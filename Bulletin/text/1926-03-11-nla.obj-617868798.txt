During recent years the uses for Australian leather
have increased extensively. This has been due to the
great improvement effected by the tanners of Australia
in the quality of the leather they produce and in the field
of upholstery leather. It has also been due to the very
marked superiority they have shown in making leather of
colors and designs that are appropriately beautiful for
all uses.
An appreciation of these facts on the part of the
public has created a very definite demand for these
beautiful leathers for the interiors of closed cars. A
number of the manufacturers of the high-class cars have
adopted leather of beautiful design for several of their
standard closed models, such as sedans, coupes, etc.
This trend is not only due to leather s beauty, but
to its superiority, utility, its hygienic value and its long-
wearing qualities.
Ask for Australian Enamelled Motor Leather. It
is the best.

The Red Page
A Jewish Life of Jesus
Recently the cable quivered with sensa-
tional news of flutterings in the dovecotes of
Israel induced by the remark of Rabbi
Stephen Wise, of the Free Synagogue, New
York, that the Jews ought to accept Jesus
as a teacher. Wise’s statements were made
in a critical pulpit review •of Jesus of
Nazareth, His Life and His Teaching, by
Dr. Joseph Klausner, written in Hebrew,
but translated into English by Dr. Herbert
Danby ..(Macmillan’s). The book is a re-
markable one in many ways; the degree of
ks remarkableness can be gauged by what
another distinguished Jew, Dr. S. M. Mela-
med, says of it: —
For the first time in nineteen hundred years a
rabbinical Jew discusses the life of Jesus without pre-
judice, and, instead of continuing the old Jewish
tradition, makes an end of it, and goes a step further
by representing the founder of Christianity as the
embodiment of religious and elhical idealism. He does
not propose that the Jews should accept Jesus as
Christ, but he does propose that they should accept
him as a great ethical personality. The revolutionary
character of this proposal can only be understood
and appreciated when one considers that it was made
in Jerusalem by the foremost orthodox Jewish scholar
of our time, and that innumerable Jewish generations
had come and gone without pronouncing the name of
Jesus.
In the library of the British Museum the
books on the life of Christ —leaving out of
consideration those that are merely general
polemics on religion—outnumber the massive
library of Sliakspearean reference three
times; Napoleon, who has a literature, of
his own, is, incidentally, a very bad third.
But in that mass of literature this new book
takes a place quite unique.
Dr. Joseph Klausner is a writer whose
standing in Hebrew letters was so highly
regarded that he became the successor of
the doyen of Hebrew literature, “Achad
Ila’am,” as editor of the Ha-Shiloach, the
foremost magazine in pure Hebrew; he sac-
rificed considerable material prospects to
settle in Palestine, where he is now Lecturer
in Hebrew Literature at the Jerusalem Uni-
versity. There can be no doubt of his
authority as a representative of Jewish
scholarship; and he devoted 15 years to the
careful compilation of his “Life of Jesus.,”
which had been published for three years in
the Hebrew before the'English translation
appeared apparently the translator has
been as careful as the author.
Hitherto the .Jewish consideration of
Jesus has been of an oblique nature, such
books as “Jewish Sources of the Sermon on
the Mount,” by the Rev. Gerald Friedlander,
and “Studies in Pharisaism and the Gospels,”
by Dr. Israel Abrahams, who died a couple
of months ago in England, being typical.
For centuries Jews mentioned Jesus not. at
all or not by name, the usual reference being
to “the Nazarene” ; but during the last! half-
century, or slightly, more, there has been an
increasing inclination to the study of His
life and doctrines, always on side-lines of
analysis, until the publication of this book,
which gives direct consideration to the
founder of Christianity Himself (if He, and
not St. Paul, can be held responsible), and
a graphic description of Ilis times. The
usual disposition has been to show that the
doctrines of Christ were only a parody of
Talmudical philosophy. Such sayings as
“Do unto others as you would be done by”
certainly had an earlier place in Talmudical
teachings.
The most interesting feature of the book,
from the point of the unattached thinker,
is the reiteration of the Jewish acceptance
of Jesus as a man who really did live about*
the time assigned to Him (there is extreme
doubt of the exactitude of Christian chron-
ology) and was crucified. The agnostic and
the atheist, who are in their own way the
most fanatical of religious people (we all
have our religions), consider that they deal
a knockout blow to the divinity of .Christ by
the denial that He ever lived when, entirely
to their own satisfaction, they prove that a
reference to Him in Josephus is an interpola-
tion ; but the Jew, being entirely unconcerned
about any claim to divinity, is perfectly pre-
pared to credit Jesus the teacher with actu-
ality. That He is an ethical teacher who
should have the reverence and earnest con-
sideration of the Jewish people is the new
startling doctrine.
The sensation following Rabbi Wise’s
utterances had a result which in itself is
rather remarkable. Wise is a leader of the
American Zionists upon whose support the
building up of Palestine as a Jewish State
mainly depends. That movement enabled
Dr. Klausner to go to Palestine, whence he
published his book. The book travelled back
through Europe, and its English translation
prompted Wise to make remarks which
created an uproar in Jewry at a time when
he was the official head of the American
Jewish National Fund, which is concerned
in a “twenty-million-dollar drive” to secure
money, partly for a special Jewish land-
settlement scheme in Russia, and partly for
Palestine. Seeing the prejudice he might
occasion to the fund, Wise promptly put in
his resignation ; but as a gesture of confi-
dence ' the Jewish philanthropist Nathan
Strauss sent in a cheque for 150.000 dollars,
others followed his example, and Wise was
finally asked to withdraw his resignation.
So what threatened to be a stumbling-block
will probably assist the American money-
gatherers to collect the amount they wanted
rather earlier than was expected.
SCHNORRER.
Does “Education” Educate?
It has been my lot in life to belong to a
profession whose members, if you will for-
give the quip, get there by degrees. When
one thinks of tly> contents of the trains
moving in fan-like directions from the capital
cities on the last, or at least penultimate, day
before the beginning of the school year, how
solemn one should be! Just try to imagine
that tremendous aggregation of pedagogical
impedimenta moving outwards towards the
rural schools of the State. If anything
should happen to one of those preciously-
freighted trains a thousand schools would be
rendered desolate, five thousand simultaneous
conversations (or do I mean soliloquies?)
would suddenly cease and be lost for ever
the seemingly inhabited world would be en-
veloped in silence as with a garment. It
is too horrible even to contemplate.
Recently I chose an individual out of this
mass of pedagogues. He is, in the eyes of
the world, a highly-educated man. Don’t
imagine that I seek to disparage my owu
Alma Mater when I add that he is an alumnus
of Melbourne University, of which he holds
a Master of Science degree besides a couple
of others in Arts and in Education. He is
a good fellow, one prominent in his profes-
sion ; a man for whom I have a very real
esteem. I trust he may not hereafter be
seeking my scalp. After a lapse of years since
we had been college mates, we met and
talked about the old, familiar faces. It
occurred to me to feel the pulse of his re-
ligious experiences. In doing so, the name of
Darwin inevitably came up. “Well,” said
my friend, who, mark you, is a Master ot
Science, “I really must look into the Dar-
winian theory. Perhaps there is something
in it.” I regard this as one of the most
significant statements uttered in my hear-
ing. . . . . .
Just ponder it. Here is a man, highly
educated in the academic sense, the fair
flower and product of our university system,
a distinguished authority who lias written
text-books on his subjects, a- science man,
educated under half a dozen of the. most
prominent professors on earth —and in the
year of grace 1925 one of the greatest con-
ceptions of the human intellect, and one that,
has colored all thought for three-quarters of
a century, has yet to percolate„into his mind.
Of course you will hit upon the explana-
tion at once —it is the result of specialisa-
tion; Watertight compartments in the mind.
Has his education educated him?
Every man is consciously or unconsciously
judging every man with whom ho comes into
contact. One sets little tests for . one’s
friends: do they pronounce “aeroplane” and
“laundry” in the orthodox manner; do they
know the correct way to pronounce the name
of the Federal capital; do they really see
any difference in the worth of, say. Eliza
Cook’s “The Old Armchair” and Francis
Thompson’s “O World Invisible, We View
Thee”? Are they really interested in the
Heaven-sent performances of Violet Vanbrugh
in “His House in Order,” or is “The Up-
heaval of Rosie O’Callaghan” the apple of
their eye? Whether one notices or not, one
puts the acid on the so-called “educated.”
And, as the poet says, one finds all is not
gold that glisters.
You will object, however, that I am apply-
ing unduly severe tests, to young scholars
fresh from the universities. Not so. That
Master of Science will never sec 40 again.
Those graduates who unbend over Ethel M.
Dell and Nat Gould what time they could be
reading Thomas Hardy, Meredith and Sheila
Kaye-Smith are not merely callow youths
whose taste is in the formative, stage; they
are merely men whom education has not
educated. ,
In a splendidly-knit passage in ’Man and
Superman” G.B.S. shows that this disease
is not confined to Australia. Denouncing
the wealthy leisured class, the Irish MoliSre
says:—
Yonr friends are not beautiful: they are only
decorated. They are uot clean, they are only shaved
and starched. They are not dignified: they are only
fashionably dressed. They are not educated•: they
are only colleye passmen.
Instead of laboring the argument that
present-day education does not educate, I
shall leave it for your consideration, for, as
you investigate facts, you will, I fear, be
driven to my conclusion at pessimistic mo-
ments —-that people become educated in spite
of so-called education. Instead, then, I shall
try to indicate what, as it seems to me, the
really educated man would be like.
Psychology, while, of course, holding the
mind to be one and indivisible, is willing to
consider it from thi’ee aspects—the knowing,
the feeling and the willing.
The educated man is developed on the
knowing side —not that he knows everything
or seeks to do so; far from that; but. he
knows how and where to secure the infor-
mation he requires. He has intellect ; the
power of grasping and assimilating new and
even repugnant ideas is his, for his education
has lifted him far above the reach of mere
prejudice: he can judge any case on its
merits as far as his knowledge goes, but he
knows his knowledge to be severely limited,
and he abhors an insular, narrow view on
any subject. In fine, his mind is free. This
consummation is the fine flower of the edu-
cational tree.
Secondly, his will, i.e., his volition, is
forged. He is able to choose between motives.
There is a bigness about his choice such as
the uneducated (who are by no means the
unschooled, remember) will never know. lie
has the power of concentration, without
which one probably never reaches the ranks
of the educated: the.power to hold a subject
of one’s own free will before the focus of
consciousness may be reached only by yeai’S
of arduous trying, but the really educated
man has it. The truly educated mind is
master in its own house. No. amount of
pleading “I meant to do it” will avail: to
think is the moral act.
Again, lie will be developed adequately
upon the feeling side of the mind, llow very
much of our lives depends upon emotion!
Art, music, literature, religion, love: are
not all these for the most part fine emotion
adequately expressed? The educated mind
is attuned to large sympathies. How nobly
our own race rises to this test! The gesture
that sent help to a Japan shattered by cata-
clysm and eclipse betokens a most, encourag-
ing amount of education on this side within
the consciousness of the Australian. Our
interest in rhythm, tone-color, music, argues
in the same direction. The root of the
matter would seem to be in our people.
True education is balanced. The truly
educated man is developed upon the know-
ing, feeling and willing sides of the mind.

ALEX. O. WRLSH.
Nil Nisi Bunkum
St. John Ervine is an Ulsterman who
started life in business in Belfast, That
drove him to literature. Now he appears as
Parnell’s Boswell. He never saw 1 arnen
in his life; he has not been intimate with
any of Parnell’s colleagues. But he sat
down with the five lives of Parnell already
published; he looked up the files of old
newspapers and had access to scrappy in-
formation supplied by the widow ot Parnell s
brother. The result is Parnell: A Bio-
graph 1/ (Ernest Benn and Co.). I am not
sure by whom biographies ought to be
written, but I am very certain they ought
not to be done like this.
Ervine regards the Celtic Irish with a
very furious sort of hatred. He allows them
nothing but “a capacity for journalism, which
is principally gossip, and the native Irish
talk well.” For him all Ireland is divided
into two parts. That in which the Anglo-
Irish move and have their being, and the
Celts. The Anglo-Irish, he tells us, did not
become more Irish than the _ Irish them-
selves, for they preserved their Anglo in-
stincts intact. Historians who state they
intermarried with the native Irish are wrong.
This is not the usual geographical division
between North and South, for the Anglo-
Irish are found all over Ireland. They pro-
duce, from generation to generation, a Shaw,
a Yeats, a Stephens;—and, of course, a St.
John Ervine. All “Irish” culture is main-
tained, fostered and handed on vastly im-
proved by them. The Celts are still,
apparently, barbarians. They have no aris-
tocracy—nothing, in fact, but the shining
light of Anglo-Irish culture to guide them.
This is the gospel according to St. John.
Parnell is a hero to St. John Ervine. He
confesses he began to write with a feeling
of prejudice, but ended with a deep affection.
This is not altogether surprising, since, of
the five lives Parnell which were available
to him, three were written by members of
the Parnell family. Thus the purpose of
the biographer in writing this book was to
explain—-somehow or other —that Parnell
was Anglo-Irish.
Parnell was born of an American mother
and a father whose forebears had been settled
in Ireland since the Restoration. Pie was
born in Ireland. Ervine has examined the
Parnell pedigree, and finds it uncontamin-
ated by record of intermarriage with the
native Irish. Is a third-generation Austra-
lian, whose family shows no record of inter-
marriage with the aboriginal stock, an
Anglo-Australian ? Still —Parnell is Anglo-
Irish to St. John.
The Celtic Irish, he admits, occasionally
throw up a Davitt. but they never accept
him as a leader. They select leaders from
the aristocracy, and, since they possess no
native aristocracy, they always import them.
One wonders if Ervine has ever paused _to
examine the pedigree of De Valera, of Collins
or of Cosgrave. However, the Parnell
family fortunes were founded by a Congle-
ton mercer; in a subsequent generation they
produced a Peer ; that is good enough. The
Parnells were aristocrats.
All the members of the Irish party are
relegated to the Celtic Inferno. They pos-
sessed the slave mentality of the peasant.
Ervine mentions very few of them individu-
nlly. He dominates them all by the over-
powering figure of his hero. The cold, blue-
blooded leader saunters .from obscurity
through triumph to tribulation —alone. We
gather that he did not know all the names
of the members of his party. “Who is that
man?” says the chief to a friend (an Anglo-
Irish friend, we trust). “Oh. that’s So-and-
so: he’s a member of the party.” “Well,
really, I did not know we had one so ugly,”
says the handsome aristocrat.
It was “the dark and detestable things
which lurk in the Celtic soul” to which
Ervine attributes Parnell’s ruin. He does
not attempt to justify Parnell’s right to
commit adultery. He is content to infer that
the members of Parnell’s party were not all
pure. He quotes the number of illegitimate
children that one member was supposed to
be responsible for, and a third-hand story
about the number of barmaids who shared
the affections of another. Tim Ilealy is
“an inferior sort of Papist, whose piety is
unconnected with any sort of charity.”
There are pages of his abuse of his former
leader. The “party” was Celtic-Irish. To
these naturally he throws his hero. Thus
falls the house of Parnell in this historical
novelette.
If one had never heard of the O’Shea
divorce suit, and knew nothing of the tragic
histoi-y of the Parnell family, the book might
be interesting from a certain point of view.
But actually Parnell’s private life has been
a matter ot public property for the past
50 years. Even his widow sold his love-
letters to her publisher. Ervine does not
throw any new light on the complexities of
the man’s make-up. He has no further in-
formation to give us as to why O’Shea ever
instituted divorce proceedings. These things
would have been interesting had Ervine
known anything about them and told what
he knew.
In truth, Parnell loved power far more
than he lowed his country. Perhaps we all
do. He rated his country well lost for the
enjoyment of a woman’s love. That has
happened "before in history, but it is inimical
to the business of being a pati-iot. Had Par-
nell vacated the throne willingly, what might
Ireland have beesn to-day? St. John Ervine
might have been spared the apparent cause of
all his bitterness; and he might have found
something beautiful in the Celtic soul, if
God had given liilm the grace to see it.
GERALD DILLON.
Podsnappery in Criticism
One remembers tflie evening party at Mr.
Podsnap’s, and the poor foreign gentleman
who was perpetually browbeaten and set to
rights, and the polite plaintive-
ness of his apologjv—“Pardon, I am alwiz
wrong!” It is queer that, in spite of
Dickens, the spirit of Podsnap should still
haunt the august places of literature and
criticism.
Matthew Arnold was the most dexterous
practitioner of what one may call the higher
Podsnappery; but we need not hark back
to him —except in so far as it is good tor
our souls to remember that there was a time
when the most authoritative critic of king-
land, the self-appointed mentor of his own
nation, could tell a people like the French
that their language was utterly incapable ot
poetry. There have been, since his day, ex-
amples enough, both delightful and instruc-
tive. , , ,
George Saintsbury—and long may he enjoy
his well-merited rest! —is a most charming
companion in letters. He has devoured
whole literatures with an immense gusto and
can convey it to his reader directly. As a
causeur, well and good, we will pass him all
his oddities, whimsies, crankinesses and idio-
syncrasies. But when he takes himself seri-
ously as a critic —and he knows how to
assume the regalia—it is another matter,
and we sometimes find Podsnap under the
professor’s robe. In his history of French
literature (a dull book, by the way) he had
scanned certain early French verses by the
laws of quantitative metre (and, by the way
again, despite his vast interest in and know-
ledge of prosody, his theories fail anywhere
to commend themselves). No less a man
than Gaston Paris ventured on a polite
objection. Saintsbury’s answer is still in
print—to him that was just another proof
of how hard it was to get a French ear to
feel quantity. Mr. Podsnap did say: Our
adverbs do not end in -mong” ; but lie did not
go on to say : “And yours ought to end m
-ly, if we could only get you to feel it.”
Again, it is elementary politeness in criti-
cism that a foreigner—even an Englishman —
should take into account the general opinion
and judgment of another nation on its own
writers, or, if he ignores it, not flaunt that
fact. Saintsbury, in the last volume of Ins
“Epochs of European Literature” —a work
planned and intended to be the ae\v
Hallam,” the first comparative history ot
literature in English—goes out of his way
(for by his own schemes only the last six
years of Heine’s life come within the scope
of his task) to taunt the Germans with their
annoyance at the English treatment of Heme
as the one glorious exception in that other-
wise just tolerable literature. Now I will
ask forgiveness if I show too plainly the
dyer’s hand; but things become interesting
and generalities only get sap and savor tor
me when one can pursue them into that fine
detail which furnishes the crucial instance
and the vital test. Saintsbury quotes—lie
had to ;he ought not to have done so. the
direct quotations one could pass over with
a smile; but there was a reference — the
meaning of yellow roses ’ —which set me
searching my Heine. I found it and hoie
it is; not in verse, for it can’t be done at
least. I don’t trust myself to reproduce the
stumble of the last line; I hope my word
will be taken that nothing of the original
evaporates in this plain prose:
What is the meaning of yellow roses?
Love that fights with anger,
Anger that love damps ;
To love and yet be angry.
If this were “tiny seed-pearl of song” (which
it is not) it would even then, in theme and
scale of concentration, directly challenge
comparison with “the captain-ruby in the
carcanet,” which is, in this kind (Catullus
85) :
Odi ot amo. quare id faciam, fortasse requiris;
nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior.
Prose cannot harm that —verse would;
I hate and I love. Why do I so perchance you ask;
I know not, but I feel it happening, and am on the
rack.
(faciam, fieri: he doesn’t do it, it happens
in his despite.) If, as Mackail says, an ode
of Horace goes as pallid as ash beside the
fire of Catullus, what becomes of Heine s
forced prosaic conceit beside this almost
matter-of-fact simplicity in the utterance ot
intense spiritual agony? And what ot Ins
eulogist? . .
Just another amusing instance from an-
other region. Adolphe Rette was, over ol
years ago and for some years following,, the
most ferociously atheistical and anarchistic
of French poets; as critic and reviewer,, a
verv Apache of letters. The time came when
his poetic vein failed and life took. its re-
venge on him. Like his master Verlaine and
many another, he found grace and returned
to the Church. Naturally he inaugurated
his new literary career with an account ot
his conversion and what went before it, and,
as he had always kept up some connections
with English, he sent a copy for review to
the organ of the Meynells. the Dublin
Review. You would have thought that his
fellow-Catliolics across the Channel would
have rejoiced over the sinner doing penance.
They did: but they could not help speaking
of liis earlier wickedness —wickedness such
as an Englishman can have no idea of. Mr.
Podsnap again, and his Englishman s com-
bination of qualities, a modesty, an indepen-
dence, a responsibility, a repose, combine,
with an absence of everything calculated tr
call a blush into the cheek of a young
person.”
There is a moral. Podsnap is an English
man; so is his creator. The English ma;
be arrogant, dense, opinionated; they haw
produced a greater number of men of geniu
to hold the mirror up to them than any othe-
race. If there should be a people whic
thinks that it has a special mission to dis
cover in the Englishman a miraculou.
blending of hypocrisy and stupidity (Peck
sniff and Sapsea), let it beware of believing
overmuch in its mission.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
Wigs and Gowns
The first day of the first law term, when
the Judges of the Supreme Court assemble
in Banco, fresh and alert as any body of
schoolboys after a liberal vacation, is the
legal red-letter day of the year. For weeks
the pail and the broom have been driving
out the collected dust of long vacation;
even the atmosphere of the court, which
clings to it closer than a brother, seems to
have undergone some purification. Fashion-
able ladies in summer costumes fill the jury-
box, and round the barristers’ table congrc
gate King’s Counsel —who for the greater
number never saw a king—in their mos'.
gorgeous apparel. Then a rustle, and, as all
rise, the Judges, whose scarlet robes and
full-bottomed wigs give color and a sugges-
tion of cauliflower to the sombre tones of the
chamber, file on to the bench, clutching their
cumbrous petticoats to seat themselves. This
first-of-term is to the law what the opening
day of the spring sales is to the shopkeeper
—though their Honors have no bargains to
offer. There is a great crush in the body of
the court, where the Bar assembles, the
foremost places filled by the well-briefed,
while the juniors and the newly-called take
the modest places left. In the matter of
clothes, the younger the barrister and the
fewer his briefs the fresher his gown and
the whiter his wig. By these signs shall ye
know them.
It is the heart of the wo»st month in our
Australian summer, when really sensible folk
would be wearing cellular textures for under-
clothing and white duck for outer vestment.
You couldn’t possibly justify this collection
of scarlet-robed and silk- or stuff-habited
folk on any ground of hygienic fitness; and
as to the wigs—in such a climate! It is
all tradition, and tradition is one of those
subtle influences that not even a democracy
can wholly exclude. If you could look
into the heart of the criminal in the
dock you would find that even he is
in a ' way enjoying the prospect of
being sentenced by “a real Judge,” one
in wig and gown. The hardened offender
who appears in the Police Court treats that
humble tribunal with scant respect. The
presiding magistrate is a “beak,” “a bleary
old bloke,” or anything else of small account.
He isn’t a Judge: he wears his own hair
(if any).
Yet their Honors’ adornment is not im-
memorial ; in fact it is a custom of com-
paratively recent origin. The wig, or peruke,
arose out of a bit of sheer snobbery. Louis
XIV., of dubious memory, had bestowed
upon him by nature a fine head-covering of
flowing locks. His courtiers who were not
so endowed betook themselves to wigs—a
fawning compliment to majesty. Then
Louis, as time waxed and troubles worried,
found his hair growing scant, so he, too,
donned a wig. The foolish custom spread
from the French Court to that of our own
Merry Monarch, who paid in compliments
what he owed in cash. Then everybody who
was anybody wore a wig. It was the re-
spectable thing to do, and of course the
Church, and quick upon her heels the Bench
and Bar, put their heads into wigs. On
through the Georgian period up to the Vic-
torian reign the custom more or less sur-
vived. The Church and the Law were —
excepting, perhaps, the coachman and the
flunkey—the last of the old wig-wearers.
Finally the Church —which never had the
staying-power of the Bench —cast the horse-
hair out of the pulpit, and only the Law,
with the few humble exceptions mentioned,
continued its employment. Of use in any
practical sense it has none: it is dirty, ill-
ventilated, and eventually makes the wearer
bald and provokes grave profanity; but by
a twist of the tyrant tradition it has become
the symbol of dread authority.
With the wig came in the use of hair-
powder ; indeed, so general became its use
that Pitt the younger, with a hawk’s eye for
revenue, proposed to make a new sort of
poll-tax out of it. That settled the matter,
and a rapid decrease in the sale _ of it fol-
lowed. In the Old Country their Honors
still have their wigs powdered; but it is
very doubtful, looking at the rusty and
often bristling mops that bob up and down
in the body of the court at the openmg-of-
term in this less conventional part of the
Empire, whether many grains of powdered
chalk dust the horsehair of our Bar.

That is the burden of this unconventional garden-
book, which has more to do with sympathy than
seeds, with beauty than bulbs.
A. H. Chisholm bids bards of the bush to
be of good cheer: —
Writing on the Red Page a few weeks ago, I
showed something of the good work that had been
done recently by Australian versifiers in response
to the invitation of the birds of their country.
That article was in some measure a correction of
a school-marmy lecture by “J.M.D.,” who has since
rent the veil asunder and declared himself to be
“James Devanev” —rather after the fashion of Dog-
berry shouting: “Dost thou not suspect my place?”
There is no need to reply to that in detail. There
would be no need to reply to it at all but for the
fact that one or two bards seem to have been
slightly' awed by the Revelations of James and his
lofty impeachment of “erroneous ornithology” in
certain verse. Now, I merely' want to say to those
bards, and any others who chance to be listening,
that it would be a sad waste of emotion on their
part to grieve over their shortcomings on the say-so
of James Devaney, whose valuation of himself “as an
ornithologist” has to be rejected. *>o, then, and
without discussing further what I have already'
written as to the material for an anthology of bird-
verse in Australia, I abjure our bards not to
be scared away from their kin-spirits of the air by
stagey chatter about faulty ornithology, no matter
how touching the simple faith of the showman in his
ow-n gifts. They may err as to points of material
fact, but so long as they preserve the spirit of
fact, so long as they shake out their carols with some-
thing of the freedom of the birds themselves, they
have scant need to fear the schoolmaster’s cane. Said
the London Zoologist, reviewing “The Birds of
Tennyson”: “Is the poet to describe or idealise a
bird? We incline to the latter hypothesis The
poet is always greater than his facts.... It may' seem
irony for a zoologist to seek to defend poetry from
the claims of his own science, but, though tbe poet
ceases to be one when he is untrue to nature, he is
still outside all the ologies.”

Reliability
57 Motor Bicycles entered—l 2 finished.
4 B.S.A.’s entered—4 finished
I his was the result of the Reliability Trial for the Champion-
ship of Holland, held on November 21, and it again emphasises
the outstanding superiority of B.S.A. Motor Bicycles.
Three B.S.A. 3.49-h.p. O.H.V. Motor Bicycles were 2nd, 3rd
and Sth in the Trial, irrespective of Class, while a B.S.A.
4.93-h.p. machine was third in the 1000 c.c. Class. In addition,
the B.S.A. was the only team to secure a Team Prize.
This is only one of many similar successes, and speaks volumes
for the consistent reliability of B.S.A. Motor Bicycles. This
reliability was recognised by the South African Police Force,
when recently, for the first time in South African history, three
members of the Johannesburg Police were mounted on motor
bicycles B.S.A. 4.93-h.p. machines being chosen.
Follow the example set by thousands of enthusiastic B.S.A.
riders and have a machine that will carry you wherever you
want to go. Remember that

Between a wall of flowers and the sea
The lamp of laughter swings;
And in the dark protection of a tree
Night folds her tired wings.
The sea has caught the last dropt flake of
light;
Green paddocks, stretching far,
Sleep quietly within the folded white
Smile of a watching star.
But in the city men in starless rooms,
Where never moonlight gleams,
Fight in the terror of created glooms
For the sad stuff of dreams.
Holding the better part I have enough,
Being not rich nor poor;
My home is carved of honor’s splendid stuff
And love sits at my door.

The Road Builders.
As light of foot and light of swag
From dawn till dark we strode,
We thought of them, the toilers gone,
Who made the Mountain road.
From dawn of day till death of day,
Soured men, crime-stained and soiled,
With sullen eyes and leaden hearts,
’Neath lash and curse they toiled.
No time was theirs to rest awhile
Tired hands and weary feet;
Leg-ironed men and arrow’d men,
They slaved through cold and heat.
Through groves and glades of gold and green,
’Neath skies of peerless blue,
With lash and curse to drive them on
They hewed and delved and drew.
And when at night cold moon and star
Across the heavens crept,
Their marrow chilled by mountain-frost,
Like herded beasts they slept,
While winds of night above them sighed
Hope’s mournful requiem—
God knows what dreams of other days
Drew in to torture them!
Things better dead, things cursed by man,
Growths warped and wrought awry,
Shapes shaming God’s good, gladsome earth —
’Twas well that they should die!
With backs criss-crossed and bodies bruised
They passed, these less than slaves;
Hard by the mountain-road there lies
Their lonesome place of graves.
Though rough the track they trod in life,
Though drear and lone its end,
Above them, kindlier things than men,
Tall trees, soft-sighing, bend.
And times there are when mountain mists
Make moist their place of leaves,
As though with sweet solicitude
Great Nature mutely grieves.

Night Thoughts o’ Darby.
When the lamps of the Yarra-side bar the
stream
With the golden stairs of a Jacob’s dream ;
When the twin fat moons of the station clock
In the mellowing midnight maze and mock;
When the last tram rattles and roars from
town
And the silence of night steals quietly down,
Oh, it’s then I hear the falling
Surf at Darby calling, calling!
Oh, I must go back to Darby with its green
and gold and brown!
When the bells of the city chime to church
And a charm settles over the smut and
smirch;
When the shadows of evening begin to fall,
And it’s not such a bad place, after all;
When the first star-gleams, as soft as wax,
Give the touch of romance that the daylight
lacks,
Then I see the cloudbanks quaking
Round the hills at Darby breaking
And I sigh again for Darby with its misty
mountain-tracks.
The bitterest sweets are the sweets of night,
When you nearly forget, but never quite;
When the day has gone with its things to do
And the past comes swirling back to you,
And you see in the smoke of your cigarette
The dead days, alive in your memory yet
Then you catch the scent of myrtle
From Darby’s fairy kirtle
And you long and long for Darby, where yov
really can forget!

Lanes of Picardy.
I walked the lanes of Picardy
And none did say me nay
Bnt the flowers that bloom in Picardy
When Spring goes that way.
The wild flowers of Picardy
Like hosted armies stand
Amid the corn in Picardy
In the fair French land.
Beneath the flowers in Picardy
Is brave British dust:
And swords unsheathed for Picardy
Lie red with rust.
To-day the lanes of Picardy
Are greened again and gay;
But the feet that swept through Picardy
Pass not that way.
The little lanes of Picardy
Have graves beneath the green.
The old men of Picard v
Tread softly in between.

“REST OF STATE.”
New South Wales is divided, for import-
ant statistical purposes, into Metropolitan
District (185 square miles) and Rest of
State (309,247 square miles). Metropolitan
District contains nearly half the population,
and if the small towns in an area of 515
square miles just outside the boundary are
included it has now, in all probability, more
than half. It would have all the overseas
shipping but for the coal vessels which have
to be allowed to haunt Newcastle and Port
Kembla. It has all the apparatus of gov-
ernment, all the appreciable wealth, includ-
ing a mortgage on the entire interior, all the
banking and insurance headquarters and the
headquarters of every financial and trading
institution which counts for much, and when
the Broken Hill line is joined up it will have
all the railway termini (the business ends,
that is to say, as distinguished from the dead
ends). And some new figures show that
it is still striding with seven-league boots to-
wards the goal of being the one manufactur-
ing centre of N.S.W. Rest of State has a
beggarly array of decayed ports (barring the
pair of spots where coal is shipped), even
the best of which is denied railway com-
munication lest it should grow and prosper,
and become the centre of a secession move-
ment. There are railways, but they pass in
the distance. The ruling caste agrees with
that king who said he would rather reign
over a desert than over a nation of heretics,
but its idea of a heretic is one who objects
to the absolute domination of Sydney, while
he was thinking of Rome. T.n addition, Rest
of State has stationary or decaying towns
(though by way of a rare exception one may
find a place like Queanbeyan, which makes
a fleeting pile by selling drink to the Federal
capital), abandoned factories, decayed hopes,
and a lack of the stimulating influence of
unearned increment. Rest of State is very
restful. It might appropriately be called
Rust of State.
The latest volume of statistics brings the
narrative of N.S.WYs factory industries
down to June, 1924, and things are doubtless
worse now. To economise space, years are
quoted only here and there

The huge Rest of State, which lor industrial
purposes is largely the city of Newcastle,
thus showed an increase of 20,250 factory
employees in 28 years, and for one half-
decade the increase was less than one worker
per annum. The increase in the metropolis
was 89,584. Thus the progress of industrial
settlement in Rest of State was at the aver-
age rate of one worker per annum for each
427 square miles, and a great part of that
went into one old coaly town and wasn’t
country settlement in any sense. To these
facts a counterblast or pretended explanation
is persistently offered by importers, Foreign-
trade cranks and newspapers, city landlords,
Bolsheviks (they believe in the one over-
whelming city, the capture of which will be
decisive and make an end of all resistance),
and miscellaneous fools and scoundrels. Their
tale is that the pursuit of the wily “primary
industry” is the true road to wealth and to
the peopling of the land, and they say that
this settling and populating process is in
full blast before our eyes. It ought to be,
considering the many millions, mostly bor-
rowed, that have been sunk in the settlement
business, but so far as N.S.W. is concerned
it doesn’t appear to be. The Statistician
gives some estimates from which extracts
follow, the war years being omitted because
the slump then wasn’t natural: —

1923-24 . . 49,228 42.574 43,820 135,622
The dairying industry is the only one which
wears a thriving aspect, and the improvement
there is mostly due to the increased employ-
ment of females. At last advices 15,270
women and girls were engaged in the above-
mentioned primary industries, and of these
13,594 were pursuing the sketchy and elusive
cow. Further, a large number of these pri-
mary producers were of tender years, and
many didn’t rank as “wage-slaves” merely
because they were slaves without wages. Out
of the 135,622 persons mentioned in the table
as still hanging out in the primary-producing
business, the Statistician reckons 30,807
(17.979 males and 12,828 females) as un-
paid relatives. The man in the secondary-
industry line of business has at least the
saving grace that he doesn’t take his gratis
.von or daughter, or his serf-wife, or his elee-
mosynary maiden aunt to the factory with
nim.
* -tt * *
When it is added that, between 1911 and
1923-24, the number of persons employed on
mining work in Rest of State declined from
33.367 to 28.778, it would seem that primary
industry is doing less than nothing to popu-
late N.S.W., unless the building of unpayable
railways with loan-money is primary. It is
certainly primitive. Production may have
increased in some lines through the use of
more and better machinery, but even the
pathetic scrap of new employment in manu-
factures which the grasping metropolis left
to Rest of State was infinitely better than
anything which Rest of State secured out of
primary products in all their many shapes
and sizes, from the bull down to the bee.
In fact the craze for dragging all N.S.W.
exports through Sydney, regardless of dis-
tance, and the mania for making all imports
do the round by Sydney, regardless of time
and space, is a hopeless handicap. A recent
happening at Bombala tended to illustrate
this point. Treasurer Earle Page promised
consideration to the idea of constructing a
Federal railway from Orbost (Vic.) to Bom-
bala (N.S.W.). This would fill in a gap
which the two allegedly rich States concerned
apparently won’t fill in themselves, just as
the Ivyogle (N.S.W.)-Brisbane (Q.) Federal
railway is to fill in a gap which the States
interested should attend to themselves. The
proposed line would furnish the southern poli-
tician with an easier route to Canberra, and
it would add to Australia's unique collection
of coastal lines which dodge all ports in
passing. It would give the Monaro farmer,
who is too far by rail from Sydney for profit-
able business, a chance to send his exportable
goods via Melbourne, which is farther away.
But as regards access to Twofold Bay, the
deep-water harbor at his back door, lie would
still be left to hump his goods by dray, as
heretofore. This playful habit of offering the
primary producer a railway exit via one big
city 318 miles away, or via another 350
miles away, while the way to the one
50 or 60 miles away is made as difficult as
possible, is the especial reason why primary
production threatens to become a back num-
ber in N. S. Wales. The prospect of estab-
lishing manufactures in country towns is poor
enough if the present policy is to continue,
but it is the best chance in sight for poor old
Rest of State.
A DISORDERED LAND.
Mistaken pride is displayed in some quar-
ters because a much smaller proportion of
the population is in gaol than was once the
case, and because it is much happier there
than it used to be. The lack of a reliable
gaol population may be ascribed to many
causes. One is a lamentably weak police
establishment. Australia has the same-sized
force as Scotland possesses, though Scotland
has a million fewer people to be guarded and
2,944,000 fewer square miles to be covered.
The police are ill-paid as well as overworked,
and the teaching of Red Revolutionary ideas,
largely by aliens whose expulsion is far over
due, leads a large section of the community
to regard them as enemies of “the workers,”
and take sides against them at every oppor-
tunity. There is a feeble minor judiciary
administering feeble laws. The maximum
penalty is often absurdly 1ow t , while the mini-
mum consists in the offender being bound over
to come up for sentence if called upon at any
time within a short period, or bound over
in two securities —his own bit of paper for
£5O, and the bond of an equally bad char-
acter for an equal amount.
Where the Red Objective type of Labor
Government is in office, the tendency in
official places is to be indulgent to the law-
breaker, provided he professes to add destruc-
tive revolutionary tendencies to his other
drawbacks. In such cases it isn’t worth
the while of individuals, paid on a minor
scale for the maintenance of the peace, to
worry too much about the peace. This posi-
tion was especially marked at Fremantle
during the late British marine strfke,
which was fought in Australia instead ot
Britain so that it might stop Australian
exports and destroy Australian industry. Iu
the course of the last big riot the instruc-
tions of the police were to maintain an atti-
tude of passive and forbearing resistance, and
they really did so till one-fourth of their
numbpr were crippled by the onslaught of
British and foreign sailors and firemen armed
with lethal weapons. Then they routed the
rioters and made arrests. There was very
little ultimate satisfaction, for the State only
prosecuted certain of the arrestees on a very
minor charge, and didn’t collect the small
lines imposed, on the pretence that the ship-
masters whose vessels the offenders had first
deserted and then attacked had undertaken
to liquidate the bill. They had done nothing
of the kind, but that was a mere incident.
But a different view was taken, and the
executive power became both stern and high,
when a constable in the strike region was
charged with the misguided arrest of the
wrong man. the person taken in error being
Patrick Mooney, member of Walsh’s
Seamen’s Union. It was admitted that
Mooney might have wanted to be arrested
in order to make trouble, and that there was
reason to believe he “purposely concealed
certain facts concerning identification, and
had only himself to blame for his arrest and
imprisonment.” In any case, the capture of
the wrong man is common enough, but the
policeman was shot out of the force none the
less, to teach him that members of Tom
Walsh’s union must not be interfered with.
* * * *
In some Australian cities disturbances
which might almost be defined as riots or
brigandage have ceased to excite much com-
ment, and the newspaper heading “Constable
Attacked by Mob” is kept standing ready
for use. One reason why the mob attacks
the constable is that in its dull, ill-educated
mind the beast instinct has been elevated
to the status of a virtue by the teachings of
mostly-imported semi-criminals, who preach
revolution, and the destruction of “capital,’
and the stoushing of the “minions of capital.”
For another reason, the mob believes that
the next policeman is half a mile off and
won’t hear the shindy, that the chance of
any meddlesome person ringing up police
headquarters in time is limited, and that at
the worst the alibi is handy and the sentence
small and doubtful. The information that
the revolutionary push has broken into and
broken up a house is frequent. A recent
case, in one of Sydney’s populous residential
quarters, was grotesque in its way, for after
the home had been smashed with impunity
and the principal victim had been stitched
up at the hospital, and had returned to his
disordered bed, the same or a similar crowd,
assuming that the supply of impunity hadn’t
run out, repeated the performance, with rob-
bery thrown in. At Townsville, where the
Law hasn’t counted for much during recent
years, it is proposed to declare the police
force “black” unless it keeps away from the
wharves, and especially from the sheds where
goods are stored. The secretary of the Vic-
torian Seamen’s Union, local leader of the
strike of British sailors and firemen against
their own union, has presented a report in
which he proposed the erection of “strik-
ers’ barracks” to put work-stoppage on
a semi-military basis, and urged the for-
mation of a fund so that the revolutionary
party may be better armed for the hold-up.
The fund is to be created by compulsory
levies on Australian unionists, who are con-
siderably levied upon already, and by Gov-
ernment subsidies —whether £ for £ or £2
for £1 lie didn’t specify. He considered that
Labor Governments, at all events, must sub-
scribe, and he may be right, though there is
comedy in the idea of any sort of Ministry
using the taxpayers’ money to aid in the de-
struction of the taxpayers’ industries which
produce the money, and to help the closure
of its own railways to boot. The great strike
has created, or consolidated, a mass of
opinion to the general effect that any crowd
of firemen and seamen, unsober or other-
wise. also imported or otherwise, consists of
half-gods, provided they hold up British or
Australian (not foreign) ships, stop Austra-
lian commerce, and do all possible damage to
Australian industry. If they murderously
attack Australian policemen, or even private
citizens, they are complete gods. Still, it
may be said for the Bolshevik community
that it is no more anti-Australian than the
Freetraders who write to the S. M. Herald,
and froth at the mouth because the Austra-
lian agricultural-implement industry isn’t
destroyed to make room for imported goods,
and do other antics of the kind.
THE MANY WAYS TO CANBERRA.
On a recent visit I circumnavigated the
one city in all the world and in all history
which has been made on purpose to be the
metropolis of a continent, and I was im-
pressed with the number and variety of tin*
means of access. Sojourners from Sydney
and the North have three well-defined lines
of travel. One is by train to Goulburn,
where there is generally a change to a
branch dead-end line in bankrupt circum-
stances of long standing. This line has its
stoppage at Bombala, and has a tendency
to drop the Federal Capital visitor at Quean-
beyan, which is as far as he goes before
cockcrow. From Queanbeyan a mixed train
sets out for Canberra by sub-branch twice
daily, covering the five miles in 30 minutes
with ordinary luck. It begins to mix about
sunrise. An alternative railway route is
to follow the main (Melbourne) railway to
Yass Junction, where long-distance trains
also have a reprehensible habit of arriving
in the dark and drinkless hours before day.
No less than five perform this feat each
morning. Yass Junction gives access to
a cockspur line described as Yass tramway.
This leads to Yass town, and from Yass
town 30 or 40 or more miles of moderate
road lead to Canberra, and thence to Quean-
beyan. One can always get to Canberra
some way, by some description of vehicle, at
some hour of the day or night. A railway
to join the Yass Junction branch with the
Queanbeyan-Canberra sub-branch is mooted,
but even if the moot comes off it will be a
branch affair or cross-country connection.
A third route from Sydney and the North
to 'Berra is by the little steamer which calls
at Montague Island, Berinagui and Tathra,
and then brings up at Eden, amid the
neglected glories and opportunities of Two-
fold Bay. Thence it is proper and orthodox
to buzz in a westerly direction for 60 miles
up the hills per car to Bombala, which is
the climax of the branch-line already men-
tioned —the one in bankrupt circumstances
of long standing. From this pleasant but
unprogressive town the traveller crosses the
little bridge over the little river to the little
station and catches the once-a-day mixed
train by which to proceed northward 132
miles to Queanbeyan. With the wonted
cussedness of the land he arrives long after
dark. The first sub-branch train to the
metropolis, as already mentioned, leaves
early next morning.
From the South the steamboat route is
not regularly available, for lack of a regular
service between Melbourne and Twofold
Bay. Still, there are four recognised means
of access. One is by the main line from
Melbourne to Yass Junction, where the ad-
vantages of the tramway and the long road
unfold themselves as hereinbefore specified.
Another way, which avoids the road jour-
ney, is to continue north another 57 miles
as far as Goulburn, and then change to the
train on the branch dead-end line in bank-
rupt circumstances of long standing and
patronise it for 60 miles south to Quean-
beyan. This place has already been men-
tioned ; also the sub-branch to the Capital
and the mixed and early conveyance thereon.
A much more picturesque track to the
goal of desire is by rail from Melbourne to
Orbost, just beyond the Gippsland Lakes.
There one can motor between 100 and 200
miles (the precise distance has escaped me,
but they have distances to burn in these
latitudes) via the Prince’s Highway to
Eden, on Twofold Bay. The advantages of
this beauty-spot as a means of escape to
Bombala, 60 miles distant, and the mixed
once-a-day train need not be repeated. The
Prince’s Highway is in as good condition as
can be expected considering thje limited
salary at the Prince’s disposal.
The shortest road of all, and a very pic-
turesque one, also follows the railway from
Melbourne to Orbost, and then strikes boldly
up the mountains and through the forest to
Delegate, the N.S.W. border-town, and Bom-
bala, and the dead-end and the mixed train
further on. I travelled it 30 years ago, and
I travelled it the other day, both times
downward. On the second occasion, thanks
to a most capable chauffeur, I covered the
last 80 miles in 11 hours, and reached Orbost
long after dark. Nobody who has dealings
with the Federal Capital seems, whether
going or coming, to reach anything —even a
definite decision —till after dark. The last
72 miles was through dense forest, most
of it standing up, but a fair amount lying
on, or rolling down, the road.
Canberra has nominally a sea-outlet of its
own. That is to say, the Federal Govern-
ment has the right to build a railway and a
road from the big bit of the two-piece
metropolis where the Government will be
(if it ever is) to the little bit on a corner
of Jervis Bay. But the track would be 140
miles long, which isn’t so very much short
of the distance to Sydney, and it is con-
sidered doubtful if the Federal scrap of land
at Jervis Bay, being too small to make
much of a seaport, is worth the cost. Jervis
Bay has no rail connection with Sydney, and
vested interests say it mustn’t have any.
Wild conversation is heard at times about
diverting the Sydney-Melbourne railway
through Canberra, but this very expensive
trick could only be done with the consent of
N.S.W. and the financial aid and concurrence
of other States which are rather tired of
the metropolis and don’t think it much use
to them. If the Goulburn-Bombala track
•—the one in bankrupt circumstances of long
standing—was bulged a few miles west it
would pass through Canberra, which would
then be on a branch instead of a sub-branch.
But that would require the consent of
N.S.W., and it would be disastrous for
Queanbeyan (N.S.W.). which is making a
fortune by selling drink to Canberra, and for
very influential N.S.W. landowning and land-
selling interests there and thereabouts. In
any case the line is too bulgy already. Also
there would be little gained unless the abrupt-
stoppage railway to Bombala was extended
by the fairly-easy surveyed route to Twofold
Bay and into Victoria beyond, and made a
colorable imitation of a main thoroughfare.
Twofold Bay is classed by the new “Austra-
lian Encyclopaedia” among the 17 notable
harbors of Australia, but the fear, that u
might go into business in competition with


Sydney has been a fatal objection to it
since Sydney began. Canberra is down in
the south-eastern angle of Australia, and it
is difficult to find any really disinterested
reason for its existence. Its situation on
Ihe map is that of a fly in the bottom right-
hand corner of a bottle, and that insect like-
wise finds access difficult. The best way
to get away from the place is by aeroplane.
The best way to get back is to stay away
for good.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australian Motors for Australia.
The theory that Australian engineering
ability is not equal to the task of producing
a motor-car engine gets more leaky every
day. Not only has it been established that
the manufacturing problems involved are well
within the scope of the bigger and better-
equipped Australian workshops, but Austra-
lian inventors and engineers have devised
motors which do not suffer in a comparison
with high-class foreign articles. Exhibit A
is the Wege valveless engine, the invention
of an Australian. Simplicity and a low
manufacturing cost are the principal virtues
of the AVege. A few months ago a motor-car,
Wege-engined, was in Sydney. The motor
was of only 11h.p., but it has taken the car
over 40,000 miles of Australian roads to
date, including trips from Brisbane to Adel-
aido, and similar long-distance runs. Then
there is the Michell crankless engine, the
invention of a Melbourne engineer, revolu-
tionary in design but so worthy of respectful
attention that the British Automobile En-
gineer devotes pages to it. Another Austra-
lian invention is the Grayson engine, which,
like the Michell, converts the explosive im-
pulses of the internal-combustion type of
motor more smoothly into rotary motion than
does the orthodox type of engine. Grayson
also has invented a new way of feeding the
engine with fuel —a way which promises the
successful use of crude oils in high-speed
engines. Still another Australian invention is
the Kay engine, undergoing racing tests at
Brooklands (London) this year. With so
many new and good Australian ideas available,
there seems no reason why Australia should
not utilise the brains of its own sons and
keep in its own pocket some of the millions
it annually sends abroad, for motors. There
can be no longer any doubt as to the magni-
tude of the market at our doors. The Com-
monwealth and Maoriland import more petrol
motors in a year than are manufactured in
such car-exporting countries as Spain and
Czecho-Slovakia. If the various Govern-
ments would agree upon a standard speci-
fication for a touring car, a light truck and
a heavy truck, they could keep big factories
for the manufacture of these fully occupied.
Alternatively or coincidently, a conference
of representatives of the already-established
Australian motor concerns, some of the big
engineering companies, and one or two
pendent experts, such as Colonel Brinsmead,
might be asked by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment to offer suggestions for the subsidised
manufacture of transport motors. This
would probably mean the birth of a very
big industry.
The Wrong End, as Usual.
The luckless muddie of building a little 3ft.
6in. extension of the Transcontinental rail-
way in the top end of the Northern Terri-
tory, and starting, later, a 3ft. 6in. extension
from Oodnadatta into the bottom end, is
already making complications. A statement
that the terms of the contract for 352.000
steel sleepers favored British as against Aus-
tralian makers evoked a cumbersome ex-
planation from the Minister :
The sleepers are required to be delivered at Darwin.
To send them up by monthly instalments would entail
utilising the monthly service to that place, as
monthly deliveries would not justify the chartering
of a special steamer. Even if the monthly boat to
Singapore, which calls at Darwin, could undertake
their delivery the additional freight entailed would
make this proposition impracticable. The delivery
by four specific dates was deliberately arranged so
as to provide shipments of sufficient size to justify
the employment of special steamers.
And much more to the same effect. So far as
can be deciphered, if Australian-made sleep-
ers are shipped to Darwin that will be coastal
trade, and under the expensive provisions of
the Navigation Act. If British-made sleepers
arrive there direct it won’t be coastal, and
won’t be under the Act. If the Common-
wealth gets its sleepers from England it will
have to pay duty on them —pay duty to itself.
If it decides that this is the same as there
being no duty, what is there to stop it? An
idea which looks fairly sane is to cut out the
problems of the sea freight, and the special
boat, and the monthly boat, and the Singa-
pore boat, and the Navigation Act, and
Darwin, and the little crowd that will be
waiting on Darwin wharf to organise a stop-
work when the first boat arrives. That would
involve constructing solely from the southern
or Port Augusta side, but the line could be
completed just as soon that way (or sooner,
if wanted) by voting more money and put-
ting on more men. Then the Australian-
made steel sleepers could arrive at railhead
daily in the Government’s own trucks, and
the outside manufacturer would have the
outside running instead of the inside, as he
will with the Darwin scheme, and be pretty
well out of the race. But anything so simple
would take all the glory out of Minister
Pearce’s project of an incomprehensible
demi-semi-constitution for the Northern Ter-
ritory. That proposal is akin to the “master-
piece of complexity” which Sieyes devised
for France, and which Bonaparte threw at
his head, but Pearce’s pride in it is a strong
emotion. Disappointment might make him
resign, as Sieyes did.

A Frozen Lamb Export Trade for
Queensland.
“W.P.D.”: From June 30, 1911, to June 30,
1924, the total exports of frozen lambs from
Queensland were 136,832 carcases. From
July 1, 1924, to December 31, 1925, not one
was sent overseas. The lamb exports of
Victoria from June 30, 1911, to the end of
last December were 12,181,379, of N. S.
Wales 4,663,266, and of South Aus. and
Westralia about one millipn. The enormous
difference between the figures for Queensland
and Victoria is chiefly due to the fact that
98 out of every 160 sheep pastured in
Queensland are pure merino, while about 40
per cent, of Vic. sheep are crossbred. At
the close of 1924 the total of sheep for
Queensland was 18,842,264, and for Victoria
12,649,898. N. S. Wales had 87,589,314, or
nearly as many as Victoria and Queensland
added together, and more than 90 per cent,
of them were merino. With prospects of a
revenue of 15s. per head from the clip of
each grown merino, it is not to be wondered
at that Queensland graziers decline to sell
their drops of lambs for freezers; nor is it to
be expected that in the south-west, central
and north-west districts, hot and dry and
specially suitable for merinos, British breeds
or crossbreds will be substituted for the sheep
which carry the most valuable fleece. But
there is a strip of country from Port Douglas
to Tweed Heads which, while merinos will
not thrive on it, is nearly all suitable for
British breeds and crossbreds. This strip
varies in width from four or five miles to
30 or 40. The tableland in the North, the
plateau lying behind Mackay and the Upper
Burnett country, as well as the seaward
slopes of the coastal range, are no good for
merinos; but sevei'al varieties of the hardier
British stock fatten and keep healthy there
for generation after generation. W. G.
Brown, the Government sheep expert of the
Queensland Bureau of Agriculture, says that
anywhere between Mackay and Tweed Heads
and on the Atherton tableland some cross-
breds will show good profits to growers,
especially lambs for freezing. Much of the
country from Bowen to the south of Glad-
stone is now held for cattle-grazing, but in
the present state of the market for export
beef, lamb-breeding ought to give better
returns. Late cables give London quotations
for frozen beef 4d. to 4-id., and for Victorian
lamb S|d. A 40-lb. lamb carcase, then,
should give a gross return in London of
nearly 80s., which would leave a profit very
much higher than the same weight of beef.
Dorset Horn sheep or Dorset Horn crosses
are what Brown strongly recommends, and
his opinion coincides with the experience of
those who have tried them in the other
States. They are the oldest as well as the
heaviest of all British sheep. They are
remarkably immune from disease; they will
thrive where many other breeds, notably
merinos, will starve; the ewes are very pro-
lific and long-lived; the lambs are fit for
freezing or the butcher at four months —four
to six weeks earlier than other breeds. The
fleece of the pure Dorset Horn is light, and,
compared with that of the merino, of no
great value; but Dorset Horn-merino crosses
grow a saleable wool.
An Elephant with Feathers.
Fenton, M.H.R. for luaribyrnong, tried to
put a terse and businesslike question on
the notice-paper, but when it appeared it
had been so milk-and-watered down that he
declared he didn’t recognise it. The problem,
or series of problems, which Fenton drafted
read thus:—
What organisation is behind the present agitation
against Australian industries?
How much money has been spent on its nefarious
propaganda ?
How many foreigners and how many Australians
are engaged in the anti-Australian campaign?
The occupations of the individuals employed and
their emoluments?
The answers might be hard to find, but they
should be searched for, even though extra
detectives are required. Australian manu-
factures have two great enemies. One is
the communist who wants to destroy them
in the interests of the gory revolution, be-
cause poverty and misery are the best aids
to revolution. The other is the importer, or
the hired agent for outside manufacturers,
who wants to destroy them in the interests of
outside factories. Both arc largely non-Aus-
tralian, and both are utterly objectionable.
The most prevalent assertion made in the im-
porting interest is that Australia’s tariff is
“prohibitive.” Strong perjury is required to
say that about a country which has admitted
£696,387,686 worth of other people’s goods
in the last five years, and which on an aver-
age has bought each year £12,200,000 worth
more than it sold, wherefore it has pawned
the body and soul of posterity for loans to
pay the difference and the £25,000,000 or
more of the annual interest bill. It is a
pretty big cormorant who isn’t satisfied when
less than 6,000,000 people pay him profits and
commissions on £696,387,686 in so short a
time, but the importer is a record size in
cormorants. Owing to his dimensions he is
often mistaken for an elephant with
feathers. Getting down to details, the
Foreign-trade advocate is prone to wail about
the sinfulness of levying “prohibitive duties”
against our British parent in particular.
Last year the Commonwealth admitted
£27,400,000 worth of British goods absolutely
free of duty, which was almost as much as
Canada bought from the Old Man altogether,
and it admitted a vast amount more at re-
duced duties. Many crocodile tears are shed,
also, about the alleged losses of the farmer
through getting most of his machinery from
the protected manufacturer who employs
highly-paid and highly-skilled Australian
labor, instead of being supplied with foreign
wares through Shark and Co., importers and
foreign manufacturers’ agents, and paying
them handsome profits and commissions. A
suspicion is entertained that the typical im-
porter wouldn’t care, apart from his own
profits, if the Australian farmer was sizzling
in the place not mentioned in polite society.
Certainly the agriculturist in many outlying
places would be much more benefited by
access to the nearest deep-water port than by
improved access to Shark and Co.’s stock
of imported harrows, but no one fiuds the
importer showing any interest in decentral-
isation of this sort. It is probably much
simpler and more economical to concentrate
his business in the one supremely bloated
city of a big State than to have to diffuse
it over half a dozen smaller towns. Aus-
tralia must contrive to do with fewer im-
ports and fewer importers. It can't continue
to borrow at the present rate to pay for sur-
plus imports without national bankruptcy
supervening.
In Late-Victorian Days.
“Lao-daii” : There is a popular belief that
everybody nowadays is much better off than
everybody was, say, 40 years ago. This
notion is fostered by a lot of loose writing
in the papers. An ounce of fact is worth a
gas-filled ton of theory, so perhaps a little
personal reminiscence will be of value. My
father received for his unremitting labors as
a journalist £4 a week, to which he some-
times added 20s. or 80s. by dint of burning
the midnight oil. He owned a stone house
of seven rooms on an average allotment two
miles from his place of toil. He had four
children. Two girls began their education
at private schools, and ended it at high
schools. They learnt all the graces neces-
sary to the age in which they lived. They
were not asked to go out and earn their
living. The two boys started at Govern-
ment schools, went on to church schools, then
to college, and one passed through the uni-
versity into a profession. We were well
clothed, well fed, and had the normal share
of attention from the family doctor and
dentist, neither of whom was paid for by
the State. We kept white mice, guinea-pigs,
dogs, prize pigeons, silkworms, and no stern
limit was set to any other hobby that we
had a fancy for. We went periodically for
a Christmas holiday to the seaside or the
country, and on two or three occasions the
whole family was conveyed SO miles to spend
two months of summer weather at the sea-
side. We all had small banking-accounts.
My mother practised domestic economy with
great talent but no parsimony. She dressed
in the latest fashion, went to vice-regal balls,
and on the first Wednesday in every month
held a tea-and-cake salon of her own. She
did not drive her own Rolls Royce, but she
owned a bicycle, a reasonable equivalent.
My father was no pale and anxious slave to
this prosperous menage. He was a hearty
man with a great gift of laughter. He
smoked, drank beer, dressed well, and bought
good books and pictures. He likewise missed
owning a Rolls Royce; but periodically he
exchanged his old bicycle for a new one of
the latest model and explored in pleasant
company almost every corner of the country.
He actually had money to spend on land
speculation, which failed, and on Broken
Hills, which moderately succeeded. We had
no telephone, but I don’t remember that any-
body missed an appointment on that account.
We had no radio, but we had a piano not
liable to statics. The house was not made
naked and ashamed with the unaesthetic
glare of electrics. It was made mellow with
the soft light of kerosene-lamps—the sort
with which Rembrandt, Rubens and Steen
lighted their noble pictures. The kitchen
range ate mallee roots which my brother
and I chopped into handy sizes before break-
fast, and we were never without hard-work-
ing. conscientious skivvies, one of whom
washed, cooked and made beds for us —at
7s. 6d. a week, plus keep—for 14 years. It
took us as long to go by horse-tram to the
city, which was two miles away, as it takes
me to go by electric-train to the same city,
which is now seven miles away. My father
did all this on £4 to £5 a week. Is there
anybody doing more to-day on thrice as
much?
A Solo on the Loud Timbrel.
According to cables from England, the re-
port of the Royal Commission on the dis-
tracted coal industry is about due. and the
secretary of the Miners’ Federation sees
ahead “the greatest victory in the annals
of Labor.” It may come to pass, but the
available material is inferior stuff to make
victory out of. Some of the horns of the
dilemma are these :
Much more coal is produced than there is any
local demand for. If manufacturers weren’t so de-
pressed through the multiplicity of imports under
Freetrade, there might be a greatly improved demand,
but meanwhile the depression is there.
The surplus coal is exported—in other words, it
is dumped cheaply in the foreign market, so that
Britain’s competitors may have inexpensive fuel to
enable them to manufacture at low cost, and compete
harder.
The British citizen, including the British manu-
facturer, is taxed to pay a big subsidy to the coal
industry, or the men who work in it, so that they
may be able to supply cheap coal to foreign com-
petitors, and help them to compete harder.
Neither the abolition of the royalty paid to coal-
owners nor the complete nationalisation of the coal
deposits will meet the ease unless the subsidy con-
tinues. The royalty collected by the squirearchy
which owns the land which holds the coal is a big
grievance as a matter of justice, but a small one as
a matter of finance. The present Government subsidy
pays all royalties and leaves a big margin to help
the miner. The idea that straight-out nationalisa-
tion, and the turning of every coal-digger into a
civil servant, would help may be dismissed with
scorn. The British Government knows no more about
mining for coal than the Queensland one does about
the profitable running of railways, cattle-stations and
meatshops, or the Federal Ministry about shipping.
A possible line of conduct would include the
abolition of the royalty on coal production, so as to
remove a small but noisy grievance. Then it would
be advisable to open a lot more coal-using factories
and shut out a mass of imports, no matter how big
a tariff was required. After that it might be
policy to close as many as necessary of the inferior
pits, which are a drag on the industry, and stop
selling cheap subsidised coal to foreign competitors.
In the present state of affairs this export business
looks very much like selling cheap subsidised ammuni-
tion to the enemy in war time, lest the poorer
ammunition factories should close and unemployment
be increased.
It would probably be useless to suggest to the
British miner that improvement might be accelerated
if he worked a little more than 40 or 42 hours per
week, drank less (the drink bill of Old England is
remarkable), and didn’t spend vast sums on backing
the wrong horse. Proposals of the sort lead to ill-
feeling.
It is not a vision of promise, but the union
secretary appears to believe that a great
triumph can be scored somehow, and the im-
porter and the drinkmonger and the book-
maker and the foreign manufacturer and
Freetrade still be preserved.
Art Unionism.
Dear Bulletin, —i nave received an appeal
from Mount Morgan (Q.), a thousand miles
away. It was addressed to me at a street
in Sydney which I left two years ago, and
I don’t know how the appellants got on the
track of so unobtrusive a person as myself.
That faithful bloodhound, the Post Office,
traced me out. Enclosed were 24 shilling
tickets in an “art union,” and they must
have cost something to print. I was invited
to sell 20 of them, remit the proceeds, and
keep the other four for my trouble. The
iinal ticket in my collection is numbered
129,168, and if it was the very last one
printed that would represent an effort to
raise from the public £6458 and some shil-
lings. But no limit is mentioned to the
number of tickets on offer, so possibly the
number available has no particular limit
either. The subscribers are offered ten prizes
ranging from a motor-car to a bag, and the
total value of the ten is placed at £IOOO.
The money is wanted for the Mount Morgan
Hospital and Miners’ Phthisis Board, which
are certainly deserving institutions, but it
seems a most cumbersome, inadequate and
wasteful way of raising aid for anything.
It is set forth that the Mount Morgan mine
formerly employed some 2000 men, and they
subscribed £I2OO p.a. among them, or Is.
a month each. The Government subsidised
this fund at the rate of £2 for £l, making
up the subscription to £B6OO annually. But
there was trouble because wages were too
high for the value of the output, or the value
was too low for the wages; anyhow, there
had been no dividend for over live years. A
brisk mob took possession of the place
in the cause of freedom, and the work-
ings took fire, so business practically
ceased. The subscriptions of the un-
employed miners also ceased. Apparently
the callous Labor Government stopped its £2
subscription because the miners’ £1 had
stopped. When British shipowners ceased
paying to the wives and families of the sea-
men who held up their ships here an allow-
ance out of the wages which these seamen
refused to earn, the victims were mostly
healthy people, and for the workless who
made the trouble there was always the simple
alternative of resuming work. There is prac-
tically no work to be resumed at Mount
Morgan, and the people whose allowance is
stopped aren’t healthy. Some of them never
will be. The circular speaks of “many sick
and suffering patients, and no revenue in
sight,” so apparently the Phthisis Board re-
gards appeal to the Government as hopeless,
even though the amount involved is paltry
enough. Possibly the bowels of compassion
have been mislaid. So the begging habit car-
ries it to the “capitalistic” classes in other
States. A great deal has been written in
Queensland about how the manly, upstanding
independent Golden Casket lottery (which
derives much of its revenue from other
States) had put Queensland charities beyond
the employment of the old cadging ways, but
there seems to be a mistake or a hitch some-
where. The discouraging feature of the “art-
union” game is that, after expenses are paid,
there is apt to be very little left for the
“sick and suffering patients.” They come
last, while expenses are a preference creditor.

A Parable from Borneo.
“Feng-Shtji” : Agriculturists anrl their kind
are born, not made, a truism which the poli-
ticians who interested themselves in “set-
tling” soldiers on the land failed to learn
off by heart. In Melbourne the other day
I met a man with whom I had been stationed
on a small island off the coast, of tropical
Borneo once upon a time. While his col-
leagues lay in kudat chairs on shady veran-
dahs, .sipping innumerable gin-slings and
swearing that equatorial sunshine was a fatal
poison, he went out with a changkol and
cleared a patch out of the jungle. Those
who had lived on that island 20 years went
on eating pumpkin and roasted jusang and
asserting that no other vegetable could or
would be raised in such a soil and climate.
In due course the born agriculturist made
the rock blossom like the rose with prime
tomatoes and many varieties of flowers and
vegetables unknown to the indigenes. But
there was a native owner of the land. He
marvelled and was covetous, and presently he
claimed the plot and the fruits thereof. He
stole the seeds from the born agriculturist’s
perfected plants, and raised some average
specimens; but soon the noonday heat
attacked his enthusiasm, so that it wilted,
and the new products of that hungry soil
reverted to their primitive varieties. The
garden became a memory and then a legend:
and eventually a fresh generation of drink-
ers of gin-slings lay in kudat chairs on their
verandahs and swore that Borneo never
could or would produce tomatoes. Later, the
agriculturist went to Adelaide and made a
vineyard, which was profitable until the poli-
ticians set so many soldiers growing grapes
that grape-growing became unprofitable, so
that the Government had to pay a subsidy to
everybody concerned; which is a way with
Governments composed of politicians who
are not born agriculturists. At present my
friend is rearing apples some 20 miles from
Melbourne. Out of the virgin bush he has
carved 25 acres of as fine an orchard as any
in the district, where he practises wizardries,
such as growing a whole catalogue of
varieties on a single tree. He has never
had a bean to bless himself with, because, he
puts what he makes back into the soil, and
lie has done all these things in the intervals
of leisure snatched from a job in the
city. In course of time, if the wind does
not strip his trees every year as it has done
this year, he will doubtless become a loathly
capitalist. When that time arrives some
union secretary will discover that the born
agriculturist has been doing an anti-social
thing in following two jobs at once, and a
Red Objective Government will be induced to
strike the shackles off him by confiscating his
orchard. Then his Alfristones, Jonathans,
Rome Beauties and Stewart seedlings will
revert to their first parent, the common crab-
tree, from which thousands of generations of
born agriculturists have raised them.
The Meddlesome Ways of Soviets.
There will be more weeping in Communist
circles about the “economic blockade” of
Soviet Russia, for the British Overseas
Trade Department has announced that it
will stop the granting of credits to that
large and unwashed nuisance. In Russia
the Government controls foreign trade and
directs its course. In the case of Britain it
directed to such purpose that the trade,
which was fairly even in 1921, became

THE tVMISRy
THAT ALWAYS LEAVES
A PLEASANT MEMORY
quite lopsided in later times. Russia sold
about £20.(100,000 worth of goods to Bull
in a year, bought about £4,000,000, and took
the balance in cash. In addition to this the
Soviet Government’s interminable talking-
machine, Mr. Zinovieff, and other human
disturbances, persist in delivering speeches
about the perpetual meddling of their gang
with other people’s affairs. One of Z.’s re-
cent efforts was when he addressed the Sixth
Annual Gory Conference at Moscow on the
prospects of stirring up revolution in the
Balkan States, and of rousing a Bolshevik
China against Europe. Worse still, he per-
orated wildly about “the revolutionary de-
velopment of the British working classes’’
and “the prospects of severing the links be-
tween the British Dominions and the Mother-
land.” When a Government allows its leaders
of thought to perform bear-like antics of this
sort in its capital, there is no sense in fur-
nishing it with a cash balance of £16,000,000
per annum to perform with. The Commu-
nist oligarchy still has faith in its star as a
conqueror and missionary. It certainly took
over Hungary with complete success in
1919, and but for the violent interference of
a Rumanian army it would almost certainly
be raging there yet, and probably spreading.
Bela Kun, said to have Chinese blood in his
veins, was sent from Moscow to organise the
local communists, the criminal classes and
the human ddbris of the war. He) upset the
four-months-old shadow republic of Karolyi,
the professional pacifist, and ran an orgy
which lasted five months in all. Its main
features were confiscation, execution, mili-
tary rule and the mysterious disappearance
of suspects. The leaders acquired great
wealth, even in that impoverished land, but
when the invasion came a good deal of it
was dropped in the flight via the Hun
country back to Russia. Szamuelly, who
was especially disliked because of his project
for granting the Red army a three-days'
loot of the metropolis for the discouragement
of capitalists and their womenfolk (at least
the young and comely womenfolk), missed
the train by which his colleagues escaped and
was torn in several pieces by conscientious
objectors. The moral which the meddling
Sovieteers have extracted from the cases of
Russia and Hungary is that there is nothing
to fear from local valor and local patriotism
provided a tyranny is once established, pro-
vided it is a capable tyranny with a liighly-
efficient military, police and detective system,
commodious gaols and a punctual gallows,
and provided it is hard—unspeakably hard.
No tyranny of that sort, they hold, ever falls
unless the oppressed have the luck to secure
outside assistance. A famous guff-poet wrote
concerning “Freedom’s battle once begun, be-
queathed by bleeding sire to son,” but the
first-class oppressor, having located that kind
of sire, takes care that lie leaves no son.
The same bard urged his colleagues, very
foolishly, as the event proved, to trust to
“native swords and native ranks,” but with
a proper police force the native is arrested
on his way to the ranks, and disguised police
are in the ranks themselves. The incurable
habit of meddling and conspiring may yet
cause a combination of civilised Powers to
abandon the defensive, which is generally a
losing form of warfare, and seek the Soviet
out in its lair, with high explosives and other
up-to-date apparatus.

When the British seamen’s strike collapsed
in Melbourne it was a familiar thing to see
squads of sheeplike matlows with bundles
in their hands being marched through the
streets to the railway-station to be re-em-
barked on their ships. Shepherding the flock
or herd was a square-faced man with an air
of profound contempt for the army pains-
takingly goose-stepping before him. Outside
the station the docile mob would be drawn
up, harangued on solidarity by the Napo-
leonie-looking person, invited to sing “The
Red Flag” (by way of recompense for having
gone short of tucker for 11 weeks, and con-
demned their womenfolk to go shorter), and
then driven through the gates, much as jum-
bucks are pushed out into the fields after
having had their coats removed by the
shearers. The leader with the Prussian touch
was C. O’Neill, secretary of the Victorian
branch of the Seamen’s Union, who has just
put his dream of power in concrete shape
jn a report to his organisation. “The im-
mediate inauguration of a Reserve Strike
Fund, supported by Government subsidy,”
says the O’Neill, “is so essential that legis-
lation to enforce it must be placed upon the
Statute book. With five Labor Governments
in power, no reason can be advanced why
such a measure should not be introduced.”
Then he visualises huge barracks, large
enough to accommodate the faithful herd,
huilt also, presumably, by Government sub-
sidy ; likewise, strike levies enforced by law
and swollen by money from the public coffers.
Paranoia is a form of nervous derangement
complicated by delusions of grandeur.
O’Neill’s taste of power over a small num-
ber of deceived and badgered British sailors
seems to have gone to his brain.
“Buttendekry” : A drought need not be an
unmitigated evil; provided adequate prepara-
tion has been made in the way of food and
water conservation, it may be a blessing.
Although the sheepmen have by care-
ful culling and selection maintained their
flocks at a very high standard, the same
cannot be said of cattlemen. The probabili-
ties are that if hand-feeding of stock through-
out a period of drought were to become a
general practice, the cost and labor of dis-
tributing the feed and the uncertainty as
to how long such feeding would be necessary
would ensure the destruction of all but the
fairly good class of animal. Possibly 50 p.c.
of our bulls would disappear during this more
or less compulsory culling, and they could be
well spared. If a comprehensive system of
feed- and water-conservation w?re to be car-
ried out on a scale sufficiently 1 frge to enable
the bulk of our livestock to survive a
droughty period, one of the aftermaths
of drought, which possibly causes as
much disaster as the drought itself, would
be done away with. This is the reckless orgy
of stock-buying which invariably commences
after the first inch or so of rain falls, and
continues, with growing intensity, until the
market collapses. The profusion of feed and
the great depletion of livestock, combined
with the frantic scramble of most pastoralists
to buy something or other to eat their grass,
forces the market up to quite unwarrantable
heights. After the last drought very ordi-
nary flock ewes changed hands at about 80s.,
and I know one man who gave £lB 17s. 6d.
for store bullocks and lost £12,000 by doing
so. For this the banks and other financial
institutions are largely responsible. While a
drought is in progress it is difficult and often
impossible to borrow
money for stock-feed-
ing purposes; but im-
mediately tlie drought
breaks and a large
proportion of our stock
has died, money is
made available. To
advance money to save
stock from dying of
starvation, though
risky, would be of ser-
vice to the borrower
and the country at
large, whereas advanc-
in g it when the
drought is over is a
dis-service. It comes
too late to save a
single beast, and merely
leads to a fairly gen-
eral re-shuffle of owner-
ship of the surviving
animals, and that at
such grotesquely in-
flated values as to
cause widespread ruin.
DECLARING HIM “BLACK.”
“Mr. Bruce told a deputation from the Yass Chamber of Commerce (N.S.W.) that, while a by-election
was in progress, ho would not make any promise regarding the Yass-Canberra railway.”
PRESIDENT OF POLITICIANS' UNION: ”Fellow-wageplug s, by refusing to bid for votes
with public money, Comrade Bruce has broken one of the cardinal rules of this
organisation. I’ll take a motion to expel him.”
(Moved, seconded and carried unanimously.)
At least one of the bush-fires that caused
so much loss, human and material, in Vic.
has been traced to its source. The district
coroner, sitting on the corpse of the Rubicon
Valley forest, found against two employees
of the Electricity Commission, who, acting
under orders, let loose the destroyer
in burning off some logs. State fores-
try officers, by warning the men of
the probable consequences, did their duty
as far as it went, but it is obvious their
duty does not go far enough. Among the
things the Vic. Parliament must make
amends for next session is its failure to
give sufficient powers to the Forestry Depart-
ment. Another need is the putting of the
Fire Brigades Act on a commonsense foot-
ing. Although the measure sanctions the
forming of bush-fire brigades, it does not
bestow the power to trespass on private land
in pursuit of the red marauder. Conse-
quently a surly landowner can shoo his
would-be rescuers away if he feels so dis-
posed ; and some of them have felt so dis-
posed.

“Old Union Sec.” : A comic situation will
arise if Jack Beasley, president of the N. S.
Wales Labor Council and candidate for ex-
pulsion from the Labor movement, goes to
Geneva as “representative” of the Australian
workers. The delegates to the International
Labor Conference of the League of Nations
are supposed to be nominated by the most
representative industrial organisation in the
country represented; and in the exigencies
of the time when the first appointment was
made, the Labor Councils of the six States
were asked to agree upon a nomination. The
thing being regarded as a picnic, the bill for
which is footed by the Australian taxpayer,
it was tacitly agreed that the prize should
be passed round, each Council getting a free
run for its nominee in turn. This year it
became the Sydney Labor Council’s privilege
to make the nomination, and Beasley was
named; but the Melbourne Trades Hall
Council, which had its turn two years ago
when the level-headed E. J. Holloway was
sent, plumped for Bob Ross, and the
Brisbane body also put forward J. C. Valen-
tine, its president. Bruce, instead of fol-
lowing the usual proceeding, asked the Coun-
cil of Federated Unions to make a nomi-
nation, his action being probably prompted
by a desire to block Beasley, and as 80 per
cent, of Australian unionists are attached to
organisations of a federated character, the
new method seemed an improvement upon
the old one. But when the Labor bodies
ceased snarling at one another to snarl at
him, Bruce abandoned the steps he had
taken and again asked the Councils to submit
their candidate. The nominations in Mel-
bourne and Brisbane indicate a very solid
dissatisfaction with that of the N. S. Wales
Labor Council, which, in any case, has the
adherence of less than a third of the unions
registered in N. S. Wales; but the union-
official class in N. S. Wales and some other
States has a stronger respect for picnic-
rights than for most other things, and the
N. S. Wales nomination will almost certainly
be endorsed by the majority of Labor Coun-
cils. Which means that Beasley wall repre-
sent Australian Labor. And it won’t matter
a bit to Beasley if the political wing of
Australian Labor expels him for being on
telegraphic terms with the Red Inter-
nationale, as was revealed at a recent trade-
union conference; nor is Bruce likely to
interfere any more.

“Machete” : The old doubt as to a wife’s
ability to acquire a domicile of her own
while separated from her husband has,
apparently, been nailed down at last by the
Privy Council. The question is important
to Australian petitioners in divorce, for this
country boasts as many differing sets of
divorce laws as it does States, and the wife
whose husband’s domicile has often been
where his hat was has found herself in a
quandary when seeking release from him.
The Privy Council’s decision is that a wife
cannot acquire a domicile other than her
husband’s, and cannot obtain a divorce under
the laws appertaining to her domicile if it
is not her husband’s. This will administer
a check to the custom of taking up residence
in a part of the Commonwealth where the
divorce laws are easier than those of the
State in which hubby is domiciled, and it
provides yet another argument for a Federal
divorce law.

‘Blanc” : I should like to endorse “Cen-
turion’s” protest against the refusal of an
R.S.S. sub-branch to admit to membership
a Digger who had served in the A.M.P. (B.
4/3/’26). No member of the A.I.F. who
took part in the September-October battles
of 1917 in the Ypres salient but will recall
with pride the “jacks” on point duty in
and beyond that mass of ruins. Their work
was exceptionally hazardous, for they were
stationed at congested points, especially cross-
roads, which were incessantly shelled, and
we soon realised that these men were models
of efficiency, and courtesy too. There was
one especially—a lanky Croweater—to whose
memory I would like to keep my hat off.
His point was the notorious Birr Cross-road,
surrounded by hundreds of smashed waggons,
limbers, guns and animals. I don’t know
what his hours were, but I know that he
was there every time we passed by day or
night for three weeks, during which period
I was O.C. of a platoon engaged in burying
and in repairing cables and the pipe-line
forward from Lake Zillebeke. We took care
not to be on view during strafes, but they
were his busiest times. I understand that
he is still there. Perhaps it is best so, for
he may have been spared the insult of being
refused admission to a returned soldiers'
union.

“Hotiiam” : Chicago, the city which Provi-
dence once caused to be destroyed by fire, but
man insisted on rebuilding, is admittedly the
most crime-stained community in crime-
stained America. Matters have got so bad
that Chicago civic bodies have petitioned the
U.S. Senate to appoint a commission of in-
quiry into the causes of the Michigan
Gomorrah’s criminality. The petitioners
blame “unnaturalised aliens,” who have
formed an association “which levies tri-
bute on citizens and enforces collection
by terrorisation, kidnapping and assassina-
tion.” Looking on from a distance, and con-
sidering the parallel conditions reported in
other large American cities, one wonders if
the alien is altogether to blame. During the
last generation, the cult of the “100 per cent,
he-man” has taken the United States by the
ears as firmly as that of the Blond Beast
gripped the Prussia of 1914. Nine-tenths of
American literature, so-called, is publicity
stuff for this idealised hero-type, whose
powerful x>ersonality takes him rough-
shod over every obstacle, legal, moral or
otherwise, to his desired goal. The he-man
obsession is fostered beyond all bounds by
the moving-pictures. It is difficult to think
that this cult of unreasoning egoism, rammed
down the throats of the young and impres-
sionable by the realistic and ever-present
cinema, has not been a strong influence in
helping to upset the moral equilibrium of
Chicago and some of her sister cities. The
same poison, conveyed by the same means,
has caused concern even in far-away and
alien Australia.
O _
“Ancient Landboomer” : The activity of the
real-estate market in Victoria generally and
in Melbourne in particular gives me goose-
flesh ; present values of land and houses so
closely resemble the phantom prices of ’B6-
’9l. There is the same system of quick
turnover, and most of the contracts, sticking
to the custom of long ago, consist of a bundle
of promissory notes. There are very few
building societies —only nine, to be exact —
left to help the land-speculator. Between
’9O and ’93 no fewer than 37 put up the
shutters. A hotel, bought four years ago for
£92,000. was sold in 1923 for £130,000, and
it is alleged that an offer of £150,000, or
£2272 a foot, has just been refused. The
owners of another hotel property have refused
just on £5OOO a foot for their little corner
allotment. The new Argus office approaching
completion in Elizabeth-street and Latrobe-
street has caused property in the vicinity to
double in value and to change hands with
bewildering rapidity. The sale of the old
Collins-street office will pay for the new one
and leave a bit over for the Argus pension
fund. In 1891, when the land-boom col-
lapsed. the population of Greater Melbourne
was 490,896; to-day it must be double that.
So long as the flow of loan-money from
London to Melbourne continues, the real-
estate market will keep lively. Should any
check occur, the Saturday-afternoon land-
sales. with their tents, flags and beer, will
vanish, and prices of land and houses will
tumble.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Evading Opposition queries regarding
Attorney-General McTiernan’s mission to
London, N.S.W. Premier Lang rushed from
the Leg. Assembly last week, leaving liis
followers to gag their way into recess. An
increasing number of those followers and
Trades Hallers are showing signs of hostility.
One of their complaints is that a track has
been worn in and out of the Premier’s office
by H. D. Mclntosh, M.L.C., who used to be
equally thick with Holman. The McTiernan
jaunt was first announced in Mclntosh’s
paper. The same publicity channel, profess-
ing to be similarly inspired, has nominated
Judge Beeby as chairman of the new Arbitra-
tion Court at £2500 p.a. And the union
executives don’t want Beeby. They want
A. B. Piddiugton.
The Lang Government could have secured
the abolition of N.S.W. Upper House, with
votes to spare, if it had stuck to the letter
of its programme, which was that the nomi-
nee institution should be replaced by the
initiative, referendum and recall. But it
didn’t want these at any price, so its Aboli-
tion Bill was lost, as also were its measures
abolishing the anti-strike railway unions,
conferring the local-government franchise on
swagmen and thrusting four Labor aldermen
from Waterloo on the Sydney ratepayers,
who were to pay £200,000 for getting them,
while its Parliamentary Elections, Workers’
Compensation and Arbitration Bills were
more or less drastically amended. By
these proceedings, of which the Gov-
ernment never dreamed when it bluffed
Governor He Chair into appointing the
25 Labor Leg. Councillors, the pomp of
Premier Lang has been made ridiculous.
Nevertheless, Lang still prances round ver-
bally and uses threats to keep up the pre-
tence that he is the Strong Man, when he is
only the Wrong Man.
On Saturday morning the Sydney paper of
which Premier Lang is a director declared
that “Labor” had “high hopes of Eden-
Monaro being won by Mr. Morgan,” mainly
for the subjoined reasons:—
There was a revulsion of feeling against the Bruce
Government and its “wickedly anti-social” Crimes
Act. Austin Chapman’s majorities always included
a big personal vote. His personal friends were “not
likely to forget the shabby treatment of his son
by the Nationalist party.” The State Parliamen-
tary representation of the area covered by the
Federal electorate of Eden-Monaro showed “a major
volume of support for Labor.” In fact, Eden-
Monaro comprises the State electorate of Goulburn,
with bits of Wollondilly; and four of the six
M’s.L.A. for Goulburn and Wollondilly are Laborites.
On the third day of the count Perkins, the
Nationalist, had 19,065 votes and Morgan
12,704; and Perkins was expected to finish
with 7000 votes to the good. At seven of
his eight contested elections, Chapman had
nothing like that majority; in 1919 he de-
feated Harry Lewis Brown by a mere 1483.
Plainly Perkins, who was M.L.A. for Goul-
burn, has a lot to thank the Lang crowd for.
Queensland Laborites, in conference
assembled, rejected the recall with enthusi-
asm. They were quite sure the recall would
never do in Queensland, and. from the party
viewpoint, they were probably right. What
would be the use of winning an election by
pouring hundreds of construction workers
into a district if, immediately the transients
had passed on, the permanent residents could
upset the result of the poll?
The S. M. Herald in, it is hoped, an un-
inspired moment, spoke re Premier Lang’s
demand for more Upper House nominations:
The Opposition is still convinced that the Gover-
nor, Sir Dudley de Chair, will refuse to be a party
to such a move, and it believes that his Excel-
lency would rather take the extreme step of resign-
ing his office.
If his Excellency, who has done enough harm
to the Ma State without doing more, were
to take the extreme step of deserting or run-
ning away, and thus possibly leave the road
open for a deputy who would oblige the Lang
Ministry in all things, the execrations of his
once-loyal subjects would turn the air a
thick blue. Should Governor D. de ,0. want
to be even moderately extreme, but not ex-
tremely extreme, a dissolution would fill the
bill much better than a flight.
Viscountess Nancy Astor, from Virginia,
first woman member of the British House of
Commons, is possibly tired of greatness,
especially as others of her sex have poured
in and spoiled the novelty. So at a dinner
given to Mrs. Pankhurst she offered to resign
her seat if the suffragette would take it.
Evidently the United States lady had failed
to assimilate the British Constitution, and
thought seats were transferable. The spec-
tacle of her 18,000 Conservative constituents
being handed over like a parcel to Tom
Walsh’s mother-in-law would be quaint.
In the days of Ivalgoorlie’s greatness there
was a persistent demand for a railway to
Espcrance Bay, which is much nearer to the
goldfield than Fremantle is, and also nearer
to the Eastern States. Bits of line were
built, but Perth interests saw to it that a
nice gap was left to prevent through traffic.
Now that a good many of the prospects have
departed the work is being finished from a
purely agricultural standpoint. Someone has
discovered 2.000,000 acres of land there-
abouts, which seems probable enough, for
there is land almost everywhere in Australia.
A TICKLISH SITUATION.
“The Federal Country party is divided on the Tariff issue.”
When Priminister Bruce read out at Labor-
leader Charlton’s invitation a list of firms
which had purchased units of the once proud
Commonwealth fleet, it sounded like a recital
of the destinations of the tribes at Babel
when the linguistic confusion fell upon them.
Among the ravens that had gathered round
the carcase created by the job-control gang
were two Greeks, three Germans, a Scan-
dinavian, a Russian (at least lie is thought
to be a Russian) and 10 .Taps. One of the
last-named calls itself the Gosh Kaislia Sato
Shokai. It sounds like a polite foreign ex-
clamation of astonishment.
The Queensland Labor party is resigning
itself to the loss of at least four metropoli-
tan seats at the State election. Although
Labor gained a seat at the Water and Sewer-
ag*e Board polls there were anti-Labor
majorities in South Brisbane, Maree and
Kelvin Grove, all represented by Labor
M’s.L.A. At the Greater Brisbane election
last year, Labor was defeated in South Bris-
bane, Kelvin Grove, Bulimba and Merthyr,
and only scraped in for Maree with a
majority of 13 on the contingent votes, while
Ithaca declared for Jolly, the Nationalist
mayor. The Federal election gave similar
results. Brisbane, Fortitude Valley, Buran-
da and Paddington are the only metropoli-
tan seats which the Government can count as
safe out of the 10 it holds at present. And
the defeat of Theodore shows that “the solid
North” is no longer solid for Labor.
Exasperated at the police prohibition of
chocolate-wheels and the like at the St.
Kilda (Vic.) charity carnival, Watt, M.H.IL,
said the law was stupid and stupidly adminis-
tered. In admonishing William, Chief-Sec-
retary Argyle pointed out that the provision
objected to had been re-enacted in 1012 at
the instance of the Government of which
Watt was head. A much milder Watt ex-
plained, weakly, that the statute to which
Argyle referred was a consolidation pre-
pared by Cussen, J.; but Jack Murray,
Watt’s Chief-Sec., told the House that the
bill was “not a mere consolidation,” and in
any case a Ministry must accept responsi-
bility for legislation it sponsors. It was
absurd to ban chocolate-wheels at the St.
Kilda affair, but, then, the official Victorian
attitude to gambling is absurd altogether.
Labor-member Evatt, who is bound for
London along with Attorney-General McTier-
nan, lately in the guilelessness of his young
soul sketched out a plan for a N.S.W. Upper
House of Privilege, which is intended to be
for all time an immovable fortress for his
crowd, even if said crowd is in a minority in
the country and the Assembly. It is to be
elected “on an industrial basis,” which can
only be taken to mean that it is to be chosen
solely by trades-unionists who are “financial,”
having paid up all their strike levies, and
who haven’t been expelled or suspended on
suspicion of being disaffected. The initia-
tive, referendum and recall are quite out of
date with the Evatts, Langs and McTiernans
nowadays. These office-bred children of
wrath evidently think that further disguise
is useless.
One of the bright thoughts of the South-
port (Q.) Labor Convention was expressed
in a resolution instructing the Government
to limit the profits of industrial and commer-
cial enterprises. There are Queensland manu-
facturers who would not object to the pro-
posal, silly as it is, if the Labor Government
would only give them a chance to make
profits.
Stimulated by a trip to Maoriland, Farmer
John Allan. Premier of Vic., hopes to domin-
ate the Cocky conference sitting this week at
Ballarat, but he won’t worry a cent if the
extremists beat him. Yarns about plots in
the Lib. and F.U. camps to dethrone him
cause John no loss of rest. He is wonderfully
refreshing after the nervy Lawson.
Melbourne merchants find a grievance in
the terms of the arrangement with Burns-
Philp whereby Sydney is made the southern-
most port of call for trade between Aus-
tralia and the Mandated Territory. Mel-
bourne shippers are at a disadvantage in
having to send their goods overland to
Sydney or by boat, either method requiring
expensive and precarious manhandling in the
Ma State metropolis. If, however, the sub-
sidised vessels were taken to Melbourne,
Adelaide and Hobart would have a grievance
as great as Melbourne’s now is; and if Ade-
laide and Hobart were obliged, there would
still be Perth to be heard from. The real
trouble lies not in making Sydney the ter-
minal port, but in allowing a handful of
Bolsheviks to make chaos of the inter-State
shipping business.
Queensland’s stop-workers have won an-
other groat victory. On December 19 the
district railway superintendent at .Cairns
came upon a train crew idling on the wharf,
and suspended them. An investigation fol-
lowed, and the Inquiry Board transmitted
a recommendation to the Punishment Board,
which sentenced the three men concerned to
reduction in rank and loss of pay during
suspension. Then came the usual retort: a
stop-work meeting of Cairns railwaymen
(900 turned out), followed by deputations
to Ministers and a regulation strike. Finally,
an Appeal Board quashed all the sentences,
with costs against the Commissioner, amid
much crowing over the “common enemy.”
There may be no significance in the fact that
it all occurred in the Premier’s electorate.
Some Queensland employers are utilising
the time-honored methods of the wage-plug,
to the latter’s confusion. When a body of
Proserpine cane-farmers went to Bowen to
load sugar which the wharfies refused to
handle, the workers at the Proserpine mill
announced that the cane sent forward by
those farmers would not be crushed, being
“black.” The Proserpine Cane-farmers’
Association replied that it had passed a new
rule setting forth that if one farm became
“black” every other holding in the district
automatically assumed the same gloomy
aspect. The mill-hands thought it over, and
all cane grew “white” in a single night.
Now the United Growers have recommended
their district branches to try a little of the
same medicine, if occasion should arise.
Minister for Customs Pratten proposes a
bounty of 4d. a gallon on power-alcohol from
cassava and other starchy plants; but French
experience doesn’t encourage the belief that
such a bounty will repay growers. The aver-
age yield, according to a French authority,
is 9 tons to the acre, and a ton yields 35
to 40 gallons of alcohol. It looks as if the
grower would have to bo content with about
16s, a ton if the spirit is to be sold at a
competitive price, and as the cassava crop
takes a lot of labor the proposition is not
alluring. In France a bounty equivalent
to about 4d. a gallon was paid on cassava-
derived plcohol, but it wasn’t enough, and
the Germans continue to supply practically
all the power-alcohol France uses.
The egregious N.S.W. Lang Government
has tumbled in public estimation, but the
n on-Labor forces in the Assembly stand no
higher than they stood six months ago.
There arc too many dull old men among
them, and some of the others have bad attend-
ance records. The Nationalists still lack
the decision to put the initiative, referendum
and recall on their programme. They have
apparently no Upper House policy, and if
they did attain to power and found on their
hands the dropsical monstrosity which Lang
and De Chair built they wouldn’t in the
least know what to do with it. The need
to get rid of it would be obvious-enough, and
the advisability of replacing it with some-
thing simple and serviceable and democratic,
such as an elective Chamber created after
the same fashion as the Senate, would be
worth consideration. But if the chance
comes it probably will find the Nats, without
any idea what, if anything, should be done,
and how, if anyhow, to do it.
From the Gallery :
N.S.W. Labor has expelled J. W. Percival and
F. H. Bryant, and the expulsion apparatus is being
oiled for the benefit of others. Percival was the
M.L.C. who went for a holiday on the South Coast
when his vote was wanted for the abolition of the
Upper House and for other purposes. He held the
idea that it was a breach of faith to get 25 nomina-
tions from Governor Deluded Chair with the implied
promise that they wouldn’t be used for abolition
purposes and to immediately so use them, and the
other idea that it would be a breach of the party
programme to abolish the Council without substi-
tuting the initiative, referendum and recall. The
excited Cabinet searched for its lost vote with
bobbies and bloodhounds. Bryant’s own vote wasn’t
available at the time because lie was paired, but
he alleges that a brightly ingenious way of making
it available was laid before him. He was requested
to declare in the House, as a matter of personal
knowledge, that Percival, M.L.C., fell or was
pushed under the influence of liquor; that Nation-
alist politicians kidnapped him in that condition
to the premises of “a Maequarie-street doctor,” who
dragged him; and that he was then put away in
cold storage. Bryant was to break his pair and
make his vote available unless the Nationalists
immediately released Percival from his cellar or
wherever he was. If Bryant had made this tangled
and adventurous statement, on his own responsibility
and as a matter of personal knowledge, he would
have fallen into a very deep and muddy hole, for
Percival shortly afterwards revealed himself, in good
health and enjoying all the blessings of liberty,
and the only thing Bryant’s, colleagues could do
would be to leave him in the hole and marvel how
he got there.

THE DEADLY SIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Some so-called Labor men had gone so far as to
almost support the Nationalist party. The trades-
union movement would not stand for that.” — Garden,
reported by Brisbane Daily Mail.
He wept, as one whose hopeless weeping
For some unshriven sin atones;
His toes from out his boots were peeping,
He mostly ran to skin and bones.
I gathered from his piteous groans
That nobody with him consorted.
His daily lot was gibes and stones:
The Nationalists he once supported.
“And did you, then,” I asked in wonder,
“Barter your principles for gold,
And hope to dodge the Caucus thunder
And shelter yet within the fold?
Like J. Iscariot were you sold?
If so, with that historic traitor,
You earned the worst that Hell can hold!”
“But no,” he said, “my sin was greater.”
“You must,” I said, “have been a noodle
To cast your vote for Labor’s foes,
But if your guerdon wasn’t boodle
’Twas some equiv’lent, I suppose.”
Dejectedly he blew his nose,
He said, “I never got a mite, sir;
I only helped them, Heaven knows,
Because I reckoned they were right, sir.”

“A little better than the last” lias long
been the policy of the City Mutual, and if
results generally have been a lot better that
has been accepted as one of tlie good tilings
a good office deserves. Consider the growth
disclosed by tlie introductory table. Income
lias expanded by £636,445 since 1915, and
lias almost doubled since 1920, in which year
the society wrote just on two millions’ worth
of new business. Not that the new business
figures show amazing progress. The City
Mutual has “tlie rather old-fashioned idea” —
as managing-director George Crowley phrases
it —that the interests of existing policy-
holders should not be sacrificed merely that
the society might speak in bigger figures.
That does not mean that there was a slowing-
up in new recruits ; indeed, the total business
notched a new record:—

Not much of the business written is lost. Pos-
sible renewals last year totalled £138,361, and
the actual figure was £406,432; the £31,929
difference represented not only the lapses,
but matured and surrendered policies. This
insistence on economy is well rewarded. Ex-
penses related to total income have been
steadily reduced, and the new business
rate has been kept within bounds despite
the many factors operating to bump it sky-
wards. Last year, for instance (on the basis
that new business costs 10 times as much
as old), the rate was 77 p.c., compared with
the 80 p.c. of 1924 and 1923 and the 83
p.c. of 1914. The office calculates that its
new business cost last year was less than
70 p.c.—“much lower than that of any other
life office in the Empire.” In any case, its
progress makes easier the catching of new
business: —

The bonuses on policies have so steadily
improved (last year continued the pro-
cess) that the office now affirms that
they are “the highest of any life-assurance
institution in the world.” In 1915 £33,687
was distributed in bonuses. That had grown
to £73,372 by 1920, and last year the sum
declared was £175,027. Those are cash
bonuses. But the society hasn’t to write
many cheques: 96 p.c. of tlie last distribu-
tion was used in the purchase of new paid-
up insurance. Factors which make possible
these big bonuses are the moderate expense
rate, a favorable loss rate and high returns
from investments. Losses by death were
lower than was provided for: —

1919.. 43,973 1922.. 50,284 | 1925.. 62,634
Investments turned in £206,062, equal to
6* p.c. on average funds. For 1924 the
return was 8.2 p.c. But all is not interest,
the amount including “profit on realisation
of securities, etc.” That calls for explana-
tion, if only by reason of the remarkable earn -
ings of the past. AVhat happened was
that there were fewer realisations dur-
ing the term, and the movements in
assets show that the , society decided
on less remunerative but more solid invest-
ments ; it may also have resolved that it would
be as well to put something aside out of profits
on realisations for a droughty day. In any
case the 6* p.c. is quite a respectable
return, particularly since the office calculates
its liabilities on the basis that funds will
earn only 3* p.c. In fact, the directors called
in consulting actuary Wolfenden to see
whether a more conservative, not to say
bilious, viewpoint could be taken of the posi-
tion. The 3* p.c. was conservative enough:
for long earnings had been round about twice
that. Now the valuation is on “the
3* _ p.c. net premium basis,” which,
plainly stated, means that no allowance will
be made for the initial cost of new business,
although it involves a considerable amount
each year. And so this office splashes con-
servatism with enterprise; conservatism in
the matter of costs and estimates, enterprise
in the matter of investments. Of course,
enterprise in investment isn’t a tendency to
be encouraged in new offices; nor in old, for
that matter. But in this case the office is
prepared to act as niglit-watchman to its
securities, and results have justified the
policy. Assets have moved in this way since
1914 :
1914. p.c. 1925. p.c.

£771,350 £3,526,349
A watchful eye needs to be kept on those
mortgages, byt, so long as the present man-
agement continues, that should be all right.
Last year investments returned £206,062 ; in
1915 the amount was £48.441. That more than
half of the City Mutual’s funds is in mort-
gages accounts in part for the high
interest return which has been a marked
feature of the society’s operations for
years. The office says that the rate isn’t quite
all it seems; that it is helped to its propor
tions by the fact that investments are under-
valued by hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Meantime ther • is additional safeguard in
a contingencies reserves of £60,000. while
£25,000 was set aside out of last year’s earn-
ings as a “reserve for equalisation of Govern-
ment stock.”

For no visible reason Carlton and United
issues its balance-sheet seven months after
tlie close of the accounts. And so it seems
like reciting history to deal with the events
covered by tlie year’s operations. Here they
are in brief :
Freehold hotel properties of Fitzgerald’s Brewery
and Malting Co., Castlemaine, Ltd., purchased ; price,
£82,500. Brewery ceases business.
Brewing goodwill and hotels of Cohn Bros., Victoria
Brewing Co., Ltd., Bendigo, acquired ; price not stated.
Cohn’s retain cordial and wine and spirit business.
Brewing operations stop.
Melbourne Co-operative Brewery Ltd., the sole sur-
viving metropolitan competitor (though not so far as
prices were concerned), absorbed. At the time of
the merger, C.U.B. capital was £1,100,000; Co-
operative, £215,448. New capital in the combined
business was fixed at £2,000,000 in £1 shares, 50,000
shares, however, being reserved. C.U.B. took two-
thirds interest and the Co-operative one-third; Co-op.
shareholder-customers to receive the old rebate on
purchases for a period of five years.
When the co. was formed in 1917 it took
over McCracken’s, tlie Carlton, the Victoria,
Castlemaine, Shamrock and Foster cos. All
but the Carlton and the Victoria breweries
were closed, an annual payment of £2500
p.a. for 25 years being balm for tlie lacerated
sentiments of those concerned. Incidentally,
that sum supplies tlie deficiency between
appropriations and reserves of the introduc-
tory table. In between Geelong Brewery
was purchased for £130,000; and if any
other Victorian beer-foundry has disappeared
in recent years this Column is prepared to
convict Carlton and United without further
evidence.
That water contains a minute quantity of
gold is a scientific fact, but there is more
gold in beer. Last year 850,000 more
shares had to be fed (ords. went from
£1,000,000 to £1,750,000 and prefs. from
£lOO,OOO to £200,000, £25,000 in premiums
appearing in the process), but profits were
equal to it, after all kinds of contingencies
had been provided for, with almost £lOO,OOO
to spare. In four years reserves have ex-
panded by £460,573, and they now amount
to £80,847 in excess of the frothy item:
“Purchase consideration (including goodwill,
trade and business connection of the vendor
brewery cos., trade names and marks, and
right to tied trade, and option to nurchase
breweries and other properties), £800,000.”
No addition was made during the term de-
spite the declared goodwill in the Cohn pur-
chase. The acquisition and the merger
affected balance-sheet figures :

Apart from the disappearance of all but a
nominal amount of deposits and the appear-
ance of first-mortgage debentures for an
almost equal amount, the changes are
wrapped up in the purchases, and it is im-
possible to trace the effects of the absorptions
or to see what was the normal progress over
the period. It is evident that Victoria did
not mislay its thirst during the 12 months,
and it is no less obvious that the Combine
did very well. Brewery freeholds expanded
by £131,000, hotels by £310,000, and plant
by £189,000. As the buildings and plant of
the Co-op. alone had a carved-down book
value prior to the merger of £328,000 the
increases are not out of the way. In any
case the items are still in at well under
tlieir value, for the greater portion of the
additions of recent years have been charged
to revenue. However, there is wisdom in
that; reserve strength is very necessary in
the case of brewery cos. At June 30 all out-
side liabilities totalled £375,971, whereas
liquid and semi-liquid assets amounted to
£1,386,807. The latest absorptions free the
way to even more substantial profits, for
economies will result from the centralisation
of brewing and of control. The 15 p.c. is
a very simple matter. But the market thinks
that the future holds something richer.

One-sixth of the population of Australia is
now grouped around Port Jackson, and this
colossal bloat has naturally profited the big
property salesmen and valuators. There has
been active buying and selling of city blocks,
for Sydney is being rebuilt. Suburban busi-
ness has been very good, but it is declared
that many people have switched off land- or
house-purchase and placed their savings in
t.-p. motor-cars. This is an unfavorable
social development, much of it representing
a definite economic waste. Australia would
be benefited more were such money placed
in reproductive propositions or stable invest-
ments. The totals here shown disclose the
expansion in real-estate transactions :—-

capital, and it could repeat tlie performance
without difficulty. Last year a few of the
unissued shares were placed; 75 remain. At
December 31 assets totalled £124,332. Allow-
ing for all outside liabilities and final appro-
priations, there was left the equivalent of
19s. 7d. for each 15s. share. Balance-sheet

The natural prosperity of the country, plus
the inevitable loan jag (a substantial sum
was distributed for cash redemptions of
Federal loans towards the end of the year),
resulted in unusual activity during the term.
The present year should be healthy, although
perhaps not to the profitable degree of 1925.
But R. and W. shareholders should be able
to bear stoically any adverse variation, see-
ing that they have had 122* p.c. in six years.
Twenty p.c. calls for £10,489, which, looking
10 months ahead, seems simple enough, par-
ticularly since the amount of deposits on
sales _ was, at £31,581, three times greater
than in 1924, an indication that the co. was
handling big business at the opening of the
present term.

In 1924 this co. had the luck to sell most
of its wool before the market broke. Its
experiences with cattle were, of course,
poorer, being governed by the low prices and
almost dead export market; and in this re-
spect things were not much better last year,
though export was much brisker. An un-
favorable season in the southern portion of
Queensland was a further detriment. Still,
though the promise in the beef position is
slow in developing, the co. is in a good
position to meet the increasingly important
southern market, for it has big mobs fatten-
ing on Springfield station —bought for that
purpose in 1922 —and on other areas. It
recognised, a bit late in the day, that cattle-
raising must be uncertain so long as world
conditions push Australian beef into a minor
place, and Tarbrax station, Maxwelton, which
had been purchased to fatten cattle from its
Gulf properties, was converted to sheep in
1923. That Tarbrax is good sheep country
is proved by the top prices which were ob-
tained both in 1924 and last year. Though
the progress thus far made is not clear,
wool-growing, in spite of the alleged menace
of sniafil, undoubtedly offers the co. a way
out of its difficulties, and the co. is hardly
likely to miss its chances. It issued £95,371
of pref. capital to buy Springfield and con-
vert Tarbrax, and this had grown to £102,366
at the last balance. With wool apparently
set at highly profitable levels, sheep have
been expensive purchases, but whatever the
co. has done in this direction should be
justified by results.

Allowing that sufficient was provided for
amortisation and wear and tear, and that
livestock was viewed with a careful eye on
the prospects for beef, the co. won little
more than enough to pay the 8 p.c. prefs;
and ordinaries may still have to wait for a
while, though given favorable conditions
there are not many industries which can
move so quickly as sheep-raising. Between
1905 and 1910, for example, the flocks in
Queensland went from 12 to 20 millions, in
spite of heavy slaughterings. There are
218,330 ordinaries, and a 5 p.c. div. would
call for about £lO,OOO more than was won
last year. With Tarbrax giving anything
like ,i decent return and the weather behav-
ing itself, that should not be difficult.

That’s better. But the directors were wise
not to increase the div., for even the modest
appropriations of 1921-24 bit £6382 out of
reserves. These were comfortable enough
in 1919, but the capitalisation of £25,000 plus
an issue of 25,000 new shares at the same
time made greater demands on a diminishing
profit. Last year marks a recovery; but
less was put by for depreciation (£324
against £1030), the directors explaining that,
as premises were worth a good deal more
than they figure at in the books, the smaller
amount was sufficient. Of more importance

Wood Pipe. Its lightness means economical trans-
port, even to the most out-of-the-way location, whilst
there is a further saving effected in the simplicity
and ease with which it can be laid. Other worth-

the volume of flow. The smooth bore wears even
smoother with time, the co-efficient of friction be-
comes lower, and the interior offers no rough spot
for the collection of sediment or growth. For a free

Stocks are creeping up. In 1920 they were
given a book value of £137,b57, and the
slump in the following year saw the pencil
busy. This time stock has been taken “at
saleable prices.” What may be saleable in
1925-26, with almost all sections in Maori-
land enjoying a prosperity based on record
wool and butter returns, may not be so
readily moved if conditions go back. Maybe
the Board thought of that; certainly under
existing conditions a conservative estimate
of stocks is the only safe one. The co. has
keen competitors, and could do with more
punch.

Chairman Bell spoke of many things at
the Boulder Perseverance meeting, the most
important being: (1) the disappointment
caused by the discovery that the good bore-
hole values which caused the shares to appre-
ciate 300 p.c. last year was in South Kal-
gurii and not in Perseverance ground: (2)
the increasing burden on mining cos. in West-
ralia in the shape of higher duties on mining
requisites, increased wages, compulsory in-
surance of workers and a Phthisis Act which
meant increased expense; and (3) that Ur.
Edwards, an expert, who held a seat on the
board, would shortly visit the mine to see
if costs could be reduced. Nothing, however,
Was said about the London office costing
nearly as much as that on the mine or of the
necessity for reducing directors’ fees, per-
quisites and expenses. Kingsley Thomas’s
damning report of Kalgoorlie management
(Lake View and Perseverance excepted) was
airily described as containing much useful
information but not sufficiently balanced to
be of much value.

Freney Kimberley Oil Co. (W.A.) is still
confident of being added to the list of wealthy
oil-finders. At the half-yearly meeting held
In Perth the other day director M. P. Durack
gleefully announced that the Federal Gov-
ernment had made available for develop-
mental purposes £22,000 on a £l-for-£l basis,
and opined that when satisfactory results
were obtained from boring, more assistance
would be forthcoming from the same source.
But unless the co. can report something
better in the future than it has in the past
there is a strong likelihood of the Com-
monwealth authorities frowning on any re-
quest for further financial assistance. Mean-
while, reports of “favorable structures,”
“bitumen occurrences,” “traces in the bore”
and “globules of oil” are again being put in
circulation.

To date the migratory Golden Butterfly
has spent nearly £lOO,OOO, mostly in flits
from field to field in the West, and now it has
only £lOOO or so and a small assorted bundle
of shypoo scrip in other cos. It has tried
more show's than any other mining co. at
presented listed on ’Change, and is probably
the unluckiest of the lot. Most of its capi-
tal, however, has been foolishly frittered
away in rushing in where more cautious
option-seekers rightly feared to tread. A
little hesitancy in this respect wmuld have
saved it a lot of money.

Yallourn escaped from the ravages of the

When the old diggers left the lead at
Eldorado (Vic.) they thought they had
scooped most of the gold out of the deep
ground. But Cocks Pioneer in the shallow
washes swept up such a lot of gold and tin
that it was bent on trying its luck lower
down the gutter. The boring w-’ent well, but
as paddocks have been cleaned up by the
plant it has been proved once more that
reliance on preliminary sampling of deep
leads by surface bores must rest on a chess-
board examination, which the wash did not
get. Mine results have been low, but scout
bores ahead of the dredge buck up Collins
House. One went 10s. to the c. _ yd-, but
preference is given to a less speculative result
of 13id. Manager Falconer thinks it to be
a reasonable result, and as better wash is
showing in the face things are looking up.

The prospectus of Chilian Oil Fields
(South America), Ltd. (reviewed L.
8/10/’25), was surely compiled by the star
writer of the Daily Bloodstain. It opens
with this preface :
This is a specimen copy of the first edition of
this prospectus, which consists of 50,000 exactly
similar copies. In the make-up of the whole edition,
including envelopes, seven tons of paper were use><.
The surface area of this quantity of paper is approxi-
mately 2,400,000 square feet—being equal to over
250,000 square yards, or 50 acres in extent. The
total number of words contained in the 50,000 copies,
collectively, is well over 1,700,000,000. These words
if placed end to end, would reach over a distance of
50,000,000 feet, which is equal to 17,000,000 yards,
or well over 8000 miles —more than twice the distance
it is from Perth to Brisbane..... An exceptional
novelty of artistic design.. . . Keep it always, read
it often, and profit bv reading it every time you
read it, is the good and sound advice of the pub-
lishers.
It has pictures and sketches and maps; and
no murder or sob-sister story ever got more
black type and big headings. However, Chile
has yet to achieve fame among the oil pro-
ducers, and South America is a long way ofE.

Junction North shareholders have poured
the cash in so often that at one annual meet-
ing a facetious callpayer suggested that the
show be re-christened the “Sink Corpora-
tion.” A couple of months ago affairs bright-
ened : the dividend stage was resumed after
six years’ absence; shares ran up to 13s.
and Pitt-street began to talk about 80s.
Then the drought set in, water trouble fol-
lowed, and the earth moved between the
1100 ft. and 1200 ft. levels. Persistent offers
to sell at Bs. fail to find buyers.

Amalgamated Zinc market at 31s. reads like,
money from home. The gorgeous price has
been achieved by the proposal to distribute
its holding of 300,000 Electro Zincs on a
three-for-five basis, thus reducing the face
value of Amalgamateds to Bs. The distribu-
tion means 225. lid. a share in face values
credited to holders, the new Amalgamated
being in half a million Bs. shares instead of
the same number at 20s. Electros are worth
about 375. The sanction of the Supreme
Court will be necessary.

“Nitros” foresees some difficulties
The Nuske Power Fuel and Nitrogen Co., which
proposes to introduce the manufacture of nitrogen
compounds from the N.S.W. atmosphere, will start
under economic disadvantages, and already a
subsidy is hinted at. This country’s nitrogen re-
quirements in the shape of nitrates and ammonium
sulphate are small compared with those of phosphatic
fertilisers, and the Chilian interests meet the demand.
With power that is certainly pot cheap, and enormous
labor costs (the co. talks of 3000 hands and a tenfold
extension of operations), the highly technical and com-
plicated electrical combination of nitrogen and oxygen
will not necessarily mean cheap nitric acid or nitrates.
Should the enterprise receive support as a possible
supplier of nitric acid for future war requirements, it
must not be forgotten that we have no highly
organised coal-tar or toluene products industry to
go with it, and thousands of tons of nitrates without
a corresponding quantity of toluene, glycerin, cotton,
methyl-aniline, etc., would make very little h.-e.
The fixation of nitrogen is a commercial success in
some countries, notably Germany and Scandinavia,
where cheap power is really cheap, but notwithstand-
ing that, the ammonium sulphate and Chilian nitrate
industries are still in a very flourishing condition.
Unless the co. has in mind an enormous campaign of,
say, rabbit extermination by the use of calcium
cyanide, it is difficult to see markets for its products.
It is not so long since a somewhat similar proposal
for Victoria vanished into thinner air than the
medium from which it intended manufacturing. How-
ever, Australia is ready to listen to big schemes,
no matter how fantastic, especially when a wages bill
of nearly a million annually is hinted at.

Mt. Isa developments continue to be satis-
factory. Good rains fell last week, and the
Leichhardt is running its usual wet-season
race. Arrangements for railway construc-
tion are proceeding; Frank Hambridge, who
is a candidate for a seat on the board, on
his return from Brisbane last week stated
that he received an authoritative assurance
there that the construction gang would be at
work in May.
Prospecting work on the New Coonambula
holdings near Mundubbera (Q.) has not
revealed anything startling, although numer-
ous crops of mineral-bearing formations have
been opened up to shallow depths. A trial
lot of four tons gave the promising assay of
lloz. gold, 2oz. silver and 11 p.c. copper,
but this was picked ore, and the average
values are much lower, probably about lOdwt.
In one shaft GOft. deep a 4ft. lode is exposed
assaying from 2dwt. to 17dwt. gold, and from
nil up to 9 p.c. copper. As the shoots appear
to be lens-shaped, there is apparently nothing
so far to handle beyond what gougers could
safely accomplish in handpicking the richest
shoots. Geologist Reid’s opinion is that
the country is largely impregnated with gold
and copper showings, blit it is very doubtful
if there has been concentration enough to
furnish payable deposits of any note.^
Alluvial Tin (F.M.S.), whose £20,000 of
paid capital has been given a value of
£480,000 on ’Change, is still active in the
flotation business. The latest offshoot is the
Kampong Lanjut, an area “lying to the north
of Malim Nawar South, Kuala Kainpar, and
Tanjong Tualang properties.’’ It is divided
from them by the Kampar Canal, and its 700
acres are estimated by J. M. Newman at
71,000,000 yards of 12oz. ground. Two
bucket-dredges are spoken of, each with
180,000 yards monthly capacity, and 50 tons
a month from each plant should, says New-
man, leave a margin of £ll,OOO with tin at
£250. In order to achieve all this, the co.
suggests £250,000 of capital in 20s. shares, of
which £230,000 will be issued. Only 132,000,
however, will be contribs., the other 98,000
being fully-paids. Alluvial Tin will receive
05.000 of these, and also £21,000 in cash, of
which £15,000 will go “to reimburse pros,-
pecting exes.,” and £6OOO in connection with
land purchases. The public, even on those
figures, will not be let into it—at present.
The 20,000 Alluvial Tins have been requested
to provide £40,000. Any of that number not
taken up will be subscribed by the directors
and, staff, who will also absorb the 82,000
contribs. not otherwise provided for. Further
details have filtered through to Sydney con
earning Changkat, the other recent float,
The co. was registered at Selangor early in
December, and is described as being “lower
down the Kinta Valley, about four miles
from Malim Nawar South.” The £71,000 of
subscribed capital is judged sufficient to equip
a 180.000 yards bucket-dredge, for which a
contract was let in November at nine months’
delivery. The degree of accessibility is
admittedly a factor necessitating large de-
velopmental expenditure. Consequently the
balance of 15s. a share on the 71,(MM) contribs.
will be got in by medium of ss. calls on the
first of March, May and July. Looked at
from every angle, the 49,000 paids in a capi-
tal of £120,000 is a big cut.
* * * *
Kundang (F.M.S.), an offshoot of Allu-
vial Tin and Ratrut, has taken steps to
create 8333 new shares. Of these 3333 will
be issued at 12s. premium, raising capital to
£125,000, and 50()0 will be held in reserve.
The extra capital will be utilised for acquisi-
tion of additional areas and completion of
the dredge, now announced as likely to com-
mence earth-eating in May. The co. lias 644
acres in Selangor, taken after three boring
tests. The first, by C. C. W. Liddelow and
Mungo Park, tested 416 acres to an average
depth of 34 feet, and estimated 23,113,000
yards going slightly under 12oz. Next, Sime
Darby and co. bored 304 holes over 340 acres,
giving pound ground for 17,000.000 yards.
.T. M. Newman followed with 154 holes over
400 acres, and estimated that 12oz. should be
the minimum average for 20,000,000 yards.
J. M. White, of the Malaya Corp.’s field
staff, confirmed this.
* * * *
Liquidation of Malaya Tin Corp. (F.M.S.)
has progressed to the stage where surrenders
of scrip to the liquidators, C. H. Kerry and
Kdvv. Edwards, will be met by a hand-out
of 50 Takuapas and 15 Ratruts to the hun-
dred. Later on a cash distribution will mop
ui» anv remaining balance.
* * * *
Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.) now controls an
area of 823 acres, inclusive of the 180 acres
of rubber-lands tested and purchased from
the Tanjong Malim Rubber Estate. Of the
total area about 50 acres have been worked
out, and 223 acres still remain to be tested.
The new dredge, when placed in commission,
will dig to 60ft. in depth and treat a mini-
mum of 130,000 yards a month.
* * *
Chairman J. S. Meagher, of Tongkah
Compound (F.M.S.), was optimistic at the
annual meeting. He told holders that there
were surplus liquid assets of £41,918, which
did not include the 40.657 shares in the No.
2 co., on which dividends were being paid
regularly, and which at present market value
were worth in the aggregate double the
amount of £24,965 at which they appeared in
the balance-sheet. The mine property, valued
at a modest £27,853, could be realised at
more than double that figure. Total cost
of the new plant would not exceed £56,000,
and the 151,000 holders of 9s. Bd. scrip in the
co. should be on a good wicket when it starts
to talk.
* * * *
Takuapa (Siam) has emphasised its belief
in a second dredge by calling tenders for
another 150,000-yards-a-month plant of the
latest bucket type, to be electrically driven.
The necessary finance will be arranged by
issuing the 35,000 reserve shares, bringing
the register to 250,000. Allocations from
current profits will supplement the share
issue, of which present holders will be
entitled to 16 per 100, at a premium of 55..
which will be paid on application, and a
like sum on allotment. The remaining 15s.
will be spread over a year. Having an un-
usually large area, Takuapa looks a more
enticing spec, with two dredges, especially
as the prospect of recovering 60 tons in a
nioiith with No. 1 dredge looks more remote
than ev_r. Various deductions from the
working time brought the February yield
down to 32 tons.
* * * *
Alexander Reefs, Grey Valley (M.L.), is.
proving a nice proposition for the 10 prospec-
tors who are working on it. Of an average
width of 6ft., the reef carries good values.
A five-stamp battery is in use. Last year
this little show, which was discovered by the
McVicar brothers, of Waiuta, crushed 705
tons for 1870 oz. fine by amalgamation only;,
it is reckoned that another £3OOO can be
got from the tailings. First crushing for
1926 was 24Soz. from 92 tons for 15 days.

“Ricardo” : In the good old pre-war days
when pints were pints, and the pubs kept
open till near midnight, I met a young Gipps-
lander in a Melbourne hotel where he was
engaged demonstrating (for a small side
wager) that it is quite easy to drink a pint
of beer without drawing breath. His method
was to absorb the contents by simply opening
his mouth and tilting the mug slowly until
it was upside-down, and an admiring friend
mentioned that he had already performed the
feat 28 times that evening. Dave showed
the modesty of a true hero when acknow-
ledging congratulations on his skill. “I’m
not a patch on me old man,” he said. “You
orter see him !” I heard later that Dave’s
tally for the night was 39 pints. He had a
bad head next morning, which he attributed
to smoking too many cigarettes.
“Machete”: The superior ferocity of the
female of the species was illustrated in a
Sydney police-court when a sorely-battered
constable proceeded against a slim young lady
of 19 summers for assault. The constable,
it transpired, was arresting a gentleman
friend of the damsel when she butted into
the argument with a bottle. The prisoner
bolted ; the John Hop, regardless of his in
juries, pursued; and the lady, like another
Ruth, went with him, hanging on and punch-
ing him “for 130 'yards.” Then aid came,
and the quarry was recaptured. The
bandaged-up prosecutor said that his assail-
ant (Marjorie was her flower-like name)
was quite sober, and no doubt wondered, with
his auditors, what form she w 7 as capable of
when otherwise. Marjorie got off with a
three-pound fine.
“The Rumpus” : In the early days of the
W.A. goldfields, a.s “Knalpi” says (B.
11/2/’2O), blackfellows w r ere mostly willing
to hand over pellets of gold, if they happened
to be in possession of any, for oddments in
rations. Which reminds me of w 7 hat Charlie
Cuthbert missed when he was a running
guard on the railway at Southern Cross. One,
day a handful of cadging niggers came to
his back door and departed with as much
tea, sugar and flour as the owner could spare.
When leaving they followed the newly-made
rut of the baker’s cart, and one abo. spotted
a little slug. He held it up and shouted to
Charlie, who ran out to investigate. Unfor-
tunately for him, his nearest neighbor also
heard the cry, and he, too, bolted for the
scene, the race ending in a dead-heat. Charlie
certainly got the little slug, but his neighbor
commenced pegging the claim, and Charlie
was bluffed in the argument that ensued.
“You ain’t got no miner’s right,” declared
the other. “I know 7 you—you’re a railway
guard.” The rich streak of alluvial panned
out roughly at £30,000. Charlie still helps
to run the Westralian railways.

“Kopai”: Cairns (Q.) has been slightly
upset by the discovery that numerous petty-
court oaths have been sworn on a copy of
“Human Diseases” instead of a Bible. An
official investigation disclosed the further
cheerful (or outrageous) fact that in the
same court a Christian had been accidentally
sworn on the Koran. Which reminds me
that in a southern Victorian watch-house a
dictionary took the place of a Bible for years.
It was a pure accident to begin with, but
later the idea appealed to the humor of. a
freethinking John Dunn, and he allowed wit-
nesses to continue unenlightened about the
book they were kissing. And I suppose as
long as they thought it w 7 as a Bible the oath

put a few leading questions, and learned
that the kid had a sick mother, and had
been sent to ask her grandmother to come
and lend a hand. The story touched him,
and he escorted- the penniless one to George-
street and put her into a Hyde tram, with a
shilling for expenses. He was thinking sadly
of the pore child when a client arrived and
breathlessly apologised for lateness, hav-
ing met a poor little girl who was try-
ing to walk right out to Coogee. She had a
sick mother, etc., etc. Two days later the
tooth-tinker saw the same girl deep
in conversation with a man in King-street,
and as soon as she had been duly placed on
a tram he had a few words with the fare-
provider. “Walking all the way to Long
Bay,” said the latest victim indignantly, “a
small child like that!” “It’s where she’ll
end up, some day,” growled the disillusioned
dentist. “I’ll wager she’s spending your
shilling in ice-cream.”

“Caul Boy”: The Yic. Cremation Society,"
which is far from satisfied with the facilities
provided at the Spring Vale depot, proposes
that the crematorium to be erected at Fawk-
ner (it will cost £7000) shall combine hy-
gienic methods with beautiful surroundings.
It is to be hoped that the society will not
go to U.S.A. for guidance. Melbourne artist
Charles Nuttall relates his experiences at an
up-to-the-minute burning ghat outside New
York, where he assisted to immolate a brother
pressman. The coffin was lowered from the
roof into a realistic representation of hell-
fire, through a square hole in the floor. When
the coffin had disappeared a slab of mother
earth rose up and filled the orifice; on it
green grass rioted over a grave-mound on
which real daisies and yellow buttercups
waved in an artificially-created breeze. The
spectacle moved many Americans present to
floods of tears. They are an emotional
people.

“Herodot” : Is “Desist” serious in suggest-
ing that the characteristic loops and whorls
of a man’s finger-prints can be removed by
rubbing the tips of the fingers with a brick
(B. 25/2/’26) ? The ridges which form the
distinctive patterns of the prints are in the
lower skin, so it would be necessary to
rub the fingers. until they were raw _ and
bleeding—and utterly unfit for professional
operations. The underworld has tried various
methods, but none of them has been found
reliable. The thin rubber gloves worn by
surgeons were popular until one leading
member of the craft got five years through his
pair tearing without his noticing it. A
Spartan method of overcoming the risk from
prints was that taken by a crook who burned
the skin completely off his finger-tips with
lunar caustic, or silver nitrate. The trouble
was that the smooth marks which he made
with his printless fingers were a good deal
more distinctive than were his actual prints,
and were soon known to every police head-
quarters in the Commonwealth.

“Ah Gee”: The extraction of nitrogen
from the air on any Large scale could hardly
have the effect of making the weather wetter,
as “J.E.” (B. 25/2/’26) suggests. Actually
it would increase the proportion of the other
constituent in the atmosphere, oxygen.
Lienee, humans would mature and live
quicker and die younger; everything would
become dryer, hotter and faster, and eventu-
allv the world would spontaneously burst
into flame. Sir Wiiliam Crookes some 25
years ago made a prophecy to this effect, and
someone else wrote an entertaining yarn
based on the idea.

“Copabella”: Speaking of quaint place-
names, Nimitybelle, in Southern Monaro
(N.S.W.), deserves a line. Some of the local
philologists derive it from Nimitti-Bel, the
great wall built by Nebuchadnezzar, arguing
that an a"ho. word could hardly resemble the

pioneer would have hit on the idea of put-

“ILK.” : The accuracy of the inscriptions
on some of Sydney’s historical relics is open
to grave doubt. It is problematical whether
the Sirius gun in Macquarie-place ever be-
longed to that ship. The vessel was com-
missioned in 1786; in December of that year
she received her guns at Longreach, on the
Thames. The foundry date on the Macquarie-
place cannon is 1788. The gun was for many
years at the lighthouse at South Head; it
was moved to its present position in 1907.
when the alleged Sirius anchor was placed
there. A brass plate sets forth: “This gun.
which formed portion of the armament of
the 11.M.5. Sirius, the first man-of-war to
enter Port Jackson, w 7 as landed shortly after
the foundation of the Colony for signalling
arrivals.” Even if the gun came from the
Sirius, that was not the first man-of-war to
enter Port Jackson —the H.M.S. Supply
anchored in Sydney Cove a day sooner —nor
was the gun landed at Macquarie-place for
signalling purposes, though it was used there-
for at South Head.

TWO POPES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Pope, giving an audience to M. Worth, said
that woman’s beauty was given to her to be cherished
as a,precious flower. Her dress should cover this
beauty and not take away its veil of mystery and
poetry. M. Worth, momentarily abashed, replied,
‘lt is custom that makes fashions. We tailors merely
follow fashion.’ ”
The garb you wear, my Ermyntrude, should be—
Hear the pronouncement from St. Peter’s throne —
A veil of mystery and poetry,
A pretty phrase enough, one needs must own.
Mystery—such as lurks about the dough
The treasures of a mutton-pie that screens—
And poetry!—no end of verse I know
(lives but the faintest hint of what it means.
Only, with such a blend, there might be dearth
Of business for chaps like M. Worth.
I hardly think, my dear, you’d pass the test
If Pius, ’leventh of his saintly line,
Should delegate some envoy to invest-
igate conditions in the surfing line.
To simulate a mystery in what
Your dainty bathers hold would be in vain;
The poetry in your beach costume is not
The highbrow article —but pikestaff-plain.
And nothing more becoming e’er had birth
(Believe me) in the brain of M. Worth.
My precious flower, were 3'ou to bloom unseen
How should I gauge your exquisiteness, how ?
You might have done it once in crinoline
Or with a birdcage—but you couldn't now.
Pope after Pope may bide his little hour
And Sultani follow Saladin, but who’ll
Set in the balance spiritual power
Against inexorable Fashion’s rule?
Quickly it brought him down from Heav’n to earth,
He got his oar in, too, did M. Worth.

“Sir Basil Clarke, speaking in London, told the Society of Arts that overseas settlement propaganda in Britain should be lifted to a higher plane by
anneal to the individual’s patriotism, as well as to his self “interest. A battalion of soldiers going abroad created more fuss than a boatload of migrants leaving
their homes for ever. Migrants were allowed to sneak out unwept, unhonored and unsung.”

“Wang” : Hollywood would be hard pushed
to film a more exciting stunt than was wit-
nessed by some spectators on Yarra Bank
one recent hot evening. A small car,
with dazzling lights, slithered down a
street leading to a footbridge wdiicli is blocked
against vehicular traffic. Shouts warned the
motorists —there were either two or three of
them —of their danger, but they sped on re-
gardless and smashed the red-gum posts to
matchwood. The car streaked across the
bridge with just four inches of space on
either side, incidentally stripping off some
wire-netting and forcing two smalL boys
to scale the handrail and hang on by

ing posts at the far end. burst through a
corrugated-iron gate further on and dis-
appeared up the hill into Studley Park.
There the joy-riders turned to the left in-
stead of the right, and rattled down a hill
and over a cliff into the Yarra, 150 feet
below. One of them jumped clear and,
escaping with a few cuts, breathlessly
announced that he was going to seek assist-
ance. Nothing lias been seen or heard of
him since. What became of the other or
others is enveloped in equal mystery. The
car-—stolen, of course—has been fished out
of the Yarra, but the corpses haven’t.

the township of Mount Pleasant (S.A.) on
February 14 a telephone operator stuck to
NOT THAT FOND OF GRACE.

lier job, though many buildings were burn-
ing all around her. The Anglican church
was damaged, the rectory was gutted, the
Bank of Adelaide (only a few hundred feet
from the exchange) and several houses were
enveloped in flames. But the plucky opera-
tor took and delivered messages until the
danger was passed, helping thereby to save
property and possibly life. “Frightened? I
don’t think so,” she said to a questioner.
“Someone hhd to be there!”

“Kir”: The first execution in Australia
took place 13S years ago, on March (>, 17SS,
the Law's victim being 17-year-old James
Barrett, who had been convicted of theft. In
the early days of N. S. Wales the gallows
were improvised wherever they happened to
be required, but Pincligut and lower George-
street were favorite places. In 1804 they
stood on Gallows Hill, but in the same year
were removed to the corner of Castlereagh
and Park streets, where the Barley Mow
Hotel is nowadays.
“X.D.” : An out-
size in mean men
has been fined £25
and ordered to pay
£lO compensation
to the keeper of a
cafe in Bourke-
street (Melbourne).
It was shown that
on two days he was
given lunch dockets
for 2s. and 2s. 7d.
respectively, and
had presented on
each occasion a slip
for 6d. Suspicions
having been
aroused, a ’tec was
called in and the
cheap feeder was
watched a n d
'caught. The pro-
p rie t o r asserted
that the delinquent
had been calling for
lunch almost daily
for eight months,
and he estimated
that he had been
chiselled out of £l5
or £2O by his cus-
tomer’s methods. It
was ju s t plain
miserliness, for,
according to the
sleuth’s evidence,
the man was quite
well off. and offered
to pay £2O to
square the matter
when he was found out.

“Ibn el Issar” : Sydney has been indulging
in the annual outcry against the wearing of
woollen clothing by men in hot weather.
People have been urging each other in the
press, as they do whenever the mercury
tops 100, to throw aside convention and rush
into “cool, white linen.” But few practise
what so many preach, and with good reason.
Actually, the coolness of white linen- goes no
further than its appearance. It must be
starched to look tidy, and health demands
that silk or woollen underclothes be worn.
It is as impervious to body-lieat as armor-
plate, and its wearer stews gently in his own
juices, like a crab cooking in its shell. In hot,
dry climates the problem of keeping cool is
solved by putting on more clothes, instead
of taking them off. That is how the Arab
and the North African have countered the
flaming heat of their desert lands. Their
garments are many and voluminous, but they
are invariably loose. Till the Australian
business man can reconcile himself to going
about in half a dozen cotton or silk night-
gowns, with a brightly-colored galabich to
top off with, he had better stick to his
woollen clothes. They let the heat out, at
any rate, which is more than linen or khaki
will do.

“11.J.W.” : The young bloods of our River
Murray ( S.A.) township decided to give a
dance—not the ordinary hop, but a more
classy affair for invited guests only. The
committee duly picked those whom it re-
garded as worthy of the honor, somewhat
pointedly excluding “Snuffler,” a local gallant
who had rendered himself distinctly unpopu-
lar by his repeated assertions that he was the
best dancer in the district, and who made a
point of attending every possible festivity
within a radius of 10 miles. “We’ll put him
in his place this time,” somebody remarked,
and there was a hum of agreement as the
pen went through his name. But when the
great night arrived “Snuffler” came with it.
His arrival caused a flutter in the official
dovecot, and after a hurried consultation
amongst the committee the secretary was
told off to explain the position to “Snuffler”
—give it him straight from the shoulder, as
it were. The secretary didn’t much like the
job, but bravely took it in hand, and, corner-
ing “Snuffler,” asked him bluntly had he
received an invitation. “No,” was the prompt
reply, “I didn’t; and that’s what I want a
word with you about. I was dam' hear not
cornin’!” Then he hurried off to fill his
programme.

“Der Jong” : Philately only attracted me
once. It was at Piet Potgeiter’s Rust, in
the n.-e. Transvaal, and Plumer’s Flying
Column was taking its ease in the abandoned
dorp. Investigators, going through a hand-
some house for spies or something, fell over
a large safe, and a Q. 1.8. lieutenant who in
private life was a skilled mechanic succeeded
in opening it with a piece of bent wire. The
safe contained dozens of fat books of stamps
of all types and nationalities. The safe-
expert arrived in our lines with his arms full
of them, and asked the writer to have a look
at his whack of the spoil. The first book
was full of the old triangular Capes, and
even a tyro could see that there was some-
thing .unique there, in South African stamps,
at least. The albums disappeared, and no-
thing more was heard of them until a
Mynheer Trichardt billed the British Gov-
ernment for £20,000. He had been a senior
postal official of the Transvaal for years,
and that was the value he placed on his
vanished property. The military “collectors,”
however, were scattered among many dif-
ferent regiments, regular and irregular, and
nothing could be done save to pay up, which,
for all I know, the B.G. did. All I got out
of it was a handful of loose stamps given me
by the safe-opener as a reward for my
opinion as an amateur philatelist. The field
post-office had a dubious reputation in those
days, so I entrusted my stamps to an acquain-
tance who was returning to Australia with
his regiment, he promising to deliver them at
my address. That I never saw or heard of
him or the stamps again I regard as proof
of the depravity of human nature.

“Riwaka”: A Melbourne youth recently
found a new use for wireless. A young
woman, living in the same guest-house, defi-
nitely refused him and became engaged to
a rival; the rejected lover betook himself to
his wireless, ostensibly for consolation, actu-
ally for reprisals. Presently the girl, who
frequently spoke to her fiance on the ’phone,
found that instrument behaving queerly. She
was perpetually receiving bogus messages of
which she was quite unable to find the source.
Next she found highly-spiced stories of her
week-end trips circulating in the house, evi-
dently started by someone who possessed an
uncannily accurate knowledge of her move-
ments. Suspicion was aroused, and a fellow-
boarder, with an extensive knowledge of
’phones and wireless, made a secret inspec-
tion of the rejected lover’s set. He found,
in addition to the usual apparatus, means
for listening to an ordinary telephone con-
versation. Wires led into the ceiling and were
tapped on to those of the house ’phone. When
the listener-in returned he found a badly-
damaged set and a note giving him his choice
of leaving at once or being put into a simi-
lar state of disrepair.

“Mag”: I think it is Anthony Trollope
who somewhere propounds the great truth
that a man is never stronger than at his
weakest moments. Three hard workers from
out back blew into a south-west Queensland
town with cheques aggregating £4OO, and
camped on the outskirts. Deciding to eschew
the roses and raptures of the settlement,
they got their prog and grog direct to camp
from the storekeeper, and settled down for
a well-earned spell. For a fortnight things
went well and quietly. Then one suggested an
hour’s visit to town, and the motion was
carried unanimously. Three weeks later
they struck camp, with never a quid of the
£4OO.
* * * *
“N.K.C.” : The listening-in craze has con-
ferred at least one benefit on country school-
masters. In out-back districts, where the
average family rubs shoulders with civilisa-
tion infrequently, the correct time always
used to be a variable quantity. When I first
went wayback teaching, little Willie Hayseed
would arrive an hour late, protesting “But,
teacher, I ain’t late. It was only eight when
I left home.” I could hardly gainsay him.
as the school clock was only checked on mail-
day, and I was never sure about it my-
self. Wireless has now given the whole dis-
trict a uniform clock, and late attendance at
school is becoming refreshingly rare.
“GEE, IT'S A BIT THICK! BET IVE
GOT TO GET THROUGH IT!”
“Black Tracker”: “Teller’s” experience
(B. 25/2/’2tl) sots me recalling some of my
own. When I was at the bank counter at
Marree, Hergott Springs (S.A.), in the early
(lays I saw many a stockman ride his
horse into the building. Afghans changing
cheques and notes into gold would always
divide the latter into two heaps, English and
Australian, the former being rejected for
some mysterious reason. A sly-grog seller
would throw his greasy bag on to the counter
and with “Let’s know how much it’s worth”
make a beeline for the pub. The publican,
whose takings on the Sunday following pay-
day on the railways often reached £2OO.
would call me into the bar, make a grab at
a handful of Treasury orders and cheques,
and fairly throw them at me to exchange
for notes and cash. But the most embar-
rassing incident of all was when a slip of
a young woman from an out-back station
shyly entered, and after waiting until the
other customers had gone, whispered that her
mother had sent in some money to be banked.
Oh being asked to hand it over she became
confused and blusliingly pointed to her
bosom. “It’s in here. Mother sewed it to
my chemise so I wouldn’t lose it.” I sent
her over to the hotelkeeper's wife, who fixed
up matters.
FRUIT OF THE FALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Why, in a climate not unkind,
Are carpenters for ever toiling,
And serried ranks of houses lined,
The beauty of the landscape spoiling?
Trees would fend off the gusty flaws,
We could keep warm with fur or feather;
But dwellings spring from graver cause
Than the vagaries of the weather.
We might have been in Eden yet,
Contentedly al fresco living,
To such wild dreams as “Flat to let’’
Or “House for sale” no credence giving,
Lulled to our slumber by the bruit
The soft wind midst the leafage rouses,
Had Eve not plucked the fatal fruit
Whose terrible result was —houses 1
An apple keeps the doctor out,
But this one brought the builders in—-
A punishment, I much misdoubt,
Too sharp however grave the sin!
For mankind, losing in the fall
His. sweet simplicity confiding,
Behind the screen of roof and wall
Most guiltily went into hiding.
Now r when he spends his little hoard
To make himself a concrete shell,
A coverture of weatherboard,
Or lath and plaster citadel,
’Tis not so much himself to hold
Secure from wind and rain he laborß
As to gain shelter from the cold
Inclemency of godly neighbors.
’Tis not by any winds that run
That characters to wreck are hurled,
Nor is the very fiercest sun
Severe as a censorious world;
Yes, he has need to be afraid
And, conscious of his nasty fix,
Conceal himself behind the staid
Respectability of bricks.
Thus tripped by a Satanic lure,
Man in his sinfulness has ceased
To live at large with all the pure
And artless candor of the beast;
For Mother Eve’s misdeed is he
In small suburban prisons pent,
The landlord and the mortgagee
His everlasting punishment.

When W. W. Gay, the new Vic. Commis-
sioner of State Forests, entered on his job
the other day he found the stock-in-trade of
his department ablaze in several places. Gay
is an old and experienced fire-fighter. As a
country schoolteacher he has often had to
lay down the duster and take up the gum-

fought three days and nights to keep the
flames away from his seminary at Gembrook,
Gippsland.
E. A. MeTiernan, the Ma State’s Attorney-
Genera], who is to go to London to shake
Lang’s big stick at George Rex, is a product
of the Marist Brothers’ High School, Syd-
ney. At 16 he was a junior clerk in the.
Commonwealth public service at £4O per
annum. Attending Sydney Uni. as an even-
ing student, he graduated as a bachelor of
laws with first-class honors in 1915, a dis-
tinction he shared that year with Tom Bavin,
nowadays N.S.W. Opposition-leader. Asso-
ciate for 12 months to Justice Rich of the
Federal High Court, MeTiernan afterwards
practised at the Bar. He was president of
the Leichhardt A.L.P. at the age of 20, and
eight years later became a member of Par-
liament and a Cabinet Minister simul-
taneously. He is still only 34.
The disappearance of Labor-leader Pren-
dergast’s mo caused almost as much sensa-
tion in Vic. Assembly as the vanishing of the
late John Madden’s upper-lip adornment 12
years ago. Madden, who was Acting-Gov.
at the time, explained to a grinning audience
that his baby grandson had tugged out one
beautiful curly end, and the razor had to
do the rest. Prendy has not explained why
he removed the perky, wax-ended nose-senti-
nel which was so conspicuous a part of his
make-up. In the Assembly lounge there are
portraits of the 25 statesmen and politicians
who preceded him as Premier. Possibly he
noted that most of them were barefaced and
desired to conform to the statesmanlike
fashion.
Rack in Adelaide after a year or so of
getting in touch with the latest European

lish at Adelaide. When not interviewing
men of letters —and he travelled in countries
as far apart as Spain, Hungary and Norway
—he got busy in the interests'of the Reper-
tory Theatre of Adelaide, of which he is
chairman. A knighthood dropped rather un-
expectedly upon him during his absence.
Dr. Pigot. the Jesuit seismologist at River-
view (N.S.W.), is to have assistance in
tracking down the unwary earthquake. The
job goes to Sydney-born Robert McCarthy,
who. grounded at St. Ignatius’s, received his
final scholastic pol-
ish in the Royal
University of Ire-
land, where he
graduated with dis-
tinction. The Jesuit
course began for
McCarthy at the
order’s Jersey Col-
lege in the Channel
Islands. When that
finished, a long
European tour gave
him the opportu-
nity of studying the
latest methods in
seismologieal re-
search. He’s not

DONALD
CHARLES
CAMERON,
Digger M.H.R. for
Brisbane.
Tom Glassey, the first Labor member that
ever burst into that silent sea of pastoral
privilege that was once the Queensland Leg.
Assembly, ticked off his 82nd birthday last
month. He began the strenuous life in Ire-
land, as a weaver's picker-up, at six years, and
was a full-fledged coalminer at 13. Bunda-
berg gave him his first seat in Parliament,
and he was looked on there as a joke for a
long time —a solitary third party, with whom
neither the wool barons nor the “Brisbane
gang” would have anything to do. But he
saw his party grow in numbers till the
short-lived Dawson Ministry gave it its first
taste of office. Tom was an original mem-
ber of the Australian Senate.
The appointment of Christopher James
Parr, head of the Auckland legal firm of
Parr, Blomfield, Alexander and Burt, as
Maoriland’s High Commissioner in place of
James Allen has not occasioned enthusiastic
cheering even in his home town, which
has long been accustomed to regard political
plums as grown for its own picking. The
complaint against the new ambassador is that
he isn’t brilliant, but the Shivery Islands
haven’t had a London rep. who was even
remotely in danger of being considered bril-
liant since Seddon let Pember Reeves go to
the Big Smoke 20 years ago. Parr is a dili-
gent, high-principled, square-jawed man of
57, a Maorilandcr by birth and Scottish by
extraction. Auckland made him a mayor,
Massey made him a Minister, and George
Rex made him a knight, and none of them
has had any reason to regret it.
Showing visible signs of what he had
been through. Percy Edward Tighe, the North
Coast (N.S.W.) solicitor, was released last
week at the instance of the Court of Criminal
Appeal. Tighe and a client had struck
trouble in large quantities, but the appeal
Judges decided that the trial Judge’s sum-
ming-up was not in order, and laid it down
that a solicitor does not render himself liable
to a charge of conspiracy merely because he
does his best for a client, whatever that
client’s morals or intentions may be. Tighe
had political aspirations in his younger days,
lie opposed Massy Greene for Richmond at
the last pre-war Federal election.
Guinness, who is about to relinquish his
job as Vic. Crown Solicitor because he is
(59 and has served for 53 years as a Govern-
ment officer, has always dodged the lime-
light. He was content to advise, guide, warn,
restrain and make the best of things when
a legal plunge was taken, but pose in . public
he wouldn’t. Before the Big Disturbance he
was recommended for the Imperial Service
Order. The insignia arrived, and was sent
down to him by the Ex. of the day, but Guin-
ness told the messenger to take the thing
away. As far as is known the bauble is still
locked up in a safe at the old Treasury.
Found dead on the Port Adelaide railway
line, evidently having fallen from a train
in the dark, H. J. Clark-Nikola, who had
put some mixed experiences into his 50
years of life. He had been a herbalist, a
Doctor of Psychology (Chicago), a lecturer
on hypnotism in India, and president of a
branch of the Labor party in S.A. But his
strongest suit was spiritualism, and during
Conan Doyle’s visit he was quite in the
limelight as a “psychic” medium” at seances
in Sydney and Melbourne.
Francis Borrill Cowling, some of whose
domestic linen has been washed in the
N.S.W. Divorce Court, was one of three par-
sons—all Congregationalists—who lost their
churches for too strong advocacy of the Labor
cause a decade and a half ago. .Tock Garden,
whose living was on the North Coast, is
now the Red leader, and Tom Crawford be-
came Marrickville’s political rep. when he
ceased to be its parson. He studied for the
law, so when his expulsion from the Labor
movement for advocating conscription robbed
him of a safe seat, he was quite comfortable.
The wealthy Congregationalists who built the
Ocean-street (Woollahra) church rather
enjoyed the strong socialistic utterances
of Cowling, which made him the best-
advertised parson in Sydney, as long as he
confined himself to preaching, but when ho
helped the Labor party in its organising work
they decided that he was going too far. A
section stuck to the parson, and promised to
provide him with a new church, but their
enthusiasm petered out.
Father .Tim Walsh, who has been at
Liverpool (N.S.W.) for the last 30 years
and is one of the best-known and best-loved
clerical sports in Australia, lately had the
small handle of P.P. given him by Arch-
bishop Kelly. As it has been the padre’s
ambition for 25 years to take a trip to the
Did Dart, the Liverpool flock expressed
appreciation of his rise by making the
journey possible. Father Walsh, is a mag-
nificent rider, and his hunter is usually the
best in a district proud of its horses, His
mount won the admiration even of Kitchener.
Walsh challenged the war-lord then and
there to run him a mile along the road “for
a tenner for the good o’ the Church.” Kit-
chener reluctantly declined. He’s fond of
his dogs, too. One of the best strains of
coursing hounds in N. S. Wales has been
bred at the presbytery kennels.
“Puzzled” : Speaking of like-as-two-peas
twins, the Birrell brothers, of Adelaide, are a
source of confusion to numerous people every
week of their lives. Both are weighty men,
Fred, who is a Labor member of the State
Assembly, scaling 18! stone, while Albert goes
16J stone. The latter is the accountant for
the proprietors of the Register, which holds
anti-Labor views. Fred was accused by some
Laborites of attending Bruce’s election meet-
ing at the _ Exhibition when he should have
been speaking at an open-air meeting on be-
half of his party: of course it was his brother
who was the culprit. Later, when Bruce
addressed the business men of Adelaide at
the Liberal Club, some of the old Conserva-
tives present gaped and rubbed their eyes
when they saw the portly form of the State
Labor member for North Adelaide near the
front row. But of course that was Albert.
The pair will be 57 on August 27.
Captain James H. Watson, the new presi-
dent of the Royal Australian Historical So-
ciety (Sydney), came to Australia 63 years
ago, but had some subsequent wanderings be-
fore he helped to found the firm of Beard,
Watson and Co. It was This successful ven-
ture that enabled him to retire 25 years ago
and devote himself to his hobby of historical
research. There are few other men whose
minds are as well stored with quaint facts
about the beginnings of things in this coun-
try. An earlier enthusiasm was the volun-
teer movement. Associated with it in Eng-
land before he came to Australia, Watson
was one of its energetic supporters in Vic-
toria and N. S. Wales; hence his military
title.
The new president of the N. S. Wales A.N.A.
is J. 11. Woods, who was a member of the
association in Vic. before branches were
formed in other States. Born in Colac,
Woods grew up to take charge of one of
that town’s newspapers. He is now retired
from business, but the national enthusiasms
which have held him all his life provide him
with plenty to do.
The passing of Robert McKillop at Har-
bord (Sydney) snaps another link with the
IS9O maritime strike. McKillop was one of
the strike committee of 27. Born in Scot-
land, he entered the Labor movement on
arrival in Australia ; he helped to found the
Sydney Wharfies’ Union, organised for the
Barrier miners, and was an early president of
the Trades and Labor Council. When the
Labor Electoral League was kindled out of
the black embers of defeat in 1891, he was
one of its leaders. Seven of his strike-com-
mittee colleagues Cook, Spence, Cotton
Houghton, Nicholson, Murphy and Smith-
entered Parliament, but the nearest McKil-
lop ever got to the talk-shop was to run
Harry Levien very close for Quirindi on one
occasion. He was president of the Warrin-
gah Shire Council at the end, which came
at 70.
BERTRAM MACKENNAL, who is to
design Sydney's war memorial.
Major Norman Brearley, who has been
keeping the machines of W.A. Airways aloft,
is in Melbourne in connection with a pro-
posed extension of the civil aviation service
from Adelaide to Perth. Brearley was the first
birdman after the war to show Perth the
possibilities of flying, and no better man could
have been found. His first flights were made
from the Perth Cricket Ground, whose dan-
gerously small area was further constricted
by the electric-light wires strung around it.
He rose at this obstacle like a horseman at
a hurdle, and his heels clouted them so
smartly that the machine hung for a moment
almost stationary before it made the brilli-
ant recovery that brought a gasp of relief.
Then he announced his intention of flying
over the Esplanade and dropping a few thou-
sand envelopes, one of which was to contain
a sum of money. The wind was blowing at
66 miles an hour when he appeared in his
now almost worn-out Avro and, after stand-
ing gravely on his head, let loose his mis-
sives. Most of them came down in the
grounds of Government House, so that the
treasure hunt was a fiasco; but those early
exploits did more than anything else to keep
active in Westralia the belief that Australia
is a good land to fly in.
“Nikko”: A recent Dunedin (M.L.) wed-
ding that wakened wide interest in the ether
world was that of Frank Bell, the amateur
wireless enthusiast. Britain, North America
and Australia wirelessed congratulations,
which were duly broadcast, and then
Timaru picked up a good-luck message from
South America. Bell is the expert who estab-
lished two-way communication with G.B. and
America; he thinks nothing of saying good-
night to all the continents before he goes
to bed.
George-street, Fitzroy (Melb.), guessed
at a wedding, a funeral or a murder in
revolting circumstances when No. 90, an
undistinguished cottage with a tin roof and
the spidery ironwork-fringed verandah of a
past era, burst into life and became the
cynosure of half a dozen press cameras. The
real reason for the eruption, however, was
the Historical Society’s practice of setting
up memorial tablets on hallowed spots
throughout the State. At No. 90, on August
o, 1856, a silvery voice was heard for the
first time. It belonged to a very new infant
named Alfred Dealdn.
Samuel Johnson, who has just died in Adel-
aide at 70, was an Irishman who came to
Melbourne in 1882 as an expert in helping the
deaf and dumb. He moved across to South
Aus. in 1885, became superintendent of the
Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institution on the
seashore at Brighton, and gave the rest of his
life to it. It has been enormously increased
by wings dedicated to Barr-Smith, E. T.
Smith, Yosz, Colton and Anderson, and has
sundry branches in the State: also pupils of
Johnson’s training are at the head of similar
institutions in Melbourne and Westralia.
THIS PURPLE POLITICIAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Purple with indignation, Mr. Mutch (Minister
ror Public Instruction) launched an attack against
the s .vstern of voting under which the Government was
elected. Neither Alderman Hicks nor Alderman King
has been in Parliament, and so they know nothing
of what they are talking about,’ he said. The de-
mands proportionalism made upon the time of
members prevented them from attacking more im-
portant issues and imposed upon them a burden under
which their health was crushed.” —S. M. Herald.
Who, of the common herd, may visualise
That politician’s cross who puts away
Sordid conceits, and; full of high emprise,
Upon the altar of the State doth lay ’
His sacrifice of all that life holds dear,
Yet finds no praise for what he doth essay,
Only the crude and ill-conditioned sneer,
The dubious snort, the loud sardonic bray?
So, see him turn upon the cackling clutch,
Purple with indignation—Mr. Mutch.
Avaunt ye, critics of a passing hour
Who never have been even M’s.lj.A.,
Or known the awful majesty of Pow-er
That brooks no comment, save it be “hooray.”
Tremble, ye clods, whose cachinnatory howd—
As when the moon the vacuous bandogs bay—
Brings to the Ministerial brows a scowl,
And fills his following with a dumb dismay,
best, in his wrath, your very bones he’ll scutch,
Purple with indignation—Mr. Mutch.
Tis shocking that such fellows should dictate
Thus to their masters, doubtless led ast ray
By Bavin’s minions. All that’s out of late;
The voter’s duty is to blithely pay
What salaries their reps, themselves allot,
And then their jawing tackle to belay.
Should any protest that’s not really what
The Honorable Member meant to say,
He swears such dastard hints his honor touch,
Purple with indignation—Mr. Mutch.
Consistency, that jewel acclaimed of bards,
Is not with statesmen popular alway.
Their path is littered with the shattered shards
Of promises recorded yesterday.
The changing colors from the rainbow shed
They take for their political array ;
True Tory blue, iconoclastic red,
Orange or green, or non-committal grey.
No tint he favors, though, of any such,
Purple with indignation—Mr. Mutch.

CYANOGAS
(Calcium Cyanide)
Full particulars
promptly on
request.
STATE DISTRIBUTORS
The rabbit pest will cease to trouble you if you “clean up” your land
with Cyanogas. The Fumo Dust Blower has been designed for blow-
ing it into the warrens in a fine dust, where it gives off deadly fumes
for at least 24 hours, making complete destruction of every rabbit
certain. It indicates every opening of the warren by a dust cloud.
Though deadly to rabbits, it is quite harmless to the operator.
Mr. Leslie Capel, of Spring Plain, Kelvin, Gunnedah, writes, 17th
November, 1925: “I have to acknowledge receipt of your ‘Fumo’ Dust
Blower (Calcium Cyanide), purchased through
your local agents, Messrs. Nivisons Ltd.,
Gunnedah, and after a thorough and extensive
trial must express my complete satisfaction
with same. It is easy and economical to
work, effective, and with two men operating,
one fumigating and the other filling in
the burrows, a great deal of country can be
got over in one day. The results to date have
far exceeded my expectations, and I will be
only too pleased to recommend same to my
friends.”

ABORIGINALITIES

BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Wang”; Old Dad Hallet, who used to
live at Tip Tip, was returning home through the
bush one evening when a hollow limb, about 6ft.
long, fell from a tree under which he was passing.
It came down end on, and the next thing the old
man knew was that he had been boxed in a wooden
envelope. He tried hard to get out, but failed. It
fitted him better than a tailor-made suit, reaching
down to his ankles, and leaving just enough room
to let him hobble along. Fortunately there happened
to be a knot-hole near the top of it, opposite his
eyes, and he could thus see enough to guide him-
self. He turned around and made back to Donnelly’s
pub, which he had just left, and pushed his way
into the bar as Donnelly was setting up a round
of drinks for the boys. Donnelly let out a yell
and dropped a bottle, and the boys didn’t wait
for their drinks. A perambulating log of wood
emitting strange sounds w*as a new* and fearsome
type of jim-jam. Dad floundered about in the bar
for 10 minutes before Donnelly, having recovered
from his fright, would attempt to extricate him. He
had to get a maul and wedges to split open the
shell.
* * * *
“Slam”: We’ve all heard that Australia
is as poor in native fruits as she is rich in birds;
but it must be remembered that many of our orchard
fruits are the result of centuries of cultivation, just
as many of our present cereal crops were once wild
grasses. A good number of our indigenous fruits are
well worthy of intensive cultivation; I should like
to see the experiment made with the Queensland
wild edible fig (F. glomerata ), the jujube (already
much beloved by Central Queensland kids), the
“vegetable egg” or native marmalade of the Far
North, the splendid Queensland native plum, and the
largest of the coastal geebungs. These are now left
to the wild pigeons, parrots and swag-humping
battlers.
* * * *
“Pick”: We are slow to discover the hidden
value of Australian bush growths. The virtue con-
tained in the juice of the common bracken fern, for
example, remains to be discovered by some analyst,
and the plant, at present considered a curse, may
turn out to be a valuable commodity. Crushed up
the green fronds when rubbed upon parts affected by
the stings of venomous plants or insects affords
instant and lasting relief. An application of the
sap to face and hands is the bushman’s most effec-
tual barrage against attacks from mosquitoes or
sandflies.
* * * *
“Lavinia”: The best sheaf-stacks in Aus-
tralia are built in Southern Vic., notably about the
rich Werribee. There I once threw a ’ beautifully-
built giant of 210 tons at a chaffeutter. At lunch
I was lauding the builder. “Thank you!” said a
pretty young woman of 20. Stackmen had been
scarce that harvest, as they wqre away putting a
thatch on the German, and she had built it. “Getting
down was the hardest part,” she said. Despite the
fact that very heavy rain had fallen on it, only
the actual outer layers of hay were damaged.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: As usual, the swaggie has
been blamed for starting some of the fires that have
been raging in Victoria and N. S. Wales. The only
evidence against him is that ho
makes a fire wherever he camps.
But he is generally an experienced
bush-traveller, who is very parti-
cular about his camping places, and,
according to my observation,
always careful with fires. The
tourists and amateur campers
from towns, on the other hand,
ar e often careless and unintelli-
gent in regard to fires and camp-
ing spots. The motorist and train
passengers who throw out lighted
matches, bottles and smouldering
butts of cigars and cigarettes are
far more dangerous travellers than
the man on the wallaby. The
train also is a constant danger
where there .is dry* grass and
rubbish easily lighted by a spark
from the engine. I have seen
wheatgrowers in South Aus. stand-
ing with boughs ready while the
train passed a ripe crop, but they
had no fear of the swagman, unless
he was smoking an uncovered pipe.
Then their fury was like a sirocco.

“H. 8.” : A Wimmera( Vic.)
cocky speeded-up a few weeks ago.
He hitched a four-leaf set of har-
rows behind his Ford car one
morning, hummed out on to his
fallow’ and harrowed an 80-acre
paddock. He had his lunch at the
wheel, and his only stop was at
knock-off time. And then he
motored in to the pictures.
“Suslrn” : When trapping ringtail opossums
aiound Leake (Tas.) we often found in our
traps the rare little opossum mouse. The Lake
Country is the only part of Tasmania where I have
heard of them being found. This small animal is
the color of the ordinary mouse, but the tail and
ears are the same as the ringtail ’possum’s. Has any'
Abo. seen them on the mainland?
* * * •
“Blanc”: Concerning alleged volcanoes,
let me give a personal experience in Tingha (N.S.W.)
two years ago. A mighty, rushing rumbling, fol-
lowed by a loud crash! The whole house shook
so violently that I jumped from bed and ran out,
to find similarly disturbed neighbors also in the
street. The sergeant had his revolver, for he
thought that someone had blown open the safe of
the Government Savings Bank; the bank-manager
thought the same of his safe, and was similarly*
armed; two dredge-owners rushed to their maga-
zines, believing that an explosion of stored gelignite
had occurred ; but old hands including the bullockv
a\ ei red That w*as only* rocks out on King’s Moun-
tain tumblin’ down! They’ve been doin’ it for 50
years! They yvould have told more about these
jumping rocks, but Tingha winter nights are frigid.
As a matter of fact the excitement this night was
caused by a large meteorite falling near Gilgai, about
nine miles away.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: It is a far cry from Fiji to
the West Indies, but they are sisters in adversity
by' reason of the Indian mongoose. Both introduced
the murderous little brutes hoping to extirpate the
rats which attacked the sugar-cane, and both have
MAKING THE HOLIDAY LONGER.
MAGISTRATE: “I find both of you guilty. Have you anything to say before I sen-
tence you?”
MALE DEFENDANT: “Only, your Worship, I’d like it if you could postpone my dear wife’s
term until after I am released.”
found that he prefers to destroy the native birds
and their eggs. The mongoose has thus practically
wiped out the lalamakadrau, a Fijian bird which lived
chiefly on the Levuana moth, whose caterpillars are
the foe of the cocoar.ut. Fiji is trying to think out
a way of so dealing with the mongoose as to pre-
serve the moth-eating birds, and thus retain the
valuable service they render, and wants all the help
it can get in the campaign.
* * * *
“Parama”: While interviewing some of
the younger generation amongst the Torres Strait
islanders recently, with the idea of finding a couple
of boys to sign on for work on the lugger, I had
amusing evidence of the influence of the movies on
the native mind. One youth of about 18 gave his
name as “Two-gun Charlie,” and there wasn’t a
flicker of a smile on either his face or the faces of his
companions. Another told me jauntily that he was
“Texas Joe,” and assured me that he was a very
brave man—“all same that feller Tom Mix.” I
signed on two others with less suggestive names.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: Black Brother is admired for
the way he gets up a lofty tree by the aid of vine
and tomahawk, merely cutting a notch here and
there for his big toe. But many white men are
just as good at these ’possum stunts. Such climbers
are found oftenest in camps where gum-leaves are
obtained for eucalyptus distilleries. Branches
are lopped at a great height, and rivalry among
champions leads to some tall climbing. A leaf-getter
in the Muttama. (N.S.W.) district named Hudson
was considered a better climber than any aborigine
till a nasty fall affected his nerves. Another expert
at shinning up a tree is the well-known field natural-
ist Sid W. Jackson, who collects birds and eggs
for 11. L. White, of Belltrees, Scone (N.S.W.).
Though a bulky gentleman, lGst. in weight and
over 50 years of age, he can get up a tall sapling
without aids of any kind, and is reckoned to be the
best climber of his weight and age in the bush.
* * * #
“Up North” : Many Queensland abo. tribes
make large mesh nets out of teased fibre for emu
catching. Such a net may be 60ft. long, 6ft. high
and with meshes about lOin. by Sin. About every
10ft. is placed a sapling support stuck firmly in
the ground. Emus have a habit of using the same
track to water. The hunters wait until the bird
goes by, then stretch the net in a semi-circular shape
across their track. The emu is a casual drinker, and
generally wastes minutes titivating himself by the
water-pool. In leisurely style he retraces his
steps, but is suddenly startled by a concerted yell.
Screaming niggers are coming behind him and he
does a marathon down the track, only to butt into
the net. As he thuds back on his tail, he becomes a
target for a rain of spears. One Gulf tribe when
particularly hunger-pressed builds a lane-way of
bushes, at the far end of which is concealed a strong
net. A buck hides down the lane and imitates
perfectly the emu's love song. This is a sort of
drumming sound imitated by blowing into a hollow
bamboo tube. Any distant bird sentimentally in-
clined, hearing the seductive invitation, struts along
with quickened step. He waddles into the laneway,
his long neck craning from side to side in the
endeavor to locate the coquette. He’s just about to
do so when things begin to happen behind him.
Then love flies out of the window, and the emu
flounders into the net.
* * * *
“Buttenderry”: gome years ago O’Come-
back, a western squatter, visited a famous stud and
bought a small lot of high-class ewes and rams at
a cost of several thousand pounds. He arranged that
their late owner should give delivery to his drovers,
whom he would despatch immediately on his arrival
home. This he did. In due course the drovers
returned, but as soon as O’Comebaek saw the sheep
he realised that he had been “stung.” They were a
mediocre lot, and not by any means the treasures
he had bought and paid for. The reply to his
letter of protest was a bland assurance that the sheep
were the identical ones he had selected ; that his men
had accepted delivery, and there was nothing further
to say in the matter. O’Comeback didn’t agree. He
wrote to the effect that he intended either to get
the animals he had chosen or enter the nondescript
substitutes in the forthcoming Sydney Sheep Show,
each sheep being ticketed as bought from So-and-so
stud at such-and-such a price. He got his sheep.
“Kriz” : Though often seen in the northern
waters of the Westralian coast, the sail-fish is seldom
caught. A piece of red bunting fixed on a hook
and line thrown over the side of a pearling lugger
by a koepanger crew attracted one which had been
seen for a few days. Hauled on the deck, it was
found to be a beautiful bright blue, with brown spots
about the size of a shilling under the belly. The fin
on its back stood up like the mainsail of a schooner,
and was nearly 3ft. long and 2ft. wide. When it was
furled it fitted completely into a socket. The fish
has a beak like a huge gar’s, and a long, fine swallow-
tail.
* * * *
“Parakioroe”: There is nothing at all un-
common in “Te W.’s” discovery of rainbow trout
within tidal limits (B. 11/2/’26). On the banks of
the Tuki Tula River, Hawkes Bay (M.L.), I have
reared rainbow trout from fry to yearlings in ponds
fed by artesian wells, and season after season have
liberated the yearlings in the tidal estuary. The
young fish gradually work their way to the upper
reaches, but pay an annual visit to the sea; in fact,
QUITE READY TO BE A CANNIBAL.
PERCY : “ft truth, ’Erb, I feci like a mug of
beer!”
’ERB : “I wish yer was!”
it is common for them to be caught in the fisher-
men’s nets outside the river-bar. I have found sea-
going rainbow trout in all the M.L. rivers in which
I have fished. Even from Lake Taupo many of the
sheeny tribe take a header over Huka Palls on their
way to the ocean. The vacation seems to add lustre
to their apparel and flavor to their flesh.
(Continued on page 21f.)
WHEN THE MINE IS CLOSING DOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a rumor round the town to-night where
frightened people meet;
Small groups of men are talking all along the
winding street.
There is sudden care upon them and the tyrant worry
writes
Lines of fear across their faces as they halt beneath
the lights.
For the mine has paid their wages and the mine has
kept the town;
But the tongue cf rumor tells them that the mine
is closing down.
More than sixty years have passed us since the first
prospectors came,
Finding leads and outcrop ridges where the metal
flashed like flame;
And through years of throbbing engines, night and
day with changing shift,
Blasting, driving, stoping, searching, men have
toiled the wealth to lift.
Now the golden harvest’s failed them, and the brows
of fortune frown,
While the rumor grows more certain that the mine
is closing down.
Homes were built in times of plenty when there was
no fret of doubt
That the town would ever perish or the leads some
day work out.
Happy then were crowded pay-nights all the lighted
street along;
Happy were the days of pleasure crowned with
nights of dance and song.
But dark murmurs breaking on them come their
joy in loss to drown,
Saying there’s but one more pay-night, then the
mine is closing down.
THE BUSHMAN'S INSTINCT.
BOSS: “We’ll just fly through there when the line’s
finished, Jacky."
JACKY : “No fear, Boss. Mine tinkit have to duck it
head too much goin’ through that burrow!”
Homes are there to be forsaken, work that somewhere
must be sought;
And who knows what months of hardship to be
met and faced and fought?
Men are w r ondering what they’ll turn to, since there’s
little mining now.
Chance perhaps will send them droving, swinging axe
or driving plough;
And it’s haunting care that grips them when the
mine has kept the town
And a rumor stalks the township that the old show’s
closing down.

“The Rumpus” : While living at Harriet-
ville (Vic.) I owned a little mare that used to eat
out of a box in the paddock until the cows began
to bother her. Dolly at first lashed out with both
hind legs, but grew tired of not being able to
concentrate on her fegd, so suddenly decided on
different tactics. Gripping the box with her teeth,
she marched off a distance and put it down. Pre-
sently the cows were around her again, and off she
went with her dinner to another place. This lasted
for a little while until finally she carried the box
through the open gate to near the house, the cows
still, hungrily following her. Driven at last to despera-
THE UNREASONABLE LAW.

tion she pressed her way into the 30in. passage between
the ■ kitchen and the house, and there secured im-
munity from interference. But when she’d eaten her
fill; she stuck fast and had to wait over 10 hours
to regain her freedom. I made Dolly a stall after
that.
* * * *
“Alastor” : Some fortunes will be made out
of the shilling emu-egg bonus on Queensland prickly-
pear lands. In the Mitchell district in an infested
area a selector and his wife, with a motor, recently
broke 300 emu-eggs in three hours, giving a bonus-
value of £l5. Five men in the same district broke
2000 eggs in a. two days’ motor run, equivalent to
£ 100. Before breakfast one day last year a
selector in a dense pear-bed smashed 200 eggs. The
cocky in infested parts, such as Dulacca and Wal-
lumbilla (s.-w. Q.), has a fortune awaiting him in
the bonus offered by the Prickly-pear Lands Com-
mission.
* * » *
“Doggo” : A friend of mine Ims a sporting
dog which he thought had worms, and he heard that
arica-nut was the remedy. He purchased some from
the chemist, mixed it with butter, and, making a
a. it. _
pul, laid it on the
floor. He had been
told to open Casar’s
mouth, put the pill on
his tongue and hold his
nose, when he would
swallow it. First of
all he had to starve the
dog for 24 hours. He
tried to open Casar’s
mouth, but failed.
Then he called in the
wife to hold the brute’s
hind legs. The dog
struggled violently and
still refused to open
his mouth. Then he
brought in his son to
hold the dog’s front
legs, but still Caesar
clenched his teeth. The
assistance of. the
daughter was then
called for and she sat
on the dog. Casar re-
sented this final insult
more violently than
ever, and, bursting free,
shook himself. Then
lie walked straight
over to the pill and
ate it.
“ Henry Panni-
kin” : Dad was roaring
up the old chap he’d
engaged as a first-class
fencer. The fencing
wasn’t of the best, but
it was good compared
with the one Dad him-
self had erected, and
the other chap told him
so. “Mine ain’t crooked
like that ’un,” said
Dad. “Crooked?”
roared the fencer. “It’s
that blarsted crooked
if a dorg crawled
through it he’d come
out on the same side.”
“Hamer”: In Albury a nurseryman has
limes, oranges, lemons and mandarins growing on

and three varieties of apples on a third. But I think
the record is held by a tree in Ohio (U.S.A.) which
bears 12 different varieties of apples on as many

“FY7”: The suggestion that Queensland
householders should subsidise the local green house-
frog as a cockroach destroyer is belated. It would
be a safe bet that 75
per cent, of Queensland
homes in town and
country carry one or
more of the big fellows
on the domestic estab-
lishment. They are
exceedingly intelligent,
and soon get accus-
tomed to hum a n
society. Their stow-
age capacity for cock-
roaches is marvellous,
and they will pack
them in till the logs
and wings of late
arrivals protrude round
the big mouth like a
crop of whiskers. This
frog is a specialist
also at cleaning up
moths and insects
attracted by a table-
lamp, and his agility
in catching them and
his habit of stowing
them awy with liis
“hands” after th e v
have been nailed by
his tongue, are well
worth watching. An-
other characteristic is
hi s persistence. If,
for instance, one takes a fancy to the verandah
water-bag you must either slay him or surrender.
“G.R.S.”: My experience of dates (B.
4/'2/’2O) was got during several years spent in
Mesopotamia, where the crop is estimated at about
90,000 to 100,000 tons p.a. The palms of that
country certainly flourish near the sea. Indeed, they
do not do so well above Ali Gharbi, where they are
cultivated on only a thin strip of land along the
Tigris. Nearer the sea the banks on either side
of the river, varying from half to three-quarters of
a mile back, are devoted almost entirely to dates,
with grapes festooned from one palm to another
and figs and pomegranates planted here and there'.
The male tree is always noticeable owing to its
being half as big again as the female. Fertilising
is done by the Arab farmer taking the male bloom,
breaking it into pieces and placing the fragments
in the central stems of the female palm. The bloom
will bear without fertilising, but yields larger fruit
if so impregnated. The Arabs gather green dates,
certainly, and these ripen more or less after a time,
but they are hard. I never saw the fruit put in
sand to ripen. It always ripened naturally. Young
HE'D SHOUT FOR THE BOY, ANYWAY.
MCTAVISH : “Wot dae ye chairge for the wee laddie?”
CONDUCTOR: “Well, if he's under five it wont cost yer nothink?’
MCTAVISH: “Verra weel. He can gang along wi’ ye an’ I’ll be
walkin’."
plantations are started from suckers and not from
seed, and by this means fruit true to variety is
ensured. This would hardly be the case from seed
owing to the cross fertilising. The best varieties
are the Ivhowdhaur and Halawi.
“Bunya” : Has anyone noticed that while
the platypus is the same size and color everywhere,
its cousin the spiny anteater (echidna) is larger the
further south it is found ? The gradation is very
marked and constant, and there are other small
variations according to latitude. The Speck “hedge-
hog” is about 20in. long, the common Australian
17in., and the New Guinea just over a foot. The
last-named has only three toes instead of the usual
five, and the hair is so long as almost to conceal the
spines.
* * * * \
“H.1.M.” : In justice to Lord Apsley (B.
18/'2/’26) it may be pointed out that his “colonial”
experience was mostly in the mallee, where the
pioneering cocky is still apt to put two barbed-wires
hung on mallee-saplings around his crop-paddock till
lie can afford a netted fence. And let me put in , a
word for barbed-wire. Young stock reared inside
fences topped with a single barbed-wire at a beast's
shoulder-height (say 4ft.) will never in after-life
get caught in a fence from playing near it. I owned
one otherwise irreproachable nag which couldn’t
refrain from pawing at a fence, and I was continually
finding him anchored thereto by one wire jambed
between the heel of the shoe and the hoof. Hu
always waited patently for a rescue; but an early
introduction to barbed-wire would have prevented him
ever acquiring his fault.
* * *
“Parama”: If the ladies of the Torres
Strait islands now give the cold eye to birth-control
ideas (B. 14/l/’26), they differ greatly from their
sisters in New Guinea. The N.G. lady does not
see why she should have to bear and bring-up a
large family besides doing her other numerous jobs. She
has to do all the work connected with the “garden,”
which is always a good way from the village, and
has also to carry back-breaking loads of yams,
bananas and other vegetables home with her at the
end of each day. She then has to prepare and cook
the meals for her lord and master. She also has
to go to the bush and get the firewood to do the
cooking with. It is she who has to see to it
that the “house,” or her portion of it if she lives
in a community dwelling, is kept clean and in order.
Hers is the duty of grinding the pieces of rock
into stone adzes and axes. The making of don
(sago) is from first to last her business, and a
slow business it is. Hers is the duty to cut the
nipa-palm leaves into shape for Wall and floor
building. In any spare time she has to make grass
and fibre petticoats, plait sleeping-mats and baskets,
make nets to collect cocoanuts, the contents of
which she grates for food flavoring and from which
she extracts oil. Small wonder that she goes on
strike over the baby business. AVith her to bear
twins is a disgrace—“all same pig”—and the second
of the pair to arrive is never allowed to live, nor
is the fact of its having been born revealed to
the husband.
* * * *
“Tartarin”: For those who have never
heard of the place, it would be just as well to explain
that it is a one-eyed town in West Queensland, sur-
rounded by about 20,000 acres of prickly-pear and
infested with black snakes, brown snakes and death-
adders. On pay-nights there are snakes with blue
eyes and yellow legs. Generally, they are treated with
the utmost contempt; in fact, one resident is reported
to have never killed one except with the heel of his
boot or by cracking its head off in true stockwhip
fashion. Those who live there, however, take no
chances with the deadly adder. At night they always
carry lamps or lanterns, and shamble along with bent
heads, staring at the ground for any sign of the
quick death which may lurk round the bend or
beneath a protruding pear-stick. On one occasion
five were killed in the main street within two days,
and one under the stationmaster’s dining-table. The
hotelkeeper reassured me by saying that he had
killed only two in his back yard during the whole
summer! Couples who take an evening stroll are
well chaperoned by lamps, and after half an hour
or so you may hear a fond mother calling: “Maggie!
Come in out of the snakes.”
* * * *
“Km”: For the purpose of breaking up
the monopoly which Japanese divers have in the
pearl-fisheries of Broome, the Pearlers’ Association
has adopted a scheme for importing young Chinese,
sending them out on a training lugger in charge
of an expert, and turning them into skilled men.
A levy of £2O per boat owned and operated by
members provided a financial basis for the scheme.
At the end of the season the trained men were to
be balloted for to work as divers on the winners’
stations. The report of the man in charge of the
bigger, lately discussed by the association, shows that
in a year’s operations £95 worth of baroque and
3 tons sewt. of shell were fished, and that four
of the men showed promise of becoming first-class
divers. The association has decided to continue the
training scheme till April next, when the position
will be reviewed ; if it is not then more satisfactory
than it proved last year, it will be abandoned. Never-
theless, seeing that many engine-pump boats with a
skilled diver aboard fished only 5 tons last year,
31 tons is not bad for unskilled men.
* * * *
“Vani-koro” : When he gets back to Den-
mark, Dr. Schmidt, perhaps the world’s greatest
authority on eels, who lately passed through Aus-
tralia on his way to Tahiti, hopes to arrange for
a research vessel to visit the Pacific to study the
migrations and breeding habits of the eels of that
region in the way that has been clone in the Atlantic.
From a study of the evidence now available, Dr.
Schmidt is inclined to think that the eels found
in the fresh waters of eastern Australia and Tasmania
breed in the deep sea to the north of Lord Howe
or Norfolk Island. His theory is that the eel was
originally an inhabitant of the deep seas of the
tropics, and that the search for food, or other
cause, led it to take to entering fresh waters, though
it still returns to its original habitat to breed. A
few species of eels find their way into the temperate
regions, and even beyond. In the Southern Hemi-
sphere eels do not seem to go farther south than the
Auckland Islands ; but the American species is found
in Greenland, and the European in Iceland, northern
Norway and the rivers running into the White Sea.
If the Australian eels breed away to the eastward, it
would help to account for the fact —if it be a fact —
that eels rarely reach the Murray or other streams
THOSE SIMPLE HOME REMEDIES.
FIRST LOST SOUL: “Gripes, I'ye got the
hiccups!”
SECOND DO.: “ ’Arc yer tried puttin' a cold
kcy down your bach?"
in South Aus. except those in the extreme south-
east, and that with one exception there are practically
no eels from there on round the southern, western and
northern coasts of Australia as far as the Gulf of
Carpentaria. The exception are the eels found near
Roebuck Bay, in the north-west of W,A. ; but these
are of an Indian Ocean species, found on the islands
and coasts of that ocean, and quite distinct from the
eels of eastern Australia.

+ ICI i C^aims may be the means of restoring
youth to aged people.”
Along the wave-washed golden sand
1 went my idle way
To watch the breakers kiss the land
And hear the children play.
Within a cool, secluded spot
I saw a maiden fair
Who seemed by all the world forgot,
She looked so lonesome there.
She watched a pram with loving care
Drawn up beside her seat;
A child with clouds of golden hair
Played with his dimpled feet.
Yet he had such a wise old air
Beneath his childish mask
That I, who longed this shade to share,
Turned to the maid to ask:
“AVho is this child with hair of gold
And eyes of wondrous blue,
That is so young yet looks so old
And smiles so archly, too?”
She stooped to fix the canopy
Above the little bed,
Then turned her violet eyes on me,
■ And this is what she said:
“Poor grandad was threescore and ten,
And age had got him down,
Though with a stick he now and then
Would hobble up the town.
“Well, grandad bought a drug one day
From someone in the street;
It was to chase old-age away
And bring him tireless feet.
“A teaspoonful each night, no more—
That’s what the peddler said —
Would all his long-lost youth restore,
Grow hair upon his head.
“But grandad had his doubts about
The strength of any drug,
So took the metal stopper out
And filled the kitchen jug.
“He drank the mixture on the spot
To see what it would do ;
And there he lies, his pipe forgot,
And his rheumatics, too.”

STOCKINGS
Australia has been discovered artistically
all over again. These discoveries have been
frequent during the last few years, thanks
to. Strecton, Lambert, Longstaff and others ;
and now sculptor Bertram Mackennal is
hymning to the natives —who, of course,
would never have discerned it for themselves
—the beauty of the land from which he has
strayed, prosperously enough, for 25 years.
It is as quaint a situation as when the Bel-
gian Verbrugglien used to impress on his
Australian listeners the merits of Sliaks-
peare. Mackennal is to create the soldier
memorial that is to grace Martin-place—a
matter for which every lover of line should
lift a hosanna. For the prosy declaimer of
the obvious is a poet in stone.
Since their arrival the sculptor and his
lady have been caught in a maelstrom of wel-
come. At the Town Hall affair the voice of
Lud Mayor Stokes was as the cooing dove,
and artists were as thick as bees. The In-
stitute of Journalists and the Millions Club
spread lunches whereat Bertram voiced his
belated enthusiasm—so excitedly that his
words were audible quite a foot away from
his lips.
In a week of social slackness the opening
of the water-color show was the stirring
event. The Best Knowns (who, as the girl
in the flat opposite says, are never the Too
Well Knowns) and everybody, including
Feminists and Solomon Islanders, turned up
at the Education Department’s door and were
safely deposited on the fifth floor. Knight
Bertram Mackennal had been lured to do
the opening, and this he performed neatly
and with despatch, not waiting for the usual
plauditory preface. Thereat president B. E.
Minns, who had the necessary hints pencilled
on liis shirt-cuff, smiled like a seraph, for
he is by nature a man of few words. Some-
thing was atmospherically right for the sculp-
tor, and this time he charmed alike the ear and
the heart of the listener. And his lady
looked very graceful in straight-falling black
georgettes, pink-rose-patterned like an
old-fashioned cretonne. Her hat was wide,
black and velvet-trimmed, and wherever she
went also went her presentation armful of
mauve asters and pink roses. The society’s sec-
retary, Gladys Owen, sported a currant-red
scuttle hat with a pale expression ; but her
words (of course she made a speech) were
as full of color as her Cronulla Beach.
Repertorians intoxicated with Pekoe dis-
cussed the new drama and a higher form
of humor as an interlude to admiring the
works, on the walls. Among this group were
Beatrice Tildesley, Thea Proctor and Albert
Collins. John Banks, whose “Beach Decora-
tion ’ is one of the most sensitive pieces of
work in the show, made jokes about golf.
Ethel Turner Curlewis was there with daugh-
ter Mrs. Charlton, the latter swathed to her
ears in a pink tulle scarf and looking pre-
cisely like one of her mother’s heroines. Mrs.
Minns, among other raiment, wore long ear-
rings and a small hat that must have burst
asunder if half the compliments about her
husband’s work had reached her. Veteran
Henry Fullwood was another who ate at the
tea-tables presided over in the interests of
the Red Cross by the Maearthur Onslow
chick and a group of young things. Newly-
returned Judge Hamilton squired doettir-
daughter Marie, and medicine-woman Con-
stance D’Arcy smiled above an appendix
necklet —at least one appendix operation
must have gone to the buying of the dainty
trifle. Airs. Lyster Ormsby brought sister
Airs. Gerald Hobbs, just fresh from Gavutu
strands, and with them was another dame
from the Solomon Islands, Mrs. Ivnibbs.
Poetess Dorothea Alackellar. Barnardo-
enthusiast Ruth Beale and Airs. England
were others who patterned the afternoon •
and grace was added to the platform bv the
presence of Ruby Adams and Airs. Lachlan
Beaton.
The women water-colorists, incidentally,
more than hold their own. Very striking
was the work of Aland Sherwood, a Afaori-
lander who has studied in Europe, and is
about to return there. A’ida Lahey, a’ Queens-
lander, makes a strong appeal,' as also do
Gladys Owen and Adelaide Terry a former
Melburnian.
Another job for Bertram was mentioned
at the Adams Cafe sliivoo with which the
A.N.A. wound up its conference. At the
instance of the Newcastle branch, the A.N.A.
is collecting funds for a statue of Henry
Kendall, and the idea is to get Mackennal
to do it. Incidentally, some warm remarks
were made about the fact that, while Scotch-
men had put up effigies of Burns in Aus-
tralian capitals, the poets of Australia had
been neglected.
A. C. Willis, leader of the Leg. Council
which refuses to perish, had something plea-
santer on his mind than political worries
last Saturday, for son Cyril was married
at Bexley to Eileen Monica Sargent, of
Ivogarah. The Willises are Welsh, wliateffer.
Sydney was shocked again last week at
the news of the death of another traveller
who had set off gaily enough a few weeks
before on the Drama. This time the cable
reported the death of Mrs. Geoffrey Fairfax,
wife of the director of the S. M. Herald.
Mrs. Fairfax, who was a daughter of the
late Captain Hixson, R.N., was acclaimed
one of the Sydney belles of her day.
Friday was Soldiers’ Day, so Sydney dug
into its pockets and bought the useful and
the useless, just as they happened to the
hand of the stallholder. Collection-boxes to-
wards noon began to have a replete sound;
and the little stronghold of Marie Burke,
which bloomed with many another in
Martin-place, had a prematurely bald appear-
ance about 3 o'clock. Everybody sported
a button, and a blue bird flew upside down
with tipsy dignity across Martin-place. It
leas full, but only with gas ; the game was
to guess how much it consumed on- its trip.
Gay awnings under a panel of blue sky
framed by the tall buildings gave Martin-
place the look of some market scene east of
Suez, while Customs-square at the Quay
looked like a bit of Spain.
Sydney, modern and Edwardian, is in-
terested in the Cavendish divorce case, which
turned on the sportive ways of a P. and O.
purser. Marguerite Moreau, one of the co-
res., was until her departure for Europe a
popular Darling Point girl, and the success-
ful petitioner, Mrs. Cavendish, was one of
the Smiths, of Goderich. This was a fine
old place set in lovely gardens where now
Hampton Court and numerous other hostels
have established themselves. Captain Leslie
Wilson, beauty-man and private secretary
to Sir Harry liawson (he now has a Gov-
ernorship in India), married a step-cousin of
Mrs. Cavendish, who is a step-niece of Edith
Hill. A crowd of heiresses came out of this
Smithy. Cap’ll William Smith, the Caven-
dish dame’s grandfather, provided the inheri-
tances.
Ethel de Courcey-Bremer, the lady in the
picture, is the brilliant pianist whose work
has been
noticed at en-
tertainments of
the Sha k s-
pearean So-
ciety, the Play-
ers’ Club and
the Syd n e y
Uni. Dramatic
Society. Her
conspirators pn
such occasions
are Ethel Hol-
den and Tessie
Marshall.
Ethel’s ances-
try dates back

tions in the
naval annals
of England—a
Bremer served

Her great
grandfather brought out a shipload or two
of Britain’s erring children, and stayed on
to marry Governor Brisbane’s daughter. IJer
own father was Commander James Gordon-
Bremer, of H.M.S. Ringdove. So she is
more Australian than most, though she con-
trived to be born in Devonshire, The dark-
eyed Sylvia Bremer of screen fame is a
cousin.
Rupert Clarke and his girlish-looking wife
return to London in April; in the meantime
they are giving and being given a round of
intimate little parties. They were the guests
of honor at a theatrical supper-party planned
by the Herbert Nelson couple at the Astor.
Thither came Rupert’s lady in a Paquin
model of gold metal lace through which
glowed the richness of metal cloth of gold :
her only ornaments were the heir pearls, plus
a string which celebrated the arrival of baby
Elizabeth in England 12 months ago. Leon
Gordon, of “White Cargo” fame, was the lion
of the evening, and Mrs. Royston Verral,
who returns to England in March, was an-
other at the rose-decked supper-table.
If you are one of the oldsters w r ho saw
Nellie Stewmrt’s “Sweet Nell of Old Drury,”
you will be wanting to see her again in the
role. And if you are one of the youngsters
and have only heard of that wonderful per-
formance, you’ll be glad of the chance to
see Australia’s best girl in her best part, In
support of Nellie's radium appeal this play
of charm will be presented at Sydney Opera
House on April 22.
Burdekin House nets all sizes and condi-
tions of parties. You begin to wonder how
Sydney ever managed without its Macquarie-
street teahouse. The other afternoon the
Cumberland branch of the Country Women’s
Association met in its ballroom to farewell
Mrs. Colin Venn, who has been the branch's
acting-president for some time and is among
this week’s departures for Europe. Mrs.
James Ashton was the mouthpiece of the
assemblage, and Mrs. Mclntyre played lead
in the presentation act; she handed over a
soldier-wrought basket of great beauty brim-
ming with cactus-dahlias. A basket of roses
and an enormous posy of carnations were
other offerings that made the principal guest
resemble the Queen of the May. Mrs. Osborne-
England, who came late after settling the
affairs of the Nellie Stewart matinee, made
quite a stirring speech on behalf of Sister
Outback.
Herewith a portrait of Margaret Windeyer,
who is to have the bookstall at St. Paul’s
f6te on April
17. It’s an
appropriate
job, for Mar-
garet Win-
deyer is tii e
best- known
woman libra-
rian in Syd-
ney. She was
the first
trained woman
to work in
onr public
libraries; and
she has been
a ssociated
with the Mit-
chell Library
since the
death of her
father, Judge
Windeyer. She
studied her
work for two
years in the library school of New York
State; here she sat for, and passed with
distinction, a gruelling examination in litera-
ture. An ardent suffragist as a girl, she
was recording secretary to Rose Scott, who
was then busy with her Womanhood
Suffrage League. It was not so easy to be
a suffragist in those days when it often lost
you a partner at a dance; not so easy either
to persuade your family to let you join the
first, women's society to meet at night. That
was the Women’s laterary Society, and it
was regarded as very highbrow and daringly
advanced. Always a pioneer, Margaret Win-
deyer was largely responsible for the forma-
tion of our National Council of Women;
she it was who outlined the idea and design
of the American association, upon which the
Australian brafteh was modelled, at the Town
Ilall in 1896. But most of all one likes to
think of her, the young girl enthusiast from
Australia, reading her paper on womanhood
suffrage to that vast women’s convention in
Washington, and being acclaimed by no less
a personage than Julia Ward Howe, who
wrote “The Battle Ilymn of the Republic.”
Brenda Edwards, of Ashfield, wore her
mother’s wedding-dress of ivory brocades and
old lace when she kept her matrimonial
appointment with Dr. A. C. Burstal, of
Annandale. The dress had been just suffi-
ciently modernised for 1926, and over it
cascaded billows of tulle. White heather
pinned it, for luck, and the bride was finished
off by a cluster of white orchids and pink
carnations. There were three bridesmaids, in
blue and fuchsia coloring, and one flower-
scatterer in fluffy blue. St. Stephen’s blessed
the knot-tying; Dr. Colin Edwards best-
manned ; Lindley Evans was the organist, and
Roland Foster sang.
Another picturesque wedding shrined by
St. Stephen’s was that of Eleanor, the pretty
daughter of the Stubb-Browns, of Johannes-
burg. She married Dr. David Neilson Knox,
of North Sydney. The wedding-dress was a
shimmery affair of white satin and silver
encrusted with rhinestones. Nancy Wright
and Naee Moses ’maided in ethereal blues
and pinks, through which shone the gleam
of silver tissue, and were further embel-
lished by tulle head-dresses, rainbow-hued,
and beflowered silver w’ands. Bride’s cousins
Nora Kennedy and Dorothy Cornwell added
primrose georgettes to the picture. Burde-
kin House spread the wedding meats, which
were presided over by the bride's aunt, Mrs.
Kennedy.
Passed for ever from Macquarie-street,
which had learned to almost time itself from
his daily constitutional, Dr. Pat Ivenna, one
of the city’s noted eye men. Dr. Kenna, who
was a native of Orange, graduated at Sydney
Uni., took his diplomas at Edinburgh, and
studied eyes in Paris, Vienna and London.
His good-looking vddow is one of the three
daughters of late merchant Philip Riley.
Decima McLean said “I will’’ to Eric Mas-
ters (the name on the certificate was Le
Mestre) last w r eek. After the ceremony the
couple liad to attend to the business of amus-
ing the public at the Majestic, Newtown.
When the performance was over, the shivoo
to honor the occasion was held at Hector
Sinclair’s flat. Children of Edward McLean,
who was a great pantomimist and dance-
master with old-time theatrical firms, Decima
and her elder brother, Eddie, were brought
up to use their toes. They delighted Aus-
tralia as “The Little Dartos” over 20 years
ago, and have since toured the world. They
just managed to get out of Germany, where
they had made a sensation, when the wav
started. The two have been such chums that
Eddie is likely to feel like a lost sheep now
a husband has intruded on their companion-
ship.
Jerusalem and the Zionist Conference in
Vienna are Dr. Fanny Reading’s most vivid
memories of her 12 months abroad. Jeru-
salem, given back to the Jews and about to
be reborn as an agricultural country, stands
as her romantic ideal. There nobody bothers
to talk about being modern, and the new
young are so busy getting back to the soil
that they forget to posture for the limelight
of a post-war world. At the rate of 1000 a
week the Jews are entering into the Land
of Promise; and among the embryo farmers
are engineers, university men, musicians and
even brokers. The organisation is almost per-
fect, and before each new settlement is opened
up sanitation and swamp-drainage have
been attended to, eucalypts have been
planted, and electric light is installed. The
Jew immigrant who in Russia and other
countries of Europe was not allowed to own
land is enthusiastic in learning to carry on
the business of the original Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob. A name to conjure with in
Jerusalem is that of Henrietta Szold. She is
called the Florence Nightingale of Palestine;
it was she who sent the first medical unit
to Palestine after the war. Another world-
famous Zionist is Dr. Weizman, president
of the Zionist Conference in Vienna, to which
travelled 10,000 delegates, each of whom,
Dr. Reading says, spoke at least five
languages—many of them spoke ten. Dr.
Fanny not only attended this affair, but
was a speaker at the Women’s Inter-
national Zionist Conference, and was an
alternate delegate at the quinquennial con-
vention of the International Council of
Women. The two veterans at this were
Lady Aberdeen, a hale and eloquent 76, and
Tasmanian Mrs. Dobson, who is over SO.
The most touching moment of the conference
was when Mrs. Dobson resigned her seat
on the council and said good-bye to her old
colleagues. Women from 45 countries came
to the pow-wow. One of the most attractive
was Mrs. Walker-Wildobrandt, assistant
Attorney-General of the TT.S.A. and the ter-
ror of the bootleggers; and one of the most
direct, incisive and arresting speakers was
Ruby Board, of Sydney.
Miss Brisbane’s chronicle: —
The captain and officers of the Otarama were feted
by Colonel and Mrs. D. E. Evans at Lennon’s in
a setting of pink roses. Among the throng were
Captain and Mrs. Willis, the Watsons, the Hur-
woods, Joyce Pirie, (trace Brown, Captain Upston and
a bevy of gold-braid that arrived in time to dance
in the ballroom.
Red carnations decked the dinner-table when Miss
Fitzgerald gathered together some pals at Lennon’s,
among them the Halfords, Madge and Beryl Mac-
donald, Rodney Macdonald and J. Bannister.
The Cadell-Garricks are back from visiting a
daughter in China; the W. L. Fowles family are
staying at the Gresham since their grand tour, and
the Firmin McKinnons are at the Guest House,
Tambourine.
Mary McGregor spent a. short holiday with her
people here, and is now off to join the Boucicaults
in Melbourne.
Died in St. Martin’s Hospital, the wife of Co-
adjutor-Bishop Lefanu. She came here as a bride
more than 20 years ago, and leaves a family of six,
her baby son being only a few days old. She trained
at Guy’s, London, before her marriage, and also
studied art at the Slade school. Being very musical,
she acted as deputy-organist to the Anglican Cathe-
dral in Brisbane. She was an expert needlewoman,
and of a very bright and attractive disposition.
Airs. Winifred Cook, one of the active workers
on the committee of the Authors and Artists’ Asso-
ciation, has gone to Sydney, where she will live in
future, doing work on Steele Rudd's new magazine.
Greater Brisbane is busy justifying its name by
levelling roads and widening squares and creating
dust and steam-roller excitements in the suburban ways.
It is a pity the street-broadening seems in so many
cases to mean the uprooting of old friends amongst
the big trees in side streets, especially in this land
of strong sunlight and • grateful shadow.
News comes from China of the marriage of Nancy
Power, of the Bowen-terrace clan, to Frank Smith
at Amoy on February 27.
The O’Connor boathouse was done up for the Gilbey
Cup regatta, and there was dancing between events
to the strains of a jazz-band. The Deputy-Governor,
with Fred Ryder, was on board the Redwing, and
there was a .good roll-up. The Commercial Rowing
Club gave a , dance in the evening.
At the Brisbane Boys’ Grammar School were sports
for the 57th anniversary of the school’s foundation.
The Bousfields had a luncheon party for tiie competing
teams, and amongst the onlookers were the Eskdale
Lords, Stephensons and Guy Jj’ Estranges. On the
same day Mayor Jolly opened the new swimming-
baths in the Valley. They cost £25,000.

MISSES MONKE DOVLE
Phones Cotral 1532, 1533.
The Stradbrokes had a busy day at State
Government House on Monday, with a gar-
den party in the afternoon and a farewell
dance to daughter Helena at night.
The Stradbrokes’ swan song to the general
public was sung at the alfresco affair, over
4000 guests putting in an appearance. The
visitors’ book evidently had been well combed
so that no deserving soul might be left out.
The dressing was summery, the heat being
fierce. The guests wandered over lawns of
emerald velvet to the cow pastures, where in
numerous marquees tablecloths were spread
and the multitude was fed to the strains of a
brass band. Lady Stradbroke looked cool
and comfortable in a frock of white geor-
gette with deep flounces, under black mil-
linery. Helena Rous wore floral ninon with
a golden-brown hat. The smartest bit of
apparel viewed was Mrs. Russell Grimwade’s
all-pleated georgette gown with lots of but-
tons and a straw headpiece of the same hue.
Mrs. Mclnerney, in a mauve-embroidered
frock, was accompanied by daughter Aileen,
wearing a big black hat with a white silk
gown. The Norman Brookes matron had a
faint pink georgette gown covered with a
cloak of ficelle radium lace and georgette,
topped with rose-decked millinery. Chief
Justice Irvine and lady, tlie Barretts and
Colonel Dowse were in the throng.
A wonderful night, fine and cool, followed
the hot, weary day. The grounds of Stoning-
ton were lit with myriads of colored globes,
and there was jazzing in the drawing-room.
Four hundred guests were bidden, the flock
numbering polo visitors from the States and
outback. Frocks worn were. delightful,
mainly of the glistening variety, or gold or
black lace. The hostess wore a trained gown
of dull black satin brightened with diamente,
daughter Helena being clad in silver tissue
draped to a side adornment of a spray of
black flowers. The Governor-General’s lady,
in reseda-green georgette, with crystal fringe
attachment and a ripple of diamonds in her
coiffure, was there. Lady Hastings, who
More gold lame, severely plain, seemed to
be under the wfing of Mrs. Hunter Pattison,
M'hose black lace frock had an encrustation
of medallions of brocaded cretonne. Two
good-looking matrons were Mrs. George
Blackn-ood, crowned M T ith gold leaves and
clothed in gold tissue and lace, and Mrs.
Charlie Lyon, in filmy draperies of black
lace. Mrs. Winter Irving looked striking
in platinum lace tissue and fringe. Mrs. Jim
Fairbairn M'as sheathed in silver and mauve
shot lame, with fringes of mauve and pink
beads.
The Government House ballroom was de-
nuded of its blue felt and decked out with
all sorts of greenery for the hop given by
the G.-G. and his lady. Though officially
termed a “small dance,” it was an affair of
500 guests, the visiting polo-players and bar-
rackers being bidden to draw near. The
show was a means of giving the G.-G.’s cham-
berlain an insight into the fact that Aus-
tralian neM'spapers do not send their repre-
sentatives round to the “tradesmen’s en-
trance.” An invitation to social writers
issued during the Forsters’ reign, and the
cause of a great deal of trouble in its day,
M'as discovered on the file at Government
House divorced from the letters it pro-
voked by way of reply, and was accepted
as the proper form of communication in such
cases. Newspaper representatives were told
they must sit in the musicians’ gallery, wear-
ing day dress —-to remove any lingering
chance that they might be mistaken for
guests, apparently—and warned not to expect
admittance until three-quarters of an hour
after the arrival of people who had been pro-
perly invited. Of course there Mas a storm.
Self-respecting editors and the A.J.A. got
on their hind legs, and there were apologies
and explanations. The gold-lettered official
pasteboard of invitation was tendered to the
pen women, who accepted it, and let bygones
be bygones.
The dance was not of the stiff and starchy
order. The G.-G. pranced through the first
one-step M'ith the State Governor’s lady, and
his Excellency of Victoria tripped it with
his vice-regal hostess, whose robe suggested
the Arabian Nights, being dull-gold lace
which melted into ruby bead embroidery with
a fringe around the hem, and had wanderings
of cactus-red georgette from the shoulders,
with diamonds and a head-dress that fitted
well into the picture. Silver and diainente
brightened Lady Stradbroke’s black satin
gown, and daughter Helena danced in a red
crepe georgette frock with beads of the same
hue. Mrs. Pitt Rivers had mauve and gold
lame appearing beneath an embossing of gold.
Outstanding in the dress display was Mrs.
Tom Grantham’s apparel of oyster-white,
encrusted with glitter in pearls, sapphires
and crystal. Mrs. Ronald Angus (S.A.) in
a gown of Oriental red traced with gold and
inlet with silver lace, was a good second.
Wedgwood-blue raiment punctuated by many
wee ribbon rosettes of the same hue was
the choice of Mrs. Eric Murray (S.A.). To
Maisie Cameron, of the Apple Isle, belongs
the distinction of sporting a monocle, which
dangled from black ribbon over a frock of
filmy black lace. Grey fur bordered Mrs.
Keith Calvert's gown of tapestry brocade
in tones of green and gold. Much favored
were frocks of what might be termed “liu-
gerie”-pink, so faint was the shade, and there
were precious few matrons who did not
feature glistening bead embroidery. The
maidens, who were there in bevies, clusters
and galaxies, leaned to georgette of the
handkerchief-flounce mode, and all tones of
green were popular. Cassie Connolly, of
West Australia, wore floral ninon. A Cox
lass, who wore a geranium-red frock, had her
throat wrapped in a black satin scarf
attached to a turbaned head-dress. Another
girl struck a new note by tying yards of
green georgette round her neck, the fabric
forming a sort of toga over a glistening white
gown. Estelle Manifold came in her Court
dress of white, crystal-embroidered.
The evening upon which young people
danced away the hours at Government House
was chosen by Mrs. Archibald Currie to
gather a more mature dance-party at Car-
lyon’s as a sort of au revoir fling to the
Willie Campbell couple, Mrs. Arthur Bulli-
vant and Miss May Bullivant, who are all
booked for Europe. Dr. Gray and sister
Muriel showed in the gathering, with the
Walter Bayles and the recently-returned Mr.
and Mrs. Holmes Hunt. Colonel Tivey and
George Paxton, still nimble on their feet,
were among the dancers. The hostess fed
her crowd at Millicent, her home at Toorak.
The late Sam McKay’s widow is contem-
plating a brief return to look into local in-
terests. Life in the Cold Country amid the
scenes of her youth has turned the sprightly
lady who was Fan Dango into a restless
being who makes comet-like dashes across
Europe. Her son Peter, now at Harrow,
will presently stand amongst the great land-
owners of this country. Besides the Ber-
wick estate, on which his father poured out
money for unique improvements, the West-
ralian stations and interests came to little
Peter when his half-brother went out in a
flying crash.
Constance Burt, here pictured, is taking her
voice to Italy for additional polish and experi-
ence. Connie,
though a Syd-
n eysider by
birth, is a pro-
duct of the
Albert - street
Conserva-
torium. Mary
Campbell has
been guiding
the soprano’s
warblings and
trillings for
some time, and
regards her as
a most promis-
in g student.
The lass has
appeared with
success here in
operatic and
other perfor-
anc e s, and
will sing her
farewell at the Assembly Hall on March 18.
Kniglit Sam Hordern i.s still chuckling
over an experience that befell him when the
bookies were calling the odds at Flemington
on the Australian Cup. Having been intro-
duced to a party of women, Samuel advised
them to back Pilliewinkie, sportingly saying,
“I’ll return your money if you lose it—but
yon won’t.” One of the group, who hadn’t
caught his name, thought he was some cheer-
ful tyro giving a too-sanguine tip. So she
warned him not to be silly, explaining that
Sam Hordern knew nothing about horses,
and Pilliewinkie was no good. Her com-
panions endeavored to cut short the unflatter-
ing recital, and eventually they managed to
get a word in edgeways and end the mis-
understanding. When Pilliewinkie carried
off the Cup, his owner enjoyed telling the
racing fraternity how he was warned off his
own horse.
Polo tournament finals drew lots of sports,
mainly of the shingled sex, to Moonee
Valley on a sunny afternoon. The Governor
and Lady Stradbroke dispensed refreshment
in an arbor on the flat. Among the tea-
drinking throng was the Governor-Geuerars
lady in champagne-toned embroidered apparel
worn under a pink coat and harmonised hat.
Her two small daughters also tucked their
knees under the special tablecloth. The vice-
regal hostess wore a flounced frock of black
georgette and magpie millinery. Lady
Helena sported a frock of floral ninon, with
a crinoline hat. Mary Hinton Pitt Rivers
was in primrose crepe de Chine with a black
headpiece. Noticed among the guests from
atar was Mrs. Douglas Fraser, from Banana-
land, whose henna velour hat topped a crepe-
de-Chine jumper-suit of cedarwood tone.
The kindly eyes and sensitive mouth illus-
trated belong to Professor William Adolphus
Laver, who
after 32 years’
a s s o ciation
with Mel-
bourne Uni.,
vacates the
Chair of
Music to go
farming. In
future he will
take a practi-
cal as well as
an aesthetic in-
terest in such
thunderstorms
as are depicted
in the Waid-
stein Sonata
and the Rain-
drop Prelude,
and he will be
able to make
contrasts be-
tween the songbirds of the bush and those
of the city. He has been Ormond Professor
of Music and Director of the Conservatorium
—the only one in the Empire attached to a
University chair of music—since 1915. At
a good-bye tea-party given by Professor and
Mrs. Laver at Melba Hall, it was mentioned
that the only member of the original teach-
ing staff remaining was ’cellist Louis Hatten-
bach.
The Hunt Club frolic at the St. Kilda
Town Hall, besides winding up the polo
tournament frivolities with a blaze of glory,
brought piles of needful coin to the coffers
of the Women’s Hospital. There was a big
crowd, and many pretty gowns competed
for attention with the pink coats of the
huntsmen. Polo-players wore their teams’
colors across shirt-fronts with aristocratic
effect. The decorations were on a color
scheme of hunting pink and gold, and trophies
of the chase, sticks and balls, mingled with
names of hunt-clubs and polo teams, found
place upon the walls. Both Federal and
State Governors came along, “attended,” as
they say in the Shakspearean stage direc-
tions. The Stonehaven lady, who waved a
fan of many feathers over a georgette gown
of flame hue with sparkling embroidery,
tripped many a measure, and her opposite
number from the State Government House
east opulent radiance with a tiara of dia-
monds and rubies shining above a black robe
all-overed with crystal bugles. Frosted-
silver lame draped daughter Helena’s slim-
ness. Mary Hinton Pitt Rivers was clothed
in pink and gold brocade attached to a black
hem and gold embroidery. The A. V. His-
kens matron, who presides over the hospi-
tal’s committee, wore dove-grey brocade with
a dado of self-toned blossoms, purple-lined.
South Australians, who take back with them
the Stradbroke Cup, rolled up in full force.
A day as balmy as spring and the hope of
getting a bit back from Donald Melsaacs
lured most of the world, his wife and his
best girl to Flemington on Saturday for the
close of the Y.R.C. meeting, which, taken all
round, has been the hottest and, in more
senses than one, the dryest for years. A few
new summer dresses were to be seen, and
a few early winter gowns put in an appear-
ance, but the staple feminine garb was the
black lace frock —and very nice, too. Lun-
cheon parties and gatherings for afternoon-
tea were dotted all over the place. Hospi-
tality of this sort was handed out by the
Harry Creswick pair; also by Mrs. Sam
McCaughey, _ wearing the latest dictate of
autumn fashion in the form of a coat-jumper
suit and hat of bottle-green.
Per lan Hay’s patchily-humorous corned}',
“The Sport of Kings,” we got more of the
turf and the unpunctual quadruped at the
Athenaeum. The play left the barrier for
its maiden handicap with generous vice-
regal backing, the guests of the G.-G. over-
flowing from box to dress-circle. Opposite
were the State Governor and his party, her
Ex. wearing a wonderful lace wrap that shed
rays of silver and platinum over a clinging
black robe. Mrs. Alan Currie, who was
with her, was also metallic, in a pale gold
lace frock. The G.-G.’s fair-haired lady
had a coat of brocade in jade tones over a
gown of dark-green velvet, and a coronet of
dark-green loaves. Miss Ryder, from South
Australia, had a glistening frock of Wedg-
wood blue. The play is not a dressy—or
undressy—one, but Zillah Bateman, who
plays the poor secretary, wears two quite
attractive gowns. These must be relics of
better days, and even at that dry old Amos
Purdie, had he been anywhere but on the
stage, would not have overlooked the in-
congruity of his secretary taking notes and
operating a dictaphone in an evening-frock
of gold lace with a touch of color about the
waistline, and an equally smart one of
geranium color brocaded in gold leaves. Cerid-
wen Kelly, who has graduated from the Mel-
bourne Repertory Theatre Society, makes a
delightful flapper in neat pleated frocks
belted and collared, of dark green and fawn
respectively, and she wears also a dashing
fancy costume of gipsy mode, chiefly in green
and black.
Controversy raged at one of the polo
matches over the color of a pony usually
classed among the creamies. One smart
maiden declared it to be of the new shade,
beige, while other fashion-followers argued
that the horsey is of the ficelle tint. One
thing is certain : that beige—or ficelle —little
’nn will have to be content to rank as just a
plain creamy when he gets back to the home
paddock.
The Moule family has folded its wings at
Myoora, the late Robert Harper’s one-time
home, now a flattery. High-Court Justice
Isaacs is a near neighbor.
Randwick’s William Kelso tarried in Mel-
bourne after the Flemington meeting to see
his wife and daughter Jean off by the Otran-
to. Mother and daughter are cricket enthusi-
asts, and intend witnessing the Test matches.
They return to Sydney via the U.S.A.
The widow of the late William Leonard
is off this week with her daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Clive Leonard, and family for Europe.
Also bound for England and the Continent
by the Otranto are Mrs. Howard Berx-y and
Airs. Burchill.
At the Fitzroy Town Hall a matinee musi-
cale arranged by Mrs. F. B. Suhr, acting-
Mayoress of Fitzroy, was a source of finan-
cial aid to the local creche and kindergarten.
Several singers and violinist Violet McGregor,
marshalled by tenor Walter Kirby, took part
in a progx*amme that was punctuated by tea
and ices.
A boarder at one of our very selectest
girls’ seminaries her father is a much-
landed squatter—'answered one of those
pathetic pleas in the matrimonial column of
a city paper: “Young man, 23, w r ould like
meet refined young lady; view above.” The
advertiser’s picture showed him to be a
lovely boy, and he wrote, from a country
post-office, the most enchanting letters. A
secret engagement followed. When the
r<*nantic scliool-miss went back to the
ancestral acres for the Christmas vacation,
the rouseabout sent to fetch her luggage was
the young man of the photograph. Contrary
to all the rules of the movie scenario, the
young man hit the road with his bluey on his
back exactly two days afterwards.
Dr. Esme V. Anderson, recently resident
at the Eye and Ear Hospital, East Mel-
bourne, who has been gleaning knowledge
abroad, has won the Diploma of Ophthalmic
Medicine and Surgery of the Royal College
of Physicians and Surgeons, England. A
daughter of the J. L. Andersons, of Auburn,
she was educated at the P.L.C., and gradu-
ated at Ormond.
Sister Adelaide writes :
The Domestic Emergency Corps has taken stock
of its first six months’ activities and announces
responses to domestic SOS’s at the rate of 38 a month,
and to places as far afield as Mount Gambier and
Georgetown, Renmark and the Burra, A few per-
manent billets have been filled, but even the Emer-
gency Corps does not find it easy to solve that
problem of housekeeping.
The Conservatorium has had an opening night as
the prelude to its year's work—the programme a
word or two from Dr. Davies on the plans for the
year, a brief lecture on musical history, supper and
dancing.
The Society of Arts has shaken itself out of
summer sleep, also, and with President White as
host spent a cheerful evening, at which the chief
point of interest was a group of new pictures by
D’ Auvergne Boxall and L. Howie, the result of holi-
day work in Sydney and about our owni Gulf coast.
Meanwhile the flappers have been frivolling at the
Floating Palais —a carnival night of the “fancy-
dress optional” variety, with prizes for those fan-
tastically bedizened, and caps, balloons and streamers
to add to the giddiness. The Wallace Bruce and
Lavington Bonython matrons did the judging and
glanced with most approval on a balloon girl clad
all in white.
Allan Wilkie and his company have been demon-
strating to us the charm of an age when petticoats
were known and shingling wasn’t. Which reminds
me that Professor Strong, always his staunch sup-
porter, is back from England and in possession of
Harold Wylde's rooms at Burnside while he (Wylde)
is taking his turn at tripping abroad.
Mount Gambier, in the far south-eastern corner
of the State, close to the Victorian border,
has been having the biggest Back Home
week so far staged in these parts. Special
attention was paid to the old home of Adam Lind-
say Gordon, whom several people present could
remember. Premier Gunn came along and contrasted

They mean the simplification of the confused and unorganised
financial functions that in this country stand in the way of national and
individual progress.
They mean making easy the financing of public, semi-public and
private enterprises and the proper marketing of our products.
They mean progress for Australia and they mean a sound invest-
ment for the shareholder.
Remember always that there are no promoters’ or vendors’ shares
in any of the companies, and' that no attempt will be made to start
operations until sufficient capital has been subscribed to warrant complete
confidence. YOU can make the time of starting very early by applying

NOTIONS
Pilliewinkie was the hero of the V.R.C.
Autumn Meeting. Samuel Hordern had no luck with
Bronzino, Iveneppil and other costly purchases, but
Fortune glad-eyed him when he gave 250-0 guineas
for the Winkie-Waterspray gelding, who has already
earned him four times that amount in stakes. Pillie-
winkie won a race on each day of the meeting,
including the Australian Cup, in which he carried
9st. 61b. and created an Australasian record (3min.
5] fsec.) for 2j miles. Were the Cup run over
again the solid Maorilander’s most formidable oppo-
nent would probably be Highlander, the fourth
horse, who two days later won the Autumn Handi-
cap, 13 furlongs, in 2min. 45sec., after having been
an apparently hopeless last most of the way. In
the retrospect, Highlander needed another gallop or
two before the Cup race. George Young, who thor-
oughly understands the game gelding from M.L.,
rode him in all his races. Young has improved
greatly since he steered Gloaming in the latter’s
matches against Beauford —he was anything but a
first-class horseman then.
After his triumph in the Governor’s Plate on the
third day, starting- at 9 to 4 on, Pilliewinkie was
naturally a hot favorite for the King’s Plate, 2
miles, on Saturday. The books demanded 9 to 2,
Lemina being quoted at 7, Lilypond at 14, Accarak
at 25 and Bolet Satan at 50 to 1. The last-named
horse led for most of the journey, but about five
furlongs from home Lemina took charge. Pillie-
winkie ran up to the S.A. mare at the turn, and,
coming on at his leisure, won easily by 24 lengths
from Accarak, who was a couple of lengths ahead
of Lilypond, who pulled up groggy. Lemina, who
tired, was a length further back, and Bolet Satan,
in his usual position, last. The time was 3min.
27|sec.
For the Leonard Stakes, six furlongs, Adrift (9st.
51b.) was always favorite —7 to 2 at the finish —-
with Fuji San at 5 to 1 (he was backed from B’s),
Amontillado at 7 to 1, Swift 8, Manacre 10 and the
others from 12 to 33 to 1. Fuji San went to the
front about a furlong from home and won brilliantly
by three parts of a length from Yea Princess (14 to
1), with Versine and Swift dead-heating for third
place, a length away. The winner, who should have
been favorite after his third in the Newmarket,
carried 9st. lllb. and ran the distance in lmin.
12sec. By Valais —-Lady San, he is owned by J. P.
Arthur and trained by O. Hodson, and he was ridden
a confident race by Young.
The Gibson Carmichael Stakes, for two-year-olds,
went to Hawick (10), with the fast-finishing Har-
binger (9 to 2) and Epilogue in the places. The
favorites, King Osric and Satyrus, ran badly. Hawick,
who was successful at Mentone recently, is by Kenil-
worth —Linaceae, and is owned by A. S. Chirnside
and trained by E. Fisher. He ran the seven fur-
longs in lmin. 26 jsee.
For the Northcote Handicap, 12 furlongs, the con-
sistent Valbee (third in the Australian Cup) was
favorite at 3 to 1, with Frances Tressady (s),Naos
(6) and King of Mirth (7) next in demand. Valbee
took the lead below the distance and, ridden a great
finish by Bob Lewis, just got the verdict by half a
head from the unlucky Gungool (8), while Naos was
half a length away; time, 2min. 33sec. The winner,
who carried 7st. 131 b., is by Valais —Linbee. A
capital stayer, who may yet do more important things,
he is owned by E. L. Buxton and trained by S.
Cusdin.
Sol Green’s imported horse Robespierre (7 to 1)
was successful in the Farewell Handicap, one mile,
alter a great struggle with the Sydney three-year-old
Eridanus (14), a head separating them at the finish;
Ouragan (14) was a length behind Eridanus and Pers-
pective (7 to 2) fourth. Metellus, the favorite, ran
badly, but he may show better form at Randwick.
The winner is by Phalaris—Austral, and, going on
the fact that he has come from behind in his last
two -winning races and stuck it out well, it is
thought that he will stay. The time was lmin. 39sec.
Thanks to Pilliewinkie’s victories in the Essen-
don Stakes, Australian Cup, Governor’s Plate and
King’s Plate, Samuel Hordern was the most success-
ful owner at the meeting. Next to him came J. E.
and C. H. Brien, owners of Rampion, and C. B. Kellow,
who is preposterously alleged to have collected
£47,000 in Heroic-and-Pilliewinkie wagers. These
yarns provide pleasant diversion for the Income-Tax
Commissioners. Heroic’s Newmarket gallop was cer-
tainly brilliant, but The Night Patrol made him look
very ordinary in the C. M. Lloyd Stakes. Young’s six
winning rides easily gave him first place among the
jockeys.
Cajole (The Welkin —Flowery Speech) is
only second-rate, but, judiciously placed and artis-
tically ridden by Pike, she has been very useful to
the elder Kelso this season. Her success in the
Highweight Handicap at Rosehill (N.S.W'.) on Satur-
day was the third in two months. Hit was favorite
at 5 to 2 (Kelso’s filly was half a point longer), but
he was too badly placed in the first furlong to have
any chance afterwards; it was Cilix, brother to
Erasmus (25 to 1), who gave the favorite most,
cheek. Cajole’s sister Persuasion (evens) showed
speed and gameness in the second division of the
Nursery Handicap, but was unable to concede 41b.
to Royal Tea (9 to 4), who ran the 6-J furlongs in
lmin. 7sec., course-record time. A chestnut gelding
by imported Tea Tray—Duchess Eudorus, Royal Tea
exhibited good form in Maoriland, and the handi-
capper blundered in letting him in at 7st. 61b. in
a poor field. The country horse Bongula (Bronzette
-—Gula) proved himself a long way above Trial
Stakes form in the first division of that race, as also
did John Brown’s Bunting Wallace (Wallace Isinglass
-—Smart Walk) in the second division. The Bongula
people got threes and better for their money (Ivalloni,
who ran third, was at 5 to 4), arid Brown’s slippery
chestnut was 10 to 9 on. Johnnie Jones (10 to 1)
defeated the indifferently-ridden St. Eaton (7 to 2)
and Stony in the Club Handicap, and consistent Night
Heron’s well-deserved victory at 8 to 1 in the Rydal-
inere Handicap, wherein Virgin Gold galloped as if
he might do better in the autumn than he did in
October, sent Teddy Leys and the bookmakers home
smiling.

The A.J.C. handicapper has been very
rough on what he reckons the five best horses in
the A.J.C. Doncaster Handicap. Starting with Top
Gallant, lOst. 71b., he has given The Night Patrol
lOst. 31b., Heroic iOst. 21b., Whittier 9st. 131 b.,
and The Hawk 9st. lllb. Whittier and The Hawk
need not be considered, and the other three are
unlikely starters ; indeed, owners of champion milers
will avoid the Doncaster until the A.J.C. man frames
his handicaps on a lower scale. Metellus (fist.) is
well treated, considering that he dead-heated with
Boaster for the Epsom with Bst. 71b., and won the
Tooralc with 9st. lib. ; and others who impress at
a first glance are Yalicare (Bst. 91b.), the stable-
mates Leslie Wallace (Bst. 121 b.) and Bunting
Wallace (7st. 101 b.), Hemisphere (Bst. 81b.), Honan
(Bst.), Irish Prince (7st.. 121 b.), Egerton (7st. 71b.)
and Border Chief (7st. 21b.). Irish Prince reads
ALEXANDER ( S.A.), the hatting find of
1925-26. If he had been 38 instead of
18, he icould no doubt have been sent
to England.
~ , ,
as well as anything, for the best has not been seen
of him, but he is not a horse to back before the day
of the race. .....

Only one 10-stoner (Marvel, who had 10.4 in
1892) has won a Doncaster, but nine-stoners have
won four of the last six Sydney Cups. 1 llliewmkie

“Petrie”: John Wren’s sand-track at
Breakfast Greek (Brisbane) is not much class as a
racecourse, but as a thrill-provider it beats a two-ring
circus hollow. Consider a few of the happenings at
a recent meeting. In the First Division the barrier
(a single strand of rope) refused to rise when the
starter said “Go,” and the horses dived underneath
it, two of them scraping off their jockeys in the
process. The field was scattered over the landscape
like Brown’s cows. The riderless favorite, Marcoda,
continued in the race, and, finishing in great style,
cut down the stragglers in the straight and beat
everything except the winner. In the Second Division,
a scene from “Blood and Sand” was staged. Eudo-
rean fell in the straight when tailed off. Some
attendants roped the fallen mare, which appeared to
MEDICALLY TESTED.
BUNKER: “My doctor tells me 1 can’t play
golf.”
CLARA: “So he’s played with you, too!”
have broken its back, and dragged it off the track
into the long grass on the flat, where the poor brute
was left floundering about in agony for the rest of
the afternoon. In the Fourth Division Teebing bolted
round the course before the race, and the saddle
slipped off Wallanthus, compelling his jockey to com-
plete the journey on foot. In the Plate,’with the
rank outsider Orient Mail winning all the way, the
rest of the field indulged in a bumping race. At
the end of the day there was a great demand for
sticking-plaster in the jockeys’ room.

There were well over 8000 people at the
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, and it looked a
sea of flesh-pink except where black smudges indi-
cated the presence of the fighters and their
entourage. Two blacks never made a fight, the old
saw r says, and it held good on this occasion. “Tiger”
Payne essayed a somewhat tigerish pounce for a
start, but Len Johnson’s sangfroid and undeniable
skill of fence clipped the tiger’s claws, so to speak,
and he lapsed into his own personality, a baffled,
slogging darky. His frightfulness towards the in-
offensive atmosphere evoked frequent bursts of hilarity.
Payne continued to give an imitation of a tiger,
according to his lights, and Johnson to play the
frigid, contemptuous swordsman right to the end
of the 20th round. Up to half-way there appeared
to be a good chance that Len would out “Tiger,”
but the latter’s brute strength told in the later
rounds, and Johnson had to box and evade to save
his bacon from the tiger's paws. Only one verdict
was possible, and referee Wallis crowned Johnson.
Weights; Johnson, list. 2fib.; Payne, list. 31b.
* * * *
Billy Grime (9st. fib.) gave his light-
weight crown an airing at the Melbourne Stadium on
Saturday, and retained the bauble despite the efforts
of Bert McCarthy (9st. BRb.) to annex it. From
the outset the pace was fast, with Grime showing
an unusually vigorous attack which threatened for
a time to overwhelm McCarthy. After the seventh
round Mac. introduced a straight left which found
Billy’s face frequently; but Grime launched another
vigorous offensive in the 11th round, and a succession
of heavy rights had Mae. floundering. There was
too much infighting in the second half of the battle.
Grime finished with a comfortable margin of points.
■* » * *
“Shrewsbury” : One reads with infinite
regret that the aged Harry Stone was awarded a
20-round fight on points in Perth (W.A.) the other
night. As the audience is said to have objected
vehemently to the verdict, it seems probable that
the referee’s respect for eld outweighed his better
judgment. But -that is not going far enough. Some-
thing should be done by authority to prevent the
ring appearances of these weary veterans. People
are not allowed to work lame or foundered horses,
and anyone who has seen Stone sprint his way
through a 20-round “fight” must realise that he has
probably developed laminitis by this. Other sports
provide for their ancient retainers. Look at the
Australian XI, for instance. Something restful, like
a seat in Parliament, might be found for Stone, and
if he could retain his agility he might become a
Premier.
* * * *
“Julian”: Perhaps kindly memories of
Peter Jackson have something to do with Sydney’s
indulgence to colored pugs. (B. 25/’2/’26). One
night Peter was at Foley’s old place in York-street
soon after he had beaten Tom Lees for the cham-
pionship, and challenges were being handed round.
A red-haired Scotchman, a bit ancient, named Jem
Stewart —he was a recent arrival from Britain, where
he had been beaten by Alf Greenfield —-wanted a
match with Peter, but could stake only 25 pounds
or shillings, I forget which. Foley’s Saturday-
night crowd began to jeer him. George Mulholland,
Jack Mollov, “Deerfoot” and some more of them
badgered him till he was ropeable. Then Peter
removed his hat and stepped into the ring. “Boys,”
he said, “this man is old enough to be your father.
If that’s how' you white men respect old age, thank
God I’m a. blaekfellow.” The mob behaved like a
Sunday-school class after that.
Randolph Rose, the Maoriland farmer, set
the seal on his fame by running the mile in 4min.
13 3-5 sec., or within a fraction of 6sec. better
than the Australasian record, 4min. 18 2-5 sec.,
which has stood since 1914. The run, which comes
within 3sec. of Paavo Nurmi’s world record, was
against American Louis Hahn, and took place at
Masterton (M.L.). It was the fourth meeting of the
pair. Rose has evidently improved with the racing,
and possibly by watching the methods of the expertly-
coached Americans. Two days after his record Rose
again finished ahead of the American, though he was
handicapped out of first place. The delighted Maori-
iand athletic authorities are talking of sending Ran-
dolph to London for the British championships, in
which Nurmi may compete this year.
* * * *
Young athletes did well at the N. S,
Wales championship meeting at Manly. C. D.
Spicer (Kensington) was the find; he won the 120
yards hurdles (17sec.) and the high jump (sft. 9in.),
and will improve on_ both efforts before long. R.
Winn (Western Suburbs), who has been prominent
in club events, took the 100 yards easily in 10 3-10
sec.; W. Hunt (East) landed the 440 yards in 50
1-10 sec. ; C. Macdonald won the mile stylishly in
4min. 30 2-5 sec.; and policeman W. F. Payne’s
javelin-throw of 166 ft. fin. was a lot better than
opponents could manage. Those who retained their
titles were G. R. Parker, in the three-miles walk
(21min. 56 4-5 sec.) ; D. W. McKav, in the broad
jump (22ft. 9jin.) ; and G. Lewis (Q.), in the 161 b.
shot (41ft. 2in.). A ladies’ championship (75 yds.)
was also decided; it went to Miss E. Robinson (Hor-
dernian) in 9-}sec. But many old-timers frown on
the innovation.

If numbers mean anything—and they sel-
dom do in sport—Vic. should be able to produce a
Davis Cup contestant out of its army of triers this
season. On the first day of the autumn tournament
at Albert Park, Melb., 126 matches were fought.
K. B. Brown showed doggedness in facing the buffets
of Schlesinger, last year’s singles champion, and
brought the third set to 12 games before he was
put out. Holland, the best man in the provinces,
defeated St. Hilda’s crack, H. Wallace; P. Haege,
a 'Varsity cub of promise, demolished an A-grade
S. Yarra man in T. E. Robinson; and S. G. Lum, the
interesting Chinaman, showed increasing cunning
in his match with A. Russell. Nobody stood out
Sufficiently, however, to set the prophets speculating.
The Vie. bowlers followed up their Sydney
triumphs in the single-handed and rink champion-
ships by going through the inter-State matches un-
defeated. They scored in all 538 points to their
opponents’ 409. N. S. Wales, with an aggregate
points score of 507 to 419, was beaten only by Vic;
Queensland went under to Vic. and N. S. Wales;
Westralia scored against South Aus. and Tasmania,
and S.A.’s only victory was over the men from
Lyons’ islet.
* * * *
“G. 0.8.”: Before dashing off with the
Australian XI, Hendry put up what is claimed as an
Australian record by making five centuries in con-
secutive pennant innings—120, 125, 137, 109 n.o.
and 157. Yet his pennant figures for the season
are not sensational—7s4 runs, average 107 —and do
not threaten the record Trumper put up 28 years
ago. Victor went one century better than Hendry,
but his six three-figure scores of 123, 125, 120. n. 0.,
101 n. 0., 133 and 162 n.o. were broken with an
82 andean 85. Aggregate, 1021; average, 204.
“Past Grammar”: Kelleway's refusal of
the professional cricketer’s job offered him by Rams-
bottom, one of the Lancashire League clubs, may
be just as well for all parties. Charlie’s style of
batting is hardly suited to cricket where matches
have to be decided in a day, with thousands of
pounds in bets depending on the results. The same
objection may be taken to his bowling, for, save
with the new ball, he is not so much a wicket-
getter nowadays as a steadier of well-set batsmen.
Still, poor Frank O’Keefe, himself a very gradual
run-compiler in Australia, did well with bat and
ball during his brief spell in League cricket, and,
like Macdonald, would probably have been claimed
for Lancashire had he lived.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: If the English selectors
cannot pick out England’s best team with Wilfrid
Rhodes and Hobbs to help, they should be set to
umpire lawn-tennis matches between stars for the
rest, of their lives. Rhodes is considered the
best living judge of a cricketer in Britain, even
Hobbs standing down to the Yorkshireman in this
respect. For years Yorkshire and England captains,
not forgetting the haughty Hawke, never acted
without hearing what “Wilfrid had to say about it,”
and the list of the skippers under whom he played
includes the autocratic Jackson and the omniscient
Warner. Gilligan’s appearance on the selection com-
mittee has started the impression that he will be
England’s first captain after all. He did so well
against the before coming to Australia
as to indicate that he is a much better all-rounder
in England than we found him here. Perrin’s inclu-
sion is a. surprise, for the big Essex man has never
bulked big on the executive side of cricket. His
neutrality was perhaps the reason he was chosen, in
view of the open faction fight between North and
South interests.
Club cricket in Adelaide furnished a sur-
prise in the last round, when University (Alexander,
McKay, Walsh) just pipped Sturt (Vic Richardson,
Scott, Gould, Townsend) for top place on the list,
17 points to 16. Till Christmas, Sturt won every-
thing, but its final score is 6 won, 2 lost, 1 drawn;
whereas the students, starting slowly but improving
all the time, had 6 won, 1 lost, 2 drawn. The two
Pellews, striking something of their old form towards
the end, helped to put North Adelaide third, and
Adelaide (which will have to play the final round
without Orimmett) just beat the Colts by a shade of
average for fourth place.

“Bouragi” : According to Hubert Murray,
football is becoming popular among the Binandale
tribes of Papua, the Northern Division now boast-
ing several teams at the various Government stations
and missions. The game played is Soccer, which is
regarded as more suited to the native temperament
than Rugby. As an old Soccer player, I am
inclined to doubt it. Though the northerners hare
nothing resembling a game of their own, like the
hockey of some Gulf tribes, they have shown an
aptitude for cricket, like most Papuans. Boxing
they never seemed to care for. One of the Anglican
missionaries on the Mamba tried to popularise it
a generation or so ago, but it fell flat on the un-
civilised citizens of the locality. However, if the
feeling for footer grows, we may yet receive a visit
in Australia from an All Cannibals team, as fore-
casted by a Bulletin paragraphist some months ago.
THE DISTINCTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Kelleway, acknowledging a presentation from the
Gordon club prior to his departure for England as
a press correspondent, said that he intended to criti-
cise the play rather than the players.”
Your feats to record,
My comrades, I come
On the velvety sward
And the wicket that’s plumb—
But not arma virumque exactly; I aim to leave out
the virum.
I shall follow the ball
Wheresoe’er it flies
In cuts that enthial
Or snicks that surprise,
But the bloke with the bat who propels it will be
a small thing in my eyes.
There’ll be eulogy rich
To bo duly assigned
To the spin and the pitch
The wickets that find,
Without more than a cursory mention of the arms
those achievements behind.
The catches that end
An innings, or stem
Reverse, I’ll commend
And the misses condemn,
But the fieldsmen who shine or who butter no ink
will have wasted on them.
To the ends of the earth
They’ll cable my screeds
With their tributes to worth
And the skill that succeeds,
But while others may write of the doers I’m simply
concerned with the deeds.
The distinction is fine,
Perhaps you will say,
But this is my line,
Nor from it I'll stray:
To stick to the play of the players, ignoring the
players that play.

THE INKY WAY.
In “Old Pink ’Un Days,” a racy book of
reminiscences mostly dealing with the London
Sporting Times, J. B. Booth has some
stories about Phil May. In his Bulletin
days the artist is represented as having taken
infinite pains to secure first-hand studies of
his subjects, and his interest in the Aus-
tralian abo. often led him out to La Perouse.
One day while recording in charcoal the
charms of a bevy of gins, more or less in
the altogether, he was interrupted by an
elderly white couple who did a little quiet
charity work. While the husband conversed
with May the scandalised wife hustled the
dusky females to their huts. Presently May
complained of the disappearance of his
models, whereupon the old chap sang out:
“Charity, Mr. May wants his gins.” The
ladies re-emerged clad from neck to ankle in
old print gowns. “Good God!” ejaculated
May. “Your wife is well named; Charity
has covered a multitude of gins.”
“Rizzle”: In the early days of the war,
Happy Jack Seaddan, then Labor Premier
of W.A., was so overwhelmed with deficit
that he conceived the idea of inflicting a
super-tax on the incomes of affluent citizens.
I was running a newspaper in the wheat
belt, and the morning after we notified our
readers of Happy Jack’s latest device for
raising the wind, an enraged agriculturist
forced his way into the editorial office and
concluded a blistering tirade on the new
impost as follows: “Yas, a damn Labor man
who ain’t got any land and never likerly to
’ave none, taxing our super! Why, as it is
we can’t buy enough for our farms, and what
the railways deliver is sodden wet. Super
tax! It’ll be a seed-wheat tax next.”
E. J. Brady, maker of sailors’ chanties,
who got his first inspiration while timekeep-
ing on Melbourne wharves in the days when
the sailing-ship was not the shy bird she is
to-day, keeps the atmosphere of the sea about
him at Mallaeoota Inlet, the Victorian
beauty spot near the N.S.W. border, where
he receives a varied mail. John Masefield,
who wrote that modern epic of the sea,
“Dauber,” is an admirer of the Australian’s
E. J. BRADY, bush bard and sea songster.
strong sea-verses in Tite Bulletin, and
writes often. Lately odd orders on the Brit-
ish Post Office for small amounts have flut-
tered into Brady’s bag, and he has been
unable to discover which of his books was
responsible for the largesse. lie has finally
come to the conclusion, from circumstantial
evidence, that some composer, name un-
known, has been setting his verses to music,
and that the English broadcasting stations
have been using them. Although royalties
are small, the English law is evidently more
firmly on the author’s side than it is in
Australia.
“Ilaka”: The philologists are all wrong
about the derivation of “wowser.” It is
an adaptation of the word “vowzher” (pro-
nounced vowser). The vowzhers lived in
Cromwell’s England. They were of Puritan
stock, and so called after their founder,
Adolph Vowzher. When some modern mem-
bers of the old sect landed in Australia, their
keyhole tactics brought them into a Sydney
court. The beak asked, “Are not these
people of some religious order?” and a news-
paper of the period reports that the police
sergeant replied, “Yes, they’re wowsers, your
Worship.” Then and there the name came
into our currency—long before John Norton
ever used it.
There will still be some old Bulletin
readers who remember Dr. Mannington
Caffyn's short stories. His wife, however,
won more fame with her “Yellow Aster,” the
most-discussed book of its day. Nothing
had been heard of them for years—they had
long left Australia —until word arrived a
week or so back that the lady had died in
England.

say, but some of the methods employed by
the’intruder to advertise itself are at least
original. The facade of the Flinders-street
building is decorated with a series of slogans
which have made Railway-Commissioner
Clapp turn green with envy. “There is no
Poison in the Post" is a fair sample. Halt
the main entrance to the building is occu-
pied by a sentrv-box with a half-door in
front. ‘ Behind ‘sits a youngster with re-
markable lung capacity, armed with copies
of the Post, and it takes an Aberdonian-
bred Armenian to get by him without spend-
ing a penny. A flying patrol, based in tin
box, harries the passing throng with appa-
rently equal success. The Post is a ‘coun-
try paper,” and has evidently borrowed this
idea from the barkers and “pull-ins of the
Dog Flat Show’s side-gaifs.

This country’s besetting vice is being
treated from two different angles at two
separate addresses in Melbourne. The dis-
play provided by the Rev. Worrall at the
Methodist Conference is not wanting in dra-
matic quality, but lacks the true spirit of
comedy, except of the unconscious variety.
It has drawn poor houses. lan Hay, in
"The Sport of Kings,” at the Athenaeum,
although at times giving rein to a spirit of
deplorable levity, shows a larger humanity
and a wider knowledge of human psychology ;
his play should continue to attract atten-
tion while there is a punter or a philosopher
of the humanities left in the land.
* * * *
The piece, truthfully described as a farce-
comedy, opens in the refreshment tent at
an English suburban race-nfeeting, with
Algernon Sprigge and Sir Reginald Toothill,
Bart., discussing, in a sadly irresponsible
manner, the prevalence of the gambling in-
stinct. Algernon is so convinced of its uni-
versal urge that he wagers with his repre-
hensible companion that he can make Amos
Purdie, J.P., a country magnate of impec-
cable self-righteousness, back his fancy in
some race or other within a week. Insinuat-
“HINDLE WAKES,” AT THE QUEEN’S
HALL, MELBOURNE.

ing himself with his colleague as a boarder
into the household of the magnate-—unfortu-
nately situated alongside a provincial race-
course—Algernon wins his wager in about
five minutes, the probabilities being stamped
on by the hoof of gay unreason somewhat
roughly for the purpose. Having found the
banana-skin of temptation, the J.P.’s descent
to the pavement of utter depravity is rapid.
He proceeds to lay bets by telephone and
telegram, but as he harbors the belief that
‘TOO each way” signifies that he has backed
his fancy to win or lose, his new enterprise
is not attended with conspicuous success.
Eventually he loses several thousands. His
endeavors to conceal his operations provide
his family and the servants with matter for
amusement, since, with the exception of the
wife, they are all engaged surreptitiously in
the same pastime. The probabilities are once
more given the happy despatch to enable the
magnate to go disguised as a MacShortodds
to the neighboring course and be rescued
from the pond into which indignant punters
have cast him by Algernon, the cause of all
the mischief. The harlequinade comes to a
graceful conclusion when it is discovered
that the backslider’s wife, in ordering coals
from London, has inadvertently given the
code-name for one of the day’s winners to a
turf agent, and the magnate is thus recouped
for all his losses. A very intermittent love
affair between Algernon and the J.P.’s sten-
ographer is hereupon brought to a just con-
clusion.
* * * *
The best acting was to be found in an
obscure corner. Henrietta Cavendish etched
the character of the timid Mrs. I’urdie in
quiet, effective lines.. The punting baronet
was humorously portrayed by Bert Randall,
but Joseph Cunningham’s Algernon Sprigge
cut the same noisy capers in the lists of love
as in the saddling-paddock. Zillah Bateman,
who has been here before with G. B. Post,
gives the social writers material for half a
column with dresses of great splendor but
somewhat out of place on the back of a
poverty-stricken typist. In addition she
offers a nice figure, a wide, embracing smile
and the whites of her eyes in compensation
for a somewhat slender histrionic outfit and
a rather skimpy love-affair. All the richness
of the play is poured out over the farcical
characters, the pious Mr. Purdie (excellently
drawn by Frank Bradley), his daughter
(done promisingly by Ceridwen Kelly, late
of Melbourne Repertory circles), and the
cook. Although the programme stated that
Renee Glynne was the cook, this commentator
had doubts about the moving mountain being
really human. H. Lane-Bayliff butlered
competently, and George Walker, as a police-
sergeant, followed the highest traditions of
dramatic art at some distance. There is
plenty of robust farce and genuine good
comedy in the stew.
** * *
Again last week Beresford Fowler and
his corps of amateurs gave a very mixed
display at the Queen’s Hall, Melbourne. On
Monday they were gloomily metaphysical
over irrational tragedy of “The Master
Builder.” Beresford Fowler did nothing to
lift the weight of dulness laid by the play-
wright on the breast of Halvard Solness. The
mad contractor, who first builds churches with
tall steeples he is afraid to climb, afterwards
expresses his revolt against high Heaven and
architectural propriety by erecting the same
emblems on suburban bungalows, and finally
breaks his neck by falling off one, evokes no
sympathy; and if Ibsen had also consented
to bury Aline Solness, the fellow’s unhappy
wife, before the play began, the audience
would cheerfully have paid the funeral ex-
penses and sent along a wreath as well.
Ruth Conabere, an actress of address, made
Hilda Wangel, the fresh young girl who
allows herself to be so strangely mesmerised
by the builder’s steeple-climbing habits, a
reasonable creature; but the flounderings of
the rest in the quagmire of Scandinavian
mysticism was not the right sort of spectacle
for this warm weather. Shaw’s “Candida”
on Wednesday, however, provided a mainly
new cast with an immensely better oppor-
tunity, of which they took excellent advan-
tage. Dulcie Bland’s conception of the par-
son s omniscient wife was light, happy and
unselfconscious; Harold Harwood was ad-
equate as the parson ; Beresford Fowler was
a suitably vulgar Burgess, and Eric Donald
succeeded in arousing interest in the way-
ward aspirations of the philandering poet,
Eugene Marchbanks. The curtain-raiser,
‘ln the Darkness,” was well handled.
* * * SH
Ibsen’s domestic tract, “A Doll’s House,”
was nicely played in parts, and in others
only read, by Beresford Fowler’s Little Art
Co. at Melbourne Queen’s Hall on Saturday.
Ihe role of Torvald Helmer was a strait
waistcoat on the frame of Bruce Henderson,
but some effective diction came from Lucy
Ahon, as his wife, and still better from Beat-
rice Ternan, as Mrs. Linde. Beresford
fowler clothed Nils Ivrogstad in some degree
of truth, together with extraordinary
trousers.
** * *
Minns goes to Melbourne:—
B. E. Minns, of Sydney, has launched himself
upon the Melbourne public with a selection of water-
colois, some of which are very good and others below
his level of achievement. A fine example of his
dramatic handling of the bush is No. 15,' “Noonday
Rest.” An enchanting thing, this, in which the
overloaded buggy at rest and the road melting in
blue haze are equally alive. No. 13 is a rich, sug-
gestive gumtree decoration in the fashion of Syd Long,
and No. 27 well portrays the realistic muddle of
the secondary bush; but in Nos. 6 and 21 he has
not succeeded in pulling Sydney together into any-
thing intelligible, and in the right-hand corner of
No. 14 he has dodged many problems of tone. There
are other compositions which have been seen with a
hesitating eye and set down with a too easily satisfied
brush. The Minns color, however, is, as always, as
refreshing to the sight as an iced balloon-shandy to
a firefighter. All around him in his home on the
North Shore line the artist has concrete evidence to
confute the Meldrum doctrine that Nature painted
the bush in hues of mud ; and some of the evidence
is recorded in this show at the Fine Art Gallery.

Peripatetic art: — c
It takes all sorts of people to make the tourist
world. There is the traveller who couldn’t remember
whether he had been to Rome because his wife bought
all the tickets; and there are the Misses Cusack.
These two Sydney ladies, whose- show of oils and
waters is at the Melbourne Athenaeum, have been
everywhere and looked at everything. They have
been to Ospedaletti and Mew Forest, wherever that
may be; and the typesetter has sent them to Grosse
as well as Grasse. And they have been vastly enter-
tained by what they saw and have insisted on
putting it all on paper. Their enthusiasm (alas!)
was a trifle greater than their art, and the result
of their industry is a travelogue of tinted drawings
whose conception is more courageous than the execu-
tion. Polperro, Cornwall, is seen threatened by a
tidal wave which the cableman forgot to report;
and St. Mark’s, Venice, is tossing in the throes of
an earthquake about which the seismographs were
silent. When the ladies’ hands are not set trembling
by the glamor of foreign parts they do better. The
home-staying waratah, epacris and wattle are accept-
ably portrayed.

At Melbourne Tivoli this week the Aerial
Benos are inviting a call from the under-
taker on the high trapeze, four horseshoes on
the carpet underneath their whirling forms
being all that stands between them and de-
struction. Local artists who complain of a
lack of public interest in their shows should
tear a leaf out of the book of Ralph Holbein,
who draws beer-barrels which provide a flow
of beer, and cigar-boxes which prove to be
full of Coronas; The three Swifts are jug-
gling clubs with the artlessness that con-
ceals art, and Inly Morris is robustly sing-
ing her matrimonial ads. The White Aus-
tralian audience shows more charity than
justice in warmly applauding Ben Nee One,
for whose weak voice even the light num-
bers of his repertoire are a burden. Rupert
Hazel is a distinctly funny curate, and Nellie
Harmston’s cockatoos are intelligent enough
to earn a leaving-certificate from any Gov-
ernment school-inspector. Ella Shields looked
in again on Monday and found, as usual,
welcome on the mat.
** * *
Two servings of adventure richly gravied
with romantic love are being handed round
at Hoyt’s (Melbourne). They are “Wild
Horse Mesa,” a Zane Grey shocker, and
“Rugged Water,” a sea epic in which Walter
Beery does all that could possibly be required
of a gentleman with such a cheering name.
A strange device is to be seen at the Majes-
tic in a picture called “Love’s Bargain.” A
titanic typewriter is presented, each of whose
48 keys is a charming girl who by bowing
her head prints her appropriate letter and
helps to spell out the name of the master-
piece. The other picture is a dramatic ren-
dering of present-day monetary problems in
\ Jenna, where foreign tourists can enjoy
a luxurious holiday and, by profiting on ex-
cnange, leave the country with more money
than they brought into it, followed by the
grateful salaams of the starving inhabitants.

would be unfair to describe “Kangaroo
i lat, winch opened at the Sydney Palace
(?, n k, atur day night, as imitative of Steele
laidd s moneymaker. The comedy conception
0t Australian country life has settled into
well-defined grooves, and the backbone of
melodrama upon which the comedy is built
(including, of course, the wicked squatter,
the adventuress from Sydney, the irascible
pioneer who is “Dad,” the stalwart Aus-
tralian bushman, the noble Australian girl
he loves, and the rest of them) present a
family likeness in all these plays. Tal Ordell
has produced a comedy-drama which ripples
without some of the extravagances of
On Our Selection”; there is swift action
and a passable, straightforward story, and
the comedy-dramatic denouement of the last
act is well worked.
* * * #
Although a hasty judgment might call it
a caricature, blokes like Tal Ordell’s Jimmy
Cork may be met in Surry Hills or Cow Flat,
on “the hill" at the Cricket Ground or at
an agricultural show. The representation
provides the bulk of the comedy. C. R. Stan-
ford’s Dad, John Manson, is built too much
Upon the lines Bert Bailey has made familiar.
The most polished work is that of Hilda
Dorrington, the rather good-natured adven-
turess whose mission in life is to extract
money wherever the chance offers. Carl
Lawson makes a tolerable villain, and Ed-
ward Landor supplies brisk broad comedy
as the cow-doctor, Professor Bopp. Beryl
Barraclough is too prone to chirrup her
words; Eileen Alexander, -who played the
sweet girl heroine in “On Our Selection,"
has the same fault, otherwise she is pleasing
as Nell Manson. . Bob Ashley is a robust but
slightly mechanical lover; and humorous
trimmings are provided by Norman Carter
(the jackeroo who becomes a lord) and
Royston Brown; while Helen Johnson and
Helen Burton supply a comparison of the
short and tubby with the tall and lean which
add humor to several stage pictures. Mar-
cia Roberts shows an inclination to shout
in order to express the flamboyancy of flap-
perliood in a “straight soubrette” part.

On Tuesday next the 100th performance

“White Cargo” is still delivered nightly
at the Theatre Royal. The stage atmosphere
is so realistic that a dear old lady in the
d.c. sighed audibly the other night when
the curtain went down on a bunch of people
industriously mopping the sweat from then-
faces and bodies with discolored handker-
chiefs. “Remind me,” she enjoined her com-
panion, “to send my nephew Jack in Papua

vests.”

Jim Gerald has made a selection from all
the Digger humors of the war and jumbled
it into a hilarity which he calls “1914-1918.”
The rehash at Fuller’s Theatre especially
appeals to the Diggers in the audiences. Con-
nors, and Paul and Huley and Bent have
made a reappearance; and the Huntings con-
tinue to juggle with many things, including

in sales.
To-day’s Essex is the finest ever built. It is the smoothest,
most reliable Essex ever built. It is the best-looking, most
comfortably-riding Essex ever built, and the price,
because of volume, is little more than low-priced Fours.
And with its low first cost and operating economies, you
get the long-lasting, reliable performance, smoothness and
riding ease of the most wanted “Six’’ type in the world.

Essex is nimble of action. It is easily handled
in traffic, responsive to every call for power
or speed.
The Coach has long been acknowledged the
“World’s Greatest Value,’’ because of its
utility, closed car comforts and price advan-
tage. With Essex among low-priced cars
and the Hudson Super-Six in the moderate-
priced field, its supremacy of value has
never been so outstanding as to-day.

A milk-and-water-color exhibition :
There are 150 exhibits at the show' of the Austra-
lian Water-color Institute in the Education Depart-
ment gallery, Sydney. For the most part, it is an ex-
hibition by artists who have struck good commercial
lines and turn out pretty pictures to please purchasers.
One of the few gleams of imagination is in B. E.
Minus’s “'The Crest,” where a group of mounted
gallants in mediaeval millinery gaze from a height
at a land of future adventure. “The Crest,” one
of six paintings by the same artist, suggests power
and adventure. Blamire Young’s “The Archway”
(No. 25) is a better picture than “The Flying Dutch-
man” (No. 23), in which, from their own ship’s
deck, the vivid figures of the astonished living stare
against the background of the ghost-ship’s' shadowy
sails and prow. Napier Waller, who lost his right
arm in the war, has three phantasies conceived in
his usual strong, decorative style. “The Labyrinth”
(No. 31) shows a knight riding through a broken,
deserted citadel on a tired horse; the sense of im-
pending danger is skilfully conveyed. Green light
and palliditv are well expressed in “The City of the
Sea ; but the human denizens of the sea are obviously
fishlike in their emotions. If the late J. J. Hilder’s
“A Morning Ride,” a characteristic landscape but
not of his best, is really worth the scheduled price
of 250 guineas, it provokes a regret that artists can’t
live to enjoy the prices they may command after they
are dead. J. R. Eldershaw helps the onlooker to
feel the sunlight in “Morning Shadows” (No. 16)
and “The Old Colonial Barn” (No. 20) ; S. J.
Lamoma Birch has done good work in a group of
pictures of which “King Charles’ Castle, Salcombe”
(No. 106) is the most striking; G. C. Benson puts
spaciousness into “In the Hills” (No. 75) ; H. Sep-
timus Power shows “Harrowing” (No. 90), and seve-
ral other pictures with horses—some of them very tired
horses; Carlyle Brown evidently felt the surge of
some patriotic feeling when he painted “The Strong
Brown Land” ; and Henry Fullwood, R. W. Sturgess,
Albert Collins, Gladys Owen, Keith Harris, C. E. S.'
Tindall, R. Fizelle, J. Llewellyn Jones, Harold Her-
bert, John D. Moore (whose garish experiments in
paint go nearest success in “Shearing Shed, Glanmire,
N.S.W.”), Kenneth Macqueen, Charles Condor, Adel-
aide Perry (who provides some grotesque perspec-
tives), John Banks and Thea Proctor are amongst
the contributors.

“Are You a Mason?” is in its fourth
crowded week at the Grand Opera House.
Cheap prices, and the public is getting lots
of laughter for its money.
$' $ # $
Ye Olde Minstrel Show has vanished from
the Tivoli, but The Big Four and Quintrell’s
Ten Royal Spanish Syneopaters remain with
the burnt cork rubbed off. The ten good
Australians who are in Quintrell’s show have
apparently been given the title “Spanish” to
explain their costumes. The Sinclair Brothers
give a new turn to acrobatics by using
dinner-suits and quiet methods for their
strenuous deeds; Fransky still earns ap-
plause for his comedy dances, but Albright
fails to improve on further acquaintance:
there are lengthy spasms of monotony in his
conversations with his stage-assistants. The
likeable Katrina and Joan have been pressed
to stay a little longer, but are due to dance
themselves away directly something to take
their place is discovered; and the Karreys
are as amazing as ever.
** * *
A cut above the ordinary fillum is “A
Beggar on Horseback,” presented at Hoyt’s
this week in company with “The Golden
Strain.” It shows the workings of the mind,
conscious and sub-conscious. With the fourth
reel comes a dream-story, with all the im-
pressions of the occurrences of the day
worked into its phantasies, and packed with
the mad humors of Dreamland. The Lyceum
has resumed business with Louise Lovely’s
Australian-made picture, “Jewelled Nights,”
which displays Tasmanian scenery effectively
and osmiridium mining no more preposter-
ously than is to be expected. The late Arthur
Styan made one of his last appearances in
this screen-story. “Kiss Me Again” is a
lightly-constructed and enjoyable adaptation
of a E rencli play. “The Iron Horse” pur-
sues its way at the Prince Edward.
** * *
Times change. When Brough and Bouci-
cault played “The School for Scandal” in
Adelaide 00-odd years ago, sundry indignant
matrons marched out to show their dis-
approval of the classic. The present re-
vival at the Prince of Wales is accepted a?
an educational necessity, and parties are
sent to it from the Methodist and Presby-
terian girls’ colleges. Allan Wilkie is a sound
Sir Peter, his wife is especially good in the
screen scene, and the support is clever. The
Royal is just re-opening with pantomime;
Jennie Benson, principal boy, and Bruce
Green, the Dame. Pictures are rather un-
usual The York has Gloria Swanson calling
Napoleon to order, as “Madame Sans Gene.”
and Wondergrapli also goes to France for a
spectacular showing of the Weyman novel
of Richelieu’s day, “Under the Red Robe.”
West’s has a new version of the old Drury-
lanc success, “Sporting Life.” and the Pa'v
shows some realistic fire-fighting in aii
American city.
Poverty
Point
“Cmsar’s Ghost”: “Kangaroo Flat” brings
back to Sydney boards two old-timers in
O. R. Stanford and Ida Gresham, who used
to barrow the feelings of the crowd in the
days when melodrama was ripe and meaty.
Stanford for a time was stage-manager for
Julius Kniglit, but he was far better known
as villain in Andersonian melodramas. The
hatred of villainy displayed in the theatre
did not always stay there. Once, intending
to board privately instead of going to a hotel,
Stanford was broaching the subject of accom-
modation to a wide-eyed, staring slavey, when
the door slammed sharply in his face. “I
know you!” breathed the excited female’s
voice through the keyhole. “You’re the man
who deserts his wife, at Anderson’s! We
don’t want your sort here!”
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : In drab Floral-street,
which runs by the side entrance to Covent
Garden, there has been opened in a barn-
like apartment up a creaking stairs the Gate
Theatre Salon. Despite its poverty-stricken
environment the salon is housing representa-
tions of notable plays— Ibsen, Mase-
field, Pirandella, Strindberg, Tchekhov and
O’Neill are on the list—and the impersonators
are all professionals. George Kaiser’s “From
Morn to Midnight” was very well done, an
especially fine job being made of the stadium
scene, although the stadium was only eight
feet square. Each play is set for a two-
weeks’ run, and for 2s. Sd. you can get a
back seat for two productions. If such a
venture can succeed in England and it
looks like succeeding—why shouldn’t it be
attempted in Sydney or Melbourne?
“Frinigga”: Tired of being blamed all
the time for morbid realism, Eugene O’Neill
has produced an idyllic and dreamy sort of
play on a famous American legend, the
quest of the Spaniard Ponce de Leon for a
fountain of Youth in Florida or there-
abouts. And now the critics—just like them !
are saying that O’Neill had better stay
morbidly realistic.
“FY7”: The controversy as to the best
burnt-cork artist recalls Ilosea Easton, a
contemporary of Horace Bent (B. 18/2 /’26),
and like him, a member of “Colonel”
Hicks s minstrel co. That crowd, or
some of it, went on the rocks in Brisbane
at the start of the ’nineties, and scratched
out a precarious living for a bit at the old
Gaiety Theatre in Adelaide-street. Hosea,
a tall, decent mulatto, was not only a clink-
mg good corner-man, with all the usual
accomplishments, but he had a really fine
bass voice, and was one of the best banjo-
players the writer has heard.
Curtain-raiser : Those heart-throbs of
the music-halls depend for the emotions they
evoke on the people who sing them. Weep
over this one:—
Why am I always a bridesmaid ?
Never a blushing bride?
Ding, dong, wedding bells,
Only ring for others.
One fine day—
Oh ! Let it be soon—
I shall wake up in the morning
On my own honeymoon!
And then hear Lily Morris, of the Tivoli
circuit, sing it!
“F.S.”: According to J.C.W.’s inspired
propagandist, when Pavlova arrives at Ilis
Majesty s, Melbourne, for the first time, she
will be carried over the step of the stage-
door, this being always done when the dancer
appears for the first time in a new city. I
am not sure where Pavlova got her belief
or superstition, but she certainly did not in-
vent it. In Java the haji returning from
Mecca is always lifted over his threshold,
the notion being that if he touches it with
liis feet his newly-acquired holiness would
be left standing on the mat. A fresh door
used to be broken through the wall at one
time, but this was found expensive. In
Russia, where Pav. comes from, it is the
custom to electrify the doorstep with suit-
able charms, in order to repel the spirits of
t>i S i. since the inauguration of the
Bolshevik regime, are said to outnumber the
living in that country. In the lack of an
official statement I take it that the light-
some lady reasons thus: Being unable to dis-
criminate between good and evil, the door-
step at His Majesty’s might depolarise the
spirit of the dance resident in her heels.
“Hamfat”: “The man who swatted an ele-
phant” is still extant in Sydney; he is now
a stage-hand, with most of his glory for-
gotten. He was with Fitzgeralds’ Circus
when one of the elephants died, and it was
the way he commenced his explanation at
the circus inquest that earned him his title.
‘ You see, I got tired of swatting mosquitoes,
so I he began. What he was trying to
explain when the laugh interrupted him was
that he had bought a bottle of anti-skeeter
stuff which Jumbo, coming upon it uncorked,
poured into his in’ards, greatly to the detri-
ment of the big beast.
“Westerner”: One St. Patrick’s night in
Perth I went with O’Mulligan to see
Tittell Brune as Camille. The house was
booked out, and we had to bribe our way
to decent seats. O’Mulligan didn’t think
he was getting the worth of his money, and
grumbled all through the play. “Call her an
actress!” he said. “She can’t act for nuts.”
Outside, after the show, O’Mulligan was still
holding forth on the star’s alleged short-
comings as an actress when Tittell came out.
She was wrapped up in furs and had a big
bunch of shamrocks on her breast. “Do
ye see that now!” cried O’Mulligan, staring.
‘ She s wearing shamrocks! A good little
woman; a good little woman ; and a gr-rand
actress!”
“Strict Veg.”: If somebody with a weak
heart isn’t carried out feet first from the
stalls of Melbourne Tivoli one of these after-
noons or evenings it won’t be the fault of
the Aerial Benos. The male half of this
turn swings himself, reversed, from a trapeze
hooked on to the roof of the auditorium
while the female half oscillates like a glitter-
ing silver pendulum, from a rope fastened to
nis wrist, over the heads of as many of the
stallites as have decided to stick it out. Sud-
denly, with a loud report, the rope frays
out and breaks, and nine stone of loveliness
hurtles downwards in a beeline for the bald
head of the pawnbroker sitting 11 rows back
from the front. The nice girl on my right
clutches my arm and says “Oo,” and the
Digger on my left says “Stretcher-bearers at
the when the reckless creature is seen
to be gently swinging to and fro on the
tatters of the cord a few feet above the crowd.
1, P e °P^ e t° have their fun, but until
the Aerial B.’s pass on d.c. seats will do for
me and my girl friend.
. Blum”: Guy Bates Post has been giving
Maonland liis views about the drama,
ancient and modern. lie deplores the ten-
dency of Brieux, Sudermann and Hauptmann
to ‘rake things over as they do.” Most
improper, according to Mr. Post. Ibsen
should be read but not played, and Shakspeare
is finished so far as the stage is concerned,
whereupon Mr. Post proceeded to the local
lheatre Royal, there to give an imitation of
the antics of a dope-addict deprived of his
drug, the performance being part of a play
based upon the original idea of two men so
much alike that they might be mistaken for
each other.
‘‘Nero”: With all due deference to “E.G.”
(B. 25/2/’26), “Reno” was not so entirely
wrong in stating that Sally Booth and Ada
Lee were members of Charles Arnold’s co.
when they fell victims to the plague in 1902.
They both played in “Why Smith Left
Home at the Palace on February 12, 1902,
when Charles Arnold gave his farewell per-
formance in Sydney. Within a fortnight
both_ were battling with the disease which
carried them off. Sally died on February
27; Ada on March 2.

A Lister Engine is an Investment. After many
years of work it will sell for four-fifths of its
original cost!
Like a “Rolls Royce Chassis” or a “Purdey
Gun” the annual wear and depreciation of a
Lister Engine is hardly noticeable!
Compare a Lister Engine purchased I 5 years
ago with a foreign-made Engine purchased at the
same time.
The Lister will be still as good and working
as well as the day it started up —the foreigner will
have worn out years ago and ceased to exist!
The All-British Lister stands for Real Value, Durability, Satis-
faction, Low Upkeep, Greatest Possible Efficiency.

“Croson”: Came across a happily-named
Bang one blazing day lately when my mate
and I spilled into the Spring Vale Hotel.
Said Bill: “Struth, it’s hot! Give us two
pints,” and W. Struth, licensee, handed out
the required refreshment.
“Kir” : It was a recent Sabbath, and the
raucous-voiced orator in the Sydney Domain
was making desperate attempts to hold his
scanty audience by pulling out the pathetic
stop. “I was not always thus,” he told them
quaveringly. “When I first opened my eyes
in this dishonest world our family circum-
stances wrnre far better than that of most of
you to-day. Time was when I sought no
luxury but I obtained it; when I was accus-
tomed to pass this very spot in my own car-
riage, and my mother —bless her” “Used
to push it,” snapped an unsympathetic
listener.”
“H. J.K.”: There are fakers of antiques in
this country who have little to learn from
their European or American co-craftsmen.
There is an operator, known to some cabinet-
makers as a “paint-chemist,” who specialises-
in the production of stainings that go by
such names as “fumed oak,” “bog oak” and
the even more popular “Jacobean walnut.”
Ancient-looking wormholes, put in with a
jeweller’s drill, help the deception ; but the
lightness of these “antiques” generally gives
the game away. In house-fittings the colorist
is on safer ground. A bungalow recently
sold for £2700 was catalogued as being of
a “Jacobean interior” all stained kauri-
pine !

TO think that ordinary cuts, burns, scratches, etc.,
are of little account and to assume indifference
by allowing them to be neglected for days is always
unwise. The real danger of these troubles lies in
the breaking or damaging of the protective outer
skin and the laying bare of the sensitive flesh to
the poisonous influence of dirt and disease germs.
When an accident happens you need help
quickly and Zam-Buk is always the safest and most
reliable antiseptic first-aid to have handy. This
healing balm takes all immediate danger out of
minor skin injuries or wounds. It destroys disease
germs, draws off poisonous matter, soothes pain,
and quickly ends a peril which even healthy people
have to face.
Zam-Buk, the world-famous healer, costs you
little more than a box of ordinary ointment —it
gives twenty-fold in soothing, healing and antiseptic power. Whether
it is a cut hand, scratched arm, burned finger, sprain or open wound,
Zam-Buk ensures the utmost safety with clean, perfect healing.
Sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers, 1/6 and 3/6 per box.

“Clerk”: In response to requests from
some of Ills biggest customers, Commissioner
Clapp is introducing the c.o.d. system on
the Vic. railways. For a 24 per cent, com-
mission—minimum fee sixpence—Vic. firms
can now rail an unpaid-for parcel to a
customer in any part of the State and wait
comfortably for the s.m. at the addressee's
station to collect the cash and shoot it along.
This privilege does not apply to perishable
stuff or birds, and the value of any parcel
is limited to £5O, so that Clapp is not risking
a great deal. The system has been in use
on the Queensland and South Australian
railways for some time.

“Kriz” : Luggers working the shell beds out
of Broome (W.A.) raised 1075 tons of
mother o' pearl for the season 1025 which
closed with December. This is 175 tons less
than the 1924 season, and considering the
greater number of boats working, the total
is very poor. During the year the price
varied, sometimes being a very little over the
cost of production, but mostly well under it.
There was a very poor market for pea ls
and baroque, French buyers, the only ones
attracted lately, blaming the depressed franc
for the inadequate prices .offered and in
most cases refused. Meanwhile the cost of
production has been rising by leaps and
bounds, and it will not be long before
the small man—that is, the man with one
or two luggers—will be forced out of the
industry.

“Sucre”: With its legs wide apart and
the deep Dumaresq River slipping through
the gap, Gunyan (Q.) reckons itself capable
of .supplying Australian pipes with Aus-
tralian tobacco. Texas Estates, Ltd., the
present owners, are waiting for a promised
railway before throwing open thousands of
acres of tobacco land to selectors. Thirty
years ago the Queensland Government estab-
lished a State tobacco experimental farm
at Texas under the guidance of an American
named Tryon, but Federation reduced it to
waste and weeds. In those early days the
country from Warwick to Texas was a sea
of green tobacco plants, and Brisbane had
two tobacco factories—Cameron’s and Dix-
son’s. Bowen (N.Q.) grows some of the
finest tobacco leaf in the world, but few
seem to know about it.
“J.’s Ass”: The cash lawyer lias arrived

kept none, adding, “Mine is a cash business,

“J.T.D.” : Petty thieves operating on slot-
machines (B. 18/2/’2(>) had a long run in
Sydney, the chief sufferer being the A.G.L.
Co., whose gas-meters were assiduously
fished by anglers who baited their lines with
pennies. Finally the co. hit on the expedi-
ent of cutting a serrated edge at the end of
the slide, which prevented the withdrawal
of the coin. A Wexford-street Chinaman
proved too smart for them, however, and
baffled the authorities for years. His pak-a-
pu joint was a blaze of light every night,
and the meter showed such a poor dividend
that the inspector was impelled to investi-
gate. He failed to find sufficient evidence
to convict Ah Sin of unlawfully tampering
with the meter, and the business might have
remained a mystery had not the Chinaman
himself, after giving up business and just
before leaving for his homeland, disclosed
his method. It was as simple as all great
conceptions. Instead of a penny he had used
an accurately cut disc of ice, which evapor-
ated after doing its work and left no trace
in the machine.

“Jesmond” : Many of my clients run sea-
side and country guest-houses, and each loses
a few pounds a year through the non-arrival
of domestics after they have been engaged.
The office fee and railway fare come to about
255. per girl, and never less than three or
four girls fail to arrive at each house dur-
ing the season. Unfortunately the boarding-
house-keepers are not certain that the girls
have been engaged, and some of them have
the uncomfortable feeling that they arc being
rooked. Registry offices should have power to
issue railway warrants with the date and
stations specified. This would prevent a girl
pocketing the railway fare and forgetting
about the job, and it would prevent an un-
scrupulous agency pocketing the fare and the
fee for engaging a fictitious girl.

“Pigskin”: “Saddler Sim’s” experience
as a tradesman (B. 28/l/’26) cannot go
back further than 1914. Bag leather, i.e.,
cowhide, previous to that date was used only
in the cheapest saddles. The war made pig-
skin scarce and expensive, so the cheaper
cowhide came to be more generally used in
better saddles. Tom Watson, the racecourse
starter, is striding a pigskin saddle over 59
years old —no cowhide would last that long.

“Wang”: Our local council offered a bonus
of 3d. per head for rats; the Town Clerk
was expected to pay out the money to every
deliverer of the goods, being reimbursed
when he presented his book to the council.
One day a youngster arrived with a defunct
rodent, and as the t.c. was up to his eyes
in work a minor official, after a hurried
glance at the rat, told the bearer to pitch it
into the incinerator in the yard at the rear
of the Town Hall and come back for his
traybit. At odd times for several hours
afterwards juveniles appeared with a dead
rat, and were instructed where to warehouse
it prior to receiving the scalp-money. The
first kid reappeared full-handed several
times, and when congratulated on his luck
and civic spirit, grinned amiably through his
veneer of stickjaw. Late*Jn the afternoon
the Town Clerk came in. and after looking
over the list in the book the kids had to
sign for their traybits, reckoned he’d better
get rid of the rodents by fire. Ten minutes
later he came back and blasphemously an-
nounced that there was only one rat in the
incinerator. It had paid 12s. 6d. in divi-
dends. I know, because I was the official
who had handed out the dough.


PALMER RIVER GOLD CO
NO LIABILITY.
PALMER GOLDFIELD, N.Q.
Incorporated under the Companies Acts 1853-1913.
BUCKET DREDGING AND HYDRAULIC SLUICING.
Introduction.
Payable gold was first reported on the Palmer River by the well-known explorer
J. V. Mulligan in August, 1873.
A great rush of adventurers set in, and throughout the succeeding 20 years the main
stream and its numerous rich tributaries were worked extensively by Europeans and
Chinese.
The total output from this drainage system is variously estimated at 6 to 8 million
pounds sterling, of gold. A field which for many years was the foremost alluvial field of
Australia, and which produced by far the largest quantity of alluvial gold ever found
in Queensland, became eventually, through the depletion of the easily-obtained gold and
the remoteness of the field, abandoned; but now, with a railway part of the way and
motor-traction for the balance, is comparatively easy of access. The difficulty of the
trail in the early days from Cooktown, the port of the Palmer goldfield, is symbolised by
the name of such places as Hell’s Gate, where frequent attacks were made by the natives
on the passing diggers.
It is on official record that the working miner, with such primitive appliances as
the dish, cradle and sluice-box, obtained over 40 tons of gold from the river and its creeks.
Mr. Harry Harbord, now of Port Moresby (one of the best-known early pioneers of the
field), writes: “I and my mate in our first six weeks got 640 ounces, but plenty of men
got more. Billy McLeod opened up McLeod’s Gully and got 193 ounces the first week.”
Under these circumstances it was only reasonable to expect that areas of payable
alluvial ground would be found in the lower reaches of the river where heavy water
prevented the working of the drifts, and also on the higher terraces. The testing done
by the Palmer River Gold Company has shown this to be so, and valuable areas have
been secured.
The nature of the operations proposed, viz., bucket-dredging and hydraulic sluicing,
is such that, relative to the quantity of material treated, the amount of labor is small.
Before the recent testing undertaken by our general manager, Mr. Baker —whose
report is later given in detail —Mr. C. H. Wray, for many years examining expert for
Messrs. Bewick, Moreing & Co., and afterwards with Herbert C. Hoover, was engaged to
make a reconnaisance of the river, and in his report he strongly advised a systematic
testing.
Higlily-favorable reports were also secured made by Messrs. J. V. Mulligan and
H. H. Harbord, who agreed, from the prospectus that they got, that “nothing could be a
safer or more certain investment.”
Mr. David Morgan, well known as a mining manager in Victoria and Queensland,
prospected the river in 1904, and his conclusion, after sinking a number of trial shafts
and testing the river and its flats for a period of four months, was as follows: “I have
no hesitation in saying that the Palmer River is the best thing I know of—as you are
aware, I know of a good many. It trill prove the richest dredging ground in the Com-

Objects:
The Company having proved by boring on the Old Strathleven and Glenroy areas,
6.146,000 cubic yards of gravel of an average value of 1/1 per cubic yard, proving gold
to the value of £332,907, and a Bucket Dredge having been purchased and partly paid
for, and removal of same having been commenced, the present issue of 22,000 shares is
being made for the purpose of providing funds for the cost of the removal of the Dredge
from Cooktown (the nearest port to the Palmer River), purchase of Pontoon and cost
of transit of the Plant to the Dredging area and commencement of operations.
Further prospecting of the river is to be continued, probably enabling the formation
of subsidiary companies in which the parent company would retain substantial interests.
In support of the probability of further payable areas being located, it is pointed
out that Messrs. Mulligan and Ilarbord, in their report on this river, state that:—
“Miners with sluice boxes were making 2dwt. a day each in the river 40 miles
below the Company's dredging area.”
General Manager’s Report.
By Mr. WALTER BAKER,
Late Dredge Master, Manuka Dredging Co., N.Z.; Perseverance Dredging Co., Victoria;
Annan River Dredging Company, Queensland.
The Chairman and Board of Directors,
PALMER RIVER GOLD COMPANY, N.L.,
Cairns.
Gentlemen, —
Boring operations ceased on your areas on 15th October, 1925, after an uninterrupted period of
work commencing on 11th June, 1925.
The total footage sunk and proved is 2455 feet, at an average cost of 6/2 per foot, and you can
rpst assured that the values given will be found absolutely reliable when dredging operations commence.
In all, 149 holes have been put down, many of them being shafts to water-level, and the average cost
per hole is £5/1/6.
OLD STRATHLEVEN AREA (300 acres): On this area 77 bores were put down 100 feet apart, at
distances of 600 feet between the rows, approximately 120 acres of payable wash was proved, averaging
1/1 per cubic yard, proving 3,484,000 cubic yards of gravel suitable for bucket-dredging, the gold
contents of which can be valued at £188,716. The first 30 bores averaged 1/6 per cubic yard, and
Rome of the holes averaged as high as 3/4 and 4/2 per cubic yard to depths of 14 feet and 16 feet
respectively, showing that portion of the area contains very rich deposits of gold. The area is dredgeable
from bank to bank, and the material is all suitable for bucket-dredging, there being no stones of any
size worth mentioning, and the bottom is of soft granite, and the gold is of a nice shotty nature and
easily recoverable. There are several suitable sites on this area for launching the dredge. Consequently,
on completion of the above bores, I recommended you to secure your dredge.
GLENROY AREA (360 acres) : A total of 46 bores and shafts were put down, and approximately
150 acres were tested. The average gold contents were 1/1 per cubic yard, and approximately 2,662,000
cubic yards of gravel have been proved of this value. I do not consider this area suitable for a bucket-
dredge, but no doubt a suitable plant can be designed to recover the gold, which can be valued at
£144,191. (Note. —Messrs. F. IV. Payne & Son, dredge designers, of London, are now considering a suit-
able type of plant to recover the gold from this area.)
NEW STRATHLEVEN: This property is situated 10 miles below Old Strathleven, and an area of
200 acres has been secured. It is a very promising stretch of the river. Surface prospecting shows
from fine colors up to half-grain of gold to the dish. The area will average about 25 chains in width,
and is on surface indications in all respects similar to the area at Old Strathleven. The country is of
a chalky sandstone formation, and should be comparatively soft in the river-bed under the gravel
deposits, as is usual when this class of rock is met with, and I have no doubt the boring plant will
prove this to be so. This area can be bored next year when operations are resumed.
PLANT: The company’s boring plant is now stored at Strathleven Station in readiness for future
work.
ANNAN: The Annan River bucket-dredge that you have secured for £3OOO is practically a gift, as,
being at present at the port of Cooktown, it is more or less en route to the field. This dredge was only in
use 7 months, and cost in the region of £14,500 in Melbourne, exclusive of pontoon, and with slight altera-
tions and a new pontoon should be an ideal dredge for your requirements.
PALMER AREA (150 acres) : This has been acquired for sluicing purposes. The average height of
the ground above river-level, where the water would have to be pumped from, will not exceed 50 feet,
and the highest point will not exceed 70 feet, the bulk of the ground being about 55 feet. The whole
of this area can be sluiced by gravitation.
I have done a considerable amount of dish-prospecting over the whole of the area, and am satisfied
that the ground is worth between 1/6 and 2/- per cubic yard. The gold is of a very good class, coarse,
heavy and easily saved. The whole of the area consists of low, flat spurs and small, shallow gullies, and
gold is to be had from the grass-roots to the bottom.
I think 6 feet would be a fair average depth of the wash, which is all lying on a soft granite
bottom. The material varies from very coarse wash in places to very fine gravel in other parts. The
water-supply of the river would be sufficient to keen a plant working 7 months of the year. I would
recommend that this area be systematically prospected and proved, which could be economically done
whilst the wet season is on.
I feel satisfied that this area, if properly equipped and managed, will pay very handsomely.
IN CONCLUSION: The work carried out during the testing has proved that portions of the
Palmer River are eminently suitable for bucket-dredging, and sufficient ground has been proved to
warrant an immediate installation of a dredge. No doubt other payable areas will be located, but your
company has sufficient work in sight for at least 7 years at the Strathleven proved area, and in due
course the other areas mentioned in this report will be tested and, I feel sure, proved payable. I am
particularly pleased with prospects of the Bonanza sluicing area, and do not anticipate you will have
any difficulty in obtaining a suitable plant at a reasonable cost to treat this portion of your holdings.
Yours faithfully,
WALTER BAKER,
General Manager.
Directors’ Report.
PROPERTIES. For full particulars of the work carried out during the year 1925 you are referred
to Mr. Walter Baker's report appended.
The results of borings are as follow: — , , _ ,
OLD STRATHLEVEN AREA (300 acres) : 77 bores proved 3,484,000 yards of gravel of 1/1 per
cubic yard, representing recoverable value in gold of £188,716, area tested 120 acres.
GLENROY AREA (300 acres) : 40 bores proved 2,662,000 cubic yards of gravel of a value of 1/1 per
cubic vard, representing £144,191, area tested 150 acres.
NEW STRATHLEVEN (200 acres) : This area is in all respects similar to the Old Strathleven area,
and your General Manager anticipates it will bore similar values.
We propose boring this area in the New Year.
PALMERVILLE AREA (150 acres) : This area is taken up with a view to recovering the gold by
hydraulic sluicing. , , . , • „ . .. . ...
Your General Manager estimates, from the testing he has given it to date, that the values will
prove from 1/6 to 2/- per cubic yard. ... , ,„ ,
It is estimated that the cost of treating this material by hydraulic sluicing will not exceed Bd.
per cubic yard.
Our estimate of gold to lie won from this area is £150,000.
This area will lie' sampled as soon as the wet season commences.
MACHINERY. The Company has been fortunate in securing the Annan River Company s Bucket
Dredge for the sum of £3OOO. , . .
This dredge, which cost in the region of £14,500 at pre-war price in Melbourne, exclusive of the
Pontoon, is practically new ; it has been stored in Cooktown, and is about to be railed to Laura, and
can be removed from there to Strathleven, approximately 100 miles, by motor traction.
The purchase of the Pontoon is now being arranged.
To purchase a similar Dredge at after-war prices and land same at Cooktown would, we
estimate, have cost the Company in the region of £25,000.
FINANCE. At the date of the issue of this prospectus the Company has in hand and at early
call the sum of approximately £2OOO.
SHARE ISSUE. Upon the issue of 22,000 shares at 10/-, now under offer to the public, there will
be in circulation 65,000 shares as under: —
20,000 concession shares at 6/-, £6000; 22,000 shares at 10/-, £11,000; and 23,000 fully-paid-up
shares of 20/-, £23,000.
DREDGE OPERATION. The Dredge is capable of treating 55,000 cubic yards per month, but
allowing that an average of 40,000 cubic yards is maintained, and that 1/- per cubic yard is recovered,
and placing dredging costs at 6d. per cubic yard, a profit of £12,000 per annum should be made,
showing a profit of 30 per cent, on the £40,000' issued and paid-up capital.
This profit should be shown from the material proven on Old Strathleven alone for a period of
seven r ears.
STOCK EXCHANGE: The Company will be registered early this year on all the principal Stock
Exchanges of the Capital Cities of the Commonwealth.
IN CONCLUSION. It has been proved that the Strathleven areas are eminently suitable as Bucket
Dredging propositions, having a suitable bottom, easily treated gravel, coarse free gold easily saved, and
ideal localities for launching the Dredge, with unlimited water supply for dredging requirements, also
an average depth of wash most suitable to the plant purchased.
The success of the undertaking seems assured and the possibilities ahead enormous, as, apart from
the 200 acres held at New Strathleven, and the 150 acres at Palmcrville, and the 150 acres of proved
ground at Glenroy, there is every reason to believe that other payable areas will be located down the river
towards its junction with the Mitchell River, and once operations are established the further prospecting
of this famous old river will be carried on. For the Board of Directors,
ARTHUR 11. CLARKE,
POINTS WORTH NOTING BY INVESTORS.
Chairman.
1 That Mr. Baker, the Company's General Manager, has had 30 years’ practical dredging experience, and
that Messrs. C. H. Wray, David Morgan, J. V. Mulligan and H. 11. Harbord all reported
most favorably on the Palmer River as to its possibilities as a dredging proposition.
2 That the Vendors asked for no cash, being content to accept shares only.
3 That the Leases embrace ground on what has been one of the richest alluvial goldfields in Australia.
4 That over 40 tons of gold have already been won by working miners from the Palmer.
5 That the average value of all material tested, including over-burden where bottom was obtained, is
1/1 per cubic yard, and that higher values are likely to be obtained from the testing of the Palmer-
ville area.
6 That there is no other gold proposition in the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia that shows
such average values.
7 That the total cost of Dredging, allowing a fair margin for depreciation of plant, etc., is sd. per
yard, for safety’s sake, say 6d. per yard.
8 That less than one-third of total area embraced in Leases shows a profit of from £70,000 to £BO,OOO.
9 That allowing for the treatment of 40,000 yards per month with one dredge, it would show a profit
of £12,000 per annum (exclusive of profits from sluicing) for a period of 7 years from Old Strath-
leven alone.
10 That owing to the water facilities, cost of treatment is cheap.
11 That there is abundance of suitable timber for all requirements.
12 That there are no engineering difficulties in getting the necessary plant on the Leases, as modern
motor traction has made comparatively easy the accessibility of the Palmer.
13 That the climate is health,y. . . ,
14 That a suitable Bucket Dredge has been secured and partly paid for at the low price of WOW, ana
is now at Cooktown, the nearest port to the Palmer Goldfield. ...
15 That the prospecting of the river will be continued, probably enabling the formation of Subsidiary
Companies in which the Company would retain substantial interests whereby shareholders would
materially benefit. „ , . ~ .
16 That a Dredging plant working an area properly proven is always on pay ore, and has no Dianas.
17 That the Palmer River has never before been bored or methodically tested. ...
18 That shareholders taking up the new issue have the advantage of joining in a Company tnat nas
proven its areas, purchased and partly paid for its dredge and plant, which plant is now en route
to the field of operations.
Applications for shares will be received by the brokers to the company.

“Ex-Dig.” : Many moons ago my mention
of Sergeant Fred Miller (Ist Batt.) as a
much-shot Digger precipitated a discussion
as to the man whom the war left most like
a sieve. Miller got 37 distinct wounds from
a single burst of shrapnel, and, after being
given a few months tio live, completely
recovered, although his fine, athletic body pre-
sented a surface rather like the shell-hole
area round Hill 60. I can add a postscript.
Miller, who went away to S’Africa to take up
a job as instructor in physical culture, is
now the chief expert in that line in S’Africa
for the Y.M.O.A.
If the thrills of swordfishing in the Bay of
Islands don’t surfeit him, and time permits,
Zane Grey, the Yankee fictionist, will pene-
trate the w’apiti and moose country of Maori-
land for a crack at the big game. It was,
by the way. President Roosevelt who was
responsible for the introduction of these
animals to M.L. In 1905 the first wapiti
was received from him by the M.L. Govern-
ment, and 14 years ago the first herd of
moose, natives of Alaska, were donated. Both
wapiti and moose have thriven well, though
they are not numerous.
The Parliamentary dinner to Vic.’s depart-
ing Governor has been fixed for March 31.
His Ex. has opened six sessions since he
took hold in February, 1921, and has had
to do with six Governments. Of the six
Cabinets Lawson was at the head of three,
and Peacock, Prendergast and Allan each
had a turn. He has also had to treat with
two Assembly Speakers, Mackey and Bowser,
and two Upper House Presidents, Manifold
and Clarke. Irvine was in charge when the
Lawson-Allan Compo team camg into being,
but Stradbroke, returning from a holiday
abroad, gave it the happy despatch.
“Frizzledeggs”: The Y.M.C.A. hut which
I patronised on Salisbury Plain used to sell
stamps and other necessaries of life over the
counter on week-days; Sundays were set
apart for prayer meetings. I was kneeling
near the door at one of these services when
the door opened and a Digger’s head
appeared. “Hi, there,” he began to a chap
just behind me who sometimes gave them a
hand on the counter —“have you got any
stamps?” “Stamps, be ,” was the scorn-
ful answer; “can’t you see we’re praying?”
The train that runs between Hughcnden
and Winton (Q.) is driven by the Mayor of
Hughenden, Smacke McClean, a big chap
with a corresponding outlook on things
in general. Council meetings are usually
regulated by the railway timetable, for alder-
manic business couldn’t proceed in Hughen-
den rvliile Smacke was in Winton or some-
where on the road.
A German steel combine, in search of capi-
tal, offered £5,000,000 of 7 per cent, gold
bonds in Holland, the U.S. and Canada, and
each place snatched its share with eager-
ness. The idea of Canada having a trifle
of money to lend to Europe, while Australia
is always ready to borrow from all and sundry,
opens a new corridor of thought. Canada
buys less per inhabitant from abroad than
Australia does, and sells more (it even
exports paper, motor-cars, iron and steel and
rubber manufactures and leather), which goes
far to explain the possession of a little sur-
plus money. The importing shark hasn’t got
away with everything.
“Schnorrer”: A booklet by Charles Bertie,
of the Sydney Municipal Library, honors
“Australia’s First Composer,'’ Isaac Nathan.
Apart from his musical history he had an
interesting life. Intended for a rabbi, he
went to Cambridge, but music drew him, and
he studied under Corri. In 1813 he met
Byron, who had just published “The Bride
of Abydos” ; the composer’s musical setting
of some of the lines led to the introduction.
“Hebrew Melodies” followed during 1814-22.
Nathan wrote several books on music and
various operas, one at least of which,
“Sweethearts and Wives,” was popular. He
earned some celebrity outside of liis profes-
sion when, after giving evidence for Lady
Langford during a law case against Lord
Langford, he knocked the latter down. Also
he was unpopular with critics owing to his
habit of assailing them vehemently. It was
after losing several thousands on a “confi-
dential mission” for William IV., for which
lie got only a few hundred pounds (William
had meantime died), that he left his harass-
ing creditors and what remained of his
estate and made for Australia. He lived first
in Melbourne, but crossed over to Sydney,
where he reached a good old age.
Harry Holland, leader of the Labor group
in the Maoriland Parliament, who lately
hopped across the Tasman to have a look
at Sydney, was born somewhere near Can-
berra, and was printer’s devil on the Quean-
beyan Times. Fourteen years ago, being then
a fiery red-flag-wagger who had been gaoled
for his activities, he gave Australia best and
went to live in Maoriland. He soon got mixed
up in a watersiders’ strike and found his way
to prison again. The Big Scrap gave him an
opportunity to preach the wickedness *of
Avar, and when Paddy Webb, the member for
Grey, was gaoled for sedition, he won the seat.
Apart from a strain of pessimism that makes
him admire Russian methods of statecraft
and write dismal prose and mournful verse,
Harry Holland is all right. He is the stuff
of which martyrs are made —sincere, narrow-
minded and quite devoid of humor. If they
ever have a commune in Maoriland he will
be an early sacrifice to the guillotine, since
it is unthinkable that he will tamely submit
to the rule of any sort of government.
A Gawler (S.A.) married man, aged six
months short of 21, has been told by the
Law that it still regards him as an infant
and therefore unfit to buy a totalisator
ticket. He said that now he has an infant
of his own lie thought the legal disability
ought to cease, but the crime cost him £2
fine and £1 costs.
“Sparc Corporal”: They brought their grit
home with them. Captain John Bentley was
riding along a lonely road in the Taree dis-
trict (N.S.W.) when his motor-cycle jibbed
and gave him a broken leg. The Digger pain-
fully righted his machine, hoisted himself
into the seat, and sped, with one leg dangling,
to the nearest township, 10 miles away.

1. A delightful open , airy
car for fine weather.
2. Converted into a snug
weather-tight closed car
in 30 seconds.
3. Full protection against
cold or storm.
In Thirty Seconds!
Studebaker Duplex gives full protection
The Duplex body, designed and produced ex-
clusively by Studebaker, has completely revolu-
tionized the popular idea of what an open car
should be. Now an open car must retain its open
airiness and at the same time provide instant pro-
tection against wind and rain. The Studebaker
Duplex-Phaeton alone satisfies this dual desire.
In the Duplex, roller enclosures are concealed in
the side quarters of the superstructure. These
enclosures may be lowered in 30 seconds at the
will of the occupants just as a window shade is
lowered. Curtains on the Duplex are always at
your fingers’ tips.
By making all its own bodies, engines, axles,
clutches, steering gears, differentials, springs,
brakes, gear boxes, grey iron castings and drop
forgings, Studebaker eliminates extra profits
which all others (except Ford) must pay to out-
side parts and body makers. Thus Studebaker is
able to use finer materials and better workman-
ship, yet charge no more than competing cars.
Because all vital parts are designed and manufac-
tured under one supervision to constitute one har-
monious unit, every Studebaker functions a
unit. This insures years longer life, scores of
thousands of miles of excess transportation,
greater riding comfort, minimum repair costs,
and, finally, higher resale value.
Only Studebaker’s great financial and manufac-
turing resources make possible such fine cars at
such low prices.

Although it is lonely out there in
the back o’beyondyou wouldn’t
feel so “out of it ” if you had a Decca.
You could hear all the latest English
and American “hits ’ ’—all the world ’s
most famous artistes —all the most
popular dance tunes of the day.
The handy portable Decca was made
to accompany man into all the in-
accessible places of the earth. For
this reason it is staunch and sturdy
in build; its compactness is amaz-
ing, and yet its rich volume of pure
tone is as beautiful as that of the
most expensive models.
Include a Decca in your kit when
you go camping. You can carry it
with the utmost ease, for it is as
light and handy as an attache case.

A Ballad of a Wet Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY soul was like a lonely cow
That walks along a fence
And feels the barbs upon her brow
Of wires that warn her hence;
I knew the splendid grass inside
Was to my hunger still denied.
As thus in solemn mood I donned
My collar and my tie
I thought of lovely Rosamond
And heaved a weary sigh.
I went on foot beneath the stars;
Her father owned six motor-cars.
Miss Rosamond de Lacy Smith —-
To give her her full name —
Was like some creature from a myth.
Her hair was red as flame,
Her smiling face was lily-fair.
Her movements seemed all fire and air.
The moon was climbing up a tree,
The stars were in the sky,
The gracious night was warm and free;
And so I fixed my tie
And took a trip to Watson’s Bay
Where people jump to Heaven each day.
The eastern cliffs are like a trap
For weary hearts and sad;
Some tumble headlong from the Gap,
And people call them mad.
Yes, down they go by twos and threes
Their lonely, heedless wits to please.
I thought if I should jump to-night
That Rosamond might feel
How in that sudden, airy flight
I made my last appeal;
And so I wrote a note to say
“Dear Rosamond, keep sweet and gay.”
A little cloud came up and said
That other clouds were near ;
They came and gathered overhead.
The moon, no longer clear.
Dipped in and out of darkness bleak
As at a kind of hide-and-seek.
Before I got to Watson’s Bay
The night was wholly dark.
I heard the thunderous breakers play;
The cliff’s made no remark.
But on the fence I hung my coat
Pinned tightly to that fatal note.
'-’one saw me pass, none heard me go;
But as I neared the crag
Which might have ended all my woe,
My steps began to lag.
And suddenly I saw a shape
Outlined upon that rocky cape!
A woman’s form! I rushed to hold
Pier from tl.:. u purpose dread.
Mv hand just touched a garment’s fold
And through the dark she fled ;
And I, with nerves grown hard and tense,
Returning, chased her to the fence.
I missed her in that murky race,
But when I reached the road
I turned from such a useless chase
And towards the lamplight strode;
And there I saw a woman’s cape,
Black striped with green, my left-arm drape!
Heedless of rain, I paused to note
The fool that I had been.
Perhaps she had my fatal coat.
This foolish tiling of green
Would never shield me from the rain
Or do for wearing home again.
And then I saw the paper pinned
Where should have been her breast—
“ Forgive me, love, if I have sinned,
But I can know no rest.
Dear William John, I die forthwith;
Forgive your R. de Lacy Smith.”
What William John, since time began
Read such a word as that?
With eager, searching steps I ran ;
The rain poured on my hat.
Back to the tall cliff's beetling height
I sprinted on with all my might.
I caught her on the dizzy verge,
My name upon her mouth.
Beneath us far the roaring surge
Blew slantwise from the south.
“0 Rosamond.” I cried, “my dear,
Your own lost William John is here!”
She turned with an ecstatic cry
And fell upon my breast.
The rain was wet, the wind was high,
One slip achieved the rest;
For though I held her fast and tight,
The cliff went soaring out of sight.
We struck the water with a splash
That seemed to split the night.
The roaring waves were heard to crash
Some distance to the right;
But we went down and down and down.
We almost felt that we must drown.
But we came up and up and up
Until we reached the air.
No bitterness was in my cup
Of salt and dark despair.
For that bright girl whose fingers slim
Were mine for keeps I found could swim.
I know not what great ship was wreckt
Some distance from the shore
But four large planks—to be exact,
It might have been a door—
Game sliding down a mountain sea
Just half a yard from her and me.
We climbed upon that sportive raft
That rode the raging deep.
It was the wildest kind of craft;
We felt it roll and leap.
But though our hopes were really gone,
We held each other and held on.
“Sweet heart,” I said. “Dear love,” she sighed
All through that fearful night.
“My darling and my longed-for bride!”
She murmured “Hold me tight!”
And through the spindrift blind and raw
I felt her hair against my jaw.
Black as a bottom layer of tar
Was all the sky and sea.
With slither, roll and sudden jar
Our raft was floating free,
Till in the middle of the night
We felt the waves about us white.
Bump, bump, bump, bump and bump again
In smothers of white foam!
We read the warning wet and plain
That we were going home
To some bright Heaven : but on the face
Of things, it seemed an awkward place.
Bump; and the biggest lift of all,
The biggest rush and drop.
There on some cliff’s tremendous wall
Our ocean cruise must stop.
“Good-bye, dear love,” I heard her say;
My farewell shout was blown away.
But nothing happened. We were high
And dry above the sea.
I said, “Fair sweetheart, do not die,
But come along with me.
We’re somewhere. Hold my fingers tight;
I'm almost sure I saw a light.”
Our feet were on the yielding sand;
We saw the crescent foam
Of surf upon some unknown land
Where fate had tossed us home.
Then Rosamond said with regret
“O William John, we’re very wet.”
“Look, love,” I said, “the gleaming light!
And there serene it glowed.
That beacon of our soul’s delight
Shone over beach and road
And over pine-trees in a row.
She said “O William John, I know.”
Yes, it was Manly—Manly wet
As any place could be.
The rain came down like streaks of jet
And dripped from roof and tree ;
The wind along the Corso cold
Had caught more drops than it could hold.
But we were glad ; for nothing now
Could mar our perfect bliss.
A thousand times we made a vow
And sealed it with a kiss
That nevermore, whate’er might hap,
We’d jump together from the Gap.
N.S.W.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONCE, many years ago, the big rambling
house at Rose Bay had been green-
walled by the hills; to-day it was
shut in by towering piles of brick and stone.
Formerly a gravel path led for more than
a furlong beneath the trees to the main
gate; now the ’buses and trams clattered
past on the asphalt road barely a hundred
feet away. Changes notwithstanding, the
old home was not without a certain magni-
ficence in decay. The faded pillars of its
lofty portico still inspired passers-by with
a sense of the dignity attendant upon old
age. It was still known as Cartwright Manor.
More than a century had passed away since
it had been built, and for two-thirds of that
time it had been maintained in perfect order.
For the last forty years, however, little had
been done to arrest the slow process of dis-
integration. But, like Madeline Cartwright,
its solitary tenant, it still presented a bold
front to age and adversity; its quivering
rafters still upbore it, just as her tottering
legs still held the old spinster erect and urn-
daunted.
There were but two people of the ancient
stock who bore the name of Cartwright. One
was Miss Madeline, the other her uncle.
There had been no communication between
them for fifty years. Hubert Cartwright,
Madeline’s father and pioneer of the family’s
colonial fortunes, had devoted his means and
all the later years of his life to the task. of
rescuing the Cartwright honor from the mire
into which Jonathan, his younger brother,
had dragged it in those bygone days. He had
denied himself and his only child everything
but the bare necessaries of life; and he had
cut Jonathan Cartwright entirely out of his
affections —out of his very acquaintanceship.
Miss Madeline had inherited her father’s
implacable resentment against her uncle, not
so much on account of the property lost as
on account of the stain on the family name,
of which nobody knew, after her father's
death, except herself and the despoiler. A
proud woman and a hard one, the last of the
Cartwrights was as stern, as indomitable, as
had been those stubborn soldiers who had
founded her line. While her father lived
they had barely managed to pay the interest
on the mortgages. After his death she found
her resources insufficient for the task. Eittle
by little she was forced to part with the pro-
perty. The swirling tides of progress swept
away parcel after parcel of the estate, until
now little was left except the house and the
ground it stood on. Furtively, letting not
her right hand know what the left hand was
.‘hung, she had parted with almost everything
, value within the four walls. She made
lesperate endeavor to retain at least the old
home, the last stronghold of the Cartwrights,
the last material testimony to their* one-time
importance and power.
“Ret me die in the house of my fathers!”
had been her oft-repeated prayer; and to
that end she struggled as only a woman can.
How slender were her resources, how tragic
her struggle, but three people even suspected.
One was her uncle Jonathan, who would
have given a great deal in his old age for
recognition by his niece. He would have
made generous provision for her had she
allowed it. A short time before he had
broken the silence of fifty years, and had
written urging friendship, offering assistance,
but with no word of repentance or sorrow.
His letter had been returned—unopened.
Another who suspected something of the
truth was Malcolm Appleton, the lawyer.
His father and grandfather had been attor-
neys for the Cartwrights. He himself had
attended to much of Hubert Cartwright’s
legal business, which was considerable. Also,
from time to time, he looked after Miss
Madeline’s interests, which were insignifi-
cant. Lastly, there was old Israel Harris
who held the mortgage on the last bit of
the property, which was worth, as a business
site, vastly more than the amount of the en-
cumbrance. Of the three men, perhaps he
enjoyed the clearest view of the situation.
Covetousness sometimes probes deeper than
either anger or affection. So he waited,
hawklike, for the hour when Miss Madeline
would default in her payments, and he might
foreclose and tear down the crumbling ruin
which, to his material eye, disgraced the high-
way. But she did not default. Invariably,

on the appointed day, the interest was paid.
And so it went.
Miss Madeline lived alone. She went no-
where ; she received no one. On her rare
excursions into the streets her dress indi-
cated comfort, even richness, although it was
hopelessly old-fashioned. .On Sundays she
sat alone in the square old Cartwright pew,
unchanged out of respect for her, and to be
maintained intact till she died. Her pur-
chases were few and small. She lived—that
was all; no one knew exactly how; no one
greatly cared. All her friends had died or
moved away. Her former acquaintances
apparently had forgotten her. She was an
anachronism, a remnant of the past, a
withered leaf almost torn from life’s tree by
the winds of adversity; yet there was not
a prouder-looking woman in the country.
In the course of time Jonathan Cartwright,
full of years and riches, if not of honor, died.
The day after his burial, Malcolm Appleton
sent a message by his clerk to Miss Made-
line saying that her uncle’s will had been
opened and read, and that he wished to put
her in possession of its contents. If it were
agreeable he proposed to call that afternoon
to discuss the matter with her. Whatever
her feelings towards her late relative, she
could see no reason for refusing to receive
Appleton in the circumstances. She noti-
fied him through his messenger that she
awaited his pleasure.
There was but one room in the house that
remained habitable —the great library, which
ran from the front to the back along the
northern hallway. The walls were lined
with bookcases rising halfway to the ceiling.
The green silk behind the glass doors had
once concealed a multitude of rare volumes;
but now the shelves were as empty as the
house itself, as empty as Miss Madeline’s
heart—but no one knew of this emptiness
unless the doors were opened. Above the
bookcases on the walls vrere the family por-
traits of the Cartwrights—a stern, unbend-
ing line that had left many a footprint in
historic sands. Alike in the dignity of their
bearing, they were also alike in the fact that
each wore on the right hand the family ring
with its massive balas-ruby, a gift to the
original Sir Alfred Cartwright from his
gracious and melancholy Majesty Charles I.
Miss Madeline now wore that ring upon her
withered finger.
The old lady slept on an ilf-clad bed in
one corner of that room. She proceeded to
drag it into the denuded drawing-room be-
fore the arrival of her solicitor. With the
last of the firewood she kindled a fire in the
grate in the library. She had had nothing
to eat for longer than she cared to remem-
ber. The semi-annual interest on the mort-
gage had been due two days before, and the
money had gone to Harris as usual. It re-
presented everything of value in the house
with the exception of the clothes she wore,
the ring upon her wasted hand, and the
family portraits upon the wall. She had
had no fire until that afternoon. Although
the first bitterness of hunger had passed, she
shuddered in her soul vdien she found her-
self staring like a famished wolf at the
modicum of wune and handful of crackers—
meagre contents of a larder that had once
been plenteous. With a terrible effort she
controlled herself. No one must ever know.
Besides, the claims of hospitality were
sacred. Resolutely she set the wine and
the crackers on the table, walked unsteadily
to the window and waited.
It w 7 as late in the winter. A bitter wind
sang across the sandhills; the air was filled
with the presage of storm. Presently Mal-
colm Appleton came up the walk, ascended
to the high porch, and tapped at the door.
She admitted him herself.
“The servants” —she trembled pitiably in
spite of her heroic efforts at composure—
“have —in short, I am alone, and”
“Quite so,” said the solicitor. “I am
honored at being so admitted.”
“Kindly step into the library. I have a
fire, and it is warmer there. As a great
lienor —you are so old a retainer of the
family—l shall permit you to sit in my
father’s favorite chair.”
Miss Madeline never forgot, nor did she
permit an Appleton to forget, the difference
between her rank and his own. Although
lie was a man of considerable standing in
legal circles, to her lie was only a sort of
servitor. Appleton understood her feelings,
but the understanding brought only pity to
his heart and made his task even harder
than he had imagined. He glanced up at the
aged figure dressed in black satin that might
have cost pounds a yard fifty years ago, and
which w r as still stiff enough to stand alone.
His glance took in the fichu of lace crossed
over her withered bosom, and the tiny square
of the same material resting upon and blend-
ing with her crowm of snow-white hair. For
the rest, her garments covered an undaunted
heart, but little else, save what decency re-
quired.
“Pray be seated, Mr. Appleton,” she said.
“Aud let me offer you a glass of my father’s
old Madeira and a biscuit.”
The attorney watched her busying herself
at the table.
“Miss Cartwright,” he began at length, “no
doubt you have surmised the purpose of my
visit here to-day. Your uncle Jonathan died
five days ago. I have his will here in my
satchel. While fully appreciating the diffi-
culties of the situation, I feel that it is my
duty—in short, I must communicate to you
the tenor of that will.”
Miss Cartwright waved a trembling hand
and sat more erect, if possible, than before.
“Of course, Mr. Appleton, you are aware
that for 50 years neither my father nor I
have had the slightest interest in Jonathan
Cartwright. To-day is the first time I
can remember to have mentioned his name
since I \yas a girl. However, since you
have your duty to perform. I have decided
to hear you. No Cartwright ever prevented
a man from doing his duty, sir.”
“These are the terms of his will, Madam.”
The solicitor hastily unfastened his satchel
and produced the document. “I did one of
my name a grievous w r rong in early youth,”
he read. “Strangely enough, that wrong was
the foundation of my fortune. Having no
child of my own, I wish to atone, as far as
is possible, in my death, and I bequeath my
entire fortune without reservation to the
poorest relative I am possessed of, according
to the determination of the courts, in the
hope that the restitution may be enjoyed.”
Applqton read rapidly; in fact he dared
not stop, for he was burning with indignation
at the malignity with which Jonathan Cart-
wright had coupled insult with bequest.
“Is that all, sir?” inquired the old lady
calmly as he paused.
“Practically all —’the essential portion, at
any rate. There are a few minor details,
an inventory, and so forth. The value of
the estate, I may say, will be in the vicinity
of thirty thousand pounds. I congratu-
late”—
“Mr. Appleton,” interrupted Miss Made-
line, rising and standing erect, sustained by
that undaunted pride of hers. “Is it your
wish to insult me?”
“God bless you, Miss Cartwright, certainly
not!”
“Am I an object of charity, a mendicant,
that must go to court and publicly parade
poverty in order to justify my claim to this
belated and offensive attempt to repair a
wrong and injustice? Please understand, sir,
that I can make absolutely no claim upon
the estate of Jonathan Cartwright when
coupled with such a stipulation. Under
such conditions I could not touch a penny
of it, and, even if I could, I would not!”
“With deep respect, Miss Madeline, I pray
that you will make no hasty decision. Your
needs”
“Sir! I need nothing!” flamed the old
woman sternly.
“Forgive me,” pleaded the lawyer des-
perately. “I airi speaking as your father’s
friend and as your friend as well. This
money is yours by every right. If you don’t
feel inclined to accept all of it, may I sug-
gest a compromise? It means affluence,
comfort, ease everything. The clause to
which you rightfully take exception is, I
admit, a harsh and brutal one; but I know
that your uncle intended his estate to go to
you. There is other evidence.”
“His intentions are nothing to me,” she
broke in again. “If I had not a garment
wherewith to clothe myself; if I had nothing
to eat, I would never demean myself by
claiming his money with that confession.
We Cartvmghts—you, being a lawyer and a
man of business instincts, perhaps will not
understand —'hold our heads high. Now that
Jonathan Cartwright is dead, I am the last
of my line. Nothing on earth can make me
claim this bequest, sir. It would bring dis-
grace, dishonor upon my family’s name.
These little things mean nothing to you of
to-day, perhaps, but they are life itself to
me—the heritage of my fathers. Not for
twenty times that amount of money would I
sacrifice my self-respect, my pride, my honor.
No more, sir, I beg of you! My decision is
final—irrevocable!”
The excitement brought a touch of color
to the ghastly hollow of the old lady’s cheek.
Standing there in the fading light of the late
afternoon, Malcolm Appleton noted this.
“Miss Madeline,” he said at length, recog-
nising a determination against which it was
useless to struggle, “you will allow me the
privilege of old friendship to say that my
mind, my reason and my commonsense
utterly condemn what you have just said.
As a lawyer, I can but deprecate your de-
cision ; but as a man—my heart, Madam!”
He bent low, hard-headed business-man
though he was, and raised her hand to his
lips; and with the manner of a mediaeval
queen, she suffered him.
“You honor me, Mr. Appleton,” she said,
strongly moved. “I wish you to finish the
Madeira. There is another glassful and a
few more biscuits. They will strengthen
you for your cheerless homeward journey.
The weather is inclement.”
“With your permission, Madam, I will
drink to the honor of the Cartwrights. Never
was it in safer hands.”
“Thank you, sir. Good-bye.”
With old-time courtesy Appleton bowed
low and went out.
Miss Madeline remained standing, her
hands clenched, until she heard the outer
door close. For a few moments she stared
around the bare walls, her gaze resting in
turn on the portraits of her forebears, from
the cavalier of King Charles to the Cart-
wrights who had played such a big part in
the early affairs of her adopted homeland
under the Southern Cross.
“I have kept the faith,” she whispered.
“I have fought a good fight!”
Something gave way. As she sank into the
chair at the head of the table her eyes fell
upon the biscuit-crumbs and the few drops
of wine at the bottom of the glass. Her hand
went out to them, then stopped. In spite
of the deadly faintness that passed over
her she remembered that she was a Cart-
wright and drew back her arm. Then with
face buried in both withered hands she fell
forward against the table and lay still.
It was not until the second day after
Malcolm Appleton had visited her that he
came back again, intent upon making a fur-
ther effort to break down that stubborn
pride. He tapped on the door, and waited.
Take the last throb of life out of an
ancient dwelling and the hollow sound of
knocking tells a story of loneliness to be
heard nowhere else. With growing appre-
hension Appleton knocked again and then
tried the knob. The door was unfastened.
Before entering he looked back toward the
street in the hope of assistance should that
be necessary. A doctor whom he knew was
passing in his car. Impelled by what heart-
sinking premonition he could not tell, Apple-
ton called him, and the two men entei'ed the
house together.
In the library, just where he had left her,
they found Miss Madeline still and quiet,
her white head upon her arms, the ruby
upon her finger alone instinct with life. The
last of the Cartwrights had gone to join
her ancestors.
“She’s been dead for some hours,” said the
physician after a hurried examination.
“What was it, do you think? Her heart?"
“Starvation, I should say. See” —he
pointed to the table —-“the remains of her
last meal!”
Appleton gave a cry, then dropped into a
chair, staring up at the doctor, his face
as white as the cold cheek across the table.
“Her last meal!” he repeated in a dazed
way. “My God ! And she made me eat it!”

THE
“ ATCO ”
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2f-li.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient powey
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of * its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square ydrds of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l;' 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN
THE MAN WHO ASSISTED TO BUILD UP THE AMERICAN IRON AND STEEL
INDUSTRY.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN’S VIEWS were stated in this way:
When an American pays dollars tor steel to a foreign manufacturer
America has the steel and the foreigner has the dollars.
But when he pays dollars for steel to an American manufacturer,
America has both the steel and the dollars.
Lincoln’s words are true to-day. When Australia sends outside the Commonwealth for Iron
and Steel, she does an injustice to Australians by depriving them of work, and also places
the Commonwealth at the mercy of an enemy in the time of danger.

Nothing else should he used in Australian Workshops—Why Favor the Foreigner ?
