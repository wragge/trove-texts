THE STUARTS
Hesketh Pearson could hardly fail
to make a good job of his Charles II
(Heinemann). Charles lived in the
open, exposed to inspection from all
angles, and his biographer had so
much rich material that he had to dis-
card a great deal of it.
It was the era which initiated the
practice of garnering personalia about
all notable identities. In the guise of
the news-sheet and the pamphlet, the
professional journalist arrived. And
Charles himself was completely indiffer-
ent to opinion on either his public or
his private life.
Intellectually he was so superior to
his contemporaries that he had a con-
tempt for their fanatical codes of
conduct and morals which he masked
by an air of tolerance and humor.
From early youth he had been thrown
into contact with all classes of men. He
had been through the Civil War and had
become a hunted fugitive. He had
endured years of penury under frequent
threat of assassination by Cromwell’s
thugs. He was thirty when he came to
the throne, and had achieved that wis-
dom which is only given to the elect
who have had much to do with
humanity in the mass, which is that
nothing can be done to eradicate its
insensate hatreds in all polemical
conflict.
At best, an unstable balance may be
maintained to keep the various factions,
religious and political, from going to
extremes in violence. How well Charles
succeeded in maintaining that balance
is evidenced by the way that futile ass,
his brother James, upset it the moment
he came to the throne. In short, any
study of Charles and his time carries
the conviction that he was one of the
few truly sane men of his generation.
Pc arson’s presentation of Charles
himself, and the prominent notabilities
about him. is extremely well done. It
is deplorable, then, that he should haw
allowed that “vile Whig” Macaulay to
so prejudice him in his estimate of
Charles I. No man has been so damn-
ably misjudged by historians and
sociologists as Charles I.
They have dealt only with his short-
comings as a politician and have
ignored his strenuous efforts to maintain
a high standard of culture in the intel-
lectual movements of his time.
It was not due to religious intolerance
that he came into conflict with the
people. That conflict was engineered
by the middle-class financiers, the mer-
chants, tradesmen, shipping-magnates,
who saw their interests menaced by
Charles’s taxation. But by calling in
the mob to attack the monarchy, they
made the mistake which the Italian
and German financiers did when they
called on Mussolini’s and Hitler’s
gangs to defend them against the threat
of Communism; the gang-leaders took
over.
And Cromwell, as a gang-leader, was
infinitely more evil than even a Hitler,
for his Puritan fanatics have infected
the English-speaking people to this day
with their efforts to stamp out all free
expression in thought and art. Here is
a brief picture of the England of
Charles I before Cromwell’s obscene
underworld mob stamped out all
gracious living in it. It is to Rubens
that we owe this pre-Cromwellian
presentation of England:—•
This island seems to me to be a
spectacle worthy of the interest of
every gentleman, not only for the
beauty of its countryside and the
charm of the nation ; not only for
the splendor of its outward culture,
which seems to be extreme, as of
a people rich and happy in the lap
of peace, but for the incredible
quantity of excellent pictures,
statues, and ancient inscriptions
which are to be found in this court.
I need not mention the Arundel
marbles. I confess I have never seen
anything in the world so rare.
Rubens had travelled in all Euro-
pean countries, and knew their peoples,
cultures and living conditions, so his
estimate here of the English people is
authoritative. Charles bought his own
collection of pictures; probably the
finest in Europe. A few of them
survive in the National Gallery; the
rest were destroyed by Cromwell’s
rabble, as they destroyed many other
priceless works.
It was on Rubens’s advice that
Charles made Van Dyck his Court
Painter and thereby gave the first
impetus to England’s great school of
portrait-painters. There is no more
depressing spectacle to contemplate in
the whole range of English history than
this debacle of a great episode of
civilisation, begun by the splendor of
Elizabethan poetry, which carried on
into the reign of James I, who added to
it the stimulus of the finest transla-
tions of the classics that have yet been
done. We owe to James the English
versions of three of the greatest civilis-
ing forces, Chapman’s Homer, Mon-
taigne’s Essays and Urquhart’s
Rabelais.
James carried on the tradition of
Elizabethan poetiy by giving English
literature an equally high standard in
prose. His son Charles carried that
impetus on to plastic art, and the Eng-
lish schools of painting had their«
being in the examples he, and?
enlightened members of his co
collected in their tours
Europe. And at a stroke CroiJ
and his underworld rabble smashed th
upward surge of a high standard?
civilised culture.
It is astonishing that Charles ||
managed to restore some sort of ord*
in the country, and only a man withl,k
superb tolerance in the face of hong
imbecility could have done it. He hadi'
pick up as best he could the disrupted
strands of culture left over from his
father’s reign and set them in actios
again. And very well he did it,
Aubrey noted, he had a fine taste 4
painting and he established Lely a<-'
Court Painter, and he patronised 4
works of other painters.
He had an equally good taste
music and established his own Com
orchestra. He restored the stage, ai
the drama came back to enlighten and
enliven the black gloom of puritanisi
He was Wren’s patron in the rebuild®
of St. Paul’s Cathedral. He inaugir
ated the Royal Society, and so beg:*
the study of all natural phenomea
which fascinated him. He was akw
student of ship-construction, and tit
Navy of his day made a vast advance
in both sailing qualities and fire-pow
which was to give England the master;
of the seas. ,
Any man of distinguished intelligence
was welcomed to his court, and he toot
an equal pleasure in the wit c
Rochester and Suckling as in the dis
course of Hobbes, of whom Auk
says that “he gave orders that Hobbs
should have free access to his Majesti
who always much delighted in his i
and repartee.”
In short, the three Stuart kings are
phenomenon hard to account for, Tk
are the only monarchs who sat on tt

NEW GUINEA'S FUTURE
YVN reports so far ta hand, A. A.
Calwell, leader of the Federal
Opposition, has found little to com-
plain about in the way that Australia
is managing its own and Trust affairs
in New Guinea.
He has welcomed the Prime Minis-
ter’s suggestion that they should both
meet to discuss Mr. Calwell’s earlier
suggestion that a Joint Parliamentary
Committee should investigate New
Guinea problems.
On his own statements in Port
Moresby, Calwell has found the natives
in favor of continuing relations with
Australia much-the same as now. He
has been quoted as saying that “I am
sure that if the natives were pressed on
this point by the U.N. Trusteeship
Council or any other authority they
would vote overwhelmingly for the
close association with Australia which
exists at present.” He added that Aus-
tralia had every reason to be proud
of what it had done for New Guinea
education.
All in all, the reported comments of
Mr. Calwell seemed sincere, and, in a
party-political sense, handsome.
It is to be hoped that any investiga-
tion or report by a Joint Parliamentary
Committee will be equally sincere.
Too often Opposition members of
committees don’t go looking for
knowledge; only for arguments with
which to hit the Government. And if
they don’t find them they invent some,
which will be repeated as gospel by the
members of the Trusteeship Council
inimical to the West and bent on
breaking-up its influence.
To the Communist agitator, the
promoter of the “cargo cult” and the
Indonesian spreader of discontent, such
visits would certainly be considered
godsent, and there will follow a great
licking of lips over the speeches which
the travellers presently make in Parlia-
ment and a rush to translate the more
useful parts of them into pidgin,
especially the parts that criticise the
administration and the Government in
Canberra and are most likely to cause
insubordination and discontent.
The trouble about Papua and
New Guinea is that nearly everybody
who writes about them and their
future has little conception of how they
are made up and how unlikely it is
that within foreseeable time they can
be welded together into a “nation,”
and, if they were, that they would have
the slightest chance of standing on
their own feet.
r pO begin with, New Guinea does not
contain one people, but dozens of
different kinds of people brown,
black, yellow-ochre and what-not,
ranging from big, ebony-colored Bukas
to little, naked Kukukukus.
The Territory is not one solid land-
mass but includes hundreds of islands
scattered off the coast of a large, wild
island. And, like Gaul, it is divided
into two parts for purposes of govern-
ment.
One part, Papua, is indubitably an
Australian possession; the other part,
governed as an appendage by a most
impolitic arrangement, is a Trust
Territory.
The two areas have only one thing
in common: they owe everything they
have in way of law and order, progress,
commerce, industry and transport (sea,
land and air), to European initiative,
organisation and finance.
Papua is wholly within the tropics
—between five degrees and 12 degrees
south. It has about the same area as
Victoria, but is 900 miles long, and
nearly 3000 square miles of it are
made-up of islands, the denizens of
some of which scarcely are aware that
there is a mainland and don’t want to
know, anyway.
The European population probably
runs to nearly 10,000; but nobody is
quite sure even in this long-settled bit
of country how many natives there are
because nobody has ever been able to
catch them all to count them —quite a
piece of the interior territory is still
not under control.
However, over 300,000 have been
accounted for, showing a remarkable
dearth of females, and it is “estimated”
that there may be another 150,000.
Most of them are within reach of the
coast. The interior is lightly populated
—in some places there are more moun-
tains than people.
Of the estimated 58,000,000 acres
of land, only 25,000 have been
alienated as freehold and 300,000 as
leaseholds. The Government holds 11-
million acres. It is not possible for
any more freehold to be acquired.
Papua’s economic condition is shown
by the fact that its imports are near
£lO million and its exports near £4
million; that natives pay no taxes.
The adjacent New Guinea Trust
Territory has a land-area slightly more
than that of New Guinea, of
70,000 square-miles is on the north-
eastern mainland and the rest in the
Bismarck Archipelago (largest island
New Britain, 14,100 square-miles) and
the Solomon Islands, 4100 square-
miles (largest island Bougainville, 3®
square-miles).
However, the coastlines of dozens of
little islands have not been surveyed,
so that the areas in some cases are
merely guessed at.
The population has been enumerated
to a total of about 1,200,000, but there
are still a lot of naked uncatchables.
Apart from natives, the non-Europeans
total about -11,000, including 2000 well-
established Chinese who have families
native in the third, .and even fourth
generations.
The population is more polyglot fa'
that of Papua—Melanesian, Papuan,
Polynesian, with a few Negritos. These
peoples are isolated from each other in
jumbled job-lots and speak enough
languages to stock the Tower of Babel
Only two per cent, of the land is'
alienated —about 1.2 million acres out
of a total of 59 million. However, Ness
Guinea’s exports and imports bake
better than those of Papua, each being
in the region of £lO million.
T>OTH Papua and New Guinea art >

revenue consists about five parts ef
Commonwealth Government grant aii
one part Customs-duties, plus a millior
or so earned from gold and _ timber
royalties, stamp-duties and licences

All this vast, dispersed agglomerate|

parts sea and two-parts land is as la?
as the three eastern States of Australia j
It is inhabited by backward peop'i

They are now solemnly put iofl®
as being ready for self-govern®

They can never become a whole #

"TELL ME. HAROLD, JUST WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Back to Savagery
“Trouble-spot” is scarcely the term to
describe the west of Africa, which has
been flung, half-baked, into “self-
government.”
The example of Ghana should have
been enough, even though it at least has
an assortment of professional men, with
British tutelage, and a British hand under
its elbow till it learns to walk.
But a dozen partly savage States having
secured freedom, the Belgian Govern-
ment was weak enough to allow its
Socialists to hand the Congo over to
people like Lumumba —a million square-
miies, with rich minerals round its edges
and an Edgar Wallace Sanders of the
River atmosphere about the rest. Not to
mention Mr. Hammarskjold and Dr.
Bunche flapping their hands in the back-
ground, and a lot of their “forces,”
accustomed to regard foreign service as
swimming and cooking competitions,
infiltrated with Ghanaian, Tunisians,
Moroccans and Irish served up for
dessert and looking surprised that they
might encounter violence.
It is strange that the most civilised
part of Congo is Katanga, capital
Elizabethville. That is the part farthest
from the sea, and abutting Rhodesia,
into which its tribes spill over.
There the great Belgian and other
mining-companies have a record of good
housing, good food, good wages and
technical training for the African. And
the Africans, led by their provincial
Premier, Tshombe, doesn’t want them to
leave and will have none of Lumumba
and his quarrelling tribes and murdering
and raping levies.
With the disruption of business due
to the flight or murder of the Belgians,
Leopoldville, the capital, has become a
wilderness in which work has largely
ceased to exist as a paid operation;
slaughter is prevented by a variety of
troops; and the Economic Minister
(while Mr. Lumumba was fulminating in
New York and elsewhere and a
Ghanaian delegation was trying to find
him in London) had to be rescued from
an angry crowd of Congolese “toilers”
who were eager to tear him to bits be-
cause they weren’t able to get the large
rise in wages that had been promised
all round when the Belgians were thrown
out.
Further inland, the disunity of Congo
as a nation was demonstrated during the
week in the Kasai Province by an out-
break of tribal fighting—it goes on all
the time in cosmopolitan Leopoldville—
between the Balubas and the Lalua who,
with deaths up to about 100 on August 2,
looked like driving their adversaries into
Katanga Province.
Few of the Baluba were likely to get
there, since they had to pass through the
Tshokwe country, where it was odds to
nothing that they would be eaten alive.
There are U.N. troops in the Lalua
capital, but they *&re unlikely to inter-
vene because Mr. Lumumba mightn’t
like it and tribal fights are a “domestic
matter.”
The Belgians have 8500 troops in the
Congo, and 5500 are unlikely to leave
because they are in Katanga, into which
Mr. Lumumba proposed on August 1
in peremptory fashion that the* U.N.
should send its troops at once. All the
troops that got in consisted of Uncle
Sam’s wandering U.N. boy. Dr. Bunche,
and he had some difficulty in getting out
because the Katangans, having refused
to have anything to do with the murder-
ing tribes and the hysterical Lumumba,
apple-pied the aerodromes against any
intrusion by Mr. Hammarskjold’s 11,000
mixed forces.
The U.N. is powerless on its own
rulings to do anything, since obviously
the Katanga affair is a “domestic matter”
in which its charter forbids it to inter-
fere. Russia has been rumbling threats
of world war in the background.
Lumumba is in a hopeless position if
Katanga goes, because it is the bread
and butter of the rest of the Congo,
which otherwise is in commercial chaos
and hasn’t the resources to live at
Western standards.
The mischievous Nkrumah, yearning
for an African empire, has declared him-
self ready to back savagery if the U.N.
won’t act in Katanga.
With the Security Council holding
emergency meetings and half Africa in
a state of corroboree, the position is not
bright for the U.N., which has come up
against an insoluble problem which
refuses to conform in any facet to its
theories.
The only solution is to leave Mr.
Lumumba to his domestic affairs. His
people would probably be happier with
their tribal wars and leopard-men than
they are trying to ape Western civilisa-
tion. And Mr. Tshombe can probably
look after himself, or arrange for some-
body to look after his rich province.
It is part of the U.N. system that
every little backward State, best for-
gotten, cannot get along except by being
wet-nursed by the whole of the West.
This is a nice expedient round which to
build a world-quarrel between the two
great systems of democracy and Com-
munism.
The Congo’s problem is something
neither the U.N. nor the Russians can
hope to solve short of the risk of world
war. The sane thing is for everybody
to get out of Congo and let it settle its
own hash.
Noughts-and-Crosses
[From “Collins-street”]
It is gravely announced in Canberra
that after considerable study of the
Act now covering TV and broadcasting
by both the Postmaster-General and the
Attorney-General the learned opinion has
been reached that Independent Television
Corporation, Ltd., may buy Electronic
Industries’ controlling-interest in GTV9,
Melbourne ; so Sir Frank Packer now
owns TV-stations in both Melbourne and
Sydney. m
Nobody in Melbourne who knew nf
the manoeuvring before Sir Arth
Warner sold out to Packer was surprised
by this Canberra statement but rather b
the fact that it took so long.
In happy anticipation of Sir Garfield’s
approval, Independent Television Cor
poration was registered in Melbourne
last week with Sir Frank Packer, Sir
Arthur Warner, G. A. and P. R. Warner
and G. S. Reichenbach as directors.
Nominal capital is £4 million in
shares, presumably to help pay the £375
million for the 62i per cent, interest
bought by Sir Frank Packer fr ODI
Warner’s Electronic Industries. Ind e .
pendent Television will become a wholly,
owned subsidiary of T. V. Corp., Ltd
which controls Packer’s station TCN9
Sydney.
The announcement that Canberra had •
approved the sale of GTV9 to Packer
appeared in Melbourne “Sun,” part of
the proprietary which also owns the rival
commercial station in Victoria, HSV7,
under the headline, “Sydney Gets GTV
Control.” Clearly, in the eyes of Mel
bourne “Sun,” the fate only of the
irrevocably damned.
Where Are the Police?
Victoria’s police accident-appreciation
squad has produced this year its most
arresting report on the incidence of)
alcohol on the accident-rate.
The squad is highly intelligent, ex-
perienced, and mobile, and has shown
in previous years no wowser prejudice,
so that the figures must be accepted as
those of unbiased men with special skills
in determining the causes of accidents,
Only serious accidents are dealt with
in their report. They found that alcohol >
was a factor in 101 out of 206 road-
accidents and the main factor in 83 of
the 101 ; they had some doubt about 18,
The “top” in the analysis went to 1
alcohol and speed (37 cases), and alcohol
and faulty road-position (chiefly driving
on the wrong side), 29 cases. There were
many other cases of faulty driving allied '
with alcohol, and speed laced with other
faults accounted for 36 cases. Inatten-
tion (19) was the third-highest cause.
In four of the cases the accidents were
due to alcohol-affected pedestrians, and
pedestrians were at fault in 15 other cases
as well. , '
The preoccupation of various Vie
torian authorities with drunken driving
can be understood when they are con
fronted with such official figures;
it is possible that some element of bia
is attachable to Government departs 11
themselves.
Victoria’s roads are unpoliced for
hours of the day and night, and P°
officials claim they cannot provide tra
policemen when they are not avails
draw upon. This is true only in P a
There is continual empire-buildm?
the police force in the
“squads” on “special duties,” w


to consist of young policemen
Bering around Melbourne in couples
inclothes on no special duty at all;
* Ceding what only officials call
f. on harassing hotelkeepers about
"Cr regulations, and on catching the
few remaining s.-p. merchants, whose
days are numbered anyway.
These seem trivial duties on which to
nr UDV young policemen in the light of
JJe latest accident-figures.
The Playford Way
The methods of South Australia’s Tom
playford have been illustrated for years
j n the manner in which he has gone
ahea d of other States in providing
housing.
The reason for his success is that
basically he and his Housing Trust do
the planning and often the financing,
and private enterprise, sure of continuing
work for itself and its men, is encouraged
to assemble large permanent set-ups
which enable it to build cheaply, quickly
and solidly.
With the Elizabeth project behind
him—it brought a new large town into
existence, to house factory-workers—he
and the firm of Reid Murray Develop-
ment the other day launched a plan for
another town, nine miles north of
Adelaide, to provide 1250 “good-
quality, economically-priced houses” in
a well-planned neighborhood” at an out-
lay of about £6 million. These will house
about 5000 people.
At the official opening of the scheme
Playford told 1000 guests that it takes
“a good deal of pluck and enterprise
to handle successfully an investment of
that iort.” But it takes less in S.A. than
it would in the shabby atmosphere of
land-handling by the Government and
council bodies round Sydney.
An architect on the committee of the
Adelaide Town Planning Committee said
that he could hardly believe a develop-
ment project like Para Hills could hap-
pen unless carried out by the Housing
Trust, which has a very high reputation
* n S.A. The architect added that the
Projects planned were “comparable with
the S.A. Housing Trust developments,”
which were “the envy of other housing
authorities because they were the best in
Australia.”
When the proposal came before the
town Planning Committee it had been
astonished at the fact that whereas sub-
orders were normally required to set
I*. e 5 per cent, of the land for recrea-
'on, at Para Hills 15 per cent, had been
o lotted, and arrangements made to plant
alleys and other parts not suitable for
ousin B as native flora reserves. On
dC h s ide of the houses long fingers of
Pen space planted with trees and shrubs
Jj. §i ye a natural setting, and the
co Cl! ? g °T the houses had been carefully
ch ,:r<l with shopping - centres and
rc hes away from heavy traffic routes,
ustomers for houses will be able to
the P r °*°types and plans at once, with
S ch P ., n ? w^Be that if everything goes to
u e they will be able to get into
homes af reasonable prices (much more
than reasonable by Sydney standards)
within three years, with all facilities in-
stalled roads, sewerage and water
laid on.
It appears to be a fine example of
Government-private-enterprise co-opera-
tion.
The U.N. and Lawlessness
Events in Cuba illustrate the present
moral state of the world and make it
no wonder that de Gaulle of France and
Adenauer of West Germany have gone
back to secret diplomacy to get out of
the hurly-burly.
Castro took-over Cuba by force, killed-
off his enemies without anything that
bore the slightest likeness to a fair trial
—the issue was not whether those he shot
were guilty of something, but whether
they had a chance to defend themselves
against the charges for which they were
incontinently executed.
Next, egged-on by the Communist
agents close to him, the new dictator,
who has no authority given him by vote
of the Cubans, used the resources and
facilities provided by the Americans,
British and Dutch, the customers on whose
trade and tourism Cuba survives, failed to
pay for them and then began to seize
their property willy-nilly without com-
pensation. He turned for protection to
the Communist Powers who had never
done anything for Cuba and its people,
and received arms from them.
Encouraged by their promises of abso-
lute protection if the United States should
lay a finger on them in retaliation for
their thefts, he proceeded to outrageous
slander and insult and further banditry.
He has now seized all U.S. citizens’
property in the island —except the one
thing he can’t seize, the Guantanamo
base, which the U.S. occupies under
treaty. Everything he has done is brutal,
illegal and a wanton negation of the
principles of the United Nations.
Everything that Russia and its satellites
have done in this and a thousand other
matters is equally a negation of United
Nations principles and laws. Khrush-
chev’s latest outburst in reply to Mr.
Macmillan’s courteous and moderate
Note is abusive, threatening and against
world peace.
He has made it plain that he does
not care that he has been caught-out
in illegal shooting-down of the RB-47
aircraft over international waters. His
declaration, if clear language means
anything, is to the effect that he, and
only he, will decide the status of waters
within flying-reach of Russia, and he,
and only he, will dictate what any other
Power may do within its own domain
or that covered by international law.
And woe betide whoever thwarts him.
He will not regard the dictum of the
International Court. He will veto rulings
and decisions of the Security Council,
and he will defend anybody, savage or
civilised, who attracts reprisals by mur-
derous and unprovoked attacks on whites.
And he will abuse and threaten anybody
who hinders the drift of any little
rabble colony towards becoming a
Communist satellite.
Despite this, Moscow, Cuba and
some other countries just as bad remain
members of the United Nations, even
some of the Security Council. They are
able to vote in judgment in the Assembly
on their own misdeeds. They are able
to protect themselves by the veto against
the consequences of their own actions.
The U.N. is becoming an utter farce.
Disaster-insurance
With flood conditions existing or
imminent last week at towns on
four rivers—the Murray, Murrumbidgee,
Lachlan and Macquarie—thousands of
people must have felt that there was
sound commonsense in the proposal put
forward only a week earlier by W. R.
Weiley, Country - party M.L.A. for
Clarence in the N. S. Wales Parliament.
Weiley had suggested that it was high
time the State and Federal Governments
put their heads together and evolved a
plan for providing relief for the victims
of national disasters.
By national disasters Weiley meant
floods, bushfires, destructive storms and
similar disasters which from time to time
strike some section of the country and
bring ruin to hundreds, if not thousands
of families.
At present there is no real organisation
for dealing with such disasters. Govern-
ments usually come to the aid of the
victims ; councils, churches and charit-
able organisations rally round to help.
But there is no attempt to spread the
loss from these unforeseen catastrophies
over the whole community.
Mr. Weiley’s suggestion is for a
disaster-insurance scheme, organised on
a national scale and made compulsory,
as in the case of third-party insurance
and workers’ compensation. During
World War II a national plan for in-
surance against war-damage was in force
in Australia. That, of course, was made
possible under the Federal Government’s
wartime powers. A plan for disaster-
insurance would need the consent and
co-operation of the six States, but it
should not be very difficult to secure
that. Every State suffers periodical visi-
tations of flood, fire or cyclones and the
Commonwealth Government is usually
asked to dip into its coffers to contribute
to relief-funds.
When Tasmania was hit by floods a
few months ago Weiley seized the oppor-
tunity to point out to Premier Reece
how useful his plan would have been.
The Tasmanian Premier agreed to bring
the proposal up at the next Premiers’
Conference.
New Zealand has been operating a
disaster-insurance scheme for 15 years.
After meeting all claims the fund now
has an accumulated credit of £l5 million.

Tn a paragraph on this page, in The
Bulletin of July 6, some comments
on the re-enactment at Cooktown (N.Q.)
of the 190th anniversary of the arrival
of H.M.S. Endeavour in the river were
made. It was inferred that during the
evening celebrations “Captain Cook” and
others “had been pinched for being on
licensed premises after hours, to wit, the
bar of the pub at 2030 hrs.” In a letter
to The Bulletin from Cooktown one
of the participants in the re-enactment
ceremony says:
I took the part of Captain Cook and
was not in a pub or “pinched.” Further-
more I have never been “pinched” or
arrested to date.
The Bulletin acknowledges that the
paragraph it published was in error, and
offers its sincere apologies for the mis-
take. It also regrets any personal
embarrassment the paragraph may have
caused.

dark.” Looking at the sun-and-moon
tables for this year, I notice that there
was the same amount of sunlight
each of June 21, 22 and 23 ; so m
what would determine the shortest day?
At the other end of the year, when the
summer solstice comes round, I find that
December 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 each
have the same amount of sunlight; so
would my childhood conception of Ju®
21 and December 21 have been upset

A letter About...
Hamilton Hume—
and All That
By S. H. HUME
Since others have joined
issue with Frank
O'Grady, and since
sundry aunts, cousins
and similar charming fauna
have been sniping privately at
ve L n t ° n
a esed illiteracy, senility
d the merits and demerits
(mostly the latter) of O’Grady’s
novel, No Boundary Fence,
perhaps Bulletin readers will
be interested in what might
best be described as the family
viewpoint and picture of the
explorer. It is one .that any-
one wishing to paint Hamilton
from a new angle will find
difficult to by-pass.
I commend Frank O’Grady
for at least having a go, which
was my primary reason for
giving him all the assistance
I could and writing the fore-
word to his novel. '
To try to .assess Hamilton
Hume and appreciate this
family conception of him,
something must be known of
hs background, his parents
and others closely connected
™ .
first, his parents.
It is really unjust to deal
bnefiy with such a colorful
personality as Andrew Hamil-
ton Hume I, the father. He was
the eldest son of the Rev. Jas.
Hume, Presbyterian Minister,
parish of Moira, County
Down (“Northern Ireland,
please ,» say my Scottish _
minded aunts). His mother
TI f
™. Ann Hamilton sister of
Ma J or Hamilton, of Greenage
an< f Greenfield. A grand-
daughter of John Kennedy
Hume (she is now dead)
wrote: “Both parents were
Scottish.”
Now, when an anguished
aunt explodes into the tele-
phone with “My God, Stuart!
O’Grady’s made Andrew I a
bloody Irishman,” it isn’t any
use my telling her that he was
probably born at Hillsborough,
County Down, and so would
be Irish. Frank O’Grady takes
his life in his hands, for the
mother of Andrew has her
surname perpetuated to this
day, and Hamilton certainly
seems Scottish,
Both father and son did
their best to perpetuate their
Scottish ancestry by labelling
points of interest in Australia
with such names as March-
mont, Redbraes, Wedderburn,
etc.
A ndrew was a bright lad.
'C* He spent but 23 years of
his life in Ireland, and in 46
of his 84 he managed to get
himself court-martialled and
cashiered from the Irish
militia for fighting a duel
(with the wrong bloke);
interest himself in flax-grow-
ing, and earn the enmity of
Sir Francis Rawdon, Earl
Moira, who had befriended
him (he made love to Lady
Mary, the peer’s daughter);
get himself a job with Dun-
can Campbell at Woolwich as
“Superintendent of Convicts”
on the hulks; get himself
wrecked on the Guardian near
Table Bay in ' 1789 whilst
coming to Australia as an
“agric instructor” to convicts
(he lost all his hair in that
disaster, and ever after wore
a wig); arrive by the
Juliana in June, 1790; become
Deputy-Governor of Norfolk
Island and fall-out with
Governor King; become a
settler with 30 acres of hungry
land at Toongabbie in 1794 ;
get himself a job in the Com-
m i s s a r i a t at Parramatta
(Superintendent of Livestock);
get himself charged with rape
and robbing of the Govern-
ment stores ; get kicked out
by King, reinstated by John-
ston, kicked out again by
Foveaux ; marry Elizabeth
Moore Kennedy, a Church of
England clergyman’s sister, and
daughter of another; talk
Macquarie into giving him
100 acres at Appin (1811);
settling-down to rear a great
pioneering family and make
a good job of the farm,
With his wife tactfully
handling his ungovernable
temper he somehow managed
to stay out of jail. Without a
doubt his explosive nature,
fed by hatred of the system
with which he was for so
long associated and an “Irish-
man’s” antipathy to most
forms of authority, he earned
the bitter enmity of many in
power—notably King. This
did not make it easy for his
accomplished wife or any
easier for his children.
Though both Hamilton and
his father were strong charac-
ters, each with a fiery temper,
there is no evidence that the
son and the father didn’t hit
it off, which might have been
expected in view of dad’s past
performances. There is, how-

POLITICAL POINTS
over 2s. 6d.?
• ' •
The announced intention of the Prime
Minister to discuss New Guinea prob-
lems with Opposition - leader Calwell
before Parliament reopens is very wel-
come. It would be disastrous if New
Guinea were made a subject for party-
political squabbles. On their most recent
utterances there doesn’t seem to be any
great difference between the views of the
two party-leaders, and the adoption of
Calwell’s suggestion for a Joint Parlia-
mentary Committee on New Guinea
could be the best means of ensuring the
bipartisan policy which commonsense
demands.
• •
Nkrumah, of Ghana, and Toure, of
Guinea, have hastened to assure Lu-
mumba that they’ll place their armies at
his disposal if U.N. forces can’t do the
job. This would suit Nkrumah, who sees
himself as president of a United States
of Africa. But there’s one little matter
the three don’t seem to have given much
thought. The expenses of the Ghana
(and other) troops in the Congo under
the U.N. banner are borne by U.N.—
which means that most of the cost falls
on America, Britain and other major
Powers. Who finds the money if U.N.
withdraws?
• •
Five buildings of early Sydney have
been declared “places of historic
interest,” which means that the Cumber-
land County Council is empowered to
acquire them for “public use and enjoy-
ment.” The buildings are Elizabeth Farm,
Parramatta, built by John Macarthur in
1793-94 ; Elizabeth Bay House, built for
Alexander Macleay, Colonial Secretary,
1832-37 ; Roseneath Cottage, Parramatta,
built in the 1840’s for Mrs. Janet Temple-
ton (who is said to have introduced
merino sheep to Victoria); Fernhill,
Mulgoa, built for Edward Cox, son of
William Cox who built the first road
through the Blue Mountains; Kelvin
(“The Retreat”), Bringelly, built about
1820 by Thomas Laycock.
All five buildings are used as private
homes, and the Cumberland County
Council does not intend at present to exer-
cise its power of acquisition. Numerous
other buildings have been suggested by
the National Trust and other bodies as
being worthy of preservation for their
historical associations, but the Govern-
ment is apparently unable to make up its
mind even to take the token step it has at
last agreed to in the case of the five
homes now “declared.”
The week’s understatement:
“Mr. Diefenbaker told Mr. Lumumba
that he did not think it would be possible
for Canada at present to participate in
the Congo’s investment and development
programme.”
• •*
The Communist Seamen’s Union con-
tinues to immobilise shipping, while the
Waterside Workers are playing it soft and
offering to impose their own discipline
on drunks and pilferers— at whose activi-
ties They at long last profess to be deeply
shocked. The Stevedoring Authority will
be foolish if it falls for the ramp —it
would virtually place the discipline of
the industry in the hands of the Central
Committee of the Communist party.
• •
De Gaulle and Adenauer are reported
to have made important agreements
affecting the peaceful coexistence of
France and Germany without the help of
the press and a million critics round the
world. Macmillan goes to Bonn on
August 10. All the leaders of Western
Europe seem to be nervous that Khrush-
chev is aiming to make September a

An example of Seamen’s Union tactics
was to be seen in the short crews which
prevented ships sailing last week' from
leading ports. In Hobart the cargo-vessel
South Esk, loaded with perishable ap D l

was eventually allowed to get away

affected was the Princess of Tasmani
because (says a Seamen’s official) “I’

along with their holidaying families and
cars. It has a grim humor in the li»ii t

[From Canberra]
Several Government back-benchers art
criticising Treasurer Harold Holt for ft
proposed absence from Australia during the i
major part of the Budget debate. Holt il
present the Budget to Parliament next Tuesday,
but within a fortnight will be on his way to
Europe and the United States for meetings
of the World Bank, of which he is governor,
These .back-benchers realise that Holt must
attend the overseas meetings, but they fttl
he should have timed presentation of tit
Budget to allow him to be in Parliament wta
it was debated.
This will be Holt’s second Budget. It ml
also be the second occasion on which he ks
been absent during debate on it. Last year
he was also abroad during Budget discuss*
As to the Budget itself, the cloak of secrecy
has been drawn even tighter around it this
year than in the past. However, it seems,
fairly likely that the Government will reimport
the 6d.-in-the-£ company-tax which it lifted
a couple of years ago, increase excise my
whisky, liberalise the means-test and possibly
increase the age-pension by up to ss. a wed

P. D. Hills, N.S.W. Minister for Local
Government, denied last week that his
Government favored payment of aider-
men. In fact, he went further and said
they were definitely opposed to the idea.
It is nevertheless true that an influential
section of Labor wants paid aldermen,
and if this view is ever accepted by an
A.L.P. annual conference the N. S. Wales
Government will have to put it into effect

It’s not too easy to decide whether
old-time Laborites like Stoneham, the
Victorian Parliamentary Leader, and
Tripovich, the candidate for M.L.C., are
financially ignorant or just cocking a blind

platforms that Coles and ' Woolworths
have millions to splash about but there’s
no money for sewerage.
Actually only about one-eighteenth of
the nearly £lB million offered in bids
between the rival firms is in cash ; the
rest is premium on their shares. The
battle has been a healthy show of com-
petition in a free society, but the A.L.P.
winces at talk of competition.

L. W. Hamilton, Country-party M.H.R.
for Canning (W.A.), has decided to re-
tire from politics at the end of the
present Parliament, for reasons of health.
He won the Swan seat at the 1946 elec-
tion in the “little swing” against Labor
that presaged the 1949 landslide, and
switched to Canning after the 1948 re-
distribution. In his first campaign in
Canning he had to argue with a Liberal
as well as a Labor opponent. Thereafter
he had no difficulty in holding the seat
by a big majority ; in 1955 he was un-
opposed. Hamilton served in both World
Wars —A.I.F. in the first, R.A.A.F. in
the second. He never reached Cabinet
rank but at various times served as
Parliamentary Secretary for the Interior,
Works and the P.M.G. He was also a
member of the Joint Committee on Con-

TTwo sets of people have been deflating
Russian boasts this week. Sir Mac-
farlane Burnet, 0.M., distinguished
medical scientist, fresh back from
Moscow wrote: “In the fields of science
in which I am interested there have been
no really outstanding Russian achieve-
ments since 1917.” He says the Russians’
strength has lain in their application
of standard methods used all over the
world to the solution of their immediate
practical problems. The second deflater
is Kassem, of Iraq, shocked to discover
that the Russian oil-experts and other
authorities sent him are not as good as
his own, much less the British and
American. He is packing many off home.

“Ex-ACT”: During the current Budget-
predicting (Treasurer Harold Holt will
tell us all on August 16) there’s been
some inspired but dispiriting talk about
more excise on beer and cigarettes. This
may be just to cause some brief rejoicing
if there’s no increase after all, but it
doesn’t seem likely that the “temporary”
increases of 2s. Bd. a gallon on beer and
3d. on a large packet of cigarettes, put
on four years ago, are going to be
removed as yet. After all, this isn’t

James Orr, former secretary of the
Gippsland Trades and Labor Council,
which has now passed into the hands of
the dnity militants, resigned from the
Amalgamated Engineering Union. Now
the Australasian Society of Engineers
won’t admit him, the Ironworkers’ will
take him, and the chairman of the Elec-
tricity Commission wants him to work,
but Orr claims he has been sacked by
the commission’s superintendent.
He has taken-out a summons against
the A.S.E., directing it to admit him as a
member. The industrial groupers are
deeply concerned about losing control in
Gippsland, which controls Victoria’s
power, but Orr’s resigning from the
A.E.U. because it is dominated by Com-
munists can hardly help the D.L.P. cause.
The groupers won their successes by
joining Red-run unions.

Sir Keith Park, the Maorilander who
commanded the No. 11 Fighter Group
in the Battle of Britain, commented on
the claim of the Moscow official war
history that the Battle of Britain was
only a “smoke-screen” that but for the
battle Russia would have been steam-
rollered in 1941 as Poland was in 1939.
This is stark truth. Russia had no radar
in World War 11, scarcely any bombers
and only a few low-altitude fighters. If
the Battle of Britain and subsequent Lan-
caster bombing had not virtually
destroyed the heart of the Luftwaffe and
wrecked the German aircraft-industry,
there would have been no Leningrad,
Moscow or Kiev a month after June,
1941. But Hitler dared not use what
was left of his main air-force on the
eastern front.

Electricity cables under the English

man’s morning egg may be boiled by
power from melting Alpine snows and
that at times the Paris Metro trains may

To Sydney’s newly inducted Rotary
president, N. Bernard Freeman, the
movement’s “Service Above Self” should
present no problems. One way or another
he’s been doing good for other people
most of his life. He was born in Sydney
—at Paddington—in 1896, but his father,
a diamond-merchant, moved the family
to Hong Kong, where, at an Italian con-
vent, Bernard received the first of his
education, completed at a Footscray
(Melbourne) State school and Xavier
College, after they came south again in
1906.
Heading for War I with the 3rd Div.’s
38th Battalion, he was in England when they
were looking for recruits for the infant Aus-
tralian Flying Corps, got his wings by proving
he could handle the rickety Maurice Farnum
Longhorns (the pilot came before the engine
in these old pushers), and, posted to the
R.F.C., spent the remainder war mostly
patrolling England and chasing Zeppelins. _
Apres la guerre a chance meeting with a
war-time cobber decided the pattern of his
post-war career. His friend was off to the
U.S.A. to “try his luck” and Freeman decided
to join him, perhaps attracted by a letter
of introduction to Adolph Zukor that his
friend carried. This document was duly
presented in New York, where Paramount’s
FILMS
chief gave both young Australians a job.
Freeman got a good grounding in the movies,
then came back to Australia as Paramount’s
assistant general sales-manager, but within two
years threw this job in and returned to New
York, where he met Arthur Loew, a leading
luminary in what at the time was a new
venture calling itself Metro Goldwyn. Ottered
the chance of establishing the company in
Australia, Freeman jumped at it (soon after-
wards the colorful Louis B. Mayer got in on
the act and added his own monicker to the
now famous trade-name —incidentally, it was
Freeman who negotiated the sale of Bern-
borough from Romano to Mayer).
As managing-director here since 1925,
Bernard Freeman has done a notable job for
M.G.M., and, among other good works, has
been chairman of the successful Anzac House
Appeal and national chairman of the United
Nations Children’s Emergency Fund. Cur-
rently he is N.S.W. chairman of the World
Refugee Appeal, which has netted £160,000 to
date. His fine communal efforts all round
brought him a well-merited C.B.E. in 1956.
TV, he says, has made no impact on the >
exclusive M.G.M. circuit, nor does he fear
for the future of the industry as a whole.
He will tell you that M.G.M.’s policy is to
make good films (“Seen ‘Ben-Hur’ yet?”) and
that good films are attracting bigger audiences
than ever. In Australia, says Freeman, there’s
room for everybody who’s got something good
to offer.

On his first visit to N.S.W., J. Paul
Carroll his short-stories and other
writings on railway themes have been

made The Bulletin office his first stop.
Following his father, R. G. Carroll, who
used to contribute pars, to “Aboriginali-

“Ogidd,” J. Paul started writing pars,
under various pseudonyms (“3333,”
“Half-dirty” and “Noah”) and graduated
from these to his short-stories, which
have the minimum of puff and the maxi-
mum of punch.
Carroll (here pictured) of course knows

driver thereabouts for the last 20 years.
His advice to beginners is to concentrate
first on par.-writing, for the compactness,

at 36 he hopes to matriculate this year.
STORIES
After working with G. J. Coles and
Co. almost from the click of the first
threepence, sixpence and shilling, David
Davis has retired to take a long holiday
at his Victorian seaside home. Like so
many Coles men, he began as a store-
man ; when he retired he had been
executive buyer for the chain since 1955.
Davis was manager of Coles’s first
big city venture, the No. 4 in Bourke
Street, Melbourne, now occupied by
Belvilles ; the first three shops were at
Collingwood, Prahran and Brunswick.
In January, 1928, he opened the first
Coles store in Sydney—on premises in
Pitt Street rented from the Civil Service
Stores. With a selling policy of nothing
over half-a-crown and a rent of £5OO a
week, sage Sydneysiders forecast a year’s
expensive run for it. They were a little
astray. In these days he deliberated as
long over buying 100 dozen articles as,
before he retired, at purchasing 10,000
dozen.

“Ceg” recalls a famous first shot:
An historic occasion is recalled by the
death at'Queenscliff (Vic.) of Sergeant Charles
Reginald Carter.
Sergeant Carter, who served for over 40
years in the Royal Australian Artillery-
enlisting in 1901 —was No. 1 on the 6in.-gun
that fired the first Australian shot after war
had been declared in 1914. When the cable
from London was received during the morning
of August 5 saying that England and Germany
were at war, Headquarters in Melbourne
immediately telephoned the C. 0., R.A.A., at
Queenscliff, informing him that the German
steamer Pfalz had left Melbourne in an
effort to escape, and would soon be approach-
ing Port Phillip Heads. The steamer was to
be stopped and told to return to Melbourne.
As it happened, she had already passed
Portsea and would very soon have been
outside the Heads. However, the gun-crew
at Fort Nepean were quick to act, and a shot
was fired across her bows. That did the
trick; she stopped, turned back, and her crew
were interned.
Sergeant Carter, 79 at the end, served in
the South African war with the 2nd Con-
tingent Victorian Mounted Rifles, under
Colonel Tom Price. This regiment left Mel-
bourne on January 13, 1900, in the Euralyus,
arriving at the Cape on February 5. It joined
in the advance, under Lord Roberts, up through
the Orange Free State and took part in the
capture 'of Bloemfontein.
The old fort at Queenscliff is now used
as the Australian Staff College. The moat
has been fil!ed-in, but the musketry embrasures
in the surrounding brick walls remain. In
this atomic age I doubt whether that could
be regarded as disclosing military secrets.

Faced with the job of producing a
producer to put on Mozart’s “Marriage
of Figaro” for Sydney Stage Club’s
Opera School, and finding likely takers
as scarce as hens’ teeth, Douglas Parnell
decided to have a stab at it himself, and
made such an artistic success of it that
the season has had to be spun-out weeks
beyond the original intention. Not so
surprising a triumph, though—as an
opera-singer Parnell has had a whale of a
lot of experience. A product of Adelaide’s
Elder Conservatorium, where he gained
the Aggregate Prize with eight firsts
before going on to win the Ballarat
Eisteddfod* he went to England in 1948.
There he battled round in musicomedies
and even pantos before his rich-quality,
power-plus bass-baritone projected him
on to the Covent Garden stage, where
for three years he expanded his already
respectable role-repertoire. Back in Aus-
tralia, he stepped into leading roles in
several seasons of National Opera. Nowa-
days, in his capacity of schoolteacher, he
passes his knowledge of music on to the
OPERA
next generation. There’s an achievement
of a rather different kind in his back-
ground—as an old first-grade Australian
Rules footballer, his The Australian Foot-
ball Book is the accepted textbook for
the code.

ABORIGINALITIES
THE RIVER BOATS
An historical society formed at Echuca
(Vic.) plans to buy and preserve a
river-steamer of the type common on
the Murray some 85 years ago, when
Echuca was the second port to Mel-
bourne. A party of members who, with
Jhis in view, spent a weekend travelling
down-river as far as Murray Bridge were
surprised to find many old-timers still
afloat, though only about 2 per cent, were
what the used-car trade calls “goers/’
At Boundary Bend they found the
Etona, which, according to legend, was
originally bought by the boys of Eton
College to spread the gospel among the
heathens of Australia, and later achieved
fame because Lord - Montgomery spent
a holiday aboard her. The working-boat
Rothbury—once one of the fastest on
the river—and the fishing-boat Canberra
are at Mildura. The Rothbury, built at
Gunbower in 1881, was reputed to be
able to snap a 6in. rope-hawser from
a standing start. Despite this, she lost
a famous towing-match against the South
Australian, staged on the Darling near
Wilcannia during the ’nineties ; but that
was due to bad staff-work by the fireman,
who in his excitement inadvertently
poked the fire, with the result that the
boat lost steam.
Sawmillers at Paringa now own the
Adelaide, built at Echuca in 1866 and
used there for years as a timber-boat,
while the Oscar W., built at Echuca
half-a-century later and named for the
son of its owner-skipper, Capt. F. O.
Wallin, has been used for years at
Morgan as a S.A. Government river-
boat. The Marion, a paddle-steamer built
in 1897, is now a houseboat at Berri;
the Avoca is doing day - trips around
Murray Bridge (having been converted
to a diesel-electric with motors formerly
used by the S.A. Tramways); and the
Connawarra, converted from a barge
some 10 years ago, is a Mildura show-
boat.
Few of the steamers retain their

original line or fittings, and some con-
verted to houseboats would not be
recognised by early owners, notably the
Enterprise, at Mannum ; she has been
lavishly refitted with brass handrails and
stair-treads, and is even equipped with
venetian-blinds. The Echuca party saw
other boats, some in poor condition but
still reclaimable, but many more derelict
or well on the way to it. Most notable
was the 92-year-old Gem, once the
biggest boat on the river. Stripped of
engines, the 130 - footer now lies at
Mildura, where her eight-foot steering-
wheel still impresses the tourists.

Because I smiled and saw ,
afternoon” to a colored
who gravely replied, “Gooa jO
noon,” I was invited to an f
wedding. The second-daughter
STEIGLITZ
When / was young, black-bearded men
Came striding down this mountain street,
The miners wore white moleskins then
With blucher boots upon their feet
And all day long the bright picks swung
On Steiglitz hills when I was young.
And there, still dreaming in the sun
Of wilder days, stands Morgans Knob
Where boy-like once I thought it fun
To imitate “the rowdy mob” ;
My craggy father’s Cornish tongue
Bit like a lash when l was young.
And here, oh lovely vanished sight,
My mother laughing to and fro
And through the crisp and frosty night
My brothers homing in a row,
With love and peace like banners hung
Inside the door when l was young.
Hardly a ruin now remains
To show where stores and shanties stood,
On rubble-heaps the bramble canes
Defy the dark advancing wood
And only bush-birds’ songs are sung
Down tracks that roared when / was
young.

The old nark says he can only take two of us —so We'll have to toss."


me the invitation, and I scurried out
to buy a present before the shops
shut, as the wedding was next day.
I sent the gift round with a card,
but I learnt later that I had not
observed Island etiquette —I should have
taken it to the church and then on to
the reception, where the bridal couple
received their gifts at the door. After a
sumptuous feast, the few white guests
were asked to leave, and to return in the
evening for the dancing. Under a spread-
ing mango-tree I watched part of the
Island ceremony, in which the bride, in all
her finery of white nylon and veil, sat on
the floor with her mother and opened
the presents, both crying all the time.
For the dance at night the bride changed
into a fashionable pink evening - dress
with pink-satin shoes to match, although
she never wore shoes at any other time.
Her bridegroom led the men, who danced
proudly and well; to show their appre-
ciation, the ladies flitted among them,
"Hey, Mum! Can Greg have A cake, too ?”
sprinkling their shoulders liberally with
scented talcum - powder. The orchestra
was the voices of the dancers and
audience, with the beat of New Guinea
drums and kerosene - tins. Pressure-
lanterns served as footlights, and in the
surrounding darkness highlighted the
gleaming black bodies in white athletic
singlets and scarlet lava-lavas, with crim-
son hibiscus in their thick, black, woolly
hair. The dancing went on nearly all
night, but early in the morning the guests
and bridal party were at the Church of
England to receive communion.—“ Wild
Violet.”

“Dicky”: “I was going to get her a
new saddle for the show,” he remarked
as his small daughter rode into the ring,
“but I felt she’d had an exciting enough
week as it was, what with her cat having
kittens and her mother having a baby.”
TV/TcWhiskers, expecting a telegram
-f**- from a city firm about harvester
parts, received one that obviously
wasn’t intended for him. Disregarding
the bush post-office, he rode 15 miles to
the nearest centre and wired the har-
vester people: “Don’t understand tele-
gram. Think you must have put message
in wrong envelope.”—“Dash D.”

“Sevenelms”: Not all timbermen
would endorse “Gravelsnatcher’s” dis-
missal of Westralia’s jamwood as a
timber-tree because he has not felled
any big enough to yield 9in.-boards (B.
20 /7 / ’6O). Any such size-criterion for
“timber-class” could disqualify lignum-
vitae, which is world marketed in logs
4ft.-long and under lOin.-diameter. I
well remember combing the Central
Americas to get one plump enough to
produce 2ft. of 9in. by Hin. for the base-
plate of a hide-rolling machine at a
Melbourne tannery. “G.” asks who
would know if there was a prevalence
of fiddleback in this Acacia acuminata?
Surely any timberman worth his salt
whose glance rested on the tree from a
distance of one chain or less!

“Ymar”: After battling through the
mud to a council-meeting, a Dunmunkle
(Vic.) councillor was emphatic about the
need for bitumen on the approaches to
the shire - offices. “But,” the assistant-
engineer assured him, “the bitumen is
there. It’s just a question of finding it
under the mud!”
* * * *
“Mugga Way”: In a former sea, in
what is now north-western Queensland
and part of the Northern Territory, there
are some fossils of primitive plants,
stromatolites, which flourished during the
Lower Proterozoic era. For thos
ignorant persons who don’t know wheo
that was, the Bureau of Mineral R e .
sources, announcing the find of t nt
fossils, explains that it was ‘'at l easi
1000-million years ago,” or about twice
as long ago as when the oldest-known
shelled animals lived during the Cam.
brian period. The plants built reef-like
colonies, and their fossil remains are
regarded as a valuable guide to the great
antiquity of vegetable-life.

“Wandana”: When a three-man %
ing-boat from Melbourne, working out
in Bass Strait, got into difficulties and
dragged her anchor the skipper was
knocked unconscious by the revolving
winch-handle. A second man was laid-
out likewise on deck, and the third mem-
ber of the crew just managed to stop
heavy waves washing the other two over
the side. The 250-ton auxiliary trading-
ketch Loatta took the smaller craft in
charge and escorted it to Melbourne. It
could easily have been another unsolved
mystery of the sea.

“Judee”: A young apprentice arrived
at the works sporting a sweater of
violent apricot. Cracked the workshop-
wit: “Troubled by fruit-fly lately?”

Mention in these pages of Jack Hal's
whip still hanging on the wall of
the pub at Bedourie which hamlet,’
right on the edge of the Simpson Desert,
has one pub and 11 people —held s
special appeal for me.
In 1901 I was horse-boy for Jack. Wij
were minding cattle for Kidman oil
Moncoonie Lake. Jack was, as stated
a wonderful horseman, but he was also
a great nark, and no aboriginal “boys
would stay with him. I got on well will
him because, as he could not read or
write, I used to read the papers to him
I was camped around the same camp
fire as Jack for about a year. He war
head stockman at Marion Downs on®
Georgina for 13 years and knew the W
word about cattle. In 1902 Jack and
with a blackboy named Dooblum, wen 1
up the Mulligan into the Simps oll
Desert and brought back 180 fat cat®
that had strayed away —a tough trip.
Fifty years later, when I v ’ s j te
Bedourie, the pub was kept by »
Gaffney, and there I saw Jack’s sp-
whip hanging up in the bar. That o
custom of former times is mentioned
an old ballad:
There is his saddle on the tie-beam
And his spurs upon the wall,
Of all the men who came mustering
He was the daddy of them all■
I asked whose whip it was, and
they told me whose it was, I told
all about him, and that I’d en ,
horse-boy. I' was allowed, with 5 ,
ceremony, to take the whip down
handle it —the only man, they said,
to have that honor!

“Phil Anthus”: In all the wordage that
been spilled over the threat of the
Mayor of Nyngan (N.S.W.) to horse-
whip a newspaper-editor, no one has
told us what gave his Worship the idea
that a whip, rather than (say) a branch-
jet from a coolibah-tree, was the appro-
priate weapon. Perhaps he was aware
that an outback editor actually had been
publicly horsewhipped nearly 80 years
ag()! as witness The Bulletin of
January 22, 1881:
A telegram from Blackall informs us
that the editor of the “Western Champion”
has been publicly horsewhipped in that
town by Mr. Skuthorpe for having, in its
issue of Friday last, cast doubts on the
veracity of the latter gentleman in regard
to the alleged discovery of relics of the
Leichhardt expedition.
Later, The Bulletin itself cast heavy
doubts on the claims made by “Black
Dick” Skuthorpe, but somehow its editor
escaped the whip. Maybe this can be
used to proper advantage only in the free
spaces, such as Blackall and Nyngan.

“Euroclydon”: Fifty years ago Dad
lost five sovereigns he was bringing
home for housekeeping: “I just slipped
them into my top waistcoat-pocket,” he
said sadly. With Mum’s opinion that
he had just slipped them into his vacant
intellect, the old man went out to rug
the pony. Doing that, he was startled to
hear the clink of gold at the pony’s feet.
He had slipped the sovs. into the armhole
of his waistcoat, and there he had carried
them tightly all day until his arms up-
raised with the horse-rug had released
them.

“Q. Ree” (Fiji): As our optometrist in
Lautoka often works in his back-room

r, gged-up a bell, operated by a radio-
wave which rings the bell when people
walk through. He says the Fijians get
P ven more fun out of it than the

to maintain a steady trickle of grain and
make the bag last the journey. We drove
into the saleyards one grunt and about

“Brick E.”: When I first started in
the trade one small-time builder was
known as “Three-strokes.” The story
went that, walking around the job after
knock - off, he found a _ piece of tim-
ber almost cut through. He sought the
carpenter responsible and sacked him.
“Three strokes!” he roared. “Just three
strokes with the saw would have cut
that end off, and if a man can’t give me
three more strokes after knock-off time
he’s no good to me.” What a difference
today! The trump who found a chippy
willing to start on another cut so close
to knock-off time would wonder where
the catch came in.

TALKING-BIRDS
Come 40 years ago Sydney’s best-known
talking - bird was the defeathered
Tom Ugly’s Point cockatoo of what is
now the Sea Breeze Hotel, with his con-
stant advertising of his blankey intention
to fly if he had “another blankey
feather!” However, his vocabulary was
limited, and I don’t think his I.Q. would
hav v e been anywhere as high as that of
one named Stringy Bark Cockatoo,
whose imitating of a bullock-driver and
thereby wrecking a bullock - team was
told in The Bulletin years ago in a
ballad illustrated by Leason.
Probably Stringy was the same bird
that I knew early in the present century,
and about which the late Harry Horne
wrote a ballad. This particular cocky,
perched on the front-veranda of a sly-
grog shop at Stringy Bark, in the Gul-
gong (N.S.W.) district, had an uncanny
ability to recognise shanty-raiding plain-
clothes cops. As the ballad said: “This
wily old bird, he knew, he knew, and
could pick out the trap by his horse’s
shoe.”
Not far away, at Leadville, lived
another famous bird, Sandy Mason’s
Crow. Sandy was a hotelkeeper, and the
bird haunted the public-bar. The wisdom
of this feathered sage was reputed as so
great that “If there’s anything at all you
want to know, just pop the question to
Mason’s Crow.” I must confess that at
my first interview with him, when, out
of curiosity, I wanted to know if he
thought it would rain, he shot back:
“Go home, you’re drunk!”
In the same locality, at a shanty that
stood where the outskirts of Dunedoo
are today, was Old George’s Cockatoo.
This fellow, though, fell-down on the
job one wet winter’s night when two
plainclothes-men arrived with the story
that one of them had been nearly
drowned when they were swimming their
horses across the flooded Talbragar. In
the end they persuaded Old George to
sell them a bottle of rum, which cost
that shantykeeper a £5O-fine. George
counted-out 50 sovereigns, then warmly
thanked the magistrate for the fine
advertisement: “Not many knew that I
sold it; now everyone knows and busi-
ness will boom!”

KEEPING UP WITH THE COLESES
A T the weekend the battle
between G. J. Coles and
Co. and Woolworths for a 51
p.c. holding in Matthews,
Thompson and Co., Ltd.,
N.S.W. chain-grocers, was still
“fluid,” on a shifting front,
with the initiative still mostly
in Coles’s corner.
But after the early upsurge
in M., T. shares following the
swift bid and counter-bid on
August 3, there was a drop in
the market-price of scrip in all
three participants (especially
G. J. Coles), and possibilities of
further changes in the market
added a touch of quicksilver
to a position that had previ-
ously appeared, in the eyes of
M., T. shareholders, almost all
golden.
It has been a major take-
over battle, with offers reaching
into the £8 - million - to - £lO -
million category, and is indica-
tive of major developments in
the chain-store business. How-
ever, the tremendous urge to
expand indicated by both sides
has left the investment market
wondering a little.
There is a developing ten-
dency to “take the cash in
hand” by selling M., T. shares
now, and waiving the rest.
/~\n July 20, following the
offer for the shares in
Matthews, Thompson by G. J.
Coles and Co. which outbid the
original offer of Woolworths,
Theo Kelly, managing-director
of Woolworths, said that his
directors had “decided not to
become involved in any auc-
tion” for control of Matthews,
Thompson.
However, as the Coles offer
was to remain open for/ three
months, “during that period
there will be a better oppor-
tunity to assess the merits of
any offers, having regard to the
relative market-value of the
shares of the companies con-
cerned, and to any other factors
which may influence the posi-
tion.”
Later G. J. Coles and Co.
shortened the period in which
its offer could be accepted
from three months (up till
October 18) to August 31. It
was prepared to accept 51 p.c.
acceptance. It reserved the
right to extend the offer beyond
August 31.
Then on August 3 Theo
Kelly, managing-director of
Woolworths, announced that
his board had reconsidered its
offer.
He referred particularly to
the shortening of time of
“Many happy returns —get it ?”
acceptance by G. J. Coles from
three months to a month. He
said this denied shareholders
the opportunity to assess more
fully the respective offers in
the light of the non-availability
of the accounts for the year
ended June 30, 1960, for both
G. J. Coles and Co. and
Matthews, Thompson and Co.
and the preliminary statement
of Woolworths for the half
year ended July 31, 1960.
Further, the assessment was
made more difficult because G.
J- Coles has not confirmed that
its 11 p.c. div. would be paid
on the enlarged capital follow-
ing the three-for-10 issue, and
as to when such issue was to
take place.
Mr. Kelly said that the
unanimous acceptance of his
original offer by the directors
of Matthews, Thompson indi-
cated that such offer was a
fair and reasonable one. How-
ever, having regard to all the
circumstances subsequent to its
original offer, the board had
decided, in the company’s best
interests, to make a variation
in its offer “which would still
be economical and ensure that
Woolworths present increasing
earning-rate would in no way
be retarded.”
The new offer was:
One Woolworths ordinary share
of ss. each, plus 3s. in- cash, for
each ordinary of ss. each in
Matthews, Thompson.
Four Woolworths ords. of ss.
each, plus 12s. in cash, for
each participating first-preference
share of £1 in Matthews, Thompson.
The offer to the second preis.
unchanged.
The closing-date was ex-
tended from August 22 to
August 31, 1960, “or such later
date as Woolworths may
agree.”
Woolworths would proceed
with the purchase of the scrip
in Matthews, Thompson when
applications were received from
at least 51 p.c. of the ordinary
capital.
This offer added 3s. cash per
Matthews, Thompson ord. to
the original offer by Wool-
worths.
YX/Tthin '9O minutes of the
* amended Woolworths offer,
G. J. Coles and Co. put in an-
other offer.
The previous offer by G. J.
Coles was in ord. shares (basic-
ally five for four) which would
not participate in a pending
new issue, of three-for-10.
The amended offer granted
those M., T, sharehola
accepting the Coles oft
right to participate in theY
share-issue. e ne
. Full Particulars of the nei
week are bem§ announc ed th
Following the G. J r,
amended offer Mr K P n,, e
Woolworths, said his
had no intention of a„J
the offer it had made earl
the same day.
With that, it looked *
though G. J. Coles had won t
day, and was well on the wa
to acquire the 248-unit grocery,
chain. But Wool worths were
still open to do business with
M., T. shareholders, subject to
a 51 p.c. acceptance.
Apart from cash, the share-
consideration payable by G. J,
Coles would be nearly
lion ss. ords., cum rights to I
three-for-10 par issue in \%[
Following the offer, G, I
Coles ords. changed hands at
19s. 6d., Matthews, Thompson
ords. at 21s. 6d. On Thursday
of last week G. J. Coles ords,
dropped to 17s. 6d., Wool
worths to around the same
figure, and Matthews, Thomp-
son to 20s. 3d. There wasi
slight firming on Friday.
The Coles Telegram
From F. X. McMahon, on
behalf of G. J. Coles ni
Coy., Ltd., 236 Bourke Street
Melbourne:
There was a material inaccuW
in The Bulletin’s article on pi?
21, issue of July 27. Sir Ed®’
Coles is not the chairman d

Sir Kenneth Coles, resideit
director in Sydney, occupies I
position, and it was through to
that the Coles board made its

director and resident in Melbourne
He extended his personal *
gratulations in complete sin*
to his friendly rival, Mr. 1*

That the Coles nine-men
board should re-evaluate the F

profitable TV-station in Aus-
ralia to date, being run at
lower cost than other compar-
able stations.
Curiously, GTV9, Mel-
bourne, has had a fairly close
programme relationship with
TCN’s commercial opposition
in Sydney— ATN7, controlled
by the “Sydney Morning
Herald” group. There is much
speculation as to how this
relationship will now work out.
Sale of Electronic Industries’
shares in GTV9 was forced by
an amendment to the Broad-
casting and Television Act
which prohibited the owner-
ship of more than 20 p.c. of
an Australian TV-station by an
overseas company. Pye, of
England, controls Electronic
Industries, and therefore, in-
directly, controlled GTV9.
In order to finance the pur-
chase of the 627,441 shares

poration (a 62j p.c. interest)
from the Electronic people at
£6 a share, payable £2,264,646
in cash and £1,500,000 in 7{ p.c.
notes (repayable at £300,000

tion, Ltd., is making an issue
of 966,000 1 os. shares at a
premium of 40s. a share to its
own shareholders. The ratio
is one-for-two.
This will bring in £2,415,000

that some of its production will

year even with present output.
Meanwhile the plant at Gee-
long has proved unable to cope
with the Victorian demand, and
capacity is to be lifted by
300,000 tons to around 800,000
tons a year.
Kandos Cement, Ltd., and
Australian Cement Ltd., are
equal partners in Australian
Portland Cement Pty., Ltd.,
which controls the plants at
Kandos and Geelong. It is by
far the biggest cement-produc-
ing group in the Common-
wealth. Although it was origin-
ally thought that the new
Kandos plant could be financed
out of internal funds, in June
this year both holding-cos. an-
nounced a one-for-four issue
at par, bringing in, in total,
about £570,000.
A further issue may or may
not be necessary to finance the
Geelong extensions. Ploughed-
back profits could conceivably
be adequate for the job.
Cuming Smith
Celling at 465. in Melbourne,
the £1 ord. shares in Cum-
ing Smith look cheap as a
proposition for the investor
who is prepared to wait three
or four years for benefits. They
sold up to 58s. earlier this year.
The co. continues to pay 8
p.c. dividends in spite of in-
creasing competition in the
Australian fertiliser industry.
Australia is the largest user of
phosphatic fertilisers in the
British Commonwealth, and
between 1950 and 1958 there
was a 40 p.c. increase in the
quantity used. It seems likely
that usage of fertilisers will
continue to grow, especially in
years when seasons are
favorable. Pasture - improve-
ment is necessary in large areas
of Australia.
Cuming Smith is, directly
and indirectly, a large share-
holder in 1.C.1.A.N.Z., and this
holding at present has a market-
value in excess of 355. per
Cuming Smith share. Which
puts a very low value indeed
on the Cuming Smith fertiliser
empire, spread through Vic-
toria, Queensland, W.A. and,
to a lesser extent, N.S.W-
There are 1,600,000 shares
issued in Cuming Smith, all in
£1 ordinaries.
N.K.S. Holdings
TPhe £1 shares in N.K.S. Hold-
ings, Ltd., have moved up
to a peak price of 28s. 6d. in
the past few days. Earlier this
year they sold as low as 235.
When around 245. 9d. in
March they were mentioned
here as having “a potential for
holding purposes, and in the
meantime give a satisfactory
yield of 6.5 p.c. on an 8 p.c.
div. basis.”
In April last the co. sold its
half-interest (750,000)'£1 shares
in Noyes (Aust.), Ltd., to
Crompton, Parkinson (Eng.)
for £656,250 cash, and in doing
so shed an investment that had
been a non-contributor to
profits ever since the flotation
of N.K.S. in 1954.
The N.K.S. Holdings group
is now made up of the mer-
chandising company, Knox
Schlapp Pty., and subsidiaries,
and the manufacturing off-
shoots, Ogden Industries Pty.,
Metalex Pty., Australian Die
Castings Pty. and N.K.S.
Laboratories Pty. A condition
of the sale of the Noyes (Aust.)
shares was that the distribution
rights of products of the manu-
facturing cos. previously held
under agreement by the Noyes
companies would revert to

The “French Team's” Oil-
search
IFrom “H. Yona”]
“Early in April of this year
the oil-search industry in
Australia was startled to learn
that the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment had contracted with
the Petroleum Institute of
France, a French Government
company, for the latter to
conduct a survey of the oil
possibilities of Australia.
High up in the Govern-
ment triangle a basic deci-
sion had been made which
demanded brilliance rather
than adequacy in searching for
Australia’s as yet undiscovered
oil. The result of the decision
was the arrival from France of
a team of three, led by Dr.
Daniel Trumpy, a mature,
Swiss-born and -educated geo-
logist.
Comment on the arrival of
the “French” team was varied.
Several of the metropolitan
dailies applauded the move,
believing that the Europeans
would bring some information
and techniques to the problems
not available to those already
on the scene. Local operators
and contractors took a negative
attitude —a kind of “we can
do it ourselves” stance. The
loudest noises came from those
promoting a particular area or
exploration method. They
feared that a neutral voice
might disagree with their
claims, with subsequent loss of
prestige and influence to them-
selves. Some of the American
operators, while having little
complaint about the French
survey in principle, feared that
in some way it .might prejudice
the interests of American com-
panies.
Of one thing we can be
certain —no radical or rapid
changes in exploration methods
will result from the work of
the French team. To investi-
gate this remark we need look
into the background of Dr.
Trumpy and the French Petro-
leum Institute.
Press - releases tended to
glorify the French Petroleum
Institute and to ascribe to it
some mystical power for find-
ing oil in areas previously
thought to be barren. But Dr.
Trumpy, in interviews reported
on in various capital-cities,
refused to allow himself to be
drawn into the game which
may be titled, “It is only a
question of when.” He was
very careful not to make bullish
statements, taking the stand
that any conclusions he mi k
reach must be reported Jf
client, the Federal Go
ment, and it was then c
berra’s job to report to h
nation.
For many years s
geologists have been enter!,
oil-exploration work f or
world - wide companies 2
many have risen to matJ
ment positions.
This is due to the well-known
Swiss qualities of hard wort
and thoroughness. The Swiss
are also very practical, and are
very careful concerning what
they say and especially in what
they write. Dr. Trumpy j.
this school.
Professionally, Dr. Trumpy
has worked for many y eats
with the Shell group and is a
practical oil-man with the ex-
perience which can only he
gained by working for con-
siderable periods in many
countries.
Now in his sixties, and pen-
sioned by Shell, Dr. Trumpj
has undertaken his present
position with the French Petro-
leum Institute because he still
is in love with oil-exploration
work. He knows that he and his
colleagues brought to Austra-
lia open minds and the tech-
nical ability to evaluate in-
formation. These are their
only secret weapons. But in
Australia they are major ones,
The preliminary conclusions
reached by Dr. Trumpy prior
to his departure from Australia
were recently released by the
Federal Government. Three
basins in Western Australia
and one chiefly in the Northern
Territory were singled out as
having greatest hopes for suc-
cess. It was pointed out that
the investigation had still to
cover certain areas, so perhaps
it would be wise to wait for a
final report, which should he
due in less than a year. The
practical results of the French
report will have the effect of
focusing oil-search activities,
utilising existing tools and
methods. This will be a slow,
but probably sure, process.
Serious investors in °“'
exploration in Australia have
been severely curtailed by *
lack of unbiased information'
Rumors, tips, fantastic claims
and unfounded hopes are con-
tinually being tossed to the
public. The findings of ®
team from the French Pc tr °'
leum Institute will enable tn
true investor to back
companies operating in ar . e3i

Sydney Art
Sydney’s most surprising—
and pleasing —art-exhibition of
the week is Daryl Hill’s at the
Macquarie Galleries. Hill
paints eyes floating in space,
which are not exactly new these
days, but he has a delicacy of
touch and imagination that is
all his own and he is a rarity
among the painters who come
young (usually too young) to
town in that there is no doubt
whatever about his craftsman-
ship.
He is also a rarity in that he
makes the journey into space
neither merely mechanical as it
often is among the abstract-
painters nor nightmarish as it
is among the surrealists, but
poetical, fanciful, even delight-
ful. There seem to be Ariels
in this painter’s universe, not
merely wheels or demons.
It must be said, though,
that whether he calls his works
"Blue-brown Image,” “Sisy-
phus,” or “Billabong,” Hill has
painted, virtually, only one
painting ; or, at most, two.
Sometimes it looks like an eye ;
and sometimes it looks like the
eye in a peacock-feather. And
the content, because most of it
1S space, is slight enough.
But the color is lovely ; the
placing of the “images” is most
effective; the eyes and the
leathers whirl along at quite
remarkable speed; and there
are not lacking proofs, as in
the hot desert-colors of “Float-
J n §> that Hill will be able to
ravel in other directions when
he wants to.

mostly rather formless
struggles, as if he had hurled
himself at the canvas and then
didn’t know what to do. Some,
such as “Impetuous Song,” are
pleasing in color and move-
ment ; but he is best when, as
in “Silver Descending,” which
seems to be a bush waterfall,
he has stood back from his
work and had a look at some-
thing.
Albert N. Clarke and Victor
Cusack, at Anthony Hordern’s
Aranda Room, have a modest
little show of “traditional”
landscapes. This commenta-
tor has never seen why an
artist should be obliged to paint
Nothing if he prefers to paint
Something; only the Some-
thing needs to be put down
with more finesse than it is in
most of these little scenes.
Cusack has almost caught
a mood of the Harbor with
sensitivity in “Storm over Brad-
ley’s”; otherwise Albert Clarke,
who is known for his drawings
of old Sydney, is the more
capable of the two. His tech-
nique in watercolors enables
him to paint a scene freshly
and, though his oils usually
fall just short of his aims, one
or two, such as “Harborside
Walk” and “C hin a m a n’s
Beach” are also attractive.

Australians in London
Two other Melbourne
painters have joined Sidney
Nolan in bringing modern
Australian art under the
interested gaze of London
critics. They are Arthur Boyd,
whose strangely stylised pic-
tures of brides and aboriginal
’grooms, with their overtones
of Chagall, are well known
here ; and Albert Tucker, who
left Australia about 12 years
ago and has since exhibited in-
England, Holland, France,
Italy and the U.S. (where, in
New York, he would seem to
have enjoyed most success so
far).
Describing Tucker’s latest
London exhibition, which
covers the past three years of
his work, “Time and Tide”
critic P. M. T. Sheldon-
Williams notes that “his paint-
ings are big, cumbersome —
no fancy penthouse furniture
here”:
“For this Australian artist,
success is slow but steady.
These pictures are statements
of Australia, stripping off the
thin 20th-century veneer and
displaying a scarred rock
landscape or a pulverised
desert. There is nothing
folksey or colonial about these
imports. Nor are they pale
echoes of European or Ameri-
can modern art. This kind of
painting is a mature distilla-
tion of environment, an up-
rooted and transplanted
tradition and the weirdness of
the other side of the world.”
Boyd’s pictures, the same
writer notes, “have so many
European overtones that even
a catalogue-note about his
indebtedness to the Melbourne
countryside fails to awaken in
English eyes a reaction of
strangeness from another land.
The oddities and shocks are
familiar from Vitebsk-via-
Paris and Munich. Familiar,
and therefore acceptable.
“It seems that the genuine
Australian, the unvarnished
pill without European coating,
is still too bizarre a taste for
our Western palates. Cer-
tainly, Australians who strike
a recognisable note —Nolan
and Boyd are good examples —
get a keen response from
British amateurs. Tucker,
with his uncompromising
search for a terra Australis
identity, must wait for the go-
ahead from New York.”
Tucker, it is said, will shortly
return to Australia to tour the
capitals with a retrospective
exhibition of his work.
Stage and Music
“The Hostage”
If a story about the Irish
troubles by Liam O’Flaherty or
Sean O’Faolain were freely
adapted for the stage by a com-
passionate music-hall writer
and heavily revised by the
authors of the Goon Show the
result might well resemble
Brendan Behan’s second play
—the last offering of the Trust
Players’ 1960 season at Sydney
Elizabethan.
The description is only very
approximate. It might suggest
the peculiarly nutty flavor of
the piece; it might even
account for the occasional in-
trusion of stale jokes ; but it
can give practically no idea of
Behan’s intensely personal and
generous view of life.
As to what exactly that view
is, one guess is as good as an-
other. Of all the institutions
mentioned or involved in the
play—the Irish Government,
the 1.R.A., the British Govern-
ment, the Church, even the
Irish as a nation —not one
comes out of it well. What it
seems to celebrate is the human
spirit in its ability to go on
loving and joking and singing,
no matter how you knock it
around with injustice, puritan-
ism, fanaticism. Or perhaps
you could take it as an image
of a world in which this spirit
struggles for its life amid grand
causes that have either lost a
leg, gone queer, taken to drink
or become the property of the
life-deniers and kill-joys. Or
perhaps ...
To offset this guesswork with
some information, the plot
concerns a young English
soldier who is kidnapped by
the I.R.A. and held in a Dub-
lin brothel as a hostage against
the execution of an Irish rebel
in the north. After a rousing
evening with harlots, pansies
and run-down rebels and some
tender moments with a fresh
girl from the country he is
killed, ironically, in a raid in-
tended to rescue him.
Behan scarcely attempts to
raise any tension out of these
events ; rather he uses them as
a sort of carry-all into which he
bundles yet another set of
sketches, “turns,” stories and
arguments about anything the
situation suggests to him —
which means plenty. Bawdy,


tender, cynical, lyrical, he
shuffles it along, freely using
songs and dances that halt
rather than advance the action,
creating a fine sense of free
improvisation without ever
quite losing his way, but, it
seems, continually throwing
dramatic unity to the winds of
vaudeville, so that the play,
taken purely as a play, is always
in danger of amounting to
something less than the sum of
its many wonderfully written
parts.
Clearly it needs a producer
who can devise for it a strong
and definite style to fuse its
sometimes conflicting elements
into a coherent and continuous
A moment from the Trust Players’ production of “The Hostage” (Sydney Elizabethan).
whole. Robin Lovejoy, that
most resourceful producer, has
attacked this problem with con-
siderable success. A fore-stage
with stairs into the orchestra-
pit did much to keep the scenes
flowing ; the sets and costumes,
by Wendy Dickson, heightened
reality with economy of means ;
selective lighting altered stage-
perspectives, Brecht - wise, for
the songs and dances ; a piano
and a violin gave appropriate
back-parlor accompaniment.
Most of the actors carried
these same qualities of reality
enlarged, and sometimes
knocked sideways, into their
performances. Lewis Fiander,
as the Cockney hostage, and
Patricia Conolly, as the coun-
try girl who fleetingly loves
him, were particularly fine.
One won’t easily forget the lost
little love-scene they worked-
out together, or the sheer
fascination of Miss Conolly’s
singing:
So open the window softly,
For Jaysus’ sake hang the latch.
Come in and lie down and after-
wards
You can ask me what’s the catch.
Frank Taylor was effective
as the keeper of the bawdy-
house, though possibly this one-
legged rebel from way back
(and way out) should emerge
more broadly and richly. Des
Rolfe, as a bowler-hatted civil
servant who had once gone
wrong, and Ron Haddrick, as
a sort of Anglo-Irish Major
Bloodnok with kilts, spiked
helmet and Gaelic bagpipes,
were both excellent. Madeleine
Howell had an engaging
approach to the role of the
spinster social - worker who
becomes more of a sociable
worker as the hours and drinks
go by ; but she was very short
of voice for the songs. An
occasional lack of clarity
marred Neva Carr Glyn’s other-
w,se sound work as the old
rebel s wife.

Tzipine and Rostropovich
. The two main works selected
by French conductor Georges
Tzip j ne f or his concer t with
the Sydney Orchestra last
Saturday night, both from the
pens of his compa triots, de-
manded sensitiveness and re-
strained emotion rather than
dynamism, and in the main
these attributes were rarely
found wanting.
Sensitiveness is certainly im-
perative in interpreting Chaus-
son’s only symphony. A highly
personal work, it reflects not
only the high ideals at which
the composer aimed and always
despaired of achieving but also
the timidity of his approach to
music. Spirituality —doubtless
derived from the influence of
his teacher Cesar Franck —is its
guiding motive ; yet behind its
seeming fragility is a certain
tensile strength. Tzipine drew
a readily sympathetic response
from his forces to achieve in
major degree the true essence
of the symphony, and among
notable contributions were the
discourse by the English-horn
with the ’cellos against the
arpeggio strings in the middle
movement, and the work of
trumpet and combined wood-
winds in the opening phases of
the final section,

AN AUTHORISED TRUSTEE INVESTMENT IN N.S.W.,
QUEENSLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA
THE SYDNEY WATER BOARD LOAN
Underwritten by lan Potter & Co.
and unstable youth who is
cheating, stealing and lying his
way into delinquency—plays
truant to visit an amusement-
park and takes a ride in a
giant wooden centrifuge-barrel.
As the barrel begins to spin,
centrifugal force pushes him to
the outer walls. The speed in-
creases, and soon he can move
neither forward nor back-
ward. He is the prisoner of
the machine, just as outside of
it he is the prisoner of society.
He is utterly powerless to
affect the forces of either con-
ditioning influence, and he
behaves accordingly. There is
only one way to freedom (or
at least a sense of it), he learns,
and that is through unnatural
means: by working his body
along the wall upside-down ...
what this implies is obvious.
Truffaut, who also wrote the
script, clearly holds those forces
outside Antoine’s control en-
tirely responsible for the boy’s
anti-social behavior. But his
blame does not remain focused
on abstract society.
In the end Antoine escapes
from a bleak “Observation
Centre” to which his parents
have sent him, and runs and
runs until at last he reaches the
cold, unresponsive sea and finds
that he can go no further.
Again he has collided with
the impenetrable, inescapable
walls of the centrifuge.
Forlorn and helpless he turns
back towards the camera. And
suddenly all movement —of the
sea, of the boy —is frozen.
The image of the bitter,
frightened boy is thrust for-
ward, expanding to fill the
screen. In a split-second it has
assumed the appearance, of one
of those slightly sordid police
identity-photographs, and there
can be no doubt as to Truffaut’s
intention. He wants us to
realise that the problem he has
been dramatising is our prob-
lem ; that we are all inextric-
ably involved in the social
processes that produce such
“misfits” as Antoine ; that our
consciences cannot, should not,
rest until the negative values of
our Antoines are replaced by
positive ones.
The moment of stunned,
almost hurt silence which
followed this, the film’s closing
shot, suggested that Truffaut
had made his point.

Goodyear Tyre & Rubber Co.
rp H E Australian motor-tyre industry is
1 now a scene of fierce competition,
emphasised as newcomer B. F. Goodrich
Australia Pty. (formed by the Inter-
national B. F. Goodrich Co., of U.S.A.,
and Ampol Petroleum, of Australia) gets
under way and as Hardie Rubber Co.,
Ltd., asserting new-found strength
(Hardie Rubber was taken-over by H. C.
Sleigh, Ltd., last December), bids for a
bigger slice of the market.
Tyre sales in Australia have increased
steadily in recent years, but at a rate
considerably below that necessary to
enable full utilisation of installed plant-
capacity. Even before Goodrich’s arrival
the Australian motor - tyre industry
operated at less than 90 p.c. maximum
capacity.
Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Co. (Aus-
tralia), Ltd., offshoot of the giant Good-
year Tyre and Rubber Co., Akron
(U.S.A.), felt the strain last term. Turn-
over is not disclosed —it may have been
maintained or improved—but net profit
dropped sharply, down £396,330 at

An increasingly bewildering system of
npubliascd preferential discounts to
omers (partially rectified now since
t t , easure . °f price-stability, applicable
fl,. Jj t / re mdustry as a whole, was intro-
ther u laSt a 40 p.c. increase, or
in , I ° uts ’ ln the price of raw rubber
has <Lt? C j nc ? the y ear (the price
a start Cd ?"?■ but . onl y slightly), and
took huild-up in labor costs, all
toll. The price of synthetic
rubber, which, in quantity, constitutes
50 p.c. of Goodyear’s basic rubber re-
quirements, also rose, but by a compara-
tively small amount.
Latest Goodyear result is ascertained
after- setting aside £408,750 (down
£192,456) for taxation, £691,274 (not
disclosed in the preceding year) for
depreciation, and £64,000 (nil in 1958)
for long - service leave contingency.
Allowing for prefs., it is equivalent to
28.2 p.c. of present ord. capital
(£1,700,000), or 38.3 p.c. on the
£1,250,000 ord. capital as it stood twelve
months before. This compares with 70
p.c., 35.7 p.c., 54.9 p.c. and 70.7 p.c.
back to 1955. Divs. involving £779,412
(62.4 p.c. on £1,250,000) were paid during
the year. They were immediately
reinvested in the co. as capital, after pay-
ment of div. tax. The ord. capital is held
exclusively by the U.S. parent. Pref.
capital, 300,000 20s. 8 p.c. cum. prefs.,
is held by the Australian public.
It was to avoid the tariff that the
co.—it stepped into a ready-made con-
nection built up by an importing sub-
sidiary—erected a factory at Granville
(N.S.W.), where production began early
in 1927. Goodyear has now completed
32 years of trading and has a pleasing
record of vigorous growth backed -up
by technical and financial know-how.
Divs. popping up, but at long intervals,
have been big and chunky, apart, of
course, from the regular pref. handout.
Distributions of 40 p.c. (£500,000) and
80 p.c. (£1,000,000) were made in 1953
and 1954. Last term’s div., the first in
five years, takes the average annual dis-
tribution—since the co.’s incorporation
—to 15.9 p.c., and a £250,000 bonus-issue
was made, as well, in 1934.
Reserves dropped a solid £300,608 last
term, but were still an awe-inspiring
£5,636,007.
Goodyear as it stands today, its vast
and towering ramifications, is largely the
product of ploughed - back profits
blossoming under fertile management.
Improvements, effected to plant, plus in-
creased mechanisation, at Granville
(N.S.W.), have facilitated greater effi-
ciency and larger and more streamlined
production—a £2-miliion expansion and
modernisation programme was concluded
at Granville in 1958. Although tyres and
tubes account for the bulk of the co.’s
output, diversification is increasingly
apparent, the product range spreading
now to a variety of tyre-repair and re-
tread materials, batteries and accessories,
industrial hose and conveyor-, electric-
and transmission-belting.
Expansion continues, too, inter-State.
New branches were opened in Vic. and
W.A. last term. A nation-wide sales-
organisation—under the auspices of the
subsidiary Motor Tyre Service Pty.—is
entrenched throughout the Common-
wealth.
The most recent and perhaps the most
spectacular development of latter years
is the acquisition of a substantial interest
in the Australian Synthetic Rubber Co.,
Ltd., a Vacuum Oil subsidiary, which is
to build a £5-million synthetic-rubber
plant, near Altona, Vic. The rubber
plant is part of a huge £23-million petro-
chemical synthetic - rubber complex
announced by Vacuum in January, 1959.
Construction of the mammoth enterprise
should be well under way by the end of
the year.
The impact of increased activity and
more difficult conditions is reflected in
the balance-sheet:

The book-value of buildings, machinery
and equipment rose, in all, £520,374 to
£8,146,884, but, after allowing deprecia-
tion thereon (the total accumulated pro-
vision, £5,226,365, was up £605,616) a
net-drop of £85,242 (to £2,920,519)
showed -up in the final figures. The
liability to debenture-holders (4| p.c.
mortgage-debentures maturing 1955-70)
was reduced by £105,000 to £1,975,000.
Goodyear actively pursues expansion
of distribution network both through
co.-owned and independent outlets. But
with competition gathering force, price-
wise and service-wise, it is difficult to
forecast any bettering of last term’s per-
formance in the current year.
Meantime, at 265. 6d., the £1 prefs.
give a guaranteed return of 6 p.c. Net
tangible cover (book-values) is £25 9s. Id.
John A. Gilbert Holdings, Ltd.
on the crest of the Holden’s
popularity, John A. Gilbert Hold-
ings, Ltd., had a profitable year. Net
earnings increased by more than 35 p.c.
by comparison with the previous term,
and shareholders collected another useful
15 p.c. dividend-cheque. A continued
high demand for Holden vehicles, the
undisputed leaders of the Australian
motor-car market, seems to ensure a
bright future for the investors.
Incorporated in N.S.W. in 1951 as
Consolidated Automotive Industries,
Ltd., the co. altered its name to present
style when it joined the public list in
1954.

Branches at Grafton and Armidale
distributor, the group now comprises
seven subsidiary private cos. controlled
from the head-office in Sydney’s busy
William Street.
In addition to distributing Holden
vehicles, the group is engaged in diversi-
fied activities which supplement earnings
and spread investment risks. 's
Through the subsidiary Bus Lines of
Australia Pty. the co. operates omnibus-
lines in N.S.W. country areas.
Credit and Guarantee Pty. is the
organisation’s hire-purchase financier. In-
dustrial Lessors Pty. is a small subsidiary
handling vehicle-leasing.
Last term John A. Gilbert (Whole-
sale) Pty. was formed as a service-unit
within the group. The bulk of the busi-
ness is handled by the Holden-distribut-
ing John A. Gilbert Pty. and John A.
Gilbert (Northside) Pty.
The group had a good year. The 1960
model of the Holden was favorably re-
ceived by consumers. Production of
Holden vehicles is increasing steadily.
The market easily absorbs available
supplies.
The monthly average of registrations
of all motor-vehicles (except motor-
bikes) in N.S.W. for 1959 was 959 higher
at 8468. In the first six months of 1960,
143,259 motor-vehicles (up 24,989) were
registered in Australia and Holdens
accounted for 32.7 p.c. of all cars and
72.7 p.c. of all station-wagons.
The absolute number of sales increased
substantially, although their proportion
of total market edged-down under the
impact of intensifying competition,
spurred-on by the recent easing of import
restrictions.
During last term John A. Gilbert Pty.
and John A. Gilbert (Northside) Pty.
together sold 5856 new and used cars,
trucks and omnibuses, compared with
3978 in the previous year. A noticeable
feature of motor-vehicle sales is the in-
creasing popularity of Holden * station-
wagons.
Sales of replacement-parts and acces-
sories “were maintained and continued
to contribute to profits.”
Bus Lines of Australia Pty. showed a
slightly increased profit. The volume of
new business accepted last term by Credit
and Guarantee Pty. “showed improve-
ment and profit was substantially higher.”
This year it is proposed to extend h.-p.
activities beyond the financing of sales
of new and used motor-vehicles.
Industrial Lessors Pty. “continued in a
moderate way the business of leasing
vehicles, and a satisfactory profit
resulted.”
All in all, consolidated net trading
profit for the year ended March 31,
1960, was £79,753 higher at £294,651,
after providing £37,208 (up £547) for
depreciation.
Tax-provision was £32,217 higher at
£111,902, leaving consolidated net profit
£47,536 fatter at £182,749:

After satisfying the unchanged pref.-div.

to an earning-rate of 35.3 p.c. on the
average ord. capital, compared with 25.9
p.c. in the preceding term, 24.6 p.c. in
1958 and 26 p.c. in 1957.
For the sixth consecutive year share-
holders received a handsome 15 p.c.,
absorbing £76,257. Reserves received
£102,492, and were disclosed at £418,358,
subject to £101,351 intangibles.
More funds were employed. Last
October the co. issued £101,144 ss. 6 p.c.
convertible notes, one-for-five. The notes
have a currency of five years and will be
convertible into ords. at par.
Short-term loan-capital was increased
by £175,000 deposits at call, but £213,215
bank- accommodation disappeared.
Debtors were higher. H.-p. outstandings
increased by £176,763 to £686,316. Stock

The subsidiary, Consolidated
Insurances Pty., “continues to
progress.” A div. was received
by the parent for the year ended
June 30, 1959.
Interest, divs. and rents
yielded a net return of £78,995
(up £12,897).
Management costs (including
“provision for taxation and

As a general rule the board
looks to income from invest-

underwritings to augment
accumulated reserves. This is
intended to cushion the effect

Draffin Everhot, Ltd.
TAivs. have been steady
at 10 p.c. since Draffin
Everhot’s inception, capital
has more than doubled —the
co. made a one-for-four par-
issue in 1953, a one-for-three
par-issue in 1954 and a one-
for - four bonus - issue last
December—and the 10s. ords.
fetch 235. on today’s market,
yielding 4.4 p.c.
Sallying forth to the public
lists in December, 1950, the
stripling newcomer Draffin
Everhot, Ltd., exchanged
110,000 10s. ords. and £5OOO
in cash for the share-capital
of Draffin Bros. Pty., offering,
at the same time, 70,000 ords..
at par to the public—was early
called on to assert its capa-
bilities and resourcefulness.
Shortly after flotation, Vic-
toria introduced regulations
restricting sale of electric hot-
water systems (at the time, the
co.’s main product) throughout
the State. Draffin set-to to
diversify production and
develop inter-State markets.
This it has done successfully.
Today the co. turns-out
electric-, kerosene-, gas- and
oil-burning hot-water systems,
sink-heaters, low-level flushing
cisterns and slow-combustion
cooking - ranges. The non-
electric lines have opened-up
hitherto untapped markets in
rural areas.
Costs continued to rise last
term. But so, too, did turn-
ove r. A cost - conscious
management kept expenses in
check. Prices were not
increased during the term.
Net profit, though failing to
parallel more buoyant sales,
rose to £43,671 (up £1444),
after draining-off £27,552 (up
£3811) for depreciation and an
unchanged £30,000 for tax:

March 31, 1960.
The net figure was equal to
an earning-rate of 23.3 p.c.
(29.1 p.c. on pre-bonus capital),
against 28.1 p.c., 30.4 p.c.,
31.6 p.c. and 23 p.c. back to
1956. The div. handout took
an extra £3750. Reserves, sub-
ject to intangibles, £82,041,
and augmented by £3665 tax
overprovided in the preceding
term, jumped £27,159 to
£240,543.
The overprovision for tax
is interesting in that the cur-
rent liability as disclosed is
appropriate to a net profit of
around £50,000. This suggests
either a profit higher than
that revealed in the latest
accounts or that, once again,
tax has been provided for on
a more liberal scale than
necessary.
With a new factory not long
in operation (at Fishermen’s
Bend, Vic.), with an ever-
widening range of products,
some already on the market
and others on the way, and
with inter-State markets look-
ing-up—the co. now operates
a warehouse and showroom

(N.S.W.) —Draffin Everhot is
looking to the market for
further funds. A £75,000, 10s.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, august 1, 1960.
rr HE best thing about Mr.
1 Nordmeyer’s Budget is that
it m akes no major election
handouts.
Reductions in duty of 2d. a
dlon on petrol and a penny
on a packet of 20 cigarettes are
the main concessions.
eaies-tax on motor-vehicles
is cut from 40 per cent, to 33 j
per cent.
Income-tax rates remain un-
changed, but aggregation of the
incomes of married couples is
abolished, except where one
derives income from assets
owned by the other, or settled
under a trust.
The amount of interest from
Post Office and trustee savings-
bank accounts, national savings
and Government stock ex-
empted from income-tax is in-
creased from £l2 to £3O.
Exemption for life-assurance
and superannuation contribu-
tions is raised to £250, or 20
per cent, of assessable income.
Estate-duty is unchanged,
but the timber value of trees
on farms is to be exempt and
money given to the Govern-
ment as prepayment of duty
will not be deemed part of the
estate. Further relief is also
given in cases of deaths in quick
succession.
Minor adjustments are made
in Social Security benefits and
war pensions, including an
easing of the means-test.
Persons travelling overseas
bn pleasure trips will be allowed
to take a maximum of £1250
in funds. The limit was for-
merly £750. Only travellers who
nave not received an allocation
for pleasure-travel in the past
three years will qualify for the
increased sum.
pEATUREs of the Budget of
special interest to com-
panies and investors include
the following:
Control over issues of
ordinary share-capital, to be
raised in New Zealand by New
caland companies, is removed,
except in the field of hire-pur-
ohase and credit sales.
Control over issues of pre-
sence shares, debentures and
convertible notes is removed
where the rate of interest does
not exceed 5| p.c.
Control over issues of first
mortgages is removed where
the rate of interest does not
exceed 5| p.c.
The committee’s specific con-
sent will still be needed: where
proposed Interest rates exceed
those stipulated ; for overseas
companies wishing to begin
business in New Zealand ; for
any issue of capital in excess
of £lO,OOO which is to be used
for financing or discounting
hire-purchase or credit-sale
agreements.
Maximum interest payable
on deposits with building-
societies, investment societies
and trading companies is fixed
at rates ranging from 2 p.c. for
deposits at call to 5 p.c. for
deposits repayable in seven
years.
Any advertisement inviting
subscriptions for deposits is to
be deemed to be a prospectus
under the Companies Act.
Trading- banks will be
authorised to advance money
for agricultural, industrial and
commercial equipment by way
of hire-purchase or term loans
of up to three years.
The maximum rate of in-
terest for local-body loans not
already authorised is reduced
from 5 p.c. to 4| p.c.—that is,
i p.c. above the Government’s
own borrowing-rate.
The proportion of' a loan
which a local body may issue
for a term of six years or less
is reduced from one-third to
one-fifth of the issue.
The Government will raise
another internal loan later in
the financial year and will also
raise a small external loan if
market conditions are favor-
able. The amount of the ex-
ternal loan will depend on the
support given the local loan.
The Government will issue
development bonds, income
from which will carry a tax-
concession.
Excess retention-tax will not
be payable by companies if
the Commissioner of Inland
Revenue is satisfied that the in-
come retained is required for
necessary development or ex-
pansion involving the acquisi-
tion of buildings, plant or other
productive equipment.
A special depreciation allow-
ance of 20 per cent., spread
over five years, will be made
for all plant and machinery
(excluding motor-cars and
buildings) acquired between
April 1, 1960 and March 30,
1963, inclusive.
The capital- works pro-
gramme for 1960-61 will re-
quire £96.5 million £11.5
million more than last year.
Tmport-licensing restrictions
would be relaxed as and
when trends in export prices
and in external reserves in-
dicated such a course would be
possible, Mr. Nordmeyer said.
If export prices were main-
tained and the outlook for
wool was favorable some
further relaxation of import-
licensing might be possible
when announcing the import-
licensing schedule for 1961.
Remittances for private im-
ports totalled £217 million in
the year ended March 31, 1960,
compared with £227 million the
previous year.
'T'hf. first major alterations to
A the tariff since it was in-
troduced in 1934 were made by
resolution of the House. The
changes are designed mainly to
give increased protection to in-
dustries manufacturing con-
sumer-goods in N.Z.
The Minister of Customs,
Mr. 800 r d, said provision
would be made in greater detail
for the products of the rubber
industry. Provision would be
made for the products of the
plastics industry which hitherto
had not been mentioned in
the tariff. The electrical goods
section would be extended to
provide protection for the vast
field of electrical production
which had developed since
1934.
The existing policy of charg-
ing higher duty on goods im-
ported in retail packages than
on the same goods in bulk
would apply to a further class
of goods.
VX/Tra an average price for the
season of 44.65 d. per lb.
the N.Z. wool cheque for the
season just ended is £76,120,820,
or £l5 million more than it
was for the 1958-59 season,
according to figures quoted by
the New Zealand Wool Board.
The average price a bale this
season was £62 9s. Id., com-
pared with £5O 17s. sd. last
season.
The number of bales sold
totalled 1,218,794, as against

GLOVES
FOR
HIRE
By
PETER WARD
Dave Flannigan rode his
motor-bike 300 miles
down the track from
Darwin to the mining-
town of Gibber Flat, spat out
dust and told himself firmly,
“Keep your knuckles clean
this time, Davey boy, because
the job’s got to last.”
He wanted it to last longer
than the Darwin job, which
had lasted three days, or the
week at Broome, or the 10 days
at Hall’s Creek. Then there
was the Mount Isa job.
It was unfortunate about the
Mount Isa job because he had
intended to make a lot of
money there, but he had
thought that the big German
was deliberately crowding him
in the cage going down the
shaft. When the cage reached
the work-level the big German
had a split lip and Dave was
unemployed.
However, the employment
officer at Gibber Flat didn't
press him for details about his
previous jobs. He merely
recorded the last three places
where Dave had worked and
told him to report for the eight-
o’clock shift in the morning.
Dave went to the company
store and signed for a horse-
hair mattress, then followed the
storeman’s truck down to the
barracks block.
'T'hey pulled-up alongside a
A veranda in the dusty com-
pound formed by four long
corrugated-iron buildings. The
storeman took the mattress
from the back of the truck and
put it on the veranda outside
one of the doors.
“You’ll have to bunk in here
with Laurie Melling,” he apolo-
gised to Dave. “We’ve got
nowhere else to put you at the
moment.”
“I don’t mind where you put
me, mate,” Dave assured him
cheerfully. “Put me under the
water tank if you like.” Then,
as an afterthought, “What’s
wrong with this bloke Laurie
Melling?”
“Nothing wrong with him.
Nothing wrong with him at
all,” the storeman said quickly.
There was a pause while he
thought of something else to
add. He laughed. “Laurie’s
all right. Just likes a room to
himself, that’s all. But we’re
full-up now, 50... But Laurie’s
all right,” he said vaguely,
looking .away from Dave.
“Hell, yes!”
The storeman cautiously
opened the door and glanced
inside.
“Yes,” he said softly, “he’s
asleep. Thought he would be.
He’s been on night-shift this
week. Go quietly when you
go in. Laurie doesn’t like to
be woke up. You’ll find your
bed in there, and a locker for
your things.”
Dave looked through the
doorway and saw a heavy
punching-bag suspended from
the centre rafter.
“What’s that for?”
“Oh, that? That’s Laurie’s
punching bag. He practises on
that.”
“Practises? What’s he prac-
tise for?”
“Well, that’s his hobby, more
or less. Boxing. He keeps
himself in trim with the bag.
Do you go in for it at all?”
“Only when I have to,
friend. Only when I have to.”
The storeman looked at him
closely. “Anyway, you’d be a
bit light for Laurie. You
wouldn’t go eleven stone, would
you?”
“About that.”
“Thought so. Laurie’s about
sixteen, and solid.”
“Pretty handy, is he?” Dave
asked casually.
“Very handy with the mitts.
I’ll say! But he’s all right as
long as you don’t upset him.
Anyway, you’ll only be in with
him for a week. A bloke’s
leaving next week. Across there
in D-block, he is. You can
move in there when he goes.
I’ll tell Laurie.”
Dave shrugged. “Yeah, tell
him. What’s the beer like
here?”
“Pretty good. Don’t drink
too much at once. It’ll knock
you all of a sudden. Anyway,
I’ll have to be getting back
to the store.”
The storeman got into his
truck and roared out of the
compound in a haze of dust.
Dave carried the mattress
into the room and looked
around.
nPHE furniture was two iron
beds, two wooden lockers,
a table and two chairs. And the
punching-bag.
The bed nearest the door was
occupied by Laurie Melling,
sprawled in sleep on his bad
one hairy arm reaching to tk
floor, the thick fingers curled in
repose. He was snoring, tk
rumbling sonority coming from
deep within his huge chest,
He was big, all right, and be

The other bed was littered
with pulp novels, magazines
and comic books.

Maryvale Mill, in Victoria’s rich Latrobe
Valley, is a key unit in the nation-wide opera-
tions of Australian Paper Manufacturers
Limited and Australia’s only kraft pulp and
paper mill.
It was believed that no satisfactory paper-
making pulp could be produced from Australia’s
native timbers but following pulping experi-
ments commenced in 1920, C.5.1.R.0. and
A.P.M. pioneered a process to manufacture
pulp from Eucalypts.
A pilot mill began producing at Maryvale in
December, 1937, at the rate of some 17 tons
a day. Today about 300 tons of kraft pulp
are produced daily.
To meet the rapidly growing demands of
A.P.M. for pulp-wood and to supplement
supplies available from State forests a subsidiary
company A.P.M. Forests Pty. Ltd. was
formed in 1951, charged with establishing and
maintaining eucalypt and pine forests.
A.P.M. Forests must look far into the future
to plan for an ever-increasing demand.
Every year millions of seedlings grown in
nurseries are planted, and, by sound harvesting
in State and A.P.M. forests, the company is
making sure that many more healthy seedlings
will establish themselves naturally.
Forestry development has now extended to
Queensland where new tree farms are being
established and maintained to supply A.P.M.’i
new Petrie Mill.

Fishing with Lolo
After the Big Ones
By CHARLES MacGREGOR
Lolo the fisherman was
very angry. He had
been up to Neiafu in
the popping motor-boat
Kerosene Can with Tobias and
Sikaleti. Going and coming
he had trolled the self-striking
spoon-bait that I had given
him, using his precious
seventy - two thread “kati-
haniki” (cuttyhunk) line,, but
had not had a strike until they
were rounding the point to
run into FaleVai on the way
home.
Then there was a sudden
hard strike, and a big ono
shot-up several feet into the
air and sent the lure flying
skywards.
Tobias circled the barra-
cuda’s castle, the big coral
outcrop about ten-feet under
water, but it would not come
again. So Lolo thought he
would try drifting over the
spot in his canoe.
He was one of the few
Tongans that I ever saw using
a circular cast-net, but he was
quite expert at it, and
that afternoon he netted
a few golden mullet in
the lagoon, replaced his
lure with a large hook
and paddled off by him-
self in the borrowed
cgnoe.
It was not as con-
venient as his father’s
special long-line fishing
bobao, having only a
very narrow space between
gunwales, but he fixed a
couple of break-off pegs and
had his line in long coils
amidship.
I did not go with him, but
watched him through my
binoculars.
TJe had worked across and
around the rock several
times with the light hibiscus-
wood float moving slowly in
his wake. It suddenly disap-
peared and Lolo swung the
canoe, dropped his paddle
behind him and went into
action.
His break-off pegs had set
the hook, and I could see that
he was fast to a big fish. In
a few seconds I could see what
it was —an enormous barra-
cuda.
The big ono did all the
things that one might expect
of its kind. Either they were
more common among the
deep island channels than any
other game-fish, or they took
our lines more readily; but
this one that Lolo hooked
played one trick that I never
had seen before, and I would
not want it played on me.
After ten minutes or so of
futile sounding, straight run-
ning, arching and leaping,
gaining and losing the line, it
went quite berserk arid charged
the canoe, first from one side
and then the other, with long
hurdling leaps that Lolo
avoided time after time by
throwing himself forward as
it left the water.
I was much too far away
to hear or to see clearly, but
I could easily believe Lolo
when he told me afterwards
that he could hear the snap
of the big brute’s jaws as it
went over.
How he managed to keep
the line clear of the outrigger
logs and spars I can’t imagine,
but manage it he did.
The fish’s amazing acro-
batics were too strenuous to
last long, and in its final leap,
which missed Lolo by inches,
it fell heavily across the out-
rigger log, pushing it down
so that the canoe heeled
dangerously and nearly tipped
the bold fisherman overboard.
It must have hurt itself
badly, for after that nearly
all the fight had gone out
of it, and Lolo had little diffi-
culty in bringing it closer and
closer to the canoe. Then,
just as he was about to reach
for his harpoon, the line went
slack.
That great fish was gone—
bitten off cleanly behind the
head!
No wonder Lolo was angry.
Very angry!
I saw him haul in the line,
lift-up the enormous head,
hurl it into the bottom of the
canoe, grab his paddle and
set-off at full-speed for Fale-
Vai village. There he beached
the bobao and went running
up to Tobias’s trading-store.
I waited a quarter-of-an-
hour to see him reappear, and
then went up to the camp.
An hour later he came back
to Nuku, and dumped at
the landing-place a pair of
tapering bamboo poles, a coil
of sennit rope and a heavy
shark-line with a very large
hook.
He cut-out the hook from
the ono’s great head, which
he tossed ashore, and set about
winding-up his long line.
The ono’s mouth was like a
greyhound’s, with its long,
pointed teeth, and the head
measured sixteen-inches from
the point of the nose to where
it had been chopped off two-
inches behind the gills.
- I saw that Lolo was in no
mood for conversation, so I
took the great fish-head up
to the camp to show- the
womenfolk. Fefita and her
mate were greatly excited
about it —never had they seen
anything like that, and they
wanted to run down and ask
Lolo all about it.
“Tuku ai be!” (“Just leave
it!”) I advised them. “L 0 !o
is very angry, and I don’t think
he wants to talk just now,”
When I went back to the
water’s edge he had the bobao
up on the beach. He had cut
the lashings, dismantled the
outrigger, and was busy lash-
ing the tapering, flexible
bamboo poles in the places of
the outrigger spars.
“Excuse me,” he said. “1
very angry for shark—big
mako— taking Ono, when I
have him finish. I make him
sorry.”
He put very strong lashings
on the two poles; then turned
the canoe upside-down and
lashed the ends of the poles
direct to the outrigger-log
without the usual supports,
He cut several fairly straigh'j
beach-hibiscus poles and
lashed them to the bamboos
to form a light, narrow plat
form between the canoe and
the outrigger-log. He then
turned the whole contraption
upside-down and lashed i
much thicker spar of light
wood along the edge of ti*
platform.
“Koeha, Lolo? What is if
“I go to kill Mako. If I
go in bobao and hook him, he
pull it under. If Ig° 011
bobao and go far back whet
he go down he not able to
pull it under, so I make hi™
pull, pull, pull, till he is finish
Then I kill him.”
“How big is he, Lolo?”
“Not very big, about one-
fathom and half-fathom, W
Mako is very strong shark
“But you don’t mean to saj

’
T gAD seen the behavior of
1 one or two makos when
brought to gaff, and I certainly
never had what it takes to
move-up beside one with my
bare legs dangling from an
overturned canoe.
I tried to dissuade Lolo
from his foolhardly plan, but
he was sure he would be all
right with the platform sticks
to protect his legs, and his
mind was made-up to give it
j go.
I need not have worried.
It was too late that evening
to try-out his plan, but he
went off early the next morn-
ing, the big hook which he
had borrowed from Tobias
baited with three of the mullet
caught the previous day.
He took with him—as well
as line, spear, knife, club, all
secured with strong lanyards
-a three-foot circle of half-
inch creeper-stalk on which he
had strung several half-
coconut shells. I took my
binoculars and went down to
the point to watch.
When he got to the place
where he had lost his big
barracuda he lowered his line
till the big wooden float lay
on top of the water. Then
he backed-off a few yards and
picked-up his hoop of coco-
nut-shells.
Splashing and shaking it, so
that the shells rattled and
clashed, half-in, half-out of
the water, he began a native
call in a high yodelling sing-
song: “Ha’u anga . . . come,
shark, hurry to me. You
beautiful big Mako,' come and
feed by me. Good food for
you here . . . come quick and
eat it!” and so on, with all
the usual wheedling, coaxing
flattery.
Generally the shark-fishing
canoe holds at least three men
— one on b ow to dangle a
nice smelly bait from a short
rod with one hand, while he
splashes and rattles the hoop
of shells with the other. The
second man, the master of
ceremonies, amidships, to do
the talking ; and the third to
handle the paddles and keep
the canoe stern-on.
When the shark accepts the
invitation and makes a dash at
the dangling bait this is lifted
o ut Q f jt s re ach, as the man
amidships drops a looped
rope in front of the shark
an d jerks it tight. The steers-
man, dropping his paddle,
then picks-up his club and
crashes it down on the point
G f the nose and between the
eyes of the struggling shark,
They don’t always get away
w i t h it. In the Neiafu hos-
pital, a lad with a bandaged
foot explained casually: “We
were doing faka-Tonga fishing
in a canoe, shark-fishing, and
the small shark would not put
his head in the noose, so I
gave him a push with my
foot to make him go in. He
is very angry for me I push
him, so he turn quick and
bite my foot.”
With Lolo, it was a one-
man show, with the hook
instead of a noose, but his luck
was out —or was it?
TTe had shifted his position
several times, but there
was no sign of dorsal-fin or
notched sickle-tail.
He was having a spell from
his rattling and calling, when
suddenly the big float went
under.
He sat slightly aft of the
middle of the canoe as the line
ran out, and when the for-
ward outrigger-pole took the
strain and the bow began to
dip he moved further back.
Whatever he had hooked,
it was no mako, for the canoe
just moved slowly along at
about two knots. The fish,
or whatever it was, towed
the canoe about half-a-mile
up the channel, and then
turned and came back at the
same slow rate—about as
exciting as a tow-
along in a canal-
barge by a slow
draught-horse.
It was all of an
hour before there
was anything to
watch except the
slowly decelerat-
ing progress of
the canoe up and
down and round
about.
Finally it stopped alto-
gether, and Lolo worked his s
way forward and began to
take-in line, which he dropped
on the little platform as the
canoe moved onward. Then
-he moved back again alnd
began hauling with all his
strength.
Twice he had to stop for
a few seconds as the fish
bored downwards again, but
at last it came up quickly and
broke surface a few yards
ahead of the canoe.
Whatever monster could it
be? It looked like the back
of a huge turtle, but when
Lolo worked it round to the
free side of the canoe, took
out his knife and drove it in
up to the hilt, I knew it was
no turtle. He then worked it
round to the outrigger side,
tied it up close to the forward
outrigger-pole, and then took
the bight of the line and went
overboard.
A few seconds later he was
hauling in the bight, which he
made fast to the after-pole
and began his slow journey
back to the beach.
“Koe ha ?” I hailed him.
“What is it, Lolo?”
“Koe ngatala, ngatala lahi
aubito aubito !” (“The groper
—the very, very big groper!”)
“The people of FaleVai will
do no work till after to-
morrow.”
TTE brought it in till it
grounded in the shallow
water of the outgoing tide,
undid the lashings, reversed
the canoe, and went over to
FaleVai to get Sikaleti in the
motor-boat and a few men to
lift the big groper on board.
It was over six-feet long and
very wide and thick, mottled
grey and brown, with a mouth
that I could have put my head
and shoulders into.
It certainly was a whopper,

Immigration and its Impact
Last December, addressing the Com-
monwealth Club in Adelaide on
migration problems, Immigration
Minister Downer rejected the sug-
gestion that a quota for Asian migrants
would encourage friendship between
Asia and Australia. He reminded his
audience that the United States and
Canada had long had a quota-system
yet “despite their quotas, neither of these
countries is better liked in Asia than our
own.”
The Minister said we in Australia had
plenty of experience in other parts of the
world to guide us as to what could
happen if we adopted an indiscriminate,
multi-racial immigration policy.
In the same speech Mr. Downer
referred to the changing composition of
the flow of migrants to Australia. He
said it was our policy to attract “as many
of our kinsfolk from the United Kingdom
as possible” and he did not think there
was any serious argument here about
that. But,
the task lies not in convincing public
opinion here, but in making political and
commercial leaders in England realise that
the ultimate interests of the British
Commonwealth will best b'e served by a
deliberate policy of dispersion of popula-
tion from the Mother-country to her proven
friends, Australia and New Zealand. Nor
is there any serious dispute as to the
necessity for migrants from Europe....
In delivering the Milne Memorial
Lecture to the Australian Institute of
International Affairs in Sydney on July
28 Mr. Downer took as his subject “The
Influence of Migration on Australian
Foreign Policy.” In this he reiterated the
two points he had touched-on in the
earlier address. He said that today it
was fashionable to speak of Australia as
part of Asia, but to do so was to confuse
a state of being with an object of policy.
Except for a fractional percentage,
Australia’s population was European in
racial origin, religion and ideas. Part of
Australia’s destiny might well be with
Asia, but the essence of it would be that
of “a rather novel interpreter of Anglo-
European ideas, institutions and a manner
of life, and likewise in reverse, between
Asia and Europe.”
Asking whether such a role would be
advanced by changing our traditional
immigration policy in favor of an
admixture of Asian and European peoples
within Australia, he continued:
I think the disadvantages would out-
weigh whatever good might flow- from
such a revolutionary change of attitude.
The experience of countries where racial
intermixtures have been tried is not
encouraging... .Indeed, on the basis of
other nations’ experience and from my
knowledge of the temperament of our own
people, there is a strong possibility that
an inflow of Asians would defeat the very
object of our foreign policy towards our
Asian friends... .Instead of relieving mis-
understanding it would provoke tensions.
It would create social problems which
fortunately we have hitherto escaped....
The growing interest and understanding of
our Asian neighbors might well become
stunted by intolerance and bitterness.
T ~ .
In his Milne lecture the Minister
referred agam to the changing balance
between British and European migrants.
But whereas last December he still seemed
hopeful of increasing the British propor-
tion, he now doubts whether the present
intake of 65,000 a year (including return-
ing Australians) can be exceeded. The
British Government sees no virtue in the
idea of dispersing its population through-
out the Commonwealth. This fact Mr.
Downer reluctantly accepts, and he warns
that the Australian people must accept
it, too, and with it the implications that
follow from a migrant intake drawn in-
creasingly from Continental Europe.
he is concerned with the effect
of a large non-British European ele-
ment bn Australian political attitudes—in
particular its effect (1) on Australia’s
“Ten fathoms, sir—and a rocky bottom !”
awakened political consciousness of
Asia; (2) on preserving and possibly
increasing Australia’s concern with Euro-
pean affairs ; (3) on Australian thinking
about Britain and the Commonwealth ;
(4) on Australian ties with the United
States.
His conclusion is that European
migrants will be less aware than the
native-born of “Asia’s proximity and
problems”; also that in the future there
will be “a diminution of this country’s
traditional affection for the United King-
dom” and a greater tendency to look to
the United States.
However, he points out that people of
British descent still comprise between 85
and 90 per cent, of the population, and
“we must make it our business to
acquaint our European residents with our
point of view.” By this he presumably
means that if we don’t wapt our pre-
dominantly British habits and traditions
swamped we must make non-British
migrants more aware of them.
It is certainly essential to the nr.
A , .. proper
assimilation of New Australians that .n
Australians should take-over where tk

T . , 11S C ,° un T, s n ° w their home,
1S as ° indisputable that people who
c °* Tle to this country (or to any country)
when past their youth find it hard, if not
impossible, to change their views and
outlook to any vital degree. A large pro-
portion of European migrants will always
look back with nostalgia to their country
of origin. But provided we don’t encour-
age the growth of “Little Italys” or
“Little Polands” this should not apply
to their children, born here or educated
here from an early age. Like the rest of
us, these children will be educated under
a schooling system based on British
models and will share our inheritance of
a British culture, a British-based system
of laws and British forms of constitu-
tional government.
In talking of European culture, there
is too much tendency to think in terras
of Lithuanian and Hungarian folk-dances,
or Dutch clogs and baggy pants, although
these have as little to do with everyday
life in Europe as tossing the caber
in Scotland or maypole-dancing in EnS"
land. In music, art and even literature
Britain and Europe share a common cul-
tural heritage which numbers Austral
among its heirs. ~
The European admixture will n°
result in some modification of the A®
tralian type, but this need not necessa , r J
mean any great change in Austra
thinking. The Australian environm
will at the same time be working on
Europeans and their children in the sa
way that it worked on several gene/ 21
of our English, Scottish and Iris’ l
bears, modifying them into a more or
homogeneous type that most of us
satisfied to call Australian.

tests, while Hydrell finished
second to Young Gallant with-
out being pushed-out.
Prince Darius has won 11
races, including, the Chelms-
ford Stakes (twice), the Craven
Plate (twice), the Colin Stephen
Stakes and the Caulfield St.
George Stakes, all at w.f.a., but
no win has come his way since
October, 1958, and, though he
looked bright enough on his
return to racing in the Wall-
grove Handicap at Warwick
farm, he was last to the
Haight, and beat only three
home, several lengths from his
winning stablemate, Ramazan.
It should be said, however,
that Prince Darius was never
partial to the kind of soft
S°tog they had on Saturday.
Owners D. M.' and H. D.
e ‘ an d F- B. Dun brought off
an unusual double on Satur-
day when their Golden Hackle
gelding Radius landed the
Warwick Farm First Encour-
age and about 20 minutes later
their aged jumper Sundial
by the same sire—got home
in the Australian Hurdle
at Caulfield. Long odds were
on offer against Radius, whose
win demonstrated once more
that a middle-distance galloper
will often go extra-well in a
sprint at first start after a
spell.
When, a week or two back,
the filly Vistrabou easily won
a Maiden Two-year-old at
Hawkesbury what the crowd
heard from the race broad-
caster was the somewhat
unusual announcement “Either
this filly really is good or the
others aren’t worth a
crumpet!” He was certainly
right on the first count. Hav-
ing her next start at Saturday’s
Warwick Farm meeting she
trounced a better field in a
Novice Three-year-old just as
convincingly. She’s by Port
Vista (imp.) from Narmosley,
and her pedigree suggests stay-
ing possibilities, her dam being
by Marabou, winner of the
1935 Melbourne Cup, with
other notable stayers in the
background.

These days a Randwick
trainer, Darby Munro is hav-
ing a good run with his team
just now. At the Monday
Bank Holiday meeting at
Randwick he won the main
event with El Rocco, and on
Saturday at the Farm Prince
Wilkes, who carries Mrs.
Mu n r o’s colors, started
favorite and won the Novice
Three-year-old for colts and
geldings. A winner at Rand-
wick last February, the colt
was bred at Newhaven Park
Stud, Boorowa (N.S.W.), and
is by the French sire Wilkes
from Genoese (a winner in
Melbourne) by Dhoti (imp.)
from Genoa (V.R.C. Ottawa
Stakes) by Baralong (imp.).
Genoese is a half-sister to the
1942 Melbourne Cup winner
Colonus.

One genuine mud-runner
suited by the Warwick Farm
conditions was Edspell, who
duly added the Northmead
Handicap to his list, to make
his record four of his last five
wins on heavy tracks.
• • • •
To win practically all the
way over 11 furlongs on a
rain-soaked track is no mean
effort in any sort of company,
and four-year-old mare Trial
Sun did it very well at the
Farm. She was well ridden,
too, by apprentice H. Cope,
another of the whole team of
very promising young lads
now riding in tiptop style on
Sydney tracks. Trained by
A. H. Reynolds, Trial Sun is
by Sun Storm (imp.) from
Third Trial by Law Maker
(imp.) from Trinity by Man-
fred, and is related to Trivalve,
dual-Derby and Melbourne
Cup winner.
* * *
Fairly named Young Clancy
—a colt by Near Way (imp.)
from Overflow —easily won
last Saturday’s First Maiden
at Doomben. Overflow is by
Sirius (1944 Melbourne Cup
winner) from Buoyant by
Blank (imp.), tracing back to
Trenton, and family - lines
include Windbag, Poseidon and
Evening Peal —a fair sort of
trio.
* * *
At Caulfield
It is rare indeed for a horse
to win an important race as
easily as Sundial won last
Saturday’s Australian Hurdle
at Caulfield. After the field
got over the first jump Peter
Riley let Sundial stride to the
front. In quick time he was
20 or more lengths to the good,
and at the end of the two
miles, five furlongs and 65yds.

Riley had a tight hold on him
as he coasted home 15 lengths
ahead of Fair Counsel, with
Kerguelen third. Trained by
Fred Hoysted, Sundial will now

as a steeplechaser.

Far and away the best
steeplechaser racing in Mel-
bourne at present is the beauti-
fully-bred aged gelding Tran-
quil Glow, who’s by Helios
(imp.) from Tranquil Star. On
Saturday the chestnut carried
11.13 to effortless victory in
the Godfrey Watson Steeple-
chase—and the winner and
runner-up in this year’s Grand
National (Blacksmith and
Mudeet) were in the field. Also,
Tranquil Glow seemed to have
the National won when he fell
seven furlongs from home.
Worth noting, too, that for the
Slx years the winner of
the Godfrey Watson has gone
on to the Australian
Steeple.
....
Horse and rider need to be
fit to win the Australian
Steeplechase—at 31 miles it is
Australia’s longest race. Brian
Smith —now much better after
his crippling injury, but never
to ride again—won this race
five times during the 1950’5.
Back in 1892 Redleap, owned
by Septimus Miller, then chair-
man of the V.R.C., won the
Australian Steeple with the
prodigious weight of 13.12.
What a jumper he must have
been! In the same year he
won the Grand National
Hurdle with'll.l2, and the
Grand National Steepler
with 13.3. p ctlase
Tranquil Glow may w j n n . Tf
Saturday’s Australian Steen
chase, with Mudeet and Rli
smith the dangers.
Geoff Lane, who heade
Melbourne jockeys last season
went to an immediate W
when he won the first race
the new season—the first hea
of the Elsternwick Stake
(seven furlongs ; three-year-olc
fillies), won in a good perform
ance by Lady Sybil, who
carried 9.3 and started from th
outside barrier. Lane helped
lot. He got her away smartly
soon had her in front, am
thereafter she always lookec
the winner.
By Count Rendered from
Cassiopeia, Lady Sybil looks as i
she could win over a bit of grown
against her own sex. She’s trainer
by Ballarat mentor Arthur Smer-
don for C. H. Buchanan and his
wife. Buchanan raced the good
mare Scenic Star.
The second division of the
Elsternwick went to Misty
View, owned by Mrs. C. A,
Newton, who last year won the
same race with Carbonella,
Misty View had won at the
Valley at her previous start, and
she always had Saturday’s nee
in hand. She’s by Smokey
Eyes (imp.) from Wilma Joy by
El Golea from Bower by Caith-
ness (imp.).

“Geekay,” writing from Kal-
goorlie:—
When the Palace Hotel in the
then up-and-coming town of Kal-
goorlie was built and opened (in
1857) the motto adopted by the
first licensee (Rosenthal) was
“Nothing But The Best” ; everything
had to be “just so.”
And that’s how it was with the
billiards-saloon and its two tables
upstairs. The approach was by
fi of a staircase from Hannan
street, and to look after this
toon of the hotel’s activities they
brought in Fred Lindrum, who,
r. e ®. father and grandfather
Wore him, had achieved some
,f and s, ranking with the
, es ' , With Fred came a young
a : aLs ? ,^ re(^ — w ho later became
topnotcher and champion.
When Rosenthal gave-up the
Palace it was taken-over by Wallace
Brownlow previously at the
Exchange hostelry across the street
—and he was very friendly with
the Lindrum family. At the birth
of another son to Mr. and Mrs.
Lindrum—on August 29, 1898 —
Brownlow waxed all excitement as
to the name that should be
bestowed on the child.
“You must call him something
that will show he is a West
Australian!” he insisted.
And so Walter A. he was duly
named ... As here indicated, he
was just a shade under 62 at his
recent death, on July 30, on the
Queensland Gold Coast.
* * *
“G. Elburg”: When on tour
with McConachie, the New Zealand
champion, Walter Lindrum gave an
exhibition in the Perth Club. Our
best player gave him a safety miss,
and then sat down to watch the
finest conceivable display of all-
round billiards in a break of 997
(a difficult off-the-red shot was
just missed). Every shot in the
book was made on a table on
which the champion had never
played before.
After billiards there was a lively
game of snooker. The pink was
about a third of the way down
the table; Walter’s ball a foot from
the cushion at an angle of about
25° from the object-ball. As he
was shaping for the shot a club
member behind him called “You
won’t pot this one!” Walter
turned head and shoulders to face
the interjector with a smile —and,
still in that position, made his
shot! Down went the pink in
the bottom pocket without touching
the cushion.
* * *
“Furban”: Former Austra-
lian middleweight champion
Merv Williams, now scribe for
Melbourne “Sporting Globe,”
would be tickled to know that
his old school licked both
Terrace and Nudgee in the
final Rugby Union games of
this season. Merv often
crashed through on the left
wing for Ipswich Grammar,
the glamor side of the first
official G.P.S. (Q.) year of
1918. “Johnny” Hunt, who
worked the scrum and did the
same for the Queensland Rugby
League sides which carried all
before them in the 1920’5, is
now a master of Brisbane
State High, where he passes on
the wrinkles as a coach. Still
on deck, also, are Dr. Foote—
member of the well-known
Ipswich family—and solicitor
Hooper, who looks after the
farmers of the potato and
pumpkin valley of Laidley.

Well out in front in Sydney’s
Rugby Union comp., Northern
Suburbs took a surprise lacing from
Randwick in Saturday’s round,
9-6; University belted Drummoyne,
13-3; Gordon beat Eastern

Eastwood, 15-6; and St. George
beat Manly, 8-3.

“Rugger”: The buzz around
Rugby Union headquarters is
that a big manufacturing out-
fit is going to help Rugby on
a nation-wide basis next year.
It has already been nattering
with Union heads on plans to
promote a national junior
tournament, to be staged in
each State, with the final in
Sydney. It’s a big scheme.
The firm has come into the field
following a close examination,
of the growth made by Union
throughout Australia in the last
few years. Today there’s hardly
a worth-while town where you
can’t get a game if you happen
to be passing through.
* * *
A cold, wet weekend fell on the
last round of the Sydney Rugby
League competition, but it didn’t
stop young St. George centre Reg
Gasnier from displaying his World
class, going over for three splendid
tries in his team’s 13-9 defeat of
Balmain. Gasnier’s ability is now
apparently taken for granted —his
tries, the result of brains, speed
and footwork, hardly raised a
cheer! Wests, in a very scrappy
game, beat Souths, 22-7; Canter-
bury, 17, were too good for New-
town, 10; Manly, 7, playing a
man short from the first half, were
knocked out of the semis by
Norths, 10; and at the Sports
Ground on Sunday Easts, 20, beat
Parramatta, 8.

“Yank”: Tennis p.-r.-o. Jim
Russell is tipping the U.S. to
give Australia a tough time
in the Davis Cup Challenge
Round in Sydney next Decem-
ber. Russell, seeing them re-
cently in action in the U.K.,
likes the all-round improve-
ment in giant Barry Mackay,
and the power and solid
stroking of Earl Bucholz. He
also says that Bill Talbert
reckons he has a winning
doubles pair at last —Bucholz
and Chuck McKinley. The
Yanks are expected to bring
Ron Holmberg to Australia
as well, now that he has
graduated and has moved into
the tennis grind. He’s another
of the aggressive, non-stop
type, aged 22, and in good
condition.

As the season closes-in they’re
really packing them into the V.F.L.
arenas. No fewer than 81,000-
odd were at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground to see Melbourne down
Collingwood, 16.15-9.11, the
Demons getting loose in a grand
last-quarter burst to pile on five
goals in less than twice as many
minutes. The big roll-up broke
by more than 20,000 the
record for any comparable V.F.L.
match. In the other clashes, Essen-
don trounced Footscray, 14.11-8.10;
Fitzroy beat Richmond, 13.13-10.11;
Geelong beat St. Kilda, 13.9-9.16;
Hawthorn beat Carlton, 13.10-9.7;
and Norths walloped Souths,
14.16-9.20.

Visitors from all parts of
Australia are expected in
Gippsland for Victoria’s first
bi g fishing - competition, a t
Lakes Entrance, August 31 to
September 4. It is being spon-
sored by Ampol, and the organisers
mean to make it a topnotcher,
with, in addition to the five-days’
fishing, a carnival of dancing,
barbecues, fun-fairs, lifesaving
and boat-handling exhibitions and
many more attractions, including
a cycle-race from Sale to Lakes
Entrance for a special Ampol
trophy. One of the organisers—
Gippsland Lakes and Alpine
Tourist Council president G. Cole
—states that local councils,
angling - clubs, progress- and
tourist-associations and many
other organisations are co-operat-
ing on the planning-committee.
Proceeds from entry-fees and sale
of fish will go to Legacy, Carry
On Club and Gippsland Benevolent
Home. Highlight of the fishing
will be a tagged-fish contest with
cash prizes worth more than
£lO,OOO, and the handout for
other sections will bring the total
value of prizes to approximately
double that.

C. Brown sees some in
action:
With Dupas, rated fourth
welter in the world, at 10.6|, and
Scott, rated fifth, at 10.6, one could
expect an even battle when they
met at Sydney Stadium last week.
Both were fit and up to the mark,
both, of course, were confident,
and both had their supporters.
Those who had not seen Dupas
before were probably justified in
muttering about ballet-dancers in
the first round. Apart from one
brief exchange, footwork was the
only attraction. Throughout the
fight Dupas proved hard to catch,
as he skipped around the ring in
true Astaire fashion, and hard to
hit when Scott did catch up with
him. But no matter how good the
footwork, fight customers get
understandably peeved when it is
not mixed with fistwork.
The second round saw a change
in tempo, and this and the third
round were the most spirited of
the bout, with some really good
exchanges that brought roars from
the crowd. Dupas turned it on
again in the last round to gain the
points he needed for victory, but
his display did not win him as
many admirers as did Scott’s. He
seemed, to this writer at least, the
better of the two, but he let his
opponent make all the fight, and
if Scott had overcome a seeming
reluctance to “finish it off” each
time he had Dupas nailed-down,
not even Dupas’s strong finish
would have made-up the leeway
in points.

ADDITION. S
NIXON AND KENNEDY COMPARED
"VTow that the two oppo-
nents in the long contest
for the U.S. Presidency have
emerged—N ix o n for the
Republicans ; Kennedy for the
Democrats —the overseas
papers are lively with com-
parisons of them. A selec-
tion :
James Reston, in the “New
York Times”: “The main point
about these two men is not
that they are so different but
that they are so similar, not
that they are so inexperienced
in Washington but that they
are so much more experienced
in the ways of the capital after
14 years on Capitol Hill than
most of the men nominated
in the past.
“It is true that they are
different in many ways from
each other and from the
traditions of the past, but so
what? The political critics
of the nation, who are, signi-
ficantly, older than the candi-
dates for the first time in many
decades, are in a sour mood
about both Kennedy and
Nixon for the moment; but
Kennedy and Nixon may very
well prove to be nearer to the
needs and to the spirit of the
age than is generally realised.”
* * * '
U.S. correspondent of Lon-
don “Economist”: “No one
can accuse Mr. Kennedy of
indecisiveness. He has used
the momentum of the conven-
tion to start his campaign
rolling, and active Democrats
are being kept so busy that
they have no time to brood
over their dissatisfactions.
And already these are being
drowned in admirafion for Mr.
Kennedy, who has the quali-
ties which all politicians prize
in a candidate —the ability to
organise, the ability to fight
hard, the ability to win.
“These are also the quali-
ties which endear Mr. Nixon
to the Republican party.
Indeed, the two men are strik-
ingly alike, except that Mr.
Kennedy is rich, Mr. Nixon
poor—an odd reversal of the
usual distinction between their
two parties. Both are ruled

“AND NOW WE HAVE THE JUNIOR
FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP!”
by their brains, not their
hearts, and are efficient young
executives making a career of
politics. Both are tough,
articulate campaigners, deter-
mined to succeed, and masters
of the compromises on which
political triumphs are built.”
* * *
Manchester “G uard i a n”
editorial: “It has become
common form to say that
Senator Kennedy and Vice-
President Nixon are much
alike. They are both ‘new
men’ who have since the war
made a national reputation in
Congress. They are both
shrewd and vigorous politicians
and, some say, ruthless in their
use of modern publicity and
organisation. They are not
afraid of new ideas; which-
ever is elected seems likely to
prove a far more dominating
President than Mr. Eisenhower.
So far as it goes this is all
true enough. What is going
to happen, however, is that
one of them will so develop
in the White House as to make
the comparison seem facile.
“This is not to say that the
Presidency must transform
(probably by ennobling it) a
man’s character. On the con-
trary, hindsight allows us to
see that much in the Presiden-
tial careers of (say) Franklin
Roosevelt and Eisenhower
grew out of all they had been
and had done before.
“But it is one thing to see
this and another to predict
which strains in a man’s)
character will come uppermost
in the exercise of office. In
this sense Mr. Nixon and Mr.
Kennedy as potential Presi-
dents are both unknown men.
But Mr. Nixon has the better-
known past; and it is a past
that makes many Democrats
shudder even now, not least
in his own State of California.”

Alistair Cooke, U.S. repre-
sentative of Manchester
“Guardian”: “People who
know [Nixon] well and who
can look at him without
gagging Herblock’s [the widely
syndicated cartoonist’s] feroci-
ous caricature of him (an
unshaven witch over a caul-
dron of hate) say that he is

FailJi in ilic
Fuiwc
Australians will be winging along in spirit
with our young athletes when they fly to Rome
next week to compete in the Olympic Games.
It is a deeply significant event, even by rare
Olympic standards, for the Games this year are
being held at the very centre of that other old
civilisation which was the rival in splendour of
ancient Greece.
The valiants of Grecian sport had been
competing for centuries before the men who had
walked and talked with Christ were bringing the
Christian message out of Asia Minor to them, to
the Romans, and to the world.
The Games had gone on for nearly twelve
centuries before the Roman Emperor, Theodosius,
suppressed them in 394 A.D., and fifteen centuries
more were to pass before their revival at Athens
in 1896.
To one who has lived in Greece and learned
to love that country and its language, and has also
found delight in the grandeur of historic Rome,
as I fortunately have done, this spectacle enacted
to an age-old background is doubly pleasing.
There is, indeed, in the Rome Olympics of
1960 this clear lesson for mankind: that though
civilisations and systems may rise and fall, the
spirit of men striving honestly in their purpose will
always prevail.
Amid the turbulences of the modem world it
is encouraging to see that the rivalries of nations
can be reduced to clean and just encounter on the
fields of sport.
And young Australians will be sharing in this
simple act of faith in the future of mankind. They
will do us honour, in victory or defeat, for the code
of the Olympics is that the triumph is in the trying.
More than that, they will be proclaiming the
quality of our youth, as reflected in the prowess and
sportsmanship they display. That in itself is a rich
contribution to our country’s cause.
So, wishing them well, we can wave them on
in the happy knowledge that, proving themselves
worthy of Australia, they will “run the good race.”

“Plain Dealer” writes:
“We believe we can under-
stand Britain’s apprehension
that months of electioneering,
interminable speeches and par-
tisan hurrah might tend to take
the minds of America’s politi-
cal leaders off today’s big prob-
lem-keeping the world from
Wowing itself up.
‘'But we do not agree with

“But there is reason for
believing that it takes far too
long to elect a U.S. President —
and the reason is that political
practices have failed to keep
up with the times. Years ago,
when candidates had to cover
the nation by railroad, making
whistle-stop speeches, it re-
quired weeks and months. To-
day, on one nation-wide radio
or TV broadcast or telecast, a
candidate can reach in one half-
hour more people than he could
have reached years ago in
months of campaigning.”
Also commenting on the
“Daily Mail” leader, the
Chicago “Sun - Times” notes
that although there is un-
deniably “a good deal of old-
fashioned hoopla” in U.S. elec-
tions, there is also “a defensible
reason” for the time they take:
“The United States is a great
sprawling country, with great
areas of conflicting interests,
differing cultural patterns and
degrees of political sophistica-
tion. It has giant industrial
centres, wide open range-coun-
tries and now, with Alaska and
Hawaii, States flung halfway
around the world.
“By contrast, Great Britain
is smaller than Illinois and
Indiana.
“To bring the 180,000,000
people of the United States
into agreement on one man to
lead them is a great sociological
feat. Because this is a country
that still is growing and chang-
ing, the issues keep changing.
“New issues arise even during
the period of campaigning.
Particularly this year, when a
new man will be selected for
the White House and may be
there for eight years, it is not
too much to ask that the public
give the candidates a long and
hard look.
“Much of America’s strength
comes from the Great Debate
held here every four years.
Americans take political" divi-
sions in stride. The question
was raised during World War
II: Could America afford an
election - campaign while en-
gaged in the greatest war in
history? It could and it did.
“As time goes on we suppose
some of the circus hoopla will
be dropped from the political
show. It is out of place in a
missile world. But, even in a
missile world, there will be
human emotions, and that,
when you come down to it, is
one big reason why the conven-
tions and campaign take on the
aspect of a ‘ritualistic orgy.’

the point where they vote on a
completely unemotional basis

the pattern may change. But,
even in England, we suspect
that the vote is not completely
unemotional.”
Italian Crisis
T ondon “Economist’s” post-
script to the Italian politi-
cal crisis which caused Signor
Tambroni’s Christian Demo-
crat Government, which
depended for its Parliamen-
tary majority on the support
of 24 Neo-Fascist members, to
be replaced by another
Christian Democrat Govern-
ment led by Signor Fanfani
and supported by three centre
parties:
“The anti-Fascist rioting that
began in Genoa on June 30
and spread throughout Italy
taught the Christian Democrats
and the other moderate centre
parties two sharp and salutary
lessons. The first was that
any sign of resurgence by the
Neo-Fascist M. 5.1., at present
a spent force, would be
strongly, perhaps violently,
resented by the country at
large; and consequently that
Signor Tambroni’s expedient
of relying on the Neo-Fascists
for his Parliamentary majority,
which was bound to encourage
their pretensions, could not be
.tolerated for long.
“The second and more
important lesson was that the
Communists, who played an
important part in stimulating
the anti-Fascist- riots and
threatened to start them up
again if Signor Tambroni did
not resign, are ready to exploit
to the uttermost every ounce
of anti-Fascist feeling in Italy
in order to break out of their
increasing isolation and mar-
shal a new popular front.
“This does not mean, as
some alarmist reports sug-
gested, that Italy came near
the brink of civil war. But
in a good many Italian minds
London “Daily Mail."
END OF THE AFFAIR.
the situation must have recalled
the dark days of 1922, when
the moderate centre was
crushed between the battling
extremes —only, today, if the
country came to a similar pass,
it might not be the extremists
of the Right who came out on
top. And it was presumably
because of their common and
lively anxiety to prevent any
slide back towards 1922 that
Signor Moro [secretary of the
Christian Democrats] and the
Social Democrat, Liberal and
Republican leaders (as well as
the leaders of the different
factions inside the Christian
Democrat party) were able to
work-out an understanding
that should at least give Italy
a more broadly based Govern-
ment than the last one.”
Letter to Moscow
'T'he Manchester “Guardian”
voiced a widely felt re-
action when it editorially
described Prime Minister Mac-
millan’s personal letter to
Khrushchev—with its memor-
able sentence: “I simply do
not understand what your
purpose is today”—as “sen-
sible, restrained and to the
point”:
“It was Well worth sending,
even if it may not have much
effect in Moscow. It sets out
the anxieties caused by the
recent conduct of Soviet
foreign policy—the abrupt
ending of disarmament nego-
tiations, the apparently un-
warranted accusations over the
RB-47, and the complaints of
a ‘conspiracy’ in the Congo,
to which the threats over Cuba
might be added —and it says
that the present trend could
lead to a catastrophe.
“This, of course, Mr.
Khrushchev already knows.
He is having to fight his own
battles inside the Kremlin, and
he is probably in no mood to
listen to Mr. Macmillan’s,
quiet remonstrations. If still
faced with the opposition that
led to his change of front just
before the Paris Summit, he
may feel that toughness is his
only course. But there is a
point in making clear to him
—as to others in Moscow —
how much their harsh policy
is disliked and how little they
stand to gain by it.
“There is also a slender
chance that, since a latent
object of that policy is to
divide America from her allies,
its evident failure may help
to turn Russia back to a more
friendly line. - Hope
run high, especially when th
nature of struggle inside fa
Kremlin is so mistily shrouded
but Mr. Macmillan’s I<L’
could be helpful.” r
London “Economist” agrees
that the most i mmedialc
audience for Macmillan’s letter
are Khrushchev’s colleagues
in the Kremlin, or their sub
jects, not all of whom may
stay enamored of his present
rocket-rattling aggressiveness
“if the Soviet Union, as a
result, finds itself lavishing
extravagantly dangerous
guarantees on the Cubans and
others”:
“But there is another audi-
ence as well, and on it Mr,
Macmillan’s .. arguments were
calculated to make an effective
and sensible impression. With
no voice of clear authority
coming out of Washington to
interrupt the chatter of spokes-
men, chiefs-of-staff and' other

Abroad the balance of power

it has been said, may be free —
but one-third is the victim of
cruel repression, and the other
one-third is rocked by the pangs

More energy is released by the

Walter Lippmann, in N.Y.
“Herald Tribune”: “The friend-
ship of our [U.S.] neighbors
can be had when they feel that
there is equality between them
and us. But what can produce
this sense of equality? We
cannot soon be equally rich, or
equally strong, or equally in-
fluential in the world. The
sense of equality which can
breed friendship will come
when we dispel the notion that
our neighbors are under-
developed and struggling while
we are developed and are a
virtually perfected model of a
free society.
“If this country becomes
again the scene of a movement
to improve and reform and
develop itself, we shall again
win friends abroad and influ-
ence them.
“It is no accident but the
very nature of human affairs
that in the times when we have
been most liked and respected
abroad, as under the two
Roosevelts and Wilson, we were
the least smug about our own
affairs and the least satisfied
with ourselves.”

Joachim Joesten, in Edin-
burgh “Scotsman”: “In a purely
material sense, life in East Ger-
many in the past few years has
become a good deal easier than
it used to be, and conditions
may be expected to improve
further as the huge investments
in industrial plants and equip-
ment that have been made in
recent years begin to pay-off
in terms of consumer-goods
and trade.
“No doubt East Germany as
yet is far from matching the
economic power and prosperity
of West Germany. But it no
longer is a poor relative in the
Communist family of nations,
and all indications are that it
will gain further in inter-
national weight in the years
ahead.”

and he thought, who’d be mug
enough to fall for that?
LIE was eating his lunch in the
crib-room down the mine
the next day when he noticed a
red-bearded miner at the end
of the table looking at him
curiously.
The bearded miner smiled at
him and came over to him.
“G’day,” he said, sitting
down. “I’ve been trying to
think where I’ve seen you
before. My name’s Jim.”
Dave, introduced himself and
they shook hands.
Jim asked, “Were you at
Rum Jungle?”
“Yes, I was there for a
while.”
“I knew it!” Jim exclaimed.
“You’re the bloke who half-
killed that Balt in the messroom
that night.”
Dave thought for a moment.
“Which one was that?”
“You know! That Balt who
was always making a nuisance
of himself, throwing the food
all around the table.”
Dave nodded. “Oh, him.
Yes, I remember him now.”
“You went through him like
a threshing-machine,” Jim en-
thused, “and then you cleaned
up his mate outside.”
“Well, he asked for it. He
got it.”
“I’ll say he did!”
Jim’s attitude became very
confidential. He said quietly,
“The boys tell me you’re in
Laurie Melling’s room?”
“That’s right.”
“How do you find him?”
“I don’t know yet. He was
asleep when I moved in yester-
day afternoon. He was still
asleep when I went to bed last
night, and he wasn’t there when
I woke up this morning.”
“You’d better watch him.
He gets nasty when he drinks,
and he handles himself pretty
well.”
“Have you tried him out?”
Jim shook his head. “No,
I haven’t. I don’t know how
I’d go, to tell you the truth.
He doesn’t worry me, though.
But I do know this: when he
hits ’em, they stay hit. I saw
him nail three blokes in the
pub one night, bang, bang,
bang, one after the other and
he didn’t even pause for breath.
And then he just went on drink-
ing as if nothing had happened,
and the three blokes lying cold
on the bar floor. Of course, he
goes looking for trouble. That
notice he’s got there above the
door—”
“I saw that. Does he hire-
out the gear, or something?”
Jim laughed. “Like hell he
does! You don’t just hire-out
the gloves: you hire-out the
gloves with his fists inside
them.”
Dave grinned. “Just a small
standover business, eh? Does
he have many customers?”
“Very few. But it has
happened. Like, you and I

have a bit of a blue over some-
thing, and I knock hell out of
you, see? Now, you mightn’t
be in any condition to do any-
thing about it for a while, so
you go along to Laurie Melling,
give him the brick, and he does
the rest.”
“Doesn’t he ever strike a
snag?”
“He hasn’t yet to my know-
ledge. As I said, when he hits
’em they stay hit. You could
bounce a pickhandle off his
head and he wouldn’t feel it.”
“So you said. But if he’s too
good for one man, what’s to
stop two blokes doing him
over?”
“That’s been thought-of
before,” Jim told him, “but
who’s going to take care of
Laurie’s brothers, Mick and
Tom? And then there’s Albert
Wimple—a bad-looking swine,
if ever you saw one. The four
of them. They all stick to-
gether, and they’re all trouble-
makers, but Laurie’s the worst
so watch him.”
“I’ll do that. Here, do you
want this sandwich?”
Yl7'hen Dave came back to
the barracks off his shift
Laurie Melling was lying on
his bed reading a magazine, a
cigarette lodged comfortably
in the corner of his mouth.
Dave said, “G’day.”
Laurie turned a page of the
magazine. He said, “G’day.”
Dave walked over to him and
held out his hand.
“My name’s Dave Flanni-
gan.”
Laurie gripped his hand and
said, “Mine’s Laurie.” He
released the hand. “You the
bloke’s been cleaning the place
up?”
“That’s me.”
Laurie turned the page over.
“Needed cleaning up. Wind
blows the dust in. Pretty dusty
at times around here.”
“It’s dusty all the way to
Darwin, mate. I rode down
on my bike.”
Laurie grunted. He was read-
ing again.
Dave went over to his bed
and sat down. He took off his
boots and tossed them into the
corner.
Laurie dropped the magazine
to the floor and reached down
aimlessly on the other side of
the bed for more reading-
matter. His hand selected a
pulp western. He studied the
cover and spat his cigarette-
butt across the room. He said :
“I don’t worry about keeping
the place tidy. I usually have
it to myself. It suits me just
the way it is.”
He turned the cover,
and mumbled someth'ng

“Just saying. Get a f ew „

table.
He asked, “Tried out b

“I had a hit.”
“What do you think of it?"
“Good bag. Solid.”
“You need it solid. Keeps’

His hand groped around on
the floor and came up with a
copy of “Male Exclusive.” It
occupied him for 10 minutes,
He turned the pages slowly
studying "some of them very
intently, and when he had
finished he looked across to
Dave and held it up.

and gazed at the ceiling.

“Well, no, I haven’t.” «

roared over their heads:
“Righto, you blokes! How
about giving Laurie a go!”
A gap opened in the crowd,
clear to the drink table, and

A barman smiled quickly at
them. “How goes it, Laurie?”
“Fine, Jack. Just keep that

i Dave had a few beers, then
walked over to the space set
aside for dancing and watched
the couples on the floor.
As Laurie had said, the

The exception was cool,

astl ng his eyes on the blonde
as she danced a succession of
quicksteps and foxtrots and
la bombas and all the other
dances that Dave couldn’t do.
Then the compere an-
nounced: “Take your partners
for an old-fashioned waltz,
please! ”
Dave hurried across the floor
to the blonde and asked
urgently, “Do you waltz?”
“Why yes! Thank you,” she
smiled.
TTe felt stiff and awkward
with her and he
knew his footwork was terrible.
It was like the first time he’d
had a fight in the ring with
gloves on.
He was nervous. But he
had time only to introduce
himself and find out that her
name was Susan before a heavy
hand fell on his shoulder and
a familiar voice said, “Righto,
you’ve had her long enough.
How about giving Laurie a
go?”
They stopped dancing. Dave
looked at Laurie and told him
politely: “Go away, mug.”
Laurie seemed shocked.
“Nobody calls me that,” he
said.
“So what are you going to
do about it?” Dave asked,
gently pushing the blonde to
the sidelines.
“Put ’em up,” Laurie said,
“because I’m going to knock
your head in.”
Dave back-pedalled and they
began to circle; the crowd
formed a ring around them ;
the women screamed and
implored them to stop; the
piano and drums switched to
a loud, fast version of “The
Darktown Strutters’ Ball.”
Dave waited for Laurie to
make his move. He knew that
he would probably only have
the chance of one good punch.
The big man came in swing-
ing. Dave side-stepped and
ducked under the swinging
fists. Then he brought up his
right in a mighty uppercut,
driven by the power of his
legs, back and arms. It con-
nected, and the shock stunned
his arm down to the shoulder.
The blow was heard even
above the musical accompani-
ment.
Laurie looked briefly sur-
prised. He smiled foolishly,
then his eyes turned back into
his head. He knelt gracefully
before Dave, head bowed,
then he rolled over on his side.
He was out cold.
■pvAVE had a confused picture
of events immediately after
that.
The crowd seemed to surge
around him and he felt him-
self being pushed out of the
hall by the weight of bodies ;
then he was in the cool night
air and someone said, “You’d
better go while the going’s
good.”
He walked back to the bar-
racks and lay on his bed in
the dark and rubbed his fist and
wondered if any bones were
broken.
About half-an-hour later the
bearded miner, Jim, came into
the room, switched-on the light
and said, “What are you doing
there? Are you hurt? I thought
you’d be half-way to Darwin
by now.”
“What would I be going to
Darwin for? I just came from
there.”
“Listen, mate,” Jim said
patiently, “you’d better leave
that ’heroic stuff to Marlon
Brando and blokes like that.
You know what you did to
him? You broke his jaw in two
places, that’s what! ”
“Yeah?”
“Yeah. Now, Laurie can’t
do anything about it for a
while, but there’s his brothers
to think of, and Albert Wimple.
They’ll be coming for you.
They’re at the hospital now,
but when they leave there
they’ll come back here and
kick hell out of you.”
“You think so?”
“Do I think so?” Jim began
to lose patience. “I’m telling
you, I know that mob. Now
listen, feller. That was a mighty
hit, but it could have been a
lucky one, too. He doesn’t
usually leave himself open like
that. I know you’re good, but
I wouldn’t like your chances
against the three of them. Why
don’t you bunk in with me to-
night and in the morning clear
out of here as fast as you can.
What do you say?”
Dave shook his head. “I
like it here. I’m staying.”
“Have it your way,” Jim said,
walking towards the door. He
stopped and said, “if you need
any help”—
“I’ll be 0.k., thanks.”
“Whatever you say. That
was a mighty hit, feller. A
mighty hit.”
Dave made a few prepara-
tions for the night. He went
outside and. searched around
until he found a handy-sized
length of hardwood. He took
it back to the room and laid it
alongside his bed. Then he
placed the table and the two
chairs a few feet in from the
doorway. Finally, he took the
bulb out of the light-socket.
He lay on his bed and
thought about the blonde
schoolteacher, Susan. He was
still thinking about her when
he went to sleep.
TJE was awakened by the
noise of a chair being kicked
over, and voices. He sat up.
A voice said, “What’s wrong
with the bloody light?”
“I dunno. It won’t work.
Strike a match.”
“Is he here?”
Dave recognised the voices
of Mick Melling and Albert
Wimple. A third man was
framed in the doorway.
Dave gripped the hardwood
club and stood up.
The match spluttered, illumi-
nating the scene and Tom Mel-
ling said, “There he is!”
“Yes,” agreed Dave, “here
I am.”
Albert Wimple said, “You
know that Laurie’s in hospi-
tal?”
“So I heard.”
“Well, he sent us along to
give you something.”
They came towards him and
the match went out.
Mick said, “What’s wrong
with that light, anyway?”
“Forget about the light,”
Albert said. “This won’t take
long.”
Mick struck another match
and Albert Wimple went up to
Dave, who stood ready with the
hardwood club. Dave had
great faith in a piece of hard-
wood when the weights weren’t
even.
Albert said surlily, “Laurie
sent us along to give you this.”
He put his hand into his
pocket and took something out.
“Here, take it,” he said, holding
out a £lO note.
The match went out.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIMD
Beatniks and Buddhism
Commenting on Lawrence
Lipton’s The Holy Barbarians
(claimed to be the “Bible” of
the Beatniks), a Sydney book-
reviewer made some much-to-
the-point accusations against
what has been called “a grimy
social blot.” He accused
Beats of being without moral
standards, of feeling “free to
sleep with whom they choose,”
of allowing their children to be
brought-up “in conditions of
utmost squalor amid an atmo-
sphere of marijuana - smoking,
drunken orgies and ear-piercing
jive,” of living and breeding
“in a spiritual dung-heap, their
haunts littered with dirty dishes,
rejected manuscripts, bills and
bottles of booze.”
If such is the case it’s
astonishing that so little is
being done about it. Beatniks
may be social misfits, “dis-
tressed neurotics” and the
like, but can be also a grave
social menace—all the more
dangerous because they claim
a “philosophical” basis for their
way of life and manage to get
some of their books on the
market.
Even more astonishing is
that their so-called philosophy
is said to be based on a
Westernised version of Zen
Buddhism. Japanese Bushido
(code of chivalry) is also sup-
posed to be inspired by Zen ;
and, whatever we may think of
Japanese chivalry, we may well
be puzzled as to how such
opposing standards of behavior
can possibly have resulted from
a study of the same system.
Most astonishing of all is
that, so far as I know, no
Buddhist has yet repudiated the
Beatnik claim. The reason is
to be found, of course, in the
equally astonishing measure of
tolerance practised by adherents
of this venerable religious
philosophy.
Zen is in no sense an ortho-
dox school of Buddhism, yet,
like other sects, it does accept
the fundamental teachings of
the Buddha. “Cease to do
evil; learn to do good ; purify
your own heart. This is the
teaching of the Buddhas,” are
among the precepts accepted by
all schools.
Then there is the Noble
Eightfold Path, a spiritual way
every Buddhist hopes to tread
sooner or later—the path of
right thought, right motives,
right speech, right conduct,
right means of livelihood, right
effort, right control of the mind,
right concentration.
There are also the five
promises made -to themselves,
and often honored by Buddhists
of all schools: vows to refrain
from taking life, from stealing,
from unchastity, from lying
and from indulgence in intoxi-
cants.
Scriptures are filled with
injunctions concerning the
wisdom of practising strict
morality, stern self-discipline,
“It's a survey , see, pal. Does the Queen smoke
king-size?”
loving-kindness and compas-
sion for our fellows. Beatniks
are said to be disorderly and
dirty which hardly squares
with Buddhist instructions on
meditation (“musing” is a more
correct term): one must first
bathe, shave and eat.
Throughout the many cen-
turies of its existence, Zen has
demanded of its followers the
most rigorous self-discipline in
preparation for the colossal
task of (in Christian termino-
logy) “taking the Kingdom of
Heaven by storm.” The best
cure I can imagine for Beat-
nikism would be to herd all its
practitioners into genuine Zen
monasteries and subject them
to the rigors of the order for a
week or two.
But, in fairness to Zen, it
must be acknowledged that its
teachings have not come
directly to the Beats but
through Alan Watts’s European
version of it, The Way of Zen.
Again, in fairness to Watts, I
confess I’m at a loss to under-
stand how his ideas can have
been misconstrued and made
an excuse for living the Beatnik
way. I cannot find in his
writings a single statement
which has not already been
made by medieval Christian
mystics, William Blake and a
host of others. In his latest
work Watts admits he has
changed some of his theories.
Who wouldn’t, if accused of
being the inspiration of the
Beats?
No sincere Buddhist, of any
School or sect, would allow that
the Beatniks can find the
slightest trace of authority in
the Dharma (Buddhist teach-
ing) for their way of life.
Buddhists would also object to
the titles of some Beat books:
The Dharma Bums, for ex-
ample, may be regarded as an
insult to a teaching which for
more than 2500 years has been
the source of inspiration to
countless millions on this
planet.— Maitri (N.S.W.).

Magnoon (Q.).
The First Camels
As far as I can ascertain, the
first advocate of the introduc-
tion of camels to Australia was
the “Sydney Herald” (later
“Sydney Morning Herald”),
which in September, 1839,
urged that the animals were
“admirably adapted to the
climate and soil of New South
Wales.” The “Monitor,” a
rival sheet, opposed this pro-
ject, upon which it was accused
“See if you can do some sunbathing before you come
home — I've told everyone you are holidaying on the
Gold Coast."
by the “Herald” of indulging
in “vulgarisms” and “fudgery.”
Camels did, it appears, show-
up locally in the next year.
But what support is there for
the statement by James Hol-
ledge (B. 22 /6 / ’6O) that in 1840
a solitary camel landed from
the Oppoline at Port Adelaide
and that it was the sole sur-
vivor of a batch of nine im-
ported by brothers named
Phillips?
My information is that two
camels, a male and a female,
arrived in 1840, that they were
landed from the Calcutta at
Hobart, that they were ex-
hibited in Melbourne soon
afterwards by a man named
Ardlie, and that later again they
were overlanded to Sydney.
Meanwhile they had increased
their number to three. Then,
being bought by the N.S.W.
Government (price, £225), they
were placed on view in Sydney
Domain—after which . . . ?
It’s true that the Phillips
brothers imported a camel to
Adelaide—the sole survivor of
nine that started out from the
Canary Isles —but according to
my records that lonely migrant
didn’t arrive until 1846. It
then became the property of
the explorer J. A. Horrocks,
and inadvertently killed him
through bumping a loaded gun.
None of those pioneering
camels made any real impres-
sion on the Australian scene.
The distinct impact came
through a batch of 24 brought-
in by the Victorian Govern-
ment for the Burke and Wills
enterprise (1860), through a
larger batch imported to S.A.
by Sir Thomas Elder a few
years later, and through an
even larger consignment (259)
introduced to S.A. in 1886 by
a couple of Afghans.
During at least 70 years these
'“ships of the desert” shared
very notably in the development
of the Australian interior. Their
usefulness dwindled almost to
vanishing-point with the up-
surge of motor-transport, and
in later years their feral descen-
dants have been shot as pests —
to the tune, in one instance
during the 1930’5, of 153 in a
single day. Phil Anthus
(N.S.W.).
The Fishing Industry
Evidence given before the
State Development Committee,
which has visited eight ports
around the Victorian coast over
the past 10 months, strongly
suggests that this important
food-industry can be expanded
by judicious Government
action.
Of primary importance is
control of seals. It is calculated
that seals account for more fish
than are taken by fishermen,
and they damage nets and other
gear to the tune of thousands
of pounds a year. They are
believed.to be increasing
rapidly. Some experts go as
far as to say there are 80,000
in Victorian waters alone, but
a more accurate figure is likely
to be 20,000. Positive control-
measures are obviously needed,
especially in bays and estuaries.
Not far behind in urgency is
the need to help new men get
started in the industry. A sea-
worthy fishing-boat (not on the
scale of the ocean-going shark-
boat) costs £2OOO to buy and
equip. It is therefore patent
that the industry will have
difficulty in attracting new-
comers and in maintaining
those already in it. This is the
case today, with family units
operating and boats, etc., being
handed down from father to
son.
Improved marketing-methods
also seem necessary. Co-opera-
tives established around the
coast since War II have fulfilled
a storage-need, but have fallen-
down in one important par-
ticular. They deep-freeze fish
as soon as they are caught,


then send them as required to
metropolitan markets, where
they are frozen again until
finally they reach the table.
Fish would be more palatable
and more readily saleable if
double- freezing could be
avoided.
Then there is bay-pollution.
New industries sited around
the shores of Port Phillip IJay
have made their mark on
fishes’ breeding- and feeding-
grounds. Oil-refineries on the
western shores of the bay are
causing particular concern. Oil-
waste has killed kelp and
marine-growth on which cer-
tain fish spawn and feed. Waste
has been sighted as far away
as 12 miles from a refinery, and
as it spreads it will surely kill-
off many varieties of fish.
This evidence, which the
committee will no doubt give
full weight to in its report to
Parliament, seems to be a
basis on which the Govern-
ment can tackle the rehabilita-
tion of an important industry
which, instead of expanding
w 4 th our population, has done
the reverse.— Plain Austra-
lian (Vic.).
“Red Robbie”
Tell R. G. Hodge (B.
27 /7 / ’6O) that I did give the
late General Robertson credit
for being a dashing Light Horse
officer in War I. But all of
Robertson’s reputation as a
combat leader in War II was
based on the taking of Ben-
ghazi—from Italians who had
no heart for fighting.
I knew three men who were
there, and all said Robertson’s
tactics would have led to disas-
ter if he had tried them “when
we were fighting Germans in
Greece later on.”
I saw correspondence in
which Robertson pressed for
the retention of the Armored
Division in W.A. when the
threat of Japanese invasion was
over. /
Now for my other state-
ments.
After enlisting I was
appointed a specialist instruc-
tor. Before going to Robert-
son’s division I had received
only commendations from
generals such as Waldron —
when I was on loan to the U.S.
forces —and Murray.
After I’d been nine weeks at
Mullewa (W.A.), with all ranks
up to brigadier attending my
classes, Robertson arrived one
day, personally ordered four
men out of the class of 30 to
be put on charge-sheets as “in-
correctly dressed,” then ordered
me to be charged with the same
offence, plus “badge of rank
not showing.” I tried to ex-
plain, but was cut short with:
“One line from me on a sheet
of paper—and back to the
ranks you go!”
The charges against the other
men were dismissed —even the
old Prussian Army might have
had difficulty in punishing men
for wearing ragged uniforms
when the Q.M. had nothing
new to issue and when
Robertson found I belonged to
H.Q. he ordered me back to
Perth.
There my C.O. placed the
facts before Gordon Bennett,
and I was sent back to Mul-
lewa. I was shown—unofficially
—a copy of the letter in which
six separate reprimands were
administered to Robertson.
Among other things it pointed
out that I had put on a much-
worn overall because what I
had to demonstrate would have
played havoc with either of my
two presentable uniforms.
I thought I would now
occupy the position of a foot-
ball —kicked by both sides. But
I was- told—again unofficially
—that Robertson had been
“putting men on charges for
trifling offences or none at all,
and the Bloke here is doing
something about it.” I was
assured that I would be left at
Mullewa “only long enough to
prove that a dim view is taken
of these cases” and would then
be sent to another unit.
Back at Mullewa I found my
lot quite bearable, as most of
the officers sided with me. I
duly went on to Queensland,
Torres Straits, New Guinea
and New Britain. Never again
did I find myself in any kind
of trouble. To save a repetition

ithere is much more evi-

with Hamilton at the peak of
his career (just back from
Port Phillip and just married),
Andrew wrote a letter home,
giving, I don’t doubt, an
appreciative account of both
the trip and the marriage.
It was read by a nephew,
the Rev. Abraham Hume,
D.D., LL.D., F.S.A., co-
founder of the Lancashire and
Cheshire Historical Society ;
but it was not until 1845 that
Abraham wrote a letter to
Andrew which sparked a
correspondence between them
that lasted for four years and,
what is more important,
between Abraham and Hamil-
ton Hume that was to last for
28 years. Here it is in part: —•
I have been trying on several

At present, these facts are lost,
and I find it an insuperable
obstacle in tracing pedigrees and
lineage.
1 have long entertained the idea
of writing a history of the family
of Hume, one of the most dis-
tinguished in the British Empire,
which has the following illustrious
dignities connected with it:
7 Earldoms Northumberland,
Dunbar, March, Moray,
Marchmont, Hume, Zetland.

1 Viscountess (Duncan); 8
Baronesses (Dalkeith, Seton,
Crichton, Forpichen, Erskine,
Polwarth, Basgamy and
Lovat).
I think that the possession of
their dignities is apology sufficient
for wishing to set such a family
fairly before the world; and I
trust it will stimulate you to give
me any assistance in your power.
Any of your grandchildren
would save you the trouble of
writing by taking down from your
dictation, a narration of your
voyage out, of your early adven-
tures in the colony and of any-
thing of note in your progress thus
far; so that the pedigree being
properly given, your own personal
narration and Cousin Hamilton’s
could come in at their respective
places. I trust you will not lose
sight of this matter.
I have written to Cousin Hamil-
ton on another subject, which 1
beg to recommend to you also;
it is that one of your grand-
children, at least, be sent home
to England for education. John
speaks highly of little Hamilton,
son of Rawdon, and therefore 1
mention him. I need hardly say,
that anything I can do, will be
done gladly and cheerfully done,
if you all think of it; and that
I will return him to you, in any
of the professional forms that his
own dispositions suit, or your
united wishes point out. And in
the matter of expense, there is no
question, that it is the cheapest
way in which he can ever be
provided for.
It is interesting to speculate
whether such an erudite cleric
would continue to correspond
with an “illiterate” colonial
cousin and, what is more,
ultimately press him to lay
claim to the dormant title of
Marchmont, which Abraham
did! It should dispose of the
“senility” question, too!
'T'he John Hume mentioned
was Abraham’s brother.
He came to Australia in 1833
and retired to England in 1845.
Not particularly liked, appar-
ently, he spent a lot of his
time with the John Kennedy
Humes at Collingwood,
Gunning—Hamilton’s second
brother’s family.
Here, to distinguish him
from John K. Hume, he was
surreptitiously christened
“Johnny-come-lately.” “Little
Hamilton” never took advan-
tage of Abraham’s offer, but
became instead the explorer’s
right-hand man till 1865. He
was my grandfather.
The history mentioned was
written —a beautiful job. Two
copies came to Australia. They
were leather-bound, with the
crest of the parent-house
(Home) on the cover and those
of the various branches shown
on the margins of the pages
dealing with them.
The family here paid their
share of the cost by sending
a bale of wool to London for
sale. But alas for the books!
One copy was wantonly
destroyed by children, the
other was “impounded” by a
firm of solicitors pending a
decision as to ownership in the
1930’5. It can’t be traced.
However, what is important
is whether Andrew and
Hamilton’s letters to Abraham
still exist. Taking into account
the calibre of the man to whom
they were written, I would say
there is a good chance that
they do. Since they covered
that controversial period from
1853 to 1873, how much would
they mean to anyone seeking
new light on Andrew and
Hamilton Hume —particularly
the latter? It is towards this
correspondence that I am
directing my own research.
Hamilton’s mother died in
1847 and rests in the vault
of her son John Kennedy
Hume, whom Whitton mur-
dered in 1840 at Gunning.
Andrew Hume died in 1849
and is with his daughter
Isabella in the Barber vault at
Marulan. Up to the time of
their deaths I would say that
the parents were the two most
important people in Hamil-
ton Hume’s life —Elizabeth
Dight, his wife, included.
This might give the impres-
sion that Hamilton’s marriage
was not happy. That there
were no children of the union
was a great blow to Hamilton,
and no doubt to his wife. He
was to find the son he needed
in “Little Hamilton” —Raw-
don Hume’s eldest son.
Elizabeth? We don’t know
much, but we do know that
she remained a faithful wife
for 48 years —some of them,
at the finish, very difficult
years.
Hamilton had many out-
standing interests, Elizabeth
virtually none. As Hamilton
tended to gather his own
around him, so Elizabeth
tended to gather hers. There
seems little doubt, though,
that the most important person
in Hamilton’s life after the
death of his parents was Little
Hamilton. He was the favored
nephew, and the promise he’d
shown to John Hume was
fulfilled.
The activities of these two
were to do almost as much
again in another sphere for
Australia as Hamilton had
done by his exploration. The
close association of the two
Hamiltons with so much in
common was not broken till
1865, and if a date is to be
arbitrarily fixed for the decline
of the explorer’s physical and
mental condition that is it.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON 'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO.
GRAZCOS."
THE QUARTER-HORSE IN AUSTRALIA
From D.S. ROBERTSON
Tll7hen the quarter-horse was
** introduced into Australia
many cattlemen viewed the
newcomer with a critical eye.
Compared with the bigger,
rangier Australian stock-horse
the quarter-horse was smaller,
more compact. How would it
stand up to a hard day’s mus-
tering in the heat?
These doubts about the horse
from Texas have now been
dispelled. The quarter-horse
has proved a tough, willing
worker with a heart as big as
your hat. This is not surpris-
ing, when you investigate its
background.
The quarter-horse got its
name from the two-furlong
races in which it excelled.
These quarter-mile races, popu-
lar in the early days of
colonial America, disappeared
from the race-programmes
when thoroughbreds better
suited to longer distances —were
imported into America in the
first half of the 19th century.
The Communist world’s
greasy wool produc-
tion, according to recent
reports, was estimated
at 1093 million lb'. The
production figure was
then divided into the
various countries that
Communism covers:
The Soviet Union, 765
million lb.; Eastern
Europe (includes
Albania, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary,
Poland and Rumania),
148 million lb.; while
China, Mongolia and
Tibet contributed 180
million lb.
It is not claimed, but
a known tact that
lambs marked and
tailed by the Elastrator
method of castrating
and tailing are less
likely to become victims
of fly-strike and diseases
associated with old?
fashioned methods such
as the knife. The
Elastrator Rubber Ring
method is safe, sure
and, above all, humane.
The pioneers of the West
took the quarter-horse with
them. On the rugged, western
range country the horse became
the favorite of the American
cowpuncher. To give the horse
greater stamina the early
ranchers crossed it with the
The typical quarter-horse.
Spanish criollo, “the horse of
the plains.”
In the early days of the rip-
roaring, rough-living West a
good cow-horse was worth its
weight in gold. The ranchers
never neglected an opportunity
to improve their horses by selec-
tive breeding and by crossing
them with pure quarter-horses
imported into the West from
the rapidly dwindling numbers
back East.
They then crossed some with
the English thoroughbred, and
this last cross saw the birth of
the quarter-horse as we know
it today.
About the second half of
last century the quarter-horse
—or the “short horse,” as it
was known among the cow-
punchers of the prairies—really
came into its own. A thorough-
bred named Sir Archy, which
stood at least 16 hands and
excelled in four-mile races,
sired such famous quarter-
horses as Gray Archy and
Timoleon. The speed of the
quarter - horse, its agility
amongst the rocks and stunted
trees on the hillsides and plains
made it the “horse of the
West.”
The present - day quarter-
horse is the result of a long
programme of breeding at King
Ranch, in Texas. The founda-
tion-sire was Old Sorrel, one
of the greatest cow-horses in
American history ; he was 30
when he died in 1945.
Old Sorrel was sired by
Hickory Bill from a Dr. Rose
mare. The mare’s history is
lost in the fog of equine history,
but her appearance suggests
that she carried a large dose of
English thoroughbred in her
veins.
Old Sorrel was a cow-horse
of exceptional quality and
handled beautifully. A tireless
worker, he had such a good
disposition that he never be-
came sour or cranky, no matter
how much he was worked. For
beauty and conformation he.
left the other stallions in the
shade.
Previous attempts at mating
with other sires had shown that
even after they had *
their merit for breeding!!]
failed to carry for War § d !
more than one generation
Sorrel was mated with
the best-handling niarp „ 01
King Ranch, to see if he *
the exception. The mares We
either grade or pure thoj
breds. In order to fix the J.
blood one of his sons Soli
was mated with the f eraa i
sired by Old Sorrel. i n t .
course of time Solis was maid
with approximately 40 of t
half-sisters, mostly f roi|
thoroughbred mares.
As soon as they were olf
enough all horses were broken
and ridden. Only those mares
with sound conformation aj|
easy saddle-manners were re.
tained for further breed®
Of all the progeny, those sirti
by Solis were outstanding,
As the breeding-program® ,
advanced, the progeny *1 s

How is it making-out in Aus-
tralia?
At first, experienced stock-
men wondered if these horses
would be too slow for fast
cattle on hard ground. (As the
quarter-horse is smaller than
the average Australian stock-
horse it has a smaller stride.)
Well, you would have to look
in a lot of corners to find any-
thing faster than Herefords on
granite country; yet the
quarter-horse can more than
hold his own there. It all
comes back to the fact that
these horses were built for
speed over two furlongs.
Of the fourteen colts and
fillies already broken-in on
King Ranch (Aust.) at Risdon,
near Warwick (Q.), all have
proved themselves to be ex-
cellent hacks and stock-horses.
Quarter-horses will become
popular with polocrosse-

which calls for a horse that can

Dog Menace
“Wimra”: In the Victorian
Wimmera uncontrolled dogs
have become a serious menace
in both town and country.
Dogs, apparently ownerless,
since they have no collars or
other evidence of being legally
registered, roam the streets,
invade private property, com-
mit nuisances, become traffic-
hazards, and even at times
attack children.
Local councils do what they
can, even calling on police to
destroy dogs proved dangerous.
But there are always a few
dog-owners who evade the most
rigidly enforced registration
and allow their pets to run free
by night as well as by day.
Once these dogs go outside
the town they inevitably get
among sheep and, as their
worrying becomes rougher,
develop into sheepkillers.
One farmer on the outskirts
of Horsham, after losing several
sheep in raids, found his flock
frightened into being practic-
ally unmanageable. His de-
clared intention of shooting
every trespassing dog was sup-
ported by townsfolk annoyed
by stray dogs, and when, after
a mid-morning raid, he fol-
lowed home the Alsatian-cross
leader of a pack which had
killed 10 of his sheep and badly
mauled ewes about to lamb
eyen the owner had to acquiesce
in its destruction.
Official permission was
granted for this dog to be shot
within the city boundaries,
After other dogs—one of them
a child’s pet—had killed 13
sheep and harassed ewes and
lambs in a morning attack,
authorisation was extended to
all townsfolk in that section,
empowering them to shoot all
dogs seen molesting sheep.
In Stawell, too, stray pet-
dogs from the town have be-
come such a menace that one
farmer has in three months
lost 29 sheep (valued at over
£100) killed and many others
injured.
Must it be left to individual
sufferers to combat such a
menace?
Wheat Trials
“Bottlejaw”: Experiments on
Queensland’s southern Darling
Downs by officers of the De-
partment of Agriculture show,
after five-years’ trial on soil
cultivated for 30 years, that the
application of superphosphate
reduces wheat-yields slightly.
Superphosphate was applied
at the rate of 2cwt. an acre to
18 plots. One half of each plot
received super., the other half
none ; stubble was ploughed at
varying depths from 4in. to
Bin.; then the fertiliser was
spread in the furrow, so that
it was applied at different
depths.
Average yields over five years
were greater for the unferti-
lised areas than for the fer-
tilised, except in two plots
where there was no difference.
Differences in depth of
ploughing showed most in the
first three years. There was
bulkier growth in the deeper-
ploughed plots during this
period. In the last two years,
because of drought, no differ-
ence was apparent.
These trials show that there’s
little point in applying super,
to wheat planted on the black
and dark-grey clay-soils in the
district. But that doesn’t mean
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(28/7/’60)
In Queensland reasonably good rains are indicated for
the coastal, central-highlands, Darling Downs, Maranoa and
Warrego regions during August, but falls will probably be
poor elsewhere. Light to moderate rains, mainly below
normal, are likely during September and October, with good
rains in a large part of the State in November.
Rainfall will probably be patchy in N.S.W. during
August, apart from reasonably good rains in the coastal,
tablelands and north-western areas. Light rains, generally
below normal, are indicated for September, with light to
moderate rain in October. There should be good rains in
November.
Victoria is likely to have moderate rains, mainly below
normal, during August, apart from reasonably good rains
in the east-central, upper-north-east and west-coastal areas.
Good general rains can be expected in September.
Moderate and below-normal rains are indicated for agri-
cultural areas of South Australia during August, with light
rain in the Murray Valley and poor rain in the interior.
There should be light to moderate rains in the agri-
cultural areas of Western Australia during August, with
light rain also likely elsewhere, but conditions dry in the
northern areas.

from super.
If in doubt, rather than
spend a lot on fertiliser which
may not repay the expense, try
running super, through with
the seed on a few trial-runs

dock, checking results to see if
there is any improvement.
Another significant thing
these trials showed was that
depth of ploughing had no
effect on protein-content of the
wheat.
Beef-cattle Research
“Zorok”: The N.S.W.
Graziers’ Association hopes
that money will be made avail-
able from the Federal Govern-
ment’s Beef - cattle Research
Fund for beef-research at the
University of New England
and the nearby C.5.1.R.0.
Research Station. Both estab-
lishments have facilities for
doing this work, the association
claims, and graziers believe
that northern coastal parts of
N.S.W. have great potential for
beef production, so the Univer-
sity and the C.5.1.R.0. could
extend their research into the
area.
A northern grazier, R. B.
Ramsay, told the last meeting
of the Graziers’ Association
that there were a million cattle
in the pleuro.-protected area of
the North Coast, but that no
research had been carried-out
in the area except on pasture.
Helped by research on beef,
Ramsay said, the area should
be able to carry a greater
number of cattle.
The Graziers’ Association at
the same meeting decided to
press for an Australia-wide
campaign to do away with
pleuro. and to ask the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture
what it was doing in this
matter.
Graziers on the North Coast
of N.S.W. are concerned about
"W hat’s it like in?"
cattle being brought into their
pleuro.-free area, even when
transported in sealed floats
for immediate slaughtering at
coastal meatworks. The meet-
ing rejected a motion which
would have allowed that to be
done.
Rhodes-grass
“Belar”: Rhodes - grass
o Chloris gayana ), a perennial
from South Africa, thrives in
most of Queensland and
N.S.W. within the 20in.
rainfall belt. It does best on
alluvial and loamy soils, but
also grows on lighter soils —
granitic and sandstone —-
wherever there is warmth. It
is sensitive to frost, but soon
recovers in warm weather.
The seed is very light and
germination is usually poor.
To test fertility, take a pinch
of seed and rub it firmly in
the palm of the hand to
separate grain from husk. If
the grain is plentiful and of
a transparent yellow color the
seed should give a good
strike.
To make the best seedbed,
seed should be broadcast in
the ashes after a “burn.” If
it is to be sown on cultivated
land, bring the ground to a
fine tilth and broadcast at the
rate of 41b. to 61b. an acre,
half the seed being strewn
north and south, and the
remainder east and west for
equal distribution. Alterna-
tively, 31b. of seed may be
mixed with 2cwt. of super-
phosphate and drilled-in with
a wheat-combine. The
ground should be moist
enough to keep young plants
growing steadily. Spring is
the best time to sow, but, if
this is not practicable,
February or March seeding
will give good results.
When runners appear the
grass is well established and
will stand a fair amount of
dry weather, but do not
graze too early, because
runners take some time to
become firmly rooted and
stock may pull them out of
the ground. To encourage
good establishment it is best
to cut the first crop for hay,
or allow it to go to seed and
then graze it. Although
foliage may be a little tough,
stock will keep it down if
they are kept on it. After
this crop, stock may be
depastured at any stage, but
the grass should be eaten
right to the ground.

Grazing Oafs
“Mulga”: The methods
used when grazing an oat-
crop will determine whether
there has been full value for
the outlay in growing it. It
Queensland, oats is the prin-
cipal and best grazing-crop

In normal conditions a crop
of oats is ready for grazing

Bloody Necklace his name.
Jione and another lad were
spear-diving off the Liku at
Hau’ulaufuli. They worked
in shifts, one manning the
canoe and watching-out for
sharks on the surface, while
the other went down.
After a long dive, so long
that it began to worry his
companion, Jione shot-up to
the surface, his face ghastly,
''his eyes staring blindly, and
blood streaming from punc-
tures that encircled his neck
and throat.

When he was able to sit-up
and drink from a brim-full
green coconut which the other
brought, he said, “Koe ngatala

came quickly from a big hole
in the rock with his mouth
open and tried to swallow me.
He got my head in his mouth
and shut his jaws tight. I
could not do anything but
hold to the rock at the side
of the hole while he squeezed
my neck. When all time was
finished and my head and my
chest would burst, he opened
his jaw, I think to take my
body in, but the air rushed
from my body into his mouth
and he went back quickly in
his house in the rock and I
came quick to the top. I was
very near to die that time.”
And so “Bloody Necklace

where Phalaris tuberosa is in
small proportions to other
grasses. The disease is often
fatal, and no animal ever com-
pletely recovers. No one
knows exactly what causes it,
but it is thought to come from
some toxic agent not yet identi-
fied.
Symptoms are commonly a
stagger like a drunken man,
accompanied by violent nod-
ding of the head. Affected
animals become very excitable,
and any of the normal handling
activities droving, drafting,
dipping, and so on —will pre-
cipitate an attack. Sheep with
phalaris-staggers are sometimes
seen moving about on their
knees, while collapse and death
will often follow.
All this, and the fact that
both prevention and cure can
be brought about by the use
of cobalt, has been known for
some time. Late in 1953 the
C.5.1.R.0. published suggested
methods of control: one by
dosing, and the other by top-
dressing. Neither was regarded
as a final answer, because
dosing called for weekly hand-
ling of stock, and was therefore
expensive; the effect of top-
dressing was sometimes short-
lasting, because heavy rain
would leach the cobalt away.
The next step, details of
which were published in 1958,
was to dose animals with a
heavy pellet, made-up under
pressure, of cobalt and china-
clay. This pellet was designed
to lie in the animal’s belly,
and “leak” cobalt constantly in
minute quantities. Tests proved
the effectiveness of this treat-
ment, but disadvantages later
appeared. The animal would
sometimes fail to retain the
pellet, and often, especially in
young stock, the pellet would
be found to have become
coated with calcium-phosphate,
which would act as a mask or
seal, preventing the cobalt
leakage.
The C.5.1.R.0. did not allow
the matter to remain there, and
further experiments have now
led to an improved pellet—a
cobalt - bullet without these
faults. To prevent loss of the
bullet, it has been made heavier
and denser. To prevent coat-
ing, an ingenious but down-to-
earth remedy was tried and
proved: with each bullet, an
engineer’s grub-screw is fed to
the animal. This is similar in
size and shape to the bullet,
and both lodge together in the
rumen. There is constant move-
ment as the beast moves about
and feeds, and this causes the
two “foreign bodies” to rub
together. The thread on the
grub-screw then acts very much
like a file, scraping the bullet
clean and preventing the
accretion of any coat.
Cobalt-bullets, now being
made by a number of firms,
come in two sizes; the larger,
for cattle, is called Formula D
(replacing Formula B); and the
smaller, for sheep, is called C
(the older type was Formula
A). Great numbers have been
sold both here and overseas.
This all means significant
help for many farmers, and
yet another feather in the cap
of the C.5.1.R.0., which has
repeatedly shown itself to be
one of their best friends.

Who invented, and who manu-
factures, the Hovercraft ? How does
it work ?
The Hovercraft employs a funda-
mentally different lift-principle from
that of any aircraft or ship; that
is, the generation of a cushion of
air under the bottom surface of
sufficient pressure to support the
machine so that it rides just clear
of the waves or over the land.
The principle is the discovery of
an electronics-engineer, C. S.
Cockerell.
The vehicle weighs about four
tons and is in oval form, with a
major diameter of 30ft., a width
of 24ft. and a height of 10ft. at
the central column. A large part
of this “flying-saucer” forms a
buoyancy tank, and an .Alvis
Leonides engine delivering 435
horsepower drives a four-bladed
axial-fan situated vertically in the
central column. Air is drawn
through this and expelled round
the periphery, forming a cushion
which supports the machine at a
height of about 15 inches. Air
is also bled-off to horizontal nozzles
which allow the machine to be
moved in any direction.
The Hovercraft has been
developed by Saunders-Roe, Ltd.,
under a contract placed by the
National Research Development
Corporation.

Who comprise, and what are the
functions of, the Australian Trans-
port Advisory Council ?
The council is comprised of the
Commonwealth Minister for Ship-
ping and Transport, the Common-
wealth Ministers for National
Development, Interior, Army and
Territories, and each State Minister
for Transport.
Its functions are to report to

Recent controversy over the
independence of New Guinea has
led to arguments over the extent
of the Territory. Please define
its extent and give some details of
the Trusteeship ?
The German possessions on the
mainland of New Guinea and cer-
tain adjacent islands were occupied
by Australian forces on Sept. 12,
1914. On Dec. 17, 1920, a mandate
of the Supreme Council of the
Allies entrusted the administration
to the Australian Government, and
the administration was established
on May 9, 1921. The Territory
is now placed under the Trustee-
ship system of the United Nations,
and the agreement under A which
Australia became the sole adminis-
tering authority was approved by
the General Assembly of the United
Nations on Dec. 13, 1946. It is
administered conjointly with the
Territory of Papua.
The Trust Territory includes:
(1) North-eastern New Guinea,
which includes the adjacent islands
of Manam, Karkar, Long, Bagab'ag,
Schouten and Kairiru; (2) Bis-
marck Archipelago, including New
Britain, New Ireland and islands
adjacent to both; (3) Admiralty
Islands; (4) the two northernmost
Solomon Islands, Bougainville and
Buka, with adjacent islands.
Brief Answers
T.W.: Pichi Richi Pass is a gap
in the Flinders Ranges between
Port Augusta and Quorn (S.A.),
through which the Central Aus-
tralia railway-line to Alice Springs
used to pass. It was discovered
in 1843 by William Pinkerton, the
first settler in the Quorn district,
and it became an important outlet
for the transport of wool to Port
Augusta for shipment. A small
town grew-up at a staging-point
near the top of the pass, but when
the railway was put through in
1879 its function disappeared and
it soon became a “ghost town”....
M.S.: The first direct use of power
from the Snowy was probably in
sluicing operations on the Kiandra
goldfield in 1860. Small dams
were built on many streams, and
systems of canals called “races,”
sometimes several miles in length,
conveyed the water to points above
the workings. Here it passed into
canvas hoses under pressure and
emerged as jets which were used
for cutting away overburden and
washing the gold-bearing gravel.
Hydroelectric power first came
under investigation in 1915-20
when the Public Works Depart-
ment of N.S.W. considered generat-
ing electricity by diverting the
Snowy across the neck of its
80-mile loop south of Jindabyne.
W.H.: The simplest method
to cover worn patches on an enamel
bath is to apply a liquid bath-
enamel, available at a paint or
hardware store. Clean and dry
the bath thoroughly before com-
mencing and smooth the edges of
the patches with fine glasspaper.
Two or three coats will give a
good finish; it will not be as good
as new, but it will stand considerable
wear, and can be renewed....
R.G.: Tokyo is the only city in
the world with a population ex-
ceeding 9,000,000. London is the
next most populous. There are
seven Chinese cities with a popu-
lation of more than 1,000,000....

assembling the programme he
has balanced voices, moods and
subjects. It was a good touch
to throw-in balladry here and
there, as when Stan Arthur
sings “The Wild Colonial

the rumbustious “One Eyed

for making Poems and Songs

The Beethoven Fourth
Those who like the master
in his more genial moods,
when he is not engaged in
Olympian soul-struggles with
a malignant fate, should find
the four even-numbered sym-
phonies right to their liking,
and the Fourth as unre-
servedly joyous as any he wrote.
Schumann aptly described this
one as “a slender Greek maiden
between two Norse giants.”
Agreeable melodies, lush har-
monies and tripping, nimble
rhythms sparkling with gaiety
are on offer —and these are
most deftly worked-out in a
reading by Ernest Ansermet
conducting the Suisse
Romande Orchestra. The last
band of this Symphony No. 4
in B Flat Major, a Decca
record (LXTA 5507) is re-
served for the same composer’s
Overture to “Coriolan.”

Master and Pupil
Cesar Franck and his star
pupil, Vincent D’lndy, share a
disk from Coronet, and the
honors go close to even. In
Franck’s Symphonic Varia-
tions (KLC 2705) Robert
Casadesus gives a crisp and
at times dynamic account of
the keyboard part, with
Ormandy keeping a tight check
on the Philadelphia Orchestra.
This famous piece, a hybrid,
part symphony, part piano-
concerto and part Set of varia-
tions, is eminently listenable.
D’lndy’s Symphony On a
French Mountain Air also uses
the piano, and it is steeped in
nature a lovely, serenely
flowing evocation of the
pastoral scene and distant
mountain - tops. A charming
feature is the togetherness of
harp and piano.

Camden Encores
With its admirable policy of
issuing, under its Camden
series, singing-albums of
world-famous artists culled
from recordings made in their
prime, R.C.A. does a fine ser-
vice for lovers of high-class
song. Following its Gigli
album, already reviewed here,
come two more. One is
Geraldine Farrar in Carmen
(CAM 32). The beautiful
Geraldine is considered the
greatest of the Carmens to
have appeared at the Met.,
and here, where she sings all
the chief arias and duets with
Martinelli (the “golden-
voiced”) and baritone Pasquale
Amato, she piles-up plenty of
aural testimony to the claim.
Certainly no purer mezzo-
soprano has been committed
to the micro-tracks. In the
other, Ezio Pinza Sings
Italian Songs (CAM 34), the
great basso has produced a
real collector’s piece—12 arias
from 17th- and 18th-century
operas, from Monteverdi and
Falconierei to Scarlatti and
Paisello. Pinza’s flawless artis-
try allied to the richest bass
since Chaliapin make this
record one long delight.

Chopin Album
The old saying that it takes
a Pole to play Chopin really
well has had a lot of dents
put in it in recent times,
notably by such virtuosi as
Solomon and Arrau; but
here’s one of Chopin’s com-
patriots who could certainly
lend weight to the original
contention. In Chopin, Im-
mortal Masterpieces, on a
Philips Gold Label platter
(GL 14), Adam Harasiewicz
(or sounds to that effect) has
put together the Fantaisie in F
Minor, a major piece exceeded
only in scope by the three
sonatas and the two concertos ;
two G Flat Major Etudes,
including the “Black Keys”;
the first and fourth Scherzi; the
C Sharp Minor Polonaise, and
two Mazurkas the post-
humous A Minor and the No.
17 altogether an enchant-
ing 40 minutes of poetry in
pianism.

delicate blossoms of fashion are mostly
white though some are pastel, and their
w is soft and supple. The hats are

will themselves blossom with the spring

It was the opportunity to gaze on the
Paris hats as much as anything else that
brought nearly 200 people to the Rose
Bay home of the John Coghlans on Wed-
nesday night, though the charm of the
setting, high on the hill above the Harbor,
and the fact that the affair was in aid of
lire Royal Blind Society through the
Black and White Ball Committee, also
acted as magnets. The champagne was
nice, too.
henriette Lamotte showed the hats,
frothy confections of folded organdie,
shaded tulle and Italian straws light as
thistledown. Most of the crowns were
high and narrow, the brims deep and
sloping (one hat in cinnamon straw
resembled a pagoda). These were for the
* girls, but small toques and up-turned
Bretons (one in white guipure with black
i ns was particularly enchanting)

“The Woman’s Budget” and of the
Sydney “Sun,” and until last year she
was active as a social-reporter for a
firm of photographers. She retired from
work at the age of 91 —surely a record
in the journalistic world. Miss Marlay
(Mrs. Beeby in private life) was
the grand-daughter of Major W. H. B.
Marlay, an English officer who saw
distinguished service in the Peninsula
Wars and came to Sydney as Barrack
Master in 1837.

Side-thoughts on Education Week
include the reflection that school seems
to be much more popular now than it
did a generation ago. There is very
little of the “creeping like snail un-
willingly to school,” and the end of the
holidays is often welcomed just as much
by the youngsters as it is by the parents.
There’s more activity, color and drama
in schoolwork today, which no doubt
accounts for its added attractiveness.
However, from the teacher’s point of
view, things have deteriorated in one
respect, and that is in the size of classes.
Although it is considered by authorities
all over the world that 30 is the maxi-
mum number that any one teacher can
handle adequately, it is not uncommon
for as many as 60 to form a class.
Official figures show that in the first three
years of secondary-schooling (this refers
to the State schools) 57 per cent, are in
classes of 40 or more, and 27,000 students
in classes numbering between 45 and 55.
Television may be the answer to this
problem, for a lesson projected from
a TV-set to a wide screen can be viewed
by as many as 100 students, and the
teacher left free to devote himself to
supervision and correction. This method
is used, one hears, in England to some
extent, and the results are encouraging.
School-uniforms —whether they should
be compulsory or not —is another side-
issue that comes up for discussion at this
time. In America 95 per cent, of school-
girls dress as their mothers think fit, and
there is intense competition among the
girls as to who shall be considered the
smartest. In Australia the same percent-
age wear uniforms, though some mothers
boggle at the cost. Perhaps the cost
would be even higher if little Sandra had
to compete with Wendy’s new fur-coat or
Elizabeth’s mohair-jacket.
A well-known headmistress said
recently that she thought the three-pleat
tunic “perfectly hideous,” and apparently
those who have made cotton dresses the
school-uniform agree with her. But the
tunic has its points. By its classic line
it lends form and dignity to the schoolgirl-
figure, which is inclined to be variable,
and it also identifies its wearer as a
schoolgirl, something that she may not
always wish (though she generally does)
but which is a protection to her. The
only time the tunic-and-blazer seems
unsuitable is when worn by tiny little girls
just beginning school. With their velor
hats, their gloves, their stout shoes, their
school-cases, five- and six-year-olds often
look quite overburdened by their weight
of uniformity.

Watch out for wigs! There is news
from the U.S. that women there are wear-
ing wigs' fashioned like the hair-do of
Mrs. Richard Nixon and of Mrs. John
Kennedy, according to their political
affiliations, and already the Sydney scene
displays a striking hair-do that its owner
admits is a wig. At a hat-show during
the week Mrs. Marjorie Lewin wore a
bouffant style of azure-blue hair especially
made-up for her by the local hairdresser.
Well, wigs would be nice and warm this
weather, at least.


“the well-known grower of Gog-
Magogs”—a phrase which, perhaps be-
cause Gog-Magogs are a vegetable,
irresistibly brings to mind Finglebury
Flying-fox, “the well-known and
respected fruit-stealer,” in “The Magic
Pudding.”
Again, it is not surprising in Powys,
though it would be ih anyone else, to
find that the novel is largely about
Bubble and Squeak, Bubble being a
fountain that, in some mysterious Eng-
lish cavern, continually makes bubbles
which burst, and Squeak being the skull
of the first man on earth, also inhabit-
ing the cavern. Whenever the Bubble
bursts Squeak defiantly squeaks.
Squeak is capable of rational conver-
sation with visitors, and both he and
Bubble are able to assume sufficient
identity and shape to take-off with John
o’ Dreams, and a Cyclops, for a space-
flight to the sun.
Bubble and Squeak prove, in
Powys’s indomitable mysticism, that if
Everything is Nothing, continually
bursting, nevertheless it is also Every-
thing, immortally squeaking: “All is not
Nothing, neither is Nothing All, but
both of them have one home-star,
where they can sink to eternal
quiescence, or mount to everlasting
activity, and that home-star, my
children, is the heart in every one of
us.” This may (or may not) have been
what Robert D. Fitz Gerald was saying
in that haunting and equally mysteri-
ous poem, “The Face of the Waters.”
It is a little surprising, however, to
find Powys, who has had a peculiar
quarrel with the sun ever since “A
Glastonbury Romance,” visiting that
orb in this novel, though it must be
said that he still maintains his hos-
tility; and it is more surprising still,
since hitherto the wildest creatures of
his imagination have been earth-born,
to find him meeting, elsewhere in space,
such creatures as the whiffin:—
“It” is the only living creature we
know who inhabits Empty Space. Its
body is completely round and is
covered by a thin, wiry, flexible,
impenetrable, indestructible skin. It
has only one eye, which, along with
its mouth, protrudes some distance
from its body at the end of a tube-
like erection. Its mouth is divided
from its eye by several inches of a
scaly substance . . . supporting its
curious wings.
The characteristic of Powys’s novels,
since he left his sumptuous world of
lustful peasants to rove into history
and allegory, has been an extraordinary
unreality. His characters are as fanci-
ful as Shelley’s personifications (which
he mentions with approval in the pre-
sent novel) and you just do not feel
that any of the story is really happen-
ing, on any level of credibility. “Homer
and the Aether,” which was very highly
praised, may have been an exception;
as in its earthier parts is “All or
Nothing.”
But here, too, in the more imagina-
tive sections, Powys makes no attempt
to be convincing. Instead of inventing
some suitable rocket to take his adven-
turers to the sun, as all the best science-
fictioneers do, he simply swoops them
up there mystically, damping the sun’s
heat by thunderstorms called up by the
Bubble; and when he drops John o’
Dreams to earth again, with his arms
clasped round the hips of a personified
falling-star, we are truly in the airy
realms of Shelley; into which, when
the star is sleeping the night with John’s
family, and John with lewd rapture
stares entranced upon her naked
bottom, obtrudes an earthiness of
vision which Shelley would have found
extremely surprising.
Obviously, then, it is impossible to
read this novel as science-fiction or any
kind of faintly-credible fantasy. When
you meet such people as the Worm-
man and the Slug-woman, or the dream
named Lorm which has two fronts, one
a man and one a woman, it can cer-
tainly be read for its queerness; but
essentially it is a dramatisation, or
personification, of Powys’s metaphysi-
cal ideas; and as such, on the tremend-
ous question of whether “the immensity
of space.... can have a soul” it is as
searching as it is odd. It is a good deal
shorter than most of his recent novels,
and, in consequence, so much the more
approachable.
New Zealand Novel
It seems that the New Zealand
novelist lan Cross is about to repeat
the amazing success of his first novel
“The God Boy” with his second, The
Backward Sex, just published in
London by Andre Deutsch.
In this novel, the Penguin rights of
which have already been sold, lan
Cross has added four years to his “God
Boy,” changed the name of his hero
from Jimmy to Robbie and substituted
Eros for God. The transition has
been magically achieved. We still have
the quaint unpredictable boy and his
fits of violence, but he has now entered
the fearsome forest of adolescence.
There is a kind of a blood-pact between
Robbie and his mate Harry; each must
come to the rescue of the other even to
the extent of potential murder.
I asked Cross why, seeing he was
such a peaceful bloke himself, should
he be so immersed in violence in his
books. Cross smiled in his peaceful
manner and remarked, “Anyhow, it
doesn’t come to anything in the end.”
Admittedly; but in his encounters with
Mrs. Ranier, the woman in the case,
Robbie comes near to murdering her
if only in an all-in wrestling match,
extended almost to burlesque, in her
bedroom.
Certainly the charm of Mrs. Ranier
is of the inflammatory o rrW ,

About the one exception to this flow of

which is all sweet, maybe because, in
his reverence for the brave and simple

about Eastman. The description of
Dewey in his old age in his summer
home at Key West makes it almost cer-
tain that Dewey was the model for the
professor of languages in Hemingway’s

been held in such respect by both
Hemingway and Eastman—he must
have been quite a man.
NOTES IN PENCIL
Sea touches land where . . .
and the newly-sharpened pencil
snaps at a too-finely-razored
tip, making a scumble
of graphic grains. One intended
tracing the longest reach
of a breaking wave, noticing
how like a mantle it is
extended from a scallop shell
deliberately, purposefully, delicately
up the camber of the sand
and then withdrawn.
One would have recorded a
fine fringe of sea mucous thin
as a strand of flotsam thread.
But this blunted stub
serves better as a rod now
to probe a knot of sun-dried weed
releasing a spray of sandhoppers
that pepper hands, face
with pellets of sensation.
Notice also how these newly dead
shells trickle a little
golden treasure into one's palm.

Durrell’s Quartet
Lawrence Durrell’s Clea (Faber) is
the concluding volume of a quartet of
novels including “Justine,” “Bal-
thazar” and “Mountolive.” The earlier
books are set in Alexandria before the
Second World War; “Clea” during it.
“Clea” cannot satisfactorily be read
by itself. Each preceding novel ampli-
fied the situation, displayed new plots,
showed the main characters in various
aspects and carried the story forward,
sideways and upsidedown as it were.
Even with “Clea,” as the author indi-
cates, the process is not finished.
To such a large canvas with so many
rich, strange, active and talkative
characters there can be no real end.
Superficially one could think of com-
parisons with, say, Joyce Cary’s
trilogies, but actually the differences
are both of kind and design, and
whereas one can, for instance, read
“To Be a Pilgrim” with great enjoy-
ment and in ignorance of “Herself
Surprised” or “The Horse’s Mouth,”
this is not so with Durrell’s quartet.
Because none of the four novels is
especially long a plea could be made
for the return of the long, multi-volume
novel, but it might not really be justi-
fied, for the quartet does not essentially
have the entity of a longer Dickens
book, or a Balzac or Tolstoy work.
As far as the contents of his books
are concerned, Durrell is of the school
that eschews “normality,” seeking to
display our condition in the highly-
colored persons of larger-than-life
characters, usually both constructing
and acting within their own logic. If
he has not entirely succeeded—and,
indeed, given such scope, success could
probably only be relative—this quartet
is certainly a very considerable attempt.
One should stress, too, that although
not absolutely “easy to read,” his prose
is only difficult because it strives for
exactness, and the novels are immensely
entertaining at any level, even the most
superficial level of strong plot, sizzling
sex and good salting of bawdy ... the
last so cunningly introduced that the
more corrupt you already are the more
you will discover. No censor need fear
for the morals of the still-innocent.
