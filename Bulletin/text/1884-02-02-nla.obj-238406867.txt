Freedom and Its Friends.
The S M. Hehald, as the organ of wealth,
is in high jubilation over the lecture by Ur.
Gippen, to which reference has before been
made in these columns. The feat performed
by this lecturer was to “prove” from sta-
tistics that the artizan in Great Britain is
greatly better off than he was a score of
years ago, and the inferences which his com-
mentator invite people to accept are no
less sweeping than that it is untrue that the
rich are becoming richer and the poor
poorer. In short, that the tendency of
modern times is not to increasingly concen-
trate wealth in the hands of the few. Ur.
Gifpen’s little juggle with figures can have
so feeble an effect when brought in conliict
■ with universal observation and experience,
and more particularly with the logical de-
monstrations of the profoundest thinkers
and most impartially careful observers of
the age, that it would scarcely be worthy of
notice had not the organs of monopoly been
so much enraptured to find that anything
can be said on their side that they have
trumpeted the lecture as though it con-
tained a new gospel. The comments of
such organs are, however, sometimes so
diverting as to furnish suitable matter for the
entertainment of reasonable people. Accord-
ing to the sense of the arguments now used,
it would seem that people are expected to
believe that perfection has been attained in
the adjustment of social arrangements.
They are free to admit that those who pro-
pounded a similar theory a score or so of
years ago were mistaken. But, consequent
on changes then denounced as bitterly as
they now denounced further propositions
for change, everything has been put to
rights, and it is sheer wickedness to pretend
the contrary. Thus the S.M. Hereld blinks
with a sort of approval on trades-unionism,
which it adduces as one of the influences
which has wrought improvement in the con-
dition of the artizan class. And the same
authority is quite apologetic for the abolition
of the (Joru laws whioh cheapened food for
the millions. “ Legislation ” the Herald re-
gards as another of the causes of the alleged
improvement in the artizans’ condition —
that is to say, post legislation. Future legisla-
tion is, of course, a matter to be deprecated,
since perfection has been attained; or, at any
rate, future legislation which would be satis-
factory to those abominable persons—advo-
cates for change. That is to say, future
legislation which would accomplish anything
at all except retrogression.
• . •
All this amounts to little more than
an unintentional confessions that the
hetrodoxy of yesterday is the orthodoxy
of to-day. Forty years ago, trade--
unionism, one of the influences now
alleged to have improved the condition of
the mechanical class, was not merely de-
nounced in the most furious way by all
respectable people and writers —was not
merely scoffed at as visionary, and preached
at as contrary to the dispensations of
1 rovidence—but was referred to in precisely
the same vein and spirit as more recent
Projects of social reform and re-adjustment
are scouted to-day by such papers as the
S.M. Herald. And the agitators for the
repeal of the Corn laws were assailed with
the same virulence of misrepresentation
and abhorrence, and were held up to
detestation in precisely the same style,
and for precisely the same sort of as-
pirations and principles as are to-day
social reformers —whose very designa-
tions, Socialists and Communists, have
been made terms of reproach and
obloquy. Forty years ago, trades-union did
not merely expose its participants to obloquy
and denunciations. It was not simply “ bad
form ” and infamous. It was absolutely on
the same footing with conspiracy to de-
fraud. It was illegal for operatives to com-
bine, and constituted a criminal offence.
And, as regards the Corn laws, although it
was not actually a statutable offence to
agitate for their abolition, it was regarded
as equally outrageous. So outrageous, in
fact, that it was universally held among the
fortunate classes that it should bespecia'ly
legislated against, and made a criminal pro-
ceeding. We are not writing at random.
Here is what John Morluy records in his
“ Life of Richard Cobden ” :—
“In England, it is certain that the
vigour and resolution of the (anti-Corn - law)
League were regarded with intense disfavour by
great and important classes. The League was
thoroughly out of fashion. It was regarded as
violent, extreme, and not respectable. A year
before it had usually been described as a self-
sh and contemptible faction. By the end
of 1843, things had become more serious. The
notorious pamphleteer of the Quarterly Re-
view now denounced the League as the foulest
and piost dangerous combination of modern times
The Times spoke of Cobden, Bright, and the!
allies as ‘capering mercenaries who go frisking
about the country;’ as authors of incendiary clap-
trap ; as peripatetic orators puffing themselves
into easy popularity by second-hand arguments.
They were constantly accused of retarding their
own cause, and frightening away respectable
people, by their violence. Violence, ts usual,
meant nothing more than that they knew their
own minds and pressed their convictions as if
they were in earnest. . . . There were loud
threats of criminal proceedings against the ob-
noxious confederacy.”
Now, this is obviously identical with the
sort of language now employed with refer-
ence to the Social Reformers of to-day. The
terms “Socialistic” and “Communistic”
were not current in 1843, or they would cer-
tainly have been availed of in the vocabu-
lary of abuse.
The abolition of the Corn laws was ef-
fected, and the evils fortold as certain to fol-
low the change did not follow. The landed
proprietors suffered in their pockets, cer-
tainly, but the nation benefited. And Cob-
den and Bright, from being scouted as in-
cendiaries, are now among the patron saints
even of people who apply to their successors
in the work of jirogressive social reforms
all the the terms of abuse, denunciation
and scorn, once heaped upon them. The S.
M. Herald for example, justifies their
work. In a queer, contradictory fashion, it
is true, but still it justifies them. “The
Free-trade legislation (the abolition of the
Corn laws) was,” said the Herald, only last
week, “obviously no interference between
classes, but only the removal of an interfer-
ence; it set things free, and left them to
take their course, and the result has been an
enormous gain to all but a section of rura
landlords,” As a matter of fae‘, this ex-
cuse, or extenuation, or justification is not
valid. It'ienios the essential fact, and tries to
veil the denial by a representation minimis-
ing the extent to which social arrange-
ments were affected by the abolition in
the Corn laws. “It was no interference be-
tween classes,” quoth the 8. M. Herald, but,
as a matter of fact, it was not merely “a
section of rural landlords” who were
affected Every landlord in England who
owned arableland was concerned Theentire
body of English landlords resisted the
change. It was, at the lime, especially
denounced as an interference between
| classes. And such it undoubtedly was. The
i great populous manufacturing centres,
i led by the great mill-owners, and ulti-
mately supported by the people as a body,
went straight at the pockets of landlordism,
That the success of the abolition party was
merely “the removal of an interference’’
was true, although such an explanation
would have been vehemently denied by
the landlord party at the time. Ami
that plea is precisely the plea which
is advanced by the Social reformers of to-
day. The whole spirit of Henry George’s
work, of Mill on “ Unearned Increment,’’
andof Alfred Wallaceou “.Nationalization
of Laud,” breathes the same argument. The
existing social arrangements, they say, are
artificial and unnatural. They are main-
tained by forcible or fraudulent inter-
ferences with the order of nature. It is
unnatural, they assert, that but about one.
million of the people of Great Britain should
live in that country on suffranoe, liable to
I be ejected from the British Isles altogether
unless they paid some landlord or other, in
some fashion, for leave to tread on British
soil. They say that only interferences with
natural law could have created a condition
of affairs which renders it possible for almost
the entire British people to be condemned
—legally condemned, remember—as tres-
| passers, if they refused to pay rent, or tribute
; income indirect form, to the comparative
i handful who own the country.
• « «
“It is to new laws,” quoth the Herald
“that the Socialist party trust most to pro-
mote the good of the people.” This is a half
truth. It is rather to the abrogation of old
laws which Social reformers look—the ab-
rogation of laws which have been demon-
strated to create or foster “interferences”
between classes. Laws framed specially to
perpetuate the | divisions of classes — to
maintain the rich in tjieir wealth fot*
generation after generation. “Laws for
the proper protection of property,” these
are euphemistically termed. The Herald
| announces further that the reformers’
greatest abhorrence seems to be freedom j
and that they look upon laissez-faire as the
root of all evil. Look upon “let-a-be” as
the root of all evil. Certainly, the reform-
ing party look upon existing conditions as
infamous, and condemned by their results--
such results as are disclosed in the “Bitter
Cry of Outcast London,” and they would
be false indeed to their convictions did they
not regard laissez-faire as impossible. But
they do not look upon it as the root of the
evil. The root is not traceable in laissez-
faire. There was ample activity in the self-
ishness which arranged affairs so that all
the advantage should be secured to the few
Laissez-faire —to let things continue as they
are—why, even the S. M. Herald dare not
advocate that in a straightforward way. Is
the “bitter cry” not only of outcast Lon-
don, but of the outcast majority of man-
kind to rise to Heaven for ever, and to ap-
peal to the Al»ighty’s ear against the
injustice of human laws and selfishness for
ever, and in vain ?

when accusing Social reformers of hating
liberty. “ Factory legislation,” says the
Herald, “has undoubtedly been a restraint
on individual liberty, and it has checked the
cupidity of both classes alike. It has pre-
vented women and children from selling
their labour to an undue extent, and has
prevented employers from buying it. Both
were only too willing to trade, and there
has been a social gain in limiting that
trade.” “Both were only too willing to
trade!” Good heavens! On even terms!
The employer was only too willing to
buy flesh and blood cheap—true. And
flesh and blood was willing to sell
itself cheap! — not true. What alterna-
tive had flesh and blood in the mat-
ter ? Were parents anxious to see their
little ones to a drudgery worse than that
exacted from Negro slaves! Were the in-
fanta whom these Molochs, the factories,
devoured, willing to be devoured? Well,
yes; willing, lest a worse thing should befal
them. Willing to accept anything rather
than starve. This choice is often grimly
alluded to by the 8.M. Herald as the “ free-
dom of contract.” And it is freedom of
this kind which the Social reformer de-
nounces—no other. A villainous burlesque
of Freedom. Freedom of contract presup-
poses equality of conditions. That is not
freedom which places one body of bargainers
under the tremendous pressure of a social
system which leaves him the option of ac-
cepting any offer made to him, or being
plunged—instantly plunged—into the fright-
ful sufferings of absolute want. It is this
travesty of Freedom which Social reformers
detest and assail. Freedom itself — true
Freedom—is what it labours and braves
obloquy and misrepresentation to secure
for the down-trodden majority of groaning
humanity.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Two “Medical Gentlemen.”
The Chinese are ingenious in everything—even in
their punishments. Sometimes a notorious offen-
der is deprived of life by being deprived of sleep.
Guards are told off to keep him on the move by
means of pins, nails, thorns, and spear-points,
when ho shows a disposition to lie down. By this
and kindred moans be is sometimes kept alive for
eight or nine days, until exhausted nature comes
to his relief, and death puts an end to bis torments.
There is a family resemblance between this refine-
ment of barbarism and that suggested by two
“ medical gentlemen ” who, the Australasian
Medical Gazette Informs us, attended the late
floggings at Woolloomooloo “ from professional
reasons.” These worthies consider that the pun-
ishment was got over too quickly, and that the
administering of twenty-five lashes in loss than
three minutes did not inflict sufficient pain on the
culprits. To avoid in future such a leaning to-
wards mawkish sensibility, they propose that there
should bo an interval of thirty seconds between
each stroke, so that the correction “ would be un-
utterably more severe, without causing any more
injury to the man flogged, and with less shock to
the nervous system.” But their suggestion does
not end here. They complain that “ the lashes are
administered too much on one spot,” and should
be more Impartially distributed, so that no portion
of the dorsal region could reasonably complain of
being neglected. Even this does not exhaust their
Ingenuity. Half the number of stripes should be
apportioned to tho buttocks, “so that for tho
next fortnight or so the men flogged would be
in such a state as to prefer standing to sitting.”
They compare tho leniency of the larrikins’ whip-
ping, where blood was drawn in one case only, and
that but slightly, with the severity of naval and
military punishments, where “it generally ran
pretty freely.” Pretty freely it did run, indeed I
We have seen it running in and out of a man’s
boots as he stood at the triangles, while tho young
“sawbones” who had just blundered through his
course at Edinburgh or Dublin felt the wretched
fellow’s pulse to see if the extreme limit of
endurance had been reached, or whether another
dozen or so could be safely worked in. Let us see
what would result now, and what would have re-
sulted in times happily gone by, from the adoption
of these “ medical gentlemen’s " views. A larrikin
sentenced to BO stripes—allowing for five minutes
spent in getting ready that portion of his frame
whose flaying would induce him to prefer
“standing to sitting’’—would spend just half an
hour at the halberds. Soldiers who had to undergo
BOO, and occasionally800, would have had to remain
there from four and a half to seven hours ! It is
when we remember this that we feel a burning
desire to know more of tUe two “ medical gentle-
men” who recommend the half-minute interval,
and the more equal distribution “over the dorsal
and other regions.” And, now that the Army and
Navy have been mentioned, we shall give a little
of our experience of Army medical officers. We
know dozens of surgeons, both staff and regimen-
tal. There were some humane men amongst them,
but they were generally looked upon as milk-sops.
It may, of course, be said that the profession of
a surgeon is the one of all others best calculated
to blunt all the finer feelings and harden men
to suffering—in others. Still, making due allow-
ance for this, it was notorious that If “ professional
advice ” could have preserved the life of the Army
“cat,” that animal would be now as vigorous and
biting as in the worst days of the Crimea. The
last soldier flogged in England died in the regi-
mental hospital a couple of days afterwards. The
“doctor’s ” certificate assigned the death to some
obscure disease with a nice Latin name, but said
nothing about the punishment. We know what
English juries are—how they sometimes get their
backs up and ask all sorts of ill-bred questions.
So, in spite o' - > he “ medical gentleman’s ” opinion,
they, in th„ . .. undering fashion, bracketed the
whipping and the death as cause and effect. Mr.
Gladstone was of the same way of thinking, and
so the “ cat ” was thrown into the well, where tho
“picket,” the “pitch cap,” and the other devices
used by tho men who surrendered at York Town,
or ordered a disastrous retreat in Holland, lay
burled. Brutality and cowardice do not always
run in couples, but there are some close family
ties between them. In the service, we have often
noticed that tho kind of gentlemen to whom those
belong who a<-e anxious for “ thirty seconds’ in-
terval between each stroke,” were equally anxious
for a few thousand yards’ interval between them-
selves and the place whore, the fire being hottest,
they were most required. Plenty of humane men
in N.S. Wales and Victoria consider—they have a
perfect right to their opinion—that lawless bru-
tality must be met by legal brutality. But, so far,
we have not come across any to whisper such a
refinement of cruelty as the two “ medical gentle-
men” who, “from professional reasons,” stood
beside the triangles at Woolloomooloo to hear the
howls of the larrikins and regret that they were
not deeper and more protracted.
Those Essays.
Earl Rosebery has given a cheque of 50 guineas
for two prize English essays to be written by
graduates and nuder-graduates of the Sydney
University. The subjects are “.The Future (cap.
F) of the Australian Colonies,” and “The Growth
of the Australian Colonies, and their present Rela-
tion to the Mother Country.” It is bad form to
Inspect the mouth of a horse which reaches you ns
a gift, but, in this case, wo fancy we could see a
better way of turning this 50-guinea cheque to
advantage than by extracting sundry reams of
callow gush from a number of young gentlemen
whose intellectual outfit by present University
training consists in a memory stuffed with bald
grammatical and mathematical formulae. Had it
been a treatise, now, on the classiflcation of
irregular verbs, or un inquiry into the com-
missariat arrangement of Xerxes, or any other
subject of high discussion, we might ex-
pect a little eloquence. But an essay in the
barbarous English tongue, and on so common-
place a subject as the dusty world we live in—it’s
asking rather much. Why, if encouragement is
given to the practice of English prose, and the
study of contemporary history, we shall soon be
without a man capable of giving the date of the
First Punic War, or tho allocation of Troy, or
some other matter of grave import. Worse still,
wo shall lose our annual treat of Latin verse,
whilst the B.A.’s will have their heads turned with
vanity and be competing with the reporters
in the occult and lucrative art of describing how
a horse “attached to a spring cart” bolted,
etc. Wo claim no small credit from mem-
bers of tho craft in calling early attention
to this insidious attempt to get more spoons
into our paste-pot. Already wo have received
more than one bundle of neatly-ruled foolscap,
covered with excruciatingly funny things about
the University, and only that the grammar is so un-
mistakably academic in its independence of all
known rules, and the point of the jokes are ex-
plained by algebraic equations requiring special
type, there 1s no knowing but some of it might
have escaped the waste-basket in the temporary
absence of tho editor. For what the public, how-
ever, have escaped, through our vigilance, we
expect no reward. But we don’t want to know
what Mr. Gerund x. Pluck (Act 20) thinks of
problems that gravel Gladstone and Lord Derby.
Hallucinations.
Public opinion la Melbourne has set itself to put
down prostitution and intemperance. The me-
thods adopted are particularly simple. It is always
so when the light of a great genius shines upon a
course. Every other town of civilization can now
take heart of grace. It will be only necessary to
choke off Herbert Spencer, to throw a brick at
Henry George, to bury the axioms of Stuart
Mill, to burn the memory of Mat.thus, and to
come out and study the process by which wise
Melbourne has cleansed souls and scattered the
clouds from brains— when wise Melbourne has ac-
complished these things. Then every town will
be happy, and will go to bed and rise up in an
atmosphere charged with the steaming odours of
sanctity. Many distinguished persons have visited
the antipodes lately, and we have reason for be-
lieving that under the pretext of making a tour
they came here purposely to learn the Melbourne
way of suppressing the two deadliest of tho world’s
evils. On the question of prostitution, Melbourne
is all there. It sees its way in a twinkle. It used
to be a vexing subject long ago. Economists and
humanitarians grew grey over it, and had to leave
it much as it was. But they didn’t try the Mel-
bou rne way. The “superior vigour of the Southern
colony” had not tackled It. It has tackled it
now. It is rooting the evil out. Soon we shall be
wondering what it was the thinkers from tho middle
ages forward were puzzled about; but in justice to
those old men we ought to remember that “tho
superior vigour of the Southern colony” was not
in an active state at that time. Do you want to
supprets prostitution? Very well. Here’s the
Melbourne way: Hunt the girls and women out of
their abodes; when they go elsewhere, hunt them
out again ; act consistently, and keep on hunting
them; and it stands to reason you will get rid of
them, or kill them, very soon; and do the same
with their successors, and keep getting rid of
them or killing them all the time. Drabbled skirts
are on the streets there, now. They have been
hunted from front street to back street, from
parlour to kitchen, from cellar to garret. They
have no roof now to shelter them. The sky,
following tho usual practice with persecuted un
fortunates, has just taken these days to open it
floodgates. The drabbled creatures fly from
streets to gardens and open roadways, and still the
hunt is kept up. It is said that now comes the
time when other measures are to be brought to
bear. Any reason, except a Melbourne one, would
think the other measure should have been taken
first. Taken now, what measures can result in
anything but failure? The dirty pool has been
st irred. Thexnud has been set swimming on the top,
W ho is so blind as not to see that there exists no
agency to keep it from sinking again to the
bottom? Misery has been added to misery.
Fright and terror and outrage and shame have
been superimposed on weakness and misfortune.
Tliat’s all. And, in combating tho demon of
drink, Melbourne is just as biilliant as in the
matter of prostitution. Booth and his apostles
are at a premium there now. There’s nothing
keeps down intemperance like a bit of blue rib-
bon. Mount it, and get on a platform, and bo
always ready to describe minutely how you used
to murder and thieve when you were a sot. The
moral level attained by the community in tha*
way will be very high. Some people may think
'that this is the way to make a community of
arrant humbugs, of canting, ranting, posturing
showmen. But why mind these people ? We saw
a rat in a cage once. A brutal fellow poked a red
hot poker into the cage. The rat only saw the
poker and worried it. The problem of life has
thrust prostitution and drunkenness Into the cage
of Melbourne existence. Melbourne worries the
two with red-hot pokers. But the brutal problem
is there, laughing all the time.
The call of a benevolent asylum is generally
potent to loosen the purse-strings of the well-to-
do. The Coppin Amat:ur Dramatic Club gave an
entertainment recently for the Melbourne institu-
tion. It was given in the institution, and 187 of tho
aged people were present. 107 visitors rolled up,
carrying their cheque-books with them, and
prepared to respond generously to the charitable
appeal. The club worked with energy, and when
they had wiped away tho perspiration, sat down
to count the contents of the collection boxes. But
the contents came to only £2 11s. 3d., with a bad
sixpence. And these visitors had gone up to that
institution with expressions of the deepest sym-
pathy for the poor old men and women who had
gone to the wall in tho battle of life !
Mr. James Mirams.
Mi rams is a paradox, in so far as he is at once a
great and small man. This is explained as indi-
cating that wbile his smallness relates to his physi-
cal stature, his greatness is shown in his moral and
intellectual height. It has been said that Nature
originally intended Mirams for Tom Thumb. But
Mr. Stratton anticipated the revelation; so that,
thus thwarted. Nature left Mirams half way, and
so neglected him that he grew to be too big for a
show dwarf, and too small for a society man.
Determined, however, to make a name despite his
disabilities of stature, Mirams studied politics,
and building societies, and the theory of paper
money, and the temperance cause, and the land
question. On all of these matters he became an
authority: not because his views were necessarily
sound, but because they were eccentric. Mirams
is shrewd; Mira i s is wise in his knowledge of
human nature. Knowing that all that was
needed was to take up a startling position, in
direct variance to any maintained by other
men, he set forth advanced views, with the
result that he secured attention. The dodge
is as old as Ezekiel and the prophets, but is always
successful. And so we find Mirams at once laughed
at and applauded, and a pow er in the House of
which he is a member. Mirams represents the
savoury constituency of Colllngwood. His views,
therefore, may be supposed to be of the radical
order. When the great Berry led the country by
the nose with alternate “burning questions,”
little Mirams was his faithful henchman. Armed
with his leviathan umbrella, he accompanied his
chief upon all his stump excursions, and was ever
ready to back that gentleman’s utterances with
an echo. Little did Mirams then dream that the
great man he worshipped was as fickle as a woman
and ns treacherous as a Solomon Islander. Little
did it enter into tho pigmy’s honest thought that
Berry could and would throw him over, as soon as
it was convenient. Vet so it was. Ministry after
Ministry was formed by the groat guerilla chief,
but Mirams entered not into their composition.
He mourned, did Mirams, and murmured, but still
held fast to his faith. At last, however, the scales
fell from his eyes. Mr. Graham Berry shuffled
out of the Liberal camp. No more did he utter
those vehement revolutionary orat ions which at
one time had stirred the blood of the great com-
munity. He compromised—was silent—discarded
burning questions, and finally' took office as a
coalition Minister with Jemmy Service. This
was a blow, indeed, to Mirams. But ho
rallied, and now sits on the cross-benches, whence
he hurls, at every chance, such bitter jibes at his
old chief as make that honest gentleman squirm
again. Still, there would appear to be a certain
reserved force in Mirams when satirising his old
friend. Once or twice he has gone beyond the
borderland, and has begun to toll tales, when he
has been speedily checked by the offer, on Mr,
Berry’s part, to turn informer also. Thus, you
see, Mirams has been imprudent, and has
done and said things in the secret past which
were in the interest of Liberalism, but which will
not bear the light of an altered sun of political
opinion. Mirams, therefore, is prudent. He lives
In hopes. Heawaits his time. We shall yet see—oh,
Heavens! the sight I—the little man’s small body
clad in a Windsor uniform, and his short legs
encased in breeches and silk stockings. Whether
this ideal picture be realised in the immediate
or remote future, “may we be there to see.”
Mirams is a shining light among total abtalners.
Me is great at tea-and-toast parties. To see him
in the chair at a meeting of tho Grand United
Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association is a
treat, indeed. Patriarchal he looks, as (his small
legs hidden beneath the table) his voluminous
beard and phrenological brow are seen in all their
perfection by the disciples of the Pump, then and
there assembled. His speeches, on these occasions,
are models of temperance oratory; nor does he
fail to enlarge upon the political aspect of the
question, and to hold forth hopes, that by perse-
verance the adherants of the Pump policy may
force the hands of the Government of the future
to handicap public-houses, and abandon the re-
venue from spirits and the like. And yet Mirams,
as chairman of the Tariff Commission, and tauing
upon himself to deliver the views of his brother
commissioners, recommends that local distilleries
should be so welter-weighted that they would
have to close up, to the great advantage and pro-
fit of the importer of foreign liquors, unless, in-
deed, he expected to slay these also, bye and
bye. Of such is the wisdom and the mora-
lity of Mirams the Abstainer. Tak« him for
all in all, however, Mirams is a clever little man.
He hath his ambitions, and he falls into the error
of endeavouring to make his conscience run in
harness with them. Of course, Vis was never
done; and it is likely that the little man has come
to the conclusion that it never will be done.
Meanwhile, he plays a waiting game. Patience and
dullness, as we know, will accomplish more than
genius, without it. But when, to the faculty of
patience, there is allied much talent, great energy,
and a keen perception into the ways of men, we
may believe that he who owns these qualities,
should, sooner or later, oome to the front. Mean-
while, they who judge of merit by the stature of
him who claims it, may remember that Fuller
tells us that “often the cockpit is empty in those
whom Nature hath built exceeding high,” and
that Herbert, in his “ Jacula Prudentum,” states
that “ a dwarf on a giant’s shoulders sees further
of the two.” Figure to yourself, therefore,
Mirams mounted on the shoulders of the giant
Party, and conceive his triumph.

“Love one another,” we are told.
Said Jesus in the days of old.
Our modern Christians think this funny,
For they love one another’s money.
The Rev. Mr. Hurdall has advocated at
the English Congregationalist Union “the aboli-
tion of sermons.” Waking up the people at the
conclusion of the service has worn out three
sextons in eight months.
The Rev. John Osborne intends to estab-
lish Sunday evening lectures to oppose freethought
and "emphasize the ethics of Jesus Christ.” It only
remains now for Pastor Allen to start out to
strengthen the precepts of the Almighty. Worms!
Mr. Irving gave the Rev. Beecher a box in
the theatre while he did the “Merchant of Venice,”
and the Rev. Beecher gave Mr. Irving a pew in the
church while he did the “ Nazarene. We haven’t
a good phrase for this, but we’ll slip in “recipro-
cated resonance,” and leave you to squeeze out
the meaning.
Street organ-grinders in the old country
make £10 a week, and send their families to the
seaside in the watering season. We give this item
for the information of those broadminded clerics
who would laydown the gown if they saw any-
thing else they could do. Organ-grinding is light
and is fairly honest, and their skill with the plate
should be an extra advantage.
At the time of the Luther celebration in
Rome, the monk that shook the world (and a wife)
was described by the Moniteur de Rome as “tho
venomous Intransigeant of the 16th century.”
Spiteful enough that, but true. All orthodox
authority, all "right thinking” people (lovely
lying phrase) of the period, must have held Luther
in exactly the same regard as the same classes of
to-day hold Bradlaugh.
The D.T. advocates a general exodus to
Europe of all clergymen, in order that they may
get an expansion of ideas. We believe the average
young man who clothes his throat with the white
band would certainly get an expansion of ideas by
travel. There should be a Gallivanting Fund
raised to supply purses of sovereigns, and a special
Beet built to keep them circumnavigating the
globe from the day of ordination to the day of
their death. They would expand then.
The recent exposure of the Russian priest,
has caused a grave feeling of disgust
throughout Europe. Seraphin, it appears, suc-
cessfully floated a new religious sect, every mem-
her of which was required to sacrifice his or her
to the superior. These human sacrifices were
then disposed of by the wily Seraphin’s brother -
• gentleman in the hairdressing trade. And now
the question arises as to whether the mysterious
Joints to be met with in many of the small Euro-
P?? 11 towns may not be the “ offerings ” of some
other fanatical sect.

The possibility of a “future state” has
been satisfactorily decided—in the negative. The
Melbourne freethinkers had an evening out, last
week, at their hall in Swanston-street, and one of
the philosophers made a communication which
has set this vexed question at rest for ever. It’s
like this: the Melbourne gentleman arranged with
two other gentlemen to form a syndicate (of
three), the chief condition of membership being
that such of the parties as died first was to return
to his brother members and post them up in any
noteworthy events that might happen beyond the
grave. Well, the Melbourne gentleman begs to
state that both of his colleagues (anxious, no
doubt, to satisfy their pardonable curiosity) have
“defuncted;” but, as he has seen or heard nothing
of them since they broke up the syndicate, he has
much pleasure in informing us that there can be
no future state worth mentioning. It will be ap-
parent to the most superficial observer that the
Melbourne gentleman’s views are correct..
We had assigned a more modern origin to
the Blue Ribbon movement, based on the neces-
sities of the Blue Ribbon men who could raise no
more from the Jews on old clothes. Interpreted
under the light of the following passage, however,
and remembering we are under a new dispensation,
we may take the badge as a symbol of the coming
of the New Jerusalem, and every wearer as a
man who has taken the pledge—back. The com-
mand was (b.c. 3765):—“ Speak to the children of
Israel, and thou shall tell them to make to them-
selves fringes in the corners of their garments,
putting in them ribands of blue, that when they
shall see them they may remember all the com-
mandments of the Lord and not follow their own
thoughts and eyes going astray alter divers things. ’
This cribbing of an ancient rite, and ascribing it to
the modern revivers of it, forcibly suggests that
Booth and Co. found the Jews swimming, and ran
away with their clothes. A literal rendering of
the words “ going astray after divers things ”
suggests this exegesis. Tor the prophecies must
be fulfilled.
According to Dean Maliony—and if he
doesn’t know, we don’t—when a Catholic marries
a Protestant the ceremony cannot take place in a
church, nor can a priest wear any of the “ sacred ”
vestments. The Catholic must do ali he or she
can to convert the other side, by kindness. (We’ve
known the handle of a hoe to be a useful auxiliary
sometimes, when the stock of kindness has run
out.) But the severity of these rules is mild
compared with what you risk by getting spliced
by a clergyman of another Church, or, worse still,
by a Registrar. Then your sin is too big for a
common priest to tackle with any chance of
success—major excommunication is the punish-
ment for it—so you have to cutaway to the bishop
to confess. This “major excommunication” is a
caution. While under it, you are cut off from a
lot of things—among others, from your whack of
blessings “ that are so constantly granted in answer
to public prayers.” The “blessings” derived from
public prayers are very good in their way, but
they sometimes miss their mark and are annexed
by those who have no right to them at all. A Hot-
tentot sometimes meets a bit of a crooked stick in
the woods, stands it up against a tree, and asks it
to do something for him with as much sincerity
as the Queen when she goes in state to St. Paul’s
to pray for rain. As a rule, a vagrant lion stops
the Hottentot's mouth, while Her Majesty’s sup-
plications are usually followed by a long drought
or else sufficient rain to change the country into a
swamp. Still, we would not advise any iriends of
ours to chance a “ major excommunication.” The
bishop might have gone away leaving no power of
attorney to deal with it during his absence
Anxious to confess, with nobody near to hear you I
We can imagine no more unpleasant position, and
can only suggest that in such a case four our five
priests might bo empowered to grant absolution—
a bit a piece.

That gamest of all little horses, Sardonyx,
will now give handicap races a gentle rest. His
whole record shows that although he has been
sent out in 40 races, he has been out of a situa-
tion in only 18 events, having finished first in 6,
second in 13, and third in 3. Huxley’s performances
on the game horse proves him to be one of the
best horsemen in Australia—despite tho tipsters.
Paddy Pigott, the well-known jockey, is
nearly in form once more, and, in addition to
riding, intends shortly to open a training estab-
lishment here. Paddy has now been over twelve
years on tho colonial turf, and amongst his other
famous wins are the Victorian treble of Maribyr-
nong, Derby, and Cup, in Chester’s year, the
Sydney Gold Cup with A.T., and two Wagga Cups.
From his well-known care and ability as a horse-
man we predict a big success for his new venture.
On Monday evening we dropped in to see
the opening show of the Miller-Foley-Victor com-
bination. Miller and Victor went through some
statuesque posing; several pretty rough bouts
with the gloves took place between “ Professor
General Jackson," better known as “Foley’s
Black,” Lee, and another gentleman whose name
we did noCcatch. Miller and Foley showed some
very tame work with the foils and single-sticks,
and gave about the sickest set-to it has been our
lot to witness tor some time past. The best things
of the evening were Victor’s Parisian smile and
three Queensberry’s between Lee and an amateur,
who went in for some right down slogging. The
amateur got on to Lee when and whore he liked,
and proved what we always thought of him—a
really clever boxer; but he is treading on very
ticklish ground, and, as advice is cheap, we don’t
mind giving him one little word of it. DontI
Victor performed some really clever tricks with
a couple of fifty-sixers, and the show closed after a
one act farce by Miller and Victor, termed a
Graeco-Roman wrestling match.
The coming time will be characterised by
extreme width of views. A hint of this was given
in an occurrence at the Intercolonial cricaet
match the other day. One of the New South
Wales team heard by telegram of a family be-
reavement. Ho could not get home in time to
assist in the obsequies, so his friends prevailed
upon him to play on. And the members of both
teams “showed their respect for and sympathy
with him by wearing a band of crape on the left
arm.” This act was as graceful as the conduct of
the bereaved cricketer was sensible. Why should
he give up playing because one of his relatives
was dead ? It Is bad enough to lose a friend, but
no reason for also losing the game. We like to see
things taken in this sportsmanlike spirit. People
die every day, but a ball must be knocked about
the field whoever dies. It must have been a quaint,
yet graceful, sight to see the gay bowlers putting
in round-handers with their elbows in mourning.
We hope to see the time when cricket will be
played in every cemetery. It is a noble game. So
is pitch-and-toss; though, unhappily, falling into
desuetude in consequence of the pernicious cus-
tom of “ ringing in the gray,”
After a careful study of the straight tips
given by our sporting- (?) dallies, we candidly con-
fess that we are losing all faith in El Mahdi’a
claims to be considered the champion False Pro-
phet.
Jokes sometimes recoil on those who
make them. A pretty colonial girl wrote, for fun,
she said, to her English friends, that she was to be
married—just to see how they’d take it. Her
waggish cousins at home at once wrote back their
congratulations, and said they were sending a
suitable present. In due time it arrived—a costly
bercoauuette and a stock of delicate lingerie, with
a message “they hoped it would be in time.”
A priest was visiting a homestead some
distance outside of Townsville, with a view to
arranging for an occasional service. The female
partner in the ranche is of the emotional school of
religionists, but the male boss is an ardent disciple
of the Beheve-Nothlngists.” While the priest
was discussing theology and a quart of tea with
the former, the latter was making frantic efforts
to dislodge some cockroaches from a crevice in a
chest of drawers. The wife called out from the
next room to ask her lord to “ do come and hear
Father Mulolattery’s beautiful ideas on the Com-
munion of Saints.” The exquisite reply that was
wafted to the holy man’s divine ears, tuned to the
eternal Azrafelian melodies, was “Oh, hang the
Communion of Saints I will you bring me the
kerosene oil?” I I 1
The Lismore magistrates are getting their
names up. The other day Messrs. Stocks, Barrie,
and Larkin. J.’s P., refused to hear a case for the
recovery of a debt, on the ground that the plain-
tiff had “signed a document highly disrespectful
to the Bench.” “The Bench,” said the chairman.
Stocks, to the unfortunate plaintiff, “have come
to the conclusion not to hear any more cases in
which you are interested.” Like Dogberry and
Verges, they evidently consider the plaintiff’s con-
duct “ flat burglary,” and, we suppose, are of the
opinion that his proceedings are “ most tolerable,
and not to be endured.” we have no knowledge
of these gentlemen, personally ; but we under-
stand they were appointed to the Commission of
the Peace on the recommendation of the
Grattan of our Assembly, Andrew Lynch.
Esq., M.P. We suppose Mr. Cohen will do
something in this matter, if only to heavily
fetter the person who had the audacity to sign a
document highly disrespectful to the Bench. In
the meanwhile, chaos reigns at Lismore, and the

the attention of their worships. i a u *

Gentlemen,—Some few weeks ago, I was so
severely affected with indisposition as to render
my rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
Fain, on account of severe pains in my back ; and
was just beginning to realise that I would have
to absent myself from my work for a time, when
a friend recommended me to try Hamburg Tea,
mentioning at the same time the beneiit he him-
self had received. At the time I used it, I really
was not fit for my work, and yet in the course of
three or four days I was myself again, and have
not suffered since. I write this conscientiously,
for the guidance of others, and you are at liberty
to make what use you please of it.
Pours faithfully,

PERSONAL ITEMS.
The death of Mrs. Ross-of-Bladensberg
reminds us her title was the only one of the kind
held in England. The affix “ of Bladensberg,” was
conferred on the widow of a General Ross for his
gallant lighting at that place in America, in 1812.
The Marquis of Norrnanby has been

things, and now Mr. .1. Minton Connell is about to

Would like to see him in China.
Lord Rosebery thinks Marcus Clarke “ a
great genius.” That's one for Marcus. But his
Lordship has remembered that Marcus left a wife
and family, and Mrs. Clarke is able to speak kindly
of his Lordship’s interest in her and them. That s
ever so many lor his Lordship.
Wesleyan Conference decision.—The Rev.
George Woolnough received permission to rest
for another year. This is the first time we
heard writing lor a newspaper described as rest-
ing. There is no rest for some people. Wool-
nough is on the 8.M. Herald staff.
The announcement that Lord Rosebery
Intends to have the eldest son of the late Marcus
Clarke entered at the Charterhouse Schools, and
the astounding statement that his Lordship will
give an order for 500copies of “ His Natural Life,
to be distributed among his friends at home, has
provoked a lively curiosity as to what such an ar-
dent admirer of colonial genius is likely to do for
George Darrell. This little matter is, wo believe,
still under his noble consideration, as also Sladeu’s
exact position in the peerage.
Mr. u. M. Davies. M L.A., of Victoria, saw
the Pons comet at Buninyong, and is very elo-
quent ever since. He saw it a little north of
Venus, and complains that its head was a little out
of centre and its tail hardly anywhere. It is all
very well for Mr. Davies to show off his critical
ability at Buninyong, and speak disparagingly of
the head and tail of Pons. These things have two
sides. Now, we looked at Mr. Davies a little north
of Buninyong one time, and we kept our opinion
of his head and tail to ourselves. He would have
punched us if we telegraphed it about.
Mr. Benjamin Douglas, the representative
working-man of Victoria, was sent for by Lord
Rosebery ** I was sent for,” said Mr. Douglas to
his guests at the Trades Hall, “and I went. I
didn’t know what his Lordship wanted with me,
but I went.” Thereupon some caustic critics ask
the representative working-man whether ho
would have left his work, tidied himself up, and
gone with such graceful willingne°s, if it had been
his Lordship’s valet who sent for him. The caustic
critics have certainly a hold of something, but
is it fair to twitch the working-man by this one
little tuft of humbug, when nil around him the
growth of sycophancy is as thick as a Northern
scrub ?
Among the hundreds of individuals who
still rejoice in the belief that the “ Claimant is the
right man, you know,” how many are there pos-
sessing any knowledge of the real facts of the
Tichborne case? The surest way of exposing
their ignorance is to ask them how many years
elapsed between Roger Tichborne’s departure
from England and the fat Impostor’s first appear-
ance as a baronet. Somewhere about five and
twenty years is the usual surmise—twelve is nearer
the mark. In twelve years he had forgotten his
own name, his mother’s name, hla birth-place —
everything, in fact, if his ridiculous story is to be
believed. Stay, he did recollect one thing about
Roger, for after making the acquaintance of the
family washerwoman, ho “recollected” the pat-
tern of Roger’s shirts.
Miss Mary Anderson is a beautiful woman,
either on the stage or off it; and they say she is
very good. The combination is unusual. A native
of California, sho first went on the stage for love
of it, but meeting with great success, she remained
on it, and since 1879 has hardly known what it is to
play in a theatre not crammed. Notwithstanding
that Miss Anderson is celebrated for her splendid
taco and figure, she is as superior to the first stage
beauties of the Kate Vaughan and Connie Gilchrist
stamp as William Miller is to a dude. She is a
refined actress, with a keen perception of true art
which enables her to wed naturalness and artifice
fitly together In the way so essential to stage effect.

On herappearance in London, among the bouquets
on the first night a beautiful ba=ket of lilies was
handed up with a card bearing in bold handwriting
“With best wishes from Lillie Langtry and a
night or two afterwards the Prince of Wales sent
to ask when Miss Anderson would find it con-
venient to be introduced to him. Her reply was
unexpected. Hitherto, no scandal had tainted her
name, and as she feared an introduction to His
Ltoyal Highness could have no other effect than
creating one, she must decline the honour. Albert
Edward went off his appetite for two meals on
getting this little Jar. But, a few days after, Miss
Anderson was invited by the Princess of Wales to
a garden party. And it may be whispered, almost
inaudibly, that she has reached the charming age
of 24.
Samuel Kershaw, who, until the other day
resided at a Melbourne coffee tavern, was of a
thoroughly original and independent turn of
mind, judging from the evidence forthcoming
when he was “inquested.’ Samuel, it appears,
had sojourned in the Southern hemisphere for
some six years, leaving England on the very day
that Mrs. K. gave birth to her first “infant
Samuel.” Furthermore, he took his departure
from Albion’s shores without evincing the slight-
fit deiire to “ ife the baby,” “for which conduct"
(said the witness) “no reason could be assigued.”
Now, although some married men may be disposed
to doubt the accuracy of the witness’ naive asser-
tion, still the fact remains that Korsham’s conduct
on that interesting occasion was just a little pro-
nounced—not to say eccentric—and, in a measure,
E repares us for the business-like manner in which
e arranged his decease. Previous to retiring to
rest, Samuel took fifteen grains of opium and
fifteen grains of chloral; then he swallowed a
“package” of arsenic; and to make “assurance
doubly sure,” he held in reserve a large quantity
of strychnine. From the fact that his bndy was
discovered in a sitting posture, the assumption is
that he must have been just feeling round for the
strychnine to “make sure,” when the somewhat
hurried arrival of Grim Death prevented him from
carrying out his purpose.
“ Morality was impossible without the
Bible. In that book, it is said, there were mis-
takes. Suppose there were, did this vitiate its
whole tenor and life ? Johnson believed in ghosts,
and Luther in a material eevil, but were they,
therefore, without intellect? . . . Freethinkers
claimed to be scientific and progressive. The man
in the moon know as much science as they.”
Those ai’e the sentiments of the Rev. John Osborne,
expressed by him in the York-street Wesleyan
Cmrch before he joined the staff of the Rum. There
is a ring of simple truth about them that earries
canviction even to indurated hearts like ours.
But, although contemplating a change from the
sacerdotal to the literary profession, he was
anxious not to relinquish the former altogether.
He had nineteen reasons for desiring not to give
up preaching entirely. We only arrived when he
was giving the nineteenth; but, if the preceding
ones were equally strong, ho certainly made out a
good ease. The one we heard was that the D.T,
screw was not enough to keep him and
those depending on him, so ho elected, during
his spare time, to continue hostilities against
Satan. This was bad news for the latter, who has
had to put up with a good deal of misrepresenta-
tion lately, and naturally looked for a little slack-
ness in vituperation when he hoard the Rev. John
was going on the press. But enough of this flip-
pancy-let us return to the quotation given on
top. Seems a little “mixed,” doesn’t it? Let’s
see. “No morality without the Bible.” Appears,
to us, then, that there is precious little morality
in the world, considering that four-fifths of the
inhabitants never hoard of the Bible. And it also
appears to us that the old Greeks, who never
heard of it. gave to tho world types of man and
womanhood quite as high as those given by the
old Jews who produced it. And a number of
other things appears to us— inter alia, that there
are tales told in it so delightfully immoral, not to
put too fine a point on it, that you would never
think of reading them to your wife and daughters.
We know, of course, that it is the secret of Eng-
land’s greatness, but that did not prevent the
gracious lady who said so from sending out big
ships and big guns to make the Chinese oat opium,
nor did it keep her sainted grandfather from sup-
plying the North American Indians with scalping-
knives to teach loyalty to Yankee women and
children. We might say a lot more on this matter,
but enough has been said to suggest that the half-
million or so of people who read the D.T. have a
treat in store for them.
Lieut-General Sheridan, commanding the
United States Army, is brusque and bow-legged,
but quiet and unostentatious in manner. The fun
is, that though he is very ordinary, his wife thinks
him the handsomest man in the country. Its a
mistake few married men would quarrel with
their wives about. The wives very seldom make
it. Mrs. Phil. Sheridan is a petite, red-haired,
spunky little woman, and so fond of her Phil, that
when his portrait was painted by a celebrated
artist, who, she considered, did not do him justice,
she drove down to the room where it was and
obliterated the face with a paint brush. When
Phil, discovered what she had done, he never said
an\ thing. It was not because the Lieut.-General
commanding the United States Army was afraid.
No. but he didn’t see any use altering the dear
little woman’s opinion about his good looks.
Mr. Bosisto, the Eucalyptus Oil man of
Victoria, is a very good letter-writer. He is good
at otherthings, but it is correspondent
he excels. There is something Chesterfleldian in
his style and turn of thought. He is now in India,
and we are all glad to hear from him. He «ays he
sweats so much that “if I put my hand in my
pocket it sticks.” There is a naive elegance about
this “it sticks.” But then he apprises us that
there were catamarans about him, and that the
people were pestering him to buy something.
Possibly, that helped his hand to “ stick.” It used
to do one time, even in winter. But he says: “The
other day, on going to my room, there was a
queecha, a kind of nasty-looking iguano, on the
wall. I watched him for a time, wondering who
or'what he was. He swallowed a moth which
lodged beside him, and I went to bed wondering
whether he intended to try and swallow me.”
Great. Jupiter! Wish he had!
In 1883, the eldest son of Prince Frederick
Of f’ilra, the young Count Alfred, then studying
at the Ronn University, ran away from homo be-
cause his family would not allow him to marry a
young girl, well brought up, and whose parents
were comfortably off, but of comparatively low
birth. For a whole year the Prince of Palm re-
mained ignora't of his son’s whereabouts, and
was only informed last September that he was
workmg as a navvy on the Illinois railway, a few
miles from Chicago. Ho had been recognised by
another navvy of the name of Schneider, who
had served in Germany in the same regiment of
Hussars as the young Prince. Schneider wrote to
the Prince to inform him that the Count and him-
self occupied the same lodging at Chicago. The
Prince immediately sent the manager of his estate
to bring back the prodigal son, who refused to
return unless he was allowed to marry the lady
for whose sake ha had left home and country.
The Prince’s consent to the match has been
granted.
Another fashionable London actor has
been figuring in the Divorce Court—this time,
though, in the somewhat unprofessional role of
“ petitioner.” The Injured one is Arthur Dacre, a
first-rate jeune premier and a pretty fellow (so the
ladies say), but, apparently, rather a melodramatic
kind of husband. It came out during the trial
that the elegant Arthur had been studying the
character of Mr. Mantalini, and by way of working
on the feelings of his unappreciative spouse,
threatened to make a “dem’d, moist, unpleasant
body” of himse’f, during one of their domestic
storms. After inflicting a uolicate scratch on his
swan-like neck with a broken tumbler, Arthur
(who is a qualified medical man, by the bye) pro-
duced a lancet, and announced his intention of
opening a vein in his wrist and blecdim.vto death.
Instead of opening the vein, though, which might
have really caused him considerable inconveni-
ence, the prudent young medical actor restricted
himself to a “ slight scratch,” and a little sticking-
plaster on his wrist and neck soon restored to him
his blushing beauty. However, he certainly did
go just a little further than our old friend, Manta-
iini, and it may be that these harrowing details
will even increase the already numerous feminine
admirer of the popular stage lover.
“A splendid legend—splendid lie ” is told
about Daniel Home, the erst famous Spiritualist
impostor. A few years ago he visited Rome, and
became a convert to the Faith. His Holiness the
Pope was so pleased to have “ plucked from the
burning” such a dangerous infidel, that he
granted him several personal Interviews at the
Vatican. But even Popes are not entirely above
that human fading, curiosity, and it was at one of
these audiences that, by dear old Pio Nono's gra-
ciously, but imprudently, expressing a desire to
see a “manifestation,” the conversion of months
was all undone in a moment, and t he fold lost a
sheep. It happened thus: No sooner had his Holi-
ness settled back in his chair, calmly incredulous
that any spirits would be bold enough to manifest
in his presence, than a cushion from under his
holy feet suddenly got un on end, and after dancing
a distinct polka twice round the room, frisked up
to Daniel Homo and tapped him on the nose. Pio
was speechless with astonishment, the attendants
muttered many a prayer, ana Cardinal Antonelli
was, in the hush that fell upon all, distinctly hoard
to pronounce the word “ devil.” Daniel was the
first to speak; he assured his Emin mce it was not
his Satanic Majesty who had unkindly dealt him
this blow, but the spirit of his first wife. At this,
the cushion rose once more and gave Mr. Home
three blows which staggered him. The Pope
looked grave, the Cardinal darkly frowned, the
attendants prayed harder than before, but Daniel
entreated them not to be alarmed. Such little
occurrences had often happened to him in earth
life before—it was just like his wife, he said. He
was solemnly advised to abjure such things, and
on his declining, was told that the Holy Church
could receive him not. So Daniel relapsed. This
is believed to bo the best lie ever told about Homo
—putting aside, of course, his own little efforts.
It is with pain and anguish wringing the
brow that we note the continued persecution of
the Rev. Mr. Alfred Graves, late Church of Eng-
land minister at Elmore, Victoria. Alfred, it
seems, is now committed on a number of so-called
charges, and we have no doubt that he, whilst
enduring temporary incarceration finds relief in
praying for his oppressors. Alfred has been be-
fore the public a good deal. In connection with
Elmore, it seems that Mr. Graves’ zeal (of which
he seems to have a superabundance) attracted the
notice of his bishop, and tor some time Alfred
sought somewhere the seclusion which a private
boai’ding-house grants, and nothing further was
heard of him. Suddenly the public is informed by
the newspapers that the rev. gentleman possesses
an inordinate love of oysters. He is in Geelong
this time, and goes in for nothing less than a
barrel a pop. He also developes a love for hosiery,
and legal complications are the result; the law, it
seems, possessing but little sympathy with clergy-
men of the Church of England who eat oysters by
the barrel and are inordinately fopd of hosiery.
The oyster man, it would appear, got angry about
something, and though Alfred says, similarly tt
the sock-man (in the words of the burlesque) : —
“ True, my hosier, true, I owes yer,
But I cannot pay yer, h’aujourdhui,"
he would not be pacified, and some little trouble
was the result. Dressed in the glossiest of black
clerical garments, the stiffest of chokers, and
weeping copiously into a tent-fly of virgin white-
ness, the rev. gentleman pulled through trium-
phantly, and wept himself away from the Court
on the arm of a brother-clergyman, to the great
admiration of the hy-standers. But—as Billy
Sweatman used to say—“the villain still pursued
him.” Just as the Elmore people were preparing
to welcome him back with hymns and banners,
lo, and behold, trouble again ensues: his enemies
being resolved on his destruction. Then all the
“ a.G.” monograms were picked out of the smok-
ing-caps and slippers, the triumphal arches were
taken down, and patchwork quilts were made of
the banners. The little anthem—commencing
Our minister is free again,
Once in our church he’s seated;
His enemies all strove in vain.
And them he has defeated I—
was never sung, and it is rumoured that when
popular grief had, in a manner, subsided, a re-
action of feeling set in, and Alfred Graves’ boots
were burned in efflgy. The rev. gentleman is
now, to all appearance, more persecuted than
ever. He turned out to be as fond of
boating as he was of oysters, and the demon
once more pursued him. All this is rather
a bother to us. We have been looking forward,
during the last year, to hearing Alfred G. hold
forth, and to being rendered better and chaster by
the rev. gentleman’s ministrations. If he pulls
through this, however, our mite will be ready to-
wards installing him in a tin church, and buying
him a pair of celluloid cuffs, that he may “ shcot,"
while pronouncing the benediction of us hardenea
sinners, with his fingers locked over the time-pay-
ment Bible, We are getting tired of the Salvation
man, who boasts of stealing flat-irons, and then
implores tho spotless listener to “ mend his hevil
ways.”

A gay young organist in a Melbourne
suburb has got into trouble for playing at church
a march from a popular opera bouffe. Although
he played very slowly and solemnly, seven deacons
recognised tho air at once.... A Melbourne paper
refers to the renowned poet and painter of the
fleshly school as Daniel Gabriel Rosetti. This Is
very rough on a man who’s dead Extracts from
the home papers are circulated in Melbourne,
eulogising the “h’gh personal character ” of Mr.
Richard Speight, the chairman of the Victorian
railway commissioners. We are sure the extracts
speak the truth. But, will not the contrast be-
tween Mr. Speight and those who appointed him
be damaging to tho Ministry ? Perhaps.

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
In South Australia, a man named Andrew
Fry waged £5 that he could dig three tons of pota-
toes in a day. Fry finished his task a few minutes
inside the 13 hours.
In England, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, on a
sociable, recently covered 10 miles in 41min, 40 l-5th
sec, and beat the best on record.
Dan O’Leary and Frank Hart are backed
to walk two unknowns (probably Harriman and
Roes) for an alleged £400, at San Francisco.
At San Francisco, in a cricket match be-
tween the Australian and World elevens of the
Occident and Merlon Cricket Clubs, the Australian
team won by 59 to 37.
John L. Sullivan received £285 for pitching
five innings’ against the St. Louis Baseball Club.
After this, can we wonder the champion slogger
refuses Miller’s offer to visit Australia ?
Vanderbilt refused to rent Madison Square
Gardens (N.Y.), for a six days’ walking match, for
a less sum than £2000. This ought io prove a
settler to the proposed Rowell-Fitzgerald contest.
“ Young Dutohy ” has turned up in
’Frisco, where be is billed as “Professor Young
Dutchy, the Australian Light-weight Champion.’’
He is trying to arrange a prize fight with Ned
Price.
At the New York (U.S.) Athletic Club
grounds, M. W. Ford, an amateur, cover 10 ft.
in. in a standing wide jump, and made a record.
The previous best was made by J. J. Tickle, Eng-
land—10 ft. 5 in.
Gr. M. Robinson, the ’Frisco heavy-weight,
who is credited with trouncing Slade with the
gloves, recently elevated a dumb-bell 80
times, and boat the previous best, which was 58
times. Our D’Harcourt can put up the 701h.bell
some 25 times.
Frank Homan ran a man, stated to be F.
Raymond, at Boston, 400 yards, on November u.
Homan won in43sec., the fastest time on record,
If correct. “Raymond” turned out to be F.
Davis, of 'Frisco, the fastest quarter-mile runner
m America, it not the world.
Haulan and Lee recently appeared as a
draw in the baseball field, ’Frisco; but the show
was a frost. The ’Fiisco Newsletter says: —
Hanlan’s efforts were more in the burlesque line
than anything el«e, and we cannot commend his
taste in taking part in such a humbug.”
A New York paper says O’Learv has issued
a challenge in ’Frisco to walk any man for £300 a
side and the championship of the world. The
championship business is refreshing, considering
Edwards walked the Vankee’s hair off in Australia,
ihe same paper says he returned laden with Aus-
tralian gold Walker!
Henry W. Kirby, considered the best ama-
teur sculler in America, has been expelled by the
National Association from rowing as an amateur
for ever, on account of some crooked business
sheeted home to him. It is state* that Kirby will
■jom the ranks of the professionals next year.
Delicate compliment to tjse professional.
Bombala folks had anything but agree-
able weather for their race meeting on Thursday
mst. Lady Pitsford appropriated the Maiden-
mate; lantawanglo boat Dove by a bare head for
the Jockey Club Handicap: Lady Pitsford made a
second win of the Trial Stakes; Tantawanglo ditto
or the Flying Handicap, and Yuraminie made an
easy win of the Forced Handicap.
A glove tight came off recently at Laun-
ceston, Tasmania, between “ Professor ” West and
Dinney Hennebery, a local bruiser, for a £10
trophy and gate money. Heneberry took a strong
lead tor the first two rounds, but the “ Professor ”
wa P all there in the third, and knocked his man
out of time. Launceston has the Queensberry
craze, and several more matches are on the tapis.
The owner of the yacht Daphne has every
reason to be proud of his crew, for they showed
extraordinary skill and pluck in the manner in
which they handled her on Saturday week; for,
aespite the fact there were only four working
nands on board, including the owner and man in
charge, they set and took in sails, in a style which
won lor them deserved applause from the specta-
tors on the Admiral.
. ■\ Davis is stated to be the coming wing
snot of America. He recently grassed 98 out of

The Our Boys Cricket Club and the man-
ager of the Junior Cup contests have been at
loggerheads in consequence of the former making
their Cup matches secondary to other matters.
Until Mr. Ironsides took the juniors up they were
never heard of, and it hardly seems the thing for
them now to throw difficulties in his way. The
clubs should keep in mind that if these Cup
matches come to an untimely end, the Juniors
will, without doubt, drift back into the obscurity
from which the energetic manager has tempora-
rily raised them.
Our readers may recollect an account we
fave of a foot race in America, between “Little
lume,” an Indian lad, and George Irvine, in
which Irvine knocked his opponent down and
kicked him. Another 5 mile race came off on Nov.
8, between the pair, which resulted in another
win for the ‘’native,” in 27 mir. 23 sec. In this
case a quantity of broken glass w r as found mixed
with tne sawdust on the track, the supposition
being that it was intended to cut the feet of the
Indian, who, in the previous race, ran in his bare
feet, but this time he ran in mocassins.
The Mudgee Independent «taff would
seem to have been in heavy training for Anni-
versary Day, judging from the issue of 12th Janu-
ary. Under the heading of “ Sporting,” we find :—
“Trickett has ordered a new shell from Donnelly
and Sullernan. Clifford has been doing his utmost
of get on a match with Niel O'Donnell. Mr. A. T.
Smart has purchased Coir from Mr. de Mester.
Perhaps Trickett and Hlias will accomodate Ross
and Hanlan in a double-scull race.” And the
Mudgee Mrs. Partington winds up by saying the
sporting fraternity of Victoria must be in a sad
state of depravity, as Suwarrow went begging at
200 guineas. Of course, the Italics are ours.
Considering the counter attractions, the
Sydney Turf Club cannot growl at the attendance
at the Summer meeting on Saturday last. He r e’s
Luck defeated Hypatia by three-quarters of a
mile for the Flying Handicap, Coolabah third; and
War Eagle won the Hurdle Race, Councillor, a
short length away, second, Flamborough third.
Chesterton fell and hurt Kildutf, his rider. Lord
Exeter, after a great struggle up the straight,
landed the January Stakes by a short head from
Liberte, Bolero third ; Here’s Luck made a second
and unexpected win of the Anniversary Handi-
cap, the unlucky Sardonyx second, Empress
third ; Prima Donna beat Allandor by a short head
for the Selling Plate, The Witch third ; and Raven
appropriated the Ladies’ Bracelet from Strath-
more, Minorca third. The starting all through
was the worst we ever saw on a course.
Now that William Elliott, the English
sculler, has returned to the land of his birth and
commenced issuing challenges, it is to be hoped
that ho will meet with sufficient success to permit
of him squaring up some of the little debts which
slipped his memory when he departed for the
States. After the advent of Hanlan had put an
extinguisher on Billy’s aquatic pretensions, he
tried the old game-making a book. An inability
to grapple with figures, however, combined with
the possession of a head-piece which is enough to
frignten any youthful backer off a race-course,
militated against the “pitman’s” success in his
new walk of life. At Midland and Southern race
meetings, the ex-Champion Sculler of the World—
as he advertised himself—was a terrible frost; but
io the neighbourhood of the Tyne, certain indivi-
duals were confiding enough to lay out their little
bits with the fallen idol. William, however, abused
their confidence, and levanted in very bad odour.
Other sporting celebrities have similarly distin-
guished themselves.
The untimely death of Earl Grosvenor,
the eldest son of the Duke of Westminster, will,
in all probability, terminate the Duke’s racing
career, and the English turf will lose one of its
most influential and munificent patrons. When
“the richest man in the world” so unexpectedly
Joined the; ranks of the turfites, some seven
years back, it was generally understood that he
was forming a stud more for his eldest sou’s
amusement than his own: and although, as time
went on, papa evinced quite as lively an interest
m racing matters as “ the boy,” it is not likely that
the “black and yellow” of the Grosvenors will
long .figure on the i-aeecourse after this family
bereavement. It will be remembered that the
Duke of Westminster paid what is reputed to be
the highest price ever paid for a thoroughbred
horse when he secured Doncaster at a figure of
fifteen thousand guineas, for stud purposes. The
deal was not a bad one,; for Doncaster’s son, Bond’
Or, seemred for the Duke his first Derby in 1880, I
defeating such an equine wonder as Robert the
UoviL two years later, Shotover boro the “ black 1
and yellow ” to the fore for the great Bosom
event; and, altogether, the Duke’s racing career,
even allowing for the large amount of capital ex-
pended, has been very successful.
A correspondent has asked us to give an
outline of the Queensberry rules for boxing com-
petitions. The rules in question specify a fair
stand-up boxing match, in a 31-foot ring; no
wrestling allowed; rounds of three minutes dura-
tion and one minute time; if either man fall, he
must get up unassisted; ten seconds allowed to do
so, the other man, meanwhile, to return to his
corner, and when the fallen man is on his legs, the
round to be resumed until the three minutes have
expired, and if one man fails to come to the
scratch in the ten seconds allowed, it shall be in
the power of the referee to give his award in
favour of the other man ; a man hanging on the
ropes in a helpless state shall be considered down;
no seconds to be allowed into the ring during the
rounds; should the contest be stopped, referee to
nauiotlmo and placa to finish the contest, unless
backers of both men agree to draw the stakes.
The g’.oves to be fair-sized boxing gloves. A man

It is stated of Walton, the Yankee “Plun-
ger,” that at the Doncaster (Eng.) race meeting he
went up to Fred. Archer and said to him:— ** I’ve
got a £100 to put on a horse for you, Archer.
Which shall it be ?” A rcher named the horse, the
first favourite, at 3 to 1 ; Walton backed the
animal, and it won. Again he asked Archer what
he would like to back with the £300, now supposed
to be his, and the jockey advised him to wait, as
the next race was very uncertain. A good thing,
at 6 to 4, followed, and Walton laid £300 to £300 for
Archer — what he laid for himself is another
matter. There were other races in the course of
the day; but before the last race Archer had a
“ monkey ”—£500 in hand. This ho advised Walton
to lump on to a certain animal which he rode, and
he was beaten a short head! Walton defends him-
self by saying that he does not pay jockeys to lose
races, and, therefore, that what he does is not ille-
gitimate; but, no doubt, Lord Falmouth, the Duke
of Portland, Lord Hastings, or any other of
Archer’s employers would not have the same
opinion if this sort of thing were carried on to any
great extent.!
I Am English paper tells rather a good story
I of Gladiateur, the winner of the Two Thousand
Guineas, Derby and Leger. being taken for a har-
j ness horse. One day Jack Abel was driving
1 throug h the streets of Newmarket when ho met
I Tom Jennings. ” Hullo, Tom, ’ he called out,
“ have you got any of your big-boned ugly brutes
i that are too slow for racing that you want to sell
j tor twenty or thirty pounds apiece?” Tom
I thought for a moment, and then, with a mischiev-
i ous twinkle in his eye, said, “ Yes, two or three,
j Come round and look at ’em.” In the course of
! time, John Abel arrived at Phantom Cottage, and
was £hown into a box in which there was a big-
i boned angular-looking horse. ’“You can't want
i much for that 'un, Tom,” ho said. *• I shan’t stand
| more than twenty for that,” and he raised his
stick iu order to make him move over. “ For
J God's sake, don't hit him or be will kick us ail out
j of the box,” said Tom, iu an alarmed manner,
i “ Oh, you ugly brute, I’ll teach you manners when
| I get you,” replied Jack, apostrophising the horse,
I and then turning to the boy, who was looking on
1 the whole proceeding’ as though he were thunder-
struck, "What’s his name, boy?” “ Gladiateur,
sir.” Jack Abel bolted out ot the box, and made
the best time to the railway station that was ever
accomplished by a man of fits years.
The National Regatta of 1884 passed off
with its customary success. His Excellency paid a
duty visit to thellagship, and the courteous caterer
—but we think we have seen this somewhere be-
fore. As wo anticipated, the 24-foot race for the
Mayor’s Cup proved a frr>st. The Victor won,
with the Lottie close up; and the Carlottac jogged
along hopelessly some miles to the rear. The Mer-
c initio Rowing Club swept the board tor the ama-
teur rowing races, by winning the Junior Sculls,
Senior Fours, Maiden Fours, i aidley Sculls,
Junior Fours and Junior Double Scuds, the re-
spective crews being:-Mr. R. W. Roll, Messw.
Seale, dickering, Brett, and Martin; Messrs. Grace,
Warre, Taylor, and Brindley; and Messrs. Donald-
son and Seale. The Latona won the Canvas Dingy
race; The Ouida won the 16ft. Dingy race; Mr. P.
O. Williams carried off the 19ft. Dingy race, with
the Desderaona; the St. Crispin, sailed by Fletcher,
defeated the Rosetta, with her owner at the pick-
handle ; the Sirocco won the handicap for yachts
ten tons and upwards; Beach and Trickett finished
in the order named for the Champion raoo, but
owing to a foul, the umpire decided the pair
should race again on Saturday next: Dr. Milford's
little flyer, the Sao. showed her heels to the other
competitors in the Under Ten Tows Handicap; the
Mantana came in first for the Half Deck race,
Buttercup second ; Young Victor won the Hit.
Dingy race; and Mo senger defeated Pearce in the
AH Coiners’ Light Skiff Handicap,
The Cleveland (U.8 ) Herald says
“Slugger Sullivan is making a prolonged frolic
of his Western tour. He gets into bar-room
fights wherever ho goes. In Dayton, Ohio, his
whole company of sluggers Indulged in an up-
roarious spree. While in a gambling house, Sulli-
van offended a man, who drew a revolver, but
was too slow, for, before ho could carryout his
threat, Sullivan knocked him through the swing-
ing doors i"to the street. In an Iowa railroad
station, Sullivan and his wife wore the first to leave
the waiting-room when the train came in. The
champion closed thn door and held it. Half-dozen
gentlemen and ladles on the inside made frantic
efforts to open the door as their train prepared to
start, but Sullivan playfully held it as long as he
could and reach the train himself, and then let go,
throwing the tugging citizens on their backs.
Before they could recover themselves, the train
and bully were gone. Sullivan’s treasurer says he
is nothing more than an overgrown boy; that he
spends £10 a day, and would get the combination
into trouble if he were not watched.” By the way,
Sullivan holds a very easy lease of his title of
“champion;” ho has only fought one bona fide
battle in the ring, and steadily refuses to make a
match with bare knuckles, although R. K. Fox
offers to back Paddy Ryan against 1dm for £500,
London Prize Ring rules; and a deposit has been
put up on behalf of Pendergast for a similar en-
counter. Sullivan ought certainly accept one of
these, or drop the title of “ Champion*”
The noble art is certainly coining into
favour again amongst English sportsmen, al-
though, as in America, glove contests have taken
the place of tights under the old rules of the
London prize ring. Within the week ended De-
cember 2, two affairs came off in London, of which
says “Pendragon,” of the Referee, “both were
the best of their kind, within ray not altogether
limited experience.” Tins coming from “ Pen.,"
who, although perhaps the greatest growler, is
one of the best judges of pugilistic matters in
England, would seem a guarantee that the bouts
were something out of the common. The first was
a competition between eight picked men, limit
lOst. 41b., the man who obtained the greatest num-
ber of points to be declared the winner. After
some clever boxing, the men were weeded out,
till Qhook, a full-blooded African, and Plcton faced
each other in the final bout, which was so even
that t ho judges could not give any decision, and a
fourth round was ordered. This was a most slash-
ing affair, and after some really brilliant work the
bout was given in favour of Picton, who is barely
eighteen years of age. The second was a continu-
ation of the Goode-Roberts affair, which ended on
the previous occasion in a draw, in consequence of
the lights being put out, and ot which we gave an
account in last issue. The fight in this instance
was carried out in a most orderly manner, and
Goode, as in the first instance, took the lead from
the start and knocked Roberta out after eighty-
two minutes of desperate fighting. An incident
which took place when the finish was close to hand
is worthy of mention. Tim seconds of Roberts
clamoured for brandy to keep their man from
tainting, but none wf s to bo got. With character-
istic impulsiveness, old Goode, who was seconding
his son, rushed across the ring, saying he could not
allow so bravo a lad to go without while he had
any, and held out his bottle to his son’s opponent.

done by the' family appearing in white tights and

present historical and other subjects of the art.
Everything in this is certainly very cleverly
executed, and the applause which nightly greets
the “statues” shows how much this portion of
the programme is enjoyed.
Kent Echo.— The Brothers Faust.—These clever
artists went through a variety of laughable antics,
performed seme remarkable trick playing, and
showed several acrobatic feats, Including somer-
sault throwing, all the while keeping the music
going; and when they concluded, they received
the well-merited plaudits of the large audience.

A party signing “Soalfax,” writing to the
Otago Witness, from Melbourne, resembles a
certain legendary personage, from the fact of his
knowing all about it. He says: “ In my next
letter I shall be able to tell you the story of the
making of Wilson Barrett, the creator of ‘ The
Silver King,’ ‘ Romanv Bye,’ ‘ Lights o’ London,’
&c. Should space permit, I may also relate a
romantic episode in the life of Miss Genevieve
Ward, who is shortly to appear at the Theatre
Boyal as Stephanie de Mohrivart, in ‘ Forget-Me-
Not.’ The circumstances are known to very few
of Miss Ward’s admirers.” We are glad to hear
that Mr. Wilson Barrett is the “creator of the
‘Lights o’ London;’” and should pant for the
romantic episode, if we hadn’t had it “slung” at
us from half-a-doaen quarters twice a week ever
since Genevieve’s arrival. W e have even seenit

Captain Henry Mapleson, husband of the
popular prima donna, Madame Marie Roze, was
recently gazetted major in the 4th Lancashire
Artillery Corps. Major Henry Mapleson bids tair
to bo a major-general now before his father, the
redoubtable Lleut.-Colonel J. H. Mapleson, whom
a wicked New York paragraphist once described as
being accustomed to the smell of powder—that is,
of violet powder — Kobbd thus places the great
opera singers now in New York Nilsson, Patti,
Gerster, Sembrich. Nilsson’s premier place is thus
justified “Patti’s voice is like a superb music-
box, as perhaps many a one has said before. It is
perfect in time, tune, and brilliancy, and she can
rattle off a cadenza with unexampled rapidity ;
but the little diva, though she has a pretty knack
at money-making, has no more soul than that
modern atrocity, a Weber singing doll.”.... After
Dion Boucicault’s scathing criticisms upon Mrs.
Langtry, it must be rather difficult for the veteran
author-actor to square his conscience over his
latest theatrical venture. Mrs. Maddick, another
of the professional-beauty sisterhood, is about to
emulate the Lily by making a dramatic tour of
the States, under Boucicault’s management, and
seeing that Mrs. Langtry can concede a good many
points to “ the Maddick ’’—either as actress or P.B.
—it is difficult to believe that Boucicault’s protigi
will prove a good spec. The jealousy of the New
York ladles towards the Jersey Lily, however, may
inspire them to discover superlative charms in her
latest rival, and the astute Dion, who bears the
reputation of being an accomplished student of
the feminine heart, has perhaps reckoned upon a
little bit of feeling ” being instrumental in secur-
ing a good reception for his fashionable novice.

vides EXQUISITE GIFTS from 5s. to £5:
Articles of dainty design and enduring beauty,
which will give delight at the first glance, and
. , will last a lifetime.
ORIENTAL GOLD is the very latest discovery
of the alchemist's laboratory. There have been
good and useful imitations of sterling gold before
it; but all have been thrown into the shade by
this triumph of modern science. Articles or
oriental Gold cannot, after years of wear, be dis-
tinguished from the costliest wares of the gold-
smith. So noble is this metal, that no tawdry
goods of old and inferior designs are manufac-
tured of it. The discoverers have not condescended
to apply it to base uses.
THE VERY LATEST DESIGNS INf JEWELLERY
AND BIJOUTERIE
are regularly worked up in Oriental Gold simul-
taneously with their production in sterling metal,
and, placed side by side, the one article cannot b©
told from the other.
THE PRICE OF ARTICLES OP ORIENTAL
GOLD IS BUT A TRIFLE
when compared with identical models of sterling
metal.
Someof the goods are mounted with the NEW
DIAMONDS, another masterpiece of the chemists
of the nineteenth century-artificial stones which
equal the noblest brilliants in fire and glitter, and
rival them in hardness.
The Artist-designers of Paris have, with eager
appreciation, adopted Oriental Gold as worthy to
receive their happiest conceptions. The most
graceful Parisian models are impressed upon a
portion of our stock, which is replenished with
novelties by every mail.

•The German Army, standing in single file,
and allowing each man three feetjof space, won Id
line the coast irom Cape York to Cape Howe.
The further calculation suggested, of how long it
would take to pass a copy of The Bulletin
from Von Moltke’s hand at Cape Howe to Bis-
marck's tent in Cape York, cannot be made in
arithmetic, but must be judged by moral con-
siderations. The first old warrior would probably
fold up the paper after reading it, and post it home
to Fatherland.
For the last two months upwards of sixty
hands have been constantly employed at D. J.
Munk’s Australian Vinegar Works, meeting the
increased output of the establishment. The
whole of the Sydney and N.S.W. trade generally
has now virtually been completely won by the
Australian Vinegar Works without any great
financial assistance, showing that once more
industry and good management are the sole basis
of manufacturing success.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatre Royal— “ Christmas Pantomime ”. .p. 8.
opera House— “Jealousy ’’ lb.
Chiarini’s Royal Italian Circus ib.
Chiarini's is worth a visit, if only for the
clowns. There are three of these, each possessing:
characteristics of his own. In one thing they all
agree—their savage vindictiveness towards the
letter H. The presence of this inoffensive conson-
ant appears to arouse the worst passions of their
nature. They scruff him in when he would rather
stav away and run him out when he puts forward
a claim to be present. No. 1 “ basked to be saved
from the hugly”—something or another. We
forget precisely what he said, but know it was
something insulting and referred to the unsym-
pathetic ringmastex-. No. 3 admitted that the
estrangement between himself and the young lady
to whom he appeared much attached, arose from
bis observing her devour “ ’arf a plate of ’am.”
No. 3 was Holloway. We were more taken up
with what he did than what he said. And he did
the most absurd things—things that, if you had a
laugh secreted anywhere in your system, would
be sure to find it out and bring it to the surface.
The jokes, of course, belonged to the hoariest an-
tiquity-long before the splitting up of the Aryan
family—with the exception of some political ones,
which were understood by all, and apparently
enjoyed. * * *
r "“Imagine,” said Livingstone, talking of
the lion, “ the biggest Newfoundland dog you ever
saw.” We tried to imagine this as we stood before
the cage of felix len, at Chiarini’s; but surely the
traveller must have been poking mild fun at us.
Why. a blow of leo's tail would brain the “biggest
Newfoundland,” &c. To our youthful mind, the
greatest hero of all was that French Zouave, who
—even before rifles, and when the flint-lock pieces
might “ fetch ” a house at 20 yards, but not a door
—used to moon about Algeria o’ nights, and wait
till the brute got within jumping distance—30 feet
or so—wait till the tuft at the end of the lion’s tail
began to waggle preparatory to the fatal spring,
and then plant a bullet over his left eye, with the
certainty of Reid’s having to go up for re-election.
As we stood before the circus cage our admiration
for this loug-defunet Zouave was intensittod.

Joseph an* 1 Stuart Walhalla are described
as “classic artists of the Pancratic school,” and
Mr. Garnett as a “boneless man.” We don’t know
what “ Pancratic ” is. and we don’t want to. What
we do know is that they are three of the cleverest
acrobats we have seen, and we have seen everyone
worth seeing from the Arctic Circle to Patagonia.
• • •
Over Madam Fouente (nie Nellie Reid) the
horsey men of the audience usually get enthusi-
astic. We are not surprised. But the riding on
the whole was a little disappointing, and could be
equalled at many less pretentious places. The
animal, who lent his back for the “ daring acts of
equestrianism,” had a consumptive gallop that
must have taken years to master. The obj urgations
of the saturnine ring-master or the promises of
an extra feed of oats were alike futile in inducing
him to quicken his pace. We may be wrong, but
it struck us that from his back John Lucas could
perform anything we saw done—if hoops large
enough could be procured.
* * * *
We were late for theMajeronis, and found
our seat taken. The fact was, a fx-iend said early
in the morning—“ Bulletin, ray boy, it’s a public
holiday. Let’s go down the harbour and see the
Sydney larrikin, whose sensitive hide you would
preserve from the ‘cat.’” We took the trip and
the rain kept us late, but we saw and heard
enough to know that the Sydney rough is a being
sui generis. “Ah,” said our guide, “’tain’t near
what it was afore you tackled it. There was fun
then.” “But,” we observed, diffidently, “there
was ‘ fun.’ as you call it, to-day.” “ Bah,” he re-
marked (that “bah” crushed us) “if you’d been
here a few years agol ” Well, this is what we did
see. We saw boys of 14 or 16, with villainous faces,
chewing tobacco and squirting the juice over
women. We heard their nameless ribaldry, when
sitting beside young females, who were strangers
to them and apparently modest, but who were
obliged to keep their seats in public conveyances
by land and water. We saw the frightened looks
on the strange girls’ faces at the coarse horse-play
and ready obscenity of the lads. What seemed
oddest of all to us was that the presence of staid,
middle-aged people in large numbers appeared to
have no repressive influence on this infantile
blackguardism. We 'aw all this and a lot more,
and. as the lads wex-e sober and comfortably
dressed, we felt that the roots of ruffianism were
flrmly fixed in the soil, and would require a strong
wrench to be dislodged. There was but one thing
more we wished to see—the parents who bred such
abortions. Could we only get a glimpse of these—
or as many of them as alcohol and vice have left
above ground—we would be content.
• • •
We didn’t mind, ourselves—we lost our
seats, as we deserved. Others lost theirs as well
and didn’t take it half so philosophically. One
lady in particular—a dark, passte, firm-mouthed
one—gave the box-keeper a bit of her mind; and,
if the i-emaining bits are of the same pattern, her
husband must be a man possessed of a good deal
of insight into female human nature, although he
had not appropriated the divided skirts.
• • •
We had been bottling up all our fun for
the Majeronis. Then, we said, we’ll sparkle. The
circus, opera, pantomime, even Zulu himself
never gave us a fair chance. Just wait till the
Majeronis open, and see how we’ll prance in. Well,
they’ve come—we’ve seen them—and there s nary
a sparkle in us. Let us be frank. There are some
things you can’t laugh at. (You see we don’t
mind ending a sentence with a preposition. We’ve
known them to end with a kick before now, and
felt at the time, and for some time after, that
'twas wrong.) When you saw Montgomery as
Hamlet, Creswick as VIrginius, or heax-d Miss
Dai'gon in the “Bridge of Sighs,” you could not
laugh, or, if you could, nothing short of Glades-
ville or a C.M.G.-ship would meet your case.
Again, a thing may be so intrinsically absurd that
mockery cannot reach it. It 1s beyond ridicule.
This was the case with the Fenian attack on
Canada. “Twain” started for the “front” on
the Yankee side of the 8t. Laurence to burlesque
the “invasion,” but when he heard on the road
that a United States’ policeman had driven in a
cab through the ranks of the “invaders” and
collared the commander-in-chief, he turned back
and preserved a morose silence. He felt that any-
thing he could write would fall so far short of the
colossal absurdity of the reality that he decided to
say nothing. And now you guess the reason why
the Majeronis have taken the cork out of the jar
of mirth we had prepared for you.
• • •
So there is nothing for it but to curb our
mercurial nature and settle down for once into
criticism as respectably dull as any of our con-
temporaries, or as that of a country paper when
giving its views on the legitimate drama as illus-
trated by an amateur performance of “ Box and
Cox ” for the benefit of the local hospital.
• • •
“Jealousy” will never become popular.
We mean the play, of course—the thing itself is
popular enough, in the sense of being wide-spread.
u robably everyone born of woman has had a taste
of it at one time or another. But, when you
make one of a crowd who go to hear a great orator
or actor, and when you notice your neighbours
smile when they should sigh, and become suddenly
Interested in the ceiling when they should be in-
fatuated with the stage, the very natural conclu-
sion is that there’s a screw loose somewhere. The
Ioosb screw may be in the piece or the actors or the
audience, but there it is, all the same. Carlo, Mar-
quis of St. Elia, has been brought up as a scholar,
and knows about as much of the usages of society,
or the amount of xascality thore’sin the world, as
a country J.F. of international law—or any other
law, for the matter of that. But he was young,
rich, and good-looking, and the number of good-
looking young women a person possessing those
credentials sees in a day has often been remarked.
They seem, somehow, to come his way. He saw
Diana (Signora Majeroni), and loved. We don’t
wonder at it, for, as she appeared in the piece,
there is probably no man under 70—except a Jew
money-lender—who wouldn’t do the same. They
were married, and she, with the delightful naugh-
tiness of her sex, at once started on a round of
flirtation. And just hero is the proper place to
remark that, if the highest society acts and speaks
as represented, then the French Revolution didn’t
come a bit too soon. We never understood before
why democratic tenets spread so rapidly, but we
do now.
• • *
Well, Carlo was learned and gawky, while
to “Ernest, Count de Rivera,” as to “Bailey,
junior,” every phase of rascality was small print.
That Diana would be “ mashed ” on Ernest, and
that he would send her love-letter , goes without
saying. Carlo, like all sensible men, goes carefully
through his wife’s letters, and (we have not space
for details) challenges the Count, shoots him, tells
Diana what he’s done, and insists—in order that his
own good name and his mother’s happiness should
not be wrecked—that they should live together as
if nothing had happened. There was one unim-
portant stipulation—that they should have separ-
ate apartments. So the play unfolds, showing
how jealousy arose, increased, culminated, de-
clined, and at last ended in forgiveness. Whether
the fault lies with the composer, or translator, or
both, the dialogue is commonplace throughout,
and it requires real talent to secure it from insi-
pidity. The fine voice and fine bearing of Mr.
Glover as General Alphonse de Luca created an
impression more than favourable. The moral
code followed by Duke Riario (Mr. Douglas) was
that of Rouchefoucauld, with a dash or Balzac.
There is a doctor, too (Mr. Brooke), who gives some
useful physiological hints—among others that
every movement of the limbs is attended with
danger, and may result in death. We once knew a
man who thought the same way, so he went to bed
and died from inanition. There are other char-
acters—properly filled, too—which call for no
special mention. The fact is the whole piece is
held together by the Majeronis—their hate, love,
and reconciliation. Their acting is fine—intense.
Why, then, was the representation, so far as its
reception by the audience, a mere mccee d'estime V
We shall certainly know the reason, and shall tell
you. by and bye We would tell you now, but
nave to cut away and look at talent of another
kind—Larry Foley, Miller, and Victor.
As the pantomi me draws to a close, many
of the dresses, paraphernalia, anil accessories show
certain signs or rough nsage. This is very notice-
able with Fe-fl, Fo Fum (so the bills put it), the
Giant’s head. In the tale, it will bo remembered,
that on Jack alone devolves the duty of flattening
it out and chopping it off. But in the pantomime
a number of volunteers—always ready, like larri-
kins, when there is an opening for an unprovoked
assault—lend a hand with palings, domestic
utensils, and other weapons of a more or less
murderous nature. The result is very depressing.
The lines about the mouth are becoming hard and
cynical, while that organ itself is gradually assum-
ing an aspect of unpitying ferocity which wo did
not observe in it during the first week or two. The
eyes are unmistakeably shunted, the hair shows
signs of premature decay, and complete baldndlfe
cannot much longer be deferred. Many of the
more prominent bumps, too—especially at the
back, where the assaults have been most deter-
mined—have given place to depressions of a really
serious nature, which cannot but interfere with
his capacity to pursue a consistent course of
thought or action, and must ultimately lead to dis-
arrangement of the whole system. We have no
desire to cavil with the managers. They know
their own business best. But, in the interests of
humanity, we suggest that, before it is too late,
the unfortunate Fe-fl, Fo Fum be served out with
a cast-iron “nut”: or, if that be impracticable,
that Liveliboi, his flunkey—who appears to enter-
tain the most rancorous feelings towards his
master—be requested to attack him lower down
on the same side, a change which, wc venture to
say, will be equally effective in bringing the Giaait
to reason, while preserving his head from entire
annihilation.
• • •
So much has been said of the Stewarts,
Liddlards, and legs, that Mr. Henry Taylor has been
almost overlooked. This is not fair. His part—
that of Jack’s mother, a “lone widow ”—m less
capable hands might be made simply stupid. In
his, it is funny—genuinely funny. He dances and
sings, makes faces and tumbles as if a world
where he could not make faces and subject the
tenderest parts of his frame to severe contusions
would possess little attraction for him. From a
mediocre part ho extracts all the humour—such
as it is-and by means (extravagant, bizarre, if
you will) of legitimate tomfoolery makes the
young smile and the old demonstrative. The af-
fection for us, as her natural guardian, of the little,
dark-haired, seven-year-old we took with us, on
Saturday night, has sensibly diminished since she
witnessed the vagaries of the “ lone w idow.”
• • •
Oh, and while we think of it—there were
no sausages in the harlequinade I We often
thought the ordinary harlequinade could be im-
proved upon, if only by leaving out Harlequin,
Columbine, Clown, Policeman, and Pantaloon.
This would clear the ground for further omissions.
Even the fish, goose, leg-of-mutton, and chemist’s
shop with abnormal window might be jettisoned,
but we drew the line at sausages. And now they
are gone. Eheu ’
** * *
A good many things pleased us in “Lucre-
zia,” and a few did not. The way the gondola or
schooner was shoved along, showed that the ma-
chinery department was in proper hands, and that
the artist “bossing” it could haul a turret-ship
with equal ease. Then our attention became
riveted on a young lady in front of us, whose
dross behind was so decode tee, that we thought she
had put it on wrong. So all at once flashed u pen
us (we never quite understood it before) the truth
of the Irish servant’s answer, when asked where
his mistress was: “She’s gone up stairs to sthrip
fur dinner.” The voice and style of Signora
Fabris were very noticeable and very nice. Yes,
it is just here—in style we mean—that these foreign
artistes show to such advantage. We have as good
raw material—occasionally better. But we haven’t
their government-subsidised Institutions, so our
people have to pick up their trade how they can,
and as it is distressingly easy to start on the wrong
tack and desperately hard to try back and get on
the right one, it's no wonder so many of our loved
ones become sticks for the Olympians to "guy.”
* ♦ *
But to return. “Lucrezia” is one of those
works that betray a company’s weakness and its
strength. And here, again, it is that foreign dra-
matic and lyrical combinations are, as a rule, so
superior to English. The latter concentrate all
their powers on the leading characters, and give
the subordinate ones to the best material they can
find—generally poor stuff. The former are not
content unless all the parts are adequately repre-
sented. And, now, can’t you see why, when Verdi
trolled out his views, and the squeaky chirrup of
his henchman took up the running, the “gods”
were so “sarcastical,” and an air of hopeless
melancholy settled on the faces of the bald-headed
people in the crowd? It was the Lord Mayor’s
show and the wheel-barrow. We, ourselves, have
been placed in many unpleasant positions in our
struggle against an unsympathising world, but
nothing short of £100 a week, and benefits on
Tuesdays and Fridays, would tempt us, if we were
(we forget his name), to that lyrical tele-d-Ute with
Verdi before a full house.
* • •
Turner aud Miss Montague were satisfac-
tory—especially Annis. In the former’s singing
there’s a good deal of uncertainty. Sometimes,
you stay and listen quite satisfied. At others, you
feel that the transition from the higher chest
notes to the falsetto, is not as smooth as you could
wish.
A short, stout, florid person oame into our
office to-day, save us a familiar punch in the
diaphragm with a flat as hard as a door knob, and
said, while we wore prancing round for wind,
•‘Zulu Thompson’s off to-day, ’gwinotothe Cape,
and then to England. Must ’a made a first-rate
job o’ that ’ere dioratner fake—* gift ’ biz cleverly
worked, I tell you ? ” He then left, but we noticed
that his thumb was close to his nose most of the
time he was addressing us. “ Are you sure he
wont call into He—Helena, St. Helena, on his way?"
we remarked haughtily, for his familiarity and
fist had a little upset us. Mats, ft a rien dit.
♦ ♦ * ♦
And don’t let’s forget to tell you that
Arthur Vivian, the Missus, and Payne, opened the
other night at Mimni—where, in thunder’s Mimnl ?
—and had a great reception ; and so, too, had
Florence Rouse, who played Patience in New-
castle last Monday. Mrs. Inglis was the Lady
Jane, and it will be quite sufficient for
us to state that Mrs. Inglis’ talents were
completely lost in endeavouring to pourtray
such an insignificant character in such poorly
written and feebly scored opera!I! Some one
ought to write Mrs. I. an opera all to herself;
something she could do justice to—something
large, massive, and concrete. We knew a man
who wrote this sort of thing to perfection, once.
However, he died of a kick from a horse; and
the horse died of a broken leg. But no
frivolity. Well, the Auckland papers are
full of Pomeroy. So was Sydney, once. But
Louise is younger now. Miss P. has drawn, in
this trip, more money, so a paper says, than any
star that has ever visited New Zealand. The same
paper says “ Miss Pomeroy’s emotion on the
stage is the real thing, and she dries her eyes
when off the stage, and goes away sobbingly to
change her dress.” We expect Arthur—wo mean
Arthur Pomeroy—is a bit cleverer than we thought
he was. And, it seems Jennie Lee has had a bad
season in Adelaide, her last venture being “ Kind
to a Fault,” and “ The Field of the Cloth of Gold,”
“localised by Mr. F. H. Linklater.” So F>-od.
Harvio has cropped upjagain ! His locals, how-
ever, seem to nave been dismal stuff, and the
burlesque—the best of Robert Brough’s, and the
best, from a literary point |of view, of all bur-
lesques—was a fiasco. Funny, too, they didn’t
like the adaptation from Mullock and Anchovy,
which was so popular here, either. Tommy Hud-
son, however, alter having been burnt out at the
Academy of Music, is doing splendid biz. at
Garner’s Theatre. The Federal Minstrels have
now succeeded the gifted dramatist and “Jo,” at
the Theatre Royal.
* * * *
The Melbourne Herald has been doing
very well lately, over what it is pleased to term
“ exposures.” When our little contemporary went
to the trouble of collecting positive evidence
about certain of the bogus sweeps, it gained a
cheap notoriety, and saved a good many Imbeciles
their golden pound ; but some of its patronising
“warnings” and “exposures” are getting just a
little too much for our gravity. Under the head-
ing of “How the Unwary are Gulled,” the Herald
has once more come to the rescue of Melbourn-
ians, by pointing out to them that a gentleman
recently exhibited in a Bourke-street skittle alley,
as a “ Wild Patagonian Cannibal, who, in his time,
has eaten fourteen missionaries," is nothing less
than a “fraud.” The philanthropic journal then
goes on to state that 33+0 "gullible persons have
thrown away their sixpence admission money,”
but in making this last assertion, from its beauti-
ful elevation of superiority, the Herald is surely
somewhat rough on the public—even though a Mel-
bourne public. The man who pays his modest six-
pence to enjoy a nearty laugh at the expense of a
larrikin “cannibal” —“ fretting at his letters, and
foaming at his keepers, in all his native wildness"—
would be, in nine cases out of ten, far too wise
to be taken in with one of the Herald s
catching “headings.” Were t he people who paid
their money to hear Moncure Conway talk, so
“gullible” as to accept him as “the grandest
intellect in the Southern Hemisphere ?” But the
most amusing part of the cannibal incident comes
when the almighty Herald tells its Melbourne
proUpis that the visit of “our representative”
has resulted in the choslng of the “ show.” The
proprietors of the “cannibal,” it appears, “ad-
mitted everything, and at first seemed to think it
was rather a good joke, until told that there was
such a thing as obtaining money by false pre-
tences, punishable by imprisonment”; then they
realised that “the game was ail up now.” We
trust, therefore, that this energetic journal will
be satisfied with demolishing the wild Patagonian,
and will stay its stern hand for a while. We
admit to rather a weakness for spotted ladies,
living skeletons, seven-ieggod sheep, and prairie
Indians, and should be truly grieved if the Mel-
bourne Herald were to send forth representa-
tives over the whole surface of the globe, exposing
those hitherto unsuspected frauds, and denying
them to the “gullible” public for ever. The
question arises now as to what would be the exact
term of imprisonment required to meet the case
of some of our “ hactors, who plav their roles
with far less fldelidy to.nature than did the “ can-
nibal,” from all accounts.

The last nights of “ Rip Van Winkle ” are
announced at the Melbourne Opera House. It has
run very smoothly, and to uniformly good attend-
ances. A week ago, a successful experiment was
made with the electric light for the purpose of
illuminating the Rhine Fay. But the fairies wili
want to go in for a short study on the great sub-
ject of complexion, if they desire to look as young
as under common gas.
• • •
In the other Melbourne houses, things are
going on as when last noticed. “ Impulse ” is
closing its fourth week, and bids fair to rival “ The
Silver King.” The success of these two dramas
should encourage playwrights to put pieces with
some substance in them on the boards.

Professor Anderson is very enjoyable. He
can read your thoughts now—that is, when you
have any. He hasn’t much material to work on
in this part of his entertainment, but he manages
well. And when 5 he has told a baldheaded man
that he is thinking of an oyster-supper, he cuts a
living lady to pieces and hands round the frag-
ments. There is great diversity in the entertain-
ment, and Louise Maude is a clever assistant.


PEPPER AND SALT.
The world knows little of Its greatest men*
This is the stark-naked truth. Look here. When
Mortimer Franklyn was on the Aon, he was told
to write a paragraph. The editor tore it up.
Mortimer then wrote a loader: waste paper
(basket. He wrote another: pipe-lights. Then
Mortimer paused He bought a cigarette and sat
•down to think. It was hard work. All work is
hard to which we are unaccustomed. But the
heroic typo of man docs not readily yield to diffi-
culties. Mortimer thought. And the result was,
that he wrote a letter, and signed It “ Areericus,"
and it was published. Ha, ha I it was published.
And Mortimer went to the highways, and into the
byeways, and to the market places, and to the
resort of the money-changers, and to other haunts
of sordid man. And he said to everybody—“ Have
you read my letter in the Age?”— and everybody
said “No;” whereat Mortimer button-holed
everybody, and read bis letter to him. And every,
body said “d—n him." Which was not legiti-
mate criticism—was It?

As our readers are aware, our experience
•of the penalties attaching to speaking out plainly
on public matters has been bitter enough; and wo

Emulating the example of our old patriar-
chal “pal,” Watson, Alfred has a long article
announcing the 15th anniver:ary of the Jernle.
Embodied in this fiery, yet plicid sketch, is a
poem—the kind of thing a man wou'd write who
really had a soul above (say) furniture polish.
Here, now, Isa stanza that is eminently pleasing:—
“ The band of trusty liegemen
Of pencil and of pen,
And those fair hands that wield them, too.
To aid us now and then
To fill those bulky pages,
Hath (sic) wrought both well and hard;
And every soldier in our ranks
Has earned our gratitude and thanks —
Artist and scribe and bard!”
Wo think, on this auspicious occasion, we should
V>e wanting lu ordinary journalistic courtesy did
wejnot address a few congratulatory verses to one
who has done so ranch for tho literature of a
young and bounding country: -
Thou’t seen, sweet Alf., the sun of gold
On tho unseen meridian tremble:
And, oft dlds’t thou the moon behold—
Well, by those orbs, wo don't dissemble!
Truth’s mantle’s hero—of virgin white—
In haste wo now proceed to don it;
Believe that we're in earnest quite,
And here is—well—our thumb upon it,
We love, dear All’., thy stanzas sweet.
Whose melody’s as soft as wax is:
To con them’s an clysium treat.
So droll their motif and syntax is!
When, with our little ones at rest,
We love out loud thy verse to stammer.
Those cherubs fair applaud with zest
Each new departure from the grammar!
Sing on, sing on, that Sapph ic stuff
That so adorns thy “ bulky pages;”
The world, p’haps, might grow dull enough
To love thy lays in future ages!
Give thy bards “gratitude and thanks,”
It will afford them endless Joy,
And let them all twang, “ In the ranks,”
The lyre—and munch the sav eloy!
Hang it up, now, over the ham bone.

A now breed of fowls has been introduced
into Parramatta by an enterprising poulterer.
This is an advance in the right direction, for it was
felt by all of us attached to poultry and eggs that
things oould not continue for ever in the old
groove. We have no desire to be severe on the
ordinary domestic fowls which this new breed
promises to entirely supersede. They performed
their work according to their lights, and made the
most of the circumstances in which it had pleased
Providence to place them. Of course, they had
many drawbacks, or else the Wyandottes (the new
breed) would never have obtained a footing
amongst us. Their elementary notions on Incu-
bation, their capacity for keeping up all through
the night a running tire of gossip on the events of
tho day, together with the phenomenal scratrginess
and toughness they develop towards tho turn of
life when phlloprogenltivcness was on the decline
and they found themselves journeying by easy
stages towards the guillotine of a Wynyard-square
hash-house, were some of their more objection-
able traits. On the important subject of incuba-
tion, they never got beyond tho A.B.C. Indeed,
they were born optimists, and, whether sitting on
one of their own eggs, on a triangular junk of
chalk, or on a bladder of lard, they looked to the
future with the same simple confidence. One in-
stance—An extreme one, it is true—is on record
of a Parramatta brahmapootra having roosted
contentedly on the bald head of an elderly person
she saw stretched in the Domain, with a sort of
hazy hope that something might come of it. She
knew not that the owner was a local preacher
attending a Sunday-school picnic. But it is in the
laying branch that the new breed promises some-
thing abnormal. Their power in this department
was evoked by an ingenious stratagem. At Wagga
a poultry-breeder had a nest made with a trap-
door or false bottom. When an egg was laid it
passed through into a basket below, aud the aston-
ished fowl was stopped in her first cackle by dis-
covering that she had done nothing to be proud of.
This induced further efforts, until the basket was
full, and the lion reduced to a bund,'© of feathers.
It was a cruel trick, but has been that
the mother’s peculiarities descended to .tho off-
spring by the well-known law of heredity, so that
now a bogus nest Is no longer necessary. A
crush of matter prevents our alluding to some
other characteristics of the now breed, but we
may again return to the subject.

Old Mr. John Walters, of Blackall (Q.),
had quite a lively time of it the other day, and it
happened thusly. The old gentleman is accus-
tomed to drive into town in a gig drawn by a
patriarchal steed who knows every inch of the
road, and whose morals are of the most unblem-
ished character. On the day in question, this
model moke was in a hotel yard in company with
some others, amongst which was a police charger
that would get up from a meal of quail upon toast
and Quoug Tart’s scones, and run seven miles to
got one fair kick at an Archbishop, and who would
buck himself out of his skin to throw the angel
Gabriel. Itappearsthe Walters’and the constabu-
lary horses were much alike, but here the resem-
blance ended. However, Mr. Walters’ man unfor-
tunately put the harness upon the police horse,
and strapped him in the shafts. Mr. Walters did
not observe the change beyond noticing
that the old horse seemed very fresh this
particular morning, and shaking up the reins,
urged him on the homeward journey. Then the
fun began. Throwing' back his head, and giving
vent to a fiendish laugh, he darted off at the rate
of all-day-before-breakfast; and as a matter of
course, old Mr. Walters and, the gig followed, and
hit up against every stump and fence within a
radius of 500 yards from the proper road. Some-
times the sbandridan would be away up in the
clouds, and its occupant could have enjoyed a
bird’s eye view of half Queensland if ho hadn’t
been otherwise engaged endeavouring to hold on
to the truck with both hands, and to stick to his
hat with the other, and next instant the concern
would be plunged into a yawning abyss as deep as
one of the sections of Dante’s “ Inferno.” Finally,
the runaway stopped short, and old Mr. Walter's
and the gig shot over his head, and came down
keel upwards just in front of him. Hastily re-
versing his poles, the charger started to work with
his heels on the gig; and in ten seconds there was
nothing left of that trap—not even the maker's
name. Mr. Walters owns another man now, and
the trooper is endeavouring to insure his life be-
fore be ventures to do a trial canter on his frisky
little bit of horse flesh.

The Salvation Harmy appears to be
languishing, and a glance at the War Cry loads us
to the conclusion that Major Sutherland is nothing
but a rather dull dog al’t-r all. He is, however,
determined to make a splash ou Anniversary Day,
for he announces what he c ills a “ Fete (sic) Cham-
petre (sic) (whatever that may be), and the advt.
also states that “ Soldiers will form lines, and lire
a grand Jou de-joa*” (sic). Then “ At 5—combined
attack on Commissary Stores, comprising ham,
jam, and sandwiches. Tickets, Is. 6d.” There is
something, to our mind, highly expressive in this
latter announcement. The price charged is also
expressive. As, a matter of fact, the principal
characteristics of the Harmy may be fairly set
down as big drum, rant, tambourine, roars,
triangle, ham, jam, and sandwiches. Without the
money derived from tho sale of goods, and the
receipts from like entertainments, the Sydne ,r
Army would long ere this have been as dead as
Pharoah. Major Sutherland is a capital man of
business. Ho tells the “little soldiers” that
ho has “ a new stock of flageolets at
3s. each,” and we have no doubt they will go off
briskly. The Hallelujah bonnets are, we believe,
sold out; and business must be increasing, because
he wants “a saved young man for office.” In
Melbourne, things are far brighter than they arc
here. They celebrated their anniversary at the
Exhibition recently, and Major Barker announced
that the Harray there had property in the city to
the value of £7000! It seems that the ceremony
was most imposing, for, “after singing, the Rev. A.
Dowie engaged in prayer, and the Converted
Policeman also spoke at ssme length,” the result
being that “ at night the penitent form was a scene
of tears ond groans.” At Balmain, a man got up
to “testify,” and he said: “Brother and tlater,
three weeks ago me and the devil had a fal -
out, and wo ain't made it up yet,” and
be was much applauded. Not s?, however,
an irreverent scoffer, who pretended to guy tho
whole proceedings. Says the paper;—“ The devil
raged, and we tried to cast him out of the man,
but could not, so we cast man and devil out alto-
gether.” Things are pretty rough in Newcastle,
too, it seems, for at one of their meetings “ the
devil was there possessing a being called Skeleton
Cullins, the tool of the publicans.” It is, however,
satisfactory to read that “the converted clown
was with us, and spoke with power.” In a kind of
apologetic whine, in reply to the strictures of her
London critics, Mrs. Booth says:—“We are not
responsible for the ignorance or vulgarity of the
classes whom we seek to benefit.” These are her
own italics. This sentence is “woman” all over.
Of course she's not; but surely the people that
have been sent out here are responsible for the
Ignorance and vulgarity of which they make
so continual a display. Take Mrs. Sutherland,
for instance. We do not accuse her of vul-
garity, being a lady; but it is not too much
to say that in her harangues she does not
construct one single sentence properly, nor in
one instance does she make use of the aspirates
correctly. Then, look at Captain Canty: For an
educated man to look at him is a supplies; and
Captain Reynolds is equally hopeless. Opinions
differ as to the beneficial results derived from the
proceedings of this sensational sect; but if the
world could learn what an ex-Captain of the Harmy
told us recently, there would he very little doubt
whatever on the subject. It is, of course, an edify-
ing spectacle to see great hulking half-drunken
labourers stagger up the room,] and drawing pipes
from their pockets give them with a leer and a
hiccup to the Captain presiding, and take a vow to
smoke no more. Equally edifying is it to see some
poor half-crazy girl, the daughter of respectable
parents, worked up to frenzy by the bands and
singing of the Harmy, fling herself on to the “peni-
tent's form,” and there be taken in hand by the
Hallelujah Lasses—a body of young women who
have, for the chief part, been recruited under very
peculiar circumstances. The lower classes like
onions, and the lower classes like rum; it is not
surprising, therefore, th it many of them should
cotton to a religion that is all rant, tambourine,
roars, and triangle, with the pleasing addition of
ham, jam, and sandwiches.
Since the last number of The Bulletin
fluttered its crimson wings to the breezes, we have
discovered a new poet. A lady, this time, whose
touch of the harp is more “gentle” than ever
Louise’s was. Her chief effort is called “Trip
Down the Coast of New South Wales, from Point
Danger to Cape Howe.” That, we contend, is a
good, honest, straightforward title, with, as Mr.
Sparkler would say, “no bigodd nonsense about
it.” The authoress recited her verses at a Mait-
land concert some time since, being accompanied
on the piano by a younger sister; and, it is stated,
that the young lady’s recitation was received by
the company with no small enthusiasm. Her
powers of versification are considerable; and, it
will be at once seen, that if she has not quite com.
passed the Byronio swing, she has efficiently mas-
tered the shoe-shop stanza. Let us now give some
samples of this poem, which is at once geograpbi-
cal, botanical, and mineral. Mark how conscien-
tious she's:—
“ Shoal Bay is crossed, then Whoman (!) Peak"we
see,
And the Elanie looms in view,
Mount Kibbora, a point, then Crescent Head,
Point Plomer and the Hastings, too. ’
But notice particularly where the fire, long con-
centrated, bursts out in one poetic gush:—
“ For with the Eastern gale theSugarloaf
Is bad to pass; so’s Trcach'ry Head;
But in Port Stephens we are safe enough;
Newcastle next g ives us a bed.”
After this, the poetess seems to have carelessly
cast off, to a large extent, the shackles of rhyme'
and gone in for a kind of bastard blank. For we
read:—
“ By Juggerah Lakes and Broken Bay we run,
With Hawkesbury’s foaming stream,
Then short the trip to Sydney, where you’ll see
such fun
On what most people call the Port.’ [!!I]
One or two more gems are worth setting in
“agate”:—
“ Cape Byron is seen the Richmond near,
Then Double Duke and Clarence force ” (sic).
The last quotation, just to show that the young
singer is not to be beaten for a rhyme:—
“ Then Jervis Bay and George’s Head we double,
Thro’ Sussex Haven, Ulladulla,
To Bateman's Bay, the Clyde, and with some
trouble
We’ll find the blacks a nulia-nulia.*
We are induced to consider this stanza, in point of
metrical construction and poetic skill, almost per*
feet in its way. The manner in which the rhyth-
mical emergency is placidly provided for impresses
us as being beyond all praise. The question is
what is there Impossible to a young lady who can
piece together verses like these? Hardly any
thing. Long ago we knew a juvenile person who
could and did write poetry very much In this
style. Often she would lift her head to the
heavens and sing; and when she wasn’t doing that
she was generally getting spanked for putting
pepper in her grandmother's snuff. As may be
Imagined, the poem, parts of which we have
quoted, is very popular up North, and tbh
authoress’sl family often meet and hold long con-
sultations as to the advisability of “ having it put
in print.” The Vicar on being shown the piece,
said it showed promise, great promise—but he did
not explain what kind of promiso. As he spoke
the words, the rev. gentleman was looking ab-
tractedly in the direction of the lock-up.

Anything cool is acceptable this weather,
and it is, therefore, with a pleasure that borders on
hysteria, that we quote the following irom the
Yookupean Maie;—“The Duke of Edinburgh
will always remain ‘Princ? Alfred’ with colon-
ists in all the colonies which he visited. It was
by that name they first knew him, and they are
not likely to forget it, or to substitute the Duke
of Edinburgh for the old familiar title. It is re-
corded In the annals of the colonies, and in most
of them his natal day is kept by official sanction as
a public holiday. This is familiarly known as
Prince Alfred’s Day. ’ Exactly so. And this re-
minds us that the conduct of our hei'o stands out
gloriously when placed by the side of another
royal “ jook,” who, with three male and extremely
titled friends, spent a night in one of the fiashest
houses that the Aspasias of Melbourne could
afford to raise in honor of their regal guests. A
splendid supper was served at midnight; cham-
pagne flowed ad lib., each guest was crowned with
wreaths, and had scented stuffs poured over his
head, after the old Greek fashion ; professional
singers lent their si Ivory-tongued aid; in fact, it
was a night that old man Belshazzar or Lucullus
might look hack and lie upon with pride; and

That reality is often more wonderful than
the wildest fiction, and that imagination and
romance are frequently in the rear of realizations-
are simple truisms now unshakeably established.
In a smaller degree, our Partingtons and Gamps
are eclipsed by the simple unsophisticated people
we meet in the ordinary routine of our existence.
An honest selector, up in North Queensland,
assured us very earnestly, and repeated it for
emphasis, that he “believed the best kind of
mango was one as was ‘injudicious’ to New
Guinea.” There is, or was, a good old farmer on
the Clarence named David Kirk, better known as
“Davy Kirk,” and we can remember this genial old
agriculturist had a wild, unbridled propensity
for words of five or six syllable®, and used to heave
them in to till vast vacuums in his dis-
course without the slightest regard whether
they bore any relation to anything which came
before or anything that followed after. Many
years ago, now, he was dining at llocky Mouth,
and old Davy was scattering chain-shot English
round in a death dealing shower, tho result of an
unusually close application to the study of Web-
ster unabridged and unabridgable. The discussion
turned on theology and Scotland’s early reformers.
Davy wound up his version of the argument with
the following conclusive verdict: “ In any orni-
thological mystery of this Mesopotamian descrip
tion, where the triangulation of the human intel-
lect has nothing to do w,th It, moreover, it must
be si-en that John Knox, however great bis
predestination, was not a subtraction on the ven-
triloquism of the Apostle Paul.” This is abso-
lutely a vcrbnti’/i report. After the delivery of
this terrific peroration, Davy looked round in
triumph, to find his paralysed audience with their
noses In their teacups and their bosoms heaving
convulsively.

About ten thousand miles from Cairns, a
young Primitive Methodist parson, “ as smooth as
Hebe’s his unrazored lips," was visiting at the
house of a sugar-planter, about as irreverend and
sacriligious an iconoclast as modern scepticism has
produced. Like most young men of this class of
parsons, the one referred to is not distinguished by
educational gifts or the colossal character of his
intellect; and when the planter, in a sardonic spirit
of fun, started a profoundly incomprehensible
dissertation on a new transcendental theory of the
Infinitesimal Calculus, and asked the parson for a
true explanation according to the genuine theo-
pneustic refrangescent process of reasoning, the
youthful preacher of the Gosp«l simply sat and
gazed at him with that awe-struck amazement with
which a Swiss traveller watches the descent of a ter-
rific avalanche. When he recovered consciousness,
he smiled in a vacant sort of way, and said he felt
tired and would like to retire to rest. When the
planter escorted him to his room, he meekly
asked If he “could have a night-dress?” The
planter said “ Ob, certainly,” and started for
the necessary garment. The planter s mother-
in-law lives in the house, and in mistake his
wife handed him one of the old lady’s night-
dresses, neatly folded up. The error was dis-
covered soon after, but the planter sternly forbade
any alteration In the prog ramme. Then the wife
and the mother-in-law and the governess met in
general consultation, and they were, of course,
overheard by the “ lady assistant ” in tho kitchen.
This enterprising female was acquained with some
secret chink through which she could command
a fair view of the. interior of the parson's room,
and with the enterprise of her particular sect,
posted herself at the available loop-hole to watch
and announce proceedings. The subsequent re-
port of this “ Select Committee ” of one revealed j
that tho reverend youth had duly enclosed his j
sacred-form lu the mother-in-law’s nightdress, 1
which was decorated from top to bottom with a
display of lace, and frills and ruchings, and various
other gorgeous decorations of the milliner’s art,
until it looked like a prize specimen in the needle-
work section of an Industrial Art Exhibition.
Arrayed in this dazzling robe, the Primitive
Apostle looked like a Parisian bride dressed for
the bridal chamber, and he stood for some time
before tho mirror surveying himself in speechless
and overpowering admiration. About this period
all the ladies of tho house had retired to the far
end of the garden to open the safety-valves of a
suppressed hilarity, under a pressure of a thou-
sand pounds to a square inch, and the lady assis-
tant was wrestling with cacchinatory convulsions
at the back of the kitchen. After breakfast next
morning, when the Apostle was bidding the
planter good-bye, his last words were, “ I have no
doubt there is a great future for the sugar induf-
try, and that you planters will become men sur-
rounded by wealth and luxury. Why, even now,
the very cost of one of your beautiful night
dresses would buv a whole suit of clothes tor a
poor clergyman 1” Thus do the meek and lowly
followers of the Naz irene become subjects of un-
hallowed mirth tor the ungodly and the unre-
generate.

You’ve seen the French in the newspapers
—“ recherche , diner a le ruse” &e, Well, it is never

The old saw that “ Love of money is the
root of all evil” must not be regarded as uni-
versal in its applicability. In the case of Wesleyan
ministers, for instance, it doesn’t apply at all; and
at the Wesleyan Methodist Conference held in
Melbourne, the president, Rev. Henry Bath, gave
us some valuable information on this point. In
the course of his inaugural address, the Rev. Bath,
after discussing the spiritual affairs of their
Church, went on to say, “ Besides others, there
was the financial Interest, which was regarded by
some as the chief interest. In this the ministers
had a share, and he would say that those who gave
their lives to the church had a right to claim that
their financial rights should be preserved. [Why,
cert’nly.- Ed. B.] . . . They sometimes were
accused of a love of money, but, in the manner
they loved it, it was a harmless passion.” For the
wealthy layman, then, who may bo developing
too pronounced a fondness for the “root of all
evil,” a ready opportunity presents itself of getting
rid of bis temptation without shifting the respon-
sibility of it on to anyone else. He has only to “ go
to Bath ” with his superfluous lucre.
THE HARMLESS PASSION,
Love of money of all evil
Has been often termed the root,
Planted in us by the Devi 1 ,
To bear bitter, sinful fruit:
The most dark of his devices.
The parent of our crimes,
The groundwork of our vices.
Parsons call it, oftentimes.
But of quite a different fashion
Is a p arson’s love of gold—
’Tis with them a “ harmless passion ’’
(As we’ve recently been told);
And they merely take temptation
From such sinful men sis you.
When they ask remuneration
For the holy work they do.
So come forward with your “pieces,”
Let your “church subscriptions” flow;
For your money always ceases
To be “ evil’s root,” you know.
When it passes to the parsons,
Since for them (as wo suppose)
Gold those Sacred Gates unfastens,
Which to laymen it would close.

There was a friend of ours; he’s dead;

And that's the reason that he’s dead.

From the Cumberland Independent we
learn that a poet has called on them—a live poet
who has shone in these pages. It must be some
mistake. Our poet is under lock and key in the

drop across a poet, wc don't turn him out to
browse around Parramatta. We place him under

bottle in the other. The copy is lowered down to
the printing room with one line, and the bottle to
a handy boy who receives it at the back window
by another. Ho knows his duty.
They’re gradually growing to be a mighty

station horse, ran him back to the stockyard, tied
him to a rail by the wrists, beat him unmercifully
with a stick, and left him, bruised and bleeding,
tied to a rail, under a burning sun, from ” p m.

A writer on “insanity” in the Popular

that he has never given the OT ifc five shilling s and
helped to bundle the baby into the tram, so as to
have a quiet day to write comic paragraphs; and
as, moreover, it is further probable he has not
been knocked up by live people asking if the next
house is to be let, or by thirteen Chinese hawkers
and twilve sewing-machine men wc may excuse
his putting down the above as a delusion. If he
has suffered this, be sure he has ’em again.
The Parramatta Fergy talks of the
“vulpine ravages of the Plying Gang,” and says
that—if society is to be preserved— “ there [is no-

will be effectual in accomplishing it either end.”
Which end ? The end which sits on kerbstones,
we should suggest. But why the “ tlyiug gaug '! ”
If it were possible to be serious with Fergy, we
should respectfully point out to him that to per-
petuate in print such titles as these young black-
guards may choose to give themselves, is to them
a glory which spurs them on to fresh ruffianism.
Fergy might have seen the effect of this mistaken
policy of the press with regard to certain members
of Parliament.
The Herald had a very funny par. the
other day about a web-footed platypus, sent from
Mudgee to Mr. Walter Bradley, for presentation
to the Zoological Garden. The Herald gravely
states that its “ears are internal.” Well, when-
ever did we see a morning newspaper conductor
with ears elsewhere. And “instead of a snout it
has a bill.” Not that only—“ Its feet are webbed,
and have claws for boring.” This is the first real
platypus that hasn’t been known to bore with his
pen. And now for the most important item. “ It
is likely that many visitors will be attracted by
the platypus before it is put into its little pond,
when of course it will burrow, and be only occa-
sionally seen.” Then our little friend is also a
politician. “ Now’s the time for disappearing,”
&c.
Mr. Charles Rice, of Melbourne, is not a
man we are disposed to favour. We don’t, in fact
know him. You can look all through the cards in
the soup-plate on our parlour table and we are
certain you will not find his pasteboard. By trade
a tailor, Mr. R., it seems, had some words with his
good lady relative to her going out, and upon her
insisting on taking a walk. Mr. Rice hit her over
the head with a billet of wood, and knocked her
down. When down he hit her again, and kicked
her, and cn his daughter coming to the rescue he
took a turn at her with the billet, with the result
that she was seriously injured and her mothtr
kil'ed. Rice is now in custody, and there is a feel-
ing abroad that he will be hanged. This is pos-
sible, of course, but we don’t think he will be
hanged. His case, vou will find, will, in the first
instance, be taken up by Dr. Singleton—dear old
patriarch—and then other rev. gentlemen will
become interested in the criminal, and his ‘ peni-
tent frame of mind ” will be talked about, his
“ deep contrition ” will be noised abroad, and then
the evening papers will have little pars., in which
ho will be made to say—“Oh, God. how could I
have killed ray darling wife? it seems like a hor-
rible dream! ” or, “raising his head, wearily, from
his cell table,” he said, in a weak voice—“ Is my
sweet child getting better?” or, “the prisoner
passes the whole of his time in prayer, and says,
when spoken to by the priest (who has been unre-
mitting in his attentions to the unfortunate man)
—‘ There is no earthly hope. I am prepared to
wing my flight to where the stars shine, and the
moon sheds around her holy glow.” No; we don’t
say that Mr. Charles Rice will be rewarded; but he
will certainly not be hanged. You will see.
Alfred Duneen, Esq., is in a bit of trouble
just now, and serve him right. He was an am-
bitious youth, and tried to settle a constable with
a pea-cartridge revolver. He is only seventeen, it
is true, so probably he did not guage the difficulty
of killing a policeman. He fired six shots or so
into {Constable Hodgkinson, but the result was
only to put that officer (he was unknown before)
in an interesting situation, and now he is as well
as may be expected. The constable, after thus
having had his weight increased by several ounces,
was enabled to lucidly give his evidence, and it is
openiv stated that he will be on the block shortly
We sincerely hope so. Our business, however, is
to point a moral. That moral is: Never try to kill
a policeman. There is every chance against its
coming off, and really little to be gained by it.
Directly you knock down one ten-pin—we mean
constable—another is set up in his place, and, per-
haps, one whose molars are ornamented with
auburn curls, and who (being just out) is Imbued
with the idea that to bang you over the head with
his truncheon, and afterwards run you in for
assault, is one of the neatest little jokes on record.
Why. in Hongkong, where the policemen, being
Sepoys, are impervious to powder and ball, they
use as many as three a day at one corner, at times,
when the mercantile marine and the navy happen
to differ about something.
We received, the other day, a copy of the
Narrabbi Herald, and after a glance at its
leader on local option, immediately gave it in
charge for drunkenness. We understand that the
authorities charged it subsequently with disor-
derly conduct, and with tearing a policeman’s
uniform. One paragraph will convince the reader
that the paper in question had no alternative but
to plead guilty and urge mental aberration in
mitigation of punishment. A sample “ We pre-
sume the gentlemen who go in for such ultra
measures as Local Option, which would be in their
estimate of its entirety ensure perfect alcoholic
(vie) I absence to the vulgar public in their vicinity,
would hardly like a measure of the same descriptioH
carried with regard to the buildings erected on
their land, how far from the road [!], ard when
the lights of the establishment should be put out
[! !]; or, as some who possesses wholesale spirit
licenses should be restricted as to t e size and
nature of the building in which they carry on
their trade, and in this, the latter case, would be
just as applicable as the former.”
The paragraph, behold, is— sic.
Our word you mast not doubt it;
There seems to be •» lot of “ Me,”
Or let’s say “ hock,” about it.

Mr. Sharp’s Gaiety Hotel.
Reference was casually made in last week’s
Bulletin to the first-class style in which Mr,
James Sharp, of the Gaiety Hotel, retails draught
and bottled liquors at his hotel. This is a matter
of public Interest, when every day comes up the
statement of the retailing of inferior liquors.
And it is creditable to find that not only in this
respect has Mr. Sharp effected a desirable change,
but he has appreciably improved the whole char-
acter and appearance of the hotel. Mr. Sharp
first gave the public a taste of his capabilities as
an hotel manager by the style in which he raised
to a first-class position his house at the corner of
King and Oastlereagh streets And now there is a
further proof in this direction, at the Gaiety
Hotel. Most people know that this is one of the
best properties in Sydney, being very commodious
and lofty, standing in a splendid position. Well,
for years, it had an indifferent appearance;
but since coming into Mr. James Sharp’s
hands the public have proof of what a
firm system of management will do in
ref Coring a hotel business; and, as there is nothing
from which the public suffer more than a badly-
managed hostelrie of this description, there must
b3 corresponding credit due to Mr. Sharp and his
estimable wife for making their house one of the
best in the city. On Mr. Sharp purchasing the
hotel, he undertook very extensive repairs, and
spent a large sum of money in decorations—which
completely changed the whole features of the place.
Then the public bar was reconstructed in fine style,
and two private bars were added, which have
proved a boon in the neighbourhood. The wall
and ceiling decorations, which were all hand-
painted, surpassed anything of the kind elsewhere
seen in the city. And Mr. Sharp backed up these
improvements by raising the standard ©f the
quality of his liquors—procuring the very best
that can be retailed at ruling prices. There is no
mistaking the thoroughness of this part of the
business. And, with regard to one item of large
consumption—the Waverley pale ale—no house in
Sydney surpasses the Gaiety in the way it retails
its silver tankards of this splendid brew. It may
be mentioned that the propi letors of the Waverley
Brewery recently presented Mr. Sharp with a
valuable silver trophy in recognition of the success
which attended his retailing their ales. Mr.
Sharp looks to the whole arrangement of his
cellars and bar pumps, and the public are recog-
nising the result. The interior arrangement of
the Gaiety gives every accommodation to families
and others on a visit to Sydney, this part of the
house being under the special supervision of the
amiable hostess. The bed rooms are lo ty and
well furnished and ventilated: and in addition to
several acceptable parlours, there is a fine spacious
balcony. Added to this, is the situation of the
hotel, immediately alongside Hyde Park, and near
the tram station —and it will be at once seen that
Mr. Sharp has not made a bad investment in secur-
ing an hotel which admitted of being made one of
the best hostelries in Sydney.
Good Health in Hot Weather.
It is a very certain fact—and one that ought to be
recognised by every householder in the colony—
that the use of pure Island limejuice is of the
highest benefit to health in this climate, and par-
ticularly at ( this time of the year. In the South
Sea Islands, the lime trees produce fruit in im-
mense quantities, and from these limes the natural
juice is extracted by the natives and others in the
simplest fashion. The extract is gathered at
the various ports by the trading vessels, and
hence finds Us way into the Sydney market.
Messrs. H. S. Bird and Co., Macquarie-place,
were among the first to open up a real good
market for this valuable product. They receive
the Jimejuice in quantities of fOUO to 5000 gallons
at a time, in bottles and casks—disposing of it in
wholesale and retail quantities to the trade and
general public. Householders largely avail
themselves of this opportunity to maintain a
standard of health in their families, obtaining the
limejuice in from f-gallon kegs to 100-gallon casks,
thus making certain of the purchase of the genu-
ine Island product. The consuming public should
remember that there is a manufactured limejuice
—the product of acids—but there is also the
genuine Island limejuice-the simple product of
the fruit—which can be obtained, as stated, at
Bird and Co's. Orders are despatched to any part
of the colony.
City Hotel Improvements.
A complete and very creditable change has been
made Dy Mr. T. Carter in the hotel premises at the
corner of George and Park streets. For years the
place has been known as the Town Hall Hotel, but
its management was nothing out of the way till
Mr. Carter took it m hand. He started with ex-
tensive alterations, by which the appearance of
the whole place, both inside and outside, has
been completely changed. A spacious verandah
constructed of ornamental ironwork was carried
round the two street fronts, while mside an ex-
tensive and splendidly-lighted bar was made, with
three entrances from the street. Running round
the bar is a tlrst-class counter, and between that
and the wall there is a clear six feet of space. The
liquors are ranged in handsome shelving, and the
beer pumps are the very best procurable. The
walls are ornamented with the brightest silver-
stamped paper, producing an excellent effect.
At the rear of the public bar is a second
one mo e private in its arrangements — but
there is the same tariff of charges with
the one as with the other. This neat little bar is
furnished with tables, &c., where a quiet half-
nour can be passed at any time. The point of the
business is the tlrst-class character of every drop
of wines, brandies, whiskies, ales, \c. supplied in
bottle or glass—and the immense business done
day by day is proof that the public recognise the
fact already. One particular line which Mr.
Carter has imported for his own exclusive use is
the Glenshiel whisky, over seven years of age—a
brand that is bound to command a big trade. The
Glenshiel has a beautiful aromn, soft and round,
and is retailed, even in the glass, in really first-
class condition. With this one line alone, Mr.
Carter is attracting to his house a class of cus-
tomers who have probably for years never paid a
visit to the hotel. Mr. Carter is an enterprising
young fellow who well deserves to succeed.
The stewards of the Canterbury Race
Club, whose first meet was held the other day, are
resolved to make their annual meet one of the
events of the sporting season in N.S.W. Which
fact here mentioned leans to a vindication of the
catering by T. Crlpps at the opening meeting. It
was known, but too lato for remedying, that the
accomodation for luncheon was whoilv Inade-
quate. Yet, notwithstanding this difficulty,
Mr. Cripps, who was charged with the catering,
undertook to meet the demands. The pressure
was probably greater than had ever been experi-
enced under similar circumstances, yet the public
were well served. Some may have experienced a
crush, and been unable to obtain supplies, and
thus originated the unjust statement that the pro-
vender and the liquors supplied by Cripps on the
occasion were not Al. This Mr. Cripps stoutly
denies on a sworn affirmation, and speci-
fies the liquors supplied ; the lot included
the very best brands of clarets, champagnes,
and other wines, the best brands of whis-
keys and orandies, end English ales and por-
ters. The liquors were supplied to Mr. Cripps’
order by Messrs. A. Thompson and Co., wine and
snirit merchants, Pitt-street, whose cellars and
stores have enjoyed for years as high a reputation
for excellence us those of any other house in
Sydney. The best proof of Mr. Cripps’ success on
this occasion is that the stewards now want him to
undertake the contract for same years to come.
This simple little fact is an answer to all carping*
and must be gall to the disappointed catering ira-
ternity who originated the false report.

An effort is being made to draw out Miss
Veitch, the Ararat elocutionist. We are not par-
tial to lady elocutionists, as a rule. The sweet,
low voice fetches us better. But Miss Veitch has
a call. And she throws ever so much ability about
the house. A meeting was held last week In the
Melbourne Town Hall to encourage her. A large

Miss Sella Guerin, whose portrait we pub-

take the degree of Bachelor of Arts at the Mel-

Zealand and Tasmania are offering her appoint-
ments at big figures. But she likes Ballarat. And
the Ballarat School of Mines wants her to stay
there and instruct the young ladies in languages.
We’ll be sorry if she puts her heart into school-
teaching. We hope she’ll be dragged at once into
matrimony. What are the men of Ballarat think-

One Captain Samson, in England, took the.
Northern Farmer’s advice, to “go where munny
is.” But he got into sore trouble, for the money
belonged to a ward in chancery, and on marrying
her he was at once jugged for contempt of court.
After four months of seclusion, the unhappy
bridegroom offex-ed to make a most humble sub-
mission and apology to the court—which, seeing
he had the ward safe, and the ward had the money,
he could well afford to do. But His Honor inti-
mated that he considered his “ contempt not yet
purged,” and declined to release him. In England,
as here, “ contempt ” is still punishable by incar-
ceration for such time as the caprice or the diges-
tion of the judge may dictate. And that’s the
reason why if we were single again we would never
marry a rich ward in chancery. For Sir James
would consider it necessary to wait till the Trum-
pet Blast to purge us.
“Looksley”—is that our old friend Tasma?
—writes a couple of columns to the Abgus on
Pretty Tasmanians.” She maintains they are as
nice as ever they were, despite the malicious earp-
lugs of some critics. We believe they are. But,
after all, the canons for judging what is a lovely
woman are very unsettled. It seems to us that
the critic’s age has a great deal to do with the sub-
ject. At 16, he is sure to believe that lovely
woman is round, fat, and fully forty years of age.
At 30, he thins her down, and makes her about 30.
At 30, he comes to feel that her loveliness is
supreme at 30. At 60, he rubs the top of his bald
head, and feels his heart wrecked at the vision of
sweet, dimpled 16. At 80, the old lad lies back and
with eyes closed, dreams of the perfect loveliness
of darling 14, The critic’s last state may be as bad
as his first, but he is about as good au authority on
the question at the extreme periods as in any of

There is a reaction, gentle reader, in
favour of the old-fashioned feminine limb liga-
ture. when we were very young, which means
very many years ago. there was an uprising
against the g * rt * r. At that time it consisted of
a more or less elastic band, worn above or below
the k * ee. As a st ♦ ck * ng supporter, it was
only a partial success. On a not plump 1 * g, its
tendency was towards the * nkl *, On a limb of
excentno architecture, its progress downwards
was sometimes arrested by some unexpected dip,
or angle, or prominence. On a full, symmetrical
girl pedestal, it stopped the circulation. It was
discovered that a tight band was the source of
bay l ere J' bad teeth, kleptomania and
cacoethes scribendt. So it was, metaphorically,
dropped, and after a prolonged howl for some-
teing hygienic, reform introduced the suspender,
which we are given to understand is an elastic
affair, of which one end fastens to the c *rs * t
and another to the st*ck* ng. This has had a
long enough reign to allow of about three hun-
dred inventors each making a handsome fortune

of the common button and button-hole at either

But, after a season of popular favour, it is now
found by inquiring savants that the suspender is
the certain cause of dyspepsia, big feet, backache,
heartache, bunions, blushes, and blues. In fact
it is impossible to calculate the dreadful pofsibili-
ties of this apparently innocent article of harness,
so tnab—and this brings us to what we wanted to
say ladies are now taking to perfumed, poetic,
pale-tinted pairs of elastic circlets, studded with
costly jewels.
This is our own translation, and our
paraphrase. The original was written a couple of
thousand years ago, in a jargon which Miss Bella
Guenn win tell you is called Latin. Catalina wrote

make it look very small. That’s our experience,
te°- A keg every three months. But Catullus
was not only a sweet poet; he was also wicked. It
adds greatly to a poet’s fame if he can be wicked, j
Sladen isn t wicked—which is a pity. If Sladen
could grow wicked, then you’d hear genius. What
matter about the lock-up? Surely you don’t mean
tnat a poet is to dam his flowing soul, and put a
rag over his rolling- eye, merely because you nave
an old lock-up i We hope these remarks have led
you round to take in good part our rhymed para-
phrase. Fou will just sit back, taking care not to

it on the waxen tablets of your memory, and will

The plantation of Catalpa trees at Coota-
mundra is progressing splendidly. The tree, which
is native to American soil, is of great size, is
impervious to damp, and has remarkably vigor-
ous growth. Its timber is specially suited for
bridge-building and for railway sleepers. The
Minister for Mines, who recently inspected the
plantation at Cootamundra, intends having the
catalpa extensively planted in other suitable parts
of the colony.
A Hunter’s Hill resident'complains lo us
that at a meeting convened by the Mayor there
to get public baths at the foot of AJexandra-
street, some affluent gentlemen, possessing com-
fortable baths of their own, objected to the erec-
tion of public ones because such would be, with
the aid of a telescope, within sight of their fami-
nes. It seems to us it is one of those cases where
people who are well off might think a little of
others who are not. Sharks render open bathing
dangerous ; and il is hard if the mass population
of a waterside suburb are to be debarred from
having public baths unless there is some stronger
reason than that above given. Families, we would
gently suggest, need not look through telescopes
unless they feel compelled to; and as far as any
panorama of unadorned nature is concerned, we
are assured that the tig urea in the private baths
are not absolutely Invisible to any one who hap-
pens to go by at the hour they are occupied. We
iloa t like selfishness.
The principles of primitive Christianity
approve themselves to every disinterested reaso-
ns o? d „ are, . 1 5 facfc ’ a s night be expected, intui-
tive in eyerj bosom. Perpetually obscured and
corrupted by human selfishness, pride, and hypo-
crisy, those principles nevertheless constantly
struggle for recognition. Theology—that deadly
foe of religion—is constantly in need of reforma-
tion. Savonarola was one of the earlier reformers.
The wprld was not quite ripe for him Then, as
the universal sense of mankind revolted against
tne corruptions and hypocrisy of an age which,
while professing Christianity, belied its every pre-
cept, the series of protestors, Huss, Luther, Calvin,
struck a note which found a far-reaching echo.
Then Protestantism itself began to corrupt, and
reformer succeeded reformer. Parties of sectaries
pledged to simpler and more primitive practice
came into existence : Puritans, Quakers, Wes-
leyans. Wesley and w hitfield were conslder-
able reformers. But they have been some

vvmtheld was denounced on exactly the grounds
U P° S R which Canon Shuttleworth, a minor canon
or st. Pauls, is now being abused in England.
Canon Shuttleworth, with a little handful of
Church of England clergy, has taken to preaching
,u 8t i an socialism, and among the coiruptly
orthodox a yel' has been raised, just as if the prin-
ciples of primitive Christianity and the principles of
socialism were not identical. The orthodox accu-
sation against Whitfield has been preserved for us
by melding, who puts it into the mouth of Parson
Barnabas, in a disputation with the single-
minded Parson Adams, it is worth reproduc-
if 1 ? j U8 t Pow; —“ Sir,” said he, turning to
Adams, this fellow’s writings are levelled
at the clergy. He would reduce us to
the example ot the primitive ages, forsooth. . . ,
He pretends to understand the Scriptures literally,
and would make mankind believe tuat the poverty
and low estate which was recommended to the
Church in i's infancy, and was only a temporary
doctrine, adapted to her under persecution, was
to be preserved in her flourishing condition. Sir
the principles of Toland, Woolston, and all the
freethinkers, are not calculated to do half the
mischief, as those professed by this fellow and his
followers. These objections to Whitlield would
serve exactly to define the objections against
canon Shuttleworth and his colleagues, and also
against a Homan Catholic monk, Father Gerard
who just before the last mail left, preached in
London; some of his questions and home-thrusts
at professing Christians, whose daily pratice was
in open contradiction to their creed, were so
direct and pointed as to have seemed almost sai-
haiut - le / n °u b S en iinged with infinite
Christian chaiity, the preacher declared
m effect, was no “will-o’-the-wisp,” no beautiful
theory to bo reverenced In the abstract, but a
command to be put into daily pratice. Then came
. P.'-eacher s quick question ; Do professing
Christians in our day aet up to this commandmenr
which is not optional, but absolute ? Do they visit
the sick, teed the hungry, clothe the naked ? If
they did, ne went on, this world of ours would bo
sometmng quite other from what it ls~a world of 1
sorrows and sufferings unheeded and unaided. I
This is quite as shocking as was Whitfield: and 1

One of the holiday sights of Saturday was
the procession of the Lumpers. The participants
met at Miller’s Point, where streamers of bunting
and numerous banners waving in the breeze
betokened that the people were in accord with the
holiday makers. It was the gala day of the wharf-
lumpers. and they formed Into line about 1500
strong, headed by a splendid band. Their hand-
some banner was upheld by four stalwart mem-
bers of the Union, and was followed by the presi-
dent of the society (Mr. B. W. O’Sullivan) sporting
the blue and white of the society and seated in a
buggy. Then came about 300 robust-looking men,
and behind them a gorgeous-looking triumphal
car, on which, under a canopy of dags, stood
Neptune, Amphitrite, Venetian gondoliers, and
seamen of the Armada period. Sir Francis Drake,
and other characters, all in appropriate costume.
Then came about 1300 more stalwart lumpers, who,
like their comrades in front, wore blue rosettes.
Throughout the procession were scattered the
dags of all nations and a number of other banners,
while on the outside of the rank walked the com-
mittee, wearing white and blue rosettes. The
whole formed as unique and pretty a sight as was
ever seen in the streets of Sydney, and redected
great credit upon the designer of the show. As
the men walked along the streets they vocifer-
ously cheered, and were followed by an immense
crowd. At every available door or window were
groups of men, women, or children, who answered
the cheers with waving of handkerchiefs and
dags. The whole scene was redolent of good
feeling and enthusiasm, and indicated that the
participants therein were having real enjoyment.
The enjoyment did not end here for the
lumpers, for they proceeded to Chowder, ac-
companied by about 3000 of their friends,
and celebrated the holiday in a right joyful
manner with sports and pastimes of all descrip-
tions. Only one member of Parliament intruded
himself upon them—the duent member for West
Sydney—but he soon quitted the scene when he
found that he was not taken notice of. Nothing
else occurred to mar the day’s proceedings, and
the lumpers and their friends returned to their
homes, after a demonstration which redected the
highest credit upon them individually and collec-
tively. Labor omnia vincit, and it is to be hoped
now that they have demonstrated their vitality
and strength, the wharf lumpers may work in
unity and peace with their employers, and give us
many another such celebration.
The handkerchief which is perfumed with
MURRAY & LANMAN’S FLORIDA WATER
yields more enjoyment to its possessor than would
a bouquet of dowers, because the latter fade,
decay, and become offensive, but the Florida
Water remains fresh and delicious, unaffected by
the lapse of time.

SOCIAL.
The consecration of their new Hall created
great interest among: the Freemasons; it was, we
believe, the most fluttering’ event that has yet
in the history of tin colony agitated the mystic
brethren. The hall is a noble building, completely
titled, in Castlereagh-street. near the cornet of
Goulburu-street, and quite gives a high tone to
the locality. The locality wants it. Hundreds of
Masons, from all over this colony and others,
gathered in full regalia, and marched at 3 o’clock
to Christ Church for sermon and service. As
nearly ah wore full evening dress, belltoppers,
white ties and gloves, the procession up George-
street was a sight most unusual. And as the sun
was scorching not and the march aggravatlngly
slow, the perspiring Masons must have been
heartily glad it was unusual. Meantime, at the
hall, visitors—some Masons, some not—crowded in,
until the gallery and main floor were (Hied. Below,
ladies sat facing one another in long rows or
chairs, with a few male spectators scattered at in-
tervals among them, and they waited from 3 till
4 o’clock. We don’t disguise the fact; it was dull.
Some good music was given by Messrs. ,T. Massey
and C. B. Foster, Hallewell, Johnson, Peir, and
Gordon. The vocalism was appreciated, but the
solter parts of the piano claying were indistinctly
heard. All the time, Brest artists were busily
sketching the scene from various points. Some-
how or other, a vague rumour spread that the
ladies were to be regaled with Ice-cream and coffee,
but the idea gradually grew fainter and fainter. So
did the ladies. Soon after four, the procession
returned, and the ceremony of consecration went
on, consisting of a Bible reading (being portion of
Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple),
addresses and responses, marching and hymns,
and sprinkling of corn, wine and oil on the ‘Lodge’
or Ark. All the brethren wore full regalia. Mr.
Farnell’s speech was a capital one: it was interest-
ing, and put clearly the little matter of variance
between the N.S.W. and English lodges. It was
road from manuscript. Masonic applause is pecu-
liar; it consists of one thump on the floor with a
rod, only one. It was nearly six o’clock when the
formalities concluded, and strangers then retired.
Many ladies wore good average costumes, but the
display of millinery on the whole was not'remark-
able. In the evening the Grand Master of N.8.W.,
Mr. J. 8. Farnell, gave a banquet at the Oxford
Hotel to Victorian Masons. Grand Master Mr G.
8. Coppin, spoke at some length, and hoped to see
a similarly tine Masonic Hall soon dedicated in
Melbourne. On Thursday, Dr. Tarrant invited a
number of Masons to a harbour trip in the steam
launch Nea. They visited the Vernon, Ryde,
Qladesville, and landed at Circular Quay, at 5 p.m.
That night a grand ball occurred, of which wc
give a separate account. On Friday evening at the
new hall, the Grand Lodge of N.S.W. gave a ban-
quet, over 100 being present, including Grand
Masters Farnell and Coppin; and vocalists and the
Young Australian band provided music. On fa-
turday there was a picnic, nearly 300 ladies and
gentlemen starting in the Ajax at 11 a.m. They
went up the Parramatta River, down to Manly,
and, in fact, nearly everywhere, the band playing,
corks popping, couples dancing merrily. A few
speeches over a Compagnoni luncheon, endless
quailing of champagne, and return to Sydney
about 5 o’clock. All through the festivities of this
great Masonic outbreak, the Grand Secretary, Mr.
Nicholas Weekes, was a most able manager, audit’s
fair to say he provided an almost unparalleled
weekes dissipation.
Sladen-like, we string together
Words with little you know;
Write them lightly, with a feather.
Not to give offence, you know.
Telling how the Masons merry
Kan their opening ball so gay,
Everything was “grand,” and very
Pleasant was the hall so gay.
Pleasure helped the hours to hasten.
And, you bet a dollar on.
Many a maid as well as Mason
Had a little “ collar ” on.
And, in corners cool and lonely.
Many a one there handy is;
Talcs were told, to one ear only.
Sweeter far than candy is.
Oft-times in the lancers’ chain.
Lest the dear girl slip, you know,
Charles Adophus presses Jane
With Masonic “ grip,” you know.
Tom says that May’s eyes divine
Are lakes that Love goes fishing in.
May gives Tom some secret “ sign,”
With much earnest wishing in.
Round the door, for all to see.
Safe from whore the “crashers ” are,
With a look of bored ennui.
All the gentle mashers are.
Lightfoot maidens skim the door.
Light we’d have this jingle be,
Makes us wonder more and more
How men still can single be!
Those who’d Beauty’s charms unravel,
Seek it in all styles to find,
But one type you’d have to travel
Very many miles to find;
Nota lady on the scene
Fairer or more pretty was,
Thau the belle in cream and green
Prom the Sister city was.
Now, our little say we’ve had.
Poor, we know, the ditty is;
Truth to tell, almost as bad
As Kendall's own “Black Kitty” is!
Any doubt as to whether the Masons’ ball could bo
a success in midsummer was set at rest on Thurs-
day, for there was a very line gathering. A
spacious cloakroom was provided for ladies to
upoloud, and the gentlemen popped their para-
phernalia through pigeon-holes and received a
ticket in the style so familiar to those who visit
their “ uncle ” when times are hard. Light re-
freshments were available jou the first floor, till
the full supper was announced at midnight at the
top of the building. This hour was rather late,
and, consequently, the room at once became over-
crowded ; but, in spite of the attack which the
crowd made, tout d coup, on the tables, there were
plenty of dainties for all, and a variety and quality
of wines quite unusual at public balls. The
dancers found plenty of room on the floor, which
soon wore into good condition; and. though one
might suppose the two rows of pillars which run
lengthwise down the ball would prove incon-
venient, it was not so: they rendered it easier to
avoid collisions. On every pillar was a large
placard programme, with the air of every dance
against ft, engraved specially by Leigh and Co.,
who also did the pocket programmes. These were
limp and slippery, of special Masonic design, and
rather pretty. A large portion of floor was car-
peted and set with couches and chairs, as a reserve
to which the notable people were conducted on
their entry. First came the Mayor and Mayoress,
escorted to their places by Mr, P.D.G.M. James
Hunt. Next, the Grand Master of Victoria, the
Hon. G. S. Coppin, was announced, who was ac-
companied by a son and two daughters. Ho was
met by Mr. Farnell, and greeted with Masonic
musical honours. Then the Grand Master of New
South Wales Lodge, the Hon. J. S. Farnoll, made
his official entry, being similarly honoured as he
walked through an avenue of rods crossed over-
head. With him came a family party—Mr. Farnell,
jun., Miss Farnell, Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Martin, &c.
The opening quadrille was about half through
when, at half-past nine, His Excellency Lord
Loftus was announced, and the assembly fell ba< k
on either side —Red Sea fashion —while he
oassed through. He was, of course, received by
the two Grand Masters, and followed by Mr. Un-
win and Lieutenant Nathan. The quadrille was
then re-started, and the chief set was led by the
Governor and Mrs. Hardie vis-d-vis to the Mayor
and Mrs. Hunt, while Mr. Hunt and Miss G. Coppin
faced the Hon. Q. Coppin and Miss Farnell. The
governor was then shown about the building, and
spoke a few words of congratulation over the fes-
tive fizz upstairs. Ho was presented to various
high officials, and after an hour’s stay retired to
national music. As the evening advanced, it was
fairly cool. On one side of the hall a series of
double doors, which open (outwards, in case of
accident) right into the night air, afford good ven-
tilation; and the gallery, which is roomy and low,
Is a delightful place. It was constantly occupied,
as were the rooms also for smoking, card playing,
and allaying the pangs of thirst. On the floor,
Mrs. James Hunt looked her very best in a dress
of pale blue ottoman broche, liberally trimmed
with glistening beading of chenille fringe to match
and light trailing of small blue flowers; long blue
gloves completed a most graceful toilet. Miss
Coppin wore cardinal satin bodice and pink-pleated
skirt; and Miss G. Coppin pink veiling and satin,
with flowing hair. The two fair daughters of the
Grand Master, who came in with the Grand Chap-
lain, Mr. K. V, Gale, wore cognate colours—Miss
Farnell, a full warm blue, and Mrs. Martin a pretty
fresh v reen, both set off tastefully with white lace.
Mrs. Gale, attired in rich chaudron broche and
skirt of deep chesnut brown satin, enjoyed the
scene from the gallery. A little brunette, in a
terra cotta figured ottoman, was full of life and
colour; a dark-haired Randwlcker was also fond
of colour—a very brilliant cardinal satin. Tall and
fair was Miss Stewart in a neat pink satin and
white lace; and a little queen dancer from Peter-
sham wore pink also, with narrow ruby ribbons
and flowers, and a Grecian coiffure. Mrs. F. J.
Ril«y’s was another warm-hued costume, a hand-
some brocade of two blues, with pale blue satin
skirt trimmed with white lace and pink roses. Miss
Fyfe combined pink llama and broche with a train
and ruff, white lace epaulettes, stringed pearls
in the hair. A remarkable diess was of rich
blue satin, amply trained and edged with a lace
ruche, the front skirt being of a shade paler blue,
and the whole dress studded with roses. Rich and
pretty was the dress of a lady from a fashionable
open-sea suburb—corded silk of delicate fawn,
trimmed with costly white lace—and it attracted
many a look of admiration towards its generously
proportioned wearer. Mrs. Moulton displayed a
distlngud costume of palest heliotrope broche,
decolletee and sleeveless, the front skirt a mass of
fine white flounced lace, and the whole dress beau-
tified with a costly trimming of ostrich feathers;
armlets and bracelets of massive gold. A white
dotted net, a good deal distended with a waterfall
back, satin bodice, was nice, and the only one of
its kind. A tall sylphic young lady, decked a
simple white with real ivy leaves and tile-coloured
ribbons. Mrs. Sadler’s toilet was of tasteful white
figured silk, the skirt of small rows of white lace,
and looked prettily piquant. Mrs. Roberts wore
a fine pale blue and white lace; Miss Wallace, who
is a visitor from the Southern capital, a cream
broche and emerald. Mrs. A. Burne was very fair
and graceful in cream broche; and her sister, Miss
Daugar, wore white set off with bows and flowers
of plum tints, and a large bouquet fixed behind
the left shoulder. A little dark beauty wore the
very chic-est puffed cream satin, with half-sleeves
and very bouffant draperies, and even some of the
worshipful grand masters could hardly master their
worshipful feelings asthe stylish little maid circled
about the floor, in another cream satin which was
handsome, the burgundy velvet lining of the ruff
continued down the front and filled the square
opening on the bust, narrow rows of burgundy
velvet were round the hem, and were also used as
bows; gloves harmonised, and the hair was taken
on top in fashionable style. One of the choicest
dresses was of thin white satin, the bodice sleeve-
less, and the square front filled with softest cob-
webby lace, skirt of fine lace, hair dressed in twists
on the crown; and a scarlet hollyhock added to an
Interesting ensemble. One lady in cream striped
satin and gigantic flowers wore behind her left
shoulder what looked like a monster horseshoe
formed of white chrysanthemums The rendez-
vous were n«med after country lodges; and the
whole affair was one that the Masons and their
friends will always look back upon with pleasure.

Few spent a pleasanter holiday, albeit a
quiet one, than those on the magnificent Orient.
The temperate weather, tidiness of the great
steamship itself, lively races, lovely sex, luxurious
lunch, the patrician smile of Lord Augustus, and
several other things, combined to make the flag-
ship popular. A large quota of public men came
and wont during the day, including His Excellency
the Governor, the Mayor, and several Ministers.
Sir Alfred, and an array of nautical men of all
grades, from the captain of the ship to the juven-
ile commanders of cockleboats and dingles. At
the banquet, in the saloon, the Mayor was chair-
man, the Postmaster-General vice-chairman, and
a number of toasts were honoured. On the
various decks and promenades, chairs were scat-
tered plentifully round, and friendly parties were
formed along the bulwarks; some visited the
saloon or the social music hall, and others walked
to and fro to see and be seen. Almost every con-
ceivable variety of toilet was displayed, from
plain black or pure white, to all the various tints
of compound colours or the merging shades of
the diedal plaids. The black cashmere costume of
a tall fair lady was, in taste and make, perfectly
neat. More conspicuous was a dress of which the
close-fitting bodice and skirt were [of a woolleny
cream material, and the sleeves, hip band, and hem
of skirt of black velvet. Gayer still was the pink
nun’s veiling, with long box pleats, and liberally
bunched, of a pretty, fair girl. A yet fairer
wearer wore cream veiling, with bunches of plum
and crushed strawberry ribbon, looking very
nice, indeed. A fine dark stone cashmere was
certainly stylish, in redingoto shape, with large
ruched neckband, satin underskirt, and gloves to
match. A slim grace was well suited by a grey
homespun tunic, the lappels turned back with
purple satin, this also composing the underdress.
Several tartans were seen, a large patterned
zephyr of purply-pink being nicely made, and
enhanced by a poke hat lined with lightest apricot
lace. A tall girl's china silk dress of the usual
cane-colour was so neat that nothing else can be
said about it; and a brown holland dress ranks
about the same, only it was edged with a scarlet
roman scroll, and the belt was made of that also.
Two young sisters neat and nice in shepherd’s-
check gingham. Two other sisters wore flounced-
skirt. loose-bodied dresses of lightest muslin, with
a delicate wave-pattern running through it, and
wore really charming. And the remainder of the
nattiest toilets were chiefly white, which is extra-
ordinarily popular. They are all very similar,
some will have gathers and tucks, some not; some
be flounced and bunched, some plain; some em-
broidered. One neat blonde tried a golden belt
and gloves with success; others had coloured bows
on. The girls are all for lawn now, and as nice as
need be.

Some day, possibly, there will be a decent
mrmenadc in Sydney. At present the only walk-
ng block consists of three tacks—up George-
street, across King-street, and along Pitt-street to
Market-street. A business man who could travel
this route any fine afternoon at 5 o’clock, without
being bustled off the kerb and parachuted in the
left eye, at least twenty-five times, would be in-
ordinately smart. This state of things is due to
three causes. Feminine ignorance of the rule of
the road. Feminine disregard of it directly any-
one tells her what it is. Feminine feeling that
men have no business on the sidewalk anyway.

A new deviation from social routine, in
Oakland (Am.), lately, was a Wish-bone party for
young people. It comprised all sorts of novel and
ingenious games, interspersed with dancing.
There was the very old custom of breaking a hole
in a suspended bag of candy, and a scramble; then
the whole party had their fortunes told by the aid
of real cabbage heads. Young ladies were initi-
ated into the mysteries of Freemasonry—they en-
joyed that. Each young one received half a wish-
bone tied with ribbon, and the colours of the
ribbons decided who should be partners. Snap-
dragon followed supper. Then all single folks
passed through a darkened room, precisely at
midnight, while a solemn bell kept tolling, and
were shown with much dread ceremony the face
and form of their future partners on a large
mirror, each apparition fading away in filmy haze
to slow mupio. The idea was taken from Dumas’s
play of “ Henri III.” Those are the kind of parties
that dwell in children’s memories.
* * ♦
The Marquis of Normanby, Governor of
Victoria (accompanied by Lieut. Le Patourel),_ ar-
rived in Sydney, at 9 o'clock on Friday morning.
On Saturday, he visited Randivick Races with
Lord Loftus, whoso guest he was during his stay.
The trip over was quite a private one, in connec-
tion with his early departure from the colonies;
and His Excellency returned to Victoria by special
train from Redfern, at 4.30 on Monday afternoon.

On Friday, the 135th anniversary of Burns’
birthday was celebrated in the Protestant Hall, by
a social re-union, Mr. H. C. L. Anderson, president
of the Burns Club, being chairman. After an
address, recitations, highland songs and dances
were given, and cake and coffee supported the
audience through a long and varied programme,
.... Dr, Sheldon, |of Armidale, presented last week
with over 100 guineas’ worth of solid silverware,
and Mrs. Sheldon with jewellery, by their friends.
The doctor and his wife are homeward bound
Count Strickland, a Maltese, arrived from Queens-
landion Thursday. He called on the Colonial Se-
cretary, and wants to send [outlfrom Malta some
gardeners to show us how to grow oranges and
olives....Captain M'Clemens, of Balmain, gave a
capital Cinderella party on the 33rd inst. Ladies
mostly local and lovely—Mrs. De Groen, of
George-street, entertained some 50 guests to their
heart's content last week. A dark young lady
from Castlereagh-street was charming in black
velvet and lace, and white llama skirt. From
Phfllip-strcet tripped an enticing blonde in pale
blue. And a Melbourne visitor was graceful in
black velvet and satin. With geniality all round,
the evening passed pleasantly till separation time...
The members of the family of Mr. Allan Williams,
of “ Qlenore,” Canterbury, celebrated Anniversary
Day pleasantly by a picnic excursion to Tom
Ugly’s Point. Among the merry party was the
“ South Sea Poet ” from the United States, now
visiting his native place again — A bachelors’
party was held in the Masonic Hall, Parramatta,
on the 33rd January, and skipped to Skipper’s
band music till one in the morning — A fashion-
able ball was given in Needs’s Rooms on Wednes-
day, tho 33rd, by Mr. Mostyn Connor. Fifty
couples glided round the glassy floor, cooled in the
conservatory, or haunted the supper-room where
Compagnoni's efforts “gave pleasure to all.” In
spite of tho season, dancing was enjoyably kept
up till 3 a.m., and the fair ladies favoured the
colour emblematic of purity more than any other.
A string band furnished dulclferous music....
Captain Barry’s lecture in Parramatta was post-
poned for want of an audience....A beauty con-
test has been suggested in Melbourne. Nomina-
tions of ladies to be accompanied by entrance fees
and good photos , which latter are to be exhibited,
and then every man voting to furnish his full name
and address. Mon may be fools, but we don’t be-
lieve there are three men in Australia foels enough
to walk across the street to vote on a photo —
By the Carthage, which steamed off on Friday, Sir
James (C.J. of New Zealand) and Lady Prender-
gast, who have been a few days here, left for Lon-
don. Mr. Frank Punch also goes home in the boat.
On the 17tb January, a very large ball was
given in Melbourne by the Hon. J. G. Dougharty,
to mark the marriage of his son with Miss
Lindsay... In South Melbourne, Mr. T. B. Guest
celebrated his eldest son's majority by a costly
entertainment. From which we infer there is a
good margin in biscuits....At her residence,
Elizabeth-street, Mrs. Kron gave a birthday party
Thursday, her son having come of age. Guests
were made very welcome. A Moore Park lady in
ruby and cardinal proved attractive, as did her
sister in white. A Hebrew lady, whose name was
that of the much-loved son, was a delightful
songstress, and charming in white and flowers.
Dancing was kept up till well on in the morning,
and we are glad to kron-lcle the enjoyment that
took place....Tho handsome daughter of a good
Sydney family walked into a fashionable jeweller’s
shop in Hunter-street, the other day. She was
beautifully dressed, and, as the deferential young
man came forward, she asked if her bracelet was
done. It was not. “ Then,” said the lady, “ If it’s
not done when I come to-morrow, Fll wool per!”.,.
On the 33rd January, at Melbourne, the famous
fluteplayt r, Mr. John Radeliffe, was married to the
well-known opera singer, Madame Pauline Rita.

GENERAL AMERICAN IMPORTER, 72 York-street, Sydney
Sydney, Wednesday.
Dear Belle,—I know you will be awfully
disappointed when I tell you that I didn’t go to
the Masonic Ball last Thursday, and all because I
couldn’t have a new dress. How could I wear the
same dress throe time-s ? I told Pa I would not,
but he didn’t care a bit. and said 1 was fearfully
extravagant. I was as cross as you are when
Frank takes The Bulletin with him to read in
office hours, before yoii have had a peep at the
social page. Of course, I have heard a good deal
about the ball, and will tell you all I recollect.
That most hideous of all colours, crushed straw-
berry, is at last on the wane, for 1 hear there was
only one at the ball. There was a splendid helio-
trophe satin with bodice and train of a deeper
shade of plush, set off with white lace. A peacock
satin and brochie with the palest of pink roses a t
the throat and in the hair, looked extremely well
Amongst the simple dresses was a white muslin,
the top skirt being caught up here and there wlt.i
white satin rosettes, white shoes and silver flower
in the hair. A beautiful white was of China si .
and broche, made with short bodice and long train -
which, latter by the way, seemed to mar the enjo -
mentof the wearer, who was constantly pickln*
it up from the floor and throwing it tenderly ove*
her arm. A cream satin, with plastron of pa <
blue which glimmered through handsome crean 1
maltese lace, was extremely tasteful. The ha
was dressed high and fastened with a large get'

she fairly excelled herself the other night. H<-<
first costume was a waiding dress of pale lavender
silk, with parasol, hat, and beautiful plumes m
match; next, a ball dress made with a very loi a
train. The bodice and train were composed of tby
palest pink broqhe, and the skirt of crushed strav -
berry satin studded with large pompons, from
which hung white crystal tassels. The train w s
edged with a shell ruching of the two colouis,
eight inches in width. But the dress which best
became her was her old favourite combination-
deep primrose and black. This, too, was made
with a long train a« d edged with a ruching. Being
Saturday night, and Anniversary Day besides, the
house was packed; but our enjoyment was spoilt
halt the time by the horrid behai iour of some
unmannerly roughs in the pit, who were so noisy
that three times Signor Majeroni had to stop the
play and appeal to them. I couldn t understand
why they were not turned out, for it is a monstrous
thing that half-a-dozen mm should be allowed to
interfere with the comfort of hundreds. I am
sure,.dear, if I were a man, I wouldn’t stand it. I
was so sorry for Signor Majeronl, who looked so
dignified when ho refused to proceed until the
noise ceased. A splendid photograph of Signora
Majeroni was presented to each lady in the dress-
circle as a souvenir.
Parasols, if not of black satin, are usually seen
to match the dress. If, however, the dress is of a
very bright colour, a gieat Improvement is to
cover the parasol with lace, which gives it a rich
joft appearance. It is also the thing to have a
strap made of the same material as the parasol
and fastened on to one side, and so contrived as to
hold a bouquet of flowers. Fresh flowers are pre-
ferred, but of course artificial ones will do. Gloves
for both walking and evening dresses are worn
longer than ever, consequently sleeves are made
just to the elbow.
It is such a pity the popular concerts did not
answer. I am sure Mr. fluenerbein worked hard
to make them a success, but I hear he was con-
siderably out of pocket by them, Kelly, I don’t
think the Sydney people are truly musical, after
all; they only go to concerts which are under
fashionable patronage, or which are by invitation,
ime Madamo Kellermann’s, or Herr Kretchmann’s
I cannot help thinking, however, that had the
popibar concerts been held on any other than
attended mghts they wouifl have been better
Last Friday, when all the Public School children

I was the Kailway btation, however, when the
tram, which was to bring the might-have-been-
burnt ones home, was expected in, and it was as
amusing as touching to fee the crowds of anxious
mothers there awaiting their arrival. Notwith-
standing that they had had every assurance of
their safety, seeing ’s believing, you know.

horrible. I will tell you, when I see you, where
you can have your face dressed for evening wear;
but, as it’s a secret, I will not put it in black and

case the result was equally beneficial. It has been
used by members of my family, and its action has
satisfied my most sanguine expectations. I con-
sider it a most valuable preparation to have by
you for any household accident. I recommend it
confidently to ray friends, and am thoroughly
satisfied “ It Conquers Pain.”

A few days ago, a certain miner got somewhat
primed sufficiently so to induce a protector of the
peace to “ run him in.” The miner walked
quietly to the police barracks, when realising the
seriousness of his situation, he became slightly
obstrepon us, and the combined wisdom, in coun-
cil, of three bobbles, was that they should tie the
miner down. “Now, look h»ie, bhoys, let's have
fair play ? ” says the miner. “ Av coorse,” replies
Bobby No. 1, attempting to catch hold of him,
when a “stinger” on the nose sent him measur-
ing on the floor. No. 3 then showed to the front,
but was soon relegated to a position alongside No.

you wouldn’t strike me.” “Certainly not, but
keep your distance.” No. 3 didn’t keep h's pro-
mise, nor did the miner, the result being that the
latter coolly went his way. The matter has been
kept an open secret, as it would scarcely redound
to the credit of three policemen letting one man
get Scott free.

The ex-mcmbcrs of the Victorian artillery

that Dawvid had got his seat by a technicality

The immigration questiou iu Melbourne
cents to be nndirgolng a gradual change. Some
time ago the introduction of immigrants by the
State was met by indignation n Voulranee. Tho
venue is now changed. Tho working man is not
afraid of rivals: but, as Mr. Douglas informed
Lord Uosebcrv. if the State gave assistance, an
undesirable class of persons would be introduced.
It thus appeals that the working man is occupy-
ing not an economic, but a high moral ground,
and is standing in the fort front of Victoria, light-
ing to keep it from being polluted by ti e low pro-
fligates of the old world. This is a heroic attitude
for Hodge to s'rike.

grumble when ho is asked to pay handsomely for
the luxury. He was called up by Service, the
other day. and censured. The Board had found
that Mr. Ferres was guilty of nepotism, as had
been the allegation of Player, but that he was not
guilty of other things with which Player had
charged him. Broo, severe censure. It snot just
like the Anderson case, but a New South Wales

It struck us when reading a description of
an appliance invented by a Mr. Cowling down at
Cdotlemaine, that it will bo a great pity if Iw use
be not more extensive than the inventor projects.
It is describing as an apparatus to prevent over-
winding. It has been employed at the Ajax Com-
pany s mine, and its merit is that before the cage
rises to a dangerous height above the surface,
steam is shut off automatically. Now. could not
t he apparatus bo applied, somehow, to the bydnej
Legislature ! We can t suggest how. for wo were
never mechanical, but we leel that U the inventor
beard m‘Eihone, be d bo able to fit it on somehow.
According to accounts. It shuts olf steam auto-
matically? That’s the very idea. All that is
wanted is a genius to apply It.

written in round hand, and read much this way :

“In the delightfully healthy advice to Lord

The Duke of Bedford is a great London
landlord. He is of the bluest blood. No footman
or lady’s maid has been mixed up in his family af-
fairs tor ever so long. His ancestor of 10(1 years
ago was highly thought of by Edmund Burke,
who said of him:—“The Duke of Bedford is the
the leviathan of all the creatures of the Crown.
The-grants to the House of Bedford have been so
enormous as not only to outrage economy, but to
stagger credibility. The political merit of the llrst
Eeusloner of the House of Bedford was that of
eing concerned, as a councillor of State in advis-
ing, and in his person executing, the conditions of
a dishonourable peace with France—by instigating
a tyrant to injustice, to provoke a people to rebel-
lion; by giving his baud to the work and partak-
ing the spoil with a prince who plundered a part
of the national Church of his time and country; by
being a prompt and greedy instrument of a level-
ling tyrant, who oppressed all descriptions of his
people His grants were from the aggregated and
consolidated funds of judgments iniquitously
legal, and from possessions voluntarily surren*
dered by their lawful proprietors with the gibbet
at the door. His merits were by acts in which he
served his master and made hi* fortune, to bring
poverty, wretchedness, and depopulation on his
country.”
Mr. J. L. Purves, barrister-at-law (Melb.),
told the Sandridge young men belonging to the
Australian Natives’ Association that a confede-
rated Australia, presided over by a Prince of the
House of Hanover (.sic), “as had been the case in
the Canadian Dominion” (also sic), was what he
wanted to see before he died. Th« young men
cheered It is only charitable, of course, to say
they didn't know wnat they were cheering for.
We shall enlighten them a bit. No Prince of Han-
over or Brunswick ever presided over Canada. A
young man (the Marquis of Lome), who married
one of the Queen’s daughters, was shovelled into
the post of Govcrnor-ueneral by Disraeli—from
whom Tom Carlyle wouldn’t take a decoration,
considering him the biggest political humbug of
the age—and he had to leave for home again,
partly driven out by the laughter of sixty mil-
lions of people. For the Canadians could not
always afford to have their great southern Neiga-
bour laughing at them. An old and experienced
statesman is not what Mr. Purves wants. Ho does
not require a man of mature age who has been
bred in the best political schools. No. He must
have a young Prince out of thv nursery to
direct Australia. And me Sandridge young
men—whose mothers or sweethearts (he Prince’s
female relatives wouldn’t touch with ther fans—
cheered him. If Mr. Purves were a man of any
political or even social weight, his Sandridge
speech would be a serious “sleeper" on the lino
of federation —so far, at least, as N.S. Wales is
concerned. We can assure him that, however
well adapted “princes" are for an advanced
society such as that of Victoria, we humble people
of N.S. Wales don’t want them. Wo believe tuat
society would be better, happier, and more pro-
sperous: that there would be ess of the terrible
struggle that results in luxury and starvation
being found side by aide, and more of that
thoughtfulness for others that makes life agree-
able, it all the princes in the world were in “ Han-
over” occupied in making an honest living mixing
mortar, sawing wood, or any other lawiul occu-
pation. We have seen some of them round our
way, know what they are, ip fact, and—we don’t
muon Ufee them.
While some Australian statesmen tire ad-
vocating the consolidation of the Empire *>y the
creation of Colonial and sonm hy
reckless alienation of the public estate, and by
other means equally short-sighted, are preparing
the way for a condition of society resembling that
against which the struggling classes of Europe are
constantly crying out, it is as well to glance occa-
sionally at the views put forward by > ngluh
Radicalism to accouut for the wide-spreading
misery which is at pre ent causing such a lermont
in that and other countries. Here is one which,
whatever its value, can scarcely be contemned for
lack of plain speaaing;— ** The statesmen of Eng-
land are beginning to wake up to the awful fact
that the poor of their large cities deserve some
consideration. London is stirred when consider-
ing the wretchedness of St. Giles' and the spread-
ing squalor of which that cancer is the centre.
Parliament has legislated for the benefit of the
minority. The nation has been run in the special
interest of toe wealthy and aristocratic classes
both at home and abroad, hut there is coming a
revulsion which will cause a greater shock than a
thousand dynamite explosions such as occurred
the other dav in the Underground Railway tunnel
of London. The politics of the poor will set aside
the politics of the rich and bring about reforms,
or else toe increasing rottenness of morals, as
found in the St. Giles ot every city, will pave the
way lor the destruction of the country, it is not
the ra"id increase ot children which the disciples
of Maithus claim to bo the superabundant cause of
human misery, but the concentration of wealth In
tae hands ol a lew persons, and the injury to health
and degradation ot morals from overcrowded and
ill-ventilated tenement, houses. One day, the poli-
ties of the poor will come to the front, and neither
gua nor cannon nor ironclad can put down the my-
riads of people who will force remedial legislation.”
And here another, equally outspoken;—" We have
made emperors, and aings, and princes what they
are, and are keeping them what they are. And,
while engaged in drawing a comparison between
England and America, we must not forget the tar
more important one between Europe and America.
America is larger than Europe—-it will soon be
more populous. It is governed now at a far less
cost to its people than any one of the great
Powers ot Europe. It is paying off its national
debt. There are idle and therefore poverty-
stricken people everywhere. But no one who will
work need die ot starvation in America, In Eng-
land, men, and women, and children not only die
of starvation, but l.ve in a state of chronie starva-
tion, while many an English peer—and squire, too
—would turn up his nose at the salary of the
President of the United States. Europe is borne
down and crushed by the enormous and ruinous
expense of its imperial and royal iamilles, of its
hereditary drone class, of its vast standing armies,
and its enoimous national debts. The millions toil
and sweat and go without the ne p essaries and
decencies of life that a small idle and non-produc-
ing and squandering class may idle and revel and
waste. Hence come the Nihilism of Russia, the
Socialism and Communism and Anarchism and
Feniunism of other nations.” Beside questions
like these-involving the right of millions to live
with decency—how strangely read the demands of
Sir Henry Parkcs for titular baubles to please the
childish vanity of successful colonists or obtain for
th°m social recognition in Mayfair drawing-
rooms!
The growing unpopularity of the House
of Lord-* renders it rather important that wo
should really know what sort of people it is com-
posed of. Because it is only seif-flattering preju-
dice and large vested interests that keep the insti-
tution in existence: it has been long" known that
no reason that would satisfy the mind of a true
statesman can be advanced in favour of its main-
tenance. Whether the House ot Lords is to con-
tinue as a drag on the nation, will in all likelihood
be one of the chief issues when the present Eng-
lish Parliament is dissolved, even if the agitation
is not precipitated before then. One thing is clear,
that if the nation thinks the House of Lords has
ceased to be (if it ever was) a necessity, the Lords
have no one to blam* for starting the belief but
themselves. Whatever intellectual importance it
! has, attaches not to it as a whole, but to the
] rare power of some half-dozen of its members.
It is undeniable that the whole of the real
business is done by less than a dozen men,
out ot over live hundred. Except on the |
rarest occasions, nine-tenths of the members
never show their faces inside the House. Their
interest in the country is so great that they cheer-
fully delegate everything to anybody, so long as
they themselves are not interrupted in their plea-
suring and profligacy. As statesmen, they are
worse than nobodies, for when they do roll up and
vote, it is to perpetuate some time-sanctioned ini-
quity in which are bound up their )anded or titular
interests. Apart, now, from the few Uords who
1 use their brains, and who oan he counted on the
ting-era, we propose to briefly give an idea ot some
ot the hereditary legislators of Great Britain.
There are in the House twenty-six Dukes. Two
take an active part in the deliberations—the Dukes
of Richmond and Argyll. It is true the Duke ot
Northumberland was in Disraeli’s last cabinet, but
he has since then fallen back into as dim obscurity
as the second richest Duke in ■ he kingdom could
attain. He is a melancholy, dismal old man, quite
oppressed with the sen-e of his own greatness—
a greatness wuich would be enhanced, however, if
he toul i forget that bis family name was not long
ago Smithson, and was graciously changed to Percy
by tbe sovereign, to suit his aristocratic title. The
Du e of Marluorough is another whose line is
not straight; and no doubt the fact that he is
infamous as a roisterer, liar, libertine, and wife-
beater is clear proof of his fitness to make laws t or
common plebeian people. The Duke of Bedford is
enormously ilch, and is as as a pawn-
broker. The Du.eof vv estminster is the richest
Duke in the United Kingdom, and one of the
closest. He is, however, amative to a degree-so
perhaps, somebody gits something cut of him.
Although tne Lords strenuously opposed tho
Deceased Wife’s Sister Bill, the Duke did not
he icate to marry—though he is old and she very
young—his own cousin, before even his flrst wife
hod been decently mourned. She had been pne of
the most striking and voluptuous beauties ot
English society. Viscount Mandeville is a con-
firmed drunkard, and is, like the Duke of Marl-
borough when Lord Blaudford, tabooed in London
society. The Duse of Leeds is a nonentity; the
Earl of Boston has distinguishid himself by mar-
rying- a courtezan named Kate Cross ; and the
Duke of Beaufort is a horsey dandy, who has been
a masher for thirty years past, and t,ho “ protector ’
ot Connie Gilchrist since she turned 14. The Duke
of Portland is h goody goody young man, who were
he hot stupendously wealthy, would he thoroughly
detested by any girl of spirit, uf 19 Marquises,
Salisbury is tbe only one who is respected for a
fair amount of ability. Tho House of Lords is
prolific In Earls, of whom there are 118. Granville,
Kimberley, Cairns, Carnarvon, Selborne, ana
Dufferin ’ are the only ones really prominent
beyond their own counties or estates. Lord Hard-
wicke Is an impoverished spendthrilt; Lord Ayles-
f )rd is a disgraced man, who benefits England by
living In Texas ; Lord Shrewsbury is the premier
Earl in England, who married Mrs. Mundy, nearly
old enough to be his mother, after living in adul-
trey with her for years. When not conducting-
orgies at his seat, Ingestre, he Jives mostly on his
yacht with the ‘•Countess,” to escape the sneers of
those who know him best. 'J he Earl of Dudley Is
as supremely ugly as he is rich, and noted tor Ins
sensualism. Perhaps we are prejudiced, but we
don’t think it absolutely necessary these men
should have the privilege of making laws. And
perhaps they will not have it for long. Tho cry of
outcast London is rising louder and more strong,
and the miserable millions who have been torpid
in their squalor and ignorance are beginning to
know not only their strength, but the kind of men
who have been governing them in the Ignoble
House of Lords.

Auckland Harbour Board have just “re-
lieved ” their engineer of his trust, because his
estimate of the Calliope Dock was £40,000 less than
the tenders. How many engineers and architects
would be “relieved ” over here under similar cir-
cumstances?— The rumour per cable that Lord
Augustus Loftus was to succeed the Marquis of
Normunby as Governor of Victoria, points to the
fact that the Imperial Government still holds to
its policy of dignified Wmkleism.

To tbe suggestion that the landlords them-
selves might do something to relievethe sufferings
of their poor London tenants, an English paper
replies:—as well might Adam have tried to dress
up the serpent in the Garden of Eden with a white
ti , and start him off a Methodist local preacher. ’
We don’t quite see the point of this. We’ve met
some very odd animals dressed up as local preach-
ers, and doing a roaring trade, too. . “ London’s
bigger landlords are aristocrats of tho flrst water,
and aristocrats would swallow up the sunshine
and make us pay for the very daylight wo use on
their land if they could do it. This refers to the
“ rookery ” owners in East London, and could not
be applied to anyone in Australia According to
Sir Thomas Brassey, the French ships have the ad-
vantage over ours in speed and in ordnance, and,
numerically speaking, the French Navy is as strong
as ours.
HER GIET.
It was the witching hour of night,
While broadly beam’d the moon,
When ghosts come out “humans ” to fright,
That he b?gau his tune.
He blows aloud one gruesome note:
A night-capp’d head outpbps—
And now he has no Sunday coat,
Alas! she “gave him slops!”
And soon within her window shone—
tt joy !—a flicker ing flame!
That sent a thrill through his trombone,
And through his breast the same.

, , Sandusky, 0., May 31, 1880,
I have used your Acid Phosphate and can pro-
nounce it a very valuable addition. I find it use-
ful and beneficial in nervous dyspepsia, nervous
depression following overwork and anxiety, as well
as the gastric derangements. Where there is
venous stagnation and sluggish circulation, a dull,
heavy head, It Is of undoubted value. Fast grow-
ing children require this valuable addition.

In regard to the Hereford's Acid Phosphate, 1
have used It very extensively, and with the most
remarkable success.
I give it in dyspepsia and in all cases where there
is uerangement of the liver and kidneys. With
my patients it has agreed wonderfully.

A. 8. Carpenter, M,D., Keene, N.H., says :
‘ Horsford’s Acid Phosphate is a valuable medi-
cine. I have taken it myself, and for several
years prescribed it for my patients, when suffering
from indigestion or innervation of the digestive
organs, ana always with satisfactory results. It is
a good nerve tonic, and in some cases of morbid
urine, ‘ it acts like a charm,’ producing the desired
result. It is pleasant to the taste, acceptable to the
stomach, and is, in my opinion, an excellent and
valuable compound.”
Can be borne by the most Sensitive
Stomachs.
' Fair Haven, N.Y., March, 1880.
Horsford’s Acid Phosphate, in elegance of com-
position, stands unrivalled. It is pleasant to the
taste, and can be borne by the most sensitive*
stomach. Have prescribed it with marked benefit,
in indigestion and urinary troubles. It forms an,
excellent substitute for i,emon juice, and as such,
will furnish a refreshing 'drink for the sick.

HARROW .moxham & co„
Agent*
Before the moat noble Rosebery left \ ic-
toria, Mortimer Pranklyn addressed a letter to
him, and published it in the columns of the Would,
We have been much impressed by this epistle,
which, in point of style, is a cut above Junius, and
in respect of argument a great advance upon
Froude. It is also a courteous letter, and it con-
tains a variety ot information concerning Rose-
bery and his wife, which will strike those distin-
guished people as fresh and novel. Mortimer says
thusly: “It is natural that a promiscuous Stream
of Immigration such as arrives fortnightly on
those shores should be ns varied in its mental
calibre as it is dissimilar in its physiognomic
types.” Hold on, now, and take breath. Heady?
Well, keep your emotions in hand, Mortimer pro-
ceeds t “Unequal as must be the mental force
which such an oUn podrida exercises, it is no
chimera to assume that each unit upon returning
to his or her llresidc, recount # i Us little circle
the true status of Australian soci y r .” Yum, yum I
What d'ye think of that for high t Hut you've only
tasted the soup. Now for the entremets. Referring
to the particular benefit derived by these colonies
from the visit* of the Rosebery order, Morty goes
on: “Of this class, my lord, I accord you only your
just due, when I say you are a conspicuous unit ”
There. Hold on a minute, and take that sentence
to pieces. Done? All aboard, and on we go.
Mortimer proceeds to say that Rosy is the very
button of fortune’s cap. “Fortune,” erlrs Morti-
mer, "gave you a most excellent start, when
she secured for you the amiable lady, who
is now the Countess of Rosebery.” Morty
doesn’t know that she bastes her Primrose with
the broomstick occasionally'—although he does
write as though the Countess had been “rounded
up” like a Queensland gin, in the cause of Rose-
bery’s passion. However, let us trot on. Thus
our Frar.klyn : “In addition to her enormous
wealth, the daughter of Baron Meyer brought you
a name so cryatalised by a country’s stainless
honour aud philanthropy us to have become
historic in all languages I" Gebomineyl Whip
that. now. Chrystalised stainless honour in all
languages ! Chry'stallsed-stainless century —no,
we can not. It is too much. We can submit to
Carlylese—Emerson delights us much—Ruskin is
like strawberries and cream to us; but Mortimer’s
richness of diction andalfluencein imagery knocks
us—it does, indeed. And he goes on: " The Coun-
tess will not think me unchivalrous, I trust, when
1 atlirra that fortune has reserved the greatest dis-
tinction of your life to be in connection with
Australian politics." Observe the raison d'itre
here indicated, and be good enough to remember
that there are milestones on the Dover road. Pass
the jug, while we wind up. Morty alludes to
Forbes as a “ weak aud vulgar scribbler.” Then
ho says that there are “3,000,000 of intelligent sub-
jects in Australasia, who love their Queen as de-
votedly as any British subjects can, yearning to be
loved in return.” Touching this—" Yearning to
be loved in return.” Humph!
“ ’Twas all very well to dissemble your love.
But why did you kick me down stairs ?"
Yes, Mortimer has distinguished himself by
this letter. It is not a common letter,
anyhow. It is picturesque, mind you; full of
lights and shades, and that sort of thing, like a
picture by an old master that has been smoked up
the chimney until you can't make out whether it
represents a Virgin and Child or a cow. Oh, it is a
rare letter. It speaks of the “quality of the ma-
terial which constitutes your (Rosebery’s) brain;”
it says that "Australians love England, and only
ask England's lovo in return;” and it winds up
with the following astounding sentence: “Inad-
dition to this, judge the honour which awaits you
at home, and in the pages of future history, if,
charged with what you have seen in Australia,
you can succeed in convincing the Imperial Go-
vernment that the Federation of the Australian
colonies is the first stage of the crystalisation of
the dream of the greatest men in Britain-the
Federation of the British Empire.” There. Is the
jug empty? Exhaustion hath us in her grasp.
Let us take a big drink, and sing the forty-se ond
psalm, as follows: —
HA MEItK.
Wo only ask from you, our mother,
The love that is a daughter's due;
We pray thy mgis o’er us cover,
And don’t put on ollicial screw.
Mark Morty’s weighty words, dear mother,
As writ to Primrose, in his print,
And ask the Grand Old Man, dear mother.
O'er Franklyn’s burning words to squint.
Cut not the apron strings, dear mother,
Still feed us on the pap of yore;
With kisses still your infant smother,
Maternal blessings on us pour.
Let Mortimer, most noble mother,
The truth reveal concerning us;
Nor Jet old Gladstone snub us, mother,
Or Derby blight us with bis “cuss.”
To federate we’re anxious, mother,
In bonds of sisterhood to join;
Become a nation, dearest mother,
We’ve got the check—we’ve got the coin.
Protect us from the French, dear mother.
Annex the islands right away;
And so preserve us, dearest mother,
Prom recidiviste and (UporU.
The French no claim have, dearest mother—
In Court their action will not lie;
No claim! because, oh, dearest mother,
Eh ? Well—ahem I—I can’t say why.
But this I know, oh, dearest mother.
And it behoves that you shonld know—
The Islands all are ours, mother,
For Franklyn, of the Wouli), says so.
Victorian statesmen also, mother,
Whose tame you’ve heard in pcean sung,
Declare the Islands ours, mother,
And so that question’s settled—bung I
Then heed our prayer, oh, noble mother,
Relax thy stern and fearful brow;
A corner-man’s sweet smile discover,
Our hill in Equity allow.
So shall you earn, oh, dearest mother,
The gratitude of this fair land;
But, if you don't— now mind me, mother.
Look out for squalls—you understand ?
A number of people in a room agree that
one should go into a neighbouring apartment.
Then the remainder agree among themselves that
the absent one on his return shall do certain
things such as kneeling or sitting in certain p aces,
singing songs previously decided on by those loft
behind, finding articles hidden in out-of-the-
way corners ot the room, &c. The absent one re-
turns and is blindfolded Two of the others meet
their fingers around his neck, and all concentrate
their thoughts on things to be done or to be found.
The blindfolded person then—having had no com-
munication with those who remained in the room
during his absence—proceeds to attempt precisely
what they, during his retirement, had willed he
should do. When he has gone through his task,
and his bandage is removed, ho is generally found
in a state of great nervous prostration. This
“mesmerism,” “thought reading”—what you will
—is the amusement that is arousing spe. ulation in
half the drawing-rooms of England. The accounts
of successful experiments are half-convincing in
their matter-of-fact minuteness. Any small assem-
blage of young or old can try it, and let us know
the results. We are dreadful sceptics in these
matters—but “there are more things in heaven
and earth,” &c.
hire Chinese Gordon, tho D.T. says that
“He undertook his celebrated work in Egypt
under a firman from the Khedive, in which he was
appointed Governor-General of tho Equator.” It
will be remembered that some surprise was caused
by Gordon’s return to England before his mission
was half completed, as his Chinese experience
showed him to be a man that never did things b
halves. We had too much regard for Gordon to
say what we knew about the matter, but now that
the D.T. has blurted out ihat it was as “Governor-
General of the Equator,” he went to Africa, our
hand is forced and silence is no longer possible.
The fact is the troops—if the rascally Bedouins
can be so designated—with which he was com-
missioned to hold on to the " line,” were of the
very worst materials, and should never have been
sent on such an important service. One night
when they had coihd up the “slack” for safe
keeping in the guard-house, the whole guard got
drunk, and before morning a band of vagrant
niggers dx-opped in, and made away with the
Equator towards Timbuctoo. Gordon pursued
them, picked up one end of the missing line and
yoked all his forces on to it for a “ tug of war.”
But the cunning niggers had put a hitch of the
other end round the Greenwich meridian and
were half-dead with laughter to see the way poor
Gox-don’s men were wearing themselves out in a
fruitless struggle against the blind forces of
nature. Then the “ Governor-General ” sent some
carrier pigeons to Cairo for camels, but before
they arrived the “line” had disappeared, and he
found himself a disgraced man. This is the true
stoi’y of Gordon’s experiences as “ Governor-
General of the Equator. ”
There is one drawback to the reports
which distinguished visitors to these colonies carry
to the old country, in the circumstance that their
information must be necessarily limited, and will
not always stand the test of accxxracy. Lord Rose-
bery no doubt has “saturated” himself with much
statistical knowledge of these colonies, and believes
himself competent, by reason of personal expert-
enceand observation, to pronounce upon the ways
that are peculiar of the inhabitants thereof. But,
still, his knowledge is not full enough. For instance,
tho other day, in the course of his speech at
Adelaide, he referred to the literary status of
Australia, as indicated by the works of two
great geniuses, Marcus Clarke and Adam
Lindsay Gordon. This was well enough. But
had he known all that is to be learned
about this particular subject, he would not
have committed the mistake of omitting the
name of Henniker Heaton. Poor Clarke, and no
less poor Gordon, did much to establish a literary
reputation for these colonies. R ut, after all, what
were their achievements to tnose of Heaton ?
They fade into insignificance beside the literary
efforts - of the Toavn axe Country man. “His
Natural Life” is good; and Lindsay’s poems are
admirable. But has Rosebery ever had Heaton’s
“ Australian Dictionary ot Dates and Men of the
Time ?” Hal There’s a work for you 1 There’s
a colossal production! There’s a volume of brain
effort! And in the face of the supreme fact ot
the existence of this superior accomplishment,
my lord ignores the first genius of these parts—
Henniker Heaton. It is thus that modest merit is
wronged. Too bad, too bad.
There is a vacuum in Victorian society.
Rosebery has gone ; so has Mrs. Rosebery—we
mean the Countess. Fact is, we’re so unused to
countesses, that it doesn’t come glib to us when
we have to refer to them. Well, the Earl and the
Countess have gone, and Victorian swelldom
mourneth. While they were there they were a
a great draw. An Earl among Victorian wool-
washers and soft goods elite is about as good a
thing as a bull pup or a patent jimmy to a burglar.
They kinder feast on him.—
“ There have been gods, and may be gods again,
But never sure such god as this, I ween."
Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the
wealthy lower orders ot Victorians worship a lord.
They hang on to bis skirts. They tread in bis foot-
steps. They await him at corners, and dart out on
him “ unawares.” If he go to a theatre, you bet it
is a good night for tho treasury. If he attend
church, never so plentiful were the worshippers.
If he #0 to bathe, there is a struggle for his towels
And so my Lord Kosebery and bis wife have had a
warm time of it. 1 hey couldn’t got anywhere with-
out an attendance. Noticeable was the limpet-likc
affection with which a fashionable woman of the
** Jewish persuasion ” clung to the Countess.
Blood is thicker than water; and albeit old—say,
Moses’—daughter, like old Sbylock’s Jessica, has
“taken up” with a Christian, the smouches of
Victorian society seem to be proud of her. “ Vot

"Oh, thar! Tho’el p mo. Vot a creature! Vot a
lovely creature! Vorth a million of money, Joel!

Well, she isn’t bad-looking-for a Countess—and,
as Mr. Abrahams says, she is worth a million of
money. A million of money 1 Ah! that's it. No
cosmetic like money, A million of money would
give Sir Henry Parkes the nose Grecian, or the

Buchanan—anything- otherwise impossible of ac-
complishment. Wouldn’t it ?

first as a remedv for Pulmonary complaints, and
the latter for Dyspepsia and disorders of the Liver

Rev. Father Wilds’
EXPERIENCE.
The Rev. Z. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary in New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court, writes
as follows:
“ 78 E. 54 th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
Messrs. J. C. Ateb & Co.. Gentlemen :
Last winter 1 was troubled with a most
uncomfortable Itching humor affecting
more especially my limbs, which Itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that 1 could scarcely bear any clothing
over them. I was also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and ray system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first close. After
a short time the fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
were also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly Improved, until
it is now excellent. I feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all confidence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. I took
it in small doses three times a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles. I place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may do good.
Yours respectfully, Z. P. Wilds.”
The above instance is but one of the many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from Impure or impoverished blood, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of the stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Scrofur
lous Diseases, Eruptions of the Skin, Jthau-
matism, Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of the system.

HOW WE WERE ABDUCTED.
Mr. Philip Croft, we observe, has recently
been committed for trial for abducting one Mar-
garet Cavanagh, under the age of 16—the precise
number of whoso years, however, our esteemed
consemporary the Rum gives as “ H5.” It seems
that Margaret was a Hebe inaPitt-street hash-em-
porium, and that the giddy boot-closer (tor such
1s the Croftian profession) spoke soft things to her
over the fumes of his Scotch broth, and declared
devotion over his duff. Suspicion on part of the
proprietor, we are informed, as to the affectionate
feeling existing between the two, was first aroused
by the spectacle of a “ help ” of steak and kidney
pie which Margaret was bearing towards her lover,
the pic having been, so to speak, ransacked of
kidneys in order that his meal might be made the
more toothsome, thus reducing the restaurateur
to the necessity of “ striking out the words ‘ kid-
ney’” in the item on the bill of fare which re-
ferred to the pie in question. On another occa-
sion, too, when the Lothario had asked for “ .jam
tart," Maggie was detected in the kitchen adding
another layer of raspberry to h<?r lover’s slab of
pastry from out the restaurant jam-pot. Yet,
strange to say, no one in the establishment com-
pletely dropped as to the actual state of the case.
We don’t know how Mr. Croft will get on, and we
don’t care much; but we are chiefly interested in
this case from the fact that, though we have never
abducted anybody, several attempts have been
made to abduct us. One instance, however, will
suilice to prove our attractiveness. In our pros-
perous times, when agent for a Ghost entertain-
ment with a cement-repaired mirror, we were stay-
ing at a nice hotel in a North-eastern city, calmly
and contentedly waiting for the show to arrive.
It didn’t come so soon as was expected, on account
of the Ghost having had a difference with a trades-
man or two in another town; and these irate mer-
chants, it seems, had temporarily “stuckto" the
reflector. This proceeding on their part prevented
the Ghost from walking, in a double sense, and
left us for a month or two enjoying board at £3
a week, and bartering front seat orders for refresh-
ment. The landlord, who had been long pensive,
would at times speak to us deprecatingly of the
resources of his own establishment and loudly in
praise of the rival bostelries, stating that for a
perton of our distinguished appearance the Royal
Hotei, at the other end of the town, would be far
more suitable. We smiled on him—we even manu-
factured little jokes for him; but our interest in
the dinner-bell never diminished.
• i «
One day there arrived at our hotel (the
Duek and Musket' a stout, dark lady, with a very
great deal of luggage, a very great deal of hair,
several teeth, and a parasol strapped to an um-
brella It transpired immediately that she was a
rich widow, who was engaged to be married to the
landlord—a bachelor. We met her constantly, and
in a day or two wo perceived that she admired ua
very much. After breakfast one morning, when
she had been there a week, we met her alone in
the sitting-room Everyone in the hotel had gone
out to a school picnic, or a cock-tight, or some-
thing, and there was no fear of our being inter-
rupted. Being aware of her relations with the
landlord, and not wishing to make things worse
than they were, we were about to retire, when she
raid “1 would like a word with you.” Behold the
door shut, and us both seated on the colonial
sofa. She gazed on us with her large
black eyes, and said, “Would you take” (we
glanced involuntarily at the bell) “would you
take mo to bo susceptible ?” Too astonished to
answer. “ Well,” she continued, edging up and
placing a plump hand on ours, “lam. True, I am
engaged to Mr. Demijohn, but I do not love him.
I love you; and, mark me, I cannot conceal it.
Now,” she went on, .“there would be bloodshed
if he knew this. You must not stay here.” We
remember in our utter stupor murmuring some-
thing about being pretty comfortable, our only
complaint being the abnormal strength of the
butter. “ 1 am rich, and I love you,” she went on.
Two kisses. “Let us fly together : but first,” she
blushing!/ zddsd, “ we must be quietly married.”
Such a pair of eyes. These were undoubtedly
genuine ; though grave doubts arose in our mind
concerning the voluminous bangs. No Ghost—no
money — uneven heels —and an angry washer-
woman to face ; we consented.
• • •
“ In two hours, then,” said she, embracing
us fondly ; “rooms shall be engaged at the Royal.
Leave all to mo. Meanwhile, get together such few
necessaries as you will require until your trunk can
be remoyed. j ;i will await you here.” We went up-
stairs, and were about to put together a collar, a
tooth-brush, and a pair of socks, when we caught
sight on the dressing-table of a bottle of brandy.
“Thoughtful creature!” we exclaimed; and with
the aid of our gum-glass immediately proceeded
to drink it. We remember then being awakened,
leaving the hotel with the widow, and arriving
outside the Royal. Then we remember her bid-
ding us enter first, so as to throw olf suspicion.
Then we recollect going upstairs to our new quar-
ters, and finding there more refreshment. Another
sleep ensued, and when wo awoke a letter was be-
side us. It was from the other landlord, and
signed “D. Demijohn.” “ Kate didn’t work it bad,
did she ?’ ran the letter. “ It was less trouble and
looked better than turning you out. Give M‘Fo-
garty a turn now. Ta, ta.” Here endeth the
account of our lirst abduction.
Dr. Anna Potts is now haranguing the
“gumsuckers ” on “ What to eat, ami now to eat
it.” But she skips over the greatest trouble of all
down there—viz., “ Where to get it.”
The sale of expired runs took place to-day
in Mr. Arthur Martin's auction rooms,” says a
Brisbane telegram. No quotations are given of
prices, and we are left in the dark as to the market
rates in living runs.
Here’s a hiccup from our Rockhampton
namesake:—“ Where drunkenness is increasing,
crime is diminishing, and where the people are
most sober, they are most criminal.” “ Krish-
mish ” lasts a long while up North.
Caspar Neraka, a well - known Mary-
borough miser, having occasion to do a little jour-
ney, begged a lift in a farmer’s cart in order to
save the shilling for a ride in a covered ’bus. And
on the way he dropped dead from sunstroke. The
moral in this is obvious.
The Herrerton (N.Q.) Advertiser advises
its subscribers in consequence of there being ‘much
disunion in the community,” to “ bury all local
jealousies.” This issue came out after the last
little politico-religious article had tilled the lock-up
and the hospital. No allusion was made la the
article to burying the local rum.
The Shoalhaven News says it is now 18
years old. Typographically speaking, anyhow, it
looks 1800. The ancient W., addressing his sub-
scriber, says that his journal is “ unexcelled by
any r> f the tnuahroems on the South Coast. ’ “It
Is," he exclaims, with becoming modesty, “the
best and largest." The supporter is also assured
that “a Judicious review will be exercised on all
matters appertaining to civil polity or local gov-
ernment.” It is easy to sec the S. N. is 18 years
old, and that the same man who writes it now
wrote it when it was first started—18 years ago!
The News may be the largest and best mushroom
on the South Coast, but it strikes us it would not
be very difficult for another to ketchup to it.
Constant complaints are being made
touching the niggardly manner in which station-
ery and store articles are doled out to country
telegraph offices by the Sydney authorities, who
seem to labour under the impression that their
rural brethren make mock-turtle soup out of the
sealing-wax and gum-arabic supplied, and sup-
plement their slim salaries by disposing of their
message-forms to the man who runs the local fish-
shop.
We are told that an American company
publishes the Dental Cosmos, which has long
been the acknowledged “ leading exponent of the
thought of advanced dentistry. We believe the
Indian Corn Doctor had intended founding a simi-
lar e.vponent of the advanced thought of corn
cutting, under the title of Bunion’s Cosmos, but
as he is on a visit to Pentridge, and will be very
busy tor a year or two yet, the publication will be
delayed.
M. O’Rell, in his amusing book “John
Bull et Son Isle,” says, “In France, when a crime
is committed, we ask * Where is the woman ?’ In
England we say. • Where is the chapel ?’ ” He
doesn’t specify the crime, and therefore may bo
said to rather overdo it. So far as we arej con-
cerned, however, when wo hear of something in a
basket neatly done up; in a blanket being found
on a door-step, wo are not quite sojgenoral. Wo
merely say, “ vvho was the deacon ?”
Now that public attention has been
directed to the fact that Sir Moses Montefiore has
lived to be 100 years of age, about seventy very
learned men—very learned, but badly in want of
patches on their boots, and very badly indeed in
want of a glass of rum—have started in to trace
his descent in a direct line from Methuselah. They
expect Moses to make them some little recogni-
tion. We think it will be rum if they succeed.
But that’s just what they think, too.
A lady who has apparently borrowed a
spider’s handwriting, sends us something about
two Wollongong young men going to Dapto, or
Dubbo, or somewhere, and calling at a house
where resided some young ladies they knew - (no-
thing even thrilling in this so far). The gentlemen
were, it appears, asked to tea, and after tea begged
one of the young ladies to sing. She commenced,
it seems, as follows
“A Blank and Co. young man,
A half-holiday concert young man,
Who went across to look for his horse
With that vivacious Dapto gal ” (sic).
“After this,” says our fair correspondent, “they
thought it best to leave, and, after a * good night ’
all round, took their departure.” No wonder!
And then, we suppose, the young lady who thus
satirically sang climbed up the kitchen staircase
and proceeded to clear away the parlour tea-
tmngs, having previously washed her hands at the
Somebody signing “Ceb ’’ has been writing
a lot of uqiimalia* in the News, called “Mrs
Green on the Sydney Liedertafel,” with the solo
purpose, apparently, of championing Mr. Ashcroft
Edwards. Here is a sample of the stylo of Alfred’s
latest litterateur—or, perhaps (who knows 7i it
would be more In keeping 1 to say, his newly
acquired charwoman : —“ * I intend,’ said Mrs.
Green, ‘ being at the next ‘ smoke concert.’ ” ‘You
forget women are not allowed, Mrs. Green.’ ‘Non-
sense ; who always sits in the retiring room ; I
what’s her name? You won’t tell me? Well,
surely if one lady goes another can. I wonder if
she smokes? I shouldn’t like that.’” Now, we
are perfectly certain that when the boss read this,
his face puckered up into a little smile, and he
liked it. We can see him as we write this, under
our lamps, in the middle of the night, put on the
l ack of the copy in pencil, “ Set this artikul up in
print;” and then, after an hour’s deep cogitation,
add; 11 Mem.: Author to be asked if he understands
groining or scrubing.”
“ I'm m a most unfortunate position,” he
remarked, as he entered the sanctum and breathed
soft memories of a distillery in the direction of
the editor,” and I’ve just dashed otf a few things
here which will make your paper hum.” And he
produced a roll of MS. written on the backs of
tripe-shop bill-heads. “ Hum,” remarked the
editor after a rapid—but masterly—glance over a
few sentences, “ pretty quick, are you 7 Dash
off rapidly?” The contributor intimated that
lightning was a fool to him in the matter of
rapidity. “Then,” the editor said with a significant
wave, “give us a sample of what you can do—now.
Dash off rapidly. Mind the steps. See?” He saw;
and the harrassed man of scissors communed with
himself. “ Confound those bummers,” he mur-
mured; “they seem to think that they have only
to be ‘ in an unfortunate position ’ to be entitled
to fill up the paper with their rubbish. Want to
change places, I expect. If I only put in their
stuff I’d very soon been going round, myself, ex-
plaining that I was * in a very unfortunate posi-
tion.’ ”
Dean Maliouey is of opinion that when
Homan Catholics consent to marry Protestants
they are merely getting “dispensations to make
themselves miserable.” Yes, he is quite right; for
they forget that the wife is expected to obey the
priest before the husband—to pay the exactions
levied for church mummeries before she satisfies
the demands of hunger and of decency—to send
her children to the school, not where education of
the intellect is the foremost consideration, but
rather the elevation of Komanism above every-
thing else on earth—to tell ignorant boorish
ecclesiastic matters which delicacy keeps even
from her husband’s ear—to entertain no hope of
“absolution” (delivered direct from God with a
strong Irish brogue) on her dying bed—to have no
chance of “extreme unction,” or interment in
“consecrated” mould, and no possibility of
escape from eternal “purgatory” (except by
very heavy fees) unless she submit to all this
abominable intolerance. Yes, the Dean is quite
right. Young couples generally forget all this in
their fervour, and, when they come to discover it,
they find, as he very sensibly observes, that they
have begun “to make themselves miserable.”
Dean Mahoney and his kind might remedy some
of this misery, if they liked.
A pert young fop interrupted Lord Beres-
ford when ha was speaking- at Tenby, and said he
couldn t listen to a man who had a head like a
bmled bulldog. Whereupon Lord Charles looked
him in the eye as ho does when he knocks a
man out of time in no time, and when he had
drawn the attention of the whole audience to the
purple face of the impertinent fellow, observed
t “ at perhaps a head like a boiled bulldog was
about the thing when a man had to speak to a
head like a roasted puppy.

the corresponding hair-spring and the watch is

let him have the watch for two or three days, so
as to observe the motion. I answered, ‘ On the con-

an exact idea of your manufacture.’ At Paris, I set
my watch by a regulator on the Boulevard, and on
the sixth day I observed that it had varied 33
seconds And this watch is of the fifth American
grade; it cost 75 francs (movement without case).
At my arrival at Loclo, I showed the watch to one

take it down —in other words, to take it to
pieces. I, however, wished first to observe it; and

A young gosling went into a tobacconist’s,
and, laying down halfpence, said,
“ Gimmycigarette.”
The tobacconist took the mouey,
and gave lu exchange there-
for a cigarette, aud the gos-
ling went his ways.
Presently he felt exceeding ill, and he
laid him down, and lifted up his
voice, saying, “I perceive that
smoking does not agree with me,
I shall leave off where I began.”
And he kept his word. Surely a boy
would have been more persever-
ing.
