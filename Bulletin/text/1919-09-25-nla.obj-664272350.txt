BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few —the more
stoical among us —can avoid worrying over past or prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the result
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Freckles and How to Cure Them.—lt is always
those with the finest and fairiest skins who
freckle most easily, but this knowledge is poor
comfort when the face is disfigured with these
ugly little blemishes. To prevent the forma-
tion of freckles a wash should be applied to
the face which will form a shield from the
rays of the sun. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by dissolving an
ounce of eleminite in four tablespoonfuls of
hot water. Shake the bottle, and when cold
apply to the face and allow to dry on the
skin. If this is done every day. renewing the
application whenever the face is washed, and
a little mercolised wax rubbed into the skin
every night, freckles will not make their
appearance, no matter how hot the sun. To
remove freckles which have already formed,
applv the wax every night, rub it well into
the skin of the face and neck and leave it on
till the morning. Then wash off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water.
To Reduce a Double Chin.—To reduce a double
chin, give hard, firm massage every night with
mercolised wax, stroking the flesh firmly back-
wards from the chin towards the lower por-
tion of the nock. Do this every night, and in
the morning bathe with cold water and rub
into tbe skin a little parsidium jelly. This
treatment will strengthen the flabby tissues
and restore tbe contour of the face. Occasion-
ally a double elfin is due to stooping over
books or work, but generally it Is the result
of putting on weight. When the latter is the
case a few elynol berries, eaten regularly every
day, will greatly assist in reducing the super-
fluous flesh. A glass of hot water should la-
sipped after each meal.
The Hair—To Increase the Growth.—Tonrres'
an undue falling of the hair and increase tl.
growth, scalp-massage and the application o
a good tonic is absolutely necessary. Part tln-
hale in the centre, and, starting at the fort-
head, massage for nt least ten minutes. Then
apply a tonic. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by mixing one ounce
of bo ran ih m (which can lie bought at the
chemist’s) with a quartet of a pint of bay
rum. Add the boranium to the bay rum, allow
to stand for half an hour, then strain and add
sufficient water to make half a pint. Dab
amongst the roots of the hair with a soft
sponge.
Superfluous Hair. —Dark-complexioned women
are far more frequently troubled with u
growth of superfluous hair than those with
fair skins, and at tin- first sign of these objec-
tionable hairs steps should lie taken to remove
them, or they will develop into a strong growth
which will take a very long time to destroy.
A little powdered pheminol applied to this
growth will remove the unsightly blemish,
destroying it permanently if the hairs be but
few. Two or more applications may be neces-
sary, if the growth be unusually strong, but
about one ounce of pheminol should lie suffici-
ent for the most stubborn case. Pheminol can
be obtained at tlie chemist’s, and a little
powdered alum should be obtained at the
same time for dusting the skin before applying
the pheminol.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO DARKEN THE EYEBROWS (L.M.). —
There is no dye which I could recommend as
“safe,” but if you rub a little mennaline into
the eyebrows and at the roots of the eyelashes
regularly every night it will darken them
naturally, and will also increase the growth
of the eyelashes.
TO REDUCE WEIGHT (SADIE).—Yes, your
weight and measurements are certainly more
than they should be for your height, and I
quite agree that being so stout makes you look
old. I ani pleased to be able to tell you of a
quick, easy and pleasant way to reduce both.
Get a small quantity of clynol berries from
the chemist’s and take onb after each meal,
three times a day. Weigh yourself after one
month’s treatment, and you will be delighted
with the result.
TO KEEP THE HAIR PAIR (DORIS).—If
you shampoo your hair regularly with stallax
granules it will prevent it from turning dark.
One teaspoon of stallax is sufficient for a
shampoo, and an original packet will make
from 25 to 30 ■ shampoos. Stallax keeps
indefinitely. [4
TO IMPROVE A DULL, MUDDY COM-
PLEXION (D.B ),—Your complexion Is dull
and muddy-looking because It needs thorough
cleansing and renewing of the outer cuticle.
To do this get a tin of mercolised wax, and
with the tips of the lingers rub a little gently
into the skin, going over the entire face and
neck. Leave the wax on all night and in the
morning wash it oft' with a good soap (you
will find Pilenta excellent). In a month’s time
you will notice a most surprising improve-
ment. (2) Liquid pergol will prevent the
excessive perspiration of wh'ch you complain.
(3) Nothing can be done,
TO ARREST GREYNESS (FLO).—You are
indeed far too young to go grey yet. Get
about two ounces of concentrate of tamrna-
lite and mix if with three ounces of bay rum.
Dab this on the hair and amongst the roots.
It will soon make matters all right.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K.).—To
whiten neck use jettaline. Get a tube of
this from the chemist’s and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks and you will find that the
skin will become beautifully clear and white.
When there are Miles Between Inkstands.
When the nearest inkstand is very far away—-you will
be glad to have an Onoto Pen —it makes writing so
easy. At home, at the office, everywhere, any time—it
is the pen that’s always handy—always ready for use—
always of service.
You know about the Onoto. That it is
—the fountain pen that fills itself in a flash
—the fountain pen that never leaks, soils and spoils
—the fountain pen that always writes smoothly and
without scratching or spluttering.
Now is the time to get an Onoto Pen. It costs 17 i; and can
be obtained at all stationers, jewellers and stores.
Go to-day to the nearest stationer’s and say—“ An Onoto Pen,
please ”

[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Death came and took away my friend,
And shut the door ’twist him and me.
What is this Death that makes an end
Of all that once was brave and free?
They write fine things of hungry Death
Who never felt his icy breath.
Death, they will tell us, is a king;
A majesty, a high release;
They lift their feeble pipe and sing
As children say their little piece;
They praise—who never knew the grief
Of one who weeps without relief.
The wind that lifts the moving dust,
The universal dust, hath it
Not breath, unasked, upon it thrust,
To find the end for it is writ,
Even as it is writ for man,
The dust upon the Potter's van !
The Potter’s van grinds on through space,
With all the turning worlds for wheels;
The moving dust lifts up its face,
And for a moment, living, feels;
Then enters Death—and one is left
Weeping within the dark, bereft.
Death came and took away my friend ;
I ask, bewildered, why? and why?
The candle flares toward an end,
And dies as even man must die.
Are we but candles lit to show -
The way the Potter’s trail must go?
Death came and took away my friend;
The day is dark, the way is dim;
I had a coin I cannot spend.
For it was strange to all but him;
But he, alone, of all the earth,
Could make its value and its worth.
I had a coin—nay, ’twas a thought;
All minds were gardens where he wrought!
He brought the spark 1 where only rock
Answered another’s fumbling knock.
And then came Death and made an end,
And left low weeping for a friend.

J. F. Archibald
The Bulletin is now about 40 years old.
It was founded by J. F. Archibald and John
llaynes. Haynes died two or three years
ago; Archibald, on September 11, at the
age of 64, leaving the'world, especially the
journalistic world, the poorer for his loss.
The two founders had a few—rvery few —
stormy years of joint-editorship, for Sydney
was then no very good place for fresh ideas.
It was old—much older than it is now. It
was profoundly stodgy and mid-Victorian.
It was “loyal” with the old Throne-and-
Person type of loyalty; intensely disloyal
in the national sense, seeing that it hadn’t
begun to know that Australia existed; and
possessed of a profound belief that Mel-
bourne was the home of devils, and that if
Brisbane and Adelaide also set up as rivals of
the old city, they would be homes of devils,
too. Therefore, tbe new paper had an exciting
career. The principal excitement brought
William Henry Traill in as editor and chief
proprietor. Haynes dropped out and started
a venture of his own, and the difference be-
tween it and The Bulletin was the mea-
sure of how much of the early Bulletin
was Archibald and how much was Haynes.
After a brief period as sub-editor, Archi-
bald was in full control about the end of
1885, and his reign lasted 16 years, though
during the last six years of that time, from
1896 to 1902, he was a weary man who
gave little interest to larger matters. Seven-
teen years elapsed between the date of his
complete literary retirement and his death.
Yet he left such a profound impression in
his meteoric period that to the end he was,
in the mind of everybody, “Archibald of The
Archibald and Haynes in 1880 —the year of
the founding of THE BULLETIN.
Bulletin.” His name always appeared on
the paper during his time, the visible reason
why he thus identified himself with it being
that he was never identified with anything
else.- The Bulletin was his existence and
his one interest in life. Traill and Haynes
dabbled in politics as a side-line. Archibald
would as soon have thought of applying for
a bishopric and mixing gaiters with jour-
nalism as of standing for Parliament. George
Reid’s offer of a nomination to the Upper
House was .rejected so promptly that the
messenger who brought the offer was still
in the act of sitting down when he got his
answer, and resumed the perpendicular be-
fore he had fairly quitted it. Archibald’s
only comment afterwards was that he had
always managed to pay his own tram-fare.
Tfie versatile mab of theory is the one
who can do everything and do it well. He
doesn’t exist. The versatile man of reality
is sometimes the Kaiser type who does
everything and does it badly.. Archibald
was the really versatile man, inasmuch as
he knew what things he could do to per-
fection, and had an amazing knack of find-
ing the men he wanted to do the other things.
He didn’t write verses or tales or leading
articles. He never published a book —good.
bad or indifferent. He had no real acquaint-
ance with finance. His political opinions
were clear and definite, but he never read
up the evidences of them or against them in
books —in fact, books of reference of all
sorts were his bane. He took a gi-eat delight
in the artistic, personal and social side of
the paper, and in these directions he was
unrivalled. And he revelled in bush remin-
iscences and old Australian traditions. For
the rest he answered the description of a
certain French king who achieved great re-
sults with little visible effort, while pro-
fessedly bigger men toiled incessantly to no
purpose—he was “well-served.” He de-
served to be. Capable men gi’avitated to
him, and none of them quitted him volun-
tarily after they had found him. At least,
only one man did so, and he was already
bound to the Bar when he took a spell of
journalism in passing. Archibald was in-
tensely appreciative of good men, and gave
them credit everywhere for their work. If
some club acquaintance casually mentioned
an article or a paragraph as having roused
his interest he ransacked his memory to
bring out the name of the writer. He was
the antithesis of another newspaper mag-
J. F. Archibald in 1887.
nate—not a writer himself —who described
evei-ything as “my article,” and when once
challenged said, “Well, it’s mine. I paid
for it.” Therefore Archibald was sur-
rounded by an atmosphere of intense loyalty,
and it still existed even after a long period
of ill-health had somewhat dirnmed his spirit.
Incidentally, Archibald was‘kind to failures
provided they weren’t rich and pi-etentious
failures. A good many budding newspaper
hacks, who looked like becoming sxib-editors
to small country job-printeries in . their old
age, he steered with much trouble into other
and more hopeful walks of life.
He was a lonely man in his later years
—a childless widower with no near relatives
close at hand. He had no hobbies after he
abandoned his youthful habit of catching
fish, or, rather, he forgot about the habit in
his journalistic interests. Being asked lat-
terly if he had any special amusements, he
said he devoted some time collecting and
studying bores, Avhom he unearthed at clubs
and other haunts, and that he meant to
bequeath his collection to the country.
When Archibald died he left innumerable
friends and no enemies save the kind that
every man ought to • have.
J. E.
The Warrior’s Brain
There is not such a wide difference between
healthy and abnormal brain conditions as
most people imagine. There were plenty of
curious cases amongst the Diggers which
showed that there existed a condition of
sub-consciousness during profound sleep, and
in one case during a stupor that had existed
for weeks. The victims were affected violently
by certain combinations of words, and when
these words were spoken in an ordinary tone
the men responded by an appropriate action.
To other combinations they were totally
oblivious.
Here are two authentic cases in point.
The first was a perfectly healthy gunner
who could go to sleep on the limber of an
18-pounder when the horses were tearing
over the cobblestones in France. He also
went fast asleep at meal-times. His com-
rades might shout “Hi! Bill, there’s a shoot
on,” roll him over and shake him vigorously,
hut Bill remained dead to the world. The
open sesame in Bill’s case was “Battery
Action,” spoken in an ordinary tone, or even
whispered. Bill sat up at once, buttoned
his tunic, and rushed from his dugout ready
for instant action. The other was a show
case, and had been in hospital in a state
of stupor for weeks. The doctor, after shout-
ing himself hoarse, dropped some convenient
article under the bed, remarking quietly,
“Where are those bombs?” Out of bed rolled
the patient, groped for the missile, and,
having found it, promptly hurled it through
the window as if it were red hot. After he
had proved to be a dead shot, a screen was
put up to protect the glass.
No wonder our men, especially those who
had to do with 18-pounders, are restless,
irritable, neurasthenic and what-not. Many
months will pass before the brain and ner-
vous system in such cases will consent to
move smoothly along in the old, familiar
channels. The war has caused the Digger’s
nerve energy to overflow its banks, and he
must wait patiently until it comes back
again to the main stream.

A Poetry Shop in London
There is a little shop tucked away in an
old, half-forgotten London street. Many a
returned Australian soldier must hav«
gone past it as he went up Kingsway
towards Russell-square and Bloomsbury-
square.* Walk up Kingsway, broad and busy
and modern, past Southampton Row, where
all the old booklovers go, until you come to
Theobald’s-road (you say it “Thibbald's-
road,” why no one can tell), and then you

I have the quiet eyes of chaste Penelope
And all her healthful ways,
As with a simple song I move dispassion-

Through the persistent days,
Soft as a summer breeze that winnows the

With breath not hot nor cold.
And yet I know that I am Cleopatra, too!
With mouth for love as keen ;
With leaping pulse and blood as warm and
rich in hue
As fired that Eastern queen.
I could be wanton, too, in conquest, fierce as
she
Who gladdened Antony.
So I that am two women go disguised as one
All my life long!
And witless men who mark some strange

Some discord in my song,

COTTON HANDKERCHIEFS AT 5s.
A new boom of great dimensions is reported
from Lancashire (Eng.), where a combine
is acquiring cotton-mills galore and making a
trust or close corporation. It is presumably
in league with similar arrangements in other
countries, else its confidence in the chances
of profiteering would hardly be so magnifi-
cent. Britain and the United States between
them command practically the, whole of the
world’s cotton supply; for Australia, though
the same size as the U.S., and with a larger
cotton belt, plods along fin the old ruts of
wheat and meat and a little gold and a great
deal of borrowing, and spends £6,000.000 or
£8,000,000 a year on imported cotton goods.
In recent years the demand for the raw
material has pressed more and more closely
on the supply. Now the war has thrown a
number of the younger rivals iu the business
out of commission ; and a universal demand
for shorter working hours is expected to
further limit the output of the manufac-
tured articles. The time thus seems ideal
to corner the trade and put up the price of
Australia’s imported pocket-handkerchief to
55., so that it will require about an acre of
wheat, which takes a year to grow, to buy
half a dozen of them in bad seasons, just as
now it requires an acre of wheat in fairly
good seasons to buy enough better-class im-
ported serge to make a child’s frock. The
confidence of the English end of the combine
to put up, and keep up, prices in this coun-
try is so enormous that the £4O shares in
some of the enterprises it has acquired are
valued now at £195. It takes a great deal
of confidence in future profiteering to pro-
duce such a result as that.
* * * *
In such matters as these Australia
is always regarded as a negligible com-
petitor. It acquired the wheat and sheep
and cattle and mining habits before it got
into the hands of borrowers and Bolsheviks,
and it appears to be taken for granted that
it won’t acquire any other habits. It has
so many people employed building £5 10s.
per cent, railways that aren't expected to
pay fivepence-halfpenny per cent, that it
really hasn’t labor to spare to make its own
cotton handkerchief, no matter how much
it may be profiteered; and it never will have
unless it replaces its loan politicians with
manufacturing politicians, and with agricul-
tural ones who are something more versatile
than cheap-wheat monomaniacs and land-
jobbers. So foreigners put up the price of
cloth made out of our own wool from 300
to 500 per cent, in calm certainty that we
won t be maddened into making our own
cloth on a larger scale and cutting into the
export trade. Oil people also fix their prices
without worrrying about the possible com-
petition of our “great natural resources.”
They don’t fear to rouse the sleeping lion
for they regard it as dead. And when the
new combine charges ss. for the small cotton
handkerchief it wouldn’t be worried even if
Austz alia s cotton belt was twice as large
and its supply of labor in search of employ-
ment three times as large as they are. It
assumes that Australia’s first resource' will
be, as ever, to demand higher wages on Gov-
ernment loan jobs, and more Government
niake up for the increased cost
ot living. Until Australia gets out of that
irame of mind it will remain what it is—
one of the most kickable and most profiteered
countries on earth.
* * * *
V ictoria, to take one example at random,
has labor on its hands, in the shape of re-
turned soldiers, mostly available to fight the
foreign profiteer with. It has just published
a statement of what it has done with some
this labor up to date. At a cost of
±11,049,385, men (number not stated) have
been furnished with 202,474 acres of land—
about £lO 2s. 6d. per acre, or about £lOl2 for
a humble 100-acre farm. Allowing a very
skimpy sum for house, tools, livestock, seed
and sustenance, these figures mean £1250
each. There were 58 “estates” purchased—
one of SBB3 acres; one of 2107 acres ; one
of 1204 acres; and one of 1056. The rest
were smaller—in fact, 18 were of less than
100 acres and 30 of less than 200 acres.
No new_ settlement was made, and no big
monopolies broken up. It was merely a case
of bribing old cultivators who knew the
game to go off so that new ones, many of
whom didn’t know it, might go on. Not one
man of this crowd was utilised to attack
the foreign-profiteering evil. They were
simply set to grow the old stereotyped, cold-
weather crops of which the country already
has enough or nearly enough or too much.
They and others like them might have been
set up in the cloth-making trade for £225
each, that being the value of the entire fac-
tory outfit per “hand,” with a much greater
chance of success, no staggering mortgage
and probably better wages. If the wages
weren’t naturally better, then they could
have been made better per medium of a
tariff, and with nearly £BOO saved per man
the country could have afforded good wages.
It wouldn’t have been necessary to shove
out old clotlimakers to make room for new
ones, as is being done with old farmers,
for there is room for new men. There would
have been about as many people on the land
this way as the other way, for the previous
farmers would have remained. And one
variety of foreign profiteer would have been
struck so hard that even with high wages
the price of some kinds of clothing might
easily have gone down 30 per cent, or more.
The establishment of the cotton industry
would possibly cost more, for it would involve
the growing of raw material as well as the
building of factories; but the cotton-grower
would at least have an assured market at
his door, which some agriculturists have not,
and so would the manufacturer if sufficiently
protected and not too much Bolsheviked. But
unless some labor —a great deal, in fact —
can be spared from the job of swanning
petty farms and (what is a much bigger
thing) from the building of the 54 per cent,
or 6 per cent, railway from Kookawallaby
to Mumblejumbuck, this country will have
to pay what the outsider darned well pleases
for the cotton handkerchief and the child’s
underskirt. A Trust which has such a
gigantic theft in sight that its £4O shares
are selling at £195 certainly intends that
we shall pay pretty highly. By the time the
next big loan falls due Australia may, indeed,
be wiping its perspiring countenance with
gum-leaves.
ERIN CELEBRATES PEACE.
The average Australian reads the cables
about Ireland with impatience and wonder-
ment. While recognising that there is
idiocy on both sides, his irritation is chiefly
directed against England, which has had so
many chances to end the calamitous old row,
and has so unfailingly let them slide. The
Boers got self-government while the memory
of their dead was still burning within them,
and despite the opposition of the identical
gang which has always opposed Home Rule
for Ireland. The wisdom of the policy soon
becaihe evident; and never more so than
during the late war. In India, if the
Montagu-Chelmsford scheme is adopted,
as it seems likely to be. a form of Home
Rule by means of communal representation
will come into existence which would have
been jumped at by Ireland 25 years ago.
The initial property qualification will en-
franchise five million Mohammedans. Sikhs,
Eurasians and other pagans, many of whom
are still hostile to the British raj; and the
move will no doubt promote harmony. The
Irishman’s hatred of England has always
been more histrionic than real. Shaw re-
marked with truth once that the best argu-
ment with Irish recruits invariably is:
“Gome forward as usual and help Old Eng-
land through a stiff fight.” The Irishman
is “white” in every sense of the word. He
mostly talks the same language as his
oppressors on the other side of the Chan-
nel : or he did until the fury of his nation-
alism spurred him to the study and halting
use of the jargon of his tribal forebears. He
plays the games and he races
like the Englishman; and the Englishman
tries to ride like him. And, above all. he
intermarries so freely with the enemy that
a London-Dublin wedding arouses no more
comment than a Manchester-Birmingham
one. Why should Downing-street trust the
Boer and the Bengalee while keeping in a
humiliating state of semi-subjection a race
which has fought voluntarily on land and sea
for Britain for generations, and which is all
that the world means by British in its tastes
and habits? That is what the Australian
asks himself when, recalling that Ireland
has never been more “disloyal” to the Crown
than (say) Oxford was in the second half of
the 18th century, or than Ulster was in the
first half of 19i4, when Carson and the
present Lord Chancellor of England were
raising an army of rebellion there, or than
Australia was during the Republican wave of
the mid-Victorian era, he reads that “police
and soldiers in full war kit have searched
for arms and ammunition over a wide area
in Ireland, including Dublin, Londonderry,
Donegal, Galway, Cork and Skibbereen”;
that “an extra regiment has been drafted to
County Galway, and the men have been dis-
tributed at many points,” and so forth.
* * # *
If the national problems of a proud people
could be solved on material lines—that is
to say, by bribes —England’s troubles as re-
gards Ireland would be over by this. The
English policy which led to the evictions of
the middle of last century has been abandoned
to such purpose that nowadays Ireland is
more owned by the Irish (as opposed to anti-
Irish landlords and the Church) than Aus-
tralia is owned by the Australians (as
opposed to big and mostly absentee land-
lords and English companies). The travel-
ler in counties such as Meath finds that
every farmer owns his holding, and that the
cottages everywhere ure 50 per cent, better
and more sanitary than those of Wilts or
Devon. In England 11 per cent, of agricul-
turists own the land they occupy; in Ire-
land 68 per cent. State-aided land purchase
by the tenants (sales being compulsory on
the part of the landlords) is still proceeding
—and the Saxon taxpayer is finding all or
nearly all of the money. The wages of Irish
agricultural laborers now range from 30s.
to 355. a week; one of the clauses of the
Lloyd George Government’s Corn Produc-
tion Act fixed the minimum rate for Eng-
lish toilers in the field at 25s. —which, of
course, became the maximum. Throughout
the war food necessaries of all sorts were
nlentiful in Ireland —almost as much so as
in Australia. Many thousands of Irishmen
fought in the Great War as volunteers ; but
Downing-street was too considerate to use
compulsion in the matter, and so there were
othev thousands who shirked —as there were
in Australia. The ending of the war finds
the martyred old land one of the most pros-
perous on earth —a place of booming fac-
tories, smiling fields, full piggeries and un-
rationed beer; tourists are flocking to it
from all over the less fortunate parts of the
world and English money continues to pour
int;o it. But so also do English troops. It
is an insane situation, and, to the Austra-
lian, inexplicable, because it has been pre-
ventable for so many years and because there
is no apparent need for it now.
* # * •
If the Party system could be wiped out in
Britain at once, and if, simultaneously, two
or three dozen fanatics —mostly racial or
religious maniacs, living in London —could
be gagged for, say, 12 months, a settlement
of the Irish trouble might be arrived at
which would suit. 90 per cent. of real Ir:sh-
men, Ulsterites included. In the past this
section has noted the irreducible minimum
acceptable to the Nationalist type of Hiber-
nian and then offered something less—
usually something very much less. The
policy of Palmerston in the days of Vic-
toria was in every important respect that
of Carson in the days of Edward and
George. As fast as the sympathy and gener-
osity of England expressed themselves in
proposed Land Acts or any other sort of
ameliorative legislation, Party opposition
either upset the measure altogether or made
it one that was accepted with bitter-
ness. Gladstone’s efforts in the Home
Rule cause were defeated in this
way. The same tactics were employed to
keep the existing Home Rule Act off the
Statute Book, and having failed they were
used to make it inoperative. Palmerston
gave Ireland Fenianism; Carson has pre-
sented it with Sinn Fein ; and, doubtless, if
given time, he will bring Bolshevism there
as well. It won’t worry him, since he is
one of those Irish patriots who do not
own a foot of land or a shilling of money
in the country. With such politicians and
their infuriating activities out of the way,
the settlement that reasonable Britishers out-
side Ireland look for comes well inside the
bounds of practicability. Such hostility as
there still is to Irish self-government would
drop dead with their departure. All but the
diminishing body of fiery Orangemen see the
need and logic of it —that, the money of the
English in the form of land-purchase advan-
ces can be no more acceptable in the long
run to Ireland as a nation than the same,
money in the form of ships was to the Com-
monwealth when the R.A.N. was inaugura-
ted. The Irish are not likely to forego their
hopes of nationhood for cash, however use-
ful the latter may be at the moment. But
it is a mistake to think that any great body
in Ireland are Republicans or separatists.
The propertied Hibernian is too keen a man
of affairs to swallow any such humbug,
though it is useful for purposes of threats,
and stimulating as subject-matter for
oratory. ' It will take more than the high-
falutin talk of De Valera and his followers
to persuade this now common type in every
walk of business to quixotically throw over-
board the advantages of the English connec-
tion. The typical and best sort of Irish-
man wants his country to remain inside the
British Empire—on terms; the same terms
which the other Overseas Dominions have
enjoyed for generations, and which even
India looks like getting now. But he is
revolted at the idea of being paid perma-
nently with bread and circuses to play a
serf’s part. People such as ourselves, who
already possess autonomy, can better under-
stand the Irish talking republicanism, in the
circumstances, than they can comprehend the
Unionist policy of trying any longer to keep
them in subjection at the point of the
bayonet.

should also be opened.”
As amended, carried unanimously, with suppressed
laughter, and unsuppressed winks. — Revised minutes
of proceedings at the N. S. Wales Nationalist Con-
ference.
Decentralisation of this sort has been
earnestly advocated at the last ten N.S.W.
State elections in order to catch votes north
and south. Both parties grew purple in
the face with excitement over it at the last
10 elections, but nothing happened in be-
tween times—not a thing. And nothing is
intended to happen now, else the leaders of
the party would open a sample port now, or
decentralise something now, instead of put-
ting the battered old vote-catching shibbo-
leth into the election programme for the
11th time. The nearest approach to doing
anything for decentralisation was the rash
act of the McGowen Government, then new
to office, in opening 11 miles of single line
to fill in the gap which denied to the wheat-
growing districts around Finley the use of
the 155-mile short-cut to Melbourne and
made them dependent on the 455-mile track
to Sydney, and also made them pay 600
needless sea-miles on their export business.
That was in 3914, the line being started in
1913 when McGowen and llolman knew no
better. As a result Moore’s Almanac de-
scribes Finley as "a rapidly rising town,
population 1600.” llay, in the same locality,
the same distance from Sydney that Finley
was before it got its short cut to a near port
(Hay got no short cut), was clearly de-
scribed in last census as a rapidly failing
town. The Government lias bragged of this
11 miles of single line ever since as a proof
of its earnestness in decentralisation, but it
swore off the habit there and then. The
experiment proved that, with 300 miles of
useless haulage cut out, the border might
be littered with prosperous little towns, pay-
ing taxes and land rents to Sydney, but
making the trade returns of Melbourne
bigger. Also they might reduce the conges-
tion of population, and, in fact, acquire so
much population of their own as ■ to set up
a separate State. Barring ports other than
Sydney, for oversea trade the point at which
commerce on the N. S. Wales southward
line wants to turn to Melbourne instead of
Sydney is dunce. On the Northern line the
point at which it wants to turn to Brisbane
instead of Sydney is Armidale, and by cut-
ting out an awkward elbow the turning-
point would be shifted to about Walcha.
Westward the point at which trade wants,
for reasons of economy, to make for Port-
land (Vic.) or Port I'irie or Port Victor
(S.A.) instead of Sydney is between the
Lachlan and the Darling.
* * * *
Over much more than half the awkwardly-
shaped Ma State trade is dragged to Sydney
at a.ruinous cost in needless mileage. Goods
are sometimes made to pay for 450 miles of
haulage when 350 would suffice. The result
is emptiness, poverty and actual depopula-
tion in many fertile districts, railway deficits,
general revenue deficits and every sort of
backwardness. The motto is: “Better a
desert than a place that doesn’t trade with
Sydney ; better a howling waste than a place
that doesn’t belong to Sydney.” George
lleid’s crazy amendment of the Constitution
denied any relief for districts that want to
secede by appeal to London, which was the
way Melbourne and Brisbane got loose and
were able to become big cities instead of
being replicas of Eden and Coff’s Harbor.
The only appeal—unless the impoverished
outlying districts go on some sort of political
strike—is to Sydney, the one place that
won’t listen, and the remedy for successful
appeal is to keep those parts of the State
which are only artificially attached to the
metropolis so devoid of people that their
objection will be easily voted down. The
howling desolations have to howl more, and
the congested city has to congest more so
that the size of the area controlled from
Sydney may not diminish and th’e city’s
pride bo abated. A purely city Government
which has gone to so many shifts to combat
the tendency of trade to flow to compara-
tively distant places like Brisbane and Mel-
bourne isn’t likely to go out of its way to
raise real competitors closer at hand. Its
attitude towards decentralisation is evi-
denced by the. fact that it only requires a
single bridge to complete a line to Brisbane
that would make some of the N. S. Wales
Northern settlers about: 600 miles nearer a
big city and a big market than they are.
and the bridge isn’t built. Yet the building
of it was a matter of agreement made 18
years ago, on the strength of which the
Queensland Government altered its coastal
line to eliminate the break of gauge. An
evidence of the absolute craving to open new
ports inside the State is shown in the fact
that the N. S. Wales North Coast line
absolutely goes out of its way to avoid Port
Stephens and keep it shut.
Outlying districts, in fact, have just fis
much hope of having decentralisation, in
sea trade, land trade or politics, “granted”
to them by the old Sydney (or Melbourne)
form of government as Brisbane and Mel-
bourne had in the old days, or as Russia
had of receiving a genuine Parliament from
its Czar; or Turkey a similar one from
Abdul Hamid; or as partitioned Poland had
of having its independence handed it by the
three Emperors on a lordly dish ; or as the
Armenians had of receiving a bouquet and
an illumiilated address from the young
Turks. Even railways aren’t likely to make
any real difference unless they are Federal
railways, or unless the districts concerned
can set up as separate States and have their
own railway management. Railways may
be granted as proof of a generous desire to
deal fairly with everybody and by way of
catching votes, but under the management
of the One Big City their real mission is to
fail and thereby prove that the One Big
City is the only possible place, after all.
Portland, with the finest harbor in Vic-
toria, has been “opened” by a crooked rail-
way which connects it. not with its own in-
land countrv. but with Melbourne, just as
the N. S. Wales North Coast ports are to


join .oil with Sydney. Also the, Portland
line has a scale of charges, fixed...in Mel-
bourne, to take away .trade, and an empty
bier which cost £85,000. Albany (W.A.J,
also .with a good harbor, was doing well till
Perth interests dropped to the fact, and
shifted the commercial watershed, xn other
words, the point at which charges wei e
equal northerly to Perth and southerly to
Albany, instead of being half-way between
the two places, was removed right into the
back yard of the mayor of Albany, so that
it almost paid him to send his ash-barrel
341 miles to the capital to be emptied in-
stead of doing the job himself. Portland
and Albany, with their railways and with
two of the finest harbors in Australia, had
2367 and 3699 inhabitants respectively at
last census! Jointly these promising cities
equalled one-fifth of Balmain (Sydney).
Newcastle has a genuine railway so far as
its coal business is concerned, and until the
coal-beds under Sydney itself are being fully
worked the One Big City has to put up with
Newcastle. But in everything except coal
the railway, under Sydney management, is
employed to take trade and people away from
the coaly town. Therefore these N. S. Wales
,*f>orts, north and south, which are going to
be “opened” needn’t give way to hysteria or
excitement. If they are “opened” by the old
method they may presently wish they had
been left shut.
WHAT HOES IT SPELL?
The after-ilinUef confidential Chat of it
British naval-officer with a French blue-
jacket at a Sydney bail in 1853 cost the
British Empire New Caledonia. Gtir Frehcb
friends had for tnan.y a day cast jonging
eyes on Capt. Cook’s discovery of 17114. So
had we. But the liiht giveii of oui- ihtentioii
to nnUek enabled oul- rivals to land and
take possession three hours before we b.diiie
on the scefie. Thlis we lost not only NetV
Caledonia and the adjacent isles, bht the
Loyalty Group and the New Hebrides ; for it
is an open secret that the throat of the im-
possible New Hebrides condominium will
soon be cut, and France will gather id this
gem of the Pacific, It may bring balm td
remember that, us the French beat us
on the post for NcW Caledonia, sd we beat
them by a ilose fOr Maoriland in almost
exactly the same Way,
But what a treasure island we bussed
When New Caledonia passed from us! SdinC
250 miles long by 80-odd broad, with a
superficial area of 0500 square miles, there
is probably the whole world Over no country
where shell masses of minerals have been
so heaped together. And nature in most
kindly mood has spewed most of these mid-
erals on the surface, so that they can be
exploited by economical open-cht or quarry.
Billions of tons of iron ore of high quality
skirt the seashore. Sixty per cent, of the
world’s insistent demand for nickel is sbp-
plied by New Caledonia. Vast deposits of
chrome abound ; manganese, cobalt, cinnabar,
copper, silver, lead and antimony ores are
available, not to mention coal near Noumea
and gold to the north of the island. And
there are seepages Of oil at Kdumae.
Until recently the mineral riches have
beeh almost monopolised by two powerful
companies. These are La Societe le Nickel
and BallaNdE et Flls. The Nickel Com-
pany, behind which are the Rothschilds,
owns 125,000 acres of nickel areas alone,
Ballande et Fils, mineowners and Colonial
traders, own about 45,000 acres. Both
companies run their own smelters. Before
the war the Nickel Company, with the metal
at five francs the kilo, had £2,000,000 re-
serve profits it could hot covet up. During
the war nickel climbed to 14 francs, and
Ballande et Fils are credited with profits
of several millions sterling. Heaven only
knows what the Nickel Company stacked
away.
But rivals have appeared upon the scene
from the Land of the Rising Sun, and honors
so far are to the Oriental. When East
meets West in a deal where cunning counts,
it is odds on the East.
Twenty years ago, in deference _ to Aus-
tralia’s protest, the stream of convict labor
ceased to flow from France to New Cal-
edonia. These mining millionaires had to
find a substitute for their white convict
slaves. In their distress they sought out
Japan, and there found the cheap labor they
wanted ; and it was willing to be bound for
a number of years. The pay was from five
to six francs a day, and for a time Jap
deference, docility and devotion to duty were
beyond all praise. The stream once started
soon became a rolling river. Never a boat
arrived from the Far East at Noumea but
aboard was a crowd of Japanese. They have
spread themselves all over the island, and
have adapted themselves to every form of in-
dustry. In a comparatively short time some
thousands have settled. It has become evi-
dent to a certain few who have rubbed
shoulders with the Jap in his native land
that nine-tenths of those arriving, though
camouflaged as coolies, have been soldiers,
and proud of their prowess. With each
squad of laborers have come three or four of
an officer type. And wherever these Japs
are located there is amongst them a strict
discipline. Every month brings regular re-
mittances from Tokio. from 80 to 40 pounds.
Many Japs were employed as workmen in the
erection of the nickel furnaces on the East
Coast of Noumea. Will it appear strange
that identical furnaces are to-day .smelting in
Japan, and that flanking the very entrance to
Noumea is a Japanese smelter, recently
erected, which with certain additions can
treat 500 tons of nickel ore daily?
Deep-sea fishing along the coast has
always had great attraction for the Japs:
their boats have sought out every mile of the
littoral. They could supply the French navy
with information about depth of water, cur-
rents and other matters of great interest.
They are most thorough fishermen.
How changed the attitude of the Jap to-
day ! When first he landed, none was more
deferential. Now, with a grip of the island
that few outside it realise, he is aggressive,
and if looks can visualise the Oriental mind
they loudly proclaim: “This bit of the earth
belongs to me!”
During the war. wealth that would have
made Crcesus float biinseif into a syndicate
has,poured jnto,,Japan, apd a little of it is
devoted to the;, peaceful penetration of New
Caledonia. Japan wants nickel and chrome and
jnanganese with whiqfa to harder; the,, plates
of her men-of-war and for hpr munitions. Ip
a marvellous manner, with a cleverness rhpt
does her infinite credit, she is possessing her T
self of what she so ardently desires. When
the awakening comes it will be discovered
that she has a stranglehold on New Cale-
donia. Her people are spread throughout the
length and breadth of the island. Their ten-
tacles are everywhere. Their fingers are in
every pie. Does this gradual absorption of
our nearby neighbor, with its minerals, its
harbors, its matchless strategic situation por-
tend good or evil for Australia? Some
who should speak with authority declare
that Japan’s dream is to dominate the
East; that her ambition is boundless. Can
we marvel if such should be? Korea, the
Carolines, Formosa and Shantung have
whetted her appetite. A small nation that
70 years ago was fighting with bows and
arrows, protecting her warriors with papier-
mache armor, and to-day builds dread-
noughts, with an empire of 400,000,000 in
leading strings, has already put up the
world’s record.

Pre-Selection v. Free Selection.
The) rooted objection. d£ the itiachine-poli-

whole TiiompsON-Briggs clan may ignqfe
the selection committees in future, believing
that it was the lack of those bodies’ disas-
trous approval that Secured Mood his Seat,
Preselection is, for all that, d necessary part
of the machine system. It instires subser-
vience. The party' ndinihation counts for a
considerable nhmber of votes; eVen if tile

speaking support of the big guns ,df the
paTty, or, rather, of the small guns that ate (
bigger than the mere pop-gtihs, for big artil-
iery is seatee these days. Probably it is
worth anything from £4OO to £2OOO as elec-
tion expenses which heedn’t appear in the
candidate’s retfirn. That is to say, under
the present system, and With no preferen-
tial vote, the independent candidate woujd
have to spend that atnOtlnt to biiy the pub-
licity that the Political machine supplies
gratis. And because the support of the
machine is So valuable; curious things used
to happen. Of course, they don’t happen ,
now. Once about 500 Voters Wrote out :
their applications for League membership (
in one room aUd sent the necessary shilling
or whatever it was from that room. Still,
they didn’t all give the room as their ad-
dress, for that would have looked like a
bad case of overcrowding. Nor did they
all sign themselves John SMITH, for some
people might have wondered at the preva-
lence of John Smiths. But though they
weren't all John Smiths on their applica-
tion forms, they were very unanimous in
choosing Jones as the party candidate, and
he remained in Parliament many years. The
big individualities whose names threaten to
live a while in political history didn’t get
into politics that way ; and because of the
previously-mentioned great power of the
machine, the big individualities who despise
its ways are not being replaced. Charles
Lilley ; Griffith, with his stately stalk
and pose; Mcllwraith ; John Robertson.
with his snuffle; Parkes ; Dibrs, who said
he didn’t damn Chicago; Reid ; Edmund
Barton; George Higinbotiiam ; Graham
Berry ; George Turner, the master of
the art of making Is. do the work of half-a-
crown; Alfred Deakin, Nature’s most-
finished gentleman ; Isaacs, one of the most
brilliant men that ever came from Palestine ;
big Charles Kingston ; Bigjohn Forrest
—consider such men being politically un-
dressed and inspected by a small crowd of
self-appointed busybodies in a cellar,
having previously signed a pledge that if
the busybodies didn’t like them in their
nude condition they would accept the rejec-
tion as final, and go away with their clothes
under their arm! No wonder Australia
grows weary of Pre-selection. It wants Free
Selection after survey—that is to say. it
wants to survey its candidate for itself.

In the Light of Experience.
“Pollio” on officering an army :
When Duntroon was started it was claimed proudly
to be “every bit as good as West Point.” It turns
out to have been doubtful praise. The U.S.
army administration, which is officered from West
Point, let down its troops from first to last. It
produced the most tortoise-like systems of supply,
the most inefficient and irrational rules of promotion,
that disgraced any army or any Defence Department
in the war. The reference is not, of course, to
administration in the field, but to the work of
army headquarters in the U.S. There was a captain
in one regiment so inefficient that he could only be
used as a billeting officer, which is a very junior
officer’s job ordinarily. Before the war was over
headquarters had promoted him step by step to full
colonel —and he was still a billeting officer! As
for supplies, the Yanks went into battle equipped
with Yankee rifles and everything else British or
French, even to the buttons on their uniforms. Their
machine-guns and aeroplanes were delayed in transit
until the wiseacres at Washington could invent purely
American types, and the troops had to borrow from
the Allies because the war wouldn’t stop till the
inventors were through. Lack of motor-transport
caused the death of thousands in the Argonne fight-
ing. The U.S. casualty reports were so centralised
that last October’s casualties were still, being pub-
lished in June. When it was represented to a high
West Pointer that British casualties were reported
direct from the hospital bases and divisional areas,
and thereby practically completed within a fort-
night, the answer was “Just because one army wears
red pants, that’s no reason why our army should
wear, red pants.”
..West JPojnf is now being freely blamed by repre-
9gn,t£five . lor these and couirtl£ss other
idiocies., TJie Governor, ( of Kansas Wfo’te r&e'ntiy r—

He has missed all the ..ojiportuijities;.,of becoming a
generally-informed citizen. He \youUj, be ( a .better
officer if he had taken a course in liberal education
in a civilian university, studied along With his'
other departments of knowledge the fundamentals,
of a military education, and gone to West Point for
a finishing course. His mingling with other citi-
zens in a civilian university life would have f? lvel }

professional 5ch001....N0 man should be peinnttea
to enter West Point until he has served a period
in the ranks and become acquainted with the rights
and duties of a private soldier from a private s point
of view.
Every word of this applies to Duntroon, though, in
point of, fact, our boys did what was asked of them
with remarkable success. War came, in their case,
before petrification had set in. As prophylactics
against hide-bound professional soldiers on the one
hand, and the amateurs, on the other, who had to
be pushed into military billets in desperation at
short notice, the Yanks are now contemplating a
number of changes. Chief among them are that
(a) National Guard {i.e., militia) officers and ie-
serve officers of proven ability should be admitted
to West Point and to staff colleges ; (b) profession-
ally trained officers should be detailed during peace
to work in telegraph offices, railways, factories, etc. ,
(c) staff officers should be so thoroughly trained that
their knowledge of mobilisation requirements should
include mobilisation of the country’s whole resources;
and “their intelligence should be similar to the best
intelligence of the leaders of industry” who had in the
end to be called in. And, again, it is up to Austra-
lia to follow suit. Modern warfare is a business
mart’s job—at any rate, in its highest reaches—and
any c'Otintry Which fails to realise the fact and
relies on the Old methods of evolving leaders is
going to squander mUeh money and many lives when
peace is hext fractured.

Eggfl.
In Melbourne suburbs last week the price of
new-laid eggs was Is. a dozen, which simple
fiict might serve as a text for a sermon on
profiteering. The prices of all other articles
of food have risen since the war. but the
best Of eggs are retailed at Is. a dozen when
Supplies ttre plehtiful, “the trade,” to its
great regret, being unable to prevent an
abundant supply of eggs when all the hens
are “oil the lay.” The production of food
from the hen is largely a cottage industry,
beyond the control of professional profiteers.
Blitter raisers are numerous, and a number
Of these tend to moderate the rapacity or
dealers by Selling their overplus to a select
dieilUle, btit in eoinparison with dairies the
fowl roosts are ttiUltittidinoUS; hence the im-
possibility of maintaining a high price for
eggs all the seasons round, or of ever cre-
ating a famine in “the trade” —in this coun-
try. at any rate. Besides, among the tens
of thousands of hen-keepers a large majority
make a point of limiting their consumption
when the supply drops off. They never buy
"shop” eggs; therefore they are never vic-
timised by “the trade,” and it is owing in a
measure to the abstinence of these citizens
that the people who have to buy “shop
eggs are only moderately victimised
at the worst of times. Profiteering
is just what the customers make it. If they
abstain from buying luxuries and hat-
necessaries at exorbitant prices they can t be
profiteered. If a customers’ union, with
branches in every district, decided to buy-
slow always, and go on strike sometimes,
against conspicuously unreasonable prices,
they would reduce the cost of living within
a week. William Morris Hughes, talking
of how the Government is going to deal with
profiteers, wastes the breath he should enjoy
in bidding the public bring abstinence to bear
on the situation for just a little while, ft is
the constant opportunity to profiteer that
makes profiteering done. Special first-night
and Saturday-night prices are charged at the
theatres because the public persist in rush-
ing the theatres on first nights and Satur-
days. The prices of innumerable articles at
the shops have been raised, not they
are absolute necessities at the moment, but
because the purchasers will buy them- Lney
are being compelled to pay through the nose
for their self-indulgence, whereas, u
they would regulate their desires toi
most things as they regulate their con-
sumption of eggs, they would have very little
profiteering to complain of, and no vain
promises of reform from a vociferous 1 rime
Minister to make them tired.
Street Bands and Suffering Burghers.
One curious effect of the inclination of a
large section of the public to shout for the
Digger, and of the Digger's inclination to
shout for everybody, is a vast increase in
the tally of street bands in every Australian
city. Just as one type of man when he loses
his job takes to drink, so another joins a
band or becomes a solo instrumentalist.
It does not concern him that he knows
nothing of music, and has no taste for it.
The artistic temperament is rather a handi-
cap in the street-music trade, success in
which is largely a matter of the survival of
the most impudent. The business in its
present form was originated by the Ilun.
who borrowed and improved upon the
methods of the Dago organ-grinder of half
a century ago. The faint, whining melodies
which the heir of the Oassars poured from
his instrument like thin oil were replaced
by crashing marches and waltz numbers.
The self-abasing monkey with his pannikin
departed, and a truculent six-foot Saxon
wielding a clerical collection-box took the
animal’s place. The war freed Australia of
these invaders; but it promises to give the
country more and worse music than the most
incompetent of the Boche instrumentalists
ever inflicted on it. The self-respecting type
of able-bodied Australian is not built to earn
his living this way. We have, therefore,
roughly, three main varieties of noise-
makers: (1) Bands composed of sol-
diers, some disabled, a few fit; (2)
bands composed of musical or other
civilians who mostly go in for banding
because it is an effortless existence, lived to
a great extent in the vicinity of bars, and
because they hop# , t6' he mistaken for
damaged soldiers, with 1 gfea't profit to' them-
selves; and (3) blind soldiers’ hands, Th#
last should be cut out altogether; n't/ /rtari
who has lost his sight in the service of the'
country should be forced, or even encouraged,
to depend for his living upon street collec-
tions. With regard to the others, they are
controlled only in the matter of stands The

»
Mildura—the Coming State.
Dear Bulletin, — I have just seen the par.
about Mildura and myself. Permit me to
answer: —
(1) It is true that a motion was put, at a public
meeting of Mildura business men, and duly carried,
attinning that it was desirable to secure my services
for the purpose of organising a new State.
(2) It is not true that I “proposed that I should
be appointed to lead Mildura to its destiny for a
remuneration of £lOOO per annum.” I never intro-
duced the personal financial question at all. But
C. J. De Gakis, the Publicity Director, did. He
asked how much I wanted. And, having carefully
sized-up Mr. De Gauis, I simply said: “Whatever Mr.
De Gakis gets, as Publicity Director for the A.D.F.A.,
I want twice as much —I am twice as able a man
as he.” Mr. De Gauis then said: “I get £5OO
plus a commission.” I replied: “All right, twice that
amount will do me.”
(3) It is true that I discussed the Australian
Dried Fruits Association. But 1 don’t think “this
was bad tactics,” for the A.D.F.A. requires discussion.
Why? Well these are some of the queries which I
addressed to Mr. De Gauis, and which have not been
answered: —
(а) Why does it cost from 17J to 20 p.c. to
deliver the Mildura dried-fruit producers’ goods to
the consumer? (b) Gould not a well conducted co-
operative concern render the same service for 5
p.c. ? (c) Are such high overhead charges designed
for the growers’ benefit, or for that of the host of
agents who act as go-betweens? (d) For instance,
is it a fact that 5 p.c. of the fixed selling price
on all A.D.F.A. products goes to the wholesale
agent or broker approved of by the A.D.F.A.? (e)
Is it a fact that another 5 p.c., plus id. per lb., or
equal to another 2i p.c., goes to the wholesale mer-
chant? (f) Is it a fact that the “tied” retail
grocer gets a rebate of id. per lb., or equal to 5
p.c., provided that he obeys orders, and does not.
sell non-members’ products? (s) If these percen-
tages total 17| p.c., who are the profiteers? (h)
If these facts were fully known, plus certain other
facts, what would an efficient Price-Fixing Com-
mission have to say? (i) For instance, suppose that
a co-operative growers’ concern, superseding the
A D.F.A., were to cut out just one commission of
jd per lb., what would be the result? Taking the
Mildura-Merbein product of dried fruits at 10,000
tons, one single cut-out of id. per lb. would mean
an increased return to the growers of £60,000.
(j) Would Mr. De Garis object to that? (k) If
not, would he kindly explain who gets that £60,000
n °(4) it is true that I asked a whole lot of other
interesting questions. But Mr. De Gauis, having
said that he would answer the whole lot, entirely
omitted to answer any one of them.
(5) My case for a new Australian State, based
upon Miidura, is absolutely sound. I take Ohio,
in the U.S., as the pattern for my proposed State.
Ohio —area 39,964 sq. miles—was wholly settled!
by American returned soldiers, at the close of the
American Revolutionary War. The North-West
Ordinance was passed by Congress, providing for
the creation of a local Legislature as soon as the
population of Ohio Territory reached 5000. How
did it work out? Well, Cincinnatti was founded ini
1788. And Ohio was admitted, as the first in-
terior State of the Union, in 1803. There was goodl
reason, because the population had already begun’
to jump in thousands. And it kept on jumping:.
1810, 230,000; 1850, 1,980,329; 1870, 2,665,000;:
1880, 3,198,000; 1890, 3,672,000 ; and to-day,
4,500,000.
(б) Why shouldn't we build an Ohio here? Or
two or three of them ? It isn’t a mere question of
boosting Mildura alone. AY hat about Alburj ?
This policy is simply the New Decentrali-
sation. And I call upon Tiie Bulletin to
support it tooth and nail. I call upon W. M.
Hughes also, if he means business, to sup-
port this scheme. I call upon every Aus-
tralian to push this big and practical idea.
Because it is right; not because the idea is
mine. As for myself, I simply claim the
status of an ordinary active man. When I
was in prison I tried to get permission to
go to the war. Pearce would not do any-
thing. Neither would Fisher. So I made up
my mind to do my time, improve what
brains I possess to the utmost, and then,
when I got my chance, go at Mildura with
a great scheme- —something really worth
while, on behalf of Australian returned sol-
diers. That proposition still stands. With
this difference —that Mildura, side-tracked
for the moment by Mr. DE Garis, tempo-
rarily lost its Head. Now, face to face with
my scheme again, it finds that my price has
gone up with a leap. For I now demand
£lO.OOO per annum, half of it in advance. I
would have been satisfied with £lOOO at the
start; but I have raised it to £lO,OOO in
order to teach Mildura the cash-difference
between the real value of a C. J. De Garis
and of yours, Grant Madison Harvey.

its assets. Its unwillingness to welcome people who

in other lands have had no fair chance in life is
not an asset. Neither “White Australia” nor
“Selfish Australia”' is anythin" for a Christian man
to boast about —or for an atheist either. What is
more, this country needs a radical change in its
economic policy if it is ever going to be any good
either for itself or the world. The true policy for
Australia is one that will recognise that this enor-
mous continent is in the tropics as well as the
temperate zone; that Nature means it for white
men's brains and colored men’s muscles, for workers
who can stand the heat and others who love best
the cold.
Just what the Mercury’s beloved and alto-
gether admirable “children of the sun” will
think of alleged friends who prescribe slave
standards for the colored races and would
convert a proud non-Christian race into a
biddable band of muscular Christian helots
for Australia’s economic salvation—well, it
can only be guessed at.

Can Australia Keep White Without
Sugar?
Dear 8.,- —Because the maintenance of the
sugar industry in the North is of great
national value to White Australia you will
let me put in a plea for the sugar-growers
of Queensland anent the campaign down
south for cheaper sugar. At the present
time, owing to the large demands made by
labor (it is no uncommon thing for cane-
cutters to earn up to £l2 per week right
through a season of seven months, at award
rates), only the very best land can be cul-
tivated. Inferior and average land is gradu-
ally going out of use, and by reason of the
competition for the good land it is rising in
value. Mills that a few years ago were
crushing 300,000 tons of cane annually
are now putting through from 60,000
to 70,000 tons. Australia in a generation
has only once produced the quantity
of sugar it can consume. This year it
will be over 100,000 tons short. While
the war was on foreign sugar could
not be imported for less than about 40 p.c.
above the price fixed for Australian-grown
sugar. But now the war 'is over our im-
porting friends down south want the duty
taken off the local article, so that they may
in future land black-grown sugar at cheaper
rates. Every man, woman and child in the
Commonwealth consumes on an average
about 3201 b. of sugar annually. Let us say
211 b. a week each. A man with a wife and
tour children thus requires 151 b. liaise the
price a farthing per lb., and he would have
to pay under 4d. a week extra. If this far-
thing per pound were passed back the
growers would receive £2 6s. per ton extra
for their raw sugar. They now receive £2l.
It takes about 10 tons of cane to make one
ton of sugar, so the farmer would receive
about 4s. 6d. more for his cane. This 4s. Od.
would mean double the number of small
farmers; at least 40 p.c. extra production,
and employment for a large extra number
of men. The janj-makers may use half a
pound of sugar to a pound of jam. The
extra cost would involve them in only one-
eighth of a penny for each pound of
their product. This is included in the
family man’s weekly expenditure of 4d.
extra. If the southern jam-makers and
their friends gain their ends and the
price of raw -sugar goes down. it
must close up a number of sugar-mills. Even
under present conditions three out of about
a dozen in North Queensland have locked up
for good, ( and others are very nearly settled.
There are farmers who can afford to put
large areas under cane and who are still
making big money by reason of their very
large turnover. But they are few and far
between and are not the sort the country
vvants. N. Queensland (especially the coast
line) must have population if Australia is
to be safe; and so far sugar-growing is the
only large industry which has shown any
success in that region. In the Cairns dis-
trict it keeps about 15,000 people. If an
extra £2 per ton can be got for raw sugar,
the benefits of that increase going to the
actual growers, the land under cultivation
will double in two years, with a correspond-
ing increase in population. And it will be
good population, too—mostly small farmers
and their employees. But if the price is
lowered £2, then the industry will at the
least be in grave peril of complete abandon-
ment. —Yours, Alidade.
Uncle Sam’s Trade War.
While an effort, is being made in the Com-
monwealth to encourage the use of Aus-
tralian-made goods through an extensive
publicity campaign which avoids, any men-
tion of the one practical means Of assuring
it. over in America much more business-
like action is being taken to enforce the
consumption in Australia of American-made
goods. With heaps of money made out of
the war, the country of high .Protection has
been busy forming amalgamations and com-
panies for foreign trading. In May alone
corporations were formed with capital run-
ning into £150,000,000. and in the first five
months of the year such capital amounted
to £490,000,000. A New York financial
journal, reviewing this movement, states
that every industry is represented in the
determination of the manufacturers to make
their mark in the great trade war.” If Aus-
tralia is satisfied merely with patriotic
?.°H < l es in , t rams and ferry-boats exhorting
itself to buy home-made goods, it will feel
the mark all right. And that Australia is
mapped out for attack is obvious. Eloquent
signs of American penetration” are to be
met in almost every big hotel, and the pene-
tiators are not here for the good of their
health. American industries of all sorts are
on. the warpath, and there are disquieting
rumors or the possible acquisition of Aus-
tralian newspapers and Australian banks to
assist in the dumping of American products.
Already the cocky is being cheered with
the joyous news that America will provide
an enormous market for his raw material,
and that he should prepare to become the
wood-and-water joey for that country in the
near future. While the plan of campaign
is obvious the remedy is even more directly
in sight, and it takes the definite form of
an effective tariff that will cause the local
consumer to use Australian-made goods be-
cause he can get them cheaper than similar
imported golds. No campaign in favor of
Australian_ goods that does not have that
for its objective has any permanent value

worth mentioning; and the results from
anything else must be more impermanent
than usual in view of the present vigorous
attack from America.
Postal “economy” has sent a N. S. Wales
widow, the mother of four young children,
to gaol for six months. She used to get £3
per week; but this was reduced to £2 Is.,
and on this she struggled to keep her babies
fed and clothed. Of course, when things
went against her she failed to do it - y and
with the Savings Bank money passing
through her hands, the distressed woman
did what some of the best mothers in the
world would do —forgot everything but her
children. Her conduct may show that she
is unfit for the job she had. But. unless
there are circumstances that have not been
disclosed, the gaol doors ought to promptly
open to release her.
“Motan” : “M.F.” deservedly, albeit. I
think, unconsciously, criticises (B. 4/9/T9)
the Tropical Institute of Medicine at Towns-
ville. He says: “What we do need and need
very badly is an institute for research work
in tropical diseases”—and that amounts to
a_ well-merited slur on the present institu-
tion which lias been in existence for a decade
and accomplished practically nothing. The
public of Australia does not seem to realise
that opportunities for research work are
allowed to sjip by owing to the stagnation
policy pursued by the institution. The Com-
momvealth Government spends £4OOO a year
on the supposition that a large amount of
work on tropical diseases is carried out at
Townsville. What is the position? The
first and present director of the Institute is
an imported Austrian (since naturalised),
a man clever but jealous of his own know-
ledge, who seemingly dreads that if he tells
what he knows other people will know as
mueh as he; and if that does not mean
that he cares more for his own knowledge
than for the health of the human race, what
can it signify? Add to this that the mini-
mum amount of work has been, and is
being, done in regard to tropical research,
that keen medical men who have gone to
work in the Institute are held back from
following lines of their own, with the final
result that the Rockefeller Institute, with
its keen enthusiasts, comes to Australia and
commences on a most thorough examination
and elimination of the hookworm disease
(ankylostomiasis) in North Queensland—a
work which should have been done by our
own Institute at its commencement. And
hookworm is not the Only tropical disease in
Queensland which is taking its toll of young
Australia, and which has not been investi-
gated thoroughly by our Government-run
research institution. With right direction
the Australian Institute of Tropical Medi-
cine would be a thing for Australians not
only to be proud of but to be thankful for.
“Tatana”: The introduction of native
taxation in Papua caused the haughty brown
man to sit up, and many and strange were
the reasons he gave to account for the in-
novation. Quite the most common one was
that the money collected was to go to Lord
Jellicoe as a gift in celebration of his vic-
tory over the Diamens’ (Germans’) war-
canoes ; but this idea was rapidly dispelled
when the fact penetrated the heathen’s
thick head that his shell-out would be a
yearly one. The tax, which has been asses-
sed at £1 per annum for all able-bodied
natives who are bachelors or (if married)
with less than four living children, or half
this sum if under indenture to European em-
ployers, will, as a matter of fact, form the
nucleus of a fund for the education of
Papua’s rising native population in English.
Existing native schools under the control of
the various missions will be granted support
by the fund, which will be administered by
a Board composed of officials and members
of the various missions interested. A scheme
of technical education may eventually be
financed from the tax.
“It is a pity some of them didn’t sink
the ships in Sydney Harbor. It is what I
would do anyhow,” said Page in the Federal
House of Reps., speaking of the naval
mutineers. If that is what he would do
there are the makings of a very promising
criminal in Mr. Jim Page.
Nicholson, M.L.C., has persuaded his
branch of the Westralian Parliament to pass
an amending Divorce Bill, the chief feature
being the inclusion of ante-nuptial incon-
tinence among the grounds for untying the
knot. But, as you might be sure, that pro-
vision is to apply only to the lady.
“F.C.”: These headlines are a fraud ! See-
ing one the other day, “Daring Escape of
Six Criminals,” I rushed to buy a paper,
expecting to read of a raid on profiteers with
the escape of a half-dozen; but it was merely
a paltry tale of six petty larcenists cutting a
hole in the bottom of a Black Maria and
falling out.
An Anti-Shouting Bill is before S. Aus.
Assembly. But its introduction met with
much merriment. It had the disadvantage
of being introduced by Peter Allen, the
recognised humorist of the Plouse, and his
fellow-members could not be convinced that
he was serious now. And perhaps he
wasn’t. Anyhow, he told the history of an
anti-shouting club at Quorn, which lasted
for some years—until one by one the mem-
bers left the town.
“Dial Sight” : Having jettisoned the Cen-
sor, the Defence Department is now going to
the other extreme. Prominently displayed
for sale in a Melbourne shop-window is an
array of plans of the military survey of Aus-
tralia, an inch to the mile, issued by the
Department, and containing many particu-
lars' that a nation with predatory intentions
towards this country would wish to possess.
It is perhaps natural that a Department
which went to such foolish extremes during
a war should now be as foolish in putting a
possible invader wise as to the exact lay of
our country, and whether certain water-
courses have wooden or iron bridges over
them —all for a modest Australian bob.
Federal Laborites are pressing for fur-
ther inquiry into the Shaw Wireless scandal.
Sinister rumors are getting encouragement
from the Government’s reluctance to reopen
the subject. As a matter of fact, Watt and
his brethren were never enthusiastic about
the first Commission, and from their nervous
attitude one suspected a desire that the
examination shouldn’t go too far. Rightly or
wrongly, there is a growing feeling that ex-
Senator Long and Jens Jensen were not the
only actors in the drama, and while Labor
jeers that the' Government daren't grant
another inquiry, Government supporters be-
gin to sniff and demand further particulars.
Meantime Dr. Maloney has given a sensa-
tional twist to the business by suggesting
that the late Shaw should be exhumed to see
if he perished from unnatural causes!
. The question of free screech was involved
ill the Ccisc of Jones, MJj.A., wlio, being
fined a third time for holding forth on Fre-
mantle Esplanade, took sanctuary in Parlia-
ment House. The question wasn’t about
what Jones said, but about the fact that he
insisted on saying it, whatever it was. on a
busy highway. It was resolved at a Labor
rally that the matter should be fought-out
to the bitter end and that the supporters of
freedom were behind Jones to a man. Quite
a large question is involved, for somebody
might, insist, if Janos’s plea holds good, on
making harmless but lengthy religious obser-
vations on the railway line when the express
is due, and taking up a collection from the
passengers, or the freedom of the press
might be vindicated by printing the paper in
the middle of the street. A new paper would
get a tremendous advertisement that way,
but it would be bad for traffic. Too many of
the things done in the name of Liberty "are
untidy.
Victoria’s House of Fats and Semi-Fats
has just passed a Bill that is to put the
kicking-strap on. the defaulting husband and
father who will not support his family. In
future, instead of being released from gaol
at the behest of a forgiving and hopeful wife,
he is to furnish a bond, with sureties, before
the doors are opened. It doesn’t look much
of an improvement on the present plan, be-
cause that sort of individual isn’t as a rule
likely to obtain sureties, so he will mostlv
stop where he is, while the country keeps
him and either the deserted wife works for
herself and the kiddies as before or the
State supports the lot. The simple, efficacious
plan would be to make him work in gaol,
and work hard, applying his surplus earn-
ings to the upkeep of his family. But that
course entails a little administrative work,
and isn’t half as easy as passing Amending
Acts. Besides, there is always a howl about
“cheap prison labor,” and howls are liable
to cost votes. And to the mere politician
votes are the most important thing in the
world.

An«l yet some people expect the youthful Australian
Iron and Steel Industry to compete on even terms
against the giant enterprises of Europe and America.
When the Australian Industry is full-grown it will
be able to stand up against the competition of the
world—on eciual terms, or anything like equal terms,
it fears no competitor.
But at present the terms are not equal. The Aus-
tralian Industry is young and is heavily handicapped
—is paying high wages—heavy transport charges—
high prices for materials —and it lias only a com-
paratively small output.
The Australian Iron and Steel Industry wants to
be allowed to work its hardest for the people and
for the future of Australia.
It wants to help build Australia into a great nation
—to make Australia self-reliant and self-supporting
—to make Australia safe from attack from without
—to make plenty of employment for Australian
citizens.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The debate on the Peace Treaty gave a
great opportunity for that hen-cackle which
is politics. Australia had more voice than it
ever expected in making the treaty. The
thing being made it had to be accepted in
full, for this country couldn’t reject it and
continue the war alone, nor could it call
another convention and draft a new. treaty.
The cackling was all wasted and everybody
knew it was wasted. Yet Ministers wlio
should have been in their offices drafting the
new tariff or struggling with the finances sat
for hours listening and counting the flies on
the ceiling. There were 10 Hies to begin with
but two more joined them later on, and then
one got tired and left. It was a whole essay
on the absurdity of Ministers having seats
in Parliament.
N. S. Wales Nationalist Conference sitting
at Sydney and sawing up planks for its
platform was unanimous about this: —
That it be a plank in the National Association
platform that the seat of the Federal Government be
removed from. Melbourne to Canberra, as provided by
the Federal Constitution.
The Federal Constitution doesn’t provide for
removing the seat of Government to Can-
berra. In fact, it doesn’t mention Canberra
at all, and it no more provides for removing
even the ash-barrel to Canberra than to
Cawker’s Well.
Wonderfully bland and childlike, is Queens-
land’s Ryan Ministry. When the Assembly
came to that clause in the Blank Cheque
Bill which provides that a Council consist-
ing mostly of the Premier and his nominees
may order any employer to do anything it
considers proper for the reduction of real
or alleged unemployment, Macartney and
others remarked that it was a big order.
Minister Theodore replied that it was all
right. “No sane Government” would mis-
use the proposed powers. It doesn’t seem
a reason for giving a blank cheque to pos-
sibly demented Governments. If a Bill was
introduced giving unlimited powers to hit
Theodore on the head with a brick, and
Theodore was comforted with the assurance
that no good man would hit the Treasurer
on the head with a brick, just how comforted
would Theodore feel?
From the N. S. Wales Gallery:—
N. S. Wales Leg. Assembly grows more frowsy
and disreputable-looking. The mental level of the
place is that of a saloon bar; but it looked more
like the trup’ny bar one morning last week.
Fourteen hours at a stretch had been passed snarl-
ing over the estimates. Everybody was dog-tired.
All were irritable. Some were boozed. Some
were in that dirty frame of mind which comes with
half-sobriety. A Minister and a garrulous advocate
of Labor had been taking nip for nip all night,
though there was a suspicion that Labor was beaten
for the last spot on the concluding bottle. Anyway,
when total-abstainer and Minister for Housing Davy
frankly disgusted with his surroundings, moved
the gag, Labor stood up and declared “You
over there; blankety ruddiness and blazes take you
blighters,” it was felt that the tiine was ripening
for someone to get punched on the nose. Hall got
it first. Then Labor was collared round the ankles
and up-ended, and 11 leading democrats and other
individuals fell in a heap on the carpet. Cleaning
up the mess took about five minutes, whereupon,
without apology or explanation, they passed half a
million and wandered out for breakfast or hops,
according to taste. It is to maintain this refuge
for muddling, not to say maudlin, incompetency that
the taxpayers pay scores of thousands a year, while
eloquent blither against interfering with State
sovereignty is poured over the land by Joe Car-
ruthers and Holman. Slay the Lord have mercy
on them!
The impending Maoriland election pro-
mises to be a drab business. When Joe Ward
pulled out of the National Ministry he
dressed his shop-window cleverly, but it was
mostly with the same old loan promises. On
the Reform side the prospects held out by
Massey are about as cheerful as a ton of pig-
iron. The third team with a card of events
is Labor; and Labor’s tendency is to make
a legislator of every Labor man who has
been in gaol. The various welfare and pro-
gress and square-deal leagues which pro-
moted themselves recently have blown out
at the first rough place in the road.
The always-burning-with-philanthropy Dr.
Maloney stated in the House of Reps, last
week that he would “never cast a vote to
saddle posterity with the huge debt the war
had left’’; so wealth should be levied on to
pay the bill. But the trouble is that if
wealth is levied on in a sudden fashion it
can only pay by selling its property either to
poor men who can’t buy or to rich men who
can’t buy either because they are also busy
selling. And if they could buy the payment
would be in Federal notes, that being
only currency; and the great debtor in Eng-
land won’t give a penny for a bushel of our
VIRTUE TRIUMPHANT.
“Something more than Australian interests have to be considered, and something infinitely more
than the selfish interests of a section which hopes to derive some advantage from a high turift."
THE OLD LADY : “Begone, sir! Thank Heaven, there are still people with sufficient
sense of their duty to unprotected innocence to save this maiden from the machi-

notes. He will take almost anything we like
to produce by hard work —cotton, oil, boots,
wool, clothes, flax, jute, salt, silk; lie isn t
particular what he takes in payment of our
debts save that he won’t take our paper
monev. Of course estates might be confis-
cated' and sold to people in England for
gold, which our English creditor would
accept, or for English notes, which the Eng-
lish creditor would also accept. But then
posterity w T ould be “saddled” with the debt
just the same or in a worse form, only it
would owe rent to the absentee landlord
instead of interest to the absentee bond-
holder. Wherefore this paper fears that the
dear old philanthropist will have to realise
that there is no remedy for debt except hard
work.
The liberty of the subject to nurse in
secret and spread his or her (particularly
her) syphilis is being urged strenuously by
some good ladies of both sexes in W.A. The
V.D. Act gives the Commissioner of Health
power to act upon confidential information,
but it was stipulated that Parliament should
review the matter after a certain period,
and the Leg. Council has agreed that the
clause should be a permanent part of the
Act. The frenzied females who have been
making noises on behalf of free syphilis re-
ceived a blow when Dr. Saw voted for the
permanence of the contentious clause. When
the measure was originally introduced, be-
fore he left on active service, Saw deemed
the provision unnecessary, if not positively
objectionable. Experience abroad of the
working of the local Act convinced him that
the measure as it has stood for the last 12
months is good, which about settled the
matter so far as the Leg. Council is con-
cerned.
This is about how the Hun-Yankee war
stands now :
The U.S. Senate has turned up its joint and
several nose at the Paris treaty and drafted a new
one.
The Allies having accepted the old treaty don t
feel like starting the whole weary negotiation afresh.
Also, they have fears about disturbing the bargain.
They have to live in the middle of the turmoil
while the U.S. looks at it calmly thousands of miles
away, and to unsettle all the nerve-racked nations
again might start a dozen combatants on a ( fresh
war.
It isn't their business to drag Germany to a
new Peace Conference with the U.S. The U.S.
wasn’t even an ally, so it must do its own
dragging.
If the U.S. is an inefficient dragger it and the
Hun must remain at war.
On the other hand, having blown off some of
its hot air, it may accept the treaty. It probably
will. It has to get rid of that hot air some way.
Another word about the Anzac tweed
industry was said to Hughes last week by
Sergeant Sinclair, manager of the little fac-
tory in Melbourne. Sinclair offers, if Hughes
will see that the Federal Woollen Mills,
which belong to the people of Australia, sup-
ply him with an adequate quantity of yarn,
to' furnish the public with hand-woven.
Digger-made tweed, of single width, at is. Od.
per yard; to tailors at 6s. per yard—practi-
cally pre-war prices. He can then still, he
alleges, pav better than wages-bonrd rates.
Milieu and his importing friends will have a
job to find an answer to this challenge, and
if Hughes turns the proposal down—well,
rim Diggers’ vote is something to be reckoned
with now.
When winnowed the only grain yielded by
the first progress report of the Vic. Profiteer-
ing Commission is a majority recommenda-
tion that a Prices Court should be estab-
lished. So mixed up was this proposal w’ith
the husk of statement and argument as to
what the Interstate Commission found and
advised that it required a close mesh to
capture it. The interpretation put on the
recommendation is that the Commission itself
should be converted into a Prices Court.
Mills, the Doctor of Economics on the Com-
mission, would not go as far as McCay and
Williams, believing that there was no proved
warrant for doing more than directing at-
tention to the undue profit-taking already
exposed by the Interstate Commission.
Prendergast has been heckling the Ministry
as to what it is going to do about the report,
which was in hand several days before it
was made public. The dissension in the
Commission is, however, a small thing com-
pared with that in the Cabinet.
Cussen, J.. is to inquire whether influ-
ence, political, social or Masonic, was used
by anybody to have charges of fraud and
forgery originally proposed to be levelled
against John Blacker, of Mornington (Vic.),
reduced to larceny as a bailee. Following
Hogan’s complaint action was delayed owing
to the serious illness of Arthur Robinson,
Solicitor-General, who handled the case.

not satisfied it could challenge the Govern-
ment for its administration of the Law
Department, but it wasn’t going to allow any
commission to deal with a matter of that
kind. Lawson’s -attitude would be perfectly
right but for one thing. He knows, just as well
as the next man. that no vote taken in the
House on such a question will be governed
by the merits of the case. will
vote, not on the evidence, but at the crack
of the party whip.
It is absurd to complain that the Hughes
Cabinet has done nothing for the tariff.
After two and a half years’ study it has
decided to put semolina on the free list.
Cocky is being scratched very earnestly
in S. Aus., too, and the Nationalists think
they will get him off a perch of his own into
their cage. For a start, anyway, they have
got J. M, McDonald, of the Burra, a direc-
tor of the Farmers’ Union, to take the pre-
sidency of the Liberal Union, mostly held
hitherto by city lawyers. The struggle of
thb two old parties to keep every other party
out of the iield is pathetic. Still it is un-
derstandable in the case of Labor. It knows,
anyway, from its own early experience, what
a tremendous power a third party has.
“Gallery” : Senator Millen’s recent threat
of retirement from the Repat. Department
started tongues wagging of two or three pos-
sible? who are ready to break their hearts
in the billet. If the job must be given to a
Representative and a soldier, Abbott has the
recommendations of impartiality and acumen.
Captain S. M. Bruce has been mentioned, but,
apart from his magnificent inexperience,
he seems to have come into certain pre-
judices with his money. The best man for
the post is probably Arthur Rogers, who was
one of the fathers of the Wannon (Vic.)
repatriation scheme during the war period,
and revealed prodigious energy in the direc-
tion thereof. Rogers’s knowledge of the
business is accompanied by a fine, frank
modesty and engaging affability, but In*
needs a course in political engineering to
emerge from the ruck of the also-rans.
Sheepbreeder Philip Russell, of Mawallok
(Vic. western district), speaking at the
recent Ballarat sheep show: —
If the Government is going to burst up large
estates, it is going to burst up the nucleus of all
the sheep to be wanted in the world in years to
come.
Well, in Maoriland since 3880 the number
of small holdings (320 acres to 1000 acres)
has more than doubled, while holdings of
from 30,000 acres to 40,000 acres have been
so “burst up” that five-sixths of them have
disappeared; yet between 1880 and 1017
Maoriland’s flocks nearly doubled, and a few
fats are supposed to have been sold at a
pretty good price meantime. In Maoriland,
too, there has been more of the actual re-
sumption of estates on which high-class sheep
were bred than there is auy talk of in
Australia. Here the worst that nationally-
valuable breeders like the Russells have to
fear is taxation ; and that apparently hasn't
pauperised them so far.
The Vic. Labor ox at last begins to show
a. desire to get rid of its ticks, such as the
Red Flag party and the 0.8. U. To certain
“unfair criticism” which lately appeared in
the Socialist, the Labor Call printed a
snorting rejoinder by the Seamen’s Council:
We know our own business, and are as well able
to direct that business as our critics, whose purpose
mav be to serve an ideal which they may use others
to attain, by spurring them on, not counting the-
cost.
The 0.8. U, Herald also had itself spanked
in the same issue of the official Labor
journal. It may be the result of a sin-
cere desire on the part of democratic Labor
to be true to its own principles, as pledged
to • the electors; or, again, it may merely
indicate that an election is approaching.
Even the most earnest advocate of 1-1-liberty
can’t but recognise that the 0.8. U. and Red
Flag party, with Bolshistraws in their hair,
don’t look like helpful campaign companions.
There are apparently just two reasons
why the Anzac tweed industry has been
hampered by those who ought to encourage
it. One is that it would interfere with the
business of the great Australian god Im-
ports ; the other is that, as the consumer
could deal directly with the producer, it is
no good to the middleman. That, anyhow,,
is a fair deduction after considering the case-
of P. Sennett, of Geelong, who was wounded
at Gallipoli and discharged in October, 1916,
In January, 1917, he set out to learn the-
hand-loom weaving business, and in April,.
1917, he‘applied to the Repat. Department
for a loom. In March, 3.919, the gradual
Department got him a loom. That was six
months ago; and since then, though ill for
five weeks, he has paid for his plant and
his yarn, and, selling his cloth direct to a
firm of Melbourne drapers, has made for
himself £l4O, or over £7 a week! On capital
that knocks out wheat-growing and even
hen-raising. His profits would be higher
still but for the fact that he has to get his
yarn from the weaving school in Melbourne.
It is manufactured at the Federal Mills in
Geelong, but Red Tape has decided that it
must go to Melbourne first.

“Work work, work! The primal necessity to
national salvation is work .’’—Mr. Hughes.
He was a busy little man,
Keen eyed and sharp of face,
And with abundant zeal he ran
About the troubled place.
On every hand they heard his cry
No, not “Excelsior!”
But “Work! Work! Work!” His throat was dry,
The zealot’s fire consumed his eye,
But every wind that thundered by
Ilis splendid gospel bore.
In crowded streets he lifted up
His shrill, appealing voice.
“Cast down your pleasures, drop the cup 1
Ye people, take your choice—
Destruction, with starvation’s stress,
If industry you shirk,
Or high salvation quick to bless
Your land if you will loiter less,
Nor lean in wanton idleness.
Oh, work, work, work, WORK l”
To country places most remote
He bore his banner fine.
Those riding on the rails he smote
With burning words. His sign
He set aloft. From every part
Did eager people walk ;
Great distances they came by cart,
Left factory, and store, and mart,
And all their labor, light of heart,
To sit and hear him talk 1

Reserves capitalised, £25,000 .. 189,9al
Since 1913 an amount equal to over three-
quarters of the paid capital has been handed
out in divs., but the reserved profits are so
large in proportion to capital that the in-
terest on investments alone has more than
covered each term’s distributions to share-
holders. This means that the whole of the
underwriting surpluses, and a little from
investments besides, have strengthened the
fund which is the policy-holders’ protection.
While other Australasian offices built up
shareholders’ capital out of accumulated sur-
pluses—eight cos. increased their capital by
f 1.630,008 during the past 20 years, and
£1,550,008 of that total came out of un-
divided profits—this Dunedin co. went on
piling up visible reserves until they
nmounted to almost three times the paid
capital. This policy, which has restricted
shareholders’ dividends, has put the Standard
on a very solid footing; but to make only
the earnings of investments available to
shareholders has lately meant a dividend rate
which might be misunderstood by people un-
acquainted with the conservative policy of
the directors. So at last it has been decided
to do a little capitalising of reserves,
£25,000 being utilised to tack ss. to each of
the £lO shares paid to 15s. Paid capital
will now be £lOO,OOO, leaving £189,951. in
reserves. Even on this increased capital last
year’s earnings from investments alone were
sufficient to provide a div. at the rate of
P-e.
To the policy-holder it does not matter
much whether the funds of an insurance
office are in the form of shareholders’ capital
or are held mostly in reserves. If he has
any choice he would probably prefer to see
them capitalised, for then they cannot be
distributed as a cash bonus among share-
holders. What concerns him most, though,
is the extent of the co.’s resources compared
with its risks. The underwriting record of
the Standard helps to throw light on this
subject:—-

Capital and reserves at June 30 amounted
to £289,951, which, apart from incoming
premiums, was more than ample to meet
claims equal to the aggregate losses of the
past 4$ years. Another way of gauging the
strength of an insurance office is by compar-
ing current risks, as measured by premium
income, with funds. It is generally con-
sidered desirable that a co. should have
resources equal to 150 p.c. of its premium
income. The Standard’s funds represent
203 p.c. of last year’s record net premiums—
a very strong proportion, and much better
than most old-established English cos. can
show. But large funds do not necessarily
mean the best of protection to the policy-
holder ; a great deal depends on the dis-
position of the funds and the readiness with
which the investments can be turned into
cash. In this respect the Standard’s posi-
tion is nowadays satisfactory—much more
satisfactory than it was only five years ago:
1914. 1919.
Mortgages . . £115,965 48.4 p.c. £94,610 29.9 p.c.
Debentures.. 58,719 24.6 ~ 49,035 15.5 ~

£239,524 100.0 p.c. £316,719 100.0 p.c.
The debentures are practically all Govern-
ment and municipal securities; so since
December, 1914, while the holding of mort-
gages has been reduced by £21,355, the
Standard has acquired over £90.000 more
gilt-edged securities and increased its cash
assets by nearly £lO,OOO. Put another way,
05.7 p.c. of all assets are now in readlly-
eonvertible lines.
Like most locally-owned insurance cps.,
this one has grown very rapidly during
re.cent years. Net premium income has more
than doubled since 1909. In other words,
in 10 years the co. has leaped further than
it had crawled in the previous 30. The
Standard got through the war very well.
The U-boats knocked practically all the
profit out of the 1910 business; but since
then it has been all smooth going,
and the past year’s loss rate was smaller
than for any other term showa in the table
—due, no doubt, to Wilhelm’s sudden dis-
appearance from the high seas. Naturally
with increased taxation and heavier charges
the expense rate has climbed. Taxes, licenses
and contributions to fire brigades last year
called for £12,214, compared with £4450
five years ago. Deducting these amounts,
the cost of handling business has moved
from 31.1 p.c. of net premium income in
1914 to 32.7 p.c. last year.

In addition to the reserves shown above
there is £31,727 in “reserves for patents,
depreciation and insurance,” but no idea
can be gathered as to how much, if any, of
this can be regarded as true reserves. Nor
does the little £1450 represent the surplus
of tangible assets over and above paid
capital, for of the £140,000 of shareholders’
scrip no less than £90,000 has gone for
patent rights. The rights may prove to be
worth all that to the co. if everything works
out well; but so far they have not shown
much profit-earning capacity. _ The war and
the Government control of wireless, of
course, temporarily robbed the co. of any
opportunity it might have had of demon-
strating the value of its patent rights; but
some of the troubles have now been swept
away, and the management will have its
chance. For the investor who is looking
for security for his money, this is the best
Amalgamated Wireless can offer in the way
of tangible assets : .
Plant, stock, etc. .. .. £86,553
Book debts and cash .. .. 23,395
Government securities .. .. 10,388
£120,336
Less Liabilities .. .. • 33,658
Net tangible assets .. .. £86,678
To represent each £1 of paid capital there
is thus 12s. 4d. of tangible assets and 12s.
lOd. represented by patents. Hotvever, there
is an amount to 4s. 6d. per share set
aside to cover depreciation of all assets, but
how this amount should be apportioned The
Bulletin cannot say. And in the last re-
sort probably a good deal of the 12s. 4d. is
worth as much or as little as the 12s. lOd.
At any rate, if the goodwill is worth
nothing, neither is a quantity of the plant.
The shut-down on private radiograms dur-
ing the war deprived the co. of one of its
principal sources of revenue; but though this
field is now open again, coastal shipping has
not yet got back to normal. Better results
are, however, already showing up. Though
it is from wireless that the co. hopes to
make its rise, it is not depending wholly on
radio work for its living. During the war
years the manufacturing side of the business
was extended, and now in “one of the best-
equipped private electrical works in the
Commonwealth” the co. is turning out all
sorts of apparatus. Also the directors see
possibilities of developing a relay auto-
matic-telephone system, which it
holds the Australasian rights. The con-
cern is fortunate in having as its
managing director E. T. Fisk, who has done
much excellent work in pioneering wireless
locally. The co. is at present negoti-
ating with the Commonwealth Government
for a license to put up stations to establish
complete commercial services with the
other end of the earth, at, for a start, two-
thirds of present cable rates. _ The proposal
is meeting with some opposition, appai exit l.\
chieflv from the Navy Board. Seeing that
the co. is not seeking a monopoly—anyhow,
the public is protected against a monopoly
by the Wireless Telegraph Act—there seems
no cogent reason why it should not be gi\ en
a license. If permission is refused, it will
be up to the Federal Government to explain
what it proposes to do; for something will
have to be done to modernise long-distance
communications. Certainly the development
of commercial wireless should not be left.in
the hands of the brassliats of the Hush De-
partment. If Amalgamated Wireless does
get its license, there should be good pros-
pects ahead of the co. But further capital
will have to be raised; even should it n °t
succeed in its application . probably a fur-
ther issue will be required to meet the
recent expansion of the business. At June
30 the management was leaning on the bank
for £13,505, and owed £20,150 besides.

The Millaquin was one of the lame horses
which were turned into the Q. N. Bank s pad-
dock after the great tumble; and DA.
general-manager Ralston .nursed it and
trained it back to good condition, until W
became one of the successes that helped tne
bank to rid itself of its old troubles. How-
ever, sugar-growing and refining are not a
bank’s proper job, so nine years ago the Mu-
laquin was floated off on its own account.
But the bank and the sugar co. are still
closely connected: g.-m. Italston is the co. s
managing director, and two Q.N. directors
have seats on the Board. The Millaquin
re-started life with a paid capital of half a
million, but early in its career it went into
debt to acquire, for £75.000, further plan-
tation interests held by the Bank of N. b.
Wales. Notwithstanding this purchase the
co. was soon able to pile up liquid assets,
and during the seven years since the first
accounts were presented this progress has
been made: —
1912. 1919. .
Liabilities .. ..£111,660 £56,271
Fixed assets .. .. 493,198 469,792
Stocks . . . . 123,255 116,645
Book debts .. . . 38,600 58,268
Cash and investments 47,735
Thus the surplus of more or less liquid
assets over liabilities has expanded from
£50,195 at June. 1912, to £166,377 at the
latest balance. There was, however, £50,000
in a depreciation and renewals fund at June
30, but how much, if any, of this is likely to
be called for cannot be ascertained from the
accounts. Anyhow, since wear and tear and
minor replacements are apparently charged
against current revenue, the £60,000 now
standing to the credit of the fund, has been
regarded as a true reserve in the first table.
Despite the C. S. R. Co.’s continual wail to
the effect that it regrets that it has a penny
invested in Queensland sugar, Millaquin
goes on giving its shareholders a reasonable
return on their capital. There is nothing
fat about an average S p.c. from growing
and milling cane and refining the products;
but the picture is not so black as the C.S.R.
paints it. If anybody is in serious trouble
it is the grower, who is squeezed on one
side by labor and erratic seasons and on
the other side is at the mercy of mills and
a controlled market-price. Certainly the in-
dustry has been experiencing no end of
trouble during the past few years, and the
outlook is doubtful; but the report of the
Interstate Commission will be before the
Federal Parliament shortly, and should
throw light on many matters which are at
present obscure.

N. S. Wales Mines Minister Fitzpatrick
has never ceased to blow the trumpet because
he passed an Act ostensibly to throw open to
the miner, or the mining speculator, all pri-
vate lands; but after eiglit months there
are very few instances of any beneficial
results. Where anything important is in-
volved it is a strange, inexplicable fact that
the Mines Department has shown a marked
disinclination to expedite, or even to sanc-
tion, the enforcement of the law. In par-
ticular, in connection with applications for
leases of valuable coal lands, various devices
under red-tape regulations are being made use
of to defer dealing with them,. It is no
secret that the owners of unworked coal
lands have combined to prevent, if possible,
any interference with their possessions. No
expense is spared in fighting would-be in-
truders at every point, and the administra-
tors of the law have only themselves to
blame if their tardiness gives the “man on
the street” an opportunity to make sinister
suggestions which probably are wholly un-
founded.

Old Wallaroo and Moonta kept going much
as usual for nearly three months after the
contract with the British Munitions Dept,
expired on December 31 last. By that time
the co.’s overdraft had been piled so high and
the prospects of being able to reach
a market willing to offer a profitable
price for accumulated stocks and future pro-
duction were so indefinite that the old con-
cern followed other producers and shut down.
During the last two months of the term prac-
tically the only work done in the mines was
confined to draining and repairing the work-
ings, with a little shaft-sinking, though the
spell-oh lias given g.-m. Lipson Hancock an
opportunity to effect many “urgent repairs”
to an overworked plant which had, in four
years, poured over £@oo,ooo into the co.’s
coffers. As a result of all the troubles the
directors say that “the loss for the six months
was £53,265.” But during the period the
Federal Treasurer put in a bill for £29,083 on
account of 1916-17 War-profits Tax, and this
has been debited to the past term’s F. and L.,
On the other hand, £2322 came into the re-
serve fund from investment earnings. Hence
the net loss for the half of £21,860 shown in
the table. Still these .figures are at best
merely a guess at an approximate result, for
accounting purposes ; for even at the begin-
ning of this month the management did not
know for certain what the pink metal it had
turned out six months previously would
actually realise. The whole of the output
was passed over to the Copper Producers’
Association, whose job it has been to try to
find a market. So Wallaroo and Moonta has
had to abandon temporarily its old practice of
disclosing the average price it has received
for its product. The book loss depends, too,
entirely on the valuation at which stocks
have been taken credit for, and no informa-
tion is forthcoming on that point.
Nor have the directors attempted to give
their usual statement of costs per ton copper.
If the maintenance charges since the smelters
cooled off were tacked on to the cost per
ton of the term’s metal production and set
alongside market prices, it would make a
pitiful record. Probably for each ton copper
despatched for sale the co. has spent well
over £l2O during the six months. However,
after having in four years paid divs. equal
to p.e. and meantime laid by £200,000
of reserves, the concern could stand up
against a tap or two. With copper at any-
thing like pre-war prices the old show would
have no chance in the future unless costs
were entirely remodelled; during recent
years it has been handling lower-grade ores
with costs, f.o.b. steamer, averaging £95 com-
pared with a pre-war average of about £so.
The past half’s little output and its values
have compared wifh previous years as fol-
lows -

Not unlikely the improved value in the Wal-
laroo mines has been due partly to the man-
agement going after better-grade ore in an
effort to make office troubles easier; just
as poorer stuff was hauled up when market
prices brought it into payable scope. How
values of recent output have compared with
reserves cannot be ascertained, for on the
subject of reserves nobody seems anxious
to 'break the silence.
However, the chase after pay stuff pro-
ceeds. Six months ago g.-m. Hancock

four levels below to 2910 ft.; now he whispers
tnat this average-quality” lode material is
really to 4 p.c. stuff. His latest move is to
make for the unexplored ground east from
the °ld Elder shaft, which has not been
\\ oiked tor, many years and has been under-
going extensive repairs in preparation for
new exploratory work. Meantime the older
Moonta mines are becoming more lame —“the
grade of ore in most of the workings,” says
Hancock, “has deteriorated, and as stoping
lias necessarily become limited it may not
be practicable in resuming operations to do
much ore-raising until further payable vein-
.stuff’ has been disclosed.”
The inability to sell the copper resulted
in stocks being built up from £81,510 at

finance production and the accumulations
swallowed the co.’s cash and hit up a bank
overdraft; £40,000 dropped out of the heap
ot S. Aus. Treasury deposits, £7822 of

have slipped back about £45.000. while an

Briefly the present position of the new
finds on Hampton Plains (W.A.) is this.
Hansen and Ireland’s Celebration lease on
Block 50, now held under option for £25,000
by a syndicate of Kalgoorlie mine-managers,
has been prospected to 100 ft. Fifty feet
down a soft oxidised lode 25ft. wide bulking
2oz. was exposed, and at the bottom of the
shaft there are £5-per-ton values. Driving
and crosscutting has now commenced. On
the surface, costeens, holes and outcrops
have proved the lode for a distance of 1400 ft
f if * l inile away > 0,1 a show optioned to an
Adelaide crowd (said to represent the Per-
natty Co.), one O’Donnell has sunk a pot-
hole a few feet and struck good values. Six
miles further on other finds have been made
on Block 48 by two or three different parties,
and on one claim, held by Slavin and Ivors
two shafts are down lift, and 16ft. on sul-
phide ore claimed to assay over an ounce.
Between Blocks 50 and 48 many claims have
been staked; many peggers are ignoring the
Hampton Co.’s right to reserve alternate
blocks on the line of lode, and unless this
right is waived lots of people will find
themselves without holdings when Purveys
are completed. Much over-pegging has been
done and it will take an old-school warden
to decide the crop of disputes that are
already in the air.
Prospective mine-buyers and others are
arriving by every train. Frantic offers for
options over the blocks north and south of
the Celebration have been cabled to Lon-
don, where the Hampton Co* is domiciled,
and it is understood that the directors have
given some Perth speculators the rights over
the south block, retaining a substantial in-
terest for itself. Happenings on Block 50
quite overshadow those on 48. One feature
of the new finds is that they are in a direct
line south with the Boulder line of country,
and another is that the ore being opened up
is Claimed to be very similar to that got in
the big Ivalgoorlie workings.
An Adelaide eo., which was formed to
work a lease in the Bullfinch region, was so
ashamed of its designation that it changed it
to “Hansel Mundy” on securing a lease at
Bendigo, known by that curiosity of a name
The Hansel Mundy lease is on the West
Carshalton line at Golden Gully. This is
unquestionably the poorest sideline on the
whole field, and not one of the dozens of cos
whtoh worked on it paid a div. How a
party of Adelaide speculators ever came to
alight on such an uninviting area is a mys-
tery. Extensive prospecting works disclosed
a rank duffer, and until a few days ago
shares in the co. could have been "bought
at about 3d., representing the cash in hand,
lhe shares have since been boomed to 5s
(they now stand at about 35.) as the result
of the acquisition of an option over an un-
tried block on Hampton Plains (W.A.).

Lake Y r iew and Oroya is capitalising part
of its reserve fund and issuing one new
paid share for every seven now held. The
co.’-s assets are estimated to be wmrth well
over a million, and include a 100.000 hold-
ing in Burma Corporation, 5000 in the Bald-
win syndicate an 4 20,940 prefs. and 51,100
ords. in the Zinc Corporation. It also has
a pile of rubbish in its safe, but with the
talent on the Board shareholders are looking
forward to all this being turned to account.
Ihe flu hit Kalgoorlie badly, and for a
while almost paralysed operations on the
Bolden Mile. All the big mines have been
working short-handed, and managements are
now apprehensive that things will go from
bad to worse as a result of the exodus that
is taking place to Hampton Plains. Machine
men are very scarce.
Queen of the Hills (W.A.) has been for-
feited. The. Queen overlooks the Fenian
and other mines on the Paddy’s Flat line
of reef at Meekatharra. Lake View and
Oroya worked it for some years, and there
was much talk about its prospects. The
deposit, however, was a freak, and share-
holders got nothing.

The Federal Treasurer has refused to
allow a Ballarat scrip-incubator to be put
in commission. The White Crystal crowd,
not satisfied with the pile of shares which
they have . had to unload on to the public
in connection with their main mine at Ard-
lethan (N.S.W.), are now desirous of hatch-
ing another pile of scrip for a separate co.
to. w r ork the Stackpool lease. It is no-
thing more nor less than a typical Ballarat
scheme for a scrip-gamble, For practical
reasons, quite apart from those which prompt
the .Treasurer s refusal to sanction the for-
mation of another co., there is no necessity
for it. The two properties can be worked
under one management, with one plant, with
one set of directors, and the White Crystal
Co., as constituted, can or ought to provide
the requisite, wherewithal. It is a question
whether undisguised scrip-mongering or the
application of commonsense practical econo-
mies should prevail.

Recently-formed Associated, Emmaville
(N.5.W.),. lias promptly added another
string to its bow by acquiring an option
°/er the' Wycliffe, near Bourke’s Hill. A
co-operative party in less than six months’
actual work, with a small plant running one
shift, treated 5795 yards, of an average of
10.4 1 1 b., tor 27 tons tin oxide worth £4909.
A previous party with a horse puddler won
10 tons tin from a small area. An acre and
a half has returned over £O5OO. It is re-
ported that all-over sampling of 63 acres
showed about 3Mb. per yard. With the ex-
cision of about 10 acres of this area, and
the inclusion of a new area, an actual re-
covery of 41b. per yard is anticipated. The
present plant is to be utilised pending the
of one capable of dealing with
0000 yards per month. To provide for the
purchase of this option and for the extra
equipment, Associated is issuing a block of
reserve shares. All arrangements have been
made to start production at both mines
directly there is sufficient water in the dams

Milburn Creek copper-mine (N.S.W.) was
noted in the early ’seventies as a producer of
high-grade oxidised ores, and in the late
seventies, as the ..cause of a scandal resulting
iii a Minister being “sacked” by Parliament
.md a piomment member being saved bv the
lesignation of John Robertson, who would
,e n< ? f-’“ proposed degradation of
an old friend. The mine was held under
mc.p. title. A Broken Hill syndicate spent a
iot of money on it under working option
some 1°. years ago, but, failing to come to
terms with the owner, gave up the option,
l lie mine remained idle until recently. It
was generally considered a big snap to get
for nothing, and when the new law abrogat-
ing the title came into force there was a
rush tor it. The successful applicants un-
water ed the mine, and there their “enter-
pnse has ended. Capitalists are now being
invited to give a bonus of about £lO in cash
tor every £1 spent by the new lessees, along
with a big wad of paid-up shares, for the
privilege of taking over a mine whose plant
consists of a whip-pole. It is quite correct,
as represented, that there is some good ore
in the mine, but much further development
is necessary to determine whether or not
there is a sufficiency of it to justify the
a concentrating and smelting
plant, without which it is hardly worth con-
sidering ihe owners would be wise to look
at the show from this viewpoint.
Vegetabie Creek (N.S.W.) continues to
natter its followers with regular weekly re-
turns which must leave a nice margin of
profit A fortnight ago the output was in-
creased from 8 tons jier week to 9 tons, and
at the same time the price of tin in Sydney
S?-n t HP ro . m nfront 4Gs. to over 495. per unit.
► till there is a .strong bear account running
against the scrip in the market, because a
tot of people reckon the increased output
cannot be maintained. All the wash will
have been taken out of the Allen shaft be-
fore many weeks.
* * * *
noWMQrM ruY 1 at 9 unc,a £ ai Lon g Tun-
nel (N.S.W.) still remain unanswered. With
development being pushed ahead under-
ground and surface work still keeping some
labor busy, call .notices have added to the
discomfort of shareholders. The proposed
cyanide plant has been dropped for the pre-
sent. and will not he gone on with until
the battery resumes crushing and some cash
is got in that way. Good stone has been
sighted in the bottom workings, and, if calls
are responded to, when the drought lifts the
stamps will begin crushing without a bank
overdraft to make a hole in the gold taken
from the plates.

“Jackar”: The inherent weakness of E. C.
Dyason’s Bendigo Amalgamated is revealed in
its present position. The Constellation mine,
which is now showing such excellent results,
is not aptly named; it is a bright, particular
star, but it forms no part of a “constella-
tion” ; there is no star of equal brilliance
either north or south. The formation which
is yielding so well cannot last long; there
is no suggestion that it may be expected to
be of equal richness in the adjoining mines;
the fact may be that it has been prospected
in them and has shown no gold enrichment.
But the crucial point is that this extra-
willing horse has to try to make up for the
many laggards in a big team. If there were
assurance that this mine could provide years
of work on rich stone such as is now being
won, there would still be no guarantee that
its profits would counterbalance the losses on
other mines. Under the old system the Con-
stellation would have a fortnightly dividend
distributed among hundreds of enthusiasts
who would launch out in prospecting enter-
prises in all directions—haphazard they
would be, certainly; but has not the history
of the field been that its success has been
mostly in purely chance developments?
Dyason’s great hope is that history may re-
peat itself in another respect: that the good
discovery, on one line will be followed by
equally rich discoveries on other lines. This
is what occurred in 1870-71, when the field
was in the same almost hopeless position as
it is now.

Now that George Bryant has hooked on
to the Duke Extended, Maryborough (Vic.),
clouds are lifting once more. He turns up
when £lOO.OOO has been spent on this
ancient among the nlluvials. Of that
£57,000 came from gold won, and £37 000
from calls. Bryant was bred among the old
Duke mines, and his summing up of the
perilous state of the Duke Extended is that
pluck should not disappear because a 700 ft
patch of lead carries no gold on a hard
cemented bottom. So he is belting up the
gutter to the west and shoving down the
lead to the. east. So far he has not alighted
on much in the western end, but in the
deep ground east, he has already run into
lodwt. dirt carrying* a good sample of gold.
As there is 3700 ft. to go up the /lead'
perore the old workings are reached, there
is plenty of room for lots of things to
happen. The ground is easy working stuff,
and therefore, even if a new minors’ log
shows up, costs can be kept low. which
can t be said for the Ararat mines.

Mining is being resumed again at North
Mt. . Farrell (Tas.). Repairs and ex-
tensive development have been carried out
during the forced, stoppage, and arrange-
ments made for quick and economic handling

containing a good run of firsts, while the

mates of ore in sight on their holding. Tom
Jones, for the syndicate, reported 160,000,000
tons of high-grade ore, followed later by
Speck Govt. Geologist Reid, who, evidently
not unmindful of the paring his chief’s
figures of Blythe tonnage received under
Commonwealth investigation, reports
20,500,000 tons of 68 p.c. ore as positive,
with strong evidence of further millions of
tons of possible ore.
* * * *
Recent developments at the Boulder-
Dreadnought (Tas.), where a pipe of ore
12ft. wide has assayed 2 p.c. tin for 30ft.
of winzing, may make this erratic deposit
a producer again. The main trouble with
this _ field is its fine tin (making concen-
tration difficult), erratic ore lenses and
poverty of ore.

Consulting-engineer Lewis and staff are
back on Federation tin (Tas.) re-checking
and re-estimating ore in sight and grade
before the big co. goes ahead with its equip-
ment.

•She was not listed on your noisy quays,
O little port of Earth;
No screaming crane, no whining derrick’s wheeze
Betrayed her secret berth,
Ere down the tide-way swift and white she slipped,
While every flag on one gay harbor dipped.
Perhaps old Pinchgut spoke her in his sleep,
And South Head’s sleepless eye
Gave her Godspeed ere heaved the trackless deep
To meet uncharted sky,
And brooding Darkness built her cloudy cairn
O’er Earth’s poor little coast-lights, dropped astern.
Perhaps a wheeling gannet, outward blown,
Or the swift albatross
Sighted her dropping down the dark, alone,
Where spectral wind-weeds toss,
And screaming turned him from the empty main
To harbor lights and kind home cliffs again.
For her nor sunken rock nor hidden shoal,
But that mysterious sea
Lip-lapping in the hollow of the bowl
God holds upon His knee,
While through His fingers sand of aeons runs
In constellated whirl of ordered suns.
For it was written in the Book of Years
Ere Earth’s first rib was laid,
He that has kept the Faith among his peers,
And perished unafraid,
Shall have his place in that high company
Of gods that are when half-gods cease to be.
And such shall have safe convoy till he stand,
Free from the fettering, clod,
With that great brotherhood on either hand,
That walks and talks with God,
In loyal faith and . goodly fellowship,
And simple singleness of eye and lip.
And sees revealed what human eyes behold
Darkly as in a glass,
When Eleusinian curtains backward fold
And the pale pageants pass....
Life’s aimless martyrdom of blood and tears
In slow procession darkling down the years.
Of such was he who saw in broken gleams
The Vision Beautiful,
Nor shrank dismayed because his waking dreams
Transgressed the common rule;
Who dared be free to dare the “grand mistake,”
Or play the fool for nobler folly’s sake.
Of such was he, our brother who has gone
Beyond our little grief;
Beyond the shadow of that Acheron
Of pestilent belief;
Who kept the Faith and flung Her standard free
To the young winds of all futurity.
She was not listed on your noisy quays,
0 little port of Earth;
No screaming crane, no whining derrick’s wheeze
Betrayed her secret berth,
Ere down the tide-way swdft and white she slipped,
While every flag on one gay harbor dipped.

, From the Federal Gallery:—
I Hughes’s oratory has not been improved by his
hard practice in Britain. His Peace speech in the
Peps, was damaged by his brain’s inability to re-
call the charms of an earlier vocabulary for the
service of the occasion. Now and again came a
phrase that was hot with inspiration, but for the
most part the little man hunted desperately among
the verbs and adjectives, and often carried on the
search while Hansard waited. For over two hours
the reporters steadily recorded the welter of de-
capitated metaphors, murdered similes, and young
and tender substantives bereaved of their predi-
cates, and Heaven only knows what purgatories they
suffered in hammering the stuff into shape for
publication. Hughes is bad for Pitman at any
time now, but, fatigued by his subject, he was on
this occasion a trial to the shorthand brigade. If
he ever prays, he ought to ask a blessing on the
Fourth Estate, whose ingenuity and intelligence
made him an orator to thousands of readers. His
bedraggled English, that has never yet reached the
richness of Watt’s, was beautifully starched and
ironed for the comfortable citizen who gulps down
his politics with a breakfast egg.
When James Macintosh, for many years
one of Dalgety’s managers in Bananaland and
Maoriland, died last week, there was a big-
hearted man less in the world. Going to
Dalgety’s 25 years ago, Macintosh became
manager at Townsville and then transferred
to Brisbane, Christchurch and Wellington.
Subsequently he joined W. and G. Turnbull
and Co. in the windy city. The end was
a sad one. There had been recurrence of
a painful affection, a trip to Sydney for
a surgical operation and then a voyage back
across the Tasman a day or two before the
finish. The dead man was a brother of
Alec Macintosh, once auditor for the Bank
of Aew Zealand, and later superintendent
for Dalgety and Co. Another brother, Hugh,
is in the Bananaland Survey Department.
Jim came next to Alec. He was about 70.
Dead at 70 or thereabouts, Henry Clay
Callahan, the Yankee mine-manager who
bossed and boemed the Lake View Consols in
the. early days of Ivalgoorlie. After making
a pile in the West he settled down as a land-
owner in ’Frisco.
Tom Poole was made K.C. in Adelaide last
week, and the local dailies regard him as
a certainty for the new Fourth Judgeship.
Presumably there has been consistent refusal
by his seniors of a post worth only £l7OO
a year. Still, Poole is a sound lawyer. Son
of a veteran Anglican canon, he took law
at Melbourne Uni.; but he has always prac-
tised in Adelaide, first as a junior with
Symon, and for the last ten years as head
of the firm of Poole and Johnstone.
Captain F. P. Blackmore, who died at
Box Hill (Vic.) the other day, aged 82,
enjoyed a local fame of his own, in addition
to that which came to him through being
brother to the author of “Lorna Doone.”
He had held many posts in the British Army,
helped to annex Fiji, and for many years was
prominent in the island’s affairs. He settled
at Box Hill 14 years ago, and right up to
the end took a keen interest in sport, and
was able to perform slick work with an
artist’s brush. During the war he designed
several effective recruiting posters.
The seemingly interminable Snow case has
been before the Courts again—the Full Court
in Adelaide this time, Justice Isaacs pre-
siding. The charge, as of old, is “having
attempted to trade with the enemy.” This
time Snow, a very sick man, who will never
trade with the enemy again or with friends
either, intimated that he was thoroughly
tired. “Come on, have done with it,” he
said in effect in a long statement to the
Court. “If I was wrong it was an error
of judgment, though I did not either trade
or attempt to trad|j jwitlx the enemy.

Private M. Sutherland, of the 4th Field Am-
bulance, recently got his discharge at 62. He
crowded through with the big rush of recruits
early in 1915. There have been older Dig-
gers, but most of them cracked up before
they reached the line. Sutherland kept going
for 24 years till Fritz sniped him in No
Man’s Land when carrying out a wounded
Aussie. There was a son in France to keep
him company.
Lieut. Henry Baker, D. 5.0., who before

Moralisings by the Hawkesbury:—
In a bunch my neighbors, Robert Smith (86),
William Saunders (84), Granny Clark (96) and
Thomas ?rown (72), have migrated over the Great
Divide. Poor Tom always was sickly, which accounts
for his premature decease. From his home on the
Catti he had a water funeral to the oldest Aus-
tralian church, at Ebenezer on the river, a hearse-
boat w-ith mourning-boats. The memory of these
old-timers divided Australian history into two

“To be, or not to be; that is the question.
Whether it is better to have an election

the other side.”
periods: before and after the discovery of gold. Be-
fore, the earnings of a man and bullock-waggon were
a shilling a day. It took Saunders three months’
wages to buy a new hat. The now open land from
Parramatta to Windsor, cleared for wheat-growing,
gave chequered results till rust administered the
k.o. Sheep, this side of the Mountains, failed fropr
foot rot. On their grants settlers grew their own
grain, usually maize, taking it to the mill and
waiting till it was ground. Meat came from the
harness-cask, filled by a beast sometimes the pro-
perty of the owner. Every house had a jar of
rum. To live within the law one had to work
very hard indeed; hours, four o’clock in the morn-
ing till sundown. Saunders lately remarked with
satisfaction how rapidly the children and grand-
children of disreputable ancestors had under better
conditions developed into good neighbors and
workers. After the ’fifties and the gold discovery,
any kind of labor was worth a pound a day;
the strenuous struggle for bare existence ceased,
and corn-fed Hawkesbury men—it was hard to find
one under six feet—spread over the continent to
stamp the new Australian race with their charac-
teristics. Thus the cradle of the Aussie’s resource-
fulness, energy and self-reliance was rocked in
those now-forgotten years of fierce struggle in the
valley of the Old River.
The death of Sam McCaughey, who was
to have paid the bills, interrupted the pre-
parations of Lieuts. McGinness and Fysh
for competing in the England-to-Australia
flight. Instead of the long trip, these two
D.S.C.’s have now taken on the'job of sur-
veying the trans-Australian route to be tra-
velled by the Handley-Page machine from
England to Melbourne. No ’planes come
into these preliminaries, however, the pair
starting off .on four wheels from Longreach

W. C. Thomson, of the A.U.S.N. Co., leaves

rather unusual record of having voyaged into
matrimony four times.
Another oculist chips in:—
With reference to the late Sam McCaughey and
his operation for cataract (B. 18/9/’l9), it is hardly
likely that Colonel Smith’s enthusiasm for his own
method, extraordinary though it undoubtedly is,
would have led him to contemplate the intraeap-
sular method of extraction with an octogenarian
patient. It is dangerous in the most practised
hands, and is being gradually placed on the scrap-
heap even by Indian operators. There is too much
danger of subsequent blindness resulting from the
force necessary to detach the diseased lens from
its surroundings. It is most likely that Smith per-
formed the usual operation, which consists in opening
the capsule first, and then expressing the diseased
lens. The capsule in this case remains behind, and
is usually needled at a subsequent operation. Most
writers on the subject say that the intracapsular
operation should be reserved for those patients who
have an eye to spare. And it is surprising how
few patients think they have.
Queensland is still the place where the
white man wilts—especially if he’s a woman.

McCoy, the Speck’s Director of Educa-

Aus., has done excellent work under three
Ministries, establishing high schools, junior
technical classes and a dental clinic in con-
nection with nearly every primary school in
the State. But his term of office has been
a picflie compared with that of his chief
predecessor, Neale, of South Aus., whose
job was to clean up the disgraceful mess into
which the Education Department had fallen
under successive Governments unsympathetic
to free and compulsory State education.
Neale found the schools ill-lighted, ill-venti-
lated and insanitary, and staffed by incom-
petents. be truly said that scores
of men and women had qualified for teach-
ing by failing at every other business.
Children of 12 and 13 were unable to tell
the time by a clock; and it was officially
estimated that at least 50 per cent, of the
pupils were medically, and therefore educa-
tionally, below par. Neale pitilessly exposed
the rottenness of the Department. Private
and ” denominational interests made common
cause against the “South Australian inter-
loper,” and it was not long before his down-
right and not over-tactful methods gave his

It is not often that a man goes to such
trouble to publicly deny an accusation of
sobriety as a Perth citizen did recently. He
confessed to “going gay” one night at a

hanging in the bedroom where he had been
deposited to “sleep it off.” He charged the
licensee with the responsibility for his loss
in that his door was unprovided with a key,
the light was left burning, and his possession
of notes to the valne of £7O was known t<•
the landlord and others. The licensee gave
his lodger a reputation that the latter might
have valued highly—on a different occasion.
He swore that his client’s conversation was

startling novelty to a certain natural func-

astounded victim out of his wits, and if the
victim happens to be a lady, as has several
times been the case, the easiest way of com-

“Veri”; The 6th Field Ambulance at
Querriau had a busy time during the anxious
days of 1918, when Jerry was trying for
Amiens. Being the only hospital within a
large radius, it had not only to act as a
clearing station for
the casualties from
the line, but to dis-
pense for those who
paraded sick from
surrounding units,
which included a
Tommy labor

tuhee, London, are strong on Empire
geography. Here is my most cherished travel
souvenir—an order given to some officers
who travelled out on the same steamer:—
To the Senior Officer at the Port of Disembarkation,
New Zealand.
Please provide the Passengers on the attached list
who are proceeding to New Zealand on Steamship
Beltana, sailing on or about 2.6.’19, with first-class
rail accommodation to Suva, Fiji Islands, and if the
journey extends overnight with a lower berth or
appropriate sleeping accommodation.

“HarrisonO.” : The “unwritten law” (which
is not a law, but a sentimental nebulosity
employed to appease mob-clamor or save a
wealthy criminal) has not been imported to
Australia, but some remarks made the other
day by Melbourne Coroner Cole suggest that
it may arrive at any moment, and be given
too hearty a welcome in some quarters. A
Melbourne citizen burst into a room to which
his wife had retired with a man, and in
the struggle a revolver belonging to the
husband went off, killing the philanderer.
At the inquest, after the husband had been
arrested for murder, the Coroner (who
eventually returned a finding of “misadven-
ture”) delivered himself thus.: “If a man
find any man in an act of adultery with his
wife, and in a transport of passion he kill
the man, the law looks upon it as man-
slaughter of the mildest character.” Coroner
Cole is notoriously shaky in law; so hus-
bands with sound or baseless suspicions
would do well not to go nap on his dictum.
The taking of one citizen’s life by another,
even when the victim has been guilty of
something .really damnable (and adultery is
not a serious offence legally, seeing that a
person cannot even be sentenced to impri-
sonment till the rising of the Court for com-
mitting it), is something that the law does
not (and should not) regard lightly. Were
it encouraged plain anarchy would super-
vene. The anger, characteristic of a cer-
tain type of mind, so often manifested to-
ward gentlemen who have been giddy with
someone else’s spouse, arises less from
morality than a conviction that lovely woman
is the chattel of her lord and master, so
that the person who goes astray in her com-
pany outrages the sacredness of propputy.
REPORTING PROGRESS.
“Get any orders from old Gruff son?”
“Yes, two.”
“Good! What were they?
“Get out and stop out.”
From winking at the shooting of a man
who steals (or accepts) his neighbor’s wife,
it is only a few -steps to approving the mur
dGr oi him who steals another’s ox, ass pet
barmaid or favorite fishing-rod.

BEFORE the GRADUOLA, the in-
genious patented tone controlling de-
vice in the AEOLIAN VOCALION
was invented, it was hitherto unknown
how to mechanically imitate the voice
perfectly.
The GRADUOLA achieves the seem-
ingly impossible. Like a singer’s throat,
it perfectly controls tone
m
rim
i©sE —*
Similar to the vocal chords the GRADUOLA
is elastic in nature and of great flexibility. Like
the throat it expands and contracts and can di-
minish or increase a tone slowly or rapidly and
by imperceptible degrees. The
AEOLIAN
YOCALION
is the only phonograph that can accomplish this.
Even if the VOGALION did not possess
other outstanding features, this one overwhelming
attribute alone, namely, the GRADUOLA, would
be sufficient to make your choice a VOGALION.^

As to the value of the Senior Cadet train-
mg as part of the Australian Defence
s > stem, Cygnus” writes: —
On Saturday our company fell in at Centennial
1 arlc. After much unnecessary talk and delay we
were marched down to the Area Office, where there
a first in first out” rush at the gun cases. The
lever and firing mechanism of the rifles had been
removed, so we had to drill with lumps of steel
and wood. No boy can whip up an interest in a
rifle that has been dismembered. When we arrived
at the park again more than half an hour had gone
A few incompetent lads were selected for musketry
drill. Various sections were marched about till
they got “settled down.” Then an aeroplane came over
and everybody found it much more interesting than
drill. Next the roll was called at each section
of four cadets, instead of getting the platoon together
and doing it once only. Roll call and stamping our
cards took 20 minutes, after which the parade was
dismissed. As I have been wearing my own boots at
drill for over 18 months I tried to ask one of the
officers (there were four present) about getting a
pair; but they were too busy talking to one another
to bother. As an example of slipshod drill the
Order to march was frequently given to platoons
standing at ease without the lads being drawn to
attention first. Once in motion there was no
attempt made to make us keep in step or in line.
On every side I saw that the officers were disobeyed
flagrantly, and that they had practically no control.
The lads are thus being trained in indiscipline, not
discipline.
* * * *
“Rio”: Those who can’t se e the use of
Duntroon, and think that indeed it may be
harmful because it produces “a military
caste,” happen to differ from Napoleon, who
was a college-trained officer; also from Foch,
Monash, Roberts, Wellington. Yon Moltke,'
Grant and the other notable soldiers of history,
all of them great students. Monash, though
a citizen soldier, has always been a deep stu-
dent of military history, and is a gold medal-
list in the subject. When you hear that the
Duntroon curriculum was worth nothing on
Gallipoli you hear nonsense. To say that four
years’ study of military subjects and of
ground in its relation to tactics is of no use
just because one is in a strange country is
as sensible as it would be to insist that a
doctor’s medical course is of no value when
he mfeets a new disease. If it were so the
men who have distinguished themselves in
this war win be of no particular use in the
next if it happens to be fought elsewhere.
Digger, a recent contributor, said that offi-
cers who knew nothing of mathematics and
no language but their own made excellent
leaders m this last war. Perhaps they did,
but very tew of them, and only in infantry
and Light Horse. No officer without a know-
ledge ot mathematics could make a good artil-
lery or engineer leader. The uneducated in-
-r. as only liable because
evuything but the actual leading was done
lor linn by staffs which did know something
ot mathematics and languages. The infan-
try leader was told where, when and just
how tar to attack. The artillery barrage
without which he could in most cases have
done nothing, was invented, timed and
arranged for by others. He had to worry
his head about nothing outside his own coin-
mand until he was told just where to be of
the best use again.

Kello” : I read a Yankee whoop that in
the last days of the big conflict America’s
daily _ war bill was greater than that of
Britain. I don’t doubt it; and it is no-
thing to be proud of. The waste
among the Sammies was appalling.
)'e «ad a Sammy battalion attached
to our division in the Bullecourt Tun-
nel stunt, and I was in charge of an
ordnance dump where we kept a stock
of Lewis-gun barrels for the speedv
replacement of those worn out. A
spare barrel is carried with each gun,
to permit of interchanging when the
bar u el J l n use S ets hot - I was so
rushed handing out the tubes that I
couldn t keep a close check
on the issues; but I dis-
covered that the Yank bat-
talion was calling - for more
barrels than all the rest of
the division put together. I
sought the reason from a
bammy sergeant, and was
told that when th*eir guns
got hot they took the barrel
out* threw it away, and re-
placed it with a new one.
Lewis-gun barrels cost something like
x.l a time!
Randolph Bedford’s allegations :—•
Down with German militarism! An Australian
civilian resident of New Guinea has been twice dur-
ing the last two years before the military heads of
the Australian Occupation i n Rabaul for failing
to lift his hat to a staff-officer. Of course, they
could do nothing; but the will was there, although
the power was absent. In another case an Aus-
tralian civilian passing two officers, one of them
his friend, said “Good day, Bill.” The other
officer, a panjandrum, objecting, the civilian was
carpeted and told that “Good morning, Bill,” is
against the law. It must be the Law of Averages;
I know of no other. No wonder the German laughs.
.Damn the German, anyhow! He has fastened on
Australia an imitation of his damnable military
cult. One militarism is as bad as another if it’s
allowed to become fat and saucv.
* * * *
All these strikes that upset the ordinary
course of a peaceful life —by seamen, hotel
employees, tramwaymen, railwaymen, coal-
miners (who at time of writing threaten to
send Australia to bed by candlelight), pro-
fiteers (who are striking against Australia
and putting forefinger to nose concerning
W. M. Hughes’s Rhapsodies), bakers, etc.—
remind one that there is a' misprint in the
Lords Prayer. It should read: “Give us
this day our daily dread.”
* * * *
T.G.W.”: The six Victorian prisoners
who escaped by wrenching up two flooring
boards of the prison-van and dropping out
along the road to Pentridge, imitated the
trick played by a coach-load of gold-thieves
oU years ago. They were being brought to
Melbourne under ah escort of troopers, and
like their modern imitators they sang to
drown their carpentering. The coach and
escort were proceeding at. a trot through the
dark when one of the rearguard troopers
was thrown through his horse stumbling
over something in the middle of the road,
ihe obstruction turned out to be one of
the gold-thieves. Upon recovering his wind,
he told the astonished troopers that his
mates had dropped out some time before,
and were probably 20 miles away by that
time. His reason for being so late was that
he had fallen asleep while waiting his turn
and had been carried on. A search was at
once begun, but the other birds were never
caught.

“Black Bonnet”: The new regulations re-
garding the employment of aboriginals are
arousing the utmost indignation in the Far
INorth (_Q,). They have evidently been com-
piled by men who are quite ignorant of the
conditions of life up here. Besides paying
wages out of all proportion to the value of
the black’s services, any employer must now
supply clothes, luxuries and conveniences he
rarely dreams of possessing hjmself, and
(here is the rub) from 30 to SO per cent, of
the abo.’s wage must be paid in trust to the
Government. It is supposed that the police
pay out this reserve to Binghi, when he
needs it; but ask the black! At all events,
those who have employed a gin or a boy occa-
sionally, or all the time, cannot afford to
do it under the new rates, and the con-
sequence is that much black brother is
starving. Already a great number, having
lost their employment, have gathered at
Cairns, and influenza has broken out Among
them—and you know what that means. What
accommodation and clothes and luxuries and
v ages do the poor free people of this country
get at the mission stations which the Gov-
ernment seems determined to fill V Again
ask the black!

[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Dear, do not fret your jealous heart
Because I sing; of Isabel.
Her praises need not cause you smart,
For Isabel, I grieve to tell,
Is dead; in verse I dish her up
I hat you and I, my love, may sup.
hy should you worry all your days
If other girls in verse I set?
borne day, perchance, I’ll sing your praise,
In poems breathing soft regret.
Most gladly, dearest, will I try
To sing your virtues—if you die !

"TV. Casey’: I rise to nominate grey-gum
as one of the best for maul wood. I have seen it
used by many woodcutters, and all voted it equal to
the best red-gum and very close to the best ironbark,
and better than a lot of it. It takes some trimming,
and the better that is done the better the maul. I
have seen some mauls made from grey-gum wear
nearly to the handle, and then the stuff hardly
diove. For a handle a young grey-gum sucker or
seedling will wear with the best; or get a black
wattle about 6in. through and trim your handles out
or it. They have to be very smooth near the eve

the emblem on the proposed new Australian nickel
coin , The other day I took my locomotive out on
a piece of new railway, where the noise of a train
had never before disturbed the silence of the bush.
The larm-house kids shrank back timidly. The cattle
and sheep turned tail and ran. The hens, geese and
turkeys flew off panic-stricken. Even the dogs went
ratty at the intrusion of the strange monster. Mean-
wtule a pair of kookaburras sitting close together
on the limb of an old dry gum-tree, bills straight in the
air breasts out to the fullest extent, just laughed
and kughed until the tears ran down their cheeks,
ft that lsn t the joyous Australian spirit, what is?
“Moobitta” ; A remarkable instance of
maternal solicitude occurred here in Gippsland a
few days ago. A child, strolling with trustv Towser
lor companion, stumbled on to the maternity ward
of Bier Rabbit, whose matron had gone to consult
a specialist upon the proper care of infants. Towser,
scenting the newly-closed dugout, promptly started
scratching. Encouraged by his little mistress, he
soon unearthed two of the loveliest bits of fluff
Maggie had ever seen. Proudly folding them in her
pinafore she hastened home nearly half a mile dis-
tant. There the precious little bits of fluff were
enclosed in a box. On the third day the family
were absent until evening and Towser failed to
come home. The parents having occasion to leave
the kitchen door open for a while, with the lamp
alight, were astonished upon their return to see
Mrs. Bunny, with the kittens going their hardest at
the milk-supply department. The box had been
overturned and the kittens were on the floor. Of
course Mrs. B. bolted upon discovery.

“Azac” : For maul-handle I will nominate
red-gum. It is a particularly strong timber with a
tensile strength of no less than 20,2001 b. per sq.
inch. This wood has been endorsed in Westralia by
the Commonwealth Government as a substitute
for the imported hickory axe-handle. It proved the
best of the timbers tested for that purpose. Four
thousand handles were manufactured and placed on
the market. Out of this number only 17 were
returned by buyers. Among the other timbers
tested were swamp-oak, wandoo, she-oak, gimlet and
salmon-gum. All these except she-oak proved A 1
for handles.

“Penner-up”: “A.M.1.” (B. 11/9/19)
asks what will cure his collie of rushing in and
biting the sheep. Try this. Get a piece of No 8
fencings-wire sufficiently long when it is bent in the
shape of a muzzle to protrude about four or five
inches in front of Towser’s nose. On each end of
it. make a loop so that it can be fastened to the
collar. See that it allows a bit of plav. Then at
a point just in front of the rear of the dog’s mouth
make two smaller loops. Having done this -get
another piece of straight wire, on the end of which
make a loop which will not pass through the loops
just mentioned. Fasten the contraption to the
dogs collar and pass the straight piece of wire
tin ough the loop on the main piece and through
the dogs mouth. Make another loop on the end
of that, and you have a first-class corrective. This
muzzle, if it may be called so, will allow Bruno to
have a drink at a dam. But it will give him a
nasty bump when he thinks he is about to give
the sheep a nip. Another point in its favor is
that it will not allow him to pick up anv poison
that may be lying about. ' P ° °"

"McNorth”: Touring Torres Strait in the
mission vessel the padre and 1 landed at Saibai, a
low, flat island that lies in the shoal waters of the
coast of Western Papua. As we went along the
village street towards the Residency that stood in
the shade of the cocoanuts up the beach, the
natives told us that the Gubment teacher had left
for Thursday Island some time before and that the
school was in charge of a native. We found the
temporary teacher .standing in the centre of the
palm-thatched schoolhouse, a blackboard in front
of him and SO or 40 discolored children to his left
DOUBTS.
INSURANCE DOCTOR: “I see you've had appendicitis."
APPLICANT: “Well, I was operated on, but whether it was appendicitis or professional

and right. As we entered he rapped a cane on the
blackboard and the pupils, after the fashion of the
Strait, stood up to show their respect for the two
feller big marster. Then he made the crowd sing
part-songs, action songs and songs with the flavor
of a hymn-book. Moody and Sankey sound funny
in bPche-de-rner English. The dominie put the star
pupils through their paces, and, in stilted, carefully-
phrased language, spoke proudly of the precocity of
certain pupils who, although they had been attend-
ing school for only Six years, could do simple
addition. He was absolutely sincere, and derived
great satisfaction from the fact that he had been
on the spot and able to take charge of the school
when the European teacher suddenly cleared out.
Some of the pupils were big enough and old enough
to be married and out working. There were at least
a dozen fully-developed young women who should
have had palm-thatches of their own, and the same
number of youths. But the self-appointed teacher
affectionately referred to them all as “my shildern ”
* * * *
“Hay”: I sampled some flour in Centralia
in the middle of the ’seventies that had been stored
for three or four years in an iron tank. No man
knew how many generations of weevils had lived
and died in it, but notwithstanding its ripeness it
was possible to buy it at the moderate price of a
bob a pannikinful. After sifting it through a piece
of rag to remove the largest and hairiest of the
animal contents, the bulk was reduced by one-half.
When the horrible remainder was made into johnny-
cakes, no matter how hard the outside was baked, the
inside kept to the density of soft putty.
“Melos”: “Te Whare” (B. 28/8/19) is
wrong in saying that of Australian poisonous snakes
only the black, brown, tiger and death-adder are
at all common or very widely distributed. The
deadly copperhead has a wide distribution; but
owing to its habit of appearing sometimes in s’mi-
lai attire to that of the black, brown or tiger-
snake it is often wrongly recorded. On close exam-
ination, however, the crawler is easily distinguished
fi om the other species. The subcaudals are arranged
in a single file; in the black and in the brown they
are in two rows. The body scales are directed back-
ward (as in the case of the black), thus differing
from those of the tiger, which are set obliquely and
not directly backward. The copperhead also wears
a dark coppery patch on the nape of his neck.

mother were some of the first of the South Aus. Co.
people to arrive in Australia, and they camped on
Kangaroo Island while a more permanent abode was
being fixed up on the mainland—where Adelaide is
now. They often spoke of the two white men and
their black gins who were living on the island when
they came. The men said that they had escaped
m a boat from Tasmania and decided to live per-
manently on Kangaroo. They brought the two gins
from the mainland. There were some children, so
probably those on the island now are descendants of
the two families. One of the men answered to the
name of Nat Thomas, but I forget now what the
other one called hiyiself. They hunted and fished
for a living.
Hall Marke”: We were talking about
being bushed, and several method's of ascertaining
location were put forward. One theory was that
the northern side of a tree-trunk is a lighter hue
than the southern side; but it requires a keenness
of vision above the average to detect the differ-
ence. It was also stated that the bark of trees
is thicker on the south side, but tills was scouted
by one old bush hand as being unreliable. A better
scheme seemed to me to find nortli by means of
a razor (if one be handy). The razor is opened
tied 80 tllat the handle and blade form an
“L.” The mower is then suspended in the air.
and the blade should point north. I tried this and
concluded that it would be too risky to rely on.

go back on their own tracks. I have done this

SHIFTING
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
For seven dry years we’ve had the place,
Just hangirT on an’ driftin',
But we are off to Wantigong
An’ 1 am busy shiftin’.
It took a day to load the dray
With things that’s big an’ bulky,
An’ there’s a lot of odds an’ ends
I’m packin’ on the sulky.
There is a box of pots an’ pans,
An’ there’s the bed an’ beddin’,
The chest of drawers an’ lookin’-glass
That we got at our weddin’.
They’re so patched up with nails an’ string
They’re hardly fit for shiftin’;
It took some time to bind them up,
And then they took some liftin’.
I’ve packed the dishes an’ the plates,
Just one inside the other.
An wrapped the pair of vases in
The quilt I got from mother.
The kitchen safe, the washin’-board,
The dresser an’ the table,
I put them up an’ roped them on
As well as I was able.
My husband’s at the township now.
He went to try an’ borrer
A pair of horses an’ a trap,
An’ he’ll be back to-morrer.
I almost wish he hadn’t gone,
For people don’t like lendin’,
An’ goin’ to the township means
A little bit of spendin’.
I’m rollin’ up an’ nailin’ down,
I haven’t time for thinkin’.
I’m leavin’ out just what we need
For eatin’ arT for drinkin’.
The anvil an’ the grindin’ stone—
-1 don’t know how to pack them.
An’ fencin’ tools an’ campin’ stools,
I don’t know where I’ll stack them.
ONE SCHOOL AND ANOTHER.
HIS REVERENCE: “ And how is young Denis
getting on at the school?”
O’R EGAN: "Oh. he ginerally wins a couple
o' quid by dinner-time a-Sunday!”
An’ there’s my pots of quandong jam,
An’ quandongs I’ve been dryin’ ;
Perhaps they don’t grow over there.
An’ they will save us buyin’.
An’ then there is my turkey hens,
The few that I’ve been keepin’—
The foxes got the rest of them
One night when we were sleepin’.
For years an' years we’ve struggled on,
But now' at last we’re goin’.
We Sold the place at half the cost
An’ paid up what was owin’.
The land was always dry an’ poor,
There was no good in stoppin’.
It wasn’t fit for grazin’ stock-;
It wasn’t fit for croppin’.
There was no use in strugglin’ on;
It only meant starvation.
We saw a chance of better things,
An’ sold out to the station.
We both was getting careless like,
A kinder hopeless driftin’;
We sold the place for half the cost —
And, thank God, now we’re shiftin’.

Bill Bowyang” ; “Gouger” is right about
the gelatine-like flower on the Barrier Reef which
conceals scared fish (B. 4/9/’l9). It is one of
the many varieties of anemone found in these
W'aters. There is one strange thing about this
particular anemone that “Gouger” omitted to men-
tion. The species generally grows in clumps, but
no two are of the same color. Small fish about
an. inch long, when alarmed, swim inside the
anemone with. a corresponding color. One species
of anemone which grows on the Barrier Reef is
poisonous, and trepang fishermen who have allowed
it to touch their flesh have experienced what re-
sembles an electric shock. The injured part soon
swells, and the patient feels the effects for days
afterwards. Binghi considers the anemone a delicacy
when cooked.
* * * *
“Azac”: If the water in a dam has be-
come foul by reason of live stock having access to
it, or through the washing-in of soil, or other causes,
try the following for clarifying. Obtain a box or
a number of boxes about the size of a small fruit-
case and perforate the bottoms and sides wdth Jin.
holes. Partly fill the boxes with a mixture of com-
mercial alum and sulphate of iron in eqdal parts.
Attach the box to wires or strings and pull back-
wards and forwards across the surface so that a
fair percentage of the mixture will be dissolved.
This will at once cause a precipitation of the foul
matter and leave the general body of water clean.
* * * #
“Hay”: Back in the winter of ,1870 I
met the cheapest droving outfit I ever saw. It con-
sisted of 350 head of cattle coaxed along by two
white men and one Kanaka. Each man hadia riding-
horse and a pack-horse. They had then been over
two months on their journey and had arrived at
Lake Frome (S. Aus.) from Windorah (Q.), having
travelled a distance of over 500 miles through what
was then practically virgin country. When they
called in at the farthest north-east settlement of
S. Aus. for provisions their supply of flour and
sugar was exhausted, and they had lived for several
days on pigweed and wild-geranium stalks. The
cattle were all there and in fine fettle. There was
abundance of feed of all kinds and water every-
where. It rained off and on all the winter that year
in the interior, and in many places the spear-grass
grew sft. high. After leaving Lake Frome , they met no
further difficulty in obtaining supplies, as there were
stations at intervals for the rest of the journey to
Adelaide. Nine hundred miles of the trip was
straight through unfenced country.
* * * »
“Moe”: Along the northern coast of New
Guinea the Spaniard has left plenty traces of his
early visits. A few miles from Morobe, which is
about 30 miles up the coast from the boundary be-
tween Papua and the late German territory, is a
large flat rock on which are carved pictures of un-
mistakably Spanish origin. There is apparently no
connected story in the carvings. For the most part
they are just crude representations of a ship possess-
ing the old high poop, men with long swords and
visored hats, and niggers throwing spears. The local
native has- not the slightest idea of how they got
there. Further up the coast, at Madang, which in
the old days used to be Friedrich-Wilhelmshaven, are
several more of the carvings; while over opposite

to the town on Vulkan Island are the bones of a
ship which at the very least 'must be 200 years
old. Just close to the wreck is a seaweed-inerusted
camion lying in about 60ft. of water. Members of
the Australian garrison at Madang tried their best
in 1917 to raise this piece, but the niggter divers
were of poor quality, and no amount of promised
tobacco or threats were successful in inducing them
to get down far enough to put a rope around the
relic.
T. 0.1. : Apropos horse endurance. In the
early days of Port Phillip the settlement had a
turfite, John Ewart, known as “Hopping Jack,” from
the fact that he had one faulty leg. He was the
owner of an eel-backed bay horse which carried him
overland from Sydney to Melbourne, 600 miles in
10 days. ’
THE POETRY AND PROSE OF IT.
MISS C ITY: “Look at that gorgeous sunset, Uncle! The orb descending in a blaze of
golden splendor , tipping the clouds with glory!"
UNCL E: "Yes, blanlcy hot day ter-morrer."
“Nick Bottom”: Recent study of paleo-
lithic implements have led me to investigate brother
Binghi’s stone tomahawks. Before .me as I write
are four of these weapons—two from Booerie Creek,
Lismore (N.S.W.), one from Gatton (Q.), the
other from an unknown source in Western Queens-
land. There is not a flint among
them. The Booerie Creek specimens
have been ground, one from fine-
grained granite, the other from com-
pact basalt. Scattered throughout the
district from which they were col-
lected are quartzites and chalcedonies
which, owing to their conchoidal frac-
ture and superior hardness, would pro-
vide sharper and more lasting cutting
edges than either granite or basalt,
but Binghi seems to have chosen the
latter materials because they were
easier to work. The Queensland speci-
mens are of fine diorite and show
better finish than those from Booerie,
but this is probably owing to their
having been fashioned from water-
worn rock fragments. All the speci-
mens except the basalt -one from
Booerie are fashioned on tfte one pat-
tern, having their greatest length
from the cutting edge to the back of
the axe. The Booerie specimen has
its greatest length along the cutting
edge. When the Abo. Parliament next
meets, please table the following
questions:—(l) Did Binghi always
follow the line of least resistance
, , when choosing the material for his
oughts? (2) Or had he not reached the standard
ot intelligence which prompted the primitive men of
f, er nT” trieS , t 0 USe flint as a cutting medium?
Di,d he select the material on account of its
color, irrespective of its other qualities?

Pam O Shanter”; Here’s an easy way to
ascertain the live weight of a beast. Measure
round the animal close behind the shoulder ; then
a ong the back from the forepart of the shoulder-
blade to the bone at the tail. Multiply the square
of the gifth by five times the length (both ex-
pressed in feet), divide the . product by 2, and
you will have the weight of the four quarters in
stones, of 141 b. In very fat cattle the weight is
about a twentieth more than ascertained in this
manner, -while very lean animals weigh about a
twentieth less. The quarters are a little more
than half the live weight. The skin usually accounts
for about the eighteenth, and the tallow about
the twelfth of the weight of the beast.
“liambone” r Talking about the mysteri-
ous ways of Providence and donks, most Diggers who
went through the Somme winter of 1916-17 remem-
ber a corduroy road tha f t ran from Ginchy Corner to
Longeval Corner. It was one of Fritz’s favorite
targets, and many a good horse was tipped into the
ditch alongside. The artillery Diggers who were
packing ammunition to their pistols in Gun Valley
never lingered there. But one day came a muddy
bloke with a pair of mournful-faced donks, each
carrying four 4.5 howitzer shells. Quakily the
donks set foot on the slippery wooden road. Fritz
was waiting for them. Hardly had they got over
the brow of the hill when a five-nine burst a few
yaids short. The donks sat back on their haunches
and cocked their flop ears at the descending frag-
ments of mud and wood. More iron confetti was
coming, so the driver belted them,' coaxed, kicked
and cursed them, then, in desperation, twitched
their ears and twisted their tails. The brutes
wouldn t budge. By this time half the scenery was
in ithe air. At last the Digger reckoned he had
done a fair thing. Chucking the reins over their
necks, he said: “There, blast yer! If you don’t
value your bleeding lives, I blanky well do mine!”
and walked off down the corduroy. At once the
donks got off their haunches and followed like a
pair of Mary’s little lambs! Incidentally, they
hadn’t gone 25 yards when Fritz landed one where
they had just been arguing the toss.
* * * *
“Saxby”: Owing to the rise in the price
of cattle and the difficulty stations have in branding-
up, “poddy-dodging” has become an established 1 trade
about Cloncurry (Q.). Bands of men get away with
mobs of cleanskins from the stations and sell them
for £3 per head to receivers on the railway line.
If caught with the goods the lifters gallop away.
Most of them are well known, and are not unpopular
with the average citizen, who shares indirectly in
the easily-gotten wealth. Many people know when
a raid is on, and the result thereof is common know-
ledge a few days later. A few old-fashioned
people ,n Cloncurry still think that cattle-duffing is
blamable, but they are not bad-matured about it.
* * *
TVealsman”: My experience is that for
real hard work (belting fence-posts out of Murray
or Murrumbidgee red gum, for instance) a bit
of a dry white-box limb, saw n off close up to a
fork, to secure the “double crown” for that end
of the weapon, is the best thing for mauls. For
handles there is nothing better in any bush than
the scrub known as “prickly mones.” It has more
spring than blackwood or any other hevvn-hard-
w'°od and is practically unbreakable until it perishes
of old age. And if it is nicely fitted into an
inch and a quarter socket (leave the bark on the
exposed part) it will last longer than any ordinary
splitting contract. So will the white-box head of
the tool if shaped properly.
‘McNorth”: As an illustration of the
whole-hearted industry of some small, frail things
let me mention the performances of a species of
red ant which at certain seasons flourishes in the low
coastal country near Darwin (N.T.). This beast is
a mere atom, but I’ll back it to get through any-
thing not soldered. One nor’-west night, when the
sea-wind had fallen to a flat calm and the air was
filled with the uproar of mosquitoes angry at not
finding a gap in the net, two or three battalions
of red ants worked their way through and made a
massed attack on my face and hair. Reinforcements
poured in a continuous stream through the diapha-
nous mosquito-net, and even when I got up and
placed the legs of the bed in tins of water a couple
of million drowned themselves so as to make bridges
for their cobbers. After that I decided that the
mosquitoes were the lesser evil and went out and
slept in the open. In the morning I found that
the ants had eaten the bedroom candle down to the
last spot of grease and had bored through the cork
of a bottle of firewater standing on the table. They
had also gobbled up the toilet soap, afflicted my
shaving-brush with the moults and made away with
the best part of a box of matches. Also, my books
shed their leaves when moved. I was damn glad
I got up when I did.
* * * *
Melos”: Mrs. Binghi sometimes wore
unique ornaments. On the Upper Clarence (N.S.W.)
writer has seen the lady sporting a brooch made
out of a green and white stone rivalling the cat's-
eve and having the advantage of feather-weight.
The prettily-colored pebbles found in certain creek
beds in the coastal districts were favored by some
lubras; so were variously-colored seeds arranged
as a necklet. On the Richmond the “water-stone,”
a water-white stone holding in its centre a few
drops of water, was a decorative trifle. Nowadays
dark sister adorns her tube skirt and Taris hat
with violently-contrasted ribbons.

“Frank R.”: Some years back a squatter

MAC’S UNDISCRIMINATING TRAPS.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Tim Goorty owns an orchard west
Of Reid’s, below the Stone.
His peaches are the very best
That thereabouts are grown.
His pears (a case on every limb)
His neighbors sourly envy him.
But Tim was far from happy since
He found that thieves crept in
And rifled pear, and peach, and quince.
He seared his soul with sin
Blaclc-cursing them, and then he set
A man-trap the bold thief to get.
One morning down to Mac’s, they say,
He ra ced, and stammered he:
“The good man-trap that yesterday
Your storeman sold to me
There’s somethin’ wrong wid it, McCall:
It’s cot a woman, damn it all!”

A Plain
Fact!
Devonshire-street. It might have been new
in Queen Anne’s time, for tliq houses there
are all seventeenth and eighteenth century,
with carved Queen Anne doorposts and shal-
low oak stairs. But their former glory has
faded, and now they seem to nod at one
another, these old houses, and say, “Ah, we
know what we once were,” while little Lon-
don gamins and ragamuffins are born in them
apd shout round them. You see the rear of
Gray’s Inn, with its walks of lime-trees on
green grass, and daffodils behind an iron
railing, until you turn your back on Theo-
bald’s-road and go down Devonshire-street.
There you presently find an eighteenth-
century house, cleaned, and with (alas!) a
shop window in front of it. And inside are
books.
The Poetry Bookshop has been an active
centre for the encouragement, production and
sale of modern literature for several years.
It has also helped to revive the less known
mystic school of the early nineteenth cen-
tury. But the Poetry Bookshop’s most dis-
tinctive publication is a series of rhyme and
ballad sheets, and William Blake’s songs
(separately) set to music. There are old
and new ballads and folksongs illustrated
with quaint, bold figures, brilliantly colored,
in outline reminiscent of Albert Durer’s
little cocks and- hens and p6n-drawings.
They are all on a single sheet. There, too,
are to be found paper-backed books with
quaintly-lettered titles and covers, thin first
editions of the work of an unknown. A
prowler there would find hours slipping by
unheeded, and then would come away trans-
gressing the tenth Commandment.
Besides producing literature cheaply and
artistically, the Bookshop has another ob-
jective. Up the shallow oak stairs is a
room, and there at half-past five or six
o’clock each Thursday evening an audience
sits round on wooden benches in a candle-
lit attic listening to John Drinkwater, John
Masefield, Harold Munro, Maurice Hewlett,
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, J. C. Squires, and
others of the Georgian school give readings
from their own works. The audience is
small, as may he imagined, and 3d. is the
entrance fee to help pay the rent. But
there is the opportunity to go and hear
readings from the orig’nMs. sometimes before
publication, given by the Shelleys, the Keatses
and the Brownings of our own day. Of
course, not only original matter is read.
Sometimes a prose piece from an old master
is taken.
Two doors down, amongst the dirt of the
narrow street, is a Peasant Shop. Here are
pottery and necklaces and baskets, embroi-
dery and richly-colored homespun linens,
silks and slippers and rugs, beads and but-
tons and smocks. Poetry and Homespun.
The two go together somehow; is it because
there is something primitive about both?
And here, in Sydney, is there no central-
out-of-the-way room which could at least be
made a rendezvous for Australian writers
and literature? Australian and English
poetry, known and unknown, could be there
for sale. The candle, the attic, the bench
P°et must be lurking somewhere, and
the thing is to assemble the various parts,
including the audience.
K. MONYPENNY.
A Satchel of Books
The Skeleton Key (Collins, London). Bernard
Capes s latest, is a detective story. G K Chester
ton suggests in the preface that it has’much m
common with “Trent’s Last Case,” which is In
injustice to E. C. Bentley. There are the usual
spotlightings of alternate suspects until the denoue-
ls reached, and then the reader strikes zero
with a thump, leaving the remainder of the yarn
to read itself. However, the characterisation could
have been much worse.
The Talleyrand Maxim (Ward, Lock), by J. S.
hletcher, is 315 pages of third-rate mystery. The
maxim. With time and patience the mulberry
leaf is turned into satin,” is adopted bv a solicitor's
clerk for his own guidance. Every orthodox instru-
ment of thrill is used once more-—blackmail miss-
ing will, murder, etc. Long before the finish
one has read so much about the infernal will that
it is as irritating as the Scoundrel who is mis-
using it.
, Zanoza, by R. G. Kirk (A. A. Knapp, New
York), describes itself as “the thrilling story of
a Russian wolfhound”—which it isn’t. It is a
werewolf story and a failure. Also, it is one more
of those irritating demonstrations of how to evade
a difficult and tragic ending. Nothing is more
maddening to a reader, after having been worked
up in an emotional crescendo, than to discover
that the whole thing was a dream—particularly
when the evasion is as barefaced as in this instance.
Modern Germany, Its Rise, Growth, Downfall and
Future, is not quite one of J. Ellis Barker’s best.
He has written much about Germany and the sub-
ject is worn a trifle thin. Still there is much of
value in Modern Germany, and people who are not
already full of information should read it. Pro-
bably it will be more valuable • ten years hence
than it is now. By 1921) the unchangeable, plaus-
ible, persistent, subterranean Hun will be again
laying the foundations of World Empire. Ellis
Barker’s work will be a guide-book to the symptoms.
(John Murray, London.)
The Future Government of India, by Ernest Barker,
M.A., is a small book which can be recommended to
anybody who cares about India. It deals with a
matter in which Australia and South Africa are in-
terested. They would like India to be so well
governed that wild horses wouldn’t drag its people
away from it and in their direction. (Methuen and
Co., London.)
Leo Chiozza Money, of England, is the author of
Fifty Points About Capitalism. It is a useful book.;
Also it is one to be read with discrimination. It
shows how outsiders have been rnhbb'T , s ("-i.fi
others), whereas the local anarchist ignores this
view of the case and in his haste to loot the
jeweller’s shop at the corner and hold an election
meeting among the ruins, professes that we have been
robbing ourselves. No doubt we have, but for lack
of opportunity we didn’t do much. Our own people
stole 2d. in the £, while the importer got the other
19s. lOd. Chiozza Money’s tale of the stupendous
profiteers of England is a reminder that we are
among the losers, and that we require constructive
statesmen to build our factories and ships and make
us independent of the conscienceless crew'. But they
are not a reminder that we should wreck local
workshops and borrow more money from the profiteers
and vote for John Storey. Chiozza Money doesn’t
even mention John Storey. (Cecil Palmer and Hay-
ward, London.)
Shell Shock and its Lessons , by Drs. G. Elliot
Smith and T. H. Pear, has a wider significance than
the name implies. Though Shell Shock was invented
for use in the late war the suuject hasn’t died with
the war. The next shindy of the nations will call
it up again, and as that shindy is as certain as
death and a great deal more certain than the League
of Peace, investigation is far from wasted. In any
case Shell Shock is only a new exaggeration of plain
old Shock, which will be always with us so long
as houses fall down and bridegrooms don’t turn up
and the Unexpected goes about like a roaring lion.
In pursuit of the newly-named complaint many facts
about mental phases and diseases have been hunted
up and investigated. The two doctors —one of them
a distinguished Australian —disembowel their hi, -<ct
cleverly and amputate it in well-chosen diagnosis.
(Longmans, Green & Co., London.)
The Inky Way
“Ho IIo”: “S.T.S.” (B. 4/9/’l9) thinks
Stephen McKenna in “Midas and Son”
“threw away a chance” because he made his
multi-millionaire hero commit suicide on
August 4. 1914, when the newsboys were
crying “War with Germany,” instead of
making him enlist and die gloriously.
“S.T.S.” adds that the fact that the novel
“has carefully been dated up to 1914” em-
phasises McKenna’s stupidity. Can’t he see
that the author deliberately missed the melo-
dramatic hearse and caught a more artistic
’bus? Until “S.T.S.” cultivates a more
subtle perception he should avoid McKenna
and confine himself to Conan Doyle. He
certainly would not miss such a “chance.”
Archibald’s last photograph
—taken with Henry
Lawson.
“S.T.S.”: In
view of the com-
ing visit to Aus-
tralia of Rabin-
dranath Tagore,
and the sugges-
tion heard that
iie is a “Nation-
alist” as against
British rule,
note his own
definition of two
terms often
heard in connec-
tion with India
to-day. S w a-
deshi is the cor-
rect name for
the Nationalist
movement,
“which began
more as an
economic than a
political one,
having as its
main object the
encouragement of indigenous industries.” In
other words, Swadeshi merely aimed at en-
couraging the native manufacturer instead of
the importer (himself mostly imported). But
“Bande Maratam” is now usually heard. It
means “Hail, Mother!” and is the first
line of a song by the native poet Chatterjee.
This has been taken up as a national anthem,
and the singer can put into it. a good deal
more than the mere words expressed. In
fact, Bande Mataram seems to be the Sinn
Fein of India.
An interesting and eminently French ex-
periment is reported in a new book by
Douzat, of Paris, on the legends of the
Great War At a meeting of scientists a
squabble between several people was deliber-
ately got up. After order had been restored
the president called for a report from every-
one present, on the pretence of getting legal
evidence. The assembly of jurists, doctors
and psychologists described what they had
seen and heard. “Only one report contained
less than 20 per cent, of errors, 13 had more
than 50 per cent., and 34 had invented be-
tween 10 and 15 per cent, of the details.”
This shows, it is suggested, about how much
need be believed of the war-stories told by
excited people, even when they had no in-
tention of being untruthful.
“Six-and-Eight”: In London Punch of
June 25 a cartoon shows a 20-st. fat man
in the studio of a woman-artist saying. “I’ve
called to see if you could make a' miniature
of me.” After that don’t tell me the Pink'
’Un variety of joke does not appeal to
Paunch.
“Mr. Ocky”: R. Lewis James leaves the
chair of Geelong Advertiser, Victoria’s
oldest morning paper, after 10 years’ good
service. A Welshman, he returns to Eng-
land to edit another daily, and be near his
opera-singing daughter. Early editors of the
Advertiser include John Pascoe Fawkner
and James Harrison. The latter’s tomb-
stone at Geelong states that he was the first
to make a commercial success of the manu-
facture of ice.
Six months’ old and eight pages thick, The
Rifle demands the thruppences of Sydney
marksmen every Thursday. During the
coming N.R.A. meeting at Randwiek, the
young and enthusiastic editors will have a
tent on the range, and hope to get a lot of
new subscribers as well as the rheumatism
that seems inevitable.
“Norbell”: J. W. Roberts’s allusion to
Isaac Pitman (B. 4/9/’l9) reminds me of
an experience of the late W. J. Chiclley—
he of the bare legs and “The Answer.” Chid,
told me that his mother had been a friend
of Isaac Pitman, and had learnt shorthand
from him. Mrs. Chidley had been long dead
when Chid, unearthed a shorthand diary,
wherein his mother had recorded her
thoughts and history for many years. He
took it to a Sydney firm of stenographers
and they easily made a transcript. To poor
Chid, it seemed like a message from the dead.
“Black Bonnet”: Is verse-making heredi-
tary 2 And I wonder if my case is unusual.
My mother wrote verse. I have done so
since childhood, and of my four children
one is approved by The Bulletin and
Australasian; the next, a girl of 13, has
published very creditable stuff in the local
papers, and the two little ones string rhymes
as easily as some children say their tables.
So the gift, or bad habit or whatever it is,
has survived in three generations, to my
knowledge.
Swiftly across the pallid fields of tripe
Comes gushing Spring with poems all unripe;
I urge her on and tell her, “Call next year!
Can’t eat to-day—digestion’s rotten, dear.”
x.s.w. K.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Arne de Boue”: Will Lawson asks (B.
11/9/T9) why boiler manholes are oval and
not round. Men who enter boiler man-
holes are so poorly paid that they grow more
oval, in cross-section, than circular. They
only use the round blokes to clean the fun-
nels and stacks.
* * * ‘ *
“Ernanco”: A factory in a Melbourne
suburb was recently entered and sundry
valuable articles removed. The proprietor
succeeded in locating the robber, a boy of 11,
and under fear of the law extracted a solemn
promise of restitution within two days.
Next morning the missing items were found
in their proper places. The nipper had
broken in again during the night to replace
them.
* * • •
“R.S.V.P.”: This country, which burns
up a vast quantity of wattle-bark waste from
its tanning industry, could find a useful out-
let for such refuse. War-time tests in Eng-
land showed that used wattle-bark makes
high-quality brown paper. It is, however,
unlikely that anybody will put money into
an expensive waste-eliminating outfit until
buyers are obliged to get their supplies of
the products locally.
* * * *
“Doug”: U. S. Senator Hiram Johnson,
tipped as a possible candidate for Presi-
dent next time, boasted recently to a huge
New York audience that his country is
the “only solvent going concern nationally.”
It seems almost a shame to interrupt the
boasting with the reminder that only as far
back as 1907-1908 the American people with-
drew £300.000.000 of their deposits from
their own banks as fast as the tellers could
count out the money, and that Europe had
to ship gold across the Atlantic to steady
the tottering U.S. banking svstem.
* * • .
“Timo”: The legal shark still finds the
widow and the orphan juicy. A railway
ganger was killed recently in Queensland.
Uf the £6OO compensation coming to the
family the authorities invested £350 for the
benefit of dependants other than the widow.
A cheque for the remainder (£250) was sub-
sequently paid to the widow’s solicitor.
Gent, one in due course handed to the
widow’s i son a cheque for £lOO and a
receipted bill for £l5O, legal dues, commis-
sion, etc. At a Judge’s request the solicitor
supplied items of disbursement totalling
about £26, and was ordered to forthwith pay
into court the sum of £75, with costs.
• * * •
“Hamer”: The uprising of the bank
clerks has been a sudden and surprising
thing. A solid, comprehensive organisation
now exists and is already beginning to talk
gently but firmly to bank managements. But
the way to the Industrial Court is barred
by the Australian Clerical Ass., which,
having been granted recognition as the body
to represent all classes of clerical workers,
does not feel inclined to step aside. A sordid
inter-union squabble may ensue. To prevent
confusion the Court rightly discourages the
forming of more than one union in any call*
ing; and the A.C.A. meets the objections
of the Bank Officers’ Ass. to merging into
that body with a reference to its constitu-
tion, which permits sub-sections to have
their own officers and a complete control of
their own affairs.
*
“Gleniris”: Captain Joynt, V.C., who
a 4 e] y visited the Agricultural Show at Car-
diff (Wales) in charge of 500 Auseies.
earned his pre-war crust by running sheep
! a d ?. rs * s ' aiu^- . is captivated by
the Suffolk as a suitable breed of woollies
for this country. The Suffolk lambing-aver-
age in England is 133 p.c., all grades in-
cluded, while some flocks reach 150 p.c.
Using the heavy Suffolk for second-cross-
ing with a Leicester-merino crossbred, say.
the sheepman gets the right sort of export
lamb. Apparently the Vic. Agricultural De-
partment has the same opinion as Joynt.
because it imported some Suffolks five years
ago. and has since had a 160 p.c. lambing
average at its Werribee farm. Victoria
has increased her flocks threefold since
1913, but the duality hasn’t kept pace with
the quantity, the stock sales at Newmarket
showing a dreadful proportion of rubbish.
Somehow the Victorian cocky can’t realise
that it pays to get a good ram from a
sound breeder; he buys any old thing from
a r _ ; ghbor for 30 bob or so. and goes on
multiplying his mob of scrubs for a small
profit. Tim State is to blame in some
dpgree. What can be said for an Australian
Government which, while employing a bee-
expert. “can’t afford the money” for a full-
time sheep-scientist?
THE HIGH PRICE OF LIVING.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
We went to Moolandilly where
The giant gum-trees grow,
And they have such salubrious air
That quite a healthy glow
Shines in the cheeks of Niobe
Who, done in marble, gracefully
Stands on the stairs for all to see.
We ran upon the hills, and climbed
The scented wattle-trees,
And there exultinglv I rhymed
The blossom and the breeze.
“Here life is sweet!” I cried it.twice.
Old Sandy’s answer was concise:
“Eh, mon, it’s dear, though, at the price!”
One day we loitered at the pool.
Beneath the fall we sat,
But Sandy, cautious as a rule,
Recovering his hat,
Slipped well beyond his depth, and there
Clung to a snag, and gasped for air,
A shiv’ring image of despair.
The hotel rouseabout was called,
And to his duty ran.
He dived straight in, and overhauled
The poor old drowning man.
But Sandy, clinging tight, said: “See,
Me mon, ye'll no be savin’ me
Till I ken what yer charge micht be!”

The Secret of
Easy Shaving! *
Do you want quicker, easier, pleasanter shaves than you ever
had before ? Do you want to keep your face in the pink of
condition, free from pimples, ingrowing hairs, scratches, or
cuts? Then set your razor on a Perforated Hone. Take your
finest blade or your poorest; give it a few strokes or hone all
day, the result will be the same—a perfect shave. The
Perforated Hone is the only hone made that can be used by the
ordinary man, no barber’s skill or experience being required.
The small, deftly-rounded holes in this new hone absolutely dispose
of that hacking, pulling, irritating edge which no amount of old-
fashioned setting could overcome. The holes PREVENT WIRE-
EDGE and automatically produce a perfect, keen, shaving edge.
Try one—if it doesn’t make your razor shave to
your satisfaction, return it to us within thirty days
and get your money back.
Sold by all leading hardware merchants at 4/6, or
post free 5/-, from 13

The feature of that table is the heavy
writing-off. During the past four years
£61,031 of profits have been disclosed, but
no less than £32,558 has gone in writing
down plant and machinery. When the co.
took over the half-century-old Marshall busi-
ness, it decided to try to shake itself free
of the Shoe Machine Trust, the world-wide
combine which instals machinery only on a
royalty basis. At the end of its first year
the co. owned every cog in its factory, for
what plant it could not purchase outright
from independent machinery manufacturers
it btiilt in its own workshop. For a start
the innovation looked a success, but later on
the management apparently discovered that,
after all, there was nothing like the Trust’s
machines —despite all the hard things that
are said about the Shoe Machine Trust,
there is no doubt as to its efficiency and
alertness in providing for the continually-
changing fashions in footwear. So the Mar-
shall Co. finally decided to scrap a lot of
its own plant and put in the royalty machine
again. These replacements and depreciation
have, in six years, called for £38,555, and
there may have. been still further deprecia-
tion charged direct to Profit and Loss. De-
spite all this disturbance the co. has done
very well; its profits, before making the
plant-depreciation cuts, during the past four
years have averaged over 121 p.c. p.a. of
paid capital.
The reserves in the table are shown less
£5OOO of goodwill, which still figures among
the assets. This has been written down from
the £7500 which the co. paid when it took
over the old concern in 1911. Since the
first accounts were presented the balance-
sheet figures have moved this way :
1912. 1918. 1919.

Sundry debtors & cash 33,543 58,928 45,186
Stocks .. .. 62,090 76,693 79,672
Over the seven-year period £16,658 of fresh
capital has been got in, and liabilities have
increased by £21,176, together £37,834.
Meantime more or less liquid assets have ex-
panded by £29,125, while the book-value of
property and plant has grown by £6208.
Divs. all round have averaged practically 8
p.c. p.a.; but as a result of its plant-
experimenting the co. has only slightly im-
proved its financial position since it took
over. That is, visibly. But there are im-
provements which accounts can’t show. Thus
the business has expanded nicely, and Mar-
shall footwear has become more widely and
more favorably known. With reasonable
luck, and with plant troubles over, the co.
should soon begin to put on more weight.
Standard Rubber Co. of Selangor.
Ltd. —This Sydney co., which, holds 1193
acres on perpetual lease at Kajang
(F.M.S.), is now in its tenth year. Two
years ago the directors thought they would
soon be in a position to pay off the accumu-
lated 12 p.c. pref. divs. ; but market and
shipping troubles interfered, and there are
still arrears, though the directors anticipate
shifting the load early next year and being
able to invite the ordinaries to the feast.
If the market holds up and everything goes
well at the estate this season the hope seems
reasonable. There is £29,944 of ordinary
capital and £14,604 of 12 p.c. cumulative
prefs. The latter call for £1752 per annum.
Under adverse conditions, the co. last year
made a net profit of £4226 after writing
41 p.c. off machinery and 25 p.c. off build-
ings, furniture and livestock —£1058 alto-
gether. But the directors want to hang on
to something substantial, cash being re-
quired for further development work; so
far 792 acres have been planted (632 are
under tapping)," while the remaining area
available (315 acres) is being brought under
cultivation. For the past three years har-
vests have been: 1917. 135,6581 b; 1918,
210,2601 b.; 1919, 262.3861 b. For the cur-
rent year 280,0001 b. is the estimate. But
though last year’s production was 25 p.c.
greater than for the previous year, owing
to poor prices—for a while Singapore’s best
offer was 3d. per lb. under f.o.b. cost—only
a few pounds more was got from sales.
Since the Armistice the market has improved,
and, prospects being good, the directors re-
cently decided to pass out a 20 p.c. div. on
the prefs. to help wipe that slate. At
the balancing date (March 31) the. co. was
in a comfortable position: it owed only £935
and had £7644 in liquid assets, mostly cash.

Westralia’s gold-producing mines num-
bered 386 last year, as compared with ever
a couple of thousand 20 years ago. Of the
total 60 were on the Murchison ; 48 at Kal-
goorlie; 41 each at Yilgarn and Mt. Mar-
garet, w’hich includes Leonora, Morgans,
Burtville and Laverton; 37 at Coolgardie;
31 at East Murchison ; and 30 at North Cool-
gardie. West Pilbara had only two and
Kimberley none. Nearly 80 p.c. of the total
are small irregular producers, and most of
them are rarely heard of. Number of stamps
in operation was 2431, and that of other
crushers, such as ball and Huntingdon mills,
grinding pans, etc., 539. Value of gold-
extracting machinery ' was estimated at
£2,771,456. and more than half of this
amount was represented by Ivalgoorlie plants.
Dividends were -30.37 p.c. of the product
value prior to 190 S; last year they were only
12.64 p.c.

of the world is used
in making the Beale
Piano. Walnut, Rose-
wood, Sycamore, as

Maple and Black
Bean, are all treated
—in many cases being
worked up from the
rough log. The above

being stored in the

This illustration shows
a vertical saw which
is used for breaking
down the huge logs
into “flitches’* and
‘slabs” of workable
size. These are further
cut up into boards and
planlcB by our large
circular saws or cut
into veneers by the
veneer-machine.
Every log is carefully
chosen with the idea
as to its ultimate use.
We were the first firm
in Australia to start
cutting veneer for any
purpose whatever. The
veneer slicer shown
below will cut paper-
thin veneers direct
from logs, five feet
square by eight feet
long. As we are able
to cut our own veneers
,we can always select
the finest grains and
also use fine Australian
timbers which would
not otherwise be
available.
AFTER being treated in the
drying room, all veneer is
sent to the veneer store. Here
it is rigidly examined for
defects; assorted, graded, and cut into
various sizes. Great quantities are regu-
larly discarded as not being up to the
Beale standard. Not only must our veneers
be right in quality, but the graining must
be well marked. This making of veneer
shows how thorough is the determination
of the Beale organization to (thoroughly
control all processes which can affect the
quality of their instrument.
Every Beale Piano is
guaranteed in writing
for twenty five years.
This is just about twice
as long as most makers
guarantee their instru-
ments. It is a“worth-
while”guarantee, too.
The Beale Organi-
sation is here in
Australia, where it
can be called upon to
make good. > The
guarantee of a maker
15,000 miles away is
pretty hard to enforce.

Bracing as the Breezes
that brought the

From an Australian girl in London: —
Our branch of the A.I.F. Demobilisation Section
has left the old spot, the dubious attractions of
Horseferry-road, and moved to Lord Barnard's
commandeered residence in Belgrave Square. The
great mirrors and chandeliers of the ballroom did
not overwhelm us; but 14 panels of Australian wild-
iiowers—Christmas bells, bottle brush and Queensland
orchids —made us curious. The treatment of the
subjects seemed familiar; but it was not until an
ex-Govefnor of Queensland visited us and mentioned
that Mrs. Rowan was the artist that we • remembered
a certain exhibition six or seven years ago at Angus
ami Robertson’s in Sydney. Lord Barnard is said to
have had “interests” in Queensland.
■‘Absalom Jones”: The association in
Fuller drama at Sydney Opera House of A.
Brandon-Cremer as producer and Roland
Conway as leading man, recalls that the
latter nightly prays that the drama, “Face
to Face,” will not be staged. During the
first rehearsal of this piece at Adelaide
Tivoli, Conway as hero spoke the lines:
“And now to start my search for Hetty!”
Whereupon Cremer told him that he was
in an English production in which the
valiant youth had shouted: "And now to
starch my shirt for Hetty!” The story
proved fatal to Conway. He got through
all rehearsals, but introduced the laundry
at the first public performance.
Mrs. Brown, employed by the Vic. State
Government to tidy up after Henry Red-
tape has gone home to his evening meal,
is mostly a willing, respectable missus who
courts housemaid’s knee to provide her de-
pendants with tucker. Mrs. Brown has a
dreary job, performed in ghostly corridors
and tomb-like chambers. In the summer-
time she has no electric fan at her elbow ;
and in the winter the official fires are no
help to her because she has to clean out
the fireplaces and have ’em ready for the
rnornin’. Not an attractive life, by any
means; but the State reckons that a weekly
wage of 275. (id. covers its obligations. Small
wonder that the Office-Cleaners’ Union has
become a militant body and appointed an
organising missus to push things along. A
Government that can do no better than
275. 6d. for a bread-winner seems to need a
push.
“Allambie”: President James Kidd, of
N.S.W. Sheepbreeders’ Association, who has
recently returned from England, refers to
the United States, S’Africa and the Argen-
tine as possible growers of merino wool.
After dismissing the Argentine because
crossbred sheep predominate there to the
exclusion of the merino, he points out that
the United States merino sheep are at pre-
sent inferior to Australian, but considers
it a matter for congratulation that the
Americans are likely to get the embargo
against the importation of our sheep re-
moved, so that they can improve their flocks.
Is there any cause for rejoicing in that?
South Africa will soon be a strong rival in
the growing of merino wool, as the flocks
have been improved through the introduction
of selected high-priced Australian rams. Why
should we pursue the mad policy further, and
assist the Americans to obtain the removal
of restrictions against the importation of
our sheep? Let them have our wool; but
not the sheep that grow it. The buyer of
sheep for export can generally afford to pay
more for a ram than the home buyer, so the
best class of sheep in most cases leave Aus-
tralia to produce stock that will presently
compete against us. It is a suicidal policy.
During the war cargo space was found for
wool while wheat was left in the stacks, as
the British Government could buy wheat or
wheat substitutes nearer to Europe; but
there was no substitute for the Australian
merino wool. Is Australia going to sacri-
fice for all time that great advantage for the
sake of a handful of guineas?
As to padres and their value
“Alphonse Rex”: I resent “The Lamb’s”
statement (B. 4/9/’l9) that the padre is
an excrescence on our military system. 1
was a padre myself, and am not one penny
richer for any cash payment received during
my sendee. I saw every man on the old tub of a
transport every day, and knew every one of them
well enough to call him by his first name. While
“The Lamb” was being shorn elsewhere, I whs in the
hospital every morning for two hours, and not read-
ing the psalms all the time, either. I met a few
narrow-minded soldiers like “The Lamb,” but ask
most of the boys about padres in general, and you’ll
And a symptom of toleration here and there. My
friend Clune, M.C., and others have had their
services generously acknowledged by The Bulletin ;
and there were plenty of the same good sort.
’ “Satan”: “The Lamb” (B. 4/9/’l9) regards padres
in general as an expensive superfluity, just because
he met one or two wasters. He puts in five exhibits,
so here are five from me:— '
(1) Mackenzie (“Fighting Mac”), of the Salvation
Army, who in the early days of Gallipoli was found
guilty of carrying up ammunition and generally
helping the fight along. He excused himself on
the ground that he was helping Humanity against
the Devil.
(2) Father Fahey, who could always be found in
the front trenches. He is well known on Gallipoli
for his sniping affairs on the right flank.
(3) George Green (C. of E.), better known as
“Old Sol,” a member of the 2nd Light Horse, who
was always there when wanted. Later in France
he established his famous hut at the base and then
went into the field with the 13th Brigade.
(4) Father Bergin, killed in action, was never
content unless he was “with the boys.” Ask- the
13th Brigade what they thought of brave old
Bergin.
(5) Herrington (Pres.), who served for two
spells—one in Gallipoli and one in France I—a 1 —a con-
scientious and stern man of God.
“Seacombe”: “The Lamb,” who discusses padres,
confines his observations to their value on troop-
ships, and finds that most of them rendered little
service. I think the same could be said generally.
There were some great men among them, and every-
body was the better for coming in contact with
them. But it seemed to me, as a professing church-
man, that far too little care was exercised in the
selection of men for this work. I often wondered,
indeed, whether any consideration at all was given
to the qualifications required of men who were to
undertake this important church job; certainly
I have again and again regretted that religion was
—formally, so to speak—represented so poorly, due,
I think, to insufficient importance being attached
to the selection of suitable rpen.

The Longest Stretch of Road
seems short —in a Studebaker
WHEN it comes to the accomplishment of a long-
distance run, the solid worth of the Studebaker
becomes increasingly apparent. Miles and miles
are thrown behind—distance is eaten up —with a certainty of
performance that springs from the power of the Studebaker
engine and the reliability of the Studebaker Car.
Even when your motoring is done within the precincts
of the metropolis, or in the neighborhood of a populous
centre, where help is readily obtainable, this excellence is
well worth while. But when you venture out on to the
country highways, where road-surface, sharp gradient and all
the other bitter adversaries of the car are encountered, you
learn to appreciate the sturdy faithfulness of the Studebaker.
You learn to extend to it a confidence and affection that one
always feels for a tried and trusty friend.
And it is not only that the Studebaker does its work
with unfailing thoroughness. There is as well the strong
recommendation of how it does it. While you are being
transported over hill and dale with security and certainty,
you are enjoying the perfect ease and luxurious comfort that
this car insures. Moreover, the utmost in economical
running is gained—there is an absolute transmission of fuel-
consumption into motion. The tyre-mileage is remarkable
enough to be proverbial.
Any Studebaker owner will tell you —and tell you
enthusiastically—many, many reasons for his abiding faith
and confidence in his car.

[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“The co-operation and support of every league
opposed to liquor lias been secured in an attempt to
abolish the use of tobacco by 1924.” —lniormuiion
from U.S.A.
Now shall the great, dry land be purified
And thoroughly reformed from sea to sea.
'Lift up the holy gamp and wave it wide
And shout again for peppermints and tea.
Out pipe, cigar and slender cigarette!
The sin of smoking shall be vanquished yet.
The curse shall brea-k in 1924 ;
And after that new curses must be slain.
All evils that on Sundays we deplore
Shall leave our cities without spot or stain;
And newer evils we perchance may find
Exaptly suited to our cause and mind.
Sin-chasing is a great and joyous game.
The hounds are out. The pleasant time is ripe.
Reform! Reform! And in that sacred name
We catch the victim and his shameful pipe. ...
In 1936, or shortly after,
We’ll slay the last foul sin of simple laughter.

MAORILAND NURSES IN AUSTRALIA.
OUR CLIMATE AND GRASS FAVOR FORM.
It is one of those cases in which the comp,
has. disseminated the truth in spite of him-
self. He meant “horses”; but it is quite
all right as it stands. Ask any Digger.
The Commonwealth Bank goes on buying.
It has just paid £45,500 for the Mercantile
Mutual Insurance Co.’s premises at the cor-
ner of Pitt and'Rowe streets in Sydney—the
site on which in old days stood the shop of
James Bray, oil and color merchant, father
of the late J. S. Bray, naturalist. Rowe-
street was Brougham-place in those days—
or perhaps a little earlier.
Fond sister’s SOS in an Age advt.:—
Does anyone require the services of a youth, honest,
clever, artistic, with a kink for inventions, poster
work and mechanical work? He wants a job. Must
lie go into a tomato-sauce foundry to (■•scijie <L li-
tution ? It would be worth someone’s while to save
this bright young brain for his country. Anyone
who could help, please write Sisticr.
But why not the tomato-sauce factory?
Sister Australia mostly hates crawling,
creeping things, and she used to shudder at
the very thought of what poor Percy had
to put up with in that way in Egypt and
France. Yet if only Percy can keep his
hands and collar clean dear sister is quite
content that he should be a parasite instead
of an honest producer. There’s a lot that
sister might do for Australia and doesn’t.
“Mel Bourne”: Some Australian makers
of tool handles seem to think that any sort
of hardwood is good enough for hammer
handles. I bought six of these the other day
from one supplier, and got three sorts of
timber, none within eoo-ee of bluegum for
the purpose. Australian makers who hope to
keep American hickory handles off this mar-
ket with such poor substitutes will get a
jolt presently. What’s wrong with Queens-
land hickory, anyhow? Tough, strong and
elastic, its breaking strain at 17,5001 b. per
square inch is better than the average for
American hickory. I am one of the mob
that is sorrowfully turning down the present
Australian product because makers \Von’t
take the trouble to discover the right timber
to use.
“Vic.”: The International Socialist
gives an interview with Lenin, translated
from the Russian Worker and Peasant.
Lenin says proudly :
I am destroying the value of money. Our treasury
issues daily hundreds of thousands of notes, which
cannot be redeemed. We intentionally make them
worthless, by over-issue. All necessaries must be
paid for only by useful work.
And when a man who has by useful work
produced a cwt. of turnips wants a pound
of tea, will he have to dump the turnips on
the grocer’s counter? If three turnip-
growers call for three pounds of tea in one
morning, and have nothing but turnips to
offer in payment, the grocer’s household will
be rather fed up with turnips, and will yell
at the top of its voice for money—money
that hasn’t been “intentionally made worth-
less.”
The arrest of eight Chinese herbalists for
having “pretended to be doctors” is a great
worry to their army of women patients.
What particularly hurt them, when the
police raid on the Wings and Lings received
scoffing comment in the press, was the dis-
closure that the weird practitioners are
addicted to finding fault with everybody’s
liver. Swollen knee-joints, pains in the arm,
and ear troubles—all seem to have proceeded
from the one cause in Chinese diagnosis.
Allee welly bad liver.” It was satisfactory
to the patient as long as she thought herself
the only welly bad liver pebble on the beach.
But since she learned that no sort of com-
plaint was sacred from the liver-washing
treatment, and that hundreds of patients
suffered from “dirty insi’,” requiring daily
baths of dark and nauseous mixture, her
pride in her ailment has abated.
“0.K,”: What kind of peace-loving
Cabinet the new German “republic” has got
may be assumed from a letter written by
Erzberger, the Finance Minister, to General
Falkenhayn, when victory still seemed pos-
sible. The General was asked to furnish all
of his troops with flame-throwers, and was
advised that “all considerations of inter
national, law and humanity must be disre-
garded in order to gain victory over Eng-
land. That is the sort of man that still
guides Germany. The question for our
rising generations to consider is: “Will
English-speaking Governments adopt Sus-
picion as a policy, or will they resume their
wait-and-see’ gullibility and leave the
aggressive enemy to pursue his same old ends
more discreetly than before?” The minds of
nations long accustomed to Parliamentary
Government have little to fear from the
plague of Bolshevism, which originated in
Russian ignorance and serfdom, and cannot
make much headway where decent sanitarv
arrangements prevail. But the canker of
bf y u M£ al P , er A L It brou ? ht os with-
n the probability of. German world-conquest
and whether that probability will be revived
depends wholly upon our preparedness.

“His Master's Voice
Instruments or Records
The Government needed our Works.
To the thousands of the public who have been temporarily incon-
venienced through their inability to get many of “His Master’s
Voice’’ instruments and records which in normal times are always
available—and to “His Master’s Voice’’ dealers everywhere who
stood loyally by us —we feel that some explanation is necessary.
When war broke out “His Master’s Voice’’ hastened to the Nation’s aid. Disregarding the
fact that great temporary loss must ensue, the whole of our vast resources were offered for the
manufacture of munitions and gladly accepted. . Throughout the whole of Great Britain the
Government could find no other factories capable of perfectly executing the indicate and
infinitely delicate work that they entrusted to us.
Our sacrifice was not a small one—for as the war raged more fiercely and public entertain-
ment lessened, so did the demand for “His Master’s Voice” products increase.
To-day, with victorious peace concluded and the difficult transition stage nearly at an end,
we face the future secure in the knowledge that we are incomparably equipped to maintain
our absolute supremacy.
The public, undoubtedly, will remember the
part “His Master's Voice” has played.
Supplies will shortly be arriving regularly. Ask your dealer for catalogues or write to

For Your Liver
Pinkettes, the new laxative,
give excellent results in cases of bil-
iousness and torpid liver. People
who are unnaturally drowsy and
sleepy, who lack ambition and
energy, are usually victims of their
liver.
Pinkettes have a specific action
on the liver and speedily banish the
feeling of lassitude and weariness.
They are effective without being
drastic and they have none of the
bad effects of strong purgatives.
Pinkettes also regulate the stomach
and liver, correct bad breath, clear
the complexion, and are an ex-
cellent remedy to use during colds
and fevers.

“Buzz-Buzz,” the new “does-does” at Mel-
bourne Tivoli,. is vaudeville, dignified by
a becoming pair of curtains and an air of
decorum. The curtains serve as background
for some of the turns—for instance, Aldridge,
the ringing tenor, sings two consecutive songs
in front of the hangings, and then disappears
for ever—and when they are drawn aside a
comedy sketch, or what not, comes to light.
The most exciting of the what-nots is Minnie
Love’s musical presentation of-Maori maiden-
hood, the pretty picture of Minnie herself
being the leading feature, whilst a number of
other girls in similar attire paddle a supposi-
titious canoe. The effect of this sort of item
may be growing old, but the charm of it
remains good as new. Minnie Love has a
share in all the comedy sketches save “The
Christmas Tree,” wherein the humor is very
light and the satire positively subtle. And.
the lady from the Williamson co. counts for
much as a highly-ornamental actress with a
lively sense of humor. All the same, she
needs to reduce her tendency to facial con-
tortion when she is laboring to make a mushy
ragtime di’tty go for 30 times its real value.
Nell Fleming turns her little voice to account
in a rag which is less lamentable than Miss
Love’s solo effort; also she scores in a duet
with Phil Smith, who, by himself and in
collusion with other members of the co., is a
large portion of the entertainment. Stef
Macdonald, the Sydney young man with no
superfluity of music in his voice, has some-
thing of the old British music-hall touch, and
Miss Tommy Clancy is another newcomer who
makes only a faint first impression. Laurence
Ilardinge, Billy Itego, Nodin, Jessie Page and
Clarice Hardwicke do useful work in the
sketches, whereas Jean Keith merely gives
evidence of being there when wanted to
help pad out the programme. “Buzz-Buzz”
is a bright show that will bear a little
elaboration.
** * *
The outlook is promising for “Old Lady
31,” at Melbourne King’s, although the
humorous possibilities of that novelty in
stage fiction are only partially developed by
the present performance. The insufficient
agedness of Abe and Angie would matter
less if some other inmates of the Home
were not under the odds. Eily Malyon, who
can be a study in wintry humanity when she ■
chooses, is a conspicuous example of tart
“BUZZ-BUZZ,” AT MELBOURNE
TIVOLI.
Phil Smith as an American “producer.”
and early middle-age going to waste. In-
stead of knitting violently in an agitated
rocking-chair she could be earning good
money as a housekeeper or “help” these
times, and the same remark applies to Marie
D’Alton, Katie Towers and even Ada St.
Claire. The utter lack of decrepitude in
these alleged old ladies militates against the
effect of their combined attentions to 2-be.
They suffer by comparison with the palsied
granny who gets but a line or two wherein
to voice her interest in the new boarder.
But their want of wrinkles and rheumatics
is _ not likely to be fatal to a play
which can survive the unsuitableness of
Eardley Turner for the character of Abe.
His able-bodied appearance and optimistic
manner leave him no excuse for eating the
bread of charity, as a camouflaged Old Lady.
And Turner’s retired sea-captain is hardly
more convincing that Booth as his old salt-
sea friend who blows into the Home to
marry Blossy after 30 years of unavailing
courtship. How a bouncing, terra-cotta-
haired person like Blossy (Katie Towers)
came to settle down in an almshouse, in
preference to pairing off with her sweet-
heart-when-a-boy, is one of the mysteries of
the amusing piece. It would be more of a
mystery if the actor had a more human con-
ception of his part. There will be time for
him to moderate his gay guffaws and crude
peculiarities before “Old Lady 31” quits the
bill. Meanwhile young William Hill is
showing promise as the lover of Elsie Parkes ;
and Elsie is showing a dangerous disposi-
tion to talk in the affected tones of sister
Lizette (who ought to be granted a patent
for her way of speaking, in order to secure
her from imitations) ; and Maggie Moore,
in her somewhat minor part, continues to
make for I’ealism in the home.

The Tait brethren put back the dramatic
clock at the Palace by giving Emelie Polini
two more nights with “The Eyes of Youth.”
That postpones the first Sydney perform-
ance of “Daddies” until Saturday.
❖ ❖ :!:
“The Officers’ Mess” is in its fifth week at
Sydney Tivoli, where the free list is entirely
suspended. The sordid • habit of demanding
payment at the door is becoming disgustingly
frequent. Jazz teas now rage at this theatre
on Monday and Thursday afternoons. With
these and two weekly matinees, Hugh , I).
Mclntosh evidently hopes to keep all the
people in the Tivoli all the time.
All the week children, old and young, have
been pouring into Sydney Lyceum to see
Mary Pickford as Judy in “Daddy Long-
legs.” The screen version is very happy:
Mary must be just the Judy author Jean
Webster dreamed about. “Under the Green-
wood Tree,” though a long way from Hardy’s
novel, is an open-air love-story, with Elsie
Ferguson as the heroine. Her moneybags
were so heavy that she began to think all
men looked upon her as gold bait. However,
she Carmened. around in a caravan till she
found Prince Trueheart; and Hoyt’s and the
Haymarket tell all about it. Hoyt’s also
shows Sessue Hayakawa living a life of
renunciation and sacrifice in order to attain
to that superfine Japanese paradise known
as “The Temple of Dusk.” Crystal Palace
and Strand show the beautiful profile of
Olga Petrova in “The Panther Woman.”

Some of the surplus siller of show visitors
is going into the coffers of Harry Lauder
at Melbourne Princess’s. Scotland gives
good value in revivals of “Tobermory.”
“Stop Your Ticklin’,” “Ta. Ta. Maggie
Darlin’,” and the yawning tribute to belated
rising, and also heralds the approach of
thirsty weather with thickening allusions to
whusky and other wetceteras. Muriel Win-
dow gives her salad of songs,just the requis-
ite dressing, but in the roomy Princess’s she
needs all her voice and personality to stun
the back rows. Colin Crane’s baritone does
well in several ballads, and the dancers,

"Hello, Bill!”
Robert Toms (John Marvin) and Bill
Jones (John D. O'Hara).
Heather Belle and Sybil Warren, likewise
the acrobatic Montrose and juggling Creigh-
tons, furnish an energetic prelude to the big
event of the evening.
This is Show Week at Melbourne
Majesty’s, as elsewhere, and the frills and
furbelows of “Maytime” are holding holiday
audiences enthralled. Florence Young is
again a brief apparition in the weir(l gar-
ments of Leslie Holland’s third and most
loquacious wife, and George Welch now con-
ducts the auction sale which formerly kept
Phil Smith busy for a few minutes.
* sje *
At Melbourne Royal the American ladies
who contemplate divorce are still trooping
into the comic-opera hotel where Bill helps
drink the stock. Also the comic-opera
divorce court sits in the second act, and his
Honor continues to temper injustice with
tenderness where lovely woman is con-
cerned.

Dolores closes her Melbourne season with
a matinee at the Town Hall on Saturday,
the songstress having to make way for the
N.S.W. State Orchestra, with Verbrugghen
in command. The Orchestra starts on Mon-
day night and gives two matinees at the end
of the week.
Tom Mix heads the active list at Hoyt’s,
Melbourne, this week. As the leading hand of
“Treat ’em Rough,” he is only comparable
to a Texan cyclone. Bryant Washburn,
hero of “Venus in the East,” is also a
restless person. But then he is on the trail
of a petticoat. Lila Lee, >who has been pre-
viously seen in embarrassing situations, is
now discovering drama in “The Secret Gar-
den” and making tremendous use of the find.
Another item on Hoyt’s bill is the delight-
ful Peggy Hyland in the romantic “Caught
in the Act.” At the Britannia Anita
Stewart, as “Mary Regan,” is again trying
to forget the hereditary influence of a
crooked father. The Melba revived “The
Better ’Ole” on Monday, and to-day the
management promises the adventures of
Mary Mac Lane in the erotic thriller, “Men
Who Have Made Love to Me.”
_ Adelaide Royal is on a good wicket these
times. While the city has steadily bloated
and the population has grown more reckless
in expenditure on amusements, this house
has retained a virtual monopoly of new and
high-class drama. So the era of one-week
runs is past. Muriel Starr has thus to ex-
tend the life of “The Silent Witness,” and
the bloodstain will be produced and marked
Exhibit A for some extra nights. The King’s
is reopening to give pantomime with juvenile
players. The Majestic has a strong bill,
with Peggy. Pryde at the head of it; also, the
De Bakers give their striking statuary
show, and the' club-foolery of Frank, Lank
and Alice has been welcomed back. Where
the people come from who fill the Majestic
every afternoon also is nobody’s business
but their own. West’s have to put op “White
Heather” twice a day, too. A couple of
brisk shows are wandering around suburban
halls —McEwen, hypnotising ; Harry Eustace
pulling the ostrich’s leg and the python’s
tail on the screen, and personally explaining
how he did it.
Terry’s Theatre (London), where Edward
T. made a fortune out of “Sweet Lavender,”
of which 654 performances were given, has
been turned into a restaurant.
“Private Boxer”: Anyone noticed the re-
markable resemblance of Leslie Holland, in
his old-man make-up in the last act of “May-
time” to fellow-mummer Atholwood? Until
Holland spoke I would have betted that
Jimmy had entered on the scene. It wouldn’t
have been his first appearance on the comic-
opera stage either.
“8.J.” : Two recent visitors to Australia,
Cyril Maude and Connie Ediss, are booked
for the principal parts in “Lord Richard in
the*Pantry,” which is to be staged in Lon-
don, Connie came here early in the war.
and a prejudice against submarines helped
to delay her return. Her English press-
agent is careful to mention that she has
“spent the past five years in America.”
The campaign against ’flu in Vic. ter-
minated last week when all restrictions were
removed. McWhae, honorary Minister, who
took charge in May, when Bowser’s health
forced him to go for a spell, did fine work--
and took no pay! From January till the
end of the campaign there were 8224 deaths
in Vic. from the disease. Of an estimated
total expenditure of £230,000. it is expected
that the State Government’s share when un-
wanted equipment is sold will be £150,000.
The municipalities will have to find the
balance.
“Smilce” : It isn’t an easy job to turn a
foreign opera into English. It is necessary
not only to provide a rational translation
but also to accommodate the new language
to the rhythm of the music. The Dago
almost invariably stresses the penultimate
syllable, and there is great trouble in pro-
ducing an English equivalent which is almost
syllabically the brother of the original. Un-
avoidable differences are numerous; never-
theless, when a principal or the chorus sings
something longer than a phrase, it is hard
to detect that a good translation is not pro-
perly married to the score. It is in tho
singing of single words or short colloquies
that the English is most liable to sound
strained and awkward. Fqr instance, in
the first act of “Bohftme,” Mimi asks Itudolfo
who are the people outside, or words to that
effect, and as he goes to the window bis
warbled reply is “Amici.” Puccini wrote
the music for that three-syllable word, but
translated into “friends,” “pals,” “comrades,”
or even “cobbers,” the response in English
is trite and undramatic. Often the strange-
ness of the Italian gives a savor to the dia-
logue ; an English version almost inevitably
exposes the cheapness of the average Italian
libretto. One has only to hear Alfio howling
that his “heart is bro-o-o-ken,” not once but
several times in the final of “Cavalleria.” to
realise that Alf’s anguish is more , thrilling
in his native tongue.
“Fax” considers the stage kid :
Touching the question why the precocious stage
girl-kid is likely to be heard of in after-life, whereas
the precocious boy-kid isn’t, I suggest that there is
little or no difference in the proportionate number
of successes. There are, however, 10 or 20 times
as many girls as boys in the business, precocity
among girls (which means teachableness or imitative-
ness, in a great measure) being an almost normal
condition, whereas among boys it is unusual. The two
Girl-Princes in the Tower are played by girls; little
Willie in “East Lynne” is a girl; but never a small
boy is cast for Little Eva in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
Lord Fauntleroy was rarely a boy. The girls get
the good chances on the stage 19 times out of 20,
and among that multitude of phenomenons many
might be expected to train on. Yet apparently the
successes are so few that several of those lately
quoted by “II.O.” were not worth mentioning. For
instance, Virginia Bateman, Gabrielle Ray and Flor-
ence Smithson. The scores of girl-kiddies who boomed
their little hours on the stage, and were thought of
no more, are clean forgotten in the calculation. On
the other hand, it is not strange that the boy
phenomenons, being few and far between, should be
the more remarkable—when you get them. The
outstanding marvel of juvenile talent in stage his-
tory was 12-year-old Henry Betty, to whose Macbeth
the stately Sarah Siddorss was doomed to play
Lady Macbeth. The only high-priced star kiddie
within my recollection was Percy Roselle, though
another convincing youngster who never got a chance
to star was Harry Grattan—with his sister he
played offspring to Jefferson’s Rip Van Winkle, in
London. Master Betty proved to be just an ordinary
sort of young-man actor when he reappeared after
completing a college education, so he retired oil
the fortune his precocity had earned for him. Percy
.Roselle staled off into a mechanical young mummer,
like many a girl who has burst into a flood of
stage tears when she was a nipper. But Harry
Grattan developed into a theatrical person of note,
and would now doubtless be spoken of as an actor
if he were not busy as an author and producer. I
think of three conspicuously teachable boy mummers,
and one of them has made his mark in manhood. 1
think of 20 promising girl-kiddies who ail 'matured
into mediocrity or disappeared from notice entirely.
Where are the panto kiddie-songstresses of yestgr-
yeai ? We get a fresh pair of phenomenons every
Christmas. Toots and Lorna Pounds are exceptions
that prove the rule.

A Maxwell Motor Car, carrying four passengers, was driven
22,022 miles in all kinds of weather, over all kinds of roads—sand,
mud, slush, dry and wet —without once stopping the motor. This
official record was made by a Maxwell Car under observation by
the American Automobile Association. That proves the Maxwell

Mrs. Alice Austin, who passed out in Mel-
bourne the other day, was a shapely member
of the J.C.W. chorus 20 years ago, and was
well known throughout Vic. and New South
for her work as a member of Willie Gour-
ley’s Comedy Co. Her chief metropolitan
success was gained as Bella, the cullud cook
in Johnny Sheridan’s “Fun on the Bristol.”
“J.F.H.” (London) : These Diggers are
upsetting all our old tradition)*. It is noted
now that the applause at Covent Garden is
far more demonstrative than it used to be,
and it’s all ascribed to the kick-off given on
the opening Melba nights by contingents of
khakied Australians in the gallery. Of course
their enthusiasip has to be explained, so one
London daily says that to the overseas sol-
dier “grand opera is a dazzling novelty,”
Australia never hearing anything more.musi-
cal than a tin-whistle or a bunyip.
“Epacris”: At one time Edison records
sung in Italian and produced in Milano were
obtainable in Sydney, and several excerpts
of Leoncavallo’s “Boh&me” were to be had.
Why should “0.K.” or anyone else object
to a work being set to music by more than
one composer? Has not “Faust” been
handled b.v both Gounod and Berlioz? And
“Mephistophele” by Boito is somewhat on
that theme. Verdi wrote his “Otello” many
years after Rossini had treated this same
subject. Nicolais’s “Merry Wives of Wind-
sor” is much older than “Fals'taff” by Verdi.
Therefore why object to two versions of “La
Boh&me”? Murger’s work certainly holds
enough material.
Smike : May I butt into the argument
between “Harrison ’O.” and “0.K.” to re-
move the latter’s scepticism regarding Leon-
cavallo's “Boheme”? This opera was pro-
duced at the Teatro della Fenice (Venice)
on May 6, 1897, and though Puccini’s opera
was being staged at another theatre in the
same city, Leoncavallo’s version had an im-
mediate success. As a matter of fact, it
has since remained in the repertoire of
sundry companies in Italy on account of
musical qualities which have a particular
charm for the native ear. Leoncavallo’s
“Boh&me” is in four acts. Both musicians :
extracted the molasses for the libretto from
Henri Murger’s “Vie de Boheme.” (
“0.K.,” the original contributor to this i
discussion, ends it:— j
“II.O.;” on the “La Boheme” question, returns 1
to my original paragraph, asserting that I “re- *
ferred to the fact that Melbourne Herald attributed 1
the authorship of ‘L’Aniico Fritz’ and ‘La '<
Boji&mo’ to Leoncavallo.” I didn’t. I said Mel- 1
bourne Herald put “L’Amico Fritz” down to the <
dead man’s account, and associated him with “La (
Boh&me”; while the Argus spoke of the latter as a
the fourth of his. opera productions. That is to s
say, the Herald guardedly mentioned the name of -
the famous opera in connection with Leoncavallo r
(without calling aitention to the fact that the t
Australian public knows only of the “La Boh&me” 1
which Puccini composed), while the other paper was c
obviously crediting the dead man with the living f
man s brilliant success. As to my argument that
only one “La Boheme” has any real existence (in
operatic repertoires), there is no gainsaying it.
H.O. refers me to Thomas Kyd’s “Hamlet,” and
asks me whether the other “Hamlet” has no “real
existence.’ I say that Shakspeare’s tragedy has
blotted out the other, if it ever existed, as a
theatrical entertainment. A manager who adver-
tised a revival of “Hamlet,” omitting mention of
the author’s identity, and then gave them aught
but Shakspeare, would commit a fraud upon the
public. However, to show my profound knowledge I
mention that Hamlet, by Thomas Kyd, was cer-
tainly not “a favorite play in 1589.” Charles
Knight,, an accepted authority on everything con-
nected with the bard, doubted whether there ever
was a “Hamlet” play produced before Shakspeare
came along, and questioned whether any Kyd wrote
one. The one undoubted fact re the alleged play
is its disappearance from print, if it ever was
printed. The only Shakspearean authority who has
pinned his faith to the vague Kyd tradition wfis
the untrustworthy Malone. But these remarks
are away from tlie point. I introduced them only
to add force to my ffcal blow at the untrustworthy
“H. 0.”
“Smike”: This is the eighth season of
Dolores in Australia, and the veteran’s en-
during voice advertises the care that has
been taken of it. First, there is an almost
religious abstemiousness. She hasn’t touched
a stimulant for years, and has shackled her-
self to a routine that would appal her more
irresponsible competitors. Under the care
of faithful Madame Vaudour, she lives in
deep seclusion even when travelling, and
only the most intimate friends penetrate her
privacy. One of her little habits shows her
meticulous care. She never goes to concerts
at night without burying her head in a
wrap or a shawl. Nothing can induce her
to uncover and risk letting the night air to
her sacred organ.
“S.”: “Maytime” is another old people’s
play, an epidemic of which has broken out.
It is infested with the relics of a distant
past, who creak when they bend, and hobble
on sticks, and somewhat drearily lament the
days of the crinoline and the hat that looked
like a ruffled badger. People’ say it is a
pretty play, and affect to be deeply stirred
when a ricketty old party dating back to
pork-pies and strapped pants hobbles upon
the love of his youth, now a substantial
dame of 70, and yearns over lfer in a voice
thick with treacle. But in truth no love
that has been buried 30 years will bear
resurrecting; more especially by the original
principals. It is an act of moral body-
snatching to attempt such a thing, and at
Maytime” I felt like crying out with Mark
Twain: “Pooh! Who opened that grave-
yard?” There is no hash-so obnoxious as
warmed-up, love.

“Fax”: References to the “misfortunes”
of poor Wallace Brownlow, and the sugges-
tions that he _ died of want of employment,
make me tired. Society is a con-
spiracy for disguising the truth about the
effect of too much liquor on its own wel-
fare. Personally I make no complaint
against drink, but I do protest against my
fellow-man’s hypocrisy where drink is con-
cerned. Why not charge all its sins to the
debit side of its account? Heaven knows
we never forget to magnify its virtue in
song and story. I’m for telling the truth
—snatching solemn facts out of the wowsers’
mouths, and leaving them to starve. Were
there candor among the reckless there could
be no canting among the careful. But can-
dor is rarely associated with even the good
fellows of this world. In the last letter he
ever wrote Wallace Brownlow made mo
mention of drink. He blamed theatrical
managers at large for turning him down.
“Fax”: The other week a concert adver-
tised in Paris was stopped by the police
because the programme was mainly Wag-
nerian. It was clearly a case in which pro-
German influences were at work under a
'thin pretence of being employed in the ser-
vice of art. Precious few French people can
be so. truly fond of Wagner’s music that they

want it apart from the operatic effects with
which it harmonises. As music, pure and
simple, it can never have the charm of
Italian or French for the races whose
language is not harsh and guttural. As to
whether the Germans love Wagner’s music
because it is distinctively German and they
are proud of it, or because they think it
sweet, only the German Gott knows. But
as for countries other than Germany and
Scandinavia, I predict that the time will
come when no police - prohibition of Wag-
ner’s music on the concert nlatform will be
necessary. The enduring charm is not in
it. I can personally testify to having out-
lived my belief in the overture to “Tann-
hauser” or any other “popular” Wagnpr
item that one hears at orchestral concerts.
Twenty hearings of any music by the
immortal Richard rendered in cold
blood by an orchestra in a chilly hall, ex-
haust my capacity for being mb'ved by it,
whilst my admiration for other great musi-
cal compositions is growing stronger. The
conservatoriums, it is true, still teach that
Wagner’s music is as appetising as Cleo-
patra’s beauty. But I maintain that it is
ore of those acquired tastes of which one
eventually gets full up—meaning the music
torn from its operatic surroundings. Against
a stately spectacular opera, such as “Lohen-
grin,” I have, of course, nothing to say,
except that, in the words of Katisha, it is
a bit bloodthirsty.
“Cold T.” : Cyril Ritchard, who has been
making a success of Hopkinson Brown in
“Going Up,” was a med. student at Sydney
Uni. two years ago. The dance “Memories,”
which became a feature of the J.C.W. pro-
duction, was the versatile youth’s invention.
“H.E.P.”: If cheers mean anything the
Russian Bolsheviks have plenty of sympa-
thisers in Sydney. In a city “palace” re-
cently a Gazette of the ' World picture
showed Lenin and Trotsky, and the burst
of hoorays they .got would have made any
home-grown politician green with envy.
“Ike. Pagliacci” : Mention of Harry Diver
recalls how he once gave a touch of heart
disease to some Adelaide business men. At
a time when the_ police had decided to clean
up the city again, a party of card-players
were gambling in the back room of a pub at
which Diver was staying. They kept a good
watch on all ways of approach except the
one leading further into the hotel. On this
door at about midnight came a thundering
knock. There was a scurry for stakes, several
attempts to look innocent, and a rush by the
more scared to get out of the windows.
“Open the door!” called someone, and it was
at length opened, revealing in a dressing-
gown the {esthetic Diver, a tumbler in one
hand and a tiny bunch of flowers in the
other. “Pardon, gentlemen,” he said: “I
am sorry to disturb you, but I am looking
for some fresh water for my boutonniere.”
“Ox”: The accident to Carl Formes dur-
ing the duelling scene in “Faust” at Sydney
Majesty’s proves that all the danger-spots
are not in the movies. Allan Wilkie had a
bad accident while duelling in “The Story
of the Rosary.” In “Seven Days’ Leave” a
stage-hand broke his arm while working a
submarine effect. Soubrette Fanny Erris
broke her leg on the stage. Olga Agnew, at
Sydney Royal, two months ago, was stabbed
in the face by a bit of tin armor, and the
hurt is not yet quite healed. Even the
audience-has to take its chances. When the
Gonsalez co. was in the midst of the Anvil
Chorus in Brisbane a chip of steel flew into
the stalls and blinded the eye of a patron.
“Vaudeville Vet” : After ail, a rough audi-
ence is not so bad as a half-witted one.,
Comedian Sid Doodey has an act in which
his partner, when just about to sing, finds
the drummer missing. Sid volunteers for
the job, and, of course, never hits the right
note. At Accrington (Lancs.) he finished
his act with the house silent as a morgue.
The manager came round to his dressing-
room and suggested a change. “Put on
something funny,” he pleaded, and added
apologetically: “Y’see, lad, We’re pretty
good musicians up here.” The drummer had
been taken seriously. With the incident
fresh in his mind Doodey noted that the
Ashton-under-Lyne band was advertising for
a drummer. He applied and named the local
music-hall as the testing place of his talent.
The band Committee, accompanied by its
conductor, attended, but the committee had
been put into the joke, and when Doodey
waved the • sticks they applauded vigorously
and proclaimed that he must be secured at
any cost. The conductor became frantic.
“Empossibeel!” he shrieked, covering his ears.
“He cannot keep ze right time.” The com-
mittee. however, over-ruled all objections,
and an adjournment was made to a hotel,
where Sid gave another horrible exhibition.
The committee’s enthusiasm was more tre-
mendous than ever. The conductor was
almost demented. Gradually he warmed to
Sid, who gave another demonstration with
one hand holding a glass of beer. When the
comedian showed how to beat the drum while
firmly grasping a pewter pot between the
teeth the Italian became as enthusiastic as
the committee, and at closing time Sid
Doodey signed a contract amid tremendous
hiccupping. It is the only one the little
man ever broke.
“Ox”: With the principal actress feeling
jinwell, “L’Aiglon” would go nearer scaring
an understudy to death than any other part.
It has 148 sides, 52 being spoken in the
second Act. during which L’Aig remains on
the stage from her first entrance to curtain
fall, and there are no opportunities to
freshen the memory. Worse than that,
however, is the Wagram scene where the
ghosts go by. Nap’s boy speaks 80 sides
without any cues other than the moans of
the phantoms—about the toughest proposi-
tion playwright ever put up to actress.
From the neighborhood of Broadway:—
Australian Cyril Keightley is doing well here,
and his wife, Ethel Dane, is also prominent. Ethel
was in “A Little Journey,” lately running at the
Vanderbilt. Young Harigan, who will be remem-
bered in Australia as Jimmy Gilley with Charles
Millward in “Bought and Paid For,” has come
back as a war-scarred veteran of the 77th Division
(it doesn’t take much campaigning to make an
American veteran), and his name now monopolises
the electrics in a piece called “Acquittal,” staged
under the management of Cohan and Harris. Cyril
Maude hasn’t yet exhausted his popularity on this
side of the Atlantic. He is on the ci-est of a boom
in “The Saving Grace” at Toronto.

OVER!
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“The influenza epidemic in Victoria was officially
declared over yesterday, and the managers of all
places of amusement were officially notified that
normal conditions might be immediately restored.”
The scourge accurst has done its worst—
At least, for just the present—
And statesmen in statistics verst
Are talking nice and pleasant ;
E’en where a sneeze denotes disease
That calls for treatment chemic,
They give the stricken person ease—
It is not epidemic.
In tram and train one rides again
Without the least misgiving;
The dead are gone; few germs remain
To terrify the living;
Wise doctors still discuss the ill
With theories polemic,
But tell you, when you pay the bill,
“It is not epidemic.”
The kirk, the Zoo, the pictures, too,
Are freed of all restriction,
And fellows keep this fact in view
To soothe a friend’s affliction ;
To him you may most truly say,
In language academic:
“Who died of ’flu but yesterday
Survived the epidemic.”
VICTORIA.

The main result of the proceedings at
Rosehill on Saturday was to surround the A.J.C.
Derby, the Epsom and the Metrop. with still more
confusion. However, there was one performance
which emphasised the possibility of the Caulfield
Cup being lifted from Melbourne. Ardnaree, who
had run well up in the Tramway Handicap at Tatt.’s
meeting, took the second division of tire Rosehill
Handicap easily, with 121 b. more than his Cup
weight, running the mile and a quarter in “Hi.” If
he was in the Metrop. there wouldn't be much else
in the betting.
For the first time the three-year-olds came to-
gether at evens in the Guineas. At the end it was
heads only between Elfacre, the Maorilander Golden
Bubble and the Memsie Stakes winner Artilleryman.
With 12 furlongs to go and Derby weights up, it
might be that way again, with the heads differently
placed. But it was a muddled race, in which three
or four of the others had more than a fair share
of bad luck and ->oor riding. With seven furlongs
to go, Richmond Main and Gambler’s Gold were
extinguished. For the first two furlongs Bigaroon,
who started on the outside, travelled at a sprinting
pace to get round the accompanying bunch of 14.
Milleme had all the tails in front of him for half
a mile. The problem of the moment, therefore, is:
What allowance must be made for these various
circumstafices ? But, after all possible explana-
tions are made for the failure of this or that, the
facts remain that Elfacre won all the way like a
good colt, that he shook off a good run by Golden
Bubble in the last furlongs, and was travelling well
at the end, though Artilleryman was then doing
the best of the three. Had he been pushed earlier
ne might have won. Nevertheless he was doing no
better than Milleme, who, though he gave the leaders
10 lengths’ start at the turn, yet finished fifth, mat
behind Bigaroon. • ’ J

Six different sires were responsible for the
winners of the six races at Eagle Farm (Q.) last
Saturday. It was a latter-day record for Bananaland,
where the offspring of Syce have a habit of pre-
lominating.. On Saturday he was responsible for only
Boy Syce in the welter. The principal race, the
September Handicap (If mile), was won by the joint
favorite Abgull, who is rapidly running into form.
In the Open Handicap (7 furlongs) the respectable
time of lmin. 264 sec. was put up by Ercanil, who
won unexpectedly. His dam, Oweenee, will be re-
membered as a very uncertain performer on Sydney
suburban courses.
“Kaylee”: Peter Timmens. trainer of

an Australian rifle team which competed at Bisley.
limmens, by the way, was never a serious rifle-shot
till just the selections for the English trip
were made. Then he did some sudden and sensa-
tional shooting at the butts at Orroroo (which at
same time produced the King's Prize winner,
S/\ Addison), and got the selection. After the
English tour he just as lightly threw the game up.

“Aklce”: How does this stand for luck?
A benevolent investor in Tatt.’s recently sent for
two tickets in his own name and gave one of them
to his younger brother, a student. The student's
ticket drew a good prize and the other a blank,
borne time afterwards big brother received a demand
from the federal authorities for income-tax on the
win. He passed it to younger brother. But
younger brother was again stony ; so big brother had
to part up the tax.

* O.K. : High prices rule in some cases
where the profiteer has no say. He doesn’t, nod to
the horse-auctioneer, for instance; nevertheless a
recent sale of yearlings at Doncaster (Eng.) fetched
record bids, one colt going at 11,500 guineas, and
the 230 sold during the week averaged 971 guineas.
The writer remembers the time when the highest
price paid for a yearling thoroughbred in England
was 930 guineas—for a colt by the Plying Dutch-
man. The bidding at Doncaster was absurdlv reck-
less, of course. A considerable percentage of those
infant horses will never win a race’,' and some will
never see the starter. Ip the (lavs when prices were
far less immoderate it was not unusual for a wealthy
racing man to invest £lO,OOO in yearlings and still
miss a prize. It happened, however, that the notori-
ous Boli Sievier paid 10,000 guineas for a filly
(Sceptre) that proved to he a wonder, bringing his
money back 10 times over, and since then the price
of beautiful high-bred racing stock lias gone higher
every year—except at war-time. But the Sceptre
success has never been repeated.

“Snell”: A man who has just been passed
out from a prominent place in Melbourne’s suburban
public life had some excitement on his entry thereto
long, long ago. He had put up for the local
council, with awful noise and marked prodigality,
and seemed to be getting deep into the affections
of a grateful people. One Saturday he attended a
Mg football match on the suburb’s grounds, and
sunned himself in the warmth of general favor.
When the game was over and the crowd was surging
forth, he surged with the rest, and just outside
the gate had a reception that warmed the cockles
of his heart—temporarily. The representatives of
the younger generation drifted to him. Blank did
not know whether they were bent on bearing him
shoulder-high, or meant to demand a speech. lie
began to think presently the demonstration was a
little rough perhaps, but not until he was down in
the thick of it, and the boot was coming in, did he
recognise that he was the victim of a fond
delusion —his or the crowd’s. The police rescued
him, and as they bore him off one said: “Sure.
Mr. Blank, I’d have thought you had better sense
than to go to a football match in this suburb
in a white flannel suit.” Poor Blank had been
mistaken for the umpire.

Victoria is now going in for a form of
sport which combines business and pleasure. Fox-
drives, with dogs and beaters and gunners, are fre-
quent in the more populous farming districts. Of late
the pest has done much harvesting of young lambs,
and the murderer is so
greatly increased in num-
bers that he is a familiar
visitor to henroosts within
a few miles of Melbourne.

Frank Lave r,
battling hard for life in
Melbourne as The Bul-
letin goes to press, was
one of the greatest all-
rounders in Australian
cricket. During 20 years
or more he scored over
10,000 runs and skittled
500 wickets for East Mel-
bourne. In inter-State
matches he smote 3076
runs and gathered 123
wickets. He was in the
1899, 1905 and 1909 Aus-
tralian Xl’s (in the last
two tours he also acted as
manager) ; but when the
Board of Control took
over the management of
Australian tours he drop-
ped out of big cricket.

The 50.000 spectators at Vic. Teague semi-
final on tlie M.C.C. ground on Saturday showed that
football is still the people’s game. South, with
several stars on the casualty list, put up a hard
fight against its younger rivals, Richmond ; but
when the latter got a four-goal lead early in the
last auarter South’s cake looked dough. The Red-
and-Whites made a last dash, scored two goals, and
almost promised to pull the match off. But their
opponents came again and pushed their way into
the final by 14 points—73 to Souths’ 59. A clean,
fast and not unnecessarily genteel game.

Over the “gates.” which have been large
all through the season, the League is looking cross-
eyed at the V.C.A. None of the cricket clubs own
the grounds,' but they have spent largely in im-
proving them. To-day, however, cricket revenues are
a fleabite compared with those from football, and
Leaguers naturally feel sore at the huge slice the
cricket clubs take of the apple. Thus the Carlton-
Richniond match 10 days ago yielded £704 gross.
The amusement tax, gate-keepers and necessary exes,
took £l2B, leaving £576. Out of this the Rich-
mond C.C'., for the loan of its stands, fences and
the public’s ground, grabbed £32S. The clubs that
gave the show and drew the crowds got £124 each.
No wonder the League goes sour.

On the East Melbourne ground ’Scray and
Brunswick provided amusement for some 17,000 par-
tisans. Play was strenuous, and occasionally spite-
ful : also not unduly scientific. Still, it satisfied
half the crowd. The other, the ’Wick half, will
be dispassionate spectators next Saturday when the
minor premiers, North, meet ’Scray in the very last,
ultimate, conclusive “final” for the season. ’Scray
beat ’Wide by 59 points to 46, and as ’Wick had
beaten North by 61 to 52, a mathematician would
assert that ’Scray must beat North easily. But
mathematics have nothing to do with hoofbail; if
they had there would be less joy in the game.

N. S. Wales Rugby League competition
shutters went up on Saturday when Western Suburbs
took the City Cup, for the second year running,
beating Glebe by 14 points to 10. It was a bitter
game, and the fact that both teams featured the
finest forwards in the League made it unspectacular.
Kach side scored two tries, but Wests piled up
four goals against two. In the first half umpire
McMahon caught the fag-end of a dust-up between
Ogle (Glebe) and Connolly (Wests), and the latter,
though not the aggressor, got his marching orders.
On the blind side the forwards used the boot
illegally and with great persistence, but the touch-
judges failed to see much that needed reporting.
In landing two goals v. Glebe on Satur-
day, A. McPherson (Wests) scored most points (97 —
44 goals and three tries) in N. S. Wales Rugby
League competition matches this season. Wally
Messenger (Easts) was close behind (96 —45 goals
and two tries).

The wandering Australian Rugby League
-VHI smashed Auckland (the stronghold of the game
in M.L.) on Saturday by 32 points to eight.
Under Australian rules Paddington de-
tected East Sydney by 76 points (11 goals It)
belli nds) to 56 (8 goals 8 behlnds). At the end of
the third quarter Easts led by 48 —29, but Padding-
ton bogged in and scored 47 points to eight. A
stirring wind-up to a not dazzling season.
* * * *
The “finals” system is providing Adelaide
with plenty of eleventh-hour excitement. The pre-
miership does not go to the leading team on the
whole season’s play; that team is called merclv
“minor premier,” and has to play off with the next
three on the list, having as its only privilege a
right then to challenge, the winners. Often, of
course, the “minor premiers” are the winners them-
selves; sometimes (especially in football) they can
win a return game after losing the final; some-
times they have no hope with a lately improved
lot. This last is now the case in lacrosse with
East Torrens. They won 14 games during the season,
and lost one. The one was a 10 to 0 beating by
Sturt, and, though Sturt’s record for the winter
was only 11 won and four lost, East Torrens got
two more bad lickings in final and challenge. This
gives Sturt again the premiership, which they held
in the last five seasons of play—that was before the
war. The “finals” idea is hitting the same district
in exactly the opposite way at football. Comfort-
ably minor premiers, they have gone stale lately,
were outed in a semi-final, and are now pulling them-
selves together to challenge the final-winners.

“H.V.E."’: The Sydney hand-liner may
still get results from the rocks stretching from
the northern end of Balmoral Beach to Chinaman’s
Beach, a littoral of about half a mile. I have
taken there blue groper, red monvong (sea-carp),,
flathead, black bream, blackfish, odd flounder, mullet,
kelp-fish, blue-belly (lilac-banded parrot-fish) and
smaller members of this gaudy tribe, and a few
other sorts. The slimy and horrific but still quite
edible estuary catfish is common, especially on warm
summer nights, when it swims high, leaving a
luminous, phosphorescent trail in its wake. At one
point—just, where the cliffs angle off towards China-
man's Beach—great blue groper slowly pass at high
tide through a narrow kelp-fringed channel, but on
returning after their erab-chase on the sand-flats the
big fellows shoot through at terrific speed, fearing
attack from some prowling wobbegong (carpet shark)
or hungry blue-pointer. Hang a crab or lump of
eungevoi stoutlv hooked from a strong line in this
passage, keep well out of sight, and the nigger-
lipped giant may be yours. Beyond the pas-
sage is an isolated rock of fair height, from which
red bream may be got. But make the passage
while the tide is low. Once as the writer was
crossing nearly waist-deep and had just got foot
number two ashore, a wobbegong about 9ft.
long swept past. About 4 or 5 o’clock on summer
evenings the sea-carp come along skirting the kelp
closely. They like crab or eungevoi. Flesh-bait
they scorn. Quair.t old-wives (pearl perch) scurry
towards their feeding-grounds on the mud-flats in
small companies, but will rarely bite. The old-wife,
by the way, is a nice, sweet table-fish. A netter
once presented me with a dozen or so caught off
Chinaman's. Fried they were excellent. But this
fish doesn’t (or didn’t then) - find much favor in
the market. Silvery drummer (first cousins of the
blackfish) sometimes appear in shoals, hut are in no
wise eager to bite, and, anyhow, are coarse eating.
"Where the bottom is sandy you may annex an odd
whiting or two, but these aristocratic and much-
persecuted fish usually flash by at top speed and
don’t stop to bite. I’ve seen garfish, too, at times.
The beakics won’t do business when in travelling
order, but may do so when sporting with merry
immature sea and sand mullet on the sand and mud-
.fiats of tidal lakes and estuaries. From rock-clefts
you may draw small red rock-cod, heavily armatured
with spines, like their the deadly fortescue-
fish. These gaudy fish fight hard; considering their
weight. Cockatoo fish, dusky-brown in coloring, and
related to the morwong, though not his peer in
point of edibility, dart warily between the kelp, and
as a rule it is easy enough to secure a haul of
small sweep, sprinkled with his yellow-and-brown
strined chum, the mado. The adult sweep does not
enter inside waters. The yellow leather-jacket
(.“Chinaman ’) is common enough, but I have never
seen the handsome orange-spotted fellow in this
though on the South Coast where the
Chinaman” seems uncommon, at any rate in cer-
tain localities, he is a nuisance, and sometimes pans
out 18 inches in length. The green eel also boards
at Balmoral, but is not the plague that he is further
south. At dead-low tide John Chinaman hunts the
savory mutton-fish (clam) by lantern-light, and put
a sausage-machine he makes excellent soup.

N. S. Wales combined High School cham-
pionships at Sydney last week brought out L. Ban-

4-osee.), 220yds. (24sec.) and 440yds. (64<tses —one
sec. better than J. Votes’s figures in 1918). He has an
easy long-striding action and leaves distance behind
in a style that makes watch-holders blink. R. Har-
bison (East Maitland) won senior high-jump (sft
tim.) and pole vault (10ft. 4in.), and was second in
120yds. hurdles to school-mate A. Bailey. Among
the juniors the Maitland boys shone brightest, (f
McDonald won the 100yds. (11 3-f>sec.), B. Erape
took the 440yds. (56sec. —- equals record), K. Ander-
son landed the pole vault (Bft. din.), and U. Kobin-
son won the high-jump (6ft. .'Usee.—2.|see. above
the previous figures). For the championships, North
Sydney (26 points) took the senior title from East
Maitland (17 points); in the junior East Maitland
(13 points) won from Sydney High (11 points).
W. Sheehan well-nigh cleaned up tlve
seniors programme at the King’s School (Parra-

He is a good aii-round sport and last year was in
Combined G.P.S. v. Sydney ’Varsity at both football
and cricket.

According to a Sydney Sun cable, “a
golling sensation has been caused by the failure of
Phe Bit Three, James Braid, J. H. Taylor and
Harry Vardon, to qualify for the final of ‘the pro-
fessional tournament at Walton Heath.” Taylor
was open champion for the first time in 1894. He
won the title at Sandwich—the St. Andrew’s of
England. Vardon took it from him, after a tie, in
96, and Taylor beat Vardon in 1900. From that
day to this, witli a few exceptions (the Frenchman
Arrnand Massy was the winner in 1907), one of
the three lias always been on top. Taylor is the
world s greatest putter; Vardon’s strong point is
straight driving; and Braid is greatest in approach.
Their likeliest rivals in the pro. ranks are Jean
Gassiat, a French, youngster who has beaten Massv
several times; Abe Mitchell ; and George Gadd, of
Roehampton. It was at Walton Heath, by the
way, that Braid did the longest drive on record under
normal conditions, namely, 395 yards.
The 10-miles cross-country championship
of vie. at Caulfield last Saturday provided the most
open. race since the event was introduced over 20
years ago. The knowing ones reckoned Tom Vines
pretty well a cert., with much-improved “Jock”
Parker as the man to upset the apple-cart. The cart
was upset by A. E. McMillan, of St. Stephen’s
Harriers, who won by some 80yds. from Parker,
with Nicholls third and the fancy Vines fourth, the
clocks ticking off 60min. 20secs. for the journey.
The course, a new one, direct south from the south
gate of the Caulfield Racecourse, is the easiest trip
that runners in this contest have ever made. Veteran
George Blake, the brilliant Melbourne harrier who
won the “ten” 19 years ago, stripped for an airing
and arrived home 35th without turning a hair. Over
a heavier and more difficult course Blake did the 10
miles m 3min. faster than Saturday’s race. In the
teams race Carlton pipped the Saints.
Vines failed to reproduce ; anything like his old-
time form. In 1912 he won the big race in 58min.
3sec. over a more difficult course. Again in 1913 he
won in 58min. 23Jsec. And he was second when
Dave Turnbull won in ’ll. His mother’s people have
produced some fine peds. A. A. Nicholls, former
100, 220 and 440 yards charmpion, is a cousin.

Barney Thompson, who put tip a great
scrap against Tommy Uren on his last visit to
tailed miserably against the champion
at Sydney Stadium last Saturday night. Not that
bren shaped attractively. He has rarely given
such a futile exhibition. It was simply a matter
of the Victorian being infinitely worse. After 10
rounds of unscientific scuffling 'the referee put the
audience out of its boredom by handing the palm to
Thomas.

The social sensation of the week was the
blackballing of a well-known young returned
soldier by members of a leading club. Valor,
duty to one’s country and useful citizenship
are of no avail against the ramparts of snob-
bery and club fogeyism.
Said that two impetuous young people
who got hurriedly divorced are repenting at
leisure and preparing to be re-married as
soon as lie returns. If the story is right it
will enable the young wife to get one of
the new-fashioned wedding-rings.
A red-haired beauty of Warrnambool dis-
tinct, who used to be one of our smartest
Cup dressers, has just returned from foreign
lands, and is preparing for this year’s race
festival. Since Melbourne saw her last she
has been engaged, married and divorced.
Rear-Admiral Ticked, who died suddenly
on Friday, was formerly one of the white-
haired boys of the Vic. Defence Department.
There was a certain rivalry, healthy rivalry,
between him and his fellow naval trainee,
Colquhoun. Generally they kept step. Just
before his death, some years ago, Colquhoun,
who had then the rank of commander,
showed signs of forging ahead. Iload, who
rose to be a major-general and a knight,
was the third pet of the Department. Tic-
kell (who, by the way, was born on board
ship at Amoy, China) was in charge of the
small contingent sent north 19 years ago
at the time of the Boxer rebellion ; but he
will be best remembered as Director of Nnvai
Auxiliary Services during the Great War,
Though it brought him no limelight, he got
two steps—commodore and rear-admiral—
within three years. Loss of his son in the
Waratah helped to age him. He was only
02.
Hart, the new JDean of Melbourne, is
welcome at the best Anglican tea-tables.
He put in some of his curate work at Christ
Church, South Yarra, the most fashionable
of Melbourne suburban churches. At that
stage he was a not-too-young curate, having
taken his University degrees before he “read
for the Church.” While at Christ Church
he married the daughter of wealthy Buck-
hurst. The Buckhur&t home boasted a large
fountain and pond in its front garden.
While bridegroom Hart was waiting for his
bride to change into her going-away frock
he put in the time frolicking with some
small-child guests. During the romp he fed
into the pond and had to her fished out and
dressed in emergency clothes for the wed-
ding journey. He eventually “went away”
in pants too long, coat-sleeves too short and
a collar that folded round his neck. South
Yarra has never forgotten it.
Ex-superintendent John Sadder has col-
lected the last of: his pension ; 'he had drawn
it for close upon 23 years. Coming from
Tipperary in 1852, he became a police cadet
on December 1 in that year,; and stuck to
the uniform until Dec., 189(5. His most-
mentioned achievement was /in helping to
wipe out the Kelly gang at Glenrowan. lie
has left a book of “Recollections,” published
in 1913. At that date there were but three
other of the old rather swanky cadets left.
One of these, E. W. Fosbery, died some
months ago, and probably John Sadder was
the last of the corps.
E. Mason Cox turned up on the Block
during the month. He had deserted it for
nearly 12 years—most <jf the time spent
in the Argentine ; two of the war years in
hospital. Now he has g6ne into St. Wini-
fred’s for another operation. As he is still
a bachelor bouquets are allowable.
Colonel and Mrs. Wheatley have arrived
from London in time for the Cup Whirl.
They will shelter temporarily with the lady’s
mother, Mrs. Charles Fairbairn, who is just
reviving her old interest in frocks and frivols
after an operation. Colonel Wheatley and
his monocle once adorned Governor Fuller’s
staff, and rumor asserts that he may take
another gent.-help job here.
The eldest hope of the family, Major
Osborne Fairbairn, will also be home for the
races after a stroll round his Bananaland
acreage. Brother Jim is the only absentee:
lie’s in London trying, with Dr. Douglas
Shields’s help, to mend an arm smashed in
an air-raid.
He was complaining at a tea-room table
surrounded by seven more or less elderly
ladies. “I hate the papers; I loathe the
people who write for them.” “But they give
you a lot of mention!” said a friend. “Yes,
but where? Always in the ‘Lady’s Letter’
or the ‘Woman’s Column’ or ‘Fashion Notes.’
One of these days I’m going to start a libel
action against the paper that sandwiches
me between a birth notice and a beauty
bath !” And then he took a puff from one
lady’s bag and powdered his indignant nose.
Vivienne Dudgeon, a youthful daughter of
John Dudgeon, of Brighton, is home again
trom Cairo after a useful performance at
the Australian Soldiers’ Club, started in
3017 by the Church of England. The young
V.A.D., who had previously done Red Cross
kitchen-work in Melbourne, showed such a
head for affairs that she was given the club’s
house-keeping to see to.
The old Skene station, at Hamilton, for
long held by the pioneering Robertsons, has
changed owners. The seller was James
Robertson, now settled at Coolabali, Pens-
hurst. Skene goes into the hands of the
Philip family, various members of which are
distributed over many fat acres in the merino
country.
Medical Major Mildred Carlile, who has
been doing locum-tenens work since shed-
ding, his Anzac khaki, is going into practice
at picturesque Belgrave.
Oliver Bainbridge, who is stirring up the
intellectuals with his wander-lectures, is the
weird young man with busted boots and long
hair who turned up 10 years ago or more in
Victorian country towns and bailed up
mayors and so forth to attest his last con-
sumption of miles. He had walked 10,000
leagues more or less when he reached Bairns-
dale, and when he told the staring Gipps-
landers they merely said, “Struth! Ain’t yer
feet sore ?”
Lorna Stirling is fiddling her way into the
front row of Australian musicians. A Haw-
thorn girl with ability and temperament,
she put the crust of
scholarship on her
training by listening
carefully to Felix
Gade and serving
a three-years’ exhi-
bition at the Unij
Conserva torium.
Then she headed for
her diploma under
Carmen Delprat, and
reached the objec-
tive with first-class
honors in 1917. She
has since figured
prominently in
Chamber Music,
notably sonata work,
and has also joined
Gustave Walther for
a tour through the
classics. A competent pianist as well as
violinist, she has made the piano play a big
part in the Workers’ Educational Assoc.
During the war her vacations were crammed
with charitable engagements, and, as a mem-
ber of the popular Berry Bank Party, she
skimmed the cream of the Western district
for patriotic funds. The accompanying
photo is Rembrandt’s.
Beautiful Sassafras held Billy H„ughes for
an hour or two the other Saturday. But
the place didn’t know it till he had gone,
because he came in a motor for a breath of
air and the dust of his going was whirling
up before anyone could recognise him and
demand a speech. He drove through the
Sassafras Soldiers’ Avenue, which is an im-
posing double line of trees, three-quarters
of a mile long, on the crown of a high hill —
a large performance for a small mountain
village. The first tree planted was a war-
nurse’s memorial.
Edinburgh University is compiling a war
record and honor roll of all graduates who
served or died. It will be published early
in 1920. A call goes out across the world
to the many whose present addresses are not
known to send full particulars of units,
service, honors, etc., to Edinburgh.
One of our country drapers at any rate
is quite frank about it:—
Remember Wednesday is the last opportunity of
securing real value for your money. Final reduc-
tions at Blanks: ladies’ smart trimmed hats which
were 255. going for 9s. lid.
Adelaide sends her notebook :
The Munro Ferguson visit made Government House
as busy as a restaurant. Dinners on Tuesday, Wednes-
day and Thursday—the Wednesday one for tabbies,
with Lady Helen as hostess—a reception and investi-
ture on Friday evening, and a presentation of decora-
tions on Saturday. On Wednesday her Ex. was en-
tertained by the Victoria League while her husband
went to look at Kuitpo Forest. On Thursday she
opened a fair in the Town Hall in aid of the Presby-
terian Inland Mission. Friday’s reception was a full-
dress affair. Lady Helen wore a trailing frock of
rose chiffon brocade and a bushel of jewels. On
Thursday there was a brief visit to the Town Hall.
Dances are less frequent, but the week brought a
mayoral festivity in the St. Peter’s Town Hall, a
children’s ball in aid of the free kindergartens, and
a dance with Mrs. Alfred Wigg as hostess.
The Botanic Gardens possess a new bush-house. It
is a gift from Mrs. A. M. Simpson and her daughter
in memory of the late A. M. Simpson, who was a
member of the Board for over 20 years and a good
Australian for twice as long.
Mrs. Robert Harper and Miss Kate Gardner, both
from Melbourne, are staying at the Queen Adelaide
Club. Mrs. Harper has come over to attend a niece’s
wedding this month.
Mrs. Morey and her second son returned last week
after being in England nearly six years. She left
here when elder son Allan won a Rhodes Scholarship.
War broke out soon after he reached Oxford, and
after doing brilliant work with the infantry and in
the air he was killed.
Rose Macpherson and Gladys Reynell have an in-
teresting show of pictures and pottery at Preece’s
gallery. The pictures are all their own work and
so is half of the pottery; the rest was done by nerve
and shell-shock patients under their supervision in
the pottery they established at the Seale-Hayne Mili-
tary Hospital in Devonshire. The Governor opened
the exhibition and gave the two women responsible
for it extra cheers for their practical and far-sighted
work for nerve-racked men.
Adelaide tram fares are to go up again, but only
on Sundays and holidays this time, to meet the in-
creased pay of drivers and conductors, The mini-
mum fare on these days is to be 2fd., and racegoers
to Victoria Park, which is on the city park-lands,
are to pay 4d.
Adelaide City Council has been lent a whole batch
of the effects of Col. Light, who laid out the city
early in 1837. They belong to J. €. Jacob, son
of William Jacob, who was closely associated with
Light, and include a copy of the original plan
for the city and other drawings. The loan may,
it is understood, be turned presently into a valuable
gift.
We are at last to have a permanent isolation hos-
pital. The Exhibition has been used during the
’flu epidemic, but that got in the way of lots of
other things. Still, economy being called for, we
are to make shift with the so-called Old Exhibi-
tion between the Adelaide Hospital and the Zoo.
The popular “Goodie” Harris, a Western
district squatter and horse-owner, is shortly
handing his daughter Myrtle into the cus-
tody of Paul Pincus. The young 'man, whose
honors are revealed in a swarm of ■capitals
on a dentist’s plate, handles a pen which has
sparkled in The Bulletin now and again.
Melbourne is temporarily deprived of its
municipal concerts, an operation having left
Dr. Price, the Town Hall organist, in a
private hospital at Oakleigh. The trouble
was induced by the grind at an instrument
the size of a public building and almost
as hard to manipulate, but the mischief has
been satisfactorily overcome with the aid
of the knife, and it only remains for the
popular musician to beat back to normal
health in the course of the next three or
four weeks. He is already well on the way.
A number of nurses from Melbourne —
about 70 of them —tripped across the
Straits lately, expecting to find stacks of
private employment in Tasmania. Thirty
found themselves in Hobart with nothing
to do, and have been besieging the Govern-
ment for expenses incurred on the journey,
alleging that there was an implied promise
and a more or less definite Government
invitation extended to them by telegram.
Health Department officials say that the
nurses entirelv misunderstood the alleged in-
vitation ; but as there was a bungle some-
where, the island authorities will probably
temper red tape with generosity and pay.
Captain Dyett (photo by Humphrey) is
the president of the Returned Soldiers and
Sailors’ I m ]3 e r i n 1
League of Australia,
and lie won the
post by disinterested
enthusiasm and
sagacity. Open-faced,
frank and boyish, he
is the official voice of
aggrieved Diggerdom,
but he doubles the
effect of an appeal
or a protest by the
influence of a like-
able personality. As
recruiting-officer in
the da£s when the
flow of manhood was
expii’ing in a dribble
of youths and veter-
ans, Dyett induced
many a waverer
into khaki by the prestige of his character
as a dinkum warrior and sport. _ He had
impressed his superiors by his example on
Gallipoli, doing great work in exposed
positions; and though he missed a decora-
tion (which is another story), the Diggers
know his worth, and lie can have no greater
reward than their confidence.
Emily Dyason at the piano and Leila
Doubleday with her violin drew a crowd
to the Lyceum Club the other evening. A
sonata new to Melbourne was duetted by
the clevgr girls. It was by Gabriel Faure.
They also “did” Schumann’s No. 2 Sonata
in D Minor. The Club rallies for another
recital in September. Itita Hope will be
the star.
Just as the art lovers and Philistines who
were taking stock of the paintings of Max
Meldrum and his pupils were about to empty
the temporary gallery in the Athenaeum Hall
the other afternoon, Archbishop Mannix,
after climbing the staircase at a rapid rate,
stepped in and sat down quietly in front of
his own portrait, which is the feature of the
collection. Meldrum greeted Dr. Mannix and
the middle-aged cleric who accompanied him.
The other visitors forgot their hurry, the
hall-keeper borrowed a fresh supply of
patience, and the closing time was post-
poned. For comparing the portrait with the
original the opportunity was rare, and the
visitors availed themselves of it. There was
a unanimous verdict for Meldrum.
The Best People who like motionless pic-
tures are running up to the show of paint-
ings by Mary Allen in the Fine Arts (Gal-
lery. Mary is the graceful daughter of Pro-
fessor Allen, and Fox recorded her on can-
vas in the days gone by. She has a nice
turn for portraiture, and her easel is placed
in the Dudley Building, where several
famous Australians used to roost high.
Under July dates' Fayette Perry post-
carded many Australian acquaintances from
one of the Rhine towns, explaining that she
was still engaged entertaining garrisons of
Americans among the armies of occupation.
Wears a uniform, she does, and an American
Army Service Star.
The late Wallace Brownlow was pursued
persistently by autograph-hunters after he
had become a pub-keeper in Westralia.
Many collectors went to the trouble of mail-
ing their pretty books to him. Brownlow
allowed some such appeals to remain un-
answered for a few months. Then he spent
one Sabbath morning replying. Did it prac-
tically, too. Using his pub’s letterheads he
wrote the tariff for board and lodging thereat,
adding his name and the description “Bung
(but far from Broke!).”
E. J. Roberts, one of the Firm’s musical
directors, made a life contract with Olive
Godwin in Sydney on Tuesday. The lime-
light man was not asked to the wedding, and
there was a quiet little morning ten at
the Hotel Carlton afterwards. Amongst the
sippers were Hugh Ward, Andrew MacCunn.
J. W. Ilazlitt and pianist Frank Hutchings.
The clever Olive is a Dubbo (N.S.W.) girl,
and the musical ’groom is English.
Gertrude Johnson, the young Melbourne
singer who is Australia’s Lucia, has a
piquant manner and mischievous eyes. She
takes her success modestly, and declares she
hasn’t copied real lunatics. “I’ve always
been a bit mad, and grandfather was an
actor,” is how she accounts for herself. She
is an only child, kept hard at the piano
until she was 17, and then switched off t:o
singing. 'Only 23, America, in the near
future, with London to follow. Edison
wants some records of her top notes, and has
ordered them.
The 38SO “bustle” achieves further emi-
nence in “Old Lady 31,” at the King’s. Eily
Malyon is almost overbalanced by the bounc-
ing brown balcony behind. Sara Allgood in
a coldish cornflower-blue is less ceremoni-
ously decorated, but Katie Towers, blooming
in pale biscuit shades for her long-deferred
marriage with her crumpled mariner-, is three
times round the post office about the hip
level. Elsie Parkes, the pretty sister of
Lizette, whom she follows on the path of
elocution, causes most, excitement in the
wardrobe department. Her first entrance is
in a brown riding-habit, smart boots and
hat, and she has another happy moment later
on in nifty pink with panniers providing
battlements all round.
“Camouflaging the nation with tea-parties.
Sack the lot!” Thus, explosively, Lord
Fisher last week, in reference to the recent
social offensive conducted by the battle-
cruisers of the R.N. against the S.W. ports
of England. The social touch has always
been a feature of the Australian station;
full-dress balls and dinners being the order
rather than mere teas. And now even the
Lower Deck —whose sole privilege, in the old
days, was to “stand and wait” —is being
catered for by means of dances at which
their lady relatives and friends are eligible
to turn up. Irhagine the tumultuous feel-
ings of furious old “Jacky” when he gets to
hear about it!
Wonder whether the big stores do get any -
thing much out of their mannequin parades?
Of course they provide a free matinde per-
formance for Mrs: Subbubs, who flocks in by
the hundred, and remarks upon the living
models as though they were show girls :
“The one in the pink golfer’s got nice ankles
—pity she sticks her head out that goosey
way”; and so on. Then there’s the queen
of the mannequins, who wears the most ex-
pensive frocks and chatters to the gaping
crowd while it runs a calculating eye oyer
her IS-guinea model with a view to copying
it in voile at a cost of fl 9s. At one
parade this season the crush of women was
so great that the management had to threaten
dreadful things to stem the scramble for the
front seats.,

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Music by wireless was the “special” of the
Bihous Club dinner to the Jocooks and odd
bits of the Navy on Friday evening at
L l le masic was wirelessed from
S^ en^ Str t e \, alld was somewhat indis-
tinct, though the passage from “Pinafore”
came out in fine style :
Stick close to your desks, and never go to sea,
And you all may be rulers of the King’s Navee.
Dumaresq bagged a silver cup on behalf of
the floating population, a lady fainted, and
Cook told how he beat Tirpitz,
TnShnS U<L, # <; T miXtU ?. e tlmt Calls itself the
institute of Journalists welcomed Prime
.mister Hughes and War-corresfoondent
larry Gullett at the one lunch. Hughes
was in good spirits and a grey suit, and
apparently still draws his sustenance from
m i air - I . i 4 fter President Heney had called
the big little man all sorts of names and the
111 and iitzgerald had woven his diap.et
of words, William the Conqueror told how
he piloted the Peace Conference through the
seas of discussion to the signing of the Peace
1 reaty.
Charley Bean, who has lost the exalted
look he wore when he was first home—the
look that made you feel the Archangel
Michael was doffing his halo when young
nery-locks lifted his lid to you—put in a
word for Harry Gullett; a glowing word,
too. And when Gullett made his speech
about the Light Horse in Palestine, you
looked from “Charley” to “Harry” and were
glad that these men are to tell the story
of the world’s youngest army. There will
be something in the Digger annals that no
other history has had, that perhaps no
future history will have; for these two are
brothers in youth and spirit to the Digger,
big with the understanding that can reach
out and grasp the significance that even
“Dead Sea Dora” had for the fighting lads.
The outstanding features of the dance on
the Australia last week were Host
Dumaresq’s top-coat and really-and-truly
sandwiches after a breadless day. The
Commodore, evidently deep in the throes of
a chill, stuck to his coat all the evening,
though the bare sex floated all around with
undressed backs. Add to a mild September
night a perfectly waxed and awninged deck,
two bands (one to play the programmed
dance, the second to take up the encore
number which dancers always insist on
now), strings of lanterns and rows of elec-
tric bulbs, the Navy for partner (with one
solitary khaki suit), and you get the back-
ground for the flock of persistent jazzers
In the tally were the little dark Coghlan
g u’ tH 1 * 3 McMllla n bud in pale blue brocade,
the Moreau girls, Mrs. Leslie Stuart, and
Mrs. Venour Nathan with sleeked-up head
and lavender draperies. Woman’s-move-
ment Mrs. Herring and the anti-Wagner
Hughes lady smiled upon the party Lights
went out at 12 o’clock, but there were no
Cmderellas at that ball.
i i l ' was given the home-
baked crust of welcome by the Women
Painters on Thursday. President Mrs. Holman
in blue and white stripes and an Armistice-
Day tickler rearing itself from the brim ot-
her hat, cooed the dovecote’s appreciation of
the works of art which Mr. Leblanc had
introduced to us from the pen and brush of
Bie soidier artists of France. Leblanc,
white-haired and very lean and nervous, and
very attractive in his simple sincerity, re-
iiieciiin the language that is understood of
all the world—-the language of the heart.
Iso greater study in contrasts could be
ToKin than a shm ’ impetuous, enthusiastic
Leblanc and squarely-built, slow-speaking

contrasts that France found her great

Brigadier-General L. C. Wilson n«in
and many other things, left AustraHa in
W-14 with the Fifth
Wffht Horse, and
after seven months’
service on the Pen-
insula commanded
the rearguard of the
Second Light Horse
at the Evacuation.
Then, after an inter-
val, came the fight-
ing that culminated
in the battles of
Romani, Ivatia and
Bir-el-Abd in
August, the advance
across the desert,
the first and second
battles of Gaza and
the operations
around Wadi Guzze
till Genera] Allenby
took the offensive in October, 1917. At this
s t a f. e Generll Wilson was given command
of the Third Light Horse Brigade, and with
it lie took part in the attack on Beersheba
was in at the capture of Jerusalem, and
in due time swept on through Nazareth to
the taking of the city of Tiberius on the
oea of Galilee. With the subsequent cap-
ture of Damascus the Turkish resistance
practically ended. In civil life the General
is a solicitor with a practice in Brisbane
and a proprietary interest in the Motor
in Australia magazine.
Lady Davidson will say “Thank you” to
the members of the Red Cross Sewing Guild
on October 14. An address to the Mayoress
from the Guild is also on the programme.
Part of-the wealth and a section of the
beauty of Darling Point rolled up to a ladies’
tennis tournament last week in aid of the
Sydney Hospital linen fund. Dr. Harris
Mrs Street and Mrs. Cohen lent their courts,
and Mrs. Cohen divided the prize with Miss
Rosalie Collins.
Ihe old Fresh Food and Ice rooms have
changed their name to the Marlborough.
Redecorated and overhauled, the King-
street restaurant pushes in among the swank
meeting-places. To-day the first jazz tea
gets under weigh, and tables have been en-
gaged by all the futurist fashion-plates, the
Buster Browns, and the right-up-to-the-
minute maid and matron. Miss Gertrude
Rennie, who has worked the transformation
in the rooms, is one of two Melbourne sisters
who were money-spinners for the soldiers
and sailors during the war. Pity the estab-
lishment couldn’t have run to a dinkum
Aussie christening.
Alicia Nolan, now Mrs. Baulman, has
been down from the Maclean to hear how
the Grand Opera starlings compare with
her old friends Marie Narelle and Kate
Rooney. Alicia at the piano was always
a favorite feature of the concerts given hy
those two popular songbirds.
At the Wentworth on the evening of the
naval party on the Australia, the Army ran
a counter-attraction. Returned A.1.P.-ers
had sent out the cards, and found lots of
pretty girls true to the khaki. The Mortons
and Rolins and Doreen Hordern were in this
basket of buds.
This is Roy Agnew. the young composer-,
who is giving a recital on October 21, when
the first half of the
programme will con-
sist of things, writ-
ten by himself. Roy
is a brilliant pianist,
and he hopes by a
series of recitals to
make sufficient
money to take him
to America and Lon-
don and get the
judgment of other-
world audiences on
hi:) compositions. A
pupil of de Beau-
puis, it was that fine
teacher who' set the
simile to the fires of
ambition and en-
thusiasm with
which the young
man is now aglow. Sydney has never yet
refused to help young ambition, so Roy
comes to his public with a certain confidence.
French Australian Leaguer Miss Gurney
is off by the Orsova to link up with Miss
Soubeiran, and last week the Carlton
drawing-room spread a tea-table round which
farewell and good-luck were said. Marie
Segur supplied the music of the afternoon,
and there was a special posy of welcome for
Mrs. G. Playoust.
At the Catholic Women’s Association
rooms Helen Barlow was welcbmed by the
3rd Battalion Comforts girls with song and
tea and sweet-smelling garden-stuff. Helen
was secretary till she went, three years ago,

Arthur Leplastrier and his wife have, on
their latest trip to Europe, taken daughter
Ruth to show what sort of complexion

The Aaron Blashkis (Sydney takes off its
hat to them for their good works) had a
wedding last week, when doctor and soldier-
son Eric claimed Olive Gordon in the
presence of Rabbi Cohen at the Great Syna-
gogue. Olive, who is the daughter of' the
L. Gordons of Darling Point, wore lots of
ostrich-feather trimming on her white'satin
and tulie gown, while bridesmaids Ray,
Gordon and Viva Blashki wore frocks of
biuey-green georgette. The wedding cake was
surrounded by a trail of maiden-hair fern
and banked by vases of stock and sweet
peas at the Carlton.

business with “the East”; and his eldest son
became as much at home there as in his
native Australia. He went from the Philip-

What’s a Name Worth ?
Just recently we were building a
saddle for a man, and he» was most
particular that we should stamp our
name on it. “You know,” said he,
“a saddle with ‘Walther & Stevenson’
stamped on it is worth a quid or two
extra when a man wants to sell.”
The “LONGREACH” is one of the
many Saddles making
this reputation for us.
It is comfortable from the moment you sit
in it—-note how the flap is sewn direct on to
the seat, doing away with the usual skirt
and giving a comfortable, non-chafing narrow
grip. Then note how the pads are set high
up along the rider’s thighs, giving perfect
security. It is made in nice flexible kip
leather and the tree is- our best “Fouright”
steel-plated. Fitted with folded girth,
bevelled leathers and solid nickel stirrups.

unless stamps accompany.
Hetty: She “held down a position.” Why
that stupid, superfluous “down” ?... . J.S.N.: Very
nearly... .H.O. A.: Thanks; but it would require to
be re-written.... Bill A.: It’s a champion all right;
and so is he.... Cleon: “From the Stars there comes
no answer.” Well, try those at the Tivoli or Fullers’.
Nothing reticent about them.... Gibb: Deserves a
place in the line :—-
Trooper, sapper, flying-corps so dapper;
An Aussie with a stretcher, or an Anzac with a gun;
Driver, runner, bombardier or gunner—
Cut the stripes and cut the stars, but pick out the
Rising Sun!
. ..J.L.: (1) Got the letter, but not the par. If
you are “pursuing literary . studies” and want to
write for the paper, what’s all the secrecy about?
Send the literary studies along in the ordinary way.
... .H.R.McD.: “Brown’s Musical Instrument” is out
of tune. Poor batch generally.... Aneb: Don’t
know, but maybe your kick settled it....
M.E.W.: Misses.... Dale C.: You had a subject
there... .L.L.: Quite unworthy of the bush-
kid subject. But it wants doing—badly....
Thomas S. B.: You’re working off Masefield —“All
I want is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.”
. ...E.J.8.: “Those Old Shipmates of Mine” were
a good lot, but you haven’t given them a fair deal.
....Clare W.: The only line that had interest read:
“Blanking you in anticipation.”... .Adelaide: Don’t
know what she’s bringing for baby ; but it can’t be
delivered here... .L.G.R.: “In the Firelight.” Cor-
rect.... Bill Digges: Much too prolific... .V. 8.:
(Tafl.) : No. .. .G.E.M.: “Romance” is dead....
Ex-Gun. 6157: You are not entitled to the 1914-15
ribbon unless your ship reached Egypt by Dec. 31,
1915. .. .Gadfly: Rather machine-made... .N.E.H.:
Doesn’t make a yarn... .Lord Toothpick: Thin stuff.
. ...C.11.: Your complaint seems to be that the
visiting Englishman doesn’t speak the cheap
American slang of the picture-shows. .. .C.11.D.:
Yarns badly handled. .. .Chanco: Well enough
done, but .not 'What we’re looking f0r....
E.J.U.: The spitting Norwegian doesn't fascinate
us..'.H.T. (Malvern): “Surrender” misses.. .8.5. M.:
That ground has had too many crops taken off it.
....J.P.K.: Yarn doesn’t convince... .Hannibal:
Very poor sonnets.... Keynote: Too much common-
place there... .E.C.C.: An old theme better worked
by others. “Our Dreams” doesn’t suit... .L.A.L.:
Haven’t a notion what it means.... A.C.C.: Seems
to be insane F.V.E.: “Hy Brasil” has feeling.
Now get to work on the crude lines... .V.B. (Tas.) :
Misses, but not by much.... Nemesis: The verse is
very rough and lumpy. What’s the use of trying
us with anything but your best ?... .8.D.:
(Calliope): “The Lagoon” runs dry too soon
L.C.R.: Doesn’t move us... .Kemo: Bolshevik
verse poorly handled.... G.G.D.: The baby song
is only fair... .P.T.F.: Doesn’t quite do it....
D.P.M.: Too like too many other yarns. ... Noctiluca:
Not well enough done Vlidon: Melodrama....
Stylus: Who talks about “shuck” and “stiff as a
baseball bat” in Australia? Touburke: Not up.
...T.C. (Lindfield) : Not for u5...A.L.8.: Don’t like
the revised version any better. .. .Harold T.:
“Poverty” contains a good idea, but that refrain is
like the burbling of the male turkey.... A.E.Y.:
Not up. ...8.A.M.: The verse you send doesn’t sug-
gest that you have found a genius... .J.A.V.S".:
Not nearly enough in it. .. .T.H.M.: Stiff verse,
which, viewing the facts, seems ridiculous. .. . W.W.:
(Wyalong) : Doesn’t say anything. .. .Buster: Some
girls of 14 could do better. After the seventh
line you got tired.. ..Ame de B.: Feeble little
flutter.... Doreen W.: Lame in all its feet and
entirely without intelligence... .F.L.H.: Doesn’t
strike u 5,... .A.S. : “The Dead Woman” is worth
re-writing. .. .Wheatstone: Don’t like it.... J.L.
’ (BoWral) : Not half-way up. .. .D.L.8.: Very crude,
.... Seedy: Not well enough done, and it was worth
doing... .J.C.S.: Dull stuff... .S.T.S.: Too slight
for its length.... Don B.: Neither decent verse nor
honest prose. .. .E.M.J.: Dawn —noon —night! The
old trio and nothing new to say about any of them.
.... Walnut: All right, say it: —
When a great ship dives suddenly under the waves,
Leaving no trace whatever, and no explanation ;
When all on board find they have watery graves, 1
It requires much serious consideration.
When the fearful news reach their friends safe at
home,
Some resignedly pray and a few become caustic;
The great mental lurch causes brain-power to roam.
They turn out in a few more days frightful
agnostics.
... . J.D.H.R.: “The Yellow Dragon and the Red”
would still be bad verse on a stupid theme if you
added a rainbow dragon to the menagerie. . .Plough:
The good lines in “Scrub Fallers” deserve better
company that you make them keep.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
8.A.F.: The lady has claws instead of hands. You
didn’t set out to draw a vampire, did you ?. .. .
A.K.R.: Tell your friend to study and draw larger.
. ...B.B.: Yes, there is some promise there....
J.R.S.: Scratches only.... Mark McA.: In the nur-
sery division Wog: Send the drawing to the ci-e-
-matorium instead... .S.H.: Two wooden men. Chop
them up for next winter.... T.P.: You’d better re-
sign yourself to a long course of study... .G. 8.:
Your chariot rolls 0ut....D0c: Never draw a fire
with a blue pencil. Blue is cold. .. .Roy M.: Decent
beginner’s stuff P. J.D.: Very gloomy art
C.S.M.: You have too much faith in Chinese white.
Improve your drawing a lot.
“Aunt Maria” : Another instance of the
inequality of the sexes! It is advertised
that in the “Ba'tle of Flowers” pageant,
shortly to be held at Sydney Show Ground,
there is to be a “Night of Mad Joy,” dur-
ing which “5000 girls in floral costumes
will, at a given signal, charge upon the
crowd Rings of pretty girls will form
round everyone who looks as if he wants
cheering up, and he will be made to dance
with the rest.” But why cater only for the
entertainment of the males? Surely Mum
and Sister Kate and I should have a share
in the festivities? I appeal to the manage-
ment to hire a battalion of beautiful actors.
Array these heroes and then let them charge
with the five thousand. There are hundreds
of plain suburban women who would cheer-
fully toddle 10 miles and pay double the
entrance fee for a little mad joy. There is
no mad joy in the suburbs —only gas bills
and washing-up.

The crucial test.
No other instrument but The NEW
EDISON is capable of withstanding
such a severely practical test as this:
the comparison of the artist's voice
with the Re-creation of that voice.
Such a test by The NEW EDISON
has been made on numerous occasions
—always with the same result —that
the Re-creation could not be distin-
guished from the original.
ĥ
The NEW EDISON
Re-creates all forms of music
—both vocal and instrumental—and embodies a new art, the
culmination of Edison’s research ivork in chemistry and acoustics.
The Laboratory formulae and methods are known only to
Edison and a few of his trusted assistants. No one assistant knows

Diamonds Never Raised.
We are proud to be able to publish the fact that we never
raised the price of any of our enormous stock of diamond jewellery
during the war period. We objected to profiteering.
Then, too, five weeks before the war started our managing
director was in Antwerp, and he bought diamonds in tens of
thousands at pre-war Cash Prices, and so we could afford to Sell
at normal prices. We think it wiser business to increase customers
b.v giving special values than to make one large profit and lose
them. We, therefore, are selling diamonds at less prices than
those of London.

Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills
Make Weak Backs Strong.
“I feel I must write and tell you
how Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills have
cured me. I was a great sufferer
with my kidneys, and tried a great
many things. At last I thought I
would try Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills,
as my mother swears by them.
After taking one bottle I felt much
improved. I have since taken six
bottles, and 1 can only say I am
cured, and very grateful for it.
You may use this in the paper if
you wish, for I am more than
grateful for the result of taking
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills.

The Haunted House.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
A DULL piano in the night
Had almost bumped my wits astray ,
A phonograph was making quite
As great a noise across the way ,
A woman with a tuneless throat
Was screeching to her highest note.
The air was hot, the stars were dim,
A hooting car went past the gate;
My flower-beds, sedate and trim,
Seemed breathing forth a hymn or hate.
The evening landscape, bored and dull,
Was like dry sawdust in a skull.
I said, “This is no good to me.
Adventure calls across the street.
There must be something there to see;
And I have hands and also feet.
I will go forth and break this spell
Of too familiar sight and smell.’
Across the road there is a gate.
Beyond it weeds are rank and high,
And trees that seem to bear the weight
Of all the sorrows of the sky ;
And there a great house, grey and blind,
Sits on the ground and does not mind.
I said “The mystery of this
Ere midnight comes I must explore.
Rank rose and jacaranda kiss
For ever by the shadowed door.
I owe it to my manly pride
To see if there is aught inside.”
I climbed the gate, I passed the weeds,
I left the roses to the right.
A cobweb, thick with thistle-seeds,
Was dimly spread across the night.
I broke it ere the spider knew
Exactly what to say or do.
I found a window hoar with age
And raised the dusty sasli on high.
A small bat, in a headlong rage
At my appearance, seemed to fly.
And then I saw the ghost uprear,
A slender, pallid form of fear.
I said “Good evening” to the shade;
And struck a sudden match" to see
If it were miser, monk or maid,
This spook that trembled close to me.
“Good evening,” she replied. The flare
Shone for a moment on her hair.
I saw her shrink. “Hold on a bit,”
I whispered. “Do not run away.
The stars are out, the street lamps lit;
I have a lot I want to say
To your sweet ghostliness that seems
As delicate as down of dreams.”
I heard the rustle of her dress,
A laugh that butterflies might use
When with a summer-sweet caress
They find the flower their fancies choose.
I struck another match to see;
But still her face eluded me.
She fled. I followed close behind
Through creaking doors and up a stair.
Oh, was it love? And is it blind?
I thought I saw her shining hair.
And then I grasped—oh, thoughts thal
whirl !
Was it a ghost, or just a girl?
My arm about her as she stood,
A third swift match I boldly struck;
And ghost or girl, the sight was good.
I blest my own especial luck.
Here was adventure to my taste;
My happy arm stole round her waist.
She breathed a soft and tender sigh.
“Why did you come so late?” she said.
“The little trees have grown so high.
I have been twenty summers dead.
The house is very lonely, too,
With nothing but dream-things to do.”
“Dear heart,” I said, “I did not know ;
But whisper all you want to say.
Your breath appears to come and go;
You laugh in an undeathlike way ;
And on a happy night like this
I know your lips are good to kiss.”
They were. I felt my senses reel
Just as I touched her laughing mouth.
Four joys at once I seemed to feel.
One each from north, east, west and south
And, though the contact was not loud,
My spirit seemed to be a cloud.
Up. up I mounted, high and far,
Through tremulous spaces blue and wide
I passed the moon, I touched a star —
And then I came back to her side!
Lord, how her soft eyes flashed and shone-
Someone had turned the lights full on !
The stairs "were gone; we stood and gaze
From a high window on the night ;
Her arms with lustrous jewels blazed,
Her little neck was slim and white ;
And she had on a satin dress
Almost too beautiful to press.
I kissed again and yet again
Those lips that seemed to live .and burn
And then she struggled to restrain
My ardor; and a sudden turn
Brought me directly face to face
With a large man who owned the place.
It seemed he owned the girl as well.
A dinner-knrfe was in his hand ;
And. as we two asunder fell,
He waved it with a motion grand.
Then, lunging forward with a cry,
“This is the place,” he said, “you die!”
He struck at me; but that sweet ghost
Rushed in between and caught the blow.
I think that then I loved her most.
I saw her splendid head sink low
And lower. Then I caught the brute
One crashing w’allop with my boot.
He also- died. I stood a10ne....
Then, slow-ly, like a drifting cloud.
Back from the starry spaces blown.
Weeping, my tangled wits I bowed
To ask myself how I got there,
Just half-way up a cobwebbed stair.
Yes I was standing in the dark.
No girl or ghost at all was near.
I left the place with no remark ;
But all my soul was filled with fear.
I rau —l felt I could not wait —
And climbed in haste the rusty gate.
What? Who? When? Whither? Where-
fore? How?
I turned the matter o’er and o er;
I was as puzzled as a cow
That drinks from an artesian bore
The house, the man, the girl—oh, Hell!
And yet I know she kissed me well
I know it, for I tried again.
The selfsame joy, the selfsame woe
Come when I lift the window-pane
And whisper to the ghost I know.
I always see her shining hair
And catch her on the cobwebbed stair.
And now the thought occurs to me
A meat-axe is the thing I need.
The third time that she kisses me
I shall essay the mighty deed.
I having cut the brute in half,
The girl perchance will stay to laugh.
Yes, she will come away and fly
Beyond the dusty, creaking stair;
And I shall see her flashing eye
And watch the sunlight on her hair;
And somewhere down the sweet South Coast
She may forget she is a ghost.

[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
«T DONNO, I donno,” said Coleman
dolorously, “ ’tis a har-r-d tiling for a
mq,n t’ find a wife maybe these times.
I suspect ’twas diff’rent when me pa was a
tall, strappin’ lad, the very like iv meself,
but there don’t seem t’ be no weerain t’ sat-
isfy all requirements left at all.
“I’ve thought a dale iv Annie Ryan lately,
wid an eye to her faults ’n’ unseasonable n
various disadvantages, V meself was well
satisfied consumin’ her mental ’n’ physical
requirements considered ez a wife. Yiv seen
her, have yeh? A tallish gir-r-1 iv madyim
height, wid blue eyes, th’ like iv deep water
be th’ big rocks on any swate day yiv a
mind to; ’n’ a nate figure, bendin this way
’n’ that, an eel might invy; V a wee mite iv
• a hand no bigger ’n’ a rose-leaf in th’ palm,
I’ll wager; ’n’ a foot party ez any lily be
the white moonlight, it lyin’ on th’ green
grass wid no boot to it whatever, n no
stockin’ nayther.
“That would be a likely gir-r-1, you d
think, wid some lamin’ from the school at
Ballarat beyant, ’n’ th’ great understandin’ |
iv cows. So I spoke to ine pa wid some dis-
cretion, ’n’, would yeh believe, he found
faults to her enough to fill a great black
ledger, did he that!
“ ‘Look to ut,’ sez he, ‘ ’n’ think yeh no
more iv a girl ez thin ez a dried lamb-skin,
’n’ wake wid it. She couldn’t lift a boilin’
of poor spuds,’ he sez, ‘ ’n’ her that bad-
favored no boy but th’ gr-reat slobberin’ fool
ye’re th’ like of would give an eye to her
twice in a long month; ’n’ her father pinched
poor, too, wid the bit iv sick land would
grow nothin’ but thistles t’ shtarve a goat.
Have yeh no sinse at all, ’n’ you thirty V
over, t’ be thinkin’ iv th’ like iv her, ’n’
Bungaree that full iv swankin’ red gir-r-ls,
fine chested, ’n’ fat, ’n’ shtrong, wid fathers
solid min ivery one, payin’ th’ inkim-tax,
’n’ sendin’ their sky-high loads iv new hay,
’n’ their many ’n’ many long trucks iv spuds
t’ th’ town year in ’n’ year out?’ ”
Martin Coleman breathed a windy sigh.
“ ’Tis well fer th’ ould man t’ talk iv th’
straight, tall gir-r-ls iv Bungaree go laughin’
by, swingin’ thimselves so to defy a man,
but didn’t I take Mary Quinlan to him, ’n’
Bridget Mitchel to him, ’n’ Kate Fitz-
patrick and Molly Meagher, ’n’ Kate O’Toole,
’n’ many another? And was niver a one
good enough fer Martin Coleman, sou iv
ould Terry Coleman, of Ballaghaderin, fit
wid O’Brien in ’4B!
“Was a gir-r-1 straight ez a saplin, ’n’
handsome wid it, ’n’ kind moreover, she
was become a poor thing ’n’ a cripple ’n’
all, ’n’ ill-favored ez a spud twist wid th’
frost, th’ min-ute I axed me pa.
“So ’tis pretty Annie Ryan I’d die fer.
When me pa has done findin’ faults to her,
me ma comes settin’ me tay, ’n’ pretendin’
casual ’n’ disintherested talk. ‘Annie Ryan
went by th’ day,’ sez she. ‘There's one will
do a har-r-d-workin’ ’n’ provident man no
good,’ she sez; ‘a bit iv a useless thing your
hand could span, ’n’ waltzin. ’n’ thrapsin’,
’n’ twistin’ her impudent eye all th’ long
day t’ catch a lad winkin’. Bad luck t’
th’ like! ’Tis well she’s no daughter iv
mine, ’n’ no niece either, or anythin’ con-
nect wid me at all, at all.’
“Later ’twas me gran’ma would have hit
me wid her crutch. ‘You ould fool!’. sez
she. ‘You ould fool!’ she sez. ’n’ it’s sore
disthressin’, you’ll say, fer a man called an
ould fool be his gran’ma! ‘You ould fool!’
she sez, ‘what’s it I hear you would be took
up wid Ryan’s Anne, her a bit iv a fearful
flighty small gir-r-1 is scarce done twitterin’
th’ way to, school, ’n’ you thirty-two a month
come Chewsdee? Get yeh from me sight,
before I’m breakin’ yer poor impty head
across ’n’ back.’
“Then me tall auntie frim over th’ crick
took an’ abused me all a Sunday, ’n’ me
own Uncle David said I’d git some trifle
of brains maybe be th’ time I was 00, but
’twas no matter he intertained gr-reat hopes
for.
“Would I marry Annie—’n’ she swearin’
her hear-r-t is me own till th’ sun’s self is
gutterin’ in th’ sky like a spent candle—me
pa would disinherit me, ’n’ cast me off wid
a black curse, ’n’ me ma. too. ’n’ me
gran’ma—’n’ she have th’ blackest ’n’ longest
curse iv all. What’s a boy t’ do again’ sich
contrariness ’n’ bitter mischief, d’yeh know?”

BAD BACK!
In these days of high prices it’s poor economy to worry along
with a bad back that makes the simplest work a torture and a full
day s work impossible. If every day brings morning lameness,
sharp pains when bending or lifting, nervousness and a dull, tired
state, there s surely something wrong. Likely it’s kidney weak-
ness. Urinary disorders may give further proof. Don’t neglect
it! Though easily corrected at first, delay may run you into
gravel, dropsy, crippling rheumatism or incurable kidney disease.
Get a bottle of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to-day. They
have helped thousands.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Lasting' Cure of Four
Years.
Mrs. M. Haynes, 77 Rawson Street, Waverley,
Sydney, says:—“Having been cured of backache by
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, some little time ago,
it is with every confidence that I recommend this
remedy to other sufferers. Previous to taking
Doan’s Pills, I was subject to severe pains across
the small of my back, which were very trying when
I moved about much. Dizzy attacks also troubled
me, and I had no energy. One day a friend advised
me to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and, as
before stated, this splendid medicine soon fixed me
up and I have been free of backache ever since. I
need say no more: the facts speak for themselves.”
Four years later, Mrs. Haynes says:—“My cure
has proved a permanent one, no sign of my old
complaint having returned since Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me over four years ago.”
Cured Over Two Years
Ago.
Mr. Thomas Spence, Harriett Villa, Park Road,
Auburn, says:—“For years I was an engine-driver
on the N.S.W. railways, and for a long time prior
to my retirement suffered greatly with my kidneys.
I think the constant exposure had the effect of
weakening these organs. The first warning I had
of anything being wrong was a pain in the small of
my back. This soon began to trouble me a good
deal, and I was often so bad that I could hardly
move. I took medicine of all kinds, but I got no
better, and sometimes I used to wonder if ever I
would be free of the nagging ache. Well, to make
a long story short, I at last got Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and they soon fixed me up, a short
course banishing the ailment completely, and I have
not suffered with my kidneys since.”
Two years later Mr. Spence says:—“l have had
no return of my old complaint since Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills cured me some years ago.”

I did not see Coleman junior again for
seven months or more, and then he took me
by the sleeve, and led me under cover of the
vines.
“A man is wid,” he said, “wid this three
munts ’n’ more. I married wid Annie Ryan,
yill mind me speakin’ of. It come about
mighty quare, through me bein’ a strong man
’n’ one determined, ’n’ a fiery devil when
roused, ’n’ a hayro, too, fer love.
“I’d niver have knowed th’ shtrong, deter-
mined man I was didn’t Annie tell me. How
would I respect meself a hayro or th’ like
iv it till Annie come whisperin’ to me ear?
‘Ye’re a man, Martin,’ she sez, ‘ ’n’ full
grown. Ye’re shtrong ez a horse, ’n’ brave ez
a lion, ’n’ for why wouldn’t yeh show it?
Martin, dar-r-lin,’ she sez, ’n’ her words was
like th’ paradise-bird makin’ hivenly music
to a man, ‘yeh love me wid a big, tearin’
love would kill yeh did I go away ’n’ pine
’n’ die for th’ loss when yer father tears
yeh from me. Martin, lovd iv me hear-r-t,
ye’re th’ makin’ iv a noble hayro, stout ’n’
true, ’n’ willin’ t’ fight t’ th' grave fer a poor
■girl would be sorrowin’ alone, prayin’ th’
saints fer a quick death, you bein’ gone. In
ould Ireland, far ’cross tli’ sea, was many a
fine, brave knight th" like of you broke up!
wouldn’t you do that same, darlin’,
bein’ ez fine, ’n’ grand, ’n’ lian’some a hayro
ez any out of tli’ time iv St. Patrick?’
“Then ’twas I knew I was a hayro. Then
when she told me I knew for meself I was
a shtrong, tall man could hit a mighty
blow would fell a bullock. ’N’ when we was
sittin’ hid be th’ crick one day, ’n’ me father
sent a small boy bid me go home, ‘What will
I do?’ sez I.
“ ‘Tell him you will not,’ sez she. ‘The
hundred acres good land on Spinney’s
Hill is yours, ’n’ th’ buildin’ to it is yours,
n th’ cows. Up ’n’ speak bold like th’
white knights iv th’ days that’s gone, tellin’
him you’ll not stir!’
“Then, knowin’ I was a hayro, ’n’ a man
full grown ’n’ shtrong, too, ‘Tell me pa I’ll
not come, sez I. ‘Moreover,’ I sez, ‘tell
me gran’ma I’ll not come, but will see them
damned first,’ I sez, ‘this dav, to-morrow, or
any day!’
Not five minutes was gone ■when me pa
come in a boilin’ rage would terrify you,
, u , mother come afther, ’n’ me tall auntie,
n mo uncle Dave—a man iv sarcasms ’n’
*" a * ,n ’ a fther all, hobblin’ on her
shtick, me gran’ma come, too.
“ ‘Will ye come t’ me whin I speak ?’ sez
me pa. Th’ roar iv him would stun a bul-
lock. Is me wor-r-d law?’ he sez, cornin’
at me wid a handle to a hoe.
What will I do wid him now?’ sez I
to Annie, not knowin’ how t’ turn him off
from me. 1
;; ‘T’row him in thf crick,’ sez she.
m bein’ a hayro ■ I tuck me own pa, big
Terry Coleman, of Baliaghaderin, fit wid
O Brien in ’4B, ’n’ I t’rew him in th’ crick.
“Then me ma, screamin’ high, ’n’ claws to
her like a wild cat, home at me. ‘ ’N’ what
wtn I do wid me poor ma?’ sez I.
‘ ‘T’row her in th’ crick,’ sez Annie.
“ ’N’ I seized a body holt iv me poor ma,
’n’ I t’rew her in th’ crick.
“Next was me Uncle Dave, a fine man, ’n’
a great talker, I’m tellin’ you; but when he
would say a bitin’ wor-r-d, ‘T’row him in th’
crick !’ sez Annie Ryan, ’n’ I t’rew me fine
Uncle David on his back in th’ clane water,
where _me pa was. ’N’ at Annie’s wrnrd I
t’rew in me tall auntie, ’n’ sore ‘n’ soppin’
wet they all were; while me gran’ma raced
at me, hobblin’ like a witch, ’n’ struck wid
her crutch.
“ ’T’row her in th’ crick!’ sez Annie.
“ ‘But me gran’ma fell down, kickin’ all
th’ turf, ’n’ squealin’ fearful, so we left her
there, ’n’ we left th’ rest pullin’ thimsilves
out iv th’ waters, soaked ’n’ sorrowful, ’n’
we went walkin’ so joyful, me th’ hayro ’n’
Annie th’ gir-r-r-1 one would die for.
“ ’Twas Annie said ‘Now are you th’ finest
man to all Bungaree ’n’ far beyond, ’n’ a

gran’ma would lay her stick ’cross your
head, vou’ll t’row them in th’ tank, or any

“In that frame iv mind I took Annie t’

I’m master in me house on me own land,

“Never one in th’ land will stand against
me this day. Man, ’twas a fine doing when
Annie discovered th’ hayro in me, or maybe
I’d have gone on to all time never guessin’
it, a meek, biddable iad as any in the land.”
Here a commanding voice called “Martin!
Martin ! Where is it ye're hid, ’n’ th’ cows
not home at all?”
“ ’Tis Annie,” said Martin with some con-
cern. “Yill excuse me. I’ll not have to
keep herself waitin’.”
And the hero ran off, calling as he ran:
“Yes, yes, me dar-r-lin’, ain’t I cornin’ this
moment? Ain’t I coinin’ to you quick as I
can this very min-ute?”
EDDYSON.
In the Line.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Signal-Corporal lifted the blanket
hanging at the entrance, and peered
into the reeking dugout. “Wells and
I’erry to go up to O Pip with Mr. Whar-
ton at four!” he said cheerfully.
Perry threw down his cards with a curse,
and borrowed a cigarette from the Bom-
bardier. “It’s a fair cow,” he complained,
“sendin’ a man up to O Pip twice in one
week with these blanky one-star artists.
Larst time I damn near got knocked.”
“It’s a thud, all right,” the Bombardier
agreed.
“By cripes, you’ll get the wind up, Well-
sie,” Perry said,, turning to me. “It’s a
crook possie up there; larst time Fritzie was
droppin’ shells ’round us all the time. Well,
me for a sleep,” he went on, grinning at the
Bombardier. “Those five-nines make' such a
'ell of a noise in the front line a bloke
can’t get any rest. Better ’ave a roost,
Dark.”
He flung himself down on a bunk, and
in a few minutes was sound asleep. Follow-
ing his example, I lay staring for a while
at the misty figures grouped about the
solitary candle, and gradually slipped away
into forgetfulness.
It was light when we started off for the
observation post in the front line—two miles’
heavy going from the battery position.
Perry, an old hand, with a crime-sheet
heavily red-inked, took the lead, Wharton
and I following him with implicit faith
across the maze of half-filled shell-holes,
slimy and dank from recent rains. There
was a charnel-house smell in the heavy air,
and every few yards we stumbled on nose-
caps and dud shells, and once I was sick
after I had trodden on a half-buried German
rotting in the stinking earth. Nothing moved
in this desolation, for the front-line trenches
were just ahead, and I almost choked with
relief as we stepped down into a muddy
communication-trench, and made better
speed forward. We were soon passing
through the infantry holding that part of
the line, many of them inquiring if we’d just
learned there was a war on—a favorite
quip to hurl at artillerymen.
Presently we reached the O Pip dugout—
a staunch affair, with a loophole in the sand-
bags for observation, and an uncomfortable
recess for the field telephone. Kirke, the
officer we were relieving, grinned happily at
Wharton, and related the events of the last
24 hours as lie made rapid preparations to
depart.
“Something doing here yesterday,” he
jerked out. “Put shrapnel on to a moving
target several times during the afternoon—
infantry concentrating, I think. Some of
our scouts are over their lines now trying
to find out wlniffor. There’s a hedge across
there this morning that I didn’t notice yester-
day—might be a new battery. I’d keep an
eye on it. Been very little shelling. Well,
so long—good luck!” and the little partv
moved away.
Perry dropped lazily on a pile of empty
bags, while I buzzed the battery call through.
Wharton was peering through his glasses
at the hedge which Kirke had pointed out;
then he searched carefully the whole of the
sector before him. There was an uneasy
frown on his forehead as he looked down
at me.
“Hand up the ’phone,” he jerked out, and
waited, listening. “Is that you, sir? There’s
a Fritzie battery come in at ak twelve c k
two don. No, they’re quiet, but Kirke said
they were concentrating yesterday. It might
be a hop-over. Will you have a go? All
right, sir. Corrector one-five-oh.”
We waited tensely for his next words.
Then he looked at us and smiled.
‘•We’re going to stir them up.” he said
quietly. “Like to have a look?”
We scrambled to our feet and stood beside
him peering through at the peaceful sunlit
panorama. Then I heard what sounded like
a smothered cough in the receiver pressed
to Wharton's ear, and almost simultaneously
there was a flash and a sudden cloud of dust
three-quarters of a mile in front of us.
“Our number one.” whispered Perry to me.
“Up 300,’.’ said Wharton to the battery!
Another cough, and the burst was a little
further away.
“Down 100,” lie ordered.'
We watched with pounding hearts. This
time the burst was fairly on the dark green
of the hedge concealing the German guns,
and Wharton almost yelled as he spoke the
words: “OK. Register !”
The battery had found its target.
* * * *
a
Five hours later the sector in front of our
shelter was alive with grey, stumbling figures,
while behind them a line of fierce . flashes
showed where the shells that now lashed
about us were coming from. Wharton, pale
and hoarse, was rapping out staccato orders
to Perry, who repeated them to our frantic
battery. We were unhurt, although a few
yards away a heap of earth and shattered
bodies told where a shell had lately burst.
“Thank God !” exclaimed Wharton, as the
line wavered and fell back —“they've chucked
it.”
“Just as well, sir,” replied Perry grimly;
“the line’s gone ‘phut.’ It's a wonder they
haven’t cut it before.”
“Well, we've got to mend it.” said Whar-
ton, sinking down on the ground and wiping
his face with a grimy sleeve.
I started to my feet, but Perry pushed the
telephone towards me and snatched the pliers
from my belt.
“I laid the blanky line,” he said, “and
I’m the bloke to mend it. So long,” and he
was gone.
Wharton rose to his feet gnd peered
through the loophole, while simultaneously
the lluns’ bombardment recommenced as
their attacking parties again left the shelter
of the trenches. The area where Perry must
by now be crawling, trailing the dead, muddy
wire, w'as being plastered with shells. I sat
with the lifeless receiver to my eais for
what seemed hours. A shell dropped amongst
the debris of its predecessor and exploded
harmlessly. Then I shouted to Wharton
as a clear voice came over the line:
“Listen, Wellsie. I gotta bit of a knock—
you’re through to the battery. I’ll stop
here”
The impatient voice of the battery com-
mander broke in as I passed the handpiece
to Wharton, already shouting fire directions,
while the grey, stumbling masses crept closer
and closer to our position.
Wharton received the Military Cross for
keeping communications under heavy fire.
We found Perry next morning lying by the
neatly-joined . wire of the 0 Pip line. He
was dead.
