SATURDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1886.
A Word to the Australian Democracy.
“ Brisbane, Queensland, 15th September, 1886.
“ The Editor Bulletin. Sir,—Being a regular purchaser
of The Bulletin, and agreeing as I do with your senti-
ments on most subjects, still I cannot but-fail to understand
,-our maudlin sympathy in connection with the use of the
lash.’ Not wishing to trespass too much on your valuable
time, I will be as concise as possible. I would ask you one
question: have you a little daughter? (perhaps your only
child, whom you love better than your life). If so, how
would you like her .to be brutally assaulted? . . Would
you not think that 300 lashes with the ‘ cat’ on the back of
ihe blackguard who perpetrated the outrage but small
punishment for his offence? (And you must admit that the
only way to touch the feelings of such blackguards is through
their hides.) Yon say the ‘cat’ is degrading—perhaps it is;
all punishments must be degrading, even 12 hours’ in the
cells for drunkenness. I maintain that the ‘oat’ should be
used with discrimination, great discrimination, but for such
offences as ‘ rape,’ criminal assaults on children, and robbery
with violence, the ‘cat’ should be applied with a strong arm.
Perhaps you will say that should the scoundrels in the
Moore Park case be convicted, the ‘cat’ should be withheld.
I say such brutes should get 300 lashes in instalments of 50
each, have them .... and while their backs are raw
from their last instalment of lashes let them loose among
their ‘ pais ’ as a living example. That would be far greater
punishment than penal servitude, to say nothing of the cost
saved the country. I hope you will be kind enough to give
me a line in your ‘ Correspondence’ column, if only to inform
me you have consigned my letter to the waste-paper basket.
[ am, sir, yours truly, W. Arthur Abel.”
The foregoing letter is a fair sample of
what commonly passes for sound argument
on the subject of torture as a preventive
of crime. The subject is such a large one
that it is impossible in one article to cover
the whole ground. Some aspects of the case,
then, although full of interest and suggestive-
ness, can only be glanced at, while others
mustremainunnoticed. Weusetheword “tor-
ture ” wittingly. That flogging as commonly
practised in the British army and navy a few
years ago, and at present among the civil
population of British Australasia, is justly re-
garded as a vigorous cadet of the once power-
ful family of which the rack, wheel, thumb-
screw, and scavenger’s daughter were mem-
bers, any one can testify who has stood by
the triangles and seen the little rills of blood
that followed each lash, and the small pieces
of raw flesh that became detached as the
punishment proceeded. In “ His Natural
Life ” Marcus Clarke has given a fair, but
by no means overdrawn, picture of a flog-
ing. A still better description is to be
found in the “Autobiography of a Working
Man,” written by a person who had suffered
the punishment himself, and was therefore
the best judge of what it meant. He was a
powerful young Scotchman —a Hooper in the
Scots Greys, as Mr. Archibald Forbes was
some years subsequently—and, ostensibly
for some disobedience, but really in conse-
quence of his supposed democratic tendencies,
found himself one morning securely strapped
to aladder in the regimental riding-school while
being artistically flayed by a couple of farriers.
We cite these merely to show what flogging
is. In one sense, of course, our illustration
is quite irrelevant. For if it can be shown
that by such means crime can be kept at a
minimum, and, more important still, that the
whole community is not lowered and brutal-
ised, then by all means flog away. But we
contend that so long as there are savage
punishments there will be savage crimes, and
that, other things being equal, the people of
a country where bodily torture is common
will be more barbarous in their habits than
those in a land where it is unknown.
•K- * *
Look at the world’s Statute-books. As
civilisation advances, torture ceases, until to-
day, in the more advanced countries-, it is
dead with no hope of resuscitation. In
France, Germany, Italy, and the United
States, with one or two exceptions, it would
be no more possible to restore corporal pun-
ishment than to reconstitute society after the
pattern of the days of Louis XIV. In other
words, 40 millions of Frenchmen, 50 millions
of Germans, 30 millions of Italians, and
nearly 60 millions of Americans are con-
vinced, after centuries of trial, that torture
is a blunder. Nearly 200 millions of people
belonging to nations whose place in the first
line of civilisation none can gainsay can keep
their rascaldom in check without skinning
them. Yet New South Wales, with a popu-
lation less than half that of a first-rate city,
cannot govern without the halberts. This is
simply proclaiming in the world’s face that
the governors, or the governed, or both, of this
happy land are greater scoundrels than are to
be found elsewhere. Even admitting such
to be the case, we certainly might keep the
fact to ourselves.
* ♦ *
A few years ago a prison congress was held
in London. The representatives of the
various European states heard with astonish-
ment that bodily torture was still allowed in
Great Britain. What wonder that Mill,
Dickens, and many others whose names are
household words wherever the literature
they enriched is prized, spoke of the re-intro-
duction of the whipping-post as a step back-
wards in civilisation ! In England this stop
backwards was taken some years ago, on the
occasion of a sudden increase in a particular
form of crime accompanied with violence. It
has since been abundantly and repeatedly
proved that the revival of the lash has had
absolutely nothing to do with the suppres-
sion or restriction of the special offence it
was designed to meet. But while its failure
in one direction has been complete, its suc-
cess in another has been unqualified. It has
succeeded, not alone in inviting the well-
deserved contempt of foreigners, but by
habituating the public to these disgusting
punishments, deadened and perverted public
sentiment. When the subject is pre-
sented in this light there arise the
familiar yells of “maudlin sentiment,”
“ mawkish philanthropy,” “ drivelling
balderdash,” and similar rant from the great
army of dunces who, thinking they have
mastered a difficult subject when they have
merely touched it, parade their crude
theories of crime and bawl for Rhadaman-
thine treatment. But there is nothing more
certain than that —leaving the culprit quite
out of the question— the men who witness a
flogging, and the men, women, and children
who read of it in the journals, are rendered
appreciably callous by the sight or the
description. Some months ago a description of
a Queensland flogging went the rounds of the
papers, and it is not too much to say that it
did more to shock public sentiment, and by
so doing increase the very offence it was
designed to correct, than a dozen unpunished
crimes. It induced thousands scattered
through the various colonies to curse the
laws under which such abominations were
tolerated and the law-givers who made them.
* * *
There is little doubt that the brutality of
the lower classes of the British people—the
wife-beating, animal-torturing, and general
desire to inflict pain—is due largely to the
horrible punishments to which their rulers
so long familiarised them. To curb the
cruel tendencies of a community by the
very means that cause them is the far-seeing
doctrine advocated by the friends of corporal
punishment. It was only in 1816 that a law
proclaiming the “ inexpediency ” of flogging
females was passed by the British Parlia-
ment. Prior to that it was no unusual thing
in an English town to see a writhing wretch
walking at the cart’s tail through the public
streets, her breast and back bare, her hair
bound up or cut short to give the lash fair
play, and the blood trickling from her shoul-
ders as the cat fell on them. From open
windows men and women looked on and
jeered at her cries. What,wonder that those
habituated to such sights massacred, tor-
tured, and outraged at Ciudad Rodrigo the
very people they were sent to support! Yet
when the reformers of 70 years ago demanded
the cessation of such outrages, the cries of
“ mawkish philanthropy ” and “ snivelling
humanitarianism ” filled the air just as we
hear them to-day. But the “ sentiment ”
that many affect to deride is the very thing
that prevents' females from being whipped.
There is no reason why a brutal woman
should not have her back scored as well as a
brutal man. To be fair, then, those who ad-
vocate corporal punishment should clamour
for its extension to women for crimes similar
to those for which men are corrected. It is
not humanity that prompts them to withhold
their advocacy. It is nothing but “ mawkish
sentiment ” that keeps them silent.
* * *
It is a singular fact that among English-
speaking people only has this system of
punishment been revived. In other lands,
wfien it once dies it dies for good. But this
is not all. Before a man is hanged it must
be shown that a murder has been committed
—or attempted ; a corpse or a wounded
man must be produced. Similarly, in rob-
bery with violence, the only offence for
which the lash is used in England, a person
must be brought forward who has been
robbed and maltreated. But such limitations
on the use of the scourge find no favour with
the democracy of Australia. With us,
whether from the tainted surroundings of our
early national life, or from the absence of
any checks which the neighbourhood of cul-
tivated nations might impose, the punish-
ment can be applied, not alone for crimes of
a trivial character, but for those which, of
all others, are most difficult to prove, and
the evidence for which is most easily con-
cocted. With us no man is safe who travels
with women in train or tram, who attracts
the attention of prurient children, or offends
the meanest constable. The inevitable re-
sult has followed. In many cases men en-
tirely innocent, and others guilty of offences
whose proper penalty would have been a
trifling fine or a short incarceration, have
had their lives blasted and thorns, Ives con-
verted into confirmed criminals by the hang-
man’s whip. Let us illustrate.
* * *
Not long ago a bushman having “ knocked
down ” his cheque and entered on a
penance of delirium tremens, wandered into
the Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne. He prob-
ably thought himself away on the Lachlan or
the Darling, and so went to sleep under a
tree, having first removed some of his cloth-
ing and rolled it into a pillow. His sentence
was seventy-five stripes in three instalments
of twenty-five each. Some time last year a
Norwegian sailor came ashore in Sydney
after a long voyage. He misconducted
himself in the bush some miles away with a
common woman who solicited his attentions.
For this he was flogged. To find a case
equalling this for scandalous stupidity it
would be necessary to go back two centuries
to the Puritan settlements of New England,
where men and women were scourged naked
in the market place for following the laws of
their nature. The idea of putting down
sexual instincts with the cat-o’-nine-tails is
peculiarly Anglo-Saxon. Again, it was only
the other day that a chimney-sweep at Yass,
New South Wales, while being hauled to the
lock-up, made use of some dirty and profane
language. For this he was sentenced to 20
lashes and would have received all, but that
outraged nature charitably brought him un-
consciousness with the twelfth stroke, when
the presiding surgeon mercifully ordered his
release, and the savages who witnessed the
torture made up a small collection to send
the bleeding wretch home to his wife and
family ! From the criminal records of any
modern nation we defy the rulers of New
South Wales to produce such an instance as
this of unmeaning savagery. A unique posi-
tion among nations may be fairly claimed
for a people which places in the hands of its
male children the odes of Horace, the
satires of Juvenal, and the accumulated
literary filth of decaying Rome, while its
daughters revel in the garbage of Zola, and
yet meets the stupid ribaldry of a half-crazy
chimney-sweep with the lash. On the shelves
of our public libraries, and in our open
bibles, are to be found more ribaldry and
blasphemy than all the blackguards in the
land could belch in a life-time.
A few weeks ago two men were sentenced in
Sydney to be whipped for a filthy crime. The
evidence against them was that of one police-
man who made the discovery by striking a
match in an open park on a dark night.
Think of the power thus placed in the hands
of a vicious officer ! If the men were guilty
die case should have been sent to a jury.
But no jury would convict on such evidence.
The fact is, as the law stands and is adminis-
tered in New South Wales, none are safe
whom business or pleasure tempts into lonely
places. Thus while the advance of De-
mocracy in other countries means the ad-
vance of humanity, in Australia, as if to
emphasize the anomalous character of the
country, it still leans towards brutality. Why
then, this hypocritical wonder at the out-
rages which from time to time shock the
public conscience I Why not take to heart
the lesson learnt by older nations after cen-
turies of trial—brutal laws make a brutal
people. The working classes of Australia,
in whose hands all political power
lies, are so blind to their own interests as to
make scourges for their own backs. Who
ever hears of a person with good clothes and
a place in what is called “society” being
flogged ? Is it because they are more moral
than their poorer fellow-citizens ? Do not
cases occur daily where the man in broad-
cloth escapes while he in moleskins goes to
the triangles ? There was that case in Mel-
bourne where a scoundrel in evening dress
stood on the steps of the Theatre Royal
while the people were pouring out and
committed a nameless offence. The other
day the head of an important city firm
behaved similarly on a suburban railway
platform. Had obscure individuals been
concerned the papers would have whined
over the disgusting details, while Tartuffish
magistrates would have hastened to prescribe
the “cat.”
* * *
The British army and navy were, up to
quite recently, recruited from the very dregs
of the population. Now men of a far higher
standing find their way into the ranks. Why ?
Because, for one reason, corporal punishment
has been swept away. An armed force with-
out strict discipline is a mere mob, a banditti,
more dangerous to friends than to foes.
Have the discipline and the fighting qualities
of the British suffered through the disappear-
ance of the oat ? Let the recent campaigns
in Afghanistan and the Soudan testify.
Thus it is found that a highly-organ-
ised force, where prompt obedience is
essential, can be governed without the tri-
angles, while a civil population, where no
such obedience is necessary or desirable,
must be flogged into good behaviour. There
is surely food for serious reflection here.
There is something wrong. It is for
the people of Australia to consider
whether they are right in blindly following
the lead of men bred up in the shadow of
the triangles—of men whose limited vision is
incapable of seeing all round a great subject
—of men who, regardless of the experience
of nations which w r ere great and polished
long before the first scream of a tortured
man was heard across Sydney harbour, tottei
towards their unhonoured graves oblivious of
the shame they have brought upon the coun-
try cursed by their adoption.
Provinces First!
“ The future Independence of Australia is written
in the book of Fate.” That is a good, bold, and
plain assertion made five-and-twenty years ago
when men who had thoughts within them did not
shirk emphatic utterance, when the Governor re-
presented the Imperial power and governed, when
Australian statesmen represented Australia and
fought, when the continent had not yet begun to
tremble into form and there was opportunity for
such an arrangement of particles as to make ulti-
mate cohesion easy and sure. There were men in
those days of a truly Australian breadth, neither
provincial nor metropolitan, but continental in
instinct as in plan. The first and foremost amongst
these was John Dunmoue Lang, and a leading
principle of all his larger Australian actions was
that expressed by the title of this article, “Pro-
vinces First.”
» * *
])r. Lang had travelled. He had seen the king-
doms of Europe and the Republic of America; lie
had been down South through the Brazils and the
old Spanish colonies. He was loyal by instinct
and breeding, he was cautious by nature ; hut ho
was a right, true, democratic Australian, by com-
pulsion of the whole might of duty and the (cach-
ing of much experience. Fifty years of such iargo
life as few men know, and a full half of it up and
down on all the Eastern coast of this continent,
had convinced him that the greatest hope the
future held was of an Australian nation and
an Australian Republic. He set himself to
realise that hope, to evolve from it a prac-
tical plan, to plot the lines by which that plan
should ultimately be wrought out, and these were
a few' of his ideas. No province must bo tec
large—so large as to have a preponderating in-
fluence in any union. Such is the teaching of
Nature, and such the accepted principle in
America. Texas desired to join the Union, and
Texas was annexed by the House of Representa-
tives, but “ the American Senate, as the guardian
of the rights and interests of the people through-
out the Union would not allow the annexation
until a proviso had been inserted in the Act for the
division of Texas into four distinct States as soon
as tiro progress of settlement and the amount of
population should warrant such a division.”
* * *
That passage was written before any sub divi-
sion of New Holland had been made, when lines
of demarcation had not been drawn, and when
statesmanship had opportunity to give effect to its
ideas. And, says the old doctor, always following
the teachings of Nature and seeing the great Aus-
tralia of the near future, “ the natural boundary of
N.S. W. northward is the 30th parallel ” —soul h of
the Clarence River and the sugar country. The
Clarenoo, Richmond, and Tweed he considered to
be allied to Brisbane (the free Brisbane he planted).
“ And then Dawes Range, on the 25th parallel,
would have formed the southern boundary of the
future colony still farther North.”
* # *
How easy for any well-informed and unprejudiced
man to take up the map to-day and note the ad-
vantages of these natural divisions. And how
were they changed or lost 2 Let Governor Denison,
who was fooling with his round towers and ginger-
bread fortifications in Sydney harbour, And a
reply. He was in the hands of Wentworth and
the squatting party, and New Holland was divided
by him, not in the broad and general interests of
Australia, but to suit the squatters. The twenty-
eighth parallel and Macpherson’s range were made
the Northern boundaries. The Clarence and Rich-
mond were tied to Sydney, the whole ef the North
shackled to Brisbane. And what have been the
results ! In New South Wales alone they cannot
be described as other than deplorable. The Aus-
tralian idea has been lost —a game of boggar-my-
neighbour has taken the place of statesmanship.
A jealousy base and foolish almost as the senti-
ment of the old emancipists has been nurtured
and cherished against Victoria and Queensland,
and no labour has seemed so good as that which
tended to suck Australia and feed Sydney. Rail-
ways have been pushed away to Victorian and
Queensland boundaries, and goods carried over
them at losing rates. No great effort has been
made to improve the many harbours on the coast,
better make coastal railways and give all the trade
to Sydney. Sydney, Sydney everywhere; if we
can only make Sydney a little larger than Mel-
bourne it will be quite enough.
It is altogether mean and miserable work,
no thought for a great future in _ it, no fate
plan for a satisfactory present, and it has been
very faithfully copied in Queensland. An the
North through all the years of Australian histop
has been neglected for, if not sacrificed to, i> us

A Colossal Job.
Considerable interest will be felt by miners in
the proceedings which have lately taken place in
Iho Queensland Parliament in connection with a
petition presented by one William Marshall
asking for an enquiry into the means whereby
the whole of the Mount Morgan gold-field has
been handed over to one company. A gold-field,
especially if it be an exceptionally rich one such
as Mount Morgan (which is said to yield about
£3O 000 weekly), is a very desirable piece of pro-
perty. But until lately it has never happened in
Australia that one party has been able to secure a
whole gold-field to themselves. It will, therefore,
interest miners generally to learn how this has
been achieved, and the story may also operate as
a warning to the miners of New South Wales
and Victoria against being led to rush to Queens-
land by the favourable accounts sometimes re-
ceived from the Northern fields.
* * *
Mount Morgan was discovered to be auriferous
In 1882, and was proclaimed a gold-field on 20th
September, 1883. The gold was first discovered
in stone on a freehold of 640 acres belonging to
one Gordon, a selector, who was bought out by
the originators of the Mount Morgan Company for
£(!10 (before he know that his little estate contained
a gold-mine). This 640 acres, however, did not cover
the whole of the gold-field, and the Mount Morgan
Company proceeded to secure that portion which
was outside their freehold. Complaints were soon
heard that extended claims had been granted to
them (although by the Queensland regulations
such claims can only be granted :
1. When the ground has been previously worked and aban-
doned.
2. When it is so poor that it will not pay for working by ordi-
nary methods.
3. When the expense of procuring and erecting machinery
is unusually great.)
None of these conditions existed at Mount Morgan.
Then complaints were made that gold-mining
leases were issued to the company within two
months of the proclamation of the gold-field, al-
though by the Queensland law leases cannot be
issued on any gold-field within two years from the
date of its proclamation. Then there was an entry
that the Warden refused to permit the mining
registrar at Rockhampton to receive applications
for any land claimed by the Company, so that
miners who wished to dispute their title could not
get into court to do so.
* * *
But as certain points have been proved by re-
turns laid before the Parliament of Queensland,
and by proceedings in the courts of the colony, we
will lay before our readers those facts, which have
been proved :
Ist. The largest reward claim which, by the Queensland
regulations, can be granted to any prospector for the
discovery of a new gold-field is 500 x 400 feet But
for the discovery of Mount Morgan the Warden
granted the company 1200 x 400 feet.
2nd. Extended claims can only be granted under the cir-
cumstances mentioned before, which did not exist at
Mount Morgan, but the Warden granted the Com-
pany extended claims enabling each man employed
to hold four times the area which he could otherwise
have held, although the applications did not set
forth any grounds on which extended claims should
be granted, nor did the Warden state any reason for
granting them.
3rd. Two gold-mining leases were issued to the Company
within two months after the proclamation of the
gold-field—contrary to the provisions of the Gold
Fields Act.
4th, These leases were granted although notices of the ap-
plication tor them had not been posted and published
as required by the regulations.
sth, An action having been commenced against the Com-
pany by parties who disputed the validity of these
leases, the Company was permitted immediately after
the termination of the two years from the proclama-
tion of the gold-field to surrender these leases, and
others were issued to them whilst their title was still
in litigation.
6th. The Warden instructed the Mining-Registrar at Rock-
hampton to refuse to receive applications for land
occupied by the company, and himself tore down
some notices which had been received by the Regis-
trar and posted as required by the regulations, and
returned them to the applicants, refusing to hear or
decide upon their applications.
7th. A miner named Bond having applied to the Supreme
Court for a mandamus to compel the Warden to
hear and decide on his application, the counsel for
the Company objected that as Bond had applied in
his own name for more than 50 x 400 feet, his appli-
cation was bad, and the Warden was justified in re-
fusing to entertain it, and the Supreme Court upheld
this objection.
6th. From the Register of Claims it appears that the
Warden had registered for one applicant, being a
member of the Company, 1200 x 400 feet in one claim
and for two, 3600 x 400 feet. The Warden had also
registered for the members of the Company two
claims (“ area not stated,") and the total area of the
claims registered for the members of the Company
was 15,400 x 400 feet, in addition to the two claims,
whose area was not stated, and this amount of
ground was taken up in the names of eight persons,
of whom several were minors.
3th. One of these claims was registered as exempt from
work for six months within six months after it was
taken, and shortly after for an additional four
months’ exemption, contrary to.the regulations.
13th. All the original documents connected with the Mount
Morgan claims, applications, &0., have disappeared
mysteriously, and are not to be found either in the
Warden’s Office at Rockhampton or in the Mines
Office at Brisbane.
Hth. When the Company bought the 640-acre freehold from
Gordon, the deed of grant transferred to them de-
scribed the boundary lines as bearing to the cardinal
points of the compass in accordance with the Regu-
lations of the Queensland survey department. After
the value of the Mount Morgan field was well proved
the Company surrendered this deed to the Government
who issued to them another deed in which the bear-
ings of the boundary lines were altered so as to throw
out some land formerly included in it, and take in
some that was not. About 58 acres of the richest
part of the gold-field that was before outside the
freehold was by this alteration brought within it.
This second deed purports to be issued under the
“Corrected Titles to Land Act of 1832,” but that Act
doesnot authorise any such thing as has been done here,
and the issue of this second grant is clearly illegal.
* * *
All those numerous illegal and improper things
having been done in favour of the Company, it is
ot to be wondered at that reports have been
«*nt in Queensland that leading Government
nicials and politicians were shareholders in
fr oun t Morgan, and this idea has been much
' ren gthened by the secrecy maintained as to the
composition of the company. For although by
e Queensland law an association of more than 20
Persons has no legal status as a company unless
egistered, and although more than 20 persons are
Qown to be shareholders in Mount Morgan, yet
e company has not been registered, and the in-
('fence drawn is that it is to the interest of the

presentation the Legislative Assembly
hsed to receive the petition, adopting the
opinion of Sir S. Griffith (who is also counsel
for the Mount Morgan Company) that it was dis-
respectful to the House to allege that the conduct
of the Warden at Rockhampton had been “ unjust
oppressive, and illegal.” It is to be noticed that
the House of Commons has not only often re-
ceived petitions impeaching public officers in lan-
guage quite as strong, but that it has itself used
stronger language in petitioning the Crown {vide
declaration of right and ground remonstrance).
The Assembly in Queensland has also of late years
several times received a petition impugning the
action of the Judges of the Supreme Court.
* *
On these objectionable words being expunged,
however, the Assembly received the petition, but
refused any enquiry on the grounds (brought for-
ward by Sir S. Griffith again) that the case was
still in litigation. The litigation consists of two
appeals to the Privy Council, and no evidence
taken now could be laid before the Privy Council
or in any way affect the decision in that tribunal.
It is to be noted, too, that Sir S. Griffith, who
considers that no enquiry should be made into the
conduct of Government officers who lie under
suspicion of having been corruptly influenced in
the performance of their public duties whilst
litigation arising out of their conduct is proceed-
ing, did not see that the fact of the right to cer-
tain claims being in litigation was any reason why
the Government should not issue fresh leases for
the disputed ground to the Mount Morgan Com-
pany,
* * *
There can bo no doubt that there is a prima
facie case of the greatest suspicion against the
administration of the Mines and Lands Depart-
ments in Queensland in connection with this
affair, and that suspicion will be increased by the
refusal of the Assembly to investigate the grounds
of it. We trace the history of this business, how-
ever, with ming'ed feelings. On the one hand it
affords us some satisfaction to consider that the
Legislature of New South Wales is not, as some
would have us believe, the worst in Australia. The
members of the N.S.W. Assembly have their
little eccentricities. They yell abuse at each other
in the House, and playfully punch each other’s
heads in the lobbies. But they have never assisted
to cloak corruption in the public service by re-
fusing to enquire into such a case as this.
On • the other hand, we feel sorry to mark the
decay of that great independent body of miners
who at one time were so powerful and did so much
for these colonies. Try to imagine any Govern-
ment granting Ballarat or Lambing Flat or
Temora to one company by such dodges as have
been practised in Queensland ! The very idea is
absurd. The Ministry that tried it would have
disappeared for ever. But in Queensland the
miners stand it. They grumble, but, so far, they
have submitted to being robbed of their birthright.
The calmness with which the working-miner has
stood by while those responsible for this colossal
job have spread their claws over one of the richest
gold-flelds on earth surely favours the theory that
the white race degenerates in a hot climate.
Under such an administration of the Gold-Fields
Act it is plain that the sons of the Northern miner
must grow up to be not men, but “ crawlers.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Too Great Britain.
The latest addition to the “bunkum” statisticians
is Professoi John Fiske, of the United States,
who prophesies that before the end of next cen-
tury there will be 600,000,000 English-speakers
in his own country, 150,000,000 ditto in Austra-
lasia, 50,000,000 in Canada, 30,000,000 in South
Africa, and a few other “ hundred millions ” of
Anglo-Saxons scattered around generally over the
habitable globe. He is still a little behind that
Swiss “statistician,” who, a short time ago, reckoned
out that by the year 2000, a.d., there will be
1,500,000,000 English-speaking people (rather
more than the entire present population of the
earth). How do these philosophers arrive at their
alarming conclusions, which the Jingo Press
delights to copy and gloat over without ever stop-
ping to ask whether they are well founded ? The
modus operandi is very simple. You find that
some particular country, under peculiar circum-
stances, has doubled its population, say in 20 or 25
years, and you carry this on (with the aid of pen
and paper) for a century or two with magnificent
results. It is the story of the nails in the
horse-shoe all over again. But here the
question comes in Can the pace last 2
We are not going into the Malthusian question —■
don’t be afraid. We will just say that the Mal-
thusian proposition, “ that population tends to
increase-faster than the food-supplies,” has been
apparently knocked on the head by the sudden
occupation of vast tracts of new, fertile country
combined with immense improvements in agricul-
ture. But perhaps it is only temporarily the
“ grim theory ” has been put down ; it may come
up frowning again the moment population has
levelled up to the increased food production which
took the strain somewhat off the machine for a
very short while. The law of population and the
laws of national development and decay are dark
mysteries yet, on whose threshold we are only
just standing, peering into the gloom. Statistics
help ns but little ; we have, even in the most civi-
lised countries, only some half century ef reliable re-
cords to go upon. But we do know one thing. Popu-
lation and civilisation sometimes increase with won-
derful celerity—we might say mushroom rapidity,
if the life of our planet is taken into consideration—
and then die down again with even greater speed.
Egypt, Persia, and the old Gmco-Roman civilisa-
tion are cases in point, and should make these
modern statisticians who deal in humanity by the
hundred million, pause to think. China may be
quoted as an exception to the up-and-down move-
ment of nations and population, but we know
nothing as to whether the number of Celestials is
less or greater now than it was in those palmy
days of the Middle Empire when mediteval
travellers from Europe were astonished at its
wealth and the grandeur of its cities. We do,
however, know that the vast population which is
to-day huddled together on the fertile soil of
China, lives for the most part in an inconceivable
condition of wretchedness and degradation,
and that the numbers of the beehive are
only kept down by sweeping plagues and famine,
and by infanticide and other practices peculiar
to the country. The daily pittance of a Chinese
or an Indian labourer would not stand an
Australian in a single drink, and the arti-
san’s working hours are from dawn to 10 p.m.
Is this “ the pretty state of things ” which the
prophets of universal Anglo-Saxondom want us to
people down to, or do they complacently view the
approach of the time when “ every rood of
ground” shall not only support its man,” but when
poor humanity shall be packed together like sar-
dines in a tin 2 Do these philosophers think we can
get rid of surplus population by shoving it off into
space, or asking it to hang on to the earth by its
eyebrows 2 Or is it supposed that the year 2000 a.d.
will be the beginning of the millennium, and the
end of all mundane difficulties, at least for the
Anglo-Saxon race ? We can imagine the saintly
nigger from the Southern States (he speaks English,
you know) posted at the Wesleyan entrance to the
millennial Paradise, waving back the crowds of
unhappy Continentals and Orientals who are throng-
ing towards the golden gate, and -limiting at them :
“ Stand back dar, you low foreign trash, and
leave de track clear for de Anglo-Saxon gen Tums
whose gwine to ockipy dis yar reserve.” Speaking
seriously, we would remind the clairvoyant statis-
ticians who handle the multiplication table with
such vigour, and the daily newspapers who
delight to do them honour, that this rapid and
continuous doubling of the population would in-
fallibly be accompanied by recurrent periods of
“ hard times” such as we have never seen yet—
low wages, long spells of “no work,” aad lhat
terrible repressive agency—gaunt famine. Emigra-
tion is becoming with every year less and less a
solution of the population difficulty, and it will be
ever more and more necessary that each country
shall seriously set itself to solve the problem of
how to support its own people in comfort and
content.

The “Representative Australians”
and the London Poor.
A Herald special telegram (and there must be
exceedingly lax supervision in the Herald’s Lon-
don office or that telegram would have been
burked) states that “ the appeal made to the Aus-
tralian colonists on behalf of the London poor has
not met with any substantial response.” The
presence and the sufferings of the poor were plain
enough, the appeal made by the East-end bisho
was doubtless eloquent enough, but the “colon
ists ” were not at home for that sort of thing.
They had sat at the boards of the men of weal:h.
they had taken their fill o r the lllched meed
of labour, yet had they studied the foundations of
the entertainments they had received they would
doubtless have found themselves very deeply in-
debted to the London poor. But that is precisely
what they did not do, they studied nothing but
themselves, their own feelings, their own stomachs,
their own desires, to which the nod of a duke or
the forefinger of an earl, or the distant smile of a
prince came as all-satisfying provender. The poor
of London! What could the poor of London do
for Smith, K.C.M.G., or the “Honorable”
Jones 1 There were a hundred and ten thousand
of them by latest statistics all wanting broad, fire,
clothes; all idle and hungry and destitute, and was
it to be expected that “Australian colonists”
would go down amongst them or would send any of
their surplus wealth amongst them 1 But “surplus,”
says a visitor, who never posed as a distinguished
colonist, “ bless you, they have no surplus ; if
you only knew how they intrigue for every invita-
tion, how they pay through the nose for every
telegram and paragraph, how they hunt popularity
and purchase recognition, you would pity them
scarcely less than the London poor.” And there
is very little doubt that so much is true, and after
all we may render thanks that, apart from the
“ distinguished colorist, we have one or two
good representatives in London who do not make
much figure on “ great occasions,” nor yet awa : t
a bishop’s appeal to deal their bread to the hungry
poor.

When she has a doubt to quell.

Touching diff’rent kinds of beer.

And looked and felt uncommonly soro,
About one they’d cause to fear.
So she gather’d opinions all around
And put them all to lest;
And none can question he* judgment sound.
For the more she search’d she more she found
That Clausen’s Lager was best.
And the lovely eyes of the goddess gleam’d
As she spoke in her o am good name :
Let this my vordic be rigidly deem'd ;
Let the voice of Truth be well esteem’d ;
Hand tho “ Phoenix” brand to Fame.

The following excerpts are from amass of favor-
able testimony:—
“THE BEST OX THE MARKET.”
Messrs. Lucas Bros., wine and spirit merchants
of 10, Pitt-street, write “ With great pleasure
we add our testimony to the merits aid great,
superiority of Clausen’s Lager Beer. We have
been supplying it wholesale to our customers all
over the colony for some time. It has given
them the greatest satisfaction, and we feel bound
to say it is the best Lager Beer that has yet been
placed on this market. The bottles have large
contents, the beer is entirely free from sediment
is clear, bright, and sparkling, and above all re-
freshes without producing drowsiness. We find’
its well-deserved patronage daily increasing.”
“SUPERIOR TO EVERY OTHER BRAND.”
Mr. Fred W. Forster, of the Theatre Royal
Hotel, saysHaving had considerable ex-
perience in America, where Lager is considered
the national drink, I have much pleasure in inform-
ing you that I have found Clausen’s Champagne
Lager Beer superior to every other brand. I have
had it on sale here ever since its introduction, and
am pleased to state that it has given unqualified
satisfaction to my patrons, all of whom speak of
it in the highest terms, and prefer it to every other
for its brightness, flavor, and purity. From a trade
point of view I have never had a single breakage
to complain of, or a bottle in bad condition ; and
can honestly recommend it as a perfect Lager in
every respect. It is entirely free from sediment
and waste, and is undoubtedly the leading brand
in the market, and in my opinion will long remain
so.
“IN EVERY WAY PLEASED WITH IT.”
Mr. Harry R. Boulton, of Pfahlert s Hotel,
Wynyard-square, says “ I have much pleasure
in testifying to the excellence of Clausen’s Cham-
pagne Lager Beer, which I have handled since
taking the above hotel. I am in every way pleased
with it, and for freedom from sediment, and excel-
lence of flavor, I have every confidence in recom-
mending it to the trade and the public generally.
“ENTIRE SATISFACTION.”
Mr. Daniel Sullivan, of the Brisbane Cafe,
George-street, says “ Clausen’s Champagne
Lager Beer gives my patrons entire satisfaction.
For brightness, purity, and flavor I consider it un-
equalled, and every person seeking a light refresh-
ing drink, which will invigorate without intoxi-
cating, and refresh without promoting drowsiness,
should sample a bottle of Clausen’s Lager.”
“GREAT SUPERIORITY.”
Mr. G. F. Baker, proprietor of the Pastoral
Hotel, Wagga, says “ I have great pleasure in
bearing testimony to the great superiority of Clau-
sen’s Lager Beer. My customers approve of it, and
rarely ask for any other brand.-”
“ FAR EXCELS ANY BEER.”
Mr. Bryan Ferry, of the Advance Australia
Hotel, Newtown, Wagga, says “ I have great
pleasure indeed in testifying to the excellence of
Clausen’s Lager Beer. It is pronounced by all my
customers to far excel any beers of a like
character.”
“THE FAVORITE BRAND.”
Mr. F. L. Richardson, of the Albion Hotel,
Forbes, says “I have great pleasure in recom-
mending H. Clausen and Son’s brand of Lager
Beer. It is the favorite brand with my customers,
and during hot months the demand for it is large.”
“EXCELLENT QUALITY AND PURITY.”
Mr. Charles Stock well, of the Freemasons’ Hotel,
Molong, says “ I have much pleasure in testi-
fying to the excellent quality and purity of Clau-
sen’s Champagne Lager Beer. It has given great
satisfaction to the numerous customers visiting my
hotel.”

The Referee
The Glebe Rowing Club have made ad-
ditions to both their club buildings and rules, the
former consisting of a new story, and the latter of
a clause that will in the end lead to the old, old
story for some poor devil. The clause is that card-
playing will bo allowed till midnight on every
n'ght bar Sunday. The Club had a leg-iu for the
Junior Cup rowed tor at the recent Association
Regatta, and another win would have placed the
handsome trophy in their permanent possession,
bat they were unable to raise a crew, and rumour
has it that the card-playing had a big hand in
that. Card-playing till midnight is more calcu-
-1 iled to turn out a champion stone-broker than a
champion sculler.

One would have thought that the
bourhood which claims the brothers Sparks for
residents would have turned out something good
in the pugilistic line, but the three Gannons
Forest men, whom we have, so far, seen perform,
are the veriest duffers that ever donned a mitten.
Pickering, who hails from that classic spot, on
Wednesday night met the much talked of Jack
Donohoe, but the tight would have made a good
show for a nigger minstrel entertainment. For
five rounds Donohoe chased his man round the
ring, punishing the air severely with vicious right-
handers, when Pickering lay down and went to
sleep with the determination not to be disturbed
for at least ten seconds. We are at a loss to know
where Donohoe got his reputation from, for we
could put our hands on some half-dozen men of
his weight who could wipe the floor with him.
The best set-to at Foley’s on Saturday night was
between Molloy and Tom Taylor. Molloy has
improved vastly since his residence in Sydney, and
J ickson’s protege, Taylor, showed, in addition to
his reputation as a hard hitter, that he is pos-
sessed of good science.

Dick Mathews, the Yankee boxer, who
S vopt Maoriland and more recently fought some
desperate battles in ’irisco, is, we heai, hack in
New Zealand. Mathews is the only man in the
colonies likely to tackle the present champion,
Jackson hut the Yank must he a vastly improved
man to’stand any show. Mathews, when in
Sydney had a quiet trial with Jackson in Sussex-
street, when Jackson soon proved himself master
of the situation.

The twelfth annual regatta of the Sydney
Mercantile Rowing Club came off at the Branch
o r i Saturday last, when the amateur champion,
W. G. Brett, added the senior double sculls and
smior fours to his many other victories, the
£ inner in conjunction with W. G. Charles, and the
litter with S. A. Kemp, W. G. Charles, and J. O.
Trimble Mr. Brett is certainly a wonder at the
game. Some 10 years ago ho started rowing at an
a T e when nine amateurs out of ten give it up, and
he has stuck hard at it ever since, we suppose
winning more trophies than any aquatic amateur
the world has yet produced.

A Queensland correspondent asks us to
Kive the height and weight of Mr. George Scale,
the champion amateur boxer the general im-
pression being in the country seems to be that he is
a big fellow who boxes his men down with brute
s'rength Mr. Seale, who, by the way, has never
been bested in a set-to with either amateur or pro-
fessional, stands oft. BJin., and weighs some lOst.
101 b in condition. In his clothes he does not look
to weigh much over 10 stone., and if our corres-
nondent went into a room with a score of average
men in it on the look-out for a row, he would for
a certainty pick upon the guileless-lookirg youth
who revels in the title of amateur champion.

To see Donohue and Pickering pocket
their flsts-full of bank notes at Foley’s the other
niaht for boxing five rounds was enough to raise
old ‘‘ Boruk ” out of his grave. Who was Boruk ?
Well Boruk was the trial horse of the good old
pugilistic days. If a man was brought in with a
name from the provinces he was matched for a
tenner or so against Boruk, who would either
smash him or be smashed, perhaps both, out of all
semblance to humanity. If Boruk won, the pro-
vincial’s light was out, so far as the championship
honours were concerned, but the man who could
beat the trial horse was looked upon as worth
following up. Ye gods ! If Boruk could see how
they earn their “ sugar ’ in these degenerate days !
Champion Beach left England for ' ‘ home
by the Lusitania on October 14. He received a
great ovation on leaving, and will, of course, have

The Totalisator Bill squeezed through the
S.A. Assembly on its third reading, and the in-
strument of gambling is in a fair way to get
another trial. Among the half-and-half opponents
of the totalisator was a genius who moved that it
be used only for weight for age races. A truly
smart idea this, considering that it is in these
events that the backer is least at the mercy of the
wily “ book.” It often happens that over a handi-
cap with 20 starters the metallicians offer such
starvation prices that they can bet fairly round
and still have half the field running for their
volumes. In such cases the machine would come
as a boon and a blessing to takers of the odds.
But wi h ordinary weight-for-age races the betting
is very close, and the margin of profit left tor the
“books” is very little more than would bo de-
ducted as commission by the machinists.” If the
S. A. Bill becomes law the fielders will shake the
dust of the colony from their number fifteens, and
depart for Victoria. There bookmaking is classi-
fied as a native industry, and duly protected. The
“ sheeny” interest is quite strong enough to over-
turn any Ministry that ventured to interfere with
Joe Thompson and his disciples.

was, perhaps, the more remarkable circumstance
of the two. Some years ago a similar wager' was

The story goes that on the Jewish Day of
Atonement a very “ long-winded” client of a cer-
tain Melbourne bookmaker waited upon the
metallician at the synagogue and offered payment
of his little outstanding wager. Thc bookie
declined to touch the filthy lucre upon the holy
day whereupon the client calmly buttoned up his
pocket-flap over the cheque. And having once
tendered the amount he now refuses to pay, and
refers Mossy to the Y.R.C. Committee,
Although this last Australian team of
alleged cricketers has made a yery poor show in
the field the gate-money is as handsome as ever.
At Brighton alone the team pocketed £433 as their
share of the profits. So the much-defeated ones
will have plenty of sweet consolation.

Pious Aucklanders stood aghast at the
goings-on of the unregenerate Sydney footballers
during their visit to New Zealand’s northern
capital. The boys, instead of remembering the
Sabbath day to keep it holy, preferred going fish-
ing to going to church, thereby robbing the col-
lection-plate of many threepenny-bits, not only
their own donations but the donations of those
who would have gone to church if the footballers
had gone. Some people are so constituted that
they never go to worship unless some special at-
traction is thrown in. Auckland stands unique
for shoddy holiness of that description,

The champion short-distance N.S.W.
i aeing track is at Tam worth, where six furlongs
seem to make one mile. If it is true that this
course is two furlongs short, all mile and over
paces that have taken place on it should appar-
ently be struggled for again, as clause 109 of the
A J.C. rules distinctly says “If a race has been
run by all the horses at wrong weights, or a wrong
distance, .... the Committee shall order
it to be ran again at such time on the same day as
they may appoint.”
The Referee asserts that Beach's record
“ upsets all that has been done in the last few
years,” and describes his style as “ old-fashioned
but most effective,” differing from that of Hanlan
and the American school in that the weight is put
into the stroke most when the oar is at right
angles to the boat, while with Teenier, Ross, and
Co., the'emphasis come at the finish of the stroke.
It is interesting to read such criticism, but it is
worthy of note that no London writer has yet set
himself to describe our William’s peculiar and re-
markable beauty.
Of horseracing in Australia “ Pendragon ”
writes much in recent numbers of the Referee.
And it is in the main highly commendatory. Caul-
field course he declares to be like Epsom or San-
down with all the improvements and conveniences
in which the latter grounds are wanting. In
stecple-chasinghe asserts that England as compared
with the colonies comes off second-best. After
describing the stone walls and paling fences at
Flemington, he nays: “It is no exaggeration
whatever to say that for height and solidity we
have nothing like these fences in England, or even
in Ireland. They are to my eyes —and I have
seen most of the cross-country work that is worth
seeing at home—little short of appalling. . . .
I am free to admit that we are right out of it with
the Australiaus across a country.” But of the
shape of Victorian courses he writes in much less
complimentary terms, assorting that even at
Fiemington the home turn is too near home, and
the curves at Caulfield at the time of his visit and
Moonce Valley too sharp for safety, and winds up
his homily with the perhaps unnecessarily strong
remark that, “ To kill a jockey, or even two, in
Australia is not regarded as any very extraordin-
ary performance; but, then, in Australia they
have not as yet got to the lengths of jockeyolatry,
or anything like them, which are current in En'g-
land.”

New Opera House— “lngomar" „
“ Ingomar,” is being greeted nightly by
rowded audiences at Sydney Opera House, and
well deserves the success it lias attained. Th
scene of the story is laid in the Greek colony
Massilia, and there we find Parthenia, th
heroine, who looks as lovely as a hourl amid ho
sordid surroundings. Her parents, however, ar
poor, and as mean as two contemptible Greek
well can be. They resolve to mate their daughte
with the miser Polydor, and presently that ind
vidual crawls in to press his suit—a bald, broken
backed, flat-chestcd spectre, uncertain on his leg
grovelling, grasping, vinegary, vicious as an ole
blue mule, and with a hundred odious vices wri
ten on his ugly countenance. He is repulsed wit
scorn, and when Parthenia a few moments late
receives news that her father has been capturec
by the barbarians he lets out the wrath of hi
mean dog-soul in jeers which nerve the girl to
desperate resolve. She starts for the mountain
and gives herself up as a hostage for the paymen
of the prisoner’s ransom. In the barbarian camp
however, the Greek maid is in unpleasant-lookin
company. A dozen squat savages are playin
ssvon-up or some such game on the grass, anc
when a dispute arises one of them straightwa
heaves up a huge battle-axe—an iron panoram
fixed on a telegraph-pole—and starts to brain hi
opponent. But Parthenia’s beauty and fearless
ness gradually tame even the fiercest of the crowc
—the chief Ingomar, a huge, leggy ruffian wit
a horse-laugh, who goes about armed wit
sword and spear, and a vast saucepan-lit
which passes for a shield, and at last he tells hi
love in tones that are calculated to tea
up the neighbouring vegetables by the
root. But he, too, is repulsed with scorn
and in his Gallic fury he shrieks out that h
could tear-r-r-r-r-r-r himself with rage. He eve
draws his sword on the captive girl, but when hi
followers assail her his mood changes, and h
pounds the whole blood-stained, cow-stealing
seven-up gang in her defence. Ingomar israpidl
undergoing a change. He no longer enjoys
murder, or cares to paint the country red as o
old, and finally he turns Greek himself, and settle
down in Massilia to woo Parthenia for his bride
Here Polydor is in his way, and the miser has be
come even more limp and slimy and mean ant;
fangus grown than of old ; he is aided and abetted
too, by Parthenia’s mother, an unspeakable ok
Greek cat of the dark ages, and he calls in the aic
of the Timarch or Governor, an individual whose
attire consists chiefly of a helmet and a pair o
spidery legs. It is gratifying to see, however
tliat all this star combination of hungry villainy
is bowled out at last ; Polydor is hit on the heac
by a chunk of retributive justice, and ejected
from the town; the sour Greek female is extin
gnished, and Ignomar wins his bride and rises to
the rank of an ancient K. C. M. G,
* * *
In the character of Parthenia Miss Essie
deny ns is perfect. Her charming face and beauti
ful figure suit the sweeping Greek robes in which
she is attired, and it is no wonder that Ingomar
yields to the fascination of her innocence, her
dauntless courage, and her overflowing joyous
ness. She was called before the curtain at the
close of every act, and the ovation she received
was well earned. Mr. W. J. Holloway was better
as Ingomar than as Romeo. Except when he
wanted to “ tear-r-r-r-r-r-r-r himself” in the third
act, he made a manly and bulky barbarian, though
he shook the landscape a little when he took to
running. Polydor was played by Mr. Charles
Holloway, and was depicted as the meanest Greek
skunk on this side of creation. He also wanted
to “ tear r-r-r,” and now and then he tore in real
earnest, and when he did so he forgot his aged
rheumatism and became a rather too agile skunk
for his years. As regards the other characters it
is only receseary to remark that the Timarch did
a stately goose-step throughout, and the scanty
nature of his wardrobe showed it off to perfection;
that the ordinary barbarians were a hang-dog
crew, and that the male Greeks were, without
•xception, individuals whose small and con-
temptible souls were not good enough to be stood
on by a hog.

“The Octoroon,” which is now on the
boards at Sydney Royal Standard, is a tragedy
which seems always to take well with an Aus-
tralian audience. It contains the elements which
make up a good play—in the estimation of the pit
especially. There is the usual young female in
distress and the good-looking young man who
would give his life to save her, but who, after all,
does not Burst one button off his pants in his
efforts on her behalf ; there is an atrocious villain
out of whom solid hunks of blasphemy and evil
might be dug with a hoe ; and a spidery, comic
saint who is very handy with his knife in an
emergency; there are a fight, a murder, and a
burning steamer, and there are a number of
heavy-booted sympathisers who plod across the
stage chewing tobacco and say they’ll be darned
ml to blazes if it ain’t an all fired shame,
All these things help to make up a great
tragedy, but “ The Octoroon ” is not a great
tragedy all the same. Even the united efforts of
the long withered Yankee and the clay-daubed
tndian cannot lift it out of the region of sickly
sentiment, and a barbarous outrage has been per-
petrated by introducing a party of step-dancing
mggers in tights, who do grotesque hops while
the heart of the heroine is breaking. The man
who is responsible for this insult to humanity
would play euchre in a tomb and
chalk his score on the corpse. After
witnessing the performance of the niggers we
gave way to a feeling of calm despair ; even when
the great scene in the swamp came on and we
noticed Lhai the canes waved at the roots instead
of the tops it failed to arouse us, and we hardly
cared a cent whether the Indian or the white man
went undermost in the fight.
# * *
The descent from “Faust” to “The
Octoroon ” is a tremendous one, but Mr. Dam-
pier’s fall is worse still. From Mephistopheles to
Wah-no-tee is a downward rush, compared to
which the collapse of Lucifer or of Bumble
was as nothing. The Indian, no doubt,
is an imposing kind of tenth-rate savage,
but regarded as a leading character, his
only attraction is that he goes into a
fight and wins. When there is a fight, we
observe, Mr. Dam pier is always in it, but it is
humiliating for an actor of his undoubted abilities
to loaf about througli three acts and say nothing
but“wuff.” Towards the end the Indian rouses
up, and now and then he remarks “ugh ” as well,
and once, at a moment of great excitement, he
mutters “yah,” but despite this eloquence the
part is a miserable fraud. Mr. Harry Leston has
the best character as Salem Scudder, and makes a
very good Yankee, as stage Yankees go ; Jacob
M’Closky, as pourtrayed by Mr. Stoneham, is a
picturesque brute, and having said this we will
sink the rest of our sentiments till next week.

During the week “ Billeo Taylor ” has
filled the bill and more than half the Theatre
Royal, Sydney. Conscientiously, we can’t say that
the opera is worthy of the house in which it is
played, the artistes who are engaged, or the
audiences it draws. Current report asserts that
it takes nine tailors to make a man, but it would
take about 19 “ Billee Taylors” to make a comic
opera. The piece, too, has an evil habit of getting
worse and more uninteresting every day as it
totters on its unmelodious way, and the indi-
viduals forming the “ exceptional cast ” by which
it is played begin to look as if they would like to
cast the dry bones of the production into the sea.
No one but a Stephens would have dreamt of
making William Taylor the hero of an opera, and J
we don’t think even he would have done it if
Solomon had not goaded him to the act, yet we
hardly like to think so badly of any man as to lay
this accusation at Solomon’s door. Perhaps after
all it was the hand of Fate
which forced them to it.

there was subdued dramatic action in his contor-

and we tried to think of the shriek that-dog would
have given if he had been hit with “ Bric-a-

what sort of thing Mr. Garnet Walch had written
expressly for him (vide advertisement), and we

mind Mr. Welch’s look of sorrow when he learned
what Mr. Rickards had done with his production,
but the broad page was not large enough to hold
the sketch. Mr. Rickards, as usual, acts seven
chamctcrs, and after watching him we reckon the
old Scripture injunction does not apply. To forgive
him unto seventy times seven would mean condon-

The new programme of the Chicago

less entertaining thin a first-class dog-fight.
Mr. Whitworth now sings “ Give me a home by

by the Dead Sea or the Caspian; Miss Millie Her-
bert has got anew stentorian boom in which she
says “ I dreamt, my little boy, of thee,” and Harry

Carrots dipped in gin are better, but perhaps
Harry never tried them. Some of these song l . 1 , are
fully equal to the shriek a cat gives when run
over by a tram-car, and others are a little better
still. An exception must be made, however, in
favour of Miss Violet Kingsley, who is a redeem-
ing feature in this visitation of Providence. The
second part of the programme was propped up to
some extent by her “ Silver Rhino,” but she was
incapable of supporting the weight of “ The Maid

performance in spite of her best attempts.

George Darrell did not exactly lift the
dramatic scalp of Brisbane during his season
there. The people of that city do not seem anxious
to come to the scratch for a double dose of Darrell.
Ihey are patient enough when George is playing
someone else s drama, or oven when his plays are
wrestled with by a cast which does not include
the versatile one, but the actor-author combina-
tion is rather too much. Consequently, “ Back

llenry C. Jarrett, the well-known American
theatrical manager, has just died. It is related that
when he took I ncle Tom’s Cabin ”to Europe—the first
time the play had been in England—Horace Weston,
the negro minstrel and banjoist
was one of the attractions.
While they were playing in
London, Weston—who is a real
negro and not a burned cork
specimen—seemed to arouse a
great deal of interest on the
part of the ladies in the best
society, and they used to write
sweet notes to him and entertain
him. One day Weston showed
Mr. Jarrett a lot of the perfumed
notes which he had received
from the English ladies. Jarrctt’s
quick eye spied a sheet of paper
with the royal coat of arms and
the date of Windsor Castle. He
quickly seized it and read it. It
was a command from the Queen’s
secretary to Weston to come to
Windsor, and play before her
Majesty. “My God!” ex-
claimed Jarrett, “when did this
come 1” ‘ • ’Bout tree weeks
ago,” said the negro. “ Good
heavens ! man, why didn’t you
show it to me ? Don’t you know
what this is?” demanded Jarrett.
“No, boss ; I ’sposed it was one
o’ dem ma-h letters.” “ Why,
you idiot, this is a command
to appear before the Queen.
You have thrown away the
biggest chance you’ll ever get.
It would have been thousands
of dollars for all of us.” And
so it would. But it was too late.

The famous contralto, Al-

on the Continent, according to

Prof. Chaincy, the spiritualistic lecturer
from Amurrika, is endeavouring to found a
Psychic School for Children in Melbourne. We
don’tknow whether the doctor’s treatment includes
a spoonful of jam after the physic, but otherwise
the little scholars are certain to play “ the wag ”
pretty freely. There is nothing, though, like
taking to spiritualism early in life. Train up a
child in the way he should go, and when he grows
up he can write ghostly messages on a slate, and
float around the room with a table on his head.
As regards the Professor, we fancy that his corres-
pondence with dead Tins is limited, but he is in
active communication with the angels. ’Twas in
a trance that a heavenly star descended upon his
forehead, and a celestial voice preached him a
spiritualist sermcfti. We know this is right, be-
cause we have heard with our own ears the
angelic message. Alas! the doctor reads it from
a manuscript. We expected to see him put
halo on his head, and repeat the blessed wore
with his eyes shut.

Messrs. Brough and Boucicault have mad
a promising start at the Melbourne Opera House
There is a decided air of all-round high-classisl
ness about their show. The company is clever
the scenic artist appears to be a man of taste lik
ourselves, and the orchestra is under the manage
ment of Mr. E. Stanislaus, whose name guarantee
good w r ork. The overture, in fact, is an importan
feature in the bill of fare. ‘‘Turned Up,” wit
which the B.’s are opening their campaign, is
three-act farce very fresh from London. It draw
there and will draw here. It abounds in comi
situations and “suggestion.” The latter is s
lightly handled by the principals that one forget
to be shocked. One laughs the laugh of innocenc
—such as innocence is nowadays—from start t
very nearly the finish. Nevertheless, “Turnec
Up” is neither witty nor improving. It is just j
success. The now people, whom Messrs. ii. am
H. have imported under a year's engagement, al
lind favour. Mr. E. W. Royco, as an old sea
captain witli enlarged views on connubiality, i
excellent. The Melbourne people have “cot
toned” to him right oil’, and they don’t know hal
Ids good qualities yet. Royce, in a “ break
down,” is, or used to be, very superior indeed. Ii
Mr. Walter Everard we have a jeunpreviier who i
likely to take up a prominent position in many
maidens’ dreams. With a good appearance anc
easy, rattling style Mr. E. combines something so
like talent that it is difficult to tell the difference
from a dress-circle seat. Miss E. Romer fills in
small part with the finish to bo expected of a lady
whose name was very familiar to the ears o
London playgoers some years fa go. Of (he other
now-chums in this company, Mr. George Las!
Gordon deserves notice as being an author-actor—
like George Darrell, donchcrknow. Mr. Gordon’s
part in “ Turned Up ” doesn’t test his capabilities
as an actor, but wo are inclined to jump to the
conclusion that he writes better than ho acts
The question must remain in abeyance until one
of his works is produced. Mr. Robert Rrough, in
an ultra-farcical character, is popular as ever, anc
Miss Trevelyan playing with more “go” than she
has previously exhibited, relieves the prevailing
absurdity of the seeno with some clever touches o;
comedy. “Turned Up,” thanks to its company
looks like lasting for another two or three weeks.
This, too, in face of the fact that business is uu
commonly quiet at the other Melbourne houses.

Minnie Palmer appears, and the gilded youth wil

Speaking of the revival of “ Unde Dick’s
Darling” at the Alexandra Theatre, Melbourne,
the Herald saysThe advantage of a lady
manageress will be apparent in the more natural
style of acting among the young ladies of melo-
drama.” Is that intended as “jam” for the
manageress, or a slap for those young ladies?
Anyway, it is ghastly rubbish. We shall expect
to hear next that the personal influence of the
Triumvirate is distinctly visible in Mr. Elton’s
impersonation of Ben Barnacle.

A very startling and novel entertain*
ment was advertised in Wellington, N.E., when
the mail left. Sixteen Maoris were placarded to
appear at the Theatre Royal to dance a native
dance, dressed, as stated in the advertisement, in
the “ancient Maori garb, which the white people
have never yet seen.” This is sure to draw a
crowded house, as there are several charming
wahines in the company, and when dressed in the
way indicated by the advertisement old father
Adam and Worth combined could not possibly
find fault with the fit. We would back Adam,
however, to be the best judge of the style.

By some inscrutable dispensation of Pro-
vidence the Australian parson who has retired
from active Sheol always takes to journalism, and
ay another dispensation he always seems to he _ a
'ailure in his new profession. _ The eloquent indi-
vidual who used to discourse so brilliantly in
Bethel about the left-hand thief, does not shine in
a capacity where people can contradict him. l He
is too apt to fall back on his old familiar argument
and tell the man who disagrees with him about
tuppence that he will bed and, and when he gets
riled he mixes up so much ox-gall with his ink
that people are inclined to fancy at times that he
lias put the whole ox into one bottle. In Queens-
land, since the Ist October seven clerical editors
have apologised abjectly for ferocious attacks
made on private citizens; one has apologised
twice over ; one is hiding in a coal-cellar on ac-
count of a Philistine with a cow-hide who is
roosting on his fence waiting for him to come out;
and another has gone away disguised as a
drunkard, and his return is anxiously awaited by
an Irishman who says that his own mother won t
know him when the excitement is over. Our
statistics regarding N.S.W. are not yet completed,
but we hope to publish them within a fortnight,
A feAV years ago Major Atkinson —a heart-
rending military clod who passes for a statesman
in N.Z.— had a striking inspiration on the subject
of mixed races. He pointed out in the Assembly
at Wellington that the 5000 Chinese then in the
The following extract re Sunday football is j
from the Essendon (Vic.) Chronicle. To bo
fully appreciated, it requires to be read slowly by
a cherubic Scotch individual with a fearful cold
in his doze :
“We never knew a man. woman, or club prosper who violated
the seventh day, and the Hotham first twenty can trace their
fast series of defeats to breaking a commandment whose
power is beyond the influence of puny man.”
Let us snuffle with a great and holy snuff. The
Hotham first twenty has offended the football
department of Providence and can’t kick straight
in consequence ; when a scrimmage is on, the law
and the prophets sit upon them and squash them
down, and when a member of the gang tries a run
he trips over the wreck of the Mosaic dispensation
and rolls over and great is the flop thereof. With
the whole solar system and a million systems be
sides to guide and control, the supreme power,
according to the Chronicle, spends its time
watching twenty mean and skinny boys kicking a
bladder covered with hide and takes a small re-
venge on them by making it bounce the wrong way.
In the good old times it would have been considered
sufficient to send these paltry sinners into ever-
lasting Sheol, but now things are changed, and as
a punishment for their offence they are not allowed
to kick in this world and are eternally kicked by a
red-hot demon in the next. Things are getting
very, very hot for the Sabbalh-breaker.

Anglo-Saxon blood by being gradually absorbed
into the white population, and stated that a little
foreign admixture would prevent the colonists
degenerating, and that one per cent, of dirty
mongrel heathen was just the proportion required.
He gave a hair-raising sniff when Sir George
Grey invited him to import one per cent, of every
race under the sun, from the Frenchman to the
Digger-Indian, and thereby make the hash com-
plete, and through lack of support the Major’s

however, thismongrelising process is going on gaily
and should lead to great results. In the Wide Bay

so much that he could only walk backwards.

haps half Australian native, and half German;
she has four husbands, who may be all of
different races though lumped together as
Polynesians, and the pedigree of her sons covers
one-third of the globe. The latter grow up as in-
telligent half-castes, and probably marry, girlfc of
European parentage, as a great many Polynesians
have done already, and the lineage of, the next
generation is past finding out. As for the girls of
the family, they perhaps disgrace themselves by
marrying Chinamen, or else revert to the Poly-
nesian stock and start afresh,, but if the process
goes on indefinitely a nation may arise : which.will

hybrid of real unadulterated i beastliness should;
be produced in the course of apother century, and
the colonist of the future. who traces his descent
from a half caste gin with four very much, mixed
husbands will break all known records in the
matter of ancestry,- Even in Britain very few
noble families haye been started byaman.withi

A JUBILEE JINGLE.
Sir Patrick smiled ; said he, “ I’ve got
A patriotic vein
As well developed as the one
l,n Bill they call the ‘ Plain ’ t
“■ Plain Bill may send Contingents out
r ifo slay the Soudanese
H ain’t a military bloke
Mv forte is Jubilees.
Let Roberts deal in malt and hops,
And Young in hops and halls
Let Ninian Melville deal in woe,
Shrouds, coffin-plates, and palls ;
“ If Parliament will only vote
The needful £ s. d.,
I’ll show Australia I’m the hoy
To run a Jubilee.
“ I’ll open railways everywhere,
Drains, pubs, (let niggards curse);
I’ll open wide that shrivelled sock
They call the Public Purse.
“ A fortnight’s howl—then darkness, debt,
Disaster, and D.T.
What odds 1 we’ll have a bully time,.
A high old Jubilee !”
Enough of Pat—he goes ahead
Of Bill they call the “ Plain ”—
He’d have the Lord’s Anointed out
To open up a drain !
He’d deafen Albert Edward with
A “ spaich” by Dan. O’C.,.
And butcher e’en the Royal ear
To make a Jubilee !,
Let Patrick and his programme slide,
We merely wish to state
We’ve got a programme of our own
for eighteen-eight y-eight..
One which (in all humilitee)
We humbly think will be
Much better than a fourteen-days’
Soul-satisfying spree.
We don’t want dilettante Dukes
(No, by the shade of Wilkes),
We don’t w'ant Lonsdales, Londesboroughs,
Or Battenbergs, or Dilkes ;
We don’t want Royal noses out
To sniff the Bondi breeze—
To Sheol with all princes, pimps,
Prigs, Jingoes, Jubilees !
We want some crying evils slain,
We want a little nous
Displayed both in and outside what
Sir ’Enery calls the ’Ouse.
We’d like the slogging business left
To Foley and to Lees ;
We don’t want fighting M.’sL.A.,
Or swilling Jubilees.
We’d like to see an Act in force
For alienating land—
One framed on rules of common sense
Which all can understand :
An Act to sooth the souls of both
Selector and lessee —
A better boon to cornstalks than
A Jennings Jubilee.
We like to give the lower class
A better boon than that—
Have no more Euclid taught ’e:n
With Wangles, and a CAT.
We’d like to see some judges taught
(Especially Judge D.)
To show a little mercy in
Our year of Jubilee.
We’d like to see the civil-list
Cut down (yes, by the mass!)
To something like proportion to
The wealth-creating class.
We’d like some sinecurists sacked
Who gorge ill-gotten fees —
A greater evil in their way
Than even Jubilees.
We’d like to see Protection strike
Its roots into the soil,
And make the hungry lean grow fat,
The poor man’s “ billy ” boil.
We’d tax dudes, dukes, and Chinamen,
Priests, parsons, C.M.G.’s,
And all who’d squander public cash
In senseless Jubilees.
PERSONAL ITEMS.
Mr. Dailey is, we are sorry to hear, again
very ill.
Mr. Peter Lalor, the Victorian Speaker,
is suffering from diabetes, and is on leave of
absence.
It is reported that Bishop Field Flowers
Goe, of Melbourne, has a brother named Wild
Flowers Goe.
Another huge scandal, with striking
points of resemblance to the Crawford-Dilke affair,
will shortly startle London town.
The Duke of Edinburgh has just com-
pleted his 42nd year. It will take him 42 years
more before he knows how to play the Addle.
“ Prince Louis of Battenberg has been
travelling about the Continent as Mr. Lewis
Brown.” Out of compliment to her Gracious, we
presume.
Sir John Robertson has been saying un-
pleasant things to the Mayor of Melbourne. It is
our duty to remind Honest Jack that the other
man is a lawyer.
Dilko, who leaves England for Australia
in a week or two, will—out of deference, we sup-
pose, to what he believes to be the custom of our
“ Arst families”—travel under an alias.
Henry George will be nominated as a can-
didate for the oAlce of Mayor of New York by the
Central Labour Union. We are sorry. Glutton’s
apoplexy would be a sad end for a philosopher.
We notice Mr. A. 0. Wylie, of Sydney,
barrister, is lecturing on “Political Economy.”
He was once secretary to Sir Charles Dilke ; so he
ought to have seen a good deal—if he kept his
eyes open.
Mr. Edmund Finn disclaims the author-
ship of “ The Priest’s Secret,” to which story
George Darrell is, or isn’t, indebted for the plot of
his latest play. Mr. Finn’s disclaimer comes
rather late in the day.
The Duke of Richmond draws from the
British, Treasury a “ perpetual pension” of £19,000
annually—simply because he happens to be
descended from; Louise Renee do Querouaille, a
mistress of Charles 11.
The Sydney Evening News, in its obituary
notice: of the late Theodore Emile Argles, grace-
fully alludes to that gifted writer as “ a literary
cheap Jack.” Bwt that’s not what was the matter.
Argles was mot cheap enough for the Bennetts.
•Judge Paul, of Queensland, passed through
Sydney last week after a trip to China and Japan,
undertaken for the sake of his health, which
has been much benefited. The Judge, it is under-
stood, now tells all his funny stories in Chinese.
Truth says Bishop Moorhouse originally
intended offering the vicarage of Blackburn to
Bishop Kennion, of Adelaide, instead of to Bishop
Pearson, of Newcastle, and hints that James
Manchester only changed his mind owing to the
storm of hostile criticism evoked by the proposal. •
Dr. Walter F. Mackenzie, who died of
peritonitis last week, had perhaps the largest pri-
vate practice in Sydney, and took with him to his
too early grave a vast store of medical experience.
In his capacity as chief medical officer of the
A.M.P. Society he had personally examined 25,000
people.
John James Williams, an ex-editor of the
Sydney War Crv, made his 59th appearance at
the Melbourne City Court last week on a charge
of drunkenness, and “ scratching and tearing at
his bare flesh ”in the public highway. John, we
believe, is the “saved reporter” who has fre-
quently “starred” at Harmy meetings.
A dashing young Spanish officer has got
into trouble for making love to Queen Regent
Christina. This is rough on the proud Castilian.
In the days of giddy Isabella a good-looking officer
didn’t run the same risks as now. The only diffi-
culty then was in making enough love to the
Queen- Isabella floated on the military.
The Prince of Wales’ tailor declines to
send him another suit of clothes until his bill i s
paid. It amounts to £lOOO, and has been running
for 25 years. In spite of his income of £150,000
per annum, Wales never pays anybody much, and
there is an occasional difficulty even about the
victualling department at Marlborough House.
The Queen’s affection for the noble family
of the Browns appears to be deep rooted. One of
her favourite faithful gillies is a certain Hugh
Brown, and the mantle of poor dear John has
just fallen upon a gentleman who is undoubtedly
brown by nature. Yes —Her Majesty has selected
a handsome Hindoo from Benares as her special
body servant.
Mr. Heath, of Daly River, S.A., when a
widower of 56 years, fell “ madly in love” with a
beautiful girl of 15 and married her. In her turn
she fell madly in love with one M'Kinnon, a beau-
tiful young man who was not 56. For wiping
Mac out with a pistol Heath has just got 10
years, and the married men of S.A. are agitating
for a mitigation.
A lordly commission agent of Napier,
N.Z., has just filed his little shovel with
liabilities in five figures and assets nil. At a
meeting of creditors it transpired that the unfor-
tunate filer had been earning about £1 a week and
living at the rate of £2OOO a year. Hard indeed
must be the conditions of life in a colony which
compels a poor devil to put up the shutters under
such circumstances.
The “unemployed” riots in London so
impressed Her Gracious, &c. that she playfully
observed, “ Perhaps there will be a revolution,
and 1 shall be driven from the throne.” In those
words is the explanation—if any were needed—of
(he Queen’s recent burst of activity. Her love
for the country is such that she would rather open
half-a-dozen shows, at enormous personal incon-
venience, than get the “ knock.”
Another tough flogging in Brisbane gaol-
only this time it was the new Governor of that
establishment, Captain Jekyll, who flogged
(horsewhipped) his predecessor, just to give him
something by which to remember the place where
he had spent so many happy hours. Captain Jekyll
(who, by the way, is an ex-imperial officer, and
went with the N.S. W. Contingent to the Soudan),
alleges that the other man had slandered Mrs.
Jekyll.
The saintly individual who tried to offer
up a prayer at the meeting of his creditors in
Auckland (N.Z.), some years ago, did not get as
far as “Amen” on that occasion. Among his
creditors was a rough Scotchman who, as soon as
he had got over his amazement at the coolness of
the proceeding, shouted out, “Sit doon, yo
domned infernel heepocreet ! If ye say anither
wurd to the Almichty in my presence dora me if I
dinna kick ye, &c., &c." The creditors roared,
and the petitioner sat down.
Who is “Mr. William Wilson, of Vic-
toria,” and why should we have to read a cable-
gram announcing his approaching departure from
England, and the fact that he is about to be
“banqueted”? Well, Mr. W. Wilson is a rich
and obscure person who hopes ultimately to sit in
the Commons. Mr. Wilson is suspected of having
provided much chicken and beer for the cable-
correspondents, and for the sum of one guinea we
are prepared to give in advance a list of the people
who will attend the Wilsonian banquet.
The reason why the newly-made “ Lord ’
Brassey, of Bulkeley, and his patrician “missus”
are coming to Australia seems to be that they are
desirous of giving the British public time to re-
cover from its astonishment at the recent an-
nouncement that Brassey’s real name is Be
Bressey, and that he is of ancient Norman stock,
dating at least fx-om the time of William the Con-
queror. The notification in question fairly took
away the breath of the 8.P., and his lordship has
hopes that when he gets back to England John
Bull will, in sporting phrase, have got his “second
wind.”
A Sydney publican, who has a reputation
as a “bruiser,” week told Mr. W. S. Targett,
M.L.A., “what he thought of him.” As he
didn’t got hit, he “said it again”—this time in
the street —and was promptly knocked down. He
arose and was knocked down once more, where-
upon he caved in. This aggressive publican, if he
had studied the newspapers attentively, would
not have made such a mistake —he would have
known that just now there are special reasons why
Mr. Targett should, better than any other man, be
able forcibly to illustrate the advantages of keep-
ing a still tongue.
“The officer in charge of the kitchen at
Darlinghurst Gaol has been reported to the Comp*
troller-General for a breach of discipline in giving
the murderer Reynolds a fried steak for his last
breakfast in this world.” We should think so.
The man who, while there w r as a gridiron under
Heaven to be begged, borrowed, or stolen, would
fry a steak, and delibei’ately administer >
to even a doomed murderer—the man who
could commit the cold-blooded, atrocious
cruelty of adding the weight of a f n *
steak to the heavy burden already borne by the
convicted wife-assassin—such a man deserves
die the death after he has sharpened his teeth fo
a month on the hash at our boarding-house.
According to the Sydney E. News, Car-
dinal Moran has written for the T. and C. JoCKMAh
a biography of Dr. Carr, the new R. C. Bishop 0
Melbourne. Considering that Alfred the Aw u

his Imminince wished to test the truth of

known Hebraic usurers, Mark Moss, Aaron Wax-
man, and David Henry, for £763, £l2O, and £216,
respectively. It is indeed strange that the know-
ledge officially acquired by Judge Noel in the In-
solvent Court was insufficient to make him refrain
from putting himself in the power of these
hook-nosed gentlemen. The worst aspect of
the affair presents itself when one reflects
that a judge would be scarcely human if he did
not slightly favour his creditors—especially such
creditors —in the business of the court. Judge
Noel’s salary was £l5OO a year.
The present Mayor of Melbourne (Mr.
Stewart) appears to be well beloved of his brother
turtle-consumers. They have paid him the
stupendous compliment of re-electing him for
another year of glory, to the exclusion of Alder-
man Benjamin, who happened to be spending his
Day of Atonement in retirement when the election
took place. This arrangement, it was considered,
would put the popular Stewart in the way of a
Jubilee knighthood. That gentleman, however, pro-
fesses indifference toaK.O.M.G.-ship, and declines
(at latest date) to wear the golden chain of office
for another 12 months. To complicate matters,
the bold Beniamin also declines to become a
Mayor at second hand, and the Council is in a
very disturbed state. Most of the aldermen have
wives, and every wife wants her old man to go
for the Jubilee knighthood. Anyway, it is satis-
factory to think that Mr. Benjamin will have none
of it. The Almighty never intended His chosen
people to be turned into K.C.M.G.’s.
We understand that many of our represen-
tative Australians were disturbed by an adver-
tisement in the London papers— “ Slater’s Detec-
tive Association have the most complete arrange-
ments possible for tracing missing friends and
suspected persons at the Colonial Exhibition.” The
appearance of that ad. considerably affected the
appearance of representative Australians. Some
were seized with a waggish mania for going to the
exhibition in blue spectacles and false noses, others
shaved off beards of 30 years’ standing, and wore
respirators. Two well-known C.M.Gs. met in the
N.S.W. Court, both wore false noses and flaxen
wigs, and each penetrated the other's disguise.
“ What are yvr, Bill —missin’ friend? ” “ Yes,
old man—and You ? ” “ Oh, I’m a ’spected person,”
was the sorrowful reply. A policeman hove in
sight, and the two C.M.G’s., silently shaking hands,
slunk behind a sheltering show-case. We can
vouch for the truth of that yarn. We have it
straight from a London correspondent, whoso
word is as good as his bond. Nay, better, for his
last bill was dishonoured.
Writes Mr. Charles Lett in the Sydney
E. News : —“ If Mr. Heaton can carry this cheap
postage measure he will have established a high
position for himself in the Imperial Parliament, as
well as a claim to be recognised as an authorita-
tive exponent of colonial opinion in a' future Con-
sirvative Government.” Mr. Charles Lett also
writes “ Miss Braddon’s new novel ‘ One Thing
Needful,’ which has hardly had time to reach
Sydney yet, has some amusing sketches of the
many-sided Grand Old Man, under the name of
Mr. Nestorious. One of the facets of character
skilfully presented by this distinguished novelist
is Mr. Gladstone’s capacity for falling in love.”
Apropos , whenever in London two real Tories
meet in a club the illicit and shocking amours of
Mr. Gladstone afford them a theme of conversa-
tion. But the fact remains that, though the
G.O.M. has a habit of beaming upon pretty girls as
he passes them in the street—Sir John Robertson,
by the way, also dispenses many pleasant grand-
fa 1 herly smiles upon the unknown fair—the Tories
have never yet been able to do anything more
than misconstrue his motives in shedding the
light of his countenance upon les petites appeti-
sanies.
Drs. Fitzgerald and Beaney, the eminent
Melbourne limb-removers, are at lance!s drawn
over tiie miserable hospital scandal. Beaney
heads the Parliamentary faction which desires to
keep the precious institution in the present condi-
tion, and wouldn’t willingly part with a single
germ. Fitz. speaks with the popular voice, and
says “ Burn it down ! ” Hence there was friction
when the latter came to give evidence before the
Enquiry Committee, with bashful Beaney in the
chair. A reference to the professional skill and
success of Dr. Fitz. was nearly attended with
fatal results —to Beaney. After getting the better
of his apoplectic symptoms he burst out ; “As
chairman it is not right for rao to say what opera-
tions I have done and to speak of my successes.”
Modest, retiring Beaney ! He should rather have
said that it wasn’t necessary to speak of his suc-
cessess. They receive bold advertisements in
newspaper paragraphs and at banquets. They
arc more dazzling than his diamonds. Often have
we revelled in a half-column history of the cutting
olf of somebody’s toe by “ our popular surgeon.”
Beaney can rest contented. So long as he con-
' Himes to buy diamonds and give big feeds his
fame will never die.
The murder is out at last. Baron Mik
lonho Maklay, of Sydney, is not a baron after ail ;
he is only a “ Potomstwenii Dworianine.” He
has been a Potomst shadow of the prophet!
whore has the other end of that name got to ? —he
has been a Poto-and-all-the-rest-of-the-unholy-
bosh ever since lie can remember, and his father
was a Pot before him. It is no fault of his ;
he was born that way. Nearly everybody in
Hussia who can spell decently is a Poto whisky—
or whatever it may be ; the title is about equiva-
lent to that Chinese distinction which looks like a
cat having a fit in a waste-paper basket, and it
simply signifies that the mother of the individual
alluded to is not reduced to take in washing to
support him. While on this subject, we may
mention that M. Maklay’s New Guinea scheme,
which wav beginning to look up again, has fizzled
once more. The Russian Government was induced
at last to give him some support, and a large
number of volunteers came forward, all willing
and anxious to emigrate to a laud which, like
Eden, grew everything, from sour apples, sin, and
shakes, down to murder and cannibalism. But
Poi.omst wennii D. Maklay blighted them in one act.

In the despotic, brutal, nigger-hanging,

than four times a year unless he has political in-
fluence. A fortnight ago Dominic Murphy had a
s P roe > refused to pay for a liquor, and u-ed some
strong language begotten of rum. Next morning
he was sober and had a terrible head ; he called
°n his enemy of the previous night, paid up, and
apologised. One shilling fine, 12s. expenses, a
month with hard labour, and a vicious reprimand
Were held to meet Dominic’s case, and on the
same morning five men who were found sheltering
mm the weather in some stables, got three months
Upiece. To a prisoner in W.A., hard labour means
laving his hair cut off, being badly fed, wearing a
convict dress, working in chains on the roads, and
Perhaps being flogged for insubordination.

Mr. Black, of the Brisbane Assembly,

A fact of which The Bulletin has reason

“Editor Bulletin.—Sir, —ln your issue

of this week there is a paragraph one of the many
errors of which I wish to correct as the error m

When I interjected *He biats his wife ’ Mr.

“ The policy of the Government,” said the
N.S.W. Premier a few nights ago, “is one of
economy and retrenchment.” Yet in the Supple-
mentary Estimates the sum of £7835 18s. 2d. is
required for a portion of the salaries of new
officials in the Civil Service, nearly all of whom
have been appointed within the last six months.
Sir S. W. Griffith says that although he
has applied personally to the President of the
feydney Geographical Society, he can obtain no
satisfactory explanation with reference to the sum
of £lOOO contributed by Queensland to the Bverill
expedition to New Guinea. He has sternly de-
termined that Queensland won’t be “ had ” in that
way again.
Sir S. W. Griffith cruelly remarked in the
Brisbane Assembly last week that he hoped
members had not followed him for favours in the
way of votes which they expected to receive. Sir
Sami veil s hope is justified. Members follow him
for the same reason that they used to support Sir
Henry Parkes and Sir A. Stuart in N.S.W.—they
are fascinated by the charms of his conspicuous
beauty and virtue.
The Legislative Council of Queensland,
true to all the traditions of the Conservatism
which rules such chambers, threw out that clause
of the Employers’ Liability Bill which provides for
compensation to seamen injured by accidents
caused by rotten tackle on board ship. And the
S. A. Legislative Council has by 10 votes to 5
thrown out tho Payment of Members bill. A poli-
tical Hades is gaping for those colonial lords.
“ It is announced that a .working-man’s

It is more than hinted that tho arrest and
deposition of Prince Alexander of Bulgaria was
nothing bit a “barney” pre-arranged between
him and the wire-pullers at St. Petersburg. The
leisurely way in which he returned to his sorrow-

voluntary abdication are suggestive of the acco-
modating Battenbcrg having been “ squared.” No
other member of the family has ever loosened his
grip on a good thing. *
The song of Sir Patrick Jennings. From
the Cumberland Times :
“ Our tyrannous authority
We deftly exercise ;
Our subsidised majority
All common-sense despise ;
Our blubber brain and brazen cheek
All opposition dare,
For we’re a brutal Ministry,
We are, we are, we air.”
The other day a member of the firm to
which Mr. H. 11. Brown, M.P.,belongs, got into a
little trouble, and since then Mr. Brown seems to
have felt more kindly towards the Government
than he used to do. Judging from his votes he
now thinks a £2,000,000 shortage rather a nice
thing, and regards Jennings as a jolly good fellow
who deserves support. Of course this is only a
coincidence. We have seen so many
such affairs in N.S.W. that we can
now smell a coincidence a mile off.
London Echo, commenting on
the Australian yell for the annexa-
tion of the New Hebrides and the
Canadian demands re fisheries dis-
pute, asserts that both colonies de-
sire more than England can give,
and that such demands show the
great danger of continued mainten-
ance of the union of Great Britain
and her larger colonies. This is gall
for the Imperial Foderationists. These
demands are not a circumstance to
those which would be made if a closer
union were consummated.
“It is an
unlucky coinci
dence that the

of N.S.W., or

have chosen to

a blatant dema-
gogue of the
worst type.

are, of course, from the Australa-
sian.
In Belgium, some young girls
work in the coal mines from 5 a m.
to 11 pan. and earn the magnificent
wage of Is. Bd. per day, and in other
trades they are paid on a similar
scale. Thanks to British Free-trade,
Belgian goods manufactured under
this system are largely exported
into England, and the English work-
man will some day require to labour
under similar conditions unless Pro-
tection comes to his relief. In trade
it is the cheapest, not the fittest,
which survives, and the Belgian
mechanic, with his 12s. or 14s. a week
for 16 hours’ daily labour, must
necessarily outlast the Englishman.
In re the two big Sydney boot-sellers who,
though they manufacture, say they can do
without protection. Mr. Wright, of Sydney,
who is a bona-fide manufacturer, and not an impor-
ter, joints out that one of these advocates of free-
trade sells four times as many English boots as he
does colonial ones ; while, with regard to the other
flym, it js an open secret that one partner is living
in Europe superintending the manufacture and
purchase of English and foreign boots designed for
the Sydney market. Under which circumstances
it is not difficult to understand why they do not
want protection.
Britain is still doing a great work of re
generation in Egypt, that miserable countiy
to farther enslave which N.S.W. lent her inglorious
little crew of bandits. There is now a court of ap-
peal in that unhappy land, with ten English
judges, and there is so little to do that they all go
away for a holiday at once, and nobody misses
them. Then tfiere are 28 officials who draw over
£l9OO a year each, and out of these 22 are per-
petually on leave, and everything is adjourned
I ex cepfc their salaries. The whole squad Costs
j Egypt £400,000 a year, and the natives, at £1 a
I week, do the work.
There are in Great Britain 810,, 000 paU-
pers, or one out of 30 of the total population.
Annually there are 180,000 apprehensions for
drunkenness. There are in England and Wales
500,000 drunkards, 350,000 barmen and barmaids,
and 150,000 publicans and bettr-sellers, and the
country’s annual drink-bill is £150,000,000. “ Mis-
sions to the heathen ” merely mean the spread of
disease and drunkenness among the blacks for the
benefit of the whites; yet England sends away
annually £1,316,798 in such missions, as against
about £lOO,OOO similarly employed by Germany,
£12,000 by France, or £193,533 for the whole of
Europe!
Ilev. Missionary Patou is now on a New
Hebrides crusade in Queensland. He lectured
recently at Gyrapie, with a captain—a man of
blood—in the chair, and pointed out that “ French
civilisation ” meant disaster and death to tl e
natives of the islands, whereas annexation by
Britain would save their immortal souls as well as
their bodies. He omitted to mention, of course*
that in Fiji, during 10 years of British govern-
ment, the aborigines have declined from 220,003
to 105,000, all told, and that there is every reason
to fear the missing 115,000 are in Sheol, but that
was a very small matter. It is gratifying to learn
that in the New Hebrides 20,000 of the natives
have been so far civilised as to wear ‘‘ more or
less clothing.” We guess, however, that they
mostly wear loss—a good deal less.
After his great speech on the N.S.W
£2,000,000 deficit, Sir Henry Parkes will not go
down to posterity as a big authority on finance.
With a shortage equal to one-quarter of a year’s
revenue the affairs of the colony are bad enough,
but the great “ Hi Ham ” only showed his miser-
able ignorance, or some other quality more miser-
able still, when ho declared that the position of
N.S.W. would be akin to that of Britain if the
latter country showed a revenue deficiency
for the year of some £22,000,000. He
chose to utterly ignore the fact that N.S.W.
has assets of almost untold value—assets which
only require to be rightly used to yield an im-
mense return, while Britain has hardly enough to
show for her load of debt to pay for a section in
Kurt’s Arcadia. Britain has no Crown lands to
sell, she has no railways that are not in private
hands; she has nothing but a collection of obso-
lete glory, but let her rejoice all the same.
Providence has been good to her, for she has no
Parkes.
Writing to a London paper, Mr. George
Kimber, of Timaru, implores the editor to give
him room to show up the abominable tricks of par-
sons and other humbugs in England, who are try-
ing to delude the poverty-stricken labourers into
emigrating to N. Z. He declares that that colony
is in a hopeless state of destitution, that its poverty
has been increasing every year until it is now in a
condition baft! ing description. He considers the
N.Z. Government is the greatest fraudever imposed
on a suffering people. It has smuggled the land,
all except swamps and mountain-tops, and divided
the spoil. It has borrowed thirty millions to im-
prove the stolen lands, and spent them on railways
and immigration, by which ten families have pro-
fited to the extent of twenty millions. There is a
landed aristocracy of 250 who are lords of all New
Zealand. The colony is a great usury den—every-
body and everything is mortgaged beyond redemp-
tion. These and other hard tacks George hammers
home for the benefit of the sons of toil in the old
country, so that if they are foolish enough to emi-
grate they may do so with their eyes open.
The Bulletin is responsible for a good
deal of the following, quoted from an article in
our pages by London Truth ; but, oh ! how little
are our gods known in England ! Who are
“Graham, Baring, or Mr. Dalby ?” However, let
Truth speak:—“The gang of colonials who are
being fed and lionised about the country, and ex-
plaining everywhere that the vast lands from
which they come .are peopled by flunkeys and
sycophants, do not, as is usually the case with
prophets, find a very hearty appreciation at home.
Says The Bulletin, the newspaper which has the
largest circulation in Australia :
“ ‘ The mere circumstance of titles being conferred on such
men as Graham, Baring, and Robert Stout serves to open the
eyes of the colonists to the fact that honours are distributed,
not to those who have served Australasia well and truly, but
to such as promise to be pliant instruments in the hands of
London lords and princelings. Mr. Dalby, the new Privy
Councillor, has long since lost all claim- if he ever possessed
any—to rank as a representative Australian. To the future
Australian the political bigotry which is now termed loyalty
will be as incomprehensible as the mysteries of Obi. It is
the dream of madmen that this great continent should ever
consent to be bound to the festering corpse of Monarchy,
and should obey for ever an absent and invisible sovereign,
who claims its allegiance on the score of ti aditions whirl)
grew in dark ages at the remote Antipodes. In times to
come we shall stand amazed that such a man should have
built up a European reputation on the attempted butchery
of a few brave but badly-armed patriots in the Soudan.’”
From all of which it is pretty evident that the
circulation in England of Plain Bill Dailey and
Graham Berry is not yet quite so big as that of
The Bulletin.
Apropos to the letter of “ James *Greig, a
Loyalist,” who writes to The Bulletin from Balla-
rat. Even in England the majority of electors are
now in favour of granting self-government to th.e
Irish people. The constituencies are strangely
mixed, in some places 20,000 voters having one
member only, while in others 2000 are equally
represented. Mr. Gladstone’s supporters are re-
turred almost exclusively by the large towns,
while his opponents r.ely greatly on tire villages,
where the brutal hoglike Hodge votes as he is jtold
and fancies beer will go down in price as the re-
ward of his docility. During the last elections,
when 512 members had been returned, it was
found that the Liberal leader had only 196 fol-
lowers, while the Tories and Unionists mustered
316, but Mr. Gladstone’s 191? had sent in by
1,350,336 votes, while the opposing .31Q were backed
up by 1,106,651 only. Dividing the votes given by
the number of members, each supporter of Home
Rule had 6590 suffrages, while each opponent
averaged only 3502. Had represent ition gone
according to population only, Mr. Gladstone would
have mustered 282 supporters to Salisbury’s 230,
and as the latter number would have consisted
largely of Unionists who support the Tories on
Irish questions only, it follows tjhat of the real
Conservative party—the fossil .clods who graze
like their own fat oxen on the lands of the nation
—hardly a vestige would have remained. The
struggle is one of mind against matter, but the
inert hereditary louts who now hold the reins of
power are supported only by an ignorant and
clownish minority after all. Numbers and brains
are both against them, and the average country
Tory—a mere over-fed mass of beef —cannot stand
long against such a combination.

We would like to let Lord Caringtou know
in our own private and unostentatious way that
there are a lot of impudent people who affect to
think that Government House, Sydney, and (say)
£lB,OOO a year are not given him with the sole ob-
ject that “ the show ” should be run in the interests
of English globe-trotters. H.E. may not be aware
of it, but his dinner-parties are supposed by the
presumptuous individuals aforesaid to be given to
Australians no less than to dudes from “home.”
H.E. gained some reputation for hospitality, com-
ing as he did after the venerable hen-fancier, but
he will lose ground by not making a greater fuss
over the people who pay him a “ splendid screw”
to “ entertain on.” “ Thursday afternoons,” when
there is a wild revelry of tea and tennis, is much ;
but not enough by any means. Though Lord
Hisgustus did not entertain Sydney people, neither
did he hunt up every youngster who landed at
Circular Quay and make him a welcome guest!
* * *
But we knew it would soon come. His
Excellency, it is plain, is already pretty tired of
being eternally pump-handled by colonial “ sas-
siety.” A man can’t suddenly turn his back on
the associations of a life-time without feeling the
jar acutely, and so we don’t greatly blame his
lordship after all for much preferring the com-
pany of an eye-glassed person with check pants, a
patrician drawl, and a Piccadilly “manner” to
that of the gilded bourgeois and the opulent ex-
bullock-persuader who has managed to gain a
title manufactured expressly for exportation.
* * *
Melbourne ladies are anxiously enquiring
whether anybody can tip Lady Carington’s cos-
tume for the Cup.
* * *
The Wollongong people are already in a
state of excitement over the visit which his
Excellency is to pay to their township. The event
is not to come off till February, so that this out-
burst of exuberance is a little prema
ture, but it is always best to be in good time. The
visit is to be signalised by a flower-show, the
opening of a Town-hall, and all the customary
antediluvian fuss.
* *
Between 300 and 400 people, including a
large number of Melbourne visitors and Sydney
fashionables, responded to the invitation of Sir
Patrick and Lady Jennings to an afternoon party
at their residence, Colcbrook, Double Bay, on
Friday, 15th. Tents had been erected in the
garden, where refreshments were spread, but the
rain prevented any out-door amusements. Jubilee
municipalists, however, prefer indoor amusements.
Several lady vocalists entertained the company
with some well-rendered songs, the ballroom being
sot aside as a music-room. Lady Jennings wore
a handsome costume of black satin with rich lace
draperies. She received her guests in the draw-
ing-room, and amongst them were noticed, from
Melbourne : Mr. and Mrs. Carter, Mr. and Mrs.
Ham, Mr. and Mrs. Alcock, Mr. and Mrs. God-
fred, Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Mr. Stewart, Mrs. C.
Smith, and many others. There were also present
Admiral Tryon, Sir Edward Strickland, Judge
Faucett, Mayor Young and Miss Young, Mr.
and Mrs. Hardy, Mr. and Mrs. O’Connor, Colonel
Airey, Colonel Roberts, the Hons. Dibbs, Cope-
land, and Lyne, &c.
* * *
In somewhat bad taste, the Globe gives
further publicity to the admiration so loudly ex-
pressed for Lady Carington by the aldermen,
&c., (Mayor Young’s “ Jubilee ” guests), who
were received at Government House, Sydney,
last week. It seems to have originally been
Lord Carington’s intention to entertain these fat
personages outside in the yard, or among the trees,
and invitations were issued accordingly, but most
unfortunately for her ladyship’s carpets, heavy
rain came down, and the turtle-fed company had
to be asked inside. Apropos, it is related that
several municipal magnates, who have lately in-
flicted their presence upon a certain rather
“swagger” Sydney hash-foundry, complain
bitterly of the treatment to which they have been
subjected. The mistress of the house, it seems,
actually asked them to take off their
hats while sitting in the drawing-room;
further, she had the impertinence to re-
quest that they would neither smoke nor ex-
pectorate in her “best” apartment, “Sydney
society,” these gorgeous individuals complain, is
so confoundedly “ stiff.” One or two of them, on
leaving the ultra-conventional hostelry in ques-
tion, still continued to argue the hat-question,
stoutly contending that it was quite en regie
for a gentleman to wear his “tile” in the house,
always provided he doffed it at meal times. The
Idea is a peculiarly aldermanic one, and is charm-
ingly typical of that large Town-hall-fed body
which has no respect for anything but beer and
beef.

At St. Stephen’s, Elsternwick, Melb., on
12th October, Rev. A. Pelham Chase, second son
of Canon Chase, was married to the only daughter
■of Mr. Theyro Weigall. The church was florally
decorated —chiefly with lilies and marguerites.
The bride, who was given away by her father,
wore a very long trained gown of ivory satin
merveilleux, richly draped with cream lace ; the
customary wreath and veil, with a large bouquet,
completed a most becoming toilette. The two
bridesmaids were attired alike in embroidered
muslin with sailor hats. The newly-married
couple will reside at Sorrento, where the bride-
groom has been appointed to the living.

On Thursday last, in Melbourne, Miss
Beatrice Stephen was married to Colonel Bing-
ham. R.A., of Sydney. It was a very smart
wedding, and the pretty bride perhaps never
looked better than on her marriage morn. She
Wore a lovely cream satin gown with train fully
three yards long, and was attended by two little
pages in white satin and by eight little brides-
maids —her nieces and nephews.

On Tuesday afternoon, the 12th inst.,
Mayor and Mayoress of Sydney held a reception
•at the Town Hall, when quite 500 guests attended.
The visitors in connection with the alleged muni-
cipal “jubilee” were also present. Substantial
refreshments were provided to meet the substan-
tial jubilee appitites of the municipalists, and
Herr Patok’s band played several tunes during the
afternoon.

Sydixey, on 13th inst. Smoke dx-aws more soldiers
than fire. Pipe-Major M‘Donald played his own

pipes. The effect was electrifying. The whole
affair was very national, and we know what that
means. We defy anybody to write a neater libel

They affect theatricals in Bathurst, and
knowing that all the world’s a stage, fancy all its
inhabitants are players. That is a mistake they
have been led into by our fi-iend William. But in
extenuation of his folly in making such a statement
it must be remembered that Bathurst was in the
age of niggers and ’possum-eating at the time he
wrote. Had it been otherwise, the wily bard
would have run an exception into his state-

falling into this natural mistake. All the

cure the greatest comfort for Sir Charles. Nonecf his
little pleasures are to be denied him, and even a
Queen’s Proctor is to be appointed in case any
necessity should arise for his services. Captain
Foster, it is thought, will not be of the party ;
while Mrs. Crawford has, we regret to learn,
defiantly determined to remain on the “ Conti -
nong.” All this is a sad blow, and detracts
greatly from the show; still the sight will be a
good one, and Potts Point will have an oppor-
tunity of entertaining this distinguished baronet —
son, by the way of a gardener who was so fortunate
as to be friend of Albert the well-paid.

Most people are aware of the fact that Dilke
was in this part of the world years ago, and that
he is the author of “ Greater Britain.”

A prominent Sydney speculator, whose figure
andmoustachios are well-known in fashionable ball-
rooms, last week unsuccessfully attempted to hold
out a siege. A creditor having got judgment
against him, issued a fifa, and a sheriff’s officer
■ was sent in search of the delinquent to demand
payment. After many fruitless attempts at an
interview, the man of law eventually ran his
quarry to his office in street. There the im-
pecunious one locked himself in and paid a deaf
ear to the passionate appeals of the sheriff s man
to “come out and not make a fool of himself.”
The bailiff, however, was not to be “ done.” He
placed a cordon round the building, and loudly
declared his intention of waiting a week, if neces-
sary, rather than let his man escape. As night-
time drew.on, the gay speculator, seeing that the
game was up, came forth and affably tried to ex-
plain that the whole thing was a mistake, don’t-
cherknow, and that at present ho was unable to
meet the pressing little demand —a matter of a
cool £ll,OOO or so.

too deeply steeped in double-charges to be led to
the golden shore of piety by even 22,281 bouquets.
It will take more than 22,281 bouquets to lift a

Rev. Osborne Lilley—beautiful name—
preached in Brisbane on Sunday week on “ Court-
ship.” If the clergy would but chiefly confine
their oratory to subjects of this character, the world
would stand a much better chance of profiting by
their ministrations than it does at present. Much
miscellaneous practice in the art of courtship is
believed to be acquired by the meek curate, and
even by the elderly shepherd, while visiting the
ewes of the flock —in a word, it can be safely said
with respect to courtship, that many of the stipen-
diary saints of the community practise even more
than they dare to preach.

Unprejudiced critics are bringing back
very indifferent accounts of the Indian and Colo-
nial Exhibition. They describe it as a dreary, ill-
arranged show, frequented by a crowd of mock
enthusiasts.

In these hard times it is necessary to do
something desperate to raise the wind, and an
English Arm has therefore hired a lady as com-
mercial traveller with very good results. She is a
pretty, slender little woman with a peach-bloom
complexion,and a charming blush, andisasinnocent
looking as an angel, but beneath this lovely ex-
terior she has the cheek of a brass-plated whale
and the energy of a 10-horse power mother-in-law.
She travels second-class, and charges first-class
fares in the regulation style ; she debits her Arm
with cab-fares, and then trusts to her little trotters
cased in No. 1 hoof-boxes just as a man does, and
now and then she lets a customer give her a kis7.
That always means a big order. She puts up, too,
at hotels kept by elderly widowers and makes love
to them, thereby dodging many a bill which
figures in her expenses account, and with her
silvery little voice she can talk an order out of a
Hebrew corpse. Altogether the rights of woman
are looking up.

Taken all in all, perhaps the most elaborate
personage among Mayor Young’s gorgeous array
of Jubilee aldermen is the Mayor of Ballarat,
whose civic dignity is of so superior and exacting
a description as to necessitate the almost constant
presence of a uniformed beadle at his worship’s
—we had nearly said his lordship’s—elbow. The
rare intervals in which this splendid flunkey—
expressly imported from Ballarat for the occasion
—is not engaged in combing out the eyebrows of
his distinguished master, straightening his golden
bullock-chain of office, or sewing the most delicate
lace (at eight guineas a yard) on to the border of
his best catskin robe- are, we understand, devoted
to inditing replies to innumerable little notes on
scented pink paper sent him, the magnificent
beadle aforesaid, by the enchanted fair of Sydney.
The Right Worshipful Mr. Davies, Lord Mayor of
Hobart, seems to be travelling flunkeyless and in
a comparatively unostentatious manner, yet is ho
likewise an individual of much catskin and bul-
lock-chain. It is rumoured that his lordship,
though privately he gives expression to some little
annoyance at the undemonstrative manner in
which he has been received by his brethren of the
local Press, is not altogether displeased with the
little he has seen of Sydney.

Alfred Allen, Esq.—Alfred, by the way,
is, in N.S.W., a most unfortunate name—“ slung’’
an ode on the occasion of the opening of the recent
Waverley flower-show, and delivered it before the
visitors in a style that set them wondering in
which character he appeared to least advantage
that of the poet, or that of the reciter. The third
stanza in the “pome” informed Alfred’s victims
that—
“ The sky above is clear to-day,
And summer dawns upon the land
the joke being that while the bard was enuncia-
ting the words the rain was coming down by
buckets-full. A little further along in the poem
the “ Eastern slopes ” round Coogec way came in
for a blasting breath of praise, special mention
being made of the “enchanting woods where
lovers rove.” This was probably meant as a deli-
cate allusion to the episode of the amorous Nor-
wegian sailor who was flogged some time ago.
However, so long as Mr. Allen confined himself
to plain undiluted drivel his hearers tolerated it,
but when he descended to grovel, the people
looked as if they wanted to tear up the Ben
Buckler rock and throw it at him. Digging his
heels into the platform and favouring the vice-
regal party with a smile which would have warped
a tram-line, the poet proceeded
“ Good Carington has come—the people’s choice.
The throng is still to hear his manly voice
Tell how his Queen—beloved by all mankind,
Would well be pleased all loyal hearts to bind
With one long fadeless wreath, from shore to shore,
Till strife t hould cease, and war should be no more.”
“ Good Carington ! ” Good Heavens ! “ The peo-
ple’s choice ! ” What can Alfred mean ?

Last year, in N.S.W., 59 persons are
known to have committed suicide. The year 1878
was the least suicidal of the decade just past, for
in it only i 8 men and women took the chance as
to what dreams might come in their sleep of death.
Of the aforesaid 59 suicides, 52 were men, and
only seven women —the latter of whom all
poisoned themselves. Of the men, It chose
drowning, nine poison, and 12 hanging. The
hottest months showed the highest records.

The story goes that one high-bred lady
would have given all her old boots to have been
the bride at a recent haul ton Australian widding ;
she was so deeply attached to the groom that she
had perforce to flee to Europe ere the fatal knot
was tied.

Kidnapping is the order of the day in
Melbourne just now. Only a few days ago a
child, three years of age, was coolly stolen out of
a perambulator in one of the busiest streets in
Collingwood whilst its mother was in a shop
driving the assistants frantic in their wild endea-
vours to find something “ just a shade lighter.”
What the thieves want the children for is just
now beyond comprehension, but the mystery will
no doubt be ultimately solved. Many years ago,
in London, it was noticed with surprise not
wholly unmixed with satisfaction, that the Italian
organ-grinders had become scarce, and great was
people’s joy thereat, until one day a thieves’ den
was raided by the police, and the remains of 17
children of the land of song were found buried in
one room. All these had been murdered for the
sake of their teeth, and this is probably one rea-
son why Australian speculators grew so shy of a
home-trip with a team of aboriginal cricketers.

There was trouble at Tarana (N.S.W.),
recently, when two parties of excursionists found
that there were only buggies enough to carry half
of their joint number to Jenolan. One party con-
sisted of saints of the parson species, the other o.
sinners of just about the average quality. True
to their own teaching, the parsons had taken “ no
thought for the morrow,” and had not imitated
the sinners in wiring for buggies, but as soon as
the train hove to, the saints gripped their impedi-
menta (sinful things of this world such as Glad-
stones and portmanteaux) and went for those
buggies a? a covetous alligator goes for the suc-
culent calf. That’s how the row began. 'l llO
worldlings clearly were entitled to the traps—the
salt of the earth were as clearly in possession, and
there was no one to enforce the writ of ejectment.
The former party appealed to their reverences
honour, and the parsons calmly replied that they
had left it all at home ; then they appealed to
them as gentlemen, hut the hitter sarcasm m-
volved merely stirred up natural resentment. So
after a delay of a couple of hours, the worldlings
suffered the buggies to go on, for they saw the
signs of rain and storm were sitting on the moun-
tain brow and the road was long and rough.
The sinners stayed in comfortable quarters a
Tarana while the clergy went on, and were me
by rain and icy wind which so sharpened their
appetites that whenever they left the table alter
meals during the trip there was nothing else tha
they could leave except the cruets and spoons-
From the conduct of these good men it is though
they were a set of clerical Pooh-Bahs who wished)
by ripping up the religious and social code, to
humiliate that pride which under the form of sel ■
righteousness has lived with the parson family t°
generations.

Editor Bulletin.—Sir, —lt is my iruS "
fortune to have to travel the country for bream
There is no little Pedlington from Dan to Beer
sheba in which my tent has not been pitche
and from the force of early associations I have
habit of going to church whenever I have on an)


thing new that fits me. I get along with the
Amening, &c., rightly enough, wondering what
there will be for dinner, peacefully and reverently
like a churchwarden. lam not going to make
fun of the parson, poor devil —it's not so very rosy a
game, struggling to look pious and spiritual in
public on a sweltering day in spite (f a 11-stone
body and a countenance oily and broad with the
humour of preaching resignation to a nodding
congregation already too near the borders of con-
tentment. No, the parson I have become accus-
tomed to, but the choir makes me shudder. O,
dear girls, eschew the choir ! It will never bring
you a husband ! As soon as you begin to wear
long dresses cease, I implore you, to sing in pub-
lic. Although I know quite well that you are
singing t 6 the praise and glory and all that, the
young marrying men don’t. They say you are
screaming for notoriety and for something to
marry. Besides, very few women can scream
eloquently (without their hands tangling in some-
body’s hair), and you are not one of the few. And
the assisting to ape the customs of great European
churches, which have facilities for making the
musical part of the Church service a treat, brings
you Into ridicule, and is an insult to the musical
taste of the bulk of the congregation, who, indivi-
dually, it is probable, would do less well than do
you ; but then, perhaps, each has the delicacy to
refrain from attempting to do what they see is in
your case so pretentious a failure. I know you
will forgive me the truth I am speaking, and I
think sufficiently well of you to hope that you
will help in persuading your simpler sisters to sit
in the body of Ihe church, and discontinue
their frantic efforts to bring their small accom-
plishments before the public and possible suitors.
Sing by all means if you must, but let it be beside
the tea-kettle, dear, until you have learned—if
ever you can—how painfully funny the “ singing
of the choir” is in the ears of all who have heard
singers sing.—Dubbo.

There was presence of min I shown in the
case of the young lady who sat in an alcove at
an evening party with a fascinating young mili-
tary man, her little niece on her knee to play
propriety. Suddenly the company was electrified
by the exclamation of the child : —“ Kiss me, too,
Aunt Alice! ” But the sudden shock was suc-
ceeded by a feeling of relief, as Alice
calmly replied—“ You should not say, ‘ Kiss me
two, dear ; you should say, “ Kiss me twice.’ ”

This story is about a girl named Bridget.
She was a slavey and wielded the dish-clout in a
Victorian back settlement, but she was also a
oney young lady when it was her day out, and
she resolved to go as “ Australia” to a fancy dress
ball. So she waited on a local artist and called
for tenders for painting a dress all over with emus,
kangaroos, and sich. The lowest offer, £3 35.,
was, however, beyond her means, and at last she
arranged to pay 12s. Gd. and get as much live-
stock as could be thrown in for the money. The
result was one thin and bilious-looking kangaroo,
one sheep in the last stage of emaciation, and a
wizened lamb that had been apparently born old.
This was hardly enough to travel on as “ Aus-
tralia,” but Bridget was equal to the emergency
she went as “The Destroying Drought.”

When are we going to have cremation in
Australia ? This question is asked because the
writer was the other day shown the bill for the
burial of a poor man whose inexperienced rela-
tives, overwhelmed with grief at their loss, had
permitted the undertaker to have carte blanche in
the matter. The amount demanded was £27 10s ,
and the bill ran thus '
To coffin covered with superfine 15. cloth and mounted
with registered furniture, linings, and rnftiea &c. ; use ol
state hearse, with urns complete, three mourning coaches,
eight advts., grave fees, and undertaker's attendance, &c.,
All 10s.
Nor was this all. The grave-site (£6 65.) had to
be paid for, and there were in addition the clergy-
man's fee, and so on. By the way, Dr. Cremation
Creed will be interested to know that the Ameri-
can poetess, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, writes thus
prettily of cremation “ Snowy clothing enve-
lopes the body. The door swings noiselessly open.
The iron cradle disappears in a glory of crimson
light, as a dove flies into the crimson sunlight and
disappears from you.” After this churchyards
will scarcely retain their popularity.

The English papers are making unkind
remarks about Miss Howick and Mr. Clarke. Mr.
C. is a married man and Miss H. is a blushing
young innocent of 15 summers. Circumstances
threw them together and they loved. Nought
but the inconvenient Mrs. Clarke stood ’twixt
them and bliss unspeakable. In their dilemma
the ingenuous Miss Howick made a suggestion
which we recommend to the careful consideration
of married men. She advised her lover to ad-
minister unto his wife a glass of sherry every
morning on an empty stomach —for a slow poison.
It was so uncommonly slow that the ardent pair
couldn’t wait. They fled. The man is being pro-
secuted for abducting the little innocent, and the
“ poison ” story is common property. The Press,
as aforementioned, is very rough on the giddy
pair, and the London market has been cleared of
sherry. Every married lady has discovered that
her husband wants “ keeping up ” with two
glasses of “ Amontillado” before breakfast. At
latest dates the men were taking their poison
without a murmur, but no deaths were reported.

Murderer Caffrey has some original ideas.
His alleged proposal that as the presence of Grace
Graham on board the cutter Sovereign of the Seas
created dissension between himself and his mate
Penn, the girl should be shot and throw r n over-
board, comes upon one with all the force of a re-
velation. If when, as often happens, jealousy,
Verging almost on murder, arises on board a P.
and O. or Orient liner through the smiles of a
lady-passenger, the fair smiler were calmly de-
spatched and committed to the deep by order of
the captain, a vast amount of trouble would be
saved, but it is to be feared that public opinion
has not yet been educated up to this point. Ac-
cording to the Sydney Globe, by-the-bye, Penn is
a pleasant looking young man; but the Even-
ing News thinks he carries Cain on his
forehead. We pin our faith, however, to
the Globe, for whenever a citizen is run in the
News spots him as a brutal-looking villain whose
face i-j in league against him, and who has murder
branded in every wrinkle of his jaw. This is the
result of being in the dock ; even the News itself
if planted there would probably have a slaughter-
ous, yet imbecile, expression, and would look as if
it should be hanged on suspicion. “ Place the
most honest and pleasing face behind these
spikes,” said Mr. Dailey once in bitter sarcasm,
“ and it at once becomes a face that expresses
every passion.” We don’t mean, of course, to im-
ply that the News has a pleasing face, or an
honest one either —we wouldn’t say such a thing
for the world; but we are prepared to bet it would
be a very suspicious-looking object under the cir-
cumstances Mr. Dailey described.

The Mayor of St. Peter's gave a ball to the aldermen and

Canterbury has a team of good-natured amateur minstrels,

“ Th-a-a-nks 1" is all one often gets for a lot of trouble.

A social was tendered to Alderman Whiting, of Leichhardt,
at the Albert Hall on the sth inst. Dancing commenced
about 9 o'clock and continued till 5 am., and some good
songs were given by way of variety. There was a very large
attendance, and as regards the ladies it is only necessary to
say they were all lovely ; so were their dresses.
We read that “ when the ‘ colonial gang’ visited Liverpool
(Eng.) the N.S.W. clerk of the peace, Mr. A. C. Fraser, was
selected to respond on behalf of the visitors, to the infinite
disgust of Mr. R. B. Smith, M.L.A. The same thing hap-
pened at Chester and at Eaton Hall, where nothing but the
presence of the Duke of Westminster prevented a fracas.
The master plumbers of Sydney feel with us about concerts,
and consequently when they hire the Protestant Hall, they
do not waste any good wind in song until they have laid m a
vocal supply of beef and beer. This they did 9n the 13th

a gold watch and chain. We believe more in plumbing than
before.
In the marriage-agreement between Lord Oastlerosse (late
ADO. to Sir Henry Loch and Miss Baring) it is stipulated
that all children of the marriage shall be brought up Roman
Catholics. The lady is a daughter of a member of the great

The Bathurst Bachelors’ Quadrille Club held their annual
ball and banquet in the local School of Arts on the 6th inst.
The ball consisted chiefly of dancing, and the banquet of
victuals, both of which were very much enjoyed. A number
of the ladies appeared in fancy costume, the Duchess of
Devonshire,” 44 Snow,” and 44 Romp being perhaps the
most admired.
The fancy-dress ball held in the Masonic Hall, West Mait-
land, recently, by the Our Boys’ Social Club, was a colossal
success. The dancers nujnbered upwards of 80, and 200
visitors looked on. Maty of the costumes were really
elegant, among them being courtiers, pirates, kings, queens,
the thread-bare Nancy Lee, a peasant, a policeman, and a
parson. In spite of the two last named, the affair was con
ducted soberly and orderly.
A successful ball was given by Mr. A. P. West to his pupils
on the evening of the 13th inst. The French cotillon was
danced in a most graceful and perfect way ; limelight being
thrown on the scene added very much to the picturesque re-
sult Most of the ladies were in evening dress, the remainder
in fancy costumes. A pretty dress was composed of claret
velvet, with overskirt of pale pink cr6pe. Another was a
lovely shade of mauve with half-a-dozen rows of mauve
velvet round the bottom of the skirt, and a tablier of cream
lace A handsome dress was blood-red satin with rich black
lace trimmings. An elaborate gown was dark green plush
with overskirt and bodice of embossed green silk.
The love of bad music that characterizes the Australian,
and makes the Italian go o le step lower, found an expression
of its sentiments last week in a concert at St. Barnabas
Church. Upwards of 500 lovers of art rolled up, and there
was the usual amount of high-toned agony gone through on
fiddles, pianos, and other instruments that have gone far to
make modern civilization a bad exchange for primitive
savagery. The amateur concert fiend has a fairly strong
grip on this land, and is not likely to die soon. And yet the
cultivated professional concert-singer, can't make salt in
Sydney. By the way, the footballers, the other evening, left
leather-hunting to show an audience at Sydney Protestant
Hall what they could do in the musical line. They didn t
kick a single goal, and had better stick to leather.
There is to bo a barmaid-show in Sydney
towards the end of the month. However, that is
nothing new. To the bald-headed Sydney man
life is nothing but an eternal barmaid-show.
The blue-Tory townspeople of Windsor
have burned a parson in ettigy because he stated
that the place was in an unsanitary condition. The

people so uncommonly nice that they can’t bear
even the mention of a bad smell.
Thanks to the “ Timaru poisoning case,”
N.Z. promises to take a good position this year in
the colonial slaughter competition. The only
weak point in the affair is it is not yet ab-
solutely certain that anybody was killed, but
the prisoner, Hail, seems to be a genius who
is capable of lending an artistic finish even to an
attempted corpse. He is the nephew of a late
Premier who had the ill luck to be made a
K.C.M.G., and this family disgrace demoralised
him. His wife fell ill, and, like a good husband, he
got a lady friend to nurse her and made love him-
self to the nurse when off duty. But as Mrs.
Hall grew worse the doctor became suspicious,
and a search revealed the fact that Hall
was a walking chemist’s shop with antimony
in almost every pocket; that there was the
same poison in the invalid’s food, drink,
medicine, and, in short, in everything where it
could be crowded in ; that the house was
heavily insured and was stored with kerosene and
other combustibles, while the arrangements
pointed to a scheme for burning the place down
with the helpless wife inside ; and, lastly, two
well-thumbed volumes on slaughterous drugs
were found in the prisoner’s bedroom. After his
arrest it was also discovered that Hall was
at the last financial gasp, and 12 forgeries are
already charged against him. Then his father-in-
law’s corpse was exhumed and the stomach
prospected, a suspicion having arisen that he was
also started across the Jordan with a mysterious
pain in his inside, and that his son-in-law had
feloniously filled him up with drugs before he
went; in the result, the old gentleman crushed
18ozs. to the ton in antimony. This discovery
caused a panic, and there now seems a chance of
the whole graveyard being turned outside in in
the search for more victims, for it is remembered
that Hall’s relatives have been a short-lived race
of late years, and some troublesome people are
anxious to discover the reason why.

There is a Scotchman, a squatter on the
Murrumbidgee, one M’Dougal, who will only em-
ploy his countrymen, and will tell you so. One
day he had refused an Englishman a job, and the
latter went on to Narandera and happened to
attend a play on the same evening. The piece

Melbourne man out for a holiday in the
Far West had done a long day's ride, and was
dismounting, tired, dusty, and hungry at a bush
hostelry. Visions of victuals flitted across his
mind, and then through the open window he
heard the silvery voice of the landlady : “ John,
just stick the jam-tin by the fire to draw the ants
out and swish the blow-flies off the meat and give
it a good shake, and we’ll have some supper.”

I Perhaps the N.S.W. public do not know
that if a man is “wanted” and tracked by a
blackfellow and a whitefellow (policemen), on the
return journey at night he has to sleep hobbled to
the nigger. This occurred out West some time
since, and the prisoner was rash enough to try to
escape whilst the “ trap ” was drunk in the bar of
a pub. The darkie, however, was a great bruiser
and gave him an unmerciful “bashing,” which
kept him quiet till Sir Robert had had his morning
brandy and soda. In justice to the tracker it
must be stated that ho reported the whole affair
to the sergeant.
No parson is a humorist— the parson who
isn’t fit to be a parson alone excepted. Here is an ex-
tract from Glad Tidings, a little Sydney Metho-
dist print, run, no doubt, by some dull, badly-paid
well-meaning clergyman:—“ At the same open-air
gathering stood a poor fellow, a victim to the
drink-fiend, who had formerly been a skilled
artizan, and had worked at the ornamental stone-
work on the pillars of our Newington College.
Moved by the addresses of the speakers he was
among the penitents ....
Kre he left, he professed to rest his weary heart on
Christ. Early the next morninp he wan pi Iced vp
a lifeless corpse in the Domain.” The italics are
our contemporary's. Who but a parson could,
under the circumstances, have been guilty of
italicising this sentence ?

body expects a good sazen, they’ve taken a holi-
day, and come along t’ hear th’fun.” “Fun!”
exclaimed the horror-stricken Judge; “do they
call this fun ?” And then he bowed his horse-hair
head, and wept bitterly, like the boy in the play
when the Chinaman kissed his mother.
Hodge was sick and in a state of extreme
debility. “Do you often take a bath ?” asked the
doctor who had been called in. “Bath! Naw
but I heard once upon a toime that my mother
had them sev’ral toimes.”
A queer fact in natural history. Accord-
ing to Seeley’s lately-published book, in some of
the Swedish lakes large birds of prey are in the
habit of swooping down on the pike basking at
the surface of the water. If the pike is more
powerful than the bird, the latter, unable to ex-
tricate his talons, is borne to the bottom and
drowned. The flesh of the pike heals with the
talons of the bird in its back, while the bird be-
comes converted into a skeleton, which is carried
about by the pike. One skeleton, long exhibited
by a pike in Lake Wetter, had acquired a greenish
tinge, and was regarded by the fishermen as a
harbinger of misfortune. Another skeleton, car-
ried by a pike in Lake Fryksdal, was known to
the fishermen for some time as the water sprite,
and they fled from it in fear. It is said to have
appeared like the horns of an elk or reindeer
moving rapidly over the water ; but at last the
pike was shot and the water sprite shown to be
the skeleton of a sea-eagle.

A Good Remedy for a Cold.— On going to bed
take a dose of Freeman’s Chlorodyne, either in
water or camphor mixture. The diaphoretic action
of this excellent remedy speedily produces a
general glow, followed by a free perspiration, dur-
ing which the pulse improves in character from a
feeble to a full, elastic one, a good night’s sleep is
obtained, and on waking in the morning the cold
will be found to have dissapeared. The certainty
of the action of Freeman’s Chlorodyne is very re-
markable in Ague; it frequently prevents an
attack, or, failing this, reduces the violence of the
ague fit to a minimum. In many countries Free-
man’s Chlorodyne has entirely superseded the use
of Quinine, and in the tea gardens of India noth-
ing else is given for Ague and other forms of Fever.
Insist upon having “Freeman’s” only. Trade
mark, an Elephant.—obtainable from all chemists
and storekeepers.

OPPOSITE THE MARKETS,
SYDNEY.
ESTABLISHED 1883.
WE have again much pleasure in addressing
our customers and the public. The rapid
expansion of our business, and the repeated orders
we receive from customers who dealt with us as
far back as 1882, are gratifying proofs that our
Goods and our method of doing business give
satisfaction.
We continue the same system. We buy direct
from the makers in London, Paris, and New York
all such Goods, Watches, See., as are not the pro-
duct of our Company’s own works. We add a
fair and reasonable profit, and SELL FOR CASH,
thus avoiding bad debts, and steering clear of the
evil system of charging rates which compel paying
customers to make good the default of bad marks
HERE IS THE BASIS OF OUR SYSTI M.
The full value must accompany any order, or no attention
will be paid to it. Payment can be made by Postage Sta'Ol'S
of any Australian colony up to £1 worth, by Cheque sr vf
P. O. 0., payable to the Oriental Gold Co.
The Goods ordered will be sent at once. If they a'-e not
approved they may be returned per first post after deliver V
uninjured, and we will, according to th? wish of the ousto u.ef •
either substitute another article to same value, or
WE RETURN THE MONEY IN FULL
deducting merely the trifle of actual postal charges.
Thus: Suppose you want a Brooch—you describe, as nearly
as possible, the sort of pattern you prefer, or you leave the
choice entirely to us, and you remit, say 10s.
We endeavour to match your description, if sent, or n any
case we do our best to please and satisfy you.
On receiving the Brooch, or other article, if you don t entire'*
like the pattern or style, write by first mail explaining in wh; 1 "
respect you would like it to differ—returning the lirooc i m
the same good order as you received it—thereupon we win
try again, and send a second one to same value.
Or, if you don’t like the first Brooch at all, and want yonf
money back, we will send back the full sum, less the postal
outlay incurred.
We make this pledge in all seriousness, although wibj
something ®f a light heart; because, although we have Illy-.®
thousands of orders by post on same terras, durum lne
four years we have been in business at our present address—

MEDICAL EXPERTS.
THEIR TESTIMONY ON A SUBJECT OF
UNIVERSAL AND VITAL IMPORTANCE.
In the average medical man prejudice and pro-
fessional caste is very strong. He is educated in
this atmosphere, and his associations in after years
hut strengthen his early teachings. Yet there
are minds in the profession, active, alert, vigorous,
abreast and ahead of their day and generation,
who refuse to be bound and stand still. If they
cannot cure with their list of preparations they are
willing to try others, albeit they are of another
school, or mayhap no school at all. If a new
theory for the successful combating of disease is
advanced, or a new preparation for the alleviation
of suffering humanity is discovered, they do not
cry it down because it is new, or because it comes
to them out of the beaten track of precedence.
Scores of reputable physicians, becoming dis-
couraged at the results of their prescriptions in
their own cases and in those of their patients, have
put aside prejudice and used Warner’s Safe
Remedies for the diseases for which they are re-
commended with the most gratifying and perma-
nent results. They have freely attested these
facts over their own signatures, and have gladly
given their testimony that for the cure of diseases
of the kidneys, liver, and Urinary organs,
“ Warner’s Safe Cure ” has marked an epoch in
medical jurisprudence. Read the attested facts
from men who have graduated from the best
medical colleges with highest honours and have
made the science of medicine a life-long study.
R. A. GGNN, M.D., Dean of the Uuited States
Medical College, New York.—I had everywhere
heard of Warner’s Safe Cure, but somewhat hesi-
tated to recommend it —but a personal friend,
whose application for insurance on his life was re-
jected on account of Bright’s Disease came to me.
A chemical and microscopical examination of his
urine revealed quantities of albumen and granular
tube casts, confirming the Bright’s Disease. After
trying all the usual remedies in vain, 1 directed
him to uSu Warner’s Safe Cure. Within four
months no tube casts could be found, and only a
ace of albumen ; and, as he expressed it, he felt
perfectly well.” After this demonstration of its
power, I prescribed it in full doses in both acute
nd chronic Bright’s disease, with the most satis-
actory results. I find that in Bright’s Disease it
eems to act as a solvent of albumen ; to soothe
and heal inflamed membranes, and wash out epi-
thelial [debris which blocks up the tubuli uriniferi
—urine-bearing tubes] ; and to prevent the destruc-
tive metamorphosis of tissue
W. M. S. CLINE, M.D., Tom’s Brook, Va.—I
think it is my duty to state what benefit I de-
rived from Warner’s Safe Cure. I had a frequent
desire to urinate night and day as often as ten
times or more an hour. Pain over right kidney
extending down the leg, extreme wakefulness,
failure of strength, dark-coloured urine, and later,
oily and sudsy, with a large per cent, of albumen.
I used various medicines prescribed by eminent
physicians, and experienced no relief. I was loth
to use proprietary medicine, but, having heard
Warner’s Safe Cure so highly recommended, I tried
a few doses. Prom the first the medicine helped
me, and I experienced untold relief. I tested my
urine daily, and in loss than a month all traces of
albumen disappeared. To all who suffer from
kidney or bladder trouble, I can cordially com-
mend Warner’s Safe Cure.
A. J. BENEDICT, M.D., Watertown, N.Y.—1
Used Warner’s Safe Cure and other Safe remedies
daily in my practice with the most gratifying re-
sults. I find them after f years of practical ob-
servation all they are recommended to be. For
diseases of the kidneys, liver, and urinary organs,
they are specifics.
Dr. B. H. MARS, 1640 Carondolet Ave., St.
Louis, Mo. —After using all remedies known to
me as a regular graduate and practising physician
in one or two cases of kidney disease, or Bright s
Disease, I concluded to perscribe Warner’s Safe
Cure, and it woruod like magic with the patient,
entirely restoringhim, which was astonishing to met
Dr. E. MORSE, Ashtabula, O.—I have pre-
scribed Warner’s Safe Cure in several cases of
kidney and bladder,trouble, and always with good
results.
1. B. DOWNING, M.D., Haddock, Va.-I have
advised Warner’s Safe Remedies in several cases
of renal diseases, and in two thby effected radical
cures.
THOMAS EDW. STACK, Smyrna, N.Y.—I
have used Warner’s Safe Cure in the treatment of
both acute and chronic disorders of the liver. I
find it a specific for torpid liver. I take great
pleasure in recommending Warner s Safe Cure to
the public and profession.
Ed
S. W. RAMSAY, M.D., Albia, La.—I hereby
certify that I have been a practising physician for
27 years, and for many chronic cases in my prac-
tice do recommend Warner’s Safe Cure.
AAAtO(/7^t4Al' A
JAMES D. BRAGG, M. D., Bridgeport, CL, I
speak highly of Warner’s Safe Remedies. They
have proved the best medicines for humanity yet
devised.
JX {o.syct'&p 7}\
C ORRYETTE, M. D., Wyandotee, Ks. —With
Warner’s Safe Cure I have cured several cases of
Bright’s disease and other very bad kidney dis-
orders. I believe it far superior to anything
known to the medical profession. It is one of my
daily prescriptions, and of great service in every
instance. a t
A MIS-STEAK.
“The Gaol-Kitchenman who, in contravention of the regulations, acceded to the request made
by murderer Reynolds, just before his execution that he should be supplied with a fried steak,
has been reported to the Comptroller-General of Prisons"-Daily Paper.
GHOST: “I AM TERRIBLY OPPRESSED.”
KITCHENMAN: “YOUR CRIME WAS A TERRIBLE ONE."
GHOST: “IT’S NOT MY CRIME, IT’S THE FRIED STEAK. WHY THE DEUCE DIDN'T
YOU GRILL IT?”
df
“Mr. Jones,” said the Manager, with cold severity to the
Accountant, while all the tellers and ledger-keepers pricked
up their ears at his tone and manner, “ The Inspector ia in
my room and Wishes to have a word with you.” when Jones
entered the manager’s room be was followed by that officer
who carefully closed the door after him, there was a buzz in
the bank. “ What’s Jones being up to?' “ I always said he'd
fiddle with the securities, first chance,” and so forth, was
whispered round.
Jones found the Inspector seated in awful state in the
manager’s chair.
“ Your salary,” Mr. Jones, said the Inspector, referring to
some notes “ is £450 a year.”
“ It is," faltered Jones, who didn’t like the boss’s tone.
“ And you have to maintain a wife and five children, I
think 1
“ Yes, sir."
“ Your eldest daughter ia quite a grown-up young lady
hey?’
“Quite so" stammered Jones, growing red and pale by
turns.
“ I am informed that you have no private source of income
Mr. Jones.
‘ I have not, sir.
“ Then, Mr. Jones, you will not be surprised when I inform
you that representations have been made to the bank, that
your wife and daughter habitually wear jewellery, when in
evening dress, of a class and costliness which is plainly in-
compatible with your means. I should like to know, Mr.
Jones, where you derive the money to purchase these beauti-
ful and expensive articles I hear of. They can’t be family
heirlooms, for I have the best information that the designs
are in the most recent taste.”
Poor Mr. Jones ceased to stroke the bald place on the back
of his head, and his eyes flashing fire, he r etorted warmly
“so you considered me a thief because my wife and my
daughter wear such decorations as help to set off their at-
tractions. Do you think sir that your wife and your daughter
monopolize the right to such embellishments. Sir the
jewellery which sets off the lovliness of my daughter and the
matronly dignity of ray wife, to the point of exciting the
jealous spitefulness of your daughter and wife (for I under-
stand now whence you derive your information) is Oriental
Gold Jewellery. It ia as beautiful as the costliest articles and
yet its trifling cost enables my wife and daughter to appear in
the same society as yours without disadvantage and without
my being gudty of the thefts which you generously suspected
me guilty of. Your questions and your suspicions, your
manner and your attitude are alik*? insulting. I tender you
here my resignation and I have to inform you that my
daughter iv next month to be married to Mr. Woolsworth,
who has also asked me to accept the management of his
financial affairs, at a salary, sir, which your own manager
doer not enjoy 1 I wish you* good morning, sir.”
“Just to think,” grumbled the Inspector’s plain, sour
daughter that evening when her father had told her the event
of the morning and stormed at her and her mother for placing
him in so false a position ; “just to think that it’s all owing
to that Oriental Gold being so lovely and so cheap. To
snatch young Woolworth from under my very nose too."

Dr. BELL’S BITTERS
NEVER KNOWN TO FAIL.
It CUKES where all other MEDICINES FAIL, as it
acts DIRECTLY and AT ONCE on the KIDNEYS,
LIVER, and BOWELS, restoring them to a healthy
action. It is a safe, sure, and speedy cure, and hun-
dreds have been cured by it, when Physicians and
friends had given them up to die.
IT IS BOTH A SAFE CORE AND A SPECIFIC.
It cures all Diseases of the Kidneys, Liver, Bladder,
and Urinary Organs, Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes,
Bright’s Disease, Nervous Diseases, Excesses, Female
Weaknesses, Jaundice, Biliousness, Headache, Sour
Stomach, Dyspepsia, Constipation, Piles, Pains in the
Back, Loins, or Side, Retention or Non-retention of
Urine.
HEED THE WABITING.
By not heeding the warnings of Nature, many persons
are laid up on a bed of sickness and suffering for weeks,
months, or years. There is hardly a disease that
attacks the system which is not preceded by symptoms.
Let these symptoms be attended to and the disease
will be nipped in the bud. Note the following .
KIDNEY
disease'
I
Pain in Small of Back, Pain in
Loins, Flushes of Heat and Chills,
with Disordered Stomach, Bowels,
Headache, Weakness, &c. In fact,
Kidney Complaint appears in so
many different ways, it is im-
possible to name them all.
Dr. Bell’s Bitters has cured some
of the most stubborn forms of
Kidney Disease ; in fact, has never
been used without good effect.
DYSPEPSIA
{Variable Appetite, Faint Gnawing
Feeling at Pit of Stomach,Bad Taste
in the Mouth, Feeling of Weight and
Wind in the Stomach, Bad Breath,
Headache, and Constipation. Dr.
Bell’s Bitters will positively relieve
any of above symptoms, and cure
Dyspepsia.
Any one of the above symptoms is not sufficient to
cause any alarm, and many persons do not pay any
attention to it until the symptoms multiply, and they
discover disease has made great inroads, and possibly
firmly established itself in the system.
Note. —Any poor Person, or the manager of any
Hospital, Asylum, or Old People’s Home, may obtain
the Bitters gratuitously, upon written application to
the Agents, accompanied by a certificate of a Minister
of the Gospel, certifying that they are unable to pay
for medicine.

ROWLANDS’ ODONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
ROWLANDS’ EUKONIA is a beautifully pure,
delicate, and fragrant toilet powder, and has
lately been much improved. Each box has inside
the lid a certificate of purity from Dr. Redwood
Ph D., F.C.S., &c. Sold in three tints; white,
rose, and cream.
RGWDANDS’ MACASSAR OIL can now be also
had in a golden colour, which is especially suited
for fair or golden-haired children and persons.
Four sizes.
Ask any dealer in perfumery for Rowlands
articles, of 20 Hatton Garden, London, and avoid
spurious worthless imitations.

undecided where to go to
obtain an artistic and withal

accept what is but well-meant
counsel, and at once pay a visit
to the vestibule leading to Gal-
leries in Sydney Arcade. There
you can inspect a choice collec-
tion of portraiture (the every-day
work of Creelman and Co.) the
excellence of which, we venture
to say, ought at once to determine
your choice in their favour, and
take away all doubt as to the

The Poetry and Prose of the Recent Rain.
The country needs rain is the thought that sustains our artist as
he lies in bed pending the drying of his things, ‘
This ia the Mayor’s Jubilee party out fora picnic round the harbor.
How sweet to press the pillow
Of a cottage chamber bed,
And listen to the patter
Of the raindrops overhead.’ 1
Which is pretty and poetic
If the house is water-proof,
But suppose you had a landlord
Who declined to mend the roof.
Two souls with but a single mackintosh.
Selector Jones : “I tell you what, Smith, this
rain will be the savin’ of my pumpkins. It’s just what
Ive been prayin’ for. There’s nothing like faith.”
Selector Smith ; “ Confound your pumpkins. You
might have kept your faith bottled Up till I got ray
scrub burned off, It’s unueighbourly of you, Jones.”
d
Mr. Daddleskip “ This rain will do a lot of good,
Miss Blinkinsulcker,"
Mrss B. : “ Yes, it will furnish dull people with
material for conversation, if nothing else.”
