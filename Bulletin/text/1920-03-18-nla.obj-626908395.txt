A SONNET SEQUENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
Young children’s laughter and the scent of
fire—
Sweet fire of leaves and myrrh of toasting
sap—•
Small winds trip dancing in and seem to tire
After three jangles of old Folly’s cap.
The grave, rich pages frown upon a day
Too ankie-slijn for the strong march of
thought. •
Shut out, shut out the heresy of play!
Back to the Porch where the firm word is
taught!
But slanting sunshine darts between the
leaves—
For this a thousand planets died in dust.
Man’s dust of ages from the low ground
grieves :
“We died for truth; in truth is all our
trust.”
Truth —words, ink, knowledge! Truth’s a
butterfly—
Gay-laughter is the thing that cannot lie.
11.
I made strange reading on a grey-green day
When sun and soil had sealed a drooping
truce
Of dry and fluttered leaves, and all the way
Under tall trees was hot • and crackling
loose
With fallen twigs and little flakes of bark
Crisped by the parching airs. And there
I went,
A hundred pages deep through the wet dark
And heard the dripping on a leathern tent.
What sword is this that fits my grasping
hand.
What padded helm that presses on my hair,
What world gone wrong—gone right—what
mossy land
Sighs weeping through a great forgotten
care ?
I had forgotten. .. .1 shall soon forget... .
Dear God, the red weed dripping, dripping
yet!
111.
Standish O’Grady in a “Bog of Stars,”
Yeats planting butter-beans in Innisfree.
Without, the shocking thunder reels and jars
And strange electric discords thrill in me, t
While, river-wide, the leaping lightning flares
And the rain lashes on the iron roof.
I shall meet pleasant angels unawares,
Angels without reproach, without reproof,
Walking with Steven, Patsy and the ass. . ..
- God, what a flash - ! The air is choking hot.
Angels in motley—donkeys on the grass—
The world is glad because the world is not.
The thunder growls afar and still I sit
While Heaven quakes to find a threep’ny bit.
IV.
No poet sings all day to every mood,
But now the rain has sweetened leaf and
land,-
Poor is the change of rhyme that seems
not good
To growing hearts that swell and under-
stand.
Old pipes, old strings, old ecstasies of sound
How do you crowd into the words men
made ?
Each syllable some happy singer found
In the green season of the leaf and blade.
Each word was as a melody complete,
• A scented flame of thought to hold and
prize;
A hundred dreams of life were in each beat
Of the swift phrase that made a people
wise.
Book friends, be glad. You have - no faults
at all
While that green creeper rhymes against the
wall.

V.
These had gone out into the wilderness
And I had read with them from fear to
fear,
Felt the long trail over the mountains press
Till continents were singing in my ear.
There is a track between two gum-trees
high,
A leafy path that cleaves a rocky wall,
Wattle and Christmas bush and ferns that
sigh
When the breeze whistles and the bush-
birds call. .
Standing a-tiptoe just above my book
I see a world of green adventure spread
Up to a grey, mysterious rocky nook
Where, brave at dusk, this evening I might
tread.
Vast is the journeyed earth on maps
unfurled—
Nay, five green acres overlap the world!
VI.
God thought the west between a dream .of
doom
And golden pastures cooled with His
sweet breath *
Wherein great rubies, starred and petalled,
bloom.
Shouting in fire His challenge to black
death.
Blood? Not the bleeding from cold swords
that slay,
But livinsr blood of all the ages’ heart;
With this,He painted the wide end of day,
Drawing the curtains of the skies apart
Behind the tall, thin stems Softly I read
Of young love piping down the morning
air....
Young love—young blood! Oh, happy day
not dead !
Too red with joy of life and life to spare.
As God the day’s sleep-crimson lightly flung
I knew that truth, the years and love were
young.

DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
The Talent of Compton Mackenzie
“Compton’s Comedy Company” toured the
provinces and London suburbs with old
favorites—“ She Stoops to Conquer,” “The
School for Scandal,” “London Assurance”
and plays of that type and period. The ren-
derings were always workmanlike, without
too much embarrassing finesse or skill, 'and
the show was always popular—so many
neopip have not seen “The School for
Scandal” or would like to remind themselves
of their visit to it in 1840, when Aunt Sarah
was with them.
Compton Mackenzie, the son of that
Edward Compton, is barely 37. “The Pas-
sionate Elopement” was published when the
author was 28, and “Carnival” about the
same time. These are very skilful stories;
the sustained charm of the artificial ■'Car-
nival” is fascinating. Both are tours de
force of the highest merit; if there were no
other Compton Mackenzie books, they are
enough to make the London reputation qf
their author for some years.
In 1913 “Sinister Street” was published, a
drastic departure from the engaging frivoli-
ties of those other two books. It has all
the qualities of a great novel, except the
humility and simplicity necessary for that
achievement. The long, unconventional
chain of incidents works serenely and inevit-
ably to its climax. The characterisation
throughout is deft and often illuminating.
The style is correct and smooth; not free
from slight affectations, it is true, but they
are not irritating affectations. The matter
is rich and full. All the types portrayed
are interesting, exceptional personalities. The
book reads as if it were written at a sit-
ting, a strong, nervous effort of imagination
that had carried the author away as surely
as inspiration would have carried him away.
Each character, from the lead to the most
forlorn super, is etched in with a sharp
certainty of touch that Arnold Bennett him-
self must surely fiud admirable. The gradual,
consistent unfolding of the tale is absorb-
ingly interesting. There is one technical
fault: the lead’s speeches in duologue and
conversation are too long; no man evrv
spoke his thoughts’ in that rococo, sparkling
prose. The older method of the occasional
third-person paragraph is truer and, by its
reserve, more dramatic. That, I think, is
all that can be said adversely of the book
artistically; otherwise the work seems to
be technically beyond praise.
But at the end of it you close it and look
again at the title : “Sinister Street.” The devil-
ish cunning of the stage management of the
kcenes comes back to you ; the impression of
ripe, embittered experience; the studious
avoidance of “fine writing”; the self-con-
scious, revealing reserve of this sinister'
street. Not one of the people who pass
up and down is not clever —each one is
unusual, in his way. If a woman glances
ever so slightly at a man, a sensual signi-
ficance is given to the glance by atmosphere,
if not by direct implication in the text. The
sinister weighs heavily on the book. The
sins of early adolescence are given a vast
importance of which they are entirely un-
worthy. The little mistakes in conduct
lead in the end to bitter tragedy
—the little mistakes that you and I make
often, and which lead logically to nothing
but a passing consciousness of error. Over
the pungent richness of the color and the
real beauty of the style, a dark foreboding
hangs; each passing act and word is preg-
nant with a significance which no passing
thing in life possesses. The strained and
close-knit nervous argument forces these
details into a consistent place in the climax,
but that is done by the power of words, not
by logic. The author’s focus seems to be
that of the Devil’s Advocate of the Canon-
isation Court. And of his skill, his aston-
ishing technique 'he appears to be quite con-
scious. He has called his book “Sinister
Street,” as if he meant its name to weigh
heavily on its spirit.
“Sinister Street II.” followed I;, and “Guy
and Pauline,” which in effect is Sinister
Street 111. The war came; in 1915 Mac-
kenzie was a war correspondent, 4 and crea-
tive work was suspended. Last year “Sylvia
Scarlett” came out, and this year “Sylvia
and Michael” is.to hand. The flair is toned
down a little ; and in technique there is
riper and surer knowledge of values —there
are not so many emotional dramatic scenes.
But there is no change in the focus. A group
of mentally-distinguished, people is created,
and an unusual atmosphere of mental adven-
ture —both presented with a certainty, a
sure skill as entirely admirable as it is hard
to find in modern fiction. But the speeches
are ..longer; the first-person thoughts come
oftener in the pages, and the characters are
more interesting and unusual than ever. Life
and the haphazard passers-by in the streets
that are not sinister are farther away than
ever.
It is not easy to skip passages or pages
of an interesting book. In reading Mac-
kenzie’s most interesting books, it is diffi-
cult not to skip, in sheer fatigue of the ner-
vous, artificial matter. One lives through so
much of biting cleverness, so much of tra-
gedy and despair, all so dramatically and
excellently presented, that * the brain can
take in no more. “Can this young surgeon
find no healthy, average man or woman?”
the tired mind asks. “No ordinary, kindly
being, without kink, or brilliance, or this
dire absorption in self? Is there no one in
his world not cursed with distinction?”
It is more than a thousand pities that
there is nothing ordinary, like humility or
sincerity of heart, in the books. If a man
can create false groups of personalities like
this and by supreme artistic power drive
them and their peculiarities into the ears
of a large and logical public, what could he
not do with the men .and women in our street?
Sylvia Scarlett is a consistent body, whole-
some and fresh in mind, untouched physically
or mentally by her enforced three months of
prostitution, broad-minded, brave and most
attractive. But she thinks too much of
herself, in the meaning of the phrase and
of the words. Her confession to the priest
is excellent work ; no more searching analysis
of frustrate motives, of the weary groping
for an anchor of a submerged spirit, has been
written in English this *eentury. But no
woman who was ever anchorless could phrase
and group that trenchant, significant prose.
She would have no need of a priest, or of
anything more than 24 hours a day to make
her own destiny.
A sense of humor would not come amiss
to Sylvia and her serious companions. That
would lift the load of hysteria from the
fine books, and blow the nerves out (the
nerves that make the healthy i*eader skip),
and calm the rush of the highly : strung
spirits. Perhaps at the skirts of Humor
her accustomed company of Simplicity and
Humility would come to help the man in
the ordinary street to find his own thoughts
and ideals, his own laughter and tears, in
his current literature. Then for Compton
Mackenzie an already magnificent equipment
would be quite complete.

This Week’s Toilet Hints
INTERESTING SELECTIONS FROM THE WORLD'S SMARTEST BEAUTY
ARTICLES—SIMPLE RECIPES MOST EFFECTIVE.
HOW TO DISCARD AN UNSIGHTLY
COMPLEXON.
“Toilet Club Notes.”
How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexion in the mirror, “If I
could only tear off this old skin !” And, do
you know, it is now possible to do that very
thing? Not to actually remove the entire
skin all of a sudden; that would be too
heroic a method and painful, too, I imagine.
The worn-out cuticle comes off in such tiny
particles, and so gradually—requiring about
ten days to complete the transformation—it
doesn’t hurt a bit. Day by day the beautiful
complexion underneath comes forth. Mar-
vellous ! No matter how muddy, rough,
blotchy or aged your complexion, you can
surely discard it by this simple process.
Just get some ordinary mercolised wax at
your chemist’s, apply nightly like cold cream,
washing it off in the mornings.
WHY HA\E GREY HAIR
When a simple, old-fashioned and harmless recipe
will correct it?
Pew people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—-that if can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate of tammalite and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few nights
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy, and has given perfect
satisfaction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
A STRANGE SHAMPOO.
“Cosy Corner Chats.”
* * * I was much interested to learn
from this young wotuan with the beautiful
glossy hair that she never washes it with
soap or artificial shampoo powders. Instead
she makes her own shampoo by dissolving a
teaspoonful of stallax granules in a cup of
hot water. “I make my chemist get the
stallax for me,” said she. “It comes only
in sealed packages, enough to make up
twenty-five or thirty individual shampoos,
and it smells so good I could almost eat it."
Certainly this little lady’s hair did look
wonderful even if she has strange ideas of a
shampoo. I am tempted to try the plan
myself.
BLACKHEADS INSTANTLY GO.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment gives
instant relief.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is.now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to obtain some tablets
of stymol from the chemist, drop one into
a glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores im-
mediately contract to normal and the greasi-
ness disappears, leaving the skin smooth,
soft and cool and' free from blemish. But
to make sure that this desirable result is
permanent, it is advisable to repeat the
treatment several times at intervals of say
about four or five days.
IS POWDER NECESSARY?
“Practical Suggestions.”
I say emphatically, No! There is a simple
lotion which can be easily and cheaply made
at home, and it is at. the same time both
effective and beneficial to the complexion.
Cleminite is a splendid substitute for face
powder, which is at the bottom of many
complexion troubles. Get about an ounce
from the chemist,- and dissolve Tn four table-
spoonfuls of water. The result is a fine
clear liquid, which instantly gives the face,
neck or arms that peach-like bloom of
perfect health. There is nothing to equal
it for greasy skins, and the result lasts all
day long under the most trying conditions. [2

and your breath is bad, u you have
constipation and headaches, the
chances are you are bilious. Your
liver needs attention.
Strong purgatives which pro-
duce a re-action only aggravate the
trouble. Gentle assistance is what

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Quest.
The voung moon like a sickle reaped
A field of stars and slept, night-steeped.
"I must be roving," said the boy,
And tightened up his swag of joy.
“My heart cries, ‘Follow, hollow on.
And, mother mine, I would be gone.’
The woman at the hearth-stone wept.
The old man in the corner slept.
Oh, north and south and east and west
They travel old Fortune’s road.
But never yet has a man found rest
Who carried the dreamer’s load.
With whistling lips, by bend and creek,
He journeyed week by yellow week.
The wide busli-world of leaf and flower
He scorned in that adventurous hour,
Went singing, singing after him
Unto the blue horizon’s rim.
“He’ll come no more,” the woman said.
The old man shuffled off to bed.
Oh, all the world is a man’s to roam
On the land and the sea’s green track ;
But many a road that heads from home
Is the road he never comes back.
The old man’s grave is green with grass.
He hears no more the blithe spring pass.
The house is cpiiet. Cold and shrill
The wind comes whistling up the hill.
And daily, when her toil is done,
And westward slopes the lonely sun,
The woman sets a meal for two,
And waits, «and hopes the slow year through.
But north and south and east and west
He seeks, who never shall find
On the dreamer’s road that knows no rest,
The good that he left behind.

ZORA CROSS.
The Ghost Bereft.
The poor ghost came through the wind and
rain,
And passed down the old, dear road again ;
Thin cowered the hedges, the tall trees
swayed
Like little children that shrink afraid.
The wind was wild and the night was late
When the poor ghost came to the garden
gate.
Dank were the flower-beds, heavy and wet;
The weeds stood up where the rose was set.
The wind was angry, the rain beat sore,
When the poor ghost came to its own house-
door :
“And shall I find her a-weeping still
To think how alone I lie, and chill V
“Or shall I find! her happy and warm,
With her dear head laid on a new love’s
arm ?
“Or shall I find she has learned to pine
For another’s love, and not for mine?
“Whatever chance, I have this to my store:
She is mine—my own for evermore.”
So the poor ghost came through the wind
and rain
Till it reached the square bright window-
pane.
“Oh ! what is here in the room so bright—
Hoses and love and a hid delight?
“What lurks in the silence that fills the
room ?
A cypress wreath from a dead man’s tomb?
“What wakes, what sleeps? Ah, can it be
Her heart that is breaking and not for me?”
Then the poor ghost looked through the win-
dow-pane,
Though all the glass was wrinkled with rain.
“Oh. there is light—at the feet and head,
Twelve tall tapers about the bed.
“Oh. there are flowers, white flowers and
rare.
But not the garland a bride may wear.
“Jasmine white, and a white, white rose —
But its scent is gone where the lost dream
goes.
“Lilies laid on the straight white bier:
But the room is empty, she is not here.
“Her body lies here deserted, cold ;
And the body that loved it creeps in the
mould.
“Was there ever an hour when my love, sei
free.
Would not have hastened and come to me?
“Can the soul that loved mine long ago
Be hence and away and I not know?
“Oh. then, God’s judgment is on me sore,
For I have lost her for evermore!”
And the poor ghost fared through the wind
and rain
To its own appointed place again.
But un in Heaven, where memories cease
Because the blessed have won to peace,
One pale saint shivered, and closer wound
The shining raiment that wrapped her
round:
“Oh. glad is Heaven, and glad am I.
Yet I fain would remember the days gone by.
“The past is hid and I may not know —
But I think there was sorrow long ago.
“The sun of Heaven is warm and bright.
But I think there is rain on the earth to-
night.
/
“O Christ, because of Thine own sore pain.
Help all poor souls in the wind and rain!”

MANUFACTORIES AND WORKS.
‘Manufactories and Works”, is the rather
quaint name that the N. S. Wales Statis-
tician gives to his annual volume. It is
complete up to 1918, and as an essay on
the dry rot of the Ma State it is a book
of eloquence and enlightenment. In the
beginning there are some cheerful features.
In 1918 N. S. Wales possessed 5414 fac-
tories with 120,554 employees, and both
are slightly on the increase once more. The
wages paid are bigger than ever before; so
are the values of lands, buildings, plant,
machinery and tools; so is the value of the
raw materials used; likewise the value of
the goods turned out. In fact, everything
that can be measured by the nominal value
of depreciated paper-money looks better,
and if the paper £l-note, which is now worth
about 13s. 4d. outside Australia, went down
till it was worth only 6s. Bd. the improve-
ment on paper would be greater still. As
regards concrete matters, the usual results
appear—that production in a multitude of
lines is growing - less; that, despite much
more machinery and much better machinery
to help them, more people make fewer goods;
and that the premeditated wickedness of kill-
ing off country industries and wiping out coun-
try population and destroying country towns
and dragging everything to the One Big
City is still in full blast.
The Statistician divides N. S. Wales
manufactures under 82 headings. There are
31 categoi-ies under which the output of
1917 was less than that of 1916. Thei-e are
30 in which the output of 1918 was less than
that of 1917. The diminishing industries
include such simple essentials as boots and
shoes, boot uppers, bricks, pickles, sauces,
hats and caps, jam, dried fruits, soft soap,
tiveed and cloth —all things in increasing
demand with the increase of population, and
all with raw material handy. Employees
are more numerous, but the results are
worse. The boot and shoe business i-eached
its poor humble best in 1910. Though there
are more feet in the community and rather
more workers employed, the output has
diminished by nearly 77,000 pairs. Woollen
and tweed was at its top in 1916 with an
output of 2,447.910 yards, and has gone
down to 2.044,745 yards. There wei-e
389,435,000 bricks made in 1913, but the
output has fallen to 218,005,000. This,
combined with the very extensive work-
stoppage by the bricklayers, makes house
famine, and house famine makes high rents,
and high rents make silly politicians who
clamor for Direct Action. The announce-
ment that a certain class of imported boot
now selling at 525. (it was once about
255.) will probably cost 80s. before the
end of 1920 is quite logical in the circum-
stances. A community which wants more
boots and makes less, and never made nearly
enough, must pay what is asked or go bare-
footed. Also, with more people to wear suits,
and the miserably inadequate supply of local
suits growing ever smaller, it needn’t
wonder that the foreign profiteer now asks
£l5 15s. for a covering for Australian
nakedness. These are the things that happen
when the local supply is mei-ely insufficient.
As regards the many lines in which there
is no local supply at all and has never been
any, the things that are liable to happen,
now the the foreign profiteer is organised
as he never was before, are such that words
fail to express the possibilities.
* * * *
The other outstanding feature, as already
mentioned, is the wicked, purposeful de-
struction of country industries for the
imagined benefit of the bloated metropolis.
Some of the evidences are as follows: —
Factories in Factories in
Metropolitan District Rest of State
(say 185 sq. miles), (say 309,000 sq. miles).
1893.. .. 778 1315
1901.. .. 1415 1952
1906.. .. 1771 2090

1916.. .. 2815 2395
1917.. .. 3005 2351
1918.. .. 3085 2329
And the so-called country “factories”
described in the return for 1918 were
pathetic affairs. No less than 599 of them
employed an average of 2} hands, including
the pi-oprietor—that is to say, in many cases
it was the boss and his son working under
a bark roof. Another 283 averaged less
than four persons, including the boss ox-
capitalist. Nearly one-third of them didn’t
employ machinery of any sort. It is a jest
to call such places factories. Yet Sydney
has no natural advantages to put it so far
ahead. Though it was the first settlement,
and for a long time the only settlement,
the country—a very much smaller country
than it is now, so far as access by road and
rail was concerned—made nearly twice as
good a showing as the Big City even 27
years ago. Many country towns have moi-e
accessible coal than Sydney, for though
Sydney is built over coal the depth of the
deposits has hitherto prevented its profit-
able use. Many country towns are closer
to known iron deposits, and are better sup-
plied with water power and with drinking-
water (Sydney has to rake pretty far afield
for its supplies), and are handy to harbors
which may be less picturesque than Port
Jackson but would serve equally well. They
have been blighted by many things, but
very largely by the extension of railways on
which the charges were faked by the Sydney
bureaucracy so as to take away the indus-
tries, the population and the hopes of every
place that wasn’t Sydney. The general
policy is that raw materials moving towards
Sydney travel cheaply, while those going any
other way travel expensively. So. unless
the brewer or miller in the North or West
or South can get his materials from furthei*
north or west or south—can intercept them,
so to speak, on their way to the octopus,
which is not always possible—he may as
well give up. There are many varieties of
fake practised with the public’s railways*
but they all tend the same way. And their
success has been quite remarkable. It was
no small achievement to be able to repot’t.
as the State Statistician did in 1918, that
A T . S. AYales contained 55 perishing coun-
try municipalities, including places like
Bathurst, Bla.vney, Oarcoar, Goulburu. Gun-
dagai, Hay, Morpeth, Narrabri. Raymond
Terrace, Singleton, Turnut and Yass; also a
number that weren’t dying but dead. Then
the railways lost money for want of country
industries to keep them busy, and agricul-
ture decayed for lack of customers in the
small country towns.
* * # *
The scenery of the old-style country town
nowadays has for its principal features the
abandoned brewery, the sliut-up flour mill,
the deceased tannery or fellmongery, the
oldest inhabitant who remembers when the
place was alive and the raucous politician
from Sydney come up to clatter on decen-
tralisation. Not one impostor among the
city decentralisers ever hints at the fact that
one great essential is not only a new schedule
of railway charges which will destroy every
semblance of ni-eference to the One Big-
City, but one which will give the country
towns a big preference because they have
so many losses to repair and so much lee-
way to make up. In fact, it was only the
other day that a new schedule of rates was
issued which would have driven the Lithgow
ironworks either to close their doors or to
shift to the coast, and only the strenuous
advertisement that the management gave to
the sinful proceeding by shutting up on the
instant made the Railway Department do
a hasty reconsideration. It was an acci-
dent. no doubt, but the accidents shouldn’t
all happen one way. The suppression of
country industries, of course, suits the im-
porters. It is pleasing enough to the city
land-jobbers. It is eminently agreeable to the
Labor bosses and strike-mongers of Sydney
who find their sheep more manageable in
a flock. But it makes very poor show-ing in
"Manufactories and Works” and similar
publications. A lesson to be drawn from
that volume is that this is a good time to
cut down employment in loan works to a
minimum, or rather to cut it out altogether-.
The Ma State requires labor to run a
multitude of new industries, for the way
the foreigner and the importer are taking-
advantage of the fact that we don’t pro-
duce our own cottons and linens and silks is
sufficient to make angels howl. It requires
labor to enlarge the old industries, for when
we only make half our own boots and the
importer threatens to charge 80s. a pair for
the other half, it is calculated to make many
things howl besides angels. And it requires
more labor even to keep the old industries
from becoming worse. When it takes four
men to do the plain, ordinary work formerly
done by three, there is no muscle to spare
for fancy loan works or frilled loan swindles.
BRIGHT SPOTS IN COMMONWEALTH
FINANCE.
The demoralisation of easy loans is still
upon the Hughes Ministry, and it proposes
to get through £53,794,800 this year ending
June 30 as compared with £66,675,767 last
year. So it appears that peace is almost as
costly as war. Of the appalling total
£52,334,579 is disguised as w T ar loans, and
all sorts of things are camouflaged under
this heading, even “Portion of freight and
loading charges on wheat imported into
Tasmania from the mainland, £2000”;
and “Administration of War Precautions
(Prices) Regulations, 1916, £350”; and
“Expenses of Proceedings in Prize
Courts, £500”; and “Administration of
War Legislation, £2000,” and dozens
more like them. Pearce’s useless visit to
London, so that he might look on at the
work Monasii was doing, is made a lien on
posterity; so is the exhibition of Australian
war artists’ pictures in London, and short-
ages in the petty cash. As for the peace-
loan expenditure, there is hardly an item in
it that looks reproductive or that has any
right to be in a loan fund, and such matters
as “upkeep of vessels” for lighthouse busi-
ness doesn’t even pfetend to be “works,” let
alone reproductive works. In fact, a great
part of the loan scheme is a shame and an
infamy. It is allegedly a redeeming feature
that there is a shadow of a sinking fund;
but it is a case of a ha'penny pursuing a
pound, with fifty million new pounds enter-
ing the race each year and fifty million new
ha’pence starting in pursuit.
Still there are bright spots in Federal
finance. One of them is that notable Federal
asset, the Northern Territory. It is cus-
tomary to call this vast property a white
elephant, and every petty Treasurer grudges
his State’s microscopic indirect contribution
to the development of the big property; but
it is quite a respectable elephant. Its total
debt, including the cost of 200 miles of rail-
way, is £3,476,461. Tasmania, with less
than three times as much railway, owes more
than four times as much ; yet Tasmania is
considered quite solvent and not at all ele-
phantine. Last year the N.T. deficit, in-
cluding the loss on the railway, was
£357,760, as compared with £389,339 the
year before, but it wouldn’t have looked so
big if it hadn’t been for payments in reduc-
tion of the debt. The deficit was only a
little more than half the chronic shortage
of Westralia. It was a smaller charge on
the Commonwealth than the amount (about
£435,000) which the other States paid last
year to make up the loss on Westralia’s
transcontinental line and provide a special
subsidy to the Gold State. The Federal
capital at Dryberra covers only 912 square
miles, as compared with the Territory’s
523,620, and the place is in its infancy and
has only begun to spend money, and has only
live miles of railway to show for its money ; yet
it has already cost about one-third as much as
the whole Territory debt. Moreover, the recent
extension of the Territory’s lone and scrappy
railway has slightly improved the situa-
tion, and that is a rare feature among rail-
way extensions. Still, only £3OOO of loan
money is allotted to help complete this great
Federal work, while the Western transconti-
nental receives another £137,000. Many
people had an idea that the Western trans-
continental was paid for, but apparently it
isn’t.

The Commonwealth runs six little fac-
tories, which, added up, show a profit, a
habit that isn’t universal among State fac-
tories. The Commonwealth Bank has in
five years accumulated a reserve fund of
£1,922,970, and last year the profits were
twice as large as those of the biggest (which
is also about the oldest) joint-stock bank in
the Commonwealth. Further, the Common-
wealth’s obscure and inefficient and anti-
quated line of steamers stands for £1,627,317
and the profits for 1917-18 were £576,164, or
about 33 per cent. —this despite that the
charges were moderate compared with those
of Private Enterprise. This is some faint
indication of the amount which has been
lost and is being lost directly by making the
Commonwealth mercantile fleet a mere side-
show. What the indirect loss to Australia
has been through the stoppage of trade, the
missing of war markets, and the sale of
produce for an old song because the country
couldn’t guarantee delivery for lack of its
own ships no one will ever know. It may
be also that Australia is still being looted
annually of 20 times the £576,164 above
mentioned, for there are outside concerns,
brown and white, carrying for us which
make a lot more than 33 per cent.
* * * *
Australia’s railways are, in the gross, fax-
ahead of the needs or the supporting capacity
of the population if judged by the patheti-
cally small returns. Its overseas mercantile
fleet is only equal to about a tithe of its
necessities. The country isn’t reduced to
paying huge tribute to profiteering foreign
brown and w-hite land-carriers, and wouldn’t
be if it suspended nine-tenths of its loan
i-ailway projects, while it is a slave to sea-
carriers of all brands and colors and
religions. There are only three countries of
real importance—Britain, Japan and Aus-
tralia —to which the possession of much
shipping is the essence of existence. They
are the three which might be expected out of
the abundance of their experience to divide
the sea-porterage work of States like Fi-ance
and Italy and Germany and Canada, which
have land frontiers and don’t require to be
maritime. But somehow Australia is out
of the picture. The money invested in the
fleet of All-Australia up to 1918 was only
about twice as much as X. S. Wales invested
in the one line from Nyngan to Bourke,
which loses £23,000 a year and has been
doing that sort of thing for 35 years, and it
is just about as much as the same State
buried in the line from Joppa to Ximmitabel,
which loses £70.000 a year and makes a
habit of it. Yet instead of ships being built
at every port the business lags along at a
pace which does little more than make good
depreciation of the existing squadron.
Canada, which has 3000 miles of land fron-
tier to trade by and hardly requires a mer-
cantile marine, has visions of haying 50
Government vessels, all built in its own
dockyards, at sea in another year, and the
advance guard of its armada is already run-
ning to Australian ports. Australia doesn't
even pretend to keep up with this sort of
effort.
A DIGGER IN BERLIN.
[The following' is written by Major Retchford,
formerly of the sth Division A.I.F. Artillery. Shortly
after the Armistice was signed he and another Aus-
tralian officer visited numerous German towns on
the Rhine. Subsequentlv, while on non-military ser-
vice, he visited Berlin, among other German cities,
and is probably the only Digger officer who has had
the opportunity to become well acquainted With
Fritz at home after his defeat.]
My trip to Berlin was begun in July; I
set out immediately upon the ratification of
peace. The people treated me with great
courtesy; indeed, it seemed to me rathel
overdone. There was only one “incident,”
and that was when the other occupants of
a railway carriage asked a conductor to find
me another seat because they preferred to
be without my company. The discussion
was carried on with great difficulty through
an interpreter with very limited English, and
ended in my being declared more socially
impossible” than ever when I refused to
move. ,
The reception-clerk at the hotel I went to
took a second look at me and then addressed
me in English, lie said he knew from my
appearance that I was “English, although
I was the first enemy civilian he had seen
since the war. At lunch next day a stiangei
asked to be allowed to sit with me at table.
In answer to my question why he spoke to
me in English he said that everyone in the
hotel was aware of my nationality, not be-
cause of my appearance, but because I had
produced a well-filled tobacco pouch in the
lounge. Pipe tobacco was then unknown in
Berlin, although bad cigars and worse cigar-
ettes were obtainable. This man became
very interested when he found that I was
Australian, lie had lived for seven years in
Sydney, had married a Sydney girl, and
his children were living in England. Through
him I met a number of other enemy
“friends,” amongst them several German
officers. With these I had many and long
discussions, and found quite a lot of sub-
jects to disagree upon. Their assertion that
to run steam rollers (our tanks) over flesh
and blood was barbarous and unfair gave
me a chance to make a delicate reference to
poison gas and the Lusitania.
Their argument was that they ln.d stolen
a march on the English in the matter of
gas—merely got in ahead of us, knowing of
our intention to use it on them. The
responsibility for the Lusitania episode they
claimed to have been entirely removed from
their nation when the public was warned
not to travel by her. They propounded the
well-known argument about the submarine
warfare being a legitimate and necessary
response to Britain’s attempt to starve their
population by means of the blockade.
Different individuals placed the origin of
the war upon different shoulders. Some said
the French started it, others that inter-
national Jews were responsible, others that
Russia was to blame; they were, of course,
unanimous in denying the guilt of the Ger-
man people. My own knowledge of German
is limited, so I engaged as interpreter a
hotel clerk who had been employed at the
Savoy in London. This man and others
not of the officer class were aware that the
German Government could at least have pre-
vented the war, but said that it was only
during its later stages and after the Armistice
that the people had found out how they
had been misled. They appeared to believe
—I am satisfied most of them do believe—
that the Kaiser had been fooled by his
advisers. Everyone I spoke to upon the
subject was sure that the Kaiser was sinned
against, but not a sinner. They admitted
that his mental state is not normal, but
claimed that he is a benevolent, kind and
Christian lunatic. Little Willie’s reputa-
tion is quite unlike Cjesar’s wife’s, and
that was given to me by several as a reason
why Germany would never restore its
monarchy.
My interpreter ‘ showed me a barrack-
square large enough for a battalion parade.
In 1915, during the training of soldiers for
the Prussian Guards, a piece of paper was
left on the ground. The punishment was
that the soldiers had to scrub every inch of
that square with tooth brushes. This man
■was one of the victims, and spoke very
bitterly about Prussian military discipline.
The men who were subjected to this treat-
ment were, many of them, Berlin business
men 35 years of age and thereabouts.
Every new acquaintance I made asked
me why Australia entered the war. It was
usually the first question, and my reply was
always listened to with great interest. I
should say that with Australia they included
all the "overseas dominions, incorporating
India. The extraordinary but universal belief
was that as soon as England was involved in
war all the dominions would join with Ire-
land and become, if not actually hostile to
England, at least neutral. When I explained
that Australia had nothing to gain but
much to lose by separate nationality, they
were not easily convinced. One Prussian
Guards officer told me that we had "no
right to push our fingers into other people’s
fire,” and that we had got them well burned
as we deserved. He declared that but for
the overseas troops they would have de-
feated the British Army and won the war.
With considerable warmth he insisted that


we had done ourselves great harm in earn-
ing the enmity of the Germans, who would
have Deen our good friends, and that we had
been used as a catspaw by the English,
who, as always in history, had made __ use
of other people to fight their battles. _ W bile
I strenuously deuied these contentions, I
thanked him for the implied compliment to
the A.I.F. . . ,
A much less excited officer from Munich
remarked that of course I knew that our
(Australian) infantry were their most-
feared enemies. He asked the number of
divisions we had, and was surprised when
I told him. He said that they met us so
often, and in so many different sectors, that
they had the idea that our numbers were
much greater than their headquarters
thought.
The military men professed to bear no
particular illwill to Great Britain or
America, but were verv venomous towards
the French. My remarks about the superior
tenacity of the French people, the better
fighting quality of the French soldiers and
the genius of French leadership invariably
caused the explosion I expected; and more
than once in typical Prussian manner I was
informed with a table-thuinping accompani-
ment that “the French swine would be
driven out of Europe”—that perhaps not
in five, but within 25, years Germany would
dictate peace in Paris. These soldier-people
claimed that we had not defeated the Ger-
man army. "We had gained the victory by
pressure brought upon the people by the
blockade. They acknowledged defeat, but
claimed the honors of the fighting. To my
remark that under those circumstances all
parties should be satisfied, the rejoinder
came that we had taken advantage of our
fortune to impose vindictive terms of pea.e
with the intention of destroying the German
nation.
Berlin is a great city, but the dirtiness of
its streets and its generally unkempt appear-
ance were a surprise to me. The city
seemed crowded, but the people were list-
less and seemed to be idling. Beer gardens
were well patronised, and picture aud other
shows I visited were well attended. Paper
money was plentiful, hut prices were high
find food was scarce. A stranger could not
buy breakfast. Coffee without milk and
with very little sugar was served, and
sometimes a boiled egg was procurable, but
no bread. Bread could only be obtained on
a ration card. Through the good offices of
a waiter who had,lived many years in Eng-
land and had two sons in our tank corps I
was provided with a lot of intersting infor-
mation about the condition of the German
people. The picture drawn was a very
dark one, and was in the main accurate, I
believe. Fear of another revolution on
account of food shortage was widespread.
One day all work stopped, and a monster
procession of Socialists paraded the city.
They carried banners with (to me) “strange
devices,” stopped frequently and said
“Hoch” in loud voices, and were escorted
every hundred yards or so by army motor-
lorries with a dozen soldiers in tin hats
and a machine-gun mounted on the front
seats. Under the trees in Untfcr den Lin-
den crowds of people listened to stump ora-
tors all day and most of the night.
On one occasion my companions showed
me where they had burned the French flags
in the square rather than deliver them up
as agreed under the peace treaty. My
remarks on the subject led to a very warm
argument. The revolutionaries had bom-
barded the Kaiser’s palace with a “wliiz-
bang” from the University, and had pushed
in the balcony from which the Kaiser was
wont to address the people. This end of
rhe Unter den Linden is the German White-
hall, I think. The buildings around were
pock-pitted with machine-gun bullets, and
the stables in rear of the palace had been
demolished by the loyal airmen. Llinden-
burg’s effigy was still surrounded by the
scaffold by which the people used to climb
up to drive nails into his wooden head. Many
shell-shocked and limbless soldiers were
begging in the streets. Some of the cases
were very pitiful. I asked of an officer why
these people were not looked after. “Where
are we to get the money? If we had won
it would be different,” he said. I agreed
that it would.
The fancy-goods shops and hardware
stores were well stocked, but the huge stores
of Tietz and Wertheim were nearly empty.
Boots with wooden soles and paper uppers
were on sale at from 30 to 70 marks; paper
and woollen suits. 300 marks; paper
dust-coats for ladies, dyed all colors. 30
marks. Gold Flake cigarettes (smuggled)
were on sale in the streets at 20 marks for
a tin of 50. Sunlight soap (also smuggled)
could be had at 25 marks for a small bar.
Lunch was IS marks and dinner 40 marks
at my hotel. (A mark used to be about
equal to our shilling.)
Except for the bitter feeling towards
France, all the German people I met seemed
anxious to let bygones be bygones. They
expressed horror at the terrible peace terms,
and profound sorrow and indignation at our
intention to try the ex-Kaiser. One officer,
nevertheless, admitted that if they had won
a harder peace would have been imposed
upon us, hut at the same time said that it
would be impossible to carry out the Allies’
terms. At no time was rudeness shown
me. and discussions, while frequently very
warm, were always impersonal; and when
I left Berlin half a dozen of those I had
met came to see me off, although the de-
parture was at midnight.
HAROLD RETCHFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Parties of Missed Opportunities.
“Ministers to be elected by Parliament.” — Clause 1
in the programme of the Democratic (Catholic
Federation) party for the N. S. Wales election.
March 20 may possibly be known in N. S.
Wales as the Day of Missed Opportunities.
There never before was an election with so
many new parties in it, or at least parties
that were new enough to call themselves new
and to claim that they were making a fresh
start, with no past to live down and no em-
barrassing commitments or old disreputable
friends. There was a streak of pathos in
their inability to be definite and upstanding.
The Democrats were as new as any. and
they threw their clod, but threw it feebly
and without conviction, at a big evil when
thev proposed the election of Ministers by
Parliament. The lack of detail spoiled the
idea. If it is proposed that the handtul ot
Parliamentarians should elect the Ministry
from among themselves, then there is a dis-
tinction but not enough difference to write
home about. Some 30 years ago the idea
looked like a reform, but since then State
Parliaments have grown smaller and State
Ministries larger, till at last it would be very
like a case of 12 constituencies electing 12
disciples who would choose 12 apostles from
among themselves. Then machine politics
have developed, and now the Ministry is
really elected, to all intents and purposes, by
secret caucus, so that the details of the sordid
bargaining may not be made public. Elec-
tion by the House would mean that the
caucus of the majority party, having done
its recriminations in private, would bring
its block vote into the House and cast it for
the men who were already selected in pri-
vate, and the situation would be neither
altered nor improved. By way of liberalis-
ing the system, all electors, inside and out-
side the House, might be made eligible for
Ministerial office, in which case the men in-
side would get office. The idea that mem-
bers would deliberately give away the loaves
and fishes is unthinkable. And if the selec-
tion of Ministers was confined, as in the
United States, to men outside the House, with
members making the selection, which is not
the U.S. style, it would probably only mean
that there would be portfolios to distribute
as rewards for party hacks as well as Agent-
Generalships, High Commissionerships,
trips to Europe, and such-like prizes. In
the present disarrangement of things, even if
Briggs has all the signs of an ideal
Treasurer for the whole State, he isn’t and
can’t be elected by the whole State, but only
by a fraction of it, and possibly a purely
agricultural fraction. Then he isn’t elected
as Treasurer, for no one knows whether acci-
dent may lead him to that office, but merely
as Briggs - , and the people who choose him
may be worse judges of Treasurers than they
are of camels. The position is so precarious
and uncertain that Briggs, being a man of
value and with a solid earning capacity,
seldom stands. In the United States the
difficulty is got over by the people electing
the head man for a stated term and letting
him appoint Ministers from the whole com-
munity of electors, members of Parliament
excepted. Probably the new Democratic
Party might not care for that solution of
the problem, but as a new organisation, with
all its future ahead, it should have laid out
its plan in detail, instead of taking refuge
in a platitude. Still, the Democratic crowd,
represented by “P. S. Cleary, President of
the Catholic Federation,” is rather above
the average amid a herd of Missed Oppor-
tunities. It at least realises vaguely that
something is wrong with the system that
enables the dullest clod in the community
and the most tinselly showman in the com-
munity to pose as the only possible appli-
cants for the Premiership—something wrong,
in fact, with Clod and Clown Government.
The Policy of Shuffle and Shirk.
Looking hack over yellowish newspaper files
of past years the investigator will be sur-
prised to find how recent is the familiar
and almost purely Australian platitude about
our amazing natural resources. They were
discovered or, rather, invented when the
loan boom became chronic and aggravated.
Lazy men who disliked the gospel of plain
work, and incapable men who didn’t know
how to organise industry, and corrupt men
ivho wanted money to buy votes with found
big loans a handy device with which to
keep their policies afloat. They served to
buy the roads-and-bridges and local-railway
member, and he bought his constituents
with them. Machine politics wiped him
out, for the machine wouldn’t let him
change his party whether he got his road
or not, and then the N. S. Wales roads
went to the dogs. But loans are now used
in a more promiscuous way than ever to
buy votes at large. It has to be professed
that the money is used wisely and honestly
and patriotically to develop something for
the advantage of posterity; that it isn’t the
mere handing down of a cruel, selfish load
to those who come after us; that it isn’t true
that much of it might as well be lavished
on a king’s mistress. And what better thing
could be developed than “the boundless,
natural resources”? John Storey, appli-
cant for the Premiership, says that in N. S.
Wales alone they are so vast that it is im-
possible to over-estimate them, which really
means that it is impossible to over-estimate
the amount John is prepared to borrow on
the pretence of developing them. He is
asking for votes and offering in return (1)
sickening flattery about the State’s rich-
ness, and (2) lots of borrowed development-
money to be spent among the people if they
vote hard enough to put him in office. Now,
what are these extra special resources when
it gets down to hard fact?
(1) N. S. Wales contains 130,468 square miles
of land with a 20in. rainfall. This area is a little
greater than that of the British Isles. The Western
Division covers 125,498 square miles, and is mostly
Government land from which is extracted an income
of about £91,000 a year—hardly enough to pay
for administration. It is flat, almost timberless,
scarce of raip; it grows no rivers, though rivers
flow into it from outside and often die in it. It
is not a coal or iron country nor much of a mineral
country except at one or two isolated spots. The
population of this part is almost nil, and attempts
to make it boom by railways have only resulted in
heavy loss.
(2) The estimated coal resources of the State are
large, but not nearly so large as those of Great
Britain and Ireland and not one-third those of Ger-
many. They are close to the coast, so they don’t
tend much to populate the interior. They are already
developed more than sufficiently to meet present
demand and don’t require John Storey’s loans.
The known or suspected iron reserves are very
moderate. The State has been raked for gold during
70 years and the industry has ceased to pay working
expenses. Nearly half the mineral production of
the State in 1917 ( £5,148,000 out of £12,563,000)
came from Broken Hill, and N. S. Wales makes little
out of it, the place being closer to both Adelaide
and Melbourne than to Sydney.
(3) Over two-thirds or perhaps three-fourths of
the State there is no water-power.
(4) Wheat is by far the biggest crop and is
grown on favored spots. The yield in good years is
between half and a third ot' an averasre Ena-lish crop,
and the industry has been in difficulties of late.
(5) The supply of good harbors is scanty but not
bad.
Any mine is a wild cat and a swindle when
it is boomed for twice or 25 or 100
times its value. Whether the promoter is
an enterprising - shark who wants the alleged
value of the cat for himself or is a humble
fraud whose ambition doesn’t soar above
the job of manager at £l5OO a year the
mean imposition upon the public is the
same. N. S. Wales is a fair but not extra-
ordinary business proposition, a consider-
able part of which will give very respectable
returns for honest toil. But a lot of slack-
mouthed inefficients, all applying for jobs
as manager or assistant manager, tell the
shareholders that it is the marvel of the
earth, but needs millions spent on it; and
the inefficients merely seek the job of rais-
ing and spending the millions. It is exactly
the same sort of swindle as the other.
The Golden Mendicant Again.
Difficult as it may oe to believe, West-
ralia, the wonderful “Golden Giant” of the
sunset side of Australia, seems to be as
serious as a statue of Confucius over its
project of “a vigorous developmental and
railway policy” in its empty northern parts
—the same to be paid for by the Common-
wealth ; that is to say, almost wholly by
its neighbors. What Westralia has got
already in the way of special concessions
include a separate tariff for a number of
years which yielded it well towards a
million, a grant of rather over £2,000,000,
and a railway (the only big railway that
the Commonwealth has built) which cost
about £7,000,000 and loses nearly £300,000
a year, a loss in which even remote States
like Queensland and Tasmania have to
share. There was an understanding that
Westralia would convert its Ivalgoorlie-
Perth line to the standard gauge, so that the
Federal express, on the railway which cost
£7,000,000 and loses nearly £300,000 a year,
might have a clear run through ; but so far
the Commonwealth has been let down. Then
Westralia deliberately keeps its State taxa-
tion to the lowest, and has thereby manu-
factured a long series of deficits. In fact,
a suspicion grows, in default of other ex-
planation, that it is quite willing to go
broke in the hope that the Commonwealth
may take over its debts and saddle part of
them on its neighbors to avoid a worse
crash. And now it is proposed that the
other States should “develop” its North-
West, just when interest and the prices of
labor and material are at their highest.
Though little is known about it, apparently
this country isn’t a patch for hopefulness
on the Northern Territory; and the Terri-
tory railway is a matter of developing the
Commonwealth’s own property, which is
strictly the Commonwealth’s business, while
the North-West project would be a case of
putting enormously expensive improvements
on another fellow’s selection. The Northern
Territory railway, even in its present
lamentable, unfinished state, with a great gap
in the middle, doesn’t lose so much good
Commonwealth money as the completed
transcontinental line over the desert to
Kalgoorlie, yet the latter is prosperous com-
pared with the present prospects of a line
in the North-West. The Commonwealth
has been diverted once already, through
the wiles of Westralian politicians and of one
Westralian politician in particular, from its
obvious first job of improving its own pro-
perty, and has gone improving Westralia
instead. If it is diterted a second time by
the bashful maiden in the West, who merely
asks for two immense Federal railways be-
fore any other State gets even one, it will
deserve to be suspected of being non compos
mentis. Westralia is the only State which
has acquired the idea on a really big scale
that its local “development” should be done
for it by its less auriferous neighbors. If,
at some future date, when urgent matters
have been attended to and money has become
cheaper, the Commonwealth should take a
hand at developing the North-West, the
Perth politicians should be out of it. They
are not on in that act. The extreme point
of Northern Westralia is about 1500 miles
from Perth as the crow goes, and there is
a desert in between. By any practicable
route it is much farther. The joke about
the N. S. Wales Northern Rivers being
ruled fi’om Sydney, or the Townsville dis-
trict from Brisbane, is mild and harmless
compared with the joke of the North-West
belonging permanently to Perth. It would
attach more naturally to Darwin, and the
tip of the country is really closer to Towns-
ville than to its own nominal metropolis.
For one reason and another the Federal
authorities should, therefore, refuse to hold
any converse with Perth politicians on the
matter, though when their own line is com-
plete to Darwin they might go into con-
clave with their railway manager about ex-
tensions in the Kimberley district, provided
the place was handed over, or some other
satisfactory arrangements were made. It is
stated that the proposed huge job receive?
support at Perth from “politicians irrespec-
tive of party and business men.” Naturally
it would. A proposal for subsidising beer,
out of Commonwealth revenue, would receive
support in almost any brewery.

“Why I Should Be in Parliament.”
Because The Bulletin believes that the
half-million women of N. S. Wales should
have a voice in Parliament it asked Grace
Scobie, a candidate for East Sydney, and
Dr. Mary Booth (North Shore), to say
why they should be in the Assembly. First
it prints Miss Scobie’s answer:—
In the Parliament of the State, at this crisis in
history, there is imperative need for earnest and
faithful service from capable men and women—
men and women who will have, and will hold
through all emergencies, sufficient moral strength
to set aside all sordid self-interest, to devote them-
selves whole-heartedly to the advancement of the
heritage that is ours, a heritage bought and held
for us by blood and sacrifice. On the altars of sacri-
fice the blood of our best has been poured out lavishly.
But the final ransom is not paid, the end is not
yet, and only further, though lesser, sacrifices on
our part will enable us to realise those high ideals
of nationhood for which our soldiers fought and
died.
My father “saw visions and dreamed dreams,”
and in his intense desire to serve his country and
his fellow-creatures he worked unceasingly to
bring those dreams to realisation. His daughter
inherits a goodly portion of his fanaticism, and is
equally prepared to work for the realisation of her
aspirations.
As a citizen of Australia I claim the right, equally
with men, to speak with authority for my country
and my State, especially on those matters which
so-called statesmen have neglected. I know the
Commonwealth fairly well. Years of my life were
spent in the Far West, and I know that portion
of this State intimately—fits drawbacks and its
possibilities and its needs. Travelling throughout
the wheat-growing country in 1917, I saw with
my own eyes the primitive handling and wicked
waste of our food. The industrial problems of the
State I have studied at first hand, as nsy daily
work for some years has brought me in contact
with industrialists of all classes, and particularly
with women. I am familiar with the working
conditions which prevail to-day, and am conversant
with the more or less divergent viewpoints of em-
plover and employed. As a Voluntary Aid, working
under the Red Cross during the influenza scourge,
I acquired an intimate knowledge of the housing
conditions in some of the congested areas, and it
is no exaggeration to class those conditions as not
merely a disgrace to New South Wales but a
blot on civilisation.
For the children under the care of the State I
can speak with the knowledge begotten of years
on the State Children Relief Board; and I feel
that, could I speak with the authority of a
legislator, I could help those children considerably.
And last, but not least, I claim that women by
their work, sacrifice and silent endurance through
the whole agony of the war have earned the
right, if they establish their capacity, to be heard
in all those problems of reconstruction which now
face the community.
Dr. Mary Booth (North Shore) puts it this
way:—
Friends and acquaintances, men and women alike,
have been so insistent during the past year that
at last I began to like the idea, and now I want to
be there more than anything. Men mostly urged
that Parliament was in about as bad a way as it
could be, and the sooner women got in the sooner
there would be a hope for improvement. Some men,
however, urged that it was too bad a place for any
woman to be in. Being a woman, this naturally
made it appeal to me the more. Women have a love
of decency and order, and when things go wrong they
cannot bear to stand around and look on without
trying to straighten them out.
There is also a love of country, especially this
young one, with all its life before it, that makes
a woman want to do what she. can to help give it
a chance.
Women urged in addition that until a woman was
in Parliament the claims of women could not be
heard. Although men and women played different,
albeit complementary, parts in the social structure,
yet the framing of the structure was made by men
only. Laws were made and administered by men,
and women influenced them not at all. Further,
those laws were more and more tending to interfere
with personal liberty, and their administration fell
with heavier incidence upon the women than the
men. For instance, the ill-digested, inoperative
Venereal Diseases Act of the late Government.
So, the way being opened by the passing of the
Women’s Legal Status Act of 1918, and a warm
invitation to stand waiting from men who frankly
admitted that it had taken the best efforts of both
men and women to pull through the war, and who
had come to believe, what every woman knows, that
women had made good in national affairs as well
as the home, it was essential for the prosperity arid
progress of our country in the future that women
should not be denied the opportunity to continue
their efforts for the common good.
I have always taken a keen interest in the forward
movement of women, believing that women, being half
of the human family, should manage in their own way
those affairs which touch their sex, both in private
and in public life. Legislation becomes more and more
of a domestic and social nature and bears closely on
the lives of the women. The centre of gravity of
child-life has swung from the fireside across the
threshold into the hands of the State, and it is
natural that the woman should desire to have a voice
in influencing the environment of the growing child,
youth and young man and woman. As a member of
Parliament I should hope to get women represented
on all public bodies and committees where the in-
terests of men and women are equal and need atten-
tion, and particularly where children are concerned.
The nature of present-day legislation demands a
woman on the floor of the House. It is a more
dignified position for a woman to state her case
directly there than that small coteries of women
should, metaphorically, pull strings behind the scenes
or have to beat up fellow-citizens to place their
requests before, oftentimes, an unwilling, indifferent
or contemptuous Minister.
There are also the reasons of abstract justice—
because women pay taxes, are amenable to the laws,
constitute about 50 p.c. of the population—that are
obvious and need not be stressed. If all that women
might contribute to the welfare of the State is to
be jettisoned and men only to control its destinies,
then the outlook for Australia is a poor one indeed.
Saturday’s election will be a great test of the
courage of our people, whether we are going to cow
at the crack of the Holman whip and vote for the
party machine which has well-nigh paralysed the
country, or whether we are going to exercise to
the full the free choice permitted us by the preferen-
tial voting system, and elect men and women for
the good of the country. The election of a woman
of independent views will be the outward and visible
sign that we are free Australians and not party pup-
pets.
Does the Court-Martial System Deserve
to Live?
An A.I.F. Colonel appears for the defence:
A good deal has been written lately about courts-
martial and the way they were conducted in the
A.I.F. Most of the senior officers who acted as
presidents of courts-martial were men of long mili-
tary experience, and in pre-war days were, as C.M.F.
officers, students of military law and King’s Regula-
tions. A civil lawyer’s course at the University takes
about three years, and if a citizen officer couldn’t
learn all that was necessary to know about military
law and King’s Regs, in the same time he generally
didn’t have enough brains to go far as an A.I.F.
officer and seldom reached field rank. Presidents of
even field general courts were never below the rank
of major, and if an A.I.F. combatant major wasn t
as capable of conducting a trial as an inexperienced
fledgling lawyer dressed up as a soldier well, be
was an exception, that’s all. Even if the president
and members of a. court were as ignorant as alleged,
the reviewing officers at brigade and divisional head-
quarters were experts in military law, and no harm
could be done until the sentences and findings were
confirmed by higher authority. Then what about
the D.A.J.A.G. (Deputy-Assistant Judge Advocate-
General) ? It was the job of this much be-lettered

lawyer, who harl the filial say, toi spend all' Ins time,'
with an army ol'clevks, in pulling eases to pieces
and trying to quash them. Take it from me, the
Digger had as fair a trial when he wandered from
the narrow path as man ever had, and the officers
who sat in judgment in 09 p.c. of cases were his
sympathisers and friends.
During 44 years of foot-slogging with the A.I.F. 1
met several lawyers, and these briefly are some of
their achievements: —
(1) Went out with an A.S.O. unit in 1916; after-
wards to a divisional headquarters as a court-martial
expert. Got the M.C. for bravery, too.
(2) Got as far as England late in 1917, where lie
became an acting staff-sergeant doing court-martial
work. He formulated charges, then acted as
prisoner’s friend to the accused —with great success
until the game was spotted. Then he got a quick
trip back to Australia. His unauthorised fees must
have amounted to a good sum.
(8) Went out in 1917, but never got further than
England, where he found a job as an educationist.
(4) Reached Egypt after the Evacuation, went
into the line once in France. Pined for a safer job,
and became a staff-captain.
There are others — Blackburn, V.C., and Gordon’
Oamubkll, M.U. and Bar, who kept their civil pro-
fession quiet, aiid were content to be damn good sol-
diers.
On which a lawyer who was just a Digger
observes: —•
In the first place, “most of the senior officers who
acted as presidents of courts-martial” were em-
phatically not men who in pre-war days had been
“students of military law and King’s Regulations.
In the field they were such men as Murray, V.C. —
magnificent soldiers, but neither students nor lawyers.
There was a proportion of ex-C.M.F. officers who
might have been expected to be more or less expert
in military law. It is notorious, however, that
most of them were not. “Fighting Charlie” Cox
was a very senior ex-C.M.F. officer and an excellent
soldier—but he was no learned Judge. Many of the
best of the combatant majors to whom reference is
made were ex-Duntrooners. They laid a smattering
of law, but knew nothing of the complicated rules
of evidence and procedure which are at tin- basis
of the administration of British justice; and most
of them freely admitted it. In any case they were
too young to sit on any bench; a ini outside the
Army no one would have allowed them to do so.
The Great War has proved nothing more clearly
than that soldiering is. not one. of the intellectual
professions-—up. to, and perhaps including, the rank
of brigadier. Yet, under the idiotic old system which
we adopted from England, men who had risen by
bravery, physical energy, luck and the gift of com-
mand were pitchforked into the highly technical
business of sifting evidence and deciding on legal
points-4-rnatters in respect of which such a Judge as
Griffith professed himself a learner to the end of
his career. Few of these officers knew even their
“Red Book” ; and there was no more lamentable
spectacle than that which most members of the
A.I.F. have witnessed in one capacity or another—
a. colonel, or other senior officer, laboriously checking
himself by his “Manual” at each stage of the
simplest proceedings. The choice should not have
been between, such incompetents and “inexperienced
fledgling lawyers.” Trained Judges should have
been substituted for them. Just as there was a
Medical Corps to look after the men’s, health, there
should have been a legal corps to safeguard their
reputation.
The D.A.J.A.G.’s department no doubt rectified
many injustices, but only where the prisoner wa-
defended by a skilled advocate who was in a position
to have bis objections, noted on the proceedings.
Illegalities in evidence.and procedure did not appear
otherwise on the documents which went up to the
confirming authority from D.C.-M.’s; and Field
General C.-M.’s refused to note objections for refer-
ence to H.Q. Nothing is surer than that, in any
future war in which Australia participates, the
ancient superstition that men become fitted to wear
the ermine by their success with the bomb, will
have to go. Lawyer-specialists will go to the Front
side by side with doctor and dentist and veterinary
specialists. And the moral of the Army will be
wonderfully raised thereby.
The Colonel’s remarks about the shirking lawyers
he has met have, of course, nothing to do with the
question. Naturally there were cold-footed -and
generally useless lawyers in the A.I.F. — and auc-
tioneers and bagmen and commission agents and
professional soldiers. It is a. point which the
judicial as distinguished from what might be called
the colonel mind would take as read.
A Word About Sardine-tins.
Even Augustus James, N. S. Wales Minis-
ter for Education, admits the school accommo-
dation provided by his State is appallingly
inadequate. Blit a vague acknowledgment
of that sort will not move the public from
i-ts apathy. Perhaps some hard facts about
accommodation, equipment and staffing may
help parents to realise what is happening
to their children :
(1) In the best-equipped and largest schools in
N. S. Wales the average attendance for each class
works out at about 59.7. Yet the most capable of
teachers cannot handle efficiently more than 30
children at once.
(2) In many schools, one room accommodates two
classes—-one class walks in for a written lesson, the
other walks out for an oral lesson given on a wind-
swept verandah or in a dusty, sun-baked weather-
shed.
(3) In many large schools there is no special
sewing-room. The. result is a chaotic shifting about
of classes at each change of lesson.
(4) Teachers’ rooms—poky little places where
lunches are sometimes swallowed —are utilised as
ilass-rooms. The teachers bolt their food in the
stench of their classrooms —how sickening that
stencli becomes in these overcrowded rooms only
teachers know.
(5) In many large schools classes are herded per-
manently into weather-sheds. There are no desks —
some of the children kneel at a form, others sprawl
on the floors when they have to write.
(0) In some schools two classes are crammed inti,
the weather-shed.
(7) There is no room at all for some classes.
The children work outside, and when rain comes they
are brought into a corridor.
(8) The desks fitted into classrooms have to seat
three instead of two children. The unfortunate
third cliild sits in an unhygienic position all day
long. “Order” can only be kept by the liberal use
of the • cane.
Such overcrowded conditions in a shop or
factory would lead to the employer being
promptly and heavily fined. Shearers last year
demanded proper rooms in which to rest
and eat. But the children, not having votes
or a union, must suffer in health and
mentality—because money cannot be found
for the most important business in the
world, which is education. It can be found
EGOTISM.
“There "ill be ample choice for the electors. North Sydney heads the list with 21 candidate-,
while the Western Suburbs runs close with 20.”
THE HEIRESS : "Heavens! I didn't thinly there were so many handsome gents, in the
world!”
for other things, many of them quite un-
worthy. That there is none for the schools
is a disgrace, not only to the politicians, but
to the parents, who submit to the politicians’
neglect. And it becomes a question whether
it is not a disgrace to the teachers also.
They know the conditions; and they cannot
retain their self-respect as teachers without
letting the public know too.
“Ace E”: Who is “A Lawyer” who wrote
about “Judges and Lawyers” (B. 4/3/’2O)
and what’s his trouble, anyhow? Didn’t
he get a fair cut out of the extra briefs
going round subsequent to one of his
brethren at the Bar going up to the Bench?
Does he seriously ask us to believe that the
appointment of any barrister to a judgeship
is accelerated because his sordid and ghoul-
ish brethren, as a body, pull the necessary
strings to get him out of the way so that
they may divide his fees amongst them-
selves? As far as Victoria is concerned,
Judges have been recently appointed both
to the Supreme Court and County Court
Benches for one reason only—they were
urgently required to relieve the congestion
of the cause lists in both courts. The best
men available were chosen because of
(a) their undoubted integrity, and (b)
their legal qualifications. , It seems
to me the best Judge is the one
who knows the most law and who admini-
sters that law honestly. The best men at
the Bar know the most law, and accordingly
hold the most briefs and get the biggest
fees. Litigants and their solicitors know
these men and brief them in their cases
for very obvious reasons. Bad lawyers don’t
get the best briefs because bad lawyers don’t
get results. Of all professions there is none
so hard to get a footing in as the legal
profession—ask the juniors who are waiting
for briefs —and when the briefs do come
along, that is pretty conclusive evidence
that the man has shown himself to know
something about the goods in which he
traffics.
“Gwy” on sweets, with something bitter in
the tail: —
“H.H.” (B. 22/l/’2O) is on the right track in lu-
re marks on the Australian confectionery industry;
but the fact is that at the moment the embargo on
imported sweets isn’t essential to our makers. For
the past couple of years at least they have been
able to undersell the foreign stuff; wholesale quota-
tions in British trade journals for standard lines
have been as high as Australian retail prices, even
higher. One Melbourne firm actually sold a -hip-
ment wholesale to the Cold Land at the equivalent
of local, retail prices. Even small manufacturers
here have had inquiries from all over the place—
S’Africa, Asia and the Pacific generally. One man
I know has done nice business in high-class choco-
lates with the East Indies, and instances could be
multiplied. Export possibilities, in fact, have only
been limited by the capacity of our factories; and
here manufacturers, I think, have been wise in
making local needs their first, concern. Even then
the infernal strike nuisance, plus the sugar shortage,
lias given some Australian retailers an excuse for
letting in the imported article. One can’t blame
the retailers altogether, seeing that their living
depends on a regular supply, and imported stuff,
even at tall prices, has given them something to sell.
Incidentally, the point shows how short-sighted the
Australian worker is to listen to the mostly-imported
strike-manufacturer, and assist'- to destroy his own
industries. There are enough foreign-trade politicians
left to be glad to give the excuse that the Aus-
tralian manufacturer can’t supply his own market,
and not in this line only; and the shipping hold-up
has . also played Hades with distribution. The sheet
anchor of the Australian confectionery industry, of
course, has been cheap sugar, compared with the
rest of the world —£27 a ton as against £7O or
£BO elsewhere. But this is coming to an end,
and if we don’t need that embargo now we shall
then. Hughes was patting himself on the back
all through the recent election campaign for his
cleverness in securing cheap Java sugar; but the
latest is that he wasn’t clever enough. The Federal
Government was advised months ago to buy -more,
■as the price 'was going up, but it did nothing. It
was warned again, but let the chance slip. The
result is that we have come to the end of the eheap-
sugar era, and the Government i- desperately post-
poning the announcement of prices which will make
consumers surge.
When a new l’ailiaruent meets the first
business is to appoint a Speaker and the
next to elect the House’s humorist. Moses
Gabb, the new 31.11.1 t. for Angas (S.A.).
was chosen on the voices. As soon as lie
explained that he was naturally a green-
grocer with a religious training, and told of
his feelings when Mrs. Gabb's last infant
was born, the House took Moses to its
bosom.
Japan is reported to be on the edge of a
very big fuss. The isles are ruled by: (1 *
The Emperor, who is sacred, of very
ancient alleged pedigree, and has power lo
make war, peace and treaties; (2) the
Council of Elder Statesmen, which has no
defined legal standing but assumes so much
power that the nation can’t stand it much
longer; (3) the House of Peers; (4) the
House of Reps., for which about 3 per
cent, of the people have votes. The Minister
for War and Minister for the Navy have
to be experts—high officers in their re-
spective services. If the Emperor dislikes
a proposed new Ministry he forbids any high
officer to act, which as head of both services
he can do. In that case, the proposed new
Ministry doesn’t happen. Except in these
and a few other matters. Nippon lias Par-
liamentary institutions so like Australia's
that a Bolshevik or other Direct Actionary
wouldn’t recognise the difference.
Maoriland daily papers have moved up to 2d ;
and the Australian reptiles will follow. And
2d. won’t see them through their troubles
either. The Freetraders amongst them must
be having some heart-to-heart talks with
themselves. In the absence of mills in Aus-
tralia all publications in the Commonwealth
and Maoriland have depended for supplies
upon North America and Scandinavia, or
upon British mills using Scandinavian pulp.
When the dollar value of English and Aus-
tralian money fell so that a pound bought
only 14s. worth of American goods, Aus-
tralian papers rushed to European mills.
But those magnificent profiteers are now
fixing their prices as though the pound was
worth only 14s. to them too. And of course
the Australian buyer is helpless; and the
threats of Hughes or Ityan. of Holman or
Storey, to deal with the profiteer don’t
trouble them at all. So the Australian
newspaper is now paying £lOO for what even
towards the end of the war cost only about
£4v>; and that was over three times more
than the normal price before the war.
. When the Unspeakable Turk is in doubt
he murders a Christian, just as the unspeak-
able Australian Premier mortgages a Chris-
tian. Even when the fate of Constantinople
was in the balance and he was on his best
behavior he couldn’t help breaking loose,
and the recent slayings in Cilicia haven’t
improved his chances. When Abdul Dammit
came to the throne in 1875 he noticed that
all the conquered Christian races save two
bad broken away, to the great diminution of
the empire, so lie decided to extirpate these
two—the Armenians and Bulgarians-—to pre-
vent further controversy. That made trouble.
The Young Turks started on a different
basis. They said, quite reasonablv. that
Mohammedans and Christians of all sorts
would probably live in harmony if they en-
joyed the bond of a common language. They
weren’t religious fanatics like Dammit, but
nation-builders. So they ordered that every-
body should speak Turkish, a harsh, jangled,
scanty speech that most of them didn’t know
and didn’t want to know. And at the first
sign of difficulty the Reformers lost their
block over uniformity of language just as
badly as the l uniformed did over uniformity
of religion.
“Ace E.” on the Vic. Bench and Bar: —
rile man who said (B. 26/2/’2o') that Schutt and
Mann are Judges of “middling ability” should think
again and do it better. The fact is they are both
men of first-rate ability, and either of them, as an
all-round lawyer, is at least the equal of Irvine, and
can knock spots off the suave and genial McArthur,
who was chiefly a jury man when at the Bar. As to
the alleged weakness of that Bar, Stanley Lewis,
Owen Dixon, C. J. Lowe, Piggott, Hayes and Cohen
are all sound men with large practices. Leo Cussen,
who is referred to as if he were a youth, has had
years of experience at the Bar, and adds a sound
legal knowledge to a very striking personality.
Morley’s delusion is a delusion all right, but not one
on his part. He is an affable, courteous man who
can, and does, deliver the forensic goods in proper
condition. Bryant may l>e good, or he may not; in
any event, in these days he is not as popular amongst
solicitors as many other members of' the Bar, and
solicitors know the men who get verdicts. Finally,
it didn’t take any alleged convention against pro-
moting County Court Judges to keep Waslev where
he was when Schutt and Mann were available for
the Supreme Court Bench. These two got the billets
on their merits, and in general experience and par-
ticularly as pleaders in the Supreme Court are both
far ahead of Wasley, who is undoubtedly a good
County Court Judge by reason of the fact that
when he was at the Bar he was chiefly a County
Court practitioner.

POLITICA
POINTS
Hughes’s look of mild astonishment is one
of his assets, and he put it on when the
Country Party suggested that the House
really ought to have some say about the
nation’s money. The financial year begins
on July 1, and within a few weeks at
latest a polite and efficient Treasurer would
bring along the Estimates and explain what
he intended to spend. March found Hughes
asking for another lump sum sufficient to
last three months, but still withholding par-
ticulars. And when a complaint was made
the short, shocked man said that about
June, when 95 per cent, of the money was
spent beyond recall, the Legislature would
have “ample opportunity to express its
opinion as to the expenditure of every
penny.” Also, which is quite as useful, it
will have ample opportunity to express its
views about the siege of Troy.
N. S. Wales will have the first election
under its new system on Saturday, and every
voter -will be required to number every can-
didate for his district in the order he (or
she) prefers him (or her). That, anyhow, is
the theory; but in practice the party slave
will give the weakest man on his party ticket
his first vote; and after he has voted for all
of the candi-
dates on his
party ticket he
will proceed to
give his next
votes to what
he regards as
the most hope-
less ca ndidates
on the list. To
some extent the
system pr e-
scribed for
counting votes
will defeat his
plans; but that
won’t alter the
inherent d i s-
honesty of the
strict party-
voter’s proceed-
ing.
J.S. GARDEN,
Secretary of
the Sydney
Labor Council.
The current gossip of the lobbies: —
Rumor alleges that the Country II in the Reps,
will drop its attitude of isolation and stand up in
alliance with the Nationalist party. The recent
decision on Supply, when Hughes saved his bacon
hy the vote of the Independent Francis and the
unexpected help of Higgs and Weinholt, was too
close to a crisis and another election to please the
Corner, and they will probably welcome an under-
standing that will give them a chance to register
their views in Cabinet. The prospect of a coalition
is not so remote, considering that both crowds
cherish above their little antagonisms a deadly fear
of the’ Labor party. Funk makes ententes, and
Hughes won’t be the Willie he was if he doesn’t
develop the situation to his own advantage. He
will readily drop two or three of his team to share
the Government with the Cockies, and McWilliams,
Gregory or even Jowett would hesitate before re-
fusing a portfolio offered as the price of mutual
preservation.
Some unwise people in Queensland pro-
pose sending a deputation to London to
complain of the freaks of the party in
power, and the equally unwise Premier is
angry about it: —
If the delegation proposes to attempt to influ-
ence the people of England against investing their
money in Queensland, or proposes to take any other
action which will damage the credit of this State,
Queenslanders can only regard such action as being
nothing short of treachery.
There Theodore makes a blunder. Patriotism
doesn’t consist in the multiplication of
absentee landlords and absentee usurers,
though men like himself and Ryan and
Holman and Storey seem to think it does.
A man who cracks up his country and its
“natural resources” in the hope of beguil-
ing a foreigner to lend more money on it
is not much better than a brother who
might descant on the beauty of a sister
with the purpose of selling her.
Minahan, the Sydney Parliamentary Labor
candidate who recently talked about a revolu-
tion and a republic, says that it was “a
local joke.” It probably was a lie. But.
it was just the sort of talk that has for the
time being ruined the Labor movement in
Australia. No place-hunter tells the plain
truth to the Labor rank and file. Each vies
with the other in tickling the ears of the
crowd; so that the more the crowd hears
the less it knows. As The Bulletin has
said often, the old disastrous sycophancy,
the old disastrous grovelling to royalty and
rank, has been succeeded by a sycophancy
that is even more disastrous —grovelling co
the crowd in order to win place and power
through its votes.
“A large number of unemployed again
marched to the Treasury Buildings yesterday
to further urge their claim to em-
ployment,” said the Sydney papers
last week, and Holman replied that
public works loan-jobs of some sort
would be found. Why public
works? Brickmaking is no harder
to learn than railway building, and
N. S. Wales needs at least 2597
more brickmakers, for the 2597 it
has made only about half the bricks
during the last year covered by tbe
statistics that were made before
the great go-slow, and even then
the supply was short. And returns
would come iu immediately, where-
as no one knows for 10 years
whether a big dam will be a gold-
mine or a bankruptcy schedule.
The N. S. Wales Local Government Act —
just passed, and the most gigantic Act in the
State —provides that all municipal loans,
old and new, must have a sinking fund
attached to extinguish them in 80 years.
Presumably Holman and his party enacted
this because they knew it w r as the right and
honest thing to do. So by their own showing
they are doing the Wrong and dishonest
thing with their own loans. If this arises
from incapacity they should be sacked; if
from wickedness a worse thing should happen
to them. A Premier who enacts that the
Mayor of Mullumbimby must be more upright
than himself is too ridiculous for words.
Bananaland’s Acting Premier Fihelly took
exactly three days after Theodore’s departure
to shuffle the railway portfolio from his neck,
or wherever he kept it. Since his return
from America last year, his chief aim has
been to rid himself of this millstone. The
unions have got such a stranglehold on the
railways that to make them a success Fihelly
would have had to sacrifice his popularity,
which meant political suicide. Theodore
alone kept him at the job. There is not
one member of the Cabinet game to tackle
the Department with the idea of showing a
profit, so Larcombe, being the youngest, is
shoved on to it
Minahan and Scott Campbell, the latest
additions to the Expelled Laborites’ Union,
went out for signing a pledge that they
would stand for the immediate release of
the I.W.W. prisoners whom three Courts
found guilty. But they didn’t go out on a
charge of sympathising with crime or pros-
tituting justice. They went out for damag-
ing the Prussian discipline of the drill-
masters of the party by having opinions that
weren’t on the schedule. At one time a
•Laborite, while he was required to have all
the views on the schedule, could have as
many more as ho liked provided they didn’t
clash. Now he must have the views on the
schedide and no more. And if the bill of
fare is short of ideas he must also be short.
Almost all the expulsions during the last
four years have been for thinking too many
thoughts.
Senator Earle (Tas.) suggests a referen-
dum of the people of N. S. Wales to see
whether they will “release the Commonwealth
from its obligation to build the Federal capi-
tal at Canberra.” But the Commonwealth
is under no obligation to build a capital at
Dryberra, so it doesn’t require to be released.
And if there is to be a referendum it ought
to be one of all Australia, for the capital is
to be all Australia’s capital. Dryberra isn’t
fixed by the Constitution, or by referendum,
but by a mere Act of Parliament ; and that
Act shouts loudly for repeal, the thing hav-
ing been a smelliul job from the beginning.
Little more than a year ago there were
giddy folk who talked of earmarking our
share of the Hun indemnity for all manner
of purposes and even of borrowing from J.
Bull on the strength of it. Some went down
to the shore on fine mornings to see if the
ship loaded with indemnity was in sight,
intending to take their share home with
them. Now the partially re-armed Hun
demands a loan of £2,100,000,000 in gold and
declares that if he doesn’t get it he will go
bankrupt and be quite unable to pay any
indemnity. If he gets it he may not pay
either. Nothing short of the burning of
Berlin is likely to convince Fritz that he
doesn’t boss the world still. And the trouble
is that possibly he does.
“Gordon’s’: Higgs’s is a case which makes
very plain our need of the Recall. Capri-
eornia elected him (then deputy-leader of
the Labor party) as a Labor man and
rejected the nominee of the Hughes Govern-
ment ; yet on the first crucial division he
voted with that Government. Whatever may
have been the unreason of the A.L.P.
Executive, Higgs is not thereby relieved of
responsibility to his constituents, and there
is neither logic nor decency in affronting
them because he has fallen out with a clique
of tyrannical fools. The insane policy of
complete party unity may have forced Higgs
into a bad position, but he cannot vote to
support the Hughes Governmept without dis-
franchising his constituents. The Recall is
THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND.
THE CUSTOMER: "When will you he able to
supply those goods I ordered, Grocer?”
THE GROCER: “We expect to have a plenti-
ful supply, ma'am, when the Prices
Commission has given its consent to
raise the prices.”
the only remedy in such emergency. A
further happy result would be the disabling
of dangerous party cliques which seek—as
sometimes does the A.L.P. Executive—to
interpose their disreputable authority
between the member and the people who
elect him to Parliament.
Tie. Parliamentary recess has been
stretched out till April 20, and will then
be further extended. It is possible that
there will be a brief special session to put
through an address to the princelet just be-
fore he arrives, as was done when his grand-
uncle came 58 years ago. Feeling then ran
high among politicians over the Darling
grant, but hostilities were suspended for a
couple of weeks or so. The special session
that passed tiie slobberv address on Nov.
25, 1867, remains a record. It lasted only
an hour.
The wrongs of Tasmania will be bellowed
into the ears of other Staters in the Reps,
this session. Atkinson* M.H.R., has already
had an unexpected upheaval and hinted that
if his native land is not more generously
treated it will cut the painter some night
and start life afresh as an independent
dominion. If the islet does break away,
it is understood that it will hang a cowbell
around its neck so that the mainland may
find it when it wants to rejoin the Federa-
tion.
The old bogey of ‘‘splitting the vote” has
been worked harder than ever this N. S.
Wales election, and by the very people who
introduced proportional representation. Hol-
man has been a special offender: the country
has been warned, in the interests of the
Nationalists, against “splitting the vote and
allowing the Labor party to get in.” Of
course, if the Nationalist Ministry mis-
behaves, the other
sections can join
to put the Labor
party in; but the
idea that the
Nationalists must
have a majority in
the House in
order to keep a
Labor Government
out is just as ridi-
culous as it would
have been to say
that it was neces-
sary for Belgium
to be able to lick
Germany in order
to secure a Ger-
man defeat.

Things are not running smoothly inside
the Queensland Labor movement. That ex-
plains why the other day the Brisbane Labor
Council asked the Government to in future
submit all proposed labor legislation for
endorsement, amendment or otherwise. And
the Central Political Executive recently
called its Parliamentarians over the coals.
The position outside doesn’t improve, either
The C.P.E. does its best with a permanent
organiser and lecturer in the lield; and the
Standard headlines the Ministers every
time they .sneeze in public. But this doesn’t
turn the bag humpies and motor-cases of
Cannon Hill and MurrariO into decent
houses. Nor does a penny saved on a pound
of State meat compensate for the extraordi-
narily high price of fruit, etc. Besides, outside
the suburban radius there are no butchers’
shops at all. They have been squeezed out.
And when a housewife has to pay a train-
fare to get her meat the cheapness of it is a
myth.
J. Bull cabled that he had included
£8,750,000 of Australia’s floating war-debt
among his receipts for the year to March 81
and would be glad to see the money. The
message probably meant several things. Aus-
tralia is not only shamefully in arrear with
its pay for the maintenance of its troops,
but it has made no effort to provide the
money, and Treasurers are swarming home
to ask for more money for more unpayable
works. The British Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer recently declared that the immovable
law of his country was “No More Foreign
Borrowing.” That was a broad hint to Aus-
tralia. When U.S. politicians think their
hold on the Old Man in London so solid that
they begin to talk of taking over his West
Indies in part payment (they haven't sug-
gested Australia as part payment yet),
plainly the Old Man hasn’t much to spend
on prodigal Commonwealths.
Peake (S.A.) is having more trouble to
keep his bundle intact. The Liberal
Leader, the Coalition patty’s weakly
monthly production, has an article on “Pro-
ducers and Parliamentary Representation.”
The Farmers and Settlers’ Assoc, has form-
ally asked the Liberal Union to sav whether
it endorses or repudiates the article: if the
reply is not satisfactory, it threatens to run
“direct farmers’ candidates” for all possible
seats at tne next elections.
Power alcohol is a great example of the
Hughes Government’s encouragement of local
industries. Two years ago the Institute of
Science and Industry advised the Govern-
ment to give a bonus to encourage the pro-
duction of alcohol in Australia. The Govern-
ment didn’t care for the bonus idea, but it
did better—it shoved on an excise duty of
Is. a gallon to give any intending manufac-
turer something to work for! Another com-
mittee appointed by the Institute started to
go into the question of getting liquid fuel
from the distillation of coal. Given some
means of recovering effectively and economi-
cally the volatile by-products which are now
wasted, these would be worth a lot more
than the present total value of the coal at
the pit’s mouth, and there would still be
the carbonised product far superior in many
respects to coal. But w r hen the committee
wanted a few hundred pounds to put a good
chemist on the job, it could not get it, and
the thing fell through. Pearce’s trip, and
the trip of Pearce’s family, didn’t.
BATTLE ROYAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Crowded galleries attended to hear the debates
in which Mr. Ryan condemned the Government and
Mr. Hughes defended its policy and actions.”
The Mace was shining like the sun,
His gayest wig the Speaker wore;
There was a hush on every one,
And clean new carpet on the floor.
The way was cleared, the lists were free
For Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The champions came; one small, one great.
A buzz went round the meeting-place.
Then Tweedledee, the man of weight,
With passion written on his face,
Spoke out his challenge dark and glum
And his disgust at Tweedledum.
He gibed at this, threw scorn at that,
And branded him a fool —-or worse.
He beat his small opponent flat;
Men waited for the needed hearse.
But Tweedledum arose and he
Struck sturdy blows at Tweedledee.
His rival’s record he laid bare,
And flourished an unblemished blade;
He pulled his foeman’s nose and hair,
And went triumphant from the raid,
Laughing with Quilpish, impish glee
At what remained of Tweedledee.
But some spectators-,—foolish blokes—
Thinking that work might do more good,
Muttered the fight was but a hoax
Which would not help us through the wood—
That deeds, not words, alone should come
From Twdeeledee and Tweedledum!

Probably no other published accounts demon-
strate so effectively what has happened in
N. S. Wales 'during recent years. The table
goes back to just before a Labor Ministry
set out to buy popularity with a public
works programme financed out of loans.
Gradually the loan boom was accelerated,
until in 1914 no less than nine millions-odd of
loans were spent on public works, the total
loan expenditure during the five years to
that date being nearly 29i millions. The
spending of a big lump of these loans in
Sydney soon made many people feel better
off, so R. and W., Ltd!, found a widening
circle of buyers, and after three years of
McGowen-Holman finance was able 10
double its profits. Everything went well
with the co. for a time, and then the war
put a stop to dealing and profits slumped;
not because of hard times, for about the
greatest hardship the Commonwealth suffered
was the disappearance of many familiar
brands of imported goods. The uncertain
future made the speculative value of land
obscure, so there was a lull; but when it
became clear that there was no prospect of
our acquiring the Kaiser as a landlord the
timid began to plunge again. The oppor-
tunity had been well prepared by the Com-
monwealth Government, whose war-finance
had created all the conditions necessary for
a boom. So it was not surprising that the
real-estate chronicler should have been able
to label ye rations as “remark-
able.” The published figures of sales
effected in and around'.>Sydney disclosed a
turnover «f well over six milL'ons
R. and -W(, Ltd., handled about £1,150,000.
Here is a record of the co„’s earnings during
the past 10 years, and a comparison of the
amounts of deposits held on pending con-
tracts each year:—

1918 . . . . . 20,021 5,869
1919 . . . . . . 27,656 23,947
That £23,947 of deposits on sales gives a
good idea of th,e amount of business tiie co.
was handling when the current year began;
and so far the boom shows no signs of
abating. How long it will last depends prin-
cipally on how long artificial conditions can
be maintained, and also on whether the
politicians do anything towards decentralisa-
tion. Certainly the loan boom is nearly
exhausted; there is yet the Diggers’ gratuity
distribution ahead, but after that the chances
of getting hold of cheap loans for pubi c
Works are very slender. Settling-day almost
got ahead of the war gratuity, judging by
the recent peremptory demand by the British
Government. Possibly Treasurer Watt may
lie "able to postpone the payment of the bill
a little longer ; but he cannot sidestep current
interest commitments. There are hard times
ahead—just how hard will depend on how
we get to work. At present one-half the
ponulation is striving to secure higher wages
for less work: meantime we are experiencing
a mild speculative boom which is not help-
ing a liap’orth to get the Commonwealth out
of the mire.
Looking at the future with an optimism
that conditions hardly warrant, the best that
can be said about cos. like R. and W., Ltd.,
is that it is too much to expect- profits to be
maintained—last year’s surplus was equal to
over 21 p.c. of capital. At one (ime this
co. was merely an agency concern ; nowadays
it has a large volume of advances on its
books. A comparison of the balance-sheet
figures shows the growth of th.s and other
items-: 19 q 9. 1914. • 1919.

The advances are apparently not so large
as five vears asm, for they uow

ness ( for which apparently was pa.d
in shares), and 'this asset prdbab.V includes
goodwill consideration. Hence tne labelling
of reserves as nominal in the first table.
The reserves also'include a contingency fund
of 18505,.-which has apparently been created
to protect advances; Thi s business Cer-

balance-sheet it had £34,194 of its paid capi-
tal of £69,350 (equal to 9s. lOd. per £1
share) represented by net liquid assets. In
nddition there were advances, etc., with a
book value of 15s. lOd. per share, but that
may include a certain amount of goodwill
acquired with the Crammond business.

During the past few years profits have taken
a switch-back track, due to constantly
increasing costs. Revised tariffs have again
got net results to something like their old
normal; but there is no guarantee that these
prices will maintain profits at this level.
Artificially-created conditions (for which
illogical price-fixing methods adopted by
Government-appointed Boards are partly
responsible) continue to force up the prices
of necessities, Take milk, for example. The
fluid is sold at Government-declared prices
which conditions in no way warrant. On
the N. S. Wales South Coast cow-juice is
flowing as it never has flowed before, and
the supply is far in excess of the demand
(which has been restricted to some extent
by the high prices), with the result that,
while returns to producers are artificially
maintained at a high leyel for the benefit
of the dairy-farmers in drier areas, the
South Coast hog-troughs, are awash with
milk that should be available for public
consumption at reasonable prices. The
recovery in Sargent’s latest profits is prob-
ably also due to some extent to the heavy-
luncher having being driven by increased
tariffs to content himself with lighter fare,
while the repatriated Digger and general
expansion of business have also helped the
turnover. From one c*use ard another the
co.’s figures have moved ahead in this way;

The increase in, expenses during the second
terms of the past two years was not wholly
due to -.additional costs, for at the close of
1918 a taxation reserve of £7700 suddenly
showed up in the accounts, and, though
nothing was added during the subsequent
’flu half, the total of this reserve is now
£lO,OOO. As current taxation is evidently
otherwise provided for, the disclosed net
profits for the two terms suffered to meet
the heavier calls which Sargent’s expect
from the Treasuries later on. It is a wise
management that now puts something aside
in th 5 s way; for as The Bulletin has
repeatedly shown, the Commonwealth has
to date actually pad only a few pence in
the £ of the capital cost of the war, with
the result that our future earnings will have
to bear the burden of past mismanagement
of the public purse. A co. which made some
provision to meet its share of the national
indebtedness as it was being incurred d'd
its duty while the politicians failed in
theirs. The pinch must come, sooner or later
—it looks very close now —and when the
time to' pay does arrive profit-earning may
not be so easy as it has been during recent
years, and cos. which have not accumulated
reserves for taxes are' likely to be h.t two
ways simultaneously,
Sargent’s. Ltd., which has made a big suc-
cess of a business in which many others
have failed, continues to progress rap dly.
Nearly £15,000 of fresh capital was got in
last year, and three new branches were
established ; the old Burlington Cafe, where
Hart’s, Ltd., tripped, being the principal
new venture. Going hack five and 10 years
(that is, to the second balance-sheet issued
by the co.) these .movements show up:—

Business is not so profitable as it used to be,
for though there is now £25,000 more capi-
tal and also £23892 more reserves (apart
from £lO.OOO taxation reserve) than there
was five years ago, disclosed profits are not
so vood. Nevertheless substantial progress is
still being made. After paying an uninter-
rupted 10 p.c. to shareholders, this improve-
ment is visible: —-

ment for a pm and tart business whose paid

gent’s done well for its shareholders, but it
may also be regarded as having performed
a public service by having provided a rea-
sonably cheap, fresh lunch to replace the
dry sandwich which the suburbanite used to
pack in the depths of a more or less sanitary
handbag.

x i, calls the’ x>cJ.xlu>a distinct co., nut
its operations are no longer restricted to
that picturesque little bit of the State; now-
adays it has branches as far north as Armi-
dale, at Cootamundra in the south, at Wol-
longong on the South Coast, and west at
Dubbo. In addition there are nearly 40
butter, cheese and bacon factories through-
out the State which do their marketing
through it. Partly owing to increased sup-
port from the producer and partly on account
of high prices ruling, last year’s turnover
exceeded the previous best by nearly
£200,000. Total turnover was practically
l-i million—all on a paid capital of £5448!
The table which prefaces these remarks is
not of much value; for. profits depend,
entirely on the commission charges which
the eo. makes for handling co-operators’
produce. For instance, at one time 5 p.c.
commission was charged on all butter
handled, but by 1909 the rate had been cut
to 3 p.c. Naturally, when commission
charges are reduced profits slump; in other
words, instead of having to wait for the
half-yearly slicing of surpluses the co-opera-
tor gets his whack as he goes along. But
even on the basis of 3 p.c. commission
charges, net profits have so expanded that
for the past year, after rebating one-tlrrd
of the butter commissions (reducing the
handling charges to a mild 2 p.c.), making
refunds in other departments and paying
10 p.c. on capital, the co. had £2467 of sur-
plus profit available for strengthening its
resources.
*
The directors at present require every
penny they can lay hands on to pro-

A year ago the co. acquired a well-situated
freehold, and has a building programme in
prospect. To provide funds for this and
to put the concern on a more solid basis to
grapple with financial problems that arise
from the greatly-enhanced value of consign-
ments, the directors offered some new
shares, but insufficient have been subscribed
to enable the management to go ahead with
its schemes without having to lean on out-
siders. The dairy-farmer is notorious in
this respect: when he is invited to put up
a little money to help strengthen his own
selling agencies he mostly seems to think
it is only another attempt of city sharks
to bite his ear. It has been the same in
practically all co-op. enterprises, and almost
invariably the managements have to _ waste
energy to coax in necessary cash. This sort
or tu.ng is dishearten.ng to men who make
the furtheiing of the primary producers'
interests then* life-work; and it is time the
dairy-farmer, in particular, realised that lie
cannot expect to reap without sowing. When
an old-established co. like the Berrima.
which has paid 10 p.c. dividends on co-opera-
tors’ capital for many years, issues new
shares, it is affording the producer an oppor-
tunity to put a little into an investment
which would be rushed if it were made
available for Pitt-street. The co-op. move-
ment is on the eve of big things, and the
least a co.’s constituents can do is to facili-
tate the work and enterprise of its manage-
ment. Berrima co-operators are no worse,
and probably no better, than others; but
there should not be the slightest hesitation
in subscribing without delay every penny
of the new capital the directors obviously
require. The last column of this comparison
of the growth of the co. should dispel any
doubts as to the security for the cash which
they are asked to subscribe: —

At Dec. 91 last, owing to the magnitude
of reserves, after allowing for the distri-
bution of dividends and bonuses, there were
net assets with a book value of no loss
than £5 11s. to represent each £1 of paid
capital. The table also shows that Hie co.’s
position was strengthened by £180(1 between
1909-14, and by £12,770 for the five years
since.

No jurnbuck ever put on weight as this co.
d'd last year. It had such a glorious time
that it hardly knew what to do with its
harvest. In August last the directors tried
to ease things somewhat, doubling paid
capital by issuing £BOO.OOO in bonus shares.
As visible reserves at the previous balance
amounted to only £250,000 apart from the
£35.820 balance of P. and L. carried for-
ward into the latest accounts, there remained
£50,000 of this bonus issue to be accounted
for. Evidently the whole of this amount
was provided from reserves or contingency
accounts which had hitherto been lv'dden
amongst liabilities. Prior to the capitalisa-
tion £22,500 was passed out as an interim
div. (7|- p.c. for the half-year). Though
the co. balanced only two months after the
bonus issue, a final div. of 8| p.c. was paid
on the enlarged capital. On the old capital
last year’s dividends actually gave share-
holdei's 25, p.c. But after making these
distributions visible surplus profits were
almost as large as the amounts poured into
shareholders’ pockets, the disclosed net pro-
fits for the year being not far short of half
the capital put up by proprietors. No
wonder Maoriland is experiencing a boom
and that ridiculously high prices have been
paid for grazing lands. ’
The revival of shipping activities last
year effected considerable changes in the
accounts: the latest balance-sheet total is
over half a million below that for 1918.
Here is a comparison of the grouped figures
going back 10 years:—•
1909. 1918. 1919.
Liabilities .. ... £187,328 £1,299,624 £649,732
Fixed assets .. .. 354,103 800,211 813,011
Stocks, investments and
sundry debtors .. 101,597 1,064,702 508,764
Cash and War Loan .. 18,969 50,031 88,717
At the 1918 balance there was an excess
of liabilities over more or less liquid assets
of £184.891; in the latest accounts the
margin had been reduced to £52.251. That
showed an improvement in tne liquid posi-
tion over the 12 months of £132,640, and
with the £12.800 added to the book value of
fixed assets maae the co. apparently
£145.440 better off than it was in 1918. But
since the P. and L. balance at the later date
had expanded by only £76,840, it is obvious
that the improvement was not wholly due
to the year’s operations. Most of the dis-
crepancy was evidently accounted for by the
£50.000 of invisible reserves which were
capitalised—so much profit which had not
previously been taken Credit for and until
recently had been actually displayed as a
liability. Perhaps there is something more

Hughes's proclamation further extending
the prohibition of trade with recent enemy
countries is provoking a chuckle or two in
London. Here’s the Metal World’s
comment:—
The proclamation makes strange reading when it
is considered that the British Government is urging
people on this side to trade with Germany, ana
also is engaged in selling to the Teuton Australian
copper, Australian lead, Australian wheat and flour
and Australian wool, etc... .Australia will not
always have a benevolent British Government to buy
up, with the British taxpayers’ money, its wool,
metals, wheat and produce... .and in the circum-
stances it would be as well not to be too anxious
to announce that Germany has been for ever banned
from trading with the Commonwealth.
It is all very well for Hughes to pose as
the unforgiving hero; but if our products
are reaching Germany through the British
Government, the sooner he recovers his
senses and cuts out the expensive middle-
man (who happens to be the British Govern-
ment) the better chances tve will have of
recovering from our war troubles, which are
as threatening as Germany’s.

After the market had gambled for months
on meagre information, Badak’s check-borer
W. Wilson returned to Melbourne last week
and cast a little more light on the proposi-
tion. He declares that Orton’s find is “a
new tin area and absolutely virgin ground.”
From surface indications he reckons that the
whole Jeneri Valley will prove to be tin-
bearing, though “the extent of the tin area
in.any direction is not known.” Still, the'
Badak section is “by far the richest
property” Wilson has ever seen. It appears
that the doubts as to the suitability of the
Badak ground for dredging were well
founded, for Wilson considers that “the best
method of working will lie by hydraulic
sluicing.” As to values, he considers that
Orton’s bores were put down on a plan
which would give a true idea of the value
of the ground. If all this proves correct,
then the Badak Syndicate appears to have
hit on something out of the box, for a per-
manent water supply is assured and there
seems to be no difficulty about securing
imple coolie labor locally.
Last week the syndicate was reconstructed
Into a co. with a nominal capital of £750 000
of £1 shares, 400,000 fully paids being
exchanged for the 400 £lO syndicate shares.
Working capital is to come from the issue
of 200,000 new shares on which 4s. is to be
paid for a start, leaving 150.000 unissued.
Shareholders felt so pleased with themselves
and everything that when prpsnector Orton’s
reward came up for consideration they
readily agreed to pay him £16,000- —£6000
cash to meet the 4s. application money on
the 30,000 contribs. which his present hold-
ing entitles him to apply for, and £lO,OOO
out of pi’ofits from- production. As Orton
holds 60 shares in the syndicate (the market
value last week was £108.000), on paper
be has suddenly developed cons ; derable
wealth. Still,, as some of the early birds in
the Catheart flutter learnt, it is often an-
other matter to turn apparently valuable
shares into cash. There will be a long wait
until close-boring is completed and the plant
is sluicing out news of the actual value of
the property. Meantime many of the old
Malayan brigade are still doubting
Thomases; a few of them did not hesitate
to back their opinions in the market when
shares soared a few months ago. Obviously,
on the amount of work done, a market valua-
tion of £BOO.OOO for Badak’s 50*X> acres
was merely a wild plunge. Possibly luck
may go the gamblers’ way and the Malayan
hard-heads receive the surprise of their lives.

White Hope (W.A.) has now been opened
up over a length of 530 ft. to a depth of
between 40ft. and 50ft., leaving, roughly,
about 800 ft. on the line of lode to be proved.
The mine is turning out well, but is so far
developed to give any guarantee
of a golden future. So far the average value
of the ore opened up over a length of 580 ft.
is about an ounce. In the most southerly of
the three shafts sunk, and in the crosscut
put east from it, values ai'e over the oz.,
but at the north end the average over the
full width of the lode is probably not more
than lOdwt. The mine is being well handled,
and shareholders will not be asked to wait
an unduly long time for production to com-
mence. Apart from the White Hope and
Celebration, all the mines and so-called mines
on the held are entirely speculative ventures,

natty, promise welL

After wandering in many lands and finding
nothing, Paringa Gold Mines, Ltd., has re-
turned to the West and taken an option at
Hampton Plains. There is nothing attractive
about its selection. Probably nine out of ten
blocks pegged at Hampton Plains will prove
worthless. The held has been a lucrative
one for option hunters and co. promoters.
They have had their whack out of dotations,
and don’t care a hang whether the options are
exercised or not. Leaseholders are much
concerned, however, for if the options are
thrown up they will find themselves burdened
with unsaleable wild cats and a wad of
worthless scrip.

The Hampton Plains boom has been re-
sponsible for a lot of old Westralian delu-
s.ons being re-named and introduced to the
unsuspecting as good things. A Bulletin
n an saw one in the wilderness the other day
which was reputed to “average high ove# an
enormous width” on the surface, but on
being sampled it was found to be practically
worthless. For this bonanza £20,000 in cash
and a tenth interest was asked. The same
purchase consideration was asked for an-
other show which a Melbourne co. threw on
the rubbish-heap some time ago; and there are
indications that another effort may be made
to palm it on the public. A third show which
lias been given an alias in order to throw
speculators off their guard is described by
the holder as having a reef “as wide as
itself.”

Dorrie Doolette is trying a new genera-
tion with a Ivanowna float. There are still
a few alive who swapped the scrip of Golden
Mile giants for old Kanowna shares and
then saw them fade off the market. A fair
quantity of gold was won out of the Red-
hill, but the pace was too fast and the .shoots
too short to last alongside the big mines.

oartiled 9286 tons for 14,G540z., and that
the Gentle Polly yielded Io.SGToz. from 9485

shoots are narrow, that the dyke in which

such formations is a hazard. This Redhill

crowds have come to give the field a helping
hand. One, interested in alluvial mining,
has started boring on the old abandoned
leads. Another is busy putting the derelict
Kanowna Consols in order. Kanowna has
been dead for many years, and half of its
habitations have been carted elsewhere.

Without the Constellation the Amalgamated
would be having a rough passage. Two
other shafts are producing larger tonnages
than ConsteUation, but the 1871 tons from
*TL_ Carllsle averaged only 12s. and Unitv’s
1(57 tons were worth only 14s. Still, with
the gold premiums, Amalgamated is not
doing at all badly at present. With over
15 shafts kept going the management is not
sparing effort in its pursuit of fresh shoots,
put, apart from the Constellation, its luck
is out so far.
Duke Extended, Maryborough (Vic.) ,has had
a close call through almost everyone becoming
dog-tired of paying calls. Most of the work
for the past year has been chasing a lost
lead under the basalt of the Bet Bet plains.
To the west plenty of boulders and cement
could be got, but not a color. To the east
the intermediate level disclosed slates as
hard as a food-profiteer’s heart. In brown
wash some white streaks gave gold, but the
whole prospect was a dud. Then soft slate
showed up, and the Board-room optimist now
has visions of bores in the distant road-
way foretelling that Eldorado is ahead. The
gold in the adjoining Main Leads mine came
in at the junction of the Duke and Main
leads, a long way off; so if the Extended
gets good gold ahead of its present work.ng
race to the boundary it will be very sur-
prising.

Thermo-Electric, the English concern
which commenced operations with a lavish
expenditure of capital at Wolfram Camp
(Q.), has for some time confined mining
operations almost to the limit of merely
complying with labor conditions. Good
bodies of ore are known to in many
of the mines owned by the co., but nothing
is being done to prove or develop them. Its
Mt. Carbine property is a first-class pro-
position, but it was unfortunate and did
not benefit from the cash which was spent
at Wolfram Camp. Some time ago these
properties were put on the market in con-
junction with Burma mines under the title
of the Burma and North Queensland Rare
Metals Co., with a capital of £600,000. Since
then there has been a silence, except that
Bewick-Moreing’s representative sampled
and reported on the properties for somebodv.
His report has not been made public. The
whole of the rare metal mines in N. Queens-
land are rushing up their stone to get as
much as possible mined before March 81.
when the British purchase agreement will
probably terminate.

Having got £90,000 from the Queensland
Government to work its colliery at Mt. Mul-
ligan, Chillagoe Co. is beginning to bestir
itself. Preparations are under way to con-
struct a dam, and the foundations of the
coke works have been put in. Of the
£90,000 lent to the co. only £5OOO is ear-
marked for development work, and £25.000
is being used to liquidate a pressing account.
In consideration for the loan the Govern-
ment is to get coke at almost cost price,
but it will be some time before any is pro-
duced. At present 98 p.c. of the coal pro-
duced is used in Government enterprises, and
coke supplies for the State smelters at
Chillagoe have to be dragged from N. S.
Wales. The Mulligan coke proposition is all
right until the Bowen field gets going, when
the small seam will probably take second
place.

Queensland Labor Ministry has discovered,
as those in other States did, that its sup-
porters do not make affable employees. At
the Einasleigh, which is mined by the State
in conjunction with the Chillagoe smelters,
relations with the extremists reached a crisis,
and the show has shut down ; whereupon the
local branch of the A.W.U. has declared the
mine “black.” Since Einasleigh is the prin-
cipal producer, furnace operations at the
State smelters will be curtailed.

The successful re-opening of Bischoff’s
once-famous Brown face, after having been
abandoned for many years, has caused a
flutter. A rise off the stope drift in this
face cut a band of good ore, Bft. of which
assayed over 4 p.c. tin, with 40ft. of mixed
pyrites and porphyry ore averaging 1 p.c.,
which is good grade in comparison with the
mine-run averag-e of >35 p.c. Reopening of
the various lodes is in hand, with promising
indications of a reasonable tonnage of good
grade ore being obtained. The Slaughter-
yard, North-East and Thompson lodes are
looking very well at present. The Queen
lode with depth has become poor and patchy.
Bischoff is nowadays giving some attention
to the treatment of the pyritic ore which
was rejected in the past.
* * * »
Mt. Bischoff Extended has been having a
rough spin of late, due to water, firewood
and labor shortage, a combination that has
not facilitated profitable ore extraction on
this low-grade, narrow lode. Development
work in the No. 7 level has exposed only
poor stuff, indicating a considerable
impoverishment with depth. Despite man-
ager Schells’s selective mining the tin
recovery shows a falling of to about £ p.c.,
an average which a high market
to make operations payable. Extended may
make arrangement with the old Bisehoff for
cheap elecnieal power, and by purchasing
the block of Giblin ore in the oid Wheal-
BisChoff ground the show may have a fight-
ing chance for a year or so*.

“Tip”: Brown earns his crust as a sar’n’-
majofi in the permanent forces. Judge his
surprise when he was informed by his O.C.
that he was to put through their recruits
course of mtisketry two me# who had just

joined up and who had served in the A.I.F.
as infantrymen right through the late war.
Though they had fired at Fritz more cart-
ridges than Brown gets halfpence in two
years’ pay, Red Tape considers that they
are not to be trusted to handle a rifle until
they have been “over the top” on the local
rifle range, and wasted a pound or two’s
worth of time and ammunition.
* * * *
“Rio”: By the Osterley there arrived in
Sydney two of the most brilliant of our
younger permanent officers. One, besides
being decorated, was mentioned in
despatches five times before he was 25. He
was through everything from Gallipoli to
the Armistice, and but for his age and the
fact that he was a permanent officer would
probably have been a general. He finished
the war in the very nerve-centre of the
British army, the Operations section of
Douglas Haig’s staff, and was then sent
to the Staff College, where he was easily
the youngest student. The other is a young
colonel of the R.A.G.A., who has the
C.M.G. and D. 5.0., besides foreign orders
and a wonderful service record. He also
was selected for the Staff College, and both
are known to have done brilliant work
there. Well, in the daily paper I take
there wasn’t a line about either of these
distinguished fighting officers; but a citizen
Lieut.-C<»lonel who arrived by the same
boat, and who had an armchair billet in
Australia House all through the war, had
his photo and half-n-column of letterpress.
There is nothing unusual about this; but
will anybody contend that the permanent
officer gets a fair deal?
* * * •
“Hamer”: The news that a leg-bone with
a ring of iron and chain attached had been
unearthed brought crowds to an excavation
for a new building in Pitt-street. The throng
that tramps from the Sydney Railway Sta-
tion paused to contemplate the spot, and
persons who usually take the tram took a
walk instead in order to share the thrill.
They saw nothing but soil in a state of
earthquake, but they guessed at the place
where the convict’s remains had been found,
and mentally marked the spot with an X
whilst they wondered whether old Botany
Bay had been murdered or legally done to
death or, bolting for liberty, had got lost
in the bush. Then the Government Medical
Officer examined the bone with chain
attached and pronounced it to be a part of
the le<” of a hobbled cow: and a number of
citizens who wasted good time looking at a
spot where some long-ago Strawberry died
bave ceased to take any interest in convict
remains.

“Bisco”: The most picturesque feature of
Norfolk Island is disappearing with the
Melanesian Mission. In the centre of the
island the mission had a school for natives
collected from pretty well every dot in
the Pacific. They were housed in a large
compouud, each bunch with a common lan-
guage having its huts in a group. The
result was a sort of World’s Fair.
The first thing the students learnt
was Motu, a combination-language easily
absorbed by the natives, who then
could understand each other. A trade-
school and very fine farm, as well as
the inevitable chapel, were included in the
show. The chapel is a beautiful shrine, and
would grace a city. It was built as a
memorial to the first bishop, who was
speared by black Bolshevists many years ago.
Its p.pe-organ, played by a woolly brother,
resulted from the sale of a book winch de-
lighted our grandmothers—“ The Daisy
Chain,” by Charlotte Young.

“0.L.”: Bumble, landing with both feet
into Melbourne’s preparations for receiving
the I’fxnce of Smiles,
has made a character-
istic proposition. St;
Kilda-road, now one
of the most beautiful
avenues in the world
when the trees are in
leaf, is to be disfigured
bn the day of Master
Edwards’s arrival by
a row of “municipal
stands,” planted , at
various intervals along
its course. In the
autumn Art and Nature
meet very affably on
St. Kilda-road. and
there is . something
brutally fantastic in
the idea of having the
unnatural and pnin-
fully-inartistic figure
of an absurdly-hatted
mayor, clad in furs and dog-collar, jack-in-
the-boxing at every other cross-street along
the principal approach to the city.

“Broker”: A few months ago Australian
wine-growers were offered a tempting
Canadian contract for port-wine required
by a finm of druggists in Montreal, “for
medicinal use,” and valued at £4O 000. They
were unable to guarantee supplies, and the
document was not signed. Tenders for lesser
quantities have since been invited from the
same quarter, coupled with this.proviso: “In
the event of your being able to fill orders,
we request that your firm supply glass-
stoppered bottles in preference to all others,
on account of the increasing local shortage
of corkscrews, resulting from prohib : tion.”

“Dido” interviews the dustman :

The gilded wooden mace, subject of deri-
sive remarks at the opening of the Federal
session, is a venerable bauble. It was used
in the Vic. Leg. Assembly from 1857 till the
end of the 1804-5 sessmu, and was then given
a .spell till October, 1891; when it was
brought into the light again. The silver-gilt
mace, repl'ca of that in the British House
of Commons, which flaunted its charms for
25, years, walked or was quietly luted by
somebody between the time the Assembly
rose, at 12.40 a.m. on Friday, October 9,
1891, and, the srime afternoon at 2 o’clock.
Police and select committee inquiries failed
to get near the thief. When lending Parlia-
ment House the Vic. Legislature also lent
the bit of gold-leafed carving, and an excuse

“Do any of the people you save ever show
their gratitude in a practical manner?”
“Oh, yes; some of them never come near the

was thus furnished for the Assembly to get
a new mace. Speaker Mason persuaded Pea-
cock, Premier and Treasurer (1901), to foot
the bill (£MOO or so) for a new silver-gilt
ornament, which is still placed on rests at
the end of the table when the First Com-
moner is in the chair and under the table
when the Chairman of Committees is ruling
tho roost.
Sam Barnes, Vic. Minister for Railways,
is giving up trying to escan« from the
growls about truck-snortage. WLile he was
driving over the route ox tne suggesced rail-
way from Yarra Glen to Yea on a hot day
last month he saw the word “Bar” in large
letters on a ways'de window, and the car
stopped immediately. Striding in with his
four friends he oidered some beer. “Don’t
think I’ve got much,” said the pub-keeper
to the unknown visitors. “Why?” queried
Barnes. “Expecting to be closed up?”
“Not that,” answered Bung; “but there are
no blanky trucks as usual.”

While canvassing for the Vic. Leg.
Assembly rolls, a Melbourne John Hop col-
lected a schedule prepared by the daughter
of Ah Chink. She did the job thoroughly.
Her dad, sue mentioned, had three wives
and 40 children. Ah Dad was alarmed
when his State-school trained missie told
him what she had done, and hastened to the
police station to explain that “only one wife
Australian —all-a rest China lady.”

“Smike”: The Anzac tweed industry in
Melbourne is beginning to grow, despite the
hostility of Fllnders-lane. The factory is
now under stronger control, and solid boost-
ing by Dr. Mhloney and others has caused
an increase of business that can only be
comfortably handled in larger quarters. The
comparative cheapness of the Anzac tweed,
with its guarantee of a longer life than the
machine-made material, has given it a repu-
tat.on that no sneer about lack of fini&h,
or style, or pattern can damage in the eyes
of the average man. One of its greatest
beauties is that it cannot be profiteered.
Anyone can pick a suit-length at the fac-
tory, but he cannot take it away. The
purchase will only be handed to the cus-
tomer’s authorised tailor under conditions
that prevent the latter acquiring the cloth
for trade. Of course, the amount you save
on present prices depends on the expen-
siveness of the tailor you employ.

“S.E.N.” : I was in hospital at Tidworth
where most of the patients were Tommies,
but there was one other Aussie to help me
keep the world cheerful. We used to call
one of the staff sisters Soda Sal, and any-
body who has had to swallow that soul-
searching concoction will understand exactly
what she was like. One day a Tommy padre
Avhom all of us execrated, a typical _ wowser,
was having a heart-to-heart talk with Soda
Sal in the ward, when my compatriot entered.
Without a ghost of a smile he stopped
and lifted up h ; s vo’ce in song. “Do not
trust him, gentle maiden, I have gathered
ferns myself.” he warbled, till his hideous
gas-cough racked him. Soda Sal never for-
gave him, and we never saw the nadre again.
Neither worried the Aussie much.

“Spare Corporal”: The arrival of a fed-up
Fritz who wanted to sell his share in the
war was one of the humors of a spell in the
line on the Messines sector. He arrived in
the grey of an early morning, laden like a
camel, for besides his rations and blankets
he carried many extras evidently intended
to propitiate his captors; and just because
he was so earnest about being made prisoner
it was unanimously resolved not to take
charge of him. He was directed from post to
post till he reached supports in the ravine,
where he wandered up and down trying to
find someone willing to make him captive, still
humping his wearisome load and looking
supremely piteous. Finally he met a Tommy
officer, and the joke that the Diggers enjoyed
was spoiled.
* * # #
“Gormey”: During Birdy’s visit to the
Tasmanian West Coast, a grand proces-
sion of returned Diggers was arranged at
Lyell, and the Gormanston Brass Band,
fresh from the field of victory at Zeehan,
where it had annexed honors in a band
competition, came “over the hill” from the
mine end to join in the proceedings. At
the starting point ready for the march
stood the triumphant band. The marshal
rode forth to his duty. But something, it
EXPLANATORY.

night, on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs-
day, and here I am again to-night—
don't you smell a rat?”
is not clear what, d’sturbed the mar-
shal’s steed, and it made a cavalry charge
on the warriors drawn up and awaiting its
coming. The front men wavered, side-
stepped and escaped the full force of the
charge. The rear rank was not so for-
tunate. The cornet player was toppled
over, and the beater of the big drum knocked
out. The rider was thrown from his
elevated perch and the horse fell, sadlj
mixed up with the drum and the trombone,
which, together with the cornet were
torn asunder to sound no more. Then the band
reformed and inspected itself, and decided
that it was too mutilated to take any fui-
ther part in the proceedings.
SELF-ABNEGATION.
THE PLAIN CHILD: “My dolly simply wouldn't wear such extravagant frocks. She
helped to win the war.”
“G. Elburg”: Perth has been enduring
meatless days owing to a strike of butchers’
employees, and the citizen has been abroad
with a pinched waistline and a hungry look
in his eye. After a few days the employers
co-operated in killing, and opened a number
of shops (or retail trade over the counter.
The first few days’ business would have sad-
dened the soul of a vegetarian. Housewives
charged in force, but without order. The
nolice had to take charge and filter the car-
nivorous dames through the door in small
batches, or the butcher would have been
trampled underfoot and his chops and joints
torn from him. Not even his kidneys would
have escaped.
+ « * -W
“Dido”: The other afternoon a white duck
escaped from a dealer’s cart in Collins-street
east, a most unfortunate place for one of
the tribe to get loose, as
this part of Melbourne
is infested with doctors
of all sorts. I waited to
follow the fortunes of
the stray. It perched on
the doorstep of a well-
known practitioner and
after preening itself for
a few moments, opened
up, and began to make
remarks. In an incred-
ibly short space of time
a startled nurse appeared,
and shooed the bird off
the mat. It waddled a
little further east, nans-d
for reflection under the
window of a doctor of
dentistry and said
“Quack, quack !” just I ke
that, and only twice be-
fore the dentist was out,
wearing a white . expres-
sion and dusting the dock
off with a towel. Next
it fluttered into the hall
of an eminent physician,
and addressing a lady
about to enter said
f ‘Quack, quack !” Then it flew
into the street. That luckless
bird had created quite a commo-
tion in Collins-street east before
a small boy with a tooth for
roast duck captured it, and bore
it |pff. The speed with which
doctors, physicians, dentists
and surgeons, or their emis-
saries sped out to chase the
slanderer out of their vicinity spoke volumes
for the tender conscience possessed by
gentlemen of the healing professions.
• * * •
“Forward, Please”: It’s no good telling
your friend who isn’t in the rag business that
he needn’t worry—that things will be
cheaper presently. They won’t be. We
haven’t anything like reached top. Buyers
are naying more in England for stuff than
the houses are charging in Australia. Hor-
roekses’s No. 1 calico, which is the best
gauge for all cottons, used to be, say,
fivepence. It is past two shillings, and is
going to be three. Multiply the old prices
of cotton goods (including flannelettes) by
five, and you are somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of either the current or the pending
figure. Even then English manufacturers
don't want the business. So many hundreds
of millions of new “wealth” was created
during the war and money of a sort is so
plentiful that the makers can find a market
at home for all they can make. It is the
same with America (we’ve been drawing our
silks largely from theTe), and nobody knows
what is happening In Japan. Brices of
women’s clothes in American retail stores are
roughly 60 p.c. over ours. Mrs. Brittain,
the wife of the late American Consul in
Sydney, waited till she got to ’Frisco to
buy a frock. She paid 300 dollars for what
would have been dear at £35 (say 175 dol-
lars) in Australia.
“Copabella”: A Yic. provincial municipal
councn noted for the composite godliness
of its members —hardly a man but is " local
preacher or church pillar—was leading a
party of visitors through the city’s big meat
works. Slaughtermen have the reputation
of being hard cases, and the visiting party
was astonished when it . entered the
slaughtering room to hear the 50 or 60
blood-spattered greasies burst into a hymn,
with the “parts” correctly taken. Greatly
impressed, the City Fathers halted and
stood uncovered. On emerging from the
atmosphere of blood, hair and oratorio, a
serious councillor congratulated the works
manager on the musical number and the
excellent “tone” in the works which must
have inspired it. “Oh, yes,” su’d the boss,
“the lads always sing that when any of
the heads come through. That’s the Red
Flag song, ‘Solidarity for Ever.’ ”
* * * *
An Adelaide Court is looking into the
nearest approach to a “society” scand -l
which Adelaide has had for a generation. It
is of a harmless enough character and
resembles the plot of an American film-play.
Harold Smith, of the wealthy Law Smith
family, married a “working” girl from an
establishment close to their big Harris-
Scarfe stores. Although over 40. he did not
care to let his parents know what he had
done, and the newly-married pair signed an
agreement—formal, but not drawn by a law-
yer—that they would not live together. Now
his parents are dead, and the wife claims resti-
tution of her conjugal rights. The Adelaide
dailies reported the opening proceed’ngs as
briefly as possible, except the Labor Herald,
which gave a great wealth of detail of the
early stages of the romance, and was re-
warded by the biggest boom of its career.
Ordinarily the demand for the Herald is
not remarkable; but the price of that day’s
issue soared from a penny to a shilling.
“Dolphin’s” story of a speeklet:—
Macquarie Island, the most southern bit of the
Commonwealth (55°5.), was brought to light
in 1810 by Frederick Hasselberg (the name is
spelt in six other ways), master Of the schooner
Perseverance, a Sydney-built vessel owned by Camp-
bell and Co. Hasselberg was sailing out of Sydney on
a sealing voyage, and on the same voyage discovered
Campbell Island, where he was drowned on his next
trip. Sealskins were worth a guinea apiece in Lon-
don then, and seals were so thick at the Macquaries
that even at that not very exalted price there was
big money in the business. Within three months
six vessels had cleared from Sydney for the good
hunting. On her second trip there the Perseverance
brought up no less than 35,000 sealskins, and even
that wasn’t a record, for in 1806 the Favorite
fetched 60,000 in one cargo. For some years the
Sydney, sealers had it all their own way, and then
the Hobart Town vessels began to take a hand.
When Bellingshausen called there in 1820 he reckoned
that the i'ur-s'cals were about extinct, but saw any
quantity of sea-clcphants, which the sealers, of
whom there were 40 on the island, used to boil
down for their oil. By 1830 there weren’t even
enough sca-elephants to be worth murdering, and
except for a few shipwrecked crews no one bothered
the island for half a century or more. For a good
many years now Joe Hatch has been leasing the
island from the Tasmanian Government, and his
gangs have b< e.i boiling down penguins as well as
sea-elephants for their oil. What will happen to the
place next the Lord only knows. The British Zoo-
logical Society and all sorts of scientific bodies,
natural history-lovers and explorers have been urging
♦hat it should be made a reserve for the sub-Antarctic
fauna, the birds and sea-beasts which resort to it to
breed from millions of square miles of sea. When
Glynn was still Minister for Home and Territories
he was carrying on some leisurely negotiations about
taking the island over from the Speck and doing
something of Hie kind with it; but now Poynton
will have a chance to start all over again.
Rabbit-trapping courses will be given at
the Universities and correspondence schools
soon. Meanwhile there’s this advt. from
Footscray in the Age to go on with: —
Why make rabbjt-trapping a failure? I can teach
you all you want to know in three days. Get experi-
ence before you lose your traps and money, and be
with the successful trappers.

“Magpie” : Many Diggers who wanted to
do a bit of lead-swingin’ used to swallow a
little cordite, which in most cases caused the
quack to send them to hospital suffering
from heart-palpitation. Ginger Mick came
a thud, though. He told me about it this
way. “ ‘Well, well,’ the old bloke sez, ‘wot
is your trouble, lad :’ I grabs me tummy ’ard
an’ sez I’m ill. ‘You are,’ sez ’e; ‘yeh got
corditis bad. Yeh need a pill. Before yeh
go to sleep to-night.’ ’e sez, ‘swallow the
bullet, son, an’ you’ll be right.’ ”

“Toby C.”: Recently a mounted stranger
pulled up at Tobermory station, which is
160 miles from Lake Nash (N.T.), the
nearest police dcpOt. The visitor was in-
vited to tucker, and during the banquet he
inquired if anybody kept a dog about the
premises. They usually do keep a dog of
some kind on these far-out runs, as the boss
explained. It then turned out that the
stranger was a Federal John Hop on a dog-
tax collecting mission. The trip to and from
Tobermory entailed a journey of 320 miles
with an away-from-home allowance of 3s.
per day—to register a mong. and collect

told me — er —I would be very popular
with the opposite sex.”
SWEETER: “Oh, and you still believe in
phrenology ?”
“Blanc”: As the 4th Brigade, A.1.F., went
into the line of outposts near Gapaard, below
Messines Ridge, some “tony” Tommies were
in comfortable billets at Merris. A fortnight
later when we pulled out they were still rest-
ing, and, naturally, looking in the pink. The
Diggers were a tired, muddy, unshaven lot,
for the fortnight had been a hard one not
only on account of terrific strftfing but be-
cause of constant rain. A “loot” came out
from his mess just as we were passing. He
gazed in astonishment at the straggling,
droop’ng column ; then putting his head in
through the mess window he called: “I say,
skippah! Gome and have a peep at these
chaps. They must have had an ahf’lly
rotten time.” Out strolled the skippah. His
monocle rested on us for a few seconds. Then
he called: “I say, you fellows, what are
you 1”, Soldiers!” bawled one of our roughest.
CUPID’S ARROW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fair young lover takes his sweet, and walks
beneath the moon.
In blue, translucent atmosphere all nature Is
a swoon.
He does not talk to her of doves, or roses burning
red,
But pulls his automatic out, and shoots her through
the head.
Down by the sea the dark-browned man decoys his
dimpled joy.
She answers him in dulcet tones, and tremulous
and coy
She floats into his arms, and then she takes a
careful shot,
And with a parting word of love she kills him on
the spot.
Ah, love, this love, the sweetest thing that sways
our human hearts,
Is making all the gunsmiths rich! llow timidly
she starts,
This maiden fair with swan-like grace, who to
my breast has slid!
I wonder as I kiss her lips where her revolver’s
hid.
The common man with vulgar ways of dull com-
mercial life
Is raised to, grandeur seeing her who is to be his
wife.
All cheaper impulse flees his soul: with splendid
thoughts aglow
He shoots at seven yards and lays her permanently
low.

Sir Arthur Brown, now in Sydney,
navigator of the first ’plane to fly the
Atlantic, is well under 30 and looks well
over 40. He had a particularly rough spin
in the war. Enlisting in the infantry in
1914 he served in France as a foot-slogger
for a year. Then he joined the R.F.G. He
did observing work for the most part. On
the Western front the machine- lie was in
was shot down. The pilot was killed;
Brown’s foot was shattered by a dum-dum
bullet; and in the subsequent crash his leg
was broken in five places. He was a!
prisoner for 24 years in one of the worst
of the Boche camps, and the hunted look
in his eyes and his prematurely-whitened
hair testify to the sort of time he had. He
is an engineer by profession, and built a
dying-machine for himself in London two
years before the war.
In the new- House of Reps, there are a
dozen Bills, seven Jims, six .'Jacks, five
Georges and three Franks and Toms. Page,
M.H.R. for Cowper, is Earle Christmas
Grafton, and the new member for Adelaide
is Reginald Pole Blundell. Lucien Law-
rence Cunningham is now the hope of
Gwydir, and Bruce Smith’s successor is
Charles William Chilian Marr. Lazzarini.
whom you would expect to be Giuseppe or
Giacomo, is Hubert Peter; whilst the Wes-
leyan Gabb, who outed Glynn, is unaccount-
ably Joel Moses. Stanley Bruce’s parents’
second choice was Melbourne, and Arthur
Rodgers grows more tractable when you call
him Stanislaus. Incidentally Dicky Foster’s
parents were unduly optimistic when they
dubbed him Witty. The name almost
amounts to defamation of character.
Birdwood and Monash are to be made
honorary LL.D.’s of Melbourne University.
It’s the sort of thing that makes men who
study for the degree so pleased. Doctors of
Medicine, being numerous, take good care
that nobody is ever made an honorary M.D.
for, say, extraordinary* excellence as a car-
penter.
Premier Lawson (Vic.) has joined the
queue of guinea-pigs. He is a director now
of the Perpetual Trustees and the Colonial
Mutual Insurance.
Brig.-General “Pompey” Elliott, Senator,
city solicitor and several other things, has
been made a member of the committee of
management of Melbourne Hospital. If he
adds many more jobs to his list he will have
to cut out his prayers.
“0.K.”: Th# late Sainsbury, ex-Commis-
sioner of Vic. Police, lives in my recollection
as the author of a wise epigram apropos
the suppression of John Wren’s tote.
We were talking about the sham-
democratic argument that the Law was
unfair when it discriminated between
the gambling-hell facilities of the rich and
of the poor, and I snorted at the claim that
the one class should be left at liberty to
fool away its hard-earned wages at the tote-
shop so long as the other wtts permitted to
lose its unearned increment at the club.
“Yes,” said Sainsbury, “the poor fool damns
his wife and family, but the rich fool only
damns hinlself.”
From an ex-major of the A.A.M.G.: —
The Bulletin, referring lately to the great work
done among the Diggers in the prevention and
treatment of V.D., mentions General Howse. I
don’t want to disparage the General; but I will
say that those who were responsible for the work,
and especially for securing improvements at Bulford,
did it in the teeth of steady opposition from Howse’s
office. The names of three men ought, in this con-
nection, to be kept in grateful remembrance by Aus-
tralia, and the mothers of Australia in particular.
Lieut.-Col. Grigor, of Sydney, and Arthur Morris,
of Melbourne, bore the brunt of the early work and
had to fight a dogged, up-hill fight for every
penn’orth of equipment. Later Lieut.-Col. Norman
M. Gibson, of Sydney, succeeded Grigor at Bulford,
and did the A.I.F. a service which I am sure none
of his colleagues would care to see credited to others.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Kerby, whom Ballarat has returned to the Reps,
by a challenged majority of one vote, is not likely
to take the prize for popularity. He is an aggres-
sive, square-jawed citizen with stark language, and
he has such an immense opinion of Hughes that he
cannot brook criticism of his idol without figuratively
roaring for the tradueer’s blood. Wherefore his
maiden speech the other night distributed punishment
in equal proportions to Labor and Cocky, who, he

N.S. WALES: “May what we are about to receive be good enough to make us truly
thankful!"
alleged, were trying to trip up the Superman arid
become a nuisance on the path of progress. The
peace that had settled on the assemblage during the
previous discourse of Dr. Maloney was shattered by
angry interjections; and the deepening pink on
various craniums showed the extent of the internal
heat. But Kerby didn’t go far enough to need
an ambulance. He restored good humor by talking
proudly of the "laurels” the Government had won
at the elections. In the joy that followed someone
was heard remarking that he had mixed his vege-
tables. Surely the hon. member had meant tomatoes.
It is related of Gabb, the member who now
represents the S.A. constituency that was so
long in the care of the scholarly Glynn,
that once during the campaign he was
assailed with onions and similar horti-
cultural specimens. The chairman arose in
heated expostulation. The candidate begged
him to be seated. “They may have bought
the vegetables in my shop,” he said ap-
pealingly.
Flying is becoming a habit with Gov-
ernors. Ellison-Macartney, of Westralia, was
the first to go aloft; then Galway took a
last look at Adelaide from beyond the
clouds. Now Newdegate has been taken up
by Norman Brearley at Albany, and he is
the most enthusiastic of the lot.
McPherson, Vie. Treasurer, gave without
wincing a year’s Ministerial salary to the
building fund of the new Scotch College.
Atkinson, member for Wilmot (Tas.), who
was Acting-Chairman of Committees last
week when Henry Hayseed made a flank
attack on Hughes and lost, and who ruled
against long speeches, was a student at Trim
Col. (within Melb. Uni.) when the revolt
against Warden Leeper occurred 31 years
ago. Most of the youths who took a promi-
nent or passive part in that revolt, and whose
names were frequently mentioned during the
long subsequent inquiry, rose afterwards to
high places in the professions, and a few
were heard of iii the late war. As every-
body knows, Leeper continued as Warden for
quarter of a century more.
Harry Wiggins, who went west lately at
Dunalley (Tas.) after 83 years of battling,
belonged to one of the first families of the
Speck. His grandfather was a sergeant in
the force which came with Lieut.-Gov.
Collins to Port Phillip and then, in 1804,
crossed to the Derwent. According to the
family tradition a daughter of the original
Wiggins, afterwards Mrs. Vimpany, was the
first white child born in Tasmania.
Jabez Wright and five other candidates
for the N.S.W. Assembly describe themselves
as politicians. Of about a hundred callings
represented, the land, with 85 farmers and
12 graziers, is best represented; there are
24 agents, 21 clerks and accountants, and
17 organisers and secretaries. Mrs. Toohey,
Socialist candidate for Botany, owns to
“domestic duties”; her ' colleague, Miss
Loughran, is a dressmaker.
J. A. Cassidy, who died at Christchurch
(M.L.) recently, was one of the most enthu-
siastic book-collectors in the Shaky Isles.
He was born in Hokitika in the roaring days
of the West Coast.. Dad profitably ran
coaches and had his son educated at St.
Francis Xavier’s, Melbourne. On his return
to M.L. young Cassidy was articled to T.
W. (now Justice) Stringer, and for 30 sub-
sequent years pursued Costs". He was 53
when the court adjourned.
Frederick Chappie, just gone to Europe
for a change, is one of the most remarkable
of Adelaide’s youthful veterans. That he
should keep on working hard after giving
up the, headmastership of. Prince Alfred
College with a record of 40 years’ service is
not so strange; E. M. Smith, recently Sur-
veyor-General, simply took an office and
started on his own account after having to
resign the Government billet on the ground
of statutory old-age. Chappie is head of
the Y.M.C.A. and other aggressively-good
institutions. The remarkable point in his
activity is that he still plays tennis regu-
larly at 74 —and plays a very fair game.
Because the Vic. Government would offer
her nothing better than £240 a year, Mar-
garet Cuthbertson, senior inspectress of fac-
tories, who fought the sweater with great
courage before the community had worked
up a conscience on the subject, has resigned
She has given about 30 years to the work
and is now going to private employment at
a salary nearly double what the State was
prepared to give.
H. W. Bernard, carrying the quaint
banner of a "straight-out independent” for
Hyde (N.S.W.), claims a vote on the ground
that he has reared a family of 11.
“J.8.H.”: Commander Charles Jeffries,
who has just been appointed Generalissimo
of Salv'army Forces in Scotland, served his
apprenticeship in Australia and afterwards
in China. In the early years of the move-
ment London roughs and larrikins organ-
ised themselves into a “Skeleton Army,”
harassed the Salvationists, and smashed up
their meetings. Jeffries joined this rowdy
mob, but one night old General Booth got
hold of him, fitted him with the red jersey,
and he has been preaching blood and fire
ever since. In Sydney he humped the traffic
regulations, and was imprisoned while on
his honeymoon, but was released through
the intervention of Governor Carrington.
Marion Edwards, the discovery of whose
sex made, a sensation a few years ago, is a
familiar figure in Melbourne these days. By
virtue of a special dispensation Billarioii
wears the pants of her adopted sex, and she
has sufficient appreciation of good tailoring
to always present a neat appearance. She
looks a trifle boyish, though, mainly because
there is none of the blue of shaving: about
her chin. She has a wholehearted contempt
for the conventional frippery of the female
and says she wouldn’t return to it for all
the voile blouses in the world. Bill is a
great racegoer, and asserts her masculinity
even to the extent of refusing the concession
of half-rates to ladies for admission to the
courses. She insists that clothes make the
man.
Sydney Harbor front lost one of its best-
known figures when Captain James R. Fer-
rier died. He served his apprenticeship on
the barque Woollahra, got his “ticket,"
toiled for the old A.S.N. Co. for several
years, and finally anchored in the service of
Sydney Harbor Trust, becoming Assistant-
Harbor-master. He was 61 when the Boats-
wain piped.
Dead .in Adelaide, close on 78, Benjamin
Fisher, a mercantile man who came from
London at 40, got experience for some years
with the legal firm of Pope, and then joined
Gabriel Bennett as stock and station agent.
His sensitive, eye-glassed face always looked
more like the organist and painter he was
in his leisure moments than the man-on-the-
land; but big business abilities helped to
build the firm of Bennett and Fisher into
the leading affair that it is.
The finely-endowed Cawthron Institute,
which threatens to do invaluable research
work for Maori land, is losing no time. Pro-
fessor Easterfield, the director, has already
the nucleus of his staff. The Institute’s
chemist, Rigg, has started on a soil-shrvey
of the Nelson province; Dr. Tillyard, of
Hornsby, Sydney, a front-rank Austra-
lian authority on insect nests and their
natural enemies, has been appointed biolo-
gist ; and Kathleen M. Curtis, a Maariland
graduate who established a solid reputation
in Britain for investigations on potato dis-
eases for the Board of Agriculture, has been
secured as mycologist.
Commodore Dumaresq’s visit to the old
Treasury in Melbourne in see Lieut.-Gov.
Irvine recalled a yarn regarding a namesake
who was once a State Treasury clerk. When
on a country investigation, he lodged a
wire for the departmental accountant. The
signature was too much for the telegraph
officials, and it came through this way—“A.
Dumar, Esq.’*
Cabena has dimmed his small chances of
ever being Mayor of Melbourne again. He
told a crowd of loyalty-leaguers the other
day that just after he was defeateu a tele-
gram came addressed to the Mayor. As
lie was still Mayor for a month lie opened
it and found it contained congratulations
from one P. Bourke. Knowing that nobody
of the name of Bourke would shower com-
pliments on him, he said, he realised that
the message was not for him. A man who
opens a letter intended for another man and
then talks about its contents may shine in
many spheres, but isn’t cut out for a Chief
Citizen.
Joseph Timms, Syd Kidman’s partner, has
taken over the Wilgena run, the farthest-
out holding on the eastern section of th<‘
East-West line, and is stocking it with cattle.
It is a nice little place of 3000 square miles,
and years ago they shore 70,000 sheep on it.
But the dingoes have got in and made it
no place for sheep, and for a good while it
has carried little stock of any kind. Big
slices of the Nullarbor Plain, farther out.
have been taken up but not stocked so far:
the great need is water. Years before a rail-
way was thought of the Murrays of Fowler's
Bay put stock on the eastern edge of the
plain; but they had to give it up.
THE EGOTIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The world was a burden yesterday,
Its blues were leaden, its greens were grey,
Its laughter a crackle of burning weeds
And a cumbrous posing its shift for deeds;
It had never a song, and the last white star
Was the shine of a lamp on a bubble of tar.
If a Titan had come with a wedge of stone
And split the world from the temperate zone
Right down to the tropic of Timbuctoo
The future couldn’t have looked more blue,
Nor the present have had a more cheerless smell
If the Devil had opened the hatches of Hell.
This morning the sun came over the hill
With a handful of palest gold to spill,
And the sky was a grey that is more than blue,
Like the look of a girl with a kiss to do
Before she shall open her morning dower
And her heart be a wven-song breaking in flower.
I heard the laughter of world and star,
And I knew how great the great things are.
It was easy to love, it was hard to hate,
But I hated well, though I hated late;
And I saw the rose at the archway nod,
White and sweet with the scent of God.
What should I heed of yesterday
With my dreams at work and my thoughts at play?
Egotist, set at the heart of things,
On the point of your nose the great world swings ;
And it sinks in a swamp when a microbe pens a
.Sneezeful stanza of influenza!

Lieut.-Governor Lennon (Q.) was a candi-
date for the Agent-General’s job, secured by
Hunter. But the billet was cut-and-dried,
and Lennon, it is said, got only one vote
in Caucus.
Out in a Western N. S. Wales township
a child who had only just begun life, and
had not done anything to deserve punish-
ment, has had the name of Keith Ross
Smith Vickers Vimy Bennett heaped upon
him.
So far as the. records show, Australia’s
first mint was established in Perth in 1832.
An ingenious individual named Woods
started making coins from silver spoons, tea-
pots and other such utensils. He carried on
for six months, and was then transported to
Van Diemen’s- Land for seven years.
Australia’s nearest approach to Robinson
Crusoe just now is the hatter who has put
in the last seven years on Deliverance
Island, away out. at the western end of
Torres Strait. Years ago Deliverance was
a pearling station, but nowadays it is right
out of the track, and its one inhabitant is
not much worried by visitors. Sometimes
there is as much as a year between calls.
“A.lv.”: Re queer conjunctions of names.
Years ago Alfred Deakin addressed a public
meeting at Glen Innes. Amongst the citi-
zens to welcome the then Prime Minister
were a Bishop, Priest, Nunn, Abbott and
Parsons, while the .color line was repre-
sented by local potentates called Whyte,
Green, Brown, Gray and Salmon. All of
these men were well-known members of the
“centre” at the time of the orator’s visit.
McArdle’s Gap. near Sale (Vic.), pre-
serves the name of the builder of the Enter-
prise, the first steamer that ever ran on the
Gippsland Lakes. While McArdld was on
the job the Government of the day built a
fixed bridge across the Latrobe River below
his boatyard, so that when he had finished
the hooker he could not get it away. For
this he was given £l5OO compensation.
Afterwards a big flood carried away the
bridge and the Enterprise went gaily out to
the lake.
The earliest edition of Phillip’s “Voyage
to Botany Bay,” published in London in
1789, has an appendix giving a complete list
of the names of the First Fleeters. The
Smiths were well to the front with 18 rep-
resentatives ; the Williamses stood next with
1U; the Joneses were a poor third with seven,
and even at that tied with the Allens. There
were six Browns, and the Hills and Davises
dead-heated with them.
G. Sydney Davis, who carries samples from
Brisbane to Thursday Island, the Gulf ports
and Darwin, has been over 50 years “on
the roads.” In the early days, when the
Gulf first began to boom, he used to do the
round trip from Townsville to Normanton
and Burketown with packhorses, and some-
times on his own. Now that he is about
80 he is not as spry as he used to be. and
never gets out of bed before 4 o’clock in
the morning. But, then, he spends most of
his time north of Capricorn.
The aboriginal station at Lake Tyers
( Vic.) saw the finish of a fight between hered-
ity and environment begun in Westralia.
A little black girl named Bessie Flowers
was taken from her tribe over there, adopted
by white people and brought up and edu-
cated as a white. Environment led for a
good many rounds, but finally heredity got
the decision. She married a half-caste and
eiuled up in a mia-mia at the station, where
she “went bush” and gnawed a half-cooked
’possum leg with the wildest black gin on
the place.
“Hugh Stone”: A picturesque new arrival
in the Maoriland Reps, is “Ted” Howard,
who comes from a Christchurch constituency.
He began life as a man-of-warsman, and
was on the Calliope when she steamed out
of Apia (Samoa) harbor through a hell’s
hurricane that swept other war vessels to
their doom in 1889. Howard has also
humped bluey through Australia. At the
time of his election he was sec. of the
Laborers’ Union, Christchurch. Every
week he writes a satirical column for the
M. L. Worker under the name of “The
Yag,” and in the same paper endears him-
self to hundreds of workers’ children as
“Uncle Ted,” the editor of the young folks’
column.
These Sabbaths Sydney Domain’s most
forceful speaker among the regulars is A. D.
Kay, president, of the Citizens’ Democratic
Association, who clerks for a crust and
pleads guilty to being an expert hearse-
driver. He stood unsuccessfully for South
Sydney in 1917. but the C.D.A. is non-
political and non-sectarian, and while it
spreads the printed word on Industrial
Peace and National Unity its president
carries the spoken message to the factories
at dinner-time and gets quite a lot of en-
couragement. Ilis pet scheme is “a tribunal
to be set up pn the job the moment a dispute
takes place, and be disbanded when the
trouble is smoothed out”; and there is only
one plan better than that —the setting up of
Whitley committees on the job to prevent
disputes.
Edmund Jowett. now deputy-leader of the
- Country party in the Reps., is alleged to
own more sheep than anyone else on the
globe. Ilis leases in Queensland and there-
abouts are supposed to total, over 6,000.000
acres, and there’s some very decent country
in that lot. Jovett’s chief hobby, according
to his evidence before the Commission on
the Federal taxation of Crown leases, is
taking up back-country Crown lands and
improving them. The state ot his leased
country is certainly a mighty big contrast
to that of some other big “kings” in the
Never-Never country. As a side-line, Jowett
is keen on climbing family trees. About 300
years ago two of his tribe (they spell their
name Jewett nowadays) went from York-
shire to New England. They now have
about 10,000 descendants in U.S.A.
“Iven-L”: Bulletin mention of Billy
Vowles’s election to the leadership of the
Queensland Opposition reminds me of a time
lie spoke at Maida Hill, near Dalby. There
being no hotel at Maida Hill, he very con-
siderately brought out six bottles of old
Scotch, and having delivered his address
invited his constituents to have a taste. Un-
fortunately someone had already drained the
bottles and filled them with water. The first
hint that something was wrong came from
an old cocky. “If your politics are no
stronger than your whisky, Billy,” he said,
“you don’t get my vote.”
“Wealsman” : The recent Bulletin men-
tion of Chalmers (Hobart) Debating Society
as the incubator of assistant-Minister Laird
Smith recalls the fact that Chalmers was
the first non-political body in Tasmania to
carry a motion in favor of adult suffrage.
Two or three Labor speakers were chal-
lenged to attend Chalmers and debate the
question against speakers chosen by the
society,' the latter taking the negative side
and upholding the continuance of the pro-
perty-vote. Laird Smith was one of the
Labor men’s opponents, and on a vote of
the assemblage at the end of the argument
the visitors won. Five or six years later
Smith drifted cautiously into the Labor
ranks, and in 1910 won the selection ballot
for Denison against Rev. Palaraountairt,
Grant Ilervey was also in the field but was
disqualified before he stripped. The
“Laird” in William Henry Smith’s name
was presented to him by local Labor Coun-
cil chairman Charlie Stevens as a politicaV
stage label. Bill Smith’s maternal rela-
tives were Lairds. As a distinguishing!
badge it acts all right, but it took some
time for the local tongue to get the “Laird”
off pat. To this day many of Bill’s old
toiling mates persist in pronouncing it
“Lard.”
“Eddyson” writes n page in the history
of James Service, ex-Premier of Vic.:—
Alford had started his brewery at The Nob to
compete with Denny’s brewery at Standing for the
trade of the district. Alford’s brewery was about
a size and a half larger than an ordinary suburban
hen-house, but his output, he claimed, was equal
to the district’s demand, ami that was not incon-
siderable, the consumption of beer being the most
popular branch of athletics in those parts. Alford
prided himself on being a great business-man, and
set to work to push his beer in and Denny’s out.
Wherever he came upon an intoxicated citizen he
stuck a label on him: “Drink*Alford’s Beer. Look
at me, and I’ve had five!” If there were two or
more drunks on a pub... verandah sleeping off the
consequences of a recent experiment in sprint drink-
ing, up went Alford’s sign in their midst: “Alford’s
Beer is the best, exquisite in flavor, quick in
action.” Public estimation of the parts of a goal
beer at The Nob and in its neighborhood was based
largely on celerity of effect. Apparently Alford's
beer met the great public need and grew in favor.
It was at this stage that the Premier’s visit wa-
announced. The matter in view was an irrigation
scheme that was to convert the countryside into an
Eden and make every landholder as rich as Jinnm
Tyson. At a little ahead of the appointed time a
smallish man, grey-whiskered, Beaufort-coated and
belltoppered came to The Nob, where he was
exuberantly greeted. His horses were taken out,
and his carriage was dragged to the Shire Hall,
where a “spread” awaited the visitor, whose popu-
larity- was not diminished when it was found he was
doing his best to push the most important local
product, Alford’s beer. On his back was a placard:
“Alford’s Beer is the best. I drink no other.” When
some portion of the refreshments had been forced
down the hero’s throat a grey-whiskered gentleman
in black, supported by two other sober dignitaries,
appeared at the door of the hall, and was barred.
“They’re entertainin’ Mr. Service,” he was told —
“you can’t go in without a card.” “And where
is Mr. Service?” asked the latecomer. “That’s him
at the head of the table.” “Oh, indeed!” The
stranger turned to his two friends. “In that case,”
he said, “I suppose I can get to the hotel and go
to bed, thank Heaven!” The man at the head of
the table was only an advertising dodge put up by
Alford, that had worked out all too well under the
stimulus of public enthusiasm. It was James
Service who went to the hotel to bed.
A. E. O’Brien, better known to Laborites
as “The Widow,” is more nearly a cer-
tainty for the N. S. Wales Upper House
than any other Laborite; and there must be
some Labor appointments to balance the
many that are being made from the other
ranks. “The Widow,” who draws £6OO a
year from the Musicians’ Union and Club,
is the highest-paid union official in Sydney;
and as he has been the soul of a movement
which started when the instrumentalist in
the theatre orchestra was regarded as a man
who had a job in the daytinde and was paid
accordingly for his evening’s work, lie has
proved well worth the money. At times lie
has appeared before the public as conductor
of the Professional Musicians’ Rand; and,
apart from that, he is an excellent performer
on his own trumpet.
“Mac” : Torn Burke, who recently bought
and presented Pin.schof’s Studley Hall to
Xavier College, where his boys are taught,
had his early training on hard soil. His
mother—a careful little Scotchwoman —

at Ararat. Tom’s after-school exercise in-
cluded taking two baskets, one of butter, the
other of eggs, for sale to the families of

graduated to a railway clerk and rose to the
top of his class; and when he became assist-
ant S.M. he batched with a mate in the gate-
house and remitted two-thirds of his salary

ON A MATE’S DEATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Majestic Death sweeps up from Dis,
Uis ancient, gloomy edifice,
And with a kingly, grim disdain.
Makes weak the puissant ones again,
And hurls the high to the abyss.
So runs the legend ; but I wis
The legend lies, for here I miss
A king’s insignia—-seek in vain, Majestic
Death!
I hear the agonising hiss
That, like a stealthy Judas-kiss,
Sucks out the last poor breath of pain,
And see the petty pilferer, plain....
This sneak-thief of' the dark! Is this Majestic
Death ?

Australia's first duty is to provide employment for her soldier
sons. Only by making here goods now imported can such
additional employment be given. If all the Iron and Steel
Products now imported were made by our own people, work
at Australian rates of wages would be given to not less than
30,000 Men
who would receive in wages more than
£5,000,000 Per Year
These 30,000 workers in turn would give support to over
120,000 Others
By these means large numbers of skilled mechanics would
be available as munition workers in time of need.
Every Australian should realise that
The Australian Iron and Steel Industry
is a NATURAL Industry, a KEY Industry, a BASIC Industry.

HANG IT
BY THE
Siesta.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A FEW coclieros sat half-asleep on their
boxes, watching the horses’ tails
flicking off flies with the skilled pre-
cision of habit. Calle Maipu sat back com-
fortable in the Buenos Aires midday, which
in the summer is from 11 to 2. Every-
thing slept—cobble-stones, waiters, shops
and trams. Even the bright air leaned
heavily against the tumbled Spanish houses,
deep in the sacred sleep. Dixon, hurrying
down the street, thought of the two hours he
had before he must leave for Mendoza again,
the two hours he had left himself in which
to see old Alvarez about the camp supplies.
Fresh from the campo, Dixon had forgotten
this damned siesta. Well, he had to find Al-
varez and speak his piece about rotten bully-
beef, jf he did it by the old thief’s bedside;
he couldn’t afford the time till to-morrow's
train.
The, black-eyed girl on the balcony in the
patio was the only sign of life he lrad found
in the city. She looked down at him with
the eternal half-smile in the big black eyes as
he entered and rapped at Alvarez’s door.
“There is no one there, Sefior,” she said,
“it. is the siesta.”
"1 know,” said Dixon, “but it is very im-
portant, Senorita. Can you tell me where l
can find Sefior Alvarez or his clerkV”
The/-eye® opened wide at Dixon's off-hand
sacrilege. These toco ingles!
“But, it is the siesta”——
"Yes, yes. But 1 have only a little time
and it is most, important!”
The smile came back into the eyes (tine-
looking girl, Dixon thought) as she stood up
from the balcony rail and turned away.
"You can see Sefior Alvarez at two
o’clock,” she lisped in a gentle murmur that
hardly broke the holy sleep of the earth.
“But, Sefiorita, I must” A shadow
of laughter lapsed in music on the stillness
as the door softly closed. Dixon sighed,
and turned again to that other door where
the old swine should have been. It was
ridiculous! The railway was tin* best cus-
tomer Alvarez had or was ever likely to have.
Eleven tins of beef from which the mules
bolted when they were opened; and he
couldn-’t even be in his office when
he was wanted! Damn it, it looked
like to-morrow, after all; and young
Challis probably getting tight in Men-
doza and everything gone to blazes, lie
thought of leaving a note pinned on the
door. But no, Alvarez wouldn’t take any
notice of it; the only thing was to stand
over him and frighten the soul out of him.
If he knew where he lived ! He stared vaguely
at the door and window of the office for in-
spiration ; and through the window he saw
old Alvarez sitting well back in his chair
and reading La Prensa, his back turned
to the window to get the light. Oh, good!
He could catch his train, after all; his first
knock hadn’t been heard evidently. He rap-
ped sharply on the door; and, after a pause,
again. (No answer; no sign of life. Was
Alvarez deaf or dead? He walked to the
window and rapped on that. The white head
busy with the newspaper did not move.
"He, Sefior!” called Dixon; “Sefior
Alvarez! It is I, Dixon, from the Ferro
(Jar-ril del Sad!” Alvarez turned a n
in stony unconsciousness of the row. Damn
him! The British had busted this midday
loaf years ago, in all but the oldest, deadest
Spanish offices. Perhaps this was a protest.
Dixon- did his best to kick down the door
and to break the window; but to no purpose.
The old man inside steadily read his paper
and smoked his cigarillo in tomb-like oblivion
of the echoing ravaged initio. At last Dixon
in despair gave it up; he walked to the
grass chair by the fountain-basin and threw
himself into it, a beaten man.
Some doves murmured and crooned about
the roof; and a girl was singing a low
lullaby near—perhaps that fine girl with the
big eyes who had leaned over the balcony-
rail and laughed at him. No other sounds
assailed the silence, save the softer
lullaby, of the water falling in the basin.
The dark palms and orange-trees stood
motionless in their tubs on the tiled floor.
The light; filtered through the awnings in
a cool, dull glow of rest, of immortal peace.
The eartll was a backwater of silence and
twinkling waters, of cooing doves and girls
making slumber-songs for tired engineers.
Outside in the street, stray cabs and motors
went by in apologetic hurry; a train
whistled in the distance —an English train,
knotving nothing of the sanctity of siesta.
Faint cries and voices far away sounded
sometimes for an instant, and fell back into
the cool silence, the silence of the mutter-
ing doves and that lullaby girl, of that whis-
pering, never-ending water. Up at Mendoza
Challis (if he was sober) was sweating with
a theodolite and a bunch of yelling peones.
all boiling in 120 deg., with eight miles of
sand and gruelling work before them. Three
months of it, bully-beef and work and sleep,
and sand, plenty of sand, red-hot. Here in
the shy*twilight a man had time to sit and
think a bit. Of the old days in Txmdon.
and the rain and cold, the struggle and
poverty and work. Of the new days in
Buenos Aires, and the good sunshine, the
hard work and the good pay. Poor Challis '
It must be a stinker up there.... The doves
still mumbled round the awnings; and that
fine girl still hummed her Spanish cradle-
song. Half-thoughts came slumbrously
near, touched him and made a lapsing, lisp-
ing music for a moment —lit up again for
a, moment two • slumbrous black eyes—
laughed in a shadow of sound —and slipped
back into the other shadow's of the mid-
day. Perhaps to-morrow’s train would
do — Manana, Manana, the spirit of the
country....
Dixon slept, with tlrtr water and the palms
and the twilight. The cradle-song ceased,
and the doves fell at last into rest, with
all the world. The Cathedral’s bells chiming
two o’clock made a difficult way through the
mists round Dixon’s mind. He looked up
at old Alvarez standing smiling by the chair.
“Ah. Sefior Dixon, buen ’ din. buen ’ din!
You take your siesta in the good old-
fashioned way. I see. We are not all so
lucky that we can spare the time. Come
in—come in. Now, what can I do for you?'

Goodyear Belts Satisfy the Sawmill Engineer
WHEN Goodyear Belts were first brought under their
notice, sawmill engineers were sceptical about our
claims of super-efficiency.
To-day, however, there is abundant proof that Goodyear-equipped
transmissions will meet every expectation of better service an
economy of operation.
Our files hold records of tests made and service given on Planers and Matchers
equipped with Goodyear Belts. Every condition of high speed and almost invar,able
overloading was met. Goodyear Belts transmitted from pulleys of small diameter fu
capacity of power, and proved their strength and flexibility throughout a long life of wear.
The special type of transmission
on sawmilling machinery calls
for a special type of belt to meet
that service. But this is true of
every different kind of drive.
There is a Goodyear Belt de-
signed and built for every kind
of belting service. Moreover,
there is a Goodyear Technical
Man within call who will de-
monstrate how to adapt your
belts to the actual conditions of
work. His specialised knowledge
and continuous experience of
results will assist you to secure
not only the maximum service
in belts and Consequent econ-
omies of factory operation, but
will insure the effective trans-
mission of power with its
accompaniment of maximum
output of machines or plant.
Our specification of Goodyear Belt-
ing carries with it the acceptance of
responsibility for its satisfactory
service and wear.
Slocks of Goodyear Mechanical
Rubber Goods are now carried

Of the year’s loss £5302 was incurred during
the flu half, when the picture shows were
l»ut out of business for a time by Govern-
ment restrictions. The shipping strike also
interfered with the circuiting of films. So
during that term it cost £9718 to earn
. For tlie June-December period
* r~Y " ross O r6fit showed up at a cost
or £0921; but that half-year had its troubles.
100. -twelve months ago the management
decided that £llOO which had been to the
credit ot a bad debts reserve was no longer
required for that purpose, and the amount
was dropped into P. and L. again, thus mak-
ing the 1918 results look better than they
really were. But in the latest accounts the
directors admit having discovered £1(537 of
bad debts, and after this amount had been
written off and allowances made for depre-
ciation the latest six months’ run ended with
a loss of £203. The past four years have
been very cheerless; but conditions have
.<m abnormal. It is not clear whether they
will improve sufficiently in the near future
to give the eo. an opportunity to regain its
lost punch. It started off with good inten-
tions, and though the promoters’ cut repre-
sented practically half the paid capital, it

' ust about that time the overseas producer

strenuous competition of the big local film-
distributing combine, Avith its more widelv-
assorted wares, this small co-op. concern
having insufficient capital available to give
it driving force, began to feel the strain
Since then one difficulty lias been heaped

tied up in films and book debts. But liabili-
ties are still formidable. Paid capital is only

This gas co., like others, Las had a sec-saw
existence, lately, with a price-fixing Commis-
sion always available to adjust the balance
so that the statutory div. of 8 p.c. allowed
by the Gas Act might be weighed out to
shareholders. However, the latest profits as
shown above include a £3007 addition to the
plant-renewal account (£2BOO was tacked on
in 1018), and if that was a fair allowance
actual net profits disclosed were £lOO short
of the dividend requirements. Tilings would
have been much worse for the co. than that
if the Government had not obliged with an
amendment of the 1912 Gas Act, practically-
assuring shareholders 8 p.c.—anyway, giving
them every chance to earn 8 p.c. When
working costs threaten that return, the co.
collects its papers and goes to court; last
year it made several appearances and “appli-
cations for authority to make increases in
flic price charged for gas were granted in
each ease.” Meantime Manlv is steadily
expanding, so the miles of gas'and residuals
have increased rapidly. Here is a six years’
survey of income and outgo (including re-
newals reserve appropriations) :
Sales. Expenses. Sales. Expenses.
1914. . £18.277 £12,110 1917. . £28,116 £24,320
1010.. 23,192 17,961 1918.. 32,833 27,296
1916.. 24,221 20,095 1919.. 36,567 31,216
Thus sales receipts have just doubled since
1014; but expenses are more than 24 times
greater.
Balance-sheet figures over the same period
have moved in this way:—
1914. 1918. 1919.
Capital .. ..£63,750 £68,250 £68,250
Liabilities . . 11,671 22,158 25,874
Fixed assets .. 76,484 96,933 102,817
Liquid assets . . 3,625 4,928 6,316
Of th(> liabilities £21,450 represents loan
capital. To finance extensions now contem-
plated a new retort outfit and carbonising
plant, and an additional gas-holder to feed
outlying districts —considerable further
funds will be required ; so shareholders will
probably be invited to put up some more
capital. If the 8 p.c. which the Gas Act
permits is to be paid on this lot, too, it
seems likely that Manly gas will become
another penny or two dearer, for the new
works will not. for a time at any rate, bring
in sufficient additional revenue to pay mat
rate of dividend on the whole capital. Prob-
ably calls on any new issue will be well
spread, for about 18 months will elapse be-
fore the new works are completed.

Most of this co.’s business is in pastoral pro-
ducts, and largely wool and sheep off the
shears; so the publication of accounts half-
yearly. instead of yearly is a mistake. Traf-
fic revenue for the past six months was
£16,711 compared with £11.1(00 for the same
term of last year; probably higher freights
are responsible for some of the increase.
Latest profits would have been even greater
had not £2722 more than a year ago been
spent on the permanent way and for re-
newals. Still the co. is doing much better
with its little line, which connects the not-
too-moist Deniliquin (N.S.W.) district wtih
the Victorian system, than the N. S. Wales
Government can with its railways. After
having renewed and kept its assets in repair
and paid an average c’.iv. of almost 6$ p.c.
p.a. on the capital originally paid up by
shareholders— £2s.ooo of the present paid
capital of £125,000 represents reserves capi-
talised eight years ago—the co. has shown
this improvement during the past 14 years:

Liabilities . . . . 30,917 230 2,470
Excess liabilities ..£19,663
Surplus assets .. £14,151 £22,167
All but £4310 of the liquid assets at Decem-
hor 31 were War Loan and cash; and since
1005 the liquid position has been improved
by £40,830, or at the rate of £2900 p.a. That,
however, is not necessarily all profit. Some
ot it may be a provision for special replace-
ments and renewals.
Good Australian ’: The Gold Producers’
Association made a profit of 16s. 7d. per oz.
on 780,3.j70z. it sent abroad by Government
permission, and producers were paid a divi-
dend for the six months of 13s. per standard
oz. It would be interesting to know who sold
all tins gold and who bought it. Is it all
finding its way to America via Hongkong and
lokohama, or are the Chinese, Japs and
Hindoos buying it to bury? It looks as
though the Government ought to resume
control of Australia’s gold and place an
embargo on its export. This country is not
likely to need meat or wheat very badly, but
it ought to keep all the gold it can against
the fast-approaching rainy day. Common-
wealth notes are valueless for paying debts
outside Australia, and gold alone can be used
for that purpose. Why should this country
commit financial suicide by allowing private
persons to rush its gold away to foreign
countries? Gold is the basis of our credit
and currency, and as exports of goods are
now big enough to pay any debts abroad gold
should be kept here.
“O.B.”: Hampton Plains promises to be
a lucrative locality for Gents. One. Right
of possession is being disputed here, there
and everywhere, and threats of litigation are
numerous. In one case a prospector sold a
block for £lOO cash and a tenth interest;
the buyer passed it on to a co. for £lOOO.
and is then said to have tendered the pros-
pector a further £lOO cash, which he reck-
oned represented a “tenth interest.’’ The
prospector refused the proffered amount, and
has since lodged a caveat against any deal-
ings in the lease. How the co. which is
working the area will fare is not quite clear.
Boulder Perseverance is still in the hands
of the liquidator, who hints that another
div. is in the air. Cleland controls the old
show and promises £2OOO a month if let go
on with tributors. All the ore broken in
the stof>es has now gone through the mill,
03,.165 tons having been treated last year.
Together with royalties and the bit from
slags, a revenue of £264,395 showed up;
but it cost £245,000 to earn it. The final
disbursement, if tributors are not allowed
to skirmish in the vitals of the mine, will
come when a buyer is prepared to make
a decent bid for all the veteran has left
to offer.
The granite rocks of the Andes of Aus-
tralia—a very worn-down Andes in these
days, but an imposing range once —can be
traced all the way from the islands of Torres
Strait to the south of Tasmania. Granites
are well developed in Moa and other islands;
they bob up in the Gape York Peninsula
and down through Queensland; then in New
England and Monaro and elsewhere in N. S.
Wales. You can follow them in Eastern
Vic. right down to Wilson’s Promontory,
across the eastern end of Bass Straits, where
most of the islands show fine granite masses.
There is a great outcrop in the tin country
of the north-east of the Speck, and the now-
isolated areas of Schouten Main and
Schouten Island and of the eastern side of
Maria Island, all associated with more or
less tin, continue the line til! it dips under
the Southern Ocean for good, unless the
granite country around Cox’s Bight, in the
extreme south of Tasmania, with the most
southerly deposits of tin yet worked in the
world, be assigned to the same system.

Western Electric Power and
Light is making the World
BRIGHTER for Democracy!
_____ Way out west, up north and in the remotest parts
of Australia, this outfit brings the comfort and convenience of elec-
tricity and the labour-saving devices that go with it. Western Elec-
tric Power and Light has plenty of surplus power. The Battery has
a capacity of 180 Ampere Hours more than double the capacity of ordinary light-
ing outfits. This means that in addition to electric light there is plenty of current
always for operating an electric iron or fan, washing machine, sewing machine,
vacuum cleaner, toaster or cooker. A few extra lights or a motor going ovettime
wont worry the battery.
Western Electric Power and Light comprises a 3Vi h.p. Engine, a 1500 Watt Generator, 180 Ampere Hour
Battery and a switchboard which, controls the whole outfit When not charging the battery, simply press
a switch and you get the full power of the Engine for driving light machinery -a very valuable feature.
The Engine uses kerosene, feeds itself with fuel and oil, starts by pressing a lever, stops automatically when
the battery is fully charged, is air-cooled and throttle-governed.
It is a plant that gives happiness because of its endless uses. Over 50 years of electrical engineering ex-
perience stand behind it as a guarantee of reliability and efficiency Therefore, when you decide to have
electricity, whether in homestead, store, school, church, hall, or hotel, don’t buy an outfit thats too smal ,
Get the Western Electric Outfit because it’s big and strong with plenty of light and power for all uses.

A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“C.M.S.” : Here’s an addition to the Jap-
anese method of catching the octopus, as related
by “Bill Bowyang.” It is practised by the Maltese
and other fishermen in the Mediterranean. On the
surface of the water, at likely places in the rocks,
the Dago spreads a thin film of oil. He then
searches the bottom by means of a primitive spy-
glass rested on the oil film. This implement is
made out of a jam tin, the top taken off and the
bottom replaced by a sheet of glass. (I have tried
it and located a ring in about two fathoms on a
bottom that didn’t make for good visibility.) Hav-
ing spotted his game, the fisher either gets it
straight with a barbed spear or a sharp book on
a rigid pole, or lures it into a favorable position
with a bait of meat.
CALLING NAMES.
THE CANDIDATE : I arming is the backbone
of the country.”
THE VOTER: Well, what’s politics? The
collar-bone?”
“Kid-O”: “L. N. Tommy” (B. 26/2/’2O)
states that “some authorities contend that S. Aus.
abos. were not given to cannibalism” ; but as canni-
balism was the fashion in Bananaland I don’t see
why it should not also have been customary in S.A.
The late Tom Petrie, a Bananaland authority on local
blacks, held that, although the abos. never killed
solely for food, they invariably ate all who were
killed in fight, while to have a morsel of a “turra-
wan” (great man) was considered highly beneficial.
The blacks’ ideas concerning the body of a great
man were quaint. For instance, their excuse for
eating a departed identity was that his good name
would not be blemished by his “stink.”
* * •» *
“Surveyor” : 'Severed a bulldog-ant at the
waist the other day, and 10 minutes later noticed
the head and legs wrestling with the dining-room.
Mas it trying to reach a quiet spot and join up
again, or had the business-end stung the head in
mistake for somebody else?
“Haka”: On hearing the news of Jack
Currie’s death Henare downed shears and went into
mourning. He spent the next day at the pub, and
left no beer unturned in informing the inhabitants
t'at “Chack Currie te plurrv white man, py cripes ;
he tie te plurrv pity. I lose te t’ree-tay pay I ride
over te funeral.” On the day of the burial Henare
was on the board as usual. “What's wrong?”
chipped the boss. “I thought you were going to
Jack Currie’s funeral.” “Cripes, you can’t to t’at,”
answered Henare. “Jim Green, town te pub, tell
me it te plurry private entertainment.”
* if- * *
“1.H.M.”: “McNorth” (B. 19/2/’2O)
missed it when he said that the green-backed turtle
scoops a hole 2ft. square for its eggs. Raine Island
(N.Q.) is three-quarters of a mile long by a quarter
of a mile broad, with a beach, about a hundred yards
wide all round it. Hundreds of the reptiles used
to crawl up from the sea during the night to lay
their eggs. They scooped out the sand with their
large front dippers until they had a conical pit
about 3ft. in diameter at the top. They then drilled
a smaller hole at the bottom of the larger one with
their hind flippers, and in this deposited their
fruit, filling in the cavities when they had finished
laying. Some of the turtles went beyond the beach
into the centre of the island, but most of these died
of exhaustion. The stench when a breeze W’as blow-
ing across the land w'ould make an Angora billy
green with horror.
“Pisces”: Sea-lice are common along the
Queensland coast. At Pialba, when a stiff northerly
is blowing, they are specially active and so numerous
that they may be caught in a bucket. These lice
are small and are capable of giving the surfer nothing
more than an itching bite, but a much larger variety-
fix themselves in the throats of some of the reef-
haunting fish. They seem to subsist on what they
can obtain from the food of the host. I have removed
one three-quarters of an inch long from the throat
of a. big bream, yet the bream w-as as lively and
fought as gamely in the water as could be wished
for. No sore was visible at the place where the
louse lay. There’s another found in fresh water.
Got one in a shrimp-net, a brown chap, resembling
its salt-w'ater relation, in the upper reaches of the
Albert River (Q.). But I don’t know this fellow’s
habits.
“Centurion”: “Senex” and others on
octopus as a table delicacy recalls that the spidery
horror is very popular with the aborigines of the
Levant. I have seen it adorning stalls and . shop-
windows in Alexandria and Port Said. Almost any
Dago loves the gristly provender, which is retailed
whole or by the piece, and always cold.
“Dr. Nil” : Re “Temora's” argument anent
the red-backed (black) spider (B.
19/2/’2O). In 1889 1 was in Hill-
ston (N.S.W.), and there was quite
an epidemic of bites by this arach-
nide. The cases I had ranged from
moderately- to exceedingly-severe, but,
like “Temora,” I have never know
of a death from this cause. The symp-
toms and signs are as follows: Severe
pain at the spot bitten and radiating
along main neighboring nerve-trunks ;
slow' pulse and breathing; pallor and
sweating and sleeplessness, and some-
times nausea—in fact, many of the
appearances of shock. I never found
local treatment did any good. Alcohol
and warmth are somewhat useful.
It was the fashion in the time men-
tioned above to rub on, or even inject
hypodermically, strong liquid ammonia.
Except that, in the latter case, it
produced a local ulcer, this treatment
was of no effect. I have had a few
scattered cases since in South Aus-
tralia, but never such a series as in
1899, which suggests that venomous
insects, and perhaps venomous ani-
mals, have their “mild” and “severe”
seasons. The last case I had near
Adelaide a few days, ago was quite
typical, and nothing did any good
but morphia, which of late years I
have always used.
■Rwa”: Up in N.Q. Binghi makes music
not only with a gum-leaf, but also with the leaf of
the weeping-fig, which is better than the gum, as
it has a ridge in the centre. One half the leaf is
placed against the upper lip, and by means of
blowing and pressing the bottom half of it to the
lower lip the sound is produced. The different notes
are graded in much the same way as one plays a
bugle—-by pressing close for the higher notes and
slackening for the lower notes. Good players can
place the leaf right inside the mouth and play any
tune they know, but how this is done passes me. I
heard a band of half a dozen boys in Townsville
playing a popular air with the vegetation, and would
recommend the performance in preference to some of
the band discords you have around Svdney.
* * * ■»
“Dolphin” : Near the southern end of King
Island, the specklet of 270,000 acres at the western
end of Bass Straits, is a Valley of Death. Scattered
thickly over a sandy' hollow of several acres are the
bones of kangaroo, wallaby, emu and dozens of other
beasts and birds. Thousands upon thousands of
animals must have perished there, and apparently
not such a long while ago. One theory is that they
were driven into a corner and caught by a bush-
fire. It does not seem very likely, but there is
nothing likelier in the field.
“Wandi”: The most inveterate match
cadger I ever struck was Larry the Rook. On a
well-travelled track he would fill his pocket in a
day. lie saved all available empty boxes, which
he carried in another pocket. On meeting a way-
farer he would take out one of these empties to
light his pipe, express annoyance at finding nothing
in it, and ask the other man if he had a match.
Invariably he was handed a box, and after lighting
up he rattled the box as he handed it back. When
the lender subsequently required a match, he was
THEY'D FEED HIS EARS IF SOT
HIS MOUTH.
"And here’s a penny for you, my good man.”
"Blimey, missus, couldn’t you make it a
couple o' ha’pennies? — I’d hear a jingle
then, anyfow”
surprised to find his .box empty. Larry worked
the trick by holding the full box in the palm of
his hand and an empty between thumb and fore-
finger, the former being afterwards dropped into
his own pocket. Shaking the box when lending it
and passing it back is a general custom in the
hush, but it isn’t etiquette for the lender to shake
the box on receiving it back from the borrower.
“Nor’-West”: I doubt whether the bite of
a red-backed spider would prove fatal in the case
of a healthy adult, but I know of a small boy who
was killed by one of the little devils. The young-
ster’s name was Burgess, and he was picking black-
berries near his home in Tenterfield (N.S.W.) when
he was bitten. Prompt medical aid was obtained,
but blood-poisoning won the fight. An adult friend
of mine who was bitten by one of these spiders
had a very bad time, with periods of partial paralysis
from the effects of the venom. He was under medi-
cal attendance for some days.
“Te Wliare”: The great grey kangaroo
{Macropus major) now ranks as the biggest mar-
supial, but a fossil kangaroo (Macropus atlas) dis-
covered by Mitchell in the caves of Wellington
Valley (N.S.W.) was at least one-third larger.
Mitchell also brought to light the fossil remains of
an extinct species of wombat and opossum (phal-
anger), but differing little from tne existing species.
Another extinct marsupial was the kangaroo labelled
Macropus titan. It was just as tall as Macropus
atlas, but had smaller teeth. A fossil native cat
(Dasyurus baniarius) was considerably larger than
the existing species, now itself almost wiped out
by poison. Professor Owen, who examined the speci-
mens, concluded that these mammals were all of
species peculiar to Australia, and were certainly not
the remains of any existing species. Owen was also
supplied with a couple of teeth, from which he diag-
nosed a diprotodon, a beast of the dugong species.
“Wessel”: Some day the so-called gutta-
percha tree, which is fairly common in swampy
country in the Northern Territory, may prove of
value. It exudes a milky substance which hardens
on exposure to the air and has gained it the name
it carries. The tree yields a kind of turpentine,
and there is good reason to suppose that it would
provide fine fuel for a suction-gas plant.
* * * *
‘‘Bill R.”: “Jim Carew” asks (B.
26/2/’2O) why peace pourparlers have not been
tabled between snakes and gohannas. Well, the
snake’s chief diet is lizard, with young gohannas
regularly on the menu. The gohanna’s appetite is
satisfied with any living thing he can overcome,
but snake for choice. Naturally regarding each other
as tucker, snake and go’ attack every time they
meet. I have found that when the combatants are
about equal in size and vigor long odds may be
laid on the gohanna, whose stout legs and claw-
hold gi-re an advantage. Apparently, too, he has
the further advantage of being able to keenly scent
his legless foe. Often I have observed a go’ with
head erect making rapid side to side sniffs, tip-
toeing cautiously in search of his enemy. When
scented out, should the snake appear too formidable,
the stalker wishes him a polite good morning and
streaks for the horizon; but should the descendant
of Cleopatra's asp look manageable, the big fellow
sails in. Every fight I have witnessed has been to
the death, with the gohanna top-horror.

“Riverina” : They were great days when
bush beer went to its destination per horse-waggon,
a team often facing a journey of 80 or 100
miles. This meant several days’ travel, and the arri-
val of the chariot was an event that stirred town-
ship society to its depths. On the voyage the ea.-k-;
were gencrou.-h
tapped, the usual
method being in
knock up a hoop
and use a gimlet.
When sufficient
liquid wa s
drawn the hole
was plugged and
the hoop replaced.
The beer track
was popular and
the carter a hero.
Sundowners d i d

company. Very few
drivers would refuse
a billyful to a thirsti
soul. Sometimes the
gatherings along the
route were notable
affairs that ran to con-
certs and fights. I
remember with pious
joy a sight on
a plain in N. S. Wales
one scorcher of a day.
Among the barrels
were four well-sonkr'
swaggies with their
luggage. The horses

them wobbled the
conductor loud in song. He was clad only in hat,
boots and fluttering shirt.
“Baree”: They say the aborigines are
dying out. Not in Darwin, anyhow. A lubra at the
compound is the proud mother of 10 piccaninnies.
Another musters eight, and two others have six each.
* * * *
“G.”: “D.F.” is right in contradicting
Mathews’s statement in his “Birds of Australia”
that ground parrots are extinct. Some years ago on
the N.S.W.-Q. border, near Glen limes and Stan-
thorpe, I saw flocks house-hunting in a big gum-
tree. Saw numbers of them, too, in 1918 and in
1919. The male birds have a lot of trouble in
arranging sleeping-quarters, as each has several wives
to please, and the missuses like different hollows to
lay their eggs in. All other parrots 1 know keep
in pairs.
“Pingin”: My experiences out on the rim
in Westralia only recently would convince any
sane man of the ability of black trackers. I had
20 horses running loose, and Binghi would bring me
any particular one if I showed him a track —it did
not matter about the marks being a few days old.
Dingoes raided my goat-herd (60 strong) at dead
of night. Next day one of my best milkers was
missing. It took Binghj about two hours to get
on her track and another four hours to hand her
over to me. Just think of the confusion of tracks
and marvel at the thoroughness that could do a
job like that.
“Barcoo” : “Raw Newchum”(B. 19/2/’2O),
after complaining that a crow had pirated his fowl
eggs, dolefully inquires what the thief does with the
spoil. If he will treat it as confidential I’ll give him
the information. The crow, a wise bird, carries the
eggs home to his bride, who attends to their incuba-
tion. On completion of the process Mr. and Mrs.
Crow dine joyously off spring chicken.

AFTER RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oil. the woods are dripping, dripping, and the skies
above are grey,
And the tiny rivulets are flowing down and far
away,
And the passing carts arc making great wheelmarks
on the road,
Mith the great brown horses steaming before the
heavy load.
With their leather harness straining
To their patient, plodding feet.
It’s been raining, raining, raining—
And the world is cool and sweet.
Oil. the freshness of the damp earth and the drip-
ping of the trees!
And the stillness of the morning—not the stirring
of a breeze!
From far away among the hills, the rain-mist slowly
clears;
The sun peeps through and turns the gentle drops
to crystal tears;
From somewhere comes the half-caught scent of
rose and violet,
And in the heart of every flower a jewel lingers yet.

“Tramp N.Q.”: Passing from Ttoeklianip-

the scene of some high adventures in the
days when the blacks were occasionally “dis-
persed” by the native police. At the foot
of the weird mountain I drank a cheering cup

time some good gold finds were made. History has it
that a posse of police chased a mob of aggressive
niggers up Mount Wheeler from the slopes at the
far side, and so bustled them that most of the tribe
leaped over a precipice to avoid their pursuers.

“Bardoc”: Another harrowing chapter in
the history of bush surgery. A Steppes (Tas.)
shepherd, aged 19, saw his dog bitten by a snake,
and after staggering about 10 yards the hound died.
The following night the youth awoke to discover
his big toe bleeding, and he was feeling very queer.
Terrified lest he, too, had been assaulted by a snake
he attacked his toe with a blunt axe, but only suc-
ceeded in breaking the member. Then he grabbed
a razor and hacked off portion of his wounded flesh.
Having battered and gashed himself into semi-
delirium, he spent half an hour finding his horse
and rode 10 miles to some neighbors. When he
was taken to Bothwell, about 30 miles away, he
learned that it couldn’t have been a snake-bite at
all! The remains of the toe were removed at the
Hobart General Hospital.
“Pick”: The best “tracking” record I
know is that of Black Curly, a Goulburn (N.S.W.)
Binghi of the ’eighties. He started on the two-
days-old trail of a lost child in the Gunning Ranges,
followed it for five days, and picked up the kiddy
at Windcradeen, 27 miles away. Several times
he had told the company “little pfeller carry corn-
bag.” The bag was there when the youngster was
rounded up. He had found it on the way and
taken it along for a bed.

“Double TJ P”: I have used garlic as a
preventive of blackleg for over 40 years, and dur-
ing that time I have treated between 20 and 30
thousand calves, many of them on farms that were
swept clean of infant cows by blackleg for two
years previously. On some places they were dying
at the rate of 10 per day. On four farms that
adjoin my place more than 100 head of calves died
this year, besides a few animals from two to four
years, though they were all inoculated with the
different blackleg specifics. Not one animal tnat
I gave garlic to pegged out, and I reared over 50
last year surrounded by the disease.
“Senex”: In 1914 a young fellow was
admitted to Atherton (Q.) Hospital suffering from
the bite of a red-hacked spider. While he (the
man) was scrub-falling, the insect dropped down
inside his shirt and bit him on the stomach. He
just rubbed some washing ammonia on the place
and didn’t bother any more about it until he became
so ill that he had to be stretchered in to the line
and thence to hospital. lie was delirious on arrival,
and the bite was indicated by a lump the size of
two fists. This was immediately opened and a
draining tube had to be used for more than a week.
Doctor had grave doubts about the case for 10 days,
and it was nearly a month before the patient
recovered. P.S. —I know; I was his attendant.

The plentiful Binghi at Bel tana (S.A.)
has been roused to frenzy. Angipena Billy, a person
of local consequence, was buried lately. Now some
enemy has visited the lonely grave, dug up portions
of Billy, and placed his head on a stake near by. The
local Binghi swears that he will do the same and
more to the humorist if he can be found ; and as
he is supposed to have come from a certain tribe
farther out, something is likely to be doing up that
way shortly.
* * * *
“Hay”: I can’t think with “Jim Carew”
(B. 5/2/’2O) that Binghi had a secret system of
telegraphy. Years of observation and a knowledge
of the language of the blacks of Centralia have con-
vinced me that they had no other means of com-
municating at a distance than an elaborate system
of smoke signals. The time chosen for working
the messages was just about sunrise, when in
Centralia the atmosphere is usually very calm and
clear, and the signal station was always the highest
point handy. The smoke was regulated by green
branches so as to send up columns of varying thick-
ness according to an arranged code.

“Gouger”: About the most remarkable
instance of presence of mind in my experience
occurred recently while a mob of us were crossing
a narrow but swiftly-flowing North Queensland
river. The boat capsized and the only man who
couldn’t swim went to the bottom. Picking up a
heavy rock, he started to walk up the gradually-
sloping bank. The rest of us, after swimming to
dry ground, were feeling pretty dismal, when out
of the water emerged the gasping head of our
supposedly-drowned mate. The weight of the
boulder had enabled him to walk under the water.
“'Vessel”: Is there, after all, any founda-
tion for the belief that the crocodile likes its food
high and plants it in the mud till it is gamey ?
Men in the North who have seen as much as they
want to see of crocs, have told me that they have
never come across any evidence in support of the
theory. There seems, by the way, to be a certain
amount of foundation for a very old belief that
the crocodile sheds tears. He lias well-developed
tear-ducts, at any rate. Perhaps they are useful
for washing the mud out of his eyes.
“1.H.M.”: A sandalwood getter on the
Batavia River (N.Q.) pitched his camp about 40vds.
from the water. During the night a croc, pushed
his snout under the mosquito net, grabbed him fey
the hip and commenced lugging him to the river.
The Bingliis in the camp pelted the croc, with stieks,
stones and anything that was handy, and eventually
persuaded him to clear out, but not until he had
dragged his yelling victim within 20 yards of his
dining saloon.
“Senex”: In the Tolga (N.Q.) district,
after supplying lashins of good, sweet water during
the recent long dry spell, several wells went dry
immediately the wet started. Have a dim recollec-
tion of hearing of wells doing that elsewhere? Any
explanation ?
* * * *
“W errimee”: In these expensive times,
when the cost of courting has gone up, like every-
thing else, the amorous bloke ’way back has much
to be thankful for. He can pursue the eternal
attraction for any length of time without overtax-
ing his pocket. Bill’s sweetheart expects to be
taken to any sports and entertainments that eventuate,
but as these don’t eventuate often they don’t make
much of a gap in Bill’s income, lie can buy her
a saddle (it will be a useful asset after marriage)
for no more than the city man expends on a couple
of motor rides, and that sums up all his travelling
expenses. Not that he travels anyway extensively;
most times he is quite content to sit on a log with
his arm round her waist, and there’s the mutual feel-
ing that life on a log is the overture to paradise.
I envy Bill!
"Bung”: Though stately and slow when
wheeling aloft on the lookout, an eagle, by means
of a downward plunge, can unwind a turn of speed
that makes him the most rapid bird a-wing. The
dive is a headlong rush with wings partly closed,
but the momentum is increased by short inward
strokes of the fore-wings. Over the bluff that banks
the western shores of Lake George I saw some crows
attack an eagle that was serenely corkscrewing
aloft with a rabbit dangling in his claws. Suddenly
the big fellow let go his lunch to fend off his assail-
ants. He side-winged a few of their onslaughts,
scattered the mob with a screeching charge, and
then dived in pursuit of the falling dinner. I could
hear him tearing through the air. The rabbit must
have had 100 yards start towards the earth, but when
just about to strike the trees on the hill-side, the
eagle, with a tremendous curving swoop, recovered
his property and soared upwards again far above
the lake. The crows made a few disgruntled remarks
and went off to try for snails.
“Nor’-West”: The black-tracker is not
altogether a back number in some of the N. S'.
Wales north-western districts. Three years ago a
poor half-witted young
fellow left his home be-
tween Warialda and Moree.
and wandered away into
the bush. A search party,
headed by John Hop and
a police tracker, set out
after the wanderer. The
country was rough, stony
and a great deal of it
thick with prickly-pear,
and the weather was very
dry. The tracker, however,
got on to the trail and
followed with uncanny
accuracy the meanderings
of the lost man for two
days. The sleuth pointed
out where the wanderer
had become tired and sat
down, and where he had
slept, although no sign of
a track could be seen by
the white men. The trail
eventually led to the bank
of the Gwydir, and the
stray was found drowned
in a waterhole, where he
had evidently tried to get
a drink. I knew another
police tracker in the same
district whose lubra had
a penchant for clearing out
and taking to the bush.
In spite of all the wiles
that Emily employed,
Albert never failed to track
her down, or rather up,
for she was generally
perched in a tree when found.

“Friday Island”: It was Captain Cook’s
custom always to keep two fair-copy log-books, one
of which he would bury in case the ship’s log was
lost in shipwreck. One log was buried on Possession
Island, in Endeavor Passage, near Cape York. \
good many miners have prospected for minerals on
Possession Island with indifferent success. Cook's
log will prove a nugget of another sort when it is
unearthed.

DEALER (looking at sample of chaff): “But
this chaff’s full of thistles—horses wont
eat thistles, yon know.”
COCKY: “Well, I don’t want ’em-to eat ’em.
They can use ’em as toothpicks.”
“Pink”: The wild squash-melon is fast
becoming a curse in many .parts of Australia. Hun-
dreds of acres have been rendered useless by the
weed. Yet seed of the pest is being traded from
U.S.A. as “the Australian gooseberry gourd, a new
creation in climbers.” It is catalogued as “a
rapidly growing vine, with fruit resembling gigantic
gooseberries.” You can get a small packet of the
seed for 10 cents, and the crop of trouble will cost
you a freehold in Heaven.

Macpherson
The controversy which shook the
eighteenth century to the last dregs of its
coffee-house soul as to whether James
Macpherson invented Ossian or built him
out of Ilomer or really found him in a cabin
of the Scottish Highlands left the world
too tired to bother about the final and com-
plete solution of the question. Certainly
Dr. Johnson was wrong, stupidly and
heavily wrong, in denouncing the work as
clumsy forgery; but almost equally cer-
tainly have upholders of Macpherson been
at fault in asserting the complete authen-
ticity of the translations. Ossian is the
Oisin of Ireland and Oisin is the son of
Finn ; but Finn is not Fiugal. Finn is the
lighting leader of a curious band of joyous
adventurers who are frequently caught in
the meshes of magic and whose boisterous
laughter still rings down the years: Fingal
is a sober and responsible king of Western
Scotland, with a court like that of a ruder
Arthur and a circle of knights who do
chivalrous deeds much after the fashion of
the Round Table heroes. 1 have not found
a smile in Ossian, and the magic is alto-
gether of a different brand from that met
in Ireland. In Ossian there is much of the
color of the Scottish mountains, much mist
and much reference to the spirits of the
mist. About the stories of Oisin and tin* Finn
cycle there breathes always a faint en-
chantment. and the magic takes on warm
golden color. Yet. though the two sets of
tales are evidently from the same source,
it cannot be fairly said—as some Irish
writers are too ready to say—that the
Macpherson tales are a mere watering down
and beating thin of the better Irish material.
There are things peculiar to Macpherson
that are so wonderful in their conception
as to place them abreast of anything
legendary Ireland lias to offer; and there
are little touches which seem to indicate
an antiquity greater than that of any exist-
ing or known manuscript relating to either
the Finn or Rod Branch cycle. Thus: —
A mist rose slowly from the lake. It came
in the figure of an aged man along the silent plain.
Its large limbs did not move in steps... .It came
towards Selma's hall and dissolved in a shower of
blood. The king alone beheld the sight; he fore-
saw the death of his people.
No one in the eighteenth century was likely
to invent that. Again, after the tragedy
of Carthon, slain by bis father, Clessam-
mor:
The host stood darkened around ; no voice is
on the plain. Night came, the moon from the east
looked on the mournful field ; but still they stood,
like a silent grove.
That silent, standing host grouped in awe
about the fallen heroes is a picture only a
great poet could have painted. Yet once
more:
She fell on the fallen Natlios like a wreath of
snow. Her hair spreads wide on his face. Their
blood is mixing round.
Allowing for the weak eighteenth century
choice of words of the translator, there is
a sense of great power in these passages.
Then there is the reference to the sword of
Fingal which is "dark brown” in color—a
memory of the Bronze Age—and the constant
use of the passing of "the shell.” as indi-
cating the hospitality of Selrno, which
carries the thought right back to the most
primitive banquets.
Though some manuscripts of the original
Gaelic version of the poems were published
after Macplierson’s death, it seems fairly
clear that the translator made free use of
his material and that a good deal that is
weakest in the pages is due to his attempt
to improve upon it; but making all allow-
ances, Ossian remains vital and inspiring
and with proof enough of its authenticity
to give it archaeological as well as literary
value.
The admission of- this, however, lands the
true believer in some difficult places.
Malvina is the widow of Ossian’s son Oscar;
Aideen was the widow of Oisin’s son Oscar.
Malvina lived to comfort the old, blind
Ossian in the district of Glencoe, where the
massacre happened 1500 years later; but
Aideen was buried at the llill of Ilowth.
near Dublin, where her grave is still to be
seen, nearly, if the common source of the
tales is accepted as a certainty, the Irish
setting should be the correct one, as Gaelic
settlement and culture moved from Ireland
into Scotland : but the matter is not to be
settled without some consideration of the con-
ditions of the two countries during the period
between the original making of the tales
and their re-discovery. Ireland at the
Anglo-Norman Conquest became a “tremb-
ling sod” and all her best art and literature
began to fade and wither. Fragments
—and fragments only—of the litera-
ture remain; and when it comes to
the older tales, which date back to
Pagan times, it is always to be remem-
bered that they passed through the destruc-
tive mental processes of a country reformed
by a new religious system before they took
the shape in which they have been frag*
mentarily preserved. In Scotland, on the
other hand, murder was not quite so .con-
tinuous a pastime at any period as it be-
came in Ireland under English patronage;
and poems had a better chance of preser-
vation on the lips of the people than they
had in Ireland. The chief disturbing in-
fluence in the Western Highlands was the
Norse penetration. Many Scottish clans with
apparently Gaelic names are of pure Norse
ancestry; ,and for this reason a good deal
of Norse color would naturally add itself
to the songs of a people which were only
or chiefly preserved by oral repetition.
There seems very little doubt that such
Norse color is really there, even to the
description of Cruth-Loda, who appears to
be Odin. The fair line of examination of
the two streams of legend and poetry would
seem to he the close comparison of that
which they have in common. Leave
geography out of the question altogether.
Such legends might be localised in Perth-,
shirt' and yet be essentially the same as
those told in camp by the very Gauls who
broke into Rome. The legend and not its
place is the essential matter.
Further, apart from its poetic setting, the
great value of the legendary tale is that it
gives a picture of tin- mind and customs of
a race at the time of its first telling. To get
at the real Celt as he was in his heroic days
it would seem wise to take the Irish story,
strip it of all the fantastic ornament which'
weakens the tale and then read it in the light
of the corresponding story from Scotland.
The effect is a little curious. Faint glimpses
in the Irish version suddenly open up into
a full vision of racial characteristics. Mere
hints among Maepherson’s feeble-kneed ad-
jectives blossom into large and beautiful
facts. In Irish s'tory awful barbarism is
interwoven with tin- tenderest romancein
the Scottish version all the cutting off of
hfads and unnecessary bloodshed disappears*
entirely. Why? Because Ireland witnessed
sickening barbarities at close quarters for so
long that they seemed a fair ornament for
any tale, and Western Scotland, with all its
hard fighting, did not. As late as the time
of Elizabeth every Englishman in Ireland
mangled his fallen enemy, and the Norman-
Irish nobles did*the same; so the ghastly
business found an echo in the most ancient
tales edited or re-told after the coining of the
English. Almost with certainty it may be
said that the early Celt did not practise
these purely Germanic abominations.
So Macpherson—Macpherson who was so
bitterly reviled by Dr. Johnson and s«>
largely admired by Napoleon—still lias his
uses. If lie did not find a British Homer
he did preserve a useful commentary on a
legendary literature which is both the oldest
and most fascinating in Western Europe. If
he did not set a halo of glory round the
remote past of Scotland he did add some-
thing to our knowledge of the soul of ancient
Ireland. And if lie had dreamt it or forged
it the result would have been worth while.

Labor in Journalism
The reflections of about the most experi-
enced of Labor editors :
Laborites are discovering- that the ownership and
control of Labor dailies is an excellent way of
acquiring a lot of experience at the usual price.
Adelaide Herald, Brisbane Standard and Hobart
Daily Post were all started with limited cash and
unlimited enthusiasm, the assumption of the pro-
moters being that the two sorts of capital would
keep pace with each other and meet all require-
ments. Of course, enthusiasm is as good as cash,
but only so long as it is maintained at a heat
just sufficient to readily convert it into coin.
If the enthusiasm cools off, as it has a habit of
doing, the mintage falls below zero and current
expenses have to be -met out of coin reserves which,
as a rule, don’t exist. (If the enthusiasm blazes
too furiously it melts the cash, and the same result
is achieved by a different, and, generally shorter,
route.) The three metropolitan Labor papers named
have all had, or are having, a pfetty cold time
in the absence of reserves or direct subsidies. Two
of them have managed to keep the wolves away by
passing the hat round among- their friends. The
other passed the hat also in a way, but the results
were not quite commensurate with the war-time
cost of printing paper, and the SOS was flung out
to Labor Papers) Ltd., the Sydney-controlled con-
cern which owned a big building and some machinery
but no newspaper. Not having actually started
its newspaper, Labor Papers, Ltd., had a bit of
cash on hand. With this it is endeavoring to salve
the Hobart business, but whether the wreck will be
towed safely to port remains to be seen. Heavy
weather makes it a slow job, but everybody on the
articles hopes for the best.
Ordinary business ventures whose initial capital
is mostly enthusiasm sans brains or experience can
succeed only by a run of luck. Labor dailies,
almost of necessity, can succeed only by a success-
sion of miracles. When the exalted hopes of the
multitudinous owners of the show fail to materialise,
the multitudinous owners aforesaid are apt to forget
that if hope had not been puffed high by much
initial booming, wherein they themselves joined, the
project could never have been launched. The inevit-
able result is general grouching and numerous com-
plaints about “rotten management.” But it is
doubtful if any one of the three Labor dailies under
notice lias suffered much from managerial incom-
petence. Indeed, the managers have done wonders
against severe odds. Whatever short-sightedness
has been displayed may be fairly placed to the
debit of the promoters, including the multitudinous
and now disgruntled unionists who banked on en-
thusiasm in lieu of brains or boodle, and failed to
take into proper consideration certain obvious facts.
Among these latter is the painful circumstance
that estimates of advertising revenue based on cir-
culation, even if reliable in the case of non-Labor
papers, are sheer futility in the case of papers
owned and controlled by organisations which are all
the time (naturally enough) savagely “up against”
the whole commercial system known as capitalism.
Advertisers are not so insanely prejudiced against
the views put forward in the editorial columns of
Labor papers as tt> cut off their business nose to
suit their political faith; but the bulk of them are
quite satisfied that the public they want to reach
is not the public that is fanatically interested in
Labor views. So the shrewd business man buys
ins advertising space by the column from the paper
whose views are generally subordinated to news,
while nibbling perfunctorily in single inches at the
bait offered by the Labor daily’s ad.-men. Among
the advertisers whose operations provide nine-tenths
of the ad.-revenue of Australian newspapers, the
only question considered is ad.-value: whether the
ad. is likely to reach the right people as well as
the right number of people. When Labor dailies
can satisfy advertisers on that point, the days of
shoving- the hat around among the true and growling
“comrades” will have departed.
And in this connection it may be worth earlv
consideration in “union-owned” circles as to the
exact standard of social morality, to say nothing-
of the degree of horse-sense, involved in denouncing
advertising middlemen as “parasitic upholders of
capitalism” and “useless non-producers,” while
expecting the parasites to contribute largely to the
upkeep of the concern which sets out to make the
denunciations more effective. It may be all in
strict accord with the Labor spirit, of course: or
it may be in the confidence-trick class. But what-
ever it is it ought to be carefully diagnosed and
its consistency (or otherwise) defined.
The Land of Mean dobs
You can look at the mania for exporting
the raw material and letting someone else
do the skilled work from the Scientific as
well, as the industrial side. The casual and
lighthearted way in which foreigners are and
have been allowed and even encouraged to
pick the eyes out of the scientific treasures
of Australia is amazing. In our aborigines
and in our marsupials and other “living
fossils” we possess material of the highest
possible scientific interest and value, and
probably hold the keys to great problems of
evolution and development for which a solu-
tion has been vainly sought in other parts
of the world. But things are coming to
such a pass that before long an Australian
who wants to tackle these problems in real
earnest will have to go abroad for much
of his material. Before the war German
naturalists and collectors used to run all
over the place, and were given every facility
for picking up anything of value. Some of
the finest Australian anthropological and
comparative anatomy specimens are now in
German museums. Hughes did not even
ask to have their return to us made one
of the conditions of peace, though Britain
insisted on having back a skull from East
Africa and one or two - other trifles of the
kind. Now there is likely to be an American
invasion of the same character, for the great
universities there are getting keen on our
stuff. No one would say that we ought not
to welcome Uncle’s scientists as visitors, but
because a man is your guest you don’t neces-
sarily invite him to take away the choicest
hits out of your collections. Our weak point
is that our universities and so on have
done so little real work on our peculiar
scientific problems that it looks rather like
a dog in the manger not to let someone
else have the material. The investigators
who do try to get ahead receive hardly any
recognition. In Melbourne, for instance, a
good, keen man. Dr. Colin Mackenzie, has
been doing fine work on the comparative
anatomy of the marsupials and its bearing
on some very practical and pressing medical
problems. With one or two other workers
to give him a hand, chiefly W. ,T. Owen,
formerly of the Melbourne Uni., he has
started off his own bat an Australian Insti-
tute of Anatomical Research, and published
several volumes : but there has been no offi-
cial rush to shove things forward. The
big men in science in U.S.A. and in Britain
are quite ready to help us if we help our-
selves. For instance, Professor Evans, of
California Uni., who regards the scientific
study of the Australian as one of the big
jobs of the kind to be finished-up in the
world, says that he recognises that it is
Australia’s work, and hopes that it will be
done in Australia and mainly by Austra-
lians. If Australia gets on to it. America
will gladly co-operate, he adds. But if Aus-
tralia doesn’t—-well, the TJ.S. will take it out
of our hands, that’s all.
A Satchel of Books
Mons, Ansae and Kut, is “by an M.P.”
who isn’t out for glory, for he gives no indi-
cation of his identity. Being disqualified by
insufficient eyesight lie served as an intelli-
gence officer and interpreter of Asiatic and
other languages. In these capacities he saw
a scrap of the retreat from Mons, the begin-
ning of the tragedy of Gallipoli and the
downfall of lvut-el-Amara, but not being in
the front line of events he merely gathered
up odd bits of the pageant in passing. A
small dog, however intelligent, is a poor
war correspondent, because he is an uncon-
sidered item among the boots of the march-
ing army, and sees little above its knees,
and a short-sighted interpreter is under
somewhat similar disabilities. Possibly the
diary of a one-eyed Roman non-combatant
attached to the army of Italy in 410 would
have been something like the M.P.’s account
of the retreat from Mons. Some few ex-
tracts from the Roman :

b. v the centurion blowing on a tin trumpet. Hastily
resumed the march. My only remaining toga had
disappeared in the night. Remains of cohort

corpses, broken waggons and fleeing inhabitants.

of Jupiter and boiled some lentils in my helmet.

The book of the English M.P. (not the
Roman one, which is still in MS.) is pub-
lished by Edward Arnold.
Waifs and Strays, by the late O. Henry,
is a suggestive title for a volume which,
exclusive of interesting biographical matter,
looks like the sweepings of a w.p.b. Of the
12 yarns published, only one, “The Snow
Man,” shows Henry’s genius for keeping the
reader suspended between comedy and melo-
drama until the last paragraph. His trouble
was the same defect that damaged his able
countryman, the late Ambrose Bierce, when
his stories were collected —the subtle and
often protracted effort to trap the unwary
makes it very tiring to read him in bulk.
Entertaining as he was—even fine artist—
Henry in glo'bo impresses one very much like
189 consecutive long losers by a maestro of
billiards.
The Inky Way
“Alan B.”: Talking about dialect and
slang in Lachlan Beaton says (B.
19/2/’2O) : “There is no beauty or art in
this ugly mangling of the language” (as if
the language could be chopped with an axe,
like cheese!) and “Passages, which if trans-
lated into English, would make line poetry,”
etc. To speak of language as a static thing is to
speak erroneously, for language is in a con-
dition of constant change and modification.
Dialect and slang (which is new dialect) are
English, and good English. All our lan-
guage, despite the vulgar purists, is an
accumulation of slangs, and I deny that either
it or they are ugly. The mind that sees
inherent ugliness in words like “bloke” and
“donah” is diseased. The only ugliness is
the ugliness of association, an ephemeral
thing which will soon disappear, but which,
as Dennis shows, has its own poetry. Dialect
Poetry, in preserving the strange wild beauty
of slang, has done a service to literature.
There is something doing in Australians
these days. A few years ago you could get
a very decent copy of the first (1759) coi-
tion of Phillip’s “Voyage to Botany Bay"
for £2 or £2 10s.. and a copy of Hunter’s
“Journal” 'for even less. But the other day
a Melbourne bookseller had the two snapped
up by a collector for £lO as soon as he put
them on offer. As for really good old MS.
stuff, there is a rising market for it all the
time, especially in Sydney.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
.According to a Melbourne paper, a man
was arrested at Prahran the other day for having
“No visible means of sport.” A thoroughly Aus-
tralian offence, anyway.
* * * *
“Silas”: llow is this for a sanguine man?
The secretary of one small sports club in this city
unde, takes commissions for the procuration of
tickets in Tatt.’s, and Moody had become a most
extravagant dealer. He seemed to be putting every
dollar he could scrape together into tickets in one
sweep or another. “Going it, aren’t you?’’ said the
secretary, the other day. Moody nodded. “You
bet!” he said. “Who wouldn’t? Have you heard
of the near thing I had to a first a month ago?—
a lovely six thousand.” “I didn’t hear. Were you
one number off?” “No,” he said, “but it was pulled
off by the fellow next door but one.”

Four fishermen got a big catch at Port
Chalmers (M.L.) recently, landing a shark 19ft. long
and 17ft. at the equator. After two harpoons had
carried away, a third held, and then, towing a 80ft.
launch, the brute fought for over four hours.
A point in cricket ruling has been raised
by the action of a dog in Albert Park (Vic.). A
batsman snicked a ball, and a chance retriever butted
in and caught it in his mouth. A fieldsman
took the ball from the dog'. The ball had not
touched the ground. Query: Was the batsman out?
The umpire said he wasn’t, on the assumption that
the dog was the ground within the meaning of the
Act.

S. Aus. golfers find themselves in the odd
position of having to decline to hold the Australian
championship in their turn. They say the Seaton
course is equal to anything anywhere, but the club-
house accommodation was found insufficient in 1910
for a really big gathering, and has not been brought
up to date, mainly owing to the war. During the
coming year everything is to be improved so as to
take on all-comers.

“15-30”: Melbourne Grammar seems to
have produced most of the front rankers in Vic-
torian tennis. Brookes, Wood, Heath, Wertheim and
Rainey are all old boys. Grammar's rival, Scotch
College, nurtured G. L. Patterson, and Geelong
College is responsible for J. B. Hawkes. Next to
Brookes, Rainey is the patriarch of the crowd. He
was Grammar’s captain in cricket at the end of
last century, and must be now on the edge of
the forties. Though he has only dropped cricket
for tennis in recent years, lie owns all the high-
powered swipes and can lure all but the best net-
players to "the base line with his sure and exas-
perating lobs. He habitually appears on the courts
in knickerbockers.

“0.K.” : Out of personal experience at
the recent V.R.C. meeting- I speak feelingly re
the cast-iron cheek of the licensed bookmaker who
is allotted a numbered stand in the paddock at
Flemington. The stands are not ranged according
to numbers, as at Caulfield ; therefore any occasional
punter, unacquainted with the countenance of the
man who pouches his money, can only locate him by
means of the iron label attached to the bar of his
betting place, whereon his name appears. The
discovering of this name is trouble enough when the
paddock is crowded, but my trouble on Australian
Cup day was that, after I had sighted the stand
of the Sydney bookmaker who laid me eight half-
notes to one about Macadam for the Australian Cup
before the racing commenced, I had to whistle for
my money. His stand was vacant. From where he
laid me the odds some two hours earlier he had
vanished like a dream, nor could I have sworn that
it was the place but for the tell-tale iron label which
now marked the gentleman’s absence. A shopkeeper
who changes his stand leaves a notification behind him
of his new address, but a removed bookmaker doesn’t
paste a paper on his late stand in Flemington pad-
dock, stating where he may be found by clients who
have money to collect. I paid several visits to the
deserted stand during the afternoon, and the name
was always in the old place, but the bookmaker
was never there. As a matter of fact, he was else-
where in the paddock, occupying the stand of another
absentee. And it seems he was within his licensed rights
in changing his position thus casually. On a subse-
quent day I found the gentleman at his new place
of business, and without a word 1 presented my
ticket, which was duly honored without the least
apology for the annoyance and inconvenience I had
been put' to. The correctness of my pasteboard was
certified to by a clerk who took a crumpled piece of
paper from his pocket and referred to several
numbers, so I assumed I was not the only creditor
who had been unpaid on the previous day.
The club which allots a bookmaker a certain stand
at the beginning of a meeting should at least require
him to remain in occupation until the close. The
shifting bookmaker is one more powerful argument
in favor of the totalisator. The tote never changes
its location between the time it receives and the
time payment comes due.
“Wessel”: Up at Darwin (N.T.) the
sports play football (Australian rules, or as near
to them as they can remember) in the summer
and cricket in the winter. The summer is the
wet season, and football is easily the best game
when the ground is under water, while during the
Seven months’ winter and spring there is no danger
of more than a spoonful or two of rain. About
the best Darwin footballer is the half-caste son
of old Joe Cooper, the Melville Island buffalo-hunter,
who strips for the meatworks team. He learnt
his football at Prince Alfred College (Adelaide),
and is a very smart runner and Swimmer. The
barracking is done in English, Australian, Chinese,
Greek, Malay, Spanish, Nigger and Blanky.
* * * *
“Pond”: Now the duck season is in full
swing, I want to ask The Bulletin’s professor of
etiquette why gentlemen carry wild duck through the
town on a string, whereas if you asked them to carry
an ordinary dead farmyard duck along the same
street you would be regarded as an ignorant, impu-
dent fellow. Why is it that ordinary ducks and
chooks are so de trop and wild ducks so much the
other thing, don't y’know? Is there something dis-
creditable about the tame chook that doesn’t attach
to the other; and, if so, please what is it ?

HIS OF THE FLESH,
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
He was the new star boarder. We
Soon ascertained his name,
The kind of cigarettes which he
Dispensed, and that an ailing knee
Had made him slightly lame.
We swept the corners of his life
And found that he had left his wife.
We drank his whisky, helped to rid
His room of its few books,
And then we asked him what he did
To earn a crust—since nought is hid
Midst friends. He met our looks
With haughty smile and tilted head.
“I treat the poor insane,” he said.
The doctor was our joy. lie gave
Us hints on keeping young. . . .
On Saturday I went with Dave
To Flemington, where bookies rave,
And there with brazen tongue
We found him practising. ’Twas plain
We were his patients—the insane!

OF DR. MORSE’S INDIAN MOOT PILLS.
The consistent efficacy of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills is the real reason for the continued
and ever-increasing demand for this remedy. Letters from all parts of Australia and New
Zealand in praise of these pills are continually being received by the Proprietors. Space
will not permit reproducing anything like the number received, but the few here printed
go to show the widespread popularity of this remedy. For every letter published there are
thousands of people who will speak in similar terms.
ARMIDALE.
Mrs. M. Fitzgerald. Barney Street,
Armidale, N.S.W., writes:—
“It is interesting to record of the good
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have done
me. I was a martyr to biliousness and sick
headaches for some time before taking' your
pills. After taking a dose of the pills I can
say they are wlnit they are claimed to be, as
they relieved me of the above complaints. I
speak of your pills as an unrivalled and
a most reliable medicine for banishing the
above ailments. I recommend these pills
to such sufferers, as I have found them
to be an undoubtedly good corrective
medicine.”
GISBORNE.
Mrs. Mary McKinley, 303 Aberdeen
Road, Gisborne, N.Z., writes:
“I am a-great believer in Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, having derived much
benefit from their use in combating indi-
gestion and constipation. I was formerly
a martyr in suffering from indigestion,
and accordingly now recommend these
pills to my friends and acquaintances.”
WHANGAREI.
Mrs. Caroline Conaghan, Cameron
Street, Whangarei, N.Z., writes:
“I can assert that Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are a useful medicine for cor-
recting that tired feeling or languor and
fatigue arising from a sluggish liver. I
am a resident of Whangarei, nineteen
years and mother of five children.”
HOWARD.
Mrs. E. Paines. William Street,
Howard, Q’land, writes:
“To anyone who values good health, I
would recommend Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills every time. I have used this
remedy as occasion required for a good
many years, with the very best results,
having enjoyed good health all the time.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills not only
regulate the system, but tone it up as
well, and by increasing the pleasure of
existence, make life really worth while.”
KALGOORLIE
Nurse M. G. Bourke, 100 Collins
Street, Piccadilly, Kalsjoorlie, W.A.,
writes:—-
“I can certify that Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are an excellent medicine for
rectifying constipation. Occasionally I
have recommended them to my patients
in my capacity of certified maternity
nurse. I have been twenty-four years in
Ivalgoorlie, practising throughout that
period as medical, surgical and maternity
nurse.”
NORTH PERTH.
Mrs. Bessie Murphy. 3 Randall Street,
North Perth, W.A., writes:
“I can say Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are an unequalled and most reliable
medicine for banishing kidney trouble, of
which I was a victim. I suffered from
severe pains in the back and for days
could not do any work. After I had
taken a dose of your pills I soon felt the
pains going away. I continued taking
doses till I had emptied one bottle, and
since then I have not had a recurrence.
I strongly recommend these pills to like
sufferers.”
RUTHERGLEN.
Mr. Francis C. Lott, Brown’s Plains,
Rutherglen, Vic., writes:
“I have used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills for many years. Whenever I suffer
with slight bilious attacks these pills
always rectify my health, and I can per-
sonally recommend them as a genuine
‘Liver Pill.’ My wife also finds them
useful occasionally. During the past
fourteen years I have been employed on
the Victorian Railways, and am well
and favorably known.”
ENFIELD.
Mrs. M. H. Bowden, Great North
Road, Enfield, S.A., writes:—
“At times I was troubled with eostive-
ness, and tried Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. I found these pills very mild in
their action; they do not gripe like so
many other so-called remedies.”
KENSINGTON.
Mrs. M. E. Unsworth, 11 Regent
Street, Kensington, S.A., writes:
“I find excellent results from the use
of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills in ward-
ing off biliousness. I have suffered many
bilious attacks and tried several medi-
cines, but none equal to your remedy for
this ailment.”
HINDMARSH.
Mrs. Marion Smith, 15 Robert Street,
Hindmarsh, S.A., writes:
“Sometime ago I was a sufferer from
indigestion, and took a course of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills on the persua-
sion of a friend. I am pleased to relate
that I derived much benefit from this
remedy, and can now recommend them
accordingly to any similar sufferers.”
PARKSIDE.
Mrs. Adelaide Fry, 33 Victoria Street,
Parkside, S.A.:—
“I was a great martyr to rheumatics
in I.ongreach, Q., and at times could not
move from my bed. My mother was a
great believer in Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills, and through her instrumentality I
took your remedy and found them relieve
my suffering always. I now take them
occasionally and my state of health is
usually very good.”
UNLEY.
Mrs. Eva May Rowney, 30 Charles
Street, Unley, S.A.: —
“My mother first induced me to use
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as I was a
great sufferer from biliousness. I usually
find that a dose of pills wards off any
recurrence of bilious disorder. I am an
old resident of Bordertown and mother of
five children.”
WANGANUI.
Mrs. Catherine Nyon, 51 Harrison
Street, Wanganui, N.Z., writes:
“I had been suffering from kidney
trouble for some years, when I decided to
give Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills a trial.
I can testify to their efficacy in my case,
and I recommend them to my friends.”
HOBART.
Mrs. Douglas Coombe, 33 Brisbane
Street, Hobart, Tas., writes:
“I was a great sufferer with rheuma-
tism for a period of two or three years,
and was under the doctor for some time,
but this complaint proved most persistent,
and consequently I had found little relief
when I came in contact with one of your
pamphlets and decided to give Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills a trial. I then under-
went a course of your pills and found in
less than six months that I was relieved
of the rheumatism altogether, and I can-
not recommend this medicine too highly,
and frequently praise the pills to my
friends and acquaintances. My husband
also finds them beneficial, and they provide
our family medicine.”
ZEEHAN.
Mrs. W. Wallace, Grubb’s Train
Road, Zeehan, Tas., writes: —
“I can assert that Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are beneficiaj for the relief
of biliousness, and can personally recom-
mend them to similar sufferers. 1 am an
old resident of this township and mother
of two children.”
ULVERSTONE.
Nurse Janet Cameron, West river-
stone. Tas., writes:—
“I desire to certify to the efficacy of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills as a genu-
ine remedy for the relief of indigestion.
Many years ago I first tried this medicine,
and have frequently recommended Dr.
Molise's Indian Root Pills also as a laxa-
tive to my patients in my capacity as a
maternity nurse, where I followed this
profession for many years past. I was
trained in Melbourne, Victoria.”
SOUTH GORE.
Mrs. Edith E. Johnston, Redmond
Street, South Gore, N.Z., writes:
• “I have a very good opinion of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills for relieving
indigestion and constipation. I was re-
commended by a friend to take these pills
and can now accordingly speak of their
merit.”
NOWRA.
Mrs. Ponce. Berry Street, Nowra,
N.S.W., writes: —
“It is a pleasure to write of the good
results I have obtained from the use of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for keeping
the liver in good order. I suffered from
severe headaches and a sluggish liver, but
I now take a dose of your pills twice a
week, therefore I never get a recurrence
of my old complaint. I am a great be-
liever in your pills. I also recommend
them to such sufferers.”
south”wagga.
Mrs. PowCna Gvav. Lewisham, South
Wagga, N.S.W., writes:
“I followed a sedentary life as a school-
teacher for twenty-five years and became
a victim to constipation. At that period
I was a resident of Western Australia and
occasionally visited Perth, W.A., where
I consulted a doctor. He recommended
my using Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
as I was a relieving teacher and at times
far removed from the chance of obtaining
medical advice—he advised my always
keeping Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills on
hand. I cannot speak tbo highly of this
remedy, and still find them useful with
myself, husband and family.”
LEICHHARDT.
Mr. John Beeby. 173 Flood Street,
Leichhardt, N.S.W., writes:—
“After ten years of perpetual suffering
from kidney and liver complaints, and
during that time trying medicines of all
kinds without relief, my wife advised me
in December. 1917, to try Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. I took her advice, and
in February, 1918, my pains left me, and
up till now I have been free from pain,
through the constant use of the pills
every third day. I am a carpenter and
joiner. I have for years worked in pain,
when many would have given up in de-
spair. I can only give credit to Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills for my splendid
state of health to-day. If you care to,
you may publish this with a view of help-
ing some fellow-workman who may suffer
as i did. I always found the pills did
their work best if I took them going
to bed.”
YEA^
Mrs. Harriet May Wilson, High
Street, Yea, Vic., writes:
“I was first recommended to try Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills for the relief
of indigestion. I used to suffer a terrible
lot with indigestion and a weak back. I
tried other remedies, but found Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills act in a much
better manner in my case than any other
remedy. I am a native of this district,
and you may use this testimony in what-
ever manner desired for publicity.”
BEECHWORTH.
Mr. Frank Snow, Atkinson Road,
Beechworth, Vic., writes:—
“Some two years ago T had occasion to
use Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as I
was then suffering from kidney trouble.
I am pleased to say that I found much
relief from your remedy, and conse-
quently can now recommend them to like
sufferers.”
LAUNCESTON.
Mr. A. Phillips, 3 Goodwin Street,
Inveresk, Launceston, Tas., writes:
"I have used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills for the relief of kidney trouble and
can recommend these pills to like sufferers,
having personally found most beneficial
results from their use. The claim made
for Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills being
an efficacious remedy I can substantiate
personally.”
MILTON.
Mrs. Catherine Davies, Mcl)ou,t*al
Street, Milton, Q’land, writes:
“A chemist recommended me to try
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for severe
sick headaches and pains in the back. I
would feel quite dizzy, with the head
throbbing so, just as if I was going to
fall forward. My back would ache so
that I could hardly stoop. These attacks
would last about a couple of days at a
time. Sometimes I would have to take
to my bed with them, for I couldn’t hold
up any longer. I could not fancy any-
thing to eat, and would be so qualmish.
It is only a few months since I started
the course, taking two pills each night;
it is wonderful the good they have done
me. I shall always keep them by me
and speak of them with gratitude.”
WANGARATTA.
Mrs. W. Boyle, Wilson Road, Wan-
garatta, Vic., writes:—
“I wish to state that I have found Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills act in a mild
and satisfactory manner for the relief
of constipation. Occasionally they also
prove useful, with my family when costive.
I am a native o£ this township and life-
long resident.”
ROCKHAMPTON.
Mrs. E. F. Bates, 396 East Street,
Rockhampton, Q’land, writes:
“It is now eleven years since I was
cured of chronic indigestion by using Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. My doctor
gave my case up as incurable and said he
could do no more for me. After every
meal I used to have a hot burning sensa-
tion at the pit of the stomach, with fer-
mentation of food and flatulence; and I
was also troubled with constipation. I
suffered from great depression of spirits,
and was in sneh a low condition that I
could hardly do any work, or take inter-
est in anything, and life was not worth
living. In this extremity I was advised
to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and
as I felt such great relief from the very
first dose, I was encouraged to give this
medicine a fair trial, and as my health
began to improve with almost every dose
I took, I continued with this medicine for
several weeks, at the end of which, to my
great surprise and joy, I found myself
completely cured —and I have remained
cured. I continued to use this medicine
occasionally for regulating the system and
do so still.”
NAPIER.
Mrs. M. M. Tanner, 7 Edwardes
Street, Napier, S., N.Z., writes:
“It is gratifying to be able to state
that I have derived much benefit from the
use of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
being a sufferer from indigestion.”
are a purely vegetable preparation. They are not advertised as a cure-all, but as a corrective for everyday ills. They purify
the blood, cleanse the stomach, put life into the liver, stimulate the kidneys to perform their proper function, and will prevent
many of the ailments so common if taken occasionally to keep the system in proper working order. In thousands of homes
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are the Sole Family Remedy for all general complaints.

A. C. Fairhall, who has fairly earned the
job, succeeds Hosken as solicitor in charge
of criminal business in the Vic. Law Depart-
ment. and P. J. Conlon. known all over the
State as a relieving Clerk of Courts, has
been made a P.M. in place of Jack Penne-
father, who died up Beecliworth way
recently.
Walter William Crockford, N. S. Wales's
new sheriff, was born in England in 186.1. and
from 1881 to 1887, when he came to Sydney,
he was stockbroking and banking in London.
He joined the sheriff’s department in 1892.
and was the Public Service Board’s first
accountant (1896). He has been Under-
Sheriff since 11102.
“Smike”: A Melbourne firm that lately cut
up an estate into soldiers’ blocks and named
the streets after Allied generals ought to
have been told not to remember General
Cadorna. After the Italian disaster it be-
came archaic to describe a disaster as “cornin’
a gutser.” In fashionable Digger circles it
was “gettin’ a Cadorna” or “cornin’ a Cad-
orna,’’ and remained like that until the end
df the war.
“0.L.”: There is no timber-combine in
Victoria, brethren. Still, there are indica-
tions that a certain understanding exists
among big firms. If a man with a “home
industry” makes, say, sideboards, lie can get
all the timber he wants and sell his output
just as low as he likes. The big firms don t
make sideboards. But if the home-industry
person makes doors or window-frames and
goes out after business, there is no more
material for him until he signs an agree-
ment not to sell below a certain rate. You
see, the large timber-people make doors and
window-frames.
Arthur Graham Saddington, who succeeds
C. 11. Walsh as N. S. Wales Prothonotary,
was born at Balmain and graduated at the
University in ISB7. lie annexed a Gent
One’s ticket, and was in private practice
until he became the Supreme Court’s chief
clerk. In 1902 he helped D. G. (now
Justice) Ferguson to consolidate the
Supreme Court rules; with Blacket, K.C.,
he fixed up the Criminal Appeal Court rules ;
he set the Prize Court going during the
war, and lately let loose a book about the
taxation of Costs between Parties. Outside
the law-mill he has been cricketer, footballer,
yachtsman and tenniseer. The veteran
Walsh, having reached the retiring age and
been pushed out, has gone to the Bar, and
held his first brief recently at Lithgow.
The Methodist Conference in Adelaide has
been discussing beggarly stipends. The mini-
mum wage for hired “local preachers” or
“home missionaries” —£115 for single men
and £l3O for married—was fixed nearly 10
years ago, when things were very different,
and a lot of men with families now have a
humiliating time. Conference had not
much difficulty in making it £l2O and £175.
There was a strong feeling that if Methodist
ministers (that’s the trained and ordained
preachers) could not get the £260 said to be
paid in N. S. Wales, Conference should try
to work up to £250 for married men and £220
for single. Judging by these figures Con-
ference evidently reckons either that a
married parson’s youngsters—generally a
multitude —are very cheaply fed or clothed,
or that an unmarried parson is entitled to a
pretty good time.
Captain Harry J. Butler. Adelaide’s
aviator, has discovered that lie’s a most
popular man at the Adelaide “Stockade” or
labor prison. The flier makes frequent trips
in the vicinity of Dry Creek, and often gives
the caged birds a treat when doing stunts.
Some months back the canaries sent a letter
of thanks to him, and the other day one of
their number who had just been released was
commissioned to personally convey the
thanks of the prisoners. The messenger, a
middle-aged man, was quite emotional over
the job, but he made his speech. .“Captain,”
he said, “I. have seen you fly over almost
daily for the last six months. P’r’aps you
don’t know how much you lightened our
burden. From behind the iron bars human
beings watch eagerly for your ascent. 1
came to thank you for myself and fellow-
creatures out in that hole.”
“Smijthh”: He’s had a fair go now, so
I’ll let it out. Travelling by a suburban
train about 6 p.m. on the Saturday Ross
Smith arrived in Sydney a seedy-looking
individual got in and sat next me. He’d
had a pot or two, and was happy. “ ’Sense
me,” he said, “but it’s a bit of a joke ! My
brother was out at South Head this morn-
ing selling photo postcards of Ross Smith
flying through the ’ends at a bob each.
There was such a rush on ’em he put ’em
up to two bob. and with two chaps working
for ’im ’e made over fourteen quid in an
hour. This afternoon e’ was at Mascot and
I’ve been canvassing out this way.” While
I grunted my indifference he leaned over
and hoarsely whispered: “The joke is ’e’s
been making those p.c.’s for the last
three weeks. It was a photo of Hart’s ’plane
but nobody noticed. Funny, ain’t it? Me
brother’s just back from the war—only got
one leg, but ’is brains are all right.”
“Blanc” : J ust after Byng’s Cambrai push
in December, 1917, Fritz broke through
towards Peronne. The 4th Div. Diggers had
just completed a week of their oft-promised
three months’ rest when they received 12
hours’ notice to get up to the lines again. De-
training in the snow among the canals at
midnight, the mob pushed along the frozen
roads towards Fritz. Among the many
signs of a hasty British retirement was an
odoriferous billy-goat mascot —all that was
left of a broken Welsh battalion. He refused
every invitation to imshee, and insisted
on marching at the head of a platoon. No-
body was in the humor to put up with him
until a 13th Bat. “loot” asked his lot how
••Billy” would eat as a change from “bully."
Immediately that goat became the pet of the
platoon. Arriving at Moislains, he was
tethered near the company cooker, until one
day when we returned in a blizz.ard from a
row with Fritz, ready to eat even our ground
.sheets, we found Taffy's mascot absent. No
one asked any questions, but that his dis-
appearance was appreciated was shown by
the return of the mess-orderlies to the cook-
house to ask of the cook’s off-sider “Any
buckshee, Darkie?”

MOTOR CAR
A more remarkable recognition of merit on the part
of the public it would be difficult to conceive.
Every increase in production is comfortably
absorbed in an increased market.
The works in which the car is produced have grown
until they are almost a city in themselves.
But when the satisfaction of the market seems to
be in sight, the horizon widens and draws itself
still further away.
The petrol consumption is unusually low.
The tyre mileage is unusually high.

Courtesy and Considera-
tion for Customers
A Valuable Asset in
Selling.
There never was a time in the history of
business when courtesy and consideration
for the customer was as valuable as it is
at this moment.
The reason for this enhanced value is
that courtesy lias become so uncommon that
it stands out by way of contrast with pre-
valent practice. Independence and insolence
have become the order of the day.
"Take it or leave it.” is the implied or
spoken attitude of most men who have
something to sell.
The general result is that the buyer and
tlie seller have almost changed places in the
manner of their approach. It is the buyer
who now comes forward with humility—the
seller who assumes the air of one conferring
a favor. While I am not singling out any
particular business to bear the brunt of this
indictment, neither am I inclined to make
exceptions.
Both private and public amenities have
bioken down under the rasping influence of
war and after-war conditions. Swollen tills
and pocket-books have resulted in swollen
heads and insolent manners.
Ihe merchant with a modicum of linger-
ing commonsense will avoid this habit as
though it were a pestilence. The day of
reckoning between the seller and the buyer
cannot be indefinitely delayed. It is bound
t° come within a few years. When it does
come, the man with something to sell who
has wantonly affronted his patronage over
a long period will be paid back with interest
tor that period of self-indulgence.
The wise merchant interprets the func-
tion of the seller with absolute accuracy,
delicately or otherwise according to the
degree of his personal gifts of salesmanship,
lie clearly expresses to the customer the
idea that his interests are paramount.
Such merchants analyse the type of trade
to Y h J ch they appeal, and base the degree
<>t deference which they display upon the
several class susceptibilities.
No wise sales manager or salesman will
he too proud to learn from this lesson that
it is not necessary to be obsequious or sub-
servient-—hut it indutiably does pay, not
merely in the immediate instance but in the
long run, to be decently polite.
The entire business structure is permeated
at this moment with an impudence which
would warrant many a harassed customer
in boxing the ears of the whipper-snapper
maie or female, who indulges in this out-
rageous license.
The salesman of naturally gentle manners,
rairly glistens by way of contrast—and this
contrast could and should be translated into
the doliars and cents which are paid to him
ut the end of the week.
Even though they be minus the skill of a
more surly sales-person, their value is greater
at this juncture to the house that employs
them. Ihe very plain, clear moral which
this suggests is equally applicable to all
branches of business, from the sale of motor
cars to the sale of sugar.
. The evil referred to has struck its roots
into all phases of modern industry. It,' is
high time for the intelligent sales manager
to take stock of himself and of his organisa-
tion, and root out an abuse which might
well bear poisonous fruits for an indefinite
time to come.

John Bowser, ex-Premier of Vie., is in-
clined to join the Farmers’ Union, but has
not quite made up his mind. He has been
pondering over the matter off and on for
months. Cook’s victory in Indi (of which
Wangaratta forms part) is calculated to
hasten his decision.
Sydney Water and Sewerage Board is of
opinion that the estimates made of the city’s
population since the census of 1911 are
below the mark. Judging by the number of
people it waters it reckons that Greater
Sydney holds a million inhabitants. If that
is" so the One Big City people have congested
better than they knew.
Hannah. M.L.A., is head and front of a
new combination in Melbourne called "W ake
Up, Victoria !” The object of the body is
to stir up the people to a livelier interest
in public affairs. It is not popular with
some members, who realise that if the people
really wake up their first act will be to put
many of the politicians to sleep.
Not very sure of their own intrinsic merits,
apparently, the minor S. Aus. Courts, even
those which deal with purely commercial
matters, have lately either adopted or
sumed the wearing of wigs and gowns. The
Insolvency Court has reintroduced the prac-
tice ; and the Industrial Court, where in
particular it ought to have no place, has
established it.
An Adelaide lodger brought in somebody
elad's wife and immediately cut her head
nearly off, afterwards dealing with himself
just as effectually. It was a messy and un-
pleasant matter, but the report of it was
brightened by one of those touches which
make novelists famous. It was just the
heartfelt remark of the landlord : “Why on
earth must he bring her here to do it?”
The late Professor Stirling's work in con-
nection with Adelaide Museum, of which
he was curator for many years, is to be
commemorated in two ways. The gallery
of ethnology and native curios, on which
lie was the admitted authority, has been
named the Stirling Gallery : and in it is to
he placed a stone and bronze memorial bear-
ing his portrait. The design is prepared by
G. A. Barnes, curator of the Art Gallery.
Cecil Madigan, of Adelaide, has done more
travelling than most Australians. He had
just won a Rhodes scholarship when he took
the chance to go with Mawson to the Antarc-
tic. On his return the war broke out, and
again he got leave to suspend the scholar-
ship. Since the Armistice he has given
Oxford a chance at last, and in quick time
lie took an honors degree in geology. Now
this pursuit takes him to Khartoum, where
the Soudan Government has given him a
good appointment.
The Argus, being'in the place,, where it is
demanded of conscience to speak the ’struth,
has shocked Melbourne City Council. Con-
cerning the late Major-Gen. Burston. who
died last week. Gran’ma stated that the de-
ceased Gallipolean “took no part in politics,
but entered the City Council in 1900 and. . ..
retired in 1912.” Politics, in the beginning
of things, were “the affairs of the city.”
Seemingly Gran’ma recognises that the
M.C.C. nowadays is less concerned with the
actual politics which are its appointed job
than with the frills which surround it.
From a man whose job takes him into
many offices: —
Nowadays 15s. a week is quite the usual thing for
a she-typist, and thousands of young women go daily
to the city to fiddle away their time in stuffy offices
at this dead-end calling. The discrepancy to-day
between the selling price of a shirt and the cost of
its component parts is immense, and it is largely
owing to the difficulty of getting girls able and will-
ing to do the necessary putting-together at £2 a
week and upwards. A severe pruning of the typing-
teachers’ activities might turn the attention of the
prospective 15-bob clerk to higher things, and give
them and their fellow wage-earners cheaper and
better clothes at the same time.
“Jake B.”: The stout effort which Col.
Van Ryneveld put up in his flight to the
Cape will not surprise anyone acquainted
with his activities in France. Once he
attacked three Hun ’planes single-handed,
and after shooting one down received an
issue of three bullets in the chest and two
scalp wounds. With this extra weight
aboard he made a perfect landing on Bailleul
aerodrome. In 1913 he represented ft. Africa
in Rugby football, and another member of the
family was in the Springbok X V which
achieved fame in England. After the Armis-
tice he was given the job of organising a S.
African Flying Corps, and was engaged on
this up to the time of embarking on his
recent enterprise.
A pioneer’s passing :
Died lately at Bega (N.S.W.), “Billy” Bartley,
79, the first white man born in those parts. His
dad was sent there by Andrew Badgery, of Bong
Bong, in charge of cattle in 1827, and pitched camp
at Marragaburra. On this lonely station he spent
11 or 15 venturesome years. On one occasion his
hut-keeper and only companion was murdered by the
blacks, and but for Bartley’s fleet-footedness he would
have been butchered too. During his term of office
Governor Bourke, when on an inland trip, came across
Bartley. The sympathetic Ex., after hearing Bartley’s
life-story, told him to apply for a land grant and
he (Bourke) would see that it was fixed; but the
pioneer made no claim. Anything less than £20,000
wouldn’t purchase much of that part of the cow-
country now. “Bega Joe,” as he was afterwards
known, married Miss Coghlan, and the just-dead
Billy was their first child.
The cable has reported what looks like
the strangest tale of the war, but isn’t.
A Ukrainian peasant, who had been a war
prisoner for three years, returning to find
that his parents believed him dead, went
home incognito; and the old people, with
their cupidity aroused by the sight of a
roll of notes in his possession, murdered him
before they became aware of his identity.
The stranger tale was that of a man who
returned to England with a face disfigured
from fighting on Gallipoli. He posed as
another man and was accepted by the other
man’s friends and even by the other man’s
wife. The imposition only ended when his
own wife traced him. In subsequent court
proceedings the wife was full of scornful
disbelief about the sincerity of the other
woman who claimed that she could not tell
the difference between an impostor and her
own husband ; but she and her friends stuck
to the story that they had all been deceived.

Tablets -
Mother-look at his tongue!
Give him Chamberlain’s Tablets, quick!
He wont eat ? Then, don’t
scold !! See if his tongue is coated
white, breath feverish. If so his
stomach is out of order.
A stomach out of order does not
sound much. Yet it makes a child
mighty miserable. It makes him
bilious, his appetite poor and vari-
able. He is fretful and nattering,
restless in his sleep.
A few doses of Chamberlain’s
Tablets will quickly set him right.
They will clear the sour stomach.
This will sweeten the breath and
create a healthy appetite.
They promote the flow of gastric
juices, thereby inducing good
digestion.
The most valuable thing to have
in your medicine chest is a box of
Jor the Stomach o Liver
Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
idtal to young anc| oid. The great danger in
:his disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges ti e stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when ‘his remedy is at hand all danger
pray be avoided.
Be Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanen*
relief.

“Ah! Cark Me Sole.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SUNDAY night in Sydney is not a
heremetically sealed dungeon promen-
aded by Polar bears for eight months
of the year as Melbourne is, but it is dull
enough to drive some people to church.
Those who abandon church take up
Theosophy, Christian Adventurism, or some
other ’ology which mostly consists in your-
self knowing more than you can find out;
or lectures on “Free Love—Spirit Mates —
Affinities,” which are all right in the
abstract, but in the concrete make 'the
divorce Judges moralise and pretend they
never heard of such wickedness before. There
are other lectures advertised every week
on “Spirit Control and Guidance,” "Tele-
pathy-” and “Do the Dead Eat Pork?” and
these are mixed up with sex and the passing
round of the hat. This talk of spirit-mates
and sex-affinities does little harm, and when
surfing is out of season the waste of time
matters not; though generally every woman
knows that, while being husband and wife in
the sight of God may be all very romantic and
beautiful, it is much more important to be
husband and wife in the sight of the Registrar.
One Sunday night of last Sydney winter,
being at a loose end, I, at the instigation of
two ladies who insisted on knowing all about
the future here and immediately, climbed
worn and crepitating stairs to a tawdry, gas-
lit hall in Castlereagli-street. There was the
usual hard-faced woman in possession of
the platform and her companions in crime—
the usual silver-haired scoundrel with the
gift of the gab and a tremendous contempt
for anything vaguely related to fact. The
full parson is a fearsome thing for intelli-
gence, but the ex-parson is seven devils. He
comes away from his parsonry equipped
with all the “vouchsafes” and “peradven-
tures” that are the daily phrases of the life,
and. like the nigger who has been taught
all the bad white man’s tricks, all the more
dangerous for the knowledge.
The hard-faced woman resented us on
sight ; the spirits, maybe, told her we were
enemies. She particularly disliked the two
ladies I escorted. Very vital brunettes they
were—one plump and the other whipcord
from the surf, and they giggled at everything.
The hard-faced woman talked at them:
“We. don’t want people cornin’ ’ere inter-
ruptin’ sacred services. This is hour church
just as much as any other church.”
I commanded the gigglers to stop, and the
hard-faced woman turned her attention to me,
“An’ we don’t want fat detecatives coinin’
’ere. tho’ we have nothink to ’ide. If it’s
forchin’-tellin’ to comfort the weak an’ ’elp
the weary-arted, then we are fore bin’-teller#.
If it’s forchin’-tellin’ to tell poor people of
a brighter future an’ ’appier days, we are
forchin’-tellers, an’ the Law can deal with
us. But don’t come ’ere sneakin’ like deteca-
tives; or” (a new thought striking her)
“like dirty reporters orf the papers, cornin’
’ere for the Sydney Mornix’ ’Ehald an’
Trootii. We will now sing ’ymn number
187, *Ah! Cark Me Sole’ —you all know
the malady.”
My two giggled violently, and we arose
with the others to sing. The hard-faced
woman led off with the atrocity—
Ah! Cark me sole,
Angelic voices ringin’.
“She means ‘Hark, hark, my soul,’ said
the plump brunette, and she and the whip-
cord one were crazy with laughter that was
covered by the. roaring. They interrupted
the silvery-haired fraud’s address so that I
missed a great deal of the eloquence.
“My deah friends,” he said, as benevolently
as a cat within claw distance of the mouse,
“our know-ledge of the spirit-world is not
easily attained, nor easily to be upset by
scoffahs. Scoffahs have scoffed at all the
great spiritual discovah-ries of all the ages.
Let the scoffahs continue to —ah—scoff.”
“Ah! Cark me sole,” said the plump
brunette, and took the whipcord one with
her to Giggleville.
“We have as fellow-believahs the greatest
scientists and thinkahs of the world. Sir
Oliver Lodge, Sir William Crookes, W. T.
Stead and the fathah of the great John
Wesley have all affirmed themselves be-
lievahs.” (By now every charlatan of the
game is using Conan Doyle as another aid to
easy , money.) “And so we are* not to be
turned from our belief in the spirit-world
because of such people as unbelievahs.”
“Ah! Cark me sole,” said the whipcord
one’ and went bff again.
I whispered them to be discreet, threatening
to take them outside, but they merely retorted,
“Ah! Cark me sole,” and giggled again; so
that at last I collected my two and escaped.
Poor old human nature must believe in
something, get comfort and distraction out
of something, worship Something. Then let
it believe in the world we know and the
regeneration of it, believe in human nature
and its betterment and worship nature or
some creature of it, taking the ingratitude
that must come from worship of anything
as being merely a discount of the sum of
happiness, the vinegar of the ox.vmel that
yet has its little honey. There may be
another life—a life of continuity of con-
sciousness, that is, for no other counts; but
it is undiscoverable, and therefore non-
existent. • All that science knows is less
than science can use and handle, as. nobody
yet knows what is electricity, although it
is harnessed in a hundred ways. And
science, has made the life to come no more
explainable than in the days of the philoso-
phers of the Apocrypha who wrote a few
thousand years ago:
“And man dieth and none come hack to
tell the way Therefore I say
let us fill ourselves with wine and costly
meats; let us dress ourselves in purple and
in silk; let each man have the fill of his
voluptuousness, and let no flower of the
springtime pass us by.”
The world has outgrown the loafing creed
of Omar Khayyam because it has art.
literature, science to fill up the hours that
would otherwise be empty. And those things
are enough for all men who use life as it
should be used—that is, to drink it to the
dregs; to keep keen always the appreciation
of sunlight and beauty, the love of strength,
of genius; of a woman and a child. Let the
spirits “cark their soles” as they please; let
the day after death keep it.s own engagements.
And praise God forthe gift of life in the
sunlight:
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.

“Baton” : We don’t all have our brains in
our feet. One of us (I’m S. Aus.) was sent
after a supposed sly-grog seller. He got a
job working for the suspect, and managed
after a bit to buy a bottle of rum from
him. But the sly-grogger got fly to the
notion that there was something wrong
about his man, and went through the con-
stable’s belongings on the quiet. As a result
he took the precaution of pouring the rum
out of the bottle and putting cold tea in
and then gave the owner the sack. As the
constable was footing it back to town he
tried a nip from the bottle and spotted the
cold-tea trick. He promptly threw the tea
away, went to the nearest pub and filled
up with rum again and went ahead with
the case. When it came on the other side
admitted having sold tile bottle, but denied
that it contained rum. But tasting showed
the dinkum article, whereupon defendant
scratched his head and threw in the sponge.
* * * *
“D. J.”: Met the most honest man in
Brisbane lately. I dropped a box of safety
matches, “made in Japan,” and after ex-
amining the goods he followed me ten
yards and returned them to me.
“Wessel”: While Australia imports
sponges from the Mediterranean and the
West Indies, there are first-class goods to
be had for the picking-up in Torres Strait.
J. T. Beckett, formerly head of the
Aborigines Department in the N.T.. who is
going to see what he can make of Vanderlin
Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, has
started a collection of beautiful specimens,
the best of them got from the north end of
the Barrier Reef.

“Arthur R.”: Before the war Germany
practically held the monopoly of refills for
pocket batteries. When the German stuff
was exhausted Japan came to light with a
battery that was practically worthless com-
pared with the German article. Then
Australian manufacturers produced a bat-
tery that runs rings round those provided
by either Germany or Japan. The price was
no higher, but the value was nearly treble.
This industry, at least, will be kept in Aus-
tralia, unless the importers’ agents sool the
wild Laborites on to it and smash it by
strikes and dargs and like curses.
“H. 0.” : That untidiness is next to afflu-
ence is the belief of at least one successful
Melbourne draper. By cultivating an
elaborately casual style of table-dressing be
is able to dispose of goods at practically
ruling rates while deluding unsophisticated
females into the belief that they are secur-
ing bargains. “The thing is to throw it at
’em, my boy,” he remarks in confidential
moments. “When stuff is done up in nice,
tidy rolls and has to be pulled down from
shelves for their inspection, they will buy
it only when they want it. Throw it in a
heap and make it look like salvage stock
and they will buy what they don’t want and
believe they are getting the best of you.”
“Broker”: Brewery travellers visiting
tied houses are a lordly crew. It was
Bung’s reception day, and his manner of
greeting those of us who didn’t come from
the Brewery was cavalier, not to say
insolent. We humbly begged for orders and
collected an odd case or two after a half-
hour visit, during which we treated an
assorted lot of loafers twice. But when the
Brewery traveller arrived! He swept
through the drought-stricken miscreants
with an air, unhooked his watch, and put it
down before him. “Now, Bung.” he roared,
“no funny business! Where's your
order?” The licensee hopped off his stool
and hastily produced a slip. The bagman
glared at it. It was a healthy list that
would have made our mouths water.
“What!” he howled, “Only ten cases of
Flip-flap and five of Rotgut? Not on your
life, old son! 25 and 20 for you.
You are buying too much outside altogether.
Don’t let the firm hear of it. Cut it out
now or !” lie planked down 6d. “Have
a cigar.” He departed. The thirsty crowd
snorted in disgust and a humble Bung
resumed business relations with the rest of
us.

“R.A.Y.”: Some weeks ago oysters were
going into Sydney faster than retailers could
dispose of them at the bolstered-up prices.
So the combine, or octopus, or whatever
it is that controls the trade, telegraphed to
North Coast lessees to ship no more of the
sliell-fisli till they got further advice. Own-
ers of some consignments already on coastal
wharves did not receive warning in time,
and their lots went on. But that didn’t give
Syd n e y che a p
oysters. The con-
signments w e r e
shipped back to the
port of despatch at
shippers’ expense,
the idea of course
being that those
fish which hadn’t
died should be re-
turned to the
water. It is said
that a three-bushel
bag of oysters, for
which the lessee
receives little over
£3, is often worth
£l2 to a Dago
'saloon-keeper; and
it’s his business to
keep the price up,
even if he has to
destroy oysters (at
somebody’s else’s
expense) to do it.

(Melb.).
“Bill O’Costs”- talks of his bread and
butter •: —
That “fine distinction,” as the indignant layman
calls it, between a “false pretence” and a “false
promise” has cropped up again. It does so fairly
regularly, but it is still hard to convince the said
layman that the distinction is a necessity of inter-
pretation as the law almost universally stands. Put
in another way, the false statement by which money
or goods are obtained must be of an existing fact.
Therefore if I tell O’Bung, across his counter, that
funds will be provided for a post-dated cheque for
£5, it is his funeral if he takes the risk and cashes
it. It is merely a false promise, though I may have
no intention of fulfilling it. But if I am rash
enough to tender him the same sort of paper pay-
able on presentation, my implied representation of
the fact of actual funds in the bank is, in general,
enough to warrant a conviction.
A still commoner form of the fraudulent promise is
that of the waster who • is going to-morrow to a
billet as Inspector of Bathing Costumes, or Censor
of Bookmakers’ Odds, at a thousand a year, or the
other whose rich uncle is going to hand over to
him everything, from *the estate in Fiji to his gold
pass over the railways, and he (the waster) will
call on Friday with the uncle in person. Each of
them only wants his fare to Melbourne in connection
with the business. There may not be the slightest
intention of performance, but who can say what
future thing is beyond the pale of possibility? And,
of course, the promises pitched are always credible
on their face, or they would never take anyone in.
Another point to be remembered is that the false
representation must operate on the mind of the
defrauded, so that if you arc really incredulous of
the impostor’s story about his hoard in the bank, or
that the watch he hands you is 48-carat gold, but
rely instead on the fact that you know him to
be the son of old Plunks, the affluent bottle mer-
chant, who may stand by him in an emergency, you
turn all his fraudulent spruiking to innocence, for
he hasn’t obtained the money by means of the fraud.
A neat illustration of this point occurred in Adelaide
some years ago. There the pigeon (the usual beer-
vendor), after relating in the witness-box the
accused’s tale of misrepresentation, naively admitted
that, while she lent a deaf ear to his story, she
turned a defective eye on the cheque he tendered.
It appeared he had adopted a name like “Whitley”
or “Waggly,” and so signed the stumer. Mrs.
Public-House, looking carelessly, mistook it for
“Wigley,” a well-known sporting lawyer whose
paper was beyond question, and cashed it. Result:
An acquittal, and another landlady trying to slap
herself on the back for joy.
It is very difficult to legislate for these cases.
The only remedy seems to be to refer all dubious
legends of affluence and all doubtful paper to a com-
mittee of two gentlemen named Donald Moses and
Levi Mac Porridge, who might be subsidised by the
Liquor Trades Association.
Perhaps, after all, there is wisdom in the way in
which, I notice, a P.M. recently dealt with such
a case as a minor offence. He brushed aside all
niceties of distinction. “A pack of lies!” said he.
“Fourteen days.”

“F. Gill’’: There is a fortune waiting for
the perfume-maker who distils the elusive
fragrance from the so-called “wild hop,” a
leguminous plant with tough leaves of ex-
ceedingly bitter taste. In the hilly country
of North-Eastern Vic. its fragrance is a
tantalising delight, coming and going so
erratically that it is difficult to say whence
it is exhaled. The scent is suggestive some-
times of stocks and sometimes of boronia.

“Broker”: Here’s a tip that may help
some inventive soul whose bright ideas have
not yet paid a dividend. There is a world-
shortage of metal capsules, which is caus-
ing profiteers in all bottle-contained goods,
such as sauce, lemon-squash, whisky and
castor-oil. something just less than dismay.
The Australian firms that have specialised
in capsules all their lives have had poor sup-
plies for two years; now their stocks are
nil, and they hold out no hopes of early
replenishing. What is wanted is a satisfac-
tory substitute, for they assert that metal
capsules cannot be made locally (though
such trifles as boots, pianos, rifles, motor-
cars, art books and wines are turned out
to perfection). There is strange prejudice
against the “crown” type for sealing any-
thing but beer, and the badly-needed alter-
native should set someone thinking.
POOR MON! POOR MON!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One day I saw two Scotchmen meet,
And both of them were very old,
And though the time was Christmas-time
The wind was bleak and it was cold.
The taller one was passing rich,
The shorter one was bent and slim,
And though he seemed a canny man
Good fortune had not followed him.
The wealth}' one, who kept a store,
Was mostly known as Candid Mac;
The other one was simply Jock
To those he lived with on the track.
Old Mac had long passed three score years,
And Jock three score and seventeen—
A native of the Isle of Skye,
While Mac was born in Aberdeen.
They talked of places they had known,
Of foes and friends of days of old.
And Mac from ’neath the counter fetched
A drop of Scotch (the day.was cold);
And when old Jock had swallowed one, ,
He raised his swag and heaved a sigh.
“Poor mon 1 Poor mon ! ’Tis Christmas-time,”
Said Mac. “We’ll wet the other eye.”
And then they talked of bonny hills,
Of chivalry and feats of sport,
The clash of battle-axe and sword
In battles that their forebears fought.
“ ’Tis gran’,” Mac said, “to meet you, mon,”
And then poured out another nip;
“I’m sad to see ye on the track—
Poor mon! Poor mon! Here, tak’ a sip.”
The grog had warmed Jock in and out,
It straightened him where he was bent;
He mumbled lowly in his beard,
Which seemed to wag with discontent.
And he was pacing up and down,
His grizzled hair was shining white —
“Now, who the de'il’s ‘poor mon’?” said he —
“I’m na sae puir that I can't fight.”
“Sit down, sit down, and smoke awhile 1
Don’t fash yersel’,” said Candid Mac;
“I’m thinkin’ oot a weenie scheme,
Poor mon, to help ye on the track.”
But Jock still grumbled in his beard:
“I neither want your bite nor sup.
Keep ‘Poor mon! Poor mon!’ tae yersel’,
Or put ’em up, mon, put ’em up!”

CAN’T BEAT COCOANUT
OIL FOR HAIR WASH.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most
soaps and ready-mixed shampoos contain
excessive Quantities- of alkali. This dries
the scalp, makes the hair brittle and is very
injurious. Just ordinary colinated cocoanut
oil (a pure, saponified but quite greaseless
liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly pse for a shampoo,
for this cannot, possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful make a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and
cleanses both hair and scalp thoroughly. The
lather rinses out easily, and takes with it
every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenly,
and comes out fine and silky, bright, glossy
and fluffy, appearing to be heavier than it is.
And. best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn't washed it at all. You can
get colinated cocoanut oil at mbst-any chemist,
but be sure it's “colinated.” which is Mot
expensive—a - few ounces lasting a long, • long
time. • :•
PAIN VANISHES! CORNS LIFT OUT
AFTER FEW DROPS.
Let To-day’s Corn Pain be Your Last Corn Pain.
Lift Any Corn or Callous Out with Finger-tips.
Wonderful! Girls! Save it a Corner on Dressing-stand.
-
No bunkum! No bother! Corns,
callouses —hard or soft —sore or
sensitive—all yield and loosen
and lift off—absolutely pain-
lessly.
This newly-found com-
pound, i,s named Frozol-
lee. and is still another
use of that great medi-
cal discovery “ether. - ’
.Stop at any chemist’s for
a little bottle of Frozol-Ice,
coating but a trifle, but which is ample
to free ..the feet .from each and every
corn and callous.
Apply some drops on to a delicate
i corn or callous. Like a Hash the soreness
vanishes, and soon the corn or callous peels
right off with the finger-tips.
Frozol-Ice is absolutely non-irritant, doesn’t
even inflame the surrounding healthy flesh.
Just fancy! No agony at all. no sting or sore-
ness while using, or afterwards, simply a
shrivelling, drying up of corns and callouses.
Girls! Save a corner on your dressing-
table for Frozol-Ice, and never be the “wall-
flower” of the ballroom again. Just some
drops of Frozol-Ice when corns begin aching.
Fain disappears—corn dies!
True Frozol-Ice is flattered by worthless
imitations. Avoid them by insisting on the
green label.
Why Physicians
Advise Magnesia
For Acid Indigestion.
Thousands of people whose stomachs
troubled them after eating have found that by
taking a teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia
in a half-glass of hot water after meals they
can do away with pepsin pills and other
digestive aids, and can still be able to eat
heartily of whatever foods they please, and
have no stomach trouble afterwards. Physi-
cians say that hot water forces a much
needed blood supply to the stomach, while
Salix Magnesia is undoubtedly the best, safest
and most powerful neutraliser of stomach
acids that can be found. A single teaspoonful
will sweeten the food contents of a sour, acid,
burning stomach in five minutes by the watch,
and natural digestion will follow without pain
or uncomfortable feeling of any kind. Con-
tinued use of Salix Magnesia does not
weaken natural digestion, and it is perfectly
safe to use at any time. It can be had at
almost any chemist’s (in powder or com-
pressed tablets form), but be sure it is Salix
Magnesia you are getting. Do not use other
forms of magnesia for this purpose.
“Atavism.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rjM HE traffic control stood in the middle
of the circus. A small crowd of
French refugees shivered under the
little protection of a shell-smashed house.
A piercing drizzle was falling and heavy
lorries splashed in six inches of mud. The
refugees, sad-eyed, looked on. The traffic
was all bound for the “shooting gallery,” as
the Yanks called it. The refugees were re-
turning to their places.
Darkness was over all; the one light was
the small green and red lamp 'of the traffic-
control, who .presently came into the shelter.
"Buck up. Grandma,” he said cheerfully
to an old peasant. “Votre gran’ mere?” he
queried of a pretty girl.
She smiled. “Non, Monsieur.”
“There ought to be some back-traffic soon.
I’ll load the good-looker ou one of our
quarter blokes for a drop of rum.”
A staff car —British —came along. The
staff-officer rapped out his destination, llis
tone annoyed the Digger, who said he had
orders to use passing traffic to send refugees
back.
“Ride for you, Grandma. This car’s going
to your place.”
“I also go there,” said the girl.
“Get ou, Grandma. You wait, Mn’m-
’selle,” he said to the girl.
The S.O. had breeding despite his superior
air. He got out and lifted the old dame in.
The car shot forward.
"Never judge a banana by the skin.” said
the Digger. "I could have sworn lie was a
A car came forward at a terrific pace.
“French staff, I’ll stake my, oath,”
said the Digger.
It stopped. The officer- saw the refugees.
He asked where they were going, and picked
out three. He was very business-like and in
a hurry. French staff cars usually were on
business and in a hurry. British staff cars
were in a hurry, too, but not always on
business.
Four lorries in succession took all the re-
fugees except the pretty one, who was be-
coming impatient. The Digger blocked the
(•racks of tin- shelter, and behind two
blankets contrived a stove in a petrol tin.
Soon another lorry blundered into the
circus. Even in the pitch blackness' the
traffic control guessed rightly. “Divvy trans-
port,” he said, and went over to the lorry.
He came back with a bulging pocket.-
"All right, M’am’selle. Lu roilurc est—e r
ivi—compreet She departie pour—pour —er

Mademoiselle shook hands with us and
thanked us lavishly. The Digger sized her
up and decided that she wasn’t the kind who
could be kissed safely. The Digger has an
uncanny appreciation of the shades of dif-
ference in women.
The traffic control took a hefty swig at
the bottle, and shivered ecstatically. "I’m
glad I didn’t give her to the Staff bloke.” he
said. But lie was a decent cove all right.”

“Funny thing, religion,” he went on, ir-
relevantly. “My old man wasn’t any sorter

dotty on it. I’m the only one in the family

wonder what it is?”
“Atavism, obviously,” said I, “as it missed
your parents.”
“Well, about a fortnight ago. I -was bring-
ing some Jerries down from the shootin’
gallery, and that cussed” He looked up
inquiringly.
“Atavism.” I said.
“Yes. It lost me a suoskter diamond
cross ring. They were a poor gig-lampy
lot—except some machine-gunners. and
some of them were wounded a bit. A Ger-
man padre was with ’em. Fine old chan:
helped me a lot. Spoke thei language well.”
“Snoke English?”
“No; he compreed English but lie spoke
German well. They understood him. any-
how.” (This with an air of surprise at a
German padre speaking German.) The mob
was souvenired pretty rough before I got
hold of ’em, but I got a fair picking.
Droving the mob and feeling pretty dopey I
noticed the .padre -wearing a snoshter dia-
mond ring shaped in a cross.”
“Did you souvenir it?” I asked.
“No. Something came over me—the
padre and the cross and things—and I—
well, I just couldn’t. It was that what
is it?”
“Atavism?”
“That’s the word. AVe went on and on.
and the sight of that ring annoyed me.
I told him to put it out of sight. He didn’t
know English, but he compreed what I
meant, and stowed it in his pocket. I saw
him put it there, and even then it worried
me and I told him pretty sharp, to hide it
somewhere I didn’t know about. 1 turned
my back on him while he did it.”
"It must have been a terrible temptation,”
I suggested.
"Temptation? 'Struth. it was (he dopiest
thing I’ve ever done barring joining the
Army!”
“What happened then?”
"I got as far away from him as I could—
kept him out of sight until I took a receipt
for the lot at. the cage.” „•
“Then?”
“Oh now we’re coming to the point where
rum upsets what’s it’s name?”
“Atavism.”
“That’s the word. IVell, I came across
some cobbers who’d sbuvenired a. bottle of
■ rum, two bottles of van blong, two bottles of
van rouge and a quart-bottle of fizz. The
more I had the less that —— ’ism of yours
had to say! At. the end of the last bottle
I’d have pinched the communion' cup from
St. Paul’s. The ’ism of yours—what’s
the word ?”
“Atavism.”
“Atavism was down and out. I wont up
to the cage and I said to the sentry: ‘l’d
like to talk to a decent old bloke —a Fritz
padre, Digger,’ says I, innocent like. The
sentry just laughed. ‘lt’s all right. Dig.’
says he. ‘I got it. How did you miss it?' "
There was a’hoot of a lorry. The Digger
finished his rum, grasped his rifle, and as
he walked out said gloomily:
“It’s hell and all this —— atavism !•”
O. H. LORD.
The Russian Need.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL the male relatives of the Czar
who went out of business in March,
1917. were charges on the country.
An income of £lOO,OOO per* annum each be-
gan at the age of one year and ceased appro-
priately at death. In addition the 30 who
were in* office at the time of the war owned
5000 square miles of Russia, 325 castles and
palaces, and 20,000 domestic servants.'
A story told me by an eye-witness ten
years ago comes to memory. Grand Duke
Serge (or Boris or Michael) ,*being fed up
with plain getting drunk and so forth,
brought a demi-mondainc into the crowded
dining-room of Moscow’s L’Hermitage. The
lady was clad only in shoes and stockings
and a large picture-hat. The fainting waiters
presumably supplied the last possible fillip
to the jaded palate of the Grand Duke. The
incident showed one side of the Russian
character: the barbaric top-dog. At the
other end of the string the steady gloom and
despair of current Russian literature is as
significant of the bottom-dog.
Between the two distant ends of the
national personality come some contributory
causes. Twenty years ago there was a wall
round Russia over whose crumbling stones
only Tolstoy and Turgenev and a few other
voices were loud enough to be heard. The
Japanese war broached some jealous, secrets ;
some mediaeval infamies and corruptions
came to light, mostly chargeable to the Czar's
poor relations aforesaid. Stories of droit
de Seigneur in the villages, of murderous
“drunks” of the dukes, of the Tartar showing
long before the Russian was scratched, of
the best champagne and brandy market in
the world—all these came, with other yarns,
of bitter, unbreakable poverty, of oppression,
of starvation death-statistics comparable
only with 15th-century plague obituaries. A
land of very rich and very poor; and a land
of semi-savages, too, governed by dishonest
might only.
Now, with another war hot yet gone from
the land, a couple of revolutions a week,
and the Bolsh playing the Duke’s part, the
wall has fallen inwards, and the voices that
penetrate the v debris are many and loud and
confusing. To the sound of one, Russia is
coming, by way of storm and bloodshed, into
her own at last; according to another, all
that has been slowly done for reform for 50
years is being destroyed for ever. Yet an-
other says that a new land and nation, not
Mongolian or Slav or Czech, are forming
in the crucible to point the way to all civil-
isation. Quien sale? The only certainty
one can see is that essential things cannot
ever again be as bad as they were under the
Poor Relations,
In a conglomerate of many nations, mak-
ing in effect the impossible meeting of East
and West —with Japan and civilisation spy-
ing impertinently on the Grand Dukes and
the Grank Dukes taking it out of the moujip,
with Tolstoy, Stepniak and Kropotkin cry-
ing out incessantly, and Germany steadily
building ships and sharpening swords—it
was a hard job to pick anything. Now. it
has become still harder. Yet two things
jump to the eye: the certainty above named,
and the belief that there is no Russia yet.
It is not fair to say tlxat the heaving mass
which will become Russia in 100 years or so
is 500 years behind the times. The tempta-
tion to say so is strong, but the statement is
not quite true. Russia’s main trouble is
that her 8,660,000 square miles are suffering
the need of a middle-class, the most necessary
ingredient of society. It is that to which
the spilled blood is flowing, the invaluable
middle-class, from whom spring' the arts, the
sciences, the professions—all the permanent
things of a national monolith. Between the
waiters who fainted and the Grand Duke
and his companion, between the starving
Warsaw herds and the duke’s 10 palaces and
070 domestics, there is as yet nothing to take
the blows or redeem the follies of either.
When this is established, as by historical
precedent it must be now that the dukes
have gone, Russia will become a real entity,
and the headless bodies and broken hearts
will be at rest.
■ The terrible realism of Gorki. Dostoevski.
Andreiev. the sordid incredible details of their
work—these are the serfs working up to a
middle-class. The wars, the disappearing wash
of brandy and champagne, the Bolsh and the
apt revolution —these are the forces of God
working down to a middle-class. In the Rus-
sian operas the strange penetrating sorrow of
the Rimsky-Korsakov music is the serf at
war, with the savage Byzantine settings, the
purples and reds of the ceilings and walls of
the rooms, the brass, the childish richness of
everything. Only in this over-coloring can
a Russian audience in church or street or
theatre get to know of middle-class comfort.
The casts of the operas include verv few
female parts, and those quite subordinate:
the themes are wars and dynasties and the
eternal reform. That, too, is barbaric:
woman is not yet important except to come
in at the end of the man’s day with the
wine. But in the suave and gracious Tcheliov
stories. “The Bishop,” and “The Steppe”
and the others, modern people go jn and out.
keeping true modern values. It is the serf
getting very near his middle-class
The darkness is impenetrable now; but,
history not being a fool, (lie light must
come in the end. Mind is the conqueror of
matter; there is no need to point to the
European war for confirmation of that. Holy
Russia, her sufferings, her ardent reforms,
her intense and deathless ideals, even that
childishness of vodka that was mercifully
taken away—all that must lead in the end
to a good place. The Poor Relations, cadg-
ing and doing no service, held her back for
centuries, but they are gone now. There is
a bit of a row going on in the Servants’
Hall, it is true, as there was in France 120
years ago: but presently a bulwark of striv-
ing. practical snobs will take a steadfast
[tlace in the middle of things to stiffen them.

Memoirs of a Corpse-losing Family.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I SEE that various papers are featuring
"The Curse of the Ilapsburgs.” We have
been accustomed to hear about that curse
for years, and especially since the war dis-
sipated the last of the luck of the family. Yet
though the Ilapsburgs went to pieces during
old Francis Joseph’s time, they had a long
run, and rose from little more than squires
to be the boss sovereigns of Europe. As- an
enthusiastic collector of royal curses it has
always seemed to me that the Stewarts or
Stuarts of Scotland and later of England,
Wales and Ireland, and at one time of France
-—the race from which George V. deduces his
title —\\ 4 ere a record dynasty. They couldn’t
go to a funeral without the tombstone falling
on them. They came to the throne because
the Bru’ce dynasty was limited to two, a
great man who died of leprosy and a small
man who lost a battle, spent a great part of
his life as a prisoner of war in a foreign
land, and then pegged out childless after a
great famine during which people ate o-ne
another. (In the days of David 11. Scot-
land produced “Christian of the Cleek” a
“cleek” being a hook which Christian used as
part of his man-traps). And after David 11.
ca me:
Robert 11., Stewart (really High Steward) of
Scotland, a person of no account.
Robert 111. (“King Blearie,” because his eyes
were chronically inflamed). He broke down because
his eldest son was kidnapped and allegedly starved
to death by members of the peerage whom the king
was too feeble to wallop. (This was the first lost
corpse in the family.) Then his second son was
captured at sea by the English and kept prisoner
as a speculation. So Robert lifted his large, gentle
old feet on the bed and turned his inflamed eyes to
the wall and died.
James I. spent most of his reign as a prisoner
in England. Got home and beheaded his uncle.
Wrote a book of poems like Webster and was
promptly murdered in a cellar. Left an infant son.
James 11. died young through the blowing up
of a primitive cannon at a siege. Left an infant son.
James 111. didn’t seem to enjoy life. Supposed
to have been killed in battle (or, rather, running
away from battle) fighting against his young son.
Remains said to have been carried away in a
sack on the back of a person unknown. (This was
the second lost corpse in the family.)
James IV. Supposed to have felt mean all his
life on account of the episode about his father. Pre-
sumed to have been killed in battle, but body still
missing. (This was the third lost corpse in the
family.) Left an infant son and a civil war.
James V. The “gaberlunzie,” or jolly vagabond
King, because he wandered about the country drink-
ing and fighting with all and sundry.- Said'to have
raised 12 illegitimate sons by many different mothers
to the peerage, but only one of them (Moray, who
was murdered) appears much in history. Number
of family left unprovided for, and by how manv
mothers they were left quite unknown. Died, aged
38, of too much gaberlunzie and of misery over a
lost battle, leaving an heiress one week old, a
foreign war and the beginnings of a robust civil
war over religion.
Mary. Spent 13 years in France; seven years
as a reigning queen in her own country; 19 years
as a confinee in England. Was Queen of France,
but lost her job in girlhood because her bov-
husband was practically dead on the wedding-dav.
lie was the 11th of the Valois dynasty, of which
it was said that all of them were bad and half of
them were mad, and the 13tli finished the race, being
murdered after reigning 13 years and being 13
kinds of a fool. Getting rid of this unlucky race
Mary returned unexpectedly to Scotland, where she
arrived early one morning in a fog. Her sole
welcome at Leith was from illegitimate half-brother
John, who happened to be there because he had
been out all night following in his father’s foot-
steps. Mary married her cousin, a thin boy who
drank and pursued ballet-girls. This marriage with
Henry Stuart changed the spelling of the name.
The second husband was blown up (the second fatal
blow-up in the family), it is alleged with the
lady’s connivance. In a moment of bitterness she
wrote to her prospective third husband saying that
the second husband smelled like his (the prospec-
tive third husband’s) uncle’s breath. She married
the third husband, who was said to have three other
wives living, but this wasn’t proved. Child by
third husband said to have been born in prison
very shortly after the marriage, but this wasn’t
proved either. Third husband died in prison in
Denmark. Queen beheaded in prison in England,
leaving son by second (blown-up husband). She
was the first headless member of the family.
James VI. (I. of England). Ninth of the line
and fourth to die in his bed.
Charles I. Beheaded. (Second headless member
of family, but, unlike his grandmother, had the
advantage of being executed by old acquaintances in
his own country.)
Charles 11. Eleventh of the line and fifth to die
in bed. Left no sons that the law would recognise.
James. VII. (or II.). Dethroned at sight after
executing nephew (third headless member of family).
Twelfth of the reigning line. First to die in a
bed lent to him by foreign potentate.
James VIII. (III.). Exile and mendicant. Second
to die in borrowed foreign bed.
Charles 111. Chronic exile and mendicant. Found
foreign countries very tired of Stuarts, who seemed
to be becoming a habit. Cadged for drinks in his
later years. Left no heir. Third to die in bor-
rowed alien bed.
Henry IX. Shed a gleam of respectability on the
house by earning his crust as a cardinal. Died in
his own bed paid for out of his own salary.
This headless family of Stuarts came to the
throne by marriage with the Bruces, and tin-
present royal family came by marriage with
the Stuarts ; so the ill-luck may be continuous
and may break oul again at any moment. It
all began when the illustrious founder of the
two-man Bruce dynasty (the subsequent
leper) killed the rival claimant to the throne
in church. It wasn’t a Sunday and there
was no collection to mitigate the sin. . Com-
pared with our own hoodoo, the troubles of
the Ilapsburgs aren’t worth a mention. The;-
didn’t knonv how to begin to be unlucky.

Content.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I would prefer my life be spent
Beside the soft and mellow sand ;
My only home a pearly tent
And spreading ti-trees close.at hand;
With sun and breeze to wish me joy,
Sea-music'for my cradle-tune,
A very brown and happy boy
Beside his little warm lagoon.
And watching tiny painted fish
Poking about among the weeds,
I’d be content and never wish
To be disturbed by crowds and creeds:
Or when the sea is very calm,
I’d sit beneath the quiet sky
And put my chin upon my palm
And watch the pretty ships go by.
I’d watch the ships go out and out
Like magic craft of fairy lore,
Nor would I care a jot about
The men who pushed them from the shore.
Bay boats upon a jewelled sea,
Brown smoke-clouds spiralling in air.
Are pictures fair enough for me—•
I would uot ask who put tjiem there.
I’d just be happy, bare and brown,
And feel the sun upon my face;
I’d leave the rowdy-erowdy town
To those who built the silly place;
And dreaming there I’d sweetly find
Forgetfulness of shambling feet—
The dusty, musty City mind :
The torturing turmoil of the street.

draw a royalty for every one of their records that is produced, as well as colossal fees for their performances.
The renewal of contracts secures for “His Master’s Voice” an extension of exclusive rights under much,
more favourable terms.
This great saving is to be passed onto “His Master’s Voice” patrons in the way of Liberal Price Reductions.

“Kindling,” the American drama now at
Sydney Palace, is a drub, tenement-house
tiling which never even gets out into the alley
for a breath of air, but stays, upstairs where
the audience can have a good view of the
sink on the landing and the wooden fire-
escape outside the window. The theme is
severely domestic, and the cheerless heroine
wears a bashed hat and ruinous clothes
throughout. Emelie Polini is Maggie Schules,
the young wife of an upright wnarf-iaborer
who believes in fresh air for babies and
would rather strangle a child at birth than
attempt to bring it up in such a rabbit-
warren as they inhabit. Not knowing that
the honor of fatherhood is about to be con-
ferred on him, he confides this sentiment to
bis shrinking young wife and drives it home
with a bitter curse at the rich who own the
slums the poor live in. His union goes out
on strike, and when his wife insists on work-
ing and he wants her to be a factory-’and
at 10 dollars a week, she augers him by
choosing the five-dollar-a-week sewing job
offered her by the female iceberg who owns
the house. The striker boils over at this
evidence of financial incapacity and snobbish-
ness. He only discovers the iceberg’s
identity after she has made an inquisitorial
call on her tenants at the instigation of her
honeyed young niece (a slummer in love
with the nice slum doctor), and he doesn’t
know that his worried missus, having taken
his anti-landlord discourse to heart, is only
going there to spy out the house for their
upstairs neighbor, the flash young house-
breaker-son of an ancient Irish female who
spends her life begging him to find honest
work. Incidentally, the awful young crook
is advertised as a prize baby from Wyoming,
where there is fresh air for all. So poor
Maggie yearns to get to Wyoming and raise
a son like that for herself.
* * * *
It is the same dreary apartment in the
next act. The robbery has been accomplished
in a fumbling manner. Maggie has 113 dol-
lars in her pocket, being the sum the
talkative pawnbroker down the street
gave her for a brooch belonging to
her protectress, the honeyed young niece.
A cigar-eating detective is on the trail
and is scaring the wits out of the house-
breaker, so, seizing his chance, he hides the
balance of the swag in Maggie’s room and
“Passing Show of
1920," at Sydney
Majesty's.
An earnest dancing
cowboy—Mel Ward
climbs down the
wooden fire-escape
out of the story.
Maggie’s husband,
in work again and
quite happy, is im-
plored to take her
away to Wyoming
at once. When he
demurs that he
hasn’t got the
necessary hundred
dollars, she tells
him that she has
borrowed that
amount from the
landlady’s niece
and hands him the
roll of notes the
pawnbroker gave
her. He counts
the money and
wants to know
where the extra 13
came from. She
tells him she had
saved that much
secretly. Pre-
sently, after throw-
ing her on the floor,
he has (1) the
pawnticket, (2)
the 113 dollars,
and (3) all the
latest domestic
news, including
Mum’s reason for
turning thief. But
of course it ends
right; and equally
of course the nice girl comes into that part
of the story.
* • • • *
Miss Polini, the frightened, smileless slum
wife in the dreadful duds, holds her audience
to the end. Harry Roberts, as her husband,
registers one of the bigger successes of his
heroic career. Maggie Moore, the pathetic
mother of the flash young thief, lights up
the play with flashes of homely washtub
humor. Marie Ney floats about the dingy
interior like a fashionable, sugarplum angel.
Olive Wilton, equally fashionable, is more
incisive as her slum-owning aunt, and G.
Kay Souper gives a pleasant imitation of a
slum doctor in love with the angel. John
Fernside steps lightly as the flash and flirta-
tious thief who wants to break up Maggie’s
charred bargain-sale cradle for kindling.
Cecil Brooking is a brisk house-agent, eager
to escape from the human kennel; and John
De Lacey, of the resonant voice, alternately
coaxes and bullies as the American stage
policeman who makes a cigar promenade
backwards and forwards across his face while
he “investigates.” Gregan McMahon is the
“producer,” and had a well-deserved call at
the end of the first performance.

The pictures of African jungle life that
Harry Kaigh Eustace is presenting, with
varying clearness, on the screen at Mel-
bourne Athenaeum Hall, are wonderful
reminders of how science has invaded the
domains of mystery since Livingstone was
“lost” in the African jungle, and H. M.
Stanley got credit for finding him. Mr.
Eustace is seemingly the greatest of African
big-game hunters up to date, inasmuch as he
has tracked the largest and clumsiest of
existing beasts to their native haunts and
photoed them whilst they were charged with
evil intentions. He has hunted the rhino,
buffalo, leopard, giraffe, elephant and all
kinds of weird zoological specimens with a
camera, and taken their portraits at
close quarters when, in many cases, the next
moment might easily have been bis last.

artless tendency to mild humor, Harry Kaigh

Eustace wins the

Melbourne Royal was to have sheltered
“Tilly of Bloomsbury” from Saturday, 13th,
but something happened to delay the lady,
so the revival of “The Silent Witness,” for
six nights only, is providing Muriel Starr
with an actually-last final-farewell season.
This is a poor sort of stereotyped American
drama for a long time favorite emotional
actress to be farewelling in. Neither heroine
nor hero, nor their combative, full-grown
son, can get fairly hold of the audience’s
sympathy. The same remark applies to
everybody else, bar Atholwood. He is a
conventionally honest old gardener; the
others are mostly unpleasantly-circum-
stanced, or else of no human interest what-
ever. “The Silent Witness” will be vaguely
remembered as a play with a purely theat-
rical prologue followed by three acts, during
which young Bud Morgan’s mother (a lovely
name to grow old under is Bud!) discovers
that the illicit male author of Bud’s being
didn’t die a violent death in the prologue,
but lived to become an eminent State Attor-
ney with designs on the State Governorship.
Therefore the newly-enlightened parent of
Bud aforesaid ceases trying to get the young
man condemned to death for a crime he
didn’t commit, and devotes a troubled mind
to the task of ridding Bud of the blight.
* * * *
The weakness of Miss Starr’s vo : ee no
longer permits of her being very forcible in
an unconvincing part; moreover, she never
seems to strive for more than the merest
surface effects. Frank Harvey talks and
walks in his familiar manner as the unhappy
father, and Frank Allanby is a different
Bud to what Louis Kimball used to be. Also

whether this one is more magnificent
when it leaves off its clothes than when
it puts them on. The super-beauty of revue
seems to be at her best when she has prac-
tically nothing on, but drags a barrowload
of material and gems behind her.
“The Passing Show of 1920” has fixed up
some sort of agreement with the alarm-clock,
and the catchers of theatre trains and boats
now have a sporting chance when they dash
out of Sydney Majesty’s at the end of the
gorgeous entertainment.
The J. G. Williamson Grand Opera Co.

“Lightnin’ ” is in its last nights at Sydney
Criterion. The company is shortly begin-
ning a gloom-dispelling tour of M.L.
At Sydney Lyceum, in “The Lion and the
Mouse,” charming Alice Joyce’s screen-dad
is a judge who in the course of laying down
the law treads on the Lion’s tail. The Lion
is a millionaire, and he roars and makes
things warm for ’s Honor. Alice as the
Mouse spills ink under a pseudonym in her
father’s cause, and, being installed in the
Lion’s lair to write his biography, obtains
evidence that clears the old man’s name.
Billie Burke is “The Misleading Widow” at
Haymarket. She is very popular with a
number of billeted army officers, and her
hospitality makes a hole in her sock. So
sbe fakes her Husband s death in order to
get the insurance money; and then the in-
considerate man resurrects and complicates
the plot. At the same house D. W. Griffiths’s
“Romance of Happy Valley” introduces
another prodigal son. Punters and Ikey
Mos. are linking arms this week to go and
see Nat Gould’s “A Fortune at Stake” at
the Lyric. Sessue Hayakawa paints drag-
ons and woos the lady at Crystal Palace.
The Piccadilly shows how William Russell
goes “Eastward Ho!” which is New York,
to get his rights and comes out on top mainly
because he can deal a straight left.
At Melbourne Majesty’s a new lease of
crowded life has been granted to “Kissing
Time” by its transference from the Royal.
The voices are brought nearer to people
who are furthest away, and more importance
than of yore attaches to the squad of tuneful
male choristers who pursue Gladys Moncrieff
and Maude Fane through their respective
ballads in the second half of the programme.
“Mother Hubbard” will continue its panto
monopoly at Melbourne King’s until the
middle of next week, and then sweet Elsie
Parkes will lead the Pipes of Pan ballet in
another sphere of action. Meanwhile the
P.O.P. item is the pride of the panto. Barry
Lupino is to be the hero of a send-off
matinee on Friday of this week. Artists
from all the theatres will assist in the camou-
flaged benefit. On Saturday next week
(27th) a number of artists from America
will he introduced to Melbourne at the King's
in “Tiger Rose.”
At Melbourne Tivoli the management is
still talking about the Most Beautiful Girl
in Melbourne, and Envy, Hatred and Malice
are still going through a form of dane’ng at
the Court of red Queen Bess. Sir Walter
Raleigh, by the way, is not nearly the big,
loud bounder he was when Shakspeare first
discharged his small jokes at the Moralitv
Ballet ladies. Claude Flemming has gone
from, the cast, and Raleigh Is now imper-
sonated by a well-meaning but unimportant
young person named Dunn. The violent
satire on Labor politics which used to be
delivered by Flemming in the last section of
the show is now uttered in huskier accents
by Kennedy Allen.
v «*;
The sudden illness of Daisy Kennedy has
obhged the Taits to cancel dates booked for
that gifted violinist at Melbourne Town Hall.
Which is to say they have to keep the dates
and pay the money and book new ones anon.
“Love is Love" is the top-liner on Hoyt's
Melbourne programme this week, with Albert
Ray and Elinor Fair in charge. There is
similar innocent rapture in “Cheating Her-
self,” wherein Peggy Hyland goes to the
country and poses ravisningly as a farm-
yard Phyllis. Harry Hilliard is the bold
young man who gets nearest to the dimples
under the suribonnet. Hoyt’s also screen
some Melbourne contrasts in slum and man-
sion, and finish with an interesting strip
from the photographic diary of overlander
Birtles. The Majestic is throwing a br'ght
light on darkest Africa about the Zambesi
and the Congo. In the fiction department
Clara Kimball Young is travelling “The
Road Through the Dark” as an Allied spv
swapping sticky kisses for German informa-
tion. A lighter and more attractive subject
is Olive Thomas exposing her demure cheeki-
ness in the Quaker story, “Prudence of
Broadway.”

From an Adelaide critic:—
The Society of Arts has lent its gallery {or an
interesting exhibition of paintings collected by F. G.
Koehncke, the Adelaide dealer, during a recent visit
to England. They are a fully-dressed and decorous
lot, representing the solid English virtues. Koehncke
seems to have bought up the studio of the late
Shaw Crompton, who has some 50 pictures here.
They are divided about equally between scenes in
Cairo and 18th-century costume studies. A ver-
satile r..ari, Crompton! Joseph Finnemore is heavily
represented, too. Cavaliers are his specialty; there
is one particularly delightful “Royalist” who (after
about three drinks, apparently) has discovered a
portrait of Cromwell and spitted it on his sword-
point. Finnemcre’s chief work is an enormous and
rather startling water-color, showing Lorna Doone,
bearded John, and a venerable Doone with strong
light behind him, giving his locks the effect of a
halo. Strutt, who painted Black Thursday in Vic-
toria long ago, is recalled by a war-picture of
German guns in heavy mud and trouble. It is by
his son Alfred, and verv much in the stvle of our
own H. S. Power. Other “gallery” pictures are
Craft’s “Price of Victory,” the reading of a casualty-
list in an English cottage; and “The Wizard,” by
Gotch —already represented in the Adelaide gallery
by “Destiny”—showing an Italian coniurer perform-
ing before a roomful of peasants. There are good
landscapes too; the best of them is an autumn Eng-
lish scene by J. Herbert Snell. The whole room,
with its wealth of anecdotal pictures, is a strong
contrast to the usual Australian collection of land-
scape and single figure.

Adelaide theatres are waking up from
their summer siesta, during which variety at
the Majestic has been the main rival to
pictures. This house stilt has Frank Gor-
man and the Kadomas, champion sculler
Felton and others, among whom Fred Bluett
is making a welcome reappearance. The
Royal, with hi? advance booking, is just
starting the “Sleep'ng Beauty” panto in
honor of the visit of B.'rdwood, which has
meant a crowded city and all manner of
social engagements. Eroni’s circus brings
a strong co.. and gets full tents. In pictures
West’s deals with red-haired Alice Brady,
who married a man practically in a cabaret
and undertook to reform him. Wondev<?raph

“Pongo”: There is a hopeful hric-H-brac
vendor in Sydney Royal Arcade. Displayed
in a prominent place in his window are a
number of rolled-gold rings marked “Week-

these days!
“T. D. Em dee”: The unexpected boom
of the Gilbert and Sullivan revivals in Lon-
don (B. 11/3/'2O) should stir up the Firm.
The presence of the great Savoyard, C. H.
"Workman, ought to simplify the business.
Frank Wilson is available, and Howard Ver-
non could be dug out for an experiment in
the grand-opera manner, alternating him in
comedy roles with Workman, except in those
operas, such as “The Yeomen of the Guard,”
in which the veteran does not play the Gros-
smith part. “Ruddlgore,” “Princess Ida’
and “Utopia Limited,” which were not too
successful when first produced in Australia,
might prove big hits with the present gener-
ation ; and, anyway, their staging would not
be likely to land the Firm in financial limbo.

“0.L.”: Clgude Haydon, whose Paolo-and-
Francesca opera is to be produced at the
Playhouse, is a battlhr. He has been a
piajio-and-eomposition student at Melbourne
Uni, Conservatorium from time immemorial;
and; throughout his career he has always had
to wheel himself around in an invalid’s
tricycle. Lately some of his little melodies
were rendered at the Chapter House, and
were greeted effusively by the musical
brethren. But there isn’t much red meat in
his music so far. It is more like cold roast
rabbit —very pleasant for a change, but not
mufth as a regular diet.

there was one hoarding only in the village,
and it belonged to the municipality. Travel-
ling shows leased it and the one board gave
them as much publicity as a dozen might
hllve done in a less tidy town.
“Stargazer”: Fib Graupner’s break-up
occurred while she was in Germany, whither
she had gone to perfect herself for grand-
opera work. It persisted, and death would
have been timely 20 years ago, when the col-
lapse took place. She is remembered here
for her brilliant career in light opera, Gil-
bert and Sullivan principally. Her best
work was as one of the three little maids
in the “Mikado,” one of the wives in “The
Gondoliers” (I can still hear her, as a pretty,
miniature virago, singing: “No matter, no
matter, If I can get at her, I’m sure that
her mother won’t know her again!”), and
as Phoebe in “The Yeomen of the Guard.”
Nobody has ever done these things better,
no one here has done them so well. Flora
Graupner was one of the many clever
Jewesses Melbourne has given to light opera.
Her father rAn a meat-canning works on ti}e
Saltwater at Footscray, and it was in these
mellifluous surroundings that the reporters
found Flo, then as neat as a cameo and as
pretty as a Watteau shepherdess, When first
the public developed intex-est in her. The
little woman’s first public appearances were
not with the Rosgl Com. Op. Co., as is
generally stated, but with Mrs. Lewis’s
Juveniles, a company composed largely of
the Graupnpr family, Flora, Lotty, Emanuel,
Charley and Sola all figuring in Mrs. Lewis’s
productions. Flo Graupner and Vi Varley,
working together in apparent amity, were the
keenest possible rivals, but when Vi Varley
died, practically at the of her career,
no one was more cut up than her competi-
tor. Flo was found weeping bitterly over
the news. “I never disliked anyone as
much; I never liked anyone as much,” she
sobbed. “And I know I shall never do my
work half as well without Vi Varley to keep
up to.” (
“Freda S.” (N’York) : Saw Nance O’Neil
in a Spanish drama the other night at the
Greenwich Village Theatre. She reminded
me of a vivid garment that had all the color
washed out of it. Shades of her as she used
to ornutnenJ; ftlig sta£e in “Mhgda” would
rise up and insist upon comparison with
the present gaunt, almost-scraggy Nance.
Either she has lost her magnetism or' the
play gave it no scope. Charles Waldron did
his best to liven things up a bit, and Mrs.
Henry Bracy was a good addition to a
dull cast.
F. G. Woods, though a bit of a bore on
the outgoing Vic. Board of Public Health,
nevertheless did something at the last
moment which w’ill make the gallery goo <
revere his name. He had an order passed
directing the Health Department to have
an armed-off space for every person. So
the occupation of the packer is very near
its end, as far as Victoria is concerned.
“0.K.”: Rather late in the day “Skipped
by the Light of the Moon” is to bb con-
verted in Englixnd into musical comedy.
Australians of mature age associate the old
rush-about farcical comedy with the name of
John Gourlay, who brought the piece to this
country in 1887, and produced it fp-st at
Melbourne Bijou House. G. R. Sims had
manufactured the unorthodox affair some
years earlier under the title of “The Gay
City.” In 1891 it was played in Australia
as “an amusing musical, eccentric comedy.”
That was when the MacMahons revided it at
the old Opera House, with Gourlay, Snazelle,
John Forde, Inglis, Harry Hodson, Aggie
Ivelton, Florence Esdaile and others in the
cast.
“Norbell”: I’ve just seen “The Man from
Kangai’oo,” and Snowy Baker does some
marvellous stunts. But Uncle Sam soon
gets in his dirty work, and the Australian
stoi-y becomes starred and striped. Snowy
as a parson rescues a squatter from a couple
of gas-pipe toughs of aggressively Amurrikan
brand. As a reward the squatter (who
looks like a grocer) suggests that the parson
should go to a bush township where the in-
habitants have barred parsons for years. So
bitterly anti-clerical are the station-hands
that they storm the local hall on the occasion
of the parson’s ddbut, notwithstanding the
fact that the boss’s missus is one of the stftall
but appreciative congregation. It simply
couldn't happen in Australia. In our Back-
blocks the parson is as inevitable as the
drought. Then the explanatoi-y stuff thrown
on the screen makes the rouseabouts talk
like cowboys in a Bill Hart eruption. Also
the heroine goes for a stroll in “the woods”!
But what else could you expect. Brownie
Vernon was imported from the Fillum’s Own
Country to impart the correct Deadwood
Gulch atmosphere to this Australian pic-
ture. When will we get an Australian film?
Barring the “Bloke” pictures, they all have
the flavor of chewing-gum.
“J.”: The dreary unoriginality of stage
“business”! That sound character-actor
Laui-ence Hardinge represents a profiteer in
the new show at Sydney Tivoli. Tremen-
dous play is made wfith a red silk handker-
chief worn in the bosom of an ill-fitting
dress-suit. That is because Mid-Victorian
tradition ascribed these props to the type of
nouveau riche whom Du Maurier used to flay

“Smith, 0.8. E.”: .If the Millions Club is
really anxious to -raise the prestige of Syd-
ney it ought to prevail on Hugh D. Mclntosh
to scrap his advertisement curtain at the
Tivoli. Theatres, like restaurants, give
character jto a city. No leading London,
Paris or New York play-house would dream
of turning its drop-curtain into a hoarding.
That sort of vandalism is left to “the pro-
vinces,” or to the poorer establishments of
tne outer suburbs. In addition to being an
eyesore Mclntosh’s curtain in an illiterate:
it doesn’t even spell correctly.
“Glen H.”: University profeissors and
other moles insist upon assuming that G. B,
Pshaw committed financial hari-kari when he
published “Commonsense About the War,”
but Bernard is certainly dissembling his
demise. “Arms and the Man” has been re-
vived in London by Robert Lorraine, and
the box-office receipts are larger than they
were during its first London season; and
Viola Tree is about to revive “Pygmalion.”
Mrs. Pat Campbell, who has been absent
from the stage for two years, will return to

London has tired of the bedroom farce, but
New York is still tickled to death by it. Of the
latest sample, “The Girl in the Limousine,”
the N’Yark Herald critic remarks: “The
authors seem to have searched their souls for
double meanings, and when they exhausted
them they frankly called things by their right
names. There were men in bed with other
men’s wives; men in bed with their fiancees;
Lieu under me tied | men behind bedroom
screens: and men and women undressed as
far as it is considered safe to go.”
G. B. Pshaw’s latest effort, “Heartbreak
House,” will go on in London as soon as
a stage is available.
The last mail from Uncle Sam bore the
news that E. J. Kilpatrick (“Kil”), well
known on Poverty Point, had entered into

“Sparking Plug”: Had an experience of
the electrophone (now a well-established

dinner at a friend’s place he called up the

Alhambra, where “Eastward Ho!” was the
bill. Through our instrument the confused

into a taxi, where I discovered another pas-
senger tucked away in a corner. We were
rushed to the Holborn Empire, where he
introduced me to the'manager as a man from
Australia to see his new act. The silent
passenger had vanished. When Carlton came
on in his usual rig—skin-tights, jacket and
lofty bald pate —he told a tale about study-
ing hypnotic influence and called for volun-
teers. A short wait, and a man got up in j
the stalls and made his way to the stage.
He was the passenger of the taxi ride. When
Carlton put the ’fluence on him he started in
and did some good ground tumbling. There
were two others of the same Sort. During
the show the subjects would endeavor to
sneak off while the human hatpin’s back was
turned. The house shrieked with laughter.
Carlton told me he only did the spoof stuff
in certain halls and kept his old straight act
for the Palace and the like. The lean man
made several attempts to get into the legi-
timate “magic” game, with a big act like
La Fayette’s or Goldin’s, but he failed be-
cause be was comedian first and magician
afterwards —much afterwards. In the
matter of digital dexterity he was no great
shakes. But he never missed the chance
of getting off a good gag; and as a talking
“magician” his was the best of all the single-
handed performances submitted to Australia.
“Fax”: Bolshevism has extended to
dramatic art in Russia. Local culchaw, as
much of it as remains unexterminated by the
furious Reds, lately experimented at .the
Moscow Art Theatre with a system of choos-
ing actors, on their personalties, to suit the
various types of character in the plot, with-
out regard to their respective reputations, and
each mummer was to write his own part,
“with the assistance of the author.” Perhaps
this helps to explain why Maxim Gorky,
being in the author line of business, now
complains that revolutionised Russia has
jumped out of the frying-pan into the tire.
Bert Gilbert, the original husband of Ada
Reeve, is a bit of an author nowadays. His
latest effort is a music-hall sketch wherein
he plays the part of a veterinary surgeon who
rescues a steeplechaser from the shafts of a
coal-cart, and gets the animal trained for a
big race, which of course he wins. The
author must have been thinking of another
expedition to Australia when he devised this
artless racing romance.
MAN’S UNREASONABLENESS.

“Mary Pickford, known as ‘the world’s sweetheart,'
has divorced her husband, Owen Moore. He deserted
her in 1917 alleging jealousy of Douglas Fairbanks. 5 '
He married her, although the hoardings teemed
With garish print in which the charge was burled
That she, from whose fair face true virtue beamed.
Was yet the sweetheart of the whole wide world.
Then, having made the final fatal step,
He left her in a fit of jealous rage,
Because he heard one mummer, just one cheap,
Flash, grinning film-star, loved her —off the stage.

“Charles Garvice is dead.”— Cable.
Th tady Di’s dark eyes there swim soft tears
Like unstrung pearls; they stain her rose-bud
cheeks;
No longer to her small and ivory ears
The clamor of the London season speaks;
The hounds, the scented and the dusk
She shuns, for life is but an empty husk!
Her heart is chill—
The pen which gave her life at last is still.
Sir Harry Clavering no longer goes
Lithe in his youth and splendid in his health;
His honest eyes have lost the light that glows
As lohe he broods amid his pomp and wealth,
For no one puts a blemish on his name
To start his purple flood to splendid flame;
He breathes a sigh—
The ink which made him, Death has bldtted dry.
Proud Rupert, Duke of Sudleigh, sneers no mor^>
Nor feels inclined to prove his heart is right
Wh4n the Last Chapter strikes him to the core.
Though sorrow makes his lean, dark features white,
Remorse has left his soul; he lacks the friend
Whd always cleansed him ere he wrote The End.
His guide has fled,
And his uncharted life looms dark ahead.
No tnore in many guisefc will .they swing
Across the printed pages on their ways;
The hand which moved the puppets drops the string,
The cardboard girl no longer mildly strays;
So, heedless of the gibes and chuckles sly
Of, really clever blokes like you and I,
Young maids and old
For a brief second feel life’s theatre cold.

THE REXONA REMEDIES
Produces of Quality.
Reduced Facsimile of the Triangular Stick.
OR years Rexona has been a household name in thousands of Australian homes, and has
always stood for purity and excellence of quality. We hear daily from people all over
A the Commonwealth, telling how Rexona has healed their cuts, sores, eczema, piles, bad
legs, and every kind of skin disease, after many other remedies have failed. Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap is just as well and favorably known as Rexona the Rapid Healer, and is unequalled
for the Toilet, Nursery and Bath. Those who have once used Rexona Soap love it and want
Rexona all the time.
We now wish to bring a new Rexona product to your notice; something for the men of
the family this time. Can you guess what it is? Why, Rexona Shaving Soap, of course! We
know how most men dislike shaving, so we have employed our knowledge and medical skill
in making a shaving stick which is of triangular shape, something much in advance of the old-
fashioned round stick. It is a worthy companion for Rexona the Rapid Healer and Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap. Can we give you a better guarantee for quality?
Rexona, the Triangular Shaving Stick.
A New Rexona Product.
Here is another idea in Shaving Soap—another Rexona triumph—one this time which will be appreci-
ated by men wherever beards grow. Rexona Shaving Soap contains the same Oils and Essences that have
made Rexona famous the world over, and is made on the Rexona formula, and thus makes a Shaving Stick
which is a soap and lotion combined. It makes for comfort and hygiene in shaving, and tempers the skin
against tviml and bad weather.
REXONA SHAVING STICK (medicated) is Rexona Soap specially treated so as to produce a thick,
creamy lather, which will soften the beard and improve the skin at the same time. It is delicately per-
fumed and medicated on the same principles as Rexona, and not only produces a lasting lather but purifies
and leaves the Skin in perfect condition. Being an antiseptic Medicated Soap, it has a tendency to quickly
heal any cut you may have the misfortune to get, and if troubled with pimples or blotches of any kind
will daily tend to improve them.
REXONA SHAVING SOAP is the highest standard of Shaving Soap that it Is possible to produce,
and a good Shaving Soap means everything to a shave, for if the beard is properly lathered a shave is a
delight; but if the beard is not properly lathered but is Stiff and haish, it is not Only artrtfldre on the user but
hard on the razor. >
EVERYONE knows how delightful Rexona Soap is for the toilet, and Rexona Shaving Soap will be found equally as pleasant for shaving. No cake
of Rexona Soap and no stick of Rexona Shaving Soap is ever marketed unless in perfect .condition, for we market Rextfha Soap as the finest of the fine,
and the scientific skill employed in its manufacture and the absolutely first quality of materials used produce in Rexona Soap atad Rexona Shaving Soap
soaps of superlative quality which represent the highest possible standard that we can offer to the public, regardless of expense.
Watch for the Triang'ular sticK.
REXONA SHAVING SOAP will be found the most economical Shaving Stick on the market, but care should be exercised not to dip the Stick in the
water, but wet the face and apply the Shaving Soap dry. A few applications with the shaving brush will quickly produce a thick, creamy lather, which
lasts and thoroughly softens the beard, leaving the skin in a healthy and hygienic condition after the shave. Everyone should use a Medicated Soap for
shaving, for, after going over the face with a razor and removing the bear’d, the skin needs a protection from the germs carried by the dust which every-
one has to face.
Rexona Shaving Soap is something entirely new in every respect. Watch for the triangular enamelled
box, for Rexona Shaving Stick is not round, like the old-fashioned kinds, but triangular, and packed in a trian-
gular enamelled box, tasty and neat, easy to hold, and dainty in every respect.
Rexona Shaving Stick is soil everywhere at I/O, or, if unable to procure locally, Will be sent post free
noon receipt of the price, 1/6, by the Sole Proprietors, Rexona Proprietary Company, 131-5 Clarence Street,
Sydney.

THAT natural beauty of skin and hair whi;h cannot be imitated can be obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap.
Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not assert tiis influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy
its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse——they cannot heal and protect the skin. Rexona Soap

. There was good racing by good horses at
Rosehill on Saturday; and incidentally tuere . was
good money in plenty for Ike. The favorites missed
every time, and for a couple of the .winners theie
was scarcely tuppence offering.
Sixteen started -in-the Auburn Stakes (6f.) '
most of the money went on Palm Leaf, Aries, Malt-
gilla and ' Sweet Rosaleen. All these were well up
at the business-end except Palm Leaf, who got
settled .at the start. But they weakened over - the
last half J furlong,' and the Mimer gelding Palmitic,
putting on run, headed the procession with
a length to spare!" In last Doncaster Palmitic, carry-
ing 6st. 101 b., gave considerable impertinence. This
' year he is weighted at 6st. 71b. On Saturday he„
humped 7st. lib. That this nag can run ‘a mile
out he showed in the Doncaster: when just beaten
in an eight-furlong welter last year at Rosehill he
carried Bst." 4lb. Before winning the aforesaid Don-
caster Hem won over six furlongs at Rosehill with
| (Jst. 1 lib. in “13?,” which for that course is good
going. Palmitic took the same time on Saturday
and won more easily.
Another of the Doncaster lot to attract attention
was Swift Shot, a Royal Artillery gelding who
last autumn - was one of the smartest two-year-olds
, racing around Svdney. He ,is handicapped in the
big mile at 6st. 12lb. Oit Saturday he hopped
quickly "off .the mark in the Club»Handicap with
7st., and was out by himself for nearly nine fur-
longs. The Doncaster is lan event three-year-olds
are addicted to -losing. It is a very hurried trans-
action. But Swift Shot is a smart, well-set-up eus-
tomer-and, -if -viewed as a preliminary test, Saturday s
gallop entitles him to at least respectful notice.
When Swift Shot blew up the remainder of the
mile and a quarter was left to Whitefield, Panacre
and lan Or, the last-named moving up from astern
with great rapidity at the turn. liennaquhair and
Poitrel were only" doing fairly well. At the dis-
tance Whitefield was holding Panacre, but lan Or,
swooping do\yn on them, settled the argument by
outstaying both. Ridden right out, he won by a
neck in 2niin. 7see. lan Or carried 7st. 91b.,
which is also his Sydney Cup weight. Kennaquhair
had 9st. 51b., or olb. more than his Cup Weight.
Both are obviously capable of improvement. What
Kennaquhair might have done had more use been
made off him can only be speculated on. He was
not even mentioned in the betting. Still, all the
omens .point to lan Or beiig at least likely to
start for the Cup in good racing condition. The
remark also seems called for that unexpected animals
have a long-standing habit of appropriating the
Sydney Cup. # m
Poitrel gave no trouble at Rosehill. He shifted
up from behind at the top of the straight, but get-
ting squeezed back Bracken apparently reckoned it
was no use carrying the matter further; The little
fellow looked bright and well, though still rather
burly for violent exercise. Another two or three
weeks will make a lot of difference in him. His
feet, always a trouble to Robinson, are standing
well, but until he warmed up on Saturday his usual
stiffness was noticeable.

At Caulfield last Saturday two-year-old
Earl Simon strengthened his pretension to be nearly
one of the best of this season’s beginners. Thusfar
there is. no well-defined best among the youngsters,
and the way is clear for something or other to win
a pot of money for its connections at the coming
A.J.C. meeting.

A pair of disappointing . battlers in
Kunegetis .and Gringalet ran a wonderful race -in
the St. Kilda' Cup at Caulfield. A mile from home
Gringalet led the field, slightly ahead of the mare,
and at the final turn they were still in front on
almfist level terms. A good many backers roared
encouragement to the horse, whilst the hopes of
the books were hurled at Kunegetis, a 20-to-l chance.
Struggling down the straight each of them in turn
threatened to. outstay the other. The .odd thing was
"that nothing else had been nursed sufficiently for
i+ i.i ’ P iir<" "lit "Ion" with a final dash whilst the
persistent neck-and-neckers were wearing one an< t'mr
me ram continued to be a match between the
pace-makers. Blessed were both the pace-makers when
the.numbers went up! The judge ruled a dead-he.it,
and the owners agreed to divide. Kunegetis and
Gringalet each carried Bst. Sib., so they stand -regis-
tered at present as ony and the same animal fqr
handicap purposes.

Old sporting friends paid the last tribute
to R. G. Casey by attending the private funeral
which took place on Friday when the embalmed
remains, brought from Honolulu to Melbourne,, were

nobbed with him at Melbourne Club, were among
the mourners.

Racehorses are good property, and any-
thing with a bit of blood is in great demand. At
the Koatanui (M.L.) yearling sale, W. G. Stead,
owner of Surveyor, gave 625 guineas for a colt
by Absurd —Sea Elf. The 18 animals that were put
up averaged nearlv 190 guineas.
When FJ.ying .Fos was.sold to Monte Carlo
Blanc the price was considered fantastic. Now
an Argentine buyer has bought Tracey (Rock Sand
—Topiary) for £53,000 —an increase of neatly
£16.000. The bookings will bring a lot of it back
to the purchaser. Tracey’s list was full for 1919 at
250 guineas, and for 1920 at 300 guineas.

The St. Patrick’s Handicap at the Q.T.C.

Mesnil, winner of the Ascot (N.S.W.)

aged gelding who was bought at Homebush eight
months ago for a tenner. He rarely sees a race-

being done in a back street in Five Dock. A Croy-
don laborer who has backed him consistently tor
moderate amounts is now £5OO to the good.

aged 11, swam 50yds. in 40 seconds. This little lady
is beautifully proportioned and employs a splendid
crawl stroke. Also she starts and turns superbly,
and doesn’t know what nervousness means.

Vic. sprint swimrrrner appears to be com-
ing on at last. Ivan Steelman, Frank Beaurepaire
and Tom Login were on terms for 75vds. in the
100yds. championship of the M.S.C., and then Logan
produced an . extra kick from somewhere and stoushed
“Bogey” over the last 25yds., touching the rope
2ft. to the good in 58secs. dead, which is a record by
2-ssecs. Stedman, reputedly Vic.’s master-sprinter,
was nowhere.

Owen Griffiths—the find of this year’s
junior swimming in N.S.W. —won the Metropolitan
All Schorls’ lOOvds. Ch-mpiouship (63 4-ss<=o ) at
Sydney last Friday. On Saturday he won the 220yds.
N.S.W. Senior Cadet Championship (2min. 21sec.),
his 14th this year.
* * * ,*
The world’s woman’s record for the 100yds.
breast-stroke was lowered lsec. by Miss Venning,
who, swimming at Brisbane, won the Queensland
championship in lmin. 27 4-ssec. Mina Wylie held
the championship previously, having covered the
distance iu Imin. 28 4-6 sec. at Brisbane in 1913.
Ttie Brisbane girl is only 18.
Civil Service upset all calculations on
Saturday in the Vic. eight-oared championship. The
course was 2-4 ' mi.es Irbm Coode isia.*d to the Big
Ciane. The knowing ones plumped strongly for the
veteran crew of farmers from Nagamb.e. Their
bow went list, and most of the owners were over
12st. Service we. e light at both ends, with D’Arcy
9st. 71b. and Edwards (bow) the same. Nagambie
led well till the open water at Victoria Dock, when
D’Arcy quickened. Service took the lead and, row-
ing with good style and judgment, were never headed.
Tney crossed the line a good haif-le.igth to the good
in it Sin. 8 4-usec. It was tne sort of win that a
slashing Park eight used to record in the Donalds’
time.
The sculling championship fell to the popular
far.e>y—Barton, of Richmond. He Jed all the
way and won by quite four lengths in 18min.
60 4-ssec. from C. Coiiyer, (iee’.ong.
* * * *
Sculling-champion Felton’s newspaper
invitation to the Prince of Wales last week (he said
that he would like the young man to lUaen wah
him at his training quarters) is possibiy inspired.
Modern princes do a lot of this sort of thing, just
as the princesses have tea with V.A.D. s and
join in their carois. it womd be a very good stunt
from the point of view of the Prince s managers,
harry, who is popular in England, would of course
be a guest, a..d the photographs of the three,
cheeriiy discussing liver-and-bacon or some such
simp.e fare amongst the impedimenta of a boatshed,
wouid La.e a great vogue. And, incide.itai.y, tne
function would give the match the boost which it
rather badiy neeus. *
Norths opened the eleventh round of Syd-
ney grade cricket on Saturday against ’ Varsity;
and they kept the students on the run all the
afternoon. Only four batsmen managed to get out
and the wickets averaged a shade over 128. Punch,
whose consistency this season has been remarkable
in one so young, was 180 n.o. Hall and Ring
both got centuries, ar.d Cooper was unlucky to miss
his. Middle Harbor’s inability to muster a hun-
dred between them against Balmain was ascribed
by some to the Manly Carnival: it was really
the wicket aided by Folkard’s line length bowling.
Bal.’s batting was feeble on the whole, although
McCoy, who got 82, performed well between lapses.
The villagers’ fielding was unusually poor, which
was why Mailoy’s nine wickets averaged as much as
10.5. The Smiths get all the limelight these days.
O.S. played a fine innings of 148 for Petersham
against an extra strong Gordon team. The colt
Steele again batted well, and seven Petes have
fallen for 366. Diamond tried seven bowlers; and
Macartney, on the “dead easy” wicket, did best
with; three for 93. Hendry (116) and Levy (96),
of Waverley, kept the Paddington fielders busy,
the rest showed want of practice. Hendry, perhaps
the most brilliant of the younger cricketers, is
edifvinaly energetic. Nothing short of a delude or
other act of God can stop Sidney from beating
the prospective premiers next Saturday. Wests
got only 146; Pratten and Arnott alone showed
any form. Asher (five for 44) and his ‘straight
breaks were chiefly responsible. The weakest
teams, Glebe and C. Cumberland, met in this round
and the orehardists got their opponents out fairl;
cheaply—Gray (72) alone offered any opposition.
The Cumberland fielding was as usual rotten. Kelle-
way and Graves played skittles with the G.c.
batsmen, who have lost seven for 41.
* * * . .
The 20th annual track championships
(and the first since 1915), conducted by the Vie.
A.A.A., occupied the Scotch College Ground Mel-
bourne, last Saturday. “Breezy” Gale, the V arsity
sprinter, cleared up the 100yds. and 220yds. flat, and
pursued “Bat” Linehan in-the quarter. His two
firsts and a second are just-behind the sprint per-
formance of “Bubs” Nieholls (Bendigo Hare and
Hounds) ; he had three wins at this meeting some
17 years back. P. L. Edmunds won both sprint
and quarter hurdles, though in the 120yds. cham-
pionship Almond, the ex-Scotch Collegian, beat him
over every jump and just failed by inches in the
dash for the tape. Linehan simply cake-walked
the imile and Jmile in sound times for a_ perfectly
circular track with a poor surface. The clocks
ticked 2min. 2 4-ssec. for the half, and 51^secs for
the circle. “Bill” Murray did thfe mile walk in
7min. 5 4-ssecs„ and the three miles in 24mm.
20 3-ssecs., and won with plenty in hand. When
Murray went to the games at Stockholm the judges
rubbed him out for ambling, and that fact has
never been dispelled from the minds of a big
section of the followers of the sport here. The
Australasian Union has decided to reduce the walks
to one event of two miles. If a popular vote was
taken the walks would be oushed off the pro-
gramme altogether. The mile flat was won m
game stvle but in poor time by H. L. Davis (St.
Stephen’s) in 4min. 49secs. Davis is a son of old-
time hurdler Harry Davis. Brown, the mile Aus-
tralasian champion, was an onlooker. Sid Nieholls
(Essendon Harriers) won the three miles -from Tom
Vines in 16min. Usees., making lus own pace all
the wav. He ran second to “Friday O Neill in
the two m’les steeplechase. The high jump saw
Farhmon (’Varsity) tie with T. J. Fitzmaunee (Essen-
don Harriers) at 6ft. 9Jin. after one of the most
spectacular struggles of the day. N. G. H. Tranter,
the Public School sprints and broad-jump champion,
stunned only for the broad leap, which he took at
21ft. 6in.
* * * *
Gerald Halpin (N.S.W.) showed the rim
Of his rear wheel to the pick of Australasian amateur
cycling champions at Brisbane on Saturday, when he
took the half-mile title in lmin. 20see., which is not
bad for a man who recently broke both his arms.
He defeated Ashby (10-mile champion) in the heat,
and Castegnola (mile champion) in the final, in
the 10-mile event J. King (Q-) made amends for
many defeats bv wind’-g from A. Mc r ’nnoid (vie.)
and S. W. Ramsay (Vie.) in 26min. 64sec.
A DAY WITH THE TURRAMURRA HUNT CLUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The residential suburb of Turramurra is afflicted
with a plague of dingoes, and many nurses are afraid
to take their charges out walking.” —Sydney Sun.
It is a perfect hunting morn, and breast-high lies
the scent: -
The Field has met near “Mon Repos,” on sport and
duty bent;
Near “Mon Repos,” the bungalow of Mr. Albert
Jubb,
The Hardware King, and, furthermore, the “thruster"
of the club.
Conspicuous amongst the throng who .round the
Master press
Are Blinks upon his Indian—three horse-power,
more or I&>s
And Bloggs, the Pride .of Lindfteld, and young
Sniffkins in his Ford,'
And Smiggs .who steers a push-bike and has just,
bought “Bon Accord.”
And now upon the Cordon-road a striking sight
appeal's.
It is the Pack! Poms, poodles, pugs and Aberdeens
whose ears
Resemble fans, and black-and-tans and Skyes are
there galore:
Some lag behind the Whips, while others hurry on
before.
Yoicks! Tally-ho! Crank up! They’ve found l
The quarry is away! - '
A dingo steals past Mrs. Peel’s. A in a dray
Attempts to fell him with a brick; he dodges like
a flash;
And after him the Field proceeds with admirable
dash. •
Down Arabella-avenue, past Halloran’s estate,
A' 1 momentary check occurs by Smithurst 3 “trades,-!
man’s gate”; ’ ~
Then on like hell to the hotelwhich tops ,the.
i Pymble hill,
Brakes off and throttles .out; :and all hands driving
with a will.
»Ui silence (broken only by the gasping .of the.
ears,
The cries of injured hounds and of astounded folks
in bars) .
The Hunt sweeps past. What sound is that ? A
shot I Another ! ! Jubb
Is seen with’in his limousine his gun trained on
some scrub. : ".'■■■•
A pipped house-agent scrambles forth and calls
for the police.
“Out of the road!” the Master shouts. “Shut up,
you blighter ! Cease !
Where did he go?” “Dowp Hill-street, past the
Roseville Station,” cries
A sporting local milkman, “an’ then ,up the
Chatswood rise!” -
The kill was in the open (by a tram in Chats-
wood town) :
Jubb shot him in the leg, and Blimpson’s Hudson
ran him down;
Two Airedales broke him up, the only remnants
of the pack;
The club then gave three hearty cheers and all
drove slowly back.

Mrs. Geoffrey Syme gave a joyous party
at Blytheswood last week to introduce her
just-grown-up daughter Mardie to the social
round. Mardie is a black-eyed beauty. She
wore a paddy-green hat and had shadow
spots of green on her simple white frock.
Mrs. Syme’s young sister Eileen and two
cousins from England were in the welcome
ing party. Cousin Esmd Tennant wore a
lavender hat and a bronzy-brown dress.
Eileen Garnett, in white, had one arm in a
sling. The damage was done, at tennis, and
Surgeon Syme had just finished a few
repairs. Mrs. Syme’s black frock was etched
out in narrow rays of steel beads. Neigh-
boring young folk were there in lovely garden
frocks. Mrs. Herbert Syme, Mrs. Bowes
Kelly, the Murray Morton dame and Mrs.
Campbell were among the grown-ups. The
tea tables had orange trees growing in
golden bowls and orange-blossomy trees were
on the terrace and verandahs. Walter Kirby
sang in the billiard-room, and then gave
some impromptu Gilbert and Sullivan items
in the drawing-room. Mrs. Con Daly accom-
panied him in a song of her own.
The Leigh Falkiners had a dance last
week, and the young people are still exclaim-
ing about its splendor. The Falkiners have
a country home in N. S. Wales and another
at Macedon, but they spread the party at
the St. Kilda Town Hall. Sassiety was
delighted because they lured ashore the boys
from the Australia and brought down the
lionised knights of the air as special
partners.
Sassiety has been stirred by dentist Hug’s
divorce of his erring little missus, who was
formerly Doris Duckett and a member of
one of our best families. She was only 19
when she married in 1913, and apparently
the pair lived peacefully until a former flame
returned from the war. The latter com-
bined the glamor of the warrior with the
sticky name of Cyril, and Doris most remem-
bered that her name was Hug when she was
in his society. The affaire reached a. climax
at a week-end at Sorrento, where the out-
raged hubby stoushed the co-re. instead of
exchanging cards and ordering pistols for
the following daybreak. This, followed by
a prosaic action in the Divorce Court,
stamped Hug as a person unable to take a
romantic view of life. Cyril, whose other
name is Scott, is a furniture warehouseman
and lost four brothers at the Front.
The Rupert Atkinsons had to juggle with
three flats before they escaped on the Megan-
tic for England. First they sold a precious
house and furnished a fiat. They sub-let
that and flew to Cliveden. Then for the
baby’s sake (or it may have been for the
poet’s) another flat was engaged at Yarra
House for nurse and the infant. Then the
tenant of the sub-let, flat suddenly threw
flat and furniture on the shoulders of the
rich poet and his wife just as they had their
Saratogas packed for departure. Papers
and deep thinkers are worrying just now
about the poor and the high rents. They
really should give a trifle of sympathy to the
pathetic rich and their worries.
Vernon Weston Pett, back from the war,
came down to town from the family squat-
tage to share a 21st birthday party with
twin-sister Beatrice. The Grange, the
Toorak home, had a whole week of revelry.
Under-Treasurer Minogue lias been oper-
ated upon in a private hospital and is
doing as well as can be expected. The Bohe-
mian Minogue is a unique brand of Under-
xreasurer, combining a genius for figures
c-Th " taste t\,r spaghetti and the company
of artists and writers. His many cronies
miss his cheerful laugh and fund of anecdote.
Colonel “Ned” Grigg, of the Prince’s staff,
will arrive in Australia in mourning. His
mother —who was Miss Deas-Thomson, of
Sydney, and a grand-daughter of Governor
Bourke—died recently in London.
Though fashionable in accent and deport-
ment, Walter Marks, the new M.H.R. for
Wentworth, still makes Willie Kelly’s
absence felt. The pew yachtsman has none
of Willie’s persiflage. His biggest qualities,
as far as the new House has discovered them,
are a well-bred tolerance for others’ views
and a gentlemanly urbanity in expressing
his own. He patronises profit-sharing, and
the other night some of his new friends
nearly swooned when he told them that the
workers deserved a decent cut of “the wealth
they produced.” He is of the idealistic
Liberal type, demonstrated more naively
bv Captain S. M. Bruce, who. bv the way,
practises profit-sharing in his softgoods
business. Por the present Marks is too re-
strained bv his sense of decorum to become
vociferous about his ideas. This will hold
him to the back rows of a House wherein you
must be stentorian or truculent to win re-
spect. Physically he is rather engaging, and
has an actor’s countenance strongly resem-
bling that of Walter Baker, but he suffers
from deafness brought on by shell-shock and
only overcomes the handicap by using an
instrument, like W. M. Hughes.
Archgaiters Clarke and daughter Alice
were farewelled last week by the Gaud
Mayor and Mrs, Stein. The party began
iu the Mayoress’s boudoir rooms and dntted
up to food iu the supper-room. Prof. Allen,
Colonel Merritt and'Henry Weedon added
speeches after the Mayor had orated. Canon
Hughes and his lady were there; also the
Millers, - Spowers and Landales. Bishop
Langley, Archdeacon Hindley and other im-
posing church-members moved heavily about
in the fete atmosphere. Senator and Mrs.
Fairbairn; Stock Exchange Roberts, the
decorated Maudsle-ys and Dr. and Mrs. Floyd
were of the company.
Eddington, which is close to the point
where three electorates meet, was invaded
by politicians the other day to see a soldiers’
honor roll unveiled; and Lawson was shown
the kirk where his dad, after a long drive
from Donald, used to preach to the guid
folk on the Sawbath. He managed to get
clear without any elder telling him that it
was a peety he didua become a real meen-
ister like his fayther.
Towards a testimonial of £50,000 for
Archbishop Mannix £23,400 was promised at
a meeting held on Friday night in Melbourne.
Jack Wren, who was put iu the chair,
started the ball rolling with £5OOO. Think-
ing it was up to him to follow suit, Count
O’Loughlin,, of Tara Hall, a neighbor of the
prelate’s, planked down a similar sum, with
£5OO for his wife added. Just as if he were
dealing a card in a game of poker, P. Cody
shelled out another £5OOO. Then it was as
aisy as kissin’ your hand to get £lOOO each
from six others and sundries to make up
the total stated. The promoters talked coolly
of handing the Arch, a cheque for the full
£50,000 on Saturday night (March 20). As
Dr. Mannix is not a wealth-seeker, the curi-
ous are speculating as to how he, will use the
money. He declines anything in the way
of a personal gift. Newman College, within
the Lniversity, is said to be still his favorite
child.
Fine child Birdwood was. According to
the Austealassabj :
General Birdwood was born shoulder high. Lady
Birdwood was an amused spectator.
Norah Delaney has been winning honors
all her young Australian life. She gained
the Associated!
Boar d’s highest l
award in 1910; then
journeyed to Lon-
don for further
study. Her scholar-
ship passed her into
the Royal College,
and Kathleen Goodi-
son made a prot6gse
of her. After
that she won
two more scholar-
ships, which gave
her four years in
London and Paris.
In Paris Carreiio
looked the girl over
and, after getting
some valuable les-
sons from her, Norah
came heme to bloom into a star just as the
war clouds postponed all ambitions of the
sort. So she devoted herself to war work
and study. Now she is getting ready to try
her wings in a still-unsettled world. Alice
Mills made the picture.
Freda Sternberg from N’York: —
The Marie flail heiress —nowadays Mrs. Billy
Sheppard—is on her way to Australia with her
aviator husband. She is at the moment brightening
up the Hotel Knickerbocker with some Paris gowns.
She is thinner arid much more “grown up” than in
her Melbourne flayer days.
The Sam Mackays’ daughter Elsie is thrilling
Broadway with her performance in “Clarence” —
one of the best shows of the year. Even if her act-
ing leaves something to be desired, she looks so
charming.
First she would and then she wouldn’t. Frances
Alda was to have gone to Australia in May, with
all sorts of concerts in view. Now the trip is all
off. Base rumor says the cheques offered at the Aus-
tralian end were not big enough. So the prima
donna is creating new rSles at the Metropolitan.
Mark Sheldon has had an encounter with a ’flu
germ and had to take to bed for a week or so. He
is up once more and busy. Mrs. Sheldon and the
family are keeping up the social end from their
apartment at the Gotham Hotel.
Ray Aikman, Melbourne Gaud Mayor’s son and
heir, has been doing Broadway very thoroughly,
and will return home brimful of the latest jazz.
Archgaiters Clarke was farewelled by on
immense audience in the Town Hall. He
attempted no star performance in his reply,
but talked in the style of the elderly vicar
to his flock. The best that can be said of
him is that he made few mistakes because
he took few risks. Possibly he got scared
after falling in badly a few times. One
Sunday he denounced the Factories Act for
depriving old. infirm and slow workers of
the chance of making a living. It was a
very limp Arehbish. who next morning read
the sections in the Act making special ore-
vision for the three classes he had named.
Rumor says that after an exhaustive test
of a new system of beating the bank at the
roulette table, the Parer family of Mel-
bourne and some others have sent a rep-
resentative to Monte Carlo to try it. On the
original capital of £l5OO three big dividends
have been returned, and there is still about
£lOOO in hand. Another member of the
family is flying to Australia, so there is
plenty of interest in life for them at the
moment.
The three Melbourne dailies have made
Dr. Mannix a cardinal without letting
Benedict have a say. In the same fashion
they have translated him to Dublin without
giving the clergy of that archdiocese a
chance to vote on the subject. Anyhow, he
is to leave in the third week in May for
a trip to Rome, going via America, and while
overseas will have a look in at Ireland.
Meta Pelham has just returned to Aus-
tralia and will revive memories of Brough
and Boucieault by
her reunion with
Mrs. Brough. They
are to play together
in “Tilly of Blooms-
bury” at the Royal.
Though she was a
grandmother long
ago, she still lives a
busy stage-life. She
played with George
Alexander at the St.
James’s, and at the
Savoy with 11. B.
Irving during his
last season there. As
recently as last
March she was at
Arnold Bennett and
Nigel Playfair’s
Repertory Theatre,
and then she went to Birmingham Reper-
tory to play Mrs. Hardcastle. She was
released from that engagement to oblige
Mary Moore (Lady Wyndham), who got
the clever, old lady to create the Countess
of Lamberherst in “Our Mr. Hebblewhite”
at London Criterion. This ran for six
months, and Mrs. Pelham left for Australia
a few weeks after its termination. She
came with her daughter—Mrs. Roberts, the
widow of a London bank manager—and a
brace of grandsons. The Johnstone-O’Shan-
nessy studios made this picture of her.
Having hoarded £750 for nine years, the
Vic. Geographical Society is endeavoring to
raise another £1750 to commission Bertram
Mackennal to fashion a statue of Matthew
Flinders for Melbourne. It is difficult to
get profiteers, politicians or even poets to
take any interest in the subject at present.
Perhaps when Edward Vll.’s bit of bronze
is upended in a few weeks’ time, statue-
erecting may become fashionable again and
fat purses release a few Collinses.
The Spinners—a busy Scotchbyterian
circle sponsored by Mrs. Robert I-larper—
are getting to work again after a summer
rest.
It will be very hard luck for Jim Beckett,
the old Melbourne pressman, if the lugger on
which he sailed from Thursday Island to
the Macarthur River and Vanderlin Island
has really been lost with all hands. There’s
a good hope of it turning up, for a month
overdue is nothing for a sailing-boat in those
parts. Vanderlin Island, of which Beckett
has a lease, was discovered and named by
Tasman in 1644, and no white man knows
much more about it than Tasman did. The
nigs allege that there is a lake in the
middle of the island with porpoises and
dugongs and other sea creatures in it, and
Beckett was keen on exploring the place.
Adelaide has a look round
Birdwood has bounded the social horizon for the
week. First he met women war-workers at the
Returned Soldiers’ Club, shook hands with 300 of
them, said a word to most, and was rewarded with
a wood-and-copper casket. When he had bowed
himself out the R.S.A. conducted him through their
premises and gave him a cup of tea, a life-pass and
a picture of the departure of the first Australian
and Maoriland transports.
From Austral Gardens Birdie went to the Town
Hall, where the Commonwealth Club lunched him
and there he met the Comforts Fund. Then a gar-
den party at Government House, and finally a Bat-
talions FCte at the Chcer-Up Hut. The former
was a record for size and an encore of he Galway
farewell as far as dressing went. Lady Birdwood, in
soft mole, stood beside her husband, and they both
shook hands with the whole 2000 guests without so
much as a wince.
From the Battalions Fete the General came laden
with parcels and a hunting-crop that the women
members of the Clubs had given him. On Satur-
day he unveiled the Hut’s honor roll of workers—
nearly 500 women who for five years cooked and
served unnumbered meals and wrestled - with the
washing up. Tuesday was -peace. On Wednesday
hospital inspections and the like, and dinner with
the Josiah Symons at Upper Sturt.
The Army Nurses (260 went on active sendee
from this State) have had their first reunion at
Austral Gardens, with Col. Shepherd in the chair
and the committee of the Army Nurses’ Club as
hostesses. It had been hoped to have Birdwood as
chief guest, but that fell through, so the nurses
were bidden to meet him at Government House on
Saturday morning.
The Weigalls are due to leave London on May
18, which will just give them time to unpack before
the Prince appears. They’ve had lunch at Bucking-
ham Palace, with him in the party.
One of the star exhibits at the Show was a pack
of woollen goods from the South-East. A Mrs.
Henningsen shore the sheep, scoured the fleece and
spun it into yarn on a self-made spinning machine,
dyed it when it needed dying, and then evolved any-
thing from a blanket to a sock or cap. But they
won’t make her a Dame for it. It’s easier to get
things like that for thriving than for thrift.
Three old Adelaideans went west during the week
—Moses Montefiore, whose uncle Joseph gave his nann
to Montefiore Hill; E. L. Hamilton, who married one
of the Handgll clan of Mount Crawford and was
Protector of Aborigines for 31 years; and Benjamin
Fisher, who was organist at St. Peter's College for
many years.
Friday’ was a day of blazing sunshine for the
mayoral garden party at Victoria Park, where
Japanese balancers, parson and variety-artist Gorman,
captured German guns and other distractions were
provided to amuse the multitude. The acting vice-
regal Murrays and Lady Birdwood arrived about
four —she in cream georgette and satin and a black
lace hat, and Miss Murray in embroidered grey crepe
de chine. General Birdwood came on from the'Purlia-
mentary lunch. Mayoress Moulden’s frock was of
cool green brocade, with a swirl of pink at the
waist and a transparent hat of the same colors.
Mrs. Moulden, by the way, has had a brief visit
from her brother, new Senator Drake-Brockman.
“Shierlaw’s horse,” a prominent feature at the
fashionable end of Ilindley-street, has disappeared.
It is difficult to say why a horse ou top of the veran-
dah should have figured as the sign for a clothing
establishment; but there, till last week, it has been
as long as the oldest inhabitant can remember.
Mary Gillison, daughter of Chaplain-
Captain Gillison, is to be married at Easter
to Dr. Varley. Mrs. Fryer gave her a party
at Glenferrie, and guests took the oppor-
tunity to farewell the Swinburnes. . Mrs.
William and daughter llita leave for Lon-
don at the end of the month.
Gwen Affleck, of Hawkesdale, is showing
off the solitaire diamond given her by-
Charlie Kelly, of Toorak. The wedding is
billed for May. Gwen is a grand-daughter
of big squatter Affleck, of the Wimmera, who
left a hill of wealth behind him.
Harry Moorehead, who returned to the
inky way from Gallipoli full of cheerful-
ness and short of an arm and leg, last-week
rose from bed, whither an accident had sent
him, to marry Nance O’Brien, daughter of
the late Government medical-officer. Harry
is the Diggers’ representative on the Repa-
triation Commission, and his fellow-commis-
sioners sent him a clock to remind him that
the time is always ripe for good Australians
of his sort.
Genthelp Colin Duncan is back in Mel-
bourne with his bride, and Mrs. Duncan is
making women take notice of her trousseau
frocks. She had a cloud of dress critics
following all over the lawn at the last Flem-
ington meeting.
The Robert Harper widow has had word
from son Willie in ’Frisco that he and his
pretty American wife have given the world
a daughter.
Jennie Brenan has just returned from
ravaging New York, London and Paris of
new r dances, and Melbourne women are begin-
ning to sit up and take notice. Dancing is
as popular in London and on the Continent,
she says, as in the U.S.A. The newest dances
are glidy and graceful—like skating. In
London Jennie saw Ivy Shilling, her old
pupil, doing some strong dancing in
“Maggie,” which is a hit of the season. Ivy-
takes lier successes modestly, and com-
placently wears the loveliest dresses of any
dancer in the Hub.
Having had to leave its habitation in
Alfred-place to make way for the Naval and
Military Club, the Fine Art Society has
acquired portion of the basement of the
Federal Coffee Palace as a temporary abode
until its new quarters in Exhibition-street
are ready.
Twenty-four paintings by Louis Buvelot
were offered by auction last week, and most
of them brought good prices. A view of
Mount Macedon went for £lBO, and £5OO
was refused for “On the Wood’s Point
road,” which was awarded the gold medal
at the London Exhibition of 1873. Buvelot
was a Swiss who was over 50 when he
arrived here, but he succeeded in transfer-
ring many of the country’s beauties to can-
vas and gave his name to one of the rooms
at the National Gallery.

The Truth
about Temperance!
True temperance consists in the moderate and rational
use of the"worlds good things. The other day a
greai observer of the ways of mankind told us, in
substance, that what is wanted is not so much the
abolition of places were drink is obtainable as some
protection to the user of stimulants, ensuring him
against such of them as are unwholesome.
In solving the problem, “How shall we order our lives?”
no very deep reflection is necessary to arrive at one
conclusion. The world has an abundance of things
eatable and drinkable, some useful and beneficial to
mankind, others gravely injurious. Man is placed
amongst these things to exercise his discretion as to
what he shall use and what he shall avoid. Every
day, and perhaps every hour of the day, there is
added to his experience some lesson showing him
that true happiness is secured through the moderate
use of what is proved to be good.
surelv the discretion which is part and parcel of every
reasonable being should be zealously exercised in
tlie matter of alcoholic stimulants. The subject
really requires no preaching to establish its pressing
importance upon human beings. Even the very
slightest examination of the facts of the matter
should be all-sufficient.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
FOR
SMART
MILLINERT
The G.-G. and Lady Helen, attended by
Captain Duncan Hughes, were at Ver-
brugghen’s first lecture-concert of the new
season. Perhaps it was his Ex.’s presence
that led the Master to refer to the gathering
as most distinguished “socially, intellectu-
ally and musically.’’ A Beethoven posthu-
mous quartette and Alfred Hill’s Maori quar-
tette filled the night with music. Alfred,
whose wild locks are assuming an almost
American brush-back tidiness, was hauled up
from the depths of the hall to get some of
the applause bestowed upon an improved
version his Maori quartette. Lady Helen
was clad in pale blue satin with fichu of
old lace, and ruchings on the skirt.
The foundation-stone of the Girls’ Friendly
Hostel, opposite the University, was laid by
the wife of his Grace of Sydney on Saturday.
The silver tools used on the job, encased in
a carved box of Australian woods, were
handed to the lady afterwards. The G.-G.
had a few words to say about the value of
such hostels; and the vote of thanks he got
for his speech was so full of bouquets that
his Ex. was tickled into open laughter. A
G.-G. with a sense of humor is something to
be thankful for. Miss Wright, sister of the
Archgaiters, to whom the Girls’ Friendly
owes much, looked her delight upon the large
gathering.
While her G.-G. was showing his approval
of this hostel for girls, Lady Helen was at
the Jubilee x’egatta of the Sydney Rowing
Club. She went specially to present Mr. Q.
L. Deloitte, tl.e first captain and 19 times
president, with a framed picture of himself
on the anniversary of the club’s birthday.
No Mayor ever had a better appren-
ticeship for his office than Richard Richards,
whose premature death sent the city’s flags
half-mast last week. He was trained in
the City Surveyor’s office, and while there
went ranging the world for ideas in civic
management; then he crossed to Dunedin
to combine the offices of city clerk and
engineer; and he returned to take a seat
at the council table of his native city. Mean-
time he had married into the Booth family,
whose head had been a persistent alderman.
Temperamentally, too, he was an ideal
Mayor, for to his organising ability lie added
a large capacity for composing difference:-
with a genial personality. In the U.S.A.
tired of the slipshod management of civic
affairs by amateurs at the business, they are
getting into the habit of giving the control
to one or three specially-selected commis-
sioners. Were the same plan followed in
Sydney there is no doubt whatever that his
qualifications would easily have won Mr.
Richards a place in the trinity.
Once more in Sydney, Charles Gregory
Wade, his wife and their pretty twin
daughters. The girls did their war-time bit
by driving motor ambulances and entertain-
ing Diggers in London. Since the Armistice
they have visited some of the scenes of the
big battles, but a strike (how like home!)
prevented them from cashing their hopes
and touring Italy.
New Agent-General Davey Hall and his
wife are in danger of having their diges-
tions ruined, so continuous is the farewell
feasting. They are collecting some other
tokens, too, that are worth having. One of
the cosiest is a black rabbit-skin rug pre-
sented at a good-bye At Home at the Entente
tea-rooms by a group of musical artists.
Ruth Beale, who departed by the Megantic,
had a great send-off afternoon at Woodside,
Stratlifield. where the family abide till the
return of the Playousts. who own the charm-
ing place. Ruth’s stepmother and latest
sister-in-law (Dr. Hector Beale’s wife), a
pretty, slender Scotch girl robed in clingsome
jade green, helped out the occasion.
Lady Brown, the wife of the trans-
Atlantic airman, had to go into hospital as
soon as she reached Sydney. Dengue fever
was the trouble, and the party responsible
is alleged to be a Townsville mosquito.
Chaplain-Colonel King, 0.8. E., returned
to Australia by the Osterley. He left on
the Persic in 1915, and was one of the most
Dopular R.C. padres on the Western Front.
He went to Horseferry-road on promotion,
and while there was promoted also by the
Vatican. He landed in Sydney a Monsignor.
Colonel Barraclough is another well-
known Sydneyite who arrived by the Oster-
ley. Hje had charge of the Australian muni-
tion-workers in London ; and he had under
him as officers a number of Australian Club
friends. Notably Arthur Cox, who has
settled permanently on the other side, his
only boy being in the R.N.; and Cnarles
Bundock, who was originally in the N.S.W.
Remount unit
Returned last week with a Blighty bride,
Major George Wooton, D. 5.0., ex-Duntroon.
He was one of the brilliant young staff offi-
cers selected to take a continuation course
in Britain, and now expects to go to a staff
appointment in little Adelaide.
Pretty Gertie Down, daughter of a Sydney
architect will on Easter Saturday change
her name to Mrs. Snelley-hvphen-Jones and
become mistress of Wyangerie station, which
the bridegroom left when Wilhelm sent ulti-
matums to the King of Tonga and other
potentates.
Harry Russell Braddon, one of the trio
of soldier sons of H.Y., late Commonwealth
Commissioner in the U.S.A., was married
last week to Thelma Doris, the fair-haired
daughter of Dr. Fairfax Reading, of Turra-
murra. The Voice breathed in St. Mark’s.
The bride’s frock was simplicity in soft
folds of white georgette, the embroidered
veil pleated crown-fashion, with a forehead
band of orange blossom. There were pink
and wfiite lilies in her bouquet. Judge
Rolin’s daughter Phyllis and Elsie Edwards
attended the bride in georgette frocks of yel-
low tone, with a floral design thereon. Del-
phinium blue encircled their waists and a
big blue rose caught up the draped skirts.
Black fringe dangled from their black hats,
which had blue streamers. Pink roses and del-
phiniums bloomed in their posies. Dr. All-
port (A.M.C.) and Captain Gilder saw
Lieut. Braddon through. Uncle Claude
Reading’s home at Darling Point was the
scene of the rejoicing that followed the cere-
mony. After the honeymoon at Jenolan the
couple take up housekeeping at Cronulla.
London letters state that Dorothy Brun-
ton has been quietly married. The lucky
man is Mr. Nathan, of M.L., a cousin of
the very affluent youth who was engaged to
Molly Levy (the late Harry Levy’s elder
girl) for a while. Dorothy’s Nathan, who
has been asking her to marry him for years
(ever since her first M.L. tour, as a matter
of fact), does not resemble one of the
Chosen Race. He more suggests a good-
looking Irishman. He served with the
R.F.A. during the war and got badly knocked
about.
Nancy Isaacs was to have been married
yesterday (Saint Patrick’s Day) in London.
The marriage of Hilda Love, of Bris-
bane, and Flag-Lieutenant Lyon, of
H.M.A.S. Australia, is booked for the 22nd
of this month at St. James’s. Bride-elect
and mother are at Cromer while the trous-
seau-collecting is in progress.
This is the latest picture of Jane Mander
taken by a New York photographer. He lias
no* managed to catch the very happy expres-
sion Jane is
wearing at the
moment, due to the
fact that John Lane
has just published
her first book, “The
Story of a New
Zealand Rive r.”
Although she has
lived and done news-
paper work in Syd-
ney, Jane hails from
Maoriland, where
father had a paper
of his own and the
letters M.P. to his
name. Jane has been
a shining light in
U.S.A. Re d Cross
work for the past
two years, and is
still “holding down a job” with that organ-
isation. But she hopes to bask in Austra-
lia’s sunshine before the year runs out.
Itobed in white satin and silk net. with
a train of shirred pink-silk net. Muriel
Hopkins, daughter of Mrs. W. M. llop-
was married to Lieut. Keith Aird
Fraser, son of the Chief Commissioner for
Railways, at St. Peter’s, one evening last
week. The bridesmaids were Trixie Hop-
kins, in mauve satin and georgette'; and
Hettie Miller, in pink satin with silver
tissue. Black panne hats with silver tissue
made a charming combination with bouquets
of pink and mauve asters. Lieut. Little
(Melbourne) and Lieut. Firth Fraser sup-
ported the ’groom. The subsequent cheers
were given at Warringah Hall.
The last U.S. mail brought cards in the
American manner: “Mr. and Mrs. Robert
William Welch announce the marriage of
their daughter Catharine Galbraith to Mr.
James Francis Dwyer.” The ’groom is an
old Bulletin man who went to see what
Uncle Sam would say to him. He has
been one of the American magazines’ best-,
selling story-writers ever since.
The Connie Johnson-Ross Munro wedding
is to be celebrated at Sutton Forest next
Saturday. A number of the ’groom’s folk
have come from Brisbane for the event,
and Sir Walter and Lady Davidson are to
be among the guests.
Elsie Hobbes, of Cremorne, has returned
from a visit to India and Burma. Her
marriage with John Milne Thorburn, of
Nyaunghla, Upper Burma, will take place
early in June. The honeymoon will be
spent in America and Scotland.
T. W. McCawley,
who has been treated
by the Privy Council
as a matter of inter-
national importance,
is not yet quite 40.
He left St. Pat’s at
Toowoomba at 14,
made a start as a
Savings Bank clerk,
read in spare time
for the Bar, and at
29 became Crown
Solicitor of Queens-
land. Everybody ad-
mits that he was a
brilliant success in
the job. Early in
1917 he was ap-
pointed President of
the Arbitration
Court, and later in the year a Judge of the
Supreme Court; and then the pot boiled
over. The other Judges said it couldn’t
be done. But McCawley was sure it could,
though he must have breathed a long sigh
of relief when Isaacs and Rich, of the High
Court, agreed with him. However, the
majority was against those two. So the case
went to the Privy Council; aud what the
Privy Council said must almost make the
High Court majority feel uncomfortable.
McCawley will therefore take his seat on the
Queensland Bench, the youngest Supreme
Court Judge in Australia, and, though of
course he has to prove himself as a Judge,
he is certainly the owner of one of the
judiciary’s most brilliant intellects.
Verbrugghen waved his baton at the Town
Hall on Saturday before a full house. A
first performance of Tschaikowsky’s “Cap-
riccio Italien” (we heard some of it given
by the Sydney Amateur Orchestra under
Ilazon) showed the State Orchestra at
almost its best. Cowen’s “Adagio,” from his
Scandinavian Symphony, was another first
appearance. A tribute was paid to the late
and genuinely-lamented Mayor Richards in
Chopin’s “Funeral March” at the opening.
Gladys Macdowell, of Melbourne, a contralto,
was the successful song-bird of the concert.
During the State Orchestra’s tour of
Maoriland the conductor, ever on the look-
out, collected the Beck brothers, Haydn
and Harold, violinist and ’cellist, and
brought them back to Sydney. Haydn
(his family took a risk with the name) got
some honors at Brussels, along with mar-
vellous technique. His ’cellist brother
toured Maoriland with Harry Dearth lately
under the Taits’ direction.
Blest is the man who cuts his speeches
short. During a recent press tour, when
the country hosts had limited their own elo-
quence to five minutes each, an Inky Way-
farer got up and orated for 37 minutes by
the non-stop watch! Next morning his
fellow-pressmen handed him a round robin
decorated with a quotation from Shakspeare:
“Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back.”
At the other end of the oratorical scale is
shipping-knight Owen Cox. Presiding at
the recent St. David’s Day celebration, he
got off the shortest speech on record. Gov-
ernor Davidson was present, and the courtier
remarked that his Ex. was St. David’s
greater . son. Then he sat down, without
even firing off one of those wonderful Welsh
words that explode like sixpenn’orth of
rockets.
Flora Sandes, who is coming to Australia
on a lecturing tour, is a sister of Johnny
Sandes, of the Sydney Telegkaph. (He is
coming, too: he and Keith Murdoch are the
Australian pressmen on the Renown.)
Miss Sandes is middle-aged, spare of form,
and wears her grizzled hair more or less
short. She habitually appears in a Servian
uniform, with two silver stars on the shoulder
indicating the rank of sergeant, and many
service ribbons. At one period she actually
saw service in the line with the Servian
Army; but latterly she was at Salonika on
a base job.
The Ernest Watts have taken one of the
flats at Strathroyal, in Elizabeth Bay-road.
The house belongs to the Reggie Allens, who
intend to inhabit the top deck as soon as it
is ready. The old place belonged originally
to the J. O. Williamsons. Later the shipping
Mills family lived there.
May Gibbs has produced a delightful
poster to boost Baby Week. The Stork,
bent upon his noble calling, with a wattle
baby under each wing, and the motherly
kookaburra with her gum-blossom baby, are
a joy to all with a vein of humor. “I don’t
half like delivering the goods, Mrs. Kooka-
burra,” the stork says—“these humans are
so careless of ’em.”
Northward bound by the next boat for
Darwin are Mrs. Hogan, wife of the new
Acting-Judge, and her little English-born
daughter. Sister “Coo-ee” Davis goes too.
The Judge wore a major’s crown in the Big
War, and the marriage happened in Blighty,
Mrs. Hosrnn being then Army Sister Stella
Davis, of N. S. Wales.
Padre Richmond’s scheme to establish a
farm for the benefit of the returned man
who is “going down the hill” had its first
airing in the George Earps’ drawing-room
last week. General Cox, Colonel Farr and
others testified to the want, and the padre
talked convincingly of his plan for taking
hold of the men who are drifting. To give
the fund a start Mr. Earp promised £lOO
if nine others would do the same.
Fred Lassetter, the only offspring of the
head of the George-street Lassetters, dark,
slim and very carefully groomed, was called
to the Bar in Sydney last week. He had
already been “called” in London. On his
mother’s side he is an Antill. She is a
sister of “Jack” Antill, who was a Light
Horse brigadier, and is now Commandant
in S. Aus. Young Lassetter was slightly
wounded at a very early stage of the pro-
ceedings ; and on his return from special
leave was wrecked in the Lusitania.
The Union Club is preparing to issue
invitations to the first ball given by any
of the clubs since the war began. It is to
be at the Town Hall in Race Week, and the
idea is to welcome back those members who
served in khaki.
The matinee to be given at the Palace
for the Soldiers’ Entertainments Fund had
a good kick-off at a first meeting at the
Australia on Thursday. Mrs. G. Earp pre-
sided, and they discussed ways and means
of running concert parties. The Govern-
ment does not include the entertainment of
bedridden and maimed soldiers in its philan-
thropy, so railway fares must be found.
Hence the appeal, the first for two years.
The Cheer-O Girls, Taits’ panto, artists, a
revue arranged by Mrs. C. E. Jaques aud
sundry other attractions are preparing for
the matinee early in May.
Gertrude Rennie, who has interested her-
self in many philanthropies during her 17
months in Sydney, returns to Melbourne
at the end of the month. Many teacups
have been emptied in her honor.
Miss L. L. Armstrong was the guest at
the Women’s Service Club dinner this
month. She is its hon. sec., and has been
mainly responsible for its teething. Miss
Roseby, M.A.. was in the chair, and every-
one sang “She’s a jolly good fellow” in
proper style.
By the end of last week there were
precious few women in this middle-aged town
who hadn’t seen or tried to see the manne-
quin parades at Farmer’s. Crowds of women
rushed the seats an hour before the first
mannequin, unclad for evening exhibition,
strutted on the stage in the big costume
department. Those who, coming late, stood
afar off got fleeting glimpses of sleeveless
evening gowns, of still more gorgeous even-
ing coats, of winter coats and skirts that
always were more coat than skirt. Kindly
thoughts for the onlookers moved the pro-
prietors not to mark in the printed pro-
gramme the paralysing prices.
Do something towards earmarking the
night of April 16 and brand it as well
“S.M.IL,” which stands for St. Martha’s
Home, an orphanage at Leichhardt. It suc-
cors somewhat under a hundred orphan girls
solely 7 on what it can beg from the- public.
Well, on- the night of April 16 a Supper
Dance will be held in the Paddington Town
Hall in aid of this most worthy and un-
fashionable charity. The last meeting, spon-
sored by Sydney’s Mayoress before her
premature widowhood, was to arrange office-
bearers for the function. Write to hon.
organising secretary Miss Nellie King (c/o
the St. M. H., Leichhardt) for your tickets.
Mrs. J. C. Williamson’s pretty flat at
Ivingsclerc has been taken for the year of its
owner’s absence by the Adamses, the Yickers-
Vimy people.
He had just launched out in business for
himself and was telling his friend all about
it with the enthusiasm and high hope of the
early 20’s, pausing every now and again to
pass the condiments with a quaint gallantry
that smacked of the Dickens period. Pre-
sently he looked at the clock and took hasty
leave. His friend watched the erect figure
till it passed through the doorway. Then
he leaned forward. “He was a Civil Ser-
vice man and six months ago was super-
annuated. He started business for him-
self, and now he is trebling the income at
which he left the Service. I’m only 62 and
he was 71 last birthday. I’m thinking of
starting out for myself at Easter time.”
And Lion Heart 11. took his leave with a
quaint little bow fashionable half a cen-
tury ago. Yet there are those who say
Australians must always have a post to
lean against.
Bananalander pianist Cahill has been mop-
ping up success in India along with tenor
George Brookes. They had a special time in
Hyderabad, where they visited and played
at one of the most famous palaces in India.
The young_ Australians were amazed at the
Rajah’s IoOG servants; but the palace is
over a mile in length, so there is probably
enough dusting to go round. Fuzzy Cahili.
who is an Irish-Australian about five-feet
high, was not overwhelmed by the size of
his dusky audience, but pounded the concert-
grand with fervor.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT.
Your Directors herewith submit their report and financial statement for the year ended 31st Decem-
ber, 1919. During the period, as will be seen from the financial statement, the business has made
very satisfactory progress. The turnover was increased by £87,200/19/11, and the net profits were
£26,180/8/10, as compared with £15,131/2/6 for the previous 12 months. In order to cope with
the expanding business of the company, a further amount of £27,500 capital was called up bv an
issue of 30,000 Ordinary Shares, together with the third call of 5/- per share on the “15” Preference
5/- per share on tl/e _
issue. One of your Managing Directors —Mr. Pearson—paid a visit to London in order to buy the
requirements of the company for trading during 1920, and we are pleased to state was successful in
this direction, and the company is now in a most satisfactory position to cope with the trade offering
this year. The Directors desire to again record th e i r appreciation of the loyal services of the staff
and the employees of the company. The balance at the credit of Profit and Loss Account is £26,384/16/11
which the Directors recommend allocating as follows: ’
DIVIDEND ON “A” PREFERENCE SHARES for the half-year, at -the rate of
7 per cent, per annum
DIVIDEND ON “B” PREFERENCE SHARES for the half-year, at the rate
of 9 per cent, per annum . . . . . . . . ..

Every square foot of land is valuable
now-a-days—far too valuable to be taken
up by scrub and weeds. Why should
they sap the vitality out of ground which
should contribute to your storehouse or
granary ?
Have you a clearing problem—is any
of your land being usurped by undesir-
able weeds ? Then there’s no earthly
reason why they should remain there
any longer. You have a speedy, sure,
and economical means of cutting short
their existence.
"VALLO” Brand Weed
Scrub and Tree Killer
will clean them off like a bush fire, with
the difference that they go for good.
“Vallo” is not an experiment. It is an
absolute exterminator of any and every
kind of Noxious Growth. It’s demon-
strating its efficiency every day. Whether
your trouble be giant trees or common
sorrel put “Vallo” on the job and you’ll
be impressed by what it can do.

V.C.T. : That's the ABC of decentralisa-
tion : and if Tub B. hasn’t preached that it hasn't
preached anything'. And because decentralisation is
almost its pet plank it is going to curse those
Northern X. S. Wales people who are spoiling the
movement in that direction by proposing a new
State with utterly impossible boundaries.... Digger:
You’ve got a “practically useless arm,’’ and get no
pension at all! Tell us about that first. The other
is a small thing by comparison, probably a fair
thing... .’Varsity: But wlio talked about an umpire’s
obvious mistake? Not that writer—an inter-Stater,
by the way... .Nisi P.: Seems about covered by
another par.... Dr. N.: No, that “E. C. Cole” wasn’t
Elsie Clarice... .Longreaeli: The medical service was
good, on the whole; but the organisation was
wretched. There wasn’t one Australian “general
hospital” in England—even Harefleld was an
auxiliary—and instead of the Diggers being all
together under one or two roofs with their own
Digger nurses, they were scattered over the country;
while dozens of Digger nurses were tending Tommies
and poilus and Italians. Australia allowed itself
to be bluffed into this by people who wanted to
make better “Imperialists” of the Diggers; Maori-
i land declined.... Crab Apple: Yes; 50 words of a
language prescribed by regulation to be written as
dictated by an officer administering the Immigration
Act... .Tambo: Rambles and sags... .’D.M.I.. t
Bridget is a very dull person... .E.G. (Edgecliff):
There’s cleverness in it, but not enough... .Osb. E.:
Crude verse.... Auclay: Poor attempt on a subject 1
that doesn’t matter. .. .E.8.J.: Beery verse has too
many bad lines to the pint... .C.M.; “The Peaceful
Nihilists” fall down for lack of skill....'Hie
Moralist: “Occurrence at Manly” is tame enough for
Parramatta.... Reginald S.: Yarn about a deep sor-
row provoked by tlie tower at the railway station
moves us to strong dritik.... K.W.C.: The person
who couldn’t find his line, without that commotion
would be likely to have a clock-work soul, any-
how \.P. (Farnhnm, Eng.): No earthly use....
A.N.P.C.: Too many locusts. ... Boomerang: Part of
it deserves immortality :—•
1 would that 1 had met you
In youthful long ago,
Thank God, I still can woo you
With man’s fiery ego.
I'm joyed that 1 did not toy,
Trifling my time away,
With ooglitig maids false and coy.
Not waiting this great day!
. . . . J.S.N. : The skull verse is good, but the idea is
old and obvious. .. .F.C.F.: “Compensation” lias
merits, but not enough for blank verse... .Kayo:
Goes to pieces in spots, but some of it is good
enough to make it worth trying again.... Elonera:
William’s device is too thin. .. .M.A.S.: “Jim” isn’t
strong enough for that sort of thing. .. .G.E.M.:
Thibet doesn’t allure us. The looseness of the
verse i's too easy.... B.B.: “Lunatic” won't stand
that treatment... .E.A.A.D.: Parodies must be very
special to get a look in. Yours is ordinary... .
A.W.D.: Not enough in “Barrel-organs”.... 11. M.
(Subiaco) : Dreary preachment. .. .J.S.L.: The kid
likes the Devil better than God —a tolerably common
complaint... .Red Disc: The race 'wouldn’t be over
yet if they ran it in that slumbrous measure....
C.U.T.8.: Verse and prose both stagger into collapse.
... .G.V.S.D.: Nonsense lias to be better done....
H.W.S.: “Rulers” and “Poppies” must go back....
E.G.M.: Bad. .. . Rigoletto: Ditto. .. .T.W. (Aus-
tralia): Not up 0.E.: “Peace on Earth” and
the others fail \.E.G.: Mcßeid . isn’t a thrilling
ghost E.IJ.F.: Not well enough done,... D.L.S.:
The “Parson" has the charm of all the Muses and
a lot ol' other qualities:
But this one is a broad-minded one, sez I,
For he seemed to think
That it was quite enough
If a man gave up his drink,
At Bingi on the Ki.
And we cheered' him by and bye,
For this is what be said, you see,
That a man could smoke bis pipe in Lent,
Also sugar in his tea,
At Bingi on the Ki.
.. . .Marcus S.: Better grow up. . . .Raymond M.: It's
dreary... .M.8.P,: Won’t d 0.... Candidate: Misses.
. ...J.D. or Q.J). (Elstermyick) : Yes, there’s room
for improvement, though the line “With greed thou
seems intoxicated” is worthy of a sort of immortality.
. ...IT.J.E.: Rubbish.... Monty : Lean and wobbly.
. ...M.K.: “The Duck” seems to have lost some
of its feathers. It’s a mirthless biped, anyhow....
L.S. (S.A.): “Pursuit of Henry Lawson” doesn't
work. He can generally be caught in George-street
by a heavy person who doesn’t know the back-
stairs... .Hunt C.: Not very clear what’s happening.
....Koolawarra: You wrong a. girl in very.bad verse
and then go and live with her i Your plea for mercy
is under severe consideration.... M.F.E.V There’s an
idea. See if 'you can’t make a bit more of it....
Vie M.: Neither cats nor pyjamas can come in....
Paul Me: Sounds like a bit of one of Shaw’s own
prefaces and not much truer... .N.F.S.: “The Elec-
trified Poet" is not the thing he might have been.
. ...N.C.: Tlie unconvincing dialect makes the yarn
sound false... . G.T.H.: No use .to us ... ..J.C.8.:
People w’ o jamb their typewritten lines together like
that give themselves, list, in the weights....
Returned S. (T.ongreaeh): Send us your name and
address, will you? We want to talk to, you, .. .Spin:
No “If” about it now. It goes right in. ... . G.A.L.
(C'olqmbo) : Well, the argument at that end is only
a reflex of the decision at this end. There can be
no grievance, except, perhaps, the inevitable one,
and that will be eternal... .Curious: The Brr,u:tin
pays for every line it prints. If the par is yours
cut it out and send to the accountant, or advise
him of the page and date of issue.... P.M.: Both
two-up and Allenby have had limelight enough.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.K.: They are only suitable for throwing . out.
....Ted J.: Received your solemn warning that a
sketch is on the way under separate cover. We’re
ready for it. .. .L.J.V.: You’re still cooing' in your
cradle. .. ,'F.D.N.: Blink and Blank are both wooden
and their wit is sawdust.. . .Anon•: The flogging
drawing hit the basket with a thud. ... A.J.W.:
Laboriously smart... .W.T.S.: Your signature sug-
gests an archbishop, but no archbishop would do it.
. ...H.H.8.: A sad drawing, and the jest was worn
to rags in panto, two years ag0....T.8.: A’our vicar
who looks astonished is too flat. ... T. J.: Design for
a tapestry or Egyptian' frieze, evidently G.L.G.:
Two green travellers in .Norfolk suits can’t rest in
this paper. .. .Phil T.: The girl standing up has bone-
less arms. But struggle on : you’ll do better.

OUR DIAMOND
OUTPUT
again last year eclipsed greatly any
previous year. The demand was simply
insatiable.
WHY?
Because our repute for selling only the
best grades of diamonds was confirmed.
Because all through the war years we never raised the price of our diamond stock, although
values in Europe doubled. A\ e objected to profiteering.
Because the public knows that with us only the best qualities are stocked, but prices are kept to
the minimum consistent with such quality.
Because our expert knowledge, our best buying power and skill, and our great reputation are
all at our customers’ service. ' , , . . „ .
Diamonds will continue to rise for years. The demand is in excess of the supply.

best Remedy ever for Indigestion.
Whenever I have a big dinner at
the hotel or elsewhere, I always
have a Digestive Tabule afterwards,
and therefore never suffer any ill-
effects from same. Why anyone
should go about troubled with in-
digestion when such a Remedy as
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules can

understand. I can assure you I can
heartily recommend them, for 1

Thoughts.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN my dear love and I fell out.
I made a little song about
The difference ’twixt maid and man
And how the hurts of love began.
And then there came a ghostly sigh
And presently a whispered cry:
“Who sings the song I used to know
A thousand thousand years ago?”
And as the wise take pen to write
New maxims for our greater light.
Some Pharaoh breaking aeons’ gloom
Laughs through his wrappings in the tomb!

NINA MURDOCH.
An Unexpected Pleasure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE front door is at the side, and there
is a brick porch with two stone steps.
He was seated on the top step, em-
bracing his knees, a vague object in the
gathering gloom, but I saw that he had a
casual sort of a face, the features of which
were just thrown together, like discon-
nected fragments on a plate, and he had one
large round eye and moist whiskers. The
other eye was negligible.
“This,” I said, “is an unexpected plea-
sure.” It was not exactly what I meant
to say, but my office as carpet salesman at
Gumin and Tumbledon’s has afflicted me
with a politeness that might be classed as
automatic.
“’Sh, ’sh no goo’,” he answered dole-
fully, “she won’ le’ me in.”
He rocked himself, and made a low',
moaning sound. “Fer twenny year I bin
a good ’usban’ to tha’ woman, an’ now in
me sickness, me old age an’ desolashun she
won’ le’ me in.”
Now I knew why his whiskers were wet —
he had been crying into them for some time
pas:.
“You had better get up and go home,” I
suggested. I have heard it is best to be
gentle and propitiatory with commercial tra-
vellers in this state.
“ ’Sh no goo’,” he replied, with the air of
a man for whom the w'orld held no greater
calamity. “She w r on’ le’ me in.” He took
out his pocket handkerchief, spread it on
the floor of the porch, and curled up on it.
“Goo’ ni’.” he said with a tremor in his
voice. “Go’ blesher!” He raised his head
again. His large round eye was revolving
vaguely in the dim light, seeking the person
addressed, if any. “Sir or madam,” he said,
“as the case may be —Go’ blesher!” His
voice broke; he wept. “I was at peash wish
all mankin’, wouldn’ ’urt a lit’ pickled onion,
’n’ she said: ‘Getter hellenblazh outer
thish, you dirty loafer, you filthy, drunken
sot!’ And she hit me onner head with sma’
meat-axe —sma’, black meat-axe. She chop
a man’s ’ead about terrible. Shee for ’shelf.”
He held his ignominious head up for my
inspection, and embraced my arm, and
shivered, and said: “Don’ leave me. Don’
leave feller creasher to his doom. She’s
waitin’. She’s gorrer sma’ black meat-axe.”
I knew he w'as quite mistaken. I had
been married to the lady inside these' seven
years, and I w r as prepared to sw'ear in the
most solemn manner possible that she was
incapable of using the language ascribed to
her, and constitutionally unfitted for the use
of a meat-axe upon a fellow creature.
“You had better get up out of this and
go home,” I repeated, growing firmer. I
wished to convey that he was dealing with
one who, though disposed to be kind, was
not to be trifled with.
He resisted, punching vaguely at the at-
mosphere. “ ’Ome, ’ome,” he said, “there’sh
no ’ome now for poor’ lil’ Johnnie Collinsli.
‘Go, hang yourshelf,’ she said. Hit me nine
timesh on ’ead wish bo’l’. Nine timesh, nine
bo’l’s. Now I’m outcasht ’n’ forlorn.” He
piped two lines of a sad song. “Alone, for-
shaken, weary of breath, In rags and in pain
I’m awaitin’ my death!” Then he cried
again.
“Come along,” I said, stern with him at
last. “I can’t have you loitering here.”
He embraced my arm, his large eye sought
me out. “One lash’ ’quest,” he said. “Bury
me wish me mother. Bury poo’ lil’ Johnnie
wish hish ole murrer.” Then he hit me
hard on the nose. “Ta’ that,” he said- —
“robbin’ man of the ’feckshuns of hish lawful
wedded.”
I rolled him off the porch. I could hear
my wife indoors agitatedly calling up the
police on the telephone we did not possess.
I endeavored to raise him to his feet, with
the idea of walking him off the premises,
but failed, so, taking him by the feet, and
occupying his legs as a horse occupies the
shafts of a vehicle, I towed him along the
sanded path to the gate. He did not mind
this treatment but conversed with me all the
way.
“Bin a goo’ and true ’usban’ to that
woman for ’leveu years,” he said. “She
hash man on ’ead wish warrer jug—per-
fectly goo’ warrer jug. ‘Go back to your
swipers. you dirry tripe-’ound.’ she says.
Unnerstan’, my wife’s a lady, but she has
lapses. Broke lil’ Johnnie’s poo’ ’ead clean
in wirrer coal-shuttle.”
We had arrived on the street asphalt. I
deposited him in the grass-grown gutter and
left him there, complaining that, though
he had been tender and true, his wife had
so far forgotten the faith of a good woman
and the promptings of. humanity as to knock
him nineteen times on the head with a black-
smith’s hammer.
I closed and locked the gate after me, and
went indoors. I found my wife on the
verge of hysterics. The unexpected plea-
sure had happened along half an hour earlier.
T heard him maundering at the keyhole
and would not open to him,” Mrs. Titmueh
explained between sobs, “‘and then he fell
with his head against the door, and lay
down in the porch, moaning and saying I
was hitting him w r ith the house. I pre-
tended to call un the police, but he did not
mind.. He called me Agnes, and said I had
blighted his life. Then he kissed me
through the keyhole, and said he forgave
me everything, because he was going to
die under the pepper-tree or the lilac hush —
I could please myself which.”
I reassured Mrs. Titmueh. and she was
presently more composed. She has great
faith in me m situations calling for coolness,
strength and daring, dear little woman ! We
had the evening meal, or, at least, portion
r: it. When the sweet was served there
came a sharp ring at the back-door bell,
and presently the maid appeared with a
white face.
“It’s ’im again, Mrs. Titnnieh,” she fal-
tered.
I went to the door, intending to be very
severe. lie was clinging to the door-post
with one hand, and swaying about in the
nigh:.
’Sense me,” said he—“my wife! I don’
wan’ any arg’ment wi’ you. Shust give
man liish wife, ’n' call it square.”
I told him his wife was not here, that I
knew nothing of his wife, and urged him to
be gone before I sent for the police—one
policeman in particular, noted for his
severity in dealiug with such cases.
“She’s a lil* wom’n gold-filled hair,
ansherin’ to the name of Agoness. I give
you fi' min’ts to produce her, after which I
break your flamin’ jaw. Time’sh up!” He
aimed a blow at me and hit the woodwork.
With a low, long wail of anguish he lav
down, nursing his hand. He said 1 had
bitten him.
I took him by the legs again, and dragged
him into the right-of-way. He was affable
about it, and at the end of the journey
said: “All ri’, chauffeur, how mush ish that
I owe you?”
I went indoors. Within an hour he was
back knocking at the kitchen door. When I
appeared, he said : “ ’Sh all ri’, lan’lor’. ’sh
only me. You know me. I wanner drink.
I wan’ two drinks. One for me, one for
my frien’ ’ere.” lie laid hold of my arm.
and introduced me to myself. “Lan’lor’, my
frien’ Hob’son.”
I tried to run him off the property, but
he preferred being dragged. He lay down
again, and said lie had been hit repeatedly
over the head with a bread crock. If there
was a law in the land against hitting a man
over the head, his own head, with hi% own
bread crock, he would put that law in
motion the instant he was released by the
ruffians into whose hands he had fallen.
The back gate was still locked, still intact.
1 put him into the right-of-way. and re-
turned wondering. He must have fallen over
the front fence. Anyway, lie reappeared in
an hour. This time he whanged the front
door-bell. The girl answered. She came
to me, pale and trembling.
“It’s ’im all right.” she faltered. “He’s
out there wantin’ to light; you. He says lie
ain’t in no ’urry, any time will do: jist
suit yer convenience, lie says, ’cause when
he starts on you he’s goin’ to kill you.”
Sure enough little Johnnie was on the
porch again. “Goo’ ev’nin’,” he said.
“Tliish ish to a finish. You’re dirry scoun-
drel, you rob a man of ’feckshuns of hish
wife. You’re bla’guard and ruffian, come ’n’
have drink ’long o’ me. Go’blesher. ole f’l’r!
Go’blesher!” He then kissed my hand, and
asked would I mind his dying on the porch.
He promised to be very quiet about it.
“Wife’s druv me forth, he said. “ ’Appy
’ome’s all broke up; villain’s susurped the
love of goo’ a wifesh ash man ever had,
sooled her on to break poo’ head all to pieces
wislia a bo’l’. Don’ wanner live.”
He then started fighting me, and went
whirling all about the place, striking out
blindly and wildly, swinging, jabbing, upper-
cutting, hooking and ripping with great
energy. I remained on the porch watching
the battle, and when he fell, and was biting
his opponent on the ground, I seized his legs
and the cort&ge moved once more.
We had been in bed perhaps two hours
when the maid came calling faintly at our
door. “Oil, please, sir, lie’s there again,”
she said. “I can hear him in the wmsh-
house. He’s snorin’, and sayin’ his prayers
somethin’ dreadful.”
I went forth. It was perfectly true. He
had dragged out the contents of the linen
basket, and made a bed for himself on the
brick floor, where he lay, bemoaning his
hapless lot. He was still troubled about the
battering his head had received, and the
temporary loss of his wife, whose hair, he
complained, had changed color again. As I
was towing him out he explained that he
was a roofless outcast. He sang as I
bumped him across the yard : “ ’Omeless, for-
saken, frien’less, through this worl’ I roam.”
I could not understand how he had been
making his way back to my property, and
this time I determined to watch. Standing
in my gateway I saw him stagger up the
narrow lane, cannoning from one fence to
the other, and crying the faithlessness and
cruelty of his wife (the lady with the vari-
able hair) to the sleeping night. He disap-
peared into Free-street. 1 went to the front,
and saw him come rocking round into Birch-
way-avenue. He stood off in the middle of
the road, and with a finger raised in the
pale moonlight counted off the houses from
the corner. Then holding the finger straight
in front of him as a guide, he dived for the
front gate of the house next door on my
right. This house was now inhabited by
people I had never met. The new tenant
had only shifted in within a week.
I waited and watched. A quarter of an
hour slipped by. I moved along the dividing
fence, awaiting developments, and presently
heard low voices in the yard next door. At
the same moment two broad palings of the
dividing fence were swung aside at the bot-
tom. and little Johnnie appeared, or at least
some portion of little Johnnie. Obviously
he was not coming through of his own voli-
tion. He was being pushed through; and
was showing some resistance.
I sprang upon the fence. A tall, iron-
boned female, in a roaring carpet-patterned
kimono, with hair the gilt of which glim-
mered in the moonlight, had John down on
his back, and was deliberately shoving him
through the fence on to my property.
“Madam,” I said severely, “may I ask
what is the meaning of this?”
She looked up at me. “I can’t have him
here.” she said. “You can see that for your-
self.”
“But I’ve got nothing to do with him.
He’s no connection of mine. Why should
I be plagued with him?” I cried.
“And what of me?” said she—“wliat of
me? I suppose you’ll admit I’m entitled to
a little peace and quiet—a little sleep. As
for his being no connection of yours, you
need not tell me that. I kaew perfectly-
well who his connecting are, He is ray
husband!”
And then she pushed him through.
I no t living ip Birch way-avenue now.

GAPING GASH » SHOULDER
After Surgical Stitches Broke Away, Zam-Buk Draws Out
Festering# Inflammation # HEALS in NATURE’S OWN WAY.
NO wound will heal until thoroughly cleansed of all dirt and foreign matter. You can even
sew up a wound, as Mr. James Smith’s (whose photo is here shown) wound was sewn up,
but if it has not been purified it will burst out again in festering and inflammation. When
Zam-Buk is ajpplied to wounds the powerful antiseptic properties of this Balm immediately set
to work cleansing and purifying the tissues, out all corrupt matter, festering and
inflammation, and not until this process is completed does Zam-Buk proceed with the work of
growing new, healthy skin. Mr. Smith lives at 185 a Riley Street, Sydney, and says:
“1 met with an accident while skylarking with a friend. He happened to have a knife in
his hand at the time, which caught me in the shoulder, making a gash some five inches long down
my arm, which gaped open. The doctor at the hospital inserted six stitches in the wound, but
these breaking away I lost a terrible lot of blood, and my arm broke out in a festering and
greatly-inflamed condition and seemed like paralysed; in fact I lost all use of it. My arm
continued in this condition for three months, and as a last resort 1 decided to try what Zam-Buk
would do, having heard of its success in curing similar injuries. The wonderful powers of Zam-
Buk more than exceeded my expectations. The first few applications
drew out the inflammation, reduced the swelling, and soothed the
throbbing pain in a miraculous manner. I
persevered with the treat-
ment, and after having

The Half-Caste.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ril HE chief engineer stood in the bow
and spat into the grey-green water
below. A big moon watched the ship
from ’way above Papua, and a wet wind
harried the breakers that came panting in
from the Barrier Reef, lu the engine-room
was the only sound in tin* ship—the steady
chug-chug-clank of the two engines. To-
wards -morning the sky became an angry
glare in the east, and the glass went down,
but the chief did not care greatly. It was
the captain who was earing: it was he who
watched the mercury dropping, dropping—
slow, it is true, but still dropping—and saw
the signs which bode ill for ships not strong
of heart and stout of timber and brace.
The chief engineer stood in the bow and
spat into the grey-green water below. It is
a peculiar combination of circumstances
which can ihrow a five-hundred-ton tramp
into the hands of her chief officer and one
uneducated half-caste for an engineer’s force,
lint the circumstances had occurred. The
Tonquin never had but two engineers, for
her owners were of the saving kind, and two
engineers instead of three saved not only
salary but food as well. Nor had there ever
been any occasion when the two were not
ample for tin* work. A tramp runs on no
schedule; she gets where she is going
the best way she can and whenever she
can. Beck, the chief, and Andrews, the
second—where was there ever a tramp, or
a liner either, for that matter, without a
Scottish name in the enginl*-room?—stood
watch and watch, ami thought it little hard-
ship.
But. now here was Andrews tied in a hard
knot in his berth with something he called
cramps ( the captain was deadly afraid it
was ptomaine poisoning), and as much good
as a jellyfish as far as standing watch was
concerned. Wherefore the half-caste had
been called from the stokehole and took his
place every third watch. Beck stood eight
hours with four hours below.
The half-caste was lazy. He was a pro-
duct of Papeete, and was a typical happy,
careless child of his mother’s race, living
only for to-day, for the next meal and the
next sleep. Somewhere, somehow, he had
picked un a knowledge of engines and steam,
lie could throttle her down if a sea made
(he big slow screws spin like pinwheels,
could watch her water and her steam and
give orders to the stokehole with unneces-
sary pride, could pack a valve or oil a bear-
ing as well as Beck himself. He was the
only man in the stokehole who knew even
so much, and when the captain had a de-
spairing talk with Clancy, boss of the grimy
stokers, the Irishman indicated the half-
caste as the only alternative to putting into
Townsville.
And so Beck stood in the bow and spat at
the grey-green water below, and smelt the
gale that was coming and wondered sleepily
about the glass, and decided it was none
of his business, and spluttered a little of
his disgust at being shipmates with “a rotten,
stinking half-caste, Avho doesn’t know a
stuffing-box from a box of sardines,” and
finally made his way to his bunk, where he
turned in all standing.
Meanwhile the Coral Ocean was slowly
making up its mind that something was
going to happen. The afterglow faded into
a ruddy smoke and the moon was no more,
but the big seas chased the ship and bit at
her flanks as she raced along the fringe of
the Great Barrier. Every now and then a
little stratum of cold air seeped into the
engine-room, and it seemed to be the breath
of the Reaper himself.
And in the engine-room the half-caste, was
fast asleep. He was stretched out on the
seat, his head against a feed pipe and his
feet straggling along the grating. He knew
the captain wasn’t coming down, lie knew
Beck was asleep, and lie trusted to luck
not to be caught.
But ho was caught, for Beck came upon
him unawares, and kicked and cursed him
until even the lialf-caste’s ears burned, and
he cowered away from the chief engineer.
The chief reported to the captain on the
speaking tube, and the captain came down
two steps at a time, and threatened
the half-caste with terrible things. For
this was a man’s ship and a man’s
job, and short hands make ugly tem-
pers and hard work. This was no time
for sleep, and the captain knew it; but lie
knew, too, the limits of a man’s endurance,
and should he punish the half-caste now
there would come a time when Beck could
no longer keep his eyes open—when sleep-
ing on duty would be his portion, not with
but against his will. And then, if danger
leapt the rail and stalked among them, and
if the glass proved a true prophet, tin*
just punishment of one man would
bring death to them all. So the captain did
nothing but lash with his tongue, and that
he used less oaths and more big words was
no comfort to the half-caste.
It had been like this for the three days
In* had served. Something was always
wrong, lie was cursed and kicked, and
kicked and cursed, for something undone or
something done wrong, all the time. And
the half-caste grinned and thought little of
it part of the time, and sulked and planned
revenge the rest of the time. “What for
do they kick up such a row about it? 1
didn’t ship to be no engine-eer, anyhow ! I'll
fix ’em! Some day something’s goin’ to
happen in this engine-room ! You just wait
and see!”
And something did happen, but it was not
the half-caste who made it happen, nor the
half-caste’s idea of revenge. But let the sea
work out the story.
At eight bells, midnight, the half-caste
woke up, from habit, and was frightened.
There was a horrible sinking feeling in tin*
ship as she let down between two hollows
and staggered up a slope again, a horrible
murky, dripping nastiness in the air, and a
feeling of oppression about him. The half-
caste was frightened. He crept along, hold-
ing tight, until he got to the engine-room.
"What—what’s going to happen, Mr.
Beck?” he said.
“God knows!” said Beck shortly. “No-
thing but a gale, I suppose. What are you
frightened at? Want to come in and go to
sleep again?
“I ain’t going to sleep no more, Mr. Beck.
I just want to stay and get warm.”
"Get warm! Get warm! Why, you"—
And then it happened. With a howl as of
ten thousand devils fleeing through Sheol, the
cyclone was upon the ship. And ahead of
the wind, or with it, or behind it, came a
wave —not a swell, not a comber, but a
hundred-foot elevation of water, stirred up
maybe by the cyclone, but there, anyway. A
tidal wave by itself is enough to strike
terror to men’s souls at any time. A real
Queensland cyclone is enough for a big ship
with, a full crew to live out. But both
together!
The captain saw the wave just a second
too late. He rammed his helm hard down
and called for all the speed there was in
the port engine, and Beck jumped clean
over the high-pressure cylinder to get to
the throttle. The half-caste fell on his face
and dug his bare toes and his hands into
the grating, and held on for dear life. But
the effort that the ship made was not enough.
It saved her from utter destruction. At
a slant she took the wave and began to
climb, but a good part of the force took
her on the beam, and it was as if a million
tons of weight had been attached to her
keel. A shriek from the stokehole, barely
heard in the din of water, told of some poor
devil thrown against hot iron. The air
was full of water —in the wheelhouse every
glass in splinters; and tin* water washed
tlie blood off the cut hands and faces before
it fell away.
Then the starboard rail went and car-
ried portion of the big derrick with it. The
boom swung twice from side to side of the
engine-room, snapped the shrouds of the
mast like threads, and went by the board.
Now none of these things were vital; all
could be remedied, and with a mast or
without it the engines should do the triek.
The captain thought this like a flash and
was comforted. He did not know that, the
crash of the boom in the engine-room had
split the floor grating, that poor Beck had
dropped through it where it Invoke and
opened, that it closed on him and crushed
him as lie went through, and that his life
went out with a ehoked-off snarling scream,
too quick for the sudden agony to reach
full speech.
And in the engineer’s shoes stood the
half-caste. He was dazed. Things had
happened too quickly for him. There at
his feet, his head and shoulders above the
grating, his feet and body below, was Beck,
the man who had cursed him, dead of a fear-
ful death. The terrific motion of the ship
made his head swing back and ffirtli, a
horrible sight.
Slowly the blood left the half-caste’s face,
his knees shook beneath him. Sharp across
his terror-crazed brain rang the tube bell.
Habit was. stronger than fear.
“Aye. aye. sir!” he called.
“Full speed starboard.” came the word.
The half-caste turned' slowly, the terror
still on him. Then —perhaps it was merely
latent manhood, perhaps it was some
memory of great savage ancestors on Ms
mother’s side when the races of the South
Seas were greater .fighters than they are
to-day—the "spawn of Hell” grabbed at the
wheels and spun them, and the boat began
to turn. Like a flash he shut off steam
on one and turned on more at the other.
The fear was gone. The blood came back
to his face, and his knees no longer shook.
"Think the sea is goin’ to make me
afraid, hey?" lie talked to himself. "To
Hell with the sea ! No old sea nor wind
ever blown is goin’ to make these engines
go back on me.”
Every two or three minutes one engine
would race. The half-caste had to stop
it, and stop it quick. "Lose the screw
and we'll all go to Hell, sure enough.” lie
whispered. “What, would yer?”—-this to
the port engine racing her vitals out.
Whirl went the throttle, off went the steam,
and a sighing sob from the cylinders told
of the fact. The next minute on went the
steam, the cylinder heads pounded with the
blow, and off went the engine again. Thus
for three hours. On, off. 0n....0ff. ..
And then the final act in this tragedy' of
death and destruction. Strained beyond en-
durance by the racking, and possibly weak-
ened by the blow of the boom, a joint in the
main steam-pipe gave way—not utterly, but
enough to flood the engine-room with vapor.
Do you know what that means? It means,
if it is bad enough, that the men in the engine-
room cook tto death, the most horrible,
agonising death a man can die, and it is a
death a man cannot run from • for while
life lasts the engineer must stick to his
wheels that the ship may live.
The steam came not with a rush, but
with a whisper, and it filled the room slowly.
It grew hotter and hotter. Had an angel
passed he might have heard a half-caste’s
prayer—learnt in past days when he went
to the missionary’s little church at Tahiti,
lie would have neard a half-caste’s moan.
Had Davy Jones looked in he would have
slunk ashamed at the sight of a man, in
the pride of life,- standing alone and cook-
ing alive while tic whirled the wheels and
shut off and on the steam that saved the
lives of the men above. And every time he
throttled down the steam came harder
through the break, tilling the room, vicious,
seething, killing cruelly.
Half an hour later the wind fell as it
had come. The captain staggered rather
than walked to the engine-room to see how
Beck faredi As he looked into tin* cloud
of steam which came through the open door
the engines gave a shuddering sigh and
stopped. The steam was gone. Below him
Beck, shrivelled, crisped, showed half above
the grating.
The half-caste stood upright, his eyeless
sockets looking straight at the bell, the ring
of which he would never hear. One hand
was upon one throttle, one hand upon the
other. Then, as if he had but waited for
the captain to see that he had done his
duty, he sank to the floor, and his half-
fleshless arms encircled the head of the man
who had cursed him for a mongrel.
“Great; God above!” said the captain.
“The half-caste!”

Here is a Simple and Non-
technical Publication that You
Can’t Afford to he Without.
It is much more than a mere Catalogue because it
gives you
INFORMATION ABOUT SPARKING PLUGS
that you really should know— information that you have
been seeking for, probably, and couldn’t get. In its
40 MAGNIFICENTLY ILLUSTRATED PAGES
it directs you
How to Choose a Sparking Plug.
The Advantages of Porcelain as an Insulator.
The Advantages of Mica as an Insulator.
Why American Car Engines are better suited with
one type of plug, and English and Continental
Engines with another type, and Aero Engines with
a different type to any. *
It minutely describes the productions of
THE LODGE, SPHINX, REFLEX, CHAMPION, A.C.,
SPLfTDORF and RAJAH FACTORIES.
In short, it is doubtful if there is one such sjmilar Comprehensive Booklet published in the world.
To the GARAGE MAN it is a godsend. To the CAR OWNER it is indispensable, and IT IS
FREE TO ALL FOR THE ASKING.
Shall we mail you one To-day?

More wool clipped.
By using the efficient “WOLSELEY SHEEP-SHEARING MACHINES’ instead
of hand shears much more wool can be clipped. On 700 sheep this extra wool
amounts to a bale, worth £22/10/- at present prices. Thus a single clip of 2100
sheep will more than pay for a Two-stand Plant, and the equipment will still be
available for the following years.
“Wolseley” machines are the acknowledged world’s standard; they have won this position by their
reputation for long and true service and for the embodiment of all modern improvements, lnquue
about them at once from the nearest branch.
