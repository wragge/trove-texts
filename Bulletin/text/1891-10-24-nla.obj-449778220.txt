BUCKING-HAM PARK ESTATE,
IHEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform almost
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminently
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large—from ioo up to ISO feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terras are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-
prietor,

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1891.
Chaos.
Last week the league and covenant between
the New South Wales Labour-party and the
Parkes Government crumbled away, and
chaos supervened. The resolution of the
people’s delegates to squeeze certain demo-
cratic concessions out of the slippery bigot
who runs the New South Wales Foreign-
trade system was a risky one, for it involved
placing a certain amount of faith in Parkes,
and every separate individual who ever vet
put his faith in Parkes has been “left,” 'lt
also implied a firm conviction that the new
and inexperienced pffi-ty were a match for
the old politician in the matter of wiles and
dodges and strategy ; and Parkes has
devoted his whole career to learning dodges
—in fact, he has devoted himself so ex-
clusively to this one branch that he has
never had time to learn statesmanship, or
even political honesty—until, in his old age,
he is more devious and more unreliable than
a cart-load of serpents. As for Parkes’
share in the combination, it consisted in
promising everything under the sun that any
Labour-party could demand, and in so
arranging matters as to make it absolutely
certain that the Upper House would cancel all
his concessions, leaving him all the kudos of
being a vigorous democrat, together with all
the advantages of being a bigoted Tory, And
as Parkes needed the support both of the old
Foreign-trade-party and of the new Labour-
party to keep him in office, and as it was
essential that he should be a Tory to retain
the Foreign-trade vote and a Democrat to
hold the Labour vote, the advantages of thi
arrangement are sufficiently obvious.
# # «
The grim and ghastly jokes which, as can
now be seen, the old man passed upon the
Labour-party in the course of their connec-
tion were many, but the grimmest of them
all was perpetrated the other day when he
announced a “call” of the House for the
third reading of the Redistribution of Seats
and One-Man-One-Vote Bills. The “call”
was obviously useless, because, though it was
possible to compel every member who was
not disabled by illness to attend on the occa-
sion, there was no provision to make the
members remain when once they did attend
or to make them vote supposing they
remained ; and, therefore, in all probability
there would be no larger an attendance at
the actual division than there would have
been without that ceremony. It was useless
also because the third reading of any Bill is
almost always a mere formal matter ; because
the battle was already over, and the majority
in favour of the two measures was absolutely
certain. Moreover, the scheme was actually
injurious, because it was more likely to rally
up enemies than friends, for the friends
of the measure were mostly the youn»
and vigorous members whose attendance was
tolerably reliable in any case, and its
enemies were the old and crippled fossils
whom Parkes thus proposed to drag out of
their beds that they might create obstruc-
tion. Also, it involved the waste of three
precious weeks, and made it almost a
matter of certainty that both the Bills would
be left unfinished in the Upper House at the
end of the session. Parkes on this occasion
assumed the aspect of a toilworn patriot
who was dying at his oar in the desperate
effort to shove the democratic cause through
an exceedingly tight place, and apparently
the Labour-party failed to see that no such
effort was required, and that in any case he
was shoving in the wrong direction. It was
the sort of humour in which the ancient
politician delights. His inherent inability
to go straight under any possible circum-
stances makes this kind of joke particularly
refreshing to his soul.
* * *
But a few days later the Labour-party
furnished Parkes with another and an
equally biilliant opportunity through their
utter inability to understand the nature of
the situation. In the debate upon the Coal-
mines Regulation Bill, they succeeded in
inducing the spineless Sydney Smith to
accept a new clause by which miners were
prohibited, under a penalty, from working
more than seven hours and forty minutes
per diem, while on one Saturday in each
fortnight they were to be limited to six
hours labour, and on the other they were
not to labour at all. The one fixed principle
on which the labouring population of Aus-
tralia endeavours to travel is to limit the
hours of labour to eight per diem, and the
democracy desires to have this limit enforced
by law for various reasons. There is in
every community work enough under
equitable conditions for. the entire popu-
lation ; a nation of one million con-
sumers must be capable of furnishing
employment for one million producers if
the work is evenly apportioned, and when
an unemployed problem exists it can only be
because a certain section of the workers are
compelled each to do much more than one
man’s work in order to earn enough for
reasonable maintenance. It is estimated
that, under present circumstances, a uni-
versal eight hours limit for adults, with
restrictions against the use of child-labour,
will make the available work sufficient to go
round, and—until the improvement of
machinery or some other cause again deranges
the balance, and makes a further reduction
necessary—the eight hours standard is
generally accepted. Therefore it was the
business of any clear-sighted democratic
party to enforce this standard. The weary
slave who sits for 12 or 14 hours daily on the
box of an omnibus in the rain and wind and
blinding sunshine—the other slave who acts
as cook or waiter, often for 16 hours daily,
in the cheap restaurant where the leper’s
cabbage and the meat from the animal that
died a natural death are served up at six-
pence a head—the hard-driven “hand” on
the harbour steamer—the sailors, officers,
stewards, and the like on coasting vessels—
the hairdresser’s and tobacconist’s assistant
—the counter-jumper in the cheap and nasty
warehouse—the newspaper-reporter, whose
work is never finished by day or night—the
domestic “slavey”—the sweated dress-
maker, and a vast number of others are solid
evidences that the eight-hours system is as
yet only beginning even in Australia.
Nothing but drastic legislation can cope
with the evils of the gigantic sweating-
system which pervades the land in all
directions despite eight-hour demonstrations,
and similar advertisements.
» * «
The majority of these over-worked toilers,
too, are paid by fixed wages, and if their
hours were forcibly reduced by Act of Par-
liament, their remuneration, in most cases,
would remain the same. For the artibcial
superfluity of labourers would be imme-
diately diminished, and it is this same
artificial superfluity which keeps down the
pay of the hardest-worked members of the
community to a starvation limit, while their
hours of labour are kept up in an inverse
ratio. But most of these oppressed workers
have little organisation and no political in-
fluence, and either for this or some other
reason, no one—not even the Labour-party
—pays much attention to their grievances.
There was a strange and horrible fatuousness
in beginning the reform with the mining
men alone —the men with the great and solid
vote, whose hours are, in most cases, already
on or about the eight-hour limit; and when
it was proposed to reduce them even below
that limit, while leaving all the great army
of politically uninfluential twelve and four-
teen hours serfs to slide, the situation grew
still worse. And when it is remembered
that the miner is paid by results, so that his
own accepted principle was being violated
to reduce his wages—when he was rendered
liable to be fined if he worked the recognised
eight hours, which was another gratifying
feature to the subterranean toiler—and when,
in short, the whole reform was to be made
at the expense of the worker, and not at all
at the expense of the employer, the measure
assumed precisely the shape that Parkes
most desired. He was sick unto death of
the Labour-party ; his Government was in a
state of hopeless bankruptcy ; and when a
chance came to fall profitably, he fell. He
demanded the withdrawal of the obnoxi-
ous clause, and thereby he was enabled to
posture as the tri e and genuine friend of
the working classes, who came to grief
through defending them against (he tyranny
of their own overbearing representatives.
With much ingenuity and much skilful
management he induced the great majority
of his old allies of the Labour-party to vote
against him, that he might get away from
the wrath to come. Mr. Dirbs, the one far-
seeing man in the crowd—orthemau who went
right by accident—paired for Parkes —an act
for which that wily politician would probably
have brained him with much pleasure—and
had he been present in person he might
possibly have induced enough of his party to
go with him to block the old strategist’s
retreat Unfortunately a domestic calamity
compelled his absence, and Parkes success-
fully got away.
» # *
Parkes’ retirement is a picturesque act of
vengeance on the Protectionists and the
Labour-party, separately and conjointly. To
the former he is desirous of leaving his
gigantic deficiency, at a time when the old
loans are rapidly falling due, and new loans
are almost unobtainable, and when the un-
provided-for liabilities of the Works Depart-
ment alone total some £2,250,000. To the
latter he leaves a legacy of woe, for it is
almost certain that amid the confusion to
come the One Man-One-Yote Bill, the Seats
Redistribution Bill, the Coal-mines Bill, and
all the other unfinished measures of the
session will be hopelessly wrecked, and for
the rest of his life he will keep on explain-
ing how the vote of the Labour-party,
given in ignorance and blind con-
fusion, brought about the wreckage. The
occasion was about the only one
in all Parkes’s career when every
Democrat and every Protectionist in the
House should have voted for h’m as one
man. For it was necessary to make him
face his own shortage, brought about by his
own ruinous policy, and show to the country
the real consequences of the Foreign-trade
system, instead of allowing him to hand it
over—as he hopes to do—to his successors,
and to denounce it afterwards as an alto-
gether new shortage brought about by Pro-
tection. And it was equally necessary, if he
wished to wreck the One-man-one-vote Bill
and the other democratic measures before
the House, to make him wreck them bv his
own act, instead of giving him the oppor-
tunity to pose as the man who fell in defence
of a great reform because a Labour-party,
less democratic than himself, stood in the
way. Apparently Mr. Dirbs saw both these
points, and—whether by accident or design
his action was that of a profoundly
sagacious politician. Unfortunately his own
party declined to follow its leader and the
Labour-party had no leader to follow, and
the result was chaos.
* * *
There is no reason to believe that the
Labour-party knew the meaning of its own
action on this particular occasion. It simply
ran amok in the dark with an axe, and until
daylight came it didn’t even know what it
had smashed. It had no intention of block-
ing the whole of its own programme and un-
doing all that had been done with so much
toil merely for the sake of forcing the coal-
miner to work 20 minutes less per diem at his
own expense. There is no cause to believe that
it wanted to reduce the miner’s hours by Act
of Parliament simply because he is a great
political power, and that it left out thousands
of other toilers who are worked infinitely
longer and paid even worse than the miner,
simply because they are not any political
power worth speaking of. It had a general
impression that the one thing that ought to
be done for any labourer was to reduce his
toil, and it failed to see the utter folly of
trying to improve on the Eight Hours’
principle before that principle was itself
established. If the Party had demanded
that the eight-hours limit should be en-
forced for the miner, and for every other
labourer as well , male or female, voter or
non-voter, the people would have been with
it unanimously ; if it had introduced a Bill
to that effect it would have commanded suc-
cess. But instead of introducing its own
Bills, it always invited Parkes to do the
work fcr it, and then it had either to accept
his hideously impotent measures as they
stood or else to plunge about with incoherent
and chaotic amendments which were em-
blematic of its own chaotic condition. It
should have been its own Parkes from the
outset.
Close Up Your Ranks!
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE N.S.W. LABOUR
PARTY IN PARLIAMENT.
(Per favour of The Bulletin.,)
Brother Workers,—You occupy the most dig-
nified, the most potential, the most enviable of
positions. \on are not the ordinary represen-
tatives of the constituencies of a great Legisla-
ture—*you are not merely the custodians of
general public interests—you are not simply
the repositories of a tremendous public trust.
You are all these, but you share these repre-
sentative and those honourable functions with
a number of other men who cannot claim your
peculiar, your unique, distinction. You have
every prerogative which every member of a
British Parliament lias, but you possess others
altogether singular and exceptional. You are
the symbols of the Revolution—the exponents
of deep-seated wrong crying for redress—the
avant-couriers of the New Spirit—the expres-
sions of a movement which must proceed to
“ C.esar’s Column,” if it does not reach Pisgah.
You are the first among the nations of the
world—are you listening, the world ?—to be
chosen as the champions of a revolt which may
make as readily for the bliss of countless mil-
lions as for their degradation and their destru
tion. Accordingly as you spy out the land will
the countless horde of suffering workers chanv
that step which is now dulled with monotoii
and leaden with the misery of an unrequßp]
burden into the springing quick-march of exul-
tation, or—into the panic-stricken, retrogres
sive rush which would be but a form of suicide
As you spy and as you report of the Promised
Land, as you manifest the capacity, the
worthiness, of the worker to be placed in the van-
guard of the world’s rulers, so will you raise or
depress the spirits oi the great palpitating
human mass. You are not merely represents*
tives of N.S. Wales constituencies — you bei,.
the ark of human hopes !
* * #
For, look you, the eye of every worker of the
peoples which are called (in pitiful derision!
civilised, is fixed upon you. Your success wil
be theirs, your failure will be, alas ! theirs also
Wherever the industrial conflict extends has
travelled the news of your election. I saw a
letter the other day from Norway which
breathed a prayer for your success, and its
sentences, vocal with an eloquent tearfulness
are but the paraphrases of passages to be found
in the Russian, the German, the Italian, the
French, the Swiss, the American newspapers
The workers’ cry that encircles the earth with
one acute moan of anguish has taken a less
piteous note since that eventful June. Where-
ever there is a toiler crushed by the social
machinery—which is the figure we moderns
appropriately use instead of “ the shuttles of the
Fates,” which typified for the ancients their
grinding social forces—there lias been an un-
loosening of the stringency upon his heart, for
your victory is the augury to each of the new
life, of the new condition of things, and has
rightly called forth a burst of heroic emotion
It is something to have done this— something to
have lightened for a moment the universal
distress something to have meshed men’s
hearts over the “whole round globe” within the
subtly-woven filaments of one pure dream.
And that concentration of gaze which you
attracted, that impulse towards a brief happi-
ness which you generated, will be continued
you may be sure, till the area of the industrial
conflict becomes the area of industrial victory,
or—mark the alternative ! —till you are over-
whelmed with failure.
* # *
Should you fall, you will not fall alone. The
desolation of spirit which attaches to failure
will not afflict you or your co-workers in Aus-
tralasia only. Coterminous with the field
which your successes have covered, will be that
of your disaster. You must not fail for this
reason ; you must not add one degree to the
pall of sorrow which o’erhangs the world’s
workers, or one drop of poison to the barb of
their enemies' arrows. Your function is too
momentous, your responsibility too exalted, to
risk defeat. It does not always follow that the
main body of an army will be defeated because
its advanced posts are driven in or annihilated,
but failure in your case and under your condi-
tions will dispirit the industrial army through-
out the world. The Labour-party of the
country where Labour is best off gave us, it
must be assumed, in you their best. Your
defeat will be consequently beyond remedy for
a generation. Defeat of the champions is
always an evil which is relatively irremediable.
A defeat of a mere vedette can be overruled by
the onslaught of the main body, but your
defeat thrusts the main body into confusion.
The destruction of Labour’s elect will send a
throb of exultation through the veins of your
adversaries, giving them new vigour and im-
parting to them that insight and ingenuity
which are both the children and the parents of
successful conquest. But —it is not your
function to inspire your adversaries ; it is your
duty to dispirit, to discourage, and to crush
them. Your forces of inspiration must be
directed to your friends, and not to your foes.
Ihe former you will wrong beyond repair if
you confer upon the latter the supreme gladness
which will flow from your mistakes and your
failures. “Mistakes? Failures? We don’t
intend to make mistakes or to cause failures ;
or to be ranked ourselves as failures ! ” You
may say this ; you, in fact, do say it. You
have been very brilliant successes so far, some
of you think, and, perhaps, you have. Only,
if you have, then we shall have to modify the
ordinary definition of the word.
* P *
If you have succeeded, it is for the first time
in history that a fighting force has conquered
without a general. It is the weak conclusion of
many democrats that democracy implies insub-
ordination and disobedience, and means the
independence always of the individual; that
every democrat is to be another Hal o’ the
Wynd, who always fights for his own hand. I
do not say that most or any of you hold this
very partial opinion, but why should you act
in such a manner as to give rise even amongst
your best friends to the belief that, with you,
democracy means just that and nothing more?
Why have you not elected a captain or a leader?
Why have you not shown the first capacity for
leadership—and you, the chosen of Labour,
are the leaders of Labour—by at once manifest-
ing your qualities of obedience? No man can
rule either himself or his followers unless he
appreciates the educative force that comes from
a just subordination. When you, not bywords,
but by your actions, declare that the idea of
obedience is undemocratic, you simply con-
found two very different things ; Rulership and
Tyranny. It is not undemocratic to obey ;it is
only undemocratic to obey where the governed
have no voice in the election of the governor.
Privilege and caste are founded all the world over
uponextortedobedience, and, therefore, privilege
and caste have to be fought tooth and nail,
upset at the polls, or blown up, if need be,
with dynamite. But obedience and subordina-
tion which are voluntarily rendered are forms
of liberty, and convey the natural recognition
of a law which is interwoven with the very
constitution of the nature of things. You are a
party. The very name of party involves a
voluntary binding together for an end, and
consequently a willing subordination of each
unit to the principle of the whole. In the con-
struction of a party, you thus admit the idea
of subordination. Why, then, refuse, to go one


f
step farther, and exercise that power o
choosing a leader which is the very condition of
fighting? Whoever before heard of a party
ungeneralled ? As well expect a masterless
ship to reach the port as a party to win
without generalship. You are nascent states-
men, and statesmanship is only a variety of
generalship, of that calculation of forces, that
analysis of agents, that discrimination in the
use of tools, that adjustment of means to an
end, that balancing of considerations and con-
jectures, which every leader, be he the captain
of a road-gang or the marshal of an army-corps,
must exert. You, however, would be states-
men without the characteristics of states-
manship, soldiers who object to be led, seamen
who prefer to do without a guiding hand to set
the course and to prick the chart. When, in
the conjunction of human affairs, a crisis
arises it is always the single, the master,, mind
which evolves the decision and strikes out the
spark that ignites the tinder—never the
momentary coalition of a score or two-score of
minds. Now, it is peculiarly your business
to promote crises; you will assuredly fail unless
you create them ; where, then, is your man of
decision? “ He was great, especially in critical
moments,” said Napoleon of Frederick the
Great; “ and that is the finest eulogium one
could pass upon a great character.” Never yet
has a body of men been great in moments of
crisis ; it is always the One.
* * *
Where is your leader? You have not got
one ! Is it because you are torn with petty
jealousies of each other, or is it that you are
one and all convinced that your leader is not
to be found on your roll as it stands to-day ?
Are you waiting for George Reid to withdraw
himself from the aromatic influences of his
afternoon tea-parties at Darling Point, and his
gilded evenings at the Australian Club, to ask
him to place himself at your head ? Or, are
you deferring your choice till the erratic pendu-
lum of B. R. Wise’s ambition once more swings
in your direction? Reid is bidding as ener-
getically as is possible to a man of his
lymphatic temperament for your support ;
Wise is again permitting himself to indulge in
that maudlin academic “ sympathy with the
down-trodden,” which he has not will and back-
bone enough to transform into practical action
on their behalf. Are you waiting for either of
these sawdust-stuffed puppets of circumstance ?
If not, what on earth is the reason for your
refusing to follow the plain procedure suggested
by experience and common-sense? Why not
choose the strongest man among you for a chief,
whoever you may consider him to be, and then
obey him patiently, religiously ?
* # * '
Can it be that you are jealous of one another?
People outside your caucus-room say that it is ;
they say that you are split up into almost as
many cliques as members, that you have little
unity of purpose, and less of mutual sympathy.
1 would rather not believe this rumour, and
would prefer to regard it as an invention of the
enemy. But, what can I believe? What are
the thousands of your constituents who are
looking with anxiety and fear at the eccen-
tricities of your conduct to believe ? We must
believe something, and it is your duty to tell
us, if not in so many words, at least by a dis-
tinctly-defined course of conduct, what really
are the real motives which have led you to
ignore the demands of experience. If J ones is
jealous of Smith, and Smith jealous of Brown,
and Jackson envious of both, how can you hope
to gain that respect from your opponents, and
the outside public, which will be your strongest
weapon to secure the aims of your party and
the enfranchisement of the worker ?
# * *
You have not elected a leader, and your
policy has been incoherent, and your energies
diffused and therefore wasted ; you have not
elected a leader, and each man among you has
placed his own little detached ideas before the
House and the country as the expression of
Labour, when, perhaps, it is nothing of the
sort; you have not elected a leader, and there
has been no proportion in the exercise of your
faculties of speech-making, or essential harmony
between your speech-making and your votes ;
you have not elected a leader, and you have
burdened the records with petty personal ex-
planations and with questions that are out of
occasion and mal apropos. You have not
elected a leader, and you have sunk from
reformers into politicians. No true friend of
yours expected you to strike 12 every time,
but why persistently strike 13 ? That divine
energy of enthusiasm which was yours in the
glorious hour of victory you have frittered
away on a thousand trifles. You allowed
almost at once that magnificent flame to die
away instead of keeping it alight and adding
the fresh fuel to it of self-sacrifice and devotion.
Entering the House to restore its ideals, you
have adjusted yourselves to many of its con-
temptible standards. In this, it is true, you
are only doing what nearly every politician who
preceded you has done, but you were sent into
the Chamber to reverse old methods, abolish
old precedents, and to create the precedent of
remaining pure and patriotic when you had
every temptation to be otherwise. Distinctly,
you have failed up to now, because you have not
seen the necessity of subordination to one single
mind among you. That failure may be the
cause as it is the effect of selfishness. The
selfish politician never was patriotic.
* * *
Selfish individually, you are disintegrated as
a party. Want of cohesion in a militant force
when it is attributable to dissension in the
ranks is treason. Treason is treason always,
and cannot be compared, otherwise I should
say that it were the deepest treason for a force
like yours which enters into the conflict carry-
ing in its knapsacks the destinies of untold
millions, and not merely its own political
fortunes to be internally dissentient. Your
failure, as I have said, will stab to the
heart the worker everywhere; and fill the
worker’s foe with a more hateful, a more
venomous, pride. It will rob the universal
worker of his vitality, and increase the self-
complacency under power of his master. And—
worst of all—it will consolidate the masters as
nothing else could do. Your failure will bind
your opponents more solidly than your success.
The monopolist is a timid creature at the best,
and as he is a bully, you have only to
demonstrate to him that you have the power,
and that you can use it, to induce a cringing so
abject that there will be no name for its
loathsomeness. But show to him that, after
all your chances, you do not know how to use
your strength, and the cowardly bullying of his
past will be the faintest reflection of his
tyranny in the future. Be strong, and you
will make the party you lead strong, and you
may then calculate on the weakness of your
enemy to act as your ally. Divide his forces,
and you conquer him —but how are you going
to send the separating wedge home when your
hand is palsied by ignoble lusts ?
* * *
Try and estimate the strength of your adver-
sary, the capitalist. Look at the Banks —-they
are Ids ; the shipping interests throughout the
world are his; the financial corporations of
every gigantic centre of commerce are his
allies, and every foreign factory with its
colonial depot, which is called ‘‘ an importing
warehouse,” with its parasitical retinue of
retailers, is attached to him also. And, most
malignant of his many heads ! —the Press is Ids.
This is your opponent —hydra-faced, multi-
brained—and these are the contingents of his
armies. Then the Law is his, and Parliament
is still his ; and the Church also. He claims
the world and the flesh and the Devil, and, if
the Churches speak truly, God is his ally also.
So are your necessities, and the necessities of
the men who chose you, and of their wives and
children. The hunger of the artisan’s child,
and the vampire-need of the woman who walks
the street for bread, are his likewise. Now, to
this tremendous panoply of power are you
going to add your weakness, your envy, your
malice, and your uncharitableness? Heavens !
the heart recoils from the mere imagination of
such baseness.
# * *
Hitherto, I will proudly admit, you have not
been base, because I am convinced that, while
you have been weak, your errors have been due
to an ill-acquaintance with the responsibilities
of your position, and the conditions of a poli-
tical contest unequalled in arduousness since
the Reform Bill epoch. You have not hitherto
realised, surely, the magnitude of your task,
the supreme nobility of your opportunity ?
That excuse can now be no longer yours. lam
but a humble scribbler, and my views might be
disregarded, and no blame to you. Neverthe-
less, these are not my views, but the opinions
of many of your sincerest well-wishers and
fellow-workers, and you cannot afford to dis-
regard them, because that discontent with your
achievements, which my words outline, may
burst out into a sudden blaze if you give no
heed to them. I might, indeed, say that I
have a peculiar right to remonstrate with you,
inasmuch as I have suffered in the worker’s cause
to a degree that, I dare venture to say, none of
your number has suffered, though I am not, as the
cant phrase goes, “of your class”—as though
all workers, of hand and of head, were not of
the one class. But I lay no stress upon this
point—l prefer to speak to you as one of many.
Therefore, heed me !
# * *
I know how you are regarded by the men
whom it is your duty and your privilege to
antagonise. I know, too, how they regarded
you three months ago. Between the knowledge
of then and the knowledge of now, how great a
difference ! Then, they feared you ; now, they
despise you, because they think they have
drawn your teeth, or most of them, and those
of the remainder that they cannot draw by
political methods, they intend to extract
socially. They understand now that they have
only to conciliate you as individuals, and not
you as a party. They are going to conquer you
in detail, and their hopes of success a,re, I sub-
mit, not too sanguine. With a patience you
lack, with that subordination for which you
have a contempt, and with that tremendous
organisation of allies of which you own merely
a fraction, they conspire to conquer you—and,
I fear to pen the words—success will probably
wait on their banners while you remain leader-
less. That, I may tell you, is the form of their
calculation. They reckon on your remaining
weak and powerless, while you divest your-
selves of the cohesive intelligence of a general.
Parnell was as much the created as the
creator. You have not your Parnell, but
make him, mould him. The dullest of your
number would be inspired by your thorough
obedience and your enthusiastic co-operation
to mount towards the opportunity. You have
all the one aim; to realise it, you must have
the one soul, the one passion, and the one
method. If you remain weak where you might
be strong, then you will be traitors. In that
event there stands no pedestal of infamy whose
present occupants should not be hauled down
to make way for you. Close up your ranks !
Price Warung.

This list gives the Association away in one
act. The nation doesn’t consist of* squatter?,
importers, lawyers, brokers, and assorted mil-
lionaires, and therefore the Association isn t
National. It represents, on a rough average,
about 5 per cent, of the nation, and it declines
to take in a single representative of the other
95 per cent, because it is the inveterate enemy
of that great balance of the people. It includes
the members of the famous wool-dray proces-
sion, the Soudan-contingent gang, the Jubilee
howlers, the men who packed the so-called
public meeting at Sydney Exhibition, and
asserted themselves as the representatives of
New South Wales public opinion, and hired
bruisers and rowdies to bift everybody who
attempted to open his mouth on the Republican
side ; and in a general way it takes in every old
and influential bigot who has consistently
opposed every attempt at reform. It includes
every solid and apoplectic old rooster who
believes in flogging men in moleskin, and who
thinks that strikes should be put down with
cannon, who fancies that a censorship of the
press would be a good and noble institution,
and who would like to see all men who want
their wages raised sent to gaol for “ intimida-
tion.” And that is just how “ National” this
famous Association is.
“ Private Enterprise.”
Sydney D.T., on the project to furnish the City
of Sydney with electric light: —
It is to be observed that undertakings of this kind by a
municipality have a powerful tendency in the direction of
monopoly A monopoly at once checks private
enterprise, and thus deprives the citizens of the benefit
which always accrues from healthy competition.
The fallacy of this argument is seen through its
transparent skin. The here-styled ‘‘mono-
poly ” is in reality a possession owned by the
whole metropolitan population ; the “private
enterprise” and “healthy competition” are
actually “ private monopolies ” of the narrowest
and most hateful kind. It might as well be
urged to semi-Socialistic Australia that the
railways ought to be handed over to “private
enterprise,” inasmuch as they are a “mono-
poly,” which “ deprives the citizens of the
benefits which always accrue from healthy
competition.” Similarly, the same red rag
might be raised regarding water-supply, sewer-
age, main roads, postal carriage, telegraphic
business, etc., etc. The D.T. is uttering the
sheerest of bunkum ; for monopoly, when ex-
tended to a State, or a community, ceases to
be a monopoly and becomes a co-operative
business, in which every citizen is a beneficial
shareholder. The D.T. then proceeds:—
The scheme promoted by the Electric Light and Power
Supply Co., however, does not present the same danger.
It does not ask the Legislature to shut out the competition
of rival enterprises, and the Bill provides further that,
after the expiry of 20 years-a most reasonable period—
the municipality, if it sees fit, may purchase it. This
scheme seems to commend itself as the one most calcu-
lated to serve the public best.
The D.T. evidently holds a brief for this
“ private enterprise,” which doesn’t seek “ to
shut out the competition of rival enterprises,”
and which only wants to have the custom for 20
years of the biggest customer in the city—the
City Council —the customer that will use quite
75 per cent, of all the electric-lighting and
power which the city needs ; it only wants to
have that at a contract price, so that it can
afford, with private firms, to “ cut under” any
opposition ; and, then, it will boldly challenge
all “rival enterprises” to come on and be
squelched ! That, of course, is not a monopoly.
Besides, even after all that, the D.T. has the
gall to point out that the municipality
may purchase the Company’s property after 20
years. But has not the D.T. said that Corpora-
tion ownership will be a “monopoly,” “check
private enterprise,” and stifle “ healthy com-
petition ” ? If it is bad now, how will it be
good in 20 years ? Only in this way : By that
time the Company will have made its pile.
There will then probably be such revolutions in
electrical inventions that its works will be anti-
quated and condemned, and then by log-rolling
and newspaper influence it will sell the useless,
battered, obsolete plant to the city, and let the
people have the monopoly when it is no longer
worth having. The game is too thin.
The Sweater with the Halo.
Judging from present signs, the time is near at
hand when the cheap Salvationist must be put
in the same category as the cheap Chinaman
and the coolie, and be declared a public enemy.
He is fast developing into a “ sweater ” of the
woi’st description, and he is an incurable evil
because he is the slave and minion of the in-
fallible Preacher Booth, and at the orders of
Booth —who sees the necessity of keeping his
red-shirted serf all to himself—he is prepared
to sacrifice every fellow-worker Avho doesn’t
gambol behind the tambourine and wear the
flaring garment of righteousness. A fair
example of this tendency has just come to the
front in Brisbane. In that city the vociferous
race who scream for the Lord has started an
industrial “home,” or some such institution,
where the local “fallen woman” is taken in
and allowed to earn an honest livelihood by
washing. The “ home” is a bright and shining
advertisement for the Army, and its benevolence
in taking in the derelicts of the city leads to
much public enthusiasm. Also, it leads to
many public subscriptions, which is more im-
portant. The “fallen woman,” thus rescued
from the abyss, is worked at high pressure, and
her wages are chiefly food and prayer, and by
keeping the repentant Magdalene at the full
jump, combined with the subscriptions aforesaid,
the Army can do laundry-work at far below the
ordinary rates, and yet make a larger profit
than its competitors. Every mean and pious
so-called “Christian” harridan in the city now
has her work done by the “ fallen woman ” in
one or other of the industrial homes, and gets
her name up —by wearing that sinner to rags—
as a kindly person who patronises a charitable
undertaking. Meanwhile, of the old establish-
ments, which once supplied work and reason-
able wages to several hundred widows and
others, some are closed, and others have had to
lengthen the working hours and severely cut
down the rate of pay. It is all a matter of
competition, and the ordinary laundry, haying
no preaching, and no torch-light procession,
and no collection-plate attached to it, is worse
off, even when wages have been cut down one-
half, than its pious rival. But the cast-iron
Salvationist snuffles in a vicious circle, and sees
nothing beyond it. Work is scarce in Brisbane
at present, and life is terribly hard, and every
time the Prophet of the Poster and his followers
take in some lost female, and make her work
hard, and turn her into a huge advertise-
ment, and use her for a machine to cut down
wages, they thereby wreck some female who
wasn’t lost before, or deprive some other
woman of her billet and leave her un-
provided for and hungry. It is no use
remonstrating with the Army on such a
point as this. No country is large enough
to hold an individual who is answerable to
nobody save William Booth. The question at
issue is the old convict-labour question in a new
and aggravated form, for the saved female of
the hallelujah band is even cheaper than the
gaol worker, and she undermines an industry
which is already about the hardest and the
most unprofitable in existence, and as an addi-
tional outrage she is passed off on the gullible
public as a moral and praiseworthy enterprise
and an act of charity. If sweating is unavoid-
able, let us at least have the sweater without a
halo; the sweater with the halo is unendurable.
Bertram Everard, the young and well-to-do
man convicted of aggravated criminal assaults
on several females at Sydney, has been sen-
tenced to imprisonment for life—the first three
years in irons. Everard’s history consists of
one long and shocking series of such offences.
Several of his near blood-relatives are in lunatic
asylums, and that he himself is a crank is
evidenced pretty clearly by his previous history,
and by the fact that, though he had been in
gaol before for such offences, he committed
most of his outrageous later deeds in public
(and on women who were in the company of
other women), without making any preparations
whatever for getting away. It is, in one aspect,
the old case of “ Monster Williams ” over
again. It is also, in another aspect, the Colston
case over again. The man probably knew that
he was doing wrong, but he “ had to do it,”
and the law still pretends to believe that there
is no such thing known to medical science (and
to ordinary common-sense) as irresistible im-
pulse, the outcome of a diseased will. Everard's
case is one for a hospital or asylum, not for a gaol.
The pompous homily of Judge Fitzhardinge,
in sentencing to life-imprisonment and irons this
wretched satyr, was worthy only of the days
of witchcraft. It may be urged that it really
matters very little whether Everard be sent to
prison or to an asylum. It matters a whole
lot. When you send a man to prison, you
intend to punish him ; when you send him to
an asylum, you wish to protect him and other
people. That such a creature should be solemnly
put in irons is an outrageous practical joke.
♦
In Melbourne the other day a dishonest young
man was sent to gaol, and when he was in
prison his sweetheart endeavoured—contrary
to regulations —to pass him a note. The con-
tents of the incendiary document were chiefly
as follows ;
I will start to work as soon as I can, and I will save as
much money as I can until you come home agrain, so as
you will have a home to call your own ; and then, love,
if I do that vou will promise to leave off knocking about
with the fellows you have been with.
The poor wretch of a girl didn’t succeed, as it
happened, in smuggling the note to the bowled-
out creature on whom she had wasted her truly
womanly affections. The usual capacious
policeman stopped her, and lodged a
charge of vagrancy against her for the
attempt. Of course it would have been just as
much to the point if he had charged her with
bigamy and aggravated horse-stealing, or with
being the Kelly gang, or with piracy on the
high seas combined with unlawfully jumping an
alluvial claim—any one of them would have
been as much like the real circumstances of the
case as the other. But vagrancy is a handy
and elastic charge (especially as applied to a
woman who is doing her poor little miserable
best to reform a man) and it enables any police-
man to tramp in a general way on anybody
he doesn’t like. And on the strength of tins
charge a bench of remorseless jackasses sent the
girl to gaol for six months !
Sydney, people will tell you, is a I reetrade
port, and Melbourne is under the dominion
of a grinding system of Protection. In Sydney
the R.M.S. Arcadia has to pay £164 15s.
pilotage and harbour and light dues in and out
each trip; the M.M. Co.’s Polynesien,
£154 16s. ; the Orient Qo.’s Orizaba, £l7l 35.;
the North German Lloyd’s Kaiser Wilhelm,
£226 12s. In the year 1858, when small
vessels only traded to Australia, these fees
were fixed at 4d. per ton, and at 4d. per ton
they remain, unto this day. Yet in Melbourne
none of these vessels has to pay more than £5O,
and the service rendered extends over 50 miles,
instead of, as at Sydney, over, say eight miles.
In other words, Freetrade Sydney charges
three times as much for one-sixth of the service
—i.e., the Sydney charges are 1800 per cent,
over those of the protected port of Melbourne !
As pointed out by Mr. Keigwin, the charges
from Yarmouth to London —a distance of 120
miles, which sometimes takes a week or so—are
only £24 for a fully-loaded vessel drawing 24
feet. Why is so much charged at Sydney and
Newcastle? Simply because the “ Freetrade”
Government get revenue out of it. Ihe present
annual cost of the service is £18,333, and the
receipts £38,689, leaving a profit of £20,356,
obtained by a gross and insensate species of
Protection. What does the Pro-trade-I ree-
lection Ministry think of the situation as thus
stated ?

816 Macqu.arie-slreet North, Sydney, Oct. 21,1891.
M v Dkar, Moorarixua,—
Melbourne's indictment that Sydney hasn't any un-
sectarian gangs of women going round and chivvying the
lowah ordahs, almost makes my pen smile. You can’t
open your umbrella in Sydney—especially on a Monday—
without spitting a member of this, that, and the other
society on it, who greets you with a heavenly expression,
and her hands full of flowers, or tracts, or food, or old
women’s petticoats. The place is literally alive with
them. They scurry down the Block—that popular
thoroughfare seems to he the way to everywhere, some-
how—about 2 p.m. attractively gnt-np and not humping
more “comforts” than are compatible with a stylish
outline against the horizon, and delve off in all directions
to tiie dwellings of the “pooah.” I went with one of
them one day and was greatly edified with the result.
There was a lot of pious snuffling and “Gord” (though,
by the way, I shouldn't put it in turned commas since
Lady J. pronounces it so) was praised in a loud voice
■ when a pound of tea or a flannel garment was handed
out ; hut, as a rule, the good little hooks and the nose-
gays were tolerated in a resigned, hurt sort of way which
w ould have withered all my philanthropy on the spot- had
I been the donor. No “ organised ” feminine poor-rangers
in Sydney! All one’s fingers and toes aren’t numerous
enough to add up only the tabby societies on.
More of it! It is cabled that “ The marriage was cele-
brated to-day (14th inst.) of Miss Ida Lee, daughter of
Mr. George Lee, of Bathurst, N.S.W., with Mr. Charles
Marriott.” All the well-known plans and specifications of
the happy woman, but just the bald visiting-card label of
the happy man ! As a matter of useful fact the excite-
ment ought to he all the other way. Antipodean society
generally knows all about the Lidy from her first Loth
np’ards, and all the curiosity is as to “Who” she has
married. In the present case there are fears that she lias
thrown herself away on the Charles Marriott who was
wont to compose discordant dance-music (for ladies’
fashion-papers) at half-a-guinea a sheet.
One looks for sucli remarks from the lady contributors
to alleged democratic daily papers, who all generally
exhibit symptoms of dying to he English, hut you hardly
expect the sports in the sporting column of Sydney D.T.
to dub so-and-so the “sporting squire.” There are no
squires in Australia, as lots of people deeply deplore ; also,
no rustics to hang on their forelocks and run like hares to
open the gate to let “ t' squoire ” through. What joy it
would mean for some people—especially for some women
if a race arose of little territorial tin-gods with a genuine
chawbacon following, instead of these horrid “hands”
who have to be politely entreated to let down a slip-rail!
It is deeply interesting to learn, amidst the eagerness
shown by local O.M.G.’s and such-like decorated cattle to
hang their little tin-pot stars and ribbons and tinsel all
over their puffy persons whenever the ghost of an oppor-
tunity offers—that top-grit at ’Ome rather shies at
“honours” which only mean a big milliner's bill to the
unhappy recipient, and tries only to merit some cheap
and undressy titular favour which it can carry about in
an ordinary tail-coat. Indeed, such a horror of the two-
penny-coloured has seized upon the Hot Tong, that, on
dit. more than one earl hasn't git a real coronet in the'
whole stretch of his wardrobe, and would have to balance
a “slop” circlet if life were ordered suddenly to turn-out
in full ceremonious fig.
Talking about “ honours,” 1 hear that it is not only the
lovely effect of the star against pa’s white-shirt buzzum
that makes such distinctions hankered after by the
leaders of local sassiety— it is said that there is a per-
centage on the house-bills in it to a smart woman who
knows how to cheese-pare with shopkeepers even though
their barouche waits outside. One Australian gang,
recently abased to a knighthood and without much spot
cash to carry on the “ honours,” sent notices to all their
tradespeople setting forth that the benefit of Lady Blank’s
patronage ought to mean a reduction of so much in the
pound, especially as Lady Blank would always recom-
mend, i:c. I don’t know if the tradespeople “ bit," hut
ever since this anecdote has been in circulation 1 have
gazed obliquely at the fashionable lady who is so anxious
to tell you that Grubhins fitted out her drawing-room—
so moderately, too ; or that Miss Filoselle fitted the dress
you admire so much : you really ought to try Filoselle.
If you mention my name, &c. It is then that the worldly-
wise wink their other eye.
Sometimes May and December matches turn out a
winning speculation for the lady—which is when the
gilded groom goes under in short order. An instance
happened in Sydney very recently when a used-up,
dissipated, old money-hugger married a sweet confiding
innocent of 20, and then suddenly demised after four
weeks of connubial elysium, leaving his disconsolate
relict £30,000 hard cash, and some houses and things.
That is the very happiest denouement for a Mammon
marriage, because, you see, when old men marry young
wives they often adore them for six months or so while
wifey is fresh to the collar and on her best behaviour, but
sometimes after that they commence to fix their faded
eye suspiciously on a possible Petrarch, and the result is
a harrowing codicil leaving Mary Jane 30s. a week as the
reward of her spirited matrimonial spec., while the big
sum goes to raise a home for lost dogs, or a Sunday-
school.
Sydney Ladies’ Sanitary Association was deeply
interested the other week in Dr. F. A. Bennett's lecture
on the skin and hair, and if he hadn’t generalised so
much he could have raised up a Bennett cult there and
then. One thing he said was that he would show the
causes of-blushing, at which the whole crowd sat up—to
learn how to manage their vaso-motor nerves. But you
could have heard a hair drop when the learned man went
on to paints and powders (by *’ way I had a notion that
.1 could tell who was—er—renovated and who wasn’t when
the doctor was speaking about makes-up—the first-
named dropped their eyes, and sometimes their ears
turned red- the behaviour of the others was normal),
saying that, although he didn't advocate the use of paints
and powder, “some kinds didn't materially injure the
face or complexion ’’-—which was vastly encouraging, only
that he didn’t specify t’other from which, and therefore
patched loveliness was as far off the hygienic track as
ever.
And this is just where I come in. The other day (in the
public interest alone, mind you) I interviewed the medi-
cine man and implored him to tell me what was really the
safest way to put on the poaches and cream? and he
said: “ All powders, if used excessively, pit the skin, hut
otherwise no harm results from powders made of finely-
powdered rice, starch, wheat, flour, Indian corn, orris-
root, from the vegetable world ; while harmless minerals
are line oxide of zinc, horacic acid, bismuth and silicate
of magnesia. As for paints, one ought to he careful what
■ one uses for fear of blood-poisoning, hut two of the most
harmless pigments are the sediment resulting firm the
action of spirits of lavender on talc, making a good white
paint, and pure carmine for red colouring.” Now, oh my
sisters, that you have counsel's opinion on the breathless
subject, don't steep your dear little ncses in French pink
powders, nor your cheeks in Chinese rouge any more,
please!
But, talking about face-lectures, they're rather waste
enthusiasm, after all. No amount of scientific combing
and brushing and sponging will ever make the average
Aiistralieiine the bright, firm-cheeked, cherry-ripe sort of
darling one calls the “ English type,” and meets locally,
now and again only, in some parts of New England and
Tasmania. Our sapless cheeks, alas ! are the fault of our
dragging climate—not because we don’t tub regularly
and curry-comb our faces religiously upwards from chin
to cheek-bone in an unflagging endeavour to rub the
wrinkles out.
One hardly grows emotional over the fact that Lady
Galloway will leave England in the autumn (now) on her
visit to Lady Jersey, because in connection with La/y J,
at least, Lady 6. is a sort of titled Mrs. ’Arris. She was
supposed to accompany Lady J. on her trial trip, hut
didn't, although the “fact” was duly cabled and every-
body expected to see two bonnets come over the border.
By the way, Lady J. seems to be a self-reliant personage
who doesn’t want an imported female to help her bear up
under an Australian accent, or to sit side by side in the
theatres and to mystify outsiders as to which of’em is
’er. Australia will he glad to see Lady Galloway—so long
as she doesn’t bring along Lord Galloway, whose reputa-
tion has preceded him.
Melbourne seems to possess more attractions for the
roving female relatives of its Governor than Sydney docs
in a similar way. Just compare. Gov. Hopetoun has
had his wife’s sister, his own two sisters, and now his
cousin, Lady Willoughby, to cheer his exile. Carington
brought his wife’s sister out when he came, but no other
sister, cousin or aunt followed in her footsteps or was
lured by her tale, and no lady relative of Lord Jersey has
so far showed signs of bounding over the deep bine sea
Australia-wards. Can this vice-regal female predeliction
for Colllns-street mean that the fatal fascinations of the
Victorian Johnnie are getting an English reputation ?
The State schools held their annual concerts at Sydney
Town Hall on 12th and 13th inst., but I denied myself the
pleasure of attending, perhaps because the magnetic
Lady J. didn’t go, and the attraction was lacking. Any-
way, a mob of over-dressed infants yelling Lady Jersey’s
poetry set to music docs not soothe the savage scrihess,
and the spectacle of excited parents in the audience
exchanging handkerchief waves with their darlings on
the platform so depressed me last year that I didn't
repeat the experiment this. But I had the felicity of
coming home in the tram with six of the performers the
other night. Four of the six were visibly rouged, and one
was lightly lead-pencilled round the eyelids, yet none
were over fifteen years of age. All behaved badly,
giggling and crowding and mouthing and signalling to
male companions in the smoking-car. Two whispered
together with girlish titterings, and the display of faded
roses, at the end of which the listener loudly remarked :
“ But, Cis, he’s ma-a-rried but “ Cis,” who looked four-
teen, only carried her confidences still further. Now, I
do not blame these girls for their conduct, since they
were let loose after the excitement of a concert to find
their own way home, hut one does feel surprised at
“parents and guardians,” as the circulars say, not think-
ing it worth their while to sheep-dog their charges on
such occasions. However, a mother who could let her
young daughter paint up would hardly object if the whole
world was shocked at her antics afterwards.
V.R. night at the Royal last Saturday was rather wet'
blanketed by the absence of the two leading ladies of the
occasion—Farren through indisposition in the ankle, and
Lady JerseyUrom a se -ions attack of staying away.
Nevertheless, H.E. was there, ciceroning a male party of
three, squired by Chumley. Ethel Blenheim took Barren's
part. What would happen if Ethel got the influenza
is difficult to foresee, as she seems to he understudy to
the whole crowd, and took Sylvia Grey’s role the other
evening when that divinity (who has an unpleasant trick
of turning her hack on the audience, by the way) was
chained to her downy couch. The whirligig went well, as
usual, Ethel only having to be told to knock Leslie’s hat
off in the last act ; also, the tarantula-legged Storey has
to kick higher to get his slim, pink limbs over this
Cinder's head in the dance-duet, since Ethel is taller than
Nellie. The jokes seem to he wearing well, and the point
is never lost on a tram-haunting public when Danhy
explains, rs lie tries to light his pipe in the girl-filled
schoolroom, “I thortit was a smokin’ compartment!”
Myra- Kemble has had .a good time up North with “ Dr.
Bill,” frizzled by the climate, hut, as a set-off, pelted with
bouquets from ecstatic crowds, some of whom brought
and labelled their own chairs, ready. Not only bouquets
were thrown, hut, at Charters Towers, an admirer threw
a bundle of 100 paid-up shares in a new mine to Myra, who
is seen off by admiring crowds every time she strikes
camp. Only one untoward incident has so far occurred
on the trip. On board a tender in Keppel Bay the deck
awning blew down and brought a big oil-lamp with it, and
if Myra hadn’t given an agile skip and fallen on her face,
her funeral would very likely have occurred last week.
As it was, she was rescued smiling like a seraph from
among the wreck of tarpaulin. A Brisbane season with a
week of “Jane,” and then overland to Newcastle is the
future plan of chain—l mean campaign.
Western and Illawarra Suburban Cottage Hospitals’
Inaugural hall (my pen is almost out of breath) took place
in Sydney Town Hall, on 10th instant,' with Lord and
Lady Jersey as patron saints, on a dais handsomely
fitted-up (gratis) as a drawing-room by Wallach Bros.
Otherwise there wasn’t any decoration, hut the lots of
pretty millinery, and a few red-haired men, also a brace
or so of “Johnnies” whose button-holes embraced four
red roses or enough primroses to cover a sqpp-plate, did
the lighting-up business very well.’ Lady Jersey—both
she and His Excellency darnced two sets of larncers—was
not a chromatic success in a blue brocade made an inch
too short frontally, the front chequered in gold, and the'
bodice caught with brooches of blue forget-me-nots,
because on the shoulder and down the side of the skirt
were clusters of wisteria, though why the lady didn’t
make it forget-me-nots and bo in harmony isn’t visible to
the naked eye of faith. Then the presentation bouque
was tied with flaming red ribbons, which added another
colour to the gown and blue satin shoes, and altogether
' “M. E. Jersey ” wasn’t looking her best. On the dais were
Mrs. Carruthers, in cream satin brocade festooned with
cream erfipe daintily threaded with pale-blue and pink
ribbons; and Dr. and Mrs. Read—the latter wearing a
yellow gown. Another handsome yellow dress was Mrs.
Spalding's yellow faille trimmed with flowers of matching
chiffon ; her step-daughter in cream brocade and chiffon ;
Mrs. A. J. Riley wore white brocade and a pink rose in
her hair ; Mrs. 11. Copeland, in white corded silk trimmed
with chiffon ; Mrs. Dransfleld, in black corded silk, real
• lace and diamonds. The prettiest girl in the room wore
mauve and yellow and a big posy, hut the electric-light
acting on the-hem —facial reviver made her cheeks the
colour of her gown. Another charmer in heliotrope had
a bunch of artificial heliotrope pinned at the hack on the
end of a long bodice, and I did so want to see her sit
down. Floor, music, and refreshment were good, and
the dance-card lasted well into the next morning. Alto-
gether, Mr. F. J. Llewelyn (who worked up the show) is
to he congratulated on the success attained by him and
his quartette of colleagues. If the pecuniary aspect is
also satisfactory the W. and 1.5.C.T1. hall will become
annual.
On 12t!i inst., at Brisbane, Thomas Hood Wyn, manager
of tiie tj. N. Bank, Gympie, Q., was married to Miss May
Winifred Tozer, eldest daughter of Colonial Secretary
Tczer. The ceremony required the services of two
Anglican clergymen, seven bridesmaids, one best-man,
and four groomsmen, with the usual after-purgatory of a
drjetmer. Honeymoon in Melbourne and Tasmania.
The funniest trades-union I ever heard of is theassocia-
tion of “upper female servants” of the wealthy people
of Polls and Darling Points, Sydney. The membership
consists of 40 or thereabouts, and is exclusively composed
of the domestics of “ kerridge families.” The minimum
wage is £1 a week, and they always get it. One of
the conditions of membership is an obligation not to
accept service except with a family that keeps a
footman and a carriage and pair, and consequently the
household which can only boast a livery-stable brougham
and screw is utterly beyond the pale. The most material
part of the organisation is that when a member is out of a
“ place” through the family going “ home” or removal to
the country, or when she wants a holiday, the other
members pay for her hoard and residence for a specified
time at a house in Darlinghurst, kept by an old-time
retaiew of one of the first families.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The stock salesmen and butchers of
Sydney tastefully suggested Rookwood Reforma-
tory-grounds as a site for the proposed new

A daily newspaper correspondent relates
of Dr. Gordon, erst of Murrurundi, N.S.W., that
lie once rode 112 miles cn one horse in 11 hours. It
was a common thing for him to bo called 50, 00,
80 and 100 miles to attend patients. On one
occasion the doctor rode 27 miles in Ih. 25min.

The Mayor of Ballarat refuses to allow the
Salvation Army to parade its streets. He says
be “cannot find any general named Booth on the

For pre-eminent excellence of composi-
tion, Marshall's Tonic Nervine was awarded the
gold medal against all competition at the. great

properties.
Ad. from a Tasmanian paper :
I beg to return thanks, combined with sincerity, for
the able manner in which my neighbours, including ladies
and gentlemen, tried to protect my interest, combined
with a lady from Bream Creek, to secure a portion of
furniture and other effects destroyed by a recent fire at
Dunally, when the hotel, viz., the Dunally Hotel was, on
the sth of September, burned down.
The Bulletin notes with considerable
regret that Edmund Barton is not going to be the
new Premier of N.S.W. It doesn’t suppose for a
moment that Barton would be so good a Premier
as Dibbs, but it wanted to try how his bland
countenance would go in a picture. Barton’s
frontispiece is large and hairless, and The Bulle-
tin artist, who has been drawing Parkes so long,
said that he really wanted to have a turn at a
clean-shaven man for the sake of a little rest and
variety.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabetli-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEV SHOWS FOII COMING WEEK.
Criterion' “Society.”
Theatre Royal “Gaiety Co.”
Her Majesty's “ The Dancing Girl.”
Garrick "The Librarian.”
Theatrical business in Sydney is at a very
low ebb just now, and “The Dancing Girl,” so
far, has not occasioned a flood-tide at Her
Majesty’s pay-boxes. This play might, on the
whole, be more fitly called “The Preaching Girl,”
for Sybil makes much more use of her tongue than
does Drusilla of her feet. It is a well-written
drama, but asks its audiences to take too much
on trust. “The wicked duke” is disappointing,
because he gives no outward evidence of turpitude.
Further, the story is occasionally infested with
soliloquy, chiefly on the part of the noble idiot,
and invariably weighted down with dialogue!
Likewise, the lame girl seems to have been intro-
duced only to haunt thefootsteps of the peer, while
whispering in his aristocratic auricle broken-backed
allegories concerning “horses’hoofs” and “broken
bowls.” The bowl—an elevenpence-half-penny
one—is broken in sight of the audience, and it is
well that Mr. Alderson is a good shot with a sofa
cushion, for the play could positively not proceed
without the allegory, and the allegory couldn’t be
dragged in without the smashed china. The
strong point about the present production is the
staging. Brunton’s scenery in all three sets is
worth locking at, and some of the costumes are
absolutely gorgeous. As for the acting, the
honours arc chiefly appropriated by three per-
formers. Julius Knight’s John Christian is
vigorous and natural ; George P. Carey as David
Ives, the father of the dancing girl, is equally
good, with smaller opportunities, and the Sybil
Crake of Gwendoline Floyd furnishes additional
evidence that this London-journally titled young
lady is likely to do some good for herself. In the
lead, Laura Villiers is, as usual, dainty and
nice, but sorely lacking in power and handicapped
with her inflexible voice and stereotyped arm-
flapping gestures. Clifton Alderson also runs in
nits with bis gesticulation and arouses antagonism
with the male portion of his audiences by looking
unutterably lovely and talking in a finicking, don-
cherkuow. Cockney fashion. Otherwise, the stage
is chiefly given up to inarticulate, unhappy, and
jerky geniuses who wobble on and off simply
because the prompter told them so.
«- * *- *
“ Ours,” the story of an unreasonably
jealous woman, her shortlegged husband, a
wealthy booby, who says mighty smart things, an
ingenious and an ingenuous maiden, a rare done
leg of mutton, and an alleged roley-poley pudding,
with some slight verbal improvements on the
author’s text, tills the bill just about as
fully as on former occasions at Sydney
Criterion. Geo. Titheradge, of course, plays the
brewer—who is always sleeping when he is not
soliloquising—admirably, though all bis old man-
nerisms and Ids old shooting-suit are very much in
evidence. Marie Fraser, as Blanche Hoye,
looked nicer than pie, but lias apparently no sing-
ing voice, and so the little points to be made by
the love-ballad with the tears in the voice, the
falter, and the breakdown, were not scored. Percy
Lyndal repeats a former success, as docs Pattie
Browne, but Nellie Murtyne, who replaces Miss
Romer, looks too youthful and is not sufficiently
dignified as Lady Shendryn. Arthur Lawrence
is perfectly lovely as the old General, but has the
misfortune to succeed Cathcart in apart for which
the latter was physically constructed. Dot Bouci-
cault does not fully fill his partner’s Russia leather
slippers as Prince Perovsky ; he is precise, diminu-
tive, without presence, and suggests an articled-
clerk rather than an absolute autocrat. As Ser-
geant Jones, in George Anson’s absence, MTntyre
gets on better than could have been expected.
Minor parts are not particularly ably filled, but
the scenery of Messrs. Spong and Churchward is
a poem in paint. “Society,” by no means
Robertson’s best, on Saturday next.
*# * *
“Transported for Life ” is well-known to
Sydney audiences as a blood-curdling, marrow-
freezing histrionic hash-np of murder, love,
villainy and heroism, ending as usual in the tardy
triumph of down-trodden virtue over blatantly-
assertive vice. The scene fluctuates between a
life of luxury an I that of a diggings, and the
variety show of the latter spot, with its songs by
Mrs. Darrell and Messrs. Shine and Watson, was
hailed by “the gods” on opening night as a
pleasing innovation. Of course, George Darrell
is the manly and unjustly accused Hubert
Chandos, and equally, of course, Mrs. Darrell is
the lovely and faithful Edith Vaughan, and both
get away with most of the buns in the Garrick
bakery. Arthur Greenaway is all right as the
villain, and other parts are handled by Constance
Deorwyn, Marie Brooks and Miss Clitberoe.
“ East Lynne ” will be played on Friday evening
for Christine Darrell’s benefit.

Nellie Barrens three-weeks-ago injured
ankle continuing to get more inflamed, that little
lady was compelled to absent herself from the
stage of Sydney Royal on Saturday and Monday
last, when the vacant garments were filled by
Grace Blenheim, her under-study, a lady pre-
viously in evidence chiefly as an unimportant
contributor to the tout ensemble. Nellie Farren
takes a benefit on Friday, the 23rd, when “ Cinder
Ellen ” will be played for the last time in Sydney,
and the previously-announced revival of “ Ruy
Bias ” will be carried out on the following even-
ing. Alfred Dampier, after a long absence, opens
in “ Robbery Under Arms ” on Saturday week.

George Leitch, having rested sufficiently,
will rise again next Saturday at Sydney Garrick
and produce “ The Librarian ” —the original of
“The Private Secretary,” and claimed to be more
humorous even than that sad curate with the
goloshes. Also, he is said to be more dank, more
boneless, and more unobtrusive than the other
version, and is driven about harder by Fate and
swept to and fro more helplessly on the tide of
ettcumstanoes. Like the secretary he has a pro-
found longing for buns—“Oh, that it would rain
buns,” he wails in his hunger and grief—and when
his lunch is rent from him he grows terrible in his
feroeitj 7 . These facts can be verified next Satur-
day by anyone who tenders the customary
pecuniary consideration at the door, for the
encouragement of a brilliant and deserving
comedian. Even the sight of George Leitch’s
bright smile is worth the money, and the indi-
vidual who wouldn’t pay to see it is a clod with no
poetry in his soul.

lt is a melancholy fact that the majority
of Melbourne playgoers like best that kind of
tragedy in which a howling lunatic in check pants
plays the lead, his support consisting of two
supers in tin armour representing the Flower of
the Spanish army, and five weird and ancient
chorus-girls consisting chiefly of bones, The
Alexandra, with its present show, deserves
better houses, whenever a work like “ Rigoletto,”
“Lucia,” “Ernani” or “Traviata” is staged,
and, worse luck, it doesn’t get them. Signora
Cuttiea, who makes The Bulletin wish it were
dead when she essays comedy, is as great
a Yioletto Valery as she was a Lucia, or
an Elvira. Her acting in the death-scene was
a finished thing, and when, with the last bubble
of life, she shook off her mourners and striding
down the stage gave the last few bars of the
magnificent music, and, shrieking, fell into Ger-
mont’s arms and died, a great yell arose from the
house, and the curtain came up again in response.
Signorina Tresani and Miss Freeman were satis-
factory as Flora and Amina, and Germont’s
music was well sung by Signor Cuttiea. But be
it understood there isn’t anybody in the show
after the lady who makes up so badly and
sings so well. The mountings are, as
usual, not good enough for a circus; and
when Traviata’s home is shown as a lightning-
blasted humpy witli cheap lace curtains on the
windows, and a half-crown quilt on the bed, and the
bed itself tied up with string, one decides that it
pays just as well to be virtuous and have nice
carpets to walk on, and to sleep on a strictly moral
couch with pink satin hangings. Sara Bern-
hardt playing in a caravan would be con-
sidered an insult. But Cuttiea warbling in
a coffee-stall is evidently thought a perfectly
consistent thing. Monday night he, Cuttiea,
benefited, and “Traviata” and “Ernani” were
repeated during the week. “Faust” and
“ Carmen ” are to go up before the close of the
season, which now draweth very nigh. Mean-
while, “Lucrezia” goeth on the programmes of
this (Thursday) and to-morrow nights,

At the Royal, business is not keeping up
to last week’s standard, and the water in the
tank is not so damp as it was on first night.
Likewise Geo. Rignold has achieved additional
embonpoint and prosiness since last notice, and
the “Lights o’ London ” burn as if they were fed
with condemned kerosene. For all that the
masses recognise the “Lights” as the best
existent drama of the class, and, at any rate, good
paying houses are common. It is about time
though that the mouldy theory that a melo-
dramatic hero can knock 87 policemen and a
naval brigade crooked and endways was exploded.
Mrs. Geo. Rignold plays Mrs. Jarvis pleasantly,
and evidently is seen at her best in old woman
parts.

At the Princess, Maggie Moore still talks
with a cold “id her dose,” and “Our Flat”
collects a few of the scarce shekels in the hands of
the publ’c. Edwin Kelly, once sacred to dashing
quasi-comic military parts, has now settled down
to playing eccentric fathers in frock-coats and a
white curly wig, and our heart aches for those
symmetrically-padded legs through which all the
girls of long ago fell in love with him. Those
girls are now married, and some of them are
divorced, and Edwin plays old eccentric ancestors
with a bad grace.

J.C. W. puts in a short season at the big
house with “Kerry,” and “Rip Van Winkle,”
opening next Saturday. This may be intended
either as a stop-gap or a treasury recouper, but,
under any circumstances, it is bound to be the
latter. J.C.W. is a good all-round actor and a
careful caterer for Australia generally, and is too
much liked to be able to avoid great houses. The
only way he could scare off an audience is by
shooting at it.
* Sf * »
After the trashy comedies of the Princess,
“New Men and Old Acres,” at the Bijou, is cheer-
ing to the soul. The plot of “ New Men ” is essen-
tially simple. Some busted-up aristocrats named
Vavasour are being fired out of the Abbey, their
ancestral hall. There is not enough in the family
strong box to buy a drink with, and so it is
designed to sell pretty Lilian Vavasour to any
person who can table sufficient greed to raise the
mortgage on the crumbling wall and the unhealthy
moat, and free from encumbrance the collection of
tortured bones in the donjon keep. The party
who is expected to provide the coin for all this is
Sam Brown, a wealthy Liverpool merchant,
alleged to have made a big rise in hides or some-
thing smelling equally as bad. For all that, he is a
far better fellow than old Vavasour, who puts on airs
to himself, and privately wails over the comedown
his family has endured. Lilian is slightly in love
with Sam Brown, apart from the monetary con-
siderations, and they become engaged. But a few
days before the intended wedding Brown’s firm
gets into difficulties, or Brown’s partner skips, or
something like that, and a commercial friend in
the shape of a land boomer and company-promoter
fellow named Bunter offers to advance £40,000 on
the Abbey mortgages which he (Brown) holds.
Bunter has discovered the Abbey lands to be full
of rich iron lodes, but when he tries to realise on
his mortgage he finds old Vavasour knows all
about the iron lodes, Brown having acquainted
him therewith. So Brown pulls thro’ and the iron
is sold retail for tuppence a pound or something
like that, and Lilian marries her nearly almost
deadbroke lover, and Bunter dies of the disap-
pointment. Mrs. Brough makes a very fine study
of Lilian Vavasour and all the business, especially
in the scenes with the phlegmatic Sass as Sam
Brown, was as good as anything she has done
before. Bunter, in the hands of G. W. Anson, is
an unctuous person who would recite psalms and
go through a drunken man at the same time,
Corlesse as the financier is very satisfactory. Miss
Romer and Miss Taylor are very good as Lady
Bunter and Mrs. Bunter respectively, and Eille
Norwood as Bertie Fitz Urge is tiresome and a
blot on the bill.

Siiazolle lias bill-sticked Melbourne to the
effect that Cup week shall see him burst out in all
his glory in his illustrated version of “ Enoch
Arden.” These one-man shows, when they are
really good, hardly ever fail to bring grief to
the ambitious entertainment with its tons of prin-
cipals and scenery, and its hundreds of auxiliaries.
And as Snazelle is unapproachable as a one-man
showman, we may expect something very fine.

At the Adelaide Royal “ The Old Guard,”
or rather Billy Elton, has been tickling the
risible faculties of the public to a consider-
able extent, bub “la grippe” has marked several
of the vocalists for its prey, and made them bark
woefully. Also the same disease has decimated
the audience, which shows awful signs of diminu-
tion. Therefore the management revive “The
Gondoliers” “by special request” for a few
nights, for even the dying influenza victim will
crawl out of his bed to see that bright opera once
more, and the takings will lookup. “The Yeo-
man of the Guard ” follows. Taking the season
through, the business has been really good, and
Pete Hughes strokes his bald pate with satisfac-
tion. Fitzgerald’s Circus has opened, and at
Garner’s Rooms, Professor Anderson, “The
Wizard of the North,” (how many of them are
there?) is performing.

What forbearance! Williamson now appears for the first

Christie Murray told a Bulletin London correspondent
that he hopes in a few weeks to have a theatre, and to
start “Ned’s Chum” for a run. He has one or two other
plays in his bag which he commenced in Australia, and
which he will finish forthwith. They are, he says, built
on a broader basis than “ Ned’s Chum,” and will contain
more seriously-purposed work. Christie is in great
request just now, and he has more work than he can well
get through—magazine-fiction for the most part. What
between stage management, acting, writing, and other
w'ork, he says he feels himself a played-out man for the
moment.
Haddon Chambers thinks the play he is now working at

Gounod’s statement that Melba will soon surpass all

son.
Minnie Palmer at latest was about to produce, at the
Vaudeville, London, Mark Ambient’s “ L’Oncle CMestin.”
The Referee, organ of dramatist Sims, says that
Christie Murray, in his play, “Ned’s Chum,” violates
the fundamental dramatic principle of never keeping a
secret from your audience. The play, it remarks, was
not a brilliant failure, for it was not a failure nor was it
brilliant, but it was so mitigated a success that it is un-
likely to be seen again in London. The Sporting Times,
on the other hand, says that the play was an unqualified
success, and will doubtless soon take its place regularly
on the bill at some West End theatre.

Outside a stationer’s shop in Elizabeth-street, Melb., is

On Thursday last, the Minerva Dramatic Society played
“ Love Wins,” a three-act comedy by Savile Clark and de
Tensau, peculiarly adapted to the uses of amateurs, in
the private theatre at “Oakwood,” Glebe Point, Sydney,
the residence of Mrs. Dwyer, before a fashionable audi-
ence, in number over a hundred, the bulk of whom
remained till daylight to take part in the later festivities
of supper and ball. The acting laurels on this occasion
were garnered by Mr. E. J. Redman, the honorary
stage-manager and scene-painter, who, in the lead, ac-
quitted himself creditably, while the wreaths that remained
were annexed by Miss Tompson, as “ old woman,” Miss
Meotti(who comes of an acting family), as the good fairy,
and Mr. J. O. M. Skelton, president of the club, as the

Wilson Barrett, before adopting the sock and buskin,
was a mercantile clerk in London. Arthur Roberts was a
lawyer’s clerk there, and Frank Thornton used to beguile
the tedium of his occupation as a soft-goods clerk by
occasional appearances in small parts, until he finally
blossomed into a professional actor. Harry Hunter, one
of the Mohawk minstrels, was a tea-taster in Mincing-
lane ; Jerome K. Jerome, a goods-clerk at the Broad-
street station ; Henry Pettit, ditto on the Midland Rail-
way office in Whitecross-street; whilst G. R. Sims was a
clerk in his father’s counting-house in Aldersgate-street.

here, and gave the coveted mounts to a lot of raw

eyes, and plump, well-rounded forms. Had the

cade this would have been the correct thine

“Bryan O’Lynn” Phillips, the owner of
the famous Panic, left £36,000 behind him.
Panic was buried on the old man’s Purnim

duced gold-lace into the N.S.W. Cadet-force.
Gold-lace means snobbery, and will involve
“cadet ” being generally accepted as the diminu-
tive of cad.
It is a singular coincidence that while
Parkes formed his resolution to ride for a fall at
the bedside of his dying sister, Dibbs, at the
bedside of his dying mother, undertook to form
a Cabinet.
Much consternation has been caused in
Melbourne by the resignation of a prominent
Hebrew of his Jewish ecclesiastical position and a
simultaneous appearance of his name in the
committee list of a Christian church.
John Haynes boasts that it was he who
really pulled the strings that strangled Parkes.
“Hi neither want your hacquaintanee nor your
support,” said Parkes, scornfully, to Haynes
during the debate on the Naval Tribute Bill.
Lawyer Sheridan, of Adelaide, lecturing
before the local A.N.A. :—“With a view to

He bathes in the Spree up to his ears, the consequence

No Sydney paper even ever thus venomously in-

Had the branches of the legal profession
been amalgamated, W. J. Trickett would have
been eligible for the N.S. W. Attorney-Generalship
in the Dibbs Ministry. An attorney is legally
eligible ; but the etiquette of the “ horsehair ”
brigade overrides the law of the land. Talk about
“ boycotting and intimidation !”
Arthur Francis Wood, who, as Govern-
ment surveyor, originally laid out Rockhampton
(Q.), in ’5B, and who had ever since identified
himself with the varying fortunes of the city, died
on 14th October, aged 64 years. He was at one
time a wealthy local property-owner, but he was
the sort of man who pinned wings on to his riches.
General Booth proposes to secure a certain
huge abandoned London market (erected by
Baroness Coutts) for the sale of Australian frozen
meat. The latter is now landed in London at two
pence per pound, and the London butchers retail
it at nearly, if not quite English prices, and often
as English beef. Booth proposes to undersell
these butchers and if possible get a monopoly of
the meat-trade !
For the first time for nearly 30 years.
Mount William, from the summit of which
Mitchell made some of his most important ob-
servations, was covered with snow last week. It
was by tracing O’Mealley’s tracks after a fall of
snow on Mount William, that that notorious
bushranger was captured, after he had defied the
police—and police were fine bushmen in those
days—for several months,
B. D. Morehead apparently touts for the
R.O. vote by saying that “ Romanists have been
shamefully treated under the Queensland Educa-
tion Act.” He adds a little side-spout for the
Protestant church-vote by urging that the Bible
be read in schools. “This secular system of
education,” says he, “ will yet bring a great
disaster upon the colony.” When twitted with an
old-time fiery speech of his against State-school
Bible reading, Morehead calmly explained that
he had then referred to the Old Testament only,
adding that an expurgated edition of the Bible is
sadly needed. “Let the Old Testament go, let
it be burnt, but the New Testament, or portions
of it, should be taught.” And Morehead should
be commissioned to expound it, eh ?
Parkes’s last snort :
I think it has been abundantly proved so far that the
present is a worse House for the conduct of business than
any which has preceded it. In other words, I don’t think
that there was ever so much difficulty in the way of the
transaction of business as there is now, One certain
result will be that it will lead to the strengthening of the
Legislative Council. The Upper House will exercise more
influence and will possess a larger measure of power than
it has ever had during its existence. Another result
will he to rouse the inert power which exists in the com-
munity. Take the city of Sydney. There are owners of
the whole of it, and if the owners unite they will possess
more power than those who don’t own anything in it.
Hitherto they have been singularly indolent and neglect-
ful of their interests. What may happen may be a
thorough rousing of this inert power in the community,
a power which has never yet once exercised itself. It
takes a great deal to rouse it, but once roused it will dis-
play a front which has not been seen yet.
This is first, a shriek and a curse at the Labour-
party and an intimation that Property is going to
unite as one money-bag and. wipe it out; and
second, a howl at Property because it hasn’t
united and done the job already. And from
these remarks we can guess how Parkes wants to
spend his old age. He wants to retire to his villa,
with £lO,OOO voted to him by a grateful country,
and from the front window he intends to look out
at the great uprising of the landlords; and then,
in between times, he will write “ poetry ” and
furnish bulletins about the state of his lame leg,
and he will keep a big dog in the yard to scare off
creditors. And now and then, in the twilight, he
will take the infant down to the front gate, and
rest it on top of the gate-post, and there teach the
young idea how to shoot, and lead a simple, pas-
toral existence generally.

Christie Murray has become insolvent.
Wo mean formally insolvent,

bourne’s Mayor, is a wine and spirit merchant.
Captain O'Shea’s daughters sent wreaths
for the coffin of Parnell, their mother’s new
husband.
Jemmy Mirams, having expressed a re-
solve to enter Parliament, is “ Mistered ” again by
the papers.
The sister-in-law of a Victorian Supreme
Court Judge gains a scanty livelihood by fortune-
telling in Carlton.
The Jubilee Juggins is now a canvasser for
an insurance company. A new rival to Mortimer
Franklyn. This is probably a lie.
The late Pope Hennessy was in receipt of
£60 per annum—he had no other means—when he
was first elected to the House of Commons.
Dr. Madden, Q.C., the eminent Mel-
bourne barrister, has built a spring cart with his
very own hands. He has designs out for a Black
Maria.
An obituary advertisement appears in a
Sydney paper to show that the lately-deceased
Bookstall Smith, of England, was first cousin to
two local residents.
“ Pat ’ Auld, one of the leading members
°f M‘Douall Stuart’s first exploration party, is
still alive and well and conducts a wine and spirit
business in Adelaide.
It is alleged that a certain well-known
Sydney Hebrew lawyer has turned his back upon
the ancient faith, and now regularly attends St.
Mark’s, Darling Point.
Murphy, ex-proprietor of the first brewery
established in Melbourne, died the other day.
He leaves, it is said, little short of a million in
Victorian and N.S.W. property.
One of the “ biggest bugs ” in London (in
his own little way) is Edmund Rouse, formerly of
the City Bank, Sydney, and now manager of the
London Branch of the City of Melbourne Bank.
The grand object of Right Hon. W. H.
Smith s life was to absorb the splendid Powder-
ham estate, of a spendthrift lordling, and the
deglutition was beautifully in progress, when—
alas !
Jimmy Tyson is said to be arranging with
the Q. Government to purchase several millions
of acres of country, under the Special Sales of
Crown Lands Bill, that will shortly come into
operation.
When big John O’Shanassy visited
England he saw Edward Wilson, formerly of the
Argus, and O Shanassy wrote a Melbourne friend
that Wilson told him the English Monarchy was
hurrying to its fall. ,
Parnell was described by a lady, shortly
after his marriage, as “gracious and fascinating in
manner, gentle in speech, and considerate to the
humblest domestic; ’ and his wife as “a hand-
some brunette, of about 35. ”
Christie Murray opened his Australian
impressions in Sydney D.T. with—“ What any
individual coming from the other side of the world
may think about Australia is not greatly impor-
tant to that giant continent.”
Lord Carington, it is generally remarked
in London, improved wonderfully as a platform
speaker through his practice in N.S. Wales. He
is really popular in High Wycombe, which proves
that he cannot be a bad landlord.
An epidemic rages amongst the N.S.W 7- .
Knights as we write. Sir Alfred Stephen,
Sir John Hay, Sir William Manning, and Sir
William Macleay—all aged men—are reported ill,
the latter in an extremely critical state.
“ Barnum ” Booth never had such a good
thing on financially as when his wife died. Under
the circumstances, he might advantageously
become a Mormon. The more wives, the more
deaths, the more deaths, the more boodle.
Dr. Le Fevre, M.L.C., of Melbourne,
Vic., whose death in England is reported by cable,
became, some 13 years ago, medical officer to the
Age employees, and, like all Age attachments,
soon found himself pitchforked into politics.
Alexander Bowman, member for the
Hawkesbury in the N.S.W. Legislature, and
John Marks, one of the members for Paddington,
can be backed for money to sleep against any two
senators anywhere. Bowman slept through half-
a dozen divisions on one evening.
Henry Halloran and George Thornton are
about the only two left of the residents of Sydney
who subscribed to Sir Henry Parkes’ “Stolen
Moments, published in 1842. A few subscribers
to the “poems ” were acknowledged as “esquires,”
but the bulk of them were “misters.” ’
Mention of Parson Fitchett in a cablegram
reminds one that the Melbourne D.T. comps,
defended themselves against that brainy saint’s
awful hieroglyphics by demanding extra pay for
setting up his “copy.” which was as bad as that
of Kingston, Q.C., of Adelaide, or Francis Myers.
Admiral Lord Charles Scott has intimated
to the Southern press that he desires to be printed
d°wn as “His Excellency the Admiral,” or as
‘ His Excellency Lord Charles Scott!” The
Bulletin adores brevity. His Nibs’ title is there-
fore “Ad. Scott,” and lie is going to lie kept at
that.
Mr. J. Turner M‘Donald of Launceston
(Tas.) who has done a lot of sound journalistic
work in the intervals of managing a large business
concern of a peculiarly trying nature, is engaged
m the preparation of a Life of Sir Richard Dry-
one of the famous “Patriotic Six,” and afterwards
Premier of Tasmania.
Sydney Jephcott, the long-haired, sun-
tanned bush bard, is running a volume of short
poems through the London press under the care of
Ijrancis W. Adams. The book named “The
Secrets of the South,” is dedicated in one of its
lengthiest poems to Olive Schreiner, “the first-
born daughter of the South.”
Rev. Rigg, Wesleyan minister (Vie.) and
President of the Australasian Conference, died
the other day. Ho was one of the few authors of
the Connection, ’ but not a patch, as a literary
man, on his really famous brother—perhaps the
most notable intellect that the Wesleyan Metho-
dists have produced in 50 years.
Rew M‘Dowall, of Cooktown, N.Q., the
other Sunday, delegated the task of conducting
services in the local kirk to Capt. W. E. Armit,
of Neyv-Guinea-exploration, journalistic, and other
varieties of fame. Armit rose to the occasion,
and chose his text from Shakespeare. The unco’
guid incontinently struck for home.
The personal or family name of the Earl
of Portsmouth is Isaac Wallop. Wallop is
rather a good name for an earl. Yet none of the
earls you meet in the modern society novel are
named Wallop. A few peers named Isaac Wallop
judiciously scattered through the pages of fiction
would do a lot to undermine the British aris-
tocracy. Just think of it! Wallop !
Three N. S. Wales
Legislative Councillors
were discussing Han-
sard. “Well, notwith-
standing the now general
use of phonography, the
reports of to-day are not
equal to the old Legisla-
tive Council reports,”
said one. There was a
momentary silence, then;
“I don’t see what tellin’
the bumps ’as to do
with ’Ansard ! ” quoth
another.
A DEBUTANTE.
FIRST DITTO : “Is that her ? ”
SECOND DITTO: “Yes; ain’t she fine?”
FIRST DITTO : “Well, I don’t think much of her voice.”
It is cabled that Prince George of Wales
comes to Sydney as Commander with Admiral
Stephenson, Admiral Scott’s successor. By the
way, how unlike Prince George is to the rest of
the Prince of Wales’ family, and how strikingly
he resembles Lord Charles" Beresford ! Placing
their photographs side by side, you might take
them for younger and elder brother.
Kate Reilly, the celebrated coutouriere of
Dover-street, Piccadilly, is married to Major
Griffiths, who, by-the-by, is a cousin of Fred.
Griffiths, of Sydney. The Major is an Inspector
of Prisons, for which he receives £l2OO a year. He
makes at least another thousand by literature, and
as the profits of the dressmaking business are
large, they should have a splendid income between
them.
A back-blocks (N.S.W.) township had an
unorthodox Mayor, who christened his first-born
“Oliver Cromwell.” This jarred the nerves of
the Irish nurse, who said, “ Don’t you know, sor,
that Oliver Cromwell was a very bad man ?—he
cut all the throats of the priests in Ireland !”
“And I hope,” said the happy father, “that if
my son grows up to be a man he’ll cut the throats
of all the bishops.”
The Divine Sara is still spoken of lovingly
by the boots at the Australia Hotel, Sydney. At
11.30 each night she sat down to a sumptuous
dinner; at two she retired ; and at five she re-
hearsed—to the great delight of the boots and
other early risers. The corridor was thronged as
the rehearsal proceeded. Sara never used th e
main entrance when she was leaving for the
theatre in the evening; she invariably went out
by the gate leading into Moore-street from the
basement.
H. B. Marriott Watson’s now novel, “The
Web of the Spider,” is a tale of the Maori war.
Watson is one of the slowly-increasing colony of
Australian litterateurs in London, and, in many
respects, the ablest. He has seen things. Most
of the other men have only heard and read about
’em. Watson owes nothing of his accumulating
celebrity to the cheap—and nasty—“country-
supplement ” publishing firm in Melbourne who
allowed his first remarkable novel to appear in
their collections of hash.
The present Duke of Athole is a combina-
tion of one duke, a marquis, about nine earls, and
fifteen assorted viscounts, barons, and other sun-
dries. It is painful to think that if anybody runs
a tramcar over him there will be 2G peers all lying
dead together in a gory heap in the roadway.
This sort of thing should make an ordinary citizen
feel thankful. If a plain individual named Thom-
son is rushed over by a dray he can’t make more
than one mangled corpse anyhow, which is a great
deal nicer than being 26 dead bodies all at once.
The William Bridger whom we see adver-
tised for in the Maoriland papers, is said to have
come to Australia in the year 1872. Now in that
year, Messrs. Nichols and Lester, hanged at
Darlinghurst for the murder of a man named
Walker, confessed to having murdered another
man named Bridger, whose body was found in the
Parramatta River, at Hen and Chickens Bay.
Bridger had been a steward on board H.M.S.
Rosario, and was decoyed up the river by his
murderers on pretence of finding him a situation.
It was back in the sixties, at a Criminal
Court in the Hunter (N.S.W.) district. It was
always hard for the Crown to get a convicting
jury in a cattle-stealing case, but the evidence
against the prisoner this time was overwhelming
and the Chief Justice (Sir Alfred Stephen) was
determined to have him “ shopped,” summing-up
accordingly. The jury retired for ten minutes
and came back with a unanimous “not guilty.’’
His Honor, after noting the verdict with a
thoughtful air; “Prisoner, you are discharged ; ”
then with a suave smile, “and the jury, too.” ’
The late Mr. Sheridan Moore, who died
in Sydney rather suddenly last week of paralysis,
after an eventful life, was a fine classical scholar
and a man of highly-cultivated literary tastes. He
was_ the tutor of many men who afterwards
attained professional distinction—and he was the
real author of many a flowing oratorical period
palmed off by more than one political humbug as
his (the humbug’s) very own. It was to Moore’s
influence that one or two unlettered people who
have acquired a certain kind of reputation as
public speakers owe their fondness for the ancient
Crakes and Romans. “Whin Dimosthenes
stood by the say-shore ” —how often have we
laughed at it!
When Clement Wragge, the Queensland
meteorologist, was “ at home,” he spent his vaca-
tions in ascending Scottish and Welsh mountains
to collect weather-data. On one occasion, he had
ascended Ben Nevis late one day, for the purpose
of taking daybreak observations next morning.
His friends were surprised at his return the same
evening, and on asking him the reason, he re-
sponded, after a very patent attempt to collect
Ins thoughts, that when he reached the top of the
mountain he had forgotten for what purpose ho
had made the trip. Clement must be the real
original man who absent-mindedly forgot his wife
when he started on his honeymoon tour.
G. R, Dibbs, if not born at the old Plao-
staff Hill, Sydney, at least spent his early days
there. He went to a school kept by A. G.
iaylor s father, or, if he didn’t, he ought to have
done so, as the school was next door to his
mother s house. As a lad (writes a correspondent
who professes to have known George in those days)
he was the leader of a party of boys who used to
make shell grottoes and provide themselves with
‘lollies ” in that way. On great occasions George
playing a fife, used to head his'band and visit all
the houses on the hill in quest of—-well, let us
call it hush-money. When he grew beyond this
kind of thing he was put into a merchant’s office
and afterwards drifted away to Chili, where he
made and lost money.
Mayor M‘Mahon, of Fitzroy (Vic,), who
threatens to c. ntest Best’s seat at next election, is
a tailor who rose to sudden affluence in the land-
boom. But in his earlier days he was a very hard-
driven tailor, and made ends meet with difficulty.
Once Watts, of the Argus (the fellow who started
a first Argos leader with “ If there be a God ”)
gave him an order for a pair of pants. “Very
good, Mr. Watts,” said Mac.; “ those trousers will
be ready be Chusday.” So on “ Chusday ” Watts
called and found M‘Mahon and his only employe,
a tailoress, at work on another job. “ Mr. Watts,”
said the present Mayor, deprecatingly, “I’ve
brukken me word. I have a terrible lot of work
to-day, but I’ll have the pants finished be
ffedmday, Jane (to the girl) put two men on
to Mr. Watts’ trousers at ivonst.” He had to brag
or die, and he bragged.
When Admiral Sir Chas. Hotham assumed
the Victorian Governorship he began to harry the
local civil service. Strolling into Melbourne" Cus-
tom-house one morning, he found the old house-
keeper dusting the place ; no one else had arrived.
The Governor waited until a “swagger’ clerk
appeared, leisurely hung up his hat, and spread
himself out to read the Argus. Hotham
sharply tapped the desk with his cane, whereupon
the languid swell enquired : “Ah—what is —ah—
themattah?” “ Where’s the chief clerk?” “He
—be heah till about half-past ten,”
drawlmgly replied the young potentate, again
hiding his head in the newspaper. “Well, when
he does come tell him that a person known as Sir
Charles Hotham called, and will call again to*
morrow morning at nine o'clock sharp.” And at
nine sharp next morning everyone was on duty,
from the Collector downwards. But presently
the diggers took up the old man’s spare time, and
the civil servants got a rest.
Ihe last nine months’ gold-export from
Rockhampton shows a decrease of nearly 50,000oz.
Hey for Mount Morgan !
Judge Windeyer is just now weeping over
the fact that there is no place in N.S. W. where
youthful offenders can be sent for reformation.
Yes, there is, Judge—the scaffold at Darlinghurst
gaol. Some 17 or 18-year-olds were reformed there
one fine warm morning not so long ago.
‘‘ ’ Tis never too late to mend ” is an old
saying, very applicable in cases of reformation or
leaving off bad habits, but in cases of sickness or
disease no delay must occur, or it very probably
will soon be “ too late to mend.” At the on-
set of disease almost every case is curable • if
neglected almost every disease will progress
beyond its curable stages. A simple headache is
a reflex sign that some internal organ is
deranged, and this irregularity continues and
increases, although the noticeable signs—head-
ache, &c. ; disappear. An early treatment with
Clements Tonic is necessary, and must, on
account of its scientific composition, prove an
effective remedy. Mrs. Moeller, Georgina-street,
Newtown, N.S.W., writes: “I can with con-
fidence bear witness to the wonderful efficacy of
Clements Tonic in curing liver and kidnev disease.
I have long been a victim to indigestion (caused
by liver complaint) and an affection of the
kidneys. I suffered terribly from headaches,
pains in the back and side, with obstinate
constipation. No one except myself knows what
my sufferings have been. 1 was always tired and
languid, with no ability or inclination to perform
my daily work. My tongue was furred in a
morning, and a sour taste in the mouth, and
frequent vomiting. One day I w r ould be pretty well
and the next very distressed or completely pros-
trated with a very confirmed languor. This
went on until I w 7 as so ill I was completely done
up.and quite unable to move. My ankles being
swollen as thick as my thighs, I consulted
physicians, all of whom pronounced the case one
of dropsy. They variously ascribed the cause to
be heart, liver or Bright’s disease. The kidneys
were undoubtedly diseased, because the swollen
ankles when pressed with the finger would leave a
dent in the place for days, and it was easy to press
the end of the finger an inch deep, when the hole
would not fill up for four days. I had heard of
the wonderful cures effected bv Clements Tonic
and commenced its use. I took three bottles and
the swelling in the ankles commenced gradually to
subside. I continued the medicine, and am now
completely cured ; my ankles are their usual size ;
I have no aches nor pains and can do a good day’s
work with pleasure; my tired aching feelings have
all disappeared, and I am confident I have been
rescued from an untimely grave by the wonderful
virtues of Clements Tonic. My address is at the
head of this letter, and I will reply to any
communications if a stamped envelope is sent with
enquiry, as I consider it my duty to publish a
record of my wonderful cure.” Remember there
are hundreds of imitations in Australasia; insist
on Clements Tonic. ’Tis sold by all chemists and
storekeepers ; to take substitutes is onlv to waste
your time and money.

letin’s consists in Rosa showing Parkes how to
make I O IPs serve as sovereigns.
The “National” Associations can’t even
hang tin bait on so as to hide the hook, and
spread the net in the sight of the bird.
Parkes says that he will be as great a man
outside the House as in it. When he was out of
office last time the dogs barked at him.
Cynically-interpreted title of Premier
Griffith’s latest District Courts Bill “ A Bill to
incidentally provide a pension for Judge Paul.”
That brilliant parson, Fitchett, Melbourne
D.T. editor, has been lecturing the New York
Methodist Conference on the villainy of the
Victorian Education Act.
Premier Parkes would like to retire.
Members of N.S.W. Legislative Assembly are
being approached as to their willingness to vote
him £lO,OOO in that event.
N.S.W. Assembly talks much more than
Victorian Assembly—according to the Hansaeds.
No credit is allowed to the Victorian Hansaed
for its judicious condensation of prosy speakers.
According to a Melbourne paper, Derham,
M.L.A., describes Labour-candidates in general
as “agitators and carrion.” The other party
consists, we presume, of stagnation and old fat.
Treasurer MTlwraith “ There is an old
saying: ‘ Fiat justitia mat caelum ,’ which I may
translate— ‘ Tell the truth, speak out what you
think, even though the Bank of England
blusters.’”
The personnel of Booth’s Queensland
patrons—like the personnel of his N.S.W. sup-
porters—is the most convincing condemnation of
his little game that the least suspicious Australian
could require.
Henyy George says that the Single-tax
party hold the balance of power in the N.S.W.
Legislature. Wrong again ; there are not more
than half-a-dozen declared Single-taxers in the
Labour-party.
It has been suggested that the Australian
Parliament ought to restrict the emigration to
Australia of the British titled aristocracy—allow-
ing a ship to carry only one for every thousand
tons of her register.
Graham Berry will, on leaving the Agent-
Generalship, return to Victoria. Ah ! If he were
young once more and knew what he knows now,
and could start orating again from that cart in
the Eastern market!
“I have seen the election of everybody to
the Parliament of this country. I have seen them
come up the hill, and I have seen them go down
again. I have seen them disappear never to be
heard of again.”— Paekes.
According to Parkes, when the political
shoe pinches, the advocate of eight hours as a
statutory day’s labour for a collier is “in his
heart and soul in all essential respects as great a
tyrant as the Emperor Nero.”
“The strike of the workmen at the Im-
perial Institute building, London, against the
employment of non-union labour, has collapsed.”
The Imperial Institute, subsidised by Australia,
is therefore to be erected by blackleg labour.
Any member of Parliament who lacks the
intelligence to grip the outlines of Booth’s scheme,
which, in form and essence, is a barefaced attempt
to exploit the Australian labour-market for the
benefit of the English classes, should make way
for somebody with brains.
One result of the political scandals in
Canada is that a public agitation against the
Governor-General as a mere puppet of Ministers
has been stirred up, and the outcome may be the
establishment of a system of electing future
Governors by popular ballot.
Booth says that although offered a million
acres of good land in a beautiful South American
climate with all sorts of Customs and railway con-
cessions, he prefers to make his first experiment
under the British flag. Well, the day approaches
when the British flag will be courteously treated
as a foreign flag in Australia.
Commonwealth Bill strangled by its alleged
author —to avoid a crushing defeat by the demo-
cratic party in the N.S.W. Assembly on the 3rd
November ! What think “we ” now at the Court
of St. James of withholding the hearldom from the
old Chartist? Parkes has had his revenge on the
people as well as on the Court.
What has long been threatened in N.S.W.
Eolitics may come about —a coalition. The S.M.
[erald persistently advocates it, the capitalists
on both sides of the House hunger after it as a
means of “dishing” the Labour-party, and Dibbs
has of late been strolling of an evening into the
Ministerial room as if he kept a despatch-box
there.
It is said that Sir Henry Parkes positively
refused to appoint Mr. J. Johnson, Member for
Balmain, to the N.S.W. Legislative Council. Mr.
Johnson expressed his wish to several members of
the Parkes Cabinet; but each and all of them
would not hear of a “labour-representative’’being
summoned to the nominee Council to do battle for
the masses against the classes.
Ninian Melville, Chairman of the N.S.W.
Assembly, is very hard to please in chairs. He
has had three chairs made expressly for his com-
fort in about 18 months. He won’t be _ pleased
until he is ensconced in the Speaker’s chair. Mr.
Melville’s chair is not placed on the floor, like any
other chairman’s chair, but on a sort of rotatory
box, which raises him about a foot above the
clerks by his side.
“ Any man who would accept a seat in the
Legislative Council (N.S.W.) on the sole nomina-
tion of Sir Henry Parkes must have a poor sense
of honour. There are men in the Council who
were never intended by God or man to be there,
and I have not the slightest doubt they were
appointed by Sir Henry Parkes. I should be
ready for one to wipe out of political existence
such soulless beings.”— Dan. O'Connor. Mr.
A RARA AVIS.
DYING MAN: “All I can say is that I die an honest man. lam only fretting about
my wife who is penniless.”
F RIEND: “Oh, I’ll see to that—l’ll talk to the Waxworks man. lam sure he’ll buy your
body to have it stuffed; honest men are as rare as bushrangers now in
Australia.”
Dan. O’Connor now sits in the despised Council
as a nominee of the same Sir Henry Parkes.
The Parkes’ Ministry rode hard for a fall.
Minister Young openly denounced the party in
the country, and the Premier and the Treasurer
patronised “ General ” Booth. The eight-hour
provision in the Coal Mines Bill was Parkes’ great
card, and in a vigorous speech—the most eloquent
he has delivered for months —he goaded the labor
men into direct opposition, and then and there
threw up the sponge, on the altar of “individual
liberty.”
The D.N. Argus says that such an Associa-
tion as the Licensed Victuallers will also be a dis-
tinctively “Temperance” Society, if it acts up
faithfully and consistently to the tenets it has
promulgated. Very likely. Old Beelzebub would
be a Paraclete if he acted up to all the Scripture
he can quote. It is surely the uttermost peak of
bunkum to pretend to credit with a holy desire
for temperance people who live by all-round grog-
swilling.
The Bulletin has received' the following
telegram from a N.S.W. country town. The
name of the sender isn’t Smith, but that will do
as well as any other
First meeting labour league last night. A. Smith
delivered a masterpiece of oratory. (Signed) A. Smith.
Yerily, if there ever was a flower that was born to
blush unseen, the name of that flower was A.
Smith. And he actually sent us a “ collect ”
telegram.
A little light is thrown upon the Federa-
tion under the Crown Convention by Hazell’s
Annual. It represents Sir Henry Parkes as one
of the most remarkable men who have risen to
political eminence through journalism. It says,
erroneously, “he visited England in 1887 as the
representative of N.S.W. at the Colonial Confer-
ence which has been described by Lord Rosebery
as the ‘inauguration of Imperial Federation;’”
and “on that subject Sir Henry issued an im-
portant manifesto in October, 1889.
Parkes’ eccentric conduct recalls the
“character” which Dan. O’Connor, his Post-
master-General, gave him not long ago in the
NS W. Assembly :—“ Sir Henry Parkes is a
dangerous leader. He is not fit to be trusted with
power for he is always a tyrant and always a
coward. No man has exhibited a greater desire
to become a dictator than Sir Henry 1 aikes. No
man would more willingly ride roughshod over
our liberties than he. He has sprung from the
ranks of the people, but he is a veritable tyrant.
Said Tim Healy on 20th November last,
three days after the verdict in the Divorce
Court :
We must remember that for Ireland and for Irishmen
Mr. Parnell is less a man than an institution. We have,
under the shadow of his name, secured for Ireland a
power and an authority in the councils of Great Britain
and the world such as we never possessed before. Ana
when I see a demand made tor retirement and resigna-
tion, I ask you to remember the futility thereof. I say it
would be criminal—aye, it would be absurd and foolish
in the highest degree—were we to surrender the great
chief who has led us so far forward.
Parkes played his last cards badly, after
all. He should have retired after the general
election, let the Labour-party squeeze Dibbs, and
come back, if he could, later on, to calmly assert
that he was the only true democrat.
By a majority division of 35 to 15, Premier
Griffith has succeeded in getting his three-legged
Provincial proposals agreed to by Bananaland
Legislative Assembly, the chiefest obstacle thereto
being sponged out by the Northern and Central
members (with two or three exceptions) agreeing
to \\ aive the right of the Provincial Governments
to build up each its own tariff, the argument being
that the newly-provinced colony should be pre-
pared at any time to dovetail with the future
Australian Federation on a basis of intercolonial
Freetrade, with a common foreign tariff. The
next step in the complicated process is to re-
submit the whole scheme in the form of a_ Bill, to
be afterwards approved by the British legislature.
Thus, every stage towards the free self-govern-
ment of Australia is clogged by hampering side-
hobbles to a distant and foreign Crown.
The Tory St. James’ Gazette reluc-
tantly admits that the failure of the Indian
Government prosecution of the vernacular
journal Bangabasi “is a terrible blow at the
Imperial prestige, although the justice of the
decision cannot be questioned.” In other words,
the Gazette is quite prepared to uphold the im-
perial domination at all hazards, irrespective ot
the moral basis of individual acts of administra-
tive authority. Which is preferable—the cool,
smug hypocrisy of the Tory journalist’s position,
or the icy cynicism of the German and French
press, which declare “ We’re going to colonise, and
we’re going to rule the native races who run
against our colonists, and if, in the impact, the
natives go under, well, that’s their look-out ?
Both are brutal, but the latter is at least straight.
Cable item under the heading of “ The
British Race ” :
Mr. J. A. Froude, the historian, says that a federalist
parliament would be an absurdity, while commercial
union is impossible. The bond between Great Britain
and the colonies at present subsisting is not galling, and
it is better not to speak of separation. He supports the
suggestion that there should be periodic contests between
the branches of the British race in industry, athletics,
and culture.
Then the empire is to be held together by high
jumps and consolidated by gymnastics. By-and-
bye it will be linked together by prize fights, and
the “silken bonds” will consist chiefly of damaged
noses and swollen ears. And after that it will
get down, we presume, to rat-hunts, and the State
will be kept from falling asunder by international
rooster-skirmishes. And then it can’t get down
much further, unless it gets down to stamping on
worms.
Dear Bulletin, —Apropos of Parkes’
assertion that the appellation “Riverina” is
excluded from all N.S. Wales Government docu-
ments, the statement has just that proportion of
accuracy which characterises the most of the old
man’s bombastic deliveries from his high horse —
that is to say, it is untrue. I am not going to
waste time by turning up the record, but give
from memory three papers. (1) Cowper’s cor-
x'espondence witli Sir John Young, and that
Governor’s with Downing-street, over the petition
for the severance of Riverina ; (2) Cowper’s
correspondence with the petitioners; and (3)
Morris and Ranken s Land Report. Specific
research would, I am sure, bring out a couple of
’ dozen more instances. The old man should have
consulted on the point his friend and creditor,
Sir Pat. In addition to numerous other reasons
why N.S. Wales people should deplore cna
Riverina was not formed into a separate province
is the certainty that had severance been effected,
Sir Pat. would never have been a N.S. Wale?
legislator.— A Hireling Scribe.
Henniker Heaton states that when he first
went to Berlin he only succeeded in finding in the
great library one book about Australia, and that
was Mudie’s “Felonry of N.S. Wales.” He says
that they have now plenty of Australian boobs,
and sell German-made boomerangs in the streets
at a shilling apiece with full directions in German
and English how to use them.
A deputation of miserable unemployed
men, who waited on the Mayor of Brisbane the
other day. told various tales of desperate willing-
ness to work. One offered to take stone-breaking
at 2s. a day. It was said that numbers of men
could be produced who would be glad to take pick-
and-shovel work at 2s. fid. a day. Atop of all this
destitution the Griffith-M‘llwraith-Tozer trinity
is importing cheap Italian hash, and has lent a
gracious ear to “ General ” Booth's scheme for
importing more cheap and refuse labour.
The winner of the Queen’s Prize at Bisley,
Eng., this year, was David Dear, of whom the
story is told that, being once a guest at a fashion-
able At Home, the servant enquired his name.
“ David Dear,” said he. Penelope Ann blushed
vividly, and aske.d—“ But, please, what is your
other name?” “ I have no other name but David
Dear.” She announced him as “Mr. David.” A
similar occurrence happened to J. Dear, telegraph
station-master at Gin Gin, Q., but long before he
saw that sequestered repeating-office. He gave
“J. W. Dear” as his name, and he was ushered
in by a loud-voiced menial as “ Misthur Jaydub
Belle w.”
The other day a Perth (W.A.) stockbroker
called round at the office of Liberty, and with
premeditated ferocity and malice aforethought he
spanked the arcfiiraedean lever with a large piece
of leather. The injured editor nearly fills the
next issue of the paper with an account of his
feelings and damages. After explaining how the
sharebroker wrote asking him to visit his office,
and how there was 2d. deficient postage on the
letter, he proceeds thus :
We fully intended visiting this Glover in his lair but
the responsibilities of a gigantic undertaking and the
superintendence of a successful newspaper prohibited us
from immediately interviewing this shining light of the
Perth Stock Exchange. On Tuesday afternoon we were
not sitting in our sacred sanctum, surrounded with our
contemporaries, and accompanied by the proverbial
paste pot and scissors, but we were engaged in the
undignified occupation of type-snatching. We were at
peace with the world having had a good week and [a
sufficiency of coin wherewith to purchase the neces-
saries of life and to pay wages. “Click, click, click,”
went the type, as we gradually emptied “stick” after
“stick’’when suddenly our vision was obscured by the
appearance of Glover, who asked for Mr. Anderson. He
was answered in a friendly way and invited in. We
proceeded with our type-snatching when, without the
slightest warning, we were seized by the throat,
virtually garotted, and pinioned to the frame at which we
had been performing honest toil. A long slashing whip
flickered in the air and descended on us with no light
hand. Swish came the whip as the terrible grasp on our
throat tightened and this cowardly miscreant continued
to take advantage of our helpless position. At last just
about the time when we had thought of “ giving up the
ghost” assistance came in the shape of one of our faith-
ful retainers, who seized the infuriated share-broker by
the waist and literally dragged him off his victim. The
exertions of the struggle had evidently proved too much
for our would-be-slayer, his courage evaporated into his
boots, and he lay panting and trembling in our faithful
henchman’s arms, truly a pitiable sight, while we
regained consciousness. Our enemy lay at our mercy,
but his white, wan face, his pathetic gestures touched
our better side, we forgot that he crept on us like unto a
snake, that he as it were, stabbed us in the dark, while
we welcomed him unto our abode. Perhaps we had not
recovered from the strangulation. Anyhow, surrounded
by our principal devils, who had rushed from various
parts of the building and at a sign from the Chief D, our
assailant beat a retreat, evidently glad to get away
so easily from the crowd of jackals, who, armed with
Mannlicher rifles and smokeless powder, at a sign from
their master would have devoured him and his funeral
would have been to-morrow.
MUM.
“ Mum’s ” the word in Russian journals,
Though a million breadless poor
Lie, with “ rats ” in their internals,
Dying at the hovel door;
In the par. or special column
Never shall a groan be heard,
Breaking through the silence solemn —
“ Mum’s ” the word !
Could the monarch and his nobles
If perusing, quite distress’!,
Gruesome yarns of famine troubles,
Eat their plover-eggs with zest ?
Can they save the starving ryot ?
No, the very thought’s absurd !
Better keep the matter quiet,
“Mum’s ” the word.
Let the writers air opinions
On the theme of Russia’s might :
Let ’em howl for more dominions,
Let the trained assassins skite.
Bury deep the rotting masses
Whilst the captains, silver-spurred,
Drink to “ war ! ” in sparkling glasses
(Mumm’s the word).
“ Mum’s ” the word when things unpleasant
Certain critics dare discuss,
Subjects like the Russian peasant
Oft are covered up by us.
Do the Tory journal readers
Find the truth of what occurred
Bluntly told in honest leaders ?
“ Mum’s ” the word !

Another Court scandal in an Australasian
province. This time, it appears, His Nibs has
loved not wisely nor too swell, but stooped to
conquer among the dolly-mops of his country

one cost over £4OOO for the christening.

Nothing has yet appeared in the papers
concerning the how-d’ye-do at Brisbane Govern-
ment House at the Auxiliary Squadron reception.
It is unlikely that the bleary-eyed M.L. A. who
ran amok on the occasion, ruffling the hair and
smacking the backs of judges and taking the
Admiral unto himself as a long-lost brother, will
again show up on the premises.

The committee of S.A. bicycle sports
meeting, held in Adelaide on Oct. 10, advertised
that they would absolutely destroy all dogs found
on the Oval. Only one dog made its appearance,
and the committee, with a murderous look in its
eye, captured it, and was about to destroy it by
44 successive pistol-shots, when a committeeman,
with his hair on end, spotted “Government
House” on the dog’s collar. The pistols were
put away, and the dog roamed about quite con-
tentedly, nearly bringing down the riders several
times. That’s all.

It is cabled that the London Times “ fears
that some of the best Australian wines are some-
times introduced as French wines, as entertainers
would scarcely venture to place Australian and
Cape wines before their guests.” This is likely
enough. Some years ago a member of the JN.&. W.
Agricultural Society, who was entrusted with the
catering of liquor for an association banquet, as a
practical joke denuded of their labels six or seven
dozen bottles of high-priced German hock a,nd
attached them to similar bottles of Australian
wine (costing 16s. per dozen) from the Hunter
River. The learned connoisseurs of the Agricul-
tural Society drank the wine, smacked their lips,
and were quite astonished to learn that such
excellent Rhine wine could be bought as low as
60s. per dozen. A similar trick was played on
Lord Norman by when'he governed Victoria.
The old man arose at the festive board, glass in
hand, and lovingly holding up to the light a bum-
per of Trouette and Blampied’s white wine (which
he accepted as from Germany), and said a day
migftt come when such a vintage would be gathered
in this fair land. (Loud cheers.)

A Sunnyside (N.S. VY.)State-school teacher
having been convicted of criminally assaulting a
young female pupil, and sentenced to eight years’
penal servitude, it is pointed out that three male
teachers have locally been convicted within a very
short space of time, and the suggestion is made
that only women should be allowed to take charge
of mixed schools. The Bulletin suggests that
ere this step be taken as a specific remedy the
records of the Victorian Education Department
in such matters be attentively studied.

The death of Jules reminds a
Bulletin French correspondent of the scandals
with which his son-in-law, Daniel Wilson, was
connected. “The sale of decorations has long
been a fruitful source of income to certain politi-
cians in Paris. Soudry, who was shot by Greer,
In the Theatre Royal,' Melbourne, was connected
with a regular business of this kind. He and his
partner had sumptuous offices in a small street off
the Rue 4re Septembre, where they drove a
thriving trade. Michel Ephrussi, the Jew
banker, paid them 14,000 francs for a ribbon of
the legion of honour, and after the esclandre he
fave another 14,000 to have his name kept dark,
t leaked out notwithstanding, and Soudry
et Cie were convicted and sentenced to long terms
of imprisonment. Soudry told me that he was
merely the servant of certain Deputies, who used
their political influence to procure decorations
for anyone who could pay sufficiently well for
them. Soudry bears the mark of Greer’s bullet,
which injured some of the muscles of the neck,
and produced an involuntary bobbing of the head,
which reminds one of those small Chinese figures
which wobble their heads and put out their
tongues when moved.”

“Bob” Prendergast, the rich Sydney
brewer in whom the auri sacra fames burns
strongly ever since he missed buying a share in
Mount Morgan, has found in England a veritable
diviner who can infallibly indicate where gold h.es
concealed. She is a very charming young lady,
the daughter of a clergyman, and Bob met her at
a country house. Miss discovered her power
by mere accident. She was at some place in the
North where a water-diviner was at work, and
being much struck with what she saw, she got one
of the divining twigs and tried her hand. To her
astonishment it acted at once, and since then she
has frequently thus found water. On the occasion
when Prendergast met her he asked if she had
ever experimented with gold, and when she replied
in the negative he arranged to test her power.
He had gold with him, sovereigns or nuggets, and
secretly deposited some in several places. The
lady took her rod, and after wandering about for
some time, was able to mark the spot where each
piece of gold lay hidden. Everybody who saw it
was astounded. The test was perfectly bond fide,
and there was no suspicion of collusion. So much
impressed was Mr. Prendergast by the exhibition
of the lady’s mysterious power that he has made
her a tempting offer to visit Australia with a view
of utilising her skill in searching for the precious
metal. This is a true bill.

“ A drover’s life hath pleasures that towns-

They had camped for dinner just above Brewar-
rina, and some of the cattle unfortunately swam
across the river. Two of the men stripped and
took their horses over after them. Whether it
was the sight of two naked men on horseback, or
pure cussedness, the cattle “ cleared.” Just as
they were taking a wheel out of them on_tbe top
of a rise, the bullocks unaccountably shied off,
and to the consternation of the drovers, who are
naturally modest, they found themselves the un-
invited guests of a picnic-party of the elite of Bre-
“IN THE MADDING CROWD.”

A week or two back an aged party, placed
in Melbourne City Police Court dock “ under the
Yag.,” gave his age as 75, and at the same time
described himself as a “ Waterloo veteran,” thus
showing himself to have been a full-blown soldier
a year before he was born. The guileless Panton,
P.'M., swallowed the yarn, and gravely remarked
that “ something should be done ” for the suffer-
ing hero. We would suggest, for the guidance of
magistrates, and also as a hint to those blithering
old idiots wbo wish to pose as Wellington’s own,
that 00 years of age is about as low as a Water-
loo) an can now go. Why, very shortly, a Soudan
Contingent veteran will have to be at least 30 to

A strange story is going round concerning
a certain gubernatorial establishment somewhere
in Australia. There were two or more daughters
in it —the number of daughters doesn’t matter,
but one of them took music-lessons which were
supplied by a ponderous German professor.
Another, a younger one, was a little, kittenish
creature who often sat in an al fresco manner on
the stairs, and relapsed into day-dreams. She
was there one day when the professor came
down. She was dreaming and he was near-
sighted, so he fell over her with a yell and a crash,
snatched at her hair and her ears to save himself,
missed them and turned a somersault, and fled
wildly head-first into the hall. The Governor —a
real live Governor made of meat —looked out
from a door somewhere on hearing the din, and
the spectacle he saw paralysed him. There was
his daughter sitting on the stairs; and camping in
a dishevelled state in the hall was the professor
bowling at her in a whole variety of foreign
languages. Being shaken violently by the collar
and asked to account for his coarse expressions
the unfortunate man explained that he had fallen
over that horrid dog on the stairs. Being in-
formed that it wasn’t a dog but a young lady, he
found his lost eye glass and looked with a long,
wild look, and then with a shriek of horror he
burst out at the front door and fled for his life.
It is presumed that he has committed suicide ; for
a man who falls over and then swears at a
viceroy’s daughter there is no refuge except in
death.

A coolness has arisen between the ladies
who run the Austin (Vic.) Hospital and the local
bicycle club. The bicycle club for some time past
has got up a reputation for benevolence because it
used to come round in all the glory of its calves,
and its exaggerated breast-bone, and sing and
play to the patients. But after a while it began
to be asserted that the club really came round to
hug the nurses, and that it used to be found on
moonlight nights outside the nurses’ windows
singing love-songs, with a banjo and guitar, and
breathing forth its soul in harmony. Other
rumours have it that the club’s idea of benevolence
was to lay for some consumptive who seemed to
need cheering up, and bellow “rorty” nigger
songs in his last moments. Anyhow, the hospital
seems to hint that if the comes round
on its errand of mercy any more, it will whoop
for the police in short order and have these good
Samaritans thrown out of the front gate.

It has just transpired that New South
Wales subsidises the capture of deserters from
tbe Imperial navy by a reward of £5 for each
man caught. In other words, when a seaman,
tired of his dog’s life in a service which he entered
as a mere infant, clears out, goes to work, saves
a few pounds and gets married, the N.S.W.
Government pays out of the public treasury the
infernal sneak who drags the sailor-man away
from his wife and children, preparatory to his
being lagged for years in an English prison!
What does the democratic party intend do'ng in
this matter for the protection of Australian
women who may marry British naval absconders ?
* * *
One of the biggest attempts at political
organisation yet made in the Australias has been
initiated by a Southern association, who are
whipping-up their constituents to the tune of
20,000 circulars a week. The circulars are printed
at a Union office, but this concession is accounted
for by the consideration that the highest and
mightiest plutocrat in the organisation is the un
recognised boss of the printing-concern. The
envelopes in which the circulars are sent out are,
however, addressed by typists at the rate of ss.
per 1000 addresses. Now, a decent remuneration
for that class of work when performed on the
typewriter is 14s. or 15s. per 1000 envelopes. This
little circumstance will just show_ what the
Unionists may expect if the association becomes
top dog,
* * *
And, by the way, The Bulletin is glad
to hear that the Sydney typists are proposing to
unite to secure better remuneration, a higher uni-
form standard of qualification, and a general
“ elevation of the profession.” A Typists’ Union
will have the best wishes and support of The
Bulletin if it gives a cold shoulder to those
machine importers who are mainly responsible for
the market being flooded with scores of incom-
petent and cut-tbroat operators. And another
thing the Union will have to do will be to choke
once and for all the favouritism manifested by
certain Government departments towards some
typewriting concerns, which are bringing the
sweating methods of the factory and the laundry
into the ranks of a superior—heaven help it! —
profession.

A well-known recently-divorced Sydney

as correct, the world’s police experience show’s
that “ hundreds ” in the latter part of the sentence
quoted should read “ thousands.”

It will interest a lot of people to learn that

have postponed the happy event until after their

The Grand Orient of France has been
formally inaugurated in Sydney and has come to
stay. The motto of this order of Masonry (which

The hysterical Pastor Grubb, expounder
of the new East Lynne religion, says that no
clergyman should drink or smoke. “ Let any of
you Christians,” he adds, “ put a pipe of tobacco
and a glass of whisky before you and see if you
can ask the blessing of the Lord upon it.” Grubb
might as well say let any woman put a pot of tea
before her and see if she can ask God’s blessing
on that. Tea does far more harm in the land to
women than tobacco does to men. It turns ten
per cent of the women into querulous old hags.

Could I borrow the laverock’s lilting note,
Or the silvery song from the blackbird’s throat,
Then would I warble the whole day long,
Telling, in floods of passionate song,
How worlds might tremble, or skies might fall.
But Love, true Love, outlasteth all.
Or, with picturesque words, in phrases neat,
With ringing rhymes, and in sonnets sweet,
Had I the skill of the schoolman’s craft
My song the murmurous breeze should waft,
And tell to her whom my heart loves best,
How Love outlasteth all the rest.

The Prisoners at Pentridge are, naturally

punishment, and will be most detrimental to the
health of the men, especially those undergoing
long sentences. Think of a man being locked up

Some few years ago the R.C. Bishop of
Maitland had a high old time dining with thirteen
females—that is to say, the dinner-party consisted
ot fifteen, and thirteen of them were females,
and the other two were the Bishop and a clerical
friend of his. It was a painful situation for a
reverend father to be in. He had gone to Merriwa
to hold a Confirmation-service, and while there he
thought it would be the appropriate thing to
invite the committee and its wife to a hospitable
P res bytery. He meant it kindly, but
toe committeemen felt scared. None of them had
ever dined except in a rugged fashion at the
mtchen-table; they were accustomed to whack
the offspring in the middle of the meal, and
to reach for the victuals with their paws, and they
fli kn°w how to dine witli tiie reverend
j *?er. Therefore, unknown to each other, seven
Qt them were called away to' look for a lost cow,
and six had to go kangaroo-hunting, and thirteen
lone females rolled up to explain the situation.
The six women whose husbands were kangarooing
got on the spot first, and when the distracted
bishop was through with them there set in a
steady procession of six more whose husbands
were all away looking for a cow. Then there was
a pause, and the troubled father began to make
bets with himself a,s to what animal the remaining
committee-mam might be out pursuing, but just
then the thirteenth woman appeared coming
down the street, and her partner proved to be
after a cow also.

A Parisian firm of private detectives an-
nounces its terms for procuring the necessary
evidence in divorce-cases. They have a uniform
charge of 500 francs for securing the conviction of
a suspected wife, or 900 francs if they supply the
lover. It recalls to mind a little incident they tell
about a case— which, by the way, was patched up
out of Court —in one of the Australian capitals. A
very festive gentleman in high official circles, who
had made a love-match with a somewhat mature,
but (financially) charming, widow, was unfor-
tunate enough to awaken the suspicions of his
affectionate spouse. She had an interview with a
detective, and. with a lavish disregard of expense,
bespoke his closest surveillance. Less than a
fortnight later a cab brought the detective to her
door glowing with the pride of success. Madame
drove off with him, and in a few minutes, after a
little scuffle at a door in street, was confront-
ing her delinquent husband and her rival, a
fascinating little minx who seemed to look upon
the surprise as rather a joke. It was too much
for the injured lawful wife. With brandished
claw she sprang to the assault, and the “creature”
was in imminent danger of sustaining much
damage to her meretricious beauty, when the
detective interfered, and, pulling back the in-
furiated matron, excitedly whispered : “For
goodness sake don’t hurt her ! That’s my wife !”

Millicent, Marchioness of Stafford, is a
pretty little woman who did Australia with her
hubby five years ago in a trip round the world,
and then wrote a book about it, which she called
“ How I spent my twentieth year.” It is dedi-
cated to “ those who so hospitably entertained
and kindly instructed us,”and shows that the lady
spent her year in making cruel sketches of her
entertainers and instructors, and writing cruel
things about them. The illustrations are the
Marchioness’s own. After inspecting them, we
quite understand the following entry
I took sketches of S., Lord Carington, Francis, Mr.
Dailey, Lord Dudley, Mr. Moncrieffe, Mr. Williams, Mr.
Astley, and Mr. Sheriffe. Lady Carinyton had to go up
to Moss Vale to see the children.
Lady Carington had seen her guest’s sketches
before. The interest of the volume centres in the
patches of biography and personal description.
This sort of thing ;
Sir Alfred Stephen is an old gentleman of nearly
ninety, with charming manners and a wonderful
memory, with over seventy vrandohildren and great-
grandchildren. . . . Sir Thomas MTlvvraith, who is
interesting as being the first to annex New Guinea. . .
Lord Carington has a staff of very happy, very lazy, and
very pleasant young gentlemen. ... A big dinner
was given last night in honour of ... a gentleman
with a handsome wife and very tall daughters. . . .
Mr. Gillies, the Premier of Victoria, is rather an interest-
ing man. We had an animated discussion about fanatics,
and both agreed we liked them, and wished there were a
few more in the world, but from rather different points of
view.
On December 18 is a reference to a terrible case
going on in Sydney, in which six young men were
condemned to be hanged :
Lord Carington, who had to sit upon the Executive
Council all day, was much upset by it.
By what? The next evening the Government
House party sang part songs, and Lord Carington
accompanied them on the flute. Why has nobody
ever told Hop. all these years that Lord Carington
played the flute?

Here is a curious little item :
Jan. 26, Government House, Bombay.—ln the early
freshness of the morning we accompanied Lady Reay for
a ride by the sea-shore. ... I was mounted on a
nice little Arab; but as my saddle was too small and my
solar topee too large, I didn’t enjoy myself particularly.
Her ladyship certainly has a most embarrassing
way of taking the public into her confidence.
That sort of thing is all very well in the intimacy
of a diary, but when it comes to publication one
would have thought it sufficient to say the saddle
was too small without going into further parti-
culars.

STILL IN THE LEAD.
The great remedy for pain, St. Jacobs Oil, is a
wonder surely. But it is the result only of true
medical science and research. Such a discovery
had a right to prominence. It has cured wherever
used as directed. Founded upon the intrinsic
merit of each element, which, in combination,
proved to be the perfection of cure, its virtue has
made it what it is.
THE PEOPLE
of the United States know its name, and name it
as a remedy which should be in every house, for
every home know r s its value, as a sterling
comforter, the truest relief,
THE WORLD OWNS IT.
Canada took it up and adopted it as a standard
cure. It crossed the ocean, on demand, and alike
in Scotland, England, and Ireland, in the extremes
of climate and temperature, it is the same
sovereign Conqueror of Pain. Distinguished men
and physicians of South and Central America,
have used and recommended it, and sti'eet-criers
have sung its praise in verse in the streets of
Mexico. A member of Parliament
IN SOUTH AFRICA
praised it in open debate, and the same was done
by a U.S. Senator. In India it won its first gold
medal at the Calcutta Exposition, where expert
chemists and physicians awarded it its due; and
by merit it has won in all similar competitions.
One of the most distinguished scholars of Germany
thought it his duty to praise it, and such has been
its meed from Prelates, Potentates, and the Press.
A distinguished traveller comments on its use in
Egypt. It was Tire comforter and cure of the lost,
half-frOzen Arctic e'xplorefs of the Greeley expedi-
tion.
BRITISH SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.
It found its place in the knapsacks of the British
soldiers in the Soudan, and its permanent supply
to the medicine chests of her Majesty’s warships.
This would seem enough to show what it is
doing; but one other potent fact can’t be dis-
regarded. It holds its own as the best known
remedy of the age for rheumatism, neuralgia,
lumbago, sciatica, and all painful ailments. It
has taken its place in the trade of this continent,
and has received from many of its numerous
patrons throughout these colonies, as elsewhere,
statements that cures made by its healing virtues,
from the date of cure to the date of response,
embracing a lapse of years, have remained per-
manent without recurrence.
Sold by all chemists and dealers in medicine.

A POPULAR MISTAKE.
Many people have an idea that the Waterbary,
because a cheap watch, is therefore cheaply made.
A visit to the company’s factory, at Waterbary,
Conn., would decidedly alter this impression. On
seeing the extent and variety of the machinery
used, and the neatness, order, and organisation
there exhibited, you begin to realise that making,
a cheap watch (and a good one) is not by any
means the off-hand affair you had thought it was.
As you pass through department after department
and observe the working of wonderful automatic
machines, which make parts so fine you can
scarcely see them, and yet so accurate that they
can be taken at random and fitted together to
form a perfect watch ; as you note the handling of
the parts by dainty and skilful fingers, the
delicacy of the, process, and the thoroughness and
care as to every detail, you find it difficult to
imagine that they are not making hundred-doJlar
watches ; and you then become convinced that the
Waterbary is cheap, not because poorly made, but
because unique and simple in construction.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A “reliable” consultation yarn. A N.&.W.
man who used to live in pauper circumstances
with his family in a hut, drew the winning ticket in a
recent big consultation, and is now fooling away his
“ rise ” at the rate of £300 a week. He has bought 100
tickets in a Melbourne Cup sweep and is wagering odds
that he will win the boss prize, lie gave £50 towards a
local day’s races, and has distinguished himself by buying
three horses, all readied up, clipped, &c., for the occasion,
and all shicers - most of the local horses being able to run
rings round them ; and he is now wildly backing one of
his mounts to win the big handicap, he actually laying
the odds of £100 to £5. He has bought a hay-and-corn
store, into which he has installed as manager a circus-
clown whose show recently visited his locality. He is con-
stantly buying horses and turning them out to grass,
often never seeing them again. One horse is said to have
been sold to him three times already. He is constantly
surrounded by bloodsucking spielers.
# * *
That Nat. Gould (“ Yerax ”) should be able to
write an average sporting yarn was only to be expected,
but why on earth he should have written “A Double
Event” under the belief that Hawley Smart was a safe
guide, when so much peculiarly Australian and indi-
genous material w r as waiting to be dished up in a pecu-
liarly Australian and indigenous manner is a puzzle only
to be solved by the consideration that “Yerax’s” early
training impressed him with the conviction that Hinglish
sport, as Hinglish everything else, is a model for all
creation. Perhaps it is so, which will account entirely
for the blackguardism which, in spite of “Verax’s”
forced argument to the contrary, has pretty well
omnipotent sway over the Australasian turf. In
“A Double Event,” “Yerax” trots out the old
familiar Hawley-Smartian heroes and villains—the
foolish lord, the intellectual bookie, and the extremely
beautiful bookie’s daughter, who, in the social circle of
Don Juan house, unconsciously developes the unvarnished
grace of the best “ home”-bred girl, and the fascinating
elder lady with a page that mustn’t be read in the first
volume of her life’s diary—oh, we’ve had ’em before, a
hundred times! Also, the self-sacrificing trainer and the
jockey with a conscience—will anybody give us his
address?—and the amiabledetective who, somehow’, is never
to be run against in real life—it’s always the unamiable
one who runs against us. Yes, all the dear, old familiar
faces “ Yerax” paints for us, only instead of Epsom and
Ascot he gives us Randw’ick and Flemington, and he doesn’t
talk of Frith’s railway station, but only of Redfern and
Spencer-street, and instead of the Derby and the Oaks, we
get the Melbourne Cup, and in lieu of Lord Falmouth we
get the Hon. James White and Donald Wallace, and for a
change from Bend’Or and Hermit are favoured with Car-
bine and Musket and other of the equine heroes whose
pedigrees the rising Australian youth knows a great deal
better than he does the Lord’s Prayer. Now, the clever
little writer could give us a genuine Australian yarn if he
would kick himself free of imported hobbles. When he
does so, he will exclude the Peer of Hingland, who is
rarely virtuous except when he is an idiot; also the lady
with the mysterious page in her interior, who goes out
into the shrubberies at 11 o’clock on moonlight nights in
evening dress to sit down on mossy banks for the pur-
pose of preparing the bouquets for next morning’s break-
fast. plates and of being ruthlessly and quite unnecessarily
slaughtered by the sanguinary villain whom she had
thrown over when a great, pure love awoke in her heart
for the British Peer aforesaid—and so forth. “Yerax”
knows the Australian turfite as few know him, and, there-
fore, let him set to work and describe him as he is, not as
he would look, dressed as an English cad, in an imported
looking-glass. Further, when Nat. writes his next book,
let him make up his mind as to what he is going to call it,
and not send it into the world with three different titles.
And, finally, is it fair to the editor of the doubly-DEAD
Bird to call an English squire after him ?

As “ dead-birds ” are in fashion just now it
may be interesting to hear of one a Carlton boniface got
recently for a Melbourne suburban meet. Three ponies—
Lucius, Good Iron, and Fly, ran in one event, and—
“Don’t fail, old man, to put something on Lucius.”
Boniface didn’t forget, and Lucius carried his fiver at
evens. Good Iron won, but as the judge was out of his
box assisting the stewards in a squabble the race had to
be run again. Boniface shook hands with himself at his
let-off, borrowed £10, and put it on Good Iron, again at
evens. Besides, he remembered then that this same pony
had beaten a field of horses over the sticks but recently.
The race was this time won by Fly, the two other animals
having baked themselves with their efforts in the first
race, in which Fly ran nowhere !

Few Australians will be sorry to hear that
Ferris is a frost as a bowler this season. Not that any-
body objects to J. J. himself, for he is a good little chap,
but the dodging to work his qualification for the
“Graces’county’ disgusted every true lover of cricket.
He played for South v Noi th at Scarborough, and though
the wicket was made for him he could do nothing com-
pared with George Lohmann who took five wickets for
twenty-five runs. Murdoch, Ferris and Woods are all
playing for the “ Gentlemen of England ” at Scarborough.
This savours of farce, for though Ferris may possibly
have a qualification, it cannot surely be said that
Murdoch and Woods are bona fide entitled to be styled
as English gentlemen. Spofforth is clean out of it.

arrangement suggest? A unique chance in the law’ of
probabilities—almost as uncommon as the dealing out of
13 trumps in whist ? Or ?

At Rosehill the other day a mare owned by a
well-known metropolitan trainer fell, but luckily the
youngster on her back w as not hurt. When he returned
to the paddock, he received practical sympathy from the
trainer in the shape of a “ stern reminder” that horses he
rides should not fall, although the young’un has not yet
solved the problem as to how he is to keep them on their
feet. But one better comes from Bananaland. A wealthy
Queenslander owned a horse which fell in a race, and
severely hurt the rider. A bystander suggested that a
cab be sent for to take the poor fellow away, but Mr.
Owner looked quite hurt himself as he remarked that he
had already dropped enough money on the blanked
animal.
Carbine, at the moment of going to press, was
quoted at 200 to 1 for the Melbourne Cup. From which
we assume that either the old veteran moke is in a very
bad way, or that Donald Wallace is in a very good one.
The choice lies between the two. Possibly Carbine is
going to break all his baekers ; possibly again, Donald
Wallace is taking up all the money in Israel and is going
to break the bookmakers. It may be Carbine’s leg that
is swelled, or it may be his owner’s head. Anyhow,
Donald W. has been honest up to date.

A piece of Crown land in Pall Mall,
London, was recently leased at a rental based
upon a calculation that the capital value of the
site was half-a-million sterling per acre. This is
illustrative of the sinful enormity of any nation
parting with its earth possessions, which acquire
a value due solely to national progress and not to
individual enterprise.
The recently - deceased Australasian
Critic, a microscopic magazine edited by a large
variety of Melbourne University professors,
abounded in such gems as “consequently, there-
fore,” and “facts is what we want.” The Critic
would certainly have lived had not the cold-
hearted printer declined to accept “Odes to
Sappho”and “Symposia on the different means
of familiarising Australian bushrangers with the
Greek digamma ” in payment of his bills.
The West Australian, a daily journal
published in Perth, is now permanently enlarged
to four pages. This is the paper which Governor
Broome dubbed the “saving influence.” He
meant it, too, for the servile manner in which it
backed up Broome in his embroglio episodes was
remarkable. The “saving influence” surely is
departing from its “ respectable conduct ”
(Hackett’s favourite boast) when it publishes in
its issue of Sep. 23 nearly a column of Bulletin
matter unacknowledged.
An unconscionable amount of lying (writes
our correspondent) has been perpetrated about the
abortive attempt to float a loan of a million and
a half for New South Wales privately in London.
Notwithstanding denials, it is perfectly true that
attempts were made to engineer such a loan ; but
the thing was clumsily managed and failed.
Three well-known men in the city, one of them a
member of the firm of Mullens and Marshall, the
brokers of the Bank of England, undertook to
work the oracle, and they went to a few of the
biggest jobbers “ in the House,’’ who subscribed
a portion of the loan, some £50,000, some more at
a low price—97, ’tis said. But somehow the little
game leaked out, and the jobbers who were left
in the cold—some of them biggish men—took huff
and determined to “crab” the business, and suc-
ceeded so well that the project had to be aban-
doned. The whole story is an open secret in the
city, and forms a standing joke in the parlours of
colonial banks. Of course several good stories are
told of how the conspirators, when they thought
or knew the game was up, tried to “ have ” each
other, and one of them “ sold against ” his own
allotment. Of course this was found out, and
there are “ wigs on the green” between some of
the big firms. The fiasco has given unmitigated
pleasure to certain big people (who must be
nameless) connected with the colonial banks,
for they have put their heads together to
smash up any new Australian loan unless
it be carried out under their auspices. A
big N.S.W. conversion loan is inevitable, and it
will certainly be a matter of extreme difficulty to
borrow any large sum of money in England in the
present state of affairs. The ancient state of
things has passed away, never to return. It was
a good time for some people—old Westgarth, for
example. That leary old bird saw clearly that as
money became cheaper in England, and as the
colonies and their resources became better known
the time would arrive when colonial credit would
stand high in esteem. He accordingly bought any
amount of colonial stocks and subscribed for new
loans (with a syndicate behind him, of course) at
such a price that they were enabled to borrow
money on the stock and pay for it, whilst they
were drawing bigger interest by far than they
were paying. That is to say, they were able to
borrow from 2 to 3J per cent., while the bonds
were bought at a price which gave them in many
cases as much as 2 per cent, margin. If I
mistake not many of those who are now most
active in opposing colonial loans were members
of the syndicate which carried on this very profit-
able game. Time went on and at last the general
body of the investing public began to nibble at
colonial securities, the price went up many points
per cent, and the clever speculators cleared out at
a big profit, and realised enormous fortunes in
many instances. At last it became unprofitable,
and the business was dropped. Westgarth retired
from business a rich man, and within 12 months
of his death his firm was shaky. The game of
these old hands is plain—to decoy colonial loans,
and to run down colonial credit. The late shearers’
strike in Queensland, and the Labour victory in.
N.S.W. are the two stalking-horses which they
are working to alarm investors, and so far the
game has been successful enough. But when the
inevitable happens, when needy Treasurers are at
their wits’ end for money, and the necessity of con-
verting old loans, or paying them off—which will
be impossible—arrives ; when colonial credit.is at
its lowest, then will come again the tilth of the
successful engineers of Australian finance, and
large fortunes will once more be made.

Photographer Anaschentz of Lissa has
succeeded in making twenty-four separate pic-
tures, each showing half-tone and detail, of a
dog in the act of jumping over a small bush,
In some districts of West Australia, if a
blackfellow finds that during his absence his
better half has been misbehaving herself with
somebody else, and, should the case against the
defendant be clear, plaintiff and co-respondent
immediately disrobe, providing they have any-
thing to doff, and each man talces turn-about in
stabbing his neighbour with his spear. After one
has had as much as he can conveniently stahd he
cries go. Whereupon the victor, whether plain-
tiff or co-respondent, has to hand himself over to
the vanquished man’s brother or uncle and, with-
out retaliating, calmly receive from this in-
dividual enough stabs to equalise matters.
The latest W.A. gold-discovery is respon-
sible for some alarming local symptoms of
excitement. Several of the original prospectors
of this new find are reported to be piling tip the
gold in sacks. The locality of the alleged new
discovery, says a Bulletin' correspondent, is in
the Murchison district, about 300 miles from
Geraldton, and is a region practically waterless
and almost barren. The new field, strange to say,
.is not alluvial, and is confined to a small reefing
area, the stone from the surface being phenomen-
ally rich. Whether these reefs will go to any
depth is an open question, but experts think they
will pinch out immediately sinking is proceeded
with in earnest. The stuff obtained is “ specimen
gold ” not in the least water-worn, The few
who have the monopoly of the line of reef are
certainly in possession of large quantities of
“ dollied ” treasure. The two discoverers of
the field are reported, on apparently re-
liable testimony, to have “ no less than
£15,000 worth of the precious metal in their
possession! ” But it is unanimously agreed
that a rush to the spot at the present time
is little short of insanity. Already 500 men are
on the ground, only a dozen or so of whom are on
gold. The Government have just proclaimed the
field, and are sending out a warden.
The feast which has just concluded the
days of Atonement is observed nowhere more
religiously than in Darlinghurst Gaol, where the
Jew is the envy of the Gentile even as he is out-
side. A creed which inculcates good feeding
recommends itself to the strict observance of its
adherents far better than one which prescribes
maceration and abstinence. Sardines, salmon,
lobster, and herrings pour in wholesale to the
order of the chosen, and when such a phenomenon
as a destitute or impecunious Jew is met with
these kippered aids to devotion are supplied by
the Synagogue. After the Gentiles are yarded,
mustered, and celled, Israel is formed into pro-
cession, and with their bags of “ tommy ” slung
across their shoulders are marshalled into the
building used for their services. There they enjoy
themselves to their hearts’ content until as
late as 1T30 p.m., gorging themselves with these
unaccustomed delicacies and passing votes of
thanks to Moses. Then they are drafted off to
their respective wings, the opening of each
“peter ’’ awakening the smothered curses of hap-
less Christian prisoners who went to sleep on
hominy and dry bread, and who at this witching
hour experience an aching void and an unutter-
able yearning. There is a good deal of stern, un-
flinching eating enjoined in the law of Moses, and
if the old pebbles knew how to pass the rabbinical
scrutiny there would be many defections from the
One True Church. In addition to their gustatory
privileges, the children of Israel get the Christian
holidays as well as their own, they are appor-
tioned the lightest work, and their sentences are
fictitious.
The Right Hon. Viscount Monck, P.C.,
&c., &c., by his representatives, distrained for
rent the other day on a Sydney widow.
A prisoner at Darlinghurst occupying the
high and responsible position of barber, which is
an office of profit under the Crown, inasmuch as
he gets a special indulgence in the shape of
tobacco, (just as the N.S.W. Attorney-General
used to get fees plus salary,) was very recently in
trouble for having, ill concert with other “ retired
civilians,” committed a most brutal assault Upon
the son of an ex-Minister of the Crown who was
yarded with him. The tonsorial artist first
knocked his man down, then three or four con
federates closed in, and before any warder could
interfere, his principal assailant, who is in quod
for a precisely similar offence, gave him a brutal
kick in the eye, splitting the lid, and impairing
the sight. The victim was discharged the other
day after serving the full term, subject to good
behaviour. What was done with the barber, no
one knows or ever will know, save the suave and
coldblooded Minister of Justice. He may have
been flogged, or he is to be flogged, but the public
knows absolutely nothing of this subterranean
administration of alleged justice, that ought to be
dealt out in open daylight.
Dear Bulletin,— The N.S.W. Betterment
system taxes land-owners proportionately to the
good done them t that is most fair. The revenue-
raising ruse, adopted in clause 24 of the N.S.W.
Public Works Act, taxes those whose lands are
resumed in proportion to the good done all other
people . That is unfair and stupid. Let me illus-
trate : —A and B own two adjoining quarter-acre
allotments, worth, before the trouble, £40 each.
These allotments are equal in all things. The
railway takes away half A’s and does not touch
B’s allotment. B, of course, does not want com-
pensation, and A wants it, but does not get it.
Government says to A i “You lose £20 worth of
ground, but the piece left to you is enhanced
100 per cent.; that leaves you uninjured.” B’s lot
is now, on the same basis of enhancement, worth
£80. So, really, is not A taxed in proportion to
B’s benefit and not in proportion to his own? The
extraordinary consequences end not here. A re-
cognises that the half of a building allotment is of
no use to build on, and so it is practically lost to
him, though the Government arithmetic says it
ought to be as valuable as the quarter-acre was at
first. Please remember that no lots were ever
purchased here for the purpose of exacting an
exorbitant or any price from Government. I can
furnish oceans of proof of the bona-fides of these
lot-holders. Listen : B owned a lot on which was
a house. Government took one-third of his lot

Tales of the Old Regime.
No XV.—The Ross Gang “Varner"-ship,
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Chummy, yer’ll have to pitch us some-
think !”
“ ’Ear. ’ear!” came in a strident, ironical
chorus from the bed-places.
“ Hi, parson, stir yer pins !”
“ Hooray for parson ! Give us some preach in’,
old Devildodger!”
“ No, tip us a yarn, but sarmints be blowed !”
“ Aye, aye, Chummy, no sermon, but give us a
song.”
“ Vy, ’e can’t sing nothink but ‘ Hold Hun-
derd,’ and ‘ ’Vake my soul an’ with the sun.”
“ Well, old White Choker, yer’ll have to give
us something, quick, or we’ll make you run the
ranks ! You got to do something to pay your
footin’, if you won’t give us ‘ Franky.’”
“ Verily, dear Brother Snufflebuster, unless
thou art moved to speak quickly these thy
brethren in the System will be obliged to ad-
monish thee, and to inflict upon that mass of cor-
ruption, thy sinful flesh, the chastening hand of
affliction !”
“What, no answer? The right reverend
refuses to speak, pals ! What shall we do to
him? ’
“ It ’im hon ’is ’ead !”
“ Stand him on his head !”
“ Douse him!”
“ Make him dance the bayonets ! You’ve only
been out three months, and must have brought
the latest dance with you, parson, of course,
from home —home, sweet home !”
“ Sling him to the rafters !”
“ Rank him!”
“ ’Ear, ’ear ! Rank him, aye, rank him !”
And “ Rank him ! ’ had it. Even the advocates
of the bayonet-dance, popular though it was, were
less numerous than those who cried for the
“ranking” of the Reverend Arthur Athroyd,
M.A., sometime curate of All Hallows’, London,
who now stood in the middle of the dormitory of
Ross Probation Gang. And the vote being for
“ ranking,” instant preparations for the pastime
were set on foot.
# # *
Let us go back three mouths—to the time
of the Rev. Mr. Athroyd’s arrival.
When a newly-arrived prisoner was added to a
probation gang he was required to pay for the
honour and pleasure of being included in so choice
an assortment of scoundrelism. “Close” cor-
porations always exact premiums for admission
to the enjoyment of their privileges and per-
quisites, and that exquisitely-beautiful appliance
invented by the great Earl of Derby for eradicating
humane instincts from the convict nature, which
he called a probation-gang, formed a society
whose members were bound by the closest of all
ties, those created by a mutually-dependent vil-
lainy. The membership of most privileged bodies
is knit together by common interests of profit. To
that cementing power were added in the case of
a probation-gang the tremendous attraction of
mutual fear and mutual distrust—of an embittering
sense of wrong inflicted by a common enemy, the
System—of an incessant “study of revenge”
against the forces which directed the energies of
their foe—of a common hatred against all things
and all men—of a knowledge shared in common of
practices the vilest and crimes so scorching in
their horror that the very ink would dry upon the
pen that attempted to describe their true char-
acter. There was thus peculiarly good reason why
every new Probation Ganger should pay his
entrance-fee upon joining so select a circle. The
deeper the scoundrelism which dyed his co-mem-
bers, the more necessary it was that he should
qualify himself by the payment of “chummage”
or “garnish.” They would have to trust him so
much that it was only just and proper he should
trust them with as much as he could. They
placed their necks, so to speak, in his hands, and
by all principles of equity it was right that they
should have their feet on his neck. Great com-
fort is derivable from the consideration that if a
man can hang you, you can also hang him. It
precludes treachery for one thing—and the men of
the Regime always encouraged treachery and paid
pretty well for it.
Now, the Rev. Athroyd, M. A. (Oxon.), having
made the journey of 80 miles or so from Hobart
Town to Ross on foot and on the chain, and
having been the recipient at Oatlands and two or
three other “ stop-over depdts ” of delicate atten-
tions from the escort of soldiers and Field-police
which had left him shirtless, sockless, cashless,
hatless, and all but bootless —the corporal of the
guard who had discovered that Athroyd’s new
London-made Wellingtons were his own exact
measure, had generously presented him, in ex-
change, with a dilapidated, unpaired couple of
“ration’’-shoes—this ex-clergyman, we say, was
not in a position to pay any “footing” at all
upon his introduction into the Probation Gang
at Ross. The fact was almost at once made
apparent to the elder members —some seventy in
number —who looked with interest and excite-
ment towards the door as, half-an-hour after
“ lock-up ” one December evening, the ex-clergy-
man was thrust into the domitory, and they lost
no time in resenting it.
The cries of “New boy!” which greeted him,
had not died away before the voices melted into :
“A new Miss Nancy! Mary Jane! .Hurrah!”
and the echoes of these again, were still ringing
when the hawkings and vulture-cries changed into
a howl of disappointment.
“He won’t do ! Make him pay footing, then !”
And “Footing! Chummage! Garnish!” con-
tinued to resound through the rudely-slabbed
building till half-a-dozen of the more energetic of
the gang, who had “ run through ” the garments
of the miserable new-comer, were convinced that
he had not the worth upon his person of anything
negotiable to the value of a single “bit.”*
“Not a bit’s wuth on ’im, stow my lights!”
cried the gang-bully, captain by right of supreme
blackguardism and brutish strength. “Take
that, you mug, fur lettin’ ’em clear yer out before
yer got into the company of us gen’i’men ! ”
And a blow, which split lips upon whose
eloquence some year a-gone had hung the eager
attention of titled dames and damsels, followed
the words. It was the precursor of other blows.
And who shall say they were not deserved ? What
right had a new man to import himself into the
privileges and immunities of Ross Probation Gang
without paying the customary toll in person, in
coin, or in some negotiable article’ What right,
indeed!"
'• # •
The Rev. tMr. Athroyd. however, recoiled
from tfie blows—and moaned. Moaned, and then
uttered his first words.
“ Why, why do you treat me in this way ?
What have I done?’’
“ You’re not a Mary Jane!” answered the bully.
“You’re not a Miss Nancy !” shouted another.
“ You’ve no tin—nothing to pay your footin’!”
cried others.
“That’s not my fault!’’ the creature who had so
mightily offended the susceptibilities of the
inhabitants of the dormitory ventured to remon-
strate, in a whimper. “ I've been robbed.”
“Wot right ha’ yer ter be robbed?” demanded
the bully—Dalton—as he aimed another blow at
Athroyd, who evaded it.
“How could I ” The new-comer had got
thus far in self-exculpation when Dalton struck
him again—this time with force sufficient to draw
blood from the nostrils.
“ ’Ow could yer ? Wot’s that to us ? An’ 'ow
dare yer dodge my shot for yer peepers ? Take
this, an’ this, an’ don’t be a coward! Us don’t
’low no one as is cowards ’ere, do us, boys ?”
The manliness of this sentiment naturally com-
mended itself to the feelings of several other
gangers, who emphasised it so strongly and pun-
geritly that the “ new boy” dropped to the floor in
a semi-swoon. Then, and then only, was there a
lull in the cordial demonstrations which had wel-
comed him. For ten minutes or a-quarter of an
hour they permitted him to lie undisturbed, save
by his own tremors. At last he rose dazedly, and
stood or rather reeled in the centre of the room.
Already the bruises were showing on his features,
and his eyelids were swelling ominously over
watery eyes. The gang, half afraid that it had
gone too far, regained its vivacious temper and
its voice as they saw him struggle to his feet.
The bully re-opened the attack.
“ Now, ’ow his yer a-goin’ to pay yer shot?”
The ex-clergyman answered :
“ I’ll—pr-pray—for you 1”
* * #
The resulting roar of laughter was of such
volume that it brought the sergeant of the guard
to the peep-hole in the door. The merriment was
so genuine that, of course, it could not be allowed.
Only the ring of hearty laughter would have in-
duced the officer to emerge from the guard-room
snuggery. Cries of “Murder!” had more than
once burst after nightfall from the dormitorv, but
an enquiry into their origin had been postponed
till the morning. Laughter, however—genuine,
unforced laughter—was a very different thing.
The slide was well oiled—by virtue of a special
regulation—and it turned on its pivot noiselessly,
so the sergeant’s tones were the first intimation of
his presence.
“To your bed-places there—or I’ll fire!” he
shouted, and the gangers skurried to their lairs.
All except the “new boy.” His wits had barely
come back to him, and he was necessarily not yet
aware that a sergeant of the guard was a very im-
portant personage indeed, and entitled to be
obeyed on the instant. He retained his place.
“ To your bed-place there, No. 72, or I fire !”
The Reverend Mr. Athroyd knew he was “72.”
To that extent he was familiar with the System.
But as to a bed-place, none had been allotted to
him, and how could he go to one unless
His speculations were summarily terminated by
the passage of a musket-bullet through the calf of
his right leg. The Probation Plan was responsible
for many innovations into the System, but it did
not affect in the least the good old principles
which led the authorities to immediately resent
overt or covert disobedience. Once again the ex-
clergyman dropped to the floor.
It might have been the making of him
that trifling casualty—as Superintendent Argus
of the Ross Gang styled it in his monthly report
to the Comptroller-General For it kept him to
his bed-place for ten weeks ol so, notwithstanding
the many attempts of the Superintendent to get
him out to work. l( We don’t allow shamming
Abraham, parson !” that genial gentleman had
himself informed him. “Damn it, sir, under
Captain Wright at Norfolk Island I’d have had
you to work the very next week, had you pro-
voked a shot by insubordination there. But we’ve
got milk-and-watery now, thank your stars ! I’ve
a good mind to try you as it is. How’d you like
to work in trumpeter irons, parson ? Quite a kid-
glove touch about ’em, I can assure you—it would
remind you of the days when you pressed the
hands of London ladies !” But in spite of his
pleasant words, Superintendent Argus thought it
best to permit the “ parson ” to regain health and
strength—good spirits he could not —before put-
ting him to work. And the months which might
have been months of acute torture were only the
measurings of so much dull, dead pain.
The gang left him undisturbed by their refined
attentions for the time—although they were still
determined on compelling him to pay his footing.
In the day-time he was alone in the ward, save for
a chronic hospital case—a youngster who was
asthmatically puffing his life away—and frequent
“ transient” patients who were in for a day or two
while backs were going through the saline aijd salu-
tary process of healing. And in the night-time, he
was free of the gang also. Only that his spirit
quailed before the nameless horrors of the others'
nights, he would have been tolerably comfortable.
The transport, who was officially appointed
wardsman, and officially recognised as “yarner ”
to the gang, was won over to kindness by per-
mission to drink Athroyd’s ration of rum. As a
patient on spoon diet, two ounces of rum was
allowed Athroyd daily. Which Wardsman Twiss
not ungratefully absorbed.
“ Spiritu’s drinks ain’t good for yer, pa’son,
they’ll indoooe inflammashum.”
“ Perhaps so!”
“ And jest yer guv up yer grog, an’ I’ll put yer
up to gettin’ on purty well wi’ tn’ boys.”
Athroyd shuddered. God ! Had he, a gentle-
man, a scholar, fallen so low, as to feel the neces-
sity of getting on well with the “ boys !” But he
said nothing, and Wardsman Twiss did not
apparently notice his silence.
“ I’m due for a pass to work nex’ Monday
se’en nights, an’ th’ gang’ll want a yarner, w’en I
goes !”
“ Yes?” Athroyd felt an impulse of interest in
spite of himself, as he thought that perhaps,
perhaps, he might till the yarnership! Better a
thousand times the yarnership, with its disgusting
menial duties inside the dormitory, than work
outside in the hourly degradation of companion-
ship with “ the boys.”
“ Yes, that’s wot I think. Yer not a bad ’un,
pa’son, on’y a fool, an’ if yer guv up yer grog ”
“ Yes, yes, you can have it!”
“Didn’t I call yer a fool? Wot d’yer say I
c’u’d ha’ it fer till yer seed wot I wud swop for it ?
Yer are a fool.”
“ I trust you, you see !” said Athroyd.
“ Then, thet jist proves as yer’s a double-fool!
To trust a ganger 1 Well, thet’s rich. Ha! ha!”
“ But what —about the yarnership?”
“ W’y sh’u’dn’t yer take it? Yer know « lot
o’ yarns, an’ tales, an’ romances, don’t yer?” / v
“ I could tell some—many, in fact !” *
“Then w’en I’m gone, I’ll nom’nate yer—jest
out o’ pure likin’ for ver, pa Von. An’ there ain’t

* » *
Athroyd, steeped in the misery of his
stupor though he had been, had yet during his ten
weeks’residence in the gang-dormitory, perceived
that the yarnership, accompanied as it was by the
wardsmanship, was the most coveted of the billets
open to the transports. The nomination of their
own “yarner” was about the only opportunity
possible to the gangers of exercising their faculties
of choice and judgment, and was a privilege only
granted to them in order that the man whom they
selected might be bound by force of self-interest
to the Authorities. It always suited the Authori-
ties to so arrange that at least one man in every
gang should be in close touch with the prisoners,
on the one hand, and with themselves on the other.
By attaching the wardsmanship, therefore, to the
yarnership, and by filling the latter honourable
post on the nomination o the gang, The Authori-
ties generally killed two birds with the one stone
-they pleased, at no expense to the Government,
the prisoners ; and they, obtained for another a
ready, pliable tool possessing the intimacy w.th the
convmt nature so essential to the proper working
of the system.
* ' *
True to his promise—for he had nothing
to gain by breaking it—Wardraan Twiss began
that very day the work of preparing the way for
the assumption of the yarnership by the “Par-
son.” He had two things to do—one to instruct
Athroyd in the best means of gaining the atten-
tion of his audience, and the other to win the
suffrages of the gangers for his protege, in case
there should beany other aspirant for the position,
“ Wot d’yer know, pa’soh ? Tell us some yarn,
an’ I’ll see how yer’ll get on wi’ th’ boys ! ” he said
one morning just after “ gang to labour ” had rung
from the station bell.
Athroyd thought for a moment—ransacked his
memory for some stirring story—and could think
of nothing better than some poor weak narrative
of the mawkish order, with a moral in it, and a
good boy who became a clergyman, and a bad
man who was hanged, and so forth.
Twiss interrupted him after five minutes,
“ Didn’t I call yer a fool? To tell a yarn o’thet
kind to our boys ! Are yer looney, man ?”
Athroyd tried again. A battle story from one
of the histories this time, and he earned a little
more commendation.
“Thet’s better, but, lor’, one o’ those ’ll be
’nuff for a week, an’if th’boys want yer, yer’ve
to find a new ’un every night. Yer never knows
when they’ll make yer strike up.”
Athroyd’s heart sank. He was a University
man, but his culture was at fault here. His loads
of learned lumber did not qualify him to interest
a convict audience.
“Don’t yer know any murders, or hangin’s?
They’re alius ready fer ’em?”
No, Athroyd knew.next to none. His acquain-
tance with the Newgate Calendar was with its
cover only.
His tutor was disappointed. “I’ll ha’ to guv
yer up ! I can’t nom’nate a cove wot’s no good—
th’ boys ’ud never forguv me! Stay ” A
thought struck him. “Ha’ yer a purty good
mem’ry? Can yer git a thing by heart, quick-
like ?”
Athroyd thought he could. He would try, at
least, he said. . .
“ Then I don’t mind a-puttm’ yer up to I rank
the Poet’s Tower.’ They’ll take th’ Tower, th’
boys ’ll, mornin’, noon, an’ night. But don’t yer
guv it too frequent. I guvs it four times a year
—Easter-day, an’ Christmas-day, w’en we gets
the duff, an’ per’aps twice ’sides. But the boys ’ll
take it offner, and never get sick. A varse at a
time, and then one of yer own yarns, an’ the varse
’ll help ’em to bear t’other patient-like. Or guv
’em yer rubbage fust, and then the Tower.”
“ What is the Tower?” questioned the ex-clergy-
man. “ I never heard of it.”
“It’s Frank the Poet’s travel’s in ’Ell!”
“ Oh, ‘ tour ’ you mean !”
“ It’s his Tower I say, an’ if yer don’t like it any
way, yer shan’t ha’it at all,” rejoined the offended
treasury of Frank’s precious verses. “ Yer’ll say
Tower, or I’ll not put yer up to it.”
And Athroyd could only make his peace by
consenting to substitute Twiss’ pronunciation for
his own.
* * •
On the Sunday before Twiss would lay
down the honours and emoluments of office, he
had determined to test the feeling of the gang
towards the,appointment of Athroyd, who, by
this time, by dint of much thought and applica-
tion, had contrived to memorise his version of
Twiss’ version of Frank the Poet’s famous “ Tour
through Hell.” Twiss waited till after dinner to
mention the matter, well knowing that he would
be called upon for a yarn to drive away the som-
nolence induced by that specially luxurious meal.
The gang were always sleepy on Sunday after-
noon. The alteration in their ration from 12
ounces of meat, boiled to a soup, to 16 solid
ounces (including bone) of “roast,” naturally
suggested the afternoon nap of happier and freer
Sundays, and therefore the System insisted that
they should not go to sleep. If they did not road
the Bible, or “ a good book,” they might listen to
a yarn, but go to sleep they should not.
Well, the gang did insist. “ Bully ” Dalton
called out for a yarn. “ An’ it’s yer las’ Sunday,
ol’ pal—so chuck us ‘ Franky.’ ”
“ ’ear, ’ear, ‘ Franky’s Tower !” was the sincere
chorus. Tower—for the last time,
Twissy !”
Twiss took his station at the end of the dormi-
tory—the hospital end—and held up his hand for
silence. The congregation at St. David’s Cathe-
dral in the capital that afternoon were not more
devout.
“Now, I wants to tell yer, pals, that I’ve a
per —posishun to make !”
“ Never mind thet. Give us ‘Franky !”
“ If yer don’t want a Darlin’ necklacef ’n yer,
yer’U hold yer tongue, my flash cove !” threatened
the yarner to the interrupter. “My per—
posishun is to do Franky if yer’d shet up!”
Half-a-dozen blows were aimed at the disreputable
fellow who had interfered with Mr. Twiss’ plans,
and Mr. Twiss went on.
“ My per-posishun is this, that as I’ve to leave
yer, dear boys, yer’d better guv my billet to th’
man ’mong yer who knows all ‘Franky’s Tower!’”
There was a burst of “ Hear, hears ! ” and then
—a dead silence. On second thoughts, who was
there among them all who knew the “Tour”
except the man who was about to resign ?
“ Yer don’t know enyone, don’t yer? ” Twiss,
rejoicing at the effect of his words—he really had
a sort of regard for that poor weakling, the parson,
—went on. “Now, I does know one of yer as does
know the Tower off by ’art! But will yer ’lect
him?”
“ Yes, yes ! ” roared from three score voices.
“Then, pa’son—pa’son Athroyd, stand ycr
forth ! ”
And, leaning upon a rude crutch which Twiss
had made him from a broom-handle, the ex-clergy-
man limped into the middle of the room. He
held his hand to his heart—the spasm of shame
which seized him at being thus the object of
distinction to an infamous crew, had nigh stopped
its beating.
# # #
The surprised gangers were as good as
their word. They elected him unanimously to the
yarnership as soon as he had demonstrated his
familiarity with the convict-classic, and generously
forgave him his “footing.” He recited to them
the introduction only that day, however. “He
shan’t guv it yer all at once, genTmen,” quoth
his patron, “an’ye’ll ha’to’sense his narvusness
this ’ere day, ’cos that’s only natural w’en a cove’s
blushin’ honors are thick upon him.” An admir-
able and magnanimous sentiment that was rap-
turously applauded.
The portion he recited that day, taking care-
how the trifling concession stung him ! —to suit
Twiss’ views in the matter of the pronunciation of
“Tour,” was this ;
You prisoners all of New South Wales,
Who frequent watch-houses and gaols,
A story now to you I’ll tell—
’Tis of a Poet’s Tour to Hell.
On the highway before he died
Our hero’s valour oft was tried ;
At length to Death he fell a prey—
To him it proved a happy day.
Downward he bent his course, we’re told,
Like one destined for Satan’s fold,
And no refreshment would he take
Till he approached the Stygian lake,
And thinking no one would molest him
He stood—when Charon thus address’d him.
“Stranger! Art thou friend or foe?
Thy business, too, pray let me know.”
“ Kind sir ! I come from Sydney Gaol.
My name I mean not to conceal;
And, since you desire to know it,
On Earth I was called “ Frank the Poet.”
“ Are you that person?” Charon cried.
“ I’ll ferry you to yonder side,
And, stranger ! do not troubled be—
I’ll grant to you a passage free !
A fee of sixpence is my charge
. t For the passage in my barge ;
But, noble guest! I’d' have you know it,
I never mean to charge a poet.”
This canto—and the next, in which the Poet
. . . Leaving Charon at the ferry,
Went direct to Purgatory.
he recited that first day. Beyond that he would
not gratify them. And when he left off, they were
eager to hear more.
# * #
“ They’ve made you Yarner !” exclaimed
Super. Argus next day. “ Made a parson
yarner ! Lord, what a joke !” He paused to have
his laugh out. “But you can have the wardsman-
ship, vice Twiss, due for pass—on one condition,
No. 72.”
“ Yes, sir! ”
“ That you don’t preach to them and make ’em
too saintly.! ” And he went away to tell the
subaltern of the guard—Ensign Chick—that his
superlative scoundrels had chosen a parson for
their yarner.
“Jupiter, he’ll give ’em the Acts of the
Apostles some day, Chick ! ”
* ' # *
But, nothing of the sort.
. Most of the gang had heard the “ Tower ” half-
a-dozen times from Twiss, but Twiss had never
known but a garbled version of the poem. He had
himself received it orally from a convict as
illiterate as himself, and the clever verses had
become prettily mangled in transition. Athroyd’s
scholarship, however, had enabled him to restore
the text, and the gang welcomed his rendering as
though it were altogether novel to them.
During the first day of his appointment as
wardsman, he carried in his recital Frank to the
very Gulf of Hell, and told his hearers how
Frank —
Having found the gloomy gate
Loudly knocked to know his fate.
Then fonder knocked —and louder still.
Till Satan came, “ Pray what’s your will ?"
“ Alas !” said Frank, “ I’ve come to dwell
With you—and share your fate in Hell! ”
Cried Satan: “ That can’t be! I’m sure
For I detest and hate the poor.
And none shall in my Kingdom stand
Except the wealthy and the grand.
And, Frank, I think you’ve got astray
For convicts never come this way !
But soar to Heaven, in droves and legions.
A place, so called, in the upper regions.
And, Frank, I think, with an empty purse,
You might go further and fare worse ! ”
How they cheered at this point!—it was after
tea on the Tuesday—and how they bent forward,
intent to lose no word of the Poet’s response to the
Chief Ruler of the System :
“ Well,” cried the Poet, “ since ’tis so,
One thing from you I’d wish to know ;
As I’m at present in no hurry—
Have you one here called Captain Murray ?’’
“ Yes ! Murray’s here ! Within this place ;
Perhaps you’d like to see his face ?”
“May God forbid that I should view him ;
Aboard the Phoenix hulk I knew him.
But who is that in yonder blaze,
On fire and brimstone seems to graze?”
“He ? Captain Logan, of Moreton Bay ;
And Williams —killed the other day.
He was overseer at Grose’s Farm,
And did you convicts no little harm !
Cook, who discovered New South Wales,
And he who first invented gaols
Are together tied to a fiery stake
That stands in yonder boiling lake.
Hark ! Hear you not that dreadful yelling ?
It conies from Dr. Warden’s dwelling.
And yonder see those fiery chairs,
They’re fitted up for beaks and mayors.
And” men of judicial orders,
Barristers—lawyers and recorders.
And how they made him repeat the next canto,
twice and thrice :
Then Frank beheld legions of traitors,
Hangmen, gaolers and flagellators,
Commandants, constables and spies,
Informers, and overseers likewise.
In flames of brimstone they were toiling,
And lakes of sulphur round them boiling !
Hell resounded with hideous yelling
Alas ! How dismal was their dwelling.
Then Major Morriset he espied
With Capt. Clunie by his side,
In a fiery belt they were lashed together
As tight as sole to upper leather !
Their situation here was horrid -
They both were tyrants to the Nor’ard.
Next he beheld old Sergeant Flood
In Vulcan’s hottest forge he stood.
He gazed on Frank—his eyes with ire
Appeared like burning coals of fire 1
He by a bloody collaps'd band
Was to a lofty lamp post chained.
With fiery garments all arrayed,
Like a wild Arabian ass he brayed,
Loudly he implored from Frank assistance
To end for him his sad existence.
“ Cheer up !” said Frank, “ don’t be dismayed,
Remember No. 3 Stockade.”
Twice and thrice they made him recite that, and

pattern invented by Governor Ralph Darling for Private

547 George Street (war Liverpool su, Sydney.
they encored him as fervently when, on the Wed-
nesday, he related how, to Hell’s door,
Drove up post haste a coach and four,
And about six feet of mortal sin
Without leave or license, tumbled in.
And how—
At its arrival three cheers were given
That reached, at least, the highest heaven
And all the inhabitants of Hell
With one accord rang the great bell
That never was known to sound or ring
Since Judas sold our Heavenly King.
Drums were beating, flags were hoisting,
Never before was such rejoicing—
Dancing, singing, joy and mirth,
In heaven above, or on the earth.
Straightway to Lucifer Frank went
To learn what these rejoicings meant ?
“ Of sense,” cried Satan, “ I’m deprived
Since Governor Darling has arrived !
Fire and Brimstone I’ve ordained him,
Vulcan has already chained him.
But their pleasure at the tortures heaped upon
poor Darling was feeble, compared with their
delight when Frank dealt out to his and their
class that happiness which the plain prose of life
refused the convict. When he recorded the fiat
that
Although in convict costume drest,
Heaven hailed Frank as a welcome guest;
and described the welcome in detail, they laughed
and cheered so as to bring the Sergeant, the
Ensign, and the Super, to the peep-hole. Nor in
their delight did they notice that their orator
could not force himself to utter—the conventions
of his profession still holding him closely—the
irreverent lines: —
Enoch ! Go with him to Job—
And put on him a silken robe.
St. Paul! Go to the flock straightway
And kill a calf or two to-day,
And tell Abraham and Abel
In all haste to prepare the table—
They heaved deep sighs of regret because, after
Frank had shaken hands with many saints from
foreign lands; and after the curfew had rung
“through Heaven’s Concave,” and “hymns of
praise had been loudly sung after the Poet had
thus “glorified his theme,” that
He should awake and find it all A Dream.
* * #
That grieved them.
They enjoyed the tour as every generation of
convicts enjoyed it —enjoyed it, because it wafted
into their nostrils the sweet incense of a revenge
which would be all the sweeter because they would
relish it from the Heaven that seemed so distant
from the regions controlled by the men of the
Regime.
# # #
But—Frank’s Tour was only a dream, and
Super. Argus was a reality. And when Super.
Argus discovered (though the spy-hole) what was
the main burden of the Rev. Mr. Athroyd’s
recitals, there was a row.
“ Don’t you know, sir, that that is a grossly-
insubordinate effusion ? ”
Athroyd pleaded that he had not so regarded it,
but his pleas were swept aside as they deserved to
be.
“To-morrow morning you’ll be tried and
you’re removed from the wardsmanship, d’ye hear.
You’ll be lucky if I let you off with thirty-six and
the stone-heap.”
That was on the Saturday night of his first
week in office.
« # *
On the Sunday—the day being kept holy
as per regulation—the Reverend Mr. Athroyd
received an illustration of his luck—36.
And on the Monday, he received a further
illustration of it by being sent to the stone-heap.
On the next Sunday, no other yarner having
been appointed—that billet had been kept open,
by common consent, though a new wardsman had
been placed in charge—the gang called upon him
to repeat the “ Tour,”
“ Yer not in a billet now 1 ” cried Bully Dalton.
“ Ah’ yer’ve been catted wunst, an’ arter th’
wunst it don’t matter ! ”
Athroyd bad manhood enough left to shake
his head.
Then the gang treated him as we have told in
our opening paragraph. He had not paid his
footing, they said.
To rank a man was to make him “run the
gauntlet.” Limping, he was forced up and down
the doubled ranks while they struck him and spat
upon him. Athroyd had been whipped—and he
was such a fool that, having been once in official
favour, he could not keep in it—and therefore he
was a thing to be trodden upon —kicked—outraged.
But there was this consolation for him —it was
not the first nor the last Sunday afternoon spent
similarly by the Ross Probation Gang. The Ross
Gangers often used to keep themselves awake on
Sunday afternoons by “ ranking ” a new-comer.
The more refined the new-comer, the more delight-
ful the pleasure.
PRICE WARUNG.
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man—imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh,
proprietor, late of the Occidental Hotel, San
Francisco.*
A San Francisco pressman summed up
the Jackson-Corbett scrap in one sentence :
“ Yesterday Jackson was the coloured champion
of the world. To-day he is only a nigger.”
THEY ROLLED ON THE FLOOR.
On Monday, November 24th, 1890, the American
papers published the following news item :
“Mrs. Sarah S. Hensler, of No. 873, East One-
Hundred-and-Thirty-fourth-street, New York,
shot and killed herself yesterday morning. She
was a lady of excellent character and high social
position, and a member of the Rev. Dr. Ramsay’s
.Presbyterian Church. She was well-to-do and
very active in various public and private charities.
Since last July she had suffered fearfully from
indigestion and dyspepsia, which brought on
melancholia, and then a kind of insanity, under )
the influence of which she took her own life.”
Here is another story, not so tragical, but with
the same moral. The narrator tells it of himself.
“Mostly,” he says, “we dread and fear death,
yet once I prayed to die, and the reason was in
this wise. Up to Christmas, 1888, I had been a
healthy man, but at that time (a period of rejoicing
with so many) I felt depressed, languid, and tired.
My appetite left me, and I was much distressed
after eating the lightest food. My skin and eyes
became tinged with a dark yellow colour, and the
kidney secretion was like blood. The pain in my
stomach was almost unbearable and often lasted
from 12 to 14 hours without intermission. Some-
times I was in pain night and day, and was so bad
that my wife had to sit up with me through the
night. I was constantly sick, and troubled with |
a stomach cough, and expectorated a quantity of
green phlegm.
“In spite of warm clothing and every comfort, j
I was always chilled; the cold shivers running
through me as if my blood were thin and poor. 1
could take no solid food ; I lived on soups, milk,
puddings, &c., and after each meal I had empty,
gnawing, windy pains at the stomach, which
nothing relieved.
“ After a time an intolerable itching of the skin
spread all over me, as if my blood were poisoned.
Our family physician attended me for about a
year. Acting upon his advice I went to Harro-
gate, where I consulted another doctor, and drank
the waters, but feeling worse I returned home.
The bath attendant at Harrogate and others told
me I was suffering from blood poisoning, but this
the doctors never mentioned. The first doctor
said it was the passing of gallstones that gave me
such dreadful pain.
“ I now consulted an eminent specialist at Man-
chester, who confirmed what the other doctor had
told me, but none of them afforded me any relief.
“In this miserable way I dragged on for six
months more, and became so much reduced I
could scarcely put one foot before the other, and
so thin that the rings fell off my fingers and rolled
on the floor. I was in such pain that I prayed to
die, and one of the doctors told a friend of mine I
could not recover.
“In August of last year (1890), whilst my suffer-
ings were at the worst, a book was sent to mo by
post, telling of a medicine called Mother SeigeLs
Curative Syrup. I determined to try it, and sent
to Mr. Evans, Chemist, Lymm,- for a supply.
After taking the first bottle, I felt a little better,
and by persevering with the remedy I recovered
my appetite, and gradually gained strength. My
natural colour is now returned, and I feel as well
as I ever did in my life ; in fact, as well as I did
when a boy. I can eat any kind of food without
inconvenience, and have gained 30 pounds in
weight during the past three months. I may add
that previous to taking this medicine I was so
much altered that my friends, and even my pupil?,
scarcely recognised me. I tell every one what
Seigel’s Syrup did for me. ”
The gentleman who makes the foregoing state-
ment is a person of position and known to all the
people of Lymm. He declines to permit the publi-
cation of his name, but the perfect truth of what
is here related is vouched for by Mr. J. H. Evans,
the chemist above named. _ , •
The case was an aggravated one of indigestion
and dyspepsia and its natural consequence. The
whole system had been poisoned and disordered by
the acids engendered by the fermentation in the
stomach, and, had not Seigel s Syrup come to the
rescue just as it did a fatal result must have
followed in a brief time.


MERELY THE TRUTH.
They have merit.
The fact is indisputable.
The proof lies in the free samples.
It is not enough to say they sometimes fail.
They are of human produce, and therefore fallible.
The real facts are—
Do they cure diseases of the blood and skin in the majority of in-
stances? Undoubtedly they do.
Do they undo the effect of a chill or congestion, by bringing about
normal conditions of health ? Yes, they loosen and disperse the congestion.
Do they permeate the blood aseptically, so that bacilli and germs
cannot multiply and the growth of disease is checked ? Yes, they do.
Do they confer relief, assuage pain, and benefit the general health,
even when they do not cure ? Invariably, yes.
Do they act as a natural healthy laxative, rendering them especially
valuable to women and children, and to men of sedentary habits of life or
business ? Yes, by tonic action only.
Do they free the inner skin pores and intricacies from taint, clearing
off eruptions and improving the complexion ? They do.
Does their palatable taste and safety render them pre-eminently a
family medicine? Yes, for neither the mind nor stomach rebels against
them, and children like them.
Are they the best of all blood purifiers and the most valuable of all
spring cleansing medicines ? Yes, they are.

citizen
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the publi to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.

Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed

ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this

pure tonic. Try it.

TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

from the undersigned :
‘‘ I have for many years been obliged to take

Baby Miguel.
11 You kuo\V,” said Manuel, “ \Vhat a sotrowfiil
day for Tarragona was the 28th df June, 1811.
But ydu cattnot imagine the horrdrs attending
the taking Of the city. You did not see five
thousand Spaniards perish in ten hours ; yml did
tidt see houses and churches in flames ; you did
hot see miatmed old irteil Und helpless woolen
Slaughtered in cold blood ; you did not see the
ttlodesty Of maiderts, the dighity Of matrons, the
Sahctity Of nulls outraged. You dirt nOt see
jlillage and drunkenness mingling with lust and
Ihurdef. You did not see, in short, one of the
greatest exploits Of the conqueror of the world,
the herd Of oilr age, the demi-god Napoleon !
“1 saw it all! I saw tile sick rise from the bed
of suffering, dragging after them theit sheets, like
sHrduds, to perish at the hands of foreign soldiers
oh the threshold over which the day before had
passed the Viaticiirti! I saw lying in the street
the body of a woman they Had slaughtered, and
at her side her infant still nursing at its dead
jhothet’s breast. I saw the husband, with hands
tied together, witnessing the dishonor of his wife;
cliildreii weeping with tetror at the horrors that
surrounded them ; despair and innocence taking
refuge in suicide ; impiety insulting the dead.
“Dangerously wounded and unable to take
further part in the conflict, I fled for refuge to
Clara’s house.
“Full of anguish and terror, she stood at the
window fearing for my life and risking her own to
see me in case I should chance to through the
street.
“ I entered and fastened the door, but my
pursuers had already caught sight of Clara —and
she was so beautiful !
“ They saluted her with a roar of savage joy and
a burst of brutal laughter. A moment more and
the door would yield to the axe and the flames.
We were lost !
“Clara’s mother, carrying in her arms her year-
old babe, led us to the cistern or reservoir of the
house, which was very deep and which was now
dry, as no rain had fallen for several months, and
there we concealed ourselves. This cistern, the
floor of which might measure some eight yards’
square, and which was entered by a steep under-
ground flight of steps, narrowed, toward the top,
like the mouth of a well, and opened into the
centre of the courtyard, where a breast-work was
built around it, above which two buckets were
suspende i from hooks attached to an iron bar for
drawing water.
“The child I have spoken of, whose name was
Miguel, was Clara’s brother, that is to say, the
youngest child of the unhappy woman whom the
French had just made a widow.
“In the cistern we four might find safety.
Seen from the yard, the cistern seemed a little
well. The French would think we had made our
escape by the roof.
“ They soon declared that such was the case,
uttering horrible oaths while they rested them-
selves in the shady yard, in the centre of which
was the cistern.
“ Yes, we were saved ! Clara bound up my
bleeding hand, her mother nursed Miguel, and 1,
although I was shivering from the chill which
had followed the fever caused by my wound,
smiled with happiness.
“ At this moment, we noticed that the soldiers,
wishing, doubtless, to slake the r thirst, were
trying to draw water from the cistern in which we
were concealed.
“ Picture to yourselves our anguish at that
instant!
“ We drew aside to make way for the bucket,
which descended until it touched the floor.
“ We scarcely dared to breathe.
“ The bucket was drawn up again.
“ ‘The well is dry ! ’ cried the soldiers.
“‘There must be water upstairs !’ exclaimed
one.
“ ‘They are go ng aWay !* we all said to our
selves.
“‘What if th-y should bo c moc.aled ill this
well ! cried a voice iu Catalan.
“It was a i'enegadc !—a Spaniard who had be-
trayed us !
“ ‘ What nonsense ! ’ responded the Frenchman;
* they could not have got down there so suddenly !’
“ ‘ That is true,’ responded the renegade.
“ They did not know that the cistern could be
entered by an underground passage, whose door
or trap, carefully concealed in the floor of a dark
cellar, somewhat distant from the house, it would
be almost impossible to discover. Wo had, how-
ever, committed the imprudence of locking the
iron grating which cut oflf the communication
between the cistern and the passage, and we could
not open it without making a great deal of noise
“ Imagine, then, the cruel fluctuations between
hope and tear with which we had listened to the
dialogue carried on by those, wretches on the very
brink of the well. From the corners in which we
were crouching wo could see the shadow of their
heads moving within the circle of light on the
floor of the cistern. Every second seemed to us a
century.
“At this moment the babe Miguel began to cry.
“But at his first whimper his mother silenced
the sounds that threatened to betray our hiding-
place, pressing the infant’s tender face into her
bosom.
“‘Did you hear that?’ cried someone in the
yard above.
“ ‘ I heard nothing,’ responded another-.
“ * Let us listen,’ said the renegade.
“Three horrible minutes passed.
“ Miguel struggled to get his voice, and the
more closely his mother pressed his face into her
bosom, the more violent Were bis struggles.
“ But not the slightest sound was audible.
“‘lt must have been an echo !’ exclaimed the
soldiers.
“ ‘ Yes, that was it!’ assented the renegade.
“And t-cy all took their departure, and we
could hear the noise of their steps and the clanking
of their sabres slowly dying away in the direction
of the gate.
“The danger was passed !
“ But, alas ! our deliverance had come too late.
“ Baby Miguel neither cried nor struggled now.
“ lie was deqxl!”

Tile Spanish papers tell of tile deatli of a
priest named Laforga—the Stratigest and wildest
fathet who ever liVed ill the Pehitlsula. He WaS
a brilliaiit preacher, and tail half-a-dozen brpllall-
flges at his own expense. J'lvety waif and stray
bf the city he Was willing to take in and provide
for ; he found food and work for almost everybody
Ivho was dead broke and hungry ; lie read the
burial-service over suicides, heretics, and dead
ladies of easy virtue Whom no other priest Would
bury, and “ shouted ” the tombstone if necessary ;
and wherever there was pestilence or any other
trouble he rolled up. When money ran short for
these works of charity he went out to nocturnal
dives, and gambled and drank furiously, and
whether the holy man stacked the cards or not he
made it fearfully hot for the ungodly. His chief
recreation was haunting the back regions of the
theatre, and hugging the ballet-girls; he also
attended bull-fights and fought sundry duels. The
Church dropped on him heavily, but he told it to
go to perdition, and his congregation raised such
a dust on his behalf that he always got through.
He did more good, and saw more dubious girls
home late at night, and won more money at cards,
and painted Madrid a brighter red than any other
priest on record ; and when he died all the poor
and the hungry, and most of the bull-fighters,
gamblers, and ladies who wore tights and had
several husbands came and wept bitterly over his
dust.

Edison’s talking doll, at the toyshops, says
four lines of infantine poetry.
The New York Sun tells tile latest stbry
df the liystetical and Irresponsible fenidle the one
who gets up the Momlt Rennie otitl-age story,
aild tells Sensational roiliancea about inen with
blackeried faces who have waylaid het, and cut off
Her hair, and otherwise distinghishes herself. In
the present instance the girl’s trohble was caused
by anonymous letters. They cattle in shoals to
her and to her friends —letters iri feigned hand-
writings, in which some base deceiver maligned
her character and cast all manner of foul asper-
sions at her. The detectives toiled in vain to get
on the track of the miscreant who had done it,
and while they were toiling the girl faded away
with worry and anxiety and grief; and died.
Her last hours were full of pathos; she
lay on a little white bed, with her weep-
ing friends around her, and forgave her un-
known enemy, and then her voice grew fainter
and her lungs gave out, and she passed away.
Afterwards her bereaved father overhauled her
desk, and found the original rough drafts of the
letters, together with some notes from another
hysterical girl of the same order in which she—the
other hysterical girl—promised to copy them out
for her, and post tin in. The deceased had written
them all herself, and 1 1 ad died through living up
to the character of the persecuted saint; in other
words, she had tried to pine away a little, and to
fade somewhat, so as to keep up the part, and she
had inadvertently fadtd too much and peri lied
through it. Her heart was broken on account of
the aspersions she cast on her own character, but
even in her last moments she kept the circus
going, and her end was put in a Sunday-.'chool
book for the benefit of the young before she was
found out.
