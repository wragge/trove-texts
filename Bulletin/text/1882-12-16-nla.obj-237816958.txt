Political Pilgrimages.
In the Ages of Faith there were “ Pilgrimages of
Humiliation,” made by great sinners whose hearts
had been torn by great sorrows. These proud and
stricken ones —who had feasted and drunk deeply,
lived in lust and license, and mocked poor men’s
griefs—when they felt the hand of affliction upon
them, laid aside their robes of State, flung away
their goblets, and, putting on the weeds of
sorrow, “with coronals of violet, ivy, and pine,” set
out upon travels of ignominy—courting contempt,
and begging for obloquy as for a distinction. In
this way they hoped to efface the stains of sin,
and to cleanse themselves in a bath of public
penance. It was a dreadful ordeal; but the
sentiment of the times made it, we fancy, more
tolerable than such an experience could be in our
days. There was necessarily a tenderer com-
passion for human infirmity, and a deeper and
more widely-pervading sense of our common sin-
fulness than in these times, when most of us, who
are not actually found out, regard ourselves as
preparing our titles for future canonization.
• • •
It is, therefore, to the credit of Sir Henry
Parkbs that in ransacking the institutions of the
middle ages—to which remote epoch he perhaps
wont for a ground for the dissolution he recently
advised and obtained —he has discovered and imme-
diately put into practice the institution to which
we have referred. He has resolved upon and has
carried out a pilgimage of humiliation. Cer-
tainly, no man required the chastening and sub-
duing influences of such a discipline more than he
himself; but, with a kindly feeling towards his
colleagues, he resolved that they should partake
of its advantages and share its blessings. Having
resolved that it was good for Mr. Watson to be
kicked, and Dr. Renwick to be spat upon, the
grim pilgrim set out with both of the victims, and
took them to the places where the treatment could
most effectually be administered. With admi-
rable ingenuity, he contrived that no element
of the acutest suffering should be wanting.
The fullest publicity of punishment —and its most
unsparing severity. Both pilgrims lavished their
money to pay for their stripes. At the two shrines
of Illawarra and the Tumut whips and cords of
discipline were made of strings of gold; and the
brutal onlookers roared while the victims writhed.
It was in this feature that Sir Henry Parkes s
mediaeval revival was imperfect. The E.C.
institution did not preclude pity and prayer.
The Premier’s excluded both ; and exhibited the
jarring elements of popular delight and strong
language—certainly not of a religions character.
• • *
But, after all, he has done a great thing. He
has superadded to the public condemnation a
voluntary and terrible humiliation of those most
dear to him. He has carried them about and pub-
licly shown them, like Wordsworth’s “ Party in
a Parlour” in “ Peter Bell:”—
“ . . . as you by their faces see
All silent and all—damned I "
The Lesson of the Ballot Box.
New South Wales has awakened from her night-
mare. As when a troubled sleeper tutors his head,
and the terrifying vision vanishes, so has been
relaxed the grasp of the grim ogre that has been
throttling this colony. A determined voluntary
movement on our part, and, lo ! its fingers are
nerveless. The horror has vanished. Our frozen
blood once more circulates and bounds with
generous impulses. For five years narrow-
sonled bigotry and sectarian hatred have clogged
the veins and arteries of the body politic. The
streams of progress have been effectually dammed.
Class has been set against class, hate against hate,
in order that a few scurvy demagogues might hold
place and power, and rake in the loaves and fishes,
or what to them is their equivalent. The cards
have been out and shuffled by political magsmen,
and the public have been egged on by political
buttoners. And the magsmen and the buttonera
only are they who have derived benefit therefrom.
Now, we shake off our shackles.
• * •
The last Parliament was elected mainly on the
Education question. The country was unprepared
for the flood of hypocrisy and cant that over-
whelmed it. and was taken in flank by the seeming
sincerity of professors of holiness. The Education
question clearly involved the religious element,
and the moral Pecksniffs saw their chance
and took it. Sir Henry Parkes, an old
strategist, manipulated the mass before him
very skilfully. It represented the bigotry
of the community, and he chose to regard it
as a representative of the normal moral and
social condition of the country. It was a House
specially adapted to bring forth a monstrosity on
any subject involving a mock morality or a
pseudo-saintliness. Sir Henry Parkes evolved
the Licensing Act, and the House, triumphantly
shrieking with the moral spasm it had evoked
from the oommnnity, passed it with little conside-
ration. Then the eyes of the country became
opened. Freedom became a by-word. In the
name of morality, the most monstrous wrongs
were made feasible. Honest men want under,
while humbugs and hypocrites mounted the dung-
hill of temporary fame and adulation. The country
writhed with shame and remorse under the very
nose of the Government, who, blinded with pros-
perity, and inflated with arrogance, did not see
the reaction that was at work beneath them.
• • •
Parkes sat on his pinnacle, counted his faithful
“noses,” and was content. Secure with his
servile following, he heeded not the signs of the
times. Suddenly knocked off his perch by an
adverse vote, it never struck His Haughtiness
that the country was sick 'of shams, tired of
hypocrisy, and had discovered that its idol had
feet of clay. So he went to the electors with all
the presumption of a blind infatuation. His
serene dream has been rudely broken.
« * •
The elections, so far, indicate indubitably that
the country has thoroughly made up ita mind to
sweep out all the foul cobwebs of sectarian
bigotry. Dogmatic differences are done away
with. Theological squabbling is to have nothing
to do with politics. Sectarian religion—the re-
ligion that breeds hate and discord— that is the
parent of faction, and leads to murder even—is
to be banished from the Legislative arena. Pot-
feet freedom is now the “ correct card.” The
John Davieses, the G. A. Lloyds, the Hen-
sons, the Rosebys —all who traded on sectarian
organizations—have been dumped into oblivion by
the united voices of the enlightened electors. The
country won’t stand credal struggles from either
side—Roman Catholics or Protestants. It matters
not whose day it is !
# • *
Old-world quarrels have no locus standi, here.
We only want our Parliament to legislate for
New South Wales. Australia has nothing to do
with hereditary bitternesses that have set brethren
against brethren in the old country. We want no
firebrand delegate like Mr. Redmond. M.P., to
excite any latent prejudices we may have inherited.
While we sympathise, for instance, with any lawful
agitation the Irish Land League may carry on, we
don’t care to allow their grievances to provoke
disunion amongst the people of New South
Wales. The country looks to the newly elected
Parliament to throw behind it the infernal
machines of a buried bigotry, and to stand
forth as the champion of freedom and progress.
Religion has been divorced from politics in this
colony and must remain so. Any future move of
retrogression—no matter from what quarter it
comes—will be as fatally repulsed as has been the
Parkbs policy of holiness at the recent elections.
For instance, it will not be permitted, because we
now have a larger proportion of members of a
certain denomination in the Assembly than we
had before, to try and galvanise the ghost of a
discarded system of denominational education. If
the Education Act be meddled with at all, it
must bo made still more secular. The sentiment
of the people of this country is in the direction of
purely secular politics..
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Queer Tribunal.
In every sphere but one labour in this colony as well as
capital has its representation. The present Marine Board
is elected by owners of vessels alone. The sailors, whose
labour makes the ship more than an idle block of wood
or iron, are without a voice either in the election
or the management of a tribunal which too often con-
trols their destinies. We say too ofter, for it is a
notorious fact that the inembers of the Board lean
decidedly to the shipowner's side. And naturally so.
They are themselves shipowners. They are human.
What spell is upon us that every department connected
with the Treasury is a haunt of incompetency ? The
sailor who goes out of our ports is without a solitary
official friend. He has but little representation in tie
Press. Some of our leading newspapers try to fasten
on the Deity blame which should attach to the men
who own ships. When the Woniora was lost, wa
inquired whether anyone connected with the S.M.
Herald held shares in the Bulli Company, who owned
the ill-fated vessel named. The Herald, as previously
remarked, went out of its way, before any inquiry
whatever had been held, to exculpate the owners, and
to rivet all responsibility for the loss of sixteen lives on
the unoffending Almighty, who, but a few days later,
under another name (“Divine Providence”) was
saddled with the sinking of the Austral. We worship
a much-libelled Deity. “Divine Providence” is as.
countable for these disasters in precisely the fame
degree that it is answerable for M'Bhath’s Town Hall
foundations, or for the Coonaabara-hat adventures of
John Davies. The one way in which to protect the
interests of the sailor—which are identical with those
of the honest ship owner—is to have all casualties in.
vestigated by an impartially-constituted tribunal. We
desire to satisfy ourselves concerning the truth or
falsity of certain rumours which, had we not the most
implicit confidence in the honesty of the individual
members of the Marine Board, might be held to affect
their bona-jides. That is to say, the rumour in question
might be the means of placing the Board in a position
somewhat analogous to that occupied by the Hon.
James Watson as a private wharf-owner in res-
pect to his capacity as a trustee of public wharves.
Firstly, is it true that any member of the Marine
Boan:d supplies stores to shipowners ? And has he ever
supplied stores to the Woniora’s owners ? Secondly,
is not a certain member of the Marine Board inter-
ested in a couple of steam colliers? Thirdly, is any
member of the Board interested in a barque, the crew
of which were some time since sentenced to a term o£
imprisonment for refusing to leave Newcastle for N.Z.
on the pretext that the ship was overloaded and there-
fore unseaworthy? We arc informed that the said
barque shipped another crew, and her captain was,
upon arriviHg in N.Z., fined for overloading. And this
while her former crew were still in gaol here I Is nob
one of the surveyors who gave evidence before the
Board part owner of a very old steam collier ? No
man, however honest, should be placed in a position
where his private interests may possibly conflict,
whether directly or indirectly, with his* duty to tha
public. No man is a competent judge in his own
cause. No man should be asked to try either his
friends or his business rivals. The members of the Marina
Board aie all men of good repute. But, as we have
already said, they are human. And they represent a
class which has had all its own way io Sydney. The
re-constitntion of the Marine Board is one of the most
pressing tasks which await the incoming Ministry.
Whisky and Raspberry.
William Eobekt M'Cabthy, a native of Cork, Ireland,
aged 55 years, died on the 21st ultimo, at O’Leary’s
Mount Murchison Hotel, Mount Murchison. He had
been on a drinking bout, and had been starving himself.
We are delighted to find that his case wasn’t one of
lambing down. M'Cabthy had a cheque for £40, but,
though he was four whole days in the place, he only had
spent about; £16; and we have it on the indisputable
testimony of Mr. O’Leary himself that even this small
sum was spent in “ treating people." Neither was he
alcoholed to death. For we have it on the same excel-
lent authority that, as deceased appeared to be suffering
from intemperance, Mr. O'Leary “gave instructions to
the barman to give him only a.very little drink." And
the evidence of the barman, which, according to a local
paper, “ was not very material, and corroborated in the
main that of the landlord," still farther relieves our
feelings, because we find that that worthy fellow “ used
to give him a little whisky with raspberry." The fact
that the dying man's raspberry was flavoured with
whisky is cheery evidence of the kind attention paid to
his fleeting vigor. And the medical evidence completes
our joy, so far as assuring us that M'Cabthy died a
natural and inevitable death. All his vital organs were
diseased ; fhere was no food in his body ; there were
symptqms of his having been drinking heavily; and
well, “death resulted from the disease of the lungs
principally, accelerated by want of proper food, and ex-
cessive use ef stimulants. No amount of care latterly
could have saved his life, though it might have been
prolonged for a day or two." That’s all, except that
“ a verdict was returned in conformity with the medical
evidence.” Another satisfactory death is that of
Francis Murphy, who arrived at Harrison’s Hotel,
Mulga Creek, on Saturday the 11th ultimo, giving out
that he was “very bad and had been drinking n
Bourke.” Sunday morning he was missed, and his
dead body ultimately found three miles away. It is
cheering to be able to define the cause of death straight;

away, without hacking out a corpse’s inside, and in
this case such a definition was arrived at; for Mr.
W. Oliver, J.P., of Kenilworth, to whom the death
Was reported, “ did not consider a magisterial inquiry
necessary, and gave an order for the interment of the
body." Then thqre was the man known as “Joseph,”
who, while crossing the ferry at Bourke, jumped into
the water while in a delirious paroxysm. The district
coroner sat upon h ! m, and settled that he was “acci-
dentally (!) drowned while in a state of intoxication."
So that the guilt of drunken suicide will not pursue
Joseph to Purgatory. Again, we have the romantic
death out Wilcannia way, of Gborgb Jollt, who, whet
camped at Gam Well, with two jolly comrades on the
wallaby, bought a quantity of liquor from a travelling
shanty-man, and started a carouse. Jollt drank him-
self into the world-without-esd-amen, and his two
mates left him there to rot in the sun, to be pecked at
by crows and gnawed at by vultures, first having, so it
is darkly hinted, borrowed his watch and parse until
such time as he requires them again. And, touching
that, we haven’t sines heard anything of those wallaby-
trac'sers, though this jovial event also took place on
the 11th ultimo. Pass the raspberry !
The Coolie Question.
The Coolie agitation is violently fermenting in Queen-
land The Coolie “ lays over” the Chinaman as the hSU
noii r of white labour. He is filthier, he is more de-
graded, than the yellow-skinned Mongolian. Even
“ Chinese Gordon ” hasn’t a good word to offer in feeble
defence of the leprous Csolie. Besides, John China
man, at any rate, pays his own passage, and, in some
colonies, a poll-tax. The low-scale Coolie labourer, on
tho other hand, is lured here under specious promisee
by speculative agents and miserly planters. They want
to place him on a level with the healthy-veined island
kanaka, whose blood is not fevered and debauched
with the hereditary distillations of centuries of Oriental
vice. And they actually pay him—barring clothes—
better wa?es than the kanaka. Yet, at the same time,
they make a veritable slave of him. The Coolies
brought by the Devonshire were forwarded by a Mr.
Caufiei.d, who contracted with each man, either for
two and a-half or five years, at ‘‘£20 sterling per
annum, and house and garden 2-12 square yards
per adult free ; no food, no clothing.” These
coolies are bound to renew the contract made with Mr.
Cahfielo upon arrival in Queensland, ‘‘with whomso-
ever Mr. Caitfiki.d’s agents see fit.” They were
promised Is. x )er day while waiting shipment is
Colombo, but this part of the agreement, according to
an intelligent Bengalee named Shamkow, has not been
carried out. Ostensibly, the coolies are to be employed
as labourers on “sugar, coffee, cinchona, or cocoa”
plantations. But many of them are skilled carpenters
and cabinet-makers, and it is natural that their masters
will get all they can out of them. Fancy a European
working for 7s 8d. a week, and finding his own clothes,
even with the aid of “ 212 square yards of house and
garden free!” Naturally, white men in Queensland
are incensed at this influx of .labour pestilence
The Coolies, too, swear they have been kidnapped from
Ceylon, and broken faith with. At BundUberg they were
accommodated in the Immigration Barracks, and, if we
are to believe the Bundaberg Star, this spot “more
resembled the hiring-place or slave-market of a Southern
Slave State, before the war of abolition, than a ruing
town in a British colony, settled by free-born whites
and governed by popular institutions.” The recalci-
trant Coolies were sent promptly off to prison. The scene
in court was unique, and has been described thus:—
‘'Near to the prisoners' box stand tho seven Cingalese
in a row, silent witnesses of all that is going on. On
the Bench are those who are trying the case, seven
magistrates, the central figure beiug Mr. A. P. Barton.
On the left of these* sits Mr. F. L. Norr, the
speculator in this great labour scheme, whip
in hand, and wearing a cross-belt a U ■ miliUire,
attached to which is a havresack, and in which it is
rumoured a revolver is concealed." The planters who
secured coolies have boycotted the Bandaberg Star,
and have even informed storekeepers that, if they
advertise in that paper, their stores would no longer be
patronised A hotel keeper is to be prosecuted for
harboring Cingalese. One coolie, when sentenced to
one month for desertion, said he would cut his throat
sooner than go to work. So the infliction blisters all
rouad. Although thus treated as slaves, what is the
political status of these Coolies? The Cingalese,
Malt.se, and time-expired Coolies of Mauritius and
Natal are all British subjeets. Consequently, after a
six months’ residence, they are entitled to a vote for
the ‘Legislature of Queensland. By and bye, a p anter,
with a couple of hundred six months’ men, will be a
man before whom a candidate for Parliament will
grovel, and whom a Minister will delight to honor.
Churchmen and Churchmen
The position of the Church of England in Sydney at
the present time would be absurd if it were not
humiliating. First, we have the manner of appoint-
ment of the new Bishop made a party question as
between the Highs and Lows. The High Churchmen
distrusted a committee of the whole Synod because
there they were outnumbered; the Low Churchmen
distrusted a committee of Bishops lest the Bishops
should appoint a High Churchman. So the Dean of
Sydney forced the appointment of the committee of the
whole Synod, and the result was such that the com-
mittee sat with closed doors lest the public should know
how the members discussed their to-be Father in God,
as graziers discuss prize sheep; pedigree, such and
such ; training, such and such; prizes, such and such.
And, after all the rigmarole was gone through, an
English suffragan bishop refused the tempting offer.
Possibly Dr. Papet had heard of Dr. Barrt 1 Seeing
all this bother for nothing, an outsider is temprid to
exclaim: “In the name of common sense, why not do
without a Bishop; or else ask Lord Loptus for a conge
d Hire ? But the Government of the Church of Eng-
land in this colony, during the late Dr. Barker’s
absence, and the interregnum since his death, has been
of such a character as has already brought itself into
contempt, and the Church of Epglard into a position
such that any homogeneous “Little Bethel” has more
practical influence ;The government of Dean Cowpee,
as exemplified in the silencing of Dr. Ellis, the rcfnsaj
of Mr. Kbmmis's canonry, the attempted foisting of an
extremely Low Churchman upon the icluctant church
at N rth is mors suicidal than patriarchal. It'
is the obstinacy of a weak and narrow-minded man,
albeit eincore; far, indeed, removed from trie strength
of a strong, far-seeing, tolerant man. Bishop Moob-
HtwsE manages his church well without setting his
clergy and people by the ears ; he does not insult and
degrade his High Churchmen, and devise dissenting
fads such as open air preaching, etc, with his Low
Churchmen. But, alas for us, between aCowPB* and a
Mookbo0«i there is » great gulf fix d.

any claim or demand in respect of any matter or thing
aot provided for in the said regulations; and that the
acceptance by the Surveyor-General, Deputy-Surveyor-

General for that purpose, of any work done by me as

which they hail.
A week or two ago a man up in Brisbane was fined five
pounds for blackening his wife s eyes, knocking her
down, and then kicking her till she became insensible.
Now, we consider this a hard case. A man marries a
loving, trusting, tender woman. She sacrifices herself i
with all her hopes to him, and places her future eon-
fldcntly in his hands. Very well. Bat he gets tired j
of her after a time. The charms that won his heart
when he first knew her have lost their power to please '
or, haply, she his lost them by slaving in his service.
What is a man to do under such circumstances ? Why,
kick her till she is nearly dead, of course. It would
be better to Vick her to death outright, only that an
antique and tyrannous law will hang him if he does.
And even when he only kicks her into insensibility, ■
like the Brisbane man, he is actually fined nearly as
much for it as if he had maltreated a horse I Wo tl ink
this is shameful. If a poor man wants to kick his
wife, he has to save up for a month to get the money to
pay the damages. This is always the way. Luxuries
are always for the rich. Such few pleasures as life
affords to the son of toil are invariably made prohibi-
tory. What a glorious thing it must be to be a rich
man, and be able to kick your wife every day and pay
for it 1

THE GREAT
ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
T H « recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
-*• a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as hia opinion.
•* I have found St, JACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
oure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought o« by ovor-ex.
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating tbo complaint without further trouble."
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what ho was talking about; and now he s-ayg
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

Lord Charles Sootfc is on his way to Melbourne
to marry the daughter of a well known stock-agent,
who is related to Lady Clarke. The wedding takes
place in January.
Mr. John Harris has again been re-elected
Mayor of Sydney The conferment on Mr. Harris of a
third term of office is designed not only as a compli-
ment to the gentleman who is now very much Mayor,
hut as a very left-handed compliment to a person now
v jry much out of the Council.
It’s altogether untrue, it appears, that the en-
gagement between Lord Dapolin and the daughter of
the newly-created Victorian baronet. Sir W. J. Clarke,
has been broken off,—for the very sufficient reason that
n «> snch engagement, was ever entered into. And this
reminds us that one of the Hon. Ivn Bligh’s team, who
has three initials to bis name, made a big hit—for six
figures— during tho voyage of the Peshawar.
°That accomplished surgeon, Dr. Tarrant, the
member for Kiams. some time ago removed a tumour
from a certain E.C. prelate’s head. Of course John
Davias wouldn’t be so mean as to raise the religious
war-cry on the foregoing fact, but it is a fact that tbe
wnr.ory was raised on that fact, by not a few of John’s
followers. '‘Would yon vote for a man who’d cure a
Papist bishop instead of cutting his throat ?”
Isaac Singer, the patentee of the “ Singer ”
sewing machine, died worth £80,000 a year But the
r>al inventor of the sowing machine was a “ ohnm” of
Singer’s named! Elias Howe. He was a genius, and,
Pke nearly all such, was a dreamy careless creature.
He died nrserably poor, while Singer, who “used”
him, could give his daughter a marriage portion of
neirlv half a million, and died himself a millionaire.
The “ King of Torquay,” as he was styled, commenced
life as a “ loblolly boy ” on a barge. «nd was almost
eve-ytbing by turns till he met the unhappy gifted Elias
Howe.
This is how the late Dr. Tait got married. He
was just in the height of his first fame against the
Traotaripn movement. The beautiful daughter of
Arohdoaeon Spooner was an ardent Tractarian and High
fihnrchwoman. She was dying to meet “ that atrocious
T*'t and confound him ” She met him. They argued,
and they got married. But the world never heard
whether the argument continued after marriage, and
who got the best of it. We, who am a married man,
can guess.
Upon the same morning that the cable flashed
the news of the death of James Lilly white, the
cricketer, a Melbourne man opened a letter from him,
which said, infer alia: ‘‘No doubt you saw about the
scandal in your papers, but it is all quiet now. Such
reports, even if nothing in them, do harm to cricket
and ericketers generally; but it will be a warning for
men to act strictly on the square for the future, and
not give a loophole for suspicion. ... I wonder
-vhero I shall next see you ! In England or Melbourne ?”

The Hon. Francis Ormond, who has given tho
pries of two or three baronetcies to Victorian public
and religious institutions, is now on n visit to Sydney.
i°o is Hon. James Balfour, who bosses the Victorian
V M C. Aand is ene of tho holiest of Victorian politi-
cians Poor Aspinall, in the Assembly one evening,
alluded to Mr. Balfour as ‘'the bon. and reverend
member.” Mr. Balfour at onoe got on to his hind legs
and flattened hack his ears. He requested tho Speaker
to ask Mr. Aspinall for an apology. ‘‘Ah, well." con-
tinued the wit, “ I suppose I was wrong, and I’ll with-
draw. Let’s say the honourable and irreverent mem-
bet, then "
When Kereopa (the Maori gentleman who
slaughtered the Eev. Mr. Volkner and swallowed his
eves) was under sentence of death, an improved gallows
was invented by the Sheriff. Kereopa somehow or other
heard of the fact, expressed himself as deeply interested
in the invention, and so plagued the officials by his
repeated requests for a view of the instrument of death
that they at last allowed him to see it tried. Long
pandbiva wore used on the occasion instead of men, and
when Kereopa paw the bags fall through the trap he
absolutely yelled with delight. A few days afterwards
r man was used instead of a sandbag. That man was
Kereopa.
The last Mayoral election of Adelaide was a
farce. Two reputed skinflints, Fuller and Bnik. were
the candidates The late Mayor. Mr. E. T. Smith, a
wealthy brewer and owner of ever so many pubs., bled
so copiously and so smilingly whenever appealed to,
that no one wanted to be his successor. The place was
too hot, and meant ever so much money given away
during the year. However, Fuller and Buik put up.
Neither of them canvassed for a single vote! The
election was the tamest erer seen in Adelaide, and
Fuller is now sorry be beat Buik. He lately sold out of
the great coaching firm of Hill and Co at a good figure,
being shrewd enough to see that railways were cutting
under. But even his proverbial canniness can’t keep
him from pouring out money after E. T. Smith’s two
years* magnificence.
The children of Israel mourn and are not to be
comforted. He not very long ago arrived from England
and proved to the satisfaction of tbe shixty per phent
fraternity that on attaining his majority he would be
entitled to a respectable fortune—sav £30,000. He must
have proved it pretty deirlr, von will tay. Well, they
understood he intended settling here and so allowed
him to anticipate his patrimony to tho extent of £3,000
nr so, for which they charged him all sorts of things.
He’s had a good time here, and is now obliged to leave
this colony—called home suddenly on urgent business.
He is still a minor, and as they have all along dealt
with him as snob, they can’t do either the ca. sa or the
ne exeat regno trick. So he says. “ Bless you, my child-
ren,” and they are not to be comforted.
A certain Victorian racing man—let ns call
him Brown —the other day presented a jockey who had
■won him a lot. of money, with a cheque for £200. But
all Browns aren’t alike We once heard of a Brown—
ho’s dead now—who had a shepherd on his run for
twenty-seven years, and who let the major part of his
wages run during that time. At last, “the beggar
died," and Brown had him buried. An ancient sister
pst in an appearance some months after, and produced
a letter from her dead brother, telling her to apply to
his master for his wages whenever she heard of his
death. She was politely informed that the funeral
cost more than the sum duo (twonty-seven years* ser-
vice) ; and but for the charity of the townspeople, she
would have had to walk 200 miles back to where she
came from.
As we’re all interested in James Hennessy and
Co.’s cognac, this item should please everybody. Tbe
last Paris scandal is the flight of Mrs. Richard
Hennessy, the wife of tbe senior partner in the great
Cognac firm, with a horaebreaker named Earle As she
has a fortune of about ten thousand a year, the horse-
breaker doubtless thisks that he has done as good a
stroke of business as the footman who ran away with
Mrs Young rome years ago; but Mrs. Hennessy cannot
be divorced, and cannot therefore marry him The
position of the children by her marriage with Mr.
Hennessy is all the more pitiable, because the husband,
who is in a great measure responsible for the unhappy
occurrence, has for some time bsen the cavalier servant
of tbe Hon. Mrs. , and has abandoned his home
for her sake.
Harold Stephen is now running a thrilling tale
in the Campbelltown Herald, entitled “ Saved by a
Ring;” and, although it has only reached the filth
chapter, he has already managed to get his hero into an
awful scrape. It seems this gentleman has a wife, and
his wife had a rich aunt, and so—but let him tell the
yarn himself:— ** One day the old lady fell ill, and I had
no difficulty in recognising her disorder, which was a
species of typhoid fever, just then prevalent in the
quarter in which we lived I saw no necessity for call-
ing in a doctor. and physicked her myself; giving her
the ordinary doses from the Pharmacopeia." After
Harold’s hero’s •• physicking," we need scarcely state
that the old duchess died, and now the amateur doctor
occupies tbe first floor of a condemned cell. When he’d
do that to his wife’s aunt, what in thunder wouldn’t he
do to his wife’s mother ?
It is rumoured that the next Governor of Vic-
toria will be Col. Sir Andrew Clarke, of tho Royal
Engineers, who at present occupies the responsible
Saat of Inspector-Gsneral of Fortifications in Great
ritain (thanks io his friend, Mr. Childers, Minister of
War), and who previously acted as Inspector of Public
Works in India and Governor of the Straits Settlement.
Sir Andrew, then Captain, Clarke was the first Sur.
veyor-General of Victors, and was the author of the
existing Municipal Act. He is a son of Major
Andrew Clarke, who died, when Governor of Western
Australia, at Perth in 1846, and is a first cousin of the
late Marcus Clarke, of whose literary abilities »’
thought so highly that he brought tho author’s brilliant
novel of “ His Natural Life,” under the attention of
the Prince of Wales when he visited India. The
Prince became so deeply interested in the convict tale
that he sat up the principal portion of a night to read
it through. And yet poor Marcus only got £100 for the
book. So much for the intellectual sense ot this com-
mnnity.
This is how it was done. When Parkes invited
the heads of tho Civil Sarvice to meet him and get
“marmalade” on the memorable morning of the East
Sydney nomination, ho had a Herald reporter waiting
in the next room. In order that the reporter should
not (“officially,” at any rate) be aware that the civil
servants had come in accordance with an invitation
from the Premier, and not as a deputation properly so
called, the Dictator did not bring the reporter on to the
scene until preliminaries had been gone through and he
had told them the anonrmous letter yarn. When the
reporter did arrive—and Parkes, with charming naiveti,
so arranged matters as to make it appear that his being
called in at all was a result of his purely accidental
presence—one of the Civil servants was ’cute enough to
see the little game, and made certain observations
which let the reporter into the secret. Otherwise, it
would have appeared from the Bbrald report that the
civil servants were, in the strictest sense of the term,
a deputation. For all that the Herald man was
mesmerised.
Here’s the latest about the mad King of Bavaria.
He dines alone, with plates set for imaginary guests.
At all hours of tbe night he routs up his courtiers to
play at billiards with him, and if they have a button
away he dismisses them from bis service. He orders
plays and operas to be performed at midnight, at which
he is the sole spectator. Sometimes on these occasions
he falls asleep, then the performers have to make a
pause until he awakes. These interludes not infre-
quently last two or three hours. Occasionally he takes
an aotor or actress into his favour, but, in this case, no
infringement of etiquette is permitted. A little while
ago, he insisted upon the ohief actress ot the theatre
reading tragedies to him when he was in bed. One
night, being tired—for she had to stand—she sat down
on the edge of the bed. She was at onoe banished from
tbe kingdom for having insulted Majestv by touching
the Royal couch. He has already built one palace,
which architects, decorators, and masons are under
oath not to describe; and his latest freak is to build
another on the model of Lonis XIV.’s folly at Ver-
sallies, every room being reproduced according to
exact measurement.
On Sunday week, a hearae followed by two
mourning coaches conveyed to her last resting place, at
the Randwick Cemetery, Eliza Winstanley. Her
father was scene painter at the first Theatre Royal in
Sydney (which then stood on the site now occupied by
the Roval Hotel in George-street), when, about the
year 1835, she made her first appearance on any stage
in the character of Clari, the Maid of Milan. She was
the first colonial actress who left this colony to practise
her profession in England, where she secured a lucra-
tive engagement with the late Mr. Charles Kean, in
whose company she continued for several years, and
established herself as a great favourite in London.
She also played with the late Mr. Macready in the
United States, and at Drury Lane under tbe manage-
ment of Mr. James Henderson. Hor performances of
such characters as Widow Warren, Widow Green,
Mrs. Malaprop, &o., were described as the best in that
line for many years. Daring her lon$ residence in
London, and while on the stage, she was regularly
engaged to perform before the Queen and Royal Family
at the Windsor Castle Christmas entertainments.
About twelve years ago, she was, on account of bodily
infirmities, compelled to quit the stage, and since that
time has been a constant contributor to the London
periodicals—Bow Bells, Reynolds’ Miscellany, &c.
Now that Parkes has been knocked kite-high
and had his teeth clipped, there’s no harm in telling
the following characteristic little story, which is
bnt a fair sample of ten thousand others. A year or
so ago, on an off-day, word was sent to tho Herald
office that a couple of deputations were about to inter-
view the Colonial Secretary, who invited the atten-
dance of a reporter. The gentleman deputed by the
head of the staff was the elegant, genial and popular
—, how we do gild the lily, but no matter—“Prince
of Wales," who duly sailed into the Hemperor’s
reception room, took notes of the first deputation's
yabber, and then sat down to await the entrance of the
second deputation, who, however, were not shown in at
once. “ Shall I show in the other denutation F ”
enquired the messenger of Sirenree. “When I have
finished writing I will order you to show them in,"
loftily replied the Dictator, scratching away the while
with his magnnm bonum. It suddenly occurred to the
Prince of Wales that His Imperial (Majesty might wish
to be alone, so he said: “Shall I wait here. Sir Henry,
or come in again with the second denotation ? ”
Parkes made no answer. The Prince of Wales there-
upon repeated his query, when the great man raised
his nose from the paper and replied majestically: “ It
is a matter of tho most perfect indifference to me."
“ That being the case," retorted the newspaper-man,
“ I shall stay." And Thomas did stay.
Sir William Robinson, who has just been ap-
pointed Governor of South Australia, is, both in
appearance and general characteristics, somewhat
diverse from his brother. Sir Hercules. He is tall and
slight, with an intellectual oast of countenance, and is
by no means an enthusiast in sporting matters. He is,
if anything, rather of a retiring and conservative
temperament, and when he says “ yea ” or “ nay," he
means it. In fact, under a placid exterior, and ap-
patently nervous manner, he bides great force of
character. When he was first installed as Governor of
West Australia, the Honourable (now Sir) F. P. Barlee
was Colonial Secretary, and the leader of a strong
agitation having for its object the introduction of
Responsible Government to that colony. The astute
Barlee. like our own Parkes, was accustomed to
twist Governors, especially elderly Governors, round
his fingers as he pleased. In Sir William Robin-
son, who strongly opposed the agitation for
responsible rule, he met his match, and Barlee,
discomfited, retired to England, from whence he was
appointed to the minor Governorship of Honduras.
Sir William is said to have strong Protestant proclivi-
tiee, and is, moreover, as far as his Imperial connection
is concerned, a thorough red-tape ruler. He is a man
who says little, and thinks much. Thus cautious, ho
seldom gets into trouble, and bids fair to rise rapidly
as an Imperial official. Though not gushingly popular
at tho first flush, he la a chief who wears well, land
alwaiys commands respect. He has a genius for music,
and takes a strong interest in all appertaining to it.

One evening recently some North Shore larrikins
visited Manly, ostensibly to hear an election speech.
The Manly larrikins had heard they were
coming, and actually paraded the fact that
they had out their hair in anticipation of the
fray. There was one little set-to on the pier, but
neither party seemed anxious for action until the
North Shore contingent had re-embarked. Then the
two mobs howled and cursed at each other like fiends.
The parting scene would have been hideously tragic
had it not been so awfully funny. The larrikins in the
boat took off their coats and invited the Manly larri-
kins to step on board; while the latter were Squally
loud in their entreaties that the North Shore men
should jump on the pier “and have their livers cat
ont." Bat there wasn’t a drop of gore spilt after all. *
His Muse.
It was an aged stranger man.
Whose feeble steps did say.
As plain as words, that he had walked
A long and weary way.
He stopped before that office whose
Dread scribes men’s blood congeal;
A man sto d outside at the time
A-chewmg orange peel.
The stranger spoke—the man replied,
“ Sir, I’m ” (this isn’t square).
He thought he’d got a flesh and blood
Subscriber unaware.
And asked the stranger for his name,
Also for his address.
Adding the Weekly Shroud was a
Most wonderful success 1
Whereat the stranger softly smiled,
And said “ Of course; a wise
Provision that, to make it suit
Cold ham or eke hot pies.
** But I have eome a weary way.
And killed a dozen nags.
To gaze upon the master-mind
Who writes * Upon the Flags.’ ’’
The orange-peel man handed him
To a reporter, then.
Who straightway introduced him to
The Babelasian den.
A being with a touzled head
Looked up and fiercely frowned:
“ Stranger, take off your boots,” he said,
“ For this is holy ground."
Tho stranger looked at his boots, Chen
At those the genius wore;
Then muttered softly in his beard,
“ I have been there before."
•‘ Groat sage,” said he, “ where is the Mnse,
The inspiration where.
By which yon write those pars, that flash
Like bayonets in a square ?
Is it Champagne, or Absinthe strong,
Or the Almighty Ram ?”
“No. stranger," was the sad reply,
“ I do it all on gum."
The stranger, when he wont outside.
Had a contented eye :
“ I’ve seen him," was his sole remark,
“ And now I want to die."

MERYLA is but 11 miles from the Hill View Estate
lately purchased as a
Permanent Country Vice-Regal Residence,
The soil is magnificent, being of wbinstone or trap
formation, and is equal to any iu the District, and the
land is of that pleasing unduiatory character for which
this healthy and papular locality is noted.
Speculators would do well in obtaining some of the
Village Hites for future Business Purposes, as from its
position, its aeoeesibillty by rail, its proximity to the
Vice-Regal Residence, MERYLA win, ere long, bo a
place of no small importance.
The Railway Department have decided to put up a
Waiting-Room and Platform on the Ground. Tne wort
being how in progress, this will cause a constant stream
of traffic from button Forest and District# and it is
not unlikely that MERYLA will be made the Vice-Regal
Station,
Business Menwhoie avocations are of that exhaustive
nature as to necessitate frequent changes to a lighter,
freer atmosphere, away from the tlfdcts of the sea air,
will find MURYLA. the beat position in which to secure
VILLA HIXEH. It has all the advantages of access
and pure air of BOWRAL, BURRADOO, and MuSS
V ALE, yet from its present obscurity it is obtainable
at a muon lower figure.
To those whose health has been shattered by various
causes, or who suffer from pulmonary complaints.
MURAL A is an asylum where they are bound to im-
prove. The light dry air of tois locality cannot fail to
be beneficial. Lat them secure a Homestead Block and
reside at MERYLA Tie gain in health and strength
will more than compensate for ihe outlay.
To Thrifty Men of small means, or Emigrants who
are on the look out for a place of settlement, MEEVLa.
offers great advantages. Secure a small farm. The
soil is of such a character that it will produce an
abundant harvest with the smallest possible amount of
labour.
Five Acres of Land at MERYLA, judiciously planted
with Emit Tree", will give a sufficiency lor the com-
fortable support of a man and his family.
The Land will be sold on the Ground,

For a nice, easy-going, sociable crowd commend
ns to the musical world of Bayreuth. For example—
Hans von Bulow, th» phenomenal piasist, has jost
married a celebrated German actress Ho ia one of the
principal patnns of Wagner’s theatre, and, in company
with the great composer, Abtd Liszt, frequently plays
for the " mnsio-of-tho- far-future" in vent or gratuitously,
Bow, here’s where the laugh conus in. Bulow’a first
wifa was a daughter of Liszt's. After a nice round
family hed been raised, Hans got a divorce from his
wife, and Wagner not cn’y prompily married ter, but
t»ok the fchole ot ths family off Bulow's "ban’s" as
Wfll. Th s seems a littls bit mixed to us, but the
whole crowd live on the best of terms, and when Mrs.
Bulow No. 2 sends over to Mrs. Wagner No. 1 for a
loan of her wash-tn'< it is immediately handed over
with the most cheerful goodwill imaginable In like
manner, when ths former Mrs ftulow wishes to borrow
a basin of flour or a flat-ircn, Mrs Bulow the fcoondat
once returns the compliment. Little children—let us
love one another —as they do in “ Yarmany."

From our Adelaide correspondent :—Herbert
Flemming had abeneflt lately. He deserved it for more
than the usual reasons. For one thing he has developed
into u first-class stage manager, and for another he has
a jr-frrenoe f ar going about with a clean face. When
he took charge of the stage here—and to say truth for
just a little while after—tho house was like—let me
get hold of a strong simile—was like a lunatio asylum
in Hell, with the shouting of soene-shifters and the
howling and hammering of carpenters. Only deaf men
and blind men went o the thearra during this period.
The deaf men used to come awav remarking that it
was a very quiet and enjoyable performance; the blind
men used to go heme saying that ihey had never been
in such a nice dockyard before. But it is to hs regretted
that Mr. Flemming, with his pofsonal beauty and pro-
fessional experience, docs not make any advance in
his art. His acting ot four years ago was entitled tons
much consideration as his acting to day. However, the
benefit was a big saccess, as Mr. Flemming bag many
friends in this city. Ths piece played was •• Tho
Marble H» art." Mr. Emmett as Diogenes and Ferdi-
nand Volage made a great hit. Just here ons might
ask the profession a question ? Da actors er actresses
ever consider it necessary to cultivate their minds
beyond the mere learning of the particular parts they
have to play ? Do they knowi nythingof the literature
of the present or ‘.he past? Have they read and
appreciated Cicero’s ‘‘Do Senoctute?" (Bi'ly Wilson
s'eisps with it under his pillow—Critic Bulletin) If
they have not they cannot blame the public forgiving
them the cold shoulder, nor the yressfor damning them
with faint praise. Whuffi reminds m« that J. W. Dodga
had a benefit on the 5th; Wyhert Eseve has also had
one And finally, Allison is back, and Q-attan Biggs is
coming. Can you wonder that we weep ?
* * * *
The drama's looking up. Leake drew in Tam-
worth in four nights AS 14s.: so says the local George
Washington. It is satisfactory to learn that real tragic
talent is appreciated in the country now-a-days. We
didn’t think it was, before wo saw this item. And we
didn’t think, either, that “’Art’s ’Appy’Ours" were
at 'xownsville. Nor that Benhamo’s Circus was there
also, giving a ben. to the auti-Coolie league.

Melbourne is a bit mournful in the matter of
plays. “Tho Lights o’ Lo idon" still run at the
Theatre Koyal, and “The King’s Dragoons,” at the
Opera House. Mr. Polk has D*>eu playing “The
American ’’ at tho Princess. The old, old farce “ Lend
me Five Shillings," followed the comedy. A Mel-
bourne critic, speaking of one ot the actors in, it says:
“Mr. Musgrave, as Captain 1 hobbs, was remarkable for
bis costume. To himself, probably, hi. represented an
officer in undress; but to an imp rtial spectator he
looked much more like a market inspector or a town
hall caterer." We are sadly afraid this critic is not of
a serious turn of mind Ho would never do for the
Shroud, “ 1'he Old Love and tho New" has succeeded
" The American,'’ which fetches us gently round to the
statement that the Montague 'Turner Company are row
playing at tho Bijou. The Ba f olelaer Minstrels are
doing pretty fair easiness at the Victoria Hall. And
the Marshall and Ireland Company, the Juno Dramatic
Company and the Marian Willis Company are perform
iug at various places in the interior of Victoria.

Dixon, the tenor singer of the late Clark and
Bymau crowd, is going to Melbourne with a company
organised by H. L. Kirkman. This company will con-
sist of a let of people whose names we forget, and they
will play a very sunny burlesque, the title ot which we
don’t remembt-t, But we are very glad about some-
thing, somehow.
ft ft ft ft
Datchey’s Academy of Music is dark as the
grave just now. The "Bed Stocking*" are showing
their distracting ankles in home far off spot, the nam*
of which we cau’t think of at present. And, by the
way, before wa forget it, several persona have been ask-
ing us where this company has gens to. We take this
opportunity of informing them we don’t know and
don’t oare an imprecation. Dutohy is with us anyhow,
and we are not wholly unhappy. But the Aoademy
looks very mournful. The front is no longer a blaze of

Emdie is enchanting in this opera. We don’t
think we have ever seen her in any part in which she
was so comple’ely fascinating as she is in “Perichole.”
She seems to become more brilliant, and to increase in
piquancy every time we see her. Wo think she will never
die._ Bub she has none of the monotony of people who
den t dio about her Time cannot change, nor custom
stale her infinite variety. We are indebted for this
felicitous phrase to a man who nsed to wear a large bald
forehead, and a cardboaid turndown collar about two
feet deep We print this remark of his with all the
more pleasure because he has not said anything for a
long time back. He is now phosphate of limo and a lot
of other things. A'l the rest of t he performers play their
parts well. Wa think no Christian ought to die without
seeing this opera. This is ’’ one ” for the clergy.

Mr. H. R. Harwood is to have a “ ben,” on
Monday next-, which wiM be the last night but one of
“ The Mascoce” at the T.B, A lot of people are glad
to hear that Mr. Harwood is to have a bespeak. Wo tre
glad too: —indeed next to having a benefit ourselves we
know of nothing that affords us more pleasure than to
learn that Laurent is to receive a complimentary at the
hands of the management. We shall go, of course, if
only to hear the now immortal “aitarella—wa moan
Sar?aparilla—or rather Saltcellar Troupe announced as
the Salts and-Senua Troupe, and a lot of ether mad
gags of a similarly outrageous nature. Opinions, of
course, may differ as to whether Mr. Harwood overdoes
the local business or not, but there can be no question
as to bis skill as an artiste, and as to his capacity for
interpreting the humorous phases of hisart. We should
think H. R will have a good house. After the 11 Mas.

and then Aladdin, eto.

Mr Sheridan’s season at the Gaiety will soon be
over. We wou'd be sorry forties, only that we are glad.
We are glad that we are not sorry. Our feelings are
mixed. We have a tear in one eye for Mr. Sheridan’s
depar ure, while we wink with the other at Trank
Towers’ latest and loveliest pantomime peri. But, we
forgjt—we never wink. It is considered giddy in polite
society for any but clergymen to do so now. We are
losing a good actor, aud good actors don t stand at every
corner in this city. They may he plentiful enough, but,
as the Spanish proverb says of good women, they are
dead. Mr Sheridan has gone pretty nearly through bis
reperto.ro Ho playsd “Louis XI " yesterday evening
(Wednesday), aud plays it again to-night. We didn't I
go to see him last night, because wo were moving to a
new boardisg-house at the lime. We always leave the
old one at dust. But we believe he is very fair as L.uis.
“ Lear” is his best character, ns far asjwe have seen yet
He played this on Saturday night, and on the first nights
of this week. We have seen him in Le*r before, but
so have wo seen lightning aud heard thunder. Yet
neither of these grows monotonous by repetition
There is an /Esohylean sublimity about tho character
of the mad old k in* that makes us listen to his slightest
speech with a hush of supernatural awe. There is a
metaphysical reason for this that wo have not time to
explain here just now. Anyhow, he who has suffered
most is regarded as having got nearer to the secret of
things, and as having the first claim to speak. It is
ont of the depths, not from the beithts, that the voice
comes which shakes the soul of man. Mr. Sheridan is
an intellectual man, and understands this His Lear
is a grand fi ture—mightily -moulded as the Phidian
Jove, yet perfect as a cameo. Everything he says or
does has a purpose. He has always the terrible denoue-
ment in view. The minds of the audience are caught up
and whirled about like straws on the whirlwind of his
passion. In the night scene, where he is out on the
heath exposed to the fury of the storm, his acting is
especially fine. This is the very Lear who “ tears his
sea ike soul up by the roots and lashes it in scorn
against the skies.”

Miss Davenport made a sweet Cordelia. We can’t
ray anything more about her just now, because we are
going out w,th a spade this afternoon to dig for the
mole who writes the dramatic criticisms for the Rum,
an i we haven’t any time to spare. In the Monday issue
of that sparkling jonrral, this brilliant burrower states
that “ Miss Louise Pomeroy, as Cordelia, made the
most of hor comparatively small pare, and aottd with
charming tenderness throughout ;’* and, further down,
“Miss Enina Bronton and Miss Nellie Playfair, as
Goneril and Cordelia, dressed and acted effectively ”
We were under the impression that the Pomeroy was
iu India. But, then, of course, we don’t know what
the dead know And, as far as dramatic criticism is
concerned, one can do it ever so much be ter iu a tomb.
It then acquires a certain tone of shanel.house cheer-
fulness which stamps it as genuine Bum or Shroud
litaratnre at once.

We think we liked the other performers very
much—Buckley in particular. We dou’t remember what
he played, but it was something in black. The genial
brogue of this promising actor is very touching and
impressive But we likec him better as the fireman in
Kichard HI. There his performance was marked by
qmet dignity throughout. He never opened his month
all the iima, except once when he yelied “ Hooray tor
Richmond, ’ or something else. Edmund is net the part
for Mr. Cates. Mr. Cates should always be the good boy
of tho play, who wears smooth hair aud looks pretty

The Elections
"^, H 1 E results of the past week have been in com-
plete harmony with those# the opening days of
the campaign. I he anatomies of political hum-
bags he in almost every field, and the “Strong”
Government has sustained, in the person of some
of its most influential members, renewed defeats.
JJr. lien wick is back from Tumut, and his pro-
gramme for some time to come is likely to bo “ Is
there anybody ill?” Mr. James Watson has been
the catspaw of Sir Henry at Wollongong; and
he has not added to his reputation either as a
solid sensible man or ’cute politician. From
Kiama. John Davies is back on his big pink ear.
with his barbed political tail between his leg*.
1 his contest was the most despicable of the lot
and the country has special reasons to be satisfied
over the result. Kiama is full of foreigners.
Ihey come from round about the slums of Derry
and the crags and bogs of Tipperary. Fifteen
years ago Parkas fanned the flame of Old World
hate on this spot, and on every occasion he or his
nominees have endeavoured to keep alive these
foreign recollections, so that the people might
always be ready to grab at one another's throats.
The children in any number of houses are reared
as if m the fcetid atmosphere of Irish oppression
and cut-throat reaction. Rejected for the trying
of this kind of work in Sydney, Parkes, after
stoutly denying the first rumour of his intended
visit crept down to Kiama to aid Davies, who.
for his factional and other tricks had just boon
ignommiously kicked out of South Sydney, the
locate or his pnnc pal underground workings.
m . lni8^ eria l visit to Kiama meant faction.
While in the heat of the contest in South Sydney
Davies, rejected by the Orangemen, was roadv to
kies the big too of the Pope, in the perTon of
Paddy Larkin ; he crawled like a sycophant at the
bumoned feet of King Billy at Kiama. The
people wouldn’t have the man that no other con-
stituency in the country would touch. The
sensible residents of that beautiful little town-
ship outvoted the foreigners, who now go baek to
their dons to clack in their gibberish, and gnash
with their moss-grown curly neeth. Any alien who
now speaks about politics with ten centuries of
brogue is strung up for the crows. But the crows
are sensible. And Davies is back, thoroughly well
thrashed, all his trioka exposed, his underground
works flooded, and his great hat bulged in It
is a question which has been dragged in the
dirtier gutter—Parkes or Davies. The Canter-
bury election resulted in the death of Nelson—we
m f, an of Henson,—another of Parkes’s holy
pillars. Then Roseby is as dead as his own tomb-
stones—the Shoalhaven people having elected a
white man in Mr. Humphery, Roseby will
now have more time to spend at muffin struggles
and bun sacrifices. Again, Henry Harry Cooke,
the personification of abject political serfdom
has met hu fata at Forbes, and Sir Henry will
r aV .° t 2,, find 8om0 othw “nose” to grasp and
o remaUi8 of Kidd are to be found near
the Camden hustings, and as far as politics are
concerned, ha had better see Roseby early for a
tombstone. Roseby has lots of designs for his
friends. Andy Lynch is in for Caujoar—the
greatest old log-roller in the country. This will
be his last Parliament; the local donkey will be
nominated against him next time. G. A. Lloyd—
Parkea’a girl," aa he is humorously called, —
doean t represent Newcastle any letger. Heifers.
Dibba and Holtermann defeated the Parkes noma-
nee at ot. Leonard's easily. The best scuttle tha&
as taken place since contests was
run for Illawarra. The news that Sir Herr/
r*arkes had gone to Wollongong to assist h3r,
Watson, and that his corps of canvassers in-
eluded HngheyTaylar of Parramatta, the Hon.
John Stewart, M.L.C. (or Bilious Stewart, as ho
is better known), and other notabilities, appeared
in the Evening Alfked of Friday. Two hours
later, The Bulletin was on the war-path. At
11 p.m. our Eepresentative (Printer, a big B,
please) was aboard ship with 2000 cartoons foe
Wollongong and 1500 for Kiama. Daylight on
Saturday morning found the town pretty well em-
elhsned wdh a grand display of the satirical and
he scorching: and just to show that there was no>
ill feeling in the matter, a fair number of cartoons
were fixed on Mr. Watson's vehicles, which had
? e ?, r ?„ f° r the campaign the previous
night. .Enry, when he rose from his couch to
take a sniff of the morning breeze—and he can
I. , t, a , sni “’ no mistake—fancied he was in
Past Sydney again. Wherever he looked he saw
his beautiful phiz. The election proved to be a
hollow contest from the outset The poll opened
at » a.m.. but it was not till noon that the miners
washed themselves, and came down to vanquish
the Treasurer. Then the hollowness of the affair
was apparent. It was quite plain that Mr.
Watson had been inveigled into a contest where
inevitable defeat awaited him. According to all
accounts, the selection was made by air Henry
Parkes. Mr. Watson knew nothing of his
nomination till he arrived in Sydney from
oung, and, acting on the glowing repre-
sentations made him, he repaired to lila*-
w * rr *- xv. Slr - Enr y’8 bad judgment thus turned
what otherwise would have been an ordinary
defeat into a disastrous reverse lor the Govern-
ment. Mr. Stuart was too old a general not to
® the victory " (as the religious papers
put it), and the result was telegraphed to almost
every electorate in the colony, nil the Govern-
ment hacks got the fatal news in good time. Mr.
Stuart was awfully popular—even with the ladies,
which was an awful slight to Sir ’Enry, who is
decidedly plain. The victory, like every event
now occurring, was a big Press victory. Sir
Enry sneaked off to Wollongong, the Press
followed him, and before he got to Kiama, having
lelt Wollongong distressed, the cartoons and
reprint Press articles were there to welcome him.
Horace .Rogers represented the Hekalu— and
was not mesmerised by the great 1 AM. Mi*
telegrams were prompt and correct. As for The
Bulletin man, who also did a little for the
Lvbninq News, the Wollongong people wanted
to present him with a coal mine. He, however,
provided himself with a dozen skulls and shank
bones from the cemetery, and is satisfied. They
are now on view. Next week the delineation will
oome—and then people will know who were tho
early voters of Wollongong. The latest news is
that Young and Eoberts, 016., are in for the
Hastings, Purves for the Clarence, and Wisdom,
the Attorney-General for Morpeth,
Mr. W. A. Hutchinson, M. P. for Balmain.
On our front page this week is a portrait of
Mr - A -.Hutchinson, Mayor of Balmain, and
now M.P. for the electorate. Mr. Hutchinson is
a man of liberal principles, and stands out for
genuine political reform and honest legislation.

Mr. D. B. W. Sladen, the newly appointed pro-
fessor of English literature at the Sydney University,
is in Melbourne, and will shortly arrive and commence
his professional duties. He is unable to leave Mel-
bourne, however, without giving the Victorians a touch
of his poetic quality. The piece, portions of which we
shall quote presently, has, in view of the author’s posi-
tion, created some stir in Melbourne. It is rumoured
that, no sooner did the Melbourne University men read
it, than a deputation of the Senate waited on Mr. Sladen
and requested him with tears in their eyes to jilt
Sydney for them. The piece is called “ To the Austra-
lian Eleven,’’ and is ss full ef passionate fire as it is of
melting rhythm. In alluding to the welcome, our
gifted professor of English literature sings—
“ But you won the great match by downright pluck,
And accordingly Australasia
Accords such a welcome to her Eleven
As for peaceful triumph never was given."
What we require, he says, are
• And all-round men, such as Gillen and Jones,
And a * demon ’ to reinforce us,
In case we should be over-matched for once
Arid the foe beginning to course (sic) us.
; . 8 . • •
And another Horan to lay about him
Like Tommy, however, the foe may * scout ’ (sic)
him.”
All this is very fine. It betrays in every stanza the soul
of the poet, in every sentiment the enthusiasm of the
patriot, in every line the hand of the master. But Mr.
Sladen excels, perhaps, less in playful verse—though he
is great in that—than in poetry of a soulful—we had
almost said sonorous—nature. This stanza, for in-
stance, complete in itself, will permit an enquiring
public to at once gauge Mr. D. B. W. Bladen’s powers
ai a serious poet—
•' Let us pray that if ever Fate commands
Us to step into the arena
With foils without buttons on, hearts and hands
Be forthcoming without subpeena [111!]
To uphold the name of the kangaroo
As the Australian Eleven do.”
We have have not received intelligence respecting the
date of Mr. Bladen’s arrival, therefore we are unable to
give the cue to the corporation re the triumphal arches.
It is with pleasure, however, that we congratulate Sir
William Manning, Dr. Badham, and Co. upon their
good fortune in having secured the services of this
brilliant gentleman, who, we are, sure, will, before long,
make no less of a name as a litterateur in Sydney than
he has done elsewhere. In Queensland, it is said, they
will remember him for ever!

There have been several celebrated cremation
cases in England lately. The general feeling at home
seems to be against this method of disposing of the
bodies of the dead. Speaking philosophically the
reason for this prejudice is the belief in the Resurrec-
tion. Ton may, of course, go up to any man and tell
him that he is bound to die like the rest of mankind.
It he be a gentleman, he will listen courteously to this
platitude of yours, and let the question slide away on
the next tide of conversation. But ho will, neverthe-
less, go home with the secret conviction that his life is
going to be in some way or another a wonderful excep-
tion to the common lot. This is the sort of man-and
he is very common, mind you—who sets his face
against cremation. He doesn’t like it because he has
some faint idea that if his remains are burnt, he won’t
rise up a complete man when Gabriel sounds his trump.
We shake hands with him over this question. We
believe the present system of burial is unhealthy for
the living, and very possibly unpleasant for the dead.
But we are not strictly in favour of cremation for one
teas'"-.'' ./hich is—we think that in a young country,
such &s this is the useful should always take precedence
of the ornamental. We school ourselves to think in
this way for the good of the country, mind you.
What would we do with our dead if we had our own
way P Why, we would cremate them and put the ashes
in urns, inscribed with their respective names and
titles. This would be a splendid idea, for many reasons
We would come home one night, for instance, when we
would think that everybody’s hand was against us, and
have a morbid hatred of mankind in general. What weuld
we do then ? Why, simply take down the storied
urns, range them in a circle or semi-cirole, according to
their numbers, put before each urn the liquor that the
original of the ashes liked in life, and then sit down in
the middle and clink our glasses against each receptacle
of dust. This would be what Ossian calls the “ Joy of
Grief." Of course, this is the ornamental view of the
matter. If we had our way. all corpses would bo petri-
fied, and used either as fencing-posts or railway
sleepers. Any thoughtful person can imagine a hundred
other uses to which they might be put, but which we
have not time to deal with now. But wethink in either
of the two ways we have mentioned the dead can urn
a decent living.

And nought for the aimless strife
And the weariness men call Life.
The victor-laurel may wave
Like a flag o’er the hero’s grave,
And the thousand tongues of fame
Tell the world of his mighty name
For me, I prefer mine ease
To such graveyard glories as these.
There are who take stock in such,
But I own I had rather much
Live lazily while I may
Than be killed in a kingly way.
When the world ends once for all.
Who will reck then of great or email P
So here in the shade I lie.
Singing songs while the hours go by.
The sky is as blue this hour
As a field of tall flax in flower.
Who cares if the blue give place
To the hue of a dead man’s face
An hour hence P If God would give
Me one great hour wherein to live
At pleasure’s aupremest crest,
Why, the devil might have the rest;
For Life is a web of woes
Through which rarely a gold thread goes.
And such as we find, alack,
Are eternally barred with black.
Pshaw 1 Eound me the sunlight weaves
A fine laee-work of shadow-leaves j
Above, lone leaves on bis loom
Glow like stars of gold in the gloom,
And call up memories vain
Of a gold-topped divine champagne
I drank in the years of youth.
When good wine was as scarce as truth
Is now; but those years took wings
Like the rest of my best-loved things.
They died as all dear things die.
Yet I ait and stare at the sky
Like the men cf Galilee,
As if that which has been conld be
Again; yet my heart still cries
Like a fool’s for the dead to rise.
On the faint sky-verge afar,
Where the sea meets the shore, there are
Eosc-olouds like a curtain furled
Hound the rim of the rolling world :
There, where the foam, wind-fanned.
Is as white as a lady’s hand.
Did I drown my youth alone.
With my heart round its neck for atone.
Now I drown its memory
In a beaker $eep as the sea.
The sea is a drinking-bowl.
Bound its rim the wine-waves roll,
And the bubbles rise and laugh—
What a cup for the gods to quaff!
Ah! me, for the rose-crowned times
When red wine was a theme for rhymes.
And Love was the Poet’s pledge.
And the wine-sup’s gold-graven edge
As a sword’s edge flashed and shone
Through the songs of Anacreon.
The world has grown worse, I think.
Since those times; I will rise and drink.
Amaranth.
Once a poet—long ago—
Wrote a song as void of art
As the songs that children know.
Yet as pure as a child’s heart.
With a sigh he threw it down,
Saying, “ This will never shed
Any glory or renown
On my name when I am dead.
•* I will sing a lordly song
Men shall hear, when I am gone,
Through the years sound clear and strong
As a golden clarion."
So this lordly song he sang
That would gain him deathless fame —
When the death knell o’er him rang
No man even knew its name.
And when his freed soul had found
The glad place of singing souls.
And he saw their bright heads crowned
With song-woven aureoles,
He stood shame-faced in the throng.
For his brow of wreath was bare.
And, alas 1 his lordly song
Had grown sere in that sweet air 5
Then, all sudden, a divine
Light fell on him from afar.
And he felt the child-song shine
On his forehead like a star.
So forever. Each and all
Songs of passi m or of mirth
That are not heart-pure shall fall
As a sky-lark’s to the earth;
But the soul’s song has no bounds—
Like the voice of Israfel,
Prom the fieav’n of heav’ns it sounds
To the very hell of hell.
Oar Lady of Fear.
On an enchanted night it was.
When dreams grew corporate,
I prayed to see the face of her
Who should be my fair Pate;
Then I became aware
Of a strange 'ady there.
Around my neck she wound her arms—
And, oh I but they were white; —
She kissed mo on the mouth, methonght
It was a serpent’s bite ;
And with each burning kiss
I heard a serpent’s hiss.
And as I gazed at her, her great
Eyes grew to sea-deeps then.
Wherein, O ghastly sight 1 I saw
The bones of drowned men;
And saw at her heart’s core
A worm gnawed evermore.
She left me, bat I dream no more
Of woman’s love or grace.
Last in the night 1 should behold
The horror of her face.
And on the darkness rise
The corpse-lights of her eyes.

From a country correspondent’s letter to an

very visible last night. Its tail was about three chains

Mr. Bent, the Victorian Minister for Eailwaya,
is described bv a Melbourne paper, in an article on the
big smash at Hawthorn, as " a man with the intellect
of a turnip and the manners of the hog that roots it
up.”
In Java, an empty flower-pot on a window-sill

There are few towns so poor but they have some
particular excellence to boast of. " Walcha ” (N.S.W.)
says the local paper, with pardonable pride, “ has, for
its size and population, more prohibitions against
drunkards than any other town in the colony.” That's
the place for the Bum.
The Melbourne Age tells us that 'a Kilmore
man was the other night “ startled out of his sleep by
a burglar cutting his throat with a large carving-knife.”
Surely this can’t be true. The cause was too trifling.
The fellow with the “sawed” windpipe must either
have been a light sleeper, or a person who had been
rejected at the general election.
Whenever the Melbourne Cup is being run, the
interests of the British Empire demand that our squad-

Bay; and when the thermometer here shins up to 150
degrees in the shade, the crown of Her Majesty would
be jeopardised did not the Nelson oast its anchor in the
placid waters of the Derwent and bombard the hearts of
the Hobart girls.
The other day, the Lord Mayor of London, in
proposing the Queen’s health, remarked that Her
Majesty possessed gifts “bordering on the Divine.”
The other day, too, the editor of the Wagga Wagga

Three of the four advent sermons now being
delivered bv Archbishop Vaughan, are entitled re-

them his Grace advised those who chanced to wake up
on Advent nights, to “fry and think on death, and
imagine themselves in their coffins ’’ This is a nice
cheerful suggestion, which will, doubtless, find much
favour among those candidates who went up in the
Ministerial interest at the general election.

On Monday, at the opening of the Court of
Quarter Sessions, at Darlinghurst Court-house, when

“ Fined——” “ Av ye plase, yer ’Onner,” jerked out a

From the Down and Gtjmteek Jounal —
“K. J. W. writes: A man marries a girl and she dies
Is the man still the same relation to the parents of the
girl as before death ?—Yes. with the addition of being a
son-in-law.” It is gratifying to know on such indis-
putablo authority that Benedict is not a son-in-law till
his better-half turns np her toes. Nevertheless, we
should advise K J.W. to send the same conundrum -
along to the Shroud, which makes a special feature—

reaches half a dozen—of “Answers to Correspondents.”

At a municipal meeting up West, a few night*

floor. During the discussion the terms “ ass," “ ape "
“dog," and the “monikers" of several other
members of the brute kingdom were freely pelted, ana
soon after there was no disputing who held the fleor
whatever. The two orators had it to themselves, and
the Mayor acted as referee whilst the Town Clerk stood
by and made a most efficient bottleholder. These little
reunions help to rush business along considerably, and
do much to relieve the monotony of aldermanic duties.

They advertised a meeting of tha Boomerango-
waddy Jockey Club recently. Only two persons turned
up. These were the rival newspaper proprietors—tha
one a comp., the other the publican at whose house
the meeting was to be held. The publican immediately
moved the oompo. into the chair. Carried, without
opposition. The chairman opened the business by
ordering a pint of rum. The rent of the meeting moved
an amendment that it be fizz. Amendment carried
unanimously. The meetin g then continued to progrets
at the rate of two drinks to every ten minutes. The
utmost harmony prevailed, until the publican observed
that the editor of the Boomerangowaddy Bingkt was a
mean, wall eyed rhinoceros, whose father was born
without a shirt. The compo. replied with a tumbler,
the table and kerosene lamp were overset, and the two
went for each other in the dark, amid the screams cf
the family, who came to see what the row was about.
Each literary man thought he was getting the best of
it, and the execrations gasped out wore fearful to listen
to. When lights were brought, however, it was found
that the publican had got the local constable down in
one corner, and was putting his nose into shape with
the heel of his boot; while the compo. had the groom's
head in Coventry, and was pegging away contentedly.
When they saw their mistake, they let go their victims
and made a rush at each other. No sooner were they
writhing together on the floor than the constable and
the groom sailed in and finished them. They were
lastly taken to the watchhonse on litters. Fined £5
each, and costs.

Up like a rocket and down like the stick, is the
history of tho British Zoedono Company. About two
years age, it started with a flourish of crumpets and a
capita.! e.f £100.000. About four months ago it finished
with a free fight in the board room between irate
shareholders on one side, and the directors,assisted by
their j»s id clerks, on the other. Its oollipw resulted
from two causes ; first, because out of £100,000 capital,
A84 000 wag paid (or sail to bs paid) for tha patent
rights to make the drink, and the balasoe having been
spent in plant, the Company had to borrow money
to start working; and second, because nobody wanted
to dnnk* Zoedono when it was made. A London paper
thus describes this wonderful liquid, whioh was to
create a new and happy era in tne history of drink,
combining all the virtues ot all the intoxicants and
none of their faults ; “ We thought we might as well
try the compound: We paid an enormous pries for a
very small bottle. The first sip came on ns as a sur-
prise ; the second revived some eld recollections of
something, we knew net what; the third and last made
ua feel id, and we wont home to think. The result ef
our cogitations was that wa procured a bottle of ginger-
beer at twopence. Into thii we scraped tff the phos-
phorus from half-a-doon of Bryant and May’s safety
matches. We stirred the whole with a rusty iron key
we got out of the stable, and finally we produced a
mixture which resembled Zcodons so exactly that we
at once threw it away.”
At Bateman’* Bay, a somewhat serious kiok-up
has just occurred between husband and wife, which
will probably terminate In the Divoroe Court. It oawe
about thnsly:—The honest wife naod to take groat
pride in rearing Cochin-Chinas, Brahma-pootrae, and
ocher choice varieties of fowls. Htr lord and master
was also a bird-fancier, bat he had a weakness for wild
ones—such as parrots, magpies, cockatoos, and even
crows and hawks. A week or twe ago he found and
brought home two eagle’s eggs, and after a great doal
of coaxing, got his wife to allow him to “s t” them
under one ot her much-prized Brahms-puotras. Things
went on well until the other morning, when the
honest housewife opened the fowl house as to see
how her “clucking’’ hens (eleven in number) were
getting along. She was paralyzed to find them all gone.
Perched upon a rafter, gorged to the very eyes, asleep ’
and happy, were two half-fledged eagles, whose bloody
beaks and talena spoke volumes, while the feathers,
ones, and egg shells, whioh were scattered about the
floor of tho hue, “ like the leaves on the strand,’’ told
heir own grim and ghastly tale. Seizing a clothes-
prop, the enraged lady soon made short work of the
eagles, and than interviewed her unhappy sponse. . .

The D.T., on tho morning of tha Shoalhaven

by a mij ariby of about 57. All tha returns are not in.
but the remainder will not alter tha totil Mr. Hum-
phery was hooted, and his occupying the scat will pro-
bably be protested against " Now, as a mat er of fact
Mr. Humpbery was boo ed, if, indeed, he was hooted at
all, to exactly the same extent as Mr. Roseby was
similarly favoured. And as people know Mr. Hnmohery
to be a white man and a mau of letters, who would be
listened to attentively in any legislative assembly, they
are forced to regard the D T.’s assertion that “ hia
seat will be protested against" as mere Rum raving.
Mr. W. Muston, who said a fond farewell to his
£40 at St. Leonard 3 , appears from hia political pro-
gramme to be a venerable fossil who at some remote
epoch wps petrified in the colony. Ho had a handbill
out inviting the Wesleyans to vote for him because he'd
“ helped to build their beautiful chapel," and raised
funds for the minister’s stipend The Anglicans were
assrd to support him because he had given their church
a lift, and he based his claims to the E.O. vote on the
fact that when his Roman brethren were unable to
obtain altar flowers elsewhere they had procured a
supply from his garden. And than he intimated that
he looked forward to being supported by the Oddfellows
and by “ Fraternilsof the Mystic tie." But, despite all.
he lost his £40.

violent, it was blasphemous God’s name was invoked

Watson in the Iliawarra district. Thev asked that the
miners should bo brought up, iu order that they might
have au opportunity of addressing them. The boss
miner demurred, bir Henry P.irkes, he remarked, had
nothing to do with the mine (Mr. Stuart, by the way.
is one of tho principal shareholders), and he didn’t see
why tha_ men should he ask»d to waste their time.
Negotiations were still proceeding when tha captain of
the mine returned. He took in the situation, and then
took off his coat. Ho wanted to know, ha said, what the
devil the touts meant by abusing his ma»te'', Mr.
Stuart. It was just then that the men went away in a
buggy.

into a full-blown “honourable" of the Victorian Upper
House typo jet. He trie! hard, but there was too
much buttir in the mixture he offered to allow of the

doctor more to go for another seat, it will pay certain
of hu disinterested friends to run him for as many
electorates as they can. Bat he should be used to this
thing now, after his Bailliero experiences of
'Uj a year for tan years. And, bv tho way, it is «aid

This is the glowing eloquence in which Mr. A.
G. Taylor ("The Giraffe"), the gifted editor o£ tha
Indkpbnpkht, indulged during his candidature for
Madges" Ho firmly believed that when -.he all-
bountiful Creator endowed this, fair and smiling laud
with Ml the lavish evideners of natural fertility and
beneficent resources. He designed it for a territory
where the genius of liberty and tha glow of greatness
i should permanently prevail—where p mcc should never
be estranged from prospority, nor religion divorced
I from righteousness—whore the gilded glow of personal
integrity should envelope and environ ail the trans-
actions of civilised life—where honour should extirpate
fraud where virtue should banish vice—where the
dominion of truth shauld dealeu the arrogance of
falsehood—where, in the eve and estimation of true
ana loyaj-hearted men, individual excellence shall rank
before titular eminence and Q id-fearing labourers
before ‘gilded lordiiug, —where all tho external evi.
deuces of national grandeur shall coalesce with the
internal manifestations of domes io chivalry—where
the bhght of bigotry shall fade, and the tide of tyranny
shall eh a—where intellect shill burst the bonds of
ignorance where the republic of science shall subdue
tho empire of superstition—and where national sturdi-
ness and domestic strength shall combine with the
achievements of art and the triumphs of artisanry to
elevate Australia to the proudest pinnacle of national
pre-eminence.' Say, A.a., what about John Divies?
Mr. George Day, of “ Yarrabee compensation”
fame, has again been returned for Albury, by the very
small majority of nineteen—gained by the aid of his
church, tne faithful having been told from the altar to
vote for him: and then plenty of beer flowed. But
these influences combined would not have put Mr. Day
m had not two candidates opposed him, one of whom
glared the working man's vote. Tke poll was Day.
291; Hayes, 275; Gulson, 162: so, in reality, Day had
291 vot.es recorded in his favour, and 437 against him,
thus showing that in the electorate the bulk of the
voters dm t believe in G. D. It is io be regretted that
through want of unity a minority succeeded in electing
an old regime representative. Kot once daring his
visit to Albary has Mr. Day cflerod the slightest ex-
planation or excuee re his alleged part in the Yarrabee
compensation jobbery. After the informal announce-
ment of the poll oa p illing-day, h.« stated that he had
been under a cloud, and that to-morrow (referring to
the official declaration of the poll on the following
morning) he would shine forth as the son from

some excuse for his conduct, when returning thanks
tor his election. But they were disappointed— ro
reference being vouchsafed to the little transaction.
Mudgee has been enlivened with some fanny
election squibs levelled against the inevitable David,
somebody ha* been raking over Dave’s speeches, and
quoting titbits therefrom. He is shown to have buttered
the squatters on 11th Octebe*, and to have denounced
the selectors thusly : —“ But the selectors were let loose
upon the land in every direction, striking the key-note
of destruction and ruin to this important industry
(squatting) in which he was engaged." Again, his
opinion on the abolition of interest on Pree-selectors'
balances was rubbed up and bronght out afresh : —“ The
man who could seriously propose such a thing is, by
the very constitution of him, a robber—the wh-'le bent
and tendencies of his disposition are towards theft. I
wou d not trust such a man beyond my eye—rely upon
it, nothing bat dread keeps him from robbery ” Then
the Good Templars were rought to he arrayed against
David the Machiavellian raker-up of orations
Buchanan s description of the typical teetotaller ben g
given: "A mean, emaciated, yellow-skinned individual,
whose stomach is hopelessly disordered, walking about
clothed in a garb rf worldly sanctity, with no fear in his
heart of giving offence to God, bur, troubling in every
joint at the bar, thought of giving ttfencj to man.
This is the individual, the very si*ht of whom gives me
an intense hankering to soizs him by tho heels and
plunge him head-foremost into a puncheon of rum, as
the very first step to enlighten him as to hi, drink
question and its bearings." Next, David was taken in his
Lhmophilo aspect, and is reproduced saying of the
Gbii.esa, " An inferior race, forsooth I " and comparing
Englishmen unfavourably with them. Further on
came an appeal ta the “Licensed Victuallers,"
whom David accused of diminishing the quantity in a
pint, for had he not appealed te hon. members to ob-
serve "how villainously small our glasses have become P“
Lastly, David’s euiogium on the merits of Chinese as
soldiers, and his sneer at “what is vulgarly called
British pluck." was given full vent to, with the appended
appeal" Natives I Put out this libeller of your
country.” All of which is exceedingly hot on the only
David, and means that he has at one time or another
abused every section of the community. But David

A holy-looking, fully-ordained creature, the
Esv. Mr. Something, arrayed in solemn black and f ir-

way station, which, when Judge Manning's libel law ia
dead and stack cd amongst the decisions of tbe Supreme
Court of the i ver-drife or pal® dir,hia period, we will
name. He, tL-t is to say, this beatified humbug, who
wears a smile like a benediction and has a foot nineteen
inches long, is eternally on the look-out for a fresh
woman to speak to. Ho prowls around the railway plat-
form before the departure of a train, sometimes spends
teo minutes in following a lady npaud down the waiting-
p ace, and invariably presumes to address her should
she be unescorted and look at him in a surprised or
enquiring manner. The ocher morning he had the im-
pudence to speik to a lady at whom, with soapy
nnotuonene.is.te had frequently leered on like occasions.
She at once remarked that she did not know him.
th )ugh he had more than once ventured to gria at
her in a most offensive way; that whatishc had seen
of him had convinced her that he was better
adapted for insulting women than ho was for preach-
mg toe gospel—and that her husband was on tbe
platform, and would on his return from too ticket-office
speedily settle accounts. The husband came back, and
on being acquainted with the position, at once pro.
coeded to inquire by what authority the holy one had,
without an introduction, ventured to address his wife.
The Eiverend Mr. Something replied “that ha was—
ar a clergyman—that it was a minister’s privilege—er,

long known by sight and wished to see amongst his
congregation that, er, —it wjs oalv his anxiety for the

(height—6ft, lin.), “ lu respect to my wife you hate no
more privilege by virtue of your coat than thit railway
labourer has hr virtue of his moleskins If you wished

The cooperation of ehareh-vlders enables the com-

this rate, also, shareholder! have the option of re ain-

SPOSTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The final match of the first division for the
Parcels Cup is to be commenced on Saturday by the
Our Boys’ and St. Peter’s clubs.
Arrangements have been completed for a match
between the Hon. Ivo B'igh’s team and the Australian
Eleven on the Adelaide Oval early next month.
The 2nd March is the day proposed by Eush for
the contest between him and Lavcock. To which of
them stall we say, “Beware, the Idea of March ?”
The charge against J. Boland, who conducted a
sweep under the title of “ Arch-medium” was dismissed
on a technical oh j action to the wording of the sum-
mons.
The Herald sent the Synod man up to report
the Maitland match. Ho sayw: “ Bates was clean
bowled by Bignell off his pads. Tyleoote carried out his
bat tot 16, not out."
The match between the Tamwo’-th Eighteen and
the English Eleven was not comm need on Monday,
owing to the heavy rain. The visitors were accorded a
hearty reception by the townspeople.
The South Australian Coursing Club presented
Mr. J. S. Stirling, M.P , with a large silver oalvar and
album in recognition of his services as honorary indge.
A sterling judge, of course, is worth sterling silver.
At the annual meeting of the Adelaide Racing
Club, it was stated that the receipts had been £19 597,
including £4i20 from the totalisator. The committee
of the olnb must be totalisatorsfied with the instrument
as a means of revenue.
Mr. O. Giffen, in recognition of his splendid per-
formances with the Australian Eleven as a represents-
tive of South Australia, was presented at the Adelaide
Oval oa Saturday week with a very handsome gold
watch. His thanks were Giffen.
The cable tells ns that “the London Daily
News, referring to the victories recently gained by the
Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team in Australia, rejoices that at
last the pride of colonial cricketers is being humbled.”
It will almost do us good to be humbled.
It is not probable that there will be a chance
for the Sydney public to see Dr. Curtis exhibit his
bicycling powers for some time if at all, as he intends
to take up a country practice, and consequently will
have little time or opportunity for bicycling. He has
brought with him several bicycles and also a double
tricycle for himself and Mrs. Cortis.
The slowest race ever run was the Derby of
“ Andover’s” year, as it took three days to win it:
Thomas Day owned the colt, John Day trained him, and
Bill Day rode him. And by cablegram we learn poor
John has just started for that “ Forced Handicap” for
which we must all enter. Let us hope he will “get a
place,” for he was an honest man, and a bully trainer.
In the prison quarry of Carson, Nevada, foot-
prints have been discovered measuring eighteen inches
long. The Academy of Science at once held an inquest
on the trackv, and decided that they were made Dy a
mammoth, or some other gigantic pro-historic animal,
but wa know better than that- Ivo Bligh was over
“ thar” once with a team of cricketers. Hence this
thusness.
After all it is very likely that the N.S.W. Row-
ing Association will get a now boat for our representa-
tive crewin the next Intercolonial eight-oar race. It is
onlv by attending to such trivial matters that we gain
a chance of securing a victory. By leaving them alone
we give the other side an opening.
The Bathurst people want to see the English
cricketers at the City of the Plains. They offer £100
and railway fares for a two days’ match. It seems the
manager of the Melbourne Club can’t sae his way clear.
Bathurst says the Englishmen are sure to come up the
Una to sen the sights, and why can’t they come on to
Bathurst? Zigzagly so.

The first race of the season under the auspices
of the Sydney Amateur Sailing Cliab took place on
Saturday (or the club prize for the 16-feet dingies.
Five boats started. The course was frem moorings
round Shark Island, round flagboat moored off Port
Macquarie Point, thence roundSfiark Island, and back
to tbe tUgboat. The finish was aa follows: Ou ; da, 5
hours 22 rain.; Nereid, 5 hours 22 min. 40 sec.; Violet,
5 hours 23 min. 47 tec.; Regina, 5 hours 25 min, 29 sec.
The advent to the corners cf our city of resplen-
dent gentlemen with horsey pocket-books, announces
tbe coming Christmas racing festival. The betting
market has been fairly brisk, the public popping it on
individual fancier, no stable having yet made any
decided move. Carmelite, Yaktta, Nancy Lee, and The
Cockney are most fancied for the Hummer Cup. There
is little doing over the Tattersall's.
The match for the Furness Cup between the
Raymond and Surrey United Clubs resulted in a victory
for the latter by eight wickets, the scores being:—
R O.G., first innings, 83—J. Wilson (not out) 39, Baker
15j second innings, 113—Baker 00, Mihill 18, Watkins
11. S.U.C.C , first innings, 190—J. Saarle 38, Beveridge
86, C. Neweombe 33, Freeman 20, Thompson 18, New-
land 14. Second innings, two wickets for 12.
At the Melbourne General Sessions, the con-
victions against three persons who were sentenced to
a fortnight’s imprisonment for playing the three card
trick at the Plemington racecourse, were quashed on
the ground that it was not a game of chance, but skill.
No one but those who are “ had " at the trick could
possibly see any ohauoe about it, and the whole of the
skill used is on the side of the manipulator of the cards.
The very fact of its being pronounced officially as a
game of skill ought to protect the unskilled ones from
being fleeced by its professors.
The Port Jackson Swimming Club hold their
opening matches of the season at Robinson’s baths
about the beginning of January. The programme com-
prises 11 events, the principal being:—The Summer
Cup, 500yards; Men-of-War’s race, 300 yards ; Members’
Maiden, 200yards; Members’ Handisap, 200 yards; AU
Schools’ race, for boys under 16,150 yards; and cham-
pion, 100 yards. Entries may be made daily at the
baths, and ail communications should be addressed to
the hon. secretary, Mr. P. Q.;C. Honslow, Campbell-
street, Paddington.
The match between the English Eleven and the
Newcastle Eighteen resulted in a draw very much in
favour of the English team. The English team made
the fine score of 339—Read 61, Leslie 51, Vernon 41,
B irlow 39, Bates (not out) 34, Tyleoote 33, Steel 25, Ivo
Biigh 22, Barnes 13. The Newcastle Eighteen scored
in the first innings 67—Smith 13, Maddison 12, Bryant
11; in the second, 15 wickets for 54 —Bogera 11. In the
first innings, Studd got seven wickets for 10 runs, Steel
seven wickets for 36; in the second. Steel got ten
wickets for 29 runs, and Studd five (=r 23.
The South Australian fifteen made a good show
agaiust the Australian Eleven. la the first innings
they made 117—Jarvis 19, King 19, Richards 17, Gooden
(not out) 15. In the second innings 254 —Gooden 52,
Jarvis, 43, Lyons 21. Godfrey 20, Hide 18, Richards 18.
Waldron 10 The Australians made 217 —Murdoch 39,
Giffen 38, M’Donnell 35, Bannerman 32, Blackham 16,
Boyle 12, Jones 10. In the first innings Spofforth got
seven wickets for 54, Boyle three wickets for 40, Giffen
three wickets for 12. In the second innings Spofforth
got three wickets for 49, Giffen six wickets for 71, Boyle
five wickets for 85.
Barnes, who is one of the best English pro-
fessional batsmen, was sent in second last in the iate
match against Now South Wales. He was vary much
annoyed thereat, but he got his recompense by being
sent in first at Maitland in the rain When N.S. Wales
got eight of the English wickets down, some of the
colonial team began to think their hard work was over.
Barnes emerged, bat in hand, from the pavilion.
“ Look out," said Ted Powell, “ they say this chap is a
better batsman than Ulyett." Turner dropped the
ball with astonish-uent: “ What anotaer leviathan, ?”
he cried, “ how many more of them ?”
A number of gentlemen interested in rowing
matters are endeavouring to form a rowing club for
Woolloomooloo Bay. Now that soma attention is
drawn to ihe matter, all the am iteur scullers begin to
wonder that the convenient bay, which was, and Is now,
studded with boat-sbeIs—which is the arena for
impromptu matches, the course irom Cowper Wharf
round Pinchgut and back being as papular as the
Champion Course on Parramatta Rivet—has not been
availed of before this as the head-quarters Of a rowing
club. Success is a certainty if the promoters be ener-
getic. A meeting of persons favourable to the forma-
tion of a clnb is to b« held to-night (Thursday), at
Sieve Punch’s Hotel, William-street. “Charon,” is
making all necessary arrangements. We wish the
promoters success.
The five men that are to join the N.S.W. con*
timrent of the Australian Eleven to play for N.S, Wales
in the Intercolonial match should be: Evans, Davis,
Hiddlestoa, D. Gregory, and Cleeve or Downes. By
the bye, is it a settled fact that the six Australians
will play ? Spofforth always requires a lot of persuasion
end, like Byron’s heroine, “vowing he will ne’er
consent, consents." Murdoch, it is well known, has
openly stated that he will never play in an Intercolonial
match. But then, the “honour” of NS. Wales
demands that private considerations should be sub-
merged. We do not know how the rest of the travellers
look at it, but we shall not be surprised if one or two of
the N.S.W. men decline to play from some trivial
reason.
The match between the English Eleven and the
Maitland Eighteen was played in the rain, and the
Maitland men were beaten in one innings by fifteen
runs, without counting the mud The Englishmen
were first at the wickets, and compiled 155 runs. Barnes
getting top-score, 25, in the rain. Barlow came next
with 24; Alexander, who played (or G. B. Studd
—who had. a cold) also hit np 24. Vernon
made 21, Tyleoote 16, W. W. Read 12. C. F. Leslie
made 6, and was run out. He also had to play in
the rain. When he oame out to bat, he received the
ovation dne to the great Oxford oolt. When he went
back he was a wettur ’nn. Maitland made a poor show.
In the first innings the total was 49, M’Alpin 15 being
the only donble-figara scorer. In the second innings
91 runs were made, the highest scorers being Onus 29,
Hermann 15, Sawyer 12, bmith 12. A. G. Steel in the
first innings got eight wickets for 28 runs; in the
second, six wickets for 37, and C. T. Studd seven
wickets for 39. Yet somebody said that these boys
were nothing on the trundle. We are mistaken if they
are not very much on it.
Twelve competitors started in the handicap
skating race at Botany on Saturday; distance, three
miles, forty times round. Moyse, Set-right, Cunningham
and Hackett went from scratch; William and
M’Laughlin had a quarter-lap start; Fry, Waugh and
dunes, half-lap; Rolfe, threo-quarter-lap; and two
Eiohlers. one and a quarter each. All tbe skaters being
amateurs, the handicapping was necessarily guessy, and
some men did not get nearly enough start. Several
spills occurred, and a tumble going at fourteen miles
an hour is no fnn either. The pace was a “ cracker ”
all through, and the winner, H. Moyse, did the three
miles from scratch in 12min. 16. ee. A Fry landing on
all (outs three yards behind—a knee-sy second. Hackett,
when going well, ran his head against a post—and dinted
the post. He explained afterwards that was why he
didn’t win the race. One competitor, elaborately got
up in purple stockings and velvet knickerbockers, had
his breast nearly covered with medals. However, he
didn’t meddle with the race much, and his velvet pants
soon disappeared like a beautiful dream. The others
oceup ; ed the same distinguished position p.s a comet’s
tail. The prizes, two gold medals, were immediately
handed over by Mr. Frank Smith, who managed the
affair wel’.
The following are the thirteen selected to proceed
to Melbourne on Friday, to represent N. S. Wales in the
Intercolonial Match ;—A. Bannerman, Cleeve, Davis,
Evans, Fletcher, Garrett. David Gregory, Hiddleston,
Jones, Massie, Murdoch, Powell, and Spofforth. Mur-
doch telegraphed that he would be unable to keep the
wicket, and the committed have selected Fletcher as
being the best substitute available. It is to be hoped,
if ho be finally chosen, that he will have some practice
with Spoffoith’s fast ones as he has not a-yet performed
so well as to ensure any great quantity of confidence in
him behind the sticks in an Intercolonial Match. Sear’e,
Hannah, and Callaohor are much better men in that
position, though they do not bat so well as Fletcher.
However, a wicket-keeper was wanted, not necessarily a
batsman. The sub-committee to decide for the final
team in Melbourne are Messrs. Fletcher. Nunn, and
Evans. Mr. Gibson is the irapressario of the team, and
onr only James is to officiate as umpire. The team is
satisfactory, with the one exception referred to. If
Murdoch would descend from his pinnacle of fame, and
take the wicket, then N. 8. Wales would be represented
by her strongest Eleven.

a recant match in Exmouth puo on no fewer than 206
runs in one hour and twenty minutes. In the same
game, a bowled ball passed through the wicket without
removing a bail A standard work on cricket is edited
by Charles Box and published by Horace Cox—a curious
juxtaposition of names The Bar. Mr. Orietoa had a
vein in his leg burst trom a blow from the ball in a
game played on August 25, in Southaea. He was stand-
ing at square leg, when the bail was hit hard towards
him One of the most extraordinary feats in rapid
scoring to.sk place recently in a game between the
Strathmore and Ht. Lawrenoe clubs. The btrathmores
were assisted by Captain Rcnny-Tailyour and J. M.
Ramsay, who scored respectively 249 and 119. The pair
kept together for live hours, and •* booked " 370 beiore
they parted. The Strathmore score (for the loss of six
wickets) was 474 W. H. Fowler, of Somersetshire—
one of the hardest hitters in England—drove the ball
157 yards from hit to pitch on a recent occasion, and
scored loO runs in 56 minutes against the Marylebone

Gloucestershire has unearthed a rising star in W. W. F.
Pullen. This colt, aged sixteen years and two months,
who has but just, left sohoo), played a superb innings of
71 for Gloucestershire against Yorkshire in Cheltenham.
His coolness, j udgment and skill were the theme of
general admiration. He played all the Yorkshire
bowlers with equal confidence, and hit the only five in
the game, besides six 4’s and seven 3’s C. E. Liles,

performed his memorable feat ef walking twenty-one
miles in three boors, on the road, at Newcastle, several
walkers have accomplished the same task, but always
on tbe ashen path, as level and t mooth as a tennis-lawn,
and more or lees sheltered from the wind. With the
idea of extinguishing for ever the undoubted value of
Westhall’s performance, seeing the conditions under
which it was executed, Thatcher.the pedestrian, who has
now been long before the public, announced his intention
of walking twenty-two miles in the same time, and on
the same road. He did not add “and in the same
weather;" but this (proved unnecessary, lor he failed
utterly in his task, and gave it up long before time had
expired.

A compositor named Joseph Eaton recently
died in the Walgett Hospital from cirrhosis of the
liver. The liver of an average healthy man should
weigh 55 ounces, but deceased’s, owing to the effects of
alconol, had been increased to 12 lbs. It wasn't Eaton,
but drinking.
For twenty years they have been throwing stones
into the water at the mouth of the Clarence, trying to
block up the entrance to the river. Scores and scores
of thousands have been spent, and they have succeeded
at last. And the dredge has been at work five years,
endeavouring to pump the water out of the river in-
stead of removing the sand from the stationary parts
of it.

Writes a correspondent: “ This is how squatters
get the bulge on dog-or-dingo poisoners in the Gwydir
district. Before serving out the strychnine they
weaken it with other chemicals, so that, although it is
almost certain death bo the dog, he will run some miles
before he drops, doing away with all chance of obtain,
ing his scalp (to the dog-poisoner). Therefore, £1
saved to the squatter. The men are chasing the shadow
to oitch the substance.” Wodon’t exactly see how you
can " weaken” strychnine with other chemicals.
On the South Pacific coast recently, a freight
train was **ditched,” and the fireman was pinned to
the ground by an iron bar across his breist, while one
foot was caught by another. The tide of a fast-flowing
river was rising near him. Six men tried all ways ef
getting him ont, including trying to pull him oat by
main strength at risk of broken limbs, but in vain.
They built a levee under his head, and started I a h g
out the rising water At last tte levee broke, ana
bating was useless. The men found they must make a
final effort, so his head was lowered, and they a 1 caught
hold and pulled desperately, but in vain-they could not
move him. They raised his head, but the water rose
slowly, and reached his chin. A friend held his hand
over his month, but the water rose to his nostrils;
nothing more could be done, so he was drowned.

Correy’a cosy grounds were the scene of a nice
li t h garden party on Saturday, given as a compliment,
to Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Geddes, of Botany, Good
music was produced by a baud of six, and refreshments
provided by Corroy and his hindy daughters. Some-
times the ladies, in their light, gay raiment, scattered
over the trim lawn, and sometimes the company danced
in the paviaon. Hera wonld be a pair doing Noah’s
Ark business along the sands; aud there
would bo seen taking gulps of enjoyment as the strong
anus of her fond Bitzgubbins sent her to and fro on
the pendent swing Mr. Parker managed the party
well, and was as good-humoured as he is big, Mr. and
Mrs. Geddes, senior, and three vivacious daughters, of
graduated sizes, were there from the Glebe; also three
nice girls in white from the Waterworks. A charming
little lauy, and the champion swimmer, came from the
Telegraph Office, 'two listers from the Glebe, two
from Burwood, a builder’s pretty daughter from Ultimo
in white, and a little damaol from Plsdfern in black,
helped to throw ligat aud shade on the toana. After
tea, th-healch of Mr. and Mrs. Geddes w,i proposed
hy Mr. Parker, and responded to; after which, Mr
Quong Tart undertook the responsibility of toasting
maladies. He gaye a deeply interesting lec.ure on the
softening influeuces of woman, and was then helped
down amid lots of laughter, to be smiled on for the
rest of the evening. We confess at once we are utterly
unable to reproduce his remarkable speech on paper;
but wc distinctly understood him to request eveiy one
to drop in at the Arcade and sample h.s new season’s
orange-scented pekoe, and we intend to go. The tram
ca no along at half-past nine.

Nithadale Rooms were filled by a large party ot
small people on Monday night, wnen Messrs. H. P.
Needs and Sons gave their afternoon and juvenile
classes a ball. A good proportion came in fancy char-
acters. An early start was made with a polonaise ; all
marching round in pairs, going through evoiuii mo,
under hands, four aoroast, casting oil, ringing round
the room, aud then finishing with another procession
and a polka. These characters were noteworthy: two
young nephews of the 41 thrice elected ” as kings in a
small way, clad in parti-colourod satin and velvet; on»
daughter of a Hebrew j iweller of King-street as a
picturesque Spanish girl, and the other a vivanditre,
in bright blue satin with white facings, gaily trimmel;
then two little mites from Castlareagh-atreat, who
appeared as miniature representatives of an old English
lady and gentleman in complete and correct costumes
and wigs. Two tiny sisters from Eegonc-i tret, Ridtern,
appeared as a fairy with short skirts and wings, and as
Winter in white diaphanous raiment fluffed withsuppo-
sititious snow, aud on her black curls was a white plush
hat with one small bird on its bop—a dear little
character. Two very small brothers were sailors, and
there were many soldiers, jockeys, and so on.
Two little blue satins from Balmain danced a Highland
flit g. Among the elders, a daughter of a dealer in tho
mystic was quite a belle in her light pink satin;
and another light pink was a sweet dancer. Pro ,ty
Patience was there with her big sunflowers; and a
cardinal satin trimmed with white lace was one of many
nice dresses. Another juvenile was the son of a
builder, in cricket flumel; he had been bmlb about two
stories too high for ordinary human purposes, but If he
smoked cigars on South Head he'd make a first-olisa
lighthouse. All sorts of joys, toy?, games, electric
sheets, w. refurnished in abundance for the little folks,
and they 41 wired in" to them very effectually too.

The piece is in throe acts, tho libretto of Mr Robert
Reece having been translated into Australian, and fur-
nished with new songs by a gentleman who chooses to
be known us “ Paequln." Mr Gordon has been very-
hard at work indeed, on the scenery, some of the stage-
pictures being very elaborate; and ail ot them correct
and appropriate. Mr. Frank Somers produces "Sin-
bad the Sailor,” written by Brauk Qrcen, and
thoroughly overhauled and adapted to locdn quire-
meats by a gentleman without spectacles. Brans will
plav his old part Ali Bea Sloper, and Miss Rosa
41 Sinbad " Ths piece is being beautifully mounted,
aud ought to "get 'em" to some tunc. We hope it
will, for Brank deserves a throw in. A striking texture
in the burlesque will be the introduction of a number
of trained children, and tho singing of a new patriotic
song, 4 ‘ Hare's a Health to our Warriors brave," by
Miss Towers —both the words and the music having
been specially composed for her.

At 3 o’c’ock on Tuesday, Mr William Hudson,

married by the Rov. Canon Stephen to Mis* Maggie,
third daughter of Mr, D. C. M 4 Uachian, of Pitt-strue’,
K dfern. The choir of St. Paul’s Church volunteered u
full choral service, and tho building was crammed before
the ceremony commenced, both tho chief persona con-
c-rned having a large circle of friends. Iho pretty bride
was apparelled in white satin trimmed with eidelweiss
lace and orange blossoms, nnd eight maids attended
her, v z :—Miss Hudson, Miss M’Lachlan. and her
sisters Jessie, Helen and Chrissie, Miss S Vicars, and
t wo litt e dots. Misses Ethel and Elsie Hudson. Six

Eighty sat to table, and the speeches were pithy, Ganen
Stephen humourously pi op ping the health of the
4 Bride and Bridegroom " and Mr. Norm in Selfe

were whistled away by the train fi r the honey moen at

The ancient town of Wellington was the scene
of gBf’at festivity last Friday niehr,, on the occasion of
a ball given bv the Squire of Gobolion, Mr. J. A
Gardiner, to celebrate tue twenty-first birthday of hi*
son, Willie. As the hospitable invita’ions were numer-
ous, the Band Hall was crowded, but there was room
for ns to ca*ch a glimpse of the most attractive terpsi-
choraans. Mrs. Gardiner wore black satin tri uesed in
gorgeous style; while the three married daughters of
the hon»e were attired in cream silk trimmed with car-
dinal. The youngest and unmarried daughter was
bewitching in a dress of pale blue satin ; and, with a
Dubbo young lady in white satin with pink trimmings
—who is equally attractive for her conversational
charms and perfect tripping—chared the honour of
belie. Nevertheless, some favoured the claims of a
young lady in all white muslin; others, of a pensive
maiden in pick silk from a neighbouring town. Dabbo
sent a matron elegantly dressed in black satin, whose
graceful dancing might well be studied by more youth-
fnl devotees. Amongst the gentlemen were a real live
K C M G , a District Court Judge, and a host of lesser
legal men. Dancing terminated at 8 a m. on Saturday,
just in time to catch the train ; and as languid maidens
ae.d done-up youths wended their way to the station, it
was generally admitted—even though headaches were
“on,” and soda sought for—that the pa<t night was one
of intense enjoyment. And Gardiner, jun., may rest
as-urred that the annual recurrence of his birthday
will be looked for by the young ladle* of Dubko and
Wellington with a yearning anxiety they never feci for
anything else—but the ncxi Bulletin.

as giving colonials a justly-deserved reputation of
" blowing.” He was ednoated at Windsor and Harrow,
and for many years hu filled * responsible position in the
Post Office. His society writings are not remarkable for
depth, but are superficially light and amasisg. He
died of Bright's disease.
Mr. C. S. Pucker has just composed an exqui-
site schottischa. His mine is sufficient guarantee (or .
the origimlity of the musio, which is at the earn* time
exceedingly attractive and pleasiev. '1 he tit e should
prove a draw. It is ‘called •* A Ro mini sconce of the
Garden Palace,” and the cover is embellished with two
exscl'ent lithos of the Palace before and after the fi c,
the sketches being from the facile and well-known
pencil of Mr. W. Micleod, The alliir is evidently a
great hit, judging from the manner in which it is going
oil The publisher is M. A. Humerbeb, 411 George-
stieet. and the fortune he is going to make out of it will
be sufficient to make the ghosts of Mozart and Handel,
and the other buffers, sit down b-neath their native
mountains and howl their heads eff with envy.
The Orient was this trip chock full of brides—
imported by all sorts of fellows iu all the colonies.
Brookshan, one of the Joyce family murderers,
was let off with ten years’transportation. Vet, it is
not so long since a child at home was sentenced to

The last act in a religious drama. Shepherd,
the Timaru (N Z ) lay preacher, who recently did the
Pacific slope wltn some thousands, after preaching a
farewull germ>n on honesty, who “blued’’ the money
in ’Frisco, and who then came back meekly for his
gruel, shot himself dead with a revolver simultaneously
with the opening of the Court for his trial on Tuesday
last.
Giffen, the Adelaide cricketer, has, it appears,
been offered a Government billet in Sydney. He ha*
not exactly accepted the offer, tut ua* intimated that
something of the sort must be found for him in South
Australia it they want to keep him there. Now-a-diys,
the road to the Civil service goes through the cricket
field. In Victoria, Horan, Biaokham, and others were
“ put on tic Government stroke " to prevent them from
leaving the colony. The most independent Civil ser-
vant iu the whole Australian Eleven is Alick Banner-
man, and be is a galley slave in the Government Print-
