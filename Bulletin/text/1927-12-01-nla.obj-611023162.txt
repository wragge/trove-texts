The Inky Way in China
I went to. Nanking in the company of an
editor. Mr. Blank was an Englishman, but
—such are the vicissitudes of journalism in
China—his mission was to discover for
himself the true position in the perennial
civil war, so that he could arrange for a
subsidy for his journal from the party most
likely to come out triumphant. Newspaper-
dom in the Flowery Land is inextricably
interwoven with the twisted skein of Celes-
ti'al politics. My editor, or his paper, had
become an impassioned advocate of repub-
licanism as a cure for China’s ills when the
Revolution first broke out in Wuchang 17
years ago, and the grass-fire speed with
which the mandarins discarded their caps
for the hardhitter of democracy amply
justified his faith. Then the Manchu Court
suddenly brought Yuan Shih-k’ai out of
retirement. Yuan was a fat, bow-legged
autocrat with a cynical heart and a level
head. He saw that the people loved shib-
boleths even above full ricebowls, and he
declared for republicanism instanter. At
the same time he kept a tight hand on the
revenues coming in and the railways going
out ot Peking. It. was on one of his railways
that Mr. Blank sped to the capital. Here
he lobbied the princes until he penetrated
to the President himself. In a few weeks
he returned to Shanghai—his journal of
popular liberties was safely installed out
of reach of Chinese vengeance in that inter-
national Alsatia—with a new subsidy, a
contract to supply 10,000 copies weekly to
the Government for distribution in foreign
countries, and a button of the 42nd rank or
its new equivalent. Whereupon the paper
became more fervently republican than
ever.
Yuan, however, put unexpected strains
on Mr. Blank’s journalistic ability. The
aged statesman was an enthusiast
liamentary government—until the parlia-
mentarians refused to vote his budget.
Then he sacked some, beheaded a few, had
more knifed and some of the more influen-
tial he disposed of by sending them pre-
sents of old Ming, with infernal-machines
concealed inside them. Thus he got rid
of approximately 400 chosen representa-
tives of the sovereign masses, replacing
them with his poor relations. My editor
sweated blood and grew grey-headed in
the effort to reconcile republican ideals with
these events, and as his helper in a small
way I had weekly tournaments with my
conscience; but the paper always sur-
mounted every obstacle, and only the most
severely logical mind could have found
fault with its masterly chain of reasoning.
I inally Y uan decided that an emperor was
the proper head for a republic, and pro-
ceeded to crown himself. My editor broke
a blood-vessel that week over his leading
article; but mercifully Yuan was presently
given bamboo splinters with his breakfast.
After that the changes in republican
politics were too rapid even for the fine
speed of Mr. Blank, and for some years he
turned his organ into a popular science
journal, with the object of training Young
China in the mechanics of Western civili-
sation.
A mysterious Japanese gentleman in a
very shiny top-hat and a cloud of the
longest words in the English language then
arrived and swept Mr. Blank into the
political stream Once more. I never dis-
covered who the Nipponese apparition was
or whom he represented. He could use more
words m saying nothing than a Cabinet
Minister enjoying his fifteenth term of
office. He released a welcome flow of yen
o\ er the office, and then suddenly dried up
and vanished. I fancy he was an agent of
some Japanese commercial undertaking
which hoped, by financing another spon-
taneous uprising of the Chinese proletariat,
to obtain iron and coal concessions in
Hupeh province. Anyhow, there was a
fresh revolution shortly after he departed,
and most of the uniforms of the generals,
the military textbooks pored over by their
lieutenants and the munitions fired into the
empyrean bore Japanese trade-marks.
on Jy as a spectator that I journeyed
with Mr. Blank to Nanking. That desic-
cated city has probably been declared a
capital oftener than any other place in
existence. It was the capital of the Wu
(3rd century a.d.), of the Eastern Ts’in, the
Southern Ts’i, of Kao Tsung, of the
Aan Sung emperors, of the Ming slaugh-
terers, of the T’aiping murderers, of the
moderate Communists in 1927 and of the
immoderate ditto in the same year. When
its unfortunate inhabitants learn that it
is again about to be promoted to a
capital , they retire into holes and
crannies. Friar Odoric in the four-
teenth century found Nanking a vast
and glorious city with 360 stone bridges,
finer than the rest of the world could show
great store of all good things and circum-
vallatmg walls 40 miles in circumference.
A , walls are still there, but inside them
tlie city rattles like a dry pea in a pod. l
l Jio peasant passes his plough over the
Imperial courts, and the proprietors of the
flower-boats, where warriors were wont to
carouse on warm wine and melon-seeds with
ghost-faced girls upon their steel-clad knees
are the only people who don’t complain of
the trade depression.
Nanking has a hill-fort inside its walls
and another outside them, and Mr. Blank
and I watched from the ruined railway-
station Southerners and Northerners ex-
changing foreign shells with great regularity
but no precision. In each combatant army
was a corps which had made itself invul-
nerable by incantations. To test the effi-
cacy of the spell some members of the corps
were put before a firing-squad and shot in
the stomach every morning just before the
zero hour. Half the firing-party had blank
cartridges and the other lethal bullets.
Those of the invulnerable who fell had
obviously been loafing at their incanta-
tions ; and, thus heartened, the survivors led
the attack, bursting with contempt for their
adversaries. Periodically an offensive
developed according to a schedule previously
arranged between the two commanders; but
as the generals were being paid on a
commission basis for the ammunition they
expended, this form of warfare was apt to
be indecisive. *
Mr. Blank stayed three days and came
away disillusioned. Although it is hard to
be funny in a land where the mother-in-
law is sacrosanct and the Jew and the fire-
insurance joke are virtually unknown, he
has since turned his publication into a
comic journal.

1 o-day, women songsters sing froi
nearly every tree in our land; and they a
o\ve something to Grace Elizabeth Jenninj
Carmichael. She was a pioneer in wha
was a bleak wilderness when she exploret
it; but, for pure joy, she wrote real Au
tralian verse with a simple melodiousnes
which few of the songsters of to-day ca
excel.
In the days when Jennings Carmichael

those brilliant writers of light verse who
like Harold Gray (“The Pilgrim”), deserv
to be redeemed from oblivion by an antho
logy of light verse; rhymes by W. S
Gilbert, much less brilliant, are fondly
remembered. These writers were expectec
to assist the Australasian as part of th
job; and Jennings Carmichael, even as
girb was welcomed amongst the coterie.

won her survival out of the moult
which has already covered those whose
names were greeted as brighter in her own
brief day. Societies interested in' art anc
literature in England have discovered hei

and, with considerable ceremony, a mem-

motto; and the Commomvealth had an

woman who was allowed to die so forgotten
23 years ago has been brought to honor
• Carmichael was born in Ballarat
m 18G7, but spent most of her
years in Gippsland. Her stepfather, Charles
Henderson, managed the Orbost station, on
the Snowy River, for William Clarke. Some
ot Clarkes guests at the station took an
interest in the 19-year-old girl who had
a heady made a small name by her verses
and she went to Melbourne as a companion
to a lady. Part of her intention was to get
away from a love affair with one with whom
marriage was impossible at the time. She
intended the separation to be permanent,
but later they came together again and'
marrying him, she became Mrs. Francis
IMullis. She qualified, after a long pro-
bation as a nurse; and most of her verses
about children came from her service in
the Children’s Hospital, Carlton.
Backed by influential friends, chief among
them the lady of William Clarke, she pub-
lished several books with fair results; but
Poems,’ the book which was republished
in England, contains the croam of licr work
There is enough in it to place her high
among Australian poets. The real admira-
tion for her must, however, be based upon
the fact that at the time when successful
Australian artists were still painting English
pictures in Australian settings, taking the
view that the real Australian atmosphere
would be inartistic, she put Australia into
verse.

The beautiful pastel colors that distinguish Dodge Brothers
new Four are decidedly a modern touch.
At a time when bright colours and attractive lines were never
more in demand, Dodge Brothers present this brilliant Four,
unequalled for smart appearance by any car of comparable price.
Steering is specially geared for balloon tyres. This feature,
together with the new, improved clutch and standard gear-
shift, accounts in large measure for the car’s unusual ease of
handling under all traffic conditions.
Because it exactly meets to-day’s motoring requirements, this
new Four is meeting the most enthusiastic reception ever
accorded a product by Dodge Brothers.

ago when her death was notified.
Usually, Jennings Carmichael showed
some of the adjectivalness which, in their
desire to be colorful, is the Australian
woman poet’s worst fault —the fault is
shared by male poets, too. But she had a
natural gift for melodic rhyme, and never
had to count out her scansion. That made
for pleasant reading; there was the whole-
souled enthusiasm, and the spiritual force
allied to it, which went the rest of the
distance.
HAROLD MERCER.
Punch and Judy
Enjoyment is conditioned by circum-
stance. The poem is enjoyed in solitude,
but not the prize fight. The painter and
sculptor express themselves to individuals;
the signwriter caters for the crowd. The
evangelist howls to the multitude; the
philosopher whispers to the individual. In
each there is a measure of enjoyment. But
when pleasure is taken collectively, its intel-
lectual content dwindles to the calibre of
the average brain.
It is thus illogical to consider the theatre
as anything other than a toy. Examined
critically, it is a puerile thing, a life-sized
doll’s house, a tinsel peepshow, pleasing to
the child mind. The popular long-run play
in which the favorite actress, adroitly
starred, advertises the art of her costu-
miere; the scortatory revue with its syn-
copated rhythms and sexual insouciance;
the musical comedy, the half-wit offspring
of comic opera; and the boudoir play
with its domestic platitudes passed off as
the absorbing problems of life and its
obstetrical insinuations brought to a happy
close at the final curtain —these form the
chief stock-in-trade of our commercial
theatres. These are the types of enter-
tainment meted out nightly by the thea-
trical managers with the take-it-or-
leave-it attitude of those wiho have a
monopoly. And the public bent on enjoy-
ment mostly takes it—or goes to the
cinema for sixpenn’orth of “cheer-up” by
the aid of a Los Angeles film idol.
The public is right. The theatre is its
emotional hot-house. To-night it goes in
search of a laugh; and to-morrow night it
patronises the show next door to surrender
to the delicious devices of the tear-
squeezers. It is the critics who are wrong
—those professional fault-finders and jour-
nalistic pall-bearers whose self-appointed
task appears to be the educating and up-
lifting of the masses. They approach the
stage with the expectations of a bride
approaching the altar, and then upbraid it
because of their disappointment. They
moan about the poor quality of the plays
and mouth large aspirations for a “higher”
drama—a “drama of ideas!” Anon, they
find the stage becoming a devil’s agent
damaging to the public morals.
Dramatic ideas are never more advanced
than those adumbrated in the average
newspaper editorial. They are of the
“twice two are four” variety, dressed in
arresting colors; and therefore liable to
deceive the auditors as brilliant specula-
tions. A play which is to command the
attention and approval of the mob must
offer a supremacy of sensation. The inter-
est must be near the surface; the charm
must not be hidden too obscurely beneath
the subtlety of epigram. Shakspeare, most
people will agree, was a peerless poet. As
a philosopher, however, he was common-
place. He spoke mob sentiments with a
golden tongue. The ideational content of
his plays is puerile; his witches and ghosts
and moving forests belong to the nursery.
His themes of revenge, jealousy, filial in-
gratitude, ambition are mob themes of uni-
versal interest. He preached no gospel;
but in sailing his dramatic fleet on the sea
of popular beliefs and sentiments he con-
quered the world. No one thinks of look-
ing for new ideas in Sheridan or for wisdom
in Wycherley. Moliere never sacrificed the
motley for the surplice. The worst of
Shaw’s plays are his sermons, and Jonson’s
“learned sock” is the very thing which
keeps him off the boards to-day.
Life is a cross between a prayer-meeting
and a circus; the sawdust and the hoops
are never far removed from the incense.
The average man is intrinsically childlike;
and the successful dramatist has but to
scratch through the veneer of his intellect
in order to appeal to the everlasting child
beneath. So the theatre is for him who,
growing up, has failed in his dreams and
must hire actors to do his dreaming for
him. Unable to go back to the nursery, he
goes to the theatre—the Punch and Judy
Show where the same old situations, the
clownings, the tears, the remorse and the
histrionics of love are paraded before him.
There, by a psychic regression, he slips
back into the make-believe of his nonage,
and plays with his rag dolls and his railway
stations and his lead soldiers, his unfulfilled
longings finding a brief attainment in the
mimic scenes which pass before him. He
escapes from the oppression of his adult
environment; and, like the child he was—
and, mentally, perhaps, still is—by project-
ing himself on to the characters he admires
or pities, he lives again in the glamor of
dream. He does not need to think; he
simply lets his mind drift away on the
wings of adventure. He climbs the bean-
stalk once again, becomes the fiery-eyed
giant-killer or the conquering Bluebeard.
Sylph-like damsels roll their bright eyes at
him or shake their pretty hips. Perchance
a callipygous queen may sing for him or
surrender her rouged lips. A beggar, he
may be wealthier than Midas; a curate, he
may own a seraglio. But for the nonce, he
is no longer the ineffectual bumble he was,
but a mad-wag and a hero. His ego has
lost its inadequacies; for here, in this
childish box of tricks, in the assumed dis-
guise of the players, behind the grease-
paint and beneath the wigs, there are
shown the emotions and struggles and
temptations which beset the generations of
man as they toil and straggle across the
ungarnished stage of life.
The greatest dramatists in all ages have
enriched this Punch and Judy Show —
not by presenting problems, but by re-
dressing platitudes; not by teasing the
mind with intellectual brilliance or subtle
dialectic, but by adding some tincture of
joy to the spectacle of life. They take
the theatre as they find it, content to
introduce new clowns, to rake up the saw-
dust for the performing elephant, to write
prettier speeches for Punch or shingle the
locks of Judy, in an endeavor to increase
the illusion of it all whereby the world
approaches the ideal. While dreams paint
in glowing colors the future of our lives
which reality later smudges with dis-
appointment or disaster, childhood must
ever remain our golden age; and whatever
buffoonery or pantomime opens for a time
those psychic gates to the realms of make-
believe, where all things are possible, or
pours balm on the wounds inflicted by
life’s ordinary slings and arrows, brings
joy to the thwarted ego and a measure of
happiness to the tired heart. The wisest
know how simple this is. They know what
comfort may be derived from the conven-
tional, what pleasure there is in the tickling
of a feather. It is only the aesthetic mal-
contents who, in the sounding name of
Art, want to vaccinate the lion-tamers,
convert the sword-swallowers to spiritu-
alism and turn the tent into a tabernacle.
REG. S. ELLERY.
Dramatic Criticism
Does mediocrity pervade any other art
in Australia as it does “dramatic criticism”?
I am referrihg mainly to the dailies; and,
after all, it is to the Monday morning’s
issue of his daily that the playgoer would
turn to learn of Saturday night’s 'premiere
if only there were an intelligent and infor-
mative resume for him to read. But do
half a dozen families remain in any city
who read Monday’s review and then decide
whether they will go to the new show or
stay away? Yet I imagine that in the years
gone by, when advertising had not been
brought to such a pitch, the papers’ notices
were the deciding factor with many hesitant
playgoers. Dramatic criticism is taken
more seriously in London and is still
capable of largely affecting the business of
a production. When C. B. Cochran staged
“Mayfair and Montmartre,” one of his
most ambitious revues at the Oxford, it
had a wonderfully enthusiastic first-night
reception from the audience; but, for some
reason or other, almost every critic damned
it, and although money was turned away
at the opening night business was no good
at all for the second performance.
It may be impossible to secure the per-
fect dramatic critic, for he must have not
only a knowledge of dramatic literature,
play construction and technique, but a
knowledge also of acting and production
along with an eye for color and beauty.
The former knowledge, I think, most of
our best critics have. If they haven’t, it
is their own fault, as it can be acquired by
study. But how many possess the other
attributes? Their scarcity explains why
most of the dailies devote three-quarters of
their notices to the story of the play, the
author’s other works and remarks in general,
and give but half a dozen lines to the
players and the acting. In some papers
half a column is devoted to the actresses’
costumes and the people present in the
audience; what the actresses did goes into
two or three lines.
Yet I don’t think actors make the best
critics; nor do I think the brilliant writer
is necessarily the brilliant critic. An in-
telligent, and educated theatre-lover is the
only justified critic—one who, in his youth,
has chosen to stand for an hour in a queue
waiting for a seat in the gods, and who,
when he strikes a really fine show, goes
four or five times to it. By such a critic
the man who gives a brilliant little sketch
of a two-line part will be singled out for
mention, instead of being “amongst others
who lent adequate support.” On the other
hand, if the show is a dud, the public will
be told so—if the critic can resist the prac-
tice of mild graft which prevails: the
thoroughly bad practice of inviting the
critics into the manager’s office in the in-
tervals for drinks and cigars, accompanied
by other little attentions.
There is one pitfall that very few critics
avoid'—the mistake of thinking that, the
player to whom the author gives the
brightest, wittiest lines is the one from
whom the best performance comes. Sup-
pose you are at a dull, poorly-written play,
with a lot of characters standing around,
talking explanatory stuff. A character
comes on for whom a splendid entrance
has been worked up and all the gems of
the dialogue saved. He gets the first
laughs. You will find that the critics will
hail his work as the outstanding perform-
ance of the night. “Things were rather
dull till Mr. X appeared, and by his com-
manding personality and sparkling cofmedy
galvanised the play into action,” and so on.
Yet his was probably the poorest piece of
work in the play; he may have done little
more than glibly recite his lines. The
critics are not the only ones deluded. The
audience is all with them.
Few Australian critics think it worth
while to notice the work of the producer—
the man who really makes or mars the
show. Sometimes, concerning an elaborate,
spectacular show, we read, “the production,
by Mr. So and So, was most effective.”
But of a play with the action set entirely
in one scene, say a farmhouse kitchen, no
mention would ever be made of the pro-
ducer, who probably had a far harder job
than his confrere did with the extrava-
ganza. The atmosphere, the lighting, the
incidental music, the costuming, the fur-
nishing, the whole conception of the inter-
pretation, the speed at which it shall be
played, and a hundred and one other
things, all rest with the producer. He
directs rehearsals, instructing each player
how to play his part. He is not merely a
designer of settings and color schemes. He
is often the “star.”
With the press more than with anyone
else lies a great power for that betterment
of the drama for which the papers some-
times sigh. There is no question that play-
going would increase if people could read
attractively written notices, telling them
what’s what, pointing out what is good and
condemning the rubbish. This would pro-
mote discussion, for almost every one who
goes to a show loves to dissect it after-
wards; and if we were helped through the
press to be more discerning, there could
be only one result, and that a very happy
one.

Novels Worth Reading
This list has been compiled by a com-
mittee of judges nominated by the Associ-
ated Booksellers of Australia and Maori-
land. It is issued, to serve as a reliable
guide to fiction of merit:—
Books of Literary Merit. —The Dusty
Answer, Rosamond Lehmann ; Three Wives,
by Beatrice Kean Seymour; Our Mr. Dor-
mer, by It. H. Mottram; Right Off the
Map, by C. E. Montague.
Books for Popular Reading.— The King-
dom of Theophilus, by W. J. Locke; Kitty,
by Warwick Deeping; The Joyous Conspira-
tor, by Geo. Gibbs; Captain Cavalier, by
Jackson Gregory; The Inn of the Hawk and
Raven, by G. li. McCutcbeon; Broken
Waters, by Prank L. Packard; The Worm,
by Desmond Coke; The Decoy, by J. D.
Beresford; The Green Shadow, by Herman
Landon ; An Unofficial Rose, by Mary Mar-
lowe ; Barberry Bush, by Kathleen Norris;

Sagusto, by Cecil Roberts.
A Satchel of Books
The Gospel of Sddhu Sundar Singh, by
Friedrich Heiler (Allen and Unwin). A
translation by Olive Wyon from the Ger-
man text. Sundar Singh is the son of a
wealthy and aristocratic Sikh family. In
early life his thoughts were, under the
influence of Iris mother, directed towards
religious matters, and he became converted
to Christianity, and this volume is interest-
ing as showing the effect of the assimilation
of the Clirist-idea by the Oriental mind.
The Hunted Piccaninnies, by W. M. Flem-
ing (Dent). This book, with its colored
and line illustrations by Kay Edmund, should
find a good market for the Christmas season.
It opens up fresh ground for boy readers
who love stories of adventure that take them
among primitive people. The story is cast in
days when the Australian abo. lived his
nomadic life trusting to what nature pro-
vided for sustenance: “they grew nothing,
they saved nothing, making no provision of
any sort against hard times.” Two white
boys, children of pioneer parents, lost them-
selves in the bush, and, when things were
seemingly at their worst, came upon three
abo. youngsters who had been given a day
and a night to escape from the camp of their
tribe and evade a capture that meant death.
The woodcraft and knowledge of beast and
bird and fish the white lads learned from
their black companions make up a book of
enthralling moments to youth and not with-
out interest to their elders. It should appeal
to readers overseas as strongly as to those
in the land of its birth.
♦
“C.M.” : In order to ensure at least pro-
duction expenses, Shaw Neilson’s new vol-
ume of poems is being offered to subscribers'
only. It should be in their hands in good
time for Christmas presentations. Box 711
G.P.0., Sydney, is where the necessary 3s.
3d. should be sent.
E. E. Pescott, Vic. Government pomolo-
gist and energetic president of the Field
Naturalists’ Club of Victoria, has published
a book on the “Native Flowers of Victoria”
that in its sphere bears comparison with
Leach’s Bird Book. He will shortly publish
another volume, this time dealing with the
fascinating but little known orchids of Vic-
toria —a task which was performed for S.
Australia some years ago by Dr. Rogers.
“Coot”: Most critics of Marcus Clarke
stress his bohemian habits and insinuate
that it was difficult to get work out of
him. But what is the man’s record? All
his literary output was crowded into 14
years. In that period he produced three
complete novels, more than 30 shorter tales,
a dozen or so dramatic works, a volume
of “Old Tales of a Young Country,” numer-
ous pamphlets on political and social affairs
and innnumerable contributions in prose
and verse to Australian and English papers
and magazines. In addition he was engaged
for a long time in routine journalistic
work, and for 10 years was an officer of the
Melbourne Public Library.

Rowe-street, Sydney.
Little lane that hides away
From the noisy traffic fray,
Here the spirit finds release
In a sanctuary of peace.
Half a footpath all it needs:
But that narrow pavement leads
To antiques and blossoms gay,
And —up many stairs —-the Flay !
Here a tiny torch is lit.
Can Australia shelter itV
Will an out-back Shakspeare come
To revive our drama dumb?
Here is set the simple scene,
Much as Shakspeare's must have been.
In this little lane is pent
Drama for a continent.

ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The Hills of Home.
Spring flings her bounty down the yellow
airs
Beneath the spacious realm of spreading
trees,
And all my heart is taken unawares
Prisoner of glamor, caught and held by
these
Coils of enchantment and the wistful snares
Of waking memories.
So I would turn again the rusted handles
Of time, to find the old things and the best;
Would watch the day put off her golden san-
dals
Above the dusty foothills’ furrowed crest,
While stars light up, like Benediction candles,
The altars of the west.
I would go back where youth’s long-vanished
hour is
And hearken to old melodies again,
ifike faint sea music in the shells of cowries;
Where ash and myrtle lift a leafy fane
Would see the scarlet flash of mountain
lowries
Like jewels in the rain.
The lute-player of the lazy wind goes sweep-
ing
With finger green and cool the gracious
trees,
Like a pale Peri at the gateway weeping,
A mermaid’s laughter under white-topped
seas;
With wind-blown bells of unnamed blossoms
keeping
ASolian harmonies.
Great cloud-shapes go like stately shadow-
ships
Slow sailing down a vast and leafy main .
Cool shall the wind’s kiss linger on my lips,
And I shall be, when day’s red fires shall
wane,
One with the spell the wide gold evening slips
O’er range and ridge and plain.
A spreading fan of pearl illuminating
The feathery fields of paling daffodil.
The little brown owl calls its note of mating.
The saplings shiver, but the ash stands
still;
And all the misty world of grey is waiting
The moon beyond the hill.
Ah. when the hours press heavy on the will,
So weary now, and beauty’s songs fall
dumb;
When the whole world grows wearisome and
chill,
Shall I not in my lonely dreaming come
To where the purple grape-bloom gathers still
Above the hills of home?

The Street.
In the street where I’m living now
Are laurels made green by spring—
Trim laurels with glossy leaves
Where birds of a morning sing.
When the mood takes one in hand,
’Tis pleasant to wander there,
With gardens on either side
That perfume the dustiess air.
For in front of every house.
Sun-nourished and nursed by showers,
There blooms a garden that tells
Where dwells a lover of flowers.
For a mile or, maybe, more,
’Twixt pavement and path green-grassed
The street ’neath leafage and limb
Winds on till it ends at last.
At its end is a little bay
As blue as the bending sky,
Where seagulls flutter and float.
And ships at their moorings lie.
At its end is a sandy beach
Where little ones plunge and play,
Free, free of care as the breeze
That wanders across the bay.
When the mood takes one in hand,
And one would be done with care,
’Tis well to stray to that sandy beach
And laugh witn the children there.
Thus the strpet where I’m living now.
With gardens on. either side,
Winds on. downhill, to an azure bay
Beloved of the wind and tide.

November at Browley, Moss Vale.
Couched in the tranquil bosom of the hills,
Orchard and hedgerow, homestead-barn and
byre
Bask in the glory of November noon.
The fragrant breath of clover and sweet-
briar
And buttercups that blossom where we tread,
Steeping the stilly air with honey sweet;
Below fair hawthorn aisles that skirt the
rim
Of golden liayfields drowsing in the heat.
A silver ribbon, threaded through the green
Of languid willows, trailing o’er the brink
Slim, idle fingers, glides tk-e whisperings
creek,
Where placid kine stoop leisurely to drink.
Afar the chime of mellow convent bells
Steals through the stillness, on the scented
air
Their hymn of faith breathes like a benison.
Do, Cod is peace and peace is every-
where !

Introspection.
I often wonder if, when you are dead,
I shall look back on these unhappy days,
And ask myself in sudden, shamed amaze
How many things I might have left unsaid—
This bitter sentence, that intended slight!
How often, when Hate burned,
I might have wisely turned
And cooled it patiently out in the night!
Will I an old intolerance bemoan
When you are dead, and I am left alone?
I vow repentance, then you speak again;
And ah! so cunningly you edge each dart!
So well you know each vulnerable part
That all too great becomes the rage and
pain.
So I, too, lift my bow,
Skilled archery to show,
And the whole sordid war begins again!
But still a desperate hope persists that we
Some kindness will bequeath to Memory!

Sirocco.
To-night there wakes a menace in the wind
Forbidding honest sleep. On nights as this,
'.lot, lustful nights, the angels must have
sinned!
The wind goes dryly, whispers like a kiss
Of hot betrayal; and the moon, aware
Of nakedness itself, has sought to bind
About her frailty clouds that leave her bare
Again in wanton treachery, inclined
By soft debauchment of that creeping wind.
Upon the air a madness wakes to-night.
The poppies know it, trembling petals pinned
Close, close about their heads. The birds
in flight
Anew it at sundown when the red day died.
They went in silence, mourning that bright
death,
Each feather apprehensive of the tide
Of steaithy-gaited wind, whose scalding
breath
Empties the world of all save ugly dreams
Blown rustling through the streets of list-
less Sleep,
Within whose suborned kingdom riot teems,
And in whose drowsy philtres poisons
steep,
Brewed by that arch malevolence the Wind
Who bawds unhindered till there runs the
word:
“The Dawn ! The Dawn ! Behold, the stars
are thinned!”
And breathing out a challenge, Day has
stirred,
Flinging her young defiance at the North.
Whitely she girds her loins, there wakes a
shout:
“Up, up, ye Southern Spears, and drive him
forth !”
And God in mercy sends His South Wind
out!

Bush Born.
I know a path meandering through the bush
Where vivid mats of pretty wild-flowers
grow
i Thick on each side, and massive silver sums
Cast deep and lacy shadow-shapes below.
I know a jungle, easy reached, where hang
| Bees’ nests, high up within toe spouts of
trees,
Where eucalyptus blossoms fill the air,
And greet us as we drink the limpid
breeze.
I know a hillside, white with new-shorn
sheep,
With flirting butterflies in rainbows drest;
I know where birds are mating, safely hid.
Above the nettles where the turkeys nest.
I know an old bush home where lights are
lit
To bravely show r a path across the floor ;
With creepers nailed about the old white
walls.
And honeysuckle ’round the kitchen door,
Where, tired, a man, full satisfied, will come
Whistling from out the curtains of the
night;
Glad for a baby’s laughing mouth to kiss,
For a woman’s welcome in the candle-light!

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1927.
BRUCE-PAGE UNDER FIRE.
The Bruce-Page combination is far from
being the ablest of the 15 Commonwealth
Ministries, though it will have lasted longer
than any other if it survives until March 9.
On the front bench in the House of Reps,
are men whose talents are respectable, but
the Prime Minister is no orator as Deakin
was, the Treasurer is no Turner and the
Customs Minister is no Kingston. And
among the lesser Ministers there are plain
duds. The Government began by preaching
economy, but practised it only in the De-
fence Department, with serious results to
the Army, while undertaking to find
£20.000,000 for State road-construction,
which is not the Commonwealth’s business.
It rushed into a campaign for the enlarge-
ment of the Commonwealth’s powers, but
bungled it so badly that the proposals were
defeated, though with proper preparation
and instruction of the electors they could
have been carried. It thrust Judge Beeby
on the wage-paying section and is flirting
with proposals for other burdens, such as
child endowment and national insurance;
but it has been tardy in coming to the
rescue of industries threatened with destruc-
tion by the rising tide of imports. And its
habit of disposing of awkward questions by
referring them to royal commissions has
ceased to be amusing.
The Government, in short, is very vul-
nerable, and it has foes in its own camp as
well as that of the avowed enemy. Yet all
their forays, which are becoming more fre-
quent, leave it unharmed. Every attack,
indeed, strengthens the popular impression
that, although the Brages are nothing to
write home about, Australia could go far-
ther and fare worse. The assailants of the
Administration are a queer lot, and some of
them are egregiously clumsy. Westralian
Freetraders, for instance, keep up the silly
cry that their State is a groaning victim of
“Federal oppression,” particularly on the
fiscal side, in spite of the clearest evidence
that it is thriving on its alleged wrongs.
It is, in fact, the most flourishing portion
of the Commonwealth—since the Braces
came along with their “ruinous tariff” the
wheat yield has shot up from 14,000,000
bushels to an estimated 35,000,000 —and
thanks partly to unnecessarily lavish
Federal grants, the State taxation is very
much lighter than it is in N. S. Wales,
Queensland or S. Aus. Another persistent
sniper is Stewart, M.H.R. for Wimmera,
who stands for Freetrade in most things
and High Protection on every article pro-
duced in his own constituency. Stewart was
in the Ministry for a few months, and has
never got over the shock of the discovery
that it could manage without him. Then
there is W. M. Hughes, who, by way of
feeding an old grudge, has been denouncing
the Prime Minister for proposing to sell the
bankrupt and job-controlled Government
steamers and the Treasurer for his “wild
and reckless extravagance, the like of which
this country has never previously known.”
One indictment gave rise to speculations as
to whether the Labor-Socialist who turned
Nationalist was going to twist again; the
other stirred up memories of the prodigal
days of his dictatorship, and made men
laugh.
* * H: $
The Prime Minister is at his best when
the Government is under fire. His speech
in defence of Page and his financial record
was far and away the most effective contri-
bution to the Budget debate. With all its
faults, his Administration does not deserve
to be rejected in favor of one composed of
the present rabble of malcontents, or one
formed out of the queer party which is tom
between Australianism and internationalism
—which is in two (or more) minds on
such questions as the exclusion of
immigrants, the scrapping of the defences,
the tariff, overseas borrowing, extension of
Commonwealth powers and the abolition
of the Senate. But Bruce and Page could
drop three of the present Ministers with
advantage. Moreover, they should give less
attention to vote-catching schemes like
national insurance, the Federal-aid roads
and the Federal homes, and more—a great
deal more—to the adverse trade balance,
the citizen army and taxation reform—
which last could be effected by making the
income-tax a Commonwealth matter exclu-
sively and transferring the taxation of land,
entertainments and dead men’s property to
the States.
GOOD ROADS OR SANE RAILWAYS?
The other day the N.M.R.A. held a Good
Roads Conference, and those present
worked off some great thoughts, such as:—
“Stop building railways. If I had my way
I would sell all the railway lines and build
good roads. The time is not far distant
when the larger amount of goods and the
greater proportion of population will be
transported, not over our railway lines but
over our roads.... Economic progress de-
mands that we give the people the cheapest
means of getting their produce to market.”
And more to the same effect. Unfortu-
nately it didn’t lead anywhere in particular.
For instance, the gentleman who wanted
to sell the railways didn’t suggest how much
in the £ they would fetch if offered as an
obsolete concern which the owners were
getting rid of with the avowed intention of
promoting road competition.
It may' be accepted as a dull fact that
economic progress does demand “the cheap-
est means of getting produce to market.”
In this matter the railways fall a long way
short of perfection. One reason is the crazy-
breaks of gauge. They entail a dreadful
waste of time and money in unloading and
reloading. They involve the use of much
superfluous rolling stock, and much of this
may be lying idle in one State when there
is work for it to do in another. In short
they reduce efficiency to a minimum.
Therefore Australia should absolutely cease
from building w'rong-gauge railways and get
to work on the unification problem, and
not stop by day or night till it is finished.
A second cause of ill-success is that so many
of the lines lead, not to the nearest port,
but to the one furthest away. A third cause
is the lack of small industrial towns to help
in supplying cheaply accessible markets.
A fourth trouble lies in the interest bill,
which calls for charges from 30 to 50 per
cent, higher than should be necessary. Sys-
tematic repayment of the debt is the
remedy for this. A fifth obstacle is the
lamentable court presided over by Deth-
ridge, Beeby and Lukin. Nothing that the
Good Roads enthusiasts suggest would help
these five disadvantages or make the 300
millions invested in railways any more pro-
fitable.
*
If roads were built wholly out of loans
the same as railways, and if railways w*ere
built largely out of revenue the same as
roads, and if road travellers, including road
hogs, were called on to pay the full cost of
maintenance as railway travellers are, the
position would be different. It is somewhat
different in any case. At the end of 1920
N.S.W. alone had 153,085 motor vehicles
in commission,-an increase of 134,589 in 11
years. Making allowance for replacement
of worn-out Lizzies, the purchases must
have been enormously in excess of 134,589.
The State railways get along with 27,637
vehicles all told. The motor service also
differs from the-railways inasmuch as the
rolling stock is mostly imported and the fuel
almost entirely so. In 1925-26 Australia
paid to people abroad over 24 j million
pounds under these headings. In the same
year it paid about 35 millions for the whole
Commonwealth railway service, but that
included the maintenance of the road or
permanent way and the wages of the men
who drove the vehicles, which the motor
items certainly didn’t. Incidentally, the
railway money stayed here. Further, if
the railways of N.S.W. were superseded
and 200,000 motor vehicles turned out to do
their work, for which they would prove
wholly insufficient, it would take one-sixth
of the adult population to drive them, or
one-third if the driver and his wife or future
wife are reckoned as one. And a large pro-
portion of these would be employed carry-
ing petrol into the interior to keep the fuss
going. The fact that it requires the same
man-power to drive a fathom or tw r o of car
as a quarter-mile of train is a disturbing
element. By comparison the problem of
adequate sleeping accommodation on
motors is a minor affair.
* S: * *
Taking everything into account it may be
that the railway isn’t a doomed institution,
after all.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Visitor from Downing-street.
Dominions Secretary' Amery’s whirlwind
tour of Australia has had two good results.
It has led Australians to look at their
country, if only for a little while, as a part
of a bigger organisation, and, judging by
his later speeches, it has convinced Mr.
Amery that certain views long cherished in
Downing-street concerning the best means
of populating oversea Dominions are no
longer sound. The notion that thousands
of pallid slum people can be shipped to
these shores every year and automatically'
turned into bronzed and bearded and pros-
perous farmers who will buy the manufac-
tures of the Old Land—and that has been
both the Conservative and Liberal migra-
tion policy' in Britain for over a century—
simply' will not work; and though his visit
has been a hurried one, Mr. Amery is too
observant to have missed the point. Indeed
in one of his Sydney speeches he said:—
“Immigration is not so simple a business
as is sometimes supposed. There can be no
question of dumping a vast mass of people at
your door and assuming that somehow or
other they will make good. It is a question
of finding the right type of man, and of
assisting him across the ocean; of giving
him the kind of reception that will make
him feel at home when he lands, and then
of seeing that he gets straight into some
occupation where he can directly take part
in the productive work of the country.”
Mr. Amery must have been struck,
though his utterances gave no sign of it,
w'ith the very evident determination of
Australians to obtain for themselves a
greater share of their own market. Signifi-
cant in this connection was his insistence on
John Bull’s readiness to lend Australia
money. There are two ways in which John
can provide Australia with money—by'
loans to Governments for public works (and
to pay their interest bills), and by private
investments in Australian industry. The
first method is encouraged as a fundamental
of British statescraft, because it means the
employment here of hundreds of thousands
of day-laborers who otherwise might be
engaged in more skilled industry, and be-
cause it ensures that Australia will import
John’s manufactures in tremendous quan-
tities. The second method is neither encour-
aged nor discouraged; but it will never re-
place the Government-loan system, with all
its defects and dangers, until Australian
manufacturing policy has been much further
developed. Mr. Amery is probably very
well aware of that, and equally well aware
that the Dominions’ view of migration—so
far as Australia and Canada are concerned,
at any rate —is that it would be a good
thing if John Bull sent them some of his
skilled workers and put far more of his
own population to the task of food pro-
duction.
That sort of redistribution of Empire
population never was popular with
British statesmen. But they will have
to accommodate themselves to the chang-
ing circumstances. In particular they will
have to realise that the Dominions were
not made for their convenience. Mr. Amery
appealed to us for closer co-operation; and
before his departure for Maoriland he had
tangible evidence of . our sympathy in a
tariff revision intended to help certain
British manufacturers to fight American
competition in this market. Close co-opera-
tion, however, cannot be brought about by
Governments as timorous regarding protec-
tive duties and preferences as Britain’s. The
Empire quite possibly could be organised
on a self-contained trading basis, but it
»an’t be done while Britain worships at the
shrine of Cobden.
$
Expensive Monopolies.
The days when nearly everyone had a
strong feeling for unionism are rapidly
passing, not because the ideal has ceased
to be a fine one—it is as fine as ever it was
—but because of the ruinous use which
unions reinforced by unwise industrial laws
are making of powers it was never intended
they should possess. A striking instance is
the “overtime strike,” declared by the
Waterside Workers’ Federation —now an
annual outrage, apparently.
The claim that none but unionists
shall be employed is a perfectly good one
—on certain conditions. If the union
undertakes that it will submit all disputes
to some form of peaceful settlement—-if,
in short, it pledges itself to keep the
wheels of industry going without a stop—
then the community is entitled to say
“Very well. We will give preference to
unionists, because, whereas unionists can
give guarantees of industrial peace, non-
unionists obviously cannot.” But if the
union not only does not give any such
guarantees of peace, but on the contrary
promotes disaffection and disturbance, then
the community which does not resist the
claim for preference must be too simple to
take care of itself. In this case the union
is a notorious disturber. For years past
its arrogant behavior, from Fremantle to
Darwin, has caused dislocation of freight
transfers, while many thousands of pounds
have been lost by perfectly inoffensive
shippers, such being in most instances the
union’s amiable intention. A long period
of deregistration after the wartime strike
in 1917, and the establishment of the
“loyalist” union in Sydney, did much to
clip the claws of the Federation. Re-
registered as a result of a safety-first com-
promise by Stanley Bruce, and heartened
by the obliteration of the rival union in
N.S.W.—thanks to Good Old Piddo —the
union has again taken up its congenial job
of making trouble on the slightest pretext.
The question arises whether its main-
tenance and support in its unprofitable
monopoly is worth while, and whether the
well-intended laws that bolster such soci-
ally dangerous organisations are not ripe
for wiping out.

Why We Have so Many Agitators.
How is it that Australia possesses so many
industrial agitators of the vitriolic type?
During the past 15 years Labor has had a
very large say in making the nation’s laws.
Our solicitude for the toiler is great, and
we lead the world in humanitarian legisla-
tion (so called). Unskilled labor is better
paid here than anywhere else in the world.
In such circumstances one would expect
Australia to provide a barren field for the
industrial agitator. But it doesn’t. At the
very moment when the ill-paid English
toiler was repudiating Moscow and all its
works, the Australian toiler reached the
Reddest chapter in his history. Recent
happenings in Queensland and the heavy
vote cast for Lang and his Communist
cobbers in the recent N.S.W. elections
prove this conclusively.
Seeking an explanation, some grains may
be gleaned if we consider the status of the
skilled worker. Comparatively speaking,
our skilled workers are not adequately paid.
There is little inducement for the sons of
toilers to equip themselves for skilled work
while such an insufficient margin exists be-
tween skilled and unskilled labor. The
consequence is that hundreds of highlv-
intelligent youths, whom nature has fitted
for better things, drift into the overcrowded
ranks of the unskilled toilers. Here there
is no future for them save as industrial
agitators, and, in consequence, our crop of
industrial agitators is a marvel.
It might be objected that there would be
no agitators were there not first a wide-
spread discontent amongst the toilers; but
it is actually the agitators who excite the
discontent so that they may profit politi-
cally by it. The fact that conditions for
unskilled labor in Australia are ideal is
beside the point. It is easy to become dis-
contented with the most perfect conditions,
provided the right kind of propaganda is
used. The amount of discontent. in any
branch of service has no relationship what-
ever to the number of genuine grievances
existing in that service.
Denied adequate expression in the econo-
mic sphere, these men seek it in the political
sphere. That they have no deep-rooted
hatred for capitalism is indicated by the
maimer in which they hasten to become
capitalists—is indicated, moreover, by the
manner in which they discriminate between
the capitalist who is an employer of labor
and the capitalist who does not employ


labor. The former must be always de-
nounced, because lie is the boss of indivi-
duals who are politically valuable to the
agitators; the latter may be sometimes
applauded, particularly if he happens to
employ racing ponies or tin hares, or is the
patron of imported pugs.

The World’s Most Futile Court.
One of the things which any court of juris-
diction finds it necessary to have about the
house is a set of sharp teeth with which to
bite contemptuous and contumelious indi-
viduals Avho defy its authority. Unfor-
tunately the Federal Arbitration Court, in
common with the State tribunals and Good
Old Piddo, has never been thus equipped.
It is supposed to have some teeth, but
either they don’t fit or have been mislaid or
they can only be used on the 29th of Febru-
ary. The Federal Arbitration Court, which
has to deal with sailors and stokers and
wharfies and other gents who have a rococo
taste in union leaders, has occasion to gnash
its toothless gums rather more often than
the lesser courts of the kind. It is now having
its periodical bout of face-gymnastics with
the blokes who load and unload ships. They
are by no means toothless. They can at an
hour’s notice put a full stop to the pro-
cesses of oversea or inter-State trade or
both, and they have noticed that whenever
they do threaten to do so it puts both the
Federal Arbitration Court and the ship-
owners into a most conciliatory and appre-
hensive frame of mind.
Under such threats the Court has re-
cently granted the wharf-lumpers an interim
award, raising the overtime rate. But that
wasn’t enough, and the shipowners, still
under threats, have had to try to patch up
the quarrel without the Court’s assistance.
But love’s labor has been lost, and the
Avharfies’ federation is getting a well-prac-
tised thumb ready. It will be pointed
downward at ships trading with oversea
ports, and this and that and the other liner
will be declared black and tied up to the
AA’harf until somebody gets tired of the
merry game. All the Federal Arbitration
Court has been able to do about it is to say
that it is deeply shocked and that it won’t
make another award until there is some
reasonable guarantee that the wharfies will
regard awards as something more than an
excellent jest. But it has said that a great
many times already, and the repetition
doesn’t arouse the faintest emotion in any
human breast.
Whether the Court has itself or its
makers to blame for its futility is a matter
for argument, but down somewhere near
the root of the matter is the tribunal’s
Aveakness for accepting specious alibis. It
is only necessary, apparently, for the
executive of a federation of unions to
declare that it ran’t control its members,
and that is the end of the matter so far as
the Court is concerned. As a matter of
commonsense, putting law aside altogether,
officials vested with executive authority
who confess that they haven’t any autho-
rity ought to be removable from office
immediately by the tribunal before which
they appear, on the ground that they are
duds and dodderers and a nuisance to them-
sehres and the people who misguidedly
elected them. Either that, or the LaAV
should assume and the assumption
Avouldn’t shock anyone—that the officials
do control the membership of the federation
and that their liberty and the federation
funds should be regarded as convenient
hostages. Someone has. to organise a strike,
and it isn’t putting too much of a strain
on probabilities to take it for granted that
the officers of a union or federation, who
have all the strings in their hands, must
haxrn pulled some. If there is any future
for industrial arbitration it must rest on
an agreement that miracles don’t happen,
that unions of employees are neither
manned nor officered by irresponsible'imbe-
ciles, and that courts of arbitration really
are courts and have the police, the army,
the navy and the air force behind them.
Any court that, can’t command all the
resources of the Government to enforce
its decrees is about as useful and dignified
as. a one-armed paperhanger suffering from
the itch.
♦
Which Shall We Choose?
The loan boom will go ahead for a while
yet, the money-lenders permitting. The
S. M. Herald lately stated the case, but
without suggesting a remedy:—
“The custom is to raise abroad an amount
equal to interest payments, plus purchases
made abroad and payment for services ren-
dered and payable abroad. The amount
which is raised abroad thus increases annu-
ally by at least a sum equal to the interest
on the net amount raised abroad in the
preceding year.”
That is a clear statement so far as it goes.
Unless there is a complete readjustment of
Australia’s slipshod plan of existence it
must borroAV abroad each year some more
than it did the year previously, so long as
it can get the money. Signs of violent
pressure are plentiful enough. Victoria has
raised £4,000,000 of gold or its equivalent
in London and left it there to meet bills.
Westralia is arranging, through the kind
offices of the British Government, for
£5,000.000, which won’t leave England.
N.S.WL has spent all the money it had in
London, and has a neAV overdraft there
which approaches £4,000,000 and shouts
loudly to be paid off with loan funds. The
city of Sydney has floated a two-million-
pound transaction in England with diffi-
culty, and wants to do another similar deal.
No conspicuous dishonesty or obvious fraud
attached to these doings. They merely
represented present incapacity and past
imbecility.
A pressing conclusion is that this great
continent should cease from laboriously
wasting its men and women and concen-
trate on finding them profitable occupation.
There is no reason why they shouldn’t go
on the land in a natural way if they want
to, and to that end we might encourage
very big landowners, with some gratis sort
of encouragement, to subdivide. Also,
when the completion of the South-to-North
raihvay makes the N. Territory accessible,
blocks should be made available along
the line for promising persons on a few
simple conditions. But the formal methods
of “putting” inhabitants on “farms” which
are not farms at all are unsatisfactory and
quite beyond the community’s present
means. To quote an instance, the officially
estimated value of all the Commonwealth’s
crops was nearly 14 million pounds more
in 1925-26 than in 1915-16, both fairly
good years, the rise being from 75 to 89
millions. But in the same period the annual
interest on the States’ debts (purely peace
debts) increased by almost 18 millions, and
most of the enormous new liability was
incurred for the nominal purpose of “open-
ing up the country” in some way. So the
apparent gain was really a great loss.
Again, in the same period the number of
persons employed in every kind of on-the-
land industry decreased, by the official
estimate, from 451,909 to 432,134. The land
might have done better if it had been
left alone.
Production has collapsed so badly that
during the last five years all the surplus
products which Australia had for export
were £53,000,000 short of paying for im-
ports alone, and provided nothing for inter-
est, which was added bodily to the aggre-
gate debt. During the five-years period
just before the war, and before the uproari-
ous loan-“settlement” boom, exports paid
for imports and supplied £56,000,000 over
towards meeting other liabilities. The
astounding reversal of form in recent years
seems to show that this country has been
backing the wrong horse. A stoppage of
“settlement” and “development” schemes is
at least due until some person or persons
can discover what is wrong with them and
how to put it right. Meantime the nation
might concentrate with more intensity on
manufacturing. As far as this paper knows
Holden’s, Metters’, Ruwolt’s and Meg-
gitt’s factories combined haven’t added one
penny to the public debt. You can’t say
as much for any half-dozen farms occupied
by assisted settlers in the past dozen years.

Should the G.P. Do His Own Surgery?
Dear Bulletin, —If there is one thing which
can make a surgeon howl with rage, it is
the thought that a country or suburban
practitioner should have the audacity to do
his own surgety. “Quack” (B. 17/11/’27),
in an otherwise eminently sane and sensible
article, cannot resist a tilt at such prac-
titioners, and adds a pious prayer to God to
forgive them.
But the fact remains that many general
practitioners are doing their own surgery
and doing it very well. They recognise
(and the public is beginning to recognise)
that surgery is very much over-rated and
very much over-paid. People are beginning
to reason: “Why should I go to a specialist
in the city and pay a huge fee to have my
appendix removed when I can have it done
quite well by my own doctor at Quart
Pot?” They are right; the “city surgeon”
is oppressing us like a fetich. Cases first
seen by a general practitioner frequently go
to a physician for a second opinion, the
X-ray man or the pathologist confirms the
diagnosis, and the surgeon does the least
intellectual part of the work—the operation.
But he gets the largest fee and all the
credit.
Anyway, how many surgeons can look
back on their early days and say truthfully
that they did not commence their careers
bv “doing their own surgery”? It is only
later in their careers, when they have made
their names (and fortunes), that they talk
as though the art of surgery was something
supernatural. Certainly there are cases
which no one but a specialist should
attempt; but there is no reason why the
well-trained general practitioner should not
do—and do well—the more common opera-
tions of surgery. And he usually does do
them well.
The horrified nrotest of the surgeons
would be easier to listen to if they were
not so financially interested.—Yours, etc..
Another Quack.

The Fillutn Commission.
From the report of the Daily Bugle:—
At the opening of the 17,539 th sitting of the
Commonwealth Film Commission the Chairman inti-
mated that he had received a letter from a gentleman
owning an oyster-lease at AVoy Woy who was pre-
pared to give evidence. The gentleman stated that
he had been unable to visit Sydney for 10 years,
but was prepared to make the trip about Christmas
if his expenses could be arranged.
Mr. Wagjaw, K.C., representing sundry big dis-
tributors, said that his clients desired to reiterate
their wish to bring the proceedings of the Commis-
sion to a termination. At the same time he sub-
mitted that the evidence of this gentleman might be
valuable. Film-actors undoubtedly ate oysters,
especially if anyone else paid for them. Film
distributors also ate oysters. It was thus obvious
that the owner of an oyster-lease could supply infor-
mation bearing oil the value of the film business to
other industries.
It was decided to invite the attendance of the
writer, arrangements being made for the payment of
his expenses.
Mr. Blither, who had been absent several
times when called by the Commission, apologised
and explained the reason. His absence on the first
occasion was caused by his marriage. On the
second occasion he had been obliged to go to Bris-
bane to attend the marriage of his daughter. Unfor-
tunately the sad death by drowning of his grandson,
a bright schoolboy, had interfered with his attend-
ance on the third occasion.
The witness said that he had never had any
association with film enterprises. He was au account-
ant. As a financial expert he gave the opinion that,
properly financed and well managed, there was a
good chance of Australian films being successful,
especially if they were given a subsidy. His opinion
of Australian sunlight was that it was good for the
health. There were actors in Australia; he had
lent money to them. He did not know whether they
were good actors. He only met them in bars, and
understood that when they wanted to go on the
stage they went to America and England.
Mr. Bouncer admitted that he was an Australian,
but said that he had gone to America to be edu-
cated. It was impossible for Australians to make
films unless they went to America to be educated.
The large proportion of Australians who had made
successes on the American stage was due to the fact
that they had gone to America. Australian women
lacked the beauty necessary for the screen and were
very crude. It took them some time to learn to
chew gum and to give the right sound to such
words as “dahlars.” Until they were able to do
these things they were unable to create the right
screen atmosphere. Australian men had not learnt
to dress properly. He himself had not known how
to dress until he went to America.
The remainder of the morning session was devoted
by the members to an inspection of Mr. Bouncer’s
wardrobe.
On resuming in the afternoon, the Chairman (Mr.
Arks) said the information supplied by Mr. Bouncer
had profoundly impressed him. Seeing how they
needed to dress, it was no wonder that screen
artists required large salaries. If the Commission
followed this up it might discover that it would be
much cheaper to let America make films for Australia.
Mr. AVagjaw, K.C., said that, much as his clients
desired to promote Australian industry, they believed
that this argument was unanswerable.
Mr. Moneybags, managing director of the Univer-
sal Golden Love Film Corporation, said that at con-
siderable expense his firm had imported an American
woman writer in an endeavor to obtain screen
stories. There were no writers in Australia; in any
case they would not know how to write about Aus-
tralia.
A member of the Commission: Was she a well-
known writer ?
Mr. Moneybags: She was from America.
The Chairman: That ought to be good enough for
us.
The witness warmly resented any slurs being cast
upon a lady and a visitor to this country. The
lady’s father had been a very well-known vendor of
tripe in New York. He had sold onions with it.
That would give an hereditary bearing towards writ-
ing for the American fillums. A knowledge of tripe
alone would not do ; a study of onions was essential.
In reply 'to a question he said he did not think it
likely that any tnpe-and-onion vendors in Australia
had daughters. In any case the tripe and onions
would not be as good as the American tripe and
onions.
The lady, witness continued, had fainted after her
first look at Sydney. She was amazed to discover
that drovers and other bush workers did not dress
like the cowboys who work for the American films.
She had gone away declaring that it was impossible
to write any story suitable for the film about such
a country.
Prior to the conclusion of the sitting the Chair-
man announced that the Commission had been invited
to a private view of the latest great American pro-
duction, “Fancy Florrie’s Frivolities.” Its attend-
ance at this show would be regarded as a sitting.

Willis in the N.S.W. Council.
No sooner had the N.S.W. Parliament been
called together than the 38 members of
the Leg. Council ranking as Laborites met
to elect a leader. Willis, the Lang-
appointed general, at once scented trouble,
and it was industriously given out that the
right of selecting a leader rested with the
Assembly caucusmen alone. Knowing the
fate of good Laborites like Dooley, Mc-
Tiernan, Cann and others, he no doubt
felt secure if he could work the change of
venue; but the Council Laborites would
not be denied their right to elect their
own leader, and Simon Hickey, an ex-
Speaker. nominated J. F. Coates against
him.
No sooner had the nominations been
announced than seven or eight of the known
anti-Willisites were summoned before the
A.L.P. Executive to “show cause” on some
pretext or other. Next, the pending ballot
was declared null and void. Still the ballot
was persisted in, and Coates was found to
have a solid majority, Willis getting few
votes —less than one for every year he has
been in the country, in fact.
Ordinarily a man thus beaten would stand
back; but not Willis, Later, in the House,
he rose simultaneously with Coates, there-
by under “precedent” claiming the right to
speak first—and got it! He also got the
disgust of even the Tory section of the
House, which, all through the years, what-
ever else may be said, has maintained some
regard for decency in conduct, Coates
when he did get a say likened Willis to
another boy he played cricket with who
was never “out”—he owned the bat.
All this arises through the practice that
has long ruled in both branches of the Legis-
lature, and is now venerated by the name of
“precedent,” whereby the Speaker or Presi-
dent lets ex-Ministers or ex-Speakers catch
his eye before ordinary members. Neither
May’s Parliamentary Procedure nor our
own Standing Orders founded thereon lay
down any rule on the matter, so that this
pre-audience idea is poorly based. On the
Assembly side, for obvious Party reasons,
when a member is selected as leader or
deputy-leader the distinction immediately
insures him the right of pre-audience. It is
understood that the reason why President
Fred Flowers gave the call to Willis was
that he considered the Upper House was
non-party and the before-mentioned rule
did not apply. If Flowers does not know
that the Legislative Council has long since
become “party” he is the only one that
doesn’t.
In the meantime Willis’s butting in
under privilege is without parallel, and
shows how hard it is to shift some men
once they get their feet under your table. •

Life and Death in the Solomons.
News was received from Malaita, in the
Solomons, last week that the native mur-
derers of District Commissioner Bell and
his assistant, Lillies, had been captured,
together with their chief and ringleader,
Basiane. Apart from its somewhat
hysterical behavior at the beginning, when
it borrowed an Australian cruiser and
mobilised a force of white volunteers, the
Colonial Office, which controls the Solo-
mons, may be congratulated on the speedy
and successful re-establishment of its
shaken prestige among the natives. In a
calmer frame of mind it dismissed its white
volunteers, sent back the warship with
thanks, and went about the business with
its own officials and native police.
The Colonial Office, having thus set
its hand to the plough, should carry
on with the work. By which is meant, not
the waging of warfare with the natives,
but the continuous and peaceful penetra-
tion of their country, till they come to
recognise that the white Government really
means to be the big Government in the
whole place, and not merely to sit down on
the beaches and make an occasional angry
and usually futile dash into the interior.
Comparisons are odious, but among those
accustomed to Papua’s control of its native
peoples it is hard to avoid a smile when
they read of the bushmen coming to the
beach to trade in full fighting kit, and
withdrawing again to their mountain fast-
nesses after a desultory murder or two.
Papua stopped that a generation ago. The
Colonial Office started to do it the other
day, perhaps without realising what a de-
parture it had made from its old routine.
Many other islands of the group are in
much the same state as Malaita, untouched
by Government influence save for their
fringes. The time has come to change that.
There are two brakes on the Colonial
Office wheel. One is its notorious par-
simony in the matter of maintaining
adequate administrative staffs. The other is
its obsession for excluding all white men
save the official and the missionary from
territories inhabited by primitive peoples,
if it can be done by hook or crook. It is
notorious that for years the Colonial Office
has dreaded the discovery of rich gold in
the Solomons, though the metal is known
to exist on Guadalcanar and other islands.
The spirit of the C.O. official in the Papua
of long ago, who openly wished gold had
never been discovered there, since it had
led many of his fellow Britons to enter the
country, still lives. A good deal of it
lies behind the failure of the C.O. to open
up the interior of the islands under its
control, and bring their inhabitants to some
appreciation of the pax Brilannica. The
ball has, however, been started, and even
the inertia of the authorities will prob-
ably prove powerless to prevent it rolling.

In spite of the Jeremiahs who continually
lament, Britain’s shortcomings in the
matter of commercial aviation, the annual
report of Imperial Airways suggests that, in
spite of the limitations imposed by her
geographical position, Britain is holding
her end well up. Imperial Airways carried
16,700 passengers for the year ending
March 31, and this on the only two routes
on which it seems worth while for the
Briton to engage, the Paris and Brussels
services. Much is made by the ’Miahs of
the fact that Germany’s services carried
56.000 passengers. But Germany lies in
the centre of western Europe, with practic-
able routes radiating in all directions. And
its area makes services payable within its
own borders. There is the question of
subsidies, too. Britain pays Imperial Air-
ways £137,000 annually. Germany gives its
lines £776,000. That is to say, with 5|
times the Government subsidy, Germany
carries only a little more than 31- times
the number of passengers transported by
Imperial Airwavs.

“Crystalographer” : Frank Tate, Vic.’s
Education Director, just home from the
Imperial Education Conference, has made
two discoveries; one of them, that Vic-
toria needs more Junior Technical Schools.
It, is to be hoped he has taken note of the
details of the organisation of such schools.
Since the establishment of the first of them
in the southern State, 15 years ago, several
factors have checked their development.
The following have all been important:—
(1) The placing of tlie organisation of
the schools in the hands of craftsmen rather
than organisers or teachers. Excellent
tradesmen often fail when required to
control men and youths.
(2) The failure of the department to gain
the confidence of teachers employed in this
section. That bad blood still exists is
shown by the recent statement of the head
of the branch (an engineering expert) that
people trained as teachers are usually in-
capable of organising a school.
(3) From the beginning an attempt has
been made to build the structure of advanced
technical work on the foundation of a weak
general education.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Things are turning out at Canberra
exactly as The Bulletin forcasted. Mem-
bers, like tlie rest, not having enough to do,
have already fallen into the same condition
as a ship’s company after three iveeks at
sea. There is going to be more backbiting
and intriguing at Canberra in a month than
Melbourne knew in a year.
Under the amended tariff presented to the
Reps, last week duties are increased on
British goods under 19 headings, and are
increased on non-British goods under 42
headings. There are reductions under 24
headings for British goods, and of these nine
apply to British goods only. So in 28 cate-
gories the British preference has been in-
creased, and it is reckoned that Australia will
now sacrifice £10,000,000 per annum in duties
instead of £8,500,000 for the benefit of J.
Bull’s industry. But the nominal loss is of
minor importance, for by reason of the ‘large
mass of imports the Commonwealth has an
abundance of Customs revenue. Unfortu-
nately it is in paper money. Therefore it
avails not either to reduce external debts or
to pay interest on external debts.
Amid all the care for British manufactures
it seems as if some Australian manufactures
are still neglected. Among other compli-
cations, the United Kingdom imports large
quantities of iron and steel, and goods made
out of them. It also exports large quan-
tities ; and the Commonwealth’s imports
in “Class XII, Metals and Machinery,”
have moved from £35,203,294 in 1922-23
to £51,237,944 in 1926-27. The industry Is
in a poor way, which might also be said
of the textile business and others, and the
new tariff isn’t a sufficiently vigorous effort
to repair the situation.
The finish of Sydney Municipal Council
was singularly uneventful. When the bill
for its abolition was before the Upper House
some Labor nominees stayed away and some
voted for abolition. And such a pitiful hand-
ful turned up to Lud Mayor Mostyn’s meet-
ing of protest that it was given up. His
Ludship gave two explanations. It was late-
sliopping night, so people were out busy shop-
ping in the rain; and it was a wet night,
so people didn’t come out at all.
Though a few made a pretence of being
indignant, the opposition to the ejection of
A. I). Kay from the Meat Board was the
feeblest that the N.S.W. Bavin Government
has encountered since it met Parliament.
The Langites insisted on the customary
routine of valueless and monotonous divi-
sions, but exhibited none of the savagery
that had caused Speaker Levy to lose control
of his menagerie when the Sydney City
Council was getting its deserts. Even a bill
authorising the removal of half a dozen tomb-
stones and remains from a suburban cemetery
was treated more seriously.
According to Works Minister Jones, the
Vic. public service harbors numerous gentle-
men who believe in doing the thing pro-
perly. Jones amused the Plush House with
his account of how lie had had to prune
requisitions. On one for the refurnishing
of Russell-street barracks he lopped off
£1100; another was reduced by £500; in a
third case the cut was a hundred or two;
in fact, the first draft of works estimates was
slashed wholesale. Jones has to keep on
telling officers that he hasn’t a goldmine or
an oihwell to draw on, although he is
Minister for Mines and Oil as well as for
Works.
Without intending it, the Westralian Leg.
Council is a great help to the State Labor
politicians when they are out after votes.
In one of its cranky moods it threw out a
useful bill designed to make one job of the
Commonwealth and State electoral rolls.
The duplication of enrolments and transfers
is an idiotic business, and three States have
dropped it; but Westralians are to be denied
the substantial saving in time and money
because the Leg. Council is a hog-headed
nark.
The Waterside Workers’ Federation has
nominally decided, in defiance of awards and
agreements, to enforce certain new “de-
mands.” No ballot was taken on the matter;
the decision was the work of the bullying
minority which forms a caucus inside the
union, and runs the show by clamor and
terrorism. Such disturbing bodies as the
Waterside Workers’ Federation and the Sea-
men’s Union are secret societies more than
anything else, and their inner government
should be opened to public inspection. The
union bosses having stopped half the day’s
work, the shipowners have adopted the logi-
cal course and announced their resolve to
stop the other half. There is to be a whole
strike or no strike at all. So the union
majority will possibly get busy at bringing
the union minority to its senses, if it has
any. Permanent deregistration of the
W.W.F. would help.
The Commonwealth Government is part-
owner of the Beam and part-owner of the
Pacific cable. A reduction of fourpence a
word has diverted 65 p.c. of the cable busi-
ness to the radio. An equal reduction on
cables wouldn’t help matters, as both sys-
tems are idle half their time. Yet until
wireless proves that it can’t be tapped or
jambed in time of war the cables will have
ENTER THE FAIRY.
“The biggest opposition to the Vic. Government’s Totalisator Bill is that the measure carries a
proviso for the retention of the bookmaker.”
PANTO.-PRODUCER HOGAN (to the 'pantomime moke ): “You enter gaily prancing with
the Fairy Queen perched on your back—how do you like the idea?”
to be preserved. Bruce despairingly suggests
that some of the profits on the Beam should
be transferred to the cable concern, but that
would be no remedy.
Hogan has launched a bill in Vic. Assembly
to give Melbourne City Council a milk-
distribution monopoly. To enable it to run
the show, and pay compensation, the cor-
poration is to be authorised to borrow up to
£150,000.; it is to acquire the milk, treat
it, and, if it thinks fit, license distributors
to leave the sealed bottles at households.
It is not certain that the Leg. Councillors
will do more than look at the measure if
it gets through the Assembly.
Analysing the Customs receipts for three
years. Minister Pratten said that Protective
duties were responsible for £13,562,000 out
of £25,845,000 in 1924, £14,144,000 out of
£27,081,000 in 1925 and £15,570.000 out of
£28,401,000 in 1926, revenue duties yielding
the balance. That proves what Pratten
didn’t set out to prove—that his “Protective”
duties weren’t high enough. Had they been
really Protective there would have been no
two-million. increase in two years.
Of course the Bavinshaw Government is
applying the gag in the N.S.W. Assembly,
and of course the Lang Opposition de-
nounces the gag as infamous. What no
Opposition ever admits is that it is gagging
all it knows. An Opposition’s business is
to prevent legislation, and a Government
applies the gag by shutting the Opposition’s
mouth. A Government’s business is to pass
laws, and an Opposition applies the gag
by making a noise and causing delay. In
principle there isn’t an atom of difference
between the two processes.
Labor-ruled Queensland, with an estimated
population of 894,000, had 6271 miles of
Government railway open for traffic on June
30. Labor-ruled Westralia, with an esti-
mated population of 385,000, had 3918 miles
open for traffic on the same date. The
gauge in each State is 3ft. 6in., and the basic
wage is £4 ss. for a 44-hour week. And
these were the financial results in 1926-27:
Queenslaml. Westralia.
Earnings £7,325,677 £3,607,989
Working expenses .. .. 6,495,322 2,685,693
Interest .. .. .. 2,794,720 887,740
Deficit . . .. . . .. 1,964,365
Surplus .. . . .. 34,556
The Westralian surplus was the third in four
years. The Queensland deficit was the
twelfth in 12 years.
Dr. Nott, M.H.R. for Herbert, has been
drawing attention to tlie number of sturdy
fellows employed on the Queensland rail-
ways and the curious increase shown in
State-election years. In 1921-22, which
wasn’t a State-election year, there were
14,862 on the wages staff (Westralia con-
frived to get along with 6330) ; in 1922-23,
a State-election year, there were 17,621.
Then there were 16,380 in 1923-24. 16,522
in 1924-25 and 18,419 in 1925-26—an
election year, of course. Theodore’s con-
queror suggests that this helps to explain
“the great. Labor victories” of which so
much is heard. It certainly throws light
on the terrific railway deficits.
Vic. Labor is making a determined effort
to capture the South Gippsland seat vacated
by the death of Bodman. an Independent.
Its candidate is M. B. Buckley, a Fish Creek
grazier, who was licked in April; the others
are W. West, ex-M.L.A., and T. J. McGal-
liard, two Nats.; R. J. Morley, a Cocky;
and G. R. Richmond, a rabbit-suppression
inspector, who resigned his State job to run
as an Independent. It has been remarked
that the proposed lines to connect Welsh-
pool and Port Albert with the existing rail-
way system were referred to the Railway
Committee during the campaign, and Mini-
ster Webber's production of Cabinet minutes
to show that the reference was arranged
for before Bodman died was received with
grins. The late member was all but Labor,
and made a practice of consulting Jewell,
the party Whip.
It was proposed to put the Savings Bank
Department of the Commonwealth Bank
under a separate board the better to handle
the advances for house-building. When the
directors discovered that it wasn’t proposed
that the Bank should make direct advances,
but that it should finance the State banks
and others to make the advances, they
could see no reason for the separation, where-
upon Earle Page had to come into the House
and do a complete somersault. But what
could you expect—with the Chairman of the
Bank in Melbourne, the Governor of the
Bank in Sydney, the Prime Minister in Mel-
bourne when he isn’t in Canberra, and the
Treasurer in Sydney or Grafton when he
isn’t rushing between the real capitals and
Canberra?
Premier Hogan has passed safely by one
of Vic. Labor’s unlucky days (Nov. 18),
and it now remains to be seen whether he
will steer past another (December 22).
The Prepdergast Ministry went out on Nov.
18, 1924, after having been exactly four
months in office. Elmslie’s Cabinet threw
up the sponge on December 22, 1913, after
13 days of the sweets. Compared with
Elmslie and Prendergast, Hogan is a long-
distance Labor Premier. He completed six
months on November 20.
Ilenare is having a royal time claiming
compensation for lands allegedly grabbed by
the pakehas during the wars of 60 and 70
years ago. The South Island Maoris got
£3(54,000 last year in respect of lands they
had probably never seen nor occupied. A
commission has just finished adjudicating
in the North Island on lands confiscated
after the wars. The Government is already
paying large annual sums for fishing rights
in Lakes Taupo and Rotorua, by arrange-
ment with the tribes concerned; but, not
content with this, individual owners have
made extravagant claims. Now the Wan-
ganui River Maoris want a cash solatium
for eel-weirs damaged by tourist steamers.
Disarmament is doubtless all right in its
way, but still militarism and navalism
involve much healthy exercise out of doors,
and tend to improve the human figure and
prevent slouchiness. They are better than
pushism. So the United States proppsss to
acquire 30 more cruisers and a number of
minor craft inside the next five years.
Whether any particular necessity is looming
ahead doesn’t appear.
Maoriland’s new Licensing Bill contains
something for everybody—and nobody is
satisfied. The prohibitionists are given what
they have been, striving for for years—the
elimination of the State-control issue from
future referendums. But they have to swallow
with that the restoration of the old decree
that prohibition can only be carried by a
55 per cent, majority. The wets gain the
advantage that in future prohibition refer-
endums will be taken only once every six-
years, instead of at every triennial general
election as was formerly the case. But the
bill imposes on the man behind the beer-
pump additional regulations.
There are signs that the brass-hats of
Bolshevism will begin, killing each other
before long. When a crude, uncouth revolu-
tion gets a considerable way from its start-
ing point it is always liable to produce two
irreconcilable parties. One says that pro-
gress must continue, being inevitable. The
other howls for a return to the early republi-
can “purity.” The Stalin mob, at present
on top, which may hang the Trotsky mob,
or be hanged by it, or a little of each, is said
to have issued a programme saying that it
is going to make a fresh start at the world
revolution, and to attend the Disarmament
Conferejice in the meantime.
The alterations to Maoriland’s Arbitration
Act are not as drastic as was expected.
Agricultural, pastoral and dairying indus-
tries are placed outside the scope of the
Act. Employers may introduce the piecework
system in any industry covered by an award
provided “basis of payment” is not less than
the award rate. The president of the Court
will ho longer be aided by two permanent
associates selected by employers and workers
respectively, but arbitrators appointed by the
employers and employees in any particular
industry will assist the Judge to decide dis-
putes. The Court in future—and this is a
radical alteration of principle—must--take
into consideration the economic condition
of any industry and fix wages accordingly. If
an industry is earning good profits the Court
will make an award on the basis of what it
considers a fair remuneration for services
rendered, but if it is in difficulties wages will
have to be trimmed down.

“Tarwin”: Re the two “official times” at
Broken Ilill (B. 17/11/'27). When the Day-
light Saving Bill came into force in Victoria
some years ago, I was running a bush school
in South Gippsland. As the local cockies
refused to have anything to do. with the new
idea, and sent their nippers along at the old
time, I had to leave the school clock as it
was. One day the district inspector ambled
along, and after a careful look at his watch
inquired after the health of our - timepiece.
I explained the local attitude towards day-
light saving, and pointed out that as 90 per
cent, of my pupils beat the sun into the
cowyard under the old time it was hardly
fair to expect them to get up an hour earlier.
The inspector, however, was adamant; school
was to be opened and the roll marked accord-
ing to new time, and all absentees were to.be
prosecuted. I hadn’t made up my mind
whether to buy a suit of armor or to resign
when the Government decided that what was
good enough for Britain was unworkable in
this country, and let us all put our clocks
on again.
“P.X.”: For a while the two times at
Broken Hill (B. 17/11 /’27) were an hour
apart. When the zone system was intro-
duced Melbourne and Sydney were on one
mark and Adelaide was an hour later. It
happened that just then Australia was
having the last of its great mining-share
booms; and Adelaide brokers found them-
selves handicapped .by coming into the
market an hour after their brethren of
Melbourne and . Sydney. If the overnight
news from a mine was bad the Easterners
thus had 60 minutes start in unloading;
and if the news was good Adelaide only got
in after Melbourne and Sydney had sent
the shares up shillings. To wipe out the
whole difference was more than the Govern-
ment cared to risk; but it. compromised by
making the difference half an hour.
“Mary Scott”: Our N.Q. seaside hotel
changed hands recently, and the Scotsman
who acquired the license has evidently been
a little staggered by the ultra-Bohemian ten-
dencies of his pat-
rons. Th e other
night my spouse
and I motored out
there, lured by the
moonlight and the
hope of oysters for
supper, and found
ourselves greeted
effusively for a
reason that soon
became apparent.
“ ’Tis a fair treat,”
remarked mine host
feelingly, “to see a
man with his own
proper missus. You

times they aren’t

mortally afraid
there’d be a scene
some night when
some chap came on

ing to be someone

fresh rush of cus-
tom.
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: If a seaplane from
the German raider Wolf ever did fly over
Sydney, “Gregor” needn't doubt that her
original intention was to drop bombs (B.
10/11/’27). The moral effect upon people
secure in the belief that they were thou-
sands of miles from the scene of war activi-
ties would have more than outweighed
THE NEW INFANT.
“Now, dear, what shall we do now?”
“Well, gran’ma, when you are tired of looking at the toys, we might go and see the
lingerie. There are one or two things I’d like.”
whatever risk the raider ran of discovery. In
any case I doubt if there were “dozens of
warships” available to search for her. The
Wolf, when she leisurely passed through the
Torres Strait, was easily discernible at
Thursday Island; she kept just out of range
of the shore batteries and made no attempt
to molest this outpost of Australia. And
there wasn’t a single warship in the vicinity
to give chase to the nonchalant raider as
she skipped through the narrow passage
dividing Australia from Papua.

“Chinta” : The telegraph lines were inter-
rupted outside Goulburn (N.S.W.) just
before the Melbourne Cup was scheduled to
start and a linesman was sent out to locate
the fault and clear the line. He soon found
the cause of the interruption—a long piece
of ware looped over the telegraph wires and
dropping down to form an “earth.” The
P.M.G.’s Department states that for many
years the lines between Melbourne and
Sydney have always been tampered with for
some minutes before and after each Mel-
bourne Cup, but the offenders have never
been detected. The crank or cranks respons-
ible for this form of mischief must view the
advent of wireless with disfavor.
* * * *
“Morkrum”: “Adsum” (B. 17/11/’27)
has a lot to learn about type-writing records.
The copy must be strange matter, not well-
known typing exercises; further, there is a
10-word penalty for every error. Thus
“Adsum’s” 137 words in one minute, less 70
for his seven errors, become a mere 67
words, and his 15 mistakes in 95 words
means an overdraft of 55. The performance
must last an hour, not a mere burst over
a minute. Tinder these conditions George
Hossfield. U.S.A., recently averaged 146
w.p.m. By far the best typists I have seen
were on the feminine side of the Wheatstone
copying-staff in Sydney G.P.0.; they
averaged not much less than Ilossfield’s per-
formance. I watched one copy 79 10-letter
jumble-code in a minute dead. That gives
158 5-letter words —12 more than Hossfield’s.
At Sydney Town Hall recently a girl still in
a learning class typed 92 words a minute
for 20 minutes, a wonderful performance.

“Kerys”: Bank-tellers’ luck is as often
out as in (B. 24/11/’27). Some years ago
a teller in a M.L. town found himself short
£2O at the end of tlie day. As he was. a
married man with a family the loss hit him
hard, for, of course, he had to make the
deficit good. A few days later lie left the
counter on which lie had worked for two
years for another. The newcomer, a pro-
moted youth, had a clean-up on taking pos-
session, and when the teller heard that a
£2O-note had been found wedged behind a
drawer his joy was beyond words. Unfor-
tunately for him examination revealed that
the note was a very ancient one, of a type
in use over 40 years ago, which had appa-
rently become fastened to the back of the
drawer and had gone in and out with little
damage for nearly half a century. The youth-
ful finder was permitted to keep the trove,
and eventually managed to get it cashed by
another bank. But the loser of the original
20 took a dour view of the situation; it
seemed to him that Fate had taken a hand
against him to the extent of £4O in a single
week.

“Kir” : Sydney’s about-to-be-abolished cor-
poration is far from being the first which
has failed to win public esteem. Recording
the arrival in the colony of Governor Fitz-
roy, on August 2, 1846, one newspaper
noted: —
The utmost propriety was observed generally, not-
withstanding the Tag, Rag and Bobtail of the town,
including the City Council, were assembled. Several
of the most distinguished of the latter worthies,
however, availed themselves of their privileges as
paymasters of the police, and left their proper
places in the mob to intrude themselves among the
official and other gentlemen collected to compliment
the new Governor.
“Their proper places in the mob” —could
restrained condemnation go further?
* * * *
“The Traveller”: I can recall non-
scheduled train stops which had no humorous
side. Some years ago, just as the Adelaide
express was about to pull out of Stawell
(Vic.), a man rushed up to the driver and
asked him if he could stop or at least slow
down at Lubeck. A woman lay dying there
and she had asked for a clergyman. After
a moment’s hesitation, the driver said, “Yes,
I’ll stop; tell the guard.” He stopped,
making up the time lost en route to Service-
ton. Later he got a “Please explain,” and
replied detailing what had happened, and
adding that in similar circumstances he
would do the same again. He didn’t get the
chance, for he was removed from his job on
the express. The introduction of speed
recorders on the locomotives has cut out
unofficial stopping of trains; nowadays the
speed-chart shows all stops.
POVERTY KEEPS ME PURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I love the whirl of the lighted street,
The merry twinkle of dainty feet,
The rhythmic swaying of silken hips
And the honeyed nectar of scarlet lips.
Oh, there is joy when the night wind sighs
In the starlit depths of a woman's eyes,
In the passionate kiss of a maid demure;
But poverty—poverty keeps me pure.
If gold were mine I’d drink Life neat,
Heaping my riches at Beauty’s feet,
And wine wherein golden bubbles float
Would loosen a song from my joyous throat.
Oh, how I envy the witless loon
Who sucked in his cradle a silver spoon ;
For brooding sorrow he holds the cure,
But poverty—poverty keeps me pure.
If I had money enough to burn
I'd do the wickedest things—in turn;
Draining the strong red wine of Life,
On a wild week-end with the padre’s wife.
I'd be a he-man picture star,
Whisking her off in a high-powered car;
A diamond tiara’s a subtle lure;
But poverty—poverty keeps me pure.
S.A.
WILLIAM JAMES DIGGER.


“C.Q”: This contrast doesn’t necessarily
prove anything, but it is interesting. When
a man smashed a jeweller’s window at Lud-
gate Hill, London, and 60 engagement-rings
were scattered in the street amidst heavy
traffic, every one was eventually restored.
When a thief did the same in Bourke-street,
Melbourne, recently, the crowd took home
£6OO-worth of the unexpected loot.

“Clievroford” : It is amusing to note how,
from being a few years ago a social pariah
liable even to have shotguns discharged at
him, the motorist, on the philanthropic side,
has become indispensable. He is expected
to transport electors to the poll, consump-
tive children to picnics and bush-tire fighters
to the field. In the country his benevolence
has practically eliminated horse- and foot-
travellers altogether. In the course of a
fortnight’s tour of Vic., N. S. Wales and
S. Australia recently I met only three
swaggies until I got near Melbourne. After
that there Avere plenty. The city motorist
doesn’t offer lifts to swaggies. He has heard
rumors that they bite.
"Oxmead”: A witness
who gave evidence before
the Film Commission con-
trasted the effects of
liolywood stuff on the
Australian native and the
South Sea Islander. The
former was perniciously
thrilled by scenes of
shooting and violence ; the
latter took more interest
in and got more harm
front the sexual appeal.
The Australian black,
according to the witness
—himself an ex-protector
of aborigines —is nor-
mally not lascivious; the
Kanaka is. Which is
doubtless the result of
heredity and environment.
The former has had to
hustle too hard for his
tucker to subordinate
hunting and fighting to
any other passion; the
islander, from a land
where nature is essen-
tially bounteous, finds the
lists of love more attrac-
tive than those of Mars.
That Black Brother
should be described as less
lustful than most recalls
that on the numerous
occasions when the merits
and otherwise of trans-
portation were debated
in the House of Commons,
one of the curious and
frequent arguments used
by advocates of the sys-
tem was that the hot sun
of Australia would scorch
or grill the evil passions
out of Britain’s erring
children. The French
may have entertained
some similar belief when
they set apart New Cale-
donia and Cayenne for
penal stations.
“Kune”: Ocean currents are slow and
unreliable letter-carriers; but they can be
uncannily accurate. On the 6th of May
last a passenger to Melbourne on the s.s.
Moeraki threw a bottled letter overboard
when 500 miles out from Wellington. Nearly
six months later the bottle was washed up
on the Ivaupokonui beach within a mile of
the residence of the person it was addressed
to - „ ,

M^ le ee^er ' : How long is it since ship-
builders gave up fastening vessels’ timbers
together with pure copper bolts? The
bones of a big ship have been discovered
buried beneath the sand fn the middle of
Umuda, a biggish island in the mouth of
the Fly River. Papua. Natives are stabbing
the island all over—after the method used
by the Austrian gumdiggers of Maoriland —
in the hope of locating chests- of doub-
loons or pieces of eight, but so far they
have had no luck. The copper bolts found
were a yard or so long and as thick as a
man’s arm.
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: Men-women (B
24/11/’27). I was managing a branch for
Singer’s on the Darling Downs, Queens-
land, and did a lot of travelling. On one
journey a decent-looking young swagman
asked me for a lift. Got into talk with
him, and as he looked a handy sort I offered
him a small wage to assist. Billy Martin,
as he called himself, accepted the offer grate-
fully, and for five weeks we shared rooms
in hotels, boarding-houses and my tent. On
reaching Toowoomba I paid him off. About
.12 months later I was walking down Queen-
street, Brisbane, when I noticed a neatly-
dressed young woman staring at me. Think-
ing it might be some client I had forgotten,
I raised my hat, and she held out her hand
and,, asked me if I remembered “Billy Mar-
tin.” I simply gasped and led the way to
the nearest tea-rooms. It was the result of
a love affair, she explained, but, pointing to
a wedding-ring on her finger, added that the
trouble was over. She was the most natural
male impersonator I ever encountered.

“Der Jong” : Cabled that an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease in the New Forest,
that ancient hunting preserve of England’s
kings, may necessitate the destruction of
the herds of deer and forest ponies that run
wild in its wooded glades. In South Africa
the dreaded rinderpest has been largely
spread in the great epidemics of the past by
tlie native animals, and particularly the buck
of various species. Even in the later days,
when the old-time Boer had been partially
persuaded that an attempt to stay the pest’s
progress was not a flouting of the ways of
Providence, the establishment of cordons and
BUDGET-DEBATE AMENITIES.
BILLY BOY: “Ech, ech, ech! Why don’t you rescue him? Frightened, eh?”
LIFE-SAVER BRUCE: “Er—why should you want him rescued? You pushed him in, didn’t you?”
others, restrictions on the moving of stock
proved futile, the wild buck carrying the
infection across veld and burg, according to
his kind. Not till the great visitation before
the South African War, which destroyed
most of the stock and buck from the Zambesi
to the Cape, was it possible to keep the pest
within bounds. Nowadays, with wholesale
and scientific inoculation and better fencing,
rinderpest has lost much of its terrors.

“Coot” : Humorous church notices. Out-

I found the following:—

Murkah : Few people know that the
experiment of prepaying postage by means
adhesive stamps, instead of collecting
charges on delivery, was first tried in
Sydney. Two years later England took it
up, and the rest of the world gradually
followed suit. The idea originated in
England, however, where it was first
advocated in a pamphlet issued by Row-
Bind Hill in 1537. A year later this pamphlet
came into the hands of James Raymond,
postmaster of Sydney, and in a memo,
to the Colonial Secretary of the period
he recommended that Hill’s idea of an
adhesive stamp should be tried in this part
of the world. Approval was given, and
on November 14, 1838, the new “stamped
covers” for letters addressed within the
limits of Sydney were offered to the public.
The charge was Is. 3d. per dozen —cheaper
than to-day’s rate and with an envelope
slung in.

“Trevdee” : “Unemployed ! Cripes, don’t
they know there’s a place called ‘The Bush’
in Australia?” Fannigan demanded of me
as he crushed some tobacco between the
palms of his hard hands. “Ain’t none of
'em ever heard of this!” He swept his arm
around towards the setting sun which was
throwing long shadows on his bare-looking
3000-acre issue of Western New South
Wales. “Here’s me,” he went on, warming
to his work, “a flamin’ man with only one
Pommy and one abo. and me to do all the
flarin’ work. The Pommy’s willin’ to work
but don’t know how ; the abo. knows how but
ain’t willin’; I’m both, so I ’as to do the
blazin’ lot; and then jest as I’m dead tired
I pick up the paper and read about the
blokes in Sydney goin’ crook ’cos they ain’t

“S.V.D.”: A Melbourne artisan, a
bachelor, boarded for many years with his
brother, who had a wife and three children.
On three occasions during the past three
.years the landlord’s agent called and noti-
fied an increase of rent. On each occasion
the householder protested that it would be
hard for him to find the money for the
increase, and each time the boarder came
to his rescue by volunteering to increase his
board money to the extent. of the rent
increase. When the boarder died recently an
examination of his papers disclosed the
amazing fact that he himself had purchased
the house about three years previously, a few
weeks before the rent began to go up. His
motive for obtaining increased revenue from
himself remains a dark mystery, for he
left all his possessions to his brother.
* * * *
‘‘Simon”: Around the camp-fire the talk
drifted to popularity and large funerals,
then it veered round to unpopularity and
small ones. Finally Long Jim tendered his
contribution. “Th’ most unpopular cove ever
I knew,” he said, “was Bill Dumplin, who
cooked at Jumbuck station in ’ninety-three—
a fair cow of a cook ’e was, too. When the
poor blighter died ’e only ’ad two at his
funeral—’imself and the blanky bloke that
drove the ’earse.”
* * * *
“Skyrider”: Most people have a simian
streak in them. At Taronga Park I watched
one of our tailed relations carefully collect-
ing nut-shells, tinfoil, babies’ comforters and
sucli-like trifles. Then I boarded a tram,
and pulled out a box of matches to light
my pipe. A man sitting opposite leant
eagerly forward. “Will you swap your box
for mine?” lie asked. As his was Australian
and nearly full, while mine contained 10
sticks from Finland, I obligingly complied.
“I’m collecting match brands.” he explained ;
“got four new ones to-day.” My right-
hand neighbor smiled a trifle patronizingly.
“Why don’t you go in for stamps t he
asked; “now I’ve got” Presently
another traveller butted in and told us of Ins
album crammed with beer-bottle labels—
I could understand collecting beer, but
labels? Apparently I was the only man m
the compartment who collected nothing
beyond impressions. *
“Holiepa”: The Maorilander can be just
as casual as the Australian. A well-known
flaxmiller crossed the Tasman quite recently,
and after enjoying a few aerial excursions
over and round Sydney conceived the idea
of buying an aeroplane of his own and mak-
ing the first flight to the Dominion. The
cables were got going, with the result that
tilt; men who built Lindberg’s machine m
America agreed to supply its duplicate for
£lO,OOO. The Maorilander then hired
Captain Moody, a Queensland aeronaut, to
go across the Pacific and take possession.
The ’plane arrived by the Niagara on her
last trip. Then, and not till then, appar-
ently. inquiries were made as to whether
the Commonwealth and M.L. authorities
would permit the flight. It was found that
they wouldn’t. The ’plane is stored in
Sydney, and the Maorilander wandered
casually home by the last boat.
* * * *
“Nomis”: Joynton Smith, M.L.C., tells
in his autobiography how, when he came to
Sydney 35 years ago, he used to turn up
at funerals to solicit orders for memorial-
cards, and found it paid to attire himself
faultlessly. His example has been lost on the
supers of the undertakery business whose
hat, frock-coat and pants rarely fit them any
better than their melancholy .expression. I
got an insight into the why of it recently.
An undertaker, collecting an overdue account
in our street, was offered an outsize in frock
coats that had been in the family for years.
“I’ll take it,” he said, adding sententiously,
“One touch of sorrow makes the whole world
the same size.”

“Spur” : Governor Phillip was not the last
Governor of a British colony to take the
oath abjuring the Pretender (B. 17/11/1271.
Governor Ilindmarsh, of South Australia,
took such an oath in 1833. So also did Grey
(1841), Robe (.1845), Young (1848) and
Mac Donnell (185(5) ; their signatures to the
documents may still be seen in the Adelaide
archives. There were three separate oaths
in those days, respectively concerned with
allegiance, supremacy and abjuration. When
Daly arrived in 1862 the three oaths had
been run into one, and the name of the
Pretender dropped.
* * * *
“E.J.M.W.” : As a professional dentist for
more years than I care to remember I abso-
lutely refuse to believe that any amateur
could fashion a usable tin denture with a
file and a knife (B. 17/11/’27). Even if he
could, tin in the mouth is affected by the
saliva and would not last more than six
months. I have myself fashioned a denture
from shell, but I have still to be consulted
by the patient to whom it would be the
least bit of use.
* * * >!*
“L.C.M-”: It may be safely said that
ammonia fumes, even from sheep-pens (B.
17/11/’27), are no more likely to cure whoop-
ing-cough than burying a penny at midnight
is likely to remove warts. Nevertheless there is
undoubtedly a widespread popular belief that
strong, pungent odors relieve whooping-cough.
Thus, while some mothers take the patients
to the gasworks, others put garlic in the
little sufferers’ socks. The effect when a
family of five so treated is brought into a
doctor’s consulting-room is startling. It is
curious to observe how the lay mind loves a
really nasty remedy.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Robert Lowe’s house Bronte,
which gave its name to the little inlet that
used to be Nelson’s Bay, is the latest of
Sydney’s old historic homes to come into the
auction limelight. Lowe built it in 1842;
seven years later he went to England, where
he was later to become Gladstone’s Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer and finally to reach
the House of Lords as Viscount Sherbroke.
Holdsworth, of the Iloldsworth, McPherson
firm, bought the place, and afterwards sold
it to E. S. Ebsworth. At a sale the other
day a reserve price of £l7 per foot was put
upon the land. A generation ago a buyer
would have expected an acre or so there-
abouts for that price.
* * * *
“Mei” : Currency takes some queer shapes
in N.-W. Queensland. Promissory-notes for
amounts from ss. up to £1 are issued by
several business firms and stations and re-
main in circulation for one year, being
accepted unquestioningly all over the Boulia
and Camooweal districts. Quainter substi-
tutes for coin or notes are eagle’s claws at
ss. a pair and dingo scalps at £1 apiece.
I once saw a five-pound “plaster” changed
for two dingo-scalps, four pairs of eagles’
claws and eight promissory-notes bearing
four different signatures.
* * * *
“Chant Pagan”: Mine must be near the
non-writing soldier’s record. I was four
years and 276 days soldiering, mainly “up
the line” at that, and I never sent or received
a letter. I took all my leaves, though.

“Gad”: Two wills recently admitted to
probate in England show that the fear of
premature burial still haunts some minds to
the last. A retired brass-founder, who died
at 82, left directions that two medicoes, after
applying every test they knew of to prove
life extinct, should put a strong dose of
prussic acid in his mouth, and then either
decapitate his body or dissect it by post-
mortem examination. The remains were
then to be wrapped in sackcloth and thrown
into the sea. The other testator left it on
record that he would be content with a
certificate from one medical man, provided
that the Association for the Prevention of
Premature Burial (to which he had sub-
scribed) should also be allowed to inspect
his corpse. After that it was to be cremated.

“Lucerne Flea”: A blacksmith at Boo-
boorowie (S.A.), having welded a broken
motor-axle as a favor for a friend,
asked a bystander to get some water to
quench the hot steel. The man returned with
A HOPELESS CASE.
“Let’s get married.”
“But, dear heart, I’m married already.”
“Damn! So you are! And now I come to think of it, I am, too.”
a full bucket and placed it beside the forge.
“Funny-looking water,” remarked the other,
as he tossed some on to the hot metal. A
spout of flame followed; a moment later
the blacksmith was on fire from head to
foot. He died a few hours later in the
Burra Hospital. The bystander had mis-
taken a bowser for the water-pump.
“M.G.S.”: I happened on the town of
Portland (Vic.) the other day when it was
celebrating its 93rd birthday,
and the State of Victoria might
have been doing the same. Port-
land had been flourishing under
the rule of the Henty brothers
for six months before Batman
landed on the banks of the
Yarra, and it would be flourish-
ing still if Melbourne hadn’t
amputated its future by denying
it railways. As it is, Portland
is the quaintest town in Vic-
toria. Its old shire hall might
have been lifted from the reign
of Anne. Its courthouse and
other public buildings are gems
of the restrained and beautiful
pre-industrial architecture of
Britain. The old Henty home-
steads are interesting ruins
and the botanic garden is per-
fect. Its chief monument com-
memorates the discovery of the
bay in 1800 by Lieut. James
Grant; the landing of the first
white man, master-mariner Wil-
liam Dutton, in 1828; the
ploughing of the first patch of
Victorian soil, and the meeting
of the astounded Major Thomas
Mitchell, of Sydney, with the
phlegmatic Henty brothers on
August 29, 1836. As Melbourne
hasn’t the slightest intention of
ever letting Portland become a
serious competitor for trade, I
suggest that the place be pre-
served as a national curiosity.
All buildings less than 70 years
old should be torn down and
cinema palaces and other new
structures should be built
according to plans that would
not revolt the splendid artistic
taste which evidently was
shared by the Hentys. Edward,
Stephen, Frank and John.
“Bullwhanger”: The news that a Malaita
chieftain and 45 of his tribe have been cap-
tured and “sloughed in” at Tulagi cala-
hoosh to await trial for murder sets me won-
dering how that institution will stand the
strain. It is only a few leaf huts enclosed
by a stockade, and the accommodation is
generally fully taxed. Brown Brother breaks
the white man’s laws without much compunc-
tion. doubtless reasoning that a spell in cala-
boosh is not much different from indentured
labor, except for the absence of pay and
tobacco. The incarceration of white men
on most of the islands is conducted on
much the same easy-going lines, a white
prisoner being somewhat of an embarrass-
ment to the Government. I knew a chap
who was doing three months for losing
his temper and punching a native in another
group. He spent most of his time lounging
on the verandah of his dungeon cell, a very
decent little weatherboard cottage on the

from a near-by Government official's house.
The only drawback, he confided to me in
the pub one day, was that he risked being

“A. Jack”: When the engine of the first
goods-train from Sydney arrived in Broken
Hill with a train-weight of 720 tons, it was
suggested that that was the heaviest single-
engine load that had ever come into the city.
The Silverton Tramway Company claims,
however, that its “A”-class narrow-gauge
engines regularly haul a weight of 750 tons
and sometimes 800 tons over a ruling grade

“Dinkum”: The most mysterious-looking
fire may have a perfectly natural cause. In
Gladstone (C.Q.) recently a hotel proprietor
followed the smell of burning wood into an
upstairs bedroom. The sun’s rays striking
through a carafe of water had ignited a
celluloid comb on a duchess chest. The
comb had been burnt, and the fire had pene-
trated through the cover into the woodwork.
Had no one arrived there might have been a
first-class blaze, and who would ever have
guessed the real origin?
“ Sky rider” : Casual Australians? I was
walking along a city footpath under a sky-
scraper when something hit me on the head.
Up went my hands involuntarily just in
time to intercept and hold a teacup. Looking
up I saw a hand waving wildly from a
window on the first floor, and presently a
damsel dashed out of the doorway. “Thanks,”
she said sweetly, as she took the cup from
my trembling hands. “Wasn’t it lucky it
didn’t break?” I thought it luckier that she
didn’t wrestle with crockery on the sixth
floor.

“X.D.”: It isn’t only in the matter of
offences against the human person that the
Law extends a long arm. A man was charged
at Kerang (Vie.) the other day with having
wilfully killed 137 opossums. The slaughter
dated back to 1914.

“Selma”: When the auditor of a big
Maoriland firm unexpectedly arrived the day
after the spring race meeting, distinct per-
turbation was evinced by one of the petty-
cash keepers, whose fellow-workers had bor-
rowed generously to put a trifle on their
fancies, and were awaiting pay-day to make
good the deficit. When it further transpired
that the auditor’s assistant intended to begin
with his department, the too accommodating
officer dashed per fire-escape dow r n to the
next floor and petitioned the petty-cash cus-
todian there for the loan of £lO. That
youth frankly confessed that he, too, was
hard up against it for a similar cause, but
entered into a pact with his fellow victim
and produced the cash. All went well on
the floor above, and as the budding auditor
was about to descend he was invited to
examine the new fire-escape, while an oblig-
ing clerk went down the ladder to the next
floor just to show how it was done. The
latter returned per stairs, minus £2O he had
left on the lower floor. The audit went off
successfully, but two chastened young men
have made it clear that there Avill be no
loans for the Christmas race meeting.

“Lao-dah”: A Melbourne baby recently
went on an Odyssey of which the full details
aien’t likely ever to be known. The infant,
a girl, came into this world in a nursing
home, and in response to an advertisement
two women arrived and expressed their joint
desire to adopt it. The mother had arranged
for a christening on the following day, but
handed the mite over to one of the women,
who hurried out ostensibly to get it some
clothes. She never returned. Two weeks
later the second woman came back with the
baby, hastily told a story of how the other
woman had taken it to Sydney, become
frightened at the publicity given to the theft
and finally sent it back. The raconteur then
deposited the much-travelled bundle and left
before she could be stopped. The baby
looked no better for its adventures.

“X2X”: During the last two years 15
sometime lepers have been discharged, cured,
from the lazaret at Peel Island (Q.). Out
of the 75 patients who are at present in the
hospital it is expected that more than half
will leave within the next few years with
a clean bill of health. Although the chaul-
moogra, or gynocardia, oil treatment is still
used, it is rapidly being superseded by the
newer and more efficient sodium-hydrocar-
pate method, given by injections. The oil is
present in the form of mixed ethers, so that
the patient escapes the full force of its
appalling taste and smell.
THE TRUTHFUI. BREAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. Boris Orlov, a psychologist, says that by
exposing their necks -women have also exposed their
minds. ‘When a woman is not telling the truth,’
he asserts, ‘she will blush in the area just below
the breastbone.’ ” — Melbourne Sun.
Tell me not of her candid eyes—
Soul-windows? Aye, but how the blue
Can mask the cunning soul that spies
So seeming-frank on me and you.
Baby-stares of an ingenue
May hide at will a secret sad,
So leave the artful for the true—
And look to the blushing breastbone, lad.
Her lips—you'll never there surprise
The facts for which you hotly sue;
And cheeks—they wear their own disguise,
Too thick for any shameful hue,
_ However mantling, to win through ;
Y*et, though she walk in armor clad—
Achilles had his weakness, too—
Give thanks for the blushing breastbone, lad.
Where words are vain and looks are lies
And each sweet maid’s an actress who
Is mistress of her art and wise
To every move and every cue,
One might with little more ado
Resign oneself to being had,
If it were not for this bare clue—
There’s a lie in a blushing breastbone, lad.

So let the wowser rave anew
At modes he labels mad and bad,
One honest spot they leave on view—
Hurrah for the blushing breastbone, lad !

A clear field, general prosperity and an
enterprising management have carried the
year’s profits beyond the £200,000-mark.
After allowing for the prefs.—there are
125,000 of them and they call for £8125 p.a.
—last year’s harvest was 35.1 p.c. on aver-
age ordinary capital compared with 34.9,
19.3, 36.4 and 32.6 p.c. back to 1923. Over
the same period the ords. have had an aver-
age of 181 p.c.; and in the 1924 reconstruc-
tion three new ords. were handed out for
every two then held, which makes last year’s
23 p.c. distribution equal to 34.5 p.c. on the
face value of old holdings.
The co. publishes the Herald, the
Weekly Times and the Sporting Globe
and owns the shares in two subsidiaries —
United Press Pty., Ltd., and Pictorial News-
papers Pty., Ltd. The latter took over a
competitor, the Sun News-Pictorial, whose
original owner retired from the field a couple
of years ago, and last year the infant sent
along £19,375 in divs. in respect of its 1925-26
operations. On Oct. 21 it bought the
Morning Post, which was first published
Nov. 9, 1925, in the interests of the Farmers’
party. The price spoken of was £31,000.
The other subsidiary publishes Table
Talk, the Listener In and the Aus-
tralian Home Beautiful. Just how much,
if anything, this tributory contributed to the
big stream last year is not clear from the
accounts. It paid no div. in 1926 although
each of its publications was then said to bo
earning satisfactory profit. So the parent
may be entitled to more profit than it has
yet claimed. On the other hand the £201,194
of profits shown in the table includes addi-
tions to reserves, and some of this may not
be true profit. The net amount claimed as
profit last year was £162,194; the other
£39,000 was added to the depreciation re-
serve. This comparison shows how the vari-
ous funds have grown since the reconstruc-
tion three years back :

Depreciation reserve .. 23,500 61,000' 100,000
Div. equalisation . . - 25,000 25,000
Newspaper plant leads a fast life and calls
for heavy writing down. But, judging by
the ring of this, the “Wild Cat” has not
overstated the position by treating additions
to the depreciation reserve as profit:—
The directors made special provision out of the
year’s accounts for the writing down of plant, which,
although serviceable, will have to be superseded be-
fore it is worn 0ut.... and the provision made is in
addition to the normal provision for depreciation
of plant and paper.
Competition, however, would seriously affect
earnings, and it cannot be dismissed as an
unlikely contingency. That the Herald thus
far has been successful in buying off its
opponents is no guarantee for the future.
In fact, the longer the general prosperity
continues and the more marked the success
of the co., the greater the temptation to those
who are looking for new worlds to conquer
to enter the field.

A prosperous year enabled the management
to clip £77,828 off the debt, reducing it to
£207,411, and the more or less liquid sur-
plus benefited to the extent of £76,101, mak-
ing it £418,252. New plant is to be installed
during the current term and freeholds
(£244,446, up £51,681) reflect preparations.
The market prices the well-protected prefs.
—they have a net tangible backing of
£6 Bs. 4d. each-—on a 6 p.c. basis. For the
ords. 675. is paid. At that figure the return
is 6.9 p.c. on a 23 p.c. div. basis, or only 5.4
p.c. if last year’s special bonus (Is.) is
excluded.

Half-way through the last term shareholders
were handed their juiciest plum—one fully-
paid bonus share for every two shai'es held
—from the invbstment orchard which the
late Henry Jones and his able lieutenant
Ach. Palfreyman started 18 years ago when
they formed the present holding co. to take
over the shares in the Jones jam group
and acquire and establish additional inter-
ests. _ The gift called for £455,492, and was
provided by writing up the book value of
the co.’s holdings in subsidiaries by that
amount, thus bringing the entry at least
that much nearer the truth. In addition
27,000 shares were issued at par to em-
ployees ; and all of this made paid capital
£1,893,476 on Oct. 31. The bonus issue, of
course, could have no effect whatever on the
earning power of subsidiaries, and share-
holders were told not to expect any increase
in the amount available for dividends, which
was another way of saying that the rate of
dividend must be reduced. The old rate
(13| p.c.) on the present capital would call
for no less than £32,500 more than last year’s
net profit. Actually, an interim Is. per
share from Australian earnings, and a final
9d. from the same source, with 6d. from
income earned outside Australia, was handed
out, thus making 11J p.c. for the year. In
June the board proposes to pay 9d. per share,
which, with a final div. at the rate last
declared, will make 10 p.c. for the current
term; and that fits in with the market’s
anticipations. The bonus issue makes a 10
p.c. distribution equal to 15 p.c. on the face
value of old holdings.
Last year the net earnings sprang £19,307
and most of the improvement seems to have
come from investments outside Australia;
they brought in £35,205 compared with
£23,549 in 1926. The return from Austra-
lian holdings was £125,497, or £6751 better
than in the previous term. The lot was
earned by assets lumped in one entry and
labelled “Investments —at valuation. Shares
and interests in jam-manufacturing and
fruit cos. in the Commonwealth of Australia.
S. Africa, New Zealand and England,” in
the books at £2,020,833, up £711,817 dur-
ing the year. On the other side of the sheet
the amount owing to subsidiaries mounted
£195,461, reaching £207,519; which suggests
that the pups or some of them are growing
fast. Not a word is said about the dis-
appearance of timber mills from the omnibus
entry last year. Maybe they were sold; if
so, just what the result was it is impossible
to say, so completely is the position obscured.
Timber propositions generally have been
having a thin time of late. A couple of
years ago the co. sold its San Francisco
business and bought an additional factory in
S. Africa and the Stanmore Preserving Co.
in Sydney. Then in 1926 Kirkpatrick and
Co., Nelson, one of Maoriland’s well-known
jam houses, was absorbed and a new factory
was put up in the North Island. What the
position of all the subsidiaries is only those
inside know. All that can be said definitely
is that the co.’s interests as a whole are
expanding, and a 10 p.c. div. on present capi-
tal will call for £19,756 less than was netted
last year. One of the pups, Henry .Tones
and Co., of Hobart, could show on its own
account net assets of approximately 82s. 3d.
per £1 share a year ago.
The market looks at the comfortable mar-
gin that has always been maintained between
earnings and distributions, the steady climb
of profits, the caution of the management,
and prices the scrip at 375. 6d. The return
at that figure is 5.3 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div.
basis ; and the net visible backing amounts
to 225. 9d. per share.

It was a fat year both for shareholders and
the co. As for the former, early in the term
bonus scrip was handed out, one for five.
That called for £24,500 and made paid capi-
tal £147,000, of which no less than £99,834
represents gift issues. And as for the co.,
trading results were the second best in its
history. The accounts modestly claim a net
profit of £26,313, but that was after £10,039
had dropped from somewhere into “specific
reserves,” making them £44.546. They were
dipped into for all but £5600 of last year’s
sweets, thus confirming the “Wild Cat’s”
action in treating them as genuine profit:
they are included with reserves in the table.
Spice was added to the icing on the share-
holders’ cake by way of a 6d. bonus handed
out with the final div., making 124 p.c. for
the year; and even then there was enough
left over to have paid almost another 12i
p.c. Only twice in the past eight years have
net profits fallen below last year’s div. re-
quirements, to meet which total funds (capi-
tal and reserves) at September 30 will have
to earn 7.8 p.c. The £36,354 netted last
year was 16.2 p.c. on average funds compared
with 11.3, 9.1, 15.6 and 16.6 p.c., back to
1923. So given even fair conditions of
trade, there is no doubt about the co.’s
ability to maintain a 124 p.c. distribution.
The co. got its opportunity during the
war, when costs restricted the use of metal
containers. Fielding’s slipped into the
breach with substitutes, and the initiative
and enterprise then displayed has been char-
acteristic of the management since. Im-
provement in manufacturing methods lias
constantly called for new plant, and that has
meant some heavy writing down of the old
machines out of gross profits. The following
comparison of balance-sheet figures reflects
rapid expansion, which for the most part has
been financed out of undivided profits :

Livelier turnover last year increased the
book debts, investments and cash (£119,136)
by £23,003, while only £4930 was added to
stocks (£30,045) ; trade creditors moved
up £5723 to £13,253, thus leaving a more
or less liquid surplus of £135,928 compared
with £113,719 a year earlier. The premises,
in at £56,068, are worth a lot more, and
judged on the past the value of plant, etc.,
is not likely to be overstated.
The market looks at the co.’s fine record
and strong position and offers 41s. for the
scrip, which has a net tangible backing of
31s. Sd. At the higher figure the return to
the investor is 6 p.c. on a p.c. div. basis.

*1 Deluding accumulations.
Earnings had the benefit of recent improve-
ments to tlie premises and gross profit
(£49,632) climbed £6282, but net profit
got only £1720 of the increase, making the
ratio to paid capital 7.3 p.c. compared with
6.3, 6.2, 5.7 and 10.1 p.c. back to 1923. It
is not a very impressive showing. Paid capi-
tal is in 7000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and 156,01 R)
ords., all fully-paid £1 shares. Half the
ords. are bonus scrip. The assets wei-e
written up £54,414 in 1920 to provide the
gift; hence the later struggle to pay even a
moderate dividend. Since 1920 shareholders
have received an average of just under 8 p.c.,
but it has taken all but £4036 of the total
net earnings (£94,536) to do it. Exes, are
heavy; they consumed 75.8 p.c. of last year’s
gross profit compared with 66.6 p.c. in 1923.
Gross earnings were then approximately the
same as they were last year.
Looked at from another angle the position
lias not improved either: —

Excess liabilities. . £19,186 £24,231 £26,662 £30,416
Thus in the past four years the liquid
position has gone back £11,230. Last year
freehold (£161,358) was unchanged; and
equipment is maintained in good order out
of current revenue, the report says. Furni-
ture and effects stand in the books! at
£36,438, or £1964 more than they did five
years ago. Meantime £6BOO has been added
to the depreciation reserve (£11,600), mak-
ing it 31.8 p.c. of the book value of plant,
etc.* which depreciates very rapidly. And
that is leaving out of consideration the
building, which won’t last for ever. So, all
things considered, it is doubtful whether the
dividends paid during the last four years
have been really earned.
The board says prospects are bright and
the market, which had backed the manage-
ment and anticipated the future paid as
much as 225. for the scrip a few months
back, now gives only .19s. 6d. for the ords.
At that figure the investor gets 7.2 p.c. on
his money as long as the 7 p.c. div. con-
tinues, and that is by no means safe. The
security amounts to 18s. Id. per ord. share
in net tangibles.

Mining still represents a substantial part of
the co.’s activities; but only through its
chemical (superphosphate) works and other
interests has it been able to continue as a
copper-producer, paying good divs., while
other Australian copper, concerns have been
strangled one after another by mounting
costs and falling markets. The latest tomb-
stone is in memory of Mt. Morgan; there is
still £15,000,000 of metal ,in the old mine,
but it can only be got out at a loss under
existing conditions. When hours were re-
duced from 48 to 44 per week in 1917, ore
production at Mt. Lyell immediately dropped
from 10.2 to 8.2 tons per man per week.
It has taken nearly 10 years and heavy
capital outlay to get production back to
the 10.2-ton standard. But meantime costs
climbed, and, according to the chairman’s
figures, for the five years to Sept. 30, 1926.
the average net profit from mining was about
£20,000, and that was without charging
anything for taxation or mine wastage. Last
year electrolytic copper averaged £62 11s. lid.
compared with £69 Is. lOd. for the five years
to 1926; and with a lower output, due partly
to industrial trouble and partly to alterations
to the treatment plant, and with a slight
decline in the grade of ore, copper could not
have provided much of the £246,359 netted.
Here are the output and recovery figures,
with comparisons:—

and 90.74 p.c. in 1924, which, amongst other

Freight and copper charges 74,493 82,440 62,221
But it is distinctly to the credit of the
management that it was able to cut so deeply
into costs. During the year the North Lyell
tunnel was driven 3088 feet —it will be 7000
feet long when completed—the idea being to
connect the North mine with the treatment
works at Queenstown, and thus eliminate the
present expensive haulage and transport sys-
tems and facilitate other economies. It is
anticipated that the work will be completed
during the present term, and the cost, includ-
ing equipment, is figured at £60,000. Thus
far £24,868, of which £20,000 has been
charged to prospecting and development, has
been spent. Recent improvements in metal-
lurgical practice have been followed by ex-
ploratory work on the low-grade ores in the
Comstock, Tharsis and Prince Lye 11 leases,
but development there will be largely governed
by industrial awards. Conditions in the
industry are such that the board has been
compelled to ask the Government for a
bounty on the copper produced.

A new sulphuric-acid plant was placed in
commission at Yarraville, and the demand
for the co.’s super, in Victoria was a record.
The growing activities at the Port Kembla
mills, where copper wire, cables, tubes, etc.,
are turned out, may be surmised from the
fact that practically the whole of Lyell’s
copper output last year was sold locally, and
that is a distinctly encouraging feature. The
erection of a new electrolytic refinery at
Queenstown (Tas.) was commenced dur-
ing the term. The cost is set down, at
£75,000, and £29,132 of it had been spent
when the books closed. The new plant will
use surplus juice from the co.’s Lake
Margaret installation ; and all told a saving
of £4 per ton of copper produced is expected
—equal to over £22,000 on last year's
figures.
At the annual meeting next week, share-
holders will be asked to increase nominal
capital from £1,300,000 to £2,500,000, but
there is no mention of any immediate in-
tention to make a new issue. Paid capital
is now £1,289,195, and at Sept. 30 share-
holders could see 12s. 3d. per £1 share in
surplus liquids ; 15s. 3d. in chemical works,
shares, etc.; 3s. 2d. in railways, etc.; and
10s. 2d. in the mine and plant, the worth of
which is governed by the price of copper.
The market values the scrip on an industrial
basis and offers 28s. Id. At that figure the
return is S p.c. as long as the 11] p.c. div.
continues.

If man had done as well as nature Aus-
tralia might be looking forward to a great
time ; for late rains have saved most of the
wheat crop, and pastoral prospects are
exceptionally good. But we have had an orgy
of extravagance, mostly on credit, and
November closed with Smith and Wadding-
ton, Sydney body-builders, closed, and the
£1 ords. quoted as low as 2s. 6d., and with
Geo. A. Bond’s, the silk-wear manufacturers,
who employ 1200 hands, going into liquida-
tion. In Smith and Waddington’s case
management was obviously at fault; in the
other the halting tariff is to blame. It is
now a matter for the Federal Parliament to
deal with. Australia is being smothered
under cheap stockings from Germany and
elsewhere; and that flood simply has got to
stop. Governments cannot escape the con-
sequences of their own acts. They have
established certain standards of living, and
manufacturers have to pay their employees
accordingly. Governments which refuse or
delay to give protection necesary to main-
tain industry under those standards of living,
imposed by themselves, can only be regarded
as directly responsible for the slaughter of
the industries. This applies not merely
to Bond’s. It applies to the Broken Hill
Prop.’s steelworks and a hundred other
industries as well. If Parliament quits its
job at .Canberra without attending to this
matter, every man and woman thrown out
of a job through the pressure of foreign
competition will be entitled to regard the
Government as primarily responsible. And
every man and woman who loses capital
in these industries from the same cause will
be entitled to come to the same conclusion.
This is not a matter of politics of the party
sort; it is a matter of plain business.

and his chances of making heavy losses are.
great if he does not keep himself well
informed of all that is happening. The “Wild

stances ; and a study of the December num-

“W’gabba”: Randolph Bedford says
(B. 24/11/'27) that Roma oil is not a con-
densate and that the evidence is all against
long-distance migration or condensation. Prof.
Steele and J. B. Henderson ought to be best
fitted to describe the oil, and they have both
stated it is a condensate. It is certainly a
very abnormal crude, averaging about 93 p.c.
of the very highest fractions of petroleum.
The heavier fractions that Steele first got in
his paraffin chain have long disappeared, and
their failure to reappear has given rise to the
belief that they came from lubrication in the
first instance.
Apropos a list of 38 men and corporations
printed last week and said to be the names
of the holders of permits to test the country
surrounding the Roma bore, Randolph Bed-
ford says that “Randolph Bedford and C 0.,”
included in the list, has no existence and
never had; moreover, he personally holds no
permits. The Bulletin gladly withdraws
its old contributor’s name from the list,
though it sees no reason why he shouldn’t
hold a permit if he wants to. A man of his
amazing energy wouldn’t shepherd it, any-
how—which is certainly what many of the
other holders will do.
“Catalyst”: Now that the fifth bore at
Roma has reached the gas zone that was
discovered 27 years ago, it should be of
interest to weigh the chances of finding
wells in the immediate neighborhood of
Roma. The case for them :
(a) The Roma bore is a dripping bore, i.e., it
drips petrol and kerosene occasionally.
(b) Many of the greatest oilfields known have
no better surface indications.
(c) Most of the world’s oil is drawn from beds
of the same age (Cretaceous) as Roma.
(d) The experts, Woolnough, Ball, Cameron, Jen-
sen and Steele, have made optimistic utterances
about Roma.
The case against them :
(a) The Roma gas is a “dry” gas and the heavier
and wetter a gas is the more likely it is that oil
is present.
(b) Most of the world’s great oilfields contain
indications of some sort.
(c) Gas is elusive; it is wherever there is any
old porous strata which allows it to permeate and
leave its oil behind. Oil, if it moves at all, is
liable to be pulled up by a fault or intrusion or
adsorbed in clay or any other material. Therefore
the missing part of the Roma gas may be hundreds
of miles away.
(d) The Cretaceous formation has provided many
gas wells containing no oil worth while.
(e) Dr. Wade, who knows many oilfields, did not
enthuse over the prospects at Roma; and the
Anglo-Persian geologists came and went and were
silent. The optimistic experts mentioned above have
never seen an oilfield.
(f) E. H. Cunningham Craig, the great English
authority on oil, in his book on “Oil Finding”
writes inter alia in regard to Roma: “That the
strata here at one time contained oil cannot be
doubted on the evidence collected ; that the oil was
never concentrated seems equally certain; that the
oil has been inspissated and probably adsorbed at
great depth is evident; and that the gas is still
present in great quantity beneath the water-bearing
strata in favorable localities has been proved by
boring.”

Although the agreement between the
Broken Hill mining cos. and the unions
expires on December 31, the town is more
concerned about the water supply than the
industrial situation; if there is no flood by
April the supply for the mines will be _ ex-
hausted. Opposing the suggestion that unions
should close their books against Southern
Europeans, E. Wetherell, editor of Barrier
Daily Truth, which is owned and has its
policy dictated by the Workers’ Industrial
Union (the miners’ organisation), has
appealed to unionists to “do nothing which
would give masters an excuse for closing the
mines still working.’’ The managers have
invited the unions to a conference, and
although everyone expects the cos. to request
a more reasonable attitude on the part of
the unions, and the unions to ask for an
amelioration of the present “oppressive con-
ditions,” everyone also expects that things
will remain as they are with, perhaps, the
straightening-out of one or two small anom-
alies. The present agreement provides for a
35-hour week for underground men and 44
for surface men ; a basic wage of 15s. a day
with quarterly adjustments on the local cost-
of-living figure; and a bonus of 2d. a day
when lead is £3O a ton. with an additional
2d. for every £ lead is over that. Faced
with a water famine and low lead prices,
mine-workers know they can’t expect any-
thing better, though they are asking for,
among other things, £7 a week.
v
“Karang” : The continued fall in the price
of tin has not lessened the total output,
as it does with most commodities. One
reason is that it is a horribly expensive
business to hang up a dredge and wait for
better prices—which may be a long time
coming. Another point is that in spite of
the huge modern dredges the tin derived
from Malayan shows by their agency is only
about 20 p.c. of the total output. The balance
comes from the thousands of Chinese-worked
shows, in which the humble coolie is the
most considerable portion of the “plant.”
The coolie is paid by results, so much for
the weight of tin he can “scratch” in a day.
With the metal at, say, £270, a pound of tin
a (lay brings him in all he wants, for he does
not, in spite of theories to the contrary, work
himself to death for the sheer love of it.
When tin drops he has to get more of it
daily to maintain his standard of living.
Instead of a pound a day, he roots out a
pound and a quarter or maybe a half. Thus
production from one of the industry’s prin-
cipal sources is actually increased. The
later falls and fluctuations in price are prob-
ably due to an accumulation of stocks by
consumers, or a determination to reduce
buying; perhaps both. As far as the Aus-
tralian share market is concerned, matters
are on a different footing. Many brokers
are carying big parcels for their clients
on a very small margin, and every effort is
being made by those interested to hold up
share prices. But the market is very shaky,
and a slide may come any time. The sooner
the better, for that will enable business to
be done on a sounder basis.

Morobe Guinea Gold, an Adelaide flota-
tion, is the first of the New Guinea ven-
tures to proclaim that all that glitters in
the Bulolo and Edie Creek valleys is not
gold. The directors have announced that the
field-manager’s report on the Cliffside leases
states that these are not worth purchasing.
Moreover, the sluicing area of the Bluenose
and Papuan leases is too narrow for satis-
factory work, and the side areas have only
been pegged “for the purpose of sale.” Also
the Gorge lease is too limited for the outlay
of capital on machinery, and not worth pro-
ceeding with. The directors are considering
what policy to adopt.
* * * *
Guinea Gold, which is resuming work on its
original Bulolo leases, after having concen-
trated on the testing of other holdings under
offer to Territory Investments, has received
word from its field superintendent, Brought-
on Jensen, that the resumption of pro-
duction on Ivoranga Creek has yielded 611 oz.
gold from ground-sluicing. With 400 oz. in
hand at the end of September the co. is now
holding lOlloz. This includes a clean up of
485 c.y. on the Dovercourt section of the
lease, returning 2340 z. gold—a little over
244 d. per c.y. Three more faces have been
prepared, and four faces are now being
operated.

The old mines on Irvinebank (N.Q.) con-
tinue to supply the bulk of the tin there.
Both Rebound and Perseverance are on
exceptionally good ore. The latter has an
18in. reef prospecting 15 p.c., and its last
crushing of 21 tons gave 4\ tons concen-
trates worth about £630, or £3O a ton. The
Rebound has a nice parcel ready for crush-
ing, which is estimated to go 12 to 15 p.c.
These are good values, for 70 p.c. concen-
trates are bringing £155 in the North at
the present.

The manager of Great Northern Tin, Her-
berton (N.Q.), has lost track of the tin in
the east lode, but has made a find at the
top of the 300 ft. big stope on the Gully.
They are driving north on this, but it is
yet too early to say if the bunch is good.
It looks to have possibilities. In another
stope a face 20ft. by 6ft. is being broken
for 3 p.c. to 4 p.c. ore. but this won t
pay dividends, although it is worth following
up. Great Northern is still worth a shot
from those who love a gamble.
At the instance of Dr. Jensen, who has
been on the spot, Mitchell River (N.Q.) has
completed the boring of 50 acres of tin-
sluicing ground on Roots Creek. The co.
closed on the option before the last bore was
completed, which looks as though the wash-
ings were O.lv. As there is a good gravity
supply of water the co. is going to work the
ground with a jet elevator. The bigger areas
on the Mitchell are now being bored.
* * * *
Strenuous efforts are being made in Lon-
don and Westralia to form a new co. to
acquire the heavily-mortgaged Golden Horse-
shoe and its partly efficient and partly inef-
ficient plant. When operations ceased last
year for want of funds ore reserves were
reckoned in hundreds of thousands of tons,
with good patches in some places. Since
then, while the officials of the old co. have
been cleaning up around the plant and keep-
ing the workings unwatered, some tributors
on the adjoining Gt. Boulder are alleged
to have knowingly or unknowingly broken
through in Horseshoe ground and done ex-
tremely well.
* * * *
Another year has passed without Freney Oil
Co. (W.A.) striking payable oil, and in view
of the approach of the rainy season it is
probable that boring will shortly be suspended
until March next. While indications point
to the occurrence of oil at one time on the
co.’s area, it still remains to be proved
whether the supply from which it was de-
rived exists now and in payable quantities.
The problem can only be solved by drilling,
in which Freney intends to spend its last
bob and all the Federal subsidy it can get.
* :I: *
Malim Nawar South paid its third div.
of Is; on November 30. It was the earliest
of the Kinta-Kampar Valley properties to
be equipped, and the 487 tons tin recovered
to date from 1,889,000 yards is the first
contribution to the world’s tin supplies by
the large and swampy Lower Perak area.
The co. has about 50,000.000 yards phis
about 200 acres recently added, and
have made a profit to date of about £50,000,
of which £19,500 has been distributed.

Capt. John Piper, tvlio gave his name to
Point Piper, nowadays the most fashionable
of the Sydney Harbor “points,” was one of
those early officials who planted a family ir.
N. S. Wales. David Piper, a grandson, iives
at Five Dock. His father, Captain John’s
youngest son, died no further back than 1912,
notwithstanding that Captain John first came
to Sydney in 1792. In other words, there
were 120 years between the arrival of Capt.
John in Sydney and the death there of his
youngest son.
A brilliant military career was cut short
when W. J. Foster died in England. Born
in Warwick (Q.), he left Australia in 1914
as a staff officer of the Permanent forces, and
saw service on Gallipoli and later as a
brigade-major with the Anzac Mounted Divi-
sion. Promotion was quick, and he was
appointed G.S.O. to the Yeomanry Mounted
Division, later the 4th Cavalry Division,
under General Barrow. After the war Foster
commanded a mounted force in Upper Egypt
during the rising of 1919, and then went on
to the Staff College at Camberley, England,
where he passed with distinction. On his
return to Australia he became Director of
Military Operations and Intelligence, and
returned to England early this year to take
over the command of a British cavalry bri-
gade at Aldershot. Later, he was to have
gone for a 12-months’ course in the Imperial
Defence College, where only picked seniors
of all the Imperial forces go for final staff
training. He was only 46 when the Last
Post sounded.
John Duncan St. Clair Maclardy was an
inspector of schools in N.S.W. at 25; and
he served the Education Department for 40
years up to his retirement five years ago.
lie spent his last 10 years in. harness as
chief inspector ; before that he was principal
of the Teachers’ Training College. A Mait-
land boy, Maclardy did brilliantly at the
Sydney Grammar School and University,
where he won a travelling scholarship that
took him abroad for four years. On his
return lie was given an inspectorship in the
department in which he spent all his work-
ing life.
The arrival in Sydney of a travel-worn
car decorated with spears, nullas and buf-
falo-horns registered the conclusion of
another round-Australia trip. The adven-
turers were F. J. Dean, of Belmont
(N.S.W.), and his wife. The trip occupied
nearly 20 weeks. Quicksands in Nor’-Wes-
tralia, danger from hostile blacks and a long
parched spell before the travellers learnt
how to dig for soaks were some of the
experiences which enlivened the run.
Coates, M.L.C., who opposed Willis for the
Labor leadership of the N.S.W. Legislative
Council, was a traveller with a big Sydney
firm when first he became prominent in
politics. When the iihporters and ware-
housemen of Sydney commanded their staffs
to howl down Ghai’les Kingston and so give
JOE COATES, new leader of Labor party
in N.S.W. Leg. Council.
an appearance of public protest against his
tariff proposals, Coates helped in the suppres-
sion of the tumult from the platform. King-
ston changed the jeers to cheers by the time
he had concluded. The next day Coates was
sent for by his boss. “Mr. Coates” —“Here
comes the sack,” thought Coates—“l want
to express my admiration of your courage
and independence.”
John Hardie Lavery, Bananaland Rhodes
Scholar for 1928, is a product of Brisbane
Grammar School and Queensland University.
Engineering is his line —not usual in
Rhodes scholars. He has taken his degree in
that faculty, and he will enter the School
of Engineering Science at Oxford, with a
special eye on structural design and the
architectural side of his profession. An all-
round athlete, he has represented his univer-
sity in cricket, football, swimming and on
the running track.
F. W. Furkert, civil engineer, is the person
most to be reckoned with when public works
are proposed in
Maoriland. A
Wes 11 and e r by
bi r t li. he went
into the P.W.D.
draughting-room as
soon as he left
school, 33 years
ago, and climDed to
the top of the de-
partment in 1920.
He has made rail-
ways and roads in
every part of the
Tremulous Islands,
and so far has
strenuously resisted
all attempts to
wrest hydro - elec-
t r ic development
from his grasp.
Premier Coates rer
gards him as infal-
lible. Furkert is
as near an absolute
autocrat in his de-
partment as any
man can be in a
decently - conducted
civilised State.
F.W. FURKERT,
M.L. Public
Works engineer.
The newspapers are to have Commissioner
David Bell, one of the City Council reps.,
to abuse as chairman of Melbourne Board
of Works in succession to the discouraged
Carre Riddell. Bell was elected to the
council in 1909, and has been a member ever
since. If there is any committee he hasn’t
served on in the interim, it was so unimpor-
tant that its name has been forgotten.
Maoriland has for its Rhodes Scholar this
year a young man who should come near to
Cecil Rhodes’s ideal. E. E. Bailey is an
Otahuhu native, and although still on the
young side of 21 is a solicitor of the Auck-
land Court. His prowess at football and
tennis supplied the necessary athletic quali-
fication.
Betsy Matthias, the red-haired lady who
was prominent in the ructions in N.S.W.
Parliament House when it was invaded by
the unemployed, is the grand-daugliter of the
Geoffrey Eager who was once Colonial Trea-
surer. She has been a prominent figure in
Sydney’s Bohemia, and conducted at one time
a place where wine and spaghetti were to
be had in an atmosphere that looked artistic-
ally correct. She has an ambition to be
an Australian Berta Goldman; but Aus-
tralian conditions do not give much scope
for such dramatic ladies.
John Garlick, chairman of the Ma State’s
Main Roads Board, whose name has been
mentioned in connection with the chairman-
ship of Sydney City Commission, was born
at Sheffield in 1875. He came to Australia
as a toddler, and a shade over 40 years ago
sold newspapers in Sydney’s streets, but
donned the respectability of a very junior
clerkship in the N.S.W. Railway Depart-
ment at 14. In 1896 he became manager of
a Melbourne company, but returning to
Sydney re-entered the Civil Service and was
appointed officer-in-charge of Local Govern-
ment. He owed his first big rise to Arthur
Griffith, who, when Minister for Local Gov-
ernment, made him a full-blown under-
secretary.
Frank Stuart is the only qualified teacher
of fencing in N.S.W. Five years ago he
was badly smashed in a motor accident. The
doctors said that even if he lived he would
always he a cripple. Stuart thought other-
wise. To-day he is back at nearly normal
strength, and apart from his Swords Club
is instructor of the N.S.W. Police Force.
Archibald F. Reid, who recently celebrated
his hundredth birthday in Adelaide, was bora
in India in 1827. Reid joined the navy,
and took part in the bombardment of
Odessa, and witnessed the charge of the
Light Brigade and the Siege of Sebastopol.
Later, he served under Peel in the Indian
Mutiny. He arrived in Adelaide in IS7O and
decided that the incidents he had crowded
into his early years were sufficient to see him
out. For more than half a century he has
lived quietly in the City of Churches.
Peter Mazzer, who died recently near Lis-
more (N.S.W.), was one of the original
founders of New Italy. The colony was
established by some of the survivors of the
ill-fated Socialistic colony in New' Ireland
founded by the Marquis de Ray. Mazzer
was born in Northern Italy 78 years ago.
and joined the Marquis's expedition, arriving
at the site of the proposed colony in 1880.
The settlement was abandoned after disease
had wiped out most of the colonists. Those
who were left sought refuge in Sydney.
Henry Parkes, then Premier, sent a number
to the Richmond, where they converted a
wilderness into a garden. Mazzer leaves a
host of good Australian descendants of the
second and third generations, many of whom
served in the A.I.F.
E. H. Bourne, Superintendent of Tele-
graphs in Bananaland, who took over control
of the Vic. network a few months ago, had
hardly unpacked before he was lifted to the
job of chief manager for the Commonwealth,
the position vacated by the transfer of
Malone to the control of wireless. This
means a move to Canberra, the Siberia of
the public service of Australia.
Sydney has a suburban swaggie. The
ancient is known from Leichhardt to Parra-
matta as “Old Parramatta.” and he humps
a matilda nearly as big as his frail self.
He has his regular ports of call, and the
dwellers along the route see to it that the
tucker bag is never empty. Weeks elapse
between visits, for the old chap makes slow'
time of it. Periodically he goes into Lewis-
ham Hospital for an overhaul. Few know
that “Parramatta” was once a successful
teacher in a well-known religious confra-
ternity. But the lure of the road and the
open spaces proved too strong to resist.
Parramatta says he will carry his swag
untilr*he takes the Long Road west.
C. R. Herschell has done some excellent
work in getting little-known Australia upon
the screen. His Northern Territory series
was an epic. Tlis latest exploit was to pro-
mote the filming of the lyrebird in its natu-
ral surroundings. R. T. Littlejohn carried
out the difficult operation of spying on the
shy creature with a camera, and it took him
five years to do it satisfactorily.
Colonel Dickie Dowse, who in his capacity
of Marshal of the Federal High Court was
called upon to heave out a turbulent bar-
rister, is one of the mildest-mannered of
soldiers. A Queenslander, he commenced
his soldering at the tail end of last century,
in the Q. M. Regiment, which he accom-
panied to South Africa. After the Boer
War he held many permanent staff appoint-
ments, and during the Big Stoush was on
the headquarters of the Fourth Division.
Dowse is a bookish man and a great lover
of music, and to the host of friends he left
behind in the military forces he has added
as many in civil life.
The Melbourne and Metropolitan Board
of Works has elected City Councillor David
Bell to be its chairman in place of Carre
Riddell, retired. The new chairman was a
city representative on the board, and has
also been chairman of the Finance Com
mittee for many years. A public account-
ant by profession, he has long shared with
DAVID BELL, new Chairman of the Mel-
bourne Metropolitan Board of Works.
Alderman Cabena the burden of the city's
finance, and has a logical way with him in
debate which carries conviction. He may
not be the most popular member of the
Victorian Club, but he is well in the running.
His hobby is watching Carlton play footbail
or cricket.
SOLD AGAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Premier said that Mr. Kay had sold his
constituents for £7500, payable in five annual in-
stalments of £l5OO. He had never done sixpenny-
worth of work at the Meat Board The bill to
remove Mr. Kay from the Board has been passed by
both Houses and awaits the Governor’s assent.”
iEsop you have doubtless studied. Are you
feeling somewhat, say.
Like the dog that dropped the substance for
the shadow', Mr. Kay 7
True, you never paralleled that trustful
canine’s foolish feat;
What you sv'apped your little bone for was
unouestionably meat;
Not an optical delusion, mirrored in a glassy
creek,
But a genuinely choice and jiucy sirloin, so
to speak.
And the better of the bargain you opined
you had, I’m sure,
Bartering for a steady billet a position less
secure.
Now it’s reft from you abruptly, are you
feeling sorry, eh,
That you didn’t look ahead a little further,
Mr. Kay?
Had you known that Lang in office had so
little time to stay
Would you have been quite as free from
apprehension, Mr. Kay?
Would the value that you couldn’t give, the
screw you couldn’t earn,
Have appeared to you a matter of such
utter unconcern?
Would you have repented selling your con-
stituents for pelf
If it hadn’t made the bargain—and the
buyer and yourself—
Into an election issue? If you’d had a
glimmering how
Your advancement would occasion such a
devil of a row
I suspect that you’d much sooner have con-
tinued M.L.A.
With a shadow of a chance of re-election,
Mr. Kay.
Will you. once again unmuzzled, once again
Domainw’ards stray
And harangue the proletariat on the
Sabbath, Mr. Kay?
Will those sentiments uplifting glibly, virtu-
ously flow’
From your busy lips as in the not so very
long ago?
Will you pillory oppression—and corruption?
Doubts assail.
Still you yet may point a moral, you may
yet adorn a tale
Without stepping on a soapbox. Politicans
oft have ta’en
Cushy jobs for selling voters and will (doubt
it not!) again.
But w'hen next they try the nobbling I can
hear some patriot say
“Blow your Government appointments! I
remember Mr. Ivay!”

General Motors Service Everywhere
JT is General Motors policy to have right
service available all over the world, to
owners of General Motors cars. To this end
there is located in each of Australia’s five
States, a General Motors plant, each one of
which is the headquarters for General Motors
Service in that State.
Here Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile,
Oakland, Buick, La Salle, Cadillac and Vaux-
hall cars are made ready for delivery to
General Motors dealers.
Complete stocks of parts for all General
Motors cars are carried —in order to serve
dealers promptly, and in order that dealers
can serve you promptly and efficiently.
From these plants General Motors experts
aid dealers in establishing parts and service
facilities and in training Australian workmen
for efficient service work.
As rapidly as possible Australian dealers
are aided in establishing standard General
Motors service practices to the end that every
owner of a General Motors car shall receive
efficient, economical service from his General
Motors car.
General Motors cars are everywhere—-
and General Motors service is everywhere.
Wherever you buy your car —wherever you
travel —whichever General Motors car you
buy—somewhere near you there is a General
Motors dealer who is able and willing to serve
you.
Each year General Motors grow —as each
year more people learn that General Motors
cars give the utmost in quality and value,
and that everywhere General Motors service
facilities are constantly being improved and
increased.

“Sea Nomad”: There exists keen rivalry
among all the Torres Strait island boys in
the handling of their up-to-date shelling fleet.
The western islanders lose no chance of de-
ENVY.
predating their cousins of the eastern group ;
Badu and Sibi boys are especially vitupera-
tive. But a long-drawn-out spell of bad
weather has hit the western islands in the
eye, and the average of shell recovered is
evening up. The islanders fish and man
their own boats, cutters and luggers, and
are very keen as to speed, seaworthiness and
carrying capacity. They are splendid sailors,
and know their intricately-reefed island
waters in and out. Often they sail at night,
navigating their boats by the stars, and keep
an accurate course over the most dangerous
sea in the world. The islanders would be
insulted if you did not class them as Aus-
tralians. They dislike the Japs. Last sea-
son they put £22,000 into their savings
account; this money, won by their own
shelling-boats in their own waters, is help-
ing trade in and around Thursday Island.
The £20,000 won by the Japs last year went
straight to Nippon, hardly the price of a
packet of fags having been spent in an
Australian port.
* * * *
“Gristumas” : When I was taking the cen
sus in a New Britain village the chief lined
up before me his ballet of nine wives. Seven
of them had babies in their arms, and
others children at foot. The chief had aided
me in exploratory work, and we grew
friendly. The day after the census-taking he
came to my camp and shamefacedly con-
fessed that he had deceived me about the
paternity of all the olive branches brought
by his nine wives. “You savvy,” he said,
“place belong me he maiseiei [haunted].
Plenty piccaninny he come up nothing [ille-
gitimately] . Yesterday all Mary she got
piccaninny belong tamboran [sired by a
ghost]. Shame, too much, she like killem.
Me no like. Yesterday me marry ’em eight!”
* * * *
“C. Coral”: The rough spiky skin from
the back of one of the stingray family called
“taimar” by the natives, is an article of
utility in the Torres Strait. When cleaned
and dried it forms an excellent rasp, and is
used as such by the islander for smoothing
up his woodwork, the final “sandpapering”
being done with the leaf of a tree. The taimar
is from two to three feet across, but is not
feared by the native as are some other
varieties of stingray, since he does not carry
a barb in his tail. Coming close inshore on
the sand, he is usually captured at night.
* * * *
“Pfella”: Combing a huge North-Groper-
land district for an absconding nigger I was
accompanied by Sammy, a clever tracker and
a keen follower of the law, as he understood
its functions. Sammy pointed out a
countryman of his, dressed a little better
than the average Binghi, and suggested that
we should detain him on a charge of vag-
rancy. “Good Lord, why?” I demanded.
“Where him get it those good clothes?”
Samuel asked. “Think he stole ’em?”
I countered. “Well, boss,” Sammy ex-
plained, “I know he bin steal one-two
horse from Uro station; I know he bin
steal tent from cherveyor’s camp; I know
ho bin steal dog from Mister Chimpson’s
house; I know he bin steal lubra from
Jacky Tag—oh yes, by cripe, he the proper
pickpocket, boss.”
* & * =s-
“R.L.”: The G'erman who escaped with a
burnt tongue after eating cunjevoi (B.
S/9/’27) evidently had not heard of the
abo. antidote. A small boy of mine picked
a piece of the leaf, and in a few seconds his
tongue was swollen tw T ice its natural size. A
gin who happened to be on the spot, said:
“Missus, gib urn sugar.” In as short a time
as it took the tongue to swell the antidote
reduced it to normal.
* * * *
“Momokeni”: Protection from the sun cer-
tainly does bleach the skin of brown brothers
(B. 27/10/’27), but most of them begin life
as white as Europeans. A newly-born
Papuan baby is quite a light-colored morsel
until exposure to the sun deepens the pig-
ment of the skin to a coffee-brown. In
later life, when the tight-fitting arm and leg
gana§ are cut off. the skin underneath is
nearly white. A bad attack of yaws fre-
quently leaves natives with a piebald skin.
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES.
MRS. NEWLYWED: “You loved me much more when we were engaged. Why have you
changed so?”
MR. NEWLYWED: “To tell you the truth, my dear, I never cared, for married women.”
for the neyv skin formed under the scabs is
unpigmented, and remains a reddish-pink
when the sores heal. One native policeman
whom I saw was the living image of Cliirg-
win, the “White-Eyed Kaffir.” Yaws had
left him with a circular pink patch round
the. right eye, a grotesque disfigurement
which, accompanied by huge pink lips, made
a startling contrast to his otherwise dark
skin.
“Carisbrook, .Tun.” : A full-blooded abo. on
the Mitchell River (Q.) was accidentally
killed in a tribal fight. A week after the
burial his body was for some reason, exhumed.
The black pigmentation had entirely dis-
appeared ; the skin was a pure white. This
possibly may explain the superstition current
in. some tribes that after death an abo.’s
spirit enters the body of a white pfeller.
“Basra”: A family of aborigines living
near Yea (Vic.) turned pale without being
immured in darkness. After recovering
from an illness the old man developed pink
spots in his hands and face. These spots
gradually merged into one another until his
countenance resembled a marble cake. In
six months the black patches had entirely
disappeared. The complaint spread through
the whole family, and when last I saw them
they were every shade of color, from pale-
pink to jet-black.

“Landa”; Who has been stretching
“Ivayeff’s” walking parts (B. 10/11/’27) ?
During the last 12 months two birds only
have been caught on the Nymboida (N.S.W.) ‘
hydro-electric system, both in high-tension
fuse boxes which had an opening small
enough to let a sparrow in. The wires are
too far apart to catch the birds, and in any
case the voltage on the distribution system
is too low to dim the city lights did they
make a short circuit. The flying-fox is
the nuisance; in the season the lines-
men have a morning beat to remove the dead
bodies —not to keep the system clear, but
because the fruit-eater makes his presence
known after death. A dead snake is a rose-
garden compared with a defunct flying-fox on
a hot day.

“Barangkali”: The gecko which jumped
five, inches while stalking its prey on the
ceiling (B. 27/10/'27) must have been having
its lucky day. The stunt is often success-
ful, but they have an unpleasant trick of
falling into the soup or the whisky-and-soda.
The toes of the gecko terminate in adhesive
discs, by the use of which they can run up
walls or windows and across the ceiling.
These discs are soft and elastic; adhesion is
secured by pressing out the air and forming
a vacuum, not by stickiness. When attacked
by birds, the lizard wriggles slightly and
discards its tail, which falls and wriggles,
distracting the pursuers while the gecko
proper runs away. In a few months anew
tail is grown, but quite unlike the original.
The Malays consider it lucky to have a
double-tailed gecko around th.e house. To
secure one’s presence they often break the
tail off half-way and slit the remaining
stump with a knife ; in three months the
much-desired two-tailer is running around
the roof. These lizards devour great num-
bers of insects. The house served plentifully
by them is remarkably free from moths and
mosquitoes.
* *.Js * *
“Toonooba”: There is no mystery about
the goats on barren off-shore islands of the
Barrier Reef lagoon area (B. 3/11/’27). I
have had hundreds of the bleaters under
observation on the rocky, waterless islets of
the Iveppel group. During a good season no
particular hardship is involved, for the her-
bage suffices for Nanny’s modest needs.
During dry spells an existence is eked out by
browsing on the foliage of the stunted
scrub; during protracted dry periods even the
bark is stripped from the wind-twisted
trunks. In common with many drought-
resisters, these scrubby bushes have a
capacity for storing moisture, and this
apparently suffices to keep the goats alive.
It is no uncommon thing to see a flock
threading its dangerous way across cliff-faces
which overlook the sea, in search of blades of
grass or bits of herbage ; regularly, too, the
shore-line is patrolled, for bits of seaweed or
other marine flora are grist for the goats’
mill.
* * * *
“Rose V.”: The blue-fish referred to by
“Mapee” (B. 10/11/’27) does not stick to
Dungowan Creek. I have known it to bs
caught in Carrol’s Creek, about half-way
between Lucknow and Orange. For hooks
the fishermen use needles softened by a heat-
ing process and then bent into the shape of
hooks.
* * * *
“Fitz”: Wliafc is the greatest weight at
which a fr.esh-water perch has turned the
scales? According to local chronicles, Sid
Perrin, of Wingham (N.S.W.), caught a
perch weighing, 1241 b.; and George Robin-
son, also of Wingham, one weighing 91b.
Do fresh-water perch, as some assert, reach
201 b. ?

THE MAN WHO FOLLOWS THE
PLOUGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As the stockman rides from dawn to dusk
His shoulders may slouch and droop,
His legs may bow and his back may bend
Till he sits with a chronic stoop;
The weather may wrinkle and tan his skin
From his scraggy neck to his brow,
But there’s never a man so worn and wan
As he who follows the plough.
The ploughman walks with a weary lurch,
While his pants drag low on his hips;
There’s a crust of dust on his sunburnt arms
And a rim of rime on his lips.
And often his boots are laced with string,
His moles bespattered with oil;
There are knots on the hands and aches
in the feet
Of the man who furrows the soil.
The dairyman fastens the sliprails up
Ere the eastern sky is light,
He is on his feet or the milking seat
Till the shadows fall with the night;
And on the road with his creamy loaf
He’ll tell you life is a “cow.”
But life’s a bellowing mob of them
For him who follows the plough.
The shearer out for the earliest shed
And the man who carries the swag
May drop their loads by the way awhile
And rest, if their footsteps flag.
But the cocky hammers and screws and
sweats,
And mops at his furrowed brow,
And spectres of failure stalk behind
As he trudges after the plough.
And often his ground is hard as a stone,
His horses are hungry and weak,
For grass is all withered and water is low
In the holes of the bone-dry creek.
It has been the same since the world began,
And the world is ancient now.
It was ever the husks that came the way
Of the man who followed the plough.
N.s.w.

“Bayard”: Can any Abo. reader tell me
of a tiger-snake more than 6ft. in length?
I had an idea that I saw. the skin of such a
snake in a bootmaker’s shop window,
Bourke-street, Melbourne, in pre-war days,
that measured 10ft. 4in. On mentioning this
fact to some cobbers I was flatly contra-
dicted and told that no tiger-snake was ever
Oft. long. Eventually I was baited into
betting that 6ft. is not an outsize for this
wriggler. As my good “sugar” is up and
looks like going off, will some expert come
to my rescue?
“C. Coral”: “Bharka?” said the Japanese
diver. “I don’t fright from the sharks. Plenty
time I see him, but so long as I no hit him
lie all right. But whale or diamond-fish. I
don’t like that kind. One time when I diving
I stop down below picking up b§che-de-mer,
and I feel something like big strong tide and
big wave—it knock me one side. When I
look, he got big whale there. That fella he
feed on beche-de-mer fish, and swill the fish
down like man when he haul in his breath.
Those, fish all go down inside his mouth like
nothing, and that strong tide from his mouth
catch me, too. Another time big diamond-
fish, weigh about 10 tons I think, come close
to me when I diving, and feel my air-pipe

TONY: “You give it the job, boss. I good-a the man pusha-a th’ truck.”
CAP'N : “But ’ee do’n’ speak English, boay.”

start run away. But his arm come fast in
the line and haul me and that lugger, and
take us long way. My word, I think we all
going finish that time ! Plenty other thing
I don’t like—big starfish (octopus, you call
him) he no good. I see starfish fight under-
neath water with big snake thick like my
arm: two hour I sit down and watch that
one, very proper fight. But sharka, no, I
not fear of him; and I been diver for 20
year now!”
* * * *
“Yufu”: I agree with “Hamer” (B.
13/10/’27) that the drift to the city isn’t
confined to humans. I live in a thickly-
populated suburb not five miles
from Sydney G.P.O. Last sum-
mer two iories, four honey-
eaters, a catbird, several
thrushes and a small flock of
lovebirds visited us. Probably
the cluster of wattles we have
at the back end of our block
attracted these country visi-
tors ; but I have never seen any
of them so close to the city
before.
* , * *
“Gouger”: The canoes of the
Dauan and Sibi men in full
sail make a picturesque sight.
Though barbarically built, they
are very graceful. Some are
30 feet long, others 40 feet, and
they ride high out of the water,
showing grotesque figureheads
of staring women, alligators or
sharks. The sides are painted
and carved in bold relief with
what at first sight appear to,
be hieroglyphic signs. They
fly before the wind, their out-
riggers like porpoises skimming
the curling waves. With sails
that strain and sing to every
breath of wind, they are won-
derfully fast, and are splendidly
manoeuvred. On. their plat-
forms and inside the vessels
are carried stacks of queerly
miscellaneous cargo; rich tro-
pical fruits and vegetables,
fowls, pigs and turtles, men,
women and children. The natives trade
with the surrounding islands and along por-
tions of the New Guinea coast, from the
canoe-building tribes of which they buy their
craft. The price is generally an armlet shell
of rare variety. In the old days the pur-
chasing medium was a skull.
“Gristumas”: Near Rabaul a district
officer and another official were, unintention-
ally, the means of boosting a form of black
magic known in pidgin-Englisli as “broom
put ’im.” A little earth is scraped off the
track along wdiich the offending person is to
pass; a leaf or other article, over which
an incantation is made by the sorcerer, is
buried in it, and the soil is then carefully
AT 2 AM.
“’Seme me, lady — hie—can you tell me if I'm th’—hic—new boarder?”
replaced. After the victim has walked over
the prepared material he, according to the
sorcerer, will develop sore feet. The district
officer fined some sorcerers who had terror-
ised a village with this “broom put ’im,”
and in an address assured the people that it
was bunkum. The feet of both officers were
chafed that day; sores became septic, and
the victims finished the patrol in bandages
and slippers. “Broom put ’im” is still going
strong in that village.
* * * #
“Pfella” : Sense of smell may be the means
of feathered hunters of woodgrubs locating
their prey (B. 20/10/’27), but I fancy acute
hearing has more to do with it. So, at least,
a nigger offsider told me. He was a daisy
on the job himself; by merely standing still
near a tree-trunk he could always tell where
the nearest bardie worked a passage. Put
to a keener test, he could place his ear at
various parts of the bole _ and give a fairly
correct guess at the number of the grubs
within a given area and how far in you’d
have to cut. He was a whale on tree-grub
tucker; once when I refused to share his
catch lie commented on the fact that I ate
oysters, which fed on more unclean food than
aid bardies.
* * * *
“Ivooragai”: A tenacious fighter is the
greenhead ant, whose sting is venomous
enough to kill any other ant it gets into
grips with. Other ants seem to know it,
and give it room. It has a habit of getting
mixed up among the camper’s blankets at
night, and the pain it causes shoots right
through him. If he can’t find the miscreant
a doubt lingers as to whether it was an ant
or a scorpion. The greenhead also gets
inside one’s clothes with the unobtrusive-
ness of a burglar, and with malice afore-
thought; a sharp, electrifying stab under
cover is the first intimation of its presence.
The resultant search seems to stimulate
it, and the victim comes out of the disagree-
ment with 14 white blisters and a crazy
feeling that doesn’t rub off for an hour.
* * * *
“P.M.”: Re thick trees (B. 20/10/’27).
A big blackbutt in the South Gippsland
hills had the middle of the butt charred out
by a fire. Through the archway thus made
a cream-waggon with a high roof drawn by
five horse—three leaders abreast and two
polers—used to be driven on its round.
* * * *
“Thorno”: The red ant of Siam is the
champion house-builder of the family. These
ants reside in the foliage of trees and con-
struct their communal dwelling by folding
over the leaves in such a manner that they
form a large circular chamber, proof against
tropical dowmpours, birds, lizards and the
like. Recently I saw the whole job in full
swing. While the plasterers were busy
sticking the basement together, the scaf-
fold gang were working on three big stiff
and upright leaves that were to make the
roof. To bend them into position was a
task. From the top of each leaf were hung
two threads, about au inch apart, with cross
threads every half-inch in the form of a
ladder. The making of the ladders seemed
to be skilled work, as only a few ants were
engaged in it. When they were completed,
workers, under the direction of a ganger,
took their places on the rungs of the ladders;
the leaves were bent over, and the roof was
made fast. The house was then ready for
occupation. I don’t know whether the ants
spin their own web for these ladders or
pinch the material from spiders, but] I
belong to the Abo. council and th-e yarn’s
true.
* * * *
“Mei” : Re fish and couch grass suddenly
appearing along bore-drains (B. 3/11/’27).
It is not unusual to find small fish,
up to about 7in. long, in bore-water. They
come up the bore-casing from their hot-
water home thousands of feet below the
surface, and live comfortably enough in
the water near the bore-head, but usually
die if they work far down the drains
where the water is cool. As for the couch
grass, it is probably present somewhere in
the paddock in small quantities. Bits car-
ried in the sheep’s hoofs are tramped off into
the damp soil alongside the bore-drains, and,
finding conditions congenial, soon spread.
* * * *
“Coot”: Is the word “bucker” of Aus-
tralian origin? Its first appearance in print,
so far as I am aware, occurs in “Adventures
in Australia in 1852 and 1853,” by 11.
Berkeley Jones. In a footnote the author
explains: “A ‘bucker’ is a vicious horse, to
be found only in Australia.”
* t- •'£ *
“Manuka”: I have often heard it stated
that there is no true Tasmanian black snake,
the so-called “black” found in the Speck
being, it is alleged, a “tiger.” I recently
killed several “black” snakes on the West
Coast. If they were “tiger” I’m willing to
eat the next one I kill.
¥
“Wandi” : The P. P. Board’s list of noxious
animals keeps on growing. Recently, in a
wild-pig hunt in the Quambone district
(N.S.W.), 500 of the grunters were killed,
and 6d. a scalp was paid. The country there-
abouts has been infested for a good many
years, but hitherto the expense of checking
the pest on any run was borne by the owner.
Thousands were slaughtered on Buttabone,
at a cost of a shilling a scalp. The only
instance I know of the rooters being other-
Avise turned to profit was on the Lachlan
some years ago. A butcher in Hay employed
three men with dogs to capture reed-bed
porkers. The dogs part was to bail up the
pig; then it was lassoed and taken to a yard,
where it was fed on pollard. More than a
hundred were caught in three weeks. They
were carted to Hay, 50 miles distant, and
there fattened. When killed fresh from the
reed-beds the pork was rank, but after sty-
feeding it was reckoned as good food as the
average slaughter-yard pig.
BILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bad-tempered men? Well, I've met a few;
but I reckon ot all the lot
There’s none who can equal Old Bill back
there for a temper that’s really hot.
You ought to have heard him that rainy
night when the horse that lie bought
from Leake /•
Refused to pull when liis cart was bogged in
the middle of Bummers Creek.
By the way he swore and the things he said
you’d have thought that I was to blame,
For he threatened to punch me well and
hard, and called me a nasty name.
And there was no reason that I could see
why he should go off that way.
For the only words that I said to him were
“What did I tell you, eh?”

OAT STORAGE.
“Azac”: Galvanised-iron tanks made out
of 22-gauge corrugated-iron, sufficient to hold
about 500 or 600 bags, will be found just
the thing for growers who decide to hold this
year’s crop over till higher prices are ruling.
Such tanks soon pay for themselves, as they
cost only about £6O each to build, and if two
are erected together on an elevated platform
and covered with a single-gable roof as pro-
tection against weather, the total cost should
not exceed £l2O for the pair. The pair of
silos would hold 3300 bushels, so the original
cost is 9d. per bushel, and as that is often
less than the difference between summer
and winter prices of a bushel of oats, the
initial cost of the silos may be wiped off in
the first year. The roof over the silos is
essential to keep out the weather, as weevils
will not be a nuisance unless there is a
certain amount of. moisture in the stored
grain, and that amount of moisture is greater
than the amount naturally found in the
grain at harvest-time.
If weevils do get in, about 101 b. liquid
carbon bisulphide for every 1000 bushels of
grain in the silo will fix them up. The
liquid fumigant is poured in on top of the
grain in the silo, which should be airtight.
The gas given off is heavier than air, with
the result that it quickly flows down amongst
the grain and kills all weevils. The gas
does not taint the grain, but it is highly
inflammable; so don’t smoke till the job is
finished.
NABAWA WHEAT.
“Granger”: A wheat variety that ought
to interest N.S.W. growers is Nabawa. It’s
a cross between Bunyip and Gluyas Early,
and has had a good trying-out in Westralia,
where it gave good yields. One of its advant-
ages is that so far as present experience
goes it is immune from flag smut. It is a
mid-season to early variety, and an experi-
mental 100-acre plot in the Berrigan
( N.S.W.) district is shaping finely. It is
free of flag smut, though adjoining plots of
other varieties are affected, and is filling up
well with three grains to the spikelet. At
latest estimate it is expected to yield eight
bags to the acre. Federation and Waratah
will have to look to their laurels.
BARLEY-GROWING IN WESTRALIA.
“Groper” : Why don’t Westralian farmers
grow more barley? The climate is suit-
able—very similar to that of California
where most of the world’s brewing-barley is
grown—and barley rotates nicely with wheat.
There’s no doubt about finding a market.
Close at hand is the domestic market, for
W.A. imports each year 20,000 bushels of
two-row Chevalier. The entire Australian
export at present is about 20,000 tons a year,
and that could be multiplied by five without
glutting the oversea market.
The most suitable type of barley for West-
ralian cultivation in my experience is the
Pryor variety of two-row Chevalier. Some
of my neighbors have been experimenting
with the Marloot type of Californian seed,
but British brewers don’t like it, and won’t
buy it if they can help it. Pryor, on the
other hand, is a first-class brewing barley,
grows well even on second-class land, and is
readily saleable. There’s just one tip for
the man who grows for export. Put your
barley in new bags. Oversea buyers won't
look at barley that comes in dirty old sacks.
DECENTRALISED KILLING.
“Almanac”: “Chump Chop” (B. 3/11/’27)
evidently doesn’t know Melbourne conditions
when he advocates decentralised killing. All
roads lead to Melbourne, as is the case in
other Australian cities; a lot of the stock
would have to come there first before being
sent to killing centres, and would be in the
trucks for a much longer period than at pre-
sent ; also a longer overland trek where rail
is out of the question would involve severe
losses, particularly in summer. In the beef
shortage of a few years ago we imported
from Maoriland direct to Sydney and Mel-
bourne thousands of cattle, which speculation
would never have been undertaken • for coun-
try centres. Then there are the regular
supplies from King Island and S. Aus. and
the added cost of distributing such. Another
point against the scheme is the distribution
of wool, hides, fat, horns, hooves and offal,
for you can’t reasonably expect all the pro-
posed country centres to have facilities for
treating these, and the cost of bringing such
to the city would be enormous, and would
more than offset the present stock losses
during transit.
If “Chump Chop” can’t get meat as good
in the city as on the farm he’s unfortunate;
I can, by paying a fair thing for my cut,
and I’ve chewed up a number of beasts on
the farm. At times prime quality stock is
spoilt by rushing them from the snWards
to the killing-pens without resting. Slaugh-
tered in this heated condition beef, mutton or
lamb suffers in flavor and appearance. But
there is grave doubt about getting the Aus-
tralian palate accustomed to chilled meat.
In the last meat shortage a fair amount of
chilled was placed on the local market,
and although the cost was considerably less
than that of fresh meat the latter generally
got preference. The naughty little ways of
the meat retailer account for a lot of the
sniffs that “Chump Chop” complains of and
implies is due to the present city system.
I’m with him in - any practical scheme that
will lessen cruelty to the animals. For a
start, reduce the number of sheep and lambs
now jambed into the pens. Separate the
wild bullocks from the quieter ones in the
saleyards, and, above all, load trucks with a
little commonsense. To give stock too much
or too little room is to look for trouble, and
if after droving them to rail you can give
them a reasonable spell before trucking, the
beasts will market in better condition.
A WORD FOR BABY BEEF.
“Villers-Brett.”: From the breeder’s
point of view feeding baby beef has at least
four advantages over feeding heavy cattle.
(1) Calves and yearlings make 25 to 50
per cent, more meat from the grain con-
sumed than they would do if kept until two
or three years old.
(2) There is a much quicker turnover in
the money invested in breeding cattle when
baby beeves are produced.
(3) An increased number of breeding
cows can be kept if calves and yearlings are
sold.
(4) Heifers more than two years old
often sell at a discount. Finished off as
yearlings they will sell almost as well as
steers.
A CALL FOR CHAMPION MILKERS.
“Milker”: How many cows is it possible
for one individual to milk by hand in an
hour? In my district (Southland, M.L.) a
dozen is reckoned a bit above the average.
What’s the Australian record?
DENMARK’S DAIRY INDUSTRY.
“Ino”: A. H. Renard, in “The ABC
of Scientific Stock Feeding” says: “The
Danes, by employing rape and cotton-seed
oil-cake in feeding their cows, obtain a
quality of butter that commands the highest
price in the English market. True, their
country is close to England, but against
this stands the cost of the oil-cake and other
strong foods, as well as the high cost of
grazing, making feeding very expensive.
However, the value of the skim milk and
manure is equivalent to sd. per lb. (of but-
ter), and they are satisfied to sell their but-
ter at a little over food cost price.”
As the manure is used to grow cow-feed,
the position of the Danish dairyman is that
his return for labor and all other expenses,
other than the cost of cow-feed, is the skim
milk. With all his troubles and alleged
inefficiency the Australian dairy-farmer has
not yet been forced down to the skim milk
level. Scientific feeding with properly bal-
anced rations sounds fine and imposing on
paper, but under present Australian condi-
tions it is an economic impossibility so far
as butter production is concerned. Stud
breeders have to hand-feed the cows they
submit to the official test or they’d be no-
where, but many of them only feed concen-
trates for a few days before each monthly
test and thus obtain credit for high produc-
tion without incurring the heavy cost of con-
stant hand-feeding.
Politicians and Government experts cannot
speak or write about dairying without tell-
ing us to “look at Denmark” ; but I notice
that none of our critics suggest that their
remuneration should be fixed on the Danish
scale, or that Australia should adopt Den-
mark’s policy of F r eetrade, low wages and
low standard of living.
As to Denmark’s prosperity, in 1924 she
had more than ±112,000,000 of rural mort-
gages ; no light load for less than 9,000,000
acres of poor land to carry.
In a recent article Philip Snowden said:
“Denmark has the largest percentage of un-
employed of any country in Europe. The
development of its natural resources has
not given the country a prosperous home
market.”
HOW SUKEY DIED.
“St. Rawberry”: I have lately had one or
two cases of premature calving amongst the
milkers, which I attribute to the droughty
conditions prevailing in this (Singleton,
N.S.W.) district. One case that I at first
thought to be just such a miscarriage proved,
on closer inspection, to be otherwise. A
little Sherlock Holmesing has evolved the
following theory, interesting if true.
Sukey, though small for her age when
born, had a fine sharp pair of incisor teeth;
instinct led her to the right end of ma, and
she got a secure hold on the bottle. Unluckily
she nibbled, and the outraged mother un-
leashed a hoof that had killed many a rabbit
and laid out her daughter for keeps. The
calf fell in a normal position, and the only
clues I had were the facts that old Brindle’s
offside forward teat was (is to my sorrow!)
badly lacerated channelwise and downtoards,
to fit the calf’s teeth, indicating a down-
ward wrench, and that the calf had been
cleaned on both sides, showing that it must
have lived and stood. The neck was not
broken, so -I surmise concussion.
Anyway, the old girl stands convicted of
infanticide on the voice of a local jury.
THE PRICKLY-PEAR PROBLEM.
“Azac” : The recent drought in the prickly-
pear areas of N.S.W. has revived the old
question as to the value of the pear as feed
for stock. Some graziers are emphatic that
pear, on good country, will not only keep
cattle in condition but actually fatten them.
I disagree. For one thing, the pear causes
inflammation of the mouth even when all
the spines are singed off before being fed.
The graziers’ championing of prickly-pear
as a fodder is the result of want of close
observation. Prickly-pear that will allow
room for cattle to graze amongst it also
gives room for grass to grow in between the
clumps. The pear not only shelters the
grasses and herbage from drying winds, but
to some extent prevents evaporation of the
moisture that does fall. Under such con-
ditions grasses and other fodder plants grow
luxuriantly, and it is on these that the
cattle live more than on the pear, though the
pear collects the kudos.
It is no argument to say that badly-
infested prickly-pear country has no bare
patches on which grass can grow. Such land
does not run cattle.
Notwithstanding that the pest now covers
over 23 million acres and is spreading at the
rate of two acres a minute, the problem of
clearing infested land has been solved for
some considerable time now. The worst pear
country can be cleared by spraying with
arsenic pentoxide, whilst there are four or
five parasitic insects that are doing wonder-
ful work in the North-West of N.S.W. How-
ever, the insects are slow, if sure, and the
cost of spraying is often more than the land
is worth when cleared. To kill pear with
arsenical sprays costs about £4 per acre,
for which price good grazing land can be
purchased in districts where prickly-pear
is unknown.
The prickly-pear problem, therefore, is not
one of methods but of costs, and the only
way apparently to reduce the costs of clear-
ing the pest is to find some commercial use
for the pear, the returns from which will
offset some of the expenses of destruction.
Some shrewd farmers in the North-West
are purchasing badly-infested pear country
for next to nothing, and are introducing into
it the cochineal and other parasitic insects,
which they anticipate will clear out the pear
in time for their children to make use of
the land. The pear has taken 50 years or
more to gain the footing it now has, and
even if the insects take that number of years
to clear it out, no one will deny that they
have done good work.
IN PRAISE OF THE DORRIGO.
“Yufu” : The time is not far off when the
Dorrigo plateau is going to be recognised
as the show place of dairies and mixed farms
of N.S.W. Especially the eastern plateau.
This latter portion, abundantly watered by
three main rivers and numerous tributaries,
still contains thousands of acres of virgin
scrublands awaiting selectors. Most of the
timber is softwood, which, when fallen and
burned, will rot itself away in a few years,
and the soil is either red or chocolate loam,
with not the slightest trace of clay.
The rainfall of the district is anything
between 70 and 150 inches per annum, but
floods are few and far between on account
of the ideal getaways. Natural grasses cover
all the cleared lands. A spur railway-line
runs through the district from Glenreagh to
Top Dorrigo, and other lines have been pro-
posed ; the Gorge hydro-electric plant is
practically in the heart of the eastern
plateau. There are two or three sawmills at
every township, cutting, at present, only pine
—a timber with which the district abounds.
Working dairies at present average as
much as £2 ss. a cow —an average that
takes some beating. But apples seem to be
the long-suit. They thrive on the slopes,
the trees bearing large, well-flavored truit
abundantly, and they are not bothered wiJi
codlin. Deciduous fruit seem to be immune
from the fly also. Corn, oats, potatoes and
other farm-products yield splendid crops.
As the Dorrigo is high up, the tempera-
ture is ideal—not too hot and not too cold.
But it is cold enough to assure the success
of English plums and cherries. In fact, of
all our coastlands, I think the Dorrigo is
most attractive from a dairying point or
view, and intending selectors would do well
to survey it before settling down.
A NEW THEORY OF SOIL MOISTURE.
“Yabbie” : Director West, the Australian-
born head of the Commonwealth Citrus
Research Station, Griffith (N.S.W.), recently
read a paper to the local Research Bureau
setting out the revolutionary theory that cul-
tivation does not conserve soil moisture.
Roughly, the theory is that any given soil
has a fixed hydrostatic moisture content
termed its “field Capacity.” excess over
field capacity, being “free water,” is quickly
lost by drainage or evaporation, or by both.
Once the excess water is so lost the field
capacity remains practically static. It has
been taught hitherto that the mulch caused
by cultivation acted as a kind of lid and con-
served soil moisture by preventing evapo-
ration due to capillary action. Of course,
weeds expire enormous quantities of soil
moisture, and if thick enough may reduce
field capacity to a practically bone-dry con-
dition. The principal object of cultivation,
therefore, from the standpoint of this daring
theory, is weed-slaying, and, following this
line, no useful purpose can be served by cul-
tivating clean fallow.
Shortly after West’s paper was published
news came from California that a research
station there had been experimenting on the
same lines and had evolved the same start-
ling theory.
SURVEYING DRAINAGE SYSTEMS.
“Vinciinus”: I want to save landowners
expense by correcting “Larrapinta’s” state-
ment (B. 13/10/’27) that “only with a theo-
dolite can one lay out a gradual fall (such
as two feet in a mile) accurately.” He
discounts the value of his own statement
by admitting that qualified surveyors have
made mistakes in laying out drainage sys-
tems.
A theodolite should be used for the pre-
liminary location of a drain or irrigation
channel if there is only a small fall obtain-
able, and the final setting out should be done
with a chain and accurately-adjusted level
or gradienter.
I agree with “Larrapinta” in his advice
that it pays to employ a qualified man, and
laying out bore-drains is not the only instance
where such advice applies. A large propor-
tion of Australia’s inability to meet foreign
competition is owing to unqualified or half-
qualified men being in charge of under-
takings of all kinds. Our standard of
living is so high for laborers, _ and laborers
are so numerous, that what is left of the
proceeds of industry after the laborer has
got his cut is not sufficient to remunerate
qualified men.
HOW BUSH-FIRES START.
“Homfrey Beale”: Does “P.M.” (B.
10/11/’27) really believe that men ride
round the country on bicycles or in motor-
cars starting fires as a means of livelihood?
There are very few “habitual fire-fighters”
these days. I knew a few men in the old
days, when scrubs were thicker and precau-
tions less, and fires consequently more fre-
quent and harder to control, who made fire-
fighting their principal occupation ; but they
were all horny-handed, golden-hearted bush-
men, the last people on earth to descend to
mischievous incendiarism. They fought a
fire just as enthusiastically when there was
no pay coming to them as when it was, and
the same spirit animates practically all men
who travel and know the bush to-day. Most
fire-fighting to-day is done by bands of
cockies and their sons, assisted by organised
volunteers from adjacent towns and cities.
So rarely is an outsider engaged on wages
that it would not pay an incendiary to go to
the trouble and risk of starting a bush-fire.
I, as well as “P.M.,” have “put in a good
few years in timbered country,” and, in
common with most bushmen, I know that
the most prolific cause of bush-fires is burn-
ing roots (they burn underground for
months sometimes), and the action of the
sun on glass. The throwing away of bottles
is a well-known cause, and most _ land-
owners nowadays give instructions against it.
MISDESCRIBING WOOL.

start mixing up his'cash, putting the fivers
and tenners among the quids and handing
them over the counter in that way, he would

bank a pretty penny as well. But it never
seems to occur to the woolgrower or nis
servant that lie is risking proportionate loss
by the manner in which he misbrands his
bales or misdescribes them on his waybills.
It is true that most of the errors are found
out, but as often as not it is as much by
good luck as good management, and not the
growers’ good management at that.
It costs the Sydney woolbrokers £IU,UUU
to £15,000 a year to detect and rectify errors,
but still a good number slip through so
much so that special claims arrangements
are made with various countries in order that
the purchaser may recover his money on an
inferior hale delivered to him owing to a
misdescription. But one can be sure that
the purchaser has nothing to say when he
receives a superior bale delivered to lum tor
the same reason.
A bale of wool is roughly worth £2O on an
average, but some are worth £25, and some
only £l5. Surely it is worth a bit of trouble
to see that the £25 bale is not sold for xlo.
PINEAPPLES v. BANANAS.
“Cleveland”: Farmers on the North Coast
of New South Wales would be advised to
consider carefully before adopting the advice
of “Cog” (B. 27/10/’27) to replant their •
banana plantations with pineapples. Every
year the markets in Sydney and Melbourne
are glutted with the fruit when the summer
crop is harvested, and the grower instead or
receiving Bs. to 9s. a case is forced to sell
the major portion of his output to the can-
ners for less than half those rates.
The ill-fated soldiers’ settlement at Beer-
burrum (Q.) demonstrated that it was an
easy matter to flood the Australian markets
and reduce the price a long way below a
payable figure. The greater portion of the
best land on the Tweed, being on the hill-
sides, would not lend itself to horse cultiva-
tion, and nowhere in the world are pine-
apples produced entirely by handwork.
COMBATING THE SUCKING-MOTH.
“J.H.S.”: This is how the sucking-moth,
a nocturnal pest that in some seasons de-
stroys the greater part of the forward orange
crop, is combated on the Bananaland coast.
Armed with a strong light, generally a
bicycle-lamp, and, when the trees are tall,
with a butterfly-net attached to a long rod,
growers enter the orchard as soon as it is
dark and search from tree to tree for the
moths, which with a little practice can
readily be located. The pests are caught
by hand if low down, and by means of the
net if high up, and despatched by tearing
off their heads. In one night an active
person, when the pest has been very bad
(as was the case this season), has been
known to destroy as many as 700 of the
suckers, and in the course of a season thou-
sands are accounted for. The practice is to
go round the trees late in the afternoon and
set up baits (fruit already pierced and
fallen) at a handy height, the moths pre-
ferring a fruit already pierced, and par-
ticularly the riper fruit, which is the first
to be attacked and the first to fall. The
handsome depredators don’t mind how often
an orange has been fed from or how “over-
ripe” it may be, but will suck at it so long
as there is juice to be extracted.
Good results are sometimes obtained by
poisoning the baits, but there is always a
risk of destroying poultry as well as use-
ful insect-eating birds. A good light is
essential, as the moths must be dazzled,
otherwise they will fly off on being
approached closely enough to be caught. Tlie
killing must go on regularly night after
night, beginning early and continuing until
the last moth has been caught or driven from
the orchard.
On the coast of Central Queensland the
suckers usually make their appearance to-
wards the end of February, when the fruit
is still green, but well-grown and juicy, and
keep going well into June. One night’s kill-
ing is useless, as succeeding batches hatch
out day by day, and the night following a
big kill is likely to see as many of the
ravagers about as before. The Bananaland
moth (there are at least three varieties) may
be known by its having much yellow on
the secondary wings, the under surface of
the outer wing being also marked with yel-
low. Another distinguishing feature is a
growth of sharp spikes on the back legs,
which can inflict a disagreeable but harmless
prick.
CURING REARING HORSES.
“Bad Australian”: The cure for a rearing
horse recommended by “Homby” (B.
10/11/’27) is more picturesque than prac-
tical. It would require a clever rider of
unerring judgment and as quick on the get-
away as a cat to break a bottle over the
head of a saddle-horse, and he would need
a coat of mail to protect him from the re-
sultant shower of shattered glass. Also in
the not improbable event of the nag going
down under him with a fractured skull, other
disagreeable complications would ensue. The
top of a horse’s head is not protected by
a thick solid cap of bone ; on the contrary,
it is so thin that I have seen a colt killed
by a tap between the ears with a whip-
handle. It would appear to be difficult, if
not impossible, to apply the cure to a horse
that has developed a habit of rearing in
harness.
ROUP IN FOWLS.
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: In this changeable
weather fowls are very susceptible to colds,
which if neglected may develop into roup. As
soon as the first signs of roup or colds appear
(a good indication is the tendency to run at
the nose) steps should be taken to prevent
the disease spreading, by putting a reliable
roup powder in the water, and keeping the
fowls out of draughty coops. They should
be fed on warm foods, with plenty of
nourishment in them. Roupy birds, the dis-
ease being infectious, should be isolated from
the rest of the flock, whose water should be
tinted a light pink by the addition of a few
grains of Condy’s crystals. Should a cheesy
substance appear on the beak of the affected
bird, it should 1 be rubbed off and a little sul-
phate of zinc applied to the affected part.
EGG-LAYING RECORDS.
“Geef”: Isn’t “Villers-Brett” (B.
20/10/’27) a bit mixed about his egg
records? Queensland claims the world’s
laying record with the score of 354 eggs
made by R. Burns’s Black Orp. in the
Darling Downs egg-laying competition
concluded on March 31 last. The test ex-
tended over 365 days, and the previous recog-
nised record was by a White Leghorn of
Vancouver (8.C.) with 351 eggs. The M.L.
duck “Villers-Bret.” refers to hails from
Christchurch and laid 363 eggs. A 365
egg record was put up by a duck owned by
McCracken and Mathers at Geelong (Vic.)
this year. It would be interesting to know
when and where “Viller’s-Brett.’s” Yankee
bird did her little turn, and whether the
figures are official —as ours are.
FOUL-BROOD IN BEES.
“Orn” : Both “Larrapinta” (B. 22/9/’27)
and “Pick” (B. 27/10/’27) are quite unneces-
sarily drastic in advocating the destruction of
hives when dealing with foul-brood. If the
old “box” hives are used, then such measures
are certainly necessary, but the “box” hives,
with their tangled combs, making inspection
impossible, should be consigned to the flames,
whether diseased or not. They are merely
nurseries for microbes and tokens of the
ignorance of their owners. McEvoy, the
American pioneer in the modern treatment
of the disease, asserts that “it is not even
necessary to disinfect the hives.” Shaking
the bees off the old combs on to frames with
small strips of foundation, and treating the
old frames and hives with boiling water and
carbolic, gives a cure with far less chance
of recrudescence than there is of outside
infection in any ordinary district where the
disease exists. The treatment should be done
in the evening and with all possible speed,
since it is the honey that carries the germs,
and if bees from other hives are allowed to
rob, the cure of one hive may infect many.
The professional beekeeper who attends to
his hives has little fear of this disease; it is
the casual amateur with the old kero.-caSes
who is a curse to himself and his neighbors.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Bill R.” : Strips of hessian, twine and a
packing-needle should be in the saddle-bag
kit of every boundary-rider and musterer.
The legs of sheep are notoriously easy to
break. Every day fractures happen in the
flock when the animals gambol about steep
banks, wander among rock crevices or plunge
through fallen timber. The drovers’ pro-
cedure when such mishap occurs is usually
an immediate application of the sheath-knife
and spread of a sheepskin on the adjoining
fence. But handy strips of bark, stout
thistle-stalks or splinters of wood bound with
the hessian and securely sewn around the
break will hold the limb from swinging,
prevent the resultant mortification and
ensure one more woolly for penning at shear-
ing-time.
“Lily-Beale” : To cure fowls of scaly leg,
dress the feet and shanks well with wood
preserving oil, otherwise known as blue oil.
If this is not obtainable, rub in a mixture
of equal parts of kerosene and any sweet
oil or vaseline, being careful not to touch
the tender skin under the feathers.
“Fred Rich”: A sure way to get rid of
blackberry is to burn it out while the ground
is wet. Wait until mid-summer, thrash the
bushes down and pile plenty of dry branches
on them to ensure a hot fire. The steam in
the wet ground will kill the roots right out.
In cases where plants are small and isolated
they may be taken out with a butcher’s
knife. Take the plant right out, cover up
the hole and stamp the ground firmly, the
object being to smother the root.
“Sabbas” : I notice some of your readers
are troubled with distemper among their dogs.
I have found for many years that a little
potato in their diet is a preventive. Masheu
potatoes in milk or dripping, or water of
boiled potatoes, should be added to their
milk in small quantities, say at least once a
week, until the animals are a year or even
two years old.
“Nota Bene” : Re brine for corning meat
(“F.5.H.,” B. 27/10/’27). If a little salt-
petre, say, 4oz. to fcwt. coarse salt, is added,
it will be found an improvement and will
impart color to the meat. Otherwise the
recipe is the correct one. In big works
fresh brine is rarely made, the old being
reboiled and skimmed as described by
“F. 5.11.” When Hutton’s, of Ballarat,
moved their works some years ago they took
the old brine with them.
“Yufu” : Better than wasting your, corn-
cobs by burning them in the stove (B.
27/10/’27) is to heap them round the butts
of your fruit-trees. They take a long time
to rot into manure, but whilst they are
doing so they are keeping the ground warm
and moist. A North .Coast (N.S.W.) farmer
has been using his cobs about his orange-
trees for the last 20 years, and he has the
best fruit in the district.
“Yufu”: To prune tomatoes, nip off all
the side shoots that come out and send your
plant up on the single stem. In this way the
fruit comes on from the bottom to the top,
the bottom lot ripening first and so on up to
the last bunch. Another way is to train
the plant on the single stem for 18 inches
and then let it shoot out in three or four
branches. But whichever way you grow,
never allow any leaves on the plant close to
the ground, as the steam arising from them
rotting on the ground causes black-rot and
other complaints to ruin your crop. A little
artificial manure mulched in at the foot of
the plant when the fruit is half-grown will
give flavor and size.
“P.P.W.”: To kill suckers growing from
stumps, mix one part of S.O.S. to two parts
of water. If a stump is eight or nine inches
in diameter split it with an axe at the middle
to a depth of four to six inches, and dribble
slowly into the crack about two tablespoon-
fuls of the' mixture, making sure that it soaks
in. For a larger stump split it twice or
more, about four inches in from the edge, and
proceed as above. The best way is to use
a steel wedge six to eight inches long, two
inches wide and fin. thick at the big end.
with a groove down the middle fin. wide
beginning about three inches down from the
big end. Drive this into the stump and
dribble the mixture down the hollow of the
wedge and then remove the wedge. The
suckers will die in a week or so. S.O.S costs
21s. 2d. per five-gallon drum, and six doses
cost only a penny.

JOURNALISM (1927).
From the Daily Lion, Monday:—
A terrible state of affairs is expected to be revealed
concerning a school —one of the leading seminaries
for young ladies at Fitzrooloo, kept by a Miss
Drabble. On some nights, according to local resi-
dents, not two p.c. of the boarders are to be found
in their beds. Only recently a man of dubious
appearance was seen to drive away with a pretty
fair-haired student despite the protests of the head-
mistress, who appears to have completely lost
control.
From the Daily Lion, Tuesday:—
The public is unanimously demanding an inquiry
into the Drabble scandal. In the House yesterday
afternoon, Mr. Blather moved for a Royal Commis-
sion to cover all the schools in the metropolis.
From the Daily Lion, Wednesday:—
In an interview, Dr. Almroth Rong, the noted
specialist, remarked that conditions similar to the
Drabble case were widespread in America. The
consequences were serious. Out of 100 girls ex-
amined at various schools, 40 had defective vision,
53 had post-nasal growths and only 10 had perfect
teeth. He was convinced that similar results would
be forthcoming in Australia. There should be more
medical supervision.
From the Daily Lion, Thursday:—
The Editor, Dear Sir, —What is the country com-
ing to? Serried phalanxes of motor-cars and taxis,
crammed with leering old satyrs, lined up outside
every girls’ school in the country! Your courageous
exposure earns the thanks of all right-thinking
people.
From the Daily Lion, Friday:—
In an address to delegates of child-reform associa-
tions last evening, the Rev. Nahum Judjud gave it
as his opinion that the wholesale debauching of the
young people of this country was directly due to
the secular system of education.
By beam wireless to all papers, Saturday:
Geneva, Thursday.—At to-day’s session, Herr Sch-
mallcoin, the German delegate, moved to ask the
Council of the League whether, in view of the
revelations concerning her educational system, Aus-
tralia was a fit country to be entrusted with the
New Guinea mandate.
From the Morning Damper, Monday:—
Asked whether there was any truth in allegations
made by a certain newspaper, Miss Drabble, of
Fitzrooloo, stated that her establishment was not
a boarding-school but a day kindergarten for children
under 12. She remembered a man in a motor-car
calling on a recent afternoon and taking a pupil
NON-COMMITTAL.
“Well, of all the nerve! Turning up with
a black eye and sticking-plaster! What
happened?”
“Oh, had a blow-out last night!”
to the pictures. She did not believe in children
attending the cinema during school hours, but she
was not in a position to refuse, as the person men-
tioned was the child’s father.
From the Daily Lion, Tuesday:—
The filthy, disgusting, insanitary, dirty and offen-
sive condition of the kennels in which many Pomer-
anian dogs are kept in this city is a matter of
vital concern to the community. The pleasing appear-
ance of these pets of wealthy, leisured women when
they are seen in public is not a true....

Once Mary had a little lamb
Whose fleece was white as snow,
Some toys and dolls, a little pram—
Then she was nice to know.
But since we’ve had the cinema,
As soon as infants walk
They boldly cheek both ma and pa
And “butt in” when we talk.
Alas! there are no children now;
Young Mary paints and smokes,
Whilst kindergarten kids, I vow,
Are reading Marie Stopes.
Sometimes along a city street
Ahead of us we see
A flapper trim and sweetly neat—
But aged quite sixty-three.

I saw her walking down the street;
Her face was fair, her figure neat,
And for whole days I could not eat,
For she w T as on my mind.
They introduced us at a dance.
At last had come my longed-for chance,
And what cared I for envious glance?
For she was on my arm.
I called one evening after that,
And when ’twas time to get my hat
I could not rise from where I sat,
For she was on my knee.
But since has come a sad surprise:
I see her now with other eyes—
Oh, would that it were otherwise,
For she is on my hands!

As she husked the golden corn;
She smirked at him and giggled,
Then coyly said, “Go orn!”
He vowed that lie had loved her,
Since the day that she was born;
She went on milking Poley,
And still replied, “Go orn!”
He pressed her to him closely
At the cowbails in the morn ;
She dumped the milk-pail on the straw
And gurgled, Oh, go orn!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JUST the usual finish; the same old call
to the manager’s office, the pay envelope
thrust in his hand, a few curt words
and Ikey Marcovitz was fired again.
Marcovitz was a machinist; he was gone
in the chest, was going in the legs, but was
not entirely missing in the pocket. He pos-
sessed twenty pounds. The Savings Bank
held his money and Jacob Abelson, his only
friend, who had the large job-goods store in
George-street West, kept the book. Ikey
imagined some benefit was attached to its
custody and levied interest thereon. Jacob
humored him and gave him at times a pair
of boots or a second-hand coat worth little
to himself, but which made Ikey look decent
enough to seek work. Stray meals at Anna
Abelson’s table helped to keep life in his
frail body.
For years Ikey had scraped and toiled to
save enough to bring his parents from
barren Gravodsco to the fulness of Aus-
tralia, but every time his account had looked
big enough to justify inquiries as to pass-
ports and fares and the deposit on a couple
of rooms of furniture, his work had slack-
ened and he had been put off. At his best,
Ikey was no wizard at the machine. Now-
adays, hampered by failing health, he could
not make up his time-card. From the hour
he was taken on in a press of work his
employers were considering the first moment
they could sack him. His last job had pro-
mised constant employment for at least two
months; yet after a bare fortnight he was
again paid off. Hitherto he had never been
in such low water, but lie had contrived to
stem lr's sinking funds at the £2O-mark;
but now, with the slack time coming on, he
had little hope of getting another job. What
he had in his pocket would last one or two
weeks. After? His savings would go, and
he would never see his father and mother
again.
He left the factory and slouched despond-
ently along the streets, then stopped for a
breather outside the store of a tobacconist
and newsagent—a bright little spot, the
windows blooming with all the Flora and
Fina pertaining to the trade. It was warm
in the sun and the rail provided a rest.
Ikey did not hurry away. A young man
came to the door and looked at him; but
he had a kind face, not a bit like a foreman.
A few customers came and went. One was
laughing as at a great joke. “Good on you,
Stepper,” he called to the nice-looking young
man.
“Vot an easy vay of making a living!”
thought Ikey. “You push som packet over
and dey push der money back, and dat’s all
'dere is to it.”
The sun still shone. Ikey turned and
warmed the other side. The young man
called Stepper came out again.
“Hello, still here!” he exclaimed. “Can’t
make up your mind between Havanas and
:Cubans? Come inside, Ikey; I might find
you a Capstan.”
Marcovitz caught the packet Stepper
threw at him, but did not open it—smoking
made him cough. “How did you know my
•name vos Ikey?” he asked.
“What else could it be?” Stepper an-
swered.
Ikey looked round the shop with its neat
fittings and gay advertisements of lovely
ladies smoking Turkish cigarettes.
“Dis is a shoin place,” he said enviously;
“a man should be happy here.”
“He should, Ikey; he should. But all’s
: not Goldflake that glitters.”
“Veil,” said Ikey reluctantly, “I must be
going. But I’ll com und see you som other
time.”
“I won’t be here some other time.”
“No, vy?”
“There are strong, very strong reasons why
I must quit this ten-by-twelve paradise.”
“You are tinking of selling?”
“I wasn’t; but it’s quite a good, idea.”
“You vant a lot of money, eh?”
“Marvellous intuition. I do want a lot of
money.”
“Von hondred pounds, perhaps?”
“About that. But why this idle curi-
osity?”
Ikey hadn’t the slightest hope of buying,
but he played with the idea as a down-and-
out might with the thought of driving his
own car. “I haven’t von hondred pounds,”
he confided.
“Don’t swear it; I’ll believe you without.”
“I’ve only got twenty.”
“You have, have you! Twenty Jimmy—
here, hand over those fags; you’ve got them
under false pretences.”
“Did I ask for dem?” Ikey said with a
shrug.
“Twenty quid!” mused Stepper. “Twenty
quid! Perhaps we can make a deal. I
gather you would like to buy this store.”
“Me buy, Mister,” stammered Ikey. “How
corne ?”
“It comes this way. You look an honest
chap. Suppose I take the twenty down and
you pay me the balance over an indetermi-
nate period. Could you do it?”
Ikey didn’t quite understand the terms,
but be was certain he could do , it.
“Sure you got the twenty?”
“Yes, yes,” said Ikey breathlessly; “I
vill bring der book.”
“Never mind ‘der book,’ bring ‘der oof.’
And keep a tight mouth or the deal is off.
Savvy?”
Ikey savvied and in less than an hour was
back.
Stepper pocketed the cash. “You can
now take possession,” he declared. “Hence-
forth you are monarch of the Monopoles,
and captain of the Capstans.”
Although half-dazed by the miracle vouch-
safed him, Ikey knew business is not trans-
acted so summarily, and he wanted a receipt
—some proof of his title to this little gold-
mine. “I should liaf a paper,” he protested.
“Sure, there they are —morning papers,
evening papers, cigarette papers. Have the
lot.”
“A paper to show I haf paid you money.”
“Who wants to see it? You walk in, I
walk out.”
“You might valk back.”
“Not me! You don’t know me!”
But Marcovitz held to his right to a paper.
“Throw over that writing-pad. Now
what’s your name?”
“Itzik.”
“Eh?”
“Yes, dat’s it. Ikey is my Cher-istian
name.”
So Ikey received a paper and spelt out
laboriously the statement that Itzik Mar-
covitz had purchased the lease of the lock-up
shop situated at 13 Cotton-street for one
hundred pounds (£100), paying twenty
pounds (£2O) deposit. Stock at valuation.
The document was signed “George Windsor.”
IT WAS MADAME THAT WAS'WRONG.
CLIENT: “Of course, you must alter it to fit my figure.”
MARCELLE ET CIE: “But it is of ze imposseeble that Madame demands! It is ze figure
of Madame that must be altered to fit ze robe!”
“I seem to have heard dat name, but I
don’t know it for yours. But, say, rot's
dis valuation?”
“The most the buyer will give and the
least the seller will take.”
It was now a quiet time at the store and
no rush of custom had interfered with the
brief transaction. After appropriating the
contents of the cash register, Stepper
directed Ikey to get a flask of whisky and
a bottle of sodawater “to wet the transfer.”
“But I don’t drink,” objected Ikey.
“Nor eat, either, by the look of you. Well,
go and get a sodawater. While you’re
gone I’ll do the stocktaking.”
When Marcovitz came back Stepper had
his hat and coat on. He swallowed a double-
header of whisky and soda, and, taking up a
large kitbag, walked to the doorway.
“Vot about dat valuation?” Ikey inquired.
“I’ll let you know next time I’m round.”
“And vere you going, Mister?”
Stepper glanced at the movie poster across
the road. “I am going,” he quoted, “where
men are free and women are fierce —no,
fair.”
“No voman troubles me,” quoth Ikey.
“You don’t say. But a man might. Itzik,
my boy, I’ll give you a tip worth more than
your lease. If a dark man with a knife
comes across your path, don’t stop to argue
—get!”
“Mersliugger!” murmured Ikey.
“Good Shobbas !” called Stepper.
Ikey never saw him again.
The warm glow of opulence that enveloped
Ikey as he served the Sun or News was
hardly chilled by the discovery that only a
thin strata at the top of the pile was cur-
rent ; the rest, like himself, were out of
date. Gold lettering across the fixtures on
the wall told the brand of cigarettes to be
found therein. Empty titles. Remembering
the kitbag, Ikey realised the nature of Step-
per’s “stocktaking.”
Still, his golden day remained untarnished.
“Dere vasn’t so much stock; but no matter
—efery penny ve vill turn over till it vorks
up again.” It wouldn’t take so long and—
comforting thought—crooked seams and
baggy linings would trouble him no more.
His mudder and fader should come over, not
steerage, but second-class—mit stewards to
bring ’em basins.
He touched the switch and was going to
enjoy the sight of his windows all lit up,
when a large, fierce Italian rushed in. The
narrow lane between the counters allowing
only a one-way traffic, the two collided, and
Ikey was sent spinning. The Messenger of
Death could scarcely have been a more terri-
fying sight to poor Ikey. His face a mask
of bandages, only two angry eyes showing,
the Italian advanced on him threateningly.
“What you-a doing in-a mine shop?” he
shouted.
“My shop!” gasped Ikey, and clung to the
coupter.
As easily as picking off a cockroach, Ikey
was prised from his holding and deposited
most ungently on the footpath. Having no
knife handy, the Italian was proceeding to
put in the boot, when P.-C. Sargood inter-
vened. A boy had rushed round to lnm with
the news that Joe Altona was killing some-
body again, and, knowing his man, Sargood
lost no time. He pushed Ikey behind one
counter and Altona behind the other, and,
ordering the crowd out of the shop, closed
the door. He was only a young constable,
but forceful.
To Ikey his presence was an assurance of
protection and a guarantee of redress. With
their faces nearly meeting the two men
leaned over and exchanged greetings.
“Porca!” roared Altona.
“Mornzer!” squeaked Ikej.
“Dadroua”.... “(10n0v”.... “Maladetta”
.... “Meesmershimma.”
“Ah, come down to English and let’s get
the strength of this,” said the constable.
Sorted out by P.-C. Sargood, there were the
facts. Joe Altona, the proprietor of the
tobacco store, had the day before got into a
dispute with his brother-in-law, and such
was the force of the arguments used that
Joe had been hurried away to the hospital,
where he was detained while his features
were joined on again. Stepper, being in
the shop at the time of the altercation,
appointed himself trustee till Joe came back.
Harboring grave misdoubts of Stepper’s ad-
ministration, Joe had discharged himself and
reported at the store in his usual manner.
Ikey told the tale of the transfer and
showed the Savings Bank book, with the
account drawn that day, and produced Step-
per’s “receipt” to prove his bona fides. P.-C.
Sargood gave as his considered opinion that
there’s one born every day, “and as to that
bit of paper, you can wipe your boots on it.”
A yell came from Altona. “Where is all
ma stock, ma Stinkadoras, ma iv’ry cig’rette-
hoiders, da silver-mounted” lie pointed
to Ikey. “Dat tief has got dem!”
“Whbre?” asked the constable, looking
round.
“On lieem !”
“Have a bit of sense. That bag-o’-boncs
couldn’t conceal a match. Stepper’s planted
them, I expect.” He turned to Ikey. “Got
any clue where he’s gone?”
“He say lie vos going vere men ver fierce
and vomen free.”
“Surry Hills,” said Sargood, P.-C.
Marcovitz took his trouble to his only
friends, and a week later Anna Abelson
went the round of her acquaintance with a
subscription-paper and a fountain-pen. On
her way she met her friend Bena Rosen.
“Do you know Ikey Marcovitz?”
Bena could not claim the honor.
“Well, he is a very sober, hard-working
fellow, and he slaved and slaved at the
machine, didn’t give himself no sort of a time,
and lived on the smell of a pickled herring,
so he could get together a bit of money to
bring his old people over here.”
“Yot a good son!”
“May you and me have so good!” agreed
Anna. “And when he’d saved up a bit his
chest went back on him and he wasn’t much
good any more at machining. One day last
week he came in so excited and asked for
his bank-book. Jacob, thinking he had p’raps
another half-crown to put in, gave it to him
and, being busy, asked no questions. But
it seems he bought a tobacco shop and only
a few hours after a great Dago comes in
and says it’s his and half-kills poor Ikey. The
man Ikey bought it of was only minding it
while the Dago was in hospital. So there
was Ikey out on his ear, as they say.”
“Yot a shermiel!”
“But I thought of the widow Finkelstein,
who has a nice fish and chips business not
so far from this tobacco shop, and seeing she
has to pay for someone to go to market for
her in the mornings, a husband she should
have or be robbed right and left.”
“Yes,” agreed Bena. “Better a husband
den be robbed by strangers.”
“So when Ikey’s nose went down a bit,
Jacob and der widow made up the match
between them. She will take Ikey without
a penny, but won’t start right away to buy
his clothes, which is only in reason, so
we are making up money to give him
so many suits and boots and this and
that. Perhaps, Bena, you would like to
give something?”
“Veil, put me down for ten shillun.”
Bena fumbled in her purse. “A pity it vould
be to preak a pound—make it five sliillun.
To tell der truth, Anna, since ve had dat
lawsuit, tings don’t look too good.”
Anna stopped scribbling. “If that’s so,
Bena, don’t worry about giving anyt’ing—
I can cross it out. Not so many people will
notice it.”
“No, no, let it stand, it shall buy me a
good hour.”
“And Ikey a shirt,” said practical Anna.
Some months later Anna Abelson was
passing the store that Stepper had sold Mar-
covitz, when she saw Ikey coming out. He
was smoking a big cigar lie had just bought
from his good friend Joe Altona, and he
didn’t cough once. He had grown stout, his
suit was stretched tightly round him. Puff-
ing pride and smoke, he told Anna he would
be having a son before very long. If it
happened to be a daughter, he confided, “he
vould not trow it out der vinder.”
Anna thought it would be a nice surprise
for his parents and asked when they were
expected. “Dey are not expected. My vife
vouldn’t come at it at all. She says vot
mit der old people left over from her first
husband and her own, mine vould make it
too much of a crowd. Vy, it vould take all
our profits paying into der burial societies.
Und, after all,” he shrugged, “dey vouldn't
nefer understand der vays of us Auster-
alians.”

lie must then join the party of a qualified
surveyor and serve under Articles for a
period of four years, three of which should

tributors, Ltd., 343 Queen-street, Brisbane.
(1) Is a N.S.W. stock-inspector’s exami-
nation to be held in March, 1928? (2) Text-
books? (3) Principal regulations governing
examination? (4j Gan copy of last exami-
nation-paper be procured? (5) Gan a coach
be secured to give lessons by mail?— 2l6l.
(1) Yes. (2) “Veterinary Notes for Horse-
Owners,” by Hays; “Meat Inspection,” by
Woolley; “Diseases of Cattle” and “Diseases
of Horses” (issued by U.S.A. Dept, of Agri-
culture) ; pamphlets issued by the stock
branch of the N.S.W. Dept, of Agriculture.
(3) Candidates must be over 21 and under 50
and produce testimonials as to character. Can-
didates must satisfy board of examiners by
written and oral examination that they have
(a) knowledge of the care and management
of livestock, (b) knowledge of Stock Act,
Pastures Protection Act, Stock Diseases Act,
Commons Regulation Act, Registration of
Stock Brands Act and all their related amend-
ing Acts, (c) general knowledge of common
diseases in stock, particularly diseases men-
tioned in or proclaimed under the foregoing
Acts. Those studying veterinary science at or
holding a Veterinary Science degree from an
Australian university or recognised body are
exempted from sitting for (a) and (c). (4)
No; these are never made available. (5)
J. F. McEachran, M.R.C.V.S., 37 Market-
street, Randwick, Sydney, will advise you as
to veterinary side of examination.
Is State or Federal income-tax payable on
Tattersall’s Sweep and Golden Gasket prizes
won by N.S.W. residents? —2198.
Neither.
(1) Is it permissible to fish with net or
fixed lines on the Upper Brisbane River
( Q.)? (2) Gan a man row up and down
the river through my property fishing? —
1732.
(1) The Queensland Fish and Oyster Act
of 1914 provides that it is unlawful (a)
to have in possession, or construct, keep or
use in any river, stream, watercourse or
other water any fixed apparatus for the
taking of freshwater fish; (b) to take fresh-
water fish in- any river, stream, watercourse
or other water by any means other than
by a hand-line wfitli not more than two
hooks attached. (2) Without definite infor-
mation as to the location of the property
and a description of its boundaries in rela-
tion to the Upper Brisbane River, it would
be impossible to answer this question. Gen-
erally by the Water Act of 1926 the right
to the control of the water in a water-
course at every place where such water-
course is not subject to tidal influence is
vested in the Crown, but the owner or occu-
pier of any land adjacent to such water-
course has, under certain conditions, the
right to protect himself against trespass.
Are mule ducks better for breeding than
pure strains? Which are the best crosses?
—2364.
Mules are better for table purposes, but
only a small percentage of matings are
successful. Muscovy drakes with Pekin or
Aylesbury ducks.
Cause of enlargement of abdomen and sub-
sequent death of young chickens?— 2336.
Probably wrong feeding. Give a little
Epsom salts in the drinking-water and don’t
give binding food. Are they eating too much
charcoal?
Gould you tell me how to erect a dwelling
of pise? —22s2.
A composition of one part clay, one part
small sand gravel and two parts loam
thoroughly well mixed, free from all foreign
matter and with water added to the extent of
seven to fourteen per cent, of the dried earth
in weight, make a good pise. Tests for shrink-
age, etc., should be made and shrinkage
should not exceed two and a half per cent.
Shuttering must be rigid and the earth mix-
ture deposited in layers of four to five inches
and well but irregularly rammed. Trenches
for footings should be well damped before
depositing. Where heavy rain occurs a con-
crete footing is advisable. Ant stops must
be used. Eaves snould have a good overhang.
Outside walls should be well sprayed with
hot tar and color washed on top of tar.
Work should be done in warm, dry weather
and must be protected from wet. The Build-
ing Research Board’s special report No. 5 in
“Building in Cob and Pise-de-terre,” pub-
lished by lI.M. Stationary Office, London,
25., deals with the matter.
Cost per mile of construction of railway
in N'.S.W. Mack-soil plains, assuming no
engineering difficulties and an unballasted
line to carry traffic up to, say, 25 miles per
hour?— 2lo7.
With 601 b. rails, Bft. x 9in. x 44in. half-
round sleepers, and earth ballasted, £5OOO
per mile.
With A.C. supply does an electricity meter
register less with a drop in voltage? —l742.
An A.C. meter measures the amount of
watts consumed, and as watts are the pro-
ducts of volts and amperes a drop in voltage
will mean that the meter will register less.
My launch is 35 ft. long, lift, beam, 3 ft.
draught, medium-shaped bow, with 15-h.p.
engine doing 850 r.p.m. driving three-bladed
propeller 20 in. diameter tvith 15in. pitch.
She does eight miles per hour. Is it possible
to increase speed without increasing fuel
consumption (one gall, kerosene per hour)
by fitting another propdller? —2osB.
, For the size and type of vessel your speed
and consumption is satisfactory. A larger
propeller will reduce your engine speed and
the speed of the boat. You might make the
following experiments: As the draught is
rather shallow for a 20in. propeller, try
trimming the vessel by the stern a little.
Also try closing throttle a little. You might
lose only a half-minute per mile, but con-
sumption, which varies as the cube of the
speed, should be much less. Any increase in
speed over eight miles per hour for launch
work is obtained only with a great increase
in power and fuel consumption.
Can you tell me how to tan snake- and
kangaroo-skins so as to make the leather
white ? —-2201 and 2433.
Snake- and kangaroo-skins can be cured
with powdered alum, which bleaches the skin
almost snow-white. Soak the skins for a
few hours in cold water until quite soft, then
scrape the back to remove any flesh or fat.
For snake-skins, rub alum into the skin and
soak for eight hours in a liquor composed of
2oz. powdered alum, loz. common salt, 1
gallon of water. Afterwards wash thoroughly,
mix fresh liquor and soak for another eight
hours. It will be necessary to press the
scales down; a household wringer or, mangle
will do. Roll from the base of the scales to
the tips. Stretch out to dry in a cool place,
using a tack every three inches on each side.
Kangaroo-skins require double the strength
of liquor and twice the time. Also the skins
need to be stretched very carefully back to
their shape.
Names and addresses of firms which sup-
ply seeds of Australian native plants in
1 Vestralia and IS. Aus.— 22o9.
E. Symonds, 200 William-street, Perth ; R.
Sewell, Beehive Buildings, liundle-street,
Adelaide. If neither has what you seek
write D. Feakes, Director, Botanical Gar-
dens, Perth; and J. F. Bailey, Director,
Botanic Gardens, Adelaide.
Where can I obtain the seeds of D’Alberti
Papuan creeper, mentioned by “Bihai” ( B,
13/10/’27)'?—2200.
Write to the Resident Magistrate, Delta
Division, Kikori, Papua. Enclose postal-
note for 2s. 6d. to cover return postage and
to pay for tobacco for the native searchers.
The seeds are difficult to obtain, but you
may get a few.
Where can I obtain authentic information
about my grandfather, Joshua Thorp, at one
time Assistant Engineer to the N.B.W. Govt,
and Superintendent of Works. Did he lose
his position because he was an emancipa-
tionist? Was he a convict and was his wife
a convict or the daughter of a convict? —2o7l.
Joshua Thorp was not a convict. He
arrived as a passenger from England by the
ship Aguilar in February, 1824. He was
appointed assistant in the Engineer’s
Department, January 20, 1825. From 1828-
32 he was Superintendent of Public Works.
In 1832 there was a re-arrangement of
public offices, the Public Works Depart-
ment was abolished, the staff reduced and
most of the work transferred to the Sur-
veyor-General’s Department. Thorp com-
menced practice as an architect and sur-
veyor in April, 1832. Cannot find any
information about his wife.
Can a High School girl who has taken a
course in commercial art complete her
studies as an apprentice? —24B6.
Apprentices are taken by some studios, but
it is better to obtain a position and study in
spare time.
How to make cream cheese? —2480.
Set a pan of thick, sour milk in hot
water, or in a warm oven, to heat slowly;
scald until whey separates from curds, but
do not allow to boil. Line colander with
coarse cloth, dip the scalded curd into it;
then tie corners of cloth together and drain.
When quite dry, turn into a dish, rub fine
with spoon, add a little salt, a few spoonfuls
of cream or rich milk, and beat together till
light and smooth. It may be formed into
balls with the hands. Keep in a cool place.
Best when freshly made.
Is cheese as sustaining as meat? Does it
digest as quickly as pork? —24B4.
has twice the muscle-making value
of meat. An ounce of cheese is equivalent
to one egg, a glass of milk or 2oz. meat.
Cheese digests in 34 hours; roast pork 5i
hours.
Is there a special name for the female
swan ? —2482.
No.
Is it necessary to place a 2d. duty-stamp
on duplicate receipts given in N.S.W. for
amounts of £2 or over? —2392.
Yes.
Can yon tell me how to prevent rain
coming through a flat cement tarred roof
which has cracked? —2181.
Remove all tar from the roof and cracks.
For every five gallons of water add one
gallon of Elaterite cement waterproofing pre-
paration. Fill up the joints with cement
mixture and, when set hard, give one or
two coats of Elaterite. Preparation costs
17s. 6d. per gallon and can be got■ lro m

ground. Hang the meat in the top of the
gable and light a slow fire beneath it. Be
careful not to use fuel that will cause an
odorous smoke. Well-smoked meat will keep
indefinitely.—“Yufu.”
2090. —To cure meat, dissolve 41b. salt, 21b.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
There was more quality in evidence at
Sandown Park (Vic.) on Saturday, and
three races were captured by horses sport-
ing No. 1 on the saddle-cloth. But punters
in general had an unsatisfactory day. Hun-
dreds of them followed Wren’s lead in back-
ing his Burrabadeen mare Bounteous for
a division of the Trial Welter, only to see
her get the worst of a very bad start. \\ ten
has been unlucky w T ith Burrabadeen mares.
Versatile (6 to 1), a daughter of Pistol--
Longchamps, had a very easy Win. She
was fourth in the Oaks.
Waranton had shown a glimpse of liis
old form in running second to Highland at
Epsom, so he was sure of support even if
Jones had not been engaged. The old fel-
low went out at 9 to 2, Quirk and Coogee
Bay sharing favoritism at 7 to 2, The long
run home suited Waranton, and he cut
down Googee Bay and scored comfortably,
Lady Yarborough being third. St. Anton’s
best offspring now belongs to Affirm’s owner,
“Goodie” Harris; he carried 9st. 131b. and
ran the six furlongs in lmin.^Hsec.
Betting on the Sandown Park Handicap
took a wide range, and practically every one
of the 11 starters had friends. Elarby, a
Spearhead gelding, finished up first choice
at 4 to 1; Reputed King and Spearset were
at 9 to 2, Tea Bell at 6 to 1, Horoscope at
sevens and Snomi at eights. Tordilla, a
Lanius filly, led to near the home turn,
where The Lance (10 to 1) shot to the
front. A little further on Horoscope took
charge, only to be challenged by Chickling
110 to 1). In a desperate finish Harry
Masterton’s gelding prevailed by a head,
Chickling beating The Lance by a length or
so; the 10 furlongs were clocked at 2min.
8sec. Horoscope is the Absurd —Lady Ball
chestnut who ran so meritorious a second
to Don Moon in the A.J.C. Doncaster on
that wet Easter Saturday. He is trained
by Elwood Fisher and gave Harold Jones
his second successive victory. The stable
was lucky to get 7 to 1 (and better) about
him in such a field.
In the Purse a 20-to-l chance, Sea Pilot
(Sea Prince —Monodia), scored by half a
head from another outsider in Curlip (25 to
1) ; the favorite, Military Lady (9 to 4),
was third. The winner, who is owned and
trained by Walter Hickenbotham, jun., is
not much good, but old racegoers were
pleased to see the yellow jacket and black
cap in the money once more.

The A.J.C. has had improvements made to
its pretty Warwick Farm course, and in
ordinary circumstances there would have
been an exceptionally large crowd at the
meeting arranged for Saturday, but the
weather —very hard on the premier N.S.W.
club this year—decided otherwise. It rained
steadily for three days, and there had to be
a postponement till Tuesday, with a pony
meeting preceding and following. Naturally
the attendance suffered. The Greenstead
mare Greenie made a good effort to win
the Yarraville Handicap, six furlongs, but
jiust failed to concede 101 b. to Cadenza, who
went out at 9to 2; Social Success. was third.
Cadenza is one of the Valais tribe, and a
bit in-and-out, but she is speedy wh-en she
takes it into her head to gallop. Honan,
the popular choice for the Homeb'ush Handi-
cap, the principal race of the day, was
beaten by The Bulletin’s selection, Blair-
court, who was quoted at tens.
There will be another meeting at the Farm
on Saturday, and it is to be hoped that the

For the Great Northern Cup, to be run
at Newcastle on Saturday, Spaghetti (7st.
121 b.) looks a fair bet. Ivantile (Bst. 41b.)
would doubtless win were he back to his
Queensland Cup form, but it may be too
early to punt on him with confidence. He
is engaged in the Christmas Cups.
* * * *
“Minto”: It was not uncommon in the
’nineties to run a horse in two weight-for-
age races on one day. At the Sydney Cup
meeting in 1890 Carbine won the All-Aged
Stakes and the Cumberland Stakes, scoring
easily on both occasions. At that meeting
he won five races, beating such fliers as
Melos, Dreadnought. Sir William, Prelude
and Correze. The following season Carbine
essayed to win the same double again, but
had to lower his colors to Marvel, who
defeated him in the All-Aged Stakes. So
disgusted was Carbine that when the clerk
of the course rode up to conduct Marvel to
the enclosure “Old'Jack” went for him open-
mouthed.
* * * *
“Thormanby” : The English flatracing sea-
son closed with Lord Derby at the head of
the owners’ list. Eighteen horses sporting
Derby colors won 37 races, returning a total
value of £47,000. Next came Lord Astor,
with five winners, 10 races and £29,975.
The Aga Khan had a pretty fair year, too;
10 prads (17 firsts) put £20,070, or its
Moslem equivalent, in the plate. Gordon
Richards was out on his own as a rider;
he earned a winning fee on 164 occasions.
C. Elliott, with 77 successes, was second.
Of the nags themselves, Book Law, winner cf
the Leger, Oaks and four other races, was
at the top of the oat-earning table, turn-
ing in £27,745 —something of a record for a
filly, even in these days of greatly increased
prize-money.
* * * *
“Ike Mcßagg”: Some people are always
ready to encroach on the activities of others.
One of these, Riordan, of Burke, complained
in the Queensland Parliament the other day
that to his knowledge, 20 or 30 civil servants
were employed as clerks by bookmakers on
the Brisbane racecourses every Saturday.
But for the civil servant, he explained, the
Tommy would have to pay a man a weekly
wage if lie wanted to be sure of a clerk
for race days. We have already seen that
the struggling fraternity has been reduced,
in some instances, to using the same betting
tickets twice over (B. 24/11/’27), with
results unfortunate to themselves. Now
there is another intrusion on their praise-
worthy efforts in the direction of thrift. It
is all very well for M’s.L.A. to condemn the
bookmaker. They give someone else’s money
away whenever they vote on a bill involving
expenditure. The Tommy is distributing his
own hard-earned funds in largesse to the
punters. Read any of the racing writers in
the daily papers after a big meeting, if you
don’t believe me. The Brisbane system has
its advantages for the civil servant, as well:
it keeps him awake one afternoon in the
week, at least. As for the bookmaking
industry, its condition is growing desperate.
The boys are seriously considering the lues-
tion of approaching the Minister for
Customs to see if the tariff or something
can’t afford them relief.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Phil Krug, the U.S. middleweight, now in
Sydney, exhibits all the stock-in-trade of a
notable performer; but it is shop-worn anil
window-stained. This was clearly shown at
the Stadium when he boxed Scotsman Mc-
Innes, who, coming in at list. 3f)lb., was
the lighter pug. by 2flb. Mclnnes attacked
fiercely all the time; Krug clinched and
claimed until the small crowd got very weary
and repeatedly urged the Yank, without
success, to “Come out of it and fight a
round.” As the contest proceeded Krug’s
punches were few and far between, and
Mclnnes merely grinned when they landed ;
for his own part, he waxed more and more
energetic. It looked odds on Scotty scoring
a comfortable victory, both on points and
aggressiveness; but the referee’s hand fell
on Krug’s head at the conclusion of the
fifteenth round. If smothering and holding
score more than forcing and successful hit-
ting, the award was correct.
* * •■!: *
Fred Brock has all the fine points and
knows more about their application than
any other Australian in the game. But as a
fighter Fred belongs to the pre-war division,
and Gordon Iviely proved too young and fiery
for him in their controversy at Leichhardt
on Friday night. Brock’s skill had the
Victorian guessing on frequent occasions,
but Kiely’s smart stand-off hitting and
sustained attack placed him so obviously
in the lead that the verdict which went his
way at the end of the fifteenth round was
undisputed. The Wonthaggi lad is improv-
ing with experience, and is likely to go &
long way. His next contest will probably
be against Merv Williams for the middle-
weight championship.
* fls * *
“Strangler”: The sun went down, as it
were, on the mostly-simulated wrath of the
wrestling fraternity at Sydney Stadium on
Monday, when Karasick and Pergantes
were seen in an eight-rounder which ended
in a draw. In view, perhaps, of Ministerial
inquiries as to the “humanity” of the game,
there was a strong contingent of police
present, but that did not prevent the con-
testants from indulging in the usual ameni-
ties. Each periodically threw the other out
of the ring, and Karasick used language that
even a Surry Hills lady would not permit
from her own husband. Apart from all that,
it was, as the broadcasting expert announ-
ced, “a prutty qui-et aff-air.”
Racquet and Bawl
Contrary to the expectations of the tips-
ters, N.S.W. defeated Victoria in Melbourne
by 13 rubbers, 29 sets, 267 games, to 7 rub-
bers, 23 sets, 252 games; it accordingly
regained the Mars Buckley Cup. Inciden-
tally, the youngest members of the N.S.W.
team increased their prospects for Davis
Cup selection; Crawford beat Hawkes and
Patterson in the singles, and Hopman
downed Wertheim and Clemenger. An even
bigger surprise was Kalms’s defeat of Patter-
son; the country player proved it was no
fluke by accounting for Hawkes on the second
day. In the doubles, which Victoria was
expected to wun easily, the Welshmen won
four of the eight matches.
In the Crawford-Patterson affair, save
for the opening exchanges, the young N. S.
Welshman was master throughout. He re-
peatedly broke through Patterson’s service,
and won with his own ; indeed, his confident
treatment of the champion’s service, which
he rarely failed to return on back or fore-
hand, was the feature of his game. The
lad won by 9-7, 2-6, 6-2; against Hawkes
his scores were 11-9, 4-6, 6-1. Kalms beat
Patterson after losing the first set. The
second ran to 22 games, and the effort fagged
the big fellow, who faded out in the deciding
set; scores, 2-6, 12-10, 6-1. In the match
with Hawkes (it was 6-4, 3-6, 6-4) Kalms’s
service was the outstanding feature. In
the doubles, Kalms and Schlesinger had a
meritorious win over Patterson and Hawkes,
scoring 10-8, 6-1, but went down to Fitchott
and Clemenger. These young men were
beaten by Crawford and Hopman, who also
overcame O’Hara Wood and Wertheim, but
were not quite good enough for Patterson
and Hawkes. The Victorians won the
women’s matches by 6 rubbers to 4, Daphne
Akhurst being beaten by Esna Boyd after
a most exciting tussle, the scores being 7-o,
9-7.
Victoria’s second string beat South
Australia by 11 rubbers to 10. In the
singles on the first day, Rowe, G. M. Hone
and Turnbull were all successful for the
visitors, while Rowe and G. M. Hone won
two of the doubles games. D. Turnbull and
Shepherd also collecting their match. On
Saturday, R. B. Hone went down to G.
Stuart, 'while Mclnnes beat G. M. Hone.
Stuart’s fine play was the deciding factor:
with MacGillicuddy he defeated R. B.
Hone and James in the doubles by 2 sets
to 1. But the South Aus. women vanquished
the Vies, by 9 rubbers to 3. Miss Le Mesu-
rier doing well in both single and double
events. The Vic. thirds disposed of the Tas-
manians, both flannel-trousers and skirts.

THE PUNTER WHO SWITCHED.
[For The Bulletin.]
When the weary day is over and the last,
swift race is run,
And the crowded train turns homeward
with its load of hopes undone,
And your thoughts are mainly grey ones, as
a mem’ry on you steals
Of the horse that won the Welter, tis no
joy to hear the wheels;
“Should have backed it! Should have backed
It!” growl the mumbling, grumbling
wheels.
You recall the morning ardor of your brisk,
unclouded brain,
And your reasoning dispassionate occurs to
you again ; ,
“Thus and so,” you said, “it galloped. Thus
and so, then, it appeals,”
And you see your thoughts as flawless as the
rhythm of the wheels; _
“And you picked it! And you picked it.
sing the busy purring wheels.
Then once more you hear the clamor of the
eager, betting throng . ,
In the rolling, muffled thunder of the tram s
ascending song,
Till once more you feel the doubting, that
a knowing whisper deals
To the certainty you cherished, with a halt-
ing of the wheels;
“Is it so good? Is it so good?” ask the
slurring, slowing wheels.
In the failing and the faulting that a tardy
signal gives
All your dreadful hesitation once again
acutely lives;
But the right-of-way is given (he must surely
know, one feels,
And one’s fancy is discarded) to the rasping
of the wheels ; .
“Now’ you've done it! Now you’ve done it.
cry the carping, quick’ning wffleeis.
But the race is run and over, and excite-
ment’s at an end;
And one’s picking, it was clever, but—-one
listened to a friend ;
And if life is dust and ashes, still a sports-
man never squeals,
Though he grow a little weary of reiterating
wheels'; .
“But you picked it! But you picked it.
roar those dashed insistent wheels;
“Should have backed it! Should have backed
it!” shout those. . . .well, those.. . .oh,
those wheels!
VICTORIA.

“Timson”: Jack Crawford’s tennis ability
is inherited. His father and mother were
excellent players, and Jack was ball-boy
for the rest of the family until he had
readied 10; he was then allowed to start
his own career on the hard courts of Albury
and adjacent places. Two sisters and a
brother, the latter an A-grade pennant cap-
tain, are also active on the white oblong.
Jack is no mean hand at snooker, which he
pursues with some relish, and wields a handy
stick at golf.
* * * *
“Skyrider”: This summer should see a
revival in N. S. Wales of the proposal to
hold a “country week,” in the country
instead of at Busheutter Bay. Country
players and club secretaries complain that
the N.S.W.L.T.A. asks for too much money
from country clubs and gives too little in
return. The establishment in Goulburn of
excellent association courts has given the
game a tremendous uplift in that centre,
while at Crookwell, 30 miles away, the
annual tourneys attract crowds of spectators.
A Southern Districts Association is mooted,
with headquarters at Goulburn, and with
the right men in charge it should become a
powerful body. Mrs. Martin, the Sielers and
other strong players reside in the district,
and there is some fine young material to
work on.
* * * *
“Bisque”: The first Davis Cup trials will
be played at the Busheutter Bay courts,
Sydney, on December 9 and 10. Victoria
will send Patterson, ITawkss and Sclilesin-
ger; Gar Hone and Rowe will form the
Adelaide contingent, and Moon will be the
Queensland rep. N.S.W. players will include
Crawford, Hopman, Kalms, Jim Willard and
Cummings. A curious feature of the list is
that Schlesingcr appears as a Victorian can-
didate, while he represented N.S.W. against
Victoria in the inter-State match in Mel-
bourne.
* * * *
“Sturt” : Adelaide tennis people feel, reason-
ably enough, that they are entitled to see a
Davis Cup trial, and have asked the Austra-
lian L.T.A. to let them have one. The reply
was that it couldn’t be managed, as it had
been arranged for the selectors to pick the
team after the trial in Melbourne. The
South Australians were, however, granted
permission to play their own championships
and the inter-State matches on Feb. 17 and
25. If they aren’t grateful for that, nothing
will satisfy them.
* * * *
“Lob”: Arrangements for the overseas
tour of an Australian women’s tennis team
have now been completed. Four players will
compose the side, and Harley Malcolm,
secretary of the Australian L.T.A., will be
manager. The party will get off at South
Africa on its way to Europe, and play a
series of matches there —it will be the first
invasion of South Africa by an Australian
team. The players have yet to be chosen,
but Daphne Akhurst and Esna Boyd may
be counted certainties.
❖ $
“Top Spin”: The Westralian tennis autho-
rities recently put in am urgent request to
the Australian Association for the appear-
ance of the French players at Perth, on
their way back to Europe. The L.T.A. has
approved, and the Westerners will see the
visitors for two days at least. If the
Adelaide programme can be finished in time,
it may .be possible to add another day to
the Perth programme. As the Gropers esti-
mate they wall get a gate of £l4OO for each
day of the Frenchmen’s exhibition, they are
fervently praying for a quick and happy dis-
patch of the South Aus. tourney.
The Ins and Outs
Though the Brisbane wicket was inclined
to play tricks at one end, Queensland opened
the Sheffield Shield season in good style on
Saturday, making 354 for eight wickets
against N.S.W. The opening batsmen, O’Con-
nor and Ron. Oxenham, put on 48 before the
captain tipped one from Jordan to Morgan at
slip, and went for 21. Oxenham plodded
on, with the free-hitting Gough to help him;
the young fellow left when he had made 38,
and Oxenham was caught by Mailey off a
kicking ball from Everett for a well-made
63. Thompson went cheaply, and four were
down for 146. Then Rowe, playing his 33rd
match for Queensland, became associated
with Nothling in a fine stand. The Sydney
University man contributed a most useful 46;
and Benstead (44) carried on the good work,
leaving Rowe (96) and Hornibrook (6)
to continue the innings on the second
day. As it happened there was no
play on Monday owing to rain. Apart
from Jordan and Phillips, the N.S.W.
attack was not impressive. The Glebe colt
took 2 for 52, but bowled much better than
the figures indicate. Everett (2 for 51) was
not convincing, and Mailey had 120 runs
knocked oft' him for one wicket. Phillips got
two tail-end wickets for 11 runs. Sundries
ran to 29, an unusual total with Oldfield
’keeping, but there were several no-balls, and
some of Everett’s deliveries went over the
stumper’s head, right out of reach.

“Canny Lad”: The wealthy N.S.YV.
Cricket Association, after much searching of
heart and the petty cashbox, has consented
to allow the N.S.W. team which is to visit
Adelaide to go there via Broken Hill, pro-"
vided the Barrier authorities pay the cost
of the deviation. It is a queer way of
fostering country cricket, a point on which
the association is fond of chucking a chest.

“St. Toorak”: A glance over the names
of the Victorian team which is to do battle
against South Aus. at Adelaide indicates
that the Vic. selectors retain their awed
respect for old age. With plenty of young
bowlers to choose from, and a strong batting
side which has practically picked itself, the
only new man is Scaife, another batsman.
Certainly South Aus.’s two newcomers,
Johnston and Whitfield, are both batsmen,
but the Wheat State has such promising
young bowlers as Lee, who took 5 wickets
for 36 against N.S.W. in Sydney last year,
and Halcombe, who has replaced Scott as
the express. With ordinary luck, S. Aus.
should start the season with a win.

“Hotliam” : The most recent (and not the
least asinine) demonstration of regard for
the amateur status has been staged by the
Vic. Cricket Association. This body has a
rule stating that any player who receives
money for coaching or playing cricket, out-
of-pocket expenses excepted, shall be deemed
a professional. Subsequent to W. M. Wood-
full receiving permission from the State Gov-
ernment —he is a teacher —to conduct a

coaching class for foes the Y.C.A. called on
him to show’ cause why he should not be
declared a pro. After considering the matter
from various angles, it dodged the issue by
deciding to wait till some other club entered
a protest against Carlton, of which Woodfull
is captain, for fielding a professional with-
out permission. The whole business is hypo-
crisy personified. Woodfull, like every other
member of the Australian eleven, is already
a pro. in all hut name. He has taken
money from the Board of Control for playing
cricket in England. Why, then, make such
a mountain out of his acceptance of fees for
teaching?

“Oval”: South Australia’s bowling com-
petition for aspiring colts (B. 10/11/ 27)
unearthed some likely youngsters. The
winner was J. It. Marshall, a Prince Alfred
College boy; he bowls right medium, and
shows excellent judgment in variation of
pace. B. J. Tobin, who was placed
second, is a tall youth from Christian
Brothers' College; a fast-medium right-
hander, he has a very high and easy action.
M. Waite, who was third, has played three
matches w'ith West Torrens. He is a slow
leg-bowler, with a good length.
*** * <
“E.S.”: In an inter-town match the other
day a Clarence River (N.S.W.) batsman
scored 376 runs in about hours. There
is plenty of good material about “the
rivers.” I remember when teams used to
assemble about 10 a.m. They took coats,
vests and boots off (some their outside
shirts as well), tucked their trousers up to
the knees, and went at it for the rest of
the day. A player who didn’t remove his
boots was reckoned degenerate. On one occa-
sion when a team was being picked there
was argument over the merits of a fairly
good performer, till one of the selectors
clinched matters with the remark: “Leave
him out; he never takes his boots off.”
* * * *
“Aunt Sally”: Herbert Strudwiek, of
Surrey, who succeeded A. A. Li 1 ley as Eng-
land’s first ’keeper, has had to hang up his
gloves at last. “Struddy” came to Australia
with P. F. Warner in 1904-05 and 1911-12,
with Douglas in 1920-21, and with Gilligan
in 1924-25, and he visited South Africa twice.
Ilis last game for England was the lifth
Test in 1925. In his first-class career he
caught 1235 and stumped 258 batsmen.
Henceforth he will be a scorer.
* * * *
‘H.K.”: Cricketer Arthur Coningham (B.
24/11/'27) holds a queer Brisbane club re-
cord; he scored all the runs (26) made by
Stanley against Albert in 1891. His 151,
compiled for Queensland in 1895, long stood
as the Northern State’s individual highest
score against Ma State bowling.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: As the youngster
with the bat much too big for him and the
single batting pad that nearly hid his face
went to the kerosene-tin wicket, someone
said “Last man in!” The excitement
amongst the “gang” under the tree grew
intense. Chiller —the youngster disguised
in the legging was Chiller, obviously—was
urged to “ ’lt /im fer four.” The first Dali
he received sped behind the wicket, but
Chiller didn’t run —a small youth volunteered
the information; that they were not running
for anything behind the wicket. A dull
bang on the kerosene tin announced that
Chiller had failed to survive the next ball.
The boy with the penny notebook closed it
with a snap as someone asked him the
score. “On’y seven !” he said. “But we’d’ve
bin a ’urnlred if we’d taken all the byes.”
The Nineteenth Hole
“Colonel Damurize”: An English golf
journal has been advocating a “one day, one
club” system of practice. You reserve Mon-
day for the driver, Tuesday for the mashie,
Wednesday for the mid-iron, and so on. Noth-
ing is said of the arrangement for Sunday,
but on that day, one presumes, the lessons
learned (if any) during the week are to be
applied to actual play, or, as seems more
fitting, to solitary and prayerful reflection
on one’s golfing sins of omission and com-
mission. The programme does not leav-s
much time for actual golf, but that is the
last thing up-to-date golfers, with their
brooding obsessions as to stance and style,
seem to worry about. I know a lot of people
who would sooner acquire Abe Mitchell’s
lateral swing or Bobby Jones's knack of
keeping his head down than Avin the open
championship of Australia. To them the
hitting of a good ball is as Dead Sea fruit
if it is not done in exactly one of tin;
seventeen differing styles laid down by as
many alleged masters of the game.

“Claypan” : Queensland golfers are a hardy
race. It is taken as a matter of course in
the back-country that members should turn
to and do a bit of voluntary toil in keeping
their links in order or extending and
improving them. Even in Brisbane they have
been sallying forth with pick and shovel to
get the Sandgate course in a “playable con-
dition,” while at Indooroopilly working-bees
of volunteers have been hand-planting the
greens. One doesn’t hear much of that kind
of thing at Sandringham or Rose Bay.
:i: * * *
“Divot Digger” : In his recent book Bobby
Jones goes into the old question of why
people who rarely lose their tempers in ordi-
nary circumstances find them going absent
without leave the minute they begin to play
golf. Like everyone else who has tackled
the question, Jones fails to find a satis-
factory reason. Even billiards, notoriously
a game with an evil effect on the temper,
rarely rouses the furious brainstorms that
overwhelm the golfer. Possibly the explana-
tion lies in the fact that no game equals
golf in its ruthless exposure of the vanity of
human aspirations. It is a dreadful thing
for man. proud man, to find that in the pre-
sence of his midiron and his putter he is
but as a crushed worm. With all his faith
in himself shattered, and the world he has
dominated crumbling about him, he tastes for
the first time in his life, perhaps, the bitter-
ness of defeat, and seeks consolation in that
last refuge of prince and pauper-—fervent
blasphemy.
$ * *
“Stickler”: Speaking at a Brisbane golf
dinner, a leading light animadverted on the
disregard of the etiquette of the game which
is all too common among modern players.
The same complaint has been voiced in
Sydney, and one might go further. Just
as a young man entering on his career must
learn that a well-tied necktie is the first
step in social life, so must the young golfer
learn when, as well as how, to use the
proper implements of the craft. There
are many who carelessly resort to a
mid-iron when etiquette demands a mashie,
and think no shame of it. These might
take example from the verdict of a jury in
a murder case reported from America.
Accused was charged with destroying his
wife with a golf club. After retiring, the
jury returned into court and asked the
accused what club he had used. “The
niblick,” said the unhappy man. “Quite
right!” said the foreman. “Your Honor,
we return a verdict of not guilty.”

“Skyrider” : If Drake played bowls while
awaiting tidings of the Armada, I am con-
vinced Noah indulged in golf while waiting
for the ark to move out of dry dock. One
of the ancient navigator’s descendants, on
the wettest Saturday morning of November,
set out from his Sydney home with his bag
of sticks and spent a puddlesome day in
following a ball from Figtree to Fairyland.
Did I say a ball? He lost four in the
reeking bush, two dropped into Lane Cove
river, and one lodged in the mangroves on
a mudbank. But the enthusiast arrived home
safe, though wet to the skin, and he there
and then announced his intention of floating
a company to lay out links along the course
he had followed. “Finest hazards in the
world,” he confided to me. As long as this
spirit survives I have no fears for the future
of the race.

The leading Independent firm of Scotch Whisky Distillers
“Whizz”: E. J. Buckley and L. L.
Bartlett have driven a standard 4730-c.c.
Hudson chassis from Melbourne to Sydney,
570 miles, in 11 hours 54 minutes 30 seconds,
reducing the late A. V. Turner’s record by
39 minutes 30 seconds. Melbourne was left
at 4.5 a.m., and in spite of a wheel-replace-
ment job and traffic delays at the Sydney
end, the ear reached the Sydney G.P.O. just
before 4 p.m. The fastest spin was 234
miles in 235 minutes. A good performance,
but a dangerous one.
“Gabba” : Another good performance by a
small-power motor-cycle was recorded in
an acceleration test held last week by the
Brisbane Motor-Cycle Club. It was prac-
tically a speed test over quarter of a mile,
from a standing start, and a 2|-li.p.
Velocette, ridden by L. Crookall, finished
ahead of its more powerful competitors. Its
actual time was 18.8 seconds, and it had
a handicap of 4.3 seconds. Second place
was filled by E. Smyth's 31-h.p. Ariel, with
a handicap of 2.3 seconds and an adjusted
time of 15.4 seconds. A 7-li.p. James and
side-car, driven by G. W. Atkinson, was
third, with an adjusted time of 15.6. The
road surface was light and rubbly, and the
heavier cycles lost a considerable amount
fit’ time from wlieelspin while accelerating.

“Smash”: Good old Brisbane is keeping
up its reputation for providing entertaining
catastrophes at its motor-cycle meetings,
and in that respect has the wrestling at
Sydney Stadium looking like a draughts
tourney at the Y.M.C.A. Consider the saga
of one Spink and his machine, with which
he parted company. The motor-bike
"jumped on its wheels” and made for the
safety fence. “At the point of impact there
were three rows of densely packed specta-
tors, who were terror-stricken. As the
machine rose and cleared the fence it struck
the top of the picket fence which stands a
few feet behind the safety fence and knocked
off severaL palings.” After some wild sur-
mise the local war correspondent turns to
the casualties. There were seven of these,
including two women and a small boy. With
the boy is introduced the true Hollywood
touch: “He was-badly shaken and dazed,
but his first inquiry oil gaining consciousness
was, ‘ls Spinksey hurt?’ He made a
pathetic figure as he moaned this generous
question, utterly forgetful of self in his con-
cern for the welfare of his idol.” But you
never know. Possibly he wanted to sue
"Spinksey” for damages if “Spinksey” was
still alive.

“G.C.”: Canada was the scene of the
latest motor-cycle non-stop test. The bike
was a 2f-h.p. Harley-Davidson, standard
solo ; running for 12 days, it did 7344 miles
at 102 miles to the gallon of petrol. Some
figure fiend triumphantly reports that the
engine revolutions worked out at 46,678,544.

“C.Q.”: Hubert Opperman, winner of the
Dunlop Grand Prix (B. 24/11/’27), began
professional cycling as a telegraph-messenger
—he is 23 now. He was never harassed
throughout his long and hazardous tour of
some of Victoria’s roughest and stiffest roads ;
in fact, he felt so confident that at one stage
he handed a spare tube to a less fortunate
competitor whom he passed ruefully surveying
a puncture. Opperman proposes to go to
Europe next year, with the special inten-
tion of trying his luck in France.
Miscellaneous
The Waratahs won their second inter-
national and their 18th match of the tour
by decisively defeating Wales, at Cardiff, by
18 points to 8, thereby avenging the 9-6
defeat of the Wallabies 19 years ago on the
same ground. The 1927 tourists scored 4
tries, three converted, to 2 tries, one con-
verted. Their back division was rearranged ;
Bowers, whose handling has been bad lately,
was dropped, Wallace went to the wing, and
was replaced at centre by Sheehan, who
had King alongside him. Wallace scored the
first Waratah try from a cross-kick by Boss,
and Lawton converted. Lewis, the Welsh
five-eighth, then made an opening for Roberts
to cross, and scores were 5-3 at half-time.
Sheehan, who was at his top, set attack
after attack going in the second spell, and
went over himself, with a characteristic
swerving run, for Lawton to add another
goal. The next try came from a cross-kick
from Sheehan, E. Ford gathering and giving
King an in-pass to score; Lawton again
added the goal % Another cross-kick from
Sheehan gave Wallace a chance to pick up
and go over, Lawton’s kick hitting the cross-
bar. The Welshmen rallied desperately, but
though Lewis crossed, and Rees converted,
they failed to make any serious impression.
The Blue forwards again gave a great show-
ing, though the young Welsh vanguard stood
up to them manfully. Welsh football has
been off color during the past couple of sea-
sons, but on this occasion the greatest
trouble was taken to select a young and
clever team.
* $ * *
“Amateur Pro.”: Though N.S.W. has
long given up the pretence that the Rugby
League version of football is an amateur
sport, Queensland has persisted in the ami-
able fiction. But the Valley club, one of
the oldest and most successful of Queens-
land League bodies, burst the bubble the
other day by issuing a cash bonus to its
players. The Valley is the first Queensland
club to come out in the open in this regard,
and the practice will no doubt became gen-
eral. Why continue to deny the undeniable?
“Fitzcray” : Most politicians prefer getting
round a hurdle to going through or over it.
Not so Kent Hughes, one of the Victorian
M’s.L.A. A noted hurdler while at Mel-
bourne Grammar, and later an Oxford ath-
letic blue, the young man put off the spiked
shoe on his entry into politics. Now lie has
gone back to the cinders, and is turning out
with Kew harriers in the inter-club matches.
On his first appearance the other day he
won his heat in the 440 hurdles in 67sec.,
which, while not up to championship form,
is quite good moving over the sticks for a
man out of the game for some time.
“Avon” : Randolph Rose is the fastest run-
ner over one to three miles that Maoriland
has ever seen. He has been the big drawing-
card at every athletic meeting from the Bluff
to Hamilton for years past. But lie hasn’t
made any money out of it; as a matter of
fact, he has had to declare himself a bank-
rupt. The deficiency isn’t big;—£43o—and the
sports of Maoriland, who have been thrilled
by the unfortunate farmer’s great efforts on
the track, would not endanger their Dom-
inion’s reputation for thrift and sagacity if
they combined to give him a fresh start in
life.

“Don Crew”: "It happened like dis,” said
Isaacs when asked how he had become
affluent overnight. “I vas playin’ poker at a
cheutleman’s house. You never seen such a

shrugged his shoulders resignedly), after

“Chucker”: The old interest in water-polo
is reviving in N.S.W. In the days when poor
Barney Kieran was king in the realm of
swimming, the attractive and useful game was
RON. OXEN HAM, the Queensland all-
rounder, who has made a good start in
Sheffield Shield cricket this season.
highly popular. Queensland and Victoria
have always managed to keep it going, but
as an organised function N.S.W. has dropped
it for years. A challenge from Victoria to
resume the inter-State matches has been
accepted, though no date has been fixed;
there are to be competitions in three grades
beforehand. For the swimmer who is no
marvel over short or long distances, hut has
the capacity to feel thoroughly at home in
the water, water-polo—it would be better
styled “water-football” —is ideal.
“Slide": Everyone who follows rowing,
except a few of the last-ditcliers, will hear
with approval of the decision to hold the
inter-State eiglit-oar race on the Nepean River
at Penrith. There are many objections to the
Parramatta course— Bulletin contributors
have mentioned them all—but for such a
race the Nepean is ideal. The river, deep
down between high, sloping banks, is prac-
tically sheltered from wind; the current is
negligible; the course is straight for the
full throe miles, and training facilities are
of the best. Then the banks are natural
grandstands, with room for many thousands

of spectators and easily accessible from Syd-
ney by road and rail. It only remains for
the Great Public Schools to transfer their
annual regatta to the Nepean to make it the
accepted headquarters of the big rowing
events in N.S.W.
“Tin Eyre” : South Aus. has tackled the
tin-hare epidemic in a forthright fashion.
The new Coursing Restriction Bill is speci-
ally aimed at the gambling which is the
breath of the tin hare’s existence, and takes
no chances of evasion. Wsstralia also has
put a legal ban on tin-hare betting.
* * *
“Don Crew”: The shell-and-pea sharper
(B. 24/11/’27) has other illicit methods than
concealing the pea between his fingers. When
the mug displays a reluctance to bet, the
operator’s eyes will wander momentarily
from the game; then the buttoner lifts a
shell, exposes the pea, and replaces the shell
hastily. “It’s under that one,” he whispers
to the mug; “I’ll go a fiver with you.” The
mug generally stakes his money, and the
sharper places an impressive forefinger on the
shell —an action which causes the pea to
adhere to some cobbler’s wax inserted in the
upper arch. “Is this the one you mean?” he
queries. The mug says it is ; and the rest
is easy.
:5: # * *
“Tahune” : Homing-pigeon fanciers in the
Speck have many valuable birds taken by
hawks, despite systematic efforts to keep the
birds-of-prey down. A party from Hobart
lately raided an eyrie situated in a cave,
difficult of access, on a sheer cliffside. The
nest contained, besides three eggs and a
young bird, 45 pigeon rings. Pa and ma
were too wary to come within gunshot of
the home-breakers.
* * =i= *
“Colonel Damurize” : I have never made
any secret of my disapproval-of the intrusion
of women in manly sports, and an account
of some croquet matches played by members
of the visiting English team at Adelaide goes
to confirm me in this view. It states that
the play of Miss D. Steel was a feature of
the exhibition, the young woman beating
Colonel Dupre by 26 to 2. In many games,
nowadays, the same humiliating tendency is
to be observed. I have already commented
on its prevalence in golf, where the lack of
respect for one’s elders, conscious and uncon-
scious, is becoming a byword, and have re-
signed myself to the inevitable ; in short, I
have given up the game until some pioneer
forms a club for men only, preferably over
60. In the meantime, where is one to turn?
Croquet is closed to me for the same reason
as golf, and so are Badminton, tennis, lioup-la
and the chocolate-wheels. Punting at the tin
hares and the ponies is equally out of the
question. As an ex-member of the H.Q. Staff,
I haven’t got the brains alleged to be neces-
sary for chess, which seems to he the only
sport where women do not butt in and squeal.
I should be grateful for any suggestions from
you. Bowls is out of the question, too. The
quack has ordered me on to the water-
waggon.
Business, Robbery., etc.
“Haymarket” : Anthony Horderns made
Sydney open its eyes the other morning by
announcing that it was going to give
the lay-by system a spin; and, at any
rate, that is a thousand times better than
any of the credit-purchase schemes for
inducing the £5-a-week man to spend £5 10s.
The greatest defect of the lay-by system lias
been that after paying in two-thirds of the
value of the article “laid by” the purchaser
was liable to find that the trader had gone
bung. At least there won’t be any fears of
that sort to harass Anthony Horderns’
customers.
* * * *
“The Rumpus” : : Nowhere else in the Com-
monwealth is waste so pronounced as in
Westralian jar rah mills. The rough outside,
the white sap and often inches deep of the
red timber are looked upon as superfluous
material, and day after day the fire burns
its way through the heap. Some of the
ends and oddments are railed to the city for
firewood, but the amount which goes up in
smoke is appalling,
“S.M.”: The Australian Industries Pro-
tection League has discovered, and men-
tioned at length to the Prime Minister, some-
thing which The Bulletin explained a
long time ago. It is that Protection alone
can’t prevent local industry being swamped
by imports if wages rise while production
falls, and that some form of Prohibition is
necessary. Instead of making a list of dis-
pensable foreign goods and shutting them
out absolutely, the League proposes that
goods should be imported under license only,
and that when imports promise to exceed
the limit the issue of licenses should be
severely restricted till the position is righted.
It may not be the best way, but it is a way.
❖ * . :'fi
“Catalyst”: An aftermath of the South
Johnstone mill strike will be the burning and
dumping of 40,000 tons of cane that the mill
cannot crush this season. If allowed to
stand over till next year part of the stuff
would vanish down flooded creeks, and most
of it would be lying flat on the ground
entangled in grass and weeds and therefore
too expensive to recover. This lost cane
would have yielded 5330 tons of mill-white
sugar worth, say, £117,000. Another
triumph for “solidarity.”
“Beetart”: The complaint of “Harold
Hardupp” (B. 24/ll/’27)) that people who
want to buy and perform the works of Beet-
hoven, Mozart and other long-dead classical
composers have to purchase “adaptations”
or transcriptions • amazes me. As a matter
of fact, all the big music-sellers in Aus-
tralia stock practically all the dinkum clas-
sics that there are—certainly all the piano-
forte works of the first rank, including a lot
that are very seldom asked for. Possibly
the fact that their window displays are
usually made up of 000 copies of “Where Is
My Baby Parked To-night?” or “Susie Is the
Cat’s Pyjamas” has led to misunderstandings
regarding the stock behind the shop-front.
* $ ' *
“P.X.”: Beath Schiess prof, shares have
been as low as 4s., and to find the ordin-
aries you have to use a microscope. Now
and then a voice has been heard crying in
the wilderness that a concern with a good-
will like that must not be allowed to die:
but die it seems it will. The importer’s day
is done. True, he still has a large turnover,
but in the days of his abundance he got
into extravagant habits, and he finds it
terribly hard to cut out the swank and
economise now. And, of course, the man
with the little unpretentious factory at
Surry Hills or Carlton isn’t making things
any easier for him; he can turn over his
capital three or four times a year—five or
six times in some cases —while the importer
is very lucky if he turns his over twice.
A SPLENDID INVESTMENT.

SAND to Egypt Coals to Newcastle Whisky to Australia — the principle
I remains the same. Egypt’s sand is as good as any. Newcastle coal is second
to none. Australian whisky has no superior. And Australian whisky means
OLD COURT Whisky.
OLD COURT claims to be the world’s pureSt. It has earned the right to that
claim. In the paSt few months OLD COURT issued a £1000 challenge to any
who could prove it otherwise. The challenge has never been taken up.
The non acceptance of the challenge has reacted in favor of OLD COURT Whisky.
Sales have grown and grown. But many Australians have yet to learn that the
whisky distilled in Australia is as fine in quality as the best imported. They are
those who have never tried OLD COURT.
Despite Old Court’s increasing popularity, Australia lost £1,875,000 last year by
drinking imported whisky. Why let this waste continue? Why let prejudice
affect both national industry and individual pocket? Shipping sand to Egypt and

LETTER

The big flutter of a wet week-end was
David Jones’s moving. On Friday night,
behind closed doors at the old George-street
address, all hands and the cook got busy, and
by Sunday night the biggest move that Syd-
ney has known was an accomplished fact.
The new premises, built on the site bf the old
Girls’ High School, with frontages to Mar-
ket, Elizabeth and Castlereagh streets, seem
overawing to those accustomed to the
friendly intimacy of the firm’s old home
opposite the Post Office. There one would
never have been surprised to find a lady in
a crinoline tying on a Paisley shawl, or a
flapper in the bangs and tight waist and
bustle of Phil May’s short hour passing
down the stairs on the way to the family
Victoria that waited without. But, of
course, we shall get used to the change.
Into the vast tiled fioorage of the new
store, Underground and trams and taxis
vomited their thousands on Monday—among
them grandchildren and great-grandchildren
of those original customers of David Jones
from Carmarthen who put up his sign 90
years ago.
Considering the gargantuan task, the visi-
tor on Monday found the new shop in won-
derfully perfect order. After the ground
floor was passed, the lifts —red-lacquered
within —dropped the explorer on to acres of
mossy carpets. On these stand counters that
look like tables, of Queensland maple or
walnut glowing like tropical islands with
colorful and glittering merchandise. These
great rooms are lined with Queensland woods
or Italian walnut polished till they resemble
still water through which the graining of the
wood seems to shine and slip like something
mirrored. The show-rooms, with discreet
alcoves where brides and debs, and just plain
women will preen, are exquisite with pen-
dant-crystal lamps, candle-sconces and pan-
elled walnut. Thea Proctor painted the
plaques on the white doors of the 70 tiny
beauty-boxes wherein Miss and Mrs. Sydney
will repair the ravages of the season. Mir-
rors are everywhere, and on the floor dedi-
cated to Peter Tinker toys to meet every
sort of taste are on view in queer old-
fashioned booths that have fancy ironwork
grilles before the windows. Just now there’s
a heavily-worked “slippery slide” and a
special motor-track.
What an indictment of the Australian
woman is the failure of Bond’s —-our very
own silk-stocking factory! Nothing short
of prohibitory import duties will keep our
women buyers away from the foreign silk and
near-silk hose. Bond’s stockings are fit for
a princess or a film star to wear; but for
years the shops have preached the superiority
of the imported article, and the flood of
American magazines that sap our national
spirit continues the insidious campaign.
And like flies we flutter into the web —and
then wonder why so many of our small
brothers and sisters must find an empty
stocking on Christmas morning.
Time cannot wither nor custom stale the
infinite variety of Lady Cowan. After
listening to her speaking about a dozen
times, this Letter places the lady witli the
nimble tongue as a positivist. There are
no “maybes” or “at-least-in-my-opinions”
about her verbal flights. She rolls up her
sleeves, makes an assertion and there you
are. Take it or leave it! “While we were
fighting, our cousins across the sea were
perfecting the machinery of the film in-
dustry,” she declared at the meeting of the
Good Films League at the Lyceum Club
the other night. This Letter doesn’t like
Uncle Sam’s blatancies on the silver screen,
but it does remember that it was an Ameri-
can poet who ivrote:
I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade;
and the writer kept that rendezvous, never
to march home again under the Star
Spangled. Banner. High hearts do not all
bear the brand “Made in England.” Of
course, many of the facts the speaker
stands and delivers are indisputable. At a
conservative estimate over 6,000,000 people
within the Empire go to the movies
annually, and it is time they demanded to
see more of their own nation’s exploits and
scenery.
Rose Hall was an inviting spot on the
only hot afternoon of last week. The Red
Crossers had picked that day to welcome
Dame Mary Cook, who is a vice-president
of the society, and the standard-bearers were
present in battalions. The Tom Hughes lady.
Miss Rose Piper, Miss Egan, Mrs. Mac-
kinnon, Mrs. Shepheard Laidley and chair-
man Russell Sinclair were among the
pointed-outs. The Dame, in her speech over
a barricade of presentation red carnations,
claimed to be the first woman in Australia
to hear of the declaration of the Great War.
It was when her husband was acting-Prime
Minister, and the message broke up a Sunday
afternoon siesta in that far-off 1914. A
special laudation was poured over our Junior
Red Crossers, who in membership and
efficiency come a close second to the Juniors
in America. Later on a great brew of tea
was circulated, and on the verandahs Mrs.
Wetton, a high priestess of the Juniors,
officiated over a sale of calendars and
cookery-books. Mrs. Walter Swinson, now
rarely heard in public, played piano works
by Russian and French composers, and the
afternoon was further sprayed with music
by Mrs. Graham (West Maitland), Mrs.
Cecil Scott and Doreen Graham.
A lucky young couple who passed through
Sydney last week were the Captain Alec
Stratford Cunningham Reids. Married in
May, the two have been honeymooning ever
since; Canada, the United States, Holly-
wood (which is No Man's land), the South
Sea Islands and Maoriland have all been
inspected by the good-looking pair, who are
now staying with the Stonehavens at Can-
berra. The captain—a mighty airman he
was in the Great War—is a member of the
House of Commons, and knew the G.-G.
when he was a Baird. Mrs. Reid is the
younger of the Ashley sisters, who inherit
the Cassel millions; the elder married Lord
Louis Mountbatten, who was here with the
Prince of Wales in 1920 —on the tour that
earned Halsey the nickname of Palsy,*
because he was perpetually shaking in his
boots over the. exploits of his young men-
agerie.
Fisli-scale flowers bound into posies were
one of the most interesting exhibits at last
week’s show of the Women’s Handicrafts
Association. The scales are capable of
being tinted in the deepest or most delicate
hues. The blue of the little cornflower
posies was particularly attractive. Fine
seams and exquisite embroideries were, as
usual, the feature of the exhibition in the
Education Gallery, and for the bride’s trous-
seau and baby’s outfit the work of these
artistic needlewomen would be hard to beat.
Tom Henley’s lady made the opening re-
marks, but so eager were buyers that even
before her speech the stalls were doing a
great trade.
When Ruby Rich, the good-looker in this
Ashby picture, leaves for Europe in Febru-
ary next,
women’s move-
ments in Syd-
ney will lose
a great leader
who special-
ises in presi-
dencies a n d
vice - presiden-
cies, and is a
high priestess
of the Femin-
ist Club. At
the moment
the tremen-
dous need for
a more wide-
spread interest
in. racial hy-
giene has cap-
tured her
energies. Al-
ready she has
helped the
strugg ling
little movement to its feet and given it a
fighting chance, and has taught hundreds
that this is not a subject for discussion only
among the medical community, but one of
vital importance to every man and woman.
The National Art Gallery is Howard Hin-
ton’s best girl, and his Christmas present to
her last week must have made every other
art gallery in Australia feel green. At his
hands liis love will be beautified by four
water-colors of Norman Lindsay’s, six oils
in the best Gruner manner and a still-life
by George Lambert. The Lindsay pictures
are: “Mutineers Attacking Francois Pel-
sart’s Ship off the West Australian Coast,”
painted 1909; “Garden of Felicity,” ex-
hibited in the Society of Artists’ exhibition
in 1921; “Harlequin or Pierrot” and “Play,”
the last two painted in 1926 and 1927. This
will bring the Norman Lindsay panel at the
Gallery to 14, the same number as the J. J.
Hilder panel holds. The Gruners cover a
period of 10 years in the work of perhaps
the most imaginative painter Australia ‘ has
produced since Hilder. George Lambert’s
finely painted “Tulips and Wild Hyacinths”
crowns the generous gift.
Dry ginger-ale sparkled merrily at the
TJ.S.A. Consulate on Thursday when the
descendants of the Pilgrim leathers met to
congratulate one another on still another rich
harvest. That great agricultural implement,
the vacuum, following on the industry of
“filluming,” can be depended on to steadily
absorb the root of evil on foreign soil, ar.d
the thanksgiving of Sydney’s colony was
fervent.
To start with, Uncle Sam’s citizens
attended a service at St. Stephen’s, at which
State-Governor Dudley de Chair was pre-
sent, and the end of the Perfect Day found
the Consular Lawtons and every American
known to the income-tax man either eating
turkey at the Wentworth or playing bridge
at one or other of half a dozen private
parties. The Church Hill hostelry was
bunched up with sheaves of golden grain
coquetting with crimson poppies, and the
stage simply groaned under its golden horn
of plenty. The dinner was served to the
tune of old darky songs, and in the glow
of the now so-fasliionable yellow candles.
Black lace patterned with gold thread formed
the frock worn by Mrs. Lawton, and about
the official board were grouped citizens whose
wives all flashed diamonds of the first water.
Governor of Fiji Sir Eyre Hutson brought
a party, mostly the Kemmis family, of which
Mrs. Brooke Francis, whose husband sells
law to Zanzibar, is a member. The two
were highlights in the merry-making, the
lady’s trail in the dance being blazed by
flame georgettes. Bertie Kelly (whose wife
hails from America) was present with young
Bertie, and was jocund in company with the
Colonel Bertrams and a group of young
things that included Susan Spencer, Mary
Langtree, Elizabeth Knox and Kate Ogilvic.
Frank Coffee came like a patriarch of old
surrounded by his family unto the third
generation. Captain Joe Trask and Captain
Hatfield were mariners of the Pacific who
stood at the salute while the star-spangled
banner w r as unfurled.
One mite had the good fortune to be
born into the community just in tiihe to be
baptised at the Thanksgiving service. The
parents—the “Texas Oil” Ivaulas —laid an
offering at the feet of the Republic’s patron
saint (or the nearest it has got to one) by
giving the infant Sam for one of its names.
Everybody has heard of the Irishman who
entered a restaurant ope Friday and ordered
shark. On being told there was none on
the menu, he sighed. “Well, bring me a
chop,” he said —“I must have fish of some
sort.” Now here’s the Thanksgiving Day
equivalent. A citizen of the United States
went into his cafe on Thursday. He had
had trouble with his bridge—not Bradfield’s,
but the one his dentist built for him.
“Turkey in the flesh I cannot eat, yet turkey
I must have,” he said to the waitress. Then
he flogged his brain to the problem. “Ah-ha.
I have it,” he said. “Bring me an omelet
made of turkeys’ eggs.”
Applause pelted down like rain on an iron
roof when Marie Burke made her reappear-
ance at the Criterion Theatre on Saturday
night; a blushing pink costume set off the
Gipsy-like charms of the lady, who was
making her first appearance without music
or dance. At the end of the performance the
audience insisted upon a speech; but Marie
made her remarks commendably brief. It is
nearly three and a half years since she
arrived as a vaudeville turn for the Tivoli
-—it was then that The Bulletin’s Show-
man suggested that the Firm might find in
her a leading woman for musical comedy.
The Firm turned its eyes that way, tried
her in “Wildflower” and has never repented
its act.
Sydney is losing its dancing-star taxi-
driver. He was Alexis Dolinoff, who stayed
behind when the Pavlova company left Aus-
tralia. A few vaudeville engagements petered
out early, and Dolinoff found that it took
time to build up a clientele for dancing
lessons. He has been giving these three days
a week; but to make real money he took
to driving a taxi-cab. Now Pavlova has
written offering him a place in her com-
pany again, and Dolinoff is boltingoff.
The Hugh Munros of Bingara transferred
their noted Keera hospitality to the Royal
Sydney Golf Club one night last week when
they entertained in celebration of daughter
Nancy’s marriage with Alex. Stratford
(Poss) Nivison, youngest son of the late
Jim Nivison, of Walcha. The nuptials had
been previously celebrated at St. Stephen’s.
The bride was as dainty as a sprig of white
heather in softly-falling georgette and
veilings of Brussels lace, and was followed
by two Barraba girls, Peggy Carter and
Bebe Walsh, replicas in rose save for the
court train and with tulle instead of lace
veils. Nancy’s brothers, Gordon and
Douglas, two famed polo players, were the
groomsmen. A stalwart piper skirled the
glad tidings across the golf links, preceding
the bridal procession to and from supper,
and his airs induced a few of the guests
to step a Scotch reel on the ballroom floor.
Mrs. Hugh, looking like the bride’s elder
sister, welcomed the guests with beaming
smiles, above pleats of copper georgette and
Vandykes of gold lace. The most honored
guest was the bride’s maternal grandmother,
Mrs. G. H. Gordon, picturesque in white lace
veiled with black. His pals seized and
carried the ’groom shoulder-high to the car
as the bridal pair were departing, with the
untiring piper still triumphantly preceding
them.
A son of Dr. Reid, of Watson’s Bay, who
was a victim of the Greycliffe disaster, was
married in All Saints’ Church last week to
Ida, daughter of the W. M. Reids, of Rose
Bay. The conventional trappings were sus-
tained by the bride, who was wrapped in her
mother’s wedding veil of tulle over Brussels
lace. Canon Langley tied the knot, which,
apart from its choral accompaniment, was
adjusted in sober fashion. A tall brother
of the equally tall bridegroom (they're giants
as their father was) w T as groomsman, and
Dr. Kent Burnett was best man. A small
family party later gathered at Arcadia, the
home of the bride’s parents.
Lottie Keyes, the girl in this May Moore
picture, is the pianist who made such a hit
at Walter Kirby’s concert. Her work is as
sympat he 1 1 c
an d sensitive
as her face,
and the three
songs from
her own pen
sung by the
t enor com-
pletely cap-
tured the
imagination of
the listeners.
They are to
be on sale at

“The Magic
Hour,” “The
Blind Lover”
a n d “Kind -
ness.” T h e
words of the
last were
written by
Leb b y Hor-
clem, who with his wife is starting off on
another world cruise.
W. A. Dettman handed eldest daughter
Grace up the aisle of St. James’s one night
last week, and Otto James, only son of the
Judge, claimed her at the altar, where she
knelt on a white satin cushion thoughtfully
brought for her by the embryo Raleigh in
a white satin suit who had led the wedding
party into the church. On ordinary days
the cavalier is small Jim Ryrie. A veil
which her father had brought from Brussels
enveloped the bride and melted into the
souffle of pink and white tulle train which
floated after the white georgette wedding
garment. The bride’s sister Edna was
attractively wrapped in silver tissue and
coral-pink tulle. The wedding meats were
eaten under a great bell of pink roses and
gypsophila at the Ambassadors, where the
tables were further beautified by standard
roses and low bowls of white watsonias.
All Saints’ at Hunter’s Hill will hold
among its pleasant memories the picture of
Nancy Titmus, who fluttered across its
threshold in ivory satins of clinging cut
misted over by mellow Limerick lace of
ancient weave. This not only formed the veil,
but was of such dimensions--as to create a
soft wash of train. The vision was attended by
two small girls like animated pink rosebuds,
while bride’s sister Dorothea and ’groom’s
sister Lois, also in pink chiffons and tulle,
followed demurely. Bride’s father, a Stock
Exchange chief, squired her to the rails, and
on a mounting wave of choral gladness the
group bore down on the waiting bridegroom,
Reginald John Hessel Linsley, who stood
alone save for best-man Fred Bell. The
bride’s parents launched a picturesque recep-
tion on a tide of Moet in the garden of
Tranby, their home at Hunter’s Hill.
This afternoon Margaret Osborne is being
wedded to Ellis Fielding Jones. Absolutely
classical is the swathe of the satin wedding-
frock, and the whole has been designed so that
the wearer shall resemble an ivory figure—her
pale-gold hair will help the illusion. To
gain the ivory tone necessary the satin has
been lined with gold. Three cousins—two
Osbornes and one Ackland (M.L.) —will
’maid in sea-blues under gold tissue ; and for
the first time at a Sydney wedding the fish-
tail trains will be demonstrated. The caps,
too, are Mercury-like things of gold net
with blue wings flat to the sides. Small
Betty Manning will be the train-bearer.
A learned Judge, speaking in England the
other day, expressed the hope that some day
Judges might be able to compel a wife to
divorce a husband from whom she sought
only a separation on the grounds of miscon-
duct. Well, but why should a model wife,
whose husband has been pirated from her,
and whose home has been broken up, be com-
pelled to make “an honest woman” of the
home-wrecker? If the unofficial wife has
eaten her cake, why should the law step in
to hand her a second, more handsomely iced
even than the first? If we are not careful,
the virtuous wife will some day replace the
mother-in-law as one of the nation’s standard
jokes.

THE COMPANY.
The Company was formed in July, 1926, to acquire the Com-
monwealth Patent Rights of the Hall Hydraulic Motor, and has
since been engaged in bringing to a state of marketable perfection
the present model Washing Machine driven by the Hall Motor. An
improvement to the original motor has been developed, the Com-
monwealth Patent Rights for which have been applied for. These
rights will be the property of the Company. In addition, several
unique features have been added to the machine.
PAST TRADING.
The first capital issue (£l 1,000) was limited to provide only
the capital necessary to purchase the various patents, perfect the
machine, and thoroughly test the market by—
(a) installing machines in a number of homes under ordi-
nary household conditions, and
(b) proving the demand for the machine by cash and
time-payment sales. After a 12 months’ trial the
Directors are satisfied that the estimates of trading and
profits given below are sound and moderate. They
are now in a position to recommend the investment
with confidence to the public.
REASONS FOR INCREASE OF CAPITAL.
The new capital is to be devoted to the purchase of stocks in
view of the apparent large and ready demand for the Washing
Machines, and to finance the sale of machines on the time-payment
plan. There are no bonus or promoters shares.
ESTIMATED PROFITS.
After a liberal allowance for all contingencies the Directors
estimate a net yearly profit of £1 4,000 on a turnover of 40 machines
per week. A full itemised statement and balance-sheet can be
perused at the Company’s offices, where any further information will
be given to intending investors.
The Company has the Patent Rights for the other States of
Australia under offer. A deposit has been paid on an option for
Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, the terms
of which it is not advisable to disclose in a Prospectus. Negotiations
are being conducted with another firm for the South Australian
rights. The purchase price of these patent rights represents over
60 per cent, of the capital now offered for subscription.

THE MACHINE.
The Wifesaver Washing Machine is operated by water,
the cheapest, simplest and strongest power known. This
power is obtained by connecting with the laundry water tap.
The hydraulic motor is exceedingly simple in construc-
tion and efficient in operation.
The fact that the Wifesaver boils the clothes as it washes
makes it the only machine on the Sydney market with this
essential advantage. The machine is made in gas or fuel
models.
Housewives appreciate its freedom from intricate
mechanical operation. Being non-electrical, there are no wires
to fuse, no motor to burn out, and no danger of shocks. A
half-turn of an ordinary water tap starts or stops the washer.
Clothes are washed, boiled, rinsed and blued without having
to be handled once. Delicate fabrics are washed without fear
of damage.
Independent engineers of repute endorse the finished
product, while testimonials and recommendations received
from users speak eloquently of the utility and the satisfaction
given in use.

THE MARKET.
Domestic labor-saving appliances which a few years ago were
unknown or considered luxuries are now deemed necessary in all
modern homes, and there are few articles to-day providing such
volumes of trade as these.
Electric and gas-irons, radiators and electric toasters illustrate
this. Vacuum cleaners have been selling in Sydney at the rate
of over 500 per month for the last two years, and show no sign of
diminishing business.
Difficulty in obtaining efficient laundry help has caused house-
wives to seek a remedy. High-priced, imported electric washing
machines are finding a ready market.
The low price of the Wifesaver, combined with the easy pay-
ment plan of purchase, opens up an enormous market. In Sydney
and suburbs alone there are over 300,000 homes, and houses are
being erected at the rate of nearly 10,000 per year.
Architects and builders speak in the highest terms of the
machine, and it is being recommended by the one and installed
by the other. Valuable space is saved, as only one small tub is
required, and an efficient laundry can be built on an area of 5 feet
square. The saving effected in materials, space and labor is greater
than the cost of the machine.

Sydney, N.S.W.
Dear SirS, —-
In accordance with your instructions, 1 have examined the
Wifesaver Washing Machine at your showroom, and also at the
works of the manufacturers.
The machine is of sound design, and should operate at a
maximum of efficiency and economy with a minimum of power
consumption. Owing to the simplicity of its construction, its upkeep
should be remarkably low.
Yours very truly,
(Sgd.) JAMES VICARS.
The Following Contracts are in Existence:—
The Company and Frederick G. Hall, dated 14th July, 1926,
re purchase of patent.

Chatter
People who motored to the Kooyong ten-
nis courts on Saturday afternoon to watch
iuter-State players discovered that tram and
train travelling has some advantages, for
parking space was at a premium and the
Glenferrie-road was lined on both sides by
petrol-waggons for half a mile or more.
Late arrivals, after the indignity of walking
quite a long way to the gates, found in many
cases that seats were unobtainable. The
big stone arena held about 5000 onlookers,
who, like the patrons of the old-style three-
ring circuses, watched three courts in play
at once. Daphne Akhurst, of N.S.W., was
one of the players who adopted the Lenglen
bandeau in place of a hat. She made a
most attractive, graceful figure in her white
silk sleeveless frock, her dark hair swathed
in flame-liued tulle. The Governor and Lady
Somers, with Lady Caroline Agar, saw the
last day’s play; auo the Tallis lady and her
daughter Biddy and Mrs. Norman Brookes.
The Herbert 'Brookes couple, Mrs. 11. S. K.
Ward, Mrs. G. Patterson, Elsa Andrew, Mrs.
E. Bo yes and her sister, Mrs. Nodrum, were
in Saturday’s throng.
Margaret Lawrence, the clever plump
little American lady who defies the fashions
by wearing her curly crop of fair hair
unshingled, wears pretty frocks effectively in
"Our Wife,” which opened at the Theatre
Roval on Saturday night. The star figures
firstly in a pale-blue ensemble gown with
additions of grey squirrel-fur, and later in
a cream-lace frock of cobwebby texture,
worn beneath a sable-collared pink-satin;
cloak. A lesser light charms the: eye. in a
confection of black with stray bands of white
fur and a front area of white chiffon,
allied to a folded toque of distinctive mode.
The house, enough hardly as full as is usual
on a first night, contained many well-known
society folk. In the r.s. were Admiral
Napier and his wife, Russell Clarke and
his life-partner, who wore a black lace gown ;
and Mrs. Colin Fraser, whose coiffured sil-
very locks shone above a lovely wrap. The
night was cold, and not many coats Were
shed. The Robert Knoxes, she in a dull-gold
coat, were in the d.c.; the John Taits looked
out from a managerial box, and Mrs. Wen-
man and a party occupied another com-
partment. The Fred Krcrouse couple, Hazel
Campbell, from Queensland, Madame de
Bavay and her daughter Marie and the
Philip Nunns were patrons.
At Government House during the week
Lady Somers showed approval of the
Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade by convening
a meeting to form a women’s auxiliary,
whose job it will be to provide victuals and
drink for the fire-fighters. Should Mel-
bourne’s wooded suburbs be visited by the
fire-fiend there is now a band of willing
recruits ready to strafe him. And behind
the lines will come the Comforts Corps with
billy and sandwiches. The Governor’s wife
accepted office as patroness, with the Morell
lady as president and Mrs. T. White and
Mrs. Harry Gullett as vice-presidents. Harry
Gullett, of course, was one of the originators
of the fire-fighting scheme. C. A. Poolman,
deputy efiairman of the V.8.F.8., who sug-
gested that a knowledge of first-aid and
snakebite treatment would form a useful part
of the equipment of women workers, elicited
murmurs of approval. The women Uni.
graduates, Toe H, League of Women Helpers
and other organisations have pledged them-
selves to send units into the field, so the
first call to action should find an adequate
commissariat department in being.
Pink roses and cerise sweet-peas in silver
bowls decorated the supper-tables at the Rex
one night last weea, when there was jazzing
in aid of the move to establish a permanent
orchestra. The end, apparently, justifies the
means, and the means justified themselves by
adding many hundreds of shillings to the pile
that is to be built up to a million —if enthu-
siasm holds out long enough. Raffles and sales
of carnival trifles were profitable side-lines.
The entertainments committee included the
chairwoman, Mrs. Herbert Brookes, whose
black gown had embellishment of gold thread ;
Mrs. Corrie Gardner, with a glitter of
sequins on a frock of gold lame and pale gold
georgette; Mrs. Philip Russell; and the
organising sec., Mrs. J. S. Winter. The hon.
sec. of the Junior Music-makers’ League,
Mrs. Marshall Wood, Esther Levy and
others helped. Madame Florence Ellis, who
accompanied Mrs. Brookes, topped a
beaded black-iace gown with a gold lame
bridge coat. Mrs. L. Wilkinson was an
attractive tignre in ombre georgette of roseate
hue, and Mrs. Philip Nunn looked well in
emerald green with gold lace and embroidery.
The two daughters of the Leslie Stuart
couple, just back from Europe, were dancers,
Nanette displaying faint pink georgette of
petal formation, and Lavender featuring
black georgette of semi-circular Bouncings
with a fruity-looking patterning of apple-red.
Sheila Morell chose poppy-liued georgette.
The State Government House at-home last
week was a private affair, a feature not at
all to the liking of some of the guests, it
may be suspected, for there’s not much glory
in enjoying v.-r. hospitality if the world
doesn’t know it. Invitations were limited
and carefully selected, and there were many
heart-burnings on the part of people who
thought they ought to have been bidden —
especially as Court mourning had cancelled
the usual Cup-week receptions—but were
not.
The feast-day of their Alma Mater’s
patron saint drew past and present students
of St. Catherine’s, Ileyington, Toorak,
together on Friday. At the annual meeting
of old pupils in the afternoon Betty Dick-
son took over the reins as president, with
Judy Finch as hon. sec. The head-mistresses,
Miss R. Langley and Miss F. Templeton,
bade their old girls welcome, and there were
presentations to Nellie Veitcli to mark
appreciation of her work as a teacher of
English diction on the occasion of her re-
tirement and prospective departure on a
holiday visit to the Cold Country.
Harry McClelland’s studio at Flemington
held a jolly party on Thursday night, when
his sister Nan, who acts as hon. sec. for a
group of freelance writers who call them-
selves the Derelicts, assembled members and
friends for song and dance. The big room,
which is on the lines of an old farm-house
kitchen, is a favorite rendezvous, and these
Bohemian festivities draw big crowds. Nan
McClelland can always be relied upon to
furnish something original in the way of
decoration and refreshments. Vegetables
were used to beautify the place on this occa-
sion, and the effect was utterly exciting.
The Women’s Automobile Club’s stall at
the Blind Institute’s Christmas fair, which
is to be held to-morrow and Saturday, will
be well stocked. To provide funds a dance
and bridge party, engineered by six nice
lasses, occupied the Ormond Hall one night
last week. The managerial sextette com-
prised Aubrey Dye, who had a dash of gold
upon an apple-green velvet robe ; Jean Clack,
with pink rosebuds on a blue taffeta frock;
Ida Scott, also in blue with a gleam of
crystal; Nell Murphy, radiant in silver
lame; May Sennitt, wearing pale gold with
a shimmer of silver; and Joy Lathlain, a
study in rose hue. There was an attendance
of about 25t).
This is Dr. Ann Macleod, who returned
to this city by the* Orama after completing
her studies in Dublin. She is a daughter
of the W. E.
Macleods o f
Latuma, and
the second
feminine Aus-
tralian to se-
cure the Dip-
loma of Gyn-
mcology and
Obstetrics
from Dublin’s
famous Ro-
tunda Hospi-
tal, the first
being Dr.
Beryl Oenone
Bowman, now
practising in
this city. Dr.
Macleod was
born at Essen-
don, and edu-
cated at the
Pres byterian
Girls’ College,
and she graduated in medicine at Melbourne
Uni. The desire to specialise came during
a term as resident doctor at the Queen Vic-
toria. Spencer Shier made the picture.
A display of needlework of a sort that
can’t he seen anywhere else these days
is always a feature of the annual summing-
up of the activities of the Ladies’ Work
Association. Mrs. MacDevitt, who manages
the depot, has encouraged her workers to
achieve designs of embroidery and other
fancy-work that they would never have dared
to tackle without her guidance. This year s
show includes not only beautiful lingerie and
articles for the linen-chest and glory-box,
but examples of the renovation and repair ot
delicate fabrics and lace. Vice-president Mrs.
Lauchlan Mackinnon kept the business meet-
in order. It was reported that the
financial position was satisfactory, a legacy
from the late Emily Payne of £5OO having
been a substantial help.
When Jess Belyea, only daughter of the
E L Belyeas of Mar Lodge, Toorak, ex-
changed vows with Alfred Lawrence Keep,
elder son of A. G. Keep, of Carn Brea, in
the same suburb, she wore georgette of deep
ivory tone, top-dressed with pale pink crepe
de Chine and adorned with silver fringe and
seed pearls. White tulle and Limerick lace
floated from a brow-band of pink-frosted
leaves, and an armful of white and pink
water-lilies completed the picture. Filmy
coverings of the hue of early wheat, with
felt hats of the same color, were worn by
the attendant ’maids, Dorothy Cowlishaw
and Joan Keep. There was merry making
afterwards at No. 9.
Janet Ross Hailey chose her home town,
Wagga, as the setting for her plunge into
nmtrimonv with Stanley Miller Robinson.
The bride entered St. Andrew’s in a cloud of
georgette shot with gold, with a mist of tulle.
Cousin Millie Lamont walked behind garbed
in apricot crepe de Chine and a black crin.
hat.
This young Australian, who has been win-
ning fame as one of the stars of the Italo-
Australian Grand Opera Co., chiefly in “II
Trovatore” and “Carmen,” is Elsie Wool-
ley. She won
her spurs at
South - street,
Ballarat,
where she
captured a
championship.
Her ambition
lies in the
direction o f
the concert
platform, and
her recent suc-
cesses in opera
haven’t altered
it, though she
admits the ex-
perience has
been invalu-
able. Count
Filippini heard
her sing four
years ago, and
needing a
mezzo-soprano
fer his operatic ventures offered to train her
for various roles, an offer that was promptly
accepted. Miss Woolley is an Adelaide girl
and comes of musical stock. A brother is
with her in the opera co. Lafayette made
the picture.
On Thursday night at the Toorak Presby-
terian Church Jeanne Laidlaw, wearing
raiment qf ivory satin with a veil of Lim-
erick lace, exchanged marital vows with
Hector, eldest son of Dr. and Mrs. Edgar
Barrett, of St. Hilda. The bride, who is
the only daughter of the George Laidlaws,
of Taviton, Inverell (N.S.W.), had maidens
three in attendance, robed in a rainbow
effect of mauve, blue and apricot, with silver-
trrey crin. hats. No. 9 saw the after-revels.
The Music Club now gives its concerts in
the reception-room of the Lyceum Club, a
change for the better. On Thursday night
there was a full hoiiss to listen to the Haydn
D major and Schubert A minor quartettes,
which were played admirably. On this occa-
sion Hope Scott, an earlier member of the
combination, took the place of second violin
Myrtle Robertson. With Bertha. Jorgen-
sen as lead these young Australians are
doing much to create interest in chamber
music. Ida Walker’s expressive contralto
voice was heard in a group of Schumann
songs, and a cheery tinkle of teacups at
the finish was melodious to many, for the
night was cold. The Spencer lady, Dr. and
Mrs. J. F. Rudall, Mrs. Edith Smart, Mrs.
George Dickson and Lucy Rowe were among
the listeners.
The Albert-street Con. concert in the
Assembly Hall on Friday night had unex-
pected v.-r. patronage, Lady Somers’s rose-
splashed black shawl being a bright spot in
the front row. Melba was there, too, with
a silvery coat covering a gown of pale-amber
georgette, and the diva’s ‘‘bravos” rewarded
a fine performance of part-songs by Gustav
Holst. Mrs. E. 11. Davidson was with the
Governor’s wife, and within the circle of the
elect were Mrs. George Armstrong, Major
Henty, the Fritz Harts, the Geoffrey Heath
couple, Mrs. Albert Miller and the Masson
lady. The only flowers that materialised
during the evening were posies of roses for
her Ex. and Dame Nellie.
During the absence of Ellison Spowers on
a wander in Asia Mrs. Stanley Addison
will take over the job of general secretary
to the Victoria League. The executive com-
mittee of the league gathered in the dining-
room of the Alexandra Club during the week
to drink a parting cup with Mies Spowers,
Mrs. J. S. Fraser, as senior vice-president,
being cast for the rdle of hostess. A gift
of perfume hidden in a bower of blossom was
a remembrance-offering. The Maudsley and
Mitchell ladies, Mrs. David Grant and Mrs.
E. Lascelles helped to do honor to a hard-
working officer.
Genial Helen Gillan, secretary of the
W.C.T.U. for nearly iO years and hon.
assist, sec. of the National Council of Women
for five years, boarded the Hobson’s Bay
last week to have a look at the City of Fogs
and visit relatives in Ireland. The W.C.T.U.
gave her a great send-off, and the -executive
of the N.C.W. made a special brew to pass
over a cheque, a posy of pansies and many
good wishes.
Zillah Bateman, who has returned to us
nursing a strained heart, has been ordered
by the doctors to take a rest. So she is
meditating a visit to wee daughter Anne,
left in the care of friends in England. Two
years have elapsed since the parting and
only a brief stay can be managed, as the
mother must resume her job in March. It
doesn’t sound a very restful sort of holi-
day.
Even the Parliamentary press galleries
are now being invaded by skirted journalists.
Decently one wearing a cardinal jumper aud
looking business-like without a hat listened
and wrote up her copy as she went along in
the Leg. Council gallery, which is slightly
above the level of the floor. Last week
another one representing a Melbourne daily
sat in the centre of the Assembly gallery
wearing her hat and a walking-dress. She
took notes for a sketch. Gallery men hold
the view that the gallery woman should leave
her hat outside. At any rate the girl in the
Uppah Chambah established a . precedent.
It might be pleaded that as prayers are
said in the Council chamber the wearing
of a hat by a woman was correct. No
prayers are recited in the Assembly, and
members are entitled to wear their tiles in
that House, but don’t as a rule. Chief Sec
I’rendergast is an exception.
The Norman Brookes couple on Sunday
entertained some visiting and local tennis
players at Cliff House, their seaside resi-
dence, situated between Mornington and
Frankston. The State Governor and Lady
Somers, she in floral chiffon frock with bois-
de-rose hat, joined the jolly party. Mrs.
Lrookes wore a jumper suit in a tone of
cyclamen. Bridge, a splash in the surf,
tennis and tea amused the guests, who in-
cluded Mrs. Akhurst and daughter Daphng,
from N.S.W.; the V. E. Page couple, of
Tasmania; Norman Peach, J. Crawford,
Esua Boyd and Mrs. R. R. Harper.
The farewell concert of mezzo-soprano
Viola Morris and contralto Victoria Ander-
son drew a full house. The songbirds are
products of the Harold Browning couple’s
studio, and they sail in about a fortnight's
times for Fogtown and a polishing course.
Their offering of songs, ancient and mpdern,
was supplemented by Louise Gargurevich at
the piano, Gwen Prockter with her ’cello,
the Rita Hope instrumental trio, Beatrice
Ternan, known over the wireless as Mary
Gumleaf, and some other artists.
Alma Gluck, the American singer who
visited these parts with her husband, violin-
ist Zimbalist, took back with her to her two
children a black-and-tan terrier pup, bred
by Mrs. Fritz Hart, who is one of our lead-
ing fanciers. The dog became such a
favorite on the voyag.3 that the passengers
gave it a farewell gift of a gold collar.
Mrs. Ronald McDonald and Eveline Syme
were joint hostesses at the Alexandra Club
on Thursday afternoon, when good-byes and
good wishes were showered on Beatrice
Henty, booked to face the altar with G. F.
Blandy, of Austinmcr (N.S.W.), this week
The drawing-room was decorated with
vari-colored blossoms and white lilies. The
bride-elect, who got a C.B.E. for her services
in war-time, wore a floral-patterned gown
and an ecru hat that supported a feathered
mount. Mrs. McDonald was frocked in
black and white, and Miss Syme topped a
fawn dress with a large crin. hat.
A Canberra note :
The dance given by the students of the School
of Forestry at Westridge—it followed the official
opening of the school by the G.G. —was a very cheery
affair, albeit the setting was a bit unusual. The
dimly-lighted octagonal reception hall, very dignified
with its rich panelling and parquetry of Australian
hardwoods, was used as a lounge. The museum,
cleared of its glass cases and decorated with colored
lights, shrubs and huge bowls of red roses, made an
excellent ballroom. Glass-rooms were available for
bridge, and supper was served in the laboratory, the
guests perching themselves on tall stools round the
high chemistry benches. C. E. Lane-Poole, acting-
director of the school, did the honors, aided by
Mrs. Gray.
“A.G.M.’s” note from London: —
In an old-world room overlooking Lincoln’s Inn
Gardens, and facing the famous kafalca-tree under
whose branches Bacon wrote his Essays, a Mel-
bourne woman had an Australian tea-party a few
days ago. Thirty years back she was known as
Gertrude James, the daughter of a clergyman and
the niece of another. On coming to England she
married her cousin, Edward Peterson, the son of a
clergyman. Her husband is the leading authority
on the complicated question of Tithes, and by his
efforts he has put nearly two millions of money
into the pockets of the English clergy. The Peter-
sons have one son, John, a B.A. of St. John’s,
Cambridge, and a good platform speaker and writer.
Writing runs in the family, as Winifred James, of
“Bachelor Betty” fame, is Mrs. Peterson’s sister.
Among the guests at the party were Mrs. Rogers
and her sisters Ethel and Alice Dare, of Melbourne,
just returned from Penzance, where they had the
unusual experience of picking up precious stones off
the Cornish beach when the tide was low —amethysts,
topaz and crystals. This week they set off homeward
via Vancouver with two Australian friends.

The Goodwins, accompanied by the Camp-

just now. Even the little gardens are nose-

Ashton Murphy read a paper by Lance

Lawson’s bush pictures too seriously. He
• also gave “A Lesson in Battling” by “Tar-
boy” (Grierson Brown), and Jack Mathieu’s
“That Day at Boiling Down.” There were
refreshments and music.
The United Service had a dance, on the
same night, with supper in the billiard-room,
and flags and palms as background. Pretty
Doris O’Mahoney was amongst the dancers.
For the Clayfield Memorial School of
Arts, Mrs. Spencer Browne and Mrs. V. H.

Though the Elwick course was looking, its
best and the weather was perfect, the crowd
was smaller than usual, as there were several
counter-attractions that day. His Ex. was
present, and was received and tea-ed by the
president and Mrs. Lyons, but Margaret
O’Grady had to open a fair. The new calf-
skin trimming made spots and patches on
coats and handbags, and all save their proud
owners declared that they were hideous.
Tailored costumes held their own. Veils
made their reappearance and looked very
becoming, worn over small hat-brims.

Burgess and many more listened to the

ing frock of printed georgette.
Mrs. Henry Dobson, ; having finished her
33rd trip to Europe, has returned home as
fit and fresh as ever, and has much to say
of her experiences at Geneva, where she and
Mrs. Robert Hall, both Tasmanians, took
part in various conferences concerned with
social welfare. Mrs. Dobson had power to
act for the Australian representative, Lady
Forster, had occasion arisen.
News comes from London that Kathleen
Moore has promised herself to Lieut. Mas-
ters Norman. The bride-elect’s forebears are
among the best-known of Hobart’s old fami-
lies, her mother having been the daughter.of
the late Canon Hudspeth. The happy man,
who is attached to the senior service, has
many friends on this side of the line. He
was here in the Dunedin three years ago,
and met his fiancee at her home in Hobart.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
The pleasant face round which this para-
graph drapes itself belongs to Helene Adelia,
better known here as Helene Taylor, an
Adelaide girl
who took her
fine soprano
voice to Lon-
don five years
ago for a final
polish. Now
she has re-
turned to h e r
native city for
a brief vaca-
tion before re-
suming her
studies in
England, and
has been
warmly wel-
comed by the
musi c-lovers.
She was one
of the stars of
the Royal
A o a d e m y’s
final concert
last season,
when she sang with full orchestral accom-
paniment under the baton of Sir Henry
Wood. Last Saturday she gave a recital
at the Town Hall, and more than fulfilled
the expectations of those who assisted her to
realise her ambitions. Her voice is particu-
larly sweet and clear, and her years of hard
study have given her a perfect technical
mastery of her art.
Mayoress Bruce’s last week at the Town
Hall has been a busy one —morning tea for
the S.P.C.A. executive and tlie workers for
the society’s ball, whose harvest of £3BO was
handed over to the president; more morning
tea for the English croquet players (who
have been full of praise for two of our
players, Mrs. Dorman and Mrs. Bartle) ;
and a final afternoon when the Mayoress, in
blue georgette with a hint of pink, said her
good-byes in a room that fairly rioted with
roses, gladioli and delphiniums. Mrs. Lav-
in gton Bonython is to be her successor.
Margaret Clieadle was married the other
day to Paul McGuire, so that in future two
bright Bulletin contributors will be able to
dip out of the one inkpot. The wedding was
of the quietest, date and place being known
only to a few of their most intimate friends.
Dr. Davies, bound for England on short
leave, farewelled members of the staff in his
own rooms at the Con. the day before he
sailed. There were some speeches and an
interchange of presents; some for Dr.
Davies and some, from the staff jointly, for
Sylvia Whitington and George Pearce, whose
wedding is near.
The Gallery is rejoicing in the possession
of a Royal Worcester vase, presented by the
Brookman lady, whose late husband was a
connoisseur of china with a special fondness
for Worcester. The vase, by George Owen, is
a particularly fine one, and with it goes a
loan collection of pictures and more china.
A letter from oversea tells of the Talbot
Smiths and the George Deans at Skyep
where they were the guests of the Seton-
Watsons, and at Walsall in Staffordshire,
which was Edwin Smith’s old home. Both
couples are due back in Adelaide in mid-
January.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
The arrival of Betty Ross Clarke and her
fellow-mummers made a great stir. Mem-
bers of the Green Room Club got busy, with
tea, cakes and music to welcome the inmates
of the “House of Glass,” and all sorts of
social affairs are being arranged in their
honor.
Albert Lynch, a Perth boy who has been
studying the violin abroad, is off to the
Eastern States and then back to Europe,
after a short stay here. He gave a very suc-
cessful recital in the Town Hall.
Max Pauer, the Leipzig maestro, who paid
Eileen Joyce the honor of accepting her as a
pupil, has written enthusiastically to Prof.
Ileinze, of Melbourne Con. Pauer reckons
the young lady will without doubt be the
greatest woman pianoforte virtuoso of the
world—a bold prophecy with Carreno still
alive.
The R. O. Law couple are off on a jaunt
again, this time to Malaya and other Eastern
lands. Daughter Muriel goes, too, but hopes
the trip ,will not be too long, as wedding gar-
ments will be waiting for her as the bride of
Malcolm, of the Plaistowe clan.
The wedding of pretty Sheila Durack and
Reg Summerhayes was one of the big social
events of the week. St. Pat’s Church on
West Perth hill was full to overflowing, and
the Savoy Hotel was the rendezvous for
hundreds of guests. Sheila looked beautiful
in her bridal array, and her mother still more
beautiful in an ensemble costume of wine-
shaded chenille georgette. Old goldfield
friends of the parents on both sides figured
among the guests.
The C.W.A. had a celebration at the sea-
side homes this week. The Pliilp lady opened
the fete in the playroom, which was decked
with flags and balloons.
Mrs. F. H. Mendoza, who was associated
with Girton College here for many years,
has been paying us a visit. Her husband
is a notable tenor singer, and their only
daughter, Doris, is now one of the Firm’s
orchestral pianists.

H.V.W.: Can’t you end it better?....
H.D.W.: You’ve chosen subjects that are worn to
rags.'.. . E.D.: “Wisdom” deserves to have its weak
lines tonicked... .A.M.M.: Just lacked the strength
to pull itself in. But it has virtues —especially the
great merit of sincerity.... H.W.: That page is
critical, and only to a very small extent biographical.
| . ...T.A.S.: “Hashed were the hopes of the reader.
' Dashed too were the hopes of the Director and the
I Star.” And dashed, also hanged and blowed, was
1 the story which began so promisingly and ended so
feebly... .C. 8.8.: Avoid the sententious style....
0.A.H.: The dog fight was a tame brawl... .Jno. S.
(Q.) : Correction laid to rest with the body. (Neither
mattered) ... .Helen F.: If, instead of writing verses
by the yard, you were careful of their feet, you
would do better... .A.G.M.: The combination can
be guessed too early.... T.J.8.: Wish the thoughts
had been as clear as the handwriting. .. .Wm. C.:
Tedious repetition.... Moyal K.: “Starving Stock”
too bloodless.... K. I. T.: Immature... .Fred O.: Not
quite... .R.W.J.: Eve's apple gave us the pip....
M. : Said “Whoa!” to the Carbine item....lda
B.: The form employed is inadequate to the subject.
... .Aitchsee: “Um”—humph !... .C.McE.: Well
told, but based on unreality. The policeman who
couldn’t find out the two-up joint would be an
imbecile —the difficulty would lie in catching it....
Herb G. F.: Too far-fetched... .11.L.T.: Amend-
ment wouldn’t save the verse. Typing is not essen-
tial... .Ursula C.: Don’t know what it’s all about,
but here’s some of it:—
Though hot pulses might burn,
And though spectres of losses
Fronted you at each turn,
Denied you her mosses.
. ...F.W.H.: Too many lines are merely bad prose.
....Philo: Both very near. .. .G.B.P. (Bacchus
Marsh): That pen-name is mortgaged.... A 1 Koran:
“Fortune” added a “Miss” to its name.... Helen P.:
You slip at the point of achievement... .J.E.P.:
Good description covers no real tale. ... J.8.R.: And
you imagine “state”-“shape” and “task”-“last” are
rhymes!... .J.F.C.: Rubaiyat of the car had carbu-
retter trouble.... Dark Horse: Neigh... .F.A-B.:
You take 100 words to say “Short of cash, he
had to look for a job.” Par. value only in a
I couple of : them. ... M.R.C.: That carry-over from
stanza to stanza makes a wearisome 10ad... .Pommy:
The advice is good; the verse is horrible... .Dad:
“Home” is a jiggy affair... .Les C. McL.: Im-
mature...-. Gil E.: Bad writing made your descrip-
tion of it look like “a shot story.” And it read
like 0ne.... J.8.M.: There’s no plotting out of
your idea. That is necessary.... Cuthbert P.: Truly
terrible.... Z.V.W.: Tremulous little tale.... Kilcoy:
Too obviously manufactured.... Loraine L.: Your
inspiration isn’t inspiring... .R.D.M.: Lacks finish,
so we finished it... .T. 8.: It’s really pathetic:-—-
He’s where the fat pigs slumber,
Where the glow-worm wriggles and creeps;
Under the mulbry tree,
That’s where my magpie sleeps.
The cat they call Young Johny
He did, upon my word,
One morning for his breakfast
He pounced upon the bird.
Just now I’m sadly thinking,
As I see the old disc plough,
Of the wire cage that’s empty
For I have no magpie now'.
. ...J.F.T.: The dirge is merely a doleful repetition
of the facts.... Ray J.: We found the essay on
comedy particularly dreary.... Edward G.: The dead
Chow will remain dead....W.T.W.: You’re a late
bird, with your song of October !... .Marjorie C. B.:
Get rid of the notion that you can slip in any make-
shift line with a rhyme in it when you want to
finish... .F.W.M.: Far too long. . . .Alast: The
“Walking Poem” will walk home unless you send
the fare. .. .Marie M.: Very nearly.... Daphne
McK.: An old model love yarn not at all in our line.
. ...Milsons: You have a delicate ear; it hears
rhyme in “ladies”-“babies” and “seats”-“feet”. .. .
N. : Sticky sentimentalism.... Kenn : The “loom”-
“bloom”-“gloom” verse gone to its d00m.... Donna
M. (Oodnadatta) : Slight... .Elouera: Why scorn
your verbs ?....H.N.S.: The sense is too hard to
find. .. . Troubador: The artist discovered the lady of
his dreams and she told him he was trespassing.
Alas... .A.L.H.: Must the waves be “crimsoned”
when people are just drowned ?, ... Fossicker: We
liked your assurance that Australia’s sons will
spring to arms:—
Like unto the young bullpup
As nature is w'hen blood is up.
... . J.A.K.: Not well enough t01d... .M.McC.:
Good efforts, that’s a 11... .P.K.P.: The land deal is
off again.... .P.R.M.: Dull politics in verse are no
good. They’re no good out of verse, either....
Ray T.: Not convincing enough. .. .R.R.H. : Joins
the overflow.... Jack M.: We nearly got a headache,
too. . . .Bellerive: Good ; a little bit of natural his-
tory this time: —
From its w r eb towards the ceiling
Upon my bedroom w r aH,
For exercise a spider
To and fro will crawl.
It never ventures further
Than above the window pane;
At night, if it emerges
’Tis a sign ’tis going to rain.
Victims to the hermit,
Many flies of summer fall;
A very quiet lodger
Is the spider on the wall,
It is a span it liveth,
Whate’er its reign may be;
Though dreaded as a viper
’Tis no enemy to me.
....Jessie M.: Humor of that sort can’t afford to
go to sleep for whole paragraphs... .France S. G.:
“Cuckoo” lays no egg in this nest.... Nora C.: Not
for us J.H.McE.: A black-out H.C.C.: The
overdone mumbo-jumbo spoils your melodrama....
E.T.E.: Why wander to South Africa ?... .K.M.:
We simply hate animals that talk all about them-
selves... .L.E.: Close up....H. Maule, Pearl E.R.,
T. J.M.: You only crashed on the second time round,
too.... Chas. H.: You take him too seriously. But
that’s a capital touch about the old bridge....
J.P.: Sorry, can’t see where it would fit in....
R.F.T.: Ditto... .Geo. 11. B.: We’ll do more; we’ll
probably offer to buy their serial rights Bay
W.: Now forget that you’re writing for a paper and
tell the wharfie’s story in plain words.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
R.M.: The tin-hare gag is rusty, and the drawing
is weak.. . .P.D.: Dad should have walloped the
artist instead of his offspring. .. .H.S.: Sketch of
cow-farmer branding and earmarking his progeny
declined... .A.W.0.H.: You didn’t get enough steam
up to carry the jokes.... S.C.: You are not breaking
down as early as in previous attempts... .E.D.:
Impossible.
THE INKY WAY.
“Lao-dah”: Bloomers aren’t the exclusive
monopoly of the politicians. The S.A.
Register once finished up a vigorous leader
with “the present socialistic tendencies of
Labor will convert the submerged tenth
into a submerged twentieth.”
“Hamer”: Pat Sullivan, black and white
man and caricaturist, shortly returns from
Yankeeland for good. Pat, before lie went
overseas, found a good part of his income by
making small sketches of boxers and other
notables, which he sold to hairdressing
saloons ; and he had some varied experiences
in Uncle Sam’s country before striking
fortune with “Felix the Cat.” But fortune,
when it did come, came with a rush.
“Lens” : Bulletin photographer Monteath
is the only camera-man in Australia who is
entitled to dangle on his watch chain the
gold medal of an International Photographic
Exhibition certifying that lie beat all comers.
The exhibition was held in Britain in 1S95.
Its companion on the watch chain is a medal
of the Melbourne Art Club signifying that
the holder won the first prize for a water-
color painting in 1896.
“Simon”: Add to the flowers of Par-
liamentary speech that have found their way
to tlie press gallery a remark by old Jim
Gormley, sometime member for Wagga,
N.S.W. “I’ve seen the Murrumbidgee a mile
wide, Mr. Speaker,” he declared, “and I’ve
seen it alive with dead cattle.”
“Spare Sub”: To the Parliamentary
howlers culled from gallery notebooks in
N.S.W. and Victoria (B. 17/ll/’27), let
me add the following from my native
Queensland: —
It is all very fine to try and paint the lily, but
the lily cannot be painted with a £2,000,000 deficit.
This dead hand of Socialism, growing year by
year, which is causing a festering sore, should be
removed.
The hon. gentleman is like the ostrich who sticks
his head in the sand and defies the public.
But the Parliamentarian isn’t always to
blame. Writer recalls one individual who
wound up a “personal explanation” to the
House by expressing the hope that he had
“purged himself.” Hansard added insult
to humiliation by making it “perjured him-
self!”
“Murkah”: There is only one older news-
paper than the West Australian, viz., the
S. M. Herald, born April, 1831. The Perth
Gazette and West Australian Journal
commenced on January 5, 1833. The
Adelaide Register followed, the first number
printed in London on June 18, 1836. It was
nearly 12 months before the second number,
printed in Adelaide, appeared. The Bris-
bane (originally Moreton Bay) Courier
began in 1846.
“X.N.O.”: Herewith my experience as a
Bulletin contributor (B. 17/ll/’27). I
started just over four years ago with a
bunch of pars., one of which got in. Since
then I have appeared on the Red Page, the
leader page, Plain English, Political, Society,
"Wild Cat, Personal, Aboriginalities, Smoke-
oli, Sporting, Business-Robbery, Woman’s
Letter, Inky Way, Poverty Point and tin;
fll-ups. A short , story and an alleged poem
were unplaced. It may not be a record, but
it’s not a bad achievement for an ex-naval
officer, for much of the stuff has been any-
thing but nautical.
“Trepex”: As a freelance I find myself
indebted to The Bulletin for needful ser-
vice as well as pin-money (B. 17/ll/’27).
During last winter the old “Hop” cheque
very nearly kept me going in my regular dues
to the masseuse who is treating one of my
kiddies for a curvature of the spine. If the
bulk of the masseuse’s cheque has now to be
made up out of my ordinary screw, that is no
fault of The Bulletin. The rigors of the
wool season do not leave one much room
for scribbling.
“XX”: I remember seeing the first letter
written by “Smiler” Hales in his capacity of
a war correspondent. It was dated from a
troopship at Albany (W.A.) early (I think)
in 1900, and for some reason was never pub-
lished by the goldfields paper to which it
was addressed. What struck me most about
it was the indifferent spelling. Later the
dropping out of the London Daily News
correspondent gave “Smiler” his chance, and
he was soon revelling in purple patches.
But he had his work cut out to reach South
Africa at all, for at that time he was prac-
tically out of regular journalism and was
licensee of a small pub in Coolgardie.
“B.D.T.” : I am beginning to regard my-
self as a journalistic Jonah, for every paper
which has secured by services during the
last eight years has gone phut. I was on
the staff of Melbourne’s Evening Sun
throughout the two years of its troubled
existence, after which" I joined the ancient
Punch, which quietly expired eight months
later. My board was next paid by the
Morning Post (R.I.P.). My earliest jour-
nalistic efforts were made for Australia, a
post-war monthly review published in Mel-
bourne and subsequently swallowed up by
Youth. About the same time I was a regular
contributor to the ill-ctarred Midnight Sun.
I only trust The Bulletin will feel no. tre-
pidation in publishing this par.
PIN MONEY.
[Foit The Bulletin.]
You like the wife’s new hat? Oh, yes. She
got it at a sale ;
She touched me on her birthday for a quid.
I happened to be flush because I’d landed
with a tale;
And what she did not bust upon her lid
1 spent on paint—don’t touch the fence —to
beautify our home.
That lounge-chair—you can sit there while
I talk —
I bought last week. My luck was in. 1
placed a snifter pome.
With racy pars I paved the concrete walk.
Here, try a good cigar, old cheese. Don't
spoil your lungs with fags.
There’s plenty more. I’ve got a box. Oh,
no;
My birthday-tree has died. I struck it lucky
with some gags. ...
Whassat? A carV We-ell. . . .wait a

How often have you asked your companion that question
when, on a pitch-dark, rainy night, miles from anywhere
and uncertain of your exact location, you have been com-
pelled to stop your car and strain your eyes in a vain effort
to decipher the words on a cross-roads signboard?
Finally you have been obliged to get out and strike a
match or back the car round so as to bring its head-
lights to bear on the indistinguishable letters.
WAS IT WORTH THE TROUBLE, when a WINCHESTER
No. 6821 FOCUSSING TORCH —which throws a clear
beam of brilliant light to a distance of 100 yards—might

The last touch
of elegance...
From time immemorial beautiful
women have worn beautiful je-
wels. Yet it is given only to the
happy twentieth century woman
to wear the most practical and
useful and elegant jewel ever in-
vented by the genius of man. Your
own jeweller will tell you that
for that last touch to your adorn-
ment you cannot do better than
choose a jewel with a tiny yet
sturdy and conscientious machine
inside it, in fact an Omega.

• Loos’s “The Whole Town’s Talk-
iug, which opened at Sydney Criterion
on Saturday, is a pleasurable farce, unusu-
ally rich in improbabilities. These include
a middle-aged wife who, having discovered
evidence of her husband’s philandering, only
remembers her anger when it is required
to speed up the action of the play and a
lover so timorous that, when asked whether
he would like to marry the girl of his heart,
he can only stammer, “Yes, please.” This
ludicrously simple being has achieved bv
talents nowhere apparent in the play a part-
nership in a wealthy firm. His partner’s
idea is to make a match between his daughter
and the gawky young man, and to give
the latter a glamorous appeal in the lady’s
eyes it is decided to create for him a Roman-
tic Past. Unfortunately the film star
chosen to provide the Past turns up with
a belligerent adorer just after the faked
romance has set the whole town talking; her
arrival, with a determination to make Ches-
ter Binney pay for his audacity by declar-
ing that the fiction is fact, makes a medley
of confusion from which the usual screams
are extracted:
* * »:= *
R. Barrett-Leonard handles the part of
the timorous ass, Chester Binney, with a
cleverness which wins sympathy for a man
•who, by the usual canons, should have been
a mere laughing-stock. His claims to the
warm regard of Henry Simmons, the paint-
manufacturer, seem mainly built upon his
willingness to look after the business whilst
George Blunt chases strange skirts. Blunt,
although as usual very much George Blunt,
gets all the humor possible out of the
character of the bluffing, perfidious husband.
Rosie Be Varde is the comfortable pleasant-
faced wife, who is not over keen upon exact-
ing a reckoning for conjugal infidelity; many
a husband will be moved to take his wife to
the show with the hope that she may accept
the complacent Harriett Simmons as an
example of the way injured wives should
behave. Marie Burke, not set to music on
this occasion, makes a picturesque episode
of the film star’s determination to have
retribution from the man who has built a
Romeo reputation upon the use of her name;
Thelma Burness is an attractive Ethel Sim-
mons, who has two friends to help her show
the things that appeal to the heart of Flapper-
dom ; both Phoebe Martyn and Una Dysart
brightly emphasise the flapper habit of all
speaking together and using shrieking super-
latives, and whichever of the two it is that
decorates her. soda-siphon conversation with a
lisp does it particularly well. Leyland Hodg-
son is the film star’s jealous adorer; his
most convincing moments are those of
drunkenness. Others deserving of mention
are Daphne Deane as a too-flaunting Sadie;
Frank Deighton, the spare lover necessary to
stress the successful man’s victory; and
Mary Anderson, a slavey who does not
trouble to conceal the feminine enthusiasms
that beat beneath the white apron of domes-
tic service.
* * * *
“What Happened to Jones” at Sydney
Opera House can be counted as amongst
the worst sins that Frank Neil has com-
mitted. The attempt to bring the old favor-
ite up-to-date by rambling outside the old
lines only cheapens the play ; and there is
no reason whatever for attaching to it an
ill-fitting gag from “The Gay Lord Quex.”
Frank Neil is, of course, the Jones of the
production—the racy hymn-book merchant
who, having fallen foul of the police in one
of his gay adventures, takes refuge in the
home of his friend Goodley, and hides in the
garments of the Bishop of Ballarat, which
have arrived in advance of their saintly
owner. Victor Fitzherbert is the escapee
from the lunatic asylum who helps to make
complications for Jones. Fred Stephenson
is Ebenezer Goodley; Jefferson Taite a
bishop with a rather impressively impossible
sense of dignity; and Paul Plunkett makes
a success of Richard Hatherley. Miss Better-
ton Glover represents Alvina Starlight, the
lady with the usual feminine adoration of
such things as bishops, and Sylvia McNair
is Mrs. Goodley; the parts of the girls,
Marjorie Goodley and Cissy, Goodley’s ward,
fall to May Moore and Mabel Gaven.

The Repertory Society introduces a
fortnight’s season to Sydney Palace Theatre
on Saturday night with Galsworthy’s “The
Show” for an opening bill: George Bernard
Shaw's “Tlie Philanderer” will be substi-
tuted on the following Saturday. At Her
Majesty’s “Castles in the Air” are shortly
due to vanish, but it depends on the appre-
ciation accorded to "The Whole Town’s
Talking” whether the date of the revival
of “Wildflower” will be December 10 or
17. _ Marie Burke and co. are, of course,
required for that popular bloom. Similar
considerations affect the date of the arri-
val of "The Cuckoo in the Nest,” which
will take possession of the Criterion Theatre
when the change-over is effected. “The
Terror” goes on its hair-raising way at the
Royal. "Tweekie” continues to gladden the
Empire management with its box-office
returns ; and “Archie” keeps the St. James
full.
>:-• * * *
Fullers’ Theatre (Sydney) audiences are
being regaled this week by the back-fence
squabbles of Mrs. McQuibble and Mrs.
McCann, Jim Gerald being the last-named
lady. The Woolloomooloo-Irisli episode is
the funniest thing thrown into the new pro-
gramme ; Betty Lambert scores a particular
hit as the prodigal daughter of Jim Gerald.
The revue end of the bill is called “A
Millionaire for a Night,” and is rich in
laughs, of which Reg Hawthorne, as a
pessimistic hotel engineer, gets many.
* * * :J:
Sydney Tivoli has changed its bill in a
sweeping fashion, although two old friends
are included in the change—Dick Henderson,
back for a farewell season and showing him-
self as clever an entertainer as ever, and
Harmston’s Cockatoos. The avian cast in-
cludes “The Colonel,” a white bird which
has retired from the army and taken to
accountancy, and another fowl which plays
“Home Sweet Home” on the bells. The best
of the absolute newcomers is Tom Katz and
His Saxophone Band. It is a pity that the
management did not boldly advertise this as
an Australian act. The leader of the saxo-
phone six is Sam Babecci, who, with other
Australians to help him, amply demonstrates
that imported bands can be excelled.
* *
Jack Mulhall shows himself to be an actor
of art in “Smile, Brother, Smile,” which
opens with a clever touch of originality—a
scene showing the triumphal progress of
an immaculately - dressed super - salesman
switches suddenly to a view of a shabby
Jack Mulhall reading a magazine advertise-
ment on salesmanship and visioning himself
as a success. There is humor, pathos and
intense humanity in this simple story of
everyday people which puts it miles ahead
of the average film. It is shown at Hoyt’s
(Sydney) with a Lon Chaney film, “The
Unknown,” which is artificial and forced.
"NOT TO-NIGHT, DEARIE!”
AT MELBOURNE PALACE.

Some contemptuous painters and a show:
At least some of the “Contemporary Painters”
whose canvases are exhibited at the Grosvenor Gal-
leries, George-street (Sydney), might more justly be
described as contemptuous as far as the ordinary
canons of art are concerned. George Lambert’s
“Tulips and Other Stimulants,” which includes a
flatly painted jug and, amongst a pile of fruit, some
rotten bananas intended to show how well Lambert
can paint rotten bananas, has been purchased by
the National Gallery trustees for 150 guineas; it
has the Lambert skill, but does not represent him
as well as some of the drawings which are his other
contribution. John D. Moore has a group of four
nicely composed water-colors; he scores best in
“The Dark Trees,” marked by a Blamire Young
influence, and “Dawes Point.” Thea Proctor, with
some nice grouping in a fan design, “Masquerade,”
also provides very likeable work. The rest is
mostly artistic chaos with the exception of a mod-
erately successful “Summer Heat” by Vida Lahey,
some paintings a trifle too much like geological
diagrams by Kenneth Macqueen, and an effective
study of a girl by Aletta Lewis. Among other offer-
ings by the last-named is “Judgment,” a curious
group of wooden figures—ltobots possibly—doing
nothing very badly; also there is a picture of a
woman, with a near leg withered, sitting in a
purple shadow that might pass for moonlight if the
canvas had not been tabbed “Afternoon.” In
“Stormy Weather, Austinmer,” Adelaide Perry shows
a demented sea that has piled itself higher in some
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT THE PLAY-
BOX THEATRE, SYDNEY.

finale of “The Awakening of Spring,”

Director) as the blind fiddler in “The
Marriage.”
places than in others. Margaret Preston con-
tributes a futuristic effort that looks like washing-
up left to dry, although what the unattractive apples
(or onions) are doing amongst the dishes needs
explanation. In “Distinguished Visitors’’ Roi de
Mestre paints a view of how Farm Cove might have
looked at the time of the Yorks’ arrival to a man
in a condition to see pink snakes and purple lizards;
and Grace Cossingham-Smith leaves the beholder to
guess why she names confused streaks of paint
“Trees in Blossom” and “Autumn Trees.” Her
masterpiece is a “Crook Neck Squash Flower” which
can actually be recognised as a bloom of the pump-
kin tribe.
The very comprehensive exhibition of 'the etch-
ings and aquatints of Henri Van Raalte, shown at
the Hordern Galleries, is a remarkable contrast in
its artistic exactitude and spacious outlook. Copies
of the best-known of the artist’s work, now in
various galleries, are included; for “The Road
through Karri” (of which there is only one print
available) 100 guineas is wanted. But there are
many very fine studies at extremely reasonable
prices, including a delicate display of roses in color
print and such delightful items as “Perth,” in which
the whole detail of the city in the distance is
crisply and effectively suggested, “Summer Light on
the Hills” and “A Creek in Flood,” with its won-
derful suggestion of water hidden in the grass. In
the larger work the artist revels in depicting
gnarled forest giants; one is shown with striking
effect in “The Gust,” a vigorous sketch of a wind-
swept woodland.
“Our Wife” (Melb. Royal) is a farce-
comedy belonging to the variety in which
there is a wife who is longing for champagne
and caviare when all she gets is shredded
wheat and spinach; an elderly husband who
pecks at her on his way to office instead
of bruising her with kisses; a, lover who
burns to free the lady from her chains but
finds her too naked for his taste when she
is without them; and an assortment of
cynical single women who favor easy divorce
because it puts husbands into circulation.
This sort of play is immensely popular;
writer forgets just how many he has seen of
them this year. As the. husband has to woo
his wife back into the path of virtue, there
are endless opportunities for scenes super-
ficially indelicate but actually quite proper.
In “Our Wife,” the husband takes his law-
ful spouse to one of those private cafe dining-
rooms with bedroom off which popular fancy
exclusively confines to Paris. Here the
audience obtains much innocent amusement
from observing the misapprehensions of the
waiters.
* $ *
“Our Wife” was the entertaining excuse
for introducing Margaret Lawrence to Mel-
bourne, as well as re-presenting Louis Ben-
nison. Miss Margaret is Irene Vanbrugh in
terms of vaudeville. The active little lady
is as full of amusing and tricks
as a threepenny pedlar’s tray in Colhns-
street. As the woman who finds marriage
all very well for invalids she made an admir-
able foil for Bsnnison, as large, gradual and
generally effective as ever. The able Wallis
Clark was his gentleman friend and Barrie
Livesey was a thoroughly sound lover. There
was much French language spoken, and much
difference of opinion as to the pronunciation.
* * * *
The Little Art Co. fanned “The Fires of
St. John” into some sort of flame at the
Queen’s Hall, Melbourne, on Friday. Nance
O’Neil presented the Sudemiann drama 25
years ago and was soundly trounced by the
critics for doing so. The public or the
critics are more hardened now. In the
present production the women once again
showed their vast superiority. Alice Best,
Beatrice Touzeau and she of the cameo face,
Lucy Alion, did get some heat into “The
Fires.” Their male supporters mainly burnt
their fingers. To-night the company will
pitch its tent at St. Peter’s Hall, where
Galsworthy’s “Joy” will be gone into.
* * * *
There is one tiling that is unique about
“The Student Prince” at His Majesty’s, Mel-
bourne, as far as the present commentator
knows. It is the first musicomedy in history
to have an unhappy ending. Yet it is doing
wonderful business and thereby shattering
Axiom 1 of the producers’ creed, that no
play will last a week unless it runs into roses
and confetti. But it would have puzzled
the most ingenious producer to provide “The
Student Prince” with a happy ending. As
the play is at present, lie marries a princess
whom he does not love, and Ivathie, the
waitress, is left displaying every symptom
of passionate despair Beppie de Vries can
supply her with. In real life she would pro-
bably be invited to grace a separate estab-
lishment at Court and would think herseif
lucky to get the offer. But an ending like
that would clash even more horribly with
the brocade and lavender charm of “The
Student Prince” than does the present spec-
tacle of Kathie’s abandonment.
At Melbourne King’s “Caroline” has been
dying for a fortnight past of too much fine
weather and the fact that there is a limit
to the number of people who want to see
Irene Vanbrugh in a febele comedy; so
“The Letter” will be torn open with pistol
shots on Saturday. “The Ghost Train” is
rumbling once more at the Athenaeum, but
how Madge Mclntosh, the principal staff
change, is delivering the melodramatic lines
of Julia Price will have to be described
in a later issue. America’s greatest dance
revue is in abundance at the Tivoli, but
isn’t so very different from the last one,
which was also the greatest. Business being
bad on all sides, the Princess is preparing
its Christmas pudding behind a closed and
shuttered front. The comestible, it is whis-
pered, will be a bonzer. “Private Izzy
Murphy” is capturing a wife and the admira-
tion of his regiment twice daily on the
Majestic’s screen, while at Hoyt’s John
Bowers is chasing the usual crowd of des-
peradoes through “The Heart of the Yukon”
and Lon Chaney is the star of “The Un-
known.”
Melbourne art: —
In a cosmopolitan array. of etchings, lithos and
other work in the line of convention at the Sedon
Gallery, the best bits of realism come from the
late Anders Zorn and the Australian Streeton. In
the romance department Lionel Lindsay and Gruner
may be set beside the Englishman Walcot with his
dreams of Oriental palaces. The N. S. Welshmen
Gallop and Friedensen also hold their own with the
importations. In the figure section N. Lindsay’s
portly ladies, all obviously designed to be mothers,
blow to ribbons the amemic prettiness of Punch
artist Lewis Baumer’s girls. W. J. Hosking, a Vic-
torian draughtsman, makes his debut with some elves
and fairies in the Ida Rentoul manner, but rather
better drawn. There is also much work by dead
craftsmen. Considering the way prices rise after
an artist’s death, it is a wonder a murder club
was not formed by art dealers long ago to dispose
of painters who cling too obstinately to life.
❖ *
At Adelaide Theatre Royal Carter the
Great saws a lady in half and puts the bits
together again without inconveniencing his
subject in the slightest, and Evelyn Maxwell
reads thoughts more easily than many a
shorthand reporter deciphers his own notes.
Pat Hanna’s Diggers are having a good
season at the Garden Theatre. Pretty
Louise Meadows is an old Adelaide favorite,
and there are some clever local gags in the
star turn, the duet by the sailor marionettes,
“Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Sheen.” Also Jock
Thompson’s fine baritone scores in the open
air. At the Majestic Theatre Robert
Robert’s Bon Bon Co. is still featuring
vaudeville. West’s Pictures are screening
“Is Zat So?”—the adventures in society of
a prize-fighter and his manager, previously
seen as a comedy at the Theatre Royal.
“Blighty,” the supporting film, is a British
war story.

shaving
For a heavy beard in par-
ticular this new home shave
is helpful. First build a big
rich lather with Williams-
Shaving Cream. Williams
lather saturates each hair
with moisture after lifting
the beard’s water-resisting
oil film. The beard then
offers little resistance to your
razor. The soothing elfed:
of Williams lather leaves the
face amazingly comfortable.
The Consummation of a
Perfect Shave.
After the shave apply a few
drops of Aqua Velva, the
new scientific preparation for
after shaving—Aqua Velva
conserves the skin’s natural
moisture—keeps it all day just
as velvety smooth as it is left
by Williams lather.
This new method takes no
more time than the old, yet
the result in lasting face
comfort is remarkable.

JOHN ADAM KEIL,
Secretary.
Poverty
Point
“I. Phelps”: Two of John Fuller’s New
York captures, George M. Cohan’s “Baby
Cyclone” and “The Merry Malones,” pro-
mise quick profits on a modest outlay. But
Ziegfeld’s “Rio Rita” will require a well-
picked cast and a strong.support of legs.
Eight chorus girls spread out to look like
80 won’t do. Perhaps Fullers hope to re-
sell the Australian rights.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: “Oh. Richard! How
Could You?” at Sydney Palace brought Zara
Clinton back to the stage. She was leading
lady in a Canadian co., but married and
settled in Australia. The stage called again,
and the Firm, wanting some people in a
hurry for the Palace venture, found her
name on its lists. She managed a lively
part and a French accent admirably.
“Ilamfat”: The .late Dick Stanford was
one of the founders of the Melbourne Green-
room Club, and the club has provided a
tombstone for his grave in Adelaide —he died
there whilst playing with the William Ander-
son show. Stanford produced drama for
Meynell and Gunn, and that was perhaps
his best metropolitan engagement, but he
was a capable actor. I will always remem-
ber his Wilfred Denver in “The Silver
King.”
“L.H.P.” : Grace Warner’s real name was
Lickfold (B. 24/ll/’27). I remember her
well as leading lady to her father, Charles
Warner, in a tour of Maoriland in 1889,
when she played Ophelia, Dora, Gervaise
(“Drink”) and the leads in “Captain Swift”
and “Hands Across the Sea.” Dick Stewart,
now “in front” at the Sydney Criterion, was
juvenile lead, and others in the show were
Connie Deorwyn, Jimmy West and Oily
Deering. In Australia Grace played smail
roles with her father under the Firm’s aus-
pices; Warner’s tour of Maoriland was his
own venture.
“Cauboy”: Count Filippini’s Italo-Aus-
tralian grand opera company vacated Melb.
Princess so suddenly that some people
thought that the place had burst into flames
inside. Various reasons were given to explain
why the enterprise took nearly £3000 out of
Perth and left most of it behind in Melbourne,
but the real trouble was that the prices were
too high for the quality of the entertainment
provided. The singing was good, and that sec-
tion of the public which has a musical ear
showed its appreciation by packing the lower-
priced seats. But the choruses and the
staging were only as elaborate as the Count’s
slender resources would allow. The people
who pay the big prices aren’t usually music-
lovers. What they love is an expensive-
looking show and finding their names
amongst the list of “those present,” just after
Lord and Lady Toddy’s.
“Dalba” : “Dusty” Booth, once of the Min-
ing Corps, conducts a one-man jazz band at
Moss Vale (N.S.W.). He works the pianola
by electricity, beats the big-drum with his
feet, and uses about 15 other instruments —
tenor and soprano saxophqnes, flexotone,
temple-bells, tambourine, wooden blocks and
whistles among them. Booth was badly
knocked at Ypres, but the welter of noise
keeps him cheerful.
“Craiser”: Investigation of a crowd in
front of the Firm’s office door at His
Majesty’s, Melb., disclosed James Liddy, the
male star of “The Student Prince” in all
his warpaint enjoying a cigarette between
the acts and not exactly hating the adora-
tion of the herd. The unconventional
American apparently doesn’t know that this
form of publicity isn’t favored in Australian
theatres. Even vaudeville contracts insist,
or used to insist, on artists removing their
make-up immediately after their turn and
WHEN NATURE IMPROVES ON ART.
“Funny old note thee blawed last, boay. Which wan was it?”
“That black wan, Thomas?”
“That edden a note, William 'Enry — tha’s a fly.”
“Can’t ’elp it; I blawed un.”
avoiding the front of the theatre oh their
homeward way. The managements are right.
You may wed a star in the imagination
when you see him across the footlights, but
see him by daylight with his make-up on
and you could only be a sister to him.
“I. Phelps”: Dion Boucicault believes
himself to be the only living representative
of a family that is mentioned by 81iak-
speare. He claims Lord Bouciqualt, named
in “Henry the Fifth” among the prisoners
taken at Agincourt, as an ancestor, and
has gone to the trouble of looking up parti-
culars in a book, “Les Heures de Marechal
Bourcicaut,” in the Bibliotli&que Nationale,
Paris. This Bourcicaut is declared to be
identical with the Bouciqualt aforesaid.
The Cardinal Bourchier in Shakspeare’s
“Richard III.,” by the by, was claimed by
the late Arthur Bourchier —Boucicault’s
brother-in-law and father of Prudence Van-
brugh—as one of the roots of the family-
tree.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Hoyt’s, in which J. C.
Williamson, Ltd., is greatly interested, has
put its foot in London. A big show-house
is being built opposite Victoria Station with
the idea of making it the London end of an
Empire chain. There was never a Hoyt in
the picture busness. Hoyt’s Hotel (the
Tivoli now stands on the site), where many
of the coaches from the diggings in the boom
days used to finish, was a well-known spot,
and the management of an early picture-
house in Melbourne seized upon the name.
Hoyt’s Theatre stands immediately opposite
the site of the old pub.
“Lever de Rideau”: When in Peking
recently, Benno Moiseiwitsch, who will play
in Australia again next year, was invited by
Feng Keng-kwang, Governor of the Bank of
China, and Mei Lan-fang, the famous Celes-
tial impersonator of feminine roles, to
supper at the banker’s sumptuous home. In
the midst of the festivities bandits raided
the place. The police arrived, and in the
fight which ensued large numbers of the
guests were wounded and one was killed.
A busy night ended when one of the bandits
was beheaded on the marble doorstep. But
Benno wasn’t there, having refused the invi-
tation owing to a previous engagement. His
press-agent must have found it hard to for-
give him.
“Tuart” : In one issue of a Sydney paper
last week two pitcher-theatres were adver-
tised for sale. This suggests a slump in
pitchers, and if the slump becomes general,
as I hope, the small dramatic cos. prevalent
25 and 30 years ago may revive on a vast
scale. There would be opportunities then
for Australian playwrights. I once had
hopes of an Australian film industry, but the
reports of the interminable Royal Commis-
sion have convinced me that this is out of
the question—for the next 10 years at any
rate. It has been abundantly shown that,
while Holywood makes the pitchers, the
press-agent and exhibiting side of the busi-
ness is controlled by ex-ushers, ex-publicans
and the like who, though Australians by the
accident of birth, are more American than
the Americans themselves. I am tired of
reading the assertions of these gentry that
we Australian guys inhabit a country with-
out a history or romance—that we can’t
write, can’t act, are poor physical specimens
and are inferior in every way to the godlike
Yank. If the bottom falls out of their “indus-
try” it will be only what the “industry”
deserves.
“Hamfat”: Sydney’s next new theatre will
be the one Frank Neil is to build facing
Central Square, unless an outcry against the
occupation of this area squelches the plan.
In its general construction and running
it will be on the lines _of the near-by
Empire. Four other sites in Sydney
have been considered recently as locations
for new houses, one of them being
in Pitt-street, facing the commencement of
the railway-station road ramp. The William-
son Co. is not likely to go ahead with a
new playhouse until the Criterion disap-
pears ; but there is a chance that I ullers
will finish off the roof theatre over the St.
James. Managements now realise that the
old style of show-house with its uncomfort-
able seats and faded fittings must go, but
they see no reason to interfere with prices—
as yet.
“Wood’s Green”: J. L. Sacks, a London
manager, is expressing his contempt for the
swelled heads of musical-comedy young
women by engaging a girl recently in the
chorus to play lead in his new production,
“The Girl from Cook’s.” Her name is
Eva Sternroyd. Eva is to get £3O a week
and, if she makes good, a bonus as well.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: “Dorothy,” revived by
the Victorian Opera Co. at Melbourne Prin-
cess, is associated with much Australian
theatrical history. Its first production in
Melbourne was in August, 1887. John Brun-
ton painted the scenery; Frederic! —who died
six months later whilst playing Mephis-
topheles—was Harry Sharwood ; Leonora
Braliam was Dorothy and Billy Elton was
the Lurcher. Nellie Stewart, Clare Meri-
vale, May Pollard, Flo Young, Patti Rus-
sell and Strella Wilson have been various
Dorothys in revivals. Howard Vernon on
several occasions was a fine Squire Bantam,
and George Lauri, W. S. Percy and C. 11.
Workman, all dead, were Lurchers at dif-
ferent times.
“C.”: Harold Moran, of Melbourne, who
accompanied the Guy Bates Post Co. to
South Africa, fills a decent part in the Lon-
don production of an American crook play
“Crime.” Louis Kimball, who was with
Muriel Starr in Australia, has another good
role. The others are nearly all Americans.
“Hamfat”: “The Flag Lieutenant” film
got a lift when Lieut.-Commander Ken-
worthy, M.P., complained in the House of
Commons that the Mediterranean Fleet had
carried out manoeuvres at the cost of
thousands of pounds for film purposes. Ken-
worthy’s objection was that the picture was
propaganda for militarism. But the employ-
ment of the vessels gave occupation to an
idle fleet, the expenses of which would have
to be met in any case. The result justifies
the Admiralty in every way. The picture
gives the world a reminder that the British
Fleet is still in existence.
“L.H.P.”: The filming of Jules Verne's
“Michael Strogoff” recalls the stage version
presented by Alfred Dumpier at the old Syd-
ney Gaiety in 1882. Dumpier played the
title-role, and W. G. Carey was the Czar.
Harry Emmett made a lot of fun out of
Dr. Julian, a war correspondent, said at the
time to be a skit on Julian Thomas, the
Australian journalist.
“,C.8.” : Dame Nellie Melba has altered
her plans: instead of going to Europe she
will remain in her Italian Garden at Lily-
dale to enable her to make her final farewell
appearance in Australia next March. The
date of her final farewell appearance for
1929 is not yet announced.
“II.K.”: London supports an even
smaller theatre than Duncan Macdougall’s
Playbox in Rowe-street, Sydney. It is inset
in the wall of a flat belonging to H. E.
Norris, the well-known authority on period
furniture and dresses. Constructed upon the
scale of half an inch to the foot, this dimin-
utive playhouse is so well wired that the
lighting effects compel the admiration of
every electrician who has seen them.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: “Rose Marie” is to be
turned into the country districts to harvest
further profits. While the main show goes
on to Maoriland a No. 2 co. is to do “the
provinces.” Bertha Riccardo gets an oppor-
tunity in the name-part. Harriett Bennett
had four understudies without giving any
one a chance to step into her shoes suffici-
ently long to tie the laces.
“Peter Pan” : Connie Ediss, of wTiom little
has been heard since the publicity of her
monkey-gland operation two years ago, is
being starred in London. The advertisements
for Wyndham’s Theatre announces “Connie
Ediss in ‘The One-eyed Herring.’ ” No
other name is mentioned. Connie’s nearest
approach to the heights was when she
appeared with Cyril Maude in. “Lord
Richard in the Pantry.”
“J. Phelps”: Harry Green is not dis-
heartened at London’s refusal to in him
the legitimate successor to David Warfield.
He announces further activities, among
them the first appearance in England of him-
self in “Izzy”, a new play by George Broad-
hurst, author of “Bought and Paid For”.
Also Cosmo Hamilton is letting Green
disport himself in a new work bearing the
familiar title of “Caste.”
STYLE.
[For The Bulletin.]
“ ‘There are styles in music like styles in clothes.
To be up-to-date in music one must be stylish,’
says the leader of a Yankee orchestra that has just
arrived in Melbourne.”
Ye troubled ghosts of olden melody,
We may not wait upon your stately leisure,
Though robes of rich harmonic majesty
By master hands may drape each seemly
measure.
Back to the casual chests of memory,
Your fabrics for the moths, your gems
corroded!
O foolish ones, are ye too blind to see
Once gracious vestments are to-day out-
moded?
For I like some style all the while for this
chile.
(Ain’t she nice?)
Whiz zip ! Let her rip !
Baby, sway that dippy hip.
(Look her over once or twice.)
Gee, pipe the drum ;
lie’s a bum ! He’s a bum !
Yes, sir; no, sir, that’s the way they come
When wc dress up Miss Music in the blues ;
She’s stylish from her shingle to her shoes.
Ye fretting shades, in gowns of rhythmic
grace,
Wrought in the wonder-world of the rare
dreaming
Of some unblinded seer brought face to face
With naked beauty; so he clothed her,
seeming
To weave a cloak of sound nor time nor place
Could e’er again forget; yet, unforgotten,
Such garments lack of modishness all trace,
Their style, alas, is—-absolutely rotten.
For I like to pile on the style all the while.
(Yes, sir; that’s my baby!)
For pep I gotta rep.,
Hot mamma, just watch y’r step !
(Ain’t y’ slippin’, honey?—Maybe!)
Gosh, I’m gonnaway;
If I stay—well, I may. . ..
Yes, sir ; no, sir, what I wanna say
Is —well, you’ll see yourself, unless you’re
drunk,
That prim old-fashioned stuff was just the
bunk!

MISS
MADGE ELLIOTT,
a beautiful Rexona
Girl, writes: “Rexona
Soap is worth its
weight in gold for the
skin and hair.”
ĥĥ
_ IHe a &>
Rexona Girl.
** it" me&m
health and beaw!
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their beautiful skin and hair. To be a Rexona Girl
is to use only Rexona Soap and enjoy that natural beauty of the skin and hair which cannot
be imitated, but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps

Song of the Gutters.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL day it rained, and it rained with a
strange and a sullen persistence;
Now in the evening rain drowns the
flickering lights of the city;
The wind is a sword atid the thunder an
ominous threat in the distance;
Night has been ravished of peace and the
storm mocks her prayers for pity.
Houses are sodden in front, but within them
are laughter and singing,
Food, and soft music, and fires gleaming
red through the chinks in the
shutters;
Down in the desolate streets where the rain
on our faces is stinging
Louder and louder we hear in the darkness
the song of the gutters.
Silent the flutes and the whispering violins
now are forgotten;
Like a great wave rolling down, or an
organ-played overture swelling,
Up from the pools of the outermost suburbs
where it was begotten,
Into the streets of the town, with the
night its wild music is welling.-'
Think not the song to be fit for the ears of
fastidious ladies.
Little of love is there in it, no sentiment
scented or mellow ;
More the lament of a Lucifer banished to
Heaven from Hades
Or the anguish of trees when the last
leaf of autumn is withered and yellow.
Those who laughed often and long in the
days that were strangers to sorrow
Hear in the song of the gutters no delicate
trill of the linnet,
But all the defeat of to-day and the sickness
of hope for to-morrow,
And all the remembrance of yesterdays
vanished for ever is in it.
Not like the magical voices of spring, when
in olden-time fashion
Pan blows his pipes in the hills where the
maids with their young lovers tarry—
The gutters know love as the voice of the
Magdalen bartering passion,
And half of the song that they sing is the
song of the burdens they carry.
Never a ship put to sea with a freight that
was stranger for lading,
Streams never floated such spoil as the
gutters take down in full measure;
So the song tells the story of all, till the
fires in the houses are fading.
To ashes, and tramping the pavement we
wait the sun’s dubious pleasure.
And only the gutters and we of the darkness
have seen what is hidden
From eyes of the world before dawn in the
concreted underground caverns,
The sewers, where outcasts have crept more
than once for a sleep terror-ridden —
Crypts where are hidden the secrets of
slums and the scandal of taverns!
Hear the flood swirl as it gathers a bundle
of rags and a letter,
Hear the song’s volume dissolve in the
tones of an old melancholy....
Columbine’s dress in the gutter in tatters
and, not to regret her,
Harlequin, married, discarding the traces
of Columbine’s folly.
There riding bravely to doom where the
gutter leaps over a railing,
Derelict now in the night where at noon
they were swimming so steady,
Frail little boats that the children on wet
afternoons set a-sailing
Drift with the flood as we drift on life’s
torrent or sink in the eddy.
Many a sleeper starts up ; many dreams of
delight have been broken ;
Many above the song’s sobbing have heard
like a ponderous hammer
Their heart’s beating; women have kissed
and wept over some sanctified token ;
Ghosts of dead sins, haunted shadows
refund pillows where pallid lips stam-
mer.
Shout on the roofs, bitter wind, tear the
trees like a furious giant!
Loose your flood waters, O clouds, till the
doors and the window-panes shiver!
The song of the gutters drowns ever the
sound of your challenge defiant,
Rolls on through the tumult of storm with
the strength of a drought-maddened
river.
Now sinks the song to a dirge for the last
hour of darkness is dying,
Over wet valleys of asphalt the bells to
their brothers are calling;
Still through the lanes and the alleys the
sorrowful echoes are crying;
Thunder still peals in the distance and....
still the rain’s falling and falling!
N.S.'W.
MERVYN O’HARA.
A Change of Policy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN first you took up the little grey-
homestead you counted on growing
wheat and barley and maize, and
leaving milk alone. Grain-growing was more
dignified and manlier than strumming on
Strawberry’s teats while she chewed her cud
and beat time with her tail. And being a
bachelor —what all young homesteaders with
any real respect for women ought to be—
you’d have time to cook yourself good meals,
and attend to your laundry occasionally.
And you’d be able to go for a ride to some
of the places on Sunday afternoons —-perhaps
on holidays as well, if you heard about them
in time. Instead of slaving morning, noon
and night, you’d make a white man’s job
of farming and show a lot of them how to
he their own bosses and masters of their own
fate.
So, contrary to local wisdom and tradition,
you start off and plough and harrow and
sow, and then pray and wait for the seed
to come up and grow, and, when it grows,
for it to escape blight and all other afflic-
tions that old hands warn you crops are
heir to if you don’t look out. And, after a
couple of seasons of ploughing and sowing
and the rest, you find you haven’t “looked
out” hard enough or something, and then
you meditate a lot at night instead of. sleep-
ing, till you lose flesh and look as if you
had been put through a clothes-wringer; and
you move and mope about like a shell with
the life gone from it. When you’re out
of kerosene and candles at the same time,
and have to meditate and smoke in the dark,
it will come home to you what a great part
a little illumination plays in the comforts of
a homestead, even one like yours; almost as
great a part as a little hanging plays in the
discomforts of a man’s life. But it all helps
to get you into the habit of going to bed
early and beating the birds in the morning,
and makes you well versed in the secrets of
homesteading, and teaches you how hard it
is to stand on your own feet, and that as
far as society is concerned you are fairly in
the wilds.
At last, when the old hands, who paid
dearer for their knowledge than you, keep
on shaking their whiskers and warning you
not to leave Strawberry out, and telling you
that ten or twelve of her, which would be
enough for one man to manage, would mean
as many pounds a month regular in your
pocket, and at the same time, if you couldn’t
shake off the habit, you could still keep on
ploughing and sowing, you decide on a
change of policy, and chance the ducks.
So out of meditating and smoking in the
dark, one day comes a close conversation
with the storekeeper. You’ve conversed
closely with him before, and found him sym-
pathetic and white all over. You’ve sold
him the remnant of a crop you harvested and
he’s got a contra account against you. It’s
been against you for eight or ten months and
growing faster than the corn did. But he’s
not reminding you of the account —he’s
listening to your conversion to Strawberry,
to the fresh hopes you see in her for success,
but more especially to the difficulty you see
in squaring his bill and buying a few of
her from the proceeds of the crop at the
same time. And when he says, “That’s all
right, Dickie, don’t worry; I’ll pay you in
full for the corn and you can buy the cows
and repay me monthly from your milk
money,” your heart will weigh light again,
and you’ll canter all the way home with
your hat hanging to the back of your neck,
whistling and feeling like Napoleon hurrying
from St. Helena to. mobilise a new army.
All that night cows bulging with milk will
trail through your brain, tramping all over
you, poking you out of bed with their horns
—herds of them there’ll be. Next day in
clean shirt and pants you’ll get across your
saddle-horse and ride into Terence Riley’s
farmyard at milking-time with a hand fumb-
ling in your pocket, and running your eye
over any of his herd that are lying about,
like a butcher looking for fats.
“Hello, Dickie, me bhoy,” Terence himself,
from under the flank of young Rosie, will
greet you as your head shows over the yard-
rails. “An’ where is it ye’re off to?”
“Looking for a few head o’ cows,” you’ll
tell him, dismounting—“if I can pick ’em
up cheap enough.”
“Well, you’ve come to the right place,”
Terence will say, winking at the boy in the
next bail. “No one ever got anything else
but cheap cows an’ th’ besht bred from
Riley’s.”
And while he empties his bucket and calls
to someone to fetch Polly and Kittie an’
Gooseberry into the yard, you move
amongst the soft-eyed creatures regarding
them critically and covetously.
“Money wouldn’t buy her,” Terence,, joining
you, will observe as you stroke the back of
a satin-skinned, companionable little beast.
“She’s pure bred, be the imported Govern-
ment bull, and has been givin’ her five gal-
lons for the last twelve months an’ more.
But there’s Biddie, standin’ in th’ corner
there just as good, if not better, that I’ll sell
cheap to you. An’ ’tis only because the
farm’s carrying more than it should that I
would sell her, or any of them at all. ’Tis
like parting with me heart’s blood.”
Then you’ll examine Biddie, and a host
of others that Terence will lead you to,
studying them hard. And while you’re study-
ing them and he’s fondling them, and re-
citing pedigrees, a conviction that you don’t
know so much about dairy-cows as you
thought you did will grow on you. So far as
you can judge they’re all good milkers and
super-animals. But as to how much milk any
of them are capable of giving and the quality
of it you’ve nothing but Riley’s word to
guide you. You know enough, however, not
to delude yourself that he’s going to dis-
pose of six of the best if he can unload six
of the worst on to you. So after chopping
and changing you decide to take a half-dozen
—“beautiful animals, the like of ’em can’t
be got anywhere else in th’ distric’” —and
because Riley “never likes to see anyone
go away feelin’ dissatisfaction,” you’re get-
ting them “cheaper than anyone else would
get them.” Then off you go, the pride of
ownership filling you with fresh hopes as
you flick those milkers along the lane to
your little homestead. You’ll be a much
prouder man in twelve months’ time, though,
when a dairy expert visits the homestead and
teaches you something about testing and
grading, and you learn, what Riley himself
didn’t know, that you bought for a fiver a
head cows worth a tenner and more!
You’re a man of the milking-yard now,
and you talk cow and think cow. You’re
a shareholder in the local Co-operative
Dairying Co., too, and every morning when
you deliver your couple of cans and see
them weighed you walk through with hands
in your pockets inspecting the plant and
appurtenances, and wondering if the hands
are earning their screws and if the cheese-
maker couldn’t perform the duties of secre-
tary as well and save the shareholders a
hundred or two a year.
The spirit of the employer will get into
your blood, too, and you’ll think about
engaging a man—one who knows how to
handle and work horses, and can milk with
both hands, and doesn’t mind roughing it a
bit until you get further on your feet.
“You’ll have a ’ard job to get one,” the
old hands will tell you. “It’s not work, it’s

waitin’ on that men want now- —until they
get a few quid together, and then away they
go.” But someone tells you that Macpherson
found one at the township for a quid a week
—a pretty good man he was, only he got sick
and had to go away to the hospital. So one
day you go oft' in your new second-hand
spring-cart to the township specially to hunt
for a man.
“There was a chap here only a little while
ago,” the publican will tell you, “and he was
askin’ about a job, too. lie might be just
the cove to suit you. Hold on till I see
if lie’s about.”
And while you hold on, looking up at
the bottles, and packets of cigarettes and
dice on the shelves and sniffing the odor of
stale beer rising out of a cask in a corner,
he goes out and yells like a bullock-puncher
(he was one, in fact, before going into busi-
ness) to all who can hear to tell that rQd-
whiskered cove lie’s wanted in the bar, and
to look lively. Then, returning, he’ll take
a murky cloth and start wiping some glasses.
And lie’ll be forecasting the weather for you
when the red-wliiskered cove—who also lias
red eyes and a red nose and a red handker-
chief —appears, hesitating and staring as if
he suspected it might be April Fool’s Day or
some other catch.
“You were wanting a job, weren’t you,
Whiskers?” the publican will question, and
so great will be the other’s relief on finding
it isn’t April Fool’s Day, or that you aren’t
a policeman, that for the moment he can’t
remember if he wants a job or not.
“Well, this chap wants a man for his farm.
There’s a chance for you.” And the publican
will pass him round the counter into your
presence and take up the murky cloth again.
You’ll ask Whiskers what sort of a hand
he is amongst horses? If he can plough?
And has he ever done any milking?
“ITorses? Plough? Mill,-?” Whiskers seems
surprised at you asking such questions.
“And what about wages?”
Whiskers will leave that to you. Rut you
would rather he stated a figure himself.
You’re afraid of slipping by mentioning some-
thing bigger than he expects. Whiskers has
no idea, not having been long in the district.
“A quid f” you question, timorously.
Whiskers, undecided, turns his red eyes on
the nublican in search of guidance.
“That’s the usual thing,” Boniface will lie
promptly, more in his own interests than
yours, as he places three glasses on the
counter. “And you’re darn lucky to get it.
Now. what’s it going to be?”
Whiskers calls for a rum. Not being a
drhiking man you shake your head.
“Have a ginger-ale—that won’t hurt you,”
the publican will advise, filling his own from
a bottle of tea. You change your mind and
agree to a ginger-beer. The publican lifts
lhs and wishes you both the best of luck.
Whiskers puts his down first; then, telling
you lie is going to get his swag and will meet
yon outside, he vanishes.
You’ll reckon he ought to suit you and will
be turning to the door to go off, when Bung
will out -with : “That’ll be eighteen pence !”
As well as being surprised you’ll get a
scare, because money is the last thing you
carry, about with you. You want all your
pockets for carrying washers, and nuts, and
nails, and twine and stuff that comes in
handy. But you remember that by a piece of
good luck there’s a florin somewhere about
you that you’ve been hawking round for
months, and you start searching for it. And
when you discover it among some binder-
twine you toss it on to the counter as if you
were darn pleased to get rid of it. In your
hurry to be off before Bung in his generous
way calls for another round of drinks, you
forget your change.
Arrived at the homestead, yjou tell Whiskers
lie can make his quarters in the house along
with yourself. Though you’re his employer,
you don't want to draw a social line or look
down on him. And you apologise to him
for the untidy state lie’s found the place in.
But Whiskers won't mind—he's been accom-
modated in places a lot worse. So long as
there are no fleas he doesn’t care. Fleas
keep him awake when he ought to be asleep.
And Whiskers will be a man who requires a
lot of sleep.
And while you're putting the kettle on and
buzzing round preparing a bit of dinner
before starting him on the plough, Whiskers
will unfold his swag and be making a bed
for himself in a corner, on the floor. He
won’t have any sheets or pillows, but he’ll
sort out his hairbrush and comb and clay-
pipes and tobacco and matches; and there’ll
be a bottle which he’ll keep covered and
handle gently as if it were a baby and lie its
mother putting it to bed.
When you both have dined—Whiskers bet-
ter than you—you’ll be scurrying round again
returning the butter and bread and beef to
their different places in the kitchen, and
stacking up the dirty dishes, putting off the
evil hour of washing-up till night, and at the,
same time communicating to Whiskers all
that it will mean to you if you can, with his
help, get thirty acres of wheat under in time
for the rain, and some new land broken up
before Christmas. And while you’re scurry-
ing and enthusing Whiskers will be standing
in the doorway smoking and agreeing with
you, and stepping aside whenever you want
to go out or come in.
Putting on your hat and closing the door,
you’ll take him out and introduce him to the
plough-team. You’ll harness them up in his
presence, showing him certain marks by
which to identify their respective collars and
winkers —the backhands won’t matter so
much. Whiskers won’t be listening, but lie'll
be stroking the horses’ foreheads and filling
their eyes with smoke, and grinning.
“Now then,” and you take hold of the
reins eagerly and start off, driving the team
to the paddock. Whiskers will follow, cover-
ing you and keeping in step like a soldier.
When you “Waay!” the team at the barb-
wire gate, he’ll “Waay.” too, and stand while
you drop the reins and open it. You’ll hook
them to the plough while he knocks the
ashes from his pipe; and taking the handles
you’ll go a round or two, giving him hints
and calling his attention to little things to
keep in view; and nil the time he’ll be stalk-
ing behind you, studying the footprints you’re
leaving in the moist furrrtw and looking ba n k
at intervals to see if you’re doing straight
w T ork.
“There you are,” you’ll gasp at the finish;
“now go ahead"—and you’ll hand the plough
over to him. He’ll tighten his hat and dawdle
a while, hoping you'll depart to your own
job without waiting to watch how he starts
liis. He would sooner you returned in an
hour’s time, after he’s had some practice.
But you’ll be anxious to see how he shapes.
So you'll speak to the horses for him, and
off they go. You’ll stand watching, expecting
to see an exhibition of ploughing—-something
unusual. And you see it. The plough will start
wriggling and jumping, and Whiskers will
wriggle and jump with it. And what the
mould-board fails to turn over he'll be trying
to kick over. He’ll soon be trying to kick
it all over. You’ll feel as if you had lost
heavily at the races; then, trying to cheer
yourself by remembering that everything is
new to Whiskers, and thinking he might do
better after a while, you’ll go off to the milk-
ing-yard to fix up another bail.
You’re putting finishing touches to the
bail now, trying to see how it works ; hum-
ming tunes to yourself, and thinking about
bringing the cows in, when loud profanity is
wirelessed across the gully to you in waves.
Looking through the yard-rails you see the
plough-horses facing one another across the
plough and, rearing and shaking their heads
and falling back on their rumps; and Whis-
kers will be running round, first to the tail
of one, then to the tail of another. Love me,
how you leave the yard and run to the
rescue, ripping your pants and your flesh in
falling through the barb-wire fence without
being aware of it!
“Pshaw!” and Whiskers will spit when
you’ve pacified the team and collected the
broken harness. “This is no good to me!
Those horses ought to be running with
brumbies.”
But you won’t feel offended. You’ll know
that men sometimes make a smoke-screen
of their tempers to hide incompetency; so
you do your best to smile.
Later, in the milking-yard, when Whiskers
struggles through with one cow while you’re
polishing off the other five, you’ll try to
smile again and tell him that you know it’s
always hard for a man to strike form at
first. But Whiskers, on whom bad humor
will seem to be settled for good, will
tell you it’s not his (unprintable) game,
“Stockriding is what I’ve been at —-dashing
through the mulga on a good horse —throw-
in’ scrubbers head over tip and tying them
down—not messin’ round with blanky
plough-horses and cows.”
After supper, though, when you’ve washed
up and Whiskers is lounging on his bed
stealing swigs from the bottle whenever you
go out to the kitchen, he’ll be in better
humor, and you’ll like his company. He'll
relate weird accounts of his experiences out
west ’midst thirst and privation and death.
And while he’s relating them to you the
wind-haunted trees outside will be swaying
and sobbing, and the dog, in fear of lurking,
dingoes, Will be whimpering at the door.
“Did ever you read any of the po’try a
cove called Boake used to write?” he’ll ask.
You haven’t, of course, but you’ve heard
some of Henry Lawson.
“Not him. This cove Boake was a stock-
man on the- Thompson when I was out there.
He was a drover an’ a ’orseman. And you,
livin’ in a hole like this, never heard ‘NYhere
the Dead Men Lie’? Well, I’ll give it to
y\”
And when, to the accompaniment of the
moaning trees and the scratching of tne
dog at the door, Whiskers, his big eyes
fixed on you like red mantles burning in the
dim light, drools-
“ Out where the wild dogs chorus nightly,
Out where the grinning skulls bleach whitely,
tJnder the saltbush sparkling brightly—
That’s where the dead men lie!”
you’ll think ghosts, and fancy the hand of
one is feeling for your hair. And just as he
concludes and the dog suddenly shoves the
door open and the wind gushes in, you'll let
out “Hell!” and give a jump. So will
Whiskers.
Next morning, instead of rushing off when
you shake him a number of times and call
him to round up the cows. Whiskers will
mope round in homesick fashion. And when
you tell him cheerfully that you can see
all the horses on the ridge-side, he’ll shake
his head and say: “Oh blime nte* boss, I
think I’ll chuck it in,”
Of course you’re not sol'ry; you’ll be
pleased, but you don’t want to show yOuf
pleasure, so you’ll tell him that it aii tests
with himself.
“Full pay for yesterday, then, an’ we’ll
be quits?”
You won’t object to that, even though
he put in only half a day, and a darn bad
half!
“And yhu’ll fnn me in in the cart after
breakfast?”
That’ll make yoit bite your lip, but you’ll
say “Orright!” and, cursing him under youf
breath, you'll go off for the covvs,
But next day, when you discover that
Whiskers had your fancy stockwhip, and
your razor and snake-skin belt in his swag
while yon were driving him in and hoping
he’d come and see you again sometime, you’ll
curse him fervently and far above your
breath 1

Slow dies the song.
Slowly the iovesong dies,
The rosy glow

No weeping know,

Best in Peace
and War
SUPERSTITION dies hard. The Boer War
gave birth to the idea that misfortune
attended the third person to light his cigarette
from a single match. Soldiers found that,
although reasonably safe for two cigarettes to
be lit, to attempt thi e lights usually meant that
the sniper had time to range sight and send a
bullet on its way.
Thus the match was important in war as it is
in the days of peace, when its manufacture pro-
vides work and wages for more
than a thousand Australians.
