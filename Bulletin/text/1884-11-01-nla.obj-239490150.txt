The Duke and the Printer.
The printing press is the grandest averager
of the age. By the mighty alchemy of the
criticism which follows publication, false
pretensions to superiority of intellect, and
the spurious deferences which high rank
tains from its ordinary surrounding of syco-
phantic adulators, are resolved into their
elements. A Monarch may patronise or may
disgrace a Shakespeare; a Duke may blast
a Henry George, socially, by a frown or a
sneer. But when the Monarch condescends,
or the Duke ventures, to waive the fictitious
and accidental advantages of rank, and
enter into competition with Shakespeare
or with George in fair rivalry in the Re-
public ot Letters, it is quickly seen which is
the abler, and perhaps which is the nobler,
man. All our readers are now in some de-
gree acquainted with Henry George, the
popularizer of the economic theory that, by
nationalisation of land, the frightful ills of
the existing Social system may be entirely
remedied. And some, at least, of our readers
will be aware of the existence of the Duke
of Argyll. Although this is true, probably*
of readers of The Bulletin merely be-
cause they are for the most part Britons,
it is quite likely that millions in differ-
ent countries of Europe and America, who
have heard the name of Henry George re-
verberating through the world, had never
known of the existence of Archibald,
Duke of Argyll, until that hapless (in a lite-
rary sense) nobleman ventured to take up
the argumentative cudgels on behalf of the
privileged and propertied owners against
this plebeian prophet whose voice was cry-
ing woe upon the monopolisers of God's
gifts, in a ton© which, like the sound of the
last trump, penetrated to all the ends of the
earth. Nevertheless, the Duke of Argyll is a
remarkable man—for a Lord. Among his
order he is distinctly the man of most philo-
sophic ability. Hi? contemplative mind has
impelled him to put his reflections upon re-
cord ; and he has published at least one book
which would have been read by a few people
interested in like subjects, even if he had not
been a Duke. “ The Roign of Law,” by the
Duke of Argyll, we have not even read. But
among its readers was a certain printer of
San Francisco—a man interested in kindred
speculations — one Henry George. This
man in turn wrote a book (“ Progress and
Poverty ”), and among the persons whom he
honoured by a presentation copy was the
author of “ The Reign of Law,” the Duke of
Argyll. The presentation was not, we be-
lieve, acknowledged at the time by any ex-
pression of thanks or otherwise. But when
George’s book had found its way ;into the
hands and the principles it taught had
penetrated to the very soul of multitudes of
people, the Duke, as one possessing much
land, was stirred. He, alarmed, read the
hook, found in it sentiments and proposi-
tions which, if generally accepted and
carried into practice, would so operate that
there would not, in the future, be many
more Dukes of Argyll possessing a great
*lice of Scotland, and controlling the for-
tunes of thousands of other men. And the
Duke—his preconceptions, his traditional
belief in his order, and his pride revolting at
every sentence he read—took up his pen,
and set himself magnificently to crush the
presumptious plebeian with the full weight
°f a literary distinction which His Grace had
Probably been accustomed to hear rated at
an equal value with his rank.
* * *
The Duke’s article is not a feeble or tri-
iu S performance. On the contrary, it is
ably constructed, and must have appeared
very powerful to any one who had not read
and comprehended the works cf which it
treats. The attack on George is dexterously
arranged and vigorously conducted. The
Duke shows himself no contemptible dis-
putant. Butin Henry George’s hands he
is as a Philistine warrior in the grasp of
Samson. The rejoinder of Henry George is
positively annihilating. It has evoked
throughout the world Homeric peals of
laughter at the expense of the over-
matched aristocrat whose vanity had in-
duced him to enter the lists against
an intellectual giant of the age. And
the two articles furnish, apart from
their argumentative value, a singular en-
lightenment. That is. that it is the noble
who is vulgar and the plebeian who is
polished. The Duke splashes about epithet
and abusive phrases. The printer scorns
such resource, Jand retaliates only with the
most penetrating, polished, and subtle satire.
His Grace entitles his paper “ The Prophet
of San Francisco,” a title which is a fneer.
And throughout his pages we find scattered
broadcast such broad allegations as that
Mr. George's system is on a par with that
of a demented gentleman who has written
treatises to prove the world is flat; that his
theory is, in the words of Voi/taibe, an
“impertinence abominable that he deals
in “fustian;” that “ there is no mere practice
of corruption which has ever been alleged
against the worst administrative body in
any country that can be compared in cor-
ruption with the desolating dishonour of
his teaching;” that he enunciates “immora 1
doctrinesthat he inculcates robbery; that
he is actuated by euvy and violence; that
“ he has steeled his moral sense against the
iniquity of even the most dishonourable
conclusionsthat he advocates colossal
villainy; that the world has never seen such
a Preacher of Unrighteousness as he; that
his logic is “childish,” and his conclusions
are “prolligate;” that he touches the lowest
depth ever reached by any political philo-
sophy; that his works are full of “ this kind
of stuff;” that his reasoning is of “ incredi-
ble absurdity;” thathis processes in matters
of reasoning are not more absurd than his
assumptions in matters of fact; that he
talks “arrant nonsense,” and must have in
his composition “a very large percentage of
the fanatic and the goose;” that he is not in
the least shocked by consequences which
abolish the decalogue, and deny the primary
obligations both of public and of private
honour.
♦ ♦ *
These are specimens of the aristocratic
method of argument. Evidently His Grace
is very angry. People who have been ac-
customed tc hear that all the graces and
elegancies pertain to the nobility as part of
their birthright, will iind it difficult to credit
us when we assert that jealous scrutiny has
detected in Mr. George’s rejoinder to the
Duke not one single answering vulgarism.
If the Duke shows that he is furious,
Mr George demonstrates that he is calm.
Perusing his reply, one would judge, in-
deed, that he is rather enjoying him-
self. He disdains personalities, and buf-
fets his antagonist with demonstrations
of principles. The bitterest thing he per*
mils himself is the withdrawal of a com*
pliment. When he sent the Duke the pre-
sentation copy of “ Progress and Poverty,”
he knew His Grace only as the author of
“ The Reign of Law.” He had then never
visited Scotland, nor learned the character
His Grace there bore as a landlord. He
intended to pay a tribute to the man of
letters, not to irritate the land-owner. He
had not thought that “ a trumpery title and
a patch of ground could fetter a mind which
had communed with Nature.” He admits
his mistake, and publicly apologises. Here,
however, George discards personal re-
joinders. He joins Issue with the Duke on
hia own ground, and accepts what His
Grace has termed ‘‘the Reduction to Ini-
quity.” Quoting a reflection by the Duke,
“ that the moral faculties do not as cer-
tainly revolt against iniquity as the reason-
ing faculties do against absurdity,” Georgs
proceeds straight to business. He denies the
accuracy of the maxim. He maintains on
the contrary, that “ wherever moral percep-
tions have differed, or do differ, the disturb*
anoe may be traced to causes which, origl*
nating in selfishness, and perpetuated by
intelleotul perversions, have distorted or
dulled the moral faculties.” Thus admit*
ting, even more fully than the Duke himself,
the competence of the tribunal to which the
latter invites him to submit his case, and
accepting ‘‘The Reduction to Iniquity,”
Geo roe states the indictment without
flinching. The Duke, he says, " charges me
with advocating violation of the moral law
in proposing robbery. I agree that robbery
is a violation of the moral law, and is there-
fore, without further inquiry, to be con*
demned.” Next he states, in terms which
do not admit of cavil, a definition of what
constitutes “robbery.” It is, he says, “the
taking or withholding from another of that
which rightfully belongs to him.”
* • *
We make no apology for having omitted
up to this point to epitomize the conten-
tions of the Duke of Argyll’s paper. As a
matter of fact, the Duke himself admits t
with perfect accuracy, that he has not
attempted to argue.* He merely runs
over the results which to him appear to
follow from George's proposals, and com.
ments according to his lights. And us
George leaves no point unanswered, it
becomes most convenient to deal at the
same time with allegation and rejoinder.
At the conclusion of the preceding para-
graph we have given the basis of disputation.
Apparently Mr. George had quietly stepped
into the dock and placed himself upon his
trial as an instigator of robbery. But in his
very next sentence he steps out again, and
ere long he has, without apparent effort,
edged the Duke into the vacant place. The
whole dispute turns upon the expression
“that which rightfully belongs to him.”
George, at this stage, suddenly propounds a
distinction. He converts the trial from a
criminal accusation against himself into a
question of title. He thus discriminates—
“That which rightfully belongs to him, be It
observed, not that which legally belongs to him
As to what extent human law may create rlirhts is
beside this discussion, for what I propose Is to
change, not to violate, human law. Such change
the Duke declares would be unrighteous. He thus
appeals to that moral law which is before and
above all human laws, and by which all human
laws are to be fudged. Let me insist upon this
point. Landholders must elect to try their case
either by human law or by moral law. If they
say that land is rightfully property because made
so by human law, they cannot charge those who
would change that law with advocating robbery.
But if they charge that such change in human
law would be robbery, then they must show that
land is rightfully property irrespective of human
law.”
Land, he proceeds to argue, is not of that
species of things to which the presumption

of rightful property attaches. That only
attaches to such things as originate in human
exertion, and the right of property which
attaches to them springs from the manifest
natural right of every individual to himself
and to the benefit of his own exertions.
This is the moral basis of rightful property,
totally irrespective of human law. If there
Were but two men in the world, how could
ene of them claim the world as his rightful
property ? Or, if they agreed to divide the
world between them, what moral right could
their compact give them against the next
man who came into the world ? But the fish
which either of them took out of the sea,
the beast he captured, the fruit he gathered )
or the hut he erected would be his rightful
property, which the other could not take
from him withoutviolation of the moral law.
But Mr. George declines to fight with
shadows. As a matter of fact, no one—not
even the Duke of Argyll—has seriously as-
serted that property in land rests upon any
other derivation than human enactment.
And human enactment may be changed
without violation of moral law. The Duke
ventures, indeed, to hint indirectly at the
‘‘right” of appropriation—which is simply
the right of conquest, the right of the
strongest. George deals with this hypo-
thetically : If exclusive ownership has been
attainable by appropriation, it is still so
attainable; ergo, if the masses of Scotland,
who have the power, choose to seize the
estates the Duke now holds, he cannot, if
such be the basis of his claim, consistently
complain—which is rather a heavy argu-
mentative back-fall for the noble Duke.
But scorning an illicit advantage, Mr.
George declines the victory. He expressly
denies that appropriation can confer right
to exclusive ownership of the soil. The his-
torical inquiry, moreover, he regards as ines-
sential. Precedent cannot over-ride moral
law. The investigation, however, may be
interesting, and he does not deeline it. For
example, he says, the Duke says a good deal
about his own estates, “but has nowhere
told us how they came to be his estates.”
Here Mr. George gets in one of those neat
thrusts which we have spoken of. The in-
quiry, he admits, with rather satirical can-
dour, is a delicate one, and on that account
he will not press it; and he continues—
“ But while a man ought not to be taunted with
the sins of his ancestors, neither ought he to profit
by them. And the general fact is, that the ex-
clusive ownership of land has everywhere had its
beginnings in force and fraud, In selfish greed and
unscrupulous cunning. It originated, as all evil
institutions originate, in the bad passions of men,
not in thole perceptions of what is right or their
experience of what is wise. ‘Human laws,’ the
Duke tells us, are evolved out of human instincts,
and, in direct proportion as the accepted ideas on
which thej rest are really universal, in that same
proportion have they a claim to be regarded as
really natural and as the legitimate expression of
fundamental truths.’ If he would thus found on
the widespread' existence of exclusive property
in land 1 an argument for its righteousness, what,
may I ask him, will he say to the much stronger
argument that might thus be made for the righte-
ousness of polygamy or chattel slavery ? But it
is a fact, of which I need hardly more than remind
him, though less well-informed people may be
Ignorant of ft, that the treatment of land as in-
dividual property is comparatively recent, and by
at least nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every
thousand of those who have lived on this world
has never been dreamed of. It is only within the
last two centuries that it has, by the abolition of
feudal tenures and the suppression of tribal
customs, fully obtained among our own people.”
• • •
Dismissing this aspect of the subject, Mr.
George invites his antagonist to meet him
on higher ground, and proceeds to- desper-
ately wound the Ducal eagle with a shaft
feathered from his own wing. In “The Reign
of Law” the Duke explained with what nice
adaptation the feathers on a bird’s wing are
designed to give it powers of flight. (Judged
by this passage, His Grace’s book would
sesm to- owe agood deal to Palsy’s “Natural
Theology”). Well, if this be your line of
reasoning, says George, with what intent
have human creatures been given capabili-
ties of body and mind which, under condi-
tions such as exist in such countries as
Great Britain, only a few of them can use
and enjoy 1
“ The Duke sees Intent in Nature. So do I. That
which conforms to this intent is natural, wise, and
righteous. That which contravenes it is unnatural,
foolish, and iniquitous. In this we agree. Let us
then bring to this test the institution which I
arraign and he defends. Place, stripped of clothes,
a landowner’s baby among a dozen workhouse
babies, and who that you can call in can tell the
one from the others? Is the human law which de-
clares the one born to the possession of a hundred
thousand acres of land, while the others have no
right to a single square inch, conformable to the
Intent of Nature or not? Is it judged by this
appeal, natural or unnatural, wise or foolish,
righteous or iniquitous? Put the bodies of a duke
and a peasant on a dissecting table, and bring, if
you can, the surgeon who, by laying bare the
brain, or examining the viscera, can tell which is
duke and which is peasant. Are not both land
animals of the same kind, with like organs and like
needs? Is it not evidently the Intent of Nature
that both shall live on land and use land, in the
same way, and to the same degree ? Is there not,
therefore, a violation of the intent of Nature in
human laws which give to one more land than he
can possibly use, and deny any land to the other?
Let me ask the Duke to consider, from the point
of view of an observer of Nature, a landless man
—a being fitted in all his parts and powers for the
Use of land, compelled by ail his needs to the use
Qf land, and yet denied all right to land. Is be
not as unn il i;ral as a bird without air, a fish with-
out water ? A nd can anything more clearly violate
the intent of Nature than the human laws which
produces ,oj momalies?
• • •
Then, pr< ceding to the argument of long
possession . < nferringindefeasabieand right-
ful title to monopoly of land, the repeti-
tion of a w ong may dull the moral sense
(another subtle thrustat the “ Reduction to
Iniquity” pj oposed by Argyll) but will not
make it ri; hi. A robbery is no less a robbery
the thousand-millionth time it is committed
than it was the first time; and monopoly
of land is a robbery perpetually repeated.
It involves a continuous confiscation of.
labour and the results of labour.
“ The Duke of Argyll has, we say, a large income
drawnf .* >m land. But is this income really drawn
from lan 1 ? Were there no men on his land, what
income cvuld the Duke get from it, save such as
his own Lends produced? Precisely as if drawn
from sla v re, this Income represents an appropri-
ation ol the earnings of labour. The effect of
permitting the Duke to treat this land as his pro-
perty la to make so many other Scotsmen, in
whole m in part, his serfs—to compel them to
labour or Dim without pay. or to enable him to
take frc*n them their earnings without return.
Surely,I f tne Duke will look at the matter in this
way, ho must see that the iniquity is not in
abolishing an institution which permits one man
to plunder others, but in continuing it. He must
see that any claim of landholders to compensation
is not a claim to payment for what they have
previously taken, but to payment for what they
might yet iake, precisely as would be the claim of
the elavehf Ider—the true character of which ap-
pears in the fact that he would demand more
compensation for a strong slave, out of whom he
mighi get much work, than for a decrepit one,
out of whom he had already forced nearly all the
labour he could yield.”
Up to this point, the philosopher has almost
played with the titled dilletante; now he
become* terrible. With a power of delinea-
tion which has in it something awful, he
holds up to the Duke of Argyll, as In a
mirror, his own country, and illuminates it
by the light of that “Reduction to Iniquity”
which the unhappy wretch had himself pro-
vided. “ Test the institution which you call
sacred,” he cries; “ test this holy institution
of private property in land by its fruits ” in
Scotland.
“ What, there, are its results ? That wild beasts
have supplanted human beings; that glens which
once sent forth their thousand fighting men are
now tenanted by a couple of gamekeepers; that
there is destitution and degradation that would
shame savages; that little girls are stunted and
starved for want of proper nourishment; that wo-
men are compelled to do the work of animals; that
young girls who ought to be fitting themselves for
wifehood and motherhood are held to monotonous
toll in factories, while others, whose fate Is sadder
still, prowl the streets; that while a few Scotsmen
have castles and palaces, more than a third of Scot-
tish families live In one room each, and more than
two thirds in not more than two rooms each; that
thousands of acres are kept as playgrounds for
strangers, while the masses have not enough of
their native soli to grow a flower, are shut out
even from moor and mountain, dare not take a
trout from a loch or a salmon from a stream I
i ... With the same thoughtful attention he
has given to ‘the way of an eagle in the air,’let
the Duke consider a sight be must have seen many
a time—a Scottish woman tolling uphill with a
load of manure on her back. Then let him apply
‘the reduction to iniquity.’ .... Orlothlmgo
to Edinburgh, the ‘modern Athens,’ of which Scots-
men speak with pride, and in buildings from whose
roofs a bowman might strike the spires of twenty
churches he will find human beings living as he
would not keep his meanest dog. Let him toll up the
stairs of one of those monstrous buildings, let him
enter one of those ‘ dark houses,’ let him close the
door, and in the blackness, think what life must
be in such a place. Then let him try the reduction
to iniquity. And if he -go to that good charity
(butalasl how futile is Charity without Justicel)
where little children are kept while their mothers
are at work, and children are fed who would other-
wise go hungry, he may see infants whose limbs
are shrunken from want of nourishment. Per.
haps they may tell him, as they told me, of that
little girl, barefooted, ragged, and hungry, who,
when they gave her bread, raised her eyes and
clasped her hands, and thanked our Father in Hea-
ven for his bounty to her. They who told me that
never dreamed, I think, of its terrible meaning. But
I ask the Duke of Argyll, did that little child,
thankful for that poor dole, get what our Father
provided for her? is He so niggard ? If not, what
is it, who Is It, that stand’s between such children
and our Father’s bounty ? If it be an institution,
is it nor our duty to God and to our neighbour to
rest not Dll we destroy It? If it be a man, were It
not bettor for him that a millstone were hanged
about h'L neck and he were cast into the depths of
thesea?”
♦ * *
It is useless here interposing words of our
own, when the Master himself speaks to
such purpose. We continue, therefore, to
quote; -
As illustrating the usefulness of landlords,
the Duke says:—
‘My own experience now extends over the best
part of forty years. During that time I have
built over fl fty homesteads, complete for man and
beast, i have drained and reclaimed many
hundred? and Inclosed some thousands of acres
In this sense I have added house to house, and
field to field, not—as pulpit orators have assumed
in similar- oases—that I might dwell alone in the
land, but mat the cultivating class may live more
comfortably and with better appliances for in-
creasing the produce of the soil.’
And ag£iu he says that during the last four
years ho'fcas spent on one property £40,000
in thei morovement of the soil-
“Whar, I would like to ask the Duke is,
(George continues) how he built the fifty
homeste.i l a and reclaimed the thousands of
acres. Not with his own hands, of course,
but with his money. Where, then, did he
get that money ? Was it not taken as rent from
the cultivators of the soil ? And might not they,
had it been left to them, have devoted It to the
building of homesteads and the improvement of
the soil as well as he ? Suppose the Duke spends
on such improvements all he draws in rent, minus
what it costs him to live, is not the cost of his
living so much waste as far as the improvement of
the land is concerned ? Would there not be a con-
siderably greater fund to devote to this purpose
if the Duke got no rent, and had to work for a
living? ’
* ♦ *
We need add nothing to these extracts. Their
overwhelming force, and the lurid light they
throw upon the shameful scene, transcends
anything our weak art can produce. A
little further on, Mr. George utters the
apothegm that “the plea of the landlords
that they, as landlords, assist in production,
is very much like the plea of the slave-
holders that they gave a living to the slave.”
One curious circumstance connected with
the two articles upon which we have drawn
for this digest should be stated, as illustrat-
ing the difficulty with which any Social
reformation has to struggle. A very large
proportion of the Scotch newspapers noticed,
we are assured by a correspondent at home*
the Duke’s essay. Most journals gave lengthy
extracts; many reprinted the entire paper.
But not one leading journal in Scotland so
much as mentioned Mr. George’s crushing
rejoinder. It is a mistake to believe that
the power of the Press is essentially and in-
variably in favour of progress. In the
coming struggle between the plundered
many and the plundering few, the great
journals will be ranged, without exception,
against the poor. For great journals have
become great properties. Their proprietors
have made, or seek to make, their way
among the magnates of the earth. If a
prosperous paper support the cause of the
oppressed in the future, the fact will be due
to some eccentricity on the part of its con-
ductors—some devotion to principle, without
reference to the personal results. But, as a
rule, people will have to look to “rags” for
advocacy.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Trifle.
In commenting upon the proposal of the Anglican
Bishops, that the general religious teaching pro-
vided for by the 7th clause of the Public Instruc-
tion Act be extended and amplified so as to become
practically a sedulous inculcation of dogmatic
theology, the S. M. Herald, besides objecting
that Roman Catholic teachers would refuse to
be made the instruments of what would, were the
Anglican Bishops satisfied, be Protestant propa.
gandism, argues that nobody could complain of
the Churches going so far as to have the general
religious teaching as embodied in the Scripture
lessons fully taught. This is merely an assertion.
Everyone who dissents from the doctrines em-
bodied in the Scripture lessons could com-
plain, with justice, of their, children being
indoctrinated with teachings which they be-
lieve to be not merely untrue, but in-
jurious to the reasoning faculties of the young.
But probably no one, except extremists, will object.
The number of parents who consider that cram-
ming with such legends as Jonah and the Whale,
and so forth, is detrimental to the cultivation of
the power of discernment and ratiocination, is un-
doubtedly very great. But the more sensible and
philosophic among those parents will probably be
satisfied that, while it is very difficult to twist a
child’s mind to really believe absurdities, it is hap-
pily extremely easy, with all the influence of
natural sense and plain probabilities working
against such teachings, to neutralize their effects
and make them instrumental in conveying to the
young j ust ideas of what is and what is not absurd.
Ten minutes’ table-talk in the home circle, or mere
contact with every-day conversation, will amply
suffice to undo all the mischief attempted to bo
wrought by the recital of legendary romances, by
teachers who for the most part will be at little
pains to disguise their own scepticism regarding
what they are obliged to teach. The world will
continue to revolve around the sun despite the
ex-cathedra declarations of the priestly caste and
its lay helots.
The “Boozer’s” Paradise.
The Swiss nation drink more alcohol per head than
any other European people. In 1881-1883 the im-
portation of wine (although the country is wine-
pro -lucing) reached the large figure of 803,969 quin-
tals, a quintal being one hundred gallons. In
thirty years the importation has quadrupled,
although during the same period there has been
little or no increase in the population. In addition
to the wine, there is Imported every year ten mil-
lions of litres of pure alcohol, for the purpose of
being manufactured into what is termed eau-de-
vie. Brandy of “ best quality ” is purchasable at
6d. per litre, and it is sold everywhere, and in almost
every class of shop. In England, one has to pay
an average of sixpence for the sixteenth of a pint
of alcohol; a full half-pint can be bought in Swit-
zerland for one penny. In a corresponding ratio
with the increase of drinking, mental diseases and
indigency have increased, until the mad-houses are
full to overflowing; and the poverty “amongst
the lower classes ” is frightful. We suppose that
among the “lower classes” the members of the
Council, or Lower Chamber (corresponding to our
Legislative Assembly), are not included. This
estimable body have had before them for years
and years the horrors of the drink system; but
they rather appear to favour it—one reason being
that the grog traffic annually yields 150,000,000

ing a chapter devoted to the “Advantages ot the
Drink Trafflo.” Here is a bit of It:—
“ It is doubtless possible to discuss and talk
without drinking, or confining oneself to tea or
coffee: but everyone knows by experience that
after a hard day’s work, when one feels over-
whelmed by professional cares, it is impossib e to
bring a cheerful temper into the society where
we amuse or mutually encourage eich other un-
less one indulges in a glass ot generous wine, or
refreshing bear, which effaces the traces of daily
labour, and opens the heart to other impressions.
Can anyone deny the nec sslty of these re unions
for the development of our public life in general?
Can any one deny that in many localities and for
many people the relations of sociability are inti-
mately associated with the life of the public-
house? Can any one deny that the numerous
societies, formed either for recreation and amuse-
ment, or for the nurposo of discussing measures
which concern subjects of general interest - that
the extension of popular rights and the develop-
ment of the Press-are not each and all so many
reasons tor increasing the frequenting of houses
of public resort? It we deplore the excess of
drinking, which is often the consequence; if we
blame those who spend uselessly their time and
money in gossiping, in talking public-house
politics, and in card-playing, we cannot disguise
from ourselves, on the otner nand, the stimulating
influences of these reunions on the intellectual
activity of many, nor the good fruits th .y often
bring to the public interest*. As much as we
sympathise with those whom the craving for drink
has thrown into the arms of madness or has led to
suicidb or crime, we must not forget that in the
public-house is to bs foun i a social life tuat is an
effloacious remedy against hypochondria and
misanthropy, as well as against egotism, vanity,
narrowness of ideas, and extravagance of imagi-
nation.”
The foregoing is a chunk of the collective wisdom
0 f Swi'zerland. We can imagine a man writing
such a “ Blue Book ” while under the influence of
“James Hennessy & Co., Cognac,” and we aro
quite aware that many “ hypochondi iacs and mv-
Sinthropists ” do regard soda and alleged brandy
as a panacea for all evils; but we have never known
an “egotist" who became more modest as the
bowl went round, that modesty alone excepted
which induces a man, towards the end of a long
flight, to find repose beneath the table, after the
manner of our festive ancestors, —nor did we
ever know a man's “ vanity ” to decrease in
direct ratio to the number of times he looked
upon the wine when it was red. We have known
tfrog to act as a palliative lor “ narrowness of
ideas,” but, on the other hand, we are prepared to
aver that alcoholic stimulants can only be relied
on to check “extravagance of imagination”
through the medium of the lock-up and police-
court. As to the “ development of the Press '*
being a reason for frequenting public-houses, we
firmly refuse to express any opinion whatever.
We can only say that the Swiss Federal Council
Rre the greatest humourists (and probably the
greatest “boozers ”) who ever lived. No wonder
they expelled the Salvation Army. Their “Mes-
•age”—think of Buchanan, Taylor, M’Blhone,
khd all the rest of them sending up such a Blue-
fiook to Dalley and Sir John Hay !-almost in-
Plres one to sing, with Giraldus Cambrensis:—
“If I must die, let me die drinking at an inn,
Hold the wine-cup to my lips sparkling from the
bin;
Then while angels flutter down to take me from
my sin—
0 Lord, have m?rcy on this sot; the cherubs will
begin.”
Mrs Maguire’s Tobacco-Pouch.
At Liverpool, “ a very stylish lady, named Ma-
guire,” on lauding from an American steamer,
was asked the usual question whether she had in
her possession contraband goods. Her reply in
the negative did not satisfy the Customs offleor,
who suspiciously eyed her peculiar walk and ap-
pearance, and iminted upon her accompanying
him to the p jlice station. There she was searched,
and it was found that her “ improver ” was so ar-
ranged as to hold six pounds of smuggled tobacco.
The account does not state whether Mrs. Ma-
guire’s best Virginia aromatic was “ cut-up,” and
therefore soft, or inthe form of plug, which would
have been rather hard to sit on. It will cause the
sex considerable inconvenience at present if the
mere fact of a lady being “ of peculiar walk and
appearance” be held to justify a rude Customs
man in marching her off to the police station, and
search'ng her tobacco-pouch. Let us, in the in-
terests of gallantry, venture to hope that English
manners are not to be judged by English customs.
This Liverpool story reminds us of one we read
long ago in a French paper. At Pans, an ap-
parently very fat man one day waddled through
the octroi gate. The douanier was quite familiar
with his face, hut that face had surely, when last
he saw it, never boon associated with such a mon-
strous figure. So the fat man was stopped and
searched. It was found that he had, to evade pay-
ing duty, rigged up and tied round his waist a false
stomach of india-rubber, which contained several
gallons of brandy. Perhaps that’s where Mrs.
Maguire got her idea. By and bye, we shall, no
doubt, have ladies and gentlemen going out for
harbour picnics—the lady carrying the tobacco
d la Mrs. Maguire, and the gentleman escorting
the beer after the fashion of the fat gentleman of
Paris. It is now quite a common complaint that
men are too fond of brandy and tobacco to care
about marrying. Lovely woman has now the
means of holding out an irresistible bait. Let her
always be well trimmed, fore and aft, with cognac
and cavendish. But never let her, in her inno-
cence, try to sit on cigars.
Viva! Humbert.
When the other day, during: the prevalence of the
cholera epidemic In Naples, KingHuMBERT of Italy,
quitting the comparative safety of his palace at
Home, proceeded to the afflicted city, and there
visited the hospitals, cheered the sufferers, and
freely exposed himself to all the perils of infection,
the press resounded with adulation. Wo did not
ass ; st to swell the chorus. Our idea is that King
Humbert was no more entitled to credit than the
man who, finding your purse, hands it to you
instead of puttijg it into his pocket. In other
words, we hold that Humbert was simply dis-
charging an obvious duty. In cholera epidemics
more people are Infected by the predisposition
Induced by scare than because they are physically
susceptible of the malady. In such circumstances,
what is wanted is a prominent illustration of the
fact that infection does not necessarily and as a
matter of course follow exposure. And who
so fit to furnish the example as the people’s
King ? In modern days the monarchical character
has strangely dwindled and shrunk. The two Em-
perors who have of late years “ led ’ their armies
to war, have “ led ” them in every Instance from
the rear. If, by any unforseen shift of front,
either Pious Billy or the late sainted Czar found
themselves within the range of artillery Are, the
heroic calmness and decent deliberation with
which they removed to a place of safety was
trumpeted iu every Gazette. But lead a battalion
into rctlon, as our own Prince Henry flung him-
self at the head of his men-at-arms into lue breach
at Harfleur, they never did. The most magnificent
piece of mountebankery during the Kusso-
Turkish war was when the Czar Alexander,
posting himself on an eminence just out of reach
of all but spent cannon-shot, personally honoured
the soldiers who were ordered to take the Gra-
vitzka redoubts at Plevca by looking on
while they marched into the hell of Are,
and lead, and Iron, and permitted themselves
to be killed, and torn, and mangled, and
left In t rment to be mutilated by the victorious
foe—while their living and heroiciSovereign, on the
failure of the assault, majestically led the retreat’
and cantered off with unrumpled plumage to the
nearest sale refuge, where his French cooks and
serving-men had the entries and champagne frappi
in proper order for His Majesty's supper. Our
own Prince Leopold— the first of his blood, since
George of Cambridge found Inkermann surfeit
his stomach for combat, to take the Held against
an enemy—was carefully posted in the reserve, and
never came under tire at all. Undoubtedly, the
exploit of Humbert was heroic for a modern
King. What we object to is that it should be ne-
cessary to make such an admission. If it be not
the kingly duty to lay down his life for his people,
whose is it ? The heroism of a mere ordinary
mortal should be the ordinary deportment of a
monarch. But now the case is reversed; and what
is mere ordinary discharge of duty in a physician
or hospital nurse, is extraordinary heroism in a
modern King. Viva, Humbert! true King! But,
to the devil with the servile scribes and sycophants
who grovel in voluntary abasement, and who are
so unwittingly satirical as to go into raptures of
astonishment whenever a monarch does not fail to
be equal to the duties of his station.
An extraordinary development of the pretensions
of legal practitioners is reported to have occurred
in Melbourne in connection with an application
by the wife of Mr. Delves Broughton, deputy-
master of the Victorian Mint, to have her husband
released from a lunatic asylum and transferred to
her charge. According to a published statement,
a Mr. Furlonge, a lawyer, opposed Mrs. Delves
Broughton s application, on the ground that
the costs in a former application had not been paid.
If this report bo accurate, it appears that the
lawyer wished the Judge to rule that no person
incarcerated as a lunatic in an asylum should be
entitled to obtain his release, even though he had
recovered his reason, so long as he owed money
to his lawyers. Mr. Justice Williams did not lend
a yielding attention to Mr. Forlonge’s objection,
but the fact that any lawyer should have had the
audacity to approach a Judge with such a propo-
sition discloses an extraordinary conception of the
privileges which the legal caste imagine their
brethren on the Bench might be not unwilling to
establish for their benefit. Had Mr. Fohlonoe’s
objection been upheld, presuming that It was
really made, Mr. Delves Broughton would prac-
tically have been sentenced to detention in a
lunatic asylum for life, unless he could pay his
lawyer’s bill. We see no earthly reason why R
lawyer’s bill should stand on any different footing
from a grocer’s bill: and c:nceive the monstrosity
of a grocer appearing before a Judge to oppose the
liberation of a former customer from a lunatic
asylum, not because he was unfit to enjoy liberty,
but because he had paid no attention to “ account
rendered ”1
The position of the telephone in England
is now almost ideal. No royalty is charged on
business done by private companies; and subscri-
bers are able to dictate telegrams through the
telephone, just as those who use the Post-offlce
telephones may. Had the State insisted on its full
monopoly, the r'evelopment of telephones would
have been strangled.
At the Positivist service in memory of
Auguste Comte, Dr, Congreve commenced his
“prayer” thus:—“ We praiso thee, Humanity, as
for all thy servants, so especially for Auguste
Comte; and we pray that in proof of our gratltudd
we may become thy more willing and complete
servants.” The service concluded with the bene-
diction as follows:—“The peace of her slowly-
dawning kingdom bo upon you, the blessing of
Humanity abide with you, now and for ever.”
One good point about the Cabbage Garden
crowd 1 i that they seldom or never hide their light
under a bushel, but, on the contrary, they gener-
ally do their condomndest to make the world be-
lieve they hold an eighty-candle-burner lamp
whilst at the same time they can barely raise a
wooded match. A short time ago, the Victoria
Amateur Turf Club blazoned forth the fact that
they had magnanimously decided to give no less
than £2000 to be whacked between the first three
horses in the Caulfield Cup: and then this worthy
club voted Itself one of the most liberal in the
world, climbed up Into a high place and stood
ready to receive the homage of the racing public.
The plain fact, however, is that out of this £2000
no less than £1025 comes out of the pockets of the
racehorse owners themselves, and the self-compla-
cent club only subscribes a paltry £75—about aa
freat a sura as was raised for a plate, the other
ay, at the Bathurst Geranium meeting. The nomi-
nations for the Caulfield Cup this year numbered
135; the first deposit brought the club £675, the
second £365, the 73 horses who remained in added
an extra £465 for the third payment, and the 23
final acceptors then planked down £15 each, and
brought the total up to £1925. Having gazed at
that picture, take a squint at this. The modest
Sydney Turf Club gives £500 for the Anniversary
Handicap, and allows horses to remain in up to
within half-an-hour of the start without any
further call than the solitary sovereign put up for
the entrance. This year, Mr. Clibborn has secured
136 nominations for this race—by far the largest
yet received for any flutter in the colony-and the
8.T C., without any flourish of trumpets, have
generously supplemented this with £375—or three
cool centuries more than the V.A.T.C. put up for
their much-lauded prize at Caulfield. When you
talk of Victorian enterprise after this, remember
the story of the aquatic enthusiast who, having
presented a rowing club with a bung-hole, made
the world believe he had given a whole boat.

Brisbane people are complaining of the

telling a newspaper reporter there that Queens-

black calumny, and would, of Itself, be sufficient
to stamp them as unscrupulous renegades. But
they add to their unenviable report for unver-
acity by Conveying the imputation that there is a
good deal of latent poetic power in the native
Queenslander. When Harold and Charles come

In 18GG Paul de Cassagnac was insulted by
a young writer, who sought a duel. Cassagnac
agreed. A rendezvous was arranged, and when
Cassagnac arrived, behind him there appeared a
servant carrying a huge parcel. The young jour-
nalist was puzzled, and turned pale. When all
was ready for the fight, coats off, swords un-
sheathed, trousers turned up over the ankles,
Cassagnac turned round to hl« seconds and his
doctor, and inquired carelessly : “Doctor, you
have ordered the mattress for the corpse to be
laid in a convenient place ?” At this the opponent
dropped his sword. It was picked up and offered
to him, but he refused and at once made his apo-
logy. There was no duel.
John Field, charged with drunkenness
before the Southwark Stipendiary, in the course
of conversation with that functionary about gaols,
work-houses, and the treatment of the destitute,
remarked that things would be better and there
would be less beggars about, were the Prince of
Wales to look after the poor instead of hnrse-
racing—an observation that seems to us to scin-
tillate with point—but which led to the magisterial
admonition, “Don’t disgrace your country by
talking so foolishly.” If Field was still drunk
when arraigned, ’twas a case of in vino veritas.
As for the talking foolishly it was the beak who
did that; and as for disgracing the country, the
blame probably lies pretty equally ’twlxt the
vagabond, the beak and the Royal Highness.
On September 2, the Perfect of Police at

of his Excellency the Governor, General Gourko —
On the occasion of the visit of his Majesty the
Czar, who will arrive towards the end of August
(old style), the inhabitants of the town will
decorate their houses with flags, hangings, and
flowers, and will place busts and portraits of their
Majesties on their balconies and in their windows.
In the evening they will illuminate their houses
outside with gas and torches, and burn wax
candles Inside their windows. The principal
bands of Warsaw will play during the illumination
in such places as shall be designated by the police.”
This almost reads like a chapter from a description

Perrot, the Victorian pedagogue who got
into it one time about his beard, has now got Into
it about the Bible. His own acoount of it is very
clear. He maintains that a school-girl led him on
to explain why it was Eve was sent adrift out of
Eden, Although he demurred for a while, her
importunity at last prevailed, and he gave an
exposition based, as he alleges, on the Scriptures
solely. Now, Perrot’s right to his beard we have
always granted; and when the public showed a
disposition to question his right, wo exerted our-
selves in his favour. But Perrot’s right to inter-
pret the Bible in State schools we will not support
even by our silence. We deny his right. The man
is evidently greedy. He wants to swagger about
with both a beard and a Bible. He should be con-
tent with his beard.
Hutton, the Queensland hangman, is 84
years of age. But he still enjoys his profession,
and Is said to be as enthusiastic over a fresh sub-
ject as ever he was in his palmiest years. He
throws his whole soul Into his work. Where he
throws the soul of his subject is a matter of no
importance to him. It is a cheeringr thing, and
one that makes us think better of human nature,
to imagine this good old gentleman working away
contentedly, and even blithely, at his calling, un-
deterred by the Infirmities of age, and|undaunted
by the fear of meeting in the next world those
whom he sent so summarily out of this. It is a
lesson for all of us, dear readers. Whenever we
feel inclined to murmur at orr lot, or to become
discontented with the sphere of life assigned tons,
let us only remember the example of Hutton, the
venerable hangman, and peace will be restored to
our bosoms.
Had he not been a peer and a wealthy
man, Lord Houghton would probably have been a
great poet. Not being obliged to use his genius,
e has but half used It, and the author of
“ Strangers Yet ” is unknown to many even by
name. Yet, forty years ago, there were compe-
tent critics (so Kosmos says) who held Lord Hough-
ton to be Tennyson’s superior; and as gifted in
expressing Nature through poetry as Words-
worth himself. He has not fulfilled his promise of
early years. He has written exquisite occasional
compositions, has sent out several small volumes
of beautiful verse, and every line he has written
has been essentially such as would appeal to
cultured and refined minds. But, being born in I
the purple, he has stopped short of greatness, and
become Instead one of the pleasantest hosts, most
welcome guests, and agreeable companions in |
English society. Such Is Lord Houghton, the
author of the sweet, sad song of “ Strangers Yet.’
The Melbourne Shakespeare Society is in
hot water. One Brown wanted to sit on “Juliet ”
the other night, and Professor Norris threw out
his legs and wanted to sit on one Brown. One
Brown objected to that. The Professor, as Presi-
dent, intimated that one Brown was a fool, and
that it was an insult to “ Juliet ” to have such an
addle-head galivanting about her. This was in all
probability an earnest and profound truth. Bat
there seems to have been no use in hitting Brown
with earnest and profound truths. The leg of a
table or the heel of a slipper come nearer to what
he wanted. Brown insisted on his right as a
Briton, and especially as a Victorian, and still
more especially as a Brown, to carry on with
“Juliet” as long as he liked. The President got
him down, however, after a fierce struggle, and
squeezed him for the rest of the night. It is de-
scribed as a scene with “ one Brown. ’ Why not
describe it as a scene with two Browns ?

In a hall adjacent to tbe Randwick Asylum), “that

gratitude from this generation when she takes
Lewis to her loving bosom and carries him—silent
at last—around the sun In his little trench. W hen
this occurs, we will go out there on holidays »n“

IMPATIENCE; OR, THE BUN-BITER’S BETRAYAL.
Swaggering into the pastry-cook’s shop, where erstwhile he had
been snubbed, he boldly chucks an attendant houri under
the chin, hints at drives to Botany, and calls for a cup of
coffee, 16 bath buns, an “ Othello,” a “ Geneva,” six cream
cakes, a meat pie, two oyster pates, nine jam rolls, and a
chocolate drop.
r Mr. Hapworth finds it difficult to get himself attended to at pastry-cook shops
where females are in attendance, while at the same time he notes that buns and
blandishments arc heaped upon men of inferior mould.
He ascribes the cause to his somewhat ancient and unmasher-like appearance,
and resolves to try the effect of a little veneer. Adopting maaheriau habit,
he promenades the street, and is gratified to perceive that his altered ap-
pearance is not without Us effect upon the female mind.
“ 1 say, look here, what do you call this horrid stuff which
I found in ray coffee? ” said Mr. Hap worth, with great
indignation.
‘‘Please, sir (he-he*be !), I think it is your false mous-
tache,” said the attendant houri. Confusion ! Exit,
Hapworth.
And the worst of it is, a sort of second
cousin to the attendant houri,
waited upon Mr. Hapworth a few
days after, armed with a bull-dog,
and remonstrated with him, and sat
upon him, and punched his head,
and “ sooled” his dog upon hi m, and
otherwise despitefully u-ed him,all
along of his trying for to deceive a
poor defenceless female. Nomura
as usual!


State schools of Victoria. Mr. IngllsJ has proven
to his own satisfaction that the people never
wanted a purely secular system, and that the Go-
vernment that passed the Act had no intention of
administering: It as it has been administered. He
had some difficulty, evidently, in making these
two points clear to himself, and he confessed to
grave apprehensions as to his ability to make
them clear to the nation. He went and fetched a
man to help him. The Rev. Inglis had a brotherin
the House when the Act was only a Bill, and this
brother told him that the Government carried the
measure through, giving members to understand
that religion was still to be taught in the schools
That’s what the reverend historian told them
down in Ballarat 1-itely. He sajs it was the ad-
ministration of Wilberforce Stephens, the first
Minister under the Act, that played the secular
deuce with the country in general and with the
churches In particular. Thus history rehabilitates
an iniquitous Ministry.
A couple of the Maori chiefs wrote from
Naples to England (while on their way back to
N.Z.), to an English teetotal dignitary: “ We have
one Christ, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.
Queen Victoria and her Maorl-Bnglish subjects are
one. . . May Queen Victoria, and her people,
and her Ministers, and the nobility, and the bishops
and clergy live long. May God take care of us all.
From Hori Roplha andTopia Turoa.” What a pity
that the Maoris have been left to find political help
among the pious women and the Pharisees I What
a pity that they thould have no strong friend in
EngJand-that they should, Instead of having been
taken by the hand by a statesman with a big heart
and a square jaw, have been turned over to the
rapacious gospel-grinding hypocrites who have
aided in robbing them of their patrimony 1 What
a pity, we say, that such a man as the great
Ngatimaniopoto chief should be Judged by the
standard of the weak Tawhiao—that the mission-
aries should have been allowed to lead about in
England the unsophisticated delegates of the splen-
did Maori race like “converted” dancing-bears—
that nearly all that has appeared in the English
press about Tawhiao during his visit should have
been in the nature of ridicule or of cant, and have
pointed to the idea that the Maoris are, in manhood
and intelligence, not one whit higher than the
wretched drunken Australian blackfellow, whose
dying utterances are iabbered forth in the annual
catalogue of “ happy ” Christian aboriginal deaths
so cheerfully printed by the well-meaning, simple-
minded Matthews, of Maloga Mission Station I

We had better let the gifted tank-sinker that sup-
plies “ Facts and Scraps ” to the F. and P, Gazette
tell the tale So:—‘We (sic) were very much
pained on Sunday night last, at the C.E. side win-
dows to observe a young man successfully dis-
tractiog’ th© attGotion oi SGVGral young ladies from
so excellent a discourse as the lecture (sic) on our
Lords (Sic) Prayer, delivered bv Mr, Logan of the
Water Hole Station. This conduct is most repre-
hensible and should It come under my observation
again, I shall name the offenders ” (sic). We opine
that such an “ excellent discourse ” as “ Our Lord's
Prayer,” especially when “delivered by Mr. Logan
of the Water Hole Station,” would be quite suffi-
cient to impress the most hardened sinner with due
solemnity, but this frivolous young man was proof
against even the impassioned oratory of Mr. Logan
of Water Hole Station, and “successfully” mashed
" several young ladies.” On a further perusal of
the gleanings of this veracious and conscientious
chronicler, however, we are enabled to account
for the milk in the cocoa-nut. Hear him:—“We
are glad to note our C.E. clergyman is returning to

collect a good congregation at morning service.

nearly so old as the teetotal veteran, has, during

intellectual strain which devolved upon Mr.
Livesey. Despite the fact that Mr. Gladstone
drinks wine In moderation, he is capable of per-
forming feats which, whether regarded physically

Councillor Sheehan, an Italian jlntleman
from Cork, has for many years reigned as king of
Nagambie (Vic.); and, as his prefix indicates!* he
has been a prominent member of Ithe local sLire
Council. The peculiar talent required to fulfil the
onerous duties of a representative of the Victorian
ratepayer is largely developed among the Irish-
tocracy of that part of the country—wnich may bo
readily seen by a glance at the roll of councillors,
or, better still, by a visit to the council chambers,
where a clear and comprehensive map of Ireland
can be traced on the majority of the faces that
appear round the council-table. Bat the pompous

Not only in the matter of stature is the O'Sheehan 1
great, but in the way of intellect he is mighty 1
and, in that respect, he is somewhat like Artemus
Ward, who used to remark, “ Gentlemen. I have a
great and mighty Intellect, but I guess I didn’t
brlnar it with me this evening.” Tkere is an un-
written cod© of etiquette usually’observed amoor
( shire councillors which embodies some restrictions,
and these restrictions are hateful to the soul of
this eminent councillor. A country editor draws
a sad picture of this local law-maker—or, rather
a series of pictures which go to show that he is a
man of more than ordinary talents. He wears his
shiny silken beaver” in ostentatious defiance of
the President, and by doing so literally “ broke
up his fellow-councillors; during a spirited de-
bate on the respective merits of “ corduroy ” and
metal” as the best material for road-making, he
slept the sleep of the Just; and, besides, he has no
more respect for the president of that august
body than if he were a common member of Parlia-
ment or a C.M.G. At a recent meeting, this
modest councillor and the chairman got trading
off civilities over a section of road-work, when
the latter, after laying down the location in his
usual clear and concise style, was flatly contra-
dicted by the belligerent councillor. This is tne
kind of gentle dialogue that followedThe

It lias become the fashion of late years for
a certain class of persons, which even includes
such eminent people as Judges of tho Supreme
Court, to pour contempt upon journalists and
journalism. Mr. Frederic Harrison (who was
£°l°*t° i ec t ur e in Australia) put it as a question
ln p he hund , red million of papers scattered
daily o\er Europe there could be found at a given
moment any single article worth a letter of Vol-
taire or of Madame de Sevignd. Mr. Matthew
Arnold bettered this example by quietly assuring
the Americans that journalism had no place in
literature, and that journalists could lay no claim
to be considered men of letters. Now, in so far as
this serene contempt for tho ephemeral produc-
tions of the daily Press is a symptom of revolt
against the excessive presumption of newspaper
proprietors such as Mr. Al we mean Mr. Janies
Gordon Bennett of the New York Herald, a
gentleman who would judge Shakespeare himself
by his ability in reporting Police Court oases so as
to take well and give pleasure to all.” we regard
it with satisfaction. It is true that the journalist
does not seek to add anything to the sum of
human knowledge, but to disseminate widely
whet is already known. But on these very
grounds Mr. Matthew Arnold, whole a past-master
in the art of borrowing from others and selling as
his own, belongs to the confraternity of jour-
nalists. For Instance, In one of his most famous
nooks, in which he endeavours to show the in-
lluences exercised bv what ho calls Hebraism and
Hellenism, he has borrowed the idea of placinir
the Greek s desire to know in opposition to the
Hebrew s desire to act rightly, from Heine, in his
Keisebllder ; only what the German poet puts
in a sentence Mr. Arnold has thought fit to beat
out carefully over 500 pages. Not only has Mr.
Arnold borrowed the ideas of his books, but he
has also borrowed all the telling phrases he so

Old Carl Schwenzel, of Ruthorglen (Vie ),
has for many years supplied the thirsty diggers of
the Ovens district (Vic) witn the cup that cheers and
—occasionally Inebriates. Carl is the personifica-
tion of the good old Vaterlander, robust to a
degrbe. with the constitution of an elephant, and a
Voice like a fog-horn. His love for Vaterland is
°5*y equalled by his undying hatred for the land
of Gaul, and while he swears by Prlnhe Bismarck,
he swears at M. Ferry in rounded periods begotten
of long and arduous practice. On the morning of
the last anniversary of the capitulation of Sedan,
the citizens of the peaceful little village of ttuther-
glen were aroused from their normal listlessness
u *‘ ie booming of artillery, accompanied by the
sharp rattle of small arms, so they jumped out of
bed and rubbed their eyes, wondering what could
be the matter. The commander-in-chief of the
local defence “foorce” was filled with alarm,
when, rushing out ffom head-quarters In undress
uniform to reconnoitre, he beheld what he graphi-
cally described as a “furrlner'n flag” floating
Proudly and defiantly over old Carl Schwenzel’s
whisky-saloon In the main street, and the con-
tinued cannonading led him to the inevitable con-
clusion that the hamlet had been captured by an
Invading army. Hastily summoning bis troops, a
hurried consultaGon was held, and it was decided
to engage the enemy in the rear by a contingent
under Constable O’Gulfln, while “Sarglnt”
M Muzzle proceeded “ bouldly ” to the front.
Both movements were rapidly executed, and the
victoria Hotel was quickly invested by the local
gendarmerie, who discovered the old warrior, Carl,
grimy as a powder-monkey, covered with perspira-
tion and glory, strongly entrenched behind a for-
tification of Llmburger cheese, German sausages,
saur-kraut, Schiedam schnapps, and lager beer,
and howling out “ Die wacht am Rhine ” In what
the sarjint termed “a loud tone of voice.” He had
a „ r ude park of lartillery, consisting of a number
of blacksmiths’ anvils, which be loaded up to
the chin, so to speak, with explosives, and
tired them off with a report like an eighty-ton gun.
A truce was proclaimed and mutual explanations
followed, the popular excitement cooled down,
the lo ° al “foorces” were reluctantly withdrawn
after demolishing a portion of the barricade, and
Carl celebrated tne downfall of the last Napoleon
with a grand lager beer carnival. Old Schwenzel’s
Teutonic proclivities were very pronounced, and
his bar fairly bristled with pictures portraying the
prowess of the legions of Kaiser Wilhelm, while
the portraits of the Imperial family, along with
those of Bismarck, Von Moltke, and other vete-
rans of Vaterland, frowned from the walls on the
mulloch-punchars of Rutherglcn, We remember
on one occasion dropping in to sco old Carl, osten-
sibly to sample his lemonade (?—Kt», B.j; and

PALMER a id WILEY, 113 Pitt-street, Sydney.
This Company is being formed for the purpose
of working an extensive deposit of blue metai in
a block of ten acres of land one half-mile from toe
Rockwood Railway Station, on the road to the
Liveipool-road, leased by the Government to Mr.
Hewitt, of Burwood, at a rojalty of six-
pence for each ton of metal raised.
The metal is of a very superior description, and
is sought after by the Municipal Councils of the
western suburbs and by the Government to such
an extent that Mr. Hewitt finds it impossible, with
the pecuniary means at his command, to supply
the orders which he holds. He has already by a
large expenditure stripped the lode for a length of
some fifteen chains, and from any point in this
lode metal may be taken in quantity. The lode is
found to widen as it deepei a, and it cannot be esti-
mated to what extent Its depth and with expand;
but from the exposed part sufficient metal
can be taken to supply the surrounding munici-
palities for a long time to come.
From the manner of occurence it seems to be
one vast blow of metal, the result of convergence
of three distinct lodes, each coming from an east-
erly direction. _ .... .. .
With the limited means at Mr. Hewitt s disposal,
ho finds he can neither supply the necessary ma-
chinery, nor work his quarry on a scale requisite
to secure the large returns it is capable ot yielding.
Giving his opinion as an experienced quarryman,
he is convinced that a large amount of wealth is
to be obtained from proper development of his
quarry. And in this opinion he is supported by
that of other men as fully experienced as himself.
In respect to a market for the stone when raised,
it needs but to be stated that not only is Mr.
Hewitt at present unable to supply the orders
which he holds, but has had to decline some which
were offered. „ , ,
Of course, with a fair amount of capital at com-
mand, it would be possible, with the aid of suit-
able machinery and an enlarged system of word-
ing. to raise any quantity of metal which may bo
required, and with this object he has determined
to offer the property to the public—and he does so
with the utmost confidence in ite bona flJes—m
9000 shares of £1 each, 6000 of which will be avail-
able to the public. It is proposed that these shares
shall be contributed upon as follows:-3s. dd. on
application, 3s. 6d. on allotment, and Is per shaae
per month. The quarry is in good working order,
and, as the returns will be immediate, It is ex-
pected that not more than 10s. in each share will
need to be called up. . ...
Mr. Hewitt, for his interest in the quarry, will
retain 4000 fully paid up shares, and take £850 from
the subscribed capital as a partial return for the
large outlay he has incurred.
It is intended to apply the subscribed capital in
purchasing and erecting powerful machinery, such
as stone-breakers, winding plant, and other effi-
cient appliances to ensure a large and rapid output
and effect an immense saving in wage*.
No time will be lost in obtaining and erecting
the machinery as soon as the necessary capital Is
subscribed. The quarrv is now in active opera-
tion, all work b ing done by hand labour only.
it is calculated that from road-metal alone the
property will, at the very least, yield a profit equal
to the capital to be paid up within the period of
three months ot the first year’s working.
As the stone is so superior, there will be a largo
profit realis d from the sale of cubes, kerbing, and
flagging, as well as screenings for asphalting, of
which many hundred tons are already at grass.
The fact of the quarry being in such close
proximity to the railway and to the stations inter-
mediate to Sydney, the I ompany could sell their
metal at a proportionately less rate than other
competing quarries, and still make large profits.
Attention is also drawn to the immanse superiority
of bed over boulder metal. ...
Mr. Hewitt is so confident of the value of this
property that he has no desire to offer it to the
public on anything like a speculative basis, which
is his reason for having fixed the capital at the
lowest amount requisite to meet the cost of plant
and machinery, and to secure to him a fair interest
in the concern. Should his estimate that 10s on
each share will be sufficient to meet the necessary
outlay be correct, the capital will virtually be still
further reduced.
It will be seen at a glance that, with the many
advantages coupled with an unlimited supply of
stone, the Company possesses unsurpassed induce-
ments, and we can with confidence p ace this local
industry before a discerning public, as offering an
immediate and satisfactory inducement.
Shares will be allotted according to priority of
application, and, to prevent disappointment, early

THIRTY SHILLINGS.
W THIRTY SHILLINGS.
The Autophone!
T H i rs L <rI i imph , of m u8lcal invention is acknow-
ledged on all hands to be the
MOST PERFECT, the MOST UcEFUL,
and the
MOST ENDURABLE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
of modern times.
It is a wonderful little instrument, which, while
It weighs less than three pounds, has the
LUNGS OF A FULL-SIZED PARLOUR ORGAN
and executes its music with
ABSOLUTE PRECISION AND PERFECT
EFFECT.
It has 22 reeds, plays in three keys, and all the
parts of most difficult music.
To Mr. H. B. Horton, the inventor, the world
was first indebted for the Organette ; but that waa
too expensive to come within the reach of all.
After years of persistent effort and intelligent
study, he has been enabled at last to place before
the world this complete little triumph over all
the dilHoullies of costand crudeness.
It requires no skill to extract from it any sort of
music that may be required, the list of three
hundred tunes which it plays comprising selections
from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes, Polkas,
Marches, Popular Songs, Ac., Ac., Ac, A child can
play any of these selections with perfect accuracy
The player requires no Instruction further than
the few printed directions that sre sent with each
instrument, and are so plain that “be who runs
may read.” It is best adapted to the kind of music
which suits an organ best, in which chords pre-
dominate 5 but it has also wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces. It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card-holder for convenience
in singing. It will be found Invaluable for Country
( hutches, Sunday Schools, Family Circles, and
for Dancing. Every shanty In the bush should be
supplied with one ; and every household which
cannot afford a piano or organ should possess an
Autophone. It will afford greater and better
entertainment 1 ban four times the price can pro-
cure if expended in any other direction. Since
they were appointed Sole Agents for this marvel-
ous little instrument in the Australian Colonies,
18 months ago,
THE ORIENTAL GOLD CO.,
or
474 George Street, Sydney,
Opposite the entrance to the Fruit Markets,
have forwarded hundreds of them to different
addresses throughout the colonies. Orders have
come to us from remote stations in the far North,
from distant mining camps, from many a lonely
• hepherd on a far-off run, from farm-hands every-
where, from Sunday-school superintendents, from
clergymen, from residents of the cities—from
everywhere, in fact. And one of the best argu-
ments wo can offer as to the genuineness of the
instrument, is the fact that, in all our corres-
pondence, we hare never had a letter that spoke
disparagingly of It. On the contrary, we have
hundreds of letters on file from customers who
have written only to tell us how greatly they are
pleased with it, and that they will recommend it
to thoir friends.
It is conceded by aU educators and moralists
that music is the great refining influence, and
especially with children, its effect for good is
boundless. The love for music which music in
the family engenders, is more potent in forming
dispositions and governing tempers than all the
treatises and lectures of the whole force of teach-
ers, pastors, and parents, aud la conjunction with
these, is the oil or balm which renders an other-
wise bard task an easy one.
The price of the Autophone la 30*..
and where good music can be procured for such a
trifle, it is criminal for any parent (except, of
course, the absolutely poor) to let his household
be without it. With each Autophone for 30s. wo
send three tunes of our own selection and a listed
catalogue from which the customer may choose
whatever tunes may suit his fancy.
All orders for music are sent post-free by parcel
post, on receipt of list price, and we make it our
business to see that ail orders are promptly
attended to.
Send to us for catalogue of tunes at any time.

It was a little girl, who sat
Upon the step of the stage-door:
She might have been (say) seven years,
Perchance, she might have been much more:
She held a bundle in her hand,
Whose size was pitiful and srnaU ;
She’d treacle smeared upon her face,
And coated thick upon her shawl.
It was a sorry bundle that
She carried, that small fay.
Now, what is it ? ” a critic asked,
Who chanced to pass that way.
She smiled, as she replied, with her
Blue eyes quite bright with joy:-
It’s the prima donna’s washing, and
The tenor's saveloy.”
We’ll see the last of that stupendous moral
lesson. “The Wages of Sin," on Friday, when
another moral lesson will be evolved—presumably
“The Workman,” in wnich ill-treated Alfred im-
personates the persecuted artizan, who is starving
on 15s. a day; or else “The Stranglers of Paris,
which, we understand, though not strictly a
“moral lesson” in its acutest sense, is a cheerful
drama of the “ Tour de Nosle ” order. We remem-
ber when we were young, and too demure to be
acquainted with Barrett’s Twist manipulators of
the other sex, we saw the “ Tour ” at the
Porte 8t. Martin, in Paris. It was a grisly pro-
duction, bristling with blood—so coagulated, so to
speak, with gore, that before it the most frantic
efforts of Mrs. Radoliffe pale their Ineffectual fires.

And this reminds us, in connection with
the Royal, that little Goodie, who has for so many
years been treasurer, is very sick—but not, we are
glad to hear, dangerously so. We are given to
understand that ms place has been temporarily
occupied by the dignified and resplendent Moss.
We were, on the whole, fond of Goodman ; so
regard this intelligence of his illness as a sorrow-
ful story. This to cheer him :—
We hear, now, Goodie, you are cased
In plasters that are porous,
And that this corporeal waste
Is not due to the chorus.
Tho’ we ken—who've known many a “ star ”—
How great a man’s temptations are I
You never took (we know it, zounds I)
A fair and gushing coryphee,
By moonlight, out to courteous “ Brown’s ”
To breathe the ozone of the sea I
No, Goodie, no I we tell you true—
That’s not the matter, now, with you..
» * » *
In a dearth of things dramatic, it is
especial glory to us to put forward into public
prominence a Zoologic exhibition which bids fair
to, in time, outshine the most resplendent dream
of Mr. Frank Buckland, deceased, whose repre-
sentative in this colony (Mr. Walter Bradley) is a
gentleman deserving of Immortalization in its
most effusive form. We visited the Zoological
Gardens in state; and, at once proceeded to inter-
view the lion, whom, we found in a placid, not to
say comatose, condition. We strove by many
allurements to arouse the King of Beasts from
his apathy; but after even being poked with an
umbrella, and bombarded with those nuts which
are popularly supposed to emanate from the
realms of Brasil (but, which we understand, are
raised at Dubbo), he refused to do anything but
hiccup. We then sought out a keeper whose
demeanour was of a confused character, and who
explained, confidentially, that he had only claimed
acquaintance with the Majestic Ruler of the
Forest within the last few weeks, having pre-
viously been pointsman on the tramway line.
* * *
We afterwards paid a visit to the tiger,
who, despite our entreaties, did not even “roar
like a sucking dove,” and was, on the whole, the
personification of feebleness. But. for a fearful
and emphatic fraud, commend us to the turtle.
This animal is about as big as the new Evening
News office, and, should a fitting salary be offered,
could, doubtless, edit that paper with both profit
to its proprietors and credit to itself. Taking
Chris , for example, wo should like to know what
intelligent bandicoot couldn’tconduct . How-
ever, we feel that we can’t conscientiously con-
tinue.
• • *
There are two elephants in the Zoo; on©
which is a baby elephant and one which is not.
The one which is not a baby elephant presents ,a
truculent appearance, and gives one the impres-
sion, rather than otherwise, of being a country
journalist who has met with misfortune while
administering to a rustic public a long-felt Want.
This expression is, in a largo degree, engrafted on
our memory by the manner in which he partook
of refreshment, which we had commanded for
him at a fruit-stall. The last of Alfred’s bards
we invited to the banquet so disguised himself in
jam, that, from the moment of our quitting him,
he had to wander forth a vision enveloped alike
in confusion and in confiture, he degraded con-
dition of the elephant after besmearing himself
with the currants from Bath-buns ; with gnashing
“huself into a foam of cheap lollies, was coeval
with this. It was abject. It was more than abject;
it was dissolute; it was degraded. We gazed upon
nisface with peculiar interest. He had, we are bound
to admit, the brand of literature stamped upon him
so far as his ears were concerned, they being of
the ragged sort inseparable to pursuits poetic.

It is finally announced that Miss de Grey
will take her farewell in “Adrienne Leoouvreur,”
a favourite role ot Bernhardt’s, and the “ let ” Is
stated to be an abnornmal one. Tantmieux! We
like beauty to be patronised, no matter what else
on the side of the sublimely artistic may be want-
ing. But, there, what’s the good of talking ?
Hundreds of our pipe-clayed heroes don’t agree
with us, we know. And we don’t want to tall out
with the military—at cur age. Being on walking-
stick and revolver terms with the “ perfesh ” is
quite glory enough for us at present. W® can t
conveniently wear more than one plaster at a
time.
Miss de Grey will not be succeeded, as we
had fervently hoped, by “Bobadil” (a new and en-
tirely original opera, by Luscombe Searelle, Esq.,
the libretto by Walter Parke, sic), but by a young
professional person, yclept Miss Marie Lanyon. Miss
Mar Canyon introduces into this country the
so-called • beautiful American play of * Young
Mrs. Wlnthrop.’ ” upon which the New York
papers, exhaust themselves in encomiastic notices,
we shall view the production of “Young Mrs.
Wlnthrop with special interest, and we only trust
to heaven there will be nothing of Bartley Camp-
beiiism enshrouding the productions.
• • •
To supersede, however, “Young Mrs. Win-
throp,” it is an undoubted fact that Luscombe
Searelle,Esq.— the translucent author of “Estrella,”
The Fakir of Travancore,” “The Wreck of the
Flnafcre,” and other glittering productions—will
toiiow on with another superb emanation from a
pram which is nothing if not. eminently operatic,
it is given to us>, in so many prose sentences, to
understand that “Bobadil,” so far as its book is
concerned, is partly the work of WaKer Parke,
Esq., and partly, as in the case of that undoubted
success, “ Estrella,” the joint production of both
composer and librettist. It is no figure of speech
—far from it!—when we put promptly forward the
fact that Mr. Searelle is indisposed in a general way
to expose the libretti of his operatic successes to
the vulgar gaze of the critics. We have begged
the composer, with tears in our eyes and eagerness
gnawing the check-strings of our heart, to let us
catch only one glimpse of that “ Bobadil” which is
being already wafted towards us upon the tidal-
roave of an electric success, but the maestro merely
shakes hla head, and says nothing. This reminds
us that, when shaking his bead and saying nothing,
the Chosen satellite of Euterpe, &o, puts forth more
eloquence than is occasionally to be found in vol-
umes. Thanks, however, to the kindness of a rather
attractive young lady who retails rum in a dUgagi
manner at a theatrical - pub. (and who evidently
proved too much for the inflammable Luscombe)
we have been enabled to secure a copy of “ Es-
trella.” and to light up the pages of this Journal,
in rather a dull week, by a couple of extracts from
lyrics in that work. Lend your ears, now, ladies
and gentlemen, to the music of this:
N o.'l.—Q ONDOLIED.
(Chorus of girls off Stage unseen.)
“ Far o’er the moon-tipped sea
We come, we come to thee;
Fal lal lal la I Fal lal lal la!
We sight right merrily.
Let pleasure be unconflned,
For love is upon the wind;
Fal lal lal lal Fal lal lal la!
No matter if he be blind; [!11J
We bring a greeting of joy to thee,
We sing our sweetest melody;
Each spirit is glad to-night,
And thrills with a wild dcl'ght.”
We feel that we can feelingly (and conscientiously,
of course,) congratulate the writer upon the
touching 1 simplicity of this lyrical gem—though It
has occurred to us that he must, at one time, have
got the loan of (say) Cyril Haviland’s slippers, for
there is a distinct similarify between “And thrills
with a wild delight,” and C. H.’simmortal line "I’ll
melt in pure delight.” And having modestly put
forward this much, we will merely (since this is a
free country) modestly murmur “Pa 1
on our own account, and pass on „o - uate
things. Here is another lyrical slab:
“ I am here, I am here, to be nearer to thee;
It is I, it is I, thy lover.
I am waiting and watching; oh, come, tome. my
love!
For the stars tears of dew are wooning;
And the moon gleameth bright in the heavens
above,
As I wait, my lone vigil keeping.
So come, for this heart is aching, my love!
Never again we’ll part.
Then come, for ’tis nearly breaking, my Jove,
For thee —for thee, sweetheart.”
Poor old moon! At her again! Ever was the
stern hand of fate levelled against that unfortun-
ate orb I Thoy have no pity, thiseWh/efu.. mongers.
To write of her seems to possess, for t'j. m, some
sort of weird fascination. We shoulu tnink the
moon must be getting pretty “full” hy i his time.
And so ‘ Fal lal lal lal—and four sti rs.” Four
stars come as a pleasing variety alter so much
moon.

sent stand, Mr. Grattan Higgs takes, from an in-
trinsically critical view, the premier position at

whatevi r that, even in the poor aeries or sensa-
tional pictures, in which he appears, Mr. Higgs
stands out, in bold relief, a protean aotor of emi-
nent ability. His performance, indeed, is extraor-
dinary, if only from the fact of his marvellously
rapid changes, and the curiously composed
humour (for it is that) with which ho embodies
periods extracted out of a rather bald dialogue.

Sam Poole to state he seemed to acquire much
popularity by his impersonation of Johnny Lem-

WHO KNOWS ?
We take this interesting item from the
entertaining columns of Alfred:— “Elizabeth
M’Clurkey, 80 years of age, was fined 10s. (in de-
fault two days’ imprisonment) by Mr. Addison.
S.M., in the Water Police Court yesterday, for
having been drunk in Crown-lane. For having
used obscene language in the same thoroughfare,
she was fined £5, in default three months’ impri-
sonment.” There is no reverence paid to age in
this country—a state of things which some his-
torian has said indicates the decline of a nation.
We have some policemen in this city who would
arrest the patriarch Methusaleh for vagrancy if
they met him, and some magistrates who would
give him three months without the option as soon
as take a drink. So it is but little cause for
wonder that the venerable gentlewoman, Eliza-
beth M'Clurkey, got no mercy at their hands.
This impels us to cheer her with a verse. The
coffin-plate, Alonzo! Now I
Ten years above the lot allowed to mortal
Hast thou lived here, O, ancient Betty,
Only to stand at the police court portal,
At eighty years, for some offences petty I
But take this truth to cheer thee in the station,
There is no ill but has its compensation;
In ten years more —if thou’rt not laid upon the
shelf—
Thou wilt most likely he a magistrate thyself!

It is said that over sixty acres of crops
have been destroyed on one farm in Victoria by
grubs. It is a melancholy thing to see grubs de-

The boys of St. Augustine’s school, Bal-
main, have assured Archbishop Moran in an address
that “ religious education ” was “ as dear as life to
them.” It is well that his Grace did not put them
to the test by giving them the choice between re-
ligious education and a set of cricket stumps. If
he had, we would have backed the stumps.
While the Dead March was being played
in a country church, out of z'espect to an old resi-
dent, who had quitted this life the day before, a
grizzled party got up and walked stiffly out of the
building, remarking that he “didn’t believe in
them there d d high church notions.” He
thought it was to be part of the service in future.
There was a man charged with stealing a
copy of the Jernkl last week. He did not plead
temporary insanity. Consequently, he got seven
days. He should have got seven years. The man

In Wagga Wagga dwells a policeman who,
when asked the time, puts his hand into his
trousers pocket and pulls therefrom an egg-
shaped timepiece. There was considerable con-
fusion a day or to ago when he drew a raw potato
from the depths of his pocket. It was accounted
for by th? fact that he was an Irishman, and
boarded himself.
A gigantic earthworm, measuring be-

While a circus band was being drawn round
Cooma, the driver of the van drove over an em-
bankment and capsized the concern, thereby
changing the tune. When the excitement had
worn off, it was found that the clarionet-player’s
head was so tightly jammed into the bell of the
bass-player’s instrument as to necessitate hissleep-
ing in it till the swelling in his head went down.
The orchestra for that night consisted of the big
drum.
The Church of England Assembly have
resolved to petition the Legislative Assembly In
Victoria to prohibit the publication In the press of
divorce case reports. So says a contemporary. We
are surprised at this We do not think that minis-
ters should compel the females of their congrega-
tions to attend the Divorce Courts. This will be
the result If the petition is successful. For It Is
hardly necessary to say that the women will know
all about the cases, whatever the cost.
In a certain large office where the hour of
attendance is 9.15 a.m., a red line is drawn at that
time, and all clerks arriving later have to sign the
time and cause of being late. At 9.45 a.m. the
book is taken away and examined by an official,
whose duty It Is to see that no one offends too
often. Invariably the cause is “ train late.” But
a smile spread over that official’s countenance
when, one morning, he found that fifty clerks,
who had signed “ ditto ” to the first late arrival
(the usual eustom), owed their late arrival to
being “ knocked down by a cab.”
From an English paper ‘ An Australian
anecdote tells us of a convict who got on so well
ou that side of the world that he rose to the
magistracy, and on his making some harsh reflec-
tions on a person Brought before him, whom he

money. T remember the time in England when I
should have liked much less to meet you with 5».

The erratic movements of an up-country
editor had long passed unnoticed, it being thoucht
that the intellectual struggle of writing a weekly
leader, in open conflict with the views expressed
by a butcher who had just won a fierce victory
over a blacksmith in an aldermanic contest, was
enough to Induce a little temporary aberration.
But when he was overheard to say something
about making a will, and about squabbles over his
“property” after his death, it was at once seen
that he was “gone.”
It is chronicled that the bank manager of
Blauktown went away from there one day last
week. It is net said how much he took with him.
Perhaps, however, the gentleman has simply been
transferred to another post. If so, the above
chronicle amounts to libel. When a bank manager
leaves a town, and there is no reason to judge that
he has run away with the money, that latter fact
should be distinctly stated. The absence of speci-
fic statement keeps the public asking, “How
much ? how much ? ’
That party of irresponsible Legislative
Council and “ first-family ” politicians who are the
chief, and, in fact, only means by which press laws
long obsolete in all civilised countries are affec-
I tionately maintained in N.8. Wales, are the kind
of people who regret the good old days in which
gibbets and gallows were ordinarily referred to as
1 roadmarks. “You leave the township on your
right, and pass the gallows on your left.” When
shall we pass these politicians on the political
gibbet, or in the hearse ?
“ Pastepot,” an Inverell printer, makes
mistakes which would be humorous, if they were
wilful, but they are not—he is quite innocent of
wit. Some time ago he printed that “Australian
wines were making their way into flavour.” We
suppose he meant favour, not bouquet; wine is
above his ken. The musical club he once desig.
nated as a “ chloral society.” Ho meant choral,
not the narcotic, although the music had a drowsy
tune about It. He now prints that “thirteen
pints of water fell at Warialda.” Why, “Pastepot”
could consume the same quantity of beer any day
between two paragraphs—and still his paper be as
dry a rag as ever.
The Queanbeyan Dramatic Club gave a
burnt cork show a few nights since; but it was too
lively for the townspeople. One of the end-men,
who had Joseph’s coat of many colours, and Mar-
wood's cheek, so represented an Indian tobacco-
sign that a local tobacconist wanted to negotiate
for his purchase next day. The thrilling part of
the entertainment was the singing of a ballad,
“ My Best Friend.” The singer’s best friend did
not happen to be the accompanist, ns each ground
out an air of his own, and to prevent a positive
break-down, two or three of the other performers
clutched at the air, and sailed along In different
ways. A dog-fight would now hit public taste
with more advantage.
There s hope of England’s national debt
being wiped off the slate after all, and, palmam qut
meruit ferat, It is the much maligned “Lords”
this time who have saved their bleeding country
just as those other geese once saved Rome. A
sweeping economy has now been made in one
branch of the British Naval Service. “ My Lords ”
have discovered that, in some cases, flue-brushes
have been purchased for coastguard stations, and
they have directed that In future these Important
and expensive articles are not to be provided at the
expense of the Crown, but must be paid for by the
crews of the Reserve ships. Britannia rales the
waves, but she draws the line at flue-brushes.
It was in the office of the leading organ of
public opinion in the Boulburn Vale. The edi-
tor, who had been unavoidably absent all the
morning, came in as the first sheet was being
pulled off the manvie. He held it out before him,
and a thrill of pride began to shake his frame,
but was arrested by a sneeze. When he got clear
of his attack, his eye met an item of Police Court
business commencing, “ A low-looking scoundrel
was brought up nefore the Bench on Tuesday
morning—.” “Stop the press,” cried the editor:
unlock the everlasting thing, and change that.

The fares from the country districts in
Victoria to Melbourne during Cup week, and while
the racing fever is on, will be, the railway authori-

tion of Melbourne people want to get far into the

They say they think horsa-racing immoral, an
that, irrational as the fare was, they always ha\ e

which bus annually showed itself in the faces oi
country cousins. They had sent their “ one J f !,"

ad never got anything in return. Then they na
said, “ We"ll find them at Cup time.” Now *

On a False Footing.


Bishop Moorhouse has been telling (he
cultured people of Kyneton tbat a devout believer
In many things having come to doubt the efficacy
of prayer, suggested a practical way of testing
the truth of the Church's doctrine. “We are
troubled with rabbits,” said this strange Christian.
“ 1 hey are so prolific that killing millions of them
leaves us in a week just as we were. Now, try a
broadside of prayer on them. Pray to God to
curse them with sterility.” The Bishop declines
to apply this test, not through any mercy for the
rabbits, but on the specious ground that it is
reasonably within the power of man to subdue
rabbits, and that prayer is only to be bad recourse
to when the object is unattainable by human
effort. This is a familiar position for the Bishop
to assume In respect to prayer; but without
implying that his Anglican Didymus’s test of
sterility is more than a sterile test Dr. Moorhouse
should be invited to explain clearly what praying
for daily bread amounts to. it 1s reasonably
within the power of the great majority of the
people to obtain by his own efforts “ this day's
bread.” Is it therefore unnecessary for this great
majority to use this prayer ? And if unnecessary,
why do they do it ?

A party writes us, from Corowa, evidently
about matters theatrical: but we can’t, for the life
of us, make out what he’s driving at. His hand-
writing is more exasperating than a plate of Philllp-
street hash, and his manner ot spelling Corowa is
an insult of a gory character. His signature is
“ Jobuz,” or “Jacobs,” or “Johnson”—it might be
“ Smith; ” and he airly gives us the following slab
of enthralling intelligence “ Currowa.—Will

when we gravely state that we get, on an average,

This is epidemic. “Poor Player” again,

ing professional gentlemen, heads of educational
institutions, a number of the clergy, representa-
tives of the squatting, commercial, and agricul-
tural Interests, the licensed victuallers, the ladies
of the district who have also gracefully accorded
their valued patronage, and the generous public

and intends to perform shortly in the principal
London and Continental cities, commencing with
Jamberoo And you remember our old friend
Blanche Corelli, erst with Salisbury’s Troubadours:
well, she is in New York, flourishing with Catherine
Lewis, whose death we have long and industriously
prayed for, and who is a star in a new opera-bouffe
called “ Madame Boniface,” the right of which will
doubtless be secured for Australia by that illustri-
ous entrepreneur, Arthur Garner, Esq... Oh I and
listen. Tne rage for burlesque and the ballet has
suddenly come upon us. Opera-bouffe wl-'l soon
be, so to speak, a thing of the past. We shall then
have to dish up dreary memories of Taglionl, and
Fanny Ellsler; to talk of figurantes and oallerines ;
to gossip of pas de basque entrechdts, and the like.
And would you like to hear that the
Penrith Sons of Temperance have purchased a new
piano for their hall, and purpose wrestling with
Shakespeare at an early date? And that, at the
Academy of Music, Carcoar, Mr. Byers and Miss
Julia Hudson, assisted by a party called Plummer
(with whose identity we are. in our Ignorance, un-
acquainted), appeared on the 37th ultimo. We
have known Mr. Byers for seventeen thousand
years, and have notched his skull with our little
hatchet on several occasions. Wo have also fre-
quently stirred into his portergaff, Insecticide in
large quantites, besides having soaked him with in-
flammable materials and set fire to him with torches
whenever we found it convenient. But It was
useless. He was beetle-poison proof, and could
spread “Rough on Rats” upon his bread-and-
butter with impunity. He laughed “ Ha, hal” at
the dangers of the fiery elements, and his deter-
mination to live and flourish even caused strych-
nine to recoil powerless from his massive but ma-
jestic figure. Well, all we can say is, we have
done our best to kill him, and, if we have not suc-
ceeded, It is not the fault of deadly weapons either
subtle or otherwise. 8o, sweet public, hurry up
with our little statue.. . .The Marian Willis com-
pany (including the abnormally-gifted Keogh)
have vacated the Victoria Theatre. Newcastle, for
Plattsburg. Hiscocks’ Federal Minstrels opened
there last Saturday to enormous business. The
Minstrels play overland to Wagga: do a night or
two there, and then travel on to Melbourne. Of
the style of criticism adopted by the Newcastle
Hanby, we give tbe following enlivening sampje:
—“ Johnny Cowan came next, and his topicalities
about settled it. He knocked the last laugh out of
us, and we had to creep out quietly or perish in the
attempt.” A man who could write like this
would flourish in a country exclusively populated
with guano ...St. Leon, it seems, is at Cooper-
nook, and Cundlotown, and Taree, and Wingham,
and Tinonee. The gifted Gus. announces large
additions to the personnel of his hippie opera:
Tasmanian devils, Tasmanian tigers, a bandicoot
that manipulates successfully the jew's-harp, and
a performing camel. We see that Horace Maudes-
ley is the business agent; though, who in thunder
Horace Maudesley is, if he be not the performing
camel, is to us a dark and sanguinary mystery —
This is a little droll. The Armidalb Chronicle,
in a recent issue, has the following:—“ Woman
against Woman," at the Sydney Opera House, is a
most lascivious play, and is consequently well
patronised.” Well, A C., we saw " Woman against
Woman,” but it didn t shock us particularly. We
considered even there was a stern strain of
morality pervading it. We advise A.C., should
it wish tor reliable information on things theatri-
cal, to limit its metropolitan boot-closer to (say)
sixteen pints. He may then chance to pos-
sess a dim glimmering of what takes place
on the stage of the theatre in the pit of which
he glows, on stipulated nights, with Bardolphian
fire. ..Yes; and Count Lorenzo de Mentemenln,
an unsuccessful tenor, has committed suicide at
Florence. He lived in London a long time before
he made his d£bU. and then his name was Johnson.
• •••The Cottiers have just been going it in Parra-
matta, their performance completely, apparently,
enthralling the illustrious Percy, and imbuing
the Parramatta populace with an Insensate love of
burnt cork... .And a big New fork sensation is a
PJ®°® called “Adonis,” from which, however, our
old friend, Carrie Godfrey, was shunted with de-
cisive despatch, being, as they alleged, too bad a
study' for the contralto part. ..Just time for
this. Twenty-live circus people were burnt in a
railway journey from Denver to Bgerton (Wiscon-
sin). Here is a little bit from the middle of the
report:—“The heartrending cries of the men on
the prairie smothered the appeals of the dying in
the oar, while the roar of the flames and the howl-
ing of the animals made the tragedy terrible be-
yond description. The odour of roasting flesh and
the distant cry of the coyotes added to the general
horror of the occasion.” The astounding conclu-
sion of this cheerful chronicle is as under:—“The
cause of the lire could not be ascertained, as the
managers, with the rest of the company, left imme-
diately for Golden, to fill an engagement.” ...
Kate Castleton, who sent us out so much pretty
paper announcing her approaching advent, won't
come, after all. There will be tears shed over this;
but, after it is all over, who in thunder is Kate
Castleton?....Chlarini‘s circus is doing immense
business in Auckland; and, if we don’t give this
additional gem from “Estrella,” we should, as
Woodfleld used to pathetically remark, “posi-
tively explah”:—
“ My dearest, sweetest, most angelic bride,
Your husband’s gone for ever from your side,
And as I write my soul within is vexed
Por fear that every breath will be my next.”
Boohl This breathes the pure spirit of—some-
thing, or something’s pure spirit. Not rum, of
course—Our old pal, Dan. Harkins, is punishing
the sock land buskin at Chicago; Ristori is at the

the illustrious Thynne of this, that Henry E.

crable style?) Galatea sides with Mr. Abbey
With the rank and file of the theatrical profession
here, writes our London correspondent, things are
far from bright. Hundreds of actors are out of
employment, and two fairly good men (one of
whom had not succeeded in getting an engage-
ment for three years) committed suicide within a
week. The cry everywhere is that amateurs, who
do not depend on the stage for a livelihood, are
taking the bread out of the mouths of the pro-
fessionals; that the stock-actor will soon bo a
thing of the past; and that hard-working intelli-
gent mediocrity will not be rewarded, as in days
of yore, with an honest competence, but with
starvation. The actor, as he is known to the
Australians, was infinitely better off ere his art was
patronised by the “cream of modern birth and
fashion.” As with the actor, so with the artist and
the Journalist, Hundreds and thousands of people
act or paint or write for mere amusement, or next
door to it; or, on the other hand, they act or paint
or write in order that they may live, but they only
succeed in starving. In law and medicine, which
ate, justly or unjustly, protected professions,
matters are somewhat better—though no doubt
the early struggles of a friendless doctor in Eng-
land are no lees severe than were those of the
author of “ The Diary of a late Physician.” One
qualified doctor is glad to get from you three
shillings for advice and medicine; another, who
lives in Cavendish-square, takes two guineas every
time he opens his front door. The condition of the
theatrical, artistic, and literary markets—not so
much in regard to first-class wares as in respect
to the productions of all but men and women with
fashionable names-seems to be here really dread-
ful. You go to a “picture slaughter-house,” or
cheap auction-room, and see hundreds and hun-
dreds of decent and thousands of bad paintings,
representing an eternity of work, sold for a mere
song—a BhllTli.gr or two apiece. Then the theatrical
manager tells you that he can get more good
supers, than he wants at a shilling a night—these
supers, consisting of either aspirants for higher
theatrical positions, or of broken-down actors,
who are—Heaven help them I—glad to earn a dozen
coppers a day to keep themselves out of the
Thames or the work-house. A man drives up to
the stage-door In a dog-cart, attended by a gor-
geous flunkey. The master’s name is probably
Adolphus Montmorencl Fltzolarence; he is are-
tired captain of a swell regiment; he has private
money, which enables him to live en seigneur,
while he accepts £1 a week from the theatrical
manager, who is sometimes a necessitous gentle-
man, compelled to make economies in all direc-
tions, and just as often an arrant cad who Is only
too delighted to make a friend of the ex-guards-
man by allowing that worthy the run of his stage,
while he, the manager, saves the three or four
pounds a week he would otherwise have to pay to
the unhappy stock-actor. In the elegant words of
Mr. Barney Thompson, when anticipating the
result of the Melbourne Cup, it is. all round, a case
of “ shin of beef or roast turkey.” The age of the
happy medium seems to have passed away
Ristori is coming back again .(says a N.Y. paper).
The dear old lady is about old enough to be a great-
great-grandmother, but she will begin her second
stage career in English for the exclusive benefit of
the American public ...The .now eminent Lord
Randolph Churchill says: “I don’t know that I
should call Irvine a great actor, but he is certainly
a curious one. He is always I rving on the stage,
and always Hamlet in private Me.”...Mary Ander-
son, whose opening nights (as Galatea and Clarioe)at
the London Lyceum, after h>er return from the
provinces, were a tremendous success, said, when
interviewed; “ I wonder what kind friend Invented
the story that ascribes to me the intention to be-
come a Carmelite nun ? I have never entertained
the intention of taking the veil.”... Teddy
M’Lean has returned to Sydney with a visage
rubicund with hilarity, an d he wishes us to
state that he has paralysed them with his

The brilliant genius that guides the
destinies of the Forbes and Parkes Ga-
zette spreads himself out in this style :—
“Talking about the habits of the lower orders
of creation has caused us not only to con-
sider, but to be surprised at the habits of ladies in
different towns wherein we have sojourned. In
Sydney the dear creatures paint, wear eye-glasses,
and go to the opera; in Goulburn, they talk poli"
tics and precedence; but in Forbes, they ask the
police if they know where their husbands are ?”

A strange duel took place in Berlin in 1867,
between a working jeweller and another artisan.
The only weapon chosen was a bottle of vitriol. It
was decided that the one who threw the smallest
number of points at dice should swallow the con-
tents of the fatal phial. Fate favoured the
jeweller, who at once poured out for his anta-
gonist a glass of the liquid. What was his astonish-
ment when, instead of seeing his enemy fall in
agony to the ground, to hear him smack his lips
and call for "another glass I” The witnesses had
had the good sense to substitute gin for the vitriol
and the affair terminated in a laugh.
This happened at Spitzbergen, or Spam,
or somewhere. Excited editor to sub: “ I say. Mr.
Blank, what’s the meaning of that heap of papers
in the cellar ?” Sub: “ Oh, they’re 10,000 copies of
our last week’s Daily Dustbin.” “ 10,000 copies
of last week’s Daily Dustbin! Why in thunder
were they not disposed of?” “Impossible, sir:
couldn’t sell ’em—no one cared to buy ’em.”
“ Well, s’pose you couldn’t sell ’em, why the d—1
didn’t y’ give ’em away ? Don’tcherknow th’ ac-
countant’s cornin’ round next month t’ certify to
enormous increase of our daily circulation ? Enter
’em up as Issued at once, and then as soon as its
quite dark pack ’em off to Gudgeon’s fish-shop

oracle in Spitzbergen, Spain, or somewhere.

that the advent of Free-trade would inaugurate a
golden age. Has it done so ? The fact is, it was

Moonee Valley races on Saturday last.
Evie won the All-Aged Stakes; the Ngarleno

Belling Race; Meteor, Irralee, and Yately finished
in the order named for the Moonee Valley Cup;
Clown won the Steeplechase; and Prodigal won

A pigeon race has been flown between 1000
carrier pigeons, from Dover to Brussels—a distance
of 140 miles in a straight line. The birds were
brought over from Ostend in baskets. After being
liberated, they ascended at once to a great height,
and then headed for Brussels. Within three
minutes they were out of sight.
re the |Hanlan-Beach race, the New
York Clipper says: “ Further particulars of this

Lovely Weather for the opening day of the

last. The afternoon passed off without a hitch,
and was altogether an Improvement upon the re-

A French gentleman, viewing a cricket
match at Lord’s, in London,!aaked a neighbour to
explain the difference between “ gentleman ” and
“player,” and got the answer: “A‘gentleman’is
one who plays tor play; a ‘ player ’ one who plavs
for pay.” “Thanks,” replied the Frenchman;
“ then that gamin I asked just now was not gam-
moning me when he said there was a ‘1’ of a dif-
ference.”
The 34-footers Lottie, Victor, and Dream-
land showed out in their war-paint on Sunday last,
and a spanking North-easter gave the crews a
good opportunity for practice. The three crews
landed at North Harbour, and in the afternoon the
boats had a grand run home. The Lottie and
Dreamland contented themselves with fore and
aft sails, but the Victor tore through it like a
steamer, under topsail and squaresail.
The English papers are just beginning to
admit that the Australians have been " fairly suc-
cessful” this trip. Thus the Standard: “It has
been said over and over again that the success of
the Australian cricketers in this country has been
due more to Spofforth’s bowling than to any other
cause, and now, as the fourth tour draws to a
close, the fact becomes more palpable than ever.”
So it’s “all along of that wicked Spoff.I”
A correspondent recently asked a Sydney
weekly the fastest time “Black Charley” Rey-
nolds had performed over the champion course.
The answer was incorrectly given as 30min, 48sec.
Reynolds, with a swinging ebb tide under him and
feather-white westerly behind him, rowed, or
rather was blown over the course, in 30min. 8sec.
—the fastest on record. We clocked the race with
a reliable watch, and, strange to say, it was the
only boat-race we ever ;saw three watches agree
about.
Mr. Jack Want has resigned the office of
Commodore of the P.A.Y. Club, which he had only
just accepted. The club will find it difficult to re-
place so thorough a yachtsman and gonial a host.
Rumour has it that this gentleman is in treaty for
the Mistral, with a view to a trip among the
Islands. By the way, “ ’tis an ill wind that blows
nobody good,” and the late owner of the Mignon-
ette may congratulate himself that her faulty
condition was proved in so unmistakable a manner,
before he committed himself and his party to her
treacherous keeping in the South Seas.
The junior teachers held their annual
sports at Clontarf on Saturday last. The 1st, 2nd,
3rd, and 4th class 100 yards races fell to Berry,
Cummings, Herd, and Roberts respectively. The
1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th class mile walks were won by
Bullock and Shaw respectively; Hewitt threw the
cricket-ball 98 yards; D. Berry won the champion
150 yards; Gray won the 440 yards ex-students’
handicap; Davis won the long jump; Herd won
the 160 yards hurdle race; Thom won the mile
run; Sbute annexed the hoo-step-and-jump ; and
Kelly and Giles appropriated the three-legged
race.
The Double Bay Regatta programme has
filled up well, and given a fine breezy day on
Saturday next, the popular fixture promises to
pass off with its customary success, thanks to the
untiring efforts of the hon. sec., Mr. Stafford, and
the committee. Ellis’ last edition to the mosquito
fleet of half-deckers, Mr. Trebeck’s Wanganella,
will make her maiden effort, but until she proves
herself, we shall remain of opinion that extreme
dead weight in beamy craft of her description will
detract from speed, 'We should not be surprised
to see the Wanganella unable to obtain a place in
her class.
A French writer (in Le Charivari) has
some remarks on the great victory of the English
Eleven over the Australians at Lord’s. The colo-
nials, so the wondering Parisians are told, had
made the long voyage expressly to match their
strength against the champions of the mother
eountry. The mother beat her children, and beat
them very decisively. The vanquished children
could not stomach the blow. One of them has
already committed suicide, and four others are dan-
gerously ill! Clearly, as the astonished writer
observes, one can see that the struggle, begun in
play, has become serious.
The Football Union has at last decided the
disputed Universlty-Burwood match as “un-
finished,” and the Suburbans may be awarded the
cake as last season’s boss team. For the Cup,
Burwood defeated Balmain twice, by 15 to nil and
16 to 4; University once, by 7 to nil; Wallaroo
once, by 26 to nil; and Redfern once, by 11 to nil;
and suffered their only defeat at the hands of Wal-
laroo, by 5 to 2. In addition to the Cup matches,
the Bur woods fairly ran over 20 Wellesleys by 38
to nil; St. Leonards, by 9 to nil; and Goulburn
twice, by 23 and 24 to nil respectively. If next
year the up-the-liners show up to last year’s
form, we would suggest a Burwood v, combined
team on the list of fixtures.
W. Gr. George has made up his mind to re-
tire from the path, as far as England is concerned,
at the end of the present season, but before he
does so will try to alter a few more records. The
London Athletic Club made the following arrange-
ments for him, viz.:—Ho was to attempt to beat
record at 1000 yards in the open handicap at that
distance, at the L. A. C. First Autumn Meeting on
the 27th Sept. At the Second Autumn Meeting on
Oct. 11, prizes were offered for a mile handicap re-
stricted to 20 competitors, and with a 120 yards
limit in order to give him a chance to have a out
at the 1500 yards and mile times, and a week later
he was again to essay the task of beating the
Deerfoot feat of 11 miles 970 yards in an hour.
The small use made by the junior cricket-
ers of the opportunity afforded them by the senior
association and ground trustees to show what
they could do on a good turf wicket, would
imply that the youngsters’ ambition reaches no
further than the watch chain babule and tin pot
business. In our day the highest pinnacle of bliss
a cricketer could aspire to was to represent his
colony in an Intercolonial or International match,
but tne youngsters of to-day would appear to
have different aspirations, or they surely would
not have made such a poor response on Saturday
last. Donnan, Searle, and Sparkes showed excel-
lent form, and we should not be surprised to hear of
them in the first flight before long, provided they
do not get out of their depth and too big to accept
a hint or two.
“ E.N.R.” asks the time for the fastest 100
yards in Australia, and who by. Hewett is stated
to have covered the distance in 9% seconds, but
wo are of opinion that even time has never been
beaten in Australia—or any other part of the
world, given a correctly-measured, level track,
and reliable dockers. Seward is credited with 9!4
seconds, but how was the “ record ” obtained ? In
1844, watches were not quite up to the pitch of per-
fection we have them now, and when Seward ran
the race under notice, the time-keeper stated it
was done under ten seconds, but aby-atander, who
was said, in a paper of the day giving an account
of the race, to be the owner of a splendid watch,
cried out the correct time was 9J4 seconds. If our
memory serves us aright, the “by-stander” was
in some way connected with Seward, so that the
“ record ” is a very shady one indeed.
Cricket, as a manly honest sport, is knocked
clean over the fence at last, and “gate-money ” is
the name of the party who struck the blow The
Rotherham (England) Council Club are seriously
thinking of dragging the noble pastime through
tbe mire of the local Court, and this is the casus
belli: It appears that the Rotherham Council Club
recently arranged with the captain of a Derby-
shire club to bring a first-class eleven over to
Rotherham and play a friendly game of cricket.
That was agreed to; but the Derbyshire man sub-
sequently sent an inferior team, the Rotherham
citizens flatly refused to pay for the privilege of
looking at a lot of “dom’d moofs,” and the result
was that when the gate-money was totted up, the
Rotherham club found themselves £40 on the
wrong side of the ledger. This proves that the
money-grabbing, pot-hunting, gate-money spirit
has fairly collared cricket now, and the sooner we
give up talking about the “ manly game ” and call
it the “shady spec.,” the sooner will we get tbe
credit for calling things by their proper names.
The World rubs it into Murdoch and Co.
thusly" That the Australians, when they win,
do so by sheer superiority of play, and when they
lose, lose by a combination of untoward casualties
—bad light, bad weather, bad ground, bad um-
pires, and so forth—has long been an accepted rule,
if not with each member of the eleven, at least
with the majority, and certainly with their own
countrymen. They are attended, it seems, by a
special reporter, who forwards his own accounts
of the matches to one of the Australian papers.
According to this Imaginative and patriotic scribe,
nearly all the bowling in England is unfair, and all
the umpires rogues—all the umpires, that is of
course to say, who have over given decisions ad-
verse to his countrymen. It also appears, by a
letter signed ‘Australian,’ in Bell’s Life, that
this team is very far indeed from being representa-
tive of the cricketing strength of Australia. It
consists only ef Murdoch’s old friends and oom-
S anions, and contains none of the best bats and
owlers of Victoria or New South Wales. Mur-
doch, says the writer, has only himself to thank
for ‘putting eleven cripples in the field against
Kent, Sussex, and Gloucestershire ’—three of the
matches, it will be observed, in which these
‘cripples’ (who have certainly marvellous powers
of resuscitation) came off decidedly second-best.”
Now that the phenomenal champ , we
mean the Canadian sculler, Hanlan, has thrown a
glamour of glory over the prize distribution re-
cently held in St. Philip’s Grammar School by
handing over the literary trophies, and letting off
a goody-goody oration, we don’t see why the
thing shouldn’t be passed along, and a few other
distinguished muscular heroes be requested to
honour our coming Shakespeares, Miltons, and
Macaulays by their patronage. For instance, St.
Mary’s next school shivoo might be presided over
by Larry Foley, as a set-off against the Prods, of
St. Philip’s; Alick Bannerman could orate in his
own polished style to the Congregatlonallsts;
Bibby, the porridge-pasting champion, would be
able to deliver a telling address on the benefits of
an mscetic life to the Wesleyan crowd ; Donald
Dinnie would be all at home at St. Andrew’s, and
who could be found more suitable to lead the
Hebrew School festivities than Mr. Cricketer
Moses ? The University might then catch on to the
same idea, and secure the services of Dave Ingram,
who could “pitch a barrak” to the students in
Greek choice enough to make Sophocles turn
green in his grave with envy. Taking it alto-
gether, thie is one of the best notions we have
struck for years; and as muscle is god to-day.
where can we find better patrons that the DU
major es!
London Truth apologises thuslySome
three months ago I published certain ‘ facts' sent
mo by a trustworthy correspondent in connexion
with the early matches played by the Australian
team at Lord’s. Amongst these ‘ facts ’ was the
statement that ‘the cheque they received was for
£1344 17s., for which their representative did not
even say ‘Thank you.’ I have since had the op-
portunity of meeting some of the members of the
team, and they have shown me a letter that they
received soon after my paragraph appeared from
Mr. Henry Perkins, of the M.O.C., in which that
gentleman remarks that the statement is incor-
rect, and that they have his authority for saying
‘ that the thanks of the team were tendered for
the liberality of the M.C.C. in the most courteous
manner possible.’ I, therefore, think it but fair,
although so long a time has elapsed, and although
the representatives of the Australians did not con-
sider it necessary at the time to refute the state-
ment, to give them the advantage of this contra-
diction. Whilst on this subject, I might remark
that other statements that have been made from
time to time in various quarters as to the eleven
having their luncheons and drinks for nothing are
equally unjust. It Seems to be forgotten that
when one person becomes the guest of another, it
is usual for the host to perform these acts of
courtesy. If a man accepts an invitation out to
dinner, he would hardly appreciate being sneered
at and told that he had his food and wine for
nothing; and so, I take it, it is with the Aus-
tralians.’’

The billiard tournament at Melbourne for
Messrs. Alcock’s prize terminated as anyone with
any knowledge Evans’ English form knew it must
do, the South Australian representative polishing
off Weiss in the final heat with just as much ease
as he had disposed of Byrne in the first. The great
feature of the play was the winner’s “ spot strok-
ing,” beside which Weiss’efforts in the same de-
partment of the game appeared quite amateurish.
Billiards, now-adays, resolves Itself into a question
of the “spot,” pure and simple, and the best red
hazard striker makes light of the most brilliant
“ all round ” play of his opponents. Playing with
Weiss and Byrne, Evans could afford to work the
red to the top of the table Without any fear of
being beaten at his own game, and played out for
shots which he would fight shy of if opposed to
such men as John Roberts or Peall, inasmuch as
they, in their best form, would hold almost as
great an advantage over him as he over his two
recent rivals. As a matter of fact, Harry Evans
was always spoken of at home as an all-round
player; and, with “spotstroke barred,” there is no
man in the world who can give him many points.
Yet, last week, meeting players less experienced
in the once all-important branch of the game, he
allowed them to play “ all round ” while he con-
fined his attentions to putting down the red ball.
Such is the art of billiards. By the way, the Mel-
bourne D.T., in speaking of tbe hero of the hour,
informed its readers that “although Evans hails
from South Australia, it is understood he learned
his billiards in England.” Considering that he is a
“ new chum,” who before he came out here had
reached a time of life when a man doesn’t improve
his game much, this is really funny, even for a
religious organ.
The note of preparation for the coining
boat-racing season has sounded. The Double Bay
amateurs open the ball on Saturday, 1st November,
with a big afternoon’s sport, ana the Bal maniacs
follow with their great carnival on the 10th. As
there are several new boats in the smaller classes,
and most of the old favourites are getting on their
war-paint, some fun may be expected. Regarding
yachting prospects, since the importation of the
lolanthe and the launching of the Sirocco, nothing
new has been added to the local register. In the
largest class, it is just possible that there may be a
meeting between those old antagonists, the Magic
and the Mistral, and with the Waitanga and pro-
bably the Orthona to join in on their time allow-
ance, something like a revival may be looked for.
Under fifteen tons, the names forthcoming are
few. Sirocco will be raced as hard as ever.
Why have wq not a few more such owners ? But,
where are the others ? Guinevere is in the mar-
ket, and a doubtful starter. There appears no
chance of the Violet flying a racing flag—at any
rate, while in present hands. Harpy is now em-
phatically a cruiser. The Daphne is for sale, and
her racing days are over. The owner of the
Pleiades is in England, and she won’t be sent in his
absence. The Meteor, an unlikely starter; land so
on. So that things look blue in this direction.
Under seven tons, the constant lone, in a new suit;
the Sao, the perennial Beaky, with her new owner
up ; and the Doris, time-ownered by our genial
friend in the neat uniform, will most probably
furnish the dish (unless. Indeed, “ Selvageo ” takes
it into his head to bring up tbe rear with that
noted clipper, the Bandicoot). If to this list the
lolanthe could be added, there would be some-
thing worth going to see. But her owner doesn’t
race her—more’s the pity. Of course, every man
has a right to please himself; but all lovers of the
sport regret the absence from our too meagre list
of racing craft of what many good judges con-
sider the fastest boat of her class in Australian
waters.
Bathurst is the graveyard of sport of all
descriptions. Amongst the “perfesh,” it is an
axiom of faith that a two nights’ show up there is
equal to one insolvency; and it is also said that the
potter’s field of the City of the Plains is chock-
full ol the mangled corpses of enterprising but
foolish men, who have been brutally murdered for
rashly attempting to get up a good day’s athletic
sports or horse-racing. As a sample of how the
game is killed, we may mention that about two
months ago a respectable citizen applied for
permission to hold a day’s fun in the en-
closure on the 10th of November, 1884. He
was politely informed that the committee then in
office were steeped to their ears in sorrow because
they could do nothing until the general meeting,
when a new committee would be formed, and, no
doubt, would have the greatest pleasure in acced-
ing to his mild request. Strange to say, however,
this self-same utterly powerless committee
granted an application made by the football club
to hold a kicking shivoo on Sept. 20—long before
the expected general meeting of the cricket
ground committee was held. Waiting patiently
until the conclave had sat, the sporting citizen
again applied, and was .informed by the
newly-elected secretary that he could not
have the grounds, as the previous secre-
tary (who deplored he “could do nothing”)
had arranged to hold a cricket match on
the same date. The Bathurst Cricket Club
has been “stone-broke” for some time past; the
cricket ground belongs to the public, and yet,
sooner than accept this citizen s tendered five
guineas, the committee prefer to occupy It by a
day’s leather-hunting which will not turn in five
shillings. Then, again, loud complaints are made
that at the recent Geranium Club races held in
Bathurst, persons in good circumstances were
found “ fishy ” enough to slip in on the tickets of
their able-bodied relations, the said relations
having secured an entry for themselves on the
plea of having accidentally left their pasteboards
at home on the “ grand peeanur.” What Bathurst
wants is twenty or thirty first-class funerals
amongst the ranks of its geebung aristocracy.
A writer in Vanity Fair, under the head-
ing of “ Sport,” gives the following account of an
ordinary battue:—Take this as a specimen of a five
days’shoot: “ The beaters got into line, and the
battue began. What a turmoil ensued I The beaters
shouted and yelled, and one long unceasing fusil-
lade filed the wood with its deafening roar. Phea-
sant after pheasant rose in quick succession from
the corner near which I stood. The golden youth
near me was busy. He had three guns and two
loaders, the latter hard at their work of loading
unloading, and handing the guns to their master
Down came the pheasants in showers, their bright,
glorious plumage mixed up in quivering heaps in
their dying struggles. Many fell with only broken
limbs or shattered legs; I saw them crawling
around me. I counted eleven at one time swim-
ming about in a littte lake hard by, into which
they had fallen. Then came the hares. Here,
there, and everywhere, I saw them running,
terror-stricken and confused. To escape was im-
POBflible; the netting prevented that. Many were
shot through the lions or otherwise maimed, and
crawled about screaming and in helpless misery.
The sporting Lord referred to had over forty of
these wretched creatures around. Very few of
them were dead, most of them dragging themselves
along by their fore feet, their ears back, their
eyes distended. Rabbits found themselves in a
similar plight. One poor hare came dashing into
the net close to where I stood, and became inex-
tricably Involved. He had not been shot at. ‘Poor
brute, I will save your life if I can,’ I said, and
tried to unwind him. Inexperienced, I bungled
over the task; and when at length I succeeded in
extricating it, the animal was dead. Fright had
killed the poor boast, whose timid nature is thus
tortured by man. And so the battue went on. In
course of time the massacre came to an end, the
beaters arrived on the scene, and with their sticks
and hob-nailed boots put an end to the struggling,
quivering, dying beasts around. Several amongst
them were carrying animals still living, which
they had picked up and had not troubled to kill.”
Woman Items
Aged widower: “If I could make up my
mind to marry again, I would take a young wife
that would love me as long as she lives.” Candid
friend: “You may be thankful if you get one
that will love you as long as you live.”
A fashion-paper tells us that perpendicular
striped stockings will be much worn shortly. How
a stocking, striped or otherwise, can be perpendi-
cular when its proprietress is lying at ease on a
sofa, or saying her prayers, as a good girl should,
is a problem that worries us.
A German Prince, on visiting a small town
in his dominions, was received at the gate by twenty
young damsels in white. The ten prettiest maidens
had been placed in the front rank, and the ten plain
ones in the second. Charmed with the display, the
Prince, whose three-score years sat lightly upon
him, kissed every one in the front rank on their
beautiful foreheads, and then, with great presence
of mind, beckoning to his adjutant, exclaimed,
“Sparrenholz, here, go on with the rest.”
Thus savagely a Radical print:—“The
English matron is sometimes political, and is then
a degree more pernicious than when on the war-
nath, trying to marry off her numerous daugh-
ters. When a woman meddles with politics she
becomes at once a person to be avoided. Political
women were a fearful pest during the ‘Jingo’
period, and they seem to be cropping up again in
defence of the Peers. This is troublesome, but
perfectly natural. Every Englishwoman, not a
nlue-stocking, is a Torv full of Queen-worship,
Prince-worship, and Lord-worship. Parsons’
wives are perhaps the most ‘ intense ’ in all this
snobbishness, but the wives of the nouveaux riches
run them very close.”
EQUIVOCATION.
We lingered, in the act to part,
The last word still unspoken,
By the quick beating of my heart
The silence faintly broken.
So beautiful she seemed and pure—
Ah, me I how I should miss her.
Unable longer to endure
My wish, I asked to kiss her.
A blush of deepest rose o’erspread
Her face, as if to mask it,
As, with a woman’s heart, she said
“ Why, Frank, you should not ask it! ”
The American papers are wroth at re-
marks made by English prints as to the growth of
the Transatlantic “ chloral fiend.” Thus the N. Y.
Sun:— “The average Englishwoman, with her
enormous consumption of porter, ale, and sherry,
and her mixture or bromide and sal-volatile always
at hand, takes more in the way of stimulant and
sedative In a month than her American sister in
the course of her whole life.”
A poet says: “ The beauty of her hair be-
wilders me—pouring adown the brow its cloven
tide, swirling about the ears of either side, and
falling around her neck tumultuously.” Very
poetical, that; but after he is married and sees her
hair swirling adown the chair-back on either side,
or pouring its cloven tide over one end of the
dressing table, or falling around the bed-post
tumultuously, the probabilities are that his
present bewilderment will be 00 per cent, more be-
wildering. He will be paralysed.
According to the legend, Egmhard paid
visits to the Princess Emma, daughter of Charle-
magne, after dark, while the snow lay thick on
the ground; but as he might have been detected
by his foot-prints in the snow, the courageous
young lady used to meet him at the garden gate,
carry him to her abode in her strong arms, and
then back again by-and-by. A spy reported her to
the emperor, who summoned his twelve peers to
decide what should be done with the young man
who had used his king’s daughter as a beast or
burden. Eleven of the peers showed sycophantic
souls by making horrid proposals for torturing
poor Eginhard, but Roland, the bravest of the
brave, said simply, “ Let them be married; ana
Charlemagne, with a laugh, exclaimed: I thina,
Boland, thou has named the best punishment alter
all.” _

Royal. It attracted an immense crowd, and a
very liberal prize list was made up for the various
kinds of babies. There were eight pairs of twins,
upon whom the Auckland bachelors gazed with
more interest and wonder than on any other ex-
hibits. There seemed to be something about them
they could not understand. The judges awarded
the first prize—a pair of vases, also twins—to the
Misses Higgins, five months old. They were
named Maud and Nellie, and alleged to be both
the same age. For the best all round baby, there
was a grand struggle, and finally Master Thomas
Cuthbert and Miss Lottie Pinnerty tied for first
place. They were both large and soft babies, with
full-moon laces and double chins, and had ex-
tremely fat limbs-at least. Thomas had. Both
had travelled along the milky way of existence
for just seven months. On being weighed they
were equal at 26hjlb., but an observant
mother noticing that Lottie had her shoes on,
Thomas was declared winner by a quarter of a
pound. Lottie, however, who then began to cry,
was pacified on learning that she was winner ot
the special prize given for beauty, apart from
more substance. When she gets about 1, years
older, MissFinnerty won’t care about being valued
by weight. The youngest and prettiest baby in
the exhibition was born, very appropriately, at
Mount Eden. The lightest mother’s-blessing was
iMlb. at six months old, and the heaviest at three
and a-half months sent the scale down flop at
331b. 3 oz. To the heaviest child under three
months old, a christening cake of guaranteed in-
digestibility was awarded. For a prize for the
prettiest baby born in Auckland, there were four
competitors: for prettiest Irish baby, twelve Mile-
sian mothers presented their productions; while
for the prettiest Scotch baby, five compated-but,
as the prize was given to a boy suspiciously named
Kelly, it is probable that a protest would be
entered, and Master Kelly be called upon to prove
his identity. Baby MTntyre gained a work-box
for having the curliest hair; Ethel Thomas was
adjudged the prettiest dark-eyed baby. There
was a prize for smallest baby, gained by one of
twins. The baby with reddest hair did not get
anything for himself, but his mother was pre-
sented with a cosey, and his father was authorised
to go to the nearest tailor’s and get a pair ot what s
their-names made to order. To make up, how-
fever, for this apparent injustice to the copper-
topped infant, another prize was awarded for no
personal merit at all, but simply to the child who
could lament having most brothers and sisters.
Hopeful and fruitful parents, however, were dis-
mayed by au annou ’cement from the stag© that
‘•clutches” of less than a dozen had no chance,
and eventually, amid general consternation, the
prize was handed over to the last comer ot a
family, which—at latest advicei-numbera sixteen.
The prize for the plainest naby was awarded in a
rather furtive kind of fashion. No one of the
judges was possessed of sufficient temerity to
declare her good fortune to the resolute-looking
mother; but at last one of them mustered up
courage to Inform her that her child had won a
handsome silver mug. The mother became
anxious to ascertain for what the prize had been
awarded. But, singular to relate, no one could tell
her.

In some respects they are much alike—
Longchamps and Plemlngton. The day of the
Grand Prix at Paris, like the day of the Melbourne
Cup, is the great dress show of the year—a show
of bonnets and beauty which, even more than the
dove of the horses tnennelves, draws thousands
to gaze on one another’s finery and
fashion. At Longchamps, the finest equipages are
seen- the toilets of the mondaines- and the demt-
mnndaines, too-the pretty faces of the noted
beauties, and the clouds of titled patricians, are
attractions on which the Frenchman is never tired
of gazing, and never will be so long as French
women know how to dress. Every beautiful face
and figure in Paris goes to the racecourse on Grand
Prix day, and the spectator comes away almost
cloyed with natural and artificial loveliness. Great
is the plotting to secure the services of Worth for
that day’s triumph, and fabulous are the prices
paid to that imperious oracle of fashion for his
masterpieces in muslin and his marvellous crea-
tioDS in crope. Hours have been fretted away in
his waiting-rooms and his little closets for trying-
on. But, if the day be fine, all the harass and
anxiety are repaid by the sweetness of a great
success. It is generally hot weather, but sunshine
does not hurt pretty dresses, and the eye is dazzled
by the wealth and glory of what Parisian women
show. The grand-stand of the Jockey Club is filled
with none but the hmt-monde. No beauty who
has crossed the boundaries of respectability is al-
lowed there, be she ever so fair. Bohemian belles
have no place on this exclusive stand. Cytherea
and Lesbla would be frozen with frowns if their
dainty feet only touched its ground. Yet they
have their place scarce a lew yards distant, and, to
tell truth, they come in for more attention, these
frail outsiders of the social Eden, than all the
noble duchesses and marquises who glance askant -
at them from their vantage seats. The ano-
nymas” recklessly display their superb flnery-
perhaps they feel a bitter satisfaction in flaunting
it They get it so easily. Their part of the stand
Is a very Kaleidoscope of colours;.and, curious to
sav the palest of pinks, the daintiest blues, the
purest of snow-whites have ever been in singular
favour with these certain ladies at Longchamps.
Thev come there in their artistic attire, their set
smiles, and their perfectly-appointed carriages,
and those who like to read their advertisement
may answer it. As a rule, Frenchmen of position
do not fetch Cytherea and Lesbia: though not
very particular, they have a code of their own.
Hut they cluster like bees around the vehicle when
It is drawn up in lino, they smile and exchange re-
nartee, and they send round champagne with brief
and well-understood messages. Very curious, it is,
too to watch the keen glances shot at these dubious
ladies from the pure and aristocratic stand, as one
and another scion of nobility threads t\is way
through the throng to Lesbia, to bandy phrases
with her. But when the prodigal returns, he is
met with smiles, and the duchesses and marquises
arc not above asking questions about the Lesbias
■whom they hate yet cannot eradicate. They would
not “ttheir hem touch one of Lesbia’s frills; but
thev will talk her over among themselves, and
hasten to discuss her charms, her sayings, doings,
stvle and number ahJ name of her lovers, with
the males of their own sot. Indeed, they rather
pride themselves on being well posted up in the
doings of these stars of “the half-world;’ and
they conscientiously copy their bonnets, bodices,
and dressing of hair. And the Parisian ladies dote
on a serving-maid who has been Abigail to Lesbia
or Cytherea, and is wickedly wise in the ways of
her toilet. Of course, there is nothing of this sort
at Melbourne. It is only in that naughty Paris.

It was at a recent fashionable ball, and
the ma«h having reached a certain stage, he gently
suggested a seat in a dim corner. “ Don’t you,
Agouistt," observed her sharp-eared sister; hell
klsiyou.” He protested it was an act he could
never dream of, but added carelessly, “ Supposing
I did what would you do, Mies Agonisa?” And
the dear girl s cheeks had a nice healthy glow as
she gently murmured, “ I—I should not scream,
Ch irlie.”
* * *
The Eureka Ball occurred on the 2ist, and
was a joyful affair, like previous ones. To judge
by the exuberant spirits of some of the young
g°nt!e nen, they were filled with more gladnessanrt
loy than they could conve dently hold. They quite
puobted over with bliss They aU knew one an-
other, and how to dance, so it’s not surprising if a
g iy and airy freedom took the place of that dull-
ness which sometimes hovers over the souls of
young people when they are the least bit afraid ot
one another. All the Eurekas are young, and so
satisfied with each other’s style of dancing that if
we had not been wal ked round by an extremely
engaging and affable young man, we might not
have been able to edge on to a programme at all.
He looked after us as carefully as a brother
—or a bailiff—every spare moment Inquiring
whether we wanted a partner, or felt thirsty,
and could do a cigar, asking deferentially it
we considered the dresses pretty, or it we
expected the rain would hold off till the morning.
One young lady in a fancy dress of scarlet and
black took the name of the ball as her character,
only the dear creature spelled it “ Eureca. But
we always notice it is the plain girls that spell well
—the angelic ones are never particular about a
letter or two. Another character was Vaude-
ville,” of cerise and black, rather nicely got up by
Miss Ross; and an equestrienne was in green and
white. A vivacious School-girl came in blue from
Strawberry Hills; and Misses Andrews and Long
were Follies. A married lady made a most charm-
ing Colleen Bawn, and her sister-in-law a light-
footed Sailor. Two fancy dresses, though not
showy, were particularly neat and nice: one was
Miss Murray’s Patience, milkmaid’s hat trimmed
with popples and wheat that wandered bewitch-
ingiy all over her partner’s cheeks—the other was
Miss McDonald’s sailor costume of short navy-blue
satin with white laced front and the bodice filled in
with white lace; hose, shoes, and hat to match.
Miss A. Service was a dainty girl as Cards in scarlet
und black, Miss Harman a Scotch Girl dressed in
harmany with the name, and Miss O'Brien like-
wise wore a pretty and attractive dress with a
gay military aspect. A lively Ultimo girl, who
could whirl round quicker than a gust of wind,
and just as lightly, wore a simple evening dress of
white, with plenty of spring in it —the tulle
drapery dotted with Huffs of down, and even the
other girls admitted It was pretty. Miss Adams
-was adams-el of considerable attraction lu crimson
and cream, and quite good-looking enough to
iaave taken Eve’s na i*e instead of Adam s. But it
I s our pleasing duty to record that a young lady
nailing under the foreign mme of Keegan, was
toelle of the ball. Partly because she was not too
gaily dressed, and partly because she had eyes like
grey stars. In addition to these good qualities,
this fascinating girl could skim the floor like a
swahow on the breeze. Mr. Charles Gee conducted
the orchestra with an ability we might fairly call
Gee-nius; while supper was well spread by Mr. G.
E. Edwards, of Glebe Point Road. Even under an
attack that threatened to leave any ordinary
tables as bare as the Barcoo in summer, this great
creator of tarts stood with a calm, superior smile,
that could only have resulted from full confidence
jn an oxhaustless supply of pastry and innumer-
able dishes of jelly shivering in reserve.

Having a fine public hall, and a popula-
tion of whom a large proportion are at that Inter-
esting age when it is desirable they should be
brought together, Carapbelltown determined to
istart assembly balls. It is late in the season, but
the preliminaries occupied longer than expected.
Eor one thing, a similar affair was projected at
•Camden, but it is alleged there are only four
•eligible young men in that prosperous place, and
the girls didn’t regard that number as sufficient to
(give them a fair chance. Then it was found that
on one night fixed, the local debating society
would be disturbed; and, as the late of the whole
country occasionally hangs on their deliberations,
the Campbelltown Gladstones Immediately met,
and asked one another In the sacred name
of liberty whether their rights were to be
thus trampled on. At last all things became
settled, and on Friday a number of the representa-
tive ladles and gentlemen of the district, with the
addition of Invited visitors, held their first assem-
bly with brilliant success. Various trains brought
visitors from Sydney and elsewhere, and buggies
and sociables brought others from all round. The
night was calm, bright, and deliciously cool, es-
pecially in the supper annexe, which was a canvas
framework along the outside of the hall, with
plenty of seats. Mr. and Mrs. Fisher and assistants
provided an exhaustless supply of delicacies from
the opening of the ball till half-past four, when
“ God Save the Queen ” brought it to an end. They
were civil, and their contract was thoroughly well
carried out. Wines were from Bschol Park. Card
tables did not find many patrons; the floor was
good, and also the music sent from town. The
entire building was adorned with ferns, willows,
and geraniums, twisted In loops and wreaths and
long garlands; flowers were profuse everywhere,
and the whole arrangement bespoke taste, and the
touch of ladies’ hands. One of the secretaries, Mr.
W. L. Moore, was unable to attend, but Mr. J. Laing,
assisted by Mr. J. Davies and Mr. Booking, received
guests, and took great pains to see to their comfort.
Mr. C. Bull, ex-Mayor of Campbelltown, volun-
tarily took the duties of M.C., and managed to
bring in a few extras, to the girls’ great glee,
which filled time till the mail train came through.
Many visitors stopped with friends in the town,
and Mrs. John Davies had quite a houseful of
guests. Liverpool was represented by Mr. and
Mrs. C. Bull and Mr. and Mrs. Varney Parkes, and
of the local district were Mr. and Mrs. Davies, Mrs.
A. L. Park, Mrs. E. H. Woodhouse, Miss Wood-
house of Marlesford, Messrs. P. B. Hurley, John
Kidd, J. Payten, &c. Of the principal figures on
the floor, Mrs. Jobson wore one of the prettiest
dresses, a well-made pink silk, hung with line net,
and looking admirable; Miss Wilshire, of Ashfleld,
a rich crushed strawberry edged with blue, and
pale-yellow skirt; Miss Thompson, a neat black of
light texture. In contrast to he fairness; Mrs. M.
Vardy, a neat pink; Miss Britten, of Harrington
Park, blue silk and flowered flounces; Mss Mackel,
rom the Post Office, was a winning little brunette
n pale pink. Miss Booking wore a model of
liry niceness, white tarletan touched off with
pink and ruched pink edging. Miss Margaretta
Oavies, an accomplished dancer, wore rich cream
broche and lace, Miss Martha pink, and Miss Cora
blue. Miss Chippendal), of Bradbury House, wore
a dress of pleasing style, the bodice being of pink
satin, and the skirt, with a few tucks at the bottom
and made to fall straight, being of delicate medusa
green. Miss Hosklsson wore a costly blue silk,
and Miss Amelia an ivory silk. Miss Clarke, In
white satin with blue tasselled tabs of broche,
danced in a way that was the acme of ease and
grace. Miss Kiss wore a pretty combination of
pink and white; Miss Pearce, of Balmain, a cream
Klltod dress ; Miss Bayliss a rich burgundy broche
and white lace front; Miss Godfrey a simple white,
charmingly suitable; Miss Lillie an ivory satin,
and Miss McCoy the same—both capitally effective.
Miss Payten, a dark-haired handsome girl from
Goulburn, wore a dress of light blue trimmed
with dark blue, and was a leading attraction of
the room. The local beauties were very effective;
and notwithstanding the winning maidens who
were visitors for the night, the title of honour,
generally given to the lady at a ball pre-eminent
for charms, was not won away from the district; —
Now, perhaps you will ask
Us to tell you the belle—an
Embarrassing task!
But she came from Narellan.
A face on the plan
That is known as the Grecian,
Such beauty as man
Isn’t safe unless he shun.
As fair as a dream,
(0, her accents ran glib on I)
Apparelled in cream.
With a dash of blue ribbon.
A butterfly tread,
And as tireless as merry.
And a droop of her head
That was lily-like, very.
Oh I it grieves us to say.
That we very soon fell an
Unfortunate prey
To that girl from Narellan.

At Qreenoakes, Darling Point, a show and
sale of flowers was held on Friday and Saturday,
in aid of a church at Moruya. Judging by attend-
ance, the general public did not seem to care
whether the benighted inhabitants of Moruya
have a church or not. In fact, the flower-show
met with rather slim support—the few who went
there were nicely dressed and estimable people,
but most of them residents of that lovely locality
who already have heaps more flowers than they
know what to do with. A band discoursed music,
cake, ices, &o., were vended in a mpquee; and tbe
flowers for sale were displayed in a large tent,
which was very gay to look at, but very warm
stay In for long. A tew folks strolled r® u ®fl
trim lawns and rustic walks of the Green-
cakes grounds, admired the cool nooks where art
has aided nature, and gazed on the entrancing
panorama of the harbour view; but the only really
interesting thing was the conduct of a respectable
looking grey horse who was not pleased with toe
way the band played and consequently kicked a
buggy to pieces out of sheer dissatisfaction.

On Monday, at the Masonic Hall, Parra-
matta, the close of the dancing season was signal-
ised by Mr, Alfred Read’s ball. It created a good
deal of local Interest, besides attracting a carriage
full of visitors from town, and fancy dresses
enhanced the gaiety of the occasion. Oh® „
item was the polonaise march, consisting or a
number of graceful evolutions to march time, and
terminating by all sliding off into the ever-
favourite waltz. Altogether, 32 dances occupied
till well on In the morning, and the weather being
warm, the cool porch lit with coloured globes and
the festive supper room were very welcome
during the intervals. Although demoiselles were
in the largest proportion, they by no means mono-
polised attention. Mrs. Crewe was most prettily
engaging in a fluttering dress of white, livened
with leaves of vivid scarlet; and her sister, also
in white, decked her skirts with variegated
butterflies, with tasteful effect. Another sister
took the character of that wilful little witch.
Cigarette. Continuing the Parramatta list, a
charming little maid from over the way, Miss lie-
vine, blushingly enjoyed her first ball as a Sailor
Lassie; a gentle girl from Church-street looked
captivating in white cashmere trimmed with silk,
and Miss French was an artless Shepherdess, as
gay as colours could make her—but Instead of fol-
lowing the sheep, they followed her. A Cyclist
looked very neat, land, in fact, both he and the
looked more suitably and coolly attired
than any one in the room; except, perhaps, a
dazzling dancer who was labelled Romp, line
glance at her skirt would convince anyone she was
determined to be cool. Then there was a King,
gorgeous as to his tunic, but when one looked at
tils legs, oh. as the ghost says in Hamlet, what
a falling-off was there.” Never was the dig-
nity of a king dependent on such poor sup-
port. A claret satin, with apron front of
rows of white lace, was very handsome and
so was a pure white satin dress, with train, and
trimmings of rosewood velvet. The costume of a
fair lady—white satin and black velvet—was also
excellent. Miss Johnson was a pretty blonde in
cream veiling pleated, and adorned with pale-pink
roses; and Miss Wilkinson, a dancer to dream of.
A lovely flower came from a Fairfield nursery,
chatty and cheery, with a Red Riding-hood cloak.
Two laughters of a city alderman, from Wllllarn-
street—one in a golden amber satin fitted up with
pale-blue; her sister In white veiling edged with
purple velvet —both looked handsome and viva-
cious. The ball was certainly enjoyable, and Mr.
Read will close his Richmond classes on Friday
with a similar dance.

At Wollongong, the Harmony Band gave
a ball in the Temperance Hall, and, skimmlmr
over the Argus man’s account, we rather like it.
He loves the dress the belle was in, not because it
was costly, nor for its fashion, hut because it
suited her most.” It was snowy India muslin on a
graceful form, with one solitary gleam of satin
round the waist-and what more could you want 7

The number of male dancers is steadily
decreasing in Paris. In oonsequenoe of this
anovel kind of register office has been started,
where young men can be obtained at a mo-
ment’s notice to fill up an unexpMted gap.

The members of the Balmain Rowing Club
are to be congratulated on their successful concert
last Friday night. The club being popular, and the
ladies and gentlemen who graced the stage being
well known and popular also, doubtless contri-
buted to the eclat of the proceedings. Sydney
pleasure-seekers are known to have a weakness
for socialities of the “Invitation order, but it is
rare to see a room so well filled as on this occasion,
when it was “the sweet privilege of youth to
pay.” Mr. Percy Jones, to whom the organising
of the entertainment was confided, was happy in
the selection of his supporters, for they all gave
satisfaction to the elite of Balmain; whom
(according to the ticket) wo reverentially expected
to see. And so we did, for they mustered
in strong force to give a bumper to the boys.
Madame Marius sung Levy’s Esmeralda and
“The old Look” very pleasantly. “Les Vespres
Siclliennes ” and “ La Naranjera/’ contributed by
Signora Fabrls, were well received by the elite,
who, doubtless, had the advantage of us in under-
standing all that liquid language. One of the most
agreeable contributions of the evening was Liszt s
transcription of the “ Marche Tannhauser, ex-
quisitely played by Mrs. Percy Jones, on whose
willing fingers, by the way, fell the brunt of the
accompaniments. M. de willimoff gave an artistic
rendering of Wienawaky’s “ Legende, and, in the
second part, a cavatina |by Raff, both of which
were deservedly well received. Mr. Percy Jon® 8
sang “Alla Stella Confident? ” with M. de Wil-
limoff’s assistance in the violin obligato, and Mrs.
Jones, as usual, at the piano. This number was
tunefully given, arid elicited an encore, to which
Mr. Jones responded with a well-known song
from “ Victorine,” which brought the evening to
a close.

Lady Augustus Loftus gave her first
Garden Party this season on Saturday afternoon
last, in the grounds of Government House. There
were not so many guests as usual on former occa-
sions, probably owing to the Flower Show at
Greenoakes taking place at the same time. And
also to the fact that a number of the habitues had
departed to Melbourne for the races. Among
those present, some elegant toilettes were very
noticeable—light colours, such as fawns and greys,
predominating. Lady Augustus wore a handsome
black broche, tastefully ornamented with beads,
Lady Hay, also black; Lady Allen, black silk and
stamped velvet; Mrs. E. Barton, the Speaker s
wife, a beautiful short silk, lace flounces, and car-
dinal ribbons; Mrs. Barry wore a quiet black
dress; Mrs. Clarke, dtirk green silk; Mrs. Paul, a
delicate dove-coloumd satin; Mrs. Airev, black;
Mrs. S. Burdekin, ore>am and blue; Miss Constable
appeared in smoke-grey cloth and broche; Miss
Moore, in a neat check; Miss Allen, in cream; Miss
Halloran was attirod in a light cream dress; Miss
Q. Eagar, in fawn cashmere ; Miss L. Burdett
Smith affected cream and lace; and Miss Stretton
looked well in dark blue. Another of these very
agreeable re-unions is to be held on Saturday,
November 16th.

A cheery ball last Friday was that which
closed the winter socials held in Warwick Hall,
Newtown. The return one, however, was held in
bt. George’s Hall, where were found good floor,
music, and supper. Two sisters from Krskinyille,
one in blue and cardinal and one in pale pink and
silver, won many admirers. A pratty girl from

King-street wore cream and cardinal ribbons; two
Camperdown sisters were bewitching In pink and
cardinal. Three sisters from Glebe, two In white
and one In blue, danced most charmingly; and a
Darlington blonde looked nice In pale pink,
draped with blue. Simmons-street sent a fair
damsel In black satin and grenadine, and a pretty
combination of cream veiling and silk came from
’King-street. Thanks were proposed to the presi-
dent and secretary (a married lady and her
daughter from Frskinvllle), and the medley dance
was finished by 2.30 a.m., when a move was made

Mt dear Bell®,— One day last week we re-
ceived irom Bands’ most unique cards of invita-
tion to attend the opening - or their new picture
gallery. They (the cards) were, I believe, designed
by “ Hop.” and engraved by the Photo-engraving
Company, 24 Pitt-street. well, wo went, and we
saw the gallery, and, as we were fortunate enough
to be near the walls, we ;saw some pictures too
but even then we were squeezed so close that In
made us squint, which ;gave the pictures no
chance. But I heard everybody say (and everybody
could not be mistaken, could ;they, 'dear ?) that
most of the pictures were very fine. After several
futile attempts to have a look,round, we had to
content ourselves with talking to our friends and
listening to the music. The chief topics of con-
versation were the heat (and it was hot up in that
gallery) and, of course, the iplotures. •* Had w
seen Mr. Ashton’s new picture? No? Oh I you
must see that. There It Is, hanging right in from;
ol you -best position In the room.” We looked
but I only saw the back of a lady’s head adornec
with a brown straw hat with amber feathers-a
pretty enough picture to be sure, but that wasn’;
Mr, Afhton’s, for it wasn’t hanging. It mover
away In .time (tbo thrown ;hat and ;feathors), ant
then we thought we should see the picture at last
but at that “moment a bald-headed gentleman
who was evidently on the same “lay,” clalraec
the space, so we got impatient and gave it up
How, we could have stood the hat and feathers
little longer, but the back of a bald head is so un
Interesting. Mons., de Willlmotf just saved us
from dying of heat and fatigue, for his Hungarian
dances made us forget all our sufferings. He Is
a pleasant performer, without being either
'viihelmj or a Remenyl. Mr. Fisher gave u« some
pianoforte selections, and played accompaniments
to ons. de Wllllmoffs violin. At a picture show

And really, when one thinks of the magnl-
cant costumes worn nt sports, regattas, and the
h» e >aud compares them with suph as were seen at
the Picture Gallery, it would seem that this gentle-
man was nearer the truth than hisses senerally
are In their remarks concerning us. Of course,
there were some costumes really nice on Saturday,
nut X speak of the majority when I say they were
‘"Appointing. Some day, when there is no chance
or there being a big pro>vd, I mean to go and have
a quiet look at these pictures, but I shall take a

There is a railway station at Rookwood.
There are many In N.8. Wales, but the Bookwood
one is running in cur mind just now for many
reasons. We shall give one only. Half a mile
from the station there is a valuable mine of—road-
metal. We never hear of road-metal but we think
of the time when Why call up again those sad
memories of the past? We will try and forget
them. Well, In a 10-acre block, half a mile from
the Rookwood Station, there is sufficient blue-
metal to macadamise the milky way. Smart men
have secured that paddock, and are about to turn
It Into “ The Rookwood Blue-Metal Quarrying

“ King Stephen was a worthy peer.
His breeches cost him but a crown;’*
and yet the ungrateful monarch was not contented,
for the song goes on to eay—
“ He deemed them sixpence all too dear,
And so he called the tailor lown.”
Still, it was not bad—four and-slxpence for a pair
ot nether garments; though, by the way, in those
days these necessary articles of apparel were only
half and-half sort of arrangements, just touching
the knee; and we may fairly assume that a n asher
of the period would have paid a trifle more for a
legitimate pair of continuations. Times alter,
fashions change, but the necessity for something
like the garments that King Stephen grumbled at
is still apparent to most of us. Like him, we don t
like to pay too much for our broadcloth and trim-
mings. We like something useful and not abso-
lutely out of the fashion, and we find that sort of

Political Points
In his Edinburgh speech, Mr. Gladstone
said he wished Germany Godspeed in colonisation
it she paid “due regard to the previous rights of
other nations and to the rights of the aboriginal
inhabitants.” A precious deal of regard wo Eng-
lish have paid to “the rights of the aborigines.”
The Limerick Corporation have received a
letter from the Lord Lieu tenant calling upon them
to levy a rate to pay for the extra police put into
their city under the Crimps Act, The Corporation
unanimously decline to comply with the order,
and will probably be sent to prison.
From Brough’s “ Songs of the Governing
classes
“ My Lord Tomnoddy is thirty-four;
The Earl can last but a few years more.
My Lord in the Peers will take his place.
Her Majesty’s Councils his words will grace,
Office he’ll hold, and patronage sway.
Fortunes and lives he will vote away,
And what are his qualllioations ? One I
He’s the Earl of Fltzdotterel’s eldest son.”
The Khartoum expedition has a tough job
before it. The Mahdi may “clear” on its ap-
proach, and re-appear, stronger that ever, as soon
as it has left. But, should he give battle, our ex-
pedition may be too weak for the hordes of the
False Prophet. The British have not this time to
deal with mere savages and clubs. The Madhi's
troops are formed of the remnant of Zobehr s
mighty slave armies, who are splendid rifle shots,
of the Kababish, and other of the most warlike
and powerful tribes of the Soudan, all well armed,
and whose leaders fight on their own ground
They have plenty of artillery, arms, and ammu-
nition, and are trained by numerous Arabist
officers now in the Mahdl’s service, many of whom
were educated at St. Cyr, the French Military
College.
From the Watchman, a Wicklow paper
which deplores the mildness of the tactics em-
ployed by the Nationalist party in the Commons:
—“Mr. Parnell seems to have resumed his place in
the ranks of the Wicklow landlords, and is, we are
glad to hear, grouse-shooting at Avondale. Only
why is not he denounced as a ‘ land thief 7 If his
ancestors—it is not far to count since the Parnells
came from Cheshire with the Cromwellian planters
—bought the lands confiscated from O’Tooles or
O’Byrnes, we do not for ourselves see ithat his
title is a whit better than that of his fellow-land-
lords, in many cases quite as good and more
generous ones than he is. Let us have one mea-
sure for all alike, and not the partial Sycophancy
of men who live and thrive on flattery as truly as
any base Roman of the days of Horace, who lied
for the crumbs from his Patron’s table.” Be-
gorraI
Thus a well-known English writer: “ It is
well known that an abominable traffic is counte*
■nanced in England, called the sale of benefices.
Really, it is a sale of souls. I pay ten thousand
pounds for a rectorship, and I can nominate as
pastor there, if I like, the Arch-Fiend himself.
Now, so long as this traffic, detestable as it 18, goes
on, I contend it should be open. If Lord Ducks
and Drakes can go and buy a fat living for his son,
why should not I, plain ‘ Northumbrian,’ be able
to go. If my conscience allows me, and do the
same? According, however, to the resolutions
reported by the Church Patronage Committee, one
effect of them, if they arc adopted by the Legis-
lature, will be that the power of acquiring private
patronage in the Established Church will become a
class privilege, open only to landed gentry. Now,
though no working man worth his salt would care
to go into the open market and buy a village full
of souls, this trifle shows the grab-and-grasp
policy of the upper orders clearly. Henceforth,
none but the usual privileged class, the land vul-
tures, are to be allowed to purchase Church pro-
perty. Thus, everywhere we see ourselves reso-
lutely kicked back. Let us act. Let the House of
Lords be abolished, and in any ten days’ work of a
reformed Parliament we should soon see who was
the master—work or idleness, the artlzan or the
aristocrat.”
Re the Foochow bombardment thus a home
paper:—“Whatsort of glory is it that men earn
by slaughtering 1000 to their own seven slain, by
Injuring 3000 to their own fourteen wounded ? Is
It war or butchery ? But horrible as are the details
of the French butchery at Foochow, it at once as-
sumes a comic aspect when we find our own Jingo
journals gravely lecturing Johnny Crapaud on his
conduct. Wo, at least, have our eyes too full of
beams to pull the motes out of the optics of our
brother. Unfortunately, Pharisaism is the besot-
ting vice of the age. We go about continuously
thanking Heaven that we ars not as other men.
When we bombard Alexandria, wo are noble bene-
factors of the Egyptians; when the French bom-
bard Foochow, they are bloodthirsty oppressors of
the Chinese. Our motives are always pure; the
of our neighbours are always selfish. The
worst of it is that we really believe it. It is to us
a marvellous thing to see a bald-headed old gentle-
man who goes to church on Sunday, loves his wife,
bis children, and his dogs, and steps aside to avoid
crushing a worm in his back garden, howling and
Shrieking for the foreigner’s blood upon the
slightest provocation.” In the same Journal are
two leaders. In one the woes of a four-weeks-old
baby are served up with a sauce of tears and
lamentation, and all that Is humane and tender
and pitif ul. In the other the same people who are
asked to weep over the sufferings of the month-
old victim ai-e urged to clamour and clamour, and
never cease clamouring until their rulers send out
an army to slaughter and burn and pillage and
make thousands of men and women and children
endure agonies by the side of which the sufferings
of the Birmingham Midget are the merest flea-
bites. If we go on receiving our instructions
from the same quarter the John Bull of the future
will be a counterpart of the double-faced gentle-
man in the pantomime—a smiling philanthropist
on one side, and a bloodthirsty ruffian on the
other.
In his recently-published book, “Notes
from Ireland. 1880, ,r Mr. W. Sime narrates a con-
versation with an Irish farmer:—Mr. Joyce, for so
the large farmer is called, gives his opinion freely.
“ Has he any fear of being shot?" “ None what-
ever; he never did any man harm.” “Did Lord
Mountmorres over the way do anybody harm ?
“ Well, not exactly; but he was peculiar; ho would
go about like a labouring man.” “ If he had been
a noisy, swearing lord, who never went among the
people except with an oath and his hand up, how
then ?” “ He would not have been shot.” “ W hy ? ’
“ Because they don't understand a man talking to
them in that civil way; they’ve never been accus-
tomed to it.” “ Then Captain Boycott, you think,
has taken the right way with them ?” To be
sure, though I think he has been high-handed
enough. I’ve driven home with him sometimes on
a market-day, and he never stopped his car for any
crowd of men. He would drive right through
them, and scatter them from side to side. He
wouldn’t accommodate himself to them.” How
might he have accommodated himself ?’’ “Well,
I’ve let my labourers away now and then for a
day or two at a time, and never asked where they
went.” “Even when it was inconvenient?” Yes.
“What do you suppose they were doing?’ ; ‘ I
have little doubt but that they were drilling
somewhere.” ‘‘Drilling?” “Yes; and there a
not a man of them In the country-side of Lough
Oorrlb or Lough Mask who can’t fall into position
as well as the regulars.” “ Who drills them.
“ God knows.” “ But you don’t think there’s any
general feeling of rebellion against England and
the Government ? ” To that Mr. Joyce declines to
answer, being as much in the dark as his ques-
tioner; but he adds that “he believes they don t
learn to do that for nothing.” “ Why do you
allow your labourers to go away when it is incon-
venient?” “The Land League.” “You are
afraid of it ? ” “ To be sure.” “ And even though
you think you will not be shot, you believe the
League may harm you through your people if you
do not oblige them whenever they choose to make
an unreasonable request?” “I know it would;
and 1 don’t know but what it will harm me,
whether or no. If they are going to drive us all
out, it may be my turn next; but I will oblige my
people as long as I can.” “ That is, you will sub-
mit quietly to whatever tyranny they subject you
to if the Land League dictates it ? ” “ Weil, I sup-
pose that’s what it is.”
Tbuth’s own Labby entertains the follow-
ing profoundly commonsensical views on “The
Question of the Hour”—the Peerage question; we
condense from his paper in the Fortnightly:—
“I can conceive that there would be certain ad-
vantages in an U pper Chamber composed of wise,
experienced, and independent men. Find them,
and then it will be time to discuss whether their
services can be utilised as the members of a sort
of Court of Appeal. One thing is certain, that the
House of Lords is not such an assembly. Let us
look into their independence by the unerring light
of statistics. The House of Lords, exclusive of
minors, consists of 507 members. They enjoy a
rental of £11,873,830 derived from 14,251.133 acres,
but in pay, pensions, &c., they receive £639,845
from the public exchequer. Since 1850, the 28
dukes and their families have received from the
taxpayers £9,760,000; the 33 marquises and their
families have had £8,303,950; and the 380 earls and
their families have had £48,181,303; 36 peers have
at the present moment salaries as members of the
present administration, and 190 have had salaries
as members of preceding ones—86 peers are Privy
Councillors, and 61 have decorations. The peers,
therefore, are not only a compact Jand wealthy
territorial oligarchy, but, notwithstanding their
enormous riches, they make use of the legislative
power which the constitution secures to them, in
order to obtain places of emolument for themselves
and their families, and to throw the cost of the
latter upon the State, whilst not satisfied even
with this, they insist upon honorary distinctions
being showered upon them with a lavish hand.
The average cost of an hereditary legislator since
1850 seems to have been £108,477, and the average
cost of a ducal legislator during this period has
been £348,571. How have they earned this money?
By opposing, mutilating, or rejecting every valu-
able Bill sent up to them. Every class except
their own, every sect except the Church of Eng-
land, has had reason to regret their existence. In-
dependent they are not; above class prejudice they
are not; wise they are not. Had they had their
wav. we should still have rotten boroughs and
rotten municipalities. Catholics, Nonconformists,
and Jews would still be outside the pale of the
nnnuHtiitlon The Irish farmer would still be
robbed of his improvements by his landlord, and
ground to the dust by the lords of the soil. Edu-
cational endowments would still be the appanage
Of H spot and the poor would be without educa-
tion It one man is more separated than another
from the mass of the nation, it is a large land-
owner protected by an entail from the accidents of
lor tune and worshiped from his cradle by the
vulVar An hereditary Upper House, whose mem-
bers are drawn almost exclus vely from great
landowners, is the reductio ad absurdnm of states-
craft ln comparison with it, the superstition of
negro grovelling on the banks of the
bfock of wood, and believing it to be
nOod is wisdom. Since the death of Lord Palmer-
ston 86 new peers have been created. A few-a
very lew-have received peerages for services
rondprert to the State; some have obtained their
tit°es because they had been tried as Ministers and
found wanting; some because they had spent
large sums in electoral bribery; some because
were large-acred squires; one because he is a

anv other European State-has only one. With
us the fact that there are two Chambers is a
matter of hazard, and originated in Lords being
regarded as superior beings to Commoners. In
m.fnv countries our example has been followed,
hist m it woutd have been followed had it so hap-
pened that our Parliament had consisted of half a
Soren Chambers Instead of two. In Sweden there
were not long ago, four Chambers - Lords, Priests.
Peasants and Burghers; and when it was proposed
to Substitute two Chambers, just as much was
urged in favour of the wisdom of the existing cum-
bereome arrangement as is urged by your advo-
cates of two Chambers. As a matter of fact, in
everv country where there are two Chambers,
either one absolutely dominates the other, or
there are perpetual disputes between the two.
Be this however, as it may, it is an error to mix up
the Question of one or two Chambers with the
question of abolishing an Upper Chamoer, in
which the members are all wealthy landlords who
sit by hereditary descent. Equally a mistake is it
In Radlcah) te suggest for reforming the
House of Lords. To reform is to increase effi-

moreo’bjectlonable than one which is unreformed,
because it would be stronger.
that has been put forward Is to the Peers to
elect a certain number of their body to sit and
vote. But what should we gain by this ? Wnether
the Upper Chamber be composed of fl ve °r of five
hundred Peers, Is a matter of absolute unimport-
ance. We object to the privileges, which this
House collectively possesses, not to the numbers
who exercise these privileges. We are °PP° 8 ®41.9
rotten boroughs, because they are rotten. But what
rotten borough could foe worse than that a number
of gentlemen should have an hereditary tight to
select the members of one house of the legislature (
It is obvious that the easiest method of giving
practical expression’to the opinion that the House
of Lords should be extinguished, is to decline any
longer to vote £40,000 per annum for the expenses
connected with that assembly. There is _ no deubt
that the vast majority of Liberals are in favour or
abolition. They have only to give effect to tneir
views at the polling-booths to ensure their final
triumph. When the time comes for the audition
of the House of Loids, it will indeed be necessary
to make a great creation of peers in order to
swamp all opposition. Lord Salisbury is neither a
trimmer nor a time-server. He declines to he a
mere lay figure in the legislative assembly, which
is mainly composed of narrow-minded gentlemen
happy in being called “mylord,” in their social
supremacy, in their wealth, and in being permitted
occasionally to vote as they are ordered m a gor-
geous chamber. Such a chamber he regards as
utterly contemptible. We go a step further, and
regard it, not only as contemptible, but as banef ul.
He seeks to meet this state of things by a straight-
forward attempt to give it the reality of power: we
meet it equally straightforwardly by reiterating
the resolution passed by the Long Parliament, 1 he
House of Lords Is useless, dangerous, and ought
to be abolished.”

Mr. Gladstone advises the advocates of
Church Disestablishment in Scotland to make the
question a test at the poll, and he will abide by the
result.... One hundred new peers would have to be
created (or botched up, shall we say?) to outvote
the obstruct ive peers on the Franchise Bill, 1 rom
the present temper of the British public, it would
be much more likely Mr. Gladstone would propose
to make them that number less... .The French Mi-
nister of Marine now thinks that only convicts
of a superior class” should be sent to -New
Caledonia. It seems probable that In future
French Guiana will take four-fifths, and New Ca-
ledonia only one-fifth, of the French convicts....
Within the last 33 years, the dukes, earls, and mar-
auises of England, with their relatives, have
divided amongst them over £66,000,000 of public
money; while out of 509 peers, 438 Possess
one-fifth of the entire national soil
acres), yielding them a rental of £13,000,000 per
annum 1....The French journals are as full of
China as a modern lady’s boudoir. The Parisians
are more warlike than they have been at any time
since the fall of Sedan, and every man who sips
his cup of coffee on the boulevards cuts off an
imaginary pigtail with his spoon.
The remarkable immunity enjoyed by
drunkards from the consequences of falls has in-
duced a great traveller to write ; Never fall over
a precipice. But if you do hall get thoroughly
drunk ere you take the leap.’ Drunken men have
fallen200 feet without being killed. The reason
for this immunity is, according to the Book or
Health, that “ the nerve-centres, which regulate
the heart and vessels, are so much paralysed in
the drunken man as not to be affected by the
shock of the fall, which in a sober man would have
acted on them so violently as to stop the heart,
arrest the circulation, and cause instant death.”
Appetites are supposed to diminish with
civilisation. In “ Barrow’s Travels in South
Africa,” ten of the natives, in the writer’s
presence, ate an oX, all but the hind leg, in throe
days, and three Bosjesmen devoured a sheep in
less than 34 hours. On the other hand, it is related
of Dr. Fordyce, a London physician and lecturer
of the last century, that his one meal a day—he
took no more—consisted of fish or fowl with a
quarter of a pint of brandy, a pound and a half of
rump steak, with vegetables, and a quart of strong
ale. This was followed by a bottle of old port.
“ When the dinner was finished, as it invariably
was in an hour and a half, he went to meet his
class, and lecture on chemistry.”
Some maniac has given currency to the
rumour that Herbert Spencer’s works are to be
translated Into Chinese; and many papers have
copied the statement, as If it was rather a fine
piece of literary gossip. When it is remembered
that he is one of the profoundest reasoners on ab-
stract subjects of this or any age, and has been
compelled to construct a vocabulary of his own,
and that to grasp his system requires a capacity ot
long and sustained attention not possessed by one
in fifty of what are called educated Englishmen,
the absurdity of attempting to express his mean-
ing in a language made up almost wholly of sym-
bols of concrete things Is clear. Fancy a Chinese
equivalent for this heading to an Important section
of his pychology, “ The Relativity of Relational”
Bahl The Chow-chow of chopsticks.
“ I like to see my employes comfortable,
contented/ and, above all things, Independent,”
said the head of an extensive drapery establish-
ment In Jamberoo, when he was being banqueted
prior to his departure for a trip on the “Contl-
nong.” And as the festivities proceeded, one of
the independent employes, when responding to
something, casually remarked that early closing
wasn’t such a bad thing after all, and that the
general adoption of the system would tend even
to make himself and his fellow-employes more
comfortable, contented, and independent, yet his
speech was received with a coldness bordering on
frigidity. But when he was interviewed next day
by the manager and was Informed that as late
hours seemed to be prejudicial to his health and
that there happened to be other business places in
Jamberoo where early hours were rather the rule
than the exception, and that he (the Independent
was to a certain extent a free agent, he
began to discount the grandiloquent sentiments
of his chief, and he now reckons that it is all right
to be comfortable and contented, but he has to
stretch a point if he wants to be Independent.
A “Lover of the Sabbath ” has written a
most distressful letter to the Melbourne D.T. about
the way in which certain youthful Victorians
desecrate their Day of Beet. This poor gentle-
man, it appears, took a walk the other Sunday
along the verdant Yarra bank, when he discovered
a “black spot.” The peculiar blackness of this
spot is best described in the “ L. of the S.’s ” own
words: “ I beheld a sight I have never before seen
in this colony, though I have been in it for nearly
twenty-eight years. I came upon an enclosure,
which I found, upon reading a sign-board, to be a
tea-garden, said board notifying that ‘ tea and
colonial wines ’ could be obtained there. In this
garden were about forty or fifty young men, en-
gaged either in swing, see-sawing, or playing at
quoits. The place was a perfect Babel.” This is a
sad, sad story. We have often wept over desecra-
tions of the Sydney Sabbath, but we refuse to be-
lieve that the most lawless spirits of this city have
yet sunk to such a depth of degradation as to “see-
saw ” on the Seventh Day. Yet, after all, it may
be that the “tea’’was the prime mover in these
orgies. All the wickedness lurking in the bosoms
of these young Melbourne fiends was stirred into
activity by the tea, perhaps. This will be a bitter
reflection for Booth.
Here’sanother touch of that Nature which
makes the whole world kin. According to the
last returns, there are now 12,128 Chinese in Vic-
toria, and of these 447 are members of the Church
of England, 18 are attached to the Presbyterian
denomination, 229 are Methodists, 5 are Baptists, 6
are Bible Christians, 1 is a Disciple of Christ, 122
are Roman Catholics, and 4 are Mahometans.
Here's where the touch comes in. At the taking
of the last census, 156 Chinamen objected to state
their particular style of religious belief, and, in
fact, positively refused to give it a name in any
shape or form whatever. As this happened to be
something unusual, Mr. Government Statist Hay-
ter directed the interpreters to worry round until
they discovered the cause of all this reticence, and
it then leaked out that the prudent objectors had
secretly seceded from their own Joss-houses and
worshipped on the quiet with the Christians, but
they objected to this being made public, because
they happened to be in business, and some of their
bigoted countrymen, “ alleesame Clistyans,” would
at once withdraw their custom if they knew their
cabbage-growers, general hucksters, and fan-tan
bankers had thrown over Confucius’s “ bulwark ”
and caught on to that of Britain. Religion is a
funny fad as it’s played to-day, no matter how or
where you take it.
An up-country editor was sick and has re-
covered. This, to the cynical mind, will appear
another calamity. To our mind, it is .subject for
profound Te Deum. He had written out a splen-
did account of a successful race meeting held in
the district. He had shown (which was the fact)
that the racing was superb, and the public de-
lighted. But, somehow or other, the account die
not satisfy. There was a void somewhere, ant
read it often as he would the void got voider. And
yet all horsey men said he was accurate in his par-
ticulars. Gloom settled on his soul, and, of course,
rum into his stomach. Even in his most drunken
hilarity, however, the dagger .would [float before
him. At last he got others to read the article, and
they complained of a vacuum, also. The township
was as if a pall spread over it. One night, sitting
moodily in the corner of the bar, he observed
another man sitting opposite, if possible, more
gloomy than himself. At last the stranger ap-
proached, and the editor recognised him as the
wreck of the racing secretary. “Would you
know,” asked the spectre, “ the hiatus that has
blasted your life, brought this community to un-
timely insanity, and made me a wild waif on the
drifting sands of time ? Hear it then,” he hissed
under his (breath, “ whdn you (wrote that article
you called me secretary, with fiendish malignity
you refrained from calling me indefatigable /” The
dream fled. Reconciliation. Hilarity. Cheerful-
ness.
A long correspondence is progressing in
the London Standard on the subject of what
that organ of the “hupper suckles ” emphatically
calls “Injudicious Patronage” in the Anglican
Church. Much of the church patronage is “ in-
judicious ” just as the crime of the burglar or the
horse thief is, to use a Sydneymornlngheraldism,
“improper.” For Instance, a poor clergyman
who has £100 a year and no house, is appointed by
a benevolent Dean to an office bringing In an
extra £60 a year. The Dean dies, whereupon the
chapter take away from him the latter appointment
and give it to one of their own number who
already has £300 a year as Vicar, £240 a year as
holder of another living, and a well-paid lecture-
ship—in all £650 apart from what is stolen from
the other man. Then it comes out that an
Archbishop and a Bishop desired very earn-
estly to serve respectively a great friend and
a near relation. If each prelate bad appointed his
own candidate, there would most probably have
been two local outcries against such jobs—one in
each diocese. But the difficulty was surmounted
in a way which could only have been thought of
by men who prayed regularly and got their
wisdom direct from heaven. The Archbishop
benevolently appointed the relation of the Bishop;
while the Bishop most generously, in return, ap-
pointed the friend of the Archbishop—a policy at
once clever, effective, and “judicious.” In both
cases the persons thus nominated had not served
one single day, either as curates or incumbents
in the diocese in which they received promotion.

it would have to be amputated to save my life.

me, in gratitude for which I make this public

The Heritage of Woe!
Misery, shame, and agony, often bequeathed as a
sole legacy to children by parents, is neglected
Scrofula. To cleanse the blood of this hereditary
poison, and thus remove the most prolific cause of
human suffering, to clear the skin of Disfiguring
Humors, Itching Tortures, Humiliating Eruptions,
and Loathsome Sores caused by it, to purify and
beautify the Skin, and restore the Hair, so that no
trace ot the disease remain, Cuticcba Hesoevemt,
the new Blood Purifier, and luticura and Cuti-
cuba Soap, the great Skin Cures and Beautlllers,
are Infallible. They are the only remedies that
succeed when physicians and all otherlmeans fail.

Crewkeme, Nov. 12, 1880.
Sir,—My patients have given
me a very satisfactory account
of Dr. Scott’s Electric Hair Brush.
One lady assures me that she gets no
neuralgia in her face if she uses it, and
others state that by a. few minutes’ brush-
ing with the Electric Brush, a nervous headache,
or one arising from overwork or debility, is quickly
removed. The invention is, I think, very valuable.
I am, your obedient servant, q. p. Wills, M.D., M.R. C.S.B
From Dr. Lemprirbb, D.O.L., Ac., St. John’s College, Oxford. Dec. 23, 1881.
Gentlemen, —I have known and appreciated the great advantages of your Electric Hair Brush for some time, and, as I find the benefits increasing,
I feel it my duty, as well as my pleasure, to earnestly recommend it. No oae who has not tried it can possibly imagine how material its comfort is,
Your Flesh Brush is only one more proof of the enormous future open to the scientific development of useful and beneficial domestic appliances. The
Brushes are indeed a wonder, and well worth the money. Yours faithfully, 0. Lbmpribrk, D.C.L., &c.

P.O. BOX 22!.
A correspondent of the World draws at-
tention to an application “ from * William Booth,
General of the Salvation Army and Minister of
the Gospel,’ to be registered as the proprietor of
a trade-mark, in which the designs ot a cross and
crown and the words * Blood and fire ’ form the
principal part. The application is for Classes 13,
Cutlery and edge tools ; 41, furniture and up-
holstery ; 48, perfumery (including toilet articles,
preparations for the teeth and hair, and perfumed
soap).” There’ll probably be a lot of “ Blood and
fire ” aboutlwhen anyone comes to shave with a
“Salvation razor” which the enterprising General
has sold him, in the name of Heaven, for half-a-
crown.
Seeing that the modesty of the Melbourne
“bobby” is proverbial, everyone will sympathise
with a certain active and “ intllligent ” young
officer of that city, who was recently placed in a
very painful position through the waywardness of
Margaret Pearce, a nymph of the Carlton pavi. To
be brief, then, Margaret was interviewed by the
“active” one m her humble home on the ridicul-
ous charge of seeking to tell the time by a Mr.
Wheeler's watch. She was annoyed at this, it
appears. Judging from the appalling story subse-
quently unfolded to the Bench, Margaret must
have been awfully displeased. “ She stripped off
every stitch of clothing and dared me to take her,”
said the blushing “ Robert ” to Mr. Call of the City
Court. And it will remain to the everlasting credit
of the force that their sorely-tepapted brotner did
not take such a delicious “ case ” without further
persuasion, but permitted her to “scream and
swear with nothing on” until such time as a female
relative had hidden sufficient of Margaret’s charms
to enable her to be “ run in ” in a cab.
A thrill of joy passed through the bosoms
of the honest farmers of the Goulburn Valley
(Vic.), when it became known that the “Vaga-
bond ” was about to electrify them with a rcchauffi
of his South Sea Islands experience, and let them
into the grim secret as to how the unsophisticated
natives of those southern islets served up baked
missionary on the half-shell, along with other
playful pastimes of those guileless children of
nature. Not altogether on that account, however,
was the travelled Julian so heartily welcomed as
for the fact that he was commissioned by the
Argus proprietors to write up “ Picturesque Vic-
toria,” whatever that may be; and even as a de-
crepit chicken aspires to be written up as an as-
piring and robust rooster, so does the average one-
horse community yearn to pose before the world
as an “ important centre,” “ the garden of Aus-
tralia,” “the future Chicago,” or something of
that sort. Weil, Julian went to Mooroopna,
sampled some of its liquors, took a cuisory view
of the hamlet through the bottom of a tumbler,
and then hied himself off Hhepharton, where he sat
himself down and gouged out a lengthy article on
tho village he had just left, describing its beauties
and general advantages in a left-handed compli-
mentary kind of way He came to gush, and left
only to scoff. Ho when the two-penny Thundsrcr
arrived from the metropolis, a few days after-
wards, and the Mooroopnians read therein that
their “ Important centre’’ was designated a slab-
sided, or a wall-eyed village, or something, they
fairly revelled in rum and profanity, and cursed
the veracious “Vag.” and his ancestors even
unto the seventh generation. And not content
with howling maledictions hot and strong at
tho writer, “ they held a public indignation
meeting to protest against the correctness of such
reports^’—we quote a local print—” and to consider
what action should be taken to refute them.”
Furthermore, it was loudly (and we might say
vehemently) expressed “ that we quote again—
“the Vagabond had been ‘ got at,”’ and motions
were carried to the effect that the article describ-
ing Mooroopna “ is nothing but a tissue of false-
hood,” and that “ the proprietors of the Argus,
Age, and Daily Telegraph be asked to send up
reporters to write an account of Mooroopna and
the surrounding district.” It is said that a blood-
thirsty Mooroopnian wont so far as to father a
resolution demanding the head of Julian on a
charger, but this requires confirmation. Julian,
however, continued his triumphal career through
the district, and finally we stumble across him
again at the flourishing little village of Nathalia,
where he visits the office of the local Herald, and
—but let the “ Vag.” tell how he started the rum
of that hitherto promising journal:—“I inscribe
my name on the walls of this pioneer newspaper-
office. and drink success to its endeavors (sic) to
enlighten the selectors of the neighbourhood.”
This was too much happiness for tho local editor;
but Julian had judiciously crossed the Murray at
Tocumwal ere the infuriated Beckett had sallied
out, with bis meat-axe in one hand and a copy of
the Argus in the other, to ask for an explanation.

FAMOUS
PIANO.
NEVER previously did any piano win such a hold
on the public as the Mignon has done since
its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
done their level best to rival us— blazoning forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous nourish
of trumpets. What result hare they to show,
excepting to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales of the Mignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies-in Victoria and New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the far north of Queens-
land ; in Now Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON
can be found, and its n
word.
e is really a household
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the people’s favourite.
THE MIGNON PIANO
for its size defies all would-be imitations.
THE MIGNON PIANO
guaranteed to withstand any climate in Australia.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the cheapest, because the best.
THE MIGNON PIANO
can be had Jon very easy TIME PAYMENT.
THE MIGNON PIANO
excels all similar pianos for firrt-class work and

AYER’S PILLS.

A large proportion of the diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange*
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes:
“Ayer’s Pills are invaluable tome, and
.are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing I could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain. They
are the most effective and the easiest physic
I have ever found. It is a pleasure to me to
speak in their praise, and I always do so
when occasion offers,
W.iL, Page, of W. L. Page & Bro.”
Franklin St., Richmond,Va., dune 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Fills in number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize them as a
§leasant. safe, and reliable family medicine.
'OR DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable.
J. T. Hayes.”
Mexia, Texas, Juno 17, 1882.
The Rev. Francis B. IIarlowe, writing
from Atlanta, Ga., says: “ For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I suffered increasing
inconvenience, until some months ago I
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, and
have vastly improved ray general health.”
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to the
whole physical economy.

MERCHANTS' MANCEUVRES AND TRADERS’
TRICKS.
in lightly touching on the tricks of trade,
Whence shall I draw sweet inspiration’s aid 7
Shall Lesbian Sappho be Invoked to pour
Her measures forth, as erst in days of yore 7
Shall Clio or shall Erato relate
What thiags are dene where merchants consre-
gate?
Or shall Thalia bid the stanzas flow
In praise of Bunkum, Blatherskite, and Co.?
No, surely not; this tuneful trio guides
The amorous strain, and over love presides:
Tells of the joys that spring from mutual troth,
And traces love’s insidious, glorious growth.
Her© I may own that Sappho’s melting song
Would now be deemed immoral, lewd, and wrong,
By Anderson, who straightway would arraign
The publishers of such a wicked strain.
And with quick prosecution intervene
To stop the sale of what hi deemed obscene;
With ready zeal display his eagerness
To act as self-made Censor of the Press.
But, once again, who shall inspire the line ?
Ah, Mercury! the theme is surely thine;
Patron of merchants, here thou dost bestow
Thy kindly help, and when received below
Dost guide them, if we trust to ’lully s page,
Where ever rolling fiery torrents rage.
The Latin wi iters also plainly tell
That Mercury was god of thieves «s well;
And from the combination it would seem
That Romans held not merchants in esteem,
The name of merchant, then, comos from the
French
Word michant, “ wicked,” (vide Dr. French)—
The extra letter being joined thereto
Because our ancestors, as playwrights do.
In stealing from the French, their gains disguised
Lest the words stolon should be recognised.
And this purloining of a foreign term
Is source of wealth to many a Sydney firm.
One man by skilful fraud his pockets fills
By making Holloway’s or Johnson’s pills;
Another firm, in avarice as great,
With home-grown cabbage-leaf will Imitate
The Cuban weed that’s held in such repute,
And m Its place such rubbish substitute;
A borrowed box, and label counterfeit
Afford a cover for the dark deceit—
And a good discount can be always earned
If empty boxes are intact returned.
Again, some recent law-suits can explain
How much of “ Fruit Salt,” stuffs so named con-
Andfrom the Herald’s interesting page
We learn the way they make this beverage:—
" Tartaric acid smashed up very flue,
With soda, also finely-crushed, combine;
Then Eno’S bottles, and his labels, too,
Prove ‘ Paris ’ to be French for-Jatnberoo.
(The meaning here Is murky, I confess.
But libel laws, just now, are merciless )
What large resources Sydney has displayed I
Here goods from every land and clime are made;
Does Lllty’s stream give Dublin porter fame 7
What’s that? why S street can make the
same;
And not alone the self-same well-known brew,
But with the Dublin brand, and capsules, tool
While B street discovers leady sale
For all it makes of Tennant’s bottled ale;
Then real Scotch whisky's made in C— —•—-
And*Buffland’s gin flows from the same retreal;
While real French brandy and Jamaica rum
From Waterloo on ponderous lorries come.
Such manufactures yield a welcome gain.
And it they fall, two mines of wealth remain;
To daring men a never-falling Held.
Which to the greatest rogues most profit yield.
The first, Insurance-erstwhile wisely-planned
To stay the stroke of tell disaster's hand;
But now abused by many, who contrive
From it a base-earned profit to derive.
Who has not noticed that when trade stagnates,
And banks announce a rise In discount rates,
And speculative dealings almost cease,
How quick the calls lor firemen s help increase?
If forage tabs, and credit feels the shook,
How quioaly flames consume the lingering stock 1
And thus a modern Phoenix is descried;
For when the all-devom Ing flames subside.
Although the goods have taken tiery wings,
Yet from their ashes double value springs.
And then the last resource-why should 1 dwell
On this device, which now is known so well ?
Why should 1 name the frauds that are employed
By those who go to Stephens or to Lloyd ;
No, ’t would bo tedious as a “ twice-told tale.
To toll the histories of those who fail.
One of the poet i has most truly said
Tnat men, on stepping stones of their selves dead,
Can rise to better things, and here his thought
Had surely reference to the Bankrupt Court.
But yet, while blaming some, the Muse can find
Praise lor tnose merchants of a nobler hind,
Whose minds, by rectitude and conscience swayed.
Confer an honour on the name of trade;
Watson and Ewan are among the band
Of merchants whom the Muse’s praise command;
Behold their kindness! each one gladly came
To Mason’s aid, and either lent his name
To guarantee ten thou., and for this aid
They only asked six thousand should be paid,
Great was their kindness, and we feel surprise
That lying tongues should dare to stigmatise
The worthy pair, and, with expression strong,
Condemn the fact as infamous and wrong.
’Tls but the breath of envy—who need care
For what such men, with bated breath, declare;
Watson shall flourish, let who will upbraid.
And pocket his six thousand-when ’tie paid.

when j ust,
And scorn had not swept o’er his sleepless nights.
But he would climb, with unwashed hands and
feet,
And features wrenched awry with base desires;
And rested not, until, where sunbeams meet
And flood the smooth white peaks with lire, he
stood,
And set his face among the great of soul,
Who shine more bright the brighter gleam the
fires.
And argued that, because he reached the goal,
He with the great and good was great and good,

Such extentive rioting has been provoked
by the proceedings of the Salvation Army in Eng-
land, that the authorities will ere long, probably
have to altogether interdict their proceedings.
Recently, at Frome, two “officers” were sent to
gaol In default of paying a fine Imposed on them
for blocking the streets. When they were released,
bills were issued:—“ Coming Home, Thursday,
August 38. Return of Captains Smith and Cozens
from their Seven Days’ Rest In Shepton Mallet
Gaol. Major Sowerby, twenty Blood and Eire
Officers, and a Host of Red Hot Soldiers, with
Brass Bauds, will give them a proper welcome
homo. Grand *Banquet at 5 p.m. Everybody
come. Monster Salvation Tournament at halt-
past 7. The boys from the gaol will wear the
prison costume, and relate their prison experience.
Come early.” After breakfast, the two ex-
prlsoners were arrayed in convict’s dress (canvas
suits with the broad arrow), and then the whole
party went for a picnic. In the evening, they
‘processed,” and there was a terrible riot, in
which all the “ Army ” flags were captured by the
mob. The bands suffered also, many of their in-
struments being battered out of all shape, and the
big drum was cut open. Then the mob sang
“Rule Britannia!”
The bluest blood of the Cabbage Garden
aristocracy is evidently on the boil, and some of the
first families down there are going it kt a pace cal-
culated to lead to trouble. The very latest sensa-
tion is an open secret which says that a second
edition of the notorious Beecher-Tllton scandai
will shortly be'trotted out and put through the
refining process peculiar to tho Melbourne Divorce
Court. Of course there’s a parson at tho bottom
of the racket, because now-adays a Divorce Court
scandal without a parson is like “ Hamlet with-
out the young Danish “ crank,” or a pump without
a sucker. What the sunshine is to the earth, the
dew to the thirsting tlowor, the stars to the night,
love to the heart, religion to the soul, and a quart
of beer diluted with a hot saveloy to a Rdji poet s
blngie, such is the average popular parson to the
spicy Divorce Court sensations of the present day.
This time, tho co-respondent is described as being
“ a clerical person of mature age, austere character,
and high rank In his church organization ”—quite a
nineteenth-century copy of that giddy old eider of
Daniel’s day who, touting the chaste Susanna,
attempted to screen his own rascality by declaring
he had surprised her in the company ot her hus-
band’s coachman under a spreading mastic tree.
In the Cabbage Garden case the chaste Susanna
is a leader of fashion, and so v rand a person that
she “ was not quite sure whether dear Lady Loch s
kind heart would not induce her to receive per-
sons whom one could not possibly meet! It would
be such a pity to have to ignore Government
Housel” The injured husband is described as
being one of the curled darlings of South
Yarra, or, in every-day English, a swell official of
good standing and ample private means. All this
1, common-p'ace enough, and a matter of every-
day occurrence, so to speak, but here’s where the
laugh comes in. The virile old church dignitary is
not the only one on whom our aristocratic dame
conferred her favours. Several lesser lights are
reported as being “in the swim” as well, and
amongst these is the lady’s Buttons, an unfledged
young angel of about fifteen summers. Some-
thing like a wave of infidelity to matrimonial
contracts is apparently sweeping, over,Victoria
just at present, but we suppose it’s all on account
of the dry weather, for, as Byron sings,
“ What men call gallantry, and gods adultery, t
Is much more common whtre the climates
sultry.”
And this reminds us touching our own sweet
skives. It is rumoured that a popular preacher—
however, that will keep a little longer. Sufficient
for the day is as good as a feast.
He was a Capting in the Hnrmy engaged
in the conquest of New Zealand, and for the first
time in his life he found himself outside a horse.
His intention was to invade a certain township and
‘ take it ” by force of arms. The steed bestrode by
the undaunted warrior was the property of the
local pound-keeper, who also lighted the street
lamps In the borough where the Capting had nis
head-quarters. The horse was accustomed to carry
his master round from post to post. The lamp-
lighter’s usual custom was to carry a box or
matches in his mouth, and when he reached a post
he stood on the horse’s back, lit the lamp, and de-
scePBding to his seat on the saddle, started tor the
nekt. In this way the horse came to know his
business well. When the Capting started on the
1 expedition, there was a chorus of hallelujahs from
the sisters assembled to send him off. They saw
him off—In fact, in more ways than one. The old
horse started well, spreading himself out over the
street as if he was “in It ” for the Derby and was
determined to win, while the Capting held on to
the mane as if It was a favourite text and was well
worth sticking to. When the fiery steed reached
the first lamp-post, however, be paused suddenly
from a bard gallop to a full stop, while the rider
continued the journey some distance further and
came down a cropper on his hat, to the terror and
dismay of the sisterhood, who rushed to his assist-
ance and clustered round him in a tumultuous
whirlpool of hallelujah bonnets, each dear sister
struggling heroically who should be first to kiss the
bump widen had “suffeied ” in the collision with
Macadam. After a deal of endearment bad been in-
dulged In, the Capting was sufficiently recovered to
make another dash for an outside passage; but on
getting astride the animal, he found It would not
budge from its position under the lamp. One of
the sisters, however, who was tbe lamp-lighter s
maiden aunt, here came to the rescue, and ex-
plained to the Capting that he must make pretence
of lighting the lamp if he expected the horse to
go on. The Capting accordingly stood up in the
saddle and struck a match; but before he could
get back into his seat, the horse started at a gallop
for the next post, while the unfortunate amateur
lamp-lighter tumbled off backwards over the ani-
mal's tail, and fell groaning in the dust from which
he had just newly risen. The sOters again gathered
round him, like a lot of hens converging and cack-
ling round a dying eock-a-doodle; and, cheered by
their renewed sympathy and endearments, ho
shook hims If together on one end, and seeing the
horse standiug patiently at the next lamp-post,
started to try his luck once more as a performer
of wonders and miracles on horseback. His re-
newed efforts at imitating the lamp-lighter were
more successful, and nothing further occurred till
the last lamp-post was reached, when, satisfied that
his duties in that respect were over for the day,
the horse started for the pound at a furious canter,
which nearly shook the Capting’s buttons off, and
seriously disarranged his digestive functions. On
reaching the pound gate, the horse suddenly stood
still, and chucked the Captiug into the enclosure
to keep company with a wild bull impounded
three days before. As this gentle animal had had
next to nothing to eat since his incarceration,
he was not in a mood to be trifled with, and de-
clined to swallow the Capting's remark to the effect
that all flesh is grass, which the latter made imme-
diately on finding himself on his back in the Pound
with his eyes full of manure and serious defalca-
tion apparent in his costume both fore and aft.
The bull was very hungry, and had been led to
expect some consideration in the way of turnips;
but when he investigated the Capting’s bald head,
he knew at a sniff it was not the kind of vegetable
he wanted, so he threw his nose ominously in the
air, lashed the fence with his long tail, and began
to raw the bottom out of the Pound with his heavy
forefeet. Just then the Capting started up, and
the bull immediately started forward and inserted
a horn in his uniform and returned him with
thanks to the horse on the outside of the Pound.
But the Capting had enough of it, and gave up the
expedition till a more convenient season: and,
taking a round-about road to avoid observation,
sought the shelter of the barracks for repairs.
“ Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate,
And nodded o’er his keys; when, iol there came
A wondrous noise he had not heard of late,
A rustling sound of wind, and stream, and flame;
In short, a roar of things extremely great. ”
And when the commotion cooled down a trifle,
the worthy old janitor polished uj his nose with
the sleeve end of one of his wings, and yelled,
“Hullo! who’s thar?" “Keep your seat, Peter;
it’s only me,” replied a tall, gaunt, slab-sided old
dead-beat, as he hung a tattered umbrella and a
battered carpet-bag on the spikes of the gate, and
handed over a card, on which was written “Ter-
tius Bullwinkle. Esq., editor Cooreenyrangah-
COOMBOOB1LAH TIMES AND JACKASS GOLLY AD-
VERTISER." "Oh, Its you, is it?’ exclaimed the
apostle, as he double-locked the inner grating;
"well, th’ best thing you can do Is to slide round
to the Hades Hotel before It shuts, an’ see If you
can get a bed there. We’ve got special orders not
to let you la here at any price whatever. As a
rule, we never do care muon lor you newspaper
fellers at all, because y ’ eat more at one square
meal than all th’ rest o’ th’ cherubim an’ seraphim
out together; and as for jlnin’ in th’ sacred pro-
cessional hymns, why y’re got no more voice
than a fried sardine, an’ the whole of your
‘reppertwor’ seems t’ consist ov ‘Nancy Lee’
an’ the ‘Two ubidiahs.’” “Pardon me, Peter,”
said the new arrival; “but I was the solo basso
profundo In our little choir at Jackass Gully for
over fifteen years, and the ease with which I used
to take the bottom D’s was the admiration and
envy of the w hole district. I’ll just warble a little
thing of my own, as a sample. Do-Mi-Sol ”
“Here, that’s enough,” shrieked the enraged
janitor; “if you let out another yelp, I’ll brain
you with these keys. We don’t want you or your
measly old voice in here at all. We heard you
were cornin’—in fact, we read y’r lyin’ poetry send-
off in last night’s Evenooze, and in less than half-
an-hour after 767 signatures were stuck oh to a
petition not to let you within cooey of this here
gate.” “Oh, hoi” replied the editor, as he opened
his carpet-bag, and unrolled a bundle of papers;
“ tbe wretched hirelings of my native land object
to my company, do they 7 Trot ’em out, and let
them state their objections in propria personce.”
The janitor went ins.de on hearing this, but shortly
after returned with a multitude of enraged, howl-
ing citizens, who flourished their harps and flapped
their wings in the most alarming manner possible.
On Mr. Bullwinkle being pointed out, a mad-
headed old seraph dressed in spangled tights
poked his head through a hole in the gate, and
yelled, ‘ Yah! you’re euchred this lime, olu
’un. Why didn’t you give my circus show a
puff, an’ say the daring feats of horsemanship
displayed by Mens, and Madame Angelico have
never been surpassed this side of the equatorial
line ; whilst the chaste performances of the
monkey Jacko, and the trick dog Julius Caesar,
are enjoyed alike by babbling childhood and
venerable old age. Why didn’t you put that in
yer rag, hey 7” “ Simply because you got all your
job-printing done at the Jackass Gully Star, and
your name’s not Angelico at all but O’Ragin,” re-
plied the censured editor, coolly. “Come down,”
shouted Peter ; “ that let’s you- out, anyhow.”
“ Why didn’t you notice that monster egg I sent
you 7” shrieked another red-faced angel behind the
bars: “it was live inches long, and four inches in
circumference, and spoke volumes for the wonder-
ful efficiency to which we had brought the art of
laying. Governor Loftus has a futtoe of it in his
bedroom ” “Yer darned old egg was rotten,’’
shouted Bullwinkle back; “an’ when it bust we
h id to shift tbe office ” “ Skip down,” cried Peter,
“the man from Jackass Gully scores two.” “ Look
hero, you abominable wretch,” shrieked a spike-
nosed, putty-faced virgin ; “ in my lines to
Lorenzo L , I wrote,
‘Sad was my heart; gloom filled my soul from day
to day,
But soon the right man came and parted all away.’
It was sweetly pretty; but you, you dirty, wall-
eyed, web-looted, whisky-besmeared ignoramus,
you made It read, ‘ The right man came and carted
all away.' Ooooh ! I’d Use to tie you on to the
beast with seven heads that’s In here, and let him
scoot round the plainsof Hades with your ugly pole-
cat perfumed carcase.” “Gently Madam,” observed
the editor; “ keep y’r hose on—there’s the manu-
script, and I’ll defy the recording angel himself to
read it.” “Verdict for the defendant;” chimed in
the janitor. “Why did you write up old man
Maggles’s scab-wasu, and never say a word about
my new system of extracting liquid manure from
dead dogs ?” squeaked a dried-up old party in
seedy, snutf-coioured robes. “Because Maggies
paid me for printing all his pamphlets, and you
stuck the mighty lever which moves the world,
otherwise known as Jackass Gully Advertiser
for seven-an’-twenty shillings,” returned the other
witn a grim-sardonic smile. The rest of the elect
then began to yell out their complaints in unison,
but Mr. Bullwinkle calmly sorted a pile of bills of
unpaid subscribers, and it came to pass that when
he attempted to serve the company with them,
they all tore their hair, and rushing over a steep
place near the coast broke their nocks first, and
were afterwards carried out to sea and drowned.
But Peter, taking Bulliwinkle by the hand, ex-
claimed, “Trot right in here, old man; these
chaps bluffed us here, but thanks to the un-
shackled press which now delivers its invaluable
wares alike at tbe threshold of Paradise and the
gates of Hell on payment of 13s., strictly in
advance, we now know the exact style of hair-
pin these fellow are. Come right along and stay ;
we badly want a few such men as you in here.’
And humping his kit once more, Bullwinkle
followed.
Our picture shows a lovely morning bonnet for a watering plaoe—not but that it
would be elegant anywhere, it is so light and pretty. It is composed of cream surah
and lace, and can be made from the illustration by any one who has taste in that line.
The crown la of stiff not, covered with the surah, and the peak is trimmed with two
rows of deep lace, and a bunch of heliotrope adorns the side of the bonnet strings; and
