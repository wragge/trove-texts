Lack of the necessary generating equipment, coupled with the high cost of
erecting transmission lines, has prohibited electric power being extended
into sparsely populated areas. In such places a complete electric service
can, however, be obtained by means of the

This plant is compact, economical, safe and easy to operate, and will provide
electric light and power for every need in the home. A special feature is
the pulley mounted on the main shaft of the engine, to which can be
belted either direct or by overhead shafting the many machines that are neces-
sary on a farm. We will gladly furnish full particulars on request. Write to-day.

A Literary Monument
To H. G. Wells Author
A consecutive history of all times, a human-voiced recital, vivid and glowing,
inspiring and illuminating—such is the monument of Wells that Wells has given
the world in his “Outline of History.”
The events, the peoples, the all .of History parade
before us, and we see with the eyes of Mr. Wells
—we see history without mere marbles and mum-
mies, history minus lavishly-belauded heroes stand-
ing in ill-proportioned dominance —we see his-
tory and humanity as it ever has been, and not
as fervid memorialists have usually gushingly
given it to us. Certainly we receive many jars
in experiencing the smashing of illusions and the
flouting of dogmas —but we are broader for it, we
see things as they are, as they should be seen.
Get this history of millions of years and multi-
tudes of people, if you are interested in that big
query, Life.

The Red Page
Man or Superman?
Cosmopolitan critics have* laid their scorn-
ful diatribes at the stage-door of British
drama; for, excepting the merely innocuous
family dramas built on some slight variation
of the 7 th commandment and plays with a
definite social purpose, British drama is a
pretty washed-out thing. It is an affair of
middle-class minds swayed by the iron rod
of a bigoted censor. Hence, although excel-
lently translated many years ago, the plays
of Gabriele d’Annunzio cannot be said to
have broken the ice of English insular pre-
judice : the reason being that d’Annunzio
deals with women. He even breaks into
their rooms and (shameful thought) un-
dresses them. He illustrates female
beauty, the voluptuous beauty of living
woman, proud and unashamed, in all the
grace and charm of her seductiveness, as no
other dramatist lias dared to do. He ex-
presses the significance of flesh. No grace
or seduction is lost upon him. His plays
are never immoral, but they are tremendously
sexual. For that reason he is largely
ignored by English-speaking people; while
in his own country, so nrofound and varied
is his classical culture, so magic the music
of his lyre, so flamboyant the patriotism of
his oratory, that he is the uncrowned
laureate of modern Italy.
Half d’Annunzio’s work remains untrans-
lated in English, though most of it has ap-
peared in French. Practically since the year
of his birth, in 1863, he has been the spoilt
child of the Muses. Erato baptised him in
pleasure and Melpomene gave him her bus-
kin. At 16 he published lyric verses of
turbulent eroticism: at 18 he succeeded the
poet Garducci in popular favor. Later he
published plays of subtle invention, display-
ing the primary passions, and novels listing
the perversions and depicting soul-states in
a sanatorium. His mind refused bondage.
He became a virtuoso in artistic vice, a
cunning artificer of words, a collector of sen-
sational curios. He lived in the rare moment
of creative vigor: he became meteoric, flash-
ing to the final analysis of a perverse im-
pulse or to assist at the toilet of a woman’s
soul. His first two plays—“The Dream
of a Spring Morning” and “The Dream of
an Autumn Sunset”—-are romantic tragedies
of adulterous wives. “La Gioconda” shows
the vacillations of a sculptor betwen the
attractions of a saintly wife and a model—a
lithe animal-woman, sex incarnate. “Fran-
cesca di Rimini” is a variation on Dante’s
version, embroidered with eroticism and ris-
ing to lyrical fervor in the final scene.
“Light Under the Bushel” and “More Than
Love” contain sensational seductions. “The
Dead City” plays on ideas of incest; and
“The Ship” glorifies a courtesan. A sadis-
tic strain is in them all.
In his novels d’Annunzio poses as the
high priest of hedonism. Iu his world there
are only two things—art and sex. His
novels show states of minds tortufed with
the desires of the living. lie works passion
on the woof of regret into a pattern of decay.
He combines a hypertrophied sexual sensi-
bility with a polyphonic mind: his prose
sings like the strings of invisible harps. He
displays, a pagan sense of beauty in jewelled
prose. He paints seduction with opulent
words, in ,a language expressive of every
enchantment. He flings superlative allu-
sions about with the air of one who inherits
the culture of the centuries. Though lack-
ing in humor, his feeling is intense and his
cruelty is concentrated on the tremors of
toothless gums and the palsy of paralysed
limbs. His male characters are principally
devoted to the; aesthetic cultivation of mor-
bidities. His women are descended from
Venus Etaira. All the contradictions of the
female temperament, the impassioned lure
and the grossness underlying the lyric sor-
cery, from the frenzied sensualism of Ippo-
lita to the virgin chastity of Bianca, d’An-
nunzio draws in tropical profusion. Per-
haps his best-known novel in English is
“The Triumph of Death.” for it contains a
prose interpretation of Wagner’s “Tristan.”
But “The Virgins of the Rocks” remains his
best book —a veritable poem in prose. The
carnal muse is absent, and the book opens
with a sacerdotal intonation; then with a
change of tempo it passes into a plaintive
second movement, where the young man con-
templates the bodies of the three women,
superb in their sterility, famished with un-
namffbie desires. He realises sorrow because
it is spoiling the texture of life, and the cur-
tain falls'on the final harmony of lamenta-
tions.
In “The Flame of Life” d’Annunzio
sketched a foreshadowing of his own career
in the poet-hero who was moved to oratory
in the Doge’s Palace. For early in the
Great War d’Annunzio himself urged his
countrymen to make their country worthy of
its past. When some weeks later Italy
declared war on Austria, d’Annunzio put on
a uniform and joined the air forces. He
was wounded and decorated ; and at the age
of 60. surpassing the daring of the youngest
aviators, he made his famous flight over
Vienna. Literary critics were confounded.
Ten years before they had dubbed him a de-
cadent, a dilettante of pleasure, blinded by
the fumes of voluptuous delight. Now he
was wearing uniform, fighting with the Allies
with energy and courage, and, like a ghost
of Garibaldi, urging on his comrades with
all the persuasion of passionate eloquence.
Always a little tinged with Nietzsehean
ideas, he became the superman of Italy.
Zarathtistra on a throne. The whole world
knows of his -exploits at Fitime. How his
curious career is to end, how his literary
works will fare in the hands of posterity,
none can say.
REG. S. ELLERY.
The Dreamer of Kubla Khan
The empire of Kubla Khan included the
whole of China. Tibet, Manchuria and
Korea : it cut deeply into what is now Bur-
mall, thrust forth a wedge which took in
the whole of Tongking and pushed far up
beyond Lake Baikal into Siberia. The
empire of Genghis or Zingis, which extended
from Korea to Bulgaria and included North-
ern Persia and Southern Russia, had been
greater in extent: but it did not din far
into China nor touch the larger wealth of
the most populous region of Asia. Kubla
or Kublai is a tremendously important person
in the history of Asia; but he finished in tire
time of Henry 111. of England, and nobody
has worried much about him since. Yet his
name will probably far outlive that of any
Tartar or Manchu, for the prominence given
to him by Coleridge in his poem is more
than the march of armies or the clanging of
all the gongs of war from Samareand to
Karakoram. The story of how the poet fell
asleep over a book, dreamt the verses, started
to write them down, was interrupted and
forgot the greater part of his dream is a
commonplace in the story of our literature.
“Purchas his Pilgrimage” was the book that
Coleridge was reading, a work of the early
17th century, largely based on Hakluyt.
There occurs the passage: “In Xamdu did
Gublai Can build a stately Palace, encom-
passing sixteene miles of plaine ground with
a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, plea-
sant Springs, delightful Streames, and all
sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in
the middest thereof a sumptuous house of
pleasure.” On that the poet built his 44
astonishing lines, and intended to build a
lot more if he could get into the mood. That
he did not get into the mood is cause for
great thankfulness. Coleridge at his great-
est touches very high stars; at .his worst he
sinks in very deep mud. “Kubla Khan”
was written in 1798 and first published in
1816. If he had added to it after that date
the results might have been very bad. Every-
body who has written of Coleridge has a
word of astonishment and admiration for
“Kubla Khan,” hut as far as I know none of
the writers makes the simple observation
about it that, in spite of its author’s opinion,
it is finished. Nothing more is needed; the
thought is complete, the picture perfect, the
concluding note without any broken cadence.
“Christabel” is unfinished —it leaves an exas-
perating sense of something marvellous to
come—but it is scarcely possible to believe
that a line could have been added to “Kubla
Khan” without taking from its greatness.
In 1797 Coleridge wrote “The Ancient Mar-
iner” and “Christabel”; in 1798 he wrote
“Kubla Klian” and the “Ode to France.”
So the remarkable fact stands that, as he
was born in 1772, his period of greatest
poetic achievement ended at exactly the age
at which Keats died; for though Coleridge
lived on until 1834 his later fame does not
rest upon his later poetry. Though a great
critic who spoke sure words about our great-
est writers of English, his earlier promise
as a weaver of magic words was not fulfilled.
He is a very great poet; as a pathfinder
there is no one to stand beside him. • The
-very note of Shelley is in hi.s “France”;
“Kubla Khan” must have been the chief
inspiration of Poe; Tennyson constantly
echoes him ; almost every modern poet owes
him a direct debt. Yet the feeling of the
reader and lover of his work is a half-
doubting regret. Of him more than of any-
one else it seems true that with some small
thing added to his make-up he -must have
been infinitely greater. Tennyson assures
us that the poet’s soul is a delicate mechan-
ism, and any tampering is no doubt danger-
ous : but we could have wished for an ounce
more of grit, a faint stiffening of the char-
acter’, the shadowy something needed to
make this man grow to his full stature. Had
he done so he must have been the greatest
of all.
C. O. M.
One of the Missing
When Villa met Huerta at Torreon to
decide 'syho should have the sole right to
burn, rape, pillage and cut throats, things
essential to the maintenance of liberty and
the Mexican Constitution, the former’'* staff
included an American soldier of fortune,
arrogant of disposition, fierce of eye, up-
right of ‘carriage. 72 years of age; When
heads were counted later the ancient swash-
buckler was among the missing, and with
his passing the world lost the greatest
master of the tragic short story since Edgar
Allan Poe. Ilis name was Ambrose Bierce.
It would have tickled Bierce’s cynical
humor immensely if he had known that
while Harold Bell Wright is bought by the
hundred-weight in Australia his own name
is so unfamiliar that booksellers mostly look
at you sideways and think you have invented
him. Not that Bierce did not want popu-
larity: every man writes that he may be
read, and in his heart hungers for apprecia-
tion. But Bierce differed from the majority
in that he would not pay the usual price.
Seen through his bitter eyes, the world was
a sordid sham: corruption was every-
where, self-interest the dominant motive.
Other men have thought the same, and have
gone away and written nice sugary stories
full of virtue and the joy of life. But
Bierce dceliued to bow his stiff neck or
hide his mocking smile, and he found his
chief pleasure in goading the great Ameri-
can public with savage prose and verse like
these lines from his “ratidnal anthem”: —
My country ’tis of thee,
Sweet land of felony,
Of thee I sing—■
Land where my fathers fried -
Young witches and applied
Whips to the Quaker’s hide •
And made him spring.
My knavish c'ountry, thee’,
Land where the" thief is free,
Thy lawfi I love.
I love thy thieving bills
That tap the people's tills, i
I love thy mob whose will’s
All laws above.
Bierce’s work falls into three divisions—
satiye. criticism and fiction. His satire was
mordant and clever, his criticism original
if not always'sound. Some of the definitions
from his “Devil’s Dictionary” arc admirable:
Impostor, n. —A rival aspirant for public honors.
Positive, adj.- —Mistaken at the top of one’s voice.
Recruit, n. —A person distinguishable from a
civilian by his uniform and from a soldier by his
gait.
Rebel, n. —A proponent of a new misrule who has
failed to establish it.
Rapacity, n. —Providence without industry. The
thrift of power.
But it is on his fiction that Bierce must
rely for immortality. He began his curious

mhdmill
was erected in 180S on the Appin Road, near the old
town of Campbelltown. It was built of dressed stone,
with centre shaft, gear wheel and pinion made of hard-
wood. One hundred years ago the old Mill ground the
grain sown in the district into flour for the needs of
the pioneers. What a contrast to the scientifically-
constructed
BILLA60NG MILL
of to-day, made from steel and iron, with steel ball-
bearings, silent in action and regulating its speed to any
breeze by its own combined Speed Regulator and
Governor! This patented contrivance prevents racing,
adapts the speed of the wheel to the wind, and automati-
cally pulls it out of the gale when it is dangerous to
pump.
The “Billabong” is built stronger and more massive
than is actually necessary; the future as well as the
present is provided for by the makers. Other points are:
massive main castings, automatic lubrication, centre lift,
and split bearings which can be renewed without removing
any gear. Duplicate parts at low cost. The quality
Mill at a moderate price.

PINKETTES
A DAINTY LAXATIVE
The day of harsh purgatives, of
big cathartic pills is over —gone for
ever. No need ary longer to
swallow a nauseating dose to give
nature the gentle assistance re-
quired. Pinkettes, the new laxative,
are little pink, sugar-coated ovals,
easy to take and pleasant in their
action. They are not drastic,
although certain and thorough.
Pinkettes are designed to
arouse the sluggish bowels and tor-
pid liver, to correct bad breath,
clear the complexion, and banish
biliousness and headache.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Sleep o t Sleep.
Grey half-light, at the end of day,
Gum-trees still on the green hillside,
Cattle moving with flanks a-sway
Shoulder-deep in the stirless tide.
Sea-birds, tired of their daylong quest,
Grouped together on spit and beach,
Blue cranes flapping their slow way west —
Homeward hieing to some far reach.
One late swallow that circling swoops,
Big bronze beetles that blunder by,
Sheoaks standing in brooding groups,
Bloodwoods lifting their crests on high.
Sleep lies stretched on his bracken-bed
Eyes half-closed, while the lights grow dim
On sapling-tops in the distance red,
And ti-trees pallid of trunk and limb.
Now and then, through the breezeless air,
Stealing inward, as steals a ghost,
Comes the murmur of seas that rear
Charge and fall on the outer coast.
Sounds the tide like a man who drinks
Full and deep, as it washes in;
One leaf, eddying downward,- sinks—
Reft for aye from kith and kin.
Comes the moment when bat and moth
Quit their shelter of cave and tree,
Darkness falls like a velvet cloth
Spread in silence o’er land and sea.
Odors steal through the dewy dusk;
Scents of leafage and trees in bloom,
Scents of lemon and spice and musk
Rise, and sweeten the stirless gloom.
No wave circles from pin or keel,
Stars no light on the waters shed;
Deep, deep down in my soul I feel
Sleep sleeps sound on his bracken-bed.
Shadows gather beneath the trees.
Silent shapes in the gloom abide ;
Couched in bracken, with limbs at ease,
Sleep lies slumbering by the tide.

Gippsland Yet.
Blue Gippsland skies on my young life smiled
(But time is brief; how the years soon
flee).
By Omeo-road or Mario mild
Are trails I travelled at Fate’s decree;
Ah, paths where wild convolvulus free,
Sarsaparilla and ferny rill
Make for God’s bushland a filigree—
My heart, my heart is in Gippsland still.
For Gippsland forests seem temple-aisled,
Her birds lift Heavenward an anthemed
plea—
A Church of Nature not granite-piled
But at her shrine I am devotee.
The stately Tambo glides tranquilly,
And wmttles bloom and their incense spill
On Mitchell waters that dance in glee—
My heart, my heart is in Gippsland still.
Oh. Gippsland hills that are grand and wild,
Her bush and rivers so fair to me,
I learnt to love her and was her child
From far, dim days of my infancy ;
With her, ah, with her, I yearn to be
When grey, grim Death gives his hand-grip
chill.
There I would sleep near a gnarled gum-
tree —
My heart, my heart is in Gippsland still.
Envoy.
Dear Gippsland girl, in a minor key
My muse is tuned though the heart-strings
thrill;
Long years since you died in Arcady,
My heart, Sweetheart, is in Gippsland
still!

Rondeau Redouble.
Peace, poppy-crowned, sits silent after tears.
Her firm white hands are warm and strong
to keep.
Great Mars is dead and memory dimmed by
years,
Above the far horizon brimmed with sleep.
Supreme she is; the dead are dead. The
deep
Rolls vastly round them, and the snow-
drop rears
Her crystal head from earth, in earth to
weep.
Peace, poppy-crowned, .sits silent after
tears.
The pain-worn World no longer sickly fears
The vanquished god. Harvest there is
to reap
Pleasure and work, though old Time watch-
ing sneers,
Her firm white hands are warm and strong
to keep.
Peace on the plain, and on the purple
steep —
We say with pride and strength, omnis-
cient seers.
“Murder lies strangled ’neath a flowery
heap,
Great Mars is dead, and memory dimmed
by years.”
But even as we sing, through swinging
spheres,
Swift, quiet, faintly devilish faces leap
Along the sky, and old Time nodding leers
Above the far horizon brimmed with
sleep,
And War awakes, and hideous cryings creep.
Murder a master strong again appears.
Cruelty’s hands are red, foul passions
sweep—
Lie you so low, weeping your bloody
tears,
Peace, poppy-crowned?

MAKING THE WORLD SAFE FOR
BLOODSHED.
Dubing the late war the Allied Govern-
ments promised, as soon as they got the
chance, to hang the Kaiser and other mur-
derers, and go through the pockets of his
subjects. Whether they believed it was pos-
sible to do these things, or meant to if they
could, their protestations on the subject were
useful for propaganda purposes: they helped
to stimulate that fury of enthusiasm which
is so necessary when the elders of the
nations are calling from their comfortable
and secure positions upon /the masses to
go forth and sacrifice themselves. The war
is already becoming ancient history, and if
it were not for the cripples and the pro-
fiteers, Bolshevism and the growing army
of unemployed (Britain now has about a
million and a quarter, and is spending
millions sterling per annum on the feeding
of ex-soldiers alone), high prices and
devaluated money, and, above all, the
memory of good men gone—if it were
not for these and a few hundred other tra-
gedies we might begin to forget that the
war to end wars had ever been waged.
Nevertheless, not a single prominent war-
criminal has even been arrested; and the
arch-malefactor, as he used to be represented
when it was necessary to raise the anger of
the multitude to boiling-point, is chiefly con-
cerned on the legal side as to whether he
will get the £1,700,000, which is the sum his
suffering countrymen are said to be willing
to give him, or the round two millions sterl-
ing which he claims. Last week the Lloyd
Geokge Government provided an explanation
of the Kaiser’s immunity. To take him
“would involve war with Holland.” Hol-
land, with a population of under six millions,
has a field army of 125,000 officers and men
(say half the original 8.E.F.) and an out-
of-date fleet (most of its capital ships are
upwards of 20 years old) manned by about
9000 sailors. France, with 800,000 veteran
soldiers under arms, and Britain with a
fleet whose personnel at the beginning of
this year after all obsolete ships (the
Renown was one of them) had been
scrapped, amounted to 162,000 ranks and
ratings, would not go to war with such a
Power if it acted inequitably; they would
discipline it. The ex-Ivaiser has no moral or
other claim on the Dutch people, who would
suffer if the Netherlands Government was
mad enough to make a casus belli of him;
though he no doubt has on the Queen, whose
dynasty was founded by a German Count,
and on her husband, who is a German prince
and a near relation. In Dutch law his status
is that of a private citizen, and as such
he has no more right to sanctuary than
a fugitive embezzler. Of course, it would
be impolitic to make a martyr of him, but
the politicians such as Li,oyd George, who
promised three or four years ago that they
would do just that, must have foreseen the
reactions of an Imperial martyrdom. His-
tory had plenty of examples to offer them.
So there are other reasons why not only
the ex-Kaiser and his sons, but the distin-
guished persons who were responsible for
the. sinking of the Lusitania (they are indi-
cated in Ludendorff’s “The General Staff
and Its Problems”), the authors of the Bel-
gian reprisals (the Belgian Government has
their names), and the rest of the atrocity-
specialists should be left so very much alone.
Under the Peace Treaty the whole of the
property belonging to German nationals
abroad may be forfeited. The Public Trus-
tees of the various countries give notes for
the values of the sequestrated estates, and
the former owners may then, if they are
optimists enough to think it worth while,
claim from the German Government. By
this arrangement the Commonwealth has
taken over about £6,000,000 worth of pro-
perty, and further amounts are being secured
from time to time. Rightly or wrongly the
rumor grows that strong pressure is being
exercised to induce the Hughes Government
to hand back most of this money, more par-
ticularly in the Islands, where the planters
have a great deal of influence. It would
only be consistent if the Government agreed.
While Irishmen like Osmond Esmonde are
shut out of the Commonwealth and Austra-
lian-born citizens unable to speak a word of
German, such as Father Jerger, are de-
ported, every big city—and notably Syd-
ney—and many country districts contain
men, in the full enjoyment of liberty and
property, who were bred and educated in
Germany. They may have been naturalised.
Foreign naturalisation has never involved
the loss of German citizenship, and one N. S.
Wales captain of commerce, whose birth-
place and home are in Prussia, admitted at
the beginning of the war that he had been
naturalised for business reasons in two other
countries before he became an Australian.
They may also be prepared to take the
oath of allegiance, or any other oath; and
they may be willing to curse their native
land to the limit of their exiguous English
vocabularies. Judas did worse for a smaller
wage. Nevertheless most of them deserve
to be dispossessed if the planters do; and
on the sound old principle that a false friend
is more dangerous than an avowed enemy,
the majority of them are less desirable as
citizens. The Public Trustee in England is
daily seizing the property of socially negli-
gible Germans. “At Putlick and Simp-
son’s,” remarks one of the latest editions of
London Times to hand in Australia, “Rem-
brandt and other etchings from the stock of
Mr. Richard Gutekunst, a former enemy
alien, were sold by order of the Public Trus-
tee, and fetched very high sums.” However,
the titled enemy aliens, the enemy aliens
of prominence in international finance, and
the enemy aliens who before the war were
persona grata at Court, have suffered little;
and it is well understood that after a rea-
sonable period they are to be taken back to
the fold as though the late unpleasantness
had never been. It is the same, broadly, all
over the Empire. With us the old Pagan
cry of “Woe to the conquered!” is qualified
by the addition of the words, “provided,
always, the conquered are obscure.”
In the interests of the common people—
those who get no chances to make fortunes
out of war contracts, and who fight in the
ranks instead of being given high commands
—it is highly desirable that a few representa-
tive German leaders should be hanged and
that every penny belonging to Germans in
the Empire should be taken. It would be
absurd to destroy the Kaiser. Apart from
the help it might give the monarchist cause
in Germany, all the Hun war memoirs agree-
that, except in name, he was responsible for
nothing of importance either militarily or
politically. What the interests of civilisa-
ton require is an assorted collection of
notables comprising (say) half-a-dozen lead-
ing statesmen and diplomatists, some belli-
cose professors, and a score of generals and
admirals. Their punishment should not be
inflicted in a punitive spirit, but, as in the
case of ordinary criminals, with an eye
solely to prevention. Once the precedent
is established that the leaders who lose a
war will be treated. as the P. and O. com-
pany automatically treats a master who loses
his ship—that is, as guilty, no matter who
did the actual piling up—there is bound to
be a diminution of that swashbuckling
attitude so common in those with all to gain
and nothing to fear from an international
rupture. But the statesman and diploma-
tists only handle the levers of the war
machine. They could do little without the
co-operation of those who build it up, supply
the fuel and so forth. Trade and commerce
tend to become more and more internation-
alised as the world’s tariffs rise and rise.
Only the petty concerns can remain at home.
The Rothschilds, Raphaels, Sassoons and
Morgans are in every country. The great
British firm of Armstrong, Whitworth
and Co. is the Armstrong-Pozzuoli Co. in
one part of Italy and the Ansaldo-Arm-
strong Co. in another. It is the Hispana
Shipping Co. in Spain, and it does good ser-
vice for Japan at Muroran, while before the
war it had branches in Austria and Turkey,
No war risk can prevent such trade develop-
ments ; but the people behind the cosmopoli-
tan banks and trusts are likely to use all
their immense influence to prevent wars
once they know that whichever side wins
they will certainly be penalised and perhaps
ruined. The natural inclination in the high-
est official and financial quarters is to main-
tain the old order. They want to have it
both ways as before. But the prospect offers
no attractions to the millions who never
want to see a war again ; and one of their
few hopes of peace consists in making the
awful sport too dangerous to be worth while
from the point of view of those who have
formerly revelled in it.
THE REVIVAL OF A PRE-WAR
IMPOSTURE.
“This thing [disloyalty] must be stopped, and
stopped as early as possible, in the interests of our
community. There must be a clear line of demar-
cation between those who are for the Empire and
those who are against it.” — President of Sydney’s
newly-formed King and Empire Alliance.
The words will ring familiarly in most Aus-
tralian ears. Right up to the outbreak of
war .they represented the oratorical heavy
artillery of the anti-Labor legions. The lead-
ing Empire-bursters in those days were
Hughes and Holman, and every politically-
ambitious young attorney or barrister or
business man thundered against these trai-
tors and their followers on public platforms,
and were alternately despairing and scornful
about them in clubs and Liberal committee-
rooms. The war delivered a knock-out blow
to one of the biggest bluffs in the history of
this country. The idea had been that the
professional classes, and the people with
money generally, were ipso facto “King’s
Men.” Condemned by fate to the ignoble
business of serving writs on people, or sell-
ing them wool or ironmongery or under-
garments or what not, their real ambition
was to break: a lance on the tented field for
their Sovereign and their Empire. The
worker, contrariwise, was disaffected, un-
chivalrous. cowardly, furtive —a disloyalist
and a clod. The war had not been in pro-
gress for many months before it was noticed
that numbers of eager young British Em-
pire Leaguers (the King and Empire
Alliance lads of the period) were still on
their sheep-stations or following their pro-
fessions. The difference was that for the
first time in years they were doing it in
silence. A reason for their sudden abandon-
ment of the denunciatory pose was the fact
that the disloyalist sections —the unionists
and the Irish, were enlisting freely. About
80 per cent, of Australia’s unionists of fight-
ing age joined up, and rather more than that
proportion of fit men of Irish extraction.
(The number of R.C.’s in the A.I.F. was
60,503—0 r 20 per cent, of the army—and
most of them were of Hibernian origin.) Not
only did the professional patriots stay away
from the war with great enthusiasm, but
where they did offer themselves care was
taken usually that the venture should in-
volve no bodily peril. It was always 10
times easier to find a “King’s Man” of the
noisy, protesting order in a Red Cross or
Comforts Funds office, as C.O. troops on a
transport, or as adjutant at a base-camp,
than in the Salient or on the Somme.
* * * *
It is a sure sign that the danger really
is over and the country returning to normal
that this war-exploded lie about the dis-
loyalty of Certain large classes should be
revived. On the figures it might be argued
with a certain amount of speciousness that
particular professions—more especially in
N. S. Wales—are disloyal. The record as
regards enlistments—and that is the acid-
test after all —in legal circles was pitiable.
Even the doctors who started their sacrifice
with the pay and rank of a captain did none
too well. But every sensible person knows
that ambition, avarice, selfishness or what-
ever other term may be chosen was the actu-
ating motion with these young men, and not
a mad desire to see the Empire destroyed.
And just as rational people know this, so
also do they know that neither the workers
.who fought nor the ones who didn’t; neither
the Australians who believe in Irish self-
determination nor the ones who regard such
a thing as a crime; neither Laborites, Social-
ists, nor any other political party that mat-
ters, wish anything but well to the Empire.
Some may believe in letting Ireland go. So
do many eminent Englishmen of unblemished
patriotism. Some may consider England’s
present attitude to Ireland on a par with the
recent attitude of Germany in Belgium. Six-
teen English bishops think the same and
have put their hands to a memorial to that
effect. Some may hold with tremendous
social changes. So did Lloyd George six
years ago, and so does many another repu-
table British statesman to-day. It is a
piece of blatant impudence to" attach abu-
sive epithets to such schools of thought. But
the King and Empire slogan stands for inep-
titude as well. The reason why every Aus-
tralian worker who is not a suicidal lunatic
is for the Empire, and bound to fight for it
again and again if required, was put with
admirable frankness and clarity by the Dean
of St. Paul’s (London) last week: —
The result of the European, American and Aus-
tralian Labor movements had been to produce a type
of working-man who had no survival value,“ as
against the colored races, and but for protection
of an extremist form, namely, the prohibition of
immigration, would soon be swept out of existence.
That protection rested entirely on an armed force.
The white working-man to-day was dreaming of
fresh rewards, doles and privileges which were to
make the white countries a paradise for his class,
yet all the time he was living in sufferance behind
an artificial dyke, the ironclads and bayonets on the
other side being- far more efficient than the colored
labor mass, which would eat him up in a generation
if the barrier was removed.
It hasn’t taken an English clergyman to
teach the democracy of Australia that great
truth. If the objects of the King and Em-
pire Alliance are what its name implies, it
is as superfluous as was the now deceased
British Empire League of Australia. If the
members are out to stop disloyalty they may
safely desist and turn to some form of pro-
ductive work instead ; for there is not enough
of the genuine article flaming in this country
to light a match.
» • » «
Of course the organisers of the Alliance
know that their concern rests broad-based
on the same fallacy as the. Sydney institu-
tion which escaped from York-street and
ended up in the Tivoli Theatre years ago.
It is not designed to weld the Empire
together. . On the contrary, it will act as
a disruptive force, doing its best, as its prede-
cessor consistently did, to set race against
race, class against class, and sect against
sect. The politicians associated with it will
see to that. They know that the average voter
rarely fights his way to the polling-booth on
behalf of an ideal, but often on account
of hostility to one. Most men are cold
about Brown, the Mothers’ Endowment en-
thusiast, or Smith, the Proportional Repre-
sentation Champion, but for Brown, the
anti-Sinn Feiner, or Smith, the po’lysyl-
labic assailant of a set of individuals bearing
the tab “disloyalist.” the stream of approval
runs high and strong. The N. S Wales
Parliament has always contained dozens of
men with no other claims to political con-
sideration than a self-righteous disdain of
people i abe i led “dangerous,” “disaffected”
~ imi,„ „ h . ’ ~ , h , C
. ’• Ihe cohesion of the elect on
| ae basis ot hatred of the unjust is their
idea. They have learned to rule the tem-
P of slander, Pharisaical rebuke and
™endo and direct the storm; and it is
Lever their fault if the business omits to
pay a d i vic i encl in the form of a geat in
Parliament, or a job, or a title. It didn’t
matter so much in the pre-war period, when
nerves were better, and the wheels of
smoothly; but nowadays
every agency which tends to create ill-feeling
is undesirable. Of course the prospect is
not all dark. As against the community’s
increased readiness to become exasperated,
there is its added perceptiveness; more par-
ticularly in respect of the frauds who used
patriotism so industriously for the purpose
of lining their pockets and advancing them-
selves in other ways throughout the war.
The second factor is likely to be a serious
obstacle in the path of the new Alliance.
THE PROPOSED MOBILISATION OF
627,685 REVOLUTIONARIES.
There has been held at Melbourne an All-
Australian Conference of trades unions and
trades and labor councils. It wasn’t quite
All Australian, but it was a colorable imita-
tion. Proceedings were shorter than usual:
either the majority lost their mental balance
or they weakly allowed a mad minority of
the congregation to take charge. The dele-
gates dispersed to form a minority Govern-
ment and Parliament elected by methods not
very well defined, but representing trades
unions only. Or, rather, they are to repre-
sent the dominant section in the unions,
whether its dominance be due to numbers or
to energy or to the supineness of the rank
and file. The unions in each State are to
be “linked” in 12 groups, like the 12 apostles
or the 12 months of the year or the 12 signs
of the Zodiac. These minor Soviets or
Electoral Colleges are to come together
and elect a State Council of Action con-
sisting of a president, a secretary and a
Ministry of 12, one from each group or
soviet of unions. And the seven State Coun-
cils of Action are to elect a Federal Council
of Action, or, rather, Council of Destruction,
for its purpose is not to straighten the
finances, attract more population, build new
towns, settle new lands and build up new
industries, but rather to destroy the exist-
ing order of things, with no assurance that
any order of any sort will be invented to
replace it.
The proposition isn’t democratic in any
sense. The constituency which is supposed
to choose, the 12 Electoral Colleges is to
consist of the 627,685 trades unionists
(Knibbs’s latest available figures), which
is a very small and narrow constituency
compared with about 2,900,000 Federal elec-
tors. How far the Electoral Colleges are
to be the free choice of this small body,
arrived at by secret ballot with independent
scrutineers and all the other paraphernalia
which makes for independent judgment, isn’t
known. With the creation of the State
Soviet Revolutionary Parliament the hand-
ful of electors are to have nothing to do
save at second hand. With the creation of
the Federal Soviet or Grand Revolutionary
Convention, they are to have nothing to do
save at third hand. As for the other
2,300,000 or so Federal electors, they are to
have no connection with the establishment
of the new Government, even at one-hun-
dredth hand. If the new Government is to
do nothing, then nothing matters. But if
it proposes to do big things and be a real
ruling force, the gigantic disfranchisement
is one of the prize shocks of history. And
apparently the great interlocked Soviet does
propose to do things. With the aid of its
600,000 followers, it is to have power:—
- To organise forces to take charge and regulate the
food necessary for the working class to live. (So
presumably it is to take possession of all food, and
after its followers have used what they want and a
vast amount has been wasted in the confusion, the
other three-fourths of the community will have such
crumbs as remain.)
To order a cessation of work.
To take any action deemed necessary—which is
a permit wide enough to cover every crime in the
calendar or out of it.
* * * *
When anybody mobilises 627,685 troops
on the border, or mobilises a force of un-
known numbers which he alleges to amount
to 627,685, it is customary for any Govern-
ment worthy of the name to do something
strenuous by way of precaution. .This is
done even if the opponent is a despised sort
of enemy. If he announces that he is bent
on war, and not even on ordinary war but
on permanent conquest with the destruction
of local institutions and self-governing rights
and the seizure of all property, it usually
happens that the threatened party decides
not to wait in suspense for the assailant’s
convenience, but to rush his position and do
either a great slaying or a great scattering.
At the first sign of trouble he also puts sup-
posed adherents of the foe under close super-
vision if not in close confinement. The situa-
tion as regards the force which Garden,
Graves, Walsh and co. profess to command
differs from all this, chiefly because it con-
sists of traitors to Australian self-govern-
ment inside the country—not ordinary
enemies outside. It poses or is posed as a
class apart from the nation as represented


by its ruling majority—as much apart as if
it consisted of Germans or Japanese. It
declares itself to be powerful, implacable
and not even bound by the ordinary rules
and courtesies of Avar, but at liberty to take
any action that its non-representative Par-
liament may “deem necessary.” The least
that should be done is to take the names of
the members of the 12 ReA'olutionary Elec-
toral Colleges in each State, the seven Re-
A r olutiouar.y State Parliaments and the one
big ReA'olutionary Federal Parliament and
disqualify them permanently as municipal,
State and Federal A'oters and members. No
man should belong to tAvo Parliaments at
once, and if he is part of a Legislature of
re\ r olt which is so exclusive that it shuts out
nearly three-fourths of the people, he should
be content with that proud and separatist
position. He shouldn’t be a pluralist or a
spy in the majority’s camp. If he proposes
to attack the Constitution, and if the majo-
rity proposes to passively await the attack,
he should at least be made to assail the
people’s castle from without, not “Avhite ant”
it from within.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Post-War Slump.
Referring to the growth of unemployment
in Sydney a Nationalist M.L.A. remarked
last week, with a sort of gloomy triumph,
that for every hundred now jobless there
would be a thousand out of work in the win-
ter. In the chivalrous fashion of his tribe
he implied that it would be the fault of the
Storey Government. The Storey Govern-
ment, of course, repudiates the vile calumny.
Its attitude is that if any labor surplus exists
(which is not admitted) llolman caused it.
and that if the surplus increases Holman
will be to blame for that, too. Another
theory, popular among the Red Feds., is that
the whole thing is the result of “a capitalist
conspiracy.” This view of the case impressed
itself on a conference of union secretaries
from all the States except Queensland, and
the delegates dispersed declaring that the
obvious remedy for unemployment is more
unemployment, and that “the time for battle
(i.e., a general strike) is now.” Unfortu-
nately there are industrialists who believe
this demented nonsense, just as there are
Nationalists who blame Storey for the pre-
sent industrial situation and Laborists who
put it all down to llolman. Bemused by the
piffle of party politicians and by the virulent
sophistries of doctrinaires of the Garden
school, they are blind to what is happening
on the. other side of the world. Australia
is having a foretaste of the universal and
now inevitable post-war slump. Its sufferings
are mild compared to those of Britain, where,
at the latest computation, 1,250,000 persons
were on the unemployed list, and it is an
industrial paradise by contrast with France,
Italy, Spain (where the Bank of Barcelona
broke recently), Holland and Czecho-
slovakia, to say nothing of Soviet Russia,
The T. J. Ryan school of politicians is fond
of asserting that Canada made money out of
the war. Yet this is the position in Canada
(or was a month ago), according to the
Canadian correspondent of London Daily
News :
Canada is faced with a very serious unemploy-
ment problem. In all the industrial centres there is a
daily growing contingent of workless. The situation
in British Columbia is most serious of all. A large
proportion of the unemployed are ex-soldiers. The
Federal and Provincial Governments and the munici-
pal authorities are working out a joint scheme, of
which each will bear one-third of the cost, for the
mitigation of the situation, and all save a few
limited classes of emigrants, immediately capable of
farm work, will be barred from Canada for three
months unless they can show themselves possessed
of 250d015., which is equivalent to £6O.
And conditions in the U.S.A. are worse than
they are in Canada. According to a conser-
vative estimate there were 2,300,000 Ameri-
cans out of work last month, and the num-
ber seems to be growing larger instead of
smaller. At all events, the Trade Commis-
sioner has been moved to cable that his office
is besieged by stranded Australians demand-
ing to be helped back to their own country,
and the gentleman added that New York,
from the work-seeker’s point of view, is a
splendid place to keep away from. That
loan-drunk, strike-distracted Australia will
escape the slump that lias hit Canada, Brit-
ain, the U.S.A. and every other belligerent
is. improbable on the face of it. In the
critical times through which the world is
passing slump is in the natural order of
events, and only a miracle or a supreme
effort on the part of the nation could avert
it. The age of miracles has vanished, and
there has been no supreme effort on the part
of the nation—nothing but a flood of paper
money, an orgy of high living, an epi-
demic of party warfare and a succession of
disastrous strikes.
Australia’s Ireland.
Every country of any standing has an Ire-
land or two nowadays. The possession of
one or more of these infuriated—justlv in-
furiated —regions is getting to be a measure
of the owner’s worldly importance, like a
peeress’s diamonds. In the front row of the
stalls sits Britannia resplendent with India,
Egypt, Erin, Mesopotamia and sundries.
Japan boasts Kiao-Chau, Korea and For-
mosa: and America makes a fair showing
with Hawaii and the Philippines. France,
in Syria and Tunis, and Italy in Tripoli and
on the Adriatic littoral, which formerly
belonged to Austria, stand out proudly, and
even the Commonwealth makes its humble
bid for a position in the charmed circle with
the Northern Territory. The Territory
is a paltry place by comparison, say, with
Poland, when the latter had 13,000,000 in-
habitants under the knout of Russia and
another 7,000,000 under the German-Aus-
trian jackboot. There are now only about
3000 persons to nurse their grievances in
the whole of the Territory’s 523,620 square
mile lhnn I ? ree yeai ? ago there were close
on SWU, but, as always happens in such
places, emigration is extensive and per-
sistent. However, the population question
apart, conditions are not essentially dif-
ferent from those in any other helot ‘State.
The two things that every communitv which
is culturally above the coolie level fears are
(1) taxation without adequate representa-
tion; (2) government by regulation. Porto
Rico, which is 40 per cent, black, has re-
presentative government of a sort, and the
Philippines may actually elect Commis-
sioners to the U.S. House of Representatives
who can lay the archipelago’s needs and
grievances before members, though without
the right to vote. The people of the Terri-
tory have no representation whatever.
They are dumb; no Roman colony in the
days of Domitian was more so. By
way of protest a number of them
recently passed a resolution not to pay any
more Federal taxes till their wrongs were
adjusted. There was no justification for
this excursion into the regions of direct
action, but still less was there for the
action of the Government officials who
arrested one of the memorialists when he
attempted to go south without disgorging.
The conditions under which summary arrest
for debt are permissible in some parts of
Australia appear in the Statute Books, and
they do not apply to citizens who are merely
travelling from one part of the Common-
wealth to the other. However, in the Terri-
tory any autocratic official action is legal,
since officialdom owns the police and is
responsible to no one. As always happens
in such cases —it is obviously so in Ireland
at the present time, and it was always so
in Russian Poland under the Czarist regime
—the police also own officialdom, more
particularly in the districts remote from
civilisation, and much of the Territory comes
under that heading. And wherever the police
own the higher officials in however small a
degree there is oppression and blackmail,
bribery and corruption, and their con-
comitants assaults and even murders. There
is no valid reason why the Northern Terri-
tory shouldn’t have a non-voting spokesman
either in the Reps, or the Senate. It is not
his vote that is wanted so much as his voice.
But a voice shouting vigorous remarks in
Hansard and the newspapers about Aus-
tralia’s undeveloped North is the last thing
the city politicians desire to hear. The
ideal, as one of them put it the other day,
is that the Territory, its dissatisfied inhabi-
tants and its expensive problems should be
tipped into the sea.

The Dooley Government’s Writing-off.
A heroic scheme of camouflage is proposed
with regard to the Murrumbidgee (N.S.W.)
irrigation settlement. In N.S.W. irrigation
was a public enterprise, started in the later
days of political debasement, when the pla-
cating of voters came first and the supply
of water a long, long way behind. Dragging
at its heels the ball and chain of debt, and
carrying on its back a whole Circumlocution
Office of employees, the irrigation movement
changed a bit of the State from a place that
yielded revenue to one which costs £284,000
a year to maintain. The “Official Year-
Book” says of it: “When fully developed
it is estimated that there will be over 200,000
acres under irrigation,” so the loss would be
£1 Bs. sd. per acre per annum if the work
was complete. It is more per acre just now
and the Dooley Government has decided to
take the calamity in hand. Amid a number
of vague and uncertain schemes the concrete
proposal stands out to write off £3,000,000,
or half the capital as lost. This writing off
would be by far the best thing possible, and
one of the most upstanding acts of any State
Government for 50 years past —if it was
straightforwardly done. Of course that is
not the intention. The £3.000,000 isn’t to be
paid off. The idea is to conceal it in another
account among the general debt. The inter-
est will still have to be paid, and as the debt
falls due and is renewed at higher rates,
more interest will have to be paid. Posterity
will get a £3,000,000 asset with a £6,000,000
debt on it just the same, but the suppression
of fact in the balance-sheet will tend to make
it think it is getting full value. There will
be much Congratulation when the concern
appears to begin to pay, though., as a matter
of fact it won’t be paying even when it shows
£lOO,OOO a year alleged profit. Banks act
differently, either from policy or because
bankers have more courage and a higher
standard of morality. Many Australian
banks made losses in the nineties of last
century—indeed, one found itself faced with
a bigger loss than N. S. Wales experienced
in the Murrumbidgee. Yet, without the
national taxpayer to fall back upon the pro-
blems were faced. When capital was lost
the shareholders paid it off. All interest
in it ceased for ever. It was taken out of
the balance-sheet and buried —not put into
another account under a false name; and
some of these institutions look and feel
younger and better than ever because they
have interred the past and don’t carry the
corpse about with them. But the States
look 40 years older than they did 27 years
ago, because their rulers have always been
too cowardly to clean up. It really doesn’t
matter much that N.S.W. has dropped
£3,000,000 on the Murrumbidgee, though it
was either a corrupt thing or a foolish and in-
competent thing to do, If the money hadn’t
vanished there it might have gone in wild
cats or horse-racing, or drink, or in leading
the double wife. It doesn’t matter provided
the thing is~ paid and the past is lightly
wiped out and life starts afresh. Losses
treated that way are merely an experience
-—sometimes a jest. The crime and the
tragedy occur when a financial blunder is
transformed into still another iron ball
attached to the lengthening chaip that the
community must drag at its heel for ever and
ever. And this is the offence of Dooley.
+
The Growing Popularity of Direct
Action.
Judge Curlewis, of N. S. Wales, sitting
in Arbitration last week fined the Furniture
Trades Society £lOO and ordered it to pay
45 guineas costs for participating in an
illegal strike. The trouble originated in the
shop of Walter Lord, master furniture-
maker. Two of Lord’s polishers objected to
a third —one Gill —for working too fast, and
failing to get him sacked, left themselves.
The rest of the story is largely a tally of the
devices invented and employed by the Furni-
ture bosses to ruin Lord for sticking to Gill.
The Union convinced Lord in time that
while he had Gill its agents could and would
prevent him getting any other polishers, so
the worker whose sole crime was a disincli-
nation to go slow was regretfully given his
walking ticket. Lord then got all the men
he wanted. The N. S. Wales members of
the Federal Parliament propose to employ
the same form of blackmail in connection
with the Canberra question. Their idea is
to organise lightning strikes of M’s.P. ex-
tending over a week or more, and so, by
depriving the Government of a quorum, make
it impossible for the nation’s business to be
carried on. It is a bright notion in.its way.
That is to say, it is likely to be efficacious,
since there is nothing the present Federal
Government desires less than to be driven
out of office with some of the fattest billets
in the history of the country in process of
allocation. And there is no danger of legal
punishment as in the case of unionists. On
the other hand, the proposed action of the
Parliamentarians is infinitely more repre-
hensible than that of any illegal striker. The
striker draws no pay from the moment he
downs tools: the men who have just un-
authorisedly raised their salaries are not the
sort to return their stipends to the Govern-
ment Avhile they are out against it, or to
forego their free railway passes or other
perquisites. The striking unionist creates
no dangerous precedent. The Sydney poli-
ticians who exploit direct action in the
interests of Canberra to-day may find to-
morrow a Melbourne clique doing the same
thing on behalf of some wild-cat Victorian
scheme, or an Orange Lodge section clamor-
ing for the deportation of all Romanists, or
a band of Hibernians insisting on the abo-
lition of Freemasonry. Government is unre-
presentative enough already in all conscience.
The electors have so little real choice in the
matter of their members that the N. S.
Wales papers have been canvassing for weeks
past the various identities to whom the
Parramatta seat is to be “given” by Mr.
Hughes in the event of Joseph Cook taking
the High Commissionership. Senator Prat-
ten, the present favorite for the constitu-
ency, may have to give way to Senator
Millen ; but, if he is required to, Mr.
Hughes will give Senator Pratten some-
body else’s seat. All without reference to
those most affected. And it is not out of
place that it should be so, since once in
Parliament such absurdly unrepresentative
representatives get their orders and have no
choice but to obey. However, under the
existing arrangement, there is at least a
central authority on whom responsibility
can be fixed, and a general policy to which the
country has given some sort of endorsement.
’With the threatened grafting of the Soviet
system on to Constitutional Government the
people will lose the last hold they possess
over Parliament. It will be the sole example
in the Commonwealth of job control which
is entirely immune from Court control.
Giving the Wazzir the Franchise.
The Milner Mission has recommended the
granting of complete independence to Egypt,
subject to one or two trifling provisos de-
signed to safeguard . the interests of resi-
dent British subjects. The Mission was
inspired, inasmuch as the Government knew
what it was going tp get before the evidence
was sought, and, indeed, could have secured
better expert testimony from one of its
many military advisers who have spent more
years in the country than the members of
the Mission did weeks. The most interest-
ing feature of the business is the sidelight,
it casts on the Irish question. No better
proof is needed of the charge which grows
and grows that the good name of England
is being besmirched in Ireland on a Party
issue. It is true that Egypt was promised
self-determination during the war—and be-
fore it. But so was Ireland. The strategic
situation of Ireland was formerly used as
an argument against separation, though it
has never been so dangerous geographically
to England as Belgium, Holland and the
Channel coast of France, as far west as
Brest. Nowadays—visibility on the high
seas having been increased a thousand-fold
by aircraft —Erin couldn’t receive, much less
entertain, an enemy of Britain if it wanted
to; and, indeed, there is no imaginable
reason why a free Ireland should wish to
injure those who must remain its best cus-
tomers for as long a k s the two countries
engage in commerce. Egypt, on the other
hand, is the strategic' centre of the British
Empire. Any mishap to the Canal would
isolate India and the East, and Cairo is the
junction from which radiate all those roads
along which the Bolshevists threaten to
make their proselytising marches. Ireland
can never be invaded by any nation but
England while the British keep command of
the seas. The Egyptians would probably
put up a poor fight against the Arabs,
who, ousted from Syria by the French,
are lusting for conquest elsewhere; and it
is absolutely certain that, faced with another
Mahdist invasion, the country would be over-
whelmed. The Gyppo never has considered
himself the equal in combat of the Soudan-
ese, and there is no doubt about the correct-
ness of the estimate. Australians of the pre-
war epoch were liable to be deceived over
matters of this kind. But in the last half-
dozen years half a million of them have tra-
velled and observed. Fully 50 per cent, of
our Army saw the Egyptian in his habit as
he lived, and returned home with a profound
conviction that in morals, cleanliness,
decency, courage and most of the other quali-
ties that count, the despised abo. was his
master. If it can be established that Irish-
men are lower in the ethnological scale than
the dusky degenerates whom the Diggers
encountered at Cairo, Alexandria and else-
where, and, further, that Ireland is more
likely to be seized and used inimically to
the Empire than Egypt, then there is a logi-
cal, if not moral, justification for keeping
the place in subjection. But such proposi-
tions are absurd, and there remains only the
conclusion that, in this connection, the Tory
tail (represented by Edward Carson) is
wagging the entire Coalition dog.
The End of a Jazz.
War and war prices, a flush of grass in 1916-
17, a few keen speculators—from these con-
flicting elements was evolved Queensland’s
beef jazz. Now it is all over and, as usual,
somebody has to pay for the supper, the shoe-
leather, the taxi-cabs and the drinks. It
was in 1916 that things began to move. Sud-
denly but steadily the prices for stores and
weaners and poddy calves took an upward
leap. Stock sales, like mushrooms, grew
almost in a night. Weekly, fortnightly, or
monthly sales were organised in most of
Bananaland’s south-eastern towns. Any-
thing and everything became saleable. Mon-
grel-beaded, weak-bodied, many-colored and
indifferent calves went at £3 and £4, miserable
weaners fetched £6, and stores soared above
£lO per bead. The animals were sold, not
to legitimate farmers and graziers, but to
dealers who, descending locust-like upon the
land, travelled them from one sale to an-
other, Quitting whenever they could realise
a profit of a few shillings per head. Gradu-
ally, and at their highest prices, many of
these useless creatures were unloaded on
unsophisticated innocents with grass. Then
came the 1918 drought. During this drought
less were lost than might have been expected.
This was not an unmixed blessing ; there are
now many men who still hold large numbers
of stock which were so expensive as two-
year-olds and weaners that there is little
likelihood of them ever being got rid of at a
profit. Were this the only trouble it might
be looked on with indifference, since each
gambler has to learn by his losses. But it
is unfortunately only the beginning. Beef
is now down and is likely to remain so.
Female stock are practically unsaleable.
Certainly the low-grade females bought dur-
ing the gamble are unsaleable, except at a
great loss. Yet of necessity they have to
be retained and bred from. It is a set-back
to the quality of Queensland’s stock, repre-
senting probably a 10- or 12-years’ penalty
for a two-years’ razzle. It is not surprising
that the cocky should be called on to pay
the piper. It is usual for the fool to have
to foot the bill after a spree. But it is
curious to find how little real attention the
alleged shrewd city dweller gives to the con-
ditions which directly control his cost of
living.

The Curse of the Boy Ruler.
"This is the age of young men,” was the
burden of a recent Melbourne Age article.
It has been the burden of many articles, for
in a sense, of course, every age has been
the age of young men. Cain, according to
the guidebook of the period, built the city
of Baalbec 33 years after Creation, so he
can hardly have been over 31. He conducted
his successful campaign against Abel earlier
than that. Alexander, the prize child-bore
and boy-nuisance of history, was 22 when
he began war on his own account, and 33
when he died, having so effectively used up
the resources of a robust kingdom that it
never looked up again, and all this for an
empire which had no cohesion and which
died with him. Charles IX. was 22 when
he drifted into the massacre of St. Barthol-
omew. Henry HI. became king at 23, and
made France a ruin and very tired of young
kings. Solomon was the young king who
married too many wives, and Reiioboam
the one who lost an empire right off, and
Nero was the 17-year-old Cfesar who lost
most of his Christians, and Mary Stuart
was the young queen who mislaid her third
husband at the age of 25. In fact, history
is blotted with unballasted rulers who began
too young, and they have been far worse
than the rulers who didn’t stop until they
were too old. Quite apart from the fact that
N.S.W. Attorney-General McTiernan began
to reign at the age of 28, and is the sort
who never reigns but he pours, Australia
is suffering from quite too many boy-kings.
Most of its erratic history is made now,
not by legislators but by strikers and strike-
leaders who, in addition to doing a lot of
direct government, also to a great extent
make the legislators. The industrial record
of a country is at least as important as
its law-making record. Australia’s indus-
trial career depends to a remarkable extent
on the Newcastle-Maitland coalfield, which
supplies more than half the nation’s fuel and
also more than half the influence which per-
mits or stops the fuel supply. And Newcastle
is ruled altogether too much by the wheelers
in the coalpits, boys of 14 and upwards,
who leave off work at one or more mines
every day of the week for purely frisky rea-
sons, whereupon everybody else leaves off.
They are members of the union with a voice
in its affairs, which the unionist’s wife or
the wheeler’s mother doesn’t possess, though
she has to bear the heat and burden of the
struggle when the strike eventuates. In Par-
liamentary legislation the wife of the male
elector was long since promoted to a vote,
though his under-aged boy wasn’t. In union
legislation, which affects the working family
much more, the hard-worked mother of the
nation, about whom Ministers of the
McGirr, McTiernan and Sproule type
enthuse exceedingly, is shut out while the
irresponsible boy is let in. One of the aims
of 0.8. U.-ism is to confer the suffrage on
the under-aged, so that Parliamentary legis-
lation may also be run on coal-pit-boy-
wheeler lines. Then Australia would indeed
be the land whose king is a child, and often
an unemployable child with no fixed occu-
pation. There is nothing like youth—in a
kindergarten, or a cricket field, or under the
mistletoe. But in those places where sober-
thinking is done and big decisions arrived at
it is a misfortune and a peril, not to say
an accursed pest.
Another Shock for Israel.
Something that closely resembled a curse
went round the part of London where
N.S.W. cadges for fresh loans and tries to
renew old ones, when the news was cabled
that Minister Lougiilin’s Land Bill is to
be re-introduced next session, possibly in a
slightly more violent form than the original.
England’s land interests, mostly through
banks and pastoral companies, have a iot.
to do with big estates. These are to be put
under a sort of suspended death sentence
which will reduce their value by one-half,
unless faith in the prompt obliteration of
the Storey Cabinet and its works prevents
the ban having full effect. This is because:
All improvements made after 1920 are marked for
confiscation, so improvement will cease and dilapi-
dation and loss of revenue set in as they did under
Turkish rule in Palestine.
All unearned increment accruing after 1920 will
be confiscated, so whatever present value is based
on the hope of a rise will vanish.
During the period of waiting for the State to
take over property all sales will be illegal except by
permission of the fitful and uncertain Minister —and
some day there may be a Minister who is mercenary
as well as fitful. So the land will cease to ‘be 'a

This kind of legislation would stagger land

When a large number of men are under
suspended death sentence they are sure to
deteriorate, even if few are really executed.
The financial section of London has three
complaints: (1) About the depreciation of
its property; (2) about the very dubious
currency in which that depreciated value is
to be paid for; (3) about the depreciation
of its great swag of N.S.W. securities if the
issue is to be increased, not merely by ordi-
nary loans, but by the issue of bonds in
payment for land, lottery prizes and sun-
dries. Then this rackety, helter-skelter
style of finance causes thought, for a Gov-
ernment which, buys back its own land titles

but buy them up, paying for them with worse

shown an entirely new point by a three-
card trick-man; nor is there anything re-
markable about his gloom in the circum-
stances.
The Chronic Trouble on the
Murrumbidgee.
The lamentable condition of N. S. Wales’s
Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme promises
to lead to one of those inquiries which, don’t
end up anywhere, because the road is
blocked. Irrigation is supposed to make
those who go in for it rich, and at Mildura
fVic.) and lienmark (S.A.) it has done so.
It only seems to make N. S. Wales poor, the
loss last year being £284,567. An aggrava-
tion of the ease is that the deficit grows worse
as time «-oes on. The more the desert blos-
soms like the rose the more the Treasury
has cause to wish it had not taken to horti-
culture, for the blossom is a bad debt. In
addition to the huge losses —which are bad
and will be worse as the old cheap loans
fall due for renewal—the audit department
says things about the slovenliness of the
management which would cover a private
concern with shame and liquidation. The
Murrumbidgee settlement is no infant, for it
has been growing things for eight years. It
has lived all its days under Labor govern-
ment, for Holman got all his training in the
school of the wasters who acquired office
in 1910 on what was almost a no-borrowing
ticket, and then began to play the part of
Itechabites in liquor. When it was under
construction the first consideration was to
give the largest possible number of em-
ployees ''men of the right political color) a
pleasant time. In fact, the big reservoir
was exploited more to catch votes than
water. In addition, of course, a party
which is mostly union secretaries, organisers,
youthful lawyers and school-teachers, with an
odd house agent or small shopkeeper here and
there, has less chance, however good its
intentions mav be, to produce the kind of
man who knows how to handle big enterprises
without dropping millions into holes than
one which occasionally captures as portfolio-
holders notable engineers, shipowners,
bankers and manufacturers. State Govern-
ments become more and more gigantic fac-
tories and universal provideries dealing in
almost everything and attempting almost
every kind of work under the sun. Then-
theoretical and rhetorical character is. or
should be, about 12| per cent., and their
hard, business instinct 874 per cent. But
thanks to machine politics and other things
the typical Minister in charge of the factory
and providery is now the glib, galvanic
young man who will never grow up
—a person with the leaping sickness, who
can make a passionate address from a pub
balcony, but could not possibly make a suc-
cess of the pub. In the days when N. S.
Wales was solvent, and finances were easy to
manage. Treasurers were men like See, the
big .shipowner, or Garvan, the founder ,of a
great life assurance office. Now, when the
country is overwhelmed with vast deficits,
and all manner of troubles, its money affairs
are in the hands of Lang, the suburban
house agent. Edmund Barton, barrister,
man of travel, and nation-builder, finds his
successor in McTiernan. The new men
are no more laboring and no more horny-
handed than the old ones. On the other
hand, they are smaller men, because they are
the sort who don’t mind being subservient to
the machine, and things are bad in the fac-
tory and universal providery as a conse-
quence.
A brief review of the finances of the
moment
The Queensland £2,000,000 64 per cent, local
paper loan failed just as its £9,000,000 gold loan
failed in London, so the time was extended. How
much it failed for no one knows at time of writing.
The million which Theodore raised in London for
one year to pay interest with is getting nearly due,
and towards meeting it Theodore and co. had, at
the end of January, a deficit of £850,212, one or
two strikes and a quantity of blasted hopes. At
the same time last year the deficit was £809,176, so,
despite about £900,000 more revenue things are
£41,000 worse. ...
In N. S. Wales the £3,000,000 54 per cent, paper
loan failed, and the term was extended. Final
results are at present unknown. Despite an increase
of £1,366,518 in revenue the shortage for the
seven months was £3,518,270, which is £1,275,123
worse than under Holman at the same time last
year. Loan expenditure was £8,895,960, or at the
rate of over £15,000,000 a year, but still the unem-
ployed are multiplying
Westralia, which was rather uplifted because for
one month the accounts squared, is on the down-
grade again: Deficit for the seven months was
£683,982, and total deficit, all caused by absurdly
low taxation, £4,770,686. This comes under the
heading of insolvency by malice aforethought....
The Commonwealth has persuaded the British Gov-
ei-nment to take long-dated bonds for £90,000,000
of old debts. The interest is from 34 to 5 per
cent., which is very like the figure a dismayed credi-
tor accepts when a debtor says: “Well, I can’t pay
more and you’ve no security. Take it or I’ll burst
and you’ll get less or nothing.” In addition the
Federal Government is borrowing from a most re-
luctant Bull £5,000,000 at 6 per cent., getting £95
for every £lOO. Some mystery envelops these trans-
actions, but there is a suspicion that quite a deal
of this borrowed gold is to pay interest on loans in

“Mubkah”: “Pact” (B. 10/2/’2l) is right
in suggesting that the radio-gear on Austra-
lian and M.L. ships .should be brought up to
date and the range increased. It is a dan-
gerous fact that, between strikes, there are
ships wandering around our coasts with
wireless apparatus that was out of date 14
years ago, and which in time of stress would,
10 chances to one, be useless. The same
remarks apply to some of the largest British-
registered vessels that trade to Australia.
I do not suggest, in these days of win-the-
peace prices, that the present apparatus be
scrapped. But the addition of approxi-
mately £4O worth of gear would improve it
out of sight. For instance, as now con-
stituted, the range of ship-wireless, under
good conditions, is about 100 miles by day
and 500 by night. The addition of a pair
of valves across the transformer, and one or
two other odds and ends would give a con-
tinuous wave system, with a range, night
and day, any conditions, of at least 500
miles. Obviously Australia could then have
a real daylight chain, with about half the
stations that provide the broken-linked theory
oUto-day. But there is one condition —the
coast stations would also have to be im-
proved. The same method would do. As
a proof of our lack of progress, the departing
American steamers Sonoma and Ventura,
using a sk.w. continuous wave system, can
throw messages into Sydney Radio (Carling-
ford t long "after that station, with 40k.w.
and a 400 ft. aerial to fling it from, can
reach them with an acknowledgment. The
incoming steamer, when it comes withir
range of Sydney’s antiquated spark—a mere
thousand miles or so —adjusts matters, giv-
ing repeats if required. Then, without diffi-
culty. he “goes to” his brother, now ap-
proaching the Golden Gate, and informs him
how he fared, occasionally relaying a mes-
sage from Australia. My proposal suggests
a cheap method of achieving some of this
splendid efficiency.
A few words concerning luck: —
Consider the spasmodic nature of thing’s—-the fits
and starts, also the moods and tenses. In its early
days, when the sun was rising and all the world
was young, the Government of N. S. Wales guaran-
teed the wheat farmers 2s. 6d. per bushel over and
above the ss. of the Federal guarantee. It was
spontaneous generosity and well meant, though no
money has eventuated, and the Government no more
knows how to find money than it knows how to
put salt on the tail of Briggs’s comet.
In the spell of reaction or cold feet which ensued
the N.S.W. milk farmer was put on a rather dif-
ferent basis. lie was treated as a capitalist and
cruel profiteer. He has to supply the Sydney market
with buttex at a lower rate than he could get
abroad, which may be all right, though it makes
him realise that if secession from the big city could
be arranged, and new States established, then he
could sell to the city at market rates, and it could
no longer commandeer his cow-grease at its own
price, as Rome used to commandeer the grain of
Egypt. Then, just when the wheat person’s State
bonus of 2s. 6d. (50 per cent, added to the Federal
guarantee) was falling due, and he was being told
that he might get 6 per cent, bonds for it with luck,
the milk person got a different kind of present. He
was told that his price was reduced about 23 per-
cent. So his idea is that he is the victim of
time, circumstances and the spasmodic frame of
mind. In other words, he thinks that if he had
come under notice when the bright young Cabinet
■was in the song-and-dance stage of its career he
might have been guaranteed a big figure for his
whole year’s cow-crop. At the same time the wheat-
man, arriving later when the Ministry was disillu-
sionised and jaundiced, might have been told that
he was a blastiferous profiteer, and that 4s. a
bushel was too good for the likes of him.
Yet, as producers, exporters, great natural resources
and backbones of the country, the cow-man and
wheat-man are Tweedledum and Tweedledee. It
seems to have been a mere toss up which should
be cast for the thankless part of Tweedledee.

“J.C.” on Usury, Public and Private:—
The N. S. Wales Railway Department makes a
charge of sd. for every article left in its cloak-
rooms for a period of 24 hours, and a slightly
smaller impost for every subsequent period of equal
length. The Private Enterprise Ferry Companies
render a similar service for 3d. Meanwhile the pro-
fessional Shylock, who pays a license for the privi-
lege of bleeding the community, will store his
fellow-man’s suitcase for a month, lend him 10s.
on it, and return it at the end of that period, or
any portion of it, for 3d., plus the sum loaned.
But then the railways belong to the people, and the
people collectively is an ass. It never thinks of
kicking when a public utility makes a profit of 50
or 100 per cent, out of it. It remains unmoved
when it sees the motor-’bus underselling its trams
and beating them for speed; and only experiences
mild wonderment when, now and again, Bullocky
Bill matches his team against the goods train,
and beats it, too, in the matter of price. In fact,
the public generally has lost sight of the fact that
a Government-owned utility has no right to show
a dividend in excess of a reasonable 'sinking-fund—
such a concern, where it engages in profiteering,
representing the perpetuation of the very iniquity
it was brought into existence to blot out.
■■■— ♦ —-
More about Queensland’s basic wage:—
Following on the finding of the Arbitration Court
that Southern Queensland’s basic wage Should be
£4 ss. per week, the builders’ employees have filed
an application for a 10 per cent, increase in their
wages. This because their last award, made just
over a month ago, was based on a wage of £3 17s.
Now, when the Arbitration Court made this finding
it reckoned that a man would draw his four
- pounds or six pounds per week — every week
of the year. But this was where the catch
in an otherwise infallible system comes in.
Take the position of the building trade. As a result
of any further wage-increase Mr. Blank is extremely
likely to make up his mind to wait before he builds
his new house. Or he may drop the idea altogether.
Messrs. Blank will simultaneously abandon their
previous intention of extending their factory. The
result is carpenters, bricklayers, painters and
laborers who would otherwise have got work are
liable to find themselves idle.
At the best these men have to be satisfied with a week’s
work here and a day’s work there, and then a spell of
a few weeks while they are looking for jobs. But their
butcher’s bills still come in every week, and the
kiddies’ shoes continue to wear out, and all the
little odds and ends that man has to pay for the
right of living, still go on. This explains why the
trade gazettes have such long lists of bills of sale
effected by Ikeymo and Sons on the workers’ furni-
ture and , his wife’s sewing-machine. The toiler
must find the cash for his never-ending household
expenses, and so he pops his goods and chattels,
hoping for the brighter times which don’t come.
It will not be much use for the Arbitration Court
to come forward with a new award. Its last one
killed scores of jobs, and the only thing to bring
them to life in the way of Court pronouncements
appears to be a revision of wages on the downward
scale —a line which the workers have themselves
taken in America. The higher the wage the scarcer
the job—never was there such a University for the
inculcation of this elementary law of industrialism
as the Queensland of to-day.
Wealsman :
The discipline of the Labor party is far from
being what it was. The writer heard a Labor mem-
ber complaining at an open-air meeting the other
day that a colleague, then present, had not been
chosen as official party leader. Four Labor Parlia-
mentarians followed, and all denounced the “dis-
loyalty” of those A.L.P. officials who, less than 100
yards away, were running a much larger “direct
action” meeting. And next day the Tory section
of the press praised the fine, courageous speeches of
the official Laborites—praise which the Reds will
auote at their next meeting in proof of the claim
that “Labor Parliamentarians are no good to the work-
ing class.” So the disputation continues, and the Pot
and Kettle go staggering down opposite sidewalks
flinging epithets at each other across the street and
impeding the traffic. Of course there always have
been strong differences between the various sections
of the Labor movement, and probably always will
be. The remarkable thing about the present squabble
is that the denunciatory Reds still remain members
of the Labor Leagues and the Labor .members are
not barred access to the Trades and Labor halls.
While there is occasional talk of enforcing discipline
by expulsions, for the most part it stops at talk.
Expulsions are apparently out of fashion in Labor
circles, though, according to former standards of
Labor right and wrong, they were never more neces-
sary. It may be that the possibility of obtaining better
results from free and open discussion than from
secret diplomacy and disciplinary restriction is
beginning to dawn on the organised wage-earners.
This seems a good deal to hope for, but, despite the
apparent bulk of the Garden, Lambert, Boote,
Theodore, Ryan, Dooley, Considine, Catts,
Brookfield sort of person in Labor’s councils, you
never can tell.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There is nothing sluggish about the ways
of Sydney City Council since the new Lord
Mayor hoisted his flag. Some days affairs
are especially brisk, and then one can hardly
see his Washup for dust. His Washup takes
his seat and then leaps to his feet and speaks
something like this: “Motion is that nobody
be employed by Council except militant paci-
fists (if there is any more interruption
everybody will be put out) ; that all Bol-
shevik employees have their wages raised;
that all returned soldiers be sacked and pro-
secuted (if order isn’t maintained the Town
Clerk will be put out, in addition to every-
body) ; that any number of new streets be
made at a cost not exceeding 16 millions,
and that 5 per cent, commission be paid for
supervision to a firm well and favorably
known to aldermen; that a quarry and a
coal-mine be bought (if there is any more
disturbance the furniture will be put out) ;
and that Alderman McWhizzle be suspended
under the Sunday Observance Act for the
rest of his natural life. Any alderman
objecting will be removed. Ayes 3, noes 10;
the ayes have it. This meeting is adjourned.
The lights will now be put out, there being
nothing else left.” It creates a dazed feel-
ing, and experienced traffic officers have
doubts about the speed limit.
The member of the British House of Com-
mons is paid £4OO a year for helping to run
an Empire, and especially to look after the
45 or 46 millions in the UJv. A proposal for
an increase has been turned down on the
ground that the country can’t afford it till
some of the debts are paid off. The Com-
monwealth pays £lOOO a year and N.S.W.
£875 with free rail and tram passes thrown
in. Yet twice as large a proportion of N. S.
Wales members, represent city and suburban
constituencies as British ones do, so they
have only a foot journey to travel and the
most outlying British constituency is as far
from London in a straight line as the Dar-
ling is from Sydney. Australia believes in
“doing the thing properly,” whoever pays.
“D. Tired” : “I’m not chasing it,” Gregory,
M.H.R. for Dampier, is reported to have
said when asked about the chairmanship of
the Country Party. It may be so, but I’m
game to bet there won’t be a wilder man in
Australia than Gregory if his fellow-Cockies
take him at his word. The little man from
the largest electorate in the world lias some
admirable qualities, but self-abnegation is not
one of them. As for his attributes of leader-
ship, he is pertinacious and a good hater, but
when you have said that you have said all.
A Liberal of the stereotyped sort for about
20 years, Gregory didn’t join the Country
Party until it had secured a mortgage on his
seat. He is past the age when men acquire
new enthusiasms and ideals. A useful old
Parliamentary hand, doubtless, but quite
impossible as a leader.
The S. M. Hekald remarked sadly the
other day that out of the 36,000,000 bushels
of wheat, mostly for export, that the N.S.W.
pool began to struggle with as early as last
November, 30,.000,000 are still at country
stations waiting to get through the bottle-
neck to Sydney, and also waiting for the
weevil to eventuate and the mouse to tran-
spire. A few more available ports might
help, but that subject is taboo.
Strike magnates are prone to wear a sur-
. prised expression when the go-slow policy is
mentioned, and to ask who ever heard of
such a thing and whether it is a new break-
fast food or a strange animal. Still, Judge
Curlewis found that a very elaborate hold-
up at a Sydney furniture factory was for
the sole purpose of getting rid of a man who
didn’t linger enough" on his job, he having
been previously hauled before the union and
admonished for not lingering. The fine was
£lOO, and it was added that the defence was

characterised by insolence, prevarication and
perjury. In the same connection a chief
electrical engineer testified before a Royal
Commission that the “card system” which
led to the railway strike of 1917 had also
led to 900 men doing the work of 1200, and
to the time for a particular class of job
being reduced from 40 hours to four. If it
wasn’t a case of go-slow before 1917 the
pace must be of the neck-breaking sort now.
From a man in the gallery:—
Portland (Vie.) is about to receive its long-
overdue recognition as a deep-sea port, for the
Australford will arrive next week for a load of
wheat. A railway and a special pier have long been
waiting for the expected rush of grain, and if the
Australford’s loading proves a success, other Com-
monwealth ships will drop in at intervals and save
the west Victorian cocky the trouble of trucking his
produce to Melbourne. This revolution, which is Vic-
toria’s first blow for decentralisation, has made such
a noise that various outsiders are crowding into the
limelight to take credit for the change. One of
them is Thomas, the State Labor member for
Glenelg, whilst other obscurities have butted in for
a share of the congratulations that are flying
around. But whatever they have done, it will be
trifling in comparison to the hard work of Arthur
Rodgers, acting-Minister for Repatriation. Long
before Arthur had turned his thoughts to politics,
he was a tireless barracker for Portland. Walter
Madden, brother of the recently deceased Prank and
John, had talked on the matter some years before
Rodgers, but it was that curly-headed cyclone who
had the biggest hand in the agitation of later years.
Representing a huge wheat area, he banged away at
the scheme when he became a Federal member. Even
when he joined the Ministry he organised deputations
to Senator Russell, Minister of Shipping, and though
the aforesaid Thomas claims that “it is owing to
my representations that the Australford is to be
sent to Portland,” there is no doubt in the writer’s
mind that Curly Rodgers did the trick.
A seamen’s strike took place lately at
Petrovsk, on the land-locked Caspian Sea,
which is a poor place for unsuccessful
strikers to escape from. The men didn’t ask
higher wages. What they objected to was
being told by their employer, the Govern-
ment, that in future they would get no cash
wages at all, and would be paid in truck.
However, the Government “deported” 700
strikers, which probably means that they
won’t reappear in the light of day for a
long time, if ever. Striking is a floggable,
gaolable, hangable offence in Russia. Then
the warship crews mutinied in sympathy,
and in the fuss there were three executions
and most of the vessels were blown up.
Russia is a bustling country, nowadays.
Even when Peter the Great was persuading
his subjects to shave and to wear pants
instead of bed-furniture things didn’t hum as
they do now.
On the failure of McTiernanism
Into the already complicated business of price-
fixing Kid McTiernan’s Anti-Profiteering Act has
introduced a new complication. A few months ago
the Necessary Commodities Commission raised the
price of N. S. Wales butter on the grounds (1) that,
dairying had suffered severely during the two years’
drought, and (2) that if it didn’t get some encourage-
ment it was in danger of being snuffed out alto-
gether, evidence to this effect being furnished by
Agricultural Department witnesses. Last week, with
the enthusiastic approval of the McTiernan Govern-
ment, which hired an expensive lawyer to argue for a
thumping reduction, Judge Beeby, of the Profiteering
Prevention Court, knocked 7 Id. a pound off the retail
price of butter. This extraordinary reversal of
form is susceptible of two interpretations, viz:—
(1) Having been a city lawyer all his life,
Mr. ' Beeby may consider that he knows more
about the dairying industry than the dairy-
farmers and the Agricultural Department ex-
perts.
(2) Having regard to the circumstances in
which the Anti-Profiteering Act was passed he
may consider it his duty to “get results” — i.e.,
by lowering prices—irrespective of the damage
to industry.
In either case the position is unsatisfactory to those
who produce the commodities by which Australia
lives and pays its interest bill. It suggests doubts
as to whether the power to wreck country industries
may be safely entrusted to bright young city lawyers.
A few days before the butter ukase Mr. Beeby
ordered a reduction of 4d. a gallon in the price of
Sydney’s milk. He commanded that the producer
should bear 3d. of the reduction and the city dis-
tributor the other penny: in other words, that Is. 2d.
a gallon (less cartage, railage and deductions for
losses) should go to the cow-cocky, and Is. 4d. a
gallon to the milk-o merchant, wholesale and retail.
This pronunciamento was also loudly applauded by
the Ivid McTiernan party, although it is dead against
the alleged Labor policy of “securing the full re-
sults of their industry to the producers.” It also
lays down the principle, which is nothing to rejoice
over, that the distributor is entitled to more than
the grower, and it reduces wages. Certainly they
are the dairy-farmer’s wages, and the dairy-farmer
doesn’t vote for the Labor party, but there is no deny-
ing that it is a reduction of wages—the first since
1914 —and it is a perilous precedent to establish in a
time of slump. In effect the first important judgment
of Kid McTiernan’s great anti-profiteering tribunal
(1) makes hash of the Labor policy of “securing to
the producers the full results of their industry,”
(2) affirms that the distributor deserves a greater
reward than the grower —in principle a justification
of profiteering—and (3) gives a lead to the baser
sort of employer by lowering wages. This comes
of allowing bright young political lawyers to
meddle in matters they know nothing about.
Meantime the cow-cocky, who works long hours at
a laborious and monotonous calling for a miserably
low wage, taking it all the year round, has borrowed
a leaf from the Labor book. He has gone on strike.
And instead of hailing him as a serf of industrialism
rising against the capitalistic oppressor, the McTier-
nans of the community rage furiously, call upon
him to think of the grievous damage he is doing to
the city sundae shops, and threaten, with rare in-
consistency—and with pathetic futility—to com-
mandeer his cows and milk them with what, in
other circumstances, they call scab labor. The strike
has shown the fallacy of the Labor contention that
organised wage-earners are the whole box-and-dice of
industry. It will give a notable impetus to the
New State movement and unite all country producers
in opposition to the intolerable arrogance of Sydney.
Some of the Sydney unemployed for -whom
the Dooley Ministry found, or invented,
work, accompanied by full union wages, at
Maroubra, were rather a difficult class to
provide for. Early in the proceedings they
began to hold stop-work meetings on the job,
the habit of suspending work to talk things
over while the wages go on as usual having
come to be a recognised and valued institu-
tion. But the harassed Government lost
its “block” and victimised 48 of them real
hard. When they applied for reinstate-
ment they were told that their chance was
Buckley’s, that stop-work meetings must be
held out of working hours, and that in
future jobs would be viven through the Labor
Department, and not handed out promiscu-
ously to processions or denutations. In
another year, especially if they get another
rise of salary in the interim, some of the
Ministers who wept over the I.W.W. pris-
oners may look more like, .say. Bruce Smith
than Bruce Smith looks himself.
“Gallery” : Though the Arbitration Court
is now under the control of Justice Powers
there is still a lot of polite wrangling re-
garding the position of Justice Higgins. He
announced his resignation a while back, but
failed to deliver the same in writing and with
suitable ceremony to Mr. Hughes, and the
latter declared that he was still officially
ignorant of the Judge’s decision. Since that
time Higgins, J., has properly notified his
resignation, though he isn’t stepping down
from the Arbitration bench. In fact, he is
hanging on to complete some part-heard eases
that will keep him fastened indefinitely to
the billet that he spurned in formal legal
language six months ago.
The farmers of the Federal territory at
Canberra had a brief argument with the
N.S.W. Wheat Board the other day, and lost
in the first round. They don’t belong to the
State, and didn’t want to put their wheat in
the State pool. The answer was almost in
these words : “If you don’t put your wheat
in the N.S.W. pool it won’t be carried on the
N.S.W. railways. You may not be N.S.W.
subjects, but your fool-capital is surrounded
by N.S.W. territory and you can consider
yourself blockaded.” Whatever the merits
of this particular dispute the same mailed-
fist argument would apply in any dispute,
and it might extend to blocking people and
goods of all sorts. If the railway is built
to Jervis Bay the Federal capital will have
a sort of escape of its own, but, as the
Federal cocky-farm at the bay isn’t big
enough to make a real port with ships com-
ing to it, the escape will be more nominal
than real. Canada and the U.S. each put
its metrbpolis on a border line with an out-
let into two States and a third outlet by
water, and as the railways are owned by
companies, which the Federal Parliament
controls, these cities can’t be held up. Can-
berra, surrounded by the property of the
most populous and arrogant State, and de-
pendent on that State’s roads and railways
for daily food, is the prize fool-metropolis
of history. This little episode suggests what
is coming to it.
HYMN OF CALICO STREET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The National movement demanded trust in its
leaders.... The great men of a country should be
esteemed, admired and revered.”— -National Club
speech of W. .4. Holman.
“Mr. lnnes-Noad said that they would have to be
a body of militant missionaries to bring the people
back to sanity.”
Oh! Let the common people come
And worship at the York-street shrine,
"Where every other praise is dumb
But to the Freetrade god that’s mine.
Teach them the politician here
To worship, love, admire, revere.
Trust in your leaders, I demand,
No matter how they cog and lie—
Unless ye be as futile sand
Or as the wind that wanders by.
Let common people see the road
As pointed out by lnnes-Noad.
The missionaries militant
Of York-street sing their hymn again.
Each haberdasher-immigrant
Shall pray to make Australia sane;
To vote for those who at the polls
Lost both their bodies and their souls.
St. Holman and St. lnnes-Noad —
With ex-Republican St! Cook—
Faint-hearted they beneath the load,
Behold their pale, despairing look.
They dying are and voteless here,
Because them people won’t revere.
Oh! Common herd that worships not
In York-street or in Flinders-lane,
That bows not down to the job-lot
And otherwise is proved insane;
That to the polling-booth doth go
Without a thought of calico.
Oh! Soften, Lord, we pray, their hearts
Make them esteem, admire, revere
The politician who departs
Without their sigh or sob or tear.
Strengthen Freetrade-street —let us see
The common herd find sanity.
Ah-men!
QUEENSLAND.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.

The latest net profits are not nearly so hand-
some as those for the June term ; but in that
record half Sargent’s had been assisted by
Teddy Woodbine’s visit. Still, the profit dis-
closed represented a 14 p.c. return on capi-
tal ; so the usual 10 p.c. is passed out with
ease. Probably £11,005 did not represent
the full measure of the net earnings for the
six months. A couple of years ago a taxation
reserve was opened with a credit of £7700,
and this was augmented by £2300 a year
ago and by a further £3OOO during the past
term. Since this reserve has not been tapped
by the Treasuries, it is clear that all current
taxes are otherwise fully provided for, and
that the £13,000 in the reserve can probably
be regarded as additional stored-up profit. In
the table above neither the profits nor the
reserves include the amounts set aside for
taxation. The effects of high prices and an
expanded business and of heavier working
costs are visible in this comparison of the
only two entries which make up the P. & L.
account. The figures are for Dec. half-years,
and gross profits are shown less depreciation,
etc.: —
Gross Profits. Expenses. Gross Profits. Expenses

1917.. 77,086 71,029 | 1920. . 126,389 115,384
The amounts provided for depreciation are
not disclosed, and whether they have been
over-liberal cannot be ascertained. This
much is visible; the cost of any additions,
improvements, etc., plus £2230 was written
off the book value of plant and equipment
during the past half-year, ,and £llOO was
similai-ly written off leaseholds and improve-
ments thereto.
Balance-sheet figures compare over 10
years in this way :■ —-
1910. 1915. 1920.
Capital £90,000 £111,277 £159,931
Liabilities .. .. 12,948 34,755 53,347

Stock 3,447 19,788 70,541
Cash, hook debts & invest-
ments 8,370 19,666 16,265
The co. is holding abnormally large stocks at
present, and no explanation is offered why
more than double the normal amount should
have been on hand at Dec. 31. Sargent’s has
been a very .successful co. Ten years ago
half of its paid capital of £90,000 was repre-
sented by goodwill, but reserves were rapidly
accumulated against that item, and it disap-
peared from the balance-sheet altogether
three years ago. Paid capital is now
£156,250 (£3681 of calls paid in advance
have been regarded as capital in the table
above), but £25,000 of the total represents
reserves capitalised last year. The con-
cern has in the 10 years thus expanded as
shown by the comparison above with the
assistance of only £44.931 of additional cash
put up by shareholders. A more satisfac-
tory view of the 10 years’ operations is got
in this way :
Increase of | Increase of
Cash-paid capital. £44,931 | Fixed assets .. £93,280
Liabilities .. 40,399 | Liquid assets.. 74,989
£85,330 | £168,269
So in 10 years, after regular divs. of 10 p.c.
have been paid, the enterprise has, on book
figures, been assisted by almost £84,000 of
accumulated profit. It is a magnificent
record for the tea-and-cake business, in
which so many have crashed. Efficient man-
agement has alone been responsible, and on
its continuance depends the future prosperity
of the co.

This is a very old concern in which the
public has been interested only a few years.
It had its beginning in the ’sixties, when
David Mitchell, who had come to Australia
in the gold-rush days, established a provision
and wine and spirit business in Sydney with
the money he had made storekeeping at
Ipswich (Q.). An extensive importing trade
had been built up by the time Federation
arrived ; then the first Commonwealth tariff
gave the Mitchells new opportunities, and
they at once set about putting in plant
to manufacture and pack foodstuffs. A year
previously the business had been passed over
to a co. of 50,000 £1 shares, all held by
the Mitchell family. By 1913 the business
had developed so well that the public was
invited to help with some cash, nominal capi-
tal being increased to £150,000. The co. now
manufactures about 00 lines and packs more
than 40 others, and so great has been the'
demand for its products that factory accom-
modation has practically doubled in less
than five years. Paid capital for several
years remained stationary at £147,136,
but last year a further £77,814 was got in,
making the total £225,000 —all in ordinaries,
the newcomers thus sharing the opportuni-
ties—and also any risks, of course—with the
old proprietary interests.
A feature of the balance-sheet is the
absence of any goodwill item, the whole of
the outside money got in being represented
by tangible assets, though the first issue to
the public was put out at a premium. As
the introductory table shows, there has been
nothing fat about the profits disclosed during
the few years for ivhieh accounts have been
published. Though the war no doubt
assisted the co.’s turnover, many of its pro-
ducts have been subject to price-fixing. The
published accounts, however, are not very
informative: all exes, are lumped in one
entry, and no indication is given of the
allowances made for depreciation, etc. Gross
profits for 1917 were £82,979; for 1920,
£121,958. Meantime exes., not including
provision for taxation and staff bonuses, have
advanced from £66,941 to £100.745. Over
the same period the balance-sheet figures
have moved in this way;—
1917. 1918. 1919. 1920.
Capital . . £147,186 £147,186 £147,186 £225,000
Liabilities . . 138,005 130,813 179,512 145,136
Properties and
plant . . 20,552 20,846 21,044 24,435
Stock . . 113,155 120,058 99,721 128,350
Book debts . . 178,686 167,175 238,174 255,186
Cash, etc. .. 6,026 5,510 7,754 8,770
A feature of that comparison is that though
considerable extensions of the Sydney fac-
tory were completed in 1919 —its accommo-
dation was practically doubled —and tenders
were called for new premises at Newcastle
during the past term, the book value of fixed
assets has grown less than £4OOO since 1917.
That looks as though there has been con-
siderable writing-down of premises, etc. Not-
withstanding the smaller stocks held, owing
to the rapid growth of book debts liabilities
exceeded capital in 1919, but the £77,814
got in from shareholders during the year has
again put capital in the lead. The balance-
sheet position depends entirely on the basis
on which stocks have been taken, and on
the soundness of the very large trade accounts.
As to the former, the directors declare that
they had anticipated the decline in values in
the world’s markets, and that “a conserva-
tive policy was adopted in regard to pur-
chases.” Assuming that stocks prove to be
worth all they are shown at in the books—-
and in a business of rapid turnovers like
Mitchell’s there should be little danger of
accumulating costly unsaleable lines —and
provided book debts are well protected, after
payment of final divs. the co. had net tan-
gible assets with a book value of 235. Id. to
represent each £1 share.

The dates on which div.-distributions were
made is not clearly stated by the published
reports and balance-sheets. The latest
accounts show £3350 as having been passed
out to shareholders, but apparently that
represented appropriations of profits of the
previous term. Last year was an extremely
difficult one for tanners and the leather-
goods trade generally, and the position is still
uncomfortable. During 1919 a number of
’Murkan operators became active in the
local market and sent prices soaring. The
trade had a wonderful time witli its cheaply-
purchased stocks while the boom lasted ; but
people who thought higher prices had come
to stay have been badly bitten: smaller con-
cerns have gone under, while some of the
big ones have incurred losses running into
five figures, though most were wise enough
to have anticipated and provided for a
slump in hides and skins. Hides are now
around 44d. and sd. per lb.; stocks were
accumulated at prices averaging about Is.
lOd. Under these circumstances leather-
manufacturers have been standing off, in
the hope that they can secure supplies at
prices more in keeping with the lower value
of hides. As a result, there was a heavy
falling-off of I’yrotan profits for the year
ended November 30. At that date stocks
on hand had a book value of £11,710, but
since then the co. has succeeded in unload-
ing some of the expensive stuff at fair prices,
thus enabling it to get clear of the bog with
the assistance of purchases in the low
market. Though disclosed profits were suffi-
cient to give a 6 p.c. div., the directors do
not consider the position safe enough to
recommend any distribution, though if every-
thing goes well for the next three or four
months they propose to give shareholders
a taste.
The Pyrotan balance-sheet is a siok-look-
ing. affair ; but that is no fault of the_ pre-
sent management. I’aid capital is £35,594,
but of the assets no less than £27,422 repre-
sents “goodwill” and patent rights. The
concern had a bad beginning: it was floated
in 1913 in response to the appeal of an
elaborate prospectus which made extrava-
gant claims for a patent-leather process
from which the co. takes its name. Pro-
moters bagged 1000 £lO fully-paids; and
the co. paid 300 shares and £3OOO of cash
for the rights. Even if all the shares offered
were subscribed it could not have started
With more than £7OOO of working capital,
while, to finance the purchase of an .old
tannery, it was committed to meeting £2500
of debentures within five years. The posi-
tion was soon found to be hopeless, so James
Mackay, who runs a string of mining and
other cos., was called in to try to prevent
a total wreck. To secure further working
capital, it was decided to reconstruct; and
at the same time assets were revalued. Appa-
rently there were, at the time, difficulties in
the way of cleaning up the .balance-sheet,
and the deficiency resulting from the revalua-
tion was passed into the “goodwill” account.
The introductory table gives the co.’s record
since it began afresh. It started with
£28.557 of capital represented by the prac-
tically worthless goodwill item; but the
deficit lias now been reduced to £17,540.
Assuming the co. gets through the present
anxious period without damage, there are
net assets with a book value of almost £5
(Is. to represent each £l2 10s. share paid to

A few years ago Flinders-lane and York-
street would not have believed it possible
for an Australian shirt and collar factory
(o have grown to the size Pelaco, Ltd., has.
The war, of course, by curtailing imports,
gave the concern its big opportunity, and
though overseas manufactures have poured
into the Commonwealth in unprecedented
volumes during the past year, Pelaco has not
only held its ground but has apparently
made a substantial advance on its previous
performances. As Pearson, Law & Co., Ltd.,
in pre-war days there was £35,400 of capital
in the business, and the going was not easy.
Paid capital has now grown to more than
four times that size, and the balance in the
Profit and Loss account at December 31
last was only a couple of thousands less than
the old share capital. Gross profits are now
almost 4J times those of six years ago, the
rapid progress made in tliis respect being
shown hereunder

1917 . . . . 34,777 1920 . . . . 89,659
Expenses last year took £60.204, leaving the
£29,455 shown in the first table. Deducting
the £2165 written off for depreciation, the
net profit was £27,290, or a return of 25 p.c.
on ordinary capital after providing for pref.
dividends. The ordinaries got 15 p.c., leav-
ing £12,286 available for reserves and mak-
ing the whole of capital once more wholly
represented by tangible assets. Five years
ago a reconstruction added- £18,486 to
goodwill items, the new concern —which
abbreviated the old title of Pearson, Law
and Co. —beginning with £17,632 of its capi-
tal represented by intangible assets. Now,
notwithstanding the*handsome divs. paid,
there are assets, apart from goodwill, with a
book value of £12,283 in excess of paid capi-
tal.
Another view of the progress made by the
co. during the four years since the recon-
struction is shown in this comparison:—
1917. 1918. 1919. 1920.

Cash, etc. . . 5,186 509 4,669 9,652
Of the present paid capital of £148,486,
£29,736 is 7 p.c. Ist prefs. of £1 each, and
£50.000 9 p.c. 2nd £1 prefs., on which a
final call of ss. was made last year. Ordi-
nary capital is £68,750 —110,000 shares of
10s. each, and a similar number paid to 2s.
(id., the latter having been issued during the
past year. The new funds have been got
in to help finance a new factory—“one of the
most commodious and up-to-date” in the
Commonwealth —which should be completed
before the next accounts appear. Compared
with three years ago, at Dec. 31 last there
was £60,750 more capital in the business
and £34,187 more outside money, together
an additional £100,937. Meantime, the book
value of fixed assets had grown £17,411,
and liquid assets had advanced £117,409. So
in the three years the co.’s position was
improved by £33,883 after paying handsoihe
divs.

A few years ago this co. was paying 9 p.c.
divs. with ease. But in 1917 Maoriland
wisely began to tax hard to meet a reason-
able proportion of its war expenses out of
revenue. Taxes for the past year paid by
the Wellington Trust, Loan and Investment
were several hundred pounds less than was
passed out for the previous couple of years,
but they were still almost six times what
was paid to the Treasury in 1913. Here
are further details :

Management, etc... 2,086 2,159 2,237 2,426
Taxes .. .. 84 9 5,616 5,377 5,055
Though income after paying interest on
deposits was £19,347 last year compared
with £15,108 for 1913, net profits were
smaller than six years ago. Taxes now
take an amount equal to 4 p.c. of capital.
Shareholders have been getting 71 p.c., but
since many of the shares were subscribed at
a premium the return is milder, while on
total shareholders’ funds, the .71 p.c. repre-
sents a return of less than 5 p.c.
The amount out on mortgage at Dec. 31
last was smaller than 12 months previously,
and liabilities have also been reduced. A
comparison of balance-sheet figures follows:

The best evidence of the increasing favor with which our Patent Curvilinear Concentrator
is regarded is the fact that mines, having installed one or more, send us repeat orders
when additional Tables are required. This has occurred recently in the case of several
mines.
The fame of this remarkable little Table is spreading abroad, for, in addition to several
shipments to the East, a shipment has just been made to Durban for a South African order.

plans for the factory and intend securing
as much plant locally as possible. For a
start, a four-sett woollen plant is to be

The half-year ended December 81 was
Bendigo Amalgamated’s best to date, and
it was all due to the little Constellation and
the big Unity. The progress of the Amal-
gamated has been as follows: —
Half-year, Loss. Profit.
Dec., 1917 £38,459 —-
June, 1918 20,382
Dec., 1918 10,718 ~
June, 1919 £2,934
Dec., 1919 31,250
June, 1920 79,631
Dee., 1920 70,503
During the last three terms, the gold pre-
mium has provided £5902, £07,700 and
£05,092, or £138,700 of the total profits
earned of £184,318. So roughly £45,500 is
the profit that would have shown with gold
at standard price. The profits shown above
f° r the last two half-years do not include
£20,000 set aside at each balance for depre-
ciation or for new plant. The casli position
since June 30 has altered as follows: —

No wonder some of the disgruntled Mel-
bourne crowd are dividend-hungry. Their
wrath is not lessened by Dyason affirming
that the Board —which is Dyason—“cannot
justifiably declare another dividend until the
mining outlook improves” even though he
would be left with a surplus of £120.900 if
he were to concede a sixpenny. Bendigo to
a man, on the other hand, hankers after indus-
trial sweets such as Dyason premises from
rubber when Moline returns from his Ameri-
can expedition. To rasp the critics Dyason
admits to having four good developments:
two new reefs show in the Nelson workings
on the Derby line, another is being developed
at Monument Hill, on the Deborah line, and
the Sheepshead anticline is being followed
in the Hercules shaft. He sugars his pill
further by saying that at no time in the
co.’s history have the immediate prospecting
chances been so encouraging. All this is
very well, but if labor doesn’t work harder,'
if mine essentials don’t come down in price,
and if wages don’t ease. Bendigo Amalga-
mated’s accumulated profits will change into
thin air. When so good a friend of labor as
Dyason talks in this strain, it is time labor
did a bit of hard thinking. In the pre-war
days costs ran out under sdwt.; now they
swallow double, that, and accordingly big capi-
tal expenditure has to be carefully.
To checkmate doubting Thomases who do not
want to plunge into the rubber scheme,
Dyason declares that their interests “will
be fully protected.” Was there ever such a
man?

“Carbonate”: A great deal has been heard
about the profiteering of Broken Hill metal
producers since 1914; but consider the posi-
tion of the investor who became interested
in Barrier stocks in pre-war days, and has
had to realise on his scrip lately. On July
1. 1914. the market price of Norths was
535., Souths 1965., Zinc Corp. 215... and
British 365. 6d. At the beginning of last
month the shares were quoted at 28s. 6d.,
265. 6d. (reconstructed), 11s. and 18s. 6d.
respectively. For every £lOOO laid out in the
market in July, 1914, the investor who sold
on February prices would have wound up
his account in this way:—
From Loss of Divs. Ite- Result of
Sale. Capital, ceivecl. Investment.
North B.H. .. £538 £462 £584. Profit, £122
B.H. South . . 541 459 459 Nil
Zinc. Corp. .. 524 476 456* Loss, 20
British 8.H.. . 507 493 274 Loss, 219
♦Deducting English income tax.
The return to the investor of £lOOO in
Norths works out at under 2 p.c. p.a. for
the 64 years; in Souths he would have
dropped a few shillings; in Zinc Corp. he
would have shown a loss of .03 p.c. p.a., and
in British a loss of 4.62 p.c. p.a.

Golden Point was formed during the
height of the Westonia boom to acquire a
lease south of Edna May Consolidated, and
although the optimism of hard-working man-
ager Stokes was the most it had to show,
shares quickly went to 225. The public got
the stock mostly at this price, and was
left with it. The co. went to Hampton Plains
but struck nothing. The Westonia proposi-
tion contains a narrow quartz vein from
which a number of small parcels of ounce
ore hai r e been extracted, but the gross value
of the bullion thus won has not represented
one-fifth of the expenditure incurred on the
lease. The directors now declare that the
recent wages award precludes any possibility
of profits accruing from further operations.
This is true, but a similar position existed
prior to the. award. The mine is to be
thrown open to tributors. A similar course
might as well be followed with all Westonia
concerns. The mines there had no chance
after the Edna May pumps ceased opera-
tions, and this seemed to be known to
everyone except the directors of the cos. con-
cerned. Since the Edna May pumps went
out of action, the other cos. have been en-
gaged principally in installing flood-gates
and pumping machinery.
* * * *
The public has been nibbling at Golden
Butterfly (W.A.) shares. The Butterfly
lode, although likely to prove a pay&ble pro-
position as a tributing affair, has little
chance of becoming a dividend payer. There
are 200,000 shares in the co., and at present
market price the mine is valued at £20.000.
The property cannot be described as a duffer :
the mine is opened up to a depth of 180 ft.
and there a lode sft. wide goes 15dwt. But
the ground is very hard, and the lode has
not been opened up for any considerable
length.
* * * *
Edna May Battler (W.A.) returns are offi-
cially admitted to be wretched, but the cause
of failure is alleged to be defective sliming.
The show’s few remaining admirers claim
that new plant costing about £3OOO will put
things right, but it is doubtful whether
shareholders will put up the cash, and more
doubtful still whether the proposed expendi-
ture would be justified.
* * * *
The mountain of manganese beyond Pe&k
Hill (W.A.), together with a railway con-
cession, is to be put up for sale in London.
The probable value of the ore in sight is
estimated at £13,000,000, but definite costs
of winning and marketing the stuff are not
clear, nor are the prospects of successfully
competing with Indian and other products.
It is interesting to note, moreover, that so
far the syndicate owning the hill and con-
cession has not been rushed with offers of
purchase.
* * * *
Norman A. Smith, who sec.’s the ill-fated
Lass o’ Gowrie, formerly of Mt. Monger
(W.A.), forwards copies of contracts and
receipts showing that the cost of removal of
plant and buildings to the Nature’s Reward
claim, St Ives, was £79, not “nearly £looo,’’
as stated by a contributor (B. 17/2/’2l).
He also declares that the directors “had not
the slightest intention” of taking up the old
Oversight, at Bulong.
* * * *
“Chas. Mack”: “O.B.” (B. 17/2/’2l) is
wrong in stating that “the only part of
Westralia where any indications whatever of
petroleum have been found is on one of
Durack’s stations in the Kimberley.” John
Forrest mentioned finding bitumen on the
watershed of the Kimberley, and his brother
Alexander, in his explorations from the De
Gray to Darwin, found samples of bitumen
on the Negri River. This latter find has
been substantiated and pegged out quite
recently.
* * * *
Chiltern Valley (Vic.) goes to the pack
with £9533 in hand. On 30,000 shares this
would give a reasonable div., but the taxa-
tion expert has to be outwitted. So the co.
is to go into liquidation. Then the div.
won’t be a div., but a return of capital.
* * * *
White Crystal (N.S.W.) hopes to get its
mill going next week. Crystal bought the
old North Nuggetty Ajax (Vic.) plant, and
thought to get it into action in about six
weeks after its arrival at Ardlethan. But
it has taken four months and a lot of cash
to make it what the old White Crystal crowd
reckoned it to be —which bears out all The
Bulletin had to say about the pur-
chase. However, that trouble has been
overcome, and the co. reckons on hav-
ing as good a plant as any on the field.
Meantime, other troubles are gradually
being straightened out. When Sydney took
over there appeared to be a handy balance
in the till, though not so much as the £6OOO
mentioned by the “Wild Cat” last week.
Unfortunately for the new crow T d they soon
discovered that the former management had
incurred expenses that absorbed practically
the whole of the cash transferred.
* * * *
C. W. Gudgeon, g.m. at Mt. Bischoff
since Millen got into the Senate, talks of
getting the old show off the rocks. Recov-
ery is to come from the treatment of the
pyritic tin-bearing material of which there
is a fair reserve. The idea is to concentrate
and roast the ore, the grade of the stuff to
be 2.15 p.c. tin. Already 2200 tons are
ready for the two Edwards furnaces being
erected to work on continuous lines. When
roasted the Wilfley and slime tables will
furnish a 70 p.c. product,’ which, being
freed from impurities, will be easy material
for the smelter to turn into metallic tin. Old
workings are being scraped over by Gudgeon
with more or less luck, just as did Millen
when he took up Fred Kayser’s mantle. The
old brown face has a new level under it, and
thousands of tons of marcasite are being ex-
posed in as sulphurous an atmosphere as is
promised for the future of some of the old
gang of politicians. Costs are up because
of awards, and reserves are down. Latest
estimates give 518,750 tons, made up of
253,850 tons positive ore and 513,750 tons
probable. This big shrinkage on Milieu’s
figures is because the North Valley flats have
been passed over to tributors. To show the
sort of stuff out df which Gudgeon hopes to
make profits, he estimates the run of the
positive ore to contain only .353 p.c. tin.
Since he got going again his mill has handled
54,199 tons with an average stamp duty of
10 tons daily. The oxide won was 203 f tons,
averaging 64.38 p.c. tin. A profit of £3414
was netted for the last six months. A div.
absorbed £4500, so after writings-down the
co. now shows the reduced credit at P. & L.
of £71,018, as against £74,236 with which
the half-year started. The financial position
is solid. Against debts of £2998 stand the
following liquid assets: stores, £6410; bonds
and securities, £17,240; tin, £5548; and sun-
dry debtors, etc., £8798.
* * * *
Low tin prices and ever-increasing costs
have put the Bischoff Extended (Tas.) out
of operation until more favorable conditions
prevail. Restricted operations have been the
vogue for the last few months, but these
have ceased, and the show has passed into
the hands of a caretaker. During the last
18 years or so the co. has put up a great
struggle with its narrow lode and in low
metal markets.
* * * *
Renison Bell (Tas.) is to have an in-
crease of capital from 40,000 to 80,000 shares
at 10s. each. It is hoped by this scheme to
raise enough money to satisfy the mort-
gagees for a while, and thus give time
to deal with certain inquiries already set
on foot by mining engineers abroad. The
whole of which seems a bit vague and uncer-
tain, especially in the face of the tribute
party having quitted operations as unpay-
able when tin stood at £220 per ton.
* * * . *
Federation tin (Tas.) has got a step
nearer the producing stage by letting a con-
tract for the construction of the tramway
from the Comstock line to the mine. The
work is to be completed within three months
and will cost £4785, half of which is to be
paid by the Speck Government. The 40-
head battery of the old Tasmania gold-mine
is packed ready for transport when the line
is completed.
* * * *
Clark's, Charters Towers, will distribute
6d. per share (£2250) next week, bringing
the dividend total- up to £27,000 since the
first paid in 1917. In addition, profits from
the mine covered about £3OOO expended last
year on a battery-compressor plant and
buildings. All this has been won from a
reef not averaging more than 9in. thick;
but it has been very rich in patches, some
of the earlier crushings going £22 per ton,
while the average now is from £lO to
£ll. The latest 250 tons gave £2200,
with cyanide returns to come. Stop-
ing is now proceeding between Nos. 9
and 10 levels at a depth of 900 ft. on
the shoot of ore which has been followed
down from 500 ft. Early in 1914, just after
operations were started, the market valua-
tion of the mine was £l5OO. Now it pans
out at £21,000. Up to the last crushing it
has turned out gold worth just over
£120,000. Total costs over the whole period
work out at £7 per ton, due to large amounts
expended on developing the Lady Maria
end of the workings, and to the small
reef and the expensive crushing costs which
ruled until the co. secured its own battery.
Shareholders should now secure a bigger
margin from gold won.

Despite the low tin market, Dereks Tin
Mines, Ltd., Stannary Hills (N.Q.), is
going actively ahead equipping its property.
The co. took over the Lass o’ Gowrie and
You and Me mines recently, and the erection
of a 10-lid. battery is practically completed
A 70-h.p. engine, concentrating and slime
tables, rock-breaker and classifier and several
dressing floors have been installed. A cal-
cining plant is being erected, and a tram-
line laid from the Lass o’ Gowrie to the mill.
The recent rains have filled the dams built
on lona and Eureka creeks. The You and
Me has a large tonnage of good-grade ore
blocked out. It is intended to work the
mine by open-cut.
Shortage of labor has hampered West-
port-Stockton coal (MX.), but the outlook
in that respect is brightening, partly be-
cause the co. induced a number of Welsh
miners to sign on. They are be-
coming accustomed to local conditions, and
“are doing good work,” say the directors.
Last year’s output was 130,750 tons—2427
tons more than for the previous year—and
a gross profit of £94,452 resulted. Freights
swallowed no less than £63,545 of that, and
after meeting all other exes, (including
£4687 income tax) there remained a profit
of £16,389. Paid capital is £197,785—a1l in
10s. shares, £66,315 representing 8 p.c.
prefs. After paying the pref. div. 6 p.c.
was handed out to the' ordinaries. Besides
shareholders’ capital the co. is working on
£40.625 of debentures, and at Dec. 31 owed
£20,202. Against these debts of £60,827 the
co. showed £57,705 of more or less liquid
assets.

Gold-mining at Eeefton (M.L.) is look-
ing very sick at present: 16s. per shift for
miners is proving too heavy a load for the
ore-grade to carry. The Consolidated group
has closed down on all work at its Ener-
getic and Progress mines, and is endeavor-
ing to raise £lO,OOO in London to secure
the Government’s promised subsidy for a
trial sink of another 500 ft. in the Progress
in an effort to get beyond the fault influence
which had such a disastrous effect below No.
11 level. Murray Creek, Ajax and the
famous old producer, Keep-It-Dark, are
closed down definitely. The only mine of
importance is the Blackwater, the baby of
the Consolidated group, but labor shortage
is troublesome. The trial shipment of 70
Cornish miners has turned out badly, the
men being generally unsuitable. At depth
the lode is reported to be maintaining its
grade and width, and should, under normal
labor conditions, be a substantial producer.

“Imagine a Harding or a Cox crossed with
a Gompers, and you have a very fair picture
of the average Australian statesman of the
Hughes type. The fellow is a mere political
blatherskite without the slightest relieving
touch of rakish charm. And his followers
are merely swine.” —Appreciation from the
February number of the N.Y. Smart Set.
TAKING NO RISK.
SHORTUN : “What’s the hurry? There’s
another train at 5.27 .”
LONGUN : “Yes, hut I want to get my pay
home to the missus before the cost of
living goes up again!”
Henry Teesdale Smith has finished life’s
contract. Born in Croweaterland 62 years
ago, he took all Australia for his pro-
vince, and there were few parts of the Com-
monwealth in which he hadn’t constructed
bridges, railways, silos and what not. Tees-
dale’s best work was done in Westralia 20
years ago. There he gridironed the jarrah
country with serviceable lines, built at £BOO a
mile, and when the timber companies amal-
gamated they made him general manager at
£5OOO a year, a tidy salary in those days for
a man of 43. About the same time he got
into Parliament as M.L.A. for one of the
timber constituencies, but soon found that
politics wasn’t his game. Now and then
Smith’s tactless loquacity landed him in
trouble with his toilers, but from first to last
they had a curious liking for him, which
was independent of strikes. Long ago they
came to the conclusion that the bark of the
argumentative, bearded man was worse than
his bite
Accident has deprived the Westralian
Assembly of its most industrious member- —
Harry Griffiths, of York. He was one of the
Country Party group that arrived in 1914,
and he displayed an insatiable appetite for
toil. During the
session he would
write letters to his
cocky constituents
by the hundred, and
every city news-
paper office has re-
jected scores of his
passionate articles,
composed in multi-
colored ink, on
such matters as the
Gobble gutting rail-
way tank and the
Doodlakine drain.
When recess came
the martyr to duty
would hop on an
old jigger and plug
through his long,
hot electorate; in
fact, his mind was
so absorbed in the
affairs of his con-
stituents that he
forgot about his
nomination - paper
till the last moment
and then sent it to
the wrong office.
So poor Griffiths
will be missing
from the next Par-
liament.
His Federal
Ex. LORD
FORSTER.
Dr. J. 11. Hertz, head serang of British
Jewry, who is on the first pastoral tour of
the Empire since his particular job was
created somewhere about 200 years ago,
reached Westralia the other day. There is tra-
velling with him Albert M. Woolf, a vice-
pres. of the London United Synagogue, who
is out after a million td establish a great
college of Judaism as a war memorial.
Hertz, by the way, was minister of a syna-
gogue at Johannesburg when the Boer War
started. Kruger “opened” that synagogue.
He was with difficulty prevented from taking
off his hat in the sacred edifice; and at the
end of a rugged, earnest speech he formally
declared the synagogue open “in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
“Gallery”: In the late Frank Madden’s
most interesting election he was opposed
by Alf Lumsden, a man of many parts, who
used to be known as Czerny the Conjurer.
Madden, who liked opponents of Birth and
Consequence, was not highly elated by this
appearance of the (to hipt) unknown Lums-
den, and asked one of his committee for all
particulars of the enemy. “Why, don’t you
know him, sir?” said the committeeman. “He
is Czerny the magician.” “Well, answered
Madden gruffly, “lie’ll need all his magic to
produce a majority here.” As a matter of
fact, Lumsden used only the magic of his
tongue and personality, and Madden just
scraped home.
The tribute of “Lex”: —
“Jock” Garland, K.C., who died in Sydney aged
58 last week, really inspired the grief which his
friend and colleagues expressed for the purposes of
publication. He was a most lovable little man ; and
though he hit trenchantly both at the Bar and in
politics—he had the stentorian declamatory manner,
of the Edmund Burke school-r-he never made a real
enemy. The nearest he ever went to being disliked
was in connection with his friendship with Holman
(in whose Ministry he became A.-G.) at a period
when that gentleman was a good deal less popular
in high financial circles than he became later on.
Garland’s friends in the Australian Club mildly dis-
approved of the strange alliance for some time, con-
doning it, however, on the score of the K.C.’S extra-
ordinary ambition. As a matter of fact he lived
to excel —it was his master passion—but he never
sacrificed a principle or a friend to it, and the
further he went in State politics the cleaner he
appeared amid the'prevailing grime. He cared little
for sport and less for Society, and had most frugal
tastes. His church—he was a Presbyterian—
absorbed a good deal of his abounding energy, and
no one ever heard him say an uncharitable thing.
N. S. Wales public life has produced plenty of bigger
men, but few better ones.
' Veteran Maoriland politician Jack Horns-
by, whose death is cabled, had been so long
in the Shaky Isles that hardly anybody
remembered that he originally hailed from
the Speck. His dad, who was connected
with the police force in the Vandemonian
days, amused himself in later life penning
racy reminiscences under the pen-name “The
Vet.” He wrote a series of “Old Time
Records” for Launceston Daily Telegraph
in the middle ’nineties, one of w’hich brought
the old sea-horse, Captain John Strachan,
snorting down from the China seas with a
demand for heavy damages. The mariner,
who had not been heard of for years,
and was understood to have disappeared in
it scrimmage with pirates, collected a verdict
for £2OOO from the 1).T., and afterwards
settled in Sydney. “The Vet.’s” “Old Time
Records,” which had just been re-printed in
book form, suddenly went out of print, the
whole edition vanishing in the furnace of
Salisbury’s foundry one dark night. Several
younger brothers of Seddon’s faithful Waira-
rapa henchman are prominent in Tasmanian
musical circles, some of them top-notch ex-
ponents of the brazen art. None of them
have blown into politics.
J. T. Haekett, one of Adelaide’s literary
lawyers, is back after two years in Eng-
land. He has had a big success in an unex-
pected way. About 40 years ago he kept a
Commonplace book, filled gradually with all
kinds of interesting quotations. This he
lately took a fancy to publish. London found
the mixed feeding interesting, and a fresh
edition has been necessary. The criticisms
lof the literary journals are complimentary,
and Ilaekett’s own notes and suggestive
comments, have landed him in some contro-
versies with Englishmen of repute.
“Black Bonnet” : An odd character passed
out recently at Cooktown (Q.). Known indif-
ferently as “Korn the Swiss” and “Prospec-
tor Korn,” he had found several fortunes in
his time. He it was who discovered the
Monte Carlo, a rich surface show on the
Normanby. Korn always went out alone,
having no use for mates except his horses,
of which he made camp pets, giving them a
share of johnny-cake, damper or whatever
was going. The old chap was found dead
in his humpy by a neighbor. He left a nice
sum in ready cash, and there are no known
relatives.
“T. 0.1.”: On March 6, 84 years since,
Governor Bourke encamped on the flat south
of the Yarra, and on the Bth he approved of
the plan of the town, and called it Melbourne
after the Prime Minister of the day. The
streets running east and west were named
Flinders, after the navigator; Collins, after
the first Governor of Tasmania; Bourke,
after the Governor; Lonsdale, after the
Resident Magistrate. The north and south
streets were named King and Queen for
obvious reasons; Elizabeth, after Bourke’s
wife; Swanston, after a Tasmanian magnate
(one of Batman’s syndicate) ; Russell, after
Lord John Russell; and Spring, after Spring
Rice, a noted British Parliamentarian. The
origin of Stephen-street is uncertain. Lat-
robe, who gave his name to Latrobe-street,
was, of course, the first superintendent.
On some Australian artists abroad :
Sid Long, who has been made an Associate of the
Royal Society of Painter-etchers, is the first Aus-
tralian to get this distinction. There is a slump in
painting in London and a boom in etchings, and
Sid may have foreseen this when he forsook oils for
the more exacting copper-plate. When you paint a
subject in oils you can only sell it once, but from
the etched plate you can sell up to 75 prints; so
if an etcher can demand £lO for a print he has the
chance of making £750 from a plate. Men like
James Mcßey, D. G. Cameron and Muirhead Bone
have made fortunes out of etchings, the first-named
having realised as high as £250 for a single print.
G. W. Lambert, who was the official artist with the
A.I.F. in Palestine, and who is returning to Aus-
tralia, hopes to visit the scenes of his youth, near
Warren, on the Macquarie River. It was in this
district that he got his subject for “Across the
Black-soil Plains.” He first exhibited at a little
art show at Bowral; it was a water-color he painted
while staying at a local station. Referring to those
days, he told me that he had never ceased to wonder
why the hanging committee of the Royal Art Society
did not refuse his first offering. “It was a fear-
some thing,” exclaimed the artist. “The subject
was a horse and cart, and the latter was pure
Reckitts, straight from the packet.”
Harold Parker, the Queensland sculptor, is also re-
turing to Australia. He had his hour of triumph when
the trustees of the Chantrey Bequest bought his
“Ariadne” for £lOOO for the Tate Gallery. There
are three Australians represented at the Tate, all
sculptors, the other two being Bertram Mackennal,
A.R.A., and C. Web Gilbert. Strange to say, Parker
is not represented in any gallery but the one in
Brisbane. He has shown frequently at the R.A.
and at the Paris Salon, where his Prometheus Bound
was awarded a mention honorable.
t- Starrett, the boyish-looking and popular
L.S.A. consul at Adelaide, has been moved
on to Java, this being to American ideas a
rise in station from S.A.; at any rate, it is
BAMFORD , N.P. (Q.), “ Father ” of
the Reps.
better paid. Starrett’s record of service has
been mostly in tropical countries, and he de-
serves to stay in a decent climate. Uncle
Sam, by the way, has only four consuls in
Australia (as distinct from mere consular
agents, who are mostly local business men
obliging the U.S.A. as a side-line). They
are located at Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide
and Newcastle.
Dick Gill, who flitted to Sliadowland last
week after a long illness, was one of the
most likeable of Vic. union secretaries. He
never got flustered, even when he knew the
numbers were against him, and had a knack of
relieving the gloom of defeat with a witty
flash. Dick was allowed a good deal of his
own way as sec. of the Federated Liquor
Trades Union, and the salary was generous.
He was twice Mayor of Port Melbourne.
Ex-Premier “Jimmy” McGowen (N.S.W.)
retains one link with celebrity. Last week
he was elected superintendent of St. Paul’s,
Itedfcrn (Sydney) Sunday-school for the
34th successive year.
Rev. W. 11. Howard, the new president of
the Methodist body in N. S, Wales, was 40
years ago a watchmaker and jeweller at
Cobar. He joined the “connection” in 1885,
and has toiled in the vineyard up north as
well as in the Ma State.
A. R. Outtrim, who was the heavy father
of the Vic. Assembly until he was outed at
Maryborough (Vic.) last October, is to have
a golden wedding, on Monday. The patriarch
is 75, but still feels good enough for another
30 years in the political game.
“Copabella”: Something out of the way
occurred on Feb. 14 at the small Vic. school
of Waurn Ponds, near Geelong, when Lewis
Walter visited the school and gave the chil-
dren a short lecture on its history. The occa-
sion was the 50th anniversary of the school’s
opening, and the speaker was the man who,
at 22, was its first teacher.
Presumably the Duke of Connaught was
sent to inaugurate the Indian Parliaments,
amid a community that was in a very nasty
temper, because he is the cheapest uncle
that George V. possesses. Since the Sarajevo
incident six years ago high-priced princes
have been carefully guarded. Connaught is
a long way out of the line of succession to
the throne, and being 71 years old he is prac-
tically a worked-out deposit.
“Homo”: Dr. A. A. Brown, sometime
superintendent of the Green vale (Vic.) sana-
torium, has gone over the hill. Son of plain
John Brown, of Brunswick, he was a clerk
in the Vic. Postal Department when medi-
cine attracted him. He toiled for a small
salary at night, and studied in the day-
time. After qualifying he joined the
Agricultural Department, and was for
years Superintendent of Foods for Ex-
port, his official domicile being in the
dismal old Lonsdale-street edifice, which
later the Health Department ran as a tuber-
culosis bureau, and later still as a V.D.
clinic. Then he went to Green vale. Brown
was a ready and sparkling speaker, especially
in recalling the vanished years, and when-
ever the departmental staff foregathered
round the convivial board he didn’t allow
things to flag for want of reminiscence.
TO THE LADY WHO RUSHES THE
SMOKING-CAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lady in the smoking-car,
Oft I wonder what you are,
Whether you desire to be
With male persons knee to knee
Merely on the general plan
Of your tenderness for man.
Do you feel that you must breathe
Incense that the smokers wreathe
Round their language, muted still
Lest its sound should make you ill ?
Do you come within this car
Just to smell a bad cigar ?
Do you enter in with pride,
Glad that you are no man’s bride?
Does your tilted nose explain
Something of your large disdain
For the trousered folk who blow
Capstan solace as they go?
Or is it the simple case
That you always lose your place,
Merely fuss and flop and fall,
Squatting anywhere at all?
Is it true you never know
Where you are or how you go?
Lady in the smoking-car,
One thing certainly you are;
Be your motive what it may,
This is plain as washing-day.
Reason calls aloud to rhyme
You’re a nuisance ’all the time.

“Audio”: In the Army it was a good plan
to own portable property of cotmmercial
value. Every time Ted received money
from home, he would invest half m a gold
wristlet watch, a silver cigarette case or
some .such article. Then when the other
half of the remittance was spent and fellows
began to press for repayment of borrowed
francs, he commenced to convert
the articles purchased into cash,
having, as he explained, the plea-
sure of owning and using them in
the meantime. He fcontinued this
method till one day he looted a
fine pair of Zeiss field-glasses from
a prisoner. The next dry spell he
put them up for raffle, offering to
buy the goods from the winner for
£5. The raffle brought £l5, so
that, after getting back the glasses
he showed a net gain of £lO. This
raffle came off eight times to my
knowledge. It was always a sure
thing at a hospital or base depot,
and could safely be repeated at
intervals with the unit, the per-
.sonnel of which was constantly changing.
As a means of revenue it was even more
profitable than a thorough knowledge of
two-up.
* * * *
“Titchi”: The midday train to Sandring-
ham (Vic.) was overcrowded as usual. In
the carriage all the male passengers, with
the exception of one small boy, aged about
10, had risen in favor of the women. The
youngster was far too deeply buried in a novel
to notice that there were ladies standing.
At times his eyes would almost start out of
his head, and he would roqk with glee. As
the train came to a standstill at Rich-
mond, a dear old soul scrambled into our
compartment, and the urchin, directing his
gaze from his book for the first time, jumped
up and tendered his seat. As he rose I
glanced at the cover of his novel. It was
entitled “Should a Girl Be Kept in Igno-
rance?”
* * * *
“Copabella”: The client explained that
Mrs. Huggins had insulted her, and demanded
the lawyer’s aid in “ ’avin’ the lor o’ ” the
calumniator. “Insult?” she shrilled., in answer
to Gent. One’s inquiry. “Why, she said I’d
’ad a kid before I was married!” “And
hadn’t you?” said the Law’s anointed. “Oh.
as far as that goes,” replied the lady, “I’d
’ad three —‘but what business is it o’ ’Ug-
gins’s?” Without venturing upon the ethics
of the matter, the lawyer decided to give it
a fly, and sent a cold, high-toned letter to
Mrs. Huggins. Waiting for him on his door-
mat next morning was Mrs. Huggins, agi-
tated and voluble. She tendered an apology,
lawyer’s expenses and costs, and damages
in reason; was shrived and sped home a
chastened soul. Thus again did Virtue
triumph over the base lies of the scandal-
monger !
* * * *
“Orwell”: The Hotel Blank is a place
where peaches are to be gathered—pot
plucked. They do the plucking. Chump
strolled in one afternoon and chummed up
with a beautiful stranger who permitted
him to buy cocktails for her consumption.
They had taken perhaps three or four, and
the youth was commencing to feel senti-
mental, when he became uncomfortably con-
scious of a pair of eyes gazing from the
other side of the lounge at his companion.
“That man’s staring at you,” he said. “Oh,
don’t bother about him,” the lady replied.
But the cocktails and the stranger’s intru-
sive behavior fired Chump’s blood, and he
strode across the room to demand an
explanation. “What do you mean by star,
ing at my lady friend?” he roared, towering
over the weary little man. “Can’t I look
at my own wife?” the other protested. “I’m
waiting to take her home. I do wish she’d
hurry.”
* * * *
“Tuart”: The hearts of the flappers in
my neighborhood have been withered by the
intelligence from America that Constance
Talmadge, the “film star,” is married, and to
a Greek. Yes, a Greek, one Papalog, or some
such name, has gathered the fair Constance
in the garden of greasepaint girls, and there
is mourning in Marrickville and desolation
at Brighton Beach. The press-agent, honest
man, has tried to soften the blow. With a
melancholy appearance of confidence which
ill conceals the despair in his heart, he asserts
that Connie’s husband is “the son of a
wealthy tobacco-planter” and “a lineal
descendant of Michael Palaeologus, the By-
zantine Emperor,” but it won’t do. In the
collective mind of this nation there is no
room for romance on the subject of modern
Greeks; all the modern Greeks Australia
knows are uninteresting aliens who hawk
fruit for a, living and keep fishshops. One
visualises Mr. Papalog as a swarthy, ges-
ticulating youth, with pimples and oiled
hair and associates him with banal
images of fried shark, crayfish, stout-and-
.oysters and specked fruit. It is a painful
subject. And for the moment the flapper’s
mind is tortured by a horrid doubt whether
the promoted factory-girls and circus clowns
of American filmdom are really the magnifi-

tary titles are indicated on it, and no decora-
tions. Among the “A’s” comes Amphleby,
the boss—43 years of age and a lieut.-colonel
when the war began. He did 27 trips on
transports as C.O. troops, and got himself de-
mobilised in time to evade the serious part of
the submarine campaign. Two or three
places lower down is Appot, D.C.M.,
M.M. He wasn’t exactly sacked for enlist-
ing. but he found bis job filled when he came
back and he went elsewhere. Blinks was an
equipment officer in the Flying Corps. Three
years in a pleasant English town constituted
his bid for fame. Bloggs, the next man, was
wounded in the stomach at the Gallipoli
Landing, and returned from France in 1918
blind in both eyes. Clamp was a Red Cross
colonel. Clump is the V.C. Opposite the
name of Darker is the cross which stands
for “killed.” He fell at Hooge. It is also
opposite the name of old Dunkee, Colonel
Amphleby’s brother-in-law, who, after a right
merry time as a Comforts Fund officer at
Cairo, London and Le Havre, died of alco-
holic poisoning on his way home to Austra-

lia. Flibbs was in the A.S.C. (Motor Trans-
port) ; Flupton in the infantry (twice
wounded). Forpington served as a “Jack”
till 1917, when the authorities began sending
this arm overseas. He then developed an
old-standing trouble —weeping eczema of the
shin-bone —in an intolerable form, and was
returned ,to Australia. Fulford got a D.S.O.
for work in the field. Gumpers also got one
—for work in an office. In short, the con-
traption announces in imperishable marble
that Brown was the equal of Smith, and that
all were heroes and patriots, whereas the
truth —well, the truth about some of them
would disclose a self-seeking spirit of caution
calculated to shame a Bengalee.

“10-2-4” on the Decline and Fall of
Prayer:—•
1 It is an odd commentary on the modern attitude
towards religion that practically always when a pro-
minent character turns desperately to his faith for
solace or inspiration he is accused of being a maniac.
The charge of religious mania made against Lenin
last week —he disproved it, incidentally, by the un-
Christian act of suspending the Moscow newspaper
which originated the libel —was freely levelled at the
late Czar and also at his wife. Just before the
Armistice, when the whole world suddenly knew
Germany was about to fall, the London Daily Mail
published an item over the scare-heading:—•
The Iyaisek Mad.
Spends Hours Praying for the Dynasty.
It is allowable to pray for Divine forgiveness after
a sinful interlude, or for one’s enemies, or even for
rain—though in the last connection' the logical thing,
as was pointed out in The Bulletin years ago, is
to pray for the mountains which bring rain. But
the moment a man betrays that he really believes
in a beneficent Creator, believes in Him as he
does in the existence of his own father, at that
instant he is diagnosed as mad.
In 1917 a curate in England lost his bicycle. It
was a serious matter for him, and be asked' his con-
gregation to join him in prayers for its return.
The papers took it up, and for a week or so it
was a toss-up whether he would be inhibited by his
bishop or removed by the civil authorities to an
asylum. However, the trouble died down, and he
reverted to the permissible practice of praying for
the Allies to win the war.
There were no such limitations in the so-called
Dark Ages. Men prayed to be cured of the plague
or the king’s evil (specifying the trouble in order
that there might be no celestial mistake on the
subject), for a safe journey from one country to
another, and for the death of tyrants. True, tyrants
were occasionally murdered, but that only proves
that there are sceptics in all ages. Who in our
time ever hears of a social purity expert praying
for some change in Nature that would make surf-
bathing impossible? Or a prohibitionist praying for
disease in grapes or hops ? Or an anti-gambler call-
ing down Heaven’s maledictions on bookmakers ?
Such things simply aren’t done any more. The
spirit is willing enough, but the faith in the effi-
cacy of prayer is weak. And as a further check
to spirituality there is the knowledge that a chorus
of “Maniac” will follow any such act—a haunting
fear that religion, unless handled with conventional
abstraction, may bring the devotee before a specialist
in mental diseases.

Alfred, the educated house-breaker,
explains how he got the gold and precious
stones of Israel:—
I had it from the inside that the stuff was in
the house, and one
night I walked in
through a balcony win-
dow and skimmed the
rooms, but didn’t get
enough for a tram fare.
A week later Mr. Israel
awoke, by request, to
find a helmeted fire-
man in the room along
with a judicious sup-
ply of smoke and a
convincing smell of
fire. The fireman
uttered a timely warn-
ing, and retired. He
saw through the not-
quite-elosed door an
agitated Jewish gentle-
man lift a flap of wall-
paper, remove a neat
slab of cement and take
from an admirably-con-
trived recess a small
Japanned box. Then
the fireman reappeared,
seized Israel’s box of
assortments and two
pillows and rushed out,
carelessly locking the*
door behind him. That
fireman coup was good
for eleven hundred net.
I never found it work
so well again.
“Fax”: Baldwin Spencer, who has done
good work for Australian artists (and him-
self) as a buyer and seller of Australian
pictures, is worrying his co-trustees of Mel-
bourne National Gallery to bring about a
periodical interchange of works of art be-
tween Sydney and Melbourne Galleries. On
the principle, presumably, that three movings
are as bad as a fire, the other trustees, are
not keen on the Professor’s project, nor is
there anything to be said for it which
couldn’t be pleaded on behalf of an inter-
change between the collections at Dresden
and Munich, or the British National Gal-
lery and the Louvre. This is not yet such
an art-loving people that any State Gallery
trustees need scheme to get their treasures
carted around the continent at the grave risk
of destruction. Not having learned to think
of paintings as being very valuable for
High Art’s sake, the railway porters are in-
sufficiently “advanced” to take charge of a
Corot. There is another objection. Mel-
bourne Gallery is blessed with a splendid
endowment, of which the effects must surely
be felt, sooner or later. Why share the fruits
of Felton’s bequest with Sydney, and thus
discourage the posthumous generosity of
some Sydney art-lover who might otherwise

cost you.”
feel inspired to follow Felton’s dead? And
why send pictures on tour before they have
been even seen or spoken of by half a million
of local residents ? Create new art-lovers.
Don’t go chasing the old ones.
BETTER NOT.

The little lady sitting opposite me
Has a roving glance that sets rny dreams a-Winking.
I was exceedingly composed until it hit l rte
And quite my scheme of ordered thinking.
She is high-spirited and has dared to flout the
fashion:
A frilly ruff hides her white neck completely.
Her eyes, contemptuous-soft, have no compassion.
She’s neatly shod, and stockinged very sweetly.
Her skirts are longer than the others wear ’em,
More than a dainty ankle scarce disclosing.
The hidden charms allure, and she won’t here ’em,
This subtle dear. While I pretend to be dozing s
And through dropped lids spy on her very gladly,
I see her eyes rest on me in appraising.
Her mischief-imps set my imps dancing madtly,
Yet somehow chill me though the day is blfczing.
I frankly own I’d love to pull that ruff off
And kiss the throat that glistens through it
faintly.
I’d love to draw free breath, and laugh, and puff off
My moral qualms. (To-day I am not saintly.)
I’d love, indeed, to clasp her close, to sqaeeze her
Until khe crooned, to kiss and coax and pet her;
But if for always I had to hold and please her,
I fear me I’d be sorry that I met her.
Still as she sits there with her imps all working,
The sinful man I am would like . Your
pardon !
Some truth's a prudent man must e’en be shirking
When he talks of the god that haunts the garden.
The little lady sitting opposite me
Has a roving glance that sets my dreams to
winking.
I flinch and quiver when her glances hfit me;
But she’s too heady stuff for me, I’m thinking.

THE COLUMBIA GRAFONOLA stays the hand of Time. It combines with
a Columbia Record to perpetuate the brain and throat of the Master-
musician. Though he die—in the mortal sense—he will always live while
they exist.
Formerly, the art of the musician had no permanence. His greatest achievement
was, for the world, but the pleasure of the moment. When his powers declined,
or his eyes closed in the Great Sleep, he left us nothing but remembrance.
Shakespeare writes, and his work endures. Da Vinci paints or Angelo carves,
and they are with us for all time—deathless in their creations. But the musicians!
Where are the Pattis and the Linds ? But names—or the memories that stir
an old man’s heart.
To-day, in a Columbia Record, the maker of music remains imperishable. His
mortal frame must pay its toll to Time. But his wonderful art —his living tones
—are preserved for us by the Grafonola, while we have ears to hear.
The Columbia Grafonola is every man’s diversion. It lays under tribute the
whole realm of music—from the compositions of lofty Parnassus to the bizarre
melodies that have set countless feet abeat on the cabaret floor.

“Hamer”: It must be getting quite the
proper thing. A woman seeking advice came
to see me t’other day, dragging after her an
embarrassed individual who hung vaguely
and superfluously in the offing while she
talked. Something in her story prompting
the question, I asked if the man was her
husband. _ “Oh, no!” she said, “but ’e will
be. ’E’s goin’ to marry me when my ’usband
.gits a divorce.”
* * * *
4 Dido”: When the home of a Melbourne
suburban doctor was burgled the other day
the thieves looted everything, including a
■nano. The carpets were taken from the
door and the curtains from the windows.
It recalls a robbery at Sydney a few years
ago,' when Sikes departed with one local
artist’s pictures and left those of another.
The man whose paintings were undisturbed
[protested he was the victim of of a grave
injustice, and one that would do him an
injury with local buyers. The other fellow
complacently observed that while almost
any artist could find buyers, he was of the
distinguished few considered good enough to
be stolen. Then the robbed householder
uound a note on the shelf over the drawing-
room fireplace: “Pictures taken out of kind-
ness.” The painter of the stolen master-
pieces still maintains that the rival artist
bribed someone to put that note there.
* * * *
. “Sixenate”: The pie-stall habit is return-
ing to Sydney. The war, by taking away
the young bloods who used to “knock round
town,” lessened the demand for stewed steak,
‘‘sets of smalls,” “half-and-half” and
stewed ladies”— i.e., tongues—and six
o’clock closing finished the business as far
as several well-known cafes-de-gutter—
:'Deluding Ted Slattery’s ’Ole in the Wall—

Anow where to get the beer in spite of

of the average city restaurant has also
helped. So all the close-to-city suburbs have
regained their coffee-stalls—usually built
inside a hoarding, and kept scrupulously
clean —and the “fifteen-penny-touch” is satis-
fying and popular.

MARGERY ( just home from ladies' college):

MAMMA ( regarding her suspiciously) : “Mar-
gery, you didn't kiss with that burrow-

body with a moustache!"
‘Henry Pippin”: A Melbourne citizen has
discovered what it feels like to own a pass-
able resemblance to a public personage.
Motoring in the hills after a downpour, his
ear got bogged in a gully, and he had to
tramp a considerable -distance to a farm to
borrow horses and tackle to pull the vehicle
out. As the horses were working behind the
plough, their owner reckoned that a fiver
would be necessary to repay him for the
labor and loss of time, and he mentioned
firmly that he wanted the cash in advance.
The car-owner hadn’t the coin, but promised
to send the urgent farmer a cheque. “No,
that won’t do,” said the cautious cocky.
“You're a bit too long-winded to suit me,
Mr. - J ,” mentioning the personage’s name.
DESPERATE PLIGHT OF A GREENGROCER ON FINDING THAT HE HAS

And, despite the visitor’s anguished protests,
he had to pay for the resemblance in cash
borrowed from his passengers before he could
start for home.
“Spare Dig.” : One Digger at least sprang
from the rank of private to that of General
in a single day. Coming across a General’s
tunic and hat minus the General, he was
seized by a mad desire to have one crowded
hour of glorious life as an army chief. It
certainly was a crowded hour. The “Jacks”
in the Strand were given the tip that a
General had gone mad, and when they dis-
covered General Bill from Boggabri suffering
ladies of the half-world to wear his badges
and inviting them to drink at his expense
they ran him in for impersonating an officer.
But nothing very terrible happened to him
—perhaps because he was able to name the
gilded hall of impropriety where he had
picked up the loose tunic. It was evident
that the real General didn’t want much said
about the matter, and justice was satisfied
by his locum tenens being hurried back to
France.

A voice from a Sydney suburb: —
One day last week I received intimation that
the ice supply was stopped, and that in future all
meat would go bad with impunity. I was told the
same day that the milk supply had stopped, so the
baby can go bad. I can’t go somewhere that I want
to go to on urgent business because the steamers
have stopped. In summer the water stops where I
live, because the service is rotten. In winter the
electric radihtor is stopped—l suppose because the
Corporation is rotten. I can’t get a telephone in
my new house because the supply is stopped, or, at
least, run short. There are two families in the
house —I took the other one in, it being stranded
because the building of houses for rent is stopped.
But for the repairs done out of loans at about
£6OOO per mile —much more than the cost of a
new railway—road traffic out of Sydney would be
stopped. There is a stop-work meeting going on
rouffd the corner. I believe this State has run down
and is due to be wound up.
* * # *
“Attaboy”: I wonder if my friend Snowy
was aboard the Bahia Castillo, which
brought the last load of A.I.F. blokes back
from Britain. Because the Strand ladies
took such an interest in him when he was
cashed up, Snowy decided to wear his wel-
come out by remaining in London. He
used to track a pretty little bride about the
Smoke, and there was a flat in Soho. Snowy
got his ticket in April, 1919, and while his
deferred pay lasted he reckoned he wouldn’t
go back to Aussie if you paid him. He was
still smiling when he watched the mob
clear out from Sutton Veny and Codford and
embark for home. When X got back to
London at the end of that year I met Snowy
outside the Beaver Hut in the Strand. By
this time most of the ladies who used to
act as trench (or extra-trench) comforts
had been demobilised. There were no more
Diggers, and consequently no more money.
“It’s a fair cow,” growled Snowy, “The
English,” he added, “are the biggest lot
of blanks I ever knew.” After his deferred
pay went he cabled home for £lOO, which he
and his bride split up inside a month. She
disappeared with the last fiver. When I
heard of the Diggers starving in London I
could not forget poor old Snowy—one of the
many Australians who didn’t have the sense
to realise that for them it was a case of
“apres la guerre—finis.”
* * * * *
“Centurion”: When “Pip” asserts (B.
17/2f'2l) that the British Army is an ass
for retaining the sword, he generalises
over-haati'ly. It does not follow because the
“white arm” was not needed on the Western
Front that it was superfluous everywhere
else. Allenby, a good and experienced
judge, thought it necessary to issue swords
to the Light Horse in Palestine, and his
action was justified on many occasions. The
long, edgeless, thrusting epee used by the
British cavalry needs very little handling to
become quite useful to intelligent people.
There is only one point and guard in the
“drill.” It is dangerous to assert that any
weapon is obsolete and useless. Writer has
heard a naval uncle condemn the Chinese
use of chemical stinkpots in the ’sixties,
but the Hun improved on the stinkpot with
terrible effect in 1915. On Gallipoli Major.
Midgely. of the sth L. 11., employed a
bow and arrows with burning tow attached
to light up No Man’s Land when Verey lights
were scarce, and very effectual the mediaeval
dodge was. Writer’s Boer War' contem-
poraries concluded that the bayonet was
down and out for ever after that show. The
reformer who cut the Grenadiers’ special
drill out of the book in the ’sixties (“Open
your pouches,” “Light your fuses,” and so
on) no doubt reckoned it was gone for good.
Yet bayonet and bomb, by themselves and
in combination, had a lot of good hunting
in the 1914-18 argument. So did the spiked
club and the dagger of mercy, which wise-
acres thought had not survived the Wars
of the Roses. Even the good old boot had
a look in occasionally, to say nothing of
catapults, arbalests and the tortoise —other-
wise the tank.

“Murkah” on the new marvels of wire-
less telegraphy:—
Up-to-date radio science has produced two remark-
able machines. One is an engine with a speed so
enormous that mere friction with the atmosphere
produced effects (heat, etc.) that seriously impaired
its efficiency. Now this five-ton mass of wire whirls
llfOO miles per hour (at its outside edge) in a
vacuum as nearly absolute as the best air-pump
machinery can make it. It is used for transmission,
and so constant is its rotation (steady within one-
tenth part of one per cent.) and so sensitive its
construction that it can also be used as a wireless
telephone transmitter, carefully noting as it flys
the minute vibrations and waves that make the
human voice. It sits at the foot of a 1000 ft. tower
at Nauen, Germany, and is the only one of its
wonderful kind in existence—an individual and a
species. True, it has three near relations, but no
brothers.
The other is a mite of a thing, about 3in. long,
not unlike an electric-light bulb —the remarkable
audion detector that hangs quietlv on the front
of the receiver. Of all things electric, the audion
is most sensitive. Even the 600-h.p. engine that
still can note and fling a child’s whisper round the
world ranks behind the audion. Imagine an up-to-
date ship’s radio outfit transmitting in (sav) the
Indian Ocean. Approximately five horse-power is sent
out. Those five horses spread themselves over the
Indian Ocean from top to bottom and sideways
They climb the Himalayas, explore Antarctic ice-
fields and permeate Africa. With giant strides they
cover the map of Australia and the Tasman far
beyond.
Imagine how incalculably tiny a proportion of
power reaches one point (say, Sydney Radio) 3000
miles away. It appears ridiculous to claim that
such an attenuated wisp of energy could be recorded
But the wonderful audion takes hold of it, builds
it up, and at that range delivers good signals. Where
signals are too weak a series of audions can be used,
each “boosting” the energy and passing it on. Up
to eight steps of amplification have been used; the
process is termed “cascading.” For a time' the
audion defeated itself by amplifying static (atmo-
sphere disturbance) as well as the signal; but the
restless Yank has solved that problem.

“McNorth” recalls a poet:—
They’ve a memory of Rupert Brooke in Fiji. The
poet, vvho was on a world-saunter, stayed a while
in Suva, and the private secretary to the then Gov-
ernor, a most unliterary personage, got his Ex. to in-
vite the you-ng man to dinner. Brooke, the most casual
of youths, arrived on the verandah of Government
House wearing a very travel-worn suit, with hat
and boots to match, and smoking a vile-smelling
pipe. There is a view from that verandah, a won-
derful vista of sea, reef and palm, and while the
Governor and his women-folk were waiting on the
verandah to receive the guest Brooke tarried to gaze
at it. As the secretary began the introductions, the
poet drew his attention to the beauty of the scene
before them. He discoursed on the glories of the
blending blues and greens and the way the rollers
tripped over the reef. Those things were ever so
much more to him than the stiff, formal people
waiting ,to say “Pleased to meet you” and not
meaning it; and for the time he thought of nothing
else. However, the introductions were managed at
last, and were followed by a meal at which the
only person at his , ease was the poet. But after-
wards when Brooke had gone, the Governor called
the secretary to him. “Young man,” he said, “if
you bring any more people like that here you’ll
leave with them. Why, damme, sir, that fellow
has no respect for rank!”
* * * *
“Spare Corp” : Sometimes a personal para-
graphs dwells fondly on the fact that some-
body or another “fought in four wars and
never got a scratch.” I met a lot of old
soldiers in the A.1.F., and, with some excep-
tions, their dexterity in getting a hammerlock
on home-camp jobs or soft, menial foreign
positions far away from the fighting-line was
marvellous. In fact, I am convinced that
some of these ancient men-at-arms might
fight in 50 wars and not get a scratch —
except from the insects perennially associated
with hostilities. Take my friend Eyescraper,
whose manly breast is a regular rainbow dis-
play on ceremonial occasions. In intervals
between peeling spuds in the depot cook-
house he used to tell us bloodthirsty yarns
about how he and others, being without food
on a lonely patrol, supported life by eating
portion of a deceased Cape boy, and how in
India having accidentally killed a native
soldier in a street brawl, he had polished off
five other eye-witnesses by way of removing
the evidence. Leaving the cookhouse, Eye-
scraper was made batman to the C.O. When
he lost that job he came back to the cook-
house again. In France he rose to be
sergeant-cook to a back-of-the-line unit, and
A LITTLE TO GO ON WITH.
“Yes, I proposed to her and she's decided to
give it a go—on one condition."
“What's that?"
“That she doesn't get a better offer between
now and Christmas!"
I have heard that, he told it blood-curdling
narratives about his adventures in previous
wars. But a man who had served in
Africa and had not got off without a scratch
arrived one day and identified him. He said
that even in the old Boer War days the
voluble hero was known as “Spuds.”
NIGHT-ERRANT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Grey, spectacled, with shoulders round,
Day-long to dreary ledgers bound,
How meek, how dull a thing he seelns t
But who shall read another’s dreams?
His is a soul as high and bold
As any blazing knight’s of old.
His secret motto this, no less:
“I succour Beauty in Distress.”
For when frail loveliness he sees
Assailed by horned enemies,
He knows the helpless, lilies stand
Like fettered maidens in a band,
And through the midnight lone and dim,
With lamp in hand, with courage grim,
With strong right foot that never fails
He sallies forth to slaughter snails.

MISSIONER: “How did your husband meet
his death?”
THE LADY: “ ’E took a drop too much.”
MISSIONER : "What, did he drink himself
to death?”
THE LADY: “No, ’e ’ung ’imself.”
“Boondah”: “Golub” says (B. 27/l/’21)95
per cent, of deaths from the bites of Australian
reptiles are the result of shock. I was just
off to muster the Green Hill paddock, but
I must chip in here first. I have known a five-
year-old bullock die in 20 minutes from the death-
adder’s bite. I settled a big tiger-snake a few
months ago and didn t wait to pulverise his head
and on passing that way next day I found the tiger
quite dead and, likewise, not more than four yards
away, a Hereford heifer that had been unwise enough
to inquire as to his ailment. I have seen fangs
on the dried remains of adders fully fin. long, and
if one gets a fair bite, on a bare-legged child,
the situation is more serious than “Colub” would
have us believe. However, his vipership soon dis-
appears as population increases. His cussedness
about moving out of one’s way is his doom.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: An almost universal bush
belief is that if a bullock is worked alongside a
bull in a team for any length of time he will
quickly break up and die. Have always noticed that
if a bullocky has a bull in his team he usually
works him in the pole and is careful to change his
mate every few days. . Can any Abo. explain?
* * * *
“Boomerang”: Can kangaroos swim (B.
6/1/T2l) ? This absurd question always tickles my
funny-bone. No Abo.-man that has lived out back
could deny it. Kangaroos can most certainly swim,
but they do it only with great difficulty and when
it is impossible to escape the ordeal. Ask anyone
who was on the Darling in the big flood of ’9l. I
saw hundreds of them swimming the river then.
They swim in an upright position. Throw a kan-
garoo-dog into a dam and you will get an exact
replica of their method. The yarn that the ’roo
is all right so long as it doesn’t get its ears wet
is all bosh.
* * * *
“Noyjis Homo”: One of our Binghis, sus-
pecting black Maria’s lapse from the straight and
narrow moral path, turned to a group of stockmen
standing near and in wild tones exclaimed: “My
word, mine thinkit I bin father Tonga you boys
too long plurry time!”
* * » *
“Euro”: When wild things are perishing
for food and water they lose all fear and all pre-
judices. Travelling with pack-horses one bad drought
I pulled up for a dinner camp at a clump of mulgas,
and under the scanty shade of one tree I saw a
big ’roo flat out to it, and whistling dolorously. I
made the fire and began to fill the quartpots from
the watercans. The sound of the pouring water
aroused the old ’roo, and he came hopping over, and
stood to attention beside me. I offered him a' quart
and held the pot while he drank. Finishing, he
thumped back to his shade and resumed his siesta.

“Bad Australian”: The Victorian School
Paper (l/2/’2l) tells young Australia about the
wombat:—
When in the course of his travels he comes upon
a river or a dam, he does not take the trouble to
walk round or swim across, but quietly walks into
the water and along the bottom until he comes out
at the other side.
I have killed hundreds of wombats and dissected a
few, but have never struck a specimen furnished with
gills, nor have I ever known one of these animals to
take to water, even when pushed to the last ex :
tremity by dogs. Seems to me the School Paper
yarn requires confirmation.
“Billy T.”: Shaddock said he lost his wife
last year when the ’flu was “goin’ round plentiful.”
He was sitting on his plough-handles, and the furrow
was waiting. “She died of the influenza ?” I asked.
“Well, no, she didn’t die—not to say died,” said
Shaddock. “She went off—went off with
Pete Farmer, the engineer from Kelly’s mill.
Oh, a real decent sorter man,” added Shad-
dock hastily. “She couldn’t have picked a
better.” He shook his horses up again. When
next he came back abreast of where I sat
fishing he paused to add, “I will say of Mrs.
Shaddock she was a woman of great judg-
ment.” “Must be a comfort to you to
know she’s in such good hands,” said I. Shad-
dock had no suspicion of sarcasm. “That’s
right,” said he. “It’s better for her. Milkin’
never suited them lungs of hers.” He
did another length of the paddock,
then continued; “Mrs. Farmer, she
helped me out with the milkin’,” and
whipped up his horses. The next
furrow contributed: “Mrs. Farmer
agrees it’s better for Milly to have
Pete, her lungs bein’ what they was.”
I didn’t get the next instalment till
five furrows had been ploughed. Then
Shaddock said: “Mrs. Farmer and me,
we don’t begrudge Pete nothin’, every-
thin’ bein’ so much better for Milly.”
Finally: “We’re both so glad to think
it’s healthy fer Milly we wouldn’t
have her back if we could —me and Norah wouldn’t.”

“Eryander”: The wedge-tailed eagle
(“Euro,” B. 3/2/’2l) may not carry off lambs, but
I have known one collar a dog. On a station in
N.-W. Vic. the boss’s wife had some yapping little
goggle-eyed spaniels, and one of them, while snooz-
ing in the sun within a few yards of the verandah,
was grabbed by an eagle and deported. His yowl-
ing gave the alarm, but there was no time to get a
gun. On the same station I came upon three eagles
shepherding a small patch of dense scrub, and dart-
ifig in at times towards a particular spot, from
which something unseen appeared to drive them each
time. I had a Winchester, and, after dropping all
three, I investigated and found that the occupier
of the patch was a dingo slut. At sight of me she
broke cover, as if to make off; then suddenly
turned back and got a bullet in the ribs that floored
her. Poking into the scrub, I found three quarter-
grown puppies huddled-up in a little hollow. How
the eagles knew they were there is a puzzle, but
the mother had evidently been defending them.
“Jim Carew”: Was recently a spectator
at an “all-in” scrap between a four-foot brown
snake and a big gohanna. It lasted nearly five min-
utes. They stood up to each other in fine style and
neither gave much ground. The snake kept on
striking with lightning-like rapidity, but the go.,
taking little notice, struck but seldom, and when
he did he left his mark. At last he secured a throat
grip, and although the snake coiled round him in a
last desperate struggle, it was no use, and in less
than a minute after the go. got his throat hold the
snake was dead. Out of curiosity I caught the go.,
carried him home, and kept him under observation
for over four hours. But although I had seen the
snake strike at him over 50 times, and in about six
places the skin was slightly torn, he showed no
symptoms of snake poisoning, and when I let him
out he made for the bush as if nothing was wrong.
Is the go. immune from the effects of snake-poison,
or is his hide too touglf for the snake to bite
through ?
MERELY A PLEASURE TRIP.
LOQUACIOUS NGISANCE NEXT DOOR:
“What, moving, Jones?”
THE PERSPIRING JONES: “Moving, no-o!
Just taking my blanky furniture out for
a bit of a ride.”
If “Yacko” (B. 6/l/’2l)
means that he knows a station where a ram tipped
280 ewes in one night, I say it is not- a record—
it’s a lie.

: Re “T.E.A.’s” Warenda light
(B. 27/l/’2l). While riding on a bicycle along
the road from Evandale to Youngtown, through the
White Hills (X. Tas.), on a dark night, there
suddenly appeared a bright light on my side of road
a few yards in front. I applied the brake to avert
an accident, but the light moved in a flash to a
position about 50 yards to my left, in a paddock
on the bank of a creek running parallel with the
road. Here it stayed for some minutes, then
flashed to another position some hundreds of yards
away. On making inquiries I found the light to
be familiar to local residents as will-o’-the-wisp. It
was caused through the rising of sulphuric gases
from the damp ground on creek bank, which con-
tained a large percentage of magnesia. Since then
I have seen as many as four of these lights at one
time in the same locality.
* * * *
“H.Q.”: The threadbare notion that
rodents do not like cold, barren wastes was blown
to pieces recently when the Tararua (M.L.) Tramp-
ing Club climbed Tapuaenuku, the bleakest peak
in the Kaikouras, and found the climbing records
nibbled to shreds to make a comfy mouse home.
The residence was 10,000 ft. above sea level.
* * * *
“Fenstanton”: “Ida 0.,” writing about
the best roughriders (B. 11/11/’2O), mentions
Snowy Baldwin’s failure to sit Major Blakeley’s stal-
lion. Why quote Baldwin at all? He was no
topnotcher. Further, a bareback, affair on a pony
is no evidence of a man’s ability to ride a 16-hand
outlaw with seven devils inside him and a forked-
lightning twist on' landing. The best roughrider in
Australia is a very large order. “Ida O.” says
she can name four. She’s a marvel. At a great
buck jumping competition at the exhibition arena
in Melbourne some months ago, about 30 riders
competed. To judge who was the best was impos-
sible, for to the onlooker the best riders got the
easiest horses, and the rest couldn’t sit the best
of a very poor lot. Of riders of 40 to 50 years
ago, Bob Lidgerwood (the saleyards rider at Gee-
long), was a superb horseman, and was only excelled
in grace and balance by Clarrie Lancaster, of Little
River (Vic.). Dwyer, of Co'otamundra, a great rider
but too rough, and Jimmy and Jack Moore, of Dur-
ham Ox, were famous in the saddle. But the abso-
lute championship must go to the twin-brothers
Fawcett, a pair of athletes just under 10 stone each.
At a great Albury buckjumping contest in ’BB, held
not in a 50ft. ring but in the open paddock, Harry
F. drew No. 9, a powerful 16.2. He did not last long.
At the 15th buck the girth and surcingle burst and
after turning a double somersault the rider was’ seen
to be 24ft. in the air astride the limb of a tree with
the saddle between his knees. George F.’s mount was
a fleabitten grey, 16 hands all over, and with an eve
like a mad cat. It was 50 to 1 on the horse No-
body gave the lightweight a chance. After a terrific
contest the rider was seen to slide to the ground with
the saddle beneath him, and, apparently, a canvas
rug also. Like a flash the grey had turned to a
blood bay, and was bleeding at every pore. It ha!
slipped its hide to get rid of George, who won.
“R.E.B”: “Pick” (B. 6/l/’2l) is not
surprising when speaking of throw-backs on fruit-
trees, as it is axiomatic that seedlings seldom produce
types true to name, and
the orange—particularly
the navel—is the most
flagrant example of _TI.
But does the average-
suburbanite know what in-
teresting experiments can
be carried out on the foun-
dation of, say, a lemon-
pip or a peach-stone? I
have on my place at Grif-
fith a six-year-old Lisbon
lemon stock producing
lemons, grape-fruit, navels
and kumquats, providing
me with citrus fruit the
year round. Similarly
with deciduous trees. I
have an almond stock on
which an Ellierta peach
has been grafted, and from
the peach one branch has
been budded to apricots,
another to plums (two
varieties, an early and a
late), and a third branch
. regularly produces heavy
crops of fine nectarines—
six varieties from one tree,
supplying me with fruit
from early December to
late February. In vinesl can
also offer you grapes suited
for brandy, poft wine, cham-
pagne or the table from
one stock, and with a little
more experiment I hope to
have all the known fruits
suited to the district on,
at the most, five trees.
“Delhi’': A simpler and more effective
manner of catching mice than that mentioned bv
“Coringa” (B. 20/I/’2l) is to tie a piece of
brown paper over the top of a kerosene-tin and
draw a knife from corner to corner, thus making
four loose flaps; then suspend a piece of bread
over the intersection of the cuts. Forty-three has
been my own limit in one night with this method,
but I have seen larger hauls.

“Ko Ko" : A chap— let’s say Bloggs—who
superintended the distribution of the Government
rations to Binghi on the W.A. goldfields, had his axe
spirited away, and shortly after its successor was also
missing; so he delivered an ultimatum—no rations
would be issued until his axe was returned/'
This was on Thursday, ration-day. Friday and
Saturday passed midst unceasing lamentation on the
part of Binghi; but the axe was not restored. Great
was Blogg’s astonishment when on rising on Sunday
morning he discovered seven axes scattered pro-
miscuously around his doorstep, none of which was
his property !

Result: one bandicoot for every grub until the
supply of bandicoots gives out.

THE FENCES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tiring the soul and fretting the senses,
Round about me the city lies.
How I long for the long, grey fences
Stretching west, ’neath the western skies.
Some as victims and some as spiders,
Men and women anigh me throng.
Give me the life of the brave, brown riders
Riding the fences, lone and long.
Out where the runs lie green and gracious,
Post and panel and wire they run.
Over the wide lands, lit and spacious,
Greyed and twisted by rain and sun.
Here they loiter by western rivers,
Dull and sluggish or swift and bright;
There where the far horizon quivers,
Lost in mirage they fade from sight.
Yon where the grey gums droop and ponder,
'Yon where the morning magpie flutes,
Side by side with the roads they wander,
Side by side with the tracks and routes.
Now on ridges and now in hollows,
On and on through the leagues they stride,
Drowned at times in the flood that swallows
Blade and bush in its tawny tide.
Now through gullies, green-walled and ferny,
Now through regions by drought struck dead,
On and on o’er the miles they journey
By hut and homestead and shearing-shed.
Oft, where the brooding mulga dense is,
Screened and hidden from human ken,
White bones lie by the long, grey fences—
Bones of cattle and lost dead men.
Yet, with longings for pathways wider,
Far from the city’s swirling throng,
Give me the life of the roving rider,
Riding the fences grey and long.

PERMANENT
Trustee Company of N.S.W. Ltd.
There are certain important points even the most astute man
may overlook when appointing a trustee. Yet these same
points may represent to his beneficiaries a saving not only of
worry and trouble, but also of money.
For instance, the Permanent Trustee Company does not make
Corpus Commission Charge till after estate becomes
distributable.
This practice—exclusive to the Permanent Trustee Company
—frequently effects a saving of income sufficient to defray
the charge.
Then, again, the Permanent Trustee Company cannot dis-
appear or die. It is, as its name attests, a PERMANENT
institution.
The estates under the Company’s control aggregate
£6,000,000, for the protection of which the whole of its
capital (£1,000,000) is liable under the Company’s Act of
Parliament. The security thus afforded makes the Company
the strongest Trustee Company in the Commonwealth.

“Jim Carew”: The N.Q. Binghi, picking
up pins from the ground with his toes (“Ewa,” B.
3/2/’2l) reminds me of one from the aboriginal
reserve at Sackville Reach, Hawkesbury River, who
under promise of a feed could occasionally be per-
suaded to pick up with his eyelids two matches
stuck in the ground. He would stand the matches
up about two inches apart, and then lower him-
self down backwards, gradually manoeuvre into posi-
tion, and then pick up the matches, one at a time.
The operation would sometimes take as long as
10 minutes.
A POINT OF LAW.
ZEALOUS JOHN HOP : “Note, then, young
feller, what yer been doin’ inside that

THE SUPECT : “Did yer see me come out?”
JOHN HOP: “No, but I sec yer go in!”
THE SUSPECT : “Then ’ow d’yer know I ain’t

“Mrs. Lance”: Has any Abo. seen the
little Queensland ant who cuts him a sail from a
leaf, and, holding it before him, sails gaily down
from the tallest tree? Used to wonder wnat all the
little round bits of leaf were till one day, while
standing under a giant gum, I was enveloped in

"Vell, vell, my dear, if it hadn’t been for Eve and der apple vere vould der clothing

a cloud of sailors coming down from above. An-
other wonder is the little black ant that stores the
grass seed for his winter supply of food. After
a heavy storm or flood he can be seen bringing up
every grain of his store, which he spreads in thie
sun, turning it when necessary, and when dry he
returns it to his underground silos. This same little
ant is a great and a fierce fighter. He enslaves his
enemies and makes them his laborers and his nurses
who look after his babies.
* * * *
“Mulga”: Why does “Sir Spen” describe
the cattle-throwing contest at Moree as the cham-
pionship of Australia? The best man I’ve seen this
side of sunset is Tom Lawton, late of Cockatoo sta-
tion, near Taroom (Q.). He easily defeated the
American cowboy crack a few years back at Too-
woomba, and recently, despite advancing years, won
a contest of this kind at Miles (Q.) from a large
number of competitors without any trouble. Yet in
the Gulf and Far-Western country I have seen
stockmen alongside of whom Lawton would appear
to be an amateur. Practically all the year round
they are doing nothing else but throwing and tying
cattle. Inside stockmen can’t be compared with
those from Outback at this class of work.
* * * *
“D.J.T.”: If what “Two Seas” (B.
20/l/’2l) says re rearing a litter of kelpies is true
we have stumbled on a great scientific discovery.
Many human infants are reared on cow’s milk, and
some on goat’s; and among human adults some
are goats and many fair cows. Clearly a case of
cause and effect. I suggest that mare’s milk be
substituted, as the horse is more intelligent than
either the goat or cow—and besides we’ll create a
new industry.
* * * *
“The Wasp”: Anent “T.E.A.’s” par. (B.
27/l/’2I). I have humped it, ridden and coached it
between Winton and Boulia (Q’land), and worked
on Warenda station, after which this mysterious
“light” he tells of, is named; his own acquaintance
with it being the tale of others. I have never seen or
heard of it. “T.E.A.” mentions that this mystery
light was frequently seen near the Uin Uin pub (on
the road), hovering in the azure, and receding as
one approached it. Um !
* * * *
“Spook”: Records? Sit up and take
this! J. Sheppherd, working seven hours 62
minutes, trenched for slab fence (six inches deep
and spade width) a total length of 50 chains. Soil
—fairly stiff loam! I know, because I paid the
cheque, plus £l. N.B. —The extra quid was not a
bonus; it was a bet.
“Fresno”: “45” asks for an economical
and effective dam on a creek loft, wide (B. 6/l/’2l).
Pick a spot where a big tree can be felled across
creek as top log. Dig a trench down to bedrock or
solid clay from bank to bank, parallel with front
edge of top log, after having made a temporary
. fluming to carry creek water so that trench can be
dug expeditiously. Cut a bottom log of required
length, and drop it into trench. Fall a good split-
ting tree and back or quarter wide slabs to reach
from bedrock to top log, and spike these into posi-
tion, overlapping the edges. Calk joints with teased
bark. A very small quantity of loam or clay will be re-
quired in front to make a water-tight job. By-wash
should be wide and shallow, carried well past back
of dam. A flood-gate should be built in centre
with about 12 feet of fluming out from back of
dam. This gate can be lifted with lever, the ful-
crum being an upright at side of flood-gate. The
gate will keep dam scoured, and is handy if an
excessive flood comes down. If flood-gate leaks,
loam containing grass roots dropped in will soon
calk same. Flood-gate and sides should be made of
sawn timber. Important: Slabs must bottom on bed-
rock, or be well into solid clay.
* * * *
“Q.P.”: On strips of uninhabited Maori-
land, known chiefly by notice on the map, Govern-
ments have done much towards developing deer
preserves. Three rare species are among the imported
animals. The wapiti, an American elk, is thriving
well. Originally U.S. President Roosevelt shipped
10 of them to M.L. in 1905, and they were
released on George Sound. The 10 have multi-
plied half a dozen times. The imported moose are
on the wild, rough stretches of Dusky Sound, and
these large deer have acclimatised well. Some won-
derful delicate-colored chamois have their domicile
on wind-swept, snow-clad Mt. Cook, where nearly
every other animal would perish in a winter. They
started with a gift from old Emperor Francis Joseph
to the M.L. Government.
* * * *
“G.S.W.”: Re “Jim Kennedy” and “En
Zed” shooting 35 ducks and 36 starlings respectively
with one shot each (B. 2/12/’2O and 13/1/’2l), I
can vouch for 114 starlings with one shot from each
of two single-barrelled guns fired simultaneously.
The boys who handled the guns were Charlie Thomp-
son, of Boggabri (N.S.W.), and Mick Morris, of
Ourimbah; and the place was near G. J.S.’s sawmill
in Kerringle Scrub. It was a showery afternoon, and
the starlings were all hanging under a huge limb
of a tree. The shots were fired from straight under-
neath, at a distance of about 50 feet. One hundred
and two birds dropped right under the tree, and
the other dozen were picked up from about 20 to 40
yards away. This happened in the autumn of 1910 ;
and either of the boys mentioned will vouch for the
shooting.
“Bullah Delah” : “Biologist” (B. 30/12/ ,£ >ol
mixes fact and fiction. Hair and nails don’t grow
after death of the body. Growth of both these
depends on cell division and modification. Cell
division can only take place so long as the dividing
cells are properly nourished. When the body dies
the heart ceases beating, and nourishment—fresh
blood—is no longer conveyed to the fingers or scalp.
Then, too, in the mammals, cell division and indeed
practically every body function depend on the
maintenance of normal body heat, and after death
the body rapidly cools. Again, it is not the
garden-woim that is capable of growing new fore
and hindei halves when bisected, but one much more
simply constructed—not a round, but a flat worm.
J. H. King, overseer of Saltern' Creek
station, puts it straight:—
“The Baron” (B. 13/1/’2l) refers to arsenical
poisoning on this station while crutching The
trouble did not occur from that work, but through
the carelessness of the man who mixed the dip. The
receptacle that held the drinking-water was just to
leeward, and as he was shaking the powder from the
packets the wind blew some of it into the water,
and those who drank this water suffered accordingly.
Some got over it in 12 hours, but nobody was sick
for more than 24 hours. During shearing there was
not a single instance of ppisoning from shearing
recently sprayed sheep.
* * * *
“Or'ney” : Passing through a soldiers’ settle-
ment the other day, saw a big, soft-faced Pommy
making for a creek with a hatful of chickens, fol-
lowed by a wildly-agitated hen. When I asked him
what he was going to do, he jerked a thumb towards
the frantic mother, and said: “Poar devil, 1 give her
too many eggs, to ,sit on! Eleven is too many to
expect one small hen to rear, so I’m drowning five
of ’er chickings for ’er.”

“Dean”: Can any Abo. tell me why dogs
always roll on dead things? I have seen them
repeatedly, on finding the corpse of a bird or animal,
roll over and ov< r it as though they were having
the time of their lives —and the more smellful the
corpse the greater the enjoyment.
* * * *
“Murkah” holds forth on a feathered won- 1
der:—
Though it is true that the albatross (“Zanthus,”
B. 20/l/’2l), the greatest of all ocean-birds, sup-
ports himself in the air for long periods, ii is not,
in the strict sense of the word, flying. Flying implies
beating the wing's. The long aeroplane-propeller
wing of the albatross was not designed to flap, but
for soaring, the real power being supplied by the
wind. When a calm compels the albatross following
a steamer to work his passage by sheer flying he
cuts a poor, even ludicrous, figure. Normal condi-
tions for this ocean wanderer are sweeping gales—,
direction no object. It is one of the finest sights
to watch one in heavy weather. With never a
move of the outstretched pinion, he calmly sails
into the eye of the gale; then, banking, one wing
sensing' the wave, he goes sailing on moveless wings
across the hills and dales of tumbling water. Flat-
tening out, he slides gracefully up the gale a
hundred feet high; then down again and out of
sight in a valley. All the time his telescope-eye is
watching for scraps flung over the side. Nothing
too small and nothing too great for his pick-axe
beak to rend. Incidentally, the albatross’s perform-
ance in sailing straight into the eye of the storm
without apparent effort is a complete mystery. His
daily mileage has been estimated at 1500. But on
one occasion I saw the endurance of even the alba-

well that in 40 seconds at the furthest they would
have to exert their full strength to get up into the
air to avoid being engulfed by the next white-topped
roller. Hour after hour they thus hurdled across
the waves. That evening the wind fell, and some
very weary sea-birds got a rest.
SQUATTER JONES’S ICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some dull acquaintance sent to Ben,
For favors he’d received of him,
A great ice-chest. This at the Glen
Where burning summer, gaunt and grim,
Had spread the land with wool and bones,
And where the glass stood, day by day,
At one, nought, seven, and to Jones
It seemed the thing was there to stay.
A pamphlet of directions went
With Ben’s ice-chest, and in a trice
He up to Sydney city sent
For half a ton of dinkum ice.
Came information that the stuff
Was forwarded, and Benjamin
In due course yoked his neddies rough,
And to the siding journeyed in.
At Blister siding is a plank
That passes for a platform. There
A kennel is, an empty tank,
A porter with a vacant stare.
The porter, with the empty eye—
A wretched wight quite free of vice—
Heaved up his frame, and breathed a sigh,
And, said he: “I ain’t seen no ice!”
He found of kerosene a case,
Two perished chickens in a crate.
He wrinkled up his hopeless face,
,“And is it perishable freight,
This ice?” said he. Then in a lot
Of dripping sacks, on seeking twice,
He found a fragment, just a spot—
But this was Squatter Jones’s ice!
Jones raved. His language was not nice.
“You cow,” he said. “What have you done
With that consignment of fresh ice?
Great snakes, I ordered harfer ton! ”
The porter swore his innocence.
Jones drove away, consumed with hate.
That night with eloquence immense
He wrote the Premier of the State.
He wrote the fat Commissioner,
‘ To station-masters here and there,
And to a dozen guards who were
Employed en route. “There ain’t, I swear,
On earth such rogues as you,” he said.
“You’d steal the gold tooth in a trice
From out a poor bush parson’s head.
You rotten rogues, gimme me ice!”
Now this was five good years ago,
But still the squatter Jones complains
About dishonest swine who go
To pinch the goods from off our trains,
And every month or so he sends
A letter couched in terms precise,
The which invariably ends:
“Embezzling swine, gimme me ice!”

WADE
the Original
One-Man Drag-Saw.
The success of the WADE in the great north-western
forests of America has been duplicated since it was
introduced to Australia.
All over this great continent it is now being utilised
by men on the land, who find it an invaluable help
—a saver of time and drudgery.
It works just as well on the largest as on the smallest
log. It can be operated on the most broken
ground or in corners. Its single wheel has a simple
wheel lock that gives rigid support.
So evenly is the weight of the WADE distributed
that one man can manage it with ease.
It has a sturdy 4-horsepower motor that can be
utilised in mafiy other ways when the WADE is
not in use.
Let us send YOU full particulars and show you
why the WADE means easier and better times for
you.

career in the Northern Army, and it was in
the Civil War that he found most of the
material for the short stories that have
earned him a certain limited fame compar-
able with that of James Thomson in poetry.
For him war had no glamor. He saw only
the horror and desolation of it all, and hav-
ing genius as well as a sense of what Pater
called the responsibility of the artist his
materials, he painted what he saw with the
power of a more restrained Zola and a
.chiselled beauty of style worthy of De
Maupassant or Flaubert. In almost every
story in the first collection there occurs a
sudden death, always with a curious twist
not unlike that which O. Ilenry introduced
in a very different genre. “An Occurrence
at Owl Creek Bridge,” for instance, is one
of the strangest things in all fiction. It
tells of a Confederate spy, Peyton Farquhar,
who is captured and condemned to death.
They take him out on a bridge, lift a plank,
put a rope around his neck and drop him
through. He feels the rope jerk and break,
feels also the chill of the water, and realises
that he has a thousand-to-one chance of
escape. Dodging bullets, he swims down-
stream and reaches a bend in the river and
safety. Travelling all day through the
woods, he arrives at his home, sees his wife
at the door, and springs forward to greet
her. Then you come on this :
As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning
blow upon the back of the neck, a blinding white
light blazes aH about him with a sound like the
shock of a cannon—then all is darkness and silence.
Peyton Farquhar.was dead; his body, with a broken
neck, swung gently from side' to side beneath the
timbers of Owl Creek Bridge,
You realise then that the whole thing is a
psychological tour de force: the rope did not
break,, and the escape takes place only in
the mind of the condemned man in the frac-
tion of a second between his fall and end.
“A Horseman in the Sky,” “One Of the
Missing” and “The Man and the Snake”
stagger you in the. same way 1 by a dramatic
surprise revealed in the last few lines by
this juggler with sudden death.
Not even Poe has surpassed the sense of
haunting terror which broods over some of
these tales. Bierce has the same mastery
over the horrible (though not over the
arabesque.) without Poe’s occasional lapses
into wordiness and fustian. It may be true,
as one critic has said, that he “writes for
effect, for startling climax, fpr an insidious
attack upon his reader’s nerves.” But the
point is that he achieves his effect: the
startling climax never fails, your nerves
always jump at his command —an infallible
proof of great literary achievement. “In
the Midst of Life” and “Can Such Things
Be?” are not the stuff that appeals to the
patrons of the circulating libraries, but if
a piercing imagination, a style that is flaw-
less in its precision and a complete com-
mand of technique count for anything, then
Bierce is in his own field one of the greatest
short-story writers that the world has yet
seen. His field may not be as wide as that'
of De Maupassant or Balzac or Kipling;
but even if your kingdom be narrow it is
something to be supreme.
G. C. DIXON.
Mary Mitford
One could swear that “Our Village” could
have been written only in tranquillity, in
the peace of some small house in the village
—a small house care-free and safe. The
little pictures, at once smooth and vivacious,
exact in detail and of a wizard-truth ol
atmosphere, smack of the comfortable chair
and desk in the good light, of serenity broken
only by serene meals and sleep, and ot a good
long time for polishing to your fitter satis-
faction. It is the work the writer would'
look iorward to when the journalist’s weekly
scramble for the butcher and baker was over
—work to be done in peace when some
lucky sale has lifted him for a month or so
over the turmoil of his hourly needs; a far,
swg£t place dim in a grey-haired to-morrow.
The stir and calm of the country-side—to
get it truly upon paper, its spirit and its
thousand bright details, its sleep and its
fertility, its loneliness and gay multitudes of
companies. It has been done, I know;
Goldsmith, Gray, Lytton, Jeffries, Thomas
Tlardv, Hewlett —these have done it well.
But there is always something more to be
said. I suppose every writing-man thinks
that if he could see the safe end of a month
he could add the last illuminating word to
some subject; but perhaps in the weekly
hurry he gets as near it as he ever will.
Mary Mitford never had any time or com-
fort or’ unanxious view of even the day after
to-morrow. Edmund Gosse quotes from one
of her letters that during all the time of her
authorship “fear and anxiety had never been
absent” from her home. So the perfect
pastorals collected under the title “Our
Village” were written with one eye on the
gate and both ears listening for the door-bell.
It was very unhappy for Miss Mitford, but it
might have been worse —there might have
been no writing done. As it was, there was
no hope for it. The pen had to go. driving
along the paper until each word ran into the
next, and the fagged brain revolted from the
joy of creation in a stupor of fatigue. She
was nearly 60 when the cause of all this
died ; so the far-off morrow was white-haired
for her, and too weary to count its precious
moments of peace.
She was born in 1787, the only daughter
of a Vagabond, spendthrift father and an un-
happy woman whom he had married for the
sole reason of her large fortune. Hr. Mit-
ford had no practice —hadn’t an hour’s work
to his credit at the end of his disastrously
long life; he wanted only the gambling
hazard and his personal comfort, and he
didn’t care how he got them. In the be-
ginning his unhappy wife put up the money ;
in the middle, when Mrs. Mitford’s contribu-
tion was gone, the nine-year-old Mary won
£20,000 in a lottery and “lent” it to him,
just saving him from a debtor’s prison; in
the end, when that too was gone, the 25-
year-old Mary settled down to writing hard
for him, watching the gate and listening for
the bell. In 1838 he had dragged things down
to starvation-point, and she got a civil-list
pension which he pocketed, she going on
writing and listening. At last he died, to
her tragic grief and dismay. Her fervent love
of him and her strong friendship with
Elizabeth Barrett seem to have been tA only
personal things in her life. She st"d be-
tween her father and the wreckage he had
made of their existence, striving ceaselessly
to keep him in peace of mind and body. From
wealth he drove them to a small house and
the need of care in finance, and from that to
beggary and a laborer’s cottage in Our
Village. He was utterly worthless, a cadger
who gave nothing and stole every hour of his
daughter’s youth and middle-age, stripping
her of everything ‘ save the writing that fed
him and put a narrow roof over him. So
when he died her heart was broken for the
loss of him, and in 1855 she followed.
She started writing as a pastime when she
was 15 ; before she was 20 she had published
three small volumes of poetry. These were
jumped on so heavily by the reviewers that
she revised her view of “poetry,” submitting
popular verse and prose sketches and tales
instead. Fortunately most of this was
accepted ; so when the need came for serious
earning she already had a reputation. She
did a good deal of the egregious editing and
compiling of those days, somehow making
both ends meet. In an inspired moment she
conceived the idea of writing plays as a
money-making proposition and turned~-out
half-a-dozen tragedies in blank verse, all
moderately successful, and one, “Rienzi.”
making a popular hit. The hit wasn’t any
use, of course; the more father got the
more he' threw away. At the end of a good
week things were just as firmly in statu
quo ante as they were at the beginning or
end of three bad ones.
Before the end of the plays-intorim she
had written a few small papers of bucolic
life and color, and had submitted them to,
the magazines. These came back with the
1830 equivalent of the familiar “R” on them.
Although Miss Mitford had by now a large
public, the editors knew better' than to
publish these simple records of duck-ponds
and winding lanes, laughing and weeping
children, wet days and dry, lambs and geese
and trees. The matter was too drastically
new and lifelike in style; besides, every
reader knew all about these unromantic,
everyday things of a country village—he
didn’t want to read them in his literature.
So the 19th century pastorals of English
letters went the rounds, making port at last
in the London Magazine, where they be-
came at once' the popular feature. For 13 •
years the buoyant chapters paid the butcher
and the baker before they were colleqted in
the five volumes of “Our Village.”
Numbers of people have followed Miss
Mitford in the path she found by favor of
her scandalous father’s needs; but they don’t
last as well. Modern as some of them are,
their work is much more patently dated than
the 1830 “Our Village.” Here surely is the
spirit of the small countryside community
set down on paper in vivid words, in happy,
passionate love of the charm of its age and
its abiding youth.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
A Satchel of Books
The Uses of Diversity, a book of essays, by G. li.
Chesterton (Methuen, London). “I do not like seri-
ousness. I think it is irreligious.” These are the
opening words of the volume, and they form some
Sort of text for the whole. Chesterton is not serious
except in short breaks; but there is real wisdom and
deep philosophy under the surface of play and banter.
He is a long-distance man, with an infinite good-
nature and a wholesome outlook, whose work shows
no falling-off in the years. Both in prose and verse
he is still fresh and young; and of all the men
writing to-day he is the most likely to surprise the
world with something really big. There is much
variety in this volume. The author glides easily
from “Lamp-posts” to “On Pigs as Pets,” and back
again to a consideration of himself in relation to,
Bernard Shaw. Nowhere is there a dull page; Ches-
terton can be joyously foolish, bpt lie never fails to
entertain.
Crucifiers and Crucified, by Theodore Price. The
curious story ‘of a conscientious objector who would
not serve in the British Army because Christ had not
directly told him to do so. lie explained to'the
authorities that he was too busily engaged in battling
against sexual vice, including married prostitution,
to take on anything more. He was given a chance
to do any sort of national work, but refused. His
crucifixion consisted of a self-inflicted starve of 11
days, relieved at last by a bottle of champagne.
The record of official laxity in the case of Price
,is toned up by much quotation of Scripture. lie was
let down very lightly.
Mare Nostrum, by Blaseo lbaflez (Constable and
Co., London). A yarn of the late war in the
Mediterranean by the author of Sonnica and the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,, honest enough
in its characterisation of the Spanish types he
knows, but padded with dreary mythological analo-
gies, and lowered by its plot to the level of Ameri-
can movie fiction. Probably Ibanez, in creating a
gorgeous German enchantress wlufee insanitary
amorousness captures a Spanish sea-captain and
lures him to supply Hun submarines with oil, was
writing with a keen commercial eye on the films.
An Old Tasmanian Road and other verses, by C. C.
Dugan (Propsting and Morris. Hobart). A little
book of good but not inspired verse, which should
have a welcome from a wide circle of readers. Try
a few stanzas of the title poem :
It comes from days of agony and shame,
This old Tasmanian road,
When men the souls of other men might tame
With stinging lash and goad.
I see them at their task, those convicts grey ;
I hear a clanking chain
That fetters man to man along the way
Of toil and biting pain.
And all the town is held by quietness;
No more the lash and goad
Drive broken men with aching feet to press
This old Tasmanian road.
So Time, the craftsman, weaves a mingled tale
Along the changing years;
The old dark ways of shame in beauty fail,
Flowers bloom o’er olden tears.
All the book is sincere, simple and. direct in its
appeal. Dugan’s verse may go further than much
that is more pretentious.

“No. 3”: They have found another use for
Australian willow. Arriving back minus a
leg, I was fitted with a Yankee artificial and
had to discard it. My seco’nd leg, made
of Australian willow, is a masterpiece—
light, beautifully-grained and solid. It will
always do me.

“F.C.” : For my sins I have to dwell in
Nunawading (Vie.), which is dry—pain-
fully dry these hot days. Lately I col-
lided with my favorite bottle-oh, in a new
rigout and a general air of prosperity.
“Hullo, Bill! Writ’s the game now, bags
or marining?” “Same old game.” “Why,
I thought we were dry now.” “That’s just
it. Where I used to get half-a-dozen bottles
before I get a score now; and places that
didn’t use tQ be worth calling at now pass
out a dozen a week. If half Mel-
bourne had gone dry I’d be runnin’ me own
car by this time. Greenwood? He’s the
best friend me and the breweries ever had.
They ought to give him a testimonial.”
“Broker”: India and Ceylon, having
bought extensively of local wines and spirits
since 1915, have also learnt to relish Aus-
tralian lager, and proclaim it equal to the
best German pilsener of 1914. The fame of
it has spread, and Australian brewers are
mopping up an increasing portion of the
trade that a Japanese decoction held in-
securely in Java and the Straits Settlements.
Particular attention is to be paid during
1921 to Java, a neighbor with a large and
sponge-like population almost the size of
France. Travellers from the south go ashore
at Batavia and Sourabaya with excellent
accounts of the foaming Australian article,
and the indigenous thirst does the rest.

“Margot!’: Re “F.C.’s” par. on the glut of
stone fruit in Victoria (B. 10/'2/’2l). Con-
sider our experience, and our place is within
20 miles of Sydney. Having a good crop of
stone fruit, and being tired of Sydney
methods, we tried to sell it cheaply and
quickly in the local town where the orchard-
ists go to buy their boots, clothes, har-
ness, fodder and so forth. We were told
we would have to get the consent of the
Mayor and Council. Mr. Mayor said he
would put the matter before the councillors.
The latter declared against the proposal
“because the shopkeepers had rates and rents
to pay.” But besides the shopkeepers there
are about 30,000 residents in that town, and
the majority cannot pay the prices demanded
by the shopkeepers, so they go without the
fruit they urgently need. That does the
shopkeeper little good, and the fruit rots
in the orchards, which does the orchardist
no good at all. It comes to this, that hun-
dreds of orchardists are debarred from sell-
ing good fruit to thousands of people in
the interests of a handful of shopkeepers, or,
rather, in the interests of the landlords who
own the fruit-shops. And that is no good
to Australia.
“Koomah”: Westralia is making tardy
use of timbers many thousand tons of which
used to be burnt as worthless. Large ship-
ments of karri scantling are now being sent
all over the world, and a mill at Welling-
ton is cutting banksia boards, which sell
readily at fl 10s. per load. The bird’s-eye
appearance of banksia—hitherto used as fire-
wood —has a beautiful effect in furniture.
Incidentally, a Digger factory at Bunbury is
turning out very serviceable handles of tuart,
yate and W.A. red-gum. This last is really a
white timber, and is as tough as whalebone,
but owing to the prevalence of gum streaks
■ —whence the name—it is hard to get large
pieces free from blemish.

“8.1. D.”: John Chinaman hasn’t that
foolish prejudice against Australian-made
goods which still possesses some Austra-
lians. In a big Sydney softgoods shop the
other day I noticed John examining a roll
of Australian flannel, which he bought. “He
will buy blankets now,” whispered the assist-
ant, and so he did. Local Chinese purchase
a lot of Australian woollens and send them
fyome to China, either as presents or as a
matter of business. They are not bad
judges of quality either.

“Jack Beer”: Mysterious are the ways of
those who have the fixing of telegraphic
rates. At present you can send a radio
from Nauru (*way over the Central Pacific
and 2000 miles from the nearest coast sta-
tion) to Melbourne or Sydney for fourpence
a word. By the time this wire has got to
its destination it has done just on 4000
miles. But it costs the same fourpence a
word to communicate between Melbourne
and Rabaul, 1000 miles nearer than Nauru,
and though Kaewieng, New Ireland, is only
a couple of hundred miles from Rabaul, the
rate is fivepenee. There is neither rhyme
nor reason in this stupid business.

And their eggs from a Sinn Fein hen;
And the battle that made a passing breeze
Is left for history’s pen.
It has not written its lesson deep
Where the crowds pass to and fro
That the harvests nations mostly reap
Are the fruit of the fields they sow.
Though ,a terrier yelp in every street
And aKpoodle on every stair;
Though the horse that runs for the cup be fleet
And the rose in the garden fair,
Not thus shall a nation’s path be free '
When the balance of destiny leans —
Old Sparta fought at Thermopylae
On home-grown onions and beans.
Get down to the simple facts that count —
Australia, hear this well!
The highest score and the winning mount
Are not the things that tell.
There is graft to do; and for all the noise,
It is fairly time to choose
Between moving on and the jimcrack toys
That work on a string for Hughes.

Carelessness about one’s personal condi-
tion is the cause of much of the distress
and the source of a large part of the
serious complaints which to-day contribute to ill-health.
Constipation is at the bottom of nine-tenths of all the ail-
ments from which we suffer, and is more the result of care-
lessness and laziness than from any other cause.
To maintain a healthy system the bowels should operate at
least once every 24 hours. This is one of Nature’s wise
provisions which is too often ignored, and the result is untold
suffering. Women and children are the greatest offenders,
but why such should be the case is a problem to be solved.
♦ i
Nature often requires a little assistance, and if this assistance
is given at the first indication much distress and suffering
may be averted. Mothers, especially, should guard the
health of their children, and inculcate regular habits.
There is within the reach of all a splendid remedy in Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, sold at a reasonable price. They will keep the system in perfect
working order and will prevent many of the serious and costly illnesses if
taken when the first signs of Constipation appear. With Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pilis at hand, and using a little care and intelligence,
the system can be kept in a sound and healthy condition.

S.S.
One of Adelaide’s very oldest law partner-
ships is breaking up, at a time when either
or both of the partners might have been
thinking rather of retirement. Wadey has been
in practice for half a century, and with E. J.
Cox for 40 years, during most of which they
have dbne all the City Corporation’s law
work. Wadey now takes in two much
younger partners, Norman and Waterhouse,
and Cox is joined by his son.
In 1918-19 Australia bought so much from
the United States and the U.S. bought so
little in return that this country had to dig
out £18,000,000 of gold to settle the differ-
ence. Last year it had to dig out only
£12,000,000, but as Uncle Sam proposes to
put a thundering duty on our wool, things
will probably become worse again. This
covin try wastes money on keeping an absurd
trade commissioner at Washington, but it
would really pay to prohibit commerce with
the Republic , altogether. The way Uncle
tra’des is more than a poor country like this
can afford.
The late Harry Wollaston advanced
steadily in the old Vic. Customs Department
but when midway in the thirties he felt un-
comfortable about his position. So many
public servants were being sacked on the
score of economy that lie determined to have
something to fall back upon if evil days came,
and he began to read up law. lie went to
the Melbourne University, got the degree of
Bachelor of Laws and was called at 39. The
resolute Westralian rose to be a full-blown
Doctor of Laws but never had occasion to
look for briefs. In early manhood Wollaston
was a fine oarsman and won races on the
Yarra.
“F.R.S.”: Old Jones was one of those coun-
try J’s.P. who constantly sat with the P.M. —
had been doing it, in fact, for about a quarter
of a century—so when at last the expert
failed to turn up, the sergeant in charge of
the ease thought his understudy had had
experience enough to handle it. Evidence
was proceeded with, and at the conclusion
Jones, J.P., addressing the prisoner, who
was undefended, said: “Young man, I could
sentence you •to six months’ imprisonment
for this offence; but there is a doubt in the
case, and I have decided to give you the
benefit of the doubt, as the Law allows me.
Fined £5 or a month.”
Adelaide City Council has decided that
this is no time to tackle the widening of the
City Bridge—the most-used road across the
Torrens. It is a perfectly good bridge, ex-
cept that the wide road narrows into it.
For most occasions it is sufficient, but when
the oval immediately adjoining empties out
a dense crowd on to it there is something
like danger. All vehicles are now made to
leave the oval by a back gate and another
road, and no notable accident has happened
yet. The Council finds that to add the sug-
gested 38 feet on each side —making a total
width of 132 feet, like the rest of the road —
would cost £32,000, and thinks the Time ;
is not Ripe. Another idea now being nibbled-!
at is to make a second pnd lower Torrens
Lake by throwing another dam across be-
tween the high banks somewhere down by
the Hindmarsh bridge, thus backing the
water up to the existing one.
“Lex’s” idea of it:—
The firms charged with profiteering in Australia
are putting up a defence which is as sound in the
opinion of many retailers as to the purchaser it
appears offensively impudent. They claim that in
cases where, say, women’s blouses only carry a
five per cent, profit, or are sold at a loss, men’s
boots may legitimately earn 50 or 100 per cent.
When Salmon and Gluckstein began to swallow the
tobacco-retailing business in England 20-odd years
ago they acted on this principle. That is to say,
they sold shag at a loss in Stepney, “gaspers”
below cost in Fulham, and Egyptian cigarettes for
three or four shillings a hundred in the wealthier
quarters. This quickly killed the small men, and
as each establishment gave up the ghost Salmon and
•Gluckstein put up their prices. Every retailer in
the country agreed that it was good and legitimate
business, except the victims. In the West End of
London and in the big country towns —and more
especially the University ones —a huge credit busi-
ness is done. Few pay cash, and hundreds never
pay at all, or have any intention of doing so. It has
been disclosed in evidence before the Courts —Bank-
ruptcy and otherwise —over and over again, that
where an article goes astray it is added to the
account of every possible consumer on the firm’s
books. A few write and challenge the claim. They
get an apology by return of post. The rest pay,
barring, of course, the considerable proportion who
practically never pay for anything until an order in
insolvency transforms their methods of economy info
an indictable'■offence. The defence of the retailers
to this custom of the trade is that they suffer huge
losses through the dishonesty of others 'and that the
deficit has to be made up somehow, and that, any-
how, people ought to check their bills. To this, and
to the other well-known justification of high prices
in credit areas —namely, that the payers have to
make up for the non-payers—the average honest
buyer returns a snort of indignation. IV hen he has
finished shorting he pays. The stream of trade is
too vast and fast for him, or for any Profiteering
Act either. Such measures may divert a fewv
monetary drops here and there, but dam the majestic
main flow of the profit-system they never will.

No wine experts are readier than those of
our valiant Ally France to admit that Aus-
tralia produces wines equal to the finest
French vintages; in fact experience has
proved that the Australian soil—particularly
that of the famous Great Western vineyard
—is eminently suited for the growth of high-
class wines, and this, with the glorious Australian climate,
combines to produce a grape that is second to none in the
world for its quality and lusciousness.
The immense cellars at Great Western are the largest and
best-equipped in the Commonwealth, whilst the laboratories
are complete with the most modern appliances connected
with the industry.
“Great Western” Sparkling Wines have been
Awarded Medals and Certificates
throughout Australia and at Phila-
delphia, Paris, Bordeaux, Amsterdam,
and other Exhibitions of the World.
“Great Western” Sparkling Wines are
Obtainable a t All Hotels and
Licensed Grocers .
Great Western Sparkling Hock.
This Wine is somewhat of the same character as Burgundy, but its
flavor is more piquant and delicate, with just a suggestion of acidulous
freshness, associated with marked softness and limpidity.
Sparkling Burgundy—Red Label.
This is a rich robust wine, possessing fulness, softness, homogeneity
and verve; makes an excellent dinner wine, and is an undoubted aid
in the treatment of those cases of physical weakness resulting
from malnutrition.
Great Western Champagne, Extra Dry,
"Special Reserve.”
A very fine and most excellent vintage with all the qualities of
roundness, lightness, body, vinosity and delicacy which are so
essential in any good champagne. It has carried off with unfailing
regularity the chief awards at the principal Commonwealth Shows.

“Save Money—Turn Friction into Power.*’
SOME ADVANTAGES OF
SKF BALL BEARINGS
FOR LINE SHAFTING:
1. The starting friction is no greater than the running friction t
hence a far smaller motor is required to produce the same driving
result, as it is unnecessary to provide for heavier starting loa.s.
2. The loss of power by friction is reduced approximately 60%
if plain bearings are exchanged to £sKF* Ba 1 Bearings.
3. Considerable saving in oil and in time, labor, and expense of
inspection and up-keep; SKF Be-rings only require attention
when oiled —three or four times a year.
4. Minimise the necessity for power plant extensions.
5. SKF Bearings, thanks to their self-aligning quality, auto-
matically and instantly adjust themselves to compensate for shaft
deflection without in any way cramping the balls,

SPORTING NOTIONS.
An attempt has been made to assess the
relative form of amateur and pro. in English golf.
In a big foursomes competition, with all the best
players engaged, the amateurs all received a concession
of two holes. It was not nearly enough, and the
current idea is that three might bring them
together.
* * * *
The English professional Ray having won
the open golf championship of the U.S.A., that
country is getting together a big fund to send over
at least a dozen of its best men to capture the Eng-
lish championship. A lot of amateurs always cross on
the same errand, and the amateur championship of
Britain was won by an American in 1904, though
the open one never has been. A suggestion is now-
made that opportunity should be taken of the
forthcoming invasion to start a golf parallel to the
Davis Cup.
* # # #
“Wart” : The efforts of the naval authori-
ties to get members of rowing clubs to join the Volun-
teer Naval Reserve are understandable, but they need
supplementing. The whole of the Naval Cadet Corps,
Reserves and the Navy itself could be made twice
as popular if the authorities issued a number of
standardised light boats so that wherever two or
three ships met they could have a regatta, and when-
ever they arrived at a shore station they could
challenge the best local crew. In such circum-
stances there should be as much interest in the meet-
ing of two champion crews as there now is in the
inter-State rowing events.
* * * *
“Dido”: Colt’s holidays came on early this
year, and he went to Red Timber, being assured that
Red Timber offered everything he craved —rest,
change, sylvan solitudes, good shooting and plenty of
fishing. The last inducement prevailed, Colt being
a whale for fishing. It was quite true; never in his
life had Colt had so much fishing for so little fish.
Then on Sunday morning he was sitting on a log,
fishing a shady pool, when a stranger chanced along.
He paused to look at Colt. Then he spoke up.
“ ’Tain’t no good your flshin’ in this crick, mister,”
he said. “Bill Howell caught it more’n two years
ago.”
* * * #
The professional Soccer clubs, which pretty
well control the game in England, have made the
calm suggestion that the English Cup should be con-
fined to them, to save the trouble of dealing with the
myriad little local clubs. Under the present system,
after 16 of the best have been exempted from the
trial stages, the country is divided into districts, and
the local clubs fight it out with their neighbors.
When they are thinned down to another 16, the
whole 32 go into the hat together, and thereafter, if
Glasgow has to travel to Plymouth to play, or vice
versa, it just takes its chance. This sporting arrange-
ment (which is much as though every horse in train-
ing in Australia should as a matter of honor enter
for the Champion Stakes) is not likely to be dis-
turbed.
* * * *
America is already getting busy over the
next Davis Cup, and has allotted courts for the dis-
cussion of the preliminary ties in Newport, Pitts-
burg, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston and Philadelphia,
the final happening at Forest Hill, IJew York.
Strictly speaking, the Yanks cannot compel the
other challengers to play off the heats in the U.S.,
and it is quite likely that if Britain and France are
drawn for a tie, the pair may dec' e to fight it out
in Europe. Again, Australia, drawn against either
India or Japan, may be able to settle on a ground
suitable to both, but considering that the winner of
the competition will have to go to New York in any
case, there may be a general decision to stage the
whole disturbance in the U.S., especially as each
round will bring a bigger gate than would be obtain-
able elsewhere. In the 1914 struggle, which Aus-
tralia eventually won, this country, Britain, Ger-
many, Canada and South Africa all went to America
and played before vast crowds.

Ranji, now too fat for class-cricket,
recently paid the highest price yet recorded for an
importation to India, namely £9OOO for Western
Wave the Stewards’ Cup (Eng.) winner. He also
bought seyeral less pretentious lots. The previous
highest price for an Indian importation was £7OOO
for Dark Legend.

“0.K.”: Here is Lord Harris saying that
England might have fared better in the Test matches
had more amateurs been selected. Why? This team
has an amateur for captain and vice-captain, and
surely Lord Harris doesn’t regard AVilson as a brilliant
success! It might be more reasonably argued that a
wholly professional team would be preferable to the
mixed sort, provided that pros, of substance, like
Shaw and Shrewsbury of old, were at the head of
affairs. Time was when two rival English teams
visited Australia in the same season, and the purely
professional one was the better, on its figures. Given
a dominating personality for skipper, an all-pro-
fessional XI does well, as the Shaw-Shrewsbury
firm proved. The old nobleman’s objection to
members of a visiting team acting as newspaper
correspondents has more force in it. Brockwell,
who was here in 1893-94 with a great reputation,
probably played miles below his English form be-
cause he had the worrying job of correspondent for
home papers. And yet neither Brockwell nor any
other disappointing pro. has been a more consistent
failure than some of the bygone amateurs. Even
A. O. Jones was a hard-working failure. In fact I
can remember only one visiting non-professional,
F. R. Foster, who was an all-important factor in
the success of his side, though Stoddart’s team,
which won three out of five test matches, thanks to
five consistent batsmen and two tireless bowlers,
had a very serviceable assistant in an “emergency”
wicket-keeper, a Northumberland man of property,
who had merely come as a friend in need, paying his
own exes. That out-and-out amateur was a decent
batsman as well as keeper, and without him the
team could not have pulled through.
* * * *
“Skyrider” : Since the English cricketerß
arrived I have heard more cricketing lies than I
thought had been invented, but no one seems to have
told about Joe Darling’s great victory on the P. & O.
boat, when he took the Australians to the Cold
Country. Joe was one of the most obliging chaps I
have ever met. He hated to disappoint anyone.
There was a chess champion on board, one of the
old school, and he confided to Jack Lyons that he
was dying for a game. “Ask Mr. Darling,” said
Jack. The chessist bucked up. “Does he play?”
“Play! I should think he did play. Get hold of
him,” So the chess champion met the cricket ditto,
and tackled him on the subject. Poor Joe didn’t
know a rook from a crow, but his good nature would
not allow him to let the professor die of unemploy-
ment. After dinner that night the team was charmed
to see the two seated in the smoking-room with a
chequered board between them. Joe argued to him-
self that all he had to do was to move the pieces
the other moved, and even a chess-player will admit
that he had a chance, up to a certain point. The
old man fortunately got first move, and the opening
was easy. The knight’s move had Joe nearly beaten,
but a man who has to study a cricket field must have
brains, and the “One straight and one diagonal” was
negotiated safely. Then came a thrust that puzzled
Joseph, and he bent over the board and studied
things. “Will you reach me the matches?” he sud-
denly said. His opponent turned to obey, and
Joe whipped a worrying bishop off the board, and
shoved a pawn up one square. The professor looked
at the position. “Where is my bishop ?” he asked.
“Oh, I took that!” replied the Australian. The old
man was flummoxed, but he said nothing and the
game went on for two more moves. Then Joe was
done. “I’ll trouble you for that ash-tray behind
you,” he said. Again the player turned, and this
time Joe yanked his king off. The old bird looked
alarmed. “Where’s my king ?” he inquired. “Oh,”
answered Joe, “I took that two or three moves
back.”

The Promoter of this Company is Mr. George Russell Mayers, who for more than 25
years has been successfully engaged in sugar-planting in'Cairns, North Queensland. He
was instrumental in securing the erection of the great Babinda Sugar Mill, which cost
over £300,000, and of which he was an original guarantor. As a grower he sent to
that mill over 25,000 tons of sugar-cane per annum from his plantation—the Bartle Frere
Estate —which lias paid dividends over 30 per cent, per annum. In the Queensland
Sugar Business he made his reputation as a sugar expert, and also a handsome com-
petency, which he is now investing in British East Africa.
It is intended to apply to have the shares of the company listed for quotation upon
the Stock Exchanges of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, and elsewhere.
The Company is formed to acquire, develop, plant and turn to profitable account
a most valuable tract of sugar land in British East Africa, secured by Mr. Mayers,
and, subsidiary thereto, to enter upon the manufacture of refined sugar, for that purpose
using and adding to the extensive sugar mill and tramway plant acquired by Mr.
Mayers, and now being assembled on the ground.
The Company will also treat and use to advantage the valuable by-products result-
ing from the sugar undertaking, and also generally engage in the principal and ancil-
lary objects set out in the Memorandum of Association, a copy of which is appended
to the full prospectus. __

tion in May last, and acquired by Mr. Mayers by tender for £22,000, of which the
sum of £4OOO has already been paid by Mr. Mayers, leaving a balance of £lB,OOO still
to be paid by him. The rental is only £45 per annum, and after an expendi-
ture of £50,000 upon cultivation, buildings and plant to the satisfaction of the Lands
Officer of the Territory, the lease may be converted into one of 999 years (practically
a perpetual lease) at the same annual rental. ,r, n-nAn,
THE COUNTRY 18 PRE-EMINENTLY SITUATED FOR SUGAR-GROW-
ING. AND ABOUNDS IN NATURAL FACILITIES. MR. MAYERS IS SATIS-
FIED THAT NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, EXCEPT PERHAPS JAVA IS
IN A POSITION TO GROW SUGAR SO CIIAEPLY AS IN EAST AFRICA,

CHEAPEST LABOR IN THE WORLD —FIVE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE PER
WEEK, AS AGAINST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES £4 TO £6 PER WEEK.
The concession abuts right on the RAILWAY from Mombasa to Lake v ictoria, and
is thus in direct railway communication with Ocean Ports and local distributing centres.
The first 1000. acres is now in process of being cleared and planted, THE COST
OF WHICH—ESTIMATED AT £23.000—1S TO BE BORNE BY THE VENDOR,

With “CHAMPION” Patent
Shafts and Automatic End
Gates, Steel or Wood Wheels.
This one advantage should decide you in their favor, for you know as
well as we do the trouble experienced with scoops made with joints and
rivets.
In “Champion” Earth Scoops the bowls are pressed from a single sheet
of specially-hardened steel plate—the cutting edges being most carefully
ground to ensure quicker and more satisfactory results for their users.
In addition the bails are of steel with correctly working swivels made
of high-quality steel.
The steel runners fitted on the under side of the bowls mean increased
efficiency and longer life.
You can use a “Champion” Scoop most economically in ploughed or
unploughed soil—their improved shape and sturdiness of construction
enabling them to enter the ground easily and quickly.
Fig. 539.—Showing “CHAMPION” Patent Shafts
“Champion” Patent Shafts greatly increase the
efficiency of wheel scoops.
The Shafts prevent all jar and oscillation from
coming on horses’ necks, shoulders and legs.
The horse, harnessed in the shafts, takes the weight
on its back, as in a tip-dray.
The two outside horses are practically free, and
can use their full strength to fill the scoop and
haul it. i
When desirable, two horses may be put in lead
instead of three abreast.
A Contractor’s Opinion.
G. T. ALLNUTT, Contractor, Cheltenham, writes:
“Champion” Patent Pressed Bowl Wheel Earth
Scoops, with shafts, will do almost any work better and
lighter than any scoop I know of.
The horses have much more power over their work
than with a pole.
I never saw scoop teams so free from injuries as
mine are, with “Champion” Patent Shafts.

‘‘His Lady Friends,” the new Sydney
Criterion show, is a promising Palais Royal
farce ruined by adaptation to the moral
prejudices of polite America. All the
theatre-going world knows what to expect of
a French husband who, posing as a bache-
lor, keeps three or four ladies in luxury on
the proceeds of a Bible-selling business. It
will draw the same inference, on the facts, as
a Judge in divorce. But American husbands
have to be different, for stage purposes, else
were they unworthy to be laughed with by
virtuous audiences, and too polluted to be
taken back ultimately to the bosoms of their
pure young wives. In order to cope with
these conditions we have Joseph Coyne, as
the millionaire husband anxious only to
spread a little sunshine amongst the girls
of his acquaintance, comporting himself like
one of those psychological oddities set out
in the works of Krafft-Ebing. He has never
so much as kissed anyone but hjs wife in
their seven years of married life; but over
the long-distance telephone his lady friends
embrace and bite him rapturously, and get
out of their baths and talk to him in the
altogether, and lie is entranced. Accepting
“His Lady Friends” as a farce and not a
problem play, the premise upon which it rests
is incredible, arid the fact detracts from the
interest throughout.
* * * #
Joseph Coyne plays the harassed amorist
on more or less conventional lines. lie
features a wealth of facial gesture ; express-
ing terror, delight, annoyance, bewilder-
ment so plainly that the most myopic can
interpret his changing emotions at a glance.
He keeps the action on the top gear for as
long as he is on the stage, and makes his
points like the tradesman he is. One touch
of originality will endear him to all old
farce-goers. Though the furniture is lit-
tered with cushions, he neither punches one
in anger nor throws one at another charac-
ter in jest. George Blunt is the lawyer
who undertakes to get him out of his dirti-

culties. He over-
pi ay s. I n fact,
his sustained
truculence rather
suggests a New
York detective on
third-degree duty
than a family
attorney who is
being extrava-
gantly paid for
his services. Beryl
Bryant is appro-
priately sweet as
the wronged wife,
and Rubi Treleare
gives a careful
study of one of
those vixenish and
extravagant wives
who in one class of
life drive men to
murder and in an-
other to drink and
insolvency. Mar-
jorie Bennett (a
sister of Enid) is
a fascinating little
flapper; and Lance
Lister accom-
plishes the re-
markable feat of
putting a real live
boy on the stage.

didn’t say, that
are independent of
climate and the
caprices of amal-
gamations. “T h e
Lilac Domino,” at
Sydney Tivoli, is
one of these enter-
tainments. Sydney had its 86th help-
ing last night, and continues to give all the
signs and tokens of an unsatisfied appetite.

passed in a blaze of glory at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney, the final illumination of the season

which the Firm frankly owns to be of sur-

Allan Wilkie and his company are still ex-
pounding Shakspeare at popular prices to
Opera House audiences that include bits of
i Sydney, from odd residents of
the Chinese quarter to lengthy crocodiles
from the young ladies’ seminaries. In “As
Tou Like It” Miss Hunter-Watts was the
sprightly and fascinating Rosalind and
Av ilkie the melancholy Jaques, and for
those who don’t appreciate blank verse there
was a real smart songandance turn. The
play was charmingly presented, and the act-
ing was capable all round. Like'Asche,

been the basis of many a dusty farce, but

adopts a wife for the purpose of deceiving
an old uncle owning the customary cheque-
book and credulous ear, and the business is
kept going by a flow of piffle, tinkly songs,
dress parades, and heavy clowning that grow
somewhat wearisome as the show drags to
its close. It is a poor thing to reintroduce
Dot Brunton to Melbourne audiences, yet
that charming little lady makes one forget
her surroundings to a considerable extent.
Probably London has taken some of the
honey and volume out of her voice, but her
development as an actress, displayed in tones
and graces and gestures hardly known in the
old Dorothy, puts her classes ahead of the
average humdrum star of the musical-comedy
stage. Frith, playing the bookkeeper in
Bunny Bunting’s weird furnishing depart-
ment, is mostly represented by spasms of
facial disorder, made a trifle more alarming
by a pair of goggles and a labored craving
for lemons. William Greene rushes about
without any suggestion of going anywhere,
and chatters his dialogue as if the manage-
ment had set a time limit to his conversa-
tion. Cyril Ritchard prattles with much
the same speed, but with a note of
indignation boiling somewhere about his
boots. He dances with Madge Elliott in one
of those demented mixtures of wrestling and
weight-lifting that hardly leave the male
partner strength for the final hug. Madge
has also an uncertain part, but practically
all she does is to produce a smile which her
partner’s antics imply is fearfully alluring.
Field Fisher moves into the discourse towards
the end of the first act, but his work as
Samuel Giggleswick is largely completed
in the dressing-room. A white wig and a
grease-painted blush on his face are all that
is necessary to establish Samuel’s identity.
Cecil Bradley hovers about the edge of the
proceedings. She is never fully in the lime-
light except in a couple of undistinguished
songs. Hettie Hartley is forced into the
marriage ifitrigue for low-comedy purposes,
but her somewhat fairy-like figure is against
any pronounced success in this line. Also,
Rita Nugent frisks about in a toe-dance, and
later joins Jack Hooker in an eccentric
whirl.
At Melbourne Royal the fair fingers of
Gladys Moncrieff continue to snap at old
General Stigant’s charm of manner. There

Fritz Hart’s production of “The Marriage
of Figaro,” at Melbourne King’s, has dis-
carded some previous shortcomings at Mel-
bourne Playhouse, and is now a very agree-
able .show indeed. For one thing Fred
Collier gives a lot of voice, and perhaps a
larger donation of beef than might be thought
necessary, to the big part of Count Alma-
viva ; but Fred has cultivated a professional
manner and has confidence and aplomb that
compensate for the suggestion of overweight.
Howett-Worster, who sang Figaro before,
shows hi.s old dramatic adroitness, but A dele
Crane’s Countess is still a little flinty in
parts. Gertrude Ilornal doesn’t play
to the life, but she gives a hint or
two of Susie’s vermilion personality. Cheru-
bino is again in the hands of Iris Turner,
who keeps that young devil in the centre of
the conspiracy. The rest of the cast are
a bit amateurish at times, but generally they
lose their formal aspect under the admoni-
tory baton of Fritz Hart.

Melbourne Tivoli is, for the moment, still
trembling with the announcement that “Chu
Chin Chow” and “The Lilac Domino” have
been sold to J.C.W. Also the doors of the
house that ’Arry built are closed to permit
of its finishing its tremble in peace. In
short, the run of “Chu Chin” concluded with
a rush of performances, and its 16 scenes
have gone to Adelaide, leaving the stage at
liberty to receive the J.C.W. production of
“Princess Ida” on Saturday. This revival
of a Gilbertiap opera, with which no reason-
ably young citizen of Melbourne is familiar,
will place Strella Wilson in the forefront for
two farewell weeks.

Criticism slumbers when the populace
enters Melbourne Princess’s nowanights, and
St iffy and Mo. Daisy Merritt and Abdy’s

pay-boxes. Incidentally, it is carrying the
Fullers further away from ruin with every

a friend’s shirtfront. “The Loves of Letty”
rise and languish in the Pinero fashion at
the Crystal Palace and the Empress. At

dazzling in a figurative sense. Rather a
sort of mild French grey.

The spectre of Gaby Deslys is appearing
for a week at Melbourne Majestic. As the
wife of a scoundrelly husband, she uses an
aeroplane and a vast quantity of jewellery
to save an Amurkan engineer from being
swindled. The> title is “The God of Luck.’’
Henry B. Walthall gives closeups of his sad
sad eyes in “The Long Arm'of Mannister”
on the same programme, whilst Ralph Errol
is warbling snacks from his favorite operas
at every performance. Hoyt’s, who have
been exploring Europe for new stars have
caught another Italian lady, Bina Menichelli
in “A Woman’s Story.” But a more stun-
ning girl is Betty Ililburn, whose youthful
contours receive all the advertisement thev
deserve in “The Girl of the Sea.” Hoyt’s
“Adorable Savage” is a Fiji romance, but
the Fiji landscape presented is only a short
car-run from the Universal studio in Cali-
fornia. The Britannia is whisking Sessue
Hayakawa into view in “The Devil’s Claim,”
whilst the Melba is showing Rex Beach’s
“Silver Horde?” or a very pretty picture of it.
“Sinbad,” at Adelaide Royal, is a bright
circumstance, particularly pleasing after a
summer of screen-pictures, Jennie Hartley
and Linda Young are now the pair of “prin-
cipals,” Jack Cannot and Dan Agar make
most of the fun, and William Hassan is a
great Cat. The lightly-clad characters have
the best of it, for monsoonal moist heat has
made Adelaide no place for indoor shows.
Welch, Graham and the rest of the So-and-
So Co., barring Pauline Bindley, are mak-
ing a round of the northern towns, the
Jubilee Exhibition being wanted for the
agricultural show; thus the Vogues and
Vanities at Austral Gardens have the mono-
poly for the present of out-of-door evening
shows—except that Wondergraph duplicates
its pictures under the stars on North Ter-
race. It has been showing Chambers’ “Fight-
ing Chance,” with the New York hero
battling against an inherited drink-tendency
in a fashionable setting; also, Locke’s
“Morals of Marcus,” enormously altered
from the book. The Pav. has another stage
success, “Lady Camber,” English-made and
acted. At West’s is a tremendous “Madon-
nas and Men,” ranging from Christians and
lions in ancient Rome to the striking of oil
in modern America, with the old Romans
reincarnated; a gripping and unusual pic-
ture.
The agreement which ended the latest
shipping dispute is to last till Dec. 31, “or
until otherwise determined,” which doesn’t

and oppressor, whom freeborn unionists
can’t submit to any longer. But under the
terms of settlement job-control is dropped,
the parties agree to adjust their differences

too hard, and the light went out suddenly.

“Nella” : The ornate announcements on the
movie screen as to who’s who—the scenario-
cobbler, the story-fakir, the film-director, the
architectural expert, the animal-trainer, the
leading manicurist, and so on—invariably
thrill me, and I’m always relieved to know
that Cyrus P. Heinbockel and Gwladys
Zinck Hocheimer have safely passed the
Board of Censors. But last night they
sprung a newey on me. Hannibal X. Cock-
tail was solemnly announced as the “Con-
tinuity Director.” Continuity in a ’Murkan
film? Black out!
“First Robber”: Gus Neville, who holds
the Australian storming record of juveniling
in a new bellowdrama every week for four
years, has been helping Allan Wilkie’s
Shakspearean shows along with a well-
modulated voice for more than two years,
now. The cute-looking page-boy of these
productions, the one with the Buster Brown
crop, is Dorothy Neville, Gus’s 15-year-old
daughter.
“Dido”: There is an actress in Australia
who, if you are an intimate, will explain
to you the disadvantages under which an
artist labors in making too vivid a display
of the domestic virtues —the risks she runs,
for instance, in emphasising her fondness for
children. This particular actress has no
great affection for the young of man. She
believes the babies all very well in their
place, understanding there are orphan asy-
lums- and cr6ches and places of the kind;
but in one entertain-
ment in which she
figured she' had to
handle several dear
little children, and act-
ing on orders con-
trived to squeeze a
whole lot of fondness
into her words and
actions. This had
been going on for five
weeks, when one morn-
ing the maid found a
parcel on the mat, ad-
dressed to the actress.
With the parcel went
a note which said that
the writer had ob-
served with deep emo-
tion the lady’s rare
love for children, as
displayed in the part
she was then enacting.
Presuming on that
obvious great affection
for little ones, the
writer ventured to
hope the dear and
gifted woman would
appreciate the accom-
panying present, a free
gift from a devoted admirer. The present
was a set of twins about eight days old.
• “Norbell”: Allan Wilkie threatens to
break out as Mark Antony in “Julius
Gsesar.” As Wilkie uses only the minimum
of scenery, one would suppose that a special
outlay on any one production would be
unnecessary. But the new log is a stumbling
block. For instance, when George Rignold
was Mark Antony he paid his noble Roman
supers two bob a night, and nothing at all
for rehearsals. Nowadays the non-speaking
patrician on the salary list is entitled to
7s. 6d. per casual performance, and ss. for
each rehearsal. Wilkie’s shows are “casual”
because he changes the bill every night. If
he gives 50 supers three rehearsals his bill
for also-ran actors will be about £6O for
one night. Wilkie has the heart of a hero,
and intends having a sufficiency of friends,
Romans and countrymen, and damn the
expense.
The National Theatre, Cologne, has had
the courage to revive “Hamlet.” The
British still “in occupation” found it a
quaint experience to share in the open delight
with which the house received the First
Gravedigger’s famous jest: “Marry, why was
he sent into England? Why, because he was
mad. He shall recover his wits there, or if
he do not ’tis no great matter. ’Twill not be
seen in him there; the men are as mad as he
is.”
“Pongo”: Arthur Crane, who passed out
at Brisbane last week, was a Newtown
(N.S.W.) product and a pupil of Riecardi.
His first job was that of telegraph-messenger
at Sydney G.P.0., and afterwards he became
a city postman, being known to sentimental
spinsters in the Maequarie-street boarding-
houses as “the postman with the beautiful
voice.” As an amateur he was one of the
Sydney Idlers, along with Phillip Lytton,
Madge Hope, Madge Helmrich and others,
and he migrated to the professional stage, per
medium of a vaudeville show which strug-
gled along in the old York-street Opera
House. He then went on tour with the
Pollard Opera Co., had a vaudeville season
on the Rickards circuit, and later appeared
in grand and comic opera for the Firm.
Always a steady chap Crane saved his
money, and never had occasion to send round
the hat. He had a pleasing baritone of
good range and artistic delivery, but as an
actor he never got out of the ruck. Colin
Crane, better known as Colin Campbell, is
a younger brother.
“Rienzi”: Hugh Mclntosh was alleged last
week to have been “absorbed” by the J.C.W.-
Tait combination. It doesn’t actually
amount to that yet, but as Mac is letting
the J.C.W.-Taits have the use of “Chu Chin
Chow” and “The Lilac Domino,” both money-
spinners of the most pronounced description,
and is leasing his Tivoli Theatres in three
capitals to Harry Musgrove, jun., to in-
crease the vogue of movim.-pictures, the
public may draw—and has t rawn—its own
conclusions, even though some of the finan-
eial arrangements may still await completion.
The public is an interested party, inasmuch
as Mclntosh competition undoubtedly im-
proved the quality of the theatrical fare
offering in Australia, at least of the light,
spectacular sort. But the public’s views
receive scant consideration in these momen-
tous transactions. As far as the J.C.W.-
Taits are concerned, it is not a question
of acquiring theatres. They were already
well supplied. In Melbourne they own the
freehold of Her Majesty’s and the Royal,
and for a good while at least they can
engage the King’s whenever they want it.
In Sydney they are even better off. The
re-building of the old Royal, with, the pro-
mised appearance of another show-place in
George-street, near the Town Hall, will give
them a great position, especially as they
already hold leases of the Criterion, Palace
and Her Majesty’s, the contract for the last-

mentioned expiring in three years. What
the public wants in the way of theatrical
performances is competition. What it is
going to get is another matter.
“Norbell” goes to the pictures:—
Once a week my wife tows me to the pitchers to
have my mind improved, and to be bitten of
voracious suburban fleas. The palace we affect is
constructed of galvanised iron, and envious and
impecunious small boys rattle sticks along its stark
walls from outside, whilst inside the patrons devour
super-art-million-dollar-feature-masterpieces and pea-
nuts with avidity. I derive mild amusement from
anticipating the obvious and inevitable “situations,”
and whispering to the missus what’s coming next.
They’re all built to templet, these million-dollar
reeling superfluities. First, there’s the view of the
magnificent mansion and grounds owned by the
square-jawed plutocrat. Next, the close-up of his
pensive wife, cuddling, young 'coyotes, or skunks, or
other U.S.A. fauna. For variety now and then she
is gazing rapturously at two dicky birds in a nest,
and always there is a profusion of shrubs in blossom.
Then the lady appears in ultra-masculine breeches
and boots, and goes riding off with the thin villain
with the aquiline profile. Then we have the square-
jowled husband smoking cigars in his luxurious office,
busy with the telephone and tape-machine when he
isn’t ogling the star typist. And there’s the angel
kiddy toddling downstairs in her little ’jamas, looking
for mummy. And then—but there, everyone knows
it by heart.
Last night, however, I had to sit up and take
notice, for the perdoocer had made a startling inno-
vation. When Square-jaw, the neglected wife, and
the angelic child sat down to breakfast, and the
beautifully-trained, million-dollar butler handed the
morning papers, I gasped. Instead of the regulation
movie-millionaire breakfast of grape-fruit, served in
cut glass and mounted in cracked ice, American ori-
ginality had reasserted itself—they had ordinary
toast and bacon for breakfast!
“Macquarie Street” considers the ease of
a tenor: —
Judging from recent cables, Caruso has been
critically ill since the “slight" accident which
occurred to him while singing'in “L’Elisir d’Amore”
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in December.
He has been struggling with pleurisy and a weak
heart, and during the illness was reported to be un-
conscious at times. Such complications don’t follow
upon bleeding from a wound of one of the capillaries
at the base of the tongue, which was the official ex-
planation given to the New York reporters. Dr. Philip
Horowitz, who has been Caruso’s personal physician
for five years, attributed the bleeding to an abrasion
of the mucous membrane of the back of the tongue
by some sharp substance, such as a fragment of
oyster shell. This fragment had perforated a
minute vessel, and the more the star sang the wider
became the wound in the vessel, and the more severe
the haemorrhage. This explanation was peculiar
surgically speaking, and by no means convincing
for I have never seen, or even read about, a similar
ease. A week after the occurrence, the doctor said-
“ Now, Caruso is all right again. The accident was
very slight, though at the time I did not know
what it might be. There is only one deduction to
be drawn from later reports of the stout tenor’s
health, and that is, that the haemorrhage did not
proceed from the throat at all, but arose from the
rupture of a small vessel in the lung, a far more
serious happening, and one that will have permanent
results. The later symptoms, heart weakness, and
pleurisy, could follow haemorrhage from the lung,
and it is not an uncommon thing in practice to find
haemoptysis, as this condition is termed, ushering
in pulmonary consumption. A doctor has to be ex-
tremely careful when he is consulted by a patient
who has expectorated blood. The source of the
bleeding is sometimes obscure, and the best of
physicians may come a cropper, so it is always
better to wait events before committing oneself.
Later accounts are more favorable, but if Caruso’s
complications were the result of haemorrhage from
the lung he is not likely to appear any more on the
operatic stage.
“Stargazer”: I went late in the day to
sample “Chu Chin Chow,” animated with
great expectations. With the experience I
have, I should have been prepared for dis-
illusionment. The disillusionment came all
right. “Chu Chin Chow” is a pantomime
with almost everything that makes a panto
endurable left out, and without compensating
advantages. There is not one amusing line
in all the dull wonder of it. The staging
•is good in a florid way, but not noticeably
so after O. Asche’s representation of Kismet
at the house opposite, and the boasted dress-
ing is not equal in ingeniousness of design
and choice of color to much that we have
seen at previous musical entertainments in
the’'course of the last few years, notably
“The Passing Show of 1920.” Vera Pearce
minimises her personal attractions with an
unfortunate make-up and a particularly
wicked black wig, and her part is cast in so
dolorous a strain throughout that her
aggressive mannerisms of gait and gesture
and her trick of talking like a bellman be-
come painfully oppressive before the Arabian
night’s entertainment is done. A peculiarly
idiotic trick of carrying the hands stiffly
outspread after the manner of an Egyptian
carving, an eccentricity for which there is
no excuse on earth, but which is a dramatic
convention wherever Eastern girls are turned
loose on the boards, becomes sadly irritating
after two hours of it. The old man in the
desert, seconding the dolorous heroine’s out-
cries with, his dirge of blood and gory sun-
sets and wounds and worry, is an avowed
public nuisance before his final removal is
effected. In the welter of adulation with
which this amazing London success has been
greeted, some words of mild reproof are
urgently called for. Meanwhile “Chu Chin
Chow” is wholly responsible for a local con-
viction that Arabian nights were not more

I had headed Hector back to his native hamlet.
Foolishly he did not tell me it was the home of

with the rude fathers of the place. However,
Hector was pleased with himself. He had left them a
weedy amateur; he had returned a star. “You

Ah, patient Muse, and dost thou hear?
They scoff at thy pretensions now,
And none remains to hold thee dear,
To bind the chaplet on thy brow.
Once all in all, fair dame, wert thou.
Thy fame is gone, thy throne is cleft.
They shame thee as a fruitless frau,

How scornfully they pass thee near,
Another with their gifts endow.
’Tis business whom they seek to cheer,
At her they smirk, to her they bow.
A dowry will her sire allow.
For this fat thing thou art bereft.
Cold cash is all the why and how

They wooed thee once. The profiteer
In vile pretence did make his vow,

E’en though they flirted ’neath the bough
In cheap dissimulation deft.
At last they throw thee in the slough,

NOTONLY oistilleo, but also bottled
UNDER GOVERNMENT SUPERVISIQN
Hobbs and Itliodes opened for England in
the fifth Test at Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday,
the former evidently handicapped by his leg-strain.
The 40 he made, before misjudging an extra-fast
one from Gregory, did credit to his nerve and
resolution. Rhodes pottered, but it was the game
for his side. It would be interesting to see him
batting on a winning side. Makepeace’s and Ilen-
dren’s careers were cut short early. The fielding
at this stage was very sure, and Carter, behind, and
Gregory, at fine slip, were safe as houses. Woolley
treated all the bowling alike, and was particularly
partial to the two fast bowlers and Mailey, whom
lie knocked clean off his length. The Victorian
“express” ultimately drove him back on to the
stumps while executing his favorite stroke. With
Woolley gone, all hope of a big score vanished, and
the innings closed for 204. Kelleway bowled well
(he is now at his top), and so did Mailey until
Woolley collared him. Gregory “slowed down” and
was not dangerous. After Collins, Bardsley
and Taylor had been outed for paltry scores
in Australia’s first knock, Gregory came in and
played with marvellous restraint. ilis associate,
Macartney (170) was very safe and confident, with
flashes of brilliancy. Fender’s were the best bowling
figures, and Wilson’s length was always good. Douglas
again bowled well and brought down two good birds
in Bardsley and Taylor. Woolley had to be played
but seemed slower than usual. The wicket was
not a Rhodes wicket. Parkin chopped about from
“round” to “over” the wicket, and bowled all sorts
of stuff, most of it poor. His work as a comedian
is, however, sound. The fielding generally was only
fair—at times it was very sluggish. The men
were well placed, except for Macartney: he made
repeated boundary strokes off Woolley, whose “off”
was almost bare.
* * * *
England wanted 164 to evade an innings defeat
on Monday, with Woolley and Makepeace gone.
Rhodes and Wilson faced Gregory and Mailey, the
indiscreet dominie getting nothing whatever from
the maligned “Hill.” He is a poor bat —though
the criticism he received was enough to slow down
a good one—and Carter stumped him when he had
made a dispirited five. Ilobbs followed and got
the greeting of a lifetime. The crowd has learned
to love Jack Hobbs and Rhodes and Hendren, clink-
ing good sportsmen and cricketers all, and as the
weeks pass it begins to take Douglas to its vast
bosom. But Fender never was liked, and his jour-
nalism put the lid on the matter. His reception
equalled Wilson’s. He is less temperamental than
the old Cantab, and a far finer performer, and he
put up a bright display worth 40. After he had
been banging the bowling to the pickets for five
minutes or so the fickle multitude was applauding
him warmly. Douglas compiled a resolute 68, and the
innings closed for 280. Australia hit up the re-
quisite , 68 on Tuesday for the loss of Collins’s
wicket. It is the first time in the history of the
series that one side has won all five Tests, and the
first time that so many unpleasantnesses have arisen.
The other side failed to run true to form, and the
upshot certainly doesn’t represent the respective merits
of the two teams. England had all the worst of
the luck, and at no stage does the combination
appear to have been a happy family.
Charlie Macartney’s 170 is his highest in 27 Test
innings. It has lifted his aggregate to 865, averag-
ing 33.26, placing him -next to Warwick Armstrong
(35.43) among present-day Australian players.
Arthur Mailey’s “The Australian Fifteen
for England” is to hand. The caricatures are all
good, while some—notably those of Armstrong,
Gregory and the artist himself—are priceless. There
is an appreciation by C. R. Bradish and a fore-
word by the Australian skipper, and the lot may
be acquired from Alex. McCubbin, Melbourne, for
one bob.
“Whitehall’s” view of it: The chief trouble
with Wilson and Fender is a matter of class. The
middle-class Englishman is one of the touchiest cus-
tomers imaginable. He is constantly being slighted
in his own country by members of the class just
above him, and he takes it well. All he asks is
that he shall get from his inferiors that deference
which, for his part, he gladly accords to peers or
millionaires. In India and the East generally he gets
it—or rather he has been accustomed to until lately.
That is why the British-born Indian civil servant
was such an eminent success in the past. He—the
son of a humble stockbroker or solicitor —treated the
natives with the genial yet aloof tolerance which
his local county magnate extended to him, and all
parties were happy. When previously untravelled
Englishmen, such as Wilson or Fender, first arrive
at places like Sydney or Capetown their feelings are
outraged at every turn. An intolerable ease of
manner is manifested by socially impossible persons
who in England would maintain a respectful silence
even if they didn’t touch their hats. A devastating
suspicion grows and grows. These fellows do not
recognise a gentleman when they see one. To them
a Wilson is as a Hendren, a Fender no more than
a Strudwick. They try to assert themselves. Disaster
follows. After that they either retire into their
shells with resentful mutterings about “outsiders”
and “blasted colonials” ; or, as more often happens,
they acquire the local point of view and get on well
with everybody. Men of the type of Ivo Bligh, F.
S. Jackson, Lord Harris and Lord Sheffield hit it off
with Australians from the jump, not because they
were better men than Fender or Wilson, but because
they were sure of their positions. They were so
satisfied of their impregnability in this respect that
they could afford to be familiar with the humblest,
and they were. They did not find themselves
alternately struggling to be democratic and boiling
with indignation when they were taken at their
words. The more a middle-class Englishman travels
the more he is liked in the oversea dominions —
provided he is a man at bottom. Douglas is a case
in point. He is no different from the Douglas of
old, but he sees strangers, from a truer angle. Even
the quick-witted Warner had to pass through his
period of probation. Wilson and Fender are suf-
fering acutely from that slighted feeling, and —
unconsciously perhaps—it is affecting their judgment
and jaundicing their views. Jt is a pity, in the
circumstances, that they took to the Inky Way. The
ideal Test cricket amateur-journalist for an Aus-
tralian or S’African tour would be the Prince of
Wales. Failing him some unimpeachably fashionable
member of the House of Lords. Balham, North
Hampstead and so on become peevish too readily.
The N.S.W. XI defeated Queensland by
102 runs. F. O’Keefe (72) and W. Ives (38) for
N.S.W. made light of the twirlers of S. W. Ayres
(7 for 88) in the visitors’ second hit. The North-
erners’ best batting efforts were made by L. Oxen-
ham (60), J. Sheppard (40), L. O’Connor (39) and
J. McAndrew (36 n. 0.). N.S.W. captain Jimmy
Randell (7 for 142) and W r . Ives (7 for 84) did
most damage with the ball. J. Farquhar (Q.)
stumped four and caught three.
The N. S. Wales tourists were badly downed
last week by Toowoomba (Q.). Both sides
played 12 men and while Tobwoomba piled up 152
in the first innings, N.S.W. could respond with only
72. J. McKenna did the damage to the Ma State
with 10 for 30 in 13 overs, the other casualty being
W. Wells (retired hurt). The wicket was soft; but
the Outbackers put up a great performance all the
same and one that shouldn’t miss the eye of the
State selection committee.

Having been called upon by the Railway
Department to “get out,”
as the area it leases at
Joliinent is wanted for
lepartmontal purposes, the
East Melbourne Cricket
Club, with the backing of
Donald Mackinnon, ex-
Assistant Minister for
Lands, has been trying to
mop up the Albert
Ground, St. Kilda-road,
formerly known as the
Warehousemen’s Ground.
The M.0.C., which holds
the coveted reserve in
conjunction with the
Lawn Tennis Association
of Vic., became riled and
sent a counter deputation
to Oman, Minister for
Lands. Speaker Mackey
and Mitchell, K.C., and
other heavy guns made a
noise. Oman promised
fair play, and talked
about the possibility of
placating East Mel-
bourne Club by letting it
have a lease of the land
now used by Scotch Col-
lege (between the rail-
way line and the Yarra,
in the Morgue neighbor-
hood) when the college
shifts its quarters out to
Glenferrie next year.

Fitzroy came out best in Melbourne Dis-
trict cricket on Saturday with a win over E.ssendon
by an innings and 7 runs. ’Roy took their unfinished
innings to 200, but Essendon, 130 in arrears, could
manage only 123 next time, Davies carrying out his
bat for 59, whilst only three of the others got into
double figures. McKenzie (4 for fiO) and Cannon
(4 for 40) were rseponsible for tbe wreckage. Rich-
mond beat Carlton on the first by 85. The out-
standing features of the battle were Whitehead’s five
for 37 for Richmond and the rock-like endurance of
Bartholomew of the same club, whose three in 70
minutes is probably a record. ’Wood, who had three
for 70 to their credit against Northcote last Satur-
day, needed the absent Ryder badly. Ryder’s 39 un-
finished was the best score, and with four ducks in
their tally, ’Wood were 40 short of ’Cote’s first total
of 153. Bigger figures were registered in the East v.
University engagement. The students made 254 and
East lost by 59, Dean knocking up 66 n.o. after
Mayne and McAlister had failed for two and one.
South nearly scored an innings defeat over P’ran.
After making 119, P’ran responded with 98, which
left them with 32 ahead of South’s first total of 185.
South therefore won on the first innings by 66.
Saints’, closing with seven for 268, were only 39
ahead of North at the end of the day. North made
an unexpectedly solid response.

“Ossy” Merrett is one of the few who take
a lively interest m the rising generation of athletes,
after they themselves
have ceased to be
active competitors.
The number of hono-
rary offices he holds
in amateur sport is
probably a world’s re-
cord. Not many years
ago he was one of Syd-
ney’s best Rugby
wingers, playing both
for North Sydney and
the Manly first-grade
XV’s. As a gymnast
he also shone, whilst
at open-boat sailing he
lifted many prizes in
the early days of the
old Middje Harbor
Club. A very fair
swimmer, he has been
an affiliated „ member
of the N.S.W.A.S.A.
for over 20 years.

Paul Demsky, the 17-year-old Russian from
Queensland, besides having a terrific kick in that
right hand of his. is said to have a reach longer
by than that of Jack Johnson. Jerry Sullivan
seems to have been uncertain of this until after the
first round at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night.
For three-quarters of the recognised journey the Sulli-
van jaw was worried like an old tooth. A kind-
hearted referee saved it from being knocked right
out of the ling in the 16th. The Sydney boy was
reduced to a dazed condition and unwittingly "fouled
his man in the 15th. Demsky for the first time
exhibited signs of pain, but recovering quickly
returned to the attack. When the gong sounded
Sullivan Shook a very loose jaw as he staggered to
his corner, and Joe Wallis realised that another
round would be one too many. Since his defeat of
Dupre, Demsky has improved immensely. lie has only
been in the game for 12 months, and with another
year under the tuition of a Criqui might become a
world-beater.
Sydney Sailing Club’s 18ft. handicap last
Saturday attracted 20 starters. Plume, with a jig
of 6|min., and a new mainsail bent on spars, eked
out to the required length by sundry bolts and lumps
of iron, was the first to ease away at the Red
Light with Usee, to spare from Pastime, which pre-
ceded Advance (H. E. Thompson) by 26sec. Spin-
nakers, from mast and topsail head, were skied
for the run to Shark Island, where on jibbing at
the buoy, Advance, thanks to her big extra, had
reduced Pastime’s lead by 10. sec. Back to Clark
Island mark came the fleet with all extras out for
the light air, when Advance’s big spinnaker asserted
itself and Thompson’s charge hauled a wind for the
second spasm at the mark 9sec. ahead of Pastime,
Plume being third 6sec. astern. The punch to Tay-
lor Bay saw the , ex-Bananalander again eat the
blow to such good purpose that she was first to twist
for the stretch across to Shark Island. Plume was
displaced and hopelessly outclassed, and Advance
almost filled up. Pastime (George Drysdale) eventu-
ally brought the flag down with ISsec. to spare
from Advance, which preceded Swastika by 34sec.
Britannia (Georgie Robinson), coming like a hydro-
plane, was robbed of third money by a bumpkin
length.

Parramatta made a mark in Sydney bowls
finals on Saturday. Reps, of the old town trounced

seven rinks.

“Bogey” Beaurepaire continues to adver-
tise the uses of the despised “trudgeon” stroke. Not
only did he defeat Ludy Langer and Pua Kealoha in
the 220yds. championship of Australia last week, but
he rubbed it in by cutting out the furlong in 2min.
27sec., which is the slickest time ever recorded for
the event, and 1 l-ssec. better than Norman Ross’s
figures for the race when he defeated “Bogey” by a
touch last year, after bumping the little Victorian at
the finish. W. Longworth comes next with 2min.
29 2-ssec., put up in 1913-14. He notched 2min.
27 2-ssec. for 220yds. in the State Championship
1911-12, but the swim was never recognised by the
record-compilers. It has been repeatedly stated in
the press that Beaurepaire’s 2min. 27see. is the best
effort ever recorded by an Australian. That is not
the fact, for “Bogey” himself has twice bettered it
—at Kalgoorlie last year, when he did 2inin. 26
3-ssec., and at Vancouver homew’ard bound from the
recent Olympic Games, when he was clocked to do
2min. 26sec. However, Fred Lane, erstwhile world’s
and Australian champion, can claim even better times
than “Bogey,” for he cut out 220yds. at Jersey
(Channel Islands) in August, 1900, in the marvellous
time of 2min. 19 2-ssec., a week after he had
annexed the world’s Olympic championship at Paris
over 200 metres, virtually 220yds. in 2min. 25

Ihe costly sport of backing horses having
resumed its course in Victoria, the Newmarket
Handicap comes due this week. Postponement of
the V.R.C. meeting for only a few days is an upset
to the arranged order of things, whilst the total
disappearance of the Futurity meeting at Caulfield
has leit the six furlongs flutter in a state so much
more open than usual that punters will be chary of
trying to pick the winner in once or twice Last
year, as it happened, the result was a blow’ to all
the rival followers of recent form. An uncertain
mare, at a longish price, ran home from an un-
certain colt, followed by old Cetigne. Mares are
improving every day at this time of year, and maybe
another of them will join the lot who have already
done the trick. One must respect the sex which has
the best average (reckoning its numerical inferi-
ority) in Newmarkets. Three out of the last five
winners have been mares. One of the other two
winners was Cetigne, who also ran third last year
so it the old campaigner were to score a win or
place, the man in the street would remember that
he had fully expected it. Age hath its victories,
however, no less than previous form, arid the chances
are that Cetigne is a trifle, too old for the job this
iJ rne *xT Nothing can be strongly recommended for
the Newmarket at time of writing, but the mar-
ket will offer an exceptionally strong tip in
tiie event of anything being backed down to a short
price within 48 hours of the start. The writer will
fancy something in James Scobie’s stable, for a
combination of reasons, one of which is that the
stable cannot always remain out of luck. It is safe
to suggest that the Australian Cup will probably
be captured by something carrying not more than
7st. 71b., at which convenient weight Natutical has
been let into the long race. As a son of Sea
Prince, whose stock shows stamina, the V.R.C.
Derby runner-up looks more likely than most of
them, hut in the meantime he has to meet Salitros
in the Leger. Form in the Lcger, also the Bruns-
wick Stakes on the same afternoon, will surely be
somewhat of a guide to guessers re the Australian
Cup.

At the Wanganui (M.L.) J. C.’s Autumn
Meeting the two sprint races, the Flying and the
Jackson Stakes—both six furlongs—were looked on
as gifts to Silver Link and Gloaming. The former
is at present the Welkin gelding’s only rival in the
Dominion. Gloaming took the Jackson Stakes easily
enough, witli Silver Link as sole opponent, but the
daughter of Secret Link was not able to give Early
Dawn 2711>. in the Flying. The Wellington Cup
winner, Maihoa (Hallovvmas—Fairy Gold), who re-
cently made the new M.L. 12-furlong record at
Trentham, was a head behind Marqueteur in the
Wanganui Stakes.

The first day of Victorian A.A.A. cham-
pionships on Saturday made two fresh niches on the
State record slate. Both were in the field events.
K. J. Naukler's (N.S.W.) discus throw of 109 ft. 7Jin.
was 10-Jin. better than E. R. Caughey’s (America)
efiort on the same ground in 1914; and A. W.
Hunt (Melb.) heaved the javelin 144 ft., which also
knocked out Caughey’s best by Bft. Naukler, who
is Finland’s Consul, also did 143 ft. Sin. in the latter
event. Last year’s title-holders again on top were
D. W. Gale (Uni.) in the 100yds. (10 l-ssec), H.
W. Harbison (Uni.) in the high jump (sft. Bin.),
L. F. Edmunds (Uni.), in the 440yds. hurdles
(62 l-ssee.), and A. R. Walton (Carlton) in the pole
vault (9ft. 6in.). In the half-mile, Paul J. Carroll
(last year’s runner-up) defeated B. J. Linehan
(holder) in 2min. 4jsec.; and C. G. Manley and
W. 11. Brown both finished ahead of S. E. Nicholls
(holder) in the three miles. Manley’s fine win was
the boil-over of the meeting, and a great improve-
ment on his club championship and last year’s
Australasian championship form at Sydney.
Carlton licked Melbourne in Vic. inter-
club amateur athletic championship last week by
46 points to 33. The best efforts were V. T.
Kelly’s 120yds. hurdles (16 4-ssec), T. Radich’s
mile walk (7min. 3 2-ssec), and P. Carroll’s mile
(4min. 45 l-ssec.).
Alf Grenda shamed the Sydney handi-
capper on Wednesday by winning the mile handicap
(from scratch) by 20yds. in 2min. On Saturday
he won a heat in the mile handicap in lniin. 59sec.,
but missed a place in the final. Later on he took
the five-mile scratch from Jackie Clark and C. L.
Papworth in lOmin. 50sec. In a. special three-heat
mile matcli Bill Erskine defeated C. L. Papworth
by two to one.
* * * *
In the Vic. Amateur cycling champion-
ships last week A. V. Brown won both the mile
(2min. 44sec.) and five miles (12min. 39sec). T.
Ling (Albert Park) was second in both. Brown,
who previously raced as a professional, was recently
reinstated after doing his bit with the Flying Corps
in France. The holder of the title (A. J. Mc-
Donald) lost his chance in both races in the usual
way: he punctured. For the Australian cham-
pionships at Victoria this week-end A. E. Hannan
and W. Madigan (N.S.W.). and J. King, A. Cgstag-
nola, L. Munro and J. Humphries (Q.) will make an
effort to bring away the titles.
BALLAD OF DISCONTENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our King who yesteryear denounced strong drink,
And counselled all to stick to water pure,
Has failed us, and the champagne glasses clink
At ev’ry royal function. The allure
Of Adam’s ale and Nature’s limpid beer
Has faded like the matutinal mist
So far as Royalty’s concerned I fear.
How can a wowser be a Loyalist?
The Prince, whose youthful face and boyish smile
Gave promise of a curate’s innocence,
Is steeped apparently in racecourse guile:
He bets in any sum from pounds to pence.
He flirts —so hint the scribes of the Renown—
And many melancholy proofs exist,
That he, when asked, will always keep one down.
How can a wowser be a Loyalist?
His royal father does not seem to care:
He docs not chide, rebuke or even sneer.
Instead he sits, while bishops sniff and glare,
Holding a ’phone to his expectant ear.
Waiting for news of State? Alas! Not so.
He waits to hear what punch made Wells desist
When he had Gunboat Smith upon the go.
How can a wowser be a Loyalist?
Envoy.
Give us a King to follow in whose coat
The azure ribbon of abstention shines:
One who relies upon his castle moat
For all the drink he swallows when he dines:
A Prince who never jazzes, never rags,
Or knows the meaning of a betting-list—
This failing, each true wowser’s int’rest flags
And he declines to be a Loyalist.

Pen
THE
All-British
Fountain Pen
In your pocket
a sealed tube
Dozens of Onoto Pens are sent every day
through the post full of ink, often in silk-
lined cases. They get shaken and tossed
about in the' mail bags. But it is per-
fectly safe to send them in this way.
For the British-made Onoto cannot leak
When you close it, with a turn of the
finger and thumb, it becomes a sealed
tube. Not a drop of ink can possibly
escape.
When you open it again, you find the
finger-hold dry though the ink in the nib
remains fresh and moist, so that you can
start writing at once.
And when you want more ink the Onoto
fills itself instantly from any ink supply.
It is the simplest pen to use.

Permanent Hair Waving
Accentuates Attractiveness
The many advantages of softly waved hair are
too obvious to need much commendation. To
the smart woman, so important a part does it
play in her coiffure, that it has become quite a
fashionable craze. Farmer’s use a special, per-
manent hair waving process which produces
exquisite waves that remain the same even
after shampooing, and does not in any way
effect the growth, or destroy the natural sheen.
Appointments may be booked by personal
application in the Hairdressing Salon, Third
Floor, or by phoning, City, Eleven Thousand.

Whence comes
all that is
exclusive
The St. Ivilda Pier reception of the Gov-
ernor was a picturesque success. The
Esplanade made a high background of dense
crowds and acres of bunting. Our bay,
broad and blue and breezy, looked in its
most effective mood. The Naval Reserve
guard and a brisk salute added to the stage-
effect when the Government launch cut over
the water. The important blaze of gorgeous
official dress was as good as any pantomime,
and one new aide was in scarlet and a tower-
ing busby. The Earl-Governor was in full
dress, and his lady wore tailored white cloth
that got excellent effect from the surround-
ing gaudy uniforms; and she dangled a big
rope of pearls to dazzle envious eyes. Pre-
mier Lawson came with them in the launch.
The Mayor of St. Ivilda had the day of his
life, and his councillors were in full array.
Town-Clerk Chamberlain read the official
welcome. He is an alert, exact young man,
and he stage-managed the pier importants
with the tact of a general. The motor-pro-
cession was well timed, and moved off at
the right moment for the Melbourne Town
Hall for more speeches and addresses and
fuss.
Twice on the way to the city from St.
Kilda pier the new Gov. lost the plume from
his cocked hat. It was made more secure
after the second moulting. Probably his
Ex.’s private opinion was that the whole
uniform, cocked hat and all, was too stagey,
and lie must have envied the State members
he mbt who wore sac suits. One incident at
the swearing-in that was carried out almost
dramatically was Lieut.-Governor Irvine’s
retirement from the central chair on the
Legislative Council dais as soon as the Earl
subscribed to the oath of allegiance and the
oath of office. Until the swearing was done
Irvine was George V.’s representative, but
when Stradbroke produced his credentials
and complied with formalities he threw up
the sponge, so to speak, and swapped chairs
with his new Ex. with as much formality as,
say, the Noble Grand in an Oddfellows’ lodge
effects an exchange with an Immediate Past
Grand. As he stood up to do the cross-
over everybody admired the brilliant blue
and gold rig-out that the Iceberg sported.
In some slight degree the Countess of
Stradbroke resembles Mrs. Janet Clarke as
Melbourne society knew the wife of the
baronet of Rupertswood and Cliveden, say,
30 years ago. Perhaps the fact that Mrs.
Clarke’s son, Frank (Minister for Public
Works), was chairman of the Cabinet recep-
tion committee, brought the resemblance to
mind. By the way, Frank, with the assist-
ance of R. W. V. McCall, Clerk of the
Uppah Chambah, stage-managed the wel-
come well at a minimum of cost.
State Parliament House had a reception
for the Earl Governor and his Countess the
evening of their arrival. Parliamentary Sas-
siety swamped Queen’s Hall half-an-hour
before the advent of the vice-regal proces-
sion. The management made preparations so
that the crowd might look at —but not touch
—the exhibits. Before a side door they laid
a strip of scarlet felt which they roped off
carefully with velvet ropes. The Governor
and co. were juggled through this side door
and arranged in two careful rows behind
the barrier, looking like waxworks. Sassiet.v
scrambled up to the limit of the ropes and
stared till its eyes ached. Earl Governor
was not put out of countenance, but beamed
back at the pack. He looks a jovial soul,
with a florid face, Kitchener moustache and
a glint of humor in his grey eyes. After
the first impressive pose of the party and
“God Save,” the guests were run through a
race in single file to hand-shake. Some man-
aged a curtsey, and were criticised by the
other women waiting their turn.
The Countess might have stepped out of
a Ouida novel. She is tall (nearly six feet),
willowy, slender, languid, and has the heavy
coronet of bronze-brown hair that belongs
by right to a novel heroine who wears
heavily-jewelled tiaras. On Thursday even-
ing she carried about a hundredweight of
diamonds in her tiara, and they were topped
by 15 huge opals. Her gown, which ignored
her back, was of long folds of lettuce-green
silk woven in with gold threads. Her shoes
were green and gold and the gown reached
her insteps. A four-inch-high collar of dia-
monds and opals braced the swan neck. The
collar would scarcely fit the wrist of
some of our matrons. One large Sassiety
dame wailed “Why do they send us such thin
women as Governors’ wives—we cannot copy
their dress.” The large one was so huge
that her dressmaker had added a drop cur-
tain from shoulder to hem at the back be-
cause the fashionable one insisted on a
“sheath” gown.
The deposed Irvine was in the show row
along with his plump lady and their daugh-
ter. Two demure daughters of the Governor
wore correct evening gowns a la Princess
Mary. The white frocks were cut modestly
high in the neck and long in the skirt.
Poodle collars of ostrich feathers covered
the neck to the ears. One daughter is a
black-browed lass with mamma’s slender
figure and big brown eyes. There is a new
pink-and-white aide with the dinkiest little
fair moustache. He made good the wax-
works-show time in looking anxiously over
the prettiest girls in the crowd.
The reception was merely a “How-do.”
From Queen’s Hall the guests of honor were
spirited to another strip of scarlet carpet in
the supper-room. Everybody stood up and
munched cakes and ices. A band played in
the corridors, but the youngsters merely
shrugged their shoulders—they know from
sad experience there may be no jazzing at
The House, however tantalising the music,
and in spite of the long, lovely jazzing range
of the corridors. The reception was over
by 10 o’clock. It was a sweltering affair,
and big guns in official dress looked apoplec-
tic. Monash was nearly strangled by his
collar decorations, and the new Governor
looked as if he thought the Powers might
have suggested tropical uniform for his even-
ing wear. Still, everybody was cheerful in
spite of the heat., because a rumor breezed
about in a cool way saying that the Strike
was over.
Martin Hannah, Independent Labor mem-
ber for Collingwood, chief advocate for the
abolition of imported Governors, was one of
the string of Assembly members who “pro-
cessed” before Earl Stradbroke in the Uppah
Chambah and gripped his hand. Stradbroke
has got a lease of office for five years, and
Martin will have to. make the best of him.
Although he barracked for local Governors,
he was on good terms with the Stanleys,
who wrote to him after they got back to
England.
The palm for colossal impudence was
awarded by McArthur, J., during the week
to Mrs. Ida Myra Whitty, of Fitzroy, who
petitioned for a divorce against her husband,
Billjim Laurence Henry Whitty, of Caulfield.
Seeing that she hadn’t a legal leg to stand
on, her counsel sought to withdraw the peti-
tion, but the husband, who had lodged a
counter-petition, objected. The wdfe’s case
was dismissed, and then it was shown that
she had been “carrying on” unblushingly
with Wallace Mitchell, of Fitzroy. One of
the thrilling adventures she had with her
admirer was an aeroplane trip to Sydney.
Evidence was given that when the divorce
papers w r ere served on her, Mrs. Whitty said
she desired to marry the other man and
“give .her child a name.” Whitty got his
decree nisi, the wife her certificate for cheek,
and co-respondent Mitchell the bill of costs.
Edward P. has given his book on the Aus-
tralian tour to the Pearsons, so that the
profits will all go to St. Dunstan’s —the
wonderful school for blinded soldiers in
England. Practically every British soldier
blmded in the war
went through St.
Dun s t a n’s, and
dozens of Diggers
have had heart put
into them from les-
sons learned there.
This is a portrait of
Dame Ethel Pearson,
wife of Sir Arthur,
who has been the eyes
of her blind husband
through all his vast
work at St. Dun-
stan’s. She helped
him in his book,
“Victory over Blind-
ness.” which strives
pluckily to prove
that blindness need
not be a calamity.
Dame Ethel has a brother, Mr. Frank Fraser,
who has been growing wool and other things
at a country plf»ce near Berwick, Vic.
Captain Eric Harrison, one of the bosses
of our Flying Corps, has his wife safely back
from a hilarious holiday at Jervis Bay,
where the boats are. Mrs. Harrison was the
plump little Prendergast girl—an Irish-Aus-
tralian type with a peaches complexion and
the singing voice of an angel.
On their return from the Speck the vice-
regal Forsters farewelled their cheery little
naval gent.-help Norman, who streaked off
to his native Fog with startling unostenta-
tion. He is said to have been called home
by an urgent private-affairs cable, and Mrs.
Rumor says he hopes to get back again when
the matter in hand is settled.
The Forster lady is said to shrink before
the fierce glare of the vice-regal limelight,
which is unfortunately part and parcel of
the gubernatorial office. Daughter Mrs. Pitt-
Rivers is taking notice once more after an
operation, and hopes to pick up the house-
keeping keys again before the winter fires
are lighted in the vice-regal humpy.
Jolly Admiral Grant’s pet preoccupation
is his dog, a smart spaniel which was pre-
sented to him by the late K. of K., under
whose stern wing the pup saw the battle-
front from its first fiery angle. When
Admiral Percy was told his beloved dawg
could not get an overseas passage on a
mailboat, he was about to dash off and book
berths for two on a tramp steamer; but the
shipping heads, in recognition of the spaniel’s
wai; services, relented, and agreed to allow
the dog a special permit.
A packed house gave Dorothy Brunton a
warm welcome at Her Majesty’s on Satur-
day. When the golden head popped out of
the screened doorway in the back of the
stage, proceedings were suspended until the
multitude had thoroughly bruised its hands.
Dot told us afterwards that she loved us
“all to death” for our reception. The little
sunbeam wore some bonnie effects in pink,
blue, white and silver, but her garments were
genteel and well-behaved beside the tor-
tured and harrowing confections in which
the showgirls tried to preserve their shapes.
Pretty Winnie Tait was dressed up in the
colors of the fuchsia, and had a sort of ver-
andah running all round. There were others
in canary, orange, mauve and grass-green,
and most had outlines that put all the
curves in the wrong places. One of the
most remarkable was an exceedingly
slender and tightly-clad brunette who
postured sinuously in black and looked like
a movie vamp that had been run through
a mangle. All the boxes were full of lus-
trous visions and mere men, Maggie Dickin-
son squeezing into the family enclosure
with mamma and Flossie Wenman, whilst
on the other side Hugh Mclntosh halved a
pen with one of his Hebrew aidekongs, next
door to Mrs. Geoff Syme and a pack of
flappers.
The Willie Camerons gave a dance last
week at their Macedon humpy—Cameron
Lodge—and Melbourne went, up in a stream
of motors to the frivol. The verandahs of the
bungalow are wide enough for a ball-
room, and electric lights were hung all
through the gardens and along the borders
of the creek. There is Virginia creeper
round the verandahs, and the hostess had
the autumn tints as a foil to her lemon-
tinted gown. Mrs. Cameron gave the dance
for some Sydney visitors; Zaney, Phyllis and
Joyce Carr, who are over from Darling
Point. Phyllis wore flounces of black tulle
hung from a tiny bodice of jet. Joyce was
in baby-pink satin, while sister Zaney got
into a butterfly dress of brilliant contrasts
in colored tulle. Macedon houses round
about were packed with house parties for
the week-end. The Leigh Falkiners were up,
and Mrs. Frank Clarke tooted along from
Rupertswood with Wilma Clarke. Mrs. W.
L. Baillieu brought Claire Baillieu and Peggy
Robertson, and Jean Foster, and the Grim-
wades motored from Maffra ; while the Tay-
lors, from Overnewton, and the McCaugheys
were also among the long-distance guests.
Eric Connolly’s pretty little wife is con-
valescing nicely after a severe operation.
Vimy House, which used' to be St. Luke’s
Hospital, has successfully looked after the
job.
Ministerial, Farmers’ Union and Labor
members are incensed against Premier Law-
son (Vic.) because he scotched the trip to
S.A. while the strike was on. They say
he put them in a bad light, as no cost to
the country would have been incurred. But
Lawson is on safe ground, and the public will
be with him. It would surely have meant
some expense to put on extra sleeping-cars
for two or three days to carry 50 or 60
members and relatives to Adelaide, but apart
from that, what was the good of economising
by cutting off country and race trains if
facilities for legislators’ jaunts were, pro-
vided? Lawson thought it better to stand
a growl from the disappointed excur-
sionists than to have the Government made
ridiculous.
Dr. Charles Mills’s second son, Neilson,
who manages the family sheep ranch,
Uardry, at Hay, will presently hit the matri-
monial track with a pretty little Hay dam-
sel, Miss Toby Gleeson, whose mother was
a Tyson. Neilson’s squatter-brother Charlie
tied- up little Sylvia Ffreneh, the attractive
flapper whom Melba once adopted. The
eldest Mills son, Ainslie, married the late
Col. Tom Price’s only daughter, but died a
few years later. He served in the S’African
War.
Congratulations are pouring into the M.
H. Baillieus’ Toorak home on the call of
the Stork. By this time the string of names
for the wee girlie has been about decided
upon, but the probability is that all will be
discarded as she grows up, and some whimsi-
cal or pet one substituted.
Bloomsbury can’t be such a fashion-for-
saken and utterly impossible part of London
as the horror of Tilly’s young man’s mother
indicated when the awful lady heard of where
Tilly’s family dwelt. Lady Diana Cooper,
the Duke of Rutland’s daughter, who has gone
to work as a professional film actress, was
living in a flat at Bloomsbury when she
announced her fell purpose. The blood of all
the Manners ancestry runs in the veins of
Bady Diana, remember. Her family connec-
tions are supposed to represent the last word
in pude of race, for it w,as a Manners who
wrote :
Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die,
But leave us still our old nobility,
Why, with Lady Diana’s flat in it, Blooms-
bury couldn t be quite beyond the pale of re-
fined consideration.
Ena Smith, the charming young Banana-
lander pictured here by Ruth Hollick, is a
clever potter or pot-
teress. She is
learned in peasant
pottery-lore, and
has a great respect
for the clays of
Australia and those
of her native State
in particular. The
youngster’s designs
are original, and
the painting of her
pottery is exquisite
work. Ena is the
.daughter of Evan
Smith, Federal
Director of Works
in Bananaland, a
man much interested
in the clays o f
Queensland and
something of a pottist himself. Daughter
Ena shows a streak of genius in following
papa’s lead. The Technical Schools in Bris-
bane have taught her much in solid ground-
work; ’‘but,’ - says the enthusiastic young
potter, “one discovers fascinating new things
as the work builds up.” Dad has been in Mel-
bourne on Federal work, and has left Ena
here to study painting for a while with Mel-
drum.
Society has been bitten by a new microbe
—a healthy one this time. In England
nursery nurses are going out of fashion.
The up-to-date matron has given up petting
toy-terriers and taken to pushing a pram,
and she who cannot run her own gondola
is on a fair way to becoming a social out-
cast. Heaven only knows what infant
Hector Plantagenet thinks of the whole busi-
ness—maybe lie wishes the welfare racket
had been confined to the Pekinese spaniel.
The craze has not caught on here yet, but
Lady Digby lias done her best to give society
matrons the hint. At the Forster couple’s
first garden-party this charming young per-
son deserted the guests in the fountain court
to take a hand at pushing her infant’s pram
along the terrace.
Adelaide says a word or two: —
The Memorial Hospital fete was opened on Friday
by his Ex. Lady Weigall was also present, and over
500 women took part. More than 3000 tickets
were sold for the affair, which lasted two days.
Svd Kidman, who is greatly interested in the hos-
pital, performed the “opening” ceremony on the
second day. The Terraces, Avenue-road, are well
adapted for such a fote.
When the tennis tournaments are over some of
the players will be figuring in a different sort of
court. Everything at the tournament was run on
time, and one fair player was calmly watching other
matches when she realised that her game was about
due. The police caught her speeding in her car
down the Terrace to fetch shoes and racquet, and
a summons resulted. A well-known Adelaide business
man, member of the inter-State team, was caught
on the same afternoon —-same offence, similar sum-
mons.
Judy, daughter of the Fearons, said “I will” at
St. Paul’s on Wednesday to Geff, son of the late
W. Hall Henderson and Mrs. Hall Henderson, of
St. Peter’s. Archdeacon Clampett tied the knot,
the two buxom bridesmaids were Millicent Fearon
and Winnie Ringwood, and their squires were the
Downs brothers. Big reception afterwards at Grand
Central Hotel, where the bride's people are staying.
Then the pair made tracks for the eastern States.
John Lewis and his wife, of Commonella, Pros-
pect, accompanied by their family, leave by the
Narkunda for Europe. The Fitzroy Croquet Club
tendered the lady a farewell afternoon on Wednes-
day.
F. S. Bleechmore and his Mrs. left last week on
a five months’ tour of New Zealand. Some more
hopeful people left Adelaide last week en route for
Tasmania; Mrs. LI. K. Wendt, Miss Lois Wendt, Mrs.
Gill-Williams, Miss Betty Harvey and Miss Romola
Taylor were among them, bound for Sandy Bay.
Audrey Wells, who is an associate of the Mel-
bourne Conservatorium, has returned to her native
State to take up teaching. Some months ago she
gave a successful recital here in conjunction with
Clifford Lathlean.
A popular magistrate passed out on Thursday when
William Johnstone died in his sleep at Ivingswood,
the residence of his son-in-law, W. C. Horroeks. He
was in his 78th year, and his name was prominently
before the public some years ago in connection with
his judgment in the matter of seamen deserting
from foreign ships at Port Adelaide. He married
a sister of the late John Cherry.
Archbishop Spence returned to Adelaide by the
R.M.S. Osterley on Thursday, accompanied by Father
Hogan, O.P v who has been absent since 1919. Dr.
O’Connor was also on the boat, but bound for Arma-
dale, Vie.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT.
Your Directors herewith submit their Report and Financial Statement for the year ending December
31, 1920. During the period the Directors, in view of the very satisfactory progress which the
business has made, resolved to erect one of the most commodious and up-to-date factories in Aus-
tralia, plans for which had been carefully worked out by the management during the proceeding
period. In order to provide for this, and for the expanding trade, the balance of 5/- per Share on
the 50,000 “B” Preference Shares was called up, and a further issue of 110,000 Ordinary Shares of
10/- each made. It is expected that the new factory will be completed during the current financial
year, and the concentration of the manufacturing and administrative operations of the Company in
one centre will result both in economy and efficiency of production. The Net Profit for the year
amounts to £29,454/16/-, and the credit at Profit and Loss account is £32,098/7/8, which the
Directors recommend allocating as follows:
Dividend on A preference shares for the half-year at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum £1,040 15 2
Dividend on B preference shares for the half-year at the rate of 9 per cent, per annum 1,968 15 0

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
From
David Jones
[?]
SYDNEY
In pre-war days the week before Ash
Wednesday and Easter week were the con-
gested areas of the year in the matter of
orange blossom and wedding rings, and Lent
itself proved its similarity to Heaven in that
there was in it neither marrying nor giving
in marriage; but now from Ash Wednesday
till ’Easter Monday there is a continuous
shower of confetti, and your wise padre
simply gathers his marriage fees while he
may.
In last week’s queue of matrimonial aspi-
rants were Lilian Florence Earp and Flight-
Lt. Frank Mason, who became one at the
hands of Archgaiters D’Arcy Irvine in St.
Andrew’s one sunny afternoon. Lilian
Florence wore the usual white satin, made
long as to body, the straightness of which
merged into a wired flounce of Mechlin
lace. Several yards of tulle veil and an arm-
ful of white blooms finished off her outfit.
There were three bridesmaids, colored like
leaves in March, principal Joyce Parker
being wrapped in palely-yellowed satin and
tulle; Argie (not short for Argentina)
Mitchell looked like a bronze-brown leaf;
Avhile Doreen Young’s satin and tulle was as
the heart of a La France rose in its second
blooming. Bride’s mother was in the henna
outfit she Avore at daughter Dora’s wedding
in the flood-time before Christmas. Over
a hundred guests lapped up the wedding feast
at Highgate, where dad, Avho still has a
trained nurse in attendance, had to wait
till the party came back from the church.
The pair Avent off on a motoring honeymoon,
Lilian Florence wrapped in a duck of a rose
suede motor coat.
A perfectly gorgeous collection of evening-
cloaks sat in the pevrs of St. John’s, Darling-
hurst, while Eileen (“Tiger”) Forrest became
Mrs. Lawrence Cadell. All the usual trappings
embellished her, the white satin being cut
on classic lines, but the conventional anaemic
pallor of the bridal bouquet was exchanged
for a sheaf of tiger-lilies. Linda Moses was
bridesmaid and wore a gOAvn of turquoise-
blue for the job; bridegroom’s brother Owen
was best man, and Roy Forrest gave his
sister away. Nearly 150 Potts Pointers,
Darling Pointers and Piper Pointers dashed
back to the Cairo for the shivoo, which waS
a very well-dressed affair. Bride’s mother
wore silver lace over grey satin and a black
velvet hat, and bridegroom’s mother, Mrs.
William Cadell, was in black satin. Mrs.
Sep Levy was there in one of those little
black dresses and a designing black hat, and
Mrs. Philip Morton added a large black hat
leaping out into points at the sides to her
rigout, while daughter Jean looked sweet in
gold tissue and a beautiful white hat. Pretty
little Mrs. Roy Forrest wore black and gold,
and her good-looking mother, Mrs. Colley,
lavender and .silver. Young Mrs. Eakin
brought her handsome doctor, and Mrs. Roy
Bucldand looked younger than ever in gold
tissue. The Jaques family was there in
force, papa Jaques proposing the bride’s
health. Mrs. Sheldon was in a Lorelei
shade of pale green, and wore an osprey at
the side of her small, tight-fitting black
toque. Gwen Colley, in pale blue, and
Melanie Collins, in a handsome black-and-
gold evening coat, were others at the feast.
Ex-soldier Lawrence hangs out his sign with
Sandy (Lionel) Jaques.
The bride comes of a military family.
Everybody does nowadays in a sense, of
course, but hers is more martial than most.
Her late father. Captain Forrest, served in
the South African War. Afterwards he
settled down as a farmer near the Alex.
Hays’ lovely old South Coast hqme at Cool-
angatta. The family are keen on sport, and
(like the late Mi’s. Henry Forsyth) had a
steeplechase course on the premises. Roy
Forrest, the young woman’s brother, was
one of the Light Horsemen who transferred
to the A.F.A. in 1916.
The plump, dimpled chuckle that is the
real Dorothy Brunton fareAArelled her Sydney
the other night, and the Gallery’s best girl
trims her sails once more for London, when,
as all her world knows, she could settle doivn
with a wedding ring on an immense chunk
of Queensland, or, with a similar attachment,
on a considerable area of Victoria.
Sydney’s medical women have formed
themselves into a registered association. Dr.
Harriet Biffin, who has been elected the first
president, was among the first women to
graduate in medicine at Sydney University.
She has a big practice, and in partnership
with her is Dr. Helen Braye. daughter of the
well-known Newcastle family. Drs. Lucy
Gullet and Margaret Harper are secretary
and treasurer, while the committee comprises
plump and pleasing Dr. Constance D’Arcy,
Drs. Marjory Little, Nell Farrar and Mar-
jory Ross. The Association’s first aim is to
initiate a movement for a hospital entirely
staffed by women.
One of the newest engagements is that of
Ursula Catterall to Telford Simpson. He’s
a son of E. P. Simpson, and she is perhaps
most known as the sister of the graceful
Cecily Catterall (Mrs. Duncan). Ursula
was one of the lucky girls who were invited
to all the jolly little private parties during
H.R.II.’s romp through Sydney’s cherished
conventionalities.
Telford Simpson is a young man with a
future. He is a member of the big firm of
attorneys of which his father has been the
brains for quarter of a century, and an only
son. He possesses all “Ted” Simpson’s
astuteness and breadth of outlook, even if he
hasn’t yet acquired the other’s suavity—a
gift that has been priceless to him and to
clients in settling contentious matters.
Young Simpson had a distinguished war
career as a bombing pilot in the R.A.F.
The death of poor Captain Jack Burns,
son of the shipping magnate and brother
of Captain Jim Burns, which occurred last
week, was, in a sense, a happy release. He
had been very ill indeed latterly. He was
delicate when.the war began, and if he had
only considered himself would never have
gone. But he persisted; was passed as fit
eventually, and landed at Gallipoli. He did
good work on this death-trap and in Pales-
tine, but came back a changed man. The
Army which he loved so well contained no
cheerier or kindlier officer.
Sydney’s old friend Grace Palotta has
been having tremendous successes as a pro-
ducer of amateur theatrical entertainments
in Colombo. A large cast played Paul
Rubens’s “Betty” under her direction last
month, and the local papers put most of the
blame for the rapturous reception the show
got on Grace’s shapely shoulders. When
not diverting herself on these lines she con-
ducts a smart millinery establishment, deal-
ing in all the latest Paris fashions, and the
name of it is “Aimde.” She lives at the
Galle Face Hotel, where the sea breeze eter-
nally sighs through the open windows and
the palms wave and the native swindlers
offer their goods, while on the red Maidon
outside the rickshaw boys argue and the
ravens complain.
Longreach (Q.) was to the fore at the wed-
ding at St. Philip’s the other night, when
Canon Bellingham linked up George Ronald
James, of Melbourne, and Mary Katrine
Langston, of Inverarie, Jericho, daughter
of the Frank Langstons, until quite recently
of Langdale, Longreach. Bessie Inglis, of
Wellshot station, Longreach, looking like a
mauve-and-gold butterfly, was the brides-
maid, and Tom Cory, from the same district,
was best man. Bride’s father and mother
extended the welcome hand at Petty’s. The
George Ronald James’s new address is Sea
Lake, Vic.
Herewith a photo of Margaret Baxter,
formerly of Sydney, but for many years
camped in London. She discovered herself
in the early days of the war. With three
brothers serving in
the A.1.F.; she set to
work to barrack for
Aussies, and as an
hon. organiser, hos-
pital assistant, lec-
turer and general
rouseabout, she be-
came a fuse to fire
the lukewarm o n
this side. The
super-density of the
War Office officials
was penetrated b y
the Australian’s
fierce patriotism for
her far-off land, and
they captured Mar-
garet and used her
as lecturer, enter-
tainer, odd-job girl
and general utility in the muddied battle-
fields of Flanders and France. General
“Birdie,” who had a noticing habit, was
her firm ally. “You know, I hope.” he
wrote at the finish, “how really grateful I
am to you for all you have done —straight
from your heart —for our boys through all
these long years. And I know how very
grateful they are to you.” Keen business
capacity and personal charm kindle the
flame of Margaret’s success. She raised
over £lOO,OOO for war funds by her
brilliant organisation. Her latest feat
for charity was the working up of
the great bazaar in the Albert Hall
(London), for the Barnardo Home for
Boys. The Duke of York (the slim under-
study to elder* brother EdwArdi P.)
opened the Fair, which netted about £BOOO.
Princess Alice, the pretty daughter of the
Duchess of Albany and the late Prince Leo-
pold, handed the invaluable Margaret a
gold bangle in recognition of her work.
Pretty Titian-haired Violet Mackay,. second
daughter of the W. H. Mackays, of Anam-
bah, West Maitland, and Redleaf, Double
Bay, says “I will” this week to Egmont
Walker, twin son of the J. T. Walkers, of
Wallaroy, Edgecliff. Professor Macintyre
ties the knot at St. Stephen’s.
The big-game Currs (their station is up
near the Gulf, and is named Inkerman) are
resting at Petty’s after their East African
jaunt, where the two boys had their first
taste of big hunting. Mrs. Curr was the
envied lady who wrapped out the cold of
last winter with a wonderful set of blue
monkey-furs, won by her own good man’s
bow and arrows, or ’tanyrate the modern
equivalent.
Here’s the latest photograph of Frank
Coffee, whose book, “Forty Years on the
Pacific,” made its appearance a week or
two ago. Frank has
crossed the Equator
36 times and has
been 18 times around
the world, and in
his wanderings has
gathered a fund of
information—the in-
teresting details that
your intellectual
traveller fails to ob-
serve, but that the
ordinary man and
woman love to hear.
He was one of the
founders of the Citi-
zens’ Life Assurance.
His son, a promising
journalist, was killed
during the war, but
his two young mar-
ried daughters have made him seven times a
grandfather—and his grandchildren are all
boys. In this over-girled community they
should have special honors from the Ministry
of Motherhood. Think what a fuss the Kaiser
would have made of them!
Roy White, who collapsed suddenly the
other day at a private hospital in Darling-
hurst from a blood clot, nearly a fortnight
after a successful operation, was known to
his friends as a rather brilliant chap who
had been a student at Heidelberg, after a
short stay,at Cambridge. Roy went up with
Captain Matthews in the first Australian
Aerial Derby. He was an ardent cricketer,
and followed the Tests with the greatest
interest, right up to the time death took him
where he sat out in the sun on the morning
before the last match. His mother is now
the Countess Morner, and owns the large
block of North Side flats known as the
Astoria, but still remembered as Beulah.
Have you seen the country beauties come
to town, apple-cheeked and ruddy, smiling
through the sheaves of wheat in the shop
windows? Beauty pumpkins and carrot
belles drop a curtsey - to monster bananas
from the Northern Rivers; nuts and fruits
of all kinds in the quick flesh and the dried
glow ingratiatingly through the plate-glass,
and young Sydney flocks from school armed
with pencil and exercise to make a tally of
the riches of the Baekblocks. Squirming
under the elbows of the gazers the kids push
their way to the front, and then with exercise-
book plastered up against the window they
go for their lives. “They got soap here,”
shrieked a 12-year-old lump of brawn to his
small, silent cobber. “Won’t be soap,” mused
the small one; then his eye lighted on some
jars of honey. “Beeswax !” he yelled in tri-
umph—“me mother rubs her iron with it.”
At Gowing Bros.’ window before Ethel
Kelman’s modelling of an Outback home-
stead, there was a tremendous crush. “Mum,
where’s their waterhole?” shrilled a three-
year-old to the great delight of a young
cocky with his best girl on his arm —she
wearing a brand new half-hoop and a daz-
zling Nellie Stewart bracelet as .thick as a
bit of plumber’s piping.
The Rabbi and all the Jewish Fathers sat
well to the fore at Saturday’s orchestral
concert at the Town Hall, their special
attraction being Adelaide Van Staveren, the
daughter of the Rabbi of Wellington (Maori-
land), who was singing “O Don Fatale” and
“Softly Awakes My Heart.” Adelaide is a
young woman with warm coloring, a pleas-
ing width of forehead and an indefinable
something that with the passing of years
will develop into a “presence.” Her Voice
is rich and full, with a velvety tone in the
upper register. The audience, by the way,
came as an overwhelming surprise for the
Conservatorium officials, who were bowled,
over by Saturday’s big rally. Of course,
the attraction to the suburbs was a return
of the old 35., 2s. and Is. prices. The
orchestra made the Valse Triste of Sibelius
a gentle sigh for the lost things of life, and
invested the “Blue Danube” with such glit-
tering moonlit glamor that it was not till
you were out in the night that you realised
it was rather stagey moonlight after all.
There’s going to be a record golden har-
tnf S 6l^, 111 the Sydney Town Hall on
the ni o ht of the St. Vincent’s Hospital Ball
judging trom the rate at which the tickets
are selling. Something special is promised
m the way of jazz competitions and prizes
and there s a wonderful decoration scheme
under discussion.
The Free Kindergarteners aren’t sitting
still dropping tears into the cash-box left
empty by the official ban on the yearly street
collection. They are out to make the deficit
good. Now, in addition to the tea-room at
the Conservatoriuin, they are running a lun-
cheon-room at the Education Building (the
Bridge-street lift will land you at the door)
and a tuck shop at Snow’s. Their food has
the real home-cooked flavor, and Major-
Generals Mrs. Alphen and Mrs. Wilkinson
cast a supervising eye over the commissariat
in the departmental zone.
Jean Elliott, of Bemuera, Macleay-street,
is lying a-bed at Omrah recovering as quickly
as the heat will allow from the operation
performed on her last week. She had to
come back in a hurry from her trip to Mount
Wilson to have the carving done.
There’s to be something very special in the
way of a bazaar in the grounds of St. Joseph’s
Hospital, Auburn, on March 8. Funds go to
help lighten the debt on the kindly building
that flings its doors wide to sufferers from
districts as far apart as Newtown and the
suburbs beyond Parramatta. The ambition of
the nuns is to build a special establishment
for the care of children.
On March 10, by Hugh D. Mclntosh’s
generosity, the “Lilac Domino” company is
giving a matinde in aid of the Hospice for
the Dying.
Mrs. Alphen, by the way, is getting ready
for another of her famous jumble sales in
aid of the after-care of sick soldiers, and she
will welcome with great delight any old
clothes (particularly boots or shoes) marked
“Jumble Sale” at the Red Cross Book Depot,
7 Wynyard-street.
Chryssa Criehton-Imfie, whose job in
London is to demonstrate the excellence of
Australasian products, has been giving
Maoi'iland a boost:—
Yesterday Waitrose, Ltd., invited me to go to their
big laboratory and sampling rooms. All in a row,
on seven dishes, sat seven little sample tongues, a
New Zealander among them (one had belonged to a
Chicago pig, but he was so well dressed and turned
out that in his present incarnation he looked like a
Royal Academy exhibit). After the expert had
judged, he handed the highest diploma to the tinned
sheep’s tongue from Maoriland, calling it “a delicate
and delicious meat.” Then the orders for the New
Zealand tongues began to come in. I rang up the
carrier, and he said: “Oh, I might be able to deliver
them about Jan. 10, 1921.” (It was then Dec. 15.)
So with the climate about zero I went myself to the
Victoria Docks, where I became almost submerged
in officials and red tape. At last I was allowed on
my way', got a special man with a motor-van, and
by his great favor, after nearly three hours, I had
all the goods aboard the van, was past the police
with drawn swords at the outer gates, and was
motoring to the buyers. It was worth while this
morning, when the carrying firm rang me up to say
they might, by rushing things, get the goods to the
buyers in time for the New Year, to be able to tell
them the tongues were already the chief adornment
of more than one shop window in London.
Brisbane passes on some remarks: —
Our Gov. gave a tea-party yesterday at which
pianist Teddy Cahill was the lion. George Brooke
was there, too, and the boys made music for the
guests, among whom were Mrs. Theodore, Mrs.
Macartney and her daughter-in-law, General and
Mrs. Spencer Browne, Mrs. George Sampson, Mrs.
Espie Dods and others.
W. E. Cameron, our Deputy Chief Geologist, is
going to the Fed. Malay States, to be economic and
mining geologist. Viscount Milner offered the job
before he left office. W.E. is an Ipswich Grammar-
school boy r , a graduate of Cambridge, and has been
with the Q’land Geological Survey Department for
about 25 years.
His Ex., with his entire staff in tow, arrived early
at the February Q.T.C. meeting at Eagle Farm on
Saturday. He entertained a number of folks at
tea, and filled his box with people all the after-
noon. Mrs. Jack Fihelly wandered round in a frock
of navy blue taffetas, relieved with touches of
cerise. Pretty Mrs. Jack Chandler also wore navy,
a triumph of a gown with black and white foulard
panels. Mrs. E. H. Macartney was frocked in cham-
pagne georgette, with touches of violet.
Dr. Philip Crick, Anglican bishop-designate of
Rockhampton, blew in by mail train on Tuesday
night. He seems a cheery soul, and has a good
war record. A chaplain in the early part of the
mix-up, he was with the Tank Corps in 1917, met a
lot of Aussies at the Front, and liked them. He
was dean of St. Clare College, Cambridge, is un-
married, stands 6ft. in his socks, and looks a good
muscular sort of Christian. A sister will keep
house for him.
The United Service Club gave the first “at home”
it has been guilty of last Friday. The rustle of
skirts and feminine chatter filled all the rooms,
which so far have been for “men only.” Jazzing,
afternoon tea and a programme by Harry Borradale
and some of his “Sparklers” was the entertainment
offered. The deluded soldier men made such a
success of their party that they need never hope to
be allowed go on in the old wav ever again.

Circular Saws for
Every Class of
Work.
Almost any circular saw will cut well
when it is new. The saw that proves
profitable is the one that retains its
keen cutting edge for a long time, and
then, because of the excellence of the
steel used in it, sharpens up as good
as new and will stand many re-
shai-penings.
These are the outstanding features of
every circular saw bearing
"AN EAGLE. ON A GLOBE” BRAND
Only an actual test can prove to you the superiority of “An Eagle on a Globe”
brand circular saws.
Put a sample order in to-day. You’ll find your output will increase and your
maintenance bills be much lower.

A.H.W.: Fear we can’t go mad with en-
thusiasm over the “phonetic flowing thac rhythm
rejoices” in the name “Borkookoorava”... .E.M.C.:
No use to us. .. .M.M.: “The Springaloug Family”
doesn’t strike us Joan L.: Dull rubbish N.T.
(Elsternvvick) : Nothing there.... J.H.W.: Poor stuff.
....Gladys P.: Not quite... .F.8.E.: The garden
is badly cultivated. .. .P.O’R.: “The Second Best”
isn’t. It’s not even the twenty-fifth best... .Fanny
S.: Rotten.. D.W.0.F.: “The Hut” is too machine-
made for us; but might cell elsewhere'.... Hypatia:
Why label it “Charm” ? Charm is what it
lacks A.N.F.: Don’t like it Alastor: Too
crude... .Gouper: Doesn’t make a yarn....E.C.
(North Sydney) : Your lady accountant is not inter-
esting in verse as bad as that Sodium C.: Verse
won’t do; yarn too thin and mechanical T.L.
(Dunedin): “In Memoriam” nearly R.E.8.:
“Tides of Love” goes very harshly in that wobble-
and-bump metre M.M. (Ponsonby) : Verse not
nearly up J.W. (Adelaide): That “Ivooka”
laughter doesn’t ring good S.W.S.: It isn’t a
sonnet; and it isn’t any good J.H. (Queensland):
Don’t care for “Youth” Charleville: You could
have made a story of it but you didn’t do it
J.H.8.,: It’s pretty bad verse and pretty dull matter;
so your friend loses all his bets T.M.S.: Yarn
too loose and too long Kero: On the sample, the
pen doesn’t seem your most reliable implement; but
you might do better with serious effort and a story
to te11... .C.0.0.H.: Miserable attempt... .Frederick
E.: You “dream” like a horse eating soup.... Rudall
H.: Thin verse of no quality.... Iota: Not enough
in them Topo : Very rugged Ruth H.: “A
Dream” deserves a place:—
The other night while I slumbered
And with the rest of the household numbered,
1 dreamed a dream, which seemed to be
Just in reality.
I dreamed that I died and to' Heaven did go.
“Where did you come from?” St. Peter wanted to
know.
“From ,” I replied, and Peter did stare.
“Hurry up and get in, as you’re the first one from
there.”
... .Georges E.: Turk tales well written, but not our
sort. .. . 8.M.N.Z.: “Love’s Revolt” held for inqyest.
. ...F.T.M.: “Orchids” won’t do . ...G.8.D.: “The
Intruder” ends badly Ister: Dnder any name it
would be equally futile Frank II.: “Storm” has
some good music, but that “e’er he rips” spoils
it Kuaka: Not our style.... Charles G.: The fine
opening is worth print:—
Allan Wilkie played “Hamlet” the other night at
the Theatre Royal,
And the way they treated his old man made his
blood boil.
His uncle was a crooked one: he poisoned his brother,
And when he was planted, why, he married Hamlet’s
mother.
The uncle was a bad lot; now don’t think me
disloyal.
If Billy Hughes knows this he’ll have me boiled
in oil.
They said Hamlet was mad, but he opened their eyes.
He’d got the acid on them: he was mighty wise.
.... A.M.0.5.: Poor verse. .. .F.L. (Mosman) : No
interest.... L.O. (Auckland): Mechanical sort of
“Fairyland” without a hint of imagination....
Beginner: “The Answer” is very lame. .. .S.H.G.:
“Homecoming” doesn’t get near Don Three:
“Glitter” misses Howard T.: The ballad doesn’t
thrill us N.R.C.: Thin, weak stuff... .F.L. B.:
One delicate fragment:—
The sun has set, the stars are out,
The kids have ceased to play and shout—
Have ceased to play and gone to bed;
My girl’s retired to rest her head.
The frogs are croaking very hoarse,
My girl is timid, and, of course—
Of course, she’d like to chase them away,
But thinks she’ll wait until it’s day.
Now a brown girl lies in slumber,
For the frogs have got much dumber—
Dumber now is their croaking deep,
So that my girl can go to sleep.
.... Chris T.: The sonnet is weak in form and
poor in matter H.R.M.: That picnic with minor
variations has been taking place in print for 30
years.... Loris N.: “Seaweed” is not interesting....
Birkalla: Very lumpy verse. .. .N.K. (Singapore):
None of them nearly up... .E.C.F.: “John Josiah”
is very dull, tedious and pointless G.E.M.:
“Moon” must go back J.W. (Adelaide): “Tin
Kettlin’ ” has too many bumps... .L.C.R.: Not up.
. ...A.R.C.: Station run as a military camp might
have been humorous. It is only dull and uncon-
vincing Trier: Poor stuff R.J.0.: “Billy” is
a bit crude. ... J.T.M.: We do not publish books, and
cannot possibly give opinions on book-length manu-
scripts. .. .Sourabaya: Not in our, line. . . .Gagi: We
loathe parodies T.R.H.: “Melbourne in Strike-
time” is gloomier than its subject... .Jim Crow:
Been done before....H. Murray: Ditto.... Jim G.:
Already covered L.P.8.A.: Length rules 0ut....
Chip: That parody has been worked to death....
Marvel: We do.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
B.B.: Can’t make out whether it’s a drawing or a
manuscript. .. .P.A.8.: Some promise; butjrms and
hands awful.... G.C.: Wooden... .Quiller: War gave
you the inspiration? Cruel thing, war.. ..G.C.Mc.:
Did you show it to the lady herself ?... . E.R.H.: A
“nightmare” indeed J.K.W.: Not up....J.8.:
Just misses... .J.M.: Joke old, but drawing horribly
new C.W.: Billy never deserved that.. .Aspirant :
Were you quite sober when you did them? 8.5.:
Must have sent the wrong sheet of paper. .. .Grafter:
Better stick to graft.
The main item of interest in the annual
report of Adelaide University is that last
year, being tied up for lack of funds, it
approached the Harwell Government for
another £20,000 a year (with the idea, prob-
ably, of getting a fraction of it) and got the
lot. The previous Government subsidies, on
various accounts, totalled £14.500 a year, and
these still continue. The rush of “students
has jumped the total of fees up to £lB,OOO,
and professors are now paid £llOO, to bring
them more in line with those of other uni-
versities, and kees them from temptation to
move on. (The report doesn’t put it just
that way.) The Barr Smith family gave
£ll,OOO to the library during the year, and
the Darling family is erecting a £15,000
medical buildiner. A chair of Geologv has
just been founded, and Douglas Mawson, of
Antarctic fame, is the first professor,

is so soft and luxuriant. Dandruff soon
disappears once Rexona is applied. I am

The Dark Lady.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rriHERE is a dark, dark lady who ever
goes before,
J- And each man sees and loves her and
calls on her by name;
Her favors come but seldom, and bitter is
her lore,
And no man living wins her or makes her
swift feet tame.
Yet all men follow after and tread the way
she goes,
Unheeding of the rough path and ev’ry wind
that blows.
They follow, follow after and call on her to
stay,
And ah! she throws back laughter and will
not pause for them.
They curse her and they love her, as is the
lovers’ way,
And trample rose and briar to kiss her
dress’s hem.
Most witching is this lady, most wondrous
dark and tall,
And many names they call her, these men
she holds in thrall.
For this man knows his lady is love and love’s
delight,
And fame she is to that man with laurel
for his brows;
The dreamer calls her justice and honesty
and right;
The toper hears her call him to ages-long
carouse;
The poet knows she taunts him and will not
let him be,
And sighing and calling she gives men to the
sea.
There’s gold upon her garments and jewels
in her hair
For those who crave for such things and
count their wealth each eve ;
She points the way to battle for men who
greatly dare;
She’s sleep and sweet forgetting for lonely
men who grieve—
She is all things to all men, and all men seek
her eyes;
She flings inviting kisses and tempts them
on with sighs.
So all men follow after their mistress, and
she
Goes gliding through the sunshine and
through the darkest night.
It’s little pay .she gives them whose hearts
she holds in fee,
But sweet her lips’ alluring, and round
her arms and white.
They follow, follow after and turn the wheel
of life,
Pursuing their dark lady they may not take
to wife..
And some men think they’ve won her, but
lo! her guise is new;
They only snatch a shadow and find their
lady gone.
They see her just before them, most sweet
and dear to view ;
They spring to catch her to them and
follow, follow on.
There is no pity in her, and she may not be
bound—
It is her lovers’ footfalls that make the
world go round ! I
When, by-and-bye, they falter and may not
further go,
But fall beside the wayside, she comes to
them at last
And lifts their weary heads up and smiles,
and then they know. . . .
They taste her gentle kisses, forgetting
sorrow past,
And praise their hard-won mistress with
feeble, sighing breath —
For all men win their lady to find that she
is Death!
VICTORIA.

Eternity.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DOWN at the lower end of Flaggy
Gully waterhole Thomas Barthol-
omew Barkis, stock inspector and
villain, considered that he had accomplished
the murder of Mr. Percy Peabody with com-
pleteness and discretion. The proof of his
success was extended before him. There fat
Percy lay on his back amongst the water-
rounded stones, with a wisp of damp green-
stuff round his sodden collar, a paleness of
death in his usually rubicund countenance,
and a little diluted slobber of blood about
his loose mouth. Tom Barkis head bashed
him upon the nose. Then he had leaped upon
his hack and borne him, face downwards, on
to the coastline of the waterhole. He had
held the face beneath the water until Percy
ceased to squirm and burble, and lay quite
still and limp. Then Tom had dragged him
back by the heels, turned him over and kicked
him in the ribs. He was now completely
/Satisfied that Percy Peabody was no more,
ohich to Mr. Thomas Bartholomew Barkis,
was a very satisfactory consideration.
He would now possess himself at his
leisure of slim, slant-eyed Patricia Peabody,
who w T as nearly as bad as he was, but a
good deal more attractive. In high good
humor he rode away, leaving the corpse of
Percy Peabody to fester in the sun.
The road to Pooley’s Mountain runs past
’he mouth of Flaggy Gully, where the series
of waterholes and little connecting rapids
ttat drains the Pooley Valley, and is digni-
fied with the title of river, bends in a sharp
elbow towards the low hills that come close
oown to the right bank of the stream. Along
that dusty thoroughfare the mailman to
Pooley’s Crossing, and Pooley’s Flat and
Pooley’s Swamp (old Josiah Pooley had been
the Governor Macquarie of that district
when he put his cattle on to it in 1835) used
to pass up the stream on Tuesdays and
lhursdays, and down on Wednesdays and
Fridays. A motor-car does the trip daily
nowadays, but in 1863 Billy Bourke con-
nected those outposts of civilisation with
Cobb and Co.’s coaches, as they passed
through Pooleytown on their way to Mor-
peth. Thence passengers and mails went
down the blunter by steamer, and via the
Tasman Sea to Sydney.
He was on his Friday trip into Pooley-
town when the heat of the day and the fact
that he had eaten of salt bacon for break-
fast, prompted Mr. Bourke to rein in his
horses at the Flaggy Gully waterhole in
order to get a drink. And so he became
aware of the tragedy that was really a very
bitter and sarcastic comedy.
“Glory be to Moses!” he exclaimed, when
he beheld the recumbent carcase of unfor-
tunate Mr. Percy Peabody. “An’ him lyin’
dead there! For he’s not a mahn for th’
drink. ’Tis a dead carpse he must be, th’
pore fellie. God bless us all —now what’s
happened to him?”
Mr. Peabody sat up, blinked dazedly at
Billy Bourke, and began to retch.
“ ’Tis th’ drink, then,” muttered the mail-*
man. “Get it all up, Mr. Peabody. ’Twill
be off of y’r stomich.”
When the unfortunate victim of a bad
man’s violence had emptied himself of the
great quantity of Pooley’s River that he had
swallowed, and was a little revived, the mail-
man sought to enlighten himself as to the
reason for this curious situation. He had
the news appetite of the whole river to
satisfy, and it was necessary that he should
know what was to be known.
“An’ what’s happened to ye, then, Mr.
Peabody—may I make so bould as to ask?”
The limp man on the ground struggled
weakly to his feet, and stood there, solemnly
swaying and gasping; whilst he strove to
collect his thoughts. With his handkerchief
he swabbed mud and wet water-weeds from
his peg-top pantaloons. His queer little flat-
brimmed, hard felt hat —the father of the
“bowler” —had its low crown bashed in, and
his narrow black silk tie was undone, and
straggling over his sopping shirt front. He
was very pale. His straw-colored whiskers
were wet.
“Billy,” he said, “have you room in the
buggy? Can you give me a lift to town?
Mind, I’m going to tell you nothing—so you
needn’t question me. A serious matter —
d —d serious. Best thing keep me mouth
shut. You’ll know all about it in time. Can
you give me a seat?’’
Billy Bourke looked disappointed. “Why,
certainly, Mr. Peabody,” he answered wist-
fully. “Come along, then.”
When they came to Pooleytown, Mr. Pea-
body requested the mailman to let him down
at Muldoon and Company’s. Hence, having
purchased a clean collar, a necktie and a
pocket handkerchief, his clothing being now
quite dry, he repaired to his solicitor’s.
Mr. Twopenny, the only legal light of
Pooleytown, received him with boisterous
welcome —which, however, wilted' and faded
into seriousness and concern when jLK> began
to understand that his client was in Scnne
sort of serious trouble. A single exclamation
on the part of that distressed gentleman was
sufficient to curb his exuberance.
“Fool!”
“My dear Percy!”
“Shut the door, and listen to me.”
Wonderingly, Mr. Twopenny closed the
communication between his room and that of
the office staff —a single small and squinting
boy with hair. He seated himself in his
chair, and silently regarded Mr. Peabody
with great interest and solemnity. The latter
stared at him with an almost equal porten-
tousness. For quite half a minute neither
of them had recourse to speech.
“Well,” the lawyer broke the silence,
“you’re a funny fellow, Percy. You come in
here looking as solemn as a courtesan at a
christening, call me a fool, and sit there
gaping at me like a gooney. May I ask what
such edifying conduct means?”
Mr. Peabody drew himself up, and seemed
to pull himself together. “I’ll tell you what
it means, Twopenny. It means Eternity.”
Mr. Twopenny regarded his client and
friend with increased amazement. •
“Eternity! How eternity?”
“Listen —and I’ll tell you. You know
Barkis, the stock inspector?”
“Of course I know him. Know him pretty
well. I lost three quid to him the other
evening at poker. What about him?”
“He tried to murder me this morning.”
“Murder you?”
“Yes. And he thought he had succeeded.
Tried to drown me. Did drown me —up to
a certain point. Assaulted me out there
along the river. Took me by surprise, and
knocked me out. Then he held my head
under water —until he thought I was done
for. Mailman picked me up. Brought me
into town. Here I am.”
“Good Gad!”
“You may well say so.”
Mr. Twopenny was moved by this account
of his friend’s misadventure. But something
of strangeness in the latter’s manner appealed
to him, and he looked at Mr. Peabody with
curiosity. Plainly, the good fellow w 7 as a
little unbalanced. He wbuld humor him.
“But what d’ye mean by what you’ve just
said, Percy? What’s Eternity got to do
with it? I don’t follow you.”
“I’ll tell you. It’s a revelation. Glimpse
through the veil, so to speak.”
“Oh, don’t talk d—d rot! What do you
mean by ‘veil’ and ‘revelation’? Talk
sense, can’t you? What’s it all about?”
Mr. Peabody cleared his throat nervously.
“Well, now —you listen. I think I was a
little stunned when that fellow went for me,
and”
“But hold on a minute. Why did he hit
you? You haven’t told me what he wanted
to go for you for.”
The injured man. paused for a moment,
uncertainly. Then he sighed, and went on.
“Ah. well, the fact is, Twopenny* I’d dis-
covered something. Something between my
wife and him. They—er—they’d arranged
to elope together. To clear out.”
“You don’t say so? The Devil! How’d
you find this out?”
“Opened a letter addressed to Mrs. Pea-
body. By mistake. Gave the whole show
awav. Met him on the road this morning.
Put it to him. Then he biffed me —and tried
to drown me.”
“Yes. Well —sro on.”
“Well, I think I was a little stunned after

hand which festered, and it was very sore for some time. She came to me for treat-

he landed me one, for I hardly seem to re-
member the drowning process very clearly.
I know that he jumped on me, and held my
head under water, but I don’t seem to have
made any record of the actual process of
suffocation, you know. All I remember is
thinking that I was dying, and that it didn’t
seem to be nearly such an unpleasant job
as I d always thought it must be. I have an
impression of some brief moment or two of
struggling, as it were, out of one phase into
another. Getting over the border-line, so
to speak. Then I found that I’d entered in-
to Eternity.”
“My dear fellow ! You supposed that you
had entered into the life to come?”
“Well, yes, I suppose so. Only there was
no life about it, really. Only a kind of blank
consciousness of a state of existence in which
there was no past and no future, and a sort
of knowledge of everything, and the whole
meaning of existence and life.”
“Golly! What does it mean?”
“I’m d—d if I could tell you now, but I
knew then. That extraordinary conscious-
ness seemed to leave me when I came to
again, and saw Billy Bourke looking at me.
1 lost it. But I’m quite sure I knew all
about everything then. And there was one
thing I realised then that I can still remem-
ber. It seemed to strike me as a tremendous
piece of good fortune.”
“Yes?”
“I saw the splendid joke of what - that
fellow Barkis had done.”
“A joke, you call it?”
“Yes—a joke. He’d done, himself and
Patricia the worst possible turn by killing
me. Fairly done himself in the eye—and her
too.”
“Well—but”-
“He described me in his letter to her—the
one I’d read —as a fat little bounder without
sense. You’ve no idea how bucked up I was
when I realised their status in Eternity. It
was given me to understand that fellow and
Patricia as they really are. You know, I
used to think that she was a bit extra —and
I hadn’t such a bad opinion of him, either.
But whilst I was having that peep over the
edge, I saw them for just what they are.
You’ve no idea how clearly I could size him
and her up. Wonderful. I got their measure-
to the decimal of the fraction of an inch.
Exactly.”
“And how did they shape?”
“Tim? Oh, a selfish egoist. And she is
nothing but a —well, a man doesn’t like to
make use of the term in connection with the
woman he’s married to, you understand. Just
£o. One of that sort. Common. Cheap.
'Nasty.”
“Dear me ! How distressing !”
“I could see them tied together for millions
and millions of years, for all the countless
ages of infinite Eternity, and I was able to
realise what a devil of a punishment they’d
bought for themselves. Him by murdering
me in such a treacherous fashion, and Patricia
by her faithlessness. Punishment! No-
thing that I could have imagined would have
come near it. They could realise each other
just as they were. A terrible punishment.
The egoist and the —er —the harlot. To-
gether for Eternity. Hell, old man—Hell, I
tell you!”
Mr. Twopenny was looking out the win-
dow, which commanded a view of the sloping
Main-street—white houses, willows and ver-
andahs supported upon spindly posts, with
sunlit purple mountains for a background—
and suddenly he put his fingers to his lips
and frowned at his client. He looked
startled.
“Hist!” he whispered. “By heavens, here
she is ! ’
Mr - Peabody froze in his seat. He became
as pallid as he had been when he was peeping
behind the veil at Flaggy Gully. There was
a deadly silence, that was broken by a little
timid knocking at the door. Presently it was
pushed open gently.
“May I come in?’’
Framed in the doorway against a glimpse
ot sunlight in the street without, stood a
pretty lady dressed in cool muslin that spread
itself, in the ample skirts of the ’sixties, right
across the lower half of the picture. The
top half was that of a shapely bust in a tight
and braided bodice, a face that was beauti-
ful and smiling, surmounted by a mass of
dark brown hair done up in a chignon, and
a curious little trimmed straw hat of a flat
and oval make. Blue ribbons fluttered from
it behind the shapely column of a white
throat in whose clear skin were sugges-
tions of faint blue veins. Very bright
dark eyes—in which there was, perhaps, a
suspicion of naughtiness—glanced amusedly
about the frowsy little room, with its paper-
filled pigeon-holes and lithographs of race-
horses. She nodded and smiled to Mr. Two-
penny. Of Mr. Peabody she seemed to be
studiously unaware.
“You may inform my husband, Mr. Two-
penny, that I am going away. To-night,
By the coach. I shall expect to see him
next week, at the Royal Hotel in Sydney.
Good morning.”
The two men sat and stared at one
another, dumbly, for a full minute after she
had disappeared.
* * * *
George-street in 1863 was not the roaring,
strident main artery of the big city it is
to-day.. There was a leisurely peacefulness
about it that has been missing these many
years. Hansom cabs, sociables and vic-
torias made up its more exalted traffic.
Water-carts, vans, four-horse omnibuses and
hay-waggons stood for the daily life of the
capital. Now and then a bullock-dray lum-
bered slowly towards the Quav, and' horse-
men hitched their steeds to the little hooks
that most of the wooden verandah-posts out-
side shops and public-houses sported for the
benefit of customers. There were occasional
drinking-troughs at the corners. Ladies in
crinolines—though the crinoline had already
seen its best day—and gentlemen capaciously
trousered, moved up and down the side-
walks. You saw many more top-hats than
are to be seen to-day—it was a time when
the top-hat even invaded the cricket-field.
But to Mr. Peabody, leaning unhappily
over the railing of the first balcony of the
Royal Hotel, outside the drawing-room, the
winding thoroughfare seemed a very inferno
of noise and unsightly nurry. At the door
of the hotel a swarthy Italian with one eye
performed upon a wheezy barrel-organ, upon
which a red-coated monkey sat in a bored
attitude aud quizzed by-passers contemptu-
ously. “Pop Goes the Weasel,” it played,
and then “Champagne Charlie.” The latter
was a singularly inspiriting masterpiece, but
unhappy Mr. Peabody drew little consola-
tion from its cheerful strains.
He awaited his wife. With a good deal
of perturbation, some impatience, and finally
resignation he awaited Her for 25 minutes,
At last sue came out tnrough tne big r reach
doors on to the balcony—very handsome and
stately in deep mourning, with some white
laundered stuff at throat and wrists—and
inclined her head frigidly as he turned ner-
vously to greet her.
“Will you come into the drawing-room?”
she said coldly. “There is no one there.”
Meekly Mr. Peabody followed her in and
sat down in an uncomfortable, curly-backed
armchair that was padded hideously with
horsehair, after the manner of the time,
There was an antimacassar over its back,
He found that he had nothing to say, and
awaited her opening.
Heavy curtains shut out the glare of
the summer morning that was reflected from
the houses across the street, and the big
room was dim to him at first, so that his
wife was hardly visible until he became
more accustomed to the twilight. Presently
she spoke. Mr. Peabody found himself some-
what emotional. He gulped a little in the
throat as her beauty grew more visible in
the darkness.
“You knew, of course,” she said, in that
curious contralto voice of hers that always
seemed as if it were going to break into a
sob or a laugh—“you knew' about the bush-
ranger at Chain o’ Ponds?”
“Of course, the Maitland Mercury was
full of it. I’m glad you weren’t hurt.”
She was silent a moment. Then : “I was
hurt!” she said.
“How? Why—l thought that the only
person damaged was Tom Bar—that d—d
fellow! Can’t bear his infernal name. Glad
he got his deserts, anyway.”
“You must not talk like that. He’s dead,
and I don’t think”
“Dead! Yes, by God, Patricia—he’s dead
and I’m done. Done out of the satisfac-
tion I might have had in seeing him brought
to trial and sentenced to death—maybe
hanged. Attempted murder it was. No
doubt. Tried his best to kill me. Well—
death’s saved him. He’s lucky. He ought
to welcome Ben Parker in Hell, and thank
him for what he did for him when he stuck
up the mail-coach at Chain o’ Ponds. But
‘hurt’—you—how were you hurt? The
paper mentioned only—only that d—d
fellow. What happened to you?”
She was really sobbing now, and the voice
was a little deeper. “I was hurt more than
I can say. I found that he was—he was—
a coward .”
Mr. Peabody sneered.
“Oh, indeed! You hadn’t realised that
he was one after he'd attacked an unsus-
pecting man and tried to kill him—treacher-
ously. Oh, no. Not a bit. How did you
find that out at Chain o’ Ponds?”
She dabbed at her eyes with her little lace
handkerchief.
“He went up behind Parker—the bush-
ranger—and tried to shoot him. After he’d
had his hands up. But there were no caps
on his revolver. He’d meant to get some at
Muswellbrook, but must have forgotten
Parker chased him round the coach, firing
at him—and he ran behind me. He held
me between himself and the bushranger—
and—and I could feel him trembling. He
whined for his life. Abjectly. When Parker
pulled me away he went on his knees— and
—and cried. Like a child. Till Parker shot
him dead. Through the head. Omy God!”
Mr. Peabody was not affected by her rela-
tion of this tragic circumstance. He got
up and walked twice across the room, frown-
ing and studying the wreaths of roses in
the carpet. . He halted in front of his wife,
looking down upon her, as she leaned back in
her chair regarding him with gloomy dislike,
“Now look here, Patricia, what I want
to know’s this. What are you going to do
about it? You seem to have given yourself
to this fellow pretty cheap. Well, that’s all
right. Thing’s done. Can’t be undone,
But the cow’s dead—thank God !—and no-
body except Twopenny knows anything about
it. Tom Barkis was only a passenger on
the coach you were travelling by, when it
was stuck up. Nothing to do with you—
even if he did try to hide behind your hoops,
We’ve no children to consider—and maybe
it’d be best to let you go to Hell your own
way. But I don’t like scandal. So you’d
better go back to the station—to Pooley’s
Mountain. Don’t you think so? For your
own sake, as well as mine.”
She looked up at him for a moment, and
then leaned a little forward, while her right
hand fumbled at the back of her skirts. He
went on.
“Yes, I think that’s about the on’y thing
to do. And I don’t mind telling you, I
think I’m treating you pretty handsomely,
If that fellow had lived—as I told you in
my letter last week—l meant to let you
both go to blazes in your own way. When
lie was trying to drown me at Flaggy Gully
I had a dream or something—a sort of reve-
lation of Eternity—and I realised that the
two of you, together, in this life and the
next, would be about as severe a punishment
for each of you as could be hoped for. Him
a d—d scoundrel, and you—well, you can
see what you are any time after dark in
George-street, outside here. Oh, yes, you
know what I mean. Just that. You’d have
had all Eternity to learn the truth about
one another. But he’s dead, and nobody
knows anything. So you’d better get back to
the run. See? We won’t have anything
to do with one another—of course. * But
people won’t talk.”
She stood up and faced him—very pale
and wicked-looking. There was something
about her eyes—the peculiar angle of their
setting, perhaps—that gave her that look of
wickedness when she was annoyed.
“You know, Percy, I never did like the way
you dressed. Those hats! And your idiotic
ties! You may consider that throughout
Eternity!”
She withdrew her hand from behind her
back, and poked a pistol into her husband’s
face,
“Eternity!” she croaked, as the shot
crashed and roared. “Oh, yes.”
