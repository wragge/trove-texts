have a look at our rubber plant
We have beautiful gardens at Australian Carbon Black,
but our most important “plant” is.the one you see here.
It’s a scaled down Banbury mixer, and can mix up a
“batch” of rubber exactly as a large Banbury would
for tyres, conveyor belts, anything rubber.
And that’s only the beginning. It’s what Australian
Carbon Black does with that batch next that counts.
Subjects it to a lot of standard tests . . . and some
standards so new they’re not available elsewhere.
So when.a manufacturer or compounder orders a
black from A.C.8., he -knows it’s going to meet his
exact specifications; that it will meet all performance
standards and be the most economical for his product.
Or, if it’s a new product, we’ll help formulate speci-
fications in our modern laboratories. They are for the
free use of anyone who uses carbon black in his product.
So the next time you think of black, will you think
of us.

WEEK
VISITORS
WE ARE NOT close followers of the
social scene, but Sydney hostesses must
be delighted by the number of witty
and elegant spare men available for
dinner parties this summer. Visitors
include Cecil Beaton, Lord Maugham,
Sir Robert Helpmann, and Beverley
Nichols.
WRONG NUMBER
CANBERRA’S telephone directory,
issued this month, still lists the Treasury
Department under a number obsolete
since July last. And for the second year
in succession the Treasury’s junior
agency, the Bureau of Census and
Statistics, is not listed at all: 5000 of
Canberra’s public servants isolated.
Proof of the Post Office’s antagonism
to the Treasury or of its inefficiency?
YOU NAME IT
AS WE WALKED into Bil ly
Daniels’ seventh floor eyrie at the
Chevron, Sydney, we were startled to
see photographs everywhere a
miniature gallery of shots that would
have a good chance of a prize in any
international exhibition. “You name
it,” said the star of “Golden Boy”
(with Sammy Davis Jr.), whose “Black
Magic” sold six million discs, and who
has just wound up a season at the
Silver Spade, “and I do it. Take photo-
graphs, fly planes, sail boats, chase
women —everything a man should do.
But I don’t know where all those mil-
lions went.”
He was discovered by a galaxy of
celebrities in turn: among them Howard
Hughes, who came up to him “tall,
skinny, mysterious” in a nightclub
washroom and offered him a Holly-
wood contract; Walter Winchell, who
mentioned him in his column, and
Dutch Schultz, the gangster, who
“adopted” him and cried when he
sang. He was working a club in Park
Avenue when “That Old Black Magic”
brought audiences to their feet back in
1950, and he became an international
star overnight. On the biggest night,
the club picked up 83,000 dollars.
His first appearance in Sydney was
in 1954, with two of the three Andrews
Sisters at the stadium in a storm. The
noise! “There was hail on that tin roof
and poor Lee Gordon, he just died.
He was a genius, but he was self-
destructive.”
Polly Adler used to bring all the
girls from the House that was not
a Home to hear him sing. Elsa Max-
well also took him up in a big way.
“She was fabulous. She knew everybody
and even in the men’s room. She
could get you on a plane or a train
anywhere even in Yugoslavia. But
when Lady Mendl died Elsa lost her
income, and she became bitter. She
went to people she’d given parties for
and they wouldn’t help her. One
wealthy society woman, the biggest in
New York, turned the cold shoulder on
her when she got old and sick and
needed money.”
He was a smash hit on Broadway in
“Golden Boy.” “It was directed by
Arthur Penn, who did ‘Bonnie and
Clyde.’ He made an actor out of me.
Pie’s dynamic, like a Kazan. He acted
the parts for us all. We had to re-
write the whole show 20 times out of
town. I thought, I can’t go on, but
he made me stop studying voice pro-
jection and taking acting lessons. He
told me to be myself.
“Now I may do another musical, it’s
been written for me: ‘Cadillac Charlie.’
But it’s difficult, a racial theme, and
I’m not sure if I’d want to be associ-
ated with that.
“It’s about a fellow who goes to
New York with one ambition. To get a
Cadillac. But gradually he gets caught
up in the racial thing. More and more.
And in the end it’s the story of Mal-
colm X. He’s killed at the end. I may
do it, but meanwhile —” Billy Daniels
looked a lot more sure “I’m going
to play Miami.”
TERMS OF REFERENCE
“WE DON’T WANT this to become
a political football,” John Thompson,
poet and president of the Padding-
ton Society, said after the meeting
Paddington residents held recently to
protest against the N.S.W. Department
of Main Roads’ plans to tear down
about 400 houses to send two arterial
highways slicing through the area.
Nevertheless, the issue has been very
much in evidence this week as the
candidates for Bligh in the State elec-
tions took up their combat positions.
“Save Paddington from Destruction,”
urged ALP candidate Tom Morey in
his campaign advertisements. “Support
the Local Resident Pledged to Fight for
its Preservation.”
But the prize for volubility went to
a newcomer to the lists, Independent
Peter Clyne, a lawyer turned property
dealer, who put his case in colorful
“go-go” prose in a spate of newspaper
advertisements. “Planning Gone Crazy”
read one excerpt, reinforced with three
exclamation points. “Dream Highways
and Psychedelic Schemes are getting
to cover your city like a spider’s web.
The State couldn’t pay for them in a
thousand years.
“Meanwhile, every time some plan-
ner picks up his ivory pencil in some
ivory tower, every time the Moving
Finger Writes, the shadow of resump-
tion falls on someone’s property. Next
time it may be yours.”
We finally contacted Mr. Clyne
through his newly opened Paddington
office and he told us he’d decided to
stand for election shortly after writing
his annual letter on rent control to-
the “Sydney Morning Herald.” He
had also made his views on town plan-
ning known, people had suggested he
should stand, and before he quite knew
what was happening, he did. “I think
it’s healthy for Parliament to have an
Independent. They should have one
nuisance.”
Whether he’s destined to become a
nuisance or not, Mr. Clyne has not
been slow to play the political-image
game.
In one of his advertisements he has.
announced that he is looking for “ten
beautiful girls to form a Peter Clyne
Brigade . . . No political experience
necessary. I haven’t any either. All I
want you to do- is smile at 2000 people,
hand out 2000 pamphlets (each) . . .
and on election Saturday . . . look
prettier than all those tired party
people.”
He had 25,000 pamphlets ready to
be distributed, he explained, and he
wanted the girls to talk to the voters
while they passed out the pamphlets—
or those pamphlets which weren’t ear-
marked for being thrown from roof-
tops or dropped from an aeroplane. “I
don’t think anyone’s used the aeroplane
idea since 1920,” he mused.
He is also president of an organisa-
tion called the Planning Victims’ Asso-
ciation, which he formed about three

years ago. “We had a meeting in the
North Sydney Town Hall—2ooo people
—and we all started with the best of
enthusiasm. We did all we could and
got absolutely nowhere.
“There’s nothing you can do. Pro-
perties are marked for involvement in
some planning scheme and you can’t
buy or sell them. They’re called
‘affected,’ as if they’ve got a disease or
something. Years go by and they sack
the planner or change the plan, then
they tell you they don’t want your pro-
perty any more, thank you very much.
“So the State Government has
opened this inquiry into the Paddington
proposals. Well, to me, there’s some-
thing sinister about that being promised
so suddenly at the time of the election.
“If the Commissioner finds that the
roads should not go through, the
Liberals can quite easily bury his re-
port in some wastepaper basket if
they’re re-elected.”
Architect Walter Bunning, who is
conducting the inquiry at the Sydney
Town Hall this week, has these terms
of reference —the traffic requirements
of the area; “the amenity and special
character” of Paddington; the relation-
ship between Paddington and the other
areas, particularly West Woollahra, and
“the submission of appropriate recom-
mendations to satisfactorily resolve the
issue involved.”
Last week, shortly before the inquiry
began, the State Planning Authority had
received 1800 requests for representa-
tion —some measure of the strength of
the protest. Paddington, with its wind-
ing, quiet streets, faithfully restored Vic-
torian terraced houses and proliferation
of wrought-iron lacework, is regarded
protectively and very proudly by most
Sydneysiders.
A short distance from the city and
commanding some view of the Harbor,
it has become, in the words of the
estate agents, “a highly desirable
address” for those who want to live
close to the city yet can’t take the
vertical style of life in a home unit.
The protest has been mounting,
gradually at first, then with more
momentum, for seven and a half weeks,
inspired by the efforts of the Padding-
ton Society. The society, founded in
1964, works “to preserve the unique
mid-Victorian charm of Paddington’s
terrace architecture, to hold on to the
little enough of Sydney’s early days
which remains and is worth preserv-
ing.”
It uses “persuasion through example,”
and is especially proud of one Padding-
ton street containing ten terraces with
the same kind of frontage, the owners
of which have all agreed never to
change the frontages without consulting
one another.
On December 7 last year, Miss Viva
Murphy, the society’s secretary, was
quoted as saying that the City Council
was delighted with the work of
the society “and is doing all the work
of planting trees. Inside two years we
hope to have all Paddington planted
with them.”
Then, three weeks later, at the
Paddington: restored Victorian-era
society’s Christmas party at Victoria
Barracks, the vice-president, Luke
Marsden-Smedley, injected a note of
tragedy into the proceedings with the
news of the Department of Main
Roads’ proposals. The plan is to create
a wide traffic link between New
South Head Road and Oxford Street
and to widen Jersey Road. In addi-
tion to 200 houses, the Life Line
Centre, part of the grounds of the
Supreme Court, and Rudy Komon’s
Gallery would be among the casualties.
Protest meetings were held, privately
at first, then the Paddington Society
organised a climactic gathering at the
Paddington Town Hall in mid-January.
More than 400 people were there and
the speeches were impassioned.
Mr. Norman K. Mills, chairman of
the Management Committee, said that
it is so often “typical of this kind of
proposal that it is implemented without
properly considering the human
element.
“So some inadequate form of com-
pensation in money is offered, but it
is inconceivable that responsible authori-
ties should fail to understand the mental
distress that the loss of our homes can
have on us.”
Architect and town planner George
Clarke doubted that any evidence had
been presented by any Government
department “that there is, or ever will
be, any real or essential need for these
particular new roads ... It has not
been shown that the costs of roadworks
drawn in the Planning Scheme have
ever been calculated or even estimated.
It seems possible that there is not, and
will not be for an indefinite number of
decades, available public money to
carry out these works.”
Title of the most unappreciated
speaker of the evening went to Joan
Pilone, an ex-alderman of the City
Council, whose remarks in defence
of the proposals were terminated when
the audience slow-clapped her off. It
seems most people felt the fact that
she lives at Cremorne made her opinion
rather irrelevant to the argument. Yet
one can hardly blame her. After all,
everybody else seems to be getting into
the act.

Giving play to no
end of vicious
proclivities
DEAR READER no doubt you
have heard the ugly news. As from
March 1, sport for profit on Sunday
becomes legal. All one has to do is
get a permit from the Chief Secretary,
Mr. Rylah, and pay a fee of $5.
Oh, this is disturbing news. Except
possibly for Adelaide, we always felt
that here in Melbourne we had a
higher moral tone than the rest of
the land. Indeed, in the past we have
always quoted the beautiful old lines:
Our morals continue to strike us
As something magnificent to see.
Of course, you can never be like us,
But be as like us qj you are able to be.
The Melbourne Sunday was world
famous, a tourist attraction, really, like
trams and 6 o’clock closing. Where
else on earth could you find a city
where absolutely nothing happened,
where the biggest excitement among
the citizens on a Sunday was to go
either to the Botanic Gardens or to
Essendon Airport: an alternative of
gazing in composed decorum at the
swans or in composed decorum at the
7275?
As we mentioned once before on
this page, the late Brian Fitzpatrick
used to say the Melbourne Sunday was
like the Winged Victory of Samothrace,
perfect in its beauty. Now one shudders
to think what will happen, football
unlimited, Sheffield Shield cricket, run-
ning, jumping. Why, do you realise?
they could even have dog-racing.
The thing which really made our
morals so magnificent to see was the
1780-1 Act of George 111, which was
called “an Act for Preventing Certain
Abuses and Profanations on the Lord’s
Day, Called Sunday.” It said, “. . . any
house, room or other place which shall
be opened or used for publick entertain-
ment or amusement, or for publickly
debating on any subject whatsoever,
upon any part of the Lord’s Day, and
to which persons shall be admitted by
the payment of money, shall be deemed
a disorderly house or place.”
To be honest with you, some pretty
crafty profanations have been going on
for some time. The lurk was this:
instead of selling tickets simply take
compulsory donations at the gate, and
this made it possible to slip under
George Ill’s guard. But in recent years
Olympic Park has been a constant dis-
orderly house and we even had dis-
orderly housing at such august places
as the Kooyong Tennis Club.
This is a shock, because here in Vic-
toria always we have had the most
potent Sabbatarians. Even in the early
1850 s William Kelly, an Irish writer,
told of “the air of quiet serenity and
decorousness which pervaded the capi-
tal on the sabbath morning . . . I could
almost fancy the echo of my footfall
was reproving my trespass on the pre-
vailing stillness. Even when I got into
Great Collins Street there was not a
soul astir.”
Over the years we have fought many
and great Sabbatarian battles. In 1855,
for example, with a callous indifference
the Army fired a gun salute on a Sun-
day in honor of the birthday of Prince
Albert. The Rev. Dr. Adam Cairns
wrote: “I confess my surprise gave way
to a sense of shame that the law of God
and the best feelings of His people
should have been distressed and shocked
by a disturbance for which not the
shadow of a reason can be alleged.”
Always we tried to keep the city free
of any public entertainment whatever
on Sundays, but it must be admitted a
certain Mr. Fairclough, in August, 1875,
hired the Town Hall for an evening of
sacred readings, interspersed with instru-
mental music. The Melbourne Society
for Promotion of Public Morality
thought this was just a disguise to pro-
vide entertainment, and the members
waited on the Mayor to express their
utmost indignation at the “unholy pros-
titution of a public building.”
The resulting publicity was marvel-
lous and the effect was to fill the Town
Hall to capacity. Mr. Fairclough got
away with it that time.
Then, of course, there was the
battle of the opening of institutions.
"Isn’t it wonderful! Mr. Rylah says
we can charge admission on Sundays.”

Was it right for people to go into
public gardens on a Sunday. In the
1870 s we worried terribly about the
Zoo. Finally we decided as long as
people- didn’t pay it might be all
right for them to talk to the animals,
so we made the Zoo free on Sundays.
But the wrangle over the Art Gal-
lery and Museum went on for 35
years with the Sunday Observance
League and the Sunday Liberation
Society locked in terrible battle. In
May, 1883, the trustees did actually
open the building on Sunday after-
noons, and the war was on. The
Sunday Observance League issued this
splendid manifesto: “We assert the
supreme majesty of God’s sabbath law
against its violators, nation or indi-
vidual. We will fight to the death for
Sunday for every toiler in the nation.”
The Gallery might just have got
away with it but for “Chloe.” “Chloe,”
the same “Chloe” of Young and Jack-
son’s, then owned by the surgeon Sir
Thomas Fitzgerald, was on loan to
the Gallery. John Russell, one of the
top Sabbatarians, discovered she was
there: “No decent woman with
daughters would stand in front of it.
For whose delectation is it hung there?
It may safely be said not for female
visitors and therefore it must be for
males young and old, and only for
those of vicious proclivities. No artist
has yet painted and exhibited a naked
woman naturally and probably never
will.” The controversy lasted from
May to July, and Parliament, terrified
by the onslaught, closed the Gallery
on Sundays and did not have a sabbath
opening again until 1904.
Sunday trains, top, were the cause
of fearful battles. For example, in
March, 1874, there was a railway
picnic to Macedon for 1500 people.
They all went to church first, but you
must realise on this Sunday they had
four bands and a booth “where
spirituous liquors were sold.” The
scandal very nearly brought down the
Government.
F,ven 60 years later we were still
restricting trains on Sundays, but
there was always a great moral prob-
lem for the clergy. The Methodist
“Spectator” in 1906 insisted that there
must be total abstinence from train
travelling on Sunday, even if it made
getting to church a serious problem.
In 1928 the Brighton Council very
decently banned golf at Elsternwick
Park, and as late as 1947 there was a
referendum in Camberwell and the
good citizens were asked: “Are you
in favor of non-commercialised sport
approved by Camberwell City Council
being played on municipal reserves on
Sundays?” The answer was a fairly
resounding “no”—a majority of 1771
out of 9000 votes.
But now, after this, all is ruined.
All that we have left is the honor
of being the one capital without Sun-
day newspapers. But you wait; now
anything can happen. They might even
display “Chloe” at the Gallery on Sun-
day, giving play to no end of vicious
proclivities.

A little
law-breaking by the
legal procession
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE NEW LEGAL YEAR begins,
actually, for some members of the Bar
the Old Year hardly stopped. They’ve
been working on briefs throughout the
summer vacation, because the truth of
the matter is they do really rather enjoy
it, while at the same time trying to
give the impression that they don’t.
Officially, however, the New Legal
Year begins and in St. James’ Church,
Sydney, where this Diocesan Service
starts the process off, here, at the early
hour of 9.30 a warden is having his little
joke with a junior barrister. Will he, he
asks, will he be sitting up with the
brass this morning? And transfers a
boiled sweet from one side of his
mouth to the other. Actually, no, the
barrister won’t be doing that, because
the brass in this instance is 13 Supreme
Court judges, including the Chief
Justice of New South Wales, Sir Leslie
Herron, six District Court judges, and
other legal hierarchy who are too
numerous to identify but nonetheless
radiate power. In view of this the
barrister recognises his place in the
system which, for today, is the last
row on the left, where he will hardly
see Sir Leslie in his ceremonial ermine-
trimmed red robe.
Mr. Bernard Riley, QC, is here early,
too, antennae alert for the slightest hitch
in proceedings. Well, as President of the
N.S.W. Bar Association, he’s officially
welcoming the judges, but for the
moment something is distracting his at-
tention: records for sale in the vestibule.
Each $4.50, in pale blue glossy sleeves.
Ah, Christmas songs. Recorded by St.
James’ choir. That’s all right, then.
Over the road in Phillip Street, barris-
ters are quitting chambers. Such cham-
bers. Known to taxi-drivers as the shear-
ing-shed. A legal wife is saying, en
route for Germaine Rocher’s dress show,
it’s wonderful to get out of all those
miniscule cupboards, you know, the old
days when chambers were Victorian
dark panelling and all Dickensian fusti-
ness, whose top floor, hush, was in-
habited by ladies of uncertain virtue,
but really, Dari, these modern boxes are
hell to decorate. So what some barris-
ters have done is hire the services of a
Leslie Walford or a Tom Gillies in
order to continue working in the style
to which they have become accustomed
at home. Right now they are leaving
their wall-to-walls, in one instance it is
black-and-white vinyl, their Pro Harts,
Emanuel Rafts, their chaises longues or,
alternatively, imported Swedish leather
rocking chairs, and dawdle over the
traffic lights, robes billowing and hands
clutching wigs against the wind. On this
occasion they are directed into a little
law-breaking manoeuvre across DON’T
WALK signs. By a policeman. He is a
shade embarrassed.
And now all that’s necessary to com-
plete this ceremony are the judges,
and here they come.. “Good morning,
Sir Leslie,” cries Mr. Riley, “welcome
once again to St. James’,” and Sir
Leslie smiles tiredly; well, he’s already
been through this at the 8.50 a.m.
Roman Catholic service and ahead of
him at 11.30 is another ceremony at the
Court of Appeal, where he’ll legally
declare the New Year open. They walk
in slowly. And the smell of mothballs
and camphor lingers long and strong
in the morning air.
It is 11.15 and around the corner
from St. James’ is a black-and-white
sign: BANCO COURT (COURT OF
APPEAL), BARRISTERS’ ROOM,
LADIES’ WITNESSES ROOM,
LADIES’ TOILET (unlike chambers
where women are called Women). The
lavatory seat at Banco is sprung-
weighted and a death-trap, the looking-
glass is in a hatstand behind the door,
the barristers’ room is a canteen
presided over by two big-hearted ladies,,
and the court has red cedar benches
carved deep with initials and dates.
What happened at one barrister’s pew
on the 23/5/67 that was so important?
It’s cut so deep it is white. There is
a lone clerk here saying, “Oh, yes,
Justices Herron, Sugerman, and
Holmes will be in to do a bit of busi-
ness, but not all that much.” There
are three oil paintings of late Chief
Justices hanging on the walls: Sir
James Dowling caught in debating
posture, Sir Francis Forbes posed with
papers, Sir Alfred Stephen his name
is devoured by woodworm pretends
to read. It’s funny, says the clerk,
Chief Justices seem to last longer these
days, well, they get better medical
attention, don’t they?
Very slowly, court activity begins.
Pencils and books for Sir Leslie. Water,
Scrap paper. Has anyone, a clerk wants
to know, seen the biscuits? Eight bar-
risters walk in. Laughing and back-
slapping. Flipping bibs. Three giggling
girls ogle them. At 11.40 a tipstaff
knocks and the judges shuffle in, still
glowing in ceremonial robes. “All per-
sons having business before this Honor-
able Supreme Court . . . shall be heard,
God Save the Queen,” shouts an usher.
What is heard at that precise moment
of the New Legal Year is a thunderous
rattle of teacups from the barristers’
room. The good ladies are slapping on
another brew.

Maharajah of Mewar as an island summer palace.
Maintained in its original sumptuous style, and
now air-conditioned, it's one of the world's most
beautiful hotels.
Contrast this with the Oberoi Intercontinental in
Delhi. Ultra-modern —built in 1965 to world standards.
You can stay at either place—or indeed anywhere in

Go out

New South Wales
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
THE LATE Sophie Tucker, known
as the last of the red-hot mommas,
made her first and only visit to Aus-
tralia a few years ago. I took part
in a television interview with her, and
it was a somewhat uneasy affair. Miss
Tucker, then 74, was a lively and
affable lady, but obviously in poor
health. She was invited upstairs to
the station manager’s office for refresh-
ments, but we were told she could
not climb stairs. There was general
relief when she got through the pro-
gram without mishap. It struck me
at the time that Miss Tucker was
one of those international celebrities
who put off their journey to Australia
too long.
Igor Stravinsky, who came here for
the first time at 79, seemed even more
frail than Sophie Tucker. His appear-
ance gave the impression that he was
barely ticking over, and those respon-
sible for the great man’s tour were,
I was told, genuinely worried in case
he did not survive it.
They were two of the many famous
figures who decide to visit this country
toward the sunset of their careers.
Robert Graves, 72, was another, if more
robust, example. After a few days of
being lionised he showed signs of
fatigue, and his lecture in Sydney
Town Hall was, in the opinion of many
paying customers, disappointing.
The phenomena of the aging pro-
cess are being investigated more care-
fully today than ever before this
branch of study has been dignified
with a new and efficient-sounding
name, geriatrics. Perhaps, therefore,
some attention should be paid to a
problem that confronts many senior
overseas celebrities, namely, what is
the best time to make a maiden voyage
to Australia.
Professional performers fear it may
be a mistake to come here too soon,
as the belief is still widely held abroad
that Australia is a low-prestige place
to go to. It dates from a long way
back. A character in . a Wilde play
said of another: “He will not need
neckties he is going to Australia.”
Belloc told of the punishment of a
ne’er-do-well aristocrat: “My lan-
guage fails! Go out and govern New
South Wales.” H. H. Asquith said in a
letter, after meeting the Prince of Wales
on the eve of his Australian tour: “HRH
seemed in good spirits, despite his dis-
mal destination.” Just recently, in the
television version of Evelyn Waugh’s
“Sword of Honor,” an Army Intelli-
gence officer remarked of a sub-
ordinate: “He’s in America. Been an
awful flop, as a matter of fact, from
coast to coast. We’re thinking of send-
ing him to Australia.”
Not all celebrities take this view.
The Beatles came here, profitably, at
the height of their vogue. But without
doubt iffany notables, theatrical and
otherwise, regard the Commonwealth
as Skidsville. Homer called the
Ethiopians “the farthest of men”; now
the distinction belongs to us.
First, then, the VIP should weigh
any disadvantage of the trip in status
terms (“Cecil must be slipping
he’s gone to Sydney”) against what
Australia has to offer in the way of
cash and entertainment. The money
can be good, and this country’s tourist
appeal should not be underestimated
many overseas travel agents consider
it well worth a visit by the man who
has been everywhere else.
Next I would recommend that the
celebrity have a thorough medical
check-up. Too many of the great ones
arrive here looking as if they were held
together with sticky tape. It is not just
a matter of physical fitness. The ques-
tion must be asked: has the VIP any
serious emotional problem or psychi-
atric disorder? Is he or she liable to
break down during a performance, can-
cel engagements, or hole up in a hotel
suite with a case of scotch?
Now and then a distinguished visi-
tor times the arrival to perfection. One
such was Marlene Dietrich. Though
officially 60, she was in splendid shape
and was able to delight her nostalgic
audience. Her tour was a resounding
success.
All things considered, I would say
the early 60s are the best age for a
VIP to undertake the journey to the
farthest of men. They have probably
passed their peak-earning period in
the northern hemisphere, but their
names are still well known in Aus-
tralia. Moreover, they are physically
strong enough to cope with the hos-
pitality. It is a pity when a famous
performer postpones his Australian
debut, as Maurice Chevalier did, until
he is in the 70s. Like other tourists,
the eminent should aim to travel while
they are young enough to enjoy it.


Australia is getting
some ratings
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
IT MUST HAVE BEEN irritating for
a certain kind of Australian to discover
that the latest Gallup Poll in America
placed Australia as the third most-
esteemed country in the minds of
Americans, rating, at 89 percent, one
point behind Switzerland and five
points behind Canada. The kinds of
Australians who would find this fact
hard to paste into their world view are
those who get some kind of pleasure
•out of contemplating the unimportance
of Australia in the knowledge and
imagination of other nations of the
world. Their conservatism is likely to
continue to be disappointed. Unless
Australia makes a complete mess of
itself (which would be hard to do),
people in various kinds of nations for
various reasons of their own will need
an image of Australia over the next 20
years and, if we don’t by our own
actions sustain their need, they will
probably go ahead and make up an
image of Australia, anyway, that will
suit their requirements.
At a rough guess it seems likely that
ordinary Americans need to believe
that there are other countries in the
world like their own. They are not
looking for a reflection of the Super-
power America of the Eagle, but for
a reflection of that other America
.smalltown America in which the aspir-
ations of ordinary people are treated as
a matter of great seriousness and dig-
nity. They find it in the dullness of
Canada, Switzerland, and Australia
(now that President Johnson has re-
minded them that Australia exists).
The more Australians are prepared to
“be themselves” (viz, to follow the
precepts of their native rhetoric and
to proceed with an open recognition of
what might be described as the com-
mon human-ness of humanity) the
more likely they are to fit the image
that ordinary Americans would like
them to have.
There is another matter. To some
Americans, Australia, in a highly florid
and romantic form, although a nation
of townies, seems to represent “the last
frontier.” In its crudest expression
this is the Australia of kangaroo farms
and sheep ranches, but the concept of
the frontier in the American imagin-
ation also extends beyond cowboys
into an extension of the dream that
originated in 18th-century Europe that
man could cleanse himself of old
things and acquire a new innocence.
Since things haven’t fully worked out
like that in America (nor can they
anywhere), Australia can be one of
those foreign countries intu which some
Americans can project their impos-
sible dream. In a way, Mr. Holt’s
drowning, both in its innocence and
in its simplicity, was a symbol of the
kind of Australia these Americans
wanted Australia to be.
America was the invention of
Europe and it has, for several cen-
turies, been used as a metaphor of both
Europe’s hopes and its despairs. For
this reason Australia can also come in
handy for the European imagination
— as an America that is not America,
as a nation that projects the demo-
cratic side of Europe’s aspiration with-
out challenging Europe’s sense of self-
esteem by reminding it of its lost
power or by causing it to hawk its
conscience in its role of reformed
criminal.
It is in South-East Asia, however,
and in Japan, that Australia is going
to be cast most quickly and pressingly
into an image coming from other coun-
tries’ needs, which, unlike the misty
and more slowly forming images of
North America and Europe, will be
specific and demanding, and an image
that we could break in a way that
would have an effect on our own con-
dition. This is the image of Australia
as a country contiguous to South-East
Asia and expected to play a comradely
role in that area commensurate with
its comparatively great wealth (more
prosperous than Indonesia, Singapore,
Malaysia, and the Philippines com-
bined) and perhaps also to demon-
strate not only in its external actions
but also later in its internal society
that it is not impossible to dissolve the
nightmares of race.
To say all of this is not to become
big-headed and to suggest that the
world is going to pay all that much
attention to Australia but merely to
suggest that, from the condition in
which we were a nothing in the
imagination of other people or, at the
best, a rather dreary overseas province
of England, a red blob on the maps
that used to commemorate the Euro-
pean system of world power, we are
now becoming a recognisable entity.
And to speak of the kind of images
that might be cast of us is not to
suggest that Australia’s eyes should be-
come bigger than its stomach and that
we should try to act far beyond our
power.
One might suggest, however, that we
are not yet fully extended to our
horizons of the possible and that we
might become a better nation by hav-
ing a go at it. If we attempt to do
this it is likely that, insofar as they
think of us, other nations might write
us up for a role beyond our capacity.
But it is likely to be a decent and
honorable role and to ignore it is
likely to reduce us to a crummy,
unadaptable, and, finally, effete nation.
Please refer to Mr. Gorton.
Don’t go on tut-tutting
about this boom
COMMENT
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
THERE IS NO REASON to cluck
morally about the evils of stockmarket
booms and to forecast hellfire and
burned fingers for those who have been
going hammer and tongs in the boom-
ing Australian mining market. It is
nonsense to adopt a sanctimonious
approach to the making of easy money
that is part and parcel of a boom; to
regard the stockmarket, with its quick
profits and wild speculations, as nothing
more than an elite casino, different
from proletarian gambling on the
lottery or the horses only in that the
State does not collect an adequate per-
centage of the stakemoney in taxes.
But there is a difference, and an
important one. The stockmarket boom
in mining shares is helping to provide
a great deal of money ($5O million at
the moment) to finance the develop-
ment of Australia’s natural resources
that would not otherwise be raised. If
it were not for the fantastic rise in
price of Western Mining Corporation
shares from about $2 to more than
$5O in little more than a year, the
company would now have no chance at
all of raising $45 million from the
public in the largest share issue ever
made by an Australian company and
so financing its nickel developments
without having to sell off a stake in
them to foreign investors. The same goes
for Great Boulder, another nickel stock
that is raising $3.2 million from the
public by charging $4.50 each for new
shares; its old shares could fetch only
40 cents in the market before the nickel
boom began and are now up around the
$7 mark. And so it is in the search
for oil, where Magellan is raising $.1.7
million and Alliance $1 million to keep
up Australia’s stake in a largely foreign-
dominated industry.
In addition, the boom is attracting a
great deal of foreign buying of Austra-
lian shares (while leaving control of the
companies involved well and truly in
Australia), and this is assisting our
balance of payments in the very best
way. This in itself is enough to justify

the boom. But the boom is also sup-
ported by the realities of a massive
increase in Australia’s known mineral
resources and a new eagerness to
develop them that is bringing with it
major increases in Australia’s pros-
perity and prospects.
This is not just another boom that
must inevitably burst, like the uranium
boom of 1955. True, many of the little
companies that have jumped on. the
nickel bandwagon, for instance, are
destined to fall off it with a thud. But
the foundations of the boom rest on
companies that have major proven re-
serves of minerals, metals, or oil for
which there is strong and continuing
demand, either overseas or at home.
For their shares, the boom that has
been building up in the past two years,
as the market has begun to realise the
basic changes taking place in their
prospects, could well continue for a
long time yet. Of course, there is
always the risk that suddenly Japan
may decide she no longer needs iron
ore or coal; that the world may find
some substitute for our nickel, or rutile,
or copper, or aluminium, or silver, or
uranium, or any of the other minerals
and metals backing our boom.
But this sort of risk looks pretty
small. And, anyway, there can be no
doubt about the benefits we will get
from supplying our own petrol and oil
from local production instead of having
to buy it all from overseas.
Naturally, the present boom must
inevitably come off the boil, for it is in
the nature of stockmarkets to become
over-enthusiastic about things sooner or
later. And then not only will the
vogue-ish but nevertheless “rubbish”
stocks return to their more appropriate
price levels when they fail to deliver
the goods, but the big ones with real
assets will suffer some sort of reversal
down to a more “realistic” price. But
so what. With luck this should not be
too serious.
But if these “respectable” stocks will
not bear the brunt of any reaction
against the boom, the little companies
that have jumped in price from a few
cents to several dollars purely on the
strength of untried prospects will suffer
the greatest disasters. Some of these
companies have seen their prices soar
simply because they have announced
they intend to examine a nickel pros-
pect (and some of these “prospects”
have already been rejected by the big-
leaguers after being given a pretty
thorough going-over). This, of course,
is madness. But while there is even an
outside chance that one of these
“punter’s stocks” could luckily break
into the big time and multiply mag-
nificently in price (and let’s face it,
WMC was in that category not so long
ago), then it is natural that people will
back that chance with cash.
So this is not a boom to be tut-
tutted about despite its recklessness and
its encouragement of some pretty hair-
brained projects; it is a boom that is
encouraging Australian capital into
financing the development of our own
natural resources. Let’s hope it lasts.


Dravo can design and build the nuclear power plants to light up tomorrow
Dravo Corporation, which con-
structed the world's first commer-
cial nuclear power reactor eleven
years ago, has the staff and ex-
perience necessary to design,
engineer and construct complete
power facilities—both nuclear
and fossil fueled. In fact, services
to the electric power industry
account for over two-thirds of the
engineering performed by Gibbs
& Hill, Inc., a Dravo subsidiary.
which places that firm among the
leaders in power engineering.
Gibbs & Hill's experience with
nuclear energy goes back to the
"Manhattan project" during
World War 11. Later came work
on atomic submarines and re-
search particle accelerators. In
1955, G & H designed Europe's
first operating pressurized-water
nuclear power plant. Since then,
services have been provided on
nuclear power projects valued at
more than a billion dollars, in-
cluding Europe's largest pressur-
ized-water plant near Zurich.
Dravo nuclear engineering
services include national surveys
of power potentials; technical
and economic feasibility studies;
plant design, specification and
construction ; personnel training ;
and plant start-up.
Designing nuclear and con-
ventional power facilities is but
one of Dravo's special talents.

AUSTRALIA
Hasluck showed them
the other Hasluck
WHEN HE IS in Canberra, External
Affairs Minister Paul Hasluck spends
much of his time in a dank, almost
windowless office in the basement of
Parliament House. He acts out a role
of tireless backroom-boy, the remote,
unapproachable, austere man who is
diligently working on his files. True, he
emerges occasionally to deliver a very
competent lecture in Parliament; but,
self-consciously, he avoids Press confer-
erences and television, thereby achiev-
ing almost no communication with the
Australian people.
It is a quite different man who goes
overseas as Australian Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs—relaxed, charming, and
displaying a dry wit, he takes every
opportunity to communicate, and he
even seems to enjoy it. He certainly
does it with consummate skill.
Take his just-completed visit to
Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and
Djakarta. In his private talks with
Malaysia’s Deputy Prime Minister, Tun
Razak, and Singapore’s Prime Minister,
Lee Kuan Yew, he reassured the lead-
ers of these countries that Australia,
despite its unhurried, guarded reaction
to their invitations, intends to remain a
good ally. As we reported last week, he
indicated to them the rough outline of
Australian Government thinking on the
future relationship a preparedness to
maintain a military presence “just more
than token strength,” a desire to
squeeze something, however small (like
training manpower for ground-to-air
missiles), from the British; and then
the need for replacing Anzac assistance
with a loose, flexible agreement which
continues the tradition of the current
arrangements. He “explored” their
reaction to this, and returned very com-
petent to push some much-needed
thinking into the current defence re-
view.
Most obvious, though, was Hasluck’s
skill in public communication, in suc-
cessive Press and TV interviews;
while emphasising the magnitude of
the adjustments which British with-
drawal made necessary, he managed to
project a distinctively Australian
interest in developing a relationship:
“For the past 20 years there has
been one system of security in this par-
ticular region, and now the whole of
the assumptions of that time have been
changed . . . There is a period of
four years ... to arrive at the new
security system for the region. Aus-
tralia’s history of relationships with
Malaysia and Singapore is quite dif-
ferent from Britain’s. We have to work
out our own relationships. We do not
have to take over the British relation-
ship. They are two different things . . .
our relationship is of another free and
independent country that lives as a
neighbor with Malaysia and Singapore
and faces similar dangers.”
Asked whether Australia would
withdraw forces when the last
British leave in 1971, he replied:
“Before or after 1971 is not in our
mind: 1971 is not a point of time-
ta'ble as far as we are concerned it is a
date that is significant (only) to the
British. But for the Malaysians and
ce Australians, 1971 does not terminate
anything . . .”
, , • , *
The arrangements under which Aus-
tralian and New Zealand forces are to
stay wi be the first matter to be deter-
mined. Then, accoiding to Hasluck,
Austialia will examine if there is any
opportunity for regional co-operation
and nations of the region getting to-
gether on a non-aggression pact or on
(new) regional security arrangements.
. a completely unreported passage
in his Kuala Lumpur Press conference,
he made a reference to the Australian
Government s interest in a military
treaty broader than SEATO: If there
is something in the future that might
succeed SEATO, we would certainly be
interested in that.
He implied that Australia would
welcome an invitation to join ASEAN,
the Malaysia - Singapore - Indonesia-
Philippines-! hailand association, though
it wasn’t diplomatic to ask openly, said
Hasluck; “a modest maiden always
waits until she is asked.”
Hasluck seems destined to take on
an enlarged role in forming Australian
foreign policy in the new Government.
Under Mr. Holt, he seemed at times
to dwindle into little more than an
External Affairs Department official,
while the Prime Minister set the tone,
made the speeches, and answered the
questions. Mr. Gorton’s first plunge
into foreign affairs was an inept be-
ginning. It is an elementary rule in
public affairs that you do not close
off any more options than you have
to, for there is nothing more damaging
than to have to eat your own words.
Therefore, in seeming to rule out for
all time any expansion of the Austra-
lian contribution to Vietnam or a con-
tribution to the United Nations force
in Korea, Gorton put himself in a
vulnerable position. If, as the Aus-
tralian Government has said for two
decades, the containment of Communist
military ambitions is one of the essen-
tials of our foreign policy, then no
exact limit can possibly be put on
the number of battalions we are pre-
pared to commit.
Hasluck in Singapore might almost
have been speaking for the rest of the
Cabinet and reading a lesson to Gor-
ton when he spoke these sentences:
“Anyone is distinctly foolish who starts
prescribing single prescriptions for every
possible eventuality. You have to sail
your boat according to the wind and
the water you meet, and for anyone
to lay down and say no, this is the
single prescription for what you do in
all circumstances, regardless of what
changes may take place in the mean-
time, is to my mind not realistic.”
But on arriving back in Australia,
Hasluck returned to his old native ways.
At Perth Airport he read the text of
a prepared statement to waiting
journalists. He is holding no Press
conference to be questioned or to give
publicity in Australia to his mission.

The Prime Minister
What was John Gorton up to?
AS THE NATION’S old ladies were
debating whether the Prime Minister of
Australia should be photographed with
his shirt unbuttoned down to the navel,
some other parts of the nation were
debating last week what Mr. Gorton
was up to (or whether he was up to
anything) with the nation’s foreign
policy.
In the first place he had said, off-
hand, that Australia “could not fill the
gap” left by Britain in Malaysia and
Singapore. The Singapore-Malaysia
newspapers immediately gave Mr.
Gorton’s statement front-page head-
PM Gorton... freer communication
lines. But no one knew what his
statement was supposed to mean. When
External Affairs Minister Hasluck
then visited Singapore and Malaysia,
Mr. Gorton’s statement seemed to mean
much less than had been feared.
Then, in a Press conference, Mr.
Gorton said that Australia would not
commit any more troops to Vietnam.
This statement caused such an immedi-
ately hostile reaction within parts of
the administration that when Mr.
Gorton again appeared in public—in
the Sydney Town Hall, to help kick
off the N.S.W. election campaign—he
read out a prepared statement on Viet-
nam, to qualify what he had already
said. Then he went “into smoke,”
reputedly at a N.S.W. coastal holiday
resort and reputedly with a host who
was expected to disagree with him on
this issue.
His reputation as an off-the-cuff
diplomacy phrasemaker so quickly
established, Mr. Gorton was immedi-
ately dubbed by one wit as “the
Sihanouk of the South Seas.” But the
debate continued: what was in his
mind?
• Was Mr. Gorton fundamentally un-
interested in South-East Asia and in
that respect like Sir Robert Menzies,
although less conscious of a great and
powerful ally than Sir Robert?
• Was he trying to sort out a policy
of his own, removed from past con-
cerns, extending beyond the idea of
merely “filling gaps” 'left by the
British, and perhaps concentrating more
on a friendship with Indonesia as the
fundamental basis of Australian foreign
policy? If this were so, since friendship
with Indonesia demands economic aid,
why had he stressed Australia’s concern
for its own “national development”?
• Was his talk of “national develop-
ment” a cloak for a plan to give Aus-
tralia a nuclear capacity, so that it
would have the later option of manu-
facturing nuclear weapons? If this is
so, will Australia sign this year’s nuclear
non-proliferation treaty?
• Or was talk of “national develop-
ment” the expression of a belief that
Australia could just go ahead in an
isolationist way without paying any
particular attention to its geo-political
environment? Did he really believe
that Australia was not strong enough
to do anything?
• Had he decided on a “Fortress
Australia” policy? If he had, how could
he account for his proclaimed limit on
Australia’s defence expansion? Did he
want a fortress without forts?
• Or was he just opening his mouth
where other Ministers feared to tread?
Gone “into smoke,” the Prime
Minister left these matters for other
people to talk about. But there was in
Canberra speculation about his future
actions when, having won the Higgins
by-election and having announced his
new Cabinet, he would end his present
honeymoon of power and get down to
the intractabilities of the political
situation.
He would have a Cabinet to face up
to which would not lightly chuck away
the previous trends of Australian foreign
policy. His External Affairs Minister
has already, in his visit to Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur, and Djakarta, outlined
some of the possible future shape of
that policy. And in the background
there were the Americans, who have
not concealed their desire for Australia
to play a role of its own in the ASEAN
area. There were also the dark con-
siderations of politics: how could Mr.
Gorton set a cat among the Labor
Party’s pigeons at the next election if
he fought the election against Mr.
Whitlam on the rhetoric of “national
development”?
However, before he went “into
smoke,” Mr. Gorton at least set a cat
among Canberra’s pigeons by suggesting
a changed attitude to publicity. Address-
ing the Fourth Summer School of Pro-
fessional Journalism, he began with
what is by now a traditional tilt at the
Press. “There are some papers which,
of course, one would not dare to name,
but there are some papers which oc-
casionally tend to be verging on the
uncontrolled, .particularly when they
make the best of both worlds by taking
a high moral line on how extremely
bad vice and violence and things of
that kind are, and in order to drive
home the point of how bad they are
they fill half their pages with careful
reporting of the particular things.”
He told the 110 journalists and
public-relations people present: .. .
There is a responsibility on journalists
and on the owners of newspapers and
on the editors of newspapers, and not
particularly, but also on those who
write the headlines for stories and
cut out the middle of the story there
is a responsibility on them to see that
the information is properly presented
in a balanced way.”
Then he moved to his interpretation
of the Government’s responsibility
“I believe that Governments ought
never to seek to suppress news or in-
formation, whether those Governments
feel it is for the moment to their
advantage to do it, or not to their ad-
vantage to do it. I not only believe that
this is useful to enable free communica-
tion to function, but I believe it is a
sensible policy and one which is to the
advantage of the Government \yhich
uses it.”
Government PR men present at the
address were quick to pass Gorton’s
words back through the corridors of
power, where they were received with
disbelief by some and relief by others.
There is little doubt that in future,
although the Press will finally have to
get the official version from the top,
there will be more leads coming from
the administration.
But what the nation was waiting for
was a lead from the Prime Minister
as to what his foreign policy was
about.
The Opposition
The night phrase,
the wrong numbers
JUST LIKE ANYONE else coming
back from a delightful trip overseas to
find the same old stuff going on at
home, when Opposition Leader Gough
Whitlam returned to Australia from
his six-week Asian tour he found him-
self harassed by the same old Labor
Party. It was the start of the familiar
round of State party conventions and


Keeffe ... unpopular but a winner
conferences. At the Queensland con-
ference on the Gold Coast, appropri-
ately opened by girls in the folk cos-
tume of the region, the powers that be
in that part of the Labor world showed
utter contempt for the national leader
and his programs for getting Labor into
power in 1969.
The Whitlam-Wyndham scheme for
party reorganisation was wiped off the
agenda with hardly a word in its sup-
port. The tired and ineffectual Aus-
tralian Workers Union demonstrated
its complete lack of influence in the
Queensland branch of the Party when
it put up its State Secretary, Mr. E.
Williams, as a Queensland member of
the Federal Labor Executive only to
have him defeated by the highly un-
popular Senator Keeffe. The defeat
was an overwhelming 93 to 48.
This leaves the Queensland repre-
sentation on Labor’s top policymaking
body impeccably Left-wing and implac-
ably anti-Whitlam. Williams could not
even make the six-man Federal con-
ference team, and he was eliminated
in the vote for the 16-strong
Queensland central executive into
the bargain. Despite the fact that
the AWU has as many members as
all other unions in Queensland put
together and despite the open support
of Mr. Whitlam and other moderates,
it was unable to drum up the votes
in the Labor Party to get a single
representative on a single policymaking
body in Queensland.
Western Australia saw a similar play
acted out, the moderates showing no
fight whatever. Mr. Kim Beazley, prob-
ably the party’s most intelligent repre-
sentative, stood against the Leftists for
a position at the Federal executive but
lost hands down. The same old Left-
wing machinemen—the aging Mr. Joe
Chamberlain and Mr. Harry Webb—
represent W.A. once again. For
Beazley organised support is “unbecom-
ing” but, waiting for support to come
down from heaven, he again finds him-
self with none.
Only Tasmania provided Mr. Whit-
lam with a welcome. There the Labor
Party machine’s most able Right-
wfinger, Mr. Bill Harradine, got him-
self elected to the Federal executive in
place of a Waterside Workers official.
Tasmania has generally voted “right”
anyway, in divisions in the Party but
Harradine is a far more articulate
Whitlamite than either of the State’s
two previous representatives. So his
election is a definite win for Whitlam.
It was in the more congenial political
atmosphere of Tasmania that the Par-
liamentary Leader expressed his dis-
like of the Vietnam ultimatum formula
laid down as Labor Party policy at
Adelaide last July. It was “too in-
flexible to allow for a change in cir-
cumstances in the war,” he said. It
had made it “difficult for me and
my colleagues during both the Senate
election and in Parliament to draw
attention to what the Government
ought to be doing about ending the
war. We ought to have learned that
it is unfruitful to dot every I and cross
every T in advance.”
Mr. Whitlam had again demon-
strated his ability to coin the right
phrase and his inability to get the
right numbers.
Diplomacy
Unfreezing
Cambodia
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS is looking for-
ward to the visit of Cambodian Foreign
Minister Prince Norodom Phurissara,
hoping that a full restoration of friendly
relations with his country will be
cemented. The Prince, a second cousin
of the Head of State, obviously leaves
most policy-making to the all-powerful
Sihanouk, but his importance as an
envoy was demonstrated in his recent
visit to Hanoi. He comes to Australia
at the end of this month (the exact
date depending on his choice of com-
mercial flights) for a stay of about 10
days.
Diplomatic relations with Cambodia
were strained in September last, when
the volatile Sihanouk summoned home
his Canberra Embassy staff, after Ex-
ternal Affairs Minister Hasluck had
mildly rebuked the Ambassador for
helping Monash students send money
to the Viet Cong. Whether this
precipitated the crisis is not known. It
was an incident superimposed ort# a
dispute over Australian recognition of
Cambodian frontiers. Australia had
agreed to “respect” them, but in
deference to its Thai and Vietnamese
allies, who dispute with Cambodia cer-
tain of its border claims, Australia re-
fused to go as far as to “recognise”
them.
Prince Sihanouk produced a familiar
weapon in diplomatic warfare a
“freezing” of diplomatic relations
and with it he threatened countries
which did not recognise Cambodian
borders to his satisfaction.
The Monash students’ incident oc-
curred before the deadline for border
recognition, but it was assumed at the
time that in withdrawing his Embassy
staff Sihanouk was giving Australia the
“freeze.” In fact, he never quite did.
His freeze was supposed to consist of a
withdrawal of the Cambodian Embassy,
and ostracism for the offending coun-
try’s Ambassador in Cambodia’s capital,
Phnom Penh: “No self-respecting
Khmer would have anything to do with
him,” Sihanouk declared.
But while most of the staff of the
Cambodian Embassy went home with
the Ambassador, the Embassy was not
formally closed. One officer w'as left,
with the unusual title of attache. In
Phnom Penh the Australian Ambassa-
dor, Mr. Noel Deschamps, was far from
being ostracised, and seemed to remain
on as good terms as ever with Prince
Sihanouk. The Australian Embassy in
Cambodia remained as busy as before,
doing a great deal of diplomatic a»d
consular work for the Americans, whom
it represents, and passing messages to
Saigon, where Australia represents the
Cambodians. Diplomatic relations were
not so much frozen as half-cooled and
that only at the relatively unimportant
Canberra end.
Foreign Minister Phurissara’s visit
is taken as a gesture of goodwill by
Sihanouk, and an opportunity to warm
relations to their previously friendly
temperature. The border recognitions
dispute may perhaps also be cooler.
Prince Sihanouk recently accepted
statements from Germany, Japan, and
Britain which followed the Australian
formula of respect but not recognition.

Courtis is one of four candidates in

the Lower House.
Except for Courtis, it all seemed to
be a dull and routine affair. The DLP
is standing no candidate (although after
Mr. Gorton’s “No more troops to Viet-

ting this); the ALP was also reluctant,
mainly because its Victorian branch
hasn’t got much money.
They finally selected Mr. D. Bennett,

said to be a candidate acceptable to
Mr. Whitlam; Liberal Reform has its
candidate, Dr. Weber. Higgins has
always been easily held by the Liberals.
At first Mr. Courtis’ only connection
with this event seemed to be his claim
that he once threw Mr. Gorton a life-
jacket when the ship Derrymore was
torpedoed during World War 11. But
the more immediate cause was what
happened to Courtis last month:
his application to start up a mail-
order book centre selling Australiana
from his historic property near Coff’s
Harbor was refused by the Australian
Book Trading Advisory Council. Mr.
Courtis sees this as a restriction on free
enterprise (“our freedoms are being
whittled away”), and he is standing as
a personal protest against this: “I
couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do
this,” he said. (He recalls an earlier
experience, when, as a boy in Adelaide
during the depression, he started a door-
to-door grocery business but was
stopped by the other grocers in the
town.)
Though, in keeping with his nation-
alism, Courtis is interested in pro-
moting free enterprise, justice for the
aged, an Australian shipping line, and
the conservation of natural resources
and water (“city people just don’t know
about the drought”), he is particularly
moved about Australia’s relations with
the rest of the world. Affected by his
experiences as a war correspondent in
Korea, out of which he evolved his
slogan “The cry of a starving child
should awaken every mother in the
world,” he is alarmed, by the priority
Mr. Gorton has given to domestic
affairs. He believes that if Australia
doesn’t use its resources and techno-
logical know-how to feed and assist
Asia it is likely to have itself taken over,
if not by invasion, then by the United
Nations! “We say we are Christians.
If we are to be really a Christian nation,
then we should get out and help them.
If not, then we should stop being
hypocrites, and so we’ll fill up our
bellies and let the others go.”
During his campaign Courtis has
been refused permission to spruik
from a tent in a Malvern park: so now,
like his hero Simpson of World War I,
he has now taken to going around on a
donkey.
His bike ride from Adelaide to
Sydney in 1961 should have been a
good preparation for this. “I don’t by
this imply that the people are donkeys
or that this is a donkey electorate,”
says Mr. Courtis. “I want people to
look at the donkey and ask themselves
‘Am I a donkey?’ and to think about
it.”
A member of that dying race, the
genuine Australian grass-roots popu-
larist, he says “I have spoken to over
300 people since I arrived. It’s been
an eye-opener to me, and a privilege
Courtis... grassroots popularist
to meet them. I want to find out what
the 42,000 voters are thinking and
worried about. I think that all the
candidates should meet them personally.
It’s the only way and that’s what I’m
trying to do. And I hope to take my
donkey with me to Canberra to repre-
sent them.”

"Great concern"
THE ACCOUNTANTS are still get-

the company crashes of the early 19605.
Last week’s jailing of the two Cattell
brothers over false prospectuses issued
for Latec Investments Ltd. from 1955
to 1960 was significant not only for
the warning to other company directors
not to ignore the realities of bad
debts in stating what turn out to be
phony profits, but also for strong
criticisms by Mr. Justice R. L. Taylor
of the standards of the firms of
chartered accountants that looked after
Latec’s books.
In expressing “great concern” that
the accounts of a large financial in-
stitution could be publicly audited and
yet be completely misleading, the
judge suggested it should be a statu-

tory requirement for hire-purchase

debts more than six months in arrears.
The auditor, a smallish Newcastle
firm that depended heavily for its in-
come on the Latec job, “fell lament-
ably short of the standards of probity
and honesty required of public accoun-
tants in this city,” said the judge. If
the investigating accountants who cer-
tified the profits for the years 1955-60
in the prospectus were aware that
no proper provision had been made
for bad and doubtful debts, then “the
report of the investigating accountants
is a falsity”; if they were not aware,
and did not conduct such an investiga-
tion, equally it is a falsity, said the
judge, for their report implied they
had done a complete investigation of
the whole of the affairs of the company
and had satisfied themselves as to these
profits.
The accountancy profession has been
at pains to make sure that its stan-
dards have improved since the days
when the slipshod practices attacked
by the judge seemed a commonplace,
the number of times auditors have
been severely rebuked in judicial re-
marks and official inquiries into some of
the companies that have collapsed in
recent years has been a powerful stimu-
lus to the profession to smarten itself
up. But there are still no universally
accepted definitions of profit, or bad
debts, or any of the other things that
auditors still certify as giving a “true
and fair” view of a company’s position.
What one auditor certifies to be a
“profit” may not meet the require-
ments of another.
The conviction of the Cattell
brothers, R. A. and C. L., Latec’s
former joint managing directors, adds
two more names to a growing list of
boom-time public company directors
sentenced to jail terms for misleading
or deceiving the public. International
Vending Machines’ two Steens, father
and son, last year got five years for
their “conspiracy to defraud” the pub-
lic; Stanley Korman got six months;
R. L. Borg, of Reid Murray, got nine
years, R. C. Moulton, who ran 16
companies, got two years, among
others. And there are charges still
pending over several more, including
some directors of Neon Signs and H. G.
Palmer.
For what it is worth to those who
lost money in Latec, the judge decided
that the Cattells had not misled the
public for personal gain, but in an
endeavor to keep the company going
and so “trade-out” of its difficulties. “I
doubt if either of you had the ability
to conduct such an operation; certainly
you did not have the integrity to face
reality,” he said. But at least the Cat-
tells did one thing for Australia; Latec’s
“success” prompted many overseas
(particularly British) investors to buy
its shares at high prices or to contri-
bute large amounts of capital, much of
which has been lost, so providing capital
inflow to the Australian balance of pay-
ments without the need to service it.




The creative vision of Europort
By NOEL MOSTERT
TPIE NEW EUROPE, the commercial
colossus that is slowly assuming form
despite the bitter wrangles inside the
community headquarters in Brussels,
has found its symbol in Europort, the
vast shipping and industrial complex
that the Dutch have built at Rotter-
dam, where the Rhine flows into the
North Sea.
They decided eight years ago to
build the biggest port in the world,
and they have. The decision was taken
by the Rotterdam municipality, which
put up the initial budget of $250 million
for reclamation, drainage, and the con-
struction of wharves and basins
throughout the 27-mile-long course of
marshland and tidal flats that stretched
beside the river between the old Rotter-
dam port and the North Sea. The
Dutch Government backed the muni-
cipality by revamping the road and
rail communications that link the port
with the continental hinterland.
Rotterdam’s decision to make itself
a port all the way from the city to the
North Sea was in line with the city
fathers’ recognition that existing facili-
ties were not sufficient to meet the
competition of its European rivals. The
concept that finally emerged, however,
was so ambitious that the national
Government, though sympathetic and
approving in principle, was slow to
commit itself. Rotterdam eventually
went ahead on its own, a policy of in-
dependence it has continued. When
an expensive new tunnel under the
river became an urgent necessity re-
cently and The Hague once more was
hesitant about helping, Rotterdam did
the job.
Europort’s success has been spectacu-
lar. It must be by far the single biggest
European industrial enterprise since the
war. Nothing else can equal it in size
and potential. Rotterdam’s traffic has
risen from 70.6 million tons in 1959 to
130.4 million tons. (New York, which
for years stood unassailably first among
the world’s ports, handles just over
100 million tons. London, with 59
million tons, is behind Marseilles and
Antwerp.) It is the greatest transit
port ever known, Europe’s principal
oil, grain, and ore terminal. Upon the
thousands of acres reclaimed from the
sea, brilliantly planned sites are draw-
ing the heaviest new concentration of
industry anywhere today. It is the
renting of these, and of the basins and
wharves and facilities built in their
midst, which provides the principal
revenues of the port and which has
allowed Rotterdam to mark another
$250 million for expansion during the
next five years.
All this has been achieved by what
is, in effect, a department of the Rot-
terdam municipality. Europort’s manag-
ing director, Frans Posthuma, is a muni-
cipal employee, reporting to the burgo-
master and the city councillors, who
give him virtually a free hand. If
Europort carries the mark of any one
man, then it is Posthuma’s. He and his
small team of economists and harbor
experts have been responsible for Euro-
Rotterdam, photographed from the Eurotower showing the new roads linking the
new port with the city
Frans Posthuma, the man who made
Europort
port’s fortunes since the project opened
officially in the spring of 1961.
Oil forms the base of Europort’s pros-
perity. Without it, Europort would be
swiftly reduced in rank. The fact that
the oil has flowed here in such quantity
was the result of superb timing. When
the question of revitalising the port of
Rotterdam was under discussion in the
early 19505, Europe’s expanding energy
needs made it seem an obvious course
to concentrate heavily on bulk cargo,
and particularly oil. The 1956 Suez
crisis confirmed the wisdom of the
decision.
The major oil companies themselves
were embarked upon new policies to
lessen their dependence on the canal.
By the time the first plans for Europort
were approved by the Rotterdam muni-
cipality on November 28, 1957, the size
of oil tankers on order had begun to
expand. The ships needed a discharge
point which would enable them to turn
around quickly, which would be close
to the main market areas for their
cargoes, and which would have room
for development of oil’s diverse in-
dustrial alliances in petro-chemicals.
Europort met all these qualifications.
Shell laid plans for the biggest refinery
in Europe at the port, and the other oil
companies followed. The chemical com-
bines ICI, Dow, Du Pont rented
Europort sites and laid down millions of
dollars’ worth of plant. Shell’s invest-
ment alone is estimated at $2BO million.
Pipelines extended to other European
points, and one is now even planned
to Europort’s closest and nearest com-
petitor, Antwerp.
In a way, Europort must be con-
sidered one of the major results of the
Common Market so far. One of the
factors accounting for its success is the
minimum formality required between
the six partners, allowing them to use
the port freely, almost with a sense of
domestic access. Rotterdam has always
been the obvious port for quick over-
land connection to the Ruhr and the
whole European industrial heartland.
Its Common Market character is re-
flected by the fact that over 50 percent
of its business is transit. The role is
propitious, since the Dutch are cer-
tainly the most thoroughgoing Euro-
peans of all. It was inevitable that their
solutions for themselves would be Euro-
pean in the very broadest sense.
The war had left the Dutch pros-
trate. Their sufferings, from devasta-
tion and through sheer physical hard-
ship, were greater than those of any
of the other Western European allies.
Their overseas empire, which had
earned them fat returns, was going or
gone. Something extraordinary was re-
quired, not only to reform the country’s
economy, which had had no industrial
base to speak of before the war, but
simply to create room for all its people.
The Netherlands is the most densely
populated country in the world. Nearly
12| million Dutch occupy 13,000 square
miles, and it is estimated that their
numbers will increase to 20 million by
the year 2000. The empire once helped
absorb excess population, but the migra-
tion was reversed at the end of the
war when the expatriate Dutch and
thousands of Eurasians and Indonesians
chose Europe rather than life under
Sukarno.
To help compensate for the loss of
the empire, the Dutch knew it was
paramount that they win as many as
possible of the economic prizes offered
by the advent of the Common Market.
As they have done for centuries, the
Dutch, most of whom live either at sea
level or below it, decided to get the
land they needed from the water
that is, to replace the empire they had
lost with another taken from the North
Sea.
Europort thus very soon became the
symbolic scheme linking these ideas on
Holland’s role in Europe with the need
for reclamation. As one Rotterdammer
said, “Europort is now a national state
of mind.” It has become the corner-
stone of a much wider, infinitely
ambitious plan that eventually will ex-
tend the Europort pattern of develop-
ment right to the Belgian frontier. Euro-
port, in fact, has simply become the
bridging name in the title of the over-
all project known as the Rotterdam-
Europort-Delta Scheme. In simple
terms the plan is to take north-west
Europe’s biggest estuary area, the
75-kilometre-wide basin of lakes, deltas,
marshland, islands, mud flats, and
farmland into which the Rhine, Maas,
and Scheldt flow and which extends
The symbol of Europort, the tower
which is used to control shipping enter-
ing the new port
from the Hook of Holland to the
mouth of the Scheldt at Vlissingen, and
create from it one vast harbor-industrial
province.
It is assumed, though through inter-
national delicacy not explicitly stated,
that in time and with the achievement
of the Europe of which Europort is the
forerunner, Antwerp itself will become
merely the southern limit of this opera-
tion. When that day comes, some new
sort of supra-Europort authority will be
necessary. But meanwhile, Europort is
already establishing the new forms of
co-ordination and co-operation that will
obviously provide the key to Delta’s
success.
The immediate phases of this giant
complex, when completed in 1980, will
have extended the country’s size by
nearly a seventh. The price for de-
velopment and reclamation on such a
scale, so far borne entirely by the
Dutch, is the most crushing taxation in
the Western Hemisphere. Yet the Dutch
have shown themselves more than will-
ing to pay. On every level there has
been remarkable co-operation between
the various groups involved, right down
to the key man in the enterprise, the
docker. Rotterdam has had no organ-
ised strike or significant labor unrest
since the war.
The lesson has not been lost on the
British, whose own repeated port-
paralysing strikes have been a major
factor in bringing the country close
to economic collapse and who now see
much of their traditional business going
to Europort. Even some commodities
passing from Commonwealth countries
to Britain are shipped through Euro-
port.
As one Europort official said, draw-
ing the obvious comparison with
Britain, the attitude of the dockers here
is different. A sociologist advises on
their attitudes and requirements. They
draw a good minimum wage whether
they work or not. They also draw mini-
mum equipment overalls, shoes,
safety spectacles—free. They have ex-
cellent canteen and clean-up facilities.
But the biggest difference of all is that
the Dutch have given stevedoring a cer-
tain status.
Europort has established a unique
system of training. There are two
dockers’ schools—each with a full-size
replica of a merchant ship’s decks,
holds, sides, and cargo-handling gear.
Boys (close to 1000 are currently in
training) go in at the age of 12 and
serve an apprenticeship while continu-
Below: Holland reclaims more land from the sea. Sand dredged from the new
harbor is used to raise the level of the industrial sites


ing their regular schooling. They
graduate with a professional knowledge
of their country’s commerce, its im-
portance, and its handling, not to speak
of some pride and sense of responsibility
for their role in it.
A few years ago 80 percent of Euro-
port’s labor was untrained, but with-
in five years 80 percent of it will have
received expert training. The schools
are probably the most astute invest-
ment in the entire project, and must
certainly have been a major psycho-
logical factor in maintaining peace on
the Rotterdam waterfront.
Europort’s efficiency has drawn im-
pressive results. An American factory
producing carbon black in Italy found
it cheaper to export to Israel through
Europort than through its nearest
Italian port. A Los Angeles factory
that had shipped a bulk cargo to Euro-
pean ports in sacks decided to ship
it unsacked to Rotterdam and then
distribute from here. Shipment charges
dropped from $8 to $1 a ton. “Here
the goods don’t wait and there’s no
damage in the sheds,” managing
director Posthuma told me in an inter-
view at Rotterdam City Hall.
The reason that it is, for example,
cheaper to send Australian ore to
Britain via Rotterdam is that Euro-
port can handle big bulk cargoes more
speedily than most other points, and
bulk means charges saved compared
with shipping in smaller packages in
smaller, slower vessels. These facilities
already have affected the size of ore
ships, which have grown in propor-
tion to the ability to handle them.
Europort’s ore terminal prompted Ger-
man ore interests to lay down 100,000-
tonners. As with tankers, the escala-
tion, once started, just went on. Plans
are now being made for 200,000-ton
ore carriers.
Posthuma’s grand design is to have
shipping and industry as nearly com-
plementary as possible. Oil illustrates the
sort of natural industrial cycle he wants
—crude oil into refinery, distillation of
the lighter fuels, export of crude (“We
should be able to provide for the heavier
demand of an extra-heavy winter in,
say, Norway”), and, alongside this, the
endless diversity of the by-products:
fertilisers, nylons, and multiple plastics,
synthetic rubbers, etc.
Posthuma wants the primary indus-
tries at the water, so that the raw mat-
erials will feed straight into their fur-
naces or tanks. Backing these, and sus-
tained by them, will be the manufactur-
ing industries, so that the Rotterdam-
Europort - Delta development will
radiate inland on a logically inter-
related basi. like ripples from the
same industrial splash.
Posthuma is adamant about not giv-
ing choice deep-water sites to those who
don’t necessarily require them and could
just as well be inland. He turned down
a major European motor-vehicle firm
when it asked for one of the choicer
close-to-water Europort sites, but it
accepted his alternative suggestion and
went back from the shore.
Du Pont wanted to come to Rotter-
dam, but it, too, accepted his recommen-
dation that a site south of the city
would be better for their purposes.
Similarly, a large site has been allocated
to Dow in the southern part of the
Delta. But ICI, dependent on the re-
fineries, is at the water.
Aside from such co-ordination, pri-
vate enterprise is given a completely
free hand in the port. Companies such
as Shell rent their huge sites from the
municipality of Rotterdam and then
develop them as they choose, often pro-
viding their own harbor services. Major
expansions of the port’s activities are
sometimes undertaken on the initiative
of a private firm rather than of Euro-
port itself. The huge new container ter-
minal to be used by a consortium of
major Atlantic shipowners was proposed
by a group that includes as main part-
ners the five stevedoring firms that
handle all of Europort’s cargo. Rotter-
dam speeded the reclamation for this
venture and developed the site. The
group then signed a long lease and itself
built the terminal.
All this simply means that Posthuma’s
staff operates like a large industrial
rental agency rather than like modern
harbormasters. It is left to the lessees
to acquire or hire sheds, cranes, tugs,
floating docks, ferries, and so on from
others. Posthuma has taken Europort
out of all such activities, his function
being to retain the unifying thread of
all these. “We want to be light and
unencumbered,” Posthuma told me. “I
keep my staff small so that we can work
quickly and as a team. We haven’t the
time to leave our planning to study
groups of 20 to 30 people who will in-
vestigate for years and then issue a re-
port —whose material will be out of
date anyway by the time they have
finished, so that one would only have
to start all over again. We have an
economic research program and various
crash study programs, but we ourselves
have to anticipate developments.”
In this respect Posthuma is very much
concerned with the port’s areas of vul-
nerability, particularly its heavy depen-
dence on oil. Progress so far has been
serene. With Europort’s head start with
facilities for supertankers and the sim-
plicity of the mechanics of oil, this has
not really been surprising. Difficulties
could arise if the oil base were shaken,
and much of Posthuma’s current effort
is dedicated to diversifying the port’s
activities.
Europort’s heaviest competition could
come in general cargo, a category that
now accounts for only 19.8 million of
the 130 million-ton total. Other ports
are moving briskly ahead with container
facilities. As with oil, whoever gets
ahead in containers will probably stay
ahead. Europort has countered with its
own container terminal, but Posthuma’s
main interest now is building up bulk
commodities, especially ore. His dream
in this regard is to attract a steel plant
to Europort. He already has aluminium
and molybdenum. If he gets steel
and strong feelers are out now from
German interests then Europort’s
prosperity will be as soundly based as
possible.
Posthuma sees the great carriers de-
livering an assortment of ores to a
widely diversified metals layout, and
the latter feeding an equally diversified
manufacturing spread. It all adds up
to a planner’s dream of industry.
Posthuma himself speaks like a man
building a new world, as indeed he is.
His finger draws a line across a huge
map of the area to show the course
of the great dikes that will close out
the sea and alter the coastline. Here
will be a harbor, there recreational
areas and parks for the inflowing popu-
lation. It is a Utopian concept of the
mutual accommodation of the needs of
society and industry. This, one is sure,
is what an overpopulated, environment-
conscious, and consumer-trained society
will require the meticulous planning,
the reclamation, the clinical erasure of
the untidy past, the contrived social
balance. It is all brilliant and persuasive,
but rather frightening.
You travel out on wide, new high-
ways, through great tunnels, past bridges
that reach across dry land, but where
water eventually will flow in controlled
canals, and over areas of reclaimed
land. Forests have been planted. A town
that had a population of 3500 in 1958
has swollen to almost 100,000. Here
is a small church built by the Nor-
wegians to serve sailors from the many
Norwegian tankers. There is a heli-
port and a hotel for sailors. New land-
scaped factories are scattered on the
reclaimed lands and. among old farm-
houses resignedly huddled on patches
of remaining pastures awaiting their
fate. A few years ago this was one of the
most placidly pastoral and self-
contained regions in Europe, its life-
indistinguishable from what it had been
for centuries.
“This used to be a famous bird sanc-
tuary,” one of Posthuma’s young assis-
tants told me, gesturing toward
emptiness. “During the war we used to
walk out here, a whole gang of boys,
and camp. It seemed very far then
because there was no transport. At
that house there, the farmer gave us
fresh milk and it was so good I said,
‘My God, this is nice,’ and he threw
us out for using the name of the Lord
in vain; that was what they were like,
but it’s all gone.”
Standing in that lovely lowlands
light so familiar to us from the can-
vases of the Dutch and Flemish masters,
I felt overcome by a sense of loss of a
sort which, I suspect, henceforth is to
be a distinctive experience of our times.
Yet no one I spoke to seemed to mind.
Europort-Delta is the future, and they
have accepted it. “Every Dutchman
knows to what extent he is dependent
on it,” my guide said. “It’s our insur-
ance premium we are building for
our grandchildren.”

HOMOSEXUALS IN MARRIAGE
Happily ever after
BY A SPECIAL
CORRESPONDENT
FROM PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT
with three women I reacted with some-
thing like horror to the optimism with
which psychologist Dr. William S.
Rowe, in a recent “Medical Journal of
Australia,” recounts the results of his
experiments with group therapy for
homosexuals.
“A male in the group,” Dr. Rowe
wrote, “who felt he had a homosexual
drive but had never given in to it was
unable to discuss this in the group for
the first six months, but improvement
commenced from this point and in-
creased steadily. He is now contem-
plating becoming engaged.” (The
italics are mine.)
In his article Dr. Rowe estimates that
there are about 250,000 Australian
homosexuals.
There are, roughly, six million males
in Australia, but half of them must
either be under the age of puberty,
and their sexual condition unknown, or
of an age which exempts them from
sexual leanings. This would leave,
again roughly, three million men of
whom 250,000 are believed to be homo-
sexuals—that is, one in 12. And, if
considered in relation to marriageable
males—aged 18 to, say, 35—the propor-
tion could be greater.
With such richness of opportunity it
is astonishing that one can go through
much of life without confronting this
problem; then suddenly it can become
commonplace.
In the past year I have known three
cases —two intimately and the third
less so —of men suppressing their homo-
sexual tendencies and marrying. These
marriages and their outcome were
startlingly alike.
In all cases the men had proposed
to women about 30 years old who had
divorced their husbands for infidelity
and had young children in their custody.
One woman had three children and the
others each had one. All the women
said they had been reassured, rather
than alarmed, by the low sexual drive
of their new prospective partners dur-
ing courtship, and the courtships were,
in any case, brief. They were not look-
ing for ardent lovers but for affection,
a safe haven, respectability, and a home
for their children.
And all related that in the humilia-
tion of the marriage bed their partners
broke down and revealed that they
thought a woman who had been
married, etcetera, would be “more ex-
perienced.”
A painful inference, actually stated
by two, was that a failed wife with
the encumbrance of children had little
to lose and should be grateful for what
she got.
In one case the young man, aware of
his sexual bias, alarmed by a slight
encounter with the law, afraid of the
effect on his career should it become
known, made a bid for respectability
by proposing marriage to a young
woman recently divorced. One assumes
charitably that he hoped the marriage
would work.
The fact that a woman who has
suffered an unfaithful husband and the
indignity of divorce has, herself, per-
sonality problems and needs constant
reassurance was either unknown or
unconsidered.
The woman in this case was too
ashamed by her divorce and fearful of
public opinion to consider ending this
farcical marriage at once; but after
months of mutual torment the man
quietly disappeared and has not been
heard of since.
Naturally the woman was the greater
loser; she lost the maintenance of her
former husband, she lost her second
(and perhaps last) chance of achieving
the happily married state, and she lost
social esteem. The man at least gained
the desired distinction of being a
married man.
In the second case the marriage lasted
fifteen years. Women of an earlier
generation have little knowledge of
sexual deviation, and she, a simple
woman, was completely unaware of the
nature of her husband’s condition. She
was made to feel his impotence was
her fault, that irreparably she had in-
jured his sensibilities at the honey-
moon period by evincing surprise and
dismay. It is probable that he, too, was
unable to diagnose his aversion.
One of a large “normal” family, he
was brought up in the country where,
though possibly not unknown, homo-
sexuality would be unexpected, unthink-
able, and certainly unspeakable.
Though he had what is called a
“cissy” way of speaking, laughing, and
walking, was something of a “mummy’s
boy,” and was thought by contemporary
young bricks a bit of a joke, he had
conformed to the usual pattern of chas-
ing after girls and especially those
known as easy girls. Later, he admitted
(to his wife) that he had never really
been able to “come at it” nor “bring it
off.” He thought himself too fastidious.
The wife’s longing for children
became an obsession and she consulted
several doctors. In a highly nervous con-
dition, finally, she consulted a psycholo-
gist and by this means was informed
that she had married a repressed homo-
sexual.
In the third case, the wife, a pro-
fessional woman, early became recon-
ciled to the peculiarities of her marriage;
accepted as compensatory factors the
home for her children and the work
which filled her life. But after 19 years
of living like brother and sister, the man
left her suddenly to follow some dis-
covered religious vocation.
It is interesting that in all three cases
the men were, or became, intensely
religious in a highly personal way; not
as humble suppliants but rather in a
priest-like role. The celibacy of Christ
and the saints no doubt provided the
inspiration; while the New Testament
treatment of sexuality as an unfortunate
aberration of man, and of women as
temptresses, man’s spiritual enemy, pro-
vided the drive.
All attached themselves actively to a
church organisation. Two were ortho-
dox Protestant and one Evangelist. As
I see it, this had a manifold purpose,
if purpose is the word (more likely it
should be described as self-therapy by
instinct). The ritual and authori-
tarianism sheltered them while the
spiritual emphasis was an escape from
mundane considerations. It made them
feel better men. Moreover, like chasing
after girls, like the decision to marry,
attachment to a church provided a good
public image. Immense respectability
still pertains to the church, to those
who attend, and especially to those who
perform in the church’s service. They
all fancied themselves as preachers.
The experiences of the women who
married these three repressed homo-
sexuals seem also to have run on
parallel lines: bewilderment, anger, self-
doubt. Their husbands disliked the feel
of their hair, the touch of their hands,
their natural odor. The fear, started
by losing their first husbands to other
women, was reinforced: they believed
they lacked womanly appeal.
Then they became jealous. They were
jealous of one known woman, of one
of whom they had heard, or even of
imagined women. They concluded they
had been “second best”; that they had
caught their husbands on the rebound
from some former love affair.
For the homosexual husband may be
publicly a flirt. He may leave his wife
at parties to pay attention to other
women, to dance with them, praise their
appearance and kiss their cheeks in an
affectionate manner. He especially is
often good at charming older women
with whom he likes to have long, serious
conversations; who are flattered and
impressed by his thoughtfulness and
good manners. He seems quite a ladies’
man. Perhaps he is more comfortable
with women than with men.
And, again, it may be part of the
image he assiduously (perhaps uncon-
sciously) builds.
His wife’s jealousy may not bother
him at all. No doubt it gratifies his
will-to-power—a natural human attri-

ANTRUM
Cleared up without Operation
Here is a treatment completely different from all others. Nothing to take into
the stomach—no drugs, drops, or menthol to be used year after year. Instead,
two inhalations daily for a while. The dry healing fumes come in direct contact
with all the air passages in the head and chest clearing away that offending rub-
bish which causes all the discomfort. Head .noises disappear, hearing and sense
of smell are frequently restored, running eyes and nose and the constant sneez-
ing fits disappear. You wake in the morning with nostrils and throat quite clear,
one handkerchief is sufficient and you are able to mix with others without
embarrassment. Here is a report telling how one very bad sufferer was healed.
A nurse had to give up her work—she suffered dreadfully from Catarrh, with
badly infected Antrum and Sinus, had terrific head noises and was almost stone
deaf—after using Membrosus for a time she wrote,
“Membrosus has worked wonders; I am back nursing again and bless the day
l started using it. I am breathing freely—my head and chest have cleared up —
my hearing is almost normal—and head noises have disappeared. The local
doctor cannot believe lam better —I feel wonderful, thanks to Membrosus.”
You, too, can get similar relief by inhaling the wonderful drugless Dry Inhalant
— Membrosus—proved over a period of 40-odd years.

your complaint.

bute—and it conceals that which sub-
consciously he wants to conceal.
Confronted by mere jealousy, or nag-
ging, he can be imperturbable. He can
be unmoved by his wife’s tears. But in
a proper row, where insults are ex-
changed, he may become highly
emotional and will cry. Threats to his
public image can bring him to a state
of hysteria.
Inclined to dandyism, he may resent
his wife making herself attractive at his
expense, and can become mean with
money. He doesn’t feel responsible for
her “keep” and may think, if she can’t
keep herself, her former husband
should be supporting her as well as the
children.
That this behaviour should not be
judged in the context of normal manly
males is obvious. The homosexual hus-
band, deprived of the normal compen-
sations of the married state, sexual satis-
faction and children of his own, reacts
like any human caught in a bad deal.
He is as bitchy as a woman.
The women I knew who were trapped
in this situation admitted freely they
had behaved badly. “I was a screaming
harridan,” one said. “I became slovenly
with the house and meals, and insulted
his mother, to whom he was much
attached,” said another.
But homosexuals who have recognised
and accepted their condition socially
tend to be quite acceptable to women.
Lacking aggression, they are more com-
panionable, more anxious to please than
manly men; with them, a woman can
“be herself” even more than with other
women. And they are more amusing
than women friends.
Few women, however —unless their
known passion for reforming the male
was developed to the point of mania—
knowingly would want to marry a
homosexual; even one with what Dr.
Rowe describes as “a faint glimmer of
heterosexual interest.”
Creditable as it may be that the
human sciences, as represented by Dr.
Rowe, seek to resolve the personality
problems of the homosexual and pos-
sibly rehabilitate him; and, understand-
able, society’s passion for conformity
and uniformity, some questions should
be asked on women’s behalf: What of
the unwitting females who may marry
the homosexual who has been “treated”
either by the aversion method (electric
shocks or drugs to cause aversion while
being shewn homosexual pictures) or
by “group therapy,” in which six of
them talk out and eventually recognise
their problem!
What of the poor girl who is expected
to provide the advanced therapy? Will
she know of her fiance’s homosexual
drive, even though he has “never given
in to it”? And what are the chances of
a satisfactory marriage if she does not;
or, even worse to my way of thinking,
if she does?

General G.ap a long time to make up

fight for the towns reached an end.
The Viet Cong is still holding out
in parts of Saigon, and in a number
of towns in the southern delta and the
central hills. The full evidence is
simply not in yet. It will not be in
until 20 or 30 separate actions, prob-
ably including the set-piece slogging
match at Khe Sanh, have been fought
through to a finish. And until the
evidence is in, hasty political conclu-
sions are hostages to the battle itself.

® ut tbls 1S war s are decided,
The war in Vietnam is unusual in many
ways. It is a strange combination of
guerilla tactics and science-fiction
technology; it is unique in the fact
that it is being fought out under the
television camera’s eye. But for all that
it is going to be decided by the criteria
that govern how all wars are won or
lost: by who holds the ground; by who
suffers the fewer casualties; by who
can replace his casualties best. Sooner
or later in every war one combatant,
measuring it in these terms, decides that
he has had enough. And it is by these
criteria, not by premature claims of
victory by either side, that the present
battle will have to be judged.
There are two things in particular
that are worth pointing out. The first
is about the towns. Tf the allies succeed
in clearing the Viet Cong out of the
towns and they must, if they want
to keep the upper hand the situation
the retreating guerillas leave behind
will not be what the Communists
claim it will be. The Viet Cong will
have intimidated many people. They
will have demonstrated that the towns
are no havens of security. That is a
score to them. But they have not man-
aged to whistle up any sign of the
“general uprising” they called for, ex-
cept in the Chinese township of Cholon
(which is an odd achievement for a
movement that claims to be a Viet-
namese nationalist one) and perhaps
in Hue, too. And the frightened towns-
people they leave behind will not want
to see them come back. It is often said
that the allies’ sweeps through the
countryside turn the local people
against them. The people who say that
cannot now say that the Viet Cong’s
sweep through the cities will work any
differently. People who want no more
than to keep the war out of their homes
will go along with whoever is trying to
ward the other side off. It is the old
war rule: what counts is control of
the ground.
The second point is about the situa-
tion in the countryside after the towns
have been cleared. It is a grisly near-
certainty that Viet Cong execution
squads have taken their chance during
the confusion in the towns to kill a
lot of village officials and a lot of the
young idealists who work in the
Revolutionary Development teams. It
will be another score to them. But
against this must be set the swath
that the town fighting has cut through
the Viet Cong’s ranks. The allied
estimates 25,000 Viet Cong dead
are doubtless too high. They presum-
ably include many civilians found in
the ruins, as well as guesswork by
platoon commanders who haven’t the
time to stop and count. But even if
that figure is halved the attackers’
casualties have been enormous.
The Viet Cong have put something
like half of their available main-force
units into this offensive. It was probably
the better half, and included many of
the North Vietnamese who have been
sent south to stiffen the already bat-
tered guerilla battalions. Half this
attacking force will very likely never
get back to base. That would be the
equivalent of nearly a year’s local
supply of recruits. This grinding in the
town battle is bound to tell if the war
goes on. It will affect the Viet Cong’s
hold on its own part of the countryside
as well as its ability to move back into
the areas it has lost in the past 18
months. The Communists can make
these calculations, too. They presumably
made (hem in 19 ' 65 . when attack J a
thf' towns would have been much easier
thef towns would have been much easier
because they were stronger and the
Americans were weaker. The fact that
they are doing now what they refrained
from doing in 1965 is another reason
for thinking that they are now betting
very heavily indeed on pulling a poli-
tical victory out of a military gamble,
Napoleon said that providence is
alwa £ on the side of the last reserve.
President Johnson is playing his Far
East crisis as cool as he can: in Korea
as we n as Vietnam. Mr. Wilson, visit-
ing Washington, did not need to urge
J y rest raint 0 A him. But there has
been a touch of something close to mys-
ticism in what some other people have
been claiming. They have decided that
the Communists are invincible because
their reserves are limitless and they can
go on raising new armies as long as they
like. Marxists who believe that people
are neatly divided into “the people”
and a handful of oppressors may accept
this. Non-Marxists are under no obliga-
tion to believe anything of the sort. And
if the North Vietnamese themselves be-


lieved it, it is odd that they should have
risked so much of his cataclysmic push
for a quick decision. Life is more com-
plicated than that and so is war. What
is at stake now in Vietnam is not
whether there should be negotiations,
or who should take part in them. It is
whether t'he Communists should come
to the negotiating table claiming the
right to name their terms. That will be
decided by the battle—and not just by
its first few days.

Surprised by the unexpected
“WHAT WE EXPECT is upon us,”
said President Johnson on February 2
of the Communist onslaught in the
South Vietnamese towns and “the
ability to do what they have done has
been anticipated, prepared for, and
met.” No doubt, as the President said,
intelligence appreciations did exist
pointing to an open Communist attack
on the North around Khe Sanh, and
a guerilla attack in the cities around
this time. But the force, the determin-
ation, the timing, and the numbers of
the raids evidently surprised the
American military, caught the South
Vietnamese authorities and their
troops off guard, and have left the
Administration in Washington discon-
certed and confused. The spokesmen
might have had a better time of it
if some of this could have been
admitted.
When the Secretary of State and
the Secretary of Defence made an un-
usual joint appearance on television
an obvious attempt to reassure people
hastily arranged by the White Plouse
with one network after another net-
work had turned the proposal down
both had to face some embarrassing
questions. Mr. McNamara was pre-
eluded from admitting that the com-
mand in Vietnam had been taken by
surprise by the fact that the Presi-
dent had already asserted the contrary.
He admitted as much as propriety
would permit: “We didn’t know the
date on which these guerilla attacks
would take place and we didn’t know
the specific targets.” In his embarrass-
ment he even looked around for some-
thing else to admit, and volunteered
that he had been wrong not to advise
President Kennedy against the Bay of
Pigs operation in 1961.
He was also questioned with uncon-
cealed scepticism about the official
claims of enemy killed in last week’s
fighting., Against the usual practice,
statistics of enemy dead had to be
accepted in the confusion last week
from South Vietnamese commanders
without verification by American
officers. But the reliability of these
figures is important to the claims made
by President Johnson, Mr. Dean Rusk,
and a multitude of spokesmen, that the
communist effort failed, that is, that it
achieved nothing proportionate to the
cost in men.
Mr. Joseph Alsop, a regular de-
fender of Mr. Johnson’s Vietnam
policy, of whom it must be conceded
that he follows the war more con-
scientiously and knows more about it
than any other commentator, did his
best this week to strike a favorable
balance honestly. The reckless waste of
men by the Communists is the key
piece in Mr. Alsop’s reckoning.
Against the communist losses he sets
the adverse facts: “Pacification has been
set back. Great destruction has been
wrought in some cities. Confidence has
been shaken.” He concludes that the
final balance sheet will be unfavorable
to General Giap, provided that any
further attacks are successfully thrown
back and that South Vietnam can
quickly be restored to working order,
This is about the most favorable in-
dependent assessment to be found, and
it is more reserved than is usual for
Mr. Alsop. The “Wall Street Journal”
reporter in Saigon reports this week
that a majority of American officials
there admit a considerable setback, both
military and psychological,
Others in Washington have begun to
question General Westmoreland’s judg-
ment, understandably enough; after all,
it was only in November that he was
brought back together with the Ameri-
can Ambassador in Saigon, Mr. Ells-
worth Bunker, to radiate confidence and
optimism at home. Tireless in briefings
and speeches, the two principal Ameri-
can representatives in Vietnam brought
President Johnson a useful reinforce-
ment against his critics. But not a sign
has there been since then either of
the allied progress or of the com-
munist decline that General Westmore-
land foresaw. “Almost exactly the
opposite is happening,” observed an-
other correspondent, Mr. Marquis
Childs, on Wednesday and he went on
to recall how Lincoln had got rid of
General McClellan when things got
serious in the Civil War.
As the bad news poured in from
Saigon, evidence mounted of President
Johnson’s refusal to be drawn into any
further trouble with North Korea. The
seizure of the Pueblo, which Mr.
Rusk characterised when it happened
as an act of war, now belongs to the
field of diplomatic manoeuvre. Asked
at his news conference on February 2 if
he were still confident that he would
get back the crew and the ship, Presi-
dent Johnson said roundly “No, I am
not.” And added: “All I can say is that
things take time.” Mr. McNamara and
Mr. Rusk, in their joint television
appearance on Sunday, continued the
retreat, in a manner which somewhat
brutally jettisoned the United States
representative at the United Nations,
Mr. Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, it will
be remembered, assured the Security
Council with charts, monitored quota-
tions, and directional fixes that the
Pueblo did not enter the territorial
limits claimed by North Korea. A
great many people heard and saw his
exposition on radio and television.
Mr. McNamara said on Sunday that
in 12 days before its seizure the
Pueblo had maintained radio silence,
and therefore “we can’t say beyond a
shadow of a doubt that at no time
during its voyage it entered North
Korean waters.” Mr. Rusk added, “We
cannot be a thousand percent sure.”
The process was taken a stage further
on Monday by a State Department
spokesman, who explained that Mr.
Goldberg in his exposition to the
United Nations Security Council “was
directing his remarks to the day it (the
Pueblo) was seized.” Next, it was
made known that the aircraft carrier
Enterprise, which took station off the
North Korean coast soon after the
seizure of the Pueblo, was being with-
drawn from the vicinity with, pre-
sumably, its powerful escorting fleet.
Explanations have been coming in
from Seoul of the previously unex-
plained failure to attempt to rescue
the Pueblo during the several hours
when it was being kidnapped. The
answer seems to be that no conventional
air forces were available in or near
South Korea to do the job, everything
that might have served having been
drawn off long ago for use in Vietnam.
With this explanation, the remark of
Senator Jackson of Washington after
the seizure, that a fight with North

Korea would require tactical nuclear
weapons for lack of other forces, it
also explained. Senator Jackson is well
informed about the state of the armed
services.
To suggest that the United States was
at the end of its resources would be
absurd. As Mr. McNamara said on
Sunday, it was able to send three air-
■craft carriers, other ships, and strong
air reinforcements to Korea, and “we
can send additional aircraft or addi-
tional ground forces from our active
forces, should that prove necessary.”
This is true. But it would be hard to
have to do it, and until President
Johnson sees his way clear in Viet-
nam, it is now plain that he will go
to considerable lengths to avoid having
to do it. This must have resulted from
a painful self-examination since Janu-
ary 22 when the Pueblo was seized,
for the mood that is evident now is
very different from the mood that pre-
vailed in the Administration on the
day or two following the seizure.
Viet Cong rockets hit houses behind the An Quang pagoda
Saigon
Choosing sides
From MARK FRANKLAND in Saigon
NOW THAT THE Vietnam war has
turned topsy-turvy, you return to Saigon
after a trip to the comparatively peace-
ful countryside to see thick columns
of smoke pushing up into the grey
evening haze over the city. Two thou-
sand revolutionary development cadres,
the much-vaunted shock troops
designed to recapture the peasantry for
the Saigon Government, have had to
bt sent to bring comfort and relief
to the supposedly secure inhabitants of
the capital.
The most obvious achievement of the
Viet Cong offensive has been to present
the Government with a massive job of
reconstruction in the towns. And there
is already an incomplete count of
330,000 urban refugees, though it is
hoped that some of them have homes
still standing to go back to.
In the event, things did not move in
the way forecast in the Viet Cong
command’s final order of the day, but
an earthquake has hit the cities with
consequences that neither side can yet
predict.
It is unlikely that the Viet Cong
planned it this way. Their hopes seem
to have been for a general offensive
lasting some weeks, leading to irres-
istible pressures abroad for talks and a
coalition for peace” Government in
South Vietnam.
Our political cadre said this was to
be the decisive victory—the big battle,”
a young North Vietnamese soldier who
had given himself up told me yester-
day.
Gentle provincial capitals in the delta
like My Tho and Ben Tre have been a
quarter to a third destroyed. Over a
thousand Viet Cong held out in appar-
ently good order in Saigon. Hue, the
touchiest city in the country where the
Government and the Americans are
concerned, was toughly fought over,
An uneasy feeling is growing that
the Government and American military,
in the reaction to the Viet Cong attack,
committed grave mistakes. It is the
old story of over-hasty use of the
massive Allied firepower, this time not
against the occasional village, but in
heavily built-up areas,
It is instructive to look at an area
where the American command saw this
trap and sought to avoid it. The Viet
Cong launched a heavy attack on the
big airfield at Bien Hoa and the sprawl-
ing American army base at nearby
Long Binh, 20 miles from Saigon. There
is a big population of North Viet-
namese Catholic refugees settled in this
area, notably at a place called Ho Nai.
General Weygand, commander of
the American second field force, who
has a reputation for his understanding
of the political content of the war,
immediately sought to stop his com-
manders from using artillery, air-
strikes, and helicopter gunships against
the Viet Cong infesting these villages.
Even so, the damage done is instruc-
tive. The South Vietnamese army
opened fire with recoilless rifles from
its Third Corps headquarters into a
housing area for soldiers’ families
directly opposite when they found Viet
Cong there. Nothing was left standing.
A rocket-firing helicopter hit a hos-
pital run by Canadian monks and a
nearby school and church. “We just
lay down and prayed till it was over,”
said one of the monks. Some dozen
people were killed, none of them Viet
Cong. Next day, the Americans came
and said it was a mistake. “They didn’t
know if there were Viet Cong there or
not,” the monk explained. In another
Catholic settlement a little gothic rec-
tangular box of a church, such as you
might see in a dingy London suburb,
had been hit by rockets.
Six dead Viet Cong were found on
either side of the wooden altar with its
pale plaster saints. “But that’s not the
point,” said an American officer. “As
an infantryman, I know it would have
been possible to get them out in a
different way.”
The importance of these examples
is that they come from a staunch anti-
Communist area. The Catholic vil-
lagers have asked to be given weapons
so that they can defend themselves,
but so far they have little more than
sharpened staves. Yet even here the
people’s reaction to the fighting is
equivocal. You could even find people
who admitted that the Viet Cong had
behaved properly toward them. A
young girl wearing a plastic cross said:
“When the Viet Cong entered our
house they saw my mother was preg-
nant, so they said we should leave
because the Americans were coming
and it would be dangerous.”
An old man said: “You’re a jour-
nalist. Tell the Americans there aren’t
any Viet Cong here now, so they
mustn’t shoot at the people any more.”
The Canadian monk, almost too good
to be true, with his white hair and
sturdy brown face, said: “The people
resent all this a bit, but not so much
as to be anti-American.”
He was probably right, but he did
not seem to know that a few miles
down the road, at the end of the
Catholic settlement, people had said
that Viet Cong cadres were still appear-
ing. Presumably someone was listening
to them—this a week after the big
battle was over.
These reactions are important be-
cause some of the best American
officials here are hoping that the shock
of the Viet Ceng attack will make the
Vietnamese realise that finally they
must choose sides. Certainly the tough
policies that President Thieu now wants
to apply depend on this for their suc-
cess.


Singapore
Lee’s Opposition takes election
lying down
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Singapore
Lee ... out on his own
FEW IF ANY democratic governments
dissolve Parliament with a cheerful
proclamation implying that they will
definitely be in a majority when Parlia-
ment reassembles. Imagine Mr. Wilson
doing such a thing; even his own Party
men would be muttering about one
more promise he will not keep. But
then, imagine The Bulletin editorialis-
ing before an election to the effect that
the Gorton Government and the Liberal-
Country Party should do all they can
to see that Mr. Whitlam is able to
lead an effective Opposition .. . imagine
Whitlam and Co. meeting to decide
whether they should after all contest
the elections . . . while such imaginings
may seem to belong to the other side
of sanity, the fact is that the Singapore
equivalent of these events actually hap-
pened last week.
Thus, on Wednesday, February 7,
after the weekly Cabinet meeting, a
statement was issued announcing that
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had ad-
vised the President to dissolve Parlia-
ment as from the Bth, meaning that
a general election must be held within
three months. The statement concluded
by noting that all Bills now before
Parliament would lapse, but the public
was reassured that “it is the intention
of the Government to reintroduce them
when Parliament reconvenes after the
general election.”
Since it is virtually impossible to
place a bet here that the People’s
Action Party will not win all 58 seats,
not unsurprisingly the “Sin Chew Jit
Pao” newspaper next morning editorial-
ised to the effect that “we have no
doubt that the Government has a role
to play in fostering the emergence of
an Opposition Party.” Meanwhile
the Opposition Barisan Socialis
(Socialist Front), having declared
Singapore’s independence, Parliament’s
by-elections, and even the British with-
drawal to be all “phony,” met
to decide whether these general elec-
tions are in the same category and
should therefore also be boycotted.
In the event the Barisan Socialists
preferred discretion to valor. Since “Lee
Kuan Yew has shown Washington and
London that he will faithfully serve
the interests of the United States-
British Imperialism in Singapore” and
because to take part in elections “can
only help hoodwink the people” the
Barisans will boycott them.
Ironically this is good political horse
sense. Better by far say many observers
for the Barisans —who cornered a 32
percent vote last election —to leave the
PAP guessing as to their residual
strength rather than go down to what
would have been a crushing defeat.
Nomination day has now been set for
February 17 and legally polling day
could be a scant nine days afterwards.
Not surprisingly, therefore, “the
opposition does not have the chance of
a snowball in hell” came immediately
to the lips of the ex-Chief Minister of
self - governing Singapore, David
Marshall, when informed by The Bul-
letin that the election was imminent.
Marshall is, unhappily, all too correct.
There need not have been an election
until November, but on current
Opposition form it would make no
difference. The Left-wing Barisans
seemingly await for inspiration from
Peking. The Right-wing Singapore
Alliance likewise looks to Kuala
Lumpur. Both the Chinese and Malay-
sian capitals would have good reason to
be somewhat disenchanted with their
erstwhile stooges. Admittedly the Singa-
pore version of UMNO—or Singapore
Malaya National Organisation—is show-
ing some signs of fight, but since there
are only two seats where Malay voters
have a clear majority their influence is
likely to be only marginal. There will
be numerous independents in all proba-
bility, but, since you can only fight the
PAP with an efficient organisation,
their effect will be even slighter. The
PAP has currently 49 out of 51 seats in
Parliament. It’s odds-on that they will
improve their percentage.
So the next time you hear Aus-
tralian, or any other, politicians talk-
ing about Lee Kuan Yew as “a man
who speaks our language,” watch him—
it is probably that he’s just wishing he
was in Lee’s seemingly omnipotent
shoes.
Or are they? Could it be that the
suddenness of this election announce-
ment is caused by fears of future im-
potence? Unworried about the non-
opposition, is the PAP actually running
against itself, and against time?
Thoughts such as these stem from
one compelling fact —this accelerated
election comes as a direct result of the
accelerated withdrawal. As already
reported in The Bulletin the result of
Lee’s London trip has been protracted
rethinking by the PAP Cabinet about
its current and future position. Some
sources suggest, other reliable ones
deny, that it has also led to a diverg-
ence, even rift, between Lee and
Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee over
the future course of relations with
Britain, Japan, and possibly Malaysia,
too.
Since Lee’s return from London the
Cabinet has discussed and argued in
private, but the Ministers have done
much less speechifying compared with
their usually profuse public output. Now
these discussions will proceed from
Cabinet to the PAP executive com-
mittee as the election manifesto is ham-
mered into shape. A likely outcome of
this process is that the PAP will seek
its third successive mandate by asking
for a vote of confidence in Lee’s
leadership, and stressing his policy of
still balancing Singapore’s survival be-
tween old unreliables such as Britain
and new imponderables (the United
States and Japan, Russia and China).
What one would love to know but
cannot guess is how Cabinet has argued
about irremovable neighbors—lndo-
nesia, Malaysia, Australia.
Put another way, few if any demo-
cratic parties have to prepare an elec-
tion manifesto in the sure knowledge of
certainly losing roughly seven percent
of GNP per annum for the next three
years, population growth excluded.
In such circumstances, facing massive
difficulties, not every government
would want to win another term.
Britain
Wilson as "one
of the mob"
AFTER BEING welcomed almost as
an equal by President Johnson, Harold
Wilson may find it hard to adjust him-
self to his new diminished role in his
own government. For at No. 10, to
which he returned this week, he has
lost his almost Presidential status and
now finds himself only one member of
a collective leadership.
Whether or not he is back only “on
probation,” there is no doubt that the
key “Gaitskellites” among his top col-
leagues are determined to preserve the
share in the exercise of power which
they have won in recent weeks.
The secrecy with which Cabinet
activities are shrouded means that it will
be some time before constitutional ex-
perts can ascertain how far the pat-
tern of British Government has
changed.
What is certain is that the Prime


British Prime Minister Harold Wilson talks with President Johnson in Washington,
but then goes home to find his own power diminished
Minister has established the precedent
of making a series of crucial Cabinet
decisions dependent on counting heads.
This was the method used to decide
what items of public expenditure should
be cut, and voting often took place
with no clear indication of what the
Prime Minister himself wanted.
Explosive issues like the postpone-
ment of the higher school leaving age
and the cancelling of the F-11l order
were decided by hair’s-breadth maj-
orities. According to veteran civil ser-
vants, the in-fighting that went on
behind the scenes at the ministries was
the “dirtiest” they had ever seen.
On the other hand, official Cabinet
session were singularly restrained.
The Prime Minister would ask the
Departmental Minister to state his case,
invite Roy Jenkins to give the Treasury
view, allow the'‘Deputy Leader, George
Brown, and the non-departmental Mini-
sters to have their say, and then call
for a show of hands, conscientiously
counting them and announcing the
result.
1 • was a complete departure from
the normally informal method by
which the Prime Minister listened to
the arguments and then pronounced
himself on what he euphemistically
chose to call “the Cabinet view”
with the understanding that anyone
who could not go along with it could
resign.
The shift from individual to collec-
tive leadership followed immediately
after the Cabinet almost fell apart in
the row over arms to South Africa
just before Christmas.
Wilson’s critics are now trying to see
how they can prevent the Prime Minis-
ter from slipping out of their control
and once more trying to whip up sup-
port from the Party’s Left Wing to re-
store his own position as the one man
who can hold the Party together.
Given the tight financial situation,
Wilson’s area of manoeuvre is limited.
Some of his critics suspect he may
make concessions on the foreign front,
for example, by dissociating Britain
from the United States or by withdraw-
ing the application for Britain to join
the Common Market.
Alternatively, he might throw a bone
to the Left on domestic cuts soften-
ing up on wage controls, selective
benefits, or indirect taxation, or propos-
ing some new measure of public owner-
ship.
The critics are all the more nervous
because the Government’s efforts to
restore Party discipline have foun-
dered. The 24 rebels who refused to
endorse the cuts have been formally
forbidden to attend Party group meet-
ings for a month. One young MP,
Brian Walden, has suggested that a
much more fearsome punishment would
be to force them to attend all the meet-
ings, clocking in and out.
All Mr. Wilson’s “Gaitskellite” col-
leagues are now girding themselves for
a stiff struggle with the Left, both in
Parliament and in the unions. And they
are resolved to see that the Prime
Minister is not allowed to break ranks,
at least until the economic crisis is
over.
It is still the Gaitskellites, however,
who occupy all the key Cabinet jobs
(the Exchequer, the Foreign Office, the
Home Office, Defence, Trade and
Labor). Nor do they expect any immin-
ent Government reshuffle.
During the climax of the South Afri-
can row, the Prime Minister sent a mes-
sage through the Party grapevine that
he would not tolerate being dominated
by a junta: if they went too far he
would go to the Queen and recommend
a dissolution.
There is certainly no doubt at the
Palace that unless, and until, a Prime
Minister resigns, his is the only authen-
tic voice of government to which the
Sovereign can listen.
All this is shadow boxing. Given the
present state of public opinion polls, no
Labor leader in his senses would
recommend an election. The argument
is significant only for revealing the
depth to which confidence between
Cabinet Ministers has sunk.
In practice, however, Mr. Wilson’s
prospects may be less bleak than they
look: though he has few colleagues he
can trust, he has nearly three years left
to win back his lost credit. One insider
put his finger on the weakness of the
Gaitskellite challenge: “Not enough
king-makers, too many kings.”
Belgium
Language barrier
BELGIUM is a serious, dedicated
member of the Common Market, and
Belgian businessmen abroad carry on
this impression of seriousness and
something near stolidity. It then seems
somewhat out of character that the
country’s Government should be
brought down because of strong feel-
ing about which language should pre-
dominate in Belgium’s largest univer-
sity, Louvain.
As the Quebecois are to Canada, the
Flemings have been to Belgium. The
difference is that in Belgium those who
feel themselves, linguistically, second-
class citizens happen also to be in the
majority 5.5 million to 4 million
French-speaking Walloons and that
prosperity, which once centred on the
Walloon coalfields, has shifted to the
Flemish industrial areas.
Long-standing linguistic resentment
lies behind Flemish attempts to force
out the French half of the university
of Louvain, a Flemish town. This was
the issue that brought down Mr. Paul
Vanden Boeynant’s coalition govern-
ment last week. But Flemish national-
ism now meets the new economic re-
sentment of areas overtaken by the
second industrial revolution and far
from satisfied with the central govern-
ment’s efforts to relieve them.
It is this background that has put so
much passion into the Louvain affair.
It springs from the linguistic law of
1963 which laid down that children not
only could but must be taught in their
mother-tongue. Louvain, Belgium’s larg-
est university, with roughly equal
French and Flemish sections, had so far
been exempted from this crude attempt
to reassert the Flemish language.
Flemish nationalists are eager to oust
the French-speakers from their last
point d’appui (before bilingual Brus-
sels, which may be the next target of
Flemish parochialism) in Flemish terri-
tory. But the Walloons do not today
have the economic security that might
have allowed them to give way com-
placently on this sort of point.
The Government fell because eight of
its Flemish-speaking Social Christian
Ministers, under pressure from national-
ists, would not accept Mr. Vanden
Boeynants’ attempts to keep out of the
Louvain dispute. It seems unlikely that
the political crisis can be resolved ex-
cept through fresh elections. But they
can hardly resolve the linguistic crisis.
And where will that end? It was only
three months ago that a Walloon
nationalist was writing in the Paris “Le
Monde” to demand whether the French
were uninterested that “a people” of
4,000,000 French-speakers were “fight-
ing for survival.”


South Korea
Order of priorities
Members of Seoul’s labor unions burn an effigy of North Korean Premier Kim II
Sung during a rally attended by about 50,000 people
IT IS A CLEAR CASE of national
priorities. For the Americans, the
most important recent event in Korea
was the capture of the Pueblo and its
83-man crew. For the South Koreans,
it was the attempted murder by North
Korean infiltrators of their president,
Mr. Park Chung Hee. For the Ameri-
cans, the Pueblo incident, however dis-
turbing, was basically a fringe distrac-
tion from the major crisis in Vietnam.
For the South Koreans, the threat
from the north is the central issue of
their national life. So it was inevitable
that Washington and Seoul would differ
in their approaches.
President Johnson has been playing
it as cool as he could possibly manage.
For a week now, one American officer
and one North Korean have been hold-
ing the quietest and most private talks
that have ever taken place in the shout-
ing room at Panmunjom. Mr. Rusk
and Mr. McNamara conceded on tele-
vision that they could not be absolutely
certain that the Pueblo had not been
in North Korean waters. The nuclear-
powered carrier the Enterprise was
ordered to move away from the North
Korean coast. It was rumored that
some agreement on the return of the
prisoners was being reached. Tension
subsided in Washington. But not in
Seoul.
South Korea’s Prime Minister, Mr.
Chung II Kwon, handed a formal pro-
test to the American ambassador in
Seoul last week at what he called
the American Government’s “lukewarm
attitude” toward “the threat of a North
Korean invasion.” He also protested
against the closed bilateral talks, which
excluded South Korea, and said that
his country “might have to take uni-
lateral self-defence measures.” These
measures, as suggested by members of
the South Korean national assembly,
could involve a withdrawal of South
Korea’s 48,000 men from Vietnam
and/or the removal of South Korea’s
home-based forces from the United
Nations command. The assembly
passed a resolution suggesting that
South Korea undertake military re-
prisals against the North, “alone, if
necessary.” On the same day the first
anti-American demonstrations in five
years took place outside Seoul’s Ameri-
can embassy, and next day at Pan-
munjom.
The South Koreans certainly speak
with fire in their bellies about what
they see as American concessions to
their arch-enemy in the north. Un-
questionably, too, there is a genuine
anxiety in South Korea about a, new
attempt by Marshal Kim II Sung to
unify the nation by force. But behind
this week’s anti-American demonstra-
tions and rhetoric there is also the clear
intention of exploiting the current crisis
to extract a large measure of military
aid from the Americans. South Korea
got an increase in aid two years ago
when it sent its soldiers to Vietnam.
It is likely to get more now for keeping
them there.
Thailand
Democracy by
inches
LIKE A WISE, fat water buffalo with
the stars and stripes wound around its
buttocks, Thailand is slowly backing
and inching into the strange mud-
wallow of democracy. There will be a
new constitution at some unappointed
future date. Probably this year there
will even be the first election since the
1957 coup which brought the prosper-
ous, happy-go-lucky nation under the
benevolent, if corrupt, rule of the late
Marshal Sarit.
Thailand’s new constitution will
authorise the King to appoint a prime
minister and a cabinet unaffected by
the wishes of the popularly elected
national assembly. If all goes well, the
first prime minister will be the admir-
able Minister of Economic Develop-
ment, Mr. Pote Sarasin. But even
though it will not control the executive,
an elected parliament will be able to
meet, vote, criticise, and denounce
corruption and military nepotism.
The Thais are an amiable, sceptical
people and Western residents have long
smiled over the appalling task which
would confront any Chinese-style Com-
munists who tried to take over the
country and impose communal disci-
pline and hard work. But every Thai
Army leader and politician knows that
coups have always been more important
in this country than votes. The curious
constitution and the unfamiliar election
will be more than justified if they give
the Thai people the strange intimation
that another military coup in hectic
Bangkok is no longer the only way in
which they can observe the changing
of the guard.
It is tempting but misleading to draw
an analogy between the chase-and-
shout brawling in north-eastern
Thailand and the early days of the
communist penetration into South
Vietnam. The Army has taken over
from the police—reflecting normal
Bangkok procedure—in the impover-
ished provinces where American aid
is at last beginning to bring results.
American green-beret “advisers” have
given the lead to counter-insurgency
work. But there is still no hard evi-
dence that the Thai peasants are pre-
paring to take up arms against Bangkok
and their king and queen.
The King can’t send elephants to
help Washington, as one king Qnce
offered to old Abe Lincoln. But he is
sending army units to fight in Vietnam
and his military advisers are —at the
moment —more hawkish than the
Americans. Bangkok will remain
hawkish.
North Vietnam is still cautious about
arousing the 40,000 North Vietnamese
who settled in north-eastern Thailand
after Dienbienphu. The Thais claim
that there are approximately 2000
armed communist guerillas in the
north-east, fortified by a few battalions
of North Vietnamese troops across the
river. The American-trained Thai
Army can restrain this limited aggres-
sion. And it is hard to believe that
the North Vietnamese would want to
try a full-scale drive into north-eastern
Thailand when this would inevitably
give the local Americans greater sanc-
tion and stronger effect.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Putting the way-out case
for import controls
IT LOOKED LIKE a stunt for the
benefit of its members; not even the
Chamber of Manufactures could really
expect to be taken seriously last week
when it called for a revival of import
controls in Australia. For Canberra is
the scene of an amazing number of
paper wars, as lobby groups ride their
hobbyhorses to remind their metro-
politan backers that they are still in
the political race. Getting away from
tariffs for once, the Chamber of Manu-
factures issued a Press statement
entitled “More efficiency needed in
assisting Secondary Industry” and say-
ing that the Government should tell its
Tariff Board that import controls be
given equal consideration with duties
in selecting means of giving protection
to Australian industry.
It appeared to suggest that import
controls would be especially apt in
industries like textiles and chemicals,
where the Government has applied
complex sliding-scale tariffs. The state-
ment went on in a passage which many
may find difficult to comprehend: “The
Vernon Report suggested that 20 per-
cent of the value of total imports into
Australia in 1962-63 was subject to pro-
tective duties. On 1966-67 figures this
suggests that some or all of $570 million
worth of imported goods enter this
country because of our inefficient tariff
system and replace locally produced
goods. It must be realised that a large
percentage of this $570 million of
foreign exchange, together with the
amounts spent on freight and insurance,
could be saved by making our tariff
machinery work more efficiently and
effectively than it has in the past few
years.” Hence the need to consider the
reintroduction of import controls.
The Wholesale Softgoods Federation
quickly responded with a counter-
statement: “With any system of import
quotas there is invariably disruption to
business and injustices to individual
companies because the selection of a
base period for imports will favor some
and penalise others. Restrictions would
adversely affect manufacturers who
themselves import goods as raw
materials or for further processing. The
proposal could only lead to further
interference in the internal workings
of the Tariff Board, whose independ-
ence was fundamental.”
Commenting on the proposal for
import controls on textiles, the Soft-
goods Federation said: “The board
recommended levels of duty that would
direct local textile production to the
most economic areas and prevent
unwise expansion in uneconomic sectors
of the industry.”
Surely neither group really thinks
there is a chance in the world of the
Australian Government reintroducing
import controls.
Safflower
Miracles are still
required
IT IS NOT SO MUCH a matter of
chickens coming home to roost as of
cows going home to milk. For the
dairymen look to have rid themselves
of one of their problems: the mar-
garine campaign to promote safflower
oilseeds as an efficient indigenous sub-
stitute for cows in producing a bread
spread superior to butter.
Safflower, promoted in the campaign
against margarine quotas as a “miracle
crop,” failed badly this year, and
spokesmen in Queensland and N.S.W.
have spoken gloomily of its future. In
Queensland last week Mr. P. Brauns,
managing director of the Pacific Saf-
flower firm which contracted to buy
most of the safflower sown, said only
11,000 tons of seed would now be pro-
duced compared with the expected
20,000 tons. Forty thousand acres of the
130,000 planted had failed completely
and yields were bad elsewhere. He
said there was “a lesson to be learned”
in the poor crop results. Safflower had
mistakenly been planted as a marginal
crop. A more scientific approach was
needed.
In N.S.W. an Agriculture Depart-
ment agronomist, Mr. J. Jessup, said
the dismal 1967 yield supported the
departmental view that the crop was
still not a commercial proposition. Only
2401 b. of seed had been produced per
acre, returning $lO per acre, far less
than cost of production. Despite de-
partmental warnings, some 13,000 acres
had been sown in 1967. Average yields
are about 4001 b. of seed per acre, but
the Department reckoned that this
would have to be quadrupled before a
good return could be got from the
Mr. McEwen... crack the whip
crop. Frost meant that planting had
to be delayed, leaving the harvesting
until four or five weeks after wheat.
During this period temperatures were
too high to allow the seed to gain
sufficient moisture.
Dairy farmers
A tale of woe,
and costs
UNLESS IT IS some other rural
organisation or Mr. McEwen, nobody
is better at telling the farmer’s tale of
woe than the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union, especially its Victorian
division, albeit it having the nation’s
wealthiest dairy farmers in its ranks.
The latest of these tales was told
to a meeting of dairymen members of
the Union in Melbourne last week. It
was to the effect that unless the Gov-
ernment reimbursed the dairymen for
the loss (equivalent to 2 cents a lb.
butterfat) consequent on sterling de-
valuation (doubtless a jog at Mr.
McEwen to keep his whips cracking ) r
together with recently enforced price
reductions of 3 to 4 cents lb. butterfat
resulting from more intensive competi-
tion in overseas markets, it would mean
an income drop of $lOOO a year for a
dairy farmer producing 20,0001 b. of
butterfat annually.
But the burden of the Union’s song
doesn’t end there. It will surprise many
knockers of the dairy industry to learn
that, although the Union’s calculations
look somewhat roughly based, it con-
siders that productivity in the industry
has increased by 10 to 12 percent over
the past two years and that all this
improvement has gone down the drain
because, on top of a fall of 1\ percent
in prices over this period, the dairy-
farmers’ costs have risen 6| percent.


THE WEEKB RIEFLY
For the economy: Australia’s trade figures swung
sharply to a deficit in January, 1968 . . . Wool prices since
January resumption of sales have lifted 9 percent for fine
good-quality Merino, with Japan the most prominent
buyer . . . The U.S. has given Australia and Fiji a revised
quota for raw sugar for the first quarter of 1968.
In the nationwide dispute over absorption of Metal Trades
award increases in over-award payments, the Commonwealth
Industrial Court in Sydney made an unprecedented blanket
no-strike order against seven N.S.W. metals trades unions.
The ACTU has taken over the conduct of the dispute.
For the markets: The Australian boom continued to
February 5, when the Sydney all-ordinaries index registered
an all-time high of 491.29. Overnight falls in London and
nervous local selling then triggered off a sharp fall, especi-
ally in the volatile mining and oil section, but by week’s end
there was a firming tendency overall, with London con-
firming the uptrend.
Heightening tensions in the Far East landed a knockout
wallop on Wall Street, and prices tumbled along a broad
front in active trading . . . Takeovers were the main feature
on London Stock Exchange.
For companies: Miners dominated the market, but in-
dustrials topped the news. Union Carbide announced its
third and biggest bonus in less than four years, and reported
striking progress in sales and profit for the December half . . .
Among the interim reporters, Rothmans stood out, with its
statement of doubled profit for the first half of the year to
June 30, 1968. It expects to show a solid recovery for the
full year, after last year’s setback . . . David Syme (Mel-
bourne “Age” publisher) earned steady profit in the
December half . . . ARC’s turnover was up but profit lower
. . . and Yellow Express Carriers profit was down . . . U.K.
and N.Z. devaluations caused Davis Gelatine profits to fall
for the December half.
Reporting better results for the six months to December
were Martin Bright Steels, Muswellbrook (profit up 20.5
percent), Felt and Textiles (a 6.3 percent improvement),
Bruck Mills (forward orders higher), James Miller, the
recently refloated Melbourne retailer, Georges Ltd. (profits
more than 10 percent better), Containers (expecting a record
for the full year), Rocla (which confirmed last year’s higher
15 percent dividend with interim percent), Mutual
Acceptance (profit up 24 percent), F. H. Stephens (profit
up 20 percent, from record turnover), Albert G. Sims (up
28 percent, and moved to increase dividend from an annual
rate of 12 j percent to 15 percent).
Esso-BHP denied a bid for Ampol . . . The board of the
Australia Hotel still favors the Stocks and Holdings takeover
offer, but there was a big buyer on the market at a few cents
above S. and H.’s price of $l.
To pay for the Foy and Gibson stores in Melbourne and
the Economic Store in Perth, Woolworths Ltd. is making a
$6 million unsecured note issue.
The only major unlisted beach-sand miner in Australia,
Murphyores Holdings Ltd., will place about one-third of the
four million issued shares through lan Potter . . . Metal
Exploration NL sold its 836,400 shares in Greenbushes Tin
NL apparently on the open market . . . Great Boulder has
borrowed $200,000 at call from its major shareholder
Loloma Mining Corporation.
MEN AND MATTERS
NOW THE MAJOR tennis nations are
coming in behind Wimbledon’s move
to make honest men of its future heroes,
there’s possibly less scope than there
used to be for a sportsmen’s guide on
how to succeed in business without
really trying. Post-war, the more pur-
poseful players, retired or otherwise,
have entered the business world, where
there have been quite a few gladiators
who’ve translated their sporting prowess
into successful endeavor and hard cash
—as Frank Sedgman’s new venture into
the hotel business at Frankston reminded
us. Like “Bonny” Muir, of Melbourne’s
Oasis, Sedgman has already made his
mark in the gymnasium business and,
with other tennis champs, as a hotelier
at Cowes. Peter Thomson, who recently
moved to a great mansion in South
Yarra, is another to have picked up a
pile of dollars in extra-mural activities
in that State.
In Sydney nobody has succeeded
better or more swiftly in business than
swimmer Frank O’Neill. In 1959, still
wet with Manly waters, O’Neill started
making concrete swimming baths and,
five years later, floated his company in
Pitt Street. Then, early last year, with
its 1965-66 earnings 45 percent on
capital, he sold a controlling interest to
Dunlops for a cool $340,000 or so.
For all that, unless you’re a Bradman,
it seems that the path of sportsmen to
Stock Exchange riches is not so clear
in this country as it is in London,
where many a sporting ace has been
put on stockbrokers’ letterheads. Sir
Donald returned to Adelaide (where
he only played cricket as a visitor) to
notch up a host of runs as a broker
and company director. But, alas, when
Harry Hopman went to the financial
courts of Collins Street from Kooyong
to capitalise his tennis career the story
was rudely different.
TRYING TO GET an interlocking
view of the Australian economy is an
exercise many have attempted but
almost as many have failed in by not
being able to see far enough beyond
their sectional noses. No better place
for the exercise could be imagined than
an institute of applied economics at a
university. Having the only one of
those in the country, Melbourne has
geared itself to the job under erstwhile
Scotsman, 50-year-old Professor Ronald
F. Henderson. His institute’s new
quarterly, to see the light of day in
April and to be called “The Australian
Economic Review” (a pilot issue has
recently been floating around and
creating much interest in business
circles) is also to try its hand at fore-
casting economic and business condi-
tions. But its main forte looks to be
to take a quite objective look at the
quarterly national accounts. Most of the
supporting articles will come from the
dozen or so economists on the stgff
R. F. Henderson
Frank O’Neill
and will project the results of their
full-time labors on applied economics.
Apart from the study on poverty in
Australia, not all that much has reached
the public from Professor Henderson’s
economic house; he makes no apologies
for that, because, in the five years of
its building, solid work has been done.
As well as the new quarterly, new books
on the capital market, the building
industry, and the research and invest-
ment aspects of Australian manufac-
turing industry are coming to the boil.
Less advanced is a study of the Aus-
tralian minerals industry. Henderson,
who has a Ph.D., left a lecturership at
Cambridge University (he was once
an undergraduate at Clare College) to
start up the institute and, going back
a few years, was a captain in the Black
Watch during World War 11.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
An advancing
economy and
immigration
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IF, AS IT CERTAINLY IS, it is right
that the expansion of the Australian
economy is vitally dependent on a
strong flow of immigrants, firms who
get a call from an officer of the Depart-
ment of Labor and National Service
asking how many immigrants they can
guarantee jobs to should ask him in
and talk turkey. For, in future, as has
been made abundantly clear by the
Department of Immigration, which has
enlisted the services of its brother de-
partment to canvass industrial and com-
mercial concerns, the guarantee of
jobs will be crucial to the overall suc-
cess of the immigration program.
Nobody here should need any remind-
ing, especially employers, that without
a strong flow of immigrants into the
workforce, the development of the
economy will hang fire, even given the
revelation of new natural resources and
a greater availability of capital. For this
reason one feels that the guaranteed-job
angle could well be plugged more
adroitly than it is, say, by a nationwide
circularisation of employers, not just
by a sales force from the Department
of Labor and National Service. One
understands, however, that the Depart-
ment has some plans afoot to get out
a brochure which will outline a definite
scheme for the consideration of all
employers.
WE HAVE TO FACE IT, potential
immigrants are becoming increasingly
choosy, and one is not speaking here of
the really touchy ones who fly home in
a matter of a couple of days after sam-
pling the searing heat of an occasional
summer’s day in Melbourne. For one
thing, we can’t get nearly so many of
what might be called “instant immi-
grants” any more. The Department of
Immigration will tell you that it now
takes about nine months, after alerting
a British immigrant that a passage
awaits him, before he’s likely to be
ready to get aboard, whereas in the
good old Calwell days the London pubs
were full of lads and lassies from Lan-
cashire killing time awaiting boats
(nowadays more than half British im-
migrants come by aircraft, belonging
mostly to Qantas, so at a minimum of
costs to our overseas funds).
Although a flurry of applicants fol-
lowing devaluation has slightly im-
proved the Department’s prospects in
Britain, it has now realised it was plac-
ing too much reliance on that country
for getting its target numbers. In the
past three financial years it relied on
Britain to provide 70,000 out of its
target total of 90,000 assisted immi-
grants, whereas of the same overall
figure of assisted immigrants (90,000
out of the total of 148,000 target) only
55,000 are expected to come from
Britain.
WITH THE BRITISH, for one reason
or another, getting more choosy (one
doesn’t have to go all the way with
last week’s leader in “The Australian”
to explain this), the Department of
Immigration has had to turn increas-
ingly to Europe, where, thanks to the
remarkable improvement in the
mobility of labor since the Common
Market was joined, it now considers
it has an excellent potential source of
candidates among the so-called “guest
workers” who have crossed their own
country frontiers to work elsewhere in
Europe. The big point about these
workers is that most of them have been
recruited for work on the basis of offers
of specific employment in the countries
they’ve gone to. So, argues the Depart-
ment, if this source is to be tapped
successfully by Australia it will have
to be on the same basis of guaranteed
employment here.
The Department is pretty confident
that, backed by various new arrange-
ments for assisting Europeans, good
results will follow, provided employers
here do their part. Apparently there
are more than four million of these
“guest workers” in Europe. Generally
they leave their families at home when
they, go to other countries to work.
The Department argues that once these
workers have tasted a different way
of life and a higher standard of living
outside their own countries, then it
shouldn’t be so difficult to attract them
to Australia to settle permanently with
their families. Indeed, the argument
looks sound, because this year about
12,000 of these workers together with
their dependents will arrive here. That
is a good start, though it will make
hardly a dent on the huge numbers of
migrant workers throughout Europe.
An officer of the Department ex-
plained in Melbourne recently that,
although the new drive to get more
European immigrants was aimed
principally at the “guest worker,” the
new arrangements for subsidising pas-
sages were applicable to Europeans of
many nationalities. The cost of pas-
sages per head for selected migrants
over 19 years old is only $25 a head,
while children are brought out entirely
at the expense of the Australian Gov-
ernment. The Department has spread
its net of offices or “missions” in-
creasingly widely in Europe to gather
in this valuable human harvest for
Australia, the latest being set up in
Yugoslavia and another will shortly be
established in Turkey. Behind all this
it mounts a vast publicity program<
and recently has simplified application
procedures. But the trump card really
lies with Australian industrial employ-
ers in lining up jobs to attract the
immigrants. In 1966-67 only seven
hundred of the European immigrants
entering Australia knew the precise
jobs they were coming to. The rest
came on the so-called “open place-
ment” basis. In future, says the Depart-
ment, the latter will simply not be
good enough.
So, for the future advancement of
the Australian economy, employers will
have to line up with the Department
of Immigration in this matter, in a
much more conscientious manner than
they’ve done so far. To spur them on
to better efforts they should read the
article in “Migration and the Future”
in the latest issue of the National
Bank summary of business conditions,
which spells out the advantages of
immigration as well as pointing to some
of the pitfalls. It also advances a line
of thought about the consequences for
the economy if we fail in our efforts
to increase the workforce through a
maximum immigration effort.
“IN THIS PRESENT era of our com-
munity’s life,” the bank says, “when
full employment is virtually the con-
stant rule, it is of great import-
ance that the numbers in the work-
force should rise substantially each
year. In fact it is vital that the work-
force should not only grow at a rapid
rate but that this rate should never
fall behind the growth in employment
opportunities. Theoretical perfection
might envisage an exact balance be-
tween the two, but in the practical
world, as we currently know it, such
perfection is unattainable and the pre-
servation of general stability requires
that, at the very least, there should %e
no overall shortage of labor.
“It must be obvious to all that by
far the best way of maintaining this
situation is by ensuring that migration
makes the maximum possible contri-
bution to enlarging the workforce,
rather than having resort to restrictive
measures on business and industry
designed to lower the demand for
labor. If folio vved, the path of
restriction could lead only to stag-
nation, because in many respects it
would be equivalent to attempting to
progress in a society whose population
was declining. Many will remember
that for a lengthy period we in’ Aus-
tralia were perilously near this position
prior to World War 11. And surely
nobody would want to even remotely
approach those days again.”

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Out go some
of the
mining stocks
AN AMERICAN gave me this one:
Three Red Indian squaws slept on
three different kinds of skins,
The first squaw slept on elk skin,
The second squaw slept on buffalo
skin,
The third squaw slept on hippo-
potamus skin,
Later on they all had babies,
The first squaw had a daughter,
The second squaw had a son,
The third squaw had twins.
The moral? The squaw on the hippo-
potamus is equal to the sum of the
squaws on the other two sides.
A company that looks a moral for
better things is Cresco Fertilizers
(W.A.). As its name indicates, it
makes fertilisers. Like Cockburn
Cement, which was mentioned last
week, this company is another one from
the go-go State, Western Australia. This
factor is pertinent for two reasons, and
firstly because Western Australia seems
to be recovering from its drought at a
rather faster rate than the other States.
Incidentally it was the drought that
robbed the fertiliser stocks of their
glamor position on the market about
two years ago. The second reason why
it will pay Cresco (W.A.) to be out
“West” is that the people out that way
seem to have a much larger appetite
for fertilisers than many of their
Eastern cousins. The opening up of
hundreds of square miles of farming
land and such projects as the Ord River
Scheme will ensure that this appetite
continues to grow. A grazier I met the
other day mentioned that “the Yanks
are pouring as much as they can get
into the place.” With such well-known
and well-heeled people as Art Link-
letter, ,of “Kids Say the Funniest
Things” fame, and the King Ranch
people running around the place, his
statement mightn’t be far off the mark.
Cresco (W.A.) hasn’t been idle over
past years either. Since 1959 sales
have increased yearly and, as would be
expected, the added activity in the State
of recent years has accelerated the
process. To handle the extra business
coming in and expected to come in, the
company is erecting a new superphos-
phate plant and a sulphuric acid plant
which will double existing capacity. At
a current price of $2.60 the shares look
good value, especially when you re-
member that in 1966 they were selling
for $3.15. At that stage profit was
$321,000 and the earning rate was 17
percent. Today’s profit (1966-67, that
is) is $519,000 and the earning rate is
27.6 percent. Another comforting
factor about Cresco (W.A.) is that it is
indirectly controlled by W. R. Grace,
the world’s largest fertiliser manufac-
turers. Being keen on getting with the
strength, I purchased 200.
Another company that’s worth getting
with sometime during the next week is
Western Mining. This is not because
of any fresh news about nickel strikes
but merely because of a technicality.
On February 23 the company will split
its shares five ways. Instead of having
50-cent shares valued at around $5O (a
mere hundred times par), the company
will have 20-cent shares valued at
around $lO. The move will bring the
shares into a more popular price range
and (providing the mining market
holds) could offer a chance for quick
profits.
Profitwise, Grimley, the motor parts
people, should be better off this year.
As mentioned last week, new vehicle
registrations were up every month in
1967. As a distributor of automotive
accessories it seems reasonable that
Grimley would have shared some of the
cop. Selling at $1.60, yielding 9.4
percent, and having an asset backing of
close to $4.00 makes Grimley not so
grim at all. Unfortunately, limited
turnover makes this stock an invest-
ment situation rather than a trading
one.
Working on the basis that you can’t
go wrong taking a profit, and being
uncertain as to which way the mining
market will go, I sold off most of my
mineral stocks during the week. Out
went Westralian Oil, Thiess, and BHP;
they earned $l2, $796, and $BB respec-
tively.

Don’t forget all that iron ore
MINING • SHARE LIST ® BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
NICKEL AND OIL are well and truly
the guts of the current boom, and both
seem to be in pretty sound health. But
the market should spare a thought for
what is happening in iron ore, the
metal that sparked the boom off in the
first place. Here, all the listed com-
panies are looking pretty strong in the
market, despite this recent warning in
the authoritative “Metals Week”: “In
order to prevent Japan’s current eco-
nomic boom from overheating, the
Government has begun to apply tight
money policies. In light of this rein-
tightening, Japanese steelmakers are ex-
hibiting reluctance to enter into new
long-term purchases. A major steel-
maker told ‘Metals Week’: ‘Prospects
for economic conditions in the next
-couple of years make this not a very
good time for further purchases.’ How-
ever, the mills may make an exception
in the case of the Australian Robe River
project. But where other major projects
are involved ranging from Western
Australia’s Mt. Goldsworthy and Mt.
Newman to Brazil’s Rio Doce the
Japanese are taking a go-slow stance.”
Nevertheless, groups other than the
Robe River operater, Cliffs, are chasing
sales actively, and Cliffs are consider-
ing an attractive Japanese counter-offer,
Mr. Lang Hancock, partner of the Han-
wright Iron Mines development, says
his company has agreed in principle
with Hamersley Iron to use their rail-
way and port facilities for two years to
establish a cash flow on which to build
their own Wittenoom-Mount Lockyer to
Cape Lambert outlet. His partner, Mr.
Peter Wright, has been in Tokyo, Mr.
Hancock reports, negotiating to sell 25
million tons of iron ore over the next
25 years. The scheme would cost $llO
million, of which, on Hanwright plan-
ning, $lOO million would be recovered
in the first 25 years. This, they believe,
could be financed out of loans carrying
Australian bank overdraft interest to be
repaid out of funds as they become
available from the 25-million ton sale.
Hamersley Iron have contracted to
sell 10 million tons of low-grade iron
ore direct to Kobe Steel, against the
usual selling method of going to the
buying cartel of the steel-making com-
panies. Shipments start in mid-19 70,
building up to an annual 800,000 tons
a year. Meanwhile, Goldsworthy have
received a counter-offer to their rela-
tively small proposal made to the car-
tel on behalf of the mills. Fuji Iron and
Steel have offered them, according to
the Japanese trade Press, 11.6 U.S.
cents per unit for 2.5 million tons of
fines of average Fe content 60-62 per-
cent (their offer was for 12 cents) to be
shipped out over five years starting this
year; an additional 10 million tons
would be negotiated later. And last
week the representative of Daniel K.
Ludwig’s Sentinel Mining Co. returned
to Perth from Tokyo, where he dis-
cussed the first shipment from Sentinel’s
Nimingarra deposits. This would entail
29.7 million tons of lump ore at 14.7
cents per unit.
LET’S FACE IT; WMC is the only
really acceptable nickel stock. The
others, with the possible exception of
Great Boulder, all have to prove they
have enough of it to be worthwhile.
“Poseidon is named ‘stock of the
year,’ ” proclaimed Perth’s “Sunday
Times,” based on an Adelaide tip. The
share price had run up from 8 cents
to $1.35 during January on the strength
of negotiations for mineral claims near
Bindi Bindi, in the Western Australian
wheatbelt, more than 100 miles from
the Norseman-Wiluna arc that has
been proved to bear nickel. Shares in
Bamboo Creek have been among the
most active on Perth Stock Exchange
for weeks; the full name, significantly,
is Bamboo Creek Gold Mines N.L.
Replying to a query from the exchange,
the company said it was “negotiating
for an interest in” mineral claims in
the Pilbara. This is 700 miles from
the Kambalda-Kalgoorlie area.
But perhaps the most remarkable
case of burnt fingers was provided by
Hill 50 Consolidated N.L. This com-
pany floated on April Fool’s Day, 1954,
to look into mining around the Hill 50
goldmine; it has no relationship with
the .original Hill 50 company. Hill 50
Consolidated never cracked a goldmine,
but calls went out from time to time,
announced only in the public notices
of the Press, not by personal notices
to shareholders. About November the
word spread that the company was
The Chartist says:
ARDLETHAN TIN N.L. could now be considered a recovery situation on tech-
nical grounds. It is an interesting chart from both trend lines and support
and resistance levels. The market action over the past few weeks has pene-
trated the major downtrend held since the peak early in 1966 and the resistance
level formed at 48c during 1967. A short-term target of about 65c is indicated,
with a further objective of approximately $1.05, where strong resistance would
be encountered from both the 1964/66 range of trading. Last sale price on
8/2/68 —50 c.

interested in nickel and in came the
speculators to push up the share price
from one cent to 30 cents before, in
December, the directors pointed out
nothing definite had happened, although
they would like to find nickel options
within their limited budgets.
This halved the price to 15 cents,
but then many of the original investors
seeking to cut their losses found that
the scrip in their bottom drawers was
worthless. By failing to pay the calls,
they had forfeited their shares. Perth
brokers say that only about one in five
of the shares transacted was fully paid
up. So the non-holder investors had to
rush back into the market to honor
their transactions . . . they had to
buy the stock they wanted to sell. This
pushed the price as high as 62 cents.
Last week Hill 50 Consolidated re-
ported the beginning of negotiations for
the possible acquisition of a number of
mineral claims in the Grant’s Patch
area, 25 miles north-west of Kalgoorlie,
adjoining a Western Mining Corpora-
tion tenement.
THE MARKET has begun to twig to
some of the important implications of
the latest move by' the Western Aus-
tralian beach sands producer Western
Titanium N.L., whose semi-commercial
plant to produce beneficiated ilmenite
will be commissioned this month. This
plant, based in the south-west of West-
ern Australia near Capel, 130 miles
south of Perth, is one with a 10,000-
ton throughput of beneficiated ilmenite.
Ilmenite is a naturally occurring heavy
mineral, which, at Capel, contains
about 56 percent titanium dioxide and
34 percent iron oxides. “Beneficiation”
is a form of upgrading; Western
Titanium want to upgrade the titanium
dioxide content. The beneficiation pro-
cess is similar to that used in the iron
ore industry; in fact, with this process,
plants in Europe and North America
have used ilmenite as a source of iron
ore. The iron oxides are attacked and
converted to iron metal before being
re-oxidised in a fascinating hydro-
metallurgical process, leaving the
titanium dioxide content around 93
percent.
This, then, is “beneficiated ilmenite”
or synthetic rutile. Rutile is another
naturally occurring component of beach
sands, in this case a gemstone with a
titanium dioxide content around 95
percent. It is rarer than ilmenite, hence
the need for a cheap synthetic. A. J.
Gourlay wrote an authoritative cover-
age of this aspect in a recent issue of
the quarterly “Australian Mineral
Industry,” in which he said: “With in-
creased efficiency in mining and treat-
ment methods, and modern handling
and loading facilities, the local industry
is now well placed to take full advan-
tage of increased world demands for
titaniferous ores. As far as demand for
ilmenite is concerned, two facts
emerge: first, that titanium dioxide pig-
ments will continue to provide the main
outlet for ilmenite and for some years;
and, secondly, that, although the bulk
of world supplies of titanium dioxide
pigments will continue to be produced
by the sulphate process (based on
ilmenite and Sorel-type slag), an in-
creasing proportion of world pigment
output will result from the chloride
process using rutile as the preferred
raw material. Domestic producers
should therefore investigate the possi-
bilities of producing an economic, com-
mercial grade of synthetic rutile which
will provide an additional outlet for
ilmenite, and thereby enable ilmenite
to supplement, indirectly, demands
made on natural rutile, particularly in
the fields of pigment manufacture,
welding-rod coatings, and titanium
sponge production.”
This is exactly what Western
Titanium have done. After research
that began as soon as they set up in
1954, they believe they have made
what their plant manager, Mr. Peter
Nairn, calls a most significant break-
through with the help of, first, the
Government Chemical Laboratories,
and, more recently, the CSIRO, with
whom they have patented the new pro-
cess. Their next move would be to step
up throughput tenfold, into the 100,000-
ton stage of beneficiated ilmenite. If
this happens—and they are confident it
will—profitability could be expected to
improve 200-300 percent. Meanwhile,
the semi-commercial plant, soon to start
operating, is an achievement in itself.

It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

The Melbourne market
The speculator's
paradise
IT’S BEEN A BLACK week for Col-
lins Street farmers, some of them, any-
way, including Mr. C. T. Looker, chair-
man of the Melbourne Stock Exchange,
whose property was badly scorched, if
not thoroughly blackened in places, by
the bushfires. As compensation, per-
haps, when the Sydney Stock Exchange
computer couldn’t stand the strain of
the huge volume of business one day
during the week, Melbourne brokers
got the overspill—which, by the way,
shows how wise the local committee
was to wait and see how Sydney’s com-
puter performed before installing one
itself. Not that it would have bought
one, though, until the new stock ex-
change building is ready to house it,
which could be quite soon, judging by
outside appearances of the tall poppy
which puts the poor Collins House pro-
perly in the shade.
The market was a speculator’s para-
dise last week. By that is meant not
that everything has been going up in
escalator fashion, rather that prices,
especially of the favorite speculative
counters, have been jumping up and
■down in such a delightful way that
the in-and-out boys have been having
the time of their lives. It is an
ideal situation for the covered bear,
just as it is for anybody operating on
a flimsy margin and those who are
relying on brokers never quite catch-
ing up with their transfer traffic
(something that the Post Office strike
gave a lot of speculators a head start).
In these circumstances the spate of in-
terim reports from industrial com-
panies,, good though most of them were
(with the Melbourne “Herald” all too
ready to acclaim profit buoyancy in the
absence of any figures in substantia-
tion), has fallen on the market more
as water on a duck’s back than as solid
grist to the trading mill.
Nor is it just a question of the mar-
ket failing to take the full measure of
account of company reports. It seems
highly incapable at the moment of
giving the respect that is due to news
from anywhere, so one-track-minded
toward minerals shares it has become.
Obviously it isn’t in the mood to read
the worst into the Allied disasters in
South Vietnam, let alone the remark-
able new figures for the growth of
leasing business by the finance com-
panies issued by the Commonwealth
Statistician and given full interpretative
coverage in the main national dailies
during the week. The latter figures
also happen to appear on the same
morning as the outstandingly good
interim from Mutual Acceptance and
the somewhat less exciting result from
Beneficial Finance, which alone might
well in other circumstances have ex-
cited somebody’s appetite for finance

company shares of some sort or other,
especially after the lead The Bulletin
gave into them last week.
But not a bit of it. As a matter
of fact, sales of finance companies were
few and far between in Melbourne
after this news on Friday and, albeit
it being a second room stock, none at
all in Mutual Acceptance, which is
currently offering a yield of nearly
1\ percent. Nor indeed was anybody
nibbling at bank shares with the hope
that the merger bug which has bitten
Barclays, Lloyds, and Martins in
Britain could easily get to work here
also with its eyes on the considerable
economies in branch banking seem-
ingly crying out to be reaped. Nobody
seemed to notice also that the trading
banks announced on Friday afternoon
that their lending spree continued well
into January.
The bank merger scheme may have
failed to stir chords here, but two other
news items from Britain certainly did.
One was the rather general one that
Mr. Roy Jenkins made no mention of
cutting private portfolio investment in
Australia by British residents and in
fact gave permission for any holders of
Western Mining shares to take up their
rights in the new issue. This had a
stimulating effect on our market, how-
ever illogical it may seem in the con-
text of the Chancellor’s other recent
edicts. In the absence of anything
flowing into the market from the U.S.
It is all the more to be applauded by
Australian investors who have, a little
gallingly, been led by the hand from
London, especially in mining shares,
lately.
There was a bit of selling of Davies
Coop on Friday after it was learnt that
their erstwhile suitor, the prince of
Viyella, Mr. Joe Hyman, was flashing
$214 million or so in the face of English
Sewing Cotton, a much bigger fish to
fry than theirs, in which Viyella still
has a 29 percent (and slightly under
25 percent voting) stake. At this stage
there appear to be no implications,
obvious or otherwise, for Davies Coop,
whose shares have held up remarkably
well since the full Viyella bid flopped
and whose interim (due mid-February)
is expected to be good.
However, one hears that nothing is
likely to come from Viyella’s bid for
English Sewing Cotton (which owns
Tootal Broadhurst, the Tasmanian
weaver here) simply because negotia-
tions for a merger between ESC and
Calico Printers’ Association have been
proceeding for some time and will prob-
ably be consummated in a deal (CPA’s
interest here is ACTIL in Adelaide).
As for Viyella making another attempt
to get Davies Coop, it has to be remem-
bered that the devaluation of sterling
means that it would have to find
another 7 cents a share to meet its
previous offer in Australian currency
and convince the U.K. Treasury it
could get this back in profits.

Security analysis
Selbys for the long term
ONE OF THE DISTURBING fea-
tures of Australia’s manufacturing in-
dustry over recent years has been the
very slow rate of increase in produc-
tivity. In the 19605, the Australian rate
of increase in productivity of manu-
facturing industry has been well below
four percent a year and we rank last
on the international table of leading
countries in the non-communist world,
very far behind Japan, and also behind
the Netherlands, Sweden, France, Bel-
gium, U.S.A., West Germany, Canada,
South Africa, Switzerland, and the
down-but-not-out United Kingdom.
That should be a sobering thought for
all Australian investors to ponder at a
time when the fevered “nickel rush” of
1968, the intense hunt for minerals and
the mining speculation surrounding it
have tended to push all other considera-
tions aside. If Australia is to become,
one day, more than just a quarry or
farm and turn into a major manufactur-
ing power with the ability to sell sophis-
ticated equipment in quantity on world
markets, the real wealth is still to be
found in new combinations of better
machinery and technology, better orga-
nisation, better management, and better
all-round working skills.
Australian industry as a whole has
always been too prone to buy ready-
made know-how from overseas, rather
than undertake local research and de-
velopment. If full advantage is now
taken of the new tax incentives provided
by the Industrial Research and Develop-
ment Grants Act 1967, we may one day
see an Australian research revolution
and a speeded up rate of technological
progress.
One of the major building-blocks to
help create a more go-ahead Australian
manufacturing industry is in the use
and development of new and better
measuring instruments to provide
the scientist with more accurate, more
versatile, and more rapid means of
determining his findings. These instru-
ments play an even greater role in
industry beyond the laboratory, not only
in quality control in areas of product
inspection and testing, but in being
harnessed in the factory as automated
process-control equipment, which be-
comes part of the manufacturing pro-
cess itself. This cross-pollination
between science and industry in the
interchange of instruments has led
overseas to many feedbacks, to new
experiments, new discoveries, and new
industrial innovations.
H. B. Selby Australia Ltd. is one of
the largest distributors in Australia and
New Zealand of precision instruments
for scientific and industrial uses, and
these products account for over 55
percent of group annual turnover. The
balancing 45 percent of Selby’s annual
turnover is made up of more tradi-
tional laboratory apparatus, equipment,
and supplies, including glassware and
laboratory metalware, together with
analytical and industrial chemicals, and
a host of sundry items. Selbys have
been traditionally for over 60 years
Australia’s largest distributor of general
laboratory apparatus and supplies. I
was told that, since becoming a public
company in 1949, Selby’s group sales
have increased by an average of 75 per-
cent every four years. Another instance
of rapid increase in turnover was cited;
it was said that in the ten-year period
from 1949 to 1959 the company rang
up more than three times as much
turnover as was received in the previous
49 years of its existence.
The Selby story opens with Mr. H. B.
Selby, who, having sought his fortune

discoveries which had opened up at
Kalgoorlie in the laite 1890 s, became
a partner ip 1903 in the laboratory
supply -business of a Mr. de Beer. De
Beer hid started a small business in
Melbourne in 1900 importing labora-
tory glassware from Germany. Selby
married his partner s sister and bought
out his new brother-in-laws interest. A
branch was opened in Sydney in 1912,
but as early as 1904 Mr. Selby had paid
his first visit to Europe to make per-
sonal contact with suppliers. Personal
contact with suppliers has been a key
factor in the success of this company
ever since.
During World War II the company
became a manufacturer for the first
time, turning out analytical weights in
Sydney. A separate factory was opened
in St . Leonards (Sydney) in 1948, and
a duplicate factory in Melbourne in the
early 19505. The company produced
i n quantity laboratory metalware and
custom-built scientific glass equipment,
Further distribution branches were
started in Brisbane (1949), Perth
M9SP. Adelaide M952L Hobart
(1958), and, with the acquisition of
Geo. W. Wilton Ltd., in 1962, the
Selby business was extended to Welling-
ton and Auckland (New Zealand).
There are three Mr. Selbys in the
company today, two of whom are sons
of the founder. The founder himself
died in 1937. However, family in-
fluence is played down and the company
prides itself on its professional manage-
ment.
The manufacturing division, Analite,
represented about ten percent of group
total employment of 363 in 1967 and
contributed about seven percent of
group turnover. In addition to general
laboratory and scientific apparatus,
Analite produces demonstration and
teaching equipment, including
“Mil-Sel” equipment produced in
association with Professor Julius Sum-
ner Miller of the TV program “Why is
it So” fame.
On a group turnover basis, the Sydney
and Melbourne (including Hobart)
offices are said to be about equal in
size, each contributing about two-
sevenths of the total sales volume,
Brisbane provides one-seventh of group
turnover, Perth/Adelaide, between
them, another one-seventh, and the
balancing one-seventh is made up from
the New Zealand branches. Of total
sales, my information is that slightly
less than half are made to private in-
dustry and private colleges, the balance
to government departments and govern-
ment-controlled hospitals, universities,
and institutions. The most dynamic
area of growth has been in sales to
industrial users.
It will be seen that the main empha-
sis in a business such as this is in its
ability to sell equipment to very spec-
ialised users. About one-quarter of the
employment force are salesmen and a
significant proportion of them have
tertiary training and specific training
in overseas scientific instrument houses.
Backing the salesmen is an equal team
in numbers, employed as service
engineers, assemblers, packing staff,
and truck drivers, while the balance of
the staff is employed in the factories or
in administrative positions. Wages and
salaries are said to have represented
12.3 percent of group turnover in 1967.
There has been a recent invasion of
U.S. scientific and process - control
equipment companies, who have
opened their own Australian sales
offices. The U.S. companies, which had
previously operated here through Aus-
tralian agents, included Varian Associ-
ates (Selbys were their agents), Perkin-
Elmer Corporation, and Hewlett-
Packard Company. The combined
world sales of these three companies in
1966 exceeded SA4OO million. Although
the American companies, with their
own sales outlets in Australia, have
affected adversely the fortunes of some
Australian-owned distribution houses,

them was only small. The Varian
agency associated the Selby company
with the sales of prestigious equipment,
but profit margins were only small
and the influence on profits from the
loss of this agency were of no great
significance. Selby’s hold the important
Beckman Instrument agency and, with
over 150 agencies, have a wide field
of marketable items to help cushion
any drop in turnover or profit should
any other agency be lost.
With the technical upgrading in the
type of equipment for sale, it has be-
come necessary to open new premises
more suitable for the personalised
technical selling and servicing condi-
tions of today. In December, 1966,
Selbys opened a new 38,000 sq. ft. Mel-
bourne office, combining sales and
warehouse facilities, large demonstra-
tion laboratory, technical laboratory,
and instrument service department on
the same site as the Analite, Melbourne
factory. The choice of the new Mel-
bourne location at Notting Hill, 11
miles from the centre of the city, was
carefully thought out, being close to
Monash University, CSIRO labora-
tories, and the dense Clayton and Dan-
denong factory areas. The cost of this
venture was in the vicinity of $400,000.
The premises of Swanston Street, Mel-
bourne, which had been occupied by
the company since 1922, were closed
down.
New premises were also opened in
Brisbane in 1966. In 1968, Selbys will
move their Sydney premises from York
Street to North Ryde, near the Mac-
quarie University. A 40,0005 q. ft. com-
plex will be established, with a similar
layout to the Melbourne premises. The
Sydney Analite factory will also be
housed at North Ryde. The area has
been zoned to be made available only
to industries, which have an affinity
with the university. Selbys will be join-
ing a group of companies mostly en-
gaged in electronics and communica-
tions, such as AW A, Racal Electronics,
and RCA. The medical equipment firm
of Watson Victor Ltd. is also in the
neighborhood.

There was a downturn of 12.7 percent
in profit between 1966 and 1967. This
was the first profit decline in the com-
pany history since 1951 and was said
to be due primarily to non-recurring
expenses incurred in the relocation of
the Melbourne and Brisbane branches.
Apart from this lapse from grace, in
1967, the indicators point to an annual
growth of more than ten percent in
assets, earnings, and earnings per share.
From what I have heard, the 1968
profit should show a return to the pat-
tern of increased earnings, consistent
with the historical trend for this com-
pany.
SUMMARY:
Two years ago in The Bulletin
(April 24, 1965), the solid merits of
H. B. Selby were recommended with
the suggestion to “Buy ’Em and Forget
’Em,” that is, to put them away for
the long-term. This is definitely a stock
for long-term holding and is popular
with institutional shareholders. Since
the beginning of 1968, the 50 cent
shares in Selbys has slipped from $l.lB
to a current $l.lO, reflecting the lack
of trading support for industrial shares,
at a time when speculation for mining
shares is at fever point. The current
dividend yield is 5.5 percent and the
shares are selling for the equivalent of
13.9 times earnings. In my book, Selby
is a growth stock in a growth industry.

Mining
Buying (and selling) from London
IN RECENT WEEKS local shares, and
in particular mining shares, have been
subject to a very high level of interest
from London. In circumstances such
as this the effect of the closing and
opening of London brokers’ trading
accounts assumes a significance perhaps
not realised by some local share buyers.
Whereas in Australia the rule (more
honored in the breach than in the obser-
vance?) is that payment for shares is
due on receipt of the broker’s contract
note, in London purchasers of shares
have up to 14 days to decide whether
they intend paying for the shares they
buy and having them registered into
their name, or whether, in view of sharp
price rises, it would be better to sell
out and avoid having to pay for them
at all. Brokers’ accounts are settled
on a fortnightly basis and, in an active
mining market particularly, this means
that purchases which have been made
(on credit) at the beginning of one
account period are more likely to be
liquidated toward the end of that period
than, say, at some time during the next
account period. The effect this has
depends on how many short-term
operators are holding a particular share,
and whether that share is highly rated
to continue rising. But in general the
system can have the effect that specu-
lative stocks will be under less buying
pressure in the last few days of the two-
weekly account period, as there then
remains only a very short time for
“free” trading.
In view of the heavy London buying
in the past week or so, it may be more
than coincidental that our mining
market weakened noticeably on Feb-
ruary 7 last when the Sydney Stock
Exchange index fell almost ten points.
The London account closed on the Bth
and, during the two or three days prior
to this date, buyers interested in shorter-
term positions would be very scarce and
holders, especially those showing a good
paper profit on recent transactions,
would become nervous following the
rapid rises which had taken place in
those shares traded between here and
London. When a new account opens
the reverse can be expected, with
traders in London willing to be more
active in purchasing stock and sellers
much less in evidence.
Coincidental with the final days of
the last London account, the influential
English “Financial Times” suggested
that high prices for Australian shares
are unlikely to be sustained in the event
of further restrictions on the flow of
TJ.K. money abroad; the same com-
mentator also suggested that the time
had come to treat Western Mining
shares with caution.
There have, of course, been other
occasions on which a note of caution
has been sounded by market commen-
tators, but this latest warning is rather
more credible than others which have
questioned the market’s valuation of
this or that company’s earnings or pros-
pects, as these things are matters of
fashion more than probability. The
popularity of many shares in recent
weeks has, however, relied on several
factors, the continuance of which can
by no means be assumed.
The “Financial Times” reminds us
that there is a very real possibility that
the flow of sterling funds out of Britain
may be restricted even more than it is
now. The alacrity with which U.K.
investors appear to be purchasing local
(mining) shares itself suggests that they
rate this possibility rather higher than
do their Australian counterparts. Both,

however, are somewhat influenced by
world liquidity problems; the U.K.
investors being spurred on by the
troubles surrounding their own cur-
rency, while local investors are perhaps
more susceptible to suggestions that the
price of gold is virtually certain to
rise, perhaps double, in the fairly near
future.
On this premise, stocks like Peko-
Wallsend have found very strong sup-
port from brokers and investment ser-
vices alike. On a gold price of SU.S.7O
per ounce (currently $U.5.35), Peko’s
earnings in a couple of years have been
variously estimated as high as $13.7
million in 1968-69 and $16.3 million in
1971. With 11-odd million shares out-
standing after the acquisition of over
90 percent of Mount Morgan’s ordinary
capital, these figures do provide ample
justification for recommending Peko
shares. But the assumption that an
increase in the price of gold is virtu-
ally certain is a basic part of these
estimates, and while world monetary
authorities are doubtless making every
effort to prevent such an increase, pros-
pective purchasers of such shares could
well pose the question: are current
prices for Peko justified in the event
that the price of gold remains un-
changed?
This question becomes even more per-
tinent when combined with others—
such as will the company’s Juno ore-
bodies be mined at a rate of 40,000
tons per annum following the increases
in reserves of this mine, or will the
company choose to extend its three-four
year life by maintaining production at
the planned rate of 23,000 tons a year
and by so doing minimise annual depre-
ciation and amortisation charges?
Peko produces copper as well as gold,
and production of this metal will in-
crease in a few years’ time when the
company begins extracting ore from its
Warrego mine. The various estimates
of Peko’s likely earnings in years ahead
have been based on a local price of
$7OO per ton, equivalent to £stg.32s.
Such a figure does appear quite realistic
with copper, at present closer to
£stg.7oo per ton, and the British Metal
Corporation has recently predicted that
the previously accepted minimum price
of £stg.3oo per ton is probably no
longer acceptable as a base price in view
of rising costs and devaluation, and that
1969 will probably see prices approach
£stg.4oo. It is quite firm that once
the American strikes are over, copper
prices will move appreciably lower.
For all these reasons present prices
for shares like Peko, and even Western
Mining, must attract a declining
number of bolder investors for, whether
or not profit projections are close to
the mark, it still makes good sense to
buy mining shares when metal prices
are low and prospects of such things
as gold price rises are distant, and
become a seller when metal prices are
high and prospects very rosy.

Uranium hopes
OF ALL THE IRRATIONAL valua-
tions which have settled on Australian
mining stocks over the past few weeks,
those of uranium, originally boosted by-
tipsters and bullish brokers’ circulars at
the beginning of the year, demand par-
ticular reappraisal by price-setters.
Not that a rising world demand in
the 1970 s and widening supply-
demand gap in the 1980 s can be
denied. Indeed, in the U.S.—the pace-
setter of the nuclear power game—the
cumulative 250,000 tons of uranium re-
quired up to 1980, as predicted by the
Atomic Energy Commission and so
enthusiastically publicised here, is put
closer to 330,000 tons by the industry.
These are both impressive figures, with
known U.S. uranium reserves exploit-
able at a price of SU.S.B per pound
estimated at 148,000 tons at the end of
last year.
But nobody knows what new dis-
coveries may be made by then, and
local speculation on the subject has re-
mained more or less blind to the unpre-
cedented prospecting activity in other
parts of the world.
U.S. activity has also spread to Aus-
tralia. Western Nuclear, of Denver, is
carrying out field work on the leases of
Queensland Mines at Anderson’s Lode
(reserves of 2280 short tons) and Skal
(660 short tons) with an option, expir-
ing next April, to become an equal
partner in any commercial develop-
ment. Western Nuclear have also taken
an 85 percent interest in United
Uranium and will finance all prospect-
ing expenditures in a 5600 square mile
area of Arnhem Land, Northern Terri-
tory.
A subsidiary of the Newmont Cor-
poration of America is also associated
with United Uranium, in a joint ven-
ture which includes EZ Industries and
Peko Mines, with the announced inten-
tion of investing $1.2 million in “ex-
ploration and development of uranium
and other minerals” at United
Uranium’s South Alligator and Pan-
danus Creek areas in the Northern
Territory (total reserves of 480 short
tons).
What the present high level of Aus-
tralian uranium stocks reflects, in part,
is some recovery, at least, from the
demoralising effects of the so-called
Fairbairn “incentive” of export restric-
tions imposed on uranium last April.
There is a chance that Queensland
Mines, United Uranium, and MKU (at
present prospecting 975 square miles
surrounding its leases, total reserves of
7670 short tons, at Mary Kathleen,
Queensland) will upgrade their reserves
through the current exploration pro-
grams. But whether the capital re-
quired for an extensive search, let alone
extensive mining, will put in an appear-
ance while the export restrictions
remain in their present form is a moot
point.

THE LAND
Big Chief Rainmaker
BRAVE MR. HANNAY! Apart from
accepting responsibility each day for
tomorrow’s weather forecast as regional
director (Victoria) of the Bureau of
Meteorology, he has gamely predicted
the end of the severe drought in south-
eastern Australia. He believes that rain-
fall this autumn will be average or even
better than average. His confidence is
based on rainfall probabilities derived
from a study of records stretching over
111 years by the Melbourne office of
the Met. Bureau. The only “out” he
has allowed himself is that his forecast
applies strictly only to the Melbourne
area. Projection to any other district,
he says, would not be reliable unless a
correlation exists between its rainfall
record and Melbourne’s. People as far
away as Adelaide, Albury, and Hobart,
who have shared Melbourne’s aridity
over the past year or so, will no doubt
believe that a strong correlation holds.
The drought that gripped the
southern regions of New South Wales,
the south-east of South Australia, and
all of Victoria and Tasmania during
1967 equalled in intensity the cele-
brated drought of 1914. Fortunately its
effects on production have not been
nearly so crippling, largely because what
little rain there was happened to fall at
critical times. After looking back over
his weather maps for Australia for the
past year, Mr. Hannay points out that
the weather pattern that is normal
across the southern half of the continent
during autumn and early winter simply
persisted for the whole year.
But what has happened is past so
far as Victorians are concerned. There
is no drought there right now, except
the normal summer drought of a
Mediterranean-type climate. They are
looking ahead to the new season’s
weather cycle, when great grey rain-
bearing clouds will once again clothe
the skies, as Mr. Hannay has foretold.
In preparation for this time they have
brought down legislation prohibiting
any unauthorised persons from inter-
fering with the clouds. In future,
amateur rainmakers, including, presum-
ably, Aborigines, who hold rainmaking
corroborees, and perhaps also those who
pray to the white man’s God for rain,
will risk a year’s jail or a $lOOO fine.
And if they persist after a ministerial
order to desist, they can be fined at the
rate of another $lOOO a day for the
period of their intransigence. Instead,
Victoria is to have official rainmakers
protected by Government decree and
directed by the Department of Agri-
culture, which has formed a special
Agricultural Aviation Section to con-
duct the ceremonies.
The Rainmaking Control Act does
not stipulate the exact kind of vest-
ments or skin paint that should be
worn by Victoria’s new shaman, but
it has thought of nearly everything else.
At this juncture .the legislation is prob-
ably unique in the world and may
be adopted as a model by other govern-
ments with strong faith in science.
Under the Victorian Act, insurance
policies and other contracts cannot be
invalidated on the grounds that rain
or hail was allegedly caused by the
official rainmakers. This protection has
been generously extended to official
rainmakers in other States, if and when
they are appointed. Victoria will even
tolerate these new priests operating
within its air space. There are to be
no 12-mile limits and Pueblo incidents
to ruffle Victoria’s spirit of neighborli-
ness. Naturally, the Victorians expect
to be afforded reciprocal rights and
any of their cloud-seeding planes
downed across the border to be
returned immediately and their crews
to be treated with due courtesy and
consideration. This is admittedly asking
a lot of the ardent patrons of the
Berrigan Picnic Race Club, who have
had to abandon their annual meeting
in a cloudburst simply because a bunch
of selfish wheatgrowers south of the
border felt that their crops were getting
dangerously parched and besought the
ministration of their sky priests. How-
ever, the Victorians say that their
“authorised” cloud-seeders will try to
avoid making rain during hazardous
periods and that this is preferable to
a free system permitting false priests
to make rain whenever they felt like
it.
There are paradoxes, true enough
(can anyone be sure that it is possible
to make rain?), but this is an audacious
age and it would seem peevish to com-
plain while the self-seeking Victorians
prepare to rape the sky and its resources
around the globe. Nature, after all,
keeps fairly flexible accounts, insisting
only that a correct balance be main-
tained over time. If the Victorians suc-
ceed in altering one item on the
account, whether men elsewhere
approve or not, we can trust that nature
will compensate by adjusting other
entries in the ledger. Meanwhile, as
the southern farmers dole out their last
wisps of conserved fodder, we can only
hope that Mr. Hannay is dead right
about the autumn break.

Gems as investment
INVESTORS, seeking to diversify or
just seeking the thrill of a new gamble,
have already moved into the com-
mercial art galleries. The next move
may be into the jeweller’s shop. Just
as paintings may give pleasure and
profit, so gemstones can line your
pocket while they adorn your fingers.
Australians have not traditionally
been spectacular jewellery buyers. In
many countries jewellery is one of the
first evidences of conspicuous spending,
but here a country woman will take a
couple of miles of fencing-wire in
preference to a diamond bracelet or
a businessman will buy a motor-boat
rather than a diamond brooch for his
wife.
Not unexpectedly, engagement rings
are the most important part of the
local gem market.
Gems of all kinds have risen sub-
stantially in value over the past five
years. Those which have appreciated
most are rubies, emeralds, opals, dia-
monds, sapphires, and aquamarines, in
that order.
“Although most Australians think of
diamonds when they think of gems,
colored gemstones have risen more
quickly in value,” says Mr. Ken Clarke,
gem expert of Angus and Coote.
Prices are rising, he says, because
of increased world demand, the short-
age of stones offered, and, in some
cases, because of political and currency
problems.
Here is a market guide to some of
the best-known gems:
RUBIES have increased a startling
five times in value in the past five
years. A four-carat ruby bought for
$l5OO in 1963 would now sell for about
$6OOO. Burma is the main source of
supply, but fewer and fewer are com-
ing forward. Rubies also come from
Thailand and Ceylon, but not in great
quantity.
OPALS. Because of increased de-
mand from the United States and
Japan, solid black opals from Lightning
Ridge have rapidly increased in value,
perhaps as much as rubies. Prices for
top-quality solid white opals have
trebled in value in the past five years.
EMERALDS. Most emeralds on the
world market today come from India
and have appreciated in value three
to four times during the past five years.
Columbian emeralds, which are of top
quality and extremely rare, have in-
creased five times in value.
SAPPHIRES and AQUAMARINES
have probably trebled in value over
the past five years.
DIAMONDS. It is harder to make
general calculations about this large
part of the gem market, but most
diamonds have doubled in value over
the past five years.
“The world demand for gem dia-
monds has increased phenomenally
since World War II,” said Mr. Clarke.
“In 1947 sales of gem diamonds
amounted to $44,805,091, but by 1959
they were $139,349,442. Caratage sold
in 1947 was 1.3 million; in 1959 it was
3.1 million.”
Recently the chairman of De Beers,
which controls 85 percent of the world’s
diamonds, said that demand has risen
so much that unless new deposits are
found present sources of supply could
be exhausted by the end of the century.
The gem market is perhaps more
sensitive than most commodity markets
to outside pressures. The war in the
Middle East has already had an effect
on the diamond market. Israel had
established itself as one of the leading
cutting and polishing centres, specialis-
ing in melee (small stones) and pro-
ducing about 30 percent of these stones,
which are used for moderately priced
jewellery.
The war meant that production in
Israel virtually ceased. The London
and Antwerp markets immediately
reacted by a price rise of about five
percent.
The largest single change in attitude
toward gemstones has undoubtedly
been introduced here by immigrants.
Many people in Europe, often prompted
by bitter experience, have for genera-
tions bought diamonds and other stones
to safeguard their savings; many keep
up this form of investment when they
come to Australia. Mr. Clarke believes
they distribute their wealth, as a rule,
in the proportions of one-third real
estate, one-third gems and jewellery,,
and one-third other investments.
World shortage of gems alone won’t
make them a gilt-edged investment.
Investors must be sure of what they
are buying. Perfect stones are extremely
rare, but even a flawed stone can be a
good buy, provided it is bought in full
knowledge of its flaw and the right
price is paid for it.
A large single stone is a better pro-
position than a cluster of small stones.
There is always a ready market for
clear, white diamonds, while yellow
stones are of limited appeal.
Not all gems can be classed as first-
rate investment. Pearls don’t seem to
have the same appeal as gems, and real
pearls are hard to market because cul-
tured ones are so good.
Mining for gemstones in Australia is
still not highly commercialised. A few
larger companies have become involved
in sapphire mining in the New England
district. Lightning Ridge has become
more commercialised lately, but there
are still a lot of people there working
for themselves. Trading is still usually
a casual kind of business conducted in
the local hotel over a can of beer.


Jewellery as
fine craft
JEWELLERY-MAKING is precision
work. However, if you are considering
precious stones as an investment, you
must be sure how much of the value
of your purchase is in the handsome
setting and how much in the stone itself.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
More stunning than stimulating
By DENIS O'BRIEN
Childermas. Thomas Keneally. Old
Tote, Sydney.
WHEN modern drama bewilders you,
the courage you need to voice your
feelings of unhappy incomprehension
often is no farther away than the person
who has been fidgeting and breathing
heavily in the stall next to you. There-
fore, I forgive the critical respiration of
my neighbor during our evening at
Thomas Keneally’s play “Childermas”
for the candor of her opinion which she
dropped into the crowded foyer as we
shuffled out, trying, like cowards, to
lock our tongues over our confusion.
“I can’t understand,” she said, “why
he needed to take all that time and go
to all that trouble over something he
could have said much more simply in a
pamphlet.”
Theatres these days are full of
heretics. Indeed, one Sydney reviewer
has even suggested that Mr. Keneally
should write a program note giving “a
first-hand account of what his play is
all about.” Such a suggestion would be
enough to bring out Messrs. Albee and
Pinter in a rash of allegorical measles.
Judged on its failure to express its
theme coherently, “Childermas” is an
unsatisfactory play. As a second play
from a gifted writer who obviously has
learnt from some of the mistakes of his
first, it has a rightful place in the Old
Tote’s scheme to encourage playwrights
by practical experiment.
“Childermas” is the first production
in a new season of Australian plays at
the Old Tote and has the distinction of
having been commissioned by the Aus-
tralian Committee of Responsibility for
Children of Vietnam. Mr. Keneally has
approached his commission with the
enthusiasm of a professional orator just
recovered from a long bout of laryngitis,
mounting a wordy, ferocious argument
against war and the children it kills.
The trouble is that, by the end, he
hasn’t jerked one new lazy corner of
conscience or said anything fresh to
fortify the common responsibility. His
attack becomes lost in a theoretical fog
produced by his passion.
True, his impressively imaginative
restatement, of the horribly obvious pro-
vides opportunities for several quite
chilling theatrical scenes, revealing, in
the process, an admirable advance from
the wooden technique of his first play,
“Halloran’s Little Boat.” But it is
Keneally’s imagination which ultimately
produces the heavy breathing, for he
lets it run undisciplined into a phantas-
magoria of fact, myth, legend, social
comment, imagery, and symbolism.
It is easy to admire his scholarship,
difficult to follow his convoluted course
to a concluding point which is hardly
in doubt and with which no one is
likely to argue.
“Childermas” is set in an unstated
battleground where a war has been
grinding on for 97 years. Through the
ashes of it all tramp three officers
elected by their troops to find and save
a new-born holy Lama child, the last
of a cycle and whose survival is the only
hope for peace.
Keneally puts his modern Three Wise
Men through a thicket of imagery on
their way to the manger, confronting
them with ordeals by fire and water,
struggles for their faith, corruption,
and, finally, a slaughter of the inno-
cents by a jackbooted Nazi-Big Brother
figure named, with heavy underscoring,
Herod.
Despite its rambling abstractions,
“Childermas” is not a dull play; it is
much too fiercely energetic to be that.
Some scenes —notably one in which the
three officers are coolly, cruelly brain-
washed by Herod and his stooges—are
written with powerful ingenuity and
grip the attention.
But the dialogue demands too much
of its audience. Grab a guideline one
minute and you’re likely to find your-
self hanging out on a limb the next.
Ron Haddrick (top) and John Krum-
mel in “Childermas” at the Old Tote
Keneally’s bombardment of words even-
tually stun more than stimulate.
Director John Clark has assembled
the raw material painstakingly but with
a sort of desperation which shows in
spasmodic overstatements during periods
of clarity. Given another fortnight for
preparation he might have been able
to have built a smoother and more com-
prehensible production.
The acting puzzled me. Not one
actor contributed an indifferent per-
formance; three of them —Ron Had-
drick, Peter Collingwood, and John
Krummel—put down excellent charac-
terisations. Yet the total effect was as

Krummel, Peter Collingwood, Harold Hopkins, Ron Graham, and James Bowles


if the company was being cued by
traffic lights.
This production has attracted a great
deal of practical support from the asso-
ciated arts in Australia. Poets Judith
Wright and James McAuley each has
contributed the words for songs in the
play; Nigel Butterley has set them to
his strangely haunting music.
Mr. Keneally himself currently is
being celebrated as the newest lion of
Australian literature, and with such an
assembly of intellectual talent the whole
experiment is being given vigorous
backing by the academics. The Old
Tote’s fat program for the season drips
with back-slapping and mutual admira-
tion among a certain “in” group.
“Childermas” served to strengthen
my uneasy feeling that, after years as
a neglected child, Australian drama is
being taken closer to an esoteric foster
home which professes to care for it like
none of us. We’re not likely to want in
if we can’t understand what’s going on,
but there will come a time when they’ll
want us. And then where will we be?
Tribal security
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Absence of a Cello. Ira Wallach.
St. Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
McCLUHAN INSISTS that electronic
media are re-tribalising the world. In
this event, the new anthropological
forms are being dictated by the cor-
porations, for it is their advertising
budgets that sustain the media. And, as
everyone from Margaret Mead to
Vance Packard has observed, the cor-
poration is very much tribal in its
structure.
This is never more superannuated
than when an uninitiate is seeking an
admittance to the superannuated
security of the tribe. Before he can take
his place in the bland office-block, he
must demonstrate to the executive
chiefs his unequivocal conformity to
corporate standards and is required
to answer a multitude of cabalistic
questionnaires designed to lay bare his
innermost kink. Only then is he wel-
come in the secret orders of salesman-
ship. Then and only then will he be
able to join, on Monday mornings, in
singing the choral tribute to the Pro-
duct, before venturing with loaded
briefcase into the marketing affray.
Ira Wallach reveals something of the
initiation ceremonies in his comedy
concerning the efforts of a noted but
impecunious scientist to obtain em-
ployment with a major chemical con-
cern. Their motto (or, rather, one of
them) is “Hire fast, job won’t last,
Hire slow, fire no.” So they dispatch
their staff psychologist to check out the
scientist in his domestic environment.
To my eye, the home in question
(as interpreted by designer Kathner)
was impeccably “Saturday Evening
Post.” For although the scientist was
presumably viewed by Wallach as being
something of an outsider, and his wife
was the author of a number of studies
of the Arthurian legends, the only trace
of academic eccentricity on view was
a cello. (Being an introspective instru-
ment, this was unthinkable in corpor-
ate terms, and the play’s title comes
from its symbolic banishment to a
broom cupboard.) As neither the home
nor its occupants seem sufficiently out-
of-step with suburban normalcy, the
production fails to give real edge to
Wallach’s viewpoint. The family needs
more vitality and their environment
cries out for rough edges to emphasise
the spuriousness of their assumed social
smoothness. Of the cast, only Made-
laine Orr and Pat Norman understood
this, and consequently their contri-
butions were by far the most telling.
However, Wallach’s dialogue is fast
and quite fresh, and the evening passes
pleasantly until a note of compromise
is introduced in the denouement. Here
Wallach has the corporation reveal
some quite uncharacteristic subtlety
presumably to prevent any corporation
tribesmen in the audience going home
unhappy.
Dividends from “the you beaut country"
By SANDRA HALL
AMID ALL the despair about the lack
of an Australian film industry, there
are the rare and surprising success
stories.
The latest concerns the rash of low-
budget outback documentaries being
screened in theatres or halls in most
States.
“Wheels Across a Wilderness,” made
by Michael and Malcolm Leyland, has
just ended a 15-week season at the
Palace in Sydney, while Hoyts have
shown two more films, “Northern
Safari” and “Safari into Aboriginal
Country,” at the Ashfield Hoyts, a
theatre the company opens only for
special films, screened in this case on a
split-profit basis.
All have been showing to big houses.
It seems that adventures through “the
you beaut country” still exert as power-
ful a vicarious appeal for the urban
Australian as they ever have.
“Northern Safari” was made by
Keith Adams, a retired engineer from
Western Australia who had never used a
cine-camera before in his life and shot
the film as a series of home movies
during trips from Perth to the Northern
Territory. He began screening it in
halls in Western Australia, then like
the Leyland brothers showed his film
at the Hawthorn Town Hall in Mel-
bourne, where Hoyts representatives
first saw it and became interested.
Adams has retained the full distribu-
tion rights to his film, while the Ley-
lands have sold only limited rights
of “Wheels Across a Wilderness” to
Hoyts, and both groups are planning to
show their films in the United States.
In fact, the Leylands are said to be
considering a lucrative offer from an
American TV network.
They’re professional photographers
from Newcastle who made their film
debuts five years ago with a docu-
mentary, “Down the Darling,” for
the Project series.
“Wheels Across a Wilderness” is the
account of a five-month expedition
across the centre of Australia in 1966
from Steep Point in Western Australia
to Cape Byron, 3000 miles away. A
Sydney businessman backed the venture
with $15,000, and the Leylands were
joined by Michael’s wife, Pat, Keith
Davey, a naturalist who made the
Darling River trip, and Ted Hayes,
who became mechanic for the expedi-
tion.
They used two Land - Rovers, a
motor-cycle, and a homemade supply
trailer, and shot 14,000 feet of color
film without a script.
“None of the expedition members
knew what was going to happen with
each new day,” they say in the
brochure on sale at the Palace during
the film’s run.
Hoyts are pleased, anyway and a
little surprised at the popularity of
these films. “Wheels Across a Wilder-
ness” will now make its way around
Sydney’s suburban Hoyts circuit, and
the Leylands are reported to be think-
ing about their next project • a trip
around the Australian coast in a small
craft.
They’ve already written a book about
the last expedition to be called
“Where Dead Men Lie” and in a
nice footnote to the story are appar-
ently becoming stars of somebody else’s
film. A U.S. television crew is doing a
filmed report on them.

certain interest; but there’s little point
in keeping a film so long that every-
one’s forgotten it ever existed.
“Woman of the Dunes” was widely
discussed in its day and caused a con-
siderable split in critical opinion, but
one doesn’t hear of it too often now.
When I saw it at the Festival a few
years ago it was still a talking point.
I found it pretentious and overblown,
though visually rewarding, and the
lapse of a couple of years has not
altered this opinion. Teshigahara treats
as an allegory of the human condition
the story of a man trapped in a sand-
pit with a woman whose task it is
every day to shovel away the encroach-
ing sand that will otherwise engulf her
and the neighboring village.
Trapped into becoming the woman’s
helper and companion, the man makes
frantic efforts to escape, which be-
come more and more perfunctory;
and finally when the opportunity offers
itself he rejects it. The not over-
subtle philosophical message of the
story is underlined and reiterated to
the point of tedium, and the develop-
ment is ponderous to a degree remark-
able even in a Japanese film, none of
which believe in haste. Even Segawa’s
beautiful black-and-white photography
finally loses its excitement: the lovingly
observed patterns of windblown sand,
and the shifts of emphasis which make
a grain of sand as large as a boulder,
a man as small as an insect, become
less and less exciting through the
director’s constant and calculated
repetition of his effects.
Hopefully billed as “the first big
hit of 1968,” “Nine Lives” was shown
here at least four festivals ago. It
can’t by any stretch of the imagin-
ation be called a cinematic landmark
direction, photography, and acting
are sound and workmanlike, but no
more. It still retains interest because
of the story it has to tell and because
of its understated celebration of some
of the higher qualities in man.
It is the true story no script-
writer would have dared invent it
of the escape of a Norwegian com-
mando into Sweden, in the face of
enemy pursuit, hunger, frostbite, snow-
blindness, and a couple of other
troubles that, you’d think, would per-
suade anyone to give up the whole
attempt and just die. The film pre-
sents without dramatics the story of
a man who could always find just
another reserve of effort, and of the
strangers who risked their own lives to
help him.
Indeed, in his determination not to
overdramatise, the director often uses
understatement to the point of absurdity,
and one gets the impression that the
famous British stiff upper lip simply
isn’t in the race with the Norwegian.
But it’s a heartening, optimistic
movie, and a good, rousing adventure
story, too.
Art
Erotic obsessions
By ELWYN LYNN
Brett Whiteley. Kym Bonython Gal-
lery, Sydney.
IT’S A PITY that Whiteley’s present
show does not include some of the
formidable work from his Marlborough
exhibition late last year, when critics
were so divided that the London “Daily
Telegraph” accused Whiteley of erotic
gimmickry and urged the public not
to fall under his evil enchantment, and
September’s “Apollo,” in a more
balanced view, found his intriguing
obsessions too private to be art or of
universal interest; but it’s clear enough
that Whiteley’s obsessions with, for
example, sex, if not universal, certainly
go beyond transient preoccupations
with bloodless lips, mini-skirts, and per-
vasive permissiveness.
Whiteley’s obsessions have become
more dispersed: he was probably a
more assimilable artist when his theme
and methods were more unified as in
his biomorphic landscapes and his
series on the nude in the bath, Christie
and the zoo. Despite great daubed
patches, drips, drifting bits of collage,
and repetitious scribbling, they had an
elegance and ease that ran counter, for
example, to Christie’s nauseating necro-
philia. What also gave them cohesion
was his pan-biomorphism, as bed, bath,
tubes, buttocks, and breast joined in
happy (the bathtub works) and un-
happy (Christie’s mattresses) union.
Such elements remain, but Whiteley
now has varied sexual and social inter-
ests. Headache , ,a small and not very
successful painting, has an empty beach
topped by a row of Bex packets and
a huddle of caravans; it’s about the
mindless, headless denizens of the
beach and the despoilers of nature, his
sketchy calligraphy and awkward paint
adding to the muddle. (Incidentally,
he includes an Eric Wilson-like Soup
Kitchen of 1958 that shows what he
can do with orthodox painterliness and
how his spatial control has persisted.)
On the fleshy skin of the beach is
growing a three-dimensional, dark
brown mole: a malignant melonoma.
Menace and malevolence lie beneath
the sunniness, the woods, and the sea
in all his work.
Whiteley is an inverted William
Blake; he has Blakean messages writ-
ten into his work; that on Shaving Off
a Second Self sounds like the prophet
himself: “Gentleness overcomes
strength, Fish should be left in the
deep, And sharp weapons of state
Be left where none can see.” If White-
ley seems to be pleading for Blake’s
permissive pacifism, he doesn’t see any
of Blake’s glory in nature and natural-
ness; sex is a nasty fetish itself and
nature’s pleasant surface a delusion.
Sharks, females, trees, beaches all
undergo a perverse, proliferating hybrid-
ism. On Bush-Triptych, he writes:
“What perfumes, what evils lie below
all this green swinging-ringing lazy-
unpredictable, unshaven shapnel (sic)
seen” and using the decorative undul-
ations of art-nouveau he transforms
trees into pink torsos and branches into
phallic tentacles. Such art-nouveau
effects swarm along the top of Solution,
where a swimmer threshes the water
and away down through an ocean as
bare as a minimal painting a fin cuts
its path. (A phallus inserted at the
top obliquely suggests a connection be-
tween cruel death by water, orgasm,
and the terrifying placidity of the sea.)
Eleswhere he is more obsessed by
the world as fleshy exterior: in Beach
the sand becomes a vast area of flesh;
in his New York sketch books (he was
in New York on a Harkness Fellowship
in 1967) he has collage cut-outs of
pink female forms,, to be made into
fibreglass sculpture, surrounded, natu-
rally, by chrome-plated barbed wire.
These sketches are, by the way, rather
unresolved, as though Whiteley found
New York’s impact too shattering;
as Dean Rusk said to the North
Koreans, he should cool it.
Apparently Grandfather (On My
Mother’s Side) with a phallic head
giving off comic-book balloons dealing
with the Australian way of life (that
is, how to pass the time) influenced
his London show, where there was a
similar set of balloons rising from
Brett’s head, but what was new was a
plaster arm reaching across the floor,
almost as funky as anything from Los
Angeles and San Francisco. At
Bonython’s he shows some funky
sculpture a white phallic male shark
and a pair of shark’s jaws for his
female shark, both set on maple-wood
bases that look like sundered Brancusi
pedestals, and a stuffed animal in a
perspex box with a long black tube as
nasty, but fascinating, neck and head.
Even if the six Tangier Postcards, with
collage and drawing and juxtaposing
sharp images with the mysteriously
cluttered, look superficially pleasant
they have a menacing, sinister air quite
different from Hockney, to whom
several are slightly indebted. He has a
curious way of putting a scene under the
microscope and this derives from the
series of isolated images he places as
inserts, sometimes in aperture, along
the top of his paintings; these photo-
graphs, arrows, flowers, and a ULVA
beer glass ought to be harmless, but
they are ingeniously activated by what

happens below; even a simple Klee-
like arrow looks outlandish.
All the above sounds as if we were
being given a pictorial version of the
Gothic novel or Mario Praz’s The
Romantic Agony, but Whiteley records
his obsessions with a volatile, throw-
away elan, as though he half adored
the scungy world through which he

Music
Well-hidden beauty
By PAUL FROLICH
SYDNEY’S 1968 concert season is off
to a good start with the first of the
“Proms”; once again, the Town Hall
is bedecked with greenery, fountains
play, and the floor is packed with
hundreds of youthful listeners in color-
ful array.
The first concert had looked more
exciting in print than it was in the
event; the only piece which could
legitimately arouse enthusiasm was
Peter Sculthorpe’s “Sun Music IV,”
previously heard only in Melbourne.
In essence, it follows on “Sun Music
I,” a success wherever it was heard,
but it is more tightly organised and
of more immediate purpose. It really
is music of here and now, distinctively
Australian, driven by a logic as inexor-
able as that of a Mozart symphony.
As music, it is often hard and harsh,
bird sounds alternate with more threat-
ening ones, but no sound that could be
called disagreeable. Mr. Sculthorpe is
a genuine composer, a man who lives
through the ear and is able to convey
his personal experiences to others.
Szymanovski’s Ist Violin Concerto,
written about 1915, is most distin-
guished by the enormous orchestral
forces employed. The solo violin part,
very ably played by Albert Preston, is
extremely difficult, though unrewarding
otherwise, and the composer’s blend of
Polish themes with the methods of both
Strauss and Debussy is not likely to be
in great demand.
A much happier event was Vaughan
Williams’ Tuba Concerto of 1954. Bril-
liantly played by Cliff Goodchild, it
was easy on the ear, often good fun,
and a remarkable demonstration of the
ponderous instrument’s lyrical scope.
The major disappointment was
Sibelius’ sth symphony. Many people
believe that Sibelius’ symphonies are
endless, dull, and rather pointless.
Though I don’t agree with this, Mr.
Hopkins’ interpretation of what is one
of Sibelius’ less successful works came
close to proving it after all. Sibelius’
music is, in essence, a blend of ice and
fire; in this reading, though there were
traces of ice in the opening movement,
of fire there was none, and all the deli-
cately modulated beauty that I know
lies hidden in the score remained right
there, hidden!


BOOKS
A long look back that might
spur something new
On Native Grounds. Australian Writ-
ing from Meanjin Quarterly. Selected
with a Preface by C. B. Christesen.
Angus and Robertson. $6.
THE PUBLICATION OF this big,
handsome volume seems to me one of
the most important Australian literary
events for a good many years. I don’t
imagine things being what they are
that Angus and Robertson expect
to make any money from it: it repre-
sents a labor of love for the publisher
and C. B. Christesen; probably, they
plan for just one printing. No doubt,
“On Native Grounds” will go into
every institutional, public, and muni-
cipal library worthy to be called one
in this country, as well as into a
number of overseas libraries. But it
deserves to be bought by every in-
dividual reader here with any interest
at all in good writing. The $6.00 price
is reasonable for a book of this size,
especially in view of modern publish-
ing costs.
The anthology is worth buying for
the large poetry section alone: it in-
cludes not merely good poems but some
of the finest ever written in Australia.
I’m thinking particularly of Judith
Wright’s three poems and of those by
James McAuley and Bertram Hig-
gins, but I also rediscovered Randolph
Stow very nearly at his best, Rose-
mary Dobson at her most charming
and elegant, extremely good poems by
Gwen Harwood, R. A. Simpson, and
Vivian Smith, to name just those that
immediately come to mind. Christesen
prints only a few bad poems (even
these could be justified, I suppose, for
historical, commemorative, or personal
reasons). The book contains some
good fiction and excellent literary
criticism: I don’t think the fiction,
except perhaps for Patrick White’s and
Peter Cowan’s contributions, quite
reaches the level of its best poetry.
“Meanjin Quarterly” has published
better criticism than the bulk of what
Christesen uses here: the excellence
arises from the fact that there’s cer-
tainly enough satisfying work by such
critics as Vincent Buckley, R. F. Bris-
senden, and A. D. Hope. Professor
Hope’s 1944 review of Max Harris’
“Vegetative Eye,” for example, re-
tains its freshness and forceful wit in
1968. The biographical material, the
reminiscences, the bits of history that
the sociological commentaries aren’t
all of the highest quality: they reflect
the inevitable ups and downs of a
literary magazine’s regular existence,
perhaps, but they’re never boring, and
they add a diversity of interest to the
prose.
Rex Ingamells’ short manifesto
“Australian Outlook,” with its turn-of-
the-century language and its capitalised
abstractions, has an odd or quaint
interest now, of a kind which its
author, of course, didn’t intend. The
attractive and impressive overall
effect of the book is helped, for in-
stance, by the way that the internal
pages successfully imitate the disinctive
format of Mr. Christesen’s magazine,
even bringing in the decorative line-
drawings, the sketch-portraits, linocuts,
and wood-engravings which are so
much a part of its characteristic appear-
ance.
The magazine has been the best
that we have known in Australia, and
it has never leaned too far forward
toward academicism, as “Southerly”
By ALEXANDER CRAIG
(which is a year older than it) has
so often done. This anthology could be
called a monument to Christesen and
“Meanjin Quarterly” during its first
25 years, but its prose and verse possess
much more life and variety than that
marmoreal word suggests. In this con-
nection, too, I need to say that, in a
sense, my small criticisms and implied
strictures may be beside the point, be-
cause although “On Native Grounds”
possesses a lot of general interest, it’s
at the same time a very personal
anthology: I mean, it reflects the per-
sonality and the wide interests of an
individual human being, the man
known to so many of his contributors
and friends over the years as simply
“Clem” or “Cris.” I was particularly
struck by this, reading the book as a
whole.
I once heard the late Dr. Evatt say
in a speech: “Chris is the magazine,
and the magazine is Chris”: I think
that’s true in a profounder sense, per-
haps, than Dr. Evatt meant. It means
that “On Native Grounds” makes a
different impression and should be
judged a little differently from, say,
the “Australian Poetry” or “Poetry in
Australia” anthologies and the two
volumes of “Short Stories of Australia.”
Long ago, Christesen complained in
a despairing moment about being a
middle-man for other men’s work, but
his particular achievement is subtly
and forcefully unique in our literature.
I have to admit that I can’t be
really objective about “Meanjin”: it’s
been (to throw away my monolithic
metaphor) too much a part of the
literary air I’ve breathed for too long.
To obtrude just two personal examples,
it was in “Meanjin,” years ago,
that I first discovered the superb
New Zealand poet James K. Baxter
(not in this anthology, because Chris-
tesen felt compelled “to eliminate all
non-Australian contributions”), in
“Meanjin” that I first read in full
poems by the almost legendary Bert-
ram Higgins (far too many years
ahead of his time here, during the
early 19305). Christesen in 1946 can
be said to have rediscovered this first
and most important of our “modern-
ists,” an excellent and unjustly
neglected poet: he reprints “The Isles-
and the Gulls” here, but Higgins, in
rewriting a few lines, has made it
slightly inferior to the originally pub-
lished version. Secondly, I can’t be
objective about Clem Christesen: I
owe him too much. It’s true that,
along with other and better writers,
I’ve had my differences with him.
Christesen, like “the editor” in Doug-
las Stewart’s good discursive poem in
the anthology, has received his share
“of quite unprintable curses,” had
poets and prose-writers call him
“A simple —” and “with decent deep
obscenity” (not that he lacks the
ability, if too much provoked, to reply
in kind); but if they’ve known him
at all personally, they end by regard-
ing him with a good deal of affection.
Also, a number of “M ean j i n
Quarterly’s” contributors, taking a
good, hard, second look at a rejected
piece of writing, have found that
“Meanjin” accepted a revised and bet-
ter version: in this regard, Christesen
is no respecter of names.
It’s true that “Meanjin Quarterly”
in recent years has gained a reputa-
tion for “squareness” among some of
the younger imaginative writers. I
think that, perhaps, the magazine has
veered a little toward literary conser-
vatism and can occasionally publish
some funnily old-fashioned poems and
labored, realistic fiction. This ten-
dency, however, is balanced by such in-
stances as Christesen’s having twice
published one of the most brilliant and
original of the younger poets, Andrew
Taylor, during 1967 (similar instances-


from previous years are preserved in
the anthology: e.g., Pound disciple Wil-
liam Fleming’s 1962 poem): Taylor
was also made one of “Meanjin’s”
Editorial Assistants.
“On Native . Grounds” reminds us
of just how many influential poems,
stories, and essays, pieces remarkable
in their own right, the magazine did
publish during its first 25 years. This
comes through clearly, even though Mr.
Christesen has felt it “proper” to give
“generous representation” to such
“main influences” as Vance Palmer
of little or no importance, as I believe,
to the direction of Australian letters at
the present point. A. A. Phillips, of
course, gave a phrase to the language
with “The Cultural Cringe.” But the
young literary men and women
particularly the poets certainly
aren’t reading the local models pro-
vided or recommended by their elders,
not even those offered or implied by
the leading contenders for what could
be called “The Literary Establishment’s
Younger Set.” Many, in fact, don’t
find much use for Australian literature
at all: they look to recent American
work, to modern French and Latin-
American imaginative writing. Some
of them listen to the records of Bob
Dylan. There’s a great gulf between
them and what one poet called “a
rapidly aging, once-young group of
discoverers.”
Christesen is quite right in his pre-
face, when he refuses to stress “an
element of contemporaneity” at the ex-
pense of everything else: possibly, he
will manage to provide some useful
reminders. I think that all these
factors are worth mentioning, since “On
Native Grounds” and “Meanjin
Quarterly” face, after all, a contem-
porary audience. Even those “re-
minders” could assist totally unforeseen
effects, helping to create literary forms
or anti-forms, a literary climate, con-
trary to all our ideas and conjectures
and desires.
The anthology successfully re-creates
something of the wide range which
“Meanjin Quarterly” already began to
show before it was half a dozen years
old. I regret Christesen’s omission of
the European, Asian, English, Ameri-
can, and New Zealand material which
has contributed not only to the maga-
zine’s individual flavor but also
and much more importantly to its
influential and commanding position.
However, the subtle but powerful in-
fluence of the cosmopolitan infusions
on a good deal of “Meanjin’s” in-
digenous content over the years can
be felt to some extent in this anthology.
I’ve indicated that the book is, in
certain respects, a literary history in
itself, though that isn’t so likely to
be a source of general attraction. “On
Native Grounds” should appeal to
almost all types of readers, simply be-
cause it reprints so many of “Mean-
jin Quarterly’s” best pieces of prose
and verse, and these are interesting and
rewarding in themselves.
Meta-bores
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
The Impact of the Russian Revolution,
1917-1967. The influence of Bol-
shevism on the world outside Russia.
With an introductory essay by
Arnold J. Toynbee. Issued under the
auspices of the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, Oxford Uni-
, versity Press, 1967.
SOVIETOLOGY HAS been in a state
of crisis for some time, and the
products of this young science are be-
coming increasingly boring and trivial.
This is due to a number of causes. One
is that there is an acute shortage of
brilliant defector-witnesses with a
sophisticated insight into the nature of
communist regimes. Penkovsky and
Mnacko just won’t do for Trotsky and
Suvarin. The communist enterprise
has become complex, sluggish, and
formless, thereby losing its highly
system-specific aroma. It is also becom-
ing increasingly difficult to maintain a
synoptic view which requires expertise
in the politics of places as divergent as
Laos and Albania. The subject,
pioneered 30 years ago by a small group
of brilliant, bitter, and dedicated revo-
lutionaries, has been sucked into the
Anglo-American academic establish-
ment with its deadening rituals, spurious
“research-techniques,” and prevailing
mediocrity. Since World War 11, Com-
munism has become, increasingly, an
Afro-Asian-Latin American affair
and let’s face it the Aidits and
Che Guevarras just don’t make the
grade intellectually, no matter how
efficient they may be as leaders of
peasant insurgencies: unlike the found-
ing fathers of Marxism they are intel-
lectually shoddy illiterates. And, finally,
by becoming “integrated” into various
more or less official or semi-official
agencies, Sovietologists have become a
part of the bureaucratic system of
make-belief: they must “produce” even
when there is nothing to go on and
write even where they have nothing to
say. They also seem to be expected to
whistle in the dark to cheer up their
blundering governments whose inept-
ness in dealing with totalitarian regimes
does not improve through the years
because it seems to be an intrinsic
property of pluralism in foreign and
defence policy.
The present volume is, however, ex-
ceptionally bad, and one should not
generalise from it, however distressing
the general state of Sovietology may be.
Toynbee’s introduction makes you
aghast at the man’s capacity to leave
no platitude unuttered until you realise
that he is the inventor of all these
spurious platitudes himself. Toynbee
is thus not only a bore he is a meta-
bore a fount of a race of bores. He
is also a bore with a capacity to annoy
by gross factual inaccuracies and exag-
gerations. The stupor of boredom is
punctuated by exasperation and mar-
ginal comments such as “not again”
and “how can you” are formed in one’s
mind until one realises that one is read-
ing not a Second Year essay heading for
a I 18, but the fatuous pronouncements
of a celebrity.
The deadening stupor of Toynbee,
or perhaps of the Royal Institute,
seemed to infect somehow the writing
of the very able men who contributed.
Seton-Watson’s chapter on nationalism
and imperialism is interesting, but he
has written much better on the same
topic elsewhere. Peter Wiles is whistling
in the dark' by explaining that the
Soviet economic model has had little
influence outside the U.S.S.R., since
nobody has followed Soviet methods in
detail. It is like saying that Nazi Ger-
many had no influence on Pavelich’s-
Croatia because the Croats didn’t build
autobahnen. Loewenthal’s chapter is.
long, detailed, and as so much of his
recent writing it makes you ask your-
self in the end: what did he say? Neil
Mclnnes’ chapter on Soviet influences
Arnold Toynbee... no platitude
unuttered
on the Labor movement is the best of
the book, though very narrow in scope
and conception.
Whoever it is that manages the Royal
Institute of International Affairs has-
succeeded in an improbable feat: he has
made the study of Bolshevism feel
trivial and useless.
Concerning the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, Danny Kaye’s
famous question, “What does the Royal
Institute of International Affairs do?”
seems apposite. Does it institute royally,
or merely institute international affairs?
One wonders. I personally prefer the
Beatles, though I am not quite sure
whether Toynbee functions as Epstein
or merely as the Maharishi.

Noble dramas
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Existence and Imagination: the theatre
of Henry de Montherlant. John
Batchelor. University of Queensland
Press. $6.95.
AUSTRALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS
to French literary studies have been
valuable and too little noted here:
Judith Robinson, of the University of
New South Wales, is the world
authority on Valery’s notebooks, and is
editing them for the Pleiades edition;
James Lawler, of the University of
Western Australia, has written as bril-
liantly on Valery, and Professor Chis-
holm’s work in the field is already
famous. To a small but energetic group
of scholars can now be added John
Batchelor, of the University of Queens-
land, who' has written a new and
absorbing analysis of the plays of
Montherlant, a figure not particularly
well known here and whose magisterial
talent, displayed in a dozen masterpieces
of fiction and theatre, should be
honored by regular stage performances
in our cities.
One’s chief regret where Mr. Batche-
lor’s book is concerned —apart from its
deplorable lack of an index—is that for
the uninitiated, and that must include
most of his Australian audience, there
is insufficient explanation and far too
much assumption of prior knowledge.
In addition the plays tend to be dis-
cussed without sufficient reference to
their theatrical realisation, and this may
be due to the possibility that Batchelor
has seen few of them actually per-
formed. Otherwise, everything here is
admirable and bears the rare stamp of
approval of Montherlant himself.
Batchelor divides his thesis into
studies of the plays of love, from
“L’Exil” to “Malatesta,” the plays of
action, from “L’Exil” again to “Borce-
liande,” and the plays of religion, from
the “Le Maitre de Santiago” to “La
Ville dont le Prince est un Enfant.”
In these plays, with their resplendent
language and aristocratic disregard of
the uninformed audience, Montherlant
has expressed his many selves.
His theatre is concerned with themes
not popular in our period of nihilism
and hedonism, of ideas squandered and
made cheap: these of duty, honor, and
loyalty, of romantic and spiritual love,
and of that nobility of character which
is continually disappointed by the
ignoble world. Together with these
elevated concerns, Montherlant shows
in his work for the stage that relentless
honesty which made his novel sequence
“Les Jeunes Filles” so triumphant a
masterpiece, bitterly ironic and intense.
In “Fils de Personne,” he deals with
George Carrion’s agonised relationship
with his illegitimate son, who dis-
appoints him at every level, and with
the boy’s monstrous mother, Maree San-
doval, in a manner scrupulously realis-
tic, cruelly exact. Yet the conclusion
is humanistic, as Batchelor suggests,
because in the end we are made to see
that, in a relationship of this kind, the
child’s interest must always be placed
first.
In “The Master of Santiago,” a bril-
liant play, we have an equally strenuous
parental relationship: set in Avila in
1519, this is the story of Don Alvaro,
whose daughter cannot marry her lover
unless Alvaro satisfies her future father-
in-law’s request for a dowry. Since it
involves going to the Indies for plunder,,
the acquisition of rifles would wreck
the structure of Don Alvaro’s idealism
and he refuses; the marriage contract
is called off. Batchelor profoundly dis-
cusses the problems of faith and duty
that the play poses, without wholly
capturing its action on the page.
Montherlant has always seized on
grand themes: in “Malatesta,” which
I once saw magnificently played at
the Theatre Marigny in Paris by the
Barrault company, the dynamism and
ruthlessness of those in search of power,
in “La Reine Morte” the struggle of
the spirit in the grip of good and evil,
in “L’Exil” the dangerous spirit of
mother love and the problem of war.
It is because Mr. Batchelor rightly
acknowledges these plays as rare
examples of philosophy applied to a
public medium that his book has its
great worth. Drama of this kind can
only make the efforts of Osborne, Pin-
ter, Wesker, and the other realist Eng-
lish playwrights of the period, by com-
parison, seem trivial and journalistic.
FAMILY MATTER
Last week they sent my wife’s grand-
father
In a cardboard box, to be embalmed.
We applied the fluid
In broad brush-sweeps to the alum-
white hide
Thinking all the time, and pretend-
ing not to,
Of the inheritance.
Then my wife
Noticed a stir, a rustling
Of leaf-brown-dry eyelid, a twitch
Of mushroom-skin cheek;
Till soon the grandparental corpse
was all smiles
And “How-are-you-my-dear” greet-
ings,
Not at all disconcerted
By his glistening obscene old naked-
ness.
We were appalled!
But thought quickly
And while Grandpapa’s head was out
Breathing around our rooms
And spitting in our stainless-steel sink
We (remembering the legacy openly
now )
Painted on the fluid
With a renewed zeal. The head came
back
Too late.
We learned yesterday

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
How to eat
your fruit and
drink it, too
THE FRENCH, long accustomed to
drinking their fruits as well as eating
them, have immortalised the practice
in folklore. A lady of Normandy, who
imbibed freely all her life, was care-
fully preserved by her husband in
calvados, and then celebrated by a
charming ditty:
Here lies my wife. Her dying wish:
“I think it would be dandy
To be preserved, when comes the end,
lake a ripe plum in brandy.”
The many combinations of fruit and
alcohol are well worth exploring. When
we lived in Spain I used to buy ripe
Malaga grapes and leave them to
dry in the sun turning the bunches
and removing the spoilt ones daily. '
When they had begun to crinkle
I picked them off the stems, put them
in a wide-mouthed jar, and filled it
up with brandy (it doesn’t have to be
very good brandy). Securely stoppered,
they sat for several weeks, slowly
swelling up again.
When next a particularly rich din-
ner had been devoured, the guests were
presented with glasses and toothpicks,
and into each glass the grapes and
liquid were ladled. The guests ate the
grapes with their toothpicks, and zest-
fully drank the brandy.
You can achieve the same result with
sultana grapes here, or even good
dried sultanas and the result will
be just as delectable. An equally good
combination is prunes and gin or
vodka, left to soak for at least a
month.
Liqueurs thus prepared are called
Ratafias in Europe, and at home I
remember them being made every
summer, for after-dinner drinking on
cold winters’ nights. They’re not at all
fashionable, even in Europe, these days,
I suppose because everyone has become
so accustomed to cans and bottles and
frozen foods that even a little labor
in the kitchen seems too much trouble.
Ratafias can be made with all kinds
of fruit, but dark cherries and plums
are probably the best. They must, how-
ever, be ripe and perfectly sound. The
fruit is simply washed and dried,
placed into large-mouthed glass jars,
and covered with brandy or gin. The
jars are then tightly sealed, and stood
on a windowsill where they will get
the sun, for 30 to 40 days, while the
fruit wallows in its alcoholic bath.
Then the jars are opened, and the
juice cajefully poured off the fruit
(which you can, of course, eat). To
each quart of juice you simply add
half a pint (or less according to taste)
of boiled sugar syrup. (This is simply
to sweeten your liquor; the boiling is
a quick way to dissolve the sugar.)
The resulting nectar is filtered (try
one of those “wet-strength” tissues that
the manufacturers are so proud of)
into bottles, and stoppered or corked,
to be served in small nips after dinner
under your own label if you are
determined to impress.
Even fresh fruit itself, unadulterated,
and glorified only with a dash or two
of Kirsch, is an incomparable sum-
mertime dessert. Kirsch itself is made
from the cherries of the Vosges in
France, by a long and costly process,
and seems to get into everything from
sauerkraut to fruit sherbets.
Personally I like it best on fresh
pineapple slices, or on a fruit salad
made only of chilled orange slices (cut
wafer-thin), pineapple chunks, and
dark cherries.
The emphasis is on fruit this week,
because this is time of year that I
most enjoy visiting my greengrocer,
fruitologist, or squashatorium.
One of the first things I ever learned to
cook at home was plum cake, and today
our household is still dotty about it. As
fast as I make them they disappear. The
best plums are Angelinas, dark purple
and easy to separate from the stones,
but other varieties are also good.
I am lucky enough to have a Ken-
wood mixer with the beater for making
pastry, so it is easy to prepare. If
your mixer can cope with fairly stiff
pastry, so much the better. Other-
wise you’ll have to roll up your
sleeves, flour your hands, and get on
with the kneading manually but
even so it doesn’t take long.
To make the pastry (which is really
the secret) you need six ounces of
butter and three tablespoons of sugar;
beat together until blended, and then
add one egg and beat a few more
seconds. Then while beating slowly
gradually add about 3 cups of self-
raising flour and a dash of salt. Gather
the resulting dough into a ball and
chill for a while. Wrapped in glad-
wrap it can be stored in the refriger-
ator for days, and used as required.
Slit about two pounds of plums
down one seam and remove the stone,
leaving the two halves attached down
one side, like Siamese twins.
Butter a biscuit tray (with slightly
raised edges), flour lightly, and cover
it with a layer of pastry about J inch
thick. Dust lightly with flour, and
cover with plums, the skin side down.
Spread generously with sugar and cin-
namon and bake at 375 degrees for
about 30 minutes. The pastry should
then be cooked through, lightly
browned, but still soft and crumbly.
Serve hot or cold, dusted again with
castor sugar, and with lashings of
whipped cream.

Fatal statistic
In “Fatal Statistic” (8., Feb. 3), the
analysis of the collision is perplexing.
You say “Jim Watts naturally swung
the car to the right and he did, too;
the collision took place virtually head
on.” You mean left, surely?
If drivers could be trained to natur-
ally swing the car to the left if an on-
coming car is about to hit them head
on, there would be no head-on colli-
sions. Instead of swinging left, drivers
facing a head-on seem to instinctively
slam the brake pedal, thus removing all
steering control, and slide straight into-
each ether. The Watts story is tragic,
but let’s learn something from it. If you
mistime your overtaking move, and a
head-on collision is two seconds away,
even if you’re passing a semi-trailer or
a car full of kids, swing left and no
one gets killed.
Simon Leigh
Killara, N.S.W.
In “Fatal Statistic” the point appeared
to be that an unnecessary accident
occurred because of the impatience or
ineptitude of the “other driver.” How-
ever, the article goes on to describe how
Jim Watts “naturally” turned right
into the path of three oncoming
vehicles. It would be interesting if some-
one could explain what the driver
of the Landrover and the non-involved
Holden “naturally” did to avoid be-
coming involved.

Aborigines, problems
Your article on Aborigines (8., Dec.
30) has some truth, but many of the
problems in most States are Govern-
ment-made.
In the Northern Territory, which has
over half the total full-blood Aborigine
population of Australia (and did not
have a vote in the recent referendum
because we are Territorians), we do not
look upon part-colored people as
Aborigines. Certainly some part-
coloreds have preferred to accept the
Aboriginal way of life, but, in most
cases, these people are part of and
accepted as citizens of our towns.
Indeed, many hold responsible positions
and a number operate their own busi-
nesses.
If the N.S.W. Government adopted
this attitude, its problems, with only
127 full-bloods, would be few, and Vic-
toria’s even fewer. But what Govern-
ment Department or Minister wishes to
work himself out of a job?

lems, but money alone will not cure
these. As your article suggests, con-
sultation with the Aboriginal people is
essential but practically non-existent.
Education is now available to nearly
every Aboriginal child in the Territory,
but education, without employment-
opportunity, will, in the words of full-
blood Aboriginal Philip Roberts, “only
confuse my people further.”
The need for responsibility and
authority to be handed back to the
Aboriginal people is probably one of
the most important unmentioned phases
in raising the Aborigine to our own
standards. Until this, it is a complete
waste of time talking of assimilation or
integration.
Possibly one of the most significant
things to happen this year in regard to
Aboriginal problems was the seminar
held at the Townsville University.
If Dr. Coombs does not make any
significant headway, possibly the
academics at Townsville and other
universities may be able to.

Why not Fijian nurses?
Recently I read of Australia’s acute
shortage of nurses and wondered why
does not someone open the doors wider
to girls from Fiji (or the South Pacific)
to train in Australia as nurses. Here
we have an excess of youth, many of
whom would make excellent nurses if
given the chance. This would be a
very practical way of - helping Aus-
tralia over her shortage and of helping
these girls find employment. The ones
who are given the chance make very
kind nurses.

Frightening N.Z. farmers
Your January article under “The Land”
is a good one, but does rather expect
too much from the agricultural scientist.
These people are, in the vast majority
of cases, men with limited practical
background and experience. As practical
farmers they, in my experience, tend to
not practice what they preach or make
an unholy hash. Their training and
experience is all against commercial
practice. .
Australia is a country with tremen-
dous farming potential, but the farming
needs a shot in the arm of something
and in considerable amount. Look at
the farmlands and the general set-up
along the road, any road, and what do
you see? The buildings are, in the main,
quite shocking and would not be toler-
ated in good urban areas. Fencing and
equipment generally is makeshift. Could
any other large commercial enterprise
continue to thrive with this sort of set-
up? Of course it couldn’t.
Until Australian farming gets a pride
of ownership and appearance, until it
becomes pretty lucrative on a long-term
basis, not only to farm but to “live
graciously” as a farmer, the potential
for production will remain untapped.
Australia farmwise requires men with
a practical approach. Men with good
commercial experience and sufficient
knowledge and expertise to be critical
of the scientist and, above all, financial
backing to ensure that farming is a
lucrative business for the middle-sized
chap who can get by with occasional
contract labor to help at particular
seasonal jobs.
Visiting Australia gives N.Z. farmers
the feeling that there is a land of oppor-
tunity, and with the state of the world’s
markets at present for primary produce
this potential is rather frightening from
New Zealand’s point of view.

"I was a chalkie... "
There is just one question I’d like to
ask your correspondent Richard Rice:
why did he stay so long working as a
lay teacher in the Catholic college?
If he really was received in the way
he described so very comically, surely
he could have stopped it there and then.
To be sure, there are loads of diffi-
culties in both State and Catholic
schools, but I feel sure Mr. Rice could,
perhaps, take up humorous writing
instead of reporting a system which can
only confuse readers of The Bulletin.

Barbara Mackenzie in her letter (8.,

credit to Miss Collier. But really, Mrs.

It is not often that one finds mistakes
in The Bulletin on the contrary,
your coverage of Australian news leaves

A progressively more sophisticated attitude to
education is making the dull, dark and foreboding schoolhouse a thing of the past. Many
of the new designs for schools make extensive use of safety-glass doors, windows,
translucent walls, and even glass roofing. These modern applications of glass are also
being employed by architects in their designs for factories, office buildings and private
homes.
