Election Notice*.
To the Federal Electors of Victoria.
Gentlemen, —
I beg to announce myself as a CANDIDATE
for one of the 10 seats assigned to Victoria in the
forthcoming CONVENTION, to be held to draft
a Constitution for the federation of the Australian
colonies. I shall be prepared to support a scheme
of federation on the following lines :
Under the Crown. —The union of the Aus-
tralian colonies indissolubly under the Crown.
Executive Government. The executive
government of the federation to be vested in a
Governor-General, appointed by the Queen, and
exercised by and through an administration re-
sponsible to the people represented in the Eederal
Parliament.
The Federal Parliament.—-To consist of two
Chambers—a Senate and a House of Representa-
tives—the Senate, or Upper House, being the
chamber in which the states will be equally repre-
sented ; the House of Representatives being the
popular chamber, or the National House, in which
the people of the federation will be represented by
members directly elected by them, each State re-
turning members in proportion to its population.
Limits of Federal Powers.— The Federal
Parliament and Government to be invested with a
power to deal -with foreign affairs, and certain
other specific and defined subjects of common
interest and general concern.
Autonomy of States. —The States to retain all
the powers, functions, and authorities now exer-
cised by them, except those which have been ex-
pressly transferred to the Federal Parliament and
Government.
Inter-Australian Free Trade.— Trade and
commercial intercourse between the States to be
absolutely free and unfettered upon the adoption
of a federal tariff by the Federal Parliament.
Foreign Trade. —The Federal Parliament to
have the exclusive power to impose duties of Cus-
toms upon the importation of goods from outside
countries, this being a power which, in my
opinion, would be exercised in the direction of
affording protection to Australian industries.
Railways. —The Federal Parliament to have
limited and defined control over railways for
federal purposes, especially to prevent the war be-
tween differential railway tariffs imposed by neigh-
boring provinces in order to attract trade from
one another.
Financial. —ln consideration of the transfer of
such revenue-earning departments as the Customs
and Excise and the Post and Telegraph, the federa-
tion to take over and be responsible for the public
debts and obligations of each State up to a stipu-
lated sum, the interest on which would be equal
to the revenue transferred.
Consolidation op Public Debts.—The federa-
tion to take steps to obtain a reduction in the rate
of interest on the consolidated public debts by a
scheme of conversion, under which it is estimated
that an annual saving in interest would be effected
amounting to .81,535,595. Of that sum the colony
of Victoria would gain ,8444,181. (See my article
on the “ Bathurst Federal Convention,” published
in the -Review op Reviews, 20th December, 1896.)
The additional federal expenditure, consequent on
the creation of a new Parliament and new execu-
tive and judicial departments, would not, it is
estimated, exceed the sum of .8230,000 per year.
Of that sum the Victorian proportion, according
to population, would be about £76,758. So that
the taxpayers would not have to bear any in-
creased burdens by federation, but, on the con-
trary, there would be large savings in the annual
interest bill more than sufficient to provide for
three times the above estimated increased expen-
diture.
Generally, I shall be prepared to promote
federation on democratic lines, coupled with
federal economy and provincial retrenchment.
Plan of Campaign.— Owing to the largeness of
the constituency to which I now appeal, as well as
the limited time and means at my disposal, I shall
be unable to engage in a personal canvas, but I
shall endeavor to address public meetings in
several of the large centres, when I hope to have
the opportunity of more fully expounding my
views.
I am, Gentlemen,
Yours obediently,
JOHN QUICK, LL.D.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emi-
nence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed in an
acute or chronic case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every ease he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best friend
and benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair both
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or the proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently accompanied by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of middle-aged
men, as well of young men, his success has been almost
invariable. ,
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female complaints,
liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder, kidney and heart
disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele and kidney troubles.

study of
SPECIAL DISEASES.

namely : —Frequent headaches, giddiness, drowsi-
ness in the daytime, irregularity of the bowels,
feeling of fullness after eating, specks before the
eyes, halos or circles round a candle, cold hands
and feet, pains in the back or under the shoulder-
blade, tenderness of the breast-bone on pressure,
palpitation of the heart, clammy hands, an
aversion to society, a fear of something dreadful
about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,

so prevent life-long misery.

All Sorts Suited
Perhaps you are one who only thinks of the
UTILITIES, one who eschews everything but
what is strictly necessary. You’ve a penchant
for FLANNELS, but have a DERRY on SILKS,
and when there’s HOMESPUN about you can’t
see the occasion for bothering about PLUSH and
VELVET. Simple and good is your motto ;
you’re almost a Quaker, though not quite, and
you’d rather see your money in the bank than on
your back, and dividends are better, say you, than
Ribbons and Laces. Well, have your own way.
We provide for all sorts and sizes.
Or perhaps you are of another class. A world-
ling, if you will, floating down the stream of life,
with “ youth at the prow and pleasure at the
helm,” you want to dress well and to look well.
The eyes of the fair are upon you, and you would
win their smiles. You want Clothes and Hats
and Boots, Gloves you must have, and a thousand
other things you crave for. Rings, Lockets,
Gems, exquisite Neckties, Shirts galore, good
CIGARS, and TOBACCO of the best. You’d
like them all, wouldn’t you ? You can have them,
sir, at our store for what is, when compared to
what other stores are asking, a mere song.

Tynan, the much-advertised “No. 1” of
the Fenian Brotherhood, whose recent burlesque
arrest was cabled all over the world, is thus de-
scribed by New York World
Tynan, nearly blind, a feeble, broken-down man, never
much more than a prematurely-aged baby, has been for
fourteen years the bugaboo by which English mothers
have scared their crying children to sleep. Of all the
men who might be chosen by conspirators froni this
country to commit the crime of bomb-throwing, Tynan
would be absolutely the last. In the first place, his claim
to notoriety rests entirely on his own loudly-proclaimed
assertions that he is the “No. 1” who.figured in the
Phoenix Park murders. Nine-tenths of the Irishmen in
America know that his claim to that doubtful distinction
is absurd, and that he was never more than a messenger
between John Walsh— “ Stockport, the real No 1
and the “ Invincibles,” who slew Lord Cavendish and
Under-Secretary Burke. When Tynan arrived in this
country in 1884 he found that the personality of No. 1
was still a mystery, so far as the general public was con-
cerned, and he being a man of somewhat quick resource,
immediately assumed the role, and Americans and Irish-
men who were not on the ground-floor accepted him.
Tynan got along for a time. He never prospered in any
sense because his spare moments were largely devoted to
posing He was a tremendous poser. He occupied the
centre of the stage, and the limelight played on him
whenever four or five Irishmen met to talk at a bar.
WHEN THE SEPARATOR SINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the early summer morning,
When the air is sweet and still,
Oh, I watch for Elsie coming,
After milking, down the hill,
Lifting lilting tunes so merry,
And love lightens up the land,
When she’s singing through the tussocks
With a pail in either hand.
When she goes into the dairy,
Love goes too, on lissom wings,
For he knows of kisses coming
When the separator sings.
When the separator sings
With its burr-urr-urr,
When the separator sings
With its whirr-irr-irr —
If love’s laughter you’d be learning,
And would feel love’s kisses burning,
Then just try the handle-turning
When the separator sings !
In the early winter dawning,
When the dew is on the grass,
Oh, I watch, as Elsie’s coming,
Grass-blades lean to let her pass ;
And her gold hair gilds the morning,
And her skirts uplifted be,
Just a bit above her ankle
And a bit below her knee.
As we cuddle in the dairy,
Greater we than queens or kings—
Love-land’s emperor and empress,
When the separator sings.
When the separator sings
With its burr-urr-urr,
When the separator sings
With its whirr-irr-irr,
Oh, the lore of love we’re learning,
And love’s guerdon we are earning,
While the handle’s turning, turning
When the separator sings 1
Winter, summer, every morning,
Neither drought nor dew can daunt;
From the dairy every dawning
Elsie’s heart and mine will jaunt
To the years of joyous wedlock
In the happy days to be,
When I shall have married Elsie,
And she will have married me.
In the future by our fireside,
When we’ve heard our bridal clang,
Won’t we bless the merry mornings
When the separator sang ?
When the separator sang
With its burr-urr-urr,
When the separator sang
With its whirr-irr-irr,
When love’s laughter we were learning,
And we felt love’s kisses burning,
As the handle I was turning
When the separator sang l
STEELE GREY.
A MOTHER.
A withered wee old woman comes in dreams
From forth the mirage-desert-land of Death,
And in her haggard eyes for ever beams
The that is fanned by God s own
breath ;
And when the track ahead is tramped by men
Who scorn Dishonor as a loathsome load
One hand clasps mine. A hopeful kiss-—and then
The other points me up the mountain-road !
And when at times, where mountain pathways
meet,
Adown a shady bridal-track I gaze
To where some fair Sin with suggestion sweet
Half-hides and beckons through the forest haze,
She comes between, her hands tight-clasped in
fear,
Her old face puckered into pained seams,
Her eyelids throbbing with the unshed tear,
Sweet, withered, wee old woman of my dreams !

Tobacco Manufacturers.
The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a J?l?iC0 TJII"
kHOWH HGFG a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes fiom Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Vuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6cl.!!— win at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note-Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any
address on receipt of 10s. while this advertisement appears.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1897.
Signs of Prosperity.
The year which has just commenced promises
to be one of magnificent borrowing. Six out
of the seven provinces have loans in view,
most of them large ones, and the signs are
that 1897 is to be the wildest loan-boom year
that Australasia has seen since the early ’Bo’s.
Westralia proposes to raise £7,000,000, and
have such an orgy on the proceeds as no
other community of its size ever had since
the fall of Babylon, or some such remote
date. New South Wales is a good second
with a scheme for raising nearly £5,000,000
in all. Queensland is planning a loan of
over 2 : j- millions ; Maoriland is borrowing
£1,000,000 ; Victoria and Tasmania £250,000
each ; and only South Australia stands out—
though it may also rush to the front later on.
The total, so far, is £15,700,000, which is a
rather considerable outbreak for a population
of a little over 4,000,000 souls, and is sug-
gestive of the worst days of the loan-drunk
which raged during the last decade. It was
a great and glorious drunk while it lasted,
when New South Wales borrowed and
“ blewed ” millions inside three years,
and Queensland got through nine millions in
four years, and Victoria dissipated 11| mil-
lions in the same period. Those good days
came to a sudden stoppage about ’9l, when
the British lender had a cold fit of funk,
hence depression settled down on Australia,
and it sat in sackcloth and scraped itself
sadly, like Job, with a potsherd. There was
much talk of economy about that time, and
of swearing-off and being a good, self-respect-
ing community ; but now that the British
capitalist has again money to lend, the riot
recommences as gaily as ever, and six hogs
in a row have returned to their wallow.
* * * *
Australian booms, since the first great
gold deposits gave out, have all been built
more or less on borrowed money. The great
rivalry between New South Wales and Vic-
toria is a case in point. Going by the census
periods, the latter province was far ahead in
every respect up till 1881, and kept pretty
well abreast till 1891. With only one-
quarter the area it had, till 1881, 100,000
more people, as large a revenue, more immi-
grants, as much commerce and shipping,
more railways, agriculture, manufactures, a
bigger capital city, and more boom of every
kind. Also it had a debt of 22 millions
against the older province’s 17 millions.
Then, from 1881 to 1896, the mother pro-
vince, as its orators are so fond of pointing
out, overtook its competitor with ‘ ‘ giant
strides.” It got ahead in population, in
shipping, in revenue, and it got vastly ahead
in immigration. In these 15 years ending
in 1896, New South Wales borrowed
£45,000,000 against Victoria’s £25,000,000,
and the province with the biggest inrush of
loan-money had the biggest boom as usual.
From 1892 to 1895 Victoria only added
about £200,000 to its debt. This was the
first time it had practically sworn off in 20
years, and, as the natural result, the loan-
dipsomaniac province went through an awful
process of recovery, which is only now show-
ing signs of being over. If Victoria keeps
off its ancient dissipation the recovery will
not have to be repeated ; if it gives way
again to the old drunkenness its next attempt
to swear off will be marked by the same pain-
ful monetary swelled head in the morning,
and the agony will have to be gone through
all over again. In the four years New South
Wales borrowed £7,000,000, therefore,
though it was depressed, having been accus-
tomed to borrow twice or three times that
amount, it wasn’t nearly so depressed as the
province which had sworn off altogether.
Under these conditions, it viewed its neigh-
bor with scorn, and claimed, and still claims,
much superior merit. New South Wales
has its recovery still to do, and, having been
on the borrow every year for 23 years, it
doesn’t yet know what the painful process is
like.
* * * *
The only years —there were about four of
them, all told—when the New South Wales
railways paid their way were years of tremen-
dous borrowing ; when the borrowing dimin-
ished the boom faded, and the railways
promptly became a losing investment, and
have remained that way ever since. The
Victorian railways had a brief spell of profit
in the early ’Bo’s, when the province made
its last big effort at the part of the prodigal
son and borrowed £9,000,000 in four consecu-
tive years ; but they have never got there, or
even anywhere near there, since. South
Australia made a substantial profit on its
lines for several years—the ones when it was
borrowing over a million per annum ; now it
is borrowing on a very small scale, and its
lines are in the general category of deficits.
The only paying railway system in the seven
provinces is now that of Westralia, which is
also the most frantic borrower of the seven.
Likewise, Westralia is the only province
with a boom. This year it is anticipated
that Westralia will raise a little over one
million of gold out of its mines and about
six millions out of John Bull, and
the result will be described, in the usual
phrase, as the Westralian gold-boom, and
hardly anybody will notice that only one-
seventh is gold and six-sevenths are paper
and I O U and burdens handed down to
posterity. Westralia, by the way, is the
only province whose circumstances make it
possible to raise a decent borrowing boom of
the old dazzling kind, and when it bursts
there will be nothing big remaining, until
New Guinea and the Northern Territory
have grown large enough to go on the tear
upon their separate account. Away back in
’B4 New South Wales was accustomed to
raise 5| millions in a year, and only a little
over one-fifth of it went out in interest,
leaving more than four millions to create a
great burst of prosperity in the country.
Now the borrowings are about two millions
a year, and it all goes out in interest on the
enlarged debt, and nothing remains to create
what is commonly called prosperity. There-
fore there is very little prosperity, and there
is going to be less. Only a general borrow-
ing of 6f millions per annum from now till
the end of the century could make New
South Wales what it was a decade ago.
Westralia, not having accumulated a very big
interest bill as yet, is just now where its
neighbors were about 16 years ago. A few
years lienee it will probably be where they
are now, which is a very different situation.
* * * *
The great I O U business is deteriorating
in character as well as in size. The primary
object of borrowing for many years back has
been to furnish employment. The first
great outbreak of railway construction
created a boom in the labor-market, and
brought a large increase of population.
When the works were finished there was no
employment for the discharged laborers, so
more works were started to keep them em-
ployed. When all the railways which pro-
mised to be immediately profitable were
finished, unprofitable ones were started.
So long as the unemployed could be
absorbed and poverty jkept down and depres-
sion put out of sight by railway building
there was some semblance of sanity about
the proceeding. It was not openly and
avowedly a case of relief works, but of
“opening up the country ” and “developing
the national resources,” and things like that”
Now the railway-building cannot be con-
ducted on the old scale of magnificence
because it is already ahead of population in
many places; if the unemployed question
was solved and the depression lifted in the
old heroic way it would necessitate construct-
ing hundreds of miles of line that wouldn’t
pay working expenses. The interest on bor-
rowed money would be one loss, and the
deficit on working another, so the cash would
be thrown away twice over. Therefore,
Premier Reid now borrows for statues and
repairs, and for sand-shifting and forest-
thinning and road-making and scrub-cutting
purposes ; and Premier Seddon borrows for
roads to open up the scenery of Maori-
land so that the debilitated tourist can
view the beauty spots of the province;
and Premier Turner borrows for the pur-
pose of cutting tracks in Gippsland. The
business is getting down to be, in the
main, pauper relief with no disguise what-
ever. There is no legal enactment in any of
the provinces setting forth what may justly
be charged to loans, and what should be
debited to revenue, so this matter depends
wholly on the unscrupulousness or incom-
petence or mendacity of the Government and
its majority. There is no limit to the
amount which may be borrowed in any one
year. There is no law requiring that the
additional debt incurred shall bear any rela-
tion to the increase of population, so as to
prevent the burden on each inhabitant grow-
ing larger; and even in these days of com-
parative moderation the liability on each
Australian grows larger every year. It was
£34 per head in 1881, and in 1895, despite
15 years of the most rapid population-in-
crease in the country’s history, it reached
£52 per head. Altogether there are many
possibilities in front of this great country.
Three years more at the present gorgeous
rate should see the last survivor of the
booms—that of Westralia—about through,
Then Australasia should be in a position to
sit down among the ruins, and look back on
its first complete century—the fastest first
century in any new country’s record—and
think deeply about all the joys and sorrows,
the booms and bursts and glories and panics
—that it has compressed into that brief
period, and wonder thereat.
That Federal Capital.
“ Fluffy ” to The Bulletin :
As a Victorian of the most bigoted and persecuting
type, I want to mention that there are only two proposals
for a Federal capital that are worth mentioning. The
Bulletin’s special fancy for a location half-way between
the Wallaby Track and the Never Never Land I look down
upon with the generous pity of a right-thinking person.
As I said, there are only two schemes —Sydney Jephcott’s
and Mine. But The Bulletin’s idea is not bad as a flight
of fancy—supposing we eliminate all the practical diffi-
culties and unpleasantnesses. So far back as 25th Aug.,
’94, J. G. Drake (Q.) unbosomed himself of a Marble City
mid-way between Bourke and Charleville, built on a
block of 50,000 sq. miles taken around the spot where
three provinces (Q., N.S.W., and S.A.) meet. J. G. D.
assures us that the climate is all that can be desired,
Bourke having a mean summer temperature J^deg. less
than Cairo and 4deg. less than New Orleans. (How much
copier than Hay, Hell, and Booligal is not stated.) The
idea is that railways will be built to this cool corner, so
that perspiring Australians might take a journey thither
as a pick-me-up. The most surprising thing about
this scheme is that it was afterwards adopted
by The Bulletin. The “ further edge of nowhere,
on the road to the setting sun,” the “sultry
regions of Western Queensland among the head waters of
the Gregory River,” were gravely set forth as offering a
chance for a Federal capital that would appease jealousies,
give the railways an object in life, offer an opportunity
for an experiment in land nationalisation, scatter the
population a little more, and place the machinery of
Government, Treasury, and the State arsenals out of
reach of the inevitable invader. Pom, pom ! It is the
present writer's belief that this invader person will dodge
Australia for fear of getting mixed up in the Fiscal Issue
—but supposing that he will come, he won’t want Trea-
sury ledgers, State documents, and the visitors’-book
from Government House. He will want Cash, and will
find it in the bank-vaults of Sydney and Melbourne.
Moreover, if Central Mount Stuart is to be made the State
arsenal, then the State forts may as well be shifted there
also. Lately The Bulletin has been mentioning Port
Augusta as the ideal spot for the capital. The writer does
not pretend to know where Port Augusta is, but it is so
obviously a resort of sand-flies, mixed Asiatics, and
suicide as to be out of the question.
* • * »
The Sydney Conference postponed the Capital question
—“ left it open ”—as something too definite and danger-
ous for the generalities of Federal agreement. There has
been one self-denying ordinance. Bathurst has offered to
withdraw its claims. But there are plenty of claimants.
Albury has agreed enthusiastically that the capital should
be near Wodonga, on the N.S.W. side of the river
'w 0 ? 1 (Yia)> Launceston (Tas.), and Newcastle
(N.S.W.) feel .sure, that if merit had any chance there is
only one place in it. Ballarat has decided that its central
position on the railway from Geelong (near Vic.) to
Adelaide is a distinct from Heaven. Adelaide waits
in holy meekness, confident of the result. Geelong
agrees that the question would be settled by dredging
Conoßay. Meanwhile, Sydney and Melbourne frankly
watch one another, waiting for the coming struggle that
will settle political, if not commercial, supremacy.
• * * *
_ SVIJN’EY Jefhcott’s scheme is to have no Federal capital
a , fc ,■ seat of Federal Government in Australasia
should not be fixed, but movable.” Jephcott proposes
that each provincial capital in the Federation should be
recognised in turn. Legislators would assemble one
year in Sydney, next in Melbourne, next in Adelaide.
[Presumably the Government offices would be dragged
round on wheels per bullock.-ED. B.] If the MaSri-
lander and the Westralian were included in such a
scheme, neither could be chilled by the idea that his pro-
? , bec . o ™® a f c 'P he . r the sum of Australasian
nationality. At first hearing the plan sounds bizarre.
Australians are so chained to old-world conventions that
they wear bell-toppers in their broiling summer, build
houses on the ideas evolved in the congested cities of
semi-Arctic countries, and import most of their literary
and all of their dramatic opinions from London. England
has a fixed capital. Therefore, Australia must have a
fixed capital. England eats hot plum-pudding at Christ-
mas therefore Australia, &c. In the Jephcott proposal
the Federal legislator would not be subject to one city’s
influence from year to year. If he held office for as many
years as there were capitals in the Federation, he would
become as familiar with the life and spirit of the other
capitals as with his own. I have talked this scheme over
. ?w’ u'! d he , ? ees nothing much against it except
this . that Jim would never agree to it. This, I am afraid
is fatal. Bill is not content to vote for a thing he wants
himself-he must be convinced that Jim wants it also
Likewise, Jim refuses to support any notion that doesn’t
strike him as being acceptable to Bill.
• * * * '
What are the essentials of a Federal capital, supposing
we must have one ? For one thing, it must be a
place to live in, so that legislators shall not pose before
the country as martyrs in the cause. If we hive it in f
thinly-populated locality, there is a danger that the politi-
cal ideas of members may become subordinated to Social
necessities. What Murray Smith calls the “club feeling
which always exists in such bodies ” as legislatures,
dangerously by banishing the leg slators
‘° a Picturesque isolation , n some geometrically-corre”
centie of Australasia. The danger would manifest itself
in emasculating debates of those severe and searching-
criticisms that make our rulers tread warily, would result
in toleration of abuses rather than the ruptnre nf tv!!
friendships that made the place of exile tolerable In a
nw‘ ty ’ 'u e ' nbers fin . d con Kenial circles outside" Parfia
ment each man remains more or less himself, and does
not become merely an approximation to a comfortable
average !n a big city there is mental activity—a nervous
sj stem that responds sympathetically to big ideas and
big movements in the cause of humanity a"J
these is the press of a big city—Sydney or Melbourne, e.g.
—which is alert, critical, many-voiced. The communica-
tor from Parliament to people—and from people to Parlia-
ment. Criticising, castigating, belauding parliamentary
doings for the benefit of the public.. Reflecting, creat-
ing, transmuting, dissecting public opinion for the benefit
of Parliament. The mathematical mean of the forces
represented by Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Wellington,
Adelaide Hobart, and Perth is as absurd as a logical con-
clusion if it be fixed 1000 miles away from every great
newspaper. If we must have a fixed capital, let it not be
a little village that, in session, would be a habitation for
bored legislators and bureaucrats, and, in recess, an
empty tomb haunted by a scared caretaker or two, in-
structed to frighten away the dingoes.
* * • •
Considered as big cities, most of the provincial capitals
are failures. Only two, Melbourne and Sydney, fill the
bill. [Adelaide may now consider itself abolished.]
After all, what a city Melbourne is! It has a smelly
river, and a sanitary system that makes the night a thing
that can be felt—like the darkness of Egypt. These are
on one side of the ledger ; on the other side must be put
the fact that it is a city of enjoyments. Its tramway and
railway systems are almost perfect, as far as the comfort
of the passengers is concerned. It has the finest race-
course in the world. Its best theatre is the best in Aus-
tralia. It is the musical centre of Australia. Its news-
papers are close to top-notch. It is a city of ideas, and
of men who think, and there is an intellectual contagion
in its air (as well as other contagions, did you say ?). If
you would judge the influence of Melbourne, look for it
in Sydney trade and commerce, and see what Melbourne
men have done and are doing there.
* • * *
Melbourne is indisputably the best place in Australia
for the capital—bar Sydney. In November Melbourne
has a great attraction for visitors, and its streets are
thronged with folk from all corners of the Australias—
and even the alleged Australian Navy finds time to give it
a cali. But Melbourne is not a city for sightseers. We
want a Federal capital that will be attractive to the legis-
lators —but it is also extremely desirable that a tide of
the electors should flow through it, to intensify the pub-
licity that is so essential to the good conduct of public
business. We want the Federal capital to be complete at
all points—and beauty of situation is a principal one.
That Yankee tornado, Talmage, described Sydney Harbor
as the magnificent gateway of Australia. The Harbor is
such a compendium of exquisite beauties that it touches
every beholder —the more shallow of whom attempt
to disguise their feeling by uttering bad jokes. I
don’t think that even The Bulletin has made
a good joke about the Harbor. That was funny
about the syndicate wanting to tunnel beneath
it to North Shore, so that people could go by ’bus to busi-
ness, instead of by ferry. But that wasn’t a joke on the
Harbour, it was a joke on the Sydney newspapers. As
regards situation, Sydney is incomparable. The approach
to Melbourne from the sea is the dreariest, dirtiest per-
formance. Port Phillip Bay has all the disadvantages of
the ocean, with none of its beauties. Hobson’s. Bay is a
partial relief—then comes the obscure river-passage, with
its ludicrous sign-boards, “ Dead-Slow,” to suggest the
facts of the case to the unobservant traveller. Or, you
land at Port Melbourne and go by rail along the back of
the back-yards of an ugly suburb. From Sydney Heads
to Sydney the steamer is an item in a transformation-
scene —one beauty melting into and outrivalled by the
next. Nature made up her mind about the Federal
Capital before even the kangaroo was evoluted. The site
has been prepared with such care that, apparently, man
cannot spoil it. Even Pinchgut, horrible anywhere else,
becomes picturesque in Sydney Harbour. And yet we
hear of men going about talking as if any other place
could be the capital!
PLAIN ENGLISH.
British Capital.
A week or two ago the Bendigo (Vic.) Amal-
gamated Miners’ Association carried a resolu-
tion that the Government should despatch an
official boomster to England “ with the object
of inducing British capitalists to invest in
Victorian mines.” The Age has also lifted its
voice on several occasions to the effect that
outside capital should be attracted to Vic-
torian mines, and the usually level-headed
Turner Government now cables sensational
mining returns to London—also with a view of
attracting British capital. The Bulletin
moves as an amendment upon this that Vic.
should pass a law prohibiting any Victorian
mine being owned by any person or syndicate
or co. outside of Australasia, and that British
capital arriving for investment should be
treated on the same principles as phylloxera or
tick. This country's state securities are now
mostly owned in England, likewise a lot of its
municipal securities, its banks, insurance com-
panies, its city lands, pastoral and agricul-
tural ditto, its bricks and mortar, mortgages,
shipping interests, shares in all manner of
companies—-in fact, the whole country is more
or less owned by or mortgaged to England.
The proposal that a deliberate effort should be
made to get the British claw on the only im-
portant industry that is yet mostly Australian
is a wondrous slab of foolishness. Victoria
can, no doubt, attract British capital if it sells
its mines at prices which will enable the J.
Bull man to make a profit, but a much simpler
and more beautiful idea is to keep them and
make the profit itself. The said profit is wanted
badly enough. A big inrush of British capital
might get the gold out faster, but when the
question lies between getting it out faster for
the benefit of J. Bull or getting it out more
slowly for the benefit of the Australian himself,
the latter idea seems to have something to
recommend it. Whether the country sells its
mines, or its pastoral or agricultural lands, or
its city properties, to J. Bull and has a tem-
porary boom with the money, or whether a
private citizen sells his house and has a great
outbreak of champagne and jewellery and
lottie with the proceeds till it is
gone, the result is much the same. Either
way it is the spendthrift policy of sell-
ing the regular income of the future
tor a day or two of garish boom and howl in the
present; it is the story of the prodigal son—
the Israelite that failed—over again without
variations. For the country which has no gold
worth speaking of the idea of attracting British
capital to its mining industry has much to re-
commend it regarded as plain swindle on a large
scale; for the country which has gold it is
ruinous. British capital attracted to the land-
jobbing and banking business landed Victoria
in tbe great boom and the heartrending smash
of a few years ago. British capital-if there is
enough of it—attracted to the mining industry
may easily do the same a few years hence ; and
the spectacle of the Victorian who is just re-
covering from one historic burst trying already
to lay the foundations of another is a dis-
mal evidence of the shortness of the public
memory. Also, the spectacle of a country,
which believes in Protection as a means of
developing local industries and making the
community self-reliant, craving after im-
ports of foreign capital and wanting to rely
on the foreign capitalist, is somewhat sorrowful.
It Victoria developes its own gold-industry as
it has done in the past, the profits of it, dis-
tubuleU locally, will see it through many


seasons of depression for years and years to
come. If it booms furiously on British capital
a number of people will make big fortunes
trading off properties to J. Bull, and many of
them will go to Europe with their pile to make
acquaintance with dukes and other animals ;
and thereafter the mining-dividends will go to
England to pay interest on the other money that
has gone to England also, and Victoria will lose
the interest without getting much of the prin-
cipal. Then the British manager will come out
and eject the local man from his billet, and
wages w ill be cut down to make dividends on
the huge nominal capital with which the British
Stock Exchange robber always burdens his
mining-enterprises, and in one way and another
the Bendigo Amalgamated Miners’ Association
will have cause to wish it had never been born.
The Case of Cecile Andersen.
There is a fatality which haunts the people
who decide to “die together”; in probably
three instances out of four the episode pans out
the same way—one is taken and the other left.
The latter is generally left for the hangman or
the gaol, the law mostly assuming that the
person who survived was the one mainly re-
sponsible. The Middle Park (Melb.) tragedy,
where the episode was left unfinished in the
usual fashion, has served to draw attention to
another Melb. case of a few years back —that
of Mrs. Andersen —which was more or less of
the same order. In regard to this matter a
Melb. correspondent writes :
Presuming that your readers have a general idea of the
circumstances which led up to the tragedy, I will state
the facts as they occurred on the 19th June, 1894. Fraser
and Mrs. Andersen sat on a large-sized sofa in a room by
themselves, Fraser at the right-hand end and Mrs.
Andersen at the other end. At 10 o’clock two shots,
fired in succession, were heard, and three persons who
had been only a few feet away hurst into the room. They
found Fraser and Mrs. Andersen still seated as described,
both apparently dead— Fraser with a bullet wound in
his left temple, and Mrs. Andersen shot behind her right
ear. The cape of Mrs. Andersen’s dress was thrown over
her head, and a revolver was lying on the floor in front of
Fraser, several feet from Mrs. Andersen. Fraser was
quite dead, but Mrs. Andersen, on being removed to the
hospital, recovered. It was proved that the bullet had
been fired at Fraser’s temple “ from above and behind.”
The medical evidence alleged that Mrs. Andersen’s wound
caused instantaneous insensibility ; nevertheless, to make
her guilty she must not only have fired that shot at
Fraser, but, after having next shot herself, she must
have placed the revolver several feet away, and then
thrown her cape above her head and awaited the denoue-
ment. All this looks like a physical impossibility. I am
indebted to the late Lormer Board here for a very apt
Eh rase, which enables me to criticise the trial without
eing guilty of contempt of court, viz., “unconscious
bias.”
The case turned entirely on the question
whether Mrs. Andersen shot Fraser or
whether Fraser shot her, or whether they
attempted two separate and individual suicides
by mutual agreement, and the evidence looks a
little worse in the first-named direction than in
either of the others. Anyhow, there was a very
large-sized doubt, and the prisoner did not get
the benefit of it. She was sent to gaol and
narrowly escaped being sent to the gallows on
a miserably weak case. Probably the thing
above all others which wrecked her chances was
the fact that she was a Woman with a Past,
and her Past, expounded at great length in the
daily papers, aroused the soul of the great
aggregate Podsnap against her. Fraser also
had a Past —the same one as Mrs. Andersen’s ;
they had apparently shared it together —-but
the kind of respectability which is symbolised
in a shiny top hat takes no notice of such things
except in a woman. Mrs. Andersen’s case is
only one of many which go to show the neces-
sitj' of a court of criminal appeal in Australia.
The system by which the litigant in a small
matter of property can carry his case from one
court to another and appeal again and again,
while the one whose life is at stake has only
one toss-up with the hangman, is an infamy.
The N.S.W. Timber “Trade.”
A WELL-INFORMED correspondent: —
Now is the time when you will read in the N.S.W.
coastal press glowing accounts of the revival of the timber-
trade in half-a-dozen districts. Details of the “ pros-
perity’’thus produced are never given. Let me record
them, taking a typical case. Victoria (say) calls for
tenders for some big national work. Specifications state
that the timber must be well-seasoned Australian hard-
wood or ironbark girders, so many inches in diameter,
square, or whatever the case may be. Blank & Co. are
Victorian or S.A. contractors, and submit a tender, which
in due course is accepted. They have made all necessary
inquiry, and know exactly where to go for the timber.
Of course, they come into N.S.W., where an asinine Govt,
will give them timber for the taking of it away. They
erect their mill on one of the rivers, on a site obtained
from Govt, for a few pounds a year rent. In a very short
time the bush around resounds with the echoes of the axe.
The local paper prints a column congratulating the district
on its good fortune in having a new industry started in its
midst, and points out that the shipping-trade will be con-
siderably increased. Soon Blank and Co. have a load
of timber ready for their schooner, which is daily ex-
pected from Victoria in ballast. What does the ballast
consist of? Flour, oats, potatoes, chaff, &c., from Victoria
or S.A. for the use of Blank and Co.’s men. Meanwhile,
the best of the waste and flitch pieces have been utilised.
Blank and Co. have had a couple of dead-beats erecting
buildings which are sold or rented to employes at the
mill. Blank and Co. build a store to hold the schooner’s
stock, and retail it at prices from 10 to 25 per cent, above
local values. The men soon learn the consequence of not
buying at the mill-store. In a very short time the bulk
of the employes are in debt to the mill-owners, and con-
tinue so till the end of the chapter. The majority of
mill hands get rid of the few shillings which may
fall into their hands very easily by dint of hard
drinking and gambling. Consequently, any out-
sider who may be unfortunate enough to have
money owing him from them has Buckley’s show of
getting it. If he sues the debtor, the debtor has nothing,
and if he garnishees the employers he finds that they are
also creditors. All this time the timber-cutting is going
on briskly. For a month or two the cutters hold licenses
and are able to produce them when the Govt, forester
happens along, but presently this way of working is found
inconvenient, and the mill-owners undertake to obtain
the necessary licenses and keep them at the office for the
men. The whole of the district, which may comprise
several millions of acres, is under the control and super-
vision of one forester, and, of course, he cannot be every-
where at once, and may possibly visit the locality where
Blank and Co. are working once in three or four months.
When he does, and finds the men working in the bush, he
is referred to the mill-owners for the production of the
licenses. The chances are ten to one that the mill-owners
have omitted to take licenses out for that month, though
they have not omitted to debit the cutters’ accounts with
the necessary fee. Of course the affair is fixed up between
Blank and Co. and the forester - the firm being cor
sidered above suspicion. The cutting is still going on,
and I will guarantee there is not a suitable tree within
the working radius which is left standing. Reserves
or private property —it is all the same. To-day the trees
are standing : to-morrow they are gone, and no one
knows who felled them. An application to. the mill-owners
brings no satisfaction. They do not know who cut the
trees or who drew them in. If by any chance they are
caught in the act, ignorance is the plea ; and if the poor
cockv who owns the land is anyway easy they soon ob-
tain his consent to let the log go to the mill by promising
payment, but he does not find out what that means until
he goes to collect it. For all this timber which goes away
the country at large receives no benefit whatever. Per-
haps the girders and piles for export are being hauled a
long way to deep water. The haulers make their wages,
but the local farmers sell them nothing, for the fodder
used is all imported from wherever the timber is going—
either Maoriland or Victoria. The residents of N.S.W.
northern districts have for years been agitating for a line
of railway along the coast, and perhaps in a few years the
line will be sanctioned ; but if the. export of timber con-
tinues, where will the necessary timber for viaducts, &c.,
come from ? Don’t think the large timber reserves will
provide it. I am well acquainted with several of these,
and can say there is very little good timber left there to-
day. There is a little retail planting, but the denudation
is wholesale. For obvious reasons N.S.W. should husband
its timber ; and if it*is to be given away in one sense, why
not appoint the police as assistant-foresters and there
would be more chance of the license-fees being paid ?
Fixing the Capital.
That fatally-fluent politician, Minister Car-
rut hers, of N.S.W., announces that he is in
favor of “fixing the capital at Sydney or in
some portion of New South Wales to be created
a federal territory.” It would be interesting
to know if Minister C. has any distinct idea of
the consequences of his proposition. On one
point there is practically no doubt; the Federal
capital must be Federal territory. The Com-
monwealth Government can’t be merely a lodger
on sufferance in the house of one of the sub-
ordinate States, liable to be ordered off the
grass by the provincial legislature, or to be
ejected bodily if the local authority and it
come to loggerheads, and dependent on the
local Parliament for a place where it can sit
down to get its second wind. It must have a
location of its own—a place where it can plant
itself and its Government offices and its Federal
courts and its arsenals and other pomps
and necessaries without asking permission
of anybody ; in short, its capital must be its
own territory—not merely a place where a
provincial legislature kindly takes it in out of
the wet and allows it to remain as a sort of
adopted orphan. But this is just the reason
why the Commonwealth should select a site
and grow its own capital. If Mr. Carruthers’
plan of making Sydney the capital and creating
it a Federal district is carried out the result
will be that N.S.W. will lose its one great city
altogether. And without it the “ mother
province ” will be a place of comparatively
small importance with a population of about
800,000. It will be the second instead
of the first province of the Federation, Victoria
being far ahead of it. If Maoriland joins in, as
it probably will do before long so as to get on
the right side of the Federal tariff barrier,
then there is every chance that N.S.W. will
presently be only the third State of the
Commonwealth. It will lose, roughly speak-
ing, about one-third of its revenue, possibly
more. If Melbourne became the capital, and
was created a Federal district in like manner,
Victoria would be reduced in one act to a level
very little higher than that of South Australia.
The moral is that the province which tries to
make its one big city the Federal Capital, with
the almost certain result that it will lose its
big city, in a provincial sense, altogether, has
found a first-class way of committing suicide,
and the people who are grabbing so hard after
an empty distinction should think seriously over
this.
Bush. Morality.
Ed. Bulletin, —The conviction of the Dederer
lads, followed by the Cassilis mystery, has
raised a chorus in the press on the enormities
of bush degradation, and foreign missionaries
are bidden with a loud voice to stay at home
and mind the shop. On such data, the con-
clusion and inference are alike illogical and un-
justified. That there are low mental types in
the bush is true enough ; but no one has shown
that they exceed in number those of the towns.
Grapes are not gathered off thorns, nor can
you dump down into a colony, for a generation,
ship-loads of criminals and expect the progeny
to be wholly unlike their progenitors. Any
breeder of live-stock knows more than that.
And the inference, “ that religious instruction
would alter the conformation of human
craniums,” is as rational as the hope of making
racehorses by reading Bible lessons to a mob of
brumbies. Religion and morality have no more
connection than, say, religion and teetotalism.
Devotion naturally arose from man’s first won-
der at the mysteries that surrounded him ; his
morals come from social necessity, and are
being evolved and modified every day from the
same cause. Some of the most bloodthirsty
Italian brigands have been pious, giving large
contributions to the church ; instances are
common in our own police-courts of devout
church-members guilty of fraud and embezzle-
ment, and we have, in Norfolk Island, an entire
community suckled and spoon-fed for genera-
tions on Bible and hymn-book, who have be-
come so depraved as to require special policq
and magisterial regulation. The error is
common of regarding piety unaccompanied by
virtue as humbug. It is true good morals often
go with religion ; so does temperance ; so do
top-hats and many other things ; but the de-
votional and the moral instincts are so wholly
separate that there is absolutely no reason why
the man who lies and defrauds should not have
an honest desire for prayers and hymns and
exhortation, and there is no proof that he prays
and sings and exhorts merely to disguise
his iniquities. There is no reason why he
should not even commit murder on Wednes-
day and yet retain all his genuine love for
Sunday devotions. The idea that devotions are
a remedy for crime is based on the idea that
the two things can’t go together, whereas they
can and often do. It is also taken for granted
that the isolation of the bush tends to de-
pravity. It might with equal reason be said
to lead to asceticism, religious mania and
hysteria, for examples are common in each
direction. And Heaven itself would backslide
occasionally if its angels arrived there in chains
and leg-irons, aud the wonder is, in some of our
districts, not that criminals crop up from time
to time, but that, considering the seed sown,
criminals should be so rare. —H.F.
Premier Reid’s proposal that in the Federal
Senate one-half the members shall retire every
three years is a scheme for the perpetuation of
one of the very worst features of the Victorian
House of 48 Rich Landlords, which is about
the worst House in Australasia. By Reid’s
proposal the Federal Upper House would never
represent the popular sentiment of the day,
and it would never even agree in representing
the popular sentiment of the same yesterday.
At the best, half of it would represent the
feeling of the moment, and the other half that
of three years back ; at the worst half of it
would represent how the electors felt two years
and 11 months ago, and the other half how they
felt five years and 11 months ago. If the
country underwent a great revulsion of feeling
it couldn’t bring the Senate into line with it,
therefore it would lose interest in its Senate.
It could only have half an election at once, and
it doesn’t care for half an election anymore than
it wants to whistle to half a dog. And the
election, instead of coming by the ordinary
process of dissolution when the crisis was in
full blast and public interest was aroused,
would come at a set date every three years,
generally when there was a Sabbath calm in
politics and nothing was moving. The House
which has half or one-third or some other
fraction of an election every three or five or
more years is always one w'here public interest
is about nil, and where the same old fossils
come back practically unopposed year in and
year out.
“ F.” to The Bulletin
Brunton Stephens’ amusing skit on the A.N.A. may or
may not have serious motives behind it. Of course, put
baldly, the limitation of the title “Australian” to the
native-born is absurd —and, similarly, the claims of an
exclusive association to national character are open to the
jibe of wits. But there is practical sense behind the
limitation. (I cannot imagine how the Brunton Stephens
“hard case” could be legislated for.) The A.N.A. is a
product of Victoria, where the average age of the native-
born is comparatively low. A benefit society of the
native-born, therefore, means, in Victoria, a society of
“ good lives.” In some of the branches (there
are 130) the balance-sheets show accumulations of
sick and burial funds that are quite pathetic—for no one
ever dies or demands sick pay. The provision of “ bene-
fits ”is the fly-wheel of the A.N.A. Other organisations,
by scores, established for literary and political purposes,
have gone under. But in Vic. to-day the A.N.A. has
about 10,000 members and £56,000 of funds. It encour-
ages political and literary discussion—and for many years
has always had its representatives in Parliament. It is
not ideal. It runs a rather objectionable sort of lottery,
the motives being intermediate. It harbors a few cads
and boodlers —what big concern does not? But, after all,
the figures show that the number of eligibles to the
A.N.A., other than cads and boodlers, is not so very
small. At the 1891 census the native born in N.S.W.
comprised 72 per cent, of the whole; in Vic., 69 per
cent. ; in Queensland, 52 per cent. The average for Aus-
tralasia was 67 per cent. The percentage of “young
men ” who are native born must be very high. After all,
the A.N.A. is not so very limited—the extraordinary case
quoted by Mr. Brunton Stephens notwithstanding. Are
we not told of a similar case in history—where Queen
Victoria’s mother crossed the channel to England, so
that the “mere expectancy” might be English? I am
afraid Mr. Stephens will think I am a humorless person.
That great statesman, William M‘Millan, of
N.S.W., defines his position on an important
Federal question :
You cannot hand over to the Federal Government the
responsibility and control of the national debts, without
at the same time handing over the railways, which are
the most important asset. This, to my mind, is clear.
The due payment of interest depends entirely on the
economical and efficient management of the railways,
and no practical Government would allow itself to be re-
sponsible for the results of a business over which it had
actually no control There is undoubtedly
a great danger arising out of the local control of
railways, unless provisions, very difficult to frame, are
adopted as a part of the Federal Constitution. While
Freetrade between all the parts, as far as Customs duties
are concerned, might prevail, still by a system of bonuses
or differential rates, the railways might be used as a
practical protection of the commerce of one State against
another. . . . lam therefore opposed to any attempt
to include the absorption of the railway system in the
original constitution.
M'Millan, the Freetrader, is certain that the
railways ought to be federated. Also, he
recognises that if they are not federated it will
mean covert Protection. Likewise, he is in
favor of them not being federated. The little
tinkling importer believes in compelling the
N.S.W. trade to come to Sydney right
up against the door of his own big ware-
house. The blessed principle that trade should
be free and untrammelled may go hang except
when it means that trade should be free to go
to the city where M‘Millan’s warehouse is.
A Broken Hill correspondent to The Bulle-
tin :
It’s a bad thing when a law is passed whose operation
does not extend to the city : if Sydney suffered under the
N.S.W. Municipalities Act that mass of uncertainties and
imperfections would long ago have been superseded.
However, as the “ educated proletariat” in the country
is starting to pick holes in it and creep through them, re-
form will probably be hastened. The voting power is un-
certain. In Sydney both owner and occupier may vote ;
under the Municipalities Act “ occupier, owner and
lessee” may be enrolled; but only the one “who pays
the rates ” may vote. Still, as nobody can say for certain
when an enrolled person presents himself whether he has
paid the rates or not, he has to sign a declara-
tion setting out that he is a “ ratepayer ” in
respect of some particular premises ; and then there
is no power that can prevent the man voting ; so
the Full Court held in the Pte case. If he isn’t a rate-
payer, but has declared that he is, of course it is perjury.
During the last year or two the Labor-party in the bigger
provincial centres has been extending operations by
running municipal candidates, with the result, in some
cases, that owners and occupiers, landlords and tenants,
Conservatives and Labor men, have come in conflict. Not
often, though, has the tenant thought it worth while to
rush off wildly and pay up rates in order to get his single
vote ; so the landlord has done it instead—only more
leisurely. But now the “educated proletariat” has
started to argue the thing out. “ I pay the rent,” he
says ; “ old Jones has got nothing except rent; therefore,
he must pay the rates out of the rent. So I pay
the rates to him in instalments, and he hands
the money in at the office—except when he sticks to it, in
which case the council collars my furniture. Wherefore
I am the ratepayer.” Accordingly, having thus squared
his conscience, he proceeds to vote. But then, the land-
lord comes along and votes, too ; and the Act says that
only one shall vote. Things are therefore mixed, and
threaten to become still more mixed—unless a chance
prosecution straightens them out. At present, each side
is calling the other a shameless perjurer; but neither is
apparently quite sure enough about his own position to
sool the law on to the other.
“ H.” lo The Bulletin
Without a doubt, Q. party politics are shaking under-
neath. There is not only an apparent—some leaders say it
is only “ apparent” and that differences have been healed
—slump among Labor members, but the heterogeneous
conglomerate of the Ministerial phalanx is decomposing
into antagonistic atoms. Premier Nelson wants to quit.
Ten “ Ministerialists ” are named who are said to be will-
in" to coalesce with some of the Labor members—some
Labor members barred. The “ political association that
ran the elections for Nelson is, for all party purposes, as
dead as a moonstruck codfish. The P.U. and the
Federated Employers’ Association were known to have
put up a big purse for last election’s purposes. The
amount of this is variously stated, but the favorite
sum named is £12,000. This is said to have gone
slap-bang into the treasury of the Bolcock agency
and is further declared to have vanished—appar-
etdlv nnAly in “circulars.” The P.U. and the
F.L.A., “c., are " full up” of paying “subscriptions” to
a vanishing fund, and their present political attitude is
apathy. Now is the real time when the workers should
organise—ay, organise and cabal, if they see a road-open-
ing. Tozer is declared to be willing to buy them —poli-
tically buy them, of course. Question; Can the workers
buy up To/.kr —also, politically, of course ? Can they
afford to do it? Nelson is still in the “never mind"’
mood as regards everything. He is a master of laisaer
faire. And his own feeling really is—“ Never mind. If
you insist on me remaining Premier, well —mine’s whisky
and never mind. If you’ll let me go, well—never mind,
mine’s whisky.” Secret negotiations are at work, and
Tozer’S visit to Sydney was not altogether unconnected
with them.

Her Majesty’s (Sydney) groaned in every
tier beneath the crowd which rolled up on Satur-
day night to look on at the revival of the “ Silver
King.” That fine old play had a memorable
night out, and even in its newest days it couldn’t
have been much better reoeived, or much better
played. Scot Inglis, in The Bulletin’s opinion,
is the best Silver King Australia has yet seen;
even with silver at 2s. 6d. an ounce he lays over
all competitors. His youth gives him an advan-
tage even over Titheradge, who might otherwise be
ahead, and he leaves the rest of the dynasty of
the silver kings behind on general principles.
Inglis is at his best in Act 1, where Wilfred
Denver is an intoxicated dude going downhill in
a top hat to perdition. He is boozed with a
gentlemanly and realistic and experienced drunk;
even in his maddest zig-zags his Denver is
a picturesque character with vine-leaves in his
hair—not simply with beer in his feet, which is
quite a different thing. He is almost equally
brilliant in Denver’s other moods and circum-
stances, and, taken as a whole, the latest silver
king will keep ahead of most competitors. Some-
body presented a vast wreath to him when he
returned from Nevada, and he took it on his stick
and carried it away, with the bitter expression of
one who intended jumping on the vegetable as
soon as he got out of sight. Rumor has it that
Scot Inglis objects to be decked with the girly
garland, and promptly boots it into next
century when it is inflicted upon him.

Jaikes quite as well as that weary servitor
deserves. _ The aged retainer is always very much
the same.’ Denver alters greatly ; various actors
have made his age vary 40 years or more, and his
bulk ranges from 10 to 17 stone, but Dan’l
Jaikes is cast in a fixed mould, and his twinkling
legs are always about the same thickness, and the
back-view of him looks like the same inky cock-
roach all the time. Roberts is as good a Jaikes as
any other, and better than a great many. Cecil
Ward’s Spider is a new rendering. He is smaller
and milder than most of them, and treats his
accomplices not forcibly, but with a small voice
and a culchawed sneer. Barring a rather weak
and ineffective Father Christmas, the present co.
is about the best all-round combination which has
tackled the “Silver King” in Sydney. Little
Daisy Ireland deserves a special mention all to
herself, as a chi Id-actress who plays cleverly, and
doesn’t look at all like the usual laborious and
scared stage infant, and various other people who
also deserve mention are unavoidably held over.

For reasons that are about as indistinct as
Freeman Kitchen’s letters on Federation, “ Cheer,
Boys, Cheer,” comes to an untimely end this
week, after a season of 12 nights only, and that
great, gilded phantasmagoria, the “ Lights of
London,” rises out of its grave to put its ghostly
face in the Royal bill for Saturday. Why this
literary mammoth should come from its resting-
place now more than at any other time to gambol
in 187 acts beneath the moon isn’t especially evi-
dent ; probably it is because the Rignold season is
near its end, and the overgrown drama feels called
upon to lumber across the stage at least once,
merely as a matter of custom, before the end.
The Bulletin will view the departure of
“ Cheer, Boys,” with regret for several reasons,
but mainly for the sake of Miss Emily
Hughes, whose bright and breezy little widow
is a character to be viewed often and fallen
in love with violently. When that lady
rises up in defence of the slandered heroine and
denounces a room-full of the British aristocracy,
and when she desires to publicly belt Plimmer
with her umbrella, and, later on, when the
heroine’s character is all gone, and her defender
rises up and denounces the universe in general on
her behalf, and offers to belt the entire solar sys-
tem, she carries most of the drama on her two bare
shoulders, and carries it remarkably well. If
arrangements could be made for her presence in
the battle-scene, where she could hold the fort in
evening-dress with her parasol when everybody
else was down, the result would be simply over-
whelming. The Bulletin presents a portrait of
Miss Hughes on page 11 of this issue, partly in
consideration of her ability and partly because she
looks better than the portrait of the remarkable
oldest inhabitant, aged 105, and still in possession
of all his faculties, and able to distinctly remember
the time when he saw George Thornton receiving
Capt. Cook on Manly pier.

Frank Thornton is due at Sydney Criterion
on Saturday with the “ Strange Adventures of
Miss Brown.” That unusual female arrives with
strong recommendations from her last place in
Melbourne, and on the strength of these and
many previous testimonials she proudly puts down
her band-box and her goloshes in the hall of the
Btrange city, and leaves her boots out to be cleaned
wfth perfect confidence. Lohr acts as manager,
and is generally responsible for the lady’s safety
and well-being. The Brough Comedy Co. leaves
for Melbourne to fill Thornton’s vacant place at
the Bijou.

The announcement that Harry Rickards
had taken over Sydney Palace, vice Goatcher,
was only what everybody expected. The
fate of every variety house is obviously to
fall into the hands of the absorbent
Rickards sooner or later. The Palace and the
Tivoli companies are now getting mixed up and
re-assorted. “My Fancy,” the moderately sur-
prising dancer who formerly did her respectably
ordinary dance at the new house, has shifted along
to the old one, while Edgar Granville, Amy Dew-
hurst the “top-boot dancer,” and ventriloquist
Winton have been turned on at the Palace. The
decease of the pantomime having released Crackles
and Lawton, the latter is staged at the Palace,
and the former at the Tivoli. Charles Cogill and
Florrie Forde are at both houses simultaneously,
and the Amazonian ballet has been transferred to
the new venture, and the agile Manager Leete is
in both places at once. Otherwise the chief dif-
ference between them is that one gallery is 6d.
and the other Is.

Howells and Stevens have decided to
knock off concert business for a while, and in an-
nouncing the fact that they have had more than
enough bad luck to go on with, Howells was rough
on “musical Adelaide,” which used, as a rule, to
get first hearing of the imported artists. Santley
and Cyril Tyler showed a profit in Adelaide, but
all other companies engaged of late years were a
financial failure until they got along to Melbourne
and Sydney, where in some cases the Adelaide loss
was recovered (and yet the advance notices from
S.A. invariably told of enthusiastic receptions
from crowded audiences). Mr. Howells is very
sore, and with reason, on the subject of Mark
Hambourg’s cool treatment by the southern saints.
Mark’s weird, peculiar playing was a matter of
taste, but nobody could fairly deny his genius for
administering systematic punishment to the piano.
Adelaide set the unlovely youth down as a mere
“thumper” when he was, in good truth, a hurri-
cane fighter, and a scientist at that.
This is the last week, bar one, of “ Matsa”
at Melbourne Princess’s, although the demand for
that imposing spectacle remains healthy. After a
turn in the provinces, “Matsa” will arrive in
Sydney on Feb. 27, by which time, perhaps, sundry
members of the company will have been put
through a judicious course of galvanic baths, and
tonics taken internally. The Bulletin herewith
begs to mention that anything which is worth
doing at all is worth doing well, and if the leading
“ Matsa ” offenders don’t take the aged maxim to
heart when they make their new start, they may
expect to hear of something to their disadvantage
from several quarters.
* * • *
At the end of the “ Matsa ” run in Sydney
the Firm will organise a big specialty company,
including most of the people from their two pan-
tomimes, reinforced by importations from ’Ome.
The intention is to tour Australia with this new
arrangement of forces, making a particular feature
of the ballet. All the best dancing material at
W. & M.’s command is to be gathered together
into a ballet that shall surpass even the Blue
Ballet of three years ago, and leave nothing to be
desired by the most exacting and bald-headed
critic of the female leg divine.

Preparations for “The Prisoner of Zenda,”
which follows the panto, at Melb. Princess’s on
Feb. 13, are on something beyond the usual ad-
vertisement scale of splendor. Dresses alone
will cost <£lsoo or thereabouts, and by way of
convincing the public that there is no deception in
the matter, a collection of beauteous bodices, and
skirts guaranteed to trail six feet along the stage,
is now being exhibited at a local draper’s.
Also, a choice assortment of sassiety orna-
ments —Mrs. Maesmore MorriSfMiss Sutton, &c.
who have undertaken to wear purple and fine linen
in the forthcoming production, may be often seen
doing the Block in the meantime as a guarantee ot
good faith. For the parts that require acting
rather than raiment a company of seven has just
arrived —Miss Ada Ferrar the leading lady,
angelic Miss Elliot Page, Miss Mortyne, Messrs.
Hawtry, Gaston Mervale, Carvill and Julius
Knight, which latter was here some seven years
ago. “ The Prisoner of Zenda” promises to be an

“ For England’’—jingo libel on the apathetic

When they trot from Little Bourke-street through

Is still a great attraction, and a never-failing

Of pleasure for disciples of the ’urdle-jumpin’

The moonlit Abbey Ruins, where the villain finds
a way
To shift the angry parent of the girl who went
astray ;
The Rocky Pass at Somewhere, and the Strong-

And the dauntless British forces laying Dutch-
men’s courage low ;
The welcoming of Baker to the home where he
was born,
(Which marks the wicked majah, who is laughing
him to scorn,
And pouring forth the contents of his bitter,
wrathy vials
Till a Zulu money-lender comes along from Seven
Dials
To charge him with a murder, and arrest him for
a crime
That somehow didn’t get him into trouble at the
time).
Those scenes are well deserving of applause in any
case,
So we sing again their praises for the sake of filling

The whitening may be patchy or general; anaesthetic
lepers invariably whiten. Kipling speaks of the ‘ silver

The finale to the Goatcher season at Sydney Lyceum
occurred last Monday, when the effects of the manage-
ment were auctioned under distraint for rent. Proceed-

sparring and tinted language was indulged in by the
belligerents. After these warlike persons were repressed

Dear Bulletin, —“ Does it ‘ enchant ’to see a child,

prodigy. Alma Grey does not ‘ sing suggestive songs.’
She does not. She sang, ‘ Please buy me one like papa
had yesterday,’ at the Tivoli a while ago. But that is a
song the daughter of the day might take even her mother
to hear. It is the touching and simple chronicle of how

the hero to sit, with the heroine on his knee, in a faked
chair, which is really the seat of an electrocution ap-
paratus. By a machine accident the current is deviated
on to the villain himself, who squirms epileptically all
over the stage with burnt and distorted features. ‘ The
Serpent’s Coil ’ now retires into obscurity. Presently,
doubtless, Haleck patrons will rejoice to watch a baby
being eaten piecemeal by pigs and ravenous rats, or a
villain butcher made into pemmican—buttons, apron
and all—in his own sausage-machine, or a real dissecting-
room, wherein real medical students with real knives will

morning, before a packed fashionable and excited congre-

“Octoroon,”and furnished him with the mostthrillinginci-
dent. Having escaped from slavery, the girl was detained
at Washington, but allowed to go on parole to New York.
She was very religious, and undertook to go South again,
if not redeemed. Such was the confidence in her word
that the M'Closkey of this real drama gave 1200dol. for
her, but offered to let her go on being recouped. Beecher
stood her up before his congregation, and raised the
money.

James Ashton, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), pub-

Mr. Ashton, judged by his address and speeches,
is one of the straightest, most thorough-going,
most Australian, and least parochial of the candi-
dates announced up to date, and though The
Bulletin disagrees on one or two points, it
regards him as about the most promising man
who has yet come forward.
Speaker Joseph Abbott, of N.S.W., an-
nounces himself as a candidate for the Federal
Convention. His manifesto contains no state-
ment of his views on any single point, so the
people are invited to take him on trust, on the
grounds that he has been an M.P. for 17 years,
neaker for seven years, is a big boss Mason, head
man of the A.M.P. Society, and is 6ft. or
thereabouts in height. And The Bulletin’s
opinion is that even a man 26ft. 4|in. in height
shouldn’t be taken blindly in this fashion. There-
fore, it waits to hear something definite about the
lordly Abbott’s views.
What the Yictorian Conservative party

Agent-General would stand the chance of the
proverbial Buckley, though he could be easily
persuaded into a contest. At last St. Kilda fight,
barrister Fatman Coldham had the promises of
three-fourths of the electors, yet when the numbers
went up Coldham said in his speech that there
were more liars in St. Kilda than in any other
constituency in the universe.
Apropos L. F. Heydon’s proposals that, if
there must be a federation, which he strongly
objects to in any case, it shall only be for ten
years, so that N.S.W. can withdraw at the end
of that time if it wants to, instead of being
forcibly retained by the brute majority of the
other provinces. Supposing that Riverina or the
Barrier didn’t want to withdraw while Sydney
did, what is the difference between them being
forcibly dragged out by Sydney, or Sydney being
forcibly kept in by the other provinces ? Heydon
makes no provision for such a case. His provin-
cial idea of freedom, apparently, is only freedom
for the county of Cumberland to refuse the rest
of the province any freedom whatever.
Another collision at Redfern railway-
station, Sydney, arising in exactly the same
fashion as that of two years ago. One train was
coming in ; another was going out, and the latter
smashed into the first carriage of the train ap-
proaching. It tumbled over slowly, the roof came
off, and out fell the passengers higgledy-piggledy
—for all the world like the animals from an over-
turned Noah’s-ark. Luckily, neither train was
going at speed, and a few bruises were all the in-
juries—or all, at least, which the railway people
acknowledged to the reporters ; for Sydney rail-
way people are shrewd in their generation. The
accident draws renewed attention to the in-
adequacy of Redfern station for the traffic. If
Govt, does not move, to the cost of the new
station may any day be added <£loo,ooo damages
for a really big collision—the personal responsi-
bility for which will be not with the Commis-
sioners, but with the Ministry.
Phil May is now among the most-inter-
viewed of “ lions,” and many and various are the
yarns ascribed to him. May loves a joke, and the
temptation to draw the long-bow must be extreme
when still another scribe runs him to earth. But,
despite his exceptional popularity and success, May
is modest and generous, and would never have
sanctioned such a misleading yarn as was
published in a recent number of San Francisco
Argonaut, which stated that : “ He went to Aus-
tralia, and by his efforts raised the Sydney Bulle-
tin from an obscure paper to a wide circulation.
He then returned to London with a reputation.”
Little exception can be taken to the latter sentence,
but the first part is unjust and untrue. Several
years before Mr. May’s engagement, the “obscure”
paper had become such a pronounced success that
a representative visited America and England to
secure the services of a first-class artist, and had
the good fortune to engage Mr. Livingston
Hopkins, a caricaturist of top-rank in that city
of brilliant cartoonists —New York. With such
an accession the paper continued to increase in
circulation and popularity, and when it was
decided to further add to the strength of the
artistic staff, the then young and comparatively
unknown Phil. May was engaged, with the result!
that after four years he returned to London with
a much-enhanced reputation. No one has better
earned his great artistic fame than Phil,
May, and those who know him best know him to
be incapable of making or conveying such a boast
as has been attributed to him by the paragraph in
question.

The A.J.S. Bank’s balance-sheet is a tale of
woeful mishap. The loss for the half-year is £48,200.
Even the Commercial of Australia, in the very bad half-
year before its second reconstruction, only managed to
accumulate an avowed loss of £24,000, and the City of
Melbourne’s best effort —the one which broke it—was
under £20,000, so the A. J.S. has put up the record loss of
Australia in recent years. Last half-year it was announced
that “ the operations of the bank showed a net profit of
£23,264,” and though The Bulletin suggested, reading
between the lines, that this was really made by selling
the bank’s large holding of Consols and realising a big
premium t'hereon, nothing was said about it in the
balance-sheet at the time. Now it is acknowledged that
the profit was obtained in the way this paper suggested,
and that the ordinary “ operations of the bank ” showed
a loss of £B4oo—which is a very different impression from
that conveyed six months ago. For the half ended Deo.,
’95, the profit was returned at £25,825, so the slump in one
year (£74,000) is awful. Even this doesn’t represent the
whole trouble. A year ago there still remained £573,000
of the old bank’s reserves to cover depreciation in the
old assets. Six months ago there remained only £374,000,
go it appears that £199,000 went in depreciation in one
half-year. Now the remainder—how much it is doesn’t
appear—is said to be carried to a contingency account,
but as no contingency account appears among the
liabilities, this is probably much the same as a complete
writing off. If this is so, any further losses must come
out of the profits of the new bank —and the new bank has
a £48,000 loss just now instead of a profit. Considering
that the 4J per cent, deposits have been reduced during
the year by over £1,300,000, and a very large saving in
interest thus effected, even the low interest rates prevail-
ing hardly account for the drop, especially as most other
banks are showing a more or less marked improvement
just now.
The A. J.S. is now negotiating in England for a
reduction of interest on the remaining five millions of its
4$ per cent, deposits. But even if it gets a reduction to
3 per cent, the saving will be only £75,000 a year, while
the gap to be filled to make ends meet on the present
basis of things is £96,400 a year. Even a reduction to 2(
per cent., which looks too good to be hoped for, would
only, at the present rate, leave a margin of £3600 to cover
depreciation of the old assets—that depreciation which
apparently swallowed £199,000 in a single half-year. And
the board’s statement, that it “ continues to receive
advices which are considered favorable for a reduction of
the rate of interest ” doesn’t sound especially sanguine.
The business for the half-year shows an increase in note
circulation and a small reduction in current accounts. Cash
on hand is much the same, but cash and other liquid
assets combined (£1,374,468) are £58,000 better. There is
nothing very striking or definite about any of these
figures. The latest recorded sales of the shares (£7 10s.
paid up) were at the very humble figure of 15s. The
big item, “ bills receivable, bills discounted, and all
other debts and other assets, £7,139,357,” ought to be
interesting reading if the Victorian Companies Act
was in force in N.S.W., and it was necessary to show how
much of the mass consisted of foreclosed property, and
how much had been written off it for depreciation. The
present signs are that a great deal depends on the
negotiation now proceeding with the reconstructed
depositors, and if it doesn’t come off, or only comes off
on a very small scale, it looks as if the position might be
very serious indeed. Under all the circumstances, the
4 and 5 per cent, dividends which the A.J.S. paid so
gaily until a year ago look like very reckless financing.

The balance-sheet of the Queensland National
Bank is a disastrous and hopeless-looking document.
The half-year’s takings don’t cover working ex-
penses, and the loss is £1607. Last half there was
an alleged profit of £10,021, and the one previous a
dubious profit of £13,130, so the drop is something very
large. It is apparently brought about by the fact that
the recent Parliamentary investigation shut down, in part
at least, on the practice of showing profits by charging in-
terest which couldn’t be recovered upon advances that
were practically dead. During the half-year the cash and
State notes on hand at head office and all branches have
dropped from £1,998,000 to £838,000, and the total liquid,
or allegedly liquid, assets from £2,132,000 to £1,403,000.
This is a truly awful falling away. The “ deposits and
other liabilities” have diminished nearly £900,000, and, as
the Q.N. B. hasn’t released any of its reconstructed deposits,
it would seem that the public or the Government, or both,
have been rushing to get their loose money out of the ill-
fated institution, and that this is the cause of the reduc-
tion. There is a very small reduction in the advances,
possibly because the Q.N.B.’s advances are not of a kind
that can be easily realised, so the diminution in the
deposits is almos,t all represented by the fall of the liquid
assets. If the rush had continued at the same rate much
longer, and the. Nelson Government hadn’t come to the
rescue with a temporary State guarantee, it is interesting
to speeulate as to where the Q.N.B. would have gone to.
The auditors’ certificate is a bitter irony. A few
weeks back an independent investigation showed that
about £2,500,000 of the alleged assets were not assets at
all, but losses. Yet they appear in the balance-sheet
under the same old heading as actual property, and the
same two auditors certify in exactly the same old terms to
the correctness of the sheet which the bank itself acknow-
ledges to be a lie. That is to say, they state that “ it is
a full and fair one, exhibiting a true statement of the
affairs of the bank as shown by the books." The exact
value of that kind of auditors’-certificate is evident when
it is seen that it fits in just as well when the assets are
proved to be largely bogus as it did when they were still
professing to be good. If the new Victorian Act, under
which the manager, auditors, and two directors have to
swear that, to the very best of their belief, the balance-
sheet is a correct statement of affairs as they are, applied
in Queensland, either the Q.N.B. would have had its
revelations long ago, or a pretty comprehensive criminal
trial would be looming, or a lot more people would be
dead. A law which makes everybody concerned either
tell the truth or commit perjury in the broadest terms,
with a large gaol looming in front, has a lot of points
about it.

Some of the old Q. N. Bank directors have the
impudence to seek re-election, though the commission
report, if it did not convict them of knowingly paying
dividends to themselves from the funds of an insolvent
institution, certainly did convict them of gross incapacity.

The English, Scottish, and Australian Bank re-
ports a loss for the 12 months ended 30th June, 1896, of
£24,576. The 1895 loss was over £16,000, so things have
become a good deal worse within the 12 months. In
1894 there was a profit of £10,153, therefore the E.S.
and A. has gone backward considerably for the past
two years. Since June, ’96, however, the new arrange-
ment with the depositors has come into force. Under its
provisions the institution saves £15,000 a year interest
for certain, and can cut down interest in case of necessity
so as to save another £45,000, making £60,000 in all. If
the drop in profits continues at the present rate for two
years more the whole £60,000 relief will be wanted ; but
this seems hardly likely, and according to present appear-
ances the E.S. and A. has now a sufficient margin to
keep it square. The shareholders’ prospects, however,
are about as poor as they well can be ; things
will have to improve £70,000 a year before even 5
per cent, will be visible on the far horizon, and the next
dividend looks many years off. English management, as
shown in the case of the E.S. and A., looks no better
than the ordinary every-day Australian article. In two
years the institution only reduced its reconstructed
deposits by £179,609, which is very little off £4,000,000.
It has a capital of £971,000; no reserve-fund ; an accu-
mulated loss of £34,000 ; a very moderate new business,
and an expense rate which is a lot heavier than that of
the Victoria or Commercial of Australia—both consider-
ably larger concerns. Also, some of its deposits are sell-
ing as low as 12s. in the £, and its shares seem to have no
market-value in particular—in Australia, at all events.

The Australian Widows’ Fund presents a mode-
rate-looking report for the year ended 31st October, ’96.
Renewal premiums (£137,518) are nearly £2OOO less than
for the previous year, £BOOO less than for ’94, and £15,000
less than for ’93. New premiums (£13,236) are £l2OO
better than last year, and £3OOO better than ’94 or ’93, so
the total premium income since ’93 has gone down about
£12,000. Interest on investments (£56,536) is £3OOO more
than last year, but £lOOO less than for ’94, despite the fact
that the funds were then much smaller. The rate of
interest earned is now only £4 Bs. per cent, per annum ;
whereas in ’93 it was as high as £5 ss. The total income
(£213,879) is £7OOO better than in ’9s—which is something ;
and £BOOO worse than in ’93—which isn’t very much. The
expense rate is about the worst feature in the Widows’
Fund. It got down, in ’93, to 22 per cent, on premium
income. It ascended to nearly 27 per cent, in ’95, and in
’96 it is only down a very small fraction below 25 per
cent. The “properties acquired by foreclosure” now
represent £61,000 against £24,000 a year ago, so the
society has evidently had none too good luck during the
year. The amount saved and added to the funds is
£68,000, whereas in ’93 it was £lOO,OOO, loss of business by
surrenders and lapsed policies being the chief cause of
the trouble. Also, the quinquennial report shows a very
big writing off to cover depreciation during the last five
years—exact amount not known as the document hasn’t
come to hand, but said to be enough to swallow up most
of the bonus.
The general result is that the Widows’ Fund is
a respectable, decently-managed office with nothing sen-
sational about it, and suffering a good deal from over-
much competition. The assets look good enough,
and there is nothing suspicious to be noted about any of
the items in the balance-sheet. If the Widows’ Fund
could arrange an amalgamation with another office
equally solid and respectable and slow-going, and thereby
greatly reduce the expense account of both of them, it
wouM be a good thing. Too much insurance offiee in
proportion to population is the chief cause of big expense
ratios in Australia, and the big expenses keep bonuses
low—or premiums high, which is practioally the same
thing.

On two consecutive days recently the loans made
by S.A. State Land Bank totalled £4695. Business is
steadily improving, and even the most Tory scoffer of the
crowd has almost ceased scoffing at the Kingston Govern-
ment’s Socialistic experiment. In another year the
chances are that Copley and his crowd will be heard
stating that they advocated the State Land Bank all
along.
* * * *
One of the favorite points of N.S. W. anti-
Federal orators is that their own province pays a lower
rate of interest on its debts than does any of its neigh-
bors, therefore a pooling of liabilities means a loss to
N.S.W. The statement is true enough in a sense, but it
doesn’t necessarily follow, as alleged, that the credit of
the mother province is much better than that of its
neighbors. In 1884 interest dropped from 4 per cent, to
3)4- In 1896 it dropped to 3 per cent. The province
that has borrowed most furiously since 1884 made the
biggest reduction in the average rate of interest over its
whole debt. N.S.W. has borrowed harder since ’B4 than
any other province, and about as hard as any other two
provinces, having added 30 millions to its debt in 12 years,
hence its average interest rate is lowest. If it had bor-
rowed 60 millions at the recent reduced rates it would
have been lower still, and if it had raised 120 millions in
’96 when the 3 per cent, rate came in, its average rate of
interest would be a lot lower again. That is the beginning,
middle and end of the mystery.

The Victorian State Land Bank sold its first
£25,000 worth of 3 per cent, bonds in Melbourne at about
£lOO Is. The transaction got through, however, by the
skin of its teeth ; the public only took £21,625, and the
Savings Bank made up the rest. Three per cent, is
cutting things a shade too fine —or at least quite fine
enough. Even J. Bull is not taking any 3 per cent,
securities at a premium with no certainty of long cur-
rency, and the attempt to cut the local investor below
the British one is wholly unjustifiable. When money
gets just a shade less plentiful in Melbourne, the necessity
for making future issues at Z\ will probably become
apparent.
The Southern Insurance Co. (Melbourne) has
apparently struck another patch of disaster. It started
the half-year with a credit to profit and loss of £27,017,
and ended it with only £25,495, so that the loss on six
months work is £1522. Then the co. pays alO per cent,
dividend (£2500), making the total loss £4022. Further,
£5OOO has been taken from reserves to form a fund to
cover depreciation of securities, and all these things com-
bined make a pretty bad slump for one half-year. The
record for four successive half-years is as follows :
(1) The Southern made a loss of £1393, and paid
£2500 dividend on top of it ; (2) The profit
was £1689, and the £2500 dividend paid as usual
converted it into another serious loss ; (3) The profit was
£3432, and after paying £2500 div. there remained £932 ;
(4, present half-year) The loss is £1522, and the £2500
dividend is paid once more, making the loss £4022. Total
for two years, £7794 lost through paying dividends that
were not earned, and £5OOO taken from reserves to cover
depreciation. How long does the board imagine that even
a big and solid co. can go on at this rate ?
* * * *
North Coast (N.S.W.) Steam Navigation Co.
has £3764 profit for the half-year and pays a 6 per cent,
dividend (£3652). The balance of £ll2 goes to reserve ;
total reserves now a little over £lB,OOO. Barring the fact
that the £40,000 mortgage on the co.’s wharf doesn’t seem
to have shifted at all, and that a £40,000 mortgage seems
a pretty heavy encumbrance when “wharf and other pro-
perty ” are only valued at £77,000, there is nothing of
special interest to
The bland enquiry, “Isn’t that sweating?”
made by old Doctor Youl, Melb.’s comic coroner, at
the inquest on the murdered Brady, was strongly to
the point. The head of the firm which had employed
both the deceased and the prisoner was giving evidence.
Brady he said, had been in the employ about 15 years,
and at the time of his death was drawing £3 10s. a week
—for working from 9 to 6 in the daytime, “ going back ’
at night on an average three times a week, and being the
confidential clerk of the concern. Phillips was but a
comparative novice ; he had been in the place only a
trifle of five years or so, and consequently he was getting
but half-a-sovereign a week. The question that the
coroner put was on the tip of everybody’s tongue. The
witness or the firm or somebody evidently felt a little
ashamed over the wages paid, for in the information sup-
plied to the newspapers at the time of Phillips’ arrest
Brady’s earnings were given as £4 10s. and Phillips’ as
17s 6d But when the firm got into the box and had to
depose’ on oath to the facts of the case, the accountant’s
screw fell £1 suddenly, and the youth’s diminished by 37£
per cent. , , , ,

The Australian Trading World is a little
I rind on sheet whose time and space are largely devoted
to the humming of certain W.A. and N.S.W. mines. The
Painbula Gold Mines, Ltd., appears to be a special favorite.
“ Two bulk assays made by the N.S.W. Govt, yielded—(a)
gold, 60oz. 19dwt. ; (B)gold, 620 z. 7dwt. per ton.” The
mining manager has been instructed to “ ship home at
once a couple of tons of this ore.” Why not a couple of
thousand ? Of course, it is proposed to increase the
capital “in order to fully equip and work the mine.”
Holders are advised to stick to their shares, “certainly
not to sell at par or anything near it.”
* • * »
From Grafton (N.S.W.) : “The escort from
Bucca Creek brought two cakes of gold from the Beacon
mine, but no information was given as to weight. It is
said to be 1600 oz.” The mine is known to be looking re-
markably well —so well that the chances are beginning to
look favorable for the Exploration Co. pulling out well on
the deal, though it will take a lot of gold to do it. A good
example has been shown in the remarkably quick way
the co. got things going.

Amos Gold Mining Co., N.S.W., decided to do

Birthday, Parkes (N.S.W.), reef, said to be 7ft.
wide and shows payable gold, upwards of 500 tons of stone
at grass and a 10-head battery nearing completion. The
best confirmation of all this is the share market, the value
of the mine having more than doubled within the last two
months.
* * * *
Mt. Drysdale, N.S.W. : “The Drysdale mill is
still running on better stone than for some time past.”
Faint hope. It would be more to the point to say :
“ There is still a chance of striking in this mine another
wonderfully rich streak, or chimney, of ore, such as sent
the shares up to £BOO before it duffered out. Whereupon
the boom departed, and desolation has reigned in the
camp ever since.”
* * * *
New Bushman’s—Parkes, N.S.W. The chair-
man : “ There was nothing exceedingly rich in sight, but
he had no hesitation in saying that the mine looked
better to-day than it did six months ago. He
thought when the mine got into full swing again they
would not be more than £lOO in debt.” He might also,
in common fairness, have explained that what had been
foreshadowed by the D.T. special mining reporter, was
exactly what had happened, despite his own declarations
to the contrary. A newspaper can tell as many lies as it
likes in favor of a mine, and be applauded for it; but let
it tell the truth against a mine and a howl of discontent
follows, as in this particular instance.

Wentworth mine, N.S.W., owner J. Bull, no
div. last six months, although the gold won for the year
amounted to 16,5240 z. Record for five years —gold,
104,8240 z. ; divs, £250,000. The chairman, Earl Kil-
morey, is coming out to see to things. This co. is also
working some leases in the Stuart Town camp, and has
already cause to regret it. The Aladdin’s Lamp, an off-
shoot, paid £40,000 in divs. during the year, making
£140,000 for four years. When the Wentworth mine was
floated some six years ago, there was absolutely no
payable ore in sight, though the prospectus and ex-
perts did not exactly say so. Tens of thousands were
spent before any was found, but when discovered,
the ore chutes were rich enough for anything, including
white-washing.

Prospectus of the Mount Ada Gold-Mining Co.,
Kanowna (W.A.), is advertised in The Bulletin. The
property covers 36 acres, situated within 2J4 miles of the
Kanowna railway that is to be, and 14 miles from the pre-
sent terminus at Kalgoorlie. Four reports on the exten-
sive lode formation, and bulk samples assayed therefrom
hold out gorgeous hopes to the investor —in fact, Mr. F. G.
de Visme Gipps, M.E., states, in a confidential whisper, as
it were, that he can strongly recommend the Mount Ada
to any personal friends who may be listening. The vendor
wants 60,000 shares and £3OOO cash. 50,000 are offered to
the public to be issued as f ully paid up upon payment of
3s. on appli. and 3s. on allot. Why they should be called

the enigma is of no consequence.

“A good strike has been made in the Great
Boulder 200 ft. level. A wide lode west of the main lode
has been met with.” They never weary in telling all about
that the public are not so very anxious to know. Where
is the lode at the 300 ft.? Has it been struck? If not,
why not ?
* * * *
Great Boulder Main Reef (W.A.) : 259 tons,
2280 z. “ The poorness of the yield is due to gold being
free only in part, while the tellurides were not saved.”
Any excuse for a poor crushing. And why were the tel-
lurides not saved ? The fact is that the Boulder lode is
much poorer before it reaches the Main Reef boundary, a
circumstance known to all who have examined the parent
mine, and the telluride ores are neither as rich nor as
plentiful as the public have been led to think.

“Three shafts on Hannan’s Proprietary Develop-
ment Co.’s blocks are to be sunk at once to a depth of
1000 ft.” Doubtful if they will go down as fast as the

and has spent a mint of money. Last year the shares
were £2 above par. in London; they are now some
shillings below par.

Queensland Menzies’mine, W.A., seems always
in some trouble. This time a mistake of IOOOoz. was
made in the crushing (that number above the actual
yield), which was 21320 z. from 392 tons. The truth was
good enough in all conscience. Then comes along a
statement that the pan-slimes and tailings will bring the
average up to 7oz. A div., the first, of Is. declared, and
the shares have dropped several shillings. A 3 usual, ex-
pectation and realisation.

Ivanhoe, W.A., fortnight—666 tons, 13860 z., a

Coolgardie wire:—“Hit or Miss. The results

Exemption from labor-covenants has always
been the burning question of Westralia, more so than in
all the other fields of Australia. Why ? No mine can pos-
sibly become rich under exemption. The Govt., of course,
is fencing the question. The Mines-Minister, to an oppos-
ing deputation It was the policy of the Govt, to do
everything possible to encourage development, but the
interests of capital must also be considered. He held a
letter from a large English co. threatening withdrawal
from the country if exemption were not granted, and,
under such circumstances, it would not be wise to force
them. How many similar letters is he likely to get?
Where the grounds urged were genuine, or not sufficient,
exemption would not be granted. Sheer humbug. If this
policy were enforced, there would be more leases forfeited
in W.A. this year than new ones taken up.

Burbank’s No. 1 West. Cable published in

are squared up the co. will have a block 280 ft. long by
70ft. in height to break out ere reaching the level above.

Faded Garden Gully United has a more hopeful
note in its report. Besides getting the extension of
the golden stone which went underfoot at 2245 ft. the co.,
at 2320 ft., has cut a promising make, and is preparing to
exploit it at a deeper level. Also, a thin reef at 860 ft. is

share. Mill drawing its chief supply from the 660 ft.
spurry formation, 30ft. to 40ft. wide. Below 770 ft. pros-
pects dicky, which explains why the co. thinks it inad-
visable to test the deeper ground. While there may be a
gbodish bit of stone in the payable stopes, scrippers
should scarify the directors for not pushing on prospect-
ing w@rk. Bendigo’s good old motto : “ Rake out the

Co. fooling around at too shallow a level (1900 ft.),
instead of deepening 200 or 300 ft. more, where the prospect
of cutting the northern run of Long Tunnel stone would
seem an absolute certainty. Yet hope, though, that the
6ft. stone recently cut in the 1900 ft. north level may
develope well, but if that does not happen the co. will
proceed to sink 200 ft. —which means five months’ work—
and then to drive 500 ft. or 600 ft. for the reef. None of the
L.T. reef drives are within 500 ft. of the N.L.T. boundary,
so it is impossible to be explicit about the small bit of
thin reef the latter has in its south level.

not flourish much outside Melbourne. A venomous
correspondent sends to The Bulletin from an
Australian capital an account of the Anniversary
Day dinner of the local branch :
It was sparsely attended, and the President arrived late,
hot and out of breath, with sundry bulky newspaper par-
cels under his arm, which, when they came in contact
with each other, emitted a melodious clink, pleasant to
the ears of the expectant A.N.A. When unwrapped these
parcels were seen by the breathless diners to contain the
“liquor” for the evening—a donation from the Presi-
dent, as he took good care to announce. The “liquor”
consisted chiefly of lager beer and one bottle of that
variety of gin known as “ squareface,” and it was hailed
with delight by the A.N.A. The President was disgusted
to find that they had been unable to restrain their
appetites pending his arrival, and vented his spleen upon
them by attacking the gin with some ferocity. Then the
beer was passed round, and the President could not be
prevailed upon to part with the “squareface” until the
beer was finished ; then, after having poured out a bum-
per for himself, in apparent fear that he would never see
it again, he handed it over to the tender mercies of the
others. While the gin was going round
But this is rank blasphemy. The Bulletin is
full of patriotism, even if it isn’t full of gin, and
will stop the venomous correspondent right here.
On second thoughts, The Bulletin is very “ full ”
of Patriotism.

Melb. : “Last night I dropped into the
Church of England Chinese mission church, Little

emanating chiefly from young ladies, each teach-

over 20, each with a sleek Chow beside her. Other
Celestials had to be content with older ladies, and
some with men. Imagine the disgust of those

Ovariotomy is now performed
(writes “ A Travelling Australian ”) in
the London hospitals for cancer of the

cancer of the necessary nourishing pas-
ture. Should this treatment prove a
success, a formidable female curse will

Acting-Gov. Madden, presiding over the

pathetic sight. He stood awhile in the centre of
the arena, with redhot sunshine streaming down
upon his belltopper, a person of no importance
beside the unlovely candidates who mustered on
the track. His position was so utterly destitute
of pomp and circumstance that he presently
flopped down upon one of the few chairs present—
a hard, wooden-bottomed, armless chair, manufac-
tured for kitchen purposes. Madden’s coat-tails
hung casually over the sides of this vulgar piece of
furniture as lie sat there, trying to make the best
of an undignified job. Once or twice he seemed to
be considering whether it were possible to re-
arrange himself effectively, but, the case being
palpably hopeless, he gave up the idea, and lapsed
into pensiveness. He was, perhaps, forming a

An amateur entertainment at Frankston
(Melb.) the other Saturday amounted to very
little more than a Madden show, inasmuch as 11
artists on the programme included nine relatives,
by blood or marriage, of the dapper Acting-Gov.
Half-a-dozen Misses Madden took the stage
upon this amazing family occasion, with the cus-
tomary family assurance. Three of them gave a
capital terpsichorean display of those limbs known
as legs in unrefined circles, so now the world

papa Madden that a girl’s greatest glory is plump-

The medical superintendent
of a W.A. mining township hos-

erratic in his conversation, and
‘smiles so seraphically, that the
sole impression left upon the
maiden’s mind was his gorgeous
generosity. She returned not, and
the doctor, after waiting an hour,
opened his door to cooey. Judge

he beheld Jemima attired in a

was tempered by his belief in ata-

ing down the corridor of the past
saying, ‘As he is, you were ; as he

That orful tragedy at a Melbourne iron-
monger’s shop has added new terrors to death by
murder. In support of Phillips’ story re his vic-
tim’s wild career among women (the victim’s
salary, by the way, has been toned down to 70s.
per week) the ’Erald published a crazy-looking
letter from an alleged female describing her (?)
virtuous struggle with the deceased “tempter,”
and relating other incidents that either happened
in the writer’s diseased imagination, or were in-
vented with ulterior motives. At one point the
epistle states that “he (Brady) often sent poor
Willie Phillips with presents and letters urging
me to meet him (secretly). He tried by anger and
persuasion and neglect to see if he could gain his
ends, but, thank God, I was firm to a loving
mother’s teachings.” Herein is the cue for
poor Willie Phillips to add a postscript to
his confession, so the following extract from
the ’Erald deserves to be read carefully.
“Having succeeded in obtaining this strange
letter, a representative of the Herald was deputed
to see Mr. Pitcher, managing clerk for Messrs.
Fink, Best, and Hall. That gentleman, while ex-
pressing surprise* as to how it had come into our
possession, admitted that it had been received.
Asked whether Willie Phillips had been questioned
as to the woman referred to in the communica-
tion as having lectured Brady on the error of his
ways, Phillips replied that he could not recall any
particular woman who would answer the descrip-
tion, but would think over the matter.” Whilst
poor Willie is thinking over this matter The
Bulletin would like to suggest the propriety of
forming a league for the Protection of Dead Men’s
Characters from irresponsible slander. What a
pity it is that the late Brady can’t suddenly turn
up to identify his own corpse as that of his twin
brother, and reap swingeing damages from a fine
crop of libel actions !

circulation over the confession of Phillips. Surely
an editor or proprietor must be an enemy of
society, and not in the beneficent sense of Ibsen’s
man.”

X.: “The futility of supposing that the aver-
age policeman or detective will ever find anything
if left absolutely to himself has been once more
shown during the forage for the Butler victims.
Lee Weller’s body was found by two bush-
geographers, who put two and two together and
walked straight to the spot. Previous to which
the mighty foot of the ambulatory ‘copper’ had
been covering the adjacent country without result
for many days. The latest ‘ find ’at Parkes was
located by a small boy hunting for bees’ nests.
The thrown-up soil was staring everyone in the
face, and the boy had only to investigate it with a
twig and the murder was out. Nevertheless,
‘ The police of Forbes sub-district had thoroughly
searched the neighborhood, and must haVe passed
within 20 yards of the spot where the body lay
hidden.’ They were probably looking for a
‘due.’”
The police found Preston, the best-planted of all
Butler’s corpses to date, entirely “ on their own ; ”
but. as this fact spoils “X.’s” argument, it'is
omitted. Lee Weller was found by a local resi-
dent, who knew the country, and who had seen
Butler near the spot a day or two before the
murder. As the police had vague and conflicting
information to guide them, and necessarily couldn’t
have such a clear idea of Butler’s whereabouts as
the local resident past whose house he had
travelled, they probably did as well as “X.”
would have done in the circumstances. The
Forbes police had a district of say 50 square miles
to search; it is pitted all over with prospectors’
heaps ; and, in 50 square miles, they failed to

At Maldon(Vic.),
recently , an unmarried
lady suicided by gun-
shot while the rest of
the family were away
at a picnic. Whether
she did it through
melancholy at being
left out of the bun-
struggle on the damp
grass, where the worm
always gets into the
salad, isn’t known.
The case is remark-
able chiefly because it
is very rarely indeed
that a woman guns
herself to death;
drowning and poison
are the regular me-
thods by which women
make their exit from
this world, but drown-
ing in well-watered
regions is a long way
ahead. In arid Aus-
tralia, however, the
suicidal lady often
finds that there isn’t
sufficient water avail-
able, unless she gets
rid of her soul in
some b o d y’s water-
tank, which leads to
ill-feeling, and is in-
jurious to the drink-
ing supply —to say
nothing of the fact
that the hole at the
top of a tank is not
large enough to let a
bustle through con-
veniently. Also, Aus-
tralia is a land of vast
distances, where the
chemist’s shop is often
a long way off; con-
sequently the Austra-
lian woman shoots her-
self oftener than most
women. And, judging
by the records, this is
almost the only country where the average woman
is a good enough shot to hit her own head once in
seven tries. In other countries, she mostly breaks
all the pictures and cripples the cow, and comes
out of the fray herself undamaged.

A short time ago, Balmain
was athrob with the vexations of a
conflict between members of friendly
societies and ministers of churches
over the Hospital Sunday-parada
question. The Sunday afternoon
display in the name of charity was
denounced by the clerics, who, find-
ing that the society-men were deter-
mined to hold to the custom of years,
inaugurated an opposition show on
their own account on a Saturday.
They were determined that the
sanctity of the Sabbath and the at-
tendance at the Sunday-schools
should not be tampered with. Thus
the hospital benefited from two
sources instead of one. But the
consistency of the antagonists to
Sabbath desecration has been ab-
ruptly upset by the publication of a
small hand-bill, announcing that
one of the clerios aforesaid would,
on a given Sunday, deliver a special
address to bicyclists at the close of
a cycle parade—proceeds in aid of
the hospital! This is investing the
bicycle with spiritual virtues hither-
to unthought of. Friendly-society
men might placate the clergy next
year by holding a cycling procession
in place of the customary march-past
with flag and drum.
An enterprising impresario lately ob-
tained a consignment of Japanese ladies and
opened a palin-reading business in South Brisbane

and, mustering a few bye-laws, hied him to the
scene. He found the tone of the house to be
blandly genteel; but as the only English which
the Nipponites could manage was—“ All li; ten
silling ; come agen,” a dark suspicion disturbed
the Mayor’s soul, and the strangers were emptied
out of the locality.

A man was arrested on a just-arrived M.L

Last week, too, at Perth, W.A., one Baker first
tried to shoot Miss Silvester, a barmaid, and then
hacked her throat badly. Barmaids are deadly :
it is probably the combination of wine and women
that makes the trouble.

The story of the £5OOO gold-robbery from
the Oceana at Melbourne is another commentary
on the already well-understood fact that if you
hang a bag of gold on a large shrub in
a public place it will quite probably go a-rnis-
sing. The gold - room of the Oceana was
approached by two hatchways, and the chief
officer kept the keys—hanging on a nail in his
cabin. The keys of the gold-room itself were
in the care of the captain, but whether he
habitually left them on the bowsprit or whether
they were kept in the coal-bunker doesn’t appear.
The locks on the gold-room were apparently
nothing in particular, for they were burst open
with a small crowbar “ without much force.” The
key of one hatch went a-missing off its nail, but
though there was £209,000 on board, and the
missing key gave comparatively easy access to
it, no one seems to have worried in the least.
After this it would appear that the only really safe
way to convey bullion is to carry it in the lee
scuppers ; the gold-room with its lock which can
be burst open with a crowbar, and the hatch with
one lost key and the other key hanging con-
veniently on a nail, are a howling mockery.
SERENADE.

With moonlight as coverlet,
And the night-winds weave rare dreams that
Fold the sleepers in their net.
On such nights of old came lovers
Singing their faint serenades,
And the sweetest music idled
To the ears of listening maids.
And I would, amid these drooping
Trees- that tremble, sigh and start,
Tune a mandoline to whisper
The song throbbing in my heart,
So that in your heart an echo,
Love of mine, might swoon to-night
Of this exquisite pain of loving
And this torture of delight.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, Feb. 2, 1897.
My Dear Myee—
The Victoria Club, in a respectable, hesitating
way, is “ taking up” theatrical stars. On Friday
last, Mrs. and Mr. Brough (the “ Mr.” is only an
appendage in a woman’s club) were entertained at
an afternoon swarry; also, Miss Austin, Miss
Temple and Mr. Titheradge. Women’s idea of
entertaining is filling small rooms insufficiently
ventilated with an extra-large-sized crowd, shut-
ting doors and windows, and generally playing
Black-hole of Calcutta. To keep up the tempera-
ture, hot tea and coffee are turned on at intervals,
and the subsequent groans of the victims are
sternly repressed while music plays.
There was a large, admirably-arranged pro-
gramme of events which did not come off. The list
of non-starters included Mr. Sid. Long and Mr.
Lambert, who would have done a lightning-sketch
if there had been space to rear an easel up. As a
brains-and-beauty show the gathering was fairly
representative. The all-admired Mrs. Brough was
youthful in a black silk skirt and an irrelevant
bodice of rosy satin veiled with black. Some
women gave away their age recklessly by wearing
low collars and laying bare the year-tallying lines
which the neck shows relentlessly. The pro-
prietress was gay in grass-lawn, and the hon. sec.
wore bronze silk with daisies.
The last but one of the “pleasant Saturday
afternoons ” arranged by the Society of Artists in
the Temperance Hall, Pitt-street, was held on
Saturday. A satisfactory section of the public
drifted in and was entertained with tea and con-
versation, music and sketching. Next Saturday
the drawing for the Art Union will take place, and
agitated subscribers will then know for certain
who has won the peacock-blue corrugated iron
roof in the yellow landscape, and the overworked
lavender pair of boots, and Pyrmont Bridge on
Judgment Day, and all the other pictures.
A solemn function occurred at Her Majesty’s
Theatre on Thursday evening, when the prizes
won at Anniversary Day regatta were presented
to winners by the Mayor in presence of a crammed
house adorned with a solitary banner inscribed
with a gigantic “ Q ” thrown over the d.c. railings
like a life-buoy. There was a painful pause in the
course of Act 3, and a long train of notables filed
sorrowfully on the stage and gazed with fixed
smile on the footlights, while his Worship ladled
out compliments all round in a tragic way as if he
were understudying the Silver King’s soliloquy, but
forgot his lines when he spoke about the successful
regattas and had to be prompted by the sec. from
behind. The Commodore of the P.A.Y.C. showed
much white vest and expansive smile, and slapped
his neighbor’s back; but every one felt it was
hollow mirth, and when the procesh gave three
stifled cheers and all shuffled nervously off again
the audience gave a sigh of relief and felt that
the worst was over.
Several performers at Miss Beatrice Griffiths’
concert at the Town Hall on Anniversary night
failed to turn up, but the blanks in the programme
were filled in with encores. The three sisters
Griffiths made very blushful and modest appear-
ances, and the eldest is one of those infrequent
girls who distributes for publication a photo, of
herself which doesn’t do her justice. Her tiny
hands thundering on the key-board are as surpris-
ing as a butterfly working a hand-organ. The
audience consisted mostly of girls, all wearing hats
looking as if they came out of the basket labelled
“ marked down, seized by the bank” in front of
an insolvent draper’s. Next day the same sort of
demonstrative farewell was given at Circular Quay
to the pianiste, who departed for Europe to
have the rest of her musical education made in
Germany.
Two cycling celebrities lately in Sydney nearly
had their life-friendship wrecked owing to the
same old cause. Only the cause isn’t very old in
this case, and has large, round, black-edged blue
eyes, reddened cheeks, and tow-colored, touzled
locks, and such a voice as the public imagines the
Swanhilda’s captain uses when expostulating with
his crew. And the two went every night to hear
her sing and see her dance, and tried to be first in
with bribes of oysters and champagne, until No.
1, who felt he was making all the running, grieved
to see that No. 2 was still imagining himself “ in
it,” and told him kindly, but firmly, that the
charmer was going to meet him (No. 1) that very
night when the theatre was out. Then No. 2
produced a scrawly note making an appointment
with him for the same time. So they agreed to
wait for the false one and have it out. But a cab
was waiting at the stage-door containing a power-
ful-looking No. 3, with whom the damsel drove off
without glancing at the two men who were left
lurking in the shade. Then they shook hands
feelingly, had a drink together, and lived happily
ever after.
In “ Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” at the Royal, there is
one opportunity of dress display in the ancestral
halls of Chepstow, where the naughty Lady
Kesteven, with the unspellable front name, is
ousted from her possessions by the rightful heiress,
in a chest-revealing black satin. Aristocracy on
the stage ascends as the frock edge descends ; the
higher the title the lower the gown. A duchess
on the boards usually badly wants a chest-pro-
tector. The guests standing around, in the scene
where Blanche is hurleCk from society, take it all
out in stage jewels and a haughty sweep of their
trains at the supposed guilty girl, and express
their smothered emotions by opening and shutting
their fans excitedly.
One of the two fortunate legatees of a recently-
deceased wealthy widow used to be a folder in the
office of a defunct Melb. newspaper. He was met
in the street a few days ago, and congratulated on
his luck by a former reporter on the same paper.
The legatee thanked the poor pressman, and, after
some condescending remarks, said, “ I must leave
you, dear boy, here is my carriage,” and a mag-
nificent vehicle and pair drove up and bore off the
well-gilt inheritor, who now shares with his sister
a newly-attained family-crest and an annual
.£40,000. The latest matrimonial prize has an
honorary billet as inspector under the Fisheries
Act, and was instrumental in getting 3d. a head
placed on cormorants, the fishes’ enemy. He is a
teetotaller, and owns a paying brewery.
Bathers in the Bondi baths one ladies’day lately
observed an altercation going on in the dim dis-
tance between the caretaker and an apparently
obtrusive stranger who wished to enter. They
would have been much fluttered had they known
that the intruder was an enterprising, up-to-date
Chinaman armed with a kodak who wanted to
come in and snap-shot the bathers. He made bis
request with much guilelessness, and seemed be-
wildered and hurt when repelled with great re-
pulsion.
The latest exports from Sydney are two beau-
teous creatures from a city hotel shipped to Wes-
tralia with fabulous stipends to increase the
attractions of Wallace Brownlow’s Kalgoorlie
palace. King Hongree is doing things in a mag-
nificent way over there ; his waiters look like first-
class stage menials, and in his new r6le he is as
popular as ever, and less harassed by sentimental
notes from adoring females, which was one of the
reasons alleged for his leaving the boards.
An amateur tenor on a moonlight harbor ex-
cursion was pouring forth his soul in “Maud,”
and passionately warbled “ Shine out little head,
running over with curls.” Nobody laughed,
because nobody ever does listen to a song; but
“ running ” instead of “ sunning ” is about as bad
a break just there as could be made.
In a fashionable Sydney feeding-place there is
a large glass skylight in the roof. Just under it
one afternoon an elegantly-tailored johnny was
sitting, drinking tea with a girl. There was a
low growling and scuffling on the roof, which the
two absorbed tea-drinkers took no notice of, when
suddenly, with a loud yell, a cat fell through the
open window and alighted abruptly on the man’s
neck, clawing and scratching at his back hair.
He was too much astonished to do anything but
jerk up his cup and deluge his face with scalding
tea, and then his impression was that somebody
had felled him from behind, and that gore was
streaming all over his face. It took fully fifteen
minutes to convince him that he wasn’t dead.
The record short engagement was gone through
by a Ballarat (Vic.) girl last week. She and her
lover “ had words ” as they wandered by the lake
shore. A passing stranger wandered vaguely into
the quarrel, advised the girl to “ chuck her bloke ”
and take on the new-comer as an escort home.
With touching confidence this advice was at once
acted upon, and the stranger was invited in, and
proceeded to make himself solid with Ma and the
rest of the family. Next day, with the aid of a
parson, six bottles of whisky and two friends, the
fascinating stranger married the trusting maid,
and one day later he bolted, taking with him the
bride’s marriage-certificate in a tin-box. A daily,
chronicling this headlong matrimony, guardedly
states that the girl “ gives ” her age as 25, and is
said “to be good-looking.” After reading thus
far the world will have concluded that the
girl was deceived by a designing villain. But no
—the bridegroom, said to be of excellent character,
has turned up again as good as new, his absence
having been merely due to the quality of the
whisky, and the pair are going to live happily for
ever after.
A first-night audience at Her Majesty’s on Satur-
day beheld the “ Silver King ” apparently played
on stilts. The cast is a typical cornstalk one ; and
all tower up close to and over the six-feet level.
Miss Eitzmaurice Gill, as Olive Skinner, creates
surprise by wandering round her villa at night in a
to-be-continued-in-our-next white drapery with
tree-foliage gummed on ; her purply evening-gown
is also florally ornate and pretty. Harrie Ireland
wore some cunningly-arranged fur on Nellie Den-
ver’s first-act gown, and little Daisy Ireland
shows that she shares the family inheritance of
sunsetty hair.
The water in the new swimming-baths at Cool-
gardie is mineral, and leaves “ a faint pink
deposit.” This must have an alluring effect on
bathers, making them look like freshly-powdered
babies. A thorough soaking in such water ought
to be recommended as a complexion-restorer, and
if it could only be patented in popular bathing-re-
sorts, enterprising property-holders would gladly
the multitudinous sea incarnadine—or words
to that effect—as an attraction to summer
swimmers.
Affable Emily Soldene is in Sydney once more,
and has given her opinion to interviewers that
“ Australians are far more go-ahead and advanced
in their way of thinking than the English.”
Emily has written a book which, she says, has
“ some rather advanced views in it.” If the book
were a treatise on mission work in China, the
authoress would probably have remarked on the
great and absorbing interest the people of this
continent feel in lightening the dark places of this
earth, or if she had written a poultry-keeper’s
manual, she would claim that the growing industry
here was chicken-farming.
The League of N.S.W. Wheelmen has been
agitating the subject of satin and wool as a racing
costume material. Wool, adopted for hygienic
reasons by the Yic. League, was voted out in
favor of the more gaudy satin “in cardinal colors
only.” When the suburban girl goes to “ barrack ”
for her favorite scorcher, she likes to see all the
part of him that isn’t out of his clothes sweltering
in shiny silk; wool is too dull and lustreless.
And the bare-legged hero clothes himself to
attract.
The loan collection of pictures which will
brighten the new additions to the Art Gallery in
April will give the public a glimpse of art treasures
carefully acquired at vast expense by local
millionaires on continental tours and hoarded in
the seclusion of newly-built, plaster-smelling
private galleries. The enthralled visitor is taken
round to visit best English-made landscapes of the
style where one man paints the trees and another
genius puts in the cows, or “ execute-while-you-
wait ” figure-scenes with the beginning-of-the-cen-
tury lovers in every possible attitude. Then there
are the “old masters.” But that is too sad a
subject with which to blight this letter. How
many Australian canvasses will be in the loan
exhibition ?
Theforthcomingcathedral fair —oneof theattrac-
tions of which is to be the inevitable tug-of-war—is
agitating the minds and the pockets of the faithful
in various suburbs. The Exhibition building was
taken one recent evening for a dance by a committee
of ladies whose names made the circular look like the
map of Ireland. At the Balmain Town Hall there,
was also a “ Myee ” dance, though the dancers
were mostly from the Emerald Isle. The “ Grand
Australian Fair ” will be held next Easter, and all
these preliminary outbreaks are to raise money to
furnish stalls.
Girls ambitious of securing an imported husband
sometimes have a deal of worry in regard o
exotic article. I heard of one damsel engaged to
a fair and faithless new-ebum who neglected to
turn up at the “betrothal dance arranged to
show him off, and now she doesn t exactly know
whether her engagement is on or off. A so,
another Sydney girl brought out her fiance along
with half Regent and Bond-streets in millinery
per mail steamer on her family s return Rom
foreign parts, and now the favored youth is
boarded and lodged at Pa’s expense and having a
good time generally while his adored one shows
him round to all her friends.
There was racing and chasing at the Lyceum
when the bailiffs arrived and wished to seize all
the wardrobes. One tall blonde actress was lucky
in getting all her gear away unharmed, but the
only course open to another was to wear away her
clothes on her back, a garment at a time, so. that
half-a-dozen visits to the theatre revealed her in
as many different characters, and her gaily-clad
appearance in the streets caused great surprise.
The pleased smirk of society wedding portraits
creates a craving in the breasts of some newly-
married folks to publish joyful pictures of them-
selves in all the illustrated papers, that a,n envious
public may gaze on them and yearn to distinguish
itself likewise. But some prefer to, hide their
rapturous expression from the world’s gaze. A
bridegroom of the other day who was thus pictured
along with his wife unbeknownst to either, waxed
more and more annoyed as he worked his way
through the weekly papers to see himself and her-
self smiling back at themselves in wholly un-
authorised photo, reproductions on the picture-
page. He is now consulting solicitors with a view
to unravelling the libel act and trying to bring it
in under the “ contempt or ridicule,” section.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
It is time to cast an eye of suspicion upon the
handicapping of bike-racers in Melbourne. Among 20
Australians who achieved places in their heats for the
A.N.A. Wheel Race, there were 10 who had taken part
in Austral finals one year or other, if not several years in
succession. W. J. C. Elliott, C. O. Tebbutt, T. O. Fisher,
and O. S. Prowse may be selected from the aforesaid
lucky 10 for handicap comparison. Tebbutt and Prowse
each won heats in the last Austral, and whereas Prowse
was put back 40yd. for his good performance on that
occasion, young Tebbutt was advanced 30yd.— i.e., he
met Prowse on 70yd. better terms in the A.N.A. event
than in the Austral. Also, for non-apparent reasons, the
veterans Elliott and Fisher got 20yd. longer start at Melb.
Exhibition than when they distinguished themselves
seven weeks previously on M.C.C. ground. The same
encouraging treatment was served out pretty evenly all
round, it is true, but, as a rule, the Austral starters
who didn’t run into places were not more favored this
time than the men who did, which explains why they
(the unplaced ones) got left again. And the occasional
exceptions are somewhat glaring. Prowse, as stated
above, had to go back 40yd. from his Austral mark, and
J. E. Clinton, who finished second to E. Perryman in an
Austral heat, was now put back 50yd., whilst E. P.
received the usual 20yd. extra, meeting his runner-up on
70yd. better terms. Clearly Tebbutt was absurdly
favored at the expense of such as Prowse and J. E.
Clinton.
W. O. Jackson’s case calls for special enquiry,
in The Bulletin’s opinion. Jackson won an Austral heat
with apparently a lot in hand, but his performance in the
final was not at all brilliant. Nevertheless, the handi-
capper for the A.N.A. race put Jackson back from 180yds.
to 70yds., and so he met Tebbutt at 140yds. disadvan-
tage as compared with their Austral starts. Jackson had
been recently disqualified for a term by the precious
L.V.W., but under protest the ban was removed in time
to enable the up-country candidate to start for the big
prize. Having earned a place in his heat, ill-fated
Jackson was disqualified once more at the instance of
G. Carpenter, who seems to be a recognised pet
of the Melb. bike authorities. This, then, is Jack-
son’s record as regards the A.N.A. Wheel Race. He
was the most unkindly handicapped competitor of the
whole crowd. He was disqualified from starting until
his few friends protested against the League’s action.
And when the League allowed him to compete, he was
knocked out of the final for “ erratic riding.” Query :
Would Tebbutt have been disqualified if he had happened
to bump somebody in his heat ?
The limit start in a two-mile wheel race should
be fixed at 300yds., even though this rule might necessi-
tate a placing of the “ cracks ” 20yds behind scratch.
Relfe, the wan Englishman, went slower than
M‘Donnell (40yds.) from the very start of his heat in the
A.N.A. race, and he had soon had enough of it. Porta
and Martin, as usual, were the struggling heroes of the
hour.
Two or three dangerous men were put out of the
A.N.A. Wheel Race by falls. Both Boidi and Grantor
ran like winners of their respective heats until the
asphalt smote them hip and thigh.
* * * *
Pither seems the most “ gone-off ” pedaller of
all the men who ranked among the first flight last year
whilst Porta, without doubt, is the most improved. But
the Italian’s appearance suggests that the time of his de-
generation draweth nigh. His face begins to show the
same peculiar pallor which marked Bilmartin’s iron phiz
when that persistent battler first comp.’ained of not feel-
ing well, and within two months, perhaps, Porta will need
to be assisted off his bike after putting in a great race
from scratch.
» • * *
The effort of running second for his heat in the
A.N.A. Handicap left Martin all agasp. A snap-shot
photo, of the over-wrought plugger, as he slowed down
when his task was done and the mob cried “ Good old
Bill ! ” would have been very well worth printing He
put back his head, opened his mouth, and gurgled
faintly, just as though Death had tapped him on the
shoulder.
The Bulletin herewith advises Martin to trv
the restorative effect of a trip back to ’Murka. He has
worked well and made a bit of money, and now the work
is telling on him—awfully.
Boidi is probably the coming bikist. Relfe
looks shockingly unhealthy, Lesna’s aspect is not pro-
nnsing, Bill Martin can’t spurt as he did, and our other
old friend. Porta, will not go on for ever. Boidi improves
steadily, ditto M'Donnell.
* * * »
Dear Bulletin, —Bike-race-reporting nuzzles
much. When bellow and Walne paced one another to
the fore in the Austral, over a grass track, the limit men
were blamed for not having gone faster. Now I read
that m the final heat of the A.N.A. race “the front
division made the pace pitilessly fast,” and yet the time
for the two miles (on asphalt) was a second slower than
the Austral record.—B.B.
* * • •
v T «t S, ! orting amateurishness of the League of
Vic. Wheelmen was shown in a ridiculous light at a recent
meeting of the League, when Sam. Winter proposed that
the Martin v. Lewis match should be “ hedged round
with conditions, so that if one man did not turn up the
other could not claim the race.” Observe how Winter’s
eate- money idea is calculated to ensure a genuine
struggle ! The man who seems very likely to get beaten
goes to the “ dead bird” and stipulates for a slice of the
prize money. Otherwise he will not turn up, and the
other fellow will get nothing.

When one Snell set out to lower the Adelaide-
Melboume bicycle record he was solemnly warned by his
doctor that he was probably lopping 15 years off his life.
He was similarly warned in Feb., ’94. He is now 28years
old—has therefore already lost 30 years. If this record-
breaking business goes on much longer, Snell will, in pro-
cess of time, be a toothless veteran aged 515.

Cycling has certainly the brutal characteristic
essential to a popular sport in a civilised, Christian com-
munity. On the Saturday previous to the A.N.A. event
in Melbourne, at the L.V.W. meeting, ambulance
stretchers were kept quite busy throughout the afternoon,
carting in the smashed-up riders, who came down in pairs
and bunches in every event. There were many dull,
sickening thuds on the Exhibition track on Foundation
Day ; and, the day after, the asphalt was found to be
richly illuminated with “ horrid swishes of blood.” The
Ballarat man, who was the first to come down, seemed to
have a good deal of his head and faoe ground off on the
raspy surface, and was, in addition, stripped of his riding-
pants, and left, unconscious and coverless, upon the
track under thousands of eyes, many of them feminine.
Five men got mixed up in a sanguinary hash in the
A.N.A. final, and two—Fontaine and Fisher—looked,
when gathered up, as if they had been run through a
steam reaper-and-binder. Wanted, a pneumatic india-
rubber suit for racing cyclists, on the principle of the
deep-sea diver’s dress.

A Brisbane correspondent writes that the ram-
pageous biker rules the road in that city, the police being
too warm to protest. A “ scorcher ” considers himself
aggrieved when he knocks against any unmounted mortal,
and a law compelling pedestrians to carry lamps back and
front (like poultices) after nightfall would fill a long-felt
want.
* * • »
The track at Melb. Exhibition Grounds is far
from perfect, for all the improvements. About half the
80,000 who attended the A.N.A. sports amused themselves
staring into the back hair of the other half, or catching a
fleeting glimpse of color once in 15 minutes. Experts
declared the riding path O.K. when it was opened, but it
has four death-traps in the corner curves, where the men
are bowled over in almost every event. The management
allowed for this fault on Foundation Day by providing
surgeons and ambulance-waggons, but no coffins. A stack
of coffins in the centre of the ground would have shown
that the authorities meant it when they announced
“ every provision will be made for the convenience of
competitors.”
• * * *
Young Tebbutt, who won the A.N.A. Wheel
Race, is a Rechabite and a Sunday-school teacher. Bil-
martin, by the way, is a teetotaller; also Porta. They
swill tea.

The females at bike-sports seem to have taken
up the study of anatomy. “ I can’t see the number,”
said one on A.N.A. day to her chum ; “ but I know it’s
him by his legs.”
* * * •
A week or two ago, when Bilmartin was accused
of cronk riding, he pleaded in indignant refutation that
he had backed himself for the event. It afterwards
turned out that by the League regulations birring by
competitors is forbidden, and that Bill had by his admis-
sion rendered himself liable to punishment. Beyond re-
marking the matter, however, the League of Yic. Weak-
men did nothing.
* • * *
The recent cricket-match, N.S.W. v. Yic., was
fairly fought out, and Yic. got beaten by close on 200 runs.
N.S.W. had the good luck to win the toss, but this was
more than balanced by Victoria’s double share of luck in
getting rid of so strong a batting side on a perfect wicket
for a miserable 159. Very likely the best English eleven
under similar conditions wouldn’t have got the same side
out for less than 275. Vic. therefore had every encourage-
ment at this stage, and still more when her team in the
first innings totalled 269 ; a lead of 110. This lead far more
than compensated for Vic. having to bat on the fourth
wicket should fine weather keep on, and the fine weather
did keep right along. The second innings of N.S.W.
brought out the full strength of the home team’s batting
in most consistent scores; Turner, with four, being the
only man not to get double figures. Donnan’s stubbornly
fine 84, without a chance, drove the first long nail into the
Vic. coffin, and after that Noble came with 153 not out.
Howell, the last man, came in to help Noble put on 110
for the last wicket; the innings ceased with the grand
score of 570. With 461 runs to face, Vic.’s chance was
dead and buried.

“ Jonah ” Jones is credited with the intention
to start cycle racing. He is now employed as a ground
man on Adelaide Oval at £3 a week ; the Sussex offer has
been finally declined. S.A. badly needs two more profes-
sional bowlers, as recent matches have proved. With the
decline of Giffen, S.A. depends entirely on lighting Jonah.

It would be a startling contract to under-
take to provide every man and woman with his or
her own dead body, but the Edison Electric Parlor
at 162 Pitt-street, Sydney, will go a long step
further and show everybody his or her skeleton on
a moment’s notice for the reasonable sum of 6d.
The X rays have been utilised by Edison for show
purposes, and hence the public gets an opportunity
to step into its grave long before its corpse has de-
cayed and to take a full and steady view of its
bones without any of the troublesome turning up
of soil necessary in inspecting a skeleton hitherto.
The X rays should facilitate cremation, because
when the public fully realises what a rattlesome
ramshackle gimcrack its own skeleton is, it will
want to go down to its tomb in the size and form
of a packet of salts.*

Benjamin Hoare, the Age leader-writer,
has developed into a fine lecturer, with a grand
air. The Argus is unfortunate in this regard. It
started Howard Willoughby off lecturing last
year, but Willoughby stutters and has a mincing
manner and a cracked-pot voice. A year or two
ago the Argus had a reporter named M‘Gregor—
now in England—who would insist on lecturing in
favor of Socialism.

He was a backblocks P.M., and wrote his

Story of Australia s most abusive
’X , tt„
mentary orator, a Sydney man. He was speaking
out-of-doors one evening when someone threw a
rotten egg which hit him on the mouth. Wiping
away thlhorror, he said: “ It stinks-but not like
the breath of the who threw it.”
Neither of the Sydney morning papers
ipelt Q. Attorney-General “Tommy” Byrnes’
name properly in its wired aocount of the Federal
Council proceedings. Both called him “ Mr.
Byrne,” and one alluded to him as Mr. S. J.
Byrne. Which is something for the inflated Mr.
Byrnes to chew over.
Sachse, Vic. M.L.C., had the thread of his
discourse badly tangled while orating at the
A.N.A. banquet. “This association,” he ob-
served, “ should direct itself to the collection of
Australian antiquities.” He paused to let the
scintillating idea soak into the assemblage when a
ribald youth at the end of the table blandly en-
quired, “ What’s wrong with the Upper House? ”
The remainder of Saehse’s speech was unheard.
Melb. : “Had a chat with Lormer, J.P.,
to-day. The little man persists in balancing him-
self against the vinous champions on the Licensing
Bench every Thursday. As usual
with the pertinacious, he is given
his own way. But it never pays to
lay to the public book. Lormer
has scuttled out of his cosy book-
shop in Bourke-st., and shrunk
to half the size in Little Collins-
street. Even the ‘ unco guid ’
refused to subscribe to his
paltry testimonial when they
heard he had addressed the
May Sunday meeting on
Yarra bank. The capitalist
is pious.”
“Oh, pa,” said a
little girl who had been
taken to the races for
the first time, “ why
have those men ” (point-
ing to the bookmakers)
“all got broken
noses ? ” “ Probably
because they de-
served them,’ re-
plied Pa, senten-
tiously. And how
did Mr. Butler-
Harwood, of Glen-
brook, get his
broken nose ? Did
it happen as some
intended victim
suddenly turned
round in the grave that was to be, and let out
with a straight left when he caught his “ mate ”
with his finger on the pistol-trigger ? However
Mr. Harwood came by that nose, you may depend
he deserved it.
M‘Gl. : “That Australasian portrait is
nothing like young Phillips, the Melb. murderer.
Instead of being a good-looking, plump, healthy
youth of apparently 15, the real Phillips is an
anaemic, under-sized, thin, hollow-chested, typical
cheap clerk, who might pass for 25. Who told
you he was Jewish ? There’s certainly no Hebrew
blood in him and nothing Hebrew in his appear-
ance, while, as far as religion is concerned, he was
a member of Dr. Bevan’s choir and taught a class
in the attached Sunday-school.
Joseph Chamberlain owns
station and other properties in
Maoriland, Australia, Bermuda,
and other far-apart countries. This
inspires his zollverein anxieties.
A very sad Australian young
person called Jerome Dyer, writes
a London correspondent, rose at a
recent meeting of the Colonial In-
stitute and delivered himself of a
harangue on “ Victoria and its
Resources.” Jerome’s facts were
as old as the convict hulk Success,
and his figures, when he had any,
were out of date and sadly erratic ;
also, he was pompous and weari-
some and despondent. If Victoria
has many resources like Dyer the
fact had better be concealed as
much as possible.
The Rev. J. Jones, who re-
tires from duty at Hunter’s Hill,
enjoys the unique distinction of
having on one occasion almost pre-
cipitated a war between England
and France. The French had
hunted Jones out of the Loyalty
Islands, where he had long been
gospeling, and the doughty parson
travelled to England for revenge.
He danced attendance assiduously
on Salisbury and worked up much
sultry indignation, but in the end
Salisbury declined to fight.
When Bryan O’Loghlen was
a burlesque Premier in Victoria,
his compatriots labored under a
grave injustice. At their St.
Patrick’s Day procession they
wouldn’t get their banner (a huge,
unwieldy structure on wheels)
under the telegraph-lines without
damaging the wires, or lowering
their banner and their dignity
also. The sympathising baronet
accordingly had all the wires in
t e city raised about 3ft., and
thereafter the gorgeous banner got
through without difficulty. “Thim
was great toimes for Oireland, en-
toirely. ”
Any rich and moderately vulgar Aus-
tralian who wants a title and is willing to pay for
it has now a golden opportunity. There is a
famine in India, and cash is being whipped up.
For a £50,000 donation a baronetcy could easily
be arranged.

Words of wisdom from Melb. Coroner

Creffield, king of Sweer’s Island, has abdi-
cated, and sold his little territory for ,£l5O. For
30 years Creffield has reigned, the absolute
monarch of Sweer’s Island, and now he retires

few royalties that the movements of any of them
are matters of absorbing interest.
Plain George Turner wore a very seedy
boxer hat, but could not live up to it. He has
become a K.C. M.G., and wears a belltopper now.
Once the man dominated the hat ; now, alas ! the

anxiously looking for the Australian statesman
who possesses the courage of his battered hat.
J. G. Drake, M.P., has had his engage-
ment to a Brisbane (Q.) girl mentioned in the local

What mystery to take !

Apropos Cardinal Moran, his alleged
Federal Convention candidature and clerical
opposition thereto, a very old Sydneyite laments
the “ good old days ” when parson Cowper, Father
Therry and Dr. Lang used to walk arm-in-arm
down George-street. The ancient does not remem-
ber if they were returning from the usual weekly
“ hangings.”
A correspondent writes to the Age in a
shocked hand complaining of the execrable taste
of Bourke-street shopkeepers who exhibit in their
windows portraits of the accused young man Phil-
lips. David Syme prints the letter, also portraits
of “the accused young man Phillips.” The
shocking taste of those shopkeepers lay in their
getting there first, presumably.
A member of a certain N.S.W. licensing
bench was re-appointed the other day, and, on
being congratulated in court, attempted a little
speech. He waved his fat palm towards the
magistrates, and said : “I am happy to be once
more aiding my collegians ” —meaning colleagues—
“and I promise to work as conscientiously in the
past as I have done in the future. ”
Young Sydney lawyer brings to a leader
of the bar his first brief, with which he has taken

could not see what had been missed. “ There is
no cheque pinned to it,” dryly said the Q.C.
N.S.W. Justice Simpson on Bench ; bar-
rister Moriarty appears to examine bankrupt as to
alleged extravagant expenditure. Moriarty:
“You, sir, say you were very depressed finan-
cially, and yet you bought a brdugham ? ” Simp-
son, J., interrupting : “ Excuse me, Mr. Moriarty,
in the society in which I move we pronounce that
word ‘broom,’ thus saving one syllable.” Later
on, His Honor takes the floor with the same wit-
ness : “Please explain to the Court, sir, why you
bought a ‘broom.’ Would not an omnibus have
taken you to your business as well ? ” Moriarty,
loq.: “ Excuse me, your Honor—but in the society
in which / move we pronounce that word ‘bus,’
thus saving two syllables.”
The other Monday, when Bums’ statue,
in Sturt-street, was formally presented to Ballarat
city, one or two braw Scots seized the opportunity
to “ blow ”in an anti-Hibernian direction. They
remarked that every member of the committee
connected with the Burns effigy, a dozen years
ago, was still alive and hearty, whereas the lead-
ing instigators of the Tom Moore statue, erected
several years later, have gone to their silent
tombs. The explanation of which invidious
distinction may be that Scotch whisky is the less
hurtful, or that those whom the gods love die
younger than Scawtchmen.
One of Zox’s latest yarns implicates his
bosom friend, Speight. The two out driving.
Heat 100 in the shade. “Have a drink?” Stop-
page at wayside pub. Two big bottles of soda
with brandy ordered. Speight tenders a half-
crown, and receives Is. 6d. change. Zox expresses
an opinion that the drinks are well worth a shilling
each. Landlady takes back a shilling. Speight,
with Yorkshire blood beginning to rise, says
something about Zox being very liberal
with other people’s money. Interval. More
drinks, this time at Zox’s invitation. Five
navvies enter, and are immediately asked to have
drinks by the genial Speight. “ Thanks, wot’ll
yer ’ave, Bill ? ” Bill thinks he’ll ’ave a long beer,
“ Not at all,” says Speight, “take the same as us,
it’s a great drink.” So all seven are served, and
Zox, with Jewish blood rising, pays over 7s. In
buggy, Speight with great glee : “ Got you there,
old boy—that’s more than shent per shent.’’
Ed. Bulletin, —Lately there appeared a
par. in the Red-Page criticising a new magazine
called Bradley, His Book, published in America,
and ascribing it to Bradley who illustrated Melb.
Punch a few years ago. “His work on Punch,”
you say, “was generally clever and piquant, and
there were some artistic regrets when by-and-by
he drifted away into oblivion.” You are all out
m this item, confounding two Bradleys, Will
Bradley and L. D. Bradley, the former famous as
an artist, with an American and European reputa-
tion —he is particularly noted for his clever poster-
work. The magazine reviewed is hit,. He never
saw Australia. L. D. Bradley is the man who
drew for Punch. The latter is also an American,
but he did not “drift into oblivion” by any
means : he returned to Chicago where, as illustra-
tor of the Inter-Ocean, he is looming conspicu-
ously. A recent N. Y. mrgazine article places him
first amongst American provincial cartoonists.
Strange to say, he never put pen to Bristol-board
with the idea of making a picture till some time
after his arrival in Australia, when he was over
30. His work on Punch was the result of very
little experience. He had a cartoon or two in
The Bulletin, by the way.—Edward Dyson.

The Chairman mentioned with" apparent pride
that the winner of the great A.N:A. Wheel
Race at the Exhibition on the previous day,
Mr. Tebbutt, was a Rechabite. (Hear, hear.),
Mr. Tebbutt was a well-known member of the 1

In connection with the forthcoming
baptism of Captain Chirnside’s son and
heir, and the “ housewarming” of the
Manor house, it was mentioned in last

receive special invitations. It seems, how-
ever, that it is the desire of Captain and
Mrs. Chirnside to welcome friends and
well wishers from all parts of the district
—even from distant parts like Little River.

POLITICAL
POINTS
N.S.W. civil servants will almost to a man
leave out the Ministerial candidates for the
Federal Convention.
Premier Turner’s Federal Council pro-
posals show his knighthood to have already given
him an Imperialistic tinge.
The appointment of “ Bob ” Philp as
Acting-Treasurer of Q. during Premier Nelson’s
absence at Hobart is read as indicating that when
Nelson resigns he will advise Lamington to “ send
for Philp.”
The Bulletin would ask the self-termed
N.S.W. “ Patriotic Party,” which now holds up
Barton to vilification tor having prosecuted the
Broken Hill strikers, what they did towards pre-
venting that action ?
There is some political significance in
the fact that Kanakaland has struck Anniver-
sary Day off its official list of holidays—
probably with a view to substituting the birthday
of the King of the Cannibal Islands.
S.A. Tories have allowed their organ, the
Country, to die just on the eve of important Leg.
Council elections. The pending contests will de-
cide whether the slender Fat majority in the
Council is retained. From a stomach point of
view, the Country was a good, reliable political
liar, but it became particularly dull from the time
a certain Supreme Court Judge was compelled to
cease contributing political articles to its columns.
NOT NEEDLESSLY PARTICULAR.
SWAGGIE (sticking “ swell” up for an old pair of trousers): “Well, boss,
if yor ain’t got none, p’r’aps the missus goes a-biking and can
spare me a pair that’s out of fashion, for I ain’t partic’lar.”
In his recent speech at Sydney, the native-
born Mr. L. F. Heydon, M.L.C., said: “Our
country (N.S.W.) is so large and rich as to offer a
very sufficient object for our loyalty.” Now, N.S.
Wales is in area about one-ninth of Australia.
Mr. Heydon, therefore, is loyal to one-ninth of
his fatherland.
The Q.N. Bank Relief Act passed Q. Par-
liament only on Premier Nelson’s distinct pledge
that the smothered enquiry into the bank’s posi-
tion would be proceeded with. It is now an-
nounced that the enquiry has been further
smothered pending the bank’s arrangement with its
creditors. The Labor-members who belied their
past and their policy by trusting Boodlewraith are
vainly filling the air with reproaches.
The latest from New Australia. That
happy Socialistic community possessed two wells
■ —one of clear, sparkling water, the other running
through a clayey bank. Dictator Casey, believing
the latter supply better for the health of the com-
munity, removed the rope thither from the first
well. Hence grievous discord, revolution, and ap-
pointment of a new Despot.
Several Federal politicians tried to get
election proclamations into the Sydney dailies in
the guise of “letters to the editor.” But the busi-
ness managers had foreseen this, and the editors
were on guard. It was pathetic to read in Sydney
D.T. the other day, for instance, than an epistle
had been received from Mr. O’Blank, arguing
that so-and-so, etcetera, but the letter was “ too
long for publication.”
Dear old ex-Republican Dibbs says scorn-
fully that to build a new Federal capital would
cost .£250,000 a year, which, at 4 per cent., means
that the total cost would be £6,250,000. Con-
sidering that the Federal Government would get
the land either gratis or at prairie value, the
splashy Dibbs seemingly proposes that the State
should build a city to hold 30,000 people—build it
all, private houses included—and then let the
whole place rent free.
Rockhampton is still the leading port of
Bananaland in the matter of exports. The total
exports, however, show a falling off of .£250,000 —
decrease confined to the meat-trade. Centralia’s
wool export has increased by three million lb. in
weight, or £61,000 in cash. Gold shows also an
increase of 2000 oz. Query : If Gladstone were
connected with the Central line, would a couple of
wheelbarrows suffice to trundle Rockhampton’s
exports down to the Fitzroy ?
Agent-General and ex-Governor Norman
assures the bulls and bears of London that the new
Queensland loan is not for the purpose of propping
up the dreadful Q. N. Bank, but is to be expended
on “authorised public works.” But then any
kind of public works is “authorised” if the
Government majority chooses to authorise it, and
anything is a public work if Parliament says it is.
“ Authorised public works ” is a good, sonorous
phrase, but it means anything or everything or all
sorts of things.
Dear Bulletin, —
Do titles wreck Austra-
lian politicians, after
all ? Parkes was Pre-
mier twice before he got
his title and three times
afterwards, and his title
didn’t blast him, any-
how. Robertson was as
fortunate a politician
after he got his title as
before, barring that he
was older and poorer,
two things for which
his K.C.M.G.-ship was
in no way responsible.
Dibbs fell from office
after he took a title,
but he also fell twice
before he took it, and
he ruled longer as
Dibbs, K.C.M.G., than
as plain Dibbs. Plain
M‘llwraith was once
Premier of Queensland:
MTI wraith, K.C.M.G.,
was Premier twice.
Plain Samuel Griffith
was Premier for
years : Samuel Griffith,
K.C.M.G., was at the
head of affairs for 2f
years. Berry certainly
vanished out of politics
when he got his title,
but he didn’t vanish
more completely than
the democrat, Higin-
botham. Patterson with
a title didn’t crumble
any worse than Shiels
without one. Vogel had
a title almost all through
his meteoric career ; he
was Premier two years
as Vogel, C.M.G., and
virtual Premier three
years as Vogel,
K.C.M.G. ; when he
was plain Vogel he was
never more than a sub-
ordinate. Stout,
K.C.M.G, was Pre-
mier for three years;
plain Stout was never
more than an underling
in the very weak and
incapable Grey Cabinet.
Baronet O’Loghlen never came to the front at all
till he got his title. Which way does the balance
of evidence lie ? Certainly every titled politician
must fall some time; also every other politician.
—Z.
Maoriland now reckons that its surplus at
the end of the financial year will be close on
.£300,000. If so, the necessity for floating a one-
million loan and thus going back into the mire of
Vogelism isn’t very apparent. A country with
<£300,000 surplus should be able to crowd through
without borrowing.
The cry of the Sydney importer about the
league that will be formed in the Commonwealth
Parliament by S.A. and Victoria against N.S.W.
can only pass muster with the densely ignorant.
It implies that Vic. and S.A. have a common
interest—which they haven't, and never had.
S.A. demands a considerable strip of Victorian
territory on the ground of an error in the original
survey. When the border tariffs are abolished,
S.A. ports will be the natural outlet for about
one-fifth of Victoria, and a lot of business will
leave Melb. for Adelaide. The idea of Vic. and
S.A., with these two corpses between them, being
natural allies against anybody, is wildly ridiculous.
The N.S.W. Freetrade —smile here !
Government surreptitiously protects the cement
industry by accepting a local tender for 70,000
casks at 6d. a cask more than the importers price.
Therefore, the oppressed taxpayer pays £1750 to
support an exotic industry, and “ trade is diverted
from its legitimate channels,” and all the other
horrors of Protection arise on the scene.
THE ONLY CHILD—AGAIN.
(Room full of company.)
PROUD MA (leading in little Johnny, to proud father) : “ My dear, this hoy has been fighting
again. ”
PROUD FATHER: “ Pooh, pooh, my dear —I like to see my son able to take his own part.
What were you fighting about, Reginald? ”
REGINALD : “ Well, dad, Tommy Smith said he could whop me just as easy as mum whops
you, and I showed him he couldn’t .”
(That night someone whopped Johnny. It wasn’t his ma.)
W. P. Crick is probably the most remark-
able N.S.W. Federal candidate up to date. He
reports that he will be “no party to any act that
will abrogate or minimise the powers of the people
or Parliament of N.S.W.” If the Parliament of
N.S.W. is not going to give up any of its powers,
even to the Federal Legislature, then the latter
can’t have any powers at all, and, if it has no
powers, then it can only exist for the purpose of
playing dominoes and having free-passes and
drinks. Crick says he is also dead against “ Fede-
ration without conditions.” Who ever spoke or
dreamt of Federation without conditions? The
natural conditions are that every Australian shall
have, as far as possible, an equal share in the
Government, and in the making of laws ; shall live
under the same taxation system, and shall have
the same show as every other Australian.
Dr. Quick, of Bendigo (Vic. ), one of the
most conspicuous advocates of Federation, pub-
lishes his Federal election address on page 2 of
this issue. It is a good address in some points,
yet it isn’t nearly so good as The Bulletin
expected from such a source. Dr. Quick proposes
to federate part of the public debts only, which is
a weak half-measure. He says nothing about
depriving the provincial authorities of the borrow-
ing powers which they have so shamelessly mis-
used in the past, and of which they should have
no honest need in the future. He proposes that
the Commonwealth should have a “limited and
defined control over railways for Federal pur-
poses,” which sounds very differently from the ab-
solute Federalcontrol so urgently needed. He holds
that the States should retain all their powers except
those expressly transferred to the Federal authority
providing that the Federal authority
should hold all powers except those expressly re-
served to the States—which is quite another
thing. Also, he proposes that the provinces should
. federate indissolubly under the Crown ’’—which
is capable of two meanings. The Bulletin
believes that the provinces should federate indis-
solubly from choice, and under the Crown as a
temporary yielding to necessity. If Dr. Quick
means the same thing, this paper concurs. But if
he means that the Federation should be indis-
solubly connected with Britain, The Bulletin
isnt having any. In any case, he should say
exactly what he does mean, unless language is
?’ ven t° a Federal candidate to conceal his
thoughts.
As soon as N.S.W. Parliament meets some
member should move for a return of all moneys
paid by Government to M’sL.C. and M sL.A. in
the form of expenses on commissions and select
committees since Reid came into power. The
Select Committee on Abattoirs is only one, and
not the worst, example of the tipping of political
friends out of the public Treasury.
South Australia, on whose consent that of
Westralia is contingent, will withdraw her objec-
tion to the institution of Imperial penny-postage,
and so Henniker Heaton (who has the written
consent of Queensland and N.S. Wales) will soon
have his way. The rate from Australia to England
will, however, stand at 2£d. as at present.
The S.M. Herald’s latest anti-Federal
correspondent writes to point out that N.S.W.
should avoid all union with S.A. as it would a
serpent, because of that province’s “ selfishly
grasping ” management of the Broken Hill trade.
The selfish graspingness lies in the fact that S.A.
happened to have a railway which suited the con-
venience of the Broken Hill people, and as N.S.W.
refuses to build one of its own, the Hill has to use
the S.A. line or else shut up altogether. The S.A
railway management alone keeps N.S. W.’s biggest
mining-field from being abandoned, and L. F.
Heydon and others solemnly curse her for coming
to the rescue. This is a grateful world.
L. F. Heydon, M.L.C., announces as an
evidence of the deep awfulness of Federation that
one-third of N.S.W. is nearer to Melbourne
than to Sydney ; one-fourth is nearer to Adelaide
than Sydney, and one-fifth is nearer Brisbane than
Sydney. When these things are added up they
mean that one-half of N.S.W. is nearer to othei
ports than to Sydney. The fact that some of the
places alluded to are quite near Newcastle,
Grafton, &c., and that N.S.W. has lots of ports
besides Sydney, doesn’t enter into Heydon’s philo-
tl? o Heydon kind of man Sydney is
N.S.W. and the rest of N.S.W. is nothing in par-
ticular. Taking Heydon at his word, however,
\u E Proposes as an amendment that the
other half of N.S.W. is also nearer Brisbane than
Sydney, and that Sydney is nearer to Melbourne
than it is to itself, and that unless some arrange-
ment is made whereby Sydney will be as near to
Adelaide as Adelaide is to Sydney the latter city
will be Lost. 3


A delicious cooling drink. The juice of
the lime fruit, as prepared in Rose’s Lime Juice
Cordial, supplies a beverage particularly whole-
some and refreshing in water —effervescing in all
mineral waters and an excellent stimulant
blended with spirits. It possesses valuable medi-
cinal properties, cooling and purifying the blood,
stimulating and assisting digestion. It is entirely
free of spirits. Recommended by the Lancet.
Sold everywhere. Purchasers should be careful
to order only Rose’s Cordial, all others being
imitations.*

Confidence in the Firm you are dealing
with is a more desirable qualification
than reliance on your own limited know-
ledge of the relative value and merits of
musical instruments. To become expert
in Pianos one requires many years of
close application and constant associa-
tion. Our established reputation is a
guarantee that misrepresentation is never
resorted to in order to effect a sale, and
we cordially invite the public to call on
us and look through our magnificent
stock of instruments by all the best
makers, which we offer at least twenty
per cent, less than any other house in
Sydney. If you send your order by post
you will receive just as good value (per-
haps better) than if you came with two
or three experts to select the instrument;
because it is our interest to send the very
best we can afford for the money. The
best advertisement we get is the recom-
mendation of our customers. We fre-
quently receive letters with statements
like the following:—“We are very
pleased with the Piano you sent; it is
very much better than we expected.”

Up till last Friday, 31 Convention candi-
dates were announced in N.S.W.—eight lawyers,
one doctor, three merchants, three journalists, one
compositor, two miners, two “agents,” three
“gentlemen,” two secretaries, one plasterer, one
storekeeper, two mechanics, one carpenter, one
tailor. Victoria had 27 candidates—nine lawyers,
two civil engineers, one mining manager, one mer-
chant, one brewer, five “ gentlemen,” one doctor,
two booksellers, one bootmaker, one house-agent,
one mining-speculator, one compositor, and one
agent. Victoria is ahead both in lawyers and
“gentlemen.” The lawyers include some of the
best men of the province—Turner and Isaacs, for
instance —but the “ gentlemen ” are mostly to be
viewed with suspicion.

The up-country gelding Tom (Invader—Marian),
who won Anniversary Handicap at Rand wick after per-
forming ingloriously the previous Saturday, was origin-
ally bought for 17gs., but proving an inveterate buck-
jumper was put into a sulky, where he soon quieted
down; he afterwards became a regular up-country cham-
pion. On the advice of a leading N.S.W. jockey he was
brought to Sydney. Besides winning stakes and bets his
party sold him to Mr. Kelso for 300 gs.

If racing is to be kept at all clean stewards
should investigate each and every case of sudden reversal
of form; and if occasion demands it they should have
the power to impound a horse and run him against the
winner at same weights. Many impostures would thus
be shown up, and terror struck into the camp of the
“waiting” division.

Harvey, the owner of Bloodshot, dreams of
taking down Newhaven in a w.f.a. event at V.R.CJ.
Autumn Meeting. He will start the big-little horse (D.V.)
for the Australian Cup, Champion Stakes and Essendon
Stakes, and if the mighty Derby-winner tries to run away
with the latter event Bloodshot will endeavor to hang on
to his hind wheel.

Survivor (Loohiel-Melissa) in carrying 9.5 to
victory in Flying Handicap at S.T.C. meeting, has proved
himself one of the best sprinters in N.S.W. With 7.12 he
had previously hunted Precaution home in Carrington
Stakes, and next day won New Year’s Gift, carrying 8.5.
He incurs no penalty for Newmarket, in which he carries
8.12, and should therefore go near winning.
* » » »
N.S. Wales’ San Marco (Niagara—Veronese)
has been sent to Vic., where he should pick up a few good
races, even if he does not star in the Newmarket. He is
very speedy, and well able to carry 8.2, which is his impost
in the big six furlong race.

Ed. Bulletin, — Some little time ago I drew a
so-called favorite in one of Tattersall’s sweeps. Acting on
a hint, I offered to bet the owner £5OO to nothing about
his horse. Answer : “ Keep your £5OO for charitable pur-
poses.” Then I offered £l5OO to nothing, and got back
word that the horse would run. The horse ran, but was
not in the race—because I had not offered enough ? Mr.
Adams has the name for being a straight goer; can he
not stop the continual bleeding of his patrons by jockeys
and horse-owners ? —Sportsman.
* * * *
N.S.W. Income-tax Department has already
sent notices to winners of Tattersall’s sweeps during ’95
intimating that the tax must be paid on the amount they
received. This will come hard on the individual who is
the figurehead for a big syndicate, as, if his co-winners
will not pay, he will have to part up for the lot; but pos-
sibly the proportion paid the horse-owner will be allowed
off.
* • * •
Much of Sep. Miller’s apparent bad luck on the
turf is the natural result of a bad racing policy. The
wealthy chairman of the V.R.O. seems rather inclined to
have a large number of poorly-bred horses running on the
flat than a few really useful ones, and no straight-going
owner can expect to reap much satisfaction from a stable-
ful of platers. In the hurdle and steeple branch of sport
he shows more enterprise, and appears to get a better re-
turn for his money.

The Heavens do not smile on the efforts of the

The coming together of Messrs. Eales and
Gorrick in the pigeon-match last week—when Gorrick
won was worthy of a couple of America’s best
newspaper fighters. In a sporting paper published
the week previous to the match, Mr. Gorrick allegedly
said “ it struck him forcibly that Mr. Eales was not too
anxious to meet him ; ” whilst Mr. Eales allegedly replied
that “ he very much doubted whether Mr. Gorrick would
come up to the niark.” The bruisers have hitherto held
a monopoly of this sort of talk.

In Melbourne last week, Charles Cavill stayed
under water smin. ssec., setting other cranks a world’s
record to try and beat. A swimmer of Cavill’s calibre
should not need any such monkey tricks to boom the art
of which he is such an able exponent.
* * * *
The recent Inter provincial sailing-races in Port
Jackson may be looked upon as an unqualified success—
barring, perhaps, the win of Flying Fish in the 22ft.
race on the last day. The F.F. is composed of two half
boats with a platform between, and the unfairness of
bringing half-decked, comfortable crafts from other pro-
vinces to find they are pitted against a catamaran or
sailing-machine is obvious. All the same, the sailing
capacity of the aforesaid Flying Fish is an eye-opener.
Golding’s two last creations —Vigilant (22ft.) and
Thalia (18ft.) —were probably the most consistent per-
formers at the meeting, although it must be said the races
showed as much reversal of form as a trotting or pony
meeting. Thalia, by running into places every event
showed herself to be an all-weather boat; and Vigilant
had the bad luck, on Anniversary Day, to spring her mast
when holding a comfortable lead, and, as her skipper was
afraid to jibe her, for fear of putting the stick over the
side, the Queensland Bulletin had the luck to score the
only win the province made during the series.
On the first day the Irex fairly sailed away with
the 22ft. race, but she did nothing afterwards. The sur-
f>rise of the meeting was the failure of Joe Donnelly’s
atest 22-footer, the Effie. After three consecutive wins
immediately after launching, her poor showing in the
carnival is not to be explained unless Mr. M'Murtrie made
some alteration in her trim or gear. A case in point was
the old yacht Alec a score of years ago. When launched
she proved a flyer, but Mr. Tom Brown altered her trim,
and he could never strike it again, for from that day till
she was converted into a steam tug she never won a race.
Fig-tree, 22ft., built by Stevens, is a likely cus-
tomer, but a blow is where she ought to show her best.
The pair built Dy young Deering, Wonga, 22ft., and Stella,
18ft., had terrible luck all through. Veteran George Ellis,
who ought to know, reckons the Stella about the best 18-
footer he ever sat in.
Frederick Lane, the 220yds. amateur swimming
champion of N.S.W., is a student at Sydney Grammar
School—a typical old boy. His acquisition of the title is
one of those streaks of fortune which are often mistaken
by the unthinking as a criterion of the man. Young-
Lane is a fine swimmer, and there is no getting over the
fact that he beat Hellings, Gormly and Cavill, but these
cracks were all stale through incessant training and
tough struggles with each other in previous contests this
season. Lane’s time was put down at 2min. 46sec., which
is 7sec. worse than the world’s record, but as he only just
beat the other men, and as these swam slowly, the time
must be accepted with portion of one eye closed. There
is plenty of promise in Lane, however, but he will have to
down the always-fighting three when they haven’t been
fighting each other to death before he can rank as a
champion. No branch of athletics continually followed
will make a man so stale as swimming does.

The Federation Convention Election.
TO THE ELECTORS OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
Gentlemen,— Pursuant to previous announcement, I
intend offering myself as a candidate for your suffrages
at the forthcoming Federation Convention Election.
The scheme of Federation which I approve is one that
will give to the Federal Parliament the right to legislate
upon all subjects in which the people of Australia have a
common interest; and which will leave to the individual
States sovereign powers to deal with all matters not ex-
pressly delegated to the Federal Legislature.
The Federal Parliament, in addition to controlling Cus-
toms and Excise, and dealing with all matters appertain-
ing to defence, post and telegraphs, &c., should, I think,
control—virtually and actually—the railway policy of
Australia. There are at present two impediments to free-
dom of trade over the continent. Intercolonial Customs
barriers constitute one. The other is a railway policy
which compels people in the outlying districts of" a large
State to trade with the capital of their own State by ex-
pressly denying to them railway communication with a
point on the seaboard a hundred, perhaps two hundred,
miles nearer to them—merely because that point happens
to be the Capital of another State.
It is conceded on every hand that under Federation the
border tariffs must go. To abolish a border tariff to per-
mit freedom of trade between the colonies, and to main-
tain a railway policy that prevents it, is merely to mock
at the basic principle of commercial union, and to convert
Federation from a reality into a miserable make-believe.
If the individual States have absolutely sovereign rights
in respect of all matters except those expressly delegated
to the Federal Parliament, it seems to me that federal
legislation should represent the will of a majority of the
people of the Federation, and not a majority of mere
green and red and yellow divisions painted on a map.
The principle of majority will be seriously endangered if
the Upper House of the Federal Legislature, possessing
an absolute power of veto, is composed, as the Common-
wealth Bill proposes, of an equal number of senators from
each State, irrespective of population. Under such a
system, a majority of people might, for an indefinite
period, be kept at bay by a minority. And the strength
of this minority would arise from the extraordinarily in-
consequential fact that their residence-places were scat-
tered over a larger number of map-divisions than were
those of the majority.
At least one of the official leaders of the Federal move-
ment has intimated that unless the principle of equal re-
presentation in the senate be conceded, there can be no
federation. He accordingly proposes to concede it • but
at the same time, suggests an expedient that makes the
concession utterly worthless in practice. If it be regarded
as advantaging anyone to make a formal concession to the
principle of “ State rights,” I am perfectly willing to make
it—on condition that the constitution provides some means
whereby the will of the majority of people, as expressed
hy their representatives, may ultimately, and without un-
due delay, prevail. In other words, I am prepared to give
a “ majority of States ” the shadow of supreme authority
so long as a majority of the people of united Australia re-
tains the substance.
Election of the Senators by the people, as against their
selection by the State Legislatures, I am, of course in
favor of. ’
The site of the Federal Capital—a question which has
little material interest for the great mass of toiling men
and women, but apparently much for the higher ranks of
society—I would leave to the Federal Parliament for
determination.
My views on the various principal points of the federa-
tion problem are enunciated more fully than above in the
P. ap ? rs of 25th Jan ' Briefl .V outlined, my position
is that I desire to see set up a Constitution which will
enable the people of Australia to act unitedly in all mat-
ters of large national concern; which will prevent the
Government of one State pirating the commerce that
naturally belongs to another State, and which will
enable the States—as, for instance, in such a
matter as debt-consolidation—to secure by co-ODera
tion advantages which, singly, they could not obtain
for themselves The ideas which I have expressed here
and elsewhere I believe to make in that direction • and I
have been moved to restate them by an utter want
of sympathy with the spirit of narrow localism which
is now being fostered in Sydney by men who are appar
ently quite ready to smother a nation at its birth in order
that, as they suppose, the interests of some pet puny
weakling of their own may not be prejudiced. * B

Is This a Miracle?
AN M.P’s VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT.
WHAT MR. LABOR-LEADER M‘GOWEN
KNOWS.
From the Australian Workman.
Mr. J. S. T. M'Gowen, leader of the Labor-
party in the N.S.W. Assembly, was seen by our
reporter in connection with the remarkable case of
Mr. .Thomas Jarvis which was given some weeks
ago in this paper and which is given below. Mr.
M'Gowen says he has known Jarvis from infancy.
He also knew that he had to give up his work at
Glebe Island abattoirs twelve months ago, owing
to a malady which he developed. He afterwards
heard that Jarvis was bedridden, and that there
was little chance of his recovery. He understood
Jarvis was refused admission to the Sydney Hos-
pital, as his case had been pronounced incurable.
Mr. M‘Gowen was, therefore, like everyone else
who knew the facts, astounded at the complete re-
covery of Jarvis.
THOMAS JARVIS INTERVIEWED.
On Thursday afternoon, our representative
made his way to the humble home of Mr. Thomas
Jarvis, 45 Crown-lane, Ultimo. He was discovered
nursing a two year-old baby, and his face declared
him to be the happiest man in Sydney. He was
up and about and able to answer the knock at the
or ‘ . pale and bearing still the marks
of a critical illness, and a period of pain, it was
very clear that he was an invalid on the rapid road
to convalescence.
(t reply to the preliminary questions, he said :
You want to know all about my case ? Well, I
am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts
may be of value to those who are stricken as I
was.”
“ How long were you suffering?”
‘‘Well, twelve months ago I got so bad that I
had to leave off work and I have done nothing
since then. About five years ago, next Christmas,
I met with an accident; I was badly scalded
while taking a bath in Pitt-street, Sydney. Since
the accident I have been in failing health, and
after four years of gradual development of the
malady, I was forced to give up my billet at the
Glebe Island.”
“ What were the symptoms ? ”
“ Simply indescribable. The pains were some-
thing terrible. They were just about as much as
I could bear. They were for all the world like as
if a saw were cutting my bones in two in every
part of me. I had no control over my bowels or
bladder, and was a nuisance to myself and every-
body else. I was incessantly shivering and shak-
ing, and could neither eat nor sleep. On the 23rd
March last I saw a well-known doctor and he told
me that my case was utterly hopeless. However,
he gave me an order to the Director of Charitable
Institutions.”
“ Did you make use of the order ? ”
“No ; I came home and went to bed, and have
been pretty well in bed ever since. Five weeks
ago I could not walk across the floor; in fact, I
could not get out of bed. I felt then that it was
all over with me, and only a question of days when
I would give up the ghost. My doctor was at-
tending me, and did all he could, by opium and
morphia pills, to ease the agony I was in. I was
under him for five or six weeks. He came to the
conclusion that I was suffering from locomotor
ataxia, or progressive locomotor ataxy, a disease
of the spinal cord, characterised by peculiar dis-
turbances of gait, and difficulty in co-ordinating
voluntary movements. He told me that I might
last for ten years, and that I might never get the
use of my legs. (Just then the patient kicked his
legs about with energy to show that medical
opinion is not infallible.) Well, just as a drown-
ing man will grasp at a straw, I grasped at an
idea conveyed by the advertisement describing the
cure effected in the case of another boiler-maker
in England, which I read in the Australian
Workman, by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People. I read in the advertisement of a case
which seemed to fit my own. I determined to
give the Pink Pills a trial anyway, and sent for a
box.. The effect was as marvellous as it was
magical. I was able to eat and sleep as though
nothing was the matter with me. It was the first
appetite and rest I had for many a day. It
was incredible. I immediately left the bed and
was able to move about. I have taken four boxes
of Pink Pills during the past four weeks, and am
now taking the fifth box. I can walk about with
the aid of a stick, and am gradually, but surely re-
covering my former vigor and vitality. You see
those crutches there? They are perfectly new,
and I have never used them. They were made
for me before I got the Pink Pills, but I was too
weak to use them and now I don’t want them.
All I want is this stick, and I hope soon to do
without it. You see I am rapidly regaining my
strength.”
“ He is 100 per cent, better,” said Mrs. Jarvis,
who had come in and taken the baby on her knees.
“The Pink Pills have saved his life and made
another man of him.”
A friend who called in at this point, said that
Jarvis looked 10 years younger that day than he
did a fortnight previously.
“lean now,” continued Jarvis, “have a cold
bath, and all the feeling has come back in my legs.
If I keep on going the way I am, I hope to be able
to resume work as a boiler-maker, and you know I
have to be in the very pink of health and strength
to work at that trade. lam better to-day than I
have been at any time during the past five years.
I ascribe all the change and benefit to these Pink
Pills. They have saved my life. lamin no pain
now, whatever, and feel like a new man. On the
mantelpiece there is a box of opium and morphia
pills which the doctor gave me to deaden the ex-
cruciating pam. But they can stay where they
are, for Ino longer need them. Everybody who
knows me has been amazed at the change in me.
They can hardly believe their eyes. My being
about again has caused quite a sensation out here. ’


TERRIBLE CASE OF
ECZEMA
CURED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. E. Wyatt, of Port Road, West
Hindmarsh, So. Australia, writes of
the sad condition of her little daugh-
ter, whose portrait she also sends:
“My daughter was afflicted witli
Eczema of the most aggravated
type. The disease first appeared in
eruptions on her head, then her hair
began to fall out, and in spite of
the best medical advice and treat-
ment she grew steadily worse. The
sores were full of matter and were
extremely offensive. Her eyes be-
came affected, and she was, in truth,
in a terrible state. My neighbors
were very sympathetic and took
great interest in the case. They
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, and I am most thankful to
be able to say that this wonderful
medicine completely restored my
daughter’s health. She has now as
good a head of hair as anyone could
wish, her eyes are perfectly well,
and she is a fine girl of eight years
with every prospect of growing up
to be a strong and healthy woman.

Broken Hill varied its awful monotony of
sunstroke and red dust by a gruesome New Year
sensation. A resident returned to his wooden
residence when the holidays were over, and feeling
his way in the dark became vaguely aware of
something dead. He lighted the lamp, and then
the sensation of something dead became so over-
whelming that he left hurriedly and went to have
tea with a friend. Later on he returned with a
reinforcement and investigation revealed a de-
ceased citizen under the floor in a condition about
which the less said the better. At the inquest i
doctor reported that deceased had a rare and won
derful complaint which would ultimately tend tc
drive him mad with a peculiar form of madness, in
which the patient always wanted to shove himself
lengthwise into a hole and die there. Several
witnesses reported having met an unusual sort of
maniac who drank immense quantities of water,
and yapped at them in a peculiar fashion. Anothei
man reported having captured the unusual maniac
and taken him to the hospital, but he was refused
admission, there being no demand for curios just
then. Consequently he was turned loose and went
away to yap some more and drink more water.
Verdict: death from natural causes. There are
so many strange ways of dying in the land of dust
and grey smoke and lead-fumes that they take
sensations peacefully there.

A correspondent condemns the new Sydney
letter-boxes. Not only are they too small, but,
becoming congested on holiday periods (or by
Sunday nights) they are liable to periodical rob-
bery, and special facilities are afforded for the
larrikin game known as “ shouting the post-office
pipe a smoke.” In the old pillars the chances
were that an inserted match would extinguish
itself in its downward course. It is further sug-
gested that Sydney letter-carriers should be fur-
nished with straps in lieu of twine for securing
their packages.
While Triple Alliance confronts Dual
Alliance, and Britain shivers in her splendid
isolation, and the U.S. is being lashed up to fight
Spain for Cuba, the mammoth intellect of the

lash out at Bismarck and Schouvaloff, silences the
clamours of a shrieking universe with a leader on

Jules Joubert has got his little Interna-

three months ago. The then “ directors ” dis-
pensed with his services. Joubert, in his very
best broken English—he always adopts broken

strokes —said (in effect): “You dees-sharje, ah,
me? No! I, ah, dees-sharje, ah, you! Zis ees
not your exheebeeshiong ! Eet ees of, ah, me !'
Then he rounded up another set of directors, anc
worried the Government to grant him a subsidy
“I, ah, want five zousand pounds i ” The
Government jibbed, but it franked his official
letters, and permitted him to use the “ Royal
arms” on his stationery. “ I vhill get zat five
zousand pounds ! ” said Joubert; “ eet vill come
all right.” Later, the Govt, applied for space fox
exhibits. “ Zere ees no space to spare. You
want an annexe? Ver’ good. Ze price of ze
annex is five zousand pounds.” And the betting
is that Government “ won’t subsidise the exhibi
tion, oh, dear no ! It will merely pay for space.’
Also, since the Government has put its imprima-
tur upon the exhibition, and made it a sort of
State affair, it is pledged in a manner to ensure its
success. Joubert is a smart man.

- - - MIRACULOUS CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfahne Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in.every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and No.‘2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W. A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “ Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ! Ihe
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.
HERR RASSMUSSEN’S
Testimonials.

A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
. 160 Elizabeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
course of your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, I consider you are deserving of
succtss, which I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
ful >y. A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus: To Herr Rassmussen. —Dear
Sir, —I think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R, A. LUCKHAM.

Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform you that

Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. HUTTON

Mr. Butt.in writes later:—"The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies. 1 ' 1

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medioines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l

REFERRING TO
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press:—
Sydney Bulletin.— “ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known

Herr Rasmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist of
Sydney."
The Australian Workman, Sydney.—“ Having
seen and examined letters from all parts of the world, we
are assured that Herr Rassmussbn’s Alfaline Remedies
have saved a world of suffering, and his remedies have
cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Nord Australischc Zeitui g, Brisbane.-" We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-
amined letters from all parts of the world, we are satisfied
that he is deserving of universal thanks.”
Australian Star, Sydney.— “ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become

who have the best opportunity to watch his career.

Some years ago, in the Northern Territory,
a Chinaman raked in about 60oz. alluvial and
started back for Port Darwin. On the road,
somewhere between Rum jungle and Tumbling
Waters, he fell sick and lay down beside the
track. Other Chinese going along the track
passed over on the other side, like, the Levite.
(Chinamen nearly always forsake a sick country-
man—on the road, anyway.) By-and-by he died,
and by-and-by some teamsters along the road
threw some dry sticks on him and applied a match,
and so he was beautifully cremated. Not long
afterwards it leaked out that he had had about
60oz. of gold on him, and two white miners down
on their luck started from the Howley diggings,
found the remains, and panned them off for 30oz.
So, at least, a cheerful liar tells The Bulletin,
and maybe this time he hasn’t lied quite so much
as usual.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
The circumstance that Q. authorities had
to send up North a commissioner to enquire into
Meston’s charges re ill-treatment of blacks, recalls
the fact that one of the most amazed men south of
the line appeared some time ago in a Q. police
court, and asked faintly what had happened. It
was up on the north-eastern coast, where the
nigger is still plentiful; and the parties to the
transaction were a squatter and a most hopelessly
bashed and bruised aboriginal. The white man
explained the situation affably. He had lost a
bullock, or something, and after scouring the
country in a dozen different directions he had
failed to find the animal, but had discovered a son
of the soil instead, sitting under a tree. When he
demanded the instant return of the vanished pro-
perty, the native had started to run, which was a
suspicious circumstance and almost positive evi-
dence of guilt. Therefore he had captured him, and
having tied him to a tree had flogged him in a most
profuse and lavish fashion in order to elicit infor-
mation, and, as no information was forthcoming,
he had fastened his hands and feet together, and
carted him into town on a charge of cattle-stealing.
If the bench would kindly send him to gaol right
off he would be obliged, as he wanted to get back.
Then the bench smiled a smile, and said it would
send him to gaol instantly. TheP.M. was admin-
istering justice by himself that day—the batch of
squatting J.’sP. who usually jugged each other s
niggers without asking any questions being all
absent; and he seemed out of sorts, for, as he
uttered this last remark, he made a strange crunch-
ing sound with his teeth, but the plaintiff set
this down to absent-mindedness. Then he started
to write something in a book, and, when he had
finished, laughed again and repeated in an un-
accountable sort of way that he would send him to
gaol without the slightest delay. The sentence
would be three months’ hard labor for assault.
Here the plaintiff rose and thanked the court
cordially, and remarked that though, the charge
was cattle-stealing it really made no difference, as
a sentence for assault would answer exactly the
same purpose ; but the Bench smiled its smile. over
again, and said gently that it was the plaintiff
himself who had got three months for a fiendish
attack on a defenceless nigger, combined with
illegal arrest, and an attempt to corrupt a court of
justice. Then, while the plaintiff glared at
vacancy a policeman collared him and dragged
him away. The last thing he saw as he left the
court was the P.M. still smiling, and then he sud-
denly doubled up at the knees, and asked the con-
stable if they were both mad, or if they were dead
and had arrived unexpectedly in hell; and when
he got no answer, but was simply shoved into a
whitewashed cell and left there, he. sat down
heavily on the floor, and moaned that it was evi-
dently all a dream.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chests
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. _ lb
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.” .... ~
«• My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly _ cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tam worth, N.S.W.” .
*' We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne ! s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

The more it is interpreted by the Devil’s Bri-
gade the more does Vic. Licensing Act become a dark and
fearsome mystery. The other day a Melb. publican was
hauled up on two charges of Sunday trading, the alleged
offences occurring on the same day. A conviction meant
pretty well wiping out the licensee, but his lawyer pointed
ont that, according to his reading of the Act, only one
fine could be imposed—the offender could only be con-
victed once for trading on the one Sabbath, no matter
how many times a breach might occur during said 24
hours. The defence was allowed, but the prosecutor has
given notice of appeal, on which momentous issues
depend.

Salting is not quite unknown on Coolgardie. A
lease —adjoining a good one—on which was once a rich
alluvial deposit, was lately inspected with a view to pur-
chase, and a couple of bags of the formation taken as a
sample. These were sealed and left at the hotel where the
expert was staying, and, while he was absent for a short
time the bags were got at: a marlin-spike was inserted into
the side of the bag and a clean hole made, into which was
blown through a “ paper screw ” enough alluvial gold to
spoil the attempt. The bags were then worked about
and the contens mixed up, the hole closed itself. When
the contents were panned off the yield was such as to con-
firm the expert’s suspicions, with the result that he never
went near the mine again. But the salters know that the
expert knows, and are lying low.

A recent large robbery of genuine securities
from a Melb. merchant’s office fetches to mind an odd
affair in Collins-street at the boom zenith. Some burglars
raked round in Mr. Boomster’s office, and the leading
journal said next morning how lucky they missed a
million pounds—in securities.

Every mining spec, the mammoth composition
man has touched during the last 12 months has turned
up trumps, and he is now better off than ever. Another
“penny-in-pounder” has acquired marketable shares
(coal mainly) worth many thousands, whilst Melbourne
Stock Exchange would be almost without investors, were
insolvents “ comparrangementers,” and “settlement on
wifers ” debarred from speculating on it.

A North Queensland bankrupt, the amount of
whose liabilities requires five figures to express, and the
expected pan-out of which is 9d. in the £, had in the
fly leaf of his cash-book, the Scriptural legend— Diligent
in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord ihe
ledger fly-leaf showed—“ Seek ye first the kingdom of
heaven, and all those things shall be added unto you.

Q Premier Nelson has authority to treat with
theQ.N. Bank on behalf of Queensland in connection
with the proposed “agreement” under the hurriedly-
passed Act; but the rumor, recently strongly current in
Brisbane, that it will be necessary for Nelson to go to
England on Q.N. Bank business may be contradicted with
safety. The British shareholders have arranged to send
out to Queensland two or more London accountants of
the highest standing, and those experts are to investigate
the bank’s affairs thoroughly. The life, or death, or
reconversion of the institution will depend upon this
report. . , , .
In connection with many of the central sugar-
mills established in Queensland, there are small farms of
40 to 100 acres that have been sold on terms to intending
cane-growers, whose names are placed on the co. s list.
The hoodwinked country naturally wants to keep these
small men “ living,” but doesn’t know that these cane-
growing farms are mortgaged to the big man, and that
the “sale” price-or “ terms ’’-covers land mortgage,
interest, and a fat profit besides. In this way the central-
mill svstefn is helping otherwise bankrupt institutions to
unload on to poor men unliquid properties at a boom
price with ruinous conditions attached.

The Adelaide telegraph-operator scandals a,re
not surprising. When Govt, pays married men (with
families) £lOO a-year, after years of service, it must expect
leakages. “ A man must live.” Years ago, a similar leak-
age occurred, and the sympathy of the public was with
the dismissed men, who simply supplemented their starva-
tion salaries by standing-in with outside brokers and
specking on “ exclusive information.”
* » « *
A leading Adelaide sharebroker affirms that,
under a pledge of secrecy, a telegraph official, who could
have done what he said, offered, for a consideration, to
supply him with copies of all share telegrams from W.A.
two hours before they were delivered. Another broker
added that in Coolgardie the telegraph officials know the
codes used by every member of the exchanges in that
place.

A Westralian magnate was asked to furnish a
report by a suitable man, and instructed one of his mine-
managers to make the report, and to charge (say) 100
guineas. When the fee was paid over, the magnate calmly
appropriated half of it for himself as his share. Fact.

Keenly alive to the exaltedness of their posi-
tions, the mining engineers connected with the big com-
panies on the Boulder line (writes a scoffer to Thf. Bulle-
tin from Hannan’s) are about to have a railway-carriage
fitted up in sumptuous style for their own exclusive use.
In no part of the world is this sort of thing carried much
further than here. In a recent speech a prominent Aus-
tralian bishop described the leading Australian character-
istic as a want of reverence and awe. His reverence has
evidently never been in Westralia and witnessed the
homage paid to the uncrowned lode-kings—mostly ex-
jam-boilers, tailors and barbers, &c. It is only natural
that they should want a railway-carriage to themselves,
so that when travelling they may have that respect paid
to them which is their due ; but as when they leave the
carriage people, unaware of their rank and majesty,
may offer undue familiarities, it would be well for them to
wear tin hats and be accompanied by Jap. servants in
livery.

“ Talking about notes, and being reminded of
the recently-exposed stamp-obliteration frauds in Mel-
bourne : When bank-notes become too dirty and tattered,
they are cancelled as they are received into the bank
again, and stand away until a pile has accumulated, when
they are destroyed 'in the bank-furnace. A Southern
bank-official once managed to get away with an old-man
bundle of cancelled notes. Like the Melbourne stamp-
artist, he treated them with chemicals, until he found an
ao-ent that obliterated the cancellation. Then he
managed to have then) distributed far and wide over the
country. Some time elapsed before any of them came
back to head-quarters ; a still longer time passed before
they attracted attention. There was a hubbub, and
much pow-wowing, but they never got enough evidence
for a prosecution.”
Three heaviest holders of Melb. Herald scrip
are Vic. M.L.C. Simon Fraser, M.L.A. Macdonald Paterson

list and with no opposition should easily keep its perch.

Hint of strong competition has given the Vic-
torian explosive ring the shivers. The crowd has nad a
fine picking for some time, and opposition would be a
welcome relief and gain to the industry. As many co s
spend from £1500 to £2000 a year in explosives, a small
droop in prices would mean an appreciable saving.

“ The rapid extension of ‘ incandescent-gaslight-
ing' ” writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
“ necessitates a large and continual supply of thurium,
earth-metal discovered by Berzelius in thurite. The cone
curtain of the incandescent gas-jet is soaked in a solu-
tion of thurium, which renders it comparatively incom-
bustible and is responsible for the snow-white bright
li„ht emitted. At present the thurium supplies come
from the seashore sands of Brazil, but there is n
reason why Australasia should not contest this market
monopoly. Thurium has been found in small quantities
in the beds of Tasmanian gullies or creeks by searchers
for precious stones, but no serious attempt has been
made to procure regular supplies of a payaffie quantity.
Thurium is not likely to fall in value, so the attention of
the miner and prospector might be aroused in its quest.

In the inner circles of Brisbane (Q,) steamship-
ownerism (copyright) there was lately a whisper
that a cable had been received from the ditto ditto of
England that the latter could guarantee to shl P
tificated engineers to Australia within six weeks fioi
receiving instructions so to do.
It is suspected in Q. labor circles that the steam-
ship-owners are playing a waiting game, and that every
move has one chief object-to gain time while sounding
resources of England in respect of non-union en-
gineers. Much depends on the result of the attitude of
isolation adopted by the Adelaide Steamship 00.

In at least one Melb. bank, clerks receiving ,£96
a year have often to work from 9 a.m. to 11 p.in., often
also on Saturdays and Sundays. Juniors receiving 1:30
must do the sanie, without tea-money and without com-
pensation of any kind—not time-off.”
London Referee adds its rough-and-ready argu-
ment to the stock of “Bimetallism” literature. “An
ounce of silver now fetches only half the price relatively
to gold that it did formerly, and it is ever getting cheaper.
The silverites demand that it shall be restored to its old
position in regard to gold, but that is beyond the power
of Bryant, or any other potentate on earth, for if every-
body could buy silver bars at half-a-crown an ounce, and
have them coined into money representing five shillings
an ounce, of course nobody would dream of paying his
debts in gold. The idea of the bimetallists that dear gold
would continue interchangeable with cheap silver is one of
the most amazing delusions that the world has ever
known.”

Why did Sir Henry Norman refuse the
Indian Viceroyship ? When on his journey from
Herberton to Cairns he stopped at a wayside
house about eight miles from Mareeba. At the
d<oor was an old follow who saluted the Governor
in approved military style. “To what regiment
did you belong?” “To the same as yourself
when you were plain Captain Norman in 1854,„
said the old fellow, cheerfully. “Your name?
“ John Jonathan Cole, your Excellency, and Sir
Henry remembered him, with great astonishment,
and shook hands fervently with his old war worn
friend of the 2nd Company Scotch 1 usileer
Guards. During their subsequent conversation,
Cole asked Sir Henry why he did not accept the
Viceroyship. And the usual sharp-eared, inquis-
itive person overheard Sir Henry reply, “ Not
from Gladstone, Cole ! ”
* * * *
Two Ms.L.A. mentioned in Cole’s hearing
that they had dined with Sir Henry “ I dined
with • him long before you fellows had left ott
knickerbockers,” observed the old warrior. One
morning, in the Crimea in ’54, Captain Norman,
when walking round the camp, found Cole roast-
ing a slice of bacon on the end of a ramrod.
“ That smells good, Cole! 5 4 * Better stop and
have some, Captain Norman. 55 And the future
General and Governor sat down and had a rasher
of bacon, a biscuit and a cup of coffee. As a
soldier he seems to have been at all times a great
favorite with his men, just as he was with all
classes of Queensland.

Cardwell is a town on the shores of Rock-
ingham Bay. It is about the size of that Spanish
town where two women and a goose made a market.
The only break in the monotony of existence is a
cyclone that comes along, carries away one-halt
of the buildings, and fills the remainder up with
sand. A well-known local celebrity, one of the
oldest inhabitants, informed me confidentially :
“ I done pretty well here, though I nearly lost
everything in two o’ them dam saloons !

Also, an unsophisticated old squatter from
the Upper Herbert had been on a visit to the
Johnstone River and saw a schooner full of 1 oly-
nesians, a race to which he has a strong objection,
tie remarked to me : “ This country will simply
go to blazes if the people allows whole shiploads
of them blasted ‘ politicians ’ to come here like
that ! Better let sugar slide ! ”

When old Father M £ Nab was missionary
among the blacks at Durundur, he was one day

in Queensland was against the late Theophilus

ing article on the Upper House, Bring was At-

himself had written the article may partly account
for the Courier being acquitted without a stain

Lady Norman was one day talking to a
representative Brisbane society woman who knows
nothing about law or lawyers, and not very much
about anything else. Reference was made to a
famous case then on at the Supreme Court. R

At a picnic-party on Fraser’s Island a
young man who parted his hair in the middle was
present with a camera on tripod stand. (The day

The original inhabitants were represented by one
old blackfellow with a spear. The A.P. decided
to give a wild bush aspect to the scene by telling
the o.b. to poise his spear “ all same kill black-
fellow ” when he gave the signal. The old chap
misunderstood the order, and, when it came, his
eye flashed with an ancient war-fire and he let go
the spear at the camera, the operator and the
instrument narrowly escaping impalement, lne
camera man wanted to have the Myall warrior
shot dead on the spot, but the picnickers smiled
until no one had strength enough to kill a sparrow.

THE SONG OF “OUR STAPLE PRODUCT.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the clipper fleet comes over,
When the scent is on the clover,
And the scarlet streaks the blue ;
When the Western sheds are ringing
And the Western men are singing
As the toiling teams come through,
Then it’s ho, ho —Wool, ho !
For the busy shears are clipping, and a stir is in
the shipping,
And it’s yo, ho—Wool, ho !
When the boys have got together,
In the warm October weather,
When the tempest of their laughter
Shakes the hut from floor to rafter,
And the bush is turning brown ;
When the lover gets his maiden,
When the Southern teams are laden,
And the clip is rplling down,
Then it’s ho, ho —Wool, ho !
For the trucks are at the siding and the railway
men are chiding,
And ’tis go, go—Wool, ho !
Get that steamer to her berth there !
Get the men of all the earth there !
Have those lorries in their places !
Have the breeching to the traces ;
Get your wool-hooks fixed to heave.
Get your truck-wheels good and greasy;
Let the lower shoot run easy.
Have the guy-rope through the sheave !
Hey ! ho, the Wool, ho !
Hitch your belt until she pinches : is there steam
up on the winches ?
Go, go—Wool, ho !
Have the store-men got their muster
Ere the boss begins to bluster,
When the winch-men start reversing,
And the stevedore starts cursing,
And the wharf “ stands by ” below?
For she’s bound to sail by Monday—
“ Wool aboard ” at midnight, Sunday—
Wool, ho ! Wool, ho !
Oh ! the hungry looms are calling and the markets
may be falling—
Wool, ho ! Wool, ho!
Are ye ready ? Are ye ready ?
Heave aboard now ! Steady, steady !
Let them stand below the slings there,
Let them catch it as it swings there,
And their trust be in the Lord ;
For her skipper’s making trouble,
And the crowds are working double,
And it fairly hums aboard !
Does the Wool, ho ! the Wool, ho !
You ! the agent’s clerk is growling, and the for-
ward hatch is howling,
For their Wool, the Wool, ho !
You can ring the bell for dinner :
We have shoved her cargo in her,
And the Blazer mustn’t beat her
Though he’s flying his Blue Peter—
Hark ! you hear the hissing steam.
Now, she’s straining at her tether;
Now, they’re swinging out together
With their noses to the stream,
And the Wool! the Wool, ho !
Yes ! we cursed her and we damned her, but we’ve
rammed her and we’ve crammed her,
With the Wool! the Wool, ho !
Oh, we slung it and we slammed it,
And we squeezed it home and jammed it
For the glory of the Trade —
For her agent and her skipper,
And the comfort of the clipper
And the Broker-man’s Brigade.
Oh, ho, the Wool, ho ! the Wool, ho !
It will fill their pockets full, ho ;
It will buy their fowl and truffles and their ladies’
lace and ruffles,
Will the gritty, greasy Wool, ho !
Will the dirty, dunnaged Wool, ho !
With ten thousand bales of plunder,
And a cable’s length asunder ;
With a shouting and a cheering,
With the harbor pilot steering,
They are flopping down the bay.
She’s a ripper ! she’s a racer !
But the Blazer’s got to pace her,
And he’ll do it—all the way !
With the Wool! ho, the Wool, ho !
With his engineers and stokers and his able-bodied
And the Wool! the Wool! Wool, ho J
While her grinding engine’s grieving,
In the rolling and the heaving ;
While the sogging seas are swirling
With the white-capped surges curling
She will thunder on her way :
With her piston rods a-thumping,
While her heavy bows are jumping
Like a porpoise at liis play.
And the Wool, ho ! oh, the Wool, ho !
She will rise and buckle to it, she will chew a
roadway through it,
For the Wool! for the Wool! Wool, ho !
As her blocks aloft are creaking,
As her steam-escape is shrieking,
In the rising and the falling
Hear the bo’s’n’s whistle calling
When she strips to face the gale !
With the long green track before her,
With the storm-clouds black’ning o’er her
In the waning starlight pale. •
But the Wool, ho ! oh, the Wool, ho !
When she’s rolling and she’s lifting there will be
no cargo shifting—
For ’tis Wool, ho ! London brokers’ Wool, ho !
With an albatross to guide her,
While the dolphins race beside her,
When the restless screw is churning
And the blue a-wake is turning—
As she surges on—to cream ;
As the smoke shoots from her funnel,
As the shaft rings thro’ the tunnel,
As the sea-birds wheel and scream ;
With her Wool, ho ! the Wool, ho !'
She will romp and roll and toss it; fetch her
cargo safe across it—
For ’tis Wool, ho ! the Wool, ho !
When the vintage time is nearing,
When the corn ripes in the clearing,
When its scent has left the clover,
When the summer days are over,
And the South wind heads to rain ;
With a rolling swing to larboard,
With a swinging roll to starboard,
She’ll be clamping down again
For the Wool, ho !
With her goaded engines grieving thro’ the pitch-
ing and the heaving,
For the Wool, ho !
When the bees have stored their honey,
When the boys have spent their money
Ere the shears have started clipping,
Ere the stir is in the shipping,
She’ll be romping down the track ;
With the long green road before her,
With the bright stars beaming o’er her,
Rolling, rolling, rolling back
For the Wool, ho ! the Wool, ho !
Crowding ev’ry stitch she’s got on for the wool
that buys our cotton —
For the yellow, greasy Wool, ho !
The Wool, ho !
Ho, ho ! The blessed holy Wool, ho !

“You had better go,” she said. “My husband
will be in soon, you know, and he still believes in
you.”
“And in you?” The sneer in the man’s tone
sent the color to her cheeks.
“ Yes—in me, too, and he shall have the reason
for it in future which may have been wanting in
the past.”
“ May have been ? You are singularly guile-
less ! ”
She made no answer, but met his gaze. He
shrugged his shoulders and went on :
“Remember, I have been your cavalier at every
social function ; you have allowed me three, four,
on one occasion six, dances ; and—really there is
rarely smoke without fire. I have sent you flowers,
I have your photographs, many notes —sweet
little things some of them. Gossip spreads ; why,
at the club only yesterday— ”
“ What did they dare say there ? ”
“ Oh, nothing definite, just the vague things
that make rumor.”
She laughed, leant back in her chair, looked
him full in the face, and laughed again. “ Oh, I
understand you so well now, my dear friend, and
how I loathe myself that I ever believed in you !
I thought you were a man, you see, and you are
only a poor contemptible wisp of a thing. ”
“ Don’t say nasty things, Rose—you are play-
ing a losing game. You are playing pluckily, but
don’t be rash.”
She laughed again. “ How could I have thought
you a man ! I see you and all your paltry creep-
ing nature as clearly as ever woman could see
such things. How well I know how this rumor,
of which you speak, has originated, here a little,
there a little, to gratify your pride, and enhance
your reputation.”
‘ ‘ Reputation INBo you, for an instant, realise
how reckless you are when you talk of reputation ?
Do you remember that yours is at my mercy ? ”
“As is also that of every other woman of your
acquaintance. I realise this, that it is sad for any
of my sex to know you—sadder still if they happen
to attract you. But remember this : that I am
quite prepared to take the consequences of any act
of mine, and that, having been indiscreet, I will
have to suffer. The fault is my own. I do not
even blame you ; you are what you are, and some
instinct should have warned me of you. You
threaten me with scandal if I refuse the honor of
your further acquaintance : I certainly prefer the
scandal.”
“ It will be difficult not to believe scandal
against so charming a creature as you.”
She rose and went towards the door. “ I think
my wisest plan will be to tell my husband every-
thing, making a point of the fact that any gossip
or scandal that arises originated from you in
revenge for my refusing to let you make love to
me.”
He smiled. “You may be right; one or two
thing’s will be awkward to explain to a husband
possibly. ”
She flushed. “ Not to mine, for he is a man,
and were it a thousand times more difficult I
would prefer to do it; therefore, don’t you think
you’d better go before he comes in.”
“I daresay you are right: you so often are.
Adieu, sweet one! You’ve played your hand
well.”

From Johannesburg to The Bulletin:—
What strikes one most forcibly on his arrival here is
the cosmopolitan character of the population. In the
streets or on the railway-station, one can hear and see
people from all parts of Europe, and a good many parts
of Asia. The Indian hawker is much in evidence, but the
Chinese not very frequent. In this connection it may be
surprising to you, as it was to me, to know that at a
census taken a short time ago there proved to be more
Australians in Johannesburg than Americans ; most of
the men belonging to the building trades are Australians.
I stopped a few days in Capetown and saw Bob Hudson,
of Sydney, there, superintending the erection of a cold
storage warehouse, said to be the largest in Africa. I
have had several trips into the country, and have slept
at a Boer’s house, and I must say that I think that the
“Uitlander” shows more hatred to the Boer than the
latter shows to the “Uitlander.” They are very jealous
about their language, though—as can be seen by the
street-signs. The names of the streets are on almost
ever}- street-corner, and were originally painted Street,
but the “eet” has been painted out in all cases, leaving
St., which can be interpreted as standing for Straat or
Street, whichever the reader wishes.
The involutions of libel-law were lately
brought home to the O’Malley, M.P. (S.A.),
recently. He made a speech in Parliament on
the barmaid question just before prorogation, in
which he verbally scarified all his opponents. The
comments on this effort pleased him so much, that
he arranged for the Chronicle, a weekly paper
circulating largely among his constituents, to
reprint the oration. After the stereo, plates were
cast, however, his solicitors advised him that by
paying for the matter as an advt. he lost the
protection thrown over him by Parliament, and
brought himself within the provisions of the libel-
law, and so he had to rush to the newspaper office
and pay a good sum as compensation for taking
the plates off the machine, re-making up the
paper and casting new plates. His utterance
caused such a sensation that the youngest member
of the Assembly, who has still some feelings of
decency left, sought to have it expunged from
Hansard, but the old stagers laughed this sug-
gestion out of practical politics. -


HOW TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN
W<sre Rescued from Disease, and Restored to Heeltn
and Happiness by Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

I
ru
Throughout the world Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is noted as a blood purifier
and a tonic and invigorator. Testimonials to its worth are to be numbered
by the thousands, and come from all the four quarters of the globe. One
of the latest is from Miss Mary Maguire, a well-known Philadelphia
business woman, who has two nephews, both aged five years, Elliott
Maguire and Walter Kester. Out of gratitude for the cure of their
diseases by Ayer’s Sarsaparilla she sends us their portraits, which we
reproduce above, and writes :
“I can safely say that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla has saved those children much agony and
perhaps their lives. Since they were born, not one dollar in doctor’s fees lias been spent upon
them, and the only medicine they have taken has been the Sarsaparilla. They first began on
it two years and a half ago. They hadn’t been strong, but were never exactly sick till then.
It was early in the spring and both children, who are cousins of almost the same age, fell ill
at the same time. Elliott’s trouble was chiefly in his stomach at first. He had violent indi-
gestion, and at such an early age that was something alarming. Then eczema made its
appearance. These unhealthy conditions were largely hereditary. The little boy’s skin
began to blotch up and eruptions made their appearance. With Walter it was different. His
arms and the upper part of his legs were badly swollen and the veins seemed to stand out like
purple cords. He also had stomach trouble, which was inherited, and it is pretty hard to get
medicine to cure inherited diseases. However, I had seen Ayer’s Sarsaparilla advertised to
cure such cases and I got a bottle of it and gave it to both boys. The first bottle produced
a really remarkable change. It was wonderful. Then I began a regular Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
treatment. I gave the medicine to them three times a day. The blood troubles disappeared
and their skin cleared up splendidly. Then their stomachs got into condition again. Since
that time I have given it to them regularly every spring. They have got so used to taking it in
that season that when I miss a dose they say: ‘ Auntie, you forgot our Ayer’s.’ They have
never had any other medicine whatever, and that alone has cured them and made them weU,
strong and hardy. I consider the Sarsaparilla a wonderful medicine.”
