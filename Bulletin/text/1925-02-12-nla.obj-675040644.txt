Life’s Rebel
My Life Story, by Arthur Lynch (John
Long), brings me face to face with a lad
perhaps my junior by a year or two, who
was a boarder at the rival “college.
Born in the little Victorian gold-rush
town named Smythesdaje, that now lives
on the less attractive metal of the plough-
share, Arthur Lynch was one of a large
family, “as,” he remarks in this autobio-
graphy, “was usual in those early Austra-
lian days when families of 10 or 15, or
even 20, were not remarkable.” Be
was in due course sent to Grenville Colleg
in Ballarat to complete his education; h
was then, as I remember him, a sligh
rather delicate-looking lad, but a goo;
athlete and a devoted admirer of Fran £
Hewitt, a then famous runner, who wa
exalted to the rank of a demi-god in ou
boyish fancy. When little more than 1
he went on to the University of Melbourn
where a brother, Peter, was studying med-
cine. Throughout this story, filled wit i
vivid accounts of happenings, some inter
woven in the history of national event
Lynch is frank in criticism. An idealisi;
himself, he expects much from his fellow
beings. Professor McCoy, of the Melbourn
University of his day, he thus describes a
“one of those stalwarts of the last generatio
who had refused to accept Darwin’s theories
and so, it might be said, achieved his grean
reputation by perverting the minds of
generation.” Of another, Professor Kernot
“ ‘How did the Colosseum strike you?’ sai
I. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘it’s a big thing, but ver
disappointing. They didn’t know how t
bond stones in those days, and there’s a lo
of scamped contractors’ work in it.’ ”
Leaving Melbourne an M.A. and a quail
fied civil engineer, he made his way to Ger
many and the University of Berlin. Ther
he attended lectures in physics and physio
logy, the former by Helmholtz, “one of th
greatest intellects of all time.” Bismarck
was at the height of his power. What thi
candid young Australian saw was a man
“whose whole set, appearance and style wa
less that of a diplomat than of a sergeant-
major.” His description of the Kaiser i
even less flattering: “He looked to me on
of the worst types of the officer class, wit i
their petty insolence and the rude manner
inculcated by the spirit of caste.” Having
gone to Germany expecting to find there
fountain of philosophy and a culture un
known to other nations, he speedily cam
to the conclusion that its fame had been
over-rated. In one direction only he re
spected the Germanic intellect, and that wa
in “the greatness, the brilliancy as well a
the solidity of its work in science.”
Finding his means would not take him
to the end of his projected course in Berlin
he went to London. He carried with him
a book on which he had based inordinately
high hopes: “Approaches; the Poor Schol
ar’s Quest of a Mecca.” Such a title wa
ill-calculated to attract publishers, but i
nearly succeeded in landing one. With the
bad luck that seemed to wait upon Lynch
the optimistic publisher died. The MS. was
submitted to his successor, who handed it to
the reader for the house, a then popular
lady novelist, who in her report cheerfully
remarked that “the writer would assuredly
finish either in jail or a madhouse.” Short
of money, a stranger in Fleet-street, poor
Lynch was “up against it.” He tried to
earn a crust as a free-lance journalist, turn
ing first to the more technical prints such
as dealt with engineering and scientific sub
jects. The chapters describing this perioc
are full of vivid interest, and give thumb-
nail sketches of many quaint characters.
Then it was he first saw something of Par-
liamentary life and its leaders. With true
Australian directness of diction he sums
them up. He fully sympathises with Glad-
stone’s grandson (afterwards killed in the
war), who declared plaintively: “‘l’ve been
trying to read grandpa’s speeches, and they
give me a headache.’ ” After all the mighty
noise “the grand old man” produced “little
remains of permanent value as an adden-
dum to human thought.” Harcourt, with
“his beefy, unattractive countenance,” had
a style that was “the model of mediocrity.”
In Joe Chamberlain, with his “perky
look and clever, smug expression,” he could
find nothing to remind him of Pericles. He
saw Parnell, and his admiration for the
Irish leader carried this son of united Irish
and Scotch parentage into the swirl of
politics.
Entrance into this field opened up an-
other phase in the life of the many-sided
man. At the next general election, avoid-
ing the party machine, he made a direct
appeal to a Galway constituency. Lynch
had never been in Galway before, but by
a rousing speech he reached the Galway
heart, and only lost election by 50 votes.
Paris next saw the wanderer. There he
met, among others, Zola, then preparing
the groundwork for “La Debacle.” “I
asked him what were his ideas on the next
war. ‘None at all,” he said, ‘ —except
for one thing. And that is that the next
war will be extremely short. Ten days,
perhaps, or a fortnight.’ ” So much for
prophetic vision! Returning to London an-
other spell at journalism followed. “At
one time I had to subsist a fortnight on two
shillings. That was not so difficult as it
appears, especially to me with my early
Spartan upbringing. My nourishment con-
sisted almost entirely of oatcakes and milk.”
He might have cabled to his father for
money, might have borrowed it from
friends, but it was characteristic of this
proudly independent man that he was “re-
solved to fight it out myself and win.”
Truly the gods—if none other—loved Lynch,
for he battled as a strong man against
adversity.
Events crowded on one another: a visit to
America; a commission as war correspondent
to Ashanti; Lisbon, Madrid, Constantinople;
Paris once more. And then the great event
in his life-—South Africa and the Boer War.
Always on the losing side, and always with
the under-dog; a big heart, often an aching
ana sometimes a bitter one, but always a
heart that beat in fiery indignation against
oppression, real or imagined! He received
the commission of colonel with the Boer
forces, and recruited and organised an Irish
brigade. He met Kruger, Botha, Smuts and
all the leading men in the Boer command.
Of the campaign he gives an arresting
account —its divided counsels, its rude
organisation, the initial success, ultimate
defeat and final capitulation. Then he made
his way to the United States, where he met,
and made a friend of, Theodore Roosevelt,
a friendship which served him well later
on. He returned to Paris, and whilst there
his Galway friends put him up for a vacant
constituency, and he was duly elected. To
return to British soil subjected him to the
risk of arrest on warrant for treason, for
no specific term had been inserted in the
Peace Treaty absolving British combatants
on the "Boer side from such prosecution,
though it was alleged a promise to that
effect had been given. Lynch made the ven-
ture and paid the penalty. He was arrested,
tried and condemned to death, the sentence
being commuted to imprisonment, and later
he was released —there is little doubt King
Edward personally intervened. Character-
istically he spent his leisure in prison read-
ing such ponderous I'iterature as Hamilton’s
“Quaternions” —“not an unhappy time,”
ho remarks. On leaving prison he was
practically stranded, for though released ho
had lost all civic rights. Eventually these
rights were restored to him, and he took his
seat in the House of Commons as the repre-
sentative of the faithful men of Galway.
Meanwhile his fancy turned to medicine, and
he qualified to practise that profession too.
In 1914 he faced the issue of the war—
and gave himself with enthusiasm to the
cause of the Allies, once again on what at
the moment seemed to be the side of the
under-dog. He was given a commission as
colonel to recruit a loyal Irish Brigade, but
“the spirit that prevailed in Dublin Castle
and in London was fatal to success.” Since
the close of the war, having during its
progress lost his seat in Parliament, the
kaleidoscopic creature has devoted himself
to scientific and literary work.
The old home town with its glamor of
the past has sent many fine strivers into the
world, but none more picturesque, more ver-
satile, nor more idealistic—idealistic to the
point of phantasy—than Arthur Lynch, Don
Quixote of the Goldfields.
T. B. C.
Galsworthy and Some Frenchmen
ln her monograph on Galsworthy Sheila
Ivaye Smith says of him that he “has few,
if any, English affinities.” He has, however,
very marked artistic and spiritual affinities
in France ; a fact which goes to prove that
the literature of satire is not limited by fron-
tiers or language, and that art is not neces-
sarily determined by the milieu or by the
race. Galsworthy is English by birth and
education —English of the English—yet in
many respects his talents and the mode of
his thoughts are Gallic. ' His novels do not
move forward in a random, haphazard way.
They have not that appearance of desultory
verisimilitude so common in the modern
English novel. The structure of his work
is logical, and the various parts are developed
in accordance with a subtly-conceived plot.
For him, as for French writers, the novel
is not merely a story to amuse—it is a rigor-
ous unfolding of an abstract idea by means
of character. Nor is that all. Galsworthy
is closely akin to the French in the critical
spirit which has so completely taken posses-
sion of his mind. With but few exceptions
English jvriters of past generations showed
a great respect for religion and the estab-
lished order of society. Dickens, indeed,
waged relentless warfare upon abuses and
denounced privilege ; but this hostility sprang
from the overflowing kindness of his heart.
He saw people suffering unjustly, and he
proclaimed it vehemently. He held privi-
lege and incompetence up to ridicule because
he saw that poor, inoffensive men and women
were often caught in the meshes. His soul
overflowed with pity and indignation, and
he was voluble in his expression. Galsworthy
is different. His attitude and literary
methods are different. His criticisms and
his satire proceed from the lucidity of his
intellect; the man is carried away neither
by indignation nor by pity. He is clair-
voyant. In this restraint and calmness he
resembles certain of the greatest French
satirists.
Like the French romantics, Galsworthy
has constituted himself the chapyjiou of
Art and Passion against the attacks of
acquisitive Philistines. In French opinion
this gives to the Englishman’s work a
peculiarly Gallic flavor. In proof of this
let us refer to the best known of his novels,
“The Man of Property,” in which he has
drawn the picture of a rich London family
of the upper middle-class—the Forsytes—■
'whose very name is significant. The out-
standing characteristic of this family, especi-
ally of Soames Forsyte, “the man of pro-
perty,” is the instinct of possession. The
author’s conception is developed through the
antagonism which arises between Soames
and Bosinney, an architect and an artist.
The conflict between these two men concen-
trates upon two points—first, on the house
which Soames has commissioned Bosinney
to build for him, and, secondly, upon the
possession, of Soames’s wife, Irene. The de-
velopment of the novel falls logically into
three parts. In the first, which is the expo-
sition, Bosinney begins the house, and falls
in love with Irene. Then comes the double
knot in the action in the second part • Bosin-
ney, wishing to create a work of art, exceeds
the sum which Soames was willing to devote
to his house; he becomes the lover of
Soames’s wife, and seeks to take her away
from her husband. The third part brings
the d&nouementj Soames brings a law-suit
against Bosinney which ruins the architect *
moreover, Soames retains possession of his
wife, and Bosinney dies. Property has van-
quished Art and Passion. Here is an abstract
idea followed to its logical conclusion.
Ten years before the publication of “The
Man of Property” Louis Dumur, in his novel,
Pauline ou la Liberty de TAmour,” made

OPP. G.P.O., —far Service —SYDNEY
a study of a very similar situation, racial,
a bourgeois husband like Soames E orsyte,
perceiving that liis wife has no love tor him,
strives nevertheless by all means to retain
possession of her. The character ot the
heroine is very different, however, tor
Pauline is brainy aud self-willed; Irene is
weak and impulsive. Facial, like Soames,
is a “good husband,” and Galsworthy s
phrase upon Soames might well be applied
to him : “He could not understand what she
found wrong with him. It was not as if
he drank; did he run into debt or gamble
or swear; was lie violent; were his friends
rackety; did he stay out at night ? On the
contrary.” It is precisely this regularity of
life —this bourgeois rectitude —which irritates
their wives. Although they make every effort
to love these men, devoid alike of imagina-
tion and sensitiveness, they do not succeed.
They have therefore ceased to share the con-
jugal bed, to the surprise and indignation of
their husbands. But Soames aud Facial
have a profound respect for the institution
of marriage. They judge their wives’ con-
duct to be due to mere caprice, and try to
reconquer them. In both novels we have
the same crisis and the same conflict ending
in a parallel scene —the husband desires to
possess his wife in spite of her resistance.
There is a clear difference, however, in the
manner in which the inevitable scene is
treated. Facial seeks to take his wife by
sheer brute force; Soames acts with cunning
whilst she is asleep. But the resemblance
is in the conception of the scene and its
meaning. The daring lies with the French-
man. Both Galsworthy and Dumur seek
to show that the union to which the wife
does not consent is mere inexcusable viola-
tion.
By the power of his art Galsworthy shows
the force of passion. “The figure of Irene is
a concretion of disturbing Beauty impinging
on a possessive world.” After belonging to
her lover, Bosinney, for the first time, Irene
goes home and the author describes her: —
She came in with her latchkey, put down her
sunshade, and stood looking at herself in the glass.
Her cheeks were flushed as if the sun had burned
them; her lips were parted in a smile. She stretched
her arms out as though to embrace herself, with a
laugh that for all the world was like a sob.
This description recalls to mind unmistakably
that of Madame Bovary after her first inter-
view' with Rudolplie L
Mais, en s’apercevant dans la glace, elle s’etonm
de son visage. Jamais elle n’avait eu les yeux si
grands, si noirs, d’une telle profondeur.
The parallelism is clear and indisputable; it
does not depend only upon a similarity of
detail; the glass, the brilliancy of the
features ; it rests also upon the same desire
to mark the change which comes over a
woman’s face through the ecstasy of passion.
Passion brings with it not only beauty but
death. Here we find another striking paral-
lel in French literature. In his noved “Fort
comme la Mort,” published in 1899, Guy de
Maupassant draw's the picture of an artist,
who is also the lover of a woman belonging
to another. For him love, as for Bosinney,
has become irresistible, destructive, stronger
than death itself. Mad with love and power-
less jealousy, Bertin rushes through the traf-
fic of the Paris streets, and is knocked down
and crushed by a passing carriage. In each
novel the author finds himself in the same
uncertainty—w r as it an accident or was it
suicide? In De Maupassant’s story someone
says to Bertin after liis accident, “You threw
yourself under that carriage.” In the same
w'ay certain people seem at first to believe
that Bosinney committed suicide. Bertin’s
reply was “Je n’ai pas regarde autour de moi
—je pensais a autre chose, atout autre chose
oh oui!” In the same way in Galsworthy’s
novel w r e have the truth spoken by young
Jolyon; “No one so madly in love committed
suicide for want of money ; nor was Bosinney
the sort of fellow' to set much store by a
financial crisis?” And so he rejected the
theory of suicide. These resemblances _ both
in the principal crisis of the story and in its
denouement are of a remarkable character.
Yet the essential originality of Galsw'orthy
is never onee called into question; for, what-
ever suggestion he may have unconsciously or
consciously received from French literature,
his treatment is the result of his own per-
sonality and genius.
FRANCIS AACKSON.
“The Golden Bough”
“ Order of Merit: Sir James Frazer, Fellow of
Trinity College, Cambridge; author of ‘The Golden
Bough.’ ” —New Year honor announcement.
The guide-book said, “Vetturina to Nemi,
not recommended”; so we took a tram.
That sordid conveyance rattles you to the
front doorstep of the Forum and into the
square of St. Peter with the same noisy
nonchalance, and if you do not take it you
will not escape the devastating clangor of
its bell. So we took the tram. It was
crowded, and I gave up my seat to a pro-
testing, dark-skinned, lovely damsel, only
to find that the seats were first-class fare
and second-class was “standing only”; and
the guard made me resume my place. The
Philistinish thing on wheels lifted us
straightway out of the chaos of ruin and
renascence that is Rome into the flat cam-
pagna that is Rome’s chief problem, to-
wards the Alban Mountains. They looked
hard and saw-like against the fragile sky.
We passed the arches of the Acqua Felice,
broken up into groups like megaliths of
Easter Island; and the tombs of the Appian
Way, like any Chinese landscape, flashed
continually by. Up one tooth after the
other of the saw-like mountains the packed
tram clawed its way until on a precarious
terrace overlooking Italy it found Frascati.
Some of the w T ine and all of the beautiful,
shady and v T ell-watered villas of Frascati
we left behind and proceeded on our way.
We passed Albano, and looked at the
tomb of Pompey (“called such without
authority”), and so up into mountain mist
and gusts of rain. Our bell clanged, and
the mist lifted and fell again, and we stopped
in Nemi’s street (“Tratorria Desanctis toler-
able, bargaining advisable”).
But the miserable village of Nemi was not
onr Mecca. We w T alked up the sloping
street to a break in a ragged wall over
which rubbish had apparently been shot for
a million years. The torrent of tins, paper,
rubble, ash and bits of tvdsted iron flowed
like a stream of molten lava down into
steaming depths. A shabby priest leading
a shabby donkey stopped and told us that
under the raging mist lay what we sought.
This is the spot where J. G. Frazer s famous
theory had its birth. It starts in the centra
mystery of the strange priest-king of Lake
Nemi, who in the height of Roman civilisa-
tion guarded night and day a sacred tree
in the sanctuary of Diana at Ancia, about
20 miles from Rome. In his hand he car-
ried a drawn sword, and he slept only at
the peril of his life. He was a priest who,
to obtain the had murdered his
predecessor, and who, sooner or later, would
be murdered in his turn by the next aspirant
to the priesthood. This bloody rule was no
local custom. It was the law of the sanc-
tuary, endorsed by the Government and
maintained by the hierarchy. The Emperor
Caligula once intervened when a priest had,
in his opinion, outlived his. usefulness, and
sent a stalwart ruffian to dispute his reign.
The sanguinary rule persisted f r ° m primi-
tive times into the cultured era of.the Em-
pire; and a Greek traveller, visiting Italy
in the age of the Antonines, noted that even
then the priestship was the prize of victory
in single combat.
Thirty years ago Frazer set out to solve
the problem of the origin of this remark-
able rule. He wrote a short treatise on the
subject, but it only opened up fresh vistas
of perplexity before him. In the end the
rpiest occupied him for a lifetime, and in
the course of it he produced one of the
greatest achievements of the century. A
synopsis of some of the chapters of his work
gives an idea of the ground lie covered, and
of the endless nature of the search. Diana
and Virbius, priestly kings, the magical con-
trol of weather, departmental kings ot
Nature, the influence of the sexes upon
vegetation: the sacred marriage, the soul
as a shadow ; taboos on shaving the face, on
spittle, on childbirth; tabooed words, the
killing of kings when their strength failed,
the Whitsuntide mummers, human scape-
goats in classical antiquity, the seclusion of
girls at puberty, the Hallowe’en fires, the
ritual of Death and Resurrection—all
were links in the chain of . evidence. Like
those detective stories which jump from
city to city and country to country, he took
the whole world for his stage, and the tribal
customs of Australian blacks, the legends
of dead civilisations and the survival of
ancient customs in Christian festivals were
clues which led him to his triumphant syn-
thesis. He showed that the glittering facades
of modern ritual, the syllogisms of advanced
theologians and the dogmas of infallible
churches had their origin in the fears and
hopes of lost races with Cro-Magnon skulls.
He showed the essential brotherhood of
primitive greeds and passions which pro-
duced the murky marriage ceremonies of
Tasmanian natives, sent decapitated slaves
hurtling daily down the pyramids of Mexi-
can temples, made Syrian youths castrate
themselves, New Hebridean mothers murder
their offspring, European peasants seize
passing strangers and empty their blood
across their fields, and Palestinian commu-
nities elect a mock king and then hang him
on a tree so that his life essence should re-
juvenate the crops. He showed how the
black thread of magic, the red thread of
religion and the white thread of science
have run through human thought, how
astrology has given birth to astronomy and
spell-binding to psychology, and how the
primitive belief that any loin-clothed savage
could control the course of the seasons has
ended in a scientific command over nature.
Finally, at the end of his exciting chase, he
brings us back, breathless but exhilarated,
to the grove of Nemi, where the ghost of
the mock king, haunted by his shadowy
pursuer, still prowls around the sacred tree.
Much of Frazer’s theory has been dis-
counted since, but the value of his contri-
bution remains unchanged. He did for the
student of human religious origins what
Darwin did for the student of his physical
development. The bug-hunter of pre-
evolutionary times could only be a cata-
loguist of the eccentric ingenuity of an in-
comprehensible Creator. His industry re-
sulted in nothing but an accumulation of
unrelated facts. Darwin’s hypothesis
brought the facts into relation with each
other, and made the work of every observer
a link in the chain of evidence. In the
same way Frazer co-ordinated the observa-
tions of missionaries, travellers and traders
in the sphere of religious motives. He is
that rare combination, an artist and a scien-
tist; his style is as romantic as a poet’s
and ’his matter as symmetrical in its vast
detail as a Gothic cathedral. The new
abridged edition of “The Golden Bough” is
a book that every member of the “Abori-
ginalities” Council should have in his
matilda. In this handy volume is con-
densed the whole fascinating thesis that
Frazer elaborated, during a lifetime of re-
search, in the 12 large volumes of the ori-
ginal work.
What incense does a rationalist burn
when he enters the precincts of his shrine?
The friendly priest handed us the halter of
his ass to' hold while he rolled us cigar-
cttes.
M. G. SKIPPER.
Australian Production
Stan W. Grist has liis reply:—
In endeavoring to remove the scum from Bedford’s
thoughts on Britain, I am afraid that I stirred up
a cesspool.
Looking at this man’s shuffling and begging of
the question at issue, we find that in the first place
he has no sense of debate, no knowledge of logic. All
through his ravings he , assumes that under certain
conditions I would say certain things, and then
proceeds to criticise. In this way he assumes that
I would include the author of “The Sheik” as one
of England’s litterateurs. To my point re having
lived in three different parts of the Empire (and
therefore qualified to speak on the matters dealt
with) he assumes that if these three parts were
India, Sierra Leone and Malta, etc., such and such
would be the case. Following this line of argument,
one could say anything. For instance, I might
say that if Bedford were completely insane ne
might go and bury himself on a desert island. Un-
fortunately for Australia, this is not so! Several
times this Empire Builder says “Australia is not
British —it’s Australian.” Following this out logi-
cally, if I made a statement that bread is food,
Bedford would blow himself out and shout forth
“Bread is not food —it is bread.”
This pseudo-Australian in nearly every case twists
my words round to win applause for himself as
the champion of Australia’s rights against the impu-
dent Englishman. He alleges that I belittle his belief
in Australian production, and that I object to
Australian thought in Australia. He knows full
well, of course, that I dealt with two points only
of his article, namely:
(1) Australia is not British.
(2) England is a semi-illiterate country. (I was
grateful for the semi.)
If this is Australian thought in Australia, then I
must heartily object. But it is not. It is not
genuine thought, and it is certainly not Australian:
it’s the Bedfordian type of thought, but a type,
nevertheless, that can do quite a lot of harm to an
insular country like Australia. I should despise an
Australian who did not consider his own country the
best in the world; but let us at the same time try
to develop an international outlook on world affairs.
Bedford is at his best when he takes my words re
the Singapore Base out of their setting and twists
them to fit his own warped vision. He knows that
my statement was merely a reflection of true Aus-
tralian thought on the casual attitude of the man
in the street towards important questions like
Defence. During the many years I have lived in
Australia, every leading paper, every prominent
thinker, has urged the country to realise its duty
towards building up a strong Australia by attention
to (1) Defence, (2) Immigration. Now, I don’t
want Bedford to shelve the issue and with tongue in
cheek shelter behind the deeds of the Anzaes. Because
the Australian is true to his British breed, and is a
great soldier, that is no reason for our taking no
heed for the future. With regard to Britain’s work
re the Singapore Base, it is interesting to read the
remarks of the Chief Justice of Victoria, just re-
turned from Europe, at the A.N.A. luncheon. He
says “Britain’s burden [Singapore is one fraction
of it] is almost more than she can bear. The way
she is bearing it leads me to say that the highest
compliment that can be paid to any Australian is ;o
say he is of British blood.” Bedford, on the other
hand, living under the protection of the British flag,
boldly asserts “Australia is not British.” Chief
Justice Irvine put the true point of view forward
very well when he said: “The only brotherhood that
will save Australia is the brotherhood of British
blood.”
Everyone agrees that we must have millions more of
Britishers in this country. Now this is Bedford’s
welcome to them as they come here, mostly wav-
scarred and anxious to make good with their kin in
this country; “The only races for Australians were
at Gallipoli—races against the Turks, re-taking
trenches originally taken by Australians, handed
over to English troops and lost by them.” I
won’t be dragged into a debate on such a point
with one who talks along those lines. I have
read Australian history pretty thoroughly, and I
think I know where the Bedford type come from.
Fortunately for Australia, not one man in ten
thousand thinks as he does.
In launching my criticism of Bedford’s “Australian
thoughts—really the thoughts of a small Brisbane
clique—l had in mind another favorite phrase of his:
“To talk of cutting the painter from the Old Country
is so much waste of time—the painter is gradually
rotting away.” Now, it’s all very well for my
Australian friends to say “You shouldn’t take any
notice of Bedford';'we don’t.” They know;' but the
all-at-sea new-chum, anxious to feel at home, doesn't
understand. He has not adjusted his perspective so
as to pass off so lightly the fact that a member of
an Australian Parliament can express such thoughts
as those criticised by myself—and labelled Australian.
Coming to the literary section, however, Bedford is
on surer ground. His clever coining of the title
“If Winterbottom Comes” is good and reveals a depth
of culture; his subtle disposal of J. M. Barrie as a
“pap merchant” and G. B. Shaw as a journalist i 9
clever gallery play. In the same way we could
turn down Masefield as a dribbler, Bridges as a
hymn writer, Mason as a Deadwood Dick specialist,
etc But you see it doesn’t get us anywhere, it's
simply cheap talk to appeal to a section that does
not know any better.
The Australian public evidently tolerates Bedford
as a sort of literary Percy Brunton, just as we all
tolerate the street musician who interrupts us in
our serious work with his discords which jar our
finer feelings. The analogy goes still further, for,
strange to say, both men get beer-money out of it.
A Satchel of Books
The Vested Interests, by Thorstein Verblen (Allen
and Unwin). A reprint of newspaper articles. The
author defines a vested interest as “a legitimate right
to get something for nothing, usually a prescriptive
right to an income which is secured by controlling
the traffic at one point or another,” and points out
the growing antagonism to such interests shown by
‘‘the common man ’ who is not vested with any such
prescriptive right.
Cargoes for Crusoes, by Grant Overton (Appleton,
Doran and Little). Three publishers have joined forces
in launching this useful book. The “Crusoes” are
such members of the public as may be cast upon
the island which is remote from literary shores anl
are without knowledge of what is doing in literary
centres. To them are conveyed stores of informa-
tion as to books in the market and the “cargoes”;
they carry. Beside cataloguing current fiction, it
gives interesting snapshots of writers whose names
are widely known —Gibbs, Farnol, Edith Wharton,
Oppenheim and others. It is aptly described as “ex-
plorations among new books and favorite authors.”
The Honorable Miss Cherry Blossom , by Luellen
Peters Bussenius (N, J. Brown and Robertson and
Mullens). This is a novel cast in Japan and ricn
in color. The story turns on an American in Tokio
falling in love with Cherry Blossom, through the
ingeniously contrived, if not very convincing, decep-
tion of a living picture. The reader is carried
through exciting incidents in an unconventional and
alluring environment up to the day when the great
earthquake and subsequent fires destroyed the old
city. The author appears to be thoroughly familiar
with the life of Japan, and elaborates that side of
it which still remains untouched by western hands.
Modern Masters of Etching (Studio, London). The
first volume of this new series ►leals with F rank
Brangwyn, and contains admirable photogravure
reproductions of 12 representative plates of this fine
craftsman, and a well-written introduction by Malcolm
C. Salaman. One interesting point the latter brings
out is in reference to the melodramatically over-
emphasised contrasts of light and shade in Brangwyn s
etchings—looked on by some as due to inky smears
which the etcher’s conscience should not allow. This,
it appears, is really the work of the professional
printer ; Brangwyn himself, with liis colossal output
in so many branches of art, finding it impossible
to print his own editions.
My Psychic Adventures, by J. Malcolm Bird (Allen
and Unwin). The author, the associate-editor of
the Scientific American, relates his experiences m
the world of mediums and spooks. He gives full
detail of various seances attended and leaves the
matter much where he found it. “There was,” he
says, “no expectation that I should bring away from
these adventures any general conclusions.” But in
one important respect his expectation was sur-
passed. He cannot believe that the whole of the
phenomena exhibited were due to hypnosis. As
generalisations, all hypotheses of hallucination and
hypnosis are inadequate; the phenomena are truly
objective.” He’ is satisfied that the phenomena do,
in fact, occur, and narrows down the issue to
whether their occurrence is due to fraud or genuine
mediumship. But he is still unable “to find that
anything whatever has occurred in my presence that
is in the least degree demonstrative of survival
and communication and activity on the physical
plane by deceased humans.”

The Riders.
Red as her heart was the hunting morning,
Winds were blowing their bugles ot bliss.
The grasses sighed with the tempests warn-
But my mouth was sweet with her kiss.
Stirrups of silver in fern-green leather,
Bridle with red cornelian bossed —
I lifted her light as a flying feather
On the airs of the autumn tossed.
Far we rode with the great horns blowing,
The bristled hounds nose-down on the
grass,
And the scarlet cloaks about us flowing,
By the old mossed walls of the pass.
Heavy clouds from the westward flowing
Lashed grey rain on the wind-swept hill;
Somewhere beyond our sight aim knowing
The hunt swept down to the kill.
Sudden and shrill was her flying laughter
Caught on a wisp of fiercest air
“Follow! The hounds of the storm come
after!”
And the rain was wet on her hair.
Stirrups of silver in fern-green leather.
Scarlet cloaks by the wind blown tight,
Far we rode in the shouting weather
Through the valley of Lost Delight.
* * * *
Heavy clouds from the west are flowing.
Grey rain lashes the cold grey hill;
Somewhere beyond my sight and knowing
The airs have her laughter still.
Stirrups of rust in dull brown leather.
Hodden cloaks by the wind blown free,
Sin and I rode a while together,
But sorrow rides with me.

A Ballad of Greenness.
Yesterday the rain poured down;
Roof and tree with water dripped.
Greyly under Heaven’s frown
All the world with gloom was gripped;
Rut to-day the parklauds glow
In the golden sunlight’s sheen,
Breezes singing as they flow:
“After rain the grass is green!”
Though the sun’s delight was stale
In the summer, growing late,
Bitter seemed the driving gale,
And its tears an overweight.
Scorched to yellow in the heat
All the drooping lawns had been;
Now, fresh-springing ’neatli the feet,
After rain the grass is green!
Yesterday my heart was bowed
’Neatli the heavy hand of loss;
Trouble, like a darkling cloud,
All my visions swept across.
Yet, my grieving being spent,
Unce again life’s joys are seen;
I can sing with new content:
“After rain the grass is green!”
This is wisdom of the years,
Learned where joy and pain have been;
Life is sweeter for its tears —
After rain the grass is green!

I had heard many lilted love songs call
To Everywoman’s harlot-thought in me;
I had heard whispers that I dared not flee
Lest I he deemed responsive to them all.

prise
I saw the new love in my true love’s eyes
Greet with fine reverence my vestal soul!

THE SHEPHERD WHO CLIMBED A
TREE.
An opinion long prevailed that one Stickers
(front name William ) was the most con-
temned and friendless person in the Common-
wealth, almost every street being decorated
with a notice that his room is better than his
company. The question has lately arisen,
however, whether Prime Minister Bruce
hasn’t taken the place of the old-established
pariah in the matter of low esteem. That
superficially promising gentleman has had
his opportunity and been found wanting in
everything save indecision and flabbiness.
Nearly if centuries ago London had a fuss
which lasted a mere week, and the loss was
estimated at a paltry £lBO,OOO. Because the
Lord Mayor of the time was too cold in the
feet to read the Riot Act, and thus set repres-
sive forces in motion, he was tried in a crimi-
nal court for shirking, and found guilty. The
breach of the law in Australia has lasted
many weeks and cost many times £lBO,OOO,
and S. M. Brtice hasn’t read the Riot Act
either. It isn’t known that he has read any-
thing, except perhaps the cheque for his un-
deserved salary. Up to time of writing he
had done nothing with the great Communist
conspiracy, almost wholly engineered by viru-
lent outsiders, for the destruction of his own
country’s industries and institutions, except
bring about the languid arrest of Tom
Walsh, and that imported nuisance was
promptly out again, directing affairs as usual,
and appearing as counsel to make a mock of
the feebly-directed law and to throw veiled
insolence at the “sympathetic old Judge.”
Apart from this one arrest and a release on
nominal bail, it is hard to discover that
Shepherd Bruce made use of a single one
of the powers which ho possesses for the pro-
tection of the flock which he is paid to
safeguard. Rather he suggests the shepherd
who is found up a tree when a suspicious
animal appears in the offing. If he con-
sidered his powers insufficient he didn’t call
Parliament together and demand more,
though he said he wouldn’t hesitate to do
so. It might be pleaded that the rather
badly jointed Ministry ran a risk of defeat
if it had invoked Parliament. But a Min-
istry which is believed to have the courage
of its opinions, and to be ready to face a
dissolution—or, if it can’t get one, to throw
in its joint and several portfolio and leave
the next Cabinet to do the dissolving—is
treated with great respect by even the most
ill-jointed following. The Bruce Govern-
ment can only look forward to being treated
with no respect *'t all by anyone.
# tt * *
The latest response of the appeal of Tas-
mania was evidence, not only of the Min-
istry’s failure to deal with the situation, but
of its fatuous inability to recognise a situa-
tion when it sees one. For every year but
one since the Federal Navigation Act came
into force the island has suffered a period of
almost total isolation, always at the busiest
time of the year, when the loss is greatest.
The Act warns off non-Australian shipping,
and the Communist conspiracy on the main-
land warns off Australian shipping; and
appeals to time-serving and terrified
Federal Governments lead to nothing—the
only change is that the spells of isolation
become longer. At a recent date the posi-
tion was that the profitable tourist traffic
was “off” ; that the jam-factories were closing
for lack of sugar, the supply of which was
not even sufficient for household purposes;
that the fruit harvest was to a great extent
waste for lack of an outlet; that population
was diminishing, and that Federation as
run by the Bruces and the Hugheses was
an accursed thing and synonymous with
damnation. To people who complained that
they were being ruined Bruce said that he
was prepared to “consider any representa-
tions that might be made.” But he also
said reproachfully, and to show the useless-
ness of representations, that his Government
had already done everything possible. For
a Ministry which has at hand so much law
and legal apparatus, and which commands
a Parliamentary majority, some 4000 en-
listed seamen and a fleet of idle ships, the
everything doesn’t seem much. That un-
adaptable creature the caterpillar could
have done almost as well if its soul was in
its work.
* * * *
The time to go the whole Communist or
Soviet hog not having arrived, the present
insurrection will doubtless adjourn, so far
as the big conspicuous cities are concerned.
The popular idea about the programme was
probably the correct one. When everything
possible had been achieved to bring the law
into contempt, and to demonstrate the senile
decay of the Administration, and when the
revolutionary machine had had a good period
of training, the strikers would glide back to
work by instruction, whereupon the Govern-
ment would do nothing with great energy,
Bruce’s being the sort of Government
which doesn’t repair the hole in the
roof while the storm is on because the opera-
tion is difficult, and doesn’t repair it after
the storm because in fine weather a hole
doesn’t matter, and has the advantage of
letting in air. Out of a desire to avoid vin-
dictiveness no lawbreaker will be penalised
for damage done, nobody will be called upon
to pay. and nobody will be compensated.
Preaching of, and organising and recruiting
for, gory revolution will not be made high
treason, with the penalties of treason
attached. Revolutionary clubs will not be de-
clared illegal, nor revolutionary literature be
destroyed, nor will Revolutionists be shut out
of Parliament and other public bodies: still
less will non-Australian revolutionists be
sent back whence they came. So the next
uprising may be bigger and more successful
than its predecessor, and find the nation even
less prepared. But, despite the interval of
superficial trannuillity around the big cities,
Communism will continue to perform as
usual in outlying regions where respect for
the law as supplied from Melbourne has be-
come a back number. This, for instance, is
an ordinary and not a shipping-strike item
of recent date from Darwin: —
Seventeen colored men, armed with a rifle, a toma-
hawk, knives and sticks, proceeded to a farm eight
miles from town and compelled two charcoal-burners
to cease work and walk into town, and under threat
of serious bodily harm endeavored to compel them
to demand 4s. per bag for charcoal instead of 3s
Here we have a number of men who have admitted,
in evidence on oath, that they have done practically
no work for three years. They are well clothed and
apparently well fed. All of them are unnaturalised
aliens. Some have been in receipt of Government
rations for a long time... .They have meetings at the
police paddock, and two white men go out to these
meetings and advise them to stick together and
demand white men’s wages and conditions. It has
been found a losing proposition to employ any of
these people at the wages that the agitators have
coached them to demand. The Government has found
it cheaper to feed them....A motley horde of non-
descripts, who apparently are of no race, as they
show no evidence of any specific ancestry, who
won’t work, who are being fed and clothed and
provided with land on which they erect homes,
and who pay no taxes....
That is in the country where the Communis-
tic doctrine of international and colored
brotherhood is having a trial spin. The atten-
tion of Prime Minister Bruce is directed to
it. partly because the place being under his
direct control it is his direct and particular
disgrace, and partly in the hope that he
may become ashamed of his Government and
its ass-like patience with men who aim at
making all Australia, his native country, very
like Darwin.
REPRESENTATION.
Notwithstanding that we have had Mr. R. S.
Ross deploring the decay of oratory, there
are many signs that the world has got
rather sick of the sound of its own voice.
When modern democracy slowly emerged
from the confusion of the Middle Ages, it
laid stress upon the right to speak, and
argued that action would follow the proper
sort of talk. The history of Athens and
Rome might have raised a doubt as to
whether this would really be so; for in
those States the democratic experiments cul-
minated either in disaster or in the setting
up of autocratic rule. Rome’s sigh of relief
when Augustus took the job of national
management into his own hands is strongly
represented by the contemporary writers.
All Rome knew that in theory the position
taken up by Julius and afterwards by
Augustus was wrong. They could have
argued against the principle of the
new monarchy through years of rhe-
torical phrase-making; but when it came to
the reality by which they lived, they were
glad to have a little despotic action instead
of all the democratic talk. However, modern
Europe either thought it could talk a great
deal better than Greece and Rome, or be-
lieved that, with increased populations, the
increased outpouring of words would do
something finer, for it still pinned its faith
to discussion and forgot the clumsy machinery
which alone could turn argument into action.
It was partly that it liked talk for its own
sake. The mighty speeches and terrific ser-
mons of seventeenth-century England were
only possible because the people were then
capable of enjoying them: and even as late as
1890 speeches longer than an average novel
were delivered in the House of Commons and
listened to with attention. Democracy’s flow
of eloquence has been greater than an ocean
tide; but democracy’s achievements have
been rather meagre. Most of the allegedly
big things it has done refer to popular repre-
sentation on a wider franchise, which means
an extension of the right to talk. So the
alleged political freedom we enjoy is not
quite what it appears to be; the things done
bear too small a proportion to the things said
and suggested.
* # * *
That the freedom of the mouth is not very
satisfying is proved on the one hand by the
rise of despots like Mussolini and on the
other by party systems such as those we
suffer under in Australia. Even allowing
that Mussolini rules largely by terror, there
must still be an enormous number of people
in Italy who accept Fascism gladly as a
means of escape from the perpetual confusion
of political tongues; and in the same way,
though the electors of Australia have still a
pathetic faith in speech-making, the parties
have long ago decided that Parliamentary
discussion must be allowed to mean nothing.
Dozens of speeches are still made for and
against every legislative proposal, but no
votes are influenced by the talk. The party
members take their seats and their oaths
on the complete understanding that they will
obey the party machine and allow no argu-
ment of any kind to influence them. The
only sure effect of all the rhetoric which is
covered by the popular idea of democracy is
a great hampering of action: it produces
long delays in carrying out the most obvious
reforms. One capable despot could do as
much in a busy day as a whole Parliament
can accomplish in a long and eloquent
session.
Democracy was said to be on its trial when
the lands of most talk undertook the conduct
of a terrible war; but in reality democracy
—in its existing forms—had already been
tried and found wanting when the war itself
broke out. By the real will of Europe that
war would never have been ; but the talk of
Europe failed to translate that will into
peace. Yet the democratic organisation of
the nations looks as if it should work. The
theory is attractive that the elected represen-
tatives of the people shall meet together and
persuade one another as to the best means of
dealing with each national or world problem.
There is no obvious reason why the present
system should fail except that in practice
it does fail. There is, however, one case in
which the representative system has again
and again been shown to succeed ; that is when
a comparatively small district or organisa-
tion elects its representatives and watches
their procedure after they are elected. On
the evidence of experience the first require-
ment of representation is a personal know-
ledge of the representative. The idea that
such a knowledge can be gained from the
speeches of a candidate is one of the fallacies
which are still clung to by great numbers of
citizens. Clearly, the representative who is
to be really known by those who may elect
him must be one of them, known to them by
life and deeds and by the conduct of his own
affairs in their midst. The representative
who is only known by the carefully con-
sidered harangue he gives. at the street corner
is the whole secret of the failure of demo-
cratic methods. He is so far removed from
the majority of the electors that he regards
them as a mere detail of an elaborate party
game he is playing. His purpose is not to
represent them but to secure their support,
not to be their leader, but to trick them into
thinking he knows their business better than
they know it themselves. And so it comes
about that men who would not be trusted in
the smallest matter by those who know them
can become prominent politicians and be
described as representing large and fairly
intelligent constituencies.
* * * *
In looking for a means to save democracy
and avert the rise of the personal despotisms
which always come to the lore on its proved
failure it would be wise to seek a
proved success, and endeavor from that
to work out an effective system. Demo-
cracy has shown itself to be effective in small,
homogeneous constituencies ; therefore small
homogeneous constituencies should form the
basis of the State. And this, in effect and
in essence, means a great extension of local
government. Of course, in a country like
Australia a national legislature of a repre-
sentative kind would still be required; but
it seems probable that more sincerely true
representation could be secured by the vote
of soundly-chosen local bodies than by the
direct vote of citizens who have been merely
talked by a perfect stranger into giving him
their votes.
REALITIES OF RACE.
Nobody who lias wandered, however casu-
ally, over Europe will have failed to note
how little national boundaries have to do
with the frontiers of race. One can meet
the phenomenon even in Asia, on that great
tentacle of Europe, the Trans-Siberian rail-
way, where big, black-bearded dolichocephalic
porters stand on the platforms alongside
little, square-headed, stocky, Mongol-like
peasants who look more Asiatic than the
Aryan-featured Turkoman camel-drivers. In
Moscow you accost tall, long-headed, blue-
eyed men with fair moustaches, speaking to
them confidently in English, only to find
that they are Russian too. In Finland,
again, you find the little, fiat-faced man you
had seen in Harbin and Vladivostock. In
Berlin the blue-eyed men are fat and few,
and the small, round-headed type seem to pre-
dominate. Standing later in a sunken lane
in English Cornwall you hear two farmers
shouting to each other across a field. Cor-
nish has for a hundred years or more been
a dead language, but their English is utterly
unintelligible; and looking at them you see
a new type, long-headed, small and dark,
which is not what you supposed was Eng-
lish, and is unlike any you have seen be-
fore in this itinerary. If, however, you are
returning to Australia you meet the same
type, much degenerated, first at Gibraltar
and then at Naples and Port Said. If this
racial jigsaw puzzle has set you wondering,
you need thrash your brains no longer.
There has been much measuring of skulls of
late, and anthropologists have solved the
riddle for you. Buckle explained history
by the influence of environment; Brif-
fault, Cakr-Saunders and others interpret
it in terms of tradition ; the anthropologists
claim that the failure of Jack Cade and
the success of Napoleon Bonaparte
could both be explained if we could only
get the length and breadth of all the skulls
crowned or cracked in the careers of each.
* * * *
Lotiirop Stoddard is the spokesman of
the protagonists of the skull theory.
Europe, he says, is divided up between three
races: dark long-skulls, dark round-pates,
and fair long-heads. South Central Asia is
the vat which brewed the short, slender,
swarthy long-skull. He is_ a joyous, fickle,
intellectual, artistic, passionate, unpoliti-
cally-minded soul. He is social, yet indi-
vidualistic within his groups. He fol-
lows magnetic leaders, but his attempts
at government have been unstable, and
he has usually gone down before the
onslaughts of the fair long-hend« and the
round-skulls. We call him the Mediterranean
race: he is to be found in Southern Italy,
Spain and the fringes of the Balkans. West
Central Asia is the hive whence swarmed
the swarthy round-pate. He is a sturdy and
tenacious creature, but stolid and unimagi-
native. He is of the earth earthy, and his
descent upon Europe has had the irresistible
slow momentum of a glacier. He has a
strong sense of group solidarity, but his
groups require a despotic hand to mould
them into nations. He has pushed out the
dark long-skulls wherever he has met them,
and the fair long-heads he has absorbed by
sheer weight of numbers, leaving them
as a thin top-dressing of aristocracy upon
the racial surface. He belongs to the Alpine
race, and has sat down squarely in France,
Germany, Turkey, Russia and Central
Europe generally. The frozen north-east of
Europe was the first stamping-ground of
the tall, fair-haired, blue- or grey-eyed long-
head. He is a proud, warlike, restless,
enterprising, individualistic person, domi-
neering amongst inferiors, but democratic
within his own communities. He is more
intellectual than the dark long-skull and
more energetic than the round-pate. He is
a pioneer of trade, exploration, science and
invention, and his is the only race that has
set up enduring political institutions. He
is the Nordic, and because of his restless-
ness and his love of fighting he lias con-
stantly lost ground before the Alpine. The
Thirty Years’ War, the American Civil
War, and the Great War were a terrible
slaughtering of the Nordic race, _ who are
slowly being pushed towards' the' western
fringe of Europe. Scandinavia is almost
pure Nordic, and Britain is mainly so.
* * * *
Now with this new yardstick you may
make a fresh estimate of history. The srreat
period of the Vedas was due to an eruption
of the blue-eyed, jovial, hard-fighting, chival-
rous Nordics over the plains of Hindustan
4000 years ago: fond of good food, drink,
fresh air and exercise, they despised the
little, monkey-like aborigines, and, setting up
a rigid color line, remained, like their
descendants, the British in India to-day, a
ruling race. It was the fusion of the artis-
tic Mediterranean with the invading Nordic
that produced the great age of Greece. The
French Revolution was the uprising of the
swarthy long-skulls and the dark round-pates
against the aristocratic Northmen who had
dominated them since the fall of Rome. “Bet
us send them back to their German marshes
whence they came,” shouted, the dark-haired
mob, and screamed with delight when the
executioner held up by its long, fair tresses
the head of some French lady. The sober,
courageous way British statesmen have
faced the post-war problems of Europe is
due to the Nordic strain. It is the fair-
haired long-skulls that are paying their debts
and remitting the interest on the money
owed them by fickle round-pates. Pigeon-
chested Berlin clerks went marching to the
conquest of the world because Nietzsche,
TBEITSCHKE and others told them they were
“big blonde beasts” of super-men. They lost
the war because actually they had become
two-thirds Alpine without knowing it. Dur-
ing the war and since, Swedes. Danes and
Norwegians, almost a purely Nordic stock,
kept their heads, not because they had better
instructed ones, but because they were long
and fair.
* * * *
Despite the fact that the exponents of this
creed make vast assumptions, there is some
basis for it. That Italy, for instance, can-
not sustain either an autocracy or represen-
tative government for any length of time is
probably due to the circumstance that the
dark long-skulls of the South don’t under-
stand democracy, while the fair long-heads
of the North refuse to knuckle down to
tyranny. The penalty of enclosing different
breeds within the same national bounda-
ries is political instability. A glance
at an Australian crowd confirms the
suspicion that the Briton is a mixed sort of
person, too. But that the mixture, which
was brewed so long ago, is a true one and
the ingredients have fused is shown by the
fact that it is now safe to joke about it.
Although the time has not yet come for
equipping our Customs officers with measur-
ing-tapes, something might be done in the


way of adjusting quotas of immigration
along American lines. The country of the
Melting Pot has found that breeds don’t fuse
as quickly as was expected, and that large
lumps of alien do not absorb the new tra-
ditions of a land of liberty, but bring their
own traditions with them. Consequently
Uncle Sam has largely slammed the door on
Southern Europe, while leaving a side
entrance open for his Nordic cousins.
THE MAN WHO LOST IRELAND.
Time will show how far British ex-Prime
Minister Lloyd George is prepared to go
in the frenzy of his damaged vanity. He was a
continuous office-holder for 17 years, finish-
ing with six years as a Prime Minister who
was kept in office by the loan of a party.
Now 21 years out of office seem to have
made him wild enough for any venture. The
position is that in a House of three parties
and some oddments he is head of the smallest
crowd and the one which looks marked out,
if any one is, for disappearance, and he has
been little loved by the elder stodgers of that
attenuated force since he acquired the front
place by sending Asquith into the back-
ground. He isn’t even leader of the Oppo-
sition, for Macdonald’s much larger follow-
ing secured tlieir man that post. There is not
the remotest prospect that the Conservatives
will ever make overtures to him again. There
is no prospect that Labor will either, unless
he can bring his party with him, which is
unthinkable. Amid all these mixed condi-
tions the spasmodic little Celt made a sudden
uprising the other day as a sower of dissen-
sion among what remain of the Allies. Mus-
solini was his target:—
Fascism is a counsel of despair. Freedom lias
been completely suppressed. Arson, intimidation
and murder are now the instruments of yovernment.
Liberalism is now the country’s only hope, and
the great Liberal Oklaxdo, Sal-
as dha and Nitti —are moving towards a new Struggle
for Italian freedom.
A great friend of mine, a Liberal statesman in
Italy, dared to express an opinion in a newspaper.
His villa was burned down, and he was practically
driven out of his native land. You saw what
happened to another Italian statesman. He was
murdered.
Italy presents the rare case of a country
which got half-way down the slope of Hell
and scrambled back. The Soviet regime was
in active preparation when Mussolini took
a hand, and the final event seemed so near
that the Russian gang prematurely an-
nounced the annexation of the country to
its league of socialist client-republics. It
had innumerable agents there, and was ready
to supply capable executioners at the short-
est notice. Beginning witli job control of
shipping, as in Australia, the movement de-
veloped into Soviet control of railways and
posts aiid telegraphs, and the “taking over”
of factories. Socialistic Governments, or
despicable and cowed Governments, like
those of Nitti and Giolitti (a gentleman
who had been suspected of Hun agency dur-
ing the war, and had to go into retreat for
a while), tried to buy a respite by legalising
the acts of the revolutionists. The army
might have proved loyal if it had been called
on, but no one had the courage to call. The
king, like Louis XVI., isn’t known to have
done anything. A time came when the red
Hag-hung out over 2000 Italian towns, and
when life was cheap.
Then the nightmare blew away, because
the Red party was short of a Lenin or a
Robespierre, and there appeared on the
other side a man with Garibaldi’s knack
of improvising and leading forces, and at-
tracting their devotion. There was very
little bloodshed then or afterwards, and, so
far as is known, there is very little now,
though a politician, described for the first
time as a statesman, was done to death six
months ago by parties unknown, and the
house of a member of the anti-Government
party was burned at some date unspecified.
Possibly a fellow-feeling exists between
the erratic Nitti and the weathercock Lloyd
George, because the latter also had a great
civil commotion on his hands —though, being
in Ireland instead of in the actual home
country, it wasn’t liable to be actually fatal
• —and in the matter of bungling the way to
surrender he was quite as successful as the
other great Liberal. There is no reason to
believe that the Sinn Fein movement had
any important hold on the people then. They
were much more anxious to run no risk of
upsetting the very favorable settlement they
were making with the old landlords than
to supply He Valera with the Presidential
chair that his untamed soul craved for. To
avoid “conscription” and to make lots of
money out of the war, as the United States
did, was a more promising outlook than fight-
ing for a name and a shadow. At the elec-
tion which dispersed the Home Rule party
and put the Republicans in its place, the
voting, where there was a contest and a vote,
on behalf of Sinn Fein was not one-third of
the possible. When the Government roped
in a lot of prominent leaders it had a way
of opening negotiations for a peace, and re-
leasing its prisoners that they might use
their good offices for a settlement—which
they never did. When, by a spasm of energy,
it broke up the whole machinery of the Sinn
' Fein courts and had the remnants of the
Sinn Fein conscript army on the run, it
agreed to a truce so that polite language
might lead to the reconciliation of black with
white; and, instead, the Sinn Fein conscript
hosts were re-organised and re-armed. The
Lloyd George Ministry was feebly violent
at times, and violently feeble at other times,
but never anything very much or anything
very long.
The sudden end of its official share in the
business was bathetic, and tragic, and, more
than all. comic-operatic. The recognised
Irish leaders were invited to a conference at
which a new Lloyd George, with a lower
jaw that pretended to stick out like a cow-
catcher, presented terms. Insurrectionary
Ireland could have autonomy according to
the “Dominion status,” and could write its
own constitution. Failing acceptance, the
Government -would send across a real general
with very general orders, and a cubic mile
of men. and call the Sinn Fein bluff, if it was
one. And the leaders, being far from sure
about the bluff, consented. So the hostile
nurt of Ireland became the friendly Irish
Free State, and the Sinn Fein army became
an allied force—the Free State army. The
British evacuation began soon after. Quan-
tities of arms and military stores were either
handed n T -<w to the friendly troops or left
behind, which was much the same thing.
The South-of-Ireland Unionists, mostly
people with mansions left, but very little
land, had been disarmed by the British
authorities, lest their weapons should, fall
into the hands of the insurgents. This at
least showed that the Lloyd George Govern-
ment could disarm somebody. Nobody con-
sidered it worth while to return these
weapons, seeing that the dove of peace had
occupied the land, and that there was now
an established national Government to pro-
tect all and sundry. And when a large quan-
tity of munitions were left with the friendly
(late enemy) army it wasn’t even asked for
ss. deposit as a guarantee that it would stay
friendly.
So, when the Free State host to a great
extent joined up with De Valera and re-
sumed its republicanism, and began shooting,
largely with British weapons, at the Free
State Government, and the Treaty, and the
“loyal” Northern State, and at the disarmed
and abandoned southern Unionists, a terror
ensued that was worse than any terror which
had gone before it. But, as it had become
technically a local affair of Irish subject
against Irish subject, the Lloyd Georoio
Cabinet enjoyed a blessed feeling of freedom
from responsibility. It could wash its hands,
feeling that it had saved its face, for it had
supplied Peace, even if the article was stolen
in transit.
That was how some people began to talk
of the great Lloyd George as the man who
lost Ireland when it would possibly have pre-
ferred, by a large majority, to remain found,
and yet as the man who lacked the acumen
to lose the Ulster bcmndary problem along
with the rest. It is the one item of import-
ance saved out of the wreck. Between the
man who lost Ireland and the man who
almost lost Italy a bond may be understand-
able.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Skin-wliite Policy.
“If Australia is to remain a white Australia
let it do so in mind as well as in body.” So
said Judge Bevan at Goulburn (N.S.W.)
Sessions. Ilis Honor had sentenced a man
to 12 months, and declared him an habitual
criminal. The charge was burglary and his
record "was bad. In the Judge’s opinion
the case was really one for an asylum, the
man’s mental condition being probably below
normal and his emotional condition —used in
the sense of conscience—also subnormal.
“Why do we lag behind?” the Judge asked,
and pointed out that in England and America
provision is now made for the segregation
of mental defectives, while Maoriland, Vic-
toria and Westralia have each a more or less
adequate system for the reformation of such
criminals as are capable of being reformed.
N. S. Wales has all the information and
guidance it needs in the pages of the report
of a Royal Commission. It has gone just
that far, and with the complacency of the
public-service formula that “the matter has
been inquired into” there the business has
seemingly ended. Meantime we accumulate
defectives, mental and moral, not only such
as we breed for ourselves, but also such as
having white skins may come to our shores
for the refuge that America now denies them.
When is this country going to make an
effort at real whiteness, not the Whitewash
with which at present we befool ourselves?
What is being done about the immigrants
who are coming in from the dubious quarters
of Europe? What about the equally dubi-
ous child-life being born here and the tainted
lives of many adult citizens? (food, bad and
indifferent, all go into the civic melting-pot.
We look at their skins. “White!” —in they
go; some sort of national hotchpotch will
come out of it all! Whose affair is it?
Apparently no one’s. We boast about our
experimental legislation, talk about being in
the van of social progress, and at the bottom
of it all lies this cesspit of potential crime.
“Every mental defective,” says the Judge,
"is a potential criminal” ; and knowing this
—for it is a mere truism-—we sit with folded
hands and let the matter go on in the way
it did when Jack Ketch was hard at work
from sunrise to sunset. When are we going
to try a real spring-cleaning? Is the skin-
deep business going to last for ever because
inert and time-serving politicians fear to
soil their hands or lose their billets—-for the
unwashed count many votes? While they
snip at the little and relatively paltry things
on the surface, is this human rot at the base
of the community’s life to be left untouched?
To-day crime spawns where it will, and as
prolifically as it pleases; and its spawning
places are in an environment where the defec-
tive offspring have a rotten chance of evading
the hangman’s rope and the prison. Maori-
land is far ahead of us in its social vision.
There it is proposed to establish a Eugenic
Board with power to bring within its opera-
tion the feeble-minded, the epileptic, the
moral imbecile and the flotsam from the men-
tal hospitals. It is to be within the power
of this authority, such is the recommenda-
tion, to make sterilisation a condition of
release from institutions under the charge
of such hospitals, and. with other reforms,
to make marriage with any person on its
“index” illegal. That is a move in the right
direction. Meantime our administrators sit
and twiddle their thumbs, emulating the
policy of “wait and see” that nearly lost us
the war.

State Prevention of Railways.
The N.S.W. Public Works Committee turned
down the proposed Guya-Dorrigo railway
once more with the same monotonous thud
which awahs every scheme for connecting the
Northern Tableland or any other part of
the interior with any spot on the coast
except Sydney. The neglected North will
remain neglected till it manages its own
affairs, and that can’t legally come about
under the Constitution as it stands (for the
evil that George Reid did lives after him)
without the consent of Sydney and its envi-
rons. And in the Big City’s Pride of Bloat,
secured largely by the premeditated depopula-
tion of the remoter country districts, that
consent appears as likely as the spectacle,
in pre-war days, of Poland receiving its
freedom by way of a Christian present. The
secession movement has become rather dub
in the North and South, partly for lack of
enough people to move, and partly out of a
limp realisation that no secession was ever
brought about by the humble skim-mil'k
methods now in use. But no organisation
exists, or is likely to exist, which is capable
of suddenly informing local political head-
quarters that its district has resigned its
membership, and advising Melbourne (or
possibly Canberra) and London that a new
and loyal and ambitious State has entered
the Commonwealth and the Empire; so
matters promise to drift along indefinitely.
The art of organisation on a large decisive
scale, except through the agency of city
politicians, is very little known, or not known
at all, in Australia. There was a time when
public ownership of railways looked a noble
idea, though somewhat damaged by the
fact that all the money invested in the lines
was that of private foreign capitalists with
a right to a cumulative preference dividend
whether it was earned or not. In those days
there were actually dreams of paying off the
debt, and really owning the entire show.
But many things have happened since then.
The deist is now regarded as a
permanency. Borrowing abroad for railway
construction has developed into borrowing
for almost any kind of job or joblet, even
to raising new foreign loans to pay the
interest on old ones. The rate of remunera-
tion demanded by the cumulative preference
private-capitalistic shareholders lias grown
out of all knowledge. And State (or Federal)
ownership of railways has developed into
State prevention of railways. Over an
immense area of this neglected Land of
Promise the position is that the petty-minded
and purblind authority which runs the show
won’t supply necessary means of communi-
cation and won’t let anyone else do so. It
has become the stopper of Progress and the
bar to Civilisation——all out of deference to
some great vested interest like Sydney or
Melbourne, which loathes competition and
has many votes to dispose of. N. S. Wales
has many instances to show, the eternally
rejected proposals to connect the Northern
Tableland with the coast being among the
number. Victoria and Queensland have some.
A specially glaring case is that of the
South-to-Nortli line across the continent,
which might have been a working proposition
before this if South Australia had not re-
jected the offers of a big land-grant syndicate
and made its bargain with a faithless Com-
monwealth instead. In the matter of the
Prevention of Railways this has been quite
a remarkable achievement.

The Balance of Power and the Pacific.
Whether Australia does or does not sign
the Protocol, the old Balance of Power
game, which the involved document proposes
not to abolish but to keep in a condition of
suspended animation, will still go on. A
disquieting feature is its recent extension,
through the Russo-Japanese Treaty, to the
shores of the Pacific. It is the essence of
the game that the formation of one group
causes those outside it to sink their differ-
ences and crowd together for company.
Negotiations with this end in view have been
going on between the Mikado’s representa-
tives and the Soviet Legation in Peking
since 1922. They followed naturally on the
Allies’ abandonment of the Siberian expedi-
tion, which was one of the causes leading to
the failure of Japan’s attempt to convert
Russian territory into a Japanese province.
So confident were the Japanese military-
party chiefs of success that they appointed
nominated assemblies in place of the
local autonomous bodies, gave the Rus-
sian towns Japanese names, established their
own law courts, ' controlled the sale and
lease of land, and spent millions of yen in
promoting Japanese settlement. The unex-
pected return of the Russian Bear upset
these schemes, and Japan withdrew from the
mainland. She still, however, had valuable
pawns to play in northern Saglialien, which
she has been obligingly looking after in the
owner’s absence; and there are valuable con-
cessions in Manchuria and China. Modern
navies being run more and more on oil, and
Japan’s supply from the fields of Akita and
Nigata having of late years dwindled alarm-
ingly, Saglialien was of the most urgent
importance. The island kingdom already
imports more than half her oil supply, and
the commodity is growing so dear and scarce
that recently a number of factories which
were worked with oil fuel had to turn to
coal, also a shy mineral in the native soil.
Northern Saglialien was therefore re-
garded as essential to Japan’s industrial
prosperity, as well as her military security;
while its position as the last stepping-stone
in the strategic crescent which the Elder
Statesmen have so painstakingly consolidated
around the shores of farthest Asia gave it
an added importance. The Mitsui and
Mitsubishi companies, which are semi-official
concerns, planned to spend a million yen in
prospecting for oil in the Russian end of
the northern island, and were well on their
way to establishing a flourishing industry
when the Bear reappeared. Russia needs
the oil of Saglialien, too, but her immediate
want is an ice-free outlet on the Pacific;
while the great prize of the future, which
both parties are striving for, is the control
of China and her immense resources in
natural 'wealth and coolie labor. The recent
agreement is a compromise of all these con-
flicting urges under which Japan and Russia
are to exploit the Russian island jointly. The
original Japanese demand for concession in
one solid block, which the Russians objected
to for military reasons, has apparently been
granted; and each party agrees to respect
the “special interests” of the other in China,
Manchuria and other defenceless countries
where there is loot to be seized or shared.
The spectacle of the hirsute Bolshevik and
the lineal descendant of the Sun Goddess
creeping under the same coverlet is not really
unique. Nor does it embody any new prin-
ciple in international ethics. In fact, there
is a curious community of interests between
the tw T o parties to the treaty. Both regard
themselves as being rather in the position of
outcasts in relation to the rest of the world.
Society at large has slammed the door on
the ideas of the one, and the immigrants of
the other. This new shuffle of the cards will
doubtless make British officials in India look
with renewed interest towards the nor’-west
frontier and hurry on the pile driving in
Singapore harbor. It may also inspire
Uncle Sam to revive his old project of a
tunnel under Behring Straits. Tim thor-
oughly characteristic quality of the Balance
of Power is its lack of balance.
Wireless Makes a Bad Start.
“S.W.H.” on a wireless tangle:—
Australia is rushing into the wireless mess out.
of which the U.S.A. and Europe are just dragging;
themselves. On top of the howl about interference;
from amateur experimenters, and the still bigger wail
about the fixed wave-length idea, those who listen
to the broadcasting programmes —in Sydney, at any
rate—are realising that (1) the system of allocation
of wave-lengths is a rotten one; and (2) the sets;
sold by the dealers are not all they might be.
When Sydney’s two stations, 2BL and 2FC, were
given wave-lengths of 350 metres and 1100 metres
respectively, experts raised their eyebrows at the
big gap between. Explanations to the effect that the
gap would eliminate interference between the stations
looked sick, for anybody can build a set that will
deal with interference. In U.S.A. the same system,
of scattered wave-length was tried —and quickly-
dropped. Every broadcasting station there is now
below the 500-metre mark, and most are between
300 and 400. Short waves are more efficient, and It;
is easier and cheaper to build a set to cover a small
range. But the Commonwealth Government did not;
profit by the mistakes of other countries. When the
Melbourne station 3LO was opened, it was presented
with a nice millstone in the shape of a 1750-metre;
wave-length. The fact that it was practically im-
possible to build a cheap receiver to cover from 350;
to 1750 apparently did not trouble the authorities
at all.
The average broadcast listener pays a two-figure
price for a. valve set, takes it home, connects it up,,
juggles with about umpteen controls for hours on
end without result, and then rushes out to the wood-
heap for the axe. If perhaps he does get music at;
his first try it is distorted by static growling, harsh
valve noises, transformer hums and all sorts of queer-
sounds. You can’t expect a novice to work a set.
correctly when it takes an expert to get it in good
going order ; and it would take a genius to success-
fully operate some of the sets sold by Sydney dealers.
The same trouble occurred in America until Professor
Hazeltinio came along with his neutrodyne circuit.
Now America is a happy country. It would be just as,
easy for the Australian manufacturers to utilise this
circuit in their sets; it is open for all to use, not
being patented. Instead they make up sets with
circuits that are all right from the experimenter’s
point of view, but more than useless to the broad-
cast listener. The neutrodyne has one control, so
there is no fooling round with half a dozen dials
and gadgets. The one dial on the set is maiked with
the wave-lengths operating in the country, not with
a number of meaningless degrees. If a certain station
is required, the dial is turned until the wave-length
of that station is opposite the pointer, and there you
are. The size of the aerial makes no difference, for
the good reason that the circuit doesn’t use an aerial,
except nerhaps a small standard-size loop for distance
work. And the beauty of the whole thing is that it
is absolutely silent in operation.

The Cradle of Civilisation.
The expedition which is starting out to
discover an ancient city m the jungles or
the Amazon looks more picturesque than
likely to produce results. Still there is
no saying. El Dorado of early .Spanish
dreams was supposed to lie in that
direction; and that a civilisation may
have been cradled in South America seems
by no means unlikely. The Incas, with the i
clay buildings and rope bridges, had a ln»u
culture, but might easily have passed entirely
awav without leaving an authentic trace it
the Spaniards had not found their way into
Peru. An earlier civilisation, which seems
to have no link with the Incas, left giant
ruins in stone on the high tableland of Boli-
via. The civilisations of Mexico and Central
America were descended from something
which seems to have been on a still higher
plane. It has been the custom to trace
these indications of human advance, to some
impulse from the Pacific; but no reliable
links with them have been found on the
nearer Pacific islands. The fact that they
have practically nothing in common with
Asia and only a superficial resemblance to
anything in tlie Nile Valley has not prevented
some leading theorists connecting them with
Egypt—in fact, theorists have been ready
to connect them with anything and every-
thing, including the lost tribes of Israel.
That a common meeting place of all the
culture streams of ancient America should
be found in some unexplored region is by
no means impossible. What is very improb-
able is that even the discovery of great
ruins in the Amazon valley would indicate
that the whole world drew its cultural ideas
from that source. It is much more likely
that mankind while still in a very low and
barbarous state originated most of the simple
ideas which are the foundations of civilised
life. All normal children will make mud
pies without lessons in the art; and most
savages are likely to have tried the same
interesting pastime. Though Australian
aboriginals never made a pot, they made
many quaint figures of clay; and the stop
from the clay figure to the clay pot is not
so great that it would need to be carried as
a trade secret from land to land. Weaving
was possible once three blades of grass were
plaited; carpentering when the first man
cut a stick with a sharp stone; building when
stones were piled at the mouth of a cave
to keep out the wind. By mere practice
from these rude beginnings a civilisation
could be developed which owed nothing to
any hint from another group of men. It
would be no cause for wonder that in the
course of a hundred thousand years or so
the foundation arts of civilised life should
be independently discovered in a hundred
different and isolated countries. Once a cer-
tain point had been reached the cultural
process would go on with much greater
rapidity. Considering how much we have
lost of the methods and ideas of an age
as comparatively late as the Hellenistic
there is always a possibility of finding in
ancient ruins something which may teach us
more of the arts of life than we know. They
may have known how to grow a third set
of teeth in the Amazon valley; and that
knowledge would revolutionise the dental
torture-chambers of the world.

Suicide as a Political Argument.
“Nakhoda” is interrupted on a bridge:—
The petition from a hundred of the younger
Russian poets and writers to the Council of People’s
Commissars stating that if their flights of fancy
are to be subjected to the sub-editing of illiterate
Communists they will hang themselves is probably
no idle threat. Russia figs always been the land of

matriculate frequently save their parents further
bother by cutting their own throats. In 1905, after
the failure of the first or apprentice revolution,
hundreds of disappointed -Lenins and Trotskys re-
lieved an embarrassed Government of their presence
by means of bombs left over from the projected
holocaust of aristocrats. That indestructible notion
about the end of the world which seems to have
had its origin in a verse of Revelation induced
whole villages to immolate themselves at the end
of the Russian equivalent of a thousand years. So
great was the enthusiasm for anticipating the dead
finish that huge bonfires were lit outside the towns,
and men, women and children marched into them.
One enterprising person in the Petlouga Forest
built an immolator on a large and wholesale plan
with high brick walls. After relieving his clients
of their clothes and bank balances he helped them

Of anguish as they slowly starved to death might
have melted his heart if he had not steeled it with
the thought that all was for the best, and that by
letting them die in the odor of repentance he was
saving their souls from everlasting torment.
It is possible the Slav acquired this un-European
contempt of death through his Mongol ancestry.
Juvenile suicide clubs are popular in China, and in
Japan taxpayers show their disapproval of legisla-
tive acts by slitting up their stomachs. On the
very eve of the World War a fresh suicide epidemic
was raging in Russia as a protest against Czarist
oppression, or the visit of M. Poincare, or the forcible
suppression of a strike, or all three ; many observers
consider that revolution was threatening at the
time, and only the outbreak of hostilities with Ger-
many postponed it. The suicide mania in Retro-
grad was so severe at this time that a bridge over
the Neva which has always exercised a fatal fascina-
tion for the despondent was guarded by the police.
Examining its possibilities as a mere tourist, I once
caused a rush of armed gendarmes in my direction.
They explained that the dismal expression of my
face had made them fear the worst. I explained in
bad Russian that I had just eaten a perooski, which
had given me indigestion, but not quite badly
enough to make me long for death ; but having
Russian stomachs they did not accept my explana-
tion and were not happy until I had passed out of
temptation.
The number of suicides in Russia has been on the
Up-grade lately. In despotic countries they take
the place of by-elections ; and if the hundred youth-
ful literati Carry out their threat it may foreshadow
some changes in the Soviet regime.
The gutting of Melbourne Town Hall by
fire lias stimulated the energies of those
municipal reformers whose hearts are set
on getting the city’s administrative centre
shifted away from its Collins-Swanston street
corner. Their ideal Civic Centre is a palace
set back in mighty grounds on a command-
ing eminence remote from mundane affairs.
The present building, right in the heart of
things, among a network of tramlines, acces-
sible from almost anywhere by a three-
ha’penny fare and for concert-goers two
minutes from a last train, has long offended
them, largely, it would seem, because it is
so central, and handy. But the City Council
is likely to move with caution. Among the
new sites suggested are such locations as
the Eastern Market, opposite the Treasury,
in Spring-street: the Haymarket, on the city
bounds, at Elizabeth-street East; the Carlton
Gardens, sole breathing-space for a mean-
street suburb; and the ill-kept Treasury re-
serve. But the fact remains that all the
big blocks of Crown lands are held on a sort
of permissive occupancy which implies, if it
does not stipulate, that they must be used for
the purpose for which they were granted. Two
years ago, impelled by then Lord Mayor Swan-
son, a big building contractor, the Council con-
sidered a scheme to raze its antiquated West-
ern Market buildings in the merchant quar-
ter of Collins-street, and there erect a mighty
pile of sky-scrapers which would house as
much market as modern conditions demand
and leave enough offiees-to-let to in
tens of thousands a year in revenue. Wil-
liam Macpherson, then Treasurer, upset
that idea. He reminded the City Fathers
that the land was vested in them for a
market, and that if they no longer wanted
it for that purpose it would revert to the
Crown. He, as the Crown for the time
being, thought it would do nicely for a public
garden in that quarter, where the only gar-
dens now are a few aspidistras planted
round the street trees in William-street. That
was the end of the Western Market project.
It remains equally questionable if the
present Town Hall site can be utilised for
other purposes, such as subdividing and sell-
ing it to defray the cost of a new civic
centre. The other Town Hall school of
opinion advocates retention of the present
site and the erection thereon of a more im-
posing structure, the Council resuming the
Victoria Coffee Palace next door (which it
owns) to give a bigger ground area. The
Palace lease terminates this year.

Mr. Jacob Johansen, the alien who was one
of the chief fomenters of the seamen’s revolt
against the Government of Australia, has done
the Commonwealth at least one service—he has
shown the country what manner of authority
the Arbitration Court carries to-day under
the direction of Justice Powers. When the
farce of hearing the seamen’s objections to
de-registration was again entered into last
week, Johansen was called to give evidence,
and denied that liis name was Johansen
as set out in the affidavits: —
Mr. Dixon : What was your name in another lan-
guage ?
Witness: It was Johnson.
Mr. Dixon : In what language'?
Witness: I decline to answer.
Mr. Dixon: Are you naturalised?
Witness: I decline to answer. These matters are
all on record and you can search the records.
Mr. Justice Powers directed that witness should
tell what his name was when he came to Australia.
Witness: 1 do not know.
Mr. Dixon : How old were you ?
Witness: About 22 years.
Mr. Dixon: And you ask the Court to believe that
you do not know what your name was then?
Witness: The Court can believe what it likes.
That attitude in any police court would
have brought the ill-conditioned oaf _ a
prompt committal for contempt. If Justice
Powers, of the Australian Arbitration Court,
made any demur, it has not been recorded in
the very complete press reports.

“Macquarie Street” on recent losses to
Science: —
It is a malignant stroke of fate that two famous
professors of anatomy should be removed within a
few weeks, the one by enteric fever caught in
America, the period of illness lasting five days (Pro-
fessor Hunter lectured in Cambridge on December 5
and was dead in University College Hospital on
December 10), the other by a lift accident at Uni-
versify College, Aus-
tralia has reason to
be grateful to the
latter victim, the dis-
tinguished Russian
Professor Kulchitsky,
for paving the way for
the monumental dis-
coveries of Royle and
Hunter on the func-
tion of the sym-
pathetic nervous sys-
tem. Royle, after
writing a paper on
“Transverse Lesions of
the Spinal Cord,” was
in a fix as to the best
way of operating for
the relief of spastic
paraplegia. Fort u-
n a t e 1 y Professor
Hunter, in 1922-23,
served as an honor-
ary lecturer at Univer-
sity College, London,
and there he came
into contact with the
renowned Kulchit-
sky. The germ of the
operations for the re-
lief of spastic para-
plegia lay in Kulchit-
sky's “slides” (micro-
scopic “slides,” of
course, showing the
terminations of medul-
lated and non-medul-
lated nerves in striated
muscle fibres). John
Hunter at once per-
ceived the significance
of the non-medullaltd
and medullated termi-
nating in different
parts of the muscle
fibre, and the way was
clear for the two
Sydney pioneers in the
surgery of the sym-
pathetic system. New
words were coined to
meet the exigencies of
the case, and our
vocabulary became en-
riched with terms such
as “plastic tone” and
“contractile tone.”
The Sydney men’s
business was with
“plastic tone,” which
was controlled by the
sympathetic nervous
system. Therefore, in
due time, when it was
diagnosed that “plastic tone” was in excess, opera-
tions were devised on the sympathetic nerves which
have had astonishingly successful results, not only in
cases of paraplegia, hut in diseases of the stomach,
intestines, bladder, etc. Hunter’s methods of reason-
ing and masterly grasp of intricate problems remind
me of the great Pasteur, who used to go about
discoveries in the same way. “This, gentlemen, Is
the cause of puerperal fever,” and Pasteur at the
Academy of Medicine drew a germ on the black-
board. The only difference was that Hunter was
believed and Pasteur pooh-poohed.

A difference over the disposition of the
Red Cross funds in N. S. Wales has led to
numerous resignations from the society’s
high offices. There is perennial trouble
where moneys of this kind are concerned.
The split in this case occurred over a
majority decision to apply the remaining
assets to civilian T.B. patients, as well as
to returned sailors and soldiers. The minor-
ity want the money reserved for the people
for whose benefit it was subscribed. Much
the same trouble has arisen in every similar
case since the Crimean War. In England,
in the ’fifties, after the first fervor of dis-
tributing relief was over, the fund was so
tightened up that it became almost impos-
sible to get a penny out of it. It went on
increasing at interest, supporting several
oflicials in comfort for years, until at last
it was diverted by legal enactment into one
of the Government funds. The Queensland
Patriotic Fund for the Boer War ran the
same course. Some £30,000 lay idle for
years, in spite of many claims, and finally
it was grabbed for civilian hospital purposes
by the then Denham Government. It would
not have mattered had there not been many
injured and invalided men attempting to
obtain relief from a fund subscribed for their
benefit; and the diversion of the Red Cross
money to civilian T.B. cases would not mat-
ter now if there were not literally thousands
of men suffering from shell-shock, gas,
wounds and other disabilities due to war
service, who are either getting nothing at all
from a supposedly grateful country or are
in utmost daily dread of losing the few poor
shillings they do get.

If Russia was like any other European
country the news would indicate that the
end of the present regime is at hand; but
it isn’t. The great and ox-like Muscovite
mass is so accustomed to have a Czar (either
Romanoff or Zinoyioff or some other
“-off”) to rule over it, and a bureaucracy to
think for it, and an army and police force

to keep it in the muddy path, that a small
gang can run the show. If it passes out it
is because some other small gang is quicker
off the mark. The present Soviet Govern-
ment, weakened by the loss of Lenin, dead,
and Trotsky, deposed, represents an attempt
to get back to the original Ivarl-Marxian
purity of the Bolshevik movement, from
which the late leaders are said to have
deviated out of a sordid and not very
effective desire to find victuals for the popu-
lace. Influential but supposedly lukewarm
brethren are being locked up and shifted to
Siberia at a great pace, and in quite the
old style. Nothing is likely to hinder this
movement barring a mutiny of the regular
army, and mutiny isn’t probable. The regu-
lars are a well-paid and well-fed institution
in a hungry land, and they consist to a
considerable extent of unpopular foreigners
whose own safety lies in keeping together.
The ill-trained “conscript” militia, scattered
over 93 military districts and not allowed
to keep its gun at home under the bed, isn’t
likely to act except under proper orders.
In fact, the Russian seldom even riots save
under orders cither from the Government or
from some outside and probably “bourgeois”
organisation which is acting as :i sort of
Government. The astonishing thing is that as
many as 50 people should be found in Aus-
tralia to think that a political system designed
for and by such people could be applicable to
Australians with their free spirit and insti-
tutions and, above all, with their unexampled
initiative.

“Wilfrido” : “Sixenate” (B. IS/12/’24)
applauds the view of Judge Williams
(Vic.) that judgment creditors should not
bring debtors before the Court on affidavit
that they are in a position to pay up unless
the person making the affidavit has an honest
belief in its truth. I am not so sure about
it. Take an example. Smith and his family
rent a house from P.tones on a weekly ten-
ancy. The tenant has a steady job, hut
grows careless, and soon is five or six weeks
in arrear with his Tent. “Fay up or get
out,”- says Pjones. “Not on your life,”
replies Smith, who has interviewed Mr.
Costs. “I pay rent weekly : there is no
agreement as to the duration of the tenancy,
so the Law insists on a month’s notice—and,
don’t forget, damages if you attempt to. eject
me without a Court order.” The notice is
given, and Smith decides that, as he’s going
to be dispossessed, he’ll pay nothing further.
The month elapses; a summons is issued; at
the hearing Smith tells the magistrate he
can’t get another house, and asks for time
to look around. He gets another couple of
weeks, at the end of which he. goes out with
some 14 weeks’ rent unpaid and a judgment
against him for the amount. Pjones has
two remedies open to him. He can issue
distress proceedings unless (I’m writing of
M.L.) Smith is a returned soldier. But
what if rho Smiths have no furniture? The
alternative is to proceed by judgment sum-
mons. which must be accompanied by an affi-
davit that since the date of the judgment
Smith, after providing for himself and his
family, has had enough to pay the debt.
This is a matter for the Court to decide.
Surely P .tomes should not be prevented from
bringing Smith up on summons because he
can’t be sure whether he has the money or
not. x\t this stage it should be for the debtor
to prove that he can’t pay what he is legally
bound to pay, not for the creditor to justify
his action in seeking to obtain what is his
due.

“Sydney Native” barracks for some good
Australians
Ever since the North Shore railway was opened the
traveller has felt, on reaching Killara (N.S.W.)
and other stations up that line, that the worry of
catching a steamer, standing in a train and being
suffocated in the Lavender Bay tunnel has been worth
while. Surrounding Killara station for all these
years there have been areas up to some acres in
extent in which the only thing that makes this line
beautiful—the native timber —has flourished. Cer-
tainly, only sapling growth compared with the forest
giants that once clothed these hills and gullies—
but even so our own. Within the last few months a
large proportion of this has disappeared, and more is
apparently to follow. Admittedly, in the march of
so-called progress, much of our nearer bushland must
disappear ; but what is the kink in the Sydneysider’s
nature that impels him to destroy every stick of
native timber on the land he buys, and immediately
replant his plot with sombre pines, insipid-looking
camphor laurels or even perhaps the dullest of native
trees, the lofostemum ? Why is it, while other parts
of the world—America, North and South, Southern
Europe, India, Africa; in fact, anywhere, including
Victoria, South Aus. and Westralia —welcome and
plant extensively all species of our eucalyptus, we
in Sydney and suburbs apparently cannot bear tne
sight of them? The alderman’s ideas of street plan-
tation run to camphor laurels and lofostemums.
What could be more suitable for his purpose than
the flame-tree, for months a mass of glorious scarlet;
the Westralian red-pink, salmon or white-flowering
ficifolia, now bursting into bloom; the kurrajong,
shapely and slow-growing, like the others? Surely
in a half-acre of ground—-and hundreds of houses
have that and more—there is room for at least a
specimen or two of some of these friendly lodgers—
blackbutts, ironbarks, or angophoras, or the beautiful
pink-flowering sideroxylon or mugga, which blossoms
all the winter ;or the lemon-scented gum! Destroy
the native timber and you banish the native birds.
In a very few years the North Shore line will be
like any other Sydney suburban area, devoid of what
at present makes it beautiful. Again, what is it that
makes Sydneysiders hate the sight of gum-trees?
❖
Greater Sydney has now definitely passed
the million mark in population, having taken
another 27.000 inhabitants to its bosom dur-
ing the past year. It and the rest of the
rather barren county of Cumberland contain
more than half the population of the vast
State, and absorb almost all the visible
increase. Sydney is certainly a proud spot.
It has a water problem of some size, and a
housing difficulty and slum question that
invite inspection. There is anxious talk
about the need for removing from the city
streets the unpaid-for trams, and replacing
them with motor-’buses, which pack more
closely and to which many things happen,
including an occasional fall into a complete
stranger’s yard. If a large city is neces-
sarily happier than a medium one, while a
monster city is more blessed than a merely
large one, then the Ma Metropolis is well
along the road to ecstasy.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There should be a vacancy on the High
Court Bench within the next few days,
caused by the resignation of Justice Powers.
His appointment was regarded from the
first as a reward for services rendered to
and long personal friendship with a Labor
Prime Minister of very inferior mental
calibre, and nothing has happened to alter that
view. The Arbitration Bench, with Justice
Powers on it, has long been scoffed at and.
browbeaten, but it didn’t quite reach bottom
till last Friday. Then it decided that it
wouldn’t penalise the Seamen’s Union even
by the empty formality of de-registration (in
other words, by excluding it from a court
the decisions of which it treats with utter
contempt) for two reasons. One was that
the seamen were, at long last, beginning to
take notice of the Court, which they were
doing so far as it suited them or their lead-
ers, and no further. The other was that
they would object if the Court did anything
and would make a row. Not being a certi-
ficated prophet his Honor couldn’t tell
whether they would make a row or not, and
even if he was afraid of a row he shouldn’t
have assumed that everyone else was in
the same mood. Anyhow, it was his busi-
ness to administer the law, and the idea
that a criminal should not he dealt with
lest he becomes enraged and commits more
crime is dangerous as well as abject. There
was great joy in job-control quarters over
the decision. If his Honor had been a cele-
brated bushranger he could hardly have been
more popular.
An alleged “Town and Country Union,”
with Foreign Trade as its gospel, has been
started in Melbourne by Mann, M.H.R., the
queer Co.bdenite from Perth ; and Paterson,
M.H.R., who represents a dairying elec-
torate, has given it his blessing. So, of
course, has the Argus, which complains that
“the only Protection which the agriculturist
receives is when—as is fortunately now the
case—prices are very high.” As to that, tlie
tariff contains the following items: —
Butter, 2d. (M.L.) and 3d. per lb. ; cheese, the
same; eggs in shell, 9d. per doz. ; egg albumen, 2s.
6d. and 3s. per lb. ; do., yolk, is. 6d. per lb. ; honey,
2d. per lb. ; bacon and ham, 2d. to 4d. pel' lb. ;
mutton and lamb, 10 p.c. ; pork, 10 p.c. to 3d. per
lb. ; poultry, 2d. to 3d. per lb. ; milk, dried or
powdered, 25 p.c. to 4d. per lb. ; do., malted,\ 6d.
to Bd. per lb. ; do., condensed, etc., 2d. to 2 id.
per lb. ; linseed, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per cental; canary,
hemp and rape seed, 6s. to 7s. 6d. per cental;
lucerne seed, 3d. to 9d. per lb. ; maize, Is. to 3s.
per cental; oats, Is. 6d. per cental; barley, 2s. per
cental; beans and peas, Is. 6d. per cental; hops,
6d. to Is. per lb. ; broom millet, Bs. per cental;
almonds, 3d. per lb. ; peanuts, 4d. to 6d. per lb.;
sugar, 6s. to 9s. 4d. per cwt. ; vinegar, 6d. to 4s.
9d. per gal. ; unfermented wine, 3s. per gal. ; dried
fruits, 4d. per lb. ; currants, 3d. per lb. ; raisins, 3d.
per lb.; bananas. Id. per lb. ; pineapples, 6s. per
cental; citrus, id. per lb.; onions, 6s. per cwt.
If the “Town and Country Union” wants
to have a really exciting time, let it go
among the growers of raisins, currants,
bananas, onions, maize and broom millet and
request support for the removal of the duties
which are “oppressing” them.
Good Protectionists learn with regret that
ex-Prime Minister Hughes has been converted
and joined their party. He will never be a
good enough Protectionist to give the cause
any real help, and the news that the peevish
and galvanic uncertainty is now fully quali-
fied to lead the Protectionist party into the
bog of compromise and hesitation where he
always arrives is saddening. If any reason-
able amount would induce the recruit to
leave them and stay away, Protectionists
shouldn’t hesitate to find the money.
The Prime Minister, whose mildness grows
upon him till a curate is a raging lion by
comparison, has been at it again:—
Mr. Bruce told the Premiers’ Conference that it
would be unwise to restrict unduly the entrance of
aliens into the Commonwealth, as it might lead to
international complications.
In other words, the League of Nations in-
cludes Abyssinia, Albania, Bulgaria, China,
Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, India, Japan,
Liberia, Nicaragua, Persia, Peru, Panama,
Portugal, Siam, etc.; and the idea is that
this black-and-tan crew will object if its
folk aren’t admitted here freely. To which
the answer is that they will object harder
if they are shut out later, after they have
established a sort of prescriptive right to
come in, and that in the day of necessity it
will be no easier to close the door on the
Abyssinian without if the Abyssinian with-
in is dragging at the handle.
From a lobby in Macquarie-street:—
Evidently the N.S.W. Government feels that it
is in honor bound to appoint a Laborite to the
Senate vacancy, but surely it is not obliged to take
the nominee of the Sydney wirepullers functioning in
the name of Labor! Names prominently mentioned
in connection with the job are those of men never
heard of excepting as spouters of fire and brimstone
in the Domain, or as ringkeepers when something
or somebody has a stranglehold on the country. It
would not be difficult for the Government to select
a Labor man who would command a greater measure
of respect among the electors, and cut a better figure
legislatively In the Senate, than any person likely
to be recommended by the doubtfully representative
A.L.P. executive.
With 1500 votes to spare, Maurice Black-
burn won the vacant Fitzroy seat in the Vic.
Assembly after a fight in which much mud
was slung, though it is due to Blackburn to
A HEAVY LOAD FOR A TATTLE ’UN.
“The population of Sydney has just passed the million mark. The population of the whole of the
rest of the Star is estimated at only a few thousands more than that.”
THE BOY: “ Well, T can manage it now, Tut 1 don’t know what’ll happen when we have
to go up-hill.”
say that he took no part in the throwing.
First of all he was grudged his victory in
the pre-selection by about half of the defeated
30 of his own crowd. They and their sup-
porters had no use for the University man
to whom they were accustomed to go for
cheap law and non-paid guidance when they
got into tangles. So the disappointed ones
were either lukewarm or ready to vote for
any old candidate to express their resent-
ment. The idea of putting in for Fitzroy a
man who wouldn’t glorify beer and betting
seemed so monstrous to them that something
had to be done. So Blackburn was dubbed a
Communist, an anti-Home Ruler and the
rest, and the real reasons were kept in the
background. Boell. a Fitzroy councillor,
who makes ice in his spare time, was out
after the seat as an independent, and wasn't
to be blamed if he could capture it wffien
there seemed to be a split in Labor’s ranks;
but he has no reason to be proud of the
friends thrust upon him.
When the thankless job of fixing the blame
for the faked N.S.W. Labor ballot-boxes
was thrust on Theodore, all the factions pro-
mised to abide by his decision. But straight-
way there was a cry that the finding was
unjust to Bailey, M.L.A., boss of the
A.W.U.’s central branch, and the cry lias be-
come a roar menacing to the adjudicator,
an A.W.U. man himself. Being in Mel-
bourne last week on immigration business,
the Queensland Premier was sunihioned to
the A.W.U. convention to “give Ins reasons’
for arriving at the judgment. Instead of
the man came a letter saying that he re-
garded the question as closed; and the con-
vention, after rebuking the absentee, Passed
what was tantamount to a vote Of cOnfideilce
ill Bailey, Theodore seems fated to join tlffi
numerous band Of Labbritei? Passed out of
“the movement” for having tile coufage Of
tlieir convictions.
Tile N.&.W. Works Committee, being
invited to reconsider the proposed Guyra-
Dorrigo railway, turned it down once more,
presumably by the old majority of one.
There isn’t a single railway from the North-
ern Tableland to tlie coast, and over a fertile
and well-watered area 300 miles, long and at
once place 90 miles across there is no railway
at all. Therefore the work looks much more
promising than the crazy maze of parallel
and circular lines and lines that form four
sides of a square just west from Sydney. And
seeing that of the last 24 lines, mostly that
sort, included in the recent railway report 22
are bad money-losers, it was hardly worth
while to put on virtuous airs about the pos-
sibly unprofitable character of the Guyra-
I lorrigo affair. But the fear lest the North
should prosper enough to be able to vote its
own secession is a bogey that sticketh closer
than a brother.
Early in April the National Federation ill
Vic. will select three or four candidates for
the Senate. The retiring three are Elliott,
Guthrie and Russell (Nashers), and HanilaU
(he holds Barker’s Labor seat, and must
fnce the electors at next general election),
If the Cocky party is “reasonable’’ at its
convention next month the Federation will
graciously let it have a go for one of the
four seats, If the Cookies denounce pacts
and such things, then the Federation will
nominate . four, Presumably Elliott and
Guthrie Will be re-nominated, and Plain will
stand a chance. Russell, who lias been
indisposed for a year or two, will be heard
of no more in politics. Labor is busy com-
piling a long list of candidates for tlie pre-
selection of four. Hannan will be one and
Ilulse, one of the best known of railway
and A.N.A. men, will be another.
Monash, McPherson and Martin, the Com-
mission set up by Vic. Labor, when in power,
to inquire into the police strike in Nov., ’23,
has roundly condemned the revolt. At. the
same time, the investigators, who examined
100 witnesses, condemn Nicholson, Chief
Commissioner, for the way he handled the
trouble, and say, in so many words, that
the exasperating manner in wdiich successive
Governments ignored -claims for pensions
made the men more susceptible to the per-
suasions of self-appointed leader Brooks.
Nicholson is reproved particularly for two
things— (a) temporising over the removal
(or continuance) of the special supervisors
(“spooks”), and ( b ) sacking instead of sus-
pending the first 29 mutineers. There is
nothing direct in the report against rein-
statement, but no Government could, in face
of the strong denunciation of the strike, re-
employ any of the men who threw down their
batons.
There seems to be something very wrong
with the methods of the Queensland State
Advances Corporation, formerly the Agricul-
tural Bank. The Government, in settling
Queensland Diggers and others on the Daw-
son and Callide lands, laid it down that the
settler must confine himself for accommoda-
tion to this “Bank.” Apart from the fact
that the bank will not lend anything on
improvements of which it has not approved,
tlie advances it does make are so hedged
around that trading firms decline to have
anything to do with them. The unfortunate
settler, having made liis improvements aud
got his “advance,” finds that he can’t turn
it into supplies. “Our prices are for cash
with order,” one firm after another informs
the hungry settler; “we are not now dealing
with the State Advances Corporation, as
we found their business far too unsatisfac-
tory.”
The Speck's anti-Labor forces are to com-
bine for the forthcoming Assembly elections
tinder a new title. This time it is tile Town
and Country Political Federation. The name
appears to have been evolved at a joint meet-
ing of supporters of the defunct National-
ist Federation} and Of .the leading lights, of
the Country patty. . The iiew .organisation
has dtawii tip,a platform Of a dozen plankS;
the moht. Striking. Of tliO.iOt declaring for
flic abolition Of uhimprOved land-values ttfxd 1
tion. The new party issues an appeal to
the populace to assist in securing the nomi-
nation of six candidates of outstanding
ability in each of the five electorates. As
the appeal is made “without prejudice to
present members of Parliament, of any
party,” it is apparent that no revolutionary
sweep in the personnel of Parliament is con-
templated by the old party with the new
name.
The municipal trams of Adelaide knocked
off at the beginning of February the extra
Id. lately charged for every Sunday fare,
small or large. The Idea of putting it on
was to tax those who want service at a time
when it has to be paid extra for. The idea
of taking it off was to get an Increase of
passengers. This happened all right; the
first Sunday showed an increase of 13,000
passengers on the tally of the same day last
year—and a loss of £195!
The Sydney City Council’s activities re=

board, goes for his life while the going's

men, having WOn oj* bought a. majority}

scheme}, another to givC CMsUal employees
annual holidays on full pay, anOtlief to forpi
a city orchestra, and anothef to “immediately
expend” £96,000 on additions to the Town
Hall. All the jobs are to be done on day
labor. As Lord Mayor Paddy Stokes said,
with baronial hauteur: “It would be quite
useless to invite outside competition. Our
policy is day labor.” “And not too much
of that either,” he might have added. The
hours have already been reduced to 44 per
week.
The Sydney suburb of Woollahra, where
you’re hardly respectable if you don’t own
at least two cars, lias refused someone per-
mission to put up a building designed for
flats. This is nonsense even If it* is within
the law, and it probably isn’t that. Certainly
about two-thirds of the flats that have been
built in and about Sydney should have been
vetoed; not, however, because they are flats,
but because they are au offence to the eye.
Unfortunately, local-government ordinances
of N. S. Wales are so faulty that any
Cloth can put up any monstrosity On any
part of the harbor front or elsewhere pro-
vided it is solidly built of certain materials
and gives a certain quantity of air. The
Woollahra Council probably holds ( that the
value of property would slump itt its neigh-
borhood if flats were allowed there; but that
is simply because in and around Sydney flats
and Uhsiglitliness ate almost synonyms.
“Pip Tok”: One contingent pf JUgo-SlaV
immigrants had barely landed iii WeStralfit
and Settled down before they turned Up to
register their children for compulsory mili-
tary training. Having resolved to settle here
and make tlieir kids into Australians, they
seem to have thought this naturally the first
thing to do. It gives point to the home-
coming speech of Vie. C.. 1. Irvine, who
Warned Australia not to place dependence
upon any "new spirit of philanthropy In the
world.’’
They have a short way with Waisheviks
in France, even though Herriot, tile present
Prime Minister, has been to Moscow and
has recognised the Soviet Government, It
having been found , that many foreign plot-
ters arrive under the guise of laborers, the
police have been instructed to round up
these gentry every now and again and expel
them, A recent batch of deportees included
43 Italians, 7 Belgians, 0 Poles, 1 Serbian,
1 Swiss, 1 Swede and 1 German. There
are no protracted legal proceedings—merely
a search for papers, and if they arc not satis-
factory, conveyance to the nearest port or
frontier. The precedent is useful to. Aus-
tralia, now that it is struggling with a
foreign influx and foreign-made sedition in
the form of strikes.
The French Premier Herriot’s famous
speech on “the German dagger pointing at
the heart of France” recalls a recent photo-
graph of a march-past by German “reserve
officers.” The Huns are going by with rifles
at the slope, at the parade-marsch —the
“goosestep.” Since uniforms are barred, the
officers and other ranks are dressed in white
duck trousers, with evening-dress coats,
waistcoats, etc., and tall hats. A man will-
ing to appear in daylight in such a get-up,
even though he be a humorless German, must
be in deadly earnest.

“Commenting on the report that the population of
Sydney has now exceeded a million persons, the
Victorian statist (Mr. A. M. Laughton) said that
the population of Melbourne at the end of 1924 was
887,000. In four years Melbourne would hold a
million people.”— Argus.
What if our neighbor chortles in her glee,
And thinks herself a queen that she is fat?
As many millions shall we have as she
Ere many suns have set. Aye, more than that!
Our traffic problems make the Bumbles curse ;
Let us be proud to know they’ll soon be worse.
Our homing toilers battle on their way
Through crushes worse than Sydney ever has ;
The eddying masses make a kind of fray
Where cars and people mix in maddened jazz,
And in the tangled swirl old Death is fed—
The morgue gives weekly tallies of the dead.
Our cost of living, thank God, is as had ;
Our far-dragged spud is just as dear a thing,
And life’s a struggle quite as strained and mad.
Our cries of challenge to the high heavens ring.
Fitzroy’s as packed and sordid as the ’Loo !
Pull down your flag —we’ll spawn a million too!

“Jake”: The tough, cool bush breed runs
true in West Queensland, too. A lad, clearing
up some flood fencing the other day, withdrew
his hand from a clump of rubbish with a
snake attached to it. The lad was a long
way from any assistance, so he knew there
was only one thing to do. He placed the
finger on the top of a fence-post and chopped
it off below the wound with his tomahawk.
THE SKIN GAME.
“I'm a perfect ninny at figures. I can’t even
tell addition from subtraction!”
“Oh yes, you can. Addition is when you
make up your face for going out and.
subtraction is when you cold-cream it
off at night.”
And he wasn’t flustered about it: he first
killed the snake and made sure it was venom-
ous. Then, having used the tomahawk, h«
set out for home, to be conveyed to the hos-
pital for professional treatment.
“Tarwoona”: Mateship isn’t dead in the
Bush by a long chalk. No early records
can, I think, beat this modern instance. Two
old chaps, neither of them under 50. _ were
camped 40 miles from Blackall (Q.), enjoying
a short rest after a period of honest graft. In
order to enhance the pleasures of the holiday
they had provided themselves with a demi-
john of rum. All went swimmingly
until one morning they awoke with bursting
heads and tongues, like full-woolled wethers,
to the awful realisation that there was not
a drop left. With a heart-broken cry one of
them collapsed moaning on his “nap.” The
other, a mere lad of 58, was made of sterner
stuff. He caught his mare, unhoppled and
saddled her, and was swaying down the
road in no time. He arrived in Blackall,
marched into a pub, demanded a demijohn
of rum, and on getting it marched straight
out again. Never a drink, mark you!
to his horse he got, and off again to his
mate. Eighty miles in summer for a demi-
john, and never a drink till lie reached Ins
mate! Cheers for him, and cheers for his
old nag. too!

“Oxmead”: There are flowers of diction in
telegraphic messages that the G.P.O. lias been
known to jib at (B. 5/2/’25). In 1898,
when the so-called alluvial riots took place
at Kalgoorlie (W.A.) and the late Bigjohn
Forrest, essaying to calm the turbulent crowd
with oratory, was not only howled down but
subsequently poked in the ribs with an um-
brella, scores of sympathetic messages came
thick and fast to the victim of the outrage
from all over Groperland, and the ruffled
Premier handed them all to the press for
publication. Many were quite hysteric m
their righteous indignation; the most famous
of all came from Maitland Brown, R.M. at
Geraldton; it began: “My God, I am proud
of you; was afraid you might climb down,
and concluded with a quotation from Macau-
lay’s “Horatius.” Somehow old Maitland s
opening phrase hit the fancy of the public
and became a kind of mock-heroic slogan m
that roaring period. Everybody wanted to
use it in congratulatory messages. If a man
secured a seat on a roads board, or got
married, or floated a mine, or performed
any other meritorious feat, half a dozen
friends would rush to the nearest post-office
and despatch a “My God, I am proud of
you” telegram. Finally the Postmaster-
General of the day, himself a close friend
of Bigjohn’s, decided that the form_ of felici-
tation was blasphemous as well as invidious,
and issued instructions that no telegraph-
office should accept it. His decision was pro-
bably hastened by the fact that most of the
humorists insisted on trying to write the
historic phrase as one word.

“Mako”: The C.S.R. is one of the few
big business concerns that carry on without
; feminine aid, except for a couple of girls
at the ’phones in head-
office. The story goes
that, under pressure,
the chiefs once consid-
ered the advisability of
admitting Dolly and
Teggy within their
sacred doors, and the
permit to employ ty-
pists was ready for sig-
nature on the table of
the High Chief. He
paused, pen in hand,
meditating on the im-
portance of the step he
was about to take, and
his eyes strayed to a
window across the street
where a pretty little ty-
piste was sharpening a
pencil. At that moment the over-the-road boss
chanced in, and slipped his arm affection-
ately round the typiste’s waist,. That did
it: the document was never signed, and the
C.S.R. machines are still tapped by George
and Archibald.
* * * *
“Wealsman”: The dead-earnest nature of
Hobart merchants’ public protest _ against
Commonwealth failure to keep shipping com-
munication open between the mainland and
the Speck may be gauged by the fact that
nobody at the meeting guffawed, or even
sniggered, or visibly smiled, when former
Agent-General Ashbolt warmly denounced
the old local habit of “hushing up the real
facts that usually get side-tracked or clouded
by red herrings.” Nor when Seabrook,
M.H.R., declared: “There is no such thing
as Australian control of ships: they are all
controlled from London, by the Shipping
Conference. Boiled down to tin-tacks, that
is the true position.”
“F.F.H.”: Time moves slowly in the great
Outback, with its hundreds of miles to the
nearest store, and the people there learn to
wait. “You wait,” lie said as he gathered
up his change after paying the fifteen bob
fine to the smiling N.T. police officer, and
sauntered out of the office. For a technical
breach of a Gilruth ordinance the man had
been compelled to ride 400 miles —with this
paltry fine at the end of it. And while one
man rode away with a careless determination
to get his own back, the other sat with a
feeling of flouted dignity and determined
tty at he would deal out something more seri-
ous at the next opportunity. It was the
year after this that a party had got together
to prospect country west of the Overland Tele-
graph line and south of Tanami. We had
decided that two should go ahead to the
O.T. and then ride out and see how the rain had
been in the west, return to the O.T. and wire
back to Queensland to let the others know.
This meant a drag back of at least 200 miles
to Barrow Creek if the conditions were
favorable. It was then that the chap who
had been fined helped us. “What about get-
ting the police to follow us out? They
couldn’t very well refuse to carry back a
few wires and letters.” It worked like a
charm. A camel disappeared out of an
Afghan’s team (it was found some months
THE SHINGLE AGE.
JEALOUS HUSBAND: “Only met some women friends, hey? Well, how do you account for
this long hair that I found on your coat?”
later in an outside Queensland paddock) ; a
hurried exit of the advance party at night;
a few dark hints in confidence to the camel’s
owner; a few more hints to known talkers ; *
a buzz of wires from Queensland to the O.T. ;
and the advance party was followed by the
selfsame police officer. Three weeks later
he caught up to the advance party. Rigid in-
spection found our camels all our own. And
as no N.T. policeman is paltry enough to
refuse to carry letters and deliver them
safely, the news of plenty of water got back
all right. The police had made Jim ride
44)0 miles the year before ; he had made them
ride GOO miles this year.
“X.N.0.” : Touching long-distance gaps in
ages between two children of the same
parents (B. 5/2/’25), I knew two brothers,
both in the K.N., who had never seen one
another before the war. The youngest son
had reached the age of 25 in 1914 ; his eldest
brother had joined the Navy and gone to sea
before the baby of the family was born. I
am not certain that they ever did meet. If
they did it was at Port Tewfik or Port Said
in 1914, when the youngest was a lieutenant
in H.M.S. Mosquito and the eldest was cap-
tain of the Triumph. Both craft were in
the Canal about October, 1914, but if no
meeting took place then none . ever did. for
the junior was one of the first destroyer
casualties at the Dardanelles, being, blown
to pieces by a Turkish shell while directing
the fire of the Mosquito’s fo’c’s’le 4-inch gun.

“Quero”: Re pain where an amputated
limb has been (B. 29/l/’25), “X2X” states
that it disappears after about 24 hours. I
have known it last longer. Not long ago
I called on a woman whose leg had been
amputated below the knee as the result of
a tram accident. The operation had been
performed three days before, and I was as-
tounded to hear her say: “Although I’m
suffering agonies in my injured foot, especi-
ally in the heel, I don’t mind at all—l’m so
thankful they managed to save it.” It was
not until some days later that she knew the
foot was off.
“Swiss”: “N2X” (B. 29/l/’25) is quite
wrong in saying that the pain felt in the
vacancy created by the removal of a limb
disappears after a day or two. The late
well-known N.Q. sharebroker, Ernest Le
Neveu. used to get recurrences of excruciat-
ing pain in the foot of a leg that had been
taken off above the knee over 30 years before.
“748”: Touching the pain in a limb no
longer there (B. 29/l/’25). In Egypt in
1915 one of our sergeants had his arm ampu-
tated at No. 1 A.G.H., Heliopolis. The fol-
lowing morning the sister asked him how he
felt. “All right,” he replied, “only the pain
in my arm is bad.” She touched his right
arm. “No, the other one, sister,” he told
her. When he learned there was no longer
another one, he turned over and never spoke
again. In a few hours he was dead. Before
the war I knew a man whose arm had been
amputated some years previously. He told
me that when rain was about his missing
hand seemed to him to be clenched tightly in
his coat-pocket.
* * * *
“FY7”: The out-back Australian is de-
teriorating. A man proudly told a Sydney
police court the other day that he
had drunk 24 beers in one day at Mudgee 1
Whereupon a town-dwelling solicitor, in
awed tones, expressed the opinion that
Mudgee must be a hot place. Only 24 beers in,
say, an eight-hour day! A generation ago
in Townsville or the Towers a man who
could not do better than that would have
been pursued by officials of the lodge and
besought to accept office in the Good Tem-
plars.

“Harold Hardupp” : It was the best man
who made all the trouble at a recent Mel-
bourne wedding. The night before had been
a wet one, and when the intending Benedict
looked in at the chambers of his promised
bottleliolder on his way to church he found
him in a heavy sleep. The drunk, perversely
awakening, remembered his engagement, and,
arriving in church just before the “I will,”
offered to fight anyone who might be trying
to jump his claim. He proceeded to peel off
his coat in proof of his bona fides, and the
parson and the bride’s father, who had
THE MISER.
THE SEDE MAN : “When I returned
from my honeymoon I had just thirty
shillings left in the world.”
THE GOD-MADE GIRL: “Stingy thing!”
sought to convince him of his unreasonable-
ness, retreated in disorder before a pair of
whirling fists. Suddenly he announced dark
suspicions; the whole thing was a plot to
trap his best pal, and the plotters had got
him drunk lest he should lodge a last-
moment’s objection. This was the last straw
—the ’groom, with some assistance, ran the
contumacious person into the street.

BALLADE OF THE BUSTLE SKIRT.

“The Paris correspondent of the Daily Express
says: ‘The nexv fashions disclose that skirts are
shorter than ever. The bustle skirt has reappeared.' ”
The world rolls impotently on ;
No more there meet our startled view
The moa and the mastodon
That our remote forefathers knew.
The horrid pterodactyl, too,
From off the landscape has been cleared.
But—saints in Heaven I —is it true
The bustle skirt has reappeared ?
Top-hatted cricketers are gone;
N'o gabardine bedecks the Jew;
We dine no more on larded swan ;
We shoot no more with bows of yew ;
The mail aerial cleaves the blue
O’er roads where Cobb and Co. careered.
But —how does this appeal to you ? —-
The bustle skirt has reappeared.

The things that Fashion told her to?
But cast your memory back — or con

With hideous “dress-improvers” geared,
And on the fearsome item chew:

Be billowing wide and surging weird
Around those hapless forms whereon
The bustle skirt has reappeared?

“Centurion”: As a result of the destruc-
tion of the portraits of former Mayors in
the recent fire in Melbourne Town Hall, it
has been suggested that artists should re-
paint the pictures from old portraits and
“descriptions.” It recalls a yarn about
Millais. He was pestered by a Yorkshire
farmer, who had done him many services, to
paint a picture of his “owd fe-atlier” in the
fine old farm kitchen, with his “owd dog,”
Rover. Millais, always the kindliest of men,
went to the farmhouse with his gear. 'Roth
“fe-atlier” and his “owd dog” had long been
de-ad, but Rover’s skin was on the floor, and
that w’as something to go by. Furnished, in
addition, with a description of “fe-atlier”
and a mental picture of the kitchen, he went
home and executed the commission. When
THE FICKLE SEX.
“How are you getting on with your breach-of-promise case?"
“Rotten —the fellow wants to marry me.”
“Just shows you—you can’t trust them!”
the picture was delivered, the farmer was
delirious with delight. “Ma Gowd,” he said,
“tlia hast t’ kitchen tlieer aw reet, an’ owd
Rover—ha’s aleeve. An’ aay, but it’s t’ owd
man aga-an—but, ma Gowd, lioo ha’s
altered!”
“Nikko” : The cable editor is not the only one
who gets his messages mixed. During training
operations in Trentham Camp (M.L.) part of
the procedure was to send a message along a
line of men, each of whom whispered it to
his right-hand neighbor, frequently with
strange results. “Bear to the right” came
out as an indication of the presence of beer
in that direction, and caused great excite-
ment. But “I am going to advance: can you
send me reinforcements?” made the greatest
sensation. It arrived at the end as “I am
going to a dance; can you lend me three-
and fourpence?”
* * * *
“X2X” : Recent discussions concerning the
merits of hanging recall the report of a
commission which investigated the subject
in England. The majority of the commis-
sioners were satisfied that the old method
was as good as could be devised, but there
was a minority report which advocated
stringing the condemned person up, so to
speak, instead of projecting him downwards.
By this means it was claimed the cervical
vertebrae would be fractured much more effi-
ciently. But the idea never caught on,
although at least one modern text-book on
forensic medicine has advocated it, in pre-
ference to the method in vogue.
* * * *
“De Yinne”: Young Joe Higgle, who was
rather a neat dresser in his hours away
from the garage, used to racket down to
work every day in an ancient mass of wreck-
age, for which it was known that he had
paid only a fiver. One day he arrived by
the tram. “Where’s y’ car?” asked one of
his cobbers. Joe looked ruefully over his shoul-
der at the spot where he was wont to park
his 'bus. “Sold it,” he answered with a
sigh. “I had to buy meself a new hat.”
If * * *
“Barcaldine”: The quickest change from
military to civil raiment in all my experi-
ence was effected by a Brisbane Digger dur-
ing the demobbing period. Disembarking
late one afternoon, he was leaning over a
hotel bar blissfully unaware of a military
ordinance which forbade publicans to serve
uniformed soldiers after (i o’clock. At one
minute to that hour Bung broke it to him
that “this one must be the last. We can’t
serve you in uniform,” he said. Leaving
the just-drawn pint untasted, the kliaki-clad
one dashed into the. tailoring emporium next
door just as they were about to close the
premises. “Fit me up in civvies,” he gasped,
“quick an’ lively.” Clad in a ready-made
suit, with felt hat and fancy socks, he was
back in the bar before the froth on his beer
had settled.
“Yarrun”.: It was
in Paris, of course ;
where else could it
have happened? My
brother and I were
entertaining Eng-
lish relatives and
had led them for a
finale to one of t.lic
more respectable of
Montmartre’s all-
n i g li t cafes —a
fashionable and
well-conducted re-
sort. Entered a
while later two ex-
ceedingly pretty
girls of about 19,
wrapped in silken
evening - cloaks
above their dainty,
high-heeled shoes
and silk-stockinged
ankles. They saun-
tered to a table in
the centre of the
well-filled, b r i 1-
liantly-lit room,
and, in the most
natural way in the
world, slipped off
their cloaks before
seating themselves.
Above the level of
their silk stockings
not even a blush
clothed their slim,
white beauty. The
rest was tumult —a
shriek from the
horrified “patron,”
a rush of waiters
and a roar—three-
parts laugliter and
one-part horror—
from the guests.
Beauty, cloaked
once more, was
hustled out —and
my English rela-
tives are still talk-
ing about it! It
transpired later
that the girls won £lOO each from a certain
rich idiot by their act.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: Many a hero has been em-
barrassed by the discovery that the lady
whom he has rescued from a watery (or
other) death regards him, ipso facto, as her
soul-mate, but there is another side to the
picture. A Melbourne girl carelessly fell
from a jetty and was salvaged by a deserving
young man who was relieving the tedium
of factory life by a day’s fishing. Perhaps
the family overdid its expressions of grati-
tude in the letter which accompanied the sub-
stantial cheque pressed on the rescuer for
services rendered; and it is clear that it
hesitated to warn off the young man when
he called, having converted some of rhe
cheque into flowers, chocolates and an un-
wearable brooch with "In Remembrance”
worked in gold wire and colored brilliants.
But very soon the caller in the flash clothes
became an infliction ; and as he refused to
take the broadest of hints he was pointedly
forbidden the premises, and when he stiil
A SURF ROMANCE.
“So yon first met your wife when you rescued her from drowning?”
“Yes. She was carried out—and I fell in!”
persisted in prowling; around the object of
his devotion was sent away for a holiday.
The last act was staged in a suburban police
court, where the young man, still managing
to convey his belief that cruel parents were
trying to separate two loving hearts, was
bound over to be of good behavior. Even
the girl’s indignant declaration that lie was
nothing to her but a nuisance did not appear
to shake his conviction that by all the rules
of the game he had a matrimonial option,
so to speak, on the lady he had saved from
the cruel waters.
* * * *
“T.K.T.”: When first I visited Arltunga,
in the Macdonnell Ranges, there were only
two premises, the pub and the store, and two
townspeople, the storekeeper (Lake) and the
publican (Sandy McDonald), both since
dead. They were at loggerheads—one might
almost say “of course.” I stopped at the
pub, and I shall never forget Sandy’s descrip-
tion of the battle to that date, given to me in
the little box behind the bar which he called
his office. Sandy weighed well over 20 stone
and looked like some huge spider sitting in
his big chair. The battle was all law of the
sort that the bush ,T.P. deals out. As Sandy
started his narrative he marked “L” and
“S” on the blotting-paper, and as he came
to the amount of the fine and costs in each
of the cases he wrote it under the proper
letter —Lake’s win or Sandy’s. (In the latest
case to that date Sandy had given a swab two
bob to bring in an old tank. Lake had
claimed and sued for it, which cost Sandy
£2.) Finally Sandy added up the two col-
umns—Lake’s £53, and his own £54 12s.
There was real pride in his eye as he re-
marked : “So you see I’m still 32 bob ahead
of the blanker.”
“Tauwarra”: Old Bill from the Yodda was
resting at Billy the Cook’s (Samarai)
when a Mambare “boy” claimed his acquaint-
ance. “You savee me. taubada?” he grinned
expectantly. Bill eyed him closely, as if
striving to call his features to mind. “No,
my boy." lie replied: “I don't savee you.”
The lad seemed disappointed; then his face
brightened. “You savee me all right,
taubada,” he insisted. "You ’member, long
time lie go now, you bin shootem fader b’long
me?” The old man snorted. “Well, now,”
he growled, “ain’t you a vindictive little cow
to remember that after all these years!”
* * * *
“A.H.H.” on a curious subject:—
Quoting instances of man’s folly concerning deter-
rent and retributive punishment, “M.G.S.” (B.
22/l/’25) cites the trial of a goat for killing a
dog and of a sow and little pigs for eating a child
in Central Africa. The mind of the Central African
savage in such matters is much the same as was that
of the Frenchmen a few centuries earlier ; at Lavigny
in 1457 a sow and her six young ones were tried
for having killed and partly eaten a child. The
sow was condemned and the young ones acquitted
on the ground of their youth and their mother’s bad
example. A cow was tried and executed in France
as late as 1740, and French antiquarian research has
brought to light the records of 92 processes againsc
animals tried in the courts from 1120 to 1740. The
most farcical of the lot was not in France, but at
Basle, where a cock was brought to book in 1474
for having laid an egg. The prosecution called evi-
dence to show that cocks’ eggs were of great value
in compounding magical preparations, and that in
WILLING TO GO FARTHER.
“I’ve come to ash for your permission to
marry one of your daughters .”
“Will one he enough?"
Pagan lands Satan employed witches to hatch such
eggs, out of which were produced monsters peculiarly
injurious to Christians. Though counsel for the
defence pertinently asked what harm the rooster
had done even if it had laid an egg, the accused
was convicted and condemned, not as an errant
cock, but as a sorcerer. It was burned at the
stake along with the evidence of its guilt. At
Lausanne, in the fifteenth century, a number of
leeches were brought into court to hear an order read
for them and their tribe tQ leave the district. They
took no notice and were subsequently exorcised.
Exorcism of animals and insects was a recognised
Christian practice. The trial of domestic animais,
as distinguished from leeches, locusts, snakes and other
pests liable to exorcism, was based on Jewish law.

Gone are the dreams we dreamed of yore
When we were young and fancy free,
When to our eyes existence wore
The light that's ne’er on land or sea,
All vanished now! No more for glee
Our hearts within us leap and dance,
But thump tlie years out soberly.
Yea, truly, life is no romance.
Delights that once enthralled us bore;
The zest and delectation flee;
Love’s sweet excesses we deplore,
And banquets cloy or disagree;
Come sickness, grief, calamity,
And, while we start and stare askance,
Death, passing, cries “Remember met”....
Yea, truly, life is no romance.
We toil and sweat, we save and store;
In vain old fancies urge their plea,
In Arcady we roam no more—
The road’s forgot, we’ve lost the key.
As Time the ballet leads we see
The joys recede, the cares advance;
Each has his own grim weird to dree;
Yea, truly, life is no romance.

And snug in Mammon's fold are we.

SIESTA—MELBOURNE GARDENS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Noon floods its light upon the green mown lawns
Where shortened shadows, sweet with coolness, lie,
Or through the trees a lace of sunspots spawns;
Nature herself indubitably yawns—
A calm siesta holds the earth and sky.
The little clouds seem dreaming as they pass;
Locust and bird have muted both their note;
The water is unrippled, sheeted glass,
And the soft fragrances of flow’r and grass
Around us soporifically float.
Beneath the soft spread blanket of this heat
The landscape into slumbrous stillness falls;
Man only, wiser in his own conceit,
Toils on regardless in the crowded street
Where the loud, raucous voice of Commerce bawls.
Life in the city bustles on its way
With jerk and crush and jostle, push and pull;
Here only quivering boughs where light winds play
Sigh forth their full contentment in the day
And all the world that is so beautiful.

This co. has its headquarters in London,
which has supplied most of the money for
the business. The issued share capital is
£250,000 in ordinaries, £850,000 in 6 p.c.
cum. prefs. and £250,000 in 6 p.c. cum. "B”
prefs. free of income-tax up to 6s. in the £.
There is also £230,000 of a 4J p.c. deben-
ture debt. The ordinaries were issued to the
old firm of P., L. and B. in 1807 : and since
all subsequent issues of share capital have
been 6 p.c. prefs., the prospects for the
holders of the ordinaries get rosier as the
reserves pile higher. Not much importance
can be attached to the fact that till 1018 no
ordinary dividend was in excess of 6 p.c.:
the explanation is that ordinary divs. were
restricted to 6 p.c. until a reserve fund of
£lOO,OOO had been built up and invested
outside the business. Such a reserve now,
of course, exists; for although the table
shows only £83,390 of reserves, goodwill is
still valued at £161.192, so that the co.’s
accounts claim reserves of £244,582. There
are also large internal reserves: freeholds,
etc., which stand in the books at £387,890,

Prefs. (and they are the only shares in
which the public is interested) will observe
that (1) there are creditors for £709,076
standing in front of them, and (2) there are
only £250.000 of ordinary shares behind
them. But (1), apart from the freeholds,
etc., which are said to be worth £600,000,
there are liquid and semi-liquid assets valued
at £1,293.201; and (2) besides the ordinary
capital (£250.000) there are behind them the
steadily-growing reserves, visible and inter-
nal. Tlieir capital is thus pretty wrnll pro-
tected though not so well as in many pref.-
issuing cos.; and as for their divs., the pro-
fits in the past 10 years have been £552,640,
while the pref. divs. have called for only
£257,000.

During the year the co. issued the rest of
its authorised capital—£26.2l2 of prefs. The
issue tvas underwritten and flotation expenses
of £B5O appear in the present accounts,
although the last of the original flotation
charges have been wiped out. The additional
capital, however, was not enough. Authority
was therefore obtained in September last to
increase nominal capital from £150,000 to a
quarter-million, and since the close of the
accounts 30,000 £1 ordinaries have been
offered at par to shareholders and oversub-
scribed. The new money will be used chiefly
to equip Prospect quarry. The co. can do

The co. has been putting a lot of money into
plant; but this ought to help the co. to com-
mand its market and it may also reduce
labor costs. So far, considering the extra-
ordinary activity in all sorts of construction
jobs, there has not been a great margin ot
profit after paying the 10 p.c. divs.: there
ought to be more if the 10 p.c. is to be secure
in normal times. No doubts need obtrude
about the supply: that is practically inex-
haustible.

At one time the directors showed gross
profits, and deducted taxes and general
exes, in the light of day; but the practice
ended when the necessity arose to camou-
flage increasing profits. In 1023 the posi-
tion was rendered more obscure by bundling
up “provision for depreciation of invest-
ments” with sundry creditors; and in last
year’s accounts provision for contingencies
was included to still further obscure the posi-
tion. The fact that, notwithstanding these
gymnastics, visible profits were £1.0.060 greater
suggests that the co. may have been again
face to face with its old trouble. In earlier
years a conspicuous feature of the accounts
was the liberality with which profits were
put into new plant and then written off,
ostensibly against depreciation. When the
war brought such profits that their complete
burial was almost impossible, £50,000 of re-
serves were taken out of cold storage, and
there was an issue of £300,000 of bonus scrip.
Nothing mite like the conditions which led
to that distressing experience is likely to
have occurred lately; but the signs are that
the co. has been putting a bit by whenever
it could find a handy shelf. The assets are:
Land, premises, plant .. .. £777,728
Debentures .. .. .. 151,150
Book debts, investments, stock.. 346,805
Cash 10,107
a total of £1,285,790. The debentures repre-
sent the mortgage on the Pukeuri freezing
works which the co. sold in 1922 to the
Waitaki Farmers’ Freezing Co., Ltd. The
report offers no comment on the item. Ex-
cluding it from consideration, the liquid and
semi-liquid assets more than provide for sun-
dry creditors.
Prospects are bright. Few areas in the
world produce the liigliest-class mutton and
lamb; and this co. operates in one of them.
On past records a better div. would be pos-
sible. But the Board is no plunger. It
remembers that even the modest-looking 6J
p.c. is really 121 p.c. to old holders.

“Trade has been fairly satisfactory,” said
the directors in 1923, when the accounts
showed a net profit of £15,029. “Trade has
been well maintained,” says the Board now,
when the accounts show a net profit of
£14,936. Seeing that the amount was
smaller, what the Board had in mind may
have been the real profit, which was pro-
bably twice as great. Before the P. and L.
balance had been written, a round £5OOO had
been dropped into the insurance reserve, a
tenner thrown aside for contingencies and
£8946 added to general reserves. The only
visible windfall was from a sale of some
surplus Morpeth property, and that is more
likely to have accounted for the odd £946
than anything over that figure. The profit
may, in fact, have been still greater than is
suggested in the foregoing, for an unknown
amount was laid aside for depreciation, and
judged on its record the directors are more
likely to have been too liberal here than too
mean. In any case the 10 p.c. div. —the
seventh of its line—meant 15 p.c. to old
holders, for a 50 p.c. gift issue was made in
1920. Still, they deserved something, for
they got no more than 6 p.c. for a long chain
of years—a chain on which their legs were
pulled hard. When at last it became neces-
sary to tell some at least of the truth in
order to escape the exactions of the income-
tax people, it was confessed (in 1939) that
in 1914 the actual reserves were £BO.OOO
more than the £18,153 admitted at the time.
Since that date there have been some other
significant changes:—

In October, 1922, the co. purchased the
Gwydir, and that accounts for some of the
more recent movements. In 1922 ship pro-
perty was in the books at £156,466, so that
item has been reduced £8906 in the two
years. Simultaneously the co. is building up
its liquids : cash, public securities and deposits
were £11,569 greater than a year ago and
£26,252 greater than in 1922. At December
31, after accounting for liabilities and the
final div., there were liquid assets equal to
11s. lOd. per £1 share, and fixed assets with
a written-down value equal to a further
£1 2s. lOd. All of which is very comforting
to shareholders; and the fine industrial
growth of Newcastle must be grateful, too.

Automobile Finance Co. of Australia,
Ltd. (Melb.). —The co. is one of the young-
est in this line in Australia. At the start
it found difficulty in placing its shares and
had to recast its plans and issue a new pros-
pectus. In the original scheme the pro-
moters were to receive 30.000 fully-paid
shares—-1000 on allotment, 4000 more when
50,000 shares had been subscribed and an-
other 5000 when 300,000 shares had been
sold. Under the re-arrangement the pro-
moters’ cut has been reduced to 1500, and
500 of these had not been allotted when
these first accounts were made up. The
plan of opening in Adelaide and Sydney was
abandoned, although expense had been in-
curred in both States; and even in Mel-
bourne the co. really only began business in
August, when it was fairly certain of pull-
ing through. There was no difficulty about
finding customers for advances: every month
since August the co. has had more than
the amount of its paid capital at risk, lean-
ing for the smalt balance upon the bank.
From August 1 to the end of November a
net profit of £llOl was earned ; and as the
average capital was about £BOOO the return
was extraordinarily good. (Paid capital
was £4900 on August 1. and £13,837 at tlm
end of November.) Since the accounts were
closed an additional 40.000 shares have been
offered, and, in view no doubt of the four
months’ earnings, half of them were taken :
at January 30 the share capital had moved
along to £35,640, and the advances to
£37,631. Of course, it is too early yet to
tell how the business is going to pan out.
Losses don’t show up while you are advanc-
ing money: you discover them when you
are trying to get the money in. To escape
losses will undoubtedly call for very careful
management; but so long as the present
mania for “owning” cars lasts —for “own-
ing” them whether you’ve got the money to
pay for them or not —this and other cos. in
the business should make quite enough profit
to pay for all the knocks they will get. But
the investor has to back the management.
The paid capital as at November 29 was.
as mentioned above, £13,837; and £5209 of
this (less the profit for the term) was re-
presented by the promoters’ cut and pre-
liminary exes. It is a good deal of dead
wood considering the size of the tree; but,
if things go half as well as the four months
promise, it should soon be got rid of.

“Total profits, after payment of working ex-

the div. But the “etc.” and the “provision”

the conflict between this Column’s figures
and the co.’s. Here is the difference: —

And in addition to those etceteras an un-
known amount was written off against depre-
ciation. Whether it was sufficient only those
inside can say; and perhaps even they don’t
know. A mine is a wasting asset; but the
speed of the waste is a matter hard to deter-
mine. This co. owns Wallsend, .Tesmond,
Elermore Vale and Elermore Tunnel working
the Borehole seam at the Newcastle end of
the Northern N.S.W. field, and Pelton on the
Maitland field. It was established in the
’fifties, and, although its Newcastle mines
have returned a golden harvest to their pro-
prietors, Wallsend is now the only one of
importance. Pelton is of recent development.
In 1915 the freehold was purchased, and m
1919 production began. The fixed asset
appears in the balance-sheet, “less inner re-
serve,” at 1358,036, or £9160 less than a year
ago. Pelton is a well-equipped colliery (elec-
trical plants were completed in both Pelton
and Wallsend in 1923), and the total in the
books would not be looked at very hard if
it represented Pelton alone. The co. also
owns freeholds at Wallsend, but presumably
it has disposed of most of what.it had there.
The heavy expenditure on equipment hav-
ing stopped, liquid assets have begun to climb
again :

Liabilities are £10,054 less than they were
a year ago, and the liquids improved £31,803.
The co. has its assets handy, so that, should
it want to buy another property, it has only
to reach for its cheque-book. Meanwhile the
10 pc. div. is easy. The market values the
£lO shares at a steady £l4 ss. It must be
expecting something, because there is only
just 7 p.c. in that.

A fund of £l3OO held against depreciation
of furniture and fittings was not hitherto
regarded as a true reserve. Now, however,
the co. wipes off out of it £5Bl spent to re-
pair damages done during the police-strike
riot, and transfers the balance to reserves.
The profit on trading was doubtless assisted
by the calls paid during the year on the
10,000 £1 shares issued in the preceding
term. As at October 31 only 2s. 6d. per
share remained unpaid. The co. could do
with more, for its own debts are heavy. This

With a paid capital of £39.960 and total
funds of £45.141. freeholds with a book
value of £62.084 have been purchased; and
the co. has been long enough in the business
to know that the concern that borrows to
buy always takes a risk. Certainly it has
a chance of making a profit, too. What the
investor in these shares has to realise is
that the co. is more than a good old money-
lender :itis a lieayy borrower, too. And con-
sidering the amount of borrowed money
which the co. is risking, the surplus hitherto
shown after paying the 10 p.c. is none too
wide.

That takes up the tale at the reconstruction
in 1921. In the previous September share-
holders and debenture-holders had resolved
to reconstruct and provide tor further de-
velopment and equipment. From 1910, when
the co. started, down to this reconstruction,
not one div. had been paid. Each year to
1919 brought either local trouble or general
upheavals. Now, after 14 barren years,

lion has been taken out of the mine. Capital
is £113,762, a call of Is. having been made

32,000 held at the disposal of debenture-
holders, who exchanged their security for
8 p.c. debentures having a currency of 10
years with the right of conversion into
shares. Debentures now stand at £22,815.
Liabilities, apart from the debentures,
amounted at September 27 to £2852, against
which were £4935 in cash and £28.265 in
other more or less liquid items. Mine pro-
perty, plant and machinery are nominally
worth £120,653. The co. is working the
Borehole seam, which produces a high-class
coking coal, and its chief market is the
B.H.P. Steelworks at Waratah. If it can
hold that trade the future should be much
brighter. The equipment of the mine was
poor until two or three years ago. and the
improvement may make all the difference.
If it doesn’t, then, presuming that the share-
holders want dividends, the time will be
ripe for them to get hold of a man whose
report is worth £5OO to tell them what is the
matter.
Holders of the inscribed deposits of the
Australian Bank of Commerce will be given
the opportunity on Feb. 24 to surrender their
stock for shares. The proposal is that for
every £3 of inscribed deposits they shall
receive two fully-paid £1 shares. An agree-
ment has been entered into by the bank with
Kelso King on behalf of holders, but that
agreement, of course, will have., to be rati-
fied before it goes into effect. To be accept-
able to the bank the amount of inscribed
deposits represented by those accepting the
agreement must amount to a million, or
“such sum as the directors shall consider
sufficient.” As the ordinary shares sold at
255. KHd. on Monday, and as 13s. 9d. was
seller’s quote for the deposit stock on the
same day, the bank's offer is equal to 51s.
9d. for 41s. 3d. Although the inscribed de-
posits are terminable only at the bank’s
option, it is obliged to set aside £15,000 half-
yearly for their redemption. Last year the
£30,000 purchased stock with a face value
of £42,509. The bank’s intention is to give
holders “an opportunity of sharing in the
future prosperity of the bank” and at the
same time enable holders to realise at a
price near to the face value without wait-
ing for the slow process of redemption. The
shares allotted in exchange will participate
in the div. for the current half-year, but in-
terest will cease as from December 31 last.
The proposal will no doubt be accepted by
deposit-holders. It means that the holder
will have to write off one-third of the face
value of his security; but, as the market had
already done that for him, he is really not
losing anything, and stands to make a fair
recovery.

Since John Moule went to London with his
story the Americans appear to have lost
ascendancy. Nowadays it is a British-
run show, with the best Barrier practice
welded into the treatment. To dodge the
heavy English taxation the co.’s domicile is
now in India. Divs. are declared
in rupees, though paid in sterling. The
plan is to make the co.’s Bawdwin
deposits a part of the pivot on which
the English National Smelting Co. turns,
other constituents being Broken Hill
zinc concentrates. By getting control of the
Burma Corporation the most awkward
world’s competitor of the Broken Hill
lead combination was brought within the
fold. Lead and silver from Bawdwin have
"the East” as their market, while the zinc con-
centrates go to London, Belgium or Germany
as those in control direct. The big gun on
the Burma Board is Sir Robert iiorne,
the former Chancellor, who relinquished the
vice-chairmanship of Baldwins, Ltd., the big
English iron and steel masters, because he
had something more vital to attend to- —pre-
sumably National Smelting Co. and Burma
Corp. W. S. Robinson now also joins the
Board. The sort of raw stuff the Burma
Corporation has to handle shows the prize
that was won :

The South African Mining Journal
wants to hold an international gold-mining
congress and exhibition on the Rand simul-
taneously with the visit of the Empire
Chambers of Commerce in 1926. It argues
that, as S’Africa produces about 60 p.c. of
the world’s gold output, Johannesburg is the
most suitable place for such a congress, and
thinks that gold-mining would reap very con-
siderable benefits from discussion of methods
of ore treatment and other technical subjects.
The Bulletin hopes Australia will be there
and learn all the latest devices. Some of
our gold-mining centres are much behind the
times.
Westonia mines (W.A.) produced in a
few years over a million pounds’ worth of
gold, and then one after the other the
shortsighted cos. ceased operations arid sold
out. It is estimated that big tonnages of
payable ore were left behind in the drowned
and half-drowned workings of these dere-
lict shows, and a local co., confident of
Government assistance on a f-for-f basis,
invites capital to come in. Had its mines
been worked, as suggested by The Bulletin,
as one instead of separately, had the methods
employed been more scientific, and had the
market not been considered before everything
else, Westonia, now down and out, would
have been flourishing to-day.
Westralian mine buyers are watching one
or two new gold discoveries in the hope
that developments will lead to business. At
one find in the Glenelg .Hills, south-west of
Southern Cross, indications are favorable;
but something more than this is needed now-
adays to attract option-seeking cos. In most
cases they want something attractive enough
to drag in calls.

Development is proceeding above water-
level at. Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd., but the critical
work of sinking for the primary sulphides is
held up, the shipping strike having delayed
the delivery of steam winches. Floods will
cause further delay, and it looks as if three
months will elapse before there is much infor-
mation from the deeper levels. The directors
are anxious to get down another 100 ft. at
least before putting the field to the hazard
of the report to be obtained from experts of
the English financiers whom Corbould talked
to while he was in London. The official esti-
mate of one million tons of payable ore flown
to 100 ft. may be eventually doubled as the
lodes are driven on longitudinally. There is
no reason on the work done so far to expect
a less tonnage between 100 ft. and 200 ft. and
a revision of published analyses from these
levels indicate that the ore will be materially
richer for the second hundred both in silver
arid lead. The development of such an
enormous tonnage for a nine months’ cam-
paign has probably never been equalled'
before, and has rather startled It. M. Taylor,
of the Flat River (Missouri) Lead Mines,
who is favorably impressed with the field.
The question of an early start on a railway
to the field is to come up for consideration
within the next month. Corbould is now on
his way to the field.
It looks as if Mt. Isa Prop, will beat
the Big Co. to the sulphides, as a diamond-
drilling plant has been obtained from the
Government, and is to be used straight away
to test the ground between 400 ft. and
55Cft.. The future of the field as a big
producer depends on the grade and composi-
tion of the sulphides ; but when one considers
the purity of the ore down to where water
was first struck, there is practically no doubt
that galena will be the mainstay of the sul-
phides, with blende possibly a nuisance but
much more likely an asset. The latest work
on the Out-on-ller-Own indicates a very big-
body of leached ore there, and values to
water-level except for bands of bagging ore
will be on the low side. It looks to have
great possibilities, once the primary ore is
reached. The Ibus is for its size now becom-
ing recognised as one of the prize blocks on
the field. The co. is bagging ore freely at
present, the stuff averaging 51 p.c. lead and
350 z. silver. Roughly, this means a gross
value of £22 a ton, the returns to the co.
panning out at about £l4 10s. As the leases
are surrounded by the Mt. Isa ground
the results of the bores put down will in-
fluence the market for the shares in that co.
The Longreach town bore has been under ex-
amination by Queensland Mines Department,
officials owing to the strong outflow of water
from 2700 ft. carrying oil and gas with a
decidedly petroliferous odor. The oil is a
dark scum, and sufficient is coming up to
enable a few buckets to be skimmed off each
day. The skimmings coagulate into a firm,
dark-colored wax, which is probably a residual
product of an asplialtic-base oil. Samples of
the gas have been sent to Brisbane. It will
probably turn out to be a wet gas similar
to that from Roma. It is by far the most
abundant evidence of a heavy oil yet obtained
in Queensland. Until the water is shut off,
if that is possible, or another dry bore put
down, it will be impossible to say what
quantities of oil or gas exist. The fact that
the oil solidifies as soon as it loses its tem-
perature is clear evidence that the volatile
constituents, such as gasoline, which are
the most commercially valuable in any oil,
have been already dissipated. Thus it looks
as if a commercial oil find has not been made.
But what it perhaps signifies in conjunction
with Roma evidence and other bores is the
existence of tremendous gas fields of commer-
cial quality in this sedimentary strata in
Western Queensland. In fact, the Long-
reach bore rather indicates another link in
the chain of evidence which has made several
oil specialists in the past diagnose West
Queensland prospects as indicating a “has-
been” oilfield. Of those who formed this
opinion Cunningham Craig may be cited as
the most distinguished.
Since Chillagoe State Smelters restarted
oprations on January 12 about 600 tons of
silver-lead bullion has been produced. At
the present price of lead the State should
do well, as most of the ore was purchased
last year at prices ranging from £2B to £33
a ton. Silver-lead mining is booming in
North Queensland, and while there has been
no outstanding discovery, with the exception
of the Nightflower, near Chillagoe, a large
number of lodes have been opened out on
various fields, including the Etheridge, which
may turn out a mine or two later on.

Shareholders in Mt. Tumblong Develop-
ment Co. (N.S.W.) were not long in decid-
ing to close on an offer of N.T. options at
Tanami and Katherine River, the former gold
and the latter silver-lead. Chairman Henry
Barraclough was strongly influenced by a
report from Dr. H. I. Jensen. Originally
Tumblong was in 32,000 shares of 2s. 6d.
each. An additional 60,000 paid to 2s. 6d.
are being issued, and 8000 held in reserve.
The re-arrangement lifts capital to £12,500 in
100,000 shares. The name will be changed
to Northern Territory Minerals, N.L.
* * * *
Chairman A. A. Duncan, of South Luck-
now (N.S.W|.)., tells shareholders that
£13,000 has been expended in four years in a
fruitless search for bonanzas. The necessary
geological conditions had to be sought beneath
a thick mask of basalt, necessitating a large
amount of essential dead work. In round-
ing off his remarks, Duncan assures share-
holders that “all conditions, save one, com-
mon to the famous Lucknow, now exist.
That one is the gold bonanzas.” The ab-
sence of the only thing that counts is not
stressed ; instead, the chairman switches off
to plead for promptly-paid calls, in the hopo
that the missing bonanzas may be found.

The Occidental, Cobar (N.S.W.), may
have another trial if the debenture-holders
can screw up their own courage, or use their
persuasive powers to get £20,000 from some-
body else. Last October, on the initiative of
Jimmy Negus, of Mt. Boppy, the debenture-
holders appointed G. 11. Blakemorc, It. C.
Dixson, F. O. Furner and J. Negus a com-
mittee to devise ways and means of rescuing
the mine from the receiver. About £4OOO
was subscribed at the meeting, and a working
scheme for punching the shaft down another
100 ft. below the 750 ft. level approved.
According to Negus, the extra 100 ft. would
open up enough ore to add 100,000 tons to
the 113,000 tons of lOdwt. stuff already esti-
mated as being above the 740 ft. level. The
old hotch-potch plant will, of course, have to
be replaced by something more modern, the
Occidental ores being more and more refrac-
tory the deeper you get. The old co. was in
841)00 £1 shares; but its successor, the Con-
solidated, always swam in a sea of financial
difficulties. The present effort to get on a
working basis looks like the final.
The resurrected Peak Mines, Cobar
(N.S.W.), have not exposed any values in
the drives at 226 ft. and 150 ft. Stoping on
the west lode off No. 1 winze at the 100 ft.
level promises something better. In order
to connect with the rise 98ft. north from the
226 ft. level, the lower bench of the stope was
carried north for 14ft. in ore assaying lldwt.
gold and 240 z. silver over 24 inches. Later
firings disclosed a further 2ft. of ore to the
west of that stoped, and a sample of this
showed Sdwt. gold and 150 oz. silver. This
locality is beneath the slide which cut off
the ore stoped by the Brown Lode Co.
* * * *
The directors of Crown (N.S.W.) have
agreed to follow Cundy’s recommendations.
“The work so far carried out, though badly
directed in places, shows,” he says, “that
the property fully warrants further investi-
gation.” But “it is advisable to follow
the gold-bearing portions of the reefs as
closely as possible.” Candy observes that
“further prospecting work is necessary in
the upper tunnel of the south workings.
Should a favorable development occur the
ore to be stored in a convenient place.”
Meantime the 10-head battery will operate
only one shift and the electrical pump and
other gear will be put in order. In conclu-
sion Cundy gives the property “a reasonable
possibility of becoming payable” as the reef
channel “is a fairly large one, and seeing
that there is a little gold at almost every
point, it will be remarkable if a payable
shoot is not met somewhere within the
300 ft. separating the north and south work-
ings.” It is all a sorry anti-climax for a
show whose administrators handled more cash
than any other modern N.S.W. gold float, and
whose shareholders were buoyed up by bulle-
tins ridiculous in the light of this latest ver-
dict.
Tingha Tin Co. (N.S.W.) still falls far
short of the 20.000 yards a month which its
directorate aimed at. For January 10,500
yards returned seven tons oxide, compared
until the previous clean-up for 5J tons from
"700 yards. The result was more satisfac-
tory, however, as the 10,500 yards w 7 ere
treated in 365 hours, whereas the 7700 yards
had occupied 411 hours.
Jim Mackay’s followers have put in 506 ft.
of development work at New Loch F'yne
(Vic.). The rainy season kept the lower
level waterlogged, and so the value of the
gold got for six months was only £309. This
with the drain of calls has proved sufficient
for the less hopeful. Now, working south on
the fault at No. 1 level, a run of stone has
been followed 150 ft. At present it averages
only 15in., but north-west another make is
giving pay dirt, and the battery can be kept
going until it can be seen if the floor thick-
ens with depth. The search for the 4ft. of
stone bored through by the diamond drill has
only resulted in the striking of a 2ft. vein ;
still, as the working face is away to the west,
there is no need for despair—most of the
shoots in the dyke thin out in this direction.
Manager Coldham holds that the outlook is
better to-day than when John Friell cut his
rich vein which caught the market on a
bear move, so Mackay’s office hopes for big
things.

Australians seem to have acquired the
habit of being handy when any bones dating
from the “dim, red dawn of man” are dug
up in Africa. The dictum of the Queens-
lander, Professor Dart, of the Witwaters-
rand University, on the “missing-link” skull
found at Taungs, in Becliuanaland, went all
over the world last week. It was another
Australian, A. S. Armstrong, chief metallur-
gist at the Broken Hill mine in Rhodesia,
who saved for science, the almost-equally
primitive skull that the Kaffir miners un-
earthed at a depth of 60ft. from the surface
and amongst a vast deposit of mixed bones.
The relic was short of the lower jawbone,
and an adjacent shinbone was cuddling up
to the bones of a lion. Not far off were
some very rough palaeolithic stone imple-
ments.
Papua lost a zealous servant when
Evan Stanley died at Adelaide. Ap-
pointed Government Geologist of Papua
early in 1911, he performed valuable work
in the petroleum areas, and his book, “The
Geology of Papua,” embraces, in addition to
his own valuable investigations, the whole
geological story, from the advent of Beete-
Jukes, the naturalist and geologist who
accompanied the early survey party in
IT.M.S. Fly. An Adelaide Uni. and School
of Mines student, Stanley has left behind
him a fine record of scientific research.

GIBLIN, Tas-

“Spare Corp”: There are disadvantages in
being a Labor candidate known to be com-
fortably off in an electorate like Fitzroy
(Vic.). Maurice Blackburn’s office doormat
has been worn thin by the feet of “hums,”
one of them a dissipated weed in a wonder-
fully dilapidated coat and vest. His yarn
was that, being a resident of Fitzroy, he
had heard Blackburn being slandered, and
had promptly peeled off and “hogged in.”
But when, having avenged Labor’s elect, he
looked for his upper clothing, he discovered
that some emissary of Capitalism had de-
parted with it, leaving the dilapidated rai-
ment in its place. Hence the suggestion that
the man whose honor he had guarded might
have a coat and vest to give away.
Passed over at 88, in Nukualofa, Tonga,
the Rev. J. B. Watkin, one of the most
romantic figures in the Pacific Islands.
Founder of the Free Church of Tonga, Wat-
kin was revered throughout the Friendlies,
and not so many years ago his church people
prostrated themselves whenever he appeared
in the streets. He ruled with an iron hand,
and in his declining years found it hard to
be overborne by younger men whose opinions
were more modern than his own. He was
adviser in turn to both kings of Tonga, and
was credited with being the real power behind
the throne.
Probably the quaintest announcement of
an alteration in a political situation was that
of Holman when, with his party only one
to the good, he told the N.S.W. House that
the Government’s majority had fallen over
the banisters. .Tack Meehan, who was the
hero of that exploit, has only just abandoned
the crutches he was forced to use as a result
of the accident. He lost his seat in N.S.W.
Assembly subsequently; but he is now doing
very well as secretary of the Victorian-
Riverina branch of the A.W.U. Meehan has
a quick, whimsical wit. When the Speaker
whom the Laborites had borrowed from their
opponents’ ranks put the Parliamentary at-
tendants into uniforms of gorgeous coloring,
it was Meehan who gravely arose and drew
attention to the presence of rosellas in the
chamber.
Passed his last memory test, Harry Aaron-
son, North Queensland's human Blue Book.
A sporting enthusiast, he revelled in horse-
racing, and his wonderfully retentive brain
was a vast store of Australian racing data.
In the boom days of Charters Towers foot-
running, th(> sporting tailor did the handi-
capping. A keen critic of Queensland form,
Aaronson dearly
loved an argument
with the handicap-
pers of the north-
ern jockey clubs,
and on one occa-
sion, much to the
discomfiture of
visiting bookmak-
ers, he did the han-
dicapping for a

meeting at Hugh-
enden. All but one

Peter Wliitington, 80 last week, is still
chairman of Commissioners of Charities in
South Aus., though he had to leave off being
Chief Commissioner of Audit 13 years back.
He is one of a remarkable brotherhood, of

education expert, an archdeacon in Hobart
and secretary to S.A. Jockey Club. Ernest

An intrepid horseman in his young days,
Father O’Donnell, wliq died near Sydney last
week, had done more kangaroo-hunting than
any other soggarth in the world. When he
became too old to indulge in horseback esca-
pades he took to the sulky, and he could be
met any old time on the dusty roads out from
Parkes to Trundle, Bogan Gate, Peak Hill,
Condobolin and the country in between. His
pet vice then was draughts, and his first
greeting to the swagman encountered with
“the curse” up was “Good-day, me mahn!
What’s your name?” After which liis
rivirince would hit him with “Can ye play
draughts? Ye can, eh? Well, come on an’
I’ll give ye once round.” And out of his tail-
pocket would come a dilapidated board and
a set of men. A couple of shillings and all
the tobacco he had on him generally found
its way into the nomad’s pocket, and with a
“Good luck to ye” he would pass on about
his business.
“To Po” : J. H. Betheras leaves the Chief
Inspector’s chair of the Vic. Education De-
partment to do organising work for his
church. He was a popular head with all
save young teachers who “couldn’t stand the
country with its absence of sassiety.”
“Haven’t you got a fishing-rod, gun and
horse? Can’t you run a debating society for
the young chaps? Why don’t you study?”
the big Cornishman, full of vitality, would
bark, and a young-old ped. would vanish hur-
riedly to gnash his teeth in the corridor
and say “Hog!” But the same Betheras was
a very satisfying chief when there was a
real case of hardship or when a young girl-
teacher from Outback stood on the carpet.
He will be missed.

master, who has retired from the head of
Yarra Park School after close on a half-
century’s active service, was in a round-
about way the means of saving many lives
when fhe Kelly gang was out. Teaching in
the nor’-east, he dropped into Tom Curnow’s
school one night to find his brother teacher
in ill-health, and vainly struggling with the
monthly departmental returns, preparatory
to starting off in a couple of days for Mel-
bourne and a doctor. Prevailing on the sick
man to close school and go next day, Wed-
dell good-heartedly bundled up the records
and rode off with them. It was on his jour-
ney to Melbourne that Curnow got mixed
up with the Glenrowan affair, and it was he
who saved the police train from plunging
into the trap laid for it by the bushrangers.
T. R. Andrews, one-time secretary of the Mel-
bourne Hospital, passed out a few days ago.
lie held the position for 20 years, finishing
in 1917. Originally a schoolmaster, he did
In's life’s best work for the hospital, and only
ill-health compelled his resignation. His
white hair and limp recalled the central
figure in one of Boothlpy's novels.
There has been a stirring in the armchairs
and inglenooks of remote places in Maoriland
in quest of the oldest-born inhabitant. After
scores of claims had been examined the honor
for the males was found to rest with Mr.
Kennard, of Waimate, who was born at
Waikouaiti SB* years ago. and is said to
look more like 60. Two women, however,
hold the palm. Mrs. Bedggood, of the Bay
of Islands, is over 90, and Mrs. Kemp is 87.
Both were born into Samuel Marsden’s mis-
sionary party.
Richard Davis, just dead at Rocky Springs
station, near Townsville, was a member of
the brigade which took a field-gun from Mel-
bourne to Ballarat to attack the Eureka
Stockade rioters. In IS6O he assisted O’Hara
Burke to collect the necessary horses for the
Burke and Wills expedition.
“T.P.”: Canon Bevan, after a quarter-
century’s service in St. Matthew’s, Albury,
wasn’t allowed to retire to richly-earned rest
till the public of all denominations' and of none
had presented him with a wallet of 600 notes.
Albury remembers the big-hearted cleric’s
self-denying and successful war-work. When
finally the word was flashed across for Albury
to chant the Te Deum over the collapse of
the Hun, the Canon was in his church. He
stripped off his surplice, clapped a choir-
girl’s trencher on his head (back to front) in
mistake for his hat, bolted off with flapping
cassock, and. mounting a cart, gave to a
cheering public the leading speech of the cele-
brations. All sorts and conditions of people
in Riverina will miss a grand old man.
Dr. D. S. Adam, who died suddenly last
week whilst touring China, was one of the
pillars of the Kirk in Victoria. He was the
leader of the section which desires union
with the Methodist and Congregational
Churches, but was no match in debate for
his experienced opponent, Larry Rentoul,
who led to victory tlie forces opposed to any
interference with the rights of Kirk members.
Yic. Governor Stradbroke told the A.N.A.
on Foundation Day that he had been given
to understand that before a man could be
regarded as a good Australian he had to
kill a snake. In the presence of six fellow
Cabineteers the other day, Col. Bourchier,
Tic. Minister for Agriculture, who had
already won a colonelcy, D. 5.0.. C.M.G.,
and the rest for his part in the Big Scrap
in Palestine, secured this necessary qualifi-
cation. The occasion was a little Ministerial
.launt to see the mountains, the scene
was Whisky Flat, and it was the morning
after a night in a hut on Mount Hotham,
with the floor, leaves and rugs for beds. When
a 4ft. 6in. brown snake rose up to bar the
way the leaps which the Libs, and Cockies
o- the Cabinet took exceeded anything done
by them since they left school—all but
Bourchier, who reached out for a stick, and
with one whack made himself a good Aus-
tralian. The two chauffeurs have since
given the nine Ministers a certificate that it
was a real snake and not an illusion of
Whisky Flat.
Rev. Thomas Piper, who resides with his
son, A. W. Piper, K.C., at Fullarton, Adel-
aide, had his 90th birthday on Feb. 5. He
is said to be. the senior iNlethodist minister
m Australasia; he spent 67 years in the
work.
Maoriland lost its heaviest native-born
woman recently when Bella. Mataroa died
at South Auckland. She was not quite
80 and weighed B2st. 41b.—five of her
would have made well over a ton. Her bulk
was sufficient to prevent her getting through
a railway-carriage door, and when she be-
came ill and it was necessary to remove her
for medical attendance a powerful draught
horse was secured from another district to
move the vehicle.
If L. C. E. Gee has not put up a record
run as a civil servant he has got very close
to it. He entered the public service of South
A »s- ™ September 18. 1870. and has retired
after 54 years at the grindstone. As warden
and special magistrate, he administered Tar-
coola, Tanami (N.T.), Arltunga (N.T.) and
other far-back-fields in their earlier and more
woolly days. Later he settled down to a
steady job as chief registrar and recorder
of mines. Feeling too young for rest, he is
now going to do some writing.
W. G. Swift, recently retired from the
job of Council Clerk of Northcote (Vic.)
after 38 years, nursed his diocese from its
bushland babyhood
to its present
crowded suburban
adolescence. When
he first arrived a
' two-liorse ’bus was
the only means of
regular passenger
traffic with Mel-
bourne. and that
stopped running
because the patron-
age wasn't suffi-
cient to make it
pay. After that a
cable service was
owned by a
co., but went under
in the bank crisis.
The Council sub-
sequently ran the
affair for 14 years,
and then sold to its
big neighbor.

“.Tesmond”: Colonel Strangman deserves
credit for other work besides his system of
tropical hygiene (B. 29/l/’25). A few
years ago he was the outstanding authority
in the Commonwealth on “re-education,” and
some of his cures during his tour of the mili-
tary hospitals were so wonderful that they
rival the subsequent successes of Hickson.
Cripples were taught to move about with
comparative freedom, and hopeless cases
shown how to make the most of the few
powers left them. The Colonel had such
a sympathetic understanding of one’s diffi-
culties that a man could not fail to have
full confidence in his power to help, G'ke
most successful doctors he had an utter dis-
regard of personal appearances, and it was
amusing to see half a dozen sleek M.O. s
trailing him through the smoke-screen from
his ancient briar.
Sir James Mackenzie, the famous Scot-
tish physician whose death is reported, was
once known as “Immoral” Mackenzie
through no fault of his own. When the Ger-
man Emperor Frederick, father of the ex-
Kaiser, was dying from cancer of the throat,
another physician Mackenzie was one of his
doctors, and was brought into great promi-
nence by the furious campaign which the
jealous German medicoes directed against him.
His front name was Morell, and to distin-
guish the two the just-deceased Mackenzie
was given his unflattering nickname.
Mrs. Henry Jones, widow of an old S.
Aus. squatter, long since dead, who with his
brother founded Binnum station, near Nara-
coorte, in the forties of last century, resides
in England, in her 95th year. She wrote
an interesting book published in London in
187 S entitled “Broad Outlines of Long Years
in Australia.” Mrs. Brewer, a daughter, re-
sides in Sydney. A son, 001. Caton Jones,
C. 8., served as a medical officer in the Egyp-
tian, Boer and Great wars; another, the late
Goring Jones, rose in the European war to
Brig.-General, and afterwards held the
Quetta command.

But why condemn in terror,

’Tis an inborn, expected,
Characteristic fault,
Quite easily detected,
Like saltiness in salt.
Yet cna can have at times too much:
Once Europe was ablaze
Because Napoleon had such
Napoleonic ways.
An ego too excessive
Has been the onion’s bane;
A spirit too aggressive
Made Hector’s virtues vain ;
And vigor unavailing
Could not the scale depress
’Gainst Trotsky’s horrid failing
Of too much Trotskiness.

How a Car forged its way o’er rock and gully, through swamp
and bush and river, in triumph to the top of Carey’s Peak—with
Gelignite to blast the track and C.O.R. Motor Spirit providing
the driving force.
NEVER before has such a hare-brained feat of motoring recklessness been attempted—yet it succeeded. Out from
Newcastle there towers into the sky Carey’s Peak, a full 5400 feet above sea-level, trackless and bush-clad
almost to the very summit. And the other day Fred Withers drove—or rather—rammed—an Essex Six right
to the top.
Forty-odd creeks and streams had to be forded, rocks and
logs blasted out of the way, swamps negotiated, and the
car had to charge its way through scrub and fern and the
lighter bush. Yet she won out!
Hills almost vertical; stumps and hummocks every-
where; no semblance of a track for miles—lurching and
bumping its dizzy way, the car came through!
How was it done?
There were three factors—the courageous determination of
the man, the sturdy efficiency of the car—and the abundant
POWER released by every drop of C.O.R. Motor Spirit.
For Fred Withers knew well that his own safety as well
as the success of his desperate enterprise deoended on the
Motor Spirit—and that is why he used C.O.R. exclusively.

“Up North”: “Cartot” (B. 8/l/’25) re-
fers to half-castes as being clever at school. Quite
right. In N.Q. the mixed breed are also smart,
and continue so up to about 23. Their ability to
learn practically anything is astonishing. They are
fine horsemen, can drive motor-boats, and often
speak bits of several languages. Then comes the
call of the blood. They quickly lose all the virtues
of the white man, and pick up his worst vices with
the ease with which before they picked up his good
points. They become shiftless, and are never to be
depended upon. Finally' comes the eclipse, when
they slip back and “mix it” with the aboriginals.
It is a strange fact, too, that at about 23 their
skin becomes much darker.
“Curlew”: “Jimmy Possum”
asks the origin of the term “gun
eaneeutter” (B. 15/l/’25). Every
shining light in a caUing of any
sort is a “big gun” ; and by abbre-
viation we hear of gun shearers or
drovers. I have heard general man-
agers spoken of as the gun, the
“big” being understood; and I
heard soldiers after the S’African
War expressing the opinion that
French was the gun over there.
Some others for uniniated Abos. to
append to their dictionaries; A
lizard is a boundary rider, from his
habit of crawling along fences; a
frill-lizard is a station oVerseer,
from his assuming (thougli not in-
variably) superior clothing and man-
ners ; a blue-tongue is a station
manager, from the usual color of
his remarks when addressing com-
mon lizards; a. sleeping-lizard or
shingle-back is a non-working
owner. I have never heard saurian
synonyms applied to other station
employees, but in the old days the
bank manager might appropriately
have been the alligator. Forty years
age one of the main attractions at
most bush social gatherings was a
shooting gallery and the “shilleny
pools” in connection therewith. A
c onsistent winner was spoken of as
“ringing the bell” nearly every
time (i.e., getting bull’s-eyes). The
expression spread to ordinary occu-
pations, in which any element of
contest was possible; and as there
was always a contest among the
fastest men to shear the largest
number of sheep during a shearing,
the winner was at first said to ring
the bell at a certain shed. Of
course he soon became simply “the
ringer.”
“Cartot”: There is another “gun” in the argot ot
Australia, meaning thief or confidence man, but the
derivation of this word has no connection with the
other; it is from the Yiddish “goniff,” shortened
colloquially to “gon,” meaning robber.
“Munjong” : I nominate the native porcu-
pine as champion weightlifter for his size. Yesterday
I found one under a stack of wheat in the paddock,
and, wishing to take him home to show to the
nippers, put him in the tucker-box an 1 dumped a
bag of wheat on the lid. On returning to get him
I found the bag of wheat on the ground and his
nibs under some straw close by. After he had given
me an exhibition to prove it was dinkum, I
reckoned he had earned his freedom. The bags in
this heap averaged 1951 b.
“W.J.C.”: “Nitric” (B. 18/12/’24) talks
of cross-pollination between pawpaw and banana at
Nambour. I have seen the same thing at the Barron
Falls (N.Q.), but the sinister offspring were not
all bananas. One fruit gave the true shape, ridges
and segmentation of a crown pumpkin ; another grew
long reptilesque appendages from the shoulder, each
STUMPY EXPRESSES AN OPINION.
BOSS: “A botfly must have tackled old Stumpy.”
JACKY : “Baal botfly, Boss. Stumpy bin sec that noochum phclla gettin’ in longa trap.”
of them terminating in a bump very like the head
of a bull eel. And I have hooked bull eels and
often found them carrying bubuncles not unlike
pawpaws; therefore must “Nitric” extend his theory
and admit mutual cross-fertilisation to the argument.
But I submit the whole thing to be mere chance
deformity, and suggest over-fertile soil and over-
heavy crops as joint causes. If “Nitric” examines
his trees at Nambour next year he will find fewer
fruit and probably no misshapen ones. He might
as well try to cross an iguanodon and a periwinkle as
a banana and a pawpaw.
* * * *
“Benroy”: Neither “Tarago” (B.
15/l/’25) nor “Bill Brown” has much to crow
over in the operation on the pet parrot. In my
poultry yard I have never had less than 750 birds
(W.L. and B.O.), and a .year seldom passes without
at. least a dozen cases of crop impaction, as it is
called. The stoppage is more often than not caused
I)3’ long fibre, usually due to a shortage of chaffed
green feed and the bird eating dry and fibrous stalks.
Cut a few feathers away, make a short incision witn
a razor through both the inner skin of the crop
and the outer skin, then clean out and rinse the
crop and sew up. See that the inner and the outer
skins are sewn separately, and keep Biddy on a
soft diet for a couple of day's. Thus acting, I have
never lost a bird yet, and have successfully operated
on turkeys, parrots and cockatoos as well as chooks.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale”: E. Gazzard, of Cleegate,
near Orange (N.S.W.), has a merino ewe which has
been a small Mt. Morgan to him. She is 29 years
old and yields an average of 9lb. of first-class wool
every shearing. And she isn’t a one-metal mine
either; her owner has had some high-class rams
from her.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “Keppel” seeks a remedy for
nut grass (B. lf>/l/’25). There arc two, and if
you try the wrong one you will have a funeral before
the cure is complete. That remedy is to dig it up,
roots, nuts and all. Since the roots delve down to
30 feet or more, better try the second method. The
cochineal insect, which is now bred to destroy Banana-
land prickly-pear, will remove nut grass. The insect
devours the leaves, and finally so affects the nuts
as to make them incapable of reproduction. Pear
farmers can obtain the insect on demand, so there
should be no difficulty about getting supplies.
“Moe”: “Munjong” is quite right in his
assertion that the crocodile makes a noise which
varies from a croak to a bellow (B. 15/l/’25) ; but
I think it does so at other times than when it is
fighting or mating. At Morobe, in the Mandated
Territory, one could sit on the verandah of the
hospital bungalow and listen to the crocs, around
the entrance to the lagoon or the mouth of the
creek, making the night hideous with their roars.
I have heard one old male making a noise exactly
like that of a bull, which could be heard at least
three-quarters of a mile. Many believe that it is
only the male which can make this call, but natives
say the female is a Melba too. Probably the female
sings only at mating-time, while the male bellows
at all times.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: Many adobe houses fail to
stand because the builder orriits a dampeourse. if
you want permanent walls, build them of 18in. x
9in. x 6in. blocks, rammed into wooden moulds and
allowed to partly dry in the shade. Lay a founda-
tion of these blocks 18in. high, and then spread
a dampeourse of well-tarred sand before building
higher. The walls will then stand indefinitely ; if this
necessary' precaution is not taken they are likely
to gradually crumble away, through the magnesia-
laden moisture from the soil creeping up, and causing
the material to disintegrate.
“Sey Le” : Re the fox that dropped its
bundle and allowed a lad to carry' it home in a
rabbit-trap. Here (Richmond River), about four
years ago, when foxes were a novelt.v in the district,
we heard a commotion in the next paddock. Investi-
gation showed that a fox had been located in a
log by some blacks and their dogs, all greatly
excited. The log was tapped for the hollowest place,
and an opening was chopped directly over Reynard.
His brush was grabbed and he was drawn out
until lie could be gripped by the scruff close to the
ears. He proved to be a full-grown dog-fox, and
appeared to be sulky. After examination he was
carried a distance of over four miles to the camp
and chained up, all without a kick or even a snarl.
Yet a harmless, timid hare held for two minutes
in the same position would have ripped clothes and
man to ribbons.
* * * *
“O. Possum” : “Gouger’s” York Peninsula
bushmen (B. 15/l/’25) might avoid cuts on their
horses’ legs if they adopted a device mentioned in
a Zane Grey novel. The hero is credited with having
put guards on the front legs of his mount when
riding through the cactus in the s.-w. of the States.
Can’t we learn something from the cowboy besides
the use of a gluepot saddle?
* * * ♦
“Centre”: Will the Council settle an
argument I’ve landed myself into over the kangaroo’s
and wallaby’s method of giving the “thump signals”
referred to by “Lily-Beale” (B. 18/12/’24), who
says they “morse” with their tails. I’ve always under-
stood the thud-thud was made with a stamp of
the hind leg, after the manner of the hare and rabbit.
I’ve seen the Too stamp in this manner repeatedly.
Yet my cobber insists that “Lily-Beale” is right.
Is he?
A PARAGON.
PROUD MOTHER: “Wot! Never met my
Willy? Oh, ’e’s a gen'leman, ’e is. Why,
when ’e was at Long Bay ’e got two
munce took off ’is sentence on account
of ’is luffly manners.”
“Nugget” : A cocky up here told me the
semi-mongrel at his heels was “'the best hand he
ever see at breakin’ in her own pups.” Said she
took them with her after the cows as soon as they
reached weeks of discretion, and never obeyed the
order to “come behind” or “go ahead” without first
collecting the family and taking them along. if
one of the youngsters ran in among the milkers or
committed a similar offence, she would immediately
knock him over and clout his ears with her forepaws.
Several of the neighbors gave corroborative evidence;
and all took beer. Has any of the Council ever
owned a similar dog?
(Continued on page 2-}.)
A RECORD THIRST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“You talk about a thirst!” he said—a rather worn
remark
That leads to reminiscences along the Ironbark ;
And this cove sank his pint of beer with emphasis
that told
That lie would stay and have his say though Hell
itself turned cold.
“You talk about a thirst!” he said. We hadn’t;
still, he knew
We should have talked about a thirst out there In
Windaloo.
And then he shook his moulted head and drank an-
other pot,
While from his lips he licked the drips his early
thirst forgot.
He’d been, he said, in ’eighty-four, prospecting down
the creek
That sometimes drains the wowser’s drink from
Wirrabill.v Peak.
Ilis mate was one Ern Kessey, and the stuff they
sought was gold—
A simple quest that gives the West a lot of bones
to hold.
Three months or more they carried on before the
flaming drought
Came down from Wirrabill.v Peak and simply starved
them out.
The stuff they’d had to drink was gone, together with
their grub ;
They had to pick and do it quick—they headed for
a pub.
The nearest one was forty miles across the Brickdust
Plain;
They’d covered thirty-nine of it when —here he
writhed in pain—
The Brickdust Plain cracked right across as far as
they could see,
A gaping crack across the track as wide as memory.
NO EDEN WITHOUT ITS SNAKE.
“I suppose you can get as much as you want now you
work at the brewery!”
“No such luck! Only as much as I can carry.”
Three days they walked it up and down, without a
taste to drink,
And gazed in anguish at the pub one mile beyond
the brink.
Their tongues swelled up as if they’d burst, their
lips grew cracked as well;
Their gullets ached with thirst unslaked; it was a
Christian Hell!
The old cove trembled as he told how, nearly dead
with thirst,
They watched a mighty cloud arise and circle round
and burst.
It rained in lumps for half a day, a torrent thick
and black;
And when at last its wrath had passed a river filled
the crack.
They thanked the gods for mercies great, and then
they drew their breath
And swam across the yellow stream that stood ’tween
them and death.
The last long mile the narrator refused to touch upon,
But shook his head and left its dread among the
nightmares gone.
At last they breasted to the bar, worn out and
nearly dead.
Two pints were pulled, each drank his down and
nodded with his head.
A sizzling noise came from their throats, steam rose
from tongue and lip ;
They' drank it down that liquid brown and never
left a drip.
A quart, a gallon ; still they' drank, with thirst still
left unslain,
Just nodding to the publican to fill them up again.
For half a day' the pints rolled down and sizzled as
they went,
And steam arose beneath each nose to mark tne
great event.
At length the liquid had effect, their thirst fell
down and broke;
And then—the first time for a week —that mate
and cobber spoke.
“Yes, fillemupagain,” they said, in voices eased of
pain:
“we nearly died of thirst.” they cried: “We darned
near drank the rain.”

For 9 Years Leader of Fine Car Sales

Genuine Balloon Tires
Now Enhance World's Greatest Value
For more than nine years the Hudson Super-
Six has led all fine car sales. Nothing but
consistent leadership of real car value could
win and hold such owner confidence.
Today, with greater beauty of line, lower
gravity center and smoother operation, the
Hudson Super-Six also brings the luxurious
riding ease and almost doubled braking effi-
ciency of genuine balloon tires. They are
standard equipment on all models. Do not
confuse with “semi-balloon” types. Hud-
son’s are full size and genuine. Important
also, Hudson has not merely “added balloon
tires.” Both running and steering gear have
been specially designed for the radical differ-
ence balloon tires bring. The result is the
easiest steering and riding Hudson ever built.
And with these added refinements, Hudson’s
price advantage over comparable cars is
more marked than ever.
Hudson’s chief appeal has always been in
performance. By every way open to proof it
has established its supremacy. Its records
are famous. In speed, acceleration, hill-
climbing and endurance it holds marks that
are celebrated among stock cars.
The Super-Six of today, retaining all these
noted qualities, adds a greater economy of
fuel, oil and maintenance, and a service policy
of minimum cost, including astonishingly
low parts price.

The Coach is a Hudson-
Essex invention. No
other type and no other
car gives “Closed Car
Comforts at Open Car
Cost.” Everyone knows
it represents the highest
closed car value. That
is why it is the largest
selling 6-cylinder closed
car in the world.

“Akran”: A 1701 b. groper was caught off
the Wardell (N.S.W.) punt about a fortnight ago ; but
that’s only a herring compared with the monster
which anglers occasionally hook at Harwood, on
the Clarence River. He always manages to escape,
and some good lines have accompanied him back
to his home. One fisherman who had him in tow for
a while reckoned he had whiskers, and a lot more
were ready to swear the same thing when he
came up on the end of a line for a peep. Whiskers
certainly were protruding from his huge jaws, but
the} 7 were nothing more than a tangle of lines that
the veteran had snapped. His luck was right in
last time, as only for a bolt breaking his number
was up. Local anglers reckon he is somewhere about
7001 b.
* * * *
“Gouger” : “Mako” (B. 8/l/’25) refers to
the glow-worms in the King Country caves (M.L.).
In some old mine workings in the Coramba district
(N.S.W.) I’ve gazed from a tunnel up an abandoned
shaft at night time, and it was like looking at
the far-away sky through a tube of beautiful green
light. In this case a billion diamonds scintillated
amidst the green. They were dewdrops caught
upon the tiny webs which the insects spin. In the
myriad depressions of the black rock there are
little half-inch threads of life flaunting a miniature
bulb of blue-green behind a gossamer veil. Strike
the rock walls with the pick, and only the stars
shine down. But presently pinheads of green dot
the shaft walls far up towards the sky; and soon
the whole shaft glows again.
CELESTIAL CHIMES.
“Co in der shop and play mit der cash-register, dere's a
goot hoy, Izzy—l like to ’ear der music of der hells
on Sunday morning.”
“Herodot” : A grazier of my acquaintance
has his own way of catching wily horses. His plan
is to sprinkle on loaf-sugar a few drops of oil
of rhodium, which exercises a strange attraction for
all kinds of animals, horses especially. Recently
I witnessed the harnessing in this manner of an old
station mare which had long held the reputation of
being one of the most artful dodgers on the place.
When the sugar with the oil on it was held towards
her, she first sniffed cautiously, then came right up
to the man who held it and allowed herself to be
caught. The oil can be obtained at practically any
chemist’s shop.
“Dry”: Scott and I were camped together.
The night was frosty. Scott was a big man with
large feet —how large let Scott tell. He slept on
his back, feet to the fire. Towards morning the
fire had dwindled down to a few coals. The cold
had made Scott pull the blankets up over his head,
exposing his southern extremities. Something woke
him. Looking towards the fire he saw two objects.
ANOTHER CASE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION.
“I have to conduct the funeral of a Mr. Simpson somewhere in the
neighborhood. Could you direct me to his residence?”
“Lor ' Hess yer, yes. He is living, poor man, in the second house
in that row.”
The next I heard was a roar and Scott was nursing
his toes. “Cripes!” he said. “I thought they was
two goats, and I chucked my boots to drive them
away from the fire.”
* * * *
“Sax”: A returned soldier, taking on a
selection, was unwise enough to select granite for
his fireplace and hobs. Piling on the wood, he
suddenly thought he was in France again, as there
were repeated explosions and flying fragments of
stone everywhere. He has now learned, both by
precept and practice, that granite explodes under
great heat, and should never be used for fireplaces,
bush or otherwise.
* * * *
“AdeL”: In parts of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, after three years of low rainfall, many
lagocn; have dried up which were
regarded as permanent. In their
waters perch, cod, jewfish and
catfish, turtles and crocodiles were
in great numbers. What happened
to them when the last drop of
fluid evaporated? Crocodiles and
turtles made for pastures new, and
travelled as much as 16 miles over
dry country to another hole. The
cod, burying themselves in the
mud, awaited the seasonable rains,
which this year came early ; many
of them thus survived the drought.
Ducks, pelicans, cormorants and
other waterfowl, so plentiful in
these lagoons, had all abandoned
the localities months before they
dried up. What gorgeous feeds
the birds missed! Does the Coun-
cil know of fish other than cod
which have learned the frog's
trie kof burying in the mud ? The
Gulf blacks made great catches in
these lagoons before and after
they dried up. Hollow logs, one
end securely blocked with w r eeds,
were thrown in, and as the water
slowly retired fish sought cover in
the logs. These latter were then
gently pulled out. When the last
water had evaporated, long barbed
spears were brought in use to fork
the mud, and the cod were impaled. Binghi is
a great angler.
* * * *
“K.”: The inflammable shrub with a small
white flower mentioned by “Stooks” (B. 8/l/’2o) is
not confined to the coastal area of Eyre’s Peninsula
(S.A.). I have found it growing 40 or 50 miles
inland, where it retains its moniker of kerosene bush.
A somewhat similar shrub, a little less glossy in
appearance and having a bluish flower, is also to
be found inland. But it lacks some of the combus-
tibility of the other.
“Trevdee”: John Cornish, of Mt. Ivoo-
yoora (Vie.), cut his lucerne crop five weeks ago.
and to-day it is standing six feet high. Record ?
* * * *
“Fitz”: The Australian black was not
lacking in courage. At Kurnell two Botany Bay
tribesmen, armed only with reed spears and wooden
lances, boomerang and nulla, stood forth and chal-
lenged Captain Cook
and his armed sailors
and marines when they
essayed to disembark
—two naked Ravages
against an armed ship’s
crew. Remember Jacky
Jaekv, fighting a lone
hand for his dying
leader —the gallant ex-
plorer Kennedy—in
the jungles of North
Queensland; or read
the records of Oxley
and Evans, Sturt and
Hume, Mitchell and
Stuart, who met the
dark man for the first
time and before the
“native Australian”
was tainted by contact
with the conquering
race. Science in the
twentieth century re-
grets, and has cause to
regret, the shameful
neglect of 100 years
ago. Never again can
stlch an opportunity
occur for primeval man
to be studied—his life
story learned, and his
connection with the
world’s races analysed.
The popular belief that
they had no language
other than oral is quite
wrong. Their sign
language, smoke-signal
code, message sticks,
carven trees and tree-
tapping tell quite a
different tale. A few
pitiful fragments of
once powerful tribes
are all that are left to
carry on the traditions.
On the Manning but
few full-blooded aborigi-
nals remain, though on
the Lower Maeleay 1
recently saw more than I had for years.
“Wai-lioi”: Rottnest Island, outside Fre-
mantle (W.A.), where Ylaming made a Christmas
call 238 years back, has something out of the
common in salt lakes, a chain of them decorating
the middle of the island. They are about 10 times
salter than the surrounding Indian Ocean, and it’s
easier to do the Sea of Gallilee act on them than
dive to any depth. If you give fancy baskets or
such like a continuous bath for a week or so, they
become encrusted with a fine lot of saline crystals.
Some of the old hands on the island used to make
a bit that way, but now that the island is over-
run with tourists, there’s a shortage of curios. 1
saw recently in an old-time drawing-room at Fre-
mantle (wherein, by the way, antimacassars held
pride of place) a fine array of crystallised odds ami
ends. If the family eat ever gets loose amongst
them there’ll be something doing.
“Phoney”: Something like 6000 finches
were taken aboard the s.s. Bambra at Wyndham, to
be sold in Perth at 2s. per head. These tiny birds,
with their vivid markings and pleasing notes, always
attract attention. An exhibit sent to Wembley was
universally admired. Caught in the back country
by means of nets, it is only a question of time, at
the present rate of capture, when they will become
extinct. The Westralian Government should place
some restriction on the traffic. In the meantime the
S.I’.C.A. might have something to say on the over-
crowding of the captives’ cages.
* * * *
“Speargrass”: We were camped beside a
desert well on the edge of Centralia; my mate was
bending towards the billy when a spear hissed from
the darkness and buried itself in the sand behind
him. We both rushed into the night, firing and
shouting, but the natives had vanished. By daylight
we examined the spear and experienced the same
pleasant thrill a prospector gets whtn he finds colors
in the dish. The barbs, instead of being jagged
quartzite, bound to the haft with tree gum and
’roo sinew, were fragments of opal showing red
and orange fire. We collected some tobacco and
a few presents, mounted and rode on the nigs’ tracks.
The reading was easy, for the broad brown book
was sand-strewn, and the writers had dotted the
pages with footprints. Five miles away we came
on some 50 bucks, gins and piccaninnies squatting
about and grinding up nardoo. The yelps of
their mongrels gave them the alarm, and the whole
mob were soon streaking towards a rough sand-
stone gully as if a thousand devils were behind them
Yelling in all the dialects we knew that we were
friends, and waving aloft sticks of tobacco as
guarantees, we galloped after them, but they had
soon disappeared among the tumbled rocks lining
the gully’s edge. All except one young gin who, by
the greatest of good luck, and thanks to my highly
skilled old prad, I managed to head off. She ran
screaming beside the horse as we galloped parallel
with the gully’s side. Just as I thought she was
going to .break between the animal’s legs into the
gully, my mate wheeled up alongside, and, reaching
down a long arm, clawed his fingers into the mop
of dried clay, ochre and goann i fat that ornamented
the damsel’s hair. Her yells redoubled, despite all
our coaxing. We showed her the spear, and she
yelled more. We showed her the tobacco and a
pocket-knife and an old shirt of my mate’s and
pledged ourselves by all the energetic sign words we
knew to endow her with all these things and more
if she’d only show us where the barbs came from.
Thereat she stopped screaming spasmodically and
became one unbroken scream. My mate lost his
temper and threatened her with a hiding. I didn i
think she could scream any louder, but she did.
We let her go at last. She went! Just a chocolate-
colored streak of legs that disappeared in an instant
among the boulders. We never found the opal field.
“Mountaineer” : Another belated entry for
the Queer Accident Stakes, or an early-door ticket
for something fresh. During a rather lively dis-
play of heavenly fireworks, a green tree, used as
the corner post of a plantation fence, situated about
a mile away from a Queensland North Coast rail-
way station, was struck. In the morning the planta-
tion owner investigated, and on the t hick white bark
found depicted for a length of about three feet, and
spreading half-way round the trunk, the delicate
outlines of fronds of fern, or the spreading branches
of some soft-foliaged scrub tree, just as though
they had been etched there with some sharp-pointed
instrument.
* » * *
“Pat Busliie”: Fishermen down Swansea
way (N.S.AV.) get some nice bream when biting is
otherwise slack by drifting the boat over against
the piles of the bridge, and attaching a small crab
to the hook and allowing it to run down the pile.
It seldom gets far into the water before a hungry
bream darts out and is dangling on the end of
the line. This method is far easier when biting
is slack than waiting around for strays, as some-
how the fish don’t take a tumble to what’s doing
until it is too late.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Dr. H. B. Pearson, who has
been conducting a hookworm investigation on the
N.S.W. North Coast, reports that up to December
examination of 9707 people showed that 245 were
Jnfected. Tweed River and Bell ingen had the
highest percentages of infection, 1.9 and 3.1 for
Tweed River this year and last, and 3.2 and 5.5
for Bellingi n for the same period. Out of 100
Binghis examined in the Bellingen district, 70
were infected. Bare feet and primitive sanitation
are the great factors in spreading the disease. Black
Brother is therefore naturally the most active dis-
tributor.
* » * *
“Clio”: Can any entomologist tell me
whether there is any likelihood of the Egyptian
scarab-beetle becoming a pest? During the war a
Light Horse trooper stationed at Aleppo sent as
a souvenir a cardboard box containing several of
the beautiful insects. They were all dead on arrival;
but there were a lot of eggs attached to the side
of the box. The latter was thrown into a clump of
bamboos, which are now literally swarming with a
brilliant array of scarab-beetles. (I live not far
from Melbourne.) By a most extraordinary co-
incidence, the clump of bamboos referred to is the
variety known as the Nile Reed.
* * * *
“Thistle”: Let me add mine to the list of
accidents that have befallen fish dynamiters. It
happened in a small tributary of the Herbert, west
of Woodleigh station (N.Q.). The season was dry,
and in a small hole were dozens of black bream.
But they wouldn’t look at the bully beef, the only
MIXED IN HIS DETAILS.

likely stuff we had. It was a fencing' party, and
the method was obvious. Into a nice shoal a
joyful stockman dropped the charge. Above the
echoes of the explosion swelled his roar and curses;
a three-pounder had hit him with such force that
it broke his nose.
AN IDYLL OF BOX TREE PLAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Said Bill, as he watched the whirlies lift
The sand off the grassless plain,
To the boss who was fighting a two-year drought:
“I’m going to bring you some rain. -
“I’m going to fetch you some moisture, boss.
Just see if my words ain’t true!
It’s a marvellous thing, if a bloke has faith,
What a praying stunt will do.”
Now it seemed that the prayers of Bill were heard,
For the rain arrived that night;
And Bill as he woke from his slumber smiled
And chuckled in sheer delight.
“It’s me that the boss will blame for this
There isn’t the slightest doubt;
I’ll be on a rise for a certainty—
I’ve broken the flamin’ drought!”
When the dawn arrived and the moisture lay
In sheets on the box-tree plain
Bill bristled with pride when he met the boss
At the tank near the two-mile lane.
“Well, what do you think of it now?” said Bill,
“There’s water in every tank;
Three inches I reckon on up to date
And it’s me that you’ve got to thank.”
But never a thank-you did Bill receive—
’Twas a curse from the boss instead;
He pointed across to a heap of bones
And these are the words he said:
“Why didn’t you work the praying stunt
When the drought had just begun?
You’ve kept me waiting till half of the sheep
Were dead on the flamin’ run!”

Mesteitt Limited's
Linseed Sheep Nuts
THE MAIN CAUSE OF
STERILITY IN RAMS AND EWES
IS MALNUTRITION.
The cheapest, easiest and best way of ensuring maximum potency in rams and fecundity
in ewes is to allow a daily ration of 2oz. per head of Meggitt Limited’s Pure Linseed Sheep Nuts
in addition to the natural pastures.
MALNUTRITION may be caused by insufficiency of food or unsuitable food.
Foods rich in sugars and starch have an adverse effect on potency, often causing fatty
degeneration of the generative organs. Hence the unsuitability of mangels, ensilage, molasses, etc.
To ensure potency and fecundity a proportion of the food must be nitrogenous in character, as
is is the protein part of food alone which supplies the needs of the generative system
Meggit Limited’s Linseed Sheep Nuts contain most protein and oil, are the most nutritious,
most highly concentrated, most easily fed, most easily transported and therefore the most
economical feed you can procure.

MISSES MONK & DOVLE
Phones Central 1532, 1533.
Hundreds of those who rushed His Majes-
ty’s box office on Saturday night were turned
ticketless away, leaving an overflowing house
to cheer “Betty” to her Melbourne premiere
and Maud Fane to her return to the stage
and Australia. The little star has regained
her first delicate slimness, and the house told
her in thunderous handclappings that she
smiles as ravishingly as ever. The gallery
girls uttered passionate cries when she dis-
carded her kitchenmaid’s cap and apron for
the bridal finery of white satin with a glitter-
ing stream of crystal beads; but even the
wedding plumage paled to insignificance
beside her final frock of rosy georgette
weighted at the hem with shaded pink ostrich
fronds. The show was a sucession of up-to-
the-minute dress thrills, and a year’s yield of
a S’African ostrich farm must have been re-
quisitioned to supply the trimmings. Betty
stepped from the tons of vegetation showered
on the players to tell the audience over a
bunch of pink roses that she intended to make
a long stay here, at which the applause
swelled furiously.
A full house showed that “Sally” had not
lost her drawing powers when she
stepped out at the Royal on Saturday night.
After the final curtain the stage* looked like
the main street of a Mediterranean village
after the annual Battle of Flowers. Josie’s
gallery-girl lovers have swelled to hundreds
since she twinkled back in “Good Morning,
Dearie”; while a row of the other sex, who
have made a habit of dropping into the stalls
two or three times a week, show that Josie’s
admirers are not confined to the goddesses.
A candid visitor lately declared that even-
ing newsboys yell more lustily and theatre-
goers chew more loudly in Melbourne than
in any other city in the Southern Hemi-
sphere ; and he would have had his view
confirmed if he had been at the resurrection
of “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” on Satur-
day night, at the King’s. The peak moment
of tragedy in the career of that lady would
have been also a tense moment if it had not
been punctuated by the crackle of caramels
being peeled and liqueur-chocolates being
crunched. Nevertheless, when the lights
blazed up after the final curtain, half the
house was found to be mopping its eyes oyer
the pathetic story; and the star actors were
called back with the fervor that is usually
shown at a first-night production.
The Vanbrugh, as Mrs. Tanqueray, was
dressy enough to have raised anybody’s sus-
picions that she had a past. A tea-gown of
pink georgette weighted with heavy lace sug-
gested a fallen angel enmeshed in a rosy
cloud; but a later white satin heavily en-
crusted with crystal and silver was far too
frivolous for the final tragedy.
The Melbourne Repertory Play Society
sheltered its annual meeting in the Indepen-
uent llall, but with its usual modesty failed
to moke a loud noise about it. It is by
their large and flapping ears that playgoers
must be led, and the society needs to realise
the necessity of advertisement. Surgeon
George Syme spoke of future plans
ally of the society’s hopes of increasing its
membership on an annual subscription of
one guinea. Professors Wallace, Archie
Strong and Berry, Rose Quong, Miss Gilman
Jones and T. G. Olipliant, the original coin-
mittee of the Mermaid Play Society, were
elected hon. members of the reformed Reper-
tory. The Playhouse, when it is over-
hauled, is to be rechristened Prince of Wales
Theatre; which shows that somebody in
charge knows the value of a popular appeal.
Portia Geacli, president of the Housewives’
Association in Sydney and live-wire in the
matter of Food Reform, blew in the other
day for a chat with her Melbourne friends
before stemming off for a few weeks under
the Stars and Stripes in the important capa-
city of Australian representative at a
Women’s National Congress. Nearly as keen
on the grub question as Portia herself,
dental-doctor Payne-Philpots and his. wife
cheered her on with a Vitamine Tea in the
Keswick Cafe. Most of those present were
presidents or secretaries of women’s activi-
ties, and know almost as much about vita-
mines as they do about hats; but the unini-
tiated were disappointed on being introduced
to the same old cake and sandwich; and the
assurance that, being whole-meal, the food
was stuffed with vitamines didn’t half con-
sole them. The star guest, in telling the
gathering what and what not to eat. advised
housewives to cut down the butcher’s orders
and put into the milk billy the coppers they
saved on chops. Sugar should be relished
as a luxury; and the great Clapp slogan,
"Eat More Fruit,” was sound hygiene as well
as good business for Australia. . Dr. 1 hilpot,
with his thoughts on the nation s molars, im-
plored mothers to dock the kiddies sugar,
and wound up with another Clapp slogan,
“Eat More Raisins.” Mrs. Glencross sup-
ported Portia Geach’s remarks, and the list-
eners hurried out to spread . terror and dis-
may in a hundred unsuspecting homes.
The Women Automobilists’ clubrooms
blazed like a summer sunset behind
Mrs. 11. J. Robertson, the president,
when she stood on the doorstep the
other afternoon, in silken magpie effects, to
welcome guests to this year’s first tea-drink-
ing. Jessie Smith hushed the teacup clatter
with her full-toned contralto, which is being
cut and polished by Sydney Mannering and
promises to get itself talked about. Frances
Isaacs -aired a soprano which is being fos-
tered by Walter Kirby, and which is also
freighted with promise. Victor Baxter sang,
Bertha Collin recited and Mrs. Arcus fiddled
expressively ; while the .1. W. Reid, James
Angus, Russell Jackson and Leon Jona
matrons, Arnaldo Bartolini, vice-president
Mrs. Felix Lloyd and others kept the Missis-
sippi of small-talk flowing.
There will be an international flavor about
the wedding at Melbourne Grammar chapel
on February 24 of Beryl Zichi-Woinarski,
daughter of the doctor and niece of the Judge,
and Eric Asclie, a nephew of Oscar. Eric
the Red, though he turns up to toil at the
Federal Attorney-General’s Department in
a different car every fifth day or so, imbibed
Sovietism at the fountain-head when he went
to Russia on relief work during the famine.
His latest performance is to spend £2OO of
his own in republishing in Australia, through
the Chaucer Library and the Ruskin Press,
Dr. Anna Louise Strong’s “The First Time
in History”—all about Russia by a lady he
met on his trip over the All-Red route.
The Ernest Letchers parted with their
one ewe lamb, Marjorie, the other night to
Cutlibert Swan at St. Peter’s, East Mel-
bourne, the church where the ’groom’s father
once curated. Marjorie’s charming person
was snowed under white georgette, and she
screened a shy dimple with a shower posy of
water-lilies. Ethel Swan and Dorothy W bite,
who ’maided in fluttering georgette and flow-
ing head-veils, suggested severally a blue and
fuchsia flower. They were squired by Harry
Burford and George Marland. The bride’s
mother, in gold lace and filmy black, dis-
pensed cake and charm at Menzies’; and Mrs.
Swan livened her dusky black dress with
Oriental colors.
One wonders in this wireless age whether
the entrepreneurs of the future will listen-in
for coming Melbas from the comfort of their
-studios. It was almost like this that Theophi-
lus Roberts discovered Peggie Nott, the clever
little Preston
songbird whose
picture byßus-
kin confronts
you. Theophi-
lus happened
to be at the
broadcasting-
studio when
Peggy was
projecting her
voice into the
ether; and so
struck was he
by its size and
quality that he
offered her a
five years’
scholarship on
the spot. The
voice is a dra-
matic contral-
to of great
range and a
rich middle
register. Its owner intends to continue her
office work while her feet are being taught
stage dancing and her voice acquires a con-
cert range; after that she hopes they will be
wage-earners for her.
For four or five years Elsie Bonnie has
been achieving the impossible with the child-
ren in the Government Free Kindergarten,
Yooralla, Carlton. To her were sent those
little ones who by some mishap were back-
ward. Some had had meningitis or infantile
paralysis, and needed to be helped back to
normal life. Others had some obscure nerve
trouble —for it’s not only grown-ups whose
nerves can go wrong. Elsie Bennie has now
decided to devote herself completely to this
task of hers, and is opening a hospital-school
of her own in suburban Armadale. Some of
the mites will be boarders and others will
come in daily. The order-of-the-day will be
kindergarten and other “lessons” with Miss
Bennie, and massage or gymnastics with
Viva Bull, the sister of Louis Esson’s medico
wife. Viva has worked as honorary mas-
seuse for years at the Children’s Hospital,
and knows what it is to see a “hopeless”
muscle respond after two years’ steady treat-
ment. Someone might suggest that it is her
sheer dark-eyed beauty that performs half
the miracle, but she fakes no risks, and de-
pends on her hands and brains.
He was giving afternoon tea to an Eng-
lish dame and a local flapper at a Collins-
street cafe. “I see,” said the lorgnetted
elder lady, “that Asquith has been made an
Earl and is going to take a double title —
Oxford and Asquith.” “A-a-h,” drawled the
ungallant host, “a case of the ox and the
ass.” Only the flapper grinned.
The way One Arm and One Leg and no legs
at a ii—the “wingies” .of the A.l.F.—have
put their shoulders to the wheel of civil life
is very heartening, and nowhere is it better
seen than in Geelong. Every limbless sol-
dier within a radius of 50 miles is a member
of that district’s association, and so com-
plete is its organisation that it can find work
for all, whatever their disabilities. They
never beg, and their activities go even fur-
ther than self-help. Lately they started
a scheme whereby each member contributes
out of his own savings towards a banking
account for every war-orphan in the dis-
trict. It has taken months and much self-
sacrifice to get a sufficient fund together to
launch the scheme. The amount to the credit
of each child is only half a crown, but as
a tribute from the men who gave so much to
the descendants of those that gave every-
thing, it is worth many mountains of pure
gold.
Talma snapped this picture of the popular
Florrie Greene before she farewelled Mel-
bourne the other day with her Westralian
niece, Joy Rolls, for a year of Europe. The
lady is the
younger daugh-
ter of Mel-
bourne’s ’well-
known dancing
teacher ‘and
helped her late
mot h e r t o
make dancing
stars of many
of our girls.
None did more
to help our
charitable
causes than
Mrs. Greene
and her daugh-
ter. Each year
they worked
overtime t o
stage a Town
Hall juveniL
ball, and al-
though Florrie
was one of the
busiest of women, she could always find
time to help launch a charitable effort —and
she was called on to do it about a dozen
times a year. As a ballet-mistress, Florrie,
like her late mother, has few equals; and
every child she instructed called her friend.
The’loss of her mother so told on her health
that the doctors ordered a 12-months’ holiday
before she gets into harness again.
Ralph S. Falkiner, known to his Mel-
bourne pals as “Big Bill,” leaves for London
with his wife and six children next month.
Already his Fidus Achates, Ben Chaffey, is
wearing a yellow waistcoat as a sign of
mourning. “Big Bill” belongs to the Riverina
squatting brotherhood, but has sold a great
deal of his country. He made a good bai’gain
lately. His house Fairholm, with three acres
of land, was advertised for sale and the fur-
niture catalogued. Two days before the sale
Dr. Julian Smith, the Collins-street surgeon,
called to say good-bye to the Falkiners. After
strolling round the house and grounds he
remarked, casually, “How much the lot?”
The owner muttered something substantial,
and the doctor said, “Right, take it; walk in,
walk out!”
A romantic history attaches to an old
house built on the Elizabethan model in St.
Kilda. A wealthy Melbourne youth was
sent to England for a University polish, and
developed, in addition, an ardent affection
for an English girl. It was so far recipro-
cated that he returned to Melbourne to make
a home for his bride-to-be. The home took
the form of a sweet, old-fashioned nest, em-
bowered in gardens, and designed to remind
her of her own country. When it was finished
he sent her photographs, and was rewarded
with the information that she dreaded facing
“a life in the bush” so greatly that she
couldn’t go on with the engagement—in fact,
she had already married someone else. The
house remained empty for some time, and then
became a Girls’ College ; and presently the
growth of St. Kilda ate away the once ample
grounds, leaving the mansion surrounded by
other people’s back-fences. It is a boarding-
house now—every big-enough house in St.
Kilda is a boarding-house or a flats-build-
ing now.
The A. L. Prendergasts red-lettered daugh-
ter Sylvia’s 21st birthday with a jazz flutter
in the Caulfield Town Hall. Their son and
heir had come all the way from Queensland
to tread a measure at sister’s party. The hall
was beflowered and beribboned in pink and
mauve, with a constellation and attendant
moon, and I **the cheerful supper warmed the
cold courthouse adjacent. Mrs. Prender-
gast stood in black satin and tulle, inlaid
with black silver and turquoise. Daughter
Sylvia was a symphony in pale green and
silver, while sister Barbara radiated blue
and crystal.
Colonel Kenneth Smart, who has been
doing a special coastal-defence course at
Woolwich, was called back to Aussie to look
after the Commonwealth Artillery in place
of General Coxen, who has been promoted
Chief of Ordnance with a seat on the Board.
His wife is the only daughter of Colonel Jack
Robertson, who commanded the Queensland
Garrison Artillery. The Colonel himself is
the son of the Edward Smarts of St. Kilda.
With foreign laurels on his brow the
youthful William Neil McKie is roaming old
Melbourne haunts again. lie went to Eng-
land to study at the Royal College of Music,
won an organ scholarship at Worcester Col-
lege, Oxford, where he finished up as B.A.
and Mus. Bac., and now, at 24 years, is
music master at Radley College. He is a
son of the Rev. W. McKie, of Tort Mel-
bourne.
One of the first things Nellie Melba did
after plunging back into the Fog was to
beckon in her protegee, Wilma Berkeley, to
be put through her vocal paces and receive
fresh hints in voice gymnastics. The Dame
is much pleased with the little Victorian
girl’s progress, and unless Mrs. Rumor is
leading us all astray the British public will
soon be given a chance of hearing Wilma in
grand opera.
Another Australian voice to win the
applause of critical Italians who have heard
the best belongs to Francesca Duret, a Mel-
bourne girl who left 18 months ago to study
in Europe. She has made her appearance at
Milan as Lucia. Before that she was on
tour through Italy and sang the soprano
roles in 40 performances. A. C. Bartleman,
who was her tutor in Melbourne, and
arranged for her tuition in Italy, is a proud
man.
After several weeks on the sick list the
Ainslie Mills widow died at her Toorak home
one day last week. ,A 11 who knew the cheer-
ful matron will mourn her passing. She was
the only daughter of the late Colonel Tom
Price and his first wife.
Mrs. Andrew Chirnside has bagged the
night of March 2 for the dance with which
she intends to embellish the autumn season.
The very swish affair will be sheltered at
Charters, Toorak.
Aquatic sports in Adelaide: —
The grand-opera boom is reflected at the Con.,
which is to blossom into an opera school and initiate
its students into mysteries of gesture and deportment,
dramatic work and opera singing. What with
exhibitions of stage dancing and initiation into grand
opera by the official headquarters of music, suburban
papas are going to have a busy time circumventing
the plans of stage-struck daughters. Meanwhile he’s
amply occupied hanging his carpets out to dry
scooping water out of his cellar, and separating
the ornaments from the dinner in the general debris
that is floating about the house. So that nothing
should detract from the possibilities of the week-
end downpour, culverts were nicely choked with
summer dust and rubbish, and the flood waters made
off gaily in whatever direction suited them. In the
low-lying parts it was mostly into houses, and there
are tragic tales of furniture floating out of front
doors. In the flooded streets paddling parties were
as common as at Glenelg on public holidays. The
collapse of a section of Government House will
possibly settle a controversy that has long been
raging in this village, and it is to be hoped that
the authorities of St. Peter’s Cathedral will take
tne hint conveyed by the subsidence of part of the
hideous galvanised-iron affair that, for no earthly
reason, surrounds it.
Was ever crueller luck than the last-minute post-
ponement of the Chief Justice Murrays’ English
trip owing to Miss Murray’s sudden illness? To
have almost done with packing and good-byes, and
be within little more than 24 hours of going on
board, and then have everything cancelled, isn’t the
sort of excitement the most confirmed sensation-
lover would hanker for. The Chief Justice still
hopes that they may get away in March or April.
For the Matheson-McDonald wedding, Chalmers
Church was abloom with white and gold—colors
which the tall, picturesque bride repeated in her
own georgette frock with its velvet, gold-tissue lined
train. Her younger sister and Jean Hill Smith
’maided in gold and white, too, and the trainbearers
were the bridegroom’s two small nieces, Shirley
Hamilton and Patricia Martin. Mrs. McDonald, in
grey and silver, fed everybody at her Norwood home,
where a marquee on the lawn housed tables decked
with the soft pinks and blues of carnations, del-
phiniums and gypsophila.
Mrs. T. C. Walker has heard Helene Taylor's
voice in London and has nothing but good to write
about it. At a Royal Academy of Music concert
she was the Quern of the • Songbirds.
A grey-granite obelisk to commemorate the Austra-
lian Light Horse Regiments is being erected almost
opposite the entrance to the Botanic Gardens.
It will be unveiled by Governor Tom Bridges before
his Ex. trips to the Cold Country, and General Ryrie
will hold forth at the ceremony, The burden of the
big task of raising the necessary cash for this mem-
orial has fallen upon Mrs. B. S. Roach, the hon. sec.,
whose efforts have been seconded by chairman Dr.
Chas. Duguid, president of the Lothians. Gavin
Lawson designed the column, which is to carry a
light at nignt.

Now that State Treasurer Cocks is. going
away to England, everybody is trying to
forget that he has been a politician, and,
therefore, responsible (more or less) for the
girth of our swag of taxation. Fervent
Nationalists are not only giving him pre-
sentations and banquets, but his lady is hav-
ing the brew of farewell passed around in
her honor. The other night Premier Fuller’s
lady wriggled into an armor of jet, and,
sprinkling herself with a few gems, made
for the Nationalist Women’s Club rooms in
York-street. Here she shepherded a large
rally of sister Nationalists, who had gath-
ered to the glory of the new Agent-General’s
madame; and amid the rustle of frocking
conscious of its correctness, speeches were
served in wreaths of smiles. Other floral
offerings were laid at the hem of the guest
of honor’s black georgettes, among them a
basket of pansies and rosemary, handed over
by Mrs. Laverty. Upon further receipt of
a rich leather binding enclosing the auto-
graphs of the club members, the departing
one was so overcome that she made a gal-
lant speech, promising to give Australia all
the help one woman can in the land of the
Saxon.
Though it doesn’t seem to be so in other
States, in N. S. Wales Judges’ wigs run in
families. Of Stephens the Supreme Court
Bench has already had a couple; of Man-
nings two and of Owens a pair; and now
Long Innes follows his father—at some dis-
tance. Forbes, father and son, wore Judges’
robes too, but one was Chief Justice and
the other of the District Court; and Dowl-
ing, senior and junior, had much the same
history as the Forbeses. The new Judge’s
father was on the Bench in the days when
Julian Salomons was at the Bar. No man
ever thought better of his own quality than
little Julian; and in general his opinion
of his contemporaries, especially those on the
bench, was as low as that of himself was
high. “Ah. Sir Julian,” said the genial Long
Innes in the Full Court one day when Salo-
mons came in preceded by a clerk loaded
with books which he dumped on the Bar
table—“ah. Sir Julian, are you going to
quote from all those?” Salomons threw a
supercilious look at the Bench. “Not if
your Honor knows the law,” he replied.
When a doctor taps your ribs and rumbles
“Say 99,” you know he’s looking for trouble.
And that’s what any man would have been
looking for who had denied the equality of
the sexes before the 99 good women and true
who ate to the honor of Kathleen Butler
the other day. Kathleen is the girl who is
helping Dr. Bradfield build the bridge. She
has been the faithful scribe who lias kept
her tablets bright and her typewriter run-
ning smooth for ten years that the Harbor
might be spanned from shore to shore; so
you see she has labored three years more
than Jacob did for his Rachel. But in the
end she got her reward, and the Professional
Women Workers rallied round in their best
slim silhouettes and plumy helmets and
drank her health in iced water and dry
speeches. Some of them toere Sahara-like,
too, with an occasional oasis when Dr. Grace
Boelke threw a momentary twinkler over
proceedings and Grace Scobie passed words
like a benediction around the board. Kath-
leen, who is a tall, capable young woman
with wide-apart, serious eyes, dressed her
russet coloring in the same shades, and in
place of a speech read something very like
a bridge specification to the defenceless list-
eners.
The eldest of three sisters who all married
men witli noted Australian names, Mrs.
John Colebi-ook Elkington, wife of the
head of the Federal Department of
Health at Brisbane, died suddenly on
board the Moreton Bay steamer Koopa
on February 3. Dr. and Mrs. Elking-
ton had been holidaying at Scarborough,
near Redcliffe (Q.), on a long-deferred leave
of absence. The doctor had left and was on
his way to Melbourne when the news reached
him in Sydney. Mary Elkington was a
woman who gave to her husband and her
home the most brilliant qualities of brain as
well as heart, and though she could have
made a name as a writer —her few published
fugitive articles show keen observation and
pretty wit—she never courted publicity. She
had the gift of friendship, and those who
knew her best loved her most. Norman
Lindsay’s first wife is a younger sister of
the late Mrs. Elkington, and the second mar-
ried Edwin, youngest son of the late Dr.
Neild. Melbourne’s famous theatrical medico.
The Parkinsons were Anglo-Indians, and
Mrs. Parkinson, when left a widow, settled
in Melbourne. The family all showed talent.
Ray Parkinson, a clever writer and artist,
who died young, was one of the founders of
the little Rambler— the paper in which
Norman and Lionel Lindsay first came to
light. The late Mrs. Elkington was a hand-
some brunette with brilliant brown eyes.
Universal sympathy will go out to her hus-
band, whose inseparable companion she was.
In days when there were few organisa-
tions to care for the children of mean
streets, unless they were cases for a hospital,
the Fresh Air League brought the bloom of
health back to many pale young cheeks.
One of the mothers of the League, Mrs.
George Kellick, whose devotion never
slackened till ill-health claimed her, has just
passed away. The tall, slightly-stooped
figure of this true philanthropist had left
the 83rd milestone behind.
Mrs. Hugh D. Mclntosh will be able to
buy a new ermine stole as a result of the
swimming contests at the Manly baths on
Saturday. The popular president of the
N.S.W. Ladies’ Amateur Swimming Asso-
ciation offered a trophy worth 25 guineas to
the first Australian girl to beat Marieschen
Wehselau, the fish-girl from Hawaii; but
although all the girls were generously pro-
portioned, and one at least as amply pro-
tected against salt-water chills as Marieschen
herself, the visitor put 25 yards between her-
self and the next girl in the 300 yards
scratch race. Marieschen drives her not in-
considerable bulk bodily through the water,
and only visits the surface occasionally to
spout; the enormous under-water thrust she
gives at the beginning of every length gains
her a couple of yards per turn.
The always-crowded Coogee trams scarcely
afforded room to lodge a grievance the other
night when visiting Marieschen Wehselau
was billed to swim in the quarter-mile cham-
pionship at the Aquarium. Surf sirens and
Neptune’s daughters turned out in hundreds
to watch the event, though the result was
pretty well a foregone conclusion. There
were only four starters, and the Sydney girls
were all of Bondi. Claire Cauldwell made
the best running, although the girl from
Hawaii outdistanced her by 35 yards. The
Sydney girls were gallant in defeat, and
simply rushed through the water to kiss the
winning one’s cheek. The scene would have
given sculptor Theo Cowan a beautiful study
for a group of modern naiads.
A party of 50 bush kiddies from 5 to 12
years old were brought for a holiday trip
to Sydney the other day. A number of them
saw their first train when they reached the
line, and the spectacle so terrified one six-
year-old that he took refuge in an iron tank
and had to be bribed to come out. Yet
every one of the tourists was familiar with
motors, and several of those who were be-
coming acquainted for the first time with a
train had seen aeroplanes.
May Moore presents the soft, brown eyes
of Matron Elizabeth Leslie-Smith, who is
in charge of Canonbury, the beautiful A.J.C.
home for disabled soldiers. Miss Leslie-
Smith went
soldiering her-
self for four
years: Egypt,
India, France
and England
knew her in
the war days,
and at the end
of the fighting
the little lady
with the soft
voice came
back as sister
to Russell Lea,
the hospital
for shell-
shocked
patients. From
there she
joined her
friend, Miss
Kircaldie, the
first matron of
Cano nbury,
and a year or so later became chatelaine of
the pleasant place. The house, built right
on the water’s edge at Darling Point, was
first the home of Harry Rickards, and has
the Harbor from the Heads to the melting
distances for an amazing back-cloth. As
grey as the cruiser that lay almost at the
foot of the lawn was Port Jackson the other
afternoon. Blacker grew the clouds above
till the water became a sheet of lead; then
the rain fell, like a shower of silver darts
piercing the melancholy of the day. Half
an hour later came the sun and opalescence.
From their wheeled chairs on the balcony
the man who knits socks and the one who
plaits baskets watched the changing scene,
and the looker-on couldn’t but be glad that
if there must be war there are also the
Canonburys and the Matron Leslie-Smiths.
The Florentine beauty of J. C. William-
sons, Rowena Ronald, has just owned up that
she was married before the evening show on
January 29. Dean Talbot got through the
job with neatness and despatch at 6.30 so
that the principal man of the act, Herbert
Browne, could get his best make-up on in
time for his first cue in “Wildflower,” in
which he .plays principal to Marie Burke.
Rowena is a raving beauty with blue eyes,
red-gold hair and a skin like the petals of a
liedge-rose. She’s got brains, too, and has
decided talent for music. The other day she
carried off the Green Room’s “Brains-
Beauty” prize. The happy man is a brother
of Blanche Browne, of “Our Miss Gibbs”
fame, and has had successes playing “oppo-
site” to Gladys Moncrieff and under the
Oscar Aschc management. Before the foot-
lights claimed him he was an engineer.
Rowena. by the way, is in the Beauty Chorus
of the show in which her bridegroom leads.
Time was when pirates hung out the sign
of the skull and scoured the high seas in
anatomical research. But did they get their
pictures in the papers ? Well, things are
changed now,
and the skull-
ma n is no
longer an out-
law, but a bril-
liant scientist.
Here is one
of the most
s c i ntillating.
He is Ray-
mond Dart,
and it is
claimed for
him that he
has found in
South Africa
the missing
link. The
young man
hails from
near Laidley,
in Queensland,
and his father
a n d mother
live at In-
dooroopilly in that State. He is an Ips-
wich Grammar boy, and was one of the first-
year students at the Bi'isbane Uni. He is
a graduate of Sydney Uni., and went to
the war in 1916 in the Army Medical.
After the war he became senior lecturer in
anatomy at University College, London,
where Australia’s own Grafton Elliot Smith
is the big chief. From here he gained a
Rockefeller scholarship for research work in
America. Crossing over, he found much learn-
ing, and a wife—she’s in the doctoring trade
herself. Later came the appointment to the
Chair of Anatomy in Witwatersrand, South
Africa, where lurked the skull that thrust
him into the cables.
The Australian manufacturer does get
honor, if not in his own country. O. C.
Beale, who has preached the gospel of the
Australian-made piano for a lifetime, has
enrolled no less a person than the Queen of
England as a disciple. Queen Mary went
to Wembley, saw a Beale Baby Grand
dressed up in walnut, and decided to buy it.
It wasn’t done quite so quickly as that. The
first time H.R.H. was with the Prince of
Wales, and they were making an unofficial
call on the Australian pavilion. Once again
the bachelor of England dropped in on the
overseas pianos, and a few days later Queen
Mary reappeared, paid the usual deposit,
and had the Baby Grand sent up to Buck-
ingham Palace.
Jean Robertson, who plays lead to Mosco-
vitcli in the “Outsider,” frocks her attractive
self in’ the color of golden sands in her first
two acts. Both of the gowns are made with
the cape effect, and the second is a souffle of
ninon and silk lace. The lace cape of this
has its two ends caught at the wrists, form-
ing a sleeve illusion. The lady has what our
friend John Longstaff would call a well-
balanced face, and she wears it and her rip-
pling black hair to stunning effect in the
last act, when she is wrapped about in the
roseate hue of romance. When she takes her
first timid steps to the outstretched arms
of love, Jean is supported by a softly falliug
neglige of pink georgette, nebulous as a
cloud at sunrise, which swoons beneath a top
layer of primrose lace.
Mosman’s big movie theatre, the Austra-
lian, was packed as tight with humans the
other night as a lettuce leaf is with vita-
mines. The North Side had rolled up in
battalions to give its own songbird, Essie
Ackland, a testimonial concert quite apart
from the city function. Essie’s contralto
sounded more ’cello-like than usual, and the
enthusiasts levied encore after encore from
the smiling girl, and from the long list of
brother- and sister-fytists who helped to
build up the programme. At the end Essie
was called to the footlights, and the Mayor
of Mosman thrust upon her a garland of fair
words on behalf of the community and a
manicure set upholstered in Russian leather
on behalf of the local kirk. At this point
the enthusiasm of the multitude boiled over,
and the house burst into Auld Lang Syne.
The Chelsea Arts Ball doesn’t have all
the bright ideas. Out Riverina way they
put up something of a record in fancy cos-
tumes the other night. The local champion
had come home from the district sports
loaded with honors, and the town felt it
really ought to celebrate the event in proper
style, so a plain and fancy-dress dance was
decided on. Tlie post-mistress described
the flutter the next day as a very fine affair,
but disappointing as to the number of fancy
costumes. Qustioned further, she admitted
there were only three, and under cross-
examination divulged particulars. “Well,
there was Mrs. Smith —she went as
‘Departed Spirits,’ dressed in a shroud, and
every now and then uttering a kind of
shriek. And Mr. Smith he went as a
‘Restless Night.’ ” Here she stopped dead,
and started to hand out the stamps the visi-
tor had asked for. “Well,” the customer
prodded, “what on earth did Tic do?” “Oh,
well,” the post-mistress continued, “he just
wore a pair of pyjamas an’ carried a candle,
and every now and again he’d light, the
candle and pick little black things off his
coat!” P.S. —Miss Smith was all yellow
and brown stripes. She went as a goanna.
The Kate Rooney cabaret was last week’s
magnet for jazzing feet. More than 700
pairs tried to mingle in the whirl, and the
race was to the strong. However, the result
will be a smiling cheque towards Lewisham’s
Queen in the Hospital Queen Competition.
The contralto wore her rich smile pinned
to the mast, and sang in a voice that was
honeysuckle and dew. She had threatened
to wear a hula hula, sound a tom-tom and
carry a pawpaw, but, instead, turned out in
velvet frocking suggestive of an ocean grey-
hound ; against it she clutched an armful of
scarlet carnations and mauvey-blue del-
phiniums. When not otherwise engaged she
sat up with the president of the dance, Mrs.
Flynn, who further decorated her table with
new Gaud Mayor Stokes and pink cactus-
dahlias. The newly-returned Mrs. Trefle
and Mrs. Dodd were others in this group.
Marie Burke, of “Wildflower,” is the
Queen of the Crown-street Women’s Hospi-
tal in the struggle for the Royalty Stakes.
For next Tuesday, which marks the century
of “Wildflower,” Marie, Floie Allen, Marie
La Yarre and Gus Bluett plan a special
celebration, the cash results of which will
go to the Better Baby institution in Crown-
street. Anybody anxious to know what they
are up to can find out by calling at the vesti-
bule of Her Majesty’s, the Ambassadors or
the Australia on that day.
The 14-year-old Phyllis McDonald, who
went away two years ago from Sydney with-
a Royal Academy scholarship, is heard of
now in London. She has gained a further
scholarship, is a first violin in Henry Wood’s
orchestra, and during his season Kreisler
went at Sir Henry’s invitation to hear the
Australian youngster play. When Phyllis’s
bow had sighed out its long-drawn sweet-
ness, Kreisler turned with a comprehensive
nod to his friend and uttered the quint-
essence of an artist’s approval. “She
know r s!” he said.
A P.S. from a Brisbane sister:—
His Ex. is away at Stanthorpe, tasting the prime
fruits at the annual show. They are extra-fine this
season. Sir Matthew paid a tribute to the work of
Professor Goddard, Hubert Jarvis and F. A. Perkins
in helping to swat the fruit-fly. There was plenty
still to be done, however, in insuring fruitgrowers
against losses by hail, which plays havoc every year
amongst Stanthorpe’s cherry-trees. Major Costello
offered thanks. The gate takings were £3O more
than last year, and climbed up towards £2OO. Broad-
water took the district prize.
I must have been thinking of the Golden Casket—
we think a good deal in its terms in Bananaland—
when my pen said the Savage Club was limited to
500 members. Fifty is to be the limit.
The Fraser and Leitch families were united by the
express wish of Claude Fraser and Gladys Leitch in
the Windsor Baptist Chapel. Palms and pink-and-
white blossomry formed the backcloth, and ivory
brocade, with a cloth-o’-silver train and a wedding
veil of old Spanish lace covered the bride. Dorothy
Leitch and Isabel Christie ’maided in blue and silver ;
the Cunningham and Peel girls in pink and silver,
J. Leitch was best man and Albert Phipps grooms-
man. The bride’s father tied the knot, and 50
guests ate the breakfast at Finney’s, which was hung
with silver bells and horseshoes.
On the same night Kathleen Gilmour took Eric
Mackay for better for worse in the Ann-street kirk,
dressed in pink and white for the occasion. The bride
wore French crepe with a silver lace train, and car-
ried a silver floral fan. Alice Gill sang “Because.”
The Bellevue —it wore pink and blue —saw the after-
jollo, and Sydney and the Blue Mountains watch the
’moon arise.
St. Thomas’s Hall, Toowong, was nicely dressed for
the farewell to the J. E. H. Osborns. Lieut.-Colonel
Durrant said the pleasant things, and Charlie Elliot
handed out two gold wristlet-watches to the departees.
A wallet of notes, a case of pipes, a clock and a
powder box will also need to be packed by the
departing cleric and his spouse when they go to Too-
woomba. They have been good friends to the Diggers
here. The cake and tea were helped on their way
by recitations and music.
Freda Bage is back, with tender memories of
Denmark, where she stayed with the Carl Melchiors.
He knew Hans Andersen, and his home shows traces
of the fairymaker in picture and poem.
Mrs. T. J. Ryan has gone to Melbourne to place
her boy at Xavier’s.
The president of the Windsor Croquet Club invited
a hundred to say good-bye to Mrs. Dinsdale, who
will push Australia through English hoops in the test
matches in June. A Holdsworth croquet mallet was
handed to the Queensland champion. Mr. Dinsdale
goes with his spouse, and daughter Beryl leaves in
March for S. Africa to visit a married daughter in the
Back of Beyond, where the ape-man used to roam.

SURE CATCH TACKLE
The finest programme Victorian racegoers
have witnessed in 1925 was presented at the Williams-
town course on Saturday. Circumstantial reports
as to the health and track work of Prince Florizcl
resulted in the much-improved Woorak —Perdita geld-
ing seeing 6 to 4 for the W.vndham Handicap, 11
furlongs. With Lewis on top the Prince came home
strongly ahead of Storm Queen (12’s) and Ouragan
(33’s), with Accarak, Murray King and other well-
backed out of the picture; and the winner
must possess a reasonable chance in the Australian
Cup with 7st. 211). But it might be unprofitable to
discard Murray King on this particular run. Mercian
King (B’s), a. fine two-year-old, but hitherto disap-
pointing at. Derby age, finished ahead of Trice, who
runs in vice-regal colors, and Validus in the Marine
Handicap; Kidlaw (5 to 2) was the first, favorite to
fail in _ five races. There were some heavy losses
over this three-year-old—he wasn’t in the first eleven
—and nobody collected on Beeline (25’s) after the
February Welter, not even unlucky Jimmy Truskett.
For the rest, Lilypond gave those who had laid 5 to 1
on The Night Patrol a thrill over the last lialf-furlong
of the new mile C. F. Orr Stakes, and Amalfi was only
two lengths behind the Governor’s horse at the finish.
This doesn’t mean that The Night Patrol has deterior-
ated, but it draws attention to the forthcoming en-
gagements of the shop-getters, especially Lilypond.
With the exception of Eurythniic he is the fastest
horse that ever came out of the West, and the farther
they travel the better he likes it.

Though heavy rain had made the going
slow at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.), the running was
fairly true to figures, well-backed fancies taking four
of the eight events. Some gloom was evident when
Gaelic Maid, backed to 5 to 4, was beaten a length
by Doreen in the first division of the Three-year-
old! Handicap. Doreen (Kenilworth —Stratus) opened
at 6 to 1, slid to 15’s, and went out at 14’s —a nice
price considering that she had won at Gosford four
days before, but punters were in a suspicious mood.
Gaelic Maid is smart, and it was rather a. good per-
formance to heat her handily at a difference of 21b. ;
indeed. Doreen is worth keeping in mind. Anesetc
(o’s) befriended many of the public in the second
division, hut four of the six starters in the Flving
Mile -were better backed than Mountain Lad (s’s),
who ran home an easy winner from St. Bryde (10’s),
the favorite, Flippinere, galloping very sourly. And
Lanome, an even-money shot for the first division of
file Highweight Handicap, had no chance over the
last furlong against Bellambi (4’s), another who
■will probably succeed in better company. The second
division went to the uncertain Tingle (6 to 4), who
wus due for a win. The Wild Goose was favorite for
the 11-furlongs Canterbury Handicap, but failed again,
the hurdler Lord Satin (7’s) fairly outstaying him.
The grey horse has been a costly proposition this
summer.

“Senojo”: Maurice Blackburn’s victory in
the Fitzroy (Vic.) by-election was a bitter blo-w to
the pony-racing and bookmaking section of the Labor
party, for Maurice has no use for the parasites who
batten on the wage-earners’ craze for betting. Know-
ing this, the pony and McShortodds gang did their
darnedest to dish Blackburn, and their methods were
so dirty that they have offended Labor politicians who
have hitherto voted submissively for reduced betting-
taxes and against the totalisator. In fact, there are
predictions that when the Tote Bill comes on again
it will receive strong Labor support as a reprisal
for the uuclean work at Fitzroy. However, cynics
acquainted -with the inside history of the Vic. Labor
party and the source of fat donations to party funds
only smile at the threats of cutting the horse-
gambling cancer out.

“E.G.K.”: Fired by a report that the
European racing club had cleared a profit of £5O
on its last meeting, the Indians in Fiji decided to
run an effort of their own. Hastily forming a club,
they, with some difficulty, hired the racetrack, but
before issuing a license, the Government stipulated
that a reputable white man must act as judge, and
that two others should operate the totalisator. This
was all satisfactorily arranged, and a fee of two
guineas was promised to each man responsible for
the machine. The rest of the story is related in
the following missive:—
“Nadi, Fiji,
“15th January, 1925.
“Blank, Esq. Dear Sir, —I am tremendously re-
gretted to forward a few lines fo let you know that
my club has sustained some loss from the race
meeting held on 3rd of instant.
“I am very sorry that under the circumstances l
am unable to meet with the promised amount to-
wards the compensation of your tedious labour kindly
rendered in Tot. House.
“I ardently hope that you will oblige my club by
accepting our heartiest thanks for your genial assist
anee during the procedure Of the said meeting.
“Thanking you in anticipation for your generosity
of accepting our thanks instead. —Yours expectant,
(signed) Bajnath, pro tan. sec.”

“B. 7G” : At the last Thursday Island meet-
ing I attended holders of tote-tickets on the winner of
the Herald race (10 starters) dropped sixpence on every
five shillings staked. The jockeys were officers and men
from a warship, and the wild plunge was on the
only jockey who seemed likely to keep his mount
on the course. The rest went bush soon after the
start.

The brilliant riding of Cecil Walker lias been
a feature of the Sydney professional cycling season. On
Saturday the man from Marrickville easily defeated
Arthur Sp< n::e]\ Ray Eaton. Willie Grimm (all Ameri-
cans) and Leslie Hammond in a mile race, alleged
to be for the Australian championship. Walker also
beat Eaton and Gerald Halpin in a “triangular”
sprint, and finished the night by landing the five-
miles scratch race in llmin. 2sec. In Melbourne
the same night Harris Holder, also of N. S. Wales,
accounted for Bailey, the Englishman ; Beecher, the
Victorian: and Willie Spencer, brother of Arthur,
in the mile “Derby.” Australia certainly produces
some great track cyclists.

In the race, on the Derwent River, for the
, Forster Cup, the six States were represented by their
fleetest 21ft. restricted-class yachts, but the mainland
craft had no chance with Tassie, one of the two
local boats. Designed by her skipper, Percy Batt,
and built in a few
weeks of local material
(the keel was laid
late in December), she
cleared away from her
adversaries in all three
heats, winning the first
by 59sec„ the second
by lmin. 42sec. and
the third by lmin.
23sec. The N. S.
Wales representatives,
Wattle and Nettle,
were second and third
respectively on points,
and the Governor-
General’s Corella was
fourth. It was the
first time the Spec.t
had had a shot at the
cup. and Tassie’s suc-
cess made the islanders
forget Walsh and the
Navigation Act for the
time being. In six
starts she has never
been beaten across the
finishing line, al-
though in ond race she
was disqualified for
fouling the starting-
buoy.

The speedy Baby Tortoise motor-boat be-
haved like a restive colt in a recent race on the
Port Adelaide River. Rounding a buoy, it stood
up on edge, tipped the Rymills, father and son,
into the river, and then dashed off on its own. The
odds were strongly on its running on to a soft bank
among the mangroves; but instead it perverse!)
headed for a beacon, and smashed itself on the piles.

“Hamer”: .Toe Fox (B. 5/2/’25), who
made a good fight of each of his 11 engagements in
Australia, has packed his port, for England. In
ten months of hard going he earned just on £2OOO.
Not bad for a featherweight, but the business has
slumped greatly during the last few months, and
Fox is positive that he can do better in his own
country.

Algie Daniels, the Tasmanian middle-
weight, who can’t get a fight at the Sydney Stadium,
strengthened his claim to the Commonwealth title
by outpointing Merv Williams at Brisbane. Giving
a sterling exhibition of boxing, the young man
from the Speck got all over Williams, who knocked
skin and hair off the Stadium importation, Shade —
the same whom Wren once talked of matching against
Carpentier for a stupendous side-wager—and the
crowd cheered Algernon lustily, although Williams,
now a Balmain publican, is a Queenslander born.
Tommy Fairhall, another pug. for whom Stadiums,
Ltd., has had little time, has twice in recent weeks
whipped Plees, the welterweight from Belgium. On
Saturday he made the Fleming stop in 11 rounds.
Fairhall, who learned his boxing in the Newcastle
district, is a sure-fisted young fellow, clever with
his head and fast on his feet. With a bit more
combat ive.ness he would do well in the U.S.A..
where he is very anxious to go, Australia having been
invited to send a contender for the lightweight
championship which Benny Leonard lias passed in.

“H. Hardupp”: If there is any man in

Quirk, the Stadium referee, I have yet to meet
THE MENU.
“What did you have for dinner to-night?”
“Mailey 's howling, Ponsford's hatting and Gregory’s fielding.”
him. A look of ineffable weariness sits on Val.’s
expressive chiv from the moment a fight, begins.
W hen he dives in to break two clinching opponents
he has the aspect of one whose patience is sorely
tried, but who is prepared to put up with just a,
little more for the sake of the audience. At the
conclusion of each round he retires to a spare
coiner and ruminates, with his hands folded in
front of him. Occasionally his lips, move slightly ;
and the guess may be either that he is offering up
a short prayer for better fighters or that he is doing
a sum in mental arithmetic. When his night’s work
is over he never reveals the thoughts that have
furrowed his forehead throughout the proceedings.
Perhaps he is saving them up for a treatise on the
game.
The wrestling bout at Melbourne between
the American Ted Th.ve, alleged to be light-heavy-
weight champion of the world, and Karasich, of
Russia, was always strenuous and at times thrilling.
In the first round Thye accidentally hit the Russian
on the nose, and in the subsequent grappling the
memory of that punch seemed to linger. Thye was
the more skilful wrestler, but the Russian was clever
in evasion and as strong as a bull. At the end of
the sixth round Thye seemed so affected by the
rough handling that he walked the wrong way to his
corner. In the eighth he staggered to the ropes and
hung on, while the Russian gripped him about the
body. Then Thye got his arms under his opponent’s
and threw himself back ; and the crowd W'as aston-
ished to see both men fall like a ton of meat, with
Karasich underneath and both shoulders on the mat—
a clean fall, and Thye the winner. But wrestling is
an astonishing business altogether.
* * * *
The barracker who, on the opening day
of the second England v. Vic. match, told Sandham
that he would never earn his living by piecework
made a neat comment on the deplorable slowness of
the proceedings. Runs that came in fours now and
then were the gifts of erratic bowlers and lifeless
fielders ; for the most part the Englishmen refused to
take any risk. Hearne, forgetting that his bat had
been given him for smiting purposes, stood for over
after over merely using it as a sort of portable fence
to protect his stumps. He stolidly compiled 121 n. 0.,
and raised it to 193 on the second day without being
bright at any period. In the Englishman’s total of
500, Bryan’s 59 was the one spasm of brightness.
There was some interest in a rapid fall of wickets
when Rayson, having at last trapped Whysall—the
Notts man made 89, 1 more than Sutcliffe —got
Douglas and Kilner as well in the same over; and
Iremonger finished off the innings by bagging three
wickets with as many balls. The left-hander w'ound up
with 5 for 93 ; Rayson’s three cost 161. Victoria
had lost one wicket (Mayne’s) for 35 when stumps
wore drawn, 10 minutes before time, because of the
dull light.
When play was resumed on Monday Bryan cap-
tained the visitors instead of Douglas, who had been
mixed up in a Sunday motoring accident, but the
substitute had an easy job. Rain had damaged the
wicket, and only Ransford (62) and Woodfull (60)
made a creditable showing, six batsmen being sent
back to the pavilion for a total of 10, whereas there
were 12 sundries. The tenth wicket fell at 179,
Kilner taking 5 for 48 and Hearne 3 for 39. Going
in again on a pitch which had become a gluepot,
the Victorians lost 6 for 14, ICilner’s share being
5 for 3. From the Australian viewpoint it was a
ghastly day’s cricket, and the next lot of Aussies to
tour England will pay dearly for the practice of
covering the wicket if 1926 is like 1886 or 1888.
The worst of it is that the Commonwealth has no
bowlers who can be relied unon to rival the fine
performances of Kilner. for they, together with the
batsmen, get no practice on sticky wickets. On
Tuesday the last four wickets fell for 36, Kilner
ending with 7 for 18, and England won by an
innings and 271 runs.
* * * *
“Tuart” : My idea of reforming cricket is
to have all matches decided in one playing day and
on runs alone. Thus a team all out for 150 would
beat one that failed to reach that total, even if it
had one down for 149. 1 would allow two hours
for each innings, and 10 minutes between, the second
batting side to have the advantage of time gained by
putting the other lot out in less than two hours.
Further, I would give each captain the right to
withdraw a batsman
who wasn’t scoring
fast enough, although
he had kept his wicket
up, and to repeat the
operation at discre-
tion. My proposals
would do away with
stonewalling, “wait-
ing for the loose
hall,” luncheon and
tea adjournments, leis-
urely movements in
the field, yells of
“Bowl on the wicket”
and “You’ll never get
’em out,” and the
idiotic laughter pro-
duced by those asinine
observations. Time
being the essence of
the contract, there
would be no place in
the new scheme for
the batsman who take 3
an hour to “play him-
self in,” and six hours
to make a hundred,
and the bowler who
runs 20 yards prepara-
tory to delivering a
medium-pace ball
would likewise find his
occupation gone, but
there would be room
and a welcome for
such as N. P. Cohen,
who, for Sydney v.
Petersham, hit 61 (out
of 87) in half an hour
on a bad wicket. More-
over, batsmen would
run from the pavilion
to the pitch instead of
strolling languidly
there and back; and,
instead of changing
ends after six or eight
balls, bowlers would
peg away from the
same end, each in his
turn, until a wicket
had fallen. If these changes were introduced cricket
would become a real game, the finest in the ■world. A
Test match which lasts seven days doesn’t deserve to
be called a game ; rather is it a disease.
“Hamer”: H. S. Gamble, the young Victorian fast
bowler, has modelled his style on that of E. A.
McDonald. Coming on -when N. S. Wales wanted
a mere 60, with seven wickets in hand, he created
a doubt as to the achievement of what seemed an
easy task. He dismissed Bardsley and Kelleway
with successive balls, and later Punch and Oldfield;
and, although kept on when he was tiring, finished
with 4 for 38 —on a first-class wicket. And he got
the usual reward. Instead of being rushed with
direct opportunit)' against the Englishmen, he was
asked to consider himself lucky in being named as
emergency bowler.
“0.P.H.” : Who says Government depart-
ments are humorless? In informing an Anglican
parson that his Sunday-school cricket club might put
a pitch on a piece of seaside land, the Victorian
Barnacle w T ho dealt with the application stipulated
that there should be no games on Sunday.
* * * ‘ *
“Wink” : Now that the Sheffield Shield
contests are over for another season, it is curious to
note that many regular Test batsmen were outplayed
by their State mates in the lesser games. Ponsford
was the exception. He won Victoria’s aggregate with
371, 15 ahead of the consistent but doleful Woodfull,
who, however, won the race for the average with 89
to Ponny’s 61. Liddicutt’s average of 65,
Hendry’s (59) and Tarrant’s (45) were all
well ahead of that recorded by Ryder,
Vic.’s other international, whose 31 put him
tenth on the list. In N. S. Wales, Rock, with 440,
averaging 146, and Kippax, with 552, averaging 133,
were miies in front of Bardsley, Andrews and Collins.
A more consistent bat for South Oss than either of
the Richardsons was the left-hander, Pritchard. His
record of 488, average 81, easily tops their list, and
calls for recognition from the Test selectors. Grimmett,
of the same State, stands pre-eminent as a collector
of wickets in Shield matches. Mailey, 16, Hendry and
Hartkopf, 12 each, headed the list in their States,
but Clarrie accounted for 28 victims at an average
of 24. The amount of work he got through and
the quality of his trundling are further stressed by
the fact that Arthur Richardson, whose 5 wickets
cost 85 runs each, was S.A.’s second-best bowler.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: Now that it has been de-
cided to send another Davis Cup team to America,
it may be as well to consider how its members will
stand in view of the revised laws defining amateurism
adopted by the U.S. authorities since our men
were last there. As the rules of the Amateur
Sporting Federation, with which the N.S.W.L.T.A.
is affiliated, stand at present, any member of any
sporting body receiving more than ss. per day,
outside of travelling and hotel expenses, is guilty
of professionalism. At least one Davis Cup team
sent to America received £2 per day per man, and
other privileges as well. It is suggested that the
rule is merely a matter of form, and that in any
case the Australian authorities would at once give
a guarantee that our players are bona fide amateurs,
which guarantee would be accepted abroad. As to
the first contention, it must be pointed out that
the ss. rule is rigidly observed by other members
of the Federation, such as the Rugby Union, the
Swimming Association, the athletic bodies and
others, and the Tennis Association has certainly no
title to special exemption even if it asked for it,
■which it has not done. For the rest, if the
tennis authorities gave such a guarantee, they would
be guilty, not only of a flagrant breach of the
amateur laws here, but of an inexcusable act of had
faith toward outsiders.
A DREADFUL PROSPECT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Lord Hawke, interviewed at Colombo, repeated
that it would be a bad day for cricket when no
amateur could be found good enough to captain an
English, side. It was better to lose with a man like
Gilligan for captain than to subordinate everything to
winning.”
Shall I wring my hands and blubber just because weVe
lost the rubber ?
Shall my noble brows be knit in poignant woe?
Nay, I’d sooner see us routed ’neath an amateur
undoubted
Than victorious —and skippered by a pro.
And to Heaven I make petition with my ancestors
patrician
In the family mausoleum I’ll be laid
Ere our English champions rattle from the dressing-
room to battle
With an officer commanding who is paid!
I have lived till legislators draw their screw—the
same as waiters —
Though it would have seared their fathers’ hearts
■with shame.
Still, I make you the concession that their job is a

Whereas cricket is, or ought to be, a game.

Like the medical officer of Liang Shao Pao,
Emperor of China, who was sent to learn
anatomy during an execution of thieves by
the slow slicing method, Anton Ragatzy, the
Russian-American bonesetter of “The Out-
sider,” now showing at Sydney Royal, learnt
his art by empirical means. His father sent
him to the Chicago slaughter-yards to watch
hogs and steers being executed for canning
purposes. Armed with this valuable experi-
ence, he performs miracles in London on the
human body until his fame and fees become
so enlarged that the Royal College of Sur-
geons has to take notice. It offers him
official benediction if be will walk the hospi-
tals and qualify for a degree. He scorns
their M.lX’s; and when they cast him forth
he lures the crippled daughter of the greatest
surgeon of them all, Jasper Sturdee, away
with him, to stretch her injured leg on his
patent “rack” for 12 months. Incidentally,
Lalage has a fiance who loves her soul and
would marry her body if it were only whole.
The bonesetter cures the one and captures the
other, and the curtain falls to the music of
a long-drawn kiss. Except perhaps for the
kiss and some other improbabilities, the
story is simply that of Barker, the famous
English bonesetter, who with his miraculous
hands cured so many British soldiers of
“incurable” deformities during the late war

that, although the faculty refused to recog-
nise him, the King was constrained to give
him a knighthood.
* * * *
Having been guessed over by 17 qualified
medicine-men for an obscure complaint
which was subsequently correctly diag-
nosed by an ordinary X-ray photographer,
this Showman has no illusions about medical
practitioners; but he refuses to accept
the witch-doctor of this play as credible,
either. Dorothy Brunton, who is the
playwright, is stated to have been a
cripple, too, and to have been cured in the
same unorthodox fashion; and her animus
against authorised healers rages throughout
the piece. She spoils her play as propa-
ganda by introducing the thoroughly-absurd
“rack”; and she spoils it as drama by in-
troducing an equally absurd happy ending, in
which the patient, after being strapped on
an operating-table for a year, gets up and
walks straight into her lover’s arms. The
office physician, who reinforced this Page’s
judgment by attending on the night, says
that, even if the feat were possible without
preliminary massage, the lady will certainly
develop adhesions in all the other limbs.
The brilliant acting of Maurice Mosco-
vitch as the bonesetter helped to redeem
a not very brilliant play. Rude, tender,
blustering, greedy and inspired by turns, he
dominated liis patients, his detractors, the
Royal College of Surgeons and the audience.
Eccentric gestures, a flexible voice and a
foreign accent helped him. Jean Robertson,
the Australian girl who took the part of
Lalage Sturdee, submitted patiently to the
rack, displayed charm in her gentler
moments, but failed to quite rise to the
crisis of the final scene. Eileen Sparkes was
capable as Mme. Ivlost, another patient of
Ragatzy, but her byplay as a nurse in the
third act did not deserve the titters it re-
ceived. The medical profession was ably
represented by William Stack, H. Macken-
zie—Rogan, Arthur Greenaway and G. Kay
Souper; and Nat Madison, a son of Mosco-
vitch, played the part of a renegade doctor
with effective simplicity. Basil Bowen, as
Basil Owen —-or is it Basil Owen as Basil
Bowen? —was an insincere and vacillating
lover. The audience showed its contempt for
doctors and dramatic construction and its
appreciation of fine acting by bringing Mos-
covitcli to the front of the curtain again and
again.

“Rosie O’Reilly” continues to shin up the
ladder of social distinction at Sydney Opera
House. This is the eighth week of her spec-
tacular elevation.
“Wildflower” has been transplanted from
the Theatre Royal to Her Majesty’s. The
gorgeous bloom outgrew its earlier quarters —
or rather those who came to see it did—
like a plant its pot or a policeman his boots.
There are only 10 nights left in which
to see “The Green Goddess” and Guy Bates

crasies.

Readers of Dickens, from juvenile stu-
dents of “The Pickwick Papers” to the
gloomy ancient who spends his days trying
to find an ending for “The Mystery of Edwin
Drood,” should pay at least one visit to
Sydney Tivoli during Clement May’s sojourn
there. His characterisations of Uriah Ileep
and Fagin are excellent. He gets Scrooge’s
whine, and only a robust figure prevents
him from being a faithful miser. The only
other conspicuous newcomer is Cardini, who
performs miracles with a pack of cards. Van
Cello still twirls barrels, and the Six Brown
Brothers make the saxophone almost a
musical instrument.
“Any Old Thing,” Phil Smith’s latest at
Sydney Fullers’, isn’t: it is an improvement
on last week’s revue, which was better than
the week-before’s. The plot may run to
water in these 90-minute sketches, but the
songs have a swing and a kick, and the danc-
ing of the ballet and the backchat of the
comedians is always willing. The vaudeville
side of the show isn’t as half as strong as
it ought to be, although Linn Smith’s Jazz
Band uses desperate efforts twice daily to
make up the deficiency.
Australian-made pictures started badly—
with poor adaptations of popular stories and
slipshod production. Since then the indus-
try, seeing the chances it was throwing away,
has made fairly satisfactory strides. The
technical direction, certainly, has improved
out of sight, and thg producers are beginning
to acquire a smattering of literary know-
ledge. “The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,”
the latest local venture at the Crystal Palace
(Sydney), is a ten-reel film, and was adapted
from the novel by Fergus Hume. The photo-
graphy is good, and the story holds the in-
terest until the finish. Arthur Shirley, its
producer, fills the rSle of Brian Fitzgerald,
and Grace Glover gives sympathetic sup-
port as his fiancee. Cora Warner is a Mother
Guttersnipe who knows that that sort of
thing can easily be overdone, and Isa Cross-
ley, as Sal Rawlin, is effective.
In the town house of the profligate Gerard,
Earl of Beverley, where are gathered all the
gay, well-dressed elements necessary to make
the bright choruses and dances of a musical
comedy, a bombshell is thrown into the mid-
night revelry by the announcement of the
young dog’s father, the Duke of Crow-
borough, that, unless the youngster makes
up his mind to marry, and so carry on the
family tradition (that is to say, provide an
heir to keep up his orgies in a new genera-
tion), he will be deprived of the allowance
which is paying for all the riot. Obstinately
desperate, Gerard calls for entertainers to
help him forget the threat; and, it being re-
membered that a shy country girl who has
taken a job as kitchen-maid in the riotous
mansion can dance, she is “rung in.” Ilcr
performance gives the gay lord an idea —
by marrying the kitclienmaid he will obey
the old man’s command and at the same time
turn obedience into an insult. His idea is
to send bis wife away into the country imme-
diately after the ceremony; but the charming
way in which Betty fits into the costumes
and circumstances of her improved position

creates complications; and the play might
have finished shortly after the ceremony but
for the necessity of playing out time with
bright dances and other incidentals. Gerard’s
nride is a convenient peg upon which to
hang a postponement of the kiss that unites
two loving hearts.
* * * *
“Betty,” holding this germ of a real story
in a riot of quick movement, sparkling music
and humorous dialogue, arrived at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s on Saturday night, and
was taken to the heart of a full audience.
The cast was one which could be guaranteed
with any sort of a chance to give good value.
Maud Fane won through as the shy kitchen-
maid, her work in the first act being very
appealing; the subsequent developments she
treated rather as if the story didn’t really
matter. Alfred Frith as Lord Playne, and
Cecil Kellaway as Jotte, a dressmaker, har-
vested most of the laughs. William
Senior (Earl of Beverley) pleased this Show-
man greatly: his work was easy and effec-
tive. Winnie Collins (as Estelle), Field
Fisher (Duke of Crowborough) and Hugh
Steyne (Hon. Victor Halifax) call most for
mention amongst the others, none of whose
knuckles demand rapping; and the acrobatic
“dances” of Cunningham and Hazel Clem-
ents were items which caused the theatre to
rock with sounds of approval.
* -i- * *
“Sally,” resurrected for the conclusion
of the '.Tosie Melville season, reappeared at
the Melbourne Royal on Saturday; and as
it was there for five months last year, it
w ? as quite at home. Also, it was at home
to a crowd which showed that its popularity
has not waned. “Sally” is popular for the
same reason that “Cinderella” is the favorite
story of young childhood; and Josie Mel-
ville makes that appeal to the heart which
goes with the Cinderella part. The theme,
of course, has been over-used; but “Sally,”
whilst she may wear gay costumes and mix
in costly revels, never ioses her human in-
terest amongst them, as many similarly ele-
vated ladies have done. .Tosie Melville, is
still winsome; George Vollaire rather insipid
as the wealthy young man who sees in the
humble dish-washer the girl of his dreams;
Dan Agar, the Duke of Czecligovinia, who
waits at the Alley Inn; and George Gee, the
theatrical agent, who deludes himself into
thinking that a tumultuous flow of language
and perpetual movement advertise him as
a live-wire. Gaston Mervale is a dignified
father to the book-writing son; and Hugh
Steyne provides a good sketch as the Admiral
Travers. This useful character-actor, by
the bye, is doing two jobs a night—he rushes
between this job in “Sally” and his other as
Victor Halifax in “Betty.” There is a dis-
tinct weakness in some of the minor parts,
but it is disguised in the general brightness
of the performance.
The Boucicault co. unpacked “The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray” at Melbourne King’s on
Saturday night, and found it in much the
same condition as when it was last shown
here. Irene Vanbrugh again achieved a
triumph of art over type in her impersona-
tion of the introspective lady with the awful
past whose gloomy reflections and yearnings
for a good woman’s love would better befit
46 than the 20-odd years allotted her by the
playwright. Boucicault showed Cayley
Drummle as a quieter and more lovable per-
sonality than in his former presentation.
C. M. Hallard is never really convincing as
Aubrey Tanqueray. Douglas Calderwood
has been successfully grafted on to the cast
as Captain Ardale, V.C., whose youthful in-
discretions spring suddenly from the past to
knock out the hope-for happy-ever-after end-
ing. The young man is acquiring a nice
stage understanding, but he still seems to
find his hands hard to discipline. Joan .Cross-
ley, as the undesirable Lady Orreyd, and
Pi'rie Bush, as her sottish young husband,
add to the gaiety of the performance; and
Janet Eccles is well in the picture as Mrs.
Tanqueray’s priggish stepdaughter, Ellean.
On Saturday night Mrs. Tanqueray and her
troubles will make way for “Mr. Pym,” who
will pass by for five nights.
At the Melbourne New Palace “Midnight
Frolics” still does it.
** # *
The closing-down of “Good Morning,
Dearie,” has given Melbourne Tivoli the
benefit of Hell’s Bells Jazz Band, which now
fills that showhouse with delirious riots of
sound. Misquette and Maxley, also not re-
quired in Josie Melville’s revival of “Sally,”
are appearing at the same address; and these
and the remarkable conjuring of Fclovis help
to place the present Tivoli bill on an excep-
tionally high step of the ladder.
“Cinderella,” at the New Princess’s, is due
after Saturday to drop the strenuous life of
two performances a day, limiting its
matinees to a couple per week. The co.,
which has kept wonderfully fresh under the
twice-a-day business prevailing since the
show started in Melbourne, must be glad that
the kids have gone back to school. Wonderful
houses have cheered the company on thus far
—when this Showman dropped in at a
matinee last week good money was being
turned away.
Ward Lyons, the Gappy Ricks of the
smart little show —all Australian except for
the play—with which the new Melbourne
Athenaeum opened, has received praise enough
to turn the head of almost any small-town
actor only just arrived in the city. The
policy which gives deserving Australian pro-
vincial-show actors a city appearance cer-
tainly deserves applause; and it is coming
nightly from big audiences.
The Newcastle Steelworks Band found it
profitable to extend its season at Wirtlis’
Olympia to eight nights; and it finished its
Melbourne appearances 1 on Sunday with two
performances at the Exhibition Oval. Its
itinerary takes it to Tasmania after appear-
ances at a couple of Vic. country towns then
the harmonious blacksmiths go to Maoriland.
Sydney will not have the chance of hearing
them until that tour is completed.

The popularity that Stilly and Mo have
established by their own special brand of
broad comedy was shown by the box-office
at the Melbourne Bijou being put out of a
job on Saturday, all seats having been sold
long before the show started. “The Sailors
was the brand put upon the initial offering;
but, after all, people don’t worry much about
the brand when they go to see Stiffy and
Mo. The pair have learnt the knack of fur-
nishing farce with an Australian accent, and
whilst the management, with an air of satis-
faction. makes up the returns in the office,
the pair get another sort of repayment in
storms of laughter.

“A.H.H.”: The story told by “Caesar’s
Ghost” (B. 29/l/’25) that Hugh Ward is
finding difficulty in securing new productions
is discounted, not only by the latest cables
from America published in the press, but
by earlier private advices from Ward him-
self. His late American bookings include
“Nono,” “Nanette,” “Lady, Be Good,” “The
Music Box,” “Little Jessie James” and
“Betty Lee,” and some time ago he secured
“Six-Cylinder Love,” which had a great run
in New York, “Abie’s Irish Rose” and “The
Nervous Wreck.” In view of the long run
assured to any good show in Australia—a
bright musical comedy is good for nine
months —and the comparative fewness of the
theatres, it is not so much a question of
finding shows as of being able to produce
them. For instance, “The Last Waltz,”
“Gabriel,” and “The Gipsy Princess,” which
Ward secured two years ago, have yet to
be staged here. Even if competition on the
part of Williamsons ran Ward short of new
musical comedies, he would find a way out.
His talent in this respect was shown when
he transformed “Tons of Money,” which in
Melbourne was an unsuccessful farce, into
a really bright musical comedy show in
Sydney.
“R.K.D.N.”: If Hugh Ward is really find-
ing it difficult to get new pieces abroad (B.
29/l/’25), it is the chance of a lifetime to
give local authors an opening. There are a
score of writers in Australia who could knock
up a scenario as good as that of Hugh’s
latest money-spinner, “Rosie O’Reilly.” As
for composers, Andrew McCunn, Willy Red-
stone, Alfred Hill, Victor Champion, Robert
Keers and others are capable of writing a
score that would put the song-and-dance
numbers of the average American musician
to shame.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Phillip Lytton is, of
course, behind the “Cappy Ricks” venture
at the Melbourne Athenaeum; it was from
his companies that the mummers were
selected. Nearly 25 years ago Lytton, then
a telegraphist whose wife was the graceful
actress Madge Hope, struck the idea of
forming a Players’ Club, to which the stage-
struck young people of a stage-struck period
rushed. Lytton found it profitable to de-
vote himself entirely to the work as instruc-
tor and manager, and reaped profits from
both fees and well-attended amateur per-
formances. How fashionable he became is
indicated by an early Bulletin notice:
“The jewels which glittered in the d.c. and
stalls of the Theatre Royal were worth
millions of pounds—if they were real.” Lyt-
ton was the first man in Australia to see the
possibilities of the “tent show” worked sys-
tematically ; and he shortly had several com-
panies travelling the country. He has made
a tidy pile out of the business.
“M.H.”: It is forgotten by a newer genera-
tion that George Peake, who recently retired
from his long-distance job as choir-master at
the Melbourne Collins-street Independent
Church —he was there for 45 years—was
conductor of the Melbourne Philharmonic in
its palmiest days. Under his baton he had
at one concert such soloists as Mrs. Palmer,
Miss Christie Fuller. A. H. Gee and Armes
Beaumont; Charles Santley sang “Elijah” at
the next and later in “The Messiah”; and
other artists included Ada Crossley, Marian
Burton, Belle Cole, Madame Albani, Dolores,
Clara Butt, Sir Charles Halle. Philip New-
bury, Kennerley Rumford and Andrew Black.
Nowadays the weakness of the society lies
in its soloists; and the thought of the ripe,
rich days of the past make the mouths of the
musically inclined water. Peake retired from
the position of conductor in 1911.
“Lew P.”; Lotus Thompson, who is
alleged to have poured acid over her legs in
the hope that TT.S. movie producers would
look higher for her beauty, is a Sydney girl.
r otus first came into the limelight at the
Hippodrome as a chorus-girl in the Fuller
pantomime “Mother Goose.” A press-agent
picked her out as the beauty of the show —
and Eve Gray was in it, too. Later she ran
away with a beauty contest, did a bit of
film work and appeared at a Sydney artists’
ball in a small leopard-skin and a frank
smile. In U.S.A. she started in Hal Roach’s
comedies, and when the last mail left Holly-
wood she was appearing in the Fox Sun-
shine comedies.
“Lud”: Arthur Roberts most certainly
was “difficult to play with” (B. 29/1 /’25).
especially when, in his own language, lie had
“been at the cruet.” The leading actress in
one of his shows had to join with the licensed
joker in a duet which she had grown to
detest on account of Arthur’s over-accentu-
ated fooling during her share of the number.
Roberts, of course, knew this, and one festive
evening he insisted, to the amazement of the
conductor, in taking four encores for the
duet which the audience had never given any
sign of wanting aghin after its first hearing.
“F.T.K.” : Peggy Pryde (B. 29/l/’25) first
appeared in Australia at Sydney Tivoli on
May 14, 1898. I well remember the occasion,
as it rained cats and dogs, and it was diffi-
cult to hear some of the turns. Rickards
gave her £6O a week, and the gallery helped
her earn it. She had three visits under
Harry’s management, the last being in April,
1911. A couple of years ago she returned
to Australia with a Digger husband and
settled down to domesticity in Paddington.
NOT A FIGURE-SPECIALIST.
“What a dreadful-looking child that little
McGilp is!”
“Yes, poor hid! But you must remember
that his father’s only a landscape
artist!”
“Hamfat” : The old Melbourne Athenaeum
Hall, on which a bright new theatre has been
grafted, is full of literary associations.
Marcus Clarke was secretary at one time, and
Garnet Walch at another. Max O’Rell,
Mark Twain, the Rev. Charles Clark and
Archibald Forbes lectured there, and it
yielded many a score of pounds to the robus-
tious Snazelle and the versatile Mel. B.
Spun*. A yarn told about the Marcus Clarke
regime by a very ancient Melbourne inhabi-
tant is that a caller inquiring for the erratic
writer was told that he had gone to lunch.
“Which bar does he lunch at usually?” asked
the inquirer. Marcus was nearly always
“out at lunch”; but that was the fashion
of the Athenaeum until a sterner secretariat
came in to put the club’s affairs in order.
“E.T.” : The oddest thing about Dickens
plays or, rather, stage versions of his books
(B. 29/l/’25), is the lingering tradition
that the novelist “did not dramatise well.”
This in spite of the fact that scores of
Dickens pieces have seen the footlights, and
some of them made fortunes for the stars
who appeared in them. Lotta Crabtree, the
American actress who died last year, had her
biggest success in a version of “The Old
Curiosity Shop,” which she played up and
down the U.S.A. Incidentally, she left more
money behind her than any other stage per-
former on record. George Fawcett Rowe,
CHROMATIC CRITICISM.
FIRST CAT: “I'm told his play is going to
be a great success .”
SECOND CAT: “Yes—sure! Even the leading
lady blushed when she read it.”
also of America, went round the world with
an adaptation of “David Copperfield.” llis
Micawber was his best-known, though he
sometimes doubled the part with Dan’l Peg-
go tty, as Beerbohm Tree did later on in Lon-
don. Similarly, Jennie Lee, the English
comedienne, played “Jo” all over the globe, and
never failed to impress the public, though
her version of “Bleak House” was in *lO
sense a masterpiece. “Scrooge” has helped to
keep Seymour Hicks in the limelight for
nearly 20 years, and for longer than that
Martin Harvey has toured England, Canada
and parts of the U.S.A. with “The Only Way,”
the most satisfactory dramatisation yet made
of “A Tale of Two Cities.” Australia may
yet see his incomparable Sydney Carton.
Dickens in his day was bowdlerised and
cruelly maltreated by stage hacks, but many
a good play has been —and can still be—
made out of his books by proper craftsmen.
“R.K.D.N.” : A mystifying announcement
appears on the programme of “Frasquita,”
the new Franz Lehar opera comique which,
acquired by the J. C. Williamson directors
some time ago, started a preliminary canter
at the Lyceum, Edinburgh, during Christ-
mas week. The announcement reads :
Rehearsed by Mr. Oscar Asche. Produced by Mr.
Robert Evett.
As a producer cannot produce unless he re-
hearses, and as a play is generally re-
hearsed by the producer, it looks as though
Oscar started on the job of producing and
didn’t see it through. Maybe his old feud
with J.C.W. is being continued on the other
side of the world.
“Hambone”: Sutton Vane is the only new
name among the authors of the plays to be
produced this year by the Sydney Reper-
torians. His “Outward Bound” might never
have seen the limelight if Vane and his wife,
both actors, had not been on the unemployed
list. Having £2OO in their bank, they hired
a small Hampstead playhouse and staged
the piece, with scenery painted by Vane him-
self. When the first night arrived they had
only £5O left. “Outward Bound” was an
immediate success; West End managers
rushed it. and the play, which Sydney is to
see, is still running in Britain and N’Yark.
“Hamer”: If Harry Lynch, at at 78, is not
the oldest showman in Australia, he can
surely claim the most distant first appear-
ance before an Australian audience. The
Lynch Family of Bellringers gave a show
in St. George’s Hall, Melbourne, in 1869.
They have returned many times in the course
of their restless world-wanderings (the co.,
of course, lias undergone changes during the
years), and Harry is in Melbourne now. He
and his brother Robert are the two survivors
of the original crowd, which entered the
business at a time when pleased diggers
might at any moment express appreciation in
nuggets.
“Hamfat”: Ed-mund Duggan is still trail-
ing his own dramatic company about
Australia. Recently the crowd met with a
motor accident at West Maitland (N.S.W.),
which was as big an advertisement as many
day-bills. Ed-mund, who has beefed lines on
every stage in Australia, large and small,
was at his zenith when William Anderson
served bellowdrama to an appreciative
public, with Eugenie Duggan (Mrs. Ander-
son) as his star. A kindly veteran, he is
one of the last survivors of the heavy ges-
tured and fruity-voiced school of his period.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The most agonising
experience of my thespian career occurred
when I once had to play in “East Lynne”
and also look after the front of the house.
An amateur, recently married to one
of the company, was billed as Barbara. It
was a town largely inhabited by pirates, who
tried to get in for nothing by suborn-
ing members of the audience to open
side-doors; and while I was getting
into my stage garments urgent calls
came from attendants at the front of
the house, and messages equally
urgent came from one of the dressing-
rooms, where Barbara, overcome with
stage fright, was having hysterics.
Upon my entreating Barbara to
answer her cue and go on to surprise
Archibald by her appearance, she
showed an inclination to weep on my
shoulder, a proceeding which added to
my worries a dread about complica-
tions with her husband. While this
was going on Archibald had used up
all his lines, and, not having his
unexpected visitor to speak to, was
wandering idiotically about the stage
asking himself such silly questions as
“I wonder what has become of Bar-
bara?” When the lady, having had
the tears wiped off her face, was finally
pushed on, he had to greet her with
an amazed exclamation. Yet the
audience didn’t seem to notice; the
only remark made to me about it was
by a matron who at breakfast next
morning confided: “I don’t think that
Archibald Carlyle was as good a man as he
made out. 1 fid you notice that, even when
lie was married to Lady Isabel, lie went
wandering all over the room thinking of
nothing hut Barbara?”
“Flaming Youth”: George Kensington,
stage-manager for the J.C.W. “Sally” co.,
is a native of Napier (M.L.). He had
some rough experiences with small touring
ventures in Massey’s islands before he found
his niche. A show he was with was one
fare short for its next train journey. A
derelict piano-case at the back of the theatre
gave an idea. Lots were drawn to see which
actor-r should travel inside the case in the
truck with which the obliging M.L. Rail-
way Department provided travelling cos.;
and the lot fell to the old man of the crowd,
who was consoled for his discomfort by being
given a couple of bottles of beer. Unfor-
tunately, a porter at the next station dis-
covered the trick; and, when he and his
mates insisted upon helping to unload the
co.’s goods, that piano-case came in for some
rough tumbling. When released the old man
was justly indignant. “By gad, sir !” he
said to the harassed manager, “I wouldn’t
do it again for less than a dozen bottles of
beeah.”
“Paree”: The prize for an advertisement
that will catch the attention of every possible
reader goes to one printed here in Paris
lately. The striking features of a coming
revue were announced simply:—
225 girls.
145 costumes.
“A.H.H.”: As the poet is dead, Will
Byron, transport manager for Fullers, can
have whatever limelight the following affords.
A bunch of vaudeville artists on the Fuller
circuit were bound for M.L., and a baritone
with sentimental leanings was chumming up
with a girl in the songandance line. There
was a heavy swell on, and both being good
sailors were enjoying the sea air on deck-
chairs side by side. “Reminds one of what
Byron said—‘Roll on, thou deep and dark
blue ocean, roll,’ ” said the man. The
sweet young thing shifted her chewing-gum
and raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Go
on!” she remarked brightly. “Did he say
that to you? All he said to me was, ‘Here's
yer ticket, kid. Hop it.’ ”
“F.L.H.”: So Francesca Duret has cap-
tured a Milan audience with a dazzling per-
formance of Lucia; and during the previous
year she had appeared in various Italian
opera houses with increasing success. Yet
it is only 18 months since the Victorian
vocalist left these parts, almost unknown;
and if she had stayed she would have had
Buckley’s chance of singing Lucia or any-
thing else in the J.C.W. Melba operas. One
of the great patrons of Australian art might
even have sent to the director a note about
her, too: “You are not to let So-and-so sing
on any account.”
THE LEADER OF OUR CHORUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Ye that praise the blackbird,
Ye that laud the thrush,
Ye that love the linnet
Singing in the hush,
Have ye heard our magpie
Warbling in the bush,
First of singing things
In the early morning;
Dewy gems adorning
Satin breast and wings?
Where the grasses shimmer,
Where the lance-lights fall,
Steals and sweeps his music
Penetrating all;
Rippling, rounded, radiant,
Mirthful, magical,
In the rose-red blush
Of the morning dewy,
When the bushmen coo-ee,
Riding through the bush.
Loved by many lovers
Thrush and linnet be;
Sung by many poets
Is their melody;
Who shall laud the magpie
And his minstrelsy—
Full, and rich, and bold,
When the dark has ended,
And he pours his splendid
Notes of liquid gold?
Now, beyond gainsaying,
Be it known to ye—
Ye who prize the lyrics
Poured from hedge and tree
By your Northern songsters,
Singing silverly—
Never yet did float
Such a wondrous sweetness
As the rich completeness
Of the magpie’s note.
Sweeter than your blackbird,
Softer than your thrush,
Lovelier than your linnet
Singing in the hush
Is our joyous songster
Warbling in the bush—
First of singing things
In the morning early,
When the dewdrops pearly
Gem his breast and wings.

THE “WEE MacGREGOR” PORTABLE PETROL DRAG SAW
will cut ten times as much wood as two men by hand.
Invaluable to Farmers clearing land, and can be used for other power purposes, pumping, feed cutting,
grinding, running circular saw, and other similar work.
CONSTRUCTION.—Frame built of hardwood, the cross members
being mortised into side frames to prevent wear and keep the
working parts in rigid position. The frame is of three-point
suspension, two points on the log, one on the ground. All working
parts of this machine, including engine, are placed on the frame
in such a manner that no part extends below the bottom of the
frame, which allows the machine to be slid over logs or loaded into
waggons without danger of breaking any of these parts.
POWER.—The motor is a 4-h.p. water-cooled type, two-cycle,
3|in. bore by 4in. stroke. Remarkably simple and easy to start.
Equipped with water-proof magneto. The engine has' self-oiling
connecting rod, and crank case is cast in one piece and reamed to
standard size.
IMPORTANT.—AII parts are machined to standard size and
interchangeable.
SAW HOLDER.—The saw holder is used exclusively on our
machine, and is a real time saver, and is superior to anything yet
devised for this purpose. No time lost in fixing; simply place saw
against saw-holder, tighten saw-hook bolt, and you are ready for
operation. This feature is exclusive with the “Wee MacGregor.’*
OPERATION. —The illustration shows the “Wee MacGregor” on
the log ready for operation. The saw is adaptable to any
position, and makes a true cut, no matter whether log is on a
side hill or on level ground. One man operates and moves it from
cut to cut in the log, while two men carry it anywhere.
Feed the “Wee MacGregor” with petrol,
water and oil, and it will keep up its
work hour after hour, day after day,
and never get that tired feeling.
The “Wee MacGregor” carries our guarantee, and
is manufactured in Australia.

This firm has made possible the use of electricity in beautifying
the home and in organizing the work of the Counting House; in
saving labour on the farm; in the successful navigation of the sea
and the air; in simplifying the extraction of minerals and commodi-
ties from the earth; in making transportation easier and more
dependable.
In. fact, wherever human activity has its place there will be
found electricity or its benefits. Westinghouse, by its contribu-
tion of labour and toil, has been unceasing in its endeavors to
improve by its inventions and products the dependability of
electricity as a power.
In arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia, Westinghouse will be
pleased to hear from firms interested in acting as distributors.

A Bundle of New Books.
The Company of Avalon, by F. Bligh Bond (Basil
Blackwell). Based on certain script revealed to
the author by alleged automatic writing like that
which made the base of a previous work, “The Gate
of Remembrance,” resulting in the discovery of
the Edgar Chapel at Glastonbury. The present worn
may, indeed, be regarded as a supplement to the
previous one, since it carries back the story of
the building and the builders of the great monastery
to other times. The human interest in the narrative
rests upon an assumption of the survival of human
personality and speculation upon the immediate
post-mortem state of the vast majority of souls.
Those who are theologically minded will find interest
in its pages.
The Plays of Turgenev, translated from the Russian
by M. S. Mandell, SI.A., Instructor in Russian at
Yale (Heinemann). Turgenev did not consider
himself much of a novelist, and this paper is
inclined to agree with him. Like Conrad, who
modelled himself largely on the Russian, he was
too preoccupied with atmosphere and character to
make a great playwright. Still, there is the same
charm of colloquial, yet stately, diction in his plays
as in his novels. His affinities were more French
than Slav; but with all his studied refinement he
cannot prevent the strange chaos of the Russian
soul from making menders and mountebanks of his
puppets. They talk and talk and fly into flaming
quarrels and talk again ; and achieve —nothing.
Bats, by Mark Hovell (John Bale). It is only
when the rat becomes host for the bubonic-plague-
carrying flea we realise what a menace he is to
human life. Otherwise there would be a sense of
that disproportion which is the root of humor in a
volume of 450 pages being devoted to so humble a
subject. Apart from the abundant information
given by the author as to the means of destroying
the rodent, he has some interesting notes on the rat
as a plague carrier. “In India the cases of plague
are almost entirely bubonic (affecting the glands),
a form of the disease which is rarely transmitted
from man to man, and which is almost invariably
produced by contact with the rat flea.” In India
alone, during 10 years, 6,473,704 persons died from
plague, and only two per cent, of the deaths were duo
to the lung variety—the only variety for which the
rat is not responsible.
The London Venture, by Michael Arlen (Heine-
mann). Dikran Ivonyoumdjian is the Armenian name
of the writer who, under the pen-name of Michael
Arlen, came into prominence at the age of 19 with
the publication of the book of which the present is
a new edition. As he remarks in a humorous pro-
fatorial note, out of consideration for readers he
has assumed a name by which they may refer to
him in the same manner at least twice running
When the future author was five, his parents brought
him to England, where he was educated in a public
school. Subsequently he went to Switzerland, out
returned to England and at the age of little over
17 was cast on his own resources. It was then nc
started to write, and became a journalistic free-
lance. “London Venture” is practically a book of
confessions, with adventures in imagination. It is a
bright, amusing and sometimes cynical satire.
Bolshevism and the West, by Bertrand Russell and
Scott Nearing (Allen and Unwin). This, with an
introductory note, is the report of a debate upon
the question whether the Soviet could be made
applicable to England, America and I ranee. It
peace and prosperity and progress can be maintained
in England and France, Belgium and the United
States, the Soviet form of government will never
fit. If, on the other hand, international war and
class war and hard times break down the fabric of
Western society, then the Soviet form will be
inevitable.” So says Mr. Nearing. But Mr. Russell
does not believe that a Western disruption would
lead to a Government at all analogous to that of
Soviet Russia, and bases his argument on the fact
that the two are at different stages of economic
development; also, there are religious, ethnic and
ethical differences as well.
Mr. Godly Beside Ilimself, by Gerald Bullett (John
Lane). It all happened on Monday and luesday.
For 20 years out of 42 John Godly had risen at
the same hour, reached his office at the same time,
»one through the same monotonous round with the
same punctilious care. This Monday morning when
he left home he was surcharged with a sense of
lost vouth and the eternal drabness of things. Be-
hind "him he left an amazed wife, in whom too, this
red-letter day was stirring a remote sense ot lost
springtimes and unrealised summers. At his oilice
John meets his typiste, and she is made the instru-
ment by which this sober-minded man of routine is
led on a most amazing pilgrimage, where he meets
vastly fantastic companions. To Mrs. Godly comes
also adventures, for a strange personality masquerad-
ing as her husband, bubbling with youth and demon-
strative affection, takes his place. On Tuesday
evening returns the authentic John. They had in
their phantasies- found youth and beauty and the
goodness of life. An original altogether fantastic
and impossible story, it still carries a human appeal.
Justice Walk, by Constance Smedley (Allen and
Unwin). When a middle-aged clerk of fixed habits,
a bachelor in condition and a Quaker in religion,
pitches his tent in the artists’ quarter of quaint old
Chelsea we expect a novel of temperamental con-
trasts. In this we are not disappointed, but the
clash is not on the sexual side—it is in the seeming
divergence of social and ethical outlooks. The
story is told in a series of letters to “Margaret”
addressed to her from Justice Walk in Chelsea by her
Quaker lover. The natural simplicity and kindly
nature of the city Philistine in the home of the
arts, with its easy-going, unconventional occupants,
wins him their affection, and a very pleasing little
romance is wrought.
One Year, by A. S. Yallack (Radcliffe Press). In
the form of a playlet in two acts the writer presents
a dramatic incident which in a foreword he declares
“has no moral” nor is meant to teach anything, but
“represents life.” The representation of life is in
the form of an allegory, the three principal characters
being women, one “with eyes in her heart,” another
“with eyes in her mind,” and the third “with eyes
in her sex.” The principal male character is a
man of high talent, bewitched by the eyes of the
sexual lady, and it is from the clutches of this siren
the eyes of heart and mind combine to bring him
to a true view. The scene is east in London, though
the play is published in Australia, but it is very
doubtful if anywhere an audience could be found to
sit out the long monologues. Mr. Vallack’s ladies
are very loquacious.
The White Monkey, by John Galswwthy (Heine-
mann). No trace of halting vigor or sign of slack-
ened hand can be found in this latest novel of Gals-
worthy’s. If it does not touch the high water-mark
of genius it is not far below it. The six years
that have elapsed since the close of the war have
been marked by psychical changes in men and
women’s attitude to life that have subtly altered
their whole outlook. In this novel we are brought face
to face with the conflicting values of the old and
the new schools. “ ‘They say the war killed senti-
ment,’ said Soames suddenly. ‘ls that true ?’ ‘ln
a way', yes, sir. We had so much reality that we
don’t want any more.’ ‘I don’t follow you.’ ‘I
meant that only reality really makes you feel. So
if you pretend there is no reality, you don’t have
to "feel. It answers awfully well, up to a point.’ ”
And it was at this point the modern philosophy of
life broke down. Michael Mont discovers that “we
emancipated people have got into the habit of think-
ing we’re the world. Well, we aren’t; we’re an
excrescence, small and noisy. We talk as if all
the old values and prejudices had gone ; but they’ve
no more gone, really, you know, than the rows of
villas and little grey houses.” And in the end, from
that little circle of the elect to whom sentiment
was “tosh” and pity “tripe,” Michael found him-
self a rebel when he came against the crisis in his
life. “Revolt sprang up in Michael with a whir
like a covey of partridges. It did matter that some
person or some principle outside oneself should be
more precious than oneself —it dashed well did.
Sentiment, then, wasn’t dead—nor faith, nor belief,
which were the same things. Faith, sentiment, belief,
bad gone underground, possibly, but they were
there.”

If he’s strenuously struggling with a -chromatic cough,
When over each suffocating, grappling paroxysm
do you stoop,

For ten to one he’s suffering from croup.

And find it somersaulting and looping the loop,
Call in a doctor, or the child’ll need a cask ;
For you can bet your sweet life he’s got croup,

and there. .. .E.R.R.; Insufficient interest... .B.H.
(Broken Hill): As poor as thrice-dumped tailings....
Gertrude E. M.: Not bad ; but not quite good enough.
Bellerive: The meterological lyric has all the old
charm:—
With overcoat or umbrella
You can wade through the rain,
But a plague is the wind
With its shrieking refrain.
The weather is changeful,
’Twill have its own way,
And one of its pranks
Is a wild, dusty day.
Carried for miles the
Huge dust clouds arise
Which turneth and blow
In pedestrians’ eyes.
The weather is changeful,
’Twill have its own way.
But give me the rain
Before a wild dufiv dov.

“Linklater”: Babinda (N.Q.) Licensing
Court recently established a record when it
dealt with 14 cases of sly-grog selling and
recorded a conviction in each case. The Gov-
ernment scored 1700 in fines. A young
Greek, formerly in the business himself, also
created a record; he secured the whole of
the evidence in his capacity as police agent.
* * * *
“Clerk”: The last pint has been served
over the counter of the old Commercial Hotel
at Clunes (Vic.). The pub was built in
1556, right in the track of the diggers, and
its owner, Jack Luckcraft, took money liter-
ally by the bucketful: on pay nights such a
roaring trade was done that the till was dis-
pensed with, and the money shot into two
buckets, one for coins, the other for notes.
* * * *
“Borom”: There is no reason why the
tea-plant of China, India or Ceylon—each
has its own variety—should not be grown
in this country on a large scale. Three
years ago I saw some plants of two of the
varieties growing in a garden near Hornsby
(N.S.W.), and since then the owner has
increased the number. All were grown
without the slightest difficulty, not requir-
ing attention of any sort, and in the soil
and atmosphere there they seem to flourish.
The same plants have also been cultivated
at Bundaberg and Mackay (N.Q.), where
they also did well, although in surroundings
totally different from those at Hornsby.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: A farmer will never be
stuck for an implement if he has the
materials to make one. Broom millet is now
being grown in C.Q. to some extent, and the
farmers, instead of buying expensive
machinery for threshing out the seed, have
contrived one of their own. Three-incli iron
spikes spaced about 2in. apart are placed in
a stout barrel about 2ft. in length, through
which the hurl is passed. The thing may be
worked by hand or by motor. One arrange-
ment consists of an old bicycle with the
tyre removed from the back wheel. A rope
belt works in the wheel and in a groove cut
around the barrel, and the power is supplied
by someone sitting on the seat of the bike
and pedalling.

“Dogger, Esq.” : Some “spec” builders in
Melbourne have introduced a new line in
salesmanship. Ordinary tenants give little
encouragement to prospective buyers of.
houses when they arrive to have a look
through, so these builders employ their own
tenants, installing one along with furniture
in every new crib. After a while along come
the possible buyers, and a circumspect word
or two about the comfort of the house and
a hope that it will not be sold over his head
brings the tenant a bonus from the owner
when the place is sold. The tenant then
packs up to repeat the game somewhere else.
Thus the floating population in Melbourne
is getting bigger than ever.
* * * *
“X2X”: An American geologist has
advanced the theory that when the oil-
bearing areas of the world have been drained
earthquakes likely to follow. Oil exists
in strata which are permeated with it, the
pressure from below causing it to gush forth
when the deposit is tapped. In most places
this pressure must equal thousands of tons
to the square inch, in addition to the origi-
nal pressure which has brought about, to-
gether with certain chemical reactions, the
formation of the oil in the first place. Hence
when a large area has been drained of oil
earth-movements are likely. In support of
the theory it is pointed out that since cer-
tain of the oilfields in Arkansas have been
worked out tremors have been numerous,
although never reported from there before.
* * * *
“Hamer” : One of the cherished rights of
the Vic. civil servant is that his salary is
impervious to garnishee orders; the idea
is that if his wages could be attacked so
could his pension, and the State would
suffer in dignity if its retired employees
were to fall into indigence. Recently a gar-
nishee order was issued upon the Electricity
Commission, and the Commission thought
the claim might as well be tested. Chief
Justice Irvine decided that, although the
Commission was a public service, it was
entitled to hold property on its own account
and to sue and be sued. Therefore, Bill
Smith, who is a laborer employed by the
Commission, is not the sacrosanct person
he would be if he was a direct servant of
George Rex, and the bill of the most plebeian
creditor is allowed to peck at him.
* * * *
“Machete”: South Aus. has made up its
rnind to test the water-supply which is said
to underlie the vast empty plains that stretch
from the N.T. border to the Trans, railway
line. Tenders are to be called for bores as
the sites are located, the Government supply-
ing the plant. Depots for spares, casings
and other oddments to be supplied by the
Government will be established, and the loca-
tions of bore-sites are to be available by the
end of the month in Adelaide, the closing
date for tenders being March 23. It will be
a stiff job, for wood and water will have
to be taken along with the plant. During
the arguments on the “dead heart of Aus-
tralia,” begun by Professor Griffiths Taylor,
there were practical folk with a knowledge
of the region who declared it only wanted
water to blossom into good pastoral country.
Once water is secured, tree-planting can
follow, and this kick-off may be the begin-
ning of big things.
* * * *
“K.”: For all that has been written to
the contrary, a certain historic conveyance
hasn’t quite disappeared from the roads. A
few days ago I met a travelling show in
the north-western district of N. S. Wales.
The shape of the leading vehicle roused my
interest; a closer inspection proved it to be
an authentic Cobb and Co. The gold letter-
ing of the three words and the supplementary
G.R. were still easily decipherable. In view
of the recent acquisition by the Federal Gov-
ernment of the last Cobb and Co. that plied
in Queensland as a relic of the older days I
am wondering if this item will be of any
interest to the would-be purchaser whose
offer of £l5O was turned down. If it is, and
he will communicate with me, I might be
able to make a deal for much less than that
on his behalf.

A Holiday of Holidays!
A Wonderful Motor Tour through the Paradise of the
South Seas.
The South Isand of New Zealand is the scenic
rainbow of the world, reflecting something of every
country’s peculiar beauty. Every haunting spot in
this wonderful island is reached by a network of
luxurious motor services, picturesquely named the
White Star Tourist Services, Ltd. Sympathetic
experts in tourist comfort have chosen every car
used by this great organisation, so that a uniform
standard of smooth, dependable motoring is main-
tained throughout. Moreover, on whatever route
you choose lie hotels specially recommended for
their warm hospitality, excellent cuisine and com-
plete comfort.
From the day you set foot in New Zealand men
of the White’ Star will make you a friend among
friends. You will go from host to host a perfectly-
cared-for guest. You will penetrate the mysteries
of the Southern Alps, tall ghosts with a tenderness
for mists. In the heart of this fascinating region
is the famous Mount Cook Hermitage, an all-tlie-
year-round centre of happiness and frolic, and
mountain adventure. You will go to the shores of
lakes and fiords more beautiful even than those of
Europe, where launch trips are run under the
shadows of craggy steeps, and there is fishing, end-
less sunshine and beauty. You can go deer-hunting
among luxuriously-clad mountain ranges. You
can visit marble mountains and skirt the bush-clad
shores of the blue Pacific.
Yes, come! Here is romance and happiness and
nature more beautiful and magnificent than you
have pictured her.
You will tear yourself away bubbling over with
renewed health and spirits and with a store of
unforgettable memories.
Yet the moderate cost of this holiday of holidays is
one of its biggest surprises.

booklet to the Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or
Brisbane branch of the N.Z. Govt. Tourist Bureau,

Captain Forest, the Speck’s best-known
seascape painter, just failed to top the cen-
tury. He died at his daughter’s residence a«,
Melton Mowbray the other day at 99^.
“The Deacon” : Archbishop James Duliig,
of Brisbane, is a voice uplifted these days
in favor of the Italian influx into the north-
ern State. He is an Irishman that Australia
caught young. As a young butcher s clerk,
his handwriting attracted the attention or
Archbishop Dunne, who sent him to the Col-
lege of the Propaganda in Rome, where he
studied the Dago in his native lairs.
“Fana”: Regarding the appearance in
other countries of Australian place-names
(B. 22/l/’25), in California there is a
Bendigo and a Ballarat. Both are no doubt
relics of the goldmining days. In Southern
California there is a Leura, which I thought
always to be an Australian aboriginal name.
It is perhaps a coincidence that the neighbor-
hood is thick with tall eucalyptus trees.
Thomas Pitman, who recently died, aged 90,
at Norwood (S.A.), was a cousin of the late
Sir Isaac, who invented shorthand and made
Hansard possible, and of Jacob Pitman,
who constructed many of Adelaide’s early
buildings. Tom arrived from Wiltshire, Eng-
land, in 1840, when six years _of age,
and became a builder too. With John
Crocker he built the overland telegraph sta-
tion at Port Darwin in 1871.
Of course they blame Margot for the
Earldom (of Oxford) that has been given
to Asquith; but most of them come to it
sooner or later. Arthur Balfour has no
Margot; yet he couldn’t resist at last. Really,
however, there is no reason why these men
shouldn’t take titles if they want them. The
absurd thing, in which the public is deeply
interested, is that these people’s descendants
to the 97tli generation should be the coun-
try’s lawmakers.
After over 40 years' sin-shifting among the
turbulent miners of the northern (N.S.W.)
coalfields, Hugh Cullen has reported at Head-
quarters. A Kilkenny native, he entered up
at the local priest-producing institution of
St. Keiran’s, Cardinal Moran’s white-haired
college. Brought to Australia, Father Cullen,
a real man, soon made good among his flock,
and when ’flu was ravaging the fields put in
very fine work that knew no creed.
Kyneton (Vie.) gave a fine reception to
Dr. Argyle, State Chief Sec., when he went
up to take part in the back-to-the-old-town
movement. It was Hospital Sunday, and he
made his native heath a platform to broad-
cast views of general interest to the State.
Fifty-eight years ago Argyle saw the light
at the stronghold of the family, Rock House,
overlooking the Kyneton racecourse. The
place has since passed into the hands of the
Locke family, who took it over from the
Mackays.
One of the last of Fiji’s old identities went
out suddenly at Auckland lately, when J. B.
Turner made it a day, aged 75. He was a
member of the combined naval and civilian
expedition which, in 1870, attempted to
avenge the murder of Speers and Macintosh,
an event that decided the annexation of the
group by Britain. When the agitation for
non-official representation on the Fijian
Council was raised, Turner interviewed the
Secretary for the Colonies and gained the
point, and was himself made the first repre-
sentative of “outside” interests. He made
money in planting, did much for Fijian stock-
breeding, and was Suva’s many-times Mayor.
The wind-up of the A.I.F. Canteen Fund,
which Jias been distributing amongst necessi-
tous Diggers and their dependants the pro-
• fits made by the canteens during the war,
will put Nicholas Lockyer finally out of a
job. Chief of the N.S.W. Customs when
Federation came, Lockyer went over to the
Commonwealth, and became Comptroller-
General of Customs in 1911. Later he was
a member of the Inter-State Commission;
but at the end of the war he was given
leave to organise (Repatriation activities.
Being of retiring age in 1920, he left the
Commonwealth service, but kept to his
honorary job as chairman of the Canteen
Fund. Now that goes, too.
“Borom”: Despite the vigilance of Cus-
toms and police spirits are still illicitly
distilled within easy distance of Sydney.
Most of it is manufactured in the bush
around the small towns within a 30- or
40-mile radius; the industry thrives best in
the Hawkesbury district. The stills are
generally so well planted and well guarded
that there is little danger of their being
raided unless the standing offer of a hundred
pounds reward tempts somebody to turn in-
former. Mostly the stuff is brought into the
city by motors in petrol tins. It is too fiery
for the palate of even the most hardened
drinker, and such publicans as vend it are
obliged to mix it with cheap bulk whisky
bought for the purpose.
“Gartot”: It is inconceivable that when
Cook applied the name “New South Wales”
to the eastern shore of Australia he knew
of any other coastline similarly christened
(B. 22/l/’25). Cook had seen some ser-
vice in North American waters, and had the
other “New South Wales” been in anything
approaching general use, he would have
known of it. It must be remembered that
geographical coastal names have been
standardised for us only since the British
Admiralty began to undertake hydrographic
surveys; before that a place might have half
a dozen names, bestowed by navigators of
different nationalities. The Hudson Bay
coast was little known 150 years ago, and
every maritime nation whose ships had
visited it probably possessed an assortment
of charts with a variety of nomenclature.
“Half-Butt”: Among all the things, neces-
sities as well as so-called luxuries, I am
called upon to pay money for, I can only
think of one that hasn’t soared in price
since pre-war days. The charge for a game
of billiards or snooker remains what it was.
This is the more notable because nothing
has appreciated in value so much as sport-
ing materials, cricket-bats, tennis-racquets,
golf-clubs and the like, and, presumably, it
is the same with billiard-cues and -cloths.
Were all billiard-saloons profiteering before
money began to shrink in purchasing-power
that they have been able to worry along
without putting up their tariff? And what
of the hotels and clubs which charge far
more for everything they supply to-day ex-
cept the right of knocking colored balls about
a table with a stick?

Fight that Film
That’s what keeps your teeth so cloudy
Do you know that dentists all the world
over now advise a new method of teeth
cleaning ? And that millions of people now
use it? It combats the film —those dingy
coats, the cause of most tooth troubles.
This off errs you a io-Day test, and we urge
that you accept it.
Means added beauty
Teeth are clouded by a film—that vis-
cous film you feel. Much of it resists the
tooth brush, clings and stays. Then it
forms dingy coats, and teeth lose their
lustre.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the acid
in contact with the teeth to cause decay. It
breeds millions of germs, and they, with
tartar, are the chief cause of pyorrhea. Very
few people, in the old d'ays, escaped
troubles caused by film.
Protect the Enamel
Pepsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use
a film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

Now they fight it
Dental science, after long research, has
found two ways to fight that film. One acts
to disintegrate the film at all stages of for-
mation. The other removes it without
harmful scouring.
A new-type tooth paste has been created
to apply those methods daily. The name is
Pepsodent. Careful people of some fifty
nations now use it, largely by dental advice.
Some old mistakes
Old ways of teeth cleaning reduced the
alkalinity of the saliva. They reduced its
starch digestant. And those are the factors
on which Nature depends to fight acids
and starch deposits. Pepsodent multiplies
that alkalinity, multiplies that starch diges-
tant. So every use gives manifold power to
these protective agents.
These things mean a new dental era.
They mean much to you and yours. So
we urge you to prove them out.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
AMONGST the gentlemen of Portland-
lane who helped distressed fellow-
citizens with loans “without pub-
licity or registration” existed a spirit of
camaraderie born of racial affinity and
fostered of necessity. For is not the money-
lender fair game to the crooks of a great
c 'ityV Hence the finance companies ex
change weekly lists, comprising the names
°f their clients and the nature of the secu-
rities held for advances made.
But Louis Goldberg, of the Atlas Com-
pany, had one great aversion in the Lane
an interloper to whom he denied the accepted
courtesies of the trade. The Empire Loan
Company, otherwise Denis Regan, was an
outsider—a low-mouthed Gentile, who should
be wielding a pick and shovel rather than
trespassing on the preserves of the children
of Israel. An Irish money-lender! lhc
thing was a contradiction in terms; for were
Pot the Irish, with their improvidence and
irresponsibility, specially crestted to borrow
Pioney’ And yet here was one lending it at
GO per cent.!
The enmity was mutual. Regan got on
Mil enough with most of the financiers ot
the Lane; but that Goldberg—always on the
front doorstep like a black spider, stealing
other people’s customers, coaxing them away
Mth promises of lower interest, slandering
his competitors! Some day he would get
Men with him!
One dav Louis discovered that a customer
°f his called on a Saturday morning, lrue
to the faith of its “manager,” the office of
the Atlas Company was always closed on
Saturday. Louis knew that some day
how he dreaded the thought of that day
Mien Justice was being meted out by the
God of his Fathers, this one great sacrifice
for his faith would be counted unto him as
righteousness. But for a dirty Irishman to
take advantage of that faith ! .
Regan had seen the customer l ea yi n » “ s
rival's office, had inveigled him to the Em-
pire Loan Company and pulled olf a pront-
able bill of sale on the fittings and good-
will of a restaurant. . ~
On the Monday afternoon “The
was honored with a visit from ‘The Atlas.
“What you steal my gustomers tor/ de-
manded Louis. , „ ,
“Go and choke yourself with Kosher
P or k!” i, v
“You haf no religion, and you steal! xou
tief! You steal my client.”
“Get out of this, you ould sou ot bolo-
mon ! Go home, Isaac !”
“You—you—Paddy Regan!”
“Don’t you call me Paddy! My name s
Denis —Denis Regan.” ,
“And don’t you call me Isaac. My name s
Louis —Louis Goldberg.”
“Don’t believe you, Louis. If ever there
was an Isaac, you’re it.” ,
“And if ever a pig there was, you re it.
Paddy’s pig!” , . . ,
And so the war waged till each had ex-
hausted his limited vocabulary and Louis
had left vowing that he would soon square
the account.
The opportunity came sooner than he ex-
pected. A few days later Louis noticed a
man gaffing at the highly-polished brass-
plate of the Atlas Company.
“You look for somebody?” Louis asked.
“I do. I want somebody to help me
straighten up a damned scoundrel who’s
bleeding the last shilling out of me.”
“What’s his name, eh?”
“Regan—a bloodthirsty Irish Jew.”
“There ain’dt no such thing, my vriendt,
as an Irish Jew. But I know that Regan.
Come inside and we will have a quiet liddle
Once inside Louis beamed with amiability.
He even produced a box of cigars and urged
his visitor to light up.
“Now tell me all about it.” ■
“Well, it’s this way. I'm to get £l5OO
from my old man’s will-—John Henderson
he was —when the estate is wound up. All
Regan would lend me on it was £lOO. One
hundred —on a security worth £l5O0 —for six
months, with £7O interest added!”
“Seventy pounds,” murmured Louis dream-
ily. “Seventy on a hundred for six months!
Why, that’s one hundred and forty per
cent.!” , .
“Don't I know that! But the six months
is up, and he threatens to foreclose. In less
than six months the estate will be divided
and my £l5OO will be gone for a hundred !
“But lie must aggoundt for the balance
if he sells,” said Louis.
“Account! Yes, he’ll account, I don t
think. He’ll sell to a dummy, who’ll sell
to another. By the time I chase up to the
last one. that hundred will have grown into
five hundred. He’s got me beat.”
“Haf you a copy of the will?”
“Here it is,” replied the victim, “and a
list of the assets of the estate.”
Louis carefully read the documents and
showed signs of intense interest. “Did
Regan check these papers, make searches,
give notices, do everything in order?”
“He did, the old screw. Took a week to
make up his mind about it.”
“Supposing I take it over from him, eh?
Pay him off, and you become my client, eh ? '
“Anything to get out of his hands.”
“And you will sign for a little eggstra for
my saving you? Eh?”
“I can’t get a worse deal from you.”
“Much better, my vriendt. much better.
Ven I collect the £l5OO I vill pay you the
fair balance. I vill, honest.”
There was an hour’s busy writing in the
office, preparing assignments, notices and
other documents. It was risky taking the
security over without making his own in-
vestigations, but Regan never made a mis-
take over that kind of security, and there
wasn’t a moment to lose. Fifteen hundred
pounds to handle in six months! It was
worth a slight risk. , , ,
A little later Denis Regan looked up from
his desk and saw his enemy before him
trembling with excitement.
“Didn’t I tell you to keep out of my
office?” he demanded. .
“I am come on business.”
“I’ll have no business with you. Get out.
“I demand from you your security in the
will of John Henderson. Here is your money
tendered by law.”
“You’ve been tampering with one of my
clients!” thundered Denis.
“Well, you stole my restaurant-keeper. Eh /
Don’t that square us?”
“You sneaking little Hebrew! Get out of
this.”
Louis sat down without invitation and
waited till the storm of vituperation abated.
With authority to take over the security in
his possession words did not matter; but
at last he got in a reply.
“Here is your money. Here is my second
mortgage and my authority to take over the
first. Hand over, Paddy, and sing your low
Irish songs after I go back to a respectable
office.”
“You can go to Hell!” retorted Regan. .
“Very well; to-morrow I start a suit m
Equity, and you pay the costs. I can afford
to wait.” „ , , _
“Show me your papers,” snarled Regan.
For a full fifteen minutes he examined them,
and then opened his safe.
“All right,” he said. time. Isaac;
but my day will come again. You’ll be sorry
for this day’s work. Mark my words, now —
you’ll be damned sorry some day.”
“Some day,” retorted Louis, as he signed a
receipt for the documents. “Some day is no
account. To-day, Paddy, to-day, is nice and
bright and warm. Eh?”. And for the_ first
time since his arrival in the lane Louis
laughed aloud. At the door he turned for
one parting shot. “You go dig potatoes with
your brothers, you Irish!”
At exactly four o'clock the next afternoon
Louis Goldberg, almost unconscious was
crumpled up in his chair staring at a letter
which had just arrived: —
The Trustees of the Estate of John Henderson
cannot take cognisance of your notice of assignment
of the interest of James Henderstm. By a codicil
to his will the testator declared that. if James
Henderson attempted to mortgage, sell, or m any way
pledge his interest in the estate., such interest, should
cease and determine and fall into the residuary.

POISONED WOUNDS. — “My little
finger was crushed by a log and split open to
the bone. Though I applied hot fomenta-
tions it swelled to twice the size. I was per-
suaded to try Zam-Buk, which quickly drew
out all inflammation and corruption. Thanks
to Zam-Buk the finger healed perectly.”—
Mr. W. Simpson, Annerly Road, Brisbane.
ULCERATED LEGS. — “Through long
suffering and continuous standing I began to
suffer severely from varicose trouble. Large
swollen lumps appeared in my legs and later
on the veins burst. Friends urged me to go
into hospital, but I made up my mind to
treat myself with Zam-Buk, and fortunately
it gave splendid results. Zam-Buk quickly
reduced all soreness and swelling, and healed
the sore part.”—Mrs. Messervy, of 74 High-
sted Road, Pananui, Christchurch, N.Z.
SCALDS. —“WhiIe reaching for a kettle
of boiling water off the stove I slipped, and
the contents scalded my foot. The skin was
badly blistered, the burning irritation was
terrible. My mother dressed the parts with
Zam-Buk. This balm took out the fiery heat
and pain, and in two weeks healed the foot
beautifully.”—Miss E. Tait, 31 Lock Street,
Ballarat, Vic.
CUTS AND SCRATCHES. —. “Whilst
washing clothes a poisonous dye got into a
scratch on my hand. My arm became
swollen, and was full of pain and inflamma-
tion. It was on a friend’s strong recommen-
dation that 1 began to use Zam-Buk. It
brought wonderful ease, and as I kept on
with the dressings all swelling and inflam-
mation was rapidly overcome, and my arm
and hand were restored to normal size.” —
Mrs. F. Walters, of 214 Bathurst Street,
Hobart, Tas.
PIMPLES AND FACE SORES.—
“My little girl’s face was awfully disfigured
by nasty sores which discharged and formed
into crusts. Zam-Buk drew out all bad matter
from the sores, brought the crusts away and
left clear, healthy skin underneath.” —Mr. G.
Wylie, O’Connell Street, Newtown, Sydney.
PRICKLY HEAT.— “Last summer my
skin got into a fearful state with prickly
heat,” writes Mrs. E. Cook, of Kennedy
Terrace, Brisbane. “It was almost impossible
to keep my hands away from the burning,
itchy surfaces. On a friend’s advice I applied
■it
a dressing of Zam-Buk. Its soothing, cool-
ing sensation was really amazing. More Zam-
Buk soon dried up the eruption and replaced
the bad surfaces with a splendid growth of
smooth healthy skin.”

He saw it all now. A plant! Denis Regan
had missed the codicil and passed on a dud
security! Then the telephone rang. He felt
sure it was Regan, but luulu t the energy to
answer it, or the courage to listen to the
jeers of the victor. Great tears worked down
the seams of his face, as lie sat there staring
into space, monotonously repeating the
amount of his loss. “Vun hundred and
twenty-five! Vun hundred and twenty-five!”
* * * *
For weeks Louis brooded on the ease with
which his enemy had duped him, and at times
became frantic at the open jeering to which
he was subjected. Only that morning Regan
had passed, or should have passed, his office.
But he could never resist the temptation of
a word with that dejected figure on the front
step of No. 2(i.
“Hallo, Louis,” he said, with exaggerated
geniality. “Got any money to lend on wills?”
“You go on, Paddy, to your sty. You
block my front door and I call the bolice.”
“I believe you’re lending sixpences now to
kids, and taking bills of sale over their milk
jugs?”
“Maybe. I don’t lend shillings to street
vimmeu and take seguridy on their clothes,”
was the polite retort.
“Bye bye, Isaac. Come along any time
when business is dull. I always have a few
crook accounts to transfer.”
“And tings in your safe you stole, you
great tief!” shrilled the now thoroughly ex-
cited manager as he hurried back into his
inner office. “If I could only catch him
once, just once,” he muttered, and settled
down to a re-scheduling - of his securities.
For weeks this Irish rival had haunted
him, in business hours, in sleep, in moments
of idle meditation, but there seemed no way
of revenge.
When there .was nothing to do in the
office Louis spent much of his time gazing
at a ring which never left his finger. It was
his only adornment, a magnificent cluster
of diamonds, in a striking setting, that
always attracted notice. It wasn’t that he
loved jewellery. But with the fear of ruin
always before him he kept it as an asset
which might some day save him from starva-
tion. It was the same morbid instinct which
makes many old women keep a sum of money
in the bank to pay for their burial. To hold
£5OO worth of property bringing in no inter-
est seemed improvident, but some day, if he
lost all his money.... !
One morning a rumor went down the
Lane that the Atlas Company had lost its
diamond ring. The manager was seen on
the doorstep excitedly talking to police
officers. Even Regan came along to enjoy
the sensation.
“Serve you right, Isaac,” he called out.
“I offered to mind it for you.”
“Perhaps you return it! Eh? Vas you
in my office yesterday, eh? Veil I vas asleep?”
“You never sleep, Isaac. One eye is
always watching your seguridies,” retorted
the grinning Irishman.
A few days afterwards a shabby little
man crept furtively into Regan’s inner
room and closed the door.
“Well, my man, and what may your
trouble be?” asked Regan.
By way of answer the visitor displayed
a magnificent ring in the palm of his hand.
“By the holy saints, where did you get
that?” said Regan, eagerly reaching for the
treasure.
The little man closed his hand and sat
lown.
“Never you mind where I got it,” he
replied. “Will you buy? It’s worth a thou-
sand.”
“Can’t buy without knowing where you
got it.”
“Then someone else will —without asking
questions. Good day.”
"Don’t be in such a hurry. Let me
!w it again.”
Once more the ring—Louis Goldberg’s ring
without a doubt —glittered in the open palm.
But there was a table between the man in
possession and him who coveted.
“I’ll give you fifty for it,” said Regan,
‘and ask no further questions.”
No, you won’t. Two hundred or nothing.”
“I know the man who owns that ring.”
"Well, I don’t know him and don’t want
to know anything about him. I’m selling
for a friend.”
“Supposing I ring up the police.”
“But you won’t.”
“And why won’t I?”
“It wouldn’t be safe. I always carry a
little persuader with me,” and the stranger's
empty hand moved ominously to his hip-
pocket.
“I was only joking,” came the hasty reply.
“Well, don’t joke with me. I want that
two hundred to-day.”
“I’ll go a hundred and fifty.”
“You won’t. Two hundred or nothing.”
Regan’s safe was at the side of the table.
He never turned his back to anyone when
its door was unlocked. So with a wary eye
on the vendor he extracted £2OO in notes,
and three minutes later was gloating over
his bargain. The diamonds, sold separately,
would bring a certain £5OO.
Next morning he stopped again to greet
his enemy, who was actually whistling!
“Been selling off the widow’s sewing-
machine?” he inquired genially.
“No.” said Louis, “but I find something
again,” and he ostentatiously waved a hand
on one finger of which glittered a ring, the
exact replica of the one in Regan’s safe.
Regan’s usually florid complexion faded
to a sickly grey as he stammered: “Where
.. . .where... .did you find it?”
“I find it with der Henderson will papers,
wrap up with vun hundred pounds in notes!”
was the triumphant retort.

The Short Bamboo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ A WHIPPING with the short bamboo,”
/-A said the magistrate, sitting back
and fanning himself with an air
of extreme boredom.
The prisoner smiled. Ming Yet was an
actor —one of the proscribed classes, the
ukase against whom is so strict that not
until the third generation can any member
of the family sit for the civil examinations
at Peking. But that did not worry Ming.
An actor, all he craved was an audience;
and here was one, ready made, as it were,
anxious to see what was to be seen. Ming’s
crime was not serious—a mere petty theft.
And the punishment Ming regarded as a
joke, a sort of light comedy staged to tickle
the fancy of the onlookers. Ming knew all
about the whipping with the short bamboo.
He had often watched others undergoing
the punishment. A stick not as thick as
his finger and a mere eighteen inches in
length, it was never raised higher than a
foot above the prisoner’s body. To desig-
nate as punishment such foolish by-play w r as
just so much tomfoolery; one of the Law’s
little jokes.
The opening phase of the punishment was
the worst, and to his chagrin Ming had
quite overlooked it. There was nothing
delicate about the operation. Before Ming
realised what was happening the official
flagellator had pulled down his baggy trous-
ers in full view of the grinning audience,
and toppled him over flat on his stomach.
Ming was not finical, but several seconds
elapsed before the sniggers of the audience
lost their significance.
The first tap of the cane called him to
attention.
Squatted cross-legged beside the prisoner,
the whipper commenced his tattoo. Never
once did lie raise the cane more than a foot,
and as regular as clockwork he struck twice
to the second. Ming was tickled. The fii’st
flush of embarrassment over, he was enjoy-
ing himself and making the most of the
situation. He had his reputation as a wit
to maintain. On the morrow he would pro-
bably be performing for cash before this self-
same audience. Lying with his face rest-
ing on one cheek, lie smirked and winked at
the onlookers, intimating by his every look
that he was going through this farce for
their special entertainment. And all the
time the whipping continued. Not by a
fraction of a second did the timing of the
blows vary, and not by a hairsbreadth did
the second stroke deviate from the line of
the first. Had he a chalk line to guide him
the whipper could not have struck more
accurately. There was no force in the
strokes; barely sufficient to squash a fly.
But the constant dripping of water will
wear away a stone, and those strokes fell
two to the second, one hundred and twenty
to the minute, and Ming’s anatomy was
not of stone. At the end of three minutes
Ming began to have misgivings, and would
dearly have loved to turn over. But there
was the audience and his. reputation as a
wit to be thought of. So lie continued smil-
ing. But, somehow, his smiles and his
thoughts would get mixed up, and at some
of his thoughts he forgot to smile. At such
times it was only the guffaws of the audi-
ence that saved the situation for Ming, when
he would screw a smile into his rueful coun-
tenance, at sight of which the audience
would but laugii the louder.
The whipping went on. The straight red
welt across Ming’s buttock was rapidly
changing to a nasty blue, and to Ming’s
flitting imagination seemed raised to the
dimensions of a broomstick. When watch-
ing the performance Ming had always
thought that the agonised look which eventu-
ally crept into the face of the prisoner was
but so much acting; a playing up to the
magistrate to secure the suspension of the
farce. But he was rapidly learning better.
Also, he was forgetting to smile. There
were whole seconds, while he counted the
strokes, when he forgot to smile at all!
Ten minutes of whipping was the least he
could hope for, and before five had gone he
would have given his trousers for a look
at a watch. One-two, one-two, one-two,
the blows continued until it seemed useless
Ming’s trying to count them. Of their own
volition, born of themselves, little noises
crept up into his throat, causing him to shut
his teeth hard to prevent their escape. He
no longer smiled. Not for the life of him
could he see anything in life to smile at.
The tang had suddenly gone out of exist-
ence. The audience still smiled; some irre-
ligious members even laughed outright. Rut
they and Ming were viewing life from dif-
ferent angles just then. They knew no-
thing of the innumerable little vnri-colored
dots which danced before Ming’s eyes, each
stroke of the cane producing a new one,
until Ming had a whole constellation of
dots all to himself. Neither did they know
or care that the blue welt across Ming’s
buttock had changed to black, with beauti-
ful yellow and mauve, trimmings, and that
the mashed skin was liable to break at any
moment. But Ming knew. The sledge-
hammer-like blows of the cane told him so.
Not by a fraction of an ounce had the
weight of those blows increased since the
first stroke, but had a Vulcan been wield-
ing the bamboo Ming could not have felt
the strokes more. A thousand to the second
they seemed to strike him, each one heavier
than its predecessor. The pain maddened
Ming.
Flesh and blood could stand it no longer.
Throwing to the winds the last little shred
of his sany-froid, he lurched aside, deter-
mined to rise, only to find that two men held
his hands while two more perched upon his
feet. Lost in the maze of blows and his
futile efforts to count them, he had not
noticed their approach. He w r as impotent.
Squirming, writhing, wriggling his body like
a 'shake, lie tried in vain to shift the venue
of the blows, but not by a hairsbreadth did
they deviate from the savage welt across
his body. The skin broke. Blood ran down
over him and splashed over the whipper at
every stroke, but the cane still fell one hun-
dred and twenty strokes to the minute, and
the magistrate still sat fanning himself at
the head of the room.
Ming was screaming now, and impotently
beating his face upon the floor. He was
no longer the actor. There was no audience.
He was the only being on earth. He and
the Fiend who crouched by his side wield-
ing the flail which was slowly cutting him
to shreds.
* * * *
When Ming regained consciousness he was
lying in a pool of water, and water, carelessly
thrown to revive him, saturated his cloth-
ing. The whipping was ended. His clothes
had been readjusted. Nothing remained but
for Ming to make his exit before the audi-
ence he certainly would not attempt to en-
tertain for cash on the morrow.
