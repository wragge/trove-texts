known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced.their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hij
patients, he has during his pi’actice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind. (

been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.

reigning in Victoria will go before the
country, and whether it will come back with
a strong majority or fail to come back at all
is at present a matter of some conjecture.
There are no reliable signs either way ; to
all appearance the entire province is sitting
on a rail and waiting with an almost entire
absence of enthusiasm for the result, pre-
pared to accept it with equanimity, whatever
it may be. The Shiels Cabinet came into
power almost entirely by accident, and it
has had little chance, so far, to show its real
capacity. The two Cabinets which preceded
it were also, more or less, accidental. Gillies
obtained the Premiership because of Ser-
vice’s retirement and Berry’s appointment
of himself to be Agent-General in London.
The country showed no definite signs of
wanting Gillies, and never appointed him
to his high office—it merely accepted him as
a painful fact, and the situation grew upon
him, in a manner of speaking, like moss or
any other excrescence. Munro obtained the
leadership of the Opposition because the
party had never seen him in office, but im-
agined from his wooden aspect and hardness
of expression that he couldn’t be worse than
Bent, whom it had seen; and he inherited the
shoes of the man of “ recoups.” The country
never expressed its confidence in Munro at
a general election, and he fled from the
scene before it had a chance to do so, there-
fore he also might be fairly classed as an
accident. When he formed his Cabinet he
adhered strictly to untried men. Ihe few
old office-holders surviving among his party
had mostly proved themselves so exceedingly
foolish that he preferred to distribute the
portfolios among men who had had no chance
to exhibit whatever foolishness they might
possess. The abject dullness of Victorian
politics in the days of the Coalition, when
the whole science of Government was to
hang on and promise new railways, gave
no scope for genius, and in that utterly
dreary Legislature Demosthenes and John
Nimmo would have stood very much on a
level—the latter because he couldn’t speak,
and the former because he had practically
nothing to speak about. Therefore, Munro,
having few' brilliant men to choose from, and
being utterly incapable of recognising
brilliance in any case, followed the safe rule
of choosing such colleagues as had not yet
been found out too conspicuously, and when
he escaped to England amid a chaos of
bursting banks and financial disasters his
colleagues scrambled for his billet, and
Shiels got it. The country never definitely
demanded Shiels any more than it
did Munuo or Gillies; in fact, the
province, for nine years past, has never
expressed itself very definitely about any-
thing.
* * #
Therefore, when Graham Berry re-
appeared on the scene, he came with an
obvious resolution to brush away this new
politician, and assume, by a species of divine
right, Ins. old position at the head of the
State. Excepting Shiels, there was no one
in the way. Service was old, worn-out, a
Tory, and not desirous of office. Gillies,
who was desirous of office—who, in fact,
would gladly absorb forty offices—had fallen
with a crash into obscurity. Deakin, from
whom the democracy once expected much,
had been for eight years eternally on the
verge of doing something, and yet never had
done anything; either the incubus of Gillies
had utterly weighed him down, or else the
country had been deceived by his wise
aspect and his spectacles from the very
beginning. Patterson, from whom the
democracy never expected anything, had
developed a certain utterly brutal stupidity
which made him objectionable to all parties.
The nation had long since ceased to take
0 Loohlen seriously, and only tolerated him
as a harmless and gentlemanly object of
derision. And the daily papers, because
they were so long accustomed to the worn-
out, toothless, political hacks who had buzzed
aimlessly round the Treasury benches for
many years, had at last got into the habit of
thinking that fat and dull respectability
and extreme old age were the only
possible signs of political wisdom ; there-
fore, they habitually alluded to the Shiels
Cabinet as a species of joke, by reason of its
youthfulness and inexperience; and because,
in the course of its few weeks’ reign, it had
never met with any chance of displaying its
capacity, they took it for granted that it had
no capacity to display. The idea that a man
who had not pottered drearily about the
House for twenty years, and grown old and
muddled in the refreshment-room, could be
a capable head of the State, apparently
never occurred to anybody. Shiels had
risen suddenly and by chance, and the
country being unaccustomed to anything
but plodding mediocrity, it was cheerfully
assumed that such a chance never came to
anyone but a fool. Berry, apparently,
assumed this, and the ancient renegade from
the people’s cause, with his shoddy title and
his obtrusive “ loyalty,” came back with an
undisguised conviction that he was the man
of the hour, and that the country would
elect him as a shrieking reactionary merely
because it had elected him before as an
uncompromising democrat, and been sold.
And so profound was the public faith in
septuagenarian toothlessness and rheumatism
as the concomitants of statesmanship that
it was half believed in many quarters that
the Shiels Cabinet would collapse at the
sight of Berry, without a struggle ; and the
Premier’s contemptuous remark that the
country was not necessarily dependent on
aged persons with artificial molars, came
upon a large number of his hearers as a
surprise and an awakening.
* # #
Practically—though not ostensibly—the
contest lies between Shiels and Berry, and
that the propertied classes will give their
solid support to the latter is almost a
matter of certainty. Whether the Victorian
democratic party will give an equally solid
support to the Premier is at present a
matter of doubt, but if there is any sense or
foresight or political capacity among the
masses they will do so. Shiels is not an
ideal democrat, but he is the nearest approach
to one that can be obtained, and the Labour
Party, the Republicans, Land Nationalism's,
and other progressive elements of the com-
munity must either vote as one man for the
best democrat who is to be had, or else, by
their dissensions, allow the power to drift
into the hands of the “National” Association
and its prophets. And it must be remem-
bered in his favour that Premier Shiels has
done more in his brief career for the demo-
cratic cause than 90 per cent, of the profes-
sional democrats of Australia. The Divorce
Bill, which stands to his credit in the Vic-
torian statute-book, is in itself a greater
benefit to the public than all that was accom-
plished by Graham Berry in all his long
and stormy existence as a Tribune of
the People. The Victorians have still a
vague and hazy reverence for the latter
individual because he promised to “ burst up
the big estates,” which estates remain un-
burst to this day - because he. or one of his
Ministers, threatened to ship the Governor
back to his native land, and did not ship
him—because he announced a programme of
broken heads and flaming houses, and yet no
heads were broken, and no houses flamed in
any part of the province. And it has a
vague and hazy contempt for Shiels because
he never stumped the country in a frenzy
with his hair standing on end and a
trail of broken promises and extinguished
fireworks in his wake. But it is for
the nation to remember that even when
Berry was a democrat upon the stump
he did practically nothing for anybody save
himself, and now that he is a lurid Tory and
too old to go upon the stump any longer
there is absolutely nothing to be hoped for
from him or any party with which he is
associated. The choice lies between the man
who promised much and did nothing, and the
man who, so far, has promised little and kept
his pledges to the uttermost.
# # »
The programme of the Shield Govern-
ment, though far from complete in many
respects, is much the best that has yet
appeared in Victoria. It includes the
abolition of the bogus banks which prey
upon the working classes ; an income-
tax, and a tax on the unimproved
value of land—both of which tend to shift
the State burdens from the poor on to the
rich, while the latter in particular is a step
in the right direction of socialism, and ought
to command the generous support of the
democracy. Also, he propounds a distinct
scheme for the breaking up of the great land
monopoly by the repurchase of estates —to
be paid for by Government inscribed stock—
and their sale (for which leasing should be
substituted) to agriculturists in small allot-
ments on easy terms of payment ; and he
announces himself definitely as a supporter
of the One-man-one-vote policy. More-
over, he is one of the very few Aus-
tralian politicians who pledge themselves
to support this principle as the basis
of the Australian Federation. Against
this there appears the rival policy of
Berry, and of Gillies, that fuzzy old man
whose place Berry will presently Jump,
which consists chiefly in a bald and vague,
not to say melancholy, statement, to the
effect that they believe in making a “ great
effort ”to restore the national credit. The
scheme of the Shiels Government may be
comparatively meagre, but, at all events, it
includes not one proposal of a retrogressive
character. So far as it goes, it is purely
democratic, and the very fact that it contains
no widely reckless promises, is, in itself, a
proof that the Premier has carefully ab-
stained from any attempt to purchase votes
with impossible assurances. And, on the
other side, there is absolutely nothing save
bland and gentle drivel, and old, disused
platitudes of the mildest type.
* # *
There is even yet a possibility that Graham
Berry will attempt to storm the country
with an imposing programme, such as he was
wont to get up in the days of old. If he
does, it can only be hoped that the Victorian
democracy will remember how it trusted to
his garish programmes in the past, and will
refuse to be again defrauded. Whether
Berry ever was anything but a blatant Toiy
at heart, no one can tell; the one absolute
certainty is that he will never be anything
but a Tory in the future. Six long years of
grovel in British conservative circles have
utterly destroyed any popular sympathies he
ever possessed; the K. C.M.G. cannot be born
again in his old age, neither can the ancient
bigot change his spots. The one present
hope of the progressive party in Victoria lies
in the Shiels Government; it may possibly
prove a failure, but the venerable political
hacks who form the only immediate alterna-
tive have all proved themselves failures
already and are foredoomed, every one. The
fact that the present Premier is practically
the creation of an accident does not count in
his disfavour ; the old placemen whom these
provinces have deliberately selected of late
years— Service, Berry, Griffith, M‘ll-
wraith, Parkes, Playford, Vogel, and
others—have done so little good and so much
harm that a politician who came to the
surface in a period of temporary confusion
cannot possibly be worse than the average.
The much advertised circumstance that the
Victorian Ministry consists entirely of new
men, is in itself a reason why it should
receive the ungrudging support of the
democracy ; the old men of Victorian politics
are incurably wedded to the old grooves, and
only a fool hopes to keep a fossil moving in
the paths of progress. Moreover, Premier
Shiels, though not an ideal democi’at, is far
in advance of Victorian democrats in general.
Too much Coalition has reduced the province
to a stolid Conservative state of mind from
which it is only beginning to recover. It
suffers from a surfeit of Union Jackism and
“God Save the Queen/' and has a grovel-
ling tendency to collect subscriptions for
presents to royalty. When it awakes from
this condition it may offer a field for a states-
man of more advanced ideas, but at present
Shiels, who, with a fair trial at the hands
of the people, may expand as he goes along,
is as pronounced a democrat as the country
can well hold.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Kanaka “ Scandals.”
The following parsonical item from Queensland
exhibits the humble expounder in his usual
aspect as a man who always desires to give a
lift to the ricli members of his congregation
At a meeting of the Brisbane Ministers’ Union to-day a
resolution was passed partly affirming the desirableness
of re-introducing black labour, and expn ssing a wish that
all scandals in connection with black labour in Queensland
be done away with.
In other words, the Ministers’ Union wants to
have the leper whitewashed for the future, and
to varnish the loathsome thing so that it will
look outwardly respectable. The real scandal
lies in the fact that the Kanaka doesn’t want
to come, and has to be brought along either by
fraud or violence ; that he doesn’t want to stay
when he has come, and can only be forced to
remain by fine or imprisonment ; that he can’t be
made to sign his three years’ agreement except
by lying and misrepresentation or brutal ter-
rorism ; and that he .dies off at a rate which
makes his employment in the sugar-industry
deliberate murder pure and simple. The Union
is apparently agreeable to all these tlihios
because it can’t have black labour without
them, ami it has got to boom black labour else
the capitalist will quit the church and stop his
subscription. But it wants the “scandals”
connected with the traffic “ done away with ”
which is equivalent to saying that it wants no
row made about them in the papers. Hitherto
whenever a labour ship came back, the captain
and crew have almost invariably gone on
fearsome drunk, and smashed things in
public-houses, and told in hiccoughs grue-
some talcs about their doings among the islands
and the papers have got hold of these facts and
made unpleasant disclosures. Also intrusive
people have gone about at times among the
natives, and interrogated them in their 5 own
language, and collected disagreeable informa-
tion ; and now and then some coroner or ocher
meddlesome public official has inquired about
deaths on the plantations which seemed a little
more ugly and suspicious even than usual. If
the captains and crews can be kept strictly tee-
total and prevented from smashing things and
telling tales, and no one save the planter and
his friends get access to the native employes,
and the coroner has strict instructions to lie
low, and the Registrar-General will keep quiet
and cook the death-records, then there will be
no more Kanaka “scandals.” There never is
any scandal except when somebody digs under the
hearthstone and things are found out. So long
as the kidnapped Polynesian is alluded to only
as a “ benighted brother who has been happily
brought within the pale of Christianity,” and
the nigger who has been killed off on a'planta-
tion is spoken of as a humble friend who has
been removed by Providence from this vale of
tears, and nobody is allowed to use coarse ex-
pressions about cither of them, all will be well.
It is a process of putting roses on the gallows
and painting the lily and the hangman, and
throwing eau-de-cologne over the dead Kanaka,
and making things comfortable for all parties!
Now that the Church is on the job, the deceased
islander will probably get a better tombstone
than he used to do, and an aloe will be planted
over his grave, and an air of piety and collection-
plate will be shed over the scene—but the island
traffic will bo the same old infamy as before,
for it is absolutely incurable. The leper may
be whitewashed, but he remains a leper all the
same.

N S.W. Primrose League.
The New South Wales National Association
wisely selected the sequestered hamlet of Manly,
where the people are “poor and proud,” for
debuting in all the gdazed glory of its political
dickejn In this discretionary valour, it care-
fully imitated its brother-dude of Victoria,
whose eyeglass has always been prominent in
nests of political pimpdom far removed from
the haunts of brawny humanity. As it costs
each visitor a minimum of one shilling to visit
“ Our Village,” the initial meeting of the New
South Wales National Ass. was insured against
disturbance at the hands of the manhood-
suffragists; therefore, the National Ass. rolled
up with confident enthusiasm and invited its
feminine friends to attend its formal christening
and admire its cheap perfumery. There were
quite 60 people present at the meeting, and
more than half of them were ladies. The new r
power is thus seen to be putting forth a giant
strength. It is evidently destined to be the
Primrose League of Australia, so far as any
such Tory institution can flourish in a demo-
cratic community. Its chief function will be to
amuse the less serious hours of an overworked
people, and act as a Punch-and-Judy “com-
bine.” The oratorical heralds of the new move-
ment—if they may be taken seriously—gave
very hazy inklings of their intended programme.
The one-man-one-vote was certainly mentioned
incidentally in a feebly condemnatory fashion,
but even this vague reference drew an interjec-
tion of dissent from one of the score-and-odd
males present. But there w T as a cautious
absence of declaration that the secret fixed-idea
of the National Ass. is to prevent the adoption
of manhood suffrage, and that its one defined
ambition is to confer upon the man who owns
bricks-and-mortar just twice as many votes as the
man who possesses no bricks-and-mortar. Even
wdth its flaccid programme, the meeting w'as a
neat compliment to one of the most venal elector-
ates of New'South Wales—a constituency whose
whole political creed may be summed up in the
desire to get railways and bridges and other
etceteras to improve the values of its private
properties at the expense of the State. Sir
Henry Paukes has recognised this special attri-
bute of Manly on occasions, when he has chosen
it as a safe theatre from which to make public
announcements in the way of experimenting
how the public cat would be likely to jump.
The Manly meeting of the National Ass. was
congenially engineered. The chair was occu-
pied by the local Mayor, a nice-looking poten-
tate, who acts as engineer to the Colonial Sugar
Co. Mr. W. T. Poole, a distinguished “ law-and-
order ” man, moved the first flabby resolution
generalising the “public-confidence’’and “good-
feeling ” cant of the day. Mr, „ Cope, the
seconder of that resolution, is a squatter, an
attorney, an ex-Soudan volunteer, and amateur
officer of strike-time mounted police. Mr.
Adrian Knox, who supported the resolution,
belongs to the same set; Mr. Littlejohn,
another speaker, is a merchant; Mr. A. ConsetT
Stephen, who dittoed his predecessors, is an
attorney ; Mr. W. M. Arnold, another platform
meteor, has succeeded, at the age of 36 years,
in becoming a pensioner on the State ; and the
local secretary of the movement is a bank-clerk
—altogether, a happy Primrose family. We
want to see the “ National ” Ass. hold an open
(not a packed) meeting in Sydney Centennial
Hall.
The Moonta miners, enraged at the failure
of their recent strike, have “ kicked” their Union.
Bad to worse.
Counsel who appeared for a Chow, charged
with perjury at Melbourne Criminal Court, argued
that the prisoner’s limited knowledge of English
made him very liable to say exactly the opposite
of what he really meant. “0, yes, welly good—
ollys mean zackly difHent,” chipped in the China-
man, who had just pleaded “Not guilty,” by the
way.

The Horse-Leech and His Office-Boy.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Tucbe Manning (N.S.W.), tho other day,
*H°an application made on behalf of an
rrff. , Hauidator,” who had sent out circulars
‘'oli| cl " l(;^ca ji>> U pon 25 shareholders, and who
iiiivk'no ree guineas costs on eacli circular, or
'blip's in all. The Judge most nnprofessionally
a ’t'public that each letter would only cost
i a official liquidator” about Ud.—a penny for
and a halfpenny for stationery—and that
aSta tlrer cost of the whole 25 “ would not, at the
be more than one shilling.”
°v / had the application been made on behalf
f lawyer, as solicitor in a ca-e, it would pro-
° llvnot only have passed Judge Manning, but
babiy censor ious quill of the Court’s taxing-
e^' n Only in the light that it was a brotherly
. C ting of lay intrusion, a snub prompted by
f Se \ espritde corps, can Ids Honor’s conduct be at
n justified, from a professional point of view.
il ‘ ll j yen in that case he might have refused the
lication on behalf of the “official liquidator”
giving reasons for that refusal, and cer-
tainly without exposing the “ trade” cost of legal
luxuries. # * «
4 lawyer’s bill-of-costs is an artistic branch
feme of the inexact sciences. It is wondrous in
its mazy beauty. Firstly, it is generally for a
'‘lump sum.” But a pitying law permits a client
to demand detailed items. Only, the client so
demanding must pay Bd. a sheet (foolscap) for sa’d
trailing list of details. Whereby his costs are
visibly increased. Next, in case of items being
disputed, the matter goes before the prothonotary
for “taxation.”
If the amount of a bill-of-costs be reduced by tho
taxing-officer by one-sixth of itself, the solicitor
presenting such a bill must pay the costs of the
anneal to the taxing-officer. If the total amount
be not reduced by at least one-sixth, then the
ambling client, in addition to his taxed costs,
has to pay the cost of having had those costs
I 'aSolicitor very seldom indeed has to pay the
costs of any appeal to the taxing-officer. Just
read this i
Lawyer Snipe makes up a bill-of-costs which
comes to (say) £9OO. Nine-tenths of tire items are
downright exactionary (though legal, lawful)
swindles. But as Mr. Taxing-Officer must some-
times do something to justify the payment of his
big salary, Snipe adds (say) .£lOO to the bill in
the form of items which he scarcely expects to
pass the taxing process, yet which, on the other
hand, may possibly squeeze through. Mr. Taxing-
Officer runs down the items, now amounting to a
total of £lOOO, and, feeling unusually merciful
that day, scores out and reduces items to the
amount of (say) £IGO. Now, .as £l6O is not quite
one-sixth of £lOOO, being just £6l3s. 4d. less than
that fractional part, the client has to pay the
costs of taxation. The more audacious and
numerous the absolutely illegal items in a lawyer’s
bill-of-costs are, the more probably will the re-
ductions by the taxing-officer fail to reach the
costs saving proportion, and the more sui'ely will
the client have to pay the costs of his “ con-
tumacy.”
Thus the Law majestically says: “You have
accused an officer of this honourable court of trying
to swindle you, and the taxing-officer has certainly
found him guilty of trying to swindle you. It is
a pretty audacious attempt at a pretty bad
swindle, but not so bad as it might have been,
and it is within the margin of attempted swindle
that is allowed to a privileged guild of professional
swindlers. Therefore, you, Mr. Gull, must pay
the costs of these proceedings.”
In nine cases out of ten, Mr. Gull goes away
from the court beamingly satisfied, because he
hears that £l6O has been knocked off the bill-of-
costs, and he fancies that he has smitten the
solicitor badly. The solicitor simply smiles
behind his ineffable cheek.
No client has ever yet been mad enough to
suggest to the court that a solicitor, the taxation
of whose costs has virtually branded him as a
swindler, should be sent to gaol for false pretences.

People in general think that the tidal
waves which swell a lawyer’s bill are chiefly the
big fees paid to barristers. Nothing of the kind.
Barristers are fretting evils in their own peculiar
"’ays, but they are mere annoyances compared
with the one big, central, root-grievance.
That is the Office-Boy,
The solicitor’s Office-Boy !
Every time a solicitor’s Office-Boy runs a
message—to carry a note, or post a letter, or look
at the time, or ask when the train starts for
nowhere—somebody is charged 3s. 4d., or 6s. Bd.,
wl3r. 4d., according to the grade of costs in the
particular case.
An Office-Boy, when kept fairly going in this
"my, is as remunerative a property as a big
plumbing business. He is paid from 7s. 6d. to
, : l )er week. As an Office-Boy in the abstract,
le A s generally dear at the price; regarded as a
Ti'n **’ * le * s a bonanza investment,
the Office-Boy reaches his sublimest altitude as
wealth-producer (for his master) when he has
earned to “copy” briefs for barristers. Now,
m current market-price for “ copying-out ” briefs
* 2d. per folio ” of 72 words. You can get it
ype-wntten at that rate, if yon prefer type to
n igraphy, with a reduction if you take more
an ” ne copy. For instance, a solicitor may
.- uee or four copies of a brief typewritten.

represent IGs. Bd., a clear profit of 14s. 4d. But
it doesn’t atop there.
There is an additional charge of Gs. Bd. per

reward to the solicitor for his imaginary pro-
fessional work in connection with the brief. So
far as the alleged libellous matter is concerned,
that professional work is that ho, or a cheap
minion of his, points out to the “ copyist,” per-
haps his office-boy or articled-clerk, or to the
type-writer, what part of The Bulletin leader he
is to “copy” out. Thus, the mere “copying”
out of that Bulletin column of 1008 words brings
in another five sums of Gs. Bd., or .£1 13s. 4d.
Total received so far for “copying” the column,
£2 10s.
Next, in this connection, there would appear

Total realised out of The Bulletin column

office-boy is used, when it would be nil) plus Gd.,
2s. lOd.; profit on this part of the brief only,
<£2 11s.
* # #
Now, scan the brief as a whole.
A brief consists of—(1) the pleadings; (2) the
correspondence, and (in the supposititious instance)
the quoted libel; (3) counsel’s advice. Add to
these the possibility that the solicitor himself may
“ draw ” some statement of the case; sometimes he
does ; sometimes he does not. When he does not,
he simply does nothing at all beyond handing
over the things to be “copied ” to the “tupponce-
a-folio ” man, or to the sweated less-than-a-penny-
a-folio wretch, or to the wages Office-Boy, or to
the premium-paying articled clerk. For, look
you! the barrister “draws” the pleadings; the
correspondence and the newspaper quotations arc
there ready-made; and “counsel’s advice ”is self-
indicative of its origin. The solicitor does
nothing but make out the bill-of costs and pocket
the fees.
Now, a libel-brief such as I have supposed in a
suit against The Bulletin might run to 100
sheets, and there might be three barristers em-
ployed in the cause. In which case, three copies
of the brief would be required, and the entries
alluding to the “ copying’’—and those entries
only, remember, among hundreds of others of
equally ingenious kinds—would appear thus in
the completed bill-of-costs :
The smaller fees for “attending Mr. Limpet”
are reckless generosity on the part of the
solicitor who sends his office-boy, or clerk, with
the brief. It is a sentimental redaction, due only
to the fact that the sum marked on Limpet’s brief
is smaller than those that ornament the briefs of
Shark and Horseleech. It is fantastically
imagined that it is cheaper to climb up five flights
of stairs and wait upon Limpet himself in his sky-
lighted lair than it is to hand the brief to the
office-boys of Shark and Horseleech on the ground
floor. This is perhaps, the only matter in which
a solicitor is humorous at his own expense.
The approximate cost of “copying” 100 sheets
three times over, or 300 sheets, taking it at 6d.
per sheet, would be £7 10s. That, too, would be
at top rates for “copying ” singly each brief three
times over; type-writing by multifold process
would not cost more than .£5. The unhappy
client is, however, charged <£B6 13s. 4d. —a profit
in the one case of <£79 3s. 4d., and in the other of
<£Bl 13s. 4d.
This balance is practically for wear and tear of
the office-boy.
Isn’t the office-boy, rightly used, a solicitor’s
Golconda ?
# # *
Blue foolscap is another mine of wealth to
the solicitor, and greedily drinks the blood of the
man who hires a lawyer.
At every law-stationer’s establishment are to be
purchased one or two hundreds of legal printed
forms, warranted to suit all the diseases of liti-
gants. Each of these various forms takes up half-
a:sheeb of blue foolscap. They are sold at from
Is. to Is. 3d. per dozen—ld. to l|d. apiece. That
price is unblushingly extortionate, but the solicitor
pays it cheerfully, and passes the required docu-
ments on to his client at a charge of several
shillings each—so much for “drawing,” and so
much for “copying.” It is true that the solicitor
does not “draw” anything, while his office-boy,
or articled clerk—or, perhaps, a “ copying” clerk
at 30s. a week ; or, maybe, a sweatee at Id. a folio
—does the “copying.” But it is the legal thing
to charge liberally both for “ drawing ” and
“copying.” Ask the taxing-officer if you don’t
believe me.
Now, every one of these forms that are in legal
use was originally “drawn” by some old cloistered
monk or other in the days of (perhaps) William
the Conqueror, or his son, William, the Jersey-
coloured, and if a solicitor of to-day had the
temerity to alter a single word of their formulae,
exhibited the hardihood of venturing upon any
originality to specially suit the case he had in
hand, the court before whom his audacious
attempt at literature was presented would pro-
bably swoon with surprise, or go off in an in-
dignant fit of apoplexy, or epileptically foam all
over the Judge’s associate.
Yet the client is solemnly and legally rooked
of much substance on the pretence that his lawyer
has been shedding his brain in order to frame a
cunning legal instrument that should exactly fit
into the mazy intricacies of his particular predica-
ment. Whereas, if any solicitor at any time did
draw upon his brain-account for anything original
in the interest of his clients, the items relating to
his brain-perspiration would be ruthlessly cut out
of the bill-of-costs by the taxing-officer.
A solicitor is allowed to charge for “ drawing ”
documents which he never did “draw,” and for
“copying” others which he never did “copy,”
and he is permitted to add about 1200 per cent, on
the cost of everything on which he pays anything.
All these items, the taxing-officer will pass un-
and as a matter of course; but
brain-usage is not scheduled as a fit and proper
item to appear in any bill-of-costs.
In short, our Courts provide no brain allowance,
but recognise a tariff of market rates for
mechanical work. It is a bogus shoddy, humour-
ously and falsely branded “ law,” and it is sold by
the yard—or, rather, by the mile.

I will hero insert my first moral, my first
note of desired reform
The taxing-officer should not be a lawyer, but
n initiated layman.
# # *
Outside of the taxing jurisdiction the law-
yer lias many fuxinesaes. He is almost invariably
a money-lender, and many loan and discount
agencies and money-lending Hebrew firms have
direct interests in common with many lawyers
concerning whose means of livelihood the public
are often bewildered, on account of their legal
practices being mostly invisible. Money-lending,
however, is such an esoteric branch of the honour-
able profession of the law that I should have to
hire myself out for a term with some Mozzler firm
of “poor people’s friends” before I could authori-
tatively enlarge upon it.
Lawyers shine as debt-collectors. Their common
habit of endeavouring to extort a letter-writing fee
of one guinea, over and above the debt for which
they dun you, is a barefaced, vulgar fraud, which
has been frequently exposed in the columns of
The Bulletin.
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
Seeing Williams.
Melbourne City Police Court is a nice place when
you know it, but you’d got to know it first any
time during business hours on Tuesday, Wednes-
day, and Thursday of last week. Let us suppose
that our entrance to the sanctum was always an
easy matter, unembittered by struggles with an
excited populace on the steps and unimpeded by
vigilant chuckers-out at a succession of narrow
doorways. Enough that we got there, whilst
greater persons, boasting more social distinction,
political influence and stomach, were compelled to
stop outside and snort. Magistrates, solicitors,
Ms.L. A., and all sorts of pillars of the State
pleaded for admission and “ took the numbers”of
the inflexible constabulary without making the
least difference. Even a sublime flunkey from the
Legislative Council couldn’t reach the court
until he had frothed at the mouth and called
Heaven to witness that sundry policemen didn’t
address him as “sir.” Nobody called vs “sir,”
but we swallowed our indignation and said
nothing.
* * »
The interior of this court, also of most other
courts, suggests a private chapel where people
don’t go to pray, or a small theatre in which
encores are prohibited. On the present occasion
it is like a chapel licensed for a theatrical per-
formance, but devoid of an orchestra. Let us
make for the ground floor, or stalls, entrance to
the sacred shovvplace, and obtain admission at the
door on the right. This is the nearest way of
getting close to the Immortal Williams. Wil-
liams is not held up to admiration as he might be.
He occupies a chair in the right-hand aisle of the
court, at the end of the solicitors’ table, and he
sits lower than the rest of the congregation. This
is a sad mistake. Directly the show opens George
Rignold (supporting his old friend Dr. Neild on
the bench) wonders what in the name of blank the
stage-manager is about. Why not place the “star”
miscreant upon a scaffolding and turn on the lime-
light? The same thought occurs to J. C. Williamson
and Teddy Royce when they look in next morning,
and Billy Elton, away up in the gallery, considers
that a low comedian of Williams’ versatility is
wasted by not being put on the table beside the
canary-cage. On the first day, however, Williams
is frequently ordered to stand up and be sworn to,
a ceremony which pleases the little man for awhile,
because he is glad of an opportunity to stretch his
legs and smile at the j ury on the cross bench near
the dooi’, on the opposite side of the court. But
the novelty of bobbing up soon wears off, and he
gets sick of being disturbed. He can lean back
in his chair and paralyse the fair sex in the left-
hand gallery with an occasional glance of his
hard, magnetic, reddish - grey eye. A cold,
hot, amorous unsympathetic eye, that gleams
from under a bunch of light-carrotty eyebrows
protruding from a well-marked bump of percep-
tion. The maids and matrons in the right-hand
gallery can’t feel the influence of this icy, burning
optic, but they enjoy a fine view of the gentle-
man’s head, which, despite a nasty slope back
from the brows, would be a possible casket for
many virtues. Some of the jury carry heads less
prepossessing. Venus and Adonis! how the
women do gloat on this puny, round-shouldered
plumber, with the abnormal chin. He is notorious,
and notoriety is more dazzling than diamonds.
Williams, an expert in female human nature of
the middle and lower grades, knows that the
tallowy widow in the front row would take
him to her flabby bosom (if nobody were
looking) as eagerly as those three spinstei-s who
hang over the balcony a few feet nearer to the
coroner. His high spirits are excusable. No
wonder that he looks with rollicking derision at
Marshall Lyle, his solicitor. Lyle is a compara-
tively lovely creature, with curly hair trained
down to a point in the centre of his milk-white
forehead, and a long, brown, Scriptural kind of
beard fringing his fair young face, yet no heart in
court palpitates for him .
• • *
It is not to be supposed that every woman
coming to see Williams is necessarily the slave of
his celebrity. Gracie Whiteford, who secures a
good dress-circle seat next to Widow O’Brien
Sheridan, takes a purely professional view of the
case. Williams stands about sft. 3iin., has a
shapely, aquiline nose, a mobile face, and a magni-
ficent sense of humour. “He’d make up very
well for the Widow,” remarks Gracie, and the
x’eal Mrs. O’Brien endorses this opinion. But it
would take them all their time to make up a
suitable expression for Williams’ mouth, which
has a nasty trick of opening like an iron rat-trap
and closing with a jerk.
* * *
Perhaps, too, those lady “ journalists ” who
invade the floor of the Court on the first day, and
flap their huge note-books with ostentatious pride,
are guiltless of any devouring passion for
Williams. One hopes so, because Williams is so
recklessly indifferent to their charms. When
at last the rustling mob begin to close
round his chair, and stare up his nostrils
and down his hairy ears, the little hero
gnashes his rat-trap at them, as many a
better man would under like provocation. Solo-
mons, the dealer, has a real grievance against
these appalling daughters of tea-party literature,
since it was they who infuriated the hearthstone
man and caused him to land poor Solly one in the
eye as he was being bustled out of court to his
luncheon in the corridor adjoining the cells hard
by. It was here that Williams liked to have a
snack, all calm and peaceful-like amongst the
constables. He used quite bad language to a
young artist assisting George Ashton in work for
a London paper, who attempted a sketch of the
hyena at feeding-time. Later on he aimed a
potato through a small glass window at the same
artist, but probably this was hurled in play.
Williams is as full of play as a barrel-organ
grinder.
« # #
The animosity which Williams cherishes for
Mr. Solomons is not explained by their previous
relations. The Hebrew dealer has done no harm
to the other man, although lie might have gone a
trifle higher than three “quid ” for the histoin
canary. Witnesses walk into the box, one after
another, and identify “the man we call Williams
at the end of the table,” with events much more
damning than the incidental sale of the caged bird
that sings so sweetly on the table there in front of
Prosecutor Walsh, Q.C. Walsh doesn’t sing
sweetly—but we digress. Williams seems to bear
no particular grudge against these other people.
His disliking for Solomons is as the unaccountable
antipathy of a dog to a particular visitor at his
master’s house —the passion of a brute beast. It
is not to be reconciled with the man’s evident
liking for Max Hirschfeldt, who went over to
Western Australia with the detectives to identify
his late shipmate. Max treats Williams as a
capital joke, and Williams leers quite tenderly at
the trim German gentleman as he repeats in the
witness-box his expression of ojnnion that prisoner
“will hang as sure as God made little apples.”
They are bound together by a merry bond of
humour. N.B— Did God make little Williams ?
* • •
Williams grows shockingly funny as the case
goes on, and the sergeants and constables in
attendance, smart, bright fellows one and all, as
it happens, are constantly ; railing at the mad
wag. They will miss him when he’s hanged, no
doubt. All evidence that bears upon the cement
and hearthstone episode strikes Williams as be’ng
extra droll. His profile at these times gives one
the impression that he is about to oblige the com-
pany with a comic song. Some of Coroner Neild’s
comrades on the bench permit the dim twilight of
a grin to steal across their faces now and again,
although for the most part (these distinguished
patrons of the drama come and go frequently)
they are dull, pompous individuals. Harrie
Smith, a racing-club secretary closely related to
some other Smith of legal standing, expands
his cheeks under the mahogany canopy for
a time on the second day. Panton, P.M.,
comes in through the magistrates’ door
at the back and gazes serenely on his
court. Sylvester Biowne, the silver king, hand-
some son of Auak and brother to “ Rolf Boldre-
wood,” stands within the enclosure, to the coroner’s
left, and tries his hand at sketching Williams. He
is unobserved of the subject, for Williams at tlvs
time is trying to mash a Sydney lady, the only
“ bit of muslin ” downstairs, who occupies a seat
beside old Townsend Macdermott, the barrister,
under the shadow of the Bench. Macdermott,
having himself failed to catch the eye of beauty,
shifts Ins seat, and betrays his jealousy by scowl-
ing at Williams worse than ever. Next day, when
Williams falls asleep in court, and loses himself in
the land of happy dreams, the unfeeling Mac.
swears that his successful rival is a wide-awake
impostor. “ Why didn’t he fall asleep yesterday?”
growls Macdermott, doubtless thinking of the
angel with maize ribbons on her hat.
# # *
Kate Rounsevcll comes on towards the end of
the second act. She had flitted across the stage,
so to speak, in the first act for the purpose of
being recognised by an ancient mariner, but that
was nothing. All the rest of the time up to now
Kate has been at the wings—meaning the ante-
room or vestry behind the witness-box—waiting
for her cue to come forward and knock ’em. The
Hirschfeldts are in charge of the leading lady, and
Williams (since he learned this fact) has vainly
endeavoured to breathe his vows anew through
the medium of genial Max. Enter Miss Rounse-
vell. Young reporters, scribbling away in the
centre pews, or reserved stalls, are disposed to
over-estimate the charms of Miss Kate, who is in
truth a very passable vision in a saucy hat and a
dark-blue cream-fronted dress, cut to give her
slight figure a good chance. Emotion is not the
damsel’s forte, and she never gets xvithin
measurable distance of a flood of tears,
or anything of that sort. Her collected man-
ner in the witness-box is in harmony with the
story she tells of a strange “gentleman,” diamond
rings, a lightning courtship, an intended marriage,
and a shattered dream —all within a month. Miss
Kate seems to bear her loss with Christian resigna-
tion. Girls, as a rule, are proud of the man they
mean to marry. One would be interested to learn
whether this placid young spinster, after a hasty
glance at “ Baron Swanston ” in his present state,
recognises the influence of diamonds and mu u;•
tachios in the most important events of this life.
* * *
It is hard to understand that Williams was ever
a gaudy, boastful man. One can imagine him
with a swag, but not with a swagger. Since his
arrest he has at once aged in appearance and yet
gone back in his style, until he has indeed become
the type of an elderly, jocular, lustful plumber
with a natural turn for ferocity. We are all so
wise, you see, after the event; we see so many
virtues in the well-dressed, successful man; so
many villainies in the fellow behind the spikes.
« * *
Williams undoubtedly frets—hungrily, savagely,
humorously over the loss of Miss Rounsevell.
His dark, auburn-brown hair would glitter With
electric sparks if she came into his cell and smiled
upon him. Dr. Neild and his medical brethren
who line the Bench on the last day agree in think-
ing that Williams would choke Kate if she ven-
tured within arm’s-reach of her baffled Lothario.
No. He might bite a piece off Kate, but not for the
joy of injuring her. Merely for the pleasure of
chewing the delicate morsel, and carrying the
flavour of it to his grave. The mad sensualist
takes precedence of the brutal murderer in Mr.
Williams-Deeming. Probably he has always been
a kind, pleasant, well-meaning man during the
first two or three days of his honeymoons. With
the original Mrs. D. he was not a bad sort of
fellow for several years. She suited him much
better than pious Emily Mather suited him.
Besides, his disease was in its infancy when he
lived in Sydney.
* * «
Giddy barmaids in gay apparel decorated the
opposite gallery on the third day and ogled
Williams to his heart’s content whilst the jury
were drawing up an elaborate verdict. His nap
had refreshed him, and his demeanour was
riotously amorous. The show was drawing to a
close, he would be shut off from any view of
millinery very soon, so he must feast his eyes on
lovely woman ere the curtain fell. He went out
in high glee, inflamed by the melodious “Oh-o-o!”
of the ladies when he advised Coroner Neild to
“put the verdict in his pipe and smoke it.” There
was a damsel near the gangway as Williams was
being rushed away to the cells. Rapture!
Williams made a sudden dash, managed to chuck
her under the chin, and murmured, “You
duckey !” Truly a characteristic exit.
“ There was no furniture in the house
except an old whitewash-brush and a piece of
cardboard,” said Sergeant o‘Longhlen at the
Deeming inquest. Which reminds us very much
of the man who had no clothes on except an oil-
painting and a stove. 1

SIC Macquarie-street North, Sydney, r April 13, 1892.
My Dear Aloorarinda, —
People who like to draw distinctions betxveen the sexes
flattering to the male-half of humanity ought (making all
due alloxvance for the difference between the manners of
the haul ton and the bourgeoisie) to find substance for
much moralising in the contrast of Capt. Osborne’s
behaviour to his guilt}’ xvife over the Hargreaves pearl-
stealing case and the way in which Aliis Rounsevell
rounded on her ex-adorer Deeming and gax e him away,
lock, stock and barrel, at the first hint of anything un-
pleasant. Capt. Osborne—as everybody knows—stood
beside the dock containing his wretched wife during the
whole trial; Aliss Rounsevell seemingly agreed with the
first person who pronounced against her lover—and as for
lending him personal support! well, if she had, mind you,
people would have sneered olex erly at the strange blind-
ness of every woman to a possible husband’s villainies—
but all the same, if she had stuck to him and, publicly at
least, refused to believe guilty until ho was proved guilty
the man whom she had set out to marry, she would have
cut a much better figure in the dreadful affair. And
what a valuable wide-world advertisement there was in it!
She could have posed for weeks in print as the embodi-
ment of faithfulness, trust, true, unquestioning love and
ail the rest of the dog-like virtues which man hankers
after in a wife ; and to be practical, xvho knows what
wealthy offers of marriage she might have secured by-
reason of said virtues after they bad been judiciously
advertised in a thousand ncxvspapers? Instead she refused
even to grant him an interview' (I hear she feared he
might injure her in self-defence), and wound up by testify-
ing against him at the inquest with a bunch of flowers in
lier jacket!
No matter how criminal the man may seem, a woman
who, in his palmy days, professed enough love for him to
set out for a distant part of Australia to be ids xvife, ought
not to come gaily adorned into court among his accusers.
However much “ her love had turned to loathing” com-
mon decency gave her a part to act and she should have
acted it. But the lady’s sudden enmity to her alleged
1n er is, after all, surely only a public expression of the
sentiment that would forever have remained underneath,
had 'Deeming been the rich man he swaggered to be.
Wonvn hate the very name of the Decming-Ronnsvell
affair because it is such a complete revelation of the
heights and depths of the mercenary or cupboard-love
side of their character. Not, please note, that I think my
poor, dear sex are to blame, in any way for connubializing
with a banking-account—it is entirely the fault of
their training, and so I r.o more think of condemning a
woman for breaking her neck after a man who can write
big cheques than 1 xvould whip a monkey for dancing on
a barrel-organ. And even if a woman is brought up to
judge for herself, social conditions soon make it cruelly
plain that money is the lover for her. Every level-headed
woman sets a reserve price on herself, as it were—the
foolish virgins do the other thing, with the result that,
in a fexv years, the foolish ex-virgin’s pa finds himself
supporting bis daughter, her husband, and a swarm of
infants with power to add to their number. If there is no
solid relative to sponge on, the valiant girl xvho heroically
casts in her lot with one pound per week, is pawning her
boots before sbe knows where she is, and helping to get an
Act of Parliament passed to have a new orphan asylum
erected—so you can hardly' blame the girl who is bowled
out in a dollar-chase, can you? In the long run, the
mercenary woman, even if she never limes her bird, is far
less expense and worry to the community than the trust-
ing idiot who'gives-her whole soul into the fond keeping
of the first eligible suitor with a throbbing heart and
paper collar, who chances to like the colour of her hair.
The psychological similarity of one woman ti another,
no matter what colour she is or what language she clothes
her ideas in, xvas again exemplified—in Melbourne this
time—on the first day of Alister Deeming’s trial. Said a
German lady-witness Mr. and Airs. Williams travelled
with us on the Kaiser Wilhelm, and I xvas sure Airs.
Williams’ upper teeth were false !” The remark had to
lie interpreted from German to English, by the way, but
how familiar it must have sounded to every man in court!
“ Caste,” at the Criterion, is not frantically frocky, and
speaking by the fashion-plate, you don’t carry much
away xvilli you from “Caste ”in your eye. Airs. Brough
—but before I go on to say how nice she looked in both
(he plain xvhitc cashmere dinner-dress and the still plainer
weeds, I want, to cheer the lady for the realism of tier
acting all through, especially in the second act, xxhero
there is a lot of fainting to ba engineered, and it is so
easy for a longdimbed \v6man <to make swooning ridicul-
ous ontlie stage. But Airs. B. xveiit off so naturally that
you wondered why on earth Pattie Browne didn't begin
to burn the feathers in her pea-green bat. Airs. Brough
helps herself on to fame by tha delicate way she makes
up, and it is a pity soma of the Criterion people don’t
folloxv suit. Not that I want to point the finger cf scorn
at Air. Anson for that reason—his Eccles deserved a
special hand for the xvay he worked his face up into such
a red, swollen, indistinct, tipsy* visage. It will forever
remain a mystery to me how Air. A. can look so undesir-
able.
Do you know that what is really luring Mr. G. AY. Anson
to the land of roast-beef is that somebody has shuffled off
this mortal coil and left him-well, mere than enough
lor an in meinon'ain ring '<
It is Impossible to carp at the altogether lovely staging
accorded to “Master and Man” at Sydney Royal; the
only little rifts I discovered in the show were that Robert
Carlton’s housemaid officiated in a white gown and car-
dinal sleeves instead of in the sombre black that should
distinguish the female menial; and that Robert Carlton
himself ought to wear both gloves when the spirit moves
him to conceal his hands, instead of putting on only the
left and leaving the right dangling, after the fashion of
ten years ago. Otherwise the staging was more complete
than real life, for in every-day existence when you reach
out in a hurry after anything it isn’t there, hut Bland
Holt’s characters have everything right to their hands
without stretching even. Mrs. Bland Holt, as larky
be tty Lighlfoot, sported three Dresden Chinaish cos-
tumes—in the first act, a cream delaine designed in red
Cherries and looped over a cream petticoat, Dolly garden
hat with cherries all over it; Kate Bishop at the same
time looking particularly pretty in a heliotrope cashmere
with cascade of mulberry ribbons. In Act 2 Miss Bishop
wore sage-green, and Mrs. Bland Holt pale primrose
muslin with floral design in crimson, the front made A la
pinafore, a crimson sash passing underneath the drapery,
which fell straight from the throat—a gorgeous design,
by the way, for stout figures. A soft, blue-grey gown
with “cross-over” of pale pink silk with flounced edges
was Mrs Holt’s final thrill; but Miss Bishop (who by that
time had reached the very bed-rock of artistically-sug-
gested grief) had to content with a disconsolate tweed
garment blacker than her shadow.
Her Majesty’s Theatre Stock Co. bade Sydney adieu for
a lengthy period the other Friday, finishing up nobly
with “Nowadays.” Miss Watts-Phillips played Jenny
Dowling with her usual success, and I liked her best in
the heliotrope corduroy gown with vest of painted satin
and trimmings of silver lace, hat with wreath of myrtle,
which she sported in the last scene. There was a good
house to see the (professionally) last of the company, who
left for Adelaide on 9th inst. A great many friends
assembled to send them off, and Miss Watts-Phillips was
the recipient, amongst other parting offerings, of an
exquisite floral horse-shoe of white and pink roses,
cosmea, &c.
“ Martha” was revived at the Garrick, the other night,
with much riotous vocalism, but the only thing I saw to
interest me was that Cavalliera had painted herself red in
several places. Youth and beauty do not assume the form
of a crushed-strawberry blush rising like an Aurora from
the spine of the party so far as I - after a long experience
silting behind the V-shaped d.c. darling—am able to
judge ; but whenever an actress begins daubing herself
in the no-thoroughfares of her person with Chinese rouge,
it’s safe to bet that she means to look like seventeen from
the front. You can always tell the intentional juvenile
of the stage by her aspect of being brilliantly picked out
with carmine wherever she shows her clothing. Vocally,
I-like Cuttica least of all in “Martha,” but that is the
fault of the soprano music, which is peppered with tram-
signal head-notes as if the heroine wants to warn you that
she is coming round the corner. The interpolated “ Last
Rose of Summer” scored an encore and good flowers,
two excited females in a box recklessly pitching down
two corsage-sprays of autumn leaves; but some of Mrs.
C-’s business, in the semi-duet, looked as if she was trying
to exorcise Cuttica after approved spiritualistic methods.
One tiling she deserves praise for is the way she manages
the tail of her gown, which is always humbly and pro-
perly flowing behind -but I can’t say the same of
Cavalliera. It really doesn’t look the thing for an artiste
to retreat up stage with her train hanging out like a
tongue between her teeth, does it? There was a very
good house on this occasion, but the only moral to be
deduced from the d.c. was that, when you are sailing
under a most unmistakeable false front it is one of the
silliest things in the world to entangle an attractive
ornament in your borrowed bang.
Mystic dates during the current month for those who
cannot exist outside Government House, are 21st-when
the vice-regal first ball for ’92 takes place; 22nd—a
garden-party (N.B.—This looks very much like (he tactics
of a hostess of the “ waste not want not ” variety, doesn’t
it?). On the 26th, Lady Jersey will be “at home.”
Perhaps, in delicate allusion to the financial out-look in
N.S.AV., the Jerseys will entertain society at three balls
during the coming season—the second to take place on
the 12th prox.
I am told that the now much-advertised Dr. “Bing.”
Growther left Hobart for England by the Arcadia, on
April 5“ to return in a year.” Another thing I hear from
Hobart is that a local servant-girl asked her horrified
missus, who is quite a social potentate, to “bring her
borne three-penn’orth o’ shrimps ” when she went shop
p g the other day; likewise, that Miss Ackerman, tie
Yankee temperance-lecturer, stated there that she had
seen in one of the Melbourne dens fifty-seven white women
smoking opium 1
“Lord and Lady Leamington” spent a very pleasant
Sunday at one of the suburban Anglican churches during
their stay in Hobart. His Lordship graciously played (bo
organ, and “ Lady Leamington ” sang a solo. The
crowded congregation—apprised beforehand of the in-
tended visit-pronounced the performance bco-u-tiful.
The distinguished visitors were afterwards entertained by
the delighted parson. Alas, the joy of the shepherd
changed to something else when he heard of the visit
paid by the pair, the very next morning, to the “dissent,
ing establishment ” for the purpose of becoming “ united
in holy wedlock.” “ His Lordship ” was anas ted on the
evening of the day on which lie was married ; but the
charge of child-desertion made against him in Sydney
will be abandoned in favour of a more serious accusation.
The marriage of Miss Hay - a sister to Mr. John Hay,
the lucky man to whom old Dax id Berry left his vast
Shoalhavcn property—to Air. Morton, ALL. A. for Shoal-

At a soiree given one night last week by a Bolts. Point

by the guests, namely, “ringing up” on the telephone

called for? As the opera-bouffe duke says, a little lliin”-

Northern society folk, who have lately been extensively
victimised by a “travelling jeweller,” seems to bo “ m ver
give old Jewellery to a new man to re-set.” A million
temptations lurk in the melting-pot, especially for the
itinerant artist who doesn't "ant your further “favours.”
This particular impostor, by the way, was a man of re-*
source. He could converse, sing, and play the piano to
such lengths, that the Hon. So-and-So tried to introduce
him as an entertainer at Gox t. House, After which, of

On Saturday night Bland Holt’s bull-dug,
supported by an attractive company, opened at
Sydney Royal for a short season of “ Master and
Man.” Also, he remained open most of the time
the show was in progress—in fact, we have never
before seen an animal that is so seldom shut—and
selected small bits of refreshment off the'various
bad characters of the story at short intervals.
Barring the dog, none of the male characters in
this drama will ever be murdered in cold blood
for their moral excellence. In strict accordance
with the laws of melodrama the worst individual
in the whole category wears a pointed moustache,
and the best one is clean-shaved. “ Master and
Man ” was written specially for Mr. Bland Holt’s
bull-dog; and its ostensible motive is the fact
that a sweet and lovely girl, who lives in a
cottage with a bill-of-sale upon it, is really the
heiress to a great estate, but is kept out of it
owing to her mother’s marriage being a secret
from everybody except the malignant hunchback
who travels on two withered legs gone askew and
has horrid dreams. The girl herself has no idea of
her identity, and would never, in the ordinary
course of events, become aware of it, but that her
enemy is crushed by the unsupported assertion of
the funny man in the last act and by an affidavit
attested by a lunatic who has burst out of his
asylum. These facts are put in to draw attention
off the bull-dog so that he may not dawn upon the
pmblicjtoo suddenly. All through the three prin-
cipal acts the present owner of the property
harrows up the feelings of the rightful heiress by
remorseless persecution, and embezzles her child,
and runs her husband into gaol, and tries to sell
up her aunt, and nearly harasses her off her
mental basis by starting the hunchback after her
at all times and seasons, and but for the fact that
the bull-dog takes up her cause manfully and that
she has the moral support of the funny man, she
would sink under her sufferings. But just when
things are at their worst her husband escapes from
gaol; and a party of workmen try to shove the
hunchback head-first into a furnace, so that lie
repents, and becomes mad, and goes round in a
partially-boiled condition to undo bis past evil
deeds ; and the blown who stole the child has
his eye blackened in front of a public-house ; and
Bland Holt and the bull-dog rush in excitedly
with some facts which they assert they picked up
in the pocket of a person who was drunk, and
which explain everything; and the dog has to
hold himself down by the tail with superhuman
vigour, else he would leap upon the baffled villain
and eat him raw, and everybody, save the wrong-
ful owner of the property, is happy. He isn’t
happy, but he tries to assume a jaunty aspect in
the hour of ruin, only lie feels that the dog’s eye
is upon him and breaks up miserably.
* # «
The bull-dog in this gorgeous drama is
played by Beelzebub, and bis performance
throughout is beyond all praise. He fills his part
most of the time with a quiet intensity that is
very striking, but at critical moments he rises to
an impassioned fervour such as few actors can
attain. Yet he is never guilty of rant or undue
straining after effect. His part, unfortunately, is
hardly large enough to give full scope for his
talents, but be is distinctly a dog that will yet
rise to the highest rank in the profession. In
such a character as that of Othello he would
undoubtedly be a great success, and several
Othellos we have seen might take Ids part as the
bull-pup with advantage. He is ably supported
by Miss Kate Bishop and Mrs. Bland Holt, two
ladies of whom no Australian audience ever gets
weary. Bland Holt himself takes the part of
the funny-man aforementioned, and is one of
the few funny men who are funny, the
average funny-man of melodrama being as solemn
as Cain after the murder of Abel, and having
“ Ichabod ” written large all over them, only
hidden by their clothes. Also, Charles Glenny is
a picturesque and able character as the malignant
hunchback who potters along in the heroine’s
wake, and W. E. Baker makes a conspicuous
success in one of the minor characters. The rest
of the company are good, as a whole, but they are
overshadowed by the dog, and would be seen to
better advantage if associated with an animal of
smaller call In 0. Only an actor of great natural
ability can live up to a dog of the first order —in
fact most men can't even live up to a mongrel.
ct despite some small drawbacks “Master and
Man ” is an assured success, and the scenery, as
nsu>l, is magnificent and is laid on with a lavish
hand. Unit ss the bull-dog is confronted by some
altogether unexpected c'rcumstanees, the pro-
gramme will undergo no change till the 23rd.

“ Caste is still on view at Sydney
Criterion, and Anson, in his capacity as Eccles, is
still engaged in reluctantly tearing himself away
horn tlio scene of his ancient glories. But we
begin to have doubts about bis going after all. He
has played Eccles s-> long that the passions of a
crunk desire for gin and the baleful influence of a
base yearning to put his baby grandson’s caul up
the spout and drink the proceeds, seem likely to
eat into his system ami paralyse him. Therefore
there appeals to be a fair chance that he will stay
on and settle down permanently on the Criterion
stage as the unshaven Eccles, and that
“Caste ’ will go m for ever like a hypnotised
comedy ( r a fixed automaton in three acts,
and the advertisement stating that Anson is about
to quit will take root in the daily papers and stay
there till the old age of the earth. If Brough
and Boueicault desire to have a long rest from the
weariness, of scene-shifting and rehearsals, they
can't do better than engage the present company
for life, and let “Caste” go straight ahead as
long as the scenery will hold together. And when
the last performance comes along, and Brough
and Lyndal both have to play their parts on
crutches, and the infant is 40 years of age, and the
fair young mother is white-haired, and wears
spectacles, and Eccles, owing to extreme feeble-
ness, has to make ins entrances and exits on all
fours oven then “Caste” would be a paying
speculation if the Methusaleh in the office wasn’t
too (>ld and broken-up to keep the accounts
straight.

Sydney Garrick lias been shared during
the past week between the Italian Opera Co. and
Kiee's “ Evangeline” combination. The operas
chosen by the former have been
Latmnermoor ” and “Faust.” In di
Signora Cuttica, as the heroine, evoked s!' 01 *’’
demonstrations of enthusiasm; andSignorMel o'
first appearance as Enrico was more than a su ° SI ' B
H. Gassier was George Johnston’s substitnt 11

which was staged on Monday and Wtchu^ t ’
nights, was very happily cast, with Si™, ay
Cuttica as Margberita, and Signor Travagli • a
spell-binding Mephistoplieles. Signor *Qntl' a

Hiscocks’ Federal Minstrels have been
keeping the laughter and tears well pumped m,
with capital variety entertainments at the Sydnev
Polytechnic, Imperial Arcade, the new far™
addendum being that of “ The Skeleton Witness ”
whooped through by George Turner, A. Bailev
and H. Cremar, and preceded by the Horace
Bent engineering of “Laughing Gas.” Mens
D’Arc’s clever fantoccini show at the Royii
Standard continues to more than fill the bill of
public expectations and approval. The Vaude
ville Company at the School of Arts, with their
last Saturday night’s change of programme, hum
duced a new corner-man of acrobatic song-and-
dance prowess, Tom Edwards. The Blair Sisters
continue to reap a harvest of encores, and Dora
Busch has climbed another step of minstrel fame
The mythological burlesque “Ixion”is cosmo-
politan in its humours, and from prehistoric to
prophetic in its scope. The Alhambra Music-hall
draws a full breath of favour nightly, Ida Holbein
Beatrice James, and all the comic vocalists bavind
regularly to repeat their best efforts. The con-
cluding farce of “The Troublesome Chines®-” ig
highly congenial to Sydney audiences.

M. Wiegand’s Saturday and Wednesday
organ recitals have been numerously patronised
and highly appreciated. On Tuesday night the
Sydney Philharmonic Society held the Centennial
Hall, and performed the “ Hymn of Praise” and
“Stabat Mater,” the principal vocalists being
Signorina Antoinette Link, Nellie Young, Arthur
Parkinson, and F. J. Hallewell; with Signor
Ilazon conductor, and M. Wiegand organist.

The Gettysburg Cyclorama lias had a
decided boom by reason of the nightly killing if
Roy Malcolm, as soon as he has.merited his fate
by singing “On Guard,” and thus betraying his
whereabouts to the enemy. The Coogce and Bondi
Aquariums keep up their Saturday and Sunday
attractions. Coogee was rushed last Saturday, on
promise of a balloon ascent and parachute drop
by Fernandez, but, as on a former occasion, there
were an unrehearsed ignition, an insufficient
inflation, and a general fiasco.

George Rignold's brother, Bill, has left
Her Majesty's (Sydney), and that vast building is
now filled with the east wind and haunted by the
indefinite shadows of old, dead scene-shifters and
forgotten lime-light men. Next Saturday (IGth),
however, Miss Billee Barlow and her burlesque
company open in “Dick Whittington,”and there
is exceeding great joy among the gods, and
the pit riseth as one man.

“ The School for Scandal,” written by a
dead, bottle-nosed gentleman whose name is not
mentioned on the bill, has superseded “ Masks
and Faces” at Melbourne Opera House. Hie
reason for this change is not strikingly evidnit.
There was good business for ‘ Masks and Faces,
in which Mrs. Beere and her chief adherents shone
with no uncertain light, whereas the other old
comedy doesn’t display them to great advantage.
Moreover, the whole performance suffers by com-
parison with the Brough Boueicault effort of three
or four years ago, and tends to lower the prestige
of the new company. Royce and Cat heart, both
of honoured Bijou memory, are better .suited to
their parts—Uncle Oliver and Peter Teazle—than
any of the others. Young Otho Stuart, as Joseph
Surface, is not up to good amateur form, and
his face (which, under a powdered wig i*
a facsimile of Mrs. Brough’s) ridicules the
bare notion of Ids being elder brother
to such a mature reveller as Herbert Standing.
The latter actor, reviewed far apart from I"*
alleged relative, is a very acceptable Char es
Surface, and seems to have fixed himself in public
favour, anyway. Mrs. Bernard Deere contributes
a stroke of genius at the end of the famous screen
scene, but for the most part her Lady Teazle i*
not an especially fa'cinating-or convincing piJna
of the clever country girl who finishes her educa-
tion in a bad London “ School.” She is hard an'
formal throughout the giddy interview wi
Joseph, and the cool, calculating way in w | lK '
she discusses the advisability of being led astra.

Mr. Acting-Justice Heydon’s president-
ship of Sydney Criminal Court during the week,
has, on the whole, proved a great success. But
why did His Honor send Richardson up for four
years for putting his signature to a fraudulent
balance-sheet and give Kirby, who cut Ins mother's
throat, only two years? Was it because Richard-
son cooked his accounts whereas Kirby only half-
cooked his ma ?
The Chief-Justice of Victoria does not
mince matters when he speaks of the manner in
which the papers have prejudged Williams, and
should he try the case his charge to the jury will
probably embody some acrid comments on the
subject of press prosecutions. Dr. Mannington
Caffyn appears to have been entrusted with the
superintendence of the medical aspect of Williams’
defence, and there is a certainty of a big rumpus
in the medical world ere his trial comes on. The
authorities decline, as in Colston’s case, to allow
any medical witness for the defence to see the
prisoner without the presence of the Government
medical-officer, the plea being that it is likely
that the gentleman so acting might suggest to the
accused methods of dissimulation—truly a deli-
ciously complimentary estimate of the profes-
sion. There can, it is thought, be no
effectual effort to save the prisoner’s life. The
only hope of the defence probably is to prove his
criminal lunacy. Nothing has astonished indepen-
dent observers who have come into contact with
the man so much as his absolute stupidity. Wil-
liams mentally is essentially a fool, without even
the ordinary cunning of the criminal class; his
success with his late cemented wives has been due
more to luck and sheer carelessness than to any
deliberate planning. He belongs to the order of
instinctive criminals whose moral sense is as
wanting as a blind man’s sight. By the way, the
moral sense of the court full of gaping sightseers
was much more shocked when Dr. Mullen
announced that he had tried the weapon supposed
to have been used by Williams on the skull of a
dead woman than at any other incident of the
trial.

little innocents are now left outside on the mat
whilst their mothers assure themselves that it is
almost as nice and horrible as they expected. As
a matter of fact, it ought to be made a lot more
horrible. Melbourne would like the Alexandra

throats at one fell swoop.

More than once have we protested against the con-
certed trick of the Melbourne theatrical critics refraining
to mention when an artist is laid aside by illness. As, for
instance, in “ Dorothy,” habituds have been deluded witli
the idea that they were going to see Marie Halton and
Ryley, whereas they only saw Pollard and Deane. Within
a few months the critical senility to managers has been
similarly proved, in Melbourne, with regard to Billce
Barlow, Rignold, Nelly Barren, and Danby.
The Palmer dramatic company, which is doing a season
on the west coast of Maoriland, appears to have got there
under difficulties. They were weatherbound among the
Alps, sundry landslides blocked the road, and they camped
out under a deluge of rain and other horrors. The
villain and the heavy father had to dig tip the principal
heroine, who was bogged ; and the walking gentleman
nearly broke his back fishing the soaked infant pheno-
menon out of a mountain torrent. At latest they had
reached Beefton.
The hotel-keepers of St. Louis (IT.S.A) have struck
against Sarah Bernhardt. That lady readied their city
accompanied by six dogs, three snakes, and eleven birds,
and as no one would take in her menagerie she camped in
a palace car at the railway station.
At the date of latest despatches, Maggie Moore, with a

Th e Wild-Cat Column.
A new “ salting ” yarn. A. was a well-known
salter, who had a claim on a Northern field. He told
Messrs. 8., Cl and D. that he had “struck it,” and offered
to sell; he would let them test the claim in his absence.
B. went below to shoved up the dirt; C. worked the
windlass, and i>. panned out the stuff, while A. got drunk
in a township two miles away. Yet they were badly
“ had,” for halt-way down the shaft, a small chamber had
been dug behind the timbering, and A.’s youthful heir,
about 10, salted each bucket as it passed him on its road
up and down.

When the brokers themselves have no money,
stand from under. To'offer 1000 shares for sale of any
stock is to produce an avalanche. The bulk of the Sydney
brokers arc jobbers and many of these are penniless
people, to deal with whom is to act on the principle of
heads they win, tails you lose.

A newspaper which arrogates to itself wonderful
prescience when it happens to come out right in its
weekly mining market guesses, and is as silent as the grave
on its own blunders in other directions, says of the
Bonanza Consols that “ when once it strikes a good pay-
able lode the shares will take a jump ! ” Wonderful, but
true. Less wonderful but equally true that when once
one of the great number of enraged individuals who
purchased thousands of these shares (now worth two-
pence) at from Bs. to 12s. on the advice of the same
tipster strikes, something else will take a jump, too.

It is almost impossible to work a big dividend-
paying mine without throwing fortunes in the way of the
management. In this respect the big mines of Broken
Hill are the most extravagant in Australia. Baton made
more money by purchasing and selling shares at the right
moment than by his enormous salary. One of the highest
buildings in Mtlbourne is the substantial result of a
Broken Hill tip. The tipster made a fortune for himself
and fox many of his friends, who have since sworn by his
judgment. We should think so—to buy Centrals, Souths,
and Block Tens at shillings and sell at as many pounds
was certainly good business.

“There is a complete plant, including battery of
ten head, with stock of quicksilver, acids, copperplates,
blacksmith’s shop, sheds and accessories, mine, mining
tools, and I will take £lOO for the lot/’ said, a few days
ago, a disconsolate man whose mining enthusiasm had
busted.

The next mining boom will be in gold. Booms,
like mushrooms, are forced and short-lived. The gold-
boom will be forced by the world’s scarcity, and conse-
quent hunger for that metal. It will also be short-lived,
because no matter how many rich gold-discoveries may
possibly be made, people will go mad, and scarcity of the
metal which gave the boom birth will also cause its
death.

About twelve months ago the leading stocks at
Zeehan were quoted(Queens, £7 to £8; Adelaide
props., £7 to £8; Comet, 225. to 195.; Hobarfes, £45 to
£5O ; Hassett’s, 4s. to 55.; Anderson, 2s. Gd. to 35.; Aus-
tral, Bs. to 95.; Melbourne props., ss. to Gs.; Kozmiusky s,
245. to 215.; Balstrups, 10s. to 125.; Silver King, £1600;
and so on. At the present time quotations are about; —
Queens, 52i. to 555.; Adelaides, Is. Cd. to 25.; Comet, ss.
Gd. to Gs. Gd.; Ilassett’s, 4d. to 5d.; Andersons, Cd.; Aus-
tral, Is. to Is. Cd.; Melbourne props., sd. to Gd.; Kozinin-
sky’s. Is. Gd.; Balstrups, 4s. Cd. to 55.; Silver King, 425.;
whilst dozens of others selling at big figures a year ago
(companies of 100,000 and 50,000 shares) are at the present
time unheard of; in fact, those who are “minding the
baby" find it difficult to obtain any information about
them, nor can they find out where the sections are
situated. They had then hundreds of feet of “basks”
available without the aid of machinery and very little
money required. To-day there are no backs, no machinery,
no money.

Things seem about a toss-up at Zeehan, and
the future chiefly depends on the bottoming of a couple
of shafts, namely, Central Dundas and Comet, and these
with Maestries are big prospective shows and will com-
paratively make or break the field. If silver-bearing
lodes on the Barrier were a criterion the success of this
place would be assured, but they differ in every respect;
there are numerous lead-lodes at Zeehan and Dundas, but
the extraction of gangue such as zinc blend, carbonate of
iron, &0., will yet cause some terrible trouble, and, so far,
with hardly an exception, at a depth the lodes begin to
mix with base minerals. The Government have bad all
the best of it so far, extracting all the revenue they can
lay hands upon for no return. They have recently passed
a special measure for the extraction cf about £16,000 per
month for six months from Residence Areas, just at a
time when the place is fairly poverty-stricken. The
people are waking up and threaten to dynamite the whole
island rather than submit.

A cute American, who has been in turn a
temperance-evangelist, insurance-agent, and, finally, a
mining-thrillist, and all with varying financial success,
has gone back to the evangelist-temperance business. It
is said of him that he recently received an “ awakening of
the spirit.” The writer is speculating whether the spirit
would have awakened him had his silver-quartz lodes not
pinched out instead of going down, as he eloquently pre-
dicted, a thousand feet.

Three men had recently a Sydney bulk crushing
—a ton—and they refused to be consoled with the result,
which, to several persons not in the “know,” was emi-
nently satisfactory. They persisted in asking why this
disgust and dissatisfaction. “Well, you see, it was this
way,” said one of the too candid miners “we put twice
as much in the confounded stuff.” The machine was
responsible for the difference.

History, in brief, of many N.S.W. mines, born,
nursed, and dead, within the last three years. Booms
come in cycles—the bigger the boom the longer the
interval before the next. Hill End was a big boom fol-
lowed by a long cessation. The last was started by
Broken 11111. It is the easiest tiling in the world to find
silver and gold in infinitesimal quantities in any mineral
country, and as time will not allow waiting for something
good to be found, the first thing is taken. The assay of
selected samples is good, the expert’s report is better,
lying does the rest. A company is floated, a working
miner with an elasticconscience gets a billet as manager.
It is his duty tq spend money and write encouraging
reports, and he does it A few shareholders who display
even the judgment of the mule get out and receive the
sympathy of those who stay in. Calls become mono-
tonous. At last the machinery is ready and there is an
abundance of “good-looking rock at grass.” For many
unaccountable reasons crushing is delayed. At last the
day arrives and several directors go up to bring down the
cake, sometimes arranging for a police-escort to the rail-
way-station. Several hundred ounces expected, less than
fifty received. Escort discharged, the result revealed and
excused in many ways. Next crushing worse ; shares
forfeited in thousands. Meeting to consider financial
position ; another to wind-up. Liquidator appointed.
Plant, which cost £3OOO, and mine sold for £3OO.

Every penny fall in the price of silver makes a
difference of £50,000 a year to the Broken Hill Pro-
prietary mine.

Mining knowledge combined with sound judg-
ment of intrinsic value made fortunes for managers of
the Barrier, who are now left, high and dry because they
could not foresee the turn of the market tide which a
year ago they proudly imagined would carry them up to
Patou’s financial level.

Two men working together a mine and a market,
one shall be taken and the other left. Of course the man
who made money by going out is a swindler. Those who
remain in always try to kick him instead of kicking
themselves.

A telegram from Mount Stewart says : —“ Big
smelter working splendidly ; bullion assaying 140 oz. to
the ton—nine tons despatched.” Again we say this is
absolutely useless information. Why not say how many
tons of ore one ton of bullion represents, so that the
grade of the ore may be ascertained? It is all in tlie silver
and lead contents of the ore, not of the bullion, which signi-
fies nothing but ifidefinitencss, of which, after many
warnings, the poor public are sick unto death.

to any address in the colony. Fine large size for
single beds, with postage included, 12/8; extra
quality, 15/3 per pair ; superior large, for three-
quarter beds, 15/9 and 18/9 ; superfine, for double

who next morning moved the motion, which was imme-
diately granted by his father. “Why, my Lord,” said
Cooper, who was in the Court, “your Lordship refused to
grant this motion when I moved it yesterday morning.”
“But, Mr. Cooper,”- said the Chief Baron, unabashed,
“ you must admit that Mr. O’Grady put the case in a
different light.” “Oh,” said Mr. Cooper, soltu voce, “I
presume in the light of the son.”
The inhabitants of Andrew-street, WindSo r
(Melb.), rendered immortal by Deeming’s deeds,
are so insensible to fame that they want to change
the street’s name, but they are reminded of the un-
lucky attempt to obliterate Pentridge in Coburg,
and one thinks of the celebrated Joshua Bngg, who
changed his name to Norfolk Howard. Likewise
of the Rugeley people who, after Surgeon Palmer
had poisoned a man in their town, went to Lord
Palmerston and asked for leave to alter the name
of Rugeley. “Call it Palmerston,” neatly sug-
gested Pam.
John Dunn, of Mount Barker, S.A., the
other day celebrated his 90th anniversary by
giving the town of Mount Barker a park, and
DEPRECIATIVE TESTIMONY.

presenting all the employes of Dunn and Co. who
had achieved five years of service with cheques
representing sums varying according to the periods
of their connection with the firm. In recalling to
memory various reunions of the firm, the old man
reminded the men of the jolly time they had at
one Christmas picnic, when he had a big pudding,
made with two cwt. of flour and other ingredients
in proportion, passed into a boiler through the
manhole. He was not cook enough to know
that the pudding would swell, and he wouldn’t
have been" able to get it out again without first
cutting it up had it not been for the ingenuity of
some runaway sailors who wore on hand. On
another occasion, they had roasted a bullock
whole, and had to utilize a big water-wheel to
turn the roast. John Dunn boasted that his firm
had not spent .£lOO in law-disputes ever since
it started in 1844. The patriarch’s birthday
occurred on Feb. 13th, but the recent death
of his eldest son caused him to postpone tire
ceremony above referred to. At one time, he
intended to leave his men legacies at his death,
but his lawyer advised him that these would make
his will cumbersome. There were 21 managers of
the firm’s branches present; 57 employes of over
nine years’ service, and as many more over five
years.
Montague Scott, the well-known artist
whose work has for the last six or seven years
been largely seen in Brisbane periodicals, has
returned to Sydney.
It is announced by cable that the Czar
intends to take more stringent measures for the
suppression of treasonable practices in Russia.
The measures hitherto taken have consisted in
knouting the offender and then hanging him with
a rope which broke three times, so that he was
killed partly by concussion against the floor and
partly by slow and clumsy strangulation. Prob-
ably the Czar means to provide in future that the
rope shall break six times, and intends to fix a
spike under the gallows for the prisoner to fall
upon.
Tranter's Shot.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“I SHOT him like a dog !” said Tranter as he got
off his horse and proceeded to unsaddle.
“Who did you shoot?” asked the new super,
who was standing by.
“Never mind,” returned Tranter, “I’m not
going to give myself away, but I shot him like a
dog. ’
There was bad blood between Tranter and the
new super., and, as Tranter was about leaving,
he was far from respectful in his manner.
The new super, was a young man from the
South, and Tranter was an old Gulf hand.
The new super, was a black-protector, tem-
perance-advocate, and objected to swearing.
Tranter, of course, to sustain his character as an
old Gulf hand, swore the most blood-curdling
oaths in hi< presence, and told the most awful lies
ho could invent about black atrocities. Conse-
quently, they fell out, and Tranter was leaving
the station.
“Now, look here,” said the super., “I’ll get to
the bottom of this—l’ll just follow your tracks
and find out what you have been up to.”
“You’ll find him, safe enough,” said Tranter,
“ he won’t get away.”
The wrathful superintendent had his horse
brought up, and started back on Tranter’s track,
taking another man with him. The trail was not
hard to follow, as Tranter had been after horses
and they had come in along a cattle-track.
They had gone about five miles when a loud,
wailing cry suddenly startled them. They were
in scrubby country at the foot of a low, con-
glomerate rise, with many boulders about.
Following the cry they came to an old gin
seated on the ground cutting herself, or endeavour-
ing to do so, with a piece of broken glass and
occasionally uttering the wail that had first
attracted their notice. Green, the super., knew
that this was a sign of mourning, and guessed
that he was on the right track.
“There’s been murder here,” he said, dismount-
ing and approaching the gin. She took no notice
of him, but kept on moaning and scraping at her
breast.
“ Let’s look about,” said the man, “ they always
go on like this, and we can’t stop her.”
They searched awhile without result, the gin
still keeping up her lamentation. Then Green,
having made up his mind that a vile outrage had
been committed, remounted, and they cantered
back to the station.
“ I will get F ,” he said, naming the native-
police-inspector, “ to bring a trooper and search.”
The “barracks” were, only some three miles
from the station, and F was soon up there
with his smartest tracker.
Meantime, Green had been trying to get out of
Tranter what he had done with the body of his
victim,
“ I shot him like a dog, and I buried him like a
dog was all he could get in answer. “Go and
find him, he won’t run away !”
Green was infuriated, but he knew he could do
nothing until evidence of the murder was estab-
lished.
With one delay and another it was late in the
afternoon ere Green, F , and the black trooper
arrived at the scene of the tragedy. The old gin
was still sitting there raising her requiem song,
but the black boy could obtain no information
from her.
“Some fellow bin go bung,” was all he was
assured of.
They searched without avail until dusk, and
then had to depart unsatisfied, the most astonish-
ing thing being that they could find no other
black’s tracks but those of the gin. Green took
counsel with F , but he could say nothing,
except that the factof what was possibly onlyempty
blow on Tranter’s part, and the presence of the
gin raising the death-wail, was not sufficient
evidence to obtain a warrant on. For himself he
thought from what he saw that Tranter had shot
a blackfellow there, but his belief would go for
nothing. However, he slept at the station and
promised to renew the search as early as

crossed the bridge and went 2 miles up along the West
bank and camped here near where the telegraph line
crosses. Been very busy lately, discovered all last month
all this month, and intend to discover for some time to
come. We have discovered a darkskinned hlaclifellow who
seems toinfest these regions, filling theO’possom with dread
and anxiety, and the Kangaroo with a sense of nuichinsecu-
rily. Curious blacks these, their faces would appear to have
been suddenly confronted by a brick-wall sometime when
they were in a hurry. This will also account for the fact,
that they don’t hurry anymore. They have a queer slick
like a rainbow which the male black—there is a female
black—will throw out to the West in the morning and it
will come back from the East at dinnertime with 2
O possums hanging over it, or the hind-quarters of a
kangaroo, or in war-time it may return with another
blackfellow ; these thing, of course, depending on the
w ill of the operator. 1 have seen this weapon follow a
native-cat 3 times round a tree and when the Cat retired
in a hole it went back for a tomahawk. Our boss is no
look Whether these blacks are cannibals or not lam
unable to say. There was almost a panic in the camp the
other day when we heard there was no more condensed
milk, fancy being without condensed milk away out
here in these dense and impenetrable jungles near the
boundary'-fence of Gooleechi station. We were all going
on strike when the boss discovered a box of it under his
hunk. Some weeks ago we discovered a large sand hill
and also some huge gums which bore the appearance of
never having been seen before by white men We also by
lucky accident stumbled across a splendid place for a
siwmill, the only drawback being the fact that there is
no timber w ithin 90 miles of it, but our boss says this can
easily be overcome by planting trees suitable for building
purpos s and irrigating them until ready for use. This
would find work for a large number and thus this
wilderness we have opened up would scon be the
scene of busy villages and happy homes. I was ill
the front ranks when we discovered this place. We have
discovered a terrible amount of ground lately', why you
wouldn’t believe the quantity of ground I here Is in this
country if only properly discovered. Sydney, Adelaide,
and Melbourne can grow a lot yet. I can discover better
every day'. Some time ago we discovered 2 shearers with
packhorses and I tell you they were glad to see us as we
were the only white men they had met for 7 mortal
hours. They had actually existed for 49 days on tea,
sugar, flour, meat, and other things. One half the world
doesn’t know how the other half lives. Well, I must go
down to the bridge and meet Cobh and Co.’s coach. The
driver gave ns some useful information from time to time
as to the whereabouts of waterholes, outstations, hmin-
daryriders’ huts, pubs., blacks' camps, and good feed for
the camels. He also warned ns against leaving open
gates in the boundary fences, a thing about which ex-
plorers cannot be too cautious. He says we have improved
greatly these last few weeks in this respect. Well, no
more at present, will write again next month if alive.

POLITICAL POINTS
Latest betting, Victorian Speakership :
Even on Gillies, 10 to 1 against Bent.
Griffith’s Kanaka Bill virtually passed the
Bananaland Assembly by 32 votes to 7.
The “ Conservative ” party is dead for
ever in Maoriland. Henceforth it will be merely
<• Liberal or Radical ?”
Premier Shiels will probobly have a large
majority in the new Parliament. Berry, if
returned, will le nowhere in the House.
The Argus contended that the suspension
of Speight would bring down Victorian bonds.
That almost reconciled “ Dickey ” to his fate.
r l h s Play ford (S. A.) Government expect to
came out with il 12.000 surplus this year. Actual
balance ,£10,000; .£32,000 coming from last year.
Dr. Scott, candidate for Villiers and
Ileytesbury (Vic.), describes ex-Preraier Munro
as a “wicked creature with a hide like an ele-
phant.”
They say Berry’s loyalty sent him to
Brunswick, "but he falls very fiat there. Bruns-
wick could put up with a plain grocer, but a titled
grocer is too gross.
Graham Berry has swallowed the Shiels
i r >gramme excepting the minor item of the
increase of postal-rates. He out-Shiels Shiels in
demanding Civil Service reductions.
Said the late Hon. John Woods, in the
Victorian Legislature : “The Sunday trains are
required to bring the greasy saints to their super-
stition shops.” But that was long ago.
Melbourne Tories can make no more
capital out of the lie that Trades Hall candidates
are “agitators like Flynn,”inasmuch as Flynn has
scratched himself for his South Carlton engage-
ment.
From a pugilistic r point of view, honours
appear to have been about equal in last week’s
Queensland Parliamentary lobby-tight between
members North and Uoolan arising out of the
Kanaka debate.
An impudent circular has travelled round
the Victorian civil servants urging them to “spot,”
as voteis, the candidates who would reduce their
pay. The Cabinet is furious. “We have 30,000
votes,” says the circular.
Clever, ready David Gaunson has decided
very late in the day to stand again for his old
constituency—South Melbourne. We hope to see
him elected. David was a thorn in both sides, but
the public benefited by it.
At an election-meeting down South :
Candidate : “I am in favour of a special vote for
Thrift; I believe that thrift should be rewarded.”
Coarse elector : “That’s why you are so blanky
thrifty with your soap, perhaps.”
The squattocracy of Toorak (Melb.) have
transferred their political confidence to Alexander
M'Kinley (part proprietor of proputty’s pictorial
organ, Punch), now that Matthew Davies has
finally decided not to risk a crushing defeat at the
poll.
That shrinking violet, Harper, decrying the
Shiels’Ministry:—“The idea of Wheelertakingthe
portfolio of Minister of Railways ! Why, even I
would think twice before taking such a momentous
step.” Talk about a vote for Thrift. Why not
give Harper one for his modesty ?
Poor old Jack Gardiner, member for
“ football,” is evidently doomed in favour of
Bromlev, labour-candidate. His meeting greeted
him with howls and yells, and actually laughed at
his time-honoured “I played for Carlton ten
years ago.” Poor Jack is in favour of every thing,
if they will only put him in. But they won’t.
J. G. Drake’s amendment that Griffith’s
Kanaka Bill be read a second time six months
hence, was, of course, lost —by 31 to 16. Allowing
for three vacancies (Musgrave, Bulimba, and the
prospectively vacated Burrum) two absences in
England (Archer and Ferguson), and the Speaker’s
non-vote, nine available members were absent
from a division which countenanced slavery.
James Campbell, ex-M.L.A., champion
Victorian advocate of some-men-two-votes, has,
despite the support of the Victorian National
Association and Young Victorian Paper collar
League, been badly beaten on bis own dung-hill
—Benalla and Yarrawonga—by a hitherto un-
known local man. The second-vote-for-bricks-
and-mortar politically slow Campbell.
No more Chinese are allowed to enter
the United States. From 1855 to ’67 the yellow
agony dribbled in at from 3000 to 7000 a year;
from ’6B to ’Bl it mounted to from 10,000 to
20,000. In 1882 there were 33,614, but then came
a Restrictive Act, and in 1883 there were only
381, and in 1886, but 17. Yet, in 1888, came the
Act to exclude all Chinese workmen, and even
that isn’t enough.
Premier Griffith’s comfort to Queensland
workers :—“Make up your minds to accept lower
wages; take whatever wages you can get and
work will be found for you.” And then?
The Silver Age (Broken Hill, N.S.W.)
running a Separation movement on its own
account. It advocates the creation of the Barrier
District into an independent province. The way
in which the N.S.W. Government has blown hot
and cold alternately in respect to the Broken Hill
water supply has done more than anything else to
give the lately formless void of the agitation
definite shape and cognisable dimensions.
Anent Moderator White’s late deliverance,
somewhere in his “History of the Girondists”
Lamartine apostrophises : —“The Church, that
sycophant who ever allies herself to Power and
Oppression!” Apart from this, is it not note-
worthy how circumscribed is the average sacerdotal
vision when jolted out of its rut ? Let the “cloth ”
but open its mouth in secular counsel, and we see
how little it concerns itself with the hard, mun-
dane problems of life.
Dear Bulletin, —Why not advocate tho
abolition of fines as an alternative to imprison-
ment? A case occurred in Melbourne the other
day where a man was prosecuted for an aggravated
assault on an old woman. Prior to opening pro-
ceedings he offered .£lO to square the affair. The
bench, however, merely fined him 40s. and he went
his way chuckling. The “fine” alternative is
merely a device for rendering tire rich independent
of the law, which becomes applicable only to poflr
persons.—Yours &c., Chas. Junoe.
At South Melbourne Town Hall last week,
a voter with a wild, beery eye introduced a novelty
in election-meeting humour. He climbed upon
the platform, and solemnly asked for a drink of
wafer from the candidate’s bottle. The flow of
eloquence was interrupted whilst the Mayor came
forward and served this strange apparition with a
quencher, wh reupon he turned to rejoin the
meeting, and fell off the platform with great
dramatic effect. fThe water had upset him.
Some arguable excuse might be made for
land-grant railways if the State paid for the mere
work of railway-construction in land, instead of in
money. But the Queensland and West Australia
proposals are that syndicates shall be paid in land
WITH THE MORNING’S MILK.
Mistress, whose domestics never stay long with her, attends to the miikhoy personally one morning.

to make railways and then should own these rail-
ways. Further, that the State should afterwards
buy back these railways at fancy prices. This is
like paying an architect in land to build a house
on other land and then making him a present of
this other land and bouse so paid for, and after-
wards buying the house and its site at top market
prices.
It is again rumoured that “ Lilley of the
Valley ” will come down from the bench into the
political fighting arena at the conclusion of the
protracted law-suits now before him. If he does
so one cause of his resignation will, no doubt, be
the fact that he does not wish to prejudice the
barristerial career of his son, to whose constant
appearance before him in court strong objection
has -been taken. And in the masterful Chief-
Justice’s possible early resignation, may, perhaps,
be seen the chief reason why the Kanakilgnff is
so eager to reinstitute black slavery in Banana-
laud without consulting the electors,
A Maoriland Conservative, named John
Grigg. announces in the papers that he—Grigg—
is offended at sundry statements of a democratic
character made by Governor Onslow in his vale-
dictory speech, and arises to protest against them.
“If I had been present,” says Mr. Qrigg, “I
would have risen and simply said, ‘ What, sir, are
you saying?’ and then I would have left the
room.” And then, we presume, the lights would
have turned blue, and Onslow and all his family
would have fallen down dead, with a resounding
crash, and hairy spectres would have fled across
the table accompanied by wailing ghosts and old,
earth-smelling skeletons, and there would have
been alarms and incursions, and tumultuous
horror would have brooded over the scene
generally.
Little Nuttall, who will stand for West
Richmond (Melb.) on the Progressive League
ticket, is a very fountain of co-operation statistics
and a powerful talker on all labour questions.
Regarded simply as an apostle of the working-
man, Billy Nuttall wants a lot of beating, and
although (judging from his services to the defunct
Equitable Co-operative Society) he would make
the worst premier on record, he is eminently well
qualified to attack each and every Government at
its weak spots. Moreover, Nuttall has the re-
commendation of being a natural Republican,
who would never wish to dine with Lord Hope-
toun, or any other bloated aristocrat, except,
perhaps, for the sake of revenging himself upon
the vittles.
One Macplievson, an alleged Radical can-
didate for Dandenong and Berwick (Vic.) got
upon his large, fiat, abused feet, the other night,
to explain that he was “ in favour of one-man-one-
vote, as all men are equal in God’s sight and the
Queen’s sight.” Asked to explain what the
dickens his Gracious Sovereign had to do with the
equality of man, this democratic groveller replied,
“She gave us the land.” The torpid denizens of
Dandenong were struck by the passing idea that
Macpherson was an ass, and laughed, but they
gave a respectful hearing to the rest of his drivel,
and seemed to think they had got hold of a first-
class politician to save their bleeding country.
Victoria must be in a parlous state when a Mac-
pherson can pass as a valuable specimen of
advanced liberalism in the sight of God and the
Queen.
Kanakilgriff s (Q.) Pacific Island Labourer 8
Extension Bill repeals the old clauses providing
stoppage of Kanaka immigration, and pretends to
Restrict the slave-trade by providing that “ ‘ tropical
r semi-tropical agriculture ’ shall not include any
work in connection with the cultivation of maize,
or the work of ploughing, or any work done
within a sugar-factory or sugar-refinery.” The
.Bill permits Kanakas to be re-engaged immediately
one term of agreement expires, and deals with
paying (in goods or money) wages due to dead
Kanakas to their relatives or friends in the islands.
Better order them to be paid to the Man in the
Moon. The “Polynesian Fund” has been a
standing joke of yore in Queensland—an instru-
ment specially devised for the greedy embezzler
and defaulter.
Lieut.-Colonel Rowe will sue the N.S.W.
Government for .£7OOO, his commission as an
architect on <£147,000, the contract-price for erect-
ing the proposed Sydney Hospital.
Moody and Sankey were not appreciated
at Blairgowrie, Scotland, a few weeks hack. They
were to perform in a church, on a Wednesday
night, against the minister’s grain, and so he said,
on the Sunday before, “Such of you as have
valuable Bibles and hymn-books had better take
them home.”
“ Bob ” Lyons, solicitor, of Rockhampton,
Q., died on Bth inst. He was a prominent Central
Queenslander, was lured into Parliament by the
Billy-Pattison clique in ’BB, and was further
induced by alleged friends to invest at boom
prices in Mount Morgan gold shares, on 12-
months’ bills, which ruined him in .’B9 to the
extent of sending his estate to the hammer, and
causing him to resign his parliamentary seat.
Last year, he was the solicitor employed in the
defence of the unionist shearers who were legally
“persecuted” by the Coalition Government, of
which good-dog Towzer was the particular depart-
mental deputy for the “military operations.”
We have received from the publishers,
Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, the Australian
Handbook for 1892. It is an elegant volume in a
green cover, with an emu and a kangaroo on the
back, and a golden sun rising in the distance. The
interior or bowels of the publication contains a
vast fund of information concerning Australia,
Maoriland, Fiji, and the outlying islands. It in-
cludes a description of every town, from 40 in-
habitants upwards, throughout these provinces,
maps of every place, masses of hard fact about
tariffs, banks, cab-fares, consuls, ambassadors,
Agents-General, federation, Australian securities,
mails, Mahommedans, newspapers, population,
hogs, rainfall, stamp-duties, churches, municipali-
ties, minerals, climate, excise, land-regulations,
shipping, governors, telegraphs, tramways,
revenue, live-stock, natural history, parcels post,
drawbacks, philanthropy, and lots of other sub-
jects. There is nothing in it that can bring a blush
to anybody’s cheek, and the volume can bo put
into the hands of the young without any fear of
moral contamination. The interest is sustained
to the end, and the story winds up happily.
The Possicker.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I often think of straight, old Lanky Dan,
A fossicker whate’er fate might bequeath him ;
A grim and grizzled worshipper of “ pan,”
Who deemed all other industries beneath him.
Bare-boned and hard, with thin, long hair and beard,
With horny hands that gripped like iron pliers ;
A clear, quick eye, a heart that nothing feared,
A soul full simple in Us few desires.
No hot, impatient amateur was Dan,
Sweating to turn the slides up every minute—
He knew beforehand how his stuff would pan.
Could tell by instinct almost what was in it.
I’ve known him stand for hours and rock and rock,
Swinging now the shovel, now the ladle,
So sphinx-like that at time he seemed to mock,
Resolved to run creation through his cradle.
And when the sun burned fiercely, like a flame,
Or when the rain ran dancing on the river,
He churned the wash or cradled on the same
For cold and heat alike Dan thanked the Giver.
No sun-shafts pricked him through his seasoned hide,
Nor cold nor damp could bend his form heroic ;
Bare-breasted Dan the elements defied,
And met all fortunes like a hoary Stoic.
Where there were tailings, tips, and mangled fields,
And sluggish, sloven creeks meandering slowly ;
Where puddlers old and sluice-sites promised yields,
There Lanky might be found, contented wholly.
E'en tho’ they’d worked the field, as Chinese do,
Had “ bulled” each shaft and scraped out every gutter,
Burnt every stick and put the ashes through,
Yet Dan contrived to knock out bread and butter,
And something for a dead-broke mate—such men
As Dan have little love for filthy lucre ;
His luxury was a whisky now and then.
And now and then a friendly game of euchre.
They tell me he is dead: “On top? That’s so,
Died at the handle, mate, which is accordin’
As he should die, an’ if you’re good you’ll know
Dan’s pannin’ prospects in the River Jordan.”

Robert Barber appeared before Judge
Bundey (S.A.) last week, and got seven years for
stealing a dressing-case. Barber annexed the
article from an open window, pawned it for 45.,
and went to Adelaide police-station and gave
himself up.
Cabled that the U.S. Consular Court at
Yokohama (Japan) lias justified the slaying by
Naval-Lieut. Hetherington of an English banker
who seduced that officer’s wife. When “women’s
rights ” are formulated into a practical code, this
standard of justifiable homicide would necessarily
include the killing of one woman by another for
seducing the latter’s husband, wouldn’t it? Again,
if a woman bo held guiltless of the violent death
of a man who attempts her honour, in what legal
estimation should a man be regarded who killed a
wicked woman with designs upon him? In all
these matters, as in the ease of the coming accouche-
ment in prison of Mrs. Osborne, the pearl-thief,
Man, according to his present lights, does not and
cannot consider the sexes as being upon the same
plane of responsible volition.
What People Say.
MRS. MORTON SMITH, MARY-
BOROUGH, QUEENSLAND.
Writes ; “ Having for many years lived a life of
misery, and never during that time to have known
a moments freedom from pain, I am so grateful
for the benefit I have derived from Clements
Tonic, that I write the following particulars of
my case : About four years ago I was attacked
with facial neuralgia, so acute that I was unable
to sleep for 17 days. 1 lost flesh very rapidly and
was reduced to a shadow, and my family thought
tiie end was near, so weak, pale and miserable
had I become ; I could see their anxious looks and
hear them sobbing when away from me, but before
my face they were all courage and smiles, so
thoughtful were they of my feelings. I had three
doctors, but they did me no good; the misery
still continued. At last a friend recommended
Clements Tonic so strongly that I procured a
bottle; and after the third dose the pain was
relieved. I continued its use and took a good
many bottles and gradually recovered my wasted
strength, and am now as well as ever I was in my
life. lam sure Clements Tonic is the sole cause
of my being alive, for even the doctors told my
family that it would be better to settle my earthly
matters as the end was near; but thanks to
Clements Tonic they were wrong again.
“Mrs, Morton Smith.”
We thank Mrs. Smith for allowing us to publish
her testimony. Fancy the misery and torture of
■sleeplessness for a period of seventeen days, wake-
fulness being enforced by the agony of neuralgia,
and all the time an infallible remedy within reach.
We trust her letter will bring the same relief to
other sufferers.

Sociery
Why didn't the daily papers give the
names of the “ladies” who, for sheer plea-
sure, attended the big Melbourne lust-and-
murder show —the sweet creatures who laughed
so loudly when the witness deposed that he
told “Williams” that he would hang “as
sure as God made little apples ” —and, who
screamed so shrilly from their sense of “ outraged
decency ” when the miserable prisoner told the
coroner to put the verdict in his pipe and smoke
it? It would be well to have a catalogue of the
harpies present on pleasure bent, because when
Woman Suffrage has come and women get their
“rightswe shall know where to procure a hang-
woman or two.
» * •
Frederick Bayley Deeming knows in his
hearth of hearths whether he is guilty or not,
* * *
The “lady journalists” came out very
strong at the Windsor murder inquest, and sat
round the prisoner with open note-books as big as
ledgers. Each brainy lady had a fixed glare in
her eye, which seemed to defy the heavy villaifi of
the piece, and say : “You wouldn’t do it to me,
sir ! ” Williams’ optical reply said, “ I wouldn’t
like to.”
* * m
F. B, Deeming : “ My dear little wife is
not dead at all. She has only gone for a trip, and
will return by-and-bye to heap confusion on all
you liars.” And what about “ loving Katie ?”
* # #
Marshall Lyle has seized on the published
fact thatj Deeming was known as “Mad Fred.”
in his youth, and is working up an “insanity ”
defence. Already he has cabled to England for
the early life of his client, and means to ask for an
adjournment on 22nd inst., when the case comes
on in the Criminal Court.
* * *
The Wollongong (N.S.W.) Argus can
spare time to devote a leader to the price of milk,
while the Williams-Deeming horror still spirts
gouts of gore; of which, not a stray syllable in the
issue. Thank Heaven, there is one Australian
country editor whose mind remains childlike dur-
ing the Boom of Blood.
» * «
What steps, we wonder, does Police-Com-
missioner Chomley intend to take with regard to
the “ revelations ” of that reliable officer, Detec-
tive Brandt concerning Deeming’s South African
career ?
# # *
Deeming’s detectives drove him from St.
Kilda pier to Melbourne via Andrew - street,
Windsor, the scene of the murder, but Frederick’s
face, though carefully watched, gave no sign.
Which reminds one that when Cunningham, the
cold-blooded murderer of “Frank the Austrian,”
was being escorted from Port Douglas (Q.), where
he was arrested, back to Thorn borough, on the
Hodgkinson, near where the crime was com-
mitted, the party camped for a night at the very
tree under which Mr. Cunningham slew his man.
And Police-Inspector Icely carefully chained up
Mr. Cunningham all night to that tree.
# * #
Whispered that the Argus murder-wires
from Perth were “ tapped ” by another paper at
Albany, where all messages are “ repeated.”
Some I ami pennce in the Argus wires were also
evident in the other paper. Purely coincidence,
of course !
• * #
Deeming’s library, so far as can be ascer-
tained, consisted of a “History of the Inquisition,”
the “ Criminal Calendar,” and the Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, which hitherto stately journal has
disgusted its daily contemporaries by the en-
thusiasm with which it has revelled in the “ sensa-
tionalism ” which (in other people) it is ever wont
to denounce. By the way, there was a project
afloat in Sydney the other day for the establish-
ment of a Police News, but the scheme didn’t
come off. No wonder. Now that the Herald is
fairly “ on the job ” there is no room for anything
else in the blood-and-thunder line.
By the way, the London Times, during the
progress of Dr. Neild’s peep-show, had 2000
words cabled from Melbourne daily. And it
howled for more.
« * *
The newspaper-man whom Williams loudly
asked, at the Coroner’s court, for “that five
shillings he owed him over the last game of nap”
must have blushed considerably. By the way, on
a beam in the cabin occupied by Williams on the
R.M.S. Ballarat is still to be seen the accused’s
pencil record of his Nap account. The ship
people are not painting this over but are taking it
to England as a curiosity.
• # •
Hero is a charming hunk of medical evi-
dence which turned up at the Windsor murder
inquest: “ Dr. Mullen deposed that as to the axe
he would not like to say it produced the cut on
the back of the head. Nor would he like to say
that this particular axe could have produced a
depressed fracture of the skull. It could certainly
produce a very serious fracture of the skull, for he
had tried it on a dead body. 1 ’ Charming occupa-
tion, going round putting heads on dead men with
an axe just to see how the blessed thing would
work, dontcherknow»
• • #
Nothing and nobody, except himself, can
prevent Deeming’s committing suicide, however
strict and unceasing the surveillance. It is a
truism that true love takes no cognisance of the
merit or demerit, the humanity or inhumanity,
the morality or criminality, of its object; and
that it is strengthened by the trouble or danger of
the beloved. Deeming requested an interview with
his quondam sweetheart, saying that upon her
answers to certain questions that he would ask
her at this interview depended his subsequent
happiness. She proved the amount and the
constancy of her affection by refusing to grant the
interview. The coldness of her reply is quite
sufficient to break the heart of a man with Deem-
ing’s egregious vanity. He can, at any time he
likes, let the lady’s cruelty begin to operate, and
become subject to a violent outburst of grief, and
let his heart give two or three tremendous thumps
against his ribs, and split, and thus spill his blood
all over his lungs, and saturate his thorax. In
short, he can commit suicide by sentiment.
• * *
In re Deeming’s alleged secret marriage
in Sydney to a girl under 21 years, whom he abso-
lutely deserted within a month, the clergyman
who officiated at the marriage and tells the story
appears to have inculpated himself rather seriously.
Even though he conformed with all the prescribed
regulations fixed by law, he seems to have re-
A POLICE REPORT.
No. 4792: “Ye’ll be a heavy smoker, Dinny.”
No. 4793; “No oi don’t smoke much; oi buys two figs ivery Satherday nuight and they
lashts me a month.”
No. 4792; “Thin ye must have a lot left at the end of the year beyant.”
No. 4793: “Dlvil a bit; oi smokes the lot of it.”
framed from making enquiries after his own
admitted doubts had been excited as to the girl’s
youthfulness, and he certainly kept silent concern-
ing the false declaration and the scoundrelly hus-
band after he had become aware of the peculiarities
attendant on the ceremony he had performed. A
quiverful of comments might be made on this
instructive little story, but the average reader is
invited to supply them for himself. Apropos, the
good clergyman’s story leaks badly at the point
where he says the wife told him her husband had
said he was going up-country on a “ plumbing-
trip.” Deeming in his relations with women
never talked about plumbing or lead. He always
talked about diamonds and gold-mines.
# * #
Will Miss Kounsevell now go back
to her first love, the Brisbane young man ?
We don’t know who he is, but we can see him
kicking himself when he reads this.
The young lady aforesaid escaped several things
besides being cemented in the bonds of holy matri-
mony by not going to Yilgarn, We have met a
man just returned from that region. He says it
is an awful, barren place, which wouldn’t grow
even a thistle, and where he had to walk 30 miles
to water his horse.
• • »
Up to date, every witness in the Deeming
case has identified everything put before him,
barring one man, who didn’t seem to be dead
certain about the canary. When the average
witness gets fairly started on an exciting case, he
goes the whole hog. If you bring up forty men
to swear to a first-class murderer, and each one of
them only got a passing glimpse of him in the
dusk some three years before, thirty-nine of them
will testify to him right off, and the other one
will only be troubled with a very slight hesita-
tion. When they once get started they will
identify the old boots he had on in 1876,
and the shirt he sent to be washed at the time
of the Crimean War, and a brick out of the house
he lived in when a boy, and never once turn a
hair. Some of them, if they got sufficiently
excited, would identify his breath in a bottle.
The identification business goes altogether too
easily. If one or two witnesses would be just a
shade less positive now and then the public would
have a lot more faith in it; as it is, there is a
lurking suspicion abroad that when once a man is
put in the dock, not only everybody who saw him,
but also everybody who didn’t see him, is ready
to rush forward and swear for the mere thrill of
the tiling. /
I • # *
Melbourne Age, Telegraph, Herald, and
Standard, and Sydney Evening News (the last-
named under an effective nom de mer) were “per-
mitted ” by the “ authorities ” to get up at 5 a.m.
on the Ist of April and board the Lady Loch at
Williamstown. They were also permitted to
labour under the delusion that Mr. Fred. Deeming
was to be received on board from the Ballarat and
landed either at Mordialloc or Bellarine Gardens
in the dead of the night, and they had provided
themselves with overcoats, cough-drops, and mos-
quito-nets accordingly. And, furthermore, no
obstacle was placed in the way of their paying
heavily for breakfast on the Government steamer,
said Government being evidently in earnest in its
policy of retrenchment.
The Sydney D.T. reports the discovery of
a small “ battlcaxe ” among Deeming’s effects.
“Battleaxe” is good, bat we badly want to know
why that bloodthirsty paper didn’t also discover a
stinkpot and a harpoon, a few cross-bows, a suit
of chain mail, a war-horse, a torpedo, some sub-
terranean mines, a war-whoop tied up in brown
paper, sundry entrenchments in a band-box, and
an old Roman galley. These things would have
lent an air of completeness to an otherwise bald
and unconvincing narrative.
* # #
The Earl of Meath, who arrived in the
same steamer as Deemiug, with a missus and a
mission to (Heaven help us !) socially reform Aus-
tralia, is a slender, long-bearded and very bald
brunette, who reads his “addresses” from large
square sheets of MS., which occasionally go
astray and give the “ peroration ” spasms. Meath’s
voice is clear and sing-songy, his matter flowery,
and his ideas dear old friends.
# # *
The number of, as yet, well-dressed men
who atop the passer-by and shame-facedly ask fo
“a little bit of tobacco,’’ is increasing in Melbourn
every week. Tobacco dulls the pangs of hunger
for a time.
* * #
Miss Margaret Whyte has beaten all the
male students at Melbourne University in the
finals for medicine and surgery, and now the
Hospital committee is fighting over the admission
of lady resident doctors.
Some of the recent great fraud discoveries
have been made by the merest of flukes, like that
by which the career of the Penshurst (Vic.) big
bank-defaulter was out short some years ago. The
books had been so well “cooked ” that the bank-
inspector had no hesitation in passing them.
However, the manager and the inspector visited
that evening the home of the shire secretary,
where a jolly time was spent. Just ere the party
broke up the conversation turned bn the prosperity
of the district, the secretary instancing that the
shire had £4OOO at its credit. That simple remark
landed the banker in gaol: the inspector remem-
bered noting that the council had only £4 at
credit. So next morning, just as the manager was
about to see him off, and was slapping himself on
the back, the inspector remarked that he “ would
take another look at the books.”
# # •
Birregurra (Vic.) has a curiosity in the
shape of an old gentleman who will be 100 years
old next June, should all go well. He has a large,
well-made coffin ready for himself, which he pre-
pared, however, only some six years ago. He is a
bachelor, lives in a little two-roomed cottage on
some GO acres of freehold, and keeps the coffin on
the rafters of his bedroom —rather a nice prospect
on waking in the morning. The old gentleman is
hale and hearty, and drives into Birregurra every
week by himself, getting in and out of the trap by
the aid of a box which he drops out of, and draws
into, the conveyance by a rope. He is proud of
his old age, and is running for the Victorian
record. Rumour says tiiat when he was making
the coffin he tried it on and got stuck in it, where
he remained for some time, till a neighbour called
and helped him out.
* * *
Yet another Sunday paper is contem-
plated in Sydney. One of the enterprising pro-
moters has hitherto had something to do with
Woman ; the clever pressman named as prospec-
tive editor has in his time had a little to do with
wine. Let ’em call it Wink and Woman.
And, by the way, there is talk of one of the
Sydney Sunday papers changing hands. It is a
ghastly thing to be an “ amateur ” newspaper-
proprietor. It costs so much to learn the business.
* * *
The Bulletin has received from Messrs.
E. and W. Stewart, jewellers, of Launceston
(Tas.), a circular to the following effect :
We have secured the contract for the supply of the
medals presented to exhibitors at the Tasmanian Inter
national Exhibition. We notice from the list of awards
that The Bulletin has secured a first award which entitles
you to a gold-medal, and as the gold-medals are supplied
at the cost of each exhibitor, we write to ask you to for-
ward cheque or bank draft for the sum of £4 65., price of
medals and cost of postage on same, on receipt of which
we will forward in return per mail a gold-medal. If
desired we can supply gilt-medals to represent gold iu
cases for 12s. each.
We haven’t sent the cheque yet, but wo desire to
ask one or two questions. In the first place we
have several distressed acquaintances who, through
poverty, extreme old age, or gradual decay of the
mental faculties, were unable to exhibit at the
Tasmanian International Exhibition, but who
have a great desire for medals to soothe their last
hours ; also we know a man who is undeservedly
in gaol, and another who sleeps in the Domain, and
who both badly need a medal to help them to bear
up. Therefore we want to know whether, sup-
posing we take ten medals, the firm is prepared to
make any reduction. Also, in the second place, if
we were to take two tons of International Exhibi-
tion medals in order to award one to each of our
leading contributors, what price would the firm be
prepared to accept. Thirdly, we want a quota-
tion for silver medals and certificates of merit-
say 200 of each. Lastly, we want to know -vyhab
price the firm will charge to sell the whole con-
tract, so that we will have the business in our own
hands, and then any time we feel depressed we
can award ourselves a first-class gold medal to keep
our spirits up.

Ab a Sydney theatre the other night a
stout lady, during au interval, “jumped ” a man’s
seat, from which she transferred his mackintosh
to her own lap. On his return she offered him
the mackintosh, without the seat. He would have
both or neither; and, if she refused to do as ho
asked, he would prosecute her for theft, having
found her in possession of his property without
his permission. “ But I don’t want the mack-
intosh,” she shrieked. “Of course not, now
you’re found out!” said he; “but 1 find ray pro-
perty shifted from where I left it, and you’ve got
it, which is enough to enable me to call a police-

A Sydney music-seller advertises in the
daily papers that he wishes to return his best
thanks to a lady with a little boy, who called at
his shop, and overhauled and utterly disarranged
.£5O worth of music so that it had all to be sorted
over again by the assistant, and having finally
bought one piece at threepence, paid for it with a
bad shilling, and got away with ninepeuco change.
This is the most surprising instance of gratitude
we know of.

James Swan, of Brisbane, left £20,000 to
the Queensland Baptist Association subject to his
wife s life interest in same. A local law requires
the attestation by three witnesses of all such
bequests, also their registration within a month
of testator's death. Neither condition having
been complied with, the Association finds itself
badly “left” and completely dependent on the
pleasure of Mrs. Swan. How civil the clergy will
be to that lady !

Editor Bulletin, —A married woman owns
two houses in a Melbourne suburb; her husband
engages one of her tenants to work for him, and
owes him <£B 3s. for work and labour done. Said
tenant is in arrears of rent £5 175.; balance due
to him by right, £2 6s. Instead of his receiving
this amount, the wife puts bailiffs in, seizes furni-
ture, &c., and sells the poor devil up- for the
husband will not pay him his wages. Is marriage
a failure ? — Stkingybark.

Says Gi R. Sims, apropos to the maudlin
drivel inspired by the case of Mrs. Osborne, the
culchawed necklace-stealer :—“ It must be remem-
bered that for the crimes poor women commit
they have a dozen excuses, whereas a lady has
none. If the history of some of the poor, degraded
wretches who figure at the police-courts could be
written up by a sentimentalist in the Daily Tele-
graph, there would be thousands of hearts which
would feel pity for them.- But these poor crea-
tures don’t get any sympathy—they are not
interesting, and they are poor.” Yes, even their
crimes are commonplace. They prig strings of
onions, instead of strings of pearls.
An English society paper reports, among
the confessions of a fashionable lady, that she had
attended over 800 dances in search of a hus-
band, and all she found was fourteen attacks of
"bronchitis, three of pleurisy, and about a hundred
colds in the head. After all this frantic exercise
on the light fantastic toe, she remains a spinster
to this day. Also, she has lost tier complexion
through exposing her spine to innumerable
draughts, and her nose has become red through
tight-lacing, and some of her internal organs have
been entirely danced out of place, and she is an
old rack of bones and subject to chronic rheu-
matism. The woman who goes hunting for a
husband now-a-days in England lias about as
bright a prospect as- if she were running after a
bunyip with a dark lantern.
* * tt
Says S.M. Herald
It is not so certain after all that it is absolutely neces-
sary to put persons accused of not very desperate crimes
into a criminals’dock, and thus assume them to be any-
thing but innocent before they are proved to be guilty.
But when shall we have a Judge with enough
sense of justice and enough nerve to break
through the rule which compels an accused man
to go behind the spikes? It is open to any one of
Australia’s Judges to make a commencement in
this direction.

The ferry-service in Sydney harbour is so
congested that a hideous accident through collision
is merely a matter of time. Twenty times a day,
four or five boats leave Sydney Cove at the same
minute; and the breaking of the rudder-chains of
one of these at a critical moment might occasion a
hecatomb. The skippers of the steamers would
tell the Marine Board this, if they were diploma-
tically whispered to while their employers were
away.

Most Australian Judges accept the evi-
dence of bank-officials as “experts” in hand-
writing. The late Judge Gillies, of Maonland,
had a very poor opinion of the bank-clerk as an
authority on this subject, and invariably, in cases
before him, lithographic artists were called to give
their opinion concerning signatures. Judge
Gillies was probably right. Pew forgers can
“ dasli off ” a signature—in nine cases out of ten
a forged signature is laboriously copied just in the
same way as a lithographer copies signatures is
the exercise of his calling. A lithographer aided
by a magnifying-glass can ahvays tell a copied
signature. The conclusion is obvious.

Graham Berry has said something definite
at last. He would gi ve a vote to every woman
who works for her living.
One of Melbourne’s delusions is that
parents contribute to the support of unruly
children committed to the industrial schools. The
magistrates bounce, and dodging propagators and
trixes cringe, but know it’s all humbug, for the
Government has written off about <£20,000 of debt
on this score. Meanwhile, Paterfamilias reads the
bounce in his morning paper, and says, “Ha!
Quite right! Our magistrates think of the poor
taxpayer.”

It is a surprising circumstance that among
all the auditors who have been arrested of late for
certifying to false balance-sheets issued by bogus
banks, not one has put in a plea of insanity, com-
plicated by epileptio fits. It is about the most
reasonable plea that such an auditor could put in,
and we hope that the next one will take the hint.
Homicidal mania is already a recognised com-
plaint, but arithmetical mania, with a diseased
tendency on the part of the patient to state that
the securities are all right when they aren’t, is a
matter that hasn’t been fully investigated. The
mentally-distorted w'retch, who inherits his ten-
dency towards auditing from a long line of com-
mercially misshapen ancestors, ought to be an
interesting study.

The Salvation Army is no longer the
humble, patient, forbearing institution it used to
be; now that it is growing rich it puts On airs.
Its latest development is at Eidsvold (Q.), where
a “soldier” had to be hauled off a little boy,
whom he was attempting to smash because lie
“laughed during the service.” The local paper
remarks that the same meek and rowdy Christian
was recently fined at the police court for assaulting
a cow with an axe. Probably the cow laughed
too.

Melbourne paper :—•
The jury found prisoner guilty, and Judge Hodges sen-
tenced Hunziker to 12 months’ imprisonment in Geelong
gaol, and a private whipping of 15 lashes. After luncheon
his Honor, however, remitted the latter portion of the
sentence:—
M‘Crovv, convicted at Sydney last week of
the murder of his wife, is probably mad; lie comes of
a mad family. He should not be hanged, unless
the Government are prepared to poll-axe all
lunatics; Hr. Milford, whose word is unquestion-
able, deposed that M‘Crow’s brother (executed for
murder 20 years ago) was suffering from mental
delusions a fortnight before he committed the deed
for which he was judicially butchered. The crime
of murderer M'Crow the second is almost on all-
fours with that of murderer M'Crow the first.
In the Fortnightly Review, Professor
Lombroso writes about the physical insensibility
of Women* On the question of sensibility to pain
he is clear that woman is inferior. He quotes
Carle to the effect that the majority of women
allow themselves to be operated on with astonish-
ing insensibility, almost as though the body under
the surgeon’s knife were that of another and not
their own; and Dr. Mela to the effect that men
swoon in the dentist’s hands oftener than women.
The average of woman’s life is decidedly longer
than man’s; but the outward expression of moral,
if not physical pain, is more vehement in woman
than in the majority of men.
Trust the housewife for knowing what
suits her best, and when she tells you that a
“New Home ” sewing-machine is equal to a
maid-of-all-work, a written promise of marriage
and a watchdog combined, go straight away and
interview J. W. Johnston & Co., sole agents for
Australia, whose machines have had a reputation
—for 15 years at Haymarket, Sydney, 4 years in
Brisbane, and 3 years in Melbourne, in which
city, by the way, a retail establishment has been
opened to fulfil the orders crowding in. The
“New Home” machines are manufactured by
thousands in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and the
Sewing Machine News (New York) recently
noted that an order for them had been received
from Paris (France) for 15,000 in one consignment,
to be delivered within 00 days. The “ New
Home ” can do every kind of work required by
the most accomplished needle epicure, and is
fitted (according to price) with various adjuncts,
even to a “ button-holing attachment.” Its price
ranges from about =£8 to <£18.
A tribute-party was working some par-
ticularly unlovely country in a Ballarat Fast
mine. The four o’clock shift was unanimously
K.G. (Cousin Jack), and a red-headed evangelist
had been stirring-up the Wesleyaus of the town
and district, and bringing them to a sense of their
unworthiness and a knowledge of the world to
come, consequently the Roley’s shift was suffering
a spasm of piety, and always prayed on the plat
before going in to the face, a circumstance, how-
ever, which did not debar them from the use of
any loose profanity that occasion seemed to
demand. It was almost necessary to keep her
timbered close up, and there was occasion
for a set when the afternoon-shift went on, but
the three felt fortified with righteousness, and
determined to let her go till after crib. They had
not been at work long when an ominous cracking
warned them off. “ Don’t ee be thinking, Brother
Veal, we’d best engage in prayer you?” The
three holy men adjourned unanimously to a safe
place, and Brother Veal indulged in prayer.
Whilst they were at their devotions a lump abcut
the size of an elephant came away from the hang-
ing-wall. Brother Veal stopped short in the midst
of his pious “rassle,” and, looking at his com-
panions, said impressively : “ If any man say
tome, after this, there he no ’fHeavy in prayer
you, I’m goin’ to tell him he’s a liar.” And
ho meant it.
To a woman who works for her living,
Says Berry, the knight,
A vote he would gladly be giving:
’Xvvere certainly right.
He would give her just one
For the work she has done—
He is very polite.
If a fortune she ended by making,
Ritolderolloo !
For a sou who his pleasure was taking
(As gentlemen do).
Should we give to that drone,
Having lands of his own,
A dozen, or two ?
His Honor is a barn6d man
Who sees the force of thrashing:,
And thinks his mighty engine can,
With one judicious lashing,
Regenerate a dreadful beast,
And make the lesson lasting.
Thus thinks the worthy judge—at least,
He thinks so when he’s fasting.
Rut after two helps off the roast,
And just enough of sherry.
Those sentiments give up the ghost-
His Honor’s feeling merry.
He reconsiders this, thinks that’s
Quite too rough on the sinner.
iVho says : “ There are no hungry cats
When man has had his dinner?”
The cat’s unfleshed ; now shall we budge.
And off the truth be casting,
Or make it lawless in a judge
To sentence when he’s fasting?
Full true’s the sentiment we sing—
Deny it if you can, sir—
A dinner is a noble thing
To put heart in a man, sir.

and certainly the importance and the necessity for
pure, suitable, and properly manipulated materials
cannot be overrated.
A ricketty and badly finished article of Furni-
ture may annoy, and an ill-designed sideboard or
cabinet offend pood taste ; but, even then, no
serious harm occurs. But with improperly purified
or badly made BEDDING, how different the tale,
for then you have that which is INJURIOUS
to HEALTH, and undoubtedly SPREADS
DISEASE.

manufacture the bedding they sell, but, buying
from wholesale makers, have to offer their cus-
tomers Made-up Goods, of the contents of which
they actually know nothing.
Let us consider for a moment that one-third of
one s life is spent in bed. Does it not concern you
to know that so great a part of life’s short span
ought to bo carefully and properly provided for?
Have you ever taken the trouble to examine
your mattress to find out what is in it ? Whether
HORSEHAIR or HOG HAIR,
WHITE JAVA KAPOK,
OR ONLY THAT
VERIEST OF RUBBISH,
THE OLD BLACK RAG FLOCK,
Or that short, seedy Indian Kapok called
Cotton Fly ?
Be wise, be wise. Do not let another day pass
until you have thoroughly examined your bedding.
Those Drapers, Ironmongers, Co-operative
Societies, and others who simply take orders for
bedding from the
PRICE LIST OF CHEAP MAKERS
are still worse off, having no knowledge whatever
of its manufacture, and are governed simply by
CHEAP PRICE LISTS,
and in many instances just place the order with
whatever wholesale maker offers them the greatest
discount.
Nor is this the only disadvantage their customers
suffer, as too frequently the bedding is supplied
by small makers, who have neither adequate
machinery to prepare the materials nor suitable
premises in which to carry on the work. Indeed,
if the purchasers of bedding could only see the
condition and surroundings of some of the makers
of bedding they would not allow the bedding to
come within coo-ee of their backyards, let alone
their bedrooms.
LAWLERS, of GOB George-street, Brickfield-
hill, have for many years manufactured all Bedding
upon their OWN PREMISES, importing the
materials DIRECT, employing the most improved
machinery, and having the work turned out under
their own supervision. We therefore can
GUARANTEE UNPRECEDENTED
VALUE
and Unrivalled Purity in whatever Bedding or
Upholstery leaves our steam factories. The enor-
mous increase in our Bedding and Wire Mattress
Department is perhaps the best proof that
LAWLER’S
efforts to supply only pure and wholesome and
healthy bedding at moderate and popular prices
have been thoroughly appreciated.
The Manufactories ADJOIN the Warehouse in
George street (608), and customers are invited to
see the machinery in motion and witness the pro-
cess of manufacture.

THE GREATHEŚ OF LITTLE THINGS
SMALL beginnings often lead to big results
A seemingly unimportant flaw in the founda-
tion of a building, if not discovered and promptly
attended to, may result in the loss of the whole
structure. A little bit of flirtation and a letter or
two full of ‘sweet nothings,” when ingeniously
focussed by a smart lawyer, will often constitute
the foundation on which to base an interesting
breach of promise case. A small but energetic
hen, turned loose in a flower garden, will, in the
course of one brief afternoon, reduce to a condition
of the most hopeless confusion all the artistic
taste resulting from weeks of patient toil on tin-
part of the enthusiastic horticulturist. A little
harmless-looki ng rusty tack in the carpet, with
the business end pointing sky wards, is a trifling
thing, but it plays an important part when taken
in conjunction witli the sole of a barefoot attached
to a man weighing 180 pounds or thereabouts
who has suddenly discovered its location. A
little pain or ttcho is often made light of at first
but by-and-bye, when it has develop! d into a
deep-seated disease, the folly of not regarding its
presence at an earlier stage becomes only too
apparent. A little forethought is a valuable
quality, and the man or woman possessed of it
will always be found forearmed and prepared to
grapple with any emergency, no matter how
unexpected. Hundreds and thousands of useful
lives that would otherwise have been blighted and
rendered not only valueless but physically un-
bearable, by the ravages of such dread complaints
as rheumatism, sciatica, and gout, or through the
improper treatment of those ordinary accidents
that may a ll y day befall, have been preserved and
lengthened by the timely employment of St.
Jacobs Oil, a medical combination of natural pro"
ducts, the specific virtues of which arc nothing
short of marvellous. No need to pay a visit to
the doctor (o have the sprained foot, the aching
back, the neuralgia tortured face, or the accidental
burn or bruise attended to when anyone can with
the aid of this wonderful embrocation successfully.
i 1 h uself in his own home l . The popularity
of fct. Jacobs Oil is evidenced by the enormous
sale it enjoys in every habitable part of the globe,
as well as by the general approbation of those who
have tested and proved its subtle healing proper-
ties, _ including the testimony of clergymen
physicians, judges, athletes, squatters, bushmen!
and toilers in every walk of life.
THE EASTER ENCAMPMENT.
Onr citizen soldiers are clearly determined not
to accept without a final struggle the decision of
the Government to deprive them of their annual
■ shivoo ” under canvas. Members have been
approached on the subject, and the political wires
are being pulled in the hope that a hard-hearted
Ministry may repent even to the elev< nth hour
and not mercilessly crush the fondest ambition of
Australia’s brave defenders. What a bitter dis-
appointment for the fair sex, too, will be this
latest phase of Governmental cheese-paring!
Fancy the anguish of Sophia at not being per-
mitted to see her noble George in full warpaint
on the tented field. The dear girls at any rate,
must be compensated for their share of the loss
in some way. A good plan would be for their
respective husbands, sweethearts, or brothers to
present each with one of our new Sterling Silver or
Rolled Gold \V aterbury Watches. The solatium
would be a pleasing as well as an eminently useful
one, while the cost to the donor need not cause
any anxiety. Ihese watches are little gems, are
beautifully finished, embrace all the very latest
improvements, and are retailed at prices ranging
from 40s. The new gentlemen's watches (series
“ K ”) are companion watches to the above, and
incomparable as accurate timekeepers.

ROLLER ELOUR,
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

Brisbane is favourite for the interprovincial

Rudolph, who in many people’s opinion could
have won Dreadnought’s Derby in ’B9, competed unsuc-
cessfully in a s.'lling race at Aspendale Park (Mel.)last
week. Bather a come-down for a Derby horse. Strange
that none of White’s cast-offs ever win anything for their
buyers, as witness Morok, Titan, Dreadnaught, Rudolph,
Prelude, &c. Another of White’s Derby animals, Volcano,
who started one of the hottest favourites on record for a
Caulfield Cup, and put up the Australian record for six
furlongs (1.14), has also been running unsuccessfully in
selling-races around Sydney. Both of these are geldings.

They say that Rarnage, who has been standing
down a good deal of late, will get a chance to win the
Sydney Cup on Greygown.
A real “ goud tiling ” did not couio off on
Hawkesbury Handicap day. Just before the second race
the “ books'” were betting on the Hawkesbury Handicap,
crying 5 to 4 (lie field, when a big punter rushed in and
took 50 to 40 about Plain Bill. The “ book” told hisclerk
to hook the wager 50 to 40 Tridentine for the Hawkesbury
Handicap, when the punter said he was backing Plain
Bill for the second race. “Bookie” cried the wager off,
but when wagering really commenced on the second race
the “ books ” had smelt a rat and opened 2to 1 on. Thus
do fools in the shape of big punters rush in where angels
in the shape of astute stables fear to tread.
* * *
The winner of the Rowley Mile carried a
penalty therefor for the first time in the history of the
Hawkesbury Handicap. This year’s conditions fdr the
race were so vaguely worded, that the owner of Triden-
tlne carried a penalty in preference to running the chance
of a disqualification.
• • »
To lecture such an artist as Mick Harris seems
“ a hit off,” but the writer, as a backer in a small way of
Tridentine, was anything hut pleased to see the animal,
running in mud fetlock-deep, with Ost. 51' >. in the saddle,
raced to the front, and the result was only as might have
been expected.

The Oxford -.Cambridge University boat-race
this year makes the 20th win for Oxford against Cam-

t ime' Unu. 21 sec., or 14 seconds faster than any previous
achievement, The Cambridge crew were beaten by 1J
leivMh«, the victory being against the start betting, a
condition! of prognostication v Inch is very rare indeed iri
connection with ’ Varsity matches. The year ’77 stands as
that of the only dead heat between the college crews, and
that happened because the Oxford “ bow ” caught a crab
and sprung his oar at the very finish, when the win
seemed assured.

The cable states that Johnel and Corbett have

Three Sydney bookmakers were recently travel-
ing in a railway carriage. Two were playing nap, the
third was looking on. One deal gave each exceptional
hands. The caller had the four chief hearts and the ace
of clubs; the dealer five small hearts. “I’ll go nap”
said the caller. “Twenty pounds you lose,” said the
onlooker. “ Done !” He led the ace of clubs. The on-
looker fairly kicked himself. By looking at both players’
hands and then laying the wager he had divined to the
expert the cards which the opponent held.

Mark the flashes on the distant
Strip of velvet green ;
Itainbow colours 'bine persistent
In the shimmering sheen—
Round the crimson banner muster
Heroes of the turf ;

On the silver surf.
Off they go ! Ye gods ! the ralt’.o
Of their hoofstrokes hum,
Like the roar of guns in battle
As they onward come.
In the van Althotas thunders,
Followed by Htlene ;
And old Bungey, working wonders,
Locked with Tridentine.
Marvel, Paris, Penance, Babel,

Each going “ lemons ” for their stable
As each good one ought.
Wild Rose racing with Stromboli
Swings out on the right,
And each sportsman mutters, “Holy

In the centre of the streaming
Colours Florrie flies,
And St. Blaize’s jacket beaming
In the rear-guard lies.
Hero, Gladstone, Spy Glass racing
Close against the rails ;
Winifred Ducrow outpacing
Onward calmly sails;
Touch and go with Lady Edda,
Jammed inside the ruck,
And for Vain Hope, who had led her
Like a flying buck.
Round the home turn, swiftly speeding,
Racing come the field,
Bungebah, by two lengths leading,
Not an inch will yield.
Shamrock with a brilliant rattle,
Worthy of his birth,
Fighting gamely through the batlle
Reaches Bungey’s girth ;
Like a flash of summer lightning
Trieste comes away,
And each jockey’s grasp is tightening
Round his w r hip to-day.
Magic Circle on the railing
Claims supremacy;
And Wild Rose, with wet sheet sailing,
Ne’er will beaten be.
Down the straight the fight is bitter,
Gamest of the game.
Through the gleam of satin glitter,
Emblem of her name ;
Passing Shamrock without toying,
Collaring Trieste,
Down the straight the mare comes flying—
Wild Rose of the West.
Roar and yell, with accents tragic,
Round the buffet bar ;
Wild Rose, first-Trieste, and Magio
Circle won’t be far.

Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

Josephus Riley.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The rum was rich and rare,
There were wagers in the air,
Ihe atmosphere was rosy, and the longues were
wagging free ;
But one was in the revel
Whose occiput was level—
-1 lam Josephus Riley, from the North Countree.
The conversation’s flow
Was not devoid of “blow,”
And^ mother was it wanting in the plain, colloquial
With a most ingenuous smile—
. “ This here is not my style,”
omd plain Josephus Riley, from the North
Countree.
*' And I wouldn’t be averse
T° emptying my purse,
And laying some small wager with the present
companee,
To cut the matter short—
Boot-racing is my forte,”
oaid plain Josephus Rilev, from the North
Countree.
“I think it’s on the cards
ctm That I can run three hundred yards
(ihe match to be decided where vou gentlemen
agree)
Against your fleetest horse ;
The race would prove a source
Of pleasure,” said Josephus, from the North
Countree.
“ To equalise the task,
. This little start I ask—
-Ihe rider, ere he follows, must imbibe a cup of
tea;
A simple breakfast-cup
, He will have to swallow up
lhats me —Josephus Riley, from the North
Countree.”
Then a “ knowing ’un” looked wise,
. “ Begged to apologise,
But might he ask what temp’rature the liquid was
to be !
Would it come from out the pot,
it Milkless, steaming, boiling-hot ? ”
Oh, no, not at all,” said Riley, from the North
Countree.
“ Allow me to explain;
. I do observe, with pain,
This jocular reflection on my native honestee,
My bump of truth is huge,
I’d scorn a subterfuge”—
Said plain Josephus Riley, from the North
Countree.
“ Before the parties start
I’ll take the Judge apart
To prove, by tasting, whether I have tampered
wuth the tea;
And I beg to state again
_ Your suspicions give me pain,”
plain Josephus Riley, from the North
Countree.
Then they all were satisfied
That the match was “ boneefied,”
The bond wassigned, and Riley went to “preparate”
the tea;
But his slow, ambiguous smile
Would have seemed to token guile,
In any man but Riley, from the North Countree.
He brought the fatal cup
By its saucer covered up—
The Judge examined its contents with awful
gravitee,
Then read the papers o’er,
But could not find a flaw :
“Wade in! Josephus Riley, from the North
Countree. ”
Then the “wagerer ” just bowed,
And passing through the crowd,
He handed up the beverage unto the “ wageree ”;
And off across the flat,
Springing gayly, pit-a-pat,
Went plain Josephus Riley, from the North
Countree.
But behind him what a yell
Of execration fell
From lips that lent themselves to shapes of great
profanitee !
For the people of that town
Were done a lovely brown
By plain Josephus Riley, from the North
Countree.
And hei’e’s the reason why :
The tea was simply dry,
You might cat it, but to drink it was impossi-
bilitee;
But, curious to state,
Men did not appreciate
This hum’rous innovation from the North
Countree.
You’ll understand, of course,
That wager was a source
Of very little profit to the hapless “ wageree,”
And, dating from that day,
I much regret to say,
Men look askance at Riley, from the North
Countree.
BARCROFT H. BOAKE.
They have a female garroter in Melbourne.
She is a large, ample lady with a grip like a
patent claw-trap, and with bulging biceps, and a
rough but taking way. She lurks in lanes and
dark places, and lies low for fat men. Tat men
are her speciality. She likes a man with an
extensive oleaginous formation and an enlarged
bust, because he is soft and yielding and short-
winded and easy to choke; and, besides, a fat
man usually goes ornamented with a portly, pedal-
motion gold chronometer, and a quantity of petty
cash, and has diamond studs scattered over his
front, and carries incriminating documents in Ins
pockets that he will ransom handsomely rather
than have them fall into the hands of his confiding
wife. When the lady garroter starts to hug a
stertorous and respectable citizen of half-a ton
burden, and fondle him, and wheedle him out of
the price of a new hat and etcetras, she invariably
has luck, and the cumbrous elector goes home
with his eyes disjointed, and looking purple and
disconnected, and is content to be reviled as a
disgusting inebriate, rather than venture upon
explanations that will involve him in graver
suspicions, and make his home-life a burden to
him.

THEY HAVE GREAT MERIT AND A LARGE SALE.
Their Merits may be briefly summarised as follows *,
They are the best of all blood purifiers.
They are the surest of all remedies for eruptions of the shin.
They are strongly recommended for eczema.
They clear the complexion, and gradually free it from pimply
and eruptive blemish.
They are pleasant to the taste.
They are liked by children.
They are a simple, safe and wholesome corrective for summer
ailments.
They are positively beneficial for children.
They are a gentle and efficacious medicine in the rational
treatment of constipation and haemorrhoids (piles).
They are a blood germicide, i.e., destructive of disease
germs or disease growths in the blood.
They are good for the liver, by reason of their tonic and
anti-septic influence on the hepatic blood vessels.
They render the blood aseptic or disease-resisting, and hence
ward off fevers, measles, diphtheria, small-pox, and
all infectious and epidemic complaints.
They have great merit in the palliative treatment of rheu-
matism, gout, etc.
They defend against chills, colds and congestions by reason
of their dispersal of all congestions, and if taken at
once will break up a dangerous chill by opening the
inner skin pores from within, and freeing them from
the contraction that imprisons poisonous and decom-
posing waste.

Medicine.
For children a medi-
cine should be abso-
lutely reliable. A
mother must be able to
pin her faith to it as to
her Bible. It must
contain nothing violent, uncertain,
or dangerous. It must be standard
in material and manufacture. It
must be plain and simple to admin-
ister; easy and pleasant to take.
The child must like it. It must be
prompt in action, giving immedi-
ate relief, as childrens’ troubles
come quick, grow fast, and end
fatally or otherwise in a very short
time. It must not only relieve quick
but bring them around quick, as
children chafe and fret and spoil
their constitutions, .under long con-
finement. It must do its work in
moderate doses. A large quantity
of medicine in a child is not desira-
ble. It must not interfere with the
child’s spirits, appetite or general
health. These things suit old as
well as young folks, and make Bo-
schee’s German Syrup the favorite
family medicine. ®

One account says that Williams’ defence
will be that his wives were addicted to singing
‘Little Annie Rooney” and “The Song that
Reached My Heart.”
From a late Melbourne decision it would
appear that when the hirer of time-payment furni-
ture falls into arrears the lender’s bailiffs cannot
legally break into the house and remove the goods,
even should there be a clause in the agreement
between hirer and borrower that such may be
done.
A lot may be forgiven Graham Berry,
because of his sensible treatment of the Victorian
aborigines while Chief Secretary. The superin-
tendent said they wouldn’t work. Berry declared
that they were only to work when they chose.
There were only 500 then—less now.
A sergeant of marines and a private
marine, the latter named Blatchford, slept in the
sfime room with others at Sydney; the sergeant,
according to his sworn evidence, saw Blatchford
fumbling about his bed in the night; in the morn-
ing, he missed a key, handkerchief, and shilling,
which were found on Blatchford, who, when
challenged, with apparent cheerfulness allowed
himself to be searched. Blatchford was then
charged With ,theft. Several officers of H.M.S.
Orlando.appeared iuCourtandgaveaccused,ayoung
man of 12 years service, a most excellent char
acter. Defendant, with much emotion, appealed
to Captain Fisher, the stipendiary magistrate, to
“ weigh carefully the facts of the case, and
endeavour to, see that he was a victim of circum-
stances.” The magistrate said there was a strong
doubt in the matter ; in consideration of Blatch-
ford’s good character, he would be discharged.
Of which decision the public will approve, because
unsupported circumstantial evidence is always to
be. distrusted, the square of distrust being in
inverse ratio to the apparent conclusiveness of the
circumstantial evidence.
The other day in a Sydney court the
customary Chinese witness was asked how he
would swear. He said cheerfully that lie would
swear anyway. He was asked next if he would
prefer to testify on a Bible or a lighted match, and
he answered effusively that either would do.
Then he was invited to express his views regarding
the subject of swearing upon a dead rooster, and
he said “ rooster welly good.” Somebody asked
him if he had any special views concerning the
Koran as an aid to conscience, and lie said it was
“ welly good, too.” The bench wanted to know
if he was a Buddhist and he responded “yes.”
Then another individual said that he believed the
witness, was a Christian, and being questioned he
said “yes” to this also. Finally a Bible and a
lighted match were both offered to him. Where-
upon he blew upon the Bible and tried to kiss the
match.' At this point the court asked him despair-
ingly where he would go to if he told what wasn’t
true and he said affably, “ alleeli.” Being furthei
asked inhere he would go to, ho answered “Yes.’
Then his evidence was taken, it being considered
that he was about as good a witness as tin
average. Probably lie was.

A Much-Misunderstood Millionaire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
A tall man, solitary in his ways, always
dressed in grey tweed and invariably wearing a
soft felt hat. A healthy, ruddy complexion, iron-
grey beard and moustache, with extremely bright
blue eyes. These last are a noticeable feature and
compel your attention from their peculiar clear-
ness. When you pass this, individual, who is
almost certain to be alone, for. millionaires are a
lonely race, you have passed the richest man in
Australia, James Tyson, who has just come into
special prominence by the substantial financial
help he has accorded the 'Queensland.Government.
* # ;■
Ninety-nine out of every hundred people
pass “ Jimmy ” Tyson without noticing him, for
although everybody has heard of him, personally
he is little known. His dress does ’not betray
him, either by its loudly-proclaimed magnificence
or by any assumption of careless neglect. One
hears it often said that the mammoth millionaire
habitually clothes himself in slops or moleskin
and munches a roll and a polony for his lunch.
Nothing of the sort. His clothes are tailor-made
and well-fitting, though very sober in colour,' his
only singularity may be said to be his affection
for a soft felt hat as head-gear. He has liis club
and lunches there like other men.
* # #- -
Tyson belongs to a generation now giving
place to somewhat effete successors. He is one of
the early race of “ natives,” who first caused it to
be generally supposed that all Australians are
tall, gaunt, sun-burnt, and taciturn—-a race who
did good work in their day, and many of whom
are deservedly enjoying the fruits iff their early
struggles with the vyilderness. 1 1 'is true that
many who also struggled hard and honestly are
now m the Benevolent Asylums. s
James Tyson and his brothers vyfre born at
Menangle in N.S. Wales, and totfk an active
share in the pioneer settlement «©f Australia,
is the family failing; ‘One brother,
tmter, kept himself for years an outwardly poor
man, through his eagerness in buying up land with
every shilling he could muster; t)f the subject of
bnr sketch more yarns, fabulous arid otherwise,
have been told than of any other private indivi-
uual m Australia. Most of them areehestnuts
apphed indiscriminately to any rich man suspected
°i nearness,” and others are palpable lies.
Hen, is a fair specimen of the average Tyson

Now, as a matter of fact,-no such arrangement
‘. ''barging separately for meals ever existed on
l a mers running between Sydney and Queens-
We have no wish to pourtray king-monopolist
Tyson in the light of a saint, ready for a halo and
enshrinement in a stained-glass window; but so
many of the stories concerning him are greatly
misleading as to his true character, that a few
veritable facts about the chief millionaire of Aus-
tralia may prove entertaining. James Tyson loves
the bush, is essentially a bushman, and is always
more conversational on subjects relating to country
affairs. The only time the writer of this article
ever had a lengthy talk with him was in Brisbane,
just after returning from a prolonged trip out
West. The conversation turned upon hardship
and short commons in new country, and Tyson
grew quitd eloquent on the various animals and
vermin that could be used to support life after the
ordinary rations had failed. He expressed a
decided disapproval of ’possums; bandicoot was
what he swore by.
Tyson’s objection to being imposed upon, and
his unostentatious ways have gained him an un-
deserved reputation for stinginess, but too many
well-known instances of his generosity and grati-
tude' (which -latter examples almost invariably
take the form of liberal aid to men in difficulties
whom he knows to be resolute and honest) are
extant for this to be the case. But he is obstin-
ately determined not to be “had as a certain
church dighitary in Queensland found to his cost.
The gentleman in question was pushing a charity
forward; and .Tyson sent him.a cheque for ,£250.
The reverend*"sent back a polite note thanking
him fpr the donation, but intimating that he had
hoped for a larger sum from a man of Mr. Tyson’s
known wealth. Tyson, in reply, asked for the
cheque back. It was readily sent, the clergy-
man smilingly expecting a larger one. It never
came. Tyson was disgusted at such barefaced
begging; and now that parson never omits an
opportunity of assuring his hearers that a rich
man cannot get into heaven.
It is related of him that he always travels by
steamer under an assumed name, after the manner
of Jonah Perkins, in order to avoid any possible
application for a loan ; but it is not the case, any
more than the hackneyed story that when travel-
ing in the bush lie carries a few cobs of corn in his
saddle-pouch, and camps out and boils them in his
quart-pot in preference to putting up at a station
or a roadside inn.
Tyson’s peculiar habits, unconventional, solitary
and sparing of speech as he is—by the way, he in-
variably calls everybody “ Mister,” no matter how
long he has known him—have been the cause of
much of this misconception. He is supposed to
be a woman-hater, but people who lived out on the
Warrego during the early days tell a different
story, and though our multi-millionaire has never
been guilty of the weakness of matrimony and
absolutely shudders at the restraints of fashionable
society he will,.tell you, if he knows you well
enough, that he yields to no one in his admiration
(from a respectable distance, certainly) of the cul-
tured and healthy and cheerful woman who is, or
is fitted to become, a prudent, helpful and virtuous
housewife. It must be said, in extenuation of,
James Tyson’s bachelorhood, that he is the'only
one of his family against whom there is anything
like the shadow of a prima-facie charge of
misogyny. No jury would convict his brother
Peter op such an accusation. . Nor his now illus-
trious nephew James.
Coming down in the steamer from Brisbane to
Sydney, B , a well-known and genial Queens-
land squatter, shared the cabin with Tyson. As a
rule, the confined space of a cabin necessitates one
man dressing at a time.
. B— 7- was dressing, and Tyson lying, medita-
ting, in his bunk.
“-B ,” he said, at last, “ you are not half the
man you were. You are getting like my nephew,
J-—j too fat; you eat too much, and drink too
much. Why don’t you live naturally ?”
“Do you believe in living naturally ?” said B .
“ Certainly I do.’’
“ Then get married as soon as you can,” replied
B ,as he left the cabin. Tyson’s reflections on
the subject have not been recorded.
The same man, who was a neighbour of Tyson’s,
relates that, being in want of a sheep-drover, an
individual, whom we may call Blanks, applied for
the billet, and mentioned Tyson as a former em-
ployer. On being applied to, the masterful James
gave the following reference : —“ Blanks ! yes.
He took some sheep down for me, and did very
well with them. I was giving him thirty shillings
a week. I raised him to two pounds and gave
him another lot. He did all right, but not quite
so well as the first time, and I noticed that he
commenced to wear a collar. However, he got
another lot, and a rise of ten shillings. This time
he did not do so well as before, and he had started
a necktie with a pin in it. Well, Mister, to make
a long story short, he got another job and another
rise, and then I saw him buckling on a pair of
long-hooked spurs, and he had about four pouches
on his belt, but he didn’t do anything like so well.
No, Mister.’ Blanks is a first-class drover at thirty
shillings a week, but at two or three pounds he’s
no good. Success spoils him.”
In the sixties, when a race meeting was being
held in Hay, Tyson passed the place. He camped
out, and his horses wandered away. Next morn-
ing B met him with his saddle and swag, on
his shoulder, going down: the main street. “Why
don’t you stop and wait for your horses?” he
asked. “No,” returned the stubborn James, “I
never turnback.” He walked on eighteen miles
before the black boy overtook him with the lost
horses
An instance of alleged nearness has often been
told regarding one of his western stations,
whereon, it is asserted, he refused to allow any
milkers to be broken in, on the ground that every
pound of butter made and every quart of milk
drunk robbed the calves of flesh.' The truth and
origin of the yarn being that, visiting the place
during a severe drought, he found a number of
poor milkers and half-starved,.calves kept in at a
time when the paddocks were destitute of grass,
and naturally ordered them to be turned out.
All the money he has made in pastoral matters
has been acquired through good judgment and
shrewd management. Long ago, when fat cattle
brought a decent price in Melbourne, he had
secured good fattening paddocks in one of the
best districts of Victoria, and regularly over-
landed his store bullocks and had some always
ready to secure top prices in the Melbourne
market.
His method, and love of care, pursue him
through all the avocations of his life, as witness
hjs.careful remembrance of the fact that he owed
the barmaid of a leading Sydney hotel ninepence.
After an absence of nearly twelve months, he
duly called in to pay it. Not to be beaten, the
girl handed him a pair of socks which she asserted
he had left behind after his visit, and which she
had had washed and darned.' Naturally Tyson
took them with unmoved gravity or he would not
have, been Tyson.
One day when returning home on one of his
Queensland stations he overtook a couple of swag-
men, who asked him the distance, to the home-
stead, which he told' them. “It belongs to that
hungry , Tyson, doesn’t it ?” said one. “ Any
chance of a feed there?” “You’ll get a night’s
shelter,” said Tyson, riding on, when one caljbd
out, “ Got any matches or tobacco on youi:?”
Tyson had both, although he does not smoke fall
the same, it is his delight to cut up tobacco,|jat
which he sniffs lovingly, as if he did indulge in the
weed). He gave the men a fig of tobacco and
some matches. At sundown the swagmen turrjed
up and the storekeeper gave them the usual
rations. Just as he had finished Tyson came;ln
to the store and remarked, “ These men owe me
6d.-—6d. for tobacco, and 2d. for matches.” h
“ Who the carnation are you ?”
“I’m that hungry , Tyson,” he replied.
“ If you had been civil you might have had tjjie
tobacco and welcome, but now you can pay for
it.” And they did. lj
Tyson’s first step towards fortune was made, he
relates, far back in the Fifties. He was taking
stock over to Victoria and found himself stuck bp
by flood and bog. Near him a sheep-drover was
camped under similarly wretched circumstances,
and after soine talk Tyson bought up his sheepijat
Gs. per head. The purchase completed, he set
about findingmeansof transitaoross the flooded river
and obtaining a suitable-boat succeeded in crossing
both his own cattle and the sheep without lobs.
He made for Bendigo, then ip its glory, where'he
sold the sheep (16,000) at 265. per head.- and the
cattle at GOs.-pcr cwt. Since then, by judicidiis
investments, and a ready grasp of every situation
where there was an opportunity for a good bar-
gain, ho has made the colossal fortune with which
he is generally credited. His capital is variously
estimated at anything between four and ten
millions, and it is stated on good authority thipt
one year’s operations in Queensland and New
South Wales netted him at least £425.000. This
is a tidy income, and it is not to be wondered (it
that bis fame lias travelled beyond Australian
shores, and-that he was once made the .subject bf
an article in a London paper, wherein a lady
trotted him out as a matrimonial prize worth
trying for.
With the family eye on land, Tyson has bp|h
interested in syndicates for land-grant railways in
Queensland on several occasions, but, as the pro-
jected lines have never come off, his estate is still
lacking the ample dimensions he would seem to
desire. What will become of his wealth is a
question. He has no relative who has any great
claim on him, and he is a hale, hardy man of 60,
with every faculty unimpaired, and as keenly bent
on making money as ever, so that no one can
estimate what his fortune may be when his time
comes at last.
He has been heard to lament on several occasions
that his tastes did not lie in some direction outside
of stock and finance. Even horse-racing would
be.welcome if he could only bring himself to take
a thorough interest in it. " But the bent of ms
disposition does not tend that way and he has Jto
content himself with turning over a few paltry
hundreds of thousands every year. A millionaire
who does not drink, does not smoke, is imperviopa
to the most fascinating wiles of fascinating womeip;
and yet is not a sordid miser of tW Daniel Dander
type, is something unique, and Australia may tike
credit for having produced the fivlt .specimen'df
the kind. He has not .even bailtliimfelf a “lordfy

new theatre!” “A lunatic asylum!” until at
last he is told that it is a simple dwelling-house,
and is struck speechless. Tyson is too much of a
genuine bushman to feel any pleasure in such
empty magnificence. Ho dislikes society. Go-
vernment House has never had any attractions for
him. Even the “genial” Carington could not
get the reserved and silent Jimmy to put his legs
underneath his mahogany, although he tried per-
sonal persuasion and Lady C. wrote an invitation
in her own fair hand.
As already remarked, Tyson is one of the old
race of natives who grew up to self-reliance and
hard work. Their paths were not made easy for
them by a rum-selling progenitor, or a successful
land-booming parent, but they learnt their bush-
craft from Mother Nature, and have been her
children ever since. To this may be ascribed the
fact that in spite of Tyson’s business shrewdness
and natural disposition towards making money,
he retains his love of simplicity, of fresh, breezy
nature, and the acquirement of knowledge of ail
sorts. An indefatigable reader, he has probed
problems with which no outsider would ever
suspect him of meddling.
Once, during his early days, he was driving a
horse-dray, and at the foot of a hill the horses,
which were pretty well done, stuck him up. A
teamster was passing, and from him Tyson asked
the usual favour of a pull up the pinch. The
driver, seeing he was in a fix, asked a price which
Tyson justly considered extortionate, so he
declined to give it. He unloaded the dray single-
handed, and by dint of hard work and cunning
zigzagging, got it to the top of the hill; then he
got the load up piece-by-piece, and finally led the
knocked-up horses up and proceeded triumphantly
down the other side, having successfully resisted
an attempt at imposition.
One evening a well-known bush-missionary (self
dubbed) came to one of Tyson’s stations when he
happened to be at home. The individual sent in
hi* name and was received with the usual bush
hospitality. He improved the occasion after
di iner and extracted from Tyson a half-promise
th »t he would contribute towards his little mission.
Unfortunately there was some rum on the place,
and, at the invitation of the manager, the “ser-
vant of the Lord ” took two or three second-
mates’ nips that put him to sleep in one of the
verandah-chairs. Next morning he reminded
Tyson of his application for a subscription, but
that individual grimly remarked that as it was a
dry country, the kindest thing he could do was to
give the shepherd the perpetual free run of the
tank —the water-tank, not the rum-keg.
We can scarcely say that it would be well for
the country if there were many Tysons in it, but
there is no doubt that the same sagacity and
earnestness, the same splendid generalship and
iron determination which have served him so well
at money-making, would have brought him to the
front rank in many other pursuits. His good deeds
are little known, for he does not advertise them.
Now and again one hears of them by accident, but
everybody is ready to repeat some alleged anec-
dote of his dog-mean closefistedness.
A Strange Symposium,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bourke-streefc is very busy to-day. Up
and down it flows a living river—strangest of
rivers-with two currents which run in opposite
directions at the same time. Looking up at the
Post-office Clock, with its face in half-mourning
for lost time, I find that the hour is 11 a.m.
I have an appointment to meet a man at a certain
place in five minutes. In five minutes I am there.
This is the nearest hint I can afford to give as to
the position of the hotel wherein I first met the
many curious characters who form the Symposium
I am about to attempt to describe.
A shady, spacious room, with a suggestion of
green coolness in the atmosphere. The suggestion
comes from long-fronded ferns and large-leaved
geraniums that grow in tubs, also painted green,
outside a window which looks into the back-yard.
Coming out of the glitter of the garish street into
this dim chamber behind the bar, one has to
pause a moment before being able to make out
what it contains. But as the eyes grow accus-
tomed to the half-light the following objects
become visible : two tables, two sofas, two spit-
toons, a number of chairs, and a mirror in a fly-
speckled frame hanging at an inebriate angle over
the mantelpiece. Each sofa supports a semi-
recumbent form, and most of the chairs are occu-
pied. There are long glasses on the tables, some
of them entirely empty, and some with a resi-
duum of viscous froth at the bottom. Beer is
evidently the favourite beverage in this boudoir
of Bacchus —and beer in long glasses, too. There
is not a small, or even medium-sized, tumbler on
the table. An ominous sign, this.
# * #
Why an ominous sign ? Because when a
man has come to the stage in his carousing career
when he wants the largest quantity of liquor that
can be got for the smallest silver coin in currency,
his palate is ruined, he no longer knows the fine
luxury of rolling a rare brand on his tongue, with
his head thrown slightly backward and his eyes
cast thankfully in the direction of the ceiling.
There is as much difference between him and the
man whose delicate senses are touched to
tremulous delight by the flavour and aroma of
noble vintages as between the bee that sips honey
from the cup of the flower, and the ox that
devours it in one bite, petals, pistils, leaves, stalk
and all. He is, in fact, nothing more than a
human hogshead whose sole ambition is to be full,
and always full.
* * *
The person who made the appointment
with me has left word with the siren behind the
bar that he was called away on important busi-
ness, but will be back in the course of an hour. I
am going to sit down and wait for him, and, in
the meantime, make what observations I can, in
a quiet way, of what goes on around me.
# * *
To begin with, I notice that most of the
regular members of the Symposium are present.
By regular members I mean those who make
their appearance in this room day after day and
spend much time there. They are as lavish in
this sort of expenditure as though they were
clockmakers. The Symposiarch is in his usual
seat with his back to the mirror in the fly-speckled
frame. His usual oxybaphon of “colonial” ale
stands on the table, within convenient reach of his
hand. I call him the Symposiarch because he is
perpetual president of this informal club—the
first to come and the last to go, and never—unless
on a fishing expedition or laid up with the gout—
a day out in his attendance. I have a fancy that
he is included in the lease of the premises. Hour
after hour in the early part of the day he sits
silent in his chair, absorbed and absorbing, his
head in a cloud of smoke and his feet on each
side of a spittoon. But, later on, after he has
emptied many oxybaphons, he awakes from his
lethargy—and becomes amusing. His humour is
of the dry order—in fact, I may say that I have
not met with none drier. It needs a vast amount
of moisture before it blossoms. Even then it is
too Rabelaisian to bo quotable in a refined and
modest age like the present. Some of his “good
stories” if printed in a paper would increase its
circulation by thousands in one week, and pro-
bably send its proprietor to gaol the week after.
# # #
mi • .
The most taciturn man in the room is the
individual who is sitting in the darkest corner,
wide ; eyed and wakeful, but speechless and move-
less, like a red-nosed image of the god Harpo-
crates. And yet this man could if he chose tell a
more thrilling story of strange experiences he has
had, ranging from piracy in the Aru Archipelago
down to newspaper-editing in the Ear North, than
any of the wild and weird school of romance-
writers now in vogue has yet given to the world,
I know this because he told me the story one day
when we happened, by curious chance, to be the
only persons in the room. It is a pity that he is
not a romance-writer himself. But possibly he is.
He may have been trying on me the effect of a
few chapters from his forthcoming work, like the
man in one of Aldrich’s sketches who told to a
sympathising stranger a terrible yarn about being
shut up in a family vault for an hour, and coming
out with his hair as white as snow at the end of
the time, and, when he had worked up the feelings
of the stranger to a satisfactory pitch of horror,
confessed that the yarn had no foundation, in fact,
but was simply his next contribution to the
magazine for which he was writing. I would be
sorry to think that my friend in the corner was
guilty of such baseness, but I would not be greatly
surprised as I distrust all silent men. If a man is
not talking he must be plotting, and plotting no
good, you may be sure. The Governments of the
world are not inimical to secret societies for
nothing.
* # *
Yet, for all the conversation that is carried
on this room the party gathered in it might as
well be a Symposium in the Catacombs. Apathy
sits like a succubus on the chests of all of them,
and the air is dense and deadening with invisible
husks of physical and mental decay. One begins,
after sitting here for a while, to lose grasp of
existence and to wonder in a vagne, vegetable wav
how much longer the world will have to wait for
the Resurrection. And all this time, a few yards
off, the river of life runs full and fast in the sunlit
street outside. But this is a stagnant backwater
in which you will find only battered hulks and
rotting derelicts. Brave and goodly vessels in
their time, too, many of them, taut and trim and
well-provided for their destined vovages—and
now ! What has brought them to this sad condi-
tion ? God knows—and the brewers. Woman
also, no doubt, in some cases.
: ’ #
Over there on the sofa under the window
lies, perhaps, the saddest wreck of all. A man of
not more than 40 years of age but who looks as
though he were 60. Many years ago he made
some reputation by writing a few things which
were considered full of fine promise. He even
published a book, and the critics in reviewing it
said that the true Elizabethan drama had arisen
from its grave at Stratford-on-Avon, and taken
shape, and colour, and life again, under the
Southern Cross. This, with the flattery of his
friends, was more than the head of the poor author
could stand. It was a case of tete montee with
him from that time forth. He despised the every-
day drudgery of the press and, as there was not a
steady demand for tragedies—by the way, the
first and only edition of the one for which he had
obtained so much praise, was subsequently sold
by weight—he went steadily to the dogs and the
devil. Yet this is not altogether true. He made
many gallant struggles ere he—though hardly
with their excuse of genius, if genius be an excuse
a matter which I am very much inclined to
doubt—
r
The late W. B. Dailey used to tell a
story of the last time he saw Deniehy, who was
then living, or dreaming that he was living, in
Bathurst. He found the brilliant but erratic
essayist in an obscure back-parlour of an obscure
hotel, sitting upright on a chair and gazing
intently into vacancy. He spoke to him, but
could only get a nod of recognition in reply,
“ Can I do anything for you, Dan ? ” said Dailey.
“ Call for some brandy,” said Deniehy.
“Bring in two glasses of brandy,” remarked the
late Privy Councillor, turning to somebody belong,
ing to the hotel who was standing close by.
“ Stop ! ” exclaimed Deniehy, holding his thin,
long hand up, “ Two glasses! Bring in a bottle!”
The bottle was brought in and he poured him-
self out half a tumblerful, which he drank off raw
at one gulp. Then he poured out a similar
quantity again, and drank it off also. “And
then,” Mr. Dailey used to say, “ he talked for an
hour on end with the tongues of men and angels,
And then he suddenly collapsed, and I couldn’t
get another w r ord out of him.”

of course, with the man on the sofa. After he
has taken a certain number of drinks, not too
P an 7 but just enough to produce a transient blaze
in his smouldering brain, he grows eloquent over
m &ny things, but chiefly over what splendid poems
and stories he is going to write when I can give

neither is he dead. He is merely waiting for
somebody to ask him to take a drink, and, every
now and then, casts a wistful glance m the direc-
tion of the door. But no succour comes from that
quarter, and he closes his eyes again with a look
aa mtly resignation, and goes on waiting. He
is the most patient man I ever saw. The others
call him the Vampire—why, I know not, unless it
is in reference to his ghastly colour. But he is
distinct from them in one respect, at least. He is
Plunged deep down in the depths abysmal,
The gulf, and grave, of Maginn, and Burns,
And pawned his soul for the devil’s dismal

That’s little Spavinson, the veterinary surgeon,
addressing the barmaid. He is a great Eliza-

favourite authors. They say, indeed, that he
soothes the horses that are brought to him for

He is a pretty picture. His clothes are covered
with a thousand beer-stains, stain upon stain —a
palimpsest of stains—so that by analysing them
you could tell what he has had to drink every day
year past, as Flaubert says you could divine
the mnners that Madame Bovary had cooked for
a Whole twelvemonth previously by the grease-
spots on her gown. Even the Remains of the
Tragic Poet became spasmodically alive, because
Spavinson is a man who always has money and is
always ready to spend it in the Symposium. He
is, in fact, a leading member of it himself, and
certainly the most solvent of the crowd.

them—it is the man with the beer-stains who is
talking:—“l retnember one day the Governor
telling Tom —his body-servant, you know—to ask
the head-keeper—the Governor had six keepers—
if there was a box in the Hoggleyhole Cover,
because Lord Chumley Cheroot —you’ve heard of
him, "Of course, fine sportsman and great friend of
the Governor’s —and the Marquis of Mngford—

know, kept a pack of hounds, and used to hunt

■ “ Were they the Pytchley or the Quorn?” sar-

his fingers. He is wild to get a chance to “ chip
in with reminiscences of the magnificent style in
which he himself was brought up.
But here is my friend, punctual to his appoint*
ment. One word, however, before I finish. Let
no reader of this slight sketch conclude that the

the contrary, there are none more generous when
they have the money. And that is precisely the
cause of all the trouble and the raison d'etre of
the Strange Symposium.
OBEEVE KOE.
Dear Bulletin, —The following veracious
yarn will illustrate the danger of neglecting the
early education of children : —About the year ’B5
there lived on the tipper Ooomera a married
couple known to the settlers by the name of
Hooley. One season the flat on which they lived
became infested with bandicoots ; the little pests
tore up Hooley’s garden stuff, and, to use his own
words, “played the very devil wid him.” In an
evil hour a friend advised Hooley to get a gun and
shoot some of his enemies. He did. He got a
gun—a discarded regulation musket —with powder
and shot to match. Hooley didn’t know much
about guns, so onedayhe essayed to “practish”
with his musket. Having loaded up carefully, he
set his back hard against a fence, pointed the
musket at a gum-tree, and pulled the trigger.
Bang she went, with a roar like a nine-pounder,
but not a scratch on the tree, “Not enough
powdher,” remarked Hooley, “I’ll thry a little;
more,” and he emptied about half a teacupful of
diamond-grain down the neck of his artillery.
Bang again. Hooley staggered, recovered him-
self, and his eye again sought “ruin and devasta-
tion ” on the bark of the tree. Again not a scratch.
“ Gimme the powdher again, Biddy!” he yelled,
and he seized the flask and dosed the much-
enduring musket again; Heaven knows what
quantity he put in. There was a terrific report
and a yell as the musket kicked Hooley on the
jaw, and knocked - him over the fence, and
climbed over after, him. and kicked him on
the other jaw, and then jumped on him, and hit
him below the belt; then seeking more worlds to
conquer it tore up three rods of split fence, and
chased Biddy 11 times around the milking yard,
after which it swam the river and rushed into the
office of an electioneering J.P. and broke up 15
dead marines, upset the nail-can and gin-case
comprising the office furniture, tore the big X
comprising the J.P.’s official signature off some
important documents and swallowed the docu-
ments in question, and finally burst, filling the air
with gun, and devastated J.P., and other ruins.
Hooley is buried on the bank of the river. His
»ad end is a solemn warning to parents and
guardians. If in his neglected youth he had been
taught to shoot landlords he would have known
how to load a gun properly, and would not have
expended himself m a futile attempt to shoot a
g mntree without putting son e shot in his gun
along witli the powder. —Yours,
&c., G. B.
A Large Machinery Warehouse
From a “needle to an anchor is a trite .expres-
sion which is seldom to be found more Completely
exemplified than in an inspection of, the machinery
and hardware warehouses of Messrs. H. G.
Watkins & Co., North Kent-stree't, Sydney.
This firm’s extensive stores are situated opposite
the Flagstaff, and occupy a prominent position as
seen from the harbour. Notwithstanding thftt
Sydney .has its immense importing warehouses,
and is justly, noted for the enterprise of its mer-
chants, yet the buyer generally finds it impossible
to obtain all his requirements under one roof. It
has, however, apparently been the desire of
Messrs. R. G. Watkins & Co. to obviate this
difficulty, and recompense their visitorsfordrawing
them up that end of the town, past the allurements
of the Grosvenor Hotel, into their warehouse,
where it was our privilege to see a display which
is certainly unequalled in the Australian’colonies,!
and we doubt even if'suehra varied assortment can
be found concentrated in the old country. In a
building extending some 200 ft. along Rent-street
there has been laid down a solid floor, and in the
first division is exhibited a display of hew
machinery, most of.-which is by the'rehowned'fitm
of Eliza Tinsley—also Isaac Storey and Sons’
engine-fittings, Evans and Sons’ . steam'-pUmp'a,
and a variety of general wood-working tools,--gas
and steam engines, &c. Thii department CQtn-
prises every requirement for the mining manager,
engineer, contractor, or sawmill proprietor,
while the value represented cannot be . less,
than £20,000. In course of conversation Mr. 4
Watkins explains that his business'’' supplies
the principal railway contractors of this colony,|
and that he takes an active interest
these contracts, but not in a way That.such fa (
statement might he accepted unless explained,
he does, by saying that he keeps; himself - keenly,
alive to their wants, imports the. best and
tools and labour-saving implements,*ahdihqldtjhpi
opinion that no firm can properly/ cater.|or^con-,
tractor’s requirements and at the same.tbue com-,
pete with them by tendering for
works. The support accorded to the
to bear out this theory, and no
kins’s experience in this trade
for the high position he occupiesin the estimation
of contractors. . .
On passing into the second division of the
establishment we found it stocked con-
ceivable description of heavy plant and machinery
—iron, steel, tubes, oils, &c., and powerful cranes
are utilised to transport the various heavy pack-
ages to and fro the whole range of the store. - An-
item of interest struck us in the original Beam
Engine which did duty for the S.M.}HEKAm)_many
years since, still looking as fresh as the day it was
turned out of its maker’s hands. Alongside ythis
in chronological order we were invited to inspect
the 16 h.p. Otto Gas Engine which supplanted the
Beam Engine and supplied the motive power for
the same journal until a few month's since when
another type of engine was put in to replace it.
Surrounding these in a covered space of about two
acres there are ranged portable and other engines
of every size and type —boilers, batteries, winding-
gears, amalgamators and pumps of all kinds
and capacities from 500 to 60,000 gallons
per hour. Mr. Watkins modestly . ven-
tured to say that he advertises having the most
complete stock in Australia, and at this stage we
are not prepared to combat that statement, but we
are agreeable to compliment him on his pluck and
enterprise in providing such a stock. No doubt,
as we have indicated, there is a difficulty in find-
ing firms who cater for all mechanical require-
ments, but it would be almost impossible to call
for an item which would not be immediately
forthcoming in this warehouse. There will shortly
be very proper legislation for the supervision of
land boilers, and Mr. Watkins expresses his con-
viction that it would do away with the pernicious
sale of death-traps in the shape of second-hand
boilers, and he always declines to sell, other than
new steel boilers tested to 150 or 200 pounds
per square inch, of which he stocks,a large
number. Visitors from the country,’ especially
those of a mechanical turn of mind, when tired of
the National Gallery, Museum, and “Our Har-
bour,” could profitably spend a few hours of
interest and enjoyment at Messrs. R. G. Watkins
& Co.’s Warehouse, and we feel sure that those
who do will be courteously received, and will
agree with us that the firm has supplied “a long-
felt want. ” . .
The important point of news copyright is
to come before the London courts in a week or
two, over the case of the Times v Hansard.
Hansard slashes out whole speeches from the
Times, and there being a change in the Hansard
proprietary, the Times seizes the occasion to ,try
the point; We have shown how cable news ,is
copyright in Australia, or in Australian cities,
but how long it extends is the question.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
More than five-and-twenty years ago, on a newly-
formed station on a north-western Queensland
river, a young fellow, named Hewett, was left in
charge, in consequence of the managing partner
having been hastily called down to Sydney. It was
a cattle station on wide-spreading plains, backed
up by patches of scrubby forest. You could ride for
miles and miles without seeing an elevation of
any sort, or anything livelier than a soaring
kite. Naturally, time hung rather heavily on the
hands of Hewett and his men, and, consequently,
the loose morality of the time and district was
adopted, and although the blacks were not “let
in,” as it is termed, several native women were
camped at the station. However, that was thought
no more of then than it is at present in some
parts of Western Australia.
As things turned out it was nearly three years
before Hewett was relieved from duty. Then the
station passed into the hands of the bank, and one
of their own men came up and took charge.
Amongst the half-caste children about the place
was one bright little fellow who was a great pet
with them all, especially his father, Hewett. He
had a strange white tuft of hair on his head,
which the men used to call “ Pompey’s brand ; ”
he having been named Pompey. Hewett left and
Pompey continued to grow up on the station.
Twelve or thirteen years passed, and by one of
those common freaks of fortune, Hewett returned
to take permanent charge of the same station in
the interests of a different owner, it having
change hands once more.
Naturally, everything was somewhat altered.
The cattle had increased, the improvements were
better, and everything more civilised. One thing,
however, was unchanged—the old racial feud with
the blacks continued, and a native-police barracks
was established on the river. Hewett’s successor,
it seems, had tried the experiment of allowing the
blacks to come in and camp on the river without
interference, and although it gave the men some
trouble with the cattle for a time, it answered
well, apparently.
However, the usual outbreak at length took
place. The natives very soon took to killing cattle
again. Then they were hunted out once more,
and with them went all the quiet gins £nd
piccaninies who had been camped at the station.
When Hewett again took charge he found he had
plenty to do to keep the natives out of the herd.
Just before he came back, one of the old hands,
of his former time, had been re-engaged, an old
fellow known as Ben. Walker.
At last, going out on the run one day to look at
a camp of fat cattle that were shortly intended
for market, they were encountered by a panting
lot of bullocks with hanging tongues and heaving
sides. Little need to guess what had happened ;
the blacks had been amongst them and the cattle
would be fit for nothing for months. Sending the
others to collect and steady what they could find,
Hewett and old Ben rode on to the police-camp.
The officer in charge was at home, and with a
couple of native troopers they were soon on their
way to the camp. The fresh tracks were picked
up and the pursuit commenced. It was pretty
easy tracking, and by dusk they had settled the
site of the natives’ camp, and arranged to “ dis-
perse ” it at daylight.
Day broke and the camp was surrounded before
the blacks, who are always late sleepers, had time
to fly. Hewett was after a couple who were
dodging; him in the scrub. Suddenly one, who
was quite a youngster, and had a spear in his
hand that he had picked up in his flight, turned
and faced him, out of breath. Hewett raised his
revolver and took aim, when the glint of the early
morning sun fell straight on the nigger. It acted
like a flash of memory. He saw by the yellowish-
brown nude figure that the boy was a half-caste,
and recognised by the white forelock, “ Pompey’s
brand,” that it was his own son he was going to
kill. The young fellow saw him hesitate, took
courage, and sent the spear straight through
Hewett’s body. The clutching finger pulled the
trigger, and Pompey went to the happy hunting-
ground with his father’s bullet in his brain.
The officer and Ben Walker rode up soon after-
wards, dismounted hastily and examined Hewett,
but he was on the point of death. They did all
they could to ease him, and then Ben went to look
at the nigger. “By God !” he said, as he looked
at the white tuft, now partly blood-stained, “ if
it isn’t Pompey!’’
“Who’s Pompey ?” asked the officer who was
just behind him,
“ His son,” said Ben shortly, pointing at the
dead body of the white man.
A certain shoemaker in Melbourne
seriously thinks of indicting a well-to-do family
for getting boots mended under false pretences.
He had fallen in love with one Mary Jane, a
domestic servant, and he used to mend that fair
enslaver’s boots gratis. Mary Jane’s mistress
knew of his existence—in fact she had met him in
the kitchen, and been introduced to him when he
was cornered and couldn’t get away in time, and
she also knew of the boot arrangement. After
this introduction the bootmaking youth found
that Mary Jane’s hoof-cases came round to be
repaired a good deal oftener than before, but he
suspected no evil, and patched them without
murmuring. Then they began to come faster still
—in fact, Mary got a pair mended every second
week, and it occurred to him that she must be
heavy about the feet and dreadfully rough on shoe-
leather. Still it was a delicate question, and he
didn’t like to hint to her that she would be an
expensive girl to keep shod. The next thing that
puzzled him was the strange discrepancies in the
sizes—apparently Mary had feet that opened and
shut like a telescope and could fit any size from
three to eight. He stood that also, but it worried
him a good deal. But when at last the usual
small boy brought round a pair of men’s No. 10’s
he struck, and fled to his sweetheart’s kitchen in
search of an explanation. And then Mary Jane
repudiated all the boots, and he discovered that
he had been trepanned into repairing the hoof-
boxes of the entire family without remuneration—
and, as already mentioned, he wants to know
whether he can have that family arrested on a
charge of having boots repaired under false
pretences.
Queenslanders must have large heads ! The
celebrated firm of hatters, B. Mountcastle & Sons,
Albert-Street, Brisbane, keep hats in stock up to
size 7|.
“Birds in their little nests agree.” Not
always, judging from the Review of Reviews’
extract from an article on “Marriage among
birds”: —“Sometimes the female stork will con-
spire with a young paramour to kill her husband,
just as if she had been a human being.” We
have often noticed the storks in the Zoo playing
at what wo thought was “ follow the leader.” But
we now conclude that it was Joseph Stork running
away from Mrs. Potiphar Stork.
It is a gross scandal that, in a certain
important Australian mining town, all the local
papers are now more or less under the control of a
firm who now bull and bear local mining stock at
their own sweet unchecked will, and float wild-
cat companies, and play the mischief with all
their opponents. In addition to this, they are
close friends with the reigning political party, and
barefacedly distort and misrepresent local public
opinion, besides having secured the powerful
prejudiced favour of the Attorney-General of the
day.
It is estimated that every one of the Mel-
bourne Associated Banks has received and lent
out again about six times its own capital. One
instance; A bank’s paid-up capital and reserve-
funds amount to something over <£2,000,000 ; its
deposits are .£13,100,000; it has lent out
<£13,750,000, besides having a few millions of notes
in currency ! One-fourth of its “ capital ” of over
<£2,000,000 is represented by landed property;
one-third by Government securities; leaving only
five-twelfths, or over .£833,333 odd, in absolutely
liquid form. Suppose a run occurred on that
bank, would it not direly need the combined
assistance of all the other Associated Banks, as
lately agreed upon ?

A London paper has a story about a well-
known publisher coming out of his mansion to
enter his carriage, and recognising one of his
authors shovelling up the snow from the pave-
ment. “Good gracious, M !” exclaimed the
publisher, “you don’t mean to say you are doing
this sort of thing for a living ?” “ And why not ?”
replied the author. “ If you reckon up what you
gave me for my last novel, you’ll see that 5d. an
hour for street-scavenging means a considerable
advance in the price I get for my work.”
THEY SANG ON THE SHIP’S DECK.
“ Home, home, sweet, sweet home ;
Bo it ever so humble there’s no place like home.”
Blessed be the memory of John Howard Payne
for writing this song. Who doesn’t know it?
Who hasn’t sung it ? Fall of hope, full of heart-
break, its melody has girdled the globe. In July,
1891, a large party of Cornish people sat on the
deck of the good ship City of Paris, bound from
New York to Liverpool. They were coming on a
visit home after long absence. And as the ship
ploughed the calm waters, they sang “Home,
Sweet Home.” But a gale came on, and for two
days most of them had other matters to occupy
their attention; they were too seasick to sing.
Then the Welsh coast was in sight, and they sang
once more, louder than ever. And so it goes on
everywhere—illness and trouble spoil the music.
“My wife never knew ivhat it was to be icell.”
Thus writes a husband, and here’s the rest of his
letter. “She always felt tired and languid,” he
says, “and never got enough rest. She had a
dreadful bad taste in the mouth, with a sinking,
gnawing feeling at her chest, and her food seemed
to do her no good. She had also a dry hacking
cough which people said was a “ Churchyard
Gough. ” She went as thin as a shadow and had
to alter her clothes and make them smaller. Now
better and now worse she went on suffering
like this for ten years, and took all kinds of
medicines, cod liver oil among the rest. She saw
several doctors who sounded her chest and asked
if any of her relatives had died of consumption,
leaving the impression on her mind that she was
consumptive herself. Now as her mother had
died of consumption she felt sure she was going
into a decline. Three years ago I was much con-
cerned about her. She had sick headache all the
time, pain in the sides and legs, and used often to
faint, and got so weak I had to take her in my
arms and lift her in and out of bed. People asked
what was the matter with her, but she could
scarcely describe her condition, for it was an all-
gone feeling, making her fit to drop down. Even
going upstairs would exhaust her and make her
feel faint.
In November, 1883, a book was left at the
house, in which my wife read of a case exactly like
hers, and she exclaimed : “That is just my com-
plaint, and as it has been cured by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup perhaps my ailment is not consumption
after all.”
“I got the Syrup and she found relief from the
first bottle, and soon grew quite strong. The
hacking cough left her and she now enjoys her
food. I consider that a bottle of Seigel’s Syrup is
worth more than a week at the seaside. Before
taking this medicine my wife’s life was a misery
to her. You are at liberty to publish this state-
ment if you desire to do so.”
(Signed) J. Jay Smith, Compositor, 25, Sudely
Street, Islington, London.
This is another instance of indigestion and
dyspepsia being mistaken for consumption. Fortu-
nately the little book referred to, revealed the
error in time to enable Mrs. Smith to treat her-
self for her real disease and bring about a quick
recovery. But cases with a less happy ending
constantly occur. We would again impress the
fact upon the public that consumption, rheu-
matism, gout, bronchitis, kidney complaint, and
nearly all affections of the throat, lungs, and
nerves are virtually symptoms of indigestion and
dyspepsia, for the reason that they are caused by
a poison in the blood directly resulting from a
torpid state of the stomach, liver, and bowels.
Therefore, however strongly the indications seem
to point towards one of those so-called diseases,
your true course is to take Seigel’ Syrup, which
removes the radical difficulty which lies at the
bottom of nearly all physical suffering, viz.
indigestion and dyspepsia.
Who has not sometimes said, “ Oh, I have such
a headache—I can scarcely see ?” What makes
the head ache ? Well, the disordered nerves, of
course. And what throws the nerves out of
order ? Let us see.
“For fifteen years,” says Mr. W. D. Evans, of
Brynawel, Mount Pleasant, Swansea, “I had
been a great sufferer from indigestion and
flatulency. I had a bad taste in the mouth, with
pain and distress after eating, and my bowels
became much swollen. I felt languid and out of
spirits, and had great pain across the temples,
which at times was so severe I could scarcely see.
I saw several doctors who were unable to give me
more than temporary relief. In December, 1890,
I told a friend of mine, Mr. W. Lloyd. Rising Sun
Hotel, Morriston, how bad I was, and he advised
me to try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup. After
taking two bottles all the pain and oppression left
me, and I never felt so well in my life as I have
done since. I eat my meals with relish, and feel
light and comfortable afterwards. This remedy
has worked a miracle on me. It is a blessing to
mankind.”
Headaches proceed from indigestion and dys-
pepsia. Use Seigel’s Syrup and your head will
it on your shoulders like a flower on its stalk.
