Our Defensive Forces.
It is difficult to know to what precisely to
attribute the movement afoot to form a
corps of Volunteer Cavalry in the city of
Sydney. Imitation seems to have had some-
thing to do with it, as such a corps has just
been constituted in Brisbane, at the instance
of a Mr. Ricardo, an eX-ofticer in the
Household Cavalry. There is nothing appa-
rently in the political condition of the world
which indicates that a cavalry corps is raoie
likely to be needed in the immediate future
than there has been any time during the
past twenty years. Old residents of Sydney
can remember when just such a troop was
in existence and most gorgeously uniformed
and can also recollect how short a time it
lasted. We have seen it stated that the
German war authorities entertain a convic-
tion that in future wars cavalry will be more
extensively made use of than ever befdre.
This is a remarkable theory when viewed by
the light of the last great war, and the im-
poteucy of bodies of cavalry when con
fronted by infantry armed with breech
loading rifles. It seems most likely that
what is meant is a revival of the old prac-
tise of employing dragoons; who were in-
tended to be simply mounted infantry, but
during a long peace became indistinguish-
able from other cavalry. The value of
mounted soldiers is not to be contested, when
regarded from the tactician’s point of view.
The difficulty of keeping the horses pro-
vided with forage alone limits their value.
An army which can, at a pinch, move sixty
miles in eight or ten hours, is equal to two
armies which can only manage half the
distance in double the time and then
arrive at the objective point in a condition
of physical exhaustion. In the case of
mounted infantry, it would be the horses
only which would be exhausted. The men
themselves might be practically fresh and
ready for action on foot. Every horseman
knows that rapid motion is less fatiguing
than slow, and any Australian stockman
will say that a sixty-mile ride at a canter or
hand-gallop, alternated for the nag’s sake
by spells at walking pace, leaves a man
fresh enough for anything. A troop of
cavalry, modelled on the aid-fashioned plan,
we do not believe would be serviceable, as
such, in the defence of Australia. A Sydney
troop, especially, is likely to be an absur-
dity. Its employment would naturally be
to operate against an enemy just landed, or
lauding, and there are probably not a dozen
tracts of twenty acres of cleared land suit-
able for cavalry along the coast within fifty
miles of the metropolis. In the interior
parts of the colony, the case is different
somewhat. But assuredly the interior would
not look to the metropolis for mounted men.
*
The Australian settler is almost invariably
a fair horseman—a better horseman gene-
rally than the class from which the cavalry
regiments of England, France, and Germany
are formed. And the class of stockmen and
young men on stations are horsemen of the
highest grade, and generally, without being,
Boers or the Canadian back-woods-
men, crack shots, are fairly handy with fire-
arms. There are thousands of such men in
the country who would respond with ala-
crity to a call to arms, and who in time
of war would be ready at one hour’s no-
tice to present themselves with a couple
of good horses, riding one and leading
another, packed, to receive ritles and ammu-
nition, and thenceforth to be ready to
make a dash of a couple of hundred
miles in any direction in any one week.
We don’t mean to say that every smart
horseman in the bush owns two good horses.
But we do mean to say that, even if the
appeal which brought from them as re-
sponse the offer of their lives to defend the
country, failed to equally elicit from stock-
owners the offer of horses enough to mount
every volunteer, it would bo no very violent
or exceptional edict in war time which
would enable every volunteer to help him-
self and give an acknowledgment. The
mobility of such a body of mounted men
operating in Australia would prove proba-
bly greater than any yet recorded in mili-
tary history, because, at the end of any rapid
dash of (say) a week’s duration, the horses
wou’d probably be even fresher than the
men; inasmuch as, in all likelihood, a whole
brigade would reach its destination on horses
different from those it started with, having
re-mounted itself cnroute. Most Australian
stockmen and “jackeroos” are as handy at
breaking and rough-riding as they are at
the elegancies of equestrianism, and, sup-
posing that each trooper led a pack-horse,
as would possibly be the case, or, at any
rate, that each troop had a spare horse for
every man, carrying a pack of provisions
and “swag,” driven in a mob to accompany
it, no treatment would be better suited to
take the rough edge off even unbroken
horses, supposing a sufficiency of broken re-
mounts could not be come across. Fighting
from the saddle need scarcely be contem-
plated. The country is unsuited for it,
generally speaking, and the advantage of
having sharp-shooters plumped down at the
desired spot wherever required, and guffi-
ciently trained to be able to rally in solid
formations at the word of command, would
be infinitely superior to anything likely to
be attained by dashes among timber by
mounted men, or by charges in squadrons
where the absence of trees made the ground,
in old-fashioned parlance, "favourable for
the operations of cavalry.” For it has to be
borne in mind that that phrase is no longer
true to its meaning. Open ground is not
now favourable for cavalry to attack in-
fantry, even when the infantry is in line.
Open ground is quite as favourable for the
operation of foot-soldiers, armed with
breechloading rifles, against cavalry. Dur-
ing the Franoo-Prussian war, for the first
time since the invention of gunpowder, the
spectacle was afforded, in some engage-
ments, of infantry adyancing in open order
in pursuit of cavalry which had attempted
to charge them.
* * •
It is to the inland parts, therefore, that
the colony must look for its mounted de-
fenders. The Sydney troop will do as a
plaything in the meantime. It will include
in its ranks, no doubt, a certain proportion
of men who have graduated in horseman-
ship in the bush, but it will probably be
managed and drilled by officers schooled in
the regular cavalry, who will materially fol-
low the system they have practised, and in-
dustriously stamp out the only useful
qualities of the men. Mounted dudes will,
of course, help to swell the ranks, aud these
will be simply useless, although it is quite
on the cards that the rule-of-thumb com-
manders may reckon them their most apt
and tractable recruits, and, consequent
their most valuable men—till they are
wanted for use. We cannot regard the pro-
posed Sydney troop as a serious organiza-
tion. It is contrary to common sense, and to
the natural conditions which real necessity
would bring out, that the city should fur-
nish cavalry. Artillery and foot-soldiers
are the natural products of a town popu-
lation; and of artillery especially, this
colony, and particularly the coast cities, and
peculiarly Sydney itself, are seriously defi-
cient. It is now generally known that the
permanent artillery is a rotten farce, de-
stroyed by the nepotism and petty tyrannies
with which peaceful times ever infect a
military .body amidst a civil population
which has not learned by bitter experience
the stern necessity of insisting on perpetual
efficiency in preference to every other con-
sideration. The best soldier is the man who
touches his cap to his officer with the readi-
est grace, the most favoured officer the one
who shows the readiest strategical aptitude
for ingratiating himself with a pompous old
Sybarite. The military authorities, who
cannot keep together men enough to man
the batteries, refused the other day to re-
engage a non-commissioned officer because
he had—habitually missed the target at
practice? not at allbecause he had quar-
relled with the cook of the sergeant’s mess.
Comfort Ye, My People.
The people who don’t have to pay—such as
the Peers, and other aristocrats who draw in
pensions, salaries, and so forth, for selves
and families, a thousand pounds for every
one pound they pay into the Treasury—are
quite satisfied to keep on voting allowances
and grants for members of the Royal Family
as fast as these become big enough to hold
out their hats. But the people who do have
to pay, the British working classes, are out
of all patience. Here is what one of their
chief organs says about the matter: —
“It is pretty certain that in the ferthoomlng
session Mr. Gladstone will ask the House of
Commons to grant the Prince of Wales’ eldest son
either ten or fifteen thousand per annum—pro-
bably the latter. At any time, such a proposition
would be scandalous, considering the large income
enjoyed by his father, and the enormous wealth of
his grandmother. When and where, we ask, will
this disgusting mendicancy on behalf of the Royal
family cease? Unfortunately, the countless tribe
of the Queen’s grandchildren—close upon thirty—
are now arriving at that period of life when they
consider themselves entitled to be quartered on
the purse and pocket of the English working man-
How the parents and relatives of these princely
paupers can have the barefaced effrontery, Im-
pudence, and audacity to rattle the begging-box
In their behalf, passes all conception. The Queen
wallows In wealth. A very large proportion of
her people are on the brink of starvation*
When we read of thousands of working men
starving In the north; of children dying by scores
through actual want of proper nourishment; when
trade Is bad and getting worse; when the revenue
is falling, and commerce daily decreasing—surely
such a time is not one for pouring thousands Into
the purse of a youth whose relations possess a
plethora of wealth, and are In the enjoyment of
enormous incomes derived from the public purse!
Again, perhaps this extract from the letter of a
correspondent to the Daily News, now in the
north, may make some impression on the hitherto
impervious hides of sturdy and persistent royaj
beggars and those who encourage them—but we
fear not. He says :—
‘ I have spent some days in house-to-house visi-
tation at various parts of the town, and I could to-
day put my finger upon a dozen oases of families
who are starving’. I take the following from a list
of a hundred cases or more which I have investi-
gated, and for which I have been able to secure
some temporary relief:—!. Three persons living In
a room 16 It. by 16 ft. and 0 ft. high; rent, 3s. a-week;
starving; have notice to quit: soid most of their
clothes. 3. Three persons living in a cellar with-
out furniture; man, woman, and Infant; parents
eating a cabbage; child ill for want of food. ''- Un-
employed labourer and mother (aged 1 8) in attic;
no furniture; old woman on floor-dying, Dr. Blu-
mer reported, for want of food chiefly; no work
this year; last month got money for one week s
rent of present room. In next attic are woman and
child who hgye had no food all day. 4., family ot

One thing is very certain—they will get no help
from royalty or Fawcett, Holms, Dilke, and
others, who in the most unblushing way repudiate
the principles that obtained them power, place,
and popularity.”
And here’s an item of intelligence quite in
keeping
“Dr. Harris, the medical officer of health at Sun-
derland, states that he regrets to inform the public
that the distress in the borough has for some time
past considerably affected the death rate of the
town, especially relating to infants and children.
It is to these deaths that ho calls attention. In the
first quarter of this year, 159 infants under a year
old died; in the second quarter 183. and in the
third quarter the large number of 321. Atrain, as
regards children who are over twelve months, but
under live years old, 95 died in the first quarter,
102 in tbe second, and as many as U0 in the third
Children are dvlng In unusually large numbers.
The weak and the delicate are going first, to be
followed, no doubt, by the stronger. Infants a
few moyths old are dying because their mothers can-
not nourish them* elms, and hence are unable to
sudde their offspring, and cannot bug them the
milk which is so necessary for their existence. Dr.
Harris fears there will be no decline in the mor-
tality unless a strong and systematic effort be
made to relieve the people. Their homes are bare
of furniture, their clothes are scanty, the season
Promises to be cold, and tires are luxuries which
they cannot afford.”
* * •
Now, supposing the Queen were to send
flown a message to the Commons thus:—
‘Gentlemen, It had been my intention to
request you to relieve me of the expense of
maintaining my oldest grandchild by voting
him an allowance of £15,000 per annum.
Since then, however, the people who choose
what they think will please and flatter and
fool me to the top of my bent, in the news-
papers, for me to road to the exclusion of
other matters, have made a slip and per-
mitted me to learn that all the time that I
fancied I was discharging faithfully the
functions of a benevolent and worthy Sove-
reign—the mother of her people—my chil-
dren are perishing in the midst of plenty.
By my children I mean, now that my eyes
are opened, not the fruit of my womb, but
the children of the mother of her people—
those beings whom the Almighty has en-
trusted to my care, and for whom I, deluded
by a retinue of flatterers and traitorous de-
ceivers, have hitherto done nothing; but,
on the contrary, have taken to add to my
superfluous abundance the crust out of their
starving mouths. I have dismissed with
ignominy those treacherous servauts who
have kept me in ignorance of the true con-
dition of my Quecndora, and have led me to
pursue, through misapprehension, a course
which, instead of endearing me to the poor-
est of my subjects, has made me appear the
confederate of a plundering caste, and my-
self the greediest of all the host who fatten
on the wealth wrung by drops from the
agonized brow-sweat of millions of poverty-
stricken wretches. Gentlemen, I have re-
considered my intentions I now ask you to
grant the sum I had in view for my grand-
son, to relieve the immediate and pressing
necessities of at least a few of my unhappy
subjects. I am personally rich beyond the
dreams of avarice, and shall, at least in
future, provide for my own family. Gentle-
men, I fain would be loved by my people;
and, my eyes being opened, I perceive that
the adulation of sycophants is something
very different from the devotion of a nation.
Our common Lord laid down His life for
His people, and I recognise, at length, that
the least I can do is to lay down my hoards
for mine-” Conceive such a message as this.
Why, the shout of ‘‘God save the Queen”
which would arise from all the corners of
the earth would, instead of being expended
in faint and paltry echoes of banqueting
halls, rend the heavens, and, for the first
time, reach Him who had so often been
blasphemously mocked by tipsy and mean-
ingless voicings of the phrase. And, in days
to come, men would repeat, without the
gibes and sneers which now greet the vain
sound of “Albert the Good,” but with
full-hearted endorsement, the name of Vic-
toria the Good.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Modern Exodus.
While our contemporaries are content with look-
ing merely at the political or social aspects of the
great questions of the day, our sound Biblical
training, and that tendency to early piety which
has made us remarkable among modern journal-
ists, causes us to bo ever on the watch to compare
new things with old, and to seize with avidity any
opportunity which may occur of drawing a
parallel between Scriptural narrative and the his-
tory of our own times. Thinking persons cannot
fail to be struck with the singular analogy which
exists between the present position of a certain
section of the Civil Service and the ancient Jews
previously to the memorable exodus of the latter
from the land of their captivity, and when about
to cross the Great Assyrian Desert. The gentle-
men of the Lands Department, about to cross the
salt-bush and myall plains of the Groat Australian
Sahara, are in a somewhat similar condition of
expectant preparation. Each man has his loins
girded with a patent brace, his staff or a ten-and-
sixpenny umbrella is in his hand, his modern sub-
stitute for sandals (No. are on his feet, the
Passover, thinly disguised in the form of vale-
dictory banquets of steak and porter, has been
partaken of; and they now only await the signal to
move forward, while Messrs. Parnell and
Oliver, who may be regarded as the Moses,
and Aaron of the expedition, stop behind to
direct its movements by electric telegraph.
We are aware that, in spite of a general lesem-
blance, many striking points of difference exist
between the circumstance! attending the modern
exodus and those surrounding the old. For
Instance, a pillar of fog w ill be substituted for the
pillar of cloud to guide the Departmental wan-
derers by day; and, asjlt is a species of guide to
which they are already thoroughly accustomed, it
is probable it will also take the place of the pillar
of lire, and remain in constant attendance on the
expedition both day and night. Again, Moses*
with an extensive stock of assorted miracles
always on hand, was unable to get the children of
Israel along at a greater rate than something
like forty miles In forty years, while Mr. Parnell
is serenely confident of having each member of
his little band comfortably seated under his own
vine and fig-tree, and enjoying his own particular
allotment in the Promised Land, in something less
than three weeksl Of course, Mr. Parnell,
though doubtless capable of working miracles
(Parliamentary ones) on a pinch, is not above
making use of the many means of rapid locomo-
tion afforded by modern invention and scientific
discovery ; and, whda the unfortunate children of
Israel had to hump their tabernacle and splodge
along through mile after mile of Assyrian sand-
drift on “Shanks’ pony,” our official pilgrims
will be rapidly transported in luxurious sleep-
ing-cars and the fast-going coaches of Conn
and Co. over limitless areas of black-soil plains
to a Canaan from which the Hittite and the
Peruzite, in the person of the truculent Abo-
riginal, have been already expelled by the strong
arms of a hardy race of pioneers. And, though
doubtless many glances will be cist backward by
yearning pilgrims In the direction of the Bligh-
street hash and coffee palace lunches they are
leaving behind them, they will not bo long enough
intramitu to render any miracles of the quail and
manna order absolutely necessary. Nor will the
smiting of any rock be required before the
Oibulous necessities of the thirsty wayfarers can
be ministered unto, for perennial fountains of
shandygaff and colonial rum can be started in the
most arid districts by a gentle and wood-pecker-
like tapping of the current sixpence of civilisation
on the pine counter of the desert Boniface. Touch-
ing the subject of locomotion, we have often won-
dered why Moses, with unlimited power at his
command, did not take more direct and effectual
means to overcome the difficulties by which he
was oppos d. To invent some vehicle, which
would have been a judicious compromise between
one of Piiaroah’s war-chariots and a Cobb's
coach, would surely not have been more difficult
than to cover all the land of Egypt, including the
august person of Pharoah himself, with lice; and
to have erected, with one wave of hip omnipotent
rod, an iron suspension-bridge with hollow cylin-
drical supports, capable uf transporting any num-
ber of Israelites in safety, and warranted to
crumble to pieces under the slightest pressure of
an Egyptian foot, could hardly have been a more
expensive miracle to get up than his hydraulic chef-
d (Havre of standing the Usd Sea upon its hind legs.
A cheap and substantial tramway, on the endless
rope and stationary engine principle, would have
been of inllnite service in conveying the Hebrew
hosts beyond the reach of their Egyptian tyrants,
and its construction should not have been an im-
possible feat to one who in five minutes could fill
every bed-room In the palace, the boots of Pha-
roaii’s enchanters, and the Princess’ boudoir, with
frogs, and create Hies faster than a prosecuting
policeman can create lies. En parenthesc, what a
fortune might have been made about this time by
the inventor of a really inexpensive and service-
able fly-paper! Thoughts such as these cannot but
occur to the reflective student of Bible history,
who reads with the refulgent rays of the lamp of
Science shining on the page before him; and
though, probably, much that we have said may
have already frequently occurred to thoughful
churchmen such as our enlightened Primate, still
this reflection shall not prevent us from offering
our crude impressions to the theologian and the
commentator. In conclusion, we wish Mr. Par-
nell and the high priests of his department every
possible success in their undertaking. Let him
keep his pillar of fog moving along, and there is
little doubt that under its benignant shadow
every one will eventually shake down into his
proper place. Even then there is no reason why
such a time-honoured institution should be dis-
carded, or why it should not continue to wrap
things as heretofore in its mantle of impenetrable
inscrutability. Its right to brood over depart-
mental deliberations is a prescriptive one; and,
moreover, no one would over recognise the De-
partment without it.
Little Billee.
“ We are familiar with the idea of cycles of mur-
der and of suicide; now, for the first time within
my memory,” observes a writer of a private letter
from England, “ wo have a cycle of cannibalism.
The hideous Mignonette affair follows close upon
the heels oftheGitEBLY Arctic expedition. lam
told that the London Daily Telegraph which,
as is Its wont, served up this awful tale of the sea
in an artistic way and graphically told the story
without reserve—told it, in fact, in what Judge
Manning and the fossils of Sydney would call a
‘sensational’ way—printed and sold on the occa-
sion an extra 50,000 copies. The other journals, the
conductors of which ‘toil onwards as toils the dull
bullock,’ and are the most lamblike set of people
imaginable, simply gave the facts dry and hard as
they came off the telegraph wires, and their ver-
sions of the matter, to which no unusual promin-
ence was’ given, attracted apparently not the
slightest attention. The narrative of the Tele-
graph, which woke up the torpid imagination of
the British public, and which gave the facts not
lees correctly than the rest, engrossed the atten-
tion of the United Kingdom on that day. No
wonder that the Lews are kings among London
newspaper men, and that their journal-which
every day contains £1100 worth of advertisements
at the very least—should have a circulation 70,000
or 80,000 bigger than any other newspaper in
the Empire. It was at first announced that
the three men ‘ had been rescued, and the
boy—(whose body they had eaten)—had died.’
Many a man who read the curt telegram which
prepared the community for the survivors’
‘frenzied confession,’ like unto that of the Ancient
Mariner, muttered to himself, * Yes, the boy died
No doubt. Poor little Bill-eel’ And so it proved.
The well-known * Bab Ballad,’ written a dozen
years ago, might be regarded as a circumstantial
prophecy of the fate of the Mignonette boy. Some
of the French papers, I notice, find in this trag'c
episode an opportunity of attacking (with a terri-
ble cynicism worthy of the land of Kocheeort
and Zola) the British character, * of which,’ says
one journal, ‘the conduct of the survivors aifords
an admirable Illustration. They killed and ate the
boy because be was single. The wolf found many
excuses for killing the lamb. There is a splendid
hypocrisy in the Englishman. Who but John
Bull would have knelt down and prayed before
murdering a dying boy ? The prayer of Monsieur
Dudley was, we are told, a prayer “asking for-
giveness.” It was also the burial service, and
grace before meat. The bachelor does not appear
to have a very good status in England.’ And much
more to the same effect.”
“ shocking Immorality.”
The Chief J ustice, Sir James Martin, in the course
of his letter to the Sydney Morning Herald
last week, referred in severe terms to the fact that
the sanitary condition of Sydney is abominable,
and that, while the existing suburbs are nearly as
bad, “builders, surveyors, and land owners are
preparing, with the connivance and approval of
aldermen and members of Parliament, hot-beds
for the growing of vigorous bacteria, fit to produce
in their development small-pox, typhoid, and
scarlet fever; and, if fortune should favour their
efforts, cholera, as a triumphant climax.” This is
very true. We have ourselves said something of the
kind before now, on several occasions. But where
lies the remedy? The Chief Justice does suggest
one. But we don’t believe that even were His Honor
to throw his talents and influence into an agitation
for the correction of the evils he indicates, he
could stay the pestilential process. Yet, as a matter
of fact, the prevention of further growth of the
evils could be arranged with reasonable facility.
Mr. George Heid, when member for East Sydney*
effected a considerable deal in the desired direo"
tion, by the Act which he got passed to prohibit the
laying out of streets and lanes of less than a decent
width. For this Act alone Mr. Beid will merit to
all time the gratitude of the community. But his
Act only points the way. What is primarily needed
as Sir James Martin points out, is another Act
to prohibit the sub-division of land into minute
allotments. This is a process which has been
going on uninterruptedly for years now, and
is one of the matters to which Sir James particu-
larly refers. The settlement of population upon
petty slices of land, totally unprovided with
sewerage, and each requiring its own insanitary
appendage, is a grievous wrong. People talk with
severe Phariseeism about “ immorality a phrase
the signification of which they have so narrowed
that when immorality is mentioned only sexual ir-
regularities are understood. But the man who, to
grasp the maximum of gain, sells land in such
positions and so negligently laid out that whole-
some living will bo impossible for those who ulti-
mately reside on that land, and that infant mor-
tality is rendered as sure a result as if
the land Jobber turned Herod and visited
his former pr perty with a hand of as-
sassins, is more immoral than the most vicious
and dissolute liver. He organises murder. The
experience of Sir James Martin when he, in
Parliament, endeavoured to carry a Bill to repress
the ravages of these assassins, is not singular.
Early in the history of Queensland, a Bill framed
with similar intentions was passed through the
Assembly. Its provisions stipulated, amongst
other things, that no sections should be sold

We need such a Bill in Sydney. But this system of

The case of Kegina v. Webb, after several post-
ponements, was set down for hearing on Wednes-
day, the 10th instant. As we go to press on that
day, we are unable to comment on the general
aspects of the case. But, without prejudicing
either side, it is permissible for us to explain what
seems to bo not properly understood in reference
to the extraordinary difficulties which have inter-
fered with the prompt and proper hearing of the
case. The explanation of this matter is that,
while the real prosecutor, Sir Henry Parkes,
has managed to shift the expense of his case
on to the broad shoulders of the taxpayers of
the colony, the unfortunate defendant has to
find the means for his own defence, and f
being a poor man, has, from first to last, been
quite unable to satisfy the ordinary requirements
of counsel. The whole mystification and trouble
is thus comprehensible. Mr. Butterwokth's
services were only secured,for the first trial, an
hour before that gentleman went Into Court to
take part in the case, by money being guaranteed
at the last moment which had not been available
earlier to clinch the engagement of counsel. Mr.
Butterworth did wonders lor his client, consider-
ing that not only had he no time to properly study
the case, but, as a new arrival in the colony, he
had no knowledge of the traditions which sur-
rounded the prosecutor and were essential to a
proper comprehension of the matter in all its
bearings.


A party by the name of Johnson —a mere
boy—was cuught in the act of stealing a key from
a chest of drawers in a Sandhurst (Vic.) auction
room. The shopman had, it appears, missed
several keys during the previous day or two, and
so was on the qui vive , with the result stated.
Young Johnson was set at liberty on stating where
ho had disposed of the keys previously stolen; but
we should think—if only for the sake of the fitness
of things—that a boy stealing a key ought to

We knew him when he was as fair
And fragrant, too, as summer air;
Now gaze on him—his brain is dazed,
And his dim “ ocular ”* is glazed;
And he has not a single “ thrum ”
Wita which to purchase his dear rum.
He is a mass of something, that
Is crushed within a bulbous hat;
Is hidden, as he staggering goes.
Within a bulbous suit of clothes.
We knew him, and, with gems bedight,
That lit up lurid in the light,—
This is a fact;
Oh, he was gorgeous in those days;
Yet he sa w far too )nanu plays,
And he would act!
He Spent his all in advertising.
Now 'tis "five bob, or till the rising."

port in Calcutta, doing “Fatlnitza,” the latter in
the title role —for which we learn tiom somebody’s

surprise and concern, serenaded by an enthusiastic
Populace, chiefly composed of the lower orders,

But this is written for publication, and as a gua-
rantee of good faith — South’s compmy (we mean,
of course, his operatic company) has been “ mash-
ing ” Cooma. and their appearance has been suc-
cessfully heralded by Mons. Louis Dubreuil, who
(though an agent) is not impervious to those softer
emotions to which we are all liable. We base this
supposition upon a copy of verses which he has
recently forwarded to anoth-r “distinguished”
operatic artist, of which the following is a vera-
cious extract;—
“ When you are far away, love,
And your thoughts on other dwell,
Will you cast one found (sic) rememberance (sic)
On one who loved you well ?
Who made you his fair idole ” (sic).
■ ■ . . .»
“ 'Tis a question
Too bard to ask of thee,
And yet it is so simple,
Will you ever think of mo.”
“ No! no! When you are far away,
And other feare (sic) And,
You will laugh and say ‘ poor fool ’ ”
There is something about this that probes our
souls. When we see M. Dubreuil, we shall pro-
bably probe his soul—with a skewer .. And Verdi
—dead, too! “We knew him well, Horatio; he
was a man of infinite appetite, who was wont to
set the table on a famine.” We loved him for his
indolence, and admired him for the extreme
dimensions of his “ knocker.” He could tell you
marvellous and stupendous yarns, tales that would
make your hair, if you had any, stand on end —
tales of how he used to pile sideboards against the
doors of his sitting-room, and how colonial duch-
esses, not being able to effect an entrance, would
scale up plasterers’ ladders, and thus surrepti-
tiously effect an entrance through the window.
Verdi was a gorgeous, magnificent, and splendid
artist; and, if we did not know that ho was no
more in his silent tomb than Dan. O’Connor is, but
working his way steadily through his little nine-
teen meals a day in Bombay, we should not say
this. However, as you can call Verdi anything
(when alive) but too late for dinner, we have no
particular scruples anent writing about him....In
Maryborough, Professor Hoffmann, who is con-
juring suites of furniture into the Inhabitants of
that salubrious district, is assisted by Charley
Holly and Collins. Charley Holly, by the way, is
the champion golden-shoe dancer of Tambaroora,
and is likewise possessed (has been endowed
with it, in all probability, by a Divine Pro-
vidence) of the most translucent hiccup ever
known in five hemispheres. ..And do not let us
forget that Herr Kmoch, formerly with the Aus-
trian Band, was thrown from his horse, alighting
on his head, and, not being a member of the staff
of the Evening Alfred, was killed. Alfred, by
the way, is impervious to any danger; for, when
his now historic chestnuts run away, he curls him-
self up in “that hat,” falls safely on the road-
metal, and everybody else in the buggy is killed.
We have it on reliable authority there is only one
weapon extant which could kill Alfred. That
is a bad debt. It is stated that once an infuriated
subscriber to the Down and Gumtree Jernel
hit Alfred on the skull with a bludgeon. The
bludgeon rebounded, and two days afterwards
Alfred attended that subscriber's funeral, with a
smile on him that nearly poked the roof off the
mourning coach ...And think of this—we quote
the Shoalhaven Watson — “During the past
three days, Miss Lucy Ashton’s [and be hanged to
her] Dramatic Company have been performing in
Nowra. On Wednesday last (opening night), * Lady
Aaudley's (sic) Secret ’ was placed before a small

is supported bv that truly great and gorgeous
artist, Harry Flynn, who can paint a house or
play Koderigo with anybody. Lucy is to perform
“ East Lynne ” next. We have, therefore, to sin-
cerely congratulate the Nowraltes on their good
fortune. Miss Nolly Montague (that sweet young
thing!) is also with the “push.” We are not going
to Nowra. “For this relief, many thanks.”. ..

Sir Moses Monteflore was born at Leghorn
on 34th October, 1784. The following is the entry
in the local register at Leghorn, announcing his
birth: “On the 9th Heshvan, 5545 (Oct. 34, 1784), to
Joseph, son of Moses Haim, and Rachael Monte-

During tke course of his nomination-day
speech,;Alderman Withers proudly placed his hand
on his heart and exclaimed: “Yes, gentlemen,
when I was first elected, the sewerage of the upper
parts of Surry Hills was all open, and the filth ran
In a most offensive manner through the lower
parts, and thence by a culvert to Darling Harbour;
but I plunged into the matter extensively, and
what was the result?” [A voice: “A big run on
eau-de-Cologne and iron-hoop scrapers.”]
The Duke of Wellington told the author of
the new book, “ Croker’s Diary and Correspon-
dence,” that, in the Peninsular, the French and
English advance always gave notice to each other
when they were in danger. On one occasion, when
the French army was advancing suddenly and in
force, the French posts suddenly cried out to ours:
“Clear outl Clear outl! We are going to attack
you I” “ I always encouraged this,” remarked the
Duke; “the killing the poor fellow of a vidette or
carrying off a post could not influence a battle,
and I always when I was going to attack sent to
tell them to get out of the way.”
The Grand Duke of Hesse will, after all,
probably succeed in getting quite clear of his
morganatic wife. The German courts, which
must be corrupt right down to the ground, have
by virtually granting a decree, established the
principle that any mean scoundrel who happens
to have been born a “ Duke ” may decoy a woman
to his harem, go through a bogus marriage with
her, keep her for three or four days-or only for
one day. If he so pleases—and then turn her adrilt.
Lord Dundreary, when he said to the pretty girl,
“ Marry me for ten days, my dear, and, If You
don’t like it go back to your ma,” evidently had
taken the exact measure of the Grand Duke

The fact that carlyle described Mr. Glad-

abolish the concern - whlci latter, Indeed, by your
acquiescence In 3uch nominations, and by many
other symptons, I judge to be unconsciously your

circumstance that during Dizzy’s terra of office
Carlyle asked “How long John Bull would con-
tinue to allow that miserable Jew to dauce on his

The Queen has endeavoured to induce

by the Crown Prince and Crown Princess. A
“skit” on the Grand Duke’s marriage with
Madame de Kalomine, entitled “A Midsummer

that the Grand Duke intends to prosecute the

"When the late Mr. A. M. Sullivan, M.P.,
visited ’Frisco, an incident occurred which ho used
to relate with great glee. His countrymen had
prepared him a cordial reception, and an Irish
band marched up to the hotel where ho was stop-
ping, and played “See, the conquering hero.”
There were shouts of “Sullivan, Sullivan I” The
cry attracted a rabble of “ hoodlums,” as the
rough element is called there. Alter a time the
eloquent Home Rule member appeared at the
window and spoke a few sentences. “ Shape your-
self, John; we d rather have that than chin-music,”
yelled one. “ He ain’t so thundering big as I
thought,” said another; “I wouldn’t mind spar-
ring him a round myself” The roughs had taken
him for another celebrity of the ilk, J. L. Sulli-
the bruiser!
George R. Sims (“Dagonet”) is 3G years
old. He Is a “ cockney,” and for some years was
clerk In a mercantile house In the city. In a
literary career of lets than ten years, he has risen
to the front rank as a facile and Hashing writer.
His chief charms are a kindly spirit, a bright wit,
and a bitter scorn of tyranny and Injustice. His
pen is a power In England; he has touched abuses
with it, and they have been reformed; he has
scorched forms of hypocrisy till they withered,
and his Is the proud distinction of having most
successfully drawn the sympathy of the whole
world to the gnawing misery in which the abject
Soor live in London, the mighty modern Babylon,
le is the champion of the poor, his Dagonot
Ballads are noble in their Chrlstly sympathy with
human suffering; he has done more to create in-
terest and pity, and help for the “millions who
darken in labour and pain,” than any writer since
Dickens died. More has been done for Loudon
outcasts these ten years by “ Dagonet’s” pen than
by the whole of the Royal Family in half a century.

The late Mr. A. M. Sullivan, M.P.. had
been known to his own countrymen since his early
youth as a popular speaker and an ardent Nation-
alist, and he was on the whole the most eloquent
debater on the Nationalist side that Ireland sent
to the House of Commons since the days of
O’Connell and Shell. Ho was one of the Irish
members sent Into Parliament to act under the
leadership of Mr. Butt. His first speech In the
Commons won for him a reputation which he never
forfeited. There was much lu his style, his manner,
his language, his opinions, with which an English
audience was not likely to have bet n sympathetic.
His eloquence was fervid In Its nature; his move-
ments were abrupt; he had a great deal of gesture,
and much of it not graceful or effective; he had a
strong Irish accent, and what were then thought
very strong Irish opinions. He was Mr. Plimsoll’s
most active and eloquent coadjutor in the struggle
to obtain legislative protection for the lives of our
seamen. He was a uevoted Roman Catholic, but
many of his closest friendships were with Pro-
testants, and he was a resolute supporter of full
freedom of conscience. He always believed in the
virtue of an appeal to the public opinion of Eng-
land, and he never taught or countenanced the
doctrine of international and internecine hate.
Now, we wonder who was the distinguished
hero of this little tale, which 1s whispered across
from Albion’s sea-girt shore 7 During the course
of their grand triumphal tour, tbe Australian
cricketing team were Invited to spend a day at the
country seat of a noble lady, and anyone who is
familiar with the ways of Our Boys can readily
imagine the alacrity with which they accepted the
generous invitation. Quite a crowd of titled
visitors were Invited to see the kangaroos feed,
and during the course of the evening the fair
hostess supplied the team with the choicest re-
freshments, always taking care to give to one of
the Australians double the quantity she gave to
the others. Flattered by this marked attention,
the favoured joker began to put on frills, and,
taking advantage of a slight lull in the chat, ho
ostentatiously called out, “ Thank you much, me
lady—just a taste moah of y’r strawberries an’
bice; but howls it you always give me .twice as
much as you do to any of my companions here?”
“ Oh, I don’t know, Mr, replied the lady, in-
nocently; “only, as your mouth happens to bo
double as large as the other gentlemen’s, I naturally
thought you could eat double as much as they
could.” Then a grief too great for tears settled
down on that rash young man, and, burying his
face in a a lace Napolitaine. he exclaimed, “ Tell
’em at home that 1 died with my back to the field
and my feet to the foe, an’ the gate-money in my
breeches’ pockets.”
One good point about little Bailey—not
little Bailey of Todgers, but he of the Gundagal
Elworthy-Plugger— is that you can’t put him
wrong, no matter where you locate him, for he is
equally at home on the top of Mount Blanc or In
front of the hottest stove in Hades. Throw him
how you please and he’ll fall on his feet, and he’d
fatten visibly before your very eyes even if you
strapped him down on top of a saw-buck. Not
long ago he was in Sydney for the purpose of
swapping billets with Dr. Barry, or getting a feed
of fresh fish—we forget which; but, anyway, he
was seduced into visiting a church bazaar, and
having been duly robbed and maltreated In the
customary style, he suddenly espied a piano In one
corner of the room, and hastily grabbing a lady
stall-holder by the head, he roared, “ What d’ye
generally do with that tr-unk up there ?” “Play on
it, when we can get anyone to sing,” replied the
fair bandit. “Bing? is it sing?” exclaimed Bailey;
“now, when you talk about singing, you’ve got
to hear me once and then die.” An accompanist
was speedily found, and the little ’un ripped out
“ Let me like a soldier fall ” In a style that caused
his hearers to think far more charitably of the
Nelson’s fog-horn than they ever did before.
“The top C, as ho says himself, “positively elec-
trified the astonished hearers for several miles
around.” And the bazaar holders registered an
oath that If he ever came in again, they’d make
him drunk and then tie him down across the tram
line.
Our old friend fat Arthur, the Tiohborne
Claimant, is, we are sorry to see, dealt with very
hardly by the London papers. One daily calls him
an “Irrepressible liar,’’ and characterises the as-
sertion made in the “ manifesto ” issued by him on
leaving’ prison, that “he heard a Crown official say
in court that unless the jury brought in a verdict
against him they would not be paid,” as “the
most monstrous mendacity of the century.” The
Daily News unfeelingly ' alludes to him as
“Thomas Castro alias Arthur Orton, better known
as ‘the Claimant,’ ” and reminds him that as he is
only out on tlcket-of-leave—three years and four
months of his sentence of 14 years having yet to
expire—he had better behave himself, and not vir-
tually repeat the offence for which he was pun-
ished by setting up a claim founded on perjury.
If Castro is wise,” remarks the D N„ “he will
keep quiet.” Arthur’s pretensions are, in fact,
almost universally ridiculed by the English press;
the Daily Chronicle, which has an extensive
circulation among that extremely democratic
class of whom Arthur’s supporters for the most
part consist, being the only well-known paper
which refrains from characterising him us an
impostor. The Chronicle, too. Is the only Lon-
don paper which has opened its columns to the
time-worn jeremiads of old gentlemen “ who know
old ladies who assure them positively that they
played with Sir Roger Tichborne when he was a
boy, and who say they are ready to swear in
Court that the Claimant and the real Sir Roger are
one and the same person.”
Fronde thus sums up the character of Car-
lyle;—“ Taking Carlyle all in all, there never was a
man—I, at least, never knew of one—whose con-
duct in life wou d better bear the fiercest light
which can be thrown upon it. In the grave
matters of the law ho walked for eighty-flve years
unblemished by a single moral spot. There are no
‘sins of youth ’ to be apologised for. In no instance
did he ever deviate even for a moment from the
strictest lines of integrity. He had his own way to
make in life, and when he had chosen his profes-
sion, he had to depend on popularity for the bread
which he was to eat. But, although more than
once he was in sight of starvation, he would never
do lees than his very best. He never wrote an idle
word, he never wrote or spoke any single sentence
which he did not with his own heart believe to be
true. Conscious though he was that he had talents
above those of common men, he sought neiuher
rank nor fortune for himself. When he became
famous, and moved as an equal among the great
of the land, he was content to earn the wages of
an artisan, and kept to the simple habits in which
he had been bred in his father’s house. He might
have had a pension had he stooped to ask for it,
but" he chose to maintain himself by his own in-
dustry, and when a pension was offered him it was
declined. He despised luxury; he was thrifty and
even severe in the economy of his own household;
put in the times of his greatest poverty he had
always something to spare for those who were
dear to him. When money came at last, and it
came only when he was old and infirm, he adaed
nothing to his own comforts, but was lavishly
generous with It to others.” From all of which
people will be able to see how exactly the sage of
Chelsea Is reproduced in his eminent and consis-
tent disciple, Mr. David Buchanan, M.L.A.
This is positively the extremely very latest
tale told of the persecuted preacher, Peter
and it comes all the way from the Cloncnrry. It
appears that Peter opened fire on the devil in a cer-
tain pub. up there one Sunday morning during the
dry season, and taking for his text the words “Ven-
g ance is mine, salth the Lord,” fired off a tirade
against the popular pastimes of eye-gouging, ear-
chawlng, and rough-and-tumble “ mills,” In a style
that seriously offended the delicate feelings of his
congregation. One of the faithful, in fact—a party
by the name of MacIntyre Mick—openly differed
from Peter during the service, and plainly declared
that “if the Lord was a pusson who would shut
down on the only inneroent amusement a feller
kin find on the back-block, he for one didn’t want
for to hear no more about Him.” The preacher
finished his say, however, and ably pointed out
that there was nothing so mean and paltry as
revenge, and finally he wound up with the old
advice to flabbergaster the man who smacks you
on the right jowl by immediately turning round
the left and requesting him to Larry-Foley that
side also. That night a few of the faithful put an
ingenious mixture of cow-itch, pepper, and bread-
ci umbs in Peter’s bed, and the way the apostle
bucked, and squirmed, and ripped, and cussed in
private for the rest of the night was enough to
scare the soul out of a baked “gohanna.” Out-
side his room,.however, Peter “ spoke never a word
nor wept,” for he had that both inside and outside
of him which passeth show; but he quite patiently
waited his opportunity, dosed all the water-bags
with jalap, and smiled a heavenly smile as his noc-
tural tormenters subsequently left the dinner-table
one by one with a hurried request not to keep any
grub waiting for them, as they had to chop some
wood. Revenge was Peter's that trip, and you
better believe tbe old ’un did enjoy it.
Mrs. Trevelyn is the wife of a colonel in
the army, and separated from her husband who
undertook to pay her a yearly allowance, Lord
Marcus Beresford being chosen to act as trustee.
Mrs. Trevelyn is for many years an inmate of a
workhouse, and alleges that her husband failed to
pay her allowance, and that from Lord Marcus she
could get no satisfaction whatevever. London
Vanity Fair published a letter of inquiry re-
specting the case, and thereupon Lord Marcus
takes dire umbrage, and lies In wait on 1 side
Vanity Fair office to bide the advent of the
editor-proprietor, Mr. Gibson Bowles, who In due
course arrives in his cab, and is at once “boarded ”
by the irate lord, who, with one foot on the step of
the cab, asks his name. The name given, the noble
lord demands the authorship of the letter. Reply,
naturally, and according to all editorial etiquette,
refused; but noble lord is invited to step into the
office and discuss grievances quietly. Noble
lord does nothing of the sort ; but, shov-
ing the editor-droprietor aside, who had his
“hands down” at the moment, goes for him.
Mr. Bowles promptly squares up and “ gives as
good as he gets,” returns the blow, and a sharp
scuffle ensues, the wind-up being the downfall of
the noble lord under the hoarding opposite the
office. Noble lord picks himself and his outraged
dignity up, and asks for his hat and stick. Both
are courteously returned by the office-boy. Utter-
ing curses both loud and deep, the noble lord
enters the nearest cab, and drives off, and Mr.
Bowles, smoothing his ruffled plumes, goes into
his office. The fun of it all now comes in. The hat
given to Lord Marcus Beresford Is Mr. Bowles’s,
and the hat the editor-proprietor picks up, and
sticks to, is my Lord Marcus’s. Moreover, the cab
in which the irate nobleman drives off is the very
identical vehicle that, still unpaid, was waiting for
Mr. Bowles outside the office, and It is to be pre-
sumed that Lord Marcus paid his toe’s fare to the
ambush. Vanity’s only wounds are scratched
knuckles, and, as far as the testimony of an eye-
witness goes, the combatants separated ccquo
marie. The law has the matter in hand.
Dr. Moran is evidently “warm goods,”
and a man who is determined to stick to the strict
letter of the law, whatever he may do concerning
the spirit. That he is a great disciplinarian was
well known long before he “arrove,” but that he
would shut down so soon, and so tightly, too, on
his clargy was certainly neverdreamt of. Amongst
other undesirable little matters raked up by His
Grace of late was the St. Mary’s Sustenance Fund —
a tax which is levied on the per-centage taken by
every church in the diocese, and which goes to
support the princely income of the Archbishop.
When Dr. Vaughan died, the clergy, finding there
was no Archbishop to support, very naturally kept
this tax-money for their own particular benefit,
and clerical banking accounts began to swell up in
the most satisfactory manner possible. Imagine
the surprise and disgust of the apostles, therefore,
if you can, when they received a circular a few
days ago ordering them to ante-up the whole of
this back money without delay, or else—dam-*
nation per omnia soecula sceculorum would cer-
tainly fall upon them. Some, we hear, flatly
decline to part, and others refuse for the best
of all reasons, viz.: they haven’t got it. While
His Grace hss his hand in over this, he might call
for a certified statement showing the exact state
of the banking accounts of the followers of the
meekland lowly Nazarene who had not whereon to
lay His head. We venture to say that, if this were
done and the result published, there would be a
rush of candidates for the priesthood from all
denominations that would set the Church of Rome
on a firmer basis than it has ever been since the
simple days of ojd 8t. Peter. The next rumour
touching the doughty Moran’s deeds is that, on it’s
being brought under his notice that a certain
clergyman had allowed his name to be put upon
the committee of that “gigantic nursery of
patriotism,” as the Celtic Club is sometimes face-
titiously called, the stern disciplinarian and con-
sistent teetotal Archbishop immediately ordered
the clerical Celt to remove his “ moniker ” and sin
no more In that line for the future. This, wo
believe, Is causing “grate dissinshin” amongst
the Celts, and His Grace has got himself quite dis-
liked In consequence. Taking one consideration
with another, the clergy’s lot is not a happy one.
and we are right thankful to-day to find we are

bishop’s crook and the thurifer.
The Claimant’s prison career, as now fully
known, affords food for considerable reflection.
During the ten and a-half years that he has been
in gaol, and under observation every moment,
Arthur Orton, the Wapping butcher, has managed
to comport himself in all respects as Sir Roger
Tichborne, wrongfully incarcerated, might have
been expected to behave. The effort seems super-
human. After sentence, he remained one week at
Pentonville, and then on his removal to Mlllbank
he commenced the real terrors of his I6t, as for
nine months he endured solitary confinement. At
Mlllbank he was employed in picking oakum, an
occupation which afforded him no scope for expert-
ness or cleverness, but in which he was always
diligent. In fact, the Claimant was never a lazy
convict; on the contrary, his fellow-prisoners often
expressed their disapprobation at his doing so much
work. But of late years, due chiefly to the fact
that he had expressed a decided preference for
being left alone, he has experienced none of this
annoyance. At the end of his probation he’was
removed to Dartmoor, where he became a tailor,
but, although he had some years’ practice at the
trade and was always Imbued with a desire to do
his best, he never proved a very efficient workman.
So exemplary was his conduct In prison that he
was never mentioned In the reports—although, in
his remonstrances with his fellow-prisoners on the
subject of his excessive industry, he on one occasion
nearly infringed the regulations. His request to be
sent on the public works that he mightenjoy purer
air was readily acceded to, and he was for a time
employed In the slacking ground in Portsmouth
Dockyard. He soon discovered that he was here
subject to be gazed upon by workmen and others
in the dockyard, and to the least semblance of this
practise he always showed the most deep-rooted
antipathy. His next move was to the carpenter’s
shop, which is much more secluded. It was not
anticipated that he would prove a better carpenter
than tailor, but he has turned out a really skillful
workman, and would have no difficulty in earning
his living at this handicraft. Not only did he prove
industrious, but he took a real interest in his work,
and would on entering the shop throw off his cap
and frock, roll up his shirt sleeves, and go about
his work with real earnestness. He was never the
devoutest of Catholics. He always abstained from
mass or going to confession, while the church ser-
vices, which are compulsory, he always attended
In a perfunctory fashion. The late Dr. Kenealy
paid the Claimant only one visit—at the time when
the Court of Error was being prosecuted, and he
then distinctly warned his old client not to be de-
ceived by what his other friends told him, and to
make up his mind that the case would fall. The
Claimant, nevertheless, buoyed himself up with
hopes of success. He was at the same time allowed
to grow his hair and whiskers, and was actually
measured for clothing to be worn by him on the
day of his expected liberation. When experience
proved the soundness of the advocate’s advice, the
Claimant was ill-prepared for the news. He ra-
pidly turned grey, and has been ageing ever since.
On one occasion the Claimant had a visit from
Captain Barry, who, in a somewhat curious
fashion, recognised the prisoner as the Sir Roger
Tichborne whom he knew at Wagga Wagga. The
Claimant was three times visit'd by his eldest son,
named Roger, and once by both sons together, and
it is said that Roger’s physiognomy bears an exact
resemblance to the daguerreotype of Sir Roger
Tichborne, which will be remembered as one of
the exhibits in the case. His consent to be inter-
viewed by his sons was the result of a prolonged
Ere«sure on the part of his friends, as the Claimant
ad a great objection to,any of his chil iren seeing
him in the convict garb. He on all occasions
evinced a profound taciturnity, and did everything
in his power to foster the unwillingness of his
friends to talk to him. He would never call in the
doctor if he could help it, and be was never known
to attempt a joke during his imprisonment. Most
of his leisure ho spent in reading such books as
Roman Catholic prisoners are allowed to peruse,
and he confined himself chiefly to works of travel
or voyages. He would make no attempt to im-
prove his education, while the letters from him
that have appeared ia the Press from time to time
often took him weeks to prepare, and were never
dispatched until he had made copious references
to the prison library. His sDht has of late years
become considerably impaired, and he lately never
attempted to read or write without wearing
spectacles.
Amare et sapere vlx deo conccditur— to be
in love, and at the same time act wisely, is hardly
granted to a god—was a neat little saying which
was very much believed in by the ancients, and
certainly, judging by the extremely asinine capers
of some of their deities when under the spell of
the sweet passion, the old ’uns had just grounds
for their pithy observation. Why we think of this
to-day, is simply because we have been wading
through a few tubfulls of 398 love-letters written
by the late Lord Bulwtr Lytton to Miss Bosina
Wheeler—the lady who had the subsequent mis-
fortune to be his wife. These letters pretty fully
exhaust the whole vocabulary of amatory decla-
mation, but, as Miss Louisa Devey (their pub-
lisher, and Lady Lytton’s executrix) points out,
their want of reticence and dignity too clearly
betray a sensual abandonment to what might be
called the “love of a Bashaw.” “Puppy” was
the pet name of the author of “ Pelham,” and
“ Poodle ” of his lady love in their sappy days, and,
just to show bow the arrows of the mischievous
littie god can send a talented man clean off his
kadoova at times, here’s a copy of one of Bulwer s
early letters written over the sublime signature of
“Oo own Puppo”: “My adored Poodie,— Many,

“Willing” is the name of the very latest
parlour amusement out In London, and It is the
outcome of the thought-reading mania started by
Irving Uishop and Chamboriayne. As no deception
or hanky-panky business of any kind is allowed,
the game is interesting, and rather startling results
are sometimes obtained. This is the style in which
it’s played. Three persons are required to enact
•• willing,’' two of whom decide out of earshot of
the third on some action he or she shall be "willed”
to perform. The one to be “ willed ” is then blind-
folded, while with hands joined round his or her
waist-[this is a most pleasing part of the perform-
ance when the “ willed ” one is a young lady]—and
thoughts steadily directed to the object in view,
the other players “ wish” with all their might that
their decision shall be carried out. In some cases,
the result is rapid enough to be startling, the party
blindfolded, after a few moments’indecision, mov-
ing in the required direction, and either perform-
ing tne very action required or else something very
like it. In one case recorded the hands were barely
placed on a gentleman before he started off and
performed the feat allotted—which, by the way,
was rather awkward forhlmself, ashewas “willed’ 5
to walk through a certain folding-door, in front of
which a deep excavation had been previously made
unknown to the players, and into which the blind-
folded party jumped with a souse that loosened
nearly every bone in his body. In cases where the
person to be “ willed ” is a symmetrical young
maid of sweet 17, or so, it has been found neces-
sary to limit the hugging time to a quarter of an
hour, and in case no results have been recorded
up to that time, the other two players (males, of
course,) are dragged away by steam power or
trained elephants which are kept for the purpose.
Care must be taken in the choice of the tasks
allotted, however, or little unpleasantnesses may
occur, as was the case when a piece of newspaper
was thrown on a certain parlour floor, and the
blindfolded one-a bashful young curate—was
“ willed ” to pick it up and place it on his head.
While the “willing” was going on ln"lhe next
room, the lady hostess, who knew nothing of the
game going on, entered the parlour, and unfor-
tunately stood on the all-important slip of paper.
Persons with a phenomenal power of imagination
may conceive some faint idea of the surprise the
lady subsequently felt when she found her rever-
end friend down on his knees endeavouring to
lift her feet on top of his head before all the
company, but no one could possibly imagine the
shame and horror of the poor young curate when
his winkers were taken off and the matter fully
explained to him. “ Willing ” is a game that has a
deal to recommend it, and in the now world-famed
words of the only Alfred, it should “ take wei, and
give grate pleshir tu orl.”

Boots K .” Ou the 29th August, 1827, Puppy
and Poodle were married in London, but, strange
to say, no record was made of the loves, and
kisses, and bites, &c , which the young spoons
lavished upon each other over the glad occasion.
Five years after this there was more of the biting
business carried on, but in a somewhat different
fashion. The “puppy ” had grown to be a mastiff
dog, and from a record left by Lady Lytton we
read:—“Upon his asking me with whom I was
going to the christening of Mr. Ponblanque’s child
that night, and I replying ‘ with Lady Stepney,’ he
then repeated as fast as he could, a dozen times
running, ‘ My mother calls her that ugly old
woman.’ He then called out, ‘Do you hear me,
madam?’ Of course I hear you.’ ‘Then why
the in don’t you answer me ?’ ‘ I did not
think it required an answer.’ ‘ D your soul,
madam I ’ he exclaimed, seizing a carving-knife
(for we were at dinner, and he had told the servants
to leave the room till he rang), and, rushing at
me, cried, ‘ I’ll have you to know that whenever I
do you the honour of addressing you it requires
an answer!’ I said, ‘For God’s sake, take care
what you are about, Edward!’ He then dropped
the knife, and, springing on me, made his great
teeth meet in my cheek, and the blood spurted
over me. The agony was so great that my screams
brought the servants back, and promptly Cresson,
the cook, seized him by the collar; but he broke
from him, and, seizing one of the footmen’s hats
in the hall, rushed down Piccadilly." In 1836, a
formal deed of separation was signed, Mr. Bulwer
flatly declaring he would never, under any con-
sideration, live with his wife again. Eheu! ’Twas
ever thus. We are all blind puppies before mar-
riage; but once the deed is done, our eyes are
opened wide, and the snarling days begin.

The latest idea in trophies for manly
sports comes from Ballarat. The members of the
local fire brigades have, tor some months past,
been undergoing a vigorous and arduous training
so as to compete successfully in a tug-of-war con-
test, for which a varied assortment of valuable
przes were offered. And when the City Brigade,
after a terrific struggle, were proclaimed the
victors and went to claim the trophy, they were
presented with an assortment of German sausages,
fiat-irons. Holloway’s pills, Epsom salts, bars of
soap, and weather-beaten vegetables, so that the
noble fire-fighters were under the impression that
they had won the stock-in-trade of a small country
store. The firemen were just a bit surprised at
their success In pulling off such a big pool, but
astonishment gave way to disgust and profanity
when the value of the goods was appraised. How-
ever, Ihe now system of rewarding our athletes is
nob without its advantages. See what an incen-
tive would be given to the Rum scribes and the
Nooze reporters to go in for the cultivation of
muscle, were the Ballarat system introduced here.

A POPULAR MINSTREL MADE HAPPY;
OR, FROM JEST TO EARNEST.
“ For seven years,” writes Mr. Horace Bent, of
the Federal Minstrels, “ I have suffered from an
acute neuralgic affection of the right knee and
rheumatic gout, which became so severe during
our season at the ‘ Gaiety ’ in September, ’83, that I
was obliged to relinguish the active duties of my
profession and keep my room for a couple of days.

limes, some of which gave me partial relief. In

ments until a friend who happened to be in my
room whilst I was complaining of intense pain re-
minded me of its claims, and sent out for a bottle
right away. I u?ed a little of it immediately, and
found instant re ief, repealing the application
again later on in the evening. From that night l

The late Mr. A. M. SulUvan died of disease
brought on by overwork. This being so, the
longevity of The O’Sullivan Is assured,
Mr. 0. Norman is to be a can didate for the
Namoi at the general election next year. He is a
surprisingly energetic man in his business (stock
and station agent), considering bis very great
weight. But he carries his flesh like a man, and is
as active as a kitten.
The Kapunda Herald’s Adelaide corre-
spondent says “ the main duty of a second branch
of the legislature is to check hasty legislation.”
How would it read if it were only true for once,
that “the main duty of a second branch ot the
legislature is to hasten checked legislation ? ”
The Republican form of Government is
doomed. The Central Australian (published
at Bouike) has unhesitatingly condemned it. But
as no one at Bourke cares what the Central says;
and, as it is only used as a soporific by subscribers
outside Bourke, there may bo a chance for Repub-
licanism yet.

The Chief Secretary of South Australia
has his own notions as to the stuff Irom which

“fit as a fiddle.” There is Mr. Ellis, and —but
why go on ?
The Executive are spending a good deal of

It is an open secret that the Rev. John
Osborne intends to have a shy at Parliament next
general election. His politics will be all right, be-
cause he has none in particular just now, and will

But one of his future supporters, being anxious
about his religion, said, “ What do you believe

It does not take much in New South Wales
to get ud a “celebration demonstration.” The

South Australia, even in this line, can give us
points. They demonstrated and celebrated, in the
proper way, the opening of a bridge at Gawler,
the other day. And the total cost of that bridge
was £80 18s.
Mr. Angus Mackay finds a difficulty in
getting members to hear him in the Victorian
Parliament. This arises from the fact that mem-
•bora do not care to hear him_ Last week, as a
right, he claimed the undivided attention of the
Premier (Mr. Service) to what be had to say. So
soon as he began to talk, Mr. Service got up and
went out. It is his voice that does it, as much as
anything. It sounds as if it came through a nut-
meg grater and a hearth-rug.

The Minister for Mines found Bourke and
Brewarrina the most hospitable places he had ever
been in. And he was right. It will take some
years for the railway to efface the good old times
there. But in politics the district is much the
same as any other. At the first contest after it had
been declared an electorate, ini 1880, a carrier an-
nounced hi# intention of stopping in Bourke with
his team for a week, to vote, no matter how much
it would cost him. He was nskad what hispolitical
views were, and he promptly replied, “ Well, I’m
going to vote against Barton; he ’pounded my
horses.”
This is what the elder Mr. Weller would
call “a pint of domestic policy.” Is the Civil
Service run for the benefit or the country, or is
the country run for the benefit of the Civil Ser-
vants? These questions are not unnatural, in view
of two advertisements in last week’s Herald.
In one of them a gentleman in the Civil Service
expresses his desire to enter into negotiations with
a Clerk of Petty Sessions with a view to the ex-
change of billets. In the other, a clerk in the
General Post-office states his willingness to ex-
change with a clerk in the Lands-oflice who wishes
to stay in Sydney; salary, £156 a year. This is all
very nice, but is it conducive to the good working
of the General Post-office or of the Departments of
Lands or Justice ?
Speaking with respect to the Franchise
bill, Mr, CnamuerJain, M.P., said : “If this Bill
were carried, It would still be possible to say that
this country—the boasted home of freedom—had
shown less confidence in the wisdom, patriotism,
and intelligence of tne people than other nations
which he could refer to. In the United States the
proportion of electors to the population was 25
per cent., or one in four. In France the popula-
tion was twenty-six per cent., or rather more than
that of the United States, and In Germany it was
twenty per cent., or one in five, in England at
the present time only nine per cent,—only one in
eleven—possessed the franchise ; and when the
Bill passed and the two million electors were ad-
mitted there would only be fifteen per cent, on the
roll, or little more than half the proportion in the
United States and France, and only three-fourths
of whgt obtained io the great empire of Germany.
(Hear, hear.) In his judgment, that was not
enough; but he only appealed to these figures in
order to show that they did not propose a revolu-
tionary measure, or one that sensible men need be
afraid of.” Englishmen should not rest till they
have manhood suffrage.
His Excellency Prince Li Hung Chang, the
Chinese statesman who was so closely associated
with Gordon during the Taeping war, and who
was regarded by Gordon as the ablest Chinese
potentate in the Empire, was interviewed on Sep-
tember 30 by the United States Minister. Amongst
other things, Li Hung declared “M Jules Ferry
has made a mistake in seizing on the Langson mis-
adventure as a pretext for a war with China. He
has adopted a false policy, misled thereto, pro-
bably, by the belief that China is still in the condi-
tion she was in 30 years ago, when France, in
alliance with Great Britain, marched successfully
to Peking with only San-ko-lin-sin’s undisciplined
levies to oppose them. We had no choice then but
to surrender at discretion. For, at the time, we
had the Taeping rebellion on our hands, and no
Chinese statesman was then acquainted with
foreign affairs. We were without military re-
sources. Now the situation is entirely changed.
There is no trouble in the interior of the country,
and our coast defences, moveable and stationary,
are immeasurably superior to those of the former
time. And are matters not somewhat changed
with France also ? I am told that her finances arc
not altogether In a satisfactory state, and for that
and other reasons she can 111 afford to despatch a
large expedition to the East. But bo that as it
may, unless they are able to avail themselves of
tactics which served their turn so well at Foo-
chow, the French will not find it so easy to cap-
ture our fortresses, much less to hold them. 1 am
an old soldier, .having commanded troops in dif-
ferent provinces for thirty years, and I have in
my service many trusty officers, American, Eng-
lish, and German, on whose fidelity I can rely.
You would do well, therefore, to advise the
French Government that if Courbet Is to ‘con-
tinue his operations,’ as they call it, he will have
need of vreater circumspection than was de-
manded of him at Foochow to ensure the safety
of his fleet.”

WHAT THE ENGLISH PEOPLE SAY.
High above the clash of parties swells the shout of
those who say:
Wa are marching on to Freedom; who are ye that
bur the way ?
Duke and marquis, lord and lordling, what are ye
that we should wait
In our millions, while ye listen to our thunder at
the gate ?
It were wise and well, your Lordships, clear from
out the way, before
Ye arc asked with stern persistence by what right
ye guard the door.
Ah f ye scorn our vast processions ? Not by these
slhall ye be cowed ?
These are frolics of the masses, and the humours
of the crowd ?
It is true our martial music, mighty meetings,
platform talk
Are not action; but your Lordships is it wise at
these to mock ?
For beneath this proud “parading,” and these
blazoned flags we “flaunt,”
Flows a people's steady purpose, strong in know-
ing what they want;
And we hope to teach your Lordships, in the stern-
est sort of school.
That the people’s will is final, and the strongest
hand must rule.
When the civil struggle closes by your noble
House begun.
When the hurly-burly’s” over, “ when the battle’s
lost and won.”
Ye shall find the path of progress wider, stralghter,
freer made,
And our ancient throne’s foundations “even yet
more firmly” laid;
Ye shall find the people rising to the zenith o."
their hope.
Stronger in the strength of freedom with an
Empire's cares to cope.
Not to-day, nor yet to-morrow, may the fair ful-
filment be.
But, your Lordships, we arc marching, and we
shall—wo shall—be free.
A couple of weeks ago we commented In a
leading article upon the remarkable declaration
by the chairman of the English Congregational
Union denouncing the present land system in
Great Britain. Reynolds' London Newspaper,
circulation 650,000, has something to say on the
same theme. Reynolds’ evidently regards the
Rev. Dr, Parker as a sort of Mr. Facing-Both-
Ways, or Mr. Worldly-Wiseman, and, with our
own observation of modern Congregationalists, we
don’t wonder. In the days of thoir pristine vigour,
the Congregationalists, or Independents as they
were then chiefly called, were v igorous, and nearly
freethinkers. They had no regard for sham® or
gilded evils. A king, in the ir view, was not a
demi-god, but a man whose function it was to live
not on, but for, the people. It was Congregational-
ists had most to do with c hopping off the head
of that really dignified and se Lf-satisfled and well-
meaning humbug, Charles I., whose otherwise
dmirable character was corrupted by his regal
onviction that the Almighty had made him of
different clay from other Britons, and that they
existed for the purpose prj marily of prov ide#
him with money. Latter-day Congregationallsts
are weak-kneed creatures whenever they have
got rich. They hanker after aristocratic recogni-
tion, and ape the ideas as they do the customs of
horn aristocrats. We remember a noted Sydney
Congregationalist lelling us that when Albert the
Good for Nothing died, he xvept. However, to
return to our starting point, here e how Rkynouds’
rallies the Rev. Dr. Darker“ But he anticipates
a time when the land shall be held and cultivated
into plentiful harvests by people who had heard a
gieat voice from heaven saying, ‘ The earth is the
Lord’s and the fullness thereof.’ This is a very
effective peroration; but is anything practical to
come of it ? Will they bring their earnestness to a
practical test ? The Highland Crofters are now in
extremities owing to the condition of the Scotch
law. Even as we write, they are being subjected
to harsh and even cruel evictions at the hands of
rapacious landlords, and, in their despair of re-
dress, they are signing an engagement not to act
in the Naval Reserve or any other service. Will
Dr. Parker and the leading representatives of
Congregationalism manifest their earnestness on
the Land Question by demanding suspension from
eviction for the Crofters until Parliament has time
to consider their case ? After the tall talk of yes-
terday, it would be desirable that some practical
result should follow.”
Respecting the “trial” and execution of
eight Nihilists—a lieutenant-colonel, a staff-cap-
tain, a lieutenant, a naval lieutenant, a navigating
lieutenant, a sub-lieutenant, and two ladies, one
priest’s daughter—a London paper remarks:—
“They were pat to death in the presence of the
prison officials, the Minister of the Interior, and
the Minister of Justice. The public knew neither
the day nor the hour of the event. But the cir-
cumstances of this secret execution, grim and
weird as they are, sink into insignificance when
compared with the trial which preceded it. These
criminals, as we will assume them to have been,
were tried as privately as they were put to death.
Hardly any one was admitted into the court ex-
cept the judges, the advocates, the witnesses, and
a Minister of State. There was no jury. The
Chief of the St. Petersburg High Court of Justice
presided, but the tribunal was a court-martial.
Fourteen persons were sentenced to death. The
Emperor, however, has commuted the sentence
upon six of them. The charge against all was that
they belonged to the terrorist party of the Will of
the People. One professional judge and ten colonels
tried and condemned indiscriminately a number of
people, some of whom were civilians and could not
therefore have committed a military offence. The
proceedings were conducted in a small house,
without t.ie knowledge even of those who in-
habited the same street. We need not waste
words in showing that under such a system there
oan be no security for the administration of Jus-
tice, or oven for the observance of law. Anyone
obnoxious to the Court or to the Government
could be put out of the way on the evidence of one
perjured informer, or without any evidence at all.
Wo do not say that It was so in this ease. These
prisoners may have been found guilty on testi-
mony which would have satisfied any jury. Where
is the guarantee? The judges answer for the
guilt of their victims. Who will answer for the
judges? No Russian newspaper dare protest. In-
deed, there are very few Russian newspapers left.
The object of Count Tolstoi’s administration is, of
course, to intimidate the members of a formidable
and widespread conspiracy. But a general terror
which affects the Innocent does not deter the real
culprits. The Nihilists are indeed a source of
deadly peril, especially when there is nothing in
the shape of liberal or representative institutions
between them and absolute despotism. Yet eveu
Nihilists might bo detected and punished without
shocking the feelings of civilised mankind.”

Said Mr, Chamberlain, in a recent speech:
—“ 1 begin to hope that a Welsh friend of mine
was right when he told me that whereas at the
last general election a hansom cab would have
been enough to take the Tory raembersfrom Wales
to Westminster, at the next general election a
perambulator would be much more than suffi-
cient.” T. N. Harvey” writes from Waterford
to the Pali-. Mali.:—“ Ireland has been organised
and educated to a degree that makes success at
the polling not probable, but certain, and the
highest estimate of numbers of members of the
Parnellite party will probably be nearest the
truth. When you have a compact body of, say,
seventy-five members voting as a unit on all im-
portant questions, there may be some difficulty in
carrying on the Queen’s Government.” Scores
of workmen and their children are dying of star-
vation at bunderland. Yet, when that libidinous
vagabond, the “Grand Duke of Hesse,” who had
come over to England on business connected with
his harem, was about to return, the Queen placed
at his disposal for the voyage the Royal yacht, at
a cost to the taxpayers of no end of money....
The late Chief Secretary for Ireland, Mr. Trevelyan,
is still protected by a detective, who accunpanles
him everywhere The Tory peers have been
making very merry at the threat of extinction
levelled at them. '1 hey should remember the fate
of Chalchas, the soothsayer, who roared so heartily
at his having outlived the time predicted for his
death that he fell down in a tit and expired on the
spot. Great merriment has very otten preceded
immediate dissolution. The gay ha* led to the
grave. Margutte died of laughter at seeing a
monkey try to pull on a pair of boots. Zeuxis, the
painter, laughed so heartily at a hag which he had
just depicted tjiat he dropped all of a heap and was
taken up a corpse. Philomenes died of laughter
at seeing an ass eat the tigs intended for his own
dessert.
A STUDY OF AN INTERIOR.
“ For heaven’s sake, how much more are
you going to eat of that salad ? You’ve put
away a half-gallon of it already.” Fender-
son : “Noneuse, I’ve only eaten a mouth-
ful.” Fogg: “That’s what I said.”

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist’s art. It looks like
gold, it is as heavy as gold, and it is more enduring.
None but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by,the severestltests. Ornaments made
from this new composition are equal in design and
general appearance to .those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe
ofltbe Cost of the genuine goods.
Remember that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is anything but a composition of pure metals;
but wo do affirm that it is so perfect an imitation
of the sterling gold as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of it may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. 8o perfect is it, and so
large has our trade become, that Jewellers through-
out the colonies are complaining of the dullness in
trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their owu customers. But as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is slumped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
be sent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE.
Should you be dissatisfied with your Investment
alter inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where mails are few, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured -we
will return the money, deducting only the trllle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the retained. Fair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and send in your
order for what you mayirequire.

“ Bobadil ” still at the Opera House It is
not easy to discover or Invent anything fresh to
say of it, except that the people rol’ up, part with
their money, and leave apparently satisfied. At
least, they fro away and say nothing. The only
artist likely to cause a bombardment is the police-
man. Why he is suffered to come on at all, or,
having appeared, why he is allowed to get away
without being knocked endways with a brick from
the gallery, is to us a dark and impenetrable mys-
tery. He is not necessary; he is not entertaining;
he provokes no mirth. The laughter that follows
his advent is not gay, but hollow and minatory.
It is the glee of imps, as they crowd round a defunct
bishop to truss him for roasting. We warn this
person that he will get his uniform torn once too
often—that some of the skin will come with it
one of these nights, and that his pure Celtic accent
will reach the public without passing over teeth.

What do we really think of “Bobadil”?
Well, the fact is, now we’ve had time to turn the
matter completely over, we think it a really re-
markable work. This is mere trilling, is it ? So.
You’ve seen little articles of Chinese and Japanese
bric-a-brac—wee models, where men’s heads are
joined to animals’ bodies. The combination may
be very dextrous, but it is disappointing. So with
a good deal of the music of “ Bobadil.” You hear
a few sparkling bars, and, sitting well back, you
say “ Ah, there’s melody at last.” But, with some
exceptions, the sweet air falls into the hands of a
stepmother, and is either strangled in its youth or
so warped by cruel treatment as to grow up hunch-
backed and rlcketty—its early promise unfulfilled,
its cuckoo nature showing Itself with each fall of
the hdton. It is as if Kendall wrote the first two
lines of a sonnet and Indolently threw them to—
(we leave out names, as we’re not yet in a fit state
to meet our Maker)—to mortice on the remaining
twelve. This, we say, is the character of much of
the music. But it is only fair to add that there are
melodies in the work which do not lose themselves
in a labyrinth nor run bald-headed up a cnl-de-mc t
but, getting off well at the start, keep up a rattling
pace to the finish. Many of the choruses, too, are
pleasing and effective.
♦ ♦ •
In “Bobadil” there are two performers—
Mr. Harding and Miss Plaisted. Of course, there
are others on the bill, but they are mere spectres,
gloomy and Plutonian, with two exceptions-Mr.
Leopold and Mr. Deering. in an old country like
England, where there are rich churches to be
robbed and rich houses offering every facility to
the enterprising burglar, or in a new land like
this where there are bricks to be wheeled and
turnips to be raised, it is little less than amazing
how the “ profesh ” still keeps up its supply of
recruits. They come like shadows, but they never
depart. They will sing and act. till you sigh for
some abysmal Atlantic hollow over which to
jettison tnem. But, enough. Like Weller, junior,
“ven ve gets on this ’ere grievance ve runs on
like anew barrow vith the v heel greased.” As
Shacabac, Mr. Leopold reminded us something of
Sam Keenan. Possibly he took the latter for a
model. But he had not his cavernous mouth and
phenomenal ears. As general “ knock-about ”
man" and “chucker-out,” also, he was a long
way behind Sam. While ho was fooling about
witn his innocuous wooden scimiter, or Bustling
Inoffensive eunuchs, Sam would have had the
whole Sublime Porte standing on their heads and
the Caliph’s spine hanging out between his teeth.
As for Mr. Deering, you might worship him with-
out committing idolati y. He was like nothing m
earth, air, or water. He may, perhaps, resemble
the old sceptic who was glued to the moon for
“shaking” sticks on Sunday, but, failing that.
Nature might be ransacked in vain for a mate for
him Even a looking-glass wouldn’t reflect him
nronerly. Of the Caliph and his son we’re not
bound to say anything. It is a critic’s privilege to
keep silence when he likes.
• • •
Some people don’t like Mr. Harding’s
voice We do. And we like Miss Plaisted’s. She
is petite, but he voice is not. It is sweet, distinct,
and far-reaching. On her and Mr. Harding the
Sydney success of Bobadil has mainly de-
pended, and they have not been found wanting.

It was Romenyi’s last night. From floor
to celling, tier upon tier, rose a sea of expectant
faces. On the roof could be heard the patter of
tiny feet and the shrill alto of childish voice?,
awed into momentary quietude by the occasional
tread of a fireman. Through every window, it om
every niche and cranny capable of supporting life
and bulk, peered eager eyes, all focussed on the
door through which the maestro was to enter. On
stout ropes across the great hall, high above the
Land? of the seething mass below, were festoons
of ypuihs and maidens, laughing, chatting, and
revelling in the innocent gambols so natural to the
sDringtida of b®iug, when existence is a pleasant
dream and life's young May moon has not yet Be-
come gibbous. Wit, pungent as is diurnaiiy iiashed

ft was no wonder the Turners sang well

In front of such a crush should keep a or
take in washing. Let us offer a little suggestion.
“Muritana” is the choictst English oprra. Com-
pared with it, the “ Bohemian Girl,” “ Satanella,”
and as many others as you can think of, occupy
seats ever so far back. Every air is familiar. Why,
then, before the conductor’s hdtnn starts the first
note in the orchestra, are not the enfants terrible*
who prowl round with “ books of the words and
songs,” gigged and thrown down a tank? For-
tunately the trombone had a few bars to worry
through at the beginning of the overture, so that
the little ghouls’ squeaks could make small head-
way. But when that fascinating instrument ceased
its dulcet strain, and the maestro who wrestled
with it turned to the big drum for; a chew of to-
bacco, the Addles took up the running, and high
above them soared the maddening importunities
of the youthful “ opera-book ” Aends. Of course,
it may be said there's no tank handy, but this is
the merest trlAing with the question. Mr. Cole-
man should see to this. An ingenious fellow like
him could surely adopt some means short of down-
right inhumanity to wipe out this nuisance before
custom renders it too formidable. During the
overture to “ Fra Diavolo ’’ a few nights ago, some
of the daintiest movements had to work their pas-
sage through a running Are of discordant solici-
tation.
* * •
At first we paid little attention to the
music. Coleman was sitting behind us with a
bouquet as big as a banyan tree. He must have
got it through the sky-light with a windlass when
our back was turned. “ What will ho do with it ? ”
occupied our mind to the exclusion of all else.
Will he barter it for alcohol, or, by means of a
catapult, aim it with deadly effect at some inoffen-
sive person on the stage ? The mental tension be-
came sickening. Then we turned to him and said,
“Ylllainl either you or we leave this, unless you
tell us how you came by that conservatory, and
what you’re going to do with it.” He drew him-
self up to his full height, smiled bitterly, called
the door-keeper to give him a hand and lelt. Then
we spread for work.
♦ * *
Chorus first. We missed some well-re-
membered faces—faces that on many a dreary night
kept us from hiding our sorrows in the Yarra or
the storm-swept waters of Port Nicholson. Many
a time in the long ago, when struggling with the
demon of remorse, have we gone home to bed
hungry but contented, after viewing the placid
immobility—the cheery light-heartedness—of those
absent ones. To see them come on as soldiers in
helmets of the most antique pattern and recondite
material; as peasants in hose of the most depress-
ing cut; as courtiers in the heterogeneous Anery
of a dead century; to see them drink imaginary
“ wollop ” from crystal goblets of mahogany, and
(yes, by ,) ask for “more;" all this, with the
prospect of the ghost’s being unable to walk on
pay-day, Induced us to live on. But we digress.
Although, in severe moral rectitude and feet, the
present chorus are well abreast of the tim.-s, the
same can scarcely be said for their voices. They
lack repose, too. Among them the caste of Vere do
Yere does not appear to be adequately represented.
The ar* celare artem has few disciples among them.
When it becomes necessary to attend to instruc-
tions, they twist their ears into funnels in their
anxiety to let no word escape them. Thisosten-
ta ious desire to appear effective is not in accord-
ance with the canons of true art. Had their ears
been stuffed with shavings and sealed with cob-
bler’B wax before they came on, there might have
been some reason for this evident desire to keep
mi courant with what was passing round them.
We throw this out as a mere suggestion. They
might suitor some Inconvenience at Arst from
these foreign bodies, but nothing that a cold chisel
and a sledge wouldn’t quickly remove. Among
them we recognised our old friend Smike, over
whose untimely end wo blubbered a generation
ago. He appears to be the same guileless, trusting
fellow we know out of Dickens’s page. A look of
beatitude lighted up his face as he placed his hand
in Maritana’s to have his fortune told. We couldn’t
bear what she said; but if she told him that there
are men whose physical comeliness At them for
driving a hearse, she wouldn’t have been far out.

Of the Marquis of Monteflore, Mr. Johnson
made a low comedy part with gay exits, but with-
out the leg of mutton in the distance. Miss Pen-
rose’s Marchioness was a marvel of well-seasoned
ugliness. AstheAlcade, Mr. Taylor jerked out the
few monosyllables he had to say in a voice which
was, no doubt, intended forsome useful purpose at
present inscrutable. Mr. Harley’s Captain of tho
Guard was a bit wooden, but, withal, satisfactory.
As Don Jose, Mr. Templeton created a sort of
neutral impression. Mr. Gordon's King of Spain
evoked no enthusiasm except a mild homicidal
spasm when he put on the gloves to knock the
stuffing out of the lower F (wo think). Some
thought him a stick; others, that the comparison
was rough on-him. One thing we can frankly
say-if late Spanish monarchs resembled him in
any way, the wonaer is why the crown jewels of
that favoured country haven’t been sold long ago,
and a Republic proclaimed.
• • •
As Lazarillo, Miss Lome made her first
appearance in Sydney. She had a good reception,
and deserved it. Her voice is a contralto of no
great power, but sweet, and of good range. For
her part In “ Turn on, old Time,” and “ Alas, those
chimes,” she received deserved applause, empha-
sized by a bouquet, which, by just missing M.
Caron, just missed bringing the entertainment to
a premature and melancholy close. A few inches
more to the right, and that talented musician
would now be sitting on a rainbow, tuning a
golden harp for a sempiternal overture. We have
no space to say much of Mr. Turner or Miss Mon-
tague. They have been heard too often in •* Marl-
tana ” to render much necessary, or even desirable.
Some of the high B Aats were left severely alone
by Charles, but, on the whole, his singing was very
effective throughout. Of the Gitana, we need
only say that when she was on the stage you could
have heard (for all the noise the audience made)
the prayer of a money-lender. When she was
going off, you couldn’t have heard a fog-horn.
Well done, Metropolitan Liedertafell Tho
seventh social concert of this society was un-
doubtedly the best they have yet given, taking it
all round. The Arst chorus, “ The Banners
Wave,” was rather uneven, but the “German
Serenade,” one of the sweetest things ever written,
was almost without a fault. It gave their new
tenor a chance of distinguishing himself; and, if
he had not persisted in calling out to his love
“Gooddo night,” instead of “Good night,” his
small sweet voice would not have been at all
amiss. But, where was Brown? It is time, how-
ever, that another tenor had an Innings at these
concerts: we were having just a little too much of
the same one. Mr. Hallewell will make the “ Val-
ley ” popular, if he goes on singing it as he did this
night. We don’t object to its becoming popular,
but we do hope we shall never hear It sung by a
played-out, husky, unmusical bass; Mr. Hallewell
has spoilt us lor that. We could very well have
dispensed with the duet between Messrs. Clancy
and West; but, as we had no say in the matter, we
had to sit and endure It. It was amusing to see
the eyes start out of tho heads of the audience,
and their mouths gape with wonder, when Mr.
Had cliff came on and Aute soloed. As there is
about one Aautiat to every hundred violinists,
people don’t quite understand what the Aute is
capable of. They hear an amateur tootle away in
a weak-lipped fashion, and then pronounce the
flute to be an ineffective instrument. So it is
little wonder that Mr. Radcliff’s playing was an eye-
(or, rather, an ear-) opener to hundreds there that
night. And what a mistake to suppose the violin
has more affinity to the human voice than any
other instrument! In a violin obligato to a song,
for Instance, the Instrument is always distinguisn-
able from the voice, while with a Aute it is almost
like a vocal duet. Of course we speak only after
heari ig Mr. Radcliff play a Aute obligato to
Madame Pauline Rita-Radcliff's singing. It may
be that there is not another pair in the world who
could trill at each other and with each other as
they do. The audience were determined to have
as much of them both as they could, so encored
everything they did with unbounded applause, and
rather thoughtless, persistence. Mrs. Peter Curtis
sang “The Kingdom Blest,” with nice expression
and a pleasant voice, for which she received an
encore. Boccherinis’ “ Miruetto” always Ands a
welcome from a Sydney audience, being, as it is,
one of those charming little morceaux. within the
comprehension of all. Herr Kretsohmann and
three gentlemen amateurs gave it on this occasion
as a string quartette. Of all their choruses, “The
Two Roses was the best, and if the Metropolitan
Liedertafel go on improving under the baton of
the genial Herr Hugo as they have done, why, the
Sydney Liedertafel had better look to their laurels
—that's all!

One of the novel features of the forth-
coming Hadclitf ballad concert will be a flute duet,
played for the first time in Sydney, by Mr. Radcliff
and a lady amateur.

There was no change at the Royal during
last week. “The Turn of the Tide” ran uninter-
ruptedly, and filled with the gloomiest forebodings
the few who pluckily sat it out. In the un-
tenananted murk the actors’ voices sounded hol-
low and funereal. Even Greville's inspired tom-
foolery touched no responsive chord, while the
praiseworthy efforts of the others were received
with stoney indifference. Mr. Goodman takes a
benefit to-night (Thursday).
A cruel joke has been played on a stranger
in a foreign land. We refer to our old friend
“ Captain,” the King-street aquatic oracle. Hays
“Captain,” in last week’s “notes “ The New
South Wales Rowing Association have arranged
the following matches for the Glebe Rowing Club:
—Intercolonial matches: January 31, Glebe a. City;
February 28, Glebe v- Balmain; April 25, Glebe v.
Union Recreation; May 30, Glebep. Rosehill. Pre-
sident’s Trophy: January 10. Glebe v. Rosehill;
February 14, Glebe t). Union Recreation; March 14,
Glebe v. Balmain; May 9, Glebe v City; June 12,
Globe v. Parramatta.” Can there be any limit to
the patience of a King street editor? We think
not, or “Captain ” would ere this have been rele-
gated to his old position on a raud-punt, the style
of craft on which, wo should say, “Captain" had
won his hard-earned title. But then, you know,
amateur pressmen are dear at any price.

that the German Emperor's recent accident was
not caused, as has been stated, by his horse tripping
over a wire, but that the old gentleman fell out of
his saddle in a faint, which, it was at first feared
by his suite, was something very like an apoplectic
tit. Of late ho has failed •visibly, and It is the
general opinion of his entourage that he might " go

PEPPER AND SALT.
Anyone who imagines that the Govern-
ments of Australia monopolise all the red tape and
official damphoollshness in this world, can at once
perceive by perusing the following item that they
are filling their heads with a high old mistake in-
deed. Only the other day, a sentry-post at the
Government offices in St- James’s Park was dis-
continued after 20 years of painfully active service.
It appears that during the year 1864, a military
Commission sat In a back building abutting on the
Park. In order to give a tone, as it were, to the
solemnity of the occasion, a member of the rank
and file was clapped at the entrahee, which was
thus held at the point of the bayonet from 10 til*
4 o’clock. The Commission accomplished its work
in a month or so ; the report was duly relegated to
the pigeon-holts of the Department, and all things
else cleared away, except the sentry-box. Two
decades passed, and still Tommy Atkins, with his
red coat, fixed bayonet, and his twenty years of
sentry go, paced up and down the brief parade
originally allotted to him. There was nothing to
guard, and he guarded it with the same watchful
eye that a cat would guard a rat-hole. Tommy
had, In point of fact, been quite forgotten, hut he
did bis “dooty,” and religiously drew bissalary for
his services.

“ By Jove, he Is a clever man;
I’ll tell you how I know it!
He said that by my prose he knew
That I must be a poet.”
The speaker was a fee-MAtn bard,
Who oft strives to awaken
The Muses, when his trade is slack
In butter, cheese, and bacon.
Up rose a rival rude and said,
With various needless curses,
“ He knew it from your prose-by Jove,
None know it from your verses.”

Certain people appear to hold strange
hotions as to what constitutes insanity. That
merry wag who took off his coat in a Lithgow
church, and offered to fight the priest, has even
been summed up as “Insane.” This is too droll—
squaring up to a divine is held to be proof of
insanity. Why, man’s natural instinct tempts him
to try the best of three rounds with a parson—or a
policeman. The promulgation of this new theory
jeopardizes the liberty of every good subject. A
fellow only requires to develop his instinct with
an extra “ go ” of whisky, and he stands an even
tnoney chahee of dying in a mad-house. We con-
fidently maintain the sanity of the Lithgow gen-
tleman.
Insanity’s a subject which is far beyond our ken—
A subject too abstruse for our solution;
Yet any brilliant notions which, at times, occur to
men,
Need only to be put In execution.
When certain silly “sobersides” are filled with
much amaze,
On “ proofs of madness ” greedily they fasten;
But where on earth’s the “ proof ” that any fellow
has a craze
Because he takes bis coat off to a parson ?
• * *
There seems every reason to believe tLat
the gentleman who has taken up the hangman's
billet in Victoria—vice Upjohn, resigned—is a
good all-round man. His vigour and precision, in
the flogging department are in nowise inferior
to his skill in the “ despatching ” line. When a
flagellating job is on, and the prison Governor
gives the stereotyped Instructions to this artist to
do his work to the “ best of his ability," he does it.
Poor Upjohn’s delivery had been getting very
feeble and uncertain during these latter days, but
the new man—Heaven be praised!—throws such
soul into his work that the “ screams of the pri-
soner ” (quoting the newspaper critique on a re-
cent performance) “ were heard all over the gaol.”
Such a tribute to his ability, coming, too, from
one who ought to know, must be highly gratify-
ing to the new functionary. Few other great art-
ists ever get such genuine applause.
One good point about our Metropolitan
Fire Brigades is that, even if they can’t put out
fires, they can always draw up a full and true
account of any little impromptu Illuminations
that chance to occur. We have before us now one
of these reports which is spread over about half an
acre of cream-laid paper, and which minutely
describes the time, place, and cause of a llare-up
which occurred in Oxford-street on the 31st ult.;
traces the pedigrees of the occupant and owner
bick to the rouseabout days of the Norman Con-
quest, states the number of the cabman who gave
the alarm, what he paid for his turn-out, the age
and brands of his horse, and, after giving about a
ton of other information of a like useful nature
winds up by observing that the whole damage
consisted in the cremation of about six feet of a
garden fence, and that the merciless ravages of the
fire-fiend were quickly checked by a member of the
police who filled his helmet with water and doused
the flames. It doesn’t appear that the Metropolitan
Fire Brigade ever got near the blaze at all, but the
splendid callgraphy of the report, and the exhaus-
tlve nature of the Information supplied, make
ample amends for such a trifling matter as non-
attendance on the battle-field.

Our own St. Petersburg correspondent,
who wears galvanised iron night-shirts, and sleeps
down the same cellar as the Czar, cables out to say
that a little incident happened at the Palace on
Monday last, which, for a few moments, threw the
whole place into the greatest alarm, and frightened
skillets of perspiration out of Air. Alexander Czar
in particular. From information received, it ap-
pears that a few lady friends had called at the
Palace, and were seated in the best parlour, wait-
ing to exchange chat with Her Imperial Highness,
and amongst the visitors was the young Prince
Ivan Vitchisvitch, aged 9, who amused himself, as
children of his years will at times, by blowing up
a paper bag which had previously contained a
pound or so of “taffy.” The bag being duly in-
flated, young Master Vitchisvitch tied the mouth
with his boot-lace, and, unnoticed by the visitors*
planted it very carefully on the chair which
was waiting to receive the lady Czar, Just, as he
afterwards rather irreverently explained, to “ see
the ol’ girl kick her bloomin’ socks off.” In a few
minutes after this, Her Most Majestic Majesty
sailed Into the room, smiled sweetly on all around,
remarked “ what lovely weather we’re having, now
that ‘ojus’ Krapotkine has been lumbered,” and
then flopped down in her chair like a sack of wet
guano. A terrific explosion immediately occurred
and with a frantic shriek which our correspondent
says will ring in his ears till the day of doom (or, if
showery then, till the day after), Mrs. Czar dashed
wildly down the back-yard and jumped into the
dust-bin, where her affrighted spous? Aleck was

friends at the bottom of the palace well. “ Jump-

‘‘what the crimson Hades is the matter with you
now?” ‘‘Matter enough,” groaned Mrs. Czar, as
she covered her head with a rotten cabbage;
“pickle my bloomin’ chignon if them dodgastod
Nihilists haven’t taken to stuffin’ their infernal

Nooze would observe, “ Our readers will perceive

The fashion in which the blessings of civili-
zation have been carried to the aborigines of these
colonies is still observable in Northern Queensland.
An ex-officer of the Native Police told us a lot of
queer yarns once. He was out on a “ dispersing ”
mission—about the only “ mission ” the blacks
have experience of—and he and his troopers came
upon a lot of blacks on the side of a steep ridge-
There was a lively scatter, and, by and bye, the
troopers returned on their tracks. Lying on the
hill-side was the corpse of a big bUckfellow, who
had been shot dead at the outset, and crouching In
the grass beside him was a little piccaninny about
four or five years old, crying bitterly, and shaking
the dead man’s head by its thick hair. The child
didn’t know why its father wouldn’t speak to it.
Ho was caught, and brought into camp by the
troopers to be civilized. After a while he was
quite reconciled to his lot, and, besides speaking
English, was able to sit a horse and go with the
troopers on their expeditions. On one of these, In
thesame neighbourhood, another “ dispersal ” was
in process, and the troopers were in hot pursuit
while Tommy remained bosida the Lieutenant,
who was watching the progress of affairs. A big
blackfellow crept out from behind a stump, and
was sneaking away down a broken gully when
Tommy’s sharp eyes caught sight of him. In-
stantly he raised his infant voice, “ Misser C —,
Misser C—, look out!” he screamed, beside him-
self with eager excitement lest the quarry should
escape. “ You shoot him that fellow I Him b
rogue! Him unde belonging to me! ”

Are you there, Mr. Sunday-school tract
editor ? If you are, catch on to this lot. Some
years ago, a certain well-known Victorian turfite
—a man of sin, who gambled and drank strong
drink, and carried on high-jinx in general- -was
Shear Madness.
“ CUT YER HAIR, BOSS ? WELL, I CAN PUT THROUGH MY SEVENTY A DAY IN ANY
SHED IN THE COLONIES, BUT THIS YBR’S NOO TO ME. I’M AFEAREO I’LL MAKE
A TOMAHAWKING JOB OF IT. ’OWEYER, I’LL TRY!"
"LOOK-AT ’ERE, NOW; THIS YER HATTITUDE BOTHERS ME. GIVE A MAN A FAIR
SHOW, AND ”
“ LET’S ’AYE THE POSITION SHEEP-SHAPE.”


Several of the London papers print as much
as two columns concerning the new N.Z. steamships
Arawa and Talnul—the former already alloat, the
latter on the stocks. They are each 420 feet long-,
of over 5000 tons gross, and have hulls on the
cellular-bottom plan, each vessel carrying 840 tons
of water ballast, by means of which a proper trim
and draught can be preserved throughout the
voyage as the coal is being burned out. Each is
full-rigged, and has accommodation tor 95 llrst-
class, 53 second-class, and 670 steerage passengers.
The refrigerating chambers can hold 700 tons of
meat, and the triple-expansion engines work at a
pressure of 160 lb. to the square inch, the highest
yet reached in ocean-going steamers.
The crushed Sir ’Enry once declared that
the East Sydney elections were carried by a flood
of Bibles and beer. It now appears that the same
spiritual combination is powerful enough to carry
the kingdom of heaven also, for recent home ad-
vices declare the rector in Hampton Lacy, War-
wickshire, England, bought the only tavern in the
village seven years ago, and hired a man to keep
it. From the sale of beer—no other drink being
sold—money enough has been made to pay the
salary of the church organist, and divide about
£30 among the local charities The beer sold is
guaranteed pure, and it is claimed as ene of the
results of the experiment that drunkenness is un-
known in the village. The last sentence seems a
bit of a crusher, because if the tangle won't make
a fellow drunk what in thunder’s the use of drink-
ing it? Providing our own stingo is supplied, a
similar plan, if carried out here, would not only
pay the church organist’s screw, but run the
whole of our religious organisations put together.
Religion seems to be in a “parlous” state when our
churches have to be partly built by the exposure
of female charms at Fancy Fayres and afterwards
kept alive by the sa'e of “ wollop.” However, Dr.
Barry might try the level-headed rector of Hamp-
ton’s plan with profit, for there’s a deal of good in
some things that are evil, after all.
engaged in a certain stable, but quitted that em-
ployment because he did not—to use a turfy phrase
—“comb the favourite’s tail” sufficiently. For-
tune was dead against him all through, until the
recent Cup carnival, when the fickle dame swung
found, and slflng hini a smile that netted him
fiombthiag better than a thousand ptiunds. And
now, Mr. Sunday-schodl Stiggins, what do you
think that lucky young fellow did with his pile f
Youf own charitable mind, which thlnkoth etil of
none, Will, of course, declare he gaffed it aWay in a
week’s tithe, or he got as tight as David’s sow and
was eased of the lot by a girl of “ promiscuous ”
virtue In a Chinese “ drum;” but you're clean out
of your reckoning this time, friend, for that honest
sport went round to the whole of his creditors,
paid every cent he owed, and, in addition, offered
a fair Interest for the time ho was forced to keep
his friends waiting for their money. And now,
Brother Stiggins, go thou and do likewise.

Gall for thedrummerl Well, we have to
smile when you talk of gall. Why, it was rank
“ plzun Cooktown snake-juice, prussic acid, and
Roseby’s unfermented wine all messed up together,
and stirred gently round with a stick of sulphur.
You see, it happened thusly. Bagman Halfton
and Bagman Scalds were on their way to strike a
new town for Christmas orders for the first time,
and, as a matter of course, their buggy prads had
to lay back their ears and Just hump themselves
proper, In order to see who could make the new
diggings first, and thus enable their owner to rope
the fattest customers. Drummer Scalds beat his
opponent by two hours, and, putting up at the
Royal—the only hotel in the place—was shown Into
the best apartments, and treated as it he were the
Shah of Persia with all his state-day “joolry” on.
When Drummer Halfton drove up, however, he—
being a mighty man on the roads—was Intensely
disgusted to find that the landlord, who was
smoking on the verandah, took no more notice of
him than If he were a sundowner on the wallaby,
or a common Justice of the Peace; but the bag-
man was taken down another peg when, on inti-
mating to his host that ho wished to put up there
for the day, that worthy coolly observed, “Well,
drive yer b team into tb’ yard, then, if y’ do.
Y’ don't want me t’ carry thim round on my back,
do you ?” “ Devilish Independent sort of district
this is,” muttered Halfton, as he drove down the
yard, unhitched his prads, and fed them in the
stable. On politely enquiring if he could be
obliged with soap and towel, &3, for awash, he
was still further crumpled up ou hearing the land-
lord call out to a kitchen slavey, “ Hey, Murier,
chuck this cove a bit o’ soap, an’ let him hev a
sloosh out there in th’ wash-house." The climax,
however, was reached when, on calling for his
dinner, gentleman Halfton was bundled Into a
room with the hotel servants, and told to tackle
some corned beef and cabbage. That was the last
straw that broke the drummer's back, and, clutch-
ing the astounded host by the throat, he roared,
Qorslamitt, what d’ye mean by thisd—dinsuiting
conduct? D’ye know who I am?” ‘‘Know who
you are ?” replied the other; “ yes, of course I do;
Mr. Scalds was here about two hours before you,
and he told me if his groom came along with a
buggy and pair, like you have done, I was t’ put
him up anywhere, and book th’ lott' him.” “Take
me into the bar,” exclaimed the crushed one;
‘‘soak my head under a tap, and let me taste of
your three-star, for I have an exceeding great pain
in the pericardial region.” The rival bagmen have
not met since; but when they do, the bombard-
ment of Foochow will only be as a Baptist picnic
by the side of the subsequent proceedings.
Commodore Et’sklne’s recent little bit of
plundering Is bearing fruit already “Prisoner
Johnson I" thundered one of our hired Solons to
an animated ragstaok behind the spikes on Thurs-
day week, “you are charged with having stolen four
ducks, two geeSe, and seven fowl§, the property of
Wdh Hop Sam—liow d’ye plead?” “Yer War-
sliup,” replied the dead-beat, “ thievin’ is wholly
agin my nachUr, an’ I couldn’t do it it I tried. I
never stole them fowls at all, but I see’d they wos
in danger of failin’ inter th’ hands ov an alien
race, an’ so I simply established a protectorate
over them till after Krlssmlss. I submits that this
wall-eyed, Jumbo-eared heathen, wid no heels on
his boots is ruled out o’ court.” “ Right,” said the
Solon, “ and you’re ruled into limbo for 14 days.”
And this is what is facetiously known as British
Justice.
• • m
J ustice always whirls in equal measure—
except, of course, on extraordinary occasions,
when It Is not desirable that she should coniine
herself to a strict attention to the whirling busi-
ness. One of these occasions seems to have oc-
curred at Goulburn, on the 29th ultimo, when
Mesac Thomas, Lord Bishop of Goulburn, toed the
Police Court scratch to answer to a charge of
putting on nasty “flash” by trotting his “ker-
ridge” round the street corners. John Boyd, in-
spector of nuisances, and Richard Sasse, a labourer,
distinctly swore they were standing at a spot
called Salvation Corner at 11 o’clock, and his lord-
ship turned the place at a swinging trot. Glancing
at the other side of the picture, we And that his
lordship Just as distinctly swore that he pulled up
and walked round the turning. Putting it mildly,
someone, at this stage of the proceedings, must
have committed pure, unadulterated perjury.
This, however, Is but a mere trifle compared to the
fact that, after hearing the evidence pro et con.,
the Police Magistrate blandly remarked that for
some reason or another the council was not repre-
sented by their solicitor, and a technical objection
arose through the inspector having failed to prove
the by-laws, but in this case they had a witness
proving a different offence, if any existed.
After which he carefully dismissed the case, and
My Lord Mesac left the court without the slightest
stain on his spotless character. Barely had his
lordship skipped, however, before a poor lay
devil, named William Lansdown, was charged with
trotting round another corner. Only one witness,
Inspector Boyd, swore to the trot, and the defen-
dant, in a clear, straight-forward manner, refuted
the charge in toto. “ For some reason or another,”
however, the counoil made no mistake this time,
and the P.M., after lucidly pointing out that the
Inspector had “ deposed to an offence being com-
mitted and the defendant did not disprove the
statement, therefore a penalty of 5s. and 4s. lOd.
costs would be inflicted.” This is the kind of thing
that makes us sick when our blatant windbags bob
up and prate of the sacredness of British Justice.
and, In face of cases like the above, it takes a heap
of talk to make any sane man believe there Is not
one law for the rich, and quite another—and a far
rougher one—for the “ beastly pooah.”

Quite a valuable addition to the collective
municipal wisdom of the colony has just been
made in a town up North, where the ranks of the
worthy aldermen have been materially increased
by the presence of a party who halls from the
resthetlo land of Llmburger cheese, lager beer, and
Bologna “sassidge.” This gentleman from Ger-
many, by the way, Is a sort of Teutonic Sir Boyle
Roche, and if he is only half as funny in the
Counoil as be is outside of it, no nigger Minstrel
crowd need fever hope to clear their eX’fl in that
town while a municipal meet 19 on. Alderman
Stoefel happens to be the proud possessor of a
small fai-nl, consisting of a cockatoo fence and a
sick hen, a miles oilt of town; and just by way
of preventing trduble with trespassers he has
chalked the following warning on his fence:—
“Notis.—Efry persons wanting to go through this
land will blease to go roundt itl” A few weeks
ago, an unregistered dog belonging to him was
shot, and the afflicted owner happening to come
along, and, seeing his canine pet with a neat little
bullet-hole drilled plumb through its forehead ex-
claimed : “ Gottsdonnerundblitzen I I vould fc
sooner hev find a poundt dan I lose dat dam dorg.
HerrJel budtltvas looky for Carlo dat plastidt
pullet didn’t go two Inches lower. Af it didt, it
vouldt hev ruined his eyesight for shure.” Mr,
Stoefel also runs a grocery, and it is related that
having got into a wordy war one day owing to a
customer wanting to pay twice over for the one
article, or some other aggravation of the sort, the
man from the Vaterland ordered the buyer to
hump himself off the premises altogether. And
on the party declining to move, the irate foreigner
roared, “Here, you gleares oudt ov mine shop
queek, or by tarn ov you don’t I pooty soon gets a
man that vlll. I hev none ov my tamdt nonsense
aboudt you.” This seems healthy for the favoured
municipality, and we are now gasping with anxiety
to read Herr Stoefel’s maiden speech on “dem
legal oessbits.”

This was one for his reverence’s nob, if you
like : A few days ago, a Qundagal squatter
trooped into a certain store just as a Southern
clergyman was debating wlta himself whether
he’d order a case of fine old port at 65s. a dozen, or
go in for a trunkful of nastier stuff at one-tenth of
the price—the said liquor, of course, being In-
tended for sacramental purposes only. Turning
to the squatter, the man of God asked what he had
bettor do. “ Do,” said the other; “ why, go in for
good stuff always, no matter what it costs you.’>
“ Ah, yes,” sighed his reverence, “ it’s mighty easy
for you to talk like that, because when the bill
comes in all you have to do is to shear your sheep
and pay it.” “ Exactly so," replied the wool klng>
‘‘but that’s precisely the spot where you have the
bulge on me, for, while I can only lift one clip a
year, you can shear your flock every Sunday.”
After which the man of God began to tell a yarn
about an uncle of his that had a “ bull-tarrier
purp” that could crack cocoa-nuts with his back
teeth, and eventually the conversation settled
down into a more satisfactory and agreeable level
for all the speakers.

Up to the present time, want of Dfflce
accommodation and the excessively high price
charged for Scotch pies prevented the Nooze
from being able to contradict one half their tele-
graphic matter in the same issue as it appeared,
but, now that Alfred is safely located in the new
“ primlsis,” and luncheon arrangements have been
completed with the “ Flying Scud ” hash-house
round the corner, he hopes to be in a position to
enable him to contradict the whole of his veraciou 8
news at least a day before it is published. One
anecdote will suffice to show the necessity
of this. A few days ago a certain land auctioneer,
who hates lying worse than a Rum reporter hates
soap, was told by a PItt-street lawyer that Ezekiel
Baker had just been elected for Carcoar. “Are
you sure that’s true?” enquired the truth-loving
saleman. “ True ?” exclaimed the other, “ why,
it’s in the Even Nooze.” “ Umph!” grunted the
other; “then I’d lay a roast turkey to a shin o’
beef the thing's a He.” Next day the two met
again at luncheon, and the limb of the law exult-
ingly shouted: “Ah, ahl Mr. Golng-going-gone,
y’ see I was right, Ezekiel—Baker was elected,
after all.” “Well, if it was true,” replied the dis-
gusted auctioneer, “ what th’ devil did they want
t put it in the Even Nooze for ?” No one present
seemed to know, and so the conversation ended,

All barbers are essentially sporting cusses,
but the chin-raspers of Melbourne are in this
respect a touch above all their brethren this side
of the equinoctial line. And a few of the sporting
tonsorial artists also love a beer at times. In point
of fact, it is said that a barber has six excuses for
drinking—viz., the visit of a customer, the absence
of a customer, thirst existing, thirst to come, the
goodness of the ;wna or any other excuse their
fertile mind can tktok of. However, Malua won
the Cup, and on the morning after the flutter a
Sydney legislator calleldN'n to the lather emporium
of a man who on the prewrfous day held the son of
St. Albans for a century. Being a cool hand, th e
man from Sydney, making all allowance for the
festivity of the times, didn’t in the least mind the
tonsorial artist tying the Arqus round his neck,
giving him a towel to read, and then rather jerkl-
tavily enquiring “Doutcher fine sh’lubrlty’f ash-
musphere increash ash fo’ great plantesh ’proaoh
er pcrrer-heel-yun ?” Neither was the visitor very
much alarmed when the professor shoved the
shaving-brush in his mouth and began to lather
his face with the lighted end of a cigar; but when
the lucky backer of Malua grabbed hold of a razor
and commenced crawling up on the back of his
customer's chair, In order, as he explained, to get
out of the reach of the pink-headed goanners that
were swarming about and spitting sulphur squirts
all round the floor, the patient gave one dart out
of the chair, and then lit out of that shop in some-
thing less than one-tenth of the time the Cup was
won in. He could stand a great deal from a barber,
but he drew the line at “ Goanners.”

Miss Blsie Stanley-Hall.
Elsie Maude Stanley-Hall, whose por-
trait adorns our front page, and who is
better known as little Elsie, was born in
Toowoomba (Queensland) on June 22, 1877,
so that she is not yet half-past seven. From
earliest infancy she showed a marvellous
aptitude for music, spelling out on the piano,
even before she could walk, her tirst little
melody, “Nelly Bly.” On her second birth-
day she played at a little tea-party the
melodies of “Home, Sweet Home,” “Nelly
Bly,” and “Happy Band”—little tunes
which her mother had frequently used as
lullabies. Before she had attained the
dignity of three years, she played “Rous-
seau’s Dream,” whilst a quartette sang the
melody and parts. She rapidly increased her
repertoire, playing everything she h»s»rd
wnich took her fancy, but not receiving a* y
instruction until she was five years of age,
when her mother commenced giving her
regular lessons. In July, 1883, the child was
placed under the care of the talented and
popular pianist, Madame Charbonnet-Keller-
mann, who finds in this gifted little thing
the promise of a splendid musical future.
Indeed she is Madame’s very own pupil, as
can be seen by her already partially-formed
style. A few weeks ago, the child was out
spending a musical evening, and upon a lady
being asked to sing, the baby, much to
everybody’s astonishment, volunteered to
act as accompanist. The company smiled
dubiously, but there was no hesitation in the
firm littie footstep as she marched across
the room and took her place «t the piano.
As soon as the tiny fingers started the sym-
phony, everybody was convinced that they
well knew what they were about; and the
song was accompanied in a manner which
was truly marvellous, the voice being fol-
lowed with a tact so often lacking in the
majority of accompanists. And tuis was
done at sight; indeed, her reading at sight
is wonderful. She is small for her age, and
has a bright, intelligent face. The portrait
is taken from a splendid photograph from
the studio of Mr. .1. A. Newman of Oxford-
street.


Messrs. Cameron, Bros., and Co.’s Mam-
moth Tobacco Factory.
Many years ago, the senior partner of Messrs.
Cameron, Bros., and Co. visited Australia in order
that he might personally study the tastes and re-
quirements of the tobacco consumers of this
country, with a view of further extending, by
more judicious catering, the then growing busi-
ness with his firm’s large Virginia factories; and
although the result of his visit associated the
name of Cameron with the best brands of tobacco
throughout the Australian world, the Cameron
Brothers’ energy did not cease with this achieve-
ment of success. In 1873 they determined to trans-
plant a portion of their labour and capital from
Virginia, and invest the same among the people
■who for so many years previous patronised their
industry. And the subject of our to-day s sketch
is the result of their efforts in New South Wales.
This great factory, employing oyer 300 workmen,
now distributes its famous brands throughout the
length and breadth of New South Wales; and,
were it not for our Intercolonial blockade lines,
our sister colonies would to a large extent enjoy
the benefit of its productions. Highly glowing
accounts are frequently given of industries be-
vond the limits of New South Wales, and seldom
do the public hear of the manufactures of our
colony that deserve more than a passing notice.
The Industry now under review furnishes a tell-
ing evidence of the strides this colony is making
in its manufacturing. One of Nature s greatest
boons to man is its tobacco. Wits have built their
brightest reputations upon Its pleasures, while
even the sober philosopher or historian has not
hesitated to unburden his sobriety and drop the
gravity of his pen under the genial Influence of
the pipe. The manufactory of Messrs. Cameron
Bros, and Co. is replete with all the latest ap-
pliances for the manipulation of the raw material,
and, in its entirety, shows wonderfully accurate
powers of genius and a knowledge of combined
skill only to be gained by much experience and a
long extended series of careful and costly experi-
ments highly creditable to the manufacturers.
The entire process is one of the most ingenious
and interesting to be seen in any part of the
world. It has been chiefly by watching the finer
points in manufacturing, allied to keen foresight
and enterprise, that they have gained their present
foothold. The capital required in working this
business is enormous. The number of hands em-
ployed necessitates an outlay in the matter of
wages alone of many hundreds per week. That
their labours here have been most liberally re-
warded and appreciated is proven by the universal
public patronage extended to them, and it only re
mains in this place to give a areneral Idea of the
manufacturing process. The first object to attract
the visitor’s attention on entering the imposing
building at Liverpool and Pitt streets will be the
commodious offices and spacious sample rooms
adjoining. The other portions of the ground tioor
being taken up with the engineers’ departments,
containing a 30 h.p. emrlne and three large Cornish
boilers, and a box factory replete with every ap-
pliance for making the various boxes in which the
tobacco is finally packed. To give in detail a full
description of the various departments would
necessitate more space than we have at disposal.
Suffice it to mention that the Virginia leaf and
strip tobacco (which, by the way, comes not from
agents, but is supplied by their head establishments
in Virginia) is imported packed in hogsheads, hav-
ing been thoroughly cured in their Virginia fac-
tories. The tobacco, on arrival at the Sydney
house, is taken to the sorting-room and moistened,
then carefully classified; after which the leaf is
is sent into the “Stemmery,” where it is divested
of its stem or stalk, thence into another depart-
ment, the “ Casing-room,” to receive its flavour-
ing. After this treatment, the tobacco is placed
upon swinging air-dryers to remove all fermenting
tendencies, and prepare it for the next process of
humouring,” allot which operations require the
careful superintendance of practised hands and
managers who have served long apprenticeships
to the business in their Virginia factories. Recog-
nising as they do that improved machinery and
improved processes and treatment enhance the
quality of the product, the firm has supplied its
factories throughout with the most approved
appliances and methods of treatment. After the
tobacco has been subjected to a satisfactory
“ ordering ” test, the portion intended and pre-
pared for Negrohead and Twists is sent into the
Twist-room. Here is a small army of men, and
the rapidity and deftness of the workmen at this
employment are really surprising. The remaining
portion prepared for “lump” and “fancies” is
sent into the Lump-room, where a large number
of girls are busily engaged at rows of benches
in the exercise of cleverly manipulating the plant
into various and innumerable styles, weights,
and sizes of “ figs ” and “ plugs ” known as “ Caven-
dish ” and “ Aromatics.” After having undergone
the above processes, which are completed chiefly
by hand-work, the twists, lumps, and fancies are
packed in large drawing boxes and sent into the
press-room. Here commences the mechanical part
I of the process. This room is filled with hydraulic
* presses of all sizes and shapes, with pressing capa-
city ranging from 100 tons to 3000 tons; hand-screws
of various sizes and designs, iron-preparers, iron-
finishers wi+h their companion carriages innumer-
able, bewildering masses of belts, pulleys, scales,
hydraulic pumps of various patterns, and other
implements required to perfect the work meet the
eye at every turn, while the whirl of machinery
tends to confuse the visitor. In this department
the various styles and grades of tobacco are sub-
jected to such varied and intricate treatment that
anything like a lucid description of same is beyond
our power, as is the whole of this great com-
bination of skill, judgment, and mechanism,
from the “sorting” department (where the large
piles of raw material in initial stages of pre-
paration present the appearance of enormous ant-
hills) to the foreman’s table in the press-room,
where the beautiful and symmetrically finished
tobacco is being “ tagged’’—that is, each "fig”
and “plug ” receiving a small “enamelled” paper
or tin symbol and name of the brand under which
it is sold. There have been so many imitations of
Messrs. C. B. and Co.’s productions, that they find
it necessary to adopt this means of protecting
themselves and the public against deception. The
whole, including the artistic stenciling and label-
ing of the boxes, must be seen to be appreciated;
and the firm, unlike most other manufacturers, do
not profess to have any secrets about their manu-
factory, and always gladly welcome with Vir-
ginian courtesy any visitor who is sufficiently
interested in the industry to look over their estab-
lishment. The excellence of their tobaccos is
chiefly attributed to their long experience in the
business, and the unceasing care ; they take from
the selection of the best crops of leaf to the box-
ing of the manufactured article. Since 1843, this
I firm has been manufacturing especially for tb*
Australian trade,,

Something for Parents to Think Over.
We feel it our duty to write you what the Ctm-
cuba Remedies have done for our little boy, who
has been terribly afflicted with salt rheum, scro-
fula, and erysipelas ever since he was born, and
nothing we could give him helped him until we
tried Cuticura, which, after using quite a
quantity, began to help and gradually cured him,
until he is now as fair as any child. His body waa
completely covered, and his face and hands swelled
very badly. We had no comfort with him; it was
so much work to take care of him, and he suffered
so. We began to treat him when he was 18 months
old, giving him at first 10 drops of the Cuticura
Resolvent at a time, bathing in hot water and
Cuticura Soap, and applying Cuticura carefully
to the entire body. He is now years old, and is
perfectly well. We have not written before be-
cause we thought It might appear again; but it
has not, and we are very thankful. MR. and MRS#

At Melbourne, on Saturday last, the prin-
cipal event at the bicycle snorts held in connection
with the Melbourne Sports Depot, the three-mile
handicap, fell an easy victory to F. H. Shackleford
(35 yards), with. H. 0. Bagot (330 yards) second. F.

pyramids, even, for the same stako.
Arthur Hancock, the crack English walker,
duly arrived in Australia by the John Elder, and

We have received a copy of the “New
South Wales Sporting Annual,” edited by Mr. H. P.
Gilbert. The little volume, published at Is. 0d.,
gives a review and statistics for the past season on
cricket, football, aquatics, lacrosse, bicycling, and
athletics, and should prove of Interest to all classes
of amateur athletes.
At Wellington, N.Z., on 17th November,
Pettongeil and Perry fought with soft gloves for
£100, at the Theatre Royal. Pettengell took the
lead from the llrst round, and finished the fourth
and the fight with a right-hander on Perry’s jaw.
Pettengell weighed list. 81b., and stood 5ft. S&in.,
while Perry weighed list. 41b., and stood 5ft. Tin.
A match between the Carlingford and
University Clubs was commenced on the Associa-
tion around on Saturday last, when the’Varsity
eleven held the wicket the whole afternoon, and
put together 359 runs. Ten out of the eleven bats-
men ran into double figures, Pope taking the cake
with a well compiled 118. The match will be con-
cluded next Saturday.
The only bit of startling news anent the
Boach-cum-Hanlan-cum-Clifford matches, we clip
from the Rum; —"The Dapto people are confident
Beach will win the double.” A crusher this for
Hanlan and Clifford I By the way, the "Alien”
sort of gave himself away—or rather his paner—
when ho snapped so greedily at the tempting little
bait we laid. But there’s no accounting for the
vagaries of a new chum.
The luckiest man on the turf is Mr. Ham-
mond, the English owner who by St. Gatlen’s
success in the Cesarewitch pocketed between
£00,000 and £80.000, and who by Florence’s win in
the Cambridgeshire robbed the “ bookies ” of
£35,000. This year he has run a dead heat for the
Derby, and won the Manchester Cup, the Ascot
Gold Vase, the Baden Baden Grand Prize, and
many other less important events.
At the recent Christchurch (N.Z.) meeting
the large sum of £31,567 passed through the Total-
isator. On the first day the amount was £8653;
second day, £11,433 ; third day, £11,493. And
amongst the dividends were sueh plums as £7010s.,
£54 13s. 6d.. £54 9s., £4313s., £16 17s. 6d.. and £13 7s.
6d.—each for the investment of £1. We should
very much like the pleasure of giving the Totalisa-
tor a hearty welcome into New South Wales
In a game of pyramids between the Eng-
lish bllliardists, D Richards and W. J. Peall, the
former fairly out-did himself, and his performance
must certainly rank as the most extraordinary
ever witnessed in the game, as he won four games
right off without his opponent taking a ball.
Richards won the first by 9 to love (break of 9), the
second 11 to love (break of 10), the third by 9 to
owes 1 (break of 9), and the fourth by 11 to love
(break of 11).
A London sporting writer has had “a pri-
vate letter from Sydney,” in which he says: “ I
gather that Hanlan was frightened out of his race
with Beach. He had a severe nervous shook.
After narrowly escaping being run down by one
of the heavy lumbering steamers that followed
the race, he for the moment collapsed, and when
he partially recovered himself, and got away on
his boat, it was too late. He will make an exhibi-
tion of Beach the next time they meet.”

Jti rc the dispute in Melbourne between
Matterson and Edwards with regard to the course
rowed on the Albert Park Lake, on 5th November.
Edwards rowed over the course on the 29th, and
the stakes were duly handed over to him. It was
not to be_ expected that Matterson would take a
second trip to Victoria after fairly winning the
prize in the Arstinstance: and as to Edwards offer-
ing to add money, and make a regular match of it.
he must have had a shrewd idea that the Clarence
Klver lad would not accept, or he would not have
been quite so anxious to shovel any more doubloons
into Matterson s pocket. We wonder if Bobby
blushed when the prize was handed over to him.
The all-comers’ race in connection with
the recent Balmain regatta was re-rowed on
Saturday last, when Pearce made an easy win
Messenger second, and Matterson third. Matter-
son must be stale after going through such an
amount of training, and, if he has any idea of
carrying out the rather premature prophecies
made by the sporting Press with respect to his
future career In a shell, we would advise him to
take a lengthened period of rest. Not that we
think his staleness had anything to do with the re-
sult on Saturday last, for, leaving the rough
water out of the question, there cannot be much
doubt be is not yet up to Pearce’s calibre, given
the Double Bay man is in anything like condition.
Says London Bell’s Life:—“Among the
recent visitors to London is Mr. Harrison, of Vic-
toria, who in the colonies is termed the “ father of
the Victorian game.” This gentleman is leaving
no stone unturned to have the laws of the Rugby,
Association, and Victorian games assimilated, so
that, as in cricket, one universal code would be
used in all parts of the globe. Our knowledge of
the Australian game is slight. We cannot, how-
ever, fail to perceive that it contains many good
points. Notwithstanding this, we fear Mr, Harri-
son, is engaged on an almost hopeless task, when
he endeavours to persuade the ruling powers of
two such time-honoured Institutions as the Rugby
Union and the Football Association to abandon
their popular rules in favour of a comparatively
new code.”
W. G. George, the champion English
amateur, failed, on Oct. 17, in his attempt to beat
Deerfoot’s alleged record of 11 miles 970 yards.
George went off at a capital pace, covering his
Arst mile in train. 50 2-5sec., but, as he thought that
he lost upon the last occasion through miking too
much use of his powers at the outset, he steadied
down after this, hisjsecond mile occupying 5mln
12seo. The next three were reeled off with mar-
vellous regularity, the third occupying 5min. 10
3-5sec., and the fourth and Afth 5min. lOsec. ex-
actly. After this ho gradually got slower, the
miles occupying 5mln. 13 3-5see„ 5min. 17 l-5seo,,
5mln. 18 3-5sec., and 5mln. 33 l-5sec. respectively;
and, after nine miles had been run In 46mln. 48
2-5 sec., he found he was so far behind his previous
record that he thought it was useless to persevere,
and after running another furlong he stopped.
The Glebe Rowing Club people have been
working like niggers to bring their annual regatta
—which eventuates next Saturday—up to the
usual standard. The entries were too numerous
to allow of all the competitors starting on the
eventful day, and heats innumerable have been
rowed off during the past couple of weeks. On
Saturday last, for the maiden double-sculls, J. Cox
and M’Gregoi defeated G. Macready and P. Icker-
son; and, for the trial fours, E. Boyle, Beegling.
Fairweather, and H. Cox won the Arst heat;
the second heat fell to the boat manned by
W. Wilson, Curnow, A Ickerson, and F. Williams-
and M’Diarmid, Doutty, Robertson, and Farron
proved the best men in the third heat. For next
Saturday afternoon, the Quondong has been en-
gaged for Aagship, and a smaller boat will follow
the races, to carry the umpire and ship as many
more as feel inclined to part a modest “robert”
forth© luxury. Soft stuff will be on tap for the
softer half, and—beud low. gentle reader, lest the
Rum man should bo prowliug around—something
harder will be on hand for the stern remainder.
The Gardiner Cup race in connection with
the New South Wales Rowing Association, to come
off on December 20, promises to be a Arst-class—
procession, with the Sydneyites to the fore. There
must be a screw loose amongst our amateur oars-
men when only a Sydney Rowing Club crew—
Messrs. Moppett, J. B. H. Kennedy, Brodie, and
C. A. Bros, and a so-called North Shore, but actually
a Sydney-citm-North Shore crew, Messrs. Hart,
Creswell, Bourke, and Thomson—enter for such a
trophy. While a powerful club like the Mercan-
tile continues at loggerheads with the Rowing
Association, affairs cannot be expected to take a
change for the better, and, as there seems no show
of the old feud being healed up, we would strongly
advocate—in the Interests of amateur rowing—
that the Rowing Association, a body which It must
be confessed has never proved a success, be
knocked on the head and a new association formed
under an entirely different constitution. Without
going into the right or wrong of the action taken
by the Mercantlles with regard to the Association,
it is very certain that, so long as the club stands
out of events rowed under the auspices of thie
Association, so long will they be shorn of interest,
except to the oarsmen who adorn their sideboards
with pots won by mere “walkovers.”
The Balmain regatta committee, by rea-
son of their vacillating In the matter of awarding
the 24-footers' prize at their recent regatta, have
added another nail to the coin n of the fast-expiring
sport of open-boat racing. The Victor was on
her wrong leg when she threw the Dreamland up
into the wind, and should have been disqualiAed;
but, as the committee did not take such action,
Mr. Creagh is, without doubt, entitled to the prize,
for If his non-observance of the rule of the road
was not of sufficient moment to merit disqualiAca-
tion, It seemed pretty rough on him to order tne
race to be sailed over again, more especially as
the amateurs who competed against him acknow-
ledged the sailing did not affect the result of th
race. The bungle of the umpire in deciding to
have the race re-sailed only led further into the
mire. The Dreamland and Lottie, putin an appear-
ance on Saturday last, but they were not started,
and up to the time of our going to press, we had not
heard bow the Balmainiacs intended to wriggle
out of the difficulty. That Mr. Creagh will even-
tually come out on the right side of the squabble,
there cannot be two opinions; and we think the
Balmain committee will show a little of the sense
they have gone to such trouble to show they are
wanting In, if they put a good lace on the matter,
and hand Mr. Creagh his prize.
A commercial depression has set in in
England. One-sixth of the Lancashire looms have
Stopped work, and out of 44 spinning companies
which took stock during September, 39 were un-
ah|® to declare any dividend. A Tory paper says:
Even those who are so fortunate as to be at
work have to be content with starvation wages,
a yd we do not hesitate to affirm that the amount
of human misery now existing in Lancashire has
never been equalled since the time of the Ameri-
can civil war. In the iron trade, the following
figures express the condition of affairs: 1881, 553
furnaces ; 1883, 565; 1883, 510; September, 1884,
tu ’ Agriculture fares no better. After one of
the finest harvests known, pigs are actually being
9? wheat; that is found to pay better than to
sell the grain at a loss of 8s. or 10s. a quarter.”
Jrhus while hundreds of thousands of English men,
women, and children lack bread, pigs are being fed
on wheat. This is the fruit of social arrange-
ments, which we are told it is wicked and stupid
to desire to change. It pays better to feed pigs
than the poor! Does it ? What would God say ?
A couple of Greeks who had found, while
ploughing in their own country, two very old
statues, and had surreptitiously brought them to
England for sale, were arrested the other day
while trying to sell the statues at Stepney, whither
they had ‘hawked” them In a four-wheeled cab.
Just think of it! The statues of Ares (the god of
War) and Aphrodite (the goddess of Love) carted
19 a conveyance like that which meets our
North Shore ferry-boat I It is well for these two
impious Greeks tnat Pan has been dead for many
. n old times, when there was nectar
still on draught on Olympus, and Arcadian nymphs
played hide-and-seek with mortals in the groves,
such conduct would have met with prompt and
Ingenious retribution. The thieves would have
been turned into magpies or foxes, metamorphosed
into vegetables, or sent mad. Gadflies would have
pursued them up and down the earth; the Pates
would have been at their heels, whipping them on
through a desperate series of afflictions, until they
sought headlong death off some Ionian cliff or
were transmogrified into porpoises or sea-gulls by
some compassionate divinity. Be the decision of
the London police-court what it may, the culprits
may rest assured that “ the beak ” will be more
lenient than Zeus or Here, Ares, Athene, or Aphro-
dite would have been. As it is, his Worship has
only taken slight ball for them, and remanded
them. Once upon a time, for the same offence,
they would have been turned, straight out of hand,
into bats, or toadstools, or grasshoppers. Both
Ares and his companion in degradation, the lovely
Paphlan Queen, were of a specially vindictive
character. They punished at once, and never for-
gave. Together Mars and Venus always were, in
mythology and out of it, and now in this prosaic age
we find them still, side by side.lu the police-court.
The circumstances of such companionship are
scarcely dignified, but who could tell when they
were laid i n their marble coffin in Athenian soil
that the day would come when the plough would
discover them, and that they would start together
upon such a journey, ending in such a place ? The
fanes of Cytherea, no doubt, are desolate. Cyprus
and Paphos know her worship no more. The
groves of myrtle and rose are wildernesses, and
men have forgotten that the poppy and the apple
are consecrated to her. The sparrows have thrown
off their allegiance, and the swans, too; while, bred
for the use of gun-olubs, the dove has lost all its
sanctity. Yet, let this be as It may, she is Jdalian
Aphrodite still, the omnipotent Mother of Love,
and it is an Intolerable outrage upon the most
beautiful of traditions that her effigy should be
ignominlously plundered and subjected to such
gross experiences as a four-wheeler and a police-
station. For very much less than this the goddess
would, In the old days, have metamorphosed a
whole parish into bears, or stricken a province
with pestilence. Ever since the two Greek gentle-
men found the statues they seem to have had a
bad time of it. Afraid to Enow their precious but
ponderous treasure-trove, they have been con-
demned by an inexorable destiny to drag the
guilty bulk about with them from Greece to the
Levant and from tho Levant to England. For
falling in that respect which was the due of the
gods whom they found, they have thrown away
the labour of months, have lost their expenditure,
and fallen eventually upon evil days as offenders
against the law. Thus, though Ares and Aphro-
dite have no temples now, it would seem as it they
had not altogether surrendered their claims to
deference or forgotten how to punish impious
men.
The Times, under its new editor, Mr.
Buckle, a gentleman 30 years of age, has appar-
ently turned Radical. So has London Punch. Our
London correspondent sends us the above. We
have not any confirmatory extracts from the
Times, but, by a coincidence, a friend in these
colonies sent us simultaneously a marked Punch,
which confirms the assertion of our London con-
tributor. Conceive the alteration in public opi-
nion which permits Punch, so many years a mere
jester for the wealthy classes, to print anything
like this:—

A faithful drudge, his ageing limbs exposed
To Summer’s heat, to Winter s wet and cold;
Now his half century of use is closed,
His cramp-racked limbs at length are weak and
slow.
O’er his task the old man lagged and dozed,
Espied by Pugson. Labour’s field is large.
And Mattock’s fate is—summary discharge!
Why not ? Must economic law give place
To Mattock’s special need ? Forbid it, Sage!
The work-worn clod has run his weary race,
Has spent his manhood's strength for scanty
wage.
Cold Trade ignores the soft superfluous grace
Of sympathy for broken health or age.
What lies before its grey toil-shattered slave ?
Poverty’s dole, the Workhouse and the Grave.
Such long-drawn labour swells the gathering
gain
Which makes his masters pillars of the Trade,
Town notables, whose skill and force of brain
Wake platform panegyrics. Scribes upbraid
The banded Craftsmen who, their strength made
plain,
Stretch it till Capital shrinks, sore afraid:
Labour unphalanxed at their feet must cower
Whoso tyranny taught it the abuse of power.
’Neath Pugson’s sway intelligence is chilled
And independence crushed; no human grace
Llghten’s subjection, labours laugh is stilled,
And skill unslavlsh wears a sullen face.
Like some dull creek by sluggish waters filled
And emptied tide by tide, the grim grey place
At morn and night whilst garish gaslights gleam,
Absorbs and voids a joyless human stream.
Not all are Pugson’s truly, and not all
Labour’s great Captains churls austere and
mean;
But Labour knows how oft the tolling thrall
Is slave to Greed, that wolf though gorged still
lean,
And still voracious! Enterprise they call
The hungry thing that has the art to glean
From herded harried thousands tithe and toll,
Squeezed from starved body and from stunted
soul.”
Or like this:—" On Friday last the Prince of Wales
E resided at a meeting held in the Guildhall to cele-
rate the Jubilee of the Abolition of Slavery in
the British Colonies. And fifty years hence they
will probably be celebrating the abolition of some-
thing which is considered to-day (as Slavery was
1 then) a buttress of Commerce and a Prop of the
State. Yertmm gap, /”

Skierniwice, September 16th.—Last even-
ing the Czar and Czarina gave a small and select
dinner. Precisely at 7.30 two cabs drew up at the
d°9 r r2f,J , Palace, and Francis Joseph of Austria
and Wilhelm of Germany entered the portals, and,
after hanging their crowns on the hat-rack and
depositing their sceptres in the corner of the hall,
took a glance in the mirror preparatory to enter-
ing the drawing-room. “ Wilhelm,” said Francis,
nervously, “is my cravat climbing up the back of
my collar ?” “ No; it’s all right,” replied the Ger-
man Emperor. “My hair all smooth? Wonder
who we’re to take In?” “Give It up. Come
along, we’re late.” After a famished Interval of
fifteen minutes, during which the hot weather
was the chief topic of conversation, dinner
was announced. The Czarina rose. “ Your
Imperial Highness,” she said graciously, “will
you dine a mite?” After the Czar bad
been enticed out from under the sofa, the
Austrian Monarch had been coaxed from behind a
book-case, and Wilhelm had been revived, the
Czarina apologised for her lapsus linguae, and the
party entered the dining-room. “ Came within an
ace of fainting, didn’t I ? ’ remarked the German
Emperor, and a royal flush o’erspread his pallid
countenance. “Yes,” replied the Czarina. “For
a moment it was three kings and an acc—almost a
full hand for me. How are the people of Germany
at present ?” “ Oh, they’re assassination,” gloomily
answered Wilhelm, as he eyed the waiters with
suspicion. The Imperial Soup-taster then pro-
ceeded to sample the consomme, and their High-
nesses, before taking any, waited patiently to see
whether he would fall dead or turn green, while
nothing disturbed the convivial silence, save the
measured tread of the sentinel in the pantry and
the smothered ticking of the Infernal machine that
was concealed in the mashed potatoes.

The hot weather has come at last. It’s hot
everywhere, and the only way to keep at anything
under 100’ in the shade, is to adopt the suggestion
of the late Sydney Smith, cleric and wit, to slip out
of your skin and sit in your bones. An overcoat
is not now an absolute necessity, and the thinner
the shirt the cooler the man. It touches up every-
one, does this hot weather. It sours some people’s
tempers, it disarranges the livers of others, and
it brings out an epidemic of angry correspond-
ence in tne papers on that fruitful grievance,
the Water Supply. As we have said, it’s
hot everywhere —the wind is generally hot,
and the water is almost simmering in the pipes.
It’s hot in the theatre, it’s hot in the streets, it’s
hot in the houses; in fact, the hot season has de-
liberately set in. There is only one place within
our knowledge where it is cool, and the thought
of it creates a delicious sensation of iciness all
over us; and that place is the beautiful, cool, airy,
well-ventilated warehouses of Anthony Hordern
and Sons, Palace Emporium, Haymarket.*

SOCIAL
The Baptists held a most sedate bazaar in
the Newtown Town Hall. The shyest young man
could go safely in. Matrons without the jeast
flippancy would Introduce cosies and cushions to
his notice; and even Miss Holers, who was the
most enterprising of single girls, and wore a cocoa-
coloured dress, was as demure as she was dainty.
There were some eight or ten stalls, on which the
heterogeneous articles usually seen at bazaars
were spread—very much spread, for tho stock was
limited. Mrs. Davies was assiduous in wwrkinv up
members for a large blue doll, so lifelike that no
married man could have taken it home without
first explaining how he got it. Natty decorations
were spread about the hall, and a refreshment
table was quite a favourite place under the allur-
ing management of several modest maidens.

Dr. A. H. Nash, the handsome homooopath-
1st, was married the other day at South Brisbane
to Miss Ida J. Pietzeker. second daughter of Mr.
A. R. H. Pietzeker, J.P., of Ercildean, in that
locality. The wedding was a pretty one—the bride,
of course, in white, and her four maids in cream
veiling with heliotrope ribbons; and quite a num-
ber of visitors went to church to witness the
genial doctor being made happy. The event will
be a rude shook to a number of nice Sydney girls.
Breakfast was held at Mrs. Pietzeker’s residence,
and a lew days ago Mr. and Mrs. Nash went
through from Sydney to Melbourne to complete
their honeymoon.

The closing ball of the Albert Quadrille
Assembly at Leichhardt seems to have been an
important event, for a large number of the Mite
gathered round the door. These spectators
favoured the guests as they arrived with various
expressions, of approval or otherwise, as to f heir
attire. Youths garbed in the unpretending but
useful gre* tweed were looked on with silent
respect. Hamlet, Hannibal, the Mahdi, and other
celebrities were warmly received; while ladies
fixed up as Boadicea or Joan of Arc received out-
bursts of delight. Tho Albert Hall is a line one,
with every convenience, and Mrs. Crawshaw, of
Day-street, catered refreshments in tho largo back
room. A string band played on the stage, and the
usual two dozen dances were finished soon after
four. During tho evening, some atrocious hyena
outside disseminated the odour of a dead dog
through the open windows. Some active young
men started out to enquire after his health, but
he had left. Had they found the humorous
animal, he would probably have filled a respon-
sible part in an inquest. Except this little
Incident, “ nothing occurred to mar the harmony
of tho proceedings.” There was a very close con-
test for beau of the ball Charles II. was gor-
geous, but small for a King, and his legs were
almost derisively delicate. His rival, Don Clear,
or Don Juan, or something, whose first entry was
greeted with general acclamation, was more sub-
stantial; but new boots gave him an air of stiff-
ness, and he did not possess the same perennial
smile that Charles wore. Each of these young
gentlemen fetched his heart’s idol with him. and
the ladies, too, were serious rivals. One was a
French Cabin Boy, looking piquant, if not pert;
the other, Maritana, with crimson gloves that went
right up to her shoulder. They might have gone
farther; it’s hard to toll. Australia was a tall girl
in red, white, and blue, whose symmetry was not
concealed by her skirt; a capital dancer, too. A
Flower Girl was decked with flowers and ferns to
represent the season of flowers. Anyone who
looked at her bobbing muslin skirt would see it
represented the spring. A little girl in pinky
muslin, who lived “justacross the estate,” talked
and danced quite prettily, and was a Lord as well
as a lady. A girl in white broche and veiling, who
came late, was particularly catching; and a Glebe
young lady, in black grenadine, looked like the
essence of grace.

Next Wednesday, Madame Charbonnet-
Kellermann gives her solrde musicale in the Pro-
testant Hall. The musical programme is a gener-
ous one; and, as tho distribution of prizes, medals,
etc., will take up some time, it is well to bear in
mind that proceedings will begin at 7.30 p.m. sharp.

On Saturday last, the Corporation officers
hold their annual picnic at Corry's Gardens, Caba-
rlta. Shortly after 10 a.m. a steamer started from
No. 4 jetty, Circular Quay, and went a pleasant
cruise round tho harbour. The picnic party con-
sisted of gentlemen only, consequently the sports
indulged in were those requiring muscle and
agility; they wore admirably arranged, energeti-
cally pursued, and successfully carried out from
11 a.m. till 3 p.ra. The race for gentlemen over 40
years of ago might have been more emblematic,
for it was notable that the evergreen Barry Fox
and his agile compeer, M. Veaney, were absent,
notwithstanding they were freely spoken about as
likely winners. The other events were well con-
tested. tho results evidencing that the City Sur-
veyor’s department possessed the best athletes.
Wheu it is mentioned that several, of the prizes
were “ jam ” jars, and a spirit flask, anyone
can see’ they were appropriately chosen. The
programme was nicely diversified with items in
which all could meet. After the sports, about 90
officers adjourned to the pavilion, where tables
were well spread. Catering was by Mr. Oorrey,
and much appreciated. Mr. Woolcott presided,
and after about half-an-hour’sspell-bound silence,
during which time much was done to accelerate
the growth and development of a “ corporation ’
for each officer, the chairman proposed the loyal
toasts, and afterwards the health of the Mayor;
he spoke of the ability of that gentleman, and the
faculties which enabled him so worthily to fill the
Mayoral chair and discharge the duties of his
office. The toast was received with ardent zeal.
The Mayor briefly responded, and then proceeded
to present prizes to the successful competitors in
the sports. A new feature was introduced, viz.,
that of a concert and elocutionary entertainment
consisting of twelve items, which were ably ren-
dered by several officers. The song by Mr. A.
Oheek-e White seemed to be very well sung. Mr.
Veaney’s recitation merited much applause. The
committees worked well, and altogether the Cor-
poration officers had a most enjoyable picnic.
Some people may wonder how this can be, as there
were no ladies present; but we may explain that
many of the Corporation officers are married mew,
and it’s sometimes a relief, you know, to—to—well,
wo mean it’s a relief to the ladies to have an occa-
sional rest.
This year the Ei stern Suburbs Amateur
Athletic Club intend their annual reunion to take
the form of a private picnic and afternoon tea at
Tennyson. The idea is just suitable to this time
of year, and a jolly afternoon may be expected.
Of course, there will be dancing (good partners
assured) and sports. The Invincible leaves footot
Phlllip-street at 3 p.m. on Saturday.

In the Burrowa Times there is a column
of “Frivolities,’ by Annie the Flirt. We have
read weaker stuff, and wiser; but, anyhow, a lot
of girls can’t write half as well as Annie. One
jealous puss-Carrie, an’ it please you-tried to be
perfectly horrid the other day by casting a doubt
on the Flirt’s sex. It’s all right, though. Annie s
a girl, sure enough—
It’s true we’ve not seen her, but that is no matter,
For women are like some birds—
They are known by the way they incessantly
chatter.
And Annie s prolific In words!
Poor Carrie, you do not possess much acumen,
And all you’d be safe to assert
Would be: that this Flirt may not be a young
woman.
But evry young woman’s a flirt.

Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dearest Belle,—We thought we were only
going to the new Masonic Hall last Thursday night
to hear the Metropolitan Liedertafel; but there
was an after-piece when the concert was over,
which Ned likened to a “ wild beast shew,” but
which, I think, is rather too hard a name for an
exhibition of gross ill manners on the part of
human creatures. But such a crush and senseless
striving to be first out. just as though it were a
matter of life and death I I got so frightened that
Ned said we had better stand aside, for he assured
me there was nothing to fear if we only allowed
the beautiful creatures to have their way. So we
stood aside and gazed with wonder on the scene
before us, and for the first time in my life I was
able to comprehend how human beings got crushed
to death during a fire panic. And there never was
a plainer example of “more hurry, less speed.”
The doorways were jammed so tight at times that
actually the mass of people didn’t gain an inch a
minute, and one old lady had her cap dragged off
her head, whilst numerous clouds were torn off
fair shoulders by being brought into too close proxi-
mity with brooches, hairpins, bracelets, and the
like. When will people learn to show their good
breeding (if they have any) in leaving a crowded
concert room like rational beings Instead of wild
animals. I wonder! A glance into the cloak-room
was sufficient to show that matters were no better
there. The poor woman in charge was at her
wit’s ends in trying to keep order, and begged in
vain of the ladies to have patience, as she could
not attend to them all at once; but they wouldn’t
and didn’t have patience. The consequence
was—hats, cloaks, &c., were so tossed about
that many ladles were kept waiting twenty
minutes before theirs could be found at all. After
a long and patient wait, we were actually allowed
at last to make our exit, and breathed freely once
more ; but even yet our troubles were not at an
end, for we found that if we did not jump into
our cab before it drew up to the kerbing, others
with more expedition than good manners would
monopolise it, and drive away in triumph. Tired
and weary we were when wo got home that night,
I can assure you, but-Ave didn’t think we had paid
too dearly for hearing Madame and Mr. Badcliff
and Mr. Hallewell. And, you little puss, you must
have told Mr. Hallewell that I wanted to hear him
sing the “Valley” again—now, didn’t you? lam
sure you did; so don’t deny it. When you write to
him again, thank him from me for singing it, and
tell him how well we all enjoyed it—atleast, I did I
know. As for the Radoliffs, I really think if it
had not been for their music, I should quite be-
grudge the spoiling of the train of my new white
satin (serves me right for wearing one in a concert
room, doesn’t it 1) and losing my pretty pale-blue
chenille shawl. As it is, however, the pleasure of
hearing them more than compensated for both loss
and spoliation. Madame looked ever so charming
in a beautiful pink satin with long train. The
bodice, as well as the whole front of the skirt, was
covered with white beaded lace, which glistened
like thousands of dewdrops with every movement
of the fair cantatrice. A beautiful bouquet was
handed to her after her first solo ; it made mine
look so shabby and mean that I couldn't let Ned
throw it to her. I don’t know how anv flowers
managed to survive such a dreadful day as Wednes-
day. It was quite enough to account for the
scarcity of bouquets in the.Masonic Hall on
Thursday night.
I am much worried to know what those dear
little Tam O’Shanter hats are for which are being
shown in some of the shop windows. They cannot
possibly be for day-time wear, for they are so
flimsy and light that they would be hardly any
protection for the head. Listen to this, and judge
for yourself. A foundation of white net covered
with fine gold gauze, and fastened nearly in front
with a large buckle; a ueautiful amber and white
ostrich feather, so very long that the tip touches
the opposite shoulder. Now, it strikes mo that
some French milliner has sent out these dainty
hats, or, rather, caps, with the idea that we wear
hats in the theatres here, as they do in Paris, and
for that purpose these frail-looking things are
right enough. But I don’t know why they do wear
hats in theatres anywhere, for where’s the sense of
it ? Not only are they superfluous, but, more than
that, they are really inconvenient, and also con-
ducive to headaches. They should be as strictly
prohibited from concert halls and theatres as
babies In arms; for, if they don’t make a noise,
they get in our way and obstruct our view, which
is just as bad. Wo don’t see any in the theatres
here, but some people will persist in wearing either
bonnets or hats In our concert halls, which is
selfish, to say the least of it.
Herr Vogrich has Imposed upon himself a diffi-
cult task in his endeavours to imbue his audiences
with a taste for the highest classical music. His
intentions, no doubt, are excellent, but it strikes
me that he attempts too much at a time. A Schu-
bert, Schumann, and Spohr programme frightens
people, and the fact that, with one exception,
there were no encores demanded on the night of
the sixth concert, speaks for Itself. The exception
was Haydn’s quartette for strings, which, of
course, is familiar to everybody, and which was
received like an old and valued friend. Madame
Vogiich, most beautifully attired in a rich cream
silk with front width of the SKlrt of cerise satin,
sang charmingly, especially the “ Ave Marla.”
Mons. de Wllllmoff and Herr Vogrich were the
other soloists, the former playing a sweet cantabile
for violin, and Herr Vogrich several pianoforte
solos, one “Gavotte Hongrolse” being his own
composition, which is a more peculiar tnan pleas-
ing piece. As there are only two more concerts of
the series, I do hope to see good houses, and I
should like beyond anything to hear Madame sing
a simple ballad once more. Bad taste, no doubt,
but, at all events, I am not singular in this respect,
I do assure you.
In order to wipe out part of their debt, the com-
mittee of the Western Suburbs Musical Society
conceived the brilliant idea of having a matinee
on a Saturday afternoon. Just think of it! As if
anyone would go and sit out a matinee when the
sun was shining, the birds singing, and the balloon
about to ascend 1 And I don’t think it was quite
good taste to ask artists to give up their Saturday
afternoon just for the sake of singing and playing
to empty chairs and a handful of people. If I had
been those artists, I should have been “ real mad,”
as the Yankees say. There was Bass Hodge with
his band, Miss Josephine Deakin, Miss Sheridan
Reed, Mods, de Willimoff, Mr. Toms, and Mr.
Johnson—quite enough to make a good concert:
and it was a good concert, too. The only drawback
was in there being hardly anybody to listen to it.
The committee are furious with the Burwoodites
for not turning up, and the people laugh at the
committee for their folly in expecting them to do
so at such a time. What is it these people lack, I
wonder, that they can’t manage to keep together
their Musical Society without running into debt?
Bad management somewhere, I’m afraid.
The two monster ballad concerts which the
Radcliffs intend giving before leaving Sydney,
w'll, I hear, be postponed for a while, as they have
accepted numerous engagements which will fill
up their programme for some time to come. Just
as well, perhaps, as we have been regularly
satiated with concerts for the last two months.
But these ballad concerts are going to be specially
attractive, several items on the programmes being

quite novel. And Mons. Leon Caron has written a
“Grand Scena” for voice and flute for Madame
Radcliff, which she and Mr. Radcllfl! will intro-
duce for the first time at three concerts. I have
heard the song, dear, and it is something worth
listening to, I can tell you. I forget what it is
called, but there is In it a most clever double
cadenza for flute and voice, and exactly suited to
the two artists for whom it was written. I am
quite looking forward to hearing it again in a
large hall.
After a busy day of shopping last Friday, we
dropped into Compagnoni’s, just to see if the
music gave any additional relish to our ices and
cups of tea. You know they have matinees every
Tuesday and Friday, and really I think it is nicer
to eat and drink with a band accompaniment—it
seems to me more poetical, somehow. And Mr.
Tollemaohe, the manager, informed us all that if
we had any music of our own composition that we
would like to hear played by the band, he would
have it scored for us, and would announce to us
the day when it would be performed. Of course,
this is provided the music possess sufficient merit
to repay him for the trouble. And of course when
we know what day we may expect to bear our
very own music played, we snail proudly take our
friends and our friends’ friends to hear it, and then
we shall all want refreshments. Cunning of Mr.
Tollemaohe, isn’t it, dear ? But it’s a pleasant kind
of cunning.
I believe whole scenes of Mr. Searelle’s new
opera, “Bobabil,” are being photographed by
Tuttle and Co., so. if I can get hold of any, I will
send you one, so that you may form some sort of
an idea of what the opera Is like, and also see how
good-looking ;Mr. Harding is. Mr. Searelle evi-
dently knows what pleases the public, for this
opera not only draws good houses, but is likely to
run for some weeks to come. There goes the
dinner-bell, so I must away.
Yours ever,

UP IN A BALLOON.-A STRANGE STORY.
“Ma. is that man going up to Heaven?” said
a beautiful blue-eyed little girl who stood near the
balloon at Prince Alfred Park last Saturday. ‘ Oh
no net. The balloon is tied, and will be pulled
back again.” Little Nell, Innocently; “ Will he go
to Heaven if I should cut the rope? Ma confused,
and not knowing how to answer the child; but, on
reflection, said they would not be allowed to go in.
“ Why, mamma, only angels are allowed, then ?
What are angels; are they like us ?” “Oh no, my
child 1 Angels have wings and fly. I wonder if
vou and I and papa will get there and fly. I
hone so.” “ Don’t you think that man in the bal-
loon will get up there? Just see, mamma, he is
going up alive. What has he got in that basket?
I know it must be something good. Just see how
he smiles. Watch his lips; he can t keep them still.
I bet it’s lovely. It’s going up with him. Let me
go and see what it is?” The dear little angel
peeped into the aeronaut’s car, and then ran back
to its raotner delighted, her face full of joy, and
with that, child-like innocence looked into its
mother’s face, and said: “ Mamma, he will get into
Heaven- he has the Anbeuser Busch St. Louis
Lager Beer in his basket. Won’t papa be pleased?”*

BRIEF MENTION.
What’s in a name ? Letters.
The town and country journal: The Bul-
letin.
Not worth the space it “commands”: A
Holy Howl “ leader.”
The Rum scribe, whose tailor refused him
clothes on tick, says he was non-suited.
A Paddington man named his twin boys
“ Facts,” because they are “ stubborn things.”
Freckles were fashionable last summer in
America. Wo wonder If everstonebreakers’ warts
will get a show.
The Yass band performed in the open air
recently. The leader is an undertaker, and possibly
has trade in his eye.
(Supposed) remark of Sir ’Enery Parkes on
entering a country pub.: “ Have you accommoda-
tion for the Knight ?”
A Victorian legislator exchanged a pot of
white paint for green. This is the first time he has
ever been known to “change colour.”
Stockings are to be dispensed with in
England shortly. The sterner sex will now look
forward with pleasure to windy weather.
Excited Salvationist: “ Brethren, be honest,
be strong-willed, be faithful, and ” (as a diseased
egg collided with his nasal organ) “ be d—d I”
A religious paper says that George Wash-
ington was never guilty of lying. Does our con-
temporary mean to state that George slept standing
up ?
A conscientious suburban clergyman im-
bibes his wine with closed eyes, so as to escape
being reprimanded for “ looking on the wine when
it is red.
One of Alfred’s scribes has had a stroke
of adverse luck. He purchased a pair of stockings,
and his father disinherited him for reckless ex-
travagance.
“ What shall we do with John—he appears
to be the fool of the family ?” said Mrs. Jones, the
other day. “Oh, make a Holy Howl editor of
him,” replied paterfamilias.
The new Bishop of Riverina is to live near
a Brewery. God works for the best. It would be
hard lines if the Bishop’s jug had to be carted
through the streets on a Sunday.
Some evil-disposed person (probably a free-
thinker) knocked a shingle off the roof of a Wes-
leyan suburban church the other night. The
church is now a shingle short!
At Tanja, last week, a child, in resting its
weary head, placed it on that of a snake. We’ve
heard of them editing the Bourke papers in this
way—by the “ laying ” of heads together.
An Englishman has died at Marseilles,
apparently of cholera. There is, however, some
doubt in the matter, for in his pockets were found
a large number of Salvation Army tracts.
A red-nosed man went into a Pitt-street
hotel the other day, and blandly requested the
barmaid to give him some “ Cork whisky.” He got
it—two pieces of cork to the half-ounce of liquor.
A book will shortly be issued, entitled
“Letters from Hell.” It weuld be advisable to
wait till M’Elhone could assist in the compilation.
We’d read it then, and perhaps sympathise with
Mac.
A paragraph is published in the Adelong
AbGUS in which pleasure is expressed at the “ h*nt
about the cemetery being taken.” Why wouldn’t
it be ? The Adelontr people want to make things
as comfortable as they can for the Argus staff.
He was a cattle-man, and in the train he
planted his enormous hoof on the bea.utlfully-
varnished footlet of the exquisite opposite him.
Said the swell, at last, “ Don’t you think I had
better put my feet on yours ? There’s more room."
The smartest compositor in the typo-
graphical error business is employed by the Mary-
borough (Q.) Chronicle. He set up a sentence
that a horse, startled by something, turned and
made a colt. This is finding a mare’s nest with a
vengeance.
In New York there are thirty widows

went broke for their respective amounts, and
what (as a finish) was the average nutnoer of their
congregations.
A man weat to a dentist, and got him to
pull a stump. Then he refused to pay the fee (a
shilling), and gave the dentist’s assistant a thrash-
ing. We are glad to find that someone has at last
arisen to punish dentists for the cruelties indicted
by them on the human race.
As if Webb, of the Campbelltown Herald,
had not enough trouble already! On his arrival
from Sydney, the local band met him and played
“ Wait till the clouds roll by.” We don’t think
now that the case should require a second hearing,
and we await the announcement that defendant
has “gone to a higher tribunal ” with dread.
Apropos of the execution of Edwards in
N.Z. for the murder of his wife and four children,
an English paper says: “ A hangman disguised by
false Dundreary whiskers, is not altogether, one
would think, a fitting accompaniment to so solemn
an occasion. A little more latitude In this direc-
tion. and we shall hear from N.Z. of a hangman
carrying out the last sentence of the law in the
costume of a pantomime clown.” We venture to
remark that should the hangman appear disguised
as a clown, the culprit won’t laugh at his little
choke.
“Never was in such a fix in my life,” said
one of Alfred’s bards, telling to an apathetic audi-
ence, a wild Evunnoozer about some imaginary
adventure of hisaown; “had to hold on by the
hair of my teeth for two hours.” "You were
lucky in having such a strong hold,” said Shirker,
of the Lands, vocally italicising the last words of
the sentence, as he glanced at the gates that
barred the saveloy cemetery whence the fables
flowed. But to this day the child of song has not
found out what it was that made them ali laugh so
confoundedly.
TheSydney correspondent of the Southern
Argus writes to his influential journal concerning
the Evening News. And Alfred falls into the
trap, and republishes the following inter alia;—
“ The founder of the Evening News must have
been a man truly great.” “ And no one who had
noticed the pitiless logic of its (the News’)
masterly leaders - [on dump carts]—or the slashing
r j cklessness which marks its ‘ Brevity’ column—
[Coriolanus!]—can question the justice of Mr.
Smith’s estimate.” From time to time in our
small way we’ve tried to work up a little thing
about Alfred and the NOOSE, when copy wasn’t
coming in fast enough. But we were never bitter.
How the Southern Argus man must have
brooded over some real or fancied injury when he
could callously sit down, and take such a deadly
revenge I
“ German Syrup.” —No other medicine in
the world has ever given such a test of its cuia-
tive qualities as Boschee’s German Syrup. In
three years two million four hundred thousand
small bottles of this medicine were distributed
free of charge by Druggists in the United States of
America to those afflicted with Consumption,
Asthma, Croup, severe Coughs, Pneumonia, and
other diseases of the throat and lungs, giving the
afflicted undeniable proof that German Syrup will
cure them. The result has been that Druggists in
every town and village in civilized countries are
recommending it to their customers. Go to your
Druggist and ask what they know about it. Sample
Bottles 6d. Regular size, 3s. 6d« Three doses will
relieve any case.


“The Bulletin” Prize Statue Competition.
It may not be generally known that The Bulletin offered a prize some time since for a design for a statue of some sort, to be placed upon the pedestal in King-street, origin-
ally intended for the Queen’s statue. All efforts to secure a satisfactory statue of Her Majesty have failed. The fact is, Her Majesty has been found to be totally unsculpable
at this distance; so it occurred to us, that by choosing a subject nearer home this pedestal, upon which we have paid taxes so long, might have an occupant. “ We have,
thought we, “plenty of more or less great men knocking about, and all more or less statuesqueand it was only reserved for great minds, such as control the destinies of The
Bulletin, to find ways and means of supplying a “long felt want.”
We therefore, offered a prize of a few millions sterling, for a design to be competed for by all-oomers, only stipulating that the artist and the subject be Australasian. I altry
as the sum we offered was, we have been Hooded with models, all good; but our limited space will only admit of us placing a few before the world
1. “The Mythological Cheque Writer.” Design by Sir H. Parkes.
2. “ Cupid.” Designed by R. B. Smith.
3. Equestrian statue, “Lives of Great Men all Remind Us.” By John Lucas.
4. ‘‘ Wholesome Fun.” By Dan. O’Connor.
5. “Diogenes Looking for an Honest Man.” By J. Davies, C.M.G.
G. “High Art.” By our own Art Staff.
7. “ Eloquence.” By Sir John Robertson.
8. “A Mudgee Statesman in the Springtime of his Career reflecting upon Future Greatness—if he takes care of himself.” By A. G. Taylor.
9. “ A Great Undertaking.” By N. Melville.
10. “ I Want to be An Angel.” By J. M'Elhone (this design came by cable).
11. “ Tempos Mutantur.” By D. Buchanan.
12. “ Art Enlightening the World.” By E. Combes, C.M.G.
Note.—We have not yet quite decided upon the merits of any of the models, but we rather think No. 6 will take the gate-money.
