LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
THE PILL
Sir,
The letters of Fathers Kelly and
Rumble (25/7/64) call for some further
observations. Fr Kelly’s letter was not
the kind of response I had intended to
stimulate. He did not contribute to the
discussion, but provided an instance of
what many outside the Church regard as
the endemic evil of the intellectual life
of the Church in Australia, viz., name-
calling. Fr Kelly had few ideas to offer.
He was content to accuse me of not
being a gentleman.
My article, “A Catholic Case for the
Pill” (11/7/64) had a twofold purpose:
(a) To deplore the suppression of in-
formation necessary for the adequate
formation of the consciences of Catho-
lics—information to which they have a
right. ; .
- (b) To indicate some lines of thought
which make the conservative case'appear
less conclusive than some of them claim.
It was not my intention to attack or
insult Fr Hogan. I used his perform-
ance in “Four Corners” as an instance
of what will inevitably result when there
is not a prevailing climate conducive to
mature and frank discussion.
Perhaps it has not occurred to Fr
Kelly to wonder why the advocates of
the pill feel constrained to remain
anonymous. It could be that the Church
in Australia has not yet reached the
degree of maturity which would allow
men to espouse unpopular causes with-
out being subjected to the intolerance
and refinements of ecclesiastical abuse
(e.g., “disloyalty”) still only too pre-
valent. Anonymity is not necessarily
cowardice; it could be demanded by pru-
dence and the exigencies of living with
associates who see these issues in terms
of black and white.
Both Fr Kelly and Dr Rumble need
to know that Pope Paul’s request con-
cerning the public airing of views such
as mine did not appear until the article
had gone to print.
Dr Rumble’s first point was well
taken. Pius XII was more forthright in
his condemnation than I acknowledged.
The question of “the official attitude
of the Church” to the pill, however, is
a more complicated one. An assertion
in a papal allocution is certainly “autho-

ritative” and is, therefore, to be given
a value corresponding to this authority.
But does this constitute the official at-
titude of the Church? Be this as it may,
Catholics needed to know that the whole
question was being re-examined. They
needed to be told of the statement of
Cardinal Ottaviani; they needed to be
given the statement of Pope Paul VI,
unadorned. Instead they were told in
the “Catholic Weekly” that “Pope Paul
spoke with the apparent intention of
ending the current controversy over the
possible legitimacy for using certain re-
cently-discovered hormone pills which
can prevent conception”. This insight
into the intention of Pope Paul is ap-
parently another instance of the charism
afforded to those who are defending the
conservative cause. The text of the
Pope’s statement says simply that the
whole question is under scrutiny and,
until further notice, the norms laid down
by Pius XII “must therefore be con-
sidered valid at least until we feel bound
in conscience to modify them”.
Moreover, a pronouncement in a
papal allocution is still a factor, even
though a weighty one, amongst others
that must go on to the scales of con-
science. Amongst these other factors are
the opinions of important theologians
and the dictates of natural law as ap-
preciated by the individual. Another
factor, in this instance, is the possibility,
suggested by Dr Mino Pasetto and Fr
Antonio Nalesso (reported in the Lon-
don “Tablet”, July 4th, and the “Catho-
lic Leader” of Brisbane, July 16th, but
not in the “Catholic Weekly”) that Pius
XII was given misleading medical advice
concerning the effects of the pill. Fr
Nalesso, Professor of Morals at Milan
University, is reported as saying: “There-
fore, if Pius XII judged the use of the
pill illicit, solely for its sterilising pro-
perty, opposition today should dissolve.”
Information on all aspects of this
crucial matter is the right of all intelli-
gent Catholics. They need this infor-
mation not simply to titillate their intel-
lectual curiosity, but to enable them to
form their consciences in this regard.
Much of this information is being sup-
pressed, and this is my complaint.
A Catholic Priest
Sir,
It is a pity the Roman Catholic priest
who contributed the article “A Catholic
Case for the Pill” did not make a
thorough study of the conservative case
before attacking it. His reference to “im-
mutable” principles of natural law sug-
gests that he doubts whether there are
any such things. But a genuine system
of ethics is impossible unless one admits
some absolute principles, and if non-
Catholic intellectuals find this insistence
on principles “mysterious”, it is because
most of them have adopted the erroneous
philosophy of empiricism and deny the
possibility of valid generalisations about
human nature.
The statement that Catholic theolo-
gians find principles a “panacea” for
solving moral problems reveals a woe-
ful ignorance of Catholic moral theolo-
gy, especially of casuistry. If principles
were a panacea, there would be no
casuistry.
His inference from the words of Pius
XII that the Pope left some room for
discussion is based on a misinterpretation
of the text. “There is question here of
direct sterilisation” could have been
rendered with equal fidelity as “what
we are dealing with here is direct sterili-
sation”. This is clear from the cate-
gorical statement in the same address:
“One causes a direct sterilisation, and
therefore an illicit one, whenever one
stops ovulation in order to preserve the
uterus and the organism from the con-
sequences of a pregnancy which they
are not able to stand. Certain moralists
pretend that it is permitted to take drugs
for this purpose, but this is a mistake”.
This makes nonsense of his statement
that “the Church has not made an offi-
cial pronouncement yet”. The words of
Pius XII are a sufficient guide for the
Catholic priest, who, though he may not
have studied Philosophy I in an Aus-
tralian university, knows enough theology
to accept the teaching of the Pope in
preference to the speculations of avant-
garde theologians which the Pope has
already dismissed as mistaken.

“HONI SOIT” AND THE NAZIS
Sir,
1 am not one of those who anticipate
a Nazi takeover in this country; yet I
feel that the events you report (“The
Nazis and the Students”, 11/7/64) are
alarming, not because the few local
Nazis hold fantastic views, but because
the editor of the Sydney University
student newspaper “Honi Soit” goes to
some lengths to publicise them, and then
cries freedom of speech when their
Jewish victims protest (“standover tac-
tics”). Brown-shirted crankery is less of
a problem in our society than the under-
graduate nihilism which considers it
newsworthy.
The issue of “Honi Soit” for June 30,
which I have in front of me, presents
two propaganda articles, one by the
leading English Nazi, Colin Jordan, one
(represented as “the substance of an
interview”, but plainly, in effect, a mani-
festo) by his Australian counterpart, plus
a self-righteous editorial announcing the
editor’s determination to oppose “those
groups trying hardest to suppress this
Party”.
Jordan’s article is a beauty: the Jews
have falsified the records relating to their
own persecution; there were not 6 mil-
lion of them murdered, but only
1,500,000; and, if one broke down this
latter figure, one could reduce it to
300,000; and, if one questioned even
that figure, one would find . . . and so
on, and so on.
The editor of “Honi Soit”, in his zeal
for somebody's freedom of speech, has
deliberately promoted, 20 years after the
fortunate failure of “the final solution”,

the same monstrous lies about the nature

response of the victims of this lie, he
pleads the rights of its propagators not
so much to voice it, as to voice it in the
newspaper which he edits on behalf of
the whole student body of SU. In doing
this, he is pleading his own right to
commission, or reprint, imported insult,
and to present an interview in the form
of a commissioned manifesto.
Over the past three years we have had
some quite unusual examples of under-
graduate nihilism from people in posi-
tions of responsibility; the present one is
the worst of all, which is saying some-
thing.
In the same issue of “Honi Soit”,
there is an article ridiculing the Chief
Secretary of NSW for censoring a film
which apparently shows human excre-
ment dropping from the skies. Well,
one could have bet that excrement
would get in somewhere; and the inter-
esting thing is that someone should have
wanted to show it, not that someone
else should want to prevent its showing.

DEFAMATION
Sir,
As a Victorian I hesitate to trespass
on the area of controversy over the
NSW Defamation Act and, in particular,
to criticise your Special Correspondent's
interpretation (25/7/64). A complete
copy of the Act is not available locally.
However, it is perhaps reasonable to
query his contention that, in the case of
imputations about persons now dead, the
“person defamed” referred to in the
“saving” paragraph must be the dead
person.
The definition of the “defamatory
matter” pretty clearly lays down that,
in the case of imputations concerning a
dead person, such imputations are only
defamatory (a) if they are likely to in-
jure the reputation of a living person
and (b) if the dead person was a member
of his family. Surely, then, the living
person is the person defamed. If I say
“The late John Doe was a rogue; all
his wealth was obtained by highway rob-
bery”, without knowing that his son,
Richard, is living in luxury on his in-
heritance, is not Richard the person
defamed and would I not be entitled
to rely on the saving paragraph?

OPERA HOUSE LIGHTING
Sir,
We were interested to read Patricia
Rolfe's article on the Sydney Opera
House (18/7/64), particularly the com-
ment that no one seems to be able to
give an example of a small or large
saving in the cost.
We can offer such an example to those
interested, as our tender (by invitation,
please note) for stage lighting and con-
trol equipment was approximately
£A200,000 lower than the German
quote which was accepted. As our
principals have just completed a large
installation in the Royal Opera House at
Covent Garden, which contract was w o i
in fair competition with the same Get
man company, we feel that the add'i
tional expense of using more compM
and little-known (in Australia) Confined
tal equipment is hardly justified, to say/
nothing of the salaries of the additions'
operators required.
In the early days of the Sydney pro l
ject one stated aim was that therf
should eventually be three compatibly
theatres —one each in Melbourne, Cant
berra and Sydney—in order that organit
sations such as the Theatre Trust could?
travel performances more economical!'/
Nothing is yet known of the theatre(sj
to be built as part of the Melbourn*
Cultural Centre, but certainly there if
no compatibility between the new Can-
berra Civic Auditorium and the Sydney
“Opera House” Minor Hall, unless thos?
shows intended for touring completely
ignore the stage machinery to be pro,
vided in the latter.

DUNTROON
Sir,
Mr C. A. Nicol, Director of Publil
Relations for the Army Department, ii
surely joking when he attempts to justify
his ludicrous Duntroon advertisement
(25/7/64). Until the Military Board
changes its current policy of preventing
officers from leaving the Army to takf
up “leadership positions” in civil life
the chance of graduates being “num
bered among our great men" must br
very slight indeed.
If Army Minister Forbes had beei
prevented from transferring to the Re
serve, one cannot help wondering how
great a man he would now be. One of
his class is still a Major and the
mainder. unable to find suitable employ-,
ment outside the Service, are all rela
tively junior Lieutenant-Colonels.
With only two exceptions, like all thi
other successful men mentioned by Mi
Nicol, Dr Forbes gained his qualificaj
tions and political advancement despite)
and not as a result of. his attendance ait
the Royal Military College.

“OPHELIA”
Sir,
In National Notebook (18/7/64) it
was stated that Anna Volska playe?
Ophelia in the Old Tote's production ol
‘'Hamlet” last year. As your reportef
could have discovered for herself by a
glance at a review of the play, the part
was played by Janice Dinnen.
It is interesting to note that Mi si
Dinnen (who, like Miss Volska, is under
20 and comparatively successful) alsQ
plans to leave for England within a few
months. Perhaps this trend, combined
with the current popularity of our “All-
Male Revues”, will lead to a revival ol
the Shakespearean tradition of having
boys playing the girls’ parts.

National Notebook
vExport Variety
fW E to Peter Randall, of Mel-
jVl bourne’s St Martin’s Theatre, just
■ back from London, about the prospects
for Australian plays there. Or, rather,
1 Randall revised it carefully, plays by
■Australian playwrights. “If you talk
[about Australian plays in London, they
j j us t think you mean ‘The Doll’,” he said.
( Mr Randall was in Sydney for a few
f days to see Burton Graham’s play
“Breakfast with Julia”, originally played
,at St Martin’s, safely into the Phillip
•Theatre. “Breakfast with Julia” was one
jof the plays by Australian writers which
I Mr Randall took to London. It has been
1 sold to Jack Hylton for stage production
with an option of film rights. Mr Ran-
dall also interested Miriam Karlin (inevi-
tably known as “The Rag Trade” girl)
another play by Mr Graham, “These
f Cats are Dangerous.” This
i has three characters, all
played by the one woman,
i Another item of interest
iis that the Royal Shake-
spearian Company is con-
sidering production of
Douglas Stewart's “Ship-
wreck”. Mr Randall believes there is
interest in a film version too.
Mr Randall said that, in general, plays
by Australians must be regarded as part
' of Australia’s export. “I hate to talk
, about plays as merchandise,” he said,
1 “but they must be sold that way. We
*don’t want to export any play until it
fhas proved its worth in this country.
After that, they shouldn't need Govern-
ment subsidy, as ‘The Doll’ did when the
Elizabethan in part underwrote its West
End production. The plays should be
able to make their own way through
k normal channels. Do you know, you
1 can make £ 100 a week for five years out
of a play that never hits the West End—
simply by playing all the reps.? On the
other hand, when 1 came to buying plays
for St Martin's, I found I could pick up
very good plays which were being over-
# looked by agents, simply because they
hadn’t been in the West End.”
Mr Randall, a fourth - generation
theatrical, has been with St Martin’s since
he came out of the Services. He has
seen it grow from an amateur theatre
seating 120 to a “95 per cent” profes-
sional theatre, putting on 13 productions
a year in an air-conditioned auditorium
seating 400. The “95 per cent” basis
remains because in most productions a
couple of people are on a trainee basis,
although St Martin's does not run a
theatre school. For example, in Mr
Randall’s next production, “All in Good
Time”, there will be nine professional
actors and two paid at a subsistence
level.
In fact, St Martin’s seems already to
have reached the point which the
Elizabethan, with Government subsidy,
is aiming for. “I feel rather sorry for
the Trust,” Mr Randall said amiably.
“They lack theatres. You can’t get any-
where without facilities, without real
estate.”
Stoic
EFhe death of Sir John Latham brought
4 many tributes to his public career.
Less well known is the burden of
private grief he stoically endured.
His son Dick had outstanding intel-
lectual gifts and, if he had lived, would
probably have become a lawyer of great
eminence. A Rhodes Scholar from Vic-
toria in 1931, he later won a Fellow-
ship of All Souls at Ox-
ford. When the war came
he was put into the
Foreign Office, but re-
signed his post there to
join the RAF. He met his
death as an air navigator
in Coastal Command.
Sir John’s only daughter, Freda, died
some years ago; his wife’s death occurred
a few months before his own.
On page 34 Mr M. H. Ellis provides
a memoir on Sir John Latham.
Music, Music
rPHE world’s best-known dispenser of
sedation from the ceiling, Muzak,
has just had its third birthday in Aus-
tralia. Muzak’s round-the-clock back-
ground music now extends to 19 coun-
tries, and Australia has the fastest
growth-rate of them all. Only a shortage
of PMG landlines for transmitting pro-
grammes keeps the franchise holders,
Planned Music Sydney Pty Ltd and
Planned Music Melbourne Pty Ltd, from
even bigger things.
We called the other day on Mr C. W.
Gidley, manager of the Sydney company,
at his office in the 2GB building. Mr
Gidley, accompanied by a light sprinkle
of music from overhead, told us that his
clients numbered nearly 200, and in-
cluded banks, factories, offices and
hotels; even, he said, the labor wards
of a hospital. “I know it seems Big
Brother-ish,” he said disarmingly, “but
I think Muzak’s really a pretty whole-
some thing; and the fact is, it works .”
He showed us a graph of the average
person’s “work efficiency curve”, with
its depressing mid-morning and mid-
afternoon slumps. Then he showed how
the “Muzak stimulus curve” flattened
out the slumps and improved efficiency.

Muzak tunes give delight and hurt
not. Mr Gidley explained that because
they must be non-distracting, they are
arranged and played in a way that
removes all the stimulation from them.
As he was saying this, a tepid fragment
of Grieg’s piano concerto sprinkled
down. It distracted us, and we drew it
to his attention. “People take three
weeks to become conditioned to the
tunes,” he said with a smile.
As we left we asked Mr Gidley if
there were private houses with Muzak.
“Overseas, private rentals are seven
per cent of business,” he said. “But
here it’s just starting. I’ve got one
private client at Vaucluse, and another
coming on at Kirribilli.” We asked him
if he had Muzak in his own house. “Not
yet,” he said.
Attraction
Government Tourist Bureau in
Darwin estimates that this year
25,000 tourists will have visited the
Northern Territory. Not bad, considering
that the Territory’s population is only
36,000. The tourist industry now ranks
after beef and minerals.
Part of the Tourist Bureau’s promotion
is the Darwin Festival, which ran through
most of July. Some of the events were
the North Australian Eisteddfod, the
Darwin Show, and the 1000-mile bicycle
race from Alice Springs. There were also
special scenic flights to nearby mission
islands.
People in the North are urging Can-
berra to grant more money for such
things as an improved Port Augusta-Alice
Springs road. It is considered that if
25,000 people will visit the North now,
with improved access this figure could
rise sharply.

llTe’re always the first to agree that

We were talking to a radio-cab des-
patcher the other day about the dif-
ficulties of handling the movements of
a fleet of cars with nothing but your
strong lungs and cool head to help you.
“The other night in the rush-hour,”
he said, by way of illustration, “I had
directed four cabs for separate pick-ups
at the same hotel. It was important that
each driver got his correct fare, because
of future movements. But after the first
taxi reported that he had picked up his
fare I knew he’d got someone else’s.
‘Are you sure you’ve got the right
name?’ I asked. ‘Of course, boss, f,
wouldn’t make a mistake,’ he answered!
cheerfully. ‘Well, who have you got J
your car?’ I asked. ‘lt’s a baldy O ]J
coot with a bad temper,’ came back'
over the radio, clear and loud. I tuned
out and left him to his ride with ]
baldy old coot with a bad temper.” ;

Singapore’s Riots
Singapore riots were serious
A and their significance should be
clearly understood in Australia
which has a deep interest in the
stability of Malaysia and is com-
mitted to its defence. The riots were
not merely isolated, communal ex-
plosions between Malays and
Chinese in a predominantly Chinese
city. They were planned and or-
ganised and UMNO, the major
political party in Malaya, and its
Secretary-General, Dato Syed Jaafar
Albar, must take the ultimate blame.
There has been a great deal of
UMNO tolerated, if not sponsored,
propaganda to the effect that Malays
and Chinese cannot live together,
that the Singapore Chinese seek the
extension of Chinese power to the
peninsula and that the Malays in
Singapore do not receive the same
privileged treatment in Singapore as
they do in Malaya. But behind
these crude excuses for a riot lies
simmering communal and political
resentments. The simple fact is that
Lee Kuan Yew’s dynamic PAP has
done more with slum clearance,
energetic development of industrial
estates like Jurong and the develop-
ment of social and community ser-
vices than is yet thought of in
Malaya. All of this has been the
cause of general Alliance political
jealousy in Kuala Lumpur while the
extension of the PAP’s power into
the peninsula has been the source of
Alliance resentment and worry.
T)AP efficiency is a constant remin-
der to the Alliance of its own
inefficiency just as the public record
of the probity of the PAP Ministry
is a general reproach to consistent
rumors of Alliance graft and corrup-
tion in Kuala Lumpur. Communal-
ism has entered the picture, ironi-
cally enough, partly because Lee
Kuan Yew avoids it. The PAP is
the only political party in Malaysia
which is genuinely Malaysian in ap-
proach. Campaigning on a non-
communal basis it seeks to gather
Indians and Malays as well as
Chinese to its banner.
It stands as a genuinely non-
communal alternative to the United
Malays National Organisation, the
Malayan Indian Congress and the
Malayan Chinese Association. These
organisations are, broadly speaking,
non-communal in theory but fairly
communal in approach. Chinese,
Indians and Malayans joining
UMNO, for example, join the
communal sections of the Alliance.
The fact that the PAP is preponder-
antly Chinese may make it easier
to make the gesture of recruiting
non-Chinese on the basis of equality,
but even so there can be no doubt
of the PAP’s urgent sense of Malay-
sian nationalism as opposed to the
narrower interests represented by
the Alliance. This undoubtedly
worries many Alliance politicians in
Kuala Lumpur who fear that those
Malays who leave the Malay-
aligned parties in response to PAP
propaganda will never return.
The riots have at least had one
salutary effect in this country in
dampening some of the mindless
enthusiasm with which Australia
continues to regard Malaysia as the
most orderly, trouble-free country
in Asia. In fact it faces exactly the
same problems as other Asian
countries and the solution to those
problems is of extreme importance
to this country.
It is obvious that orderly eco-
nomic progress in a country of
potentially explosive and deep-
seated communal differences is not
possible until those differences are
resolved. In other Afro-Asian
countries, with the miraculous ex-
ception of India, racial and other
differences have been solved by the
gradual abolition of democratic
systems of government with their
apparatus of alternative parties and
political freedom. This has had to
be, for all have found that indepen-
dence has made no difference to the
intractable economic and political
problems facing them in the post-
colonial period—in fact, indepen-
dence has merely exacerbated them.
T'he simple answer in the majority
of cases, after a period of time,
has been for the dominant political
and racial party to impose strong
central government merely to get on
with the business of government, let
alone that of raising living and
educational standards. This is not
a possible solution for Malaysia,
almost equally balanced, as it is,
between two races. Any attempt
by the Malays or Chinese to im-
pose exclusive rule on Malaysia will
result in a communal bloodbath. It
is impossible for Malaysia to survive
except on a non-communal basis.
While there are sufficient Malays
and Chinese, not to mention Indians,
who treasure what Malaysia has
given them peace and a higher
standard of living and education than
exists elsewhere in Asia it is
quite obvious that communalism is
becoming a critical issue. Beleaguer-
ed from without by a tough and re-
sourceful enemy, Malaysia is enter-
ing on its most critical period.
Much will depend on the Tunku
who is legendary not merely for his
genuinely non-communal approach
to Malaysian problems but for his
capacity to get men of goodwill
to work together.
Whether he has the capacity to
be ruthless with men of ill-will in
his own Alliance remains to be seen,
for he is an ageing man with some-
thing of the fair-weather sailor
about him.

THE BUDGET
Holt’s Dilemma
Cost inflation or demand inflation?
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
TREASURER HOLT
Tight cost corner
TJehind the Budget which the Federal
Treasurer will bring down next
Tuesday night will lie the answer to as
sharp a dilemma as Mr Holt has had
to deal with in the six Budgets he has
prepared since he took over from Sir
Arthur Fadden in 1959. The dilemma
is whether cost inflation or demand in-
flation is going to be the main villain of
the economic piece this year.
Business leaders were at pains in their
recent economic talks with the Govern-
ment to stress their anxiety about cost
inflation and to abjure the Treasurer to
leave demand alone in the Budget. As
they see it —and several of them were
hammering away at this theme again
last week—the problem is to absorb the
rise in the basic wage into costs without
need for price increases. Against all the
evidence, however, they refuse to see
that these same wage rises threaten
seriously to create excess effective de-
mand, which, in its turn, could well lift
prices of its own accord.
Despite what the majority judgment in
the recent basic wage case said, and
despite the protestations of the trade
unions (for instance, those of the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council last Thurs-
day), industry is very hard put to it to
absorb the £1 increase without in-
creasing prices. One reason is that this
increase comes on top of a steep rise in
average wage earnings in the year before
its award. Figures released last week
by the Commonwealth Statistician show
that in the 12 months to March this year
(this is before the award, which was on
June 9) average weekly earnings index
for all industries rose from 149.7 to
158.6, or by about 6 per cent.
So, not considering any wages drift
since March, the basic wage rise is not
something that employers can shrug off,
and it is very understandable that they
want, as far as possible, to get their
additional wage costs back by way of
increased turnovers. They fear that if
the Government sees the main problem
as one of curtailing effective demand,
and increases taxation to solve it, busi-
nesses will be left on a limb with only
one course left —to increase prices. Not
only that; they fear that if the Govern-
ment is envisaging some excess of de-
mand this year and thinks the economy
needs a dampener, or even if it is merely
skirting around for more revenue to
meet its expanded expenditure, then it
may well increase company tax and so
push companies further into their already
tight corner.
Obviously, this would be against all
the strenuous advice the business world
gave the Government at the Canberra
talks, when it again pressed hard for
the abolition, or at any rate reduction,
of the pay roll tax, and for higher
depreciation allowances.
TTowever, this year one would expect
the Treasurer to look very sympathe-
tically at business in its tight cost corner,
and what he sees could strongly influ-
ence his approach to taxation changes.
But if there is also, as seems more likely,
going to be inflationary pressure from
the demand side, this will in turn ease
the problems of companies. The main
question may be to what extent the
Treasurer feels it is necessary to cut
back demand.
Nobody should be greatly surprise!
if he decides to end the 5 per cent rebate
on income tax, especially if he does sF
in the interest of a higher bill for dsf
fence. On the other hand— and thF
depends on his estimate of whether pan
ticular industries are claiming too bit
a share of available resources—he mat!,
look to sales tax, say on motor vehicles
as another means of checking spending
power. Again, excise duties, particit
larly on tobacco (for social as well as
economic reasons) could be in for ath
extra slug as a mopping-up measure. !
After the pious judgments of the Arbi*
tration Commission, to most people i!
would seem ironic that, to syphon of,
excess spending power, the Treasurer ha!
to deprive wage-earners of an even big> e
ger slice of their increase in the bask
wage than was envisaged when th&p
judgments were promulgated. But thafi
was an ever-present possibility before thet
Commissioners in the prevailing condiv
tions of full employment and
shortages, and makes it all the morif
inexplicable why they increased thjv
wage by so much. k
If the Treasurer is really gunning first!
and foremost for spending power this
time, he will doubtless also look hard £
some particular areas where demand ip
high, such as in the rural sector, whic! 5
had its best year ever in 1963-64 and is
bursting with income. 1
In the matter of investment, probabl £
the next most bountiful source of ini'
come, and of potentially excessive spends
ing power, Mr Holt has already read z (
stern lesson to the Premiers so far ai<
their part in public sector investment iu
concerned and it will be up to thi'
Treasurer, for all the recent pleas fob
faster and faster growth, to match his
words with reasonable figures. Happily!
Dr Coombs appears to be watching pry
vate investment very closely.
ELECTIONS
Renshaw versus Menzies
Jockeying for position at the polls
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
PREMIER RENSHAW
Window dressing?
A double dissolution of both houses
of the Federal Parliament early
next year is not beyond the bounds of
possibility, even though the Liberals an
preparing for a separate Senate election
in November.


{ this point of time it looks as if the
Ljme Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, has
L political situation well in hand. The
\deral Labor leader, Mr Arthur Cal-
L\\ f m ust take much of the responsi-
bility for putting him in this happy
position. When Mr Calwell decided to
bolster and reinforce the Left-wing Vic-
torian ALP executive which, elector-
rk)iy 5 has hung round Labor’s neck for

'backing for ALP Senate pre-selection
“Mr Les Haylen, defeated in Parkes at
“the last Federal elections, he presumably
inew what he was doing and why he
4as doing it. But nobody else seems to
'know, because on the election results of
past 10 years the Victorian ALP
/executive is not a Labor asset.
But while Sir Robert may have the
apolitical situation well in hand, he has
s>y no means complete control of the
’time situation. He will be the man who
will formally decide the Senate election
date, but the NSW Labor Premier, Mr
Renshaw, could produce a situation in
[which Sir Robert would be unable to
the Senate to the electors on the
date he would prefer.
Three States NSW, SA and WA
have to have their State elections before
the middle of next year. Renshaw and
his followers would certainly prefer to
hold theirs as far away from Federal
lentanglement as they can get. Inevitably,
>after 20-odd years in office, they have
ienough difficulties of their own. They
/do not want to carry the extra burden
of the electoral unpopularity of their
ALP colleagues in Victoria, the Left-
wing alignments of the Federal ALP
authorities, and the other factors that
.have depressed Labor’s vote nationally.
I|t is in Renshaw’s interest to attract the
voters’ attention to himself and his
NSW Labor colleagues rather than to
the Federal antics of the party whose
label he carries in the State sphere. He
could strike first. He could announce
his elections for the end of this year. If
he came out with his announcement
before Menzies officially fixed the date
for the Senate elections, Menzies would
have to push back his elections into the
first half of 1965.
The Liberals do not expect Renshaw
do this. They believe that Renshaw
wants more time for preparation, and
to consolidate his political situation. He
still has a lot of window-dressing to do
before he can appeal to the electors with
reasonable confidence. But though the
Liberals do not think Renshaw will,
there is always the possibility that he
might.
If he does so, and forces Menzies to
a 1965 Senate election, a most interest-
ing situation would open up. The
political factors that would be operating
in Menzies’ favor in a Senate election
would similarly be operating in his
favor for a House of Representatives
election.
A t present elections for the House of
Representatives and Senate do not
take place simultaneously, as they norm-
ally have done since Federation. They
are out of kilter. The Menzies Govern-
ment decision to have an early election
for the House of Representatives in 1963
was what threw them off. By the first
half of next year Menzies would have
to consider whether he should have a
Senate election and then an election for
the House of Representatives in 18
months’ time, or whether he should send
both Houses to the country simul-
taneously, thereby restoring the elections
of the two Houses to the former, normal
practice.
Menzies could probably justify this,
both constitutionally and politically. He
is a very old, experienced and astute dog
politically, and keeps a flexible mind on
elections. He holds them when events
and circumstances combine to make
them as advantageous to him and his
followers as the timetable laid down by
the Constitution permits.
But I have no doubt that the possi-
bility of a double dissolution and an
election in the first half of next year
for both Houses—and an assessment of
the value that such a course of action
might have for him and his Government
is floating round at the back of his
mind. Whether this thought will crystal-
lise into a decision, to do precisely that,
remains to be seen, but the prospects of
a decision to do so will undoubtedly
improve if Renshaw (a) decides to hold
his State elections before the end of
this year and (b) beats Menzies to the
punch by announcing his elections be-
fore Menzies has a chance to announce
his.
There is a nice little battle of judgment
going on between these two that could
have most interesting repercussions upon
the timetables and intentions of both
politicians.
ENTERTAINMENT
Sometimes on Sundays
Mr Rylah looks at a “disorderly house 99
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
A. G. RYLAH
Filins after Church?
Victoria’s gloomy Sundays may be
brightened a little as a result of
moves initiated by the Chief Secretary
Mr A. G. Rylah. Last week Mr Rylah
spoke of Victoria’s legislation covering
picture theatres, live shows and other
entertainment on Sundays as "a mess”.
Even more encouraging was his an-
nouncement that he had ordered an in-
vestigation into Sunday cinema shows in
ether States
. , , ,
Present legislation.is scattered through
various Victorian Acts, but pro™,ons
of Acts dating from he reigns of Charles
II and George 111 also apply.
The issue came to a head a little
earlier when two nightclub operators
were to be prosecuted with “keeping a
disorderly house”. They were, in fact,
being charged with providing entertain-
ment on a Sunday, but under common
law, the charge had to be phrased in
this exotic way. Moreover, the “dis-
orderly house” charge involved trial by
judge and jury. Mr Rylah said this
seemed inappropriate,
The case became even more mvolved.
Mr Ry ' ah , s J l . ,d ,hat a “ er t he
I'etary had discussed the charges with the
Deputy Police Commissioner, it was
understood that the charges were to be
withdrawn by arrangement with the
accused. Apparently, Mr Rylah, added,
withdrew the charges without
P arrangem en. being made and as a
resu|( cos(s were awarded inst the
]ice
Even the hint of Sunday cinemas and
entertainment drew protests from the
churches. Anticipating this, Mr Rylah
said that in his view, if cinemas opened
on Sundays, they should do so only after
church services had finished, as in Perth.

ABORIGINES — I
The Execution of
“Chimney” Evans
Justice for “Skinny Jack ” and “Left Hand ”
FROM AN ADELAIDE CORRESPONDENT
Five years ago a misguided Aborigine
called “Chimney” Evans stole a
number of sacred and highly-revered
relics belonging to his tribe and sold
them to a tourist. He knew that this
meant his death under tribal law, and
he prudently kept out of reach of the
executioners by living under white pro-
tection at the tiny opal township of
Coober Pedy.
He might still be alive if he had not
been a violent man, particu’arly after
he had been drinking. One night last
March he went to the humpy of a
member of his tribe and, as Mr Justice
Chamberlain expressed it at the trial of
his six killers, “behaved offensively”.
“Chimney,” in fact, seemed intent on
committing suicide; he returned later,
still belligerent, and pulled down a post
supporting the humpy.
Details of the subsequent execution
of “Chimney” were related at the recent
Adelaide trial of Willy Murray, aged
38, sometimes known as Willy Wheel-
barrow, of Coober Pedy; Alec Lennon,
about 50, of Coober Pedy; Dick Carroll,
39, of Anna Creek; “Skinny Jack”, about
50, of Yalata; Peter Lovegrove, some-
times known as Aines or Nyinga, of
Coober Pedy; and Johnny Allsopp, 20,
sometimes known as “Left Hand”, of
Yalata. All pleaded guilty to having
conspired together to kill and murder
“Chimney” Evans, another tribesman.
Willy Wheelbarrow had “quietened”
Evans with several blows from a steel
auger, said Mi Justice Chamberlain in
a notable understatement. He added:
“The six defendants met and decided
that Evans should be put to death. The
sentence so imposed was carried out by
strangling him with a rope as he lay in
a drunken sleep in his car.
“The evidence does not reveal who
actually applied the rope, but all six
had agreed to what was to be done and
five of them were present. The only
one absent was Lennon, who is said to
have been a tribal elder and therefore
would have spoken with considerable
authority at the meeting.”
Mr Justice Chamberlain said he agreed
that the six Aborigines were reputable,
ordinarily law-abiding people and the
main contention was that they acted in
accordance with tribal law, but there
was a limit to the extent that the court
could accept that claim as an excuse for
a serious crime.
“No doubt tribal justice may be
administered among the tribes in their
native habitats in ways in which white
authorities may be well advised not to
interfere,” he said.
“But where the Aborigine comes
within white influence he must learn to
obey white man’s laws, and if tribal
elders do not understand this they must
be taught it in no uncertain terms.
“If they were white men convicted
of a similar crime they could expect
sentences many times as severe as those
I aim to impose. Moreover, I would
have expected the charge to be murder,
not merely conspiracy to commit it.”
Willy Wheelbarrow, Carrol, Lennon
and “Skinny Jack” were sent to gaol for
two years, and Lovegrove and “Left
Hand”, who are much younger, for 12
months.
ABORIGINES - II
Staying on the Wagon
Discrimination will die of shame
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
IIfEST Australia's 1500 Aborigines of
" the south-west land division have
accepted their legal right to drink with
a dignity that few expected. Among the
few was Native Welfare Minister Edgar
Lewis, a Country Party man who had
much to lose by failure. As he said:
“I am not surprised, but I am pleased.”
Many outside the department were
surprised not only with the smoothness
of the change but with the limited re-
sponse to it. In Moora, near Lewis’
farm, only 12 of the 120 natives eligible
went to town to have their first legal
drink. About two - thirds of all the
adults in the division stayed firmly on
the wagon.
During the three-month “indoctrina-
tion” Native Welfare men’s elaborate
instructions on the etiquette of drinking
were taken with a why-all-the-fuss atti-
tude. And critics from both sides
those who said the laws were inade-
quate, and the country people who fore-
cast dire troubles—have been silenced.
Perhaps the best ndication of the
scheme's success has been in the reaction
to attempts to block the new rights. A
handful of publicans in the south of
the State either refused to serve the
Aborigines or segregated them in separ-
ate bars. It is felt this discrimination
will die of shame.
There were problems, of course. The
“West Australian” made an unfortunate
choice when it front-paged a Narrogin
trio of copybook natives having their
first round of beers. One later finished
the night, along with a dozen others, in
the town's lock-up; another was in hos-
pital with a knife wound, the result of
a drunken brawl on the town’s native
reserve.
NEW LABOR LAW
ffiJiulCetCn
Saturday, August 9, 1884
Woe is upon the land—the Banana-
land we mean. The new
“cullered” labour law comes into
force on Ist September, on and after
which date the first families, who now
give a tone to their afternoon drives
by perching blacking-bottle Apollos
in the stern of their “kerridges”, will
have to drop the luxury. Touching
the plantation trouble, the evidence
given by the “boys” at the recent
fnquiry, when thoroughly boiled
down, resolves itself into three
grievances, viz., “Too littee ki-ki, too
muchee work, an’ sposee Kanaka no
plentee work, boss come along and
kick him behind till make ’im nose
bleed.”
The two leading Freethinkers in
New Zealand Messrs. Stout
and Vallance have been returned
to the House of Representatives by
thumping majorities. Both gentle-
men are almost sure to be included
in the new Government.

FRONTS
Peace Battle Breaks
Out Again
The old familiar faces
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
TED HILL
Reactivator
The campaign for “The Australian
Congress for International Co-
operation and Disarmament”, to be held
in Sydney from October 25 to 30, be-
gins to gather momentum and problems.
Astute use of public unease at
France’s proposal to test nuclear wea-
pons in the Pacific gained quick en-
dorsement for the congress by all the
major Labor councils, the ACTU, and
a large number of provisional sponsors.
But, as the old familiar fellow-travelling
faces which had guided to such
notoriety the original Australian Peace
Council and its child, the Australian and
New Zealand Congress for Disarma-
ment, began to reappear, many of the
sponsors had second thoughts.
The Convening Committee met on
July 12 to elect the National Committee
which is now responsible for organising
the congress. Elected chairman was
Dr A. Lawes, who has been active in
other peace groups. Joint secretaries
are Mrs P. Latona and Mr G. Ander-
son, the latter a joint secretary of the
NSW Peace Committee, who attended
the last meeting of the World Peace
Council. The four vice-chairmen are
the Rev. A. B. Brand (member of the
World Peace Council and NSW Peace
Committee), Mrs M. Holmes (Union
of Australian Women), Mr J. Heffernan
(Federal Secretary of the Sheet Metal
Workers’ Union and Executive member
of NSW ALP), and Mr E. Wheelwright
(lecturer in economics and ALP mem-
ber).
Joint treasurers are Mr D. Allen
(NSW Peace Committee) and Mr Sam
Goldbloom, who was organising secre-
tary of the 1959 Peace Congress. It
was this congress which, Professor Mc-
Mahon Ball said, was initiated by the
Communists, who were doing most of
the hard organising work. Mr Gold-
bloom was the centre of a controversy
in Victoria in 1956 when he applied to
rejoin the ALP. He was accused by
two ALP members of being a member
of the Communist Party between 1952
and 1956. The ALP exonerated Mr
Goldbloom.
Among the committee members are
union officials Mr C. Fitzgibbon (WWF)
and Mr Ivo Lancaster (NSW Teachers’
Federation), clergymen, students, ex-
Communists such as Miss Helen Palmer
(Editor of “Outlook”), and Communists
such as Mr W. Parkinson (Miners’
Federation and Communist Central
Committee member). With all respect
to the good intentions of the foregoing,
the proposed congress appears to be
completely CP-manipulated.
Original plans were drawn up at a
meeting of the Communist-front World
Peace Council held in Poland last year.
Australia was represented by such well-
known “peace” figures as the Rev. Frank
Hartley, Lady Jessie Street, Mr G. An-
derson and CPA Central Committee
member Mrs Freda Brown. Sydney was
chosen for the congress venue as it was
considered there would be less likelihood
of organised opposition there than in
Melbourne. Fear of organised disrup-
tion caused committee members to
quietly drop the words “New Zealand”
from the original title. It was obvious
from similar events overseas that any
delegation from a country with a
Peking-inclined Communist Party would
set out either to take over the proceed-
ings or to wreck them.
But this has only complicated matters.
Ted Hill now plans to reactivate the
Peace Liaison Committee for the Asian
and Pacific Regions. Formed in 1952
with the Rev. Victor James, an original
APC member, as a prime mover, this
committee had lapsed as Chinese tactics
grew harsher. Now it can be used
again and James, twice a recent visitor
to China and a prominent member of
the Australia-China Friendship Society,
is just the man to guide it.
In April an exploratory meeting was
held in James’ Unitarian Church,
Melbourne. Those in attendance give
some idea of the potential of this re-
vived “peace” group. The large gather-
ing included Messrs T. Innis (Victorian
ALP Executive), N. Gallagher (General
Secretary, Builders’ Laborers’ Federa-
tion), T. Bull (Assistant Secretary, WWF)
and H. Danaher (President, Builders’
Laborers).
There is some speculation as to how
much “peace and goodwill” there will
be, should the two groups clash.
EDUCATION
Victorian Teachers’
Disappointing Poll
A retiring age for the tribunal?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
T\espite the paper war conducted by
” candidates and the three unions
backing them, there was a disappointing
poll in the Victorian Teachers’ Tribunal
election. About 26,000 ballot papers
were posted out, but only 16,028 teachers
and trainee teachers sent in valid votes.
They were voting to elect the teachers’
representative on the three-man tribunal
which fixes salaries and conditions in
the State education system. The other
two members are a Government rep-
resentative and an independent chair-
man.
The retiring teachers’ delegate, Mr
Doug Brown, had an absolute majority
of 372 over the other six candidates.
Mr Brown, who was backed by the Vic-
torian Teachers’ Union, received 8201
votes. Second place went to another
candidate endorsed by the VTU, Mr
George Lawson, with 5237 votes.
The candidate supported by the Vic-
torian Secondary Teachers’ Association,
Mr R. O. Desailly, finished third with
1597 votes. Candidates put up by the
Affiliated Teachers’ Union polled less
than a thousand votes between them,
Brown has been teachers’ delegate
ever since the tribunal was set up in
1946. Although he had a good win it
was not on the same crushing scale as
he has had in some of the six previous
elections. The VTU gave its endorse-
ment impartially to Brown and Lawson,
One reason the latter polled so well is
that Brown has turned 65 and many
teachers felt that their delegate should
be subject to the same retiring age as
themselves.
Lawson is regarded as being more
sympathetic to the special claims of
secondary teachers than Brown, and
this won him many votes from this
section of the service. It also explains
the surprisingly low vote for Desailly
whose campaigning was pitched at the
secondary teacher vote.


The VTU-endorsed candidates also
scored in the election for a deputy-rep-
resentative. Again it endorsed impartially
two candidates, Mr John Harris, who
topped the poll with 6404 votes, and Mr
P. Dwyer who came second with 5225.
The result of the poll will increase
secondary teacher discontent with the
tribunal. Had Lawson been elected,
some of the edge might have been taken
off this, but Brown’s seventh consecutive
term is anything but a pleasing result
to the VSTA.

COUNTRY
Tasmania’s Unpredictable
Politics
A hungry eye on Cole's Senate seat
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
SENATOR COLE
Threatened
Federal Country Party has little
prospect of a good return from its
heavy investment in the Tasmanian
branch. The party came into existence
in the island early last year and was un-
prepared for the November Federal
election. No candidate was endorsed.
But a flock of eager Country Party
nominees came up for the State election
in May—and got a terrible hiding. Now,
with a Senate election in the offing, the
party is in agonising internal convulsions.
Victory in the Senate poll, the political
watchers have declared, was well within
the power of the Country Party if it
chose a good candidate and insinuated
him among the Liberal voters. Two
Liberals, two Labor senators and George
Cole (DLP) come out this time. A
two-two Lib-Lab split is certain, but
everyone has an eye on Cole’s seat.
It was that seat and the prospect of
increasing its Senate representation by
one which encouraged the Federal chiefs
of the Country Party to invade Tasmania,
a notoriously unpredictable political
arena. Early reports were good, especially
as anti-Labor forces were dispirited by
nearly 30 years of Opposition.
Stan Huntingdon, former Liberal Party
organiser, was hired by the CP to whip
up the branches. He was told that 30
would have to be in existence before
Federal Leader John McEwen could give
his patronage to the party’s first State
conference. Huntingdon got his 30
branches, with some to spare.
C. R. Best, who had been a Liberal
MHA until he resigned and became an
Independent MLC, was first party presi-
dent. He sought and got leave of ab-
sence before the State election, but re-
turned to the chair later. He immedi-
ately came into collision with Hunting-
don, whose appointment was terminated
at an angry meeting. Ern Reynolds,
who had acted as State president while
Best was on leave, resigned in protest.
At this stage Federal president W. L.
Moss intervened. The Federal Executive
put it to Best that he would have to
resign if he would not give allegiance
to the party and sit as aCP MLC. Best
said he would quit the presidency.
The State Executive is now to call a
special State conference to “consolidate
the position of the party”. The concili-
atory Mr Moss told members: “Some-
times a bit of a row does you good.”
But this row is not settled. Best sup-
porters are likely to nominate one of
their group to contest the presidency
against Reynolds—and Huntingdon’s
position is not resolved.
SPORT
The Ailing Game
Overwritten , overtelevised
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
llfiTH an air of surprise the NSW
Cricket Association has discovered
that it loses about £9OOO on each Shef-
field Shield match in Sydney.
Many things ail cricket in general,
only some of them peculiar to the game
in NSW. Most of all, the people in
cricket who profess to love the game
are its worst enemies.
Within a few years the Tests could
be as costly as Shield games. The West
Indies visits will be profitable, but the
dour Australia-England battles will draw
fewer and fewer people.
For a sport heading towards unim-
portance cricket is overwritten, and over-
exposed on television. These things do
not help to keep cricket popular, they
emphasise its dullness and create that
definite aversion which too much pub-
licity will always bring to an intrinsically-
poor product, or an outdated one. This
is one of the main things wrong with
cricket and only less publicity, keyed
to cricket’s value on the day, or “better”
cricket can reverse the effects.
Better cricket would not be the same
as “good” cricket. It might include
Friday to Monday matches in Shield,
with the rules adjusted to ensure the
always - promised, seldom - delivered
brighter cricket. It could include cater-
ing and refreshment facilities roughly
1000 per cent better than any cricket
ground now offers. And it might well
include higher admission charges for
fewer people in greater comfort.

1. The Stars in Their Courses
Building a 150-inch telescope in Australia
By SIR RICHARD WOOLLEY, Astronomer Royal
The Southern Hemisphere has been
an object of interest to astrono-
mers for a very long time, but it is
now more so than ever before. Early
interest was inspired by a desire to fill
in the unknown. You cannot see the far
Southern constellations like the Southern
Cross from anywhere in Europe or the
United States of America, and so long
as astronomers were mainly engaged in
mapping the sky rather than in arguing
about the nature of what was there,
once they had mapped it, they went
Southwards mainly to complete their
map. For example Halley, best known
for his work on the comet which bears
his name, went to the island of Ascen-
sion to map the Southern constellations,
in the day of Isaac Newton, and a
century later the younger Herschel spent
some years at the Cape completing his
father’s survey of the nebulae. The
science has, of course, progressed and
the mapping is now far more sophisti-
cated and whatever progress is made in
the North should be repeated in the
South. But there is much more in it than
usual. The Southern Hemisphere is much
the more interesting, astronomically, of
the two. This is a matter of chance
there is no particular connection between
our Northern and Southern geographical
hemispheres and the structure of the
heavens, except with chance: and it
turns out that the Southern Hemisphere
has the preponderance (sometimes al-
most a monopoly) of objects of especial
interest to contemporary astronomers.
To see this clearly one must form an
idea of the galaxy. If you go out of
doors on a moonless night, in a spot
well away from street lights, and wait
for a few minutes until your eyes get
“dark adapted” you can see the Milky
Way very plainly overhead in the even-
ings at this time of the year. It goes
through the Southern Cross. In this
hemisphere there are a large number of
brighter stars to be seen near it, es-
pecially to the Western side of the
Southern Cross. This great and conspicu-
ous band of light, with its associated
stars, is crossed with dark markings.
There is one near the Southern Cross
which is called the Coal Sack; and in-
deed this dark coal sack forms the head
of a large dark constellation picked out
by the aborigines, who called it The
Emu or so I am told. What is import-
ant is that the entire Milky Way is an
enormous flattened system of stars, of

We on the earth go round our Sun
once a year, and the Sun itself, with its
attendant planets, describes an enormous
orbit round and round the Milky Way—
or, as we prefer to say, round the centre
of this galaxy. It is probable that the Sun
takes 200,000,000 years to get once
round the galaxy.

an attempt to account for the mechanics
of this galaxy, and, even more boldly,
to sketch its history. To do this, they
must make use of recent advances in
nuclear physics because they cannot in-
terpret all the facts about the evolution
of the galaxy unless they have some
idea about the evolution of a single star.
You may still not see the connection
with nuclear physics. It is this. At the
centre of every star there is a nuclear
reaction a non-stop hydrogen bomb,
if you like, which supplies the star with
all its energy. All our energy on earth
comes from the Sun, and therefore from
the nuclear reaction at the centre of the
Sun. But a star will burn up its hydrogen,
in time, and when it does so, it has to
start up a different nuclear reaction
burning something else. We do not, of
course, see the centres of the stars, but
we do argue (successfully, we hope)
what the nuclear reactions must be to
account for the observed surface charac-
teristics of the stars. Well, then; why the
interest in the South? There are three
very good reasons that occur to me, and
no doubt other astronomers whose in-
terests are not quite the same as mine
would give you some others. My three
reasons are these:
• The centre of the galaxy lies in the
Southern Hemisphere.
• Most of the globular star clusters
lie in the Southern Hemisphere and
• The Magellanic Clouds lie very far
South.
One of the absorbing questions about
the centre of the galaxy is the question:
how far off is it from here? When I first
started to do astronomy, many astrono-
mers would hardly hazard a guess, but
now we think that it must be between
20,000 and 25,000 light years. Now the
centre passes nearly overhead in Can-
berra and is low down near the Southern
horizon even from Southern California,
so that Australian telescopes have a much
better chance of finding out the facts
about this important region than have
American ones: and,
in particular, of
finding its distance.
The globular clusters
are great aggrega-
tions of a hundred
thousand or more
stars. They present
many fascinating
problems. A crude
one is why do not
the stars all fall to-
gether into a heap at the centre, and the
crude answer is, they are all of them
describing orbits in the cluster. From
the point of view of evolution, the valu-
able property of a star cluster is that
(roughly speaking) all the stars are the
same age and as the globulars appear
to be very old they contain, as it were,
fossil stars. Of the 80 or so known
globular clusters in our galaxy, the 10
closest ones are in the Southern Hemi-
sphere.
Now we come to the Magellanic
Clouds. You can see these for yourself.
Again on a moonless night, with no
street lamp, look towards the South on
a summer evening. You should see two
faint and distant clouds they could
deceive you into thinking that they really
were actual clouds in our own atmos-
phere. But they are not. They are two
complete galaxies in their own right,
somewhat smaller than ours, but with
their own populations of stars and even
their own globular clusters. They are
much closer than any galaxy (outside
our own) that can be seen from the
North in fact, they are a mere half a
million light years away. Again we
want to study the mechanics, the history
of these two smallish galaxies, and we
know already that this study will throw
light on the study of our own galaxy,
They are so far South that they are
quite invisible from California.
Telescope-wise (as they themselves
would say) the Californians possess by
far the most important State in the
world. I mean true telescopes and not
radio-telescopes: a word about them
later. The world’s largest telescope is the
200-inch diameter reflector on Mt
Palomar and there are now others of
100 inches or more in California. In our
entire Southern Hemisphere the largest
telescopes are of diameter 74 inches
one on Mt Stromlo, ACT, and the others
in Victoria. Outside of California there
are about a dozen telescopes in the
North bigger than this. And so, not only
is the Southern Hemisphere more inter-
esting than the Northern Hemisphere,
but in addition it has far less telescope
power than the other. It follows that the
opportunity for astronomers who can
put up large telescopes in the Southern
Hemisphere is immense.
Before going on to describe the actual
steps taken to enlist
suitable support for
a giant Anglo-Aus-
tralian telescope, let
us look at two
points. Why do you
want a giant tele-
scope, and what
about the radio-tele-
scopes? On the first
point, the larger the
diameter of a tele-
scope, the more light you can gather
with it. You can see the Magellanic
Clouds with your naked eye, but you
can't see the individual stars in them,
as you can with the help of a telescope,
Actually the astronomer seldom looks,
instead he photographs, or uses a photo-
electric cell. With a 74-inch telescope
it takes you an hour to photograph a
star one hundred times as bright in-
trinsically as the Sun, but situated in
one of the clouds. No one has ever
photographed a star in the clouds so
faint as our Sun. Naturally we are
handicapped if our knowledge is con-
fined to excessively bright stars, and in
fact the astronomers who have worked
with these 74-inch telescopes to the limit
of their capacity have no difficulty in
writing down programmes of very great
interest that could only be tackled with
a much larger telescope,
Then what about the great radio-tele-
scopes? They are hundreds of feet, not
hundreds of inches, in diameter. But of
course they don’t collect ordinary light,
but they collect radio waves. Now it is
true that Australia is specially prominent
in radio astronomy, far out of proportion
to its population. Long may this con-
tinue. But although the radio astronomer
and the optical astronomer use quite


This we change.

This we don't
Now you can see for yourself where we
make most of our changes. Way down
deep.
Most of the parts you can see (and
most of the parts you can’t see) have
been changed again and again and again.
But we never change the Volkswagen
without a reason. And the only reason
is to make it work even better.
When we do make a change, we try to
make the new part fit older models, too.
So you’ll find that many VW parts are in-
terchangeable from one year to the next.
Which is one of the reasons why VW
parts are so inexpensive.
And why VW service is as good as it is.
The same principle holds good for the
beetle shape.
We made the rear window bigger one
year so you could see other people bet-
ter. We made the tail lights bigger last
year so other people could see you better.
But nothing drastic. Any Volkswagen
bonnet still fits any VW ever made. So
does any mudguard.
And, in case you hadn’t noticed, every
Volkswagen still looks like every other
Volkswagen.
Which is one of the
nicest things of
all about the car.
It doesn’t go in one year

different means of asking questions of
Nature, they are ultimately asking the
same kind of question if they both ask
her, what is our galaxy like now? And
what is its history? So the Australian
radio astronomer must have his cook
complimented by some Southern optical
astronomer, when the radio observations
refer to the far Southern objects. With
all these considerations in mind, many
informal conversations have been held
about the possibility of putting up a
new large optical telescope in Australia.
These have crystallised into the found-
ation of regular committees by the Royal
Society, in London, and by the Australian
Academy of Science in Canberra, to en-
quire into means of erecting a telescope
of 150 inches diameter to be set up in
the best possible site in Australia and to
be paid for and operated on a half share
basis by the two nations. This scheme
is at present sponsored by these two
learned societies, and has not at present
received any firm promise of financial
support from either Government. The
scientists themselves, however, are con-
vinced that their case is very strong in-
deed and are therefore very hopeful
that Government support will not be long
delayed. In the meantime they are hold-
ing very detailed discussions on the
design of the proposed telescope, and
on the choice of a site.

population, living in a large country
which is by no means an easy one to

ard of living by close attention to engi-
neering and technology. Nor has it been
unaware that attention to pure science
helps create a healthy technology. For
this and other reasons Australian sup-
port of both radio and optical astronomy
has been at a very high level and the
results have redounded to Australia’s
scientific credit.
It is greatly to be hoped that Austra-
lian astronomers will be enabled to go
into partnership with their English
counterparts, who are, after all, the heirs
of Newton and of and that an
Anglo-Australian telescope will be built
within the next decade with which many
secrets of the galaxy and of the Magel-
lanic Clouds will be unlocked.
2. The Distant Mystery
Of 3C 273
or , Australia’s diligent radio astronomers at work
By S. T. BUTLER
(Professor of Theoretical Physics, University of Sydney)
Man’s concept of the Universe is in
a state of revolution. A revolu-
tion triggered not by the sudden
firing of the first Sputnik in 1957 or by
manned and unmanned excursions into
space that followed, but by a series of
discoveries made with bigger and better
astronomical instruments in the two
short decades since World War 11.
We have always looked at the stars —
ever since the dawn of history. But
only since Galileo Galilei in Italy first
used the invention of a Dutch spectacle-
maker and fitted two lenses in a tube in
1609 did the world use instruments to
explore the heavens. After that, dis-
covery followed discovery for the next
three centuries until early in our cen-
tury the construction of very large opti-
cal telescopes opened new vistas and
once again caused great turmoil in
astronomical thought.
It was only then that an astonished
world learned to
think and see be-
yond the stars of
the Milky Way, our
own cluster of stars,
to the countless dis-
tant and fast reced-
ing other clusters of
stars, known gener-
ally as galaxies.
What is a galaxy?
A galaxy consists
of a very extensive system of stars and
gas in the form of a disc and our Milky
Way seems to be a typical example.
Our sun is near the edge of the disc
forming our own galaxy. Today we also
“see” by radio far into a new and fasci-
nating sky populated by what we call
radio stars. A number of these inappro-
priately named objects are galaxies,
some near, some far and some at greater
distances than optical telescopes can
normally penetrate. We do not know
what the majority of these objects are.
Are they galaxies at distances so great
that the light from them is too weak to
detect, holding in their radio signals
cosmological information from the re-
motest parts of the universe, from the
remotest past? Modern astronomy will
provide at least some of the answers and
Australia is in the very forefront of this
research.
In fact the science of radio-astronomy
was virtually unknown until Australians
started to develop it after World War II
in conjunction with groups at Man-
chester and Cambridge Universities,
The sudden post-war effort in this field
was a direct result of war-time radar
jams and periods of disturbances. It
was in February, 1942, in the middle of
World War II when scores of radar
operators throughout Britain reported a
new form of radar jamming which no
one could explain and no routine
counter-measures could alleviate.
Scientists found that particularly heavy
sunspot activity at the time and associ-
ated solar flares were causing emission
of a continuous jumble of radio signals
from the sun.
This was confirmed when radar sets
automatically returned to normal as solar
flare activity decreased. But the discovery
was not entirely new.
Immediately after
the war scientists
began looking at the
universe at radio
wavelengths, with
large radio receivers
called radio - tele-
scopes. The first of
these were built by
Cambridge Univer-
sity, Manchester
University and the
Australian Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR) now called
the Commonwealth Scientific and In-
dustrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)
Radio Physics Laboratory in Sydney. So
successful were these centres, and others
that have mushroomed since then, that
by now we can learn almost as much
about the universe by “listening” to it
as by looking at it.
Why do stars produce a radio noise?
One of the reasons is the same reason
that a star emits light—it is hot. The
ordinary light bulb gives light when a
thin tungsten filament is heated to white
heat by an electric current. The elec-
tricity is used purely to produce the
high temperature required, and the
white-hot filament then produces the
light. Similarly, a star is a tremendously
hot object, whose heat is produced by
the natural nuclear reactions continu-

ously proceeding within it. These reac-
tions, like the electricity feeding the bulb,
produce the necessary heat. A very hot
object emits light because the heat makes
its atoms move faster and collide with
one another more frequently and more
severely than in the normal, cool state.
When the structure of atoms is inter-
fered with by such augmented collisions,
the atoms emit what is called electro-
magnetic radiation. Or when the tem-
perature is so high that the atoms them-
selves disintegrate into their constituent
particles, the violent motion primarily of
the so-called electrons cause them to
emit electro-magnetic radiation.
Certain wavelengths of this radiation
stimulate our vision and are what we see
as light rays (waves). Other, longer
wavelengths of this radiation, though
invisible, stimulate our senses and feel
warm. They are “heat” or infra-red
rays. Shorter wavelengths than the
visible ones are ultra-violet rays and
longer ones than the infra-red are what
we know as radio waves.
Oadio waves produce no reaction to our
** senses, and we can detect them only
with artificially produced apparatus such
as radio receivers. Now, the filament of
a light bulb is so chosen because it pro-
duces mainly visible radiation plus only
some infra-red. But the complicated
mass of hot gases that form a star pro-
duces radiation of a tremendous variety
of frequencies from ultra-violet to radio
waves. We can therefore often not
only see a star, but also “hear” it.
Planets themselves do not emit radio
waves. But if in their atmosphere there
are regions of sufficiently high tempera-
tures these regions can and do emit such
waves, even though the temperatures are
not high enough for the emission of
very strong light waves. It is clear that
the broiling masses of stars do not lend
themselves to the emission of clear radio
waves of one pure frequency or wave-
length, but emit a whole host of fre-
quencies. This is what is called radio
noise. Radio noise can be caused not
only by the temperature effect in and
around a star, but also by the star’s
magnetic field. Radio noise caused by a
magnetic field is particularly increased
in times of flare activity of the surface
of the star (sun); and it was radio emis-
sions caused by this effect that produced
Britain’s spectacular radar “blackout”
during the war in 1942.
And even at great distances from
stars there are often magnetic effects
capable of producing radio noise. These
effects in particular may prove critical
in providing a clue about how galaxies
are formed and, indeed, to the origin of
the universe itself.

scope look like and how does it work?
The conventional radio-telescope, deve-
loped after the war and used almost
exclusively ever since, was patterned
after the reflecting mirrors used in opti-
cal telescopes. The reflecting mirrors of
optical telescopes have exactly the oppo-
site function to the metallic reflectors in
the headlights of a car or a searchlight.
These reflect the light from one point
and throw it out in a beam; in an optical
telescope similar parabolic mirrors of
high perfection collect the light beam
from a star and focus it on a point.
Enter the Mills Cross
Tn a radio-telescope the same reflect-
ing principle is used by a parabolic re-
flecting mesh (in place of the mirror)
which “collects” radio signals from space
and focuses them by reflection on to a
central aerial. While the world's largest
optical telescope at Mt Palomar in
California has a mirror 200 inches in
diameter, an antennae of such a size
would be far too small for a radio-tele-
scope.
Because radio waves are much longer
in wavelength than light waves, and are
much weaker (coming from far distant
regions in space), a much larger area is
needed to “collect” them. This is why
radio astronomers have been building
larger and larger antennae dishes for
the telescopes. Until recently the world's
largest such telescopes were the famous
250 ft dish of Manchester University at
Jodrell Bank in England, and the more
recent 210 ft dish built by the CSIRO at
Parkes, NSW. The largest dish in the
world now is 1000 ft in diameter. It
has just been completed in Puerto Rico
for Cornell University, USA, at a cost
of nearly 10 million dollars.
But although Australia has never been
able to muster millions for radio astro-
nomy she has been a leader in this re-
search even before World War 11. It
is only fair to recall that even before
the importance of this new science was
fully appreciated, important preparatory
work was done in Australia by Sir John
Madsen and Dr D. F. Martyn.
In 1946, Dr E. G. Bowen, head of the
CSIRO Radio-Physics Laboratory, as-
signed a team of twelve to research in
radio-astronomy under Dr J. L. Pawsey.
Starting with little equipment and
limited finance they proceeded to devise
many remarkable innovations that sur-
prised members of the international
radio research body, the Union Radio-
Scientifique Internationale. In 1952 the
10th General Assembly of the URSI was
held in Sydney. It was the first time that
any of the 10 international scientific
unions had met outside Europe or North
America.
Australian Bernard Mills, a CSIRO
scientist, was already a leading authority,
and the “horizontal interferometer” built
to his design at Badgery’s Creek, near
Sydney, had even then discovered 77
“radio stars”, or mysterious sources of
cosmic radio noise. The giant optical
telescope at Mt Palomar was later able
to pick out faint smudges at some of the
positions located by the Mills equipment.
Today Dr Mills is an acknowledged
world authority in radio astronomy and a
vital figure in the Chatterton Astronomy
Department of the School of Physics of
Sydney University which he has since
joined.
In fact the Chatterton Department of
the School of Physics has in recent years
emerged as one of the world's main con-
centrations of radio astronomers. With
the financial aid of the Nuclear Research
Foundation within the University of Syd-
ney and of the British and, mainly, the
United States Governments, the Chatter-
ton Astronomy Department has built
two unique astronomical instruments.
These two instruments —one a giant
cross-shaped radio-telescope near Can-
berra and the other a stellar intensity
interferometer built at Narrabri, 350
miles north-west of Sydney—are com-
manding world-wide interest and respect.
The instrument at the Molonglo Radio
Observatory at Hoskinstown near Can-
berra is being built by Dr Mills, now a
Fellow of the Royal Society. Dr Mills
had the revolutionary idea that a radio-
telescope need not have the same shape
as an optical one. The telescope he in-
vented, and which has been named the
Mills Cross after him, has its aerials in
two narrow, long arms crossing at right
angles on level ground. First perfected
by Dr Mills at Fleurs near Sydney in
1954, this system has proved very suc-
cessful in the study of cosmic radio noise
from remote parts of the universe.
The sensitivity of a radio-telescope
depends on its area, whereas the fine
detail it can “see” in the sky depends on
its diameter. By building two arms in the
form of a cross a very large diameter
is obtained. The width of the arms is
chosen so that the sensitive area is suffi-
cient and in this way an economical and
powerful telescope is exactly matched to
the astronomical problem. The Mills
Cross near Canberra when completed
next year will be one of the world’s most
powerful astronomical instruments.
With support from the Nuclear Re-
search Foundation and a grant of three-
quarters of a million dollars from the
US Government's National Science
Foundation the major construction work
on the new instrument has already been
finished. Each arm of the new Cross is
a cylindrical paraboloid reflector 40ft
wide and one mile long. The construc-
tion represents a considerable achieve-
ment in civil engineering and test sur-
veys show that the foundations are laid
to within a quarter of an inch of the
true positions and that the steel work
maintains the parabolic shape to within
one inch in all positions.
The east-west arm will collect all
radiation from a fine strip of the sky.
The other arm will collect all the radia-
tion from a similar strip at right angles.
By combining the signals collected by
the two arms in a special way only the
radiation from the point of intersection
of the two strips will be recorded. And
with multiple receiving systems the tele-
scope will look in many adjacent direc-
tions at the same time thereby exploiting
a time-saving facility for
efficiency.
1,000,000 cosmic measurements
information from the telescope—in
A one night nearly one million separate
measurements of the cosmic radio emis-
sion are collected —will be recorded on
magnetic tape and transferred to Sydney
and processed in the new high-speed
electronic computer in the Basser Com-
puting Department of the School of
Physics.
It is planned to use the east-west arm
—by itself a powerful radio-telescope—
for research on radio sources in the
Milky Way and nearby galaxies while
work on the feed-system and meshing of
the north-south arm still proceeds. When
the second arm is complete the sensi-
tivity and resolution of the Mills Cross
will provide the School of Physics of the
University of Sydney with one of the
most powerful astronomical instruments
for probing the depths of the universe.
Being unique in the Southern Hemi-
sphere it is expected to play a vital role
in the study of the nearby galaxies
known as the Magellanic Clouds, in the
study of the centre of our Milky Way,
and in identifying the thousands of
mysterious radio stars.
The second major instrument at the
Chatterton Astronomy Department of
the School of Physics is the Stellar In-
tensity Interferometer which has been
built by its inventor, Professor Robert
Hanbury Brown, FRS, at Narrabri in
NSW. Completed in June last year,
Narrabri Observatory, the field station


—established with the help of the
Nuclear Research Foundation, the UK
Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research and the US Air Force—for the
Stellar Intensity Interferometer, is by
now well known in scientific circles
throughout the world because of the
great interest this unique instrument has
created.
The inventor of the instrument, Pro-
fessor Hanbury Brown, formerly of the
famous Jodrell Bank Observatory of
Manchester University, has come to Aus-
tralia and is now Professor of Astro-
nomy in the Sydney School of Physics.
Two questions
interferometer, whose components
A were built under contract by firms
in Britain, Italy, and Australia, has been
designed to study the 200 brightest stars
in the sky and to answer the questions:
How large are these stars?
How hot are they?
For many stars astronomers have ob-
tained answers to these questions already.
By using ordinary telescopes they can
estimate a star's temperature from its
color. Then, knowing a star’s tempera-
ture and the total amount of light we
receive from it in, say, one second, they
can calculate the size of the star. This
is the method by which all information
about such stars has so far been gained.
Size and heat are of crucial importance
to scientists as they are the very founda-
tions on which is based our understand-
ing of the evolution of a star.
But this method has disadvantages,
which are principally that the tempera-
ture can be estimated only approxi-
mately from the star’s color, and that
this estimate is reliable only for rela-
tively “cool'’ stars. For “hot” stars the
method is too inaccurate to be valuable.
(A “hot" star has a surface tempera-
ture above about 20,000 degrees Fahren-
heit and a “cold” star below 20,000
degrees. The sun with surface tempera-
ture of about 11,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
is classified as a “cold” star.)
Thus there are many stars about
which astronomers have only very in-
accurate information. It is true that the
temperature of a star can be accurately
calculated if its size and the amount of
light it emits are known and some people
might argue that both these should be
easily available—the amount of light is
readily measurable and the size can be
obtained from the viewing angle.
This would be so, were it not for the
fact that to measure the size of the 200
brightest stars in the sky we would have
to do the equivalent of measuring the
diameter of a penny from 4000 miles
away. And this would need a telescope
with a lens 500 feet across, whereas the
largest telescope man has so far suc-
ceeded in making is the Mount Palomar
telescope with a diameter of 200 inches.
It can therefore be readily appreciated
how valuable the Narrabri Stellar Inten-
sity Interferometer is. This instrument
in fact does measure the angular size of
the star directly, and in this sense does
the job of a 500 ft telescope.
To give an idea of the resolving power
of the instrument —it will measure
angles of less than 1/1000th second of
arc, less than the angle subtended in
Sydney by a threepenny piece in Perth.
However, while the interferometer can
measure the size of the “hot” stars which
can’t be measured now by telescope
observation, this instrument, too, will
have its limits.
The stars it measures have to be
“bright”, either because they are “hot” or
because they are relatively close. To
measure stars which are not bright,
either because they are “cold” or are
very remote, a bigger and more powerful
interferometer will have to be built.
But that is for the future. The new
instrument at Narrabri will certainly
bring in important scientific information
about 200 bright stars which at the
moment we can’t measure.
The Narrabri interferometer consists
of two 24ft parabolic mirrors each made
up of 252 small hexagonal glass mirrors
which fit together like the cells of a
honeycomb. The two mirrors are
mounted on trucks on a circular railway
line, 600 feet in diameter. How does
the interferometer work?
To begin with, any source of steadily
shining light never puts out an abso-
lutely constant stream of light. The
stream of light fluctuates in intensity so
rapidly and so minutely that the fluctu-
ations cannot be discerned by the human
eye. But they can readily be detected
by electronic equipment. There are
millions of such intensity fluctuations
each second and they occur in a com-
pletely random manner—meaning that
there is no regularity about them.
First, these fluctuations in light inten-
sity are measured by the electronic
equipment of the interferometer with
the mirrors together. The fluctuations
are then closely related, or almost the
same. As the mirrors are moved apart
on the railway line the relationship or
correlation between the fluctuations
measured by the two mirrors changes
and is eventually lost. The rate at which
this correlation is lost as the mirrors are
moved apart is measured electronically
and plotted on a graph.
The graph readings are applied to an
equation, and the solution to the equa-
tion gives the size of the star. From
the star's size its temperature can also be
calculated.
A striking example of the kind of
brain-power assembled in Australia in
the field of astronomy was given recently
when a scientist of the Chatterton
Astronomy Department of the School of
Physics made a discovery of very great
magnitude by using the CSIRO radio
telescope at Parkes. The discovery
which led to the finding of objects in
deepest space more than a million times
more massive than our sun was made a
year ago by Dr Cyril Hazard, a mem-
ber of Professor Hanbury Brown's inter-
ferometer group at Narrabri. So im-
portant was Dr Hazard's discovery that
he was recently offered and accepted a
professorship in the Radio Astronomy
and Space Research Centre at Cornell
University, headed by famous astrono-
mer and cosmologist Professor Thomas
Gold.
Dr Hazard's work arose from a claim
by radio astronomers that their instru-
ments could detect objects more distant
in space than even the 200-inch tele-
scope at Mount Palomar was able to see.
Optical astronomers, however, have for
long pointed out that this was not
necessarily so. They said they might
well be able to see such objects if only
radio astronomers could pinpoint their
radio sources in the heavens accurately
enough for optical instruments to pick
them up without a lengthy and laborious
search.
New method
TAr Hazard developed a method of pin-
pointing radio sources in the heavens
with superb accuracy. He began his
work at the giant Jodrell Bank radio
telescope of Manchester University in
England and in 1962 joined Sydney
University’s School of Physics to work
on its intensity interferometer at Narra-
bri. In addition he was granted per-
mission by the CSIRO to use its new
radio-telescope at Parkes to continue
his original work.
Dr Hazard’s method of pinpointing
radio sources is applicable only to
sources which can be eclipsed by the
moon, whose position at a given moment
is therefore known with high precision.
By picking up the radio emission of a
particular source as it moved into and
out of eclipse, Dr Hazard obtained a
detailed radio pattern, the analysis of
which yielded the position of the object
with great accuracy. It also gave the
angular size of the source, a measure-
ment radio astronomers previously had
been unable to obtain.

measured by Dr Hazard with the CSIRO
parkes dish was just one of the vast
numbers of known and catalogued radio
sources in the skies. The official cata-
logue of radio sources lists this object
as 3C 273 —radio source No. 273 in the
third catalogue. With the publication of
the precise location of this radio source
optical astronomers had something defi-
nite to look at to see what this major
radio source actually looked like.
In the past when radio astronomers
referred to a certain radio source they
could give only such a broad location
that in general optical astronomers
would see quite a number of possible
objects in this range, and thus could not
identify the source indicated by the
radio astronomers. It was for this
reason that, except in isolated instances,
the radio astronomers’ catalogue of
radio sources had not been identified by
the optical astronomers, and the two
fields optical and radio astronomy
worked more or less parallel rather than
together.
The first observation
Immediately Dr Hazard’s location of
3C 273 was published astronomers at
the giant Mt Palomar telescope decided
to see what it looked like. On first ob-
servation it looked just like a normal
star of our own galaxy—an object which
would never have singled itself out for
any special observations. However,
when photographs of the light spectrum
from the “star” were taken it became
clear that the star is not in our own
galaxy at all but is about 1500 million
light years away—a light year being the
distance light travels in one year at
a speed of 186,000 miles a second.
Thus the light we are seeing now from
this object has taken 1500 million years
to reach us.
By itself, the distance is not fantastic
because it is known that the universe
consists of large galaxies of stars extend-
ing out even beyond this distance. Our
own galaxy is typical of the galaxies of
the universe, containing some 100,000
million suns swirling in space like a
giant Catherine wheel. The diameter
of such a galaxy is something like a few
hundred thousand light years.
The strange thing about the new
object was therefore not its distance
directly; but that, knowing this distance
and its angular size, the actual size of
the object came out to be something
smaller than our solar system. Hence
it cannot be a distant galaxy.
It is one single sun-like object, yet so
bright that it is emitting more than 100
times more light than a typical entire
galaxy. Thus it is emitting more light
than 100,000 million suns. The inter-
pretation is that this single object con-
tains as much matter as 1,000,000 or
even more of our suns rolled into one.
Naturally these findings startled the
entire astronomy world because they did
not fit into the previous pattern of the
universe of stars, solar systems, galaxies
and inter-galactic gases.
But more was to come. Dr Hazard
himself continued pinpointing additional
radio sources and radio astronomers
elsewhere also have begun to do the
same. By now several additional radio
sources have been defined accurately
enough for investigation by the Mt Palo-
mar telescope. All these sources have
turned out to be the same type of strange
objects as 3C273. Each of these “tiny”
but distant objects is outshining an entire
galaxy of 100,000 million suns. More-
over, since every one of the major radio
sources thus pinpointed and investigated
has turned out to be one of these strange
new objects, it is highly probable that a
large percentage of the hundreds of
major radio sources catalogued also fall
in this new category.
Thus it would seem that one of the
most usual types of objects in the uni-
verse is something which astronomers
until now have missed entirely.
Their final interpretation of the new
objects may well throw considerable
light on the theories of the origin of the
universe.
The scientific importance of Dr
Hazard’s discovery is obvious. But it
is also as an illustration of the fact that
radio astronomy and optical astronomy
must go hand in hand if we want to
solve the major astronomical problems
that still puzzle us.* Australia today
has most of the wherewithal to tackle
this task including the background of
research, the brain-power and now also
most of the instruments. But while Aus-
tralia has pioneered and captured for it-
self a leading position in radio and
modern astronomy, the largest instru-
ment it possesses in the optical field is
the 74-inch telescope at Mt Stromlo.
Because of Australia’s geographical
position in the Southern Hemisphere it
is at an advantage in astronomical re-
search, and it would be a great pity if
Australia's instruments could not be
complemented by a large-scale optical
telescope. It is for this reason that
regular committees have been set up by
the Royal Society in London and the
Australian Academy of Science in Can-
berra to enquire into means of erecting
a giant optical telescope of 150 inches
diameter to be established in Australia.
*lt must be realised that only a small
percentage of radio sources pinpointed
by our instruments in the Southern
Hemisphere can be observed by the
optical telescopes of the Northern Hemi-
sphere.


OUT AND ABOUT
Latham: A Memoir
A sober thrush in a parrot’s cage
By M. H. ELLIS
J first met Sir John Latham in 1920,
during the course of a noted libel
action in which T. J. Ryan, lately
Premier of Queensland, sued the
“Hobart Mercury” for libel, as one of a
long series of actions in which Ryan
had vanquished most of the great news-
papers in Australia. The “Mercury”
had a strong bar and an enthusiastic
leader in F. E. Bryant, KC, a Queens-
lander who hated Ryan and was pre-
paring to fight all out to a victory—
which he won.
Bryant's juniors were Latham, fresh
back from the Peace Conference where
he had been on W. M. Hughes’ staff,
and Ted Reynolds, fresh back from the
war and afterwards leader of the Vic-
torian Bar. It was a pretty colorful set-
up all round. Latham looked somewhat
like a sober thrush that had strayed into
a parrot cage. He was severe, un-
smiling, grey of mien and garb. There
was an air about him as if he had rubbed
shoulders with Woodrow Wilson and a
bit of the President's coloring matter
had rubbed off on him. I first noticed
him particularly during an argument as
to whether a witness should be called
when he kept on interrupting Bryant
with polite and deprecatory interrup-
tions (“Might I suggest . . . May I be
permitted . . .”), until Bryant, a forth-
right fellow, turned on him with, “For
Heaven’s sake, shut up. I'm conducting
this conference.'’ Latham didn’t move a
muscle of his face or show the slightest
emotion, but went on just as if nothing
had occurred: “Yes, but as I was going
to submit to you . . .” And Bryant stood
with his mouth open and listened. This
was a characteristic of Latham. He was
a relentless logician. Professionally,
whether in politics or in law, he pursued
his aim impersonally, and ex parte so
to speak, showing no resentment at
being thwarted and no joy at victory.
The only time I ever saw him look
really delighted was after he had been
appointed Chief Justice. It has con-
ventionally been said that he was mor-
tally disappointed when, after bearing
the distasteful burden of leading a badly
defeated remnant of the Bruce-Page
Party through the depression years in
opposition, the newly-formed UAP
Party snatched the guerdon of the Prime
Ministership from him and bestowed it
on the convert Joseph Lyons. But I
had a long talk with him on the eve of
the 1931 election campaign—I was in
control of the public relations of the
joint UAP-Country parties in New South
Wales. I formed the opinion that he
was rather relieved than otherwise and
I said so.
Whereat he remarked that he had
enjoyed sitting for Kooyong because it
was a congenial electorate. He thought
every constitutional lawyer was the
better for parliamentary and ministerial
experience. He had enjoyed being
Attorney-General because it had enabled
him to gain exciting experience of the
laws at work in a formative period. But
he had not enjoyed the rough and
tumble of leading the shattered remnant
of a party against the exuberant victors
of the Scullin Government who insisted
on regarding him as the cold, hard-
eyed agent of the grinders-of-heels-in-
the-faces-of-the-poor. He seemed to
have taken the imputations of Labor to
heart, remarking that he had been
brought up among poor people and fru-
gality and in the Methodist Church
which was a working man’s church.
TTe said that he was not sure that he
would have had the appeal to the
electorate in general to win the election
and that he thought Lyons was a suitable
leader in the circumstances and that he
was glad to be able to detach himself
and set his sights on other goals more
suitable to his talents and ambitions.
I had the feeling that if he had not
known that his action would have been
misinterpreted he would have withdrawn
entirely from the House at that stage,
but he saw the 1931-34 Parliament out
serving loyally as Lyons’ Deputy Prime
Minister, External Affairs Minister and
Attorney-General till the 1934 election
when he handed over the torch in Koo-
yong to R. G. Menzies, having in 1932
represented Australia at the Disarma-
ment and Reparations Conference.
Throughout his early life the key
words in his career had been impertur-
bable struggle. He had fought to get an
education which took him through a
bright State school and college career,
into a minor job of teaching, then into
the law school of the university where
he won the highest honor available, the
Supreme Court prize and thence into an
equally hard fight for briefs, his frosty
“Iceberg Irvine-ish” manner being
against him. But before World War I
he had a substantial practice in consti-
tutional law, which he abandoned to
join Naval Intelligence, attract the eye
of W. M. Hughes, weather the Peace
Conference on the Prime Minister’s staff
and return to indulge an ambition to
mix law and politics with the study of
foreign affairs, for which he always had
a passion, born when he acted as British
Secretary to the committee which pro-
duced the birth of Czechoslovakia.
After he had abandoned his indepen-
dence in Parliament he became Attorney-
General in 1925 and was one of the two
ministers who accompanied S. M. Bruce
to the historic Imperial Conference of
1926—the other was Sir Neville Howse,
VC, Minister for Defence. He literally
almost worked himself to death over
that historic gathering, which laid the
foundation for the Statute of West-
minster and Australia’s independence as
a nation within the Commonwealth.
During its progress the Navy held a
grand review down at Weymouth and
the official Australian party went out
in Admiral Kelly’s Revenge to see the
fleet arrayed. After lunch, Latham
spoke to me and said: “Can we find a
quiet spot? I am tired out.’’ We went
up to the boat deck and there, sometimes
holding on to my arm, he spent the
afternoon. He seemed very ill, talking
only at intervals, while the giant Hood
and Renown fired 15-inch salvoes over
our heads almost unheeded. As the ships
turned for Spithead and harbor we went
down to the Admiral’s flat and, as he
reached the door of the ante-room, he
collapsed on the deck as if he had been
shot. He seemed to have no pulse and
the naval surgeon who rushed up ex-
claimed: “Good God! I think he’s dying!”
But he wasn’t. All the way to London
in the train he seemed in a state of
collapse. Arthur Manning, the Govern-
ment Whip, and I took him to the Wel-
lington Club in a cab and delivered him.
He was sound asleep on his feet. Neville
Howse, a doctor, had a look at him next
morning and said: “Sheer exhaustion. He


sa ys he worked 48 hours flat.” Next
day he was as bright as a button. A
few weeks afterwards he arrived at
Geneva for the League of Nations
Session and, in an assembly which in-
cluded arresting figures such as Briand
and Stresemann, he made an impression
of which Australia could have been
proud.
When he abandoned politics in 1934
and was sent to Japan on his goodwill
mission, a subtle change seemed to have
come over him. He seemed to have de-
cided that he could see clear ahead to
a final goal and could relax a little and
enjoy the things for which he had not
had time, or which discipline of mind
and body had denied him.
His 16 years in office saw him ever
more broader in his interests which
covered a range that spread from the
drama to music and Australian history.
He developed an admiration for Japa-
nese culture and civilisation and his
foreboding when he returned from
Japan after his second period of duty
there in 1941, convinced that nothing
but darkness lay ahead for our relation-
ships, was tinged with an underlying
belief that roots of impending disaster
grew partly out of the West's failure
to appreciate the potential dynamic and
unity of the Japanese as a nation.
TTis retirement from the Chief Justice-
ship found him with a full life of
usefulness which had been growing in
catholicity of interest over the years.
He had been Chancellor of Melbourne
University, first President of the Aus-
tralian League of Nations Association,
President of the First Australian Legal
Convention, became President of the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust. After he
retired he made frequent visits to Syd-
ney as President of the Australian Asso-
ciation for Cultural Freedom. I think
he enjoyed his old age better than the
other stages of his life. Sometimes,
when he came to Sydney he would come
to lunch and talk about old times. And
there was no period up to the very last
when he did not answer a letter
promptly, or think to write about some-
thing that interested him, usually a brief
note in a scrawling writing or on the
ancient typewriter which he personally
pounded—and usually on the first piece
of paper that came to hand. No Aus-
tralian could have been picked out in
his youth more readily as a youth likely
to live his life within a narrow profes-
sional and academic sphere; none in
history had a life of wider scope and
range both of interests and contacts
and achievements. Quite unassuming,
he was one of the founding fathers of
Australia's modern culture in the wader
sense, of the age of the settling dowm
into sobriety of the effervescences of the
first formative quarter of the century.
Israeli Cultures Old and New
Dancer draws on many sources
By CHARLES SRIBER
An Israeli dancer who believes Aus-
tralia needs to tell the story of its
development in dance form elec-
trified a Sydney audience recently in
what one reviewer called “a unique
experience”. Not that vivacious Wera
Goldman has much to say for local
dance critics.
“I don't mind if they write about my
presentation, that the steps were clumsy
or whatever they think, but most of what
has been written as review of dance here
came from people with no information
to back up their viewpoints,” she said.
One of the highlights of Wera Gold-
man’s Sydney recital was presentation of
Yemeni dances to authentic, taped
Yemeni music. She spoke of the con-
tribution this isolated group of Jews has
made to Israel. “Most historians be-
lieve they are the descendants of Jews
cut off during the time of me fall of the
first temple—that was 586 BC,’ she said.
“The Yemenites forbade them to trade
or hold land. They were forced off the
pavements and treated as rank inferiors.
“In this way they preserved a culture
closer to the stream of ancient Israel
than any other group of Jews. Their
jewellery is remarkable, they have drum
music which they play on kerosene
tins and their dancing is controlled,
using a minimum of floor —almost ver-
tical — but they have made the greatest
contribution to Israeli culture.”
The audience at her Sydney recital
was predominantly non-Jewish. Miss
Goldman finds that most of the Jewish
youth groups “only want to play at
dancing”. The enthusiasm shown in
Sydney and during recitals at the Ade-
laide Festival convinces her that Austra-
lians are ready to merge dance with folk
songs. She danced on TV in a piece by
Margaret Barr called “Snowv River”. It
was subsequently re-filmed for the BBC.
Bom in Vienna, Miss Goldman re-
members Nazi looting and burning of
synagogues, although she was too young
to understand the seriousness of it. With
a young group she managed to leave and
get into Palestine.
Even in the British mandated territory
she felt she was helping to build the new
State. “We all had a sense of responsi-
bility—of dedication,” she said. “I think
this is lacking among Australian young
people. They might be happier if they
were shouldering more responsibility for
their country's future.”
She joined a kibbutz —and worked on
the land. Song and dance were the main
relaxations of the kibbutz and Wera
Goldman, with an innate keenness for
theatre, joined in and composed dances.
Her interest took her to Tel Aviv where
she became an unpaying pupil of
Gertrude Kraus, director of the Israeli
Opera Ballet, herself a former pupil of
Madame Bodenweiser during the Aus-
tralian choreographer's years in Vienna.
Miss Goldman danced with the ballet,
but her main interest was in the develop-
ing folk dances of Israel. “So much
that was new came in at that time, Jews
from all parts of the world, as far
away as India.” The dances that de-
veloped were not really indigenous.
Palestine had been too long under an
alien domination for any ancient cul-
tural lines to endure.
“The ‘ Hora , which most people con-
sider the principal dance of Israel, is
really a Balkan dance,” Miss Goldman
said. “Jews from Russia, Poland and
Rumania all brought their own style of
dancing that merged into ethnic dances.”
Tl/liss Goldman spoke of the influence
of the Arabs. The main Israeli folk
instruments, the flute and the drum, are
Arabic. “The melodic color of the
desert influenced us, as it did the Arabs.
But I think our dances are closest to the
Yugoslav. There, too, a Balkan influ-
ence merged with the oriental inroads of
the Muslims.
“Arab-Israeli hostility is largely arti-
ficial,” Miss Goldman said, “I have
many Arab friends and I think that some
of the smaller Arab countries —Lebanon
for example—would be friendly to us
if it were not for the influence of Nasser.
Of course there are outside pressures.
The Russians prefer to see turmoil in
the Middle East.”
Wera Goldman is working on a dance
she hopes to present on TV. This is
based on the Jewish legend of the
Dybbuk. The interest Australians have
shown encourages her to believe she is
not wasting her time here although she
intends returning to Israel later. She
spoke enthusiastically of her partner at
the Adelaide recitals —Australian dancer
Brian Hokin—and she believes the bulk
of her support is coming from Austra-
lians with no Jewish background. “It’s
good to see male dancers too, ’ she said.
“Of course, in Irael the men have always
danced. It's a Mediterranean tradition.
During the guerrilla fighting with the
British a group of captured soldiers de-
vised the ‘debka’, a dance of defiance
which today is a national dance of
Israel.”

The Wine is not
for Guzzling
Drinking champagne classically ...
By CELLARMASTER
HThis column has occasionally been
castigated for not bearing news of
wines other than those of the still table
varieties. This criticism is perhaps just,
for there is a great deal of interest in
sparkling and fortified wines. On the
other hand, the column has never pur-
ported to be a kind of handyman’s
guide to complete imbibing, and obvi-
ously there is much that is never said
simply because it has been said before
somewhere else, or is not relevant to
help you select the best of what is cur-
rently available.
But since sparkling wines, especially
champagne, are in themselves enor-
mously interesting in their methods of
manufacture, and because in this coun-
try I think they are so often abused,
it is proposed that we devote a little
time to them.
Wines bearing the name “champagne”
on the label are made in quite different
ways in Australia. The most traditional
is the methode champagnoise, in which
the individual bottle is handled many
times during and after second fermen-
tation, finally being placed on “shaking
tables” and twisted daily until the sedi-
ment is ready for disgorging.
The newer, more streamlined opera-
tion is the transfer method, in which
the sediment is not shaken on to the
neck but is discharged after second fer-
mentation into a closed tank, cleaned
and filtered and rebottled, all under
counter pressure, thus eliminating the
daily shaking task and therefore labor
costs. Finally, there are the tank fer-
mentation wines, with little or no bottle
maturation, and the carbonated wines.
There is little doubt that the great
French champagnes are supreme, and
by great we mean classic marques of
declared vintages. However, this coun-
try does make a few champagnes of
very good character with a distinctive
quality.
The top makers place great impor-
tance on the base wine, and possibly
here lies the subtle differences between
the good Australian champagnes. Of
these, I think Great Western brut is the
best, being completely dry, full of
flavor, and having considerable delicacy
and finesse. It may be my supercilious
palate, but I think that perhaps the
standard of the ordinary Great Western
has slipped just a little with the con-
stant demands made by the public upon
it, although there is small doubt that the
brut, made from white Pinot grapes, is
a great wine and one of the real achieve-
ments of Australian winemakers.
Tintara brut, made from Semilion
grapes grown in South Australia with
perhaps just an injection of the famous
Marsanne from Chateau Tahbilk, i s
another wine of high quality. I have
a liking for some of the Lindemans Re-
serve champagnes, based on the lightest
and most delicate Semilion wines from
the Hunter, since they have a honey
character very reminiscent of some of
the French wines.
Yet there are many who assert that
the Hunter wines are not good for
champagne material, since their charac-
ter becomes too pronounced by the time
the wine is ready for drinking. All
these wines, together with the Romalo
champagnes which seem to get better
and better, are made in the old tradi-
tional way, each bottle being handled
two to three hundred times over a period
of from three to six years.
Penfolds, both in Rooty Hill in New
South Wales and Magill in South Aus-
tralia, make champagnes of good
character with the newer transfer
method, as do McWilliams at Yenda.
Perhaps it's inbred snobbery and thence
pure imagination, but these wines seem
a little harder and less delicate than
some of those above. But make no
mistake, these wines are subjected to
the same great care and thought and
long and careful handling that distin-
guishes this part of the wine industry.
Misuse
YTow we come to the public’s accep-
tance and use of these fine wines—
and, by and large, it is woeful. Cham-
pagne is regarded as a celebration wine,
an ulterior motive wine, a Bombe Alaska
wine, a nothing-but-the-best-good-day-
at-the-races wine, and in every case it
is most abused. Frozen almost to the
point of no return, shaken to achieve
the biggest pop, gurgled into large
saucer glasses the quicker to dissipate
the all-precious bubbles, years of tender
care guzzled in a moment of unthinking
self-indulgence.
Champagne is a classic wine, and
should be drunk classically . . . slowly,
appreciatively, from long-stem tulip
shaped glasses that retain the aroma and
flavor, and let the bubbles ride gently to
the surface. It accompanies delicate
meats and fishes, and should never, un-
less very sweet in itself, be served with
ice-creams, bombes and the like. I like
it best as a dinner party aperitif,
served chilled but not frozen, instead of
the omnipresent sherry. In this setting,
the senses, attuned and conditioned by
the anticipation of fine wines and food,
seem to give it the regard and admira-
tion it deserves as possibly the greatest
oil the wheel of good conversation has
ever known.

Three Days
Before the
Deadline
The “Korn” in " Nasakom ”
By FRANK PALMOS
"President Soekarno's threat to Indo-
-*• nesianise the “Kom” elements in
society, and his refusal to comment with
positive favor on the multi-party system
have caused a lull in local politics in
Djakarta.
Leaders of Indonesia's 11 political
parties seem to have suffered a first-
round defeat in their bid to prevent the
anti-party groups from merging or
“simplifying” the parties. They reluc-
tantly agreed to obey the order to sub-
mit details of finance and membership
to an ad hoc committee of three estab-
lished to report on parties to the Presi-
dent.
Djakarta radio last week said the
Minister for Information, Dr Ruslan
Abdulgani, had already given the reports,
and the committee's submissions, to
President Soekarno who was “studying
it”. The three main parties, PNI, NU,
and PKI, handed in their reports only
three days before the deadline, after
receiving an order: “It can't be delayed
again”.
(This referred to the postponement
the parties managed last year when they
were asked for complete information by
December 31.)
“Sinar Harapan,” Djakarta’s moderate
Christian daily, said Ruslan thanked the
parties’ representatives on behalf of the
President before reminding them to con-
tinue increasing national awareness and
strengthening unity.
“Also, be vigilant, and wary of
counter-revolutionary agents”, they were
told. The other members of the com-
mittee, Defence Minister General Nasu-
tion and Minister for the Interior Ipik
Gandamana, were both out of Djakarta
when Abdulgani received the party
delegates.
The President has left the parties won-
dering about the next move. Already
it is rumored in Djakarta that Soekarno
will make no announcement on party
“simplification” until his Independence
Day speech on August 17. There is now
a lull in Press reports on the campaign,
but it is clear the matter is not closed.
The parties have repeatedly asked the
President to clarify his stand during the
three-month Press battle after anti-
party statements by him in the 1950 s
were used as proof that the idea was
his. But Soekarno remained silent until
the last minute —and then he commented
only indirectly, and ambiguously,
through the agency- of his Foreign
Minister, Dr Subandrio.
After a meeting with the President at
the Bogor palace on July 5 Subandrio
went to Bandung to read a message to
the plenary session of the Indonesian
Party (Partindo) on the closing day of
its annual congress. Subandrio said
he had been sent by Soekarno “to tell
you that he still recognises the existence
and value of political parties”.
This unenthusiastic message was fol-
lowed by comments clearly aimed at
the “Kom” part of NASAKOM. “We
must ask ourselves if we are useful re-
volutionaries . . . and in asking this we
must say: ‘Are political parties needed
in Indonesia today?’ ” Subandrio asked.
He then said that parties must adapt
themselves to new conditions . . .
“For as long as there are parties there
will be liberal tendencies. If there is
any reappearance of liberalism, it will
be steam-rollered. So don’t try to make
the Revolution adapt to you—you must
adapt to the Revolution. Already we
are picking the fruit of the Indonesian
ideology . . . there is no need to be
afraid we will become Communist. It
will be the reverse ... we will Indone-
the ‘Kom’ elements in our
society.”
“Sketsmasa’s” attack
“QJketsmasa,” the magazine which
spearheaded the attacks on the
multi-party system, suggesting they may
be merged into a vanguard party, re-
newed the attack by bragging about the
consternation it had caused in party
circles during the campaign.
(“Sketsmasa”, with a circulation close
to 100,000 fortnightly, is Indonesia’s
leading political magazine. It is con-
sidered sympathetic to the idea of the
Army taking a strong hand in govern-
ment, and is anti-PKI.)
The most recent article was headed
“The Revolution demands one party”.
It said that its ideas on party simplifica-
tion had obviously received a lot of
attention, and it was now realised that
lack of unity, and the number of poli-
tical parties, were “two diseases which
obstructed the Revolution”.
“Murba (National Marxist), PNI
(Nationalist) and IKPI (Nationalist) all
agreed. Perhaps the.other parties will
follow suit. The importance of rejuve-
nating the parties can't be denied —they
are the source of squabbling which in-
duces splits in our society.
“Any responsible people with the in-
terests of the nation at heart and who
aren't ‘groupers’ must admit parties and
disunity obstruct the path of the Revolu-
tion. With greater unity—with the
liberal party system eliminated —our
plans for reconstruction will not be
hollow suggestions, and our society will
soon be just and prosperous.
“The first step is rejuvenation. We
use this word in preference to simplifica-
tion. These efforts must not be ‘small
time’, There must be large-scale and
radical demolition. Not only should the
number of parties be reduced but we
must be prepared to pull the party
system down to the ground. It must
be aligned with Indonesian Socialism,
with Guided Democracy, and with Pant-
jasila.
“A one-party system is an essential
aim for our Revolution.”
“Sketsmasa” went on to say that the
parties which didn't agree with Pant-
jasila should be “wiped out”. Other-
wise the jostling will never stop, and
the masses will continue to suffer.
“Sketsmasa” quoted speeches by Soe-
karno advocating a one-party State,
some going back to 1933. “Soekarno
said in October, 1956, that we can’t
develop properly with society the way it
is. He said: ‘Once I dreamed that
leaders of the parties consulted each
other. And I dreamed they reached a
decision: Together we will bury the
parties.
“ ‘People laughed at me, and said
Bung Karno is daydreaming!
“ ‘Well, if they aren't satisfied with my
daydream dialogue, I’ll change it: I'm
not dreaming when I say that all party
leaders should consult, and reach a de-
cision to bury all parties! I repeat, I
am not a dictator. I’m only putting my
finger on the weaknesses of our nation.
After the dissolution of the parties, the
leaders may decide upon one party, or
a mass movement'.”
“Sketsmasa” concluded by referring to
the “historical necessity” of Indonesia
following the lead of Burma, the United
Arab Republic, and other countries
which have one-party systems.


The Day
Of the
Triads
When gangsters thrive. ..
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH
in Singapore
Several hundred Singapore Chinese
were quietly detained, whether they
had broken the curfew or attacked
Malays or not, after last week’s racial
rioting. They were secret society “fight-
ers” detained under special provisions
of the law which permit the police to
remove them from circulation whenever
there is public strife. They are a great
problem to Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew.
The Triad Society gangster is an
adept at using the smoke and confusion
of battle for his own ends, whether to
start a bloody knife fight with a rival
mob or run a protection racket in com-
munities that are temporarily going in
deadly fear of each other.
Perhaps because the police moved
fast, the picturesque weapons of the
Triads were not seen in the messy
clashes between Malays and Chinese that
began on July 21, the anniversary of the
prophet Mohammed’s birthday. Mayhem
was done with clubs, pointed bamboo
staves and knives, but Singapore has
seen fighting with gas-pipe pistols loaded
with ball bearings and fired by touching
a candle to a firecracker fuse, acid
bombs made out of electric light bulbs
and beer bottles, long stilettos disguised
as bicycle pumps, heavy razor - sharp
swords patiently cut and ground out of
solid lengths of steel, and bicycle chains
threaded with lengths of iron tubing.
Old-timers of the Triad Society would
consider even these as no more than
“small arms”, for the brethren have
been known to use cannon in major gang
wars. In the Penang riots of 1867 the
powerless troops and police had to be
withdrawn from most of the battle area,
leaving the rival societies to fight it out
for 10 days before they decided to
negotiate.
Who are these men? Their gadgetry
is limited, and they do not use such
mechanical aids as the Tommy-gun of
Chicago fame, yet they operate on a
tremendous scale. It has been estimated
that one man in every six in Hong Kong
is a Triad member, one Chinese in every
three is touched by Triad activity.
In Singapore there are more than 100
active secret societies and several thous-
and “fighters”. Their rackets have in-
cluded gambling and opium dens, piracy
on the high seas and protection (pay up
or get hurt) operations among the island’s
teeming population of hawkers, prosti-
tutes and taxi-drivers.
The little taxi-girl slips the floor waiter
a few dollars every time she brings an-
other American sailor into a Hong Kong
cabaret. A Singapore export-import firm
pays more than £2OOO a month to have
its cargoes on the wharf “guarded”.
Both are victims of this criminal cell
structure, whose agents swarm in the
malodorous alleys of Chinatown more
thickly than cockroaches.
The Triad is more than this, however.
It is a secret, ritualistic brotherhood of
Chinese, whose arcana derive from the
scrambled teachings of Buddhists and
Taoists, and whose potential for violence
and disorder has been behind revolu-
tions, wars, and even the inclusion of
Malaya in the British Empire.
Founded by monks
JThe traditional history of the Triad
A Society (the Three-in-Union League)
relates that its originators were the five
survivors of the Shao Lin monastery,
the rest of whose 128 fighting monks
were massacred on the orders of the
Manchu Emperor of China in the 18th
century. Inspired by Heaven to destroy
the Manchu usurpers in Peking and
restore the Chinese Ming dynasty to the
Dragon Throne, the five monks founded
five secret lodges for this patriotic task.
From these proliferated the almost
innumerable societies of today, which
in reality should only be branches and
sub-branches of the one Triad Society,
but have more often than not deterior-
ated into rival gangs fighting one another
for ramshackle protection empires in
Asia’s major cities.
In South - East Asia the Chinese
Nationalists and Communists have
wooed the societies, both wanting this
hidden, organised menace on their own
side. The Nationalists tried to unite all
splinter groups into one triad of 300,000
members in Hong Kong after they were
driven from China by Mao Tse-tung.
The 14-K Society, created for this pur-
pose, became notorious when it ex-
panded a political conflict- into savage
riots in the island colony in 1956.
The clannish Chinese who emigrated
to the Straits Settlements and Malaya
in their tens of thousands in the 19th
century grouped themselves for mutual
aid and protection behind secret society
headmen. The British authorities of
Penang and Singapore dealt exclusively
through these ‘“captains” when hand-
ling local Chinese affairs, only discover-
ing in 1870 their true affiliations.
Britain takes over
HPhree years later a squabble over tin-
A mining concessions led to the “Larut
Wars” in North Malaya, in which
Chinese secret societies backing rival
claimants to the sultanate of Perak
fought ferociously for mastery. It was
at this point that merchants asked the
British to restore order in the lawless
and insecure Malayan states, and
Britain took over and administered the
mainland until Malaya was granted in-
dependence in 1957.
The Triad has a magical numerology
of its own: “What’s three times eight?”
one Chinese may ask another in some
downtown coffee shop. “Twenty-one,”
the other should answer. The Triad also
has its own complicated initiation rites,
its own hierarchy and scarlet robes of
office, its own terrible oaths, its secret
hand signals and tattoo marks, its own
legends and superstitions, its own
cosmology.
This elaborate mumbo-jumbo and its
gaudy trappings have been heard and
seen not only throughout the Far East,
but in Hawaii, San Francisco, Sydney,
London and Liverpool, and in a sense
they are responsible for the Triad’s
gradual eclipse. It is becoming too
dangerous and compromising to call the
brethren together for grand ceremonies,
to wear the tattoo marks and give the
signals.
Little by little the ambition of the
police is being realised: the formidable
secret society with its dedicated killers
is giving way—like some vast, carni-
vorous dinosaur —to small gangs of
crooks and teddy-boys. But more than
65 per cent of Singapore crimes still
have a secret society background.

1. High-cost Justice?
Alleged expenses and delays
By A Legal Correspondent
The NSW Attorney-General, the
Hon. R. Downing, has announced
that a Supreme Court Judge will
probably go abroad to observe pro-
cedures in other countries, especially the
United States, designed to avoid delays
in the hearing of cases in the courts.
There has been much discussion in
Sydney recently about alleged delays, but
the NSW Chief Justice has said that the
backlog of cases in the Supreme Court
has been dealt with and the problem now
is that there has been a new “startling
increase” in the cases being brought.
The Chief Justice is almost certainly the
judge who will go abroad to investigate
overseas procedures.
Another current area of dispute has to
do with the alleged high cost of going
to court.
In a recent judgment Mr Justice
McClemens, of the NSW Supreme Court,
made what turned out to be a
very controversial assertion that people
are kept out of the Courts by the high
cost of litigation and in particular by
an alleged growing practice of briefing
two counsel in accident cases.
One of the first to register a public
disagreement with the Judge was Mr
Justice Jacobs of the Supreme Court.
He made it perfectly clear that in the
probate and equity jurisdictions
which some people have always thought
to be expensive—ordinary citizens were
by no means excluded from having their
cases heard.
Mr Justice Jacobs gave in considerable
detail particulars of the litigation before
him during the year. He made it
apparent that most of this litigation did
not arise between the powerful, the rich
and the great, but between ordinary
citizens from the suburbs.
Mr Justice Jacobs pointed out that his
brother Judge, Mr Justice McClemens,
was referring to the Supreme Court on
its common law side. He went on to
say that 80 per cent of the work at
common law is made up of accident
cases. These are cases brought by
people who claim that they have been
injured by negligence on the road or at
work. The Judge did not enter into
direct controversy with Mr Justice
McClemens about these matters. He said
that perhaps there would be even more
of them if Mr Justice McClemens is
right. The Judge was undoubtedly re-
ferring, when he made this remark, to
the fact that in recent years the Supreme
Court has been almost swamped by
negligence cases. The Bench has been
more than doubled since the war, mainly
to cope with negligence actions. It was
only a year or so ago that there was a
great fuss in the Press about the long
wait of litigants to get their cases heard.
This big queue of people waiting for
cases to be heard is, of course, a queue
of ordinary citizens hurt on the roads
or at work.
The President of the NSW Bar Asso-
ciation, Mr J. R. Kerr, QC, announced,
immediately after Mr Justice McCle-
mens’ decision, that the Bar Council,
speaking on behalf of the members of
the practising Bar, believed that it is
simply not the case that litigants are
deterred from litigation or excluded
from the courts because of the suggested
high cost of going to law. On the con-
trary, Mr Kerr said, the lists are full of
cases and there is a considerable back-
log of matters awaiting hearing. He
said: “People from all walks of life and
irrespective of their financial situation
who suffer injuries in motor-car acci-
dents or in industrial accidents, or who
have other claims, have ready access to
the courts represented by able counsel,
either Queen’s Counsel or juniors,
sometimes briefed under the Legal Aid
scheme at no cost to the client.”
Mr Justice McClemens had a lot to
say about what he regarded as a grow-
ing practice of briefing two counsel in
accident cases, but Mr Kerr countered
by saying that it is quite wrong to sug-
gest that any practice in relation to the
briefing of more than one counsel bars
the courts to people needing to resort
to them.
The Bar Council, speaking through its
President, also made the point that the
level of legal costs over the years has
been, to a substantial extent, governed
by the decisions of the courts. “Further-
more,” it was said, “these costs have not
risen to the same extent as other ex-
penses borne by the community.”
There is a very deep-seated feeling
that there is one law for the rich and
one for the poor. It is very commonly
believed that the rich can afford litiga-
tion but that the poor cannot. Another
point of view commonly held is that
perhaps it is both the rich and the poor
(the latter through Legal Aid schemes)
who can afford litigation, but citizens of
medium-income ranges are deterred
from going to law because of the alleged
high cost of litigation.
It follows that whenever any pro-
minent person makes an allegation along
these lines the Press and some members
of the public have a fine time attacking
the law and the lawyers.
The ordinary citizen comes into con-
tact with the law occasionally on the
criminal side; sometimes in a jury action
if he is hurt through negligence; some-


times in the divorce jurisdiction if he
runs into marital trouble; sometimes in
the probate or equity jurisdictions if
there is trouble over a family will or
some dispute between neighbors as to
the existence of a nuisance.
It is very desirable indeed that the
citizen should have access to the courts
and it is just as desirable that there is
no doubt whatever that he has got
access to the courts. The persistence of
the views referred to above, the fact
that people apparently still believe that
the courts are not open to citizens of
limited means, makes it very necessary
for two things to be done. First, the
existing situation should be more widely
known than it is. On the criminal side,
for example, the Bar of New South
Wales provides a regular legal service
to people who get involved with the
criminal law and whose means make it
difficult for them to provide a proper
defence. The Government pays a
limited fee in such cases and the Bar
administers a scheme by virtue of which,
for that limited fee, a counsel is pro-
vided to any person in need of help at
no cost to himself. Recently in such a
case the Government arranged for an
accused person to have representation as
far as the Privy Council, sending a
member of the NSW Bar to London for
the purpose.
There is also a Legal Aid scheme ad-
ministered by the Public Solicitor under
which persons of limited means may go
to law at no cost to themselves, repre-
sented by able counsel including, in
appropriate cases, Queen's Counsel.
Scotching a fallacy
Tn addition to this, the legal profession
A provides voluntarily a very ex-
tensive service to people who cannot
afford to finance, or to finance to the
full, cases which they are properly
entitled to bring. Nevertheless, the view
persists that the courts, which are
really flooded with cases by ordinary
citizens, are in fact closed to them.
It is obviously desirable socially for
this persistent view to be scotched once
and for all. This has, in recent years,
been very effectively achieved in the
United Kingdom from which Australia
doubtless inherited the idea about “one
law for the rich and one for the poor”.
After having developed schemes of
medical aid and dental aid, attention
was directed in England to the provision
of legal aid on a proper basis. The
Government now in the United King-
dom subsidises an excellent Legal Aid
scheme administered by the legal pro-
fession itself, under which any citizen
who has a case which on any fair view
of the matter ought to be litigated has
obvious and clear access to the courts.
This scheme is not only administered by
the legal profession, but almost all mem-
bers of the profession, barristers and
solicitors, participate in the scheme. The
client makes a contribution to the costs
according to his means. The legal pro-
fession also makes a contribution and
the Government subsidises the whole
system which is very well and very
liberally administered. It is not a
bureaucratic or “socialised” system be-
cause every individual who has a case
brings that case to the courts, not by
going to a Government Law Office or
to a Public Solicitor but by going to the
solicitor and barrister of his own selec-
tion. He undoubtedly has the advice
and help in this way of the persons he
believes will be best able to look after
him.
The British Government has, there-
fore, once and for all got rid of the idea
in England that there is one law for the
rich and one for the poor, and this has
been an enormous step forward in social
terms in the United Kingdom. Every-
one of Her Majesty’s subjects now has
access to Her Majesty’s courts.
The Law Council of Australia ap-
parently wants to see a similar Legal
Aid scheme in Australia. A week or so
ago it was announced that the Law
Council of Australia was making repre-
sentations to the Federal Government
to have a Legal Aid scheme adopted tor
Federal courts and cases arising in the
Federal jurisdiction (including divorce
cases). The scheme being recommended
is in principle similar to the English
scheme.
At first sight there appears to be an
inconsistency between the attitudes of
the NSW Bar Association and that of
the Law Council of Australia. The
NSW Bar Association, on the one hand,
says that the ordinary citizen does have
access to the courts and is not deterred
from litigation by the alleged high cost
of going to law. On the other hand, the
Law Council of Australia advocates a
new Legal Aid scheme in Federal mat-
ters similar to the British scheme. The
fact, however, is that in Federal matters
there is no satisfactory Legal Aid
scheme operating at the moment on a
national basis and doubtless the State
Legal Aid schemes themselves could be
greatly improved. Furthermore, although
it is obvious that in the Supreme Court
of NSW people injured on the roads or
at work by negligence are producing
great numbers of cases, it is desirable
to organise things in such a way that no
one can claim to be excluded from the
courts for financial reasons.
The legal profession, therefore, ap-
parently feels that systems of legal aid
should receive very careful study and
attention. In this country, with its
system of medical benefits, pharmaceu-
tical benefits and so on, it is certain that
the Government will ultimately come
around to giving close attention to
schemes of legal aid.
As to delay in the courts, ttention is
also being given to this through the
Government Law Reform Committee,
and the Chief Justice of NSW is going
overseas to investigate ways and means
of avoiding delay. The queue of ordi-
nary citizens with damages claims seems
to be getting too long. When Legal Aid
schemes get better will the queue get
longer and longer? These twin problems
of legal aid and delay in the Courts are
both important, but the fact undoubtedly
is that there is no great social injustice
at the moment. Ordinary people in-
jured in accidents do get their cases to
court though perhaps with a little too
much delay.

2. The Unfinished Case
of Dr. Sheppard
When justice teas seen not to be done?
By GORDON HAWKINS
(Lecturer in Criminology, University of Sydney )
Late in the afternoon, a few days
before Christmas, 1954, the jury
filed back into the courtroom in
the snow-covered Criminal Courts build-
ing at Cleveland, Ohio. They had re-
tired on Friday, December 17; it was
now Tuesday, December 21. After 40
hours in the jury room and 18 ballots
they had reached unanimity. A reporter,
present throughout the two-month trial,
noted that they kept their eyes “almost
ostentatiously averted” from the pale,
nervous figure of Dr Samuel H. Shep-
pard, accused of the brutal murder of
his pregnant wife Marilyn.
As expected, the verdict was guilty;
guilty of second-degree murder, which
in Ohio is an inten-
tional slaying with-
out premeditation.
Within ten minutes
of the jury’s return,
Dr Sheppard was
hustled from the
court by two deputy
sheriffs, sentenced
to the penitentiary
for the rest of his
natural life. One of
the most sensational,
most publicised and most controversial
murder trials of modern times had
ended.
But, as those of us who indulge our
homicidal tastes vicariously have re-
cently discovered, the Sheppard case was
not closed. Indeed it was only just
beginning. Yet the reports below the
gaudy headlines which greeted Dr Shep-
pard's release, after serving 10 years, on
July 16, were more concerned with his
“attractive silver-blonde German divor-
cee pen-pal fiancee” than with details of
the original trial or the ensuing struggle
in and out of courts.
Nevertheless, the Sheppard murder
trial and the subsequent legal actions
arising out of the case are of more than
ephemeral interest. Indeed, as Erie
Stanley Gardner —who seeks relaxation
from his work on the Perry Mason
stories in the investigation of possible
miscarriages of justice in real criminal
cases —has said, the Sheppard case raised
“important problems, vital to our way
of life” which “affect us all more inti-
mately than we realise”.
Briefly the facts of the case, insofar
as they are known, are as follows: At
some time between 3 a.m. and 5.30 a.m.
(the exact time was never fixed beyond
dispute) on the morning of July 4, 1954,
Marilyn Sheppard was ferociously
bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of
the attractive white house on the shore
of Lake Erie, Cleveland, in which she
lived with her husband and son.
She was found lying on her back on
her bloodsoaked bed, half covered by a
sheet. Fragments of her teeth were
found in the bed and on the floor of
the room, all four walls of which were
blood-spattered. She had received 35
separate wounds on her face, head, neck
and hands.
Despite a minute
search of the house,
grounds and lake
bottom, the weapon
with which she was
killed was never
found. Although it
W'as proved, and
indeed never con-
tested, that Dr
Sheppard was in the
house when his wife
was killed, that is
about all that was proved; the rest was
inference.
Dr Sheppard’s story, from which he
has never significantly departed to this
day, runs as follows: On the night before
the murder Mrs Sheppard had invited
their neighbors, Mr and Mrs Don Ahern,
and their two children to dinner. After
the dinner Don Ahern took his two
children home, put them to bed and
returned.
Following an evening of conversation,
listening to radio and watching televi-
sion, the Aherns left for home at about
12.30 a.m. Sam Sheppard, who had
fallen asleep, stated subsequently that
he did not hear the Aherns leave but
had a hazy memory of being partially
awakened by his wife, who told him
she was going to bed. He then went
back to sleep.
“The next thing I recall,” he said,
“was hearing her cry out or scream.”
He followed this with a confused
account of a struggle with a bushy-
haired, white-shirted intruder, in the
course of which he twice lost conscious-
ness. When he finally recovered con-
sciousness he rang a friend and neighbor
who lived a few doors west and was the
local mayor. On arrival the mayor
called the police and an ambulance,
Sheppard was taken to hospital where
apart from facial, jaw and other body
bruises, he was found to have a frac-
tured neck vertebra, contusion of the
spinal cord and possible concussion of
the brain.
The prosecution theory was that the
doctor had beaten his wife to death as
the climax to a quarrel which took place
shortly after the Aherns had gone home.
The doctor's injuries were said to be self-
inflicted. The reason given for the
quarrel was the doctor's attentions to
other women. In particular, reference
was made to an affair with a young
woman with whom it was alleged he had
talked “about divorce and marriage'’,
it is probable that the most damaging
evidence against Sheppard in the eyes
of the jury concerned the doctor’s re-
lations with this woman, an attractive,
24-year-old laboratory technician. He
had been sexually intimate with her over
a period of two years, the last occasion
being less than four months before the
murder. He perjured himself about this
at the inquest in order, he said, to pro-
tect the girl's reputation. At the trial he
was forced to admit the truth.
Perverse verdict
At the time stories of much more ex-
tensive promiscuity were widespread,
including a false and slanderous item
broadcast by Walter Winchell to thej
effect that a woman held in New York
had told authorities that she was the 1
mother of a child by Sheppard. Such |
stories die hard, and only the other day r
a Sydney paper stated that “at his trial
Dr Sheppard admitted affairs with three
women, after his wife ‘lost her sexual
aggressiveness’.” In fact he made no
such admission at his trial, or anywhere
else for that matter, despite a gruelling
cross-examination on the subject of his -
relations with other women. (Although
it is true that a clinical examination
sometime prior to her death revealed
that “the sex relation was painful” to,
Mrs Sheppard.)
It has been said that Sheppard was |
proved guilty of adultery but convictei
of murder; and there is no doubt that
juries have on occasion inferred guilt in
murder cases from evidence of infidelity
Despite the finding of guilt many,
observers believed that the verdict was
perverse and that the jury were
by motives other than the desire tof
return the right verdict on the evidence.
Thus it cannot have helped Sheppard
that he was the subject of a sustained
hostile campaign conducted in both thei
editorial and news columns of all three!

Cleveland newspapers. Their “inflam-
matory and prejudicial reporting”, said
the Federal Judge who freed Sheppard,
resulted in “a perfect example” of “trial
by newspaper”.
In this context one of the most ironi-
cal features of the case was the way in
which the doctor's respected position in
society, influential friends, wealth and
ability to hire expensive lawyers opera-
ted so as to illustrate the old aphorism
about “one law for the rich and one for
the poor”, in a manner exactly contrary
to its ordinary meaning. With news-
papers publishing editorials headed
“GETTING AWAY WITH MUR-
DER”, denouncing the authorities for
delay and for treating the accused in an
“extra-privileged” manner, the result was
that Sheppard in the end was prosecuted
with unparalleled rigor under a presiding
judge clearly prejudiced against him;
who, while the trial was under way, con-
fided to a newspaper columnist that
Sheppard was as “guilty as hell".
Viewed objectively, however, the pro-
secution case was curiously unconvin-
cing. It was a prosecution witness who
described the doctor as “always cool,
calm, collected, and even-tempered” and
added “In all the time I knew him I
never saw him become angry”. Yet the
suggestion was that, as the result of a
quarrel, he had flown into a rage and
bludgeoned his wife with a ferocity so
appalling that it seems consistent only
with maniacal fury.
Absence of blood stains
Again, the theory that the injuries to
the back of Sheppard's neck and his
own face were self-inflicted is difficult to
accept because of the peculiar difficulty
involved in delivering the sort of blows
required. No less extraordinary was the
absence of blood stains on Sheppard's
clothing except for a large spot on the
left knee which was consistent with his
own story regarding his examination of
his wife's body.
In the decade since the original trial
Sheppard’s lawyers have conducted an
unremitting campaign on his behalf. Two
days after the verdict a motion asking
for a new trial was filed with some 40
reasons advanced in it. The trial judge
overruled the motion. In the spring of
1955 two separate appeals were made to
the Eighth Ohio District Court of Ap-
peals. The judges rejected both appeals.
The case next went, early in 1956, to
the Supreme Court of Ohio. The
Supreme Court divided five to two, and
with two judges sharply dissenting and
saying that the judgment of conviction
should have been reversed, the judgment
of the Court of Appeals was affirmed.
A novelist intervenes
TTowever, final decisions of State courts
may be brought for review before
the United States Supreme Court where
matters relating to the US Constitution
are involved and where the court con-
sents to make a review. A petition
listing reasons for believing that Shep-
pard was deprived of due process of law
was considered by the Supreme Court
late in 1956. The petition was rejected.
In 1957 the case was taken up by
Erie Stanley Gardner’s Court of Last
Resort, a private organisation founded
in 1944, devoted to investigating cases
of possible injustice. This attempt by
an “unofficial outfit” from outside the
State to intervene not surprisingly an-
gered the Ohio authorities, and in the
end nothing ever became of it.
Then, late in 1958, a petition was
filed in the Supreme Court of Ohio for
a writ of habeas corpus. This proceeding
dragged -on for 20 months before the
petition was dismissed in May, 1960.
Having exhausted all possible remedies
in the State courts the defence lawyers
then brought a habeas corpus proceeding
in a Federal court.
Finally, a few weeks ago the Federal
District Court at Columbus, Ohio,
ordered Sheppard’s release on the
ground that his trial involved five spe-
cific violations of his constitutional
rights, including the partiality of the
judge, failure to grant a change of
venue, failure to maintain impartial
jurors and the improper admission of
evidence. The Ohio authorities were
instructed to pursue a new trial within
60 days or the release would be per-
manent. There the matter now rests.
In addition to what has already been
said two points appear to be worth
making. One relates to the assertion
made by many commentators that Shep-
pard was convicted “only on circum-
stantial evidence”. This reflects a popu-
lar misconception which ought to be
dispelled. Criminal convictions are
commonly secured on circumstantial
evidence, if only because of an under-
standable reluctance on the part of crimi-
nals to perform in front of witnesses.
Nor is eye-witness evidence necessarily
more reliable. It is notable that two
of the most celebrated cases of wrongful
conviction and imprisonment, those of
Oscar Slater and Adolf Beck, who served
18i and eight years respectively, were
the result of the evidence of eye-
witnesses.
The second point is this. At the time
of the Caryl Chessman case, with its
protracted series of appeals culminating
in his execution, the administration of
justice in the United States was widely
criticised on the ground that a “too
sensitive” appeals system was responsible
for unwarranted delays. Yet if Sam
Sheppard did not kill his wife —and few
today would deny that there is ground
for reasonable doubt about this —then
those who are concerned about justice
should be glad that so many avenues of
appeal were open to the accused.


Around Melbourne
DIALLING FOR A PRAYER AND A BET
/Canberra is to get an off-course
tote any minute and New South
Wales will have a TAB in action be-
fore Christmas. This is a matter of
great sadness for us. NSW has had
its 10 o’clock closing, its one-armed
bandits and our one opportunity to
out-deprave Sydney has been the TAB
and a certain abandon in allowing
serve-yourself petrol bowsers.
Why, until now clergymen like the
Rev. Gordon Powell from St Stephen’s
Presbyterian Church in Sydney have
come over specially to look at our
wickedness. In a month or two there
will be nothing worth looking at,
except for those coin-in-slot bowsers.
In Australasia only South Australia
will be left without a system, and
they, too, show signs of imminent
corruption. A Government repre-
sentative and two politicians were
here looking at our system last week,
apart from three others from Sydney.
Please excuse that word TAB. It
is convenient and it stands for Totali-
sator Agency Board, a system of
making undreamed-of amounts of
money. The general manager, Mr
Ken Davis, has just announced that
the turnover for the racing year end-
ing July 31 is expected to be £40.5
million. That’s £2O a year for every
Victorian over 19. Admittedly it’s
not as much as the Victorian Govern-
ment spent on education during the
1961-62 financial year, £56 million,
but do not look down your nose; the
TAB is gaining. Within three or four
years it could reach £7O million. You
see, the first year it was £ 11T million,
the second £261 million and now
£4Ol million.
The number of agencies also has
grown in equally as exciting a manner.
We may have had trouble in building
library space for university students,
but, by jiminy, nobody can say we
haven’t built betting boxes. At Cup
time, for example, we had 147; now
there are 213. The TAB is part of
our domestic scene. Eventually we
should have about 340 agencies. That
is, wherever two or three people
gather together in Victoria, there is
sure to be a TAB office.
Our own personal TAB is ideally
located, right next door to the Bank
of NSW and the delicatessen, and
immediately opposite the pub and
the butcher. The Rev. Powell, when
he was here, said: “They excite a
fever, a sort of mass psychology
and even I had difficulty in holding
myself back.”
Actually, psychologically, they are
downright disappointing. They have
the sterile, antiseptic aridity of an
insurance office. Under the Act they
can provide no comforts, no inspira-
tion to loiter. Therefore there are to
be no seats and certainly no transistor
radios.
Of course, this has been marvellous
for business, and many a hotel has
done everything possible to attract a
TAB agency nearby. After all, where
else can a gentleman loiter and listen
to his transistor but over the road in
the public bar? As a result the pubs
have been doing fine, particularly on
country meeting afternoons, Tues-
days, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
You must understand there are only
three days in Victoria when life dies
completely. It is hard to find race
meetings on Sundays, Mondays and
Fridays.
T>ut what happens to all the
" money? It’s every racing dub’s
dream come true. First the Govern-
ment gets four per cent, and that
means more than £ll million for
hospitals and charities this year. Then
the VRC will receive maybe £250,000,
including £150,000 for administration
costs; the VATC will get nigh
on £300,000 and Moonee Valley
£150,000. The country clubs and the
trots also will get their cut.
This is getting racing out of its big
debts and saving it from ruin. At
last stakes are faintly beginning to
approach costs. Stakes for the VRC
autumn carnival went up £21,200,
all due to Fairy Godmother TAB, and
now it is the general thing for fourth
place-getters to receive a prize.
Attendance is much the same as in
the pre-TAB era, about 22,000 for
an average Flemington meeting,— the
equivalent of a mediocre VFL footy
match. The VRC put a safeguard
into the TAB so that attendance at
the track would still be somewhat
desirable. You cannot pick up your
winnings after each race to build up
your betting power. Worse than that,
you can’t pick it up at all until the
next day.
As for habits in betting, they are
much the same. At the TAB office
I was told that in New Zealand their
TAB had been going for 13 years
and, as in the old days, the New
Zealanders were more interested in
place bets, whereas in Victoria they
tended to back for a win. This was
a hangover from the days when they
used to deal with the SP bookie.
Quinella didn't amount to much; the
big thing and the most amazing boom
of all was in “doubles”. Doubles now
amounted to 40 per cent of the bet-
ting at most meetings, and up to 50
per cent in the country. Any person
with good, red, gambling corpuscles
can't resist the double.
Oh, the TAB is moving on to
grander things. It is planning to put
up its own fancy building in Queen’s
Road. It is talking to “nine of the
world's largest computing companies”
in the hope of reducing the deadline
for TAB betting from 40 minutes to
25. Mr Davis says there’s no parallel
in the world to the tight time-
schedule operation of TAB. Ap-
parently the high-speed handling of
all bets before a race is a computer
problem, the equivalent of shooting
down an approaching intercontinental
missile.
Finally, as from August 1, the start
of this season, the TAB has intro-
duced a 24-hour phone service for
tote dividends and scratchings at city
and country race meetings, just like
the PMG’s weather and cricket-score
service. The keen punter now has
the comfort of first being able to dial
a prayer, then dial the TAB.

The Near Side of Hell
Fall of a god-priest
By PETER HASTINGS
Festival of Performing Arts: The
Crack Up. Channel 2. Sydney,
“you poor son of a bitch,” Dorothy
-*■ Parker said of the dead Scott Fitz-
gerald. And he undoubtedly was. His
fresh, different talent, which had been
enormous, was far greater than his abil-
ity to discipline it, while his fear of
failure, his uncertain pride and addiction
to pleasure eventually destroyed it. After
that there wasn't much left apart from a
last, abortive blaze of creative activity in
“The Last Tycoon”, which he never
finished, and his de profundis, “The
Crack Up”.
Fitzgerald was a tremendous per-
sonality, a creator and creation of
the Jazz Age, a snob, a romantic,
an alcoholic and an exhibitionist. He
was the spoiled god-priest to whom no-
thing was denied he could live it up
on the Riviera, trade blows with Heming-
way, jump in and out of fountains
with Zelda and earn 40,000 dollars
a year in a country with no in-
come tax. He could get away with
anything, it seemed, even with shod-
dy, second-rate writing which, while
it was exciting, a move in new
directions, was largely the portrait of
the artist as a young fake. But the talent
was there, and it grew steadily during the
decade; surprisingly he got better and
better and with “The Great Gatsby” he
wrote a novel authentically concerned
with the American vision, an American
masterpiece. But Fitzgerald was like his
own Gatsby some “foul dust float-
ed in the wake of his dreams”.
The parties got wilder, the talent more
stretched, the friendships more strained.
Money deserted him and his private life
began to resemble a chamber of horrors.
The god-priest had more gifts than dedi-
cation and when the inevitable happen-
ed, Fitzgerald described the results in
“The Crack Up”, a painfully meticulous
account of the loss of his creative energy
and capacity the near side of hell.
Even now, it makes good reading, being
both unique and painful. Surprisingly, it
makes even better TV theatre. One
forgets the dramatic, colloquial talent
hidden in Fitzgerald. Jason Robards
Jnr who read “The Crack Up” or
acted it on ABN’s Festival of Per-
forming Arts last Sunday week, brought
out its extreme flavor of irony, hatred,
self-pity and savage self-deprecating
humor. This was mostly due to his skill
as an actor, but not a little to the fact
that he has a surprising resemblance to
an older Fitzgerald, a resemblance which
grew with haunting sadness during the
performance.
“JTlhe Crack Up” is an extraordinary
A document and Robards made it not
merely one of personal idiosyncrasy and
curiosity, but intensely moving as well.
One wasn't reading Fitzgerald but actu-
ally listening to the poor son of a bitch.
To record, said Fitzgerald, one has to
be unwary and he was always that, and
imprudent too. But it nevertheless takes
a particular kind of courage to expose
personal weaknesses to the world even
with the aid of “the tin cup” of self pity.
Therefore in the acted version one notic-
ed things that one hadn't in reading the
original. Thus while one waited for
the sombre reference to “the dark night
of the soul where it is always three
o’clock in the morning,” one wasn’t ready
for the savagely funny passages dealing
with Fitzgerald's preparations for future
defences against the world in which he
would perfect a particular smile and a
particular voice, the unctuous “yes” of
the lawyer, to hide the agony within. And
what had seemed bathos in the original
suddenly appeared genuine tragedy when
spoken. “The old dream of being an
entire man in the Goethe-Byron-Shaw
tradition . . . has been relegated to the
junk heap of the shoulder pads worn for
one day on the freshman football field
at Princeton and the overseas cap never
worn overseas.” But at the end of the
sad, funny, snarling self-indictment,
Robards’ Fitzgerald neither fooled him-
self nor tried to fool anyone else. “Don't
think,” he said, “that if you throw me a
bone I won’t lick your hand like a grate-
ful dog.” A hell of an end for a god-
priest.
Gothics and
Gorgons
The Outer Limits. Channel 9, Sydney.
T\ne of the saddest casualties of Holly-
wood’s recent years has been the
small-budget Teutonic thriller in which
the images are liable to be shadow-
barred, the villains furtively decadent,
the street scenes splashed with photo-
genic rain-puddles and the climactic
scenes of terror and pursuit shot from
ant or eagle level. And with this demise
of a rewarding genre have gone the
German-American directors who carried
the whole psychic world of Hoffmann
and his imitators intact via UFA into
the American cinema.
Television, though, has intermittently
taken up the tradition: with its hypnotic-
ally concentrated images and intimate,
probing camerawork it is ideally suited
to an exploitation of the macabre. Rod
Serling’s “Twilight Zone” manages some
fine episodes: I remember one in par-
ticular that was right in the UFA
tradition, a group of people trapped in
a giant time capsule while a madman
plans to destroy the city they are in:
this, containing Joseph Wiseman’s re-
markable performance as the maniac,
was a direct descendant of Fritz Lang’s
“Metropolis”.
The “Thriller” series last year carried
on the Gothic style with splendid
panache : haunted mirrors, pigeons grip-
ped by a mysterious psychic terror, a
giant and his companion Dr Beelzebub
looming out of marsh mists to frighten
a pair of motorists, a woman dragged
to a ritual witch-burning in what ap-
peared to be an outsize laundry basket:
splendid stuff. And one or two episodes
went beyond the merely gruesome into
the knowingly sinister - satirical: most
notably John Brahm’s “A Wig for Miss
Devore”, involving an actress whose wig
keeps her forever “young” and who is
brilliant twist on the way Hollywood
legends are destroyed—finally brought to
her doom by an inquisitive columnist.
This story was worthy of Balzac or
Sheridan Le Fanu; so, too, was Ida
Lupino’s “The Last of the Somervilles”,
about a murderous niece who coolly
eliminates the older heirs to the family
fortune. This episode at once mimicked
and surpassed “Kind Hearts and Coro-
nets”: in one scene, a hag aunt meets
her comeuppance in a bathtub, the
camera icily observing her moth-eaten
boa dropping to the floor, her inane
hummed ditty interrupted by an electric
crackle, then following the wire through
potted plants and bric-a-brac to its
lethal source in the basement. Wittily
directed and played with brilliant ex-
aggeration by Martita Hunt and Boris


Karloff, this was a tour de force of the
medium.
“The Outer Limits” is the latest
addition to the genre to occupy the
goldfish bowl: the directors include
Laszlo Benedek, who directed “The Wild
One” and “Death of a Salesman”, and
Gerd Oswald, an interesting recruit to
the German-American cinema who made
a subtly ironical melodrama, “Scream-
ing Mimi”, some years ago, as well as
“A Kiss Before Dying”. The themes of
the stories combine the UFA tradition
with contemporary trappings: a psy-
chiatrist and a psychotic patient ex-
change minds; an assassin moulds him-
self “by molecular rearrangement” into
the image of the President he has killed;
in one splendidly abandoned episode,
the power output of a television station
is itself transformed into a monster, a
densely packed mass of energy in human
form. An extraordinary moment of
pathos occurred in Laszlo Benedek’s
otherwise ordinary “Tourist Attraction”
when a sea monster, put on show by
a Latin American dictator, calls in its
misery to thousands of its fellow denizens
of the deep: a plea for a Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Fish if
ever I heard one. And the monster
itself, like the hero of that classic
cartoon “The Herring Murder Mystery”
with arms and swivel eyes, was a splen-
did creation, moving along the ocean
floor in a rapt trance, stretching out
its arms promiscuously to whoever
happened to be passing by.
In “The Sixth Finger”, a miner is
subjected to an experiment in molecular
genetics, transferred to various stages
of man’s future mental development:
from a tiresome oaf with a chip on his
shoulder he turns into a haughty seven-
footer with a kind of Easter egghead
insecurely fastened on top, learning to
play Bach in fifteen seconds and master-
ing infinitesimal calculus in much the
same time it takes most of us to learn
to use an abacus. In the best episode
so far, “It Crawled Out of the Wood-
work”, a cleaning woman sucks up
some recalcitrant dust in her vacuum
bag; the bag bursts, and the contents
emerge as what appears to be a gigantic
teddy bear made of dust, ready to give
heart attacks, or worse, to the beholder.
Those who have had the misfortune to
see it are kept alive thereafter by
gadgets like miniature tape recorders
affixed to their chests, their hearts kept
pumping artificially by means of elec-
trical power. The idea was worthy of
Welles, and Gerd Oswald’s Teutonic
direction, from the powerful distorting-
lensed opening of the discovery of the
monster to the final showdown when the
local electricity was cut off, had a Fritz
Lang-like intensity. Barbara Luna as
the monster’s robot-like scientist-cus-
todian also made it clear she knew the
tradition she was working in: a remark-
able performance, subtly agonized and
taut.
CHARLES HIGHAM
THEATRE
Comic Cutouts
Breakfast with Julia. Burton Graham.
Phillip Theatre, Sydney.
Tt might have been*“Lunch with Maisie”
or “Dinner with Harriet”, but it was
“Breakfast with Julia”. Burton Graham’s
play at the Phillip Theatre, Sydney, estab-
lished itself from the title through to the
final curtain line as the direct descen-
dant of the British knockabout farce, the
French bedroom comedy and the New
York apartment laff-riot. Transplanted
to a King’s Cross flat it was indistin-
guishable from its models and, because
of that, mostly undistinguished.
But although “Breakfast with Julia”
does not do anything more for Aust.
Lit. than its author intended, it has its
funny moments, and, after all, it is just
as hard in the conditions of the Aus-
tralian theatre to produce a polished
pebble as a rough-hewn masterpiece.
Mr Graham must be credited with the
somewhat negative virtue of managing
to present urban Australians without
embarrassment to local audiences, who
are, after all, urban Australians. This is
something at which authors with far
greater pretensions than Mr Graham
have failed, and recently. But so-called
cosmopolitan people of the whisky-on-
the-rocks, orange-juice-for-breakfast type
don’t have much flavor. Mr Graham has
robbed himself of some of the opportu-
nities there were for comedy in his ori-
ginal idea by peopling it with cardboard
cutout characters, in the belief that these
represented members of a “nation of
city-dwellers, most of whom live well-
ordered lives in decent surroundings”.
The action of the play is mostly con-
fined to four people opening and closing
doors in a King’s Cross flat. Mr
Graham’s comic gifts are in devising
movement rather than in dialogue. The
play is sparsely supplied with witty lines,
even the mechanically-witty lines of
many imported plays of similar type. Its
chief flaw is that it gathers its laughs too
easily and greedily the length of the play,
rather than building to a climax of mis-
apprehension and misdemeanor from
which the audience feels, even momen-
tarily, that the characters will never ex-
tricate themselves. Having taken his
share in Act One the author cannot ex-
pect a second harvest from the same
ground in Act Two.
Irene Mitchell made such effective use
of the material given her that it became
something of a producer’s play. James
Mellen, as the American naval officer,
Buzzie, made it painfully clear how un-
bearable nice, clean-cut American naval
officers are. The other three players,
Marie Redshaw, Glenna Brydon and
James Condon succeeded only in vary-
ing degrees. Miss Brydon was hampered
by a poorly-written role and Miss Red-
shaw may have been unnerved by a flat,
lengthy opening sequence.

Personal Choice
Dealer’s Selection. Recently at Rudy
Komon Gallery. Sydney.
"Oudy Komon, following closely on
European trends after the war,
was our first dealer to establish a “stable”
of young painters, giving them the neces-
sary support from the time they needed
it most. Such an investment can be very
profitable should the artists chosen be-
come firmly established.
All too many artists in London or
Paris tiresomely repeat formulae they
have established in order to maintain a
saleable line. Rudy Komon is not afraid
to show his artists at moment of doubt:
Molvig and Eric Smith are cases in point.
Each casts adrift in little-known seas;
they exhibit frequently pretty well what
they like. Blackburn, Boyd, Pugh, Wil-
liams, French, Cassab, Coburn, Dicker-
son, Sibley, to name a few, diverge so
much it is difficult to see that they have
anything in common.
A degree of astuteness informed Ko-
mon’s latest selection of some of these
out-of-State works. As one might expect,
this “Dealers’ Selection” had a stimula-
ting mixture of good, off-beat and not-
so-successful painting. Looking rather
like a high conservative, acceptable piece,
the Arthur Boyd, a grey, rain-drenched
landscape with hunter and dog harks
back to the early forties. “Red
Hills” of the same vintage, similarly
appeared a restrained exploration of near
objectivity in view of later expressionist
upsurgings. The Dobell sketch for
“Helena Rubinstein”, more sensitively
realised than any large version, looked
out in this company as a revered old
master.
Roger Kemp’s unequivocal cubist
abstraction reminded us of the all-too-
few occasions when one can enjoy his
work in Sydney. Molvig’s solid reminis-
cence of primitive sculpture reasserted
his biting style of two years ago. Orban
exhibited an uncharacteristic but en-
gaging excursion into linear fantasy
while Blackman’s painterly handling
emerged stronger for his having taken
up the oil medium once more.

Messiaen
Olivier Messiaen’s “Quartet for the
End of Time”, recently performed
at an ISCM concert, is the first of this
composer’s large-scale works to be per-
formed in Sydney. Written in 1940
when he was a prisoner of war, it reflects
the experiences of those times as seen
from Messiaen's personal point of view.
In the face of the German occupation
of France, Messiaen re-asserted eternal
truths: the quartet is written “in homage
to the Angel of the Apocalypse, who
lifts his hand to the sky, saying: ‘There
shall be no more time’ ”. It has eight
movements —six for the days of creation,
one for “the divine sabbath”, and one
for eternity, into which the sabbath
leads.
The religious character of much of
Messiaen's music makes him unique
among the major composers of this cen-
tury. But the religious school to which
he belongs is one that is uncongenial
to many listeners, including those who
admire Victoria or Bach. There is a
tradition of French-Catholic piety in
which the French traits of realism and
sensibility find their expression in an
attachment to the picturesque and senti-
mental (St Margaret Mary Alacoque,
the cult of St Therese of Liseux). As an
exponent of this tradition, Messiaen
lacks both the disciplined ardor of
Spanish religiosity and the single-minded-
ness of German.
Moreover, Messiaen is heir to a tradi-
tion in French music of what might be
called religious sensualism —a tradition
stemming from Franck and, through
him, from Wagner, paying attention al-
most exclusively to the voluptuousness
of religious experience, and ignoring
dogma and ascetic discipline. Messiaen’s
own brand of piety provides this kind of
approach to religious music with an
almost ideal habitat. “Our goal,” he
says, “is an iridescent music, one which
will delight the auditory senses with de-
licate, voluptuous pleasures,” which,
according to Messiaen, “will lead him
(the listener) gently towards that theolo-
gical rainbow which is the ultimate goal
of the music we are seeking to build.”
(It should be added that in recent years
Messiaen has abandoned specifically
religious music, and now intends to de-
vote the rest of his life to works based
on bird calls.)
But whatever one thinks of Messiaen’s
ideas about the function of his music,
or of the diffuseness of form and mawk-
ishness of content that his ideas give
rise to, it is impossible to deny that he
is a superbly-talented musician. The last
movement of the quartet, for instance,
“Praise to the Immortality of Jesus”,
seems to have nearly everything against
it a monotonous rhythm, a dead-slow
tempo, and an almost obsessive use of
one of the tiredest chords in music, the
added sixth cord. Despite this, it is one
of the best movements of the quartet,
and a fine piece of music.
This movement is typical of Mes-
siaen in that the most successful aspects
of it are his handling of the more
“sensual” elements of music—instrumen-
tal color, and harmony. On the other
hand, the rhythmic devices he employs
in the first movement strike one as some-
how irrelevant to the music. This is to
be expected in a composer whose control
of form, of progress in time, is not very
strong, but it is surprising that Messiaen,
whose main contributions to the theory
of music have been in the field of
rhythm, should be this kind of composer.
It is as though Messiaen’s theoretical
interest in rhythm has been an unsuccess-
ful attempt to overcome his inability to
handle rhythm satisfactorily.
If he had never written a note,
Messiaen would still be remembered as
one of the foremost theorists and teach-
ers of his time. But his achievement
has been much more than this. For,
despite its flaws in taste and construc-
tion, Messiaen’s best music, including the
quartet, is amongst the finest written this
century.

Memoirs of the Lost
Generation
Between two wars in Hemingway’s Paris
By DAVID MARTIN
A Moveable Feast. Ernest Heming-
way. Jonathan Cape. 28s.
“’T'he greatness of a writer has nothing
to do with subject matter itself,
only with how much the subject matter
touches the author. It is the density of
style which counts. Through Heming-
way’s style you feel matter, iron, wood.”
The words are Pasternak’s and they were
spoken in answer to the criticism that
Hemingway’s world is narrow and
monotonous.
“A Moveable Feast” was written be-
tween 1958 and 1960 and, apart from
some stories, may be the last substantial
work of Hemingway to see publication.
It recalls his years in Paris between 1921
and 1926 when he strove to free him-
self from journalism and become a
writer. It tells a good deal of his
struggle to develop the Hemingway
method of prose and something of the
people who influenced him during this
period, but surprisingly little about the
work itself; there is no reference to
“In Our Time” and “Torrents of
Spring”, though the visit to Spain which
produced “The Sun Also Rises” is men-
tioned as being in preparation. Some
of the characters which appear in it,
especially Ford Madox Ford, flit through
the pages. We may assume that “Three
Stories” and “Ten Poems” had already
seen the light before the time these
recollections deal with; at any rate
Hemingway is reticent about poetry
apart from a few uninformative asides
about T. S. Eliot and a very personal
homage to Ezra Pound, his close friend.
It is doubtful whether this book will
add much to our knowledge of Heming-
way the man. His novels and stories,
which he intended to be “more truthful
than life”, contain, I think, as much
about him as he cared to have under-
stood, but as a backward projection “A
Moveable Feast” succeeds very well. It
is, indeed, astonishing that he was able
to resurrect the lineaments of the past
with such freshness, even keeping in
mind that he often revisited the scenes
of his early battles. Most interesting is
the way in which he uses his mature
style and his firmly formed attitudes to
life to describe the days when style and
attitude—surely more congruent in him
than in any writer of our epoque—were
only beginning to come together.
But then, of course, Hemingway never
really describes: description is anathema
to him. His aim is to define through
exact observation and never through
analysis, leaving it to the reader to make
a whole out of the parts he presents to
him. Somewhat like a poet, he coils a
tight spring to be released in the other
man's consciousness. His uncompro-
mising adherence to this general scheme
gives the novels their unique flavor, as it
is responsible for their failure in the
field of ideas and human inter-action.
are certainly literature, and
A Pasternak is right in praising them
for the sheer physical density of their
subject matter, but it also limits their
content, their vision. Many a lesser
American think only of O’Hara
surpasses Hemingway as an “architect of
the soul”. When the soul at the centre
of the story is the author’s own the pro-
blem is accentuated. There is apparently
a point beyond which Hemingway would
or could not penetrate. He was no symbo-
list, but the casual symbols are there
again: fish, alcohol and the Hamlet-like
preoccupation with death, in his case
turning on Spain and bullfighting. Over
and over again, to the end of his life,
the same shadows are thrown on the
screen where they are outlined with sur-
passing sharpness, but the screen never
tears and we are never allowed to see
behind it, not even in autobiography.
He walks for hours across Paris, from
one bar to another, settling down in
Closeries des Lilas to work. He goes to
the races and fights against the gambling
urge, is sociable but irritated by the
demands of sociability; he is not strictly
hard up but he has to miss a meal
occasionally and this leads him to write
about the discipline of hunger. The
evocation of Paris as a landscape is fine,
though it is rather a timeless Paris. He
meets his cronies but, with one excep-
tion, grants us no insight into their
reality. It is the picture of an extra-
ordinarily self-engrossed young man
with a more or less literary view of
people, absolutely determined to become
a writer and almost obsessed with the
craft aspect. Through Sylvia Beach's
shop he discovers the 19th Century
Russian novel. He speaks of the in-
fluence of painting on his style, but not
in detail, and we do not encounter the
painters. Detached objectivity hardly
leaves him for a moment. Now and
then a thought seems to leap forward,
as when Gertrude Stein brings up the
lost generation.
“I thought of ..iiSs Stein and Sher-
wood Anderson and egotism and mental
laziness versus discipline and I thought
who is calling who a lost generation?
Then as I was getting up to the Closeries
des Lilas with the light of my old friend,
the statue of Marshal Ney with his
sword out and the shadows of the trees
on the bronze, and he alone there and
nobody behind him and what a fiasco
he'd made of Waterloo, I thought that
all generations were lost by something
and always had been and always would
be, and I stopped at the Lilas to keep
the statue company and drank a cold
beer before going home to the flat over
the sawmill.”
At this time Hemingway was not yet
thinking of “A Farewell to Arms”. But
the war was still close and we recognise
him clearly as the Jake of “The Sun
Also Rises”, the man with the war
wound who loves the aristocratic Brett.
You may recall that Jake is knocked
down by Cohn, the amateur boxer and
unhappy Jew who has written one book
and is trying to write a second. Heming-
way was himself keen on boxing—in
these pages we briefly see him sparring
with Pound—and I have an idea that
there is rather more of Hemingway in
Cohn than has been remarked on. In an
interview with George Plimpton he
denied that Jake’s injury has any deeper
significance than meets the eye, and ex-
cept for a few hostile references to post-
war capitalism there is nothing to remind
us overtly of the traumatic shock of
Caporetto, yet one gets the feeling all
through that there is something which
Hemingway wants to forget or save up
until later.


For once in his life he is domestically
happy. He is very much in love with
his wife, Hadley, and Mr Bumby, their
little son. This happiness is beautifully
revived, even if Hadley must talk like the
woman in “The Snows of Kilimanjaro”.
“Standing there I wondered how
much of what we had felt on the
bridge was just hunger. I asked my
wife and she said, ‘I don’t know, Tatie.
There are so many sorts of hunger. In
the spring there are more. But that’s
gone now. Memory is hunger’.”
Towards the end, holidaying en
famille in the Voralberg—which gives
occasion for a brilliant little vignette of
mountains and snow—their bliss is shat-
tered and another woman appears. The
way it is handled, however, merely em-
phasises how much Hemingway longed
to be a “normal” man and his suspicion
of lonely men of action (later he was
nearly to become one himself). This,
too, is probably bound up with his death
obsession, still held in check in the
early twenties. It was the fear of death
which forced him to confront a kind of
violence not compatible with the
“ordinary” life. The attraction of this
thing we fear so much has made many
a suicide.
Wilson’s Words
Purpose in Politics. Harold Wilson.
Weidenfeld and Nicholson. 51s.
T>rinted oratory makes for dull read-
A ing—yesterday’s half-baked pota-
toes. This is partly true of Mr Wil-
son’s book, compiled from twenty-odd
speeches made during the last seven
years, plus three Press articles. The
prose is clear but cliche- ridden. There
are many calls, “not only for new mea-
sures but for new men, who can lead the
nation to its rightful place in the world”.
Why should we read this?
One reason is that Mr Wilson may be
the next British Prime Minister, so we
need to know what he is like. His
speeches reveal few inner depths, but
at least they give us the image he
wishes to promote. “Purpose”, reiterated
in various forms, provides a clue. It
suggests a politics of coherent aim, to be
achieved by a unified will; it invites, and
sometimes gets, the prefix “moral”; it
evokes a bracing masculinity, ready to
inject into the “cosy stagnation” of a
flaccid, genteel, nostalgic Britain the
seeds of new life. “This is the time for
change, dynamic, exciting, thrilling
change”.
The world also perfectly suits the
double image that the Labor leader has
offered to his party —the young brisk
scientific reformer, but also the ruggedly
moral, God-fearing and egalitarian,
North Country man; dynamic and intel-
ligent, yet somehow safe; not an intel-
lectual, no frequenter of Hugh Gait-
skell’s Hampstead discussion - group
(Gaitskell gets fleeting mention as a pre-
cursor, but it is also made clear that
“Our Socialism” does not come “from
the London School of Economics or any
other seat of learning”).
The technocrat is much in evidence in
the most recent speeches. “The key to
Britain’s future” is “the purposive appli-
cation of modern science and technology
to our industrial life”. He reprints his
famous address on Science which is
said, appropriately enough, to have
electrified the 1963 Party Conference.
Elsewhere he maintains that “the central
thread of Labor policy ... is our plan
to mobilise the talents of our scientists
and technicians, redeployed from mis-
siles and warheads”; though with a
“leavening of humanity”. Automation,
computers, teams of chemical engineers,
are key items in the new socialist dis-
pensation. Even education is seen mainly
in the light of priority in training more
scientists and technologists, combined
with “fair shares”. Nationalisation
schemes are gracefully acknowledged,
but not dwelt on. The on-the-whole
sensible Labor plans for improved social
services are outlined in a reprint of a
1959 “New Statesman” article.
How does he also convey the impres-
sion of being a safe man? Partly be-
cause, for a dynamic person, he stands
on astonishingly few toes; and he is a
moralist who demands few specific
sacrifices more onerous than some delay
in the introduction of color TV. Vested
interests dear to Labor are protected—
the Beeching plan for railways in un-
necessary surgery, obsolete locomotive
workshops can be kept busy meeting the
needs of under-developed countries,
which we must help; though Britain
already “takes more than her fair
share” of Asian textiles. Hidebound
and lazy firms will be penalised, but
Lancashire cotton firms, old Highland
communities and agricultural marketing
boards must not be allowed to wither
away. The Government must “appeal
for, and . . . deserve co-operation from
every section of the community”,
aside from tax avoiders, property specu-
lators and bad landlords. Mr Wilson
is at his most euphoric about the Com-
monwealth. A ludicrous example of the
politician’s will-to-please occurs when
someone is quoted as saying that British
Socialism owes more to Methodism than
to Marx. “He was right”, adds the
author, “though the desire for allitera-
tion involved injustice to the equal con-
tribution of other religious denomina-
tions to the Socialist ideal”. Fair shares
for Anglicans?
Mr Wilson may well be correct in
wishing to inject a “stream of tendency”,
as Harold Laski called it, into British
political life. His speeches on economic
and foreign affairs are intelligent and
skilful performances. A politician in
public may be excused for not giving
handles to the enemy. Still, is it wrong
in this case to believe that one discerns,
behind the dynamically purposeful
image, the outline also of a shrewd,
cautious and hole-plugging conservative?

Faults of
Emphasis
The Modern Encylopaedia of Austra-
lia and New Zealand. Horwitz-
Grahame. £8 19s. 6d.
HThis 1200-page medley of information
A about all the matters which are
dealt with in encyclopaedias is an ambi-
tious venture which might be described
as a gallant attempt that did not quite
come off for want of proper balancing
and a wide range of advice. It carries
a list of persons and organisations “with-
out whose help the task of compiling and
checking the accuracy of so many facts
would have been far more formidable”.
It seems a pity that more use was not
made of some of these, especially since
the mention of their names gives the
impression that they have advised
generally in the branches of knowledge
in which they deal. My own name
appears among them, but the only part
I had in the production was to read over
the chronology and one or two other
small items, after they were in proof.
The work has a large biographical
ingredient dealing with the living as well
as the dead. Many of the early biogra-
phies are inadequate and ill-proportion-
ed. It is, for instance, insufficient to sum
up the last years of Governor Macquarie
by referring merely to his difficulties
with the judiciary and the Royal Com-
missioner in the period in which he was
engaged in a vast building, exploration
and development programme; in the
creation of new towns away from the
County of Cumberland, and of institu-
tions on which Australian civilisation is
based, such as the Bank of New South
Wales, the Savings Bank, the Benevo-
lent Society, Aboriginal settlements and
schools and so forth.
The biography of Macarthur is wrong
in almost every statement of real im-
portance. The fault that is most marked,
however, on the biographical side is a
lack of discrimination in selection of
entries and a lack of proportion in deal-
ing with them. Thus, living writers and
reporters of no importance and even
minor boxers and fight promoters are
found occupying more space than dis-
tinguished soldiers whose names will live
in history, and national figures whose


niches in the hall of fame are assured.
Thus, Stanley McCabe (“Australian
cricketer”) gets 45 lines, but Sir Iven
Mackay, one of our most distinguished
soldiers, gets 20. Ken Mac-
kay has a hero's welcome with his
notable innings recorded, but Captain
John Mackay, explorer, whose name is
on one of the largest cities in Queens-
land, is not mentioned; Barney Kieran,
who “at the age of 17 beat Dick Cavill
by 10 yards over 880 yards”, is awarded
an impressive slab; and William Kidston,
one of Queensland's most impressive
Premiers, father of much of its original
wage-fixing legislation and founder of
its University, is unknown to the en-
cyclopaedia.
Hannibal Macarthur, John’s nephew,
a man of little note, is written about
at length, but James Macarthur, a man
of great importance in the history of
responsible Government and his brother
Sir William (who was one of Australia’s
most distinguished botanists and its first
native one) are consigned to oblivion.
And it is the same in every walk of life.
Sir John Longstaff, one of the Com-
monwealth’s historic portrait painters
whose name will live, appears slightly
less important to the encyclopaedists
than Mr Bobby Limb, “comedian,
musician”.
A similar lack of balance and of in-
formation permeates the book from
end to end in nearly all subjects. Par-
liament gets a fleeting paragraph—less
than the Lord Motor Company or foot-
racing. Mount Morgan, one of the
greatest gold and copper mines of the
world with a history of mining and
extraction technology of interest
throughout the industry everywhere, has
a sketchy and uninformative little para-
graph, the same length as the one about
Mt Wingen, the “burning mountain”
north of Scone (NSW). It is given about
half the space devoted to the Myer
Emporium and David Jones Ltd. Nearly
as much is devoted to Sydney Harbor
Bridge as to Sydney—“the first city in
the Commonwealth” —itself.
It takes 40 lines to tell the wonders
(impending) of the Sydney Opera
House and of the great men connected
with it, 37 lines to describe Launceston
and only 65 to limn the features and
characteristics of the obscure village of
Brisbane in Queensland. Woodchopping
competitions in the show-ring seem to
be nearly as much of interest to Aus-
tralians as wool and quite as important
as wool-classing. And, similarly, the
“Western District, Papua” appears to
be a district of absorbing interest, while
the rich and versatile “Western District
of Victoria”, with all its history and
diversity of interests, is thought worth
only half a dozen desultory lines. Taking
into account what is not in the volume,
the non-essential and ephemeral that is
in it, and the imbalance of the whole
of the material, the work has a long
way to go to provide the one-volume
compendium with an Australian
emphasis which is so much needed.
Tlowever, as I have written, it was a
gallant attempt.

The Lenz Papers. Stefan Heym. Cas-
sell. 445. 9d.
Lenz Papers” is a mammoth
A 714-paged historical novel which
examines in minutest detail one abortive
little revolution which started in the
tiny operetta-like German Grand Duchy
town of Rastatt in 1849. However, in
doing this, it manages to throw light on
the course of all revolutions throughout
history, great and small, and tries to
show at the same time, why they must
often appear to fail and why they must
ultimately always succeed.
The title, “The Lenz Papers”, almost
invites misunderstanding, so before going
any further, it would be as well to state
that the book has nothing whatsoever to
do with the Lenz (Jacob Michael Rhein-
hold), the “Sturm und Drang ” poet. No
less a writer than Buechner has devoted
a “Novelle” to this Lenz and it would
take a very brave, if not foolhardy, man
to venture into competition. Nor are
the “Papers”, as one might at first
assume, some newly discovered manu-
scripts or unknown verse which had
vanished when the real Lenz went in-
sane and which have only now been
unearthed.
Both the Andreas Lenz of this book
and his collection of papers are clearly
inventions of the author Stefan Heym
whose own life-story, incidentally, also
sounds like something he might have
made up himself. Heym is a German
who fled from Hitler to the USA, served
with distinction in the American forces
in Europe and wrote a best-seller, “The
Crusaders”, based on his experiences.
Then “becoming disenchanted with the
American way of life”, he chose to re-
turn to Germany again, not to the West
but to the East, behind the Berlin cur-
tain. There he continues to write and
to publish in England and in Germany,
apparently equally at home in both
languages, if not in both countries.
Among other honors, the Germans have
awarded him the Heinrich Mann prize,
named after the lesser known of the
two Mann brothers, who was always
more left of centre than Thomas.
The chronicle of “The Lenz Papers”
is told in a sort of flashback. Two
American soldiers are camped in a
cemetery in Gettysburg on the eve of
their embarkation to fight the Germans
in World War 11. Here, one of them
discovers an old tombstone bearing his
own name, Andrew Lenz, and is sud-
denly unable to shake off the premoni-
tion that he, too, is about to die in battle
in Europe just as this ancestor of his
died in battle in the Civil War in the
USA.
As foreseen, the soldier is killed and
his widow forwards some papers to the
friend who had been with him in the
cemetery. They are a bundle of yellow-
ing documents, letters, cuttings and
maps pertaining to the century-old Ger-
man revolution which the Andrew
(formerly Andreas) Lenz of the tomb-
stone had brought with him when
escaping to America in 1849. As the
friend goes through these “Lenz Papers”
the story of that far-off revolt and that
Lenz unfolds again. The author clips a
paper to the top of every chapter where
it serves as a sort of banner headline
and as continuity for the more romantic
embroidery that follows.
Andreas Lenz soon emerges as every-
man’s picture-book revolutionary, the
eternal fighter for freedom, compounded
of a pinch of Robin Hood, a goodly
dash of Lrancois Villon and a dollop of
Ned Kelly and of all those other spirit-
brothers who have merrily thumbed
their noses at authority right down
through history. Heym obviously chose
the name Lenz as a symbol because it is
poetic German for “spring”; early in
the book he says, “Revolution—that's
a kind of spring, isn't it?”
He makes his first dashing appearance
in the novel as a soldier-poet in a disre-
putable musical-comedy inn in the little
fortress town of Rastatt, frequented by
bawds, vagabonds and informers. One
expects him to break into song at any
moment and one is not disappointed. It
is a revolutionary song, of course. All
over the country, in the little divided
dukedoms of Germany there is unrest
at injustice and oppression by the aristo-
cratic rulers. Unlike the English who
were concentrating on Industrial Revo-
lutions by this, they had not found the
art of having their cake, complete with
royal icing, and eating it, too.
Almost spontaneously, the revolt
breaks out in the army in Rastatt, with
Lenz to the fore. The first wave of the
uprising succeeds. The tyrants flee.
There is a brief glimpse of glory. The
people have won. Hurrah for liberty!
Soon comes the reckoning. To revolt
is one thing. To rule wisely afterwards
is another. What then happens in
Baden is exactly what has happened so
often in history. Among the liberators
the fight within the fight begins, the
jostling for positions, the greed for more
and more personal power, the internal
squabbles, the treachery; in short, the
human element makes itself felt.
“What about freedom?” asks Lenz . . •
“What shall I tell the people: that we
fought against one tyranny to fall under

another?” And finally the decline, the
traitors within and the traitors without,
the battles that are won in the field and
lost in the peace. There comes the last
stand in the besieged town, surrender,
mock trials and death for many. Look-
ing back, Lenz finds hope: “When all is
said and done, what remains of the
struggle? The changes it brought, for
better or worse—whichever—they melt
into the greater design of human deve-
lopment . . .”
In the best tradition of the historical
novel, the romantic fictional story is
woven through the background of hard
fact and is so popularly written that no
one is likely to have any trouble in fol-
lowing it. Lenore, the beautiful
daughter of a Jewish banker, and
Josepha, a red-headed prostitute, are
both in love with Lenz. while his friend
Christoffel is in love with Josepha. Lenz
is at first fairly impartial with his
favors, but finally settles for Lenore (a
reference to G. A. Buerger’s ballad?)
who follows him to the front as a nurse,
thus forestalling Florence Nightingale by
some years.
After the revolt fails, Lenz is among
those who are to be executed. However,
he is saved by Josepha. who has revolved
from bed to bed and is currently sharing
the Prussian occupation officers’. She
dies rather too heroically while helping
Lenz and Lenore to escape (one almost
expected an aria here, too). Migrating
to America, Lenz is killed in action in
that other revolution, the Civil War,
leaving offspring, a tombstone at Gettys-
burg and his “Papers”.
All the fictional characters, although
rather obvious in themselves, do come
very much alive; in fact, far more con-
vincingly than some of the historical
figures who appear at intervals through-
out the story, like Gustav Struve, and
particularly Marx and Engels (who were
then the editors of a Cologne news-
paper) all of whom, just because they
are authentic, the author has had to
handle with more restraint.

Under the Skin
William Dobell. James Gleeson.
Thames and Hudson. £7 7s.
books split up into two groups:
One type seeks to evaluate, define
and critically fix the artist, and the illus-
trations tend to be diagrammatic and
monochrome. The other type is usually
a picture book with which to remind
oneself of glories seen. The text is
usually warmly approving, filling out the
visual memory with marvellous scenarios
of the action (“The artist has caught
that supreme moment between discom-
fiture and awe as Zeus dumps a shower
of gold in Danae's lap”.)
James Gleeson’s book is of the latter
variety. It is a book obviously aimed
at the local market. The book abounds
with local references which would stun
an overseas reader. What Gleeson does
extraordinarily well is to take you by
the hand up to “Our Own Great
Painter” and show you that beneath the
skin of that big fat reputation is a big
fat genius struggling to be left alone.
Dobell has been stuck with too many
reputations at too many wrong times.
He was the focus of the war between the
reactionary painters of Sydney and the
“Contemporary Artists” of the 19405,
in the most antic court case about a
painting since Whistler v. Ruskin. He
was the unhappy witness of last year’s
art auctions when he became the most
expensive buy an art investor could
make in the sale rooms. (“Why don’t
they come to me and offer those
prices?”) He was reviled as a modernist
in the ’4os; now young men try to
make their reputations by pulling down
the “old reactionary”.
The court case part blinded Dobell,
left him temporarily lame and, more
importantly, shut off the staggering flow


of portraits which culminated in his
Archibald prize entry of 1944. Brian
Penton, Billy Boy and Joshua Smith:
I shall never forget that exhibition and
the way the three pictures brushed away
the irrelevancy of those camp-pie-faced
men distinguished in the arts or letters
which dutifully lined the walls. Nor
can anyone forgive the stupidity of the
result of the case that followed, or its
effect on Dobell.
Gleeson’s text concerns itself a lot
with Dobell as a personality, and with
good cause. He is still painting; there-
fore, it’s important to all of us that he
continues to do so, and if Gleeson is
accused of special pleading, he should
wear the accusation gladly. The fact
is that Dobell is affected to an inordi-
nate degree by adverse criticism, as was
shown when a Sydney critic attacked his
New Guinea paintings. He just stopped
work on them.
The book has a complete bibliogra-
phy, a list of all exhibitions, and several
errors, notably the frontispiece wrongly
described. It is irritating in that it dis-
cusses pictures not reproduced in its
pages (glaringly, “Billy Frost”), and in
that dimensions of pictures are not given
until the final catalogue—a silly mistake,
particularly in the case of the color re-
productions. The color itself is not good:
again and again reflections from the
photographer’s lamps have cast a
general blue haze over areas of the
paintings, seriously so in “The Cypriot”,
the right-hand side of “Storm Approach-
ing Wangi” and in some of the very
small paintings. Why local block makers
weren't used is a mystery; at least they
would have had some chance of refer-
ring to the original. This failure of the
publishers is spectacularly underlined in
“Dame Mary Gilmore”, who becomes
one of the first of the Yellow Hordes:
bad color correction has changed a
golden brown head triumphantly emer-
ging from a proud serene body to a
yellow blob stuck on a golliwog.
A reproduction should at least sug-
gest essential qualities of the painting
and its size. Reproducing small paint-
ings in the same size as the originals has
the effect of seeming to enlarge them.
Gleeson makes the statement that the
size of painting is of no moment and
that Dobell’s miniatures are as impor-
tant as his big gallery paintings, but in
this book slightly smaller reproductions
would have been as clear and still have
retained the jewelled fascination of the
originals.
The book is, despite its faults, your
own private retrospective exhibition of
Dobell's work. Guided and explained
by an extremely perceptive friend of the
court, it will look well on anyone’s
marble-topped coffee table.

Today and Yesterday
THE PLEASURES OF BENNELONG POINT
Sydney opera lovers are
” waiting thirstily for the Govern-
ment and lottery director to provide
them with a stage on Bennelong Point,
the earlier settlers had their drama on
Bennelong Point, called in the earliest
days of settlement Cattle Point but
now bearing the name of its greatest
tragedian, King Bennelong of Sydney
Cove.
Bennelong had an unlimited acting
range, from comedy to stark tragedy,
and was always ready to “let his mad-
ness rage”, so that the policy of the
Governor, who lived in Government
House where Bridge Street now joins
Phillip Street, had to be:
Therefore prepare you . . .
Hazard so near us . . . doth
[daily grow
Out of his lunacies.
While Bennelong was about, the
denizens of Sydney never knew when
they might look up to the heights of
the Point at the supplication of
“Help! Help, ho! Thou wilt not
murder me?” from some dusky
maiden pressed close by the irate
monarch snarling the aboriginal
equivalent of, “How now, a rat! Dead
for a ducat, dead!” and paving the
way for the entry of more civilised
dramatis personae armed with cut-
lasses and gyves.
The gifted Captain Watkin Tench,
Australia’s earliest Homer, has pre-
served for us the script of Benne-
long’s best performance played to the
whole settlement in November, 1790:
“Between twelve and one o’clock
Banelon, unattended, came to the
Governor at his house and told him
that he was going to put to death a
woman immediately . . . His Excel-
lency was so struck with the fierce
gestures, and wild demeanour of the
other, who held in his hands one of
our hatchets, and frequently tried the
sharpness of it, that he determined
to accompany him, taking with him
Mr Collins and his orderly sergeant
. . . When they reached the house on
the point, they found several natives
of both sexes, lying promiscuously
before a fire, and among them a
young woman not more than 16
years old, who at the sight of Bane-
lon, started and raised herself half
up . . . Snatching a sword of his
country he ran at her, gave her two
severe wounds on the head ... In
vain did the Governor by turns soothe
and threaten him; he seemed dead to
every passion but revenge . . . furi-
ously brandished his sword at the
Governor and called aloud for his
hatchet . .
So the theme developed, with Ben-
nelong’s subjects rallying round him,
till the trusty Lieutenant Henry Lidg-
bird Ball, RN, responding gallantly
as the Governor’s hail for help reach-
ed him on the deck of the little
Supply, was seen approaching, cut-
lass in hand, with an armed boat’s
crew.
“Unintimidated, unimpressed . .
the heroic Bennelong defied the Royal
Navy, affirming his determination to
cut off his victim’s head, come hell or
high admirals, and going into a dram-
atic narration which, as rendered by
Captain Tench, was worthy of Euri-
pides: “Her father was my enemy and
gave me the wound in my head; and
when I was down in the battle and
under the lance of my antagonist, this
woman contributed to assail me . . .
I have ravished her by force from
her tribe at Botany. I will part with
her to no one till my vengeance shall
be glutted.”
For two days it went on —the victim
and a Polonius sent off to hospital
under guard, the outraged King Ben-
nelong appearing at the Governor's
gate crying for his hatchet and trying
to strangle a sentinel; the moving
scene in which Sydney Cove King
meets Botany Bay princess in a scene
of love and amity, in which he
open-heartedly forgives all. And the
curtain falls amid a shower of well-
flung stones propelled by Bennelong’s
jealous Queen, who regards the young
lady from Botany as a hussy and her
husband as no better than the com-
mon run of spouses.
Today, vice-regal personages are
denied the excitement of such scenes,
but one could imagine a Governor
and his Secretary re-enacting “Ham-
let” on the Tarpeian Rock as they
assess the jumble of concrete and
crane which another melancholy Dane
has created at immense cost, at the
end of Bennelong’s Point below:
Hamlet: That’s almost in shape of
a camel.
Polonius: By the mass, and ’tis like
a camel, indeed.
Hamlet: Methinks it is like a weasel
. . . or a whale.
Polonius: Very like a whale!
Certainly not like an opera house
... as yet.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
More Emphasis on Credit Controls
Speculation on the Commonwealth Government's Budget
plans took a new turn when bond market long-term
yields rose to around £4 19s. p.c. The Reserve Bank
can influence the market whichever way it wishes. The fact
that bond yields have been allowed to go so high indicates
that the Treasury is not interested in supporting the market
and, indeed, is very firmly committed to monetary controls.
This, in turn, is taken to indicate that the Government
prefers to avoid any harsh measures in the Budget, hoping
to rely on the interest rate weapon plus the control of credit
through the banking system. On that assumption, those who
were previously anticipating direct tax increases in the forth-
coming Budget were inclined to breathe a sigh of relief.
They could be justified. On
the Federal Government’s cur-
rent policy of wanting to avoid
stop-go methods, it would be
unreasonable to expect heavy
tax imposts in the Budget.
Nevertheless, some form of tax
increase cannot be ruled out,
because the arithmetic of the
proposed Government expendi-
ture this financial year, includ-
ing the extra defence commit-
ments mentioned by Prime
Minister Sir Robert Menzies,
indicates that additional revenue
must be raised somewhere.
Otherwise the Treasurer must
budget for a deficit and works
programmes must be pruned.
Loan subscriptions may not
meet the required target, even
allowing for an improvement on
the very successful 1963-64 year
of loan raisings. Therefore the
prospect of tax curbs on public
spending, through excise duty or
in the sales tax field, must be considered.
These indirect curbs may be relatively painless, but it seems
too much to ask that the Government should ignore the
current rise in costs and the growing labor shortage.
A Sacred Cow or
Golden Egg ?
arguing against the possibility of an increase in sales
tax on motor vehicles suggest that the Government may
sta y its hand if the manufacturers and assemblers lift the
Australian content of vehicle components to the official target
of 95 p.c.
It would be a good deal for the Federal Government if
Imports of Office Machines
The graph shows imports of office and accounting machines
into Australia, monthly between June, 1963, and May, 1964.
Two 11-month periods in 1962-63 and 1963-64 are also
compared. Reactions of business-machine companies to the
decimal changeover are discussed in an article on page 60.
it achieved this persuasion without a big stick, because it
could save upwards of £BO million on the imports bill. Higher
sales tax on cars ostensibly would bring in more revenue but
could cut back revenue from other sources in the automotive
industry.
The Government, although it wants to maintain a healthy
automotive industry (because it is such a major industry and
employer of labor), also wants to see the public spread its
spending over a balanced number of industries, and to save
a little as well.
If it could achieve a dual objective of fostering a local in-
dustry (which is becoming an important export earner) and
discouraging imports, doubtless the Government would be glad
to leave well alone. From the
viewpoint of tax revenue, of
course, there is always the
temptation to raise sales tax
from 22i p.c. to, say, 25 p.c.,
which, it could be argued, is
only a token gesture and is un-
likely to stop people from buy-
ing a car.
Apart from revenue, however,
there remains the problem of
facing up to a situation where
local manufacturers have been
encouraged to invest millions of
pounds in plant and equipment
to produce local components.
Today those manufacturers are
facing the additional threat of
Japanese cars, which are mak-
ing a small but definite impact
on the local market. While wish-
ing to encourage trade with
Japan, the Federal Government
must adopt a consistent policy
to all car groups which do not
comply with the requirements
to use local components. To enforce this, the Government
can clamp down on imports which enter the country under
the by-law system and come under the administrative control
of the Customs Department. In fact, there are indications that
the Government will impose strict control as from January 1,
1965, in an effort to encourage the greater use of local
components.
Such control is by no means aimed at newcomers. Existing
manufacturers also import overseas models, or vehicles with
a high foreign content, so the tighter policy will affect Vaux-
hall (GM-H) and certain Ford makes. BMC, VW and Chrysler
have taken steps to lift their Australian content. It seems
obvious that the extent of co-operation given by the vehicle
manufacturers will determine the Federal Government's
attitude of benevolence to the industry.


Interest Rate of a
Different Color
officially inspired move towards dearer money in recent
weeks had a remarkable influence on at least one public
company borrower in the debenture market. Alliance Hold-
ings Ltd, a Sydney finance company in which the MLC retains
a 40 p.c. shareholding, changed its interest horse in midstream
and upped its interest rates by three-quarters of one p.c.
Alliance already had announced its terms of issue but changed
them. It is permitted to do this under the prospectus, directors
state.
The move followed that of H. G. Palmer Ltd, a wholly-
owned electrical subsidiary of MLC, which has just issued
a new prospectus with interest rates increased by one p.c.
Other finance companies with current debenture lists open
for public subscription are left in a bit of a flap. The giant
GMAC, which does the General Motors’ financing, has
lifted its rates by a quarter p.c. This may influence some
finance houses to close their present issues and make a new
approach to the public.
It is not so long since GMAC cut its rates. Then the gossip
around the town was that, if GMAC wanted to cut its finance
rates to the bone, it would make it extremely disadvantageous
(finance-wise) to buy a vehicle other than those handled by
GMAC.
Now that the bond market has given the nod for dearer
money, the trend is reversed, which means that some finance
companies at least are grateful that the rat-race for cheaper
finance won’t be as drastic as they feared.
Australia, Japan Urged Towards
Industry Integration
A few very lofty kites were flown by the “Modern Japan”
seminar held at the Australian National University in
Canberra last week. Yet. as trade relations between Australia
and Japan become more intimate, even the most far-fetched
schemes may be found to possess some elements of reality.
At any rate, one or two of the economist participants at
Canberra felt that talk about industrial integration was not
too far removed from feasibility. After all, both Japan and
Australia have an industrialist’s role to play in the Pacific
region in addition to their bilateral trading. Both countries
also appear likely to face shortages in one critical resource
at least—-skilled labor.
So the Professor of International Economics from Hitotsu-
bashi University, Tokyo, Dr K. Kojima, need not sound too
far off the beam in advocating complementary industrial
growth and separate specialisations to escape from “unneces-
sary duplication of industry”.
Naturally there was a sizeable measure of special pleading
in part of Dr Kcjima's seemingly detached remarks.
He did not attempt to conceal Japan’s desire to build a
much-needed expansion of exports around heavy manufactures
and chemicals. So far as Australian efforts in these two
spheres are concerned, the pill is to be coated with the tasty
attraction of an “enormous” saving in costs.
Nevertheless, competing industrialists might well see pros-
pects of a possible remedy in Dr Kojima’s proposed cure-all:
“To promote mass production of different kinds of sophistica-
ted manufactures, countries should come to some sort of agree-
ment, reciprocally furnishing the other market.”
In the light of the recent spate of criticism of BHP’s
allegedly “tardy” growth, it would be interesting to have the
company’s reaction to a suggestion that “one country might
concentrate on one or two types of steel, and the other country
on others, exchanging them with one another and sharing
third markets so that both could achieve large-scale production
and cost reduction”.
Dr Kojima’s forecast of increasing capital movements
between Australia and Japan certainly received support from
ANU research scholar Mr Peter Drysdale, who also spoke at
the seminar. In particular, Mr Drysdale saw greater direct
Japanese investment in the development of Australia’s fuel
and mineral deposits.
Looking at the American
Gift Horse
YJlTarnings that Australia should heed the Canadian experi-
ence of selling out to foreign interests received renewed
emphasis last week on reports that the takeover boom is
mounting again in Canada.
In just over five years nearly 160 companies have changed
hands to foreign owners, most of them US buyers. Foreign
investment looks good on paper, but the outflow of dividends
continues each year ad infinitum, Canadians complain.
Australia is having a similar problem. The enthusiasm
over the initial generous purchase price usually supplants any
doubts about the loss of assets, plus the disadvantage of having
an overseas policy decide if and where the local company may
export so as not to conflict with other similarly controlled
branches.
The 15 p.c. interest equalisation tax on foreign investments
is now law in the US and is retroactive to July, 1963. By
making overseas investments less attractive to Americans, it
was felt by the Kennedy Administration that the new tax
would stop the (light of US dollars and help close the dollar
gap. This may have made foreign equity investment less
attractive, but it encouraged US corporations to buy up over-
seas companies and set up branches in overseas countries with
the object of building up assets and accumulating profits
without remitting such profits by way of dividends.
This makes sense if the legislation expires on the proposed
date of December, 1965, and is not renewed. On the surface,
the US interest equalisation tax may curb the drain of dollars
to some extent. It will not cure the penchant to acquire
overseas assets.
NSW Government Chases
Overseas Industry
NSW Government is mounting another positive cam-
“*■ paign to entice more British and European manufacturers
to establish themselves in the State. A sortie in depth will
follow up the contacts made by the former Premier, Mr
R. J. Heffron, on his much publicised tour last year.
That tour has yielded firmer results than the mere window-
dressing it frequently seemed at the time.
To carry persuasion further, the NSW Agent-General in
London, Mr Buckley, is to be helped by PA Management
Consultants Pty Ltd, which has been working closely with the
Department of Industrial Development since June. One of
PA’s senior Australian consultants, Mr T. Cappie-Wood, left
for London last week. He will be away for a heavily engaged
eight months.
Interviews have already been arranged with previously
approached makers of heavy electrical equipment, hand tools,
crockery and air pollution prevention equipment. This latter
may prove to be promising in view of the clean air Act to
come into force next year.
Questions of Australian equity participation in any newly
established industry from overseas do not appear to be con
cerning the NSW Government very much at the moment
although the Department does evince a fondness for joint
ventures if possible.
It feels that the participation problem is something to be
tackled by the Federal Government, in due course.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Place of Monetary Policy
Recognising real merits in interest rate action
rpHE one p.c. rise in consumer prices in
the June quarter appeared to settle
any doubts held by the Reserve Bank
about engineering a rise in long-term
bond yields before the Budget. Even
without that evidence the case for lever-
ing up interest rates was impelling. If
the interest rate weapon is to be used
effectively in tempering high liquidity
and investment exuberance, the time to
act is before the outworkings of these
phenomena are manifest in the price
structure. So if any criticism is to be
made of the Reserve Bank's interest rate
moves these last few months, it is that,
once having decided in April that the
weight of overall investment threatened
to press too hard on resources availability
(particularly labor), it might have acted
more strongly before the May loan.
This is not to say that, given the
pointers available at that time, the Re-
serve Bank's interest rate moves were
necessarily too weak. Indeed, the Bank
was sharply criticised in the money
markets for taking any action at all at
that juncture when the picture of fixed
investment was far from clear and al-
ready strong SRD action had been taken
to neutralise excess liquidity. True, con-
sumer prices had moved up more than
usual in the March quarter and this
might have been taken as a stronger
warning signal for the authorities. Again
while Dr Coombs did not know how
much the Arbitration Commission
would add to the basic wage, he might
have made a shrewd and accurate guess.
Obviously enjoying his new-found
faith in the interest rate weapon, he was
probably at pains not to swish it about
too lustily lest he chop off the rising
head of prosperity prematurely.
Now' the investment upsurge is more
obvious, prices are rising faster and the
basic wage increase is in the book the
picture must be a lot clearer to the
authorities than it was in April. Though
the authorities have had it from the
National Bank that a dampener of econo-
mic activity is not necessarily appro-
priate, nonetheless we may well "be thank-
, ln due course that monetary policy
IS coming in ahead of the Budget with a
strong warning sign, which many are
taking as the first positive indication that
me Budget itself may well be a stern
document.
Then there is the manner of the latest
leverage in interest rates to suggest that,
in some distinction to the April moves,
the Reserve Bank appears to have been
trying to make a psychological impact
by operating more forcibly in the first
instance on the longer-dated bonds, ap-
parently with the thought that, even if
issued at a small discount, a 5 p.c. cou-
pon on the long-term tranche of the July
loan will give a strong impression of the
authorities’ dampening motives. Well
ahead of its official arrival via the July
loan, a 5 p.c. bond rate would appear
to have had a restraining effect on share
prices, while in readjusting interest rates
on some of their current new paper
some finance companies found they had
to dance to the same tune before the
fait accompli.
Dr Coombs must be pleased with
these side effects of his open market
operations and is probably regretting not
having appreciated the true merits of
interest rate action at other critical
periods for the economy in the last few
years. For instance, there was a golden
opportunity to have levered up interest
rates at practically any time in 1960,
when the most the Reserve Bank thought
fit to do to contain the advancing boom
was to tell the trading banks sternly to
watch their advances. Again, before the
1962 Budget, when The Bulletin and
others were strongly advocating central
bank action to reduce interest rates, the
opportunity was lost and nothing was
done until the following March, which
was far too late to get the best results
from such action. Admittedly, there was
no pre-Budget Commonwealth Loan that
year, but this didn't preclude open mar-
ket operations to reduce interest rates.
VTow, quite apart from restraining
effects on the economy which the
authorities are doubtless seeking to in-
duce through interest rate policy, there
is the further need to ensure that the big
conversion element in the Common-
wealth Loan is as successful as possible.
There is always a danger that, if investors
think bond yields will rise further, they
will postpone their investment or prefer
cash to conversion pending interest rates
settling down. This was well exemplified
by the under-subscription to the May
loan, as many investors chose the alter-
native of holding back their investment,
and subscribed in advance to the next
loan, which, as they accurately antici-
pated, would be at higher interest rates
than the May loan. If to uncertainties
about actual rates on loans there are
added further ones about changes in real
interest rates brought about by rising
prices, the need for the increased rates on
the latest loan can be better appreciated.
Of course, there can be no comfort
in the latest rise in interest rates for
those who look on the economy as
merely a social complex in which econo-
mic factors must be bent towards social
ends, irrespective of the consequent ex-
cesses of investment and the effect of
such excesses on effective demand and
so through to prices. Moreover, if inter-
est-rate policy is followed to its logical
conclusion in what one would expect to
be a period of further price increases, the
authorities would have to increase inter-
est rates even further to accommodate the
economic moves in the real rate of inter-
est, which is directly related in some
rough proportion to price increases. It
is better to suffer restrictions, say on
housing investment, brought about by
increases in interest rates, now than to
force prices up still further by letting
investment have its head at artificially-
low rates of interest.
jguT austere monetary policy can go
only so far in containing the posi-
tion. It will be up to the Budget to pro-
vide a further series of restraints to effec-
tive demand. In one respect, the increase
in interest rates should help the Treasu-
rer himself in his retaining exercise be-
cause, other things being equal (for in-
stance, if price movements are small), he
can expect a richer loan harvest at the
higher bond rates. If price increases tend
to weaken the propensity to save, as one
would expect, then the increase in bond
rates will help to offset this.
In fact, uncertainties about the pro-
pensity to save could be one of the auth-
orities’ main worries this year and could,
in part, account for their increasing inter-
est rates on Government loans at this
stage when prices are tending to rise.
Even with so many captive subscribers
to Government loans, the higher rates
could be decisive in determining the out-
turn of the loan market and, depending
on the scale of price increases, bond
rates may have to be lifted even higher
in the course of the year for the
Treasurer's loan targets to be realised.
If these are not fulfilled, then the only
alternative for the Treasurer would be to
increase taxation, which he would seem
bound to do in the coming Budget in
any case, both as a restraining measure
and as an aid to revenue to meet the
huge expenditure increases in prospect.


“CROESUS”
Snedden’s Vacuum of Silence
Insulating criticism of Restrictive Trade Bill
VTobody will blame the Federal Attor-
ney-General for wanting to get his
Restrictive Trade Practices Bill knocked
into shape with as little outside inter-
ference as possible. But one would have
thought that at this stage of putting flesh
and blood onto the bones of his pro-
posals, the more he lent an ear to criti-
cisms and advice from the business
world the better.
It is certainly hard to go along with
the things he said about the process to
the Master Grocers' Association of Vic-
toria at a function at Clayton in his
electorate last weekend, when he inti-
mated the Bill would be ready for pre-
sentation to Parliament in November.
Surely exception must be taken to Mr
Snedden's claim that “a piece of legisla-
tion as important and complex as this
cannot by its nature be discussed in the
public forum of the newspapers—the
multitude of policy decisions must be
taken step by step; if we formulated a
policy of answering all criticisms as they
arose we would lose view of our overall
purpose”.
The fact is that Mr Snedden is getting
away with an affront to the Press on this
matter. It is about time the Press woke
up to it, that is if it is not now too late
in the day. At any rate, it is to be hoped
that when the parliamentary processing
of the legislation begins in November
there will be strong public debate as
well. This is too important a matter to
be turned into law simply by the steam-
roller of a parliamentary majority.
TTowever, after working quietly in
what he called at Clayton his
“vacuum of silence”, Mr Snedden got
an unexpected sort of nod last week from
Mr R. W. C. Anderson, director of the
Associated Chambers of Manufactures.
Mr Anderson seemed to be saying that
industry would come to the christening
of a Restrictive Trade Practices Act if
only Mr Snedden would bury the Aus-
tralian Industries Preservation Act.
He said that while manufacturers
think further discussions are needed
with industry about the content of the
Trade Practices Bill, they believe efforts
to revive the Australian Industries Pre-
servation Act are misguided. They call
for its immediate repeal as they fear
Mr Snedden’s tests of its teeth. (It was
ironical that on the same day as Mr
Anderson's declaration in Canberra,
down in Melbourne the Meyer Heine
Line was taking out High Court writs
under the Act against two members of
the Conference Shipping Line.)
Obviously the manufacturers now
fear the consequences of new-found
fangs in the Australian Industries Pre-
servation Act, with its strong anti-
monopoly implications, more than they
do the emerging Restrictive Trade Prac-
tices Bill, which Mr Snedden has already
stated has had its anti-monopoly clauses
substantially watered dowm since the
original Barwick List B practices were
formulated. Perhaps the manufacturers
have forgotten that some months ago,
as one reported at the time (The
Bulletin, May 30), Mr Snedden told
the Victorian Employers’ Federation
seminar on restrictive trade practices
that there may come a time when the
Australian Industries Preservation Act
could well be repealed.
/Contrary to what Mr Anderson may
be thinking in his new line, that it
would be altogether too much to keep
the old Act alive and still have a Restric-
tive Trade Practices Act, one finds op-
position in the business world just as
strong as ever agaiinst having a Restric-
tive Trade Practices Act whatever the
Government has in mind for the old
Act.
One wonders, however, whether a big
employer-financed organisation like the
Institute of Public Affairs is now serving
any useful purpose in still attacking the
general idea of having a Restrictive
Trade Practices Act and whether its
efforts would not be better directed along
the lines of those of the Victorian Em-
ployers’ Federation to getting a Bill
more palatable to the business world.
Going on an article in its latest
quarterly Review, the Institute of Public
Affairs would seemingly like the
Attorney-General to retire hurt from the
restrictive practices pitch. While not
suggesting there are no abuses, no un-
fair and unethical practices in industry,
the IP A sees the Government’s proposals
in essence as “an attempt to alter radi-
cally a whole pattern of practices and
arrangements that have evolved with the
years and to impose on business a doc-
trine of competition out of harmony
with present-day realities”.
It says experience of other countries
and commonsense alike suggest that the
legislation must largely fail in its pur-
pose. “Apart from the great practical
difficulties of administration, no system
of law can ultimately succeed which
attempts to compel people to do what
they are not prepared to do because they
feel it to be opposed to their interests,
That is really why no country has legis-
lated to abolish restrictive practices in
trade unions, for which there is no more
and no less justification than restrictive
practices among businessmen.”
rTms is all well and good but it is not
A having much effect on the Attorney-
General, who has cast his die and in-
tends to stick to it. It is as well,
then, that the Victorian Employers’
Federation, for instance, has been plug-
ging away at trying to inject more sense
into the Bill —for example, to persuade
the Attorney-General to abandon the
whole idea of registration of restrictive
practices and the complicated processes
flowing from it and in its place adopt
the more workmanlike methods of New
Zealand and Canadian legislation in
which investigation of restrictive prac-
tices originates mainly from public com-
plaints about them.
The Attorney-General should certainly
have another look at the parliamentary
debates in New Zealand late in 1961,
when, after three years’ trial, the system
of registration was abolished in favor of
investigation through public complaint.
It seems that, in the three years’ period,
only 800 practices were registered and
this was considered to be only about
half of the number in existence. More-
over, the public showed very little inter-
est in examining them. As the Minister
said in the debate: “The agreements are
open to inspection b*' the people; a fee
of ss. is involved and I do not imagine
that this has kept anyone from inspect-
ing them, but we have collected only
two fees in the course of the last year.”
Only eleven cases were dealt with by
the Restrictive Practices Commission in
NZ before registration was dropped. Of
these only five came to light as a result
of registration. The remainder arose
not from examination of agreements but
from complaints received from members
of the public. In those circumstances
the NZ Government decided to drop
registration in favor of the method of
complaint. It admitted, however, that
the original requirement of registration
put an end to many restrictive practices
and also that it drove many others
underground.
The VEF is certainly doing the com-
munity a service in bringing such issues
to the attention of the public and the
Attorney-General alike. Its verbatim re-
port on its recent Melbourne seminar, at
which both the Attorney-General and
the Government Whip, Mr Peter How-
son, explained and amplified the inten-
tions of the Government, is worthy of
wide study before the Bill comes to the
House in November.

When it comes to moving mountains of any kind, no two financial problems are alike, no two
companies are similar in their needs. That's why it's our basic philosophy to find the best
ways, the most appropriate means to make money available to individual companies whose
progress contributes to the nation's progress. If you plan to move a mountain soon, and need
finance to do it, come and talk to us.

Decimals Pose Headaches
Business machinery sound in long term
tThiE changeover to decimal currency
in Australia is giving suppliers of
business machines big headaches, and,
according to some, dull prospects for
a while.
Yet, despite the immediate pre- and
post-changeover flat spots, they feel
assured of a bright future because of
what they call “awareness of manage-
ment to increased efficiency”.
Based on interviews around Sydney,
The Bulletin gained the impression
that various firms in the business equip-
ment field are not happy with the way
the Government is conducting the
changeover. Some executives describe it
as “bureaucratic”, “loaded with red
tape” and “confusing”. Moreover, it
is claimed that no firm instructions have
been given on how to carry out the con-
version programme, nor can definite
rulings be obtained on some aspects of
it. For instance, no definitive order has
been given on whether compensation
will be paid to convert franking
machines, typewriters and other machines
where the £ sign is still used.
Another complaint is the period
allowed for the changeover. No date has
been fixed for commencement. The
Decimal Currency Board says “it will
probably be before or during what we
call the conversion period”. About two
years has been allowed for the complete
conversion of business machines to the
decimal system. This will apparently be
done by zones. Some firms say they can
do it in much less than two years, but
because of the zoning system they will
have to employ extra staff for the actual
length of time allowed for conversion.
All Australia’s business machinery
(adding and accounting machines,
cash registers, typewriters, etc.) is im-
ported because of the high capital cost
of establishing a factory here to produce
such equipment. The effects of the
changeover are already reflected in Aus-
tralia’s office and accounting machinery
import bill, although this country will
not be operating on decimal currency
until February, 1966, at the earliest.
For the 11 months ended May this year
it totalled £14,259,000, compared with
the previous corresponding period’s total
of £13,661,000.
Suppliers of business equipment stress
they are not going to make a lot of
money from the changeover. “Because
of our higher labor costs here, the profit
margin will be in no way as great as
it was in South Africa,” one executive
said.
The changeover will cost the Federal
Government more than £3O million for
the conversion of about 240,000 business
machines, and compensation to the
owners of about 55,000 other business
machines.
Suppliers are concerned, in the main,
with three things: the increased labor
costs they will have to meet, increased
competition since Australia will be part
of the world market for decimal
machines, and slackening sales before
and after the changeover.
VTational Cash Register Co. Pty
Ltd, the largest single supplier of
cash registers in Australia, estimate it
would have to convert 71,000 cash
registers and 14,000 adding machines.
“Our biggest problem here is finding the
extra 300 staff we think will be neces-
sary to handle the conversions,” an
executive said.
“The short-term prospects of the
changeover are not bright. To attract
staff to what will be temporary jobs we
will have to offer them high wages.
Not only do we have to find more
trained staff, we have to find extra space.
“It is a most unsettling operation. We
believe decimal currency is a good thing
for the country, but no machine com-
pany would be well advised to support
the changeover. We have to support
300 more technicians who will be on a
short-term project and you can’t get
these sort of people if you don’t offer
a good incentive, since they’re going to
have to look for work in about two
years. It also opens the way for com-
petition. Companies from overseas will
come in and sell their machines just
to cash in on the conversion.
“When South Africa changed to
decimal currency they finished up with
a large number of different brands.
Once the changeover was effected, the
buyers often found themselves without
service. Another big problem will be
educating the public to decimals. Here
we will have an advantage over South
Africa. Television will play an impor-
tant role in letting the people know what
is going on they don’t have it in South
Africa.
“An interesting aspect of the change
to decimals in South Africa has been
the effect on selling. High-priced goods
such as cars, refrigerators and real estate
are usually quoted in £s, while the
trade-ins offered are priced in rands,
even though the pound is no longer
used,” the executive added.
The shortage of highly-skilled staff
for conversion work is a problem for
Burroughs Ltd, who say they will need
an extra 400 people to make the changes.
An executive said: “It is taking a lot of
planning and we are taking on people
gradually, though it is hard to find
people with the necessary technical know-
ledge. It means, too, that we will have
to give them some sort of incentive for
their relatively short term of employ-
ment.
“In the long term we will have to
meet increased competition from Con-
tinental makes of adding and account-
ing machines. Based on our South
African experience they will have a lot
of trouble, because the customers there
tended to stick with the traditional
suppliers of office equipment, and paid
little attention to new makes.”
Some firms are already using the de-
cimal currency system for their internal
accounts and some plan to change before
the new currency is introduced. Some,
anticipating the possible confusion the
changeover could cause, are gradually
introducing the decimal system to their
accounts. Consequently the sale of
decimal machines is not insignificant.
T>emington Rand-Chartres Pty Ltd,
which expects to convert about
30,000 machines, is not happy with the
changeover itself. It fears falling sales
from now until changeover date and after
that reduced sales, since the changeover
will discourage businesses from buying
new machines. “Our sales of sterling
machines are considerably reduced now
that firms know Australia is changing to
decimal currency. This means our in-
come is decreased and our sales staff has
little work to do,” an executive said.
“Although we believe decimal cur-
rency is good for the country, its im-
mediate effects will displease firms
supplying business equipment. After
the changeover, when owners have new
or converted machines which will be
guaranteed for three months, we expect
them to be reluctant to buy new
machinery. On top of this there is the
extra staff to be employed.
“However, we feel the change to deci-
mal currency augurs well for the busi-
ness machine industry in the long term.
Calculating machinery will be simpler to
operate and may mean that everyone
working with figures will have a desk
calculator. With the sterling system a
great deal of time is wasted in calcula-
tions which sometimes necessitate con-
verting pounds, shillings and pence to
decimal equivalents before the calcula-
tion can be made. The decimal system
will change all this,” the executive
added.
Despite the unhappy note sounded by
suppliers about their short-term pros-
pects, they must ultimately gain from the
increased business decimal currency ifl
Australia will provide.

MARKET POINTERS
Dearer Money Higher Yields
What is proper return on equities?
Tf the current trend towards dearer
money is taken seriously—and
there is no reason why it should not be—
then share market yields must come in
for closer scrutiny.
A common yardstick is to expect a
return on equity investments of about
2 p.c. more than bond yield. Or, put
another way, the effective return on
bonds, with the 2s. in the £1 tax con-
cession, can only be matched by a divi-
dend income approximately 2 p.c.
higher.
This is based on yield only and does
not consider extra benefits, capital appre-
ciation and the like.
Not everyone likes to use interest rates
as a hard and fast rule for their invest-
ments. But at least the investor must
recognise that dearer money has an
influence on the interest rate structure.
Companies in which he invests have
the extra burden of borrowing funds at
a higher rate of interest, which can re-
duce their profitability.
★ ★ ★
thNANCE companies can be affected by
fluctuating interest rates. It is a
nice situation for them if they can bor-
row money easily at low rates of interest
to replace maturing debentures borrowed
at higher rates.
This works in reverse, too. In good
times, however, finance companies can
afford to pay higher interest rates if
their turnover is providing a good mar-
gin of profit.
More significant in the profit and loss
account is the percentage of bad debts,
delays in recoveries of debts, reposses-
sions, etc.
The solid finance companies can do
quite well in times of dearer money.
If credit is tight, they usually get more
business.
★ ★ ★
T'here may be justifiable criticisms of
A BHP over its profit figures. There
are probably grounds for the argument
that BHP may not have grasped its
opportunities to export in the post-war
period.
Yet any company which can put such
huge amounts to reserves and finance its
capital requirements by retained profits
must at least gain the palm for pro-
gressive and profitable expansion.
If the company pauses in its huge
capital investment programme and dis-
closes profits which represent the bene-
fits of consolidation, the earning rate
must go considerably higher than those
recently published.
This steel complex also embraces ship-
building—the latest benefits of which
include two large bulk carriers. If the
steel giant ever wants to diversify into
other fields, it will be a force to reckon
with.
Certainly, its capital of £ll3m. is a
bit large for the local Stock Exchanges
to digest at this stage of Australia’s
financial development, though today’s
investments in plant and equipment will
look cheap in 10 years’ time.
Its popularity could rise again, par-
ticularly if overseas interests are whetted
once more. This time, however, it is
hoped that overseas buying (if it comes)
is orderly and temperate.

Marchant’s Uphill Battle
T\)R those who do not believe in pour-
* ing good money after bad, last
week’s developments in Marchant’s
struggle for life are probably considered
to be for the best. The directors failed
to raise a £300,000 loan to pay off
Esanda and get their company out of
receivership. So British Tobacco has
been invited to renew its original offer,
which Marchants is apparently prepared
to accept this time.
However, at the time of going to
press, shareholders’ fortunes are still
swinging in the balance. If the original
offer was renewed, they would collect
sixpence a share and creditors would
receive anything between 10s. and 19s.
in the £. Esanda was in the 19s. class.
Now that Esanda is in the box seat, and
not the directors, the outcome could be
rather different.
Although Marchants has invited Bri-
tish Tobacco to proceed with the origi-
nal offer, it has not done so. Instead,
a second offer has been made straight
to the receivers. Details have not been
disclosed, except for the fact that the
bid is only for the assets, not the com-
pany structure, i.e., the shares. In the
light of this fact, and the statement that
the offer was the same in total as the
original one, we can conclude that
Esanda intends to get its full 20s. and
shareholders will get nothing.
Whether this situation exists or not
rfiay be known by the time this issue
reaches the streets. Even if shareholders
do get nothing from the new bid, their
shares could be worth something. Only
the annual accounts for the year to
March 31 will reveal this.
In their absence, there is little to be
said. If British Tobacco buys the assets
and Esanda collects its dues, all share-
holders will have to sell is the famous
“Marchants” name, tax losses resulting
from £340,000 the company has lost on
trading to March 31 (plus any losses
since), and a few remaining assets which
Esanda may not need to grab. The
balance sheet will give some indication
as to whether these items exceed or fall
short of the amounts owing to the re-
maining creditors.
The balance sheet can only give an
indication of this position. It does not
necessarily follow that directors can sell
what they have for what the balance
sheet says it is worth. Then again, they
may realise more from a sale than the
balance sheet indicates.
Of course, overriding all this is the
fact that Esanda and the receivers may
feel compelled to accept only 19s. in the
£, so leaving a residual for the share-
holders. Who knows? Business is
business and all that, but Esanda has
been very lenient toward Marchants
before and could easily be so again.
Blooming Brambles
marks to Brambles Industries
Ltd, Sydney - based haulier and
engineer, for progress made in the year
to June 30—complete proof that it is
out of the rough patch encountered in
the recession days of 1961-62.
The company reported a profit of
£720,182 compared with £540,042 in
1962-63. This figure may be subject
to revision by the Press to the extent of
capital profits or losses on the sale of
fixed assets. The 1962-63 figure quoted
above was after losses of £36,901, so
the true net trading profit was £576.943,
or 25.4 p.c. on capital.
The apparent earning rate on present
information for 1963-64 is 30.1 p.c.
and looks good in comparison with the
21.5 p.c. earned in 1961-62, which gave
such narrow cover for the traditional
20 p.c. dividend.
Depreciation charge goes up from
£753,696 to £1,003,000. In the 1963
accounts, vehicles, mobile plant, machin-
ery and equipment were shown at
£4,680,041 less provision for deprecia-
tion £799,172. Owing to an internal
rearrangement, the values of certain
fixed assets had been withdrawn and
reinstated as purchases during the year
at new opening values equivalent to the
net written-down tax values at which
they were transferred.
Tax provision was exceptionally low
for the two years 1962 and 1963. At
£288,649 for 1964 it is still low relative
to the profit, because of past accumu-
lated losses in subsidiary companies.
Those who hung on or bought in
during the less prosperous days of
1962, when the ss. shares were driven
down to about 125., are rewarded for
their faith in seeing the shares at the
current level of about 235.
Prestige Tackles Costs
A good 60 p.c. of last week’s company
reports included references to the
problem of rising costs and the basic
wage increase. Most of them used these
references as a qualifying statement to
predictions made about the future, while
some could only see a solution through
increased selling prices.


SHARE OPTION TRADING
BECOMING POPULAR
The buying and selling of options on stocks
and shares has long been a significant invest-
ment activity in England and America. Until
recent times Australians had paid little atten-
tion to the various methods of using Put and
Call Options to achieve profits and, at the
same time, to safeguard their investment deci-
sions. One simple example of how you can
profit from option trading is. . . . You arrange
an option to buy some likely shares (say within
three months). If, as you anticipated, the
shares rise in value at some time during this
period, you will then exercise the option. This
means that you obtain the shares at the lower
price prevailing when the option was arranged.
Thus you profit to the extent of the value
variation.
On the other hand, should the shares not
rise as you expected, or even fall in value
during the option period, you will let your
option expire. All it will have cost you is the
small premium paid for the option. You will
not have lost on the falling price of the shares.
The various methods of how people profit from
Put and Call Options are explained in a
brochure available from—

So it was rather a relief for share-
holders in the Prestige-Holeproof hosiery
and lingerie combine to hear from their
chairman, Mr G. G. Foletta, at the
annual meeting that the cost problem
was being tackled positively. He said the
group was going to need all its ingenuity
to maintain margins costs in the
group’s first three months of 1964-65
had kept profit improvement below that
achieved by the considerably higher turn-
over.
However, benefits were now rolling in
from a new plant which cost the group
£717,000 last year. More new efficient
plant to the tune of £1 million was now
being installed or on order. Savings
should go a long way to offset wage rises.
Mr Foletta’s confidence as to the
ability of his company was more posi-
tively reflected when he said, “Averaged
over the industry, the increase in the
basic wage will not be reflected in higher
prices.” In fact, he was sure that, over a
relatively short period, reductions in sell-
ing prices would exceed rises.
CAGA Hastens Slowly
22 p.c. lift in CAGA’s profit for
the year to June was necessary to
hold the modest earning rate on capital
increased by a one-for-four issue at 2s.
premium.
Earnings of £651,930 were 13.8 p.c.
on capital, and the usual 10 p.c. divi-
dend is dispensed to shareholders.
Net receivables have increased from
£32.2 million to £40.2 million, the
greatest advance being in contracts
where charges are not written in-—up
from £8.4 tc £13.7 million.
Notable events in CAGA’s year were
the purchase of a 48 p.c. interest in Aus-
tralian Equity Corporation Ltd and the
sale of 65 p.c. of CAGA’s interest in
Commercial and General Insurance Ltd,
which had been a wholly-owned subsi-
diary.
The ss. shares of CAGA sell around
10s. 9d. to yield 4.6 p.c. The market
is underpinned by the fact that 40 p.c.
of share capital is held by the Commer-
cial Banking Co. of Sydney.
Kinnears’ Results Misleading
Oometimes one wonders if company
directors care at all about what the
market thinks of their company. If they
don’t care, then their attitude to share-
holders cannot be very considerate
either, as market opinion plays a domi-
nant role in determining the value of
scrip which the shareholders own.
Back on May 26, Kinnears Ropes an-
nounced in a preliminary statement to
the Stock Exchange that profits had
declined from £158,000 to £149,000 in
the year to February 29. Normally this
announcement would not be particularly
disturbing. However, as the Melbourne
“Age” pointed out, the decline repre-
sented a reduction in earning rate from
12.1 p.c. to 9.6 p.c.—giving “scant cover
to the 9 p.c. dividend rate, paid for the
tenth successive year”.
With dividend apparently in such
danger, shareholders decided that things
were looking unhealthy and their shares
were cut on the market from 19s. (cum
div.) to 16s. (ex. div.) in the eight weeks
between May 26 and Tuesday of last
week, when the full balance sheet was
made available.
This document revealed that a capital
loss of nearly £14,000 was included in
the lower result. Such losses (or gains)
are not included in the numerous ac-
counting calculations which determine a
company’s true performance during its
financial year. This is mainly because
they can vary widely from year to year
and, if included, can badly distort one’s
view of performance. For example, in
1962- Kinnears’ capital losses were
only £504.
So, the company’s true profit for the
year was £163,000, not £149,000. This
represents an improvement over last
year's £158,000, not a decline. More-
over it boosted the earning rate from
12.1 p.c. to 12.3 p£e. This means that
the dividend was better covered than it
was last year. Because directors had not
included the capital loss figure in their
preliminary statement, the Press and
investors were badly misinformed as re-
gards the firm's state of affairs and
shareholders suffered considerably on
the market.
There are probably many who actually
sold out to reduce their holding. Such
moves have now proved to be a com-
plete waste of time and money—unless
they manage to buy back in at a lower
price than that at which they sold.
The directors must have known what
effect their announcement would have
on the market. Now we don’t want to
jump to conclusions, but there is an ex-
planation needed somewhere along the
line if shareholders are being considered
at all.

In the year to June, 1963, profit of
£89,119 was about half its previous
level. That represented only 11.1 p.c.
on capital, compared with the dividend
of 10 p.c.
Although final figures will not be
known until the end of October, directors
warn that 1964 earnings will be dis-
appointing. In their opinion, results for
1964-65 will be satisfactory.
Directors explained that insufficient
allowance was made for the extreme
difficulties in carrying out contracts in
distant and isolated parts of western
and northern Queensland. A shortage
of suitable labor and complete lack of
mechanical equipment for hire or sub-
contract at reasonable rates aggravated
the situation.
This presumably refers to the con-
tracts for beef roads, won in 1963.
The setback should be a salutary
lesson to investors (and the company)
that all engineers are liable to err in
contract estimation.
Well-flavored Issue
rFREMENDOUS self - confidence oozes
from Keith Harris and Co.’s state-
ment that it is making a bonus in view
of the company’s sound financial
position.
The severing of the link with Fir-
menich et Cie, for which Harris acted
as selling agents, does not disturb Keith
Harris, even though that Swiss company
has gone into Australian operations on
its own account.
The bonus, to be made in October in
the ratio of one-for-four ss. shares held,
follows one-for-six bonus distributions
in October, 1961, and 1960.
The Swiss company would have made
about 170 p.c. capital profit from its
original investment of 82,500 shares,
costing 19s. less than four years ago.
Other shareholders of this NSW
essence-maker would have no grounds
for complaint either.

Pioneering Reconstruction
lAividend from Pioneer Sugar Mills

p.c. premium.
The rate had been 16 p.c. until the
last year to December 31, when earn-
ings were 81.7 p.c. on capital.
In October, directors will announce
plans for reconstruction of the com-
pany’s capital. The scheme is presumed
to be the formation of a holding com-
pany with a considerable oonus element
for shareholders.
Meanwhile the company proceeds with
its £l| million expansion programme to
handle the increased assignment granted
at the Sugar Enquiry.
The 10s. shares go ex rights to the
issue on August 6. The cum rights price
of 695. indicates an ex rights price of
around 645., which would yield 2.8 p.c.
on the promised dividend.

directors said.


PRESTIGE LIMITED
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
The following is an abridgment of the Address delivered by the Chairman,
Mr. Geo. G. Foletta, at the Annual General Meeting of Prestige Limited held on
27th July, 1964.
It is a privilege, as Chairman, to move
the adoption of your Board’s Annual
Report and Balance Sheet, which discloses
a consolidated net profit from trading of
£567,660, after providing £514,092 for
depreciation and £437,445 for taxation.
HOLEPROOF INDUSTRIES LTD.
As was said in the Directors’ Report,
the achievement of singular importance
for the year was the purchase of the
whole of the ordinary capital of Hole-
proof Industries Ltd. However, as that
report covers fully the benefits your
Directors anticipate will accrue from the
acquisition, all that is left for me, under
this heading, is to welcome publicly this
eminently successful group of companies
into the Prestige family, and also to wel-
come Holeproof’s Managing Director, Mr.
A. G Eastwood, to a seat on the Board
of Prestige Limited.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
On this important matter, I refer
shareholders to the annual report, which
deals adequately with the source of profits
and their allocation, and all I would
like to add to that report is that the con-
solidated profit of the enlarged group was
fully in line with Directors’ anticipations
at the time it was decided to seek the
amalgamation.
FINANCE
Under the heading “Group Financial
Position” your Directors reported as fully
as possible on the information then avail-
able. However, I can now report that the
£500,000 resulting from the issue of 61%
preference shares has been applied to
the reduction of short-term liabilities, and
that we are now in the process of con-
cluding negotiations, under which the
balance of all bridging finance will be
replaced by long-term secured borrowings
from financial institutions to the extent
of £1,250,000 for ten and fifteen year
periods at 7% per annum.
GENERAL
Excepting to confirm the confidence
expressed in the Directors’ Report in
relation to long-term growth prospects,
rather than make optimistic forecasts, I
would prefer to supply indicators and
draw attention to the problems we could
face this year.
Favourable indicators are the con-
siderable increases in turnover and profits
registered for the first three months.
However, so as not to be misleading, I
must also state that, averaged over the
whole group, the rise in profit is some-
what less than the increase in turnover,
and, due to cost rises resulting from
increases in the basic wage, it will need
all the ingenuity that management can
muster to maintain margins.
We appreciate that the aim of the
Court, when granting the increase in the
basic wage, was to enable employees to
enjoy the benefits of rising productivity,
and as we have no desire to minimise
those benefits, our aim is to find ways
and means of absorbing the increased
cost.
To that end, we anticipate obtaining
considerable benefit from the new high
efficiency plant on which we spent
£716,811 last year, most of which, due to
the time lag attendant on installation,
made but a small contribution to reduced
costs last year.
However, any fall in demand which
reduces production below efficient levels
can be very costly, and for this reason:
The cost of high efficiency plant, in
terms of depreciation, interest, and
servicing charges, unlike labour cost, is
one which cannot be reduced in line with
production.
In this regard, we are pleased to have
Mr. Holt’s assurance that any action the
Government may deem it wise to take to
prevent a recurrence of inflation will not
be aimed at curtailing the sound develop-
ment of the industrial economy. This
assurance sustains our confidence that
your companies will continue to operate
at efficient and profitable levels of pro-
duction.
However, casting our minds back to the
1960-61 era, it was those divisions of
secondary industry whose productions
compete with imports which felt the
impact of deflationary measures far more
severely than most sectors of the economy.
Clothing and textile prices have shown
reductions some considerable every
year since 1960-61 until, for your group
of companies, the average price is the
lowest registered for more than a decade.
I believe this applies equally throughout
most divisions of the clothing and textile
industry. Moreover, there is considerable
unused capacity, and more than adequate
labour available (particularly female) to
meet any foreseeable improvement in
demand. In such circumstances, the
maintenance of buoyancv in these in-
dustries will not fan inflation
PROTECTION
When reporting last year, I acknow-
ledged the statesmanship inherent in the
Prime Minister’s approach when deliver-
ing the Sir John Storey Memorial Lecture
some time earlier. In outlining the
responsibilities of the Tariff Board, Sir
Robert left the nation in no doubt that
he completely agreed with sustained
development by industrial expansion. In
this regard, the approach of the Govern-
ment had already become evident when,
recognising the time - consuming nature
of full investigation and report by the
Tariff Board, it created temporary tariff
machinery. Despite the delays and
occasional disappointments relative to the
measure of protection granted, I retain
my faith in the Tariff Board.
As mentioned in your Directors’ Report,
since the beginning of the year our Yarn
Processing Division has obtained an
interim tariff, and as has alwavs been this
company’s experience, the added protec-
tion enabled that division to increase its
productivitv. operate profitably, and re-
duce considerably the average level of
prices.
The interim tariff over rayon piece-
goods assisted in maintaining demand.
However, due to keen competition and
lower prices, profits in this division were
reduced bv 8.6%. In its application to
the Tariff Board, the ravon
industry has sought a wider field over
which to operate, but as this matter is
now receiving the Board’s consideration,
I shall make no further comment.
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A return to the approach to national
development which governed the think-
ing of far too many Australians prior to
the Statute of Westminster would not
be acceptable to the great majority of
Australians today, whatever their political
affiliations, nor would it be in line with
the policies so consistently enunciated by
our Prime Minister and his Deputy, the
Minister for Trade, Mr. McEwen, who
carries the major responsibility for both
industrial development and trade, must
be frequently embarrassed by the undue
measure of publicity given to the propa-
ganda of that relatively small minority
which aims to restrict the development of
labour-intensive industries, and the textile
industry in particular.
Mr. McEwen has the confidence of an
overwhelming majority of all industrial-
ists, and his approach to development has
the support of employees, with the ex-
ception, maybe, of the few who still
follow the extreme Left of Labor.
Admittedly, Australia must not only
maintain but also considerably increase
her income from exports, and to this end
there must be reciprocity in trade. What
is less obvious is how much better off
will be those good customer nations who
enjoy M.F.N privileges, when they can
command their share of the great ex-
pansion in trade associated with speedy
national development.
When speaking last month to the In-
stitute of Directors in Melbourne, its
London Chairman, Mr. Paul Chambers,
an eminent scientist and economist,
supplied statistics relative to the post-
war growth of many countries, which put
it beyond all doubt that world trade in-
creases in proportion to the growth of
secondary industry in developing nations.
During 1961 I presented figures at an
international conference on the need for
secondary industry and trade by the
underdeveloped world, and these show
conclusively that, at constant prices, and
averaged over the ten post-war years
1949-1959, Australia’s imports increased
by 98.2% over the average for the
immediate pre-war decade.
These statistically based examples con-
firm the value of a rapidly developing
Australian economy to those nations who
seek our trade. However, such nations
should refrain from pressing Australia to
limit the expansion of labour-intensive
industry. Also in this regard Australia
must resist pressure by those local
minorities whose propaganda does little
more than disturb international relations
and embarrass the Government as well
as the Department of Trade.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
It gives me pleasure to extend the
Board’s thanks to the staff and employees
of all companies within the group, and
I particularly wash to express your
Board’s appreciation of the help received,
following acquisition, from the Board of
Holeproof Industries Limited under the
chairmanship of Mr. V. T. Gladstones.
Finally, I know that shareholders would
wish to join me in thanking my Co-
Directors for their excellent services
rendered during the course of a momen-
tous year.

As long as shareholders moan when
earning rates drop immediately after an
issue and think they are being diddled
unless there is a decent margin between
issue price and market price (in this case
it was only 2s. 6d.), one can’t blame
directors for making such a move.
Of course, earnings may suffer from
the placement, seeing “some time” is
needed before adequate returns roll in.
But as the shares could be placed so
close to the market price, the increase
in paid capital is less than would have
been involved if the same amount of
cash was raised from shareholders.
Wangaratta Recovery
YyANGARATTA WOOLLEN MILLS has Well
" and truly recovered from its gigan-
tic 1961 setback. Profit in that year
crumpled from £99,000 to £14,000. In
1962 it recovered to £36,000, then
£63,000 last year and the latest term to
May 31 produced £103,000, a record-
breaking result.
Shareholders will be collecting a 12i
p.c. dividend. Last year it was 10 p.c.
and, in 1962, 6i p.c. The payout is
amply covered by the earning rate, which
jumped substantially too, from 15.1 p.c.
to 25 p.c.
The big question now is whether this
wool and synthetic yarn spinner can
keep this trend up. The killing factors
back in 1961 were, of course, the credit
squeeze and, more importantly, the re-
leasing of import controls. As both these
factors appear rather remote at present,
the future looks good for shareholders
and the company.
Whale Survives on Land
’|l/’hale Industries Ltd is proving to
" be something of an amphibious
beast. It is back on the dividend lists
again after earning 9.6 p.c. on capital
from its cereal harvests and wool clip
in the nine months to June, 1964.
After incurring a loss of £221,000 in
1961-62 whaling activities ceased. The
company turned to grazing and the
growth of wheat, oats, barley, linseed
and sorghum.
For two years dividends were passed.
Now the company, having survived the
curious metamorphosis, is able to
pay 5 p.c. to shareholders.
The shares traded up to par in
response to the news.
Engineer Prospers
"Delative newcomer to Sydney lists,
J. Kohler and Sons Ltd, has aug-
mented last year's dividend of I2i p.c.
by an additional f p.c. for the final pay-
ment in respect of the year to June 30.
The total payment this year is 13£ p.c.
from earnings of 26.2 p.c. Net profit
advanced from £21,240 to £26,238, a
record result.
The ss. shares leaped on quote to
13s. 6d. buyer, 16s. seller, after selling
previously at 135., when the preliminary
results were announced.
Trying a New Field
unhappy news comes from
W. W. Campbell and Co. Ltd, Syd-
ney furniture retailer and hardware
wholesaler, in relation to trading for the
year ended July 31, 1964.
A loss was incurred, of unknown size,
for this, the fourth year in succession.
Although directors tried to comfort
shareholders last year with the informa-
tion that reserves covered dividends for
more than five years, it now transpires
that most of the reserves are more or
less absorbed. (An interim preference
dividend was paid, taking £3125.)
To avoid the heavy losses of a liqui-
dation, directors have decided to diver-
sify into the storage of business records.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
D. Jones Priced Fairly High
Expansion must affect dividend income
Tt is now three months since David
Jones Ltd acquired Foy & Gibson
(WA) Ltd and the market seems to have
absorbed the four million shares placed
with hardly any variation in the market
price. This is somewhat surprising, as
this new issue represented an increase in
ordinary capital (including convertible
notes but excluding employees’ shares)
of over 11 p.c.
According to the published figures,
Foy & Gibson (WA) only made suffi-
cient profit in 1962/63 to cover the
preference dividends and leave £360 over
for the ordinary shareholders. The an-
nouncement by Cox Bros suggests that
all liabilities were taken over, so one
must assume that Foy & Gibson lia-
bilities to Cox Bros, which stood at
just under £345,000 at July 31/ 1963,
have to be repaid. Clearly, David Jones
would not have paid £4 million to
acquire revenue of £360 per annum.
Even if we assume that the 1961/62
figures are a better indication of the
earning capacity, the return on the £4
million is only 3.8 p.c. and the earnings
in this year were the highest ever.
Certainly in terms of nominal capital
issued, the earning rate is 15.3 p.c. but
this does not seem to me to be a very
good yardstick. Furthermore, mainten-
ance of the dividend rate at 12i p.c.
will mean that, treated as an individual
transaction, there will be very little
“plough-back”.
Tt must, therefore, be assumed that
David Jones believes that, using its
own methods and facilities, the profit
from the Foy & Gibson (WA) assets can
be raised quite substantially. It is fairly
common in acquisitions for the
“acquirer” to seek a return such that the
earning rate on the nominal capital
issued will not be less than the earning
rate on the ordinary capital existing
prior to the acquisition. Whether, in the
case of David Jones, any allowance
would have been made for the issue of
convertible notes which will become or-
dinary capital at the end of this month
is difficult to say. If we assume that this
was done; then it seems likely that David
Jones believes that Foy & Gibson (WA)
earnings can be lifted from (let us
assume) a level of about £155,000 to
about £240,000. This represents an in-
crease of 55 p.c. and is therefore quite
substantial.
So far as it is possible to judge, net
profit before tax as a percentage of sales
has been running at the rate of about
5 p.c. in the case of Foy & Gibson over
the last four years. This assumes that the
situation so far as the 1962/63 year was
concerned was abnormal. While David
Jones has given approximate turnover
figures for several years up to and in-
cluding the 1960/61 year, these figures
have been omitted for the last two years.
During the four-year period 1957/58 to
1960/61, the following relationships to
turnover can be established in very
general terms:
PERCENTAGE OF SALES
Year to July 31 1958 1959 1960 1961
Earnings 3.2 4.0 3.9 3.8
Net profit before tax
and depreciation 6.0 7.1 7.7 7.3
Fixed assets 21.8 21.8 21.8 27.1
Total capital funds 34.2 35.2 35.8 40.8
Stock 15.9 15.7 15.1 15.9
Debtors 10.4 11.1 11.9 11.7
From these figures one could gain the
impression that the figure most closely
related to turnover would be the stock
figure, particularly if we allow that the
1960 year (to July 31) was rather more
buoyant than the others. Making this
assumption and recasting the figures to
exclude the stock provision of just over
£1 million disclosed in the 1962
accounts, one would estimate turnover
at £5O million in 1961/62 and £6l
million in 1962/63. These figures seem
to represent very substantial increases
and one can only wonder if they are
correct. If they are then applied to ex-
tend the table above, the percentages
would be:
Year to July 31 1961 1962 1963
Earnings 3.8 3.5 3.1
Net profit before tax
and depreciation 7.3 6.4 5.8
Fixeed assets 27.1 33.2 30.4
Total capital fund 40.8 41.4 36.9
Debtors 11.7 11.1 11.4
The factors that could have contri-
buted to the “guesstimated” increase of
£lO million in the 1961/62 year would
be the acquisition of T. C. Beirne Ltd of
Brisbane and the opening of the Parra-
matta store in the outer Sydney suburbs.
Judging by the net profit before tax of
T. C. Beirne prior to acquisition and the
floor area of the Parramatta store, and
making some allowance for natural in-
crease in sales, one would feel that the
increase over the 1960/61 year could
hardly have been more than £7 million.
So far as the 1962/63 year is con-
cerned, turnover would have been in-
creased by the completion of the altera-
tions to the Adelaide store and to some
extent by the opening of the Canberra
and Brookvale stores. Furthermore,
retail sales in the States where David
Jones stores are established showed quite
substantial increases. Again one would
feel that the increase of £ll million is
rather on the high side and a figure of
between £8 million and £9 million is
more realistic. Using these figures for
sales, instead of those based on stock,
the table would become:
Year to July 31 1961 1962 1963
Earnings 3.8 3.7 3.4
Net profit before tax
and depreciation 7.3 6.8 6.4
Fixed assets 27.1 35.4 33.7
Total capital fund 40.8 45.0 41.0
Stock 15.9 17.4 18.5
Debtors 11.7 11.8 12.6
J|Ven if one can accept this second
table on the basis that the apparent
slowing down of stock-turn is due largely
to stocking up of new stores and that the
slowing of the debtors turnover is due
to extended terms, one still comes to the
conclusion that profitability has been de-
clining since 1960. Again the expansion
oyer this period must in itself have
created increased costs which could not
be passed on.
This expansion seems to be continuing,
and apart from the Foy & Gibson (WA)
Ltd acquisition, the Wollongong store is
to be rebuilt, the George Street, Sydney,
store is being modernised and a new store
is to be opened in the Bankstown shop-
ping centre. While this expansion contin-
ues, shareholders can hardly expect any
major improvement in their dividend in-
come. Over the last eight years only 43.9
p.c. of disclosed earnings have been dis-
tributed and the distribution rate was
highest in 1957/58 when it reached 46.7
p.c. Shareholders have participated in
capital raisings over the same period to
the extent that they were offered con-
vertible notes on a l-for-4 basis in early
1961 this issue roughly amounted to
a share issue at a 100 p.c. premium with
dividends reduced during the first three
years. They have also been offered ordi-
nary shares in late 1962 on a l-for-3
basis at a 60 p.c. premium.
Despite this, a bonus issue in 1957/58
and an increase in the dividend rate in
1958/59 have boosted dividend income
to such an extent that over this eight-
year period it has been increasing at ap-
proximately 8 p.c. compound.
Presumably one could expect this rate
of growth to continue for some time and,
if it does for the next ten years, the
return from dividends alone on the pre-
sent price of 21s. 6d. would be just about
7 p.c. This suggests that the price is
fairly high at the moment.

gesture from the company to com-
memorate the 50th anniversary of public
listing.
The shares are currently 51s. 6d. after
touching 525. 6d. earlier this year. They
show an income yield of 3.9 p.c. and an
earnings yield of 5.8 p.c., which indicates
the market’s esteem for the stock and
disregard of the modest earnings dis-
closed.
It is only in the last four years that
consolidated earnings have been re-
vealed. Although the latest tax provi-
sion of £134,339 is not disproportionate
to profit stated as £241,408, it is felt
that conservatism prevails in the com-
pany's accounting and that its financial
structure is very solid.
However, an earning rate of 12.3 p.c.
covering a 10 p.c. dividend (paid for the
ninth year in succession) gives little
scope for much generosity. It is un-
likely that dividends would even be in-
creased to 1H p.c. (paid on a couple of
occasions in the past) until earnings give
better clearance for such distribution.
In December, 1955, shareholders re-
ceived a three-for-five bonus. As their
pre-bonus dividend was 15 p.c., which
came back to 10 p.c. afterwards, there
was not much improvement in their
income. As far as the company was
concerned, it was probably more a de-
fensive move than anything, increasing
capital to £1,154,223.
Since that date, there have been issues
to acquire W. H. Wassail and Son Pty
(a NSW wholesale paper merchant),
Parsons and Hayes Pty (printers’ engi-
neers), Super Transport Service (NSW)
Pty (a transport and storage business),
W. Nevill and Co. Ltd (NSW manu-
facturing stationer), Olympic Stationery
Ltd (NZ) and a minority holding in
King and Prior Pty (a Sydney paper
merchant).
A one-for-five issue of 20s. shares at
12s. 6d. premium has been the only
capital benefit for shareholders since
1955.
Present paid capital is £1,965,000,
supported by reserves of £1,471,141,
most of which are general reserves of
£950,606. Loan capital is now consider-
able, at £1,802,507, in mortgage loans
and debenture stock.
The basic business is distribution of
newsprint, printing and wrapping papers,
stationery and machinery for the print-
ing and associated trades. Its suppliers
are both Australian and overseas firms.
It has agencies with American, British
and European manufacturers of print-
ing machinery and machines for the die-
casting industry.
All sections of the group's activities
experienced greater demand in the latest
year to April. Competition was keen,
but gross profit rates were much the
same as the year before, so the higher
sales brought higher profits.
An additional £766,300 was borrowed
in debentures during the year to finance
extensions to the NZ factory and altera-
tions at Alexandria. W. Nevill is in
the process of moving to newly reno-
vated premises at Alexandria, which
were bought last year. Costs of the
move, incurred mostly in 1964-65, will
be covered by a provision made some
years ago. Directors said in their 1964
review that, considering the disruption of
the move, sales and profits have been
well maintained. The benefits of con-
centrating operations in one location are
expected to appear in 1965.
Indications of financial strength and
conservatism are the size of properties
valued at cost £990,742, compared with
£382,222 at valuation; the fact that book
value of plant and vehicles at £598,918
is half original cost, after depreciation
and special reserve; investments in listed
securities'£187,347 are worth £274,333
on the market; and there is a provision
for stock depreciation and contingencies
of £308,209 amongst current liabilities.
The eminent respectability of the com-
pany, with its proud record of continu-
ous profits and dividends going back to
at least 1933, makes it suitable for rich
elderly widows, but not particularly
attractive to the ambitious young man.

JOHN A. GILBERT HOLDINGS LTD
Bumper Earning Rates
'C'ebruary 1, 1964, marked the 25th
A anniversary of the association of
John A. Gilbert Holdings Ltd with
General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd.
The financial year to March 31, 1964,
was also important for the construction
of a new £500,000 sales and service
centre in Parramatta Road (Sydney),
which largely accounted for the in-
creased investment in fixed assets, as
shown in the balance sheet, up from
£681,854 to £1,207,134.
The company was located in William
Street for 38 years, but these premises
eventually became outdated for a dealer
in the highly competitive motor industry.
They will, however, still be maintained
as a showroom. The new showroom
has extensive pre-delivery and after-sale
service facilities and office accommoda-
tion. There is provision for extra storeys
later if necessary.
The group keeps its shareholders in-
formed of quarterly profits (after tax
estimates at Bs. in the £) and sales in
value and vehicle units.
In the latest year to March, profits
improved in the second half to allow
the company to register a result of
£215,869, net of £150,705 tax and
£103,028 depreciation. The previous
year’s profit was £191,989 after
£133,873 tax and £59,837 depreciation.
For the last eight years the group has

operated in the field of vehicle leasing,
with greatly increased success during the
past year. This explains the sharp lift
in depreciation provision. A number of
nationally-known concerns now lease
their fleets from the subsidiary, Industrial
Lessors Pty.
John A. Gilbert has new Holden
showrooms and used-car lots in eight
locations. Nasco spare parts are also
handled.
Most importantly, hire - purchase
finance is provided through the subsidi-
ary Credit and Guarantee Pty, which
made little progress in 1963-64 because
of the high degree of liquidity in the
economy and increased competition.
The chairman (Mr W. J. Maddock)
said in his annual review that because
of this activity, it has not been possible
to classify the company as a typical
vehicle distributor. A certain gearing
of borrowed funds to capital is essential
for profitable operation of the finance
subsidiary. Over the last year to March,
deposit borrowings rose from £292,050
to £419,150. Total outstandings were
almost unchanged at £1,352,932; the
provision for maturity was £212,857,
or 18.67 p.c. of net outstandings.
Fixed term borrowings also increased
greatly, from £20,462 in 1963 to
£409,529, which consists of £179,029
loans on mortgage, £68,400 unsecured
loans and deposits, and £162,100 for
future instalments secured under terms
agreements.
The group-owned Bus Lines of Aus-
tralia Pty secured six new buses during
1963-64. This interest has limited
potential, directors say, because of the
rising ratio of motor cars per head.
Another property at 92 Parramatta
Road was also purchased in the year
under review for storage of vehicles and
panel beating and retail parts opera-
tion.
Interest charges on funds borrowed
for building operations, which are only
now commencing to be productive, were
absorbed in 1964 earnings.
Since the public placement for listing
purposes in September, 1954, share-
holders have been asked to subscribe to
a three-for-ten par issue of shares in
1956 and a convertible note issue in the
ratio of one-for-five shares held in 1959.
There are 404,576 ss. 6 p.c. notes,
which convert at par -o ordinary shares
next December 31, bringing paid capital
to £662,188, including £50,000 in parti-
cipating preference shares.
Their conversion will tend to put a
brake on future earning rates. How-
ever, the latest rate of 41.5 p.c. is highly
satisfactory in relation to the steady 15
p.c. dividend.
In pricing the 5s. shares at 17s. to
yield 4.4 p.c., investors are expecting
improvement in the company’s situation.
The company appears wedded to its 15
p.c. dividend rate. Loan funds have
provided the finance for recent expan-
sion.
For the time being, no cash or bonus
issue appears imminent, though either
is possible within two or three years,
provided the Government makes no dis-
criminatory moves against the motor
vehicle industry.

ABEL, LEMON HOLDINGS LTD
A Little Undervalued
of the glamor floats of the year,
Abel, Lemon Holdings Ltd, cer-
tainly fulfilled dividend expectations, but
its profit for the year to March 31 left
investors a trifle disappointed.
The net profit was £61,71.3 after tax
of £46,674 and depreciation of £17,226,
compared with a 1963 profit, adjusted
for public company tax rates, of £69,563
after £45,900 tax, as quoted in the
prospectus.
The chairman pointed out at the
annual meeting that the trading profit
before tax, of £114,052 for 1964 was
only £l4ll more than for 1963. How-
ever, the £114,052 includes a capital
profit of £5665 on the sale of fixed
assets. The 1964 net profit after tax
mentioned in the previous paragraph
relates to true trading profit only.
After writing off £6183 in prelimi-
nary expenses, the profit available for
appropriation amounts to £61,195. The
dividend, a first and final payment of
10 p.c., takes £35,000.
Headquarters are in Sydney, at
Waterloo, but the company plans to
move to new premises in Concord West.
The Waterloo property has been owned
since the early 'thirties.

known to consumers, because it is not
much associated with the retail trade, it
is well known to manufacturers and
wholesalers of chocolate and confection-
ery, foodstuffs, bedding, upholstery, tan-
ning, brushware, drugs, fruit juice and
perfume, textiles and so on.
The subsidiary, Thomas York and Co.
Pty, processes ferrous alloys for the iron
and steel industry. It is worth noting
that group results for 1963-64 include
only nine months’ trading for York.
As the company specialises in import-
ing. indenting and merchandising raw
and semi-raw materials for use by manu-
facturers and other Australian basic in-
dustries, and handles not only imported
but Australian-made goods, it can
readily be appreciated that the business
is very sound and broadly based.
In fact, it has made the proud claim
that throughout its long history, during
depression, recession and wars, it has
always been profitable, and has never
retrenched staff for economic reasons.
When the holding company was
formed, shareholders in the proprietary
company, which had a paid capital of
£125,000, were given 1,000,000 5s.
shares in the new, a virtual one-for-one
bonus. Former shareholders were also
paid £31,250.
The public issue of 400,000 5s. shares
at par provided working capital and this
cash consideration. The paid capital
then became £350,000, which is sup-
ported by reserves of £104,928 at 1964
balance date.
Applicants for the public issue have
had the opportunity of doubling their
money on the Exchange, although the
shares are currently around 9s. 9d.
having come back from a peak of
11s. 3d.
The dividend yield is 5.1 p.c., and
earnings yield 9 p.c. Compare this
with the 4.7 p.c. and 9.1 p.c. respective
yields from Gollin Holdings Ltd, a much
larger merchandising organisation, and
Abel, Lemon shares do not appear
greatly undervalued.

The Whirligig of Investment Taste
Building contractors put themselves under a cloud
Tndustries come and go in investment
popularity. One that has gone is
building contracting. Early in the year
Thiess Bros, the Queensland-based civil
engineer, announced a loss for the first
half of its year. The shares fell to 65.,
but in due course the hopefuls pushed
them back up to Bs. A loss for the year
should not have been a surprise. It was
for the market, though, and the shares
are now down to 4s. 6d.
McDonald Industries has followed a
similar trend. Only a month ago the
shares were Bs. Following the release
of a guarded statement about some dif-
ficulty in Queensland operations, a more
sober assessment of the shares has been
made. They are now down to the 6s.
mark.
The recent history of price move-
ments in Project Development is an
interesting one. . Early in the year,
directors of the company advised share-
holders that a meatworks in Northern
Australia had been purchased from the
managing director, Mr E. M. Clement-
son. This seemed a most peculiar
diversification for a building contractor.
The market also had its suspicions, since
the shares dropped to under 7s.
Along came June 30 and the shares
took off to Bs. 6d. Not very long after,
out comes the recently listed Tangible
Securities’ result, showing a very re-
spectable asset backing. It just so
happens that Tangible Securities is a
major shareholder in Project Develop-
ment. The moral of the story is to buy
Project Development early in June and
sell on the last day of the financial year.
The share department of James Hardie
must be getting fed up with seeing trans-
fers in my name. This share could well
hold the record for the greatest number
of times any stock has been in and out
of the portfolio.
The shares seemed to be building up
strength just prior to the close of the
issue. An amount of 1365. for every
share seems an awful lot to pay, yet
the outstanding record of the company
warrants such a price. Most recent news
has been the cheap purchase of the ill-
fated asbestos pipe joint venture of
Wunderlich and Humes. Whereas Wun-
derlich and Humes were still struggling
with establishment losses, it should be
quite a different proposition under the
direction of Hardies. It also gives James
Hardie a monopoly in Australia in
asbestos pipes.
From asbestos, I moved on to scrap
metal. A. G. Sims has been through
more changes in the last couple of years
than most companies go through in a
lifetime. If we go back to 1960, we
find the company was not only the largest
scrap metal merchant in Australia, but
that it also operated an apparently profit-
able shipping line in Hong Kong with
the romantic name of Hang Fung Ship-
ping & Trading Company Ltd. As much
as to prove that it was a company to
be reckoned with, it purchased the Morts
Dock property at Balmain for £825,000
and a little later a passenger liner, th(
MV Wanganella. To achieve this exj
pansion the capital tripled in the fou>
years to 1961.
Then the Hang Fung Shipping Coni
pany started to have difficulty in show
ing profits. The directors took a closeij
look and found the accountants had not'
worried too much about items like de
preciation. At the same time the business
at home was turning sour.
The upshot of all this was the appoint
ment of a management committee. Very
ably this committee has weeded out the!
avenues of diversification, so that thef
company now concentrates on scrag
metal merchandising again.
With a total loss of almost £500,000
in 1962 and 1963 behind it, trading this'
year has shown an impressive recovery
Profits in the first half totalled £200,0001
and should be at least double that for'
the full year. Not only has non-ferrous
scrap metal come back into substantia
demand, but also scrap steel is bein'
anxiously sought by Japan.
At just over par, a purchase of 200}
did not seem out of order.
Only one sale this week, and that was
the Smith and Miles at 255. The transy
action showed a profit of £7l. Smitit
and Miles is still a sound investment
but this price seems quite high enoug!
for the time being.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Critics and the Wool Scheme
Anti-reservists lack strong leadership
llThat the opponents of the Wool
Board’s proposed reserve price
scheme for wool marketing had in 1951
and what they do not have this time
is a leader.
In 1951, woolgrowers voted over-
whelmingly against continuation of the
Joint Organisation scheme (a reserve
price scheme, if not quite so compre-
hensive as the new plan).
The leader, and an outstanding per-
sonality at that, of the forces marshalled
against reserve price in 1951 was Mr
J. P. Abbott.
He was a former Federal parlia-
mentarian (New England) and he was
a prominent figure in the Opposition
benches during Labor’s term of office.
Abbott was also a former Federal
president of the Graziers’ Association,
coming out of retirement to lead the
fight against reserve price in 1951. He
was a colorful personality and he got
support.
Many smaller woolgrowers and most
of the bigger ones belonging to the
Graziers’ Association settled solidly be-
hind him except in one State.
That was Queensland. The leader of
the Graziers there was a young new-
comer, a brash fellow according to
many, named Bill Gunn.
Now Bill Gunn is Sir William Gunn
and it is his turn.
Strangely, there is much, at the per-
sonal level, which suggests that Gunn
learned a great deal from Abbott.
Like Gunn, Abbott was a big man,
looming large over his contemporaries.
Like Gunn he was possessed of a brand
of audacity and humor which won him
friends and disarmed critics.
T ike Gunn he was inclined to infuriate
his friends, as well as enemies,
by lowering his horns and charging,
letting lesser mortals pick up the pieces.
And like Gunn he sometimes ended up
winning.
It is said that the lucky make their
luck. Both of these wool personalities—
each in a different time seemed to
have luck on their side. The important
thing is that it is now, in 1964, a dif-
ferent time, and it is Gunn’s time.
One tremendously important factor,
which could well ensure the success of
this marketing plan, has been generally
overlooked.
It is this: as well as being Wool Board
and International Wool Secretariat chief,
as well as being on the Meat Board and
the Reserve Bank Board, Sir William
Gunn is also on the executive of the
Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Council (the
Graziers’ Federal organisation).
His plan has the support already of
the smaller growers throughout Aus-
tralia.
He has not got all the Graziers
behind him, but he has a lot (he is on
their executive, remember). And it
would appear that he has at least some
of his confirmed Grazier opponents
thinking along the new line.
The high Grazier faction unimpressed
by Gunn’s marketing ideas is apparently
not strong enough to do anything about
ousting him from Grazier Federal
Executive. He was re-elected to the
executive after he recommended reserve
price marketing to the Australian Wool
Industry Conference in Canberra.
ITThe high Grazier opposition to market-
ing is therefore unlikely to exhibit
itself in direct form. Rather, it will
appear as expressions of doubt as to the
workability of the plan, of the financial
aspects, of the economics of reserve
price selling, and of potential dangers to
come.
The difference here from 1951 is
notable. In 1951 the Graziers had a
champion in J. P. Abbott, leading the
“League for Democracy”. That was the
name he gave his campaign committee
and it illustrates the entirely different
emotional feeling that was aroused in
1951. This time all the campaign com-
mittees, all the emotion, are on the other
side.
Gunn certainly has his ups and downs
with the Federation men (smaller growers
belonging to State bodies which at
Federal level are the Australian Wool
and Meat Producers’ Federation). No
Grazier ever has had this kind of
support, even if it ebbs and flows, as
has Gunn. If unity of the industry is
to come about one day, there are still
a lot of hurdles to be jumped. Yet Gunn
has the industry closer to it than it has
ever been.
If this were 1951, the Federal
Graziers’ president would be already
castigating the reserve price scheme.
Very clearly, it is not. 1951.
Mr T. L. Bull, present president of
the Graziers’, has very properly pointed
out that the plan needs careful considera-
tion on a number of points. So it does.
Mr Bull has not condemned the reserve
proposal. Back in 1951 Mr Abbott was
thoroughly certain.
At that time he had the tacit support
of the British woolbuying interests who
opposed reserve price tooth and nail.
It might be well argued that, at the
time, Mr Abbott did the woolgrowers a
service in leading the fight against Joint
Organisation retention.
Tn 1964 the British opposition is not to
A be detected. If it was it would not
matter nearly so much as it did in 1951.
Japan has now become our biggest
woolbuyer.
British opposition is not showing
through the most likely outlet the
woolbroking firms in Australia which,
with few exceptions, have strong links
with Britain, either through straightout
British shareholdings or obscure affilia-
tions.
Now, most significantly, the “Guar-
dian"’ reports that the Wool Board
proposal has been received “with satis-
faction in British wool and wool textile
trade quarters”. The “Guardian” points
out that if the proposals for the wool
reserve price are finally adopted they will
bring Australian marketing into line
with that in New Zealand and South
Africa.
In 1951, New Zealand and South
Africa were just beginning the continua-
tion of the reserve price method of
wool selling. Apparently the system has
not proved so bad after all.
The “Guardian” said that if Australia
adopted similar selling methods there
would be few complaints from wool-
using people in Britain, who have had
little but praise for the manner in which
the New Zealand scheme, particularly,
has been administered. It was essential,
Yorkshire merchants said, that, once a
pre-determ ined average price for the
clip had been announced, neither price
nor yield should be amended in any way
during the season.
The “Guardian” forecast that, although
Australian growers had yet to agree to
the scheme’s introduction, its accept-
ance was only a matter of time. How-
ever, that remains to be seen.
Yorkshire wool men would watch
developments in Australia in the next
few months with interest. Some of the


men in the raw material section, accus-
tomed to operating their business in a
fluctuating price market, would have to
learn to accept the change.
Firms turning fibre into cloth, on the
other hand, would be better pleased if
the change imparted stability to the
Australian market and limited sudden
price changes. If the scheme did this
both importer and user could well
benefit. Wool would be better equipped
to withstand the competition from the
growing volume of man-made fibres.
So says the “Guardian”.
In 1951 the British Press was not
nearly so kind.
The reasons for this change must
remain largely speculative. The import-
ant thing is that there is a change. It
could be that the British interests
realise that some change is inevitable
and that a reserve price suits them better
than some more drastic method, such as
acquisition.
The Philp Committee report in 1960,
which some opponents of the reserve
plan refer to, was important for
what it did not say. It was a defensive
document supporting the status quo,
which would have been all right except
that there was clearly a very big section
of woolgrowers who were not satisfied
with the status quo.
To be effective, the Philp Committee
report would have needed to be far more
decisive. It was marked by indecision
and the indecision was apparent.
Of far more weight, although it was
only indirectly related to marketing, was
the Portland inquiry in Victoria in 1962.
The woolbroking interests objected to
the establishment of Portland and stated
their case in clear, precise terms. Yet
they lost, and, at the hands of Henry
Bolte’s so-called “businessmen’s friend”
Government, Portland got wool sales.
In the process the brokers’ image in
the public eye suffered a good deal.
Following the Portland inquiry there
was a reshuffle within woolbroking circles
the brokers had been hurt.
It is said that woolbroker attitudes are
now likely to be formulated less at the
Australian Club in Sydney and more in
the conference room, taking into account
such modern inventions as public rela-
tions.
The woolbrokers do deserve some
sympathy. They have to try to please
Peter AND Paul growers who want
to sell high and buyers who want to
buy cheap.
This matter of local sales could have
brought Gunn’s plan unstuck. Local
loyalties, particularly if local money is
invested, carry much weight.
The marketing report clearly states
that, while the establishment of new
selling centres would be considered not
in the best interests of the industry, those
centres already in existence are safe.
Despite these things, of course, there
will still be some opposition to the Wool
Board’s proposal. It is safe to say that
most of it will come from the “high”
section of the NSW Graziers.
For a number of reasons, some which
have little to do with wool or wool
marketing, they have an understandable
suspicion of anything which smacks of
interference or controls. They are the
oldest, the wealthiest, and the most
insular of the woolgrowers of this
country.
They have sometimes suffered at the
hands of their State Governments, par-
ticularly in the matter of land resump-
tions, and their attitude is in some in-
stances justified. What Gunn, and other
advocates of reserve prices who disagree
with him in other matters, will try to
do is to convince this rearguard that
the way to right a wrong is not to con-
tinue the bitterness of the past but to
accept reality and begin a new approach.
The moleskins and the big hat may
give way to the grey flannel suit even
in New South Wales.
Fighting Foot-and-Mouth Disease
New report to the Federal Government
T)R E. A. Eichorn, attached to the
United Nations Food and Agri-
cultural Organisation, has completed his
report to the Federal Government on
foot-and-mouth disease.
We do not have it here, but the risk
of getting it has increased greatly in
recent years. Part of Dr Eichorn’s job
was to advise us on what methods to
adopt should an outbreak occur.
Before he left, he gave a lecture to
veterinarians, farmers and departmental
people in Melbourne. Here are some of
his points.
Foot-and-mouth is caused by an ex-
tremely small virus measuring one hun-
dred thousandth of a millimetre in length.
It is the most infective of all virus.
Animals usually take on a “melan-
choly” expression when first infected and
may be seen leaning against trees. In
dairy cows there is a drop in milk pro-
duction and in severe cases the hooves
may drop off. Losses through abortions
in cows and sheep are high.
If foot-and-mouth (FMD) were to
enter Australia, there would have to be
an immediate halt to exports of meat to
USA a trade worth about £BO million
a year.
Eradication of FMD is expensive. In
the eradication campaign in Mexico
some years ago, the US Government
spent 165 million dollars over a 2\~
year period. The vaccination campaign,
more effective than slaughtering-out,
employed 8000 persons.
Much was achieved in Mexico through
an education and information service.
Children were even given comic books
explaining FMD. Such public relations
technique was a big factor in the success
of the Mexican campaign.
Control measures are twofold. Either
all infected animals are slaughtered-out
or a vaccination programme is instituted
over a period of years. The slaughtering-
out method is a calculated risk. It is
cheap compared with vaccination.
In Australia a unique situation exists.
Due to a large number of wild buffalo,
pigs and cattle in the north the risk is
frightening. The disease could smoulder
in these animals for years. Control would
be extremely difficult. The Army, per-
haps, would have to be called in to
slaughter all animals that could be found.
Not all animals get foot-and-mouth. It
is confined to cloven-footed animals and
this excludes horses. That can some-
times be a useful distinction in cases
where doubt exists in the identification
of foot-and-mouth.
Transmission from country to country
can be purely mechanical. In one case
a German migrant to the UK took a
piece of sausage in his coat pocket with
him. The sausage was infected and be-
cause it was too stale to eat, he threw it
into a pig-pen. Three thousand animals
got the disease in this particular out-
break and had to be slaughtered.
When foot-and-mouth is suspected of
being in the soil the practice is to turn
pigs in on the area. If they remain un-
infected the area is known to be clear.
Fear of transmission on footwear of
international ’plane travellers is largely
non-scientific. Disinfecting footwear
largely gives peace of mind.
Cheese does not carry FMD except
in the case of one type produced in
Europe. This type cannot be imported
to Australia.
Close examination of the baggage and
possessions of migrants arriving by sea
is a worthwhile precaution.
The disease is found in both hot and
cold countries and has travelled as far
east as the island of Bali.
The Australian Government has had
talks with Indonesia about trying to pre-
vent further spread. In the Torres Strait
islands a number of volunteers have been
recruited to act as part-time stock in-
spectors. Two veterinarians are being sent
every year to the US from Australia to
familiarise themselves at first-hand with
the disease.


Another Desert Could Bloom
More hopeful plans for the Victorian Wimmera
By MARIEL LEE
111 who have seen the widely distri-
* buted film “Desert Conquest” know
bw- the AMP, by making good minute
eficiencies of copper and zinc, brought
utility to South Australia’s Ninety Mile
lesert. Scrub land which, prior to the
JffP’s Coonalpyn Downs project in
949, carried perhaps one sheep to ten
tires, by 1959, when all 80,000-acre-
leep and cattle properties were occu-
ied by selected settlers, was carrying
Imost two sheep per acre and forty to
'ty cattle per holding.
Similar settlement projects were pro-
fessing in the Keith-Bordertown and
districts. Instead of fully
tveloping pastures at Tintinara, the
jMP surveyed thirty 1500-acre blocks,
jig-fenced them, logged and ploughed
}me, provided regulation surveyed
jads, and sold them, mainly to local
Upholders, to be developed. The South
Wralian Government, which will even-
tally provide reticulated water, during
jro years’ exhaustive tests sank one hun-
[ed bores in that comparatively water-
-4s area.
One-quarter million acres of dense,
Imost impenetrable scrub in Victoria’s
lig Desert near Kaniva was also being
iadied for thirty new settlers by 1962.
V desert sand, enriched almost beyond
ilief by copper and zinc trace elements
Bd clovers, was by 1959 growing phala-
s tuberosa, lucerne and clover knee-
igh.
No wonder Kaniva businessmen, far-
iers and Government workers were
this former desert, in 1955
only kangaroos and rabbits
ut now carrying up to two sheep per
ire, could, with the two hundred thriv-
<g future farms envisaged there, boost
•cal land values and production by
jousands of pounds. Kaniva, given the
ads, telephone services and educational
Icilities such a project warranted, would
Ec °me a major primary production
intre.
By early 1964, Big Desert farms were
roducing up to 12 bags of wheat and
1 bags of oats per acre, and carrying
tail beef herds and at least one-and-a-
alf sheep to the acre. Moreover, four-
!en years’ progressive clearing both sides
(the State border had caused no appre-
change in the Desert’s 16-17 inch
fer age rainfall. Fertility - producing
and quickly drying-out hillocks
ft. uncleared have prevented soil
msion.
On Telopea Downs, 100,000 acres of
a former 320,000-acre run, 37 farms
showed all stages of AMP procedure:
sparse, hungry scrub rolled, windrowed,
newly burned: ploughland, to be sown
with three pounds subterranean clover,
two-and-a-half pounds lucerne and one
pound phalaris, with 187 pounds super-
phosphate, seven pounds copper and
seven pounds zinc per acre. One block
sown in 1961 had, in January, 1964,
heavy foot-high pasture growth.
Naturally, Nhill Chamber of Com-
merce and other district bodies want the
AMP to undertake similar development
of 100,000 acres of the nearby Little
Desert, which, with slightly higher rain-
fall and more vegetation, promises even
greater productivity. The Victorian
Government, however, is deferring action
pending fuller investigation of possible
effects of mass land clearing there.
It would, the district generally thinks,
be a national setback if the AMP, so
successful elsewhere, were further delay-
ed in developing the potentially produc-
tive Little Desert, so conveniently near
railways and business centres.
Delay, however, was advised when,
recently, the National Parks Association
met in Nhill for weekend discussion and
inspection of Kiata Lowan sanctuary and
the nearby proposed seven-square-mile
national park, a project not affected by
the AMP development. Professor For-
ster, Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture
at Melbourne University, warned that
continued applications of trace elements
to maintain fertility in such deep sand
might, in the long run, prove uneco-
nomic.
New Superphosphate Works
Co-operative effort in Victoria
A £2 million superphosphate works,
to manufacture 200,000 tons of
super a year, is to be built at Euroa
(Victoria) by a farmers’ co-operative.
Shares and debentures totalling £1 mil-
lion will be raised from farmers and
£1 million will be borrowed from other
sources.
The State Government will guarantee
the interest and principal of loans to the
company.
Share capital will be limited to be-
tween 10 and 100 £5 shares to any one
farmer.
Shareholders will get a rebate on a
ton of super purchased for each share
held.
At present Victoria produces more
than one million tons of super a year
—from three existing manufacturers.
Reflecting the high usage of super in
New Zealand, the mimber of works in
that country will soon total 14. In Aus-
tralia there are 22 manufacturing works,
but only one (other than the Euroa pro-
ject) is a co-operative. In New Zealand
there are three co-operative works.
The Euroa works is not likely to want
for orders. Super was in very short sup-
ply this year as a result, mainly, of the
Federal bounty (£3 a ton). Some farmers
used super at a rate never before con-
templated. Others got none because
there was none left.
Some crops of wheat did go in with-
out adequate super, though the general
feeling is that this has now been cor-
rected. Supplies have caught up to some
extent.
In NSW prices are to rise. In Victoria
they are to stay the same.
It is not likely, however, that the Vic-
torian manufacturers decided to keep to
the old prices because of any fear of the
Euroa works cornering the market. That
venture will still have to pay its way.
The raw material apart from small
amounts from South Africa and else-
where is supplied by British Phosphate
Commissioners and, as everyone knows,
the supplies in the islands are due to run
out.
With the search for fresh supplies of
the phosphate rock there are bound to
be revisions of the price for some time.
An alternative fertiliser may yet be
the answer.
