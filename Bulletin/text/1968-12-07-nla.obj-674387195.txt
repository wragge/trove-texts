So? Sony. That's all. Sony—the name
to look for. To ask for. To insist on
every time it comes to anything as
important as, say, a tape recorder.
After all, Sony created Japan’s first all-
transistor radio. First tape recorder.
First transistorised TV, and home video
recorder. Sony is one of the most
looked-up-to names in the whole mir-
acle-filled world of electronic research.
The point of this ad? Just this. If any
brand name sounds like .Sony, and it
isn’t spelt S-o-n-y, you're not getting
the best there is. Fair enough? So—say
after me: “Sony . . . Sony ~ . Sony . . .”

VENTURING DEEP
INTO SYDNEY
SAFARI COUNTRY
POSTERS FOR THE lion farm at
Warragamba Dam read “Adventure for
spine-tingling thrills . . . yet, absolutely
safe.” Frankly, for an innocent lad
up from Melbourne, easily the most
spine-tingling sensation is the terrify-
ing 40-mile drive out of Sydney along
the Hume Highway. Even the demili-
tarised zone in Vietnam is safer.
But here, after passing through
Wallacia, there is the impression of
being deep into safari country. A
petrol station sounds the warning of
what it would be like to be stranded
out in the middle of the lion farm
with a dry tank and announces, “Your
last chance here.” Then one comes to
the high fence which goes all round
the farm, 12ft. high, plus another 3ft.
at an angle. One of the signs here
reads “Trespassers will be eaten.”
At the office there was Geoffrey
Gibbon, chairman and managing
director of African Lion Safari Pty.
Ltd. Mr. Gibbon was smooth and
polished and reminded one of Steed
out of “The Avengers.” Also, there
was the head game warden, Roger
Murray. He was in khaki shirt, khaki
trousers with jack boots, and was
absolutely Stewart Granger on safari.
Mr. Gibbon made it clear that
Warragamba was just a part of their
world-wide activities. They had lion
farms in England, U.S.A., Holland,
and Germany. Why, lion farms were
so popular there was now a world-wide
lion shortage. “We have a permanent
order in America for 200 lions. The
landed cost for a lion in Australia is
around $lOOO each.”
The original lion safari began in
"Oh, dear! Is it another of those long-
haired demonstrators?”

England with James Chipperfield and
his son Richard at the home of the
Marquis of Longleat, Henry Frederick
Thynne, the sixth Marquis of Bath, the
10th Viscount Weymouth. Mr. Gibbon
agreed that, along with the lions, Lord
Bath had excellent breeding. There
were posters all around the walls
inviting one to visit the other lion
farms. The poster for the lions of Long-
leat referred to “the with-it stately
home.”
“We would really like to have a
kangaroo farm over there. But it is
very interesting. Here you are allowed
to mow down kangaroos with guns,
slaughter them for dog food, ship them
overseas in tins, but anyone who wants
to send them overseas for a farm, so
that they can be seen alive in a farm,
has no hope.”
Meanwhile, Mr. Gibbon said, happily,
the lion farm here had been a big
success. It opened on August 10 and
there were 12,000 cars every Sunday
for three weeks. The queue went right
back to Wallacia. Altogether over
200,000 had been through.
It was time to go on tour through
the park. Roger Murray drove a Toyota
four-wheel drive and Mr. Gibbon had —
one could only admire his perspicacity
a Hillman Hunter station wagon.
The farm was spread over 100 acres
and there were 51 lions. By 1970 they
expected, by careful breeding, to have
more than 70.
Mr. Gibbon said the lions, to stop
them from killing each other, had to
be divided into three sections. The
mature male lion had huge sexual
appetites and tended to mate about
every quarter of an hour.
The price over the gate said $1 a
head for adults. Every few yards there
were warnings “Don’t leave your car.”
“Keep your windows wound up.” “In
case of breakdown, sound your horn
and a radio car will come to your
aid.”
The system is that you drive into
a long cage, then the gate at the other
end is not opened until the first is
closed. Exactly the same system as
used for getting into Pentridge Jail.
As we drove along the road there
were lions all over the place, dozing.
“The lion is a very lazy animal. This
is exactly what they do in their own
habitat,” said Geoffrey Gibbon. And
he explained that tractors went around
urging them to keep close to the roads
where they could be seen.
They looked terribly docile. One
even wondered whether Mr. Gibbon and
Mr. Murray should not form an
organisation to be called “overweight
lions anonymous.” The lions, he said,
had 101 b.. of meat a day each, five
days a week, and this was a non-eating
day.
He drove over to a tree where a
large lioness was sleeping. “That’s
Wilma. You want to keep away from
the others, but she’s very affectionate.
Loves to be tickled. She puts her head
right through the window. One time

you’re sitting. Hey, Wilma. WILMA,
come on. Good girl.”
I was rather grateful that Wilma just
yawned, looked like a wife who had
been disturbed at 7 a.m. on a Sunday,
and went back to sleep.
He went into another section full of
young lions and, seeing that it was,
theoretically, a meatless day Mr. Gib-
bon and Mr. Murray had a little
demonstration organised. The two cars
parked alongside each other and then
Roger Murray began throwing chunks
of steak on to the bonnet and roof
of our poor little Hillman Hunter.
Suddenly, there was a series of
appalling clunks, like a rubbish tin
being crushed. We had two 4001 b. lions
sitting on the bonnet and another on
the roof. The bonnet was now sagging
like an old armchair. One of the lions
licked insects off the windscreen.
It is an unusual experience looking
at a lion face to face, about 4in. apart.
One is immediately struck with the
size of their great, pale almond eyes.
Eyes which aren’t all that friendly.
“Watch,” said Mr. Gibbon. He
turned on the windscreen wipers. At
first the poor creature was frightened.
Then he became interested and put up
a great paw the size of a mallee root.
The lions clomped over our Hillman
Hunter for some time. Then a big fellow
jumped on to the roof of the Toyota.
This was a surprise for Roger Murray,
because the Toyota had a fibreglass
roof, and for a moment there was a
terrible thought that he might have the
lion in his lap. So he had to sit there,
both hands supporting the roof until
the lion departed.
Yet, so far there have been no unfor-
tunate incidents. The score is even. The
lions have not eaten any humans and
the humans have not eaten any lions.
According to Mr. Gibbon, the local
people have been very co-operative and
have raised no difficulties. However,
in Sydney, every conceivable possibility
has been raised. What would happen
in flood or storm. What would happen
if a crashing aeroplane knocked down
a fence?
Actually, with that frightening thought
in mind, it was time to leave. On the
way out it was possible to gather some
permanent mementoes of the visit, a
lion in plastic for 40 cents, a lion in
wood for $1.20, and even a lion tie-
pin for $l.

refrigerated
auto air-conditi
the cold air pours in
20% faster!
Do we have to sell you on the advantages of
refrigerated auto air-conditioning? That’s
easy. Think of your car. 30 sq ft of hot glass,
200 sq ft of hot steel, hot engine., hot exhaust
inches away from steam mg hot t Turner ...
and you in the middle of it ait
Now think of your car almost immediately as
cool, as pleasant as any air-conditioned
office or restaurant. No matter how shim-
mery-hot the road, how stickily-hot the tem-
perature. You drive better, safer. You work
better, more efficiently. No sticking to seats.
No damp, crumpled clothes. No finger-burn-
ing steering wheel. Noise, heat, dust, humid-
ity are kept outside. AND Smiths refrigerated
auto air-conditioning units keep it that way.
Why Smiths? Even easier to answer. Smiths
units are designed and made in Australia for
Australian conditions. Tested and proved
over millions of Australian driving miles.
(What may be fine on some 200 mile U.S.
freeway can’t be expected to adapt to our
multi-surface roads and clogged city traffic!)
Performance? Well, obviously, getting your
car cool quickly is the most important factor
in auto air-conditioning. And it’s here that
Smiths are a mile ahead—with 20% faster
cooling. Two reasons. One: the refrigerated
air pours in faster—with Smiths new heavy-
duty blower assembly and side vents to make
sure you get faster cooling of those hard-to-
cool pockets around your feet. Two: Smiths
units dissipate the hot air much faster—
with bigger, exclusive condensers.
So —Hot air out faster. Cold air in faster.
20% faster. Only with Smiths.
Any more new features in the Smiths ’69
units? Certainly. The entire Smiths system—
evaporator, condenser and compressor—has
considerably greater power than any other
unit. A bigger evaporator coil of unique
design provides for an equally marked
increase of the cooling capacity inside the
car. Smiths units are light, compact and can
be installed or removed any time (unlike
non-transferable unitsthat are built-in before
the car’s final assembly). Note, too, the posi-
tion of the controls. Designed for Australian
vehicles, they are on the driver's side for
extra convenience and safety. And Smiths
refrigerated auto air-conditioning is quiet...
matching the cool relaxation it brings you.
The styling is exceptional—complementing
the appearance of any dash.
So why drive a hot box? It’s so easy to have
a Smiths refrigerated auto air-conditioner
installed. Write or phone any Smiths office.
We will mail you an informative brochure.
We’ll also send you the name of your nearest
dealer who’ll be glad to demonstrate for you
how Smiths 3 1969 refrigerated air-condition-
ing delivers 20% faster cooling.
And Smiths, world renowned for auto acces-
sories and other components (K.L.G. spark
plugs, Smiths instruments, clocks and
watches, for example), have the only truly
nation-wide network of branches, dealers
and qualified after-sales service agents.
From only $375 including tax (plus fitting).

in the quiet, respectable area of

ing of a see-through plastic bra that
is rather revoltingly called a Peekini.
There is a marvellous turnout, and
Ocean Street is filled wuth cars labelled
Television, Channel this and that, and
Press, and photographers weighed down

first time in months, it gives the Laun-

too modern for Melbourne. He’s been
photographed and interviewed, so has
the husband of Edith, one of the models,
who is introduced as Professor Freeman
of the University of New South Wales.
“Well, I’m not. I’m Reader of
chemistry, and very well paid it is,
too.” Actually, Mr. Freeman isn’t too
keen on being there at all. He should
be at the university marking examina-
tion papers. Now a strangled voice
through the loudspeaker suggests every-
one be seated.
Mr. Freeman is saying what on earth
is Leslie Walford doing here, he thought
his job was to decorate people’s interiors,
not exteriors, and Leslie is saying, well,
no, he writes this column and gets so
many invitations he can’t accept them
all, adding, en passant x as Pierre Mann
sits down, that he has a marvellous see-
through love-seat for four in his garden
at Palm Beach, which he blows up with
his Hoover, and he was wondering
whether a tie-up might be a good idea?
Mr. Freeman listens. Fascinated.
Puzzled. Popping in to see Edith’s shows
is something he does to give him a lift
from the strain of university life and — ;
ah, here is Edith wearing the Peekini
the way Mr. Doube would like to see
all women wearing it: with a waist
sarong and nothing else. “Lukewarm
Barbarella,” murmurs Mr. Freeman.
Then out come Sandra, Antoinette, and
Linda wearing it the way it’s gonna be

plain when you put on models in swim-
suits and barefoot. ‘Why aren’t they in
shoes?’ they say, ‘it’s disgusting.’ ” But
Julie’s thrilled about the whole thing.
It is, after all, fashion, and it’s marvel-
lous everyone’s so interested like this.

They cover the nipple. Actually he is
rather more interested in political
accounts than fashion. He’s working on
the unfortunate Australian tendency to
shoplift at the moment, if you can call
that politics. We lead the world in it.
And Leslie’s going on about his see-

one should stick a pin in it, or cigarette.
After all, we’ve lived for years with Li-
Los. And Mr. Freeman’s rocking on his
swing seat, mesmerised by it all . . .
Before lunch there’s a bit more
photography. The waitress in the lava-
tory is saying the Peekini won’t go near
her, she doesn’t think it makes her look
beautiful. Antoinette and Linda are
asked for their views. ’S all right.

ment was old ladies’ clothes, is cavorting
round the Chiswick Restaurant gardens
with a ginger photographer. Actually,
she’s a bit fed up. For one thing, that

A STITCH IN TIME
SAVES
TWO IN THE BUSH
FOR ANYONE WHO cares about the
purity of our cliches, there are some
disturbing tendencies today. One of
them is the growing ignorance of tradi-
tional sayings among young people.
This was illustrated by an incident on
the television show “It’s Academic.”
A quiz contest was being held between
teams of bright senior pupils from
secondary schools, and contestants had
to complete some common phrases.
The questioner said: “The man was
very sick. In fact, he had one foot in
the ”? A boy hesitated and then
replied: “Bed.”
The fault seems to lie partly in the
schools and partly in the home. When
I went to school we had to write sen-
tences like “A stitch in time saves nine”
in our copybooks, so that we acquired
an early respect for the trite. This was
reinforced by the conversation of our
elders. Even the least gifted of us
would never have committed such a
solecism as saying that a chronic invalid
had one foot in the bed.
I encounter frequent examples of
this misuse of standard expressions. A
schoolgirl of my acquaintance said some-
one was “as thin as a whistle.” A novice
writer claimed in a newspaper article
that he had looked carefully at his
subject and intended to punch his
points home. This is not good enough. If

he took a long, hard look and meant
to pull no punches, he should say so.
Youth and inexperience may excuse
the mishandling or disregard of cliches
in some cases. But the practice is more
serious when it spreads to seasoned
politicians and business leaders. One
noticed this when a Cabinet Minister
was asked an awkward question. Instead
of giving the correct answer: “My
Department has the matter under con-
tinuous review,” he replied: “I’m afraid
my boys don’t know anything about it.”
Perhaps the most disquieting signs
of the trend are to be found in com-
pany reports. There was a blatant
example recently in the speech made
at the annual meeting of Mammoth
Diversified Industries by the Chairman,
Mr. Frank N. Blunt.
He said to the shareholders: “I have
to report that results of the company’s
operations were lower than last year,
because of the poor performance in all
divisions. Profits for the opening months
of the current year are not at all com-
parable with those of the previous
corresponding period.
“However, I see little reason to
believe that there will be any improve-
ment in the year ahead. General
economic conditions are not buoyant,
and our company has repeatedly shown
its inability to keep pace with the
development of the country as a whole.
“The results for the past year have
been achieved only by the careless
administration and defatigable work of
the management. I must say at this
point that I yield to everyone in my
admiration for our Managing Director,
Mr. Leslie Fumbell. But his tiring
efforts would have availed more if he
had not been so ill-served by our dis-
loyal and incompetent staff.
“During the year our Chief Technical
Manager made an extensive tour to
study current trends in overseas centres
of entertainment. I feel sure that as a
result of his experiences the company
will continue to lag behind the latest
developments abroad.
“In keeping with past practice, the
same optimistic policy has been followed
in valuing the stock-in-trade, book
debts, and other assets, and share-
holders cannot have any confidence in
the figures as they appear in the balance
sheet.
“It is proper for me to refer here
to the takeover bid for the company
by the Universal Acquisitive Corpora-
tion of Chicago. Universal Acquisitive
has made a generous offer of $2 for
every share held by directors and their
families and $1 for every other share.
Your directors strongly recommend that
you accept these terms.”
Shareholders listened to the speech
with growing irritation. The climax
came when Mr. Blunt said: “I have no
faith in the future of Australia.” Amid
stormy scenes he was voted off the
board and rightly. Things will reach
a pretty pass, and many eyebrows will
be raised, if those in the corridors of
power cease to look forward with
confidence to this country’s unlimited
opportunities.


the Indiavidualists
The peoples of India are as colourful and as varied as
India herself. Each is different. Each has his or her own
individual kind of charm.
But they all have one thing in common: their enthu-
siasm for the progress of India today.
You see this enthusiasm wherever you travel in India.
In the crisp service of the bearers at any of the spark-
ling new hotels. In the students at the universities. In
technicians who man sophisticated new laboratories.
You see its results in brand new cities like Chandigarh.
And in the modern road, rail and air services that bear
you to see the romantic, contrasting sights of old India
... the abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri, the temples
of South India, the immortal Taj Mahal.

HOW GAPPY IS YOUR GENERATION?
Comment by ‘Observer'
SOME PARENTS now worry as much
about the generation gap as they worry
about their front teeth. Yet a survey
carried out at Columbia University,
suggests that American parents may be
exaggerating the differences between
themselves and their children. If this
is true, it would seem likely that in a
more traditional society like Australia
the gap is even less.
It is true that the survey found some
significant differences between parents
and children, particularly in personal
habits and religious belief. American
students are more likely to smoke
marijuana or to engage in pre-marital
sexual activity than their parents were,
and, as between one generation and
the other, the number of religious
doubters has doubled and the number
of the very religious has halved. But
in many other changes in attitude, both
parents and children have changed at
the same time, with the only differences
those of tempo and sharpness.
Overall, only about one tenth of the
American students interviewed showed
drastic changes from their parents with
another third showing moderate change.
But most of those who showed a drastic
alienation from their parents and from
society generally seemed to do so be-
cause of family tensions or adolescent
rebellions that had pretty well settled
the issue before they went to university.
It would seem quite likely that a
ten percent figure of a personal revolt
against parents would be par for any
period in history.
The majority group of students who
were in political revolt were the chil-
dren of old lefties. They were not in
revolt against their parents; they were
conservatively carrying out their
parents’ protests. In doing this they
were simply expressing the general prin-
ciple that most young people were
found to follow the political leanings
of the households they came from.
There was not, however, any general
carryover into personal habits from
political beliefs. Pot-smoking was now
carried on as much by political conser-
vatives as by political liberals. What
most determined personal habits was
parental strictness. If parents were
strict, the restraints they enforced were
almost always maintained. Since only
about one-fifth of the students had been
brought up strictly, it seems fair to
assume that one of the main reasons
for parents’ disappointment in their
children is that the children have taken
advantage of whatever freedom their
parents allowed them.
What seemed particularly significant
about the survey was that it suggested
that student discontent was not caused
mainly by the inadequacies of the uni-
versities but that it came mostly from
. .
the results of pre-university adolescent
revolt, with some help from those older
people who wanted to use the campuses
as battlegrounds against the Govern-
ment’s policies on the draft and on the
Vietnam War.
Along with these, the question of
career-choosinsr seemed to be one of
caieer cnoosing seemea to De one oi
the principal factors in tension. Even
switches from parents’ politics seemed
to be associated with switches in ideas
of jobs. Those who preferred govern-
ment or university employment tended
to be Democrats and those who pre-
ferred business, Republicans irre-
spective of their parents’ politics and
beliefs. But, beyond this, much of the
tension that existed seemed to come
from the fact that the huge expansion
in education in America has outstripped
even America’s huge expansion in
economic growth. Even in America
t h er e weren’t enough good jobs to go
round
Tr . . .....
If there is anything in this survey,
it suggests not only that parents worry
too much about their children, or not
enough, but that universities, when ran-
sacked by student revolt, may worry
too much about themselves. Whatever
inadequacies there are in the universi-
ties should, of course, be considered—
but they should be considered in them-
selves. Since it may not be the nature
of universities that makes students
revolt it seems possible that if the uni-
versities panic and try to restructure
themselves to suit the yells of the
rebels they may simply muck themselves
up.
There are two ways in which the
whole framework of tertiary education
might be reconsidered, and these are
that it should be more carefully
restructured to take into account the
twin purposes of providing, at whatever
level suits different kinds of people, an
intelligent interest in the civilisation of
which they are a part, and an intelli-
gent interest in the kinds of jobs they
are likely to get. If the institutions of
tertiary education worried more about
these two purposes and less about their
rebels, they might later move into such
a position of strength that those who
rebelled against them could simply be
told to buzz off.
GOVERNMENT BY LIMITED NEGOTIATION
Comment by Alan Reid
THE RESIGNATION of Dr. P. H.
Frankel, the Government’s oil expert,
is embarrassing enough. Dr. Frankel
resigned because the Government
decided its oil policy without waiting
for his advice. If Ministers and Com-
monwealth Public Servants resigned for
similar reasons, the exodus from both
the Cabinet Room and Public Service
would be large scale.
The change in administrative styles
made by Prime Minister John Gorton
over the past 12 months is undoubtedly
resented by a very powerful, influential,
and significant section of the Public
Service. While Ministers are undoubt-
edly uneasy about the changes,
they have not reached the stage of
being resentful.
There may be reasons why their
attitudes are muted. Mr. Gorton’s
unpredictability is, in an odd way, one
of his strengths, even the most powerful
Ministers cannot be sure that if they
voice a protest the Prime Minister will
not tell them “If that’s the way you
feel, pick up your hat and depart
there are others waiting to take your
place.”
The Public Servants also could be
overstating the reasons for their dis-
content. There could be a personal
element in it. The top echelon of the
Public Service is like a family. They
are prepared to squabble fiercely among
themselves, but when the vested interests
of the group are in question they close
ranks.
They do not like the way in which
Sir John Bunting, former trusted
adviser to both Sir Robert Menzies and
the late Harold Holt, was shouldered
aside to make room for Mr. C. L.
(“Len”) Hewitt as Secretary of the
Prime Minister’s Department. They do-
not like the way in which Hewitt
appears to be gathering around him a
group of officers who worked with him
in his former Public Service posts.
They do not like the fact that
Hewitt does not work out of the Prime
Minister’s Department, as Bunting used
to do, but from an office adjacent to
that of the Prime Minister in Parlia-
ment House, as though to emphasise
that he is the sole channel of com-
munication through which the Public
Service can have contact with the
Prime Minister. They are angry over
what they claim to be the growing prac-
tice of officers of the Prime Minister’s
Department contacting junior officers in
their Departments to secure informa-
tion upon which are based proposals
which are kept from the Ministers and
their departmental heads until the last
possible moment.
But, whatever the legitimacy of their
complaints, there is no doubt that under
Mr. Gorton, government has become
bilateral rather than multilateral.
Departments are undoubtedly being

ignored. Government is by negotiation,
between Mr. Gorton and another Minis-
ter, rather than through a network of
Departments with the final result
endorsed by a Cabinet consensus. This
is a novel form of government for
Australia.
Just to take a few simple illustrations:
The Government last week announced
its intention of entering the overseas
trade with two chartered British-built
vessels. The deal was a most compli-
cated one, involving association with
British container ship consortia. Under
normal circumstances it would involve
both the Treasury and the Department
for Shipping and Transport within
their functions lies responsibility for the
control of the Australia National Ship-
ping Line, whose efficiency has now
been demonstrated across a number
of years of testing operation. The deal,
basically, was arranged on a bilateral
basis, between Mr. Gorton and Mr.
McEwen, and announced by London
newspapers as firm on the day
that Ministers were presented with the
Cabinet submission and were still try-
ing to disentangle the details, and 24
hours before Cabinet was called upon
to rubber-stamp it.
Similarly, the oil agreement between
the Government and Esso-BHP seems
to have been worked out largely
between Mr. Gorton and the Minister
for National Development, David Fair-
bairn, with the Government not only
not having the advice of its oil expert
but, according to Dr. Frankel, refusing
to wait for it.
Similarly on external affairs state-
ments, there are reports that the Exter-
nal Affairs Department have been
called in for their views only after the
Prime Minister, presumably acting on
Mr. Hewitt’s sole advice, had already
formulated his views.
Then there was the decision about
preventing the overseas takeover of
the MLC. This was done while Mr.
Gorton was travelling away from Can-
berra, with Hewitt his sole accompany-
ing adviser. While the Treasury might
have agreed with what was done, there
is reason to believe that they did not
agree with the way it was done, because
of the effects it might have upon capital
inflow which Australia so urgently needs.
The instances can be extended almost
indefinitely. Everything is “top secret,”
often even from other Ministers. Minis-
ters are told that they must not even
inform their Departments and secure
the departmental view.
The feeling is undoubtedly disturb-
ing Ministers who worry about good
government. The Minister for External
Affairs, Paul Hasluck, recently
described the public servant as “a
custodian of a continuing national
experience, or in other words a man
whose view has the value to be taken
into account.”
The Government may learn some-
thing from Frankel’s resignation. It
needs to. Otherwise the Public Service
suggestion that the Government is turn-
ing into an “instant coffee” administra-
tion could be justified by events.


One more week
DECISION
AUSTRALIA’S first nuclear power
station will go to Sydney; this is now
considered definite. New South Wales
has won out over Victoria because of
that State’s oil and natural gas sup-
plies. Canberra now is waiting for a
final submission from the New South
Wales Electricity Commission before
an announcement is made.
SETTLING IN
THE FIRST GROUP of Turkish
migrants arrived here on October 15.
One month later a letter appeared in
an Ankara newspaper from a Turkish
migrant complaining that job quali-
fications were not being recognised here
and that they cannot eat the food
supplied at the hostels. This suggests
the Turks are learning the drill for
migrants to Australia much faster
than average.
ALL WET
ARRESTED by the publicity paragraph
which said that the Australian city in
which the ABC has set its television
series “I Married A Bachelor” had
been struck by a “typhoon,” we tuned
in to the next episode. All the charac-
ters were talking about a “typhoon”
which had struck sections of the city,
leaving others untouched, not at all
the way a typhoon behaves.
It’s hard to take seriously a program
which purports to present a section of
Australian life when no one connected
with it seems to know that it’s called
a cyclone, or perhaps a tornado, here
and a typhoon only in Chinese waters.
Chinese? Perhaps the DLP might take
it as further evidence of Communist
influence in the ABC.
CASUAL COMMUTERS
THE CASUALNESS with which some
Australians, notably businessmen, com-
mute between the capital cities is apt
to disconcert their more immobile
fellow citizens. One woman, recently
appointed as executive head of a
national organisation, announced that
she would live in one city and work
in another; the note was almost
‘‘Doesn’t everybody?” And last week
we heard of a company sales manager
who visited five cities in four days to
make his appearance at the firm's
round of Christmas parties.
But in spite of Australians’ willing-
ness to take to the air, matters are not
made easier for them. There is the well-
known and roundly criticised system of
Ansett and TAA running parallel
flights. The airlines are fond of boast-
ing that Australians on a per capita
basis use aircraft more than people in
any other country, only 20 percent fly,
but those who do fly often. But the air-
lines still claim that we don’t have a
large enough population to warrant the
convenience of the air-taxi service, such
as operates between Los Angeles and
San Francisco, where a plane waits on
the tarmac until it is full, then, when
it takes off, another moves forward in
its place.
On this point it is worth noting that
the combined population of Los Angeles
and San Francisco is about 3,300,000
compared with about 4,700,0T50 for
Sydney and Melbourne. There are at
present 52 flights a day between Syd-
ney and Melbourne, which sounds
enough to argue for an air-taxi service.
One of TAA’s star passengers is a
wrestling promoter who spends every
week this way: on Wednesday he’s in
Sydney, he flies to Brisbane on Wed-
nesday night, back to Sydney on Thurs-
day, where he works all Friday, then he
flies to Melbourne on Saturday,
Adelaide on Sunday, Perth on Monday,
back to Melbourne on Monday night,
then returns to Sydney on Tuesday.
The Ford Motor Company estimates
that it has an average of ten executives
flying between Sydney and Melbourne
per day. They belong to all depart-
ments manufacturing, sales, market-
ing, public relations, export, planning,
and distribution and they go either
to conferences or to see individual
clients. But there’s no routine about
each man’s flying record <■ — he may
make three trips in one week and none
the next.
From time to time, the company also
has a number of men temporarily
commuting between home and family
in one city and job in another, an
arrangement which has been known to
last for as long as 12 months.
Both airlines say the busiest travel-
lers are the easiest to please, although
some tend to become a little blase about
food, perhaps passing up the roast
chicken for a sandwich. Otherwise, their
main concern is speed, and in the air
they get it (average flying time between
Sydney and Melbourne is now one
hour), but the ground arrangements
associated with flying are not quite as
streamlined.
Time spent travelling to and from
airports and checking luggage usually
takes longer than the actual flight.
Unlike European airlines, which have
WHO RULES BRITANNICA?
A LETTER from writer Patrick
White to “The Sydney Morning
Herald” after the announcement of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica awards,
deploring the choice made for the
literary section, seems likely to become
an annual affair, rather like the letter
the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney used
to write each year condemning the
opening of the Royal Easter Show on
Good Friday.
Last year, when it became known
unofficially but, it seems, correctly that
the board which makes the awards had
turned down the recommendation of
the literature committee that the award
be given to novelist Christina Stead
Mr. White wrote a letter of protest.
The refusal. was on the grounds that
Miss Stead no longer lives in Australia.
Last week Mr. White wrote a letter
pointing out that last year Miss Stead
was denied the award because she was
Patrick White .. .annual event
“not an Australian.” “Yet, in 1968,” the
letter adds, “the poet Douglas Stewart
is eligible for the same dubious
charity.” (Mr. Stewart was born in
New Zealand; by what was undoubtedly
a slip of the pen Mr. White failed to
make this ground for objection clear
to the many readers of the “Herald.”)
Last year Mr. White felt that the
passing over of Miss Stead helped
explain to him why, for some time past,
he has “felt a foreigner in this pathetic-
ally chauvinistic parish.” This year he
was reduced to asking the editor of the
“Herald” if he can explain why “our
intellectual affairs are reduced to this
pitiful state.”
We are entirely convinced of the
worthiness of Miss Stead and Mr.
Stewart to receive the Britannica
Award; we are equally convinced that
the Britannica people, when they
decide to give away relatively large
sums of money, can decide the con-
ditions that will apply.
However, it seems that Mr. White
might just as well save his pen to write
another novel. It is unlikely that Aus-
tralians living outside the country are
likely to get the awards for a very
simple reason. This year the advisory
committees have been eliminated and
some members of them taken on to
the board which actually makes the
decisions. However, the view on
eligibility, which was originally put
forward strongly by the science com-
mittee, seems likely to prevail. (The
Britannica people have only one vote
in nine on the board.) If expatriate
scientists were eligible it might become
a very rare thing indeed for an Aus-
tralian working in this field in his own
country to get the award.


computerised equipment for handling
baggage, Australian airlines are handi-
capped by poor facilities, and although
both airlines operate helicopter services
between Essendon and Melbourne, they
haven’t been able to do the same in
Sydney.
But for those who can accustom
themselves to inconveniences of that
kind commuting by air does have com-
pensations. “For one thing, I get a
lot more reading done on the plane,”
says one commuter who spends four
days a week in Sydney, three in Mel-
bourne,. “because people leave you
alone. There’s none of this chummy
business between passengers that there
was when I first started flying at the
end of the war, and everybody seemed
to think they were setting out on a joint
adventure.
“It’s like a bus. I leave home at six
in the morning, and I’m in my office by
8.45.”
FREE SPEECH
THE MAGNA CARTA is more a
symbolic and legendary document than
a true charter of human rights, but it
can still raise strong emotions. Some
of the strongest have been raised in
Federal Parliament since Australia’s
700-year-old copy of the document was
removed from Kings Hall, Parliament
House, to the National Library.
An overwhelming majority of MPs
signed a petition demanding its return.
The matter died down but last week
flared again with a private member’s
motion by West Australian Liberal
Senator Reg Withers, that the right
place for the Magna Carta was in the
library. “There is something peculiar,
almost sick in a society which is pre-
pared to almost worship a mere physical
thing which is of relatively no import-
ance,” he said. It was what the Magna
Carta said, not where it was, that was
important.
At the time the question was raised,
the Senate, with only one more day to
sit, still had 20 Bills on the business
paper with more expected from the,
House. Former Opposition-Leader Don
Willesee tried to bring the matter back
into perspective, saying that in the
Senate the “heat and length of a
debate is always in inverse proportion
to its importance.” The two great issues
of the session were the siting of a
new Parliament and the siting of the
Magna Carta. One would not think
there was a war raging in Vietnam,
starving Biafrans, or a great monetary
crisis which could affect Australia.” The
petition demanding return of the Magna
Carta was not worth while, though he
believed a prima facie case existed for
keeping the Magna Carta in Kings
Hall.
The final vote, on a free basis, split
Party loyalties in both the DLP and
Government. Six Liberals and DLP
Senator Condon Byrne voted for the
National Library. The rerftainjng 40
Senators in the House went for Kings
Hall.
MATTER OF INTEREST
SENATOR IAN WOOD (Lib. Q.)
last week joined with the DLP and
Labor opposition to defeat in the Senate
legislation proposing a levy on aircraft
passengers. Though Senator Wood has
over the years often voted against the
Government, his vote this time sur-
prised his colleagues.
Senator Wood is a travel agent in
Northern Queensland. The North
Queensland phone book for 1968 car-
ries big advertisements on pages 79
and 107 stating that the Ian Wood
Travel Service at Mackay does bookings
for TAA and Ansett airways.
Paragraph 196 in the House of Repre-
sentatives standing orders states: “No
member shall be entitled to vote in any
division upon a question (not being
a matter of public policy) in which he
has a direct pecuniary interest not held
in common with the rest of the sub-
jects of the Crown.”
The Senate has no comparable stand-
ing order.
“The Australian Senate Practice,”
written by Mr. J. Odgers, Clerk of the
Senate, states: “There is no standing
order in the Senate under which a
Senator can challenge a vote on the
ground of pecuniary interest. It is
unlikely that questions of pecuniary
interest will arise in the Senate because
such questions would more probably
arise in relation to private Bill legisla-
tion dealing with special interests. No
private Bill has ever been introduced
in the Senate.”
LADIES' DAY
THE ELIZABETHAN TRUST build-
ing in East Sydney stands on the brink
of a large hole. At regular intervals,
loud explosions shake the windows and
make the hole larger in the cause of the
Eastern Suburbs Railway.
The Trust is also on another kind of
brink, with its future uncertain. But
for the moment the show goes on,
directed by a new ringmaster, the secre-
tary co-ordinator, Stephen Hall, with a
few more drumbeats than, before.
In the cause of showmanship and
public relations, the Trust rather sud-
denly, after 14 years of operation, held
its first Open Day this week. It hopes
to bare its all (at the moment summed
up by the “Tintookies” and preparations
for “Opera ’69”) to members of the
public in the future, but the try out was
held for the benefit of a less demanding
audience—the Trust Ladies’ Committee,
whose activities have been helping to
raise funds for the Trust over the years.
As Trust members have been ready to
admit in the past, 153 Dowling Street
is no Wonderland, but the ladies didn’t
seem to mind. They were eager to be
impressed, and they were. The antique
lift simply added a touch of adventure
to the proceedings, and they managed
to summon, up almost as much interest
in the electrics department as in the-
properties—although not quite.
In the wig room, they laughed at
a collection of moustaches stuck like
forlorn moths’ wings on sheets of
brown -paper, admired lengths of silk
sent by the Japanese Government for
kimonos in next year’s production of
“Madame Butterfly,” and marvelled at
Boris Goudonov’s coronation robe set
up for the occasion as the wardrobe
department’s piece de resistance.
The staff rose to the occasion.
Designer Desmond Digby, looking only
slightly abashed by the feminine in-
vasion, explained the painstaking
business of producing a set design
from an initial model of quarter-inch
scale, while the head of the jewellery
and costume-painting department told
the ladies how much she enjoyed her
job (“I look forward to getting here-
each day”).
The property manager felt the same
(“It’s not like a factory. You do some-
thing different every day”) and the
music librarian put in a word about
equipment the library still needed.
For good measure, the Trust had
even thrown in a short color film of
the Aboriginal Theatre, not that the
Aboriginal Theatre had actually been
here for a while, but the Trust’s
choreographers were notating the
dances, you see.
It all ended with a peep at the
comic opera “School for Fathers” in
rehearsal, afternoon tea, and surprises
all round — silk scarves hand-blocked
on the premises with designs from Trust
productions. The ladies, we can safely
say, loved the whole show. It will now
be interesting to see how long the sea-
son runs.

American management and Ameri-
can enterprise may be the best in the
world, but they do not necessarily trans-
plant satisfactorily; the French in the
18th century and the British in the 19th

made historical errors of judgment in
that belief with fatal consequences.

Bushfires-avoidable disasters?
“Shocked realisation that it could
happen here” when bush fires menaced
new homes on Sydney’s elegant North
Shore last week
FROM THEIR EMINENCE of
around 3000 ft., suburbs of Sydney’s
northern perimeter have had a safe
view in other years of bushfires, mainly
in the Blue Mountains, which rear up
steeply from dense growth far to the
west.
Apart from a flare-up or two in
wooded valleys on the fringes of today’s
residential areas, where orchards and
pig farms flourished only about 15
years ago and land values have since
soared, residents of the northern
suburbs had had no real first-hand
experience of the fear fire can, instil.
Until last week when the bushfires
came to Wahroonga and St. Ives and
the other newer fashionable districts
which merge with them.
On Thursday, in high temperatures
and strong winds, the bush in and
around the Kuringai Shire reserves
and nature areas, parched by months
of unprecedented dryness and edging
right up to elegant houses in neat
lawns, blew up with frightening
ferocity. By night the sky was a red
haze, firefighters’ sirens shattered the
customary stillness, flying ash settled
over miles of tree-lined avenues and
the North Shore was shocked into the
realisation that it could happen here.
Even in the Blue Mountains, where
fire is an annual visitation, nothing that
had happened before could forewarn
residents and firefighters of what nature
had in store last week. From the
mountain town of Katoomba down to
Penrith on the lower slopes, fires on
a 30-mile front roared through settle-
ment after settlement, leaving disaster.
The heat exploded houses even
before the fires reached them. Shocked,
dazed homeowners were led away in
hundreds as they saw their houses
engulfed, cars moving on highways
were overtaken.
A respite from fighting the fires
on Black Thursday and all the night
through came with a drop in tempera-
ture early on Friday but, while the
damage and loss of life was still being
worked out there came the threat of
new outbreaks in the towns of Linden
and Woodford. More than 1000 service-
men were rushed there, reinforced by
300 RAAF personnel from Penrith and
Regents Park air bases.
The mountain fires claimed four
victims, one a 69-year-old pensioner
who was incinerated in his house, the
other a motorist who perished in
flames which engulfed his car. The
other two were firefighters who col-
lapsed while fighting a blaze at Spring-
wood. A fifth victim was a man who
died while trying to assist volunteers
at a bushfire in. Terrey Hills, north of
Sydney. Early reckoning put the num-
ber of injured at 200, with 600 men,
women, and children homeless, 126
homes gone, and total material damage
at $2 million.
Bushfires are, of course, not isolated
incidents in Australia. Victoria’s ordeal
came in 1939, again in 1944, and
several more times up to 1965. New
South Wales flamed up last in 1957.
Tasmania was 1967 and Western
Australia just before that again. If
you count outbreaks which do not quite
reach catastrophic proportions, Austra-
lia on the average faces a major fire
problem every other year.
This year’s New South Wales out-
break was anticipated as early as last
autumn. Government and fire
authority spokesmen drew attention to
the build-up in vegetation after good
years of rain, They said that all the
State needed was a drought to set the
stage for serious fires. The drought
came, as inevitably did the fires.
The background of cost, catastrophe,
and tragedy is in the past. It will con-
tinue into the future. It must be recog-
nised and planned for. There are four
areas which warrant attention.
The first is avoidance. Statistically
most fires are caused by man and the
two most serious classifications are
either a result of burning off or are
started deliberately. The other, cover-
ing such items as agricultural opera-
tions, camp fires, cigarettes, and sparks
from transport, are equally controllable.
The need is for education, stricter
penalties, and rigid enforcement.
Next comes lessening of the fire
hazard. A program of controlled burn-
ing to reduce the amoun,t of fuel
available for “wild” bushfires offers the
most exciting development here. But
on the individual level, there is need
to fireproof homes and reduce hazard
around them.
Third is firefighting organisation.
Recognising the inevitability of fires,
they should be hit hard and early before
they blow up. We have to assign res-
ponsibility for firefighting, and provide
a cadre organisation which will train
and provide firefighters and their
equipment, build tracks, water storages,
and lookouts, design and provide
equipment like water-tankers and fire-
fighting machinery, and set up the com-
munications network required. These
people will also need a scientific and
technological back-up. We need to test
new devices and techniques and carry
out basic studies of fire. With a national
problem of this dimension, there is a
clear need for a liberal research and
development budget.
Only one State in Australia is well
advanced along all these paths ■—
Victoria, With a fortunate combination
of fairly liberal State finance, a com-
paratively small area to handle, and
spurred by three catastrophes in most
voters’ memories, the Victorians have
established a first-class organisation,


The Sydney “Daily Telegraph” and

technical back-up, have launched their
own R. and D. program and are
closely linked with the Commonwealth
one. They have also started on a
hazard-reduction program, established
on scientific principles.
Tasmania and Western Australia
are also advanced along all these tracks,
although organisationally they lack
Victoria’s resources. New South Wales,
organisationally, is a shambles, although
the sheer initiative and hard work of its
firefighters were the elements this year
that prevented one of the greatest
tragedies Australia has ever seen.
In New South Wales, bushfire fight-
ing is the responsibility of several
bodies. The Board of Fire Commis-
sioners has to do it in metropolitan
and provincial town and city areas.
Elsewhere, the shires form local
volunteer brigades to handle the areas
under their control. The Forestry De-
partment handles State forests and
other designated areas. Between all
these there is a vast no-man’s land
unoccupied Crown Lands, which are
really nobody’s responsibility. These
are where the fires breed.
A State Bushfire Committee co-
ordinates all these activities. The com-
mittee is responsible to the Chief
Secretary, who has the power to declare
bans on lighting fires in the open when
fire conditions reach critical levels. The
committee also administers a Bushfire
Fighting Fund, totalling about $1.2
million a year, which is contributed
by the State and Local Government
organisations on a basis of 25 percent
each, with insurance companies supply-
ing the rest. An extra $200,000 a year
is also made available by the Govern-
ment for works, such as fire trails,
water storages, and hazard reduction.
On top of this, the Forestry Depart-
ment pays for its own protection and
the Board of Fire Commissioners
absorbs its responsibilities within its
overall fire-protection budget.
When a fire starts, it is first handled
by the local responsible group. In the
case of a shire, for instance, the volun-
teer brigade is turned out and starts
work. If the fire gets too big, there
is provision for the local authority to
declare a state of emergency and
other forces from neighboring brigades,
police, and Government sources are
called in. Operations are controlled by
a Fire Chief, designated from a list
of approved persons. As the emergency
grows, the full network of the State
organisation comes in, including, im-
portantly, the police radio network,
which provides the key communica-
tions.
The system has several major faults.
First, unoccupied Crown Lands are no
one’s responsibility. In N.S.W., these
total about 30 million acres. For the
most part they are the rugged moun-
tain and bush areas where fires can
lurk for months, waiting for the right
combination of heat, low humidity,
and wind to create a “blow-up” and
roar down on agricultural land and
homes. Next, there’s a built-in period
of indecision at a critical time. The
calling-in of outside assistance does not
happen automatically. This means it is
hard to hit a fire quickly with over-
whelming force. Finally, the N.S.W.
situation lacks a “command” echelon
at critical stages. It is not until the
catastrophe is an alarming fact that
an overall commander takes over the
battle, handling the disposition of
forces and technical back-up.
It is still too early to make a definite
assessment of the Blue Mountain fires of
last week, but the facts of the South
Coast-Wollongong burn of October 28
are becoming available. The Blue
Mountains disaster is likely to follow
the same pattern.
Although Press reports suggested,
and local people believed, there was one
huge fire, in actual fact there were a
number, in, three or four main groups.
Many of these fires had been going
since mid-August. They began in the
country on the western side of the Great
Divide, mainly as comparatively small
escapes from burning-off by farmers and
householders well back from the crest.
The situation was critically dangerous
for weeks. The good years had thick-
ened the vegetation, of “fuel” as the
experts call it. When the blow-up con-
ditions arrived, the westerly winds raced
the fires at express speeds to the crest of
the range.
The process happened in two waves,,
with a lull between, and in this lull
organisational shortcomings prevented
proper control. One major fire, for
instance, was being handled at its face
(the downwind front where it is most
active), at its rear, and on one side.
Each group believed it had control, but
there was n,o command echelon to see
the problem as a whole. A westerly
change arrived, the fire broke out, and
only a combination of bravery, hard
work, and sheer luck prevented a
Hobart-type disaster.
“I dread these words in a newspaper
report: ‘The fire is being watched and
is under control,’ ” one bushfire research
worker told The Bulletin. “It’s no more
under control than it is flying over the
moon. There’s just no one there to
bring it under control.
“The Blue Mountains and Hawkes-
bury sandstone-type country is un-
doubtedly the worst firefighting terri-
tory in the world. You can’t put men
within five miles of some of these fires.
When they put out a statement like this,


The huge fire races on down the Blue Mountains
More devastation
lies behind it (r.)
While others pre-
pare to meet it in
their turn
the authorities are wishfully thinking
that the fire will stay back in the moun-
tains. And most years it does, but in a
year like this it, unfortunately, doesn’t.
It comes out on the plain, and endangers
lives and rural property.
“Firefighters just weren’t in the race
handling the situation in New South
Wales more than two months ago. All
they can do now is try to save houses
and property where they can. In these
conditions, I wouldn’t tell men to go in
and fight a fire in the hinterland. It’s
far more dangerous even than the Los
Angeles area. Anywhere you run into
cliff country you have a hopeless job.
You can’t get machines in an.d it’s just
too dangerous for men. There’s
nowhere to run to. If you have your
back up against a cliff and there’s a
fire coming toward you, you have
nowhere to go. It’s just too bad, and
it’s the end.”
Victoria, too, has its areas of dan-
gerous fire risk. The Gippsland fires
of 1939 and 1965 were among Aus-
tralia’s worst. Then the Peninsula area
around Port Phillip Bay, where in the
height of the fire season scores of
thousands of holidaymakers are “neck-
deep in dry grass and camped in
among the teatree” (as a Victorian
expert described it), poses a major
threat to life.
But although it took several disasters
to drive all the facts home, the prag-
matic Victorian Government has
finally acted and has created what is
undoubtedly the best bushfire organisa-
tion anywhere in Australia and pos-
sibly in the world.
There are two clear areas of respon-
sibility:
• The Forestry Department with its
corps of fully trained employees as
paid firefighters is responsible for
State Forests and vacant Crown Land,
or a total of something like 15 million
of the State’s 84 million acres. The
Forestry people also have a legal res-
ponsibility for what they call “the mar-
ginal mile” a mile of country
around both forests and Crown Land
so they are required to fight fire over
30 percent of the area of the State.
• The Country Fire Authority handles
all fires outside the metropolitan area
(including towns and cities) with a
small cadre of professionals and
110,000 volunteers.
The liaison between the two groups
is close, with no hint of rivalry. The
N.S.W. situation where no one is res-
ponsible for vacant Crown Land just
doesn’t apply. In fact, when the one-
mile margin of occupied land is taken
into account, the two authorities are
both responsible for fires. These prob-
lems are worked out in the regional
areas between responsible officers.
The big difference between the two
States is that the joint Victorian policy
is to hit fires hard and early. Profes-
sional and volunteer officers are trained
in this philosophy and in command
procedure. They know that if they
can’t bring a fire under control within
minutes, the massive State-wide back-
up that has been created is already
moving into action to support them.
And from the moment a fire is
started, there is someone who is res-
ponsible for watching its course and
for seeing the fire as a whole and
making decisions in this context.
The Victorian organisation is new,
but it also claims it is tested. O.n the
basis of past experience, severe fires
were predicted last year following the
State’s long and hard drought. Several
fires did occur, but generally they were
held in check, property and forest
damage was contained, and no lives
were lost.
The Country Fire Authority is
housed in a building in. East Malvern,
Melbourne, and the influence of its
forceful chairman is apparent the
moment you set foot there. Mr. R. T.
Eason (formerly Brigadier Eason) was
appointed permanent chairman of the
authority in 1965, its first. He immedi-
ately brought to the job a para-military
organisation structure as well as a
direct pipeline to the Victorian Gov-
ernment.
The chairman runs the organisation
through a structure of professional
staff headed by the Chief Fire Officer
and his deputy. These in turn adminis-
ter six zones, who control between
them 25 regions. Professional officers
direct each region and administer
groups of several brigades. The com-
parison is obvious. There is a clear
affinity with the corps, divisions,
brigade, battalion, and companies
command chain of the army. And in
the CFA it extends down to the
equivalent of infantry sections, which
are the basic firefighters on the ground.
The budget is around $2.5 million a
year, two-thirds contributed by insur-
ance companies. The authority has the
power to go as high as $4 million.
Throughout the organisation morale
is high. The authority clearly defines
every member’s responsibility and his
obligations. It sees that he gets good
equipment and, probably most impor-
tant, it provides extensive training at all
levels, with the emphasis on initiative
and making decisions. “We will always
back them up on a decision,” Mr.
Eason said. “Some of the decisions will
not be the best that could be made, but
in this business it is better to make a
decision quickly an.d carry it out rather
than dither and make none at all.”
The heart of the CFA building is a
magnificent operations room, big
enough to run the Vietnam War and
almost well-enough equipped. Radios
and direct telephone lines are to hand.
Dispositions of men and equipment are
plotted. Availability of technical back-
up like aircraft and Red Cross units
are noted.
The Chief Fire Officer at the apex
of this complex has within reach the


control communications to handle a fire
of any dimensions anywhere in the
State.
“When a fire starts, we expect the
local men to bring it under control or
fight it to the point of exhaustion,” Mr.
Eason said. “By then we will be ready
to relieve them with a thousand men
and hundreds of vehicles if necessary.
All the help we need will be there or
on the way. Food, clothing, sanitary-
facilities—all of it is called out within
minutes.”
The contrast between Victorian readi-
ness and N.S.W. faltering clearly shows
the need for a cadre of well-organised
professional firefighters to meet Aus-
tralia’s bushfire threat. It is not an easy
thing to accomplish and it does cost
money. But the benefits are propor-
tional and satisfying.
This, in fact, was the main finding
of the Commission which inquired into
Tasmania’s fire disaster. As a starter, it
has recommended a pei'manent and pro-
fessional chairman, for the firefighting
body. It is hard to see how N.S.W. can
do less. But it would be hard to seri-
ously entertain any system which would
replace the amateur volunteers. A
national professional firefighting corps,
under Australian conditions, would be
of little value. By the time they were
deployed, they would be too late (and
the speed of Australian fires is much
worse than anything in North America,
for instance). They would also lack
local knowledge. Other instant panaceas
like water-bombing and smoke-jumping
would n.ot be a success in Australian
conditions except in very special circum-
stances. At our present stage of popula-
tion, we do not need other sophisticated
devices such as infra-red detectors for
fire alarms either.
The formula for averting disaster in
Australian conditions is well known,
tried, and part of the Australian tem-
perament. We cannot altogether avoid
fire. But when it comes, we have the
national genius for raising competent,
strongly motivated groups of volunteers
to fight.
LABOR
EYEBALL TO EYEBALL
A GROUP OF Federal Labor parlia-
mentarians persuaded the N.S.W. ALP
Executive last week to move for the
disciplining of Mr. Clyde Cameron for
attacks upon N.S.W. ALP president
Mr. C. T. Oliver. The parliamentarians
got the N.S.W. executive to report Mr.
Cameron to the ALP Federal Executive
at its next meeting.
As a result the ALP Federal Execu-
tive is in for as nasty a struggle as it
has had since the Harradine affair.
In a 26-minute outburst last week that
effectively shattered the facade of sur-
face unity Labor has been trying to
build up during the present parliamen-
tary session, Mr. Cameron:
(1) Contemptuously defied the
authority of the Opposition Leader, Mr.
Whitlam.
(2) Continued with an attack on
Mr. Oliver in his capacity of N.S.W.
secretary of the Australian Workers’
Union for allegedly publishing in an
AWU journal “damaging, libellous, and
untrue statements,” about men nomin-
ating for union office.
(3) Clashed with Mr. Cope . (Lab.
N.S.W.) who asked “What has this to
do with Parliament?” and “Why can’t
you bring this up in the Party room?”
Delighted Government supporters
watched as Mr. Cameron, a member
of the Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party, fought attempts in the House of
Representatives by Mr. Whitlam to
silence him on this subject. When Mr.
Stewart (Lab., N.S.W.) intervened and
said “Break it up, Clyde,” Mr. Cam-
eron snarled “I’m going to finish it.”
Mr. Stewart then said, in a perfectly
audible voice, “You’re nervous, Clyde.
Your hands are trembling, Clyde. What
are you doing now, Clyde?”
Mr. Stewart kept up his comments
until the Acting Speaker, Mr. Lucock,
Above: Clyde Cameron (Labor, S.A.)
Below: F. E. Stewart (Labor, N.S.W.)
intervened and suggested that Mr.
Stewart should cease interjecting. After
Mr. Cameron ceased speaking, Par-
liament saw an extraordinary tableau
staged, Mr. Stewart dragged a chair
alongside Mr. Cameron and glared into
his face, almost eyeball to eyeball.
When Mr. Cameron broke away to
watch Mr. Cope, who was then speak-
ing, Mr. Stewart moved his chair
between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Cope,
and continued glaring, face almost
touching, at Mr. Cameron.
When the debate finished, Mr.
Stewart blasted Mr. Cameron solidly
for two minutes in the House of Repre-
sentatives in a voice he did not attempt
to mute. Labor men who were listening
said that if Mr. Stewart left a Labor
epithet unused, it was because he had
not thought of it.
Much of the Labor resentment against
Mr. Cameron is due to the fact that
the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party
took steps in 1965 to make peace with
the Australian Workers’ Union and its
officials, estranged because of earlier
attacks on the AWU by Mr. Cameron.
On the present issue, Labor is dividing
not on ideological grounds but is shat-
tering into groups.
Former Labor Leader Mr. Calwell,
who has no reason to love either the
AWU or its officials but who has never
attacked them publicly, told colleagues
that he regarded Mr. Cameron’s attack
on Mr. Oliver as “unprincipled when
made under privilege.”
The Labor parliamentarians who
pressed N.S.W. to report Mr. Cameron
to the Federal Executive were told that
the Victorian ALP was unlikely to sup-
port Mr. Cameron on this issue. The
Victorian attitude could make the situa-
tion on the ALP Federal Executive very
interesting. N.S.W. would need to get
only nine of the 17 votes on Federal
Executive to get Cameron censured.
GOVERNMENT
BY PERSONAL DECISION
THE GOVERNMENT’S entry into
overseas shipping, announced last week,
was very much the personal decision of
Trade Minister McEwen and Prime
Minister Gorton. Vital aspects of the
arrangement were opposed by the Aus-
tralian National Line, an Interdepart-
mental Committee on Shipping, and the
Government Parliamentarians’ Wool
Committee. The arrangement was-
finalised before having been considered
by Cabinet.
All the parties tendering advice to
the Government said that it would be
wrong for it to go into pure container
vessels, as being run by ACT (Associ-
ated Container Transportation), the
company the Government has now gone
in with. The Interdepartmental Com-
mittee said that on their estimates there
was likely to be excess tonnage, and
they concluded that the pure container
system was too inflexible to be profit-
able. They recommended that the
Government buy into “Scandia-type”
ships, which can take unitised loads as
well as containers. What will decide
the profitability of the whole container
shipping enterprise is going to be the
economics of containerising wool. If the
wool sellers find they can get cheaper
rates elsewhere, the container ships will
have almost no cargo on return runs.
The Australian National Line sup-
ported the Interdepartmental Commit-
tee in its opposition to the pure con-
tainer system. This attitude is on the
public record in the form of an ANL
brochure on the “unitised” system it is-


using on the Australia-Japan run in
its partnership with the Japanese “K-
-line.” In that publication, the Austra-
lian National Line described its unitised
system as being “a minimal-cost system
of loading, stowing, and transporting
Australian wool.” Under a subheading
“Advantages over cellular containers”
is the statement:
“We believe the system to be more
economical in the use and cost of
ancillary shore facilities and equipment
than other methods, and therefore we
anticipate it will lead to substantial
savings for Australian and Japanese
wool interests, by comparison particu-
larly with the cellular container ship
in this trade.” In this ANL publication
the chairman of the ANL is pictured
beside huge piles of wool bales banded
together into “unitised” loads ready to
be lifted into a ship.
The Government Wool Committee,
in a report to the Government in Sep-
tember, endorsed the view of wool
brokers that the unitised system in
Scandia ships was far superior to con-
tainerisation.
Another ground for doubt about the
profitability of the partnership which
the Government has bought into centres
on the fact that the rival consortium
is far ahead in its plans to introduce its
ships. By March next year it will have
them all in operation. The ACT group
in which the Government is working
will not have its first ship available
before April at the earliest, according
to Mr. McEwen.
The Minister for Trade, at a Press
conference held last week in the Prime
Minister’s office, seemed to go out of
his way to avoid implication of his
officials in the deal. He stressed that
the estimates of profitability were not
Australian Government estimates:
“They are predicted on the calculations
of these great shipping companies who
have themselves, out of their experience
over 150 years in the trade, made their
calculations.” He claimed it had been
calculated that the operation would be
profitable from the second year on-
ward, but added two reservations. The
first was that “We haven’t gone into
this to make a profit, we have gone in
to be inside the show.” His second
caveat was the implication that the
financial calculations had been based on
the wool-sellers preferring container
ships to unitised Scandia ships, a
proposition which the experts doubt.
The Government move into over-
seas shipping originated from a sug-
gestion by the British businessman, Lord
Vestey, owner of the Blue Star Line and
a partner in ACT. It is reported, and
neither the Prime Minister nor the
Minister for Trade denied it when it
was put to them, that Lord Vestey made
strong efforts to involve the Australian
Government in the partnership. By
late August, Mr. McEwen had a pro-
posal that the Government should invest
$3O million to $4O million in equity in
another of ACT’s subsidiaries, the Port
Line.
A sketchy version of this plan was
presented to Cabinet on August 27 and
agreement in principle was gained. Mr.
McEwen, on his extended overseas trip,
took time off to pursue the matter in
London. With the ANL, the Inter-
Departmental Committee and wool
people so firmly against the scheme, it
was reduced to a smaller $7 million
charter deal.
On his return, Mr. McEwen bypassed
the Cabinet, putting his completely re-
vised plans simply to Mr. Gorton and
Mr. Hewitt, his secretary. “The Times”
shipping correspondent, Michael Bailey,
reported from London on the 24th of
November that the Australian Govern-
ment had finalised its charter deal. This
was the first many members of Cabinet
knew about it, because no submission
was distributed until the 25th. A 60-
page document was distributed without
them having time to properly study it,
and Mr. Gorton said there was no time
for a full discussion because he was
making an announcement in Parliament
that afternoon. Mr. McEwen and he had
presented their colleagues with a fait
accompli.
VICTORIA
WHOSE CONTEMPT?
“THIS IS THE most scandalous
episode that has occurred in the history
of the Parliament,” said the Leader of
the Victorian Opposition, Mr. Clyde
Holding. They were strong words,
yet events in the Victorian Parliament
seemed to have indicated that scandal,
like beauty, resides in the eye of the
beholder.
The scandal, or non-scandal, rose
over claims by some politicians that
the Parliament’s honor had twice been
injured, once by the head of the Vic-
torian Public Service Board, Mr. Frank
Cahill, and once by the Premier, Sir
Henry Bolte.
If Parliament’s honor was damaged
by the fracas, so was Liberal Party good
fellowship. The issue began when Mr.
Taylor, Liberal chairman of the All-
Party Public Accounts Committee, who
was continuing his Committee’s investi-
gations into the Victorian Department
of Public Works, called for a report of
a firm of management consultants
which was in the hands of Mr. Cahill.
The consultants had begun their
report a month before at the time when
Mr. Taylor’s Committee made findings
about the Department and accused it
of having confused procedures, in-
accuracies in its work, low morale, poor
liaison with client departments, and an
inadequate and wasteful system of ten-
dering. Following the Victorian prac-
tice, the Minister for Public Works
didn’t resign, denying responsibility for
the day-to-day workings of his Depart-
ment and claiming that improvements
had long been “in train.”
To Mr. Taylor’s annoyance, Cahill,
who is responsible to the Premier and
who may not be legally responsible to
Parliament, withheld the consultant’s
report for a short time. Taylor inter-
rupted parliamentary business to make
a complaint and give notice that he
would move in the following week that
a pruna facie case of contempt of
Parliament had been committed.
Caught between backbenchers angry
that a contempt may have occurred and
an indignant public service, the Govern-
ment delayed Taylor’s motion and came
up with a compromise motion, which,
perhaps due to an oversight, seemed
to excuse Cahill while still charging
him with contempt. As the usual par-
liamentary practice of referring con-
tempt cases to a special Parliamentary
Committee was ignored, the Labor
Opposition and the Country Party saw
their opportunity and waded in.
Believing that its inexplicit com-
promise motion would smooth the whole
matter over as a misunderstanding be-
tween two men, the Liberal Party found
itself rejecting an Opposition motion
to have any finding of contempt ex-
punged from the record. The Country
Party and the Opposition were thus.
given the high ground of saying that
as both the rights of Parliament and
Mr. Cahill’s reputation were at stake,
then prima facie contempt could not be
Bolte ... no golden touch
dismissed lightly in favor of other busi-
ness as the Government wished to do.
Perhaps sensing a storm from a public
service not satisfied that Mr. Cahill had
been absolved, the Premier then called
a special Press conference to say that
Cahill had, in effect, not been found
in contempt. Again, the Government
had exposed a soft belly. Mr. Holding
soon after raised a question of privilege
claiming that Sir Henry had denied a
specific ruling of the Parliament.
Another long debate followed, with
the Government speakers conscious of
the awkwardness of their contempt one-
minute-not-the-next position. The
privilege motion against the Premier
was then squashed by the Government’s
overwhelming majority, and Sir Henry
was once again free to use the parlia-
mentary bar.
He would need a drink. Labor and

for the Hols-
worthy “shoot-
ing gallery”
the Country Party had scored some
points. If, in the intricate manoeuvres,
the Liberal Party was not split from
top to toe as their opponents claimed,
its Leader, the master political dab,
was shown to have lost some of his
golden touch. His Cabinet’s unusual
practices were once more called into
question and his own future discussed.
Rumors began that the issue had
almost caused a spill for the Leadership,
but since Sir Arthur Rylah’s retirement
is widely anticipated, some men. are
still strongly loyal to Sir Henry. The
one who gets Sir Arthur’s position of
Deputy Leader would be in a good
barrier position for the next event.
NEW SOUTH WALES
SCRAP WITH CANBERRA
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S
occupation of land in and around
Sydney, including 2300 acres of some
of the best Harborside sites and head-
lands, is an old State versus Federal
Government issue and an irritant to
Sydney citizens from North Head or
Neutral Bay to Kirribilli or Woolwich.
The land issue came to a head last
week on a more serious dispute between
the right of the New South Wales
Government to plan the future
development of the State’s biggest city
and the Federal Government’s right to
plan the national defences. The Depart-
ment of Lands, Bridge Street, head-
quarters in older disreputable days of
some of Sydney’s Wild Men and land
racketeers, became the latest fortress—
under reforming Lands Minister Tom
Lewis—of the anti-Canberra States
Righters in Sydney. Pitted against
them, however, was the Australian
Army.
The basis of the dispute is Hols-
worthy, south of Sydney. There the
Commonwealth has a 80-square-mile
Army area, of which about 30,000
acres are N.S.W. State land held by
the Commonwealth on permissive
occupancy (a very frail form of
tenure). The N.S.W. Government wants
7000 acres of this land back for 20,000
home sites for industrial developments.
It claims the land is essential to
Sydney’s future development. The
land falls between the Army’s resi-
dential area and its artillery range.
The N.S.W. Government claims its plan
is sound and in any case as a sovereign
Government had made its decision.
The Federal Government claims the
plan is not sound (too many un-
exploded shells for safe home building)
and in any case the Army needs the
land.
Under the law, however, the Com-
monwealth can resume any non-
recreational land in any State, under
its Land Acquisition Act. To meet this
threat, Minister Lewis proclaimed the
disputed 7000 acres as recreational
land. The Federal Government counter
ploy was to amend its Acquisition Act
last week to allow it to resume recrea-
tional land. (The legislation, in fact,
did n,ot resume the land but only gave
it the right to do so.) Lewis’ next step
was to issue the Commonwealth with a
notice to quit. Now the Commonwealth
must either quit (which is most un-
likely) or resume the land and pay a
fair price for it and face the
unpleasant publicity for its disruption
of Sydney’s development plans and for
increasing the price of housing land.
The N.S.W. Government’s indigna-
tion that the Federal Government’s
insistence on what some Sydney
politicians call a shooting gallery
should prevail over the needs of Sydney
is qualified by one factor only. It does
not want to be pushed into adopting
an anti-Army posture. It claims it is
as pro-Army, pro-defence, pro-Vietnam
as anyone and it has offered the Army
thousands of acres near Singleton and
Greta Army Camps. But the Federal
Government says that a transfer from
Holsworthy would cost too much.
Lands Minister Lewis (same family
as the late Essington Lewis) enjoys a
scrap with Canberra. In 1967, when
the Federal Government refused to
maintain the Alpine Way built by the
Snowy Mountains Authority, he put
signs up at Dead Horse Gap and Geehi
.saving: “Warning, this road built by
the Federal Government is no longer
maintained. Beware of rock and tree
falls.” In the end he won that fight
and the Federal Government paid up.
But it is unlikely that he will win this
one. N.S.W., however, will at least
get about $lO million for its land a
useful sum in a financially tight year.
THE WEST
MECKERING DICKERING
IN MUCH the same pattern as the
recriminations that followed payments
for victims of the Tasmanian bushfires,
there is bitter criticism in the West
Australian town of Meckering which
was demolished by the October 17
earthquake. With about $400,000 col-
lected, the policy for payments has been
established. As with the Tasmanian
fires, there was horror at the extent of
the tragedy, generosity from the public
in compassion for the victims, appeals
for Federal assistance, built-up hopes
among the people of the town . . . and
the anti-climax of the actual payments.
The Lord Mayor’s Distress Relief
Fund, inaugurated by Perth Lord Mayor
Tom Wardle only a few hours after
the town was flattened, has decided to
pay $3OOO for every house demolished,
irrespective of insurance. For every
Army hut given to relieve hardship tem-
porarily, $5OO will be deducted. Mr.
J. P. Reynolds, a Meckering farmer,
summed up> the general attitude when
he said: “We think the relief money
should be divided among those who
really need it. Some people are getting
quite reasonable payments back from
insurance. These people should not get
money from the relief fund.”
The $3OOO blanket payment is “a
rather peculiar way of approaching it,”
said the shire clerk, Mr. A. S. Andrew.
“For instance, a farmer with assets of
$250,000 will not suffer the same hard-
ship as a $45-a-week wage-earner who
has lost all his possessions. Yet, both
will get the same payment.” The Army
huts, offered as temporary relief, would
not have been accepted had it been
known they would have trimmed the
pay-out by $5OO, according to a number
of farmers.
One of the claimants, Mr. Norman
Richardson, put in for $130,000 for
Caversham, a magnificent old stone
home covering 90 squares, the area’s
showplace. The house was insured for
$25,000 but not against earthquakes.
With the other houses on his property,
the maximum Mr. Richardson will
receive under the relief fund scheme is
$9OOO.
Neither is the plan for re-siting the
town away from the present low-lying
area acceptable to all the townspeople.
The move was decided at a ratepayers’
meeting calling for a shift to a 45-
acre townsite three quarters of a mile
away. Some plan to stay where they
are, in homes they can renovate and
make livable. For the others, the move
will entail all the tedium of a town-
planning scheme being approved at a
time which, for others, is the holiday
season. Aware of the tension building
up, Premier David Brand wrote last
week to Prime Minister Gorton, seeking
further immediate financial help; the
Commonwealth decision would deter-
mine whether or not the State Govern-
ment’s $50,000 contribution would be
boosted.


INTERNATIONAL
THE
MONEY
MESS
This float in the famous Rose Monday Carnival parade in Germany is called “His
Most Beloved Toy. It shows President de Gaulle leading the European Economic
Community horse with an Englishman behind ... waiting for the horse manure
THE CONSEQUENCES of the Bonn
disagreement about currencies are
lamentable. The German mark has
maintained itself in a state where it is
obviously too cheap in relation to the
other major currencies of the world.
Sooner or later, there is going to be
another run into it.
There can be argument about when
this is most likely to come. The run
might start in a few days, as soon
as the markets have absorbed the brief
reflux from the short-term betting
money which had been unsuccessfully
wagered on the mark actually upvalu-
ing last week; or it might come in a
few weeks, after the publication of the
next disappointing British or French
monthly overseas trade returns; or a
bit later, with the first big outbreak
of social unrest resulting from President
de Gaulle’s measures; or during the
approach to next September’s general
election in Germany, as speculators
ponder that post-election necessities
there might seem different from pre-
election ones; or after that election,
when the German authorities may nip
the small inflationary bud which quite
probably will give Germany tem-
porarily above-average imports next
year; or at any other manifestation of
speculators’ tulip time.
Anyway, the timing does not matter.
The point is that this basic disequilib-
rium between a too cheap mark and too
dear neighboring currencies has been
left in being in the market, and, of
course, something is going to happen
some day to signal to people that they
had better move money to bet on a
disequilibrated building falling down.
When the run starts, it will be into
marks out of the least desirable avail-
able currencies. At present the two
least desirable are the French franc
and sterling. A competition in deflation
is therefore starting between Britain
and France to try to ensure that the
other will be unseated when the music
stops.
If President de Gaulle’s deflation
manages to appear to improve France’s
external finances by more than Mr.
Jenkins’ deflation appears to improve
Britain’s external finances, then the
next run into the mark will be a run
out of sterling; there will then be
another'familiar sterling crisis, probably
met in this first instance by the familiar
borrowing, and familiar accompanying
decisions to tighten Britain’s squeeze
still further, on the familiar interna-
tional agreement that another sterling
devaluation should be avoided at all
costs.
If as at present seems more likely
France is in more trouble when the
next run into the mark begins, it is
highly probable that France will meet
this situation by a considerable devalua-
tion: by something like 25 percent,
rather than the gentlemanly 10 percent
or so which was discussed at Bonn
before President de Gaulle’s veto, when
M. Ortoli was agreeing with the other
nine finance ministers how jolly it
would be if they all pretended to hold
the (almost certainly mistaken) view
that a unilateral franc devaluation of
that order was one which all other
currencies could bear without subse-
quent tummy-rumbling. If the French
franc was devalued by something like
25 percent, even the British Govern-
ment would agree that sterling and
other currencies would have to go
down, too. So the most probable prize
for any victory in this heroic battle to
prevent one sort of forced devaluation
for sterling would be to arrive
triumphantly at a situation which
would require another sort of forced
devaluation for sterling, in conditions
of rather greater chaos.
The British Government has there-
fore dropped with a plop back into the
same trap as imprisoned it all the way
through from 1964 to November, 1967.
It will once again be the policy of Her
Majesty’s Government in the fore-
seeable future to introduce successive
squeezes and other temporary crisis
measures every few months, in order
once again bravely to try to avert a
devaluation, which once again—in so
far as one is talking of devaluation as
between sterling and D-mark—cannot
eventually be avoided by squeezes and
other temporary crisis measures
anyway, because the need for it is
an expression of a fundamental
equilibrium and not just a vague
warning sign that the British and
German trade cycles have become
temporarily out of kilter.
The outgoing Administration in
Washington has been passionately
opposed in its last days to the possi-
bility of any currency being devalued
anywhere, for fear that it pose a threat
to the dollar. That was why President
Johnson was prevailed on by his
officials to send that fulsome telegram
of congratulations to President de
Gaulle last week when the old man
decided to ignore realities for a little
while longer by sticking to his over-
valued rate. But many of the econo-
mists who have been advising Mr.
Nixon while out of office are known
to be ardently opposed to rigidly fixed
exchange rates, as the majority of other
American professional economists
probably now also are. The men around
Mr. Nixon would almost certainly like
to see the world move to some system
whereby exchange rates were allowed
to fluctuate by, say, 5 percent on each
side of parity.
As things are, however, it is likely
that when President Nixon comes to
Washington the world will still be
pretending that the patchwork disagree-
ment at Bonn might work, and that
nobody will have taken the first leap
to flexibility. Mr. Nixon himself will
then probably delay advance, until the
next international financial crisis,
which the ostriches’ convention at
Bonn has made virtually inevitable,
breaks on the world. Then there will
be another Bonn, during which there
will be some alteration in exchange
rates, and probably some widening of
margins, but with pressure on every-
body to be very conservative, and
please not to change rates by the full
extent made desirable by the funda-
mental disequilibrium, and please
not to bring in real and smoothly
self-adjusting and forward-moving
reforms like the crawling peg so
that there will then probably have to
be a third Bonn later, after another
major crisis and several further twists
in the Franco-British competition in
deflation.


Why money keeps
getting into a mess
What happened to the French?
THE UNDERCURRENTS were there
for a long time, but it was the increase
in the French bank rate from 5 to 6
percent on November 12 that sparked
off the explosion.
Ever since the French riots of last
May and June, people have w r ondered
whether the General might not be
eventually forced to devalue the franc.
What mattered in those riots was not
Danny the Red but the striking workers.
To get them back at their lathes, the
French Government had to concede
massive wage increases. These looked
like increasing French prices by some-
thing like 10 percent. This, it was
argued, would seriously weaken
France’s competitive position in world
markets. Its exports became more
expensive at the very moment its inter-
national-payments position looked like
moving into deficit after a glorious run.
of surpluses. Those surpluses had
allowed France to build up reserves of
$6OOO million, and General de Gaulle
was prepared to use that money to ride
out the storm rather than see the franc
—pride of his regime—humbled in
devaluation.
The one course open, to France, to
beat those wage increases without
devaluing, w'as to increase productivity
—produce more goods wfith the same
number of workers. France chose this
course in mid-September. The aim was
to hold dowm prices, allowing the extra
wages in the workers’ pockets to be
reflected in higher demand for goods.
This, in turn, would stimulate output
and therefore improve productivity.
The omens looked good. In June,
France had lost $lOOO million of
reserves, but by August the outflow had
dropped to $250 million. Then the
outflow started to pick up again: the
French themselves began to doubt the
wisdom of Government policy. They
started to move their money out of
France. The Government got the wind-
up w'hen the reserves fell to $3OOO
million. It then raised bank rate.
It w'as the same old mistake that
Britain had made so many times before.
There was a time when an increase in
the bank rate stilled jittery nerves:
now' it convinces the nervous that all
hell is about to break loose. The reason:
because that is w'hat had happened on
each occasion in the past.
This time no exception, and
there was a heaven-sent haven for all
that hot money—Germany. It w’as the
gamble of a lifetime. Britain eventually
Two financial writers of the London
“Observer,” Anthony Bambridge and
Alan Day, discuss the what, could,
why, and how of the money crisis.
devalued because it had been living
beyond its means for years, and, like
Mr. Micaw'ber, seemed incapable of
getting out of the hole. The pound was
too expensive in. relation to other cur-
rencies. The Germans have been run-
ning massive payments surpluses for
almost as long as Britain had made
deficits: the mark was just as clearly
undervalued in relation to other cur-
rencies. Everyone wanted German
exports because they were so cheap.
The prospect was of a cut in the
value of the fran.c and an increase in
the value of the mark. Anyone who
sold francs and bought marks stood a
good chance of making a double kill-
ing. The flow into Germany became a
flood, and, as in almost every previous
crisis, the attempts to stem the specula-
tion were both too little and too late.
They merely served to swell the flood
until, on Wednesday, November 20,
Europe’s leading foreign exchange
markets w r ere closed.
Could the crisis have been avoided?
THIS PARTICULAR crisis? Almost
certainly, although the sickness in the
international monetary system would
probably have erupted in some other
form, and will go on erupting until
adequately reformed. The franc crisis
will not be the last.
The French Prime Minister, M.
Couve de Murville, went too far when
he suggested on television that
France’s problems were merely the
reflection of Germany’s monetary crisis.
None the less it is a fair bet that had
Germany revalued its currency, say, six
months ago by around 10 percent,
France might not have had to face
devaluation now' and the British Chan-
cellor’s measures would have been far
less swinging.
Had Germany revalued, life would
have been easier for two reasons. First,
the mark would not have acted as a
magnet and fewer francs would have
fled France. Second, the balance of
payments of Britain and France wmuld
have been stronger and better able to.
withstand any speculative pressures.
When Germany earns a surplus on
its foreign trade of $2OOO million it is
balanced by equivalent deficits else-
where in the world. Countries sw'eat
to put things right by squeezing their
citizens’ pockets. Germany’s trading
success was marvellous for Germany,
but hell for the rest of Europe.
Why was Germany stubborn?
IT SEEMED CRAZY. After all, a
revaluation ought to be a reward for
hard work, just as devaluation is the
price one pays for failing to sell abroad
more than one buys from abroad.
Last November, the sterling crisis,
and devaluation
Everyone now knows that devaluation
cuts the value of the money in your
pocket. Equally, a revaluation of the
mark would have increased the real
income of the average German. The
mark in his pocket would have been
worth more. Rather than piling up
sterile reserves in the Central Bank the
money could have been spent on con-
sumption.
True, revaluation would have hurt
those exporters only just scraping a
living. They would have been priced
out of their markets, since German ex-
ports would have become dearer. What
really worried German politicians, how-
ever, were the farmers. They would
have suffered from the inflow of cheap
agricultural products. No political
party likes hurting farmers, and Ger-
many, for all its industrialisation, still
has a large farming population. A
revaluation would have found them all
voting the wrong way at next Sep-
tember’s election.
At the same time, there is some-
thing terribly final about revaluation.
The move from surplus to deficit can
be awfully sudden: France is a horrify-
ing example of just how sudden. Last
November the French gloated over the
British devaluation. Fear that to
revalue now would be to tempt fate
is perfectly understandable in a country
that has suffered the financial chaos
that Germany went through in the
inter-war years and after World War 11.
Especially now that Germany is throw-
ing uneasy glances at the other defeated
nation in that war: Japan is coming
up fast on the outside lane, and although
the German trade surplus is huge it
could be lost all too easily to Japan.
Why does Britain always suffer?
O.N THE FACE of it this was a quarrel
between the franc and the mark: Ger-
many refusing to revalue, Fra: ee refus-
ing to devalue. Yet, as always, the poor
pound was dragged in and knocked to
the floor. As always, the Bank of
England had to spend its precious
reserves of foreign currencies to buy
pounds from foreigners to prevent the
total collapse of sterling.
No one can run a payments deficit
as long as Britain has without huge
amounts of its currency getting into the
bank accounts of a lot of foreigners.
Said one London merchant banker:
“Everyone always has pounds.” When


May this year, an international
rescue operation for the dollar
Reopening last week of the Paris
Bourse after a five-day closure
there is the chance of a profit it is
those pounds that are sold. On this
occasion they all moved into marks.
People have also moved out of pounds
on the view that if there is a major
reshuffle the pound is likely to move
down rather than up. Yet, it was only
a year ago that the pound was
devalued. In effect that devaluation, by
14.3 percent, only served to move
Britain from the weakest to the second
weakest currency in Europe. It is a
sign of how much further Britain has
to go to make devaluation work. Until
Britain gets its payments into balance
the pound will remain weak and will be
the victim in each currency crisis no
matter how often Britain devalues.
Why Germany's great success?
GERMANY’S EXCHANGE RATE was
fixed in 1949 when the country was
still an industrial ruin. The rate
rejected this fact. But as industry
revived the mark became seriously
undervalued and Germany was
launched on its unstoppable miracle.
The revaluation in 1961 of 5 percent
made almost no difference to a country
bowling along on an export-led boom.
Best of all, however, Germany doesn’t
have to spend foreign exchange on
supporting the Army of the Rhine.
The danger is that Germany has come
to believe that its undervalued mark
springs from the successful management
of its economy when, in fact, the
reverse is true. Success has sprung from
the undervaluation.
This is not a situation that any
other industrial country can enjoy. In
theory it would pay Britain to launch a
mighty devaluation that would under-
value the pound. In fact, all that would
happen is that Britain’s trading rivals
would devalue by the same amount,
wiping out any advantage. This is
why Britain devalued by only 14.3 per-
cent last November: anything more and
others would have followed. To get into
Germany’s enviable position you really
do have to see your industry devastated
by war.
Who is to blame?
BANKERS AND POLITICIANS both.
Some more than others. General de
Gaulle more than most. It was, after
all, his style of government which led
to the May and June riots.
More important has been his burning
desire to break the financial power of
the dollar and with it the pound. This
was part of his vision that Europe
should rise as a third force between
the super powers. Like everyone else he
saw that the world monetary system
was in a mess. But he wanted to
return to the gold standard. The other
great trading nations were inclined to
the view that the credit available to
finance trade between nations should
be man-made, tailored to fit the world’s
needs. Not determined by the arbitrary
output of the world’s gold mines.
The growth in world trade has Jar
outstripped the amounts of newly
mined gold available and a return to
the gold standard would have demanded
a substantial increase in the price of
gold. It was this that the General
sought, happy in the knowledge that
the dollar, as the only currency tied
directly to gold, would in effect be
devalued if the price of gold rose. To
the General nothing could be more
humiliating for a currency than
devaluation.
Although the General did his level
best to wreck all attempts to reform
international money, he could fairly
argue that part of the blame for recur-
ring money crises must rest on the
Anglo-Saxons. Time and again, through
his finance ministers, he lectured on the
need for Britain and America to correct
their .persistent payments deficits. He
pointed out that no reform could be
possible until these had disappeared, and
the rest of Europe agreed with him.
This failure on the part of Britain
and America has been a major
contribution to the instability of world
currencies.
Fifteen years ago when the franc or
the lira looked shaky no one worried.
The first post-war money crisis was in
1957 when the possibility of a revalua-
tion of the mark put pressure on sterl-
ing. That was the occasion when Britain
first put the bank rate up to seven per-
cent. Those were the days when an
increase in the bank rate actually
worked. Since then, as the balance of
payments troubles of Britain and
America have grown, so the world
money system has got more shaky.
Why do we keep on having crises?
BECAUSE OUR MASTERS treat
exchange rates as totems to be wor-
shipped rather than prices to be
changed. Yet the price of a currency is
no different from any other price. No
one expects the price of potatoes to
remain the same year in, year out. Or
as “The Economist” puts it, no one
would think to “close down all green-
grocers’ shops for three days in order
to try to prevent any change ever taking
place in the relative prices between
carrots and peas.”
Fixed exchange rates offer'the com-
mercial community considerable advan-
tages. Never knowing from one day
to the next what a currency was going
to be worth would hardly persuade
manufacturers that exporting was fun.
But to take this to the extreme of never
altering exchange rates is crazy. Just
like carrots and peas, currencies do get
out of line. Rather than recognise this,
we seem to prefer to sit through crisis
after crisis while speculators gamble
that reluctant governments will eventu-
ally have to pocket their pride and
change the value of their currency.
Back in 1944 the Bretton Woods
Conference, which established the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, recognised that
persistent deficit countries should
devalue and that those with persistent
surpluses should revalue. Under the
Bretton Woods agreement economic
pressure could be exerted against
countries running heavy surpluses but
who refused to revalue. Its trading
partners were allowed to declare the
currency scarce and then to impose dis-
criminatory restrictions on imports from
it. Had the world lived up to Bretton
Woods, the mark would long ago have
been declared scarce and German
imports into Britain would carry a
heavy impost. It is still not too late.
Until governments recognise that
there must be some mechanism to adjust
exchange rates we are going to continue
to suffer from currency crises. And they
are becoming more and more frequent.
So what can be done?
EUROPE’S FINANCIAL CRISIS is
a direct consequence of the unnecessary
rigidity of the international monetary
system. So long as each country
regards any significant change in its
exchange rate either upward or
downward as a national defeat in
the last ditch, the international system
will continue to operate under quite
unnecessary strain.
It was clear for many months that
the German mark was undervalued.
Correspondingly, the French franc
was clearly overvalued for some time:
since the cost inflation induced by the
May revolution, it had been abundantly
clear that it was becoming seriously so.
Yet such is the rigidity of the inter-
national monetary system that the
necessary adjustments could take place
only after attempts to shore up a
crumbling structure of exchange rates

had been accompanied by speculation
and rumors which took a heavy toll
on currencies such as sterling and the
dollar, whose true role in the situation
was neutral.
The present rigid exchange-rate
system has been enshrined in the
dogmas of two major international
institutions the International Mone-
tary Fund and the European Economic
Community. The IMF articles of
agreement established the “adjustable
peg” system: under this, exchange
rates would normally be pegged within
narrow limits, but would be altered
from one peg to another after inter-
national consultation if a country’s
balance of payments were in “funda-
mental disequilibrium.” In fact, these
changes have been rare.
The Common Market system is
even more rigid. Probably the biggest
folly of the Common Market has been
to build everything on the assumption
that exchange rates between the mem-
bers would be immutable before there
was any approach to a common, central
determination of economic policies of
the kind found in federal States. So
long as the Common Market is a loose
confederation, it is essential to accept
that exchange - rate changes should
take place between the members to
absorb the effects of different rates of
economic growth, different domestic
policies, and different speeds of infla-
tion.
Precisely the same argument applies
to the economic relationships between
all the other major countries of the
world. It is folly to assume that
exchange rates can remain immutable
for long periods in a world in which
governments are committed to full
employment and where national growth
rates differ markedly. Yet this assump-
tion has been fashionable for almost
two decades. The remarkable fact is
that events have taken so long to
demonstrate its folly.
Is the solution, then, to go to the
other extreme and leave exchange
rates to be determined purely by the
market forces of supply and demand,
so that they are entirely flexible? This
has its intellectual attractions. But it
is based on a misconception of the
true situation. The central problem is
that of the structure of exchange rates
between, say, six of eight major
currencies, in that we have a “small
group” situation which does not
correspond to the assumptions of the
free market model on which the,
advocacy of perfect flexibility is based.
In this small-group situation it would
be necessary for everyone of the lead-
ing countries to be prepared at all
times to leave exchange rates to market
forces and not interfere in any way.
If any one of the governments of
these countries were to take a position
in the foreign-exchange market, its
political and administrative decisions
would partly determine the foreign-
exchange value of the currencies of
the other major countries. In such
circumstances it would be extremely
difficult for the other governments to
restrain themselves from also inter-
fering with free-market forces. It is
one thing to allow your exchange
rate to be determined purely by market
forces: it is quite another possibility
to accept that it is partly determined
by the political decisions of another
government.
It is hard to conceive that the
governments of all the major
countries would be prepared to with-
draw completely from any active
operation in the foreign - exchange
market. The exchange rate is very much
a matter of domestic politics —as is
seen at the moment in Germany, where
a revaluation would undoubtedly make
the average German more prosperous,
but where certain special groups
(notably the farmers) would suffer. As
present events also show, the exchange
rate is a matter of international
political prestige, which is lost by a
devaluation, but which can be enhanced
(as the Germans are showing) by
making the most of the economic
embarrassment caused to other countries
when your exchange rate is undervalued.
The squirrel mentality of the Germans
is hard to understand, but if they
choose to pile up wealth in the form
of huge currency reserves by means of
an undervalued exchange rate, it is
difficult for anyone else to prevent
them. The answer must be to try to
see that there is enough international
liquidity in existence to satisfy every
country’s demands.
A system of flexible exchange rates
influenced purely by market forces is
therefore out of the question. The
problem is to develop arrangements
with greater flexibility than we have
today, while accepting that political
factors will inevitably play a role in
determining the pattern of exchange
rates between the major currencies. In
doing so, it is also desirable to avoid
two difficulties that arise once it is
accepted that exchange rates are not
permanently immutable. These are the
dangers of destabilising speculation
when changes of rates are in prospect,
and the dislike of many businessmen
for uncertainty about exchange rates.
One approach which deserves the
careful consideration of governments
and bankers is the so-rcalled “crawling
peg.” Each government would agree
not to alter its exchange rate more
than, say, 4 percent in any one year.
This would allow quite big adjustments
to be made within fairly short periods of
time and, if used sensibly, could pre-
vent the development of major imbal-
ance. At the same time it would mean
much smaller opportunities for specu-
lators than the present adjustable peg
system and would not create major
uncertainties for businessmen, who
could in any case cover on the forward
market.
The most important thing, however,
is for governments and central banks
to accept that the present system is too
rigid with the consequence that when
adjustments become unavoidable the
strains are unnecessarily large.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
PUEBLO RETALIATION?
THE UNITED STATES may be plan-
ning to seize two North Korean fish-
processing ships, now being built in the
Netherlands, as a means of obtaining
the freedom of the 82 Pueblo crewmen.
The New York “Times” Washington
bureau reported that “American agents”
in Rotterdam have been ostentatiously
displaying great interest in the ships,
in an apparent effort to arouse appre-
hension in North Korea that one or
both vessels might be seized c.a their
voyage home from the Netherlands.
Since the North Koreans seized the
U.S. intelligence vessel Pueblo and
imprisoned its crew last January, they
have kept their sizable fishing fleet
within territorial waters, out of fear that
the U.S. might seize a vessel in retalia-
tion.
A North Korean captain and crew
are said to be in Rotterdam to take
delivery of the first of the large fish-
factory ships, but a spokesman for the
Verolmes United shipbuilding yards in
Rotterdam declared a Dutch crew
would deliver the 7000-ton Kuemgang
San to North Korea in January under
the Dutch flag. He said the vessel would
actually be a Dutch ship until trans-
The Kuemgang San in the Rotterdam
shipyard—UPI photo
ferred in Pyongyang to the Korea
Equipment Import Corporation.
The U.S. has made no outright threat
of seizure. However, one State Depart-
ment official pointed out: “North Korea
has milked about as much propaganda
from the Pueblo seize as it can expect.
Rather than run the risk of losing an
expensive vessel on the high seas, it may
be willing to turn the Pueblo crew back
and close the books on the incident.”
Other officials believe the biggest
obstacle to a settlement of the Pueblo
incident is not the nature of a demanded
apology from the U.S. but the timing
of the crew’s release.
American officials believe Russia has
been exerting pressure on North Korea
to release the Pueblo crew. The Soviet
Union operates a large fleet of eaves-
dropping ships similar to the Pueblo
all over the world, and is reportedly
uncomfortable about the Pueblo inci-
dent. Two Russian intelligence ships
have recently been seized and held tem-
porarily, one by Brazil and the other
by Argentina.
The fishing industry is important to
North Korea because fish provide up
to 70 percent of the animal protein in
the national diet. Since its home waters
are “over-fished,” North Korea needs
large factory ships to venture into dis-
tant fishing grounds to process and
deep-freeze the catch. North Korea has
contracted to pay the Rotterdam ship-
builders about $U.S.14 million for two
factory ships capable of processing
300,000 pounds of fish daily.
"YEV'S" DEFENDERS
TWO LEADING AMERICANS, play-
wright Arthur Miller and novelist
William Styron, have taken strong
issue with those English writers who
recently castigated poet Yevgeny Yevtu-
shenko as a “propagandist” for the
Soviet Union. “The attack on Yevtu-
shenko in Britain is scandalous,
cowardly in general, and false in its
particulars,” said Styron, who received
the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for his novel
“The Confessions of Nat Turner.”
The “Spectator” and the “New
Statesman” recently carried attacks on
Yevtushenko by Tibor Szamuely and
Kingsley Amis, in connection with his
unsuccessful candidacy for the post of
poetry professor at Oxford University.
Styron, who has known Yevtushenko
intimately for four years, commented:
“To characterise him as a ‘hack propa-
gandist’ and a ‘squalid pseudo-liberal
abhorred by all his liberal colleagues,’
is not only patently untrue but is to
slander a man who, perhaps more than
any qther of his contemporaries, has
been an outspoken and courageous
critic of the oppressiveness of official
Soviet policy.”
Miller, who won a Pulitzer in 1949
for his drama “Death of a Salesman,”
declared: “From his first disputes with
Khrushchev, when nobody knew what
the penalties might be, through his
challenge to anti-Semites in his poem
‘Babi Yar’ to the present day, Yev-
tushenko has been a voice of conscience
among his colleagues. I have never
heard anything to contradict that in
the Soviet Union. He was the first
writer to oppose the Soviet regime’s
rules and regulations about silence, and
those early acts of defiance were extra-
ordinarily courageous — things never
to be forgotten.”
CURRENCY DEFENCE
IN THE LIGHT of the world cur-
rency crisis, the central banks of the
leading Western nations were consider-
ing adoption of a new form of credit
arrangement that would offset massive
flows of funds from one currency to
another, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Fowler disclosed in Washington.
The aim of the new arrangement, if it
could be implemented, would be to
Secretary Fowler on U.S. television
during the money crisis—UPI photo
“recycle” funds that were believed to
be speculative. In a future crisis similar
to the present one, for example, West
Germany would promptly give back to
France the speculative money Germany
had taken in.
The new plan would probably be
negotiated through the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements in Basle, where the
leading central bankers meet each
month to adjust international accounts.
Hopefully, it would prevent rapid and
massive drains on the reserves of a
country in difficulty, drains, which in
turn, stimulate still more speculation
in expectation of a devaluation of the
currency under pressure.
Fowler pointed out that the arrange-
ments would “make speculative out-
flows rather meaningless in terms of
the ability of a country to defend its
currency.” Should France, for example,
lose reserves in defending the franc
against a speculative wave, she would
get the reserves right back from coun-
tries to which the volatile funds were
flowing. The plan was viewed as an
outgrowth of the seven-year-old device
of “currency swops,” which began on a
modest scale but is now a major defen-
sive weapon for the stability of cur-
rency values, and of the monetary
system itself.
MORE FOR B1AFRA
THE ALARMING increase in starva-
tion in secessionist Biafra has led to
the formation of an emergency task
force within the State Department,
headed by Under-Secretary of State
Nicholas de B. Katzenbach. The force
will work “around the clock” to attempt
to alleviate the situation.
American officials are reportedly
committed “both professionally and
emotionally” to a quick victory by the
Nigerian Government as the only true
solution to Biafran starvation. Mean-
while, they will attempt to increase
the amount of food reaching the re-
maining seven million beleaguered in-
habitants. By next month, Americans
estimate, half the population of Biafra
will be “in jeopardy” of starvation.

prevent starvation on a mass scale, of
adults as well as children, is now set
at 40,000 tons for next month alone.
At the most, only one-tenth of this total
is arriving in Biafra on erratic and
risky night flights by planes operating
from the nearby islands of Fernando
Po and Sao Tome. The planes are
chartered by the International Commit-
tee of the Red Cross and by United
States and European voluntary church
agencies.
The Biafran authorities, headed by
Lieut - Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu,
recently refused U.S. pleas to permit
day flights into Biafra. Ojukwu fears
that the Nigerian Government would
demand in return the neutralisation
of the sole Biafran airfield at Uli, which
would hamper the arrival of arms for
the Biafran Army from French sources.
These arms have so stiffened Biafran
resistance that there is now little ex-
pectation of an early federal victory,
Americans fear.
"MADE IN SPACE"
“PERFECT BALL-BEARINGS” are
among a variety of products that might
be efficiently manufactured in orbiting
space stations, Dr. George Mueller, of
NASA, speculated last week. “Liquid,
floating in a weightless environment,
takes the shape of a perfect sphere,” he
pointed out. “Thus it is conceivable
that metal ball-bearings could be manu-
factured to tolerances impossible on
Earth, yet at a cost, including trans-
portation, less than we now achieve.”
Development of space manufacturing
was one of the “most exciting” areas
for future development that NASA has
in sight. Products could include flaw-
lessly cast optical glass for lenses and
mirrors, extremely light construction
materials, turbine blades of variable
density, and versatile insulating
materials capable of withstanding
extreme temperatures.
However, such projects depended on
development of an economical space
shuttle f6r ferrying men and cargo
between Earth and orbiting space
stations. Development of such shuttle
craft would be America’s “next major
thrust.”
“Basic design for an economical space
shuttle could also be the progenitor of
an aircraft for terrestrial point-to-point
transport,” the scientist observed. “No
place on Earth would be more than
one hour from any other.”
DJI LAS ON "NEW LEFT"
PRESENT-DAY SOVIET leaders are
carrying out the identical imperialist
policies of the Czars of Russia, former
Yugoslav Communist leader Milovan
Djilas declared. He sees little difference
between recent Soviet actions in eastern
Europe and the policies of 19th-century
Russian imperialism.
“There are only differences in ideas
and forms,” said Djilas in an interview
in New York. “In the earlier period
we had pan-Slavism and Russian ortho-
doxy as instruments. Today we have
Leninism. The present Soviet bureauc-
racy is a continuation of the Czarist
bureaucracy.”
Djilas, once heir apparent to Presi-
dent Tito, is a visiting fellow at
Princeton University in New Jersey.
Djilas served nine years in prison after
breaking with the Yugoslav regime and
rejecting Communism in favor of demo-
cratic socialism. “We now see that a
revolution cannot change a nation, its
tendencies, qualities, and traits,” Djilas
commented. “Revolution only changes
the form of power and property but not
the nation itself. Russia is going back
to the classical form of Russian military
imperialism, is less and less an ideologi-
cal power and more a military power,
and may in future become an economic
power.”
Djilas sees the “New Left” movement
in Europe and America as a form of
democratic socialism —“some form of
transition to some new form of society.”
The essential thing about the student
movements was “that young people are
disillusioned with Communism, that is,
those classical forms of Communism—
Russian, East European, and Chinese.”
In Djilas’ view, Soviet Russia does
not fear Germany, “but China is a
different thing. China is a potential
power,” he observed. “She shares
historical rights to some parts of Russia.
This split in Communism between
Djilas lectures on Communism to
Princeton students —UPI photo
China and the Russians is definite. This
is not like a split between Yugoslavia
and Russia. This is a split between
great powers. Every Russian statesman,
great or small, must feel the danger
of China in the future.
“Because China cannot find room for
expansion except in Russia, and at the
same time she shares some historical,
even some national rights, for example
to Mongolia and some parts of
Siberia.” Djilas said there was no im-
mediate danger of Russia intervening
in Yugoslavia as it did in Czechoslo-
vakia. But if invasion came “we would
fight there is no prospect for a pro-
Russian government now.”

Handicaps to
the Vietnam
negotiations
WHEN the Saigon delegation to the
Vietnam peace talks arrives in Paris,
it will find itself at a heavy disadvan-
tage in three vital areas.
First, the Hanoi and National Libera-
tion Front delegations have already
established a formidable lead in pub-
licity, helped by the generally sympa-
thetic French attitude to their cause.
Secondly, while few, if any, experts
here believe there is much hope of
using the talks to chip away at the
disciplined unity between the represen-
tatives of Hanoi and the Viet Cong,
the South Vietnamese will have to
spend a good part of their energies
keeping a wary eye on their American
partners.
Finally, and most important, pres-
sures are building up here for just the
sort of political settlement of the war
which might well seem eminently
reasonable to the outside world and to
a considerable section of American
opinion, but which the Saigon Govern-
ment considers to be no less than its
own death warrant.
At present there seems to be no way
out of these difficulties for the South
Vietnamese. As for publicity, almost
everything now depends on Vice-
President Ky, the most expert headline-
catcher that Saigon has, who comes
as chief adviser to the South
Vietnamese team. But there is anxiety
on the allied side that Ky may make
the wrong sort of headline. Certainly
the French Press, tolerant of the evasive
generalities and propaganda that
usually come from the Communists,
may find occasion to hold Ky’s out-
spokenness against him.
As for relations between the
American and Saigon delegations, if
they are not actually bad, they are
leagues away from what they should
be at the start of long and difficult
talks. While everyone here gossips about
the excellent working relations between
the U.S. envoy, Mr. Cyrus Vance, and
his North Vietnamese opposite number,
Colonel Lau, it is no secret that the
Americans have not found it easy to
get on with South Vietnam’s
Ambassador Lam.
Typical of the lack of rapport was
the Americans’ feeling that Lam was
hysterical and lacking in self-confidence
in his handling of the crisis over
Saigon’s refusal to join immediately
in enlarged talks in Paris.
Other observers, however, point out
that Lam’s fears turned out to be an
accurate expression of his Govern-
The North’s side in Paris last week (chief negotiator Xuan Thuy at right)...
with French sympathy, a formidable lead in publicity -UPI photo
ment’s reactions. These observers also
feel that South Vietnam has a genuine
grievance over the extraordinary
imprecision of some of the agreements
reached between the Americans and the
North Vietnamese. They point to the
way that only last week the issue of
armed reconnaissance flights over North
Vietnam threatened to blow up into a
serious squabble simply because the
Americans had not extracted any
definite understanding from Hanoi that
such flights would be silently tolerated.
The South Vietnamese certainly fear
that American keenness on getting a
settlement could lead to more such
imprecise agreements, but this time in
really vital matters like troop with-
drawals, which would only play into
Communist hands.
Publicity for the Communists and
Saigon’s doubts about its American
partner are only part of the real danger
facing the South Vietnamese. Viet-
namese sources close to the NLF
make it plain that the neat American
solution of giving the Front a legal
political existence within the framework
of the existing South Vietnamese State
under the Government of President
Thieu is simply not on. Why, they ask,
should the Front stop fighting to
negotiate a settlement that would almost
certainly mean its eventual destruction?
Instead they talk pointedly of the
need for a third force within South
Vietnam that should be ready to lead
the country into peace and to deal
with the Front. They make this sound
like a Saigon equivalent of the alliance
of middle-class intellectuals that the
Communists created earlier this year.
The Saigon negotiators’ danger is
that they will be forced to look like
the one obstacle to peace by not agree-
ing to any such thing. It is conceivable,
for example, that while the United
States makes progress with Hanoi in
its part of the talks on such matters as
troop withdrawals and the future of
Indo-China after the war, the South
Vietnamese, having demanded and been
given control of the political side of the
talks, will be left behind isolated and
obstinate.
JAPAN
BUBBLING CAULDRON
AS IT HAPPENED, Mr. Sato coasted
home to his third term as Liberal Demo-
cratic Party president and Prime
Minister of Japan. A strong 249 Party
votes kept Sato heading the mainstream
for the time being, while former Foreign
Minister Takeo Miki received 107 votes,
Shigesburo Maeo 95, and the main anti-
Sato contender two years ago, Fujiyama,
a solitary vote.
At first sight, Mr. Sato’s ballot vic-
tory looks convincing enough, and really
the battle was all over well before poll-
ing day, when Shojiro Kawashima
started hinting that Sato was the winner
he was backing. But then, at second
sight, the victory is perhaps not quite
so impressive. Two years ago the anti-
mainstream vote was 170-odd for Mr.
Fujiyama. This time the Miki-Maeo
anti-mainstream vote totalled 202—in
other words, had 12 more LDP mem-
bers switched their vote, Sato would
have failed on the first ballot. Had one
of the intermediary factions, of which
Kawashima’s is the most important,
supported the Miki bandwagon, then it
might have really started to roll once
Maeo bowed out.
While a more lasting assessment must
await disclosure of the details of the
faction fighting that accompanied the
Party presidential election, it would
seem that Miki, while defeated, has not
been disgraced, and by coming second
has staked out a position which gives


him a chance of succeeding Sato in
two years’ time, or less. It is most
unlikely that he will now be invited
to participate in Sato’s new Ministry
and, equally, Sato’s chances will be
reflected in the team which emerges,
the factions which he placated, in his
new Cabinet lineup.
As always, the Japanese people were
not treated to a great debate during
the pre-election manoeuvring, but one
divergence between Sato and Miki did
emerge, which may well have far more
significance than just its effect on the
political futures of these two leaders.
“I don’t intend to debate Okinawa any
more, because it is not good for Japan
for us to raise this problem as one item
in the . presidential election,” said Mr.
Miki, but the fact was that the Okinawa
problem did obtrude amidst the fac-
tional infighting. Edging to the Left,
Miki took issue with Sato’s contention
that, if Japan insisted on the denuclear-
isation of the Okinawa American bases,
then reversion of the Ryukyus would
be delayed.
Implicitly, though never explicitly,
Sato seemed to be saying that the
nuclear umbrella must be retained even
if reversion was delayed thus avoid-
ing the difficult business of revising the
U.S.-Japan security treaty while
Miki implied that Japan should insist
on reversion, with the American bases
on Okinawa reduced to the non-nuclear
status that pertains on the Japanese
mainland. Implicit, too, in all this, Miki
seemed to be bending toward popular
sentiment, which is certainly less well-
disposed toward the Americans than is
Mr. Sato.
Of course, President Nixon may, if
he adheres to his pre-election statements,
find Sato’s viewpoint more congenial.
Both leaders may therefore delay the
issue of the reversion of the Ryukyus.
But this will only add a serious
emotional factor to the other unknown
in 1970, the continuance of the security
treaty. Miki justifiably criticised Sato
during the campaign for expecting a
confrontation of sorts on these issues
in that year. Equally among the Leftist
Parties, there is the expectancy that the
1960 disturbances will be repeated ten
years later, what with Kishi’s brother
being Japanese Premier and Eisen-
hower’s political brother now being
American President. Judged by the
number of those expecting 1970 to
demonstrate the mercurial nature of
Japanese politics, then Sato is in for
a bumpy ride and Miki seemingly has
put himself in a good position to take
advantage of that fact.
Equally, Sato has consistently done
better than his critics have anticipated
and consistently has not got sufficient
credit for it. If Miki’s failure only
further postpones the day when the out-
side world may find Japanese politics
interesting and the Japanese policy
more comprehensible, then ' Sato’s
success leaves a shrewd manipulator in
charge of Japanese affairs capable of
containing, if not soothing, what often
Election
banzais from
Prime
Minister Sato
(l.) and
Party Cabinet

appears to be a bubbling cauldron of
incompatibles.
Meanwhile, the lack of interest out-
side Japan in, the current leadership
contest is also worthy of note. To be
sure, as one Japanese observer put it,
“to me Japan moves ahead as much in
spite of as because of our political
leadership.” Certainly in the last
analysis the differences between the
factions and the LDP leaders are but
nuances compared to the gulf between
the ruling and the opposition Parties.
All the same, the day would appear fast
coming—if it hasn’t arrived already—
when even degrees of nuance by the
leadership of the world’s third-largest
economy will have widespread inter-
national repercussions.
UNITED NATIONS
CHINA ONCE MORE
From ANTHONY HAAS in Wellington
A CLOSE LOOK at Australian and
New Zealand statements on China in
the UN General Assembly in the past
two weeks shows some differences in
approach, although both oppose
representation.
This difference was shown in the
comments by New Zealand’s Mr. Frank
Corner and Australia’s Mr. Patrick
Shaw in the annual UN Debate on the
representation of Peking in the UN.
New Zealand voted in favor of a com-
mittee being established to consider
China’s membership, a move Australia
opposed. The resolution “recognises the
complexities of the question of China’s
representation,” Mr. Corner said. “For
our part, we think it unlikely that an
acceptable solution is possible without a
fundamental change in the attitude of
the Peking Government. Nevertheless,
we think the studies should enable the
assembly to cope more effectively with
the practical and technical problems
which will inevitably arise when that
change occurs.”
Mr. Shaw said: “We do not believe
the passage of such a resolution at this
stage would help us to arrive at the
goal which we are seeking, that is, a
situation in which all countries of Asia
and the Pacific accept a relationship of
mutual respect and understanding free
from threats and deeds of interference
in one another’s internal affairs. We
consider the wishes of the parties are
well enough known and we doubt
whether any formal proceeding of the
kind proposed would add to members’
knowledge of the situation nor that it
would at this stage make it more likely
that we would have favorable develop-
ments in that situation.”
Mr. Corner, in a speech which did
not go as far as Mr. Shaw’s in
“cataloguing Peking’s failures to act
as a responsible member of the interna-
tional community,” made a comment
not echoed in Mr. Shaw’s address. “New
Zealand,” he said, “in no way denies
the need for Communist China’s voice
to be heard and its legitimate concerns
to be taken into account when its
interests are directly affected.” Mr.
Shaw said the major task of our
diplomacy “is how to come to terms
with mainland China in a relationship
which will be one of respect, freedom
from fear and non-intervention in the
internal affairs of others.” Formosa
may provide the stumbling block in
recognition of Peking for some time, but
the subtleties in Peking’s overtures do
accentuate the subtleties and flexibilities
in Australian and New Zealand
responses.
COMMON MARKET
NEW MOVE NEEDED
THE MONEY CRISIS has raised many
questions about the political and econ-
omic future of Western Europe and its
relations with Britain and the United
States. In particular, it has shaken.
perhaps excessively—confidence in the
Common Market and in the Franco-
German relationship, which is the
Market’s firm foundation.
What, it is inevitably asked, is the
point of the Common Market, with its
doctrine of community action, if it can-
not prevent the kind of conflict between
the currencies of its two leading mem-
bers which we have just seen and which
could make nonsense of most of the
other laboriously negotiated - economic


agreements between the Six? It is true
that in retaining the values of the mark
and the franc both West Germany and
France followed the advice of the Euro-
pean Commission in Brussels. But this
was almost coincidental and the pro-
tectionist measures they took, instead of
altering the value of their currencies,
were adopted without reference to the
Commission.
Moreover, one of the main reasons
why the Commission advocated main-
taining the existing exchange rates also
illustrates one of the present handicaps
of the Market in dealing with currency
crises. The Commission’s advice was
given largely because of the still un-
settled problems of a common agricul-
tural policy. Revaluation of the mark
would have cut farm prices in Germany
and devaluation of the franc would
have increased food prices and agri-
cultural surpluses in France.
With prices virtually the only im-
portant point yet agreed in the com-
munity’s agricultural policy, the Six
have not yet been able seriously to
tackle the big problems of reducing the
huge number of inefficient farms, a hot
domestic political issue in every Euro-
pean country. Meanwhile, the burden
of farm subsidies is part of the price
paid for securing the customs union,
which is so far the Common Market’s
main achievement.
The present crisis has shown the
limited effect of a customs union unless
it is accompanied by more far-reaching
measures of joint economic manage-
ment, which imply a higher degree of
common political control or supra-
national Government. In this respect,
the Common Market is in a difficult
halfway position. If it is to succeed at
all, it has now to move forward to a
greater degree of economic integration.
The probable alternative is a slow
slide, backward, illustrated by the
present crisis, toward more nationalist
ideas of economic salvation, instead of
the international or community
approach which, behind all the complex
formulas and bargaining, is the essence
of the Common Market.
The main struggle hitherto in
Europe has not been between rival bids
for French and German hegemony but
between supporters of nationalism and
supporters of internationalism inside
both countries. While nationalism of
the Gaullist kind has in recent years
been dominant in France, Bonn has,
broadly speaking, remained faithful to
the European community idea. It is
notable that, despite the silly comments
of some German officials during Bonn
negotiations, the most sensible words
of the crisis have been spoken by Herr
Willy Brandt, the Social-Democratic
Vice-Chancellor, in his rebuke to
chauvinists of all kinds and his
reminder that all the peoples of the
West are in the same boat.
The real problem of Germany does
not lie in an attempt by Bonn to domin-
ate Western Europe but rather in the
latent conflict between Western Ger-
many’s membership of a Western
European political and economic union,
and her desire for national reunifica-
tion. This is a dilemma for which no
easy or quick solution is in sight. But
an all-European system of economic co-
operation and military security within
which German unity might one day be
achieved is unlikely to be encouraged
by the nationalistic fragmentation of
the West.
It is in this context of community
action versus nationalism, rather than
in the context of the old-fashioned bal-
ance of power, that Britain finds her-
self inevitably closer to the Bonn Gov-
ernment than to President de Gaulle.
Nevertheless, Britain has to recognise
that, for the West Germans, the alli-
ance with France is regarded as out-
lasting President de Gaulle and is only
matched in importance by their alliance
with the U.S.
Much depends not only on the atti-
tude of France but also of the U.S.
There have been slight signs of a thaw
between Washington and Paris. Presi-
dent-elect Nixon is said to attach the
highest priority to European affairs and
to have in mind a new approach to
President de Gaulle.
But he has yet to give some clear
indication of his future economic poli-
cies: and in the relations of the U.S.
to Western Europe economics and poli-
tics are closely linked together. Does
Mr. Nixon believe that he can succeed
in reconciling the apparently irrecon-
cilable and accept the Gaullist idea of
a Europe of nation-States without
abandoning the aim of an integrated
European community which has
hitherto had Washington’s support? Or
are his hopes of some new modus
vivendi with France limited to the field
Nigerian troops nearing “final objective” Umahia, which has not fallen
of defence? If in the political and
economic fields he fails to bridge the
gap, as many have failed before Mm,
is he more likely to try to give a new
impulse to the idea of European unity
or to accept the fact of Gaullism and
consider seriously ideas of a larger
Atlantic free-trade area?
A new attempt is obviously needed to
rethink and remould the international
political and economic institutions of
the Western world. But it cannot seri-
ously begin until the new administra-
tion in Washington has had time to
find its feet.
NIGERIA
ROAD TO STARVATION
NIGERIA’S CIVIL WAR is now
moving toward a grisly climax. Unless
there is an early cease-fire, a large part
of the seven-million Ibo people besieged
in the Biafra heartland will die in the
next few months. The deaths will occur
mainly among children under ten and
pregnant women.
Not even a massive air-relief opera-
tion will be very effective after
February-March, when the Biafra
heartland is likely to experience a
carbohydrate deficiency, threatening
the whole besieged population vith
actual starvation.
The chance of a cease-fire seems to
be receding. The Biafrans are getting
more arms and technical help from
French sources, and the Federal Gov-
ernment is also widening its range of
military supplies in case British and
other Western Governments should
decide to change their arms policy. In


recent weeks the Federals have
begun to follow the Biafrans in
tapping supplies offered by Europe’s
clandestine arms dealers and they have
begun to buy arms not only aircraft,
as hitherto from the Russians. So
even if there were an arms embargo
by Britain, Lagos would be in a position
to find different allies to carry on the
war.
A Russian economic mission now
visiting Nigeria has been lavishly
praised on its tour of the country.
This has been especially notable in the
mainly Moslem States of Northern
Nigeria. Radio Kaduna broadcast that
“the Russians have proved themselves
Nigeria’s true friend.”
The Federal military leadership is
now giving high priority to putting
the remaining two airstrips in Biafra
out of action in order to stop the inflow
of French arms. The effect of this
policy which is being executed by
Nigerian pilots instead of Egyptians,
flying new types of Russian bombers—
is to disrupt the existing air relief
flights as well.
A British missionary, handling relief
supplies at Ulli airstrip, has provided
an eyewitness report of the effects of
this new policy. “Daylight attacks on
the airport have been intensified, but
are only moderately successful. So far,
there have been two raids while I have
been writing this, and there is still
time for a third before dark. We are
getting one or two raids almost every
day. On only one day so far were the
flights delayed and had to turn back,
but the runway was repaired and
ready by 8.30 p.m., so we missed only
two flights that night.”
He reports one successful night-flight
attack when a rocket landed in the
middle of people unloading a plane
belonging to Caritas, the Catholic
relief agency. It was an anti-personnel
fragmentation bomb that “hardly
scratched the surface,” but ten workers
died from their injuries and a pilot
and a Red Cross worker were wounded.
International relief agencies have
submitted their agreed findings to the
United Nations, urging world action to
avert a major human disaster. Their
chief concern is that the people in the
Biafra heartland—now twice its normal
population have begun to eat their
yam supplies early because of a general
shortage. What is even more alarming
is that they are eating seed yams as
well. Normally, the yam crop, which
is gathered in October, would last until
May. What is now left will be finished
by January or February at the latest.
Meanwhile, because of the shortage of
new seed, next year’s crop will be a
small one.
The conclusion is that within three
months the entire Ibo population in
the Biafran heartland will be in need
of a complete survival ration, whereas
at present their need is only for protein
supplementary foods which could, in
fact, be managed by a larger airlift.
A survey shows that the maximum
air delivery which could be achieved
for Biafra—without active Federal
co-operation—would be 1200 tons a day.
This would include air drops and land-
ings on available strips. Based on a
survival ratio of 265 grams, this would
help to support only 4,500,000 people
at just above starvation level.
But even such an effort would mean
that between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000
people would be certain to starve to
death—unless they chose to leave the
besieged area to find food and shelter
in the areas behind the Federal lines.
Yet even this limited target cannot be
achieved unless the international relief
agencies are provided with funds and
aircraft to increase their present sup-
plies eight times. This is the background
to the mass appeal issued last week by
the Disasters Emergency Committee of
Britain.
The British relief organisation
Oxfa’m has issued a special appeal to
“urge all whose eyes can be reached
with the news of the ghastly, horrifying
present and impending situation to
raise a loud alarum in the ears of the
British authorities to give priority now
to getting the fighting stopped, and,
secondly, to renew the call for financial
support to bring relief to the threatened
masses.”
As a means of dramatising the present
plight of Biafra, a Christmas ship,
carrying 5000 tons of medical supplies
and food, will sail from Amsterdam to
Sao To'me, via New York, on December
15. It is being organised by Luchtbrug
Biafra, Terre des Hommes, Amsterdam,
and Israel’s one-man peace mission,
Mr. Abie Nathan.
PORTUGAL
A NEW FRAMEWORK
DR. CAETANO, Portugal’s new Prime
Minister, has gone farther and faster in
liberalising his regime than seemed
likely when he took office two months
ago. But in a speech to the National
Assembly last week he slowed down the
pace. There had been rumors that he
would announce that political Parties
(except Communists) would be free
to operate for the first time. But
it was not to be. He only
remarked that “liberties will not be
allowed to subvert liberty.” With Dr.
Salazar still alive, and the Army wary
of change, he has to move carefully.
The Parties cannot work openly yet,
but it may come later on. At the
moment they can in theory put up
candidates at elections, but Pide, the
secret police, prevents them from
carrying out those normal day-to-day
political activities that would give
meaning to the act of standing for
election. Elections for the Assembly are
due next year and the Opposition has
already said that it is going to judge
Dr. Caetano by the way he runs them.
To let Parties operate more or less
freely would fit in with several moves
the Government has already made.
The “Diario da Manha,” the official
Party paper, announced recently that
Caetano...not as banal as he sounded
Opposition petitions calling for free
elections had reached the Prime
Minister. It was the first time that any
such announcement had been made. A
new Press law is to be introduced into
the Assembly next session and will
probably replace the existing censor-
ship with a modified system. The
official unions are free to elect their
leaders apparently without Government
intervention. Even the police have
absorbed .something of the new spirit.
They treated two recent student
demonstrations much more gently than
in the past; they did not arrive on the
scene equipped with steel helmets and
rifles as they invariably did under
Dr. Salazar.
Even if he were a completely free
agent, Dr. Caetano would not be a
fully fledged democrat. His political
taste is, in fact, said to be for a
corporate State along Mussolini’s lines;
moreover, he has to consider the
reactions of both the Army and the
police. None the less, when in his first
speech as Prime Minister he asked all
Portuguese “to work together to solve
the nation’s problems” he was not
being as banal as he sounded. He may
well have been hinting that groups
which accepted the framework of the
regime would be allowed to work
within it.
If they do, it is difficult to estimate
how effective they will be. Most of
the Parties will be very rusty after 40
years of hibernation; only the Com-
munists seem to have thrived in this
condition. Dr. Caetano may well want
the Catholic and moderate socialist
Opposition to develop a bit of real
muscle, in order to prevent all opposi-
tion from polarising on the extreme
Left. At the same time an Opposition
whose existence depended on his
remaining in office would strengthen
his hand with the extreme Right—once
he had found himself strong enough to
make it accept the Opposition at all.

CHINA
Warlords waiting in the wings
By PARRIS H. CHANG
IN THE TWO years since the Chinese
Communist leaders approved Mao Tse
Tung’s blueprint for the Cultural
Revolution, events in China have often
seemed like some obscure Elizabethan
history play with Ministers and Party
secretaries changing sides, forming
factions, then disappearing for a few
acts only to pop up again in new roles.
Now, as the end of the pageant
approaches, Army officers can be seen
waiting in the wings, ready to rush in
and seize the future.
It was in August, 1966, that Mao
called the historic 1 Ith plenary session
of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
After much heated discussion, he and
his supporters stripped all power from
President Liu Shao Chi (who was
finally officially ousted in October),
designated Marshal Lin Piao As heir
apparent, and approved a 16-point
decision to purge “those in the Party
who have taken the road to Capitalism.”
Perhaps most important, to intensify the
cleansing of Party ranks, Mao mobilised
the Red Guards.
Recognising that their own heads were
on the block when the Red Guards
began staging mammoth rallies, pro-
vincial Party officials hit back by
organising their own Red Guard units.
By early 1967, the resulting confronta-
tion had stalled the Cultural Revolution.
To resolve the impasse, Mao sent his
Red Guards into the countryside and
also exhorted “revolutionary rebels”
(working and lower-level cadre) to
wrest power from the provincial Party
apparatus. When the manoeuvre led to
further fighting, he ordered the
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to
intervene. This marked the first time in
CCP history that such large-scale force
had to be used to crush internal
opposition.
The PLA’s response reflected the
conflicting loyalties of many officers. In
six or seven provinces, the PLA assisted
the Maoists in seizing control from
the local authorities, but in another 20-
odd provinces the Army either adopted
a hands-off policy or actually intervened
against the Maoists revealing, among
other things, Lin Piao’s inability to
deliver the military.
As originally envisaged by Mao, the
primary objective of the Cultural
Revolution was to “seize power from
below” and usher in a new revolutionary
political order.
Instead, the incompetence and fac-
tionalism of the Leftists exposed the
weakness of his bases of support; the
power “seized” was quickly relinquished
to the military and former Party
officials (now transmogrified into
“revolutionary cadres”).
In the provinces and lower admini-
strative units, the basic element in the
new Chinese power structure is the
revolutionary committee, composed of
the People’s Liberation Army, “revo-
lutionary cadres” and the rebels, with
the PLA dominating.
It is doubtful that these committees
will act very differently from the men
they have replaced. Judging by their
performance in the past year, they will
pay little attention to Maoist principles,
many of which are obsolete.
Another goal of the Cultural Revo-
lution was the cultivation of “revo-
lutionary successors” armed to the
teeth with Mao’s thought. At first the
young Red Guards seemed enthusiastic
Mao Tse Tung,
now 75, and
his designated
heir, Lin Piao.
But serious
factional
fighting, the
wash-up of the
Cultural
Revolution, could
make the Army
the inheritor
of real power
about this; now they look more like
the careerists they really are than
revolutionaries.
Similarly, the rank-and-file Party and
Government cadre who joined the
revolutionary rebel groups obviously
wanted to get rid of superiors blocking
their own advancement.
Thus, two years after it began, the
Cultural Revolution failed. Mao has
succeeded in discrediting his real or
imagined opponents in the Party, but
he has denuded its ranks of veteran
leaders, shattered its organisational
machinery, and weakened its hold
over the country.
Even Mao apparently is disillusioned.
According to a report circulated in
Hong Kong, he broke down and wept
last July 28 at a Peking meeting with
five top Red Guard leaders. Bitterly
condemning them for their persistent
factional fighting, he reportedly said,
“You have failed me. And what is more,
you have disappointed the workers,
peasants, and soldiers of China.”
This disillusionment, plus pressures
from other sectors, probably accounts
for Mao’s reluctant approval of direct-
ives authorising military units to dis-
band Red Guard groups and suppress
infighting. Significantly, three days
after his interview with the student
leaders, the celebration of China’s Army
Day featured strong demonstrations of
support for the PLA.
In addition, on August 25 a long
article in “Red Flag,” the Party’s
theoretical organ, denounced the Red
Guards and intellectuals as vacillating
and unreliable, while hailing the workers
and peasants, acting in collaboration
with the military, as more sturdy
and dependable vehicles for carrying
through the Cultural Revolution. And
many later official statements from
Peking have underlined the downgrad-
ing of the students’ role.
Clearly China’s leadership has
decided to slacken the pace of its
effort. But irreparable damage to the
political system has already been done.
Of the Party’s 172 full and alternate
Central Committee members still alive
in July, 1968, 93 (or more than 54
percent of the total membership) have
been condemned as “three-anti
elements” (anti-party, anti-socialist,
and anti-Mao Tse Tung’s thought)
and purged. Another 24 have been
suspended from their positions or
deprived of their actual power. Only
55 (or slightly less than 32 percent
of the Central Committee member-
ship) are still in good standing.
The 93 disgraced members were
among China’s most active and power-
ful men, with impeccable revolutionary
credentials. They included the Chief
of State, 12 Politburo members, 11
Secretariat members, 17 Provincial
First Secretaries, seven Deputy
Premiers, 42 Ministers and Vice-
Ministers in the Cabinet, and five
Deputy Chairmen of the Congress.
The purge of top regional and pro-
vincial officials over the past two
years has been equally extensive. Of
67 officials identified as Secretaries
and alternate Secretaries in the Party’s
six regional bureaus in 1966, 37 have
been disgraced as “three-anti” elements
(including four regional bureau First
Secretaries), while only 13 are still
active. Among the 29 First Secretaries
of China’s provincial-level Party Com-
mittees, 20 have been purged as “three-
anti” elements, two have been sus-
pended, one has committed suicide,
and five are flourishing.
It can be argued that by pushing
out a large number of aging Party


officials at all levels, the Cultural
Revolution has generated a high degree
of upward political mobility. In fact,
this appears to be the most significant
positive achievement of the political
turmoil of the past two years. But a
second look at the thoroughness and
speed with which the leadership has
been decimated reveals that the price
of this accomplishment far exceeds its
value. Indeed, the purges have been a
traumatic shock to the Chinese body
politic.
The Party as an institution has been
virtually destroyed. At the centre, the
Secretariat and various departments do
not seem to be functioning. In the
provinces, the local provincial Party
authorities have ceased to exercise any
authority since the seizure of power by
Red Guards in January, 1967. This
breakdown of Party rule has gravely
impaired the functioning of political
and control mechanisms in China.
Mao’s call to “rebel” against “those
taking the road to Capitalism” in the
Party and seize power from below has
had the effect of inculcating contempt
among Red Guards, rebels, and the
population as a whole for authority of
any kind. This attitude extends to the
authority of new “revolutionary” insti-
tutions and even the Central Govern-
ment itself. It will be a long time before
any Chinese leadership can again com-
mand a disciplined population. With the
Party machinery paralysed, only the
Peoples Liberation Army is left to pick
up the pieces. Indeed, it has become the
sole power in Communist China today,
with many PLA men already occupying
positions of civilian responsibility
vacated by purged victims.
Revolutionary committees have been
established in all 29 Chinese provinces,
and 21 of them are headed by a military
commander or a political commissar of
military rank. The current campaign
against so-called “polycentrism” indi-
cates that Peking is now alarmed by a
tendency toward regionalism and
political fragmentation fostered by the
Cultural Revolution.
During the past two years, the central
leadership has felt it increasingly neces-
sary to negotiate and bargain with
regional authorities, rather than com-
mand them directly. If the Party,
hitherto the most effective control instru-
ment of the central leadership, cannot
be reconstructed in some form, regional
leaders could further tip the balance in
their favor by building their own bases
of power.
Loyalty within China has become too
personal, focusing primarily on the
figure of Mao Tse Tung. Mao is 75
now. After he leaves the scene, we may
yet witness a recurrence of “warlordism”
in China.

INDIA
Exams no cheats need fail
By C. P. RAMACHANDRAN
POORLY PAID INDIAN lecturers in
the eastern State of Bihar have long
been nervous when called upon to super-
vise university examinations, because if
students are caught cheating they lie
in wait for the lecturer and beat him
up. Some have been stabbed. But a
new and ludicrous phase of student
anarchy seems to have been reached
with a demand that cheating be legit-
imised. Students of a Hindu university
in Deoghar, Bihar, are reported to have
refused to write their answer paper
unless they are allowed to use unfair
means.
Behind this lies a sorry tale of cor-
ruption and inefficient administration—
not only in education and a steady
consequent decline in the integrity and
standing of educationists. Often
students, after a brief glance at an
examination question paper, have simply
walked out claiming that the questions
were too difficult. And almost as often,
at the instance of politicians, a set of
new and easier papers has been set and
the examination held again.
Extending their own licence beyond
the school or lecture room, students
who travel by train deliberately avoid
buying tickets, threatening with knife
and stick any railway staff who detect
them. The State-owned railways are
estimated to be losing about the equiva-
lent of $450,000 from refusal to pay
fares. Respect for vice-chancellors and
senior authorities diminishes because of
popular belief that many of their ap-
pointments are made at the behest of
politicians. Lecturers who hold their
jobs by currying favor with their sup-
eriors are held in contempt. There are
constant complaints that merit ranking
in examinations is juggled in favor of
the children of influential parents.
Recently in the postgraduate course
in Science at a university in Patna,
capital of the State of Bihar, 18 out
of 20 students were placed in the first
class. Patna’s English-language daily
newspaper “Searchlight” alleged that
the explanation of this uncommon bril-
liance was as follows: “It is stated that
the son of a Very Important Person
got the 18th position despite every
undue leniency shown to him in the
examination. On merit he could not
get a first class. But he had to be placed
in the first class to please the VIP
concerned. So, grace marks, which are
generally given to students to prevent
mass failure, were given in this case
to upgrade the class. If the 18th student
had be to be placed in the first class,
others above him had also to move up.
Thus was a record created not only for
Patna University but in the whole
country.”
In Kerala State the names of lecturers
who mark examination papers are
painstakingly acquired by bribing ser-
vants and clerks. They are then ap-
proached by parents, and induced, some-
times with cash, to be large-hearted in
awarding marks.
These desperate efforts to acquire a
degree spring from the fact that in India
for any kind of white - collar job a
university degree is now imperative.
About 1,750,000 students cram various
courses in 2750 colleges affiliated to 70
universities. There are no standardised
textbooks. Syllabuses widely vary. The
North Indian universities have changed
the medium instruction to Hindi.
Madras has changed to Tamil. Other
universities are now teaching in one of
India’s 14 regional languages. The result
is that when men with college degrees
appear for Federal jobs before the Union
Public Services Commission, many can
barely understand the questions put to
them in English.
Two weeks ago, the Senate of the
Madras University noted that when a
group of candidates from their State-
appeared before the Services Commis-
sion in Delhi, they were “tongue-tied.”
The Senate then recommended that the
next meeting of the Commission should
be held in Madras, where, presumably,
pressures could be applied.
Under these conditions Indian col-
lege campuses have become seedbeds of
senseless violence. Students of Amritsar,
in Punjab, formed a procession a month
ago, protesting at police brutality to
some students of Ludhiana, 50 miles
away. About 605 of them waving long
staves and hockey sticks demonstrated
before the police premises. “Then,”
according to one report, “they marched
to a college, where they smashed glass
panes, on their way damaging private
cars. Some car-owners complained that
the hooligans molested women . . .”
The problem for India has been given
additional complexity by the obvious
signs that political parties see profit in
manipulating student unrest and its
violent potential. Campuses have been
turned into party recruiting grounds.
Recently there have been violent
clashes in Benares’ Hindu University,
Allahabad University, and Agra Univer-
sity (all in Uttar Pradesh) between
students who are said to be sympathisers
of the Hindu fascist-like organisation,
the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh
(RSS), and Leftish students.
Several lecturers were assaulted. The
Proctor of the Benares University was
stabbed and two universities are closed
for an indefinite period.
The flare-up in Uttar Pradesh is
related to mid-term elections for the
State Legislative Assembly in February
next year and the desire of political
parties to raise the tempo of the election
campaign. Uttar Pradesh is one of the
biggest strongholds of the Hindu
revivalist Jan Sangh, under whose wing
the secret RSS operates.

Koestler in
a “country of
innocence”
By RICHARD CAMPBELL
Barry Jones interviews noted
author Arthur Koestler on
Channel Seven’s “Encounter”
program. Jones has known,
and admired, Koestler for
some years and wanted him
to come here because he
“can’t bear to think that
people are missing out”
AT SOUTH MELBOURNE, Channel
Seven’s studio 2 is quiet. Barry Jones
sits at a table writing energetically and
a few cameramen make hurried prepar-
ations and then clown around. Jones
looks up, makes a booming comment
to no one in particular, twitches his
nose. His strong moustache bristles and
he returns to his notes and the books
at his elbow.
He has read again the main books
of his subject, slept on them, and then
sat down with a pen as the questions
came out. An ex-teacher, a lecturer in
European history, a partner in a
Melbourne legal firm, who worked
recently on Da Costa’s appeal against
the death sentence, and a weekly radio
and television broadcaster, Jones looks
up to find Peter Westerway, his pro-
ducer, who is about to supervise his
first “Encounter” taping.
“I think we should keep the Freud
part in,” Jones says. Westerway is easy,
thinks it may hold things up, but is
willing to leave it entirely up to Jones.
Relishing the revelation of a good
story, Jones smiles broadly and returns
to his notes. He is unabashed by the
subject of tonight’s “Encounter.”
Arthur Koestler will arrive at the
studio in half an hour, but there is no
suggestion of impending deference.
Jones begins to run through an intro-
ductory piece. It is angled personally:
the effect of four modern minds on
the younger Barry Jones. H. G. Wells
and Bernard Shaw, the systems men,
searchers for Utopias, builders of the
social construct. Then Orwell and
Koestler: anti-systems men, men who
raised a protest against retreats from
individualism. The duality of his
intellectual influences is laid bluntly,
with a lean toward the camera and
no care for protective sophistication.
Something is wrong with the take.
Jones repeats his introduction to
Koestler with the same no-nonsense
punch: these are his influences, aren’t
they yours, and, if not, what are yours?
Koestler lived through the maelstrom
of Europe to bear witness. “His famous
novel ‘Darkness at Noon’ is the classic
expose of Communist totalitarianism.”
Jones tells his audience, “Tonight we
will meet Koestler the man . . .”
If the horror, violence, despair, and
triumph of Europe is implicit it stops
short, and the cameramen begin some
backchat. After, the floor manager
makes a leisurely signal to end the
take. Koestler has arrived with his
young wife, Cynthia. Jones, between a
few comments and blinks, thinks of an
entirely fresh set of questions and
writes them down.
Koestler is no stranger to him. While
in Europe seven years ago he had
met Koestler through John Strachey
and Richard Crossman, two of the
guiding lights of the British Socialist
intelligentsia. Jones, also a committed
Labor supporter, had sought them out
to further his knowledge about a
political ruse that had long fascinated
him, front movements.
Strachey and Crossman told Jones
what they could and then handed him
over to the man who had seen it all
happen. From these meetings grew a
correspondence and Koestler’s help in
the agitation for the abolition of the
death penalty, after the Victorian
conviction of Robert Tait in 1961.
Jones was prominent among the aboli-
tionists and the information on the
front movements was filed away for
later use on his current doctoral thesis-
on the impact of front movements in
Australia.
Crossman and Strachey’s flirtations
with the Communist Party had been
tender in comparison with Koestler’s
union, and their politics had never
been quite the life-and-death struggle
of the European game. Koestler has
written: “At a conservative estimate
three out of every four people whom
I knew before I was 30 were subse-
quently killed in Spain, or hounded to
death at Dachau, or gassed at Belsen,
or deported to Russia, or liquidated in
Russia. Some jumped from windows
in Vienna or Budapest. Others were
wrecked by the misery and aimlessness
of permanent exile.”
When Jones found himself with his
own show he grew eager to bring
Koestler out from Europe. “I can’t bear
to think that people are missing out,”
Jones says. “I had to think that. It is
very important to me that people have

The fountain, set in Adelaide’s Victoria
Square, incorporates the largest single
aluminium casting ever made in Australia
The main basin is cast in one piece 11 ft.
across, and weighs 3940 lbs. The three
figures symbolising South Australia’s
three main rivers weigh 500 lbs. each.
The complete set of castings, in a high
silicon type aluminium alloy, was
produced by Castalloy Limited, Adelaide.
The Adelaide City Council commissioned
John Dowie to sculpt the fountain to
commemorate Queen Elizabeth’s visit in
1963. It was officially opened by Prince
Philip in May, 1968.
Maybe you don't intend to cast a statue.

the opportunity to be exposed to a
great range of ideas ... if Koestler’s
visit has the effect of increasing Koest-
ler’s readers by five percent I would
think I was doing bloody well.
“The important thing about Koestler
is that he has put up a one-man fight
a fight he may well lose in an
attempt to ask what meaningful things
we can say about the sciences so that
an intelligent layman has some sense of
what is going on and where things are
heading. He can give them a sense of
destiny.
“Science today is a bit like the
theory of the expanding universe: it
is spreading out and making discoveries
in all directions. But for the man in
the middle ... In the other two shows
when Koestler argues with people
like Sir Macfarlane Burnet, Oscar
Oeser people may see fundamental
disagreement between the experts on
things like free will and determinism.
People tend to think that the scientist
and the biologist have spoken and that
is final, but there are still many open
questions.
“And Koestler is not a populariser,
at least, not in the pejorative sense.
He grasps hold of a subject, rips it
apart, examines it, chews it, and welds
it together. Look at the bibliography
in the ‘Act of Creation’ . . . enormous.
“He has built a great intellectual
construct. The politics were the floor
and now he is more interested in the
second floor and the roof.”
Koestler comes in, the opposite of
the large and flamboyant Jones.
Koestler walks like a boxing trainer,
economically and firmly. His face
looks battered with another sort of
punch, but he seems trim and spare.
He complains about the heat and
asks if they need to sit with their
coats on. He takes off his blue serge
double-breasted jacket and when
assured that smoking will be OK he
looks happier. He tries to find his wife
with his eyes, but the lights make it
diffcult. He is not happy about that.
He wants to orientate himself and asks
where Westerway is: “Where is my
friend Peter?” A disembodied voice
answers: “Up here. The deus ex
machinal
Westerway is, like Jones, a man
deeply interested in politics. He has
lectured on the subject and stood as a
Labor candidate for Gosford, N.S.W. He
says he finds Koestler’s mind to be
staggeringly original, exhausting, and
replete. If his comment was a quick
pun to Koestler’s “Ghost in the
Machine,” the European intellectual
par eminence is too absorbed to notice
it. Perhaps he has doubts about Aus-
tralia already.
A young reporter at the Press con-
ference on the previous afternoon had
accused him of once being a Nazi
after becoming confused about the
terms Social Democrat and National
Socialist.
Another young man had stood with
a bottle of beer in his hand suggesting
that Koestler’s comments about the
terrifying capacity of Man to destroy
his own species contradicted Freud.
This man, too, had been a little con-
fused. The word biological and psycho-
logical caused him some trouble.
Koestler is alert to everything
around him. He worries about con-
tinuity and camera angles. But Jones
says not to worry.
Jones begins his questions with the
theme of Koestler as a younger man
searching for Utopias. Was his father
a Utopian figure and was Israel a
Utopia? The questions go on quickly
and at times Koestler is irritated by this
stress on his past. “I repeat to you,” he
says, “I left Palestine when the State
had been established.”
He explains again that he was a
Zionist until the choice had to be made
between being an Israeli and a Euro-
pean. He could not choose to be both.
Europe was his cultural heritage, his
home, his language.
Koestler talks of the brilliant mili-
tant Zionist Jabotinsky and of the “blue-
eyed idealist” Willi Munzenberg, who,
as head of Communist agitation and
propaganda in Western Europe and
Germany, invented the front method
“in all innocence” because he believed
it.
The concentration on his political
past is starting to annoy him. They
take a break and he announces quietly
that he is not happy. It is not what
he expected. It is unpleasant to drag
up Munzenberg again, who was found
hanging from a tree with his face
bashed in when he defected from the
Party.
Mrs. Koestler, Hector Crawford, the
tactful Westerway and Jones talk him
round and remind him that the past is
a necessary foundation for what is to
follow. “You spoke before of English
and Australian innocence,” says Jones.
“That is exactly the right word. Aus-
tralia is a country of amazing banality
and innocence.”
“But who is interested in this past?”
says Koestler. “For me it is dead.”
“I am interested,” retorts Jones.
Koestler satisfied, they return to
taping. He explains the attractions of
Communism during the Depression
years; the infallibility of the closed-
circuit system of the Communist
dialectic, which could explain away
everything, doubts, facts, and all; how
almost every writer went over: Gide,
Auden, Isherwood, Spender, Silone,
Steinbeck; how it felt to be waiting for
execution.
They touch on the time when
Koestler, as a young journalist, inter-
viewed Freud. “I felt like a very small
boy. I expected him to have the secrets
of the universe in his hands, but he had
nothing to give me.”
“Tell us about your escape from
North Africa to England.”
“It is irrelevant,” says Koestler. “It
is irrelevant because these things hap-
pened to tens of thousands of Euro-
peans. Mine is only one story. What
does it matter if I grew a moustache
down to here? So, so many had these
experiences. That is why it is not
important what boat I took.”

Refugee from the grocery revolution
By D. J. HISLOP
SO YOU HAVE worked 15 years with
one company and now you are resigning
to go to another job. Looking back
over those years, looking forward, try-
ing to see into the years to come, how
do you feel about it all? That was the
question I had to ask myself when I
decided to walk out on the position I
had held all those long years as branch
accountant of a national food-marketing
company.
It seemed to me quite an important
decision to make. I was 55 years of
age and very much aware that, in the
eyes of most employers seeking new
staff, anybody over the age of 35 was
a dead loss. If I stayed there, in that
same position, I should almost cer-
tainly have security in employment
until the day I retired, probably ten
years farther along the line. The com-
pany had grown tremendously while I
had been with it, largely due to two
takeovers, one a takeover of the original
Australian company six years earlier by
a high-pressure foreign food-marketing
concern, the second the takeover quite
recently of another flourishing Austra-
lian company of comparable size with
the original organisation.
When I accepted employment in that
company, just over 15 years ago, it was
moving along quietly, increasing turn-
over annually, turning in regular profit
figures. In the fairly common Australian
pattern of those days, no one looked
like going crazy from overwork. Store
and factory staffs worked overtime now
and again, but the office staff, with the
exception of the manager on occasions,
worked no overtime whatsoever.
They were easy-going days—this was
in 1953—the booming days of the super-
market, the chain grocery stores, the
bulk-buying groups of storekeepers
banding together to fight the competi-
tion of more powerful opposition had
not yet come. The grocery world, like
so many other spheres of commerce,
apparently had not quite sorted itself
out after the impact of World War 11,
at least as far as shaping up to the
future was concerned.
Most local wholesale-marketing firms
were jogging along in the quiet, sober
pattern of pre-war days. The big whole-
sale merchants, who handled anything
and everything, still accounted for a lot
of the distribution of the company’s
products. Manufacturers were not yet
going direct to the retail man with
the relentless drive that was soon to
come. Though the operations of a few
of the local companies were being
guided by foreign owners, most of
them still lived with the accounting
systems, the marketing systems, the
administrative systems of yesterday.
They took out monthly figures to show
the value of sales for the period, the
total of expenses, and the difference
was roughly profit or loss.
In those days, there still seemed to
be a little shop every few yards along
a street and on every street corner. It
was the day of the individual trader.
There were a few chainstores, but not
many, and, in any case, there were
not usually many links in the chain. We
had a lot more accounts to supervise
than we were to have 15 years later,
when a dozen or so big groups were
buying something like 90 percent of
the goods we sold. The small traders
were often careless with their payments,
and overdue accounts were not altogether
uncommon, but so long as they were
within the 60- to 90-day bracket we
w r ere not unduly concerned.
With the motor industry still finding
its feet after the strictly controlled
production days of the war years, car
ownership was not nearly as common
as it is today. Without the supermarkets,
the big chains spreading into every
district, without the means to go to
town quickly and reasonably economi-
cally by means of the family car, the
housewife usually relied on the shop
nearest her home, or, if she didn’t like
the shopkeeper or his prices, she could
easily find another shop within easy
reach in the same locality.
To many men, storekeeping seemed
an easy way of earning a living, but
many of the storekeepers of those days
flourished only as long as the easy days
lasted. When the chainstores, the
groups, the supermarkets began to creep
on to the local scene, many of those
small businesses folded up more or less
automatically.
Small stores were soon to be more
of a nuisance than a useful selling out-
let, not worthy of the attention of the
go-getter marketing organisations,
strengthened with the know-how,
charged with the drive that for years
had proved successful in overseas mar-
kets. In the space of a few years, the
whole pattern of food marketing in
Australia was to change dramatically.
But the grocery world was a com-
paratively orderly world when I first
entered. We used to start work at nine
a.m., have an hour for lunch, and leave
the office regularly at five p.m. with
the comforting knowledge that all work
was as up to date as necessary. We
even received quite good bonuses at
Christmastime, and had occasional
leisurely trips interstate to head office
to spend a certain amount of time round
the conference table, a certain amount
in the pleasant enough occupation of
getting to know each other without hav-
ing to cram vital money-making con-
versation into every minute of the trip,
and a certain amount in social relaxa-
tion after conference hours. There was
never any danger of having to work
back or take work home consistently on
a public holiday or weekend. With due
regard to the desires of other staff mem-
bers, we could take annual leave when
we chose and know that we were not
going to have a crazy battle to get all
work up to date again in the shortest
possible time when the holiday was
over.
Despite the accent on an orderly
way of life, the absence of undue stress
and high-pressure methods, I believe I
earned my money in those days just
as thoroughly as I was to earn it in the
years that followed, the years that were
to see the takeover of the company
by an overseas concern and the intro-
duction of up-to-the-minute high-
pressure production, marketing, and
accounting methods that were to shatter
the pre-takeover routine existence.
In the days when I joined the com-
pany, commercial travellers, the sales
representatives of today, collected what
orders they could, what outstanding
accounts they could, put in a couple of
appearances at the office during the
week, relaxed round a sales-conference
table on Friday afternoon, and then
went out for a few beers to wind up
the relaxing process.
Today, the life of the sales represen-
tative, at least in most of the taken-over
firms, is a much more exacting one.
Many reps are told what quantities of
individual lines they are expected to sell
to individual buyers over a period, and
their job may easily swing on the
success or otherwise of their efforts in
this direction.
Today, in most high-pressure market-
ing concerns, the demand is for statis-
tics, figures, figures, and more figures,
quarterly, weekly, and daily figures,
each and every one of them as accurate
as can be —figures added, subtracted,
dissected, multiplied, made into per-
centages, compared with last year’s
figures, last quarter’s, last week’s figures.
They must always be completely up to
date, produced as soon as possible after
completion of the process under review.
They must be in the hands outstretched
waiting to grab them just as soon as is
physically possible after completion.
Usually a tremendous amount of
work is involved in taking out figures
required, supplying details of sales in
dozens and dollar value for each signifi-
cant product handled, breaking sales
up into categories covering each pur-
chase so that it is possible to see the
number of dozens and dollar value of
any specific commodity sold to any
individual client in any one week, and
set these figures against budgeted sales
for the same period, to estimate per-

centage achieved against the 100 per-
cent demanded.
The ever-present demand for immedi-
ate figures, for sales according to
budget, and all those other demands
created by these two factors—that, I
believe, is the major difference between
today’s high-pressure world of com-
merce, particularly in the grocery field,
and the same field that I first knew
back in 1953.
A by-product of these conditions was
the main reason why I decided to leave
the company that had employed me
over those 15 years. To many people
the reason might seem of slight conse-
quence, but, for the past three years
that I was employed by the company, I
had been trying to get at least one two-
week break and I had been unable to
do it. I had told my family more than
once that I expected to be able to take
a fortnight’s break, get away some-
where next school holidays or at some
convenient time, and ,then, when that
time had come, there had always been
urgent work to be done, budgeting for
future occasions, analysis of figures,
introduction of new systems, reluctance
to leave work with inexperienced staff,
something, some detailed work required
immediately—always had the proposed
two-week break come back to one week,
with family disappointments, the grow-
ing sense of frustration at being unable
to make the complete break, even for
so short a time, to forget for a little
while the frenzied world of figures
and revive flagging spirits that certainly
needed reviving.
On the day that I resigned I spoke
by phone with three senior staff of our
head office on the other side of Aus-
tralia. They all seemed to think there
was something abnormal in my resign-
ing. I suppose they could hardly be
blamed for failing to appreciate the
full significance behind the apparently
simple reason for my resigning. I
believe there was no doubt that I could
have stayed with the company for at
least ten years more, until I reached
retiring age, financially secure on quite
a reasonable salary, with annual bonus
and superannuation, at a location in a
modern office less than five minutes’
drive from my home.
Perhaps, in a world where protests
are not altogether rare, my gesture was,
as much as anything, my protest, my
protest at the unreasonable inroads
being made on my private life largely
for the sake of foreign investors and
the men at the top of the organisation,
who stood to benefit most in glory and
wealth from the success of the company.
No doubt, to many my action must
appear a crazy one, crazy at least in
the eyes of a high-pressure world where
the dollar, each additional dollar that
can be pushed on to the annual profit,
is of vital importance—and a complete
break for at least a fortnight’s holiday
a year to each and every employee
is simply one of those things you can
have if you are lucky, but which you
may, unfortunately, miss out on if you
are not.

WHO TAKES OVER WHO?
SINCE IT IS becoming increasingly
fashionable to deplore takeover bids for
Australian companies by overseas in-
terests, Mr. Rupert Murdoch’s battle
for the British “News of the World”
yet to be fought—might, at first sight,
have seemed a pleasant reversal of the
procedure. But who is taking over who?
If Mr. Murdoch wins, he hands over
to Sir William Carr, chairman of “News
of the World,” a package of his more
successful Australian enterprises which
will be showing pre-tax profits in the
region of $2 million. It is true that in
return Mr. Murdoch’s company will
receive a 40 percent interest the
largest single holding in an enlarged
“News of the World” and Mr. Murdoch
himself will get the managing-director-
ship of the company, but whichever
way you look at it and whatever the
formal agreements between Mr. Mur-
doch and Sir William Carr may be, a
package of Australian magazines and
newspapers will have come under
British control, and so, too, could Mr.
Murdoch.
The last point depends on Mr. Mur-
doch’s attitudes toward the British: the
hid, if successful, could turn out to
be more of a British takeover than an
Australian one. Mr. Murdoch’s perform-
ances in London during the initial
skirmishes were about as anglophile as
Yorkshire pudding. It was fairly
obvious that they had to be, since one of
Sir William Carr’s ploys to thwart the
Initial takeover bid for “News of the
World” from Mr. Robert Maxwell of
Pergamon Press was a nationalistic
appeal that the “News of the World”
was “as British as roast beef” a
very dubious claim whereas Mr.
Maxwell, though a nationalised English-
man who won an MC in the war, was
born a Czech. Sir William has made
no bones about his feelings of personal
enmity for Mr. Maxwell.
Mr. Murdoch proceeded to bend over
backward to prove his love of the
country whose largest-sale newspaper he
was trying to take over. Confronted
with accusations of being anti-British
by the “Financial Times” he dismissed
them as “a bit rough” and talked rather
of the millions of British migrants in
Australia and the large numbers of
British journalists working on his
papers: “We were among the first
papers to recognise the interest in
things British and put in sporting
results and other things which others
have not done. Rather than be anti-
British I’m always admiring the
British.” In terms of politics and with-
drawals from east of Suez and invest-
ment restrictions, Mr. Murdoch said
he was unaware of any criticism
through his papers “and there will be
Rupert Murdoch, of News Ltd.
none” ... “I think Britain has to look
after itself and Australia after itself.”
But if the bid comes off and when the
self-interests conflict it will be interest-
ing to see what editorial policies Mr.
Murdoch follows. There could be times
when British and Australian interests
might clearly differ.
Britain has traditional means of deal-
ing with those of its Press barons who
arrive from overseas. Their Lordships,
be they a Beaverbrook or a Thomson,
did not ascend to that noble House for
the contributions they could make to
its erudite debates. Perhaps Mr. Mur-
doch’s aspirations do not rise that high.
He is, none the less, seen as “an Oxford
graduate with long and sentimental ties
with a country he cherishes, knows,
and understands,” as the “Financial
Times” put it. And here was a man
who, according to Fleet Street, des-
cended into the deepest mud of the
City and while comrades-in-arms tended
to founder on either side, emerged
without a blemish, a little naive, per-
haps, but charmingly so, one who didn’t
mind appearing “bloody ignorant”
about the facts and figures of News Ltd.
and whose watercress sandwiches and
gins with very liberal tonic became a
feature of the financial Press. In his
performance Mr. Murdoch won over
the City Press and, so the Carrs’ hope,
the shareholders of the “News of the
World.” But how the shareholders of
News Ltd. back in Australia feel about
all this depends on who they reckon is
duping who.
The alarums and excursions which
lasted for a month and brought the
threatening figure of the President of
the Board of Trade to the gates of
a somewhat alarmed City of London
was only the preliminary show of arms.
The battle for the “News of the World”
has yet to be fought at an extraor-
dinary shareholders’ meeting to be
railed just as soon as Mr. Murdoch has
his bid sorted out. What happened
during that month in share dealings to
block Mr. Maxwell’s original bid was
so blatantly against the spirit of the
City’s takeover code that the City, in
an attempt to save itself from bureau-
cratic thumb-screws, took the affair
back to square one by freezing the votes
attached to the shares purchased by the
warring parties since the Pergamon
takeover bid on October 16. On the
one hand this eliminated the 3.5 per-
cent holding bought by Morgan Gren-
fell for Mr. Murdoch plus the 10.5
percent of N.o.W.’s merchant bankers,
Hambros, and on the other 0.2 per-
cent bought by Hill Samuel for Mr.
Maxwell. In the ring at the extra-
ordinary meeting will be the Carr
family holding 32 percent with Mr.
Murdoch standing by, and Mr. Max-
well with the 27 percent of Professor
Jackson, a 62-year-old six-times married
scientist and a breakaway from the
Carr family circle. The outstanding 27
percent will determine the winner.
Knock off five percent for the votes
that never will get cast and that leaves
Mr. Maxwell in need of a 14 percent
gain to win the day, and the old firm
led by Sir William Carr and his son
Clive in need of a nine percent gain.
Mr. Maxwell still has a sporting
chance.
By and large, everything depends on
Mr. Murdoch coming up with a worth-
while proposal which will support the
shares on the market at the 50s. Mr.
Maxwell is offering for them. Hopeful,
medium-term prospects are not enough.
But, at least on the crude basis of
market valuations, Mr. Murdoch will
find this impossible. Mr. Maxwell’s bid
put up a price of £3O million. To
match this, the proposed enlarged
Carr-Murdoch faction must be worth
£44 million. Before the Maxwell bid
N.o.W. was valued at £20.5 million
and News Ltd. is currently valued at
roughly another £2O million. Making
the credibility gap even wider is Mr.
Murdoch’s apparent intention of inject-
ing into N.o.W. something like only a
third of News’ pre-tax profit.
Such considerations won’t, of course,
repel all the floating votes though,
ironically, some of the Carr family
holding controlled by trustees will have
to turn against the family under such
circumstances. Others, with a strong
attachment to “their” paper, may not
want to see a Labor Member of Parlia-
ment like Mr. Maxwell even though


SEAROAD GOES
INTERNATIONAL
(and A.N.L. adds 10,000 miles to its
Unitised Cargo Services)
In 1959 A.N.L.'s pioneering Searoad Service linked Mel-
bourne and northern Tasmania, a distance of 230 miles.
In 1969, A.N.L. Searoad ships will be operating
over a total of 10,000 miles, from Hobart northward to the
Ports of Brisbane, Mackay, Rockhampton, Townsville
and Cairns, and including the new Eastern Searoad
Service to Japan.
Maritime history will be made with the introduc-
tion of this first Australia-Japan joint shipping service.
Operated by The Australian National Line (A.N.L.) and
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line) of Japan, the new inter-
national searoad service will combine the safety and
simplicity of modern sea transport with the flexibility
and versatility of the road carrier. Containers, cars, unit
loads of all descriptions the new service will carry
them all.
Two new, specialised, 21 knot, 12,000 ton vehicle
deck-container ships will maintain a fortnightly cargo
schedule.
This will be the first regular overseas service
operated by an Australian line for nearly 40 years.
Ten years ago, A.N.L. pioneered the Searoad
method of shipment across Bass Strait and introduced
many of the cargo handling techniques which have
since revitalised the nation’s shipping industry.
And now, A.N.L. is making ready to launch the
most modern and efficient shipping service ever to link
Australia and Japan.
You may never make a landfall for-Yokkaichi,
Nagoya, Yokohama or Kobe. Yet this is all very much
your business because The Australian National Line is
the Commonwealth’s own shipping organisation.
At the close of another successful year’s opera-
tions and on the threshold of one that promises to be the
most significant in Australia's maritime history, The
Australian National Line reports its achievements since
its establishment 11 years ago:—
AS AT 30TH JUNE, 1968,
THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE HAS:-
Added 18 new ships to the fleet.
Invested $6B million in new tonnage.
Raised its fixed assets to over $93 million.
Paid (or made provision for) $26 million
in Income Tax.
Paid (or made provision for) $22 million
in way of Dividends.
Paid over $96 million in wages and salaries.

he has promised no editorial inter-
ference take over a paper which
has for so long been the stamping
ground of some pretty outspoken Right-
wingers.
Mr. Murdoch’s exercise in anglo-
philia is obviously going to stand him
in some good stead, but it is going to
take something more than a fresh,
sun-tanned image to win the City over
in its professional role. Should his bid
be successful, his assessment of his
potential at the wheel of N.o.W. will be
marked into share prices accordingly.
An assessment of just how big this
potential is will be an important factor
in deciding the final outcome.
Mr. Murdoch’s most persistent claim
is that he is a publisher of newspapers
and that the future of the N.o.W.
holdings is the future of the “News of
the World.” He claims that Mr. Max-
well has no experience in. this, that there
is no marriage between interests in
learned scientific publications and the
“News of the World.” But N.o.W. is far
from being just a newspaper. It has
printing and paper, transport and engin-
eering interests, a chemical company
and a golf course. Mr. Murdoch’s
attitude to this industrial side is that
you take a close look at the components,
if they seem worthwhile you keep them
and if they appear to be a drag on
the operations you get rid of them. The
newspaper accounts for less than, half
of the company’s current profits.
Although Mr. Maxwell’s only experi-
ence of newspapers was in immediate
post-war Germany, that at least should
guarantee that for the moment the
“News of the World” will be left alone
to go on being the paper with the
world’s largest circulation. This, despite
a rise in price from 6d to 7d, still
remains above the 6 million, mark.
If Mr. Murdoch sees himself as a
Press baron, Mr. Maxwell, having tem-
porarily put aside aspirations toward
Mr. Wilson’s Cabinet, sees himself
relative to the printing industry rather
like Arnold Weinstock is to electricals,
a supermanager. He has set his sights
specifically on N.o.W.’s massive £lO
million coated paper plant and
the £8 million gravure printing works
of Eric Bemrose, both at present
gobbling up the profits through excess
capacity. Pergamon buys about £2 mil-
lion in paper and £750,000 in print
from overseas each year. The conclu-
sion is inevitable. Cut imports and
increase export potential says Mr. Max-
well. It is certainly a suggestion which
must appeal to the British spirit of the
moment. One knotty problem is that
Pergamon handles hardly any gravure
work. But up his sleeve Mr. Maxwell
has what he calls “plans for a closed
circulation magazine in partnership with
a major national organisation with
access to every home in the land.”
Paradoxically, the picture of indus-
trial integration and doubling profits
which Mr. Maxwell is ready to paint
fits strangely well into the same vision
that Sir William Carr has been pursu-
ing over the past ten years by diversi-
fying away from the 125-year-old news-
paper. But the assumption is that Mr.
Maxwell would do it better. In the
process of Sir William’s changes the
company showed a quite awful record.
In 1961 it made a good fat 32 percent
on capital employed; since then there
has been a steady decline to 12.5 percent
last year. The assets of the company
have trebled, and it is almost up to its
nose in debt with the close of last year
showing an overdraft of £4.5 million
and debenture of £6 million, repre-
senting about half of the capital
employed. Profits took a turn for the
better in the first six months of this year
and are forecast at £2.5 million for the
full year. But anything could happen
after that: the transport division is
threatened by a forthcoming Transport
Bill; devaluation has covered the maga-
zine side with pessimism; under-capacity
haunts the massive gravure printing
works and paper subsidiary, and the
presses of the “News of the World”
itself. Should Carr-Murdoch win the
battle there could be some further fire-
works ahead if Mr. Murdoch unloads
some of Sir William’s diversifications.
For his final appeal to the City, Mr.
Murdoch had this to say about the
management skills he has to offer
N.0.W.: “It is hard to define what is
expertise in newspaper management. All
one can talk about is record. In, terms
of record all I can put up is being able
to take a small company making a small
profit over a period of ten years, mak-
ing it, by Australian standards, a big
company, and producing considerable
profits.” London has been fascinated
by the, Murdoch success story, but it is
also something of a British legend how
Robert Maxwell, who in 1951 bought
the tiny Pergamon Press for £13,000,
built it up into a company which the
stock market values today at £3O
million. However, there is no doubt that
Mr. Murdoch has shown a high degree
of newspaper and business ability and
that his building up of News Ltd. has
been quite an achievement.
All these matters will play a part in
the final outcome of the battle. But of
prime concern for the floating share-
holders of N.o.W. and the small Aus-
tralian shareholders who have some
50 percent of News Ltd. is just what
Mr. Murdoch is going to hand over to
Sir William Carr.
In 1958 the interests of News Ltd.
were confined chiefly to publication of
the “News” and the “Sunday Mail” in
Adelaide, the “Sunday Times” in Perth,
the “New Idea,” a national weekly
magazine for women, a new magazine
“TV Week,” “The Barrier Miner,” in
Broken Hill, the “West Wimmera
Mail,” in Horsham (Vic.), plus inter-
ests in radio 2BH (Broken Hill) and
SDN, and the genesis of its TV inter-
ests, with successful application for one
of the two first Adelaide commercial
TV stations by its offspring, Southern
Television Corporation Ltd.
Today, it has a national daily, the
“Australian,” the Sydney afternoon
paper the “Daily Mirror,” and its
Sunday associate the “Sunday Mirror,”

the weeklies the Sunday “Truth” in
Brisbane and “Truth” in Melbourne,
and “Sportsman” in Sydney, two papers
in the Northern Territory, as well as
its original papers in Adelaide and
Perth. In all, there are 14 newspapers
owned by the group, and associated
interests in the “Sunday Mail” and
the “Dominion” and “Sunday Times”
in New Zealand.
It owns 12 magazines, nine trade
journals, has four commercial printeries,
seven photo-engravers and platemakers,
seven radio and TV interests, three book
publishers, a commercial typesetter,
nine country newspapers, 21 suburban
give-aways in Sydney, four in Brisbane,
and four in Melbourne, and claims the
fastest-growing recording business in
Australia, Festival Records.
The 1967 accounts (but not 1968)
showed rough graphs of revenue and
profits by various divisions, in which
the daily newspapers, and the weekly
and other newspapers, earned the lion’s
share of revenue, but the dailies earn
very little of group net profit. The
weekly and other newspapers, and the
TV, radio, records, and miscellaneous
were the big profit earners.
Mr. Murdoch has announced that he
would exchange less than 50 percent of
News’s assets (which totalled $41.9
million in 1968) for his 40 percent
interest in N.o.W. He has said these
would be certain of News’s publishing
enterprises, and obviously not the
“Australian” or the “Daily Mirror,” as
these make nothing yet. Transfer of
any of the TV or radio interests would
be improbable. Government legislation
is in process to bring conditions of
ownership of radio stations into line
with TV, and this will be retrospective
to the date when this was originated.
Not more than 15 percent of the issued
capital of a company holding a TV
licence shall be beneficially owned by a
company controlled by persons who arc
not residents of Australia.
Whatever the package eventually
presented to the shareholders of N.0.W.,
the shareholders of News Ltd. are
probably going to be presented with a
fait accompli. The British financial
Press has set itself up as the guardian
of the small shareholder; just how
efficient they are at their self-appointed
job was more than adequately demon-
strated during the initial skirmishes in
the N.o.W. affair. Their cries of out-
rage at the way Carr-Murdoch et al.
steamrolled across the shareholders
shook the City, roused the Govern-
ment, and finally reinstated the small
shareholders to make the final choice.
Shareholders in Australia have no such
guardian in London to depend upon.
They might, above all, object to so
much of their assets being transferred
to London at such a time of inter-
national monetary crisis when money
is fleeing the City to Australia rather
than the reverse. They would be swop-
ping Australian assets for English
money. And they might object to Mr.
Murdoch, the undoubted life and soul
of the company, installing himself
12,000 miles away for a significant part
of the year. They might even object
to this or that magazine or paper com-
ing under foreign control. But they
are unlikely to have any say in the
matter. The Murdoch family still con-
trol a good 38 percent of the company,
the American Broadcasting Corpora-
tion has a 5.5 percent stake and
Associated Newspapers of England
chaired by Lord Rothermere and
owners of the “Daily Mail” a further
five percent.
The Australian Government is, how-
ever, quite likely to come up with a
few words of criticism. It, for one, is
unlikely to react kindly to the transfer
of ownership of any Australian news-
paper to overseas interests. Perhaps it
could be argued that the Brisbane
“Truth” and the Melbourne “Truth”
are not vital to the national interest and
would fit well into the Augean stable
of the “News of the World.” But this
is not allowing for possible changes in
them. They are newspapers.
Nor is the position on transferring
assets to London at all clear. Mr. Mur-
doch is confident of gaining the consent
of the Reserve Bank for his plan. Yet
the Reserve Bank, as the instrument of
Treasury’s Exchange Control, is seem-
ingly unable to state a firm policy on
exchange of Australian, assets for shares
in a foreign company. Every case is
said to be judged on its merits, but how
those merits are assessed is determined
from time to time according to the
Government’s mood of the moment.
The precarious state of the British
economy could well weigh heavily on
that at present and for some time to
come.
There are, of course, ways around
even Reserve Bank decisions. When, the
Treasury turned down TNT’s plan to
sell out for shares in Britain’s Trans-
port Development Group, the decision
was circumvented by a reverse takeover
in which TNT took over TDG’s Aus-
tralian assets and gave TDG 32 percent
equity interest in TNT. As far as Mr.
Murdoch is concerned, News and
N.o.W. might, if the worst comes to the
worst, form an Australian holding com-
pany in which to vest the transferable
assets, so following the letter of the law
but evading its spirit. That sort of
legal trickery was at the heart of the
London storm over N.o.W. But with
a nationalistic Australian Prime
Minister operating flexible Government
policies it could well become the heart
of as grpat a storm in Australia. An,d
it would still leave the News Ltd.
shareholders with a large part of their
profit to come in the form of an
uncertain English currency from a
problem English company.
Whichever way it goes, the N.o.W.
shareholders are going to be better off.
If Mr. Maxwell takes over, they get
their cash. If Mr. Murdoch takes over,
they get someone who is certainly a
good newspaper man and they
couldn’t be worse off than they are
now. The only people who can lose
are the shareholders of News Ltd., and
the Australian community, if some of its
newspapers become overseas-controlled.

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Why a $3 million fire barely rated a mention
Felt and Textiles after the fire...not a tragedy, simply as $ 3 million debit on the books of insurance underwriters.
TIRES, EVEN BUSH FIRES, are acts
of carelessness or stupidity or malice,
even insanity, but they are not acts
of God. The fire insurance underwriters
pay up accordingly. As the cost of fire
losses persistently escalates a record
of about $9B million last year, more
this year and, following the relentless
trend, $5OO million by the turn of the
century regular threats of higher
premiums are issued.
As fires swept the environs of Sydney
last week, two people were burnt alive,
three firefighters died of heart attacks,
several hundred houses were consumed,
and countless acres of bush were
blackened. The Government and the
nation were moved to pity. A couple
of days earlier the premises of Felt
and Textiles Industries in S' dn,ey was
gutted. This was not a tragedy, simply
a debit item for something more than
$3 million on the underwriters’ balance
sheets, a figure considerably more than
will be entered for the several hundred
houses.
For the fire insurance underwriters
it is, despite everything, still good
business. Last year they received $91.1
million in premiums for direct fire
insurance and payed out $36.6 million
in claims. Under householders’ com-
prehensive they received SIeL7 million
and payed out $13.6 million. There are
substantial administration costs to be
met and last year a $l6 million con-
tribution was made toward the upkeep
of the fire brigades.
Part of the administration costs
involve a survey staff of about 20
people organised by the Fire and
Accident Underwriters’ Association to
advise companies as to what should be
done to minimise fire risks. Their
potential powers are considerable in
the economic sanctions they could
recommend. Selective and heavy in-
creases in fire insurance premiums
could be applied. The association points
out that cuts in premiums of up to 50
percent may be given if an efficient
sprinkler system is installed. But there
is little effort made to keep a check
on whether the sprinklers or the alarms
or the other fire-protection equipment
are kept in working order. Such
sanctions are next to useless if this is
the case. And the insurance companies
have yet to use their powers to influence
the industrial architects. Open plan
designs may have many advantages,
but they increase the fire-damage risk
considerably. Little attention is paid
to the fire risk involved when selecting
industrial building materials.
Overall, the insurance companies
seem to show little inclination to use
their powers of selective sanction, per-
haps because fire insurance still remains
the most rewarding section of the
business. But the rate of increase in
fire claims is already faster than that
of premiums. And since the insurance
companies have stated that of the $5OO
million losses estimated for the year
2000, 98 percent will occur in un-
sprinklered premises, then it should
not be too long before they put two
and two together and try to use their
powers of fire prevention to their full
effect.
The legislation with regard to fire
prevention is puny, indeed. It is easy
enough for the Government to feel
sorry after the event. It is not all that
difficult to legislate against the
chronic fire hazards that exist
throughout industry and commerce,
and make the penalties for offences
faintly comensurate, at least, with the
human risks and the massive loss of
property involved. As things stand the
fire brigades have powers to advise the
Chief Secretary on what should be
done in theatres, cinemas, and public
halls; they may be called on to advise
also on fire escapes throughout industry
and commerce, but they have no
powers whatsoever to recommend, let
alone require, what fire precautions or
fire-fighting equipment should be in-
stalled. In the case of hospitals and
many other buildings they have no
rights to recommend, inspect, or even
enter.
Fires usually start through careless-
ness and negligence. And the same
carelessness and negligence can equally
lead to fire-fighting equipment not
being there, fire exits not being usable,
employees not being given fire-drill
practice and so on. Last year’s loss of
S9B million seems to have left little
impression. Perhaps, when, as hap-
pened in Glasgow a couple of weeks
ago, 22 people were seen to be burnt to
death behind the iron-barred windows


of an antiquated factory whose fire
escape doors just happened not to open,
or several hundred die in a rambling
old department store fire, as in
Brussels last year, something will be
done about things here, too. In the
meantime expressions of pity and con-
tributions to public sympathy funds
are having to suffice.
MEN AND MATTERS
THE ONUS OF PUSHING Australian
management expertise on to loftier
ground rests almost exclusively on the
shoulders of private endeavors in this
country. For those who operate as
management consultants the field is
wide open for lucrative rewards, not
only for those who elect (as many do)
to take on top managerial jobs in con-
cerns that originally call them in only
to advise but also for those who stay
in the profession simply as consultants.
If you are a consultant of the calibre,
say, of Jack Smith, the managing
director of the Australian leg of the
world orientated PA management con-
sultants, you find also that the world
becomes your oyster, too, because the
language of management is an inter-
national one, the techniques of manage-
ment know no frontiers, and, in the case
of PA, your firm has nests in many
lands.
Mr. Smith is about the same vintage
as Sir Henry Bolte, who was at Ballarat
College with him in the old days, and
came into the management game by the
back door, so to speak. As a graduate
In mining engineering from the Univer-
sity of Melbourne he hopped across to
New Guinea, where he stayed three
years (until 1941) with an oil explora-
Jack Smith
lan Murray
tion outfit and just managed to get
out before the Japs managed to get in.
Still a long way from the plush office
in Queens Road, his next berth was
with the Melbourne Metropolitan Board
of Works on dam projects in the Yarra
Valley. His first formal step into
management circles was when he joined
PA in 1948 and, being recognised
as a bright boy, was sent off to Britain
to learn the consultants’ trade, return-
ing in 1951 to the staff of twelve in
Melbourne. By 1958 he was joint
managing director; then, six years later,
he became the sole one with, today, a
staff of 120 consultants at his com-
mand and himself also a member of
PA’s international board.
Like so many of his fellow profes-
sionals when he returns here from rov-
ing around the world, as he is wont
Uo do from time to time in search
of elusive management mystiques, Mr.
Smith is rather inclined to tell our
business grandmothers to suck eggs.
But his criticisms are invariably sin-
cere and well meant, even if the
anecdotes, say about what the Swedes
or the Romans do to whip up export
business, although to the point, some-
times grate on Australian ears. For all
that, he has few, if any, peers in the
management consultancy field here and
is master of all he surveys in it.
PROBABLY IT’S JUST a coincidence,
although an interesting fact to know,
that many of the “young Turks” at
Slater, Walker’s London office are
particularly keen chess players—with
their chief, Jim Slater, playing a notice-
ably high-standard game. Many of the
group’s takeover accessions (victims,
if you will) may very well feel that
their conquerors show every evidence of
being trained'in the background skills
possessed traditionally by Russian Army
officers, whose moves are apparently
sharpened by finesse on the chessboard.
But what is one to make of the
knowledge that Slater, Walker Aus-
tralia’s new managing director, Mr.
lan Murray, is an expert and enthus-
iastic trout fisherman? Of course,
there won’t be those lacking to say
that the latest operation in Drug
Houses of Australia was fishing in very
troubled waters indeed. The tricky
casts employed in this situation are
still strange and dubious to many local
financial men. Yet Slaters stand by the
efficacy of their methods and fully
realise that they must honestly fulfil
their various estimates and their
programs.
A good deal of lan Murray’s time
will be given to reorganising, restruc-
turing, and rationalising the variety of
enterprises which fall into Slater,
Walker’s maw. He’s especially proud
of his trouble-shooting capacity, relat-
ing with gusto a host of experience
crammed into a youthful-looking 34
years. Born in Sydney, lan graduated
in civil engineering at Adelaide Uni-
versity, and took the first steps in
management consultancy with PA
Management in Australia. Hieing off
to London after his marriage, the U.K.
PA organisation provided him with a
tremendous diversity of industrial
surgery to perform. There’s been no
practising of engineering in the strict
sense, but the analytical approach of
the trained engineer is quite apparent.
Added to all this is a quite formidable
relish for the financial cut-and-thrust,
so it’s not surprising to hear of the
move to the flourishing Slater, Walker
about a year and a half ago.
It will doubtless be the fate of more
of the less-lively Australian companies
to be gathered by the Slater, Walker
clutch. lan Murray is looking forward
to furnishing them, then, with a lively
response. J
INDONESIA
METALS BONANZA
PERHAPS MR. GORTON has a point
in implying that overseas investors in
minerals are a pretty determined lot
not easily dissuaded. How else is the
current rush to Indonesia explained?
Since General Suharto opened the coun-
try to foreign investors 18 months ago,
something like $3OO million investment
capital has been promised by 75 differ-
ent companies; and all that, despite
galloping inflation at between 3 and 5
percent a month, severe shortages of
industrial necessities, crippling import
taxes, and largely unusable lines of
communication. Only President Sukarno
seems to have-been too much of a bad
thing.
For the foreign investor, Indonesia,
apart from being an obvious nightmare,
is also a substantial challenge. A mere
5 percent of its 735,000 square miles
have so far been geologically surveyed;
rich deposits of tin, nickel, and bauxite
have been turned up and are beings
mined; and it is obvious enough that
with 17 oil companies and four mining
giants infected with prospecting fever,
there is a great deal more going to be
found.
Copper and nickel are the current
favorites. Freeport Sulphur of the U.S.,
the first mining company to receive a
contract under the new regime, has
already spent about $1.5 million in
exploring the unknown forest of West
Irian in search of copper, and has come
up with some promising structures on
which the company is prophesying it
will spend some $B2 million over the
next six years.
Sulawesi, between West Irian and
Borneo, has been the scene of some fierce
competition and mud slinging over
nickel prospects. Contestants in that
particular field included two companies
from Japan, one from Holland, one
from Indonesia itself, a consortium com-
prising Kaiser Aluminium and Le
Nickel, and the International Nickel
Company of Canada. Bids, counter-bids,
secret consultations, and ambassadorial
intrigues resulted in INCO emerging as
the winner, with predictions of spending
another $B2 million there over the next
few years. Nickel deposits in West
Irian are the objects of current negotia-
tions in which such companies as Pacific
Nickel, U.S. Steel, Newmont Mining,
and Sherritt Gordon have interests.
But tin is still potentially one of
Indonesia’s richest resources. Rio Tinto-
Zinc, together with Bethlehem Steel, is

now negotiating a tin-mining project
in the Riau Islands, near Singapore,
while the Dutch company Billiton has
just clinched a deal for off-shore tin
mining around the Bangka and Karim-
ata Island, to the south-east, and is
talking about an $B-million investment.
It all sounds quite a bonanza for
Indonesia. Under the new mining laws,
substantial tax relief for as much as
ten years is available for companies
operating in “difficult areas.” But taxes
can be very high, indeed. INCO, for
example, will be paying 37.5 percent
over the first ten years, then 45 percent,
returning the entire mining operation
to the Indonesian Government after 30
years. This is a standard contract and
has already frightened some foreign
investors away completely. It would
seem that even the lust for minerals
has its price, which is a point the Aus-
tralian Government could well keep in
mind while considering just how far
overseas investors can be pushed.
COPPER
PRICE CONTENTIONS
THERE ARE SOME disagreements in
international circles as to whether the
supply/demand situation for copper
justifies its current price of about $950
a ton. Latest statistics suggest that
there is no longer a copper shortage
either in the U.S. or Europe, and this
despite drought conditions hitting the
supply from Chile, problems allied to
fuel supplies in Zambia, the continu-
ing heavy demand for war purposes in
Vietnam, purchases by Communist
China, and the general instability of
the international monetary system.
How long these isolated factors will
continue to combine and support the
price of the metal at its current price
is the point of contention. One faction
believes that sooner or later the price
will have to reflect the substantial,
though hidden, surplus existing, and
will come back to a level of $BOO a
ton. Others suggest that though this
might well be so, in the current inter-
national atmosphere it is going to be
a very long and slow process.
Meanwhile, U.S. copper producers
are preparing to belie such thoughts
and undertake expansion projects
worth more than $lOOO million, includ-
ing $650 million to be spent by
Anaconda alone in the U.S., Peru,
British Columbia, and Chile. If, as
some critics would have it, current
prices are a result of a support opera-
tion launched by the major producers,
then they are obviously quite confident
of keeping it up.
And it does not seem at all like a
false market in Japan, where last year’s
consumption of 683,700 tons is ex-
pected to reach the million mark by
1975. Japanese cable makers are rather
more worried that future supplies will
not be maintained and are proposing to
set up a stockpile of 20,000 tons to
stabilise supply, the cost to be borne
by cable makers, brass makers, copper
smelters, and importers.
It is an interesting move. A sub-
stantial section of Japanese copper
manufacturers appear to be prepared
to make a collective and substantial
investment to provide against future
shortages of the metal. If and when
the scheme materialises, and for this
to happen the approval of government
agencies must still be obtained, copper
will be released from the pile when
the supply of the metal becomes tight
and prices rise unusually high. All of
which suggests that the Japanese along
with the U.S. producers foresee a con-
tinuing profitable future for the metal.
Further than that, the Japanese are
quite aware that if supplies do become
tight, a 20,000-ton stockpile is not
going to go very far at the current
rate of their consumption. With that
in mind seven Japanese copper com-
panies are jointly planning to open
negotiations with Rio Tinto-Zinc Cor-
poration for a stake in the develop-
ment of the Bougainville copper de-
posits of CRA and New Broken Hill.
If plans go ahead at Bougainville,
it should be producing 120,000 tons of
copper a year in concentrates, more
than the total current Australian out-
put, of which the Japanese would like
to take 50,000 tons.
MIGRATION
ESCAPE FROM BRITAIN
AS THE ECONOMIC screw turned
again in Britain, the long-suffering citi-
zens made their by - now customary
stampede toward the offices of the
Australian migration department
1968-69 should prove a bumper year
for Mr. Snedden at least.
Assisted migrants during the first
three months of this year to September
increased by almost 10,000 to 24,702
over the same period last year, assisted
by Mr. Jenkins’ first Budget—there is
a time lag of roughly six months be-
tween the decision to migrate and the
event, with something like 50 percent
falling by the wayside in the mean-
time. Mr. Jenkins’ latest dose of strin-
gent medicine ominously threatening a
Scrooge-like Christmas and a winter of
bitter discontent should ensure an in-
creasing surge through the rest of the
year.
Mr. Snedden has set himself a target
of 105,000 assisted migrants for the
year compared with the 82,247 who
arrived 1967-68. He will almost cer-
tainly exceed that. U.K. applications
July-October have been running 50 per-
cent ahead of last year. In Europe the
Special Passage Assistance Program is
reported to be exerting a similarly
healthy attraction, while a new agree-
ment with the Netherlands has simpli-
fied migration procedures there, as has
the presence of the Colonels in Greece.
Understandably, only Germany has
proved resistant to the cajolings of the
migration department.

A REMARKABLE RESULT:
PRESENTING THE
NINTH ANNUAL REPORT
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: It has
been a momen,tous year; like the ninth
symphonies of Beethoven, Bruckner, and
Schubert, today’s ninth annual report is
by far the best. It will be hard to
avoid an anti-climax next year, as it
seems highly unlikely that the remark-
able result for 1967-68 can be repeated
in the current financial year. Never-
theless, every effort will be made to
maintain, the rate of earnings growth.
Profit: Trading for the 12 months
ended November 30, 1968, resulted in a
profit of $13,805, a record. This repre-
sents an earning rate of 113 percent on
the funds employed at the beginning of
the period. It has been despite a can-
tankerous disagreement with the market
two months ago that resulted in some
heavy book losses as investments con-
tinued to be made as the market con-
tinued to fall. These losses, particularly
in Oil Search, BHP, and Ampol Ex-
ploration, have been fully provided for
in the accounts (despite the fact that
profits are ultimately expected on each
of them) and the portfolio is valued at
current market prices.
The history of the growth of the
portfolio is shown in the table on this
page. An amount of $4OOO was the
original base in 1959 but, when the
portfolio had grown to $27,210 in 1964,
the profit of $23,210 was taken out for
living expenses and the base was
reduced to $4OOO once again. Had this
distribution not been made, the port-
folio would now stand at just short of
$50,000, or about times the original
stake of nin,e years ago. The value of
the portfolio now totals $26,032, includ-
ing cash in hand of $11,168. With your
approval, it is intended that a distribu-
tion of $16,032 be made in order to
reduce some pressing external liabilities,
so reducing the portfolio in size to
$lO,OOO. This means that disposals of
$4864 have to be made from current
holdings and these will be reported next
week.
In, some instances, shares have been
held in the portfolio long enough to
benefit from dividend payments. These
have in all instances not been credited
to the portfolio and have been spent
taking brokers and journalists to lunch
in order to benefit from their wide
knowledge of the market. It is hoped
that in future the turnover of stock
will be fast enough to reduce this
income and therefore render this expen-
diture unnecessary.
Trading Review: During the period
in which the portfolio increased in
value by 113 percent, the Sydney all
ordinaries share price index rose by
30 percent and the mining section of
that index rose by more than 50 per-
cent. It would have taken rare skill
ito have lost money over this period,
but, while it is to be expected that a
portfolio such as this should do better
than the index, it is nevertheless grati-
fying to see how much better than the
index it managed to do.
This is particularly so in a situation
in which there was a marked reluct-
ance to risk the fund in mining ven-
tures in the early part of the year.
Nevertheless, in this period, some of
the major successes were in mining
stocks, for instance, Papuan Apinaipi.
The strong move into the mining
market, regrettably after it had passed
its peak, has nevertheless brought some
substantial rewards in the later part
of the year, particularly from such
stocks as Western Collieries, Woodside,
and King Island Scheelite.
It is striking that the biggest profit
made on any transaction during the
year was from an industrial stock,
Slater Walker, which contributed
almost one-third of the year’s income.
Despite the mining boom, a very large
proportion of the portfolio’s profits
came from trading in industrial shares.
For instance, the portfolio’s holdings
of takeover stocks like Concrete Indus-
tries and Prestige brought it consider-
able benefits.
Market Outlook: At this time last
year, the mining market was very un-
easy indeed following, coincidentally, a
dreary report from Great Boulder
(which at that stage looked more like
a little rock). And in oils, everyone
was pinning their hopes on drilling off
the W.A. coast at that time at Ash-
more Reef. In the event oils turned
out to be something of a disappoint-
ment and nickels a success. This year
there seems every chance of the situa-
tion being reversed.
One thing that has emerged from
the nickel story of the past year is
that it takes a lot of effort and a great
deal of luck to find the nickel in the
first place, it takes a long time to
prove it in the second place, and it
takes a very long time indeed before
it is eventually mined, processed, and
bringing in profits. But for oils, the
outlook is very bright indeed, with
Woodside riding high, Ampol spend-
ing more and more offshore through
Wapet, and the Alliance group to spud
in at Bonaparte Gulf in the new year.
One sour note is on the industrial
front. The balance of payments situa-
tion indicates pretty clearly that the
Government is going to keep a tight
hand on liquidity. This policy of
restraint could hold back the advance
on company profits that would other-
wise have come; it looks as if it could
turn out to be a very competitive year
for companies.

BRIEFLY
The GCOnomyl The Federal Treasurer, Mr. W.
McMahon, feels the financial situation in Germany, France,
and Britain may be “mildly favorable to Australia”—
with the emphasis on mildly and some
doubts about the middle and long term.
The Australian Wool Industry Conference finally
mustered sufficient support to recommend formation
of a non-statutory Australian Wool Marketing
Corporation, so the case now has to be put for financial
backing from the trading banks and the Government.
New private capital spending fell back by $6.5
million (seasonally adjusted) in the September quarter
from the June quarter’s $484.8 million to
$478.3 million; it was still well above last year’s
corresponding level.
Seasonally adjusted, new motor vehicle registrations
hit 36,738 for October, just above those for
the previous October.
Australia has gained entry into the Australia-Europe
Shipping Conference and the Australian-North
America conference by the device of chartering and
running two container vessels.
The markets * A bundle of recent happenings—the
currency troubles, an, oil strike, and Western Mining—
could not keep a surface vigor in Australian share markets,
so the end of the week turned very flat, with price movements
fairly marginal in most index sections. Takeover moves,
of course, provided the main focus of definite attention.
Leaders and the big miners began to creep downward
again. Among the losses were: BHP $19.65 (35 cents),
Western Mining $10.90 (20 cents), Great Boulder $9.10
(90 cents), Peko $9.98 (12 cents), King Island Scheelite
$16.10 ($1.30), and Consolidated Gold Fields $7.80
(20 cents). CRA remained at $19.00. Golds came back
after previous flurries.
General Industries, in active demand, put on 20 cents
to reach $1.70. Following Slater Walker’s withdrawal,
Drug Houses slipped from $2.40 to $2.00. Bank of New
South Wales, at $7.82, added 32 cents and John Lysaght
advanced 20 cents to $3.60.
Industrials looked very irregular in London, which
received some excitement from the Unilever-Allied Breweries
merger talks.
Wall Street pushed ahead on high turnovers, with some
favorable economic pointers providing the stimulus.
Companies’ The tug and counter-tug of takeovers, with
lots of trimmings, continue to furnish most of the excite-
ment . . . After gaining control of Drug Houses of
Australia on the market, Slater Walker resisted DHA
directors’ request for a cash bid covering the rest of the
shares, being content to increase the value of the
formal share-debenture offer and providing a full debenture
alternative . . . King Island Scheelite’s four-man board
is evenly divided on the merits of the Peko-Wallsend and
Consolidated Gold Fields Australia offers, so can’t
recommend either; CGFA will now accept all shares offered,
while Peko, ahead of its formal bid, telegrammed all KIS
shareholders (some 3000 of them) to state its advantages in
94 words . . . The Redland (U.K.) group pressed forward
on the market in the attempt to secure Concrete Industries
and cancelled talks with Cl directors because of rumors
that discussions would point toward a higher bid ... A
cash bid worth $1.47 million comes from Automotive and
General Industries for the whole of Neon Electric Signs . . .
Lawrence and Hanson still awaits details from Kempthome
Mistral and repeats “don’t sell” advice.
A note of criticism came from the banks, led off by the
National, whose chairman, Sir James Forrest, thought
the recent increase in the Statutory Reserve Deposit ratio
“unnecessarily restrictive,” though he didn’t want to
give the impression that he was unsympathetic to the
Reserve Bank’s many problems . . . Sir John was joined
by Sir Arthur Rymill, of the Bank of Adelaide, who
thought “the foreseeable trends in bank liquidity would have
dictated a restraint on bank lending without the curb” . . .
The Bank of New South Wales annual report gave a
string of reasons for the notable 1967-68 profit jump,
including “continuance of official policies of less restraint
in monetary matters.”
Miners still had a fair amount to boast about . . .
Tipperary Land Corporation’s bauxite find south of Weipa
may be one of the world’s largest deposits, with grades
much the same as Weipa’s . . . Japanese aluminium refiners
may be interested in joining American Metal Climax
(Amax) in plans to build an alumina refinery in the
Kimberley district (W.A.) . . . Mitsui and Co. is to join
Adelaide Steamship’s salt project at Shark Bay
(W.A.).
With its first share issue in 12 years, British Tobacco is
seeking $18,636,720 and shareholders on March 6 next
will be offered one new share for every four held
at 100 percent premium.
Paintmaker Taubmans sent earnings up from $947,000
to $1,013,000 and kept the 16 percent dividend . . .
Australian Fertilizers came back from $1,223,422 to
$1,035,979, holding the traditional 8 percent payout on a
10.7 percent earning rate.
Pre-tax profit of Ampol Petroleum more than doubled
in the year to September 30, but net profit went up
34.1 percent —from $6,750,154 to $9,100,000; the 10 percent
dividend was safely covered by a 15.2 percent earning
rate; the company made a “slight gain” in its share of
the petroleum products market and received a major
contribution from its share of Barrow Island.

THE LAND
Dams can’t be raised
by waving a hand
Burrendong
Dam ...
it took 21
years
THERE’S NOTHING LIKE a drought,
unless it is a series of droughts, to
whip up enthusiasm for water con-
servation. At the present, six new
schemes are said to be under considera-
tion in Canberra for water storage in
various parts of the country, quite apart
from the numerous projects already
planned for metropolitan and country
storages and others already in progress.
Yet, even with more than $lOO million
worth of water-conservation funds being
applied annually, the Minister for
National Development has been under
fire in Parliament for neglecting water
conservation, as well as other lines of
basic-service development. His run-
down of the arrangements during the
censure debate was illuminating, though
he could have capped it off with a
resume of the problems brushed aside
by those who apparently think that, as
a sort of national water - diviner, he
can raise dams by a wave of hand
wherever they are required.
The hardest part of the Minister’s
task is to adjudicate on the rival claims
of the States for water justice. These
cannot be considered in isolation from
the overall availability of funds for
the development of the nation’s basic
services and other claims for capital
expenditure (such as the new one for
Government container ships to enter
the overseas general-cargo trades
announced last week). Priorities have
to be established for water - conserva-
tion expenditure in the Commonwealth
as a whole and fitted in with all the
other avenues of expenditure ranging
from roads to F-llls. But when the
priorities are decided and all the capital-
availability calculations have been done,
and the amount available for water pro-
jects decided, undoubtedly the Minister’s
biggest headache is parcelling it out
among the various States.
The Minister is at pains to see that
no particular State feels neglected. In
the case of the special $5O million
Commonwealth fund from which pro-
jects in Victoria to lessen the salinisa-
tion of the Murray from salt seepage in
the Mallee are financed, he has to be
careful (as he was in the debate) to
make sure that N.S.W. and S.A. would
derive as much benefit as Victoria
would from the results of such expendi-
tures from the fund. Of course, he
would have been aware that even an
understanding of this wouldn’t placate
S.A. members committed to getting a
dam at Chowilla and who are now view-
ing investigations into an alternative
site in the Mitta Mitta Valley with
grave suspicion. And he would also
be aware that, with the greater part of
this special fund as yet unspent, men
as far away as the Burdekin and the
Ord would be listening.
This special fund is, as it were, the
Federal Minister’s nest egg with which,
with the advice of the Australian Water
Resources Council to guide him, he
can redress any upsets in the States
arising from the main channel of funds-
provision for water conservation, which
is the Loan Council. Strictly speaking,
the States are given lump allotments
of loan for all their works to be financed
through such funds, but in practice they
stick pretty closely to using their allo-
cations for the projects for which funds
have been allocated, after quite search-
ing inquiry and co-ordination at both
State and Federal levels. It is in the
later enquiry stage that something like
a national adjudication is made on
priorities to be given to water-conser-
vation schemes in the Commonwealth
as a whole. Naturally it is not just a
matter of putting up schemes on the
eve of Loan Council meetings, but
rather of protracted consideration by
both Canberra and the particular State
proposing a project.
Although most of the water unharn-
essed in Australia lies in the north of
the continent, it might be presumed
that this fact plus the heavy expen-
diture incurred on water conservation
in the south-eastern States over the
years would give the north a very high
priority for new schemes something
which Dr. Rex Patterson has been push-
ing strongly for. However, the drought
in the south-eastern States in the past
few years, has focused attention on the
efforts of those States to build up their
drought defences, with the result that
most of the new schemes currently be-
ing examined at the national level are
in their territory. One of these is a
proposal to build storages on the Mit-
chell River in East Gippsland, which
had an annual flow of 780,000 acre feet,
all except one percent of which now
runs into the sea via the Gippsland
Lakes in the Bairnsdale district. At
present, the Mitchell is Victoria’s big-
gest uncontrolled river.
The proposal, which is to build a
small dam 12 miles north-west of Lin-
denow, is meant to be part of a much
bigger scheme and is calculated to
provide 16,000 acre feet for irriga-
tion on the river flats, where the recent
drought has reduced production by
something like a half. This is one of
the State’s best bean-growing areas,
which would respond vigorously to irri-
gation. It is hoped that a big expan-
sion of bean production would attract
more canners to the area and so give
decentralisation a shot in the arm. On
the other hand, this could be an in-
appropriate time to be drawing Can-
berra’s attention to the potential for
bean growing, when so much difficulty
is being experienced from N.Z. com-
petition by Tasmanian growers, whose
canners are threatening to cross the
Tasman. Even so, the suggestion that
more local farmers would turn to grow-
ing beans and away from dairying has
merit in view of the plan to rationalise
the dairying industry.
Apparently Canberra is looking at this
proposal with mixed feelings, because
the Deputy Leader of the State Country
Party, who is one of its strongest sup-
porters, has indicated that if it is turned
down, the money for it will be “almost
certainly” provided by the State Gov-
ernment. The question is, where from?
It all goes to show that anybody trying
to put into effect a national water-
conservation plan in Australia has a
tough job.

These words, dear reader, are taken
from UMON 1, Second Annual Report
of the Australian Meat Research Com-
mittee. Many other passages of similarly
inane palaver are to be found in this
report submitted to the Honorable
J. D. Anthony, Minister for Primary
Industry, by the Committee, which is
“confident that results emanating from
research supported from the Meat
Research Trust Account will make a
significant contribution to the increas-
ing efficiency of the livestock and meat-
producing industries.” For our part
we are equally confident that some of
the research, which is financed by a
slaughter levy of 20 cents per head of
cattle plus a matching Commonwealth
Government grant, won’t ever do a
tittle of good for the industry, but
that some will pay off.
The Meat Research Committee can’t
hope to back winners every time,
especially as it seems to like a gamble
and sometimes puts its money on very
dark horses indeed. Its spirit of adven-
ture and willingness to support imagin-
ative research is refreshing, but it would
be reassuring to know why it considers
that dermatan stuff an “important
reaction.” Merely calling it important
doesn’t make it so. The Committee is
presently financing 182 different
research projects being conducted by
State Departments of Agriculture, the
Northern Territory Administration, the
universities, CSIRO, and the Bureau of
Agricultural Research. (It is also Big
Daddy to quite a number of local and
overseas postgraduate students.) The
aim of most of these projects is obvious
and commendable, although the chance
of ultimate success is often much less
apparent. But the goal being sought by
some of the investigations, such as the
one mentioned above, is quite obscure.
Perhaps in compiling next year’s report
the Committee might provide not only
a brief account of progress on each
project but also a statement explaining
how the investigation could possibly
help the meat industry.
As a result of the recent series of
prolonged droughts, the number of
cattle coming forward for slaughter has
been curtailed and the research funds
correspondingly reduced. Until the
cattle population builds up again over
the next three or four years the number
of research projects must be pruned
25 percent. This is a severe cut and
should provide about enough scope to
scratch out all the dead runners. The
Committee will just have to weigh up
the chances of each project coming
good and estimate the economic signifi-
cance of the potential findings to the
meat industry. In poor times, low risks
and small dividends are to be preferred
to long shots and possible big pay-offs.
The Committee should also seriously
consider winding up its studentship
program. It is clearly illogical to train
research scientists and then be unable
to employ them on useful research
inquiries. It is also unfair to the com-
munity at large, which is left holding
these baby scientists who have a lusty
appetite for salary and a fussy disposit-
ion, which makes it very hard to find
occupations for them where they
will be both happy and economically
productive. The students themselves
would be well advised to think twice
before applying for these scholarships.
Some of the Committee’s dark horses
have, in fact, come home and a few
others seem to be running in a handy
position. For instance, the Barkly Table-
land, which has been treeless for eons,
could now be converted into pleasant
parkland as a result of studies by the
Northern Territory Administration. It
has found that the Pepper Tree
(Schinus molle) and the River Red
Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) can
be established there. The seedlings
will survive the long dry season pro-
vided they are planted on a patch of
fallow. The only real hazard then
encountered is a native rat (Rattus
villosissimus) which cannot be dis-
suaded from eating the young trees
by means of chemical repellants or
cages and drums placed around each
tree. The population of these rats
reached astronomical numbers during
the experiments last year and wreaked
havoc in the plantations. Fortunately,
plagues normally occur only every ten
to 12 years and trees of this age would
be big enough to escape serious damage
by the rats. Provided an energetic plant-
ing program gets under way immedi-
ately, by 1980 or thereabouts the cattle
on the Tableland could find refuge from
the beating sun. To what extent this
comfort could be expected to improve
their productivity has not been assessed.
At any rate the report includes no such
appraisal.
Research at the Department of Animal
Husbandry, University of Queensland,
has shown that the birth-control pill
or variant's of it can be used to sup-
press ovulation. Uncontrolled breeding
is one of the major causes of loss among
the open range herds of the north.
Calves are dropped at the time of year
when fodder is sparse. The cow wastes
away trying to raise the calf and may
become pregnant again while still in
a weak condition. Often both the cow
and her calf are lost. As a first step
toward progress, mating must be regu-
lated. Again, however, no assessment
seems to have been made of whether
fences or chemicals would be the more
economical and practical way. Fences
have several additional advantages and
one might guess that the old way is still
the better way.
The University of Queensland,
through another interesting study, has
now acquired sufficient information
about the blood grouping of cattle to
be able to identify a beast’s percentage
with a high degree of accuracy. Thus,
out of 93 cases where the sires were
unknown, 90 percent were identified by
the University’s blood-grouping system.
By increasing the number of reagents
it is hoped to attain an accuracy
approaching 100 percent. No doubt stud
masters will resort to this procedure
on occasion, but whether it will be
cheap enough for commercial herdsmen
is another unanswered question.

ITS MOTHER'S CHOICE
INSTEAD OF THE
FLIGHTY MRS. JONES
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS ft OIL TABLE
THE DECISION MADE by Marrick-
ville Holdings Ltd.’s board to put the
stern-faced Mrs. Jones into cold storage
for a while seems to be having an
encouraging effect on the company’s
fortunes and management mentality.
Consolidated accounts and annual
report for 1967-68 speak of rationalisa-
tion and reductions in selling, distribu-
tion, and factory costs. Potato crisps,
baking, and stockfeeds are to be the
prime instruments employed in over-
coming the problem of profitless pros-
perity and pulling the company out of
the trough in which it has found itself,
having lost the battle for table mar-
garine’s rights against Mr. McEwen, the
State Governments, and the dairy-
farmers.
In their annual report, signed by the
chairman and managing director, Mr.
R. C. Crebbin, directors points out
that, “in the heat of the discussion about
margarine and its relationship to the
company’s future,” developments in
Marickville’s new product areas —flour,
stockfeeds, pet foods, potato crisps,
groceries, confectionery, and poultry—
have largely passed unnoticed. They
add that the strength of the company’s
growth in these areas “has been
obscured” by margarine’s problems—a
remarkable understatement.
Although the flag-waving Mrs. Jones’
full-page advertising assaults, supported
by other publicity material, have failed
to break up the political opposition to
Marrickville’s “polyunsaturated” pro-
duct, they had the effect of almost com-
pletely identifying the company’s for-
tunes w'ith those of its margarine. It
was not until the first half of 1967-68
that the full impact of the enforced fall
in margarine sales was felt by the com-
pany. The 1967-68 results show the
scars of Marrickville’s lost war for its
“margarine rights.”
In the second half of last year
Marrickville accepted it was politically-
beaten—for the time being—on the
margarine issue and began to ration-
alise its distribution network and con-
centrate on the other products. This
appears to have been successful and
group profit for the first quarter of
1968-69 was higher than “profitability
levels enjoyed over the three years
immediately preceding 1967-68.”
Marrickville now claims 20 percent
of the potato crisps market in Australia,
with centralised production facilities at
Marrickville, Melbourne, and Adelaide.
Bakeries, stockfeeds, and pet foods and
poultry processing activities of the sub-
sidiary Crag group have been strength-
ened, “Mother’s Choice” bread intro-
duced, Olympic Bowling’s four bowling
centres are profitable, and even the
problems with the alginates project
appear to be on the w ; ay to solution.
Marrickville Holdings Ltd.’s board
says that it is now budgeting for a lift
of “more than $600,000 a year” in
profits after tax. This would bring the
group back to its 1966-67 profit levels
and is encouraging new's to shareholders.
H. ROWE AND CO
ELECTRIC TAKEOVER
IT’S SALUTARY that once in a
while strategic company moves in an
Australian industry have no interna-
tional tang about them, such as those
at present enlivening the electrical
equipment and accessories scene,
where all the companies involved in
the various takeovers are dyed-in-the-
wool Australian. The pace-setter in
the integration moves thus far has
been Kempthorne Mistral Ltd., to
whom the going must have seemed
plain sailing after getting Celco Hold-
ings, which gave up without a fight,
and then about a third of the shares
in Lawrence and Hanson Holdings as
a result of a first-come-first-served
offer.
However, lately, some head winds
have sprung up. A direct offer to
shareholders in Lawrence and Hanson
for the rest of that company’s capital
is at present hanging fire the L.
and H. board wants what it calls some
“vital information” from Kempthorne
before making a decision on such an
offer and has warned shareholders not
to dispose of their shares. In the mean-
time, along comes one of Kemp-
thorne’s hardy rivals, H. Rowe and
Co. (Aust. ) Ltd., whose shares have
been watched by all the hawks in
town recently as possibly the next on
Kempthorne’s shopping list, with an
intriguing takeover gambit on its own
account the purchase for $899,000
cash of the Huntingdale 10 HP electric
motor maker Busch Industries Pty. Ltd.
The Busch deal took the market
somewhat by surprise and halted the
upward march of Rowe shares, which
had taken them up to $1.60 from a
low of $l.OO (par) earlier in the year,
a rise which the recent one-for-five
bonus (generally taken as a defence
preparation and thus as a hint that
a bid might be in the offing) did a
lot to encourage.
The question is, where do we go
from here? The company (Rowe) won’t
say much, except that it considers the
Busch buy is a highly sensible one and
that it is alive to market speculations
about its future. From the sound of
it at this stage, it intends to keep its
future in its own hands.

29. not
approaching a national news story
among financial writers?
The collective impact of offers,
counter-bids, shrewd manoeuvring and
eleventh-hour backroom negotiations at
one stage sent the Sydney-based canvas
goods wholesaler’s 50-cent ordinary
shares soaring from the uninspiring low
of 40-45 cents to a one-day peak of 90
cents a unit a dizzy height for this
type of stock. When the smoke of the
battle for Chapmans cleared, the
original bidder, Alexanders Ltd. a
former Brisbane-listed dry - cleaner
which graduated to the status of small
and untried but aggressive investment
company emerged with a controlling
interest of 52 percent in Chapmans.
Chapmans Ltd.’s shares predictably
slipped back to 58 cents a unit seller
(with no buyers) after the three bidders
involved in the contest reassessed their
positions and rearranged their holdings
of Chapmans shares.
Industrial Equity Ltd. (a “Brierley
company”) has withdrawn, announcing
that it would not proceed with its offer
on November 5 and is now understood
to have sold its holding in Chapmans to
Alexanders’ interests, supported by Mr.
Boris Ganke’s unlisted Brinds Ltd. in-
vestment group. This puts Alexanders
into the saddle and poses the question
of what to do with Chapmans squarely
before Alexanders.
The chronology of events is an
essential part of the background. Mr.
Ganke’s group: began buying Chapmans
shares on the open market more than
18 months ago, probably attracted by
their relatively high formal net tangible
assets backing ($1.19 for each 50-cent
unit on 1967-68 figures) and the below-
par market price. On September 13,
1968, with the 50-cent Chapmans
shares being quoted at 40-45 cents a
share, Alexanders Ltd. made its initial
takeover bid, offering one 50-cent
Alexanders share for every two 50-cent
Chapmans share. At that stage, Alex-
anders shares, which last June had once
jumped from 75 cents to $2 a unit on
nickel rumors, were worth about $1.50
a share.
A week later, a successful first-come
first-served raid on Chapmans Ltd.,
through the Sydney sharebroker J. B.
Jackson and Co., resulted in the
acquisition of J 00,000 Chapmans shares
at 60 cents a share by an anonymous
group which later turned out to be
Brinds’ interests. The reason for Brinds’
intervention seems obvious enough.
Acquisition of a large parcel of Chap-
mans shares to supplement those already
in its possession made Brinds the
decisive influence in the anticipated
takeover struggle and offered the oppor-
tunity of making a profit on resale.
In the meantime, Alexanders shares
began slipping down in market value,
at least partly due to a general retreat
in mining stocks. In this case Alex-
anders’ nickel aspirations and prospects
worked distinctly against the company,

opening the door for Industrial Equity
Ltd.’s 67 cents a share cash counter-
bid for Chapmans. Industrial Equity’s
notice of intention was made on
October 18, forcing Alexanders to
counter-attack with a 69 cents a share
first-come first-served cash offer for
100,000 50-cent Chapmans shares. The
bid was once again made through J. B.
Jackson, and Co., Alexanders prudently
disclosing its identity although it
was not really obliged to do so.
The battle moved into the market-
place, with the Chapmans board fight-
ing a defensive battle as best it could
and unsuccessfully appealing to the
Sydney Stock Exchange for a suspen-
sion of trading in Chapmans shares.
This was the time when Chapmans
shares rose to brief and unexpected
glory, reaching 90 cents a unit on the
day of the company’s annual general
meeting on October 31.
The meeting, at which the protagon-
ists turned up in force supported by
market allies, friends, fiancees, and
proxies, turned out to be an anti-climax.
Instead of the expected hard fight, the
retiring board was easily re-elected,
Alexanders supporting the retiring
directors (including one requiring a 75
percent majority) and allowing two of
its own earlier nominations to lapse.
B rinds interests declared themselves
clearly in favor of Alexanders and also
moved for re-election of the old board.
Blinds, of course, is also a shareholder
in Alexanders.
Chapmans shares began retreating
from their 90 cents peak almost immedi-
ately afterwards and the contest moved
into the back rooms to decide which
bidder would sell out to his rivals.
Alexanders Ltd. promptly withdrew its
first-come first-served offer and Indus-
trial Equity then announced it would
not proceed with its 67 cents a share
cash offer on November 5. Soon after-
wards Alexanders announced that it
had control over 52 percent of Chap-
mans Ltd.’s issued ordinary capital and
it seems clear that both Brinds and
R. A. Brierly’s Industrial Equity sold
their interests in Chapmans to Alex-
anders.
Market sources have indicated that
Industrial Equity disposed of its Chap-
mans holdings at 87£ cents a share,
which could mean a reasonable profit
on the deal. Brinds Ltd. also seems to
have made a profit from the takeover
struggle.
Today, there are three Alexanders
directors on the five-man Chapmans
board, now meeting once a week to see
how the company’s operations can be
“streamlined.” Alexanders Ltd.’s offer
for the remaining Chapmans shares is
still open, its attractiveness to Chap-
mans shareholders largely depending on
Alexanders’ prospects.
Last traded at $l.lO a 50-cents unit,
Alexanders is probably one of the
cheapest “nickel speculations” on the
market by virtue of its mineral claims
at Scotia, near Western Australia’s
second declared nickel field. The claims
adjoin Great Boulder’s and North
Kalgurli’s areas and are located about
half a mile from their shaft. The year
1967-68 was a good one for Alexanders,
which, among other things, made a
“substantial” profit by selling an option
over its Scotia mineral claims to an
Adelaide company which is to carry out
all the exploration. Alexanders is
understood to have retained an interest
in any future mining operations. The
tax-free element was important in
Alexanders’ 1967-68 profit rise which
allowed its higher 8 percent annual
dividend rate to be covered four times.
Acquisition of Chapmans means an
increase in Alexanders Ltd.’s paid
capital. If eventually 100 percent
successful, this would involve a paid
capital increase to about $200,000. Alex-
anders would then face paying out
$16,000 a year in dividends if it wanted
to maintain its 8 percent annual rate,
which is confidently expected by Alex-
anders’ fans. On the other hand, assum-
ing that there is no drastic write-down
of Chapmans Ltd.’s assets, consolidated
net tangible asset backing of Alexanders
shares should be about $1.60-$ 1.70 for
each 50-cents unit if the company’s
protracted campaign to buy out Chap-
mans succeeds fully.
Alexanders’ directors say they are
“confident” (as most directors say they
are), and it is believed that they are
aiming at a consolidated net profit of
$30,000 in the current year. In 1967-68-
the company pushed up its consolidated
net earnings from $4922 to $23,626. In
1963-64, 1964-65, and 1965-66 there
were losses, which largely account for
the abnormally low tax provision (last
year: $253). Paid capital at June 30,
1968, was $BO,OOO in 50 cents ordinary
shares with a formal net asset backing of
55 cents a unit.
With Chapmans Ltd. now practically
an Alexanders subsidiary, shareholders
in Chapmans face a Buckley’s choice.
Chapmans Ltd.’s record in the last few
years was not impressive and the market
value of Chapmans shares went up
recently only because of the takeover
struggle. Alexanders’ offer is not
generous if the high formal assets back-
ing of Chapmans shares is taken into
account. But, then, again, the market
is ruthless and the shares are really
worth what they can earn unless some-
one pushes the price up by trying to buy
them up.
At this stage there is no real encour-
agement for Chapmans shareholders to
hang on, although the idea of exchang-
ing their shares for Alexanders shares
may appear uninviting to many of them.
Since its reorganisation, Alexanders has
done well, but it is still an untried stock
on the market. Its directors are
obviously trying to diversify and buying
into Chapmans is probably an attempt
to balance the speculative element in
their company’s future by the acquisi-
tion of a mundane, but conventional,
business operation. It is no secret that
Alexanders is an aspiring mini-size

The Chairman, Sir Lindesay Clark, in his
report to shareholders stated:—
FINANCIAL
The consolidated net profit for the year
ended 30th June, 1968, was $2,630,606, an
increase of $1,415,050 over the previous year,
largely due to income being received from
the sale of nickel concentrates to Japan
and Canada.
Future dividends received by the Company
from the gold mining companies and one-
fifth of the net profits obtained from the
production or sale of nickel ore as provided
in the Income Tax Assessment Act would
be tax free.
INCOME TAX
Under the income tax legislation a mining-
taxpayer had the choice of claiming as
deductions certain classes of expenditure
particularly those relating to capital expen-
diture on plant and mine development in
such of a variety of ways as would vary its
net taxable income to its best advantage.
This Company made such claims in such
a way as to minimise immediate taxable
income.
The Company's accounts should set out
clearly the extent of these benefits and
show them for what they are, namely, Share-
holders’ Equity. The Company’s accounts
had been presented in this form, Note 1
clearly showing the current and accumu-
lated positions.
In respect of the year ended 30th June,
1968, the report of the Company’s Auditors,
Messrs. Cooper Brothers & Co., appended to
the accounts, expressed the opinion that an
amount of approximately $775,000 should
have been set aside to provision for future
income tax account and profit for the year
reduced accordingly. This amount repre-
sented the benefit gained in respect of that
year as a result of claiming income tax
deductions in the manner to which he had
referred. In the future years in which a
deduction would otherwise have been avail-
able, the Auditors’ suggestion would require
an amount to be returned to the credit of
Profit and Loss Account to equalise the
burden of income tax as then assessed.
By minimising immediate taxable income,
the Company’s net profit after income tax
was higher than it would have been other-
wise. In the opinion of the Board, it was
logical that the benefit of the higher profit
was properly to be regarded as an accretion
to Shareholders’ Equity and available to be
used to the Company's best advantage.
NICKEL
The Lunnon mine and concentrating plant
at Kambalda had been in operation for 17
months. The plant was producing up to
design capacity.
A new agreement had recently been entered
into with Sherritt Gordon Mines Limited of
Canada for the treatment of the increased
volume of nickel concentrates now expected
from the Kambalda operation. This would
cover all concentrates treated until the
refinery was in operation.
Shaft sinking and general development at
the Durkin mine was proceeding satisfac-
torily as also were extensions to the con-
centrating and power plants.
NICKEL RESERVES
Diamond drilling had shown a further sub-
stantial increase in near surface ore re-
serves. Further extensions of the Lunnon
shoot had been proved and the Otter shoot
had been defined and was now included in
reserves.
Further drilling on the Fisher shoots had
sufficiently elucidated the structure and
enabled 2,500,000 tons of ore at 3.0% nickel
to be included in reserves.
Two new ore shoots, the Juan and the
Gallatly shoot had been discovered to the
west of the Durkin shoot. Exploration is
still largely restricted to the zone between
the surface and a depth of 1,000 feet and
much of the outcropping favourable contact
zone still remained to be investigated.
The sulphide ore reserves at Kambalda-St.
Ives area had been re-estimated at 14,290,000
tons at 3.4% nickel compared with the esti-
mate of 10,133,000 tons at 3.6% nickel in
June, 1968.
It had been decided to increase the output
at Kambalda nickel mine from 20,000 tons
per annum of nickel in concentrates to
30,000 tons per annum, at the same time
continuing a high rate of exploration. The
additional finance required for the extended
programme in addition to internal cash flow
was estimated to be $3O million. The Com-
pany expected to obtain this by a bank over-
draft and loans.
NEW MINE
In connection with the proposed increased
output, a new mine was to be opened on the
Kambalda West location. This would come
into production in about 2 years from the
beginning of shaft sinking.
Production from Kambalda would increase
rapidly during the coming year as ore be-
came available from the Durkin mine from
the beginning of 1969. On the present pro-
gramme an output of 20,000 tons of nickel
in concentrates should be achieved about
the middle of 1970, and should increase
within approximately a year to 18 months
later to the equivalent of 30,000 tons of
nickel in concentrates.
REFINERY DEVELOPMENTS
A decision had been announced in January,
1968, to proceed with the design and con-
struction of a nickel refinery at Kwinana to
produce 15,000 long tons of nickel metal
per annum by early 1970.
Concentrates produced in excess of the
capacity of the refinery would be sold in
part as concentrates and in part under toll
arrangements. This should result in 20,000
tons of metallic nickel being available for
sale by the Company and 10,000 tons being
sold in concentrates.
EXPLORATION
South of Lake Lefroy exploration was being
concentrated on the Tramways Sill where
four nickel sulphide prospects had been
located.
In the Kambalda-St. Ives area, the land held
was 500 square miles. Of this the Company
must start to surrender areas of 132 square
miles yearly from 30th September, 1972.
This was none too long a time for thorough
examination.
Other prospecting reserves held by the
Company in the Eastern Goldfields had like-
wise to be surrendered in part each year.
This meant that WMC must spread its effort
over the whole of its reserves and not just
concentrate on the obviously favourable
areas near Kambalda.
NICKEL LATERITE VENTURE
WMC had made an agreement with Sherritt
Gordon Mines Limited for the exploration
and development of nickel laterites in an
area north of Kalgoorlie, referred to as the
Ora-Banda-Kunanalling-Broad Arrow area.
Some 200 holes had already been drilled on
the reconnaissance grid and had disclosed
a wide area of deep nickel bearing laterites;
the indications to date warranted close
systematic drilling of the deposits.
Western Mining had retained a 51% interest
in the venture and would manage it.
WORLD NICKEL PROSPECTS
Present indications are that there is still an
overall shortage of nickel in the Free World
and it does not seem likely in the near
future that the primary nickel producers
will be able to meet the requirements of all
customers.

The two tier price system for gold was now
in operation but Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie
(Aust.) Ltd. received no benefit from this
in the past year.
CENTRAL NORSEMAN GOLD
CORPORATION N.L.
The rate of ore treatment at Central Norse-
man remained at approximately the pre-

fell by 0.13 dwts. per ton and the average
operating cost (including development re-
demption) increased by $0.59 per ton. Ore
reserves decreased from 529,000 tons averag-
ing 10.0 dwts. per ton to 425,000 tons averag-
ing 9.3 dwts. As announced, significant gold
values had been encountered approximately
one mile south of Norseman town site. Drill-
ing was proceeding.
GOLD MINES OF KALGOORLIE

This year the rate of ore treatment con-
tinued at approximately the same level as
in the preceding year although a higher
proportion of ore came from the Mt. Char-
lotte lease. Operating costs per ton at both
Fimiston and Mt. Charlotte were $9.23 and
$4.71 respectively with an average of $6.72
compared with $6.53 last year. The recovered
grade decreased by an average of .08 dwts.
per ton.
Ore reserves total approximately the same
as last year being 5,990,000 tons averaging
3.5 dwts. per ton. The refractory ore reserves
at Fimiston decreased from 907,500 tons to
785,000 tons while the free milling reserves
at Mt. Charlotte increased from 5,047,000
tons to 5,126,000 tons. Mining operations
were being reduced at Fimiston and all ore
was now coming from the Perseverance-
South Kalgurli area.
KALGOORLIESOUTHERN GOLD MINES N.L.
The first stage of the agreed drilling pro-
gramme was virtually complete and consider-
ation was being given to future operations.
GOLD EXPLORATION IN VICTORIA
Several anomalies were being drilled in the
exploration joint venture in the Ballarat-
Bendigo area in Victoria, now managed by
the Company.
IRON ORE
The Company had a 50% interest in an iron
ore project in the Geraldton district which
was mining and shipping ore to Japan under
a long term contract. Production require-
ments continued to be met satisfactorily.
Other iron ore deposits in the Geraldton
district were being investigated with the
object of continuing production after the
present contract expired.
ALUMINIUM
Alcoa of Australia Limited, in which the
Company had a 20% interest, had estab-
lished itself as an important factor in the
Australian economy.
At Point Henry, the present aluminium
smelter operated at its full capacity of 40,000
long tons per year. A new pot line was being
installed to double its capacity to 80,000
tons per year by 1969 and within three years
of completion of this expansion, capacity
would be raised further to 90,000 long tons.
TALC
Three Springs Talc Pty. Ltd., of which the
Company owned half, had recently con-
cluded an agreement to supply its annual
production of talc for the overseas market
to the Cyprus Mines Corporation of the
United States for an indefinite period. De-
liveries increase annually until a figure
approaching 60,000 tons should be reached
in 1976.


THE SOUTH BRITISH INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED
REVIEW BY THE CHAIRMAN
Mr. Kenneth B. Myers, on behalf of the Board of Directors
Your Group has completed another successful and eventful year in
which premiums written, underwriting surplus, investment income and
consolidated net profit alt advanced to new levels. In addition, we
entered the field of life assurance.
The Accounts show these salient features as follows:
PREMIUMS written during the year rose by $4,214,109 to $41,065,906.
UNDERWRITING SURPLUS increased from $1,467,767 to $1,761,947.
INVESTMENT INCOME yielded $2,815,190 net of taxation, an increase
of $501,061 over the previous year’s figure.
PROFIT. After provision for depreciation which absorbed $467,741,
consolidated net profit of the Group transferred to Appropriation Account
amounts to $4,109,396 compared with $3,384,051 last year, an increase of
$725,345.
THE LIFE ASSURANCE FUND AND RESERVES stand at
$16,545,698.
DEVALUATION
An event of material significance was the devaluation of New Zealand
currency on 21st November last year. This necessitated a revaluation
in terms of New Zealand currency of liabilities relating to and assets
held in overseas territories, in which the bulk of our business is
transacted. Overseas liabilities included departmental provisions for
unexpired risks, of which revaluation adjustments are shown in the
individual underwriting accounts as separate items to the opening pro-
visions brought forward from the previous year. This procedure also
places the outcome of the year’s underwriting operations in proper
perspective. At the close of the year provisions for unexpired risks in
overseas territories were computed on the customary formula, and
converted to New Zealand currency v at post-devaluation rates of exchange.
Liabilities in overseas countries were more than covered by overseas
assets held at devaluation date which likewise appreciated in terms of
New Zealand currency.
These revaluation adjustments were effected by transfers from and to
Exchange Reserves and the net gain largely accounts for the substantial
increases in those Reserves as shown by the Balance Sheets, with
consequent benefit to Shareholders’ Funds.
Note 2 to the Accounts clearly sets out the manner by which—having
regard for differing balance dates—overseas underwriting and investment
income transactions have been converted to New Zealand currency.
From this it will be seen that premium income derived from other than
New Zealand sources has been brought into account at a mixture of
pre- and post-devaluation rates of exchange. It would therefore be
Inappropriate to express provisions for unexpired risks—computed in the
manner described above—as a percentage of the year’s premium income.
Shareholders will doubtless be interested to know what the results of
the year would have been if overseas transactions had been entirely
converted at post-devaluation exchange rates. These are summarised
below:—
Total premiums written $43,488,375
Underwriting surplus $1,943,136
Investment income $2,925,190
Net Profit (after depreciation) $4,379,146
CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS
APPROPRIATION ACCOUNT
Added to the sum brought forward from the previous year, the transfer
from Profit and Loss Account makes the total available $7,302,552.
General Reserves of the Group have been strengthened by transfer of
$1,099,000 and an interim dividend at the rate of 6 cents per share
was paid last May.
Your Board are of the opinion that shareholders are entitled to
participate in the improved result and recommend a final dividend of
lIV2 cents per share in the belief that the total distribution of 17V2%
can, in the ordinary course, be maintained in subsequent years.
At the same time, your Directors are aware that the final distribution
now recommended enhances the differential between the interim and
final payments in relation to the intervals at which they have customarily
been paid. Consideration will be given to restoring a measure of
equality but any alterations which may be made in the amount or date
of the next interim payment should not be construed as an implied
alteration to the distribution which will be recommended for the entire
year.
SOUTH BRITISH UNITED LIFE
ASSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED
During recent years, it became increasingly apparent that our
Branches, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, were at a dis-
advantage in providing a complete insurance service through their
inability to offer life assurance protection. This had exercised the
minds of your Directors and General Manager who were concerned to
correct that situation, and active investigations were pursued with that
end in view.
As you already know, these culminated in the acceptance of an offer
by South British to acquire the share capital of Australasian Capital
Assurances Limited which was incorporated in New South Wales in
1921. This Company thus became a wholly owned subsidiary within
the Group and was subsequently re-named South British United Life
Assurance Company Limited. Head Office is in Sydney and with
branches at Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth, it provides an
excellent basis for development of a life portfolio. An extension of
activities to Tasmania is about to take place.
It is particularly pleasing that the Chairman of Directors, Mr. Desmond
J. Mooney, who has been associated with the company for some 40
years, Mr. W. J. Dowd, Managing Director, and Mr. J. M. McKellar
White, Director, have all willingly consented to continue in office.
South British is represented on the Board of the life company py Sir
William Mackay, Mr. J. W. Dunlop, and our General Manager, Mr.
G. Lennox-King, while the United Company is represented by Mr.
D. A. T. Dickins, Mr. H. Dixson, and Mr, J. H. Broinowski.
Equally pleasing is the knowledge that the merger with our Group
has been enthusiastically received by the staff of S.B.U. and that Mr.
Mooney enjoys their loyal support in the re-oriented activities of that
Company.
Your Board are confident this venture will close the underwriting
gap in our organisation in the Commonwealth and look forward to the
steady and rewarding growth of this new member of the Group.
The Life Assurance Balance Sheet provides an indication of the extent
of its activities.
Shareholders will understandably be anxious to know what progress
has been made towards commencement of life assurance business in
New Zealand. This is a matter which has been examined very carefully
and I am sure you will be pleased to learn that a subsidiary life
company is in course of registration under title of “The South British
Life Assurance Company Limited’’ which will commence business early
in 1969.
UNDERWRITING
FIRE DEPARTMENT.—Disregarding the effects of devaluation, a
very satisfactory and encouraging rate of growth was achieved. Unhappily,
we sustained a setback in the result from inward reinsurance treaties
which was disappointing after their return to profitability in the
previous year.
Insurance against damage caused by the forces of nature is customarily
written in this department and the profit derived from our New Zealand
operations was severely reduced as a result of the disastrous storm
which swept the country last April.
Elsewhere, we escaped serious involvement in major disasters but the
two factors mentioned above were sufficient to make the outturn less
favourable than we had hoped for. Even so, the ability of the
Fire Department to absorb these setbacks and still return a consistently
good result is very gratifying and amply justifies our underwriting policy.
MARINE DEPARTMENT.—For the first time in very many years,
marine and transit business produced a loss.
The fall in revenue reflects to some extent the progressive elimination
of unsatisfactory business to which reference was made in last year’s
review and increased losses are partly attributable to that source. In
addition, our Indian and Far East branches were very extensively
interested in cargoes on vessels detained in the Suez Canal in respect
of which claims presented reached very substantial proportions.
There is evidence of a more stringent market attitude towards the
underwriting of marine and transit risks but although underlying trends
appear more favourable, it is anticipated it will be some time before
this account returns to the profitability of former years.
ACCIDENT DEPARTMENT.—The increase in revenue is entirely due
to devaluation without which there, would have been a decline following
deliberate disengagement from a number of foreign commitments.
A deterioration in the Workmen’s Compensation section was offset
by a welcome improvement in the outturn of motor business, particularly
in South Africa where we no longer write Compulsory Third Party
Insurance. It is a sign of the times that there has been a noticeable
increase in the demand for burglary insurance.
TERRITORIAL COMMENT
Notwithstanding the economic difficulties of the last 18 months, our
New Zealand business expanded at a satisfactory rate and as befits
our position as a Dominion company, we continue to satisfy a large
proportion of the requirements of the local market.
The new building adjoining our present Head Office structure is
nearing completion and the congestion which has hampered our
Auckland organisation and the Guardian Trust should be relieved when
occupancy of the additional premises is assumed next year.
The position of Australia as our largest field has been enhanced by
the decision of the Government of that country not to devalue. We
participated in and contributed to' the impressive development which
has taken place in the Commonwealth and with our entry into life
insurance, are well poised to share in the further development which
lies ahead.
A new building at Brisbane housing both the South British and United
branches was officially opened by Sir William Mackay last April. New
premises were completed at Mackay in North Queensland and a
property was purchased for redevelopment at Albury, N.S.W. These
facilities will assist the co-ordination and expansion of Group operations
in those areas.
It is particularly satisfying that our branches in the Indian sub-
continent and the Far East should have maintained their position in the
face of continuingly difficult conditions. Their contribution to the
Group’s progress is not simply to be measured by the useful profits
they return for, as has been said on previous occasions, they add
balance to the overall portfolio and in addition, provide valuable
experience for our staff.
Farther afield, the decision was made to withdraw from Nigeria, and
also from Aden where the political outlook offers little, if any, prospect
of reasonable tradinq conditions. The latter decision was taken with
great regret as we had been well served by our agents in Aden with
whom we enjoyed most cordial relations. East African branches experi-
enced a difficult year from which they emerged with credit after
absorbing the full impact of nationalisation of insurance business in
Tanzania midway through the previous financial year.
In South Africa, we participated in the commercial expansion taking
place in the Republic with very satisfying results, while in the United
Kingdom a carefully selected portfolio of fire and accident business
(other than treaties) yielded an encouraging return.
During the year, Sir William Mackay visited our branches in Singa-
pore and Africa. Besides being welcomed by our Branch Managers,
these visits are invaluable to your Board in their understanding of local
conditions as they apply to our own sphere of activities..
INVESTMENTS
The currency crises which occurred during the period covered by this
review called for the utmost care in the supervision of the Group’s
investments.
A large proportion of the portfolio is directly held in support of
underwriting operations and to some extent the field of choice is
limited by requirements of local legislation. Otherwise, but consistent
with the need to maintain an adequate measure of mobility for our
funds, the broad policy has been to take advantage of higher interest
rates while maintaining a selective approach to ordinary shares. On
that basis, investment income, after deduction of taxation, measured
up to expectations.
After devaluation adjustment of book values, market values of invest-
ments held at the close of the year exceeded book values by more than
$3,500,000. We do not look upon our properties as investments as
they are owned primarily for the purpose of providing suitable accom-
modation for our branches, but shareholders may be interested to know
that estimated market values exceed adjusted book values by approximately
$3,250,000.
BALANCE SHEET
Total assets of the Group now exceed $108,000,000 and Shareholders’
Funds which appreciated by more than $7,000,000 during the year
provide solid support for technical underwriting reserves which in
themselves are considered adequate for their purpose. This improvement
of financial strength is a matter of great importance in the light of
problems of capacity which are emerging in the leading insurance
markets of the world.
STAFF
This review would not be complete without an expression of thanks
to the staff. The complexities and accelerated pace of commerce today
call for high degrees of skill for which the Company relies heavily on
its personnel—indeed, its continuing prosperity lies very much in their
hands.
In appreciation of their efforts during the past year, provision for
payment of a cash bonus has been included in the accounts.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
Finally, I should like to record your Board’s keen appreciation of the
services rendered by Directors of our subsidiary companies. Their
experience, judgment, and knowledge of local conditions have been
of inestimable value in guiding the affairs of the Group.

ALLEN'S CONFECTIONERY
A SWEET ABILITY
LAST WEEK Allen’s Confectionery
Ltd.’s 50-cent ordinary shares jumped
up again, this time by 15 cents a unit,
breaking through the 1968 ceiling of
$2.50 a share and establishing a new'
“high” at $2.55. This was 80 cents
above the year’s low of $1.75 a share
and brought the market price of the
Melbourne-based confectionery manu-
facturer to more than five times its
nominal value, against the formal net
tangible assets backing of 76 cents for
each 50-cents unit.
Recent jumps are probably explained
by the fact that the Melbourne broking
house of lan Potter and Co. chose this
time to put the spotlight on the com-
pany’s solid performance, topped by
encouraging results for the latest year
to June 30, 1968. In a circular to
clients, lan Potter and Co. highlighted
Allen’s net profit jump from $525,131
to $636,215 in 1967-68. This improved
the annual earning rate on the
unchanged $1,940,000 ordinary capital
from 25.8 to 33.1 percent. The annual
dividend rate also went up, from 15
percent to 17.5 percent the third
dividend and earning-rate increase in
three consecutive years. In 1965-66 the
company earned 20 percent on ordinary
capital and paid a 13 percent dividend.
Next year, the earning rate lifted to
25.8 percent and the dividend rate fol-
lowed suit rising to 15 percent.
According to lan Potter and Co.’s
assessment, Allen’s was “good value”
w'hen quoted at $2.30 a share, giving a
3.8 percent dividend yield and a 6.9
percent earnings yield at that price.
But even now the stock seems not
unattractive.
Formerly known as Allens Holdings
Ltd. (and before that A. W. Allen Ltd.),
the company has shown an ability to
increase both its market and profit. It
also gives shareholders a chance to share
in the benefits of improved turnover and
earnings though dividend rises. Invest-
ment in fixed assets is con-
tinuing. In 1967-68, the book value of
plant and machinery rose by $208,188
and freeholds increased by $93,613.
This w'as financed by a $167,390 rise
in bank overdraft, the rest coming from
the internal cash flow'. Results for

the first quarter of 1968-69 have shown
new improvement in turnover and earn-
ings.
If the short-term investor may be
attracted by the fact that each Allen’s
share gained 80 cents during the first
eleven months of 1968 and the
speculator lured by the latest jumps
from $2.30 to $2.55 those more con-
cerned with the longer term may feel
encouraged by the fact that the healthy
growth of Australia’s confectionery out-
put is pointed out by the company’s
broking friends.
Keeping dentists and confectionery
manufacturers in business, Australians
are big sweets eaters. In 1967-68 pro-
duction of confectionery in Australia
was about 181 b. per capita, putting the
country close to the American levels.
This makes a favorable general
economic background for further growth
of Allen’s Confectionery Ltd.
FACTORS
MORE RUCTIONS?
MAYBE THIS MONTH’S meeting of
Factors Ltd. won’t quite rival the
annual fireworks displays at the Bam-
boo Room a few years back, when
former chairman Stanley Korman was
lighting most of the crackers, but it
promises a fight none the less. As things
are moving it could be rather more of
a cut-and-thrust affair between rival
factions for the one seat on the board
that falls vacant this year, when the
director concerned is said to be retir-
ing. The hint of a fight came from
the present chairman in a letter to
shareholders counselling unity under the
present board’s banner. Then, on top of
the fact that about 10 percent of the
company’s shares have changed hands
this year in the market (at prices rang-
ing from the present 30 cents to 10
cents), suggesting that a rival group
now has substantial, even if not
decisive, voting strength, comes the in-
formation that Korman family com-
panies have sold their big holdings to
a U.S. company called Savibar. Taking
off the shares forfeited by his companies
in 1965 on which calls were unpaid, the
Korman holdings would represent
about 17£ percent of Factors’ present
$7,582,000 ordinary capital. If the
transfer of Korman’s shares has indeed
been effected, there could be some new
and even old familiar faces at the
meeting. (The Factors’ board has no
knowledge of the transaction.)
Stanley Korman always avowed that
he’d get Factors in the clear and invig-
orate it with the infusion of new
funds, probably from overseas. Well,
it has been free from debt for some

ditioning is no longer a luxury, you can give her a cool
breeze all summer long from as little as $199.00,
which is a lot less than a fur coat and a lot more
practical.
Eleven Models: Whether you’re thinking just bedroom
conditioning or air conditioning for the whole house,
we at Kelvinator have a complete range from the %
H.P. units to the giant capacity 2Vz H.P. multiple room
unit.
Because we know a little more about refrigeration
than most we make an air conditioner better than any,
in fact more Kelvinator air conditioners are in use in
Australia than all other makes combined.
So why not give your wife a cool breeze in summer
and snug, warm air conditioned warmth in winter. It
could be the start of a whole new wife.

own profit came out at $625,000 as
against $690,000 (which includes
$77,000 recoveries of bad debts from
previous years), but latest earnings of
around 8 percent (9.5 percent in 1966-
67) still support the idea that dividends
will be resumed in a couple of years’
time. (The last one paid was in 1960.)
The chances of this are enhanced by the
company’s expectation that 784 acres
of industrial land near Tullamarine
Airport will be ready for sale in a sub-
division next year and that Factors’
big accumulated tax losses will be used
to promote its disposal. The latter was
one of Korman’s expansive dreams. But
whether he still pines for (albeit
remote) control over the company’s
destiny can only be conjecture at this
stage.
Mining
THEY'RE HOTTING UP
THE HORIZON
AROUND MARBLE BAR
A YEAR AGO IT WAS being written
confidently that finality was near on the
Cliffs Western Australian Mining Co.
deal the biggest contract of its kind
written. Nobody will fall for that one
again, although negotiators for Cliffs
have been in Tokyo in what have been
described as last-round talks during the
past few weeks. It is believed, how-
ever, that no decision will be forthcom-
ing from Tokyo until mid-December;
after that, the Cliffs people believe
things will start happening fast.
This comes at a time of remarkable
escalation of Western Australia’s iron-
ore contract situation. It is eight years
this month since the Commonwealth
Government lifted the embargo on
exports that started the explosion of
development. It is only 2\ years since
the first Pilbara shipment went out
aboard the Harvey S. Mudd from Port
Hedland on behalf of the Goldsworthy
group. And in this time $3OOO million
worth of contracts have been tied up;
the Cliffs contract would take this
figure to $4300 million.
The pattern has changed dramatically
in this time. It is little wonder that
most observers are bewildered by the
pace of it all. First, the Mount New-
man group were depicted as the giants,
with their 100 million-ton contract
bigger than any others. But since then
Hamersley, with 11 deals and a total
of 160 million tons of ore and pellets,
have taken the lead and established
themselves as the pacemakers of the
north. The Cliffs contract, worth $1225
million, would be the biggest of them
all, but would still rank the group
second to Hamersley, with a value
on projected exports of $1282.5 million.
The 37.5 million ton Mount New-
man contract is rewriting another
aspect of the Pilbara development
the price story. In the original deal
was a clause which called for the price
to come down if throughput from the
company went beyond 7.75 million
tons annually; this will be done with
the new contract, and Mount Newman
are sending out the cheapest iron ore
from Australia. This is why the Japan-
ese buyers’ policy changed for this
contract. It was understood that all
others waited in the line while Cliffs
was dealt with; however, the low-
priced Mount Newman ore has jumped
the queue.
Apart from being Australia’s hottest
town, Marble Bar, in Western Aus-
tralia’s Pilbara region, is establishing
itself as hub of a notable mining area.
Such international heavyweights as
Cominco the Canadian-based com-
pany that is the world’s major lead-
zinc producer Anglo-American, and
Pickands Mather have been pegging
around the town for some time. Now
Cominco has joined forces with Bamboo
Creek, one of the favorites of nickel
speculators during the boom on account
of 1.4 percent surface indications of
nickel over two widely spread localities
near Marble Bar. For an option over
claims to the south of the town,
Bamboo Creek paid 200,000 fully paid
shares. This option is now being
worked in conjuction with Cominco,
who are to pay Bamboo Creek $2
million over the next seven years, with
equity participation if the find proves
commercial. The normal nickel
horizons are around the 70-mile
Kambalda-Scotia area; this new pros-
pect around Marble Bar is farther from
this accepted nickel belt than Kam-
balda is from Perth.

Sugar Agreement to be ratified in
January and none more so than
CSR, which accounts for one-fifth of
Australian raw-sugar production with
seven out of a total 34 raw-sugar mills,
all of the four mills in Fiji, five out
of six of Australia’s sugar refineries
(supplying 95 percent of Australian
needs), and a refinery supplying all
New Zealand needs from Australian
and Fijian production.
As financier of the Australian sugar
crop and marketer of all Australian
raw-sugar exports, CSR is the biggest
single beneficiary of the Agreement,
which while cutting Australia’s quota
28 percent to 1.1 million tons aims to
increase the world free-market price
of sugar to a minimum of about
£stg37 per ton, compared with the
£19.356 average price in 1967. This
will add $lO million to Australian sugar-
export earnings. The 1968 cane crush-
ing will be completed within the next
couple of weeks. A record tonnage was
expected from CSR’s Australian mills
and, although conditions in Fiji were
very dry for the cane in the early
stages of growth and the abnormal
series of drought years have left their
mark, Fijian production should exceed
that of recent years, without being up
to normal expectancy for acreage
under cane, or up to factory capacity.
(Fijian production can be as much as
half CSR’s Australian production.)
The group’s principal investment and
source of income is in sugar, despite
substantial investment in diversified
activities of building materials, con-
crete, chemicals, iron ore, and bauxite.
But when deliveries of Mt. Newman
iron begin on April 1, 1969, first day
of CSR’s 1969-70 year, the picture
may alter considerably. Accelerated
subscription to the capital of Pilbara
Iron Pty. Ltd. (one-third of which was
tax-deductible but will not be under
new regulations) enabled CSR to show
an unexpectedly good profit of
$14,513,000 for the year to March,
1968. The $1,670,000 profit increase
came mainly from the tax fall of
$1,661,000.
Subscription to Pilbara accounted
chiefly for this tax fall, but,
characteristically, CSR will not say just
how much. With a 20.4 percent
indirect interest in the Mt. Newman
project (CSR owns 68 percent of Pil-
bara, which in turn has a 30 percent
interest in Mt. Newman), CSR’s tax
benefits from mining calls could have
been around $666,000, as BHP, with
30 percent share in Mt. Newman,
benefited by about $1 million in its
year to May. CSR’s tax was alleviated
by a net $2,327,000 in 1968 (no com-
parative figures for 1967), for, besides
deductability of mining calls, it
obtained investment allowances on new
plant and the benefit of tax losses,
offset by the excess of replacement
provision over the amount allowed for
depreciation for tax purposes.

Assignment for a company of uncommon enterprise:
Bring
in outback
iron ore.
Soon the world’s steelmakers will need
300 million tons of iron ore each year.
Happily there are still vast iron ore reserves
available, although many are in nearly in-
accessible areas—eight billion tons in Aus-
tralia alone. Dravo’s assigment: move into
the rugged Western Australia outback with
engineers, skilled labor, tons of materia!
and build one of the largest pelletizing
plants in the world.
The plant recently went on stream at
Dampier for Hamersley Iron Pty., Limited
and will produce 2,000,000 tons of pellet-
ized iron ore annually to help feed the
world’s steel mills.
Since entering the field. Dravo has be-
come the leading engineering and con-
struction organization with experience
both in beneficiation and agglomeration.
Dravo-built iron ore pelletizing plants, on
stream or under construction, are capable
of producing 30 million tons a year—a third
of the world’s capacity. All these plants
utilize the Dravo-Lurgi traveling grate
process.
A pelletizing plant makes use of only a
few of Dravo’s skills: engineering, plant
construction, design and project manage-
ment. Other Dravo assignments cover bulk
materials handling complexes, water and
waste treatment systems, conventional or
nuclear power plants, development of un-
derground and open-pit mine facilities,
dams and tunnels to capture and distribute
water resources. And these are just a few.
To learn more about Dravo, you are in-
vited to read the REVIEW, a quarterly
magazine. You may receive personal cop-
ies by writing Dravo Pty. Ltd., 30 Ord
Street, Perth or 49 York Street, Sydney.

ment Act, as regarding mining expendi-
ture and mining calls as from May 9,
1968, will add to tax liabilities in future.
So CSR directors felt in July that indi-
cations were that the company would
find it extremely difficult to match the
1968 profit. But they may have up-
graded their expectations, in the light
of later development, by interim report
time.
CSR’s actual capital expenditure on
new plant is not divulged, but the cost
of machinery, plant and equipment, and
factory buildings in the books rose
$8.7 million to a gross $l3O million
before replacement provision, although
the $8.7 million difference may be after
sale of some fixed assets. (There was
a net loss on sale of fixed assets during
the year of $347,000.) Contracts for
capital expenditure unprovided for in
the accounts rose from $6.2 million in
1967 to $25 million in 1968, according
to balance-sheet footnotes, so clearly
huge investment is contemplated. It is
understood to be largely in the iron
project, where the capital cost is now
raised to $2lO million.
The book value of CSR investment
in Pilbara went up from $3.9 million
in 1967 to $22.6 million in '1968. CSR
will be looking for a material profit
from Pilbara in 1970-71, two years
hence. There are many imponderables
in this long-term project, but if Mt.
Newman can earn the same as Ham-
ersley is earning, about $l.BO a ton
profit after all charges, including those
for future tax, CSR’s share of Mt. New-
man profits in 1975 could be around
$5.76 million.
Amax, as spokesman for its Mt. New-
man partners, announced, on November
19, additional contracts with Japanese
steel mills for million tons of ore,
bringing total contracts to 216 million
tons, including BHP’s order for 70 mil-
lion. The annual rate of production by
1975 has been lifted to 16 million tons,
whereas CSR in its last pronouncement
was talking in terms of about 13 million
tons by that year.
Another project which could add a
new dimension to the sugar empire is
CSR’s Tl\ percent interest in Nabalco.
Final plans for its development of a
250-million-ton bauxite deposit at Gove
have not yet been announced by the
major partner, Swiss Aluminium Ltd.
(Alusuisse). The projected cost of the
alumina plant at Gove has been pro-
gressively raised from $l2O million to
$3lO million on latest thinking, in terms
of a plant with 1.2 million tons capacity
(using 2.8 million tons of bauxite) in-
stead of the original 500,000 tons annual
capacity. Earlier this year, the com-
pany talked of starting up a 600,000-
ton plant in 1971-72. The final go-ahead
has not been given, but senior staff
are being advertised for. The partners
may withdraw if the feasibility study
suggests a return of less than 1\ percent
on equity capital.
CSR’s chemical devision saw large
new capital investment in 1967-68. The
$7 million higher alcohols OXO plant
at Rhodes was commissioned last year,
and the $4.5 million phthalic anhydride
plant, also at Rhodes, went on stream
in 1968 and is performing excellently.
The OXO plant, after initial difficul-
ties, is now working well. The
reshuffling of chemical interests is
expected to enable CSR to more
profitably employ its funds and cash
flow. Prospects were briefly, but firmly,
described in the annual report as
“good.”
CSR Chemicals regretfully sold its
interests in partnerships manufacturing
principally at Altona, severing con-
nections with Dow and Goodrich of
the U.S., because it thought the Aus-
tralian chemical industry had reached
the stage where operations need to be
highly capitalised, and CSR could use
its funds better elsewhere. Realignment
with ICIANZ as the 49.7 percent part-
ner in CSR Chemicals means pooling
of efforts with the major chemical com-
pany in Australia. ICIANZ brought
to the partnership its subsidiary, New-
castle Chemical Co. Pty. Ltd., with
factories in Newcastle and Melbourne,
making phthalic anhydride and plas-
ticisers. Consolidation of its funds
makes CSR Chemicals better positioned
in its chosen field. Its efficiency is
demonstrated by ability to export 10
percent of its production to 29 coun-
tries, in competition with world chemi-
cal producers whose plant capacities
are much greater than Australia’s, with
the security of much larger domestic
markets to cover basic capital costs.
They are then able to offer low-priced
exports.
CSR’s half interest in Ready Mixed
Concrete will make a bigger contribu-
tion to CSR’s 1969 profits, as, in the
year to June, RMC lifted profit 25 per-
cent from $2,089,000 to $2,611,000.
With quarterly dividend payments, and
assuming a three-month lag in paying
them, CSR’s year to March probably
included dividend in respect of RMC’s
profit for the second half of its 1967
year to June and the December half of
its 1967-68 year. Half RMC’s profits
are included in CSR income from other
investments, but, as RMC is technically
not a subsidiary, CSR’s group accounts
do not include tax relative to this.
Building-material activities are rela-
tively unimportant to CSR’s total scene,
but sales and profits did rise during
1968. A new gypsum-plaster mill (the
company’s fifth) started at Yarraville,
in Melbourne, during the year, but
otherwise there was no major expendi-
ture. Competition is keen in hardboard,
where CSR is partnered 50-50 by
APM, and there is surplus productive
capacity in the Australian particle-
board industry, with eight factories
owned by six manufacturers, including
Pyneboard, in which APM is the 50-
percent partner. The mineral-fibres divi-
sion was satisfactory, but the joint
company with James Hardie, Hardie-

The group has huge capital commit-
ments, and, although its retained cash
flow is slB'2~ million, a premium issue
could be offered to shareholders at any
time. In 1962-63 there was a one-for-
seven, and in 1965-66 a one-for-eight,
both at 50 percent premium. Current
market would sustain a heavier pre-
mium than that.
Term liabilities of the group rose last
year by some $l4 million with the issue
of lb percent and 7| percent debentures.
Long-term liabilities, however, totalled
only $4B million, compared with equity
capital of nearly $6O million, and share-
holders’ funds of $192 million, so there
is still plenty of room for borrowing
funds. A share issue would have to be
made at 200 percent premium to com-
pete cost-wise with borrowings at 7f

dollar reduced the value of group assets
by SSJ million, but a sum of $2.3
million accumulated in overseas

as partial offset. How much devaluation

CAN ACI SHED THE
MIDDLE-AGED SPREAD
OF A SLEEPY GIANT?
READING THE 1968 annual report
of the Sydney Stock Exchange is an
interesting exercise. Of 898 companies
listed on the Exchange, 25 accounted
for 62 percent of total market capitalisa-
tion value. The largest gains over the
previous year were mining and oil
stocks, and BHP, with virtually all
BHP’s gain coming from the company’s
mining and oil activity. In the top 25,
mining, oil, and BHP represented 50.4
percent of total market value. The same
companies last year represented 35 per-
cent of the total. In view of the mining
boom, the growth is understandable, but
it is rather strange that the top indus-
trials’ market growth doesn’t measure
up to their “leader” status. In the
case of Australian Consolidated Indus-
tries, market capitalisation actually
dropped $12.3 million over the year to
$151.8 million at June, 1968.
Three months ago my colleague in
“Behind the Balance Sheets”
(8., August 17) made an excellent
financial analysis of ACI, and hoped
shareholders would be approached for
the company’s planned new funds. He
pointed out the plight of ACl’s share-
holders in recent years relative to the
group’s expanding activities. Since that
time a new issue has closed, the tidy
sum of $lB million is en route to the
company, and other developments have
occurred. As I am interested in how the
company is going to perform with its
additional money, it seems time to
have another look at the group.
Investors appear to have been
bedazzled by ACl’s “leader” position, as
doyen of the glass-container and packag-
ing industries, boosting the $1 shares
to a high of $3.80 in 1967. The smart
investor is always on the lookout for
the smaller glamor (or high - flyer)
stocks, but unfortunately many people
look to the tried and true even when
they are standing still. Up to five
years ago, ACI was performing very
well, but something seems to have hap-
pened since then. The group is getting
bigger and bigger, while in terms of
real financial growth, or profitability,
it is actually making no progress. Earn-
ings per ordinary share, the ratios
of pre-tax proft to total assets, and
profit for ordinary to shareholders’
funds are static. Regular readers of this
column will remember my claim for
these ratios as the acid tests of profit-
ability. A glance at the table of
financial statistics clearly shows the
trend.
If the loss from New Zealand
devaluation in 1967-68 had not occurred,,
group net profit for the year would
have risen 2.3 percent, instead of drop-
ping 3.5 percent, and earnings per share
would stand at 19.3 cents, only margin-
ally up on the previous year. The
overall figures seem to indicate the
giant is becoming financially sleepy and
showing signs of middle-aged spread
at 46 years of age. Unless recent devel-
opments improve results, the new issue
will only lower earnings per share
and the key ratios again.
A few weeks ago, AGI announced the
$25 million merger of the group’s New
Zealand interests with Alex Harvey &
Sons, the largest New Zealand users
of sheet metal and the country’s largest
can manufacturer. The merged com-
panies’ activities will be geared to
exports and it is likely some products
will be exported to Australia. The
merger will also move ACI into the
one section of containers not previously
handled. Rationalisation in the New
Zealand operations should help
profitability, but the full effect remains
to be seen. So far the only beneficiaries
have been Alex Harvey shareholders,
who received a nice capital increment
on the New Zealand Exchange, follow-
ing the announcement.
In what appears to be the start of a
long-overdue attempt to lop off group

fat, ACI has been disposing of some
engineering interests. The structural-
steel activities of Bernard Smith Com-
pany in Sydney and Melbourne have
been sold to Johns Waygood Perry,
along with the half-interests in David
Lennox. The move follows the trend
initiated by the sale of Charles Hope
and Brunton Steel to Martin Bright
Steel and the earlier acquisition of
ACl’s axe manufacturing by Pioneer
Industries. In this analyst’s opinion the
amputations are laudable, as there are
far too many operators in the engineer-
ing industry, all working on low mar-
gins. It is hoped ACI is going to reduce
the engineering set-up still further,
because it will need to be in first-rate
shape if the rumored entry of a second
glass-container company into the Aus-
tralian market eventuates.
The chairman’s address contains an
obvious warning to possible competi-
tors in glass with the reference to
ACl’s capacity to supply the whole
market. Such valiant defiance is com-
mendable, but I see an analogy in the
Victorian beer market, where Carlton
& United Breweries’ monopoly is under
attack by Courage. A fight in glass
containers would be a good test of
ACl’s ability to compete in a real world.
Additional efforts to streamline
operations could well start with an
examination of potential economies in
reorganising the wonderful array of
subsidiaries and firms listed in the
annual report. The group obviously
has the financial, technical, and market-
ing resources to be a market leader in
the full sense. The big query on ACI
is when those resources will be put to
the best advantage.
Earlier, I referred to ACl’s middle-
aged spread, which reminds me that the
group comes from the same stable as
DHA, having originated through the
genius of Felton Grimwade. In DHA’s
case, a condition of industrial throm-
bosis has given rise to a takeover bid.
Unless ACI loses some more weight, it
might face the same problem, for not
even the mighty are immune.

Summary: At present ACI is making
an attempt to wake up. There are good
prospects for increased profitability if
the group becomes alert and stream-
lined again, at which time the shares
should move above their current ex-
rights price of $2.50. I suggest a close
examination of the interim report to
see if recent moves are proving
successful.

You’d expect tiny’s gigantic 22 stone frame to
crush this toy tractor. But it won’t. And the
same toy will stand the even tougher and more
consistant punishment your children hand out.
Why is it so strong? Because it is a different
kind of plastics toy. It is made from Hostalen,
the raw material that is changing plastics for
the better. And not just toys. The same applies
to buckets, rubbish bins, kitchenware, or con-
tainers: When they are made from Hostalen
they will be virtually unbreakable, unaffected
by boiling water, rigid, hygienic, easy to clean
and extremely colorful. Remember, the manufac-
turer who makes his products from Hostalen
wants to give you the very best. And so does the
shop that sells them.So it’s really worth looking
for the plastics product with the label that says

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Back to the touchstone in a tin-shed theatre
By DENIS O'BRIEN
ALMOST 18 wearing months of pathos,
ethnic stoicism, and “I-i-i-f I Were a
Rich Man,” six nights and two matinees
a week. To and fro across Australia,
loved, lionised and misunderstood
. . . “My God, we enjoyed it! I was
just saying to my wife, Zellie, here
wasn’t I, Zellie how much we en-
joyed it. And how right they were to
cast a Jew as Tevye.”
Will “Fiddler On The Roof” never
end its run? How has it all left Hayes
Gordon? The answers (a) probably not,
(b) uncorrupted. He is at least 201 b.
lighter than he was when he took leave
from his patriarchy of Sydney’s
Ensemble Theatre to become the patri-
arch of the J. C. Williamson caravan.
He has survived pneumonia and a
broken foot, developed arthritis and a
colon infection, and travels with a small,
private pharmacy into which he dips
by the clock. The role has taxed his
strength, strengthened his effort to lift
the Ensemble out of poverty. When,
these nights, he sings “If 1 Were a
Rich Man” the sentiment is now
slightly more ironic than it was 18
months ago. He is not rich, nor is his
beloved theatre, but both have benefited
from the impoverished Tevye.
“Corrupted?” He explodes. The ques-
tion was devillish, unnecessary. After
years of putting Hayes Gordon’s theatri-
cal motives to the test with cynicism,
it is obviously time to stop. He cares.
“I shall never be so happy as when
I can get back to this tin shed with
all its dissonances and hassles,” he
says. Temporarily he is back there.
“Fiddler” is playing a return season in
Sydney; between performances Hayes
Gordon is putting Henrik Ibsen’s “An
Enemy of the People” into production
at the Ensemble.
As if he had never been away, he is
worrying the big chair in his small and
incredibly cluttered office, glooming
defensively about the production, ward-
ing off the chance of failure with a sort
of superstitious pessimism that he has
called up for just about every Ensemble
production in the theatre’s ten-year life.
Will there be too many people who
will ask, “Ibsen who?” Will the box-
office suffer if the play is proclaimed
as a classic? Will the production, with
a cast of thousands (only 27, really),
work effectively on the Ensemble’s
small arena stage? Will success ever
spoil Hayes Gordon? No.
They are doing Arthur Miller’s 1950
adaptation of the play, pointing up the
comedy in the belief that Ibsen’s punch
will have more impact if his principal
character, Dr. Thomas Stockman, is not
treated too seriously.
“Stockman is a one-out character.
He is Ibsen believing that the majority
is not always right. -But he could be
Galileo, or Sister Kenny, or anyone
who revolts against untested old saws.
We think he will have more relevance
if he is presented as a hothead—as a
Don Quixote —rather than an earnest
fanatic. Frankly, I think this is the way
Ibsen meant him to be.” Maybe,
although the old Henrik wasn’t strong
on humor, and as distilled through
Arthur Miller the play is probably
more of an ideological piece than a
comedy.
But a more immediately interesting
topic is that the Ensemble has waited
so long before doing an Ibsen play.
One would have thought it would have
turned to the father of its sort of
Hayes Gordon and actor Don Reid at
rehearsals (right) of “An Enemy of The
People”
socially realistic theatre long before
now. John Russell Taylor couldn’t have
meant Australia when he wrote in the
Penguin Dictionary of the Theatre that
it is because Ibsen has continued to
exert such power over the theatre that
“his bad plays as well as his good are
constantly revived.” The occasional
“Hedda Gabler,” “Doll’s House,” or
“Master Builder” is barely enough to
convince today’s Australian playgoer
that “Ibsen’s influence on contempor-
aries and following generations can
hardly be overestimated.”
Hayes Gordon turns practical. “Our
policy requires every play to have some
contemporary application. It’s not easy
to find a suitable classic that has much
to say to us in those terms. We have
looked at several Ibsen translations, but
they’ve always seemed so pedantic, so
dated. To be honest, we weren’t aware
of this Arthur Miller adaptation until
recently. It is right for us.”
He uses the plural pronoun without
making it sound like euphemism for
a singular. The Ensemble is still a
co-operative, and although Gordon gets
no backchat as its governing director
he is not an “I” figure; more the Big
Daddy of a liberally lively family.
When he began touring Australia with
“Fiddler” there was speculation that
an opportunistic movement would
emerge to edge him out of the
Ensemble. A Brutus never even
auditioned. The astonishing number of
young men and women who are
theatrical followers of Hayes Gordon,
the respect sometimes grudging
he commands in the profession, and the
extent of his influence on theatre in
Australia make him more of a formid-
able force than his now irritating and
constant self-deprecation can cope with.
So he talks of “us” and “we.”
“Nothing on my tour with ‘Fiddler’
has persuaded me that there is any-
where to be found in Australia a more
professionally conscientious, more
worthily aspirant, or more construc-
tively orientated theatre than our little
project. And as for consistency of high-
quality workmanship . . . well, I feel
the kids at the Ensemble must never
feel ashamed.
“Wherever we have been, we have
found admitted testimony that a num-
ber of theatrical organisations, par-
ticularly the more successful ones, have
been borrowing ideas from the
Ensemble. I was frankly amazed at
this, but I assure you it is the case.
Consequently, irony of ironies, the one
positive thing I have learned on tour
is that the Ensemble formula seems to
be effective.”
And, by now, the formula has fairly
well permeated the “Fiddler” company.
Fred Hebert put the show together in
Australia, but Hayes Gordon has kept
it motivated and out of the trough of
long-run lethargy. While back in Syd-
ney, he’s even using the show as field-


work for some of his Ensemble students.
They attend in small groups, studying
it from the wings, the catwalks, and
the stalls; later they’re instructed to
give notes on his performance. “They
rarely miss my faults.”
“Fiddler” is due to play its return
season in Sydney until early next Febru-
ary, then it is booked to tour New
Zealand for five months. There are
suggestions, difficult as they are to be-
lieve, that the J. C. Williamson organis-
ation then intends to put it around the
Australian circuit all over again. Hayes
Gordon thinks the New Zealand tour
will see him out. He has been tapped
by Williamson’s to consider playing
opposite Jill Perryman in “I Do, I Do”
next year. “I would be a fool to say
that ‘Fiddler’ will be my last show
who can predict these things? But I
think I’ve almost had enough. I
shouldn’t be acting, I should be teach-
ing, directing. It is time I got back to
the tin shed.” ,
According to the course of theatre in
the past few years, the Ensemble does
not brandish as much theatrical adven-
turing as it did when its arena stage was
novelty enough, and the company’s
techniques were so much an advance on
those of actors who thought they were
the play that it seemed as if theatre was
something entirely new. Hayes Gordon’s
continuing philosophy that his primary
aim is to send audiences home as nicer,
more thoughtful giants seems curiously
incompatible with so-called guerilla
theatre and the mixed-media experi-
ences and travestitisms being delivered
off - Broadway and off - Shaftesbury
Avenue. Yet Gordon continues to
attract many of the young Australians
who want to advance the frontiers of
good theatre and for whom the En-
semble is the Australian touchstone.
They probably will never appear nude
or use horsewhips on their audiences to
encourage involvement, but then, in a
few years’ time, fully clothed actors
knitting comprehensible words together
might turn out to be the theatrical
advance of the century, after all.

FUSS OVER NOTHING
Saved. Edward Bond. Union Theatre,
Melbourne.
NO SOONER did “Saved” hit the
stage of London’s Royal Court Theatre
than it was dragged into court by the
forces of Grundyism, thus proving once
again the veracity of the show-business
axiom that children are notorious
scene-stealers. For, while the play con-
tains some lubricious vernacular and an
interlude in which a young lodger
excitedly darns his landlady’s stocking
while it is still encasing her leg, the
scene that outraged that Gilbert and
Sullivan dignitary the Lord Chamber-
lain was one in which a gang of yobs
torture and finally murder a baby in
its pram.

“Saved”
Mary McCarthy was fulsome in praise
of the play’s “delicate escalation of
violence,” Sir Laurence Olivier and
Kenneth Tynan witnessed for the
defence, while the author himself pub-
lished an impassioned letter in which
he protested the purity of his motives.
But the subsequent legal and
literary donnybrooks were a little more
complex than is usual, as there were a
number of important defections from
the liberal camp. Many critics felt that
Bond had gone too far in his evocation
of brutality, one declaring that the play
represented “something of a crux in
modern drama: a clear demonstration of
what is permissible and what is not,
and why.” Bond’s play, he felt,
debased both life and art and many
theatre people were moved to agree.
Seeing it with the usual three-year
delay, it’s hard to see how the Lord
Chamberlain could justify his wrath
any more than McCarthy could her
high opinion. The play is as moral as
a bible-class tract and only spasmodic-
ally powerful, while the notorious baby-
killing episode is not so much obscene
as absurd. In fact, the subtleties of
the second act are only devalued by
the crude shock tactics of the first.
Terence Ward’s production gained
confidence as the play itself improved.
The first act, dominated by the yobs,
was a free-for-all with the dialogue
delivered in such a variety of strangled
attempts at dialect that one was lost
without sub-titles. But in the second
act Ward gained intelligent and moving
performances from his four principals,
Michael Duffy, Juliet Heyday, Bea Cole-
chin, and Don Munro.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
RELIEVING PRESSURES
Going, Going, Gone. Mona Brand and
Margaret Barr. New Theatre, Sydney.
GREEK THEATRE dealt with social
issues: politics, religion, morals, and
art were inextricably linked in the
work of dramatists, who were seen as
teachers and leaders. There is a possi-
bility that the needs that gave rise to
this sort of drama are present again,
and that a world community, asking
similar questions, will choose to present
them in similar artistic forms. Perhaps
a development like film will monopolise
this function Antonioni, Bergman,
Goddard, and Kubrick all go further in
their own ways than anything in recent
theatre, but the fact that this sort of
art has specifically social meaning may
make the immediate physical presence
of drama an essential ingredient.
America, feeling the pressure of this
need for social expression most strongly,
has produced the first approaches to
this sort of theatre: the guerilla
theatres respond on more or less primi-
tive levels, but the living theatre,
which “aims to create psychic, moral,
social, and political change in its audi-
ence, and in the society which is an
extension of that audience,” appears to
have achieved what Artaud described
as “a spectacle addressed to the entire
organism.” The only example of this
soft of theatre in Sydney has been
(briefly) “America Hurrah,” in which
the physical shock of the climax grows
out of the literary and intellectual
preparation of the first two plays.
All this leads to the question, raised
by “Going, Going, Gone,” of what sort
of critical standard exists for theatre
whose impact is not simply aesthetic
and whose point of attack is not simply
intellectual. The show is described as
a “financial revue” and treats Aus-
tralian history down to the present as
a series of financial fluctuations involv-
ing the gradual “sale” of Australia to
“outside interests.” The impression is
inevitably given that a fairly literal-
minded interpretation of Marx is being
artificially imposed in no way does
the view seem to grow out of con-
temporary reality. The point is too
seriously made by the writers to form
the basis of a comic revue, and too
dogmatically applied to produce a
truthful dramatic statement. The air of
conviction about the revue comes from
its staging (Roger Milliss) group
movement in Miss Barr’s inimitable
manner; loud, clear singing; the engag-
ing sense of group commitment which
social purposes give. This makes the
revue a worthwhile contribution to
forward-looking theatre on the level of
form, but its undigested partisan con-
tent makes it a failure as far as “chang-
ing” its audience goes.

EXIT A PUPPETEER
AN ACCOUNT of the misadventures
of Peter Scriven, creator of the Tin-
tookies puppets, since he campaigned
successfully six months ago to join the
board of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
was given in The Bulletin last week.
Since joining the board, Mr. Scriven
has not been paid royalties for a play,
written some time before, still used
by the Tintookies on tour. Mr. Scriven
claimed that this action by the Eliza-
bethan, which has not been tested
legally, has left him in financial straits.
Last week he resigned from the Eliza-
bethan board.
BOTTOM OF THE DIAL?
COMMERCIAL radio spins in a limbo
of its own. No sooner had Sydney’s
2SM decided to drop talkback pro-
grams and chase ratings with the
Top 40 than it lost all sound of respon-
sibility. What had been something called
“free form news” suddenly became
“total information news,” delivered, like
all other SM programs, with high-
pitched hysteria and through an elec-
tronic echo chamber; what had been
the station “at the top of the dial in
the city of the sun” became “radio-a-
go-go.” Station 2UE, meanwhile, an-
nounced itself as “on the go radio.”
Frantic mediocrity knows no discretion,
has no shame.
BELATED ACTION
NOTHING much may be happening
in drama on stage, but there is no lack
of activity in the wings. In spite of the
setting up of the Australian Council
for the Arts and its appointment of a
committee to look at drama, the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust now, 14 years
after it was established, has decided that
what it needs is a policy on drama. Its
board will tackle the subject at its next
meeting in February. By coincidence,
the drama committee will submit its
report to the Australian Council for
the Arts in February, in plenty of time
for representations to be made to the
Treasury for more generous treatment
next financial year. The Council’s plan
is to pay subsidies direct to companies
and organisations involved. That would
seem to leave the Trust with a policy
in the making, but no purpose.
THE GIVE AND TAKE
SPEAKERS at this month’s seminar
in Adelaide on Government aid to the
arts compared the Federal Govern-
ment’s grant of $1.5 million to the
Australian Council for the Arts with
how much other countries of compar-
able size and affluence spend on their
arts. The comparisons do not allow
complacency. Professor Brian Coglin,
lof Adelaide University, reported that
the West German states, districts, and
cities, together in 1967, provided some
$338 million for the artistic life of a
population of some 60 million. To
equal this Australia would have to
spend roughly $6O million yearly. The
German figures do not include money
spent on education in the arts, or the
support given by industry, media, or
commerce to the German arts. Austria,
poor, troubled, and with a population
of 7,500,000, subsidises its State theatre
to the extent of about $l5 million.
Geoffrey Dutton, a member of the
Council for the Arts, produced further
figures to shame the local effort,
especially when he dealt with smaller
European countries. Denmark gives
$4.5 million annually to its Royal
theatre and ballet companies alone, with
more than $2 million to private theatres.
Sweden spends almost $lO million on
theatre subsidies; Norway has a total
art budget of $6.5 million, while the
Netherlands budget is more than
$16.5 million. Said Dutton: “The com-
parisons make Australia’s entry into
the field of Government support for the
arts seem pretty half-hearted.”
NEWSPAPERS GALORE
SUDDENLY, Perth is blossoming
print media. The “Australian” is gear-
ing up to begin printing there soon,
and the prospecting partnership of
Lang Hancock and Peter Wright has
just announced plans to publish a Perth
Sunday newspaper to be followed later
in 1969 by a web-offset printed daily.
The idea of becoming newspaper
proprietors has appealed to Hancock
and Wright for some years. Their
views on free enterprise differ from
those of the Liberal-Country Party
Government, which they consider
bureaucratic and inhibiting. At a dinner
given to announce their plans, each
guest was handed a note saying that
the partners “recognise the real
threat of domination of the ‘West
Australian’ and other parts of the
Press in the State by foreign and
interstate interests.”
Although, recently, West Australian
Newspapers Ltd. have become so
critical of certain State Government
actions and inactions that there has
been friction at top levels, the daily
newspaper monopoly also rubbed Han-
cock and Wright up the wrong way by
.playing down their Pilbara iron-ore
discoveries, notably around Wittenoom.
While Perth’s two dailies (both owned
by WAN) have tended to be anti-
Government, the Murdoch-owned “Sun-
day Times” has swung the other way
(in strange contrast with the editorial
stance of others in the chain), and it is
no coincidence that Hancock-Wright
plans a frontal assault on the Sunday
field.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
FRANCE REVALUED
GERARD SOUZAY’S old magic proved
to be as potent as ever in his first
recital at the Sydney Town Hall, yet
it took some time for this fact to
become really apparent. In the first
Italian group and in the Schubert
which followed there was still a trace of
the odd resonance which drained his
voice of tone in his performances with
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra early
in November, and there was even a
throatiness on open vowels in the
Italian songs which introduced a
timbre which disturbed the melodic
line. In the Scarlatti song “Toglie-
temi la vita encor,” for example, this
had an almost disastrous effect.
The Schubert group was also a
mixed blessing, for coupled with an
immaculate and ravishing mezzo voce
were instances of over-diffuse tone and
a tendency to push the ends of phrases.
However, with the cycle “Chansons
Villageoises” of Poulenc, Mr. Souzay
translated the spirit of the songs into
a palpable experience. Rompish and
ardent, whimsical and delicious, they
were a thorough delight and in “Le
Mendiant,” that remarkable song which
presages Messian, Souzay’s voice became
rock steady and the bitter objectivity
of the song’s philosophy was searing.
From here on the recital was an
undiluted joy which not even the
earrfcst and dedicated 19th-century
romanticism of the Schumann cycle,
“Twelve Lieder,” could assuage.
Before the Schumann came a group by
Roussel, most of the songs examples
of the fascination French composers
have with that hotbed of exotica which
lies below their southern borders. It
was a truism up to the turn of the
century that the best Spanish music
was written by Frenchmen, and remem-
bering Debussy, ' Ravel, Roussel, and
even Saint-Saens this was probably
true for the early part of the 20th
century as well. The franc may be
devalued but what can never be
devalued is the contribution to civilisa-
tion by the French, and although the
honor roll of French composers is
small the French contribution to musi-
cal culture has been immense.
This was epitomised in these songs
of Roussel, which are probably not
major contributions to the art of
music but which are nevertheless the
product of an extraordinarily cultivated
sensibility; a sensibility which is far
from effete or rarefied. After all, effect
is an important part of an art form
and these songs were immediately cap-
tivating. Not a small part of their
effect was attributable, in these per-
formances, to Dalton Baldwin, whose
piano playing throughout the evening
was a model of sensitive collaboration.
To say the pianist in a recital of this
nature is of equal importance with
the singer is a rather dreary cliche, but
to hear Mr. Baldwin step deftly from
style to style, illuminating and under-
lining every facet of every song was a


fascinating experience. An added bonus
at this recital was the actual sound
from the piano; for the hard brilliance
demanded by so many visiting virtuosos
had been toned down and the instru-
ment sounded thoroughly musical in
contrast to Arrau’s first appearance this
year when the piano tone was so aggres-
sive as to be almost unpleasant at
times.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
TOO OLD AT 24
Wild In The Streets. Director, Barry
Shear.
Diabolically Yours. Director, Julien
Duvivier.
BARRY SHEAR makes a striking debut
as a film director with “Wild In The
Streets,” a harsh and bitter parable on
the modern cult of youth. Though it
has universal application, the film deals
specifically with America and a society
in which the older generation’s per-
missiveness toward the young is only
equalled by its own struggle to keep
the passing years at bay to act and
appear young the more feverishly as
you begin to get on in years.
A campaigning politician (young in
the political sense late 30s) decides
to cash in on the popularity of a
narcissistic pop singer. The politician’s
platform is “Lower the. voting age to
18.” But to the teenage idol’s hysterical
“troops,’’ as he calls his fans, this is
practically middle age. By sheer force
of numbers and irresponsibility, they
win the vote of 14 and elect the pop
singer president of the United States.
The politician and his wife find them-
selves relegated, like everyone else over
35, to “merciful” concentration camps
ringed with barbed wire, where they
are kept in a state of LSD-induced
inertia. Even the singer’s mother, who
had optimistically looked forward to
a Pearl Mesta-style diplomatic appoint-
ment, ends up in one of these camps;
while the new president uneasily sus-
pects that at 24 he is getting. past it,
and ends facing a threat from children
whose axiom it is that anyone over ten
is a public menace.
This extraordinary film, challenging
and alarming, strident in both color and
soundtrack, is an outspoken attack
not merely on America’s young but on
American society generally; indeed, it
is something of a tribute to the good
old U.S.A. that it was ever allowed to
be shown outside that country. It has its
application to other countries, too,
which may explain why it has turned
up without advance publicity in a
theatre not noted for interesting first
releases.
Shear’s direction is still slapdash and
occasionally amateurish, and he often
labors a point or repeats his effects,
but these are only the minor faults of
a highly talented beginner; and, indeed,
slickness and polish are the last things
this kind of movie needs. He handles
his players well particularly in his
firm direction of Christopher Jones as
the singer who wins adoration almost
inadvertently by the very sincerity of
his own self-love. Shelley Winters, as
the mother, adds another to her im-
pressive gallery of fine performances.
“Diabolically Yours” is another movie
that has unfairly been relegated to an
out-of-the-way theatre as half of a
double bill with something called
“Buckskin.” It is not in the class of
“Wild In The Streets,” but it’s sleek,
glossy, and highly entertaining and
worthy of being given a better go. It
is a variant of the kind of suspense
thriller that Barbara Stanwyck once
specialised in; a bewildered innocent is
beset by people who for their own
reasons are trying to make him suspect
the onset of insanity.
Alain Delon is the amnesic victim
of a motor accident who is whisked
away from hospital by a beautiful wife
and a hearty doctor friend to a chateau
which they assure him is his own,
though he recognises neither it nor
them. Then the insidious persecution
starts; but Monsieur Delon is a tougher
nut to crack than poor Barbara Stan-
wyck, and soon decides to turn the
whole thing to his own advantage.
Stylishly superficial, handsomely
mounted, beautifully photographed by
Henri Decae, this piece of escapist non-
sense is fun to watch and plausible
enough not to let you notice the gaping
holes in its plot until it is safely over.
ART/ELWYN LYNN
ON THE MOVE AGAIN
Gunter Christmann. Central Street
Gallery, Sydney.
Paul Beadle, Robin Welch. Bonython
Galleries, Sydney.
David Boyd. Barry Stern Galleries,
Sydney.
IT MIGHT be forcing comparisons
to see any similarity between the two
most important exhibitors of the week,
Christmann with his seemingly flat areas
of generally uninflected color and
Beadle’s realist, processional narratives
in bronze, but both achieve what has
been almost suppressed in modernist
art, and that is mobility.-
It is sheer coincidence that Christ-
mann is shaping canvases in the manner
of recent Ellsworth Kelly’s; Kelly be-
gins with a rectangle that diminishes in
size and switches to blocks of different
colors as it slopes at top and bottom.
Christmann will let a triangle or trap-
esium emerge suddenly from the side
of a rectangle. This is to emphasise the
movement from one area of “static”
color to another and to use the vari-
ously sized areas to add to the sense
of volume, for Christmann, with his
fellows, is abandoning flatness and cer-
tainly that flatness or shallow surface
engendered by complementary hues.
Much has been made of his com-
plementaries, but the catalogue cover
shows Rood’s Contrast- diagram of
hues, and Christmann is not after
Seurat’s vibrating, optical neutrality; in
fact, in Stone Mad broad bands of
yellow career across purples which are
subdued by triangles of non-comple-
mentary red; here, and in Slow Twist,
he wants beams of color to detach them-
selves from the painting. Such disjunc-
tion and dramatic contrast is not so
obvious in Open Solo, where a slightly
inflected chrome - yellow centre
is bordered by optically overlapping and
tipping trapesiums of lemon, green,
crimson, and blue, but the shaped can-

vases, except Eternal Blue , are climactic

yellow, crimson, and yellow fracturing

of purple, green, and purple. Orange
Now, with a similar rush into arrested
perspective, also exemplifies a new and
significant sense of volume and
crescendo in local abstraction.
In his bronze vignettes of the world,
Beadle eschews crescendo and the
dramatic; his figures cavort or trudge
eternally around the inside or outside
of an open-design bell shape: in the
Garden of Eden (Not In My Father’s
Garden You Don’t) sinners and angels
of indignation are enclosed in sweeping
palm leaves; in the blackish Exercise
Yard (the only gloomy piece in a show
that is a frolicsome antidote to wow-
serism) prisoners stumble under
iron ribs; in the golden Hub, life is
displayed in three tiers from blacksmiths
and fishmongers to artists and lay-about
nudes, and The Greeks, an unathletic,
bucolic lot, load a boat in circular pro-
cession.

in Defence of Aaron Sherrit after
Nolan, where he makes Nolan’s comic-
ally sad scene ignobly humorous, and in
Joyful and Triumphant, where Kelly
and a policeman are back to back on
horses joined in their middles and
turned into an amusingly surreal rocking
horse. The three chess sets are sensitive,
imaginative, and ironic: kings and
queens have children at their knees,
bishops a cross or crook; knights have
worn swords; rooks are naturally in
cages, and pawns are mere safari porters
one, waiting impatiently to move,
urinates into his pot. Beadle is gently
satirical of sculptural styles and of the
foibles of man, whether passing through
his Seven Ages or prancing at the Sub-
scription Ball at Ballarat; despite the
detail, crowded incidents and whimsical
additives that purist sculptors might
term irrelevant, he is a sculptor of vital
forms and, as Hal Missingham says in
the catalogue note, “. . . these new
sculptures warm the heart after the
somewhat chill air of the minimalists.”
What saves Robin Welch’s design-
pottery, severe, plain, and symmetrical
as it is, from chill minimalism are the
varied, inflected surfaces: grey souffle
dishes are powdery and grainy; the
robust formality of a solid bowl is
softened by greenish stains and brown
mottling on ochre; a severe bottle with
disc-eyes is gently tamed with dark-
grey flecks. He is best when utilitarian;
restriction stirs his imagination, for
when he makes sculptural cylinders he
is too much the cautious designer.
Bonython’s at present ought to be a
Mecca; it has the Sydney printmakers,
with David Rose, Elizabeth Rooney,
Backen, Simkunas, and, above all,
Weaver Hawkins, sustaining quality; the
Comalco maquettes (Jomantas’ win-
ning piece will be erected at the Aus-
tralian Embassy in Washington); and
a mixed show of large paintings with
fine ones from Cassab, Chandler, Boyd,
Juniper, Plate, Marek, Matthews, Cress,
and Dallwitz, the last three rejected (!)
from the Transfield. As Macbeth said:
“We but teach Bloody instructions,
which, being taught, return To plague
th’ inventor.”
What plagues a much-advanced David
Boyd is a conflict between lush pigment
and sharp satire or dreamy fantasy: his
sheer love of juicy paint both weakens
the pungency and over-sweetens the
fantasy; while one might prefer the bony
severity of his Trial series, one
acknowledges a painterly exubei'ance
akin to that of Perceval or his brother,
Arthur. There is a new spaciousness
and a new oddity: Oranges and Lemons
ought to be pure gaiety, but one keeps
thinking of Goya’s witches. He indulges
himself too often and comment is lost
in the cloying impasto; he possibly
needs the discipline of a compelling
theme look, for example, at what
he can do with the haunted vacuity of
The Hostess.

HOW WAS life in the Melbourne and
Sydney of 80 or 90 years ago? Fairly
primitive, you’d say . . . streets like
bullock tracks, oil lamps, seedy,
unpressed clothing . . . and everything
as dull and proper as Queen Victoria

grandfather’s eyes used to twinkle when
he mentioned Bourke Street in the
’eighties or the time he saw Nellie
Stewart at Sydney’s Theatre Royal.
Lively social historians of the calibre
of Cyril Pearl, Clive Turnbull, or Hal
Porter have begun to reveal the
facts of life as it was lived in our
cities in the 1880 s and 1890 s.
Turnbull on Bourke Street: “Here
were the bars, the restaurants, the danc-
ing saloons, where, under the gaslight
glare, the populace . . . whooped it up
all through the night . . . such was
adult delinquency when the world was
wide!” Appropriately, Clive Turnbull
wrote those words in his text for “The
Melbourne Album,” a remarkable port-
MeLle pubSd in P ,960.
fact, the second edition of the plates
which had first been presented by
Charles Troedel in 1863-64. Turnbull’s
book, now sadly out of print, traced
the history of the lithographic firm of
Troedel & Cooper Pty. Ltd., which,
now in its 106th year, continues to
prosper as a modern offset and gravure
printery.
This month, thanks to the generosity
of Troedel’s descendants, Melburnians
can treat themselves to a vivid peep-
show into the manners and morals of
their city as it once was. The firm
has presented the Latrobe Library with
a colorful collection of posters, signs,
and handbills dating back to the late
1860 s, now on show at the library.
As our illustrations show, Troedel was
a perfectionist who saw to it that his
artists and lithographers (who worked
on imported Bavarian limestone) main-
tained uniformly high standards. It’s
also worth noting that Arthur Streeton
was apprenticed to Charles Troedel and
left, at 19, to join Tom Roberts and
Charles Conder at the famous Heidel-
berg school.” Blamire Young, the
watercolorist, designed art nouveau
posters for the firm in the 1890 s, while
Charles Wheeler and Charles Nuttall,
both later to become well-known
painters, began their working life with
“ the thea.re posters tha, you

feld & Nicolson. $11.20.
THIS SPLENDIDLY produced and
most generously and faithfully illus-
trated work on the visions of rewards
and punishments seen by our ancestors
is hardly what we should have expected
from Robert Hughes, the irreverent re-
appraiser of Australian art, the whim-
sical monographer of the art of Donald
Friend, the interpretative analyst of
“The Art of Australia” (a book
snatched out of the hands of reviewers
and withdrawn, but, according to the
blurb, to have a second coming), and
the occasional reviewer of the
“Observer,” the “Sunday Times,” and
the “Spectator,” the last dealing
sharply with subjects such as Nolan’s
illustrations to Baudelaire and Ken-
eally’s “Bring Larks and Heroes.” Yet,
an article, “The Irrational Image in
Australian Painting,” in “ART and
Australia” (Nov., 1963), clearly indi-
cated that he was interested in aesthetic
themes wider than formal analysis and
art as the expression of individual
temperament.
Hughes seems to have some doubts
about the present relevance of his theme
on the artists’ conceptions of heaven
and hell, for our notions of these, he
says, have become diluted, Satan’s
omnipotence only surviving in “namby-
pamby” figures like Batman and Super-
man, and hell only likely to be seen
again “when the sluggish, mutated sur-
vivors have formed their primitive
communities by the Thames and the
Potomac . . . out of that passionate
human instinct to believe in something
infinitely worse than what one has
already.”
There are few such typical Hughesian
asides and generalities, as he is usually
undeviating in his pursuit of the icon-
ography of hell, heaven, gardens of
paradise, and the relation between
satyrs, Wild Men, and Satan; but there
is one odd lapse, for, when tracing the
genesis of the Garden of Eden, he
takes some recent anthropological find-
ings to indicate that the ape invented
man by using weapons and not that
intelligent ape-men invented weapons;
he suggests that we are Cain’s progeny
and that “the oafish, grenade-festooned
corporal kicking in the teeth of a
Vietnamese adolescent is closer to Adam
than ever Adam was.” Maybe we need
a monograph on the barbarous corporal
as conceived by Hughes and others.
Such remarks and those on “our”
notion of heaven as a place where
angels in white caftans (a with-it touch)
waft wings to Mario Lanza on a
celestial Muzak system are not just
unscholarly, but will date the book,
especially as hie reserves such sociologi-
cal snippets for our time and nowhere
relates the notions of hell, heaven, pur-
gatory, and limbo to medieval society,
where they flourished.
He is not particularly concerned
with art, either, except as an illus-
tration of the various places of reward,
punishment, and purging, and of their
associated conceptions of mandorlas,
aureoles, haloes, trees of life and know-
ledge, and octagonal fountains as the
source of the waters of grace. He is
far from an monographer in the style
of Panofsky or Edgar Wind; Wind, for
example, in “Pagan Mysteries of the
Renaissance” (Peregrine, 1967), eluci-
dates some noted paintings by referring
to other works of art and to relevant
texts; with Hughes the text comes
first and then its illustration, though
on occasion, as with the iconography
of the tree of life, he does suggest that
visual iconography may proceed with-
out reference to literature. He eluci-
dates symbols rather than works of
art. He certainly has a vast array of
texts theologians, Gilgamesh, the
Bible, Virgil, Dante, the Odyssey, all
assembled and deployed with easy
authority, but one suspects that they,
like the illustrations, are selective.
Frequently the paintings themselves
are used as texts to explain the roles
of various symbols.
In any case, as Wind points out, the
trouble with such literary evidence is
that the historian will know more about
many ideas contemporaneous with the
works discussed than the artist himself,
who may be using a common, vernacu-
lar symbolism. A further difficulty is
that what can look esoteric or obscured
by the veil of time may have been a
deliberate obliqueness designed for
initiates. Hughes makes the matching
of text and illustration look too simple.
What might discourage any inves-
tigator in, this field is the fact that
Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of
Earthly Delights, a great work of
art whose decipherment is central to
notions of the world, heaven, and hell,
has long been the subject of debate,
especially since the publication of
Wilhelm Fraenger’s book on it in
1952 and Charles de Tolnay’s in, 1966.
Hughes is perhaps judicious, then, in
confining himself to noting how man-
dorlas, mouths of hell, varied punish-
ments, gardens of delight, and hybrid
monsters are exemplified in works of
art from drawings to baptisteries, for
he is not aiming to show how varia-
tions in allegorical purposes or artistic
intents modified the iconography. He
certainly shows how some incredible
ideas, legends, myths, and beliefs
were manifested in art, and since he
clearly regards them as Marxists
regard ideologies one would expect
some account of their sociological or
psychological origins. He does, in the
section, on heaven, flirt with Freudian
theories, which he quickly dismisses,
and one feels that he is dissatisfied,
that he would like to have accounted
for the genesis and the decline of
ideas that once entranced and horri-
fied the imaginations of divines, poets,
saints, and painters.
The illustrations, both in, color and
black-and-white, are exceptionally
good and their subject matter and
juxtaposition quite astonishing; to
have brought the illustrations up to
more recent times, I should like to
have seen Rubens’ Descent Into Hell
in Munich and Ernst’s 1945 Tempta-
tion of Saint Anthony, but there’s
enough in this fine introductory work
to raise grave doubts about our ances-
tors’ wayward imaginations,
MIGRANTS ON THE WHARF
Small boys in line, uneasy
as their father
joins the customs men
in laughing at his own expense.
With fur hats
cowhide bags and songs
the family stands
unshakeable. Port by port
their foreignness
acquired a swagger
they try to practise now;
yet here—small boys,
nervous parents, tight
in a cage of language
sudden and complete.
So they cock their hats
too jauntily, begin
to realise they should have spent
a total culture: that the hosts,
as well, have shibboleths
of ignorance.
RODNEY HALL
ALL IN HEARTS
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
King Queen Knave. Vladimir Nabokov.
Weidenfeld & Nicolson. $3.25.
THIS “bright brute of a novel,” as
the author calls it, was born 40 years
ago in pre-Hitler Germany before
“Lolita” was even a smudgy conception
on a distant American horizon. It was
forged in the crazy, red-hot crucible
of feverish creativity time was run-
ning out that was Berlin in the roar-
ing ’twenties, when just about every-
thing the happy alchemists threw into
the pot, from contemporary music to
dance, theatre, and film (you name it,
they did it), sooner or later turned into
gold, not excluding Nabokov.
At the time, the unknown 28-year-
old emigre was waiting about im-
patiently for the Russian Revolution to
peter out so he could get back home


and go on with the job of living.
Meanwhile, Vladimir soaked up the
atmosphere and suffered his initial
joyous birth-pangs as Nabokov the
novelist. His first books (this is his
second) were still written in Russian
and released in Berlin by a foreign-
language publishing house. Later,
Nabokov was forced to flee again. Like
so many others, he then discovered
America, taking his already formed
art with him. Now, while he is
obsessed by a new work glad tidings!
—he has revised his son’s translation
of “King Queen Knave” and published
it for the first time in English-
Even today the novel is still as fresh
as tomorrow. There is nothing of the
treat-me-kindly “early” work about it.
It needs no apology. On the contrary,
unless this is the result of a major
rewrite operation, Nabokov seems to
have sprung fully matured from his
Muse’s brain. If he has written a bad
book, I have still to read it. Apart
from its own intrinsic value, “King
Queen Knave” also fills in another
important gap in the Nabokov story
which started, for most of us, in the
middle.
What is so astonishing is that this
is already recognisable Nabokov
country stamped with “Blavdak Vino-
mori’s” own kinky heraldic device, a
butterfly-net crossed with a tennis
racquet rampant (and walk-on
foreigner parts for himself and his wife
in the last chapters). Even his own
familiar brand of language-juggling is
there, although this may owe a good
deal to present retouching. But the
same macabre-gay satire paints the
same inimitable sweet-sour landscapes
while the mad humans, whose quirks
so uncomfortably resemble our own,
jump at each tug on the sadistic string
of life. Like “Lolita,” its jocular
infernal triangle, with the cards dif-
ferently stacked, twists on the incon-
gruities of love true love not just
plain or fancy sex and mostly de-
cidedly not pornography.
And just as the real tragi-comedy
of “Lolita” was not that Humbert
Humbert was simply perversely
attracted by his nymphet but that he
still genuinely loved her as the mature
and very pregnant Mrs. Richard F.
Schiller, soon to die in childbirth,
Queen Martha’s passion for her hus-
band’s poor provincial relation, the
callow, myopic Knave Franz, is not
mere passing infatuation, but also the
genuine article. Nabokov’s loves are
not blind: just as egghead Humbert
was consciously aware of the faults of
his ignorant, vulgar, nose-picking nym-
phet, the normally fastidious Martha,
Queen of her luxurious Gruenewald
villa, is undismayed by Franz’s dirty
underwear and smelly, sordid lodgings.
And so Martha plans her husband’s
murder just as Humbert planned Cue’s.
Neither story, of course, is exactly
original, nor was it meant to be. The
Greeks, as usual, knew both: the game
of nymphs and satyrs is as old as it
has recently proved again to be new
(with appropriate Greco-American
overtones); and Queen Clytemnestra
killed her King with the connivance
of her own Knave quite some time ago.
The books teem with many more subtle
classical and literary allusions which it
is much more fun to spot. What is
important, of course, is the manner in
which Nabokov has applied these
legends to our own time and made
them into new-minted masterpieces.
Unlike “Lolita” or “Pale Fire,” this
murder does not actually take place,
except in various forms in Martha’s
demented dreamtime. The beautiful
Queen foolishly dies an unplanned
death from pneumonia caught on the
very boating excursion on which she
had decreed that she and the reluctant,
Nabokov...40 years’ laughter
disenchanted Franz were to have killed
the King. Typically, greed is her down-
fall. She postpones the execution to
inherit more millions. Her big, bouncy
practical-joker husband, the wealthy
King of a prosperous Berlin Emporium
(in which he has given Franz a job as
a beginner-salesman), is about to bring
off a mysterious big deal.
This tunes in to another theme of
the time: the King’s secret investment
is in robots, shades of RUR and Karel
Capek’s mechanical men. This, in turn,
one imagines, carries a good bit of
symbolic significance. As the drunken
robot gets out of control and doffs his
arm with his hat, so do humans frus-
trate their Maker —and a wet bathing-
suit Martha’s plot.
There is also something Hoffman-
esque in the whole setting from the
moment shortsighted Franz arrives in
the big city to present his credentials.
The world swirls in a golden blur, but
only because he has trodden on his
sole pair of spectacles. And his land-
lord, too, belongs in this distorted
universe of monster-makers; he thinks
he has created everyone from the
shawled mophead on the sofa he calls
his wife to Franz and Martha making
love in his upstairs room. (A word of
warning to “Dr. Joy”-riders: Nabokov’s
feud with the Viennese-wooders had
begun and he sportingly points out
that there are plenty of—baited?—traps
for Freudians.)
Above all, it is the sheer mocking
robust vitality of the writing that gets
you. When the curtain falls on the
hysterical laughter of a reprieved Franz,
he is only giving full voice to the mirth
that has been thundering away in the
wings all the time. Perhaps, in the end,
all that divides the 20-year-old Nabokov
from the 60-year-old is the exact quality
of this laughter: then, in the superb
arrogance of youth, he isolated himself
from his pawns; now he has joined
them—he laughs not only with them
and at them, but also at himself.
REMORSELESS DETAIL
By NANCY KEESING
Charco Harbour. Godfrey Blunden.
Weidenfeld & Nicholson. $5.35.
BLUNDEN SPENT four years in
research for this long and close-packed
novel of Captain Cook’s first voyage to
Australia and some of his investigations
were in little-used sources. Unfortun-
ately the book does not disclose where
fact is separated from fiction, so that an
adequate assessment of its contribution
to knowledge is difficult; yet one can-
not regard “Charco Harbour” purely in
terms of a novel, because it is circum-
scribed by its terms of reference.
Some history is conjectural, and his-
torical novelists like Mary Renault
can, while re-creating a period within
flexible limits, also succeed in creating
a valid world in which they are free
to refashion or even truly to create
characters. There is little of conjecture
about the Endeavour’s expedition. The
scientists aboard and the Captain him-
self made copious journals, diaries,
drawings, logs, letters, and official
reports to attest it. A novelist will have
few facts which can validly be twisted
and, if he is as serious as ’Godfrey
Blunden, he will not be able to intro-
duce major characters.
Blunden has attacked his problems in
three ways. He has (one must assume as
a result of research discoveries) given
a slant to the character of Joseph Banks
which is very different from the conven-
tional view. Perhaps the worst fault of
“Charco Harbour” is the absence of
any note or explanation to justify its
distasteful portrait of Joseph Banks.
Next Blunden has magnified a mystery
which has never been solved beyond
dispute into proportions capable of
pivoting a plot; the mystery is: who
lopped drunken Orton’s ears? Thirdly,
he makes the semi-mutinous rumblings,


complaints, wild plans, and wild pas-
sions of the seamen into a chorus
he does this very well, indeed, and the
“chorus” selections are among the
novel’s strengths legitimate fictional
devices to lift the story out of its pas-
sages of .stodginess.
Blunden makes no concessions to the
squeamish in describing life aboard the
Endeavour during the slow sail up
the eastern coast, the anxious negotia-
tion of the Barrier Reef, the time ashore
at the mouth of the Endeavour River
(the “Charco Harbour” of the book).
The times and situation dictated their
own necessities dreadful punishments
(how else to quell constant potential
mutiny?); for the Captain absolute and
virtually unshared responsibility; a hell’s
brew of intrigue, vice, illness, semi-
starvation and the insecurities of ignor-
ance below decks. When even the muti-
lating sexual operations of Queensland’s
coastal Aborigines are relentlessly and
thoroughly described, it follows that
each morsel of flesh flying from a
whipped back, each torment of defici-
ency disease will be accounted for.
“Charco Harbour” is not easy reading,
because of its remorseless detail even
to J< ■ ph Banks’ great-grandfather’s
will! Readers who do tackle it and
the effort has its rewards may decide
between now and 1970 to attack some
of the expected spate of “Cook books,”
especially republished authentic material
such as Sir Archibald Grenfell Price’s
“The Explorations of Captain James
Cook in the Pacific,” which consists of
excerpts from diaries with excellent
running commentary.
While the eventual placing of
“Charco Harbour” in the bicentenary
stakes remains to be seen, the question
it poses really is: was the presentation
of this material in fictional form the best
course?
A TENANT 'S PRAYER
Blood bowels liver lights
stay awake my lazy nights.
Chords always strung to speak
don’t demand a five-day week.
Please tight two-way tent of skin
keep cold rain out hot blood in.
Nerve-ends however I complain
send me still your wires of pain.
Tongue though you never learn
Chinese
tell me the truth of wine and cheese.
Knee-cap elbow spine and wrist
silently continue to co-exist.
Though I cut you beard hair nails
leave your revenge till my heart fails.
And you old friend when down she
lies
never forget a man should rise.

SUMMER STIMULUS
FOR
JADED APPETITES
WE HAD 14 to lunch the other Sun-
day to one of our barbecues and
to my certain knowledge every one of
them had been out to meals the two
previous days.
My own appetite was feeling some-
what jaded, and what we needed was
something piquant to give us all a
renewed interest in eating.
What, I thought, am I going to give
them to start with? I sat with pencil
poised and a blank sheet of paper in
front of me. (I am a great list-maker;
I write ideas down, make a shopping
list to accompany the menu, and then
scratch it out and start again.)
What made matters worse was that
I was feeling somewhat tired. Late
nights and early mornings don’t encour-
age my imagination.
That, I thought, is exactly what many
readers may be feeling like over the
Christmas and New Year party season
tired and full of food.
It was then that I was struck with
the idea: Gazpacho for the first course
cold, piquant, and very appetising.
“Just because we like it,” said my
husband, “doesn’t mean that everyone
will eat cold soup.” In that case, I
replied very firmly, they don’t have
to eat it.
Two tins (15oz. Edgell, I bought) of
peeled and seeded tomatoes. (You can
save money, if not exactly time, by
purchasing about 16 large tomatoes,
peeling and seeding them.) One large
cucumber, half a bunch of shallots,
two large green capsicums.
Early in the morning I peeled six
cloves of garlic and put them in the
blender with one tablespoon of salt,
one tablespoon of sugar, two tablespoons
of paprika, six tablespoons of olive oil,
two tablespoons of vinegar, and a little
cayenne pepper.
I put the blender on high speed for
a couple of seconds until the contents
were thick, then added the tinned
tomatoes and whirred some more until
it was thick and gluggy, added a couple
of dashes of tabasco, and put the mix-
ture into the refrigerator.
Then I prepared six cups of chicken
broth (with Maggi cubes, in this case),
peeled and finely chopped the cucum-
ber, and added both to the bowl in the
refrigerator.
Next, I chopped the capsicums into
cubes and about a dozen shallots into
thin slices, and stored both in individual
bowls covered with “Gladwrap.” All that
was left to do was make some garlic
bread, which could later be heated in
the oven to accompany the soup.
To serve, you place a large ice cube
in the bottom of each soup bowl, pour
over sufficient soup to fill up, and
pass the capsicum and shallots for
guests to sprinkle on top. Our guests
were a motley lot (six nationalities),
and every one of them thought it was
delicious.
Gazpacho Andaluz as written above is
a sophisticated soup. There are lots of
versions. Some of them, made by the
poorest peasants, are basically garlic,
breadcrumbs, oil, vinegar, and water—
but this one I think you’ll like the
best.
Another of my favorite summer soups
is cold borsch and it looks so
appetising, all pink and cool, that the
very nicest way to serve it is in plain
glass bowls.
For a dozen people you will need six
beetroot. (To save time I cheat and
buy them in tins.) Into a large saucepan
put four pints of water, two cloves of
garlic, half a bunch of chopped celery,
one large chopped onion, and two
tomatoes. Bring to the boil with two
tablespoons of red wine vinegar, two
teaspoons of salt, and three tablespoons
of sugar. Boil this until the contents are
soft and mushy. (If using tinned beet
this won’t take long.) Place in blender
until pureed. While still warm, add
three tablespoons of lemon juice and
the beaten yolks of three eggs. Pour
into a bowl and place in refrigerator.
Before serving, stir in one carton of
sour cream, blend, and then pour into
individual serving bowls. Garnish with
chopped chives or slices of cucumber
dusted with finely chopped parsley.
Serve, of course, with hot garlic bread.
Cold fruit soups are very popular in
European countries, but I have rarely
seen them on the menu here, where the
climate is so ideal for this delicious
way of starting a meal.
Fruit soups can be made of almost
any fruit; all you need is a little
imagination with the spices. The fruit
is cooked until soft with lemon juice
and spices of your choice, then
thickened with cornflour, chilled, and
served with sour cream.
If you are game to try, possibly the
best beginning is a soup my mother
used to serve on summer evenings. For
six people you will need lib. of dark
cherries. Stone them and bring them
to the boil in two pints of water with
a small stick of cinnamon, three whole
cloves, and 6oz. of sugar.
When the cherries are tender, remove
the spices; then thicken half a bottle of
red wine with three tablespoons of
cornflour. Add the grated rind of half
a lemon and the juice of a whole lemon.
Stir into the hot cherry liquid and
bring to the boil once more.
Cool, and store in the refrigerator
until required. Serve with a spoonful
of sour cream and decorate the float
u'ith a sprig of mint.
This, I hasten to add, can also be
a good dessert. But why not try it the
other way round for a change? Once
having done so, I think you will become
a confirmed sipper of cold summer
soups.

The Fraser coup
I hardly recognised myself from the
description given in “Canberra—The
Fraser Coup” (8., November 9), which
referred to my recent selection as the
ALP candidate for the A.C.T. Federal
seat as an organised Left-wing coup.
According to your correspondent I am
an opponent of State Aid, prefer Cairns
to Whitlam, would go through ideologi-
cal rituals of denouncing the Americans,
and couldn’t care less about local issues
or citizen problems.
Adding piquancy to the new Walsh
image and organised coup theory, your
correspondent then relates an amusing
fairytale alleging that I am somehow
linked with a struggle to take over the
ACOA to affiliate this Public Service
union with the ALP in order to finance
a separate and independent branch of
the ALP in Canberra. A simple check
would have revealed that, as far as the
ACOA is concerned, it is constitution-
ally impossible for that body to affiliate
with any political organisation.
Regarding State Aid, I support fully
ALP policy on this issue. As for any
preference to Cairns or Whitlam, I
admire and respect both men, and
should I have a vote on the leadership
issue, only at that point of time would
I make a deliberate and quite personal
judgment of their respective qualities,
or, for that matter, on anyone who
might nominate. Concerning the impli-
cation that if I were elected to Parlia-
ment, local issues and citizen problems
would be neglected, your correspondent
must be aware, but does not mention,
that I have served as an elected ALP
member on the A.C.T. Advisory Coun-
cil continuously since 1964. This council
deals entirely with local issues and prob-
lems; during the past four years it has
been my public task to speak for the
ALP on these issues and assist citizens
with their problems. In addition, I
serve on and assist many local com-
munity organisations.

Art Encyclopedia
While fully acknowledging the
sympathetic tenor of Mr. Elwyn Lynn’s
review (8., November 23) of my
recently published “Encyclopedia of
Australian Art” and having no wish to
quarrel with any fair and relevant
criticism, I would nevertheless like to
draw attention to a few points which
might mislead some readers. For
example the criteria for determining
the inclusion of individual artists is
brought under fire, but a careful con-
sideration of the complex nature of
encyclopedia compilation must surely
reveal that some sort of criteria is
absolutely necessary if the sheer weight
of material is not to overwhelm the
work, and that once applied such
criteria must be carefully observed.
In fact, this criteria was kept as
broad and _ uncritical as possible in
accordance with the aim of providing a
compendium of facts designed to serve
the public as well as artists, art adminis-
trators, connoisseurs, and students. I
do not agree with Mr. Lynn that the
listing of the winners of art prizes
“does not give much chance to the anti-
prize artist and loner”; no one is quoted
as having suffered in this way and
indeed I think any such person would
be hard to name. If there are winners
of prizes whose work is of little worth
this is the responsibility of judges; since
1947 the judges of the Albury prize
(the one specifically mentioned by
your reviewer) have ranged from Sir
Daryl Lindsay, 1947, and Mr. James
Quinn, 1948, to Mr. John Perceval and
Mr. J. A. Tuckson, in 1965, 1968, and
it should be conceded that all are
capable of making responsible
decisions. The importance of art prizes
•to the Australian art economy and
development is obvious enough, and
indeed Mr. Lynn himself is listed in the
book as having won thirteen prizes.
He, goes on to discuss the omission
of present-day cartoonists from the
article on Black and White Art in
Australia, but a careful reading of this
shows that it deals with a specific school,
whose influence virtually came to an
end in the 19405. Finally, the comment
on critics,' and my possible remarks at
the seminar on criticism held in Sydney
early this year, is irrelevant to the
review of the book. Some young critics
and artists, like some galleries, are not
in the book simply because they
appeared too late on the scene . for
possible inclusion. Alterations and addi-
tions are costly in book production,
and, like other encyclopedists, I had
strongly to resist the temptation to
keep the work completely up to date.

More Vietnam
I smiled sadly at Mr. M. J. McKenzie’s
letter (8., Nov. 30) telling us he feels
sadness and pity about the war, and
not the “violence and hatred” he says
Mr. X. Learoy (8., Nov. 9) must feel.
But then, predictably, he goes on
to announce that “When the Mr. Lea-
roys of this world have gone to their
just deserts” wars and violence will be
over. “Just deserts?” Doesn’t sound like
sadness and pity to me.
From where I’m standing, when the
Mr. McKenzies of this world have gone
to their just deserts . . . and so on
and so on.
Round we go again, folks. Pick your
partners for another game of “I’m Not
Angry He Is.”
