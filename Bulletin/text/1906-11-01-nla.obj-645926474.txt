CORBELLI— AND THE BULL-AEIFERS
At last ! The great, dumb, dog-eyed,
hungering public may now study the authen-
tic portrait of Marie Corelli. It is given
away with that author’s latest book. True,
you have to buy the book.
By special request of her publishers—
Constable’s, the publishers of George Mere-
dith—this rotund little woman, elaborately
adorned, with her small-eyed, round face
and her chubby, pendant hands, decorates
her new volume. The prelude, in which
she describes the genesis of the por-
trait, is of absorbing dramatic interest.
Corelli naively makes it clear that the
frontispiece “has nothing to do with the
story, beyond being a faithful likeness of the
author.’ Hence her chastened reluctance
and tempered inability to convince herself
that her “ pictured personality ” can have
any interest for her readers. But circum-
stances darkly conspired. “ Certain ‘lower’
sections of the pictorial press,” it dreadfully
appears, had striven to alienate her readers
from her by the free and unwarrantable cir-
culation of “various gross and, I think I
may say, libellous, fictitious misrepresen-
tations of me.” In order, thus, to pre-
vent any further misleading of the public
by fraudulent inventions (how the lan-
guage of the patent medicine advertise-
ments will creep in !), it appeared advisable
to her publishers (0, wily Constable, pub-
lisher of Meredith !) to place upon the
market this * ‘ authentic likeness of myself as
I truly am to-day.”
But cafci a successful novelist trust the
camera to tell the truth '! Might not the
photographer be in league with the critics '!
Ha ! We shall go to the studio secretly, darkly
masquerading under some undistinguished
name. Thus the public, so long imposed
upon, may rest assured that it now possesses
the only genuine Corelli on the market.
Her features, so we are informed, have been
treated with no more care than those of any
ordinary stranger ; and, in conclusion, “no
portraits resembling me in any way are
published anywhere, and invented sketches,
purporting to pass as true likenesses of me,
are merely attempts to obtain money from
the public on false pretences.” The public
is fairly warned.
J*
Let us consider Corelli, how her novels
grow. The average woman regards Corelli
as the champion of her sex, martyred by
masculine spite ; really she is a pathetic
victim of male indifference. Woman also
points to her as the one book-worm that has
triumphantly turned. As a matter of fact,
Corelli is a worm that learnt to turn long
before she learnt to crawl ; and she has been
so busy turning ever since that she has not
got very many worm’s lengths along the
literary road. A id, after all, Corelli,
judged 'by her latest, The Treasure of
Heaven , is not so bad. She is no
more dull, no more conventional, no
more slip-shod, no more padded, no more
unconvincing than a dozen other popular
novels that the reckless reader picks up from
a bookstall. There is really nothing to be
frightened about now ; Corelli is quite tame
—as tame as her “bull-heifers” in The
Treasure of Heaven.
After school hours I got an evening job of a shil-
ling a week for bringing home eight Highland
bull-heifers from pasture. The man who owned
them valued them highly, but was afraid of them—
wouldn’t go near them for his life—(No more would
we.!)—and before I’d been with them for a week
they all knew me. I was only a wee laddie, but
they answered to my call like friendly dogs rather
than the great, powerful, splendid beasts they
were, with their rough coats shining like floss silk
in the sunset, when I had to drive them- home,
singingas I came. And my father said to me one
night: “Laddie, tell me the truth—are ye ever
scared at the bulls?” “No father!” said I.
“It's a bonny boy lam to the bulls ! ” And he
laughed—by Jove ! —how he laughed !
How does Corelli do it ? How can she
keep on doing it ? How can she invent these
great, powerful, splendid beasts—eight of
them !—and yet survive ? The answer is
perhaps supplied by. one of her characters :
“ Courage and self-reliance have often con-
quered more than eight bulls ! ” Corelli has
self-reliance—and brains. Let no male dis-
parage her brains. Many a writer gauges
accurately what the public wants, but there
are only two, Corelli and Hall Caine, who
can deliver the goods. And Corelli, with
something of the magnificent carelessness of
Shakespeare, throws her eight bull-heifers in.
Corelli knows her business ; with a mind
that is just a little above the average mind,
and a fluent gift for words, she has no diffi-
culty in finding her audience. It is no
question of writing down ; Corelli merely
writes herself—one of the vast average of
dull brains, with a gift of voicing the dumb
beliefs and cloudy aspirations of that
enormous mob. The mob is dull, and,
like the eight bull-heifers, needs gentle
leading ; .and Corelli is careful not to
startle any of them. She is as conventional,
as vapid, as humorless, as unreal, as tawdry,
as the dullest intelligence could desire.
She knows that her audience does not like
surprises ; therefore she tells them the plot
in the opening chapters, and the gentle bull-
heifers follow meekly to the inevitable
“ happy ending.” Thus the interest in the
yarn is diluted down to a vague wonder when
it is going to end. Corelli’s customers like
full value for their money ; she gives them
5(54 pages (with portrait). A mere ten pages
are taken up with a storm, while chapters
are devoted to one middle-aged proposal.
The breathless suspense is ended only by
the hero overhearing the heroine “murmur-
ing plaintively ” as she is about to cast her-
self from a “ dizzy height ” into the sea :
“ I wish I did not love him so dearly ! I wish
I could stay—but 1 must go! You are so deep
and cruel, you sea ! —you have drowned so many
bra ve men She swayed towards the brink—
one second more—and then with a swift, strong
clasp and passionate cry Angus had caught her in
his arms.
But moments like these are rare. Leisurely,
like the laddie singing the floss-silk bull-
heifers home, Corelli meanders on ; every
dawn is dignified with its little paragraph,
every wild flower adorned with its modest
phrase. Sometimes, when she is up too
late to describe the dawn, she remarks :
“ However, day after day passed, and
nothing happened.”
Corelli is fortunate in possessing all the
conventional likes and dislikes ; she is one
with her bull-heifers in her distrust of the
humorous. (Calling the High Church “ High
Jinks ” is a lapse that might happen to any
careless popular author.) The tired mob she
brings home at sunset gets through life
with a small vocabulary composed largely
of ready-made phrases, and Corelli con-
tinually tickles them with quotations from
the fewauthors whose names they have heard.
(“That is Tennyson,” she said. “Yes—
that is Tennyson—the last great poet Eng-
land can boast,” he answered.) And she
has many a good word for—and many a good
phrase from—the Bible. Consider the sell-
ing value of her ti tles — Satan . . . God . . .
Bar abbas . . . Heaven —to none of these does
the bull-heifer need an introduction. But
there are no epigrams—Corelli is too clever
for that!
And Corelli leaves nothing out. Every
topic of the day is dragged in to beguile the
bull-heifers home. Carnegie, newspaper
syndicates, “High Jinks” (“And the
churches ! —my God ! —as Madame Roland
said of Liberty—what crimes are com-
mitted in Thy Name ! ”), motors, critics,
female suffrage, smart society—the chamber
of horrors is joyously crammed. And,
finally, Marie is very, very moral. Bull-
heifers like morality—in books. The rich
are always sinful, the poor invariably godly ;
and at the end of the story every moral
character in the book gets a little legacy
from the millionaire’s will.
But still we fail to put the finger on the
reason of Marie Corelli. Ah ! we have it
now, in the words of her ’ Gentle Good
Journalist, “I never wrote a line that I
thought might cause uneasiness in the minds
of the million.” Even that is not all; the
young author who yearns to write a Success-
ful Novel needs one thing more—she must
have first written The Sorrows of the Mighty
Atom and God's Good Barabbas. It is a
bonny boy Corelli has always been to the
bull-heifers !

advertisement of his new business. The critic
turned bookseller has the courage of his convic-
tions ; so long occupied in telling Australia what
books to buy, the critic is now prepared to sell

THE OURSE OF LITERATURE
AUSTRALIA has just entered into an era
of great industrial development. It is
at the-present moment in the throes of a
moral outburst. With' both these move-
ments, the subject of the fine arts—especially
literature—is inextricably entangled. Yet neither
the statesmen, the patriots, nor the 1 untans have
spoken one word alxnit the incubus of hteiatuie,
which lies indigestible on the chest of this amt.
every other country.
So hardened have people become to the presence
of literature that, in some cases, it is even regarded
as something to be proud of, and towns and dis-
tricts are occasionally found rejoicing over the
possession of a poet, much as the Spartans revered
their most dexterous thief. Clergymen with a
perverted sense of morality promote what are
calk'd literary societies, and people shamelessly
encourage vicious schoolmasters to misdirect the
tastes of innocent children towards this mighty
vice. Bespectable newspapers, not content with
printing reports of race meetings and the results
of Tattersall’s consultations, devote columns a
week to the support of this gigantic evil, and
many are found arguing, week in and week out,
for the development of an Australian brand of
literature.
J*
Why should Australia have a literature?
Neither to Australia nor to any other land is
literature essential. Literature si in ply means the
withdrawal of a number of able-bodied men and
women from the producing power <)f the com-
munity, in order that they may write things for
other people to read. It is the story of the com-
munity in which people eked out a precarious
livelihood by taking in one another’s washing;
only the people did something useful when they
washed clothes, while the literary man merely
disfigures clean paper, and a lot of fools pay
for the pleasure of gaping at him as he does so.
Exclusive of technical handbooks and—insofar
as they assist in the peace, order, and good
government of the community—historical works,
the country would be the better were the writing,
as well a$ the making, of hooks made a criminal
offence. In a properly balanced community, per-
sons reading for any purposes hut those of improv-
ing their knowledge now to increase the means of
production, would be liable to fine and imprison-
ment. The possession of a pen, pencil, marking-
stick, ink-bottle or other instrument of writing
would be deemed proof of intention to write a
book, and the onus of proving innocence would lie
with the defendant. All letters would have
to he written in telegraph-offices under super-
vision, and persons loitering therein would be
guilty of a misdemeanor. By such means, the
vicious tendency towards literature might, in a few
years, be stamped out. Libraries would cease to
exist ; or, if a few still contrived to maintain a
surreptitious existence, they would be carried on
at the back of wood-yards and tea-shops, and an
energetic police force would make periodical raids
and send in spies to swear at subsequent prosecu-
tions how they had found the prisoners reading
Wordsworth or The Review of Renews.
The aim of the country should be io make one
blade of grass grow where none grows now, and to
utilise every contrivance which will enable every
workman to double his productivity. Anything
that interferes with this ideal should be rigorously
suppressed, and this literature undoubtedly does,
first, by reducing the number of effective pro-
ducers; second, by causing another and larger
section to be engaged in the useless labor of pro-
ducing, distributing, and criticising the work of
the first class ; and, third, by diverting the atten-
tion of readers from channels which would lead to
the general welfare. What marvellous results
might have been attained had the misguided
persons who applied their inventive genius to the
construction of that vicious instrument, the lino-
type, spent the same time in working out a
machine for plastering walls or clearing timbered
country !
Like other members of the- criminal and non-
producing classes, persons suspected of literature
have always striven to perpetuate the system
under which they prospered and, like good busi-
ness men, have devoted a .portion of their time to
advertising. A world, dulled into leaden indif-
ference by the opium of literature, Has lazily
accented what they said as truth, with the result
that people generally regard literature as some-
thing almost commendable. In all probability,
had the persons who live by drink and gambling
applied themselves as pertinaciously to the same
object, the world to-day would firmly believe that
drink and gambling are two main factors that
make for greatness. As it is, while believing
that the man who lays the bricks is nobler than
the man who lays the odds, it declines to admit
that the man who makes a boot is a better'man
than he who makes an epigram.
The crime of literature dates back to the
beginning of things. Even the great philoso-
phers—being themselves in the game—have taken
care never to give themselves away and point out
the economic unsoundness of book-writing. The
burning of the library at Alexandria has been
held up as a world-calamity, hut not one
person has had the temerity to contend
that the world would have been richer
by one billy-can or one cabbage had that
overrated collection of spoiled sheepskin been
doused out by an efficient fire brigade. The
possession of Shakespeare’s works to-day does not
add a cubit to the stature of the race nor a penny
to the world’s wealth, and were they all destroyed
to-morrow, the industrial assets of the world would
remain undiminished. Shakspeare, the poacher,
at any rate justified his existence. He put in
useful labor in chasing and killing deer for
his own consumption. Though acting in defiance
of the law and individually injurin'g the owner of
the deer, he wascontributing directly to the wealth
of the community. Shakspeare, the poet, was an
economic spieler. He voluntarily withdrew his
labor from the general producing power of
England. He was a deserter from the industrial
army, and the laborious hours he put in turning
out useless plays is no atonement for his offence.
There is more excuse for Homer, seeing that he
was blind. But, under an intelligent system of
administration, he would have spent his time
usefully in making doormats and blaeking-
brushes. ’•
J*
Literature, of course, is not alone in its perni-
cious effects on the body politic. All fine art —
whether literature, painting, sculpture, or
pugilism—comes under the same category. The
surprising thing is that the world allows itself to
be gulled so long with these palpable frauds.
Liter iture, painting, music, and drama profess to
describe certain events, or interpret certain
emotions. Any man with the amount of observa-
tion or feeling necessary to derive any gratifica-
tion from these reflections, may see or feel
emotions for himself, without the intervention of
a middleman. A Borneo, who prefers the spurious
emotions of a stage Juliet to the liberal assortment
of emotions a nice Juliet of his own can supply
him with, is in the last stage of degeneration.
Still, the victim of the literary confidence man
persists in paying a guinea a year to the circulat-
ing library that he may he delivered second-hand
goods and emotions that have already been pawed
over by other souls. He does this partly because
it is the fashion ; partly because he plumes him-
self that, by encouraging literature, he is superior
to the man next door who plays golf, or the man
opposite whose hobby is Indian Bunner ducks ;
but, principally, because his brains have been
addled by the subtle narcotics administered by
those literary thugs of all ages,.who drug their
victims that they may be more easily flgeced.
So far from encouraging Australia to look for
more literary men, it would be well for some anti-
literature Judkins to arise and conduct a crusade
to nip the evil now. Calmly considered, the
drink and gambling habits are but small things
to the literary habit, both in extent and viru-
lence. Australia has already more than its fairshare
of writers, artists, orators, and similar parasites.
There is little to be done in the way of conversion.
Literary men are invariably mercenary, grasping
creatures, not amenable to discipline of any
sort, and just as incapable of understanding
kindly treatment as other instinctive criminals.
All they recognise is force, and they must be
compelled to become producers and factors in the
general welfare of the country by contributing
their share to its aggregate wealth. This is only
to be accomplished by educating the public to a
full knowledge of the facts, and, should this not
prove effective, by repressive legislation.
As fleas have smaller fleas to bite ’em, so
literary men have developed other literary men
who write about their work and call themselves
critics, and like all parasites they do not risk the
loss of their billet by biting too hard. It is a
curious commentary on a civilisation, supposed to
be run on business lines, that good money is paid
away to people to write about the way that some-
body else has written about something. Perhaps
the most extraordinary position of all is that
people are to be found to read and pay for such
articles as these —or ttys.
C.N.
Literature is herewith solemnly abolished, and
“C.N.,” being warned in time, should at once
melt his typewriter into a ploughshare. He and
Literature, hand in hand, are duly hurled out into
a bleak world, where they must learn to make two
furrows where there was but one before.

The N.S.W. Bookstall Co. has locally pro-
duced a series of colored calendars and booklets
for the delectation of friends abroad. The series
includes “ Gems from Australian Poets”—tiny,
four-lined gems, that modestly blink at their vivid
setting—and pictures of Australian wildflowers,
birds, and scenery. The whole of the work is
locally done; but the manner of the color work is
not distinctively Australian. As technical speci-
mens of the Australian printer’s art, however, the
series is to be commended, and the productions,
as Christmas souvenirs, will serve a patriotic pur-
pose.
The September issue of the Scientific Australian,
which is now a 12-year-old publication, deals
apecially with the matter of suction gas plants,
and the need for encouraging the use of suction
gas in this country. Capt. Cresswell, as the
representative expert advocate of an Australian
Navy, a biographical sketch in the little
journal, which is also primed with information re
cold storage and “summer ice,” cement concrete
pipes, the new Melbourne electric tramway, and
the application of electricity in various other
directions. The Scientific Australian grows more
interesting with every issue.
To meet the special needs of Australian rail-
ways, William Orlando Bagley (with portrait-
no Australian book is genuine without what
Marie Corelli terms the “ portrayed presentment
of mere physiognomy”) supplies another “felt
want ” in his Locomotive Engine Drivers' Guide
(Melb. Arbuckle, Warded and Fawckner, 7s. 6d.).
There would be no accidents on our railways if
every fireman and engine-driver knew his Or-
lando.
Modestly filling its little niche comes Rifle
Sketches, by Arthur G. Leslie (G. Bobertson and
Co.; Is.), a collection of enthusiastic articles in
praise and elucidation of the art of rifle shooting,
interspersed with short stories, of whose value as
literature neither Arthur G. Leslie (with portrait)
nor the critic has any exalted opinion. But to
every rifleman in the Commonwealth this gossipy
and instructive little paper cover can be com-
mended.
Byron’s grandson, the Earl of Lovelace, who
held many of the headstrong characteristics of
his Gordon breed, has died at the age of 67. His
father married Byron’s only daughter Ada, and
he himself has left a daughter Ada to continue
the poet’s line.
Morriso* Davidson hails anew B B. Cunning-
hame Graham as “Bobertus Bex Britanniaruin
Primus et Scotise Quartus.” Graham is direct
descendant of James I of Scotland, and dc jure
successor to the Stuart kingdom. And indeed,
with his social sympathies, he would make as gay
and beneficent a monarch as he of Yvetot.

Proofs and Testimonies which, show
how Men have been Cured of
Deadly Diseases, and who now
enjoy Life’s pleasures fully. How
Good Health and True Happiness
have been restored, and Sick Men
Made Well and Strong 1 by the
freeman & Wallace Specialists.
Good health and physical strength is the
medium to the best and truest happiness
that life holds. Without either, a man’s
mission in life is unfulfilled. Without strength
a man is virtually ignored by both sexes, for
he fails in the one chief attribute that makes
him a nian. A weak and museularly unde-
veloped man receives the pity of his comrades,
but the strong and healthy man compels alike
the admiration of women and of men.
Many men lose their strength before they
reach their prime by excesses of various kinds,
over-taxing of the nerve and physical sys-
tems, privation and disease. The latter may
result from various causes, and may affect the
vital centres in such a way that, unless
disease and wasting is checked by those able
by special knowledge and methods of cure,
entire and permanent ruin of the vital organs
may result.
The testimonies and portraits that appear
here are from men well-known in the Aus-
tralian professional and social world, and will
prove to the reader the efficacy of the wonder-
ful curative properties of the Electro-Medical
treatment of the Specialists of the Freeman
and Wallace Institute, of Elizabeth and
Bathurst-streets, Sydney, who never fail to
cure the most obstinate case they may take in
hand. They give a written guarantee to cure
in all cases undertaken, and the Physician-in-
Ohief, Dr. Wallace, L.R.0.5., E., L.11,C.P.,
F., L.M., is one of a Staff of Four Qualified
Specialists in attendance at the Institute. All
letters sent to this distinguished Physician,
who is registered by Australian and English
Medical Boards, are personally supervised by
him, and replied to with that necessary
punctuality a perfect postal medical practice
ensures.
A Salvation Army Treasurer
Testifies.
The first testimony we present to the reader
is from the pen of Mr. Thomas J. Smith, late
Sergeant-Major, now Treasurer, Salvation
Army Barracks, Prahran, Melbourne. Mr.
ĥ
Smith
has testi-
fied some
thous-
ands of
tim e s
in the
Army
ring for
the bene-
fit of the
m oral
and phy-
sical wel-
f a r e of
men, and
no w he
testifies
to his
restora-
tion t o
health
at the
hands of
ethe Fre-
man and Wallace Specialists. This testimony
is straight to the point, honest, and con-
vincing, and should be a guide to all suffering
men.
Gentlemen : —For twelve years I have been
an acute sufferer, afflicted with melancholia,
liver troubles, and, at times, excruciating
pains in back and limbs. On visiting your In-
stitute, my case was investigated by the
senior resident physician. I was prevailed
upon to place myself under his treatment,
with the result that I am now cured, and may
be regarded as, at my time of life, a new man.
The liver and kidneys are acting naturally
and satisfactorily. I willingly make the fore-
going statement, hoping that others who may
be afflicted similarly to myself will be induced
to seek your skilful professional services.
(Signed) Thomas J. Smith.
A Great Cycling Athlete Testifies.
No man is better known in the world of
athletics than Mr. Joseph Megson, a Cham-
pion Cyclist of New South Wales. Recently
he became quite run down, and consulted the
-*«
Specialists
of our Insti-
tute, under-
going for
a time a
system of
Health cul-
ture at their
hands. He
regained his
lost strength
and vigor,
and says of
their treat
ment: —
“I suf-
fered from
Nervous-
ness for a
longtime. I
was on the
point of a
constitu-
tional break up more than once. The merits of
your treatment are beyond question.”
(Signed) JOSEPH MEGSON.
Mr. Megson has for some time been figuring
largely in athletic circles, and his testimony
should prove of considerable value to others,
and instruct them how they may regain
health and strength if necessary.
Mr. J. I«. Ceiling's, of Burbanks, West
Australia, writes thus :
‘• I am glad to say that I do not need any
more medicine, for I am now in the best of
health ; in fact, I was never better in my life
before. lam going to be married early next
month, and am not a bit afraid of my health
giving way. If ever I can recommend your
treatment to others suffering as I have done,
most certainly I will do so.”
The World’s Champion Sculler
Speaks.
No less a brilliant athlete than Mr.
GEORGE TOWNS, the World’s Champion
Sculler, and who is matched to row Durnan,
of America, on the Parramatta, shortly,
speaks of the Freeman and Wallace Specialists
skill. The splendid story, how Towns fought
ħ
h
way
u p wards
to his now
famous
position,
from one
of stern
necessity,
by force
of char-
acter, de-
termina-
tion, and
skill, is
well
k now n.
The man
who sho-
veiled
his coal
in th e
stokehole
of an
ocean
liner in
order to
reach
England to grasp the victor’s oars, is proved
to be of that grit of which famous men are
made. Run down in health by excessive
training, shattered in nerves, he recouped his
strength and health by the Electro-Medical
treatment of the Freeman and Wallace
Specialists, and almost at the same time
defeated Stanbury. Towns testifies thus :
Messrs. Freeman and Wallace.
“Through arduous training I became run
down in health and strength, and was ad vised
to consult you. I underwent a course of your
Electro-Medical treatment, and used your
electric battery. I soon felt better, and con-
fident that I could stand any strain. Your
batteries are the best I ever used.”
(Signed) George Towns.
A Melbourne Commercial Man says:
Mr. F. Barker (Messrs. Barker Bros.,
262 Victoria-street, Richmond, Melbourne)
has reason to congratulate himself for his visit
to the Institute’s Chief Physician, Br. Wal-
lace, early this year. His condition was most
ĥ
despe-
rate, the
blood
bei n g
affected
gravely,
and only
skilful
an d ef-
fective
treat-
me n t
saved
him from
early
d e a t 1).
He had
been
under
several
m ed ical
men un-
s u c cess-
fully,
and was
still becoming worse. He was ultimately-
cured by Dr. Wallace, which shows the truth
of the Specialist’s assertions that, however
bad the case they accept for treatment, they
guarantee to cure, and do cure it. Mr. Barker
tells his story, under date February 10,
1906
Messrs. Freeman and Wallace.
“I desire to express my gratitude to you
with the results of you specialistic treatment.
I was afflicted very gravely, my blood being
out of order, and my entire body affected.
Treatment at the hands of two well-known
doctors failed to do me any good. I was
persuaded to consult you, and so undergo a
course of treatment. The results have grati-
fied me almost beyond expression. lam now
rescued to one of sound health. I hope this
letter may be the means of saving others from
dreadful diseases that tend to rum the health
and strength.”
(Signed) F. Barker.
A Victorian. Pastoralist writes:
Mr. George Simpson is a man well-known
in pastoral circles in Mullawarre. Out in the
great Victorian farms and sheep runs, in all
winds and weathers, a man runs a great risk
ħ
of faying
thefoun-
dation of
a disease
which
will eat
out the
vital
forces of
Nature
and ulti-
mately
kill. Mr.
Simpson
was for
some
time un-
der treat-
ment of
the Free-
man and
W allace
Special-
ists, but
was ulti-
mately
cured. He concluded a very interesting letter
concerning his recovery recently, thus :
“I consider that you have restored me to
perfect health and strength from a condition
of Nerve Weakness and general debility. I
am now in splendid health.”
(Signed) George Simpson.
The Treatment of Diseases of Men calls
for Special Skill and Remedies. The
Testimonies quoted prove the Skill of
the Freeman and Wallace Specialists,
Sydney, in the Rapid and Certain Cure
of Diseases to which Men are liable.
The Specialists’ Great Practice and
Reliable Methods recommend them.
You are invited to read these copies of testimonies received by us among
hundreds of others, and are at liberty to make personal inquiries from the attestants
as to the efficacy of our ELECTRO-MEDICAL treatment. These testimonies are
given by citizens of standing and repute, and it is certain that these people would
think well before giving such testimonies. THE FREEMAN AND WALLACE
INSTITUTE has, per the medium of cures effected, become widely known through-
out the whole of the English-speaking countries of the world, as well as in foreign
lands, and the daily increasing volume of practice proves the actual merit and success
of the treatment adopted during our 35 long years of professional attention to those
suffering from serious specific complaints peculiar to our race. In all cases under-
taken we GUARANTEE a cure, and if we fail to do what we claim we cheerfully
refund the fees paid. We are particularly desirous of taking up cases where flagrant
failure ha* resulted from treatment administered by other specialists or medical prac-
titioners, and we find that, by curing such cases, recommendations to us are freely
made by those whom we have cured. Sufferers from the results of DEBILITY,
LOCAL WEAKNESS, BRAIN-FAG, LOSS OF POWER, YARICOCELE, IN-
SOMNIA, and LACK OF VIGOR, no matter from what cause arising, should con-
sult us, and happy and perfected health will be the direct result of our treatment-
Remember, our cures are PERMANENT, and once cured, the sufferer will remain
for ever in the enjoyment of that vitality and vigor that alone makes life worth living.

If you are suffering from any of the following ailments call at our office
or write at once for full information—
General Debility, Loss of Vigor, Blood or Skin Diseases, Physical
Decay, Sleeplessness, Despondency and Nervous Degeneration.
Our Medical Staff comprises FOUR Legally Qualified Medical Physicians.
Dr. Wallace, Chief Physician, is Registered by Australian and English
Medical Boards. (See Registered Medical Practitioners’ Lists.)
“ Weakness.”
Functional derangements, commonly termed
“ weakness,” are a direct result of inflammation,
enlargement, or excessive sensitiveness of the pr; s-
tate gland, brought on by early dissipation or result-
ing from some improperly treated disorder. This is
a scientific truth that we have ascertained after
careful study and observation in hundreds of cases,
and is a truth upon which our own original system is
based. We treat by local methods exclusively, and
our success in treating even those cases that others
have failed to temporarily relieve with their tonics is
conclusive evidence that our method affords the only
possible means of a complete and radical cure.
Varicocele.
Men who have for .years been afflicted with varico-
cele and who have chosen to suffer the consequences
of neglect rather than submit to the harsh, painful,
and dangerous surgical treatment commonly indulged
in, can come to us with complete assurance that we
will effect a permanent cure by a painless and abso-
lutely harmless method. Our treatn ent involves no
cutting, and it is seldom necessary that the patient
be detained a single day from his business.
Pelvic Troubles.
We cur 1 these troublesome and positively dan-
gerous diseases in but half the usual time required,
thus forestalling' chronic complications. A new and
unique system of treatment that cannot fail to cure
both quickly and thoroughly.
Blood Diseases.
We cure these diseases—cure them thoroughly.
Every symptom vanishes for ever, and the pat ent is
relieved of a mental burden that he has probably
borne for years. Harmless blood-cleansing remedies
only are employed.
We are always willing to oblige in every detail until
a cure is effected.
Our office and operating theatre occupy three floors,
fully equipped and so arranged as to afford all patients
the utmost convenience and privacy.
Inability to come to our office for consultation and
treatment need not deprive you of our services. Our
knowledge of men’s diseases enables us to treat suc-
cessfully at a distance. Write describing your symp-
toms in full, and we will advise you free of charge,
and will tell you whether we can cure you without
your calling in person.
We have published a 750-page medical work, “Clini-
cal Experiences,” 31 chapters, 150 medical plates. It
will be found interesting, instructive and helpful by
all men suffering from special ailments. Write for it.

The Coming.
Beside Joy’s rosy gate,
My lady Spring I wait;
Thro’ the wak’ning wattle .spinning with her
jewelled motor cars,
She comes, with magic key,
To set the old earth free,
And light the dreaming gullies with a million
orchid stars.
King Midas at her side,
They come, the groom and bride,
Their arrows, golden-pointed, pierce each fretful
shadow’s heart;
Wave dark-eyed Sorrow back
From off their gleaming track,
And smash her cup of human tears with swift,
unerring dart.
O winsome is the face
That crowns my lady’s grace;
Our nearest view of Heaven is half-focussed in
her eyes ;
Her witching arms she fills
With dainty daffodils
That tumbled from her basket thro’ the turquoise-
burdened skies.
This morn, with crocus bell,
She rang old Winter’s knell;
It tinkled ’mid my dreaming like a peal o’ joy
afar;
And in Enchantment’s boat,
On sea o’ rose, afloat,
I found my lady jewelled with her
whitest star.
List! evory fibre reels ;
They’re here, those flashing wheels ;
Each spoke ablaze with emerald, thro’Joy’s r< d
gate they hum ;
O heart o’ mine, bend low,
And greet your mistress, so ;
No need to seek a prouder star ... my lady Spring
has come !

M. LEFRAND.
Are They?
I have an income, safe and sound,
A house, a yard or two of ground ;
Am healthy, temperate (fairly so),
Feel never sick or clammy ;
I should be happy here below.
No doubt I am. But am I ?
I’ve pals of various sorts, who treat
Me decently whene’er we meet:
There’s Jones, with whom I often quaff
The gin-and-soda fizzy ;
He has a frank and merry laugh—
Seems white, acts white. But is he?
There is a girl I mean to wed
Not very many weeks ahead :
She vows that when I am oppressed
With goblin, spook, or banshee,
She’ll take my head upon her breast,
And drive them off. But can she?
At intervals to church I walk,
To hear the hopeful parson talk :
He says, to gild the colors dun
Which cloud our earthly billet,
That Fate will furnish better fun
In Kingdom Come. But will it ?

The Sapling Grove.
In the sapling grove we wandered when our
hearts and hopes were young,
When my words were all unheeded, and my loves
were all unsung.
Then we listened to the music that was gathered
from afar
In the mazes of the mountains where the giant
tempests are.
Then I told you, little girlie, of my burning
heart’s desire,
And I said that frozen ages hence could never
quench its fire !
And I promised—aye, I promised . . . and you
kissed me in return
(O, the tiny stars were jewels and the planets
seemed to burn !).
And you said that I would vanquish any fates
that might assail,
That I’d profit by the lessons of the puny men
who fail.
And you said that I would conquer (O your
whispers low and sweet !),
That the joys of fame and fortune would be scat-
tered at my feet.
There the sheeny, silver sunlight through the
frondage used to shine,
And the purple-blossomed ivy with the grasses
was a-twine.
There the shadows used to linger when the
jewelled stars on high,
Like a host of lover-legions, went for ever swinging
by.
I have trodden many love-ways in a hundred
towns since then,
Stormed many a girlish fortress with my practised
tongue and pen ;
But when worldly worries weary, and my heart is
rent in twain,
Oh ! I'm yearning for you, dearie, and the
sapling grove again.
N.S.W.
GILROONEY.
The Maoriland scow, of which there are
some 600 plying their trade round the coast of
Ward’s State, is about to become a law-abiding
citizen. Hitherto the Marine Department has
shown a fine contempt for the flat-bottomed craft,
and it has been an Ishmael of the sea, but a
series of mishaps and wrecks has drawn public
attention towards these vessels, and Andrew
Miller, Minister of Marine, is busy hammering
together a Bill which will legitimise the scow.
The advantages of the scow over the schooner are
that it is cheaper to build, cheaper to run, and
will go through weather that would make a
schooner skipper sick to look at. Its disadvan-
tages are a troublesome habit of turning turtle
when badly loaded and a propensity for getting
wrecked. The scow is chiefly used as a timber-
carrier between Kaipara and Wellington, and in
the Hauraki Gulf, but it may be met with any-
where up the East Coast of the North Island, and
is also used in the Lyttelton-Wellington trade.
As the scow is locally made, locally owned, and
almost always manned by a local crew, it is wor-
thy of encouragement, if only as a training-ship
for the seamen of the future Maoriland navy.
The recent hot spell in England—it
reached 90° in the shade, or thereabouts —revealed
the fact that the despised Britisher has far more
sense in attiring himself according to the climate
he encounters than the Australian who copies his
faults. Waistcoats —sometimes even coats—were
cast off early in the summer, and Piccadilly looked
likea new rush, with thefioodof pink and blueshirts.
Many of both sexes abandoned undergarments
and wore sandals only on their bare feet. Hats
were seldom seen on either men or women after
sundown, and a blouse, a skirt, a parasol, and a
pair of sandals often comprised the whole costume
of the British girl. In fact, even the blouse and the
skirt became so diaphanous that the Vicar of
Windsor was impelled to institute a crusade, not
against the prevailing fashion, he explained, but
against any extension of it. Had the tempera-
ture gone up to the average of an Australian
summer, Britons would have probably reverted
to the costume of their ancestors, and Epsom
lawn would have been gladdened by countesses
attired mostly in green, fresh leaves. Perhaps
the most idiotic costume in the world is that of
the American bathing woman. An immense
sensation was caused at Atlantic City last month,
when the first bare-legged bather ever seen in the
United States went into the sea. She was inter-
viewed largely. Her photos were reproduced
everywhere, and sermons were preached de-
nouncing her legs. While mixed bathing has been
practised in America for years, the bathers have
worn costumes that were more fitted for the
Arctic regions, including stockings and boots.
The marvel is, if the women were too modest to
wear a dress suitable for the sea, that they didn’t
abolish mixed bathing and swim in comfort.
Australia is foolish about its street clothes in hot
weather, but there are no complaints to be made
about its seaside girl in the matter of over-
clothing.
Maoriland goes another step in State
Socialism by extending the provisions of the
Advances to Settler’s Act to city workers. The
scheme is to advance sums, up to £350, to workers
desiring to build homes ; capital and interest (5
per cent.) to be refunded in half-yearly instal-
ments extending over 36 years. It’s about time
the Sooialistically-enthusiastic city worker got
some of the profits of his beliefs. So far, the
profits have been mostly scoffed by the violently-
anti-Sosh farmer.

Model 1905 Self-Loading Rifle
This rifle is a six shot, hammerless take-down, made in .32 and .35 calibers,
the cartridges being of the modern smokeless powder type. The recoil of
the exploded cartridge ejects the empty shell, cocks the hammer and feeds
a fresh cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, leaving the rifle ready
to shoot upon the operator’s pulling the trigger. The self-loading system
adds much to the pleasure of rifle shooting, either at target or game. The
list price of this model is $28.00.

CET THIS BOOK!-
It is worth its weight in gold to WEAK
MEN and Sufferers from Debility.
It is the weak man’s guide and friend, and if you suffer and have not read it, you have missed
the best of all opportunities to inform yourself on your condition. ... It describes
the ailments that do the most to make a man miserable— those ailments that UNMAN
him and make him unfit for the every-day battles of life. It is profusely illustrated, showing how
we apply Electricity to cure this complaint.
You will notice on the left of this paragraph a COUPON; write in your name and address,
tear the Coimon and Book out of this advertisement and post it to us to-day. We will send the Book
by return post—closely sealed and postage paid. ... It describes in careful detail
DR. McLAUGHUN’S Electric Belt
the most famous of all patented remedies. Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt is guaranteed in
every case undertaken. It never fails to cure when recommended. ... To the men who have defied
the revenging power of Nature and overstepped the bounds of prudence; men who, from the result
of wear and tear upon the machinery that creates the Vital Force of the body, have become weak,
puny, nervous, and dyspeptic; men who are lacking in confidence and ambition, and those who are
suffering from Pains in the Back, Shoulders, or Chest, Weak Kidneys, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Lum-
bago, Varicocele, Rupture, and the many other evidences of decay of the vital force, WE OFFER
AID. We can cure you with Nature’s great power—ELECTRICITY, and make you feel well and
strong again. A means of restoring youthful vigor is priceless. Nothing in this world is worth
more to a man who lacks this element, and here is THE remedy within the reach of all sufferers.

. Nir. G. HALBEISCH, of G AN M AIN, N.S.W., writes : “ Dear Sirs, —When I first got your Belt I became dissatisfied
alter using it a few times. Probably I expected too much in too short a time, so I obtained some medicine and left the Belt off. The
medicine, however, did me no good, so I determined to again adopt the Belt, and I have always been glad since. This was two years
ago, and lam still well and .strong, having been completely cured. I hope other sufferers will be as successful.”

THE " BRUNSWICK» |GE MACHINE
i v
may be classed as a small HOUSEHOLD REFRICERATOR.
It’s capacity varies from 10 tons of ice to lOlbs., and it
is in its smallest size that its remarkable convenience
for small households is apparent.
Hotels, boarding houses, butchers, and restaurants
have hitherto had to be contented with an Ice Box and a
few blocks of ice—a wasteful and expensive proceeding.
With the BRUNSWICK ICE MACHINE you have a port-
able cold storage sufficient to keep sweet and sound all
your perishable stock, and, in the smallest size, give you
101 b. of ice per day for actual use as ice as well as
refrigeration—equal to 2001hs. of ice. The whole thing
is run by a little J-horse power motor, and the cost is
very moderate.
THE BRUNSWICK HOUSEHOLD ICE MACHINE
solves for ever the question of cold storage
on a small private scale. Send for Circular

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tim Bullktin would oblige the paper
(and, to an. extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good, thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bullktin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
oflictals. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

GEORGE REID, AND HIS YES-NO, AND
HIS PERMANENT YET FLEXIBLE
BLOT.
In Sydney last week George Reid, the leader of
Australian Toryism, the great Yes-No person, the
momentary clown of Australian politics, poured
forth the confused torrent of his programme. He
was helped in doing so by Joseph Cook, Motor-
Car Kelly, Pumpkin Smith, and Holy Hindle,
a back-number of the bagman persuasion, who
put in a brief spell in N.S.W. politics in the dim
long ago; and in the multitude of councillors there
was obscurity. On this occasion, Reid made a
mistake which was hardly to be expected of a
warrior whose goggle has shone so long at the
sides and tail-end of the battle. After much ver-
biage about the past, he proceeded to set forth his
policy for the future in a series of concise
paragraphs, and it was just because they
were concise that their baldness was so glar-
ingly apparent. A policy like Reid’s shouldn’t
be divided up into numbered paragraphs. It
should float around promiscuously amid the
backwash of the speaker’s eloquence ; it should
bob up and then bob down again; it should be
partly here and partly there, and it should
scatter all over the premises, and drift this way
and that on the face of the deep. Also it should
go to and fro like the devil in Job. Then it is
only a vague memory and a dancing shadow, and
no man can really get his hands on it to hold it up
to scorn. Reid’s unfortunate desire to put into a
clear light a thing which couldn’t stand inspection
led to the lamentable results set forth hereunder.
* » •» »
Clauses I. and 11. of the programme may be
passed over. Clause I. is an impassioned appeal
to the electors to “destroy the secret caucus” —
not the Foreign-trade caucus which elected Reid
to command the importing party, but the Labor
caucus. Clause 11. is another anguished appeal
to the same people to destroy the same thing.
Then comes Clause 111., which reads as follows:
I ask you to let the present Protective tariff rest, ad-
justing anomalies and hardships which the reports of the
Tariff Commission may bring to light. Personally I
favor the suggestion for a referendum to the whole
people, in order that the lamentable differences which
divide Liberals without dividing Socialists may be
settled.
This represents Gkeid, the Freetrader, offering
to sell his immortal principles for the sake of
office. He is an alleged Freetrader, who actually
urges people to lot the Protectionist tariff, such
as it is, remain. But the present tariff isn’t
effective Protection any more than it isFreetrade.
Reid wants to keep it in its half-and-half con-
dition, and the people are tired of half-and-half.
At the same time he proposes a fiscal referendum
—an idea which he has borrowod from the Labor
party—to decide about going the whole hog one
way or another, and upsetting the tariff which he
wants to keep exactly as it is, only with altera-
tions. This is the sort of thing for which he has
always denounced Die, vein —a shirking of Minis-
terial responsibility and a consequent falling
away from the true principles of constitutional
government. But at the same time he doesn’t
promise that if the referendum pans out
in favor of Freetrado he will, if he is Pre-
mier, introduce a real Freetrade policy.
Under such a policy, wherever it is neces-
sary, for the sake of revenue, to levy Cus-
toms duties on articles that can be locally made,
an equivalent excise duty is levied on the local pro-
duct. Thus the policy yields revenue, supplies
all the blessings of Free Competition, and admits
of none of the surreptitious Customs Protection
to wine, beer, sugar, tobacco, cigars, biscuits,
confectionery, <fce., nor the surreptitious Pro-
tection by differential postal rates to local
Freetrade newspapers, nor the surreptitious Pro-
tection by differential railway rates to the local
agriculturist; that Reid used to practise when he
was the importers’ Premier in N.S.W. And
Reid doesn’t promise, either, that, if the referen-
dum gives a majority for Protection, he and
Cook and Lonsdale will get to work honestly to
build a real Protectionist tariff that will be a per-
manent success—not set out to make a garish
anomaly that will bring Protection into discredit.
Nor does he guarantee that Kelly will cease
sniggering and lend his cordial aid. Reid, in
short, is a Freetrader who supports the present
Protectionist tariff, but wants it altered by a
referendum, yet doesn’t promise to take any
notice of the verdict of the referendum. He
doesn’t even promise that, if he becomes Premier,
he will hold any referendum at all; he simply
“favors the suggestion.”
* * « *
Clauses IV. and V. are financial, and naturally
go together :
The bookkeeping clauses should be ended. The case of
Westralia can be equitably provided for.
The protection afforded by the Braddon clause to the
finances of the State should be perpetually extended, but
in a more flexible form.
There is something beautifully airy, off-hand, and
non-committal about No. IV. In the division of
the Federal surplus “the case of Westralia
can be equitably provided for.” Possibly it
can, but how should it be provided for. and
what is Reid’s idea of an equitable provision '!
Three conferences of State Premiers have
considered the matter, and got no “forrarder,”
and have dispersed in disgust. If Reid will tell
exactly how he proposes to equitably fix things
up, and his scheme is accepted as equitable all
round, or even half-way round, then there will be
something gained, but he offers no scheme, equit-
able or otherwise. As for his demand for the
perpetuation of the Braddon clause, the coarse,
crude impudence of such a suggestion, coming
from Georoe Reid, is beyond words. The
Braddon clause stood as a perpetual proviso
(unless shifted by an alteration of the Constitu-
tion) in the Bill originally drafted by the Federal
Convention. It was on this clause that Reid
stumped N.S.W. like a shrieking fiend. The
“ Blot,” as he then called it, was ruinous, criminal,
idiotic, and a robbery of N.S.W. ; it almost
amounted to bigamy and was close upon arson.
It was through Reid’s campaign against the
Blot, combined with the infamous breach of
faith which the N.S.W. Parliament perpetrated
under Reid’s guidance when it raised the
minimum affirmative vote required to carry the
Constitution Bill from 50,000 to 80,000, that the
first Bill fell through ; it received a major-
ity of votes, but not a sufficiently large
majority. Then Reid went proudly to the Pre-
miers’ Conference in Melbourne to Fix Things
Up, and found that he was as mentally blank in
his financial details then as he is to-day. So he
got the Blot made a part of the Constitution for
10 years as a compromise, and came back a proud
man, saying that the country was saved. Now
he advances, as a reason why he should once more
get office, the fact that he is in favor of a per-
manent Blot. It is only a handful of years since
he was almost tearing up Australia by the roots
in his demands for no Blot at all. It is a smaller
handful of years since he posed as a great states-
man because of his temporary Blot. Now he
poses as a very great statesman because he is a per-
manent Blotter. True, he says that he wants
it made a “more flexible” Blot than it
is now, but as he gives no particulars as
to how the flexibility of the Blot is to be
brought about, that counts for little. Either
Reid, the Anti-Blotter, was a great fool in ’9B, or
Reid, the Pro-Blotter, is a very cheeky political
adventurer in ’O6. It is hard to say which. Any-
how, Reid has been a No-Blotter, and a Tem-
porary Blotter, and a Permanent Flexible Blotter,
and these things constitute a good deal of variety.'
•* + *■*
Clause VI. of Reid is beautifully vague:—
The question of old age pensions could be settled at once,
as it ought to be, if Queensland, South Australia and Tas-
mania, as I have pressed them to do, would fall into line
with the other three States which responded to my
appeal. In South Australia and Queensland there are
Labor Premiers. I regard a national system of old age
pensions as one of the essential features of Federal policy.
Reid’s theory that there ought to be Federal old
age pensions is borrowed from Watson and
Deakin. They both say that, and but for the
opposition of 'Reid’s party they would have
carried a Bill providing for payment of the pen-
sions. Reid’s statement that the question ought
to be settled at once is just what Watson and
Deakin say. The news that he doesn’t see his
way to deal with the matter without the con-
currence of Queensland, South Australia and
Tasmania marks him as a very inefficient old
person who can’t be trusted with any serious job,
for there is no more need to wait for the consent
of the State Legislatures before the Australian
Government does its square, honest duty to
its own Australian subjects than there is to
wait for the cordial support of Timbuctoo or the
approval of Hudson’s Bay. In this respect
Reid is inferior to Deakin and Watson, who
both see their way to provide Federal old age
pensions without waiting for the consent of any
lingering State Governments. And the information
that Reid appealed to these States and produced
no results only suggests that it might be advisable
to hand over the management of affairs to someone
who is more successful in the appeal business.
Then clause VII. arises like a spectre in the
night:—
If the people of Great Britain change their minds, and
believe a preferential trade with Australia advisable, I
would meet their wishes by an equitable agreement.
Again that “equitable agreement” which is
never defined —-the mere, vague implication that
if George Reid gets into power he will fly round
generally, and fix up things generally, and do
something generally that will please everybody in
a large, general way.
•* * # *
There is something of a gap here in the pro-
gramme. Clause VII I. is only a general statement
that if Australia offers a preference to Britain it
should be a preference, and it shouldn’t be no
preference at all, which is equivalent to saying
that if a man is a man he should be a man, and
not a horse. Clause IX. is another general state-
ment to the effect that there ought at once to be
an Australian fleet, but that it is an affair of the
future; all the same, G. Reid thoroughly be-
lieves in Australians learning to defend them-
selves, and also he thinks the appointment of an
Australian to command the local forces, and thus
learn to defend himself, is “ ignoble.” And then,
after some more generalities, this gem obtrudes
itself with purest ray serene :
COMPULSORY ARBITRATION in Australia, so far,
has not worked well, for either employer or employed,
in many cases. Peace and harmony have certainly not
been established. ONE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT is
worth a thousand settlements bv force. I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE THE COMPULSORY PROCESS OE CONCILIA-
TION PUT MORE TO THE FRONT. A comparison be-
tween the constitution and working of the Wages Boards
of Victoria and the Arbitration Act of New South Wales
as a means of securing the great objects of such laws, (1)
conciliation, (2) fair wages, and (3) if necessarv, a COM-
PULSORY SETTLEMENT OF DIFFERENCES, seems
to me to be all in favor of the Victorian system. Although
I submitted to the general sense of the House in the
matter of preference to unionists, with the rider
attached, I am personally opposed most strongly to
any exercise of a power of preference for one worker
against another, by a judge presiding over a tribunal
of justice.
All which boils down to the fact that George
Reid regards compulsory arbitration as a failure.
He believes in the voluntary settlement of differ-
ences. He wants “to see the compulsory process
of conciliation put more to the front.” He
admires the Victorian system of a compulsory
settlement of differences, while believing the com-
pulsory policy hasn’t worked well. And after all
this compulsoriness, he wants to be strictly volun-
try. In fact, he would rather compel people to
be voluntary than not have them voluntary at all.
Also, he doesn’t believe in preference to unionists,
but he “submitted to the general sense of the
House ” —in other words, he went with the
majority and shouted with the largest crowd
rather than risk his job.
* * * *
The rest of Reid’s programme is built on much
the same lines, and the “Yes” and the “No”
are evenly balanced all through. He is against
breaking up the great land monopolies with a
graduated land-tax to find land for immigrants,
and he is against Protection to find factory em-
ployment for immigrants, but he thinks immigra-
tion should be encouraged. Already the private
monopolist has so much of the good land, and the
State so little, that for every decent farm that the
State has to offer, there are about 20 applicants,
but Reid says we should encourage an influx of
farmers. He also holds that “without sacrificing
the vital principle of racial integrity we should set
ourselves to develop the friendliest possible rela-
tions with all nations.” Thereby the fatted cir-
cumstance with the monocle comes up against
this position : (1) We can’t admit Chinese, Japan-
ese, and Hindus without sacrificing our status as a
white people : (2) the only reason why Chinese,
Japanese, and Hindus are hostile to us is that we
won’t admit them ; (3) in some airy, unspecified
way, by a general waving of hands and an affable
slapping of these races on the back, we should
make them friendly without removing the only
cause of their unfriendliness. In fact, we should
quarrel with them by keeping them out, and at
the same time be on the best of terms with them
by not letting them in. And as Reid holds that we
should keep them out for the sake of our racial inte-
grity, and maintain our Protectionist tariff against
them—he says he is in favor of the present Pro-
tectionist tariff against them, and yet says we
should be on the most friendly terms with them,
it is naturally “up to” Reid to explain how he
proposes to cultivate this glowing friendship. Of
course, he may send these foreign races a picture
post-card, and a packet of cigarettes, and a left-off
bell-topper, but that would hardly meet the case.
The absence of details here is something lament-
able.
* * * *
The other reasonably coherent items in the
programme of G. H. Reid are these two :
Subject to precautions against strike labor, and decep-
tive agreements, I am in favor of the repeal of ail the
provisions relating to white immigration.
The Northern Territory must be federalised, civilised,
and developed. That is one of the greatest and grandest
tasks of the Commonwealth. In that task beyond most
others, there is room for boundless enterprise, and only
by such means can Australia attain a defensive position.
At present the only legal enactments against the
influx of white labor are enactments against strike
labor, enactments against the introduction of
persons brought here under unfair agreements,
and enactments against the influx of criminals,
lepers, .and other badly-diseased or disreputable
persons. So unless Reid proposes to admit
criminals and diseased persons, including lepers,
he proposes, with much excitement and fury, to
leave things as they are. As for the Northern
Territory, he urges that the Commonwealth
should take it over, just as Deakin and
Watson and all the rest of the Reps,
do. The difficulty, however, is that Deakin
wants to take it over, and simply pay for
all existing public works, and agree to
finish the transcontinental railway, while the
South Australian Government won’t surrender it
unless the Commonwealth pays all the revenue
deficits of the last half-century, and agrees to
build the railway along a route laid down by the
S. A. Government. If Reid goes on the economical
principles of Deakin he won’t get the Territory,
and if he accedes to South Australia’s terms he
will be cursed in a thousand different directions
for weakness, subservience and extravagance. So
Reid carefully avoids saying what he will do. He
is simply of a large general opinion that the Ter-
ritory, which he didn’t attempt to take over when
he was in office, should be taken over. The
Bulletin, for its own part, believes that the
Territory should be taken on South Australia’s
terms, but that isn’t the question ; the present
matter is the uttgr impossibility of getting a very
fat and hazy man to go into details about anything.
• • • *
By way of postscript Reid says he is in favor of
a survey being made for the transcontinental
railway to Westralia—just as Deakin and
Watson are—but he doesn’t say anything re his
views about the railway itself. He may be for
it, or he may be against it. If he is against it,
there is nothing to be gained by being in favor of
the survey, and, if he is for it, it would be grati-
fying to know if he has any plans for overcoming
the obstruction of S. Australia, or, at least, any
better plans than Deakin has.
♦ * * *
The rest of the programme of G. H. Reid is
two columns of jeremiads and language akin to
that of Solomon Eagle, and the burden thereof
is a shadowy and indefinite something of his own
invention called “Sosh.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Jap on The Ramp.
California, TJ.S.A. —which is cursed by a huge
Jap coolie population—enacts that the brown
kiddies mustn’t mix in the State schools with
young white Americans. The decision is just and
sternly necessary. There is no reason why
American parents should let their children mix
morals and manners with Asiatics. But the
Japanese Government takes offence, and, according
to the Washington authorities, “a grave situation
has arisen,” which can mean nothing else
than that the Brown Man talks war. It is a posi-
tion full of uneasy threats to Australia. If the
Jap dignity is so touchy, and the Jap insolence so
great, as to wish to interfere with such a purely
domestic American matter as the conduct of the
Californian State schools, how heavy must be the
grudge which the Brown Man secretly nurses
against White Australia ! And if the Japanese
are prepared to menace a mighty Power such as
the American, what will stand in the way
of their attempting force against Aus-
tralia when the time is considered ripe
to demand unrestricted Japanese immigration to
the Commonwealth ? To Great Britain, too, the
position is full of disquieting possibilities. With
British help, which the Jap has the right to claim,
a Brown war against the United States would
cripple that Power for years, since on sea the
combination would be irresistible. Japan rules
the Pacific, and Britain the Atlantic. How does
Britain like the prospect of shelling New York in
the interests of Yokohama? Even without British
help the Japs, taking advantage of the fact that the
U.S. can’t concentrate its navy save by sending
its Atlantic squadron on the exceedingly long
voyage round Cape Horn, could do enormous
damage on the Pacific Coast of America, and
seize the American over-sea colonies, and might
reduce the States to the humiliation of
appealing to the South American republics for
naval help. Civilisation will, in the future, pay
many a pilgrimage of hatred to the tombs of those
traitors to the race who, by the Anglo-Japanese
alliance, sold the White Man’s hegemony for a
temporary political advantage.
♦
Whom to Vote For.
Organisation on the Progressive side in N.S.W.
and Victoria drifts into a muddle which promises
well for the Reidites. In Victoria nothing much
better was hoped for. The Labor electoral
leagues there gave good notice of their intention
to try and knife even those Protectionists who
loyally supported the Labor Government. But
in N.S.W. more sweet reasonableness was antici-
pated. and the anticipation would have been,
doubtless, realised if a little diplomacy in
negotiation had been shown. An excellent
start was made in a tacit sort of agreement that
sitting Laborites and Protectionists should meet
with no opposition except from Reidites. If
negotiations had been carried on further on those
lines, and a joint campaign arranged in some
electorates, a staggering blow might have been
delivered to Reidism. In five N.S. Wales con-
stituencies at least there was a reasonable chance
of defeating the sitting Anti-Sosh member.
Delightful prospects of that sort are fading away
rapidly in view of the cut-throat attitude which
the Protectionist and Labor organisations have
adopted towards one another. Each alleges that
the other wants the earth, which is possibly true.
The Labor organisation is certainly not too con-
ciliatory or moderate in its attitude. But that
doesn’t excuse the senseless idiocy of the Protec-
tionist organisation in deciding to run candidates
where, admittedly, they have not the ghost of a
chance, simply to spoil the campaign of Labor
Protectionists, such as Foster in New Eng-
land. If the attitude of the Protectionist
organisation is that it prefers a Reidite
to a Labor Protectionist, it had better
say so definitely, and the situation will be
somewhat simplified—to its cost. If the present
confusion continues the task of the elector will not
be an easy one. But The Bulletin gives these
guides:
1. Don’t vote for a Freetrader at any price, unless in
the event of a Labor Freetrader having only an Anti-Sosh
opponent. In that case vote Labor—with regrets.
2. If there is a choice between two Protectionists, vote
for the one who supports a Federal land-tax, unless he is
obviously 1 “ vote splitter,” whose chances are hopeless—
a candidate run in, on forlorn-hope lines, as a Lab< r
response to the Protectionist insanity of running such
men as Vincent (New England).
The chief issue is the tariff one, for the tariff
must be settled by next Parliament; and there is
a second way of getting adequate land taxation-
through the State Legislatures. It is a poor
chance, but still a chance, whilst adequate Pro-
tection can only come from the Australian
Parliament.
Bruce Smith, Anarchist.
The above description is not printed on the card
of the self-satisfied Tory gentleman who delivers
addresses at afternoon tea to ladies of both sexes,
but it ought to be. Bruce Smith certainly isn’t
a complete Anarchist, but then very few people
are complete ; certainly he is more an Anarchist
than Reid ever was a Freetrader, and probably
he is more an Anarchist than Watson is a


Socialist. The wealthy and supercilious class
which mostly consists of Society and bagmen—
has such a vast and abounding ignorance of all
things political that it will probably be astonished
to learn that its pet Smith is an Anarchist. That
class vaguely lumps together Anarchists, Socialists
and Communists as wild-haired men who
throw bombs and don’t wash. Also, it
reckons that the Communards who fought
behind the barricades of Paris in ’7l and the
Communists are one and the same thing, because
both words begin with “Comm.” Therefore,
it is well to explain that a Socialist and an
Anarchist represent the opposite poles of political
theory, and a Communist is neither of them, and
a Communard is not related to any one of
them except by that resemblance of sound
which connects pigs with pigments and
eggs with egotism. The Socialist stands
for law and order par excellence; he believes
in discipline and organisation to save the in-
credible waste that arises from useless competi-
tion. The Anarchist believes in absolute non-
interference by the State. He represents Private
Enterprise in its complete form. He is the top-
note of Free Competition. And there is no class
which hollers more loudly for Private Enterprise
and Free Competition and non-interference by
the State than that to which Bruce Smith
lielongs. while Bruce Smith himself, judged
by his language, represents the last and
finest development of his species. The complete
Anarchist, believing that the State shouldn’t in-
terfere, and that there should be absolute Private
Enterprise and Free Competition, doesn’t see
that it is any use having a State, but there Bruce
Smith only differs from his fellow-Anarchists
in an infinitesimal detail —the shadow of the
shade of a detail. Smith wants to preserve the
form of government, but professes to believe that
it shouldn’t interfere ; his political brother, who
threw the bomb at theKingof Spain, reckons that if
the State doesn’t interfere it might as well not be
preserved. They both agree that the thing should
be dead ; the difference is merely a question of
burial or non-burial. It may be explained here
that an Anarchist doesn’t necessarily throw bombs,
and that The Bulletin doesn’t for a moment sus-
pect Anarchist Smith of intending to throw any-
thing except a chest and a pompous attitude.
There have been Roman Catholics who burned
Protestants and Jews, Anglicans who hanged,
branded, thumb-screwed and whipped Presby-
terians and Puritans, and Puritans who publicly
flogged Baptists and Quakers, but it doesn’t follow
that more than an obscure percentage of Roman
Catholics, Anglicans and Puritans are built that
way. Similarly, there are a few Anarchists who
throw bombs, and a lot who don’t. The Anarchist
believes in absolute non-interference and com-
plete Private Enterprise; therefore he doesn’t
see the use of preserving people and institutions
that interfere, and Governments that get in the
way of Private Enterprise, and some excessive
persons try to remove the root of the interference
bv blowing it up, just as some excessive re-
ligionists have tried to convert the world by
butchering people who refused to be converted.
But the great bulk of mankind are just philo-
sophical religionists like the Archbishop of
Sydney, or philosophical Socialists like J. C.
Watson, or philosophical Anarchists like Bruce
Smith. The Bulletin takes the trouble to write
this merely to define Smith. It has always had
an opinion that Smith ought to be defined—
Anarchist Smith.
Making Money out of Politics.
Joseph Cook, the renegade coal-trucker of Lith-
gow, stated last week, at Pymble (N.S.W.), that
“the only men who were making money out of
politics were Labor members.” This coarse but
interesting remark is calculated to make people
ask questions. All the money Joseph has is
understood to be either money that he made out
of politics, or interest on savings effected out of
the money he made out of politics. The first
money he made out of politics he made by being
a Labor member. Even in those days he
was reputed to be a desperately saving man
—a famine-stricken local preacher with the
glare of economy in his eye. He was never
accused, as far as The Bulletin is aware,
of the careless liberality of such a man as
Dacey, or the slow, serious, Scotch-looking
generosity of such as M‘Go WEN. He quitted
the Labor party when he saw Salary beckoning
in the distance, and became a desperately-saving
Postmaster-General. Report says that he slept-
at the office to save money—but that may be only
report. Regarded as a man who accumulated his
own fortune (said to be reasonably large) out of
politics, Cook’s jeer at the party which he quitted
when he saw Salary beckoning in the distance
calls for explanation. He asserts now that the
Labor members are the only ones who are making
money out of their Parliamentary billets. Yet he
(Cook) gets the same pay as Watson, Hughes,
Maloney and Co., and outwardly he is more
economical than any of them. (To mention
economy in the same breath with the name of Dr.
Maloney, whose life mostly consists of attending
the poor gratis and lending money to his own
patients, sounds like a joke.) Therefore, the in-
ference is that Cook means that the Labor mem-
bers have unseen political sources of revenue that
he hasn’t, or else that he has unseen expenses that
they haven’t. Unseen political sources of revenue
generally mean corruption. Unseen expenses
generally mean fast women and slow horses, and
midnight revelry done with a corkscrew. It is up
to Joseph Cook to be more explicit. Does he
want to charge the Labor members with corrup-
tion, or does he want to be suspected of being a
disgrace to the black-tailed coat that he preaches
in on Sunday ? In what way is a Labor member
or a Protectionist, with £4OO a year and a free
railway pass, making more money out of politics
than Joe Cook, with £4OO a year and a free rail-
way pass?
.
“ Where the White Can’t Work.”
White Australia is far greater than the sugar in-
dustry, and is not, therefore, to be sacrificed to
preserve it. But it may be admitted at once that
if white labor can make a success of the business,
it will not only be much easier to accomplish a
White Australia, but also to make it secure wffien
it has been accomplished. It is from that point
of view that the report furnished every year by
Dr. Maxwell, the controller of the Queensland
Central Sugar Mills, is of national importance.
To an enormous extent White Australia is in the
general view reduced to a mere matter of finance.
The anti-whites say that “whites can’t work in
the North ; ” they really mean that whites can’t
be offered enough pay to induce them to work in
the North. And these reports of Dr. Maxwell
suggest some of the reasons why that pay
can’t be offered, or, at least, isn’t offered.
The position of these central mills is now
pretty well-known. The State advanced the
money to build them, taking a mortgage over the
cane-lands of the so-called “shareholders” as
collateral security. In a few cases the mills were
well-managed, and paid interest and redemption ;
in others, they simply fell headlong into default,
and finally had to be taken over by the State.
Yet, under a proper system of State administra-
tion, there was last year only one mill which did
not show a handsome profit after paying interest
and other liberal standing charges. Moreover,
none but white labor was employed at the mills.
That suggests one reason for the failures upon
which the “white men can’t work in the North ”
cry has been built—the want of business methods
on the part of Private Enterprise. It is very easy
to let things slide in the North ; and, 99 times out
of a hundred, when things slide they land in a
bog. Out of this bog comes the cry “We must
have the cheap Kanaka,” or the Hindu—or, most
hopeless of all, B. Smith’s friend, the Jap. But
that isn’t the only reason for the northern failures.
The landlord, exacting his pound of unearned
flesh, is another. There are 12 central mills alto-
gether, built on the security of mortgages. At
Nerang the State got Bs. lid. per acre for this
land ; it was valued for the purposes of these
mortgages at £lO 10s. 6d. per acre ! And, though
that is an increase of 2300 per cent., this capital
value does not represent anything like the full
basis upon which rental values are fixed. An
annual rent of £5 per acre is demanded for land
which the State sold straight out for under 15s.
per acre. Practically all the available land-
owners were the original “shareholders” in the
mills; yet last season, at Moreton, there were 191
non-shareholding suppliers of cane, as against 32
“shareholders,” and a great many of these
“ shareholders ” do not themselves now supply a
ton of cane. They are landlords, pure and simple,
squeezing out enormous rents—in many cases,
more than 500 per cent, per annum of the price
paid for the freehold. It is perfectly true that
the sugar business can’t maintain both the greedy
landlord, wanting his annual 500 per cent, per
annum for doing nothing, and white Australia,
unless Australia continues the present excise duty
on “colored ” sugar. But if that duty were made
so high as to squeeze out the Chinese, Kanaka,
and other discolored tenants, it would not neces-
sarily squeeze out the blood-sucking landlord.
He would still levy toll on the white tenant.
Altogether, he is a hard proposition. The pro-
gressive land-tax doesn’t promise to squeeze him
out. Generally speaking, he isn’t a big landlord :
the capital value of farms out of which he squeezes
£IOOO a year is usually under £SOOO, on account of
the uncertainty of the industry. Nevertheless, a
method will have to be devised to get rid of him,
because he is a very formidable enemy of White
Australia.

Charity.
It was lately announced by cable that the death
of the widow of the great London money-lender,
Sam Lewis, would set at liberty £1,000,000 to be
devoted to purposes of charity. The episode is
one more instance of the horrors of philanthropy,
and it Serves to point a moral and adorn a tale.
There are two ways in which a country can be
run with at least some semblance of Christian
sentiment, though in one way it is a very faint
semblance indeed. One idea—the only one
really worth considering—consists in, as far as
possible, doing away with the need for charity.
A country run on that basis would remorselessly
break up all great estates to begin with. It
would pass stringent laws to prevent the accumu-
lation of any new estates. It would give every
agricultural tenant the right to compulsorily pur-
chase from his landlord the area that he farmed,
and seek to make every occupier his own landlord.
It would aim at a system of small farms. It would
graduate the income-tax so as to levy heavily on
large cash fortunes, and when the owner of a large
fortunedied it would cause a compulsory division of
the pile among his children (after making provision
for his widow), so as to promote a general diffusion
of wealth, recognising that the worst thing that
can be done with a large fortune is to keep it
together. It would lay special and ruinous imposts
on the owner of fertile land that was kept out of
use for mere purposes of sport. It would provide
abundance of work for the people by a sound
Protectionist tariff ; and by means of laws regu-
lating wages, hours, sanitation, &c., it would see
that the workers got a good share of the benefits of
industry. The State would own all railways and
tramways, and provide cheap transportation so
that the workers could live a little way out of
town instead of being huddled close together in
slum tenements; and then it would wade in to
abolish slums, not by buying them up at ruinous
prices, and thus lavishly rewarding landlords for
being brutal, dirty and insanitary, but by declar-
ing the slum landlord a public enemy, and treat-
ing him as such. It would establish old age
pensions, not as charity but as a right of citizen-
ship. It would severely restrict the influx of
cheap aliens. And having done these things,
all it would require in the way of charity
would be a few—only a few—hospitals, orphan-
ages and lunatic asylums. In a community
run on such principles, charity would be almost
unknown, and the buzzing, advertising, patronis-
ing philanthropist would be a dead and gone
curse. The other method, the one favored in
England, lays no restrictions on land-grabbing,
the heaping up of huge fortunes, rack-renting,
slum dwellings, the payment of wages so low that
they make existence almost impossible, cheap im-
ports, and the swamping of the labor market by
pauper immigration; but as England has some kind
of a conscience, this vast mass of sin, misery, and
wretchedness is alleviated to a small, poor extent
by a huge system of alms. Thus there have grown
upthreeneedlessly unproductive classes, all utterly
obnoxious —theloafingrich, theloafingpaupers, and
a horde of buzzing, benevolent busybodies or
amateur and professional philanthropists, many of
whom live on the game, and earn salaries by
collecting money from the rich and dispensing
part of it with much pomp to the poor. And in
addition to the loafing or complete paupers
there are millions and millions of hard-
working semi-paupers. A large proportion of
the British people live in the constant state
of hat-touching and bob-curtsey that is the sign and
symbol of partial or complete pauperism or
inherited pauper instincts. They are humble
and grovelling; they are respectful when ad-
monished by the rector, the curate, and the lord
of the manor ; they are thankful for soup, coals,
blankets, and other charities; they receive the
broken bread that is leftover from the communion
service at the little dissenting Bethel; they haunt
the city charities (with much hat-touching and
bob-curtsey) in hard winters when work is scarce;
and through receiving as alms a fraction of what
they should receive as a matter of justice, most of
the manliness and much of the womanliness has
been knocked out of them. This writer has
known, in a petty English agricultural village, a
large, gross woman with a reputation for benevo-
lence—the wife of the rector, who combined
rectingwith being a considerable landowner—who
habitually inspected the laborers’ cottages to see
if they were clean. She would deposit her large
presence on a chair while holding these inquisi-
tions, and the laborer’s wife and family stood
respectfully at attention. She ordered bedding to
be brought into her presence to see if it
were clean. She would personally paw and in-
spect girls of 14 or 15, so that she might see that
their personal cleanliness was up to sample—it
must be set down to her credit that, in a
dirty community she was a whale for a cer-
tain amount of cleanliness, and was impera-
tive about a weekly bath. She gave orders to
the mothers for the chastisement of boys and girls
whose conduct she considered left something to be
desired. She gave solemn and ominous warnings
to those who were irregular in attendance at
church. She investigated their household balance-
sheets. She dispensed charity liberally, and was a
walking Inquisition. That was in the late sixties;
her species may have been modified since then,
but it certainly isn’t extinct. And every time this
writer hears of some huge gift to British charity
he thinks of large women like that whom he used
to know; of large, patronising, overbearing squires
whom he used to know ; of the professional phi-
lanthropists whose orations he used to hear occa-
sionally at meetings—perspiring men, servile to
the rich, patronising to the poor, who called for
cheers for “our noble benefactor,” and drew
salaries as secretaries of charities, or did the work
for mere pomp and advertisement. And a class
below them were the paid overseers of homes of one
kind and another, where the diet was plain and the
discipline rigorous, and the boys wore smock-
frocks, and the education consisted largely of
learning to be respectful to the great local digni-
tary, and his family, and his satellites, and his
carriage, and his Jeames, and his dog, and all that
was his’n.
Carruthers’ Financial Reform.
When Premier Carruthers, of N.S.W., inserted
a proviso in the North Coast Railway Bill that
half the cost of the railway was to be paid out of
revenue, some people made the grievous mistake
of thinking that there might possibly be, some-
where, a streak of political honesty in Joseph.
His half-promise, made at the election which sent
him into office, that he would cease borrowing,
proved a fraud ; he is borrowing just as gaily as
his predecessor did. His promise that he would
borrow only for reproductive works proved a
fraud ; the public works that are now charged to
loans are just about as shady a lot. as in RKin’s
time. His Sinking Fund is a fraud ; with much
flourish of trumpets he established a Sinking Fund
which is really a smaller affair than the one which
Waddell ran without any flourish of trumpets,
and, moreover, as it doesn’t accumulate at com-
pound interest, it is really no Sinking Fund at all.
His Public Works Fund is a ghastly fraud; the
same old works are charged to the same old loans,
but instead of the loan money going straight to
the works expenditure it first goes into the Public
Works Fund, and then it comes out of the Fund.
But the proposal that half the expense of the
North Coast railway should be paid out of revenue
almost looked like an attempt at partial honesty.
Events have proved it the worst fraud of the lot.
When the Bill had passed its second reading,
Reynoldson, a Government supporter, moved
that this little scrap of decency should be thrown
out, and that the whole cost of the line should be
charged to loans. The proposal was carried by
38 to 20. Among those who voted for striking
out the Government’s much-advertised scrap of
honesty were all the members of the Govern-
ment then present—Lands Minister Ashton,
Cheap Honorary Minister Dick, Chief Secre-
tary Hogue, Public Works Minister Lee,
Mooee of the Mines and Agriculture Depart-
ment, Barnabas O’Conor (Minister for Public
Instruction), and Attorney - General Wade.
Every one of them declared by his vote that the
pretence of paying for part of even one public
work out of anything but loans was mere sham
and hypocrisy. The proposal to thus mutilate the
Government’s own Bill was carried solely by the
votes of the Government and its supporters ; the
Labor party was solid for honesty, or at least
partial honesty. And next day Premier Car-
RUTHERS, who had kept away from the division,
cordially approved of the action of the House and
of his colleagues in destroying a feature of his
Bill, about which he had bragged as if honesty
were a thing of his own invention. Presumably,
therefore, the Government, after wearing a
specially big halo over the alleged fact that it was
going to be half-respectable for once, put up
Reynoldson to propose his amendment; it
couldn’t have supported the amendment more
enthusiastically if it had proposed the thing
itself. After this, no one is likely to believe in
any promise of financial reform that JOSEPII may
make until it sees the money down, and even then
it will wonder where the money was secretly bor-
rowed from, Joseph’s inability to go straight
amounts to a disease—or a corkscrew ; and his
political track is that of a drunken man shambling
down a rainbow.
The Judkins Jahad.
Judkins introduced himself to the Sydney public
last week. He is a small, rat-featured gentleman
with a gimlet eye and a look of bristling curiosity
about his chin, which may be the fault of the
brand of razor he uses. Judkins came to Sydney
to tell how good he was, and how he intended
to fight the monster, Sin, at all hazards to
Judkins. (If Sin had any sense it wouldn’t
expose Judkins to any hazards. As a work-
ing model of Virtue, he should drive many
away from it to Sin.) There is no doubt
that the visit of Judkins would have been of
much benefit to Sydney if he had been allowed to
deliver his message. For Judkins’ talk doesn’t
help Judkins any. But the folly of fools stood in
the way. Judkins was howled down, as Reid —
the political Judkins who is always judding
about Socialism —was howled down at Redfern.
Therefore both individuals got kinder treatment
than they deserved. In the first place, to howl
down a speaker at a public meeting is an out-
rage against social order which must attract
sympathy to its victim. In the next place,
the more people of the Reid and Judkins
type talk, the more they expose themselves as
shallow and hysterical. When Judkins can’t be
heard, and can merely be seen opening and closing
his mouth, then the openings and shuttings of
Judkins may represent the wisdom of Solomon
for all the evidence there is to the contrary. It is
foolish of an audience to burst its collar giving
Jud the benefit of a doubt that he doesn’t
deserve, and to show itself at the same
time as a coarse, unmannerly, illogical, and
wholly disgraceful mob. If it were possible,
to get a good crowd to attend a Judkins
or Reid show, listen in stony silence, and
then pass a unanimous vote of condemnation,
the effect would be excellent. But the public
mind isn’t disciplined to that point of perfection
yet. The hostiles should, therefore, stay away,
and let the speaker face the reproach of empty
benches. Howl down J udkins and he begins to
talk of his Jahad. And, in sober truth, he is only a
Joke.

Playing the Fool with Defence.
Senator Playford, on behalf of the Deakin
Government, has announced a play-the-fool
Defence policy, which will do nothing to help that
Administration with patriotic electors. Play-
ford still holds to the opinion that nothing is
wanted more than has been done already.
He holds—Heaven only knows why—that the
largest force which could be landed in Australia
by an enemy would be 20,000 men, and says
that to meet that force Australia has an army of
25,000 men on a peace footing, which force could be
increased to 39,000 in case of war. There are, or
are going to be, 60,000 rifles in Australia, with 500
rounds of ammunition per man, and a factory is
to be established to make rifle barrels. Further,
Australia has “ the finest of field artillery, with 80
15-pounder and 18-potinder guns.” Much of this
is sheer ignorance—the ignorance of a potato
gardener grappling with a problem of which he
knows not the simplest factors. The rest of it
looks rather like deliberate misrepresentation,
unless it is also ignorance—the still denser ig-
norance of a potato gardener, who has gone off
his head, and thinks potatoes grow on apple -trees.
A few facts : Australia has nominally an army of
25,000 men. That force is raked up by counting
in all the Permanent, militia, and volunteer
regiments. The Permanent forces are thoroughly
efficient; since the era of the Commonwealth .they
have been to a great extent relieved of tbeiFsoeial
duties as officers’servants, garden pariy waiters
and so on ; now they form as good afo - ce as could
be found in the world. But they constitute only
a tiny fraction of the 25,000. The militia regi-
ments are also efficient. The volunteers range
from fair efficiency (such as that of the Scottish.
Rifles in N.S.W.) to comic incapacity, such as
that of the regiment of which Jawbone Neild
used to be colonel and Bill Wilks captain. It
would be absurd to class the majority of the
volunteers as efficient ; they’re certainly not
so as regards the capacity of the officers,
and by the capacity of the officers, an
army must be tested in actual warfare. If
Senator Playford knew anything of his
Asia Moves.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ The Sentinel of the Pacific.—Wanted : Compulsory
Military Training.”— Bulletin, 11/10/’Ofi.
Lo ! a bitter thing is coming from the North,
whence all things came.
Like a little cloud now looming, but ’tis nascent
smoke and flame—
Smoke and flame, and wrack and pillage, blood
and brimstone yet to be,
As awakened Asia’s millions move their masses on
the sea.
Here behold our lonely outpost, with the khakied
sentinel,
Whom we place as ward and bogey, and imagine
answers well ;
But the Angel of our Fortunes, if we have one,
well may weep,
For the sentry has no rifle, and has drunk himself
to sleep.
Can we blame him? Well, perhaps not; he is
doing as we do ;
And the soldier, like the schoolboy, from his
bosses takes his cue.
So, “Your open gate invites us,” the surveying
foeman mocks,
And Fools’ Paradise is guarded by an empty
sentry-box.
While we run about to races, and we chant, to
vibrant chords,
Our interminable cricket, and its “ashes” and
rewards,
Dust and ashes be our guerdon, if we cannot learn
to rise
Higher than the aimless pastime which is all we
seem to prize !
Oh, we feel securely standing, yet are nearing to
a fall !
But our happy, heedless hoodlums flout the
writing on the wall,
Though it flares for all to read it —“ Mene, mene,
tekel,” and
All the rest of its weird warning. Shall we never
understand ?
Never comprehend its meaning till a doomful day
shall dawn
When we face our Armageddon from an Asiatic
spawn,
And fanatic, swarming legions, of a swart, for-
bidding hue,
Grind to dust our pallid units, as they surely
hope to do ?
Hear Procrastination’s preachers! “There’s no
fear for us at all !
Neither sun nor cloud can harm us, and that
writing on the wall
Wasn’t written for our reading; ours is no Bel-
shazzar’s fate.
We are England’s favored children, and she
guards the Empire’s gate.”
Some of us are “ England’s children” ! Aye, but
England’s far away !
If she wished, she couldn’t help us on our wild,
alarum day.
Would she wish to ? I’ve a notion, and it’s
more than a surmise,
That she doesn’t see Australia quite through our
Australian eyes.
In her sympathy with “Color” she might scarce
be put about
When the heathen in his hunger, and his hun-
dreds, ate us out.
In the glamor of her fancy for her tinted, dear
allies,
She may view a dark eruption as a blessing in
disguise.
The sky is growing darker, ever darker, day by
day;
And the cloud gets bigger, blacker, while our
careless, pleasured way
Still is scrolled with mystic letters, which,
think, may represent
“Mene, tekel,” and “upharsin,” or their Jap
equivalent.

department he would represent the Australian
army at about 15,000 efficients, with no body of
trained officers in reserve allowing for quick expan-
sion in time of crisis. Men who are fair shots can
be made into infantry in a month. It usually
takes three years to train an officer into efficiency.
The Australian army is not as Minister Playford
represents, either as to the strength of its peace
standing or the possibility of expansion toa war foot-
ing. And if it were a fact that Australia had 25,000,
or even 39,000 soldiers, still that force would not
be sufficient to guard against a raiding force of
20,000 regulars. To have 25,000 or 39.000 soldiers
scattered all over this vast continent does not
mean that a force equal to 20,000, or even
1000, men could be mobilised at a day’s—
or even three months’—notice at the spot
—which would not be advertised before-
hand, and which might be Port Darwin
—the enemy chose to attack. A Defence
Minister should know this ; Playford seemingly
doesn’t. It is hard on some other points to
accept ignorance as his apology. The Defence
Minister says there are 80 15-pounder and 18-
pounder field artillery guns in Australia. As a
matter of truth, there are no 18-pounders—the
modern, efficient artillery gun—issued to the field
artillery. Some have arrived from England, are now
in store, and will have to be sent back to England
—in the absence of an Australian arms factory—
for alteration. There are not 20 15-pounder guns
in the Commonwealth. N.S. Wales, with four
batteries of field artillery, has only 15-pounder
guns enough for one battery. In case of war,
the bulk of the field artillery would have to use,
not the modern quick-firing 18-pounder (of which
Australia has none), not even the obsolete but
fairly good 15-pounder (of which Australia has
about a dozen), but old, muzzle-loading pieces of
the date of the Soudanese war. They might as
well fight with the wooden jingalls of the Chinese.
It is not necessary to follow Minister Playford
through all his statements to show that he knows
little, and cares less, for Australian defence. And
it is necessary to believe that the Ministry which
allows him to guide the Defence Department
cares as little and knows as little. Prime Minister
Deakin may profess sympathy with the National
Defence League, and its programme of effective
and economical military defence. Minister
Ewing may appear to follow his chief, and even
go further. His colleagues, Lynk, Chapman, and
Groom, may hold sensible views on the subject.
But they must all be content to be judged by
Playford ; and Playford’s policy is to play the
fool with defence.

Another scandalous charge of “girl outrage”
was summarily dismissed by a jury at Melbourne
Criminal Court last week. The damsel (17 years
old) stated that one youth “ accomplished her
ruin,” whilst another youth, who had taken
her for a walk, abetted his friend’s wicked-
ness. “In cross-examination, prosecutrix ad-
mitted previous acts of familiarity with the same
youths,” whereupon the jury dropped the curtain
on the farcical proceedings. The first question
that arises from this common or paddock case is
not the question whether the profligate fool of a
girl should be punished for her prosecution of her
boy friends (though that is an important ques-
tion), but whether the police who took the charge
and did their best to secure the conviction of the
prisoners, should be called upon to justify their
action in a law court. What the girl admitted
under a barrister’s cross-examination can hardly
have been a secret from the police, who
were practically championing her virtue. The
true character of the complainant in these
outrage cases is usually known to the police. The
history of criminal assaultery bristles with in-
stances of police endeavor to send young men to
penal servitude, and get them “ catted,” if
possible, for robbing a disrespectable young hussy
of a treasure which she didn’t possess. It may be
that in this case the girl deceived the police,
and the prosecution was conducted with the
strictest regard for justice. But as often as not
the conviction of an alleged “outrager” is the
only fact which the so-called guardians of public
safety are anxious to arrive at. Ever ready to
assist a miscarriage of justice if it involves the
glory of “ working up a case,” a policeman lends
a large, willing ear to the improbable story of the
immoral young person whose innocence is as dear
to the law as her very life.

No charge yet laid against the Victorian Police
administration is half as serious as that contained
in a return prepared lately for the edification of
the Assembly—and the encouragement of the
malefactor. This is a Return of Undetected
Crime in ’O5, and it shows that in 47 cases of
serious crimes of violence there were 23 arrests ;
in the matters of abandoning children and con-
cealment ot birth there were 46 cases and only four
arrests pas to thefts of cattle, etc., there were 904
cases and only 42 arrests; as to robberies with
violence, 75 cases and 28 arrests ; as to burglaries,
housebreaking, etc., 2054 cases reported and
only 360 arrests; while as to plain larceny
of different sorts, 4262 cases were reported,
but only 440 arrests were made. Even
allowing for the departmental tally of “false
alarms,” there were 2972 genuine cases of petty
larceny reported, in only 324 of which were the
police efficient enough to capture somebody on
suspicion—the other 2648 persons simply lost
their property and informed the police, and got
no satisfaction. As for larceny from the person,
376 cases were proved to have occurred, and the
police managed to secure 27 individuals—just one
in 14 ! No wonder the pickpocket thrives in
Melbourne. Significantly enough, of the 7718
cases of crime listed, three only were for receiving,
and the force made one arrest! That damning
return scarifies the Victorian force worse than all
the blather of Judkins, Worrall and eo.; even
the evidence that the recent Police Commission
might have acquired could have shown the alleged
guardians of the peace in no worse light. Either
the Victorian police and detectives, as is freely
asserted, are in the pay of spielers and “guns, ’
or they are so incompetent or so badly officered
that they ought to be set to road-sweeping or
plain pick-and-shovel work.

Bill Lyne was moved to anger the other day,
and made no secret of the fact, when he came
across this paragraph in a manifesto issued by a
Tory Women’s League :
It will be disastrous if, by apathy and indifference in
neglecting to vote, you give a strong impetus to the
Socialistic scheme, which, in its logical sequence, will
deprive you of your homes, your loved ones, and of all
that makes life sweet and holy.
After all, is it worth while for Bill to be so very
angry? The alleged “ladies” who circulate
atrocious falsehoods about how the Labor party
proposes to destroy the marriage tie and break up
the home aren’t ladies, and they are hardly worth
calling women, and they certainly are awful liars,
but if Bill just decided to regard them as Dirt
and harridans, he could let things rest at that,
and it might ease his mind. There was a time in
this wicked old world when some of the present
crowd of Tory political women might possibly
have been ordered by law to undergo something
very unpleasant for slander and the circulation of
false reports, or something like that, but the
world isn’t so strenuous now.

Adelaide did an amazing thing, the other day,
when it polled half the votes on the Legislative
Council roll in the Central district. Mostly
because one candidate proposes to walk with one
foot on the kerbstone and the other in the gutter,
while the other candidate proposes to walk with
both feet in the gutter, 70 per cent, of S.
Australia stays away from its Legislative Council
elections ; this time, as there is a tremendous
crisis on hand as to whether a person should vote
if he has a £ls-a-year house, or whether nothing
less than about £l7 9s. lid. worth of premises
should do, it got excited, and 13,242 out of 25.2G1
electors turned up. Also, as a side-issue, it
turned CoheN down, and gave the vacant
seat to Laborite Jklley. So far as the elec-
tion proves anything in a general way, it
proves that even the Leg. Council electorate (the
gilded two-sevenths from out the Assembly elec-
torate) is ready to liberalise the absurd Council
franchise, which trives a vote to the jay who
starves his children or doesn’t pay his grocer in
order that he may live in a house that he can’t
afford, while it blocks the honest, unpretentious
man who lives in a little crib that isn’t littered
with unpaid bills. But, as the election was in
what is supposed to be the most democratic divi-
sion of tho State, the result doesn’t probably
mean much in a general way; for the seat
Jklley gets, Laborite Guthrie, of the Senate, held
for years. Still the fact chat, in even one district,
the privileged two-sevenths favor Reform to the
extent of a £l5 franchise, is pretty good proof of
what the answer will be when the vyhole seven-
sevenths are appealed to at the Assembly elections
on November 3.
It is mentioned by cable that the manner
and language of the Jap. ambassador, when he
interviewed U.S. Secretary of State Root to
demand the admission of Jap. children to. white
schools in California, was “very unusual.”
Seeing that the bullying Jap. declares the white
man unfit to own land in Japan, and heaps many
other, disabilities upon him, it is hard to see why
he should be so violently “ unusual ” when Uncle
Sam also draws a color line. It is about time
some European ambassador called on the Mikado

managed to reach the apparently distressed
steamer, the captain explained in a perfectly
friendly way, that he wanted 100 tons of coal
extra, and his message meant that Sydney was to
get itself prepared to supply this huge order,
Naturally, the tug swore. When the remarkable
captain reached port the Navigation authorities
found his life-boats so defective that they stopped
his ship from going to sea.' The means adopted
were a bit of blue paper, which the master pro-
fessed to regard in an amusing light. So he went
to sea on his own hook without a pilot, and
reached Melbourne. At Melbourne the authorities
were quite enthusiastic about the worthlessness
of his life-saving gear, and demanded an explana-
tion. The obtuse master’s retort was that their
old Yarra was a rotten sort of highway, and that
his propeller was nearly off because it had hit a
huge obstruction in the fairway. Careful examina-
tion failed to find the hidden danger, and the
Marine Board was going to say things when its
attention was distracted by one Gin Eat. Eat
was a,Mongolian seaman, and his complaint was
that the food and drink on board the Lord Antrim
were unfit for any respectable Chow. Gin’s
remarks were so free that the Marine Board
instituted proceedings on his behalf against the
master. These were interrupted in turn by the
arrival of a warrant arresting the skipper for
defying the bit of blue paper at Sydney, and
he was hurriedly fined £lOO. The tug which
rushed out with the coal is still swearing.

This revival of “The Christian” at Her
Majesty's, Sydney, comes when it may do some
good. Generally speaking, for the sake of the
dramatic moments in the piece, John Storm has
been accepted in a resigned way as a freak, and
therefore not a fit subject for one of the central
characters in a family melodrama. Often he
hasn’t appeared to be a type. But that was
wrong. True, you don’t every day meet a John
Storm-rushing off with white cheeks and tumbled
hair to murder a Glory Quayle; but, then,
you only had a chance of meeting John that
way once in his life; and when a person
only does a thing once in his life, and doesn’t
spend half-a-crown on an advt. to say that he is
going to do it, the chances of one’s being there
when he does it are pretty small. Storm is a
type—a type of that greatest of all humbugs, the
one who humbugs himself. He starts out with a
large stock of self-consciousness and enthusiasm.
It is a wicked world he is in, and he is good and
great. He is determined to shift big sins—he is
much-too good and great to be bothered with
little sins. So, to make sins worthy of
his efforts—in other word?, to feed his
own morbid pride—he invents large ones. And
the result? Well, he drives Glory Quayle,
the girl he loves in his ghoulish way, to the very
kerbstone. She is quite willing to step into the
gutter. And it isn’t John Storm who prevents
her; it is “worldly” Francis Drake. Australia
has lately grown quite a crop of fanatics of the
John Storm class. Perfectly honest humbugs
most of them —quite sincere, but humbugs none
the less—who have allowed themselves to drift
into hysterics, or have whipped themselves into
hysterics because they felt that they must fight
something Great and Horrible, even if it were
only a bogey built according to their own plans
and specifications. When Australia feels inclined
to whoop for these fanatics, it ought to consider
Glory Quayle standing on the kerbstone, ready to
step into a hansom and drive to the devil—the
very opposite road from that to which the fanatic’s
bony finger had pointed.
* * * *
Looking at it in the artistic way, this
revival is disappointing. Yet it only disappoints
because such high hopes had been built upon the
little that Miss Ola Humphrey did in “The
Squaw Man,’’ which little was done most charm-
ingly. Playgoers expected another Henrietta
Watson, the. finest Glory Australia has had,
taking one thing with another; and she doesn’t
materialise. Miss Humphrey’s reading of the
temptation scene—what time Glory considers
whether she will drive to the devil, and
decides that she will—is new and subtle;
but the dramatic situation that follows is
unconvincing. Charles Waldron, on the other
hand, exceeds expectations ; giving a good, sound,
even performance. Cyril Mackay is one of the
best Lord Robert Ures; Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis,
a satisfactory Mrs. Callender ; Cambourne, not
the Canon Wealthy he ought to be; and G. P.
Carey, Hardee Kirkland, and Plimmer stand out
in a caste which is almost uniformly good. Glory 5 s
frocking is credited with being something
extra—she certainly pleased an eye not trained
to millinery—but there is nothing extra
about the mounting in general ; and, as
usual, the representation of the street mob
doesn’t convey the desired impression. You
simply can’t feel the necessary thrill and awe at
the sight of ten or a dozen supers, who, judging
by the hum and buzz they have been making in
the distance, ought to be at least 500. The last
of the mob ought to be showing half-way through
the door, and then the audience might believe
that J.C.W. has hundreds more mob outside,
and can produce them if the ten or dozen on the
stage aren’t accepted as sufficient guarantee of
good faith.

“The Rake’s Wife,” introduced to Aus-
tralia on Saturday night at Sydney Criterion, by
Meynell and Gunn, bears a strong family resem-
blance to “The Fatal Wedding.” As in that
hymeneal horror, the fond wife is separated from
her husband for some years or months. The ab-
sence in this case is not due to any unjust sus-
picions on his part, but to the fact that he has
taken a mind to go raking for a spell. In time
he turns his coat-tails on the gilded haunts of
sin, and conies back to wifie, and all is
forgiven. The story is of the conventional type—
such as Marie Corelli would briefly relate in a
400-page novel. No effort is made to keep within
the bounds of reasonable probability in working
up the situations; and there isn’t a trace of
literary flavor or real imagination in the whole
piece. That is to say, in brief, there are all the
elements of a great popular success.
* * * *
“ The Rake’s Wife ” introduces to Sydney
a new leading man, Conway Wingfield, whose
acting has some very good features. He is quiet
and natural most of the time, and when he is
passionate he doesn’t fill the air with
the tatters of a passion, but gives some-
thing fairly resembling the real article. Miss
May Congdon. as Midge Barnett, the Rake’s
Wife (or Mrs. Rake for short), is also very good in
patches. This actress has some emotional power,
and with more training should amount to a stage
figure of some importance. Maisie Posner does
not get as good a show as in “ The Fatal Wed-
ding,” but she acts and sings brightly in a minor
part, with a gay horde of youngsters to assist.
Maggie Dickenson is a brightly funny feature of
the children’s party. Smaller roles fall to Miss
Roland Watt-Phillips, Miss Amy Singleton and
Miss Ida Gresham. Taken altogether, “The
Rake’s Wife” is acted in an earnest and in-
teresting fashion. There is some lack of polish ;
but there is also a lack of that tired feeling
sometimes noticeable in long-established cos. In
some instances it is a very graceful and finished sort
of weariness—the weariness of people who.
through long acquaintance, act perfectly together
but are sorry at the very sight of each other.
The Bulletin really doesn’t know whether the
finished or unfinished weariness is the worse.

“A Sailor’s Knot” will pass away from
Sydney Royal, on Friday, and be followed by
“The Betting Book” on Saturday. Probably
betting books will be a sore point with many of
the public next week ; but there should be enough
winners to fill Bland Holt’s theatre. (If, between
now and Saturday, the law decides that the new
drama is equivalent to publishing the odds, and
forbids its appearance, the probabilities are that
the “Knot” will run another week while the
astonished Bland gets his second wind.)

Harry Tate’s motor sketch is still the large
potato at Sydney Tivoli. The languid motorist,
the chauffeur with the vast capacity for talking
motor-car and not the least capacity for under-
standing one, the mild Johnny-son on his way to
be a naval cadet, the small boy who turns up to
be a general nuisance—they are characters that
you don’t find in more than one farce in a
thousand. In this as in other respects the bill is
still last week’s document; but Commander
Rickards, back once more from foreign parts,
mentions that within a few days the heavens will
begin to pour down new stars of unusual magni-
tude, and constellations of great price will rebound
from the Tivoli stage as casually as if it were
raining grasshoppers.

“The Shop Girl” is putting in a week of
inevitable prosperity at Her Majesty’s (Melb.),
and concerning the weakness of that passing
event it is not necessary to enter into details.
Years ago “The Shop Girl” was played by a
company whose members tried hard to give
strength of character to their respective parts,
but the attempt failed all along the line. The
plot is too foolish to permit of much suggestion
of humorous possibility in the plotters, and the
present performance by Lauri, Bantoek, Roberts,
Percy, Hunter, Twitcbin, Leslie, Miss Young and
Miss Clifton makes the gaudy entertaiment less
of a spineless comedy and more of a variety show
than it appeared aforetime. The drapery store
might as well be a bun-factory for all that Lauri
and Bantoek do with their limited opportunities
for caricature. Also Miss Clifton is more like a
trim and comely matron with a small banking
account than a young country bumpkiness sum-
moned hastily from a draper’s work-room. But
this is going into details. There are a number of
“ turns ” for the principals in “The Shop Girl,”
and there is a chorus—the Williamson Comic
Opera chorus—good to listen to, and good to look at.
Such a fine assortment of melodious girl deserves
a brighter piece than it will get to-night (Thurs-
day) and to-morrow. On Saturday the first pro-
duction of “The Spring Chicken” will enable
Melbourne to form its own ideas re the alleged
giddiness of that musical comedy. A British
Judkins lately found fault with the “Chicken’s”
moral tone or something, and Melbourne hopes
to have the pleasure of discovering a satisfactory
explanation of the Judkins indictment.
“JUD” NOT: AN ADDRESS TO A SHOWMAN.

But dreadful is our fate ;
For oh, the times are jawful 1
The Jud is at our gate !
The Jud, the social gimlet,
A Purist of the pure,
With sermonette and hymnlet
Is here, our souls to cure.
And all our local sinners
Are shaking in their shoes ;
The tipsters of “ the winners,”
The devotees of booze,
The Bridge and poker players
With apprehension thrill,
For Puritans are stayers,
And Jud is “ out to kill.”
Ah, deafening Jud, have pity !
We’ve cranks here of our own.
Remain in Yarra’s city,
And let our faults alone.
Remain in Yarra's city,
Her erring souls to win
From crooked paths and gritty ;
Yes, cleanse her, first, from sin.
Well lave that Augean stable ;
Let Alpheus run through ;
And then, if you are able,
Come, help to wash us, too.
For penitent and lowly
Our Sydney you may view,
When Melbourne walks, all holy,
To heaven because of you.
Far, far too scarce among us
Are they, the tolerant,
Whose taunts have never stung us,
Who meddle not, nor cant;
But, deep in their own labors,
Content, have never budged
To Worrall at their neighbors,
Nor Jud, lest they be judged.

Victoria discovered last week several milk
beastlinesses. The Board of Public Health made
the acquaintance of a cow which was doing a
thriving trade with the parents of infants whose
doctors had recommended “milk from one cow
only.” That remarkable cow was suffering
from tuberculosis —still it was certainly “ one cow
only.” An old lady in Richmond, who makes her
humble living by selling goats’ milk, was found to
have two goats in a kitchen which was “an inch
thick with dirt,” and seven goats and 50 fowls in
a filthy yard and passage-way. The aged dame
said she was going to scrub the house out as soon
as the floor deposit wrfs dry. Finally, the Agri-
cultural Department produced a bottle full of
awful dirt, being what was left after the milk
from a shire-supervised factory had been strained
through muslin—the dirt was so fertile that the
matter was a strictly agricultural one. This filth
came off the cow and the man who was milking
it. Victoria is drinking some very thick sub-
stances nowadays.
Brilliant weather, gay dresses, and radiant
girls within them, seem a cert, for Melbourne Cup.
These delightful institutions are sure winners of
Man’s affections every time. Also, D.C.L.
Whisky is always first favorite in the race for the
refreshment bar. Wherever there be bright girls,
good horse racing and D.C.L. whisky there is
always a cloudless skv and a sure win for Wise
Delight.*

The last week of Johnny Sheridan and
Co. at Melbourne Royal has brought “ The Lady
Slavey” back to light. The “Slavey/ m the
first act, is a plain, old-fashioned joke expressed
in the crudest form of dialogue, and altogether
suitable to a company that is no great shakes. As
long as it has a continuous story to hold, on to
the co. seems equal to its responsibilities.
In the second act the story breaks up, and
then the audience feels that. the end of
the present season is not coming too soon.
On Saturday the amphitheatre will be crowded
as of yore, and the stalls and dress circle will
rejoice over the return of the Anderson Dramatic
Co., for the Andersonian public has gone six
weeks without any battle, murder, or sudden
death, and its little mental Mary is rumbling for
food. A revival of “The Ladder of Life” will
fill the aching void. Four years have elapsed since
the last Melbourne revival of that incredible melo-
drama, and The Bulletin hopes the hand of time
has touched it artistically.

At Melbourne Princess’s a weird, squeaky
small boy is still impersonating an impish baby in
short petticoats. “ The Little Stranger ” doesn’t
improve on acquaintance, but it has been relieved
of a few of its dullest lines, and the duplicate
baby is now a human figure instead of a doll. A
smart wu-iter could have constructed an uncom-
monly humorous farcical comedy around the
mannikin character. The author of “ The Little
Stranger ” put his novel idea into a cheap, not to
say nasty, setting, and the effect is about as
strikingly absurd as a misdirected egg at an
election meeting.

Wirth’s Circus, way down Alexandra
Avenue, continues to make much capital out of
the animal that keeps the Gambling Evil going.
Melbourne wants all the horse it can get at this
sinful season, and the heart of the vast congrega-
tion in the Wirth tent goes out to brother
Phil when he puts questions to an educated
grey, and the fine massive steed talks back
at him with its forelimb, its powers of
conversation being strictly confined to the
same one leg. An act of hurricane hurdling,
a high-jumping turn and a horse ballet are other
seasonable features which will shortly be over-
shadowed by “a Wonderful 60 Horse Act.”
Sometime after Cup Day, when a lot of people
are suffering a bitter momentary prejudice against
Australia’s national quadruped, the Circus will
introduce Marvellous Lloyd, who dances on the
corde elastique. This appears to be one of those
astounding feats in the arena which no English
language can adequately express.

At Fitzgerald’s Building, the other circus
(which is a stage) offers the same cheerful variety
show as before. These are the last weeks of
Bostock and Wornbwell management in Australia,
and when the human co. is presently disbanded the
menagerie also will be dispersed. Anyone in heed of
ablue-nosed gorilla valued at £250, had better make
anoteof this fact. Meanwhile, theß. and W. advt. is
loaded with allurements. Children are invited
to write essays on the menagerie in consideration
of twenty guineas in prizes, and the professor of
hypnotism, who puts his myrmidon to sleep, has
kindly undertaken to drop a ton of stone, more or
less, upon the sleeper’s chest for the amusement
of any stone-breaker present.
At Melbourne Opera House the co. in-
cludes all the people lately mentioned in this
column, plus Stewart and Lorraine, who play on
musical instruments. “La Moto Girl” figures as
the principal item. The Cabiacs and the Alaskas
shine in the acrobatic department, and Larry
Lewis, likewise the Gaumont Chronophone, are
received with thanks.

Dreamland is to present a number of
amazing attractions to the Melbourne public for
the first time on Friday night, when Thomas Bent

Princes Court resumed business last Saturday,

Adelaide amusements mostly consist of
one-woman shows just now. Amy Sherwin’s
brilliant vocalism has been succeeded at the Town
Hall by Annie Mayor’s quick-change elocution
and character-impersonations, while the Royal is
about to re-open with Blanche Arral’s operatic
selections. Meanwhile, a so-called Hippodrome
has opened next door to the Central Market, and
proposes to give variety shows open to the starry
sky. Why this sort of thing should be a Hippo-
drome rather than a Hippopotamus is not too
clear.
AT POVERTY POINT.
A WAIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The executive of the A.N.A. has decided to strictly
limit the performances in the fancy-dancing exhibitions.
Anj’ competitor indulging in unnecessary high-kicking
will be immediately “ rung off.” —Press item,.
So they’ll limit the leg-competition;
The virtuous, good A.N.A. ?
Who would gain her the premier position,
Little lingerie and hose must display ;
If there’s more than a hint of her stocking,
Or her feet she doth flourish with zest,
Some wisp-whiskered Native she’s shocking,
On his hoofs he will rise and protest.
And the rest ?
They will curse him in language unblest.
Will they trifle, these Goths, with our feeling,
Will they make them a butt for our scoff ?
Just because Flossie’s toes smite the ceiling—
Will a jaded old judge shoo her off?
Aye, won’t there be weeping and skirling.
If, just as Suzette’s going well,
And her limbs in a whirlwind are whirling.
There cometh the call of the bell !
Twill be, “ Hell
To the fiend that ringeth her knell! ”
Let us hire them, these dull, drab-souled fellows,
A hall, where in peace they can sit,
While long-skirted prudes in prunellas
Dance like witches returned from the Pit;
Let them leave us the whole exhibition,
With its lithe, lissome lasses athrong.
If these things pave the path to Perdition,
May the path to Perdition be long ;
And the gong
Will stay not the dance nor the song.
VI o, Robert N. Crawford.
“ J.A.O.” : I knew poor old William Larmour, poisoned
last week in Sydney through drinking a solution of
chloride of mercury, very well.
He was, if I mistake not, a
North of Ireland man, although
a scion of an old Scoto-French
commercial family—Larmour
in France, and Lorimer in Scot-
land. When he came to Aus-
tralia he was, comparatively
speaking, a rich man, but by
unfortunate business ventures,
and bv his Coogee Aquarium,
lie lost pretty well everything.
Over £6OJO vanished in the
disastrous Aquarium spec.
During the first Sydney plague
scare Larmour was appointed a
sanitary inspector. His man-
ner of inspection was suave—
he harried no one. His
methods may not have been
those originally contemplated
by the Board of Health, but
he did his work efficiently all
the same. He afterwards took
to manufacturing disinfect-
ants, but his clients were not
taking much interest in dis-
infection, and the business was
no( a success. Whether his
death was the result of acci-
dent or design can only be
surmised. I incline to the
former supposition, for he ap-
peared to me to be of too
joyous and humorous a dis-
position to contemplate sui-
cide. His disinfecting busi-
ness would account for his
having corrosive sublimate,
one of the. most powerful
antiseptics known, in his pos-
session. An instance of his
humor: A youthful Hindu,
domiciled in' Sydney, was ob-
sessed by the idea that he was
the possessor of a wonderful
tenor voice, and only wanted
a “ show ” to become famous.
Larmour, who regarded him
as an animated joke, gave him
a show at the Aquarium, and
put his name on the programme
as “ the eminent Indian
vocalist, Damporesingah.”
Died, on Sunday, in Melbourne Hospital, Myra Kemble,
unquestionably one of the finest actresses the Australian
stage has produced. She was a beautiful woman, talented
and versatile, and was equally at home in impassioned and
in humorous parts. She was born in Sligo, Ireland, and
came to Australia when she was seven years of age.
While very young she drifted on to the stage, walked on
in burlesque and that sort of thing, until, at Melbourne
Theatre Royal, under the management of Harwood,
Stewart, Hennings, and Ooppin, she got her first show'
of any importance, as Venus in the transformation
scene of a pantomime. This was somewhere about 75.
She had nothing to say, but, as a vision of beauty, she
became the talk of the town. After that she went
steadily ahead, got parts of more or less importance—her
first preceptor being Harry Leston, well-known amongst
us—and adopted her st ge name of Myra Kemble. Her
real name was Maria Gill. When Bland Holt made his
managerial debut in Australia, at Melbourne Royal, with
“ New Babylon,” in 1880, she doubled the leading women
parts of Beile Lorimer and Eunice Maltby, characters dia-
metrically apart in character, with great success. She also
made a great hit in Wybert Reeve’s production of “ The
Woman in White.” She married “Jim” White, one of
the straightest of the straight “bookies” of Australia—
too straight to make much out of “the game”—and
together they visited her native town of Sligo. By con-
trast with Australia, the poverty she saw' there
terrified her, and she longed to return forthwith.
She made many successful appearances through-
out the United Kingdom. When she came back
she brought with her the rights of “Dr. Bill,” and Bulletin
readers will have a kindly remembrance of her in that
play. Kind-hearted Myra will be regretted by many in
“ the profession ’’and out of it. Though her star was
dimmed for some years before her death, Australia was
very far from having forgotten her. She was a national
institution at one time like “Our Nellie.” Some years
ago a Sydney paper—one of those which take plebiscites
about the Ten Best Citizens or the 12£ Largest Turnips—
had a lucid interval, and took a vote of its readers as to
the most popular Australian actress. Myra Kemble won
by a street.
In one of the opera choruses just now, the greatest in-
terest (next to getting on the stage in time) is to W'atch
the behaviour of the Very Leading Lady w'hile the tenor
makes cooing stage love to a younger and prettier
mummeress. The tenor teaches the youthful songstress
how to love in a manner rather less lackadaisical than
usual. The Very Leading Lady bears it heroically, re-
marking that she knows it is only done “ to tease,” but
this did not prevent her from an acid feminine exclama-
tion one night recently—“ Little beast!” Whereat the
chorus chuckled gleefully.
The Salvarmy nows earns the casual copper by playing-
national airs fitted with blood and fire songs. “ God
Save the King” makes a lovely Salvarmy hymn. One
can almost picture, when hearing it, a repentant and
chastened Ned VII. in the ring adding his hard-sworn
testimony to the other howls of the saved.
Melb. Theatre Royal has been leased to Meynell and
Gunn for five years, at 100 guineas a week. This is a fair
bargain. The theatre is the only decent-sized, centrally-
situated house in Melbourne, and is cheap at £5460 a year,
if merely for sub-letting purposes. Meynell and Gunn,
however' intend to use the building themselves, as much
as possible, and there will be room for them, since Bland
Holt is going out of the business, for a time at least.
He leaves for England next year. William Ander-
son was one of the other tenderers, but the
genial Bill altogether under-estimated the value of the
Royal. Under the new lease the co. gets a handsome
return on the £15,000 it spent (egged on by the Board of
Health) in altering and improving the building. Holt
paid £BO a week under the old lease, made in the days of
George Coppin, and the company will now get £I3OO a
year additional on its £15,000. Interest at 8J per cent,
is not to be sneezed at. Shares in the Theatre Royal Cos.
jumped last week from 6s. 6d. to Bs.
One of the Bresicans died a few weeks ago. It was the
benign elder of the musical party, the one who wore
glasses, and walked abroad without a hat on his head.
“ Stargazer ” : Imported theatrical companies often
serve a viseful purpose in giving hitherto unheard-of or
little-considered Australian pros, an opportunity of
shining. In Meynell and Gunn’s “ new English comedy
company ” there is an Australian actress whom I do not
recollect having seen before —Miss Guildford Quinn. She
plays the part of the nurse, dumbfounded by the antics
of the amazing kid, and does it so well as to be easily
first when one sizes up the merits of the whole co.
Apparently the part was considered of no account,
otherwise it is not likely it would have found its way into
the hands of a local actress with no reputation ; but as it
was acted it loomed as the best comedy part in the farce.
These reflections exclude the small boy who figures as the
elderly infant. He is a stage freak, and useless for
purposes of comparison.
“ Snell ” : There’s a good serviceable idea in “ The Little
Stranger,” now showing at Melbourne Princess, but the
author has not put it to its best use. The notion of a
family suddenly realising that its baby, up to then inno-
cent and inarticulate, has developed in an instant into a
small fiend, elderly in iniquity, with a man’s appetite for
whisky and roast beef, and an impish proclivity for play-
ing up Old Harry with the domestic economy, has possi-
bilities as a knock-about farce, but the maker of “ The
Little Stranger ” has sailed too close to the wind, and,
when the fun should be fast and furious, the onlooker is
not sure that it is not tragedy he is asked to laugh
at. The horror of the distracted mother, who finds her
baby has become old and infamous in an hour, is a phase
a cute maker of comedies would have dodged.
THE LATE MISS MYRA KEMBLE.
Judging from some daily paper notices of the gorgeous
“ Winter Tale ” production in London last month, one
may assume that Beerbohm Tree’s influence with the
press is not quite an irresistible force. One critic says :
“ Long before the final curtain fell at Her Majesty’s last
Saturday, an air of weariness was stealing over the great
audience. . . . Mr. Tree went astray when he entrusted
the part of Perdita to Miss Viola Tree. ... It must be
obvious to those who will pause to consider the matter,
that Miss Ellen Terry was not born to play Hermione.
Miss Terry has won her way to the hearts of all English-
speaking playgoers by the radiant warmth of her sunny
nature, by her impulsiveness, &c., &c., and it is these
very qualities that render her unsuitable for the part of
Hermione, whose one outstanding attribute was a
majestic dignity which nothing could destroy.” He adds,
“ We thought Mr. Julius Knight’s Polixenes too stagey.”
Doubtless the Australian idol was too stagey, although
his staginess has been accepted as next to godliness in
Australia.
“L.”: Two theatrical turns in Melbourne just now
betray how crude and unfinished is the average British
mummery. One is the acrobatic show of Les Deux
Cabiacs (the management advertises them as “LesTwjo
Oabiacs”) at the Opera House; the other, the Japanese
Lukishima “family” at B. and W.’s Circus. The Luki-
shimas are precise, solemn, and formal in their setting ;
the Cabiacs are quick, eccentric, and dainty. But each
turn has an artistic finish and completeness which make
one go away cursing the slununocky, slovenly business
which is generally brought to Australia from the London
music-halls, where they spoil good performances with
incongruous buffoonery.
“ Hiphen ” : As I was starting for the Williams-Cripps
embroglio last Monday night, a lady friend of mine who
learns singing (or, rather, who take' lessons)insisted that
I should accompany her to the Blanche Arral concert.
To abbreviate a long and painful argument I went, feel-
ing as angry as an egg-spattered social reformer. During
the first two rounds, during which I can now see that
the diva was merely sparring for wind, 1 thought of how
Messrs. Williams and Cripps were at that moment tossing
for corners, and I groaned aloud in my anguish. In the
third round the French lady, coming up very fresh, got
in some good work ; and though I did not understand all
the points and conditions of her game, the Cripps.
Williams disturbance began less and less to occupy my
mind. The way she shaped in the 4th, sth and 6th
rounds roused me out of the sloth of despondency into
which I had slothed, and when she went to her corner at
the end of the seventh, aftersome fast and brilliant work,
I rose in my seat with the crowd and cheered till my
stomach ached. (I always cheer with my stomach.) In
the next round she seemed to have weakened. Her voice
died away to a soft whisper, and I made certain she was
out. But it was only ring-craft. She rallied, and came
at it again till her top note drowned the band. It was
fine. I’ve seen some of the best performers here ; but for
quickness, gameness and general finish, I’ve never seen
anything at her weight to equal the French lady. When
she is next engaged, you will find me in her corner.
Andrew Black, it seems, has no immediate intention of
returning to Britain, where he cancelled all bis concert
dates before booking his passage for Australia. The
genial baritone, suffering from the loss of his wife, was
advised to take a long sea voyage, and now that he has
completed the tour for which he booked himself with the
Taits, he is disposed to linger on for pleasure rather than
profit. Of late he has lived in Melbourne, appearing
occasionally at the Town Hall, or accepting any up-
country engagement which promised an interesting trip.
The most comfortable profession in the world is that of
the concert singer, such as Andrew Black, who has built
up a banking account whilst earning a big reputation.
A wild discussion is raging in the papers published
amid the wide pastoral plains of the township of London,
as to the proper side for milking a cow. In the new play
at Drury Lane there is a real cow, and the operation
of milking the animal was condemned by various
critics as being wrong-side-on. Then came experts with
various views, thus: (1) “Nearside "for a horse is offside
for a cow. (2) Some cows will only consent to be milked
on one side, some on the other. (3) No cow cares a bit
which side it is milked on, and in every large yard the
alternate animals are handled from different sides, as a
matter of course. (4) There is only one proper side, and
the stage milker was on it.
“Cockaigne” (hysterically, from London): “Come
along,” says Harry Rickards, “and have a look at the
Pavilion.” What of the night ? Not foggy, but of gleam-
ing electric orbs creating a golden mist. The Londony
spirit is upon me. Whatever I am going to see is the
greatest show on earth. I have wrapped myself round
its best dinner. “ Oh, the Roast Beef of Old England .
I sigh. “ Wrong,” exclaimed a hatchet-faced personage
“ it’s Chicago 1 ” Now for this Pav., and on the
stage, with the din of the orchestra on the other
side of the plush curtain. What a maraschino, and
champagne, with the bubbly beads of hilarity running
up the amber liquid ! However can people quaff this air
night after night ? How heady ! I’m in a gipsy masque,
an acted dream, quintessence of the bizarre. The curtain
shrivels and rustles up. There are the float lights, and
those up each side of the proscenium inside. The audito-
rium darkens, and the performers act to a noijsy ghostland.
At the wings are themotleys awaiting their turns, crowding
and peeping. It is that scene of the opeia house in “The
Corsican Brothers ” which 150 men shifted in two minutes
to the glade of Fontainebleau, in Irving’s production.
The cool stage manager, in a brown tweed suit, is listen-
ing to the nervous and hurried front, manager, in evening
dress, with the inevitable spark in front of his clean
boiled rag, as ArtemuS Ward would say. He scurries
away, and the stage manager glances, in a nonchalant
fashion, up at the written programme, pinned to the first
side scene. The clockwork is to go by itself. “Hallo,
Jimmy 1 Dash it all ! ” exclaims a polichinelle at my
elbow to an acrobat in salmon tights. The human port-
folio, whose contents are to be poured on the boards,
opens with a rush in of the Cragg Family. Hi-yah !
Houp-la! A front canvas drops, and, of course, I
cannot see the Venetian picture at the other side,
only pin-points of light through the seams. A well-
known feminine voice is heard. She begins with “ Look
here ! ” and there is a roar. Peggy Pryde ! Go round to
the front. What a spectacle. The throng as lively as
slippery eels, or a netful of silvery, bounding her-
rings, just dragged out of the ocean, over the side ol
a Yarmouth fishing smack. I have a sensation not alto-
gether removed from fear, such as you feel at the Epsom
Derby or Petticoat Lane. The world is there as well as
London, but London dominates. Such exhilaration !
The stranger is accosted as Johnson, Thompson, Cully,
Geezer, Baldy, or something. “’Ullo, Cholly, where
from?” “’Oxton.” “’Ow many days out?” It is
Freemasonry all round, except with the foreigner. Well,
the excitable, revolutionary-looking crowd will be all as
humble as mice at their work to-morrow.
“High Art”: Evangelical Editor Stead’s raptures on
Miss Pansy Montague’s living-statue turn at London
Pavilion are most diverting. He gloats on La Milo's
“ exquisite proportions.” Evidently the editorial evan-
gelist is very susceptible to the beauties of the female
form divine, when it comes on him suddenly in his old
age • but one is inclined to snigger, for, after all, and
since truth is mighty, the Milo presents a purely music-
hall Venus and a truly vaudeville Hebe. Miss Montague’s
figure despite the published measurements, is lament-
ably over-accentuated in the middle distance. Her Venus
is “ hippy.” It is the sort of Venus to delight a music-
hall audience, but it makes me grin to hear elderly and
inexperienced moralists excusing their raptures with
gabble about Art.
“Snell”: A Melbourne organist, who can afford to
keep monkeys, has a small one dressed as a soldier, which
takes round the plate in the intervals. Jacko has been
trained to take off his small bowler hat to every contri-
butor and I noticed, the other day, that the animal was
quite ’bald. It is a hint to tailless monkeys of larger
growth who wear tight hats.
“The Funny Side of the Street,” Marshall P. Wilder's
latest book, dealing with various celebrities, brings the
X ravs to bear on the story of Mary Anderson and King
Ned—the then Prince of Wales. The current yarn was
that the marble Mary, who was a model of icy chasteness
and beauty, declined, on principle, to be presented to his
gay Highness, particularly as his consort was not with
him. The true story, Wilder avers, was that Miss
Anderson’s guardian declined the honor for fear the
greatness of it would upset her. Probably this is the
true version. It is certainly more in accord with female
nature.
More of the beauties of Private Enterprise : Said now
that the recent “ pogroms,” or organised massacres of the
negroes, in some of the cities of the Southern. U.S.A.
were organised by people interested in the moving pic-
ture business!

SOCIETY
It is proposed in Maoriland to found an
association that will train and certificate domestics,
and provide them with homes when out of kitchen
harness, on the lines of those supplied to the
nursing profession. The idea is to lift domestic
service from the gutter into which it has been
pushed by bad servants and worse mistresses, and
make it a profession in which the certificate of
competency will cause its holder to be recognised
as something like an expert. A good idea, but
there will be some awful argu-
ments before the average woman
will be induced to regard a domes-
tic servant as anything else than
a “slavey.”
THEOLOGY.
MASTER (of a religious
turn, instructing his
pupils in the Old
Testament): “ Now,
then, tell me the names of some prophets.”
(Great consternation in class, and some exhibition
of envy and malice as a boy puts his hand up.)
MASTER (evidently surprised and pleased):
“ Well?”
BOY (proudly): “ Please, sir, Mr. ’Unt up at the
Observatory, sir.”
Melbourne solicitors—-sevenof them—have
been made the victims of a confidence trick by
Hugh Matthews. Hugh got three months. He
deserves also a decoration for his courage. The
man who would exact money from lawyers by the
confidence trick would dice with sharks for their
teeth.
Thoiigli the cablegrarrimer somewhat mixed
tip the names, it appears that it is really that
bright, young, temporary daughter of Australia,
Mrs, i Martell, once, a candidate for Parliament
who is in some trouble in London for
being a loud and disorderly female suffragist.
And the lady seems to be such a mighty bad
advertisement that this country would hardly
object if its bright, young daughter had got into
more trouble. The suffragists appear to have
held a sort of witch carnival in the neighborhood
of Parliament House, London ; and they waved
banners and went into hysterics, and repulsed the
police, who retired in a clawed condition. A
second attempt on the part of the force led to the
dispersal of the rank and file of the meeting ; after
fighting valiantly it fled hatless, with its hair down,
its bodice torn, its skirt trailing behind it, and
its mouth full of screams. The leaders, however,
clawed to the last, and were carried away kicking
and shouting, and making an unholy display of
their stockings and ankles. And when one reads
that the prisoners included Mrs. Oobden Saunder-
son (a daughter of the Foreign-trade person), Miss
Gawthorpe, Miss Kenney, Miss Billihgtqh ahd
Miss Pankhurst, he Feels that lie doesn’t
want to see theft ankles. Nb Pnte takfes
any interest in the tinkles Pf Miss Billihgton
or Miss Pankhurst. In fact, till this display ttf
the ankles and socks of Miss PankhlirSt reads like
a grievous mistake. If the British totmiah isn’t
content to run her campaign On quiet, persuasive
methods, the next best thing to do is to get her
gun and shoot calmly and desperately, and theh
go and be hanged quietly, in nice clothes, with her
hair in perfect order, merely remarking on the
scaffold that she doesn’t regret what she has done.
One way she would be a dignified remonstrance ;
theotherwnyshe would beadignified tragedy. But
the spectac'e of Miss Pankhurst with her clothes
disarranged and in rags, fighting two policemen
with her hat-pin, doesn t help any cause. When
the prisoners had calmed down" and pht their
wardrobe in order, they were offered their freedom
if they would Keep Cool for six months, blit they
declined to Keep Oool—in fact, they boiled oVer
again, and shouted at tno magistrate, and had to
be dragged by force from the dock, and they Went
to gaol to “ take it out.” Hereabouts the laW
also made a mistake. To send a woman to gaol
is taking her seriously, and, in a case like this, it
either shouldn’t take her at all, or should take her
humorously. The two simple alternatives were
--(1) Not to arrest anybody, but to disperse the
disorderly assemblage with the fireman’s hose ;
(2) to arrest Miss Pankhurst, and if she declined
to promise that she would Keep Cool, to sehd bet
to do her little term in an industrial school.

Charles Tucker, of Adelaide, M.L.A., ©Jr*
Mayor, and Customs agent, the best-dreSsfetl and
most affable man in the city, who ill his good days
asked everybody to have a drink, and Who now,
in his bad days, is charged with gigahtic Custohis
frauds, had a ghost in front of him at the police
court last week. One of the witnesses against
him was a one-time shipping clerk who often had
business with Tucker in his mayoral period, and
the affable Tucker generally asked him to have a
drink out of the mayoral bottle. One day Tucker
was even more affable than usual, and the clerk
had several drinks. Then he went back and
breathed Tucker’s excellent whisky on the firm,
and the firm didn’t want him any more.

The jealousies of those in high estate con-
tinue to delight the scoffers who frequent the law
courts in Lonsdale-street, Melbourne. The most
recent point of interest relates to the housing of
the High Court and State Court Judges. Pre-
vious to the appointment of Isaacs and Higgins,
the High Court Judges were so isolated that they
hardly came into contact with the State Judges.
At rare intervals, they might pass each other, like
strange dogs, in a eotridor, but they didn’t utter
friendly barks in their passing, and no tail-wag
was exchanged. Now, however, Justice Isaacs
has pegged out his allotment in two rooms over
the Supreme Court library, and to get to the
bench he must traverse the State Court Judges’
corridor. Madden is away, but is expected to
bark loudly when he comes back and finds a rteW
canine using his bit of footpath. He has already
declared that High Court Judges should not have
rooms opening on his sacred corridor, and when
he returns to find two of them —the men avho
reverse his decisions-—tramping right through the
holy aperture, he will probably take up a very
large attitude. Madden reckons that, as State
Chief Justice, he controls the premises, and there
may be an unseemly scuffle in the passage some
day.

Gisborne (M.L.) isn’t a happy town just
now. Awhile back, someone proposed to erect a
monument to Captain Cook, who took a turn
ashore thereabouts, and someone else
proposed a memorial to the farm-
burners who died in the Boer war.
With fine economy, the
few staunch Imperial-
ists who ran the busi-
ness, decided that
one granite slab
would serve both
purposes, and made
it Cook on one side
and Cohentingen-
ter on the other.
Then they looked
round for applause,
and were wilted up
by a deep disapproving
silence. The folks of
sleepy Gisborne are not
so proud of their farm-
burners as they were- The
hero away at the war, burn-
ing, hollering and banging
and upholding the Flag, is one tiling.
But the returned hero is apt to be unsettled and
full of the beer-craving, and he breaks too often
into the conversation to tell how he did things at
Bullockfontein, and the people who know him
best would fain forget him most.

Melbourne Hospital is always distinguish-
ing itself. ■ Either men with' broken 'skulls are
being sent away with a contemptuous “ Pouf,” or
wild drunks are being admitted with all the
luxuries of the season and put under chloroform
to have their beer amputated, or restless patients
are seeking salvation through the windows. The
last achievement was that of a delirious patient
who fled through the casement on to the asphalt,
12ft. below, and the fledder died. It is probably
too much to ask that a patient’s right to jump
where he likes should be interfered with, but it is
advisable that long grass should be planted under
all the windows at this hospital.
A Wronged man.
“ Can you give vic a little off Mr: Snipps account, sir ? Been awing three months now .”

The Executive in Adelaide is sitting up
late these nights with ice on its head considering
the case of. Natala Habibulla. Mr. Habibullawas
the Afghan, or Pathan, gentleman who made up
his dead wife in various neat parcels and dropped
her in the Torrens. He took the parcels that
had been Mrs. Habibulla to the river in a blood-
stained buggy; and; dS hb qjuitte frit-got td tie tip

that “ no malice had been shown ” —if Josiah him-
self were being cut up, he-would probably recog-
nise malice at once—the jury found Habibulla
guilty, but appended, curiously enough, a strong
recommendation to mercy. Then the Executive
laid in a lot of ice for-its head, and sat down to
consider that recommendation. At time of
writing, it had got through most of the ice, but
hadn’t decided about Habibulla.
America’s horror of the Child at the Loom
is just about equalled by Maoriland’s atrocity,
the Baby at the Udder. Wanganui Educational
Board has started a campaign against the bowelless
dairy farmers who sw r eat their own babies.
Men have been told off to investigate w'hy the
Taranaki children are so hopelessly dull and so
wholly unable to learn lessons. They tell a
hideous tale—names and addresses given—of
mere infants groping about in the frost and slush
on wintry mornings in crowdea cow-yards. The
youngest child mentioned in the report is aged
7\ years, and rises at 5 a. m. all the year round to
milk ten cows. He milks the same ten again in
the evening before starting on his home-lessons.
This sort of cow-farmer ought to be hanged by the
neck till his soul drops on to the fire-bars of
Tophet; but in the meantime a little penal servi-
tude with real hard labor might have a beneficial
effect, especially if accompanied by a heavy fine.
Since the coming of the motor launch the

Rev. George Tregear, the Melbourne
Methodist, who captured the girl that fled from
Abbotsford Convent, and flaunted her as a
trophy, has had further tidings of great joy to
announce. Another girl has escaped from the
convent, and sought sanctuary in the home of
the Rev. Tregear. The moral reformers in active
eruption in Melbourne just now are all specialists,
and runaway convent girls are Mr. Tregear’s
specialty. If his action results in an exodus from
convents and similar institutions, George may
admit his indiscretion in tears and tribulation,
for he will find his home overflowing with a mul-
titude of girls, and the number of girls that a
Methodist parson’s stipend can support is limited.
If the Rev. Tregear only knew how expensive
even one girl can be, he would pause in his wild
career of girl-accumulation. When his girls begin
to clamor for picture-hats and open-work stock-
ings and candy, he will be a ruined reverend.
“THE INSTRUCTIONAL CADAVER.”
An Australian Barrack-Room Ballad.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Senator Plavford has adopted ttie policy so frequently
urged with respect to the Instructional Cadre of the
R.A.A., brought into existence by General Hutton
against the advice of his subordinates. The cadre is to be
abolished. The men are to be absorbed by the Permanent
Artillery, and will be sent back to the fixed defences at
the different ports where their presence is needed.—Tiik
Aoe.
There is joy among their brothers ; yea, about three
hundred others
Are delighted, and excited, and most grateful;
And their mighty cheers are pealing up against the
canteen ceiling,
For they used to. curse “ The Cadre ” as most hateful;
They are choking it with cheers.
They are drowning it in beers,
They are weeping happy tears,
Their voices quaver;
For no longer they’ll be hunted,
Chased and chivied, pushed and punted,
By the Tyrants that they knew as “the Cadaver ”!
Orice they set ’em up on horses and propelled ’em through
their “courses”;
Made ’em ride and made ’em wriggle, hot and foolish ;
To ik ’em off the Nine-Point-Two, whose capacities they
knew,
And set ’em grooming horses fat and mulish ;
Taught ’em useless little runs,
Gave ’em silly little guns,
Firing shell as big as buns,
And—what was graver—
With their stupid frillery
Spoilt the fort artillery
To find work for the ’Structional Cadaver 1
Next they taught a lot of rot—at a thrilling, killing
trot —
To a corps that shone at heavy cannon-shooting 1
Took’em from the “fixed defences” on the thinnest of
pretences,
And Up and down the sandhills sent ’em scooting !
Made ’em ride about in trains—
Made ’em carry little canes—
Made ’em bang the horses manes
To make ’em braver !
But it only made ’em crusty
While the Nine-Point-Twos grew rusty
To the glory of the ’Structional Cadaver 1
Ah, well, here’s the R.I.P. of “ The Cadre ” ; by the sea
Once again the R.A.A. will soon be dwelling,
With the questing Nine-Point-Two gazing grimly on the
blue
For the raider who may need a little shelling.
Not a man will care a button
That “The Cadre’s” dead as mutton
(Though, of course, it will grieve Hutton
When he learns it).
For it’s hitting foes at sea
That will keep Australia free,
And the hitter’s worth good money, and he earns it.

The amazing tenderness of the Victorian
honorarium towards wife-beaters has naturally
encouraged those degenerates to special efforts.
The other day one of them in Richmond so
strenuously rebuked his five-weeks’ bride, a girl of
21, that she now lies in the Melbourne Hospital,
while he occupies a remand oell in the gaol
pending her recovery. The very next day the
saine constables were called to arrest another of the
species whose wife had stumbled to the police*
Stat on in a state of collapse. Her husband had
been “waiting for a job ” forseven weeks, while his
15-year-old son and his wife’s sister and mother had
keptthingsgoing—“all hehad contributed had been
bad language and blows.” The gentleman first got
annoyed because, after lying in|bed all day, he was
called to a tea of cold meat and potatoes. A‘ ‘ tray
bit ” for a refresher not being forthcoming, he
furiously assaulted his wife, and might have killed
her but that his little son happened, by pure acci-
dent, on that almost extinct animal, Policeman X.
All this was proved to two Richmond honorary
beaks, and there was practically no defence j also,
the police sergeant reminded tne lionoraries that
this was not defendant’s first offence, and that liis
wife would in no way suffer by his imprisonment,
as he didn’t support her—in fact, she would be
relieved of the cost of supporting him. Then the
honorary Solons told this violent loafer that he
should be ashamed of himself, and fined him .405.,
or 14 days. Whether he flogged his wife until
she produced the 405., or what else happened, this
piper knoweth not.
DIFFICULTIES BRUSHED AWAY.
HIM: “ M’ I hav’ th ’ pl ’ sure? ”
SHE: “ Thank you, I am engaged .”
HIM: “ Tha's nothing, I’m married.”
Judkins would no doubt feel embarrassed
if he knew how much support comes to the anti-
gambling movement from the publicans and
brewers, who are indignant that money which
should rightly be spent in drink is frittered
away in backing defunct poultry. A Sydney
brewer was holding forth against Judkins in a
suburban railway carriage, the other day, and a
sympathetic bystander happened to cast in an
observation complimentary to the integrity and
fearlessness of Wren. “Ah!” breathed the
brewer with a fiery sigh, “Judkins is on sound
ground there. He talks a lot of rot about the
drink traffic ; but he’s quite right in trying to
knock out Wren. The thousands of pounds that
man takes annually from the pockets of the work-
ing people is something appalling. Honest
artisans and clerks are ruined by this gambling
evil. They receive their wages on Saturday
morning, and the money’sallgonein the afternoon.”
A quiet man in the corner chipped in, “And
there’s nothing left for the poor publican on
Saturday night.” “Go to hell!” roared the
brewer.
The baby farm is a branch 'of agriculture
which is not yet quite'extinct in Sydney, though
it apprba'ches its end. Las't week three women
Were charged with this great national industry,
And in the most serious instance the agriculturist
got 18 months. As is usual in such cases, the
premises were of an arid character, arid the baby
that was planted there seldoin 'camel up. No jess
than eight infah'ts that had been found in the
street were supposed to have been dropped there
by the lady who is doing 18 months, so she was in
a fairly large way of business. Probably this lot
will be about the last of the ancient style of baby-
cultivator—the one who took an infant for a lump
sum, with no questions asked, and then left it in
the most adjacent lane. The law now prohibits
the lump-sum baby, but that infant was a great
industry while it lasted, and the advertisement
about it in the Evening News was once
quite a regular thing. The business had
curious ramifications and side issues. Probably
the most glaring alleged baby advertisement
that ever appeared in Sydney turned up long ago
in the same News ; it announced that the adver-
tiser wanted someone to adopt a girl of 13 or so,
but expected to receive a premium instead of pay-
ing one. It might almost as well have read : “To
Chinamen and Others—Girl for Sale.” So far as
The Bulletin knows, the police took no notice.
But that was in the riotous old days, before the
bank smash, and the Labor party and the deluge
—the days of the Cabbage Tree Mob, when
Sydney was in good training to be a very respect-
able Gomorrah, and almost anything was liable to
happen.

“Drifter”: Wi t n essed an tml'ehearsed scene
of a domestic tragedy, in a King*street (Sydney)
oyster saloon t’other night.
A well-dressed, middle-
aged man, accompanied by
a wanton-eyed, bejewelled
damsel, tripped up-stairs
into the light and glitter,
and commenced to make
merry over oysters and fizz,
Then a quietly-attired little
woman stepped up and
confronted the feasters.
The man Was in the act of
pouring out another glass
of Heidseick for the girl,
when he caught sight of
the little Woman bearing
down Upon him. The smile
died away from his face,
his jaw fell on the floor,
and, murmuring something
about “my wife !” he sat
like one suddenly struck
with a sand bag. “I’ve
found you, Jack ! ” said the
little woman—she was a
really pretty little woman
- —withaquietsmile. “Now
you will have to choose
between this person ”
pointing scornfully to the
painted Venus—“and me !
Are >ou staying here, or
coming home?” It
seemed as though the
room had suddenly be-
• come charged with
waves of electrical ex-
pectancy. Two giddy,
giggling couples at the
other tables waited and
watched, open-mouthed.
Even the Dago waiter
seemed to feel a tragedy
in the air, and stood
silently, clutching a pile
of dirty plates. With a
limited expression in his
eyes the husband glanced
round, as though he
wished the largest oyster
would swallow him. The
little woman turned, as
if to walk out, and the
man sprang to his feet
and reached for his
hat. “ I’m coming
with you, Nell,” he
said, and without so much
as a look at the girl oppo-
site, he put some money
on the table and took the
little woman’s arm, and
they passed into the roar
of the town. It looked like
the triumph of Virtue in
I Via fnnrV.h act of a melo-
drama. But I was sorry for Venus. She wept
tears of humiliation through her paint, and
looked as if she had really made the mistake of
caring for Jack. The painted woman who cares
is a failure.

“ Adelaide ” : What force there is in the
calm, unfaltering mis-statement! I said (B.
21/9/’O6) that in Adelaide the by-law against
spitting on pavements is enforced, and the habit
has died out It is. It has. The thing is a fact
—not even a matter for argument. Yet “G.
Elburg ” says (B. 18/10/’O6) that he counted
several millions of expectorations on one side of
King William-street alone, and that a constable
spat when appealed to. “G. Elburg” is a Six
Hatter or a Petriana myth, and a wanton fouler
of his own clean nest. Yet—since he puts his
fairy tale so brazenly—it may be that some will
believe him. Has he met any Large Capitalists
fleeing from S.A. on account of its non-existent
habits ?

on a recent night of glory. There came to a
restaurant in that street of saffron and smell a
bewchus maiden in tailor-made clothing—l have
seen her on the Block and at the theatres. She
had with her a cavalier—bell-toppered, tail-
coated, and eye-glassed. Such sights are rarely

gathered, and then-oh joy; the dude and the
duenna got to holts. A backhanded slash with an
umbrella sent the bell-topper into the gutter, and
another fierce wipe destroyed the eye-glass for
ever. In five minutes the back-hair of the
bewchus maiden was on the floor, and the dye was
all beaten out of the swallow-tailed one’s careful
moustache. The old dame was a mad and mur-
derous Maenad. I waited for days to see in the
police-court reports what all this meant, but
waited in vain. The. other glorious event of that
night was du y chronicled in the papers. It was
a scrum royal between a Mongol maiden and a
vulgar “ Yokohama ”-prance°d before the drab-
faced Caucasian, calling upon her to fight. There
was a wild and awful conflict of language, in which
China beat Europe by 1573 points Then, amid
a whirl of fists, a knife glittered in the saffron
hand, and an alarmed body of Chows and
draggled women stopped the tight. The end, in
the police court, was a fine for “Yokohama.” I
learn that China is sending a Grand High Man-
darin of the Lettuce-leaf to inquire into the con-
dition of the Mongols in Australia. I shall ’take
him to Lilly-buck, and introduce him to “ Yoko-
hama.” Then he will realise that a fairer and
more vigorous China is growing up beneath the
Southern Cross.

Education Commissioner Tate, of Victoria,
has been much worried lately by a man who wants
tobe appointed to the position of official enw-
hider of scholars in the State schools. He otters
tQ under takethe whipping of the kids at a shilling
a head, which sounds ridiculously high, unless it
is Is. per annum. In England, by the way, dur-
ing the early days of compulsory education, the
School Boards of one or two cities set to work
cheerfully to appoint a pub ij c kid-flogger,
w ho was to go round the schools daily or twice a
day, and make himself disliked. Pressure of
public opinion brought the scheme to nothing,
but the Boards were surprised that their idea
didn’t catch on. Up to that time education and
flogging had been synonymous terms in England
—at least, flogging had been synonymous if edu-
cation hadn’t.

The rate is becoming quite respectable. For many years
it was so low, considering the amount of public money of
which the bank had the use, that suspicion was thrown
on the assets, many of which looked to be over-valued, or
“ inoperative.” Possibly in thisseason of plentiful money
and high prices, some of the old skeletons have been
worked off, which would account for the jump in the rate
of profits. If, however, there have been realisations and
recoveries that way, there must have been very heavy
advances also; for, in spite of those probable realisations,
the advances have increased by over half-a-million in 12
months. The comparison which follows shows some de-
tails:—

Tne'se realisations of what at one time looked like dead-
horses are a very pleasant feature of recent banking ex-
perience, no doubt; they mean (1) an actual profit on
book value in many cases ; and (2), so far as they are con-
cerned, an end to the writing-down process which has
been going on for years. But the very conditions which
make realisations and profits possible make new advances
dangerous—unless, of course, the lesson of previous
booms has been learned, and very large margins for
safety are required on present values. Without
that caution, it is to be feared that much of
the recent greatly improved profits of banks may
turn out to be a sham in the end. And with so much
money lying in the banks, waiting for a return, it is not
the easiest thing, in the world to put in the peg low
enough.
Tlip rorogoing remarks are more general than par-
ticular ; they are, however, suggested by the fact that in
12 months the National has advanced not only the pro-
ceeds of whatever securities it may have realised, but
£506,851 besides. Still, other things being equal, it
would not be as deeply troubled by a slump as some
others, because even now it has very nearly 41 per cent,
of its liabilities to the public represented by liquid assets ;
while the public’s interests are further safeguarded by
the fact that shareholders’capital and reserves are suffi-
cient to write down all non-liquid assets by about 25* per
Considering the size of the business the capital is
pretty large ; that is the only thing that can be said in
extenuation of the increase of dividend and the provision
of so meagre a lay-by. Nevertheless, at a time like this,
when boom conditions unquestionably prevail, very ordi-
nary prudence would call for a lay-by of more than'23 per
cent, of the supposed profits.

The paid capital is now £85,402 ; twelve months ago it
was, including calls paid in advance, £84,067 ; for many
years before that it stood at £68,225. The new capital
represents calls upon shares issued some years ago ; and,
in view of the present dividend and the price of shares,
these calls really mean a considerable bonus to the
holders of those shares—which is one of the not very
numerous cases wherein contributing or partly-paid
shares turn out not to be loaded with something un-
pleasant. All the allotted shares (34,161) are now paid to
£2 10s. ; they are liable for a further £7 10s. ; and 15,839
snares are unallotted. For the past year profits have
been fairly well maintained, though the increase of
capital ha* to he remembered. In 1904, the least profit-
able of the preceding four years, capital and reserves
earned £ll Bs. per cent. ; in the past year they earned
only £9 7s. 6d. per cent. For this fall a higher expense
rate is partly responsible ; but the main factor has been a
larger accumulation of gilt-edged (and consequently low-
interest-bearing) investments for the security of insurers,
while the risks (judged by the premiums) have not yet
increased in proportion to the funds put into the business
during the last two years. The following comparison
shows 10 years’ progress :

In recent years there has been, as a rule, a lower loss
rate, gained to some extent at the cost of a higher ex-
pense rate, which latter means, no doubt, more careful
selection and supervision. The co. has £226,825 invested,
£61,360 of it in N.S.W. Government debentures(as against
£22,000 in 1904), £62,715 on deposit, and £56,000 in free-
holds. On the average of the amount invested, the year’s
interest earnings were at the rate of £3 ss. lOd. per
cent.—a low rate certainly, and suggesting that the
freeholds may be over-valued. But apart from them the
securities are an unusually liquid lot; and that is another
feature for insurers to think well of.

This is a very good profit for the off-season, and shows
that, up to the end of September, at any rate, some of
the public was still drinking beer. But, Judkins and
other mournful jokes aside, the public tendency
undoubtedly is to put a curb on the liquor traffic ; the
public to a great extent is, in fact, putting the curb on
itself. There is pretty good proof of that in the com-
parative poorness of present brewery figures, considering
the abundance of the last three seasons and the supposed
prevalence of money. A few years ago, under similar
conditions of prosperity, brewery and wine-and-spirit
profits would have been running a banker. It is, of
course, an open question whether there won’t be a swing-
back after the States’ present attack of Puritanism ; but,
generally speaking, it looks as though per head Australia
isn’t going to be worth as much to the brewing co. as it
used to be. Meantime, however, there has been more
solid progress even than the table above indicates. Here
are some further suggestions :

Note, in addition to the dividends paid out, the steady
accumulation of deposits, public securities, and similar
investments, and also stock. Certainly “ properties, good-
will, etc.’’ are reduced ; but that may he through amounts
written off out of profits, which would account for the
swelling of the more liquid items. Anyway, pro-
perty, plant, etc., though standing for less in the books,
earn apparently more now than they did in 1900; and
there is £80,547 of deposits, investments and stock to the
good in six years. The position looks well. The fly in
the beer is the doubt as to the future of the liquor trade.

Down to this year the Newcastle man was represented as
an amazingly regular drinker. The fact, however, appeared
to be that the co., finding itself with a heavy load of in-
different debts, set itself to write off as much as it could
after providing for a 4 per cent, dividend. This will show
better what happened :

In four years to September, 1905, the “ sundry debtors ”
item had been reduced by £21,419. A good deal of this
may have been actually collected ; but it looks as though
a good deal also was written off out of profits. In
the past year, with apparently less going out
that way (all the old rubbish may have been
cleared out of the hooks), the disclosed profits
show up better. Anyway, as pointed out a year
ago—and the remark stands good for another year—
the movement of the figures suggests a steady improve-
ment which wouldn’t be suspected from iooking at
merely the disclosed profits. 1 n five years, while £1984 of
debt has been paid off, £9766 has been added net to pro-
perties, plant, &c. (in spite of £15,000 having been written
off), £13,640 to hotels, and £5036 to bills, cash, &c.—a
total of £31,026. Ostensibly this has been almost counter-
balanced by reductions of the sundry debtors and stock
items ; but, under ordinary circumstances, the change is
very much for the better.

The profit on sales taken credit for is referred to by the
directors as “ the proportion of cash profits brought to
account on all sales made since revaluation,” so the profit
shown may have little or no connection with the
actual sales made during the year. No doubt most of
the sales are on time-payment ; so apparently if nothing
goes wrong with the works and the sales are completed,
further amounts will come into profits, besides the full
profits (if any) on what still remains to be sold. In a
sense, of course, none of it may be profit; it is merely
that the losses are not quite as large as had been ex-
pected, and some supposedly-lost capital is coming back.
Good progress has been made since the cleaning up :

The properties in possession last year brought in gross
£lO 9s. 9d. per cent, on their value as at Sept. 13, 1905 ;
the return would be higher on the basis of the book ,
value at the end of the 1906 financial year. This suggests
that further substantial “ profits ” from realisations may
be looked for. The advances (which have increased rapidly)
averaged about 84 per cent. One way and another, then,
the society appears to be on a very good wicket. What
it needs to do now is to keep its head. It is just at the
time when building societies can get rid of their old
assets at the best prices that they have most call to
watch their new advances.

Large additions have been made to plant durmg the last
few years ; vet much less is now written off for deprecia-
tion than formerly, and even then only a reduced divi-
dend of 6 per cent, is possible. How much less work and
pay the workpeople fret one can’t say, because the co. 8 P *
fished profit and loss account is a mere skeleton. Almost
every woollen manufacturing- co. in Australia and Maori-
land'is in the same condition. Wages Boards, Arbitration
Courts, &c., increased the cost of production ; but there
was no increased Protection against the for p] gn c01 “'
petitor who hadn't been struck by Wages Boards and
Arbitration Courts. Nevertheless, so long as wool was
low-priced the local manufacture could pay the wages
and usually make a fair profit. Latterly, however, the
rise in wool has crippled him. It hasn’t affected the
foreigner to the same extent; for one thing, he has an
inexhaustible supply of shoddy' to draw’ upon ; and if he
can’t counterbalance high wool prices by using more
shoddv, he gets square by cutting wages, which aren t
regulated as they are in Australia and Maoriland. bo for
want of Protection against the foreigner, and especially
against the foreigner’s shoddy goods, the whole business
of local wool manufacture is imperilled ; for when an
old mill with a name like the Kaiapoi’s is affected
as shown above, the state of the y’ounger and weaker
concerns can easily be sized up. Two or three Australian
mills have passed into the control of the banks, into
whose unwilling hands they drifted ; and evidently in
Maoriland the mortgagees fear that the same thing will
happen. Anyway, this co. has slackened off work and
put hands on short time, in order to use up stocks, and
so reduce the overdraft, etc. ; the total liabilities to the
public 12 months ago were £99,014, and they are now
down to £90,756. In the struggle to push business,
reduce stocks, and pay off debt, book debts have been
increased from £28,928 to £38,271; and that isn’t satis-
factory. Altogether the outlook for the co, is gloomy ;
and a gloomy outlook for an industrial co. isn't a pleasant
thing for either the labor or capital of a country,

latter only £7884), there is about £l5OO In other assets ;
so that, on the basis of the past six years’ results, the
present assets may just about pay off the debts, leaving
nothing for the shareholders, who put £48,000 into the

ally the mournful business of liquidation appears to be

Of the reserves £l4OO is depreciation account; but
w'hether that is a set-off against depreciation which is
known to have occurred, or whether it is a provision for
possible future depreciation, there are no means of
telling. Practically, all the assets are lumped into one
item, and absolutely all the income is lumped into
another ; and the assets may be rotten, and all the
income may come out of commissions, for all that the
accounts show'. If heavy w’riting-off is required, then
the excellent profits shown above are deceptive. Pos-
sibly, on the other hand, all book values are real values—
there is .10 telling from the figures. Presumably, the
shareholders are satisfied ; but there is a liability of
£12,897 on account of deposits, &c., and depositors are
surely entitled to something more explicit.

This society, now 15 years old, pays 5 per cent, dividend,
which is added to capital; and the Whole capital can be
withdrawn on giving notice. The bonus (called a divi-
dend—the other is called interest) is usually at the rate
of 5 per cent, on members’ purchases. The sales last term
amounted to £21,197, which is less than they ought to
be, seeing in how many directions the society has
branched out. Apart from trade debts (£4498), the
liabilities amount to £904 ; the assets include real estate
£2805, stock £8523, and book debts £3895, which last is
more than it ought to be in a co-operative concern. This
probably accounts for the fact that the bad debts amount,
as a rule, to about 3 per cent, per annum on capital. In
the table above, some of the figures in the last line are
necessarily approximate, the total amount of the bonus
being as yet uncertain.

The society, which is an amalgamation of small concerns,
began with preliminary expenses £214, against which
there were profit and loss balances of £54 taken over,
leaving a net deficit of £l6O. There was the usual rush
in the first term to pay bonus and dividend, which added
to the deficit. In the past half-year further amalgama-
tions took place, and another £B7 went in preliminary
expenses, while £lB of a building fund was taken over,
leaving a net addition of £69 to the deficit. The trading
loss for the term was £351, making, with the net addi-
tion to the deficit previously mentioned, a total de-
ficiency of £420 for the half-year. Possibly what has
been done is no criterion as to what can be done ; but it is
a pretty poor beginning, and the figures show that Perth
hasn’t yet caught on to the idea of co-operation in buying
its bread and tinned dog. The capital is now £1999.

The real reserves are probably more than this. Some
little time ago the co. put up new premises, and the cost
is now being vigorously written off. Twelve months ago
premises and property items stood at £12,163 ; they are
now down to £ll,OOO, ‘notwithstanding recent additions.
Apart from these premises, the principal assets are
advances and book-debts £22,039, and merchandise
stock, etc., £2877. Including overdraft (a Tasmanian
co. that pays a 25 per cent. div. must still have an
overdraft), this co.’s total debts are £14,900. The capital
is £8500; on that the aggregate profits of the past five
years amount to 209 per cent., an average of just upon
42 per cent, per annum. The Tasmanian wool-grower
must be an affluent person to be able to stand it—that is
to sav, if it’s not simply a case of passing the money from
one pocket to the other. The point for Tasmania to
ponder is whether he is affluent at the expense of the
country’s future.

Beat Bulletin, —As the directorate of the
A.M.P. Society has shown a disposition of late years to
take referendums of its policy-holders, I suppose they
are now considering the propriety of ascertaining the
views of the members in regard to the location of the
head office. For some years past the Vic. policies have
outnumbered those of N.S.W., and the directors, who
were so anxious to extend business to England and
S’Africa, and turn the society from a mutual concern
into a speculative institution, should lose no time in
finding out if a majority of the members do not wish to
see the business administered from Melbourne rather
than Sydney. A Melbourne Board, composed of persons
unknown to the Sydney members, with a trio of nominees
as local directors', would wake up the Sydney policy-
holder to the unsatisfactory position the Melbourne
policy-holder is in at the present time.— SdrreNDERER.

Boulder Deep . Levels, Kalgoorlie, has decided
to reconstruct with an assessment of 3s. per share, or
£42,000, in addition to which 20,000 shares will be held in
reserve. It is estimated that there are 44,650 tons of ore
in sight, worth 38s. per ton ; but, as no connections are
made between the different levels, the estimate is unre-
liable. Out of the new capital, it is proposed to put up
rises and sink winzes at a cost of £lO,OOO. If develop-
ment justifies it, a treatment plant will then be bought.
Meantime test crushings will be put through one of the
mills near by, as it is found that the ore varies so much
that mere assaying of drives gives misleading results,
There are three lodes in the property, but the Morrison
lode is the only one likely to give dividends. On the
adjoining Star even this lode is so patchy that it is got
payable.
rJ * « ♦ *
Perseverance, Kalgoorlie, has had two develop-
ments at the 1450 ft. level, the latest being in a crosscut
off the north drive, where the Perseverance lode is 17ft.
wide, worth 14dwt. Finds pretty nearly as good as this
have been announced at 1300 ft., but they have proved
very patchy. Below 700 ft. the mine has all along been
unsatisfactory, and, until something more definite is
known, it is dangerous to attach too much weight to the
recent finds. Management has a way of publishing
monthly costs with many of the costs left out; hence
the apparent big profits. Nothing but stoping and mill-
ing are included, and these total 16s. sd. If the real
costs were given the figure would be about 275. and the
real profit about £9OOO.
» * * *
Chaffers, Kalgoorlie, will shortly be crosscutting
from the 1700 ft. level of the Boulder Main Beef for the
4ft. lode, worth 35dwt., supposed to have been located by
diamond drill in May, 1904. About two years ago, a
similar crosscut was put in at 1400 ft., but, though it went
right across the lease, nothing payable was found, and
the same thing may happen again. Co. has a credit
balance of £36,700, so has plenty of money to experiment
with. The proposition seems a very doubtful one.
* * * *
Great Fingall, Day Dawn (W.A.), still looks
poor in the bottom, or thirteenth, level. In the north
drive the pay shoot begins only about 540 ft. from the shaft,
and even then it only runs from 20s. to 355. per ton. The
reef splits at 600 ft. north, as in all the other levels, and
the branches are rather poor and irregular. Whenever
the present reserves, amounting to two-and-a-half-years’
supply, are worked out, the mine will be in a precarious
way, as the greater part of the thirteenth level is under
the pay shoot, which gives out. Next year co. will only
pay 2s. 6d. divs. quarterly. That is all it will earn on 325.
per ton, which is the grade of ore to be treated.

At the half-yearly meeting of Golden Pole,
Davy hurst (W.A.), bears, backed by the press, were
accused of doing irreparable damage by cabling false
reports to Adelaide. Nonsense ! The management
invariably published far too optimistic reports, and
naturally this was exposed. For instance, the past three
months’ return averaged 545. 9d. per ton, including 45.,
proportion from old tailings. This left the extractable
bullion at 50s. 9d. ; yet it had been officially estimatedat
765. 6d. At the meeting this was reduced to 635. 9d. ;
but recent results show even this to be exaggerated.
Capital of co. is to be consolidated into 20,000 shares of
£1 each in order to defeat the bears. Five head of stamps
have been closed down temporarily, or permanently.
After six months the worst may happen.
* * * *
Sons of Gwalia, Leonora (W.A.), has struck
a new make of stone 10ft. wide, worth 80s., in a crosscut
at No. 7 level. MacDermott, the new manager is very
satisfied with the prospects of the mine. If he is right
there will be a big rise in scrip. The mine is in a mess,
not much filling up having been done for a long time, and
mullock passes being deficient. MacDermott was
“borrowed ” from the Ivanhoe to straighten things up,
and should be the very man for the job.
* * * *
Mararoa, Norseman (W.A.), now under six
months option to the Princess Boyal Central for £lOOO,
looks like proving one of the best mines in the district.
The main shaft is down 250 ft., and the third level is to be
opened up at 240 ft. At 150 ft. 400 ft. has been driven on a
reef Bft. wide, worth 60s. per ton. Most of the plant is in
position, and everything will be in full swing shortly.

Queensland Menzies (W.A.) has made a mess of

An awkward situation has arisen at Broken
Hill. The workmen wanted a rise, and the cos. frankly
recognised that it was a fair thing, considering the price
of metals. A conference was suggested. Only a minority
of the workmen are in the unions, and the owners
wanted a mixed conference—unionists and non-unionists.
At once sprang up the old trouble about “ the recogni-
tion of the unions” —which, in this case, meant the
non-recognition of the non-unionists. The unions
wouldn’t agree to sit with the others, and the con-
ference was off. Then the cos. came along with a
12J per cent, rise so long as lead stood at over
£l6 per ton. But the unions wouldn’t accept it. Not
that it isn’t as much as they expected. In fact, in con-
ference they might have accepted 10 per cent. What
they are going to do with it when the money is offered
them isn’t clear ; the spectacle of 3000 or 4000 men hand-
ing back the extra Bs. or 10s. a week, and telling William
Knox and Harvey Patterson that they couldn’t think of
robbing them of it, will be unique. But perhaps they
won’t. It is a good deal more likely that they will put
the Bs. or 10s. in their pockets, and go on with an appeal
to Arbitration. As the mines are in N.S. Wales and the
smelting works in S. Australia, possibly the Common-
wealth Court could be appealed to. It was to meet such
a case that J. H. Howe, at the Federal Convention, got
an amendment made in the draft Constitution to provide
for a Commonwealth Court. Howe, besides being a
Broken Hill mine director, was the M.P. for Port Pirie,
where the smelters are. The proposed sliding scale is cer-
tainly a poor thing ; it slides, in fact, with a single jerk.
A rise of 5 per cent, with lead over £l4 10s., 10 per cent,
over £l6, and 15 per cent, over £l7 10s. would be fairer.
The share market is uneasy over the trouble ; but really,
so far, there is no reason to look for any stoppage of work.

Management of the North, Broken Hill, is
turning its searchlight on the old abandoned 500 ft. level,
which is under suspicion of harboring a good-sized lode.
This level was never systematically explored in the old
days, and recent developments at the British boundary
have prompted the Junction North people to remedy the
omission without delay. Hitherto the North has not
gone out west in search of plums, but if the lode indica-

Mons to be seen in the old quarry on the western side of
the workings are at all reliable, the North should have a
valuable second string to its bow. And with a ricketty
market like that for lead and silver to rely upon, a
second string is a large consideration.
It must be a terrible trial to be quite sure you
have a lode and yet not be able to find it. That is
how the British, Broken Hill, is situated with
regard to the sulphides on the 800 ft. level.
The diamond drill has distinctly prevaricated about this
body, which was followed by a bore for 80ft. or 90ft.
below the 600 ft. level, and left going down strongly. But
when the management started to look for it at the 800 ft.,
the ore seemed to have turned a corner somewhere and
disappeared. And that’s why the British market is
weaker.

The Broken Hill Junction North shaft has had
its bones set, and is almost ready again. Now the filling
of the caverns made by creep and flood has to be done.
When that is completed, the renewed shaft will be solid
once more. If the neighboring Junction finds a lot of
ore, and decides to leave hundreds of tons of it on the
“ back” of the big slope below the 675 ft. level, so that
the creep won’t extend any lower, the Junction North
shaft may be assured for all time,” as the directors
put it. If not—time will tell.

being worked in Marsh shaft by the British, Broken Hill,
after it leaves British territory? As far as it can be
traced, the lode is cutting' diagonally across the northern
corner of the British block 16 lease, from the
Junction to the North. The British has the body from
above the 300 ft. to the 600 ft., where the underlay now
appears to be changing to the east, at the same time
taking a turn to the eastward, thus either making for a
clean cut off or else pitching into the North mine.

Before it has even decided on a process, let
alone provided a plant to work it, the Zinc Corporation
sees financial trouble ahead, and tries to dodge it by an
increase of capital. Of course the Robinson-Baillieu-
Govett syndicate has underwritten the issue ; it couldn’t
afford to do anything else.

B. 20/9/’O6 gives cost of handling
Broken Hill ores. Returning charge at Cockle Creek is
.£3 15s. ; freight to Newcastle, 3s. 6d.; and other
charges, ss. lid.—total, £5 4s. sd. Freight charges are
within about 4s. of cost of shipping ore to the other side
of the globe, a;‘art from any rebate. That is a good enough
reason why the foreigner gets 270,000 tons of Australian
ore to smelt per year. The foreigner can handle lead
ore for 6s. lid. less than Cockle Creek can do the work
for. The freight on ore, matte, coal, fluxes, etc., on
German railways is cut down to a very low figure.
American railways and steamers have to carry iron ore
worth only about 15s. per ton over a much greater dis-
tance than from Broken Hill to Newcastle. Smelters’
returning charges and general costs of handling ore are
exceedingly low in U.S.A. ; consequently lead and zinc
ores find a much better market. The difference is most
pronounced on zinc ores, because spelter is quoted at the
same price there as in Europe. German smelters used to
do a trade with American ore; the States have beaten
them, and that is what Australia has got to do. The
business requires a subsidy, mainly because German trade
is heavily subsidised by shipping rebates and low railway
rates. It is of no use to tackle a business like the metal
trade in a tin-pot and inadequate way ; a big temporary
sacrifice has to be made. A duty of 20 per cent, on pig
iron is of little use if freight charges more than counter-
balance it; and if lue pig iron had to be taken far in
Australia, that would be the case. The development of
metallurgy is the most important question in Australia.
One-eighth of the population depends on mining. Aus-
tralia should push the business for all it is worth, helping
it with every kind of assistance in its power.
■* * If A
Shuttleton Mines (N.S.W.), whose shares
have been neglected lately, gets a slight move on, and
not altogether because of the price of copper. Shutlleton
has 14ft. of ore, worth 8 per cent., without dressing, at
the lowest level ; and as rock drills and air compressors
are being installed, it is only necessary for the directors
to get to work on solid business lines with the neighbor-
lng Growl Creek, and accept a reasonable price for the
ores. Growl Creek smelters are practically idle, and
profit to both mines can come out of a well piloted ore-
deal. To miss the present market is like throwing away
the winning' ticket in a Tatt’s sweep.

Premier, Cobar (N.S.W.), adjoining The Peak
(the latter was one of the mines in J. Bull’s big
deal with the Longworth-Reid Great Cobar Syndicate),
looks promising'. The lode struck in the shaft, and now
being driven on, has every, appearance of being the
“blue” lode; it is highly mineralised, directly on the
line of the “blue” lode, and carries copper, gold and
silver right across the drive. Values are, however small;
but, as the “ blue ” lode in the Peak is patchy, the thing
may improve. At Is. The Bulletin referred to contrib.
shares as worth looking into ; and they are a good deal
more than that now.

Sulphur is the pervading smell round the
Catherine Reef United, Bendigo ; 241 tons for 91oz. is a
paltry output from a mine about which so much that is
favorable has been written. Spec sellers in the golden
city have raked in additional shekels from the fall in
shares, and the 80s. shareholders are intent on improving
things. What is said in palliation is that the last lot of
stone came from the western limits of the formation,
which is low grade. Was not the mine opened up suffi-
ciently to prevent this, or is it that the relieving of
Coakes of heavy underground work threw things out of
gear? Co. has a big formation, and it needs to
do its mining on a big scale. Directors were
slow in shaft-sinking, and they seem slower still about
pushing ahead the levels and opening up connections. If
the formation runs up to 60ft. in width there ought to be
a , bigger output than 400 tons per week. Read in the
light of stone in sight, proved by drives and rises, it can-
not be said that the market value of shares is in sight
even at present reduced figures. There is nothing, then,
to justify any rise until the shaft-sinking and driving,
both at the present levels and 100 ft. deeper, show more
ore and gold.
* * * «
Deep quartz-mining at Bendigo is now at the
critical stage, New Chum Railway and Victoria Quartz
being about to prove the worth of the formations struck
hy them below 4Gooft. The N.C. Railway has 400 ft. to
crosscut to centre country ; and the men who work at
4282 ft. below the surface in the dead end of a crosscut
deserve more pay' than they are likely to get. Victoria
Quartz at 4154 ft. has tapped the quartz in the centre-
country winze. Now the exploration of the saddle
will be begun in real earnest. It was when gold
was found in these mines below 4000 ft. that geo-
logist Dunn coined the phrase, “ Illimitable Bendigo.”
But things have to be proved yet. The general belief,
geologically, is that gold decreases in reefs with depth.
Will Bendigo differ from the rest of the world in this as
it did in the matter of saddle formations? Good gold at
over 4000 ft. at Bendigo would lead to an inrush of capital
for mines on all the lines that are waiting for pluck
combined with money to enable them to face further
sinking.

“Bendigo City” is the newest float of the
“ illimitable ” field. Said float offends the canons, as
drawn up by local old-fashioned brokers, and is a hair-
raiser to even the newer school. The prospectus, with
its head-lines, reads like an evening paper murder. Even
the misty past of tradition is racked, to tell of the bucket-
ful of quartz that gave half a bucketful of gold. Had this
gold come from the outcrop on the claim, there would
have been no need to write—“ It is very remarkable
that, surrounded as it is, this line of reef was
never prospected.” Vendors take 12,000 shares at
Is. 6d., also a little cash solatium of £5OO. Then
there is £lOOO to go to the credit of the co., less
brokerage. There is reason, of course, for trying any
outcrop in Bendigo, even one at the back-door of the
hospital. Yet this experiment would have been more
appreciated locally had more cash gone to the credit of
working account and less to the “ peggers.”
* * * *
Bull’s deep-lead mines at Moorlort (Vic.) still
fail to show up brightly. Victorian Deep Leads has got
over the trouble with the Charlotte Plains folk, and the
electrical three-throw pump is now at work. The
whisper current in Maldon that heavy ground had been
met, has some confirmation, as there was a trickle of
sand in a drive off the main north branch drive.
Luck would be at its worst if the Loddon Valley’s
experience of want of depth in the main under
level was repeated at the V.D.L. This hardly
seems likely’', though, as in the main west cross-
cut there is plenty of room overhead to the gutter.
If it be true that the Loddon Valley is into wash,
this will be No. 3 Bull mine to reaoh the lead.
Charlotte Plains showed the way, and the New Havilah
came next. Rich bores are being mentioned by the
London papers. Possibly this means bringing more
money to get the mines under weigh. To get into deep
leads it is necessary to have big pumps and big pumping ;
to work profitably is to have big blocking in properly-
drained ground. Charlotte Plains does not report yields
up to the “ dwt. to the shovel-full ” prospects ; but they
may not have reached the El Dorado yet.

Black Horse, Egerton (Vic.), is not to be the
winner to Bewick, Moreing, and Co. that it was to Bailey
and his confreres in the old days. The firm has turned
down the option it had. So the copper formation lan-
guishes, and the pumps have to be kept going, but not at
J. Bull’s expense.

On splashes of carbonates and specks of glance,
heavy crossheads have beeh given in Melbourne papers to
a copper show at Mt. Camel, near Heathcote (Vic). The
show was reported on some little time back by geologist
Dunn, who thought well of it as a surface show. Result,
pegging from Caniel to Beersheba. Now comes the
gentle newspaper puff in nice, big, black letters. As a
corrective, let it be printed that some of the clever mining
people in Melbourne, on Dunn’s report, picked out men
to have a look at Mt. Camel. There was even more
unanimity about the so-called merits of the
field among these experts than there was among
the three who summed up the worth of Coppabella.
Experts, of course, make mistakes, for they cannot see
farther beyond the pick than other folk; but their
unanimity is sufficient to cause the public to look on
until the formation is opened up by some other Johnny,
and it is shown that there is sufficient copper ore out of
which to make a decent-sized pot.

, Of the once highly profitable Chalk’s group,
.Chalk’s No. 3, Maryborough (Vic.), is the lowest claim
down the Majorca lead. Deeper ground u nd heavy
water long told the usual tale. Hence, expenditure to
date has been £2ll,ooo—calls £78,300 and gold £120,000
—and divs. have been nil. Co. for a while loafed
on the Charlotte Plains, while the latter was pump-
ing ; but Drysdale Brow'n stirred up the Mines Depart-
ment so hotly that pumping had to be resumed. Co.
has two shafts, but its future depends on No. 2, low'er
down the lead, where the big beam engine thumps aw’ay
lifting water month in and month out. Divs. are almost
within sight, as the wash is opening- up so well as to give
profits. But a Government loan of £5OOO blocks the way.
This money was lent when the co. was in extremity, at
interest far below bank rate. Despite these favors, co.
does not want to wipe off its little debt before starting
dividends. The idea, as mentioned last W’eek, is to alter-
nate dividends and progress payments on account. Bent,
having his pocket full, says a lordly “Yes.” Thus is
established a precedent of the worst kind. Is the same
thing to be done at the South Star, the Prentice and
Southern, and the heaps of other mines that have had
grants? A lot of capital and gold has gone without
return ; but are the people who are now to be favored
the men who put up the cash? Ev< n if they are, the
public ought to know if the mine has sufficient profits in
sight to do the two things—pay its State debt and keep
dividends going. If it has not, what a chance for a
market “ go ” 1

In spite of the high price of copper and the
fact that it is a good little mine, O.K. (N.Q.) will either
have to temporarily drop its dividend altogether, or
reduce it to 3d. The struggle to pay 6d. per month has
been game, but on the far too great number of shares it
is more than the mine can fairly stand. Sixpence means
£47 per ton on an output of 180 tons a month ; and even
the O.K. can’t do that and pay for extrasgpa The co.
has always provided machinery out of profits, and lately
there has been an extra call for plant, &c., and the call is
likely to last some time. For a while the management at
the mine was about as bad as it could be. Now new mana-
ger Shepherd is having a clean up. -With the present smelt-
ing plant, anything like reasonably economical work is
impossible; and the whole thing needs remodelling.
Larger blowers, more boiler power, and a new stack
must be provided ; and these, structural alterations,
a compressor, drills, new winding plant (now in hand),
and other works -will cut deep into the revenue. The
stock is too riiuch of a gambling-counter already, and, if
the div. were knocked off altogether, it would make it
more so. The mine Can pay 3d. and still provide for the
new works, and it will be better to do that than either
run into debt or pay the bigger dividend spasmodically.

The Murchison River is one of the Mt. Farrell
(Tas.) silver-lead shows that refuse to come up to repre-
sentations. Some time ago it was announced that 7000
tons of ore at grass would net £t per ton when a concen-
trating mill was provided. The mill (which cost more
than double the estimate) has been provided, and while
it ran last half-year treated 5360 tons, of which 4*60 tons
came front the dump. Mine, mill and other expenses ran
to £3404, and sales and advances on products only
panned out at £lO3O. There are some extraordinary
items. in the accounts. Advances made to the co.
during the half-year, (on security of property, appa-
rently) were £2146; this was used mainly to, pay
off an old advance. Yet there are these items paid
out: —“ Underwriting loan to co., £2O ” ; “ guaranteeing
loans to co., £250.” Talk about buying money! Who
got this £270 for guaranteeing £2ooo* odd ? No estimate
is yet possible of the ore reserves, the manager says, but
he hopes to make one at the end of this current half year.
Remembering what has happened to other estimates in
connection with this co., it is to be hoped, when the
manager makes one of the ore reserves, he will be very
explicit as to how he arrives at his figures. That will be
a lot more valuable than the usual wheeze tagged to the
recent report:—“ In conclusion, I have much pleasure in
stating that I consider the future prospects particularly
bright, and I have every confidence in its becoming a
payable mine in the near future.”

Dalziell’s (N. Q.) have had a market flutter on the
strength of ore found in the winze sunk from the 50ft.
level. This winze is-down between 20ft. and 30ft., and
the underlie is erratic and irregular. A tunnel was
driven 300 ft. to intersect the lode, but failed to find
anything; it is quite probable, however, that tin
will be found, as the bottom of the winze, with tin
showing in it, is less than 60ft. above the tunnel.
Tin ore’ shoots are often short ' and erratic, and
such propositions should therefore be moderately capi-
talised. Walsh and Tinaroo district has a vast number of
payable tin shows, and some preposterously over-capi-
talised concerns ; it has nine mills, and the whole lot pro-
duce about £22,000 worth of tin ore per month. That
would be a fair thing for one big mine, with, sav, 200,000
shares. Yet shares in the Stannary Hills, Vulcan, and
half-a-dozen other mines, aggregate over 1,000,000 ; there
is also a long list of as yet unfloated claims. The profit
on a production of £22,000 worth of tin ore per month will
not stand such a big swag of shares, and there is not
eriough battery power or water to grind out the tin for
them.
Cloncurry copper shows are said tc
have good gold values, up to sdwt. and Bdwt. per ton o:
ore. But the boomster (or his victim) should recoiled
that high copper values minimise the value of a few dwt.
of gold in the ore. Thus sdwt. of gold with 20 percent,
copper would result in the furnace concentration of £5
worth of gold per ton of copper ; and, as a set off, freight
to refining works and the cost of electrolytic treatment
has to be charged for. The best place for electrolytic
works is near water power or a coal mine, and Cloncurry
is a long way from either. Some of the Mt. Elliott ore
may have as high gold value as Mt. Morgan ; but it is one
thing for the latter to send blister copper to New Jersey,
U.S.A., for an extraction of £5O worth of gold per
ton of copper, and quite another thing to make a
profit on the electrolytic extraction of £5. worth of gold.
Electrolytic refining is now done cheaply, because fine
copper commands top prices, and because it can be done
on a large scale near to coal mines. The copper is ex-
ported in any case, so the line of least resistance is to
send the blister copper or matte (both containing the
gold) to a foreign market in a foreign ship. That is the
line of least resistance, because Australia is in Freetrade
hobbles, and has a crop of home-made difficulties in the
way of freight charges to local smelting and refining
works.

Stannary Hills (N.Q.) advertises that it intends
to call for some big tenders for tunnelling and sinking.
The Stannary Hills hasn’t so much money to burn that it
can afford to advertise its intentions. But it has been
travelling on its mere intentions all its life.
Reported by cable that the money for the
Burketown-Lilydale line, in the Gulf country (Q.), is
nearlj'in sight. It seems so unnecessary to make'that
sort of announcement; why not wait a’day or two to
actually report the money put up? When it gets the
money to build the line, the crowd will presumably do
what it hasn’t done so far—probe the mines a bit to see
if they are worth building a line to.
Croydon (N.Q.) is in a bad way, and there is
nothing to lead one to expect an early change. Mine-
owners, while professing to have the same old faith in
the field, won’t go down ; and the gold won’t come up.
One after another, therefore, men who looked like
fixtures, are moving south. Cloncurry has taken a pack
of them lately. *

Shareholders in New Craven’s Caledonia,
Charters Towers, are either a dull or a hopeful crowd.
Nothing near the claim is turning out any stone, nor is
Craven’s doing anything to locate the reef for itself.
Victoria and Caledonia is, however, sinking a straight
shaft, and, should it discover the good thing that is sup-
posed to be there, Craven’s will dip down a bit deeper.
The co. commenced the term with £77 and winds up
with £1195. Increase is not from profits, for the mine
does not produce any stone. Six months’ expenditure
ran to £563 (office expenses swallowed £l6B, while
mining “ and general ” took £385). Office or “ general ”
expenses included chloroform administered to share-
holders in order to extract £1666 in calls, without a tap
of real work being done in return.

The Papuan Brilliant and Victoria, a one-time
big dog at Charters Towers, made a profit of £1428 in six
months from 1188 tons of stone. On such a small output,
a profit of £1 4s. out of £3 15s. a ton shows careful
management. Development totalled 267 ft. for the six
months, and included sinking the underlie shaft 60ft.
Prospects of a revival in the Pap. are none too bright, as
the underlie will reach the boundary in another 90ft. or
so. There are patches of stone showing from 6in. to 18in.
in the shaft; but what seems to attract the co.’s atten-
tion is a small vein up in the hanging wall. The Papuan
is desperate when it grasps at a streak of color between
two walls. The present credit stands at £2802, with 150
tons in the paddock.

South Glanmire and Monkland, Gympie (Q.),
has a much improved outlook as the result of prospect-
ing. This work has been done on a bed of slate, 16ft. to
25ft. thick, some 200 ft. below the main Monkland slates.
This lower bed varies in its physical and chemical com-
position, hence the poorness or richness of the reefs in-
tersecting the bed. Black floors mean good geld, while
grey floors are disappointing. The last crushing of 1344
tons for 9240 z., was chiefly from this lower bed, and gave
a div. of 3d. No. 2 South Great Eastern, an adjoining
property, has just started to prospect in a similar direc-
tion, and has already cut 6ft. of a formation, which
should intersect this lower bed in depth. This lower bed
of slate is bound to have an important effect on these
two properties, they being situated in favourable posi-
tions, as their past record shows.

John Moffatt, chairman of Mt. Molloy (Q.),
explained at the half-yearly meeting why the directors
hold on to a lot of money. Up to the present the ore has
been more or less picked, and zinc sulphide and silieious
material have been left. Concentration is required to get
rid of some of the silica and zinc. If concentration is to
pay, it won’t be by losing half the copper in the tailings,
as was done at Girilambone and Cobar Chesney (N.S.YV.).
Also Molloy will have to mine low-grade ore a lot cheaper
than it seems able to do at present. Nevertheless, the
thing must be tried. Molloy has a splendid water supply
near the smelting works ; , nd, if the mine is to last,
concentration is essential, in order to reduce the cost of
fluxes and coke. The mine is timbered on the square set
system, and mining costs are high ; and on top of that
are heavy costs of carrying ironstone and coke. To pre-
pare for the new era the shaft is to be sunk and new levels
opened. Meantime a sixpenny div. has arrived earlier
than was expected.
“ M. 0.” : “ Quidam ” (B. 13/7/’OG) suggests the
smelting of aluminium with electric furnaces at the Barron
Falls (N.Q.). N.S.YV. has valuable deposits of the most
tractable aluminium ores (bauxite, on the Shoalhaven
River). Donald Clark pointed out the value of the
material for fire bricks, but N.S.W. prefers to import the
bricks from the other side of the earth. Aluminium is
smelted at Pittsburg (U.S.A.), and supplies are reckoned
to have run short—which, considering that they have
only,lately started to tackle the ore deposits, seems a bit
of bluff. The best ores are not common, but as yet they
have not been assiduously looked for in Australia.

Horseshoe Creek arid MountToddtinfield(N.T.),
in spite of adverse reports by people who have p id a six-
hour visit to this immense area, is proving itself under
awful difficulties. In a little over 12 months, a 5-stamp
battery has turned out tin concentrates to the value of
£10,500. This was picked ore ; naturally, because the
co. charges £2 10s. for crushing, so miners will not look
at 4 per cent, stuff. The place has proved itself by
sheer force of its richness and the perseverance of the
prospectors and owners of the mill (Cleland, Webb
Elliot and McCarthy). The S. A. Government is apathetic)
and will not construct a mill to help prospectors, and the
heathen Chinee is waxing fat by crushing the rich leaders
and bagging the “nobby bits.” Truly they are a slow
people in the Territory to allow such country to be
thus over-run. During the last six months John has
erected two substantial stores (a thing he will not
do unless he sees certain money in it) ; he carts the
ore to battery and stores from Pine Creek; he has
all the best claims on tribute; and the white man
who lends the heathen his name for claim-holding pur-
poses, gets 10 per cent, of the tin won. During August
one tribute yielded 14 tons of concentrates from 70 tons
of material; the concentrates went 61 per cent, metallic
tin. These Chows are off to China. Boylin’s, the best
show at Horseshoe Creek, is down 80ft., on a 3ft. 3in. lode.
A recent crushing went 4J tons concentrates from 20 tons
stone. At Mount Todd two Chows had a tribute on the
Clean Sweep, and in' three weeks got 16Jcwt. of 32 per
cent, stuff from tons ore.' They have now thrown the
show up, and started a gambling den. Europeans w r ho
have good claims are hanging back in hopes of getting a
State plant; meanwhile, John is steadily but surely
getting the upper hand. Three disgusted miners sold out
to one Que Noz for £l5O. That naturalised Celestial has
gone down 60ft. on a splendid lode (porphyry and quartz),
and has 100 tons stuff paddoc.ked, which will return
a handsome profit. The Northern Territory for the
Asiatics!
An early wet season is setting in in the Northern
Territory, and the Chinese are flocking to the latest tin-
field, Horseshoe Creek, in droves. Every day brings
fresh arrival , but white men are conspicuous by not
arriving. A naturalised Chow' has half the field, andsun-
naturalised Chow will soon have the other half. A splen-
did field is thus being given away to Asiatics ; grass
humpies are being built with dispatch ; and the place
will soon become the usual Chow hovel, out of which
Australia will get nothing hut disease.
! ~ Tilr , e ®,^ ur recent small floats have given the
Mann ah ill field, m the droughty north-east of S. Aus.
' an other possible chance. There is gold, also copper
over some thousands of square miles of this country’:
Teetulpa, the State's best alluvial rush for SO years
past, was there. The ore bodies are, however, most
irregular; when you are getting along nicely a hard
bar arrives, and the ore is at an end for the
time. At shallow depths the free gold also fades out.
JJunns Homeward Bound Co., with its office in Mel-
bourne, is tackling a show that gave 3960 z. from 71 tons
which is good enough to go on with. But hopes need
not be built to match that return. Possibly none of the
scores who have pottered about on these'claims have
been persistent enough ; certainly not one of the claims
has been anything but a failure.

The strength, lightness, durability and low cost
of spiral rivited pipe have given it a place of superiority
above any other pipe. This pipe possesses enormous
bursting strength, and is protected, inside and out, with a
perfect coating manufactured from asphalt. Asphalt
coaled steel pipes have lasted from 25 to 40 years without
any sign of decay, and may last as long again. Spiral
pipe is manufactured by Mephan Ferguson, at Wanganui,
New Zealand, and at 'his engineering and' pipe works,
Melbourne, where the latest up-to-date machinery is also
used for making boilers, fluming, refrigerators, bolts, nuts,
and every discriution of cast or wrought iron work.*

The Rea veil Air Compressor is an entirely new
departure in compressor design, and by its numerous
good points is already finding considerable favor in Au -
tralian mining circles. As there are no suction valves,
the volumetric efficiency is at least 5 per cent higher than
any other compressor. It is unrivalled for driving bv
means of an electric.motor, and .is the .only machine in
which driving gears can be altogether dispensed with.
The sole licensees for Australia are Babcock and Wilcox,

Another old Australian gone. The big
willow tree which, for half a century or so, sen-
tinelled the spot where payable gold was first
officially struck in Australia, at the foot of Bluff
Hill, Ophir (N.S.W.), got its quietus the other
day, and laid its bones in the erstwhile golden
stream. The tree stood in loose wash-dirt on the
bank of Lewis Pond Creek. A new-chum fossicker
cut a race close to its roots, and a heavy flood did
the rest.

“ Dandalup ” : I remember some time ago
in The Bulletin several pars, on aboriginal in-
sensibility to pain. I would like to enter a Wes-
tralian lady named Energy as a heavy-weight
insensible in this class. My nomination was
loved by two brothers, Bung and Billy. She
turned her shiny black back on Bung and
bestowed her charms on his flea-bedecked brother.
The enraged Bung followed the lovers. He came
across Energy lying up against a log asleep, and,
taking three spears, he drove them into her
faithless and velvety side. She never moved
—just slept on until Billy came home. Billy,
seeing the spears sticking out of his bride,
realised that something had happened, and
kicked the lady to draw her attention,
just as a white gentleman—a Governor or Premier
—might whistle to his wife when he wanted to
catch her eye. The kick awoke Energy, and when
she sat up she was much surprised about the
spears, and said so. Then she pulled them out
and broke them up. This lady, who went right
on slumbering with three spears in her, was called,
as I already mentioned, Energy. If she had been
Weary or Sleepy she might have put up a still
better record. Still, there is no knowing what
kind of record she would have put up if she hadn’t
been kicked.
“ Brad ” : Some bush wanderers and
drifters are getting very much excited lately on
account of nesting magpies attacking foot-
travellers and others. My opinion of Mr. Mag is
that he is the skite of the feathered tribe, and
should be treated as such. The less notice one
takes of him the better. The reason he attacks
passers-by at nesting time is that he is anxious to
let you know that he is a father, and has a full
cradle at home. He wishes to advertise himself,
and puts on no end of “ydog.” He firmly believes
that he invented matrimony, and bites your ear
to draw attention to his patent, just as a man
once fired a gun at a French President to adver-
tise his new method of stuffing mattresses. Treat
him with disdain and show you don’t care a worm
whether he is a father or not, and he will stay at
home and rock the cradle in the mornings. There
is nothing humbler on earth than the magpie who
has been regarded as a fly or a grasshopper.

Maoriland papers have for some time past
been giving in great detail the results of egg-
laying competitions, which are a long-drawn-out
gamble. Careful study of weekly results leads
writer to the belief that some of these fowls lay
stiff, and their owners should be hauled before the
stewards for flagrant inconsistency. These fowl
contests have suggested to a bucolic M.H.R. that
it would be a splendid idea to hold cow competi-
tions, and he is asking the Government in appeal-
ing accents to subsidise them. The rich farmer,
who owns most of the country, is seemingly too
poor to erect a few byres, and pay a few pounds
to_ a supervisor fora twopenny competition like
this. Leaning up against the Government is one
of the farmer’s principal and most payable indus-
tries. The Government, in fact, is the best
milking cow in his herd.

‘ ‘ Prooshan ” : He this dog-poison anti-
dote business. My neighbor Bell’s dog Rover lay
kicking at my gate, and I started prizing his jaws
open and casting salt into his throat. Up came
Hodgson, the butcher. “Hello,
is that Bell’s dog ? Dam thief,
too; shook a pig’s head outer my
shop yesterday. Pity to see him
croak, though; Bell’s kids are
terrible fond of him. Get me a
pair of bellows, some charcoal,
and a hammer.” After pounding
the charcoal, he filled the bellows
half-full, jammed the snout half-
way down the dog's throat, and
let fly. “Woof!” Rover gave
a buck, an then “M’yop, m’yop,
m’yop! ” Up came Simpson.
“Got any salad hile ? ” Then a
whole bottle of the “h’b*” went in
to swell the budget, Hut still no
bait. Boston, the , herdsman, ar-
rived, and swung Rover around
by the tail till they both went
down together. Then Hodgson
said, “Muster got worter, or
he’d a throwedthe bait long ergo.”
Boston reckoned there was acid
put with the strychnine. “The
acid makes it esservest in his
guts, y’ know. No savin’ of ’em
then.” “Dowse him in the
crick,” said a new arrival. Off
we went, dragging Rover to
Flynn’s race. On the way some-
one remembered that we should
have cut a bit of the dog’s tail
off. It was done. In swinging
Rover, preparatory to immersing
him in the race, Hodgson fell with
the dog and tripped me, and both
of us accompanied Rover into the
water. Just here Rover died, and Bell appeared
on the scene. “ What er yer doin’ with that
dog ? Didn’t I poison the wretcJti myself for bitin’
the missus! ”

“ Philo ” : Don’t see anything remarkable
in the endurance case quoted by “R.” (18/10/’O6),
when the lost man could dine regularly on
nutritive moss while reclining comfortably in the
friendly shelter of a hollow tree. A case of real
endurance and remarkable stamina was that of a
young woman named Constance Jeneczek, some
years ago. She was rescued after rushing about
the bush, without food or water, in a broiling
sun, for six days. It is calculated that she
covered over 150 miles in that time. Another is
that of a little 15-year-old girl, lost near Charters
Towers (Q.). She was found, still going strong,
after wandering about for five days without food
or water. ,

“ Gip ” : Ran a rabbit into a very large
log. Hacked and burnt the log, and found, about
the middle, three fox cubs. ’Possum grey they
were, with black-tipped paws; no suggestion of
fawn or red about them. Scattered about them
were remains of nearly everything that flies or
runs. Heads, wings, legs, &c., of plover, wood-
duck, bronzewing, magpies, domestic fowls and
turkeys. Also amongst the furry things were re-
mains of ’possum, rock-wallaby, hare and rabbit.
Marvellous how immaculately clean the cubs were,
considering the litter. Already cunning was
marked in their small, pointed faces, but they
were such frightened and bonnie little fellows,
and their eyes so clear and surprised, that even the
horrid man who despatched them did it sorrow-
fully.

A TESTIMONIAL.
WAYFARER (to late guest of the Murumberee Hotel): “ Wot’s the beer like up yonder, mate !”
THE LATE GUEST : “W ot’s it like! Why, look at me, an’ I’ve on’y had lemonade.”
“Jim”: In reply to “Cocky’s” howl
(B. 27/9/’O6) regarding us casual workers and
walkers, I would like to say that I never read
anything in print bad enough to describe the
cocky as one finds him on his own dunghill. He
hasn’t got enough humanity in his composition to
make him treat his own children as human beings;
so on that basis I don’t suppose Bill and Jim can
expect a fair deal of him. And, in regard to him
paying ss. a day for men, he must mean in harvest
time, when one certainly will get that pay for a
day and a-half, which the cocky calls a day. How
would he snort if asked to pay three dollars and
a-half a day for harvesters, as the cocky in
America had to pay this harvest, and the IJ.S.
cocky doesn’t get seed wheat from the State in a
bad time like our cocky—for which seed wheat he
is too dishonest, to pay in a great many cases.
And “Cocky” is a saver of the truth when he
says the real bush worker doesn’t carry Matilda,
but takes her around in a motor-car. Let me tell
him straight that that is just how you will find
the true grafter—marching. The men who
travel on bicycles and brumbies are mostly too
flash to take on rough or hard work. No, Mr.
Cocky, the only fault any unprejudiced person
can find with us is that we work too hard and too
cheap. Although I am expecting better wages
this coming harvest, yet I know I’ll not get any-
thing near as much as the work is worth. And,
as “ Cocky ” mentions one Act that he says ought
to be passed, I’ll chip in with a couple more—an
Act regulating hours and wages of workers at all
primary industries, and an Employees’ Accommo-
dation Act, as the places the cocky expects one to
sleep in are often foul enough to give a pig Anti-
coekyitis.
■* # * *
“ Balf,” in reply to “ Cocky ” (B.
27/9/’O6): —
I have had much experience of cookies in N.S.W., S.A.,
andTas. Met real men amongst them, also met lots who
were no good. Never heard of 7s. to Bs. a day except
during good seasons, when labor was scarce. As for
swaggies being 95 per cent, useless for toil, navvies are
mostly swagmen, and I could find hundreds of others to
work “ Oocky ” blind. And about real bushmen not “loaf-
ing on the track ” with “ Matilda.,” He’s right. Hump-
ing bluey looking for toil isn’t loafing—it’s worse than
work. Also, about “ riding a horse, looking for work.”
In a farming district you get no cheap grass, and you have
to pay town prices for chaff, despite the fact that if the
cocky sold it in the town a great part of the price would
go in delivering and selling. Result: Working for horse-
feed. As for piecework, you may make decent wages at
first job of it, but you may depend on working
much harder for less money on any future similar
job with the same caeky. Some men, by bullocking,
earn fair money at the lower rate, but after a
few years’ rip and tear, they are useless to the com-
munity, socially or otherwise. “Cheap beer” doesn’t
often fall to the swaggie’s lot, and as to “ liv-
ing on workers,” the real loafer is about the
towns, which he won’t leave to look for work.
I was offered a job in the Hunter River district last sum-
mer of drought. Cocky commented on the terrible time
and the unemployed. “ Can’t give more than 10s. a
week.” Routine of work : Milk cows, feed calves and ,
pigs, before 6 a.no. ; breakfast; digging ’taters or hay-
making all day ; then cows, calves, pigs, horses, and chop
wood to wind up—l 4 hours a day. Crops, fair; maize,
looking well; lucerne, splendid ; record prices ; income,
thrice that of an ordinary year ; yet that cocky couldn’t
resist the chance of taking down a toiler. As for
“ wastrels,” I’ve carried the “ drum ” with men who are
now leading lights in mining, business, and agriculture,
and I know of an M.P. who onee carried the swag. As for
settling down, how would 300 or 400 men exist for nine
or ten months between harvests in (say) the Narromine
district if they settled down ? They have to use the road
in order to get to harvesting, or shearing, or other tem-
porary jobs. They have to use the road to get away
again when the job is over—to get away to other jobs.
And they can’t be seen on the road without some bril-
liant person like “ Cocky ” denouncing them as wastrels.
Apparently, he thinks the real worker travels by balloon.

When the roses of life are faded,
And the warmth of the colors die ;
When the laughter is tinged with sadness,
And ends in a plaintive sigh,

Paint the days an amber hue,
Heed not the brand or the maker,
For any old beer will do.

“F.H.R.”: “Janor” (B. 18/10/’06) says
“to scoot from a snake when no weapon is handy is
prudence bordering on cowardice.” Now, I’ve lived
all my life in the bush, and have only heard of
one man who ever killed a snake by jumping
on it, and I merely heard of him. Of course, lam
speaking of the deadly species. I have often seen
men catch and hold between their fingers small
puny whip or ring snakes, but the bushman who
hasn’t served his time in the Botanical Gardens
has the greatest respect for the writhing serpent,
and I give him credit for it. I myself have backed
away from both the black and the brown snake.
One escaped because protected by thick quince
scrub; the other I killed, after half-an-hour’s
engagement, with a stone. There were only
about three stones in that cultivation paddock.
Now, I’ll back myself to kill snakes all day, any-
where, with “Janor,” fora fiver, as soon as The
Bulletin decides where the reptiles are thickest.
But that yarn about jumping on them is, in ten
cases out of nine, pure skite. Do you hear me ?
—SKITE.

“ Jumbuck ” : In B., ll/10/’06, “ Paul
Cupid ” tells “ Gip ” that she was in error concern-
ing the acrobatics of a snake-bitten bullock, and
says that snake poison affects all animals alike,
and is similar in its effects to any ordinary nar-
cotic poison. Well, it’s “Paul” who is wrong—
he only half knows what he is talking about, and
there is no reason whatever for doubting “Gip’s”
statement. According to Dr. Frank Tidswell, in
his recent pamphlet on Australian snake venoms,
the action of snake poison would appear to vary
according to the quantity injected and the
situation of .the bite. If a large quantity
be injected, or, if it passes directly into
the circulation through one of the blood-
vessels, there are often violent convulsions
and performances, swiftly followed by death. But
if the poison is injected into the fleshy tissues,
from which it gradually passes into the circula-
tion, then are seen the well-known symptoms of
creeping drowsiness, as in narcotic poisoning,
followed by death, after some hours or even days.
Cases of the former kind are comparatively rare,
which accounts for “ Paul’s ” not uncommon
error.
THE LUCKLESS WIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wandered, heedless, ’neath the stars,
With head uplifted to the Night,
Where, like a diamond, sturdy Mars
Plashed forth by turns his dual light.
Till, roving thus, with leisured stride,
I grew aware how, at my side,
There paced—the Luckless Wight.
Erewhile of Luckless Wights I’d heard —
It takes a deal my soul to daunt,
Ye.t I had dread, ere passed a word,
This was some spectre, come to haunt.
He looked so ghostly ’neath the light
Of stars. He was a Luckless Wight,
And he was lean and gaunt 1
“ Thou art,” I quoth, “ a Luckless Wight! ”
(The fact was obvious enough).
“ But why, upon my startled sight—
I mean it not as a rebuff—
Dost thou obtrude so silently?
What canst thou hope to gain from me ? ”
Maybe my tone was gruff.
“ I am a Luckless Wight, alack 1 ”
In hollow tones and hoarse he spoke.
“ And times are bad and things are slack,
And, though I am not one to croak,
My hat, I own, has lost its shine —
Nay, more, a deeper woe is mine,
I’m almost stony-broke."
“ Dost hope to beg a coin ? ” I cried,
And hardly thought it would offend ;
But he with dignity replied :
“lama gentleman, my friend,
And though, maybe, in innocence
You put that query—still, offence
Was latent in its trend !
“ A favor—not a coin—l beg ;
An easy one to grant, I think,
I’m on my last financial leg—
I haven’t got two coins to clink.
But with this one —my only prize —
I scorn to moisten with the flies,
So come and have a drink 1 ”

“ The Prooshan ” : The abolition of fees
will come as a great blessing to the teaching folks
in N.S.W. public schools. The threepenny call
proved an awful worry very often when “last
Friday in the month ” came, and Johnny's mother
“hadn’t no change,” or “father’d give it yer a
Monday if he got paid,” or would liquidate the
debt “ when scalp day comes.” Teachers often
paid for defaulters in order to save voluminous
special report making. There will now be three less
returns per month to render, no half-yearly free
application forms to submit, no money column to
keep in the quarterly return, no tedious cross
checking in search for the elusive threepenny in
the roll-book columns at quarter end, and no
money order or postal note to hunt for at the post
office nine miles away. So there will be much joy
in the camp all round.
“ Deeby ”: Be “ Kulpara’s ’ ’ advice (27/9/’O6),
to let blowflies at a sore to cause a speedy heal-
ing. It is wonderful that in these days of prac-
tically free education, people should keep to such
myths. Another allied superstition of the bush
is that if meat (cooked or raw) has been flyblown,
you have only to brush off the maggots and boil
it, and the meat is as good as ever. The poison
generated by the blowfly’s maggot is of such a
nature that no amount of boiling will neutralise
it. Violent retching, with symptoms of acute
poisoning, are often caused by eating meat that
has been flyblown.

George Caley, Government Botanist in
1804, gave the name Banks to the highest hill he
reached when exploring the Grose River (N.S.W.),
and the place went on the records as Mount
Banks. Thirty years after, Major Mitchell,
Government Surveyor, changed the name to
Mount King George. Present-day admirers of
Banks applied, a short while back, to Premier
Carruthers to get the Lands Department to
restore the earlier name, and, after hard thinking,
Joey said yes-no. It is officially notified that the
place is to be henceforth known as “ Mount
Banks, or Mount King George.”

New York records the champion lucky
escape. A yachting party (eight people)
was run down by a string of refuse scows going
out to sea with rubbish. Four of the party clung
to the yacht, and were saved. The others dis-
appeared. One, Miss Day, turned up again.
When thrown into the water she sank, but she
rose again under one of the scows, which just then
had opened its trap-door to shoot down the
rubbish and thereby silt up the clean Atlantic.
She rose through the trap-door into the scow’s
refuse receptacle, and some time later was found
imprisoned there—very much frightened, very
much disgusted with her quarters, but little the
worse.

“ F.H.R.” : When some men attain a cer-
tain financial position their whole object in life
seems to be a “ bust.” We all know the man who
gambles and the man who drinks,
but Big Alick was of neither
species. He neither drank nor
gambled, but he went on his bust
just the same. I once knew him
gain the giddy affluence of 30s.
Then he got restless. “I
wish a hawker would come
along,” he’d say, and would
sit on the road for hours
looking for one in vain. I
told him I’d seen a Hindu with
a bundle at Tcogong a week ago,
but “Lord knows where he is
now,” I said ; “ he’s had time to
get to Forbes.” Alick’s face lit
up. “I’ll find him,” he said.
“ Leave it to me, Fred. I’ll find
him if he’s in the bush at all,” and
off he went. For three days I
saw nothing of him. Then he
returned with his 30s. worth tied
up in a red silk handkerchief.
He was pale and haggard, but
happy. He was happier than a
honeymoon. He had a tin look-
ing-glass, some fancy studs with
glass diamonds, a lead watch and chain that went
while you wound it, and an iron razor. The
darky had given him the handkerchief in.

“Yarrum”: Not generally known that
the ink-weed plant—commonly met with all over
Australia —possesses greater curing and healing
properties than, perhaps, any other herb or plant
known. At Bungendore (N.S.W.), I once saw a
farm-hand have his forearm cut to the bone with
a reaping-hook. It was a ghastly sight; but a
poultice of ink-weed was applied, and, in three
days, one could scarcely see where the hook had
passed. ' Since then, saw a horse at Broadmeadow
(Newcastle) staked to a depth of four inches. A
poultice of ink-weed cured the animal in a remark-
ably short time. For fistula and strangles there
is no better remedy on earth. The ink-weed
should be looked after.
“ A. 8.” fools with a gun :
It’s curious how bad-tempered some men get if you
level an unloaded gun at them. Saw Tanner sitting in
his hut the other night piecing together an old gun. He
said he had taken it to pieces and cleaned it out, but as
the lock and trigger were broken, he reckoned it was no
chop.
I picked it up curiously, and levelled it at him for fun.
“ Don’t do that 1 ” he roared, jumping up in the air.
“ Don’t you know better than to point a dashed gun at a
man ? ”
“ Why, you said it wasn’t loaded,” I replied, astonished
at his alarm.
“ Well, whether it’s loaded or not,” he retorted, “ don’t
point it at me. I don’t like it! ”
“ But how on earth can it go off ? ” I reasoned.
“Nevermind! I don’t want ter argue about it,” he
grunted. “ All I say is—don’t point it at me 1 Aim at a
dashed lizard or something if you must aim.”
“Now, look here, Tanner,” I remonstrated. “Didn’t
you just say that you had it to pieces and cleaned it out,
and that the lock and trigger are broken ? ”
“ Yes,” he assented, “ I know I did, but ”
“Well, then,” I exclaimed, waving the barrel in his
direction again without thinking, “ how the ”
“ Don’t do it! I tell you!” he bellowed, ducking his
head. “It might go—well, anyhow, what dam sense is
there in messing about with a gun ? Gan yer tell me ? ”
I was about to answer when the stock and barrel
parted in my hands. “There now 1” I said, laying the
stock on the table ; “ are you satisfied now?” I pointed
the barrel at him to look down the bore, and in stepping
backward-, bashed my heel into a kerosene-tin and
tripped. With a wild whoop, Tanner passed through the
window and took the sash with him.
As soon as I finished turning handsprings, I rushed to
the window and shrieked out, “ What’s the matter,
Tanner? ”
“ What’s the matter? ” he echoed, rushing back into
the hut at me, and snatching the empty barrel. “ Give
me that flamin’ gun, you 11 ”
He’s a bit of a curser is Tanner !

Chinese mining tools in the Northern
Territory are just the same sort of tools that Ham
Fat was using when England was painting itself
blue, and banging its neighbor with a bone club.
Half-a-dozen sorts of quartz-crushing “ battery ”
were discovered by Herbert Basedow, who went
rooting over the fields lately with S. Aus. State
Geologist Brown. The simplest sort was made
by taking a log 3ft. long and 3in. through, and
shaping it something like a bottle. The crusher
held his battery by the neck, and pounded the
stone with the bottom of the bottle-club, which
is shod with any old metal. On the next
step up the scale is a mallet, shod with
half-inch angle iron. Another battery, generally
used for crushing tin-ore, consists of a heavy flat
log fixed up like a lopsided see-saw, with a pestle
on the heavy end. The Chow jumps on the light
end of his see-saw, then jumps off, and the pestle
goes bang on to the ore. When the Chow gets too
old and weary to play see-saw all day, he selects a
small tree, bolus a long pole loosely on to it, hangs
a heavy log on to the pole, and smashes up his ore
by working his lever (with the log on the end of
it) up and down. An energetic Chinaman wouldn’t
take more than a couple of years to put through a
40-ton crushing with any of these ancient imple-
ments. But, as a matter of fact, he rarely puts
through more than about that number of pounds
at a crushing.
OLD ROVING DAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ve had my share of ups and downs,
And now I smoke and ponder
On places far from stuccoed towns
And pleasant days out yonder ;
Of days when my old mate and I
Rode through the world together,
Until I left him there to lie
Beneath the Western heather.
Beyond the further range of hills,
Across the downs, and over
An endless turf that summer kills,
A low mound hides the rover.
All round him burns the summer tide ;
The migratory swallow
Nests, after crossing regions wide,
Beside him in the hollow.
He was my friend in golden days,
When bushward we were faring ;
He succored me in barren ways,
And cheered me when despairing.
Though many years have gone since then,
And time has brought its changes,
I’d give up all to be again
His comrade in the ranges.
Those were the days of rare delight
I dream of, growing older ;
But Death’s white hand stretched thro’ the night,
And touched him on the shoulder.
So that he bides beyond the hills ;
Across the downs, and over
An endless turf that summer kills,
A low mound hides the rover.
And there my spirit halts with him,
Lest he should feel forsaken.
And dreams of Bush Valhallas dim
Where we shall re-awaken.

taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
Micawber : Sydney trams are instructed to go
slow on Sundays past all churches when service is being
held. Insectarianism doesn’t have anything to do with
the matter. The trams, indeed, show the same respect to
theatre matinees....Mac. : Humor too laborious....
M. J. : Feeble allegory; and even 10,000b.p. allegories are
not too popular in this office... .Mahoe : No drug cure is
an atom of good for phthisis. Sleep in the open air ;
adopt an open-air working avocation if you can ; practise
deep breathing ; eat as much nutritious food as you can
comfortably digest; and you’re doing all you can to help
Nature. On the other hand, protect your neighbors by
carefully disinfecting and destroying your spittle. If
there’s a sensible doctor in your neighborhood, take
advice from him ; in one visit he should be able to tell
you all that will help. Phthisis is, in many cases, easily
curable by fresh air J. 0.: “Tiger” rather bald.. ..
Tadpole : Some smartness, but Tiie Bulletin is not dis-
posed to labor out its own attempts at jokes. Our jokes
look bad enough in four lines (after they’re printed).
Spread over 40 lines they’d be horrible... .Hermann G. :
Not in our line at a11....Nym.: A pathetic little grave-
verse, which happened to strike The Bulletin in a cheer-
ful moment, and rebounded off into the basket.... E. :
“ Let us frankly consider the subject of sexual morality.”
No thanks, especially on the basis of your assumption
that “ It is human nature for man to sin in his heart
whenever his eyes rest on the comely outlines of the op-
posite sex. The girl of 18, carrying herself with the pride
of life; the woman with the full-developed body—see
them anywhere, dressed anyhow, and they fan the ever-
burning desire in the healthy animal, which every man
should be.” That isn’t true, and it is just hoggishness
for all its euphemism. The natural, warm-blooded,
healthy man doesn’t look on woman in that way ; only on
one woman (or sometimes a few women) to whom he is
attracted. The man who lusts after every good-looking
woman he sees isn’t natural; he’s a freak, and a very ob-
jectionable freak at that Trapper : Tell your friend
he’s a hopeless fool, and bid him keep his £10....
H.8.E.: Hasn’t grip enough Queenie P.: “Hush” is
the best. You are improving, but have still hardly got
beyond the merely pretty.... Sammie: Too trifling....
Baggies : Not enough in it J.H.R.: It has no chance
of print M.J.M.: Too crude and juvenile, as yet—
T.F.J.: Both old—very, very old Elwyn : A rather
weak treatment of a hackneyed “ situation.”....M.J.
(M.L.) : Not quite good enough Yinix : Too carelessly
scrawled to get a fair chance... .Wanga: “D.T.” isn’t
unusual enough. You can send the other again, if you
wish R.A.V.: You are shaky in your facts, and not
very brilliant in your conclusions... .F.E.8.: Don’t care
for either. Too gushy and effusive Ruht Belch : Too
long-winded and prosy Coonamble : Has no strong
points about it J.S.B. : A gentle little nothing
Squib : Verses weak and irregular. We haven’t the name
you ask for A.J.B. : Well versified, but rather mean-
ingless J.G.D. : “ Last Years ”is rather good, but the
reflections are very trite. The other has no merit....
Bushgirl: Your descriptive touch lacks vigor and cer-
tainty G.: Story of the girl and the actor is beautifully
written, but climax unsatisfactory H.M.M. : The
theology of your verses is too comprehensive. Don’t care
to take the responsibility of so vast a statement Palie:
Three good verses. The last one weakens badly.....
Kemlap: Too long for us, in any case H.T. :
Good enough, but hardly in our line Yanko:
Bather dreary doggerel Cyril V.: Not too
bad, but we “pass” allegories.....H.S.C. : A wretched
attempt Cue : Sorry, still not up F.C.K. : Don’t
care for either of them.... Seraph : Can’t see any promise
in it M.Y. : Very tame and fiat... .Mint: Weak and
unhumorous Jeff Burton: You can’t write worth a
cent B.F.G. : Has some poetic flavor, but is otherwise
stiff and unwieldy T.C. : Hopelessly uninteresting
Goril: Sorry, but hardly up, though we’d do anything to
save you from that fate Engineer (1): Didn’t mean to
accuse you of thieving, only to intimate to you in our
own rude fashion that your idea had been better ex-
ploited before ; if we thought you were a thief, would
have been very much ruder. (2) Don’t agree as to
that yarn. Barring the names “Dave” and “Dad,”
there’s no similarity, and their very presence argues
against theft. An idea-lifter changes names first thing.
J.A.C. : Absurd to talk of the church bazaar raffle as.
“ the most iniquitous thing on earth.” It’s a swindle, of
course, but it doesn’t pretend to be anything else, andl
we’ve never yet met a man who embezzled money to
put it in a church raffle Vivian W.: No need to
employ a lawyer at all for naturalisation. The Common-
wealth offices will fix you up—by post if necessary
Shepherd’s Crook: Baa! Lulu: (1) We don’t w'ant
reprint as a rule. (2) Some of your pars, are interesting-
enough B.S. : The adverbs fight with the verbs, and
the adjectives aren’t on really friendly terms with the
text. They seem to be poor relations, or unwelcome
guests, and to feel it W.L. : Article wanders all round
the compass making admirable remarks ; but, unfor-
tunately, the remarks have been remarked before
Rambler : Rambles through a jungle of old phrases.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Swancott: Regretfully declined B.C.K. : Small,
blotty sketch of a dude committing suicide in a drawing-
room rejected F. B. : Nothing very promising in last
batch Hope: Even if the dog was a bosker that
hardly amounts to a joke.. ..J.M.N. : You would save a
lot of worry by putting name, address, and stamps on
back of pictures. Half-a-dozen letters come, stating “I
send some sketches,” and half-a-dozen sets of sketches
drop in next day or the day after, and the situation is
chaotic.

LONDON, Oct. 24.
Woman advocates of woman-
hood suffrage created a dis-
graceful scene In the Parlia-
ment building to-day. They
violently insisted that they
were entitled to the fran-
chise. When the police in-
terfered the leaders scratched
and fought until overpowered.
Some were carried into the
street kicking and screaming
hysterically, “Cowards, do
you call this freedom?”
One of the carcase butchers offered to allow Mr. Reid to choose his owu

could catch. —(Report of a deputation to N.S.W. Premier Carruthers on the
Abattoirs Question.)
Yes, on the whole, this would be more useful than anti-Sosh.
It is an injustice to the hotelkeeper

Under Ebenezer Vickery’s will about
£60,000 goes into a little N.S. Wales Methodist
parsonage. Rev. C. T. Newman, husband of one
of the principal Vickery beneficiaries, blows the
Wesleyan trumpet at Burwood, a Sydney suburb.
High Court Justice Isaacs hasn’t been able
to buy a wig to fit him. His head is narrow and
long—consequent!}' the wig which will stretch

“ Stony ” : The malapropisms recorded in
The Bulletin (4/10/’O6) might be added to by the
remark of Mr. Hohenlohe made at a function in
Hobart when he was there with his dog-of-war a
few months ago: “I haf not been to Australia
before, but now I am in your middle I know how
hospital you are.”
“N.L.” : Be John Pascoe Fawkner’s one-
eyed wife (B. 18/10/’O6). Possession of only one
good eye seems to have been something of a
Fawltner characteristic. I once heard an old-
timer tell a story that hinged on the blindness in
one eye of J. P. Fawkner’s father. The less said
about that story the better.
James Griffith, of Townsville (N.Q.),
selected to run for the Senate in the Labor in-
terest in place of Dawson, has been for many
years an engine-driver on the State railways, lie
will put up a big poll; every railway employee in
the State will be an active canvasser, and every
driver will blow the whistle hard in his interests.
THE NARROW WAY.
“Socialism,” said Mr. Deakin, “is impracticable at the
present time.” So is the Kingdom of Heaven to most
of us. — GEO. REID.
But especially to George or a man of his figure.
Announced, that E. W. O’Sullivan’s appli-
cation to retain the title of “ hon.” in the State
has been granted by the King. Thus even the
Keystone of the Democratic Arch chases the
butterfly of titular distinction. The metaphor is
as confused as must be the mental condition of
the man who applies to be an hon. “ within the
State only.” It’s so like being Mrs. Jones in
Mr. Jones’ house only, and down the street being
merely the woman whom Jones is keeping.
“ Dareel ” : Apropos of tips, sporting and
otherwise. Three years ago, heard T. M. Slattery,
at Canterbury Park races, say: “I have com-
mitted the indiscretion of owning a racehorse, and
already some of my friends are prophesying that
lam standing on the threshold of a gaol.” Then
he and his friends backed T.M.S. in a weak field
at 6 to 4 on, and it ran second to a 10 to 1 chance.
State election before last, W. P. Crick, speaking
for Domain Perry in Surry Hills, and referring to
the somewhat barren doings of the See Ministry,
said: “ We are a team of almost untried colts so
far, but give us a three years’ run, and we will
put up a record that will take some wiping out.”
“Spring”: Witnessed a fine sight in
N.S.W. Assembly recently, when the gilded
Colonel Ryrie rose up in his place to settle the
affairs of the State. He looked commanding and
weighty in his fathom of imported grey tweed
suit. His eyes flashed and his firm jaw hardened.
His florid face paled under the intensity of his
ideas. Striding fearlessly to the table, he threw
up his head, expanded his chest, braced back his
massive shoulders, and, when the House had
become tense and still with expectancy, drew a
deep breath and suddenly exhaled a profound
“Haw!” Then followed a long silence, during
which the Kurnel gazed intently at the Chair.
After a time, the faint noise of the world trying
to slither round on its axis was interrupted by a
fierce “Um!” The military person swept his
eyes round the chamber until they rested on the
fiery countenance of Alfred Edden, with its mat of
silvery thatch. He must have at first thought
Alf’s face was a bush fire with a lid of smoke, for
he hurriedly seized the water-jug and nervously
filled a tumbler, but instead of quenching Alf
he gulped down half the tumbler’s contents.
Then he hauled out his embroidered handkerchief,
and wiped his mouth and mopped his forehead.
Several minutes had now elapsed and nothing
had been said. Booth, the Leichhardt bore, half
rose and then completely sat down again. The
Colonel had blighted him with his eye ; I dis-
tinctly saw smoke rise from Boeth where the
Colonel’s eye fell on him. Finally the warrior
took up his parable and said: “ I am, um ! (heavy
silence for about a minute) of opinion, ah ! that,
um ! the miners in my electorate, um ! are a fine,
steady, sturdy, intelligent, haw ! (another em-
barrassing delay) body of, haw ! um ! ah ! and ”
The Chair (harshly): “The honorable
member is irrelevant and out of order.” Then
the Colonel said “Ah! what! haw!” and sank
into his seat.
William Guy Higgs is mentioned as proba-
ble President of the next Senate. Higgs will be
45 in January, and has put a good deal of serious
work into his career. He is a product of the
country and city press, and carried a “stick” on
the Tory ramparts of S M. Herald and Tele-
graph in earlier days.
Said to be definitely fixed that N.S. V .
Chief-Justice Darley will shortly retire, and
be succeeded by the highly-capable Mr. Pilcher.
Also rumored that Justice Owen will follow the
Chief into retirement, and be succeeded on the
Bench by Attorney-General Wade, though that
gentleman recently declared in a public speech his
resolution not to make Ministerial office a step-
ping-stone to a judicial billet.
Archbishop O’Reily, visiting Sydney at
present, has authority over a huge diocese cover-
ing all South Australia and the Northern Terri-
tory. He was chaplain to the Westralian penal
settlement, to which the British Government sent
political offenders in years gone by. He was also
once an editor, and has taken a turn at setting-up
type. Although hailing from quarrelsome Kil-
kenny, where the cat tragedy took place, he steers
pretty clear of sectarian rows.
Ebenezer Vickery’s estate was valued at
£483,354 for probate—gross value, £509,474. The
lady he married a few months ago gets £ll,OOO,
and £6OO worth of crockery, &c. For “charities”
and the like be left in all about £9OO0 —say, four-
pence in. the £of his wealth. Many a man has
a whole sixpence, and hasn’t achieved half
the reputation for open-handed liberality to “good
causes.”
The deatli at North Melbourne of John
Sturt-ock, aged 87, leaves only nine survivors of
those who took part in the first Eight Hours
demonstration in Melbourne half a century back.
In those days the unprophetic Argus ridiculed
the whole business, but the Eight Hours movement
seems likely to be alive when the Argus has
finally gone into the waste-paper basket of the
gods.
One of Sydney’s pioneer engineers died at
Concord (N.S.W.) the other day, aged 85.
William Coles was born at Portsmouth (Eng.),
and came to Sydney at the age of 27 as an Im-
perial service officer. He was first Superin-
tendent, and, later on, Chief Inspector of Public
Works, and was associated with the late Govern-
ment Architect (James Barnet) in the construc-
tion of Fort Denison, South Head Lighthouse,
and other old buildings.
Mr. J. H. Jarman, of the Narrandera
(N.S.W.) Ensign, is raising funds to put a
memorial stone over the grave of Phil Mowbray
(“Scotty the Wrinkler”), who is buried in
Narrandera Cemetery. “Scotty” was widely
known in Australia through his writings in the
“ Aboriginalities ” column, and probably many
friends would like to contribute. Money should
be sent to the Ensign, Narrandera.
Dr. Newman, Maoriland’s violent football
barraclcer, recently announced that he had traced
the origin of the Maori to Persia, and that “ the
Maori is a Caucasian, but has become browned
by exposure to the sun.” Newman, who has
accumulated much wealth, is mostly a racehorse
owner and dog-fancier, and fills in his spare time
barracking for football and Prohibition. But
amid the horses and dogs and football he has
found time to trace the Maori right back to
Persia.
The late Isidore J. Blake, K.C., whose
entry into the profession of the law dated from
1836, at the King’s Inn, Dublin, was a somewhat
remarkable character. He was well known in
New South Wales and Queensland, and many
anecdotes of him survive. In the long ago Cap-
tain Robert Towns entered into partnership with
a Yankee, of the Scotch name of Campbell and
known in Sydney as “Tinker” Campbell (said to
have been the original of Sam Slick) in a coal
mine or alleged mine in North Queensland. The
partnership was not a happy one, and ended in a
law suit. Captain Towns’ solicitors retained
Blake, and sent him to Queensland to remain
there until the case was finished. Blake was “in
attendance,” and doing well for two years, when
the parties came to a private settlement, and he
was notified that his retainer was at an end,
whereupon Blake gravely remarked, “Well, now,
I am sorry, for I was just beginning to understand
the case.”

THE DORG: “ Now, then, old man, afore we goes

A pathetically droll figure in the scramble
for a Federal seat is that of Johnny Hawthorne
wandering round the Nepean. For what look
like ages Johnny hung about Sydney suburbs
saying “ ditto ” to Reid and M’Millan and Bruce
Smith, and because he said “ditto” and generally
behaved like a Johnny person, electors acquired
a habit of giving him votes. At one time he held
a pretty safe seat in the State Parliament. But
“ditto” lost its spell and Johnnyism lost its
charm, and the gaiety of the old man strikes the
Nepeanites like something left over from a funeral.
N.S.W. National Rifle Meeting, just
concluded, was the carnival week for Major
Legge —the conspicuous grafter of the Australian
military forces. Legge has charge of the rifle
clubs, and works them up with almost savage
zeal. In a recent law case, it was sought to*be
shown that Randwiek rifle range was unsafe, as
bullets could escape from it to private houses
beyond. Legge, to vindicate the range, paraded
over the alleged danger zone persistently whilst
firing was going on. That showed a cold-blooded
pluck, which even a soldier hasn’t always got.

“ Now, then, no muttering behind there!”
A well-deserved send-off: —
The dramatic circumstances of the death of postal
official Joseph Clarke, of the N.S.W. inland mail depart-
ment, help to disprove the common belief that the
Federal civil servant is a haughty toff, who strolls into
his office at 10 a.m., and leaves deeply bored at 4.30 p.m.,
and whose action in putting out his hand for his salary at
the end of the month is the acme of shamelessness and
“ hide.” By reason of theseverely economical methods of
the Australian Government, its officers have had their
noses to the grindstone ever since they were taken over,
and the grinding process has gone so far as to almost
amount to a scandal. The “ work back ” order is now
the rule, and not the exception, in nearly all the adminis-
trative rooms. Said order means that the officer works
on until 6.30, goes to his tea, and returns to toil from
7 to 10, or later. And all he gets is tea-
money (say Is. 6d.). Joseph Clarke was a bluff,
genial man, whose name was hardly ever heard
outside the Department, and yet his mind directed the
vast system of inland mails of the State, and wrestled
with problems of flood, drought and heat, broken bridges,
washed-out roads, delays through sunstroke, drowning
and sudden deaths, and all manner of problems. His
knowledge of the conditions ruling on every mail route
was amazing. These routes are laid out strictly. The
mailman, or contractor, agrees to travel, say, “ two miles
north to Frog Hollow, thence directly to Rafferty’s
Hotel,” &c. Clarke carried in his head such minute par-
ticulars that he was able to tell off-hand what sort of
grass flourished near Frog Hollow, and what sort of grog
they stored at Rafferty’s, although he’d never seen the
grass, and never sampled the grog. Whenever a mail-
man got bogged in flood time, or suddenly threw
up his grinding contract in drought time, the local
postmasters were wont to wire furiously to Clarke
for instructions. Perhaps the wires would be re-
peated to the old expert’s private residence, and,
after a long hard day’s work and worry, he’d rush off
half-a-dozen telegrams to the district, and before the anti-
Federal press had time to set up a howl about Federal
mismanagement, the machinery would be jogging deter-
minedly along again. Blit the strain settled him at last.
He was poring over a set of papers late at night at his
office when his brain gave way, and soon he was taking
the mail route to the place where there are no annoying
hitches, no droughts, floods, or dishonest mail con-
tractors, and, above all, no anti-Federal press.
Germany has had the one Consul, the
little-paragraphed Brahe, in Melbourne for 36
years.
It is proposed to celebrate the jubilee of
Responsible Government in Victoria, in a some-
what similar fashion to the upkeep in Sydney.
The oldest Victorian Minister now living is John
Dennistoun Wood, who was Solicitor-General in
the first O'Shanassy Government, 1857 ; he is
now resident in Tasmania, of which island he is a
native. The next is William Bayles, who was
Commissioner of Customs in the Sladen Govern-
ment in 1868 ; and the third is J. J. Casey, who
held office as Solicitor-General in the M’Culloch
Government of 1868-69. That is to say, these are
the oldest survivors who are generally known, but
very old ex-Ministers, long supposed to be dead
and buried, are always liable to turn up in the
most astonishing places and upset all calculations.
Poor old Sarah Smith, variously described
as Sarah Givens Smith and Sarah Gibbon Smith,
who seemed to have nothing much against her
except poverty and eccen-
tricity, was awarded two
months at Sydney Central
Police Court, last week. It
was mentioned in court
that Sarah claimed that her
husband had once been Pre-
mier of Tasmania. Curi-
ously enough, the only Smith
who was ever Premier of any
place hereabouts hung out in
Tasmania, and he married
(in 1851) a lady whose front
name was Sarah —Sarah Giles
Smith. She would be quite
old enough now for any
court to give her two months
—two months being one of
the Law’s regular remedies
for the burden of accumu-
lated years. Old ex-Premier
Smith is still living (or was
a very short time ago) in
England, at the age of about
87.
Rev. S. J. Hoban gave
his experiences at a “Pleasant Sunday After-
noon,” in Wesley Church, the other day. He told
how embarrassed he felt when on a recent occasion he
gave his arm to a finely dressed but drunk young woman
whom he found leaning against a shop window sur-
rounded by a lot of laughing young men. They zig-
zagged down the street, the observed of all observers, and
his embarrassment reached a climax when the young
woman’s teeth fell out and he had to gather them up.
And certainly it is awkward to pilot a young
woman who has had so much as to float her teeth
out. But Hoban is a very different sort of cuss from
the Judkins- Worrall brand. He is a real kind-
hearted chap, who, in his quiet way, does a great
deal of good.
The Bulletin hears from London that
Joseph Chamberlain’s health is far more precari-
ous than is openly admitted. A few weeks back
Fleet-street was expecting at any time to hear of
his death. Joseph is over 70, and he barely sur-
vived London’s recent heat-wave. The doctors
could not allow him to be removed from his town
residence. Even if he recovers he will be abso-
lutely unequal to the task of carrying on the Pro-
tectionist propaganda. And Arthur Balfour
cannot fill his place ; he is always too subtle and
metaphysical. Besides he, too, is not to be
depended upon, and, according to rumors about
London, was recently not only in danger of phy-
sical prostration, but also of mental break-down.
Lately, however, he has pulled round again and
has been able to resume “goff,” for a time at
least.
Senator Keating,
who has become Deak-
in’s Vice-President of
the Executive Council,
through Isaacs’ move
up to the High Court
Bench, should be a cer-
tainty for re-election.
During the last Deakin
regime he was practi-
cally the leader of the
Senate, although lum-
bering Tom Playford
nominally represented
the Government there.
Labor is running only
two Senate nominees
in Tasmania, and Keat-
ing’s votes have been
so straight that the
Labor support is bound
to go his way. On the
other hand, Anti-Sosh,
which keeps its love
in the cupboard, re-
cognises the solid work
Keating has done in
bringing Tasmania
nearer to Australia, whereas the island has
had nothing from the venomous Clemons but
bad advertisement it would have been better
without. Keating was the moving spirit in the
improved steamer service, and the head of the
movement to wipe out the Straits cable charges
and put all the Commonwealth on the same
telegraphic basis.
Holy Joe Kirton, who opposes Deakin in
the Anti-Sosh interest at Ballarat, angles des-
£erately for the support of the Protestant Electors’
league, and would probably get it were it not
that Joe was, a few years ago, howled out of the
Methodist Conference in Melbourne for his
alleged R.C. proclivities. During his career, which
commenced with delivering letters, continued in
the State Legislature, and finished with Ins
appointment to a fat sinecure as Trustee of the
Ballarat water supply, Joe has been every shade
of politics and has worked every bit of ground
capable of returning a color of votes The
R.C. vote helped to put Joe into the State
Parliament just before the historic Conference,
so Joe felt it was up to him to assure the Confer-
ence that nothing of the sort had happened. But
the Conference was a deep chrome color, and,
instead of accepting the statement, it howled for
his blood, and it is understood that Joe has
hardly stopped running even now. Kirton’s
trusteeship—a life appointment—made it im-
possible for him to remain a member of the State
Parliament; and it would be more decent for a
man holding a position under such conditions to
stand out of politics altogether. If the job is too
onerous to permit of his sitting in the Assembly,
there’s no reason why he should neglect the taps
of Ballarat to support Greid in the Reps.
THE POLITICAL NEGRO.
The Opposition attempted to belittle the Bill. It dealt,
however, with a reduction of duties on the South African
principle, and to reduce duties the Opposition will vote
till they are black in the face. (Laughter and cheers.) —
MR. DEAKIN, at Ballarat.
HOUSEMAID:
“G oo’ gra-
cious, Mr.
Reid, what on
earth has hap-
pened to your
face?”
G.R.: “ There,
there, Susan,
don’t alarm
the house. I’ve
only been vot-
ing for the
reduction of
duties. I as-
sure you it
is nothin g
worse.”
The burial of the body of Mrs. Nugent
Wade Brown, eldest daughter of Mr. J. M.
Antill, of Jarvisfield, and grand-daughter of
Major Antill, who came to Australia early in last
century with Governor Macquarie, in the family
graveyard on Vault Hill, Picton (N.S.W.), is
reminiscent of interments in the early days. Most
of the pioneer families made a point of being
buried in their own grounds, and didn’t get mixed
up with common bones. Colonel Johnstone had
a vault on his estate at Annandale, and Captain
Rowley, of the 102nd, was buried in his grounds,
at Kingston. Wentworth is buried at Vaucluse.
When Annandale and Kingston were cut up the
bony frameworks of their old proprietors were
re-interred at Waverley, and now it is under-
stood that the builder and improver is imperative
as to the removal of Wentworth’s remains from
the spot in which they have rested for over 30
years.

RECREATION
FOR
BUSINESS MEN
Active business men need! some form of
recreation which will take their minds com-
pletely away from office cares. Mere PASSIVE
entertainment is not enough—they want to
be active even in their pleasures.

THE PIANOLA PIANO
supplies just the kind of mental diversion that overtaxed business men ought to have in
their leisure hours. Music is a great tonic and stimulant, but more especially when you
have a hand in the making of it yourself.
THE PIANOLA PIANO does not play itself—it is not automatic. It is not to be con-
fused with inartistic machines that wind up like clocks, giving each time a repetition of a
performance identically the same.
You are the one who does the playing, and a large part of the enjoyment comes from
putting your own personality into the rendition, seeing how much expression you can give,
how many different ways you can play a given composition, and which is the best way.
Business men who find the cares of a strenuous life bearing
heavily upon them should investigate the Pianola Piano for their
own good as well as for the great pleasure it will bring every
member of the family.
We want to send (free of cost) an interesting book about this
instrument to every person who loves music, and would like
to have more good music in the home. Ask for Catalogue M.

“I have been recommended to try your tablets for in-
digestion.” We are hearing this from customers all day,
which shows how Senior’s Digestive Dinner Tablets are
becoming known and valued by thepublic. They are worthy
of-recommendation, being purely vegetable, they do not
artificially digest the food, but enable the stomach to do
so, and by their use the stomach is made strong enough
to perform its functions unaided. They give immediate
relief from acidity, flatulence, heartburn, and all stomach
troubles arising from mal-assimilation of food, and cure
the worst forms of indigestion quickly and permanently.
Senior’s Digestive Dinner Tablets make eating a pleasure,
and give the system the full benefit it should derive from
the eating of good healthy food. Being mildly laxative,
they keep the system in perfect order, and cleanse the
blood of all impurities, take away that blotched appear-
ance from the face caused by poor digestion, and make
the complexion clear and velvety, as it should be with
perfect health. Senior’s Digestive Dinner Tablets are
sold at Is. and 2s. fid. per box, or Is. Id. and 2s. 9d. post

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 30, 1906.
My Dear Arini.—
The army and navy joined forces on Wednesday
last to give Nelson and Trafalgar another whoop-
up. So many of our defenders were crowded into
Sydney Town Hall that an enemy might have in-
vaded the city and helped himself to half the
hotel counter-lunch of the metropolis before any
one could have mobilised himself in defence. Who
was left in charge of the regimental plate while the
warriors were giving Nelson their cordial approval
I couldn’t ascertain. I have read somewhere that
when the British army charges the enemy on the
coast of Afghanistan it does the act in a hollow
square, with the women and children and pro-
visions and the regimental plate chest in the
centre ; but that is a side issue.
The flagship’s band, which isn’t powerful but
sweet and soothing, played nautical airs at the
Whooping-up of Nelson, and did it in a “List!
ye landsmen” manner. Four little girl-pupils
of Miss Rose Lyons footed a hornpipe so gaily
that they wore encored, as also was Miss Annie
Perry for Del Riego’s “Happy Song,” which
suited her sweet voice perfectly. She wore pale-
gold silk and cream lace. Our Naval Brigade’s
best effort was Mascagni’s passionate “Farewell”
intermezzo. It also played “England Expects,
etc.,” whilst Nelson’s well-known signal was
being “h’isted.” with tremendous applause
from an audience which was so keyed
up that the mere mention of the word “Jack”
threw it into ecstasies. I believe if the hat
had been passed round just then in aid of an Aus-
tralian fleet, no one would have stolen the lining.
It was a time of generous sentiment and Soul.
The flags used were those of the present naval
code, which rather spoilt the effect. Why not
modernise things further to a marconigram, after
the manner of Paul ringing up the Ephesians on
the telephone ? Our handsome Admiral, who has
mystic letters walking soft-footed after his name,
even as a sand-bagger walks softly with his bag
after his victim in the night, left early to see that
the main brace was properly spliced. At least I
was told that was his purpose. Lady Fawkes, in
black silk with white aigrette in her hair, was
squired by Bruce Smith, who ought to try to get
a waist somehow. He must be a perfect worry to
his tailor. The French Consul and his spouse—
the latter charming in pink, with rosebuds in her
hair—and the Lady Mayoress, who wore pale
blue with glittering silver interludes about it,
were amongst the audience.
Mile. Antonia Dolores smiled and sang her
sweetest from amidst an artistic arrangement of
arum lilies and palms at her opening concert on
Thursday afternoon. She was in splendid voice,
and got through the programme of twelve songs
and several encores without turning a hair. “Ah !
forsb lui ” was sung with much expression, and I
liked the “Tarantelle” of Ambrose Thomas,
which Mr. Sykes (whose musical memory is a
marvel) tells me she has not sung since her open-
ing concerts long ago.
Everything seems so simple when Dolores lifts
up her voice in melody that amateurs rush round
to Paling’s after the concert is over, and ask for
“that easy song Dolores sings.” And Paling’s
people sell it, and that nice easy song, when
Dolores isn’t there to sing it, is as easy as a ballad
in Sanscrit, and as simple as a bright young
cuneiform inscription.
Four officers of the Pah’f’l, whose attentions to
as many prominent Sydney beauties were expected
(or some of them, at least, were expected) to cul-
minate in matrimony during the race season, have
apparently veered off from the objects of their
interest; and, if Attorney-General Wade would
allow it, people would be publishing the odds that
none of the events will now come off.
A Sydney lady, foreign in extraction, but
of the same country as most other people
in the matter of vanity, seriously per-
plexes her law advisers by persisting that
she was only 29 years of age when she mar-
ried. A substantial sum of money has been
bequeathed to her ; at least, the bequest is to a
lady who seems to be assuredly her, but who
must have been 39 when that marriage took place.
Her friends have wrestled with her in a desperate
struggle to increase her age, but she seems willing
rather to abandon the legacy. I would cheerfully
put 35 years on to my age for the sake of a good
legacy, and take off 40 after I had got it.
Mr« Donne, head of the Maoriland Tourist
Department, the man who holds the geysers in
the hollow of his hand, and re-lights the volcano
when it goes out, and turns on the bath-heater at
the Cold Lakes when they show a tendency to
freeze, gets a big advertisement in Maoriland
Hansard. Twice lately, according to Premier
Ward, has Donne been offered £lOOO a year by
private persons if he will leave his beloved
geysers and such-like, and attend to these
other persons’ business. Each time he has
refused —and what wonder ? It is an ideal
billet to steer the scenery of a place like
Maoriland, to have charge of the beauty spots, to
brush the flies off the Alps, and pick the cockroach
out of the cataract, and see that the glacier is re-
painted when it shows signs of disrepair. Donne
is an enthusiast at the work, and the scenery does
him credit, and the tourist sings his praises every-
where —in fact he has organised a model Tourist
Department and one that just about beats
Creation.
Several Sydney-siders are bound for the Christ-
church (M.L.)Exhibition —the Spencer Bruntons ;
Mr. Remington, of the Mutual Life, who is
entitled to wear a lot of Masonic finery ; and Mr.
H. C. L. Anderson, head of N.S.W. Intelli-
gence Department, amongst others. Sydney
Tourist Department has been notified that
there is accommodation in Christchurch for 17,000
visitors to the big show. The seventeen-thousand-
and-oneth will have to sleep on a billiard table.
The Housing Committee canvassed all the hotels
and boarding-houses, and a scale of charges has
been drawn up so that tourists may know what
they have to pay. It may be that in the end they
will pay a great deal more, but they have at least
the knowledge to go on with. Prices range from
15s. to 255. weekly at the modest boarding-house
to 15s. daily at the best hotels. Also, it is inti-
mated that the most swaggah homes, whose corri-
dors have never yet echoed the footfall of a
boarder, and where no strange voice has yet
been lifted in complaint about the stew, will
open their doors to the paying guest. In fact,
all Christchurch is understood to be ready to
make hash for the visitor within its gates.
Miss Rawson and our Ex. had a busy time at
Goulburn last week. The day’s work included a
train journey, official welcome at the Town Hall,
Bishop Barlow’s reception, and a Masonic Lodge
meeting. Miss Rawson visited Bishopthorpe
High School for girls, and Sir Harry opened the
“All Nations Fair,” amid vociferous cheering.
Two local musical societies presented him with the
inevitable lyre, in gold, while Miss Rawson re-
ceived one of these instruments in silver, so they
got something more than virtue’s sole reward.
The women of Australia are going to bless Bill
Lyne for his Commerce Act. Henceforth silk is
to be silk, and wool the stuff that grows on
sheeps’ backs and not a vegetable product. We
may venture to buy the underskirt that “frou-
frous,” for it won’t be a mixture of metal and
glass now, but the real thing.
On Friday Miss Rawson, accompanied by aido
Wilson, visited Mosman to open the fete in aid of
the Home for Incurables, and was received by the
mayoress (Mrs. Leahy), Dr. and Mrs. Arthur, and
many other residents of that ideal spot with the
red roofs and the exceedingly various architecture.
So many affairs have been opened that it is a
relief to find something closed. Mr. Mann, secre-
tary of the National Art Gallery, announces that
the weekly talks on art held there have shut down.
Lady Northcote attended the first, and since she
left the audience has diminished till the vanishing
point had almost been reached. Art will now
have to get along without being formally talked
about.
Cardinal Moran, opening a church building
at Golden Grove, Sydney, of course said some-
thing pretty about the charming name of the
suburb. But he might have spared the compli-
ment. Golden Grove is, of all places around
Sydney, the most dusty, dreary and dismal. It
has as much suggestion of a “ grove ” as a railway
yard has of a meadow, and the jam-tins which
adorn its fields can hardly be called “ golden.”
A curious fact—in the main it is a fact—
is that a suburb which is given a poetic,
pretty name drifts rapidly to dusty drabness.
Consider Sydney’s environs, for example. Golden
Grove, a dull patch of terrace houses and mean
streets; Auburn (“sweet Auburn, loveliest village
of the plain ! ”), a dismal village adorned by meat-
works ; Surry Hills, an area of hard pavements,
hard-faced houses, and harder-faced citi-
zens ; the Glebe, a crowded nest of cheap
suburban villas permeated with the warm blood
fumes of the abattoirs; Tempe, a dismal,
straggly fiat, with hardly a decent house;
Botany, suggestive of flowers, but a Hades
of bad smells and offal mills ; and so on. There
are nice suburbs with nice names. But their doom
is only postponed. As the city grows they will
begin to reek, and the poetry and beauty of sub-
urban life will linger at places called Smithtown
and Jonesville.
Boots and shoes are getting lighter and lighter,
and thinner and thinner. Patent leather has
given place to glace kid, so fine as to be glove-
like and as pliable as glove-kid. Someone
in London has been asking foot-wear artists to
make silk boots, or open-work boots of lace—all
on account of the heat. But don’t the very thin-
soled, light-uppered foot-houses keep one re-
minded of the hot pavements ! There are days
in summer when that pavement is like the lid of
Hades, and the graceful person with a mere shred
of hoof gear is like the individual in kid gloves
who dances on his hands over the crust of an
active volcano.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly’s entertainment at “Glen-
yarrah,” Double Bay, last Friday evening, was a
brilliant affair. There was dancing in a marquee,
supper in the billiard-room, and moonlight effects
on the water, with champagne-cup interludes
through the evening. About 200 guests said
“How-d’ye-do?”—not simply “Howdy?” which
is American, I believe —to Mrs. Kelly and her
sister, Miss Mollison.
Glorious weather was provided for the Royal
Yacht Club’s garden party, at the club grounds,
Neutral Bay, on Saturday afternoon. A spank-
ing breeze raised such a sea in the harbor that
getting aboard any of the yachts was some-
thing of a feat. A band and the inevitable
cup of tea helped things along on the lawn.
Dressing was rather airy for the occasion—chiffon
and lace are out of place on the briny. One girl,
who received about half a bucketful of the sad sea
waves in her lap while crossing from the pier to
the vessel’s deck looked marline-spikes at the
man at the helm. What she looked like to the
man at the helm in her damp diaphanousness I
shall not say. One dark-eyed, French-looking
damsel, in white, embroidered muslin, with a
wine-colored, rose-laden hat tip-tilted over her
nose, and white suede boots laced on tiny feet,
left an “Ah !” of admiration behind her every
time she passed a naval man. It is understood
the navy drops to its knees as one man at the
approach of a pretty foot.
Miss Blanche Pike, one of the principals of the
Collegiate School, Mosman, writes that her
nieces, the Misses Christabel and Alma Wells,
have been engaged to play at the Maoriland Ex-
hibition. These clever girls have just returned
from Leipsic, where they studied violin and
piano under the well-known master, whose name
sounds like “ lettuces, ” spoken with a potato in
the mouth.
Friends in Sydney of Mr. Ernest A. Watts
will rejoice to hear that his chestnut filly, Mar-
cristine, won the Keddlestone (Eng.) Plate, and,
incidentally, a hundred sovereigns and a lot of
bets for her lucky owner. She did it in very good
company, too. Mr. Watts does quite a lot of
things. He is a barrister, member of the Stock
Exchange, and owner of racehorses, and he dabbles
in literature in his spare time.
The undressing is more startling than the
dressing in “The ‘Dear’ Doctor,” which has been
running, mostly in the cause of charity, at the
Palace during the week. Miss Jean Maclurcan,
piquant in white muslin, blue sash and white
lace hat, and Miss Constance Hadfield, in pale
blue, with high-crowned hat trimmed with white
feathers (which had a habit of breaking away and
dangling down her back), as the “precious jewels,”
Pearl and Ruby, looked well, but their costumes
E ailed after three acts. The Doctor himself made
is audience gasp by removing most of his attire
in the midale of the stage, and when he appeared
clad only in his angel suit, a won m near me
said, with a sniff, “Pm glad I didn t bring
Jemima ! ” I presume Jemima is a gushing child
of nature.
This farce is, in parts, so risque that I could
hear the audience blushing. The doctor gets
most of the limelight and nearly all the kissing.
The latter must have been well rehearsed ; it was
so well done. Miss Vera Wallis, the olavey, who
works for the doctor and his landlady on the
halves plan, and who installs herself as the
“ local demon ” when he is away, had most of the
work on her shoulders, and acted with spirit.
Miss Ola Humphrey takes full advantage of the
one opportunity for dress display in the part of
Glory Quayle by wearing, in the fourth act, a
lovely gown of sequined net, in pansy shades, over
pale-blue chiffon, which rustles and glitters in a
snaky way as she moves about. A wreath
of green leaves in her chestnut hair
gives a Greek effect pleasant to behold.
When Ola takes out her hairpins and the mass
of curls comes down the d.c. gasps. Only a
very scarce kind of girl could venture to do this
before her best boy without frightening him away,
but Ola, knowing her back hair is above suspicion,
cries “Kiss me, John!” And John kisses her
till the curtain comes down.
The many medals and certificates won at the
last Trinity College exam, were presented to the
successful candidates at the Y.M.C.A. Hall on
Tuesday evening by Mdlle. Dolores, who shook
hands with all the winners, and seemed as
pleased as they were. Miss Nellie Marks,
pupil of Cairos de Rego, gained the chief
award —the Associate gold medal, which
Dolores pinned on amid much cheering.
Miss Marks, who looks about nineteen, comes
from Ash field. She has broken a record for
this exam., having gained more marks than any
candidate has ever done before. (This looks like a
bad pun, but the remark is perfectly innocent.)
She wore a white dress trimmed with sequins,
and, though obviously nervous, played part of
Beethoven’s great “ Waldstein ” sonata excel-
lently.
Lady Manning, Mrs. Boesen, Judge Heydon,
Franz Wells, and Cairos de Rego supported
Dolores on the platform. The singer wore biscuit
voile with cream lace, diamond earrings, and a
turquoise ribbon in her dark hair.
A notable wedding set down for this Thursday
is that of Miss Edith Allen—of the Waverley
Allens —to Mr. Robert Sands, jun., son of the big
printer and newspaper director.
I respectfully nominate this laconic birth
announcement, which recently appeared in the
Brisbane Courier, for the blue ribbon in the
brevity competition :
LOVE—“ Glenkedron ” —a son. 22/10/’O6.
A pearl from Rose de Boheme’s London letter.
Writing of the motor accident, whereby the
Duchess of Connaught’s car ran over a child, who
died a few hours later in the hospital, she says :
“ The poor little fellow, recovering consciousness
at last, sent a pathetic message that the Duchess
was not to worry, and he was sorry he had run in
front of her car.” This shows what a tidy kid he
was, and how he fully appreciated the honor done
him by her Grace’s oil-chariot. His polite regret
for worrying the dear Duchess by being dead also
illustrates his humility, and proves that he under-
stood his station in life. He realised that it was
presumption on his part to intrude bis funeral on
the lady’s attention.
Parson P. S. Waddy, one of the cricketing
parsons of that name, gets the vacant head-
mastership of King’s School, Parramatta, about
the best-known public school of the Common-
wealth. The new chief was educated there but
graduated at Oxford. The trustees are careful to
announce that they selected Waddy, a mere Aus-
tralian with a mere Australian name—it couldn’t
have been more Australian unless he had been
called Boomerang or Corrobboree —on the recom-
mendation of the Bishop of London. Not on his
merits, you observe, nor on the recommendation
of any mere Australian bishop, but on the recom-
mendation of the Bishop of London. The Rev.
Waddy’s present job is that of Rector of Singleton.
The children’s dance on the Pah’f’l came off
yesterday, and all the nestlings from the stately
homes of Potts’ Point twittered round.
Mr. and Mrs. Horace Suttor and Miss Doris
Suttor are turning their steps homewards. They
have had a good time in Paris, visited many places
of interest in England, and have just done the
Lund o’ Cakes. Mr. Suttor took with him several
splendid photos, of Australian cattle, horses, flocks
of sheep, etc. (taken by his son Rawdon, who is a
gocid man behind the camera), with the intention
of exhibiting them everywhere. They will serve
as a splendid advertisement for N.S. W.
Mr. Cecil Pike, manager of the Bank of New
Zealand here, is off with his wife on a three
months’ holiday. While he is away Mr. Frank
Clayton, of the bank in Auckland, takes his
place.
“Rosna ” writes from Adelaide :
Adelaide’s municipal folk, the Theodore Bruces, com-
mit a great fist-shaking ehivoo on November 15th, when
some 4000 or 5000 goodly citizens are bidden to join the
glad throng and push the corporation paw up and down.
Another South Australian maiden has been wresting a
scholarship from all the warbling damsels of London.
Hilda Felstead, upon whom this town bestowed a com-
plimentary concert not long ago, has grasped the chief
scholarship at Trinity College, for which she will receive
two years’ tuition and £5O a year to squander in board
and lodging and other extravagances. Yet another
of our local products, violinist Doris Cloud, has won the
Tubbs gold bow for fiddle-playing against all-comers.
A third small ex-denizen of this State at present col-
lecting popularity in the country of Eull is the 10-year-
old elocutor, Wanda Radford. At latest, she was busy
being presented with necklaces and such by a procession
of admiring mayors. The clever child performed at
Aldeburgh, a large coastal town in Suffolk, and the
natives flew Australian flags and other curiosities in her
honor, besides entertaining her as though she were at
least a countess in her own right.
Adelaide Rowing Club burst forth into an opening
spree on October 27, and pursued itself up and down that
elegant sheet of mud and water, known as Torrens Rake,
with a good deal of enthusiasm. The club has a large
following of she-friends, to consume its bun and drink its
tea, and the opening function took on the character of a
young garden party, minus the usual shortage of pro-
visions. A garden party, at which there is enough food
to go round, is an unexpected event in this economical
State. Probably the fault lies with the eating capacity
of the guests. I know several “ good housekeepers ” who
make the family struggle through without lunch when it
is going to a garden party, so that it may be spacious in-
wardly when the provender comes around.
The death of Mrs. Corbin sets a large number of S.A.
folk a-grieving. Deceased was the founder of that useful
and entirelj' deserving charity, the Adelaide Crfeche.
Not even the bitterest of her fellow philanthropists spoke
ill of her, and that is saying much. Philanthropists are
usually a cattish race, and the opinions of a cat about an
alleged cat are bitterly uncivil. The philanthropist who
earns another philanthropist’s respect can be guaranteed
as being a philanthropist.
The end of Amy Sherwin’s Adelaide season did not
draw nearly such good houses as it deserved. The com-
pany is about the best this slow city has heard since Ada
Crossley charmed the multitude. Probably the beloved
Amy struck a bad thing in having her season sandwiched
between Dolores and Blanche Arral. Anyhow, that part
of the populace that didn’t go to hear her is hereby
advised to be sorry for itself. Madame Sherwin exhibited
at least one very gorgeous garment in this State, a pale
green confection, much be-sequined.
Travellers whisking back from the Ma-land tell
pretty tales of the airs and graces of a certain Australian
warbler now collecting laurels thereabouts. Various old
acquaintances, happening upon London, tried to look
the young man up by letter, but never a scrap of notice
was taken of their communications. Then the wife of his
old singing-master, who had piled kindness upon him in
his unripe days, took a jaunt abroad. She paid the
young man a surprise visit, and was received with much
dog and hauteur. He had purchased a complete British
outfit, accent included, and didn’t wdsh to be reminded of
Australia, where his father was a highly respected trades-
man. In fact, I doubt if he had ever heard of the place.
Divorce and devastation loom large on the horizon of a
certain scion of a moneyed and hand-fed Adelaide family.
The unhappy pair wrangled through several years in a
foreign land, and now the Him section of the family
comes flying home to file petitions and things, because
the lady’s off-hand nature is too much for him.
From Brisbane :
Lady Chelmsford and Miss Du Cane returned to Bris-
bane from the South on Thursday last, and seem to have

Invitations are out for a musical evening at the Vice-
regal villa on the 9th. Certain local musicians will
endeavor to make themselves heard over the hum of
conversation relating to babies, and the misbehaviour of
Martha, the household drudge and “generally useful.”
Lord and Lady Chelmsford visited the Nndgee
Orphanage (the place where the little boys who can
make their own beds come from), last Friday, and the
usual nice things were said in the usual tired, nice way.
An amusing story has leaked out over a recent and
very fashionable wedding. The bride was very late
indeed, and the waiting so got on the nerves of the im-
patient bridegroom that he fainted. Not right away,
you know, but just limpish. Anyhow, he was promptly
hustled off into the vestry—and water not having the
reviving quality attributed to it by the Blue Ribbon
band, a small boy was armed with ss. and hunted off to
get spirituous comfort. Then several persons recollected
that the urchin was under 16, and couldn’t be served at a
pub, and they all promptly set out to “ get it ” themselves.
When the bride eventually turned up, she met a much-
restored groom, and a vestry that looked more like a bar
than any thing else.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 30, 1906.
Mr Dear Yabrie,—
Prime Minister Deakin foolishly ventured
into the Austral Salon, Melbourne, the other night,
and talked about the declining birth-rate to a
number of nicely dressed marms and spinsters,
who have put themselves under the heading of the
National Council of Women.” All things con-
sidered, the affable Deakin was rightly served
when an angry lady told him she was tired of
hearing that the birth-rate is just what women
choose to make it. With one eye glaring at Mr.
Deakin, and the other looking for approval from
her anti-Sosh sisters, this indignant matron pro-
claimed her ‘‘definite conviction that, in cases
where the decrease in tne birth-rate in any country
is due to any action, the initiative originates
generally in the first instance with the father.”
She suggested, therefore, that fathers should
be talked to on the subject, whilst the mothers go
and seek further instruction in the art of rearing
their occasional babies when they get them.
Whereupon another of the Council matrons advo-
cated castor oil as a most healthful food for in-
fants. She oils her own brood every day of the
week, with the result that “ they are dreadfully
thin, and grow to legs, and have long bodies.”
lheir thinness, she frankly admitted, is so awful
that “some people call them blowflies.” By this
time, probably, the Prime Minister has made up
* ns m jnd to talk no more of birth-rate to either
sex • Proportion of men and women capable
of being inspired to achieve parentage by a sense
of responsibility to the State is too insignificant
for a wise politician to worry about.
lhe Northcote Aide-in-waiting has been distri-
buting pasteboards the size of miniature hoardings
to Society and officialdom for a couple of
November junkets. The majority of souls bidden
to these crushes fret over the form in which the
entertainers have to be notified that the Bidden
will rush to be present. The Aide-in-waiting,
being requested by their Exes, to invite,” has
to be requested in return to tell their Exes, that
Society is mighty glad to have been invited. This
counts for almost Royal ceremony. Tryphena
was in an alleged smart family circle one" recent
eve, when four persons disputed the manner of
wording the reply, and an irate parent, glaring
over paper and specs., interrogated the dunces
"nth raised eyebrows as to the measure of their
stupidity. “ And after all the years I’ve spent
on the education of my family ! ” said his flaming
eyeballs. But the Aide-in-waiting has only come
between the invited and Government House since
the Northcotes landed here. “Stonington” in-
terposes no third person between guest and
Governor. Their Exes, ask Mrs. Brown point-
blank to come, and Mrs. Brown point-blank
arrives.
T V j, a^i n £ °f dogs! Mrs. Peterson, who owns
JJillaiah station, away in the hot North, about the
Gharleville region, where the Talbottle was lately
sn°ot in g ducks, has in her town leisure taken
U P c P ca P se abandoned, stolen, or sick yelpers
—the business once attended to by the Sisters of
the Church. The sisters found the Dogs’ Shelter
r,, expe^SIVe V, In a Populous part of East St.
JAilaa, Mrs. Peterson has put a detachment of
kennels. I here the canine waifs and strays are
housed comfortably for a fortnight. They have a
stylish dog diet, lots of fresh milk, a stretch of
flowery meadow to gallop over, and doice far
niente of the most luxurious order. They have no
burglars to eat and no work of any kind. If in a
fortnight, no owners come to claim them, the local
a ?Ki- ' ecar y supplies the anti-climax to this haven
of bliss, andthedoggies “drink prussic acid without
any water, and die like a duke and a duchess’s
daughter. With funds, Mrs. Peterson would
yelpers in their state of bliss and ease
till they gave up the ghost of their own canine
accord. That would be preferable to the prussic
acid ending, to her mind, and the squatteress
worries her friends to send in subscriptions to
maintain the pets in the lap of luxury : but with-
out much avail.
Phere are actually two “ paying-guest” estab-
lishments in this city for wealthy dogs. Two dog-
Todgerses have found that the four-legged boarder
pays better than the animal of large discourse that
looketh before and after, so they run boarding-
houses for well-to-do canines only. The owner of a
Pomeranian, say, owing to bridgitis, or any other
stylish complaint that takes up her days, hasn’t
time to worship the animal, and so she dumps
the pet down at Dog Bank or Pup Meadow, and
pays for his keep and care. One Todgers is a
Frenchwoman, and she re-christens the boarders
Mignonne, Pastille, Fifine, Cyrano de Bergerac.
Mum, and so on. She relates, as an example of
the edifying life followed in her Barkville, that
°“ e day a terrier guest escaped and entered the
church, and was found snuggled up there, having
probably exhausted himself at his devotions. He
was rescued, lectured, and put on bread and milk
without cream or chicken for three days. That is
designed to cure his religious instincts. But the
Frenchwoman has yet to learn that religion is
much harder to cure than to cultivate.
Signor Dane-Volenti’s is the first voice raised
in this land against the authority of Marchesi.
To hear this singer on the illustrious mar-
tinette of France is to have a rich and rare enter-
tainment. “For months I suffered for those
years of study under Marchesi, and from a train-
ing that only injured my voice. One day I came
across a hunchback accompanist. She brought
me all my luck. I commenced to recover my
health, my courage, my sick notes. She intro-
duced me to Signor Volenti. He was my saviour.
His tuition crowned me. His interest was
a big factor in my career. And then—oh,
well then—we found out that we were in
love. We were married. He’s one of the
first authorities of the voice in London
to-day. I thank the little hunchback for my
great happiness. Violet Clarke—daughter of our
ex-Governor—is now studying under Lorenzo
(Volenti’s front name) and Walter Kirby as well.”
But perhaps a lady who has married one singing
teacher is not the most unprejudiced of witnesses
as to another.
Perhaps the worst thing about Henley-on-the
Yarra is the name—it isn’t a bit like Henley, and
most of the circumstance, or function, or whatever
it is, transpires on the Yarra banks. But, it
becomes an “ event,” as the attendance, almost
up to Cup dimensions, shows. As house-boats,
the muslin-dolled barges are a fraud, but as
summer houses they are not so bad as they were.
If the scheme for planting a big dam across
the Yarra behind Kew were carried out,
then there would be a lake above the
dam, and miles of placid river reaches
whereon to disport for a week or so in genuine
house-boats, with steep wooded hills available for
spectators and tent-dwellers. That would pro-
vide the means for an ideal holiday, with regatta,
water parties, and other luxuries. The bouquet
and the background of the lower Yarra would
spoil even the Last Judgment as a spectacle.
But “Henley” was pretty, especially at night,
when a searchlight and a few electric globes in
the darkness go a long way. One small row-
boat that pervaded the course in the after-
noon was a joyous happening. Four posts
had been erected at the thwarts, and around
the tops of these ran lines of flowers, while up and
down at intervals were strips of pale blue and
white muslin, tied in the middle with white
ribbon. The whole concern looked like a bridal
couch, especially as a lady lay negligently back in
the stern on a pile of cushions while her cavalier
pulled spasmodically. As for the racing, certain
half-clothed youths went by at intervals.
The Alexandra or Kit-Kat Club had the gid-
diest boot-box trimmings. The Yarra bank
accepted the burden of saucy feminines that
showed from the club kennel with bad grace.
The excess of flippancy struck a jarring note.
The Athenaeum brotherhood won the cake for a
river dog-box of capacious size and orderly de-
coration. A solemn oak-brown, corrected by a
slightly coquettish blue, was a suitable tone for a
Yarra lodgement. And the club had a bevy of
blue-capped ice-maidens (snowy white was their
raiment) to hand round the tea and the straw-
berry. The Athenaeum Club, therefore, took the
prize. The ’Varsity kennel wasn’t big enough for
its hospitality.
The smart She hasn’t yet found a uniform
regatta rig. At the Henley turn-out she wore
transparent muslin, showing much girl and bebe
ribbon beneath, or a voile garb heavily burdened
with dado and fresco of lace additions, or a tailed
silk confection with lawn leanings. Only now
and then an appropriate charmer, neat as any
racing skiff, shot into view. Miss Hodges was an
example. She wore all white —a crisp, brief
white, with a head-piece also milky white. Miss
Atherton was rather over-crisp. Her waist was
too waspish, her little toque too rigorous. The
two Whiting sisters turned out as competitive
summer girls in pastel tones, lots of fluff, dimples
and shady millinery. .But the great swarm of
girl looked unequal to balancing on the narrow,
grassy bank in a proper Henley get-up.
Nine blithe, melodious years of shining at
Daly’s and the Gaiety Theatre have still left Miss
Olive Morrel with her complexion and her nut-
brown youth. Each is distinctly and beautifully
her own, and she is just young enough to be frank.
Only the young dare be frank. She chatters freely,
impulsively, and with a smile curled at the
edges. Nothing has happened—nothing what-
ever —protests the stylish charmer with a laugh.
No past, no diamond robberies, no sensational
rival tragedies, not even a parson dad to boast.
And here’s her tribute to the local needle-dodger.
“I didn’t bring a shipload of clothes because, from
what I saw of Australians, I concluded I needn’t.
They’re among the best dress designers in the
world. But 1 brought my puff. Oh, yes, I had
to bring a puff.” The lady with the delectable
front name and the starry eyes makes an initial
bow over the lights in “A Spring Chicken,” a
fact which has brought a rush of social stars to
book seats in the stalls. Later she plays panto-
boy. She hasn’t played boy before. She’ll be a
mild, piquant one, and shapely. Australian sun-
shine strikes the importation as being an unusual
joy. “I love it. Just say I’m simply alive and
happy and well. Eh ! what ? And that I find
things out here ripping.”
Tongues are fluttering about a divorce, the
papers tor which are said to have reached the
chief marriage-splitter, or whoever the proper
person may be. The husband is a high
official ; the handsome lady, who is charged with
things, is on the other side of the world. The
marriage took place in the far-away past of the
eighties, before the husband’s importance had
begun to grow on him. -
Governor Rawson and Miss have sent, through
the Aide, their testimony to the truly Australian
character of the hats they ordered from the
Austral Mills in Melbourne a while ago. The
vice-regal certificate of merit reads very like a
suggestion for higher duties against felt hats
which are not made in this country. Emphasis is
laid on the fact that the Melbourne goods are
“light, comfortable and well ventilated, at the
same time well finished, a good protection from
the sun, and very suitable for Australian climatic
conditions.” But what the hatmaker sighs for is
“ good Protection ” from the heavier and fever-
germed head-gear which is now coming to these
shores from Italy and the Jew quarters of New
Babylon.
Mrs. St. Leger Robertson supplements the
gaiety of the present heyday period by a party at
Menzies this Wednesday. Since her marriage,
the plump beauty has taken small part in the
Tooraketty whirl, but the issuing of Carnival
pasteboards looks as if she were taking notice
again. The St. Leger Robertsons are supposed
to have made a sublimely happy match—a thing
society is not likely to forgive them for in a hurry.
Mrs. Arthur Patten rises from semi-oblivion
to announce a concert on the final October eve.
As Miss Alice King she used to sing with much
sweetness and art. Report says the voice has
grown the richer for some rest-cure, and that it
can now soothe the salvage breast to some pur-
pose. Miss Emily Dyason will assist in the
soothing.
Three young dames have returned from abroad
with an infant apiece. It makes one reflect on
the all-round advantages of the globe-trot. A sea
trip, it seems, is good not only for matrimony but
for parentage.
There was quality and much empty space at
Miss Maggie Stirling’s outbreak of song last
week. The returned warbler hoped to win to the
Town Hall some of the gentry who had swarmed
in the track of the Dowager of Cliveden to the
Stirling welcome-home concerts. It was a vain
hope. A brace of vice-regals with a bodyguard of
caddies apiece breathed a duet of benediction
upon the big platformer, but benedictions do not
help the box-office receipts any.
Entertainer Leslie Harris gets some of his best
platform turns from the subject of the eternal
feminine. His sketch, “The Woman who Shops”
(and what woman does not shop ? Breathes there
a woman with soul so dead as never to rush the
bargain counter?) sends the showman and the
crowd into convulsive laughs. It is not much ex-
aggerated. From my own observation I find it
hard to decide which is the more trying—the
shopper who doesn’t know what she wants, or the
customer who doesn’t take it when she does know
what she wants.
Professor Osborne is developing the social bump
rapidly. Since landing here the English don and
his long, brainy mate have been exchanging
courtesies abundantly with the ’Varsity brethren.
The other Saturday they spree’d the entire
Princess Ida Club (a sisterhood of grads.) at their
Warrandyte home. Over billy-tea the club con-
fided to the cheerful Prof, that he was the first he-
being ever permitted at a Princess Ida spree.
And the amiable interloper looked as if he would
encourage the thing to happen again. But you
never know where a bad habit ouce started will
end. Having broken the ice with a professor, the
Idas may now aspire to work up the animal
kingdom until they get to the stage of taking out
a beauty actor and filling his soulful mouth with
tea and scones.
Miss Jean Langtree—one of the survivors of the
Tooraketty razzles of 1905—is back from a gad
with a high range of dress boxes and the latest
wrinkles in social starring. The charmer is said
to have made a record trip in packing her days
with pleasure and profit.
The Australian Club of bloated aristocrats,
sheep-kings, and mining swaggerers has issued
notification of the usual Cup hop at the Club
quarters on Friday. Several ddbuts, in suspen-
sion all the season, are billed for this junket.
Monsieur Lucciardi, theferocious-looking Consul
for Froggy-land, hastens to correct Tryphena.
Though a Corsican, he is not un petit-cousin de
Buonaparte. He doesn’t want to be. On the
contrary, all his family tree has shaken stormy
branches at the Napoleonic cause. “I am,” says
the Consul in declamatory style and freely-
damaged English, “a Revolutionary Socialist.
My father—my grandfather—my uncles—all the
Lucciardis —have held up arms against the tyranny
of the Buonapartes.” And he winds up with an
apologetic smile—one guesses it is a smile—behind
his extensive moustaches. He has been carried
off in his traditional emotion to tempestuous ex-
pression, but he pulls up, and is the chivalrous
gallant again.
The friction of a notably handsome couple has
taken definite form. A proclamation of sale has
been raised over house and furniture, and what
was a charming dovecot goes on the market as an
establishment divided against itself. And when
a house is divided against itself, the auctioneer
often sub-divides the grounds and sells them as
villa allotments.
Mrs. Winter-Irving secured the “Stonington”
party at her private residence by labelling a sing-
song “ for charity.” It must have been quite a
bona-fide charity, approved of by the Private
Secretary, who is ever deputed to look into the
genuineness of these little benevolent movements.
It's reckoned a fine thing by society to guide the
grey Grace into one’s own private Chippendale
chair.
The Westralian Exes—Admiral Bedford and
Co.—are housed at “Stonington” for the race
junkets. Two relay’s of aides are now turned
on to all the shows that the two lots of Yice-
regals attend.
The A.N.A. prize-winners had their trophies
thrust at them by an unthinking Talbottle, a week
or two ago, when the city of statues ran riot with
competition and the shouts of battle. Formerly
an urbane Chief Justice, with smiling enthusiasm
and a pat for every Tommy’s particular head,
donated the trophies with excessive grace. A
papal benediction, combined with a festive birth-
day greeting, was suggested in the chief’s presen-
tation manner, and Tommy scampered off in a
bright glow of gratification. The Talbottle Ex.
made an automatic jerk of each prize, and thrust
it upon Tommy and Co. with a highly tired air of
indifference. This kind of ceremony doesn’t suit
the lengthy Ex.
Miss Irene Dillon—a sprightly pirouetter of
forward talent, and a songstress to boot—has taken
herself off to a rural convent for a spell of rest
and language study. Finding herself fagged, she
struck the notion of a cloistered term, and a large
circle of heathen friends, who lifted their eye-
brows at such an unusual move, are only getting
them down by instalments. In some cases, it is
reported, medical aid will be required to get the
eyebrow back in its place.
Dr. Helen Sexton—the first of the sex to raise a
brass-plate in this State—at last breaks up a big
practice to jaunt to Europe. Dr. Sexton is one
of the plain-edged, solid, common-sense sort, and
her advice to foolish feminines has been as bene-
ficial as her prescriptions. The strenuous she-
medico will suffer no hanky-panky tricks on the
part of the ailing she. She is honest, downright
and kindly, and she has no patience with those
who confess to a wobbling character, and the
neurotic victim blushes for her hysteria and tired-
ness in the bracing presence, and under the stimu-
lating regard of Dr. Helen. There are few of the
learned sisterhood with the same grip on the
weak, or an influence as practical. Withal, she’s
a lovable tyrant.
Miss Beatrice Kerr—the slight young mermaid
who made her daily plunge in the Prince’s Court
pond last summer before a multitude that sadly
deplored so poor a successor to Annette Keller-
mann—is now challenging all aquatic Europe to
come and swim further and dive deeper than
herself. I looked long upon the neat, crisp, quite
clever aquatic turn of Miss Kerr at Prince’s Court
last ice-cream season, and wondered much that
the performance left one indifferent and un-
moved. Even its adroitness counted for nothing,
because the plunger was absolutely colorless in
character. There was no personality whatever
backing up the double-dive, and not an atom of
character in the breast-stroke. It was mere girl
giving an automatic show without faults.
Annette, on the contrary, thrilled one. Her
dripping, pomegranate-hued face was an appealing
joy. Her taut form was a glory. Her sema-
phoring limbs struck square at one’s emotions.
Yours Affectionately,
TRYPHENA.
This is a period in the annals of the world’s
history when no woman need be unlovely. The cult of
Beauty is not tedious, or difficult, it is not costly, and
(what is of supreme importance) it is not out of anyone’s
reach. Beauty is a power. Therefore, cultivate it. A
nourishing: Skin Food is absolutely essential. Valaze
stands alone as a Skin Beautifier. Its effect is certainlv
magical. All skin blemishes disappear under its purifying-
effect. It is a pure Herbal Skin Food, which builds up;
the skin, it works its way into the tiny pores, and removes
all the impurities, and imparts a clear, soft, transparency
to the complexion. After regular applications of Valaze
the skin becomes radiant. Valaze, according 1 to the
directions issued by Mile. Rubinstein, leads on to Beauty.
It cannot fail. . Three months’ use of Valaze will give you
a new complexion, it will rejuvenate you. In any skin
trouble consult Mile. Rubinstein. Be wise in time and
beautiful for ever.*
Richmond (Vic.) council lately considered
a suggestion for the establishment of a municipal
bakery, and the proposal to refer the question to
the public works committee was only defeated on
the Mayor’s casting vote. The Mayor and another
councillor, both pawnbrokers, were most strenu-
ous opponents of the proposal, foreseeing, as one
of them said, that it was only the thin end of the
wedge—presumably of municipal ownership of
pawnbrokeries, undertakeries, &c. But these
will surely come, even though there are three
pawnbrokers in the council.

THE NECESSARY COMBINATION.
He made effective use of the arguments against
Socialism and the Progressive Land-tax, showing the
necessity of combination of the anti-Socialists against
the Labor party on the basis of a fiscal truce.— ARGUS.
Brisbane City Council is in a financial
morass, owing to the incapacity of Mayor Crase
and others. The deficit on last year’s transactions
will be anything between £12,000 and £14,000.
After announcing this, Mayor Crase in the next
breath asked the Council to go to the pawnshop
for £lOO,OOO, with which to build a hall. Brisbane
has no sanitary system worth the name; it has
an unwholesome water supply and a huge debt.
It ought to meet in the gutter rather than in a
Town Hall Until it has remedied these things.
Recent heading from Bull’s Financial
News:—“Many Australian traders may have to

which merely requires them to be as honest as they
say they are. And the News pretends to be their
friend !
J. M. Chanter, one of the most consistent
Protectionists in the House of Representatives,
has a safer seat for the Riverina (N.S.W.) than
hitherto, through the addition of Wvalongto that
electorate. The Labor party isn’t running a
candidate there, and Chanter will poll the solid
Labor vote.
Secesh isn’t getting on so well as it did.
Monger, of Westralia, hasn’t introduced his
Secession Bill, after all, and there is a silence in
that quarter just now ; and Plunkett, of Queens-
land, who had a secesh motion on the notice
paper, cultivated a judicious absence last week
and let it drop.
The bishops of the Anglican church meet
in conference at Melbourne next week. Only two
laymen have been invited to speak to the gather-
ing, and only one politician—J. C. Watson, whom
G. Reid would have Australia to believe leads an
irreligious party, that has horrible designs on the
marriage tie and the purity of the home.
The secretary of the A.W.U., Ballarat,
writes: —

not “an unknown bookseller.” He is known, perhaps,
better than any Labor man out of Parliament as a
speaker; he is president of the combined Labor leagues
of Ballarat; was a delegate to the last Labor Conference,
and was selected by leagues all over the constituency by
an enormous majority over four other aspirants.
The Argus winds up its report of a speech

the Labor party’s platform and policy.” If
McColl can do an “exposure” of that size as if
he were lifting a curtain, or brushing away a fly,
he deserves to be elected at the top of the poll.
Strange to say, the Argus doesn’t give the
exposure.
* * Kathleen ” writes :
The other night, I was delayed at the office until close
on eight, and thought I’d refresh myself after so much
overtime by stepping in to hear G. H. Reid’s manifesto.
But I was stopped at the door of the Temple, because I
hadn’t any ticket. I inquired the value of the ticket,
and was told that money couldn’t buy it. It was the
sign of membership in the Australian Democratic Union,
and everybody who was outside that union would also
find himself outside the meeting. I glanced inside the
hall, saw that it was not one-third filled, and, smitten
with a sudden pity for the loneliness of the anti-Sosh
cause, made a second application to he admitted, so that
I could blot out some of the emptiness. The underling
with the tickets didn’t seem to think that my presence
would be much help. (I must mournfully admit that, in
point of size, I am nowhere near some of the dames of
the union.) So he shut me out unapoiogetically, and I
went away, assuring my better, juster self that the Six
Hatters outrage, and the Petriana murder, and the sad
case of Tozer’s wife’s maid, were avenged in a modest
way.
“T.D.”: The most malodorous of the
Stinking Fishermen here in London town are to
be found among the crowds who rush
the offices of the Agents-General when-
ever State pensions are being paid.
Hundreds of ex-public servants have
come to England to spend their savings
and their fat pensions, and there is
hardly a man among them who doesn’t
mutter Stinking Fish every time he
talks to anyone about Australia.
It makes one’s blood boil to see a
man draw twenty or thirty quid
at the end of the month for doing
nothing, and then turn round and
abuse the State that pays him the
money. Every pay-day means a
little Stinking Fish conference in
each Australian agency, and the
man who drifts in to inquire
whether Australia wouldn’t be
a good place to take his money
to, speedily floats out again
with a potion that he’d much
better invest his cash and his
brains and his bodily strength
and grit somewhere in Sheol.
The Governments affected
ought to lop off a year’s pension
rights for every Stinking Fish
groan, or, better still, stipulate
that pensions shall only be pay-
able in Australia, where they
ought to be spent, anyhow.
S.A. has not got the importing
craze nearly as badly as some other
States, which look on it as merely a
wheat-producing land. Among other
odd things, it is making fiddles and
cricket bats for itself, and tramears,
locomotives, and mining machinery
for its neighbors. And now one
big Adelaide firm has started to
make nails and barbed wire.
There appears to be a split, and a pretty
wide split too, in the happy family of the two ex-
half Premiers. Reid still calls himself a Free-
trader, and a sinker of the fiscal issue, and a man
who believes in leaving the tariff alone, save for
the removal of some small anomalies. McLean
recently stated at Sale that his half of the Anti-
Sosh multitude was going to make tariff revision
the first question of the new Parliament. There-
fore, if Anti-Sosh wins it appears probable that
its very first act will be to burst up on the tariff
issue, unless Reid turns Protectionist so as to keep
the menagerie together.
People who know what has happened,
and what might have happened, as regards
the suppression of Wren’s tote, now read in
the Melbourne dailies that the Victorian Govern-
ment sought advice from the Commissioner of
Police in the matter of its anti-Gambling Bill.
The reading of the letter of the Law is not a
policeman’s business. His action should be
directed always by the spirit of the Law, which
sanctions any sort of technical illegality in effect-
ing the Law’s purpose. Concerning the suppres-
sion of unlawful totes, all the O’Callaghan can
teach the Government is how not to do it, and all
that the Chief Secretary should have done with
him was to tell him to do it, without troubling
about minor consequences.
Chamberlain’s Tablets prove highly bene-
ficial in all liver troubles, entirely removing
biliousness; and in so doing will clear away all
skin eruptions, such as boils, pimples, and
eczema.*
“ STRAIGHT ” MEN.
He would rather take the verdict of a jury of 12 women
than of 12 men upon any subject in which the character
of a party had to be scrutinised and analysed. (Applause.)
This was’how he reasoned. They could bring no greater
knowledge to political questions—they could not bring
less—but they would bring a knowledge which would
enable them to determine whether a man was “ straight.”
(Applause.)— Bruck Smith.
“Ah, there’s that clear unselfish Mr. Smith. I
shall certainly vote for the Labor party now,
if it is only to obliye him.”
After all the assurances of the importers’
party that Trusts are the natural outcome of Pro-
tection, the present row about the great Soap
Trust of Freetrade England has some points of
interest. The first act of the Trust, by the way,
was to reduce the pound of soap to 15oz. That is
the sort of happening which shows Australia the
advantages of Bill Lyne’s Commerce Act. In
Australia now lib. has to be 16oz. or Bill Lyne’s
Act will ask the reason why.
The objections of the London Chamber of
Commerce to the Federal Commerce Act repre-
sent, in the main, the echo of Australia’s own
Stinking Fish party. There is nothing in the
Commerce Act which exacts from the merchant
anything more than bare.honesty, and the London
Chamber of Commerce is not so foolish as to pub-
licly protest against honesty, or to allege that it
can’t carry on its business on honest lines. But
it has clearly taken its view's of the Act from the
misrepresentations of our Foreign-trade liars.
Senator Walker, of N.S.W., in conversa-
tion with a S.M. Herald reporter, does not think
the balance of power in the Senate will be much
disturbed by the elections, and with a bright sec-
tarian eye beaming on the future, thus spots
certain eventualities: —
Messrs. Fraser and M'Coll will get the Orange vote,
with Mr. Ramsay, while Mr. Skene will probably get the
Roman Catholic vote, which should put him in.
It seems a pity that there isn’t £25 fine for even
mentioning the Orange vote or the R.C. vote, or
any sectarian vote. Many a thing dies out
through not being mentioned.
“ H.” writes :
Premier Bent, of Victoria, is still a land-boomer at
heart, and now that he is not booming on his own, he is
working out some schemes on behalf of the State. His
Elwood tramway, constructed to tap a neglected area
only four miles from Melbourne, where the Government
has just filled in an immense swamp, was the first of his
devices. Another is the sale of the Kew Asylum grounds
for building allotments ; a third is a proposal to lease the
Flinders-street frontage of Princes Bridge station for
shops ; and lie has just put forward a fourth proposal, to
run an electric tram along Alexandra Avenue, on the
south bank of the Yarra, in order to bump up the values
of several big blocks of State land in South Yarra. Barring
the sale of Kew Asylum grounds, which should be reserved
as a park, these schemes all promise to pay well. In fact,
Bent seems to boom better for the State than he ever
boomed for himself.
Queensland Assembly, in a foolish mood,
has rejected by 23 to 14 Lesina’s motion for the
abolition of the Upper House. It even rejected
a proposal to take a referendum on the subject.
If only one State would abolish its Upper House
by way of example Australia would soon realise
the uselessness of the old excrescence, and either
Queensland or N.S.W. should lead the way in
this matter. They are the two States with
nominee Councils, consequently the two in which
abolition is easy. It only requires the appoint-
ment of a sufficient number of new nominees
pledged to vote for the Council Abolition Bill, and
the thing is done. Victoria would probably have
to tack on to its Council Abolition Bill a clause
giving the abolished M.’sL.C. £lOOO a year each
for life before it could shunt its heavy incubus.
A cry from the gallery ;
While there are seldom any lively scenes, or bad lan-
guage, or stoush in the Vic. Assembly, it is probably the
worst-mannered Legislature in all Australia. Members
attend fairly well, but not the slightest pretence is made
of paying attention to the man who is addressing the
House, or to the Speaker or the Chairman. Members
sprawl on the benches in groups, yarning in ordinary
conversational tones until the buzz sounds exactly like
the rush and murmur of the Roman populace in “The
Sign of the Cross.” In order that Hansard may catch
something of what is going on, the reporters
have been admitted to the floor of the Chamber,
and sit alongside the Leader of the Opposition ; and
even from that place they are unable to hear well.
Further, small trumpery rows, not worth reporting in
the daily press, are almost continuous. Members yap at
one another like dingoes, and then, after a long wrangle,
in which half-a-dozen puerile insults are bandied about,
they withdraw. The whole trouble dates from the day
when Bent made the Speakership and Chairmanship of
Committees party appointments, for the first time in the
history of the Parliament. Madden makes a fairly strong
but strongly unfair Speaker, always upholding Bent
and Bent’s side. Craven, the Chairman of Committees,
is appalling in his weakness and his irresolution.
He notices what he shouldn’t, and takes no notice of
what he should. The Vic. Assembly can scarcely be
called a bear garden. It is a bear, but no garden. Also
the bear seems to have been drinking with other bears in
a threepenny bar.
Herbert Easton, who came to N.S. Wales
with a project for bringing good-class British
farmers to this State, is rapidly finding out that
the professed desire of the State Government for
agricultural immigration is just bluff. There isn’t
land available for our own agriculturists, let alone
immigrants ; and the Government will take no
steps to make land available.
The denunciation of Labor members of
Parliament because they are subject to a particu-
lar pledge comes strangely from newspapers that
support churches, the ministers of which are all
subject to a particular pledge. The army and
navy are subject to a particular pledge, and it
is hardly possible to be a married newspaper
editor without surrendering one’s independ-
ence and becoming a bondman. Most of
these editors are pledged twice over—to
be faithful to Mrs. Editor and to stick to
the policy of the paper.
Joe Carruthers, of N.S.W., after he and
his Parliament have blocked the settlement of the
Australian capital for over two years, has the
gall to issue another long letter asking Prime
Minister Deakin why the blessed site isn’t
selected. It is selected, as it happens, hut
Joseph always ignores that fact. Joseph also
thinks that the neglect of the Australian Parlia-
ment to fix a matter which it has fixed already is
“a very poor return ” for his “ courtesy ’’—which
is an especially beautiful remark. Joseph’s cour-
tesy all through the Australian capital contro-
versy has been barely equal to that of a drove of
pork.
When the Anti-Gambling Bill was before
Yic. Assembly last week Labor member Sangster
moved to authorise the Government to run annual
State lotteries in connection with the Melbourne
Cup. The Assembly had placidly recehed notice
that the totalisator would be asked for, but at this
suggestion it squealed. Mournful M'Cutcheon,
who generally looks like a petrified idol, was
startled into life. “Bless my soul, we’d all go
out at the next elections!” he gasped. Labor-
member Beard said the proposal was an atrocious
and oily defence of Sin. Beard’s wailing style
suggests that he preaches in his spare moments;
but even a preacher shouldn’t forget the bazaar
raffle.
Even the Dog Act! Says the repott of
the Municipal Conference in Melbourne :
Councillor Irving, for the Tam bo Shire, wished to mate
the enforcement of the Dog Act optional in country
shires, but was unsuccessful.
Is there any offence on earth, from dirtiness to
murder, which the Vic. Shire Council doesn’t
want to be “ optional ” in agricultural districts?
Victorian Gaming Bill promises to repeat
the experience of the N.S.W. Act. The Assembly
included racecourses in the places where
betting is prohibited. The Government re-
solved, however, to get that decision reversed.
The Bulletin doesn’t see why. If the
prohibition of betting on racecourses means the
destruction of horse-racing, that shows that horse-
racing is simply a means to gambling, and an
Anti-Gambling Bill, to be honest, should deal
with it accordingly.
England seems to have on hand a case on
all fours with that of Bertrand, who was so long
detained in N.S. Wales prisons. On July 28,
1906, John Lee completed 21£ years of penal

Attorney-General Davies (yic.) is a typical
family lawyer, and doesn’t believe that money,
once in the hands of the State, should ever
leave it unless it is counted out in pence.
His lean and famine-stricken character is ex-
emplified in his treatment of O’Halloran,
the genial Supreme Court prothonotary.
O’H., as deputy-registrar, did a good deal
of extra work for the High Court, and the
Commonwealth voted him a small sum. h> ut
Davies intercepted this, and refuses to disgorge,
notwithstanding that other State officers were
allowed, by their respective Ministers, to accept
payment for work done for the Commonwealth.
Davies’ view is that O’Halloran is his nigger, 311(1
if he hires out his nigger he —not the nigger-
should get the pay. In fact, if O’Halloran wro e
a poem in his own time, Davies would probably
collect the money, on the ground that his subor 1-
nate’s poem was his poem.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The first day of the V.R.C. Spring meeting
promises to be a day out for the favorites. If Solution
starts for the Melbourne Stakes she should win the 10
furlong: race, otherwise her Melbourne Cup backers will
look blue. The big colt Scobie is bound to be a popular
fancy for the Maribyrnong Plate, and, from this scribe’s
point of view, the rich stake is a pretty good thing for
that large and early youngster. As regards the Derby
there can be no doubt about Poseidon having a 4 to 1 on
chance, provided nothing has happened to spoil it since
the Caulfield meeting. Of the other Derby candidates
lolaire comes next to Poseidon on public “form,” and in
a truly run race the result will probably be Poseidon 1,
lolaire 2, Booran 8.
* * * *
And now the Cup. At time of writing, there
are two favorites, and, seeing that the average holiday
punter has no intention of backing both of them in con-
junction with one or two, or more, of the longer-priced
chances, he is just now looking for reasons why, of
two hot favorites, the one should be taken and
the other left. This scribe takes Poseidon as
against Solution for reasons which follow. When
the pair met at Rand wick in the Metropolitan Stakes, the
colt was receiving only 71b. from the mare, and although
he didn’t get near beating her, he was chasing her at the
finish—the only one of all fier pursuers that looked
capable of catching her if there had been another two fur-
longs to travel. In the Caulfield Cup, run over the same
distance as the Metropolitan, the colt had an advantage
of 261 b., and he never gave Solution a chance. His
weight was the same as before, within 21b., whereas
the mare carried 171 b. more, which extra burden seemed to
“ stop ” her as it would never have stopped a Wakeful, or
a Lord Cardigan, to quote only recent instances of first-
class animals that ran second in Cup races with more
than 9st. up. On her Caulfield Cup showing Solution
lacks the stamina necessary to win a Melbourne Cup.
The fact that she has won w.f.a. races over nine and ten
furlongs with 8.13 on her back is ho proof of her stamina,
and as for the newly-invented theory that a Caulfield
Cup is a more severe ordeal than a Melbourne Cup,
this scribe’s comment is “ Rats 1 ” All sorts of horses
have been brilliant up to 12 furlongs, but have failed
to maintain their excellence at the tail end of a longer
race. Going back to the relative “form” of Solution
and Poseidon in the Metropolitan Stakes, the position is
this: —Making a fair allowance for the improvement,
which the sturdy young three-year-old has made in com-
parison with the five-year old mare, who was the more
advanced in training six weeks ago, it may be argued
that Poseidon, on his Randwick running alone, should
beat Solution in the Melbourne Cup. He will carry 31b.
less, whilst she feels the burden of 21b. more. He has
lately performed splendidly, whereas the friends of
Solution have to excuse her very decided collapse at
Caulfield by saying that the weight stopped her.
The later owner of Solution stated prior to the
Caulfield Cup that the speedy mare couldn’t win with
9.6 up, but would prove a certainty for Melbourne Cup.
The horse-watchers and jockeys are largely in favor of
Solution. But none of these authorities on horse-racing
;an point to any direct evidence of the mare’s alleged
capacity to stay two miles at Melbourne Cup speed. For
shat matter, Poseidon may not be a genuine stayer.
All the same the indirect evidence is all in favor
Df Poseidon as against Solution. The mare’s way
3f winning races is not the way of the stayer. The colt
;hus far has never rushed to the front like Solution and
been collared at the finish. His way of winning is the
stayer's way, and this scribe will expect Poseidon to beat
Solution easily at a difference of 121 b. in the race of the
year. If it be a false expectation, it is at least more
defensible than the present worship of Solution by all
the “ clever ” people, many of whom appear to rate the
mare’s merits as a racer by the fact that Mr. Patjack
Wrenolds paid £4OOO for her, overlooking the previous
fact that Rupert Clarke was advised not to buy her at
the same price.

There are others. The field will be numerous,
and The Field is a good ’orse, as Christian Moses cheer-
fully remarks. Collectively, it is bound to be all right on
the day, whereas the two favorites may be stale, or lame,
or even dead and buried ere Tuesday. Of those that will
meet Poseidon on worse than w.f.a. terms—Dividend,
Lady Wallace, and Blue Spec—the oft-victorious Lady W.
would look dangerous but for her having shaped badly at
Randwick. She would need to be at her very best
to make a brave show against this season’s champion
3-year-old, and probably she is not at her best.
Blue Spec has won a Melb. Cup, and is, therefore, a most
respectable candidate, but, as compared with the Sydney
Cup winner, Noreen, Blue Spec is not an inviting chance.
Neither Little Toy, Proceed, nor Simoda look quite so
favorably handicapped as Noreen on her latest running.
The daughter of True Blue was fast enough to run third
for the Doncaster Handicap before winning her Sydney
Cup. She has done well this season, beating Dividend
over 2J miles, which was a better trial for the Cup than
was Solution’s defeat of the lanky black horse over nine
furlongs at Caulfield. The marketodds against Noreen are
stingy enough, considering the short price of the two
favorites, yet it might be advisable to back her before
the Melbourne Stakes, if she is to start in that trust-
worthy test race. Demas, another one with a consider-
able Cup chance, has to give Noreen 101 b., and, being a
good bit of stuff, he might manage to do it, but on this
point the racing next. Saturday may throw a light.
Meanwhile, Demas has a rather tempting appearance at
present odds. Judging them by their looks, one would
take Blue Spec, Demas, Ellis, Little Toy, Poseidon,
lolaire, Noreen, and Solution as a lot to beat the field in
this Gup race, whilst allowing outside chances to half-a-
dozen others. This rash prophet predicts a handsome
win for Poseidon, with Demas, Noreen, and Blue Spec
following the great colt home.

Pat Reynolds, posing as the purchaser of
Solution, is the joke of the period in Melbourne’s horsey
circles. It is alleged that, after Solution had won the
Caulfield Stakes, the mare’s new “ owner ” wore an air of
great happiness, and said “ the bist bit of luck I’ve had
for years 1 ” Another rumor states that Jack Wren
rushed to his apostle Reynolds to offer congratulations
on the victory. Waggish acquaintances of the “plucky
purchaser ” drop into his pub for the purpose of asking
him his latest opinion of the mare’s Cup prospects, and
the invariable answer is, “I’m in the hands of my min,
entoirely ” —Pat’s brogue being more Irish than his
humor. He takes the situation with a solemn seriousness.
“I’m told,” said one of his tormentors, “that Reynolds
paid £4OOO for Solution, and Wren ’olds the property,”
but divil a shmile of approval appeared on Patrick’s face.
* * * *
Solution, at time of writing, promises to be a
glaringly “sensational” horse for the Melbourne Cup.
The recent change of ownership, in consideration of
£4OOO, was a rather amazing circumstance. Then the
newspapers professed to be doubtful as to whether she
would start for the Caulfield Cup, so the subsequent
backing of the animal had a “sensational” appearance.
And now her defeat at Caulfield is made “ sensational ”
by the fact that “ Mr. P. H. Reynolds, the owner ”(! ! !)
has sent to Maoriland for a jockey to ride Solution in the
Melbourne Cup, because the riding of the other jockey
was considered injudicious. If the mare scores a runaway
victory in the Melbourne Stakes, on Saturday, the agony
of sensationalism will be further piled up.

Melb. Akgus played right into the hands of the
Judkins Brotherhood with a lurid article on “ Thieves at
Caulfield.” The Flat at Caulfield, as depicted by the
Argus scribe, was such a scene of the gambling evil that
Judkins, in all his fury, couldn’t overstate “ the need for
drastic legislation.” The mob cried aloud for one of the
welshers to be kicked and choked. Criminals of the
deepest dye were as plentiful as pebbles on a sea-beach.
And, having made out this catalogue of horrors, the
writer went on to say that “ under the existing laws the
police are powerless,” which is calculated to make even
Judkins laugh. The police are just as powerless or as
powerful as they want to be.

Those fatuous punters who patronise Wren’s
pony meetings in Melbourne are not talking so much
about the “improved management” of the “sport."
The other Monday the principal race at the Ascot meet-
ing was declared null and void by Wren’s stewards after
it had been won by an outsider under remarkable start-
ing conditions. This animal (Horseshoe) was so un-
manageable in the first instance that the starter ordered
him to be put back 50yds. and brought along to the
barrier at a trot. When Horseshoe had trotted to within
a few yards of the barrier, it was raised and the ten com-
petitors went away, with Horseshoe in front. He won
the race amid a storm of hoots, whereupon the stewards
declared that the start had been unfair, and all bets
were “ off.” HaU-an-hour later the race was run again,
five of the original ten starters, including the winner,
being withdrawn from the field. This time an un-
fancied gelding from Sydney did the trick. Wren’s
meetings are said, rightly or wrongly, to be pretty much
in the nature of one-man shows. The gees, according to
caustic commentators, are largely controlled by Wren,
and the “books” mostly represent that ruling power.
As to Wren being the sole lessee and manager of these
pony courses, the fact is admitted, and he openly glories
in it. Punters must form their own conclusions re the
probability of tote-owner, bookmaker, racecourse-owner
Wren being also financially interested in many of the
precious ponies which perform at his meetings.

At Caulfield there were most of the ingredients
for a repetition of the Flemington tragedy that ended in
McLeod’s death. The V.A.T.O. has control of the whole
Caulfield course, but apparently it was too lazy or careless
to keep out the balancer and the welcher. Even after
they were escorted off the Flat—to save their skins— one
or two had the amazing effrontery to pay their way
“inside ” with their “balanced ” money, and repeat their
old thieving game.

Bent’s Government has entirely given away the
case which the opponents of the totalisator in Victoria
have hitherto raised against its adoption—or at least that
section of its opponents which follows the monkey-shaved
men in white chokers who state their opinions in pulpits.
An equally active opposition has always come from book-
makers, but it has been the parsons whom the opponents
of the totalisator ostensibly obeyed. The Bulletin has,
during all the years of its existence, pointed out many
respects in which the betting-machine is to be preferred to
the gentleman with the bag. In the vast majority of cases,
the machine offers the public better odds for its money. It
is not liable to disappear over a fence when the favorite
wins. It does not roar in a loud and horrible voice and
fill railway carriages with cigar smoke and an irritating
accent. It does not mutilate language by calling Poseidon
“Possydon.” Neither does it offer to pay jockeys for
running anywhere except past the winning-post. It does
not waste its substance (torn unfairly from the public
pocket) on buying villas for ladies with hay-colored hair
and velvet dresses. It bets modestly and quietly, and
only with the people who deliberately decide that they
want to bet withit. Moreover, the extraction of apercentage
of its revenues would provide the Government with money
whiehcan be usedformanylaudableobjects—thereduction
of the Public Debt, for instance. Against these (and other)
merits, the Monkey-shave fraternity and those politicians
who kow-tow to it, have always set two yells :
(1) That no Government should dare to legalise the
Sinful and Pernicious Vice of Gambling.
(2) That no community should consent to help its
revenues out of such a Tainted Source.
Both of those yells have been flouted by the Bent
Government. It has proposed, in its Gaming Bill, two
new provisions. One is, that no matter what drastic
measures are taken to suppress betting anywhere else,
betting on racecourses shall be legal, by statutory
sanction. The other is, that the State shall exact a
charity tax, varying from 3 to 5 per cent., on the gross
revenues of every registered racing club. Thus, Bent
proposes to do both the sinful things against which the
parsons have always screamed. The only logical corollary
is the Government-controlled totalisator. Otherwise,
the Victorian Government will be in the foolish position
of having forsaken the path of holiness purely in the in-
terests of the quite undeserving class called bookmakers.

N.S.W. Gambling Suppression Act has closed
a well-known Newtown betting shop, familiarly known as
“ The Flea and the Bug.”
* * * *
Sydney’s betting clubs are closing up, and
within a month or so Wade’s Act should have swept them
all away. Most of these clubs were merely associations
run by bookmakers to disguise the fact that their
premises were betting-shops. For a few weeks after the
passing of the Act they were kept alive as “social clubs ”
in the hope that some means might be discovered of
driving a mob of racehorses through the Act. But the
Act continues to show a comparatively smooth surface.
It has done what it was primarily intended to do—wiped
out street and shop betting of the casual sort, and forced
all casual bettors to pay toll to the race clubs. Most of the
bookmakers who ran these clubs are still doing business
through the post. They act as “ commission agents,”
and their clients enclose money with a request that they
will attend the course and get the best price available on
so-and-so for the Melbourne Cup. Sometimes they specify
a price below which no business will be done. As
Gregory Wade has no control over the post-office, his Act
is powerless against this device. But it must not be
forgotten that the Federal Governmen' has the power to
place any bookmaker on the list of people to whom
letters will not be delivered if it finds that he is using the
post-office as a means to carry on a gamble.
* * * #
Clause 20 of Wade’s (N.S.W.) Gaming and
Betting Act reads: “ Betting or wagering on any
ground, not being a licensed racecourse, is pro-
hibited.” Any person acting in contravention of
that section is rendered liable by the next section
to be flung out, and if he persists in flinging him-
self in again, he can be run in and fined any sum not
exceeding £EO. The apparent meaning of this is that
betting can be indulged in on any sport carried out on a
licensed racecourse. It seems that it is quite possible to
hold every sort of sports meeting, from a church bazaar
to a dog-fight, on a licensed racecourse, and gamble on
it till the cows return to their domicile. The only possi-
ble fly in the ointment is that in the definitions a “race-
course ” means land used for race meetings, and to which
admission is granted by payment of money, by ticket, or
otherwise ; and a hostile Bench might possibly rule that
when a licensed racecourse is used for purposes other
than horse or pony racing, it ceases to be a racecourse,
and becomes a common place within the meaning of the
Act, with all a common place’s penalties attached.

Sydney First Grade cricket saw only one cen-
tury mad; on Saturday last, and yet it was an afternoon
DAVE BILLINGTON, the boss British swimmer,
who is visiting Australia at the end of the year.
when they should have been thick as blackberries in
Bulli. It was made by D. G. Eeid, of Burwood, against
North Sydney ; the anti-Soshite’a namesake had scored
107, when M'Phillamy sent him one which Eeid lifted
to Johnson, who held it. The next best score was
that of Poster, of Itedfern, who smote 70 before Eobson
got his wicket. Among the bowlers the most successful
was Fisher, of University, who bagged two wickets for
one run. E. Minnett and Allen, of the same club, took
three for 16 and two for 16 respectively. Norris, of
Sydney, bagged three of Central Cumberland’s wickets
for nine runs ; Bowden, of Glebe, smashed up
nine of Paddington’s for 62. Eobson, of Balmain,
got four of Eedfern’s for 38. After that, the figures fell ;
Black, of Gordon, taking three of Waverley’s for 36, and
JVUCartney, of the same crowd, getting away with five for
95. Of the rest, the less said the better. So far, Sydney
first grade competition is divided into three groups. In
the first, North Sydney, Paddington, Central Cumber-
land, and Gordon are level with four competition points
each. Then come Balmain, Burwood, Waverley, and
University—all level with no points each. The third
group consists of Glebe, Eedfern, Middle Harbor, and
Sydney. Of these the first three are level, each with four
less than nothing, while Sydney is a whole five below zero.

Sydney Referee recently published a detailed
list of M. A. Noble’s performances since 1894. Mary Ann
reached his zenith in the ’9B-’99 season, when, out of six
innings, he carried his bat four times, made 546 aggre-
gate, with an average of 273. This was one of those very
rare cases in which the average per wicket exceeded
the highest score, which was 267. A most remarkable
performance.
•» * i *
M. A. Noble showed a flash of the old heroic
Mary Ann on Saturday, in the match with Glebe, which
was defeated by Mary, and Mary alone. Glebe’s first
innings had yielded 186, and things looked blue for Pad-
dington. Six batsmen, including the mighty Trumper,
had gone, leaving only 33 on the board. Noble, going in
to stem the rot, found himself opposite M‘Cloy. who was
regarded as callow. But he played a wo' derfully safe
game, and Noble settled down to tire out the bowling.
The score crept gradually upwards, and before Bowden
managed to bowl M’Cloy 110 had been added to the 33.
When the last wicket fell Noble carried i is bat with just
and proper pride; Paddington had w'on by four runs.
The callow youth had made 62, and the great captain
himself had put on 56. A fine performance, and one that
made the onlookers inclined to forgive all Noble’s recent
vagaries.

The first round of Melbourne cricket {each
round takes but two Saturdays now) left four first-grade
teams —East, Saints, ’Boy and ’Varsity—with a win on
the first innings. But as Hawksburn, last season’s pre-
miers, had a clear win over ’Wood, it has three points as
against the others’ two. North and South, which drew,
score a point each. The only century was that of Car-
keek, of Hawksburn, 101. This strenuous person’s wicket-
keeping improves, and his fine batting make him a
good possible for the next Australian XI.
* * * *
S.A. Cricket Association has invented a kind of
sliding-scale to apply to drawn club games. A batting
side that is within 30 runs of winning at the call of time
can take one point, if it has five wickets in hand ; or, if
it is 90 runs to get, with three men to go, it loses a point.
(A full win counts three points.) Anything less decisive
than that is not to count at all.

The Dunlop Thousand Mile Automobile Re-
liability Test, to be run off in Victoria this month, will
see quite a number of multi-cylinder cars competing. The
day of the single cylinder engine, either on land or water,
is over, except for small runabouts, and family launches
for pottering about the back creeks. Next month will
see the first"of the new Van Aulcen engines—unless it
happened to be on board the Haversham Grange that got
burned on the way from New York. It is a 12h.p., and
will be fitted by Eelph, sen., into his new 25ft. launch, and
is expected to develop a speed of about 16 miles an hour.
The curious feature of the Van Auken engine is that the
explosion takes place between two piston heads, which
makes it possible to fit the smallest boats with twin screws.
Gorrick, who imported the Standard 111., which became
the Lady Eileen when Dr. Piers Hatton bought it, has
imported another Standard engine, to be fitted in a
boat which is to make 23 miles an hour. A 50 h.-p.
Mercedes, ordered by Whatmore, will be driving some-
thing at a high rate across Sydney harbor by the end of
the present season. The Invincible is for sale. Charles
Eelph having gone in for the building of motor engines
of any sort and every sort, on a large scale, has decided
that, for him, the green boat is obsolete, and his next
venture is to make 33 miles an hour. Anybody with a
trifle of £B5O about him can have the present Austra-
lasian champion.
* • • •
So far there is much talk but nothing definite
about that motor boat reliability test. The original
movers in the affair were the agents for an American
firm whose engines were, at the time, the boss ones on
Port Jackson, if not in all Australia. Then came the
upheaval of the Invincible, and whispers of a couple of
German engines which would run the Australian engine
very close indeed, and interest in promoting a combined
reliability and speed contest suddenly waned. There are
indications that, unless the Club takes the matter up and
pushes it to a conclusion, the affair will be quietly
dropped overboard.
* * k •
It was Mr. Whatmore’s day out at the motor-
boat race at Manly. Only three started, Baby De Dion,
Minumin, and Invincible. The Baby De Dion has been
improved a lot lately, and ran Saturday’s race with a new
propeller of local design, that of Mr. Sandeman, which
had the effect of adding another couple of miles per hour
to the speed. The course was four times round a triangle,
making a distance of seven miles. Whatmore started with
a handicap of 9min. 40sec., and covered the distance in
30min. 50sec. Invincible, starting from scratch, covered
the distance in 23min. 45see. It wasn’t so much the han-
dicap as the rudder that beat the Invincible—the constant
turning reduced the champion boat’s average speed from
22A miles an hour to a shade less than 18. There were
brief runs in which she showed full speed, and was well
w-orth watching. Whatmore’s handling of the Baby Be
Dion was excellent. It is the tiniest boat imaginable, and
when rushing along at full speed is quite invisible from
any distance. Only Whatmore’s spra3'-drenched head
glares out of the foam momentarily, and then disappears
in sheen and swirl.

Ex-world’s-champion sculler Stanbury left for
Maoriland on Saturday, He goes to measure his skill
and strength with Webb, of Wanganui.
Sydney Flying Squadron had great sport on
Port Jackson on Saturday last. A gentle nor’-easter and
a blue, unclouded sky brought 19 to the starting line,
and the handicap w'as run off in two heats and a final.
No less than three new boats made their first appearance
under racing pennants. Two of them were put out of the
race by the tug Stormcock ploughing through the flotilla
with a beastly ship in tow', and the other filled up and
narrowly escaped a capsize. Christian Webb, in the Aus-
tralian, showed some dainty navigation in the first heat,
but was hard pressed right through by his rival, George
Holmes, in the Donnelly. The second heat was not
nearly so exciting, the Stella leading from start to finish.
The real tussle was in the final, when Webb and
Holmes met again. Webb went on a different tack,
and when the two sections met off Bradley’s Head the
Donnelly was leading by half a minute. Then Skipper
Abbott in the Vision fell upon Donnelly, and while
Holmes manoeuvred with him the Australian got clear
away, and rushed off in pursuit of the Merlin and Stella,
which Webb headed on the next tack. When the bal-
looners billowed out the Australian went away with a
rush. Behind, Holmes and the rest crowded on every-
thing in the way of extras, and the water was hidden
under a cloud of ballooners, spinnakers and ring-tails.
And that was the last the fleet saw of the Australian,
which finished nearly a minute and a half to the good,
with the Stella and Vision second and third. It was the
best display of canvas seen this season, and the boats
were splendidly handled.
* * * *
Lane Cove, always beautiful, was more lovely
than usual on Saturday afternoon, when St. Ignatius
College held its 12th annual regatta thereon. Four open
races and five for College crews made up the programme.
The most interesting tussles were the Maiden Fours and
the Riverview Challenge Gold Cup. In the first-named
the University went to the front right away, and made
the pace hot all the time. Mercantile and Balmain put
up a tremendous struggle for second place, and Glebe
and two College crews dropped out. Mercantile managed
to beat Balmain for second place after a strenuous
struggle. Ouly three competed for the Riverview Gold
Challenge Cup, Sydney boat getting away first. But
Mercantile swung past, and Leichhardt hooked on to
Sydney’s stern. Later on Sydney and Leichhardt fouled,
and gave Mercantile quite a long start. Struggling free,
Sydney went after the Mercs, in a frantic manner, and
both boats rolled heavily with excitement. Wide steering
lost Mercs, much water, and a quarter of a mile from
home Sydney had drawn level. Also, the Mercs, were
dog-tired, and, failing to respond to the call for a final
effort, Sydney won by a length and a half. In the
Handicap Sculls, D. Green, of Enterprise, won by his
handicap—which was just plain beastly. Had he been a
motor-boat he would have been disqualified.

At Melbourne’s Henley -on - the - Yarra the
aquatic events were fought out in most cases, though
October is a bit previous for the best efforts of the crews.
Jack Fitzgerald, one-time top-notch sculler, and after-
wards pedal-pusher, returned to the game after a long
absence, but failed to get closer than a length to
Ballaratite Scott, though Fitz. was on even terms at
Engineer’s Corner. In the final, H. D. Brasch paddled
home in front of Scott—time, 7min. 41sec. over 1& miles
from bridge to bridge. Jim Donald stroked the Albert
Park eight lengths ahead of Mercs, in the Challenge
Cup in smin. 52sec. The heats of the Maiden Fours
and Eights provided the closest finishes during
the afternoon, Mercs, winning a great race in the
fourth heat of the Fours by a quarter length from Park.
’Varsity secured a win by some 6ft, in the second heat of
the Eights from Barvvon. The evening saw a youthful
canoeist drowned, and the Law was still dragging for the
body when the drunks’ train left.

That placid little fighting machine, Lyn Trus-
cott, scored another win at Melbourne Cyclorama the
other night, when he encountered Jack Cullen, one of a
well-known local fighting family, who has returned after
a fairly prosperous career in the West. Cullen had the
advantage in height and weight, but came into the ring
looking far from fit. In fact, he was carrying quite a
prominent bulge in front of him, and that little parcel of
fat told on him after ten minutes’ fighting. He took a
good hiding very cheerfully, and came up smiling for
more. Truscott could hit him pretty well as he pleased,
but he couldn’t knock the smile off his beaming counte-
nance. However, the eighth round used up the last bit of
energy Cullen had left, and he signalled defeat by walking
over and cordially shaking hands with the enemjv

Messrs. Murphy and Jessop gave an interesting
display of boxing at Sydney Gaiety Club, on Saturday
night last. Or rather Mr. Murphy gave the exhibition,
and Mr. Jessop was exhibited. Jessop had as much
chance with Murphy as he would have had with the auto-
matic boxing man, and that cheerful bruiser biffed Jessop
just whenever he liked. When Jessop strove to make some
recompense for the lavish attention he was receiving,
Mr. Murphy side-stepped, ducked, and pointed in a
manner that was artistic and effective. But it was merely
an artistic display—there was nothing rude or violent
about it, and, after the limit was passed, the referee
bowed pleasantly and politely opined that Mr. Murphy had
won. So did everybody else, and all was peace, content-
ment, and brotherly love.

The coursing men are a curious crowd of
humbugs. While”they revel in the torture of hares, they
are much concerned about the discomforts endured by
their dogs while being entrained from one scene of
torture to another, and have recently been worrying the
Railway Commissioners of N. S. W. to provide more
luxurious apartments for the hounds. But perhaps it is
not the comfort of the dogs that is troubling them, but
anxiety to have them arrive at the coursing ground as fit
as possible, in order that they may win more shekels for
their degenerate owners.

Amateur cycling racing, one time a very healthy
animal, has gone to pot in Maoriland, and sports pro-
moters now refuse to take cognisance of its existence.
The League of Wheelmen is chattering in a feeble way of
“ reviving ” this branch of the game, but as it has been
going down hill for years it has probably reached the
bottom by this time.

CIRCULAR QUAY, SYDNEY. Tel. 1760.
Last week a big notice decorated the office
of the Watchman (Sydney)—“ The Woman of
Babylon has arrived.” Even if The Bulletin
knew that kind of woman had arrived, it wouldn’t
advertise the fact. Why will religious papers do
such things?
Another instance of King Edward's kind
thoughtfulness was cabled last week. The royal
motor-car, with His Majesty on the back seat,
ran over an elderly man at liyde Park corner.
The King ordered the poor old chap to be taken
to a hospital, and followed him there, “ remaining
in attendance until he was assured that the
sufferer’s injuries were not very serious.” Quite
as much anxiety as that is shown by any decent
citizen who commits a motor accident, but it
reads like an act of uncommon goodness on the
King’s part. A monarch, in fact, can’t express
his solicitude for any unfortunate person without
graciously condescending to do it. Circumstances
prevent him from standing up like a man to feel
sorry.
Positive proof of Premier Bent’s scholastic
attainments has come to light in an old copy of
“ Captain Cook’s Voyages,” inscribed on the fly-
leaf “Thos. Bent, a gift from Mr. Penny, East
Brighton, schoolmaster, April 26th, 1852.” This
explains why paterfamilias Bent, the original
market gardener, used to push rebellious Tommy
to school bound in a wheelbarrow. The old man
knew that his offspring was worth the shoving
along.
Victorian M.L.A. Billson told a Melbourne
meeting the other night:—
One of the strongest Freetrade Labor members of the
Federal Parliament had told him that he would vote for
a highly Protective tariff if it were definitely laid down
that employees were to be guaranteed fair wages and
working hours.
Altogether, the Freetrade Laborite is such a poor
little remnant now, and is so anxious to give up
being a remnant and become part of a live Pro-
tectionist party, that it’s marvellous that the
Labor party should still “sink the fiscal issue.”
It is reported by the secretary of the
Melbourne Bread-Carters’ Union that one master
baker, who employed a boy 10 hours a day for Bs.
fid. a week, and worked a man 156 hours above
statutory time in one month, wore a medallion
branded D.C. on his Coat. And D.C. was meant
for Disciple of Christ ! A Brunswick baker sent
out a son (10 years) and a daughter (12 years) in
charge of delivery carts. One in Fitzroy sent his
daughter out with the cart, and gave her the baby
to mind as well as the bread.

D" Morse's „ O oT
pills.
OMEN OF THE HIGHEST TYPE, women of superior education and refinement whose sane discernment and good judgment give weight and
force to their opinions, highly eulogise the wonderful corrective and curative properties of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Throughout
the many stages of Woman’s Life, from peevish girlhood, through the ordeals of Motherhood to the declining years, there is no safer or more
reliable Remedy.
Years ago, Pills were the medicine of the poor only. To-day the efficacy of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills to overcome the common ailments of
mankind, and to restore Health and Happiness to sick and ailing women, has convinced not only the working section of the population, but the wives and
daughters of the more wealthy, professional, and independent classes that
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
Are WOMAN’S BEST FRIEND, and are absolutely INDISPENSABLE TO EVERY LADY’S BOUDOIR.

Be Beautiful and
Preserve Your Beauty
IN the face of even the world’s most beautiful woman lie the elements of Repulsiveness. When the muscles
that underlie the scarf-skin become weakened —when the delicate network of nerve tissues lose their tone,
when the skin grows less elastic with the advancing years —then wrinkles and crows’ feet form as the first
visible sign of failing beauty. Sometimes there is a lessened production of fat, which in early youth kept the
skin well plumped out, and now permits it to fall in folds ; or it may be as one grows stouter that the skin
sags with its burden, again forming lines and furrows, and producing the Double Chin.
Massage is the proper treatment for these conditions. Practised on modern lines with a Skin Food
that nourishes and softens the skin it is a wonder worker in Beauty that knows no rival. At
The Valaze Massag'e Institutes,
IP;
7A
s'-
i m
/
274 COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE; 158 PITT STREET, SYDNEY;
all the exercises of Beauty Building which have won fame for the Complexion Specialists of Europe are daily practised under the personal supervision of
Mile. Helena Rubinstein. Here the ugly creeping wrinkles are kneaded away—the skin pores are renewed and cleansed—the languid muscles
sti’engthened —new vigor given to the nerve filaments—the hungry tissues filled and satisfied.
With the round of Social Gaiety that attends the Cup carnival women should steal a few hours from their pleasures and visit the Yalaze Massage
Institute for treatment. The sensation is exquisite—the very luxury of ease and comfort—and the woman rises from her Massage Chair fresh and buoyant
and blooming as a girl—the soft glow of perfect health on her cheeks. From 3s. 6d. per sitting.
Not only is ordinary Face Massage practised at the Yalaze Massage Institute, but
SERIOUS FACIAL BLEMISHES ARE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY TREATED
—such as Birth Marks, Moles, Disfiguring Growths, Red Noses, Double Chins, &c. The PERMANENT removal of Superfluous Hairs is undertaken
with unfailing success. All the latest devices as used in the European Complexion Institutes are employed with those modern methods Mile. Rubinstein
studied *so exhaustively when visiting Russia and Yienna lately.
Consultation costs nothing. Mile. Rubinstein may be seen daily, and advises clients on all complexion matters. Call and see her to-day.
VALAZE SKIN
FOOD.
Valaze—thatdainty Russian Skin
Food—stands unapproached as a
complexion beautifier. It feeds—
actually feeds —tjhe skin, nourishing
the myriad pores and renewing
their youthful activity. It is used
by thousands of women—and by
thousands of women is welcomed as
a toilet essential. It is quite harm-
less to the most sensativeskin—you
can use it on that of an infant with-
out the slightest injury. It is guar-
anteed not to encourage the growth
of hairs—absolutely guaranteed.
3s 6d and 6s jar (containing three
times as much); postage 6d.
RUSMO HAIR
KILLER.
A Russian preparation for the
home removal of superfluous hairs,
selected by Mile. Rubinstein after
much expense as the best —abso-
lutely the best —of its kind in
Europe. Will not harm the skin,
and removes superfluous hair within
three minutes of its application. A
trial is asked. ss; postage 3d.
Valaze BlacKhead &.
Open Pore Core.
Discovered and used in his
laboratory by Dr. Lykuski, the
famous Russian Complexion Speci-
alist, this remedy fills a want of
many Australian women. It cures
the most obstinate cases. Approved
by Medical Authorities. 2s 6d box ;
posted 3s.
VALAZE
HERBAL SOAP.
Compounded from almonds and
rare herbs this soap both cleanses
and nourishes the skin. It is very
economical in use, one cake lasting
three times as long as ordinary
complexion Soaps. Gives a velvet
softness to the skin, 2s cake ; posted
2s 2d.

VALAZE MASSAGE
ROLLERS.
These are dainty little devices for
bringing the benefits of self-massage
into the home. They increase
deficient circulation of the blood,
develop the muscles, stimulate the
weary nerves; remove wrinkles,
crowsfeet, and other facial disfigure-
ments. Like no other Rollers—
mind—their special features are
protected by patent. Full direc-
tions for use accompany these
rollers, and one set will last a life-
time. They work wonders, ward-
ing off wrinkles, filling out hollows,
and removing double chins. Equally
efficient in reducing or plumping
out the face. Sold—single, 8s 6d
each, full-size box; small set, 12s
6d ; large set of two, 18s 6d ; com-
plete set of three in case, 255. '


This, from Melbourne, shows how our
Japanese ally behaves when he starts toying with
the implements of civilisation :
Constable Gunter deposed that he saw Miyata riding- at
a furious rate along Beaconsfield-parade, on the wrong
side of the road, and called on the defendant to stop, but
after looking up, Miyata rode straight at the witness,
throwing him to the ground with force. In the fall his
helmet was smashed, his coat torn at the back, his legs
and arms were bruised, and he received a severe shaking.
He estimated the damage to his uniform at 435. 6d.
Miyata was riding at about 20 miles an hour.
This wild onset cost the giddy Miyata 58s. 6d.—
about as much, in proportion, as the Hussian war
cost his bolting fatherland.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
MEDICATOR.
ħ
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining- membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the.
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
ihe sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and sure? if so, try
our great remedy.

The “furnishedcottage,’'common at health
and holiday resorts, should, in the public interest,
be brought under a rigorous system of inspection.
When these temporary homes are in use they are
generally more crowded than ordinary dwellings;
a popular idea of pleasure is to get to a strange
place where there is no drainage and only a tank
water supply, and then do battle with beetles and
contingencies in a mere fraction of the usual space.
Very often the occupants are convalescents, sent to
the seaside or the mountains for recuperation-
packed together and undergoing the sardine
cure, so to speak. Rarely is there an attempt
at disinfection, or even effective cleaning, between
tenancies. Writer knows of an instance on the
Blue Mountains (N.S.W.) where a consumptive
died in a cottage on Monday morning, and that
night fresh tenants came to the place (the corpse
was got out in time, but it was a tight fit). _ Pre-
suming that the newcomers had the window-
shutting habit, or any throat or chest weakness,
a crop of phthisis would be almost certain.
The furnished cottage should be liable to inspec-
tion by a health officer as if it were a common
lodging house—which, to a great extent, it is ;
and thorough cleansing and disinfection should be
compulsory after the expiry of each tenancy.
LEMON WHISKY.
WHAT IS IT ?
♦
TIHE subject of this article, for several important reasons, should be given preference over
' ordinary whisky. It is less intoxicating, yet more satisfying, and is therefore destined to fill
a great want—a beverage suited to persons of temperate habits, yet not teetotallers—a
stimulant which strikes the happy medium between ardent spirits and the mawkish soft drink.
Lemon Whisky supplies this want; it is at once a stimulant, a luxury, a food, and a medicine. A
happy combination of all the qualities which are essential to an ideal beverage.
The ingredients used in this preparation, although simple and familiar to everybody, possess most
important medicinal qualities. It is not a mysterious chemical compound; it is simply a scientific
preparation of ripe lemons, pure whisky, and specially refined cane sugar. It is guaranteed to be
absolutely pure, containing no adulterants whatever.
We invite our readers to carefully note what medical authorities have to say about the ingredients
contained in this unique beverage ; the authorities quoted are the best known and the highest in the
world ; their opinions cannot be questioned.
LEMON JUICE.
Dr. Robert Farquharson, late lecturer on Materia Medica at St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School,
etc., in his work, “A Guide to Therapeutics,” p. p. 208-209, says :
“ Lemon juice has some important therapeutical properties unexplained by any action it possesses
over the healthy organism.
“There is no doubt that persons afflicted with chronic rheumatic pains may often derive benefit
from taking a tablespoonful of this agreeable remedy two or three times a day with their meals.
“The occurrence of scurvy on board ship is now looked upon as a clear indication that the regu-
lar administration of lime or lemon juice has been neglected, and that the crew has been attacked by
a painful and dangerous disease, the absolute preventability of which experience has amply confirmed.”
The same authority points out “ that citric acid, from which most of the so-called lemon prepara-
tions are compounded, is in no degree antiscorbutic.”
It will be interesting to here mention that, by an Act of the Brjtish Parliament, every ship
sailing from a British port must provide at least loz. per day of lemon or lime juice for every member
of the crew.
In the “Companion to the British Pharmacopoeia,” 1899 edition, p.p. 400, we find:—
“Lemon Juice—medicinal properties—refrigerant; when diluted, a particularly useful bever-
age in the prevention and treatment of scurvy ; relieves thirst in febrile and inflammatory affec-
tions. In acute rheumatism, 4to 1 pint daily.”
Dr. Heinman, speaking on this subject said : —“You cannot take too much lemon juice, the
natural salts of which act as a solvent on uric acid in the blood, the cause of so many painful
maladies.”
WHISKY.
We will now say something concerning the whisky contained in this preparation.
Dr. Robert Farquharson, while deprecating its excessive use, states: —“A moderate quantity
of alcohol stimulates the mental faculties, and is often beneficial to weakly persons by giving tone
to the digestive organs and aiding the due assimilation of food. It is of great service to dwellers in
large towns, and others whose mode of life involves much mental strain.”
In the “Companion to the British Pharmacopoeia,” 1899 edition, we read:—“Alcohol.—
Medical Properties: Internally a powerful diffusable stimulant, especially cardiac; mildly anti-
pyretic, diuretic, diaphoretic ; used in states of acute disease characterised by excessive debility,
as in typhoid, acute pneumonia, and influenza, in insomnia of old people ; as an aid to digestion,
more especially in the aged and feeble, and those exhausted by overwork.”
Dr. Robert Hutchinson, M.D., Edin., M.R.C.P., author of “The Principles of Food and
Dietetics,” says, pp. 324 :—“Alcohol must be regarded as a digestive stimulant ” ; pp. 323: “Diges-
tion is pot merely a chemical process ; the movements of the stomach walls play a large part in it
also, and here the action of alcohol, in dietetic doses at least, is entirely favorable, for ithas a won-
derful power of increasing the activity of the stomach peristalsis. Alcohol not merely increases the
stomach- movements ;it promotes very powerfully the secretion of gastric juice.” pp. 324 : “Alcohol
in dietetic doses, 30 to 40 grammes (about two tablespoonfuls), taken before or during meals, actually
shortens the time required for the digestion of a meal by half an hour. The net influence, then, of
moderate doses of alcohol upon stomach digestion, even in health, is favorable rather than the
reverse, while in some conditions of disease its power of exciting the movements of the walls of the
stomach, and promoting the flow of gastric juice renders it a valuable aid to the digestion of solid
food. The importance of these conclusions regarding the influence of alcohol upon digestion can
hardly be over-rated, for they explain much of the benefit often derived from the moderate use of
alcohol even in health, and still more in cases of disease.”
SUGAR.
To complete our description of Lemon Whisky, which contains a considerable proportion of sugar,
it will now be necessary to inquire what are the effects of sugar on the human system. In doing so,
we cannot do better than again refer to Dr. Robert Hutchinson’s work, treating of the nutritive value
of sugar. On pp. 271 we find it stated that “refined sugar is to be regarded as a practically pure
carbohydrate; that being so, its food value must be high, for every gramme of it will yield 4T
calories of energy.”
“It is'as a muscle food that sugar is of special importance. We have already learnt (pp. 38) that
carbohydrates are probably the chief source of muscular energy, and sugars, on account of the ease
and rapidity of their absorption, are better calculated to perform this function than any other
member of the carbohydrate group.” Dr. Hutchinson’S treatise on sugar is too lengthy to be fully
reproduced in the space at our command ; we will therefore condense some of his more important
statements, which are as follows :
“To Swiss guides and Arctic explorers, the value of saccharine has long been familiar.”
“ Sugar is given to blood horses in order for sustain them in the trials to which they are sub-
jected.”
“Sugar has a notable effect in lessening muscular fatigue.”
“Vaughn Harley found that if he took of sugar per diem, his power of doing work
was increased 61 to 76 per cent.”
“ Sugar is a specially valuable food for persons who have to perform a single muscular effort,
especially if they are obliged to do so in a state of exhaustion.”
“ Extensive experiments have been made in the German Army, and it was found that the men
who were given ten lumps of sugar per day in addition to ordinary rations, marched better and
suffered less from hunger and thirst than their fellows not so supplied. As a result of the experi-
ments, the surgeon in charge recommended that the sugar ration be increased to 60 grammes per
day.”
“ Certain rowing clubs in Holland found sugar to be a valuable food in training. The rowers
who used it always won, on account of their superior powers of endurance, and it seemed to counteract
the bad effect of an exclusively meat diet, so that the men did not become ‘ stale.’ ”
We do not think it necessary for our purpose to quote any further from the overwhelming mass
of evidence at our command to prove to the satisfaction of our readers the .great value of the ingre-
dients used in the manufacture of Lemon Whisky. We have quoted sufficiently to show that it is
entitled to first place in the category of alcoholic stimulants, and that it is beyond doubt over-
whelmingly superior to all other liquors.
It pleases the palate, aids digestion, cleanses the blood, quickens the circulation, creates energy,
and strengthens the powers of endurance.
These are not our own bald, unsupported assertions ; they are the teachings of our greatest
medical authorities, beyond whom there are none to refer to.
After a careful computation of the component parts, the quantity it would be advisable to take,
according to expressed medical opinions, would be 10 to 20oz. (half a pint to a pint) per day.
IT MAY BE TAKEN :
Plain, in a wine-glass, as you would take a liqueur. Diluted with cold water to taste. As a
summer drink. A wineglassful mixed with cold soda-water. A wineglassful mixed with a large glass
of cold water, with your meals. For a winter drink, mix with hot water. It is doubtful whether
there is any better cure for chills and colds than Lemon Whisky, if taken hot and strong on going to
bed. For a sore throat or a troublesome cough, a teaspoonful undiluted at frequent intervals will
give great relief.
Obtainable from all Hotelkeepers and Wine aijd Spirit Merchants throughout the Commonwealth.

Clements Tonic
Is recommended by a friend—Good effecfl

PERFECT RECOVERY.
(BY A LOCAL REPORTER.)
Mrs. Teresa Vaughan, of No. 39 Elizabeth-street, Camperdown, said :
“ The first sickness I ever had in my life came to me six years ago, and it was a very severe
illness, too.”
“ What was it ? ” asked the writer.
“It was an attack of typhoid that had laid me low, and I had taken a turn for the better and was
getting on fine when I made the mistake of leaving my bed too soon. A relapse was the consequence, '
and, of course, I hacl to take to my bed again. I believe I was worse then than before, for the pains
which came to my head were frightful. Those in the house told me that often I was quite delirious,
so that will give you an idea of how bad I was. Well, I had been losing and losing flesh till at last there
was no more to waste away, nothing being left of me but a portion of my former self. Everybody
who saw me thought that my case was hopeless, and I’m sure I thought so, too ; but the old saying
that ‘ while therein life there is hope ’ proved to be a true one in my case. It was when I was so ill
that I couldn’t possibly have been worse—Scarcely able to move myself, in fact, that a friend of mine,
a lady about seventy, told me what a grand thing Clements’ Tonic was, and that it would bo sinful
not to give it a trial. Well, what could I say? Nothing had done me any good so far, so could I
expect this one remaining remedy to benefit me? I asked myself. My friend’s persistent “Give it
a trial,” answered the question for me, so I sent for some Clements’ Tonic that day. I don’t suppose
you’ll believe this, but it is perfectly true, the very day 1 first took Clements’ Tonic the retching
stopped, and if that didn’t make me joyful nothing would. Oh ! I was so thankful, for I knew then
that so long as I persevered with Clements’ Tonic there was still a hope for me left. My friends were
almost spellbound with amazement, and when I told them that Clements’ Tonic had also created a
feeling of hunger within me they could hardly believe their ears, they said. But I had still more to
boast about, for this latest medicine of mine had brought me such general relief from pain, that it was
as much as I could do to realise that I was the same woman who so recently had endured such a great
amount of torture. My chest had been very badly affected with the weightiness that was almost un-
bearable, but in a week or two I was quite free from it.”
“ When you had taken some solid food what were your feelings like ? ”
“Well, at first, I did not feel too comfortable, but after a while, and by taking Clements’ Tonic
regularly, the overburdened sensations passed away, and eventually my stomach became so strong
that I could eat anything, and never have the least unpleasantness to contend with afterwards. Why,
the agony I used to endure from windy spasms was something terrible, but Clements’Tonic eradicated
them for good. Several times a day, too, I was subject to fits of uncontrollable giddiness—the room
seemed to be turning round and round, and then everything would go dark for a space ; but even to
this trouble Clements’ Tonic proved to me my staunch and only friend. My eyes used to feel much
larger than they should have been, soheavy, and so defective, in sight, too—and you only wanted to catch
a glimpse of the whiteness of my tongue to understand what a disordered state my internal organs were
in. And what a terrible taste I had in the mouth ! As though I had been drinking gall, even after I
had rinsed it out with vinegar and water, which I often did. But there, what a small matter
Clements’ Tonic made of these things, besides which it soothed me so well that I soon got a sound rest
every night without any of the fearful dreams that used to terrorise me. There is no doubt when I
first used Clements’Tonic I was as near the portals of death as I could be. I earnestly hope this
account of my recovery wdl come under the notice of delicate women, so please publish this in any
way you may think fit.”

“Robert Hap ” : When private enterprise gets
into the niake-u t - of “religion" and “philanthropy,” it
conducts itself in a disgustingly mean manner. Consider
the methods adopted by the Boss Sweater of the universe
in the conduct ot his business. In my town this cadging
Colossus runs, among other industries, a Christian eating
house and a toy factory. The tariff at the eating house
ranges from one shilling to a penny, or thereabouts. The
Colossus may pay a little for labor, but he pays mighty
little for vegetables. Two females belonging to his busi-
ness attend the vegetable market early every morning,
with corn sacks, and eg a few turnips, or an onion, or
anything that can be spared from the scanty purchases of
the widow or the wooden-armed man who runs a small
suburban greengrocery. (They don’t molest the raucous
voiced person in the Highly decorated cart, for various
reasons.) In the Great Sweater’s toy factory the work is
mostly done by discharged prisoners, and the toys are
fashioned from case wood cadged from the warehouses.
And this species of private enterprise demands just as
much for its goods as the other brand, which has to
observe certain labor conditions, and pay a standard
wage.

The State-managed cold storage system has
given a fillip to the poultry business in N.S. W. which it
never could have got had private enterprise retained con-
trol of the job. When the cold storage of eggs was
undertaken by the State the low price of 2d. a dozen for
six months was lixed upon. As a result there are at
present about 3,600,000 eggs in the Government store,
and private enterprise is rushing, in wild surprise, to
secure a share of the business that it once despised.
“ Yes, sir,” he said, switching a serviette over
his shoulder, and stopping close to the end of the table,
“ I do accept tips.” It was a slack half-hour, and the
clerical-looking personage was inclined to be communi-
cative. He seemed full of information, and a casual
question drew the cork. “ I bought my right to tips,
sir. Every Monday morning I hand in myp.n. From
that moment tips are mine. I settle up at the week’s
end, redeem the p. n. with my wages, if they reach so far,
and begin again. The amount of the p.n. differs. Holi-
day weeks, when the country flocks to town, are higher
than ordinary. Yes, it is about the same here as in Mel-
bourne—they average wonderfully close. Of course, it is
a speculation, and, like all speculations, subject to sur-
prises—both ways. Wouldn’t a fixed wage be better?
No, sir. The element of chance is a powerful brightener.
It turns a drudgery into an exciting game. No, sir.
Thank 3 ou, sir.”

“Cocky”: Does orcharding pay? Outsiders
have the vaguest ideas. A 20-acre orchard, with the
right position and the right trees, takes 12 years to be in
full bearing. The minimum cost in labor and capital to
that time is £lOO per acre, or £2OOO. Returns the
twelfth year are £5OO, exes. £2OO, leaving £3OO, or 15 per
cent, on invested capital. This is the normal result; but
occasionally—very occasionally—the value of a single
crop will equal entire cost of place. Yet Ido not know an
instance, out of hundreds, of an outsider going into the
orchard business with capital and not burn ng his fingers.
The successful are those brought up to fruit-growing, or
newchums with a little coin who learn the game gradually
and keep going with other work. The present prospects
of the County of Cumberland are excellent. Drought has
killed out the old and neglected orchards, which deserved
to be dead —they couldiVt be deader than they deserved—
and there are good prices in view.

Good old Private Enterprise again scores heavily
at the expense of the public, of bourse. Recently, a
Kurri Kurri baker ordered a truck of flour in Sydney.
The State railways carried the flour from Newtown to
West Maitland, a distance of 120 miles, for'£l Bs. 3d.
Then the East Greta Co’s, private railway took it on to
Stan ford-Merthyr, distance 0% miles, freight £1 12s. 9d.
In other words, Private Enterprise charged 4s. 6d. more
for carrying it 9J miles than the State did for carrying it
120. Private Enterprise is the sort of thing that some
people deserve to get for their sins.

Vic. Government Analyst Wilkinson showed that the
grocers who were selling certain patent medicines were
in reality passing off preparations- “ half as strong as
whisky,” but without a liquor license. The three varieties
of “medicine” all contained over 20‘7 per cent, of
alcohol, equal to 44'5 per cent, of proof spirit—that is,
they were about twice as strong as champagne. And one
of them was advertised as being specially suitable for
infants and invalids 1 One of the cases fell through for
the reason that the seller possessed a wine and spirit
license for his premises, but sold no “ liquor,” as he had
conscientious scruples. Still apparently the good man’s
scruples didn’t prevent him selling baby-medicine half as
strong as whisky. Scruples are strange, erratic assets
most times ; in a grocer’s shop they generally seem more
erratic than usual.

The Stinking Fish sentiment seems to be almost
as strong as ever where mineral waters are concerned.
Foreign brands of water are given credit for virtues they
don’t possess, whilst the exploiters of Australian mineral
springs find it difficult to get them about on their actual
merits. Considering that the Daylesford Hepburn (Vic.)
water has had a local reputation for 40 years or more,
the demand for it outside of the district is not nearly what
it ought to be. The co. that leases the spring, and
supplies the water in cylinders, has lately issued another
analysis from its Melbourne office, which latest analysis
shows an increased percentage of iron, magnesia, and
lithia—but the beneficent fluid is a mere Australian pro-
duct ; therefore, the average unpatriotic, dyspeptic fat-
man rarely thinks of drinking it for health purposes
unless a medical man practically pours it down his
t iroat, and the doctor, as a rule, is not an enthusiastic
Lv-racker for any bona-fide mineral water. It is notgood
for bis trade.
CREAM AND ROSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cream and Roses sitting there,
Tapping lightly on the keys.
With the sunlight in her hair,
Drives the office to despair.
(“ Got a minute, Miss, to spare?
Take this letter, please ! ")
Cream and Roses seems to know
Of our adoration wild.
(“ Did you say ‘ G. Brown and Co.
All your implements will go
Forward ?’ ”) Ah 1 dictation’s slow.
Glory 1 how she smiled !
Cream and Roses throned in state.
Tapping swiftly every key,
Seems a rather silly fate.
(“ Yours to hand —We beg to state.”)
So the blessed serfs dictate
To Her Majesty.

Premier Deakin made a telling point
against Wobbler Reid, at Ballarat. Deakin
explained the history of the Union Label. The
Trade Marks Bill, as drafted by the Protectionist
Government, contained no union-label provision.
The label idea was inserted by the Senate during
the Reid-M‘Lean period, and was modelled on
the American system. Reid didn’t denounce the
label, or abandon the Bill, or resign—he just
swallowed the thing whole. When the Deakin
Government returned to power it inherited the
Bill with Reid’s American label in it, and then
Reid started to curse it. Deakin shaped Reid’s
.American label into harmony with Australian
laws and sentiment, and Reid cursed louder than
ever, and has gone on cursing, although it is a
much milder kind of label than the American
contrivance, which he complacently swallowed.
Concluded Deakin, “If Reid comes to Ballarat
and endeavors to make you believe that the future
of society hung on the defeat of the union-label
clause, ask him *lf you thought Australia’s
destiny imperilled by this horrible proposal, why
didn’t you lay aside your Bill when the proposal
was much worse ? Or why didn’t you endure eight
or ten hours in the train to come to vote against
it in Parliament ?’ ” And that’s a good question
for Australia to ask Reid every time it gets a
chance.
At the Burnley (Lancashire, Eng.) police
court a woman who had summoned a lad for
assault was asked “Is he a relation of yours?”
“No, but he might be by the way he carries on,”
she replied.
The Victorian Anti-Gambling Bill ori-
ginally proposed to license all courses, and to
refuse to allow racing on any course under six
furlongs. No course within 20 miles of the Melb.
Post Office was to hold more than 16 meetings a
year. These clauses struck a mighty blow at
John Wren, who holds on Ascot and Richmond
at present 157 meetings a year, and makes £15,000
a year profit. Naturally John was alarmed at
the prospect of being reduced to 16 meetings a
year; but Bent has amended his proposal,
and Wren has amended his alarm. Bent now
intends to allow races on five-furlong courses
and to give the Fitzroy course 24 meetings a
year. Ascot 24, and Richmond 24. Thus, John
Wren, instead of being allowed to hold 32 pony
meetings each year, can hold 72. Flemington
and Caulfield only 16 meetings each.
Bent sprang this proposal on the Assembly, and
the Assembly literally gasped. Then Bent, in
excuse, blessed John Wren as a noble benefactor.

Suffered Untold Misery for Three
Years—Better in Two Months.
MARVELOUS CURE BY
CUTICURA REMEDIES
“My son, who is now twenty-two
years of age, when he was four months
old began to have eczema on his face,
spreading quite rapidly until he was
nearly covered. We had all the doctors
around us and some from larger places,
but no one helped him a particle.
The eczema w r as something terrible,
and the doctors said it was the worst
case they ever saw. At times his whole
body and face were covered, all but his
feet. I had to bandage his limbs and
arms; his scalp was just dreadful. I
used many kinds of patent medicines
before trying the Cuticura Remedies,
all to no avail.
“ A friend teased me to try Cuticura.
At last I consented, when my boy
was three years and four months
old, having had eczema all that time,
and suffering untold misery. I began to
use all three of the Cuticura Remedies;
the Cuticura Soap helped as well as
the Ointment. He was better in two
months; in six months he was well;
but I gave him the Cuticura Resolvent
one year, using twelve bottles, I
think, and always used the Cuticura
Soap for bathing, and do now a good
deal. He was four years old before
he was well, and his skin became per-
fectly fair when cured. I give you per-
mission to publish this letter for I am
always glad to do good when I can. I
think I have told you all there is neces-
sary to tell.” Mrs. R. L. Risley,

The “Western Wilderness” of Victoria.
Grant Hervey writes :
If a line were drawn from Werribee to Ballarat, thence
to Ararat, and onward to the South Australian border, it
would mark out one of the finest agricultural areas in the
Southern hemisphere. The rainfall varies from 20 to 40
inches, and the coast is dotted with seaports, though
certainly the latter look like second-hand Sodoms at
present. But their aspect of ruin is not an index to the
quality of the inland soil. It is merely a blazing indict-
ment of the blastiferous muddlers who have been allowed
to mismanage the State’s affairs. According to the latest
Victorian Year Book, the Western district contains
6,235,882 acres of alienated land, but only 219,346 acres
are cultivated; and 6,016,536 acres —or twenty-seven
twenty-eighths of the whole —are consecrated to sheep.
The Western district farmer is a scarce animal, and few
in a row.
As for the foreign farmer who wishes to take up
unalienated land in the Western District, his prospects
are as blue as the cows in an impressionist picture. This

These are the areas to which the Stout Person points with
fine scorn on the platform. “ Half a million acres waiting
to be taken up 1 ” he says, triumphantly. Then, while the
fool audience is stamping its feet and jabbing the floor
with its enthusiastic brolly, the Stout Candidate jumps
to another subject, and deftly avoids any remarks about
the quality of the said 442,137 acres.
As a matter of cold fact, only 2005 acres of first-class
land are available in the whole of the “Western wilder-
ness.” Yet this is the district in which 97 out of every
100 acres have never growm a solitary ear of wheat! But,
as the Government Statist indicates, even these two
thousand odd acres are only technically of the first
class. They are so heavily timbered that they may
practically be struck off the list, for it would
take half a farmer’s lifetime to clear the soil
properly. The second-class land chiefly consists of
granite ranges, and has mostly a grazing value. Some of
it is suitable for vineyards and orchards, but from the
wheat-grower’s standpoint its value is about nil. From
this division onw'ards, the quality of the available areas
becomes poorer and poorer. In Heytesbury there are
164,000 acres of third-class land available ; but there
happens to be a large and emphatic forest on top
of the farms which this area might otherwise make. The
74,708 acres in Normanby, and the 14,552 acres in Follett,
are also concealed beneath vast piles of timber. Thus, as
a matter of hard fact, there is scarcely one decent selec-
tion to be found in the whole western country. It is an
absolute certainty, anyway, that none of that unalienated
land is of much use ; because if it were any good the
squatters would have grabbed it years ago.
These figures show what sort of a prospect awaits the
man who thinks of taking up Crown land in Western
Victoria. Yet he very reasonably would turn to that
district, because it produced last year (as it usually pro-
duces) the best average by far of any wheat lands of
Victoria. In an ordinary season the "yield exceeds 15
bushels—when the squatter allows the land to yield any-
thing. Of course, if the man seeking such land does not
care about the unalienated areas, he can buy good land
from the kind, charitable squatter at anything between
£l5 and £4O per acre. The squatter himself may be in
Europe, taking it easy on the Kiviera, but his agent is
always on the spot, and willing to do business—at a
price. Altogether the “Western Wilderness,” so to
speak, is an oasis masquerading as a desert. And, until
Providence either invents a new kind of millionaire
farmer, who ploughs the soil for amusement, or the Aus-
tralian Parliament applies a devastating graduated land-
tax, the Western District is likely to remain a bogus
Sahara. Approximately, it is bisected by 450 miles of
railways, all subject to an iniquitous system of preferen-
tial rates, and on every mile of these railways the State
has to pay an interest bill of £426 7s. 6d. per annum.
On a rough calculation, the interest burden on
these railways totals £200,000 per year. Meantime the
entire land-tax paid by the Victorian squattocracy during
the past eight years, has averaged £lOO,OOO per annum—
of which less than half has been paid by the Stout Persons
who own the “ Western Wilderness.” Consequently, al-
though the value of the squatters’ land has been trebled
and quadrupled by the construction of the western lines,
the land-hog passes the bill along to the general public,
which pays like a lamb, and votes for the squatter with
religious regularity.
♦
There is tribulation amongst the squatters of
Vic. Western District just now over Bent’s pro-
posal to break up some of the large estates for
wheat-growing. Hampden Shire Council, which
consists mostly of Curries, Manifolds, and
Blacks, was for some time shouting wildly for a
railway across the plains, but it collapsed like a
punctured tyre at its last meeting, and decided to
“ take no further action ” in the matter, on the
ground that the affair “ had now assumed a politi-
cal aspect.” The only “aspect” it has assumed
is that, in place of the Government building the
line at once, and thus presenting the squatters
with at least £2 an acre increased value on their
huge holdings, Bent proposes to acquire the land
at its present value, and get the increment for the
country. Such an eminently fair proposal, how. i
ever, comes like a nightmare to the squatters* I
who have fleeced the country so long and so con-
sistently that they hr *'e forgotten what honesty
looks like. The priv.y"«al wail, so far, has been
put up by Thomas Sk V, of Wooriwyrite, near
Camperdown. Shaw has 30,000 acres of fair land,
all fit for cultivation, but which at present grows
only remarkably-undersized merino sheep. A
railway would mean a present of at least £OO,OOO
to Thomas Shaw, and Bent doesn’t see what
Shaw, has done to deserve the present.
Shaw’s wail is that, after he has reclaimed his
estate from the wilderness and the blacks,
it is an outrage, and also un-British, to take
it from him. The wail proceeds as if the Govern-
ment intended to shoot Thomas out on the main
road, after 24 hours’ notice, without any compen-
sation. No mention is made of the fact that he
got the land for next to nothing, and will receive
its full present value when it is taken. The most
interesting feature of Tom s complaint, however,
is what it doesn’t say. Four years ago, in a wild
epistle about anti-Sosh, Shaw said that, if the
Labor party didn’t keep quiet, or went any
further, he would pack up his duds and leave the
country. Since then the Labor party hasn’t
kept quiet, and has gone a lot further; but
Shaw is still holding on to his sheep-station,
and, for all his shouts about the insecurity of pro-
perty owing to Socialistic legislation, he says it is
an outrage for the Government to give him good
portable cash for his land, so that he can fly with
it to some safer country and be at rest.
Dr. Senn, of Chicago (U.S.A.), who has
been around the world observing, tells Chicago
Daily News
Australia, I think, takes the lead in medicine. It is
away ahead of the mother country, and has made more
progress in that department than any other of the British
colonies.
And yet quite a number of countries still refuse
to recognise Australian medical diplomas, and
Australia, instead of retaliating by making their
diplomas waste paper until they get into a more
reasonable frame of mind, takes the thing lying
down.

Beanie’s Bronchitis Cure.
THCE FAMOUS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief ; and to those who are subject to Colds on I lie Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs'’ have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BEIWA.RE OF COUGHS !
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.

CURES.
Bright’s Disease. —From Mr. William John Yuille, Harveytown, Eaglehawk,
Bendigo, Vic., Ist September, 1905.
“Despite all the skill and attention bestowed on me by the hospital doctors and nurses, I
gradually grew worse, the doctors having diagnosed my complaint as Bright’s Disease. The doctors
gave meup as incurable, and gave me but a few weeks longer to live. I was then taken from the
hospital to my home to die (as my friends thought), as my father did not wish me to die in the
hospital. But I had a feeling within myself that there was hope whilst there was life, and, unlike my
friends, I did not give up in despair. On the way home my father procured a bottle of Warner’s Safe
Cure, but, on arrival, I was in a state of collapse from the shaking 1 had undergone on the way. My
father, thinking that the Safe Cure would do me no harm if it did me no good, gave me a small dose,
continuing to do so at intervals throughout the day. I felt a little better, the agonising pain being
less severe. I continued to take Warner’s Safe Cure, and was soon able to get a little rest and sleep,
and my strength very gradually' returned. My friends began to have hopes of my ultimate
recovery. Each day investigation showed less albumen. My health steadily improved. Each
bottle of Warner’s Safe Cure I took hastened my recovery. I was then able to get up and about, and
in less than three months was restored to perfect health and strength. _ From that time up to the
present I have had no return of the disease, and for six years have been in constant employment on
the mines.”
Bladder Disease.—From Mr. F. H. White, 37 Errol-street, West Footscray, Vic.,
9th April, 1906.
“ About eight years ago, when living in Gippsland, I had occasion to do some heavy work on our
farm there, and brought on a disorder of the bladder, which caused me to suffer excruciating pain in
the bladder and other organs, especially in my side and back. A brick-dust like sediment pre-
cipitated in my water. At frequent intervals I suffered torture. The pain became so severe at last
that I was not able to get about. I tried a number of medicines with no effect until I commenced to
take a course of Warner’s Safe Cure. After taking one bottle of that medicine my condition was
much improved, and the pain less violent. Continuing to take the medicine, I gradually grew better,
and my urine became clear and free from deposits. All symptoms of my deplorable condition have
now ceased. I enjoy very good health and can honestly recommend Warner’s Safe Cure for bladder
troubles.”
Liver Disease. —From Mrs. Mary Maher, 18 Burrahpore-street, Sydney, N.S.W.,
17th March, 1906.
“For a number of years I have suffered from siek-headaches, indigestion, and biliousness. At
times I became quite dizzy and almost afraid to venture into the street. My blood was poor and
watery. I tried many medicines, hoping to get relief, but without success. 1 was nearly in despair
when, on the advice of a friend, I decided to give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial. After taking about two
bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure the headaches entirely left me, and in the course of a month I found a
wonderful improvement in my general health. I gained strength rapidly, and as my strength returned
the dizziness ceased to trouble me. I can now eat and sleep and attend to my household work with
ease and comfort.”
Rheumatism. —From Mrs. Mary Regelsford, 84 Gerard-street, Alexandria, N.S.W.,
26th October, 1905.
“ I was laid up with acute Rheumatism and Rheumatic Fever for eleven weeks, and for eight
weeks of that time I was quite a cripple, being unable to get about at all. I was treated by a Sydney
doctor, but after taking bis medicine only got relief for a little while. I then thought a change might
do me good, so I went away, and while away I got so bad that we called in another doctor. He pre-
scribed for me, but I only seemed to get temporary relief. I also tried many professed cures for Rheu-
matism, both internal and external, but could get no relief whatever. I was beginning to get very
down-hearted after trying so many medicines. Finally I made up my mind to take Warner’s Safe
Cure. Altogether I took seven bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure and one bottle of Warner’s Safe Rheu-
matic Cure. After taking the second bottle I began to feel a change, so I persevered with the treat-
ment and found that I was improving with every dose I took. The result was, that I was thoroughly
cured. I can honestly say that I feel like a new woman, being now able to attend to my household
duties, washing included. You are at liberty to use this letter as you like, so as to benefit others who
may suffer as I have.”

The glorious Hurrah ;
The World says, “ Take your task,”
Cjuite empty is the cask.

The World is grey and grim ;
The lights are burning dim ;
The cheers are faint and few —
And ghosts glide up the stairs
To fill the empty chairs.
Bohemia, adieu !
We owned some fine chateaux
Whereon, at even glow.
Red banners rose and fell
Upon the winds of Spain—
Would I were there again !
Bohemia, farewell !
Then, ev’ry golden morn
We heard a sudden horn
Taran-taran-tara !
It called to Fields of Fame
Where each would make a name—
Adieu, Bohemia !
What Pit has sucked them down,
Our dreams of fair renown,
And our ambitions high ?
They are as dead and gone
As ancient Babylon—
Bohemia, good-bye !
The man who was our Wit
Is mentally unfit
His business to pursue ;
Our chief Philosopher
With Philistines is square—
Bohemia, adieu !
Our Orator sublime,
That could to Heaven climb,

Bohemia, so-long !
A pleasant land I wis
Where no To-morrow is,
And towers touch the sky,
Is our Bohemian land,
Though coin comes slow to hand—
Bohemia, good-bye!
Closed is the tavern-door ;
The kingdom is no more—
The kingdom that I knew
When I was mad for Art,
And birds sang in my heart—

O purple-chaliced nights,
With all your dear delights,
Take back your visions-—Va !
The stars burn overhead,
Like candles round the dead,
Adieu, Bohemia !

Wild Honey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TO Jim Barren and “the Missus” she
was just Honey. But the drovers, and
the teamsters, and the travelling stockmen
knew well that the girl was wild honey; with the
harshness of red wattle-gum, and the sweet of its
bloom, and the quick, mischievous sting of a bee,
planted straightly. There was the clear purity of
the bush honey, too, in her eyes, where the boys
found it when they leaned over the bar to talk
with her ; to watch her clever little hands at the
taps and syphons, and to catch the demure eye-
blink, or the frank, red-lipped laughter.
Past the shanty the life of the great North-east
flowed down to the towns, and then back again ;
big slow-voiced men from the wool-country along
the Darling ; swaggies, tramping the eternal round
of stations and sheds; spielers, who seldom came
twice to Jim’s bar ; and drovers from Barcaldine
and the Mitchell, with the fire of the North in
their veins and their speech. And among these
men from the outermost corners of the Big Land,
Honey’s young life flowered into womanhood, un-
afraid and unsmirched.
Eighteen years back Jim had found her, a half-
naked baby, in the brigalow swamp past the dam,
and he carried her home to “the Missus” in
place of the dead child left at Walgett. And that
was Honey’s story so far as men knew it —until
Jack Hammond came down from the North.
He came as a thousand other drovers came,
through the blinding heat of a midsummer after-
noon, with the jangle of jack-shays and chains on
the packs, and the slurring beat of tired hoofs
down the road, and the gay, careless greeting to
the crowd loafing out on the verandah. In the
bar “the Missus” was serving eight teamsters,
with Andy Macandrew to help her ; and behind,
in the dim, close-shuttered parlor, Honey was
chaffing Red Morgan and Deane. “The Missus”
called the girl out sharply, for of all Honey’s
lovers Harry Deane was the fiercest, and the
hardest to keep in check. And Honey came,
with her light, slim child-figure, and her free
running step, and the tomboy toss of her pert
little head. Jos Kindred caught at her print
sleeve, drawing her back with a grin on his red,
jolly face.
Three-star fur me, Wild Honey,” he said.
“ An’ Geoff’s shoutin’.”
“He ain’t!” Geoff brought his handsome
bearded face close. “ Git the sting inter him' fur
that, Queen Bee. He’s owin’ me one from last
time. You remember ? ”
Honey took two glasses from Andy, and set
them on the bar.
“You can’t have me rememberin’ all the drovers
as goes up an’ down,” she said demurely. “Isees
so many—an’ forgets ’em all.”
“But yer ain’t forgot me, my Queen Bee?”
Honey swung back, looking at him, with her
small hands on her hips, and her little wicked
up-tilted smile.
“I hadn’t orter,” she said slowly, “seein’ as
wherever there’s a bee there’s a drone.” Then
she glanced up out of the volley of laughter
ringing round her, and held Jack Hammond’s
bold eyes with her own.
Jack was droving, like the rest; and browned
and broad, like the rest; and his long-limbed
supple strength was no more than the strength of
many who had passed .before. But the fire struck
fire at first glance, and in three days “the
Missus” knew, and told Jim.
“That Diamantina chap is arter our Honey,”
she said.
“ Sho,” said Jim, and scraped his pipe-bowl
with care. “Ef the gels down away south knew
how many chaps was arter our Honey they’d
wanter make her hair fly.”
“ But did yer ever see Honey takin’ it this way
afore? There’s suthin’ ter the little face o’ her,
Jim, what was in mine when you come courtin’
me.”
“Freckles?” asked Jim; then laughed and
coughed over his smoke when “the Missus”
banged the door with decision.
And up among the brigalows on the hill, with
the yellowtop rustling in the night-wind at her
feet, and the red shanty-light no more remem-
bered than one of the stars. Honey was listening
to the great Australian night that is filled with
sound, and to the whisper of Jack Hammond’s
voice at her knee.
He told her of the wild, free life Out-Back,
where Death and Danger reel hand-in-hand, with
Love and Laughter between. He told her of the
white-lipped mirage, and the fury of the gold-rush,
and the mad joy of a cattle-stampede across the
plains. He told her of the great distances, and
whirling sands, and wild winds blowing; until the
blood leaped along her veins, and her heart was in
her throat.
“ Tell me some more ! ” she cried. “ Tell me !
Oh. . . I want to be a man, too, and—live ! ”
% For Honey had been on the demure track through
the shanty and through men’s hearts. Now, the
wild fever, and love, and sin, and desire in one
man’s veins had swung her outside that track for
always. He was gripping her hands, with the
sun-fire of the North in his eyes and the lust of it
in his hot words.
“No! Not that ! Be a woman, Honey. A
woman that men fight and hunger and kill for !
A woman to kiss and to hold and to keep ”
His arms were round her before she knew, and
the passion of his kisses ripening her cheeks to
crimson and her heart to its understanding of a
woman’s heritage.
Andy was shutting the bar when she went in,
and his good-humored face was clouded, Since
time forgotten he had been one of Honey’s lovers.
“ The Missus is waitin’ fur you,” he said ; then
halted before the glow on her face, looking past
her to Jack Hammond lighting a last pipe under
the lamp. The swagger of the man stung Andy
into desperation. He went out, with the blood
pumping in his ears, and his voice steadied by
savage control.
“ Is it you as is goin’ ter take her—out’n all on
us ? ” he asked.
The stinging heat and the grit of the Northern
desert-sand were Jack Hammond’s birth-right,
and the wild, lustful soul, and the quick-flowing
blood of the rover. Andy knew it, even as Jack
laughed, with the new ring of the master in his
speech.
“ I’m going to take her—when I like and where
I like,” he said. And when he came back from
the Murrumbidgee he did it.
It needed not the tongue of “the Missus” to
tell passing men that Honey was married and
away over the ranges. The very shanty looked
dull and gray, and the bar parlor was chill with-
out her quick laugh and the sun of her hair.
Then in three months she came again.
“Jack’s goin’ to the Nonda fur cattle,” she
said. “ Will you kip me till he comes back,
mother dear? He’ll be callin’ in for to say good-
bye.”
And the next week he came, and Honey met
him under the brigalows on the hill. The clumsy
pity of Jim and “the Missus” and others was
stinging her heart already, and her woman’s
pride was growing.
“ Take me, Jack ! Take me ! I can’t stand ter
have’em go sayin’as it’s hard on me. Jack, can
you bear to leave me when I’m feelin’ I can’t bear
to leave you? Oh, Jack, when I’m lovin’ you
more every day”—
He pulled out his pipe, brushing her forehead
with careless lips.
“ You mustn’t be a little fool, Honey. A feller’s
got ter work ter live. An’ I can’t take you where
I’m goin’.”
The North was calling him, with its hot smells
and its beckoning mirage, and its great distances.
His blood quickened at memory of camps on the
Mackenzie and wild nights at Cloncurry.
“I can’t stay, an’ I can’t take yer,” he said.
“A woman can’t do what a man does. We’re
born to be different. . . an’ you jus’ got ter wait,
little girl. I’m cornin’ back.”
She tried to believe it through that last night
when she lay awake, listening to his even
breathing, and fearing the dawn that would bring
the magpies to call the world from sleep. Then
he was gone ; with the clatter of his horses, and
the following dust, and a gay good-bye blown
down the track to her. In the belar by the door
a jackass was rocking with laughter. Andy flung
a stone at it. For it was a devil that knew too
much.
There were bleak, naked months after that day,
with neither written word nor message from Jack,
and only Andy’s skilful lies to comfort Honey.
She served in the bar, with the print frock and
the smooth hair of the old days, and there was just
the ring on her finger to tell of the man who had
bound her and gone North, uncaring. And later
on the drovers began to forget the meaning of
that ring, and to chaff Honey with the freedom of
old. And, because it is not good that a woman
should strip her soul bare before the world,
Honey gave them joke for joke; with pain behind
the laugh in her eyes, and no heart to drive the
Eointed words. And Andy watched, because he
ad no business to do more, and saw the fire in
her face when the clack of split hoofs came down
the street, with the snarl of a whip behind the
gleaming backs in the dust-cloud; and saw, too,
the fire fade and go out before the unfamiliar
tread in the bar.
In the beginning she asked after Jack daily,
eagerly, wistfully, with a shake in her voice.
And the drovers lied cheerfully, for they knew
Jack Hammond’s life from the inside, and there
was not one of them brave enough to stand up to
the pure-eyed girl and tell her of it. Later, there
was a time when she did not ask at all. This was
when Harry Deane came to the shanty, day, and
day, and day again, to hold Honey’s hand and
whisper to her in the bar-corners, never guessing
that Honey was playing to the gallery, because
the drovers were going North again, and there
was surely one of them who would meet with
Jack and tell a tale that should bring him home.
And Andy watched, because he had no business
to do more, and sickened at Deane’s smooth smile
and his smooth, gentlemanly speech set to hidden
evil.
There was summer in the air again, and the
whirring of a million crickets in the Mitchell
grass, and a blurr of heat over the unchanging
gray of the bush. Jim was ailing these days, and
“the Missus” grew thin with tending him, so
that Honey was alone in the bar when a half-
score drovers came in, with the overland slang on
their tongues, and the smell of the wild North-
west on their lean bodies and their faded clothes,
and on the boots that'held yet the dust of the
ranges.
Honey looked no more than a pale, quiet child,
in her plain frock ; and the men joked, unheeding
her, and told strange yarns split through with
oaths as she filled the glasses, with her throat
aching as it ached always, tearlessly, when the
virile life that was Jack’s became real in the
speech and w’ays of his kind. Then someone—
and Andy, coming through the parlor door, could
have sworn that it was Deane —asked a question
that brought laughter and a curse, and then Jack
Hammond’s name, with a bald, cruel sentence
added to make clear the breadth of the sin.
‘ ‘ Hush-h ! ” It was Jos Kindred on his feet
in rage. “Hold yer damned tongue, you !
Don’t yer know ? ”
Honey’s ears missed the whisper. She stood
dumb, with big eyes staring on the men. He who
had done the mischief stumbled over to her.
“Beg pardon, missus,” he said, awkwardly.
“ I—l never thought ”
The pity in the bearded, kindly face was a
whip-lash to her. She rushed past him, and out
up the hill to the brigalow patch, and Andy,
coming to the bar, helped the ten of them curse
Deane very earnestly.
But that night, after he had put the lights out,
Andy sat in the darkened bar with the passage
door open.
“For she’ll run wi’ Deane ter-niglit if there’s
any meanin’ in the faces o’ them,” he said, and
w r aited, listening for a step on the creaking stair.
It came, hurried and uncertain. Andy struck
a match to the candle on the bar, made one step,
caught Honey by the wrists, and swung her into
the room. She wore her print frock still, and
her head was shawled in the hot night. Without
looking Andy knew that the ring was gone from
her hand.
“ Where was yer goin’—at this hour ? ” he said,
sternly.
She struggled, half-afraid. For this was not
the Andy who had come and gone at her word all
these years.
“ Let me go ! Let me go ! It’s no business of
yours.”
“ You’re goin’ ter that smooth-faced devil
waitin’ for ye in th’ road,” he said. “ You,
Honey! You, ter shaine yerself an’ break yer
heart that way ! ’’
Her quick laugh hurt him.
“My heart’s broke long ago,” she said. “ An’
I’ve bin slikmed long ago—an’ every day since !
Did you hear ’em to-day ? Andy, I can’t stand no
more ! I can’t ! He’s goin’ to take me away.
He’ll take me away from all them as come pityin’
me.”
“ He can’t take yer away from what’s goin’
with ye—an’ that’s yer shame, an’ yer heart-
break. Honey, darlin’, was yer thinkin’ of us
what’s all knowed ye as pure girl an’ pure wife
when ye planned this ! ”
She shivered, ceasing to struggle in his grasp.
The familiar personality of the bar was on her
again, the smooth wood where she had slid the
glasses, year by year, to the boys sitting on the
rounded outer edge, the taps and bottles that she
knew the handling of in the dark, the shelf where
big Pat Gowan had set her up, short-skirted and
angry, until she bribed her release with a kiss, the
parlor door with the wear of ages showing black
round its handle. And above the door the slow
full tick of the big clock. It had beat on her
heart through all these empty months, and she
swerved from the sound of it now.
“Oh. , . leave me go,” she cried. “ It’s killin’
me.' It’s killin’ me, Andy ! And I can’t wait here no
more to hear the cattle coinin’. . . an’to run out,
lookin’. . . He’ll never come now. Did you hear
. . . did you hear what they said ? Andy. . .
I’m goin’ away to forgit him. . . for I’ll never
forgit him here.”
* * * «
The summer was a fleeting autumn when Jack
Hammond came South again, with the thunder
of hoofs in the narrow track, and the sunlight
splashing red and white on the heaving flanks in
the dust. Andy was alone in the bar, and there
was no Honey to flush, and pale, and flush again
as the drovers came over the verandah. Jack
Hammond passed straight into the bar parlor as
one who knew the way. The parlor was empty,
with the horsehair chairs set stiff against the wall,
and dried flowers smelling of dust on the mantel-
shelf. Jack called Andy in, and shut the door.
“ Where is she? ”he said, hardly. “I heard
she’d gone with Deane. Where is she ? ”
“ When did yer hear that?”
_ “ I —don’t know. I’ve come at top speed
since.” There was dust and sweat on his face,
and his long limbs showed weariness.
“ Yer’ve bin in a mighty ’urry ter ’urry,” said
Andy, bitterly. “What wud yer think she’d be
doin’ while you was ’urryin’ up roun’ the Gulf?”
“ Tell me, you ! By , I’ll have the throat
out of you ! Where is she ?”
“Go an’ find out! ” said Andy, and flung him-
self free. “Find her yerself, you as lost her
yerself! Wild Honey she was, an’ you knowed
it, an’ yer played wi’ her like she was a soft cat
what’d sit be the fire waitin’. . . Take yer hands
off ! They’re wantin’ me out in the bar ! ”
Jack Hammond turned through the outer door,
walked down the alley-way and across the road.
With loose rein his mare was cropping the grass
by the far gate. And under the whispering belars
beyond the gate her name stared up at him
whitely from a plain board set in the ground.
And so he found her himself.

A Great Sufferer Cured.
stomach is a very important organ, and, when in a disordered con-
dition, a multitude of ailments are the result. No other organ is
taxed to such an extent as the stomach, and it is only natural that
occasion arises when it calls for some assistance in performing the heavy
duties allotted to it. Bile Beans afford this
assistance, and enable the stomach to con-
tinue performing its natural functions
Mr. H. E. Neville, of 52 Addison Road,
Marrickville, Sydney, has proved this, and
writes :—“ I have much pleasure in testifying
to the merits of Bile Beans. I suffered with
terrible pains in my side and stomach, for
which I used several so-called remedies,
but could gain no relief. A friend
l'ecommended Bile Beans, and pre-
sented me with a few to try. These I
tried and gamed almost instant relief.
Thus encouraged, I purchased a fur-
ther supply, and, after taking four
JCJ
v
doses, the pains left me entirely, and I have had no return of the malady. I can
with confidence recommend Bile Beans to anyone similarly afflicted.

To My Lady Romance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
COME ! Oh, My Lady of the crocus flower,
That starred thy glossy tresses as with gold!
Let fall the petals on my boat this hour ;
Gleam many little sunsets as of old.
Summer hath come again to Venice dear ;
The frangipanni hastes ; the daffodil,
Piled on the boats from San Erasmo, here
Blazes its chrome, tho’ they are freighting still
Amber and purple fruit and flower. The red
And orange winged fisher boats —they sail
Out from the isles whose new grass is bespread,
And tedded ere its time had come to fail.
The boats, all blooded by the sunset, come
Back to the vesper shrine and the lagoon ;
Each church ha 3 haze and violet for dome ;
The sun dies in vermilion —and the moon
Is born of silver on a silver bed,
Set in a house all hazy blue and soft;
And straightway gilds the barges of the stead,
Laden with oil from many an island toft,
Unto my Venice, drowning in her tides,
That bring the crimson sea-weeds in by chance ;
Here where thou once wert happiest of brides,
The ocean drifts me, Oh ! my lost Romance !
Once did I come to this Lagoon of Life—
The water streaked, and yellow in the dawn —
The domes all rosy and the tides at strife—
That time we met upon a royal lawn.
Twice did I drift in at the fervid noon ;
The green lagoon lipped the white palace stairs—
The city lovely in its summer swoon —
Then came the spoils that are for him who dares.
I was your gondolier ! My insolence
In loving you I knew, and would not mend,
Yet you, love-equalised, said not “Go hence !’’
But bade me “Peace '’—then heard me to the end.
Titian and Veronese your palace painted,
Where the red palli cut the sap-green tide.
I was your gondolier—by labor tainted —
Yet you walked proudly, like a happy bride.
Great Tintoretto gemmed your palace wall,
And made the very floors all pavonine.
I was your gondolier, and to you thrall !
Yet did you make your regal beauty mine.
Your sires did steal the jasper of the East
Unto their palaces ; the porphyry,
The onyx, and the gold ! At every feast
Your house drank spoils of many a piracy.
But I was greater ! I, the godlike thief !
My two hands held a pirate band of ten ;
My lingers stole their richest gem—their chief.
I reived you, Queen, from all your servant men.
Think of the nights we spent, both steeped in
dream;
A desert silence on the black lagoon ;
The blue-black skies, impendent on the stream,
Made blacker by a weird, senescent moon.
And in the afternoons we’d drift and drift,
And talk old poems as the sun the sea
Dipped into while the fisher’s sail did lift —-
Beyond the Garden Papadopoli,
We drifted on—the micronated light
Gave place to stars, so loved by you, Romance !
You played upon the rebeck to the night,
And closer leaned to me, Oh ! Happy Chance !
All of thy garments smelled of forest scent;
Of bush, and flower, and rimose trunk and tree ;
From out thine hair the frangipanni lent
Breath to the night, and ecstasy to me.
Now have I lost, because I could not hold,
Thee who, of all things, art the world of me.
Once did I see thee near a shepherd’s fold,
Once heard thy sea-voice singing in ttie sea.
Once did I mourn thee on a funeral barge ;
My heart was stone ; but all my brain did writhe,
Seeing thy broken column by the marge—
The winged world on the sternpost, and the scythe.
Twice in this life I held, and let thee go ;
Once on a plain beneath a night of stars ;
Once in a eucalyptus park, where trees arow
Sweep down unto a river’s granite bars.
Is that deep dusk remembered yet by you ?
The gum-tree’d slope that to the river ran ?
The sounds below that unto music grew ?
The night you were The Woman; I, The Man ?
Tho’ that was but an incomplete embrace ;
Altho’ ’twas drinking, from Life’s chalice, sips ;
You shall remember all that moment’s grace ;
My half-requited kiss burns on your lips.
I knew not how to hold thee ! Roses are
Like to My Lady, and I crushed their leaves ;
I who, unfit for earth, was given a star,
Did darken it—and thus My Lady grieves.
Thou art not all a goddess, praise the Fates !
Through all his life the mortal man doth cling
To perishable woman. Loves and hates
Are man’s, not God’s ! Love is a mortal thing.
Yet not too mortal thou ! Something divine
Is in thy life. And lam gross, and mean
Of appetite, and drink-the world like wine ;
Still may you glimpse my high desire between.
Rough man am I; and yet, of all the earth,
Vulcan wived Venus ! Beauty to the strong !
Strength unto beauty for the perfect birth !
Tonic to dominant to make the song !
Times hast thou tried, enduring, and anon
Grieving, not hating me, for errors great ;
Cleaving to me again, when crime had gone,
Have I not earned thee once again, my Fate ?
Yea ! I will search the city—find the wings
Plumed or sharded, that may bear me, on
Unto the casements of thy kinsmen—Kings,
With feathered pinion, or with elytron.
But, an’ I find thee not, I’ll cry thy name
In every street, lagoon, and palaced shore;
I will thus closely search, unto thy shame,
Till Fate shall bring me to thy mirador.
And then, I seeing again your garment’s hem,
Shall plead and threaten—till, with pity rent,
You smile, all love ! Your golden anadem
Making your beauty more mirificent.
When to j our palace I shall row my boat,
You’ll look down as of old—star-eyed, benign—
And send a shower of golden blowth afloat
To make an air-path from your house to mine.
So, hide your heart as secret as you may ;
But when I, earnest, call, you’ll answer me !
And, when I bid you, you shall come away
And drift, through Lidi and lagoon, to sea !
VENICE.

Down the Red Lock Lane.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
tT was Clara Cooney’s wake. The walls
of the stuffy room were draped with black
silesia. The coffin containing the remains
of the poor woman of the town was placed in the
centre of the floor. It was covered with sickly
flowers and surrounded with candles. Bottles of
beer lay on a side table
“ Jugger” had gone round with the hat. Clara
had “taken on with” this notorious thief after
“Chinny the Crow ” had been sent to the
“Farm.” She had longed for Chinny’s release.
Chinny had always been good to her, whereas
Jugger had beaten her and driven her to drink
and despair. It was owing to a brutal blow that
Jugger gave her, because she said she wanted
Chinny back, that Clara suddenly puffed out. At
least the blow and the drink did it.
Jugger collected a few quid. Though latterly
a brawling drunkard, Clara was much liked. She
had been a good-hearted woman when “on
with ” Chinny, and that was not forgotten.
Thieves, spielers, fallen women, vagrants, pub-
licans and sinners of the deadliest district in
Melbourne, threw in their coins liberally in honor
of the sad occasion. For the poor help the poor,
and the outcast helps the outcast. Often had
they passed the dipper to pay Clara’s fines for
“drunk and disorderly”; now all reckoned it
was up to them to give her a gorgeous wake.
A select crowd tilled Clara’s room. The people
there had no sympathy for Jugger, but they re-
membered Clara and Chinny, and the women
grew tangled and sentimental. Jugger opened
the beer. The company drank deep and silently
to the memory of the departed.
Outside, in the tangled network of lanes that
made up the thieves’ and vagrants’ quarter, every
respect was shown for the dead. No women
blasphemed at the corners. No wandering drunk
was garroted. The cops had for once an easy and
orderly beat. The publican of the “ Bucks’
Retreat” observed that the district was as quiet
as an opium den.
Through the narrow window in Clara’s room
the moon looked down on the coffin and on the
white faces of the watchers. Painted women
were in tears when Jugger rose to respond on
behalf of the deceased—to respond to her
“health” so ably proposed by the boss of all the
thieves, the old and honored “Shandy ” Brown.
“ Dearly beloved Clara”—he began.
A “Buck’s” whistle rang through the room.
Women shrieked; men looked startled; Jugger
turned pale.
“Chinny the Crow,” they muttered.
“Good luck ! he’s out,” said old Shandy.
They went down and unbarred the door.
Chinny the Crow came in.
Chinny was a man about 30, clean-shaven, and
with the gaol crop. Dressed in a smart grey suit,
he looked fine and fit. He was a medium-sized,
broad-shouldered man. He had blue, shifty eyes,
but well-cut features, and a massive, decisive
jaw.
Chinny looked at the coffin. Then he looked
at Jugger.
“Hush! ’Ave a bit respect. Poor Clara
Jugger gasped.
“Stow it,” said Chinny. Everybody felt
uneasy. Chinny faced Jugger square. He spoke
in a calm voice.
“I’ve a point to argue with yer. Wot right
’ave you ’ere ? ”
“ Gorblime, ain’t I ’er bloke? ” cried J ugger.
“ No,” Chinny hissed. “You ’er bloke ! You ?
Yer killed her,'ye cur ; I know it. Women an’
drunks —them’s your size. Git quit ov ’ere. Git
back to where ye belong, ye sewer-rat.”
Old Shandy tried to quell the threatened not.
Chinny put him aside, and went on again
deliberately :
“Yer wanted to git rid ov me. Wanted to git
on with Clara. Git ’er to keep yer in ’onerst idle-
ness. I tumbled to yer gime.”
Jugger rose scared. “Ladies an’ gents, I
appeal”
“You?” Chinny interrupted. “I am t done
with you. ’Oo got ther rossers to drop on me
with a stiff fer ther crust? Ye dropped yer
bundle, didn’t yer? Ye sneakin’ snike, so I fell
inter the pool, eh ? ”
“ I never done it. It’s a lie,” cried J ugger.
“Tell that ter ther birbs. I know w’en ther
balloon goes up. An’ you quit ’ere ”
“Shut yer gab,” Jugger broke in. “Its my
girl ”
“Ain’t pleased ter see me, eh? Thought I
would be planted a couple more months on ther
‘Farm’ fer ther benefit of me ’ealth ? But you
quit. This ’ere’s my place. Clara was mine ; an’,
damn ver, she’s mine now.”
Jugger looked a picture of terror. Fires were
raging in Chinny’s wrath, and they might spread
at any moment. Jugger didn’t want to be caught.
“ Don’t git excited, Chinny,” said Alice. “’Ave
a taste ov this. It’ll do yer good.” Fat Alice
was always peacemaker.
“ Wot’s ther use ov growlin’,” remarked Flash
Freddie. “ Ther girl’s a gonner now.”
Chinny threw down the beer. “She’s mine,”
he cried, “ an’ I ain’t finished with you, J ugger.
This is to ther clean finish. Wot did Clara say w’en
you wos down Black Eagle Lane larst Wedn’d’y,
w’en yer kicked ’er in ther neck an’ killed ’er, ye
bleedin’, blushin’” n , _
There was a sudden scuffle. Jugger flashed out
a knife, but before his arm came down Chinny
landed him on the point of the jaw. Jugger
staggered and then fell heavily, the back of his
head striking the sharp edge of the coffin.
* » * *
Dawn came blinking through the blinds. In the
mixed lights the coffin gleamed weirdly. The
flowers had faded, and the candles were burning
out. Chinny occupied the chair.
Jugger, who had recovered consciousness, lay
sullen and scowling in the corner. A red wipe was
tied round his forehead, and he was drinking
One by one the people of the night sneaked
out Those who were not too drunk or too tired
would attend the funeral in the afternoon.
At last Shandy and Fat Alice took Jugger
away. Chinny was left with the dead. Re
dropped down by the coffin. Alice came back
and kissed him. ,
“ Buck up, Chinny,” she said, Clara always
loved you best.”

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it. and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
