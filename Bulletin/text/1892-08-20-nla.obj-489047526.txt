ACT I.
Scene— The Old Home at Mordliu. Exterior of
* Virtue’s cottage.
(Chiefs and Susan come briskly along rural path.)
Charley Chiefs. — O, Susan, every time yon
say ‘No ’ you seem to run a gimlet through my
faithful liver. If you won’t marry me straight
Jut have me for a month on approbation (she
slaps his face). I didn’t mean what you were
thinking of, Susan (she attempts to slap again,
hid he dodges), I meant, let me be engaged to you
on trial.
Susan (coquettishly). —Well, Charley, if ever
j do want a husband
Chiefs,—And he’s a handy thing to have in th e
’ouse
Susan.—l’ll give yon the first refusal.
Chiefs.—You’ve given me 15 refusals already.
Susan, I’ll never leave off loving you till you’re
Mrs. C.
Susan.—You’d leave off quick enough then, no
doubt. I’m glad you’ve got the honesty to warn
me in time, Mr. Chipps. Good morning ! (Runs
away. Chiefs catches her — struggles for kiss —
business and exit together.)
Enter Jim and Knubbly.
Juj.—’Ere’s the place where we was to meet the
young squire, so I .votes ive sit down on a log,
and scowl (they do so).
Knubbly.—’E’s goin’ to pay ns well for this
job, I ’ope, after tellygraphing of us down from
London. I tell yer wot, Jim, I’m rather full up
of workin’ for his nibs, ’e wants us to be too
wicked at the price.
j ljr —Sorft,’e comes! (They rise gloomily as
Rancyd D. approaches.) Well, guvnor, wot’s in
the wind, this time?
Rancyd.—Mischief, of course. Don’t you see
I’m in evening dress and smoking a cigarette.
Jim (sullenly) —Another murder, I suppose?
Rancyd—What a dreadfully coarse expression !
I may require a young women to be removed.
(Aside.) Curse In r ! Wait for meat the Old
Copse at 9 o’clock sharp. Now, go. (Exit Jim
and Knubbly, scowling hard.)
(Enter Ruth Tereful, in lung black cloak, icitku
hood Over her head.)
Ruth —Rancyd ! (Attempts a mash, but is re- 1
pelled.)
Rancyd—So you’ve come.
Ruth— Yes, Rancyd—l call Heaven to witness
that I’m here. Take pity on me ! See what a
long slab of misery I am, and let me put the banns.
up to hide my shame.
Rancyd— Why can’t you bo reasonable? You
know that the man who smokes cigarettes never
marries the female in distress— (aside) —l have c.
better game on. Here, take these notes and go
back to London and lose yourself.
Ruth (throwing hood, back) —Heaven is my wit-
ness that I would rather die than touch another’
penny of your money. I will proclaim your in -
famy to the village (Rancyd makes horrible facer;
aside) and then drown my disgrace in the dear old .
brook (she weeps) —the brook whose babbling will,
lull me to sleep once more as it did in the day;-
when I was good and pure and hadn’t begun to.
talk so much about my honour. The dear old
brook ! It’s only two feet deep, but I can hold my
weary head under until I’m dead. But fust to*
tell all! (Is about to rush off and enlighten tin «
village when Rancyd stops her.) "
Rancyd (dissembling)- Of course I mean to-?
marry you—the license is in my pocket. Como to |
the Old Copse at a quarter past nine.
Ruth (tenderly)— The dear Old Copse where wel
used to meet.
Rancyd— Certainly, the same Old Copse. Come ,:
there and you will find a clergyman waiting to*
perform the ceremony in the moonlight.
Ruth— Heaven bless you, Rancyd ! I knew'
you would not let me bo ruined in the usual way.
Rancyd —There, that’s enough. Now, go before*;
wo are discovered. (Exit Ruth, full of gratitude.)- ■.
Curse her ! She’ll have to be cleared out of mj |
path like the rest of them. ( Exit Ranycd.)
(Enter Victor Virtue.)
V.V. —I wear a bright brown velveteen suit and'
spotless leather gaiters, like all hard-working
young farmers. I'm ns confiding as a sucking*
dove. I never yet have told a lie, although,
marriage, of course, might alter me in that
respect Marriage! (He sits down on rustic seat*
and looks nobler than ever.) What will she say, 1
wonder! (Enter Florence, unobserved. She
tea’ksforward and breathes on the back of Victor’s.
neck, yet he doesn't know she is there.) If I dare to.
ask, “Florence, will you be my wife?” what will
her innocent lips reply !
Florence (making her presence known ) —She will
answer, “ Yes, for better or for worse ! ” ( Victor.
rises with cry of joy fid surprise and they cuddle in-
the cold, distant manner peculiar to stage-lovers.)
Victor—What have I done to deserve this,
happiness ! I am but a lowly farmer in a fancy -
dress ball costume, and you are so rich and-
beautiful.
Florence —You are an out-of-the way sort of
farmer, miraculously brave and strong. Think of
how a mob always trembles when you cry, “ Come
on, ye curs !” and of how the biggest supers fab.
down heavily if you pretend to hit them in tho
most unscientific manner. You are my sweet,
girlish idea of what a hero ought to be. With
your protecting arm (Victor draws up right fore-
arm and feels his biceps proudly) ever near me I
would fear nothing. You are prepared to seize
an elephant by the throat and hurl it to the foot-
lights, if necessary. ■
{Whilst they embrace again Sir Reginald and
Rancyd enter).
RvNCYD (to Sir Reg.) - What did I tell you !
Sir Reg. (advances and snatches E. from V.) —
Explain this situation.
Victor (nobly) —lt means, sir, that your
■daughter has consented to be my wife.
Sir Reg. —Monstrous! The blood of the Wrex-
Ihams is as old as the hills that lie beyond the
Manor House, and the man who seeks an alliance
with my family must at least be (looks to ihe
•hediamondcd Cohen family in the dress-circle for
■ sympathy ) of gentle birth.
Enter Kkwte, v:ho sidles up to Rang yd and
•whispers “ I’re got the forged papers ready.”
.Rancyd nods. " Enter Chiefs, Susan, and
Villagers alt in a heap.
Victor— The lady shall decide between us.
Florence (taking his hand)— This is my answer!
Your old homo shall bo my old homo till death do
■us part. I lose all my fortune if I marry without
vnapa’s consent, but what is money to a Sims and
Bettitt heroine?
Chiefs — Hooroo ! I feel ns full of joy as a
umall boy outside of a large roley-poley pudden.
I iusan, come to these arms! (Susan affects indig-
r lalion. “ Comic relief ” business).
Kewte ( coming forward) —You have no homo
{to Victor), your great-grandfather made all the
property over to me ninety years ago (produces
'forged papers).
Victor— Then I am a beggar—but no matter-r r-
J will go abroad. Farewell, darling, keep a brave
’ heart and I will return to claim you in the last
-act. These papers have crushed mo for a time,
but I have youth, and strength, and energy, and
•with God's help I shall yet prove my innocence
'before all the world.
j Susan (who is level-headed)-— You're not guilty
I of anything np to now.
Victor —No, I forgot that. I mean, I shall go
forth and make a rapid fortune in a distant land.
I, (Sir Reginald draws Florence away from
Victor). Good-bye. all! Good-bye, old home
'(turns towards O.H. and raises his hat, then gazes
j'ondly at the landscape). How dark the clouds
gather away over Tnrniptop Chase ! ( lights deten,
■and slow music). A storm draws nigh and the
birds in the trees twitter where the leaves are
'thickest. But when the rain has fallen and
refreshed the dear old soil —How I love every inch
•of it!—new blades of grass will spring up to bless
the Giver of all damp tilings. In my heart
already the blades of fresh, green hope are spring-
ing up, and the present downpour of affliction
shall surely yield a ripe haystack of happiness in
the days to come. Good-bye, everybody! (He
staggers off, after making a vain attempt to kiss
his girl, who faints in father's arms. Kewte
and Rang yd exchange appalling glances. Vil-
lagers and SUSAN express grief and CHIEFS
exclaims “Dam I” as the curtain falls),
ACT 11.
Scene— The Old Copse.
The act opens with a little more “comic relief ”
between Scsan and Chiefs, who eventually
disperse after another long struggle for a kiss.
Enter Jim and Knubbly, followed by Rancyd.
He tells them to hide behind a tree until he whistles
for them.
Rancyd [sol.) —The noble farmer has been
cleared out of the way (lights cigarette) —those
forged papers were a happy thought, ha! ha !
and now I can act the part of consoler to Florence
with her father’s best wishes to help rue. She has
<£30,000 a year on the mother’s side, and a million
in her own right if she dies before her uncle. The
stake is worth playing fur. As for Ruth—curse
her ! —well, another corpse more or less makes no
difference to a desperate man. (Emiles sardoni-
cally as he watches the smoke curling upwards.)
Enter Ruth.
Ruth—Yon arc here then, dear Rancyd. How
gloomy the old copse seems to-night ( tights down
tower). I should feel frightened if 1 didn’t know
I was just going to get married. But where is the
clergyman, and who will give me away, Raney
dearest ?
Rancyd— Marriages are made in Heaven they
say, Ruth Tereful, and it’s up there you will have
to look for a parson. ( Blows whistle—and Jin and
Knubbly rush out.)
Ruth— Oh ! Rancyd—spare me, spare me !
Rancyd - That's what I’m going to do. I can
spare the loss of any girl who stands between me
and my plans. (To J. and K.) —'The old well
behind the Haunted Oak—you understand !
Knubbly (whispering)— How about the price,
guv’nor?
Rancyd—Pshaw ! Drop her down and you’ll
have nothing to complain of.
(The two chase Ruth all round the stage and
finally catch her by the hair. They drag her off to
the well and drop her down. Her screams from
below igrow fainter, and cease. J. and K. return
to Rancyd, wiping their brows. He gives them
notes. They compare notes and snort.)
Jim—’Taint enough, capting. This is £g less
than last time.
Rancyd (lighting cigarette)— Of course, there was
no risk in this case. Besides, I’ve lost a lot of
money on the Turf lately, and .
Knubbly —Now, look ’ere, guv’nor, we don't
want to be bad friends, but bizness is bizness. A
dark night's work —a dark night’s pay. Why, wo
can get as much as this for choking a baby.
Rancyd —O, go to the Devil! (Strolls off,)
Knubbly —Curse him, for a stingy dawg—that's
wot ’c is ! (Slaps his thigh.) Why, if the girl
ain’t dead yet, danged if we won't rescue her—
wot d’yer say, mate? Let’s pull her up agin,
( They go to the well and look down.)
Jim— ’Ave ycr got a rope ?
Knubbly —’Ere's one hanging to a tree, must
’ave been left by a Sunday-school picnic wot
wanted a swing.
Jim—Tie one h’end round a tree and Pll let
myself down by the other. (They fix rope and J.
descends whilst K. watched above. Presently K.
says, “ There's his signal to pull /” and hauls up
Jim, carrying Ruth under left arm. They place
girl on the ground, and put flask to her lips. She
moans faintly.)
Knubbly —Blow me tight if she ain’t quite
lively. Wot shall we do with her now?
Jim— Take her up to London and prodooce her
as a surprise at the. bloomin’ finish. (They carry
Ruth off in a flood of limelight—stoic curtain. )
ACT 111.
Scene I.—A Desert in Timbuctoo.
Victor Virtue discovered asleep. He is dressed
in black broadcloth suit, shovel hat and dirty
white choker. Gun and portion of Bible by
his side. He murmurs “Florence!” aid

Victor V.—Another day, and still no signs of
anything to eat. It must be nearly four months
since food passed my lips. This sinking sensation
at the stomach is horrible, but I must struggle on
for Florence’s sake. (Fulls down and seems deliri-
ous, then resumes talk in a dazed manner.) How
did I come by these clothes ? Ah I I remember.
One day I was sitting on the bank of a river when
I saw a missionary swimming with the tide. An
alligator swam out from the reeds almost at my
feet and seized the missionary in his cruel jaws.
(Shrieks at the recollection.) The brave fellow
started a hymn as the reptile dragged him down,
and his red blood left a ghastly track on the water
to tell the awful tale. O Heaven ! —why didn’t
the alligator take me instead of the other good
man ? Perhaps I was too thin, too thin, too thin.
(Has another slight attack of delirium and recovers.)
The missionary was quite plump. He had left his
clothes on the bank higher up the stream. I put
them on—yes, I remember now. There was a
Bible in the tail-pocket, and that nourished me for
a while. I read the Psalms and chewed the cover.
Let me chew some more cover, f Feels for cover
and finds it all gone. Gnaws wildly at the air.)
This horrible pain 1 (Falls bach again on the
desert.)
Enter a strange figure , crawling along on its
hands and knees. Victor regains consciousness
and perceives object.
Victor. —Ha ! What’s that ? A wild animal!
Providence has sent food for the wanderer.
(Takes •gun and shoots figure, which rolls over
and exclaims “O, Gawd !” Victor totters for-
ward and proceeds to examine his prey. It sits
up — limelight — and disclose s face of Kewte.)
Victor. —You here !
Kewte. —Yes, I came over to Timbuctoo on
business, and I got bushed in the desert.
Victor.—l thought you were a lion when I tired.
Kewte (squeezing V.’s hand). —I’m sure you
didn’t take me for a lawyer. But I deserved to be
shot —most lawyers do. Go back to England and
take possession of the Old Home. Those papers
were forged. Rancyd Dayvlsh got me to do it.
Return as soon as you can, or he will rob you of
your promised bride. Forgive me. (Victor sup-
ports him in his arms.) You’ll find the papers
wrapped round some ham sandwiches in my hat.
I ve been —a—bad —man —in —my —(Kewte chokes
and dies. As he falls back his hat rolls off, and

Victor (with mouth full of sandwiches). —I am
saved, saved at last!
Scene ll.—Morning Room at Wrexham Manor.
Sir Reginald and Rancyd discovered.
Sir Reg.—Yes, my boy, it was her mother's
dying wish that the money should remain in the
family. Florence must and shall be yours. ( Rings
bell.) (Enter Susan Purely. > Tell your mistress
that I would speak with her.
Susan. —Well, I arst your pardon, sir, but I
hope it ain’t about that tiling. (Points at
Rancyd.)
Sir Reg.—Peace, Susan, and do as you are bid.
(Exit S.)
Rancyd.—Why do you have that girl in your
service?
Sir Reg.—lt was a whim of my daughter'*.
Florence is attached to her for the sake of —well,
you can guess the foolish reason.
Enter Florence.
Florence.—You wished to see me ?
Silt Reg. {affectionately) —Florence, my clear,
you know I desire to see you happily married
before I am put away in the vault with my long
line of ancestors. Your cousin Rancyd is tho
husband I have chosen for you, and he is equally
anxious for the day to be named. {Sheshudders.)
Rancyd.—Florence, have you no word of en-
couragement ?
Florence. —My heart and hand are promised to
another, and I cannot change. Some girls, who
have not been trained in the Sims and Fettitt
school, might forget an impecunious farmer after
he had been gone for six long weary years, but
my love for Victor feeds ever on the hope of seeing
him return with a large fortune. Night or day ho
is never out of my thoughts.
Rancyd.— How can he return when he’s dead?
Florence.— l’ll not believe it. He couldn’t
possibly die. Ho was so phenomenally strong
and energetic.
Rancyd. —But suppose I show you proofs {brings
out forged letter and shows it to SIR Reg., who
reads it upside dawn).
Sir Reg. {putting hand gently on Florence's
shoulder) —This letter, my child, is indeed from
Victor. He wrote it in Darkest Africa eleven
days ago. It states that he has only five minutes
longer to live, and concludes with the hope that
you will marry your cousin as soon as possible.
Florence. —How kind and thoughtful he ever
was ! (falls across the table and sobs bitterly.)
Rancyd {takes her hand). — And you will be
mine, dear cousin ?
Florence ( rising solemnly). — The wish of the
dead is my command.
Rancyd {aside). —At last! The forged letter
was a happy thought. {Tableau and curtain.)
ACT IV.
Scene.— Same as Act I.
{Enter Chirps, icho sings chorus of comic song.
Enter Susan, crying.)
Chirps —Weeping, my angel, and we’re to be
spliced in another month ! Can’t you wait?
Susan —Imperent wretch. (Slaps his face.) It’s
the young mistress I’m crying about. She’s going
to be married to-morrow, and more’s the pity.
Chirrs— Who to ?
Susan— That there snake with an eyeglass, drat
him !
Chirrs [whistles)— Don’t be so sure, Susan. I’ve
got a surprise for you. Who do you think is down
the village at this blessed moment ?
Susan —Not Mr. Victor !
Chirps—The very same! Mr. Victor, with a
’ehnet on his ’ead and a lot of medals on his chest,
a-looking as handsome as my new grey mare.
Susan shrieks and falls into Charley’s arms.)
Susan— Let me go. I must run up to the Manor
and tell the news. (Exit S. and C.)
Enter Victor ( slow music.)
Victor —Back once more at the dear old home !
{Sits down on stump of tree.) I bought this uni-
form and medals at a pawnbroker’s in London, so
that I might reappear in good style. I will wait
here for something to turn up. The dear old
home—how peaceful everything seems !
Enter Florence.
Florence ( carefully looking away from V.)—l
felt that I must pick one last bunch of the wild
blossoms he used to love ( plucks paper flowers
growing for the special purpose), and put them
under my pillow this last night of the old life.
Dear Victor ! How strong and brave he was .
(Turns and sees\.) Victor, my love! then you
are not so dead as they told me !
Victor. —No, darling, not dead, but back again
to claim you and the old home (they embrace).
Enter Rancyd, Sir Reginald, Susan, Chirps
and Villagers.
Rancyd (to V.) —Stand back, you beggar !
Sir Reg. —What is this ! We all thought your
bones were bleaching in Darkest Africa. Did you
not write this? (products letter),
Victor —That letter, Sir Reginald, is a forgery
like these papers (produces papers). The deeds
said to have been drawn up by my great-grand-
father —bless his memory ! (raises hat) —were the
vile invention of Silas Kewte. He confessed his
guilt to me, with his dying breath, in a distant
land.
Rancyd (aside)— Confusion!
Chipps —Rather rough on the rattlesnake, eh,
Susan ?
Victor (taking R. by the throat)— You dog ! It
was all your work. You plotted to drive me from
the old home—you forged this story of my death !
(hurls R. a few yards).
Sir Reg. —The case looks somewhat black
against you, Rancyd. What have you to say ?
Rancyd —lt’s a pack of infamous lies ! This
beggar’s word is not worth a snap of the finger
(snaps ’em), and there’s no one else who can
produce proofs against me.
(Enter Ruth, Jim, and Knubbly in a hurry.)
Ruth.—Yes, I can prove you to be a black-
hearted villain.
Jim and Knubbly.—Ditto here, Oapting.
- Rancyd (taken aback). —Who is this woman?
Ruth. —The girl who’s been betrayed.
Knubbly. —The girl you paid us arf-price to
chuck down a well. We’ve turned Queen’s Evi-
dence, me and Jim, and [the game’s up with yer
royal ’ighness.
Enter policeman, xcho puts handcuffs on Rancyd.
Rancyd.—Curse you all! (Exit Jim, Knubbly,
and Rancyd, with policeman.)
Chipps.— Bless you, Mr. Victor! I knew it
would all turn out right. I told Susan you’d come
back in time to stand godfather to our first.
(Susan tries to slao him. More comic relief.
Susan rushes to Florence and kisses her hand.)
Victor (leading F. forward) —Have we your
consent at last ?
Sir Reg. —Yes, my boy. To refuse you would
be to insult the uniform of that Gracious Queen
in whose service you have evidently won the re-
wards which no money could buy. I refer to those
medals on your breast. (Shakes V. by the hand).
Victor (nobly)— God bless you, sir ! (Aside)— I
thought they would please him.
Florence— My heart is too full to let me speak.
Victor— See, darling, the red sun is sinking in
the West, the cows are prowling aci o -s Mushroom
Meadows just as they always used to prowl, and
in the bright future we shall look back on the dark
past and rejoice in the—(rest of the speech drowned

Dibbs dining with Queen Victoria’s
hangers-on was not a more melancholy obieri
than Bismarck stumping Germany in the interests
of “Government by the representatives of tl
people.” Yet the Germans appear still to believe
in the man who was crushed by his own ill
doctrine of absolute power for the Crown and
even in Vienna they have been shouting “Long
live the great Bismarck !” He seemed to be great
as long as he had a million bayonets at his back
but in 50 years’ time, when Germany has revolted
against military tyranny, and learnt that glory
means heavy taxation and empires are vain
historians will quote Bismarck as an instance of
how little real wisdom is required in the govern-
ing of a docile people by main force. Meanwhile"
however, it is rather rough upon the knocked-out
bully that somebody should have found a strong
personal resemblance to him in—Carington !
Five ingenious birds of prey, including a
baronet (they had many Australian victims)
were recently captured in London on a charge of
forming bogus “literary” societies for the annexa-
tion of all they could put their hands on. These
societies, which lasted just as long as the landlord
of the “ head ” office gave credit for the rent, and
collapsed when he put the bailiff in, invited
entrance-fees and annual subscriptions in advance
and undertook to publish books, procure pur-
chasers for pictures, and further the interests of
art in general, on the sole security of lump sums
of money paid down. When a hopeful bard came
along with a roll of poems the society arranged to
pay half the expenses of publication if the bard paid
the other half. He usually jumped at the offer,
and waited with a kindling eye for the triumphant
success of a volume that never came out, whilst
the society invested his deposit in baccarat and
riotous living. A victim, when he came worrying
for proofs, would be told that the printer had
caught the measles, and so the game went on
until it was time for the society to wind itself up
in the middle of the night and start again under
anew title. Nobody seems to know for certain
what became of the MSS. confided to the baronet
and his four pals, but it is supposed that they
used to sell novels, historical works, tragedies,
comedies, magazine-articles, and collections of
poems, in blank verse or otherwise, at a half-
penny a pound to the butcher, so that nothing
might be wasted. For twenty years these kindred
societies have browsed on the evergreen crops of
young literary ambition, and Heaven only knows
how much material for heart-rending stories lies
hidden beneath the rough details of this unique
fraud.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleger
and hospitals of Europe. Ho has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hit
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. Ills practico
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE FOUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOU S DEBILIT Y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

SATURDAY, AUGUST 20, 1892.
Hail! Depression.
The depression which lias for the past seven
years weighed on the spirits of the Australasian
people has fared even worse than Satan him-
self. There has never been a good word said
for it, whereas a canny Scot, characteristically
desirous of standing well with both sides,-once
remarked that “(Jod is good, and the Deil’s no
sae bad.” It is about time, therefore, that some-
body should take the part of the Depression.
We propose, consequently, to assume the role
of advocatiis Diaboli in this particular. We
fortify ourselves, at the outset, with a quotation,
“Sweet are the uses of adversity.” It can be
demonstrated, we believe, that the real malady
which Australia has been atHicted by has not
been Depression at all. The real sickness was
the boom—the Depression is merely the prostra-
tion and disturbance occasioned by the effort of
the industrial constitution to throw off the
malady and rally from its effects. Were a
score of mineral discoveries equal to the Broken
Hills lode and the Mount Morgan crater to be
made, simultaneously with the occurrence of a
succession of good grass seasons and a rise in
the market price of pastoral, mineral, and
agricultural produce, these young communities
would experience a healthy development of
growth, quite distinct from the puffy inflation
which preceded the still existing prostration.
Real and substantial expansion of that kind, in
which the formation of bone and sinew, blood
and fibre, would proceed simultaneously, would
involve no subsequent reaction. The growth
of the body politic and economic might, and
doubtless would, after a period of rapid ex-
pansion, settle down for awhile to consolidate
what it had gained. There might even be a
partial contraction while the young tissues
solidified. But there would be none of
the feverish prostration which has fol-
lowed upon a mere morbid puffing out
of the membranes. Australia is not
nearly so sick as she has been while people
have ignorantly been boasting of the financial
dropsy which exaggerated her economic bulk,
the fire with which fever lit her eyes, and the
flush which it imparted to her cheek. Her
financial condition looks bad just now to the
uninstructed, because eruptions of blains and
boils disfigure the surface and the epidermis is
peeling from the body.
* # *
To drop figures of speech, the condition of
affairs was infinitely worse while the bogus
financial syndicates and companies were in the
full and active employment of their malignant
energy, than it is now that these mischievous
institutions are reduced to impotence. The
boom period was a carnival of chicanery. The
men who received greatest prominence and
most distinction and success were the men who
to intensest energy added the hardiest un-
scrupulousness. The real heroes of, say, the
N.S. Wales boom have been such people as
Beix and Davis, who before they sagaciously
bolted with their moderate plunder, were
regarded in financial circles as gentlemen of
admirable enterprise and enviable financial
endowments. Equal to them in dashing initia-
tive, but inferior in the judgment which teaches
when the moment for realisation has arrived,
was Mr, Taylor, lately laid by the heels. So
much for New South Wales heroes of the boom.
In Victoria the same story is to bo told. The
bold and much admired operators who suddenly
sprung from monetary insignificance to deal in
operations of tens and hundreds of thousands
sterling, arc cither in gaol, or laboriously ex-
plaining why they should not be placed on fixed
deposit for a term of years.
# # #
It is not at all remarkable that some of the
earliest sufferers from the operation of the
criminal law, consequent on the collapse of the
boom period, have received their sentences with
a pained surprise, which had every appearance
of being genuine, and which was evidently
shared by quite a number of sympathising
friends. Mika ms, of Melbourne, was regarded
in many quarters as a martyr, and in Sydney,
Frank J. Smith, ex-M.P., and his pals appealed
for alleviation of sentences with what appeared
to be a genuinesense of being suffering innocents.
The fact is, that the practices for which these
offenders were subjected to punishment have
been so universally adopted by speculative
commercial adventurers, that their essential
criminality was commonly lost sight of. In
reality, it needed either a very fine intelli-
gence, or a peculiarly delicate conscience, to
distinguish between the class of transactions
which are allowed by the conventions of specu-
lative business and those which lie outside the
pale of the permissible. It may be questioned
whether there is one among the offences, for
which persons have already been convicted,
which would, if known to ordinary business
men, have exposed the perpetrators to anything
like commercial ostracism. There is room for
doubting whether dealings between financial
institutions and the directors of them, such as
have already brought some persons into gaol,
are really so outrageously unusual as might be
supposed from the attitude of virtuous horror
assumed by persons connected with the older-
established and wealthier class of establish-
ments. Granted such searching inquisitions into
the dealings of these latter institutions, especi-
ally as regards their earlier stages, and there is
every likelihood that discoveries would be made
quite on a footing with those which are causing
people to raise 1 heir eyebrows to-day in connec-
tion with smal’er and more recently-launched
societies, &c. No one engaged in speculative
finance considess it criminal to bet upon a cer-
tainty, so to speak. Such a course is depre-
cated, indeed, and is never openly confessed.
But he is indeed an innocent who is unaware
that persons “ in the know ” habitually employ
their advantage to acquire shares or other
valuable considerations at a lower price than
sellers would assent to were they placed in
possession of knowledge which they are entitled
to have, and which it is the bounden duty of
the very men who profit by their ignorance to
communicate to them. The reverse process
goes on with equal constancy. For a manager
or a director to be ruined by mere fluctuations
in the value of properties which he controls is
a thing practically unheard of. If the steam-
boat reaches its destination as intended, they
are never found to be carrying an unpleasant
baby at the end of the trip. It is only when
the ship strikes a snag half-way that they are
caught so burdened.
* # «
The distinguishing virtue of periods of de-
pression is that they serve to administer a fillip
to the public conscience, which, in times of
prosperity, is very ape to go to sleep. The
thieving and swindling is going on all the time,
but it is only during a cold snap that it is found
out. During series of years when a community
is solidly progressing in wealth or even
advancing on an upward grade of fic-
titious enhancement of values, trustees con-
vert trust - moneys to their own temporary
use and speculate with them: directors
make advances to eacli other of depositors’
funds ; one confederate buys property from
another at a fictitious value and passes it off
with the help of a third robber to the financial
institution which the two latter control, and
after awhile it is split up and mixed with other
deals and partly realised upon till it becomes
untraceable, and no one can tell whether the
deal ended in a profit or a loss. It is during
such good times that the enterprising cashier
abstracts a roll of notes and pulls off a venture
and goes on speculating and presently finds he
has done so well that the original sum is of no
consideration, and he replaces it. It is then
that the large-hearted and enterprising adven-
turers go through the same performance with
all the funds they have access to, and emerge
from the transaction with big bank-balances,
and parcels of title-deeds truly and really their
own, and maintain on perfectly safe and solid
ground the swaggering ostentation and display
of wealth and public spirit and piety which at
the outset were but part of the machinery of
their swindle. During these epochs of financial
buoyancy and progressive innation the victim
who has had a property palmed off on him at a
dishonest increase on its productive value gets
over his first burst of indignation very promptly
when he perceives that he will be able to pass it
on to somebody else at still a larger imposition.
He is like too many people when they find that
a bad half-crown or a forged note has been
played upon them. If they can get rid of these
in making a purchase, they are content to avoid
the trouble of prosecuting the original criminal.
Thus, when times are good, most people are
gaining wealth, or at any rate believe that they
are, although what they mistake for substance
is frequently mere shadow. If a man is hit in one
transaction he in turn hits in several others, and
cannot conveniently display acrimony, because
somebody else has dealt with him just as he
has treated other persons. As for the honesty
of the transactions which take place, that is a
consideration which, if people troubled them-'
selves about it, would be too apt to trammel
them in their operations. The jubilant, pros-
perous crowd rushes over the carcases of those
who have slipped, and drowns their cries with a
chorus of delight. Very few men have the
moral fibre which would enable them to resist
the impulse of example. The delirium infects all
sorts and conditions of men, till the turmoil of
speculation resembles a witches’ sabbath.
• • *
It may be opposed to this description that it
supposes an entire suspension—if not an utter
negation—of commercial morality and common
honesty. These be line phrases indeed ; but
have they any actual meaning ? Is honesty so
common ? Does commercial morality exist ? If
honesty be common, why arc promissory-notes
and written receipts universally demanded ? If
commercial morality exists, where is its abiding
place ? Is it commercially moral to label the
worst quality of goods “ best,” and reserve the
terms “superior ” and “superfine ” to indicate
better grades ? Is it commercially moral to
style a pint-aud-a-half bottle a quart ? Is it
commercially moral to announce that articles
are for sale at less than cost price when they
carry a substantial profit ? Was it commercially
moral for Rothschild, of London, to buy British
Funded Stocks after Waterloo when in ex-
clusive possession of the intelligence that
Napoleon was crushed? Is it commercially moral
to deal, with a knowledge that your gain could
only be achieved by another’s ruin ? If so, what is
there that commercial morality prohibits? Is it
commercially moral to gamble in stocks and
shares, even without exclusive intelligence? If
so, then it is commercial morality to gamble,
which is immoral when considered without
relation to commercial ethics. That is to say,
that which is wrong per se is not wrong when
judged by commercial canons. When, there-
fore, a poor devil of a speculator, clutching and
clinging to anything within his reach which
seems likely to enable him to climb to affluence
and social consideration, sees enthroned in
blissful and reposeful dignity magnates who,
he knows, scrambled up by the very methods
which he is employing, what is there to remind
and warn him that those methods are not
merely dishonest, but actually criminal in the
eye of the law, when that eye happens to open ?
* » *
It is very hard upon men of enterprise and
courage when they fall upon the evil times of a
protracted depression, and so many would-be
climbers slip and hurt themselves that the
clamour of shrieks and groans disturbs the
torpidity of Justice and excites her to the point
of raising for a moment the customary bandage
from her eyes. And it must be peculiarly
aggravating to them for Justice to assume an
air of surprise and virtuous indignation at the
spectacle presented at the moment, and to
begin to lay about her with her sword. It
must seem very cruel to the thieves and rogues,
and more especially when they know that
among the crowd who shriek to Justice to
smite and spare not are numbers of indi-
viduals who only lacked the vigour or
the chance of doing as they have done.
But, none the less, the catastrophe has
peculiar charms for the few who had recognised
the opportunities for plunder all along, who
had felt themselves strong enough to seize upon
them, and capable of carrying them through,
and who, while resenting the swagger of the
thieves bedecked in the trophies of their raids,
and smarting under the comparative neglect to
which their own insignificant equipment exposed
them, scorned to seek consideration at such a
price, and resisted the temptation of the times.
To such it must appear that periods of depres-
sion are not without their consolations, and not
devoid of genuine advantage to the entire com-
munity. When rogues arc brought to grief,
honest men have some chance of meeting with
appreciation and, possibly, of material pros-
perity.
The Abolition of Debt.
A few {days ago a deputation waited on the
New South Wales Minister of Education to
point out that the Civil servant is a privileged
individual who is, in many cases, practically
impervious to his creditors, and asked that some
alteration should be made in the law, so as to
reduce this gaudy, high-collared potentate to
the level of ordinary humanity. The male
person who is not a householder but a mere
lodger or denizen of a boarding-house, as is the
case with a large proportion of Civil servants,
is practically not subject to the statute of dis-
traint. His moveables cannot be seized in satis-
faction of his debts, and for some unexplained
reason his salary cannot be attached like that
of a common mortal. Therefore his creditors
have practically no redress against him, and in
a large number of instances he lives on confiding
grocers, and tailors, and old women wiio keep
boarding-houses, and on everybody else who
chances to be of a trustful disposition. Also,
he lives on many others who are not trustful,
but who give credit simply because the vicious
system of credit has eaten into the soul of the
nation, and the tradesman has either to trust
customers who, he well knows, will seldom pay
if they can possibly avoid it, or else do no busi-
ness at all. This vision of bad debts and unpaid
billssomoved Minister SuTTOßthat he ultimately
promised to do something, the nature of which
was not definitely specified, to put the Civil
servant on the same level as the rest of the
nation. Whether he proposes to effect this by
making the debts of this privileged class re-
coverable in the ordinary fashion, or whether
he intends to make the debts of the whole
population equally irrecoverable, is a subject
for conjecture. The Bulletin devoutly hopes,
for many reasons, that he will move in the
direction of adopting the latter course.
» # •
The abolition of debt would be an unmixed
blessing to humanity, and the shortest road
towards abolition is to make all monetary
obligations—save those fraudulently incurred—
irrecoverable by any legal process whatsoever.
A debt is an amount which one man hopes,
contrary to all reason and in defiance of common-
sense, that another man will liquidate at some
more or less indefinite period, and if it becomes
a matter of certainty that nobody ever will
liquidate, then, for all practical purposes, debt
is abolished. Credit and faith are very closely
allied; faith is the art of believing things which
the believer knows are not true, and credit is
the mystery of waiting for money which the
creditor knows will never come. It is also an
enlarged form of the old, familiar “ confidence-
trick,” which latter device, for some unex-
plained reason, the law refuses to regard as
credit, and defines instead as crime. The
“ confidence-man ” lives by inducing his victim
to wait while he walks round the comer
with his purse, and, in most cases, the vijtim
is still waiting, and the confidence - nia
has not come back ; the successful deb to
induces some tradesman to wait while lie g oe
round the corner with his unpaid-for goods
and the tradesman, like the other victim ts
still waiting. There is such a striking similarity
between credit and crime, that the one wants to
be extinguished as badly as the other. 11( i
wlien debts are made irrecoverable one of tliese
twin evils will be extinguished. There are
possibly some men in Australia who would
pay their liabilities without compulsion
and purely as a matter of conscience ; but ti levr
are so very small a proportion that they need
not be taken into consideration. With the
great mass credit, under the new regime, wouldl
be merely a giving away of valuable property
without any compensation, and therefore it
would become as moribund as charity, which
has to a great extent been replaced by that
Christian virtue which is embodied in a hungry
longing for bold advertisement.
* * *
With the extinction of credit, bankruptcy
would become a thing of the past, and the great
art of whitewashing and the mystery of paying
IChjd. in the £ would sink into oblivion. Also
the science of cooking the accounts and keeping
fraudulent ledgers would perish, for the chief
object of cooking the accounts is to get other
people’s money on deficient security, and as no
one would then get other people’s money under
any circumstances, there would no longer be any
purpose in the business ; and the principal
motive for fraudulent ledgers is to deceive
the fraudulent individual’s creditors, therefore,
when he was unable to acquire creditors, the
proceeding would be mere gratuitous foolish-
ness. Also the bogus-bank industry would die
a natural death, for these institutions live by
owing money, and under a better system no one
would have the opportunity to owe money ; and
the “legitimate” banks would ultimately die
in like manner, which would not be a subject
for serious regret, as the chief difference be-
tween the bank that is legitimate and that
which is not legitimate is that the one is burst
and the other is not. Further, usury would
shrivel up like a worm in Tophet, for the prin-
cipal and the 100 per shent would be equally
irrecoverable ; and at least half the trade that,
now exists—the half which the world does not,
want—would be wiped out, and commerce:
would be reduced to the limits of actual neces-
sity. And, in addition to all this, three-fourths;
of the classes which produce nothing but
merely live upon the producer—the middle-
men, brokers, agents, bill-discounters, the stock-
exchange “ bulls ” and “ bears,” the people
who make advances on mortgage, the bill of-
sale monstrosities, and a large proportion of ike
shopkeepers, of whom there are now at least
three times as many as are really essential—
would vanish ; and the great joint-stock system
would all but disappear, for the debenture-
holders and depositors’ money, which is gener-
ally irrecoverable as a matter of reality, would
become entirely so as a matter of law. Consider-
ing that about 75 per cent, of joint-stock enter-
prises are mere graves for the savings of a de
hided public tins latter result would cause no
special lamentation except among promoters,
“guinea-pig” directors, and other sharks of
the same order. The banking industry—so
much of it as is really necessary—the insurance
business, and the like, would become State
monopolies ; and private enterprise would pre-
sently fill the place which is now occupied by
syndicates and corporations.
# ' # #
When the State ceased to recognise private
debts it would naturally cease, at the same:
time, to recognise written evidences or acknow-
ledgments of debt. It could not logically do-
otherwise ; when debt is not recognised it prac-
tically ceases to be, and the written evidence of
the existence of that which is non-existent is
an obvious anomaly. Therefore, bills, promis-
sory-notes, mortgages, bills-of-sale, debentures,
and the like would become waste paper, and
the only recognised obligations would be those
of the State. These must necessarily remain
in force, for the State is the people, and the
State’s internal liabilities are the liabilities of
the people to the people—the debt which each
citizen owes to himself and to no one else. In
every other sense the nation would be reduced
in one act to a cash basis. The art of living
beyond one’s means would become extinct, for
no one could live beyond his means except by
open robbery, which would promptly land him
in gaol. The still greater art of living with-
out means, which is merely credit in
its highest state of development, would
go the same road. There would be a stupendous
curtailment of that comprehensive thing gene-
rally described as “commercial enterprise,” and
humanity would reap much benefit thereby, for
“commercial enterprise” consists almost en-
tirely of borrowed money, bills, debentures,
lies, commissions and percentages, of gathering
in the fruits of other men’s labours, of “jump-
ing the claim” of the worker and “freezing
out ” the inventor, and perpetrating huge land-
steals and promiscuous robberies. There would
be the greatest wiping out that the world has
yet seen of the classes which neither toil nor
spin, bub which live luxuriously upon the
toilers. There would be an end to the curse of
interest, because interest, like other debts,
would cease to be recoverable, and Capitalism
would thereupon begin to flicker out. And the
change would, even in a strictly legal sense,
undo a great injustice and right a great wrong.
Credit is given because the Law undertakes to
protect the creditor, yet it fails so utterly to do
so that no man with reasonable capacity and a
thorough knowledge of legal intricacies need
pay anybody unless he feels so inclined. If the
Law will cease this vain pretence and admit its
own impotence, the evil will die out of its own
accord.
# * #
The great obstacle in the way of this much-
needed reform is that the Anglo-Saxon, like the
Hebrew, has a superstitious reverence for the
science of creating debts. When depression!
settles down heavily upon the nation his lament
is that Credit is at a low ebb ; when prosperity
returns he whoops because Credit has been
restored. The word, whether used in this wide
and general sense or restricted to its narrowest
signification, amounts to exactly the same
thing. When the periodical boom arrives in the-


land it means that every importer is buying
* ea t quantities of goods that are not paid for,
® I i s selling them and not getting the money
1 that a large number of property-holders arc
1 rrovving money from banks and syndicates on
the security of their freeholds and that the
Irinks are borrowing large sums from their
lepositors to supply this demand—-that specu-
lators are purchasing estates on bills and selling
them in small allotments in the same fashion—
that all sorts of companies are borrowing money
from the nation at large, in order to do all manner
(l f things more or less impossible —in short, that
there is a general outburst of debt, and a tem-
porary madness, in which everybody has a
profound faith in the value of everybody else’s
p at three mouths. All this is described as
(Jredit, or occasionally—for the sake of euphony
and to avoid much damnable iteration-—as the
return of Confidence. The depression which
ensues means that the universal P.N. has been
dishonoured, that the child like confidence of
the nation has been entirely misplaced, and
that the great outbreak of credit has be-
come a bad debt. Up to date, every boom
in all the world’s history has burst, except
one or two of very recent date which will burst
shortly ; and every time the world has exhibited
that quality which is described, in a commercial
sense, as “Confidence” it has been defrauded
as the immediate result. And yet the press to-
day prays for the restoration of Confidence as
fervently as ever, and trusts that Credit will
presently be restored. After so many centuries
of experience it is strange that these well-worn
cant phrases should still pass muster. The
world does not want credit to be restored any
more than it does cholera ; a thing that under-
goes restoration every few years and which
immediately afterwards falls again more heavily
than ever might as well be left prostrate.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Caucasian—Played Out?
There is something seriously wrong with the
Australian white man. While business has
been going from bad to worse during the past
seven years or so, while employment has become
constantly harder and harder to procure, and
small shopkeepers have been going under in
shoals, while farmers have been moaning over
their inability to keep their heads above water,
thousands of men of alleged inferior races have
been prospering to an extraordinary extent. In
Sydney the vegetable-market on Saturday
morning early is a sight, once seen, never for-
gotten. The Corporation sheds are crammed
with carts heaped up with produce—about 400
of them —and every cart belongs to a Chinaman
who wholesales to a crowd of white green-
grocers and hawkers. An excursion round
Botany, Cook’s River, and even as far on the
other side as Manly Yale, shows all the best
bits of land—best because they have been made
best—in the hands of Chinamen. There are
just exceptions enough—a few white market-
gardeners steadily pegging away—to show that
it is not absence of profit which throws the
business into the Chinkies’ hands. Then, again,
the Mongolian has been, and is, steadily oust-
ing the white shopkeeper from the streets lead-
ing from Belmore Park citywards. During the
same period, while the numbers of the Austra-
lian unemployed have been constantly growing,
hundreds of new-chum Levantines, .Sicilians,
Neapolitans, and Maltese have come out to New
South Wales and found a living as fishermen
and fishshop-keepers. These gentry have begun
to seize upon the oyster-room business. And
it is just since “the depression” began that
Italians and Sicilians have all but monopolised
the fruit-selling business, having opened hun-
dreds of shops in Sydney and suburbs. The
bush settlements are being levied upon by
Indian hawkers, and lately some Greeks or
Bulgarians have commenced a really formidable
onslaught on the lolly-trade. It is useless to
explain away this victory of immigrants over
Australians by alleging, as is usually done, that
the former “live on the smell of an oily rag.”
They don’t sell their wares at the price of
oily rags. John Chinaman by no means
gives away his vegetables, and fish is not
a drug in the market since the Italians com-
menced business as catchers and sellers. As
regards the fruit shops, choice sorts are as dear
as ever. But the show-windows are attractively
dressed, and the shops themselves tidy, which
is more than the small fruit shops run by
“ white ” men and women can boast, as a
general rule. Another formidable invasion of
industry is in progress, the Chinamen having
now begun to assail the regular farming busi-
ness. They have obtained possession of the
pick of the flats round Tamworth and have
commenced the fodder trade, sending down
by rail compressed hay, lucerne, and so forth.
1 hen in the mining industry they are scattered
over a lot of country, delving at alluvial gold
nnd tin. The Indian hawkers don’t content
themselves with misery gains either. One of
them in a New England district “ goes on the
mrst ” as regularly as if he belonged to the
superior race, and knocks down a respectable
cheque every six months or so, and on recover-

Subsidising l the Silver Companies.
The New South Wales Government has granted
16 s^vei '' n) ining companies of Broken Hil[
other month’s suspension of the labour con-
tl ~ ons un der which their leases are held. After
t. Y* e Pretence of maintaining a neutral atti-
a«? 'ad better be altogether dropped ;it was
I, e , r y pretence at the best, and of late it
r ” e come so miserably attenuated that what
Dins of it isn’t worth keeping. When any-
body preserves an attitude of neutrality between
two combatants, according to any reasonable
interpretation of the term, he simply regards
their differences as non-existent, and as the
Minister of Mines has granted certain con-
cessions to one party because of these
differences the alleged neutrality is exploded
in one act. Moreover, these concessions are
all on one side. The State has a contract with
both parties, as it has with every individual in
the community, which contract, by the way, con-
sists chiefly in the payment of taxes and other
obligations in return for the more or less
dubious blessing of living in a civilised land,
it has relaxed its contract with the companies
without exacting anything in return—in other
words, it has made them a present of a valuable
concession solely because they have chosen to
break their arbitration agreement; while its
contract with the men is enforced as
rigidly as ever. The only palpable advan-
tages enjoyed by the latter class con-
sist in making contributions to the revenue
by means of customs and excise duties, and
these haven’t been relaxed one inch in consider-
ation of the distressed condition of the miners.
The Government, in fact, is deliberately fur-
nishing the sinews of war to the mine-owners.
The one thing which the miners want to ensure
their success is money ; the one essential of the
companies is time. They are not losing their
dividends, but only postponing them. The
mines won’t melt away through much waiting ;
money dissolves, but time, so far as any
palpable evidence shows, goes on for ever. If
the mine-owners are allowed time enough, their
victory is absolutely certain, and the State is
giving them what they want in large quantities.
If it assumed the absolutely neutral position on
which it prides itself so needlessly, then for
every month’s suspension which it allows to the
employers, it would contribute a month’s strike-
pay to the employes, but evidently the Cabinet
is so saturated with capitalistic prejudice that
this view never even dawned upon the remotest
horizon of its intelligence. In fact, it would
seem that it is really not aware of its own bias ;
it is giving enormous subsidies to help one party
in carrying on the conflict, and it doesn’t even
know the meaning of its own act. The present
New South Wales Cabinet is better than any
of its predecessors for one reason—it thinks
that it is more or less democratic, while those
that went before knew that they were not
democratic, and had no desire to be so; but at
the same time its attempts to deal out even-
handed justice to all sections of the community
are a woeful failure. Like most Governments,
it is out of practice ; it is so long since it has
seen anything even distantly resembling even-
handed justice that it fails to recognise the
article.
Hi! Hi! Hi!
Parkes has decided to play a lone hand in the
ensuing session of New South Wales Parlia-
ment. His decision is plainly voiced in his
recent address at St. Leonards. He intimates
to the able men on his side that he aspires to be
the Great lAm again. His speech reads like a
trumpet-call to the Sydney Smiths, Jacob
Garrards, Jimmy Inglises, and other medio-
crities in the political arena to withdraw their
allegiance from G. H. Reid, and to so work as
to deserve a portfolio in a Parkes Govern-
ment. With the solitary exception of the last
administration, in which M'Millan and Bruce
Smith at least shared power with Parkes,
every Parkes Cabinet has been of a one-horse
description. No more strong colleagues for
Parkes ! Mark his language at St. Leonards:—
I will never surrender my freedom again to any set of
men whatever, or in other words I will never take upon
myself special burdens unless I can associate myself with
men who believe as I believe and whose opinions are as
mine, and who will act with me loyally as one man.
The set of men for whom Parkes is casting his
net were represented on his platform by
“ Tannery ” Davies, Tommy Ewing, ex-parson
Cullen, importers Martin and Riley,
“Nancy” Cullen, and Single-taxers Kindle
and E. M. Clarke. Not one of his late
colleagues turned up to hear the “ Australian—
Parkesian?—Policy of the Future.” Although
Parkes wrote to many old supporters and to
some intending candidates at next election he
could only command the support of the above-
mentioned individuals. Yet he intends to make
another bid for office, and is quite ready to lick
the hand that smote him. He relies on the
Labour-party for his majority. He purposes to
resurrect the Commonwealth Bill, and to gain
the sympathy of the Labour-members with a
gushing address on the Black-labour question.
The “old parliamentary hand” needs to be
watched very closely or he will dish the men
whom he denounced once in scornful tones as
“that set of persons calling themselves the
Labour-party.”

Settling’ the People on the Land.
It is one of the recognised axioms, or rather
one of the time-worn cant expressions, of every
politician that the people require “ to be settled
on the land ” in order to create prosperity in
the distressful country of Australia. Whenever
these provinces are a little more hard-up than
usual the ancient wheeze is trotted out, and
then a big land-sale, or a series of land-sales, is
held with this end in view. Generally the land
is bought, not by genuine settlers, but by big
squatters or speculators, and by the agents of
British absentees, but, as a rule, a few lots are
disposed of to bond fide agriculturists, and the
settlement of the people on the land is under-
stood to be progressing favourably. All the
same, settlement never seems to get very much
further advanced, as the melancholy list of
bankrupt selectors in almost every daily paper
Avill testify. The selector is usually ignorant,
sanguine, and unbusiness-like. The object of
everybody with whom he does business is to
give him credit —for the sake of doing business
—so long as his little farm is sufficient security
for his debts, and to sell him up afterwards to
recover the money ; and as the average human
being has an incurable tendency to take all the
credit he can get, regardless of consequences,
the selling-up process goes on gaily. Then the
little selection is traded off to some already
overgrown landowner, and another “ unem-
ployed’’drifts inapurposeless fashion to theover-
crowded city, and another big estate is created to
be an incubus upon the nation. The process of
settling an agricultural population on the land
will never begin in real earnest until it is
enacted that on every holding the homestead,
and a certain proportion of the land—say 100
acres—sufficient to support the selector and his
family in reasonable comfort, shall be absolutely
exempt from seizure by creditors under any
circumstances whatsoever. Whether the land
is freehold or held under lease from the Btate,
this system ought equally to apply. It would
involve no injustice to the creditors, as it would
merely limit the extent to which credit would
be granted. At present the storekeeper, the
stock-salesman, and everybody else with whom
the selector has dealings allows him to incur
debts just so far as they are certain of
recouping themselves by the sale of his house
and Ids furniture and his 640 acres ; under
a more equitable system they would do so
only as far as they could recoup themselves
by the seizure of 540 acres—the house and
furniture and the balance of the land being
exempt. And, as a further extension of lids
system, it would be a wise and statesmanlike
proceeding if furniture up to a limit of, say, £lOO,
and house-property—in "the personal occupation
of the debtor—to, say, twice that value, were
exempted in like manner under all circum-
stances.
David Same’s mission to England was to hunt
after railway expert evidence wherewith to
fight Speight’s action against the Age. Poor
Dicky will have to wait until February 1 for
the return of a “ commission,” which Same
swears is indispensable to his case, and Speight
“believes” to have been applied for “ solely
for the purpose of delay.’ Whether or no, the
six months postponement was granted by Judge
Hodges, so, presumably, a number of men in
England, all of them more or less acquainted
with Speight, will be requested to say that he
mismanaged a railway system of which they
know nothing at all. If they be prepared to
give evidence unfavourable to Speight, which
seems absurdly unlikely, and the verdict of an
Australian jury should be affected by it, then
Speight, one supposes, would get an order for
a new trial on the ground that said evidence
was wrongfully admitted, or something.
And if the Age come to grief then
David Same, perhaps, will get a new trial
for the reason that he is prepared to pay for
one, no Judge being disposed to refuse any
application that tends towards a further fatten-
ing of the legal vultures. There are many
European countries, not to mention America
and the far East, where David Same can take
out commissions, and long before he has
exhausted the expert evidence of the world he
will be dead and far beyond earthly damages.
Also Speight will be dead and most of the wit-
nesses gone for ever. This is a somewhat
melancholy look-out for the ex-railway-man,
who, seeking redress for an alleged grievance
against the Age, is already commencing to dis-
cover that his most real grievance anyway is
against the Law.
The faults of Speight’s railway management
may have been many, and the Victorian Govern-
ment may have done well to dispose of that
once be-patted autocrat, but the alleged con-
tempt with which he received some of Minister
Wheeler’s wild ideas has now been thoroughly
justified, anyhow. It was demanded of Speight
that he should draw up a scheme for increasing
the railway receipts by £150,000 a year, and
when he refused to admit the possibility of so
doing, and indirectly hinted that Wheeler
didn’t know what he was talking about, the
Government got rid of Speight on account of
his “incapacity,” “ intractability,” and general
no-goodness. Y et last week Wheeler actually
took credit for the fact that under new manage-
ment the railway receipts for the quarter ending
Aug. 4 were only £36,000 lefts than for the cor-
responding three months of last year! Wheeler
has raised the fares and given that part of his
system a fair trial, and his receipts have
decreased to the same amount that Speight
was asked to increase them by.
New South Wales Executive is worried about
the revision of the Commission of the Peace,
and suggestions have been made that a new
system should be adopted, the most inconse-
quential of the mooted proposals being that
“ the Judges of the Supreme Court, assisted by
the Under-Secretary for Justice and the
Principal Under-Secretary might be constituted
a Permanent Commission to periodically revise
the roll of the unpaid magistracy.” The one
great desideratum is to obtain impartial and
non-political Justices. Taking the case of any
likely Justice, resident in a distant country
district, the Judges and the two Under-
secretaries alluded to can have no special means
of information concerning his integrity, his
political views, the estimation in which he is
held by his fellow-citizens, and his fitness to
administer justice; therefore, there is no
natural reason why the selection of Js.P. should
be placed in their hands. It is highly probable,
in fact, that such a Commission would assess
a man’s qualities by the extent of his
acres, or the swollen aspect of his bank-
book, besides that very doubtful appurten-
ance known as his “ social status in which
eventuality, the Commission of the Peace
would necessarily include all the violent parti-
sans of Property, and would more than ever
interpret the law in favour of the rich, the fat,
and the gorgeously-waistcoated, and to the
increased detriment of the poor, molcskinned,
landless and unpropertied. The trend of the
democracy is towards the popular election of
magistrates, ay, and even of judges. The
democracy is logically held to prescribe its own
laws, and it is but a legitimate extension of the
democratic principle that the people themselves
should interpret those laws by appointing their
own legal administrators. The people of any
district may fairly be trusted to elect as magis-
trates, only such fellow-citizens as have honour-
ably earned public confidence.
The N.Q. station-manager who, on 3rd June
last, with the aid of his man, is averred
to have kidnapped a girl picaninny from
Boulia, and carried her off 100 miles before he
was captured by a constable, is an aristocrat
with influence. The police-court evidence
was distinct as to abduction, as to the girl
being tied up o’ nights to trees with saddle-
straps, as to her being beaten, and as to her
being rigged out in boy’s clothes and styled
“ Bob.” The Boulia residents became cognisant
of the affair, because the girl’s mother, a
domesticated darkey, after the manner of
her tribe, lamented her child’s loss by powder-
ing her hair with lime and by howling loud
lamentations. The two men were committed
for trial. Since then, the Queensland press has
been remarkably dumb about the affair. The
case has progressed curiously. It has been
postponed for six months, the bail has been
reduced from £lOO and two sureties of £lOO to
£4O and two sureties of £4O, and the Crown
Prosecutor at Win ton (to which court the pair
were committed) has altered the charge from
child-stealing to “common assault.” By the
time the six months’ extension has expired, the
mother-gin may be dead or missing, or some-
thing. What in Somebody is a gentle skylark,
in the man of moleskins would be a case of
“ bail refused.”
The artless protest of a manufacturer comes
from the columns of the Argus, which, like the
gates of a certain “little church around the
corner,” are ever open unto sorrow—of a parti-
cular brand. The distressful firm shrieks thus :
“ As to ourselves, we have constantly declined
to join in the cry of some mantle and under-
clothing manufacturers for higher duties,
because we are convinced that the higher duties
will cause more factories to be started .” Then,
by way of seeming unselfish, this far-seeing
firm assures the Argus that the result of com-
petition will be an excessive output, and less
constant employment for the poor girls who
work at “starvation wages.” The concern
shown for the welfare of the girls is beautiful,
but quite extraneous to the great commercial
fact that as soon as there are too many factories
some of them will have to smash up, and if the
firm under discussion should happen to be one
of the unfortunates it must try to find comfort
in the thought that the fittest underclothing
has survived.
Parkes, iu poetic ecstacy : ‘ ‘ Tasmania, that
isle of wealth and beauty,” “ Victoria, with her
impassioned spirit and radiant crown,” “South
Australia, with her golden wheatfields and her
vineyards,” “ Queensland, with her sunny
fields and countless herds,” New South Wales,
“ the august mother, who is the mother of all.”
Catchpenny jam to ensure widespread Press
quotation ! The “ isle of wealth and beauty ”
is so ‘ ‘ dead-broke ” that it wants to sack its
Governor in order to save his salary. The land
of “ impassioned spirit and radiant crown” is
extra-taxing its ardent spirits in order to raise
another half-crown or so. The country of
“ golden wheatfields” imported a lot of its last
year’s wheat from the “ impassioned spirit.”
The “ sunny fields ” of Queensland are mosaics
of dense jungle and drought-cracked wilder-
ness in the mudpans of which periodically rot
the skeletons of “ countless herds,” while thou-
sands of disgusted toilers are preparing to
emigrate to Argentina. The poet thoughtfully
left West Australia alone ; that province has
few voters, and not enough newspapers to be
worth mentioning.
Government diamond-drills have proved the
existence of a gutter 650 ft. wide in the Eastern
Plateau, Ballarat. Splendid samples were
obtained from the last core. The gutter is at a
workable depth, 211 ft., that is on the high reef
and above the underground sea which is the
bane of Ballarat. Supporters of mines-
nationalisation should not forget that the
machinery used in prospecting this ground is
State property, and the wages of the pros-
pectors are paid out of the Treasury ; but that
splendid 650 ft. gutter is all under the thumb of
the big grabbers, and if it benefits the people
at all will only do so to the extent of providing
competition wages to miners for the regulation
“hard graft.” If the State can prospect for
the benefit of paunchy syndicates, it can surety
work the drills with a view to appropriating for
the general good any creamy thing they happen
upon.
Queensland, on the eve of the desperate and
fateful battle in which all democratic Aus-
tralians must take a part, can ill-spare the
virile white brain, bone and sinew which pro-
poses to emigrate to the 416,0CX) acres of land
placed at the disposal of the new Australian
Co-operative Association by the Argentine
(S. Amer.) Government. To any patriotic
Australian mind, it savours of cowardice to
thus desert a land the ultimate destiny of which
—whether through peaceful legislation or
through fiery and bloody ordeal—is white,
democratic freedom and the complete emanci-
pation of labour. Yet these eager spirits,
desirous of tasting even far away from our
country, under the shadow of the Andes, the
possibilities of full freedom for themselves, and
not content to merely pave the way for their
posterity, have much excuse iu the shameful
betrayal of their manhood rights by Judas
politicians, the abominable tyranny of the
usurping classes, and the meek submission to
existing wrongs of weaker-fibred men who
abjectly kiss the rod.
Bishop Goe, at the recent annual meeting of
Melbourne Charity Organisation Society ;
Labour is a commodity, and no sympathy should be
extended to those persons who appeal to the charity of
the public after having refused lower wages than those
asked tor.
It is painful to witness the humiliating spectacle
of a self-appointed teacher of ethics, whose in-
excusable deficiency in the rudiments of know-
ledge permits the inane observation that labour
is a commodity, and of no more earthly con-
sideration than a pound of grease, which is
siting about the market at the mercy of the
highest bidder. If this be so, then Goe himself
is merely a lump of inanimate matter, filling up
a vacancy in the clerical department of Mel-
bourne, whose location is dependent on the
market price offered for his services by rival
parishioners, and whose salary should be deter-
minable solely by the fluctuating receipts of the
offertory-box ! And yet, the other day, the
abolition of State endowment of religious super-
stitious, as a supplement to fixed stipends, was
roundly abused by the Holy Church of England!


Mis. Beeton says: “Claret should be
sound, fruity, and soft as satin, and all the com-
ponents happily blended into a homogeneous
whole. Easy of digestion, it is a mildly stimu-
lating drink, in every way fulfilling the Scriptural
character as a ‘ wine that maketh glad the heart
of man.’” Innes’s Boar’s Hoad Clarets, at all

no recommended as purer and belter wines than

SIC Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 17,1892,
Alv Dear Moorabinda,—
A certain lady-doctor, Kate Bushnell, is coming on a
\isit to Australia, “specially commissioned to arouse
interest in the social purity department.’’ Her mission
is sure to succeed. There’s lots of interest taken in the
dubious reports of “ Bible women ” (Zola may take a back
seat when such a damsel, fresh from the Chinese quarter,
has the floor) and other slum-haunting females, and the
open-mouthed hearing anybody can get who sighs spicily
over “ our fallen sisters " at a “ ladies’ only ” must be
very encouraging to the missionary.
And yet some of the very same sympathetic set think it
no shame to turn the fault of the “ sister” into a personal
economy. Isn’t this familiar and piteous enough—
“ Strong girl with quiet child, as general servant.
Moderate wages? ” “ Moderate ” wages as a penalty for
her sin against society ! Many respectable matrons don’t
hesitate to hold out a helping hand to the “unfortunate
girl —but it’s half-price help. lam told of one lady
saint who for years and years has not paid more than five
shillings a week for “ service.’’
I wonder, by the way, where the social purity doetress
considers her mission begins and ends in Australia ? Is
she only coming to make rows of foolish servants wriggle
as she denounces their every-day pleasures in a voice of
thunder—or will she carry her crusade all along the line ?
Social purity isn’t only a long-felt want in the back
streets, yet that’s where your Daniel-come-to-Judgment
almost always sticks. It would be rather a lark if this
latest reformer commenced leaving her startling pam-
phlets, with their exceedingly rude headings, on the
silver salvers of society’s butlers.
Sydney’Varsity Dramatic Society burst forth again at
the Royal Standard on 11th inst., in an ancient chestnut,
“Angry Wives of Abington.” One pretty thing to be said
of the U. D.S.—they never produce the hackneyed. Even
if the odd dramatic lumber they root out is sometimes
hardly worth the putting up, it's always unfamiliar. And,
barring a tendency to over-much blank-verse and un-
limited tights, which makes the society seem all feet and
calf, the censor who chooses their trouble for them seems
to understand that the world is very weary of “Box and
Cox.”
Two really pretty sketches were pretty Miss Pickburn’s
Dick Coombes (a good make-up, too) and Mr. Jones’s
Hodge, especially in the drunken scene and the airy
laugh—indeed, one could have wished for more Hodge and
less of a beautiful youth with pink legs and his eyes
painted who struck attitudes with tears in his voice and
was a bore. There was a crowded, bare-shouldered
audience which seemed to enjoy everything save the
overture and the limelight.
For the all-round success of their last effort. Mr. Charles
Burford, who coached them, is to be congratulated, and I
was glad he got an enthusiastic call. Of course, the coach
couldn’t help the way their hats flew off in moments of
excitement—l don’t know why amateurs don’t use bonnet-
pins. The dressing was period and well done. Miss
Aekman (a clever Mistress Goursey, who got all the
flowers) wore a very taking sage-green velvet dress of the
cut in vogue when Henry VIII. was rampant, trimmed
(the dress, not the monarch) with gold galon and cream
muslin. Miss Roper-Elliott, as Moll Barnes, might have
played Juliet without a dress change, and Miss Inez
Bensusan was picturesquely indignant in Indian red.

A man who advertises his own loveliness is only fit to be
the bridegroom of the wax-works.
How people can be found bold enough to marry per
advertisement is a mystery to me. Fancy taking the
bare word of an utter stranger that he or she is free as
air and settling down with them! I heard a Sydney
literary man evolve a perfect pearl of wisdom anent the
uncertainty of connubiality by advertisement the other
day. Said he: “ The man who advertises for a wife is
generally about as successful as the man who gets
measured for a dog.”
Women are not a bit clubable—l don’t say it in a wrath-
ful spirit. Theideal woman ought not to be—she should
be decidedly home-sweet-home-ish—but there must be a
great crowd of ideal women when you come to think
how invariably ladies’ clubs fall through !
Sydney Ladies’ Club, that mysterious meeting-place of
Sydney’s one hundred (though the roll has dwindled
down to eighty now) is in a tottering condition. There
is a deep hollow in the committee’s reticule, and the last
meeting of members was steeped in financial gloom.
Among the breezy suggestions for raising the wind were
“to raise the entrance and subscribers’ fees, like the
men’s clubs do to give up the rooms and the lift, and
walk bodily into something less distangay ; or to keep on
in the same marble halls and make the members pay in
direct ratio to the amount of gilt on the mouldings.
These were about the happiest.
The committee are retrenching with both hands. Dear
little membresses shaky in their arithmetic, who “really
hadn’t thought about the subscriptions,” have been fired
out with masculine promptness and decision. There is no
“ tick ” anywhere, not even for a cup of tea (“ unlaced”),
and, in short, the pallid and remorseful spectre of N.S.F.
(the club is over a bank, so I may use the letters with a
clear conscience) has taken possession of the ’alls of the
once ’aughty one ’undred which were wont to faint as one
woman at the more idea of anything impecunious gaining
admittance in (he days of not so very long ago.
Considering how the grass grew in the chinks of
bjdney’s tabby club, I don't suppose anybody will miss it
much. When i’t really does absolutely collapse a number
of dogged ladies who felt called upon to be hauled up in
the lift at least once a week and to repose impatiently on
the sofas and be bored with books because the club furni-
ture ought to look as if somebody utilised it—well, these
martyrs can then stop at home and give up pretending
that they can’t buy a pair of gloves without having to
repair to a furnished apartment to “recruit their
strength ” (though really that is where a club is most
useful as a rule) before they go home. Though what’s to
become of the parched member whose innocent glass of
lemonade seems to have come via a brewery, and the
other “ sinking ” lady whose nice cup of tea dispenses an
overproof aroma, I’m sure I can’t guess.
East Sydney Rowing Club ball, at Leigh House, on 12th
inst., was one of the successes of the social season, viewed
from a public ball aspect. The belle was (/ thought) a
brunette in salmon-pink and floating gauze and her hair
seraphically parted in the centre. Yellow silk and much
ruohed yellow chiffon with a necklet of buttercups and a
chaplet of the same flowers was very pretty. A debutante
(niece of the captain of the club) wore white silk ; and a
cream bengaline made very plainly with a berthe of
crushed cream roses was an artistic turn-out. By the
way, the club decorations—crossed sculls draped in blue
and white ribbons—looked very sportimr. They had
buttons on the oars this time, I remarked.
The Imperial Opera House (and “ Jane ”) was for the
first time V.R. on 10th instant with a strip of crimson
carpet lining the gutter as if the management thought
his Ex. might fall in, and the eye-glassed lessee bare-
headed on the pav<s while faint wafts of the National
Anathema came from within—all beautifully arranged.
Gov. Jersey, with four flashing diamond studs in his
military front, and backed up by every remaining member
of his family and a governess in black and blue thrown in,
sat the show out, and the house as well as the housemaid
was interesting.
Lady Innes had on the most poetic confection, which is
what I ever seek. A pale, apricot-coloured silken stuff,
contrasted in an indefinite way with ruby velvet, pearls
for ornaments, and a ruby plush dolman-wrap, trimmed
with gold. The little Jerseys (who wear their straw-
coloured hair in the “Alexandra” fringe, brought in by
the Princess of Wales for her now grown-uo girls, which
induces me to wonder if there won’t be a new fashion for
titled children’s waving locks until another royal she-
infant’s mane grows ?) both wore pale-blue silken frocks,
which set off the Chumley’s blonde beauty to a marvel.
Seriously, though, we ought to give more thought to what
will become our escorts’ complexions than we do. How
often do you see a copper-coloured Edwin accentuated by
Angelina’s green gown ?
Unlike Lady Carington, Lady Jersey never “ hunts ”
with any woman of less social tonnage than herself—you
never see her out with the children’s governess, for
instance. When “M.E.” heads the vice-regal train, if
there are any other women in it, they are governors’
wives, or countesses, or something like that—she never
amuses herself in the company of any stipendiary lady
member of her household. Lord Jersey (who is really one
of the most good-natured men going) often includes one
of the instructrices of his family in the V.R. party to
places of amusement—but it is when his wife isn’t there.
By the way, when the Jerseys were coming to Australia,
all the “Home” papers insisted that Lady J. would be
the popularity of the combination. But, then, this is
Topsy Turvydom, where even the oysters don’t open as it
is their British duty to.
The “North Shore Orphans” gave a “Ladies’ wail—
wailing begins at eight,” the other evening, and I braved
the unknown dangers of the penny-ferry to see if they
were as original as their prospectus. They weren’t. The
“wail” was merely an amateur concert given by the
usual mixture of much-laundried young gentlemen and
their sisters and cousins and aunts—but, what was worse,
there wasn’t one bona-fide orphan in the whole pro-
gramme ! This is what I call attracting attention under
false pretences.
Sydney Women’s Literary Club has renewed its council
—fired out half-a-dozen ladies who thought they were
voted in as queens and law-givers for ever, and set up with
a new lot of arbitrators in a fervent hope that there won’t
be any more "snobbishness.” But if I were on the
council (instead of being a mere humble outsider) I would
fervently hope for less Tom-foolishness in the utterances
of members. For instance, Herbert Spencer was men-
tioned among the club wits, the other day, when a lady
member arose and remarked breathlessly: “ Herbert
Spencer ! I know him. He was a crusty old man. I
don’t see why we should discuss him.” And sat down at
the fourth full stop.
The send-off tl la carte tendered last week at Sydney
Metropole to the gifted Madame Roth, unexcelled among
Australian ladies as a decorative artist, was very sympa-
thetic and successful. lam told that the farew’ell speeches,

after whom I throw a ghostly horse-shoe for luck, left for
England on loth instant.
From the composer, G. de Carlos Rego, I have received
a very melodious and original “ Impromptu in F,” which
is a little three-and-a-half page bit anybody of a musical
habit might easily memorise with gratifying results. For
it’s a joy to the amateur pianist to lie asked “ What’s
that ? ” in an age when everybody seems to be thumping
the same popular gavotte.
The departing vice-regality doesn’t mind showing the
cloven hoof of excessive lack of interest directly it has
shaken off the shackles, does it? For instance the wife
of a recently-vanished vice-regal potentate promised, just
before her departure, a gold medal to a musical society.
The medal was forgotten—packed by mistake perhaps—
but they would certainly discover and send it from the
first port they touched at, etc. The medal hasn’t arrived
yet, however.
I can’t help thinking of comic opera in connection with
this extract from the ordinarily dull and uninteresting
stock-report sometimes :
Fat Calves.—Market very lightly supplied, and prices
very firm indeed for all descriptions, small good quality
calves especially being in good demand and making up to
80s.
Some of the sort I am thinking of make up to twenty
pounds a week. Ask—but no ! I might be torn to pieces
by infuriated damsels.
That was quite a Ouida-ish episode (Ouida’s aristocrats
are always defeating the infuriated populace with one
hand) which occurred at the vice-regally-attended turning
of the first sod of the new Marrickville railway, the other
day—when Mr. Goschen, of the eye-glass, sent a youth
described as a “larrikin” on to his back for getting
between the wind and Lady Jersey’s nobility. It isstaied
that the street character aforesaid, after loudly expressing
his, no doubt, tipsy determination to shake hands with
the “ governess,” advanced to Lady Jersey’s carriage and
held out his grimy fist, with what is described (in the
Kmo) as a “perfectly diabolical leer,” when the valiant
secretary, Goschen, dealt him a scientific blow or shove,
and sent him to grass.
But little Lady Carington’s hired cavaliers knew better
than that. Under their direction the “Governess”
would have shaken hands amiably with that misguided
tough and sent him abroad to chant her praises before
gigantic “pushes” in the wilds of “bricky” Marrick-
ville. After all, it is not such easy work to have the
streets lined with a weeping populace when you depart
from the midst thereof—there is much shaking of un.
savoury hands to be got through before people are trying
to kiss your luggage on the railway-station ; so, perhaps
Lady Carington made a mistake in being the idol of her
“subjects.” And yet you can’t call a Governor, or his
wife, a success if they haven’t got the—aw— hoi polloi by
its grimy ear, can you ?
Yours affectionately,

They have started a Leichhardt (Sydney)

Sydney D. T. points out that the N.S.W.

A ‘cute Sydney bookseller imported 1000
special copies of Shelley’s poems quite recently,
and offered various jaw-waggers 20 per cent, on the
sale of these, if they succeeded in inaugurating a
Shelley boom by means of the centenary demon-
stration. Thus, some of the perfervid Shelleyism
was cold business.

The cable re Sir George Republican Dibbs’
“ damns ” at Chicago and his violent quarrel with
Colonel Campbell—a person of no great account,
who lately visited Australia as special something

Treasurer M‘llwraith (Q.) is so desperately
pushed for money that <£300,000 worth of Treasury
Bills are absolutely going begging in London.
Yet, it is matter of common assertion that the
Q-N. Bank holds a large sum—variously stated at
from £750,000 to “one or two millions”—of
Government money locked up idly in its vaults.
For whose or what benefit?
Dibbs (as per cable) is now going the whole
British hog. He wants a direct trade between
Canada and Australia, rather than between Aus-
tralia and the U.S., not because it will benefit
Australia, but because “it will greatly benefit the
British Empire.” Further, he plumps for a Van-
couver cable because, “being entirely British,” it
“ would be of splendid value in the event of war!”
A bushman, tried at Sydney, N.S.W., last
week, on a charge of having attempted to poison
a squatter named Walmsley, made this eloquent
defence:—“l know no more of the whole thing
nor a blackfeller or a crow. I been in Roosha an’
Proosha an’ Hamburg, where Mister Wamsley
kem from, an’ nother countries, an’ I know more
about Mister Wamsley’a country nor Mister
Wamsley hissolf. I aint no junk of wood.”
Acquitted with eclat.
Yesterday, at a meeting of Sydney mer-
chants, professional and business men, who have
and are interested in wealth and its safe keeping,
it was decided that bogus banks, burglars, and
fires are dangers to civilization which must be
met and faced. Language such as that cabled as
used by Sir G. R. Dibbs, who said he did not care
a damn for America, while he also damned
Chicago, only produced chaos every where except
in the Sydney Safe Deposit. There all is peace.
It is conceded by all win* know Australians
that they are quick to recognise merit and liberal

Mr. 11. J. Samuel’s popular Musical Album pos-
sesses merit: it contains 11 pieces, comprising
songs, music and dances, and is to be purchased at
all the music and book stores for one shilling.
Any one of those pieces, previously referred to, if
printed separately would be worth the money and
more. It shows great enterprise ; the first edition
is guaranteed 10,000 copies, printed by the well
known firm of Marcus and Andrew iri their best
style. The cover is beautifully lithographed in
colours, and is the finest ever produced in Aus-
tralia for a one shilling musical album. Mr.
Samuel has groat faith in the merit of his publica-
tion and in the liberal patronage of the public.

“The Shaughraun,” which opened at Svd

features of interest since it was here last It i
the same age-worn epic, begorra, of that’ down
trodden land where the banshee grows the menW
potato on the tombs of the crumbled monarchs
and the praste always shwims in a sea of whisky’
and the base oppressor seizes the pig for arrears of
rint, and the colleen always triumphs over tic
dirty informer and the attorney in the last act
There is a faint reminiscence of peat-smoke and f
the long-deceased Xing Malachi about the drama-
and its Irish origin can be recognised, even bv a
stone-deaf man, owing to the holy father and the
liquor. It is an open question, however, if this
country is not getting rather weary of the dis-
tinctively Irish drama in all its varieties
The reduced family which used to own all
the great estates of Ballyhooley and the fallen
towers of Macgillicuddy, and the pettifogging
lawyer who has grabbed these properties, and the
priest, and the spy, and the hilarious peasant
with no visible means of support, and the Sas-
senach officer who acts as the representative of
the brutal Saxon, and the wake, and the whisky
and the squireen, and the banshee, and the shilla-
lagh—behold, we have seen them all unto seventy
times seven, and they are very much alike. Also
Irish drama wastes almost all its sympathies over
heroes with long Irish pedigrees, and the indivi-
dual who never had a pedigree is generally used
up either as the attorney or the dirty informer.
In the present instance, the company seems emi-
nently fitted for the contract it has undertaken.
J. F. Sheridan, who, as already mentioned in Tin;
Bulletin, is doing his last and final farewell which
won’t be repeated under any circumstances after
the present week, undertakes Conn, “the
Shaughraun,” and plays the part gaily and reck-
lessly, with a wild abandon and a bottle of whisky
like a brilliant stage Irishman of the olden time!
The squireen is successfully perpetrated by
Charles Brown, the praste by George Dean whose
legs, unfortunately, lack the reverence that ought
to attach to the part, the base informer by that
good old actor, John Hesford, and the English
officer, who does the work of the brutal and
oppressive Saxon, by W. K. Bernard. Also, the
hern with the pedigree which spreads from here to
the confines of the hereafter is undertaken, in a
somewhat patient and lack-lustre manner, by Mr.
Boyle, and the fair and fascinating Grade White-
ford is the colleen—which pretty nearly uses up
the essential characters in an Irish drama. Also,
the two girls whose ancestors used to own the in-
evitable crumbled tower upon the hill are played
by Misses Alice Austin and Fanny Liddiard—
principally by the latter; and the entire company
alludes to Captain Molineaux —the agent of the
brutal oppressor aforesaid-as “Molmewks,”
which raises a serious question of Pronunciation
and leaves it unsettled.

“Dorothy ’ lias been doing gootl business
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) all "the week, but, at
the same time, it hasn't been doing anything in
particular to retrieve its own character. It is full
of pretty melodies which fade away and leave no
fixed recollection behind ; it is splendidly
mounted, and propped up by a high-class com-
pany; and the chorus is good-looking, particularly
about the ankles, and the dialogue is bright and
humorous ; and the verses are execrably common,
and the only time when they are uncommon is
when they are uncommonly execrable. But, by a
blessed dispensation of Providence, hardly any-
body follows the words of an operatic melody, and
through this ignorance “ Dorothy ” is saved. It
has many good points so long as one doesn't follow
the libretto too closely. It is filled with ap ideal
peasantry—the kind of peasantry that lives on
ideal bacon and spiritual grease, and chases a
bright, ethereal swine across a summer landscape,
and owns an {esthetic cow, and is always
curly-headed and dressed in tight silk pants,
and never, by any chance, carries a muddy
shovel or is stupefied with short pipes and beer,
or harassed by the fowls roosting on the bed-post.
There is an English village in it, but the time-
honoured hog isn’t wallowing in the water-supply,
neither is the old, rheumatic Hodge talking to
the paralytic “gaffer” across the hedge. The
agriculturists are all tuneful and voluble, whereas
the real British agriculturist will sit for hours
speechless over a pint pot; and when Ryley
bursts athwart the landscape upborne on those
two sublime extremities which have mashed so
many impressionable females in the past, and will
mash so many more in the future, the audience is
content, and “ Dorothy” is a success. The opera
depends so much on Ryley, in fact, that The
Bulletin is considering the advisability of float-
ing that gentleman into a company, to be called
Ryley’s Legs and Feet (Limited). Capitalists
willing to take a hand in the enterprise are
requested to communicate with this office.

Miss Myra Kemble is running still another
season of “ Dr. Bill ” at Sydney Opera House, and
doing business which is very much worse than she
and the doctor deserve. Considering tlie apparent
impossibility of drawing good audiences at this
pretty little theatre, even with good pieces and a
high-class company, The Bulletin begins to con-
sider it probable that some gory crime lias been
committed on the site of the premises, and that
the bones of the victim are crying aloud for ven-
geance among the foundations. If the present
writer owned the unlucky structure, he would
make a search for those bones, anyhow. The
best features in the present production, apart
from Miss Kemble herself, are Miss Nellie
Mortyne, as the wife of the miserable “Bill,
Miss Ada Leo as tlm glaring theatrical lady in
red, Mr. Clitberow as the drivelling flunkey, and
Miss Alice May, who has nothing to do, but is a
thing of beauty and a joy for evermore. Also,
Mr. 11. Shine has invented a new and particularly
imbecile chuckle. “ The Judge,” a comedy which
has achieved much success in London, will be put
up at this theatre on Saturday, for the first time
in Sydney.

John F. Sheridan takes his very last
benefit at Sydney Garrick, on Saturday night)
•ifter which he will drop a pearly tear and depart
oer mail steamer for distant lands. The bill will
include one act of the “ Colleen Bawn,” one act
of “ Fun on the Bristol,” and an olio. If it isn’t
too late to offer a word of advice, The Bulletin
would urge John to drop the olio into the deep
blue sea with a ton of lead tied round its neck,
and to dynamite the “Colleen,”and give us “Fun
on the Bristol ” just once more in all its beauty as
it was before it degenerated into a minstrel show.
However, it doesn’t matter after all.
Nothing does matter very much in these degenerate
times.

Mrs. Beere and Co. are returning “ home ”
decidedly wiser than when they arrived a few
months ago. They thought to astonish the
natives, but the natives found them an unsatis-
factory crowd, in which three artists towered over
the others, and one of these others, Otho Stuart,
was put upon a pair of stilts to make him look tall
likewise. The attempt to run Mrs. Beere as an
actress with a wide range of characters was not a
success. Parts like Kate Hardcastle, Lady Gay
Spanker, and Lady Teazle are not suited to her at
all and even at her best Mrs. Beere suffered
severely by comparison with the Divine Sarah.
The great Frenchwoman at 50 is stouter and
stronger than ever she was before, whereas Mrs.
B. at little more than 40 is, in all respects, the
worse for wear and tear. Her magnetic power is
nearly used up.

The un-boomed Orlando Harley, the Foil
Co.’s tenor, farewelled in Sydney on Saturday
night at the Bessie Doyle concert. He was in
grand form, and in response to a double encore in
the final part gave a rendering of “ Annie Laurie ”
which will be forever remembered by all who
heard it. For the rest, the concert was made a
success by Miss Doyle’s violin solos, Mrs.
M‘Donald’s ever-welcome singing, and the only
“ Daddy ” Hallewell.

The popular concerts given this week by
the Italian Opera Co. at Sydney Town Hall have
been a howling success all through, and even at
Is. they probably paid better than any other show
now running in the city. Why shouldn’t some-
thing of this kind become a permanent institution ?
Music will always take at cheap Chinese rates—
not otherwise. 4

Money didn’t make “ The Grey Mare ”
go very furiously at Aleibourne Bijou, so after a
run of one week only the Mare, a useful sort of
animal, showing more literary bone than quality,
was turned out to grass. On Saturday the B. B.
Company held themselves up to admiration in
“Engaged,” a purely Gilbertian comedy which,
for tricks that are vain, is peculiar. “ Engaged ”
seems rather more unique to-day than when first
produced. It was a success, which nobody, not
even the author, has tried to imitate, because its
vein of humour is interesting only as a novelty
and may be said to work itself out, for farcical
comedy purposes, in three acts. Instead of draw-
ing caricatures Gilbert created, in this instance, a
set of ordinary people to interpret wildly eccentric
ideas in a seriously mad manner. Similar people
exist in his comic operas, but they are then intro-
duced under extravagant circumstances and are
less seriously ridiculous in themselves. The piece
is brightly performed at the Bijou by the same cast,
or nearly, that filled the bill in Sydney a time back.
Titheradge is not the dry, cynical Cheviot Hill
that H. ,T. Byron (the only popular author,
perhaps, who ever starred in a fashionable rival’s
play) made of the character. Tith. is disposed to
glory in the joke, and to point out the absurdity
of incidents that might appear more ludicrous if
he accepted them as matters of course. However,
Cheviot is a gorgeous success, anyway. He has a
breezy method of opening his arras to woman-
kind and taking five spinsters just as they come,
and when they all arrive at once lie hugs them
with an ardent impartiality that compels respect.
Boueicault is also a meritorious object, although
he comes badly off in the embrace department,
and Brough achieves fame by Ids inhuman readi-
ness to sell Brenda Gibson to the canoodler in chief
for 40s. A man capable of letting that bonnie
Scotch lassie go at such an enormous sacrifice
would have raffled Venus at sixpence a number.
Miss Gibson is really a treat as Afaggie Mac-
Farlane, and slip and Miss Temple and the idyllic
Hilda Spong are jointly suggestive of a beautiful
legend, or classic fable, or some other heavenly
thing that has slipped our memory. It is seldom
that three such nice girls make so much love in
°ne evening, therefore the callous behaviour of
the management in regard to “ Engaged ’ is some-
what aggravating. They will give it but a brief
week of warm, amorous life, seemingly, for on
Saturday they revive “Confusion,” that awful
dramatic misunderstanding founded on a pug-
dog.

“In the Ranks ” is carrying an unlucky
season through to its bitter end at the Princess’s.
George llignold anticipated his departure by
taking a farewell benefit on Saturday last, when a
speculative public were invited to roll up and
secure “souvenirs” varying in value from the
lowly shilling to a pair of golden guineas. An
idea that lasting mementoes of the occasion—such
as china mugs inscribed with George’s initials in
noble Roman characters, or plugs of tobacco, or
pounds of tea would be forthcoming in large
quantities—encouraged a fairly large audience
to roll up accordingly. When each purchaser of a
ticket found that his souvenir was a free pass to
the same part of the house for another night, and
that he had practically bought two goes of “ In
the Ranks ” for the price of one go, a mild sense of
dissatisfaction was developed here and there. The
holders of these free gifts had, however, acquired
the right to sell them on the open market, so dur-
ing the current week the Princess’s is likely to do
a fair amount of extra business on the most
moderate terms possible.

At Melbourne Opera House the joys of
“ Carmen up to Data” will remain available until
to-morrow (Friday) night, after which the iron
gates of that johnnies’ retreat will close with a
solemn clang, and Alice Leatnar will shake her
head at the upper eircles never again. When the
Gaiety crowd return to play some more farewell
season in Melbourne, it will not be at the Opera
House. In the meantime, they have added about
half-an-hour to the original length of “Carmen”
by accepting more encores than seem called for,
and singing—inthecaseof Courtneidge and Addie
Conyers—new ballads of a specially weak and
simple character. Throughout the season an
encore has always been at the mercy of any two
or three boys who gathered themselves together to
clap their hands (like the floods in the Litany) and
the necessary number of boys has generally been
present. Nothing but a burst of dead silence pre-
vents certain artists from coming back to sing
another verse, and when this stillness at last
supervenes, it makes the more judicious look
pensive,

J. C. Williamson begs to announce that
he will resume the direction of the Princess’s on
Saturday, on which occasion Walter Bentley
purposes to appear in the historic boots of Wilfrid
Denver. “The Silver King” is a noble melo-
drama, full of hope and comfort for the boozer
who wastes his substance in backing horses, and
the company engaged to support Bentley will not
be found wanting in the hour of need. Royce,
Sass, George Carey, Hans Phillips, Fabert, and
Miss Henrietta Watson are leading features on
the list.

Under the circumstances, it seems odd that
nobody hires the Royal for a variety show. The
Cogills have been flourishing at St. George’s Hall,
and now that Harry Rickards is about to join
forces with them the combination might fill a
theatre comfortably for a short season. Other
halls and places may expect to feel the benefit of a
heavy reduction in competition, and the circus,
meanwhile, is making a triumphant progress
round the suburbs. Also the Aquarium has
bought another big crocodile and billed him as a
“Bloodthirsty Tyrant.” The beast has a tyrannical
way of lying dormant for 48 hours at a stretch.
Musin’s Concerts were resumed at Mel-
bourne Town Hall on Saturday. This time,
Manager Hughes had the satisfaction of finding
that the charm of the previous performances had
worked, the result being a big attendance and a
frenzied demonstration at the finish of the
Kreutzer Sonata. Edward Scharf, on the piano,
and Musin, with the fiddle and bow, gave a splen-
did explanation of how it happened that the
married lady, in Tolstoi’s story, allowed the
influence of Beethoven to lead her astray, and
they will probably do it again during the week.
To-night (Thursday) and Saturday these talented
people are to be heard on the municipal premises,

The Alexandra management threatens to
yield up the ghost this week. Notwithstanding
that a new drama, entitled “England and Aus-
tralia,” precedes a musical olio by the Kangaroo
Club, and despite the enthe suspension of the free
list, in consequence of an enormous success, the
big house is “to let.” Melbourne theatres must
be closing as a mark of respect to the banks in
liquidation.

When Mrs. Bernard-Beere was in Adelaide a Social
Purity female wrote her a long and wailful letter about
the iniquity of riding in hansom cabs. Evidently the
appeal touched the lady’s soul, for she never rode in
another hansom in Adelaide. Such vehicles are there
monopolised by the wicked. As usual, the naughty
people get all the nice things.
For the sake of the ladies who rave about Ryley, and
who will feel broken-hearted when that brilliant youth
goes away—as he must, sooner or later— The Bulletin
rises to remark that Robert Inman, the most beautiful
actor who ever struck Australia, is now the lessee of a
theatre in Maoriland, and will doubtless drift back here
some day to fill a long-felt want. Inman isn’t handsome
—the word isn’t expressive enough ; if he were a woman
his loveliness would create a furore. Even his divine legs
could give Ryley’s 25 points in 100, and win easily, and
this paper is willing to back them in a beauty show
against the extremities of all-comers.
“And these are the wishes I wmh ” (pause for laugh).

Dear Bulletin,— Re par. last week. lamin a position
to state, from private information, that the lady best
known to Australians as Essie Jenyns has no present
intention of interfering with Ellen Terry. She still
alleges that she hates stage life and always regarded it
with abhorrence, and would not entertain the idea of
returning to it for an instant. No, she says, she is only

Dear Bulletin, —“ Poverty Point ” (August 6) speaks of
Gus Harris as being “ knighted in a false name.” Any-
way, his father, the founder of promenade concerts at
Covent Garden, lived and died under the same name, and
Gustus's two sisters were known always as Nellie and
Maria Harris in my young days. And, still harping on
family names—if Alice Leamar is now Mrs. Buttler she
must have waded into matrimony more than once. She
used to be Mrs. Bint.—E.F.
George Rignold took the tank with him to Melbourne,
but made no use of it. The season was so obviously past

and a water-jump.

On Walter Bentley’s first appearance in Brisbane lie was
escorted to the Opera House by six pipers, who came on
to the back of the dress-circle and regaled the audience
w ith choice selections whilst Rosendoril’s orchestra played
away in front. Neither would give in until the signal for
“ curtain up” was given—the din was terrific. Bentley
did enormous biz.
Concerning Coppih’s prize drama fiasco, this is about
how things stand. A prize was offered for the best drama
and one for the second best. The best drama out of 50
is simply the one that isn’t quite so bad as the other 49,
and the second best is the one that is less horrible than
the remaining 48. The decision of the judges practically
means that there isn’t a best or a second-best, which is
simply impossible. The authors were informed that
something was wanted after the style of “Hands Across
the Sea,” “ Harbour Lights,” &c.; in other words, they
were told to keep to the lines of certain ancient masses of
drivel, and having done so they were rejected because
they only produced drivel. They were instructed to fol-
low certain fixed horrors which contain about 100
characters and supers apiece, and then they were bounced
out because they had too many characters. Also, they
were warned that they must follow Sims and Pettitt, Who
haven’t one original dramatic idea between them, and
having done so, they were all rejected because they
lacked originality. And on top of all this they were
ordered to construct “good comedy parts, strongly-drawn
characters and powerful scenes ” by keeping an eye on
certain models w'hich never rise above a horse, a disin-
herited dude, and a tank.
Dear Bulletin,— Julius Knight hasn’t “ a decided Irish
accentit’s north of Scotland. He was born and reared

London critics, like The Bulletin, want to know - why
Sarah Bernhardt puts up Fleury, the weak-kneed, as
Armand to her Camille, w T hile Darmont, a better actor,
and more to her mind, stands down. Fleury has an
agreement, probably.
We saw an interesting spectacle the other night at the
door of a Sydney theatre. A clerical-looking person in
profound black and a grinning youth of 16 or thereabouts
bad been hovering for a while on top of the stairs, and
w’hen there was a momentary lull in the rush they drifted
up to the ticket-taker, nodded to him confidentially, and
walked in. The official hurriedly arrested the clerical one
by the tails of his black garment, and demanded two
tickets. “ We—haw - —we are never asked for tickets,” lie
explained blandly. “ Got a pass?” said the unsympathe-
tic official. “ No, a pass is—er—quite unnecessary in our
case; we—er—belong to the profession.” “Name,
please?” “Name! Oh—er—itdoesn’t matter ;my name
wouldn’t be familiar to you in any case.” “Well, what
theatre do you belong to?” “Oh, we don’t exactly
belong to any theatre. In fact, this young man,” indicat-
ing the grinning youth, “is—er—studying, and I’m his
tutor.” " “ What’s he studying?” “Oh—er—elocution.”
“ Well, you’d better see the manager.” Two minutes
later there was a hurried flight of a clerical-looking person
and a pimpled boy down the front steps, and the former
was heard remarking on the pavement that “ the dashed
impudence of these—er—colonial managers was—er —
unprecedented, and ought to be—haw—put dow - n with a
strong— er—hand.”
A larger number of Australian actors and actresses get
lost in India than in any other patch of ground the same
size on this earth. A gaudy-looking opera company
which left—er— somewhere, along, longtime ago has just
been heard of. It got into trouble first through the boss
insisting on paying salaries in much-depreciated silver,
involving a loss of nearly 40 per cent. Then business fell
off, and even the depreciated dollars weren’t forth-
coming. Next, the company was required to travel
second-class on dirty tramp steamers loaded down with
balf-clad natives, and when they suggested that the
manager and his wife should keep them company among
the fleas, niggers, andcockroaclus, the potentate tied, and
left his unpaid pro.’s stranded in a strange land. Some of
them are stranded there yet; a few are lost; and the
balance got back by various devices. Another operatic
company from south of the equator is aground in the
same region, the manager, a well-known warbler, having
borrowed their spare cash and bolted. Some of them
may possibly get back in an open boat later on,
but their prospects are extremely uncertain. India is
infested with wild-cat theatrical managers-not local
ones, but broken-down importations - and it is a good
country to keep out of.
Some American playwright has constructed a sensa-
tional drama in three acts, all the 12 parts to be repre-
sented by one actor, who will be the villain and the hero
and the deceived maiden in white, and the heavy father
and the principal murderer and the tumultuous crowd,
and all the rest, in his own person.
A hint for Australia. A theatrical performance has
been arranged at Terry’s theatre by Mrs. Willard, with
the object of establishing two beds for sick actors
at Westminster Hospital.
Apropos par. in recent Bulletin re plays in which the
Bible is read, “A Pair of Spectacles” was omitted. The
curtain goes down on one act while one of the brothers is
reading aloud from the Bible.
Judging by the gold-washed and over-scented women
who mobbed the d.c. of a certain Australian theatre on a
recent first night, you might almost say that the play
opened with quite a flourish of strumpets.
Foli was charmed with the voice of T. L. Middleton, an
Adelaids-born tenor, and has taken him on for the Maori-
land tour, with the chance of a longer engagement. We
presume Harley was too expensive.
Sydney University Dramatic Club congratulate them-
selves on having struck gold in their coach, Charlie
Burford. They are loud in praise of his energy, courtesy,

“I have often thought,” says an American critic, “in
studying the drama, that the good woman is never out of
drawing; the good man always is. The woman lends
herself to embellishment. You cannot put a touch
of tenderness, of sympathy, of grace, of charm of any
kind on a good woman in a play that she will not carry
off with complete naturalness. But you can’t polish up
a man without spoiling him. You may paint aLa France
rose on a potato sack, but it will not be a success. The
texture is too rough.”
Christie Murray, when recently heard of theatrically, was
playing “The Penitent" (from the French) at Glasgow
l{ o yal. The motif is the mysterious disappearance of a
girl. Her distracted lover enters the priesthood, and ‘2:!
years afterwards a grey-haired man enters his confessional
and tells him how he brutally murdered the lost Annette.
The priest hears him out, gives him absolution, and
having thus provided for the safety of his soul he jumps
on and strangles the penitent. Then he explains that the
deceased tried to rob him, and the curtain goes down as
the sacristan is busy hauling out the corpse.
“ Willie ” Boyd, who died the other day at Parramatta
of consumption, was brought to death’s door by rheu-
matic gout before the lung disease got its deadly grip on
him. Recently known in connection with a little side-
show at Bondi, he formerly was agent for Dan Barry and
other travelling shows, bad edited a country paper and
was son of a wealthy Peterhead (N. 8.) lawyer. He left a
wife, Virginia Clayton, the actress, whose recent appear-
ances have been with Sydney amateurs.
Sarah Bernhardt has been reciting Les Poemes d'Amour>
by Armand Silvestre, at the Lyric Club, London, with
appropriate tableaux. These poems are very beautiful,
but of the most fin da siiele school of thought, averring
that there is nought on earth worth living for but
desire, and couching this amorous philosophy in melodious
but highly-coloured and voluptuous language. Clement
Scott, Comyns Carr, J. IT. M'Carthy, and others have
lusciously anglicised these verses, which were admirably
rendered by Sarah, whose voice “ pulsated and thrilled
with immeasurable passion in every note, now rising to
superb defiance, now sighing with an ineffable longing.”
Alec. Mayne believes that “ Phil. Blood’s Leap,” under
which fine poem two or three different American names
have been printed in “recitation” hooks, was written by
Russell Lowell. Mayne got it from Te.m plb Bar years ago
(and (he London Magazine, no doubt, was the original
publisher) as the work of that brilliant, prolific, versatile
and immortal author, Anonymous.

The Davies mansion, Caulfield, for the one who holds

Bernhardt’s engagement of a new leading man somehow
reminds one of the coachman engaged by the pious mil-
lionaire, who said, “John, of course you will attend
family prayers." “ Yes, sir, but I hope you will remember
it in the wages.”
A London humourist on Eille Norwood : “ He not only
acts, manages, and initials tickets, but writes plays, com-

admirable Crichton !
Miss Fortescue, of “Gumboil” celebrity, is now the
profusely petted protegee of old Baroness Burdett-
Coutts, who has had a weakness for stage people ever
since she “took up” Irving in days of yore. Which
reminds us that Ashmead Bartlett managed to clear
Irving out of the way for fear the Baroness might want to
remember him too much in her will.

Nellie Veitch gave her dramatic pupils a field night at
the Hibernian Hall, Melbourne, last week. Some of the
pupils displayed a good deal of talent on the stage, whilst
many ladies amongst the crowded audience contributed
glorious shows of bust. Altogether there was plenty to
admire in the entertainment.
The Taylor-Carrington Dramatic Co., after a long

Oscar Wilde’s play “Salomd,” interdicted by the Lord

when his upper-storey is brought in on a plate the amor-
ous damsel wildly grabs it and showers on it repeated
kisses.
The Bulletin has excellent authority for

TWO RIVALS.
“Standing room only,” the notice read,
For the “ house ” was filled till the gallery swayed,
A seething mass below—o’erhead
Crammed from the roof to the palisade.
For a pandering people’s latest craze
The jewels flash in the flaring light;
A glamour of ideal grandeur sways
On an English actor’s opening night.
Did the loud “huzzas” from the crowded house
Reach a bed in one of the fever wards?
Did the actor battling death arouse
To catch an “ adieu ” from the brilliant “ boards?”
Bah ! folly ! there’s naught for such as he.
Down with the curtain, shut out the sight!
Why should we linger there to see
An Australian actor’s farewell night?
Tears ? Laugh them down—on—on with the farce,
The story now is, alas ! too old ;
’Twas “standing room only ” for English brass,
And “dying room only ” for Austral gold.

Mr. Frank Rogers, Q.C., the recently-

At the top of King-street, Sydney, it is
generally considered that Mr. C. G. Heydfin will
be the next N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge. The
Bulletin thinks, however, that the little blunder
in Buck’s case has postponed that appointment
indefinitely. One of the District Court Judges
should go up.
Frederick Morton, a Brisbane (Q.) man,

London Daily Chronicle settled Stanley’s
chance of election for Lambeth by reprinting his
own sanguinary narratives from the Daily Tele-
graph of 1875 :—“Forty-two savages were counted
on the field lying dead, and over 100 were seen to
retire wounded. On our side only two men
suffered contusions from stones.” H.M.S. couldn’t
get over this ancient history.
Parkes was born tongue-tied, and till he
was seven years old, he was considered of by no
moans g >od intellect, owing to this defect. Several
doctors who saw him refused to operate, but at
last he was seen by Dr. Rutter, who, with much
trouble, persuaded Parkes’ pa to let him unlock
the floodgates of Henry’s eloquence. Years after-
wards this Dr. Rutter came toN.S.W. and Parkes
made him visiting doctor to some Government
institution. The doctor lived in Parramatta until
a few years ago.
“ Her Majesty remained standing during
the entire conversation with Mr. Dibbs.” Which
reminds us of the policy adopted by Argus Editor
Haddon, of Melbourne, who keeps, or used to
keep, only one chair in his room—the one used by
himself. When a visitor came in, Mr. Haddon
(who, being a newspaper editor, never wanted any-
one to stop) stood up himself and asked the visitor
to sit down. The caller soon departed.
The lady who (as per cable) has purchased
Althorp Library in England lately, for
<£250,000, presented it to the City of Manchester,
is not Mrs. Hyland, as the S.M. Herald tells us
in no less than three places in one issue—but Mrs.
Hylands, widow of the late Peter Hylands,
long one of Gladstone’s staunchest supporters. He
separated from his leader on the Home Hide
question ; and the latter gave great offence on
both sides of the House, by saying : “ Old Peter’s
gone to the bad.” It is said that Hylands never
spoke to Gladstone afterwards,
Samuel Samuel, M.L.A., who died the
other day in Victoria, was a solemn example of the
vanity of earthly ambition. For 20 years he
worked to get into Parliament, and failed
regularly. lie was defeated three times by
Premier Shiels, and three or four times by other
members. But he had a big speech on some
financial topic preying on his vitals, and he
resolved to get mto Parliament and deliver it, or
perish. He got in. He was the first man to select
a seat in the new Parliament. Then he was taken
ill ere he had a chance to offer a single observa-
tion, and the night before the financial statement
lie died—succumbed to chloroform and sulphonnl
—with his oration undelivered, and his old enemy,
Shi els, adjourned the House as a token of respect
for the deceased.
By the death of T. K. Pater, P.M., the
Adelaide (S.A.) police-court has lost its presiding
humourist—a man with strongly-marked, tight-
skinned features, guttered with the visible egotism
of conscious smartness, and yet strangely
sardonic in the grin overseen by the beaky
nose. Pater’s humour never oozed out of him ;
he pumped it up with a force-pump, and,
moreover, he always let you know when he was
going to pump it. It usually came up frothy and
small beer. Originally an Old Bailey barrister in
London, Pater opened out as a second-rate general
practitioner in Adelaide, utilised some side-
suckers politically, and was for six years Northern
Territory Judge ; returned to Adelaide two years
ago with “ a fearful liver,’’and accepted the stipen-
diary magistracy of the city, becoming a stern
father to the juvenile offender, and a rough doctor
to the chronic drunk. He was 54 years old.
The flowery Fitzgibbou (writes our corres-
pondent) is in London, large as life, but the
greater personality of the N.S.W. Premier quite
eclipses such a minor light. Fitz. is on borrowing
bent, and, as Australian credit is fast rising, he
will probably be successful, and will go back with
a wonderful financial and diplomatic reputation,
Fitz. has already commenced to try some of his
‘ gammon.” He has caused it to be whispered
that, in the event of his proposed Melbourne loan
not being taken up in England, a syndicate of
French capitalists will be prepared to find the
required money. Which, of course, is all my eye.
Fifcz. appears to think that floating a large loan i

what wondrous, if tremulous, timbre and cunning j n ’
flections there are in it! Warmer still! Into every
corner penetrates the voice. It tells the people of their
wrongs. It marshals —the joke is of the stalest-the un
born millions, and in mournful march, shivering— always
shivering—they slink by with naked feet and “wracking
coughs. The electric lights dazzle our eyes. A heavy
drop, as of summer rain, falls on a blotting pad—a cold a
bad cold, which makes the eyes water, nothing more 1 '
The voice gets lower and lower, deeper and deeper. What
speaker may feel agony so excruciating, and yet gp 0 n
speaking? . . , A Minister sniggers!! Talk not of
Jove’s thunders. Round comes that virile champion
of the unborn millions, quivering with excite-
ment ; forth flashes his right arm ; his terrible
Core-finger, so to speak, picks up and pillories that
sinful Minister, holds him there, lashes him with scor
Pions’ whips, rives him with lightning, describes the mean
thing chastised. Stops ! gazes at it (not him) with a scorn
of scorn ; thunders with the prophet of old, “ Thou art
the man ! ” and casts the mangled, quivering remnants of
what was once a Minister into a far corner for the dogs
on the city wall to eat . . . And so he goes on Now
pausing to answer some ejaculator, or to turn the ejacu-
lation to profit; now interrupted by Mr. Speaker, anon
more often Mr. Speaker interrupting: stopping sometimes
for a moment’s converse with one who offers a suo-gest'on
discharging a joke subtle and fine ; back to the-unborn
millions, and at last—his seat. And—and, what has he
said ! Said be hanged ! ’Twas the manner of savin" it
we came to see and hear ; for there is but one Sir George
Grey. 8
The hanging penalty passed upon Joseph
Janies Carter, the Magill (Adelaide, S.A.) mur-
derer, is the first death-sentence which the merci-
fully-disposed Judge Bundey has ever been called
upon to pronounce. Carter was convicted chiefly
upon the evidence of his own eight-year-old son
whom he sent to knock at the door of his victim’s
residence, while he waited outside with a loaded
rifle, ready to shoot on sight. Carter, though
drunk at the time, was guiltily premeditative. It
is probable that his sentence will be commuted to
a long term of penal servitude, as the death-
penalty has been practically dispensed with in
South Australia.
“ Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness.”
One of the divine Commandants directs that
man shall not bear false witness against his neigh*
hour, and I regret that I should again find it
necessary to warn the public against designing
and dishonest impostors. In the first place,
“Clements Tonic” does not mean “a Tonic”
made by “ Clements ”! “ Clements Tonic ”is the
name of the remedy—it must have a name—but,
because the word Tonic appears, many ignorant
people run off with the erroneous idea that it is
merely atonic.’ It is time that such fallacies were
explained away. Again I state, Clements Tonic
is not a physic but a food. It does not create an
appetite for food which the stomach can’t digest,
but, by enriching the blood, it increases the sup-
plies of pancreatic and gastric juices, and thus
enables the stomach to digest more food to supply
the wear and tear or destructive metabolism
which goes on throughout the human body every
moment of our lives from the cradle to the grave.
I want the public to know that the “ Dyspeptic”
panaceas advertised with such plausible blarney
are only disguised cathartics, that the temporary
relief is only due to the purging, and not any
permanent benefit can be derived. These nostrums
are simply commercial speculations, and are pre-
pared by men who never had an hour's instruction
in, or study of, either pathology, pharmacology,
or therapeutics. Is it any reason because a man
has tried to be a shoemaker and failed that he is
qualified to treat disease ? If he can’t heel shoes,
can he heal bodies ? Does it stand to common
sense or reason that a man who has never had an
hour’s medical experience knows more about the
human body than men who have devoted their
whole lives and ability to the study of it and its
ailments. These lines are written in the interests
of sufferers and not in mine, it is no loss to me
if you spend your money or put your faith in
injurious preparations, and as far as Clements
ionic is concerned, it stands on its own merits; it
has grateful patrons in every city, town, and
village, and lias lived down all opposition and
calumny, and is now the standard of excellence
and comparison, and is eulogised and recom-
mended by faculty, press, and public everywhere,
and so long as this is the case it has no cause to
fear the base misstatements of envious pirates,
who one by one get to Darlinghurst. Verb. Sap.

Which denotes that the land monopolist expects

The S.A. Ministry at once snuffed out

On no occasion have the workers of
N.S. Wales refused to submit to the award of an

Premier Ballance : “ The Government

Paddy O’Sullivan, M.P. (Q.) : “The

Adelaide merchants and shipping firms

Tasmania’s deficits don’t evoke the wrath
of John Bull like those of the rest of the Austra-

that's the whole secret of the matter.
One of the commonest anomalies in the

Minister Tozer’s detectives attend the

Having wrung the right to coin its own
silver, the best thing Victoria can do is to adopt

On an attempt being made to emasculate
the new Maoriland Land Bill, the main principle
of which is perpetual leases, Premier Ballance
accepted the amendment as a vote of want of con-

A 10s. duty on the imported belltopper is
petitioned for by the Victorian tariff-revision

a Jid that the local hat-millers will then charge
about 30s. for the fitting emblem of obtrusive
loaferdom.
Gladstone, in the latest phase of his Home
Pule, makes it manifest that he clearly sees in the
near future the abolition of an hereditary peerage.
Which question, by the way, logically includes the
smaller one of an hereditary monarchy. From
that to no monarchy at all is but a “ mark-time ”
movement.
Parkes, according to Sydney E. News,
emphatically declines to again assume office in
N.S.W. The Bulletin also declines the billet of
Emperor of China, and the rumour that it in-
tended to accept the position of Archbishop of
Canterbury and Heir Apparent to the Crown is
entirely unfounded.
Little Hodgkinson, the Queensland Minister
for Mines, has impudently appealed to his electo-
rate to accept a land-grant railway, which would
entail a wholesale alienation of mineral rights
along the country traversed. The electors met
and decided that if they could only catch hold of
Hodg. they would make history.
Prompted by his greed for power, Griffith
has always made a dead set at anything like
ability in the Queensland Assembly. Aided by a
sycophantic following and a long monopoly of
office, he has succeeded in this so well that the
man for whom the nation yearns must be sought
for outside of Parliament. Where is he ?
A Geraldton (N.Q.) police-magistrate who
endeavoured to abolish Kanaka, intimacy with
aboriginal women, was not so very long ago
removed by means of the representations made by
local, lordly slave-holders, who seemed to be
generally of the opinion that to allow the Kanakas
free license among black-gins kept “ the boys ” in
good humour.
Tomkinson, ex-bank manager, who draws
a pension of £lOOO a year, has a bill before S.A.
Legislative Council to withdraw payment from
members of the House, which now contains three
direct representatives of Labour. His proposal is
that present members shall continue in possession
of their salaries but that future members shall not
receive remuneration.
Melbourne Standard, in an imbecile scrap
of verse, calls upon the “ sturdy working masses ”
not to allow “mischief-making asses” to sever
them from “ the labour-giving classes.” “ Labour-

POLICEMAN: “What are you doing here?"

Under the new Queensland “retrench-
ment ” (i.c. anti-Labour) rules, the Speaker is to
be the sole judge as to what speeches shall or slinll
not be printed in Hansard. The Kanakilgriff
thus deliberately proposes to cook the official
records of parliamentary proceedings, to officially
publish a weekly lie, and to make suppression of
the truth the official standard of morality.
The N.Q. Separation movement was
begun by a pack of boodlers eight years ago, when
the MTlwraith s coolies were refused admission to
Queensland. If it is a success now it is quite
likely that instead of a boodleground it will turn
out to be the most democratic province in Austra-
lasia. Its big wid( aw ike mining population con-
sists of some of the sturdiest stuff extant.
A fact not emphasised by the daily press.
The Pastoraljsts’ Association of New South
Wales has declined to register under the
Trades Unions Act—so that it may not be com-
pelled to nominate representatives in the Court of
Conciliation. The pastoralists, you see, being
determined to rule by brute force, and brute -force
only, snap their fingers at public opinion.
Old man Parkes (77): “Five days ago
Tennyson was 83 years of age ; on 29th Dec. Mr.
Gladstone would be 83; and if the children born
to-day lived to be the age of Tennyson and Glad-
stone, there would then be in this country
83,700,000 persons.” On what basis of reproduc-
tive computation ? The fertility of the old man
and the prospective longevity of Ins newest baby ?
Victoria has had the anti-Chow-influx
regulations printed in Chinese on large bills, which
are to be posted up in the Mongolian seaports.
Premier Shiels, however, not being a Chinese
scholar himself, has been compelled to trust in a
Mongolian litterateur, and is not quite sure that
those posters don’t contain all points needful for the
guidance of Chows who want to dodge the poll-
tax.
“ Gold-getting here (Port Darwin) is be-
coming so entirely a Chinese transaction that it
hardly matters to us whether the yield is one

industrious pagan to wipe us out, and he is quickly
learning his lessons.” Northern Territory

Jawbone Neild, M.P., (N.S.W.) might
follow up his Divorce Bill and Infants Protection
Bill with a measure to legitimatize the natural
children of persons who afterwards inter-married.
This principle was enacted 30 years ago, in the
interest of half-caste children, in Maoriland. _ A
one-clause bill would have a good chance of being
passed in the lifetime of the present N.S.W.
Parliament.
Dear Bulletin, —Economists of all classes
seem to find considerable difficulty in agree.ng
upon a common definition of Capital. How is
this? “Capital is wealth containing within its
elements the active principle of any industrial
process. When wealth of this nature —or when
wealth wherein such features are wanting—
is ingeniously employed for the purpose of pro-
ducing individual profit, it then becomes
Capitalism, which is a totally different thing.”—
C. Junor.
To hear Parkes “gas” re his determination
to keep Australia inviolate for “ people descended
from that best type of men, the Anglo-Saxon and
Celt, to inherit these lands free from the possible
danger of any inferior class being established
amongst them,” one would hardly recognise in the
boaster who declared that he had “ always held
one opinion,” the quondam printer who employed
half nig. compositors at low wages to run out
white typos, of “the best type of men” in
connection with Iris long-defunct Empire.
One George Pile, who is obviously
English, writes to the Sydney D.T. to point out
that all the political troubles that have ever
existed between France and England arise from
one cause, “ the patriotic over-zeal of the French
consular and mercantile agents, the English in all
cases only entering into the contest for self-
protection.” In other words, G. Pile reluctantly
admits that his country is always right, which
reminds us a good deal of Yum-Yum’s innocent
surprise on discovering, upon her own evidence,
that she was the most beautiful individual on the
whole earth.
From B. Ringnose Wise’s recent oration
at Wagga (N.S.W.): —
The Freetraders believed that as everything came from
the land, the land should bear the burden of taxation,
but the members of the Upper House would not agree to
that so long as the working men of the colony placed
taxes upon themselves by means of Protection.
The Bulletin hereby contradicts this statement
from one end to the other. The N.S.W. so-ca}]ed
“Freetraders” were in power for nearly half-a-
century, and they never even suggested that the
land should bear the burden of taxation. Ringnose
Wise was himself in office for a considerable
period, and said not a word about it. A political
belief that only holds good when the party is out
of office isn’t worth calling a belief and is of no use
to anybody, and the Freetrade faith in land-taxa-
tion is of this order. It is only the old story of
the devil who is sick stating what he will do when
the devil gets well again.
The land is the lever. Major Calhoun, just
from America, to a Sydney D.T. reporter:—
“Again and again the Carnegie Co.’s workmen
have endeavoured, by establishing co-operative
building associations, to become their own land-
lords, but the Co. has invariably refused to part
with the land. A man occupying his own house
would be comparatively independent, but as long
as he was a tenant of the Co. he was to that extent
an industrial slave.” Calhoun sums up Carnegie
as “an intelligent, selfish demagogue,” who,
among 40,000 hands, employs 30,000 half-rate
mean-whites. According to Australian notions,
Carnegie’s record justifies the Pittsburg strike,
and would justify the dynamiting of all his Pitts-
burg works with Carnegie Guy-Fawksed on the
summit of their tallest chimney. He has success-
fully plotted against the honest toilers, whose
extremity has been his opportunity, vvhose wasted
blood has dropped into his wallet in silver dollars,
and whose corpses are the walls of his mint.
“I gemmed my discourse,” said a clerical

An old Queensland bushman, who, despite
his score of years residence in the Gulf country,
has never lost his Irish brogue, was down in
Brisbane the other day, spending his “calabash.”
A miserable, half-civilised aboriginal accosted
him. “Faix, thin,” said the broguey man,
“phwat troibe do yez belong to?” “ Mine been
Irishman ; yowi, budgery Roman Catholic, plenty
good as any fellow Roman Catholic longa Bris-
bane sit down.”
A bit of unrecorded Queensland history.
Drayton (Q.) is about three miles from Too-
woomba. In the early days the teams bound
Westward spelled at Drayton after the long pull
up the ranges, to enable them to better negotiate
the black soil flats beyond. It was then a busy,
thriving place whose future seemed t > be assured.
Toowoomba consisted of an hotel built beside a
swamp. The District Court held Sessions in the
long dining-room of an hotel in Drayton. One
day the court offended the publican, who promptly
flung it out. The hotel at Toowoomba was then
gazetted as the future place of Session. Other
Government offices gradually came into existence
there, and the place grew. To-day Drayton is
almost deserted and the other placet is a largo
thriving centre. All because an insignificant
publican had an evil temper.
Dear Bulletin, —Apropos your mot : “ The
Churches are dying.” Two schoolmates, Joe and
Fred., left Adelaide for Bathurst (N.S.W.) to
study for the R.C. priesthood. Joe was a
“ pressed ” man. His only brother was a “licensed
to kill,” and his parents had to find a profession
for Joe. Two years after, his mother returned
from vespers one Sunday night to find the scamp
seated by the kitchen-fire, and divil a rosary-bead
in his fist. Fred, got as far. as the Propaganda,
Rome, lost his “ vocation ” during a stroll through
the Coliseum or somewhere, advertised fur it in
“dog-Latin,” and, after an unsuccessful wait,
returned to S.A. a travelled man. There has only
been one Croweater, Neddy O’Brien, in the S. A.
secular clergy. A splendid type of Australian
manhood, his purse was always open to the poor,
and he died leaving behind him not a solitary
cent.— Young ’Un.
Dear Bulletin, —A roundabout note as
to that Richmond (N.S.W.) Church register entry
—“ Margaret Catchpole ”is not the heroine of the
book. And thereby hangs a story ! Nor was it
a Cope who was a member of the Sydney
Mechanics’ Committee in ’4B. It was W. T. Cape
—one of whose grand-children, by-the-bye, a
daughter of one of the Riverina Langs, was quietly
married the other day at St. Mark’s, Darling
Point, having come all the w.ay from England to
be wedded. Cape had the distinction, one of
many, of having switched learning into a Premier
and a Chief Justice. Sir John Robertson once
told me “all the (sanguinary) stuff he ever learned
at the (cerulean) school was knocked into him by
Timothy Tug-mutton Tight-breeches.” I was
coming up from Watson’s Pay on the steamer
with the old warrior on that day, and, fool that I
was, I offered to assist him aci'oss the gang-plank.
Need I say what happened ? And, passing to
another par. in your last issue, if William Dixon
had been 94 years in N.S.W., how could he have
come by “ the first fleet ?”-
PRICE WARUNG.
Dear Bulletin, —My friend, an Adelaide
medical student, writes me: —“This week we
post-mortemed the famous ‘ Captain Thunder-
bolt.’ He began by sticking up his own father
with a scent-bottle and extracted Is. fid. from the
old man. Masked, he rode his dark bay with
white bandages on the forelegs and a white rag
(blaze) down the forehead, and in this manner
stuck up mails and private’traps. Then, decamp-
ing, he divested himself of disguise, removed the
‘ fixings ’ from his dark bay, and rode uncon-
cernedly back to town. He was seated in the
body of the court whilst two of his comrades were
sentenced to ‘life.’ Next day he wrote to the
dailies that the ringleader had been present at the
trial, that those convicted were innocent, and
that, as he was in want of the ‘ ready,’ they would
hear of him in the immediate future. Two days
after he robbed a coach. The post-mortem re-
vealed a heart which, from its magnitude, is
anatomically termed cocur-dc-haeuf, or bullock’s
heart. His kidneys were of an alcoholic and
gouty type, whilst one of the most important
centres of his brain had a companion (foreigner)
in the shape of an extravasation of blood. This
latter caused lateral palsy of the right side, from
which he was recovering when death overtook
him.”—Young TJn.

The pabition in a much-talked-of-sociefcy-
fcbeatrical divorce suit, in which an Australian
lady is involved, was served on the co-respondent
last week. The Bulletin doesn’t wish to com-
ment on the case further than to say that in its
mind’s eye, Horatio, it sees a big sensation loom-
ing in the near future for the moral evening press.

Millionaire Burdekin, after his return to
N.S.W. Parliament for the Hawkesbury a week
or so ago, mailed visiting-cards of himself and
wife to all the people, of sufficient social standing,
in the electorate who had voted for him—probably
a wrinkle he got during his recent visit to Eng-
land, where female interference in political con-
tests is running to riot at present. Yet it was not
altogether a wise thing to do. It is rather calcu-
lated to alienate the future votes of those outside
tre drawn line. By the way, it will be interesting
(in view of the way in which his more brainy
opponent, Morgan, trod upon his heels) to watch
whether Burdekin keeps his ante-election pledge
to stick to his present constituents at next general
election.

It was hard upon the Dibbs that, his
valise having been taken away by mistake from
Hatfield House, he should be compelled to dine,
and on Sunday, too, in morning-dress,” says a
London correspondent of The Bulletin. “It
turned out that a valet of the Duke of Edinburgh
had taken the great Panjandrum’s togs away to
London by mistake. When the valise was re-
turned Mr. Dibbs’s dress-coat Was missing. It is
currently reported that the Duke of Edinburgh
desired to keep this garment as a souvenir of the
Australian statesman, and of Australian tailoring,
but the more likely story is, that it was stolen by a
waiter.”
* * *
The Dibbs was to give an elaborate dinner
of 100 covers at the London Metropole, on 22nd
July, as a sort of return for the hospitality he
had experienced in England. It had been inti-
mated that should the D. specially wish the
Prince of Wales to be present, H.R.H., out of
compliment to Australia, would not decline, but
the D. thought it better not to invite him for a lot
of reasons, in one of which ‘‘Ginger ” Clarke was
an element.
# # #
The Bulletin’s London correspondent;—
You may take it from me that, with the exception,
perhaps, of Sir Charles Tapper, no Australian
politician has ever been so well received or half so
much thought of as George Dibbs.

An historic N.S.W. family’s property is
coming into the courts—on a friendly suit! The
parties (three) are all minors, and the trustees in
each case are either lawyers or financiers ! Need
we say more? Ten legal “infants ” now entitled
to £lOO,OOO among them may have a magnificent
wealth of oyster-shells on attaining majority a
few years hence.

The Australian Banking Company’s alleged
defaulters, who were not prepared with bail, were
taken from Sydney Water Police Court in the
prison-van, stripped, and bathed, and measured,
and incarcerated in solitary cells for six hours
daily. This without a word of evidence against
them. “I don’t want a bath,” said.one unfor-
tunate. But in he went, and asserts that he has
not felt well since. This will be nasty reading
for the authorities of a defunct “ respectable ”
institution which is now being brought into pro-
minence.

A Woman’s Suffrage oratoress in Sydney,
last week, told the League that since the com-
mencement of the movement in N.S. Wales, the
leaguesses were “more cheerful, because our minds
are climbing up into the sunshine of the soul.”
Ladies who go in fur gymnastics of this kind will
have to be careful, or they will make a terrible
display of the ankles of their understandings.

At a recent meeting to establish a N.S. W.
Social Purity Vigilance Association one speaker
suggested that women who had borne illegitimate
children should be given low diet and hard labour
—what a humorist ! —and be imprisoned. What’s
the matter with the good old cat, which was
amongst the earliest orthodox remedies for the
importunities of the flesh ?

The public must insist on having full
details of the medical row at Sydney Hospital.
Semi-suppressed rumours that patients are being
butchered to make a doctors’ holiday strike at the
very root of the usefulness of the institution, a
usefulness which is founded on poor and ignorant
patients’ belief that they will be carefully
and skilfully treated. Should this scandal be
smothered for the benefit of interested persons,
instead of being openly and sternly dealt with, it
will be a disgrace to the Government by whom the
hospital is cliiefly supported.
A correspondent tells us that a matter
which needs looking into is the singularly un-
gentle relations of the Sydney University medical
students to the obstetric practice at the lying-in
section of the local Benevolent Asylum. Our in-
formant avers that an examination of the books
will show an undue number of surgical casualties
during maternity.

It was very kind indeed of Mr. Whipping-
dale Johnson, S.M., to admit that Banker Cotton,
in wielding a heavy ebony ruler on labour-delegate
Sleath’s head, “ used a weapon hardly justifiable
under the circumstances.” Had Sleath’s skull
been fatally fractured, would Mr. Johnson have
summed up for a verdict of “ hardly justifiable
homicide ? ”

All the Melbourne papers give “Mr.”
Cotton’s statement of the occurrence, and “Sleath’s
version,”

Graham Berry mentions that whilst Vic-
toria has retrenched in beef and mutton and other
necessaries, the spirit-duties come in to the full
extent. “In times of depression, as in other
times,” says the knowing old bird, “there are
certain articles, and spirits is pre-eminently one of
these, that men will have as long as they can find
money.”

Millionaire Jimmy and his brother, William
Tyson, were travelling to Narrabri, N.S.W., per
Nowland’s coach, about the year ’72. There were
two other inside passengers, one of whom en-
livened the tedium of a night’s journey by relating
anecdotes of public men of the time, with whom
lie seemed intimately acquainted. Eventually,
the conversation rested on Australian millionaires,
and the talk-monopoliser told many tall yarns of
adventures that had befallen him when in company
with Ids bosom-friend, Jimmy Tyson. When the
coach spelled at Gunnedah next morning, the first
salutation of the hotelkeeper was—“ Good morn-
ing, Mr. Tyson ; glad to see you this way again.”
Jimmy’s bosom-friend failed to turn up at break-
fast, nor was he up to time when the coach con-
tinued its journey.

One of the many un-
successful searchers for
a certain missing explorer
some years ago died and
was buried a few miles
distant from a N.Q.
station now owned by his
wealthy relative. Th e
defunct’s Adelaide ad-
mirers subscribed for
and purchased a monu-
ment, which was shipped
as far as Thursday
Island. A Gulf carrier,
who knew the departed
brother, made a generous
offer to the wealthy
squatter: “If you pay
the freight of the tomb-
stone from Thursday
Island to Normanton,
I’ll bring it along to your
station.” “If you’re so
darned hot on the tomb-
stone,” replied the man
of acres, “hang you, I’ll

There are some deep
drainage excavations
going on in a Surry
Hills (Sydney) street.
One day recently a child
of very tender years was
playing on the verge,
andfa woman yelled from
a window to a lad, aged
six or seven, to pull the
little tot back. “He ain’t

retort. That lad will

A very high dignitary in Adelaide used in-
fluence with the Law officers of the Crown to pre-
vent the prosecution of a Civil servant attached to
the Supreme Court. It was arranged that the
.£5O first found to be short should be repaid, and
the trouble squared, but other big defalcations
were discovered afterwards and Nemesis shook
herself up again.
The story of the returned prodigal is being
acted over again in Maoriland, with variations.
A few years ago a society lady, in a Southern city
vanished unexpectedly with a financier, leaving
her husband, a well known business man, and
her family in the lurch. She and the financier
fled to Europe, and the husband went in pursuit
presumably with murderous intentions. But tI IP ,
other man kept ahead, and the husband came back
and got a divorce, and settled down again. Then
the lady’s father, who was a peaceful old gentle-
man with much money, died in a sad and broken-
spirited way, and left bis pile to bis other children.
It is just here that the lost daughter comes ini
According to all precedent she should have come-
back late on a cold night with blind staggers and
a wailing infant, and entered the front garden to
the sound of slow music, and fainted on the door-
step ; but somehow the arrangements have gone
wrong. She has come back all right, with the
financier and the infant, but instead of being
humble and broken-up she has returned in anew
spring bonnet, and is suing her sister for the old
man’s money on the ground of “ undue influence.”
Therefore the parable of the prodigal son wants
immediate revision, and should be re-written with
the youth summoning his aged parent for the fatted
calf with five per cent, interest and costs, and the
venerable defendant should be made bankrupt in
the last act through non-payment of law expenses.

N.S.W. country policemen are prohibited
from owning private horses, on the ground,
apparently, that, though they may be trusted to
deal righteously with the public, they cannot be
trusted to deal honestly with any Government
provender that may be placed in their charge, but
would be likely to feed their private mokes at the
State’s expense. One sergeant was removed from a
station which he had occupied for 20 years,
because the local Mayor complained to police
headquarters that the officer used his own horse
and buggy for police work!
A Sydney Israelite who owns a terrace of
houses which return =£2 per week each, lately re-
duced his rents a halfpenny! By this means he
really makes three half-pence per week on each

pence.
THE DUTV WE NEVER AVOID
The hungry eat when times are good
And people buy the things they need ;
For none go short of clothes and food
Except when times are had indeed.
A “ bob ” for this, a “ bob ” for that—
A slice of lean, a piece of fat—
A new sac suit, a Hinglish hat,
When times are good and prospects pink.
But cut down that and cut down this
When times, alas ! have gone amiss,
Dispense with all that tends to bliss,
A‘l, all except-a drop of drink.
When things are at their very worst
And duns are dodging round the door,
The man who can’t afford a thirst
Must he, forsooth, absurdly poor.
Though short of meat and short of bread,
With scarce a blanket on his bed,
Or pillow for his aching head
There still remains one little link,
A link that binds him tight and fast
Unto the happy, merry past.
He hunts about and finds at last
The means to go and get a drink.
Great Alcphol! to thee we sing ;
True friend alike of poor and rich 1
To all of us you fondly cling
Without observing which is which.
A care to drown, a hope to raise—
A pain to lull, a friend to praise ;
You serve us in a thousand ways
Of which there’s now no time to think,
Your duty to us all you do
1 he ever-changing seasons through ;
And we are dutiful to you
According to how much we drink.

THE LAND BEYOND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O, know you the land that is out at the back of all
dreaming,
The land that is truest of all, being nought but a seeming,
A 11 ishing of soul, and of spirit a brilliant beaming?
Lo, that is the land of all joys and delight and all
laughters,
With the blue of soft skies for a dome and bright rainbows
for rafters,
Which has never a past or a present, and knows no here-
afters.
Lo, that is the land where all aim has completes! ful-
filling,
Where the sweetest of songs from the gladdest of hearts
aye are trilling,
Where the harvests of heaven are reaped without sweat of
sad tilling.
There the wine-cup of pleasure is drained without drop-
ping of tears,
There love as a rose-coloured flame in dead darkness
appears,
And the living of life is a long march of musical years.
Yea, such is the land that is out at the hack of all dreaming,
The land that is truest of all, being nought hut a scorning,
A flashing of soul, and of spirit a brilliant beaming.

“I HAVEN’T FOUND HIM YET."
Melbourne.
Thirty-one, and still unmarried !
I am almost “on the shelf,”
Though, of course, I wouldn’t own it
To a soul except myself:
And I’ve had my share of chances—
Just how many, I forget—
But I wanted an ideal
And I haven't found him yet.
I was nearly wedding Charlie,
Who was really very nice,
But I found out that he gambled,
Played at cards, and shook the dice:
“S in. would not renounce his liquor.
Nor would Phil his cigarette—
If there is a man who’d do so,
Well, I haven’t found him yet!
Where’s the man, who for a woman
Will forsake his fav’rite “ pub.,’*
Will give up his dogs and horses,
And forswear the sporting club ?
Such a paragon there may be,
But, amongst the men I’ve met,
He has managed self-effacement,
And I haven’t found him yet.
I suppose ’twas rather foolish
To expect a pattern man,
Anyhow, I’ve failed to find one,
Now I’ll gladly change my plan—
Take the very next that asks me.
Though he smoke and drink and bet,
Then, perhaps, I’ll get a husband,
Though I haven’t found him yet.

HER SENTIMENT.
(F OR THE BULLETIN.)
She was a Brisbane girl.
Her parted, well-curved lips
Displayed a row of pearl
Behind their rosy dips.
She was a Brisbane girl.
A peerless Brisbane girl.
Her eyes were innocent
Of guile, or wile, or whirl,
But beamed a sweet content.
A peerless Brisbane girl.
I saw her at the Show,
1 marked her modest mien,
Her peach-tints all aglow
With happiness serene.
I saw her at the Show.
With reverence enwreathed,
A holy calm wore she ;
Her very presence breathed
An angel purity,
With reverence enwreathed.
And high intelligence
Was seen enthroned upon
Her forehead ; every sense
With sinless wisdom shone,
And high intelligence.
Her artless bosom heaved,
A quiver thrilled each cheek,
A thought her soul conceived,
She was about to speak.
Her artless bosom heaved.
What pearl of sentiment.
What gem of thought divine,
Would this sweet innocent
Now cast before these swine?
What pearl of sentiment ?

The shock dispelled my valour;
Oh ! why did I persist?

Victorian Education Department proposes
abolishing home lessons for State-school children,

able draper. This doesn’t
include board or lodging,

the establishment gener-
ally, and even then his
boss seems to be haunted
by a constant fear that
he may spend his two
half-crowns all at once

The practice of sons
and sons-in-law appear-

The “ Heathen Chinee ”
is an apt learner, and in
a recent Sydney case
tried how a magistrate
would decide when the
son was in his eyes. How-
ever, the justice decided
the case according to the
law and the evidence.
A Tonga (South Seas) correspondent
writes ; —The Tonga natives have formed a police
force, the initial body being one captain and six
privates, and they have ordered from Sydney
(N.S.W.) uniforms of blue serge, helmets, etc., to
correspond in every way with the rig-out of the
Sydney force. This compliment ought to crown
Inspector Fosbery’s happiness in the sunset of his
official career. The Tongans are also building a
gaol, capable of holding ten prisoners; which is
evidently an attempt to keep pace with Sydney’s
new Central Police Court.
Dear Bulletin, — Peccavi ; likewise Mus-
covy. I’ll confess all about it. In this N.Q.
coastal town Brother Blank one day noticed that
his next-door neighbour, Sister Blink, was out for
a holiday. Surmising that she would be too tired
to cook anything for herself when she returned,
and in the belief that she would be hungry, he
went into her yard and caught two of her Mus-
covy ducks, which he duly slaughtered, plucked,
dressed, and cooked on his own premises. By a
curious lapse of memory he forgot to carry the
banquet into Sister Blink’s, but, a few friends
having dropped in to see him, the ducks were
demolished without either “grace before” or
“ grace a r ter.” (I was one of the guests myself.)
Mrs. Blink soon discovered her loss and went
rampaging around. Like the typical detective,
she soon found a clue. Ah Gett, the Chinese
cabbage-merchant, had been seen with Muscovies
in his baskets. Mrs. Blink swooped down upon
Ah Gett’s premises like an excise-officer on an
illicit-still, found two Muscovy ducks hanging up
there, sent for the police, gave Ah Gett in charge,
swore in the police-court that the ducks were her
property and had been stolen, and had Ah Gett
sent up to do “three months’ hard.” Is the
Caucasian played out? Not in this progressive

A North Coast (Tasmania) paper was sold
for 11s. 6d., the other day. The man who bought
it would probably have given 15s, for the small-
pox.
A Melbourne man has discovered a system
of preparing tripe for book-binding purposes. We
know that man and we know his system. We
once lived at his hash-house.
Melbourne Brewers’ Club petitions for an
allowance per hogshead off the new excise duty,
“ because in climates like that of Victoria, in
filling the casks allowance had to be made for the
expansion of the beer.” It is probably this ex-
panding property in the beer that swells a man’s
head when he has filled himself right up.
Dear Bulletin, —You may well ask—
“ Where is the immortal teetotaller?” And to
the names of liquor-taking men with their “ rich,
warm tints and full-bodied accomplishments ”
(glorious phrase) add those of every Australian
who has ever said or written a good thing up to
date. (This latter clause may not mean much,
but it means a little anyhow.) What is it Bis-
marck says : —“ The Southerners are born with a
bottle of wine in their inside, and if we Northerners
wish to maintain our supremacy we must put one
there.” Away, let us hie to our hostelry and order
two full-bodied accomplishments with a split
warm tint. —The Phcenix.
The House of Lords has decided the
Savernake Estate question in favour of money-
lender Sam Lewis. The Marquis of Ailesbury
mortgaged Savernake to Samuel and when the
latter talked of foreclosing, a number of Ailes-
bury’s “ heirs in remainder” moved to annul the
deal. The argument was, in fact, that the estate
couldn’t pass out of the noble family’s possession,
and that Samuel had obtained no real mortgage
for his money. That almighty usurer pretty
nearly owns the House of Lords, however, so the
Marquis of Ailesbury has obtained leave to sell
his ancestral acres for throe-quarters-of-a-million

Lewis will get most of the coin, no doubt, in the
form of principle and interest. Especially
interest.
Dear Bulletin,— lie the late find of alleged
human bones in Market-street, Sydney. The
“old city-market” site, or thereabouts, was for-
merly a cemetery. There are now in Sydney two
ancient residents, the one a publican, the other an
alderman, who have two very queer rings, each of
the same antique pattern, curiously wrought and
designed, and set with good stones. The two men
came into possession of these rings thus ; The
publican was then a contractor for ballasting
vessels. The stone used for ballast was supposed
to be got from the Pyrmont quarries, and a lot of
young men were employed breaking it down at
piecework. It got abroad that these young rascals,
instead of travelling all the way to the Pyrmont
quarries, used to visit the city graveyard at night
and steal tombstones, which they used to pound
up and deliver to the ballast-contractor.
So watches were set in order to stop this
alleged desecration. One night the publican and
the alderman were in the graveyard, partly watch-
ing, partly “pitching.” They sat them down on
a flat, box-like tombstone to rest and argue. In
the heat of debate one of them sprang nu and sat
down again hurriedly. Down went the lid of the
tomb, and down among the coffins went the dis-
putants. Their fall broke a double coffin-lid, and
they saw by the moonlight two skeletons resting
side by side —husband and wife, maybe. But,
glittering in the beams, on one bony digit of each
corpse’s left-side skeleton-hand, was a curious
ring. Without a word, each man accepted the
proffered gift from the dead, and, I believe, each
lias his keepsake still. You will hardly find a
more odd-looking annulet in Sydney than those
doubles. —Yours, corpse-revivingly, The Diplo-
ma NAIC.
TRUE KINDNESS.

ONCE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
How could you smile as you passed by ?
A smile so free,
For me to see,
To learn that your love was no more for m
And once all the world to each were we ;
Once when you never passed me by.
Why did you smile when you passed by ?
A smile so gay,
It seemed to say,
Fled was the thought of a happier day
When in content on my heart you lay ;
Once when you never passed me by.

CORRESPONDENCE
No notice will be taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must in every case appear on MS.
“Wilhelm Meister”: Declined. Long, in-
coherent wails about the re-construction of society are
unreadable.Sneerby ” : Thanhs..Jerry Grimble ” :
Who are the “frauds” whom “The Bulletin cracks up
simply because they are Irish Catholics?” You couldn’t
name one to save your immortal soul, if yon had a 50u1...
“Rory”: Thanks....“ H. Thorpe”; “The Diggers’
Lament” is so dreary “Carver Doone”: There
is not one new idea in your 14 pages, and when you bor-
rowed the old ideas you misunderstood them and misread
them—“R.A.B.” : Sorry, but we can’t let you interfere
between Lawson and “ Banjo.” It wou'dn’t be safe for
you. Go and hit a bard your own size.... “ Bushbag ” ;
It isn’t safe to say that all bush bards are liars. It isn’t
safe tojthink it either, except in disguise....“ J. Barr”
(Wellington): Nothing in it but the old dreary cant
phrases of the tenth-rate democrat—the “ blood” and the
“ sweat ” and all the rest of it. These things were all
right enough a million years ag0.,.. “ A.0.Y.” :An old
story badly told for the six hundred and fiftieth time
“Irish”: We have hunted kangaroos, but never that
way. A man who hunts in a frock coat is deranged but
not gaudy . ..“J.A.”; There is much eloquent “barren-
ness” and “blackness” and “ blasted ness ” in your
verse, but the meaning is obscure and the metre
gone in the feet.. ..“Rhode”: Terribly stilted and
stagey. If people talked like that in real life they
w’ould bur5t......“ Svvaggy ” : Give the swagrnan a
rest. The nation can only stand a limited amount of
swag poetry “ Con Bede ” (Queensland): Two columns
of small-beer gossip about the Jemima Anns of a drivel-
ling hush hamlet “ G.H.” (Woollahra): Such lines as
“ Old Nana and his gang were busted on the bang ” are a
woeful sacrifice of sense to rhyme. What is the “ bang?”
... “ J.E.C.” (Taralga); Only a weak-kneed parody on
Hoodßhode ” : There is no woman living who says
“methinks” and obsolete things like that to her dead
husband. You might as well make a Chinaman say
“Gramercy! Any spling callot?” “Young ’Un”:
Too irreverent “even for The Bulletin.” “ C. 8.”
(Christchurch, M.L.): Will peruse any you send....
“Shareholder” (Gympie, Q.): Story climaxless
“ W.C.” (Maryborough): There is a painfully-acquired
melancholy in your verses ; evidently you have borrowed
a harrowing grief from someone, and it’s a misfit.. . “The
Sphinx”: Declined. Only a gory murder “S. W.
Mackay ” : We know that tale of the long-lost brother.
We met it often in the penny dreadful when we were
young —“ H. Hilton ’’: Your gathering of insane ghosts
has some good points, but the principal spectre wants to
be re-written.-...“F.5.P.” (North Sydney); There is just
one objection to your “Humours of the Street”-—they
aren’t humorous. Humour ought always to be more or
less humorous... “Flaneur”: We decline to read your
poem. There are 68 verses in it, which damns it quite
sufficiently “ Talipes ”: It may be original enough,
but no one would believe it. Send us something that
hasn’t such a fatal resemblance to Max Adeler....
“ Rejected”; Your nom-de-plume exactly expresses the
s tualion. “H.N.G.” (Tauranga): Declined...." Loo
King ” : The first two lines are fatal :
The boy stood there before them all
A Radical so slim. '
“ M. Darcourt” : A decent story badly told ; if you wrote
the story of the storming of Jerusalem that way it would
be as flat as a suburban borough council meeting
“C.J.S.” (Croydon): We decline to “suggest any
improvements.” An improvement must have something
to stand 0n.... “ Kangaroo ” : You “ think The Bulletin
is disgusting.” That’s just where you’re wrong. You
can’t think without the necessary apparatus. There-
fore you don’t think. You only think you think.
What you take to be thoughts are probably corns ...
“T. Flynn ” (Carlton): There are fourteen separate kisses
in your poem, which is altogether too agitating
“ W.C.” (Maryborough): The dirge of the man who wants
his grave kept green is hackneyed and behind the times.
Cremation is coming, and the dying person’s cry now is
that his ashes may be kept bottled “Carington”:
Smith is an older name than Carington, anyhow. It is a
royal name, and dates back 2500 years and more...
“Shadow ” : We have met that horse-lie before, but can’t
remember where “J.P.8.”: We are weary of the
drunken shearer knocking down his cheque. The modern
shearer isn’t so drunken “F.J.H.” (Paroo River): A
man can’t ride 30 miles after being “stung” (bitten, we
suppose you mean) by “ a serpent—you are from England,
sure-of the deadliest type.” “M. Ronald” (Goul-
burn): Not that we know 0f... “ Radical ” (Hobart):
Some old, all too spun-out. Condense “T.H.”: No,
Mr. Egeson has left the Government service “A. J.
Cotton ” : If you don’t like to ride in the tram with men
in their working clothes you’d better hire a special train.
... “E.C.0.”: You must cut it down. Forty such para-
graphs would fill the whole Bulletin “Musicus”:
Yes, but the young lady’s concerts didn’t pay, all the
same. (2) Dilke owns the Athenieum “ Port Mel-
bourne”: Unsavoury “ D.0.R.” : “Botany’s Last
Sprint” excellently written—but the theme is hackneyed,
and the scene is laid in a place where, to the knowledge of
everybody, no such thing ever occurred. Try another
subject—“A.A.”: Home Rule may be shoved aside
and with a good, all-round democracy Ireland may be
satisfied.. “E. Molesey”: Let the Kanaka labour-
traffic be described as speciously as Griffith’s best special
pleading, it still remains exposed as slave-buying and
slave-selling , “Pilot”: The truth is that in Queens-
land the West-Central districts are apprehensive of being
just as badly governed from Rockhampton as they now
are from Brisbane.... “Hal.” : It’s not “The poor ye
shall have always with you,” which is a prophecy, but
“ the poor always ye have with you,” which is a statement
of an existing fact... “The Phairson ” : Many Thanks
“E.F.” (Toowoomba, Q.): Such things are always wel-
come... “C.E.0.”: First enfranchise the men ; they will
enfranchise the women ...“lu liman” (Aramac): We
don’t mind the Chamtion reprinting Bulletin matter
without acknowledgment. Such things deceive nobody,
as all the Western men read The Bulletin “ D.D.”
(Nymagee); Thanks. Photos, how T ever, are unsuitable
for reproduction “Geo. J.” (Upper Cape): Well, it
left this office, anyhow “New- Mug”(S.H.): The re-
hashed “Goosey” yarn appeared in The Bulletin ten
years ago.. .“G.J.” (Capo): So you actually think we
published Dyson’s stockwhip-story as a piece of solemn
history. Heaven help us ! are there such people in Aus-
tralia? “ Jas. I(.” (W.A.): Thanks “Old Scotts-
dale”: Little Pedlington again “ H.K.” (Brts.):
Thanks. Will print “ Boko.”: Try again... “ A.J.M.” :
To enliven the monotony, all such poems should not make
“ wattle” rhyme with “bottle.” [Many replies held
over.]

Mr. FRANK W. MILLS, Abbey Green,

hesitation I thoroughly recommend the Water-

this one nearly three years, hard riding daily, and
yet no difference.”

greatly to my satisfaction, and at such small cost.
This watch I have had for three years. It lias
been an excellent timekeeper, and I would re-
commend anyone wanting an inexpensive watch
to purchase from your company. This is the

Mr. GEO. B. MORRIS, Public School,

in stating that I have had a Waterbury inconstant
use for about seven years, and it has given mo
much satisfaction, being a reliable timekeeper and
standing rough usage. It has been cleaned and
repaired, and upon two or three occasions, never
costing more than 2s. or 2s. Gd. Twice it was

expect it to go for two or three years more.”

Parson A.Webb (Wesleyan, of Brisbane,
Q.): “Across the Dividing Range, and almost in
a world of its own, there is growing up a race,
strong, healthy, energetic, intelligent, but minus
a re'igion. Sunday is marked only by a change of
work, religious services are rare, children are un-
baptised and couples are unmarried. Profanity
taints the air with scarcely a suspicion of its
meaning, and Christ’s name is freely used by men
who do not know who He is.” And yet the
clergy are sending male and female missionaries to
China by every boat. Green fields far off, as usual.
A Berlin newspaper affirms that British
missionaries in Africa carry the Bible in one hand
and a rifle in the other. This is right enough as
far as it goes, and just what The Bulletix has
stated repeatedly. But the German paper has
imperfect information. It omits to mention a
rum-bottle in the other hand. That makes three
hands, certainly, but the average missionary to
the heathen always seems to have about as many
hands as the graven images of the Hindoos, and
as many eyes as Argus. He uses his hands for
Bibles, rum, and rifles, while still having a lot to
grab land with ; and he keeps several of his eyes
on Heaven and the balance on the look-out for
copra and concessions.
A CELEBRATED NOVELIST
CHARLES DICKENS.
This clever novelist was by far the most pc pula*
writer that ever lived in England. Living as he
did at the same time as Thackeray, lie reached a
class of readers whom Thackeray could not touch •
and judged by the mere test of the income derived
from Ins writings, he stands alone. Shakespeare
is consecrated by two centuries and a half of fame
and yet as many people buy Dickens as buy
Shakespeare, and for 1 that reads Shakespeare
there are 10 that read Dickens. The truth is that
Dickens had a Shakespeare power of creation
modernised; his characters have a newness, a
vividness, a naturalness that commend them at a
glance to all the world. The best of them, such
as Sam Weller, and that every-day character Mr.
Pecksniff, have more than this; they have that
truthfulness which makes the reader look upon
them not as characters in a novel but as human
beings.
It must be admitted that Dickens was the first
to bring home with anything like convincing force
to the minds of Londoners the incessant flow of
tragedy and comedy which was going on around
them, and he accomplished this by presenting to
the world his life portraits in simple printer's ink,
framed in language that could not fail to impress.
His “Oliver Twist” did more than a thousand
police reports, aided by the propaganda of all the
charitable organisations of London, to show the
tragedy of life in the great city. “Pickwick,”
despite its delightful exaggeration, was true in
showing the absurdities and elements cf happy
comedy that everyday life may present us with.
These are, perhaps, the reasons of Dickens’s suc-
cess, and to have succeeded as he did stamps the
man as most remarkable. We need not discuss
the question whether his writings will be read a
century hence. But there can be no doubt that
the fame of St. Jacobs Oil will survive even that
of the great novelist, and its praises will le
sounded so long as it continues to rank, as it now
does, as the natural exterminator of rheumatism,
gout, neuralgia, sciatica, and other kindred com-
plaints. For burns, sprains, aches, internal pains,
bruises, cramps, and cuts it stands without an
equal in the world, as thousands upon thousands
daily testify.

The English and Australian Mortgage Bank (in
liauidaliou) seems likely to get Matthew Davies intohis
worst mess, after all. A meeting of Melbourne victims,
• e depositors, was held last week, and the presiding
victim reminded his brethren that “the bank had bor-
rowed their money, and had failed to pay it back as it
Decanie due. The shareholders decided upon voluntary
liquidation, ant j handed over the sole control of their
funds to three liquidators, each of whom, as a former
manager of the company, had had some responsibility,
however small, in connection with it. There was a most
intricate network in the various Davies companies which
Lhe shareholders would have to unravel.”

The private-arrangement insolvency dodge is
lhe popular Melbourne swindle just at present. You
an’t “do the Block” of that financial Gomorrah nowa-
days without getting shoved over by some wealthy trader
or speculater, who has just wiped out his “call” liabili-
ties with an arrangement of next to nothing in the £.
The possibility of a rich man being able to lose all his
mom y is not seriously entertained in Melbourne. The
modest thousand-pound man can be killed by a bank
i, but the representative shark with fifty times
that cap tal, and two hundred times the other fellow’s
liability, isn’t slaughtered, by long chalks. He is tem-
porarily embarrassed, and doing well.

A certain Sydney limited liability company
inn nieces by advertisement in the daily papers
“the dividend of 10 per cent, per annum” is
now payable. This same company, a few weeks ago, was
unable to pay its creditors, and had to take advantage of
the nefarious Act whereby a “ bank ” is enabled to put off
,i s depositors for three years as they fall due, so that the
depositor whose money doesn’t become payable in the
natural course of events for, say, two years, has no chance
of seeing the last instalment of his cash until 1899. And
how it would be particularly interesting to know if the
framers of the Act, or the Judge who gives his consent to
“arrangements ” effected under it, ever intended that a
“hank” which had to postpone its liabilities in this
fashion should proceed to dissipate its funds in 10 per
cent, dividends while these same liabilities remain un-
paid. If there is nothing in the Act to prevent such a
proceeding then the sooner the statute is amended the
better. This same institution announces that, “The
bank, as agent, is prepared to act for and collect the
dividends on behalf of country investors interested in the
s veral companies which have suspended payment during
the late crisis.” In other words the dog that is sick is
willing, presumably for the customary commission, to
I elp eat the dog that is dead.

The balance-sheet of the Beaumaris (Vic.)
Tramway Co. is about the most surprising document of
its kind we know of. The receipts have steadily diminished
from £398 9s. lOd. in January to £G6 2s. in June. The
“ Bills Receivable” are put among the “Liabilities,” which
seems a novel place for such an item ; and among the
“ Assets ” are “ Cost of accident to date, £420 Is. Id.”
Apparently, therefore, an accident, accompanied by
damage to passengers and plant, is an asset with this
remarkable company, and it seems surprising, consider-
ing how hard up the affair seems to be, that it doesn’t
have one oftener and pay a dividend out of the ruins, or
else put the accident in the bank.

The best plea for an insolvent tradesman to fire
at the court now is that he has been ruined by unsuccess-

tariff, and financially collapsed having lost everything
“ in his effort to do his little share in helping along the
commercial progress of the colony.”

More sensational yields from the great Lear-
month mine at Egerton (Vic.). Martin Loughlin and
several big Ballarat men owe their present immensity to
this phenomenal claim. Martin and Bailey and a few
more, got hold of lire mine cheap whilst the Learmonths
were working it at a loss, and almost immediately struck
a shoot of gold of extraordinary richness. The Learmonths
tried to recover the property on the presumption that
their manager knew of this gold much earlier, and kept it
dark till the purchase of the mine could be arranged, and
an historical fight ensued. The syndicate’s bargain held
good in the Courts, and its members got away with a
small mountain of gold that lias enabled them to own Cup
winners and live “ right up to the gilded knocker ” ever
since.

Little Beyers still pegs away at Hill End.
How much of the big fortune he made out of the field
has gone back into it? Nearly a quarter of a century
ago, Beyers, after being deserted by his mates, struck a
patch and came to Sydney to sell some 300 ozs. gold. He
stayed at the European Hotel, in Castlereagh-street,
an old miners’ rendezvous. Holfermann was a waiter
there, and complained to Beyers of his wages, 10s. per
week. Beyers agreed to take him back with him to Hill
End, where they w'orked as mates. Kesult, Holtermann
made £70,000 and Beyers nearly £60,000. Holtermann
got the lion’s share because he plunged into everything
and rode successfully out on the maddening boom which
followed,
# # *
Mark Hammond, the innocent victim of the
Last Call swindle—the “mine,” wo see, is still at work—
also made his big money in Beyers and Holtermann’s
maim. He was boss for Northumberland Jimmy, who
lent him £5OO to buy an eighth interest. He had an idea
tna,t the rich run of gold then being worked in Jimmy’s
claim could he picked up in Beyers and Holtermann’s.
it Was many months before he could get the two little
Germans to work where he wanted, hut after repeated ill-
■uck elsewhere he at last succeeded, and then followed

Rich specimens fascinate the public less than
formerly. Three years ago such displays as those from
the Hargreaves mine, near Mudgee, would have sent the
shares to a pound in a few days. Now the stock remains
stationary at about 7s. This is a satisfactory indication
that at last the N.S.W. public has cut its “eyeteeth”
in mining. After all, the mine doesn’t seem so rich as
some people would have us think. Seventy-five ozs. from
three tons of stone, including a big heap of specimens, is
not a sensational result. Many years back the field was
distinguished for its rich patches. It is a pure gamble-
impossible to say whether the shares are worth £7OOO,
seven shillings, seven pounds, or seven pence.

The liquidation of that miserably insignificant
N.S.W. tin-mine called Lode Hill still crawls on. It has
been months before “the Master,” and is now before the
Equity Judge. We quite expect yet to see it before the
Full Court, the Privy Council, and Parliament. All over
what?-as to whether the contributing or paid-up share-
holders should pay the liability, £5OO, an amount already
eaten up in a thousand legal expenses. The point, too,
without legal enlargements, is as simple as AB C. The
written contract contains no consideration tor the holding
ofpaid-upshares. Question —was there any consideration —
in other words, did or did not the original owners of the
lease receive paid-up shares for transferring it to the Co. <j

The Earl of Hopetoun mine, Hillgrove, has
been sold by tender for £2200 to the Earl of Hopetoun
South Co.- a sad ending to all the booming. Long ere it
began crushing, the mine reached a market-value of
£200,000. To this end the Arqcs largely contributed by
the publication of laudatory articles. Money was lavished
in new machinery and in other directions. Dividends
were foreshadowed but calls were made instead. Mel-
bourne shareholders laughed when warned by disin-
terested N.S.W, mining men, who are now enjoying their
little smile.
* * *
It is said of the United Bluey that, owing to the
fineness of the gold and its association with pyrites, only
some 12dwts. can be obtained from 2oz. stone. Sheer
nonsense. The hope of dividends is delusive if centred in
anything but the proved value of the lode. When will
N.S.W. shareholders cease to nurse the fallacy that for-
tunes are withheld because of wasted gold?
* * *
It is a fair assumption that upwards of a million
has been expended in “prospecting votes” in Australia.
It is the administration of the vote which damns it. It is
exhausted in sinking pot-holes on the surface, or in
slightly deepening others, in driving in barren ground-
in fraud and deception. Of it, said to us an English
mining representative: “ I find men offering to sell their
mines with the ‘Govt, aid’ included in the contract!”
Will it not be universally admitted that had any of the
Govts, spent, say, £lOO,OOO in the founding of a State
Mining College, with extensive metallurgical works, the
money would have been well spent?

It is said that the returns of ore sent to Germany
by Faulkner’s mine, Pambula, were “ very unsatisfactory.”
They did not correspond with locally-made assays. They
seldom do. It is as easy to make a mistake in assaying as
in treatment. How, too, did the Co. arrive at the state-
ment that there was exactly 1898 tons of ore at grass?

how it is proposed to raise auriferous wash-dirt from

in actual practice. Therefore, we advise the promoters to
cease pumping out of a bucket and commence pumping
out of a river.

Dear Bulletin, —Allow me, as a Melbourne
resident, to flatly contradict the assertion that there
is any re-action in Munro’s favour. All the capital
of the Real Estate Bank had to be called up because it is
all gone, and the trouble for depositors is that there isn’t
enough capital to call for. The liquidators are not put-
ting on any screw. They were prepared to give Munro
time, just as they have had to give time to other people,
but he never at tempted to make any terms with them,
lie remained in England and shut his ears to the voice of
the caller, and to talk of “ political intrigue” putting the
screw on this unblushing old political intriguer is too
absurd.—F.

The treatment of ores by the M'Arthur-Forrest
process of cyanide of potassium is a success of the age,
and £500,000 has been paid for the American rights.
Agents are now in Australia. It requires two per cent,
of cyanide to the ton, but the chemical is saved for re-use.
It places gold in solution without roasting as required in
the ordinary form of chlorination, thus reducing the cost
of treatment. It is being extensively used in Russia, Africa,
and America. The presence of copper is, however, a dis-
ability, consequently, while a success at Charters Towers,
it is a failure at Croydon.

Sydney (N.S.W.) owns the champion

Clark, of Surry Hills, awoke, she found that the
hubby of her bosom had been chloroformed, his
hands tightly bound, and his neck tied up to the

And gallant burglars force her door,
They don’t disturb her gentle sleeping,
But fix her hub., and let her snore.
Premier Griffith, having failed in his
attempt to frighten the Bananaland Assembly by
threatening that if it didn’t pass his Three-in-
One Bill, the British Government would grant
two distinct territorial separations, proceeded to
accommodate himself to a majority adjustment, so
as to keep himself on top. Believing that most
noses can be counted in favour of amendments
limiting the number of the sub-provinces to two —
North and South —Griffith has promised not to
oppose Barlow’s amendment to that effect. As
the Central District membership numbers only
11 all told—and as one Central man (Norton) is
Speaker, a second (Archer) is in England, and a
third (Pattison) is sick, leaving only eight effective
votes, three of which are opposed to the whole
Bill—in a House consisting of 72 members,
Griffith can afford to chance the new risk. All
the same, he is not likely to get his patchwork
Provincial Bill passed by this Parliament. The
next Parliament also is certain not to tackle it
until its third year, because its acceptance would
be in itself an act of immediate suicide.
J. H. Geddes & Co., The Pastoral Finance
Association, Ltd., report : —From recent advices
we expect very shortly to have a large assortment
of the new season’s clip, though only a small
quantity comparatively will be available for
immediate sale, the larger portion being held for
the competition of the over-sea buyers at opening
sales about 26th September. Latest returns show
that wools sold at last London series come out
generally at a small loss as compared with prices
obtainable locally at time of shipping from this
port; this, with the increased attendance of
buyers advised, will, without doubt, lead to a
large increase in the Sydney offerings. From
private information we understand that additional
large orders are coming to this market and this
should also be an important factor in deciding
wool growers to offer here.
It is most convenient to have, a first-class
room near tram stopping places, wdiere ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

“ Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Rarns-
den’s case is the most wonderful, and his remedies cured him
in six weeks, after mn y Sydney doctors gave l.i n up. We
may also state that a gentleman in this district, who has
been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several “doctors” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long life to continue his useful mission in the
cause of suffering humanity.”—Kangaroo Valley Pioneer,

My Dear Doctor,—
I feel grateful to you for your advice to try the
remedies extracted from New Zealand plants, and
prepared by the Rev. Mother Mary Joseph
Aubert. I have used them for some time, and I
am in a position to inform you that I have found
them perfectly satisfactory. They are really tonic
and fortifying.
Be good enough to convey to the Rev. Mother
mv congratulations on her labours ; they are of
great value for the relief of human miseries, and
appear to me capable of furthering colonial
industry, and should at the same time be profit-
able to those good works which she seeks to
realise.
Accept, my dear doctor, the assurance of my
appreciative feelings,
(Signed) ONSLOW.

RESUSCITATION.
Everyone who has been attacked with the
prevailing epidemic of Influenza, knows that it is
very lowering to the system, and that a general
feeling of weakness permeates all through the
body.
Now, it is highly necessary that some Tonic
Medicine should be taken to bring the system up
to its proper standard, because, if not immediately
attended to, more serious complaints may develop,
and cause a large amount of unnecessary misery.
His Excellency Lord Onslow has communicated
the fact to Mother Mary Joseph Aubert that the
remedy, Karana, as prepared by herself, is, in his
opinion, and front his own experience in taking
same, a perfect tonic and very fortifying, and the
public may rest assured that the Governor of this
Colony would not give such testimony unless he
was well aware that it was correct.
Those persons who are troubled with a Cough,
as an after effect from influenza, are particularly
requested to give Marupa a fair trial, and it will
be found that benefit will result.
It may be as well to mention here that these
Remedies are not cheap and nasty preparations,
but are made up in such concentrated form that
they may, at first sight, appear expensive, but
this is not so, as, from the very many flattering
testimonials which have been received, the pro-
prietor is confident that value is being given, and
that only good results follow with those persons
who have given the Remedies a trial.
No medicines previously introduced into New
Zealand have reached a total sale of eighteen
thousand bottles in four months, and yet this has
been done by Mother Mary Joseph Aubert.
Kindly remember’that Karana is invigorating
to the system, and that Marupa will successfully
combat with any Cold, Cough or Bronchial
Affection.

BUSHRANGING & OUTLAWRY
IN AUSTRALASIA.
( FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Beginnings of Bushranging.
By PRICE WAEUNG.
The first criminal court in the colony was
assembled on the 11th February, 1788, four days
after formal proclamation of his Government had
been made by Phillip. The theft for food was the
principal offence inquired into, and thus early
in our history the prime motive for so many bush-
ranging outbreaks began to operate. One of the
food-stealers was sentenced to “a week’s confine-
ment, on bread and water, on a small, rocky
island near the entrance to the cove.” The virgin
Pinchgut was thereby introduced to the know-
ledge of British penal methods, and its career of
usefulness initiated. But the tenant of the island,
then pyramidal in aspect, was not so fortunate as
another offender (one James Barrett, 16 years old)
similarly charged at the next court held a fortnight
after. The latter was hanged the very day of sen-
tence, the philosophical Phillip doubtless conclud-
ing that a good business cannot be too soon
terminated, and besides—a day’s ration would be
saved by immediate execution ! The hangman,
James Freeman, was a criminal condemned at the
same time, and he merits some circumstantiality
of notice. Sentenced at Hereford on 3rd March,
1784, to seven years’ transportation, he, on this
red-letter day, saved his neck by officiating as
executioner and acting as accoucheur to that lusty
and long-lived babe, the Australian Gallows !
In another of his sentences passed the same
eventful day, the Governor was, however, less
considerate of the fortunes of the offenders. He
condemned three men (besides Barrett and Free-
man) to death, but reprieved them in order to send
them to South Cape “ when the season permitted
them to be landed.” Here, then, wo have the
origin of “taking to the bush.” It was an official
proceeding. The mercy which reprieved the poor
wretches was of the questionable kind. It simply
meant, as things were, condemning them to a
more lingering death.
# # #
That is, had they gone. But they were
never consigned to the destined spot of exile. The
South Cape (though Rusden, the historian, does
not seem to be aware of it) was, of course, the
South Cape of what is now Tasmania. Bass and
Flinders, twin-heroes, had not yet discovered
“the existence of a wide opening between Van
Dieman’s Land and N.5.W.,” and therefore the
Cape was thought to be the Southern extremity
of New Holland. Phillip, in his sentence, doubt-
less anticipated that a vessel of the “ First Fleet ”
would return by the Southern route and land the
doubly-exiled souls. It is certain the Sirius did
not take them on her voyage to the Cape of Good
Hope for supplies, and the other ships took the
northward passage to Batavia and China. What
became of them? And what became of the
Governor’s idea in thus ordering them into exile?
The ingenious Rusden —would that we could say
ingenuous ! —suppresses his Excellency’s naive
reason. “They shall be landed near the South
Cape,” Phillip wrote to Lord Sydney, “ where by
them forming connections with the natives, some
benefits maj' accrue to the public.” One does not
know which to admire the more—Phillip’s simple
solicitude fer aboriginal interests, or his tender
regard for the ever-to-be-regarded “ public.”
Hope herself, whom the poet Darwin fabled had
visited Botany Bay, could scarcely have antici-
pated any notable advantages from an intimacy
between hungry biscuit-thieves and the children
of nature. As she
. . stood sublime and waved her golden hair,
Calmed with her rosy smile the tossing deep,
And with sweet accents dreamed the winds to sleep,
she uttered no words audible to the poet, pro-
phetic of the blessings to be mutually conferred
by the banished three and the natives of the
“Southward.”
If South Cape was not to receive the exiles,
Pinchgut, so emphatically designated by the
transports, did. Their voyage to “ parts un-
known ” ended at the “rocky pyramid,” but,
unlike their predecessor, there was stated no limit
to their term of banishment. It lasted, however,
till June. None of their names have come
officially down to us, and we have to illuminate
the period by private testimony, from which we
learn that oneof the three was John Caesar, or Cesar,
born in Jamaica, West Indies, and sentenced at
Maidstone, Kent, to be transported for seven
years. But before we relate the colonial doings of
the first of the jbushranerers, we must give an
account of our witness. He is not a very credit-
able witness, we confess, but we think we can
believe him on particulars unconnected with his
own affairs. As to them, he was really a bold, if
not a brilliant, liar.
* * *
Michael Robinson is his name, (lifted with
a terrible itch for scribbling for the press, he was
also an accomplished penman in other directions,
and the irregular exercise of his peculiar talents
in his vocation of an attorney had occasioned, in
1798, his banishment to Botany Bay for the term
of his natural life. On his arrival he was per-
mitted to practise in the curiously constituted
courts of the time, and therefore became, in Mr.
Commissioner Bigge’s words, “a person of some
celebrity.” As clerk to the Judge-Advocate, he
also performed a useful and profitable service to
society, and he might have risen to wealth and pre-
ferment if he could have controlled his tongue and
pen. But in 1802 he transgressed the law once
more, and was distinguished by a vice-regal Pro-
clamation. The text of the body of that docu-
ment we give, not merely for The reason that it
has never previously been printed ,in full, but
because Governor King’s Spartan method of deal-
ing with the “ misleaders ” of Justice shows that
he could communicate “ a wrinkle or two ” to our
rulers to-day. The procedure, nowadays, “In rc
Gent, one,” &c., lacks, it must be confessed, the
directness of the second year of the century. This
is the general order
Head Quarters, 17th. Sept. 1802.
Michael Robinson—A convict for life and conditionally
emancipated, acting as clerk to the Judge-Advocate and
Magistrates, having been convicted on the clearest
evidence, before His Excellency when sitting as JiuLe of
the Court of Appeals, of wilfull and corrupt perjury,
evidently intended to mislead the Governor’s decision to
the manifest injury of one of the parties in the appeal
then before him, and otherways perverting the epurse of
’the said Michael Robinson being sentenced by His
Excellence During the sitting of the said Court of Appeals
and by virtue of the statutes provided on that behalf to
he transported for seven years to Norfolk Island, at hard
labour.
On this occasion the Governor considers it necessary to
say he has had frequent occasion to think this infamous
practice has been often resorted to in this colony tor the
worst of purposes - that of screening guilty persons from
the punishments which the law directs to be inflicted on
offenders ; and, as a caution to those who may he lead or
advised to commit a crime so destructive to society and
the administration of justice, ho is determined to bring
every offender of that description to the most condign
punishment which the law authorises.
And as it appeared in the above appeal that a gallon of
rum had been most unjustifiably and oppressively de-
manded as a fee to the delivery of a bail bond,
The Governor judges it necessary that the cost attend-
ing civil actions should be published for the information
of every person under his command, and to require that
every other demand should be resisted
Hereto is annexed the schedule, which need not be
now quoted.
* # #
To Norfolk Island Michael Robinson went
accordingly, and Sydney did not know him again
for a year or so. He lamented his fate, but we
must say he merited it. As a satirist has said of
another and still more distinguished lawyer :
To do him justice : short and rare
His wish through honest paths to roam ;
Born with a taste for the unfair,
When falsehood called he still was there,
And when least honest most at home.
Robinson was not improperly sent to the Island,
even then deserving the title conferred upon it at
a later day, of “the Gehenna of the Waters.”
There he was treated with leniency, and—fortu-
nately for us—began the keeping of the diary.
The journal lies before us as we write. The paper
is various: the earlier pages are mere scraps
apparently torn off official documents, and it was
not until he had been writing three months that
he is enabled, by an unpardonable theft from the
stores, to obtain nine sheets of cartridge-paper.
We denounce the theft, although perhaps as an
historian we should look lightly upon it, for it has
preserved for us a few curious things. We hold
the offence was inexcusable, inasmuch as he
devoted three sheets of the nine to “ An Ode to
the King.” Think of the benighted state of that
creature who, surrounded by over a hundred men
and women, each with a sad story to tell, devoted
the precious sheets to eulogising poor old Farmer
George! Convict Robinson guilty of perjury
merely ? He should have been indicted rather for
a fraud upon posterity ! To possess the golden
chance of preparing what De Goncourt calls “a
human document,” and to devote the opportunity
to —a King !
* * *
Thus strummed Michael in his opening verse:—
Oh, George, thy lofty brow still wears
The glorious grace of years !
And still the lustre of thy Crown
Reflects the wond’ring world’s renown ;
. And still the cliffs that guard thy const
Are Freedom’s bulwarks, Nature’s boast!
And so on for fifty lines. We may not print
more ; and we quote these chiefly to enable us to
remark that, with “ lofty ” changed to “silver’d,”
and witli “ venerable ” substituted for “glorious,”
the identical passage above given appears in the
same author’s “Ode on His Majesty’s Birthday of
1818.” The latter was one of a long published
series which secured the praise of Macquarie, by
whom Robinson bad been granted a free pardon
in 1811. We wonder whether Macquarie would
have continued to patronise the “votary of the
Antipodean muse,” as the poet-forger styled him-
self, had he known that his protege was repeating
in his later eulogies of the Royal virtues the results
of his earlier liaison with the sisters of song !
Now, in moments of reflection, Robinson had
other aspirations than those which prompted him
to weave “ poetic laurels round regal brows.” He
sighed in his island retreat for the unrestricted
freedom of the “unguarded denizen of the woods.”
“ If,” he ventured to put down on his cartridge-
paper, “ I once more set my fdot in Sydney Cove ”
—he stumbled in his prose as he did in his verse—
“and do not meet with justice. . . I will see
whether the minions of Power shall despitefully
abuse me. Have I no other means of redress, I
register my vow to head ” —the word in the MS.
may be “ lead ” —“ a rebellion. These are times
to make tyrants tremble.” And then he goes on
to refer to a story told him by. as it happens, one
of the Exiled Three, of the escapades of John
Caesar. “That negro man,” he insnbordinately
comments, “was nobler than the Minion of
Royallty”—he is prodigious, is our poet, in the use
of “Minion,” and has liberal views as to the
spelling of royalty, “ who ordered him from the
town.” Quite a terrific gasconader on his sheets
of cartridge, was Michael—the first of Australia’s
poets ; but, without doubt, a very contemptible
lick-spittle in actual intercourse with the
“Minions of Pow’r.” Foveaux, the rum-bibbing
soldier, with a penchant for hanging convicts and
flogging soldiers without trial, was Lient.-Governor
at Norfolk Island during our poet’s residence
there, and Mr. Robinson supplies us with infor-
mation as to how his Honor treated him.
“ Walked with his Honor to Anson’s Bay ” is a
note referring to a two-days’ excursion from the
Settlement at Sydney Bay, “ and his Honor was
pleased to say he had been much delighted with
my company. ’ A very turtle-dove of a rebel this
—with the great heart of him beating to his
nation’s wrongs, and venting its agony in
melodious pipings for the pleasure of Foveaux,
the inventor of branding-irons for convicts ! The
poor, black, semi-brute Caesar would have shown
himself a more valiant spirit.
» # #
And now to get back to the “ first of the bush-
rangers ” —John Caesar, whom we are now able to
identify, with Michael Robinson’s aid, as one of
the “banished three,” and with the Caesar of
Collins. Restored to the mainland on the 4th
June, 1788, by an act of mercy on Phillip’s part,
in commemoration of his Gracious Majesty’s
birthday—decidedly a better way of recognition
than the bestowal of a C.M.G.-ship—Caesar, it
would appear, was assigned as servant to an
officer. The settlement was in a starving condi-
tion, and, in spite of Phillip’s fair-minded desire
that all (officers, soldiers, convicts) should share
and share alike in the distribution of rations, it is
reasonable to suppose that the ignorant black,
despised for his colour by greater criminals than
himself, often dined with Duke Humphrey.
Whether the fact was so or not, Caesar preferred
to run the risk of starvation “ in the woods ” than
to continue starving in the hutted town. He
absconded, taking with him “ a musket, an iron
pot, and some provisions,” and for some months
subsisted on (lie spoils of Ins rude hunting, some-
times on the fruits of midnight thefts on outlying
patches of civilisation. Tin n, in May, 1789, soon
after the return of the Sirius with a cargo of flour
from the Cape, he was caught. Collins estimated '
Caesar at “no more than a remove from the
brute,” but there was something more than
brutish cunning in his consenting to be re-captured
just as the granaries were re filled. It may be
that, as in the case of some criminals of these
latter days, the Authorities were not anxious for
his return, but, having captured him, and “as the
idea of death seemed to have no effect on his
mind,” the Governor ordered him to be kept at
work in fetters on Garden Island in the Harbour.
On Garden Island,* then, and for long years
afterwards, a lustrous gem of natural beauty, but,
at the time of present writing, the most art-
damned spot on earth, this rogue Caesar worked
so as to secure the remission of his irons. Then,
writes the historian, “with a mind insensible
alike to kindness and punishment,” lie made his
escape in a canoe, in which the other people work-
ing on the island went to and from their labour.
In the canoe was a week’s provisions. And that
injury was not the only one he inflicted upon his
co-workers. “ A few nights after he made a visit
in the canoe and took off an iron-pot, a musket
and some ammunition.” A plucky, if sinful
fellow, this Caesar, with a fibre of strength in him
that was absent from, say Michael Robinson, who
yet lived to be honoured of “ the Minions of
Pow’r.”
* * *
That was the first notable exploit of the
first bushranger. A paltry deed, no doubt, com-
pared with the Eugowra Escort robbery, or the
sticking-up of the Bank of N.S.W., at Euroa, but
as things were, an old flintlock and a canoe con-
stituted “ a big haul.” And, for six years did
this brutish black prove a pest and a terror to the
new colony. Piecing, bit by bit, tradition with
MS record and printed paper, we can see in this
hunted scoundrel an audacity and ingenuity of
resource that were surpassed by few later ruffians
of the road. And, by Michael Robinson’s help,
we will tell you later how he harried an embryo
Empire.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
In answer to a correspondent, The Bulletin
has to say that when “ Adam Bede ” (the original Adam
Bede long ago sold out of the sweep bearing his name)
first started opetations in Sydney and undertook to hand
over to charity a percentage of the profits made by his
business, this paper did encourage the public to patronise
his consultation, the drawings of which W’ere then wit-
nessed (they may lie now, for all we know) by reliable and
representative people. When, however, “Adam Bede”
withdrew Ids contributions to the charities, The Bul-
letin more than once notified in its columns that its
blessing had been withdrawn from the concern, about the
operations of which it has ever since known no more
than it does about the private opinions of the Emperor
of China.
• # #
Tom Piieasant, in whom the world appears just
now to see the coming middleweight champion, made
easy work of defeating Hetfernan, but no criterion can be
taken from that fight as to what he will do higher up the
pugilistic ladder, for it must not be forgotten that Heffer-
nan fell just as easily before Jim Ryan. Should Pheasant
and Creedon meet, in the writer’s opinion, Pheasant is
just the style of man for Creedon to beat right out of
hand. “ Devil ” is all very well in a boxer, but Pheasant
has a bit too much of it, as he goes raving mad when
struck. Creedon is hardly the style of man to stand
off and allow Pheasant to “pink” him with the left, and
when Pheasant comes to “mixing it” with a cool, scien-
tific, hard-hitting man, he will go to the wall. Pheasant
appears to glory in giving punishment, but he has yet to
show how he will take it, and, as a rule, the fiery steed is
not the best to answer under the whalebone.
» # *
The public don’t go to boxing-matches to see a
man in a fit of ungovernable rage trying to pulverise his
opponent, and when this sort of thing occurs the police
should at once stop the fight, which is then no longer a
manly and scientific exhibition. The truly plucky man
feels pity for every blow he is compelled to strike a beaten
opponent. George Dawson, for whom everyone has a
good word, is a pattern all boxers might well copy. Brave
as a lion, he takes his punishment without flinching, and,
as the American papers remarked, when his opponent is
beaten Dawson’s consideration is such that he almost
appeals to the defeated man’s seconds to take him away
and save any actual knock-out.
# # #
At last week's races at Epsom (Melb.) a fine
feat of horsemanship was performed by Mr. F. D. Brewer,
one of the well-known Victorian family of cross-country
riders. In the Hunters’ Steeplechase his mount, Cornet,
fell five fences from home. Mr. Brewer remounted on
the off-side, secured the reins after the horse was once
more going, and, though he once struck heavily on a
fence, overtook the other horses and won on the post. At
the last Brewer had the use of neither reins nor stirrups,
the former being crossed and one of the latter slung
across the horse’s back. Enthusiastic cheers greeted the
performance.
• * *
A word to the Cruelty to Animals Prevention
people. If a man who makes bread and beef by hawking
crawls round town with a lame horse in his cart, he is
duly “ run in.” On the racecourse, a wealthy owner may
gallop a horse, which limps on to the course on three leg-,
at its hardest for a mile without any sign from the society.
* * •
Dan. Creedon is a better fighter than referee,
thi Saturday night he umpired the fight between Cbiddy
Ryan and Alex. Stuart, and upon Ryan deliberately
throwing Stuart in the sixth round, the latter refused to
go on fighting, when the referee gave (he fight to Ryan.
Stuart objected, when Creedon reversed his decision and
gave Stuart the fight on the foul. This he undid, and l lie
men divided the stakes. Poor Jack Thompson was the
only tip-top referee Sydney lias yet turned out.

Last week The Bulletin suggested that Free-

chase if the Millers didn’t run their crack against him.
But Redlcap was brought out, and lie won as a matter of
course, the handsome Maorilander finishing third only.
H ith a sound top to the sandy course there was no chance
for anything to heat Redlenp, a horse that can go faster,
carry more weight, and perhaps jump better than any
two ordinary 'chaser cracks knocked into one. The Mel-
bourne people shook off some of their prevailing depres-
sion on Saturday, when the “dead birds," Tim S.vlVeller

saddles were removed from the equities outside the .South
Eastern Hotel, Mt. Gambier, the pony’s boss refused to

A GIANT ATHLETE—FROM UP NORTH.
ANDREWS' TIP.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
If you’ve only met Dick Andrews you may think him a
good sort,
But, take my advice, be careful, if you ask him about
sport;
And, although lie backs some duffers and non-triers it is
true,
He is mostly on the right side, for lie knows a thing or
two.
When he knows it lie won’t tell it-—no, he thinks Twould
spoil his luck;
What he backs is often home first, what lie tell* stays in
the ruck.
1 hid learnt his little weakness—he was tight and let it
slip—
“ Alf., you know old Harry Wilson—well, he asked me
for a lip.”
And he put him on to stiff-'uiis—bookies’ mokes that
wouldn’t w in—
Add he laughed with drunken pb asnre at how poor old
Hal fell in.
Still, 1 didn’t think he’d have me - I had worked with him
so long
Though 1 knew, when asked, he in s’ly put the men who
asked him w rong.
Out at Raudwick —’twas last Easier-1 had played my
money up,
And f heard a stable told him a real good thing for the
Cup.
The price was short on Highborn, and I couldn’t stand
Strathmore,
So 1 thought I’d go and ask a thing I’d neverdone before.
“Dick,” said I, “my luck is frightful- I’ve not had a
single win
Come now, tell me what you fancy this time to about get
in.”
So he told me. as a secret, lie had got the office straight—
“ But your money on Stroinholi-go on now, before it’s
lute I”
And 1 took my only sovereign-twenty-fives, the odds
looked big.
“ Never mind,” said honest Andrews, we are bound to get
a jig.” .
Then he left me, but I watched him in amongst the
bookies glide ;
I was bad the paltry latcal put bis fiver on Oxide.
Then the Hag fell, on they galloped (Greygown was away
behind);
1 was bent on plugging Andrews, but no Andrews could I
find.
’Twas a shabby trick to play me who had been so long his
mate,
Bat 1 missed him till the horses came careering down the
straight.
And the crowd yelled, “ Strathmore’s nowhere!” “Jack
is finished I” “ Selkirk’s dead !”
Every jock, was at it flogging, every trier had its head.
“Highborn's coming!” “No! s.'C Oxide.” “What,
Stromboli has the race !”
Then you should have seen the pallor and the rage on
Andrews’ face.
Yes, 'twas right, 1 got the money, lip came Dick—“ I ,
told v on so I”
“ Ves, jon're a white man,” I answered. “ All the same,
now-,! Andrews, ;/o-
tio and draw jour stuff on Oxide, lie'll paj on the totes
to-night:
You were pretty fly, old fellow, hut the tip has turned out
right. '
And remember for the future that the flyest push fall in,
And although you’re pretty clever, those you don't back
sometimes win I”

The Overflow of Clancy.
(On reading the Banjo's “ Clancy of the Overflow.")
I’ve read “The Banjo’s” letter, and I’m glad lie’s
found a better
Billet than lie had upon the station where I met
him years ago ;
lie was “ slushy ” then for Scotty, but the “ bush-
land ” sent him “ dotty,”
So he “ rose up, William Kiley,” and departed
down below.
He “rolled up” very gladly, for lie had bush-
fever badly
When he left “ the smoke ” to wander “where
the wattle-blossoms wave,”
But a course of “ stag and brownie ” seems to make
the bush-struck towny
Kinder weaken on the wattle and the bushman’s
lonely grave.
Safe in town, he spins romances of the bush until
one fancies
That it’s all top-boots and chorus, kegs of rum
and “whips”of grass,
And the sheep off camp go stringing when the
“ boss-in-charge ” is singing,
Whilst we “ blow the cool tobacco-smoke and
watch the white wreaths pass.”
Yet, I guess “ The B.” feels fitter in a b'iled shirt
and “ hard-hitter ”
Than he would “way down the Cooper” in a
flannel smock and “ moles,”
For the city cove has leisure to indulge in stocks
of pleasure,
But the drover’s only pastime’s cooking “ I Vhat’s
this! on the coals.’-’
And the pub. hath friends to meet him, and
between the acts they treat him
While he’s swapping "fairy twisters” with the
“ girls behind their bars,”
And he sees a vista splendid when the ballet is
extended,
And at night he’s in his glory with the comic-
op’ra stars.
• •••••*
I am sitting, very weary, on a log before a dreary
Little fire that’s feebly hissing ’neath a heavy
fall of rain,
And the wind is cold and nipping, and I curse the
ceaseless dripping
As I slosh around for wood to start the embers
up again.
And, in place of beauty’s greeting, I can hear the
dismal bleating
Of a ewe that’s sneaking out among the marshes
for her lamb;
And for all the poet’s skitin’ that a new-chum
takes delight in,
The drover’s share of pleasure isn’t worth a
tinker’s d n.
Does he sneer at bricks and mortar when he’s
squatting in the water
After riding fourteen hours beneath a sullen,
weeping sky ?
Does he look aloft and thank it, as he spreads his
sodden blanket ?
For the drover has no time to spare, he has no
time to dry.
If “ The Banjo’s ” game to fill it, he is .welcome to
my billet;
He can “take a turn at droving ” —wages three-
and-six a-day—
And his throat’ll get more gritty than mine will in
the city
Where with Mister Lawson’s squashes I can
wash the dust away.

The energetic and clever Phillip Mennell

Courier and the Telegraph are concocted.
Beyond the staffs, no one occupies them except

“It is to be noted that there are certain
people who never use the word ‘ constitutional ’

taken to printing the word “damn” occasionally,
and is otherwise growing quite dreadful.
E. H. Tayl r, lately released from Dar-
linghurst prison, left for America by the ’Frisco
mail-boat. Some relatives of his lately arrived
from England, and while staying with them after
his discharge a case of small-pox occurred in the
liouse where they resided. Taylor and his friends
therefore had to go to quarantine, where they
stayed until just before the departure of the
Yankee mail.
Unless Trades Unionism is to fall into
well-merited disrepute, the Boiler-makers Society
had better settle the award given by its own court
of arbitration against itself, over the Bancoora
affair. Roberts’ original claim having been
reduced from =£37<i Ids. to .£ll5, on the contention
that but 23 of the ironworkers involved belonged
to the Union, it is mere equivocation to assert
that the men as individuals, and not the society as
a whole, are responsible. If the Union is not able
to control its members, it had better disband.
The Bancoora trouble occured six months ago.
Overlander Buchanan is said to relate
that lie was once returning to Queensland
from the Northern Territory of S.A., and
was scared to find that two known water-
holes, on which he had relied, were abso-
lutely dry. There were now 40 miles of sandy
desert between Buchanan and water. As he sat,
Jonah-like, in the shade of a coolibah-tree, he
noticed that a crow perched overhead, and began
to caw prophetically for his eyes. The bird of ill-
omen proved the bnsliman’s salvation. Rummag-
ing his larder, he threw several chunks of “salt-
horse” to a convenient, distance and watched.
The crow ate the dinner provided him, and, when
satisfied, again rested his gorged body on a limb
of the tree. Presently, the salt victuals did their
work and the crow flew off. Buchanan followed
on his weary horse, and found an unsuspected
waterholo and a clump of green timber.

Her Little Boomerang.
A Warning to Tailor-made Wires,
(F OR THE BULLETIN.)
Mrs. Smith was a fashionable, pretty
woman wlio would have named her children
Klcuo or Myrtle, or Montmorenci, if she had had
any. I know of no clearer way to describe her.
She was addicted to tailor-made gowns and quiet
musings on the beach. A married woman who is
given to musing on the beach is in danger of hell-
fire, according to tiie creed of the Young Women’s
Christian Association ; but Mrs. S. did not
belong to the Y.W.C. A., and her entire creed was
tador-made. To those desirous of a nice, quiet
place for a comfortable murder, or a proposal, or
some such rash action, permit me to recommend
the beach at Sandringham, Vic. That is where
Mrs. Smith was accustomed to muse, and that is
where she was musing on a recent sunny morning.
She had expressed her belief that the wicked eye
of man could not reach her there, by having
seated herself in a careless position which tip-
tiited the hem of her tailor-made skirt, and
exposed more old-gold stocking than fashionable
ladies usually divulge—by about half a-yard.
This is woman's most comfortable attitude.
In the midst of her musings, Mrs. Smith
casually looked up, and then suddenly and
dexterously lowered a tailor-made veil over the
hosiery department, and snugged her ankles
away back in the shelter of her petticoats.
Which signified that she had seen a man. Then,
serenely virtuous and satisfied that she was re-
vealing nothing calculated to bring a blush to the
cheek of the most conscious woman in the world,
she began to speculate. First came the uncom-
forting reflection that he might have a telescope—
she had heard that men at the seaside occasionally
carried such things, and a telescope in the hands
of a strange man—or almost any man, for that
matter —who might have been watching her for
half an hour, was an embarrassing point to con-
sider. Then she thought it might be her husband
—and was inclined to prefer the telescope. Finally,
she concluded that if the worst came to the worst
she could tell him she was married. She could
also have got away home before he came near her,
but apparently that way out of the difficulty did
not occur to her.
As he came closer her woman’s heart went eight
beats to the bar, for she saw that he was young
and impudently good-looking. Then Virtue came
to her aid once more and reminded her that she
was a wife, so she put her wedding-ring in her
pocket. Some women there are who delight to
flaunt the holy ties of matrimony in the face of
the world, but Mrs. Smith was too young and
tailor-made to care to take such unladylike liberties
with so secret a subject. And that she was a lady
even her husband had very rarely attempted to
dispute.
There are many obvious ways by which a woman
can make a man understand that his acquaintance
is undesirable, but Mrs. Smith disdained them all.
She resolved to face the occasion and the stranger
with the confidence born of stern rectitude and
some little experience in the wily ways of the
opposite sex. Therefore, she waited with eyes
modestly gazing upon the sand, wondering what
he would say first, and hoping he would say it
politely. She considered that he should have lieen
up with her by that time, but the minutes Jagged
and she tried to feel glad at the thought that he
had probably turned back, and had no intention
of accosting her. Then she looked up and found
that he [had quietly passed her, and was slowly
vanishing in the distance, and with her gladness
hot upon her —as the old writer hath it—she
stared at the retreating figure till something
seemed to catch in her throat, and she flung her-
self against the sandhill and cried for very virtue
—I suppose.
She had been sobbing on her bishop-sleeves for
a little while, when she felt a touch—and a dis-
tinctly masculine touch at that—on her shoulder,
and immediately and furtively began to dry her
eyes. As this operation required some little time,
she murmured, “Please, go away !” in just that
tone which would compel him to remain, and
then, sitting bolt upright, raised her eyes and
looked directly, but shyly and virtuously, into the
eyes of —her husband.
* * #
It is easy for a guilty woman to look inno-
cent if sbe is guilty enough ; but for a carefully-
virtuous lady like Mrs. Smith, there is always
some room for uneasiness. So that when thus
unexpectedly she faced her husband, she felt
decidedly uncomfortable, and looked it. He ap-
peared to be as nearly angry as a gentlemanly
man with a flaxen beard can look, and dragged
her up to a standing position with that lack of
ceremony which in a bachelor is brutal—but in a
husband is merely domestic !
"So you thought be had come back, did you?”
he said, in that sneering tone so much in vogue
with the London Journal villain, who always
has “an indescribable something in his face.”
“I don’t understand you,” she replied, falling
back on woman’s most feeble weapon—her dignity.
“ I know you well enough to know that you do
understand me, and that is why you say yon
don't,'’ he said savagely. “I see 'it all,” he went
on melodramatically, “that fellow (pointing down
to the beach) has quarrelled with you, and you
have been crying because he has left you.”
She flushed up—really with anger, but appar-
ently with embarrassment ; then, seeing her
revenge, took it—being a woman.
“Alec.,” she said sweetly, “do yon think I
would cry because a man left me ? ”
“Yes,” he replied unwarily, “for that reason
alone.”
“ And yet,” said she, still gently, “ you have
never known me shed a tear when you have left
me, have you ? ”
It was not much to say, but the devil came out
of that slouching mouth and sat in the flaxen
beard as the man flinched, and lifted his hand to
reply with an impressive repartee after the manner
of his kind. But the hand came down again. It
was broad daylight, and there might be people
about. Otherwise lie would have struck her to
the ground. A dark man would have done it
and considered the consequence afterwards ; but
a flaxen beard is snaky and cautious, and rarely
dangerous in the light of day. Boarding-school
girls will do well to pin that little item in their
bonnets.
After provoking that little outburst, Mrs. Smith
turned to go ; but he brought her up sharp with a
round turn, and said :
“ Unless you are entirely graceless you will tell
me who that man is.”
“Unless yon were entirely degraded,” she
retorted, “you would not ask your wife such a
question.”
“Damn your fencing!” he exclaimed. “Do
yon deny that he is your lover ? ”
“I do deny it.”
“ And yet you were crying over him ? ”
“ Yes—l- -suppose T was.” ''
“ And you ask me to believe that he is not your
lover ? ” he said, incredulously.
Ido not ask you. I do not care what you
believe when you have to bo asked to believe ’it,”
she retorted.
His eyes had been looking anywhere but into
her face, and suddenly, with a great curse, ho
shouted—there is no other term so apt:
He is not your lover, eh ? Then, where is
your wedding-ring?” and held up her left hand
in derisive triumph.
lhat startled her as it would have startled any
wife in such a position. A rapid reflection showed
her her danger. The man in the distance; the
tear-traces on her cheeks ; her apparent equivoca-
tion, and that ringless third finger, all conspired
against her with such damning force that "’decree
wst seemed to be written all over the sand at her
feet, and she began nervously to wonder whether
she would be able to keep the matter out of the
papers. In fact, her predicament had so confused
her, that when her husband reiterated, “Where
is your wedding-ring?” she involuntarily replied.
I—-I always take it off when I am alone,” —
which was simply idiotic under the circumstances.
J hat remark was all the evidence he needed. It
was so utterly unbelievable and so apparently
wanton that the flaxen beard wagged viciously
once again, and the man had hard work to restrain
his right hand from doing that which it fairly
itched to do. But he merely said : “ You have
come to the end of your tether, my lady, so you
may as well tell me the fellow’s name.”
“Alec.,’she had come to pleading now, “ will
you believe that I don’t know that man from
Adam?”
“ But you were crying about him,” he said, with
stinging irony.
“Yes, but —oh, Alec., I can’t explain that—
only a woman would understand it —but”
“ Oh, don’t agitate yourself,” he interrupted,,
‘ I have no doubt if you have time enough you;
will be able to explain anything.”
“ Don’t condemn me so harshly, Alec.,” she was
getting more humble every minute. “If you will
follow that man and ask him, he will tell you that
I have never spoken one word to'him in my life.”
It seemed her last chance, but the case was
hopeless. Alec, simply said :
“I have no doubt lie will be quite willing to 1
support you,” and turned away to leave her.
“ Support you !” What a brutal douhle-entendre !'
She made another attempt, saying, with tears im
her voice :
“ Don’t go away like that, Alec.; let’s go home,,
and I will explain everything.”
“You have no home,” he said, mercilessly, and!
turned away again.
She crushed back a great sob, and hysterically
gasped :
“ Alec.! Alec.! you can’t mean that; you don't
mean it— say you don’t.”
“Why is your wedding-ring off ?”
“I meant no harm, Alec.”
“ Why were you crying over him ?”
“I was only thoughtless, Alec. Can’t, oh, can’t
you believe me ?”
“ What is his name?”
“I don’t know—on my honour, I don’t.”
For the third time he turned away, and for the
third time she followed him, and placing a
trembling hand on his shoulder, said: “Alec.,
forgive, and let me go home with you. Before
God, lam innocent.” And then the flaxen beard
fairly glowed in its wrath, and the right hand
felled her with a hard, cruel blow on the olieel-

Pure blood is a life-long delight. It is health—real good health and
strength—free from pimples, spots, sores and aches.
Have pure blood by taking Prazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally, and use
a really good modern soap—-Frazer’s Sulphur Soap—externally, and you
ensure a clear skin and a good complexion.
It is a mistake to suppose that a good skin or a clear complexion can be
secured by Soap' alone. It cannot. A pure Soap—Frazer’s Sulphur Soap

This must never be forgotten. If we can’t have the blood quite pure, then
we must get it as pure as we can,

business. Else if he be blotchy, pimply, or disfigured, other men fight shy
of dealing with him. Let the man take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally
and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.
A woman needs a good complexion else her happiness is decreased, and
her charm to the other sex much lessened. Let the woman take Frazer’s
Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.
A child for its health’s sake needs a rosy skin, free from eruptive
blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Let
the child take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur
Soap externally.
Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets used internally ensures good blood—pure blood
that holds disease at bay and gives health.
Frazer’s Sulphur Soap renders the skin soft, supple and smooth, neither
drying the oils of the skin, nor shrivelling the nails, nor splitting the hairs.
It is a milled soap, contains extra balm, and is free from excess of alkali or
fat. It is simple and truly the best of all Soaps, and contains Oil of
Eucalyptus.

Ye Chant of Ye Bedlamite.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The bishop of Exeter has lately been giving religious
instruction to the inmates of a lunatic asylum. Hesa.vs
he does not think that lunacy prevents a man grasping
religious truths.
You may be cracked and crazy (said the Bishop
t’other day),
You may believe yourself a goat and try to feed
on bay,
You may believe yourself a ben and do your best
to lay,
And yet your brain may comprehend the whole
the Prophets say.
You may in fitful frenzy’s fire have kissed your
ma-in-law,
You may believe a woman’s tongue can sleep
within her jaw,
You may believe an M.L.A. could pass the whisky
by.
And still your mind may drink the Trewth that
comforts when you die.
You may believe yourself a hog and start to raise
a sty,
Or, like Bavaria’s Ludwig, build yourself a nest
... on high ;
You may believe the modern dude has brains
within his head,
Yet see the mystic drift of all the ancient Hebrews
said.
You may believe yourself a sage and think you
often saw
An honest man in wig and gown and practising
the law;
You may believe the cablegramuier never tells a
lie,
Yet you may grasp Salvation’s scheme —and see
the reason why.
You may be the veriest essence of a sublimated
ass,
Believe yourself a toy-balloon and fill yourself
with gas,
Believe no parson eyes the screw—whene’er he gets
“a call,”
Yet you may weigh the Scriptures well and under-
stand them all.
You may believe you’re made of lard and fear the
summer sun,
Believe yourself the princely heir of a certain
Gracious One;
You may believe the good old press is straight and
staunch and true,
And yet peruse the Blessed Book—and compre-
hend it, too.
You oft may need a padded cell and eke a jacket
strait,
You oft may need a little ice to cool your heated
pate,
You oft may rend the midnight air with many a
maniac yell,
And yet imbibe the precious news the Bishop has
to tell.
So, hear the gladsome tidings now—Ye Bed-
lamites—with joy;
Let holy hymns and saintly psalms your lucid
hours employ.
The Bishop says—the dogmas dark that puzzle all
the sane
May yet be comprehended—when there's water on
the brain.

The Primate of Ireland takes his holy place
on the platform at anti-Hoine Rule meetings at
Belfast, as an outward visible sign that God dis-
approves of Gladstone’s policy.
The editor of D.D. Gazette (Toowoomba,

In England the other day a law-case had
to be postponed on account of the non-appearance
of an essential witness, who, ere being served with
a subpoena, had arranged to get married at that
very hour. The Judge held the excuse to be valid.

Twenty-six thousand aliens, mostly Russian
and Polish, swarmed into England during the
month of May. 22,300 of them were supposed to
be on their way to America, and the rest, being
entirely stone-broke, had come to stay. It is the
everlasting influx of these poor drudges, who
seldom eat or sleep, never wash themselves, and
have no ambition but to exist on starvation wages,
that mocks at ihs eight-hours’ agitation in our
dear old mother-country.
The will of William Astor, ’Murkan money-
bags, went out of its way to mention that testator’s
brother Henry was to get nothing from the estate.
Henry, long years ago, horrified his bloated family
by marrying the daughter of an impecunious
farmer for love. His father cut him off with a
solemn curse, and his miserable brother Bill signi-
fied the enduring quality of Astor snobbery in the
manner aforesaid. Henry seems to have made a
pile for himself all the same. He occupies the big
house in a village called Astorville, built and
owned by himself, and is believed to be the only
happy member of all bis dollar-damned clan.
In the Maorilantl courts they are getting
very tired of that eternal small debt case, in which
the book-canvasser sues the subscriber for non-
payment of the bill for a hunk of literature.
Maoriland rose in revolt against the bound-book
man two years ago, and every day since then, in
almost every court in the country, a cold, delibe-
rate, nasal person, with lank, black hair, has
climbed into the witness-box and made this state-
ment : “I canvassed the defendant an’gave him
an idea of the scope of the work, when he decided
to become a subscriber, an' signed the agreement
which I now prq/oisc.” Then tiie defendant,
who is generally hot and excited, with grass-
seeds in Ids hair, gets into the box in his turn,
and unburdens himself thus: “1 signed the list
as a patron t" rekkymend the work, and I put my
name and address on a blank sheet of paper for
the. canvasser to call again, but f never signed any
other dokyinent." They always tell the same
story, both of them, and when they are through
the Court gives judgment for the plaintiff with
costs ; and then the case of another excited defen-
dant is called, and I lie canvasser telh the same
story over again with the same invariable ending
—l* he decided to become a subscriber, an’signed
the agreement which T now pro.Vww®.”
