The Red Page
Clnquainanity
Thousands of cinquains, or worse, have
poured in upon this page. It looks so easy
to do ! Five little lines that needn’t even
rime! Yet, what the majority of cinquain-
ists forgot, those five little lines must hold
poetry, or humor, or emotion, or thought.
The cinquain must be packed tight: into
that tiny space so much must be crammed!
The evil influence of the American example
quoted on this page permeates this competi-
tion. Hundreds of cinquains are merely
echoes of that poor and uninspiriting effort.
Yet here and there, as will be seen from the
examples quoted, that commonplace idea of
flowers fading, of leaves falling, of night
coming, is touched with fantasy or expressed
with felicity.
The question of rime has been raised by
several competitors; and a number of cin-
quains possess that added grace. Rime
should certainly be allowed in the cinquain,
though, as will be seen, some of the finest
cinquains submitted do not need the help of
rime. Thomas V. Tierney offers us a varia-
tion of the form, which he terms the cin-
quainette, though the name cinquade would
be more appropriate. It consists of three
cinquains, and contains five rimes, each line
of the second and third verses riming with
the corresponding line of the first verse. His
example:—
THE PARTING.
Dearest,
The time draws nigh
When I must join toy mates;
Beside the dock the transport stands,
Adieu!
Clearest —
Its note on high—
The bugle rings; who waits
When all his help that call demands?
Ah, who?
Nearest
My heart shall lie
Your image, and the Pates
May bring- me safe, from distant lands,
To you.
A number of competitors make a long poem
with each stanza a cinquain. “Bellyband,”
M.B. and “Elizabeth 65” prove that the
five-line stanza has possibilities, though none
quite merits quotation. R.G.S. offers a
pleasant cinquain-twin :
THE MOTHER.
To-night,
The wind outside,
Shrieks through the timorous trees
Of anguished souls, with sobbing breath,
Who die.
But yet,
This firelit room
With loved familiar things,
Speaks to my heart of peace—and you
With God.
Naturally, the cinquain lends itself to humor.
The sting in the tail is so often ironic : the
ballet-dancer, pirouetting, ludicrously falls.
Hebe is an assortment of canned cinquain
humor: —-

This page specified that cinquains had to
be in iambic metre, though allowing slight
irregularities when they improved the mean-
ing. But a number of cinquainists deliber-
ately disregarded this advice, and the excel-
lent cinquains of Millie Burrows and L. FoU
are cast out; as also for other technical
faults are those of R.G.S. and Henry Tate.
Though “Eadith Walker” breaks all the
metric rules, the absurdity of her cinquain is
sufficient excuse for quotation : —•

Which means loss of temper—
For no one knows where the matches
Are kept.

The following einquains are selected for
their daintiness, their truth, their power to
evoke emotion, even for their apt and neat
compression of a common-place thought, or
the age-old human touch. A personal pref-
erence is perhaps the chief criterion of this
page’s judgment: the cinquain is so delicate
a thing, an ephemeron poised in its moment
and caught ere it disappears, that it must
make its appeal instantaneously or not at
all. i

The French Revolution
Timely, is the translation of the brilliant
and authoritative National History of
France, written by a group of the greatest
French historians under the general editor-
ship of Fr. Funck-Brentano, and now pub-
lished in six volumes by Heinemann, and
sold, in complete sets only, by Angus and
Robertson, Sydney. Each of these volumes
is about 600 pages in length, and the periods
covered are: the Middle Ages, the Renais-
sance, the Great Century, the 18th Century,
the Revolution and the Consulate and the
Empire. So far, however, only three
volumes hk-e been published. The set costs
£3 out here. _ '
Especially interesting is the volume by
Louis Madelin, upon The French Revolu-
tion, since from this brilliant study of the
greatest drama in history we gain a stand-
point of comparison of the similar drama
now happening in the Republic of Russia.
It is at least probable that the two revolu-
tions will run approximately the same
course; and the student of history may
already, with the help of this book, discern
points at which the later drama plagiarises
the former. Louis XVI., like the Czar
supposed to be a despot, was really the chief
slave of a system which he might dis-
approve of but could not modify. The more
complete the French Revolution became the
more evident were the dissatisfactions it
evoked; and already we see that tendency
in troubled Russia. The Russian soldier’s
revolt against his officer is but a reminiscence
of the destruction of all army discipline in
France in 1790: at Nancy three regi-
ments threw their officers into prison. And
the foolish hesitation of Hindenburg to
attack Russia in her first agonies of revolu-
tion is but a repetition of the craftily wait-
ing attitude of Europe while ITrance worked
out her salvation. The amiable delusion of
France’s enemies was that France was about
to disappear as a factor in the European
problem. Like Russia she was to b§ allowed
to stew in her own juice—and the chief in-
gredient of that juice was named Napoleon!
So far history has not divulged the name
of Russia’s Napoleon—that military genius
who will appear to weld this distracted
anarchy into a conquering power; but
Russia' has a habit of producing military
geniuses. But even a revolutionary army,
in which the t volunteers elected their own
commanding officers, as the French army
did, was able to beat the Prussian. And
surely we are entitled to look for the ulti-
mate advent in Russia of “the superior man,
above all his contemporaries, and perhaps
above his century,” as Katherine 11. of
Russia wrote in 1794, predicting Napoleon.
The time will come in Russia, as it came
in France, when Russia must once again be
governed by a single ruler. “Revolutions
always end with the sword.” Though after
the sword there may be the Rock. And
after the Rock the stable Republic.
&
During the last 20 years an avalanche of
documentary testimony has overwhelmed
the historians of France ; and thus the time
is ready for a re-writing of the drama of
the Revolution. And this Louis Madelin
has brilliantly and dramatically done. The
author considers that the Revolution was
not against despotism but against inequality :
its nature was far more social than political.
The majority of. the nation dreaded revolu-
tion. “Once rid of the feudal rights and the
crushing weight of the taxes, a good three-
quarters of them would have been content.”
The author, however, gives full weight to
the part played by the bandits, the criminal
and I.W.W. element of the Paris of those
days. These battened on revolutions; they
had nothing to lose. “And the whole coun-
try was in the grip of a sort of national
hysteria, which historians will never be able
to explain.” The taking of the Bastille, a
bogey fortress, was due to the mere aimless
longing of the mob for something to destroy.
Madelin calls it a contemptible business.
The storm began to growl; and, swept on
by forces that they could not control, leaders
momentarily emerged, flew for a mad instant
before the wind, and fell. Of these remark-
able, figures the author gives vivid portraits.
Madame Roland “was one of the human ele-
ments in the Revolutionary drama: she in-
spired it, led it, diverted its course, till she
herself. Jay crushed beneath its ruins She
was womanly to her fingertips, fanciful, pas-
sionate, exaggerated. . . . Her view was always
obscured by her affections or her dislikes.”
In the editor’s eyes Danton towered high
above them all. “He was horribly sincere;
everything came from the depths of his
heart—pity, rage, love, ferocity. Rancor
and calculation were alike foreign to him.
He had a great brain and a warm heart.
.... He was a volcano, but above the hor-
rible-flood of lava played the purest flame.”
He was a greater man than Robespierre.
There, too, was Marat, violent to the verge
of insanity, quarrelsome, cynical, cunning,
a Mediterranean half-breed, deliberately sor-
did and evil-smelling, with black locks escap-
ing from the bandana handkerchief soaked
with vinegar, worn to alleviate his almost
unendurable headaches —the People’s Friend.
Robespierre, who sent Danton to the guil-
lotine, and soon followed him, was a “vir-
tuous” man, upright, chaste, moral, dreading
money, and most of all dreading women. “He
was to pursue them always with a special
hatred; he it was who did most to bring
Mme. Roland to the scaffold Even his
own sister Charlotte was coldly thrust out
of his existence. And, hating women as he
did, he despised anyone who loved them.
For the first time in history sentimental and
laughter-loving France was ruled by a sworn
enemy of women and of laughter.” A wow-
ser we would have called him. An elegant
youth, with of course the famous light green
eyes behind blue spectacles, the perfection of
neatness, clean-shaved, his hair curled and
powdered, this sans-culotte thought too much
of his appearance to sacrifice his silk
breeches. He guillotined all the friends of
his childhood and his youth. His three dog-
mas were: the support of virtue by terror,
the existence of the Supreme Being, and the
absolute sanctity of property. The trouble
about cutting off people’s heads in order to
make them good is that you can never cut
off quite enough. As Robespierre’s batches
grew bigger and bigger each day, the number
of those who knew their heads were des-
tined for to-morrow’s basket proportionally
increased. At last there were so many
under suspicion that desperation drove them
to consider the possibility, of “shortening”
Robespierre himself. If they failed the re-
sult would only be the same to themselves.
So, as the author dramatically describes,
they got him.
Another interesting figure is that creature
of beauty and grace, Therezia Cabarrus,
formerly a marquise, then the wife of Citi-
zen Tallien, ultimately to become Princesse
de Chimay. She was beautiful and seduc-
tive beyond all expression. After the reign
of Robespierre the woman hater, it seems to
Madelin right that the new regime should find
its incarnation in this fascinating woman of
easy morals, generally believed to be common
property.
Under the Directory it was Therezia Tal-
lien who set the fashions. “All through four
years of the blackest misery her famous red
coach passed up and down, the only one in
Paris that escaped insult. She bestowed
royal alms upon the populace: she never
shut herself up in the Luxembourg: she
showed herself half-naked in the public places*
of the city.” She was worthy to queen a
society when the women wore hardly any
clothes at all —the celebrated sans-cliemises,
or the sauvage costume, the arms and bosom
bare, with a gauze skirt and flesh-colored
drawers beneath it. It was this society that
passed the law which gave authority to hus-
band or wife to divorce on the ground of
absence for six months, no exception being
made in the case of soldiers absent on active
service. Thus a soldier might come home
from Italy, covered with glory, and find a
new husband installed in his home.
For the greatest personality of all France
was waiting, the artisans soured by false
hopes* the middle-class grown rich who
wanted to be safe, the peasants who wanted
the revolution consolidated: a personal ruler
was required to ensure stability. The coun-
try was weary. Not even victories roused
it now. There was a general indolence, a
general indifference.
J*
So the tremendous drama rushed to its
climax. “To the very last the French Revo-
lution was driven forward by a kind of
Fatum. Bonaparte no more knew what he
was going to do on the 19th, Brumaire than
the men who took the Bastille on the morn-
ing of July 14, the deputies who upset the
throne, or those who set up the revolt.” It
was Lucien Bonaparte who made his brother
supreme—though history must give equal
credit to Napoleon’s pimples. In his frenzy
of impatience he had torn the pimples, with
winch his face was covered, with his finger-
nails. “The blood gave color to the story that
the deputies had attacked and wounded him
‘with daggers’: the troops were infuriated by
the thought that these lawyers had dared to
lift their hands against the victor of Areola.”
Napoleon’s bleeding pimples and Lucien Bona-
part’s melodramatic acting convinced the
soldiers; and the drums began to beat the
march that would lead him to the throne.
•
The Ascanian, published at sea, is another
troopship magazine. After an editorial it
begins well with Church News, and with
humor and verse, and even an Answers to
Correspondents column and an Art Supple-
ment, it no doubt contributed to the amuse-
ment of those on board. Most of the writers,
as usual, are bards —and pretty bad bards.
Another interesting war-publication is
The Harcfield Park Boomerang, issued
monthly by the patients of No. 1 Australian
Army Hospital, Harefield Park, Middlesex,
England, where many wounded and sick
Billjims are keeping up their spirits in exile.
A contributor, writing from a sick-bed, ap-
peals to Bulletin artists to send them
drawings for this magazine. It is a cheery
little rag. genuinely Australian in sentiment
and humor. Its most .popular illustration
is doubtless a photograph of a dairy herd in
distant N. S. Wales. There, is a list or
Anzac graves, too, 29 Anzacs in the old
parish churchyard of Harefield, and a Head-
stone fund, for which the pathetic appeal is
made to provide those lonely dead with
marble memorials.

(adjustable).
WAY of getting rid of these pests is by means
of a SUCCESS SPRAYER, as illustrated.
THE SUCCESS SPRAYER, price 25/-, is a
handy PUMP for use in the garden, vineyard, oi’chard
or poultry-house. The working parts are of brass'
and the bucket foot-rest is made of malleable iron.
NOTHING COULD BE SIMPLER OR MORE
DURABLE THAN THIS PUMP : It has a large
air-chamber space, and as it is double-acting an
absolutely continuous stream is thrown. Each
SUCCESS SPRAYER is furnished with a Bor-
deaux Nozzle, which throws a strong stream, fine or
double spray (adjustable). The Sprayer is sold
with three feet of hose, but extra hose may be
obtained at ad. per foot.
ROGERS’ ARSENATE OF LEAD
A quick and safe method of ridding vegetable
growth of insect pests is to use a spray composed
of ROGERS’ ARSENATE OF LEAD. If this
is applied by means of a SUCCESS SPRAYER
the results will be eminently, satisfactory.

Spring Sunshine.
I do not want to be “a brain” to-day, ‘‘a
soul,” nor any fine progressive thing.
I only want a warm slope of the earth
To smell the sun-hot herbs and suck their
worth,
To see the midges in their circling play, and
know that there is Summer following
Spring.
I do not want a speech on Woman’s Rights,
the rhetoric of labored feminist,
My duty shown me in a stuffy hall,
With rows of benches gaping at a wall.
I want free blue-air morns and star-white
nights. Not to be reasoned with, but
only kist!
I don’t want economics proved to me, nor
matriarchy and its missioning.
I want to put my mouth against a flower
And drink of folly for a jesting hour
Abubble like the young sap in the tree, in
the compelling, ruthless lust of Spring.
Nature is cruel —and she always was! If I
drink deep to-day, to-morrow’s thirst
Shall send me, parch-mouthed, to another
stream.
To-day I seek no reason in a dream —-
A truer dream than reason my heart has.
Come, Phoebus, from the sky and do
your worst!

Motherhood: The First Phase.
When whirled the shining dust of stars
unborn—
A little spinning eddy ’twixt the palms
Of the least angel of creativeness —
A beauty brooding in the mind of God
Beat like a heart. Pleasure and painfulness
Fluttered together, and a sanctity
Pain-pointed, exquisite and glittering,
Was set about them as a crown of thorns.
And silver were those thorns, and diamond
tears
Were slipp’d amid them, and the drops of
blood
Were rubies, poignant, rich with agony.
A wreath of precious sorrow holding joy
So stirr’d the motherhood that was to be,
Conceived within the tenderness of God.
A pregnant silence held the primal world.
A silence cramm’d with growth and the
uncurl
Of frond, and the out-thrust of petal-lip.
The overwhelming forest, midnight wombed
Thickened with rope on rope of sappy life,
Inlacing, till its dome of blossom broke
Sun hungry to the sum a hundred feet
Above the fecund ferment at the roots.
The tepid river, darkened at midday,
Lisped through the labyrinth of mighty ferns,
And not a gnat dance<J on the water floor.
Only the leaping pour of the cascade.
Born boiling from the lips of uncooled rock,
Where yawning bloody-throated in the steam
Gnat flower-gullets gaped from mottled
leaves,
Made clamor in the dumb, growth-burdened
world.
The pregnant seed-bulb swelled, and pod, and
sac,
And honey-headed stamen did their part,
A ceaseless, silent stir of parenthood.
But unemotioned was the blending act,
And painless the fertility, and buds
Clove mindless to a mindless mother-stem.

My pulse is cold ; my heart gives not a thrill
To see her as she lies.
The cover, twisted by her loose-flung arm,
Showing her snowy neck, her bosom warm,
Heaving with sleepy sighs.
Her full, red lips just quiver with her
breath ;
Her lashes shade her cheek ;
Rut recently my heart had been a-fire
With the strong passion of my heart’s desire
That now is grown so weak !
To touch her hand ; to, trembling, let my lips
Meet hers that said she loved,
Set blood a-stir with passion wild and warm.
But now the full possession of her charm
Leaves me unstirred, unmoved.
And yet I love her —not as once I did ;
But, in the cold control
Of all my senses, one warm thought holds -
sway ;
She gave herself to me. . . .and so I stay,
For that gift bought my soul.

Yet all neglected I must pine—
You don’t break mine !
’Tis whispered that your wondrous eyes
Win men from home and sacred ties.
Make me a victim, sweet, I pray—•
Win me away.
With but a single hair you lead
A Samson? Is it so indeed?
Then leave me not to fret and chafe,

Stilettoed by your steel-grey eye.
Ah, callous wretch ! My breast is bared f

WILHELM.
Wilhelm of Prussia takes the baleful lime-
light of the world's most tragic scene. Any-
body who has nursed the smallest doubt as
to the real authorship of the tempest of
blood that is desolating Europe can now
throw that doubt into the rubbish-tip and
readjust his views in the light of the
most recent revelations. It has, of
course, been particularly hard in Britain
and America, and still harder in countries
like our own, to see Prussian intrigue in
proper focus. The acts of king, president
and governor are in the freer lands really
the acts of the nation ; and we have got so
far away from the idea of personal govern-
ment that it was for long impossible to con-
ceive of the Kaiser as other than the mouth-
piece of a people, or at worst of a powerful
faction. The talk about his personality
was brushed aside. We had heard the >■> ne
sort of talk about Edwaku VII. of England ;
but we knew that the alleged deeds of
Edward were the deeds of his Ministers, and
that the scope and influence of the monarchy
were more limited than even the bare forms
of the British Constitution would suggest.
The thing that was so hard to realise about
Germany was that, while making a big show
in arts and sciences, while electing Socialist
representatives to her Parliaments and ex-
tending the most modern of manufacturing
systems and pushing her commerce in the
most modern way, the country was still gov-
erned by the methods of the Middle Ages
and that a king was still a king for both
good and evil. Despite aeroplanes and
radium and Marx and the universal preva-
lence of the German band, Wilhelm 11. was.
at the outset of the war, as unshackled for
intrigue, aggression and reform as Edward
111. of England; and a heap more so than
Charles 1., whose minor acts of despotism
brought about a revolution. And Wilhelm
used the powers that were his to the full:
and used them in a manner that no publicist
in Europe would have deemed possible half
a century before. It is never a wise thing
to under-estimate an enemy; and Wilhelm
has been seriously under-estimated. The man
who could take up such a part as his and
play his role with such astonishing courage
find skill is a very big man. That he is m
our judgment a very bad man does not take
away from that fact. His prosing and
posing, his painted face, his theatrical pos-
turing and all the rest are things that lie
had in common with a lot of the world-
changers of the past; and if he had been in
the habit of standing on his head to eat
his meals it could not filter tin' simple con-
clusion from the general trend of his policy
that during his whole reign he has been by
far the largest force in European polities,
•and that he made himself that force at a
time when democracy seemed to have gripped
personal monarchy by the throat. Alex-
ander rose with the natural rise of the
Macedonian State at a time when all other
national powers were crumbling; Julius
Cjesar was the outcome of the evolution
find extension of the Roman Republic;
Napoleon was thrown up by the fiery surge
of the French Revolution. Wiliielm alone
of all the chief world-disturbers gained his
grim eminence in defiance of and in opposi-
tion to the whole trend of the times and
the whole thought and feeling of the modern
world. To under-estimate a man like that
is as bad a blunder as to mistake the feel-
ings and intentions of a tiger because he
happens to have strolled into a cabbage-
garden.
But the Kaiser’s bigness in one regard
must not be allowed to interfere with our
view of his pettiness in another. The world’s
mighty disturbers of the past have a place
not only in history but also in the philosophy
of human progress. Alexander, mad with
ambition and plain booze, had yet a purpose
as finely ethical as that of a religious re-
former. He conceived the notion of break-
ing the menace of Asia forever by carrying
into that continent something of what was
finest and most stable in Greek thought and
piactice; and his lightning conquests of 11
years did, in fact, alter the whole shape of
things for the half-dozen centuries that fol-
lowed. Julius (Aesar appears, wdien pro-
perly weighed, to have struck a balance of
iron system and free democracy, which was
the top note in political thinking in his day,
and might, if pursued by his successors, have
done more for the moral uplift of humanity
than all the religious systems. Napoleon,
with vaguer ideals and an occasional lapse
from idealism altogether, had also a purpose
of wide human kindness which by making
France supreme in world-empire would have
also made French thought supreme, to the
raising up of every serf and slave to the
dignity of manhood. In such a succession
Wilhelm looks a poor thing. German civil-
isation had no claims over those of the sur-
rounding nations that could at all correspond
to the thing which Alexander took to Asia.
German system was linked to no dream of
universal citizenship justifying the extension
of power such as Caesar imagined. German
lultur had none of the fine elements of the
French thought of liberty which followed
Napoleon’s banners. Reared in a narrow
dynastic nursery, and thinking of the world
and its States in terms of personal owner-
ship, the Kaiser had no bigger purpose than
to grab something large and rich for himself
and the race over which he directly ruled.
A great ethical conception might conceivably
be worth the outpouring of rivers of blood
and the endless disturbance of lands and
peoples; but the Kaiser’s whole mind was
bent on a vast raid of plunder, which differed
only in magnitude from the wars waged by
the barbarous barons and kinglets of the
Middle Ages. He would, by using any means
and in defiance of every law. smash France
and bring England to her knees, not with
any idea of carrying ultimately something
better and finer to those nations in return
for their immediate suffering, but merely that
Germany might be riclrer and his own power
extended. While he was capable of in some
degree measuring democratic forces and
estimating currents of feeling outside his
own system, he yet thought of Russia as
the private park of his weakling acquaint-
ance •‘Nikky" and even of England as a
disorderly workshop belonging to his relative
George, while France was a mere field run
by co-operative farmers whose title to the
ground was bad ever since the first Revolu-
tion. International law was a doubtful
plaything of Hague Conventions and inter-
national honor a mild sentiment which a
howitzer could blow away. All things were
to the strong; and strength alone was law
at the last. It was exactly the guiding prin-
ciple of brigand gentlemen who rode abroad
dressed like kitchen stoves in the Middle
Ages. Yet it was a strong man who could
take such a view in defiance of all the liberal
thought of the age and with the memories
of kings who had lost their heads at the
hands of democracy making a modern blood-
trail across the page of history. Wilhelm
measured himself against those headless
weaklings and took the chances.
* * ♦ »
But it was the essential clarity of the
Kaiser’s thinking that very nearly scored a
success greater than that of any Alexander
or (Aesar. The building up of force and
the training of the German people to ideal-
ise force was not a particularly difficult busi-
ness in the light of previous Prussian suc-
cesses ; and the building of ships and guns
by private firms fostered the idea among the
manufacturing and industrial classes that
war might be good and profitable business.
But it was not in this direction that Wil-
helm’s real successes were won. It w 7 as in
his estimate of mankind and its advances.
England, France, the TJ.S.A. and a number
of other countries built their ideas of human
progress on the works of their best authors
and thinkers; Wilhelm built his on the
sure knowledge that an enormous chasm
divided the thinker from the great mass of
the people. He knew that to a very large
extent force ruled the world —whether it was
the force in the hip-pocket of an armed
civilian or the boots of the policeman on his
beat. He was sure that the world would
still understand an empire of force better
than anything else. Smaller men with bigger
hearts would have hesitated about allying
themselves with the crude old things which
all men of light and learning condemned.
Wilhelm had no such hesitation. The bed-
rock savage w r as still the dominant factor in
human nature, and fear was still the true
ally of the conqueror. But a show must be
made nf things, and the Prussian desperado
knew' how to keep up that show' better thiiu
most men His pretended intei national
fSdsSps' were only half believed .n : hut
his religious zeal and his encou agemei t ot
apparently progressive movements within
his own empire were taken at face va
Gott was still with him even when he was
scheming with "Nikky” for tke assassina-
tion of England and proposing to walk
roughshod over all the rights of Denmark
The long years of strenuous self-repression
and carefully-rehearsed theatncalism indi-
cate the man of intense purpose. He was
playing for world-empire, and lie brought his
weapons to a fine edge. Those weapons were
the German people and as many people ot
other nations as could be impressed with the
idea that he was something other than lie
was. His spv system and methods of rninoi
intrigue were marvellously successful; ana
the wav in which these were linked up with
commerce and won a smiling recognition
from the importer of every country revea a
genius for detail in the handling of the vast
plot. Other Germans did much; but there
seems no reason to doubt that the controlling
mind was in every instance the Kaiser s.
Force was the master-key and guile the oil
to make it turn in the world’s rusted lock
Then the unexpected occurred. Ihe war
began, and a single hole was knocked in the
vast system that Wilhelm believed to be
perfect. France stood up and fought .as no
nation of men had ever fought in all lustoij.
The world believed in force in its inmost
heart—perhaps, as the Kaiser had all along
assumed, it believed in nothing else. But the
world saw force matched with torce; anti
the smaller-seeming power linked with all of
noble and fair that it had ever dreamed.
Wilhelm reeled back from that first blow
and never wholly recovered. But it was not
the end, nor is the end yet in sight. Through
the cannon smoke and the world-murdei the
man who, of deliberate purpose, elected to be
the arch-traitor of civilisation still looms
tremendous. To under-estimate him now is
as dangerous as it was four years ago. On d-
isation is fighting a Prussian system, ant
more. It is fighting a man who is capable,
as your large man alw T ays is, of snatching
victory from the dregs of defeat. II index-
burg and Michaelis, Tirpitz and Holl-
weg count for something; but the hand
that holds the sword is that of the Kaiser
himself. There is no safety for the nations
and the children of the nations while such a
man lives. The thing that he has done can
be repeated. In its advance the world —that
fine part of the world that counts, but a few
thousands, and does all the sincere thinking
—must leave the boots of a countless host
far behind it; and it must always be open to
a man without half the Kaiser s daring to
follow the example he has set and organise
the laggards for an attack on the rear of the
marching column of mind. There is the
supreme danger for all the future from
which only a hangman’s rope well applied
can save humanity.
CAN LABOR FIND ITS ENEMY?
Years ago workers in England and some
other countries combined as trades unionists
, i i * n
and put up a scattered but determined light
. 1 , m, , h „
for tuppence a day. The tuppence was the
• *.
main consideration, as it stood directly and
unmistakably for the workers’ breakfast-
a minor luxury which had for long been
practically denied to them. When, however,
the fight for better wages and conditions had
continued in a spluttering and uncertain
fashion for some time, theorists got busy
about the meaning of the movement, and it
was understood that Labor was fighting
Capital. Just what Capital was like and
what sort of force he had behind him was a
matter about which nobody was very clear,
The owner of the works or the boss of the
mine was known; but it was understood
that he was merely one of the lieutenants ot
Capital, and the elusive animal itself on
which Labor made war was never dis-
covered. It was evident that the banks
existed by lavor ot Capital and that cash
waUed him about in splendor on every side;
but never even in the thickest of the battle
as . a . tthmpse caught of his countenance.
Statisticians produced endless columns ot
figures professing to explain him ; but the
figures only deepened the mystery, lo the
actual fighter in the Labor ranks Capital
appeared as something in a belltopper from
whom by truculence or guile an infinite mini-
her of tuppences per day could be drawn
And while things remained in this doubtful
condition it was understood that both Capi-
tal and Labor had come to this country and
were continuing their old-world fight across
the new continent. In the full Australian
sunshine and the wide, open spaces it seemed
inevitable that Capital would have to dis-
cover himself and show his face plainly in
the battle-in fact, there was a great and
growing hope that Labor might actually cor-
ner him, get him down and take away all
the tuppences he had in his bulging pockets.
But the fight went on and the central figure
round which it raged was still only a name.
Politicians, intoxicated with their own
wordy outpourings, scanned the horizon
and declared that thev saw Capital
flying away. That the great bird in bell-
topper and frock coat should spread its
wings and depart, leaving Labor without the
desirable tuppence of its latest demand.
seemed to them the last calamity that could
overtake the worker; but the evidences of
actual and visible cash indicated that in
spite of many alleged flights Capital was
with us still, though it contrived to hide its
face and inner purpose as cleverly as ever,
* * * *
The involved and uncertain fight wobbled
on. Labor became a political force; the
people were told to become class-conscious
and get the enemy under their feet. They
became class-conscious: the toilers reduced
the quantity and quality of the thing they
exchanged for their bread-and-butter: Capi-
tal appeared to be getting it in the neck
through countless strikes. So hard was
the fight and so bitter the spirit in which it
was urged that at last the foremost ranks of
Labor broke turough the very centre of the
enemy s formation and came face to face
with the arch-monster himself—Capital,
arrayed not in belltopper and spats, but
wearing plain bowyangs and looking as if
ho needed more dinner! There and
then the old fight should have come
to an end; but the nature of the
warfare was such that most of the com
batants were too blind with anger to pro-
perly understand the position. Those in the
rear ranks did not see and refused to believe
until they had seen; and only a few 0 f
those who were right up against the central
danger itself would admit the truth of their
own vision. So the fight goes on; and
Capital—the thing that yielded and would
continue to yield tuppences—is bein''
hacked to pieces. In other words, Labor
smashing Labor takes away the only chance
ir has to improve its own position. Capital
can only exist while Labor is prepared to
create it; and the worst blow ever struck
at unionism is the one which aims at
destroying the only basis on which unionism
can carry on.
* * * *
The present strike, which has gripped
X. S. Wales by the throat and flopped over
into other States to extend inconvenience
and public suffering to its utmost limits, has
made these things clear. The Railway
workers strike, and another union in a spirit
of loud, brotherly sympathy declares the
food of the first strikers black. Another
union and another rallies to the battle-call,
each holding up out of sheer goodwill some-
thing without which the others cannot live.
The machinery rusts, the organisation of
industry breaks up in a way that renders
its repair difficult, insults are hurled about
and angry declamations fill the air; and the
effect of the whole foolish suffering on the
part of the workers is merely to render their
own chance of making a living in the future
more precarious. Getting back to the
statisticians who tried long ago to explain
the nature of Capital by columns of figures,
the real nature of a general strike is seen
sharply enough defined to warn Labor off a
track like that. The whole Capital of new
countries such as Australia is re-made every
five years. Cut out plain toil from a few
weeks of one of those years and add to that
loss the continued disorganisation which
must follow, and it is pretty evident that
Capital’s power to pay out the additional
tuppence whenever demanded is much les-
sened. The fruit of five years’ toil is all
we possess; and by reducing our joint pos-
session even 5 per cent. Labor’s position
must be seriously shaken. There is only
one way in which Capital can be made to
unload from bulging pockets all that Labor
may desire or demand. That way is by
keeping those pockets full to overflowing
with systematic toil. Rut Labor clings still
to the childish fancy that it can draw wages
from some imaginary treasury where a fat
man has stored up wealth and hidden it out
of sight. It is a destroying belief. Labor
holds Capital in the activity of its own
strong hands; and if the hands cease to be
active all the processions and banner-
wavings in the world won't create wealth
out of which wages can be paid.
CHINESE HABITS AND BRITISH
CUSTOMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The houseboat chained to the canal-bank did
not attract my attention particularly. I sat
eating my pocket-tiffin and joyfully watch-
ing the endless stream of traffic being carried
with wind, tide and oar towards Soochow in
the fond illusion that I had left western
civilisation behind me, when a well-groomed
head of fair hair was thrust out of a port-
hole. and I was greeted in the dear, familiar
accents of Australia. I climbed down, in
response to a pressing invitation. He was a
Victorian, and was very lonely out there.
He welcomed me gladly. He formed the
northern barrier of the Chinese Imperial
Maritime Customs. He had just passed
through a trying time. Waves of revolution
had passed to and fro over his head, and the
rebel and republican leaders had both
stretched out hands for the eashbox he held
in trust; but he had sat tight and refused
to pay out to either party until constitu-
tional authority had been re-established;
and, although the odds had been all against
him. no attempt had been made to force the
till.
Just below him was the likiu station, rep-
resentative of that infamous institution
which hangs like a deadly parasite to the
sturdy growth of Chinese trade. It is the
State Frights of China. It stands on the
borders of every district, and holds a pistol
to the head of the merchant, making him dis-
gorge Customs dues which vary according to
the greed and audacity of the local adminis-
trator. Some idea of the quality of this
peculiarly Chinese institution can be gauged
from revenue figures published some dozen
years ago. Out of 15 million taels collected
as likin in one year only one million reached
Peking. A parcel of tea at the end of u s
vicissitudes has been known to pay in taxes
40 times the legal amount. Of the total
native collection of revenue in the provinces
it is estimated that only 30 per cent, to la
per cent, reaches the Imperial Treasury
The possible revenue from land, customs,
salt and tribute under present conditions has
been placed at 400 millions taels. Twenty -
fivo millions actually reach the capital!
Contrast this with the record of the im-
perial Maritime Customs. Hired in the up
rightness of a single British official lin
time of internal weakness and disorder, when
the Government was unable to collect 1
taxes itself, he refused to allow his con
trymen to follow the example of the trader
of other nations and smuggle their goods 1
with impunity), and carried on b.v the gem •
of Sir Robert Hart, it stands a monumei
to British incorruptibility and an examP
to the Chinese of the material and ,n ° ‘
advantages of honesty and exactitude. •
annual statistics stand in sober contrast ,
the wild and wonderful guesses, estinn ■
and subterfuges of the other departure ■
and. except for the recently re-constiti
salt tax, its returns are the only 1
that do not savor of comic opera m
Budget which is solemnly presented to .
nation every twelvemonth by respons
Ministers. Controlled and manned by
ishers to load British and foreign traa
the interests of the Chinese, it_ fo. rnl V‘
better example of what Western cl^ 11S! i 0 i e
at its best must stand for than the w


fabric of British commercial enterprise and
missionary effort. The present highly-
developed posts and telegraphs were an off-
shoot from the 1.M.C., which, amongst its
multitudinous activities, surveys and lights
the coasts, beacons the rivers and provides
the bulk of the funds the Government ex-
pends internally, besides paying the interest
on loans and indemnities.
The canal led to that great artery, the
Grand Canal, and a constant stream of
vessels passed up and down, swinging in to
the Customs station to present their papers
and clearing out again. A “boat-train”
would go by, a sturdy steam-launch towing a
procession of crammed native houseboats
like a string of railway-carriages behind it.
Tide and wind were working together, and
the great mat sails of the cargo boats glided
by wbth quiet and impressive speed. Small,
elegant houseboats carrying officials or well-
to-do merchants and their wives and concu-
bines flitted past, and huge hayricks piled on
punts drifted on the current. Against the
tide went another .swift procession, towed by
ropes from the bank. The pullers, yoked
into a long painter, tugged and panted, rac-
ing around obstacles and clambering over
bridges, for a pittance of a few cash a day.
Along either bank of the canal went an end-
less troop of wheelbarrows bearing astonish-
ing mounds of merchandise and propelled by
sweating coolies, whose plaintive song min-
gled with the squealing of the wheels to
make a weird land-chanty. Behind them
stretched the fiat green crops, pungently fer-
tilised with the nightsoil from the cities. It
was a wonderful picture of the indomitable-
ness of Chinese industry .which each succeed-
ing year, despite war and brigandage, cor-
rupt officialdom and weak central govern-
ment, persists in providing bigger and bigger
trade returns.
Narrow steps led up from the water’s
edge to the gateway of a small, dilapidated
temple, dedicated to an upright and honest
official who lived in the Golden Age before
this era of corruption and provincial
tyranny. There is a current saying that
there will be found but two honest officials
in the whole of Chinese history. One of
these is already dead, the other yet unborn.
Perhaps this was the former. His image,
repainted, still stood behind a broken shrine
on which incense had been freshly burned.
Possibly the fat little man, arrayed in dingy
foreign dress, who sat in front of the likin
office, guarded by soldiers with rifles, would
in the course of years be deified, too. There
was a school in the temple precincts where
a teacher of the modern type presided over
the education of 30 small shaven scholars.
The teacher had an English vocabulary of
portentous fragments, which floated up in
his speech like bits of ornate wreckage from
a torpedoed liner; but beyond these relics of
a college training he was quite incomprehen-
sible and equally unable to understand us.
His modern methods of teaching had deteri-
orated along with his foreign speech. Ilis
pupils had reverted to the time-honored way
of learning the classics. Each was a class
unto himself, and was bawling at the top
of his voice his own lesson. The school-
master walked amidst the tempest un-
harmed, like a demi-god caught in a terres-
trial storm. They played this pleasant game
together from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and seemed
to like it. There was no vestige of discip-
line. Each bawled his individual song, or
slept or gaped as inspiration, which Chinese
physiology places in the abdomen, moved
him. The teacher’s wage was 4sd. a week.
Amongst his bulbous-headed brood, in the
old democratic days of competitive /examina-
tion, there might have been a future Minis-
ter of State or a senior-wrangler of the
Empire. In these Republican days one has
to don spectacles and go to America, to come
back fearsomely arrayed in blob-toed shoes
and a Broadway suit, with a mind stuffed
with Western science and Western thought,
a heart secretly ambitious, and a mouth full
of fine phrases culled from John Stuart
Mill. Henry George and Theodore
Roosevelt. One then either drifts into the
revolutionary clubs of the foreign settlements
and uses one’s knowledge of chemistry to
make bombs or is appointed superintendent
to the local likin station, with a squad of
soldiers and a war-junk with a real brass
cannon aboard to guard one from the fury
of the mob. In the latter event one sits
down to apply to Chinese trade superior
Western methods of squeeze and peculation
vastly more profitable and outrageous than
the old.
Before condemning Chinese venality out-
right. it is as well to remember that Europe
only acquired a conscience of recent years.
It is scarcely a hundred years ago that Pitt
began his campaign against a system ot
bribery and corruption so universal and con-
doned that the House of Commons thought
that the discovery of a culprit amongst
its members was a subject fit only for hilari-
ous laughter: just as they laugh to-day
when the Speaker is inadvertently served
with a summons to do national service. The
British Customs Department in the time of
George 11. was not one whit better than
the Chinese likin is to-day. In one year of
that glorious reign £750,000 was _ collected
on wines and tobaccos, of which only
£160.000 reached the Exchequer! A single
article of import might be subjected to more
than a dozen different duties. Corruption is
not peculiar to any one form of govern-
ment. Republican America can be as venal
as despotic Russia. Britain, having, after
shameful days, attained to a purity of ad-
ministration probably unequalled in the
world, has just uncovered an ugly cesspool
which party politics has long been fostering
on the premises. Corruption is a Devil
hard to exorcise. With the Chinese it is a
national habit: but the magnificent and suc-
cessful effort to throw oft the deadlier habit
of opium-smoking shows what potentialities
for spiritual regeneration China has in her.
In their zeal for reform some of the provin-
cial governors burned their opium-smokers.
Perhaps a little burning of provincial gover-
nors may help in depopularising the other
vice. . . . .
Just as I was abandoning my compatriot
1o his loneliness, a cargo-boat made last
alongside, and the laodah, preparatory to
starting negotiations with the master, passed
up a packet of soap to the receptive cook.
He was not adroit enough ; and I started on
my way with such a torrent of Chinese
\ ituperation mixed with good Australian
oaths ringing in my ears as seemed to take
the wind out of all the junk-sails in the land-
scape.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Food and Clothing; in Germany.
Dear Bulletin,—An Australian girl from
Berlin dropped into our flat here in London
yesterday like an angel ghost. Twenty-seven
months ago, in spite of my expostulations,
she insisted upon throwing in her lot with
her married sister —she has no other relative
—whose husband was then in the German
Embassy in Constantinople. Out of the fur-
nace. but not unscorched ! Her late mother
was almost aggressively English, and Hell
itself could not shake nationality out of
Nancy Robinson, for she is British to the
core and returns as she left. It is untrue, as
reported to The Bulletin in May. 1916.
that she became a naturalised German. If
she had done that she would not be here now.
Her story is full of interest. The whole
time was spent in Berlin. At first there
was no real squeeze for food. Things were
dearer, much on the same scale as in Lon-
don to-day. Gradually the pinch grew tighter,
until absolute necessaries have become
wholly unprocurable save by the plutocrats.
Miss Robinson speaks little German, but
was game to’ stand for hours with irate
housewives in queues to get the family’s
share, per card, of food. The butter limit
was jib. weekly, but of late unobtainable.
Potatoes, like other articles, often sold out
and the queue must disperse, disconsolate.
Wertheims—the Whiteleys of Berlin —
made a brave show of clothing, even of
fashions, but the prices were monstrous and
quality deceptive. Woollen goods of all
kinds —and this is what should interest us
most —are all but impossible to get. Hence
we may be sure that the Boche Army is also
ill supplied for the fierce winter that must
again be faced. Cotton is scarce and dear.
A dearth of all manufacturing materials is
openly declared. All leather, even scraps,
lias long since been requisitioned. Brass
window bolts, door-handles and stove fittings
have been gathered in. Church-bells, though
not all, have been removed for foundry pur-
poses. The populace, though discontented,
is still well under military control. Attempted
meetings in the Potsdamer Platz were
quickly dispersed, the soldiery enclosing all
converging streets, “according to plan.” and
thus localising any disturbance. But. back
of it all. the Imperial family is increasingly
unpopular, both males and females. The
generals are no longer gods and distrust is
scarcely concealed. There are even said to
be meetings of people of the “better classes”
in the swagger Hotel Adlon to discuss radi-
cal changes. In short, the ferment has be-
gun ; but to anyone who knows the Boche
all ferment will be futile until it includes
the sergeant and the sehiitzmann. They
only can put the kybosh on the'Kaiser.—
Yours, Octavius C. Beale.

The Disease and the Microbe.
Three or four dozen men were drafted into
the police courts of Australia last week and
sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for
being members of the I.W.W. This is what
the Law provides, the I.W.W. being an
"unlawful” association. But it is no use
gaoling these men if the doctrines of the
I.W.W. continue at large. Men have been
gaoled ever since prisons came into fashion,
and before that many had their heads lopped,
on account of holding unpleasant opinions ;
yet few religions or theories have perished
because the persons who held them were
locked up or killed. This paper looks upon
the I.W.W. as an imported disease, and is
more concerned about impounding the
microbe than about segregating a certain
number of patients. The real problem
the Legislature is up against in con-
nection with this organisation is not whether
the corporate existence of the I.W.W. is
destroyed by the vigilance of the police, but
whether its doctrines are absorbed by other
brotherhoods. And it is not much good
pretending that they are escaping absorp-
tion. So long as public money is expended
on the promotion of loafing—and millions
have been so spent in Australia of recent
years—and so long as the administration of
the Arbitration system is conducted in such
flagrant defiance of the spirit and letter of
the law as was revealed, for instance, in
the last big X. S. Wales coal strike, the
theories of the I.W.W. can be depended upon
to spread far and wide, even though every
member on the roll be deported beyond the
equator. The theory that there are no
advantages in going slow, and that system-
atic striking is not a payable proposition,
will never be exterminated by public policy
proving the contrary. It is a rotten theory,
disastrous in the end to individuals and to
the State; but he is a painfully-unobserv-
ant citizen who holds the I.W.W. entirely
responsible 'for its growth and acquits the
more sinister system of party government
that has in this country prostituted princi-
ples and the public cashbox for political
support.
The Fools of the Pit.
“Rope Boy” : Some years ago a British
Labor leader, on his return to England after
a tour, scornfully described the miners of
Australia as “damned fools.” Once more
we are proving how accurate his summing-up
was. With better conditions of work, shorter
hours and higher pay than ever coalminers
had before, we have dropped tools and are
idling about while our families are going
short, and the tradespeople are warning us
that no more goods can be supplied without
the money. Why are we idle, and at whose
behest? I’m d —if I know, nor have I met
a fellow-worker who can tell me. We are
told that we gave authority to a committee
to call us out when the proper time arrived,
and that this committee will also order us
back to work when its members think fit.
In the meantime w T e must tighten our belts
and ask no foolish questions. But who is
on this committee that we should give it
greater powers than even Kaiser Bill pos-
sessed? If we could only find out, it’s a
thousand to one that some of these gentle-
men were in the Old Dart when that re-
turned leader gave his candid opinion of the
Australian workers. Yes, he was right! As
long as a man can get on a platform and
blab about “fighting the capitalistic class”—
whatever that may. mean —we are satisfied.
He’s the man for Galway! We are not even
loyal to our own, for, when the opportunity
comes, we turn out good, honest battlers and
proved workers from union positions and
put in the lately-arrived gentleman with the
oily tongue. To any loyal mate who pro-
tests, we say: “Why, he has had a Univer-
sity training!” Of course, that is only one
of the glib stranger’s many lies, but we are
a credulous lot. Another question : Why are
coalminers, of all people, supporting a lot of
loafers in their opposition to a card system?
Aren’t we working under a similar system
ourselves? And what a howl we would raise
if it was proposed to abolish it! Every skip
of coal raised to the surface carries on it the
token of the man who has hewed and filled
it. At the end of the fortnight his pay is
computed on the quantity of coal sent to the
surface. Then why object to the card system
for others? It would be better for the
majority of us if we objected in a convincing
way to the three-card trick now being played
on us.
The Imperial Trade Tout.
Willy’s wire to Nikky, October 27, 1904 :
You ought not to forget to order some new ships,
which will be excellent persuaders during the peace
negotiations. Our private firms will be most glad to
receive contracts.
There you have the monarch in commerce
touting for trade for his country with all the
enthusiasm of a traveller for a new whisky.
The private firm, being made up of private
individuals, abhors war, in which it might
get hurt, and in which it is sure to be
robbed. But war possibilities, which mean
contracts, which in turn mean dividends, are
a totally different matter. To spread the
war interests as widely as possible in the
days of peace is the job of kings and politi-
cians who intend sooner or later to fight.
The more private firms there are to handle
the machinery of stoush. and the more share-
holders there are, the easier it is to get votes
for armaments; and the armaments once
ordered and paid for out of the public purse
the easier it is to get up an agitation to use
them, and so get something, or appear to get
something, for your money. No better argu-
ment than the Kaiser’s telegram just pub-
lished has ever been advanced against per-
mitting private interest to have even a finger
in the pie of war preparation. Even after
the present commotion some sort of big mili-
tary arrangements may still be necessary;
but there should be a very hard line drawn
against private profiteering in the machinery
of death.

Enterprise in German New Guinea.
Ernest Osborne’s observations :
On the spoken word or implied understanding that
investors and capital were cordially welcome to
develop the territories, a few Australian companies
acquired land in German New Guinea before the
outbreak of the war. Land was offered cheaply on
conditions which could not well be easier. The
authorities were benevolent, and no perceptible dis-
tinction in treatment was made between Australian
and German planters. The Government was eager
for development; labor was plentiful and cheap.
Thus favored, planters—individuals and companies—
pushed ahead. The result to-day is a picture of
growing wealth displayed on an equally imposing
scale in no other part of the world.
Beginning well down the straits separating New
Britain and New Ireland (formerly N'eu Pommern
and Neu Mecklenburg), the Gazelle Peninsula is
covered with plantations. Cape Gazelle to its very
point is being cleared and planted. Thence for many
miles into Blanche Bay, far as eye can see, steadily
rising from the beach in serried, perfectlv-straight
rows, the cocoanut palms run inland in graceful
upward sweeps. Herbertshohe (now Kokopo) stands
among immense wealth-producing plantations in the
heart of this marvellous district, almost facing the
Mother and Daughter volcanoes across the bay.
Spread over a one-time mangrove-swamp, beautiful
and unhealthy Rabaul, with its imposing wooden
buildings, graces Simpsonhafen, overshadowed by the
brooding volcano.
The principal development in New Britain, New
Ireland, Bougainville, and on the rich agricultural
flats around Madang on the New Guinea mainland
is in copra production, though some cocoa and
rubber are also grown. The Neu Guinea Oompagnie,
most aristocratic of German colonial concerns;
“Forsayth’s,” otherwise Die Hamburgisches Sudsee
Actien Gesellschaft, successors to “Queen Emma”
Fersa.vth’s magnificent plantations—these and “Herrn-
sheims” are making immense profit with copra at
present prices; 200 per cent, on the capital is a con-
servative estimate.
Of the immense profits but a small proportion
benefits white men locally. White men do not
generally live there long enough to reap any consider-
able benefit from their enterprise. “Forsaytn’s” and
a few others excepted, the' most magnificent estates
on the main as well as on the outlying islands,
including the Mortlocks, with lovely homes and great
incomes, are owned by Samoan ladies, wives of the
white men who gave their lives for the development
of the territories. These women, many of them
capable in business above average men, are not so
readily affected by the inimical climate as the
majority of whites. From the other plantations the
lion’s share of the wealth goes to shareholders in
temperate climates.
A matter closely affecting Australian enterprise
in these territories should receive attention. Some
companies hold options over land actually under
development. The German laws are equitably admin-
istered, to the satisfaction of all concerned, by the
Australian Administration, and it might be possible
to adjust matters so that the determinations would
be binding in the final war-settlement. Thus the
doubt about the future now entertained by Australian
companies operating in the N.-W. Pacific would be
set at rest. This would also make possible to Aus-
tralians the acquisition of land available in regions
whose natural development seems destined to pro-
gress under Australian control. Labor is still plenti-
ful and cheap (four to five shillings per month with
the simplest of food, trifling perquisites and
quarters), but the labor recruiter’s price has risen
from £5 to £7 10s. per recruit. For plantations
where the labor is known to be poorly fed, defrauded
of its perquisites, overdriven, neglected when sick,
and where laborers die, the boys refuse to sign on.
The old-established plantations and plantations known
for fair dealing have little difficulty in securing labor.
And that gives a hint to the white official. Tt is
of the utmost importance that Australians who may
go to Australian-owned plantations in the N.-W.
Pacific, giving health and life itself for shareholders’
benefit, should be adequately protected in regard
to accommodation, fares, salaries and medical atten-
tion on the plantation, by Australian legislation.
A beginning should be made by scrutinising the
agreements which employees are required to sign by

So far John Fell, who has resurrected the
Commonwealth Oil Corporation’s business at
Newnes (N.S.W.), lias received little
encouragement from either the Government
or the workmen ; and if it had not been for
the Protection afforded by Kaiser Bill’s sub-

for it was turned down because it would

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
White, bled white! I am bleeding still!
Over my shapeless fields
The stalks are stripped, and the full ears
thin
And the sheaves to the binding.are gathered
in,
In the harvest that battle yields.
Terrible, tireless, moon by moon
Waits for his guerdon the Reaper grim ;
Out of my dwindling garner, soon
What shall I offer him?
The soil gapes black in the furrows bare,
And the naked clods in the stubble show,
Save for a patch where, here and there,
A few fair wheat-ears grow.
My eyes are keen by the pasture-wall
And my arms are strong by the pasture-
gates ;
Shall I render you. though the ears be few,
The fields where the Reaper waits?
Spilling and spreading, as runs the stain
Of new-shed blood on snow,
The hordes of the East swept up from Spain
To Gascony. Quercy and old Touraine.
In the red days long ago.
Hard by Tours and the river-marge
There stands a field that is known to you,
Where the Saracen broke to my white-hot
charge.
When Martel hammered through :
And though on the slope of Roneevaux
My Roland lay on his broken sword.
I strove to the winning, as all men know,
Mighty before the Lord !
Shall vou covet the streams that mv sires
held.
Or thresh in the barns where my fathers
flailed ?
Shall your flag rank where the green flag
sank
And Abderahmed failed?
Since, long since when my coast lay stark
To pillage and torch and shame.
Scoffer and spoiler of creeds and kings.
With the salt wind wet on his helmet-wings,
The long-haired Northman came.
The grey seas foamed to his galley-sweeps;
From Texel down to the ruined South.
His scaling-towers lay by the keeps
His camps at the river-mouth ;
His long keels swung on the harbor-bars,
And Paris flamed by the reddened Seine,
Yet, from the scorn of my threefold scars,
Stricken, I rose again !
Shall new lies level the olden hope
Or the moments mar what the ages make?
Can you break the pride, and the strength
beside,
That Rollo could not break?
Comradely over the English hand
My own hand rests and grips;
Flank to my flank for your overthrow
This England stands, whom my fields know
As the old seas knew her ships.
Doggedly (such is the English lot)
Her footmen harried my choicest spears.
Her gaunt kings rode and her bowmen shot
For the half of a thousand years !
Arrogant (such is the English way),
Tried in the fire and tested true,
Once at Trafalgar and Vigo Bay,
Cressy and Waterloo!
Shall swine be stalled where the lion lay.
Or truth in the mart stand stripped and
sold ?
Can yon fetter fast, can you hold at last
What England could not hold?
I have known the fulness of those that feast.
The leanness of those that lack ;
I have bedded with hunger and drunk with
guile,
Province and march have I lost awhile;
But my arm shall win them back.
Careless and chivalrous, fierce and free,
Heedless of cavil or blame or praise.
I have walked in the gloom of the Jacquerie
And the gleam of the Hundred Days.
I have felt the favor of fortune wide.
The veering of change and of fickle chance,
Yet ever, through passing of time and tide.
I have loved her, this my France!
By the tale of your thousand thousand dead.
By this my blood on the sodden grass.
It is thus and so ye may read and know
My will — you cannot pass!
White, bled white! lam bleeding yet!
But while one pulse shall thrill.
While one, but one, red drop shall start
Warm from the valor within my heart.
That heart shall mock you still!
Silently (such is France’s way.
The new. strange way of her later birth)
I guard, till the dawm of the newer day.
My fields that are sacred earth.
See where the Reaper, passing through.
Left us but litter and stubble-rows.
And standing ears that are fair, though few ;
A sweet, strange flower grows.
Seed of my labor and blood and breath
Here in the soil that is holy ground.
This red bloom springs from the wreck of
things—
The soul that France has found!
victoria.

SYDNEY H. CARY, Chairman. G. HOWARD POPE, General ■
tions, the worker has now to pay quite lot)
per cent, more for his light than he did thiee
rears ago. The cost of production at Newnes,
a shade under lOd. a gallon, is just about
equal to the price at which imported oil
was being supplied to retailers before the
war: so something will have to be done
pretty soon if the industry is to survive.
The basic facts so far as Newnes is con-
cerned is that the output is about only one-
third of the capacity of the plant, and the
miners cannot be induced to increase the
supply of shale. Soon after Fell took
charge wages were increased about oU pei
cent. Theu shift work was substituted for
contract, and the output fell with a thud.
T T nder contract men put out three or tour
skips a day ; on shift work one or two is
‘considered a fair thing. If you told these
men that they were allies of the Oil rust
or supporters of colored labor they would be
indignant. Yet they unquestionably are
crippling a good Australian industry, to the
greater glory of the oil magnates of America
and the encouragement of the black-labor
product of the Dutch East Indies. And
while they magnify the foreigner they pmcu
the people at home. The co. used to make
large quantities of mineral-wax candles, good
enough to grace a shrine and cheap, enough
for the humblest home. But the industry
having been choked. Australians are paying
double rates for inferior imported candles.

-KussiA looks more like a stranded whale
every day. Last week the German threw
himself at Riga, whereupon what was left
of the local army melted iufi> the vastness
beyond, and when next heard from was
being assisted by the enemy’s cavalry as
pacemaker. The result of this is to make
the invaders masters of practical!j the
whole of Courland, and the next two ques-
tions relate to (1) the Russian naval force
in the Baltic and 12) Petrograd. There is
the usual story about the navy being ready
for eventualities. Also, as usual, it is
stated that the enemy will encounter great
difficulties in reaching the capital. Aone
of these allegations are worth the Russian
equivalent of 14d. Six months ago Russia
awoke and arose, for what purpose and in
obedience to what influence has never been
satisfactorily explained. Three months later
the army of the Revolution advanced undei
Brussiloff. Since then it has been
steadily going astern. At no stage did it
make even a decent excuse "for its existence,
and if the condition of the alleged "Front ’
be about the most awful into which such a
place can fall, the position at the rear seems
equally dreadful. With the shadow of
famine over the country in one direction and
demoralised armies on the run in another,
and no one in the length and breadth of the
land with even a figment of authority. no
great imagination is required to fill in the
blanks. Speculation on what Von llin pen-
burg intends to do next quite futile.
Apparently he can please himself. Any-
way, whether he takes a trip to go skating
on "the Neva is much more likely to depend
on his personal predilections than on any-
thing the Russian may do. If he has the
men to spare, the things that may happen to
Western and Southern Russia before General
Frost resumes command are not pleasant to
think about. That way the outlook is as
hilarious as the spectacle of a shipwreck
with 75 politicians struggling for the last
remaining lifebelt. Over at the other side
of the disturbance the fact that the Ameri-
can is under no delusions about either the
size of the job or the consequences of mak-
ing a dead-heat of it is the most satisfac-
tory aspect of the proceedings. 1 ncle
Sam is going about the business with his
mind made up that the individual with a
loud• whoop relating to an early decisive
victorv is merely a. noisy liar. This atti-
tude of mind calls for continual encourage-
ment, for of all the pestiferous nuisances
the Allies have had to overcome, the indi-
vidual and the newspaper and the
book written in 24 hours proclaiming
Germany to be at the last gasp have
been the most sinister. During the summer
now passing away the German armies on
the Western Front have stood up to the
heaviest punishment ever inflicted in battle,
and have hit back hard and often. _ There is
no getting away from this, nor is it any use
pretending that a broken Germany can
be detected. The Allies have a long way to
go yet. And they will get some bumps on
the journey. It is more than possible that
some of those bumps are waiting for our
own men and their mates in Palestine, that
theatre-ought to have more attention from
the “heads” than it is getting. _ In particular
the supply and quality of allied aeroplanes
in use on that Front is worth attention. It
isn’t pleasant to hear of Australian and
English hospitals being repeatedly bombed
from the sky. It suggests that things are
not being made unpleasant enough for the
bombers.

“Julius Caesar,” as played at Melbourne
King's last Saturday, is worth seeing by all
friends of Sliakspeare, if only for the admir-
able first act, which here extends into the
third division of the classic tragedy, closing
with the removal of the corpse of the notori-
ously dead Dictator from the Senators
Chamber. Not that the interest ends there.
The present version is still a fine play
throughout the second act (containing only
the Forum scene, with Cmsar’s body placed
on a funeral pyre below the pulpit where
Brutus and Antony deliver their orations)
and right to the end of the Tent scene in the
final section. True, the idea of burning the
late lamented in the Forum, instead of tak-
ing him off to the sacred crematorium, is a
melodramatic anachronism ; yet it serves its
lurid purpose, and would be a Quite success-
ful scenic interpolation if the pyre were
rather more imposing, and the cries of the
crowd leading up to the conflagration in the
streets beyond were clearly distinguishable.
The action of the mob is most hurried when
it should he most explanatory, owing to the
fact that there isn't a large enough mob in
the first place, and the spokesmen are chosen
from the principals of the co., who, having
no business in the hurly-burly, are trying to
disguise their voices. The opening of the
last act in the tent of Brutus carries the
narrative on without a break. But when
the warfare begins the air of grows
very murkv. Any production of “Julius
Caesar” is ’bound to wilt at the battle end.
The same weakness attaches to “Richard
III.” The action becomes scrappy and con-
fusing. The various scenes that the Bard
places under the stereotyped heading of
“another part of the field” are here conhned
to only one part of the field, the monotony
being broken by a tableau which is alleged
to indicate the triumph of Antony’s side.
And this one scene, littered with stage rocks,
is supposed to be the Plains of Philippi,
where the respective leaders of the opposing
forces stand and call one another names.
The spectacle of Brutus and Cassius, on the
one hand, standing on a rocky elevation to
exchange incivilities with Marc and Octa-
vius on the other side of the nuobled land-
scape, is not imposing. And the effect of
warriors going away for three minutes in
order to return to the same spot for dying
purposes becomes somewhat tiring. It is
unavoidable, but it is not war. Evidently
the scrap can’t be getting any for’arder it
all the chief contestants are wandering
around the same little hit of broken country
all the time. It might as well be trench
warfare in Flanders. The author made a
convincing conclusion to the pl&y practically
impossible. And if he hadn't it couldn't he
done at the price, or within an ordinary time
limit. The King’s production is done mighty
well at the price, and it lasts till past 11 p.m.
* * * *
Among the performers Greenaway comes
an easy first with his smooth, refined imper-
sonation of Cassius, the observant, scholarly,
smileloss man who objects to anyone being
greater than himself, and lias a keen eye for
the perquisites of office. Greenaway gets
inside the somewhat lagoic character. More-
over, lie looks it outside, and his elocution
is a pleasure. The lines of C ass i us . could
hardly be more effectively spoken in the
opening scene, where they are all important,
and in the Quarrel scene, where he appears
to be the injured party. George Bryant’s
rumbling diction is more at home in the Tent
scene than in previous parts of the play, for
he is always a good conversational actor.
He makes the honesty of Brutus terribly
rugged, with his tongue and his legs, too. and
it is only in the rough kindliness of his
manner that he seems to be the noblest
Roman of them all. His speech from the
Forum pulpit leaves one in doubt as to
whether the artful Antony wasn’t gammon-
ing when lie spoke of Brutus as an orator in
the florid sense of the word. lan Maclaren’s
Antony is not more oratorical than the pre-
vious speaker. lie makes the points of his
speech to the multitude in a barristerial
manner, like a counsel addressing tlm jury.
He doesn’t give the impression of a politician
stirring up the feelings of the mob. If the
scene were so placed that the bulk of the
mob could only be heard roaring and groan-
ing in the wings, thus creating an atmo
sphei-e Of crowd/ and if Marc someUmes
shouted to make himself heard afai o ,

run J It is up to Melbourne to see that the
theatre is crowded all the time.
Miriam, who flaunted her red Jjat in ‘‘Out-
cast” at Melbourne Royal on Saturday, is
not the casual harlot of popular Action. She
is an ornament of the profession *ho in-
stantly dissipates the prejudice her head
r excites by revealing all the little tneK
of womanliness and sincerity with which the
respectable married female makes herseljf
tolerable to her husband. Miriam s quality
is demonstrated in her encounter with tl
firs? man who has the mental eminence to
pitv her position. Rescued from the streets
hv'a voung financier, who is steadily doping
a system already overcharged with disap-
pointed passion, she responds solici-
tude with unexpected refinements—indeed
even betrays a knowledge of Byron and
shows sufficient ladylike restraint to ■>
her hunger with half a banana,
he concludes that the society of tbe /adj
would make life more livable, so he offeis hei
the freedom of his time and income, and
they are soon held in a bond of mutual re-
generation, both vastly improving by e
experience and generally creating a beautiful
atmosphere wherein curates could nibble
cake without loss of decorum. By Act in
the attachment has an air of permanency
and politeness, and people expect a graceiu
finish to the delicate business of making
Miriam respectable. But hereabouts the
Other Woman, who drove the hero to a
course of whisky and opiates, sneaks back
into his arms and pretends to be a boulder
on Miriam’s road to salvation, fortunately
the Other Cat isn’t the stuff of which
divorcees are made, and she eventually re-
turns to her hubby leaving Miriam to resume
the old alliance on the same terms as before.
* * * *
Miss Maedonell plays Miriam principally
in the lower register. Even in her. angriest
passages there is no noticeable heightening
of tone, but rather a hoarseness and explosive
breathlessness which seem to blow her sen-
tences to pieces and hardly allow her to
retrieve a solid word from tlie massacre. It
is somewhat showy work in a. passe style
of acting, but it is less impressive than her
sure, nonchalant touches in the first act.
The part of her boy, Geoffrey, is effectively
millinered by Waldron et Oie. There never
was such an exquisite exponent of free love.
He wears his feelings like decorations and
puts his dialogue into gaiters, so to. speak.
I? all Nuts resembled Charles Waldron,
flappers wouldn’t consider marriage worth
while. Louis Kimball and Lewis Willoughby
correctly express the chivalry of the well-
bred man in irregular situations, and
Plumpton Wilson is a perfect servant. .Miss
Beryl Bryant is Geoffrey’s first love. Valan-
tine. She has a warm voice that goes well
with brown velvet and her brunette coloring,
but she keeps her reserves of soul for her
kisses. Apart from her canoodly moments
with Waldron, she appears to regard life as
a bit of a bother.
“You’re In Love.” the now musical play
by the manufacturers of “High Jinks,” made
its strike-delayed start at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney, last week-end, with Maude Fane
leading with confidence and charm in a
Dresden-doll part that hadn’t previously
been worn by Dorothy Brunton. It involves
her in seven songs and gives her no chance
to show how amusing she can be in a frump-
ish hat and a macintosh. Still that can be
held in reserve while she sings and looks like
something off a wedding cake. The brightly-
mounted trifle, with a hotel sun-parlor for
the first, act and for the second an elaborate
steamer deck “set” with a swinging boom
that supports Maude Fane over the heads
of the front stalls, has Californian sunshine
in it and not much ragtime. The first trio
(a daintily-scored number) is almost
stately, and No. 2 on the musical list is
the first plain trace of “rag.” The plot was
probably written in full on the back of an
envelope while the librettist waited for a
car or a cocktail. An incredibly nervous
and croaky young man ("William Greene)
allows himself to be married by dry legal
contract to his piuk-and-fluffy girl (Maude
Fane), who lives in stage dread of her curi-
ously old-maidish aunt —a grass widow three
times removed from her husbands. This bleak
well-brushed tyrant (Connie Ediss) hates all
men so much that she loads the marriage
contract with clauses which keep the newly-
weds on mere nodding terms till the end of
the second act. It is the fretful Connie’s
monotonous job to plod through the enter-
tainment like a female referee commandin'*
the two clinging principals to part and box
on. Her No. d husband (Alfred Frith) is
a scared, ostrich-like African missionary
with redeeming traces of Sin, who has some-
how got the job of guardian or keeper to
the contract-hobbled bridegroom. Talleur
Andrews and Cecil Bradley hover round as a
newly-wed pair with no author-made troubles
who can only express their unfathomable
content in polite songandance. Field Fisher
makes a few welcome intrusions as a
pathetic, fatuous, sun-boiled bo’s’n who in-
dulges in dismal deep-sea roarings and pip-

“Excelsior.” The specialty dancing is un-
usually good. La Sheila, a new soloist
from England with a vivid and distinctive
style, wnirls through a joyous “\ ictory
dance wearing the Cap of Liberty and waving
two flags; Madge Elliott droops gracefully
as an animated rose; and Jack Hooker, lom
Preston and little Rita Nugent rattle humor-
ously as three impossible sailors. The finish
of the “ballets, dances and groupings"
entitles Minnie Hooper to special mention.
The co. which finds “Turn to the Right”
almost enough to travel on permanently has
given Adelaide a look at a fresh play, the
New Henrietta.” At least, it is fresh in this
country. The word “New” in the title,
though having no meaning at all in connec-
tion with the story, is understood to indicate
that an old play by one Victor Mapes, lhe
Henrietta,” has been brought up to date d\
Winehell Smith. The Winehellising process
is manifest at every turn. Old Nick, mil-
lionaire financier of N’York. is disappoints
in his idle sou Bertie, and entrusts all his
affairs to Turner, a son-in-law, who thus
stands to get the whole fortune barring one
beggarly million with which Bertie has been
sent adrift. Yet this Turner-fool plans to
ruin Nick within one week. Of course
Bertie foils him. At the moment when
Henrietta shares are knocked out, tie
young man drifts in with bis m
‘lion and saves the situation without having
any idea how. And how lie incidents

is the moral of the Vitagrapli film at the

music in a strangely
bogus capacity.
“The Cinema Star”
is not a musical
comedy that any-
body can win im-
mortal renown in,
but it has got to
work for the nay-
box until Friday.
On Saturday comes “Mr. Manhattan.”
described as a musical cocktail.
“Seven Days’ Leave” has attained its fifth
week at Melbourne Princess’s, where Colonel
Styan and Captain Allan Wilkie will con-
tinue to blow out the Herman spies until
further notice.
Another comedy-acrobatic act lias been
added to the bill at Melbourne Tivoli, the
principal tumbler in this case being a clieeild
who springs somersaults with his or ner
hands clasped, as though in prayer. All the
other people are as before, and most ot them
are leaving this week. The one who will be
most missed is Ruth Budd.
The Vic. Artists' Spring show: —
The faithful are again called to Eastern Hill,
where Bernard Hall is once more the showiest per-
former, with the customary frozen nude whom a
comparatively warm color-scheme is trying to
thaw. He has another study of a red-lipped lady
with a violet mask tilting a carelessly-drawn wine-
glass in an alleged spirit of carnival. Both pic-
tures advertise Hall’s method of reducing Woman
to the neuter gender; and he fondly uses his fried-
egg effects as if he found most pleasure in vistas
of ruined breakfasts. The Yellow Peril has also
infected the art of Miss Mary Cecil Allen, who
obtains emphasis by posing a damsel in canary
trimmings. Harry B. Harrison has dodged tin;
labor of big endeavors and exercised his brush in
the limited area of “studies.” The most notable
is a well-drawn head of an old lady. In his sub-
stantial view of a female in a blue kimono, O.
Bowman Fletcher reveals an eye for the obvious
that never misses a leaf of the vegetation on the
gown. In “Missing,” a presentment of a familiar
grief, ,J. Ward Symons catalogues the immaterial
with a leaden hand. C. Povne’s “Black Hat,” on
the contrary, attempts to achieve ait by stealthy
suppression of details. Miss Roxburgh handles a
nude, “The Outcast,’’ with a feminine affectation
of masculine vigor. Delafield Cook's landscapes
are beginning to deserve a second look. He is
showing an agreeable artistic reticence and is keep-
ing his palette cool. In “A Summer Storm” C.
Douglas Richardson seems to have prepared a tree
for its portrait by frizzing out the foliage with
curling-tongs. Tom Carter solemnises the alleged
poverty of a cocky in a severe diagram of a gaunt
head. Miss Cumbrae Stewart continues her
implacable energy as a pastellist, and Miss Dora
Wilson robs a well-known visage of a good deal of
the interest it possesses in life. Miss Rose Walker
water-colors two interiors with good effect, but
G. H. Cassidy’s grey studies are eloquent of starch.
The drawing of F. C. Reynolds appeals to one from
several frames, but his outlook is blue with pessi-
mism. Miss D. M. Ellerman’s “Merry Meg” is ar.
elaborate pictorial treatise on an old dame and
some vegetables, with the ancient dutifully playing
super to the vegetables. Arnold J. Shore's Heidel-
berg sketch has considerable value among so much
pretentious amateurishness. The works of W.
Nicholls Anderson are also worthy of favorable men-
tion, along with the miniatures of Miss Golding and
the aquatints and etchings of F. A. Campbell and
P. W. Kernot.
* * * ;!*
Muriel Ostriche and Douglas Fairbanks
are the principal sights at the Melba
Theatre, Melbourne, this week. Muriel is
the popular fancy in “Moral Courage,”
whilst Fairbanks is a Bowery chucker-out
in his well-known disturbance, “Reggie
Mixes In.” At the Britannia Charlie
Chaplin is in “Easy Street” and Kitty
Gordon shows some more backbone in “The
Beloved Adventuress.” Also there is “Love’s
Law,” in which Stuart Holmes and Joan
Sawyer can be dimly discerned after the
dust of an erotic tussle has settled down.-
Matheson Lang has changed his clothes
and his century to go Shylocking melo-
dramatically for a week on Hoyt’s screens
in Melbourne. The old Jew could hardly be
so bad as he is here painted. Miss Hutin
Britton (Mrs. Lang) has a comfortable
style for the part of Portia, and it might
be noted incidentally that George Morgan,
formerly known in Melbourne as a seaside
entertainer, capers effectively as Launcelot
Gobbo. Also in motion at Hoyt’s are the
Haunted Pyjamas, which turn men into their
grandmothers and do other startling things.
Adelaide shows are getting busy. Marie
Tempest is coming in at the Royal, the
King’s reopens with an Italian Opera season
—a novelty for this little house—and, while
the Taits put up Cappelli and other favorites
there, Balboni opens at the Queen’s. Other
good music was given by Winsloe Hall’s
orchestra at the Exhibition. Prince’s
Players are still at the Majestic, which also
has the 3 Sailors in an absurd but funny
turn, and the Anderson Co. at the Tivoli
has switched off to bushranging drama. The
scene being American, they call it a “hold
up.” West’s make a great feature of Charles
Ray, a film artist who dances at least as
well as he acts ; Wondergrapli shows Pauline
Frederick as dramatic and Fatty Arbuckle
as foolish ; and the Pav., where a new big
Orchestral machine “plays” all day. gives
one more of those Warning to Girls dramas
which the authors claim to be moral lessons.
Simon Fraser, -who was one of the fossil
members of the first Federal Senate by the
grace of his old friend Syme, had an 85th
birthday recently. Time was when the old
man worried himself terribly about Rome,
but he has outlived that and is preparing
his soul for a heaven where both sects are
on the free list and even the Pope may have
a chance.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“N." : How’s this for artistic tempestu-
ousness V A visiting star (fern.) couldn’t
possibly go on the other night until her
stage-manager had retired and substituted
a dark suit of clothes for the light-grey he
was wearing 1

will be coming to
Australia before the
year is out. Howard
Edie, who booked
the Cherniavskys
for these parts, has
the lady under en-
gagement, and is
now running her
through the IT S.A.
Isolde was the girl
who gave a recital
when she was three
and a half, but was
not exploited as an
infant phenomenon.
Born in England,
she was sent to
Russia to study at
the Imperial Con-
servatoire before
making her debut
in London at the
Queen’s Hall four
years ago. She is
now 23, and her
appearance is al-
most as foreign as her name.
“0.1 v.” : Bailey and Grant’s venture with
“Julius Csesar” is the first staging # of the
tragedy in Melbourne since George Miln
produced it at the old Opera House a quar-
ter of a century ago. Oscar Asche did it
on the Town Hall platform, with a back-
ground of dark hangings, but that was only
a one-matin6e show. Miln’s production was
very respectable. The chief put a forcible
personality into the part of Marc Antony,
though it wasn’t a young and graceful per-
sonality. The most picturesque feature was
the actor in the name part —Collett Dobson,
lie had a high Roman nose and looked re-
markably like the medallion portraits of the
original J. Caesar. Kay Souper has the
height and bearing for a Julius, but his first
appearance is hardly as startlingly impres-
sive as that of the young Australian actor
of long ago. By the way. Greenaway, who
now plays Cassius, is said to have played
Caesar admirably in a N’York production,
though he is on the small side for such a
commanding billet. He comes much nearer
to the popular conception of a lean and
hungry Cassius.
“Up Stage”: “Julius Caesar” was last
played by Rignold at Her Majesty’s. Sydney,
in 1880. George R. headed a fine cast as
Marc Antony, in the bill being Cathcart
(Brutus'). Jewett (Cassius), Scott Tnglis,
Jack Sweeney and Joe Tolano. The piece
ran 10 weeks. Oscar Asche. with aspira-
tions to play Antony, seriously considered
staging “Caesar” during his first visit here,
but was content with a recital at Melbourne
Town Hall.
“Baldhead” : The third act of Tom Rob-
ertson’s “Caste,” put on in Sydney for the
benefit of the Actors’ Benevolent, saw a
departure from tradition. Herbert Ranson,
who played Capt. the Hon. George D’Alroy,
instead of presenting himself :'n mufti to his
heart-broken Esther, sported a uniform that
won a great cheer from the close-packed
goddesses. It was a blend of Indian Mutiny
cum Commonwealth periods, the captain’s
three stars on the shoulder-strap bringing it
right up to date. C’est magnifique —but not
what Tom Robertson intended. Dorothy
Cumming’s soul-stirring Esther atoned for a
little thing like that, and Frank Elliott’s
Major Ilawtree was reminiscent of Squire
Bancroft. If the half-promised revival of
“Caste” follows on “Grumpy’s” heels., the
management must provide D’Alroy with a
real live baby. The rag contraption he
clutched on this occasion set mammas snig-
gering where they should have been sobbing.
“Norbell”: Hear, hear! to “75,” who
observes that the perfect make-up for the
stage is “the sort of which the spectators
are unconscious” (B. 30/8/’l7). I’ve often
seen Nellie Stewart, who knows all about it,
come out on the brilliantly-lit stage before
the curtain went up in order to put the
finishing touches to her complexion under
active-service conditions. But some theat-
rical managers won’t have it so. I remem-
ber another good Australian mummer, Percy
Walshe, a pastmaster at make-up, playing ui
an Andersonian explosion at Melbourne
King's. As usual his preparation was about
perfect; but when the curtain fell on Act 1
the boss, who knew his public, charged round
from the front and complained in scandalised
accents, “You’ve got no make-up on
Walshe invited inspection. “Well, anyhow, ’
grumbled the aggrieved Bill, “you can t
notice it from the d.c.”
“B.B.”: Somebody got tangled over the
Finkelsteius. It is brother Mendel who
manages Adelaide Wondergraph. Phil is at
the old address —J. C. Williamson, Mel-
bourne.
The Australian Actors’ Assoc, now has
105 members in khaki. These include
Hareourt Beatty. Hugh Buckler, Laurie
Hardinge (brother of Bob Greigl. Reg
Wykeham, Derek Hudson. Alf Scarlett,
Marcus St. John, Paul Plunkett and Charlie
Lawrence; and another, Godfrey Cass, has
just been invalided back to Melbourne.
“Masetto”: Balboni, at Melbourne Audi-
torium, has my praise for not truckling to
the encore fiend. He sings his programmed
song and makes it apparent that he does
not want to give two or three more items
and walk on the platform and bow between
each. I don't think Melbourne has had the
encore madness so badly for 20 years. At
the Scotney-White concerts it got so fierce
that the male vocalist pleaded fatigue, cold,
gout and sea-sickness for not responding
further to the outrageous demands of the audi-
ences. But the lady never wearied of walk-
ing on, bowing in several fashions and sing-
ing something else. Dr. Price, Melbourne
city organist, allows no encores at the Muni-
cipal Concerts. A few weeks ago, _ pro-
ceedings were held up for fully 10 minutes
by the clamoring audience in its wild endea-
vor to force a repeat of one item ; but the
management sat tight and won.
(Continued on page J/3.)
F. J. Riley. a prominent Trades Hall
official with a raucous voice and Parliamen-
tary aspirations, addressed a crowd of pan-
kers after one of their recent attempts to
moh Parliament House, and naively urged
that the strikers “ought to meet every day
and have it explained to them just what it
was they were striking for and what it. all
meant.” Nobody laughed. The crowd just
yelled wildly and kept on striking for—for—
well, just kept on striking.
In its new Tramways Bill the Peacock
Government proposes that the tramways
shall pay to the Vie. Railways £50,000 a
year to recoup them for losses due to tram-
way competition. This means that citizens
guilty of travelling by tram will have to pay
fines, in the form of higher fares than would
otherwise be necessary, aggregating £lOOO
weekly. Probably if the Melbourne cab-
drivers make representations to Peacock he
will be prepared to increase the amount of
the fine inflicted upon the public and pay
compensation also to Jehu.
Westralia’s ex-Premier Jack Scaddan is
going to try to oust Johnson from Guildford
at the coming election. His chances are
poor. The fact is John is a discredited
politician—as a keener man would have
seen when he lost his old seat, Ivanhoe-
Brown Hill, a strong conscriptionist centre,
to Lutey, Avho is a pronounced Anti. But
Scaddan is one of the too-numerous. politi-
cians who understand a hint only when it
resembles a paving-stone.
October 7 has been set aside for “national
prayers” in Maoriland. All other days.-
judging by the food-profiteering that is going-
on. are reserved for national preyers.
Two veterans died on the same day in
Adelaide last week. One of them, J. M.
Wendt, was a standing instance of the folly
of judging a man by his name. He left
Denmark in 1854, to get away from German
rule, became naturalised in S.A. at once,
and at 87 was more bitter_tlian most Aus-
tralian-born against the Kaiser. Several
grandsons are at the Front; one of them
will never come back. The other veteran,
H. J. Gliddon, had a more varied career.
Grandson of Leigh Hunt, he was educated
in France; joined an uncle, an Adelaide
banker, in 3558; enlisted in Melbourne and
saw a lot of Maori fighting; served all over
the world, including Gibraltar and Jamaica ;
got back to Adelaide finally as a railway
man in 1885. He lived to be 79. and had
the military funeral which S.A. gives to all
such old warriors.
Of the attempt to Meagher the current
revolt by compromise :
The Lord Mayor took the chair punctually on the
hour. He was accompanied on to the platform by
Dean Talbot and Dean Archdall (Newcastle), who
took seats on either side.
Always seems to be a Dean or two in the
case when Richard is concerned.
VENGEANCE IS MINE.

The only actor qn this earth
Who (very privately)
Admits his own artistic worth
Is nil, was filled with glee;
And with proud swellings at the girth
Confessed his joy to me.

Where once they tried to hit
My worthy self with herb and root
They now in silence sit;
For he who throws the ancient fruit
Receives six months for it.”

YMR COMPLEXION
MAKES OR MARS YOUR APPEARANCE
rUrr 1 I will tell Every Reader of this Paper FREE
r IV. LiJu how to Remove Every Blemish in a Few Days.
GRACE DUNCAN, former actress, who
now offers to te 1 vomen of the most re-
markable complexion treatment known
This great beauty marvel has instantly produced a sensation.
Stubborn cases have been cured that baffled physicians and beauty
specialists for years. You have never in all your life used or heard
of anything like it. Makes muddy complexions, red spots, pimples,
blackheads, freckles, eruptions, vanish almost like magic. No
cream, lotion, enamel, salve, plaster, bandage, mask, mas-
sage, diet or apparatus, nothing to swallow. It doesn’t matter
whether or not your complexion is a "fright,” whether or not
your face is full of muddy spots, peppery blackheads, embar-
rasing pimples and eruptions, or whether your skin is rough
and “porey,” and you’ve tried most everything under the sun
to get rid of the blemishes. This wonderful treatment, in
just a few days, positively removes every blemish and beauti-
fies your skin in a marvellous way. You look years younger.
It gives the skin the bloom and tint of purity of a freshly
blown rose. In a few days you can be the subject of admira-
tion by all, no matter what your age or condition of health.
ALL METHODS NOW KNOWN ARE CAST ASIDE. There is nothing to wear, nothing
to take internally. Your face, even arms, hands, shoulders are beautified beyond your fondest dreams.
All this I will absolutely prove to you before your own eyes in your mirror in a few days. This treatment
is absolutely harmless to the most delicate skin, and very pleasant to use. No change in your mode of
living necessary. A few minutes daily does it. To every reader of this paper I will give full details of
this really astounding treatment. Let me show you. You risk nothing. Send me two penny stamps
and your name and address, and I will give you full details by return mail.

SHE: “Oh, yes, I think he loves me. But
lie's a vegetarian.”
HE: “Evidently thinks you're the pea.”
“Fax”: According to a decision given by
Judge Winneke in a Ballarat appeal case, the
public has for years been fooled by the term
“flannel” as applied to the material which
confiding citizens are advised to wear next
the skin. Dictionaries define it as “woollen
cloth,” but the dictionaries have not kept
pace with the tricks of the trade. Flannel
used to be a woollen material, but the fabric
has become more and more cottonised, until
at last, says John Dodgshun, warehouseman.
“1 per cent, of flannel would technically con-
stitute a flannel.” A piece of softgoods is
not what it is, but what the men who sell it
say it is. Said his Honor: —
Appellants had called a mass of evidence as to
the meaning of the term between buyer and seller,
which was of far greater value than a dictionary
definition.
And the public revenue is a party to this
imposition. Once upon a time the Con-
troller of Customs issued an order that
nothing less than 90 per cent, of pure wool
entitled a material to be called flannel. The
Trade appears to have over-ruled it with a
general disorder. Any feeble cotton fabric is
flannel that pays duty as woollen. The
Trade owes no duty to the public, as long as
JUST IN TIME.
HE : “ Er — y' know — er — I’d do anything on
this earth — er —for you.”
SHE: “Oh, thank you so much. I’m just
wanting another name for my Roll of
Honor.”
it pays duty to the Customs Department.
When Judge Winneke spoke of the "loose-
ness of the term flannel” he was too mealy-
mouthed. His Honor should have described
the term as horribly immoral and indecent.
It is one thing to be a bit loose, and another
thing to be grossly prostituted to the trade's
base purposes. Next time a gent, one is up
for misappropriation let him plead a trick
of the trade and see what happens. Presum-
ably nothing will happen if he quotes this
new precedent.
A cry from the Front: —
Keep on writing to us, you home people! You
all seem to flag if a man only stays away long
enough. The late reinforcements get the bulk of
every mail. Speak to any old hand and he will
tell you that he hardly ever gets any letters now.
It is going to he an effort to maintain interest in a
place with which there is no connecting link, and
with many the effort will not be made. It is not to
be wondered at that men who never hear from home
should form other friendships in a country where
the beauty of the women takes the breath away.
The Australian girls will have nobody but them-
selves to blame if Billjim goes home with a
smiling stranger’s photograph in his tunic pocket—
if he goes home at all.
• * * *
Billjim again. Four of him on convales-
cent leave at Boulogne borrowed a sailing-
boat from the w 7 ater-front of that once gay
spot, and set out across the Dover Straits
for Blighty, quite unmindful of any U-boats
that might be prowling around. They arrived
at Folkestone, to be received by the coast-
guard with open arms —and promptly handed
over to martial care. But the Heads were
lenient that day ; Billjim’s penalty was only
four days’ pay, and he reckoned the excur-
sion was worth the money.
A sympathetic brother moved at a recent
Melbourne meeting of the Tobacco Workers
Union that the concern’s total surplus ot
£250 should be devoted to the use of the
Strike Committee —and the motion was car-
ried. It seems a noble act, or a fatuous
one, according to the leanings of the ob-
server. But the £250 will certainly do nothing
in the way of making two mutton-chops grow
where there was but one before. It will merely
take the chops from one spot a M place them
in another, leaving nothing but a blank.
Considering all the funds that such bodies
have at their disposal from time to time, it
is a pity that some great union leader
doesn’t arise and suggest the formation of,
say. a Toilers’ Barracouting Society. V ith
£250 and a few 7 willing out-on-strikers,
enough cheap fish could be hauled out of the
bay to supply protein for hundreds of
workers’ families. As it is, the 500 ten-
bob coupons by means of which the £250
will be circulated —if the money ever gets
that far from the Trades Hall —will do
nothing whatever to add to the general food-
supply.
“Kassi Kassi” : Professor Preuss,
managing director of the German
New Guinea Co., recently men-
tioned in The Bulletin, was,
before our occupation, one of the
people who ran the show 7 in Kaiser
Wilhelm’s Land. I was on that
coast a few months before the
war, and it was Preuss, apparently,
who had to decide whether I w r as
to be admitted to the capital,
whether I could be allowed to take
photographs, and whether the
“Club” at Herbertshohe might be
permitted to take me in and do
for me at a high figure. He made
up his mind to grant all these con-
cessions : but I am bound to re-
mark that my camera fell sick with
some mysterious illness and any
photographs I took turned out
blank; also, I w 7 as not allow’ed to
sleep in Rabaul. and was carefully
misinformed about all the roads in
the neighborhood. A managing
director of a company is something
anywhere, no doubt, but not quite
all that Preuss appeared to be. I
fancy Berlin could have pinned a
different label on him had it chosen.
Incidentally, Stead’s publications
were lately, and I believe still are,
the only English magazines obtain-
able in Rabaul from German
stores; they are enthusiastically
spoken of by their sellers. As I
found them, the Germans right
through are firmly convinced that
the occupation is only for the
time. They laugh if you suggest
that anything else is possible.
“Pte. Enterprise”: There is a shanghaied
Billjim in Victoria and it happened like this.
A transport returning with sick and wounded
called at Fremantle (W.A.). Those proceed-
ing to the other States were given a few
hours’ leave ashore, and some of them were
detained by beer. Just before sailing time
a picket was sent down with orders to
gather the strays. After collecting a num-
ber the officer in charge saw a Billjim lying
on a green. As he could neither talk nor
walk, they carried him on board on a
stretcher. Next morning, well out at sea,
Bill woke up. stared at the waves and mut-
tered “ ‘Struth !” He belonged to Blackboy
Camp and had never been out of W.A. in his
life before.
On Sunday week members of the I W w
in Melbourne were pushing the sale of ™
particular book among the strikers
bled at a great Yarra Bank meetiii"- t+ m ‘
end tied “How to be Lazy.” One enthusS
offered it to a weary fragment spread on tlm

way ! If you knew as much about it as T
do, you wouldn't be hawkin’ it.”
EMANCIPATION!
FOND WIFE: “ Josiah , my dear, the baby can
walk!”
THE BRUTE: “Walk, can he! Well, he can
dam' well trot himself 'round to-night!”
When Billjim came down from Nineveh
When operations eased off in Mesopotamia all who
had been 12 months in the country were given
leave. We had a rotten trip down the Tigris, 200
of us aboard the little river boat, and 400 natives
on each barge. Every man was allotted 2ft. of
space on fhe deck, and we had the bad luck to be
placed right between the two funnels. Talk about
hot—it was a Turkish bath, 51 days of it, and all
on tinned tack !
The river from Baghdad to Kut-el-Amara is un-
interesting, and there is nothing much to see at
Kut, except the monument the Turks erected to
commemorate Townsend’s downfall. But the British
have made marvellous improvements along the river
and at the base, and there’s not the slightest doubt
about our intention to hold the place. After that,
three days at our former camp at Margil, the same
old dust, the same old Hades. Then from Basra to
Bombay, with lifebelt drill morning, noon and
night.
We had to report at Poona and take our month's
leave from there, being allowed to go to any hill
station. Most of us chose Darjeeling—from Cal-
cutta by a little toy train that you stoop to get
into. Then up and up 8000 ft., and, with any luck,
wc shall see the sun rise over Mt. Everest one of
these mornings.
Death rides some very close finishes.
A lad at Richmond (Vic.) enlisted early in
the war and served in Gallipoli and France.
His brother joined the A.I.F. last November
and embarked in January following. All
efforts to get in touch with one another
failed, until one day the soldier acci-
dentally discovered his veteran brother
in a neighboring camp behind the lines. They
had barely exchanged greetings when a visit-
ing enemy ‘plane dropped a bomb, killing the
Gallipoli campaigner outright and slightly
injuring the brother. Still the boys won by
a handclasp.
AN EVASION OF DUTY.

BATTLE PASSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A quaint old gabled cottage sleeps between the
raving hills.
To right and left are livid strife, but on the deep,
wide sills
The purple pot-flowers swell and glow, and o’er the
walls and eaves
Prinked creeper steals caressing hands, the poplar
drips its leaves.
Within the garden hot and sweet
Fair form and woven color meet,
While down the clear, cool stones, ’tween banks with
branch and blossom gay,
A little, bridged, blind rivulet goes touching out its
way.
Peace lingers hidden from the knife, the tearing
blinding shell,
Where falls the spattered sunlight on a lichen-
covered well.
No voice is here, no fall of feet, no smoke lifts cool
and grey,
But on the granite stoop a cat blinks vaguely at the
day.
From hill to hill across the vale
Storms man’s terrific iron gale;
The cot roof on a brooding dove recks not the distant
gun.
A brown hen scolds her chickens chasing midges in
the sun.
Now down the eastward slope they come.
No call of fife, no beat of drum,
But stealthily, and in the green,
Low hid, with rifle and machine,
Spit hate and death ; and red blood flows
To shame the whiteness of the rose.
Crash follows crash ; the bestial roar
Of ghastly and insensate war
Breaks on the cot. A rending stroke,
The red roof springs, and in the smoke
And spume of shells the riven walL
Pile where the splintered elm-tree sprawls.
From westward, streaming down the hill,
Shot-ravaged, thinned, but urgent still,
The brown, fierce, blooded Anzacs sweep,
And Hell leaps up. The lilies weep
Strange crimson tears. Tight-lipped and mute,
The grim, gaunt soldiers stab and shoot.
It passes. Frantic, fleeing death,
Wild-eyed, foam-flecked and every breath
A labored agony, like deer
That feel the hounds’ keen teeth, appear
The Prussian men, and, wild to slay,
The hunters press upon their prey.
Cries fade and fitful shots die down. The tumbled
ruin now
Smokes faintly in the summer light, and lifts the
trodden bough.
A sigh stirs in the trampled green, and held and
tainted red
The rill creeps o’er a dead man’s face and steals
along its bed.
One deep among the lilacs thrown
Shock all the stillness with a moan.
Peace like the snowflake lights again where utter
silence lies,
And softly with white finger-tips she seals a
soldier’s eyes.

CASTOR OIL, SALTS 4 DRUGS REPLACED
BY CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Delicious fruit laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels of
old and young' folks.
A delicious remedy for constipation,
biliousness, sick headache, disordered stom-
ach, indigestion, coated tongue, sallowness—
take California Syrup of Figs—“Califig."
For the cause of all this distress lies in a
torpid liver and sluggish bowels.
A tablespoonful to-night means all con-
stipation poison, waste matter, fermenting
food and bile gently moved out of your sys-
tem by morning without griping. Please
don't think of California Syrup of Figs—
“Califig”—as a physic. Don’t think you
are drugging yourself or your children. This
delicious fruit laxative cannot cause injury.
Even a delicate child can take it as safely
as a robust man. It is the most harmless,
effective stomach, liver and bowel regulator
and tonic ever devised.
Ask your chemist for a bottle of ‘’Califig"
—California Syrup of Figs, which has full
directions for babies, children of all ages and
for grown-ups plainly printed on the bottle.
Get the genuine, made by California Fig
Syrup Company. Refuse any other kind
with contempt. “Califig"—California Syrup
of Figs—is sold by all chemists in bottles of
two sizes, Is. lid. and Is. 9d. [3
If this certified yarn is true, somebody has
earned a cooling in the jug:—
When the eight militant unions held their monstev
meeting in Sydney Town Hall an orating boilermaker
said that “the tools of thousands of men are rusting
in the shops.” And the tools of scores are rusting
on the serapheap where they were thrown after the
strikers had deliberately smashed them before leaving
work.
From a Billjim officer in France-
The Hutl, after ceaseless work on his line, has had
to abandon it—one of the firstfruits of the Battle of
the Somme, Before evacuating the country he
methodically carried out the most awful acts of
brigandage and destruction. The whole countryside has
been laid Waste —-villages burned to the ground and
every tree cut to the roots. It is heart-breaking to see
fruit-trees —-whole orchards of them—lying on the
ground. Nothing was sacred. Churches are burnt
or blown up: even graveyards have been desecrated
for the purpose of getting the metal from the coffins.
In large towns, too, incalculable damage has been
done. I was in one two days after the evacuation.
The inhabitants’ homes and belongings had been
either looted or burnt, and they themselves collected
in one quarter. They had not tasted meat for six
months and would have starved had not the Ameri-
cans supplied them with foodstuffs. Yet the spirit
of these old people was magnificent. French flags,
long hidden, sprang out as if by magic and waved
over homes and ruins alike.
My only hope is that we shall have a free hand
among German villages before long. And I fiope
the French will take over the operations.

BILL: “No. I don't think I’ll ever many. I dread the thought of haring a mother-in-

It is better that I do not try any more.”
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos the
Pankhurst row outside Melbourne Parlia-
ment House. On August 9, 1860, the Nichol-
son Ministry resigned, and O’Shanassy,
Ebden and Heales were successively sent for.
The Land Bill was the cause of the crisis.
On August 22 Parliament met after an ad-
journment. Heales and Nicholson then
made explanations: the former said he had
required a promise from the Governor to
dissolve Parliament, and had been infused.
There was a great outcry about this, and
on the 28th a serious riot took place at
Parliament House. The row started at a
meeting in the Eastern Market. It was “a
vile attempt,” says one alleged historian,
“made by the Eastern Market mob to over-
awe Parliament. The Houses declined to
adjourn, though the building was rushed, and
many of the police were seriously injured.”
My own recollection is that the “mob” did
not enter the precincts at all. The Mayor, Dr.
Richard Eades, mounted the fence which
stood at the old gates, and while clinging to
a lamp-post read the Riot Act. Next day
the Parliament passed a Bill through all its
stages to prevent such meetings within a
• quarter of a mile of the House. This cov-
ered the Eastern Markets and ended the
•campaign there.

“F.N.T.” : The Melbourne Public Library,
with its generous breathing facilities, has
set a high standard in sanitation; but the
case is terribly different in some of the sub-
urban free libraries. The committees of
these concerns seem to take but a perfunc-
tory interest in their duties. At Prahran,
for instance, there is the biggest free-library
out of the city, yet its value is seriously
impaired by the encouragement it offers to
influenza germs and Bouquet de Bookworm.
This and various other suburban reading-
) rooms of the kind were established in the
days when the average municipal councillor
was but slightly informed, if informed at
all, as to the habits of the more popular
cocci, with the result that the air-circulating
arrangements were of a very free-and-diseasy
nature; and even nowadays the authorities
don’t seem to have the heart to upset the
dear old lack-of-system of grandma’s time.
“Sturt Street.” : One Clayton, living within
10 miles of Ballarat, was waited upon a
while ago by a gentle Chinaman. The soft-
spoken, sweet-smiling Asiatic wanted the job
of converting Clayton’s backyard into a
vegetable garden. Never did a man want a
job so badly. The price Sin Cat came down
to eventually was so absurdly low
that Clayton concluded it would be
flying in the face of Providence to
deny himself a superb kitchen garden.
So Sin Cat was set going. He rooted
out some weeds, and mapped a number
of beds, then went to work in a small
hole in the north-east corner of the
allotment. “Wha’for?” asked Clayton.
“Get plenty soil fill ’em up, makee
level,” said Sin Cat. Then suddenly
Sin Cat jacked it. Clayton noticed
that he was carrying away a far
larger bundle than he brought, and,
filled with suspicion, he insisted on an
inspection. He had to use force. Sin
Cat’s bundle was mainly bones —
human bones! A whole skeleton was
there. “My cousin,” said Sin Cat in
explanation. “Me takee home China.”
Clayton is positive that the bones must
have been buried for quite ' 40 years.
Now, who kept a tab on them? How had
Sin Cat contrived to just hit the spot?

“Copabella”: Conan Doyle never strung
together a better necklace of coincidences than
the Victorian C.I.D. did in a case recently
before a suburban court. Last Aprilan old shop-
keeper in Footscray was stuck-up by armed
robbers in his shop doorway. There was a
bit of gun-play by the local police, and one
of the robbers, a youth of 19, was cornered
and captured. Madden, C.J., let him off
with three months and a recommendation
that he should be kept from contamination.
A strong bid was made by the police to get
the name of the youth’s accomplice, but the
lad was “oyster,”* and did his term without
squeaking. About the end of August a Mel-
bourne electrician named How'ey opened by
mistake a letter addressed to one Davey, an
employee. To the similarity of name was
added the fact that the post-office date-
stamping machine had run a blurry line
across the “Davey,” disfiguring it. The
letter made Howey think. It invited the
recipient to get a few of the firm’s billheads
with its receipt stamp upon them, so that
the writer might fake a receipt for a motor.
It also asked for one or two 200-volt electric
lamps to help the writer on his way. The*
requests were made as a means of repaying,
the good offices of the writer in keeping
Davey out of something! Now, a key had
been broken in the lock of the firm’s base-
ment door, and as the letter referred to the
writer’s intention to use that door as a
means of getting the lamps should Davey
fail to procure them, the letter was handed
on to the police. The C.I.D. photographed
it and let it finish its journey. It
told its recipient to “destroy this and be
careful.” Davey did as he was asked—to be
confronted next morning with a 'tec. and
the photograph. The mysteries of the “third
degree” probably form the next chapter of
the story, but the succeeding one opened at
a house* in Footscray, where a quantity of
electric wire and fittings were found and the
just-released 19-year-old was roped in for
unlawful possession. The charge was failing
badly when the police played their ace in
the form of the photographed letter. A
rather staggered lawyer demanded the origi-
nal. known to be burnt. The police coun-
tered with the corpus and evidence of Davey.
now up as No. 2 in the armed-robbery
charge. Costs did his best with a tale of a
youth chastened and repentant after three
months in gaol, but Sherlock Holmes’s photo-
graphed letter was too circumstantially
damning, and the more-or-less chastened
went up for another sixer.

“Globe” : You’ll be glad to know that Bill-
jim no longer has to pay lid. per word for
wireless messages from hospital ships off the
Australian coast. He has been returning to
Australia, sick and wounded, for over two
years now. and at last it has been decided to
give him the rate charged to travelling
civilians, viz., 6d. Now, having persuaded
the Government to that much, can't we in-
duce it to let homecoming Billjim. sick or
wounded from the wars, send just one brief
message to his eagerly waiting people without
paying tribute to the Commonwealth? That
would mean he would pay 2d. a word, the
ship’s charge. The other 4d. goes now to the
Commonwealth. In the circumstances, can’t
we forego that?

A. C. Willis, general sec. of the Colliery
Employees’ Federation, last week advised the
miners “not to lose their heads.” Good ad-
vice in its way, but, seeing that they are
not allowed to use their heads at a ballot
beforehand, what strikers rbally need is a
leader who will advise them how to lose
their appetites.
Statistics of South Aus. for 1910 show
that the deaths in the central State were,
for no obvious reason, the highest since 1902

falling off in the number of marriages, yet
the rate (over eight per thousand) is the

second highest of all the States. The num-
ber of weddings in 1915 is reflected in last
year’s births; S.A. is the only State in
which there were more births than in the
previous year. Also, only one in 20 was
“irregular,” and that is the lowest propor-
tion during the present century. As
a side-line it is noted that vaccination for
smallpox is rapidly becoming extinct under
the law which makes it optional. Last year
only one parent in 20 opted for it.

Australia has produced another extra-
ordinarily young colonel —well-set-up Aubrev
Wiltshire, aged 25. Wiltshire left a job
in the Bank of Australasia to enlist, and
was a lootenant under Colonel R. A. Crouch,
whose place as C.O. he now fills. The young
man has the Military Cross and the Croix
de Guerre.

Private John Carroll, of Ivurrawang. His
was the crashing, smashing kind of valor.
He rushed a trench when the barrage lifted,
bayoneted four Germans, rescued a pal,
killed another Hun, pushed on, captured a
machine gun single-handed and made corpses
of the three handiest gunners. Then, being
slightly wounded, he took a spell. Before
enlisting he was a guard on the Kurrawang-
Kalgoorlie woodline.
t John B. Holme, permanent head of the
N. S. Wales Department of Labor and
Industry, who, when the time was ripe, sat
down with the “Defence” Committee and
kept at it till the railway and tramway
strike was settled, is an under-sec. who has
no use for either limelight or red-tape. This
is probably due to the fact that he wasn’t
brought up in the public service. He has
just the right training and temperament for
his job. A graduate in Arts and Laws of
Sydney TJni., he forsook the law to go farm-
ing, and when he wasn’t bailing up Straw-

berry he was soaking himself in Economics.
What he couldn’t read in English he read
in French or stumbled through in German.
It was Holman who, having sampled
him previously at Wyalong, when he
was practising there in the late ’9o’s,
persuaded him that his right place
was in the sub-department of Labor;
and when the Department of Labor and
was formed he was placed in
charge of it. He is a glutton for work and
facts, and, though once addicted to boxing
and boating, now has only one hobby—the
organisation of industry. A son of the Rev.
Thomas Holme, he was born in Footscray
(Yic.) 45 years ago, and went on to the
Uni. from King’s School, Parramatta. A
brother is on the Uni.’s teaching staff.
Monty Miller, aged 85, who recently got
six months in Sydney for being a member
of the 1.W.W., is said to be one of those
who were wounded in the Eureka fight. May
be; but nobody named Monty Miller figures
in Peter Lalor’s list of killed and wounded.
E. A. Huber, Clerk of Records in the House
of Reps., has cut his faint con-
nection with Germany by angli-
cising his name to Hubert.
There never was any doubt
about his character and loy-
alty, but his patronymic has
been a butt for super-patriots,
who have also made it the
basis for the most reckless sus-
picions. Hubert is the Aus-
tralian-born offspring of a
father who left Germany over
50 years ago and died in this
country about 10 years after-
wards. Hubert himself has
never been outside Yic. and has
the warm blood of an Irish
mother to sweeten any sauer-
krautish fluid in his veins. So
far as his job is concerned, he
is considered the safest refuge for flurried
Clerks of the House who have been blown
off their course by some storm that calls for
a wide knowledge of May.
James Millhinch Bickett has gone pros-
pecting in the undiscovered country, aged
92. Born in Scotland, he reached Vic. in
1848, and was among the first diggers at
Golden Point. After the Stockade revolt
he was associated in the Local Court, a
tribunal of the time, with Carboni Rafaello,
an insurgent leader acquitted of high treason
at the trial of the Eureka men in Melbourne.
Bickett was the State’s oldest J.P., a legal
manager, and one of the founders of nearly
every public institution in Ballarat.
From senior-constable to lieut.-colonel is
the record of plain Bill Smith, who, before
the Kaiser broke loose, bought remounts for
the Vic. police. On October 22, 1914, he
went away as Director of Remounts on the
staff of the late General Bridges, and was
promoted captain and provost-marshal in
Egypt. He was slightly wounded in Gal-
lipoli, is now with “Birdy” in France, and
has secured more than one “mention.” His
son, Lieut. W. Smith, who is being invalided
home, has also some mentions to his credit.
Smith senior, on a recent visit to London,
yarned with George R. about a previous
acquaintance, the remount officer having been
in charge of the royal nags during the Aus-
tralian visit of 1901.
Dead in Adelaide, at 79, George Wilcox,
a S. Australian for the last 60 years.
Wool and hides were his strong point. He
has been for over 20 years out of the busi-
ness which he founded, but his sons, with
Glen Legoe, carry it on in more than one
State.
One hot-footer of Richmond (Vic.), a
single man, enlisted away back in Feb., ’l5.
His married brother, going to see him off,
was so affected that he enlisted too. He
got into the same battalion after a while and
in the same company, and a few months ago
the same Hun shell caught them both. Last
week they returned by the same boat, but
both left mementoes in France, the single
one several fingers, the other a leg.
A. E. Hamilton, lately put at the hea 1
of the Military Pay-office in Adelaide, is
about as unlike a majah as a m jor can be.
But he is an experienced accountant, and
brings effective methods into a department
which was a jest until a commission did for
it what the hopeless Pearce should have
done years ago. Hamilton’s level Scotch
head has room for sporting ideas, too, and
he owns one or two useful racers.
Died last month, aged 90, Mrs. Margaret
Jane Caldecott, relict of Alfred Millwater
Caldecott, who was brought out by the first
Provincial Government of South Aus. as
shorthand writer. He afterwards transferred
to the Immigration Department of the first
Vic. Government. With others he joined in the
Fiji cotton boom, which brought financial
disaster upon several Melbourne investors.
Then he moved to Mauritius, and died dur-
ing a voyage from that colony. Mrs.
Caldecott at 17 married a shipowner, Capt.
Young, who was lost at sea a month later.
This was about the time of the Gold Rush of
the ’fifties, and the young widow, with a
companion, Miss Blake, decided to try her
luck in Victoria. The two girls made the
journey from Quebec to Melbourne, where
Mrs. Young got employment under the Gov-
ernment, and thus met her second fate. Miss
Blake, now married and 80 years of age, still
resides at Benalla.

The election of P. M. McGirr to the
N-S.W. Assembly adds to the list of Ma
State families with two or more members in
the same legislature. The first case on
record is the most remarkable. In the first
Peg. Council under responsible Government
(1856), 31 members were summoned to serve
for five years. Three of those called, Robert
Pitt Jenkins, William Pitt Faithfull and
James Robert Wilshire, were first cousins
the sons of three sisters (Esther, Sussana
and Jemima Pitt), who with their mother
and only brother. Thomas Matcham Pitt
emigrated hither in 1800. The Pitts were
cousins of Horatio Nelson, and all received
large grants of land for that reason. The
litts, Jenkinses, Faithfulls and Wilshires
took a useful and prominent part in the
p .arly development of the Ma State, and their
descendants still stick to the job.
A Ballarat pioneer who died the other
week was the father of the general sec. of
the Vic. P.L.C. Stewart, deceased, was 88
when he passed out. Although he was a
young miner on the. Ballarat field at the
time of the Eureka riot, he never persuaded
lnmself in later years that he had taken an
active part in it. He was strangely unim-
aginative on this point.
The book of Mrs. Hannah Page, of Wil-
liamstown (Vic.), was closely lately, and
local gossips noted that the old lady, who
arrived from Manchester in 1563, and mar-

voyage from Tasmania, had lived in one
street for 54 years.

A SONG OF UNNECESSARY SULPHUR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It is not to be expected that machine-made men
•of the Teutonic pattern should 'possess souls.”
'Weary were we of the feast and song,
Of jest and tale and wine and revel.
The days were blue and the nights were long,
And a cheerless wight was the old, grey Devil.
King of Evil and Lord of Shame,
He limped through the dark, by all men slighted;
His sceptre of blood and his crown of flame
Were pawned for a wrong that a swift hour
righted.
Often at break of the night he sighed,
M ith the world’s thin sins of a weary gleaning,
And longed again for the full red tide
That surged when Hell and himself had meaning.
For the clash of spears and the murder-cry
And the padded steps of the traitor's creeping—•
But the fields of earth were parched and dry,
\\ ith a dull sneak-thief for his best day’s reaping.
The world was merry and clean and fair,
And a sweetness moved where the lands held revel,
Til] a sudden war-blast smote the air
And a ripple of gladness touched the Devil.
•Guns to the front and men to bleed ;
Ai d the cold world held its breath in wonder
At the lust to slay and the murder deed
That reddened the earth in the battle thunder.
Hell with its flames gaped hot and wide
lor the souls condemned at their fateful dying;
And the sulphur roiled like a flowing tide
1\ itli a scud of hate on its hot crest flying.
Bui. the harvest failed. And the Devil stood
With an idle pitchfork to aid the burning:
For out of the fields of slaughter rude
There were none that took the Ilellward turning.
The Devil pulled at his blistered horn.
“Great Scott,” he cried, “with the whole pit
heated,
A cold-foot creeps to me night or morn,
But of proper guests I am robbed and cheated.
“Briton and Frenchman and Russian fall,
And the men of every Allied nation;
But they answer Gabriel’s skyward call
ho die for a world’s regeneration.
“Damn my hoof!” cried the Lord of 111,
“The world is loud with the noise and stenches!
Where are the comrades my partner Bill
Had promised to send from the German trenches?”
Gun to gun made its bellowing call,
And bomb to bomb in the fierce red revel;
But Germany hadn’t a soul at all
For the lonely Hell and the waiting Devil.
“Damn my hoof and my horns and tail;
And damn the King that I helped and trusted!”
And the Devil looked blue and thin and pale
As he sat on a cindered star disgusted.

fabric of a garment is
4 really the foundation
upon which it is built.
A doubtful quality of
cloth may look well enough at first,
but there is little satisfaction in
good looks if they do not last.
A better grade of fabric not only shows off style and
tailoring to better advantage, but makes an astonishing
difference in the wearing quality of the garment.

In 1906 the capital was £190,000 and the
reserves £100,422; total £290,422. Since
then £333,093 has been added to the reserves,
notwithstanding that a 10 p.c. dividend has
been maintained. There is nothing sordid
about that. Meantime, certainly, £310.000
of new capital lias been got in; but as
that also has had its little 10 p.c., it
doesn’t make the performance look any the
less fine from the shareholders’ point of
view. It hasn’t been done, however, without
incurring considerable liabilities. This table
shows the changes in the past 15 years:—
1902. 1912. 1916. 1917.
Deposits, etc. . £565,851 £1,764,141 £1,779,287 £1,671,702

Other assets .. 115,697 218,166 46,664 79,863
Still, the increase in the liabilities doesn’t
mean anything like it looks in the first
line; for though they are altogether
£1,123,684 more, note that Government
stocks and cash are also £941,246 jnore.
Advances, etc. —this includes merchandise
stock and shares in other cos.—have in-
creased by £886,000; but practically the
whole of it has been provided out of new
capital and undivided profits. That, of
course, doesn't make the advances any the
less liable to depreciation. But the pastoral
finance co.’s commonest danger is not so
much depreciation of securities as having to
realise in a time of drought or low prices in
order to pay oft' a howling pack of anxious
depositors and other creditors. Thanks
largely, no doubt, to the war prices of the
past two years the co. was never so strong
financially as it is to-day ; for not only has
this exceptional market put money into the
pocket of the co., but it has put very many
of its clients in the happy position of not
wanting an uncle. Nine times out of 10
when pastoralists were making such profits
there would be a more or less wild rush to
buy runs at prices to correspond; and cos.
such as this would do most of the financing.
This is the 10th time; for even if there was
a disposition to plunge, which there isn’t,
banks and mortgage cos. would turn the cold
eyfe upon the enthusiast. So, though profits
are not going to continue on the present
scale, it seems to be certain that the co.. for
once in a way, is not increasing its risks
with its profits. They come, in short, not
from the finance side of the business, but
from the commission side —including agen-
cies, of which this co. has some very well
worth having.
The Federal Mutual Insurance Co. of
Australia (Sydney), which began with
£4039 of its capital eaten up by flotation
expenses:—•
Towards

1917.. 3965 8 „ „ 3099 866 9919
This co. was promoted by a man who knew
the business and had climbed high enough
in it to be N. 8. Wales manager of one of
the big English fire offices. But as a good
Australian lie was not content to see profits
going out of a country that badly needs all
the capital it can retain; so he threw up
his job and founded this co., and did it on
sound lines. Most young insurance cos.
make the mistake of buying big business
figures at a very heavy price, and, instead
of reckoning the cost as working exes.,
charge more or less of it against capital and
include this among their assets, calling if
“Business extension account" or something
of the sort. There is no such visionary
entry in this co.’s balance sheet. On the
contrary, even the preliminary exes, were
paid off out of profit as soon as that profit
was made. The result, is a remarkably
“clean” balance sheet and one of which any
young office might \ r ery well be proud.
Naturally in these circumstances the ex-
pense rate is rather high, yet not so high as
not to leave generally a fair margin of
underwriting profit:—
Net Expense Lost
Premiums. Expenses. Losses. Rate. Rate.
1915. . £25,520 £13,303 £9,636 52.1 p.o. 37.8 p.c.
1916.. 32,303 14,981 12,292 46.4 p.c. 38.1 p.c.
1917.. 35,356 17,942 15,508 50.7 p.c. 43.9 p.c.
For the past year the margin is down to
5.4 p.c. of the net premiums; but it was a
bad year from the insurance point of view
because of the heavy losses on hailstorm
risks in the N. S. Wales wheat-cocky dis-
tricts and the large number of losses through
fire-bugs in Sydney. Even so, with £2012
earned by investments, there was £866 to go
to unearned premium reserve after paying
the 8 p.c. dividend. It isn't as much to put
by as this paper would like to see; never-
theless the financial position remains quite
satisfactory. The net premiums for the 12
months amounted to £35,356. It is reckoned
that 40 p.c. of the year’s premiums should
cover an office’s unexpired risks, so that say
£14,100 should cover the Federal’s losses
—and, as against that the co. has £48,056 in
capital and reserves. The other factor is
the nature of the investments. Public secu-
rities and cash run to £17,206; and probably
there is some cash also in “sundry debtors
and agency balances, £8083.” Mortgages
account for £23,056. The other items are
negligible. And behind that, for the further
protection of policy-holders, there is £116,212
for which shareholders have made themselves
liable. One cannot say positively, of course,
what the future of any insurance co. will
be; but once a concern of the kind has
finished teething, there are few businesses
that show better returns. The heavy mor-
tality is in the cos.’ early years, and that
is mostly due to causes which this office has
studiously avoided. On all present appear-
ances it looks as though it has come to stay
and prosper.

This co. now does almost exclusively a com-
mission business: advances and all other
book debts on June 30 were only £47,717, and
even that is more than they were at either
of the previous two balances. One result
is that, notwithstanding a large investment
in recent years in a city freehold —freeholds
now stand at £125,874 —and notwithstanding
the co. has in cash and public securities
£42,632. the total of its liabilities is only
£33,856. It is very rarely indeed that a co.
handling pastoral products is able to show
such unimpeachable security for its capital.
Or. put in another way. it isn’t often that a
co. in this line has been able to build up and
hold so fine a business without drifting
much deeper into dubious pastoral-finance
transactions. No doubt conditions have
helped of recent years. Even so this record
of profit from a business conducted on these
lines is very admirable. To a great extent
it is due to the co.’s big hold on the fat-stock-
market. During the past two years the co.’s
yardings have been :
1915-6. 1916-7.
Cattle . . 148,864 149,457
Sheep .. 2,327,633 1,703,663
Though the turnover in sheep has been less,
prices (and consequently commissions) have
been higher; and there has been a nice bit of
extra commission, too, in the increase in the
average price of wool from £l5 2s. 4d. to
£l9 18s. Id. per bale. Whether any and
if so what provision has been made for such
contingencies as a retrospective war tax is
not visible from the published accounts.
“Rates and taxes, depreciation and all other
charges” are included in the one item of ex-
penses. which have increased from £38.058 in
the year ended June 30, 1914, to £43.670 in
the past year.
The next comparison shows the movement
of various balance-sheet items:—
1900. 1910. 1916. 1917
Overdrafts. . . . £55,741 £ 17,311 £20,162 £25 994

lii the past 10 years £70,000 of profit has
been capitalised, say £35.000 lias been added
to reserves, and the dubious advances with
which the eo. was encumbered for many
years have been written down and liquidated.
And that on a share capital which stood at
£50,000 only 10 years ago. Plainly it isn't
money that has done it: it is men. So the
question for the future is whether as good
men will always be available.

This co. has been getting it both ways—out
of the military trade and out of the civilian
trade through the Protection which the U
boats have been giving the overseas manu-
facturer. Out of the extra profit the State
has been taking its bite. Rates and taxes
were formerly lumped with “interest, dis-
count, salaries and general exes.,” and in
the year to the end of July, 1914, the lot
amounted to £10,144. In the past year in-
terest, discount, salaries and general exes,
were £6306. Assuming that they were £5OOO
in 1914, the increase in taxation has been
from £5144 to £12,886. This is a case in
which the assessment of war profits is exceed-
ingly difficult. How much of the extra profit
which the co. has unquestionably made has
been due to the increase in trade through
the substitution of Maoriland for foreign
goods? Suppose Mcßrown previously bought
a foreign tweed and this co. made 10s. profit
by supplying him last year with good home-
grown, home-made material, is there any
sense in taxing this co. on the extra 10s.
that it made? Haven’t we been wanting the
local manufacturer to get Mcßrown’s cus-
tom all along? But if, because of the war
and the U boats, this or any other co. added
30 or 20 p.c. to its prices and that much was
extra profit, then it is a fair thing that the
co. should disgorge the greater part of it.
The proposition seems to be one that cannot
be tackled in detail by an Act of Parliament.
The most that an Act can do equitably is to
lay down a few general rules and leave the
rest to taxation commissioners. That enor-
mous profits have been made through the
war is. certain —by shipowners and graziers
and miners. And it is a monstrous thing
that that war profit should escape taxation
because of the difficulty of the problem.
r Thif c°- has not increased its capital of
£115,350 since the war started ; nevertheless
it has been able to spend about £12.500 on
plant, etc., pay its 13 p.c. dividend and put
by over £38,000: —

Probably, however, the whole £38.088 added
to more or less liquid assets (including
stock) is not all surplus profit, because the
£12,500 spent on additional plant, etc., may
not have entirely covered the wear and tear
of the past three vigorous years. At any
rate, the book value is now nearly £BOOO
less than it was three years ago, in spite of
the additions. Liabilities are still heavy, but
that is largely due to the increase in stocks
lhe latter, however, look fairly safe, because
there is not likely to be any very sudden fall
in prices when peace comes. For one thing
shipping will be scarce for some time after-
wards, whereas the demand for civilian
clothes will be pretty extensive when Bill-
jim pomes home —especially if his deferred
pay is handed out promptly.

It isn’t much use trying to find out what
profit is actually made in any one half-year
For instance, this co., like all the other bi"
ones at Broken Hill bar the Sulphide Corp S
sells its concentrates to the Associated
Smelters, in which it is a partner. The
smelter co. isn’t a speculator in metals or
extractions; so it fixes what it regards as
safe prices for metals and makes an advance
cf 90 p.c. During the last couple of half-
years lead has been valued at £25 and silver
at 2s. So the North’s revenue last half was
made up of (1) 90 p.c. of the value of the
deliveries of silver and lead, silver being
taken at 2s. and lead at £25; (2) the sur-
pluses realised on the previous half-year’s
deliveries; (3) proceeds of sales of zinc
tailings to De Bavay’s. Big surpluses must
have been received on the previous half-vear’s
deliveries. Actually lead started at £3O and
has stood there or thereabouts ever since,
while silver (standard) lias steadily pushed
up from 3s. 04d. (average for January) to
4s. 14d. (present value). The current half-
year will be cut into by the strike, the
Broken Hill and some of the Port Pirie men
having decided that it will help the Rand-
wick and Eveleigh workshop employees to re-
sist the purely supposititious perils of a card
system by depriving Billjim of munitions in
France and Palestine. But the longer these
men knock off. work the higher the prices
will go and the bigger the surpluses which
the cos. will realise: so the cos. won’t be
punished to any serious extent.
There is another way of finding out
approximately what profit a mining co.
which has got into its stride is making. Look
at these figures:—

Liabilities.. .. 29,390 263,556 261,669
Surplus .. £211,225 £442,285 £501,483
11 1 the past three years the co. has thus
banked up £290.200 besides putting aside
£41.307 to satisfy income-tax. In the past
yeur alone the accumulation has been
£108,330. This is after providing the divi-
dends and paying for all new mine and mill
plant and mine development. The outlay
on plant has not, however, been very great
during the last three years—somewhere about
£lO.OOO. Dividends have amounted to
£510,000, which is 34 times the total capital
as it stood at the date when the first table
opens. Go back 20 years and a comparison
between the figures of those days the
present reads like a romance. The North
was one of the mines worked from the very
earliest days; Zeb Lane, who afterwards
made an accidental splash in Westralia. was
its manager. But because the Germans
hadn’t solved the sulphide problem for us.
the North was for all practical purposes
abandoned, and Hal Sheppard and h ls
friends bought it for a thousand or two. The
paid capital 20 years ago was £lO.OOO m

AUSTRALIAN ELECTRIC STEEL LTD.,“it
100,000 shares paid to 2s. Only 12 years ago
the surplus of assets apart from the mine
was under £5OOO. No new capital has been
got in since then, though there have been
plenty of waterings. Five'years ago, when
the Bailliens had got more say, the capital
was increased from £200,000 to £OOO,OOO by
the simple process of writing up assets.
Since then the assets have so far justified
the writing up that they have paid £840,000
in dividends; and probably a couple of hun-
dred thousands have been made and not
divided.
As to the future? The war, of course,
has given the co. some extra profits. Still,
we haven’t been able to do much
with our zincs, and the half-year immedi-
ately prior to the war showed a larger profit
than any subsequent period. Certainly
1.16.020 tons ore was handled then as
against 111.290 tons last half-year. Taking
the average at 130,000 tons per half-year
there is enough ore proved in the mine to
last something over 10 years. The divided
profit has of recent years averaged about
18s. per ton. But it would be dangerous to
value the 2,750,000 tons of proved ore on
that basis. What basis is safe this paper
doesn’t know. Over a long run of years
13s. 4d. has been realised; and there seems
no reason why the future should do w 7 orse.
That means £1,830,000 for the ore above the
1400 ft. level ; and during the past half the
main shaft has been sunk to 1539 ft., with a
view to presently finding out what is at
1550 ft. Add to the proved ore in the mine
the possibilities and the half-million of
liquid assets; and then reckon that the profit
from the proved ore won’t all be in hand for
10 years or so. There are 600,000 shares.
Silver (standard) has passed 4s. again : it
is at a higher point than at any period since
the great discoveries of the Hand and West-
ralia poured so much gold into the world
that the bimetallists’ old dream of making
silver legal tender along with gold, at a fixed
ratio, seemed to have vanished for all time.
But the world hasn’t been the same old
world during the past three years. There
has in the past been a vague notion, with
nothing much to support it, that £lOO of new
gold could sustain from £5OO to £7OO of new
credit. But with little more than
£100,000.000 of new gold coming into the
world per annum, credits have been growing
at the rate of at least £10,000.000,000;
and the voice of the silver-man is
heard again saying that his metal
must come to the rescue. To some
extent it is coming to the rescue: silver
is being poured out of the American mints,
and the Australian mints are not idle, either.
Meantime, the silver-using countries of Asia
—Japan in particular—are flourishing as
they never flourished before; and they are
taking large quantities of the white metal.
Hence the rise of nearly a shilling during the
past year. That something of the sort was
coming this column made more or less of a
pot-shot at predicting many months ago.

From the other Pacific Coast: —
Ocean Oil Co., of Brisbane, has had its annual
report published in London and Los Angeles
(U.S.A.), though the Melbourne and Sydney papers
do not seem to have received a copy. Because of the
seerecv observed by Tom Whaley, the Californian
driller who bored for the Queensland co. near King-
ston (S.A.), very little has ever leaked out in Aus-
tralia about his work. It is now alleged that he
made some remarkable discoveries before the capital
of the co. became exhausted. Whaley’s report states
that every indication encourages boring to a greater
depth. The discovery of traces of oil and paraffin-
wax in the oil sands passed through proved to him
that it was only necessary to go deeper to get oil.
At 730 ft. the first bed of oil sands was encountered,
and it showed traces of heavy mineral oil. The
amount of paraffin-wax was equal to 5.61 b. to the
ton. At 1008 ft. more sand was traversed which
showed a residue of one-third grain of wax in 1750
grains of sand. At 1100 ft. two samples of a con-
glomerate' of blue shale and sandstone gave lOoz.
and 80oz. of pure wax to the ton. It is a pity that
the Ocean Oil Co. has not published the log of its
bore, and it is clearly up to the Minister of Mines
in South Aus. to insist upon this valuable informa-
tion being made public.
* * * *
This page -went to sleep the other day
and referred to Amalgamated Wireless’s
£7OOO dividend for the half-year (none was
paid in the previous half) as equal to z-s p.c.
for the year. Of course, the capital being
£140.000' the distribution is equal to 5 p.c.
for the year —the same as in the previous
twelve months.

On account of the stoppage of the railway
service, the Carpathia’s battery at Bai mod-
man (N.S.W.) was soon without feed, so all
but four men had to be put off the mine at
Ardlethan. And that just as a dividend was
showing up over the horizon, too.
“Jaeko”: The inspired growl about the
bad treatment of the local molybdenite pro-
ducer, and the accompanying threat that
“with nothing more than the advance re-
cently offered (16 p.c.) the low-grade pro-
positions must remain unworked and tne
metals so necessary at the present time will
not bo procured from that soui’ce,” are in
pretty contrast to the joyous language of
the company-promoter. Recent prospectuses
yelled of the fortunes under a few feet of
dirt, gainable even if the recent quotations
fell, and marvelled at the indifference of the
public. In view of these conflicting state-
ments, the public may presently begin to
suspect that co. floaters are optimists!
* * . * *
The copper gougers at Phillips River
(W.A.) lately got a statement of the State
smelters’ third campaign—in the earlier
part of last year. They don’t seem to be
much the wiser for it. The works are rented
by the Government, which pays the owner
2s. per ton on all ore treated. The state-
ment seems to have got the buyers tangled
because special charges made against par-
ticular sellers are included with the out-
goings, as of course they should be, presum-
ing that they have been deducted from the
payments made to these particular ore-
suppliers. That should be made clearer.
The only other point which needs clearing
up is with regard to a very small item —
“Charges on parcels under 5 tons, £ll 11s.”
As The Bulletin understands it, any cus-
tomer who can’t send in five tons or more is
fined £1 Is.; anu how that comes to figure
among the outgoings this oaper can’t under-
stand. For the rest the statement seems
straightforward enough. The works treated
3385 tons ore, containing 216 tons copper,
20280 z. gold and 131 oz. silver. The gougers
netted £17.083. Or put it this way: they
netted £4 per oz. for their gold and £4l 10s.
per ton for their copper. The gross pro-
ceeds of the sales of metal were £39,694.
This was absorbed as follows: Smelting and
realisation charges, £18,415 (= £B5 ss. per
ton copper) ; concentrating and other
charges, including freight, interest and rent
(£323), £4199; balance available for sup-
pliers, £17,080, after writing off £668 of
preliminary exes. The whole concern is
under the management of Richard Shepherd,
who has had as much experience of smelting
—first at Broken Hill and afterwards at
Mt. Morgan and elsewhere —as almost any
man in Australia.
Someone lias roused Tom Duff and co.’s
ire by alleging that the new shoot in the
Edna May Deeps is going into the Central.
The drive on the reef is described in official
reports as north-east, and unless this infor-
mation is designed to hoodwink and mislead,
the workings must, it is declared, be in the
direction of the Central. An equally interest-
ing point is whether it will continue high
grade or not. This is of importance to both the
Central and Deeps: to the Central because,
if high values continue across the boundary,
a boom in share values is assured, and to the
Deeps because the longer and stronger the
shoot is the worse it will be for the bears,
judging by the way the Edna May shoot
has kept parallel with the Central boundary
in the upper levels, there is no reason for
believing that it is going to pass out of
Deeps at the present bottom level; but the
ore is so close to the boundary at that point,
and the shoot is so strong and rich, that
there doesn’t seem to be any reason why it
shouldn’t continue well into the Central. It
is not a case of the Central wanting to pick
the Deeps’ pocket, as some of the latter’s
barrackers imagine. It is only hopeful of
being able to line its own before long.

Costs include development. On that basis
there is £5OOO profit for the half-year. This
can’t mean fat divs. on a 60,000 register.
Faith rests on No. 4 level opening up ore
reserves in the south reef and in the Edna
Consolidated middle reef. There isn’t much
in this to boost shares on; but with the
market flourishing on Westonia pap, any-
thing may happen. The mine record to date
is 77,000 tons milled for £114,000 worth of
gold, of which shareholders have got £9OOO.
* * * *
Mount Rankin is a Southern Cross
(W.A.) show picked out by Alec Mac-
George in the days of the Edna May boom
as a low-ferade proposition that needed
£lO,OOO to give it a start. The syndicate
didn’t then fructify, so the mine went to
one McGuinness, who by the*use of elbow-
grease and a deft tongue afterwards got
permission to float an £lB,OOO co. in 10s.
shares. After six months’ work under J.
H. Franks, 12,000 tons of ore are blocked
out on four sides between Nos. 1 and 2
shafts. The grade is from 21s. to 255. per
ton. Better stone was got in No. 3 shaft
till buck quartz knocked values out. Franks
is driving here, but has still to connect up
with his other two shafts. That done, he
works out that he will have 60,000 tons for
the battery whenever cash is available for
plant. His idea is to shove No. 2 shaft
down to get water and to see if anything
better lies underfoot. It is a good pro-
gramme. . Any other would most likely mean
that the concern would be kept going indefi-
nitely, with the help of occasional calls, for
the benefit only of the wages man and the
machinery merchant.
David Currie, of Lake and Currie, who
took over the Briseis for John Bull from
Bill Allen and A. E. Langford, has been in-
vited into the Board room. That’s better.
With Lindesay Clark at the mine it was ex-
travagance to pay a consulting engineer fees
in London ; albeit Currie has been useful in
the hunt after new properties. Briseis profit
in 1916 was £32,517 against £20,007 in
1915, all made with tin at about £l7O. This
current year the co. started with a reserve
of £50,000 intact and cash assets of £26,829
to set against sundry creditors £5441. Since
January tin has gone up from £lB6 to £246,
so that profits have accumulated in the face
of the bill for switching the Ringarooma
River to safety behind the Krushka fiat open-
cut. Once the big Ringarooma Hill is gone
Lindesay Clark will have six million yards
of drift to draw on, with estimated tin con-
tents of 3845 tons oxide. There are worse
mining possibilities when the world wants
tin.

Wallaroo and Moonta wound up on June
30 with surplus assets £248,341, after paying
three divs. of 2s. 6d. each, the lot amount-
ing to £60,000. This looks poor against the
surplus of £345,346 on .Tune 30, 1916, but
the comparison is better than appears. Thus,
after paying the divs., total assets were
£445,628 against £383,017, made up on these
lines: —•
June, 1916. June, 1917.
Cash items and war loan .. £70,441 £157,480
Copper in stock or transit . . 160,431 132,894

Stores, fuel, etc. .. .. 99,058 130,365
Sundry debtors .. .. 18,377 2,309
Liabilities a year ago were £37,671. On the
same basis they would be £41,287 this year;
but co. drags into the liabilities £156,000 as
a provision for contingencies. In other
words the co. put by that much as a fit and
proper contribution to war taxation because
of the w 7 ar price for copper. Bigjohn For-
rest’s Bill may, however, prevent the co.
doing its duty. In that case either the State
will start smelling around or the fund will
be made available for general purposes.
Underground better ore has made at 2910 ft.
off Taylor’s shaft at the Wallaroo. In the
Harnley mine, Moonta, the zone of low-grade
stuff has been left behind. Otherwise the
stuff hauled is of the old 3 p.c. grade.

Clans McLeod and McKenzie, supported
by other kiltless Celts in Madden and
Meehan, are the largest producers of wol-
fram in Tasmania. As the owners of the
Story's Creek property they started off the
mark to develop with the war to help them.
A year ago their 100-ton-a-day mill began
on ore from Nos. 1 and 2 lodes, with a width
varying from 2ft. to 6ft. Running one shift
7300 tons have been treated for 133 tons
concentrate, roughly half wolframite and
half cassiterite. When chief McLeod went
north and south to gather bawbees to help
buy “The Creek,” Tassy’s mining folks were
full-handed; but the neighboring clan
McKenzie came to the rescue with the neces-
sary reinforcements, and noo a’ the profits
remain in the claelian. The mine, which is
away up on Ben Lomond, is said to have
several years’ ore proved.

General-manager Sticht assures Mount
Lyell that Read-Rosebery ore is adapted for
treatment by the electrolytic process. That,
of course, is from the technical side ; it will
still be for the market value of zinc and lead
—zinc especially—to determine whether the
complex proposition is to hand out divi-
dends. The future of zinc is very uncertain.
It is all a question of the world’s powers of
absorption. Without a doubt a tremendously
increased supply will be available. While
the U.S.A. has almost doubled its plants,
Japan is making very rapid strides, and
Burma is becoming known as a zinc coun-
try. And Broken Hill, with its enormous
output of zinc tailings, is a competitor with
Read-Rosebery.

Westralian Mines Department is now look-
ing for someone to take the broken-down
Santa Claus mine and plant off its hands.
Years ago a Perth co. tried, and failed, to
make monev out of it, and later another co.
also died in debt. This, however, did not
prevent an ill-informed Mines Department
from advancing a Kalgoorlie syndicate a
thousand or two to work it, nor the Water
Supply Department from spending a bigger
sum of money on a water-supply which no
one appears to have ever used.
* * « *
Westralian Chamber of Mines, acting on
behalf of Kalgoorlie and other mineowners,
has induced the British authorities to allow
the shipment and use of more powerful
explosives. Some time ago general dissatis-
faction was expressed at the poor class of
fracteur that was being sent here, and a
request was made by the Chamber that the
composition be 80 p.c. gelignite containing
50 p.c. nitro glychrine, and 20 p.c. standard
gelignite containing 61 p,e. of nitro glycer-
ine. The Chamber’s request was granted
except that gelatine dynamite is being em-
ployed instead of standard gelignite. The
former is really a more powerful explosive
than the mineowners in the West require.

GAS IN THE STOMACH IS
DANGEROUS.
PHYSICIANS RECOMMEND THE USE
OF MAGNESIA.
Sufferers from indigestion or dyspepsia
should remember that the presence of gas or
wind in the stomach invariably indicates that
the stomach is troubled by excessive acidity.
This acid causes the food to ferment and
the fermenting food in turn gives rise to
noxious gases which distend the stomach,
hamper the normal functions of vital inter-
nal organs, cause acute headaches, interfere
with the action of the heart, and charge the
blood stream with deadly poisons, which in
time must. ruin the health. Physicians say
that to quickly dispel a dangerous accumula-
tion of wind in the stomach and to stop the
food fermentation which creates the gas, the
acid in the stomach must be neutralised, and
that for this purpose there is nothing quite
so good as half a teaspoonful of bi&urated
magnesia taken in a little water immediately
after meals. This instantly neutralises the
acid, thus stopping fermentation and the for-
mation of gas, and enables the inflamed, dis-
tended stomach to proceed with its work
under natural conditions. Bisurated mag-
nesia is obtainable in powder or tablet form
Irom any chemist; but as there are many
different forms of magnesia it is important
that the bisurated which the physicians
prescribe should be distinctly asked for. —

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, September 10, 1917.
My Dear Arini, —
There’s a Michigan Uni. Professor of
Oratory resting here for a few weeks. With
his wife he’s on a year’s tour. Truebloou’s
his Cromwellian name, and he is large and
impressive, with a Quaker like softness of
manner. He moves with the dignity of a
continent and brings a wad of letters of
introduction. One is from ex-President Taft.
Of Michigan Uni. he says: “There are
SOOO students. Of that number about 1200
are women. It’s the first State-subsidised
University, and a youngster—it started in
1837—compared with Yale and Harvard,
which date back about 300 years.” Uncle
Sam puts sb much stress on oratory and its
near relatives, extempore debate and logic,
that Michigan devotes a chair to the sub-
ject. “Every seventh or Sabbatical year my
leave comes along. Last time I took it
early, and in 1912 was in Germany, amongst
other places. To Americans it was extra-
ordinary to see so many old men, women and
children gathering the harvest. When one
asked, “Where are all your young and
middle-aged men?” they replied: “Most busy
■ —drilling!” There’s honeyed sweetness in
the Michigan man’s postscript. “Well— we
are drilling, too.”
The big prof, wants to do something. As
he moves through Australia and Maoriland
he is eager to give Shakspearean recitals for
the Red Cross.
Killara fete day came in with a crash of
thunder and blew out in a wild westerly
gale. Yet thei'e’ll be a good deal over £2OOO
for the War Chest. A strike-time train ser-
vice made the trip a fine sample of Rugby
scrum.
Arrived at Killara the goffer goffed, with
Appy ’Ampstead roped off the sacred greens.
The westerly blew down a tent here and
there, and tore the feminine hat up by the
roots. Otherwise the damage was slight,
except to the patience of thirsty souls, who
formed long queues outside quite inadequate
tea-tents. Mrs. Maschwitz, in mourning for
a. son killed in Prance, stuck to her post,
with Mrs. J. E. Donohue at the ’baccy stall.
The Killara produce dames—Mrs. Budden
and Mrs. Perdriau to the fore—had their
roof blown off, but the day was cool and the
trussed fowl and pound o’ chops kept condi-
tion. Warrawee tent had Mrs. Percy Hardy
and her mates to sell groceries and look after
kitchenware. Roseville modestly sold towels
1 Mrs. Archbold in charge. Chatswood got
into the hand-me-down business—Mrs. Read
and friends here advanced for orders. Pym-
ble tried the miracle of loaves and tea-
leaves—Mrs. Buck and Mrs. Crossing as the
chief conspirators—on the multitude who
charged the vittles with the hunger born of
an adventurous journey. In the evening
John Brownlow was hon. concert manager
of a good musical show in the Golf House.
In a letter to a Sydney friend Mary
Strickland chats of ancient Malta, w’here the
delicate mother is now well enough to be
wheeled about in the garden. “Lord and
Lady Methuen lent us their wing in the
Palace, and moved out. Our house, Villa
, is just over the way, and we can go
over and watch the workmen complete the
alterations before it is ready for us We
can. hardly realise we are so far from Aus-
tralia and long to hear all the latest news.”
Goldie-locks is trying to add Maltese to her
stock of foreign tongues; but as its ety-
mology goes back to the days of the Phoeni-
cians it is hard to grip. “We had an
annual agricultural show,’ very tiny after
Sydney’s Easter carnival. They tether the
animals under trees in a little wood, and
there were _ some splendid plough-horses....
It's so quaint to watch the treading out of
the corn—an ox and a donkey or a horse
and a mule yoked together. We have also
been to a race-meeting! The animals run
uphill {that's the test in Malta), and the
riders sit bareback. Lady Methuen gave
away the prizes—great banners, which the
country people carry off with much pride,
and usually give to their village church. It
was all very picturesque, and there must
have been about 30,000 spectators.”
The Holman family on their way from
Here to There crossed the blue Medi-
terranean in a fast battle-cruiser, which
landed them in Italy, where they progressed
overland through France to Britain and
dinings-out.
Heber McMahon, grandson of the late
Macquarie Bond McMahon, who joined an
Irish regiment ’way back in the Big Tur-
moil’s early stages, has now a third star on
his cuff —he’s chemical adviser to an army
corps and boss of high explosives. A brother
is a captain in the Irish Guards. The
mother of the two boys stands by on English
soil.
Melba slipped through Sydney so quietly
that only a few pressmen and a little group
who hung round the wharf to see her off
had speech with her. John Lemmone oiled
the wheels. Our Sovereign Voice, with
her youthful mate, Lady Susan Fitz-
clarence, rumbled over tiie border in a
reserved carriage. They found, what many
less pampered travellers discovered long
since, that it doesn’t mean sudden death to
have no sleeper on the Melbourne express.
A “stretch out” on a seat isn’t a bad substi-
tute.
“Wenty” Bucknell—-officially Lieut. Wil-
liam Wentworth Bucknell. of the Field
Artillery—was killed in France the other
week. He was the eldest son of the well-
known Quambone station owner, and a fine
sample of young Australian manhood.
There’s a nice girl—one of the Ivatt family
beyond Bathurst—in tears.
After a blizzard of presentations, includ-
ing a diamond boomerang, Dorothy Brunton
is now really and truly packing up for the
U.S.A.
Now a bomb has fallen out of the Post
Office among the Comforts dames. Even
before the Christmas mail starts to pour in,
900 tons of mail matter has banked up in
Australia, and the Post Office doesn’t see a
hope of getting it away for months and
months. Such things are so severely cen-
sored, otherwise the public wouldn’t be sur-
prised to know that practically the only mail
route open now is via America; and that is
almost impossible for parcels. P.M.G. Web-
ster can’t see any other way out —wherever
possible, send money to England and have
the goods forwarded from there. One thing,
however, we ouvht to send, no matter what
else is crowded out. Socks! There’ll be
dreadful suffering and loss from trench feet
if we can’t keep that service going through
the winter.
Young Fitzhardinge, a schoolboy who died
a few days ago, following on a side-
car accident, was a grandson of Dr. Clubbe,
the children’s specialist. But no skill could
save the little sufferer, who lingered only a
few hours.
Next week the
Royal Art Society
will hold its an-
nual show. If in
its 38 years it has
often been too
kind and given
space when it
might have shown
the way to the
door, here is the
man who doesn’t
mind shouldering
some of the blame.
For 20 years presi-
dent of the Society,
W. Lister Lister is
an incurable opti-
mist who can see
a glad to-morrow
for even wooden-
heads in an art class. Over his studio
should be written, “Abound in hope all ye
who enter here.” Most genial of mentors,
he tempers the bleak wind of criticism year
in, year out, to the lambs.
Born in Sydney, a son of John Armitage
Lister, of Brunteliff, Yorkshire, he went to
England as a youngster when the family
packed up for the other side. Educated at
the Bedford Schools and at Pont St. Max-
ence (France), W. L. Lister was an exhibi-
tor at the Royal Scottish Academy at 17
and at Manchester and other English gal-
leries before he bought his first razor. But
Australia called, and he humped his color-
box back to his native land before rapping
at the door of the Royal Academy. And
here he has taken root. Addicted to expanses
of creamy, sand, with meditative seagull
in attendance, and big bush canvases with
giant gums glinting in a gorgeous sunset,
his. work hangs in our National Gallery, of
which he is now one of the trustees, and
in the galleries of Adelaide, Maoriland and
Geelong. Winner of the prize offered for
the best picture of the Federal Capital site,
and a prolific painter (his annual bill for
frames must be a heavy tax on his modest
profits), Lister is one of this city’s most
persistent helpers of lame pups over the art-
stile.
Mrs. George Black, after putting up a
brave fight, has been carried home from a
private hospital. Yet she’s still concerned
about the finishing of some War Chest work
before the Call comes.
One of the Makinson boys, a lieut., was
wed in London lately. He gave his arm to a
Sydney girl, Mary Gibbes, who has been
pegging away at war work on the other side.
Ciceley Hughes, younger daughter of
the late John, M.L.C., has accepted a dia-
mond keepsake from Major Curtin, of the
Army Medical Corps.
The spiders will soon get a move on _at
deserted Cranbrook. The roomy mansion
which languishes under the forlorn title, “ex-
Government House for State Governors,” is
to be lent for a double-banked party on Sep-
tember 21. The afternoon will be for juven-
iles to frolic as they list in the sunny gar-
den. At nightfall the flapper will dance
with whom she can —grandpa is not excluded
—and the chaperons will play bridge up-
stairs. Funds to the War Chest.
The R.A.S. presi-
dent is Joyful over
Muir Auld’s progress
in oils. “He’s found
a market in Tiie
Bulletin for black-
so it’s
been au revoir to
pot-boiling. Hence his
best record at this
1917 exhibition.” The
son of a Scotchby-
terian parson who
used to expound the
W ord at Ashfield,
young Auld studied
awhile with J. S.
Watkins. Then to
London, where be-
tween drinking in the
best in the famous
art galleries he contributed sketches to the
Windsor, London Opinion and other mags.
The Adelaide gallery and our own National
temple hang some of his efforts in oils.
It was a very quiet knot-tying at Hamil-
ton when Myra Shelley was handed iby
her father to Ernest Philip Collins, of Can-
delo. Mrs. Trefle gave niece Myra her
foamy bridal gown of lily-white drapery
and gossamer lace. One of the Shelley boys
was lately killed at the Front, so there was
only a small gathering in the parental nest
after the ceremony.
The Symphony Orchestra—conductors Joe
Bradley and Slapoffski—shook the Conserva-
torium rafters the other afternoon. After a
Debussy Prelude, Ella Caspers appeared in
a pink frock with Hugo’s ballad, “La Fiancee
du Timbalier,” set to music by Saint-Saens.
To the Wars,” warbled Ella, who got some
sweet peas and daffodils for her pains—“to
the murd’rous combat appalling.” An inter-
val of ten minutes gave the Highbrows time
to get into a suitable frame of mind for the
big symphony in C Minor. Glazounoff was
the composer, if that's any comfort to you.
The horrible cruelties of this war! Soon
after it started “Tim” Henderson, a Manly
boy, was married to Vi Robey, of the family
that has been associated with the Village
nearly all its days. Then Tim went off to
do his bit; and his little wife left for the
other side to be as near as she could get. A
few weeks ago Tim was sent back to Aus-
tralia with an eye and a limb missing. His
wife had to stay behind—she couldn’t get a
passport, and she couldn’t have travelled
then even if the leave was given. Now-
trouble heaped upon trouble —word comes
that the baby is dead.
Perth sassiety, with Mrs. D. G. Gawler
and Mrs. H. Hill in the van, runs an every-
Wednesday luncheon and tea-room, which
nets about £BO a month for trench comforts.
Nicholson and Co. lend a gorgeous show-
room, and Mrs. Frank Davis provides a
musical programme to help down the cold
beef and salad and afternoon-tea. All the
prettiest girls, dressed a la Hollandaise, float
round with trays and things.
Cyril Monk’s home at Mosman has vocal
music to rival daddy’s fiddle, for a very new
lifts up her voice at morn and eve.
(P-k- —I have no information about noon.)
Artist Mary Edwards and her mother are
oft to Tahiti for some months. They are
going to camp under the cocoanut to give
Mary who is young and primed with South
bea romance—a chance to paint Miss
h uzzy \\ uz in her native state.
Having decided to raise £lOO for the War

Alec Thomson and Miss Creagh had snared
the musical talent of Mosman for the pro-
gramme and a smiling cluster of V.A.D.’s
for the commissariat. Colonel Spain shep-
herded his flock, and the president of the
club and member for the district Percy
Colquhoun rounded off the angles and made
the large congregation quite at home.
Stella Miles Franklin, of “My Brilliant
Career” and other writings, is toiling in a
new sphere. After several years in Chicago
as an ardent suffragist, and a year or more

Scottish Women’s Hospital somewhere in
Macedonia, and her immediate O.C. is Dr.
Agnes Bennett, of this town. Several other
Sydney women are attached to the same unit,
including Dr. Helen Sexton, who was deco-
rated the other day for work done among
the Servian sick and wounded.
The kiddies’ matinee ball, organised by
Rose Lyons for France’s Day, brought in

HIS Animated Advertising Machine, shown in the right-hand
top-corner, is the smartest advertising money-maker yet
offered to live advertising people. It is an American inven-
tion, and has been remarkably successful in America and
Canada. It is automatic in its working, and is specially
adapted for advertising in shop-windows and first-storey windows,
showing slides 14 inches by inches in length, the figures moving
like human beings. For first-storey window ads. the pictures can be
screened 7ft. by Bft. in length, giving an actual motion-picture of the
advertised article. The machine is specially fitted to be attached to
ordinary electric connections. Bach machine carries 30 slides or
advertisements, and each slide is thrown on the screen for
15secs., which means that each ad. is displayed 30 times on a run of four hours. No attendant
is necessary, and the cost of current is under 2d. per hour. The agent securing the machine
can offer space to advertisers at a ridiculously low rate, and give 100 per cent, efficiency adver-
tising, while big profits may be made for himself. While in America a few weeks back, Mr.
Parker secured the Australasian rights, and now offers them to agents in the different States of
the Commonwealth and New Zealand.
Big Picture-Theatre Proprietors should see the machine, as it is particularly good for
large-screen advertising. The big picture-theatre people in America all have machines.
Set in a handsome shadow-box, the finely-colored pictures shown by this Animated
Advertising Machine make the shop-window brilliantly attractive in the daytime, night-time,
and all the time.

Melbourne, September 10, 3917.
My Dear Yarrie.
The Melba departure from Spencer-street
was a Great Spectacle. Nellie stood like a
rock in a billowing sea of “Con.” girls,
friends, florists’ messengers, telegraph boys
and frenzied outsiders. She looked posi-
tively girlish, and that takes some doing on
a north-wind day in Melbourne. Much
befurred, with her arms full of Spring prim-
roses and boronia, she bade good-bye to pals,
admonished her pupils to be diligent, gave
final instructions to secretary Freda Stern-
berg, and murmured thanks for gifts thrust
upon her. Lady Susan Fitz Clarence dimpled
her good-byes prettily, saying she was “really
sorry to leave Melbourne,” while staunch
supporters in the persons of John Sander-
son. George Allan, Italian Consul Eles, and
Tommy Cochrane stood behind heaps of bag-
gage wearing photographic smiles. Mrs.
Hughes and Lady Doris Blackwood buzzed
about the farewell riot. Pianist St. Leger
took affectionate farewells of stage-manager
Bigo, who stays behind as first gentleman-
in-waiting to the Coombe Cottage fowls and
dogs. Melba is ready for her entree in the
musical world of America, and can step on
the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House
garbed as Marguerite or Mimi at a moment’s
notice.
The Munro Ferguson pair invited 40
guests to a dinner frivol on Thursday night
to amuse niece Doris. After the coffee and
cigarettes the young people two-stepped in
the entrance hall.
Senator Pearce and his wife gave a dance
on Friday night. It was a young people’s
farewell to the Maribyrnong camp and Fly-
ing School boys, and the young Pearce
daughters had pretty new dresses. Marjorie
wore heliotrope and Dorothy silver net and
lace. Mrs. Pearce got into black silk net
fixings. The Forrest dame, Airs. Billy
Hughes and Mrs. Sands went as social over-
seers, and Muriel North attended to enjoy
herself like the two Baillieu girls and
Marion Bridges.
St. Vincent’s Ball was one of the big
events of the season. It was labelled
'Plain, Picture and Poster,” but thez-e was
nothing plain about it except the crow-like
garb of some of the men. The girls who
were not in fancy dress had lovely evening
gowns they w’anted to show. Airs. St. Leger
and Airs. Merson Cooper spent half the day
getting things ready at the St. Kilda Town
Hall, and then appeared at hostess-time
fresher than paint. Airs. St. Leger's gown
was a delicate lilac color and Airs. Alerson
Cooper wore nigger-brown and cream in
stripes with a cross-section of white tulle.
The 21-year-old daughter wore her birthday
frock. The Forrest dame, in black, had her
irrepressible niece Aluriel dressed as Hail
Columbia. Airs. Billy Hughes wore black
and white and her roundest spectacles.
The Alerson Coopers turned their house
upside-down for the coming-of-age of their
only daughter. There were 150 guests, in-
cluding the Simon Frasers, the Cleggs, the
Aladdens, the Fenners and the Alortons. A
little batch of French naval officers were the
spice, and many of the available home-ser-
vice military and naval chiefs rolled along in
uniform. A platoon of adoring young
soldiers helped with the dancing. It was a
party for which most of the women got new
dresses—a notable event these times. The
young hostess was enveloped in a dream of
rainbow pinks and silver, and got loads of
presents, including a new runabout from
dad. (The young woman drives her own
cai’.) The guests danced and played cards
and champagned in the intervals.
The popular Stevenson sisters are mourn-
ing one of their number, dark-eyed Bhoda,
who died very suddenly last week. They are
daughters of the late Geoi’ge Stevenson, of
the Lane.
A pretty little well-dressed American
lady blew into Alelbourne lately in the per-
son of Airs. S. A. Bansora. Hubby is—-or
was—Public Health Officer at Shanghai for
the U.S., and is going to France via N’York.
She is setting sail shortly in hopes of seeing
him before he goes off to look after some of
Uncle’s “Sammies.”
Dr. Carty Salmon is seriously ill. He
overdid it in the early stages of the war.
The Horsfall widow is back from her Syd-
ney trip and perched at the Oriental preen-
ing new feathers, which include fascinating
ivory and putty-colored cloth suits. These

There’s a warm welcome waiting for one
padre, Chaplain (Colonel) J. Crookston, of
St. Andrew’s, Bendigo, whose health com-
pels him to come home after 18 months’
active service. He has two sons still at it —
Sergeant Keith, with the Light Horse ; and
flying-man (late Gunner) Bruce.
A belated mail brings news that Captain
(acting-Major) Percy Bobert Murdoch
Collins, D. 5.0., one of the two soldier sons
(both decorated) of 11. M., was killed in
France on June 25. Born in 1891, his Eng-
lish public school education was topped off
with a course at the Boyal Military
Academy. He got his commission in the
Boyal Garrison Artillery in 1910, and in
that year was one of the team which de-
feated Sandhurst at football under the eyes
of Lord Boberts. Three years’ service at
Hongkong and Canton was the prelude to
his two years in France with a heavy siege
battery, of which he was in command when
the end came. Within a fortnight of his
going to the Front in 1915 he married
“Dodie,” youngest daughter of tlie late
Bichard Grice.
Months and months ago I told you of a
life-saving drill and a boat in which Miss
Strickland (matron) and another nurse were
seated, and of a shark waiting in the water
below—and then of the canting of the boat
through defective tackle, and two minutes
of breathless excitement. Miss Strickland
is matron of the hospital ship Kanowna. and
the chief-officer assures me it couldn’t have
happened on that ship because its tackle is
never faulty:—
I am proud and glad to say that in all our many
drills not the slightest hitch has occurred. The
tackles on our boats are systematically overhauled
every trip and every possible care is taken.
Then, for the further comfort of the friends
of sick and wounded Billjim, the chief tells
more of the practice of the hospital ship :
The plan followed is to let nurses and badly-
wounded or sick patients into the boats at the
promenade deck. The rest get into the boat when
she's in the water. To enable them to do this
ropes and rope-ladders are kept ready for use at a
moment’s notice. Thus, as little stress as possible is
put on the boat-falls, hooks, etc., and the danger of
accident accordingly minimised.
Lieut. Frank Lascelles, son of the Geelong
family, has been killed in action. His father
died last year, and an elder sister was lost
with the Waratah.
Sister Adelaide testifies: —
Delegates from the Children’s Welfare Associa-
tion of Vic. are with us for three weeks to swap
opinions on infant life protection. Our State
Children’s Council, of which we are proud, has
nearly 1900 embryo citizens under its direct control
and as many more living with accredited foster-
mothers.
Tlie governors of St. Peter’s College (C. of E.)
are going to provide hursaries for sons of old
scholars who lose their lives in- the war. Inci-
dentally, forgetting old rivalries, a party of Peters
and Alfreds, 160 strong, foregathered for dinner at
Amiens early in July. Ambulances took the old-
hoys of our two big schools from their billets to the
blow-out, which was “excellent and exquisitely
served.”
A tablet has been unveiled at the University to
the memory of the late Dr. Barlow, for 19 years vice-
chancellor. The donor was his sister, Jane Barlow,
of Ireland.
This yea r Unley is to be denied its usual dissi-
pation of a mayoral reception, and the money that
would otherwise be wasted will honorably go to
swell the Bed Cross Fund.
H. M. Muirhead, Registrar of the Industrial Court,
has followed his three brothers into khaki. Wilfrid,
the second of the F. 11. Snow sons, has got his
majority in the Royal Flying Corps and has been
given command of a squadron in France. Another
South Australian to go up a step is A. Iv, Wendt —-
captain.
The Anglican Synod has set a time-limit for
speeches —lo minutes for the proposer of a motion
and five minutes for his bottle-holder. Now, if the
scheme ,were applied to the pulpit, wouldn’t that be
a dream!
Port Pirie produced some imposing wharf-laborers
at the beginning of the week, when Capt. Davis
(who went to Antarctica with the Aurora), the
Mayor (Sir. J. S. Geddes) and the Rev. H. F. Severn
lent a hand in getting 400 tons of cargo off the
Bulga. The parson is a nephew of the Ivennions,
now at Bath and Wells (Eng.), and at Bishopcourt
here before the Harmers’ day.
Another Rhodes Scholar, Howard Rayner, son of
the Rev. G. C. Rayner of Glcnelg and formerly of
Homebush (Sydney), is in an officers’ school in Eng-
land. Ilis brother, who for months was dumb from
shell-shock, has got back his speech.
What Lady Galway described as “a preliminary
canter to a bigger undertaking later on” was held
at the Alexander McCulloehs’ house in North Adel-
aide on Thursday—a garden fete to raise funds for
Navy Day in October.
Another A.I.F. lost to ns! Lieut. B. J.
Wells, of our Murchison, now on service
abroad, is to marry Marjorie Hall, of I' resli-
fiold Ilall, Brighton, England.
Joyce, only daughter of the Arthur
Cohens, of St. Kilda-road, has accepted a
diamond solitaire from an English officer,
Lieutenant Gerald Kaye, of the 1i.1.A. The
wedding will probably be in England.
Mrs. Fred Fairbairn is crazy to get to
England for daughter Jess’s marriage, but
she cannot scare up another passport. This
is a horrible deprivation for such a con-
firmed world-tripper. Jess —the sporty
youngster with the bright complexion——is to
marry Lieut. Bussell, son of the sheepy
Philip Bussells, of Victoria. A cable says
the wedding will be soon.
Jack Fosbery, of Dalgety’s shipping
braifch, is busy buying lavender gloves and
top hat for his wedding-day. Dorothy Garnet
is to be Mrs. Jack.
There is a terrible fuss about the marriage
of the little Kent Hughes girl. Papa, of
course, has been in Egypt through the whole
hurried course of engagement and marriage.
Captain B. S. Finn, D. 5.0., of Maori-
land, won his distinction on Gallipoli in
August, 1915. There were two Captain
Finns then attached to the Australians, but
B.S. was the one who obtained the
D.S.O. He has since been in France, and
is now in England. Dolly Castles, now in
New York, is engaged to a Captain Finn,
who is also, she says, a D. 5.0.; but Dolly’s
fiance is not the Maori la no officer. The
Alaorilander is tired of being congratulated.
Make a note of it.
Lady Helen took the chair at a meeting
of the Council of the Australian Bed Cross
at Government House last week. The Coun-
cil adopted the request of the over-sea Com-
missioners for an additional £25,900 reserve
fund and an increase in the monthly remit-
tance to £12,000. Colonel Murdoch had
begged, from London, for increased supplies
of foodstuffs for prisoners of war. The
Cairo Commissioner begged for more* fruit,
milk, cocoa, books, pyjamas and old linen
for Egypt. A new and very large Australian
stationary hospital is now planted in the
desert, and it needs vast supplies. Also, the
number of field ambulances in Egypt are
double those of last year.
Miss B. Kaighin, of Melbourne, and Miss
Park Taylor, of Brisbane, are on their way
to Egypt armed with official appointments
as Bed Cross voluntary cooks for the kitchen
attached to the Australian Base Hospital at
Cairo.
Amy Matchett, author of the “Coo-ee Aus-
tralia Souvenir Booklet”—a collection of
patriotic album-verse full of kindly senti-
ment —reminds Billjim’s friends and rela-
tives that the literary trifle can be obtained
at Norman Bros.’, Mullen’s and Cole’s. If
paper, printing and binding cost nothing, the
lady would be delighted to have the whole of
the A.I.F. reading free copies. The proceeds
of the local sale are wholly devoted to the
supply of the booklet to Billjim.
Etcher John Shirlow has been invited to
become an associate of the Boyal Society of
Painter-Etchers, London. Characteristically,
his native Victoria does nothing officially to
recognise him. The fine black-and-white col-
lection in the Melbourne Gallery contains no
print with his signature. Lately he has
been essaying portrait studies, one of his
sitters being poet Bernard O’Dowd ; another
B. H. Croll, of Hawthorn. Next month a
volume of reproductions of some of John’s
best work will be issued by Angus and
Bobertson.
Artist Hughie Paterson is seriously ill in
a private hospital. The hearty, energetic
man went down with a paralytic stroke some
weeks ago.
The Lindsay show is just open at the
Fine Art Society’s Galleries. Alfrcd-place,
off Collins-street. Brothers Norman, Lionel
and Percy have an exhibition of water-color
paintings and etchings at that address, and
art lovers are flocking in to pay their
respects.
The late Franklin Peterson’s collection of
books, music and pictures is now on view at
the Fine Art Society’s Booms. The collec-
tion includes first editions, beautifully
engraved, of Bach, Beethoven, Llandel and
other composers; autographed letters from
Spohr, Berlioz, Bulow. Pinsuti, Saint-Saens
and Mendelssohn; and a large number of
Covent Garden programmes, dated about the
beginning of hast century, including those of
the first English performances of Mozart’s
operas. The musical soul of the period
apparently insisted upon good value, for one
programme offered “Fidelio,” followed by an
Auber opera, “the whole entertainment to
conclude with a well-known farce.”
“J. Caesar” drew lovers of intense culture
to the King’s <0 n Saturday night. Inter-
ne Commissioner Piddington and Delprat
Oi. Broken Hill decorated a d.-c. box. Another
pen was occupied by the 11. H. Champions
? eDert( *y Theatre director Gregan
McMahon. The Jimmy Dyers had some
friends in the front row of the circle, and
Bert Bailey hovered around in unblemished

The Barry Lupino baby had a partv at the

The Lady Northcote Permanent Trust
Fund Orchestra will play again on Saturday
afternoon, September 29. The Brahnis
Spring Symphony is expected to be in sea-
son, and a big effort of Elgar’s is also
promised.
The Grand is having a little strike all on
its own. Eight of the waitresses downed
trays because they objected to buy shorter
aprons, at 2s. each, to match their new uni-
forms. If the girls will only solve the
trouble by taking a loaf out of the Book of
Genesis, business will boom. (You remem-
ber the earliest fashion-note. If you don’t
you can ask the curate next time he calls.)
Yours sincerely.

ALITIES
“Bunyip”: “E.S.S.” (B. l(i/8/’r7) asks
for our 12 best songsters. Well, here goes: Magpie,
butcher-bird, drop-lark, reed-warbler, white-throated
flycatcher, golden wren, blue wren, blue thrush,
mountain-thrush, bellbird, brown cuckoo, ground-
lark. P.S.—-I am 6ft. 3in., weigh 13 stone and have
a reach of 76in.
“Pandamis”: “H.V.E.” (B. 10/5/TT) is
certainly wrong when he says that the death-adder
uses its tail as an anchor when about to attack,
unless the Westralian specimen differs from that
located in North Queensland. I have killed a great
many in the neighborhood of Cape York, and have
experimented with most of them before killing to
see how they bit. Touch one on the middle of the
back with a stick and like a flash the head and tail
strike at the same moment.
“H.W.F.”: Nothing said alters the fact
that I saw a white-ants’ nest used as an oven in
1878 at a railway-survey camp between Cooktown
and the Palmer (Q.)- The plan I knew was to
select an ant-mound the size needed, cut a square
doorway near the bottom and burn out the inside.
Then clean out the ashes and use either ants’-nest
casing or flat stones for the hearth. Put in fire of
dry wood and let it burn out, clean away the ashes,
put in the dough and affix the door to the opening.
There are several of these ovens in use (or were) in
Gippsland Mountains. My present fireplace is lined
for 6ft. up with ant-hill covering, and scores of
other fireplaces are similarly improved to my know-
ledge.
“Tarltou-Il.”: “Dominie Sampson” (B.
16/8/’17) is not the only one bushed about the ti-
tree. Some highly decorated botanists are no
better off. James F. W. Johnston, M.A., mentions
the ti-trees—he calls them tea-trees ( Leptospermum
scoparium and L. thea)— as two of the many sub-
stitutes for the china tea-plant ( Thea viridis). The
Australian vegetable belongs to the Myrtacece, and it
is worth mentioning that two other members of this
order butt into the tea business — Gtaphyria nitida
in Sumatra ; and in Chili Myrtus ugni is used as a
substitute for Paraguay mate. With what one might
call pot-luck the Paraguayonions selected the leaves
of the native holly ( Ilex Paraguayensis) to brew into
tea, and now chemists tell us that the theine of this
plant is identical with that of Souchong, Twankay
and other China crops.
FAIR GAME.
WANDERING SPORT : “Anything one can take a shot at round here, boy?”
BOY (with lively recollections of recent hidings): “There’s the schoolmaster goin’ over
the hill.”
NO BUSH FIRES FOR HIM.
BARBER: “Your hair ought to be singed, sir.”
COCKY (from Kiama): “If yer can’t cut it off, yer blanky well won’t burn it off, if I
know it.”
“E.S.S.”: “Dominie Sampson” says (B.
E 6/8/’ 17) that “tea-tree” should be spelt “ti-
tree.” He is wrong. The ti-tree is distinct, and is
a native of Maoriland. About 16 years ago, on the
suggestion of the late H. J. McCooey, the Secretary
for Lands in N. S. Wales issued a circular to sur-
veyors and draughtsmen, instructing .them that the
word which they had been in the habit of writing
on plans as “ti-tree” should in future be written
“tea-tree.” It was then established that Captain
Cook and his men had made tea out of the dried leaves
of the Australian vegetable, and had named it tea-
tree. As the shrub is not related to the tea-tree of
commerce (Bohea), and is quite different from the
ti-tree, and also because a Queensland aboriginal
name of the white-flowered species is teedoo, I spell
it “tee-tree” as a compromise.
* * * *
“Kookaburra”: The East-West line
threatens to add “sparrow” to the alliterative “sin,
sand, sorrow and sore eyes” that is supposed to sum
up the West. Months ago the advance-guards were
reported to be spying out the land. To check the
coming invasion headquarters here in Westralia
decided to ignore international law and poison the
food and drink supplies along the line of attack.
Latest report is that a lusty young cock-sparrow
was observed at the end of the S.A. section heading
straight for us. I happened across a possible solu-
tion in Perth. Passing a chicken dealer’s I heard a
lady gurgle, “The dear!” I turned and saw “the
dear” in a cage waiting for young Westward-Ho to
come and claim his little brown bride.
“59 : My word, there was trouble last
time mum went to town 1 She was steering down
Collins-street keeping a wary eye for Fiji uncles and
white-slavers, when a clerical-looking party breasted
up and handed her a card, on which was printed,
"Behold, I am with you always.” It took three
policemen to divorce mum from Ebenezer’s throat.
“Eloc”: Nine out of 10 sheep that have
their eyes pecked out by crows die of blood-poison-
ing. There’s an easy and almost sure cure in a
bottle of Condy’s Fluid. Pour a little in the eye-
hole. An essence-of-lemon bottle will hold enough
for about a dozen. But have the mixture strong.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: If a vote was taken to dis-
cover Australia’s favorite bird the winner would
probably be a wren, and there wouldn’t be many of
the family ahead of the blue branch (Malurus
cyaneus ) of S.E. Australia. This wee, frail mite,
with perky tail and legs thinner than violet stalks,
would hold his position for a combination of beauty!
usefulness and song, as well as for gentle nature and
friendliness. The blue wren belongs to a large
genus distributed throughout the continent, and in
all cases, while the males are bedecked finely
generally blue heads and black backs—the ladies are
clothed in sombre brown. A cousin of the superb
warbler is a Bananaland beauty. This is the orange-
backed wren with a jet black head and body and
brilliant scarlet back. He has my vote for beauty,
but loses points otherwise. This genus are falseiy
charged with being Mormons. The fact is this. The
males only attain full plumage in old age, and many
of the dowdy clan of hangers-on always seen in the
bright-colored male’s company are immature gents.
Other Australian wrens belong to different genus,
and dress with a quiet, Puritanical touch. They are
all useful citizens, abhorring won’t-work tactics,
snakes and cats. Best known is the streaked-brown
field-wren, cursed by quail shooters when a dog
sets ’em, and blessed by all who love a sweet
song. Then there are the scrub-wrens, about a
dozen of them, all timid and hard to locate in the
undergrowth. The rare grass-wrens of the interior
I’ve not been introduced to, but to the last wren of
all, the emu-wren, I lifts me lid.
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
THE REINFORCEMENT : “Say, Digger, wot
ther ’ell do you, usually do during a bom-
bardment like this ’ere?”
THE ANZAC : “Oh, play cards.”
“Norseman”: Coming up from Wilcannia
to Wanaaring- (N.S.W.) I dropped in at a woolshed
dance which was to Win the War —at least, such
was its stated object. All was ready, floor greased,
women ditto, but no musician till I saw a chap
being led in with a concertina. He was a Darling
abo. who can play guitar, lyre, mandolin, mouth-
organ, violin, harp and other instruments. He was
a shy black and never once raised his face to look
at the hoppers, and at the finish of each dance he
bashfully retired, though many a white with much
less musical skill would have remained to put on
dingo.

BIDING SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All the men were up and doing long before the break
of day,
And we saddled up and mounted when the east was
turning gray;
Then we ambled forth in column and we knew that
. we were free
As we rode from Tel-el-Farali to the sandhills by
the sea.
It was pleasant, easy going,
And the stars were faintly showing
On the road from Tel-el-Farah to the sea.
Oh, the thought of take-it-easy caused the light of
joy to leap
Into eyes worn red and weary by long nights of
broken sleep,
For the heavy hand of duty was compelled to let us
be
When we rode from Tel-el-Farah to the rest-camp by
the sea.
Oh, the beach was wet and hazy,
And the waves broke loud and crazy
Down the road from Tel-el-Farah to the sea !
Every eager horse responded to the welcome of the
surf,
And they raced across the sandhills as they’d
crossed the level turf.
And the horsemen soon dismounted in disorder, mixed
with glee,
Twenty miles from Tel-el-Farah, at the horselines by
the sea.
Horsemen took their mounts a-swimming.
And the cup of joy was brimming
Twenty miles from Tel-el-Farah, by the sea.
Now the languid days are over and the call is stern
and plain ;
We must saddle up and ration for the danger zone
again;
We must get our things together and go hard and
hurriedly
Up the road to Tel-el-Farah from the sandhills by
the sea.
For the battle-fires are burningi-
But we’ll shortly be returning
Down the road from Tel-el-Farah to the sea.
PALESTINE.
GERARDY.
“Bill Bowyang”: Binghi is a pathetic
figure when anything goes wrong with his health,
but lie’s not in the same paddock as the Gippo
laborers employed by the military here in Egypt and
Palestine. A sick Gippo is about the most dispirit-
ing panorama that one could behold. His com-
plexion is usually changed from a good., healthy
chocolate to a washed-out yellow. There is a look
in his eye like that of a lizard that has just lost
its tail. He is shrouded in a blanket, which is
wound closely round his head and allowed to hang-
down over his shoulders. His arms and legs are
bare, and he shivers though the day may be hot
enough to fry Sheol. The weight of his affliction
presses too closely on him for mere speech. He
moans a little, groans a little, presses his hand to
his stomach, and looks unutterable anguish. There
is always a big sick patade after a Taube has
dropped a few bombs on a Gippos’ camp. The crash
of the shell seems to remind them of the number of
complaints they are capable of suffering from. The
best remedy is the sight of one of our own machines
soaring heavenwards like a protecting angel.

“A.J.R.”: Of tlie many safeguards against
cbaffcutter accidents that have been devised all have
the defect that their operation depends on the man
in trouble. They mostly consist of placing the revers-
ing lever in as handy and prominent position as
possible; but generally a victim whose arm is being
ground through rollers and eut into lengths loses his
head. The proper time to prevent accident is before
it happens, and to this end the best idea I have seen
was on Harry Jamieson's machine in Berrigan
(N.S.M.). Tlie guard consisted of a piece of gal-
vanised-iron reaching back from the rollers about a
foot, thus compelling a margin of safety of at least
nine inches. Nine in ten chaffcutter accidents are
the result of working needlessly close to the feed-
rollers. Even in feeding thrashed straw I always
found it possible to maintain a six-inch clearance,
while with even tlie poorest hay there is no need to
approach tlie rollers closer than nine inches or a
foot. The introduction of the Jamieson idea would,
in my opinion, effectively safeguard all hands, includ-
ing the' inexperienced and the damfool.
“tickle’ - : Out here in western N.S.W.
we were all admiring the display of the Aurora
Australis on the night of the 9th. I pointed out a par-
ticularly bright beam of light shooting up far into
the sky to a bush chap standing near. “Cripes!’’ he
said. “Isn’t it a bonzer? Look, it goes right across
the sky 1” He was going into ecstasies over the
Milky May, which he had only just discovered, after
being about 50 years on earth !
"Lantana”: Dunno whether they grow
longer elsewhere, but this is the record death-adder
on the N. S. Males North Coast. It was massacred
at Eden Creek and taped 27 inches.

Eddyson : Coyle was beset with a pro-
blem—how might a man keep his barmaids? The
discovery of payable quartz at Tinkettle had brought
a number of eligible and affectionate young bachelors
into the district catered for by Coyle’s Teamsters’
Inn, and there was an emphatic demand for female
society in the bar. In the absence of a barmaid
Coyle’s trade slumped with a suddenness that left
no room for doubt as to its cause. Coyle brought a
barmaid from Melbourne. She served five weeks, and
then Craddock married her. Coyle wired an agent
for a second Hebe. The lady was forthcoming, and
she married Dunstan nine weeks later. Coyle pro-
duced a dark barmaid, finding blondes in too strong
demand. She was married to M’illiams within two
months in defiance of the covenant. Then Coyle
despatched a message for No. 1, and Ilortense arrived,
llortense was tall, dark, attractive and of a confiding
and kindly disposition. Jude and Harrington began
a hot competition for her exclusive regard, Coyle
watching progress with pathetic concern. Jude and
Harrington were large, fierce men. and served a use-
ful purpose in holding off all other suitors. It was as
much as an ordinary man’s life was worth to come
between them. “If you get her,” said Harrington to
Jude in friendly admonition, “I will cave your head
in with a sled. Jude was equally communicative.
“It she marries you,” he told Harrington pleasantly,
“she will be a widow within the week. The matter
will have my personal attention.” The situation re-
mained strained for close upon five months, and then
doubts and speculation were abolished by the simul-
taneous disappearance of Harrington and Hortensc.
Two days later there was reliable information to the
effect that the pair had been seen on the Adelaide
This isn't a guessing competition. To settle the bet before ft
there are 2226 pairs in this load of rabbits. The other week THE BULLETIN
introduced Australia's-perhaps the world's-first rabbit-trapping magor,
Thos. W. Draper, of Broidwoud (N.S.W.). For seven years he was manager
of the Braidwood Refrigerating Co. Then he reckoned that there was more
money in organising the business of trapping bunny for export; and this
is part of the supply which he handles daily at his Ballaba freezing
express, going west. Coyle was terribly distressed.
The defection of former maids had put him out;
this abandonment almost broke his heart. “But you
know what they are, man,” Clever said in his
capacity of counsel and comforter. “Have another
try. Fix the next one with a strong agreement.”
Coyle put up his hands in protest. “Strong agree-
ment!” he wailed. “Where's the agreement that
will hold them ? Why, dammit, man, 1 married
Hortense!”

‘ Leo Lear” : Any drover know why sheep
when drinking from troughs always make to the
tap end ? It isn’t for a cool swill, as they do it
irrespective of the water’s temperature. Even if
your trough is 50ft. long the jumbucks crowd and
push round the inflow.
Another little peculiarity
of sheep is their contempt
for camping cover. They’ll
leave good shelter on a
wild night and camp on
the most exposed hilltop
in the paddock. This may
be an inherited instinct to
see the approach of
enemies. In whatever low
class you place the woolly
animal’s brain otherwise,
I put him number one as
an engineer. He’ll set out
a grade on a hillside with
any 8.C.E., put in curves
switches and zig-zags, and
reach the top without
straining his boiler. I’ve
only once seen a mob of
sheep take a hill in the
face. It was after the
break of the 1902 drought.
We were mustering off the
ranges at the back of
Alexandra (Vic.), and the
orders were to truck the
weak ones and drove the
balance of the mob. There
were no yards, so all
hands and dogs got be-
hind the jumbucks, and
them hell-for-germany up a steep pinch. The
strong beasts were soon over the top. but the others
chucked it. I enter this as the quickest and most
effective draft in the Commonwealth.

the amount of alcohol in the system. I flatter mv-
self my blood is f.a.q.. and that I don’t stop more
than the next man, but in AVestralia, owing to
lumps, blisters and sores caused by sandfly bites, I
couldn't put a razor on my face for a month.

happy-go-lucky vagabond the cuckoo. The mag-
pie for his carol next, followed by the merry, mock-
ing bush-lawyer (also called wattle-bird and
leatherhead), the bell-bird (whose chimes ring
through Gippsland fern gullies), willy-wagtail, the

canary and the Australian skylark.

Momokani” : Miss Grimshaw writes about
living on native produce in Papua. This is my view
of the facts. Agriculturists don’t exist in Papua,
no one having any time for anything except cocoa-
nuts and rubber, which are very poor fare. Only
one plantation in the whole of the country has its
own killing cattle. As for the wild pig, the flesh,
when obtainable, is about as tough, stringy and
nasty_ as any I know. Wallaby, so lamb-like, is
conspicuous by its absence where I am. Eatable
birds, when obtained by the £l-a-month shooting-
>oy, often require 24 hours* boiling and a sledge-
hammering to make them edible. Besides, how many
can afford to keep a boy for nothing else but shoot-
mg. . A prolonged diet of sweet potatoes, sweet
only in name, is liable to bring on all kinds of
ailments, and are as sloppy and tasteless as pith.
Maize I have seen in only one or two places myself—
just small patches grown to feed a horse ' Miss
Grimshaw refers to tropical fruit as if it was
ambrosia Can she honestly compare any tropical
trint with the fruit grown in sub-tropical climes?
1 ask Miss Grimshaw to name half a dozen places
in Papua where temperate vegetables are grown 1
know she grew none on her “Coral Island.” Fowls
may increase like flies in the bush, but their lives
must be as short, for no one can find them. Sago
may be all it is described, but when a man lives
on native food only he is generally considered to
have gone native.” Miss Grimshaw’s “Coral
sland may have rivers teeming with fish, but most
of the rivers in this part of the country are nothing
else but raging torrents. One of the 'largest rivers
in Papua is near here, and there is not a fish in it

“V.” : The large livid-blue bottle-tick com-
mon in coastal scrubs sometimes obtains its blood
supply from unexpected sources. I have even found
one clinging to the forehead of a lyre-bird chick
(By the way, has any Abo. handled a well-grown
lyre-bird chick? From my experience, the operation
usually 1 esults in torn and bleeding hands for the
youngster never fails to use its powerful tow, armed
with sharp horny points. Meanwhile, the young
fowl emits a series of piercing calls, which can be
heard half a mile away, and which bring papa and
mamma lyre-bird to the rescue.) Young foals run-
ning in scrubby coastal country also furnish the
bottle-tick with nutriment. However, unlike his
lethal brother, the bush tick, he instils no poison
into his victims. The bush tick, apart from the
great mortality it causes among dogs, is often fatal
also to foxes and sometimes to cats. Strange that no
seropathist has yet taken to this insidious insect. A
cure for its wound or protective inoculation would be
worth thousands.

“5.0. H.”: Chicory and coffee as a substi-

It has a thick brown leaf, which, when cut and
dried for a few days, makes excellent pipe-fuel. By
inhaling the smoke of this plant I have known eases
of chronic asthma to be cured. I got the knowledge
from a Chow on Hampton Downs, who was at the
time using the weed as a substitute for the for-
bidden drug.

\ Real Triumph Beyond
Doubt for
Witt s phis
Kidney & Bladder
Where is there a woman who has not heard it said that if a
man had to endure half the ailments, pains and anxieties that a
woman suffers from time to time he would die under the strain.
i’his very probably is true. Women, owing to the delicacy of their
organic construction, do suffer acutely, in some cases at intervals,
in other cases for the greater part of their lives.
While a good deal of this suffering in women is difficult to
account for, still a very great deal of it is simply and solely due to
weakened kidneys and bladder, both of which organs are subject
to greater strain and more liable to derangement in a woman than
in a man. Women, further, suffer considerably because, from an
altogether disproportionate amount of modesty, they prefer to
suffer in silence rather than to make their condition known to
others, even of their own sex, on such matters.
Sometimes their suffering becomes so acute that they are
driven to search diligently for something which will bring even
temporary relief. Fortunately many women use sound common-
sense and their own judgment in regard to the treatment of their
peculiar ailmehts.
“I suffered terribly with kidney and bladder weakness and
rheumatic pains for over ten years. The sufferings I went through
were a trial. I became very depressed and absolutely unfit for
anything, even my household duties. Knifelike pains seemed to
catch me in the back; at times they would come on so severe as to
make me quite helpless. I was really in a very bad state. I tried
anything and everything I heard of, different remedies and treat-
ments of all kinds, but nothing seemed to do me any good.
“I had heard a good deal about De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills and what a wonderful remedy they are for suffering woman-
kind, so I decided to get a box and give them a trial. The results
were most astonishing, gravel and sediment were brought away
after the first two doses, and I got wonderful relief. I persevered
with the pills and I gradually got brighter and better day by day.
They completely cleared away the bladder pain and kidney, trouble,
and the rheumatism that I had completely left me. This is now a
year and a half ago and I have not had the slightest twinge of
pain since. De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, in my case, have
proved a veritable godsend, for they have absolutely cured me.
Knowing how much good they have done me I have been able to
speak most highly of them, and am very pleased to be able to
recommend them to other women who suffer as I did.”
Mrs. Holt, the lady in question, who lives at 20 Windsor
Street, Nuneaton, was cured about Christmas, 1912, now over
three years ago. On April 18, 1916, she said, “I can gladly
confirm all that 1 have said previously about the wonderful
efficacy of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills. Not only did I
derive such prompt relief from them, but through letting other
like sufferers know, I have been the means of bringing relief to a
great many women who suffered as I did. They worked a splendid
cure in my case and I shall always gladly recommend them
wherever I go. My health continues to be very good.”
Another lady living quite near to Mrs. Holt was similarly
afflicted. At No, 23, Victoria Street, Nuneaton, lives Mrs. Wykes,
who was suffering in a similar way to Mrs. Holt. “For over
eleven years,” says Mrs. Wykes, “I suffered with terrible kidney
trouble and most acute backache pains. At various times through
The suffering and
misery of worn-out,

De Witt’s proved a veri-
table godsend. They
absolutely cured me.
this long period of suffering I have been in a very bad condition,
pains striking me across the back and loins; to stoop was torture
and every action was a trouble. It was just as if a vise bad g
hold of me and was screwing me up. I tried many remedies, nrs
one and then another recommending me to different things, bu
nothing seemed to touch my case. During the early part ot
I heard of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, and I determine
to give them a trial. I am thankful I did, because I seemed
gain relief after the very first dose. I got another 2/9 bottle iron
.Mr. Baker’s shop in Abbey Street, and felt much better; I g°
brighter and more active and in fact felt a different woman,
intended to make a good cure of my case seeing that I was S ettiag
so much relief, and I am pleased to say that I have done ,
because for the past 12 months I have been absolutely clear or mj
old complaint and have not had the slightest trace of any kind o
backache.”
Nearly three years afterwards —April, 1916 —Mrs. Wykes
said, “De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills did me permanent go ■
there is not the slightest doubt about that; I always recomine
them with a strong feeling of gratitude for what they have do
for me.”
Here is the testimony of two women who have known, eacM
a different kind of case, but in both cases the same organs
weakened kidneys—were at the bottom of it. ,
Many people have kidney trouble and do not know ifi aa
would be glad to know how they 7 could recognise whether •
really have any form of kidney trouble. Here are the ways to t •
Have you a nasty taste in your mouth the first thing ,
morning, puffiness under the eyes, general feeling of weakness
irritability, aches and pains in various parts of the body, n
you constipation, cloudy urine, or sharp stabbing or aching pa
—a pain “as though my back will break?” These are „ f s m
and certain symptoms of kidney trouble, and those who suffer
backache, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, cystitis (lnffam
tion of the bladder) or pains in the muscles and joints are
suffering these pains through weak or diseased kidneys, tor t
are positively the symptoms of kidney trouble.
Suffering men and women should always bear in m ' n< L ,gj v
to cure any kind of kidney or bladder trouble you must pos •
make sure that your remedy does really touch the kidnej
bladder. Whatever remedy you use must pass right throug
kidneys and bladder, and not through the bowels, as most ■
pills do. When you see the urine changes to a muddy bluisi L jj er
—a feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and **i JL V
Pills from all other kinds—you know, beyond all doubt, tna •
have put their healing touch on the right spot —the kidney
the bladder. These wonderful pills, going straight to the ku •\j
give such amazingly quick relief every time. They are gent
yet penetrating, searching yet soothing, and a permanent
follows in almost everv case. You can understand that'' , aV( ,
proved remedy, such as De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder im-
penetrated right into every crevice of the kidneys and o '
carrying their healing properties with them. It is only c°
sense to believe you will get just the same benefit as did Mrs.
and Mrs. Wykes if you give them a fair trial.
Dp Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills are sold by Chemists and Storekeepers everywhere 2/9 and 5/6 per box. Large size contains two-and-a-half times as many as the 2/9
size—most advantageous. TRIAL BOX FREE and plainly packed if you send 3d. stamps for postage, etc. If you have anv difficulty in eettinz aenuine De w'itt’s Pills—

“M.P.A.” : A word about Prime Minister
Hughes’s order that Australian flour for
Java must be consigned to the British Con-
sul. If the little gentleman with the hot-air
balloon had troubled to ask the advice of a
few of our commercial travellers who have
struck Batavia and tried to get a word with
the said Consul, he would have appointed a
home-made agent for the Commonwealth. It
is easier for an Australian to get an inter-
view with Rockefeller on a mail day than
with the British Consul-General at Batavia.
The market for Australian flour, ham, butter,
bacon, fruit, etc., is much greater than is
supposed, and if we had sufficient business
capacity we should show some signs of it
before the Yanks and the Japs collar the lot.

“Kopai”: Returning home from a late
assignment the other night I met my friend
the senior-constable at the gate of the public
gardens, and we strolled on together. We
were passing through an old pine avenue
when an appalling stench struck our nos-
trils. “Wind must be blowing from South
Kensington,’’ I said. “Don’t look up!” he
answered irrelevantly but with intense feel-
ing. “Don’t look up!’’ “What’s on?” I
asked, mystified. “Don’t look up!” he
answered again, still peering low. “Eyes
down” we made our way towards tlffi other
entrance. At the young Constable
Green was awaiting his chief. “Noticed a
bit of a smell in there, Green,” said the
senior, casually. “Just have a look round,
will you?” “Look here, senior,” I said, as
Green disappeared into the gloom. “Let me
into the know !” “The last time I smelt that
smell, my boy,” the sub-officer retorted, “I
had the job o’ cutting down a man who’d
hanged himself in those pines.” He patted
the silver chevron on his coat-sleeve. “You
get that for experience, my boy!” he added.
“No. 87”: Well, he deserves success for
being ready to seize his opportunities. To
overcome the difficulty arising from the stop-
page of the supply of German dyes a project
was set on foot in England to start dye fac-
tories on a large scale. Nippon at once
skipped across to England to watch the ex-
periments, and is now out in the world’s
markets with the goods, while in England
the industry merely potters along for want
of labor.
“Duct”: Re the modern miracle of heal-
ing with glands (B. 5/7/T7), Redbank (Q.)
works last year saved the thyroid glands and
exported them. The A.M.E. works, which
is looked on as a branch of Armour’s, also
tried saving these organs; but labor costs
were too high. By the way, the Chinese
make a medicine out of the suprarenal
glands. Anyone know anything about it?
* * * *
“Tunic”: I disagree with “Enzedder” (B.
16/8/T7) as to the clothing of Billjim. I
have seen the uniforms of the soldiers of all
the nations fighting at the present time, and
declare that the Australian is the
best-clothed of the lot. The Maorilander’s
tunic is well worthy of mention; but the
tunic is not the outfit. As to underclothing,
I have chatted with Billjim—hundreds of
him —at Salisbury during the coldest winter
England has had for 60 years, and he made
special mention of his warm clothing. Apart
altogether from the splendid slouch hats, the
Tommies envy the Kangaroos their West
End quality materials and finish. I never
saw Tommy walking round one of “Enzed-
der’s” Maorilanders.

“L to Z”: Some time ago a new Gipps-

box one morning a small newspaper parcel
which on being opened released £5O worth of
soiled banknotes. Effort was made to dis-
cover the owner, but without avail, and
the bank was beginning to become reconciled
to the 50 as conscience money, or something
of the sort, when one afternoon a huge,
soiled stranger entered and put a veiy dirtj
cheque do’vl for pa.vmeut The cheque was
criticallv examined and returned. No
account“ What’s that mean?” demanded
the°huge man “This person, Blanker, has

“Well, yer a liar, and a 7 liar 1

of opening an account was explained, he

“Petifi”: The shipping shortage threatens
to hit the Australian wine industry close to
the neck. No juice has been shipped for
many months, and vignerons—especially the
small ones —are wondering what is going to
happen. The custom has been for the little
growers to sell to the big firms, which had
facilities for storing, etc. But there is a
limit to the present holding space, and unless
some of the stocks are shifted soon, a few
of the big buyers won’t have room for any
small producer’s output. Which means
that the s.p. will either have to haul
in liis bush until the weather fines or sell
to any speculator who cuts into the game.
There is money in that, probably. Most
things don’t improve with age; but wine
does, so the capital put into juice to wait

lying idle by any means.

“X.Y.”: “M.G.’i (B. 26/7/Y7) wants to
know “Why not making cooking utensils
out of concrete?” Because, apart from the
difficulty and expense of constructing con-
crete pots, they would be very wasteful of
fuel, as the ingredients are wretched con-
ductors of heat.
Still another vote of thanks to the other
William. For 40 years the fine slate quarries
at Bangor, on the Tamar (Tas.), have been
idle, people finding it less bother to pav for
imported galvanised-iron with in lOU.' But
now that the submarine has got basy iron
is off, so a Sydney syndicate is resurrecting
the quarries, and in a few months should
be shipping house-tiles to the mainland.
* * * #
“Te Whare”: Ginseng, John Chinaman's
boss medicine-plant, if it succeeds in Aus-
tralia, should turn in fair dividends. Ameri-
can ginseng (Panax quinquefolium), in the
shape of dry root, is worth, at latest quota-
tion available, from 10s. to 20s. per lb., in
bulk, according to quality, which varies a
good deal. But the ginseng grown in Korea
(Panax schinseng ) is said to fetch its weight
in gold at times, and at present is worth
about £2O per catty of one and a quarter lb„
or about 20s. per oz.—in bulk, not by retail
The best American root brings only about
£3 per lb. retail, less than one-fifth of the
bulk value of the imperial ginseng of Korea.
The American species was raised in Adelaide
Botanic Gardens over 30 years ago, but the
plant was allowed to die out, and difficulties
have since arisen in regard to the germina-
tion of seed. Nevertheless, as the cost would
amount to only a few shillings, an experi-
mental ginseng plot might be wrnrth while.

“0.5. H.”: Pearl buttons (B. 9/8/17)?
Well, last month 11 Jap schooners dropped
dowm to the islands off the Barrier and
secured from four to 10 tons each of pearl-
shell, which in Nippon is worth about
a ton to button-makers. So, you see. Aus-
tralia will not be left stranded for pyjama
fasteners, thank God !
* * * *
“Pick”: Following the example set by
their neighbors the N.S.W. South Coast
dairymen, some of the Southern Monaro
sheepmen have lately commenced experiment-
ing w’ith drought-resisting grasses. At
Merambego, near the Vic. border, a paddock
40 yards by 20 yards, sown v T ith blue-grass,
fed *4O hoggets and three cows throughout
last w’inter, when, owing to dry conditions,
flocks on their customary areas (sheep and
a half to the acre) were dying of starvation.
What herds could be raised in Australia
were the chapce-the-luck systems of dealing
with the soil set aside for up-to-date
methods!
THE ETERNAL CHANTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, a fine old ship was my last packet,
She could run before the wind or tack it
An’ sail through hell an’ stand the racket;
Blow, boys, blow,
An' raise it from below !
She was handsome rigged from truck to keel,
With a jaunty poise an’ a graceful heel,
An’ a wheel-house over her steerin’ wheel.
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!
From London Docks to the River Plate,
From cold Cape Horn to the Golden Gate,
With a kind Old Man an ’a soft-voiced mate;
Blow, boys, blow,
An’ let her flimsies show.
From Puget Sound to the Lonsdale Rip,
From Akyab to the Mississip,
There was never a ship could lick that ship—
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!
Her cook he came from the P. and 0.
As black as a coon in a minstrel show,
An’ he baked the duff an’ the cakes just so:
Blow, boys, blow,
For a cook from the P. and, 0.
There was ham an’ eggs for the loomin' meal,
An’ bread as wasn’t stone nor steel,
An’ a tot o’ grog as you left the wheel.
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!
No soogy-mooge when the days were chilly,
Nor kicks nor cuffs to drive you dilly,
Nor sweatin’ at night on the handy-billy—
Blow, boys, blow,
Aloft the yard must go!
It was rum, hot rum, red, rare and old,
As a batterin’ ram agen’ the cold,
An’ a nice soft job in the after-hold—
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!
In the swelt’rin’ heat o’ the Tropic days
It was knock off work an’ smoke an’ laze,
An’ yarn o’ the good old hooker’s ways.
Blow, boys, bloic,
An’ let the hooker go!
Lollin’ in the cool o’ the croonin’ Trade
As the porpoises leaped an’ the fishes played,
Dreamin’ o’ the love o’ your latest maid —
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!
There was real gold quids on reachin’ port,
An’ liberty days an’ lots o’ sport
Alovin’ o’ the wives we didn’t ought;
Blow, boys, blow,
For Sailor Town, yah ho !
Oh, the nights o’ noise an’ song an’ cheer,
An’ old salt’s tales right good to hear
(Old Sailor Town is seldom drear!) —
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!
But there’s none o’ that in this yer clipper
With her Cain-brand mate an’ flint-heart skipper,
An’ the first port touched here’s one who’ll slip ’er—
Blow, boys, away,
For the shores of Sydney Bay!
For the darn dead-horse neighs overhead,
An’ it’s tough salt-junk an’ granite bread,
An’ work as’d drive a sailor dead.
Blow, boys, bully boys... .B’lay !
AT SEA.
JACK HAMILTON
THE LAUNDRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The laundry is a clumsy knave —
It wears my linen out, not I.
God, who hates waste, will never save
The laundress when she comes to die;
He will not save from hell or hurt
The woman who destroys my shirt.
•
For if I buy of collars six,
The laundress takes her will of three r
They that are left me by her tricks
Are frayed and ragged shockingly;
This miscreant who wrecks my duds
I’d like to drown in her own suds.
The tailors’ and the mercers’ friend,
The jackal of the drapers she,
Who, ere their time, does make an end
Of singlets and of hosiery.
And so I curse that private she,
My new pyjamas’ enemy.

POLITICAL
POINTS
During the talk on the new Loan Bill in
the Reps, the other night the Phewsion was
found guilty of dharging the cost of a pre-
sentation gold watch to Cohen. Also the
wonderful Win-the-War Government ad-
mitted borrowing £2OO or £3OO as a first in-
stalment towards a polite and fitting history
of Australia’s part in the scrap. But the
Phewsion is so besotted with the lOU sys-
tem of finance that it sees nothing irregular
in those proceedings, and regards continuous
cadging as quite as natural as breath-
ing and as inevitable as the seasons.
It followed, therefore, that when John
Forrest asked for leave to borrow
£80,000,000, his supporters’ ennui was
monumental. All that evening the bells
tinkled for a quorum without any sign of
awakening life on the part of the National-
ists. In fact, Forrest might have been ask-
ing for tuppence to buy the cough-drops he
so badly needed for all the interest the
Fusees manifested. It shows the degenera-
tion of the Win-the-War crowd when it
couldn’t maintain a house to see the largest
Loan Bill in our history through the first
stages of the second reading.
MA —WHO MEANDERED.
RAY: “Your mother’s very strict with you,
isn’t she?”
MAY: “Yes, ma’s trying to bring me up the
way she should have gone.”
The Federal Parliament, against the
advice of Bigjohn’s two predecessors, has
decided, to exempt the next war loan, at
any rafe, from income tax. It will be
doing ap ill service to Australia if it exempts
any more. The debt is growing so large
and the annual interest charge is so great
that the withdrawal of this huge capital
sum from the taxable area will throw a
frightfully increased burden upon the ordi-
nary taxpayer. There never should have
been any exemption at all. The country
should have known precisely what it was
paying. With exemptions it doesn’t know,
because the longer the war lasts and the
heavier the debt and the interest bill, the
more is the exemption worth, because the
less all other wealth will produce net. And
f
it is unfair in another way: it is worth far
more to the big man than to the little one.
To the latter it may be worth only Is. in the
£; to the former anything up to 55., or
whatever the maximum rate of income tax
on investments may be.
“Shall Starvation Win?” asked the melo-
dramatic 11. E. Boote, in Sydney Worker
last week. Well, it might have won if the
sensible people of N. S. Wales hadn’t decided
to set to and feed themselves and Boote
and Boote’s deluded readers with “black”
food. And Labor allowed itself to be led co
the “black” dinner-tabte like a lamb. The
fact that Boote is still alive and writing
instead of lying an em&ciated wreck in his
own wastepaper-basket shows that starva-
tion need never be feared while there is a
crust of “black” bread in the State.
The value of a catch-cry, even for so small
a thing as a municipal election, was illus-
trated at Footscray on
August 23. The antag-
onists were a fellmonger,
advocating the establish-
ment of new industries,
and a retiring councillor
conspicuous for his oppo-
sition to offensive trades.
The situation was com-
plicated by the fact that
the fellmonger was the
selected candidate of the
local Labor body, and
the other a ’vert running
as an Independent. Then
some student of “Nation-
alist” methods evolved
the catch-phrase: “Vote
for and no smells!”
Of course, the fellmonger
was no more an advo-
cate of smells than the
other fellow, but the
phrase caught on and
spread like a pantomime
gag, with the unfortunate
worker in skins panting
behind and trying to ex-
plain away the damag-
ing implication that he
did want smells! Poli-
tical Labor brought up
its great Parliamentary
guns and talked “solid-
arity” in stentorian
tones from countless
street cofners, but with-
out avail. The League’s anointed went down
and out by a 2 to 1 majority. Rule 1 of
politics as of advertising: First catch your
catch-phrase.
Britain has its hands so full of winning
the war that it hasn’t done much towards
winning trade after the w r ar. A few projects
are, nevertheless, in hand, mostly based on
German pre-war models. The most ambi-
tious is the British Trade Corporation,
w T hich has the blessing of the Treasury and
the Board of Trade. Authorised capital is
£10,000,000; a million has already been put
up and another million and a half was being
asked for the other day. This is the idea: —
There exists to-day no large British financial in-
stitution possessing an industrial department or an
organisation for study and research into new ideas
or inventions, which is specially equipped to examine
and nurse new schemes or developments until suffi-
ciently proved and ripe for public investment. The
Corporation will aim at becoming a link between
British industry and the British investor. It will
take a lead in the formation of syndicates to deal
with business of promise and importance, and it will
associate with itself other banking and financial in-
stitutions which care to participate in its operations.
An industrial bank of this character is
badly wanted in Australia. It ought to be
the institution to which the man with com-
mand of raw material (including ideas)
would naturally turn for advice and assist-
ance ; and it ought to be of such a character
as to be able to practically command what-
ever tariff protection it might deem necessary.
The nearest approach this part of the world
has to anything of the kind is in the Bank
of New T Zealand. When that concern w T as
tottering 20-odd years ago the State went
to its rescue and became a large shareholder,
and, though it didn’t have “an organisation
for study and research into new ideas or
inventions,” what it has been able to do for
Maoriland is of incalculable value.
A note from the Front: —
I wish the Australian men who still sit tight at
home could watch the doctors sending back men,
wounded two and three times many of them, before
they are properly fit. I wish they could hear the
doctors telling these men, when they complain, that
they have no option, their instructions being “so
many per day.” I have seen men with one leg
shorter than the other, after fracture by machine-
gun bullets, being sent back for another go, wearing
special boots.
Meantime at home, in order to save bis own
skin, Hughes promised not to introduce con-
scription during the life of the Parliament
then being elected. And in the camps there
still are men who have never been at the
Front, though they have been drawing the
country’s pay for anything from a year up-
wards. For the most part these men are
professing to train recruits; and they are
not one-tenth part as qualified for the job
as some of these wounded men who have to
hobble back into the trenches on specially-
built boots. And that’s how we Win the
War.
Cabled that J. D. Connolly, the new
Agent-General for Westralia, while en route
for London spoke a little piece to the
Canadian Club at Vancouver: —
The Referendum was not the best way to decide
any bitterly contested issue, such as conscription, in
consequence of the liability to misrepresentation.
The Government had better cable Connolly
telling him to either hold his tongue or come
home. If a referendum is not the best way
to decide any bitterly-contested issue, then
we are all wrong in protesting that there
should be no strike until the Labor union
affected has taken a secret ballot of its
members.
ANOTHER HIT.
“Young man, what are you doing for your
country?”
“ Oh , I stay home and mind the kids while
the missus sells buttons.”
One of the silliest things Australia has
ever done with public money was to devote
some of it to the repatriation of certain
“Russian refugees,” who, as soon as the Czar
disappeared, were assisted back to their own
country. A suspicion, if not an absolute
certainty, of German intrigue attaches to
this demand for repatriation. The one un-
doubted fact concerning some of the heftiest
of the “poor refugees” was their bitter
hatred for Britain. The largest maggot in
their Muscovite brain was the “secret
treaty” maggot. They were bent on burst-
ing up England’s “secret treaty” with the
Czar’s Government. They regarded their
alleged country’s connection with England
as an unholy alliance of aristocrats, their
feelings towards aristocrats being unfit for
publication. And these smouldering fire-
brands were packed back to Russia at the
expense of the Government! Our Exchequer
provided them with the means to go and do
their best to lose the war for our side!
Overworked Premier Peacock proposes—
when he has time and other promised
measures are passed and the war is over and
the century is old —to bring in a bill to
allow of wife-deserters and such like expen-
sive State guests being employed on the
roads, and so made to earn their keep as
well as provide something for the missus
and kids. The idea has merit, but where is
the need for a william? All that is called
for is such commonsense administration
as will compel all able-bodied prisoners to
earn their own tucker and a good bit over.
Labor unions have lately decided that the
time has come to cut out parasites. As
they are quite right in that, they presum-
cibly won t offer any more silly objections
to keeping the prisoners in gaols hard at
productive work.
i P rac tice of declaring various things
black because they were produced or
handled by non-unionists comes rather late
in the day. More than half of all the goods
that have come to Australia and have done
Australian union workmen out of a job have
been produced by non-unionists. Every dav
of their lives the wharfies handle “black”
goods—goods produced not only by non
unionists, but by non-unionists employed on
sweating terms. But Labor never turns n
hair over those goods and doesn’t, as a rule
care two straws about Protection. There is
nothing more illogical in all the world. S
Willie Kelly is annoying the Phewsion
with a charge of being a dull ass. A N s
Wales syndicate is alleged to have discovered
a substitute for petrol and applied for •.
patent, which was refused on the ground
apparently, that the disclosure might help
to Lose the War. Baulked in that direction
the interested people then tried to reach I
Bull’s ear through the Defence Department-
but that bright institution declined to disturb
the busy Titan with an invention that was
“worthless.” This decision was followed
by the disappearance of the previous objec-
tions against granting a patent. Thereupon
the inventors secured the needed protection
and asked the Commonwealth Treasury for
permission to float a small co. A heavv
negative blew them out of the door. They
are still standing on the mat, and it is
evidently the intention of the Government
to keep them there. It is said that the
strongest opposition comes from the Defence
Department, which only increases this
paper’s suspicions that the Department is
a graveyard for ideas. There is even con-
siderable evidence that George Foster Pearce
is the Chief Gravedigger. Never having had
an idea in his life, how can that poor man
be expected to see the need for any in others?
“0.K.”: In the revelation of the real
Russia we can see the utter foolishness of
Britain’s foreign policy in the past. Bea-
consfield, Salisbury. Derby and their old
Tory colleagues—all lived on the tradition
of a “Russian menace” and Muscovite “de-
signs on India.” Now we know that huge,
sprawling, dreamy Russia hadn’t a menace
in her constitution, and that the depth of
her designs was a fiction made in Germany
by Bismarck, who had a true measure of the
ignorance of British diplomacy. Germany,
living next door to Russia, has always
known its neighbor’s weakness. At the out-
break of the present war, when Australia
lived in a fool’s paradise of expectation
from the results of “the Russian steam
roller” the local Hun didn’t attempt to con-
ceal his opinion of what the roller was
worth. He knew, but we didn’t. The by-
gone statesmen of Britain had fooled us
with their pretentious ignorance. The old
belief in Ivan’s militarism had been merely
shaken, not upset, by the Japanese war,
and we were persuaded that Russia had
profited by experience to reorganise her
forces and remedy her mistakes. Our mis-
information was mostly made in Germany,
of course. The Asquith Government knew
a good deal of the truth and was only nega-
tively accessory to the public’s delusion.
But what shall be said of Governments that
kept the theory of a Russian menace in the
forefront of their policy and knew abso-
lutely nothing of a German menace which
was being organised under cover of it? Our
ignorance was grounded on the crass stu-
pidity of an aristocratic British Foreign
Office, always selecting the personnel of its
embassies from the easy-going, gullible class
that gathered its notions from Court circles
and put no natural astuteness into the job.
THE RIGHT TIME TO COME HOME.
“ There's father. He always comes home
after ten.”
"So he ought to. Ten drinks are quite
cnough for any man.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An appeal for recruits at Tabulam (N.S.W.) races
resulted in the enlistment of two aborigines and an
Indian.
They sent the message far and wide, the call to arms
shrilled high.
The strikers, idle rank on rank, meandered slowly by.
And Spring had spread her dimpled clouds with
laughter through the sky.
The death was on the stricken field, the strike was
on the town;
But men were wanted at the Front to pull the
German down—
Strong men and true to toil and smite for manhood’s
high renown.
The white man's land was fair to see by plain and
rolling down.
The white man’s war had raised its voice above the
strike in town.
Three stalwarts heard —and two were black and one
was Asian brown.

WORMS—THE SYMPTOMS.
The symptoms of worms are manifold, embracing
not only facial indications and depression of the whole
system, but serious irritation and much distress.
IN VERY YOUNG CHILDREN much of the irri-
tability and fretfulness is often due to the presence
of worms. Restlessness, fitfulness, sudden starts, hard-
ness and fulness of the belly, irregular movement of
the bowels, and excessive secretion of saliva from the
mouth are invariably indications of the irritation
caused by worms.
IN OLDER CHILDREN the 6ame symptoms are
present, but more distinctly defined. Grinding of the
teeth, violent movements of the legs and arms, and
an undue flow of saliva, which causes frequent efforts
to swallow. When awake there is a constant desire
to pick the nose and scratch the irritated parts.
The bowels are irregular, and frequently the move-
ment of the worms causes diarrhoea, alternating with
costiveness. The breath is usually foul, and the
child is languid and peevish. The tongue preter-
naturally red, or alternately clean and covered with
a white, slimy mucus. A short dry cough, frequently
slimy stools (excretion from the bowels) ; emaciation ;
slow fever, irregular pulse; and sometimes convul-
sions. Loss of appetite frequently alternates with a
craving for food. Indeed, the latter symptom is most
pronounced in many cases, and many mothers have
experienced the insatiable appetites of their children
without realising the cause.
WHEN OTHERS’fAILED
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT’’ WORM PELLETS
SUCCESSFUL, STATES NEW ZEALAND MOTHER.
“My son was induced to take Comstock’s ‘Dead
Shot’ Worm Pellets after trying several other so-
called remedies, but to little use,” writes Mrs. E. J.
Peagram, 77 Princes Street. Woolston, Christchurch,
N.Z. “He was suffering with thread worms, and after
a course of this medicine (Comstock’s Worm Pellets)
he was cured from these intestinal parasites. I can
recommend this medicine, knowing myself that it
cured my son, who is now away at the Front fighting
for the Empire.”
INDIFFERENT HEALTH
DUE TO THREAD WORMS. REMEDIED BY
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM PELLETS.
“My son Cedric about two years ago was troubled
with thread worms,” writes Mrs. Ada J. Munro,
Marmor, Queensland. “His sleep was restless; he
frequently woke up screaming when these parasites
were attacking the bowels during his slumbers. His
appetite became precarious—sometimes he could not
obtain sufficient, and at others nothing seemed appe-
tising. I saw Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets
advertised, and decided upon giving them a trial
and following the directions given with the medi-
cine. Cedric soon passed the whole of these thread
worms and became thoroughly restored to health,
his sleep being peaceful and appetite normal. You
may use this testimony if desired. Cedric is seven
years of age.”
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM PELLETS
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation, com-
pounded on a scientific - principle for the eradication
of worms which infest the intestines. They contain
specific properties which destroy the worms but cause
no injury to the stomach or bowels, and do not
weaken the system. The pellets are prepared in
the form of a confection or lolly, have no disagree-
able taste or smell, but, on the contrary, inspire
children to take them as they would an ordinary
lozenge.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The strike having held up racing in Syd-
ney for the best part of a month, the Spiing
meeting of Tattersall’s Club at Rapdwiek on Satur-
day was as grateful as a shower in days of drought.
No trams were running to the ground, but the
public got there all the same —by boot and motor
and cab and cart. And when at the finish it rushed
out to find its way home and leaped eu masse into
everything with a wheel on it, the scene along the
Randwiek-road was like the final phase of the sports
at Hambone Flat multiplied by 56,924. MacShori-
odds walked back on air. There had been seven
races, and in .five the welcome outsider arrived with-
out the slightest apology.
When the Chelmsford Stakes were mentioned the
public unshipped its wad and rushed the Maori-
lander Biplane like suburban citizens catching the
last train home in strike time. There were 18
starters, half of them being nags of high quality.
But that didn’t matter. Two to 1 was the best on
offer against the stranger. That didn’t matter either,
except to anyone who was looking for something
else. And the end of it all was that the good thing
went down with the old familiar thud and the crowd
rent the atmosphere with wails of anguish. Biplane
ran as rotten a race as this page had noticed for
many days. He certainly has a lot of pace, but
either he is an animal of sour temper or he. requires
riding in a fashion very different, from that Hollowed
on Saturday. He jumped quickly off and in a few
strides was in front, fighting with Deeley for his
head, and he continued doing the same thing for
nearly half a mile. At this stage one of the rough
’uns caught him, and though the pair were clear of
the rest the race was over for Biplane. Coming into
the straight half the field swept past while he seemed
undecided whether 'to come on or get off the course
altogether. He was kept going, galloped like a
mule and finished a long way back in the ruck. A
deplorable exhibition that once more gives point
to the warning against paying too much attention to
sensational track work. Biplane had been galloping
over seven and eight furlongs at Randwick in great
style—with feather weights. He may be a fine
sprinter, but before reckoning him a Derby colt
most people will want to see him tried again with
different riding.
Prince Viridis won the Chelmsford after a hard
struggle with Lingle from the distance. Opposite the
stand it looked as if the older horse would get in
front, but the little fellow responded to Bracken's
persuasion with great gameness and reached the'post
with his head just clear. It was a very fine per-
formance, for the colt was not quite at his best, and
makes it as certain as anything connected with horse
can be that the winner will have something to say
in the Derby. The time was 2sec. worse than Sasan-
off registered last year, but Prince Viridis carried
101 b. more weight. Lingle and Cetigne both did
well and should be heard of again a little later on.
The Toff, another Maorilander, was at no stage in
the argument. The imported Theovil, who came into
the Epsom betting a month or two ago, began last
and finishetj at the same place. A slow commence-
ment is no good in an Epsom. But the writer
expects to see this handsome nag one of these days
finishing faster than he did after being galloped on
on Saturday.
Prince Viridis was bred by his owner, “Baron”
Brown, who had a second winner on Saturday, when
the generally-calamitous Wallace Isinglass appro-
priated the Spring Handicap, in which the running
of First Lesson and Bursar was noticeable. Wallace
had been doing well with Prince Viridis on the
track lately. Wherefore he started a hot favorite.
As usual he didn’t seem to care for the business, and
if the agitation of his tail meant anything it was
bad luck for Israel the post happened to be so close.
Bursar started at a long price. He is apparently
getting back to the form of last year.
Of the Epsom horses seen at Tattersall's
meeting on Saturday there were some that behaved
very unobtrusively. There were others that did the
other thing. Of these latter the most emphatic
were Ardrossan, Auberic and Mehi King.. The first
of these, a Featherstich gelding, five years old,
trained bv Mark Thompson, ran clean over every-
thing in the Tramway Handicap, seven furlongs.
This horse won the High Weight Handicap, six fur-
longs, at the A.J.C. Autumn meeting, and in .Tune
ran Clydeside to a head over 1} mile on the same
course. He carried 7st. 21b. on Saturday. His
Epsom burden is 7st. 41b. He will see a mile out
all right. Auberic (Bst. 101 b.). second on Saturday
to Ardrossan, did nearly as well, and by the end of
the month should be a considerably better horse.
When at his best he is mighty hard to beat. Epsom
weight—Bst. 61b. Mehi King, Bst. 21b., was solidly
backed for the Tramway, but, though well placed,
at the top of the straight faded out of the argument.
He has been supported with the right material for
the Epsom, but will have to do a long way better
to land the bacon. Still, the same can be said of a
dozen others, and sudden improvement is not an
uncommon complaint at this time of year.
There were 44 horses ready for the Novice
Handicap at Randwick on Saturday, and for the
first time a race on that course was run in divisions.
Of the six place-getters one was imported and the
others were by imported sires. Incidentally they
included L. K. S. Mackinnon’s Salvini, which did
something for the first time since bringing 1900
guineas as a yearling. He ran third in the first
division. In the other races, including a steeple-
chase, the 15 place-getters were with three excep-
tions either imp. or had imp. on one or both sides
of the pedigree. Imported horses were third in
four events.
Probably Bursar, thoroughly wound up,
would be about the very best horse in the country
tor a two-mile race. He looks great for stamina
and strength. But last year he went amiss in the
winding-up process, and the bitten punters are shy.
By his victory in the Chelmsford Stakes
young Prince Viridis goes up 71b. in the Melbourne
Cup weights, and a Derby win will add another 31b.
This comes very rough on Prince V. He was handi-
capped up to Derby-winning form in the first place,
and every pound over 7st. 61b. will be more than
his dad, Prince Foote, had to carry when he won the
Melbourne Cup.

Young Charlie Barden, who got smashed
up in a tinpot race at Canterbury Park (Sydney)
a few weeks ago, was a loser in more ways than
one. Until he pulls round again Bracken will be
aboard the “Baron’s” horses, and they started
off with a couple of wins at Randwick on Saturday.

“H.0’8.”: Tom Donoghue, of Mudgee
(NSW.), reputed the oldest riding jockey in Aus-
tralia, will have to hand the title on to C. F.
Clifford At Broken Hill last week Clifford booted
his own mare Gratiosa to victory in the handicap
Trial Stakes. Clifford is 65 year's of age. Donoghue
is a mere kid of 63.
Backers of Glad Eye for the two Cups
will be disturbed to find him an acceptor for the
Metropolitan and an entrant for various other events
at the A.J.C. meeting. As regards the Caulfield Cup
the alleged hope of Scobie’s stable could, perhaps,
afford a penalty, for he is let in at 7st. 41b., or 51b.
less than his handicap for the Met.
* * * *
With the petering out of the strike some
of the Victorian horses commenced to reach Randwick
last week, and as the favorites for the Epsom and
Metropolitan (Wedge and Court Jester) come from
over the border, and Thrice is stated to be a genuine
Derby animal, the appearance of this trio has been
received with loud applause. Up to the other day it
was a little doubtful whether Lord Windemere or
Prince Viridis would be the chosen of Barden’s stable
for the Derby, but Saturday’s running settles
the matter. The problem of the Derby with many
people is whether Thrice can stay the journey and
if so whether he can beat the Prince. If he has
developed according to promise he may do both, but
he will have to be as exceptionally good at three
years as he was at two to do it. Meanwhile there
are others in the Derby who have yet to be heard
from on the subject—Bronzetti, Pah King and
Broken Glass for instance.
During the last half-dozen years or so
any three-year-old to run well up in the Chelmsford
Stakes did as well or better in the A.J.C. Derby.
Prince Foote won both events. Beragoon and
Mountain Knight were both second in the Stakes
and each won the Derby of his year. A.nd Wallace
Isinglass, after being second to Carlin in the
Stakes, arrived behind Cetigne in the Derby. But
there was an exception to the general rule last
year. Kilboy ran out of place in the first event
but got away with the Derby afterwards.
Last year’s sensational nag Quinologist
had been consuming oats under the eye of the Law
in Sydney for a long while up till last week, when,
after listening to evidence of various kinds and pro-
longed argument, Justice Duffy made up his mind
and gave judgment. The case turned upon a claim
brought by Albert Cochram (W.A.) against Theodore
Trautwein and David Price (Sydney), alleging fraud
on the part of the defendants. Cochram had been
part owner with Trautwein of the moke, and what
he wanted was cither a declaration that lie was
still a partner or £5OOO damages. The claim was
based upon allegations against Trautwein of having
defrauded Cochram by making a bogus sale to Price
and afterwards buying the horse back as part of the
dummy transaction. The Court gave judgment against
Cochram, and Trautwein emerged a winner. But the
mind of the Court was filled with dark suspicion and
no costs were allowed. There was some fairly hard
lying over some phases of the business, and h’sonor,
after refusing a stay of proceedings, intimated that
if anvone wanted permission to prosecute someone
for perjury he was ready to give a hand. The
Court appeared to look with a cold eye on everybody
except the horse.

“0.K.”: The “Plunger Thompson” re-
ferred to by Billy Emerson in the song (“Could I
Onlv Back the Winner”) that “B.B.” heard him sing
in Maoriland Was probably Joe Thompson, the big-
gest bookmaker of the period—3o years ago. Joe
also owned nags occasionally, and when he backed
’em he had a plunge. He won a fortune when his
Don Juan took the Melbourne Cup. Lance Lenton,
who wrote the ditty, lived in Melbourne and knew
.Toe Thompson by repute, but didn’t know the differ-
ence between a “leviathan” booky and the other
sort of gambler that enjoys the fleeting notoriety
of a “plunger.”
Adelaide’s new P.M., S. .T. Mitchell, is
making a small sensation by a genuine effort to put
down bookmaking, which is illegal in S.A., by
smashing fines, instead of tickling the offender with
a sort of license-fee. “Betting is a business, and I
have to put it down,” he said last week, and in-
creased his previous record of a £3O fine to £4O,
with a hint that he is prepared to go after the
Maoriland record of £l5O.

Of course it is poor sport, but pony-
racing leads to some exciting struggles for the cash.
There was one the other day at Victoria Park (Svd-
ney). At the distance in the Park Handicap Bal-
lanto appeared to have the race w T on ; but in a stride
or two the Trickster ran up into the argument, fol-
lowed by Rouvlet, and the three fought out a gruel-
ling finish. The Trickster was the middle of the
sandwich, and got squeezed out by a whisker: the
other two reached the post together. In the run-off
Rouvlet, the outsider, won easily, and backers of
Ballanto howled like dingoes.
The English thoroughbred Borrow’ (Ham-
burg—-Forget) is reckoned the fastest animal now-
racing in the United States. Before leaving Eng-
land Borrow was raced at two-, three- and four-
years, and recognised as a prad of exceptional endur-
ance. He is now nine years old, and in winning
the Brooklyn Handicap (July) ran the mile and a
quarter in lmin. 49 2-ssec —a world’s record. The
best time for this distance registered
is “521” by Woorak, and in England o 2 4-5 by
Polymelus and Hackler’s Pride. #
Andy Greaves (lOst. B*lb.) went eiose to
upsetting the calculations of Herb McCoy (**>*•
1241 b 1 at Brisbane on Saturday. It looked quids
to a peanut on Herbert till Greaves sent across
an all-but woodener in round three. This
the little cove for live. Greaves s inexperience
thereupon made him miss the chance started
time. McCoy, recovering in a round or two, started
in to chop Mr. Greaves to pieces. At « an

further into the limelight, Andrew was adnsed to
go home. It happened about round 14. *
A couple of fly-weights collided at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday for the State champions p
George Mendies (Vst. 41b.) and Jack Creen ( .
121 b.). Jack is a sturdy little boxer with phmt)
of sand in him, but George smote him oftener than
he could retaliate and that settled the matter. In
contemplating these midgets hurling k.o s about
there is always a feeling that the business might
be more effectively managed by bringing larger
forces into the field. To liberate a dozen J. John-
sons and Jess Willards in a ring would be a fear-
some experiment. But if a score of flyweights
were turned loose on one another it would possibly
be a joyful occasion, with no one seriously damaged
and the conqueror standing at the finish like the
lone survivor on a battlefield whence all but he
had fled. „ ,
“Trot”: To Australians it will always
seem a pity that Darcy and Mike Gibbons were never
brought together. The other day Mike had an mtei-
view with George Chip over 12 rounds. The report
of the meeting shows that Mike gave Chip a boxing
lesson, making him “miss frequently.” Chip won
two or three rounds, and was shaded in the others.
Now, as between Darcy and Chip 12 rounds would
only have been possible on a stall. Chip was cer-
tainly not in the same class as Darcy, and when
the Maitlander knocked him cold in Sydney there
was no doubt of his ability to do it several times a
day all the year through. Taking a line through
anv of the men the two met, Darcy would have hurt
Mike quite a lot —and more* quickly, too, because
Michael is a boxer and not a puncher.
* * * *
“Mat”: Stan Wickham, quoted in a
recent Bulletin argument as the finest of Rugby
kicks, made a first mark at the game with the
Ormond XV at Parramatta (N.S.W.) in the ’9o’s.
He was in knickers then. Later, he pulled on the
N.S.W. blue jersey against Queensland and Maori-
land. When he gave up football he lifted a bat for
Central Cumberland in premiership cricket. In
1910 he was runner-up to H. A. Rumball in N.S.M .
amateur billiard championship. Nowadays a more
rotund Wickham keeps his appetite in repair at
bowls. Know anybody who has done so well in so
many branches of sport?
« * * \ *
Staff-sergeant Aubrey Lock, builder of
the second of Australia’s own aeroplane-engines, is
now in charge of an ambulance-repairing outfit near
the French Front. One of the occupations of the
little plant is the hardening of steel, in which process
crushed bones and chunks of old leather are burned
together to get the desired result, and at. first there
were many inquiries from passing soldiers as to
what the prefume meant. At length Lock rigged up
a notice and nailed it at the forge-door: “Corpse-
factory,” in French and English.
Bulldog-fancier Eric Serman, of Armadale
(Vic.), whose stock has pulled off many prizes on
the bench in years gone by, lately thrust his fingers
through his thinning hair and decided that, after
all, a man is as young as he feels. Now he is some-
where in France with the A.F.C.— not in the air,
being too tough in the wishbone for that, but doing
useful work as a motor-cyclist.
Billjim’s laconics. Three of him with the
“Diamond Division” somewhere in France received a
Melbourne paper containing a picture of two youths
at a seaside picnic, headed “Two Good Sports.”
Whereupon the Billjims Three cut out from the same
journal a photograph of two soldiers in uniform, and
returned it to the sender with the written comment,
“Two Better Sports.”

A pair of lawyers are at the head of the
third unit of the Sportsmen’s Thousand, now being
slowly and somewhat painfully gathered together in
Melbourne. Forrest Davies is one of them. He
enlisted some time ago and has hitched his war-
waggon to a pair of stars in the meantime. The
other is Lieut. Dickson, who belongs to an old Mel-
bourne family which has for years been interested
in the pursuit of Costs.

Maesmore Alfred Morris, who nearly 30
years ago was one of the most promising cricketers
in Victoria, is dead. He played for Vic. against
Ma at Sydney in Jan., ’B9, and made 11 and 0.
Soon afterwards one of his eyes was injured, and he
played the game no more. In that last match N. S.
Wales, set 75 to win, were mown down for 63 by
Hughie Trumble (6 for 33) and Jack Worrall (4
for 19). Trumble was then only a 22-year-old.
Percy McDonnell, Jack Ferris, Tommy Horan, Jack
Edwards and Jack Barrett, five Australian cham-
pions who played in the game, preceded Morris to
the Styx. Morris’s wife, a daughter of the late
Dr. J. J. E. Wilmott, was for a time well-known on
the stage.
The shoulders behind the third N.S.W.
sportsmen’s battalion belong to Lieut. Fred W.
Fifield and Joe Lecky. Fifield is an Australian, born
at Mt. McDonald, near Cowra, and before the war
gong sounded taught young Australia that two and
two don’t make five. In spare hours he played Union
Rugby, tennis and cricket. Lecky forsook the plough
and hoe at Camden to pull on khaki. He owns a
fondness for rowing, cricket and tennis, and an
abnormal appetite for golf.

The Lindrum-Gray billiard match at
Sydney during the past fortnight was a labored
business. Owing to light restrictions in the first
week, the afternoon sessions struggled through in
semi-darkness, and the proceedings knocked the
nerves of both players to pieces. Then the glare
of the light at night unsettled them yet more, so
that to push the affair through in time three se»-
sions per day were necessary. At half-way Lindrum
led by 730—7230 to 6500. Gray livened up in the
second week, and was only 207 behind when the
marker called “16,000.” Gray's best cues were
245 and 244, mostly off the red. Lindrum, besides
running up a fine 267 at the ninth session, and 255
on the last day, scored more than double the cen-
turies of his opponent. The match for the rubber
ought to be more cheerful. The first game, played
in Melbourne, was taken by Gray.

At the N. S. Wales combined High
Schools’ championship meeting at Sydney last week
S. G. Webb (Sydney) put up a schools’ record mile
of smin. 1 3-ssec., and also won the “half” in
2min. 12 4-ssec. K. Compton (East Maitland)
made the greatest disturbance among the sprinters,
winning the 220yds. and dead-heating with Kent-
well in the 100yds. Sydney High School boys over-
took both the junior and senior championship cups.
This years struggles for the champion
ships of N. S. Wales Great Public Schools saw rare
performances. In the sprints, S. G. Moore (Kine’si
satisfied his appetite by winning the io'OvtP
220yds., 440yds. and broad jump, 121 b. shot throw
ins cricket ball and kicking football. R. p’ Criims
(Newington) won the 100yds., 220vds., 440v*ls
broad jump, 120yds. hurdles (which “won him'the
School’s Cup for the fourth year) ; while p i
Heath (C.E.G.S.) won 100yds. (10 3-ssec.), 220 v ls
(23 7-10 sec), 440yds. and 120yds. hurdles. ’ Heath"
whose times were yards better than the other-"
efforts, won the “under 16” All Schools’ 100yds
220yds. and 880vds. championships last year, but
goes up into the “open” class this year. ’ Over
the long stretches R. S. Holcombe (C.E.G.S.), Hall
(King’s), and Orchard (Newington) each won the
880vds. and mile of their schools. These young
Australian scooters come into collision at the bm
championship meeting on September 14.

Young Clarence Power, son of Tom Power
sporting editor of S. M. Herald, had Some queer
experiences in France recently. During a lull in
the fighting he went out with a stretcher party
picking up wounded, and the first he found was
his own brother, a signaller, who had stopped some
ironmongery with his knee. Later on in the day
Clarry did something else and was presented
with the Military Medal. Since then he has been
wounded, and the latest news received about him
is that he and the brother he found are having the
times of their young lives in smoky old London, on
furlough and crutches.

Jim Cassidy, who drew stumps at Bath-
urst (N.S.W.) recently, did something more than
wield the willow and gamble in horseflesh. He
moved off just on the 50th anniversary of his feat
of saving four lives in one day. The Macquarie River
was in flood and the big bridge on the Sydney-
Bathurst-road was carried away. Boat traffic 1 was
substituted, and one of the craft overturned while
attempting the passage. Cassidy, who was riding
along the bank at the moment, jumped into the
river, struggled ashore with one of the submerged,
swam out again three times to where the boat was
pinned against a stump and saved the entire cargo.
Queenio Ball, a miss who still wears her
hair in plaits and attends the Petersham Public
School, may be giving some of the lady sprinters a
view of her back hair before long. Since 1912
she has won every skipping and running champion-
ship under the N. S. Wales P.S.A.A.A., and has
appropriated nearly a score of open events. Her
latest success was in a scratch race at the Empire
sports at Ashfield. Queenie’s fellow students tip her
as a sure winner at the next Olympic Games
girl- are given any sort of a chance.

John Penningtou, a storekeeper from
Bealiba, who fills the Kara Kara seat in the Vic.
Assembly in succession to Peter Mcßride, is helping
Norman' Bayles with his Totalisator Bill. Of the
10 per cent, deduction, the clubs are to get three-
fourths for prize-money and tote-upkeep and the
balance will go to the State; and the bill specifies,
in Parliamentary language, that no bets are to be
made at “tote odds” —which only goes to show what
an ingenuous young sexagenarian Bayles still is.
The second reading is to happen on the 27th inst.,
the day before prorogation.

Though it made no promises to boost up
the War Funds, Vie. Hoofball League has thus far
collected for the two semi-finals £293 more than
last year—£324 for the ’Roy-Carlton game and
£37B' for Saturday’s ’Wood-South match, an attend-
ance of 16,463 yielding this latter sum. The game
was pleasing uo to half-time, especially through the
efforts of promising youngsters; but the latter part
of the episode degenerated into a Southern rout,
’Wood ultimately winning by 95 points to 35. By
downing Carlton on the previous Saturday, Roy.
which had only squeezed into the finals by being
half-a-game better than Geelong, will have the joy
of being walloped in the final by ’Wood, which to-
day boasts about the most effective combination
ever seen in the Cabbage Garden. What the blokes
who have spent 1000 days toying with a different
sort of ball think of the thing is another matter,
and can’t be discovered just now.

MOST Horseman experience difficulty in
obtaining breeches that are absolutely
faultless as to fit. There is so often some minor incor-
rectness in the cutting that renders the garments uncom-
fortable in wear and possibly shortens the period of
their serviceability. For instance, have not YOU had
breeches that were just a little too tight at the knee with
the consequence that difficulty was experienced when
mounting or the stitching gave way just as the strain was
put on the left knee?
“L.S.” Breeches are cut by men experienced in the production
of Riding Garments—men who know exactly how Breeches
must be cut to be completely satisfactory. We quote our special

To write off accumulated Sydney adminis-
tration exes., £1326; to write down capital
expenditure (including plant) £1387; to
pay cumulative prefs. 12 p.c. for one year,
£1566 (assuming the dividend was payable
for a full year on the whole of the pref.
capital shown in the balance-sheet, which is
doubtful) ; balance forward, £946. The cum.
pref. capital is now £13,057, and about 50
p.c. accumulated dividend is still payable.
“Should the price of rubber remain equal to
that of last year,” the directors say, “the
profit of the current year should be sufficient
to pay off the whole amount.” There is no
strong reason to expect any serious fall in
the price of rubber, which seems to have
about reached its level.
The co.’s estate, which is leasehold, con-
sists of 1193 acres, handy to Kuala Lumpur,
the rubber centre of the Malay Peninsula.
The planted area is 802 acres, and the co.’s
plans provide for adding 50 acres and felling
the other 300 acres of jungle in the current
year, and having the whole estate planted
by the end of 1918, the object of the rush
being to secure from the Government, which
is apparently the lessor, certain statutory
rebates. The labor difficulty doesn’t afflict the
F.M.S. cos. to the same extent as it does the
Islands planters: most of the labor force are
Tamils, with Chinese for special work, and
there is a handy supply for rush
jobs. Last year’s rubber crop was
135,6581 b., which bettered the estimate
by over 44,0001 b.: and the estimate
for the current year is 223,0001 b. Last
year’s lot realised a fraction under 2s. net,
and cost Is. 6-id., which is quite an outside
figure; the management puts it at Is. Id. for
the current year, and that is about a fair
thing for a young plantation. A profit of
lid. on the current year’s estimate would
show a profit of a shade over £lO,OOO. And
there should be a steady increase for about
10 years. The ordinary capital is £28,403,
with £13,057 pref.; total, £41,460. The
prefs.’ 12 p.c. means a big bite; but given
fair luck —no smash in the market, reason-
able freedom from disease and no destruc-
tive storms- —the co. seems now to have got
on to a good wicket. The co. has no debts
to speak of (they are more than balanced by
liquid assets), and at £44,008 the estate
stands in the books at a very reasonable
figure, considering the improvements and the
five or six years’ accumulation of charges.

There you have the effect of six o’clock
closing: a smaller net profit than in any of
the previous 19 years. Restricted trading
hours have meant decreased brewings and
reduced rentals from hotel properties; and
meantime extra taxation and manufacturing
costs are also cutting into profits. Brew-
eries and Bung are having the worry of their
lives; so in the three eastern capitals they
have combined to do they don’t know quite
what. Says the Melbourne beer-union’s
president:—
It has been found by licensed victuallers that any
arrangement that they came to as to prices was not
observed —that- there was always a certain percentage
who broke away and destroyed any scheme. The
licensed victuallers approached the brewers and asked
them to adopt a firm scheme so that the great
majority would be protected from the “cutter” and
the exploiter in the trade. The only benefit which
the brewers got out of this was that they knew their
customers were thereby making a fair profit, and
that in consequence they were dealing with solvent
people.
Also “licensed victuallers recognise that the
price of beer has to be increased.” So each
brewery customer is now invoiced at a much
higher rate than he has been paying of late,
and he secures a rebate only by making a
statutory declaration each month that he has
charged full union prices and used the
standard-sized mugs, etc. All this indicates
the present condition of the trade.
As for Fitzgerald’s, it is in a better posi-
tion than most breweries to take a jolt or
two. During the boom times it kept to its
vats in Castlemaine, and did not rush in to
purchase city pub properties at inflated
prices. Still, there have been changes in
the past 10 years:—
1907. 1915. 1916. 1917.
Capital .. . . £60,000 £60,000 £60,000 £60,000

Tradeaccountbalauce 9,149 8,793 9,077 7,339
Expenses . . . . 2,122 2,069 3,309 2,134
In 1907 the co. had £18,949 invested in
hotels and £12,343 in mortgages; but its
faith in the pint-pot has increased its hold-
ing of pub properties to £42.591, whilst mort-
gages now total only £lOOO. Whether it
was wise to put so much spare cash in beer
emporiums depends entirely on trading re-
strictions when normal times return. On
present appearances six o’clock will be a
permanent infliction. The present dividend
is really better than it looks. The original
capital of £40.000 has in 15 years been in-
creased by two transfers of £lO,OOO from
reserves, so to old holders at par the return
is actually 12 p.c.

BOOTS have come back again and no mistake.
But such dreams of boots, up-to-date,
dainty, delightful, fit accompaniment to the
flounced taffeta frocks of the day, which
combine smart modernity with old-world charm.
Paris and London both are now tripping to work
and play in short-fronted, high-heeled, suede-
topped boots like the Bostock style here lllus
trated. , . , ~
It is a smart little boot, there is no doubt
about that, and every bit as comfortable as it is
smart. The beautifully fitting last on which it is
made sees to that, and lots of women, who have
never imagined thev could wear a short-fronted
style, will be amazed to find how comfortable it
is, how jolly it makes their feet look.
Then for those who want something different,
who prefer shoes perhaps, there is a fine range of
styles to select from, all as up-to-date and charm-
ing as this model, and all safe to wear well and
feel as peculiarly one’s own as if they had been
made to measure.

Britain, being hard up for tanning sub-

juicy pickings for S’Africa, to which Aus-
tralia presented this industry, being satis-
fied itself to live on loans. For a good while
S’Africa has been shipping the crude bark*to
America, India, Russia, Japan and other
places, not to mention an ounce or two to
Australia; now factories are pushing the
extract side of the biz., which should have
been ours; too —and would have been ours if
we hadn’t been afflicted with the borrowing
curse, which is at the root of nearly all our
woes.

SERmTION OF ENERGY AND THE TRANSMISSION OF POWER
Klingtite Beits Need No Dressing
The superior friction surface of a
Klingtite Belt is the best possible dressing
a belt can have.
Combating belt slippage with patented
dressings is like fighting a typhoid epidemic
with medicines only, instead of purifying the
water and milk of the community.
Belt slippage should be corrected at the
source —the source is the belt construction.
The superior friction of Klingtite Belts
grips the pulleys and insures efficient trans-
mission.
It does more.
It insures long, continuous life for the belt.
Its thickness, its toughness, its pliability
assure you of longer service per £ s. d. of cost
than you can hope to get from any other belt.
And long life is further assured bv the
special-weave duck used by Goodyear having
a tested tensile strength 25% greater than
the best generally used in transmission belts.
Into the very fibre of this duck the
friction is forced under regulated pressure.
In this way the plies in Klingtite belt-
ing are indissolubly welded and ply separation
practically made impossible, while maximum
pliability is secured.
And pliability means greater pulley
contact and consequent greater efficiency in
transmission.
So —it is another reason for not need-
ing dressing on Klingtite Belts.
Of course dressing is cheap in itself.
But it is not cheap when you consider
that even the best dressing, although it
temporarily increases efficiency, is bound to
decrease the hie of the belt.
But the friction of Klingtite Belts
increases efficiency and increases length ol
service as well. , ",
And the quality of Goodyear Klingtite
Belts remains the same, no matter what the
price of materials and labor.
I hey are the best transmission Kelts
you can use, and a trial will prove this fact.

Everyone needs a Kodak for making records.
Parents need a Kodak for keeping records of the

for exciting moments; travellers for interesting
scenes and people.

A GRAND SlX—£39o
A GRANT SIX owner writes:
“In regard to the running
of the ear, I think you are
well justified in calling it ®
‘GRAND SIX.’ I have found
it so.
“Recently I had occasion to
do 57 miles after an inch and
a half of rain in the Black
Soil Plains. I found one car
hogged and abandoned, and
another started out.
turned back. My GKA- .
however, went through, ant
was the only car to do the
trip that day.

and did 40 miles in great

IN BANANA LAND
This year’s fat-bullock gamble at Bris-
bane Show prostrated all previous efforts.
The dressed beast scaled 9601 b.. and 11
guessers sized up the correct weight. Four
of the 11 were womenfolk —another broad
hint that man’s domain has lost another
acre.
Hughes becomes more and more Gilbert-
ian. At the height of the railway strike he
threatened to put Premier Ryan in gaol.
Rut as the little man hasn't a gaol of his
own he would have had to put Ryan in
Ryan’s gaol, with the key in Ryan’s pocket.
“M.F.” : Billjim’s vote on the Fossils ref-
erendum has not yet arrived, and the return
of the writs has been extended for the
second time iu the hope that the package
will have dodged the U-boats. But even if
the papers don’t turn up it is not likely that
Ryan will risk another appeal to the electors
on the subject.
“Myall”: Pastoralists in the Mitchell dis-
trict are at present having a bad time with
caterpillars. On one station 80 head of
cattle have died as a result of dining on the
worms. The pest has a red head, green
body, with a spiked tail, and is about an
inch long. They appear on the leaves of the
ironbark trees, and stay up aloft until every
leaf has been eaten. Then they make for
the ground, and at the trunk of the tree the
cattle eat them. Stock live only a few days
after the banquet. L
lenry Willis, one-time Speaker of the
N. S. Wales Assembly and now proprietor
of a quantity of brigalow scrub and a net-
ting fence in the vicinity of Roma, is the
selected Labor candidate for the Maranoa.
The Nationalists and the Farmers’ Union
are both running a candidate, thus splitting
the anti-Labor vote and making it look a
good tiling for Willis. Tom Spencer, of
Roma, who was elected on the Liberal
ticket some years ago, is the Nationalist
candidate.
The Bulletin meets a new friend on the
Inky Way —The Link, whose object it is to
get hold of Bananalanders at the Front and
at home and bind the two bundles together.
And a very good job editor Billjim (returned)
is making of it —sending it out in the form of
a narrative letter to the chaps along the
battle lines, written smartly, mostly about
the girls and what the slackers are not doing
and the small things of the family circle.
Answered the last Roll Call at Brisbane
the other day, Sergt. Fred T. Denecke, who
had been 44 years in the local military
forces, having joined up when he was 18.
llis father was a foundation member of the
Brisbane volunteer forces. When Bill began
to move across Belgium Denecke rushed into
the recruiting office, but as he couldn’t chop
a sufficient number of years off his age he
was given home-service work. He held the
long-service medal and the Queensland record
for the longest continuous service in the
same regiment.
“Ashton.” about the good old days: —
The mode of payment of aboriginals as it operated
on parts of the Culgoa is, alas, beyond recall. 1
remember a crowd of Binghis that had been scalping
and shooting on the run, and barring meagre sup-
plies of rations and opium had received nothing.
One morning the whole tribe was waiting outside the
office, and when the boss opened the door Jimmy the
spokesman stepped up on the verandah and exploded:
“Look here, Misser Mac, scalpin’ eight week now —
no money. We know how many bean make five. We
want ’im settlement!” “Yes, yes,” said the boss.
“Always willing to meet you,” and swinging a chair
he hit the spokesman over the “cobra.” Then twirl-
ing his persuader with murder in his eye he said to
the deputation: “If no other gentleman wants a
settlement I’ll bring out the rum.” The rum was
carried unanimously.
THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT DIFFERENTLY.
VISITOR: “I notice you are never idle. You always pick up your knitting when I come
to see you.”
HOSTESS: “Oh, yes, I can't hear masting time.”
Passed away on August 80, Corporal
James Watt Macgregor, of Waroolaba,
Harrisville. After 19 months with the
A.I.F. in Egypt end on Headquarters staff
in London, he was invalided home in May
last; but privations in Egypt, followed by
intense cold in England, were too much for
him. In the old days of peace he managed
Mount Morris station, Charleville, and Ter-
rick Terrick, Blackall. There’s a wife and
one son to weep for him.
The parents of Sergt. S. J. Hill, of Bris-
bane, were proud people the other day when
news came through that he had got a star.
The boy himself was prouder of a card from
General Holmes congratulating him on his
courage and devotion to duty at Messines in
June last —just before the General was
killed. Young Hill left Brisbane as a pri-
vate in June. 1915. and all his promotions
came on the field. Twenty next month.
After three years’ strenuous work as
chairman of the Brisbane district of the
A.J.A. Fred Bryan has made way for
Norman Freeburg. Some solid thanks were
passed over to Bryan the other night be-
tween sodas.
Exit Frederick William Gray, known on
the Point as Denbigh Newton. Never
married, he came to Australia from London
in 1885, appearing with Genevieve AY aid in
“Antigone” at the Melbourne Town Hall. He
played comedy with Brough and Boucieault
at the Bijou, was afterwards with a Gilbert
and Sullivan opera co., and did much tour-
ing with Grattan Riggs. Tu 1889 he settled
in Queensland as a teacher of elocution, and
later was in Brisbane city engineer s office.
The dusk was spent at Vic. Old Colonists
Homes, which he entered in Aged 76.
“B.” : Re the dangers that lurk in the sea
carriage of copra (B. 28/8/10- The Suva
Chamber of Commerce has urged the Fijian
Government to take steps to make if a penal
offence to adulterate dry coeoanut meal by
adding sand, salt water or fresh water.
Safety to a carrier depends on the article
being shipped in a perfectly dry state, and
if it is being damped to add weight by the
untutored savage, then most of the copra
fires are explicable. Incidentally, it is only
a fair tiling that the Fijian Government
should be the first to take action, because
Fijian copra is notoriously badly cured.
“Ashton” : At Roma, whilst listening to a
Salv’army performance. I saw a lassie bring
down the street with a hymn, “The Saviour
is a Bosker.”
Reported that Dr. Michaelis, German
Chancellor, has been forced by the Reichstag
to appoint a Hun bai’on as sub-editor of the
Kaiser’s speeches. Is battered Germany at
last refusing to answer its Wilhelm?
“Trench”: My experience is that the
manual worker will kick against a humane
and wisely-arranged time-saving system
where he tamely knuckles under to the bully
who is out to sweat him for his private gain.
I once took a job shovelling with a gang.
We had as pacemaker a big buck navvy of
enormous strength. The ganger walked up
and down watching every man’s shovel.
“Up to the maker’s name or out!” he roared
whenever he caught some poor devil lagging.
There was no grading of shovels such as
Taylor recommends on that job. We all
used the same size as the pacemaking giant,
and if you couldn’t fill them “up to the
maker's name” out you went.
“Looker-on”: Is the Australian character
changing? Years ago the Australian had
leg that was hard to pull. But he reckoned
the day wasted if he met a “newchnm” ,
didn’t take him down by gettini him t'
swallow an outrageous snake-yarn
that seems to have changed, judging 'k v h,
way the unions have been collared and
being used by newchums for the ml*
gigantic leg-pull poor Australia has ovll
suffered. YY hat sort of humorless fool k
man who, while comfortably emploved 'hi
himself , drops his tools at the bidding 0 f
crazy stranger and describes himself in
dreary imported song as “a wage-slave”?
“The Snake” : Jones stopped me and. with
an anxious expression, said. “Well, how lon-
is this damned fighting going to last?”
haven’t the least idea,” I answered; “but we
seem to bo getting the best of it in Fraud
and Italy and” The look that spread
over his face stopped me short. “Oh the
war!” he exclaimed petulantly. “Dash’/W
—no: the STRIKE!” Which reminded me
of the one who met the other vigorous!?
legging it out along the footway in London
“And where away so fast to-day?” the ~n , ;
asked. “To the House of Commons.” ro .
plied the other impatiently. “What!” said
the first, with a yawn, “does that -o a,,
still?”
From the gallery :
Temporary dislikes are hardening into lusty
enmities in the House of Reps., and Speaker Johnson
will require more vigilance to check the flow of
opprobrium. Higgs’s charge of ratting, which
caused him to be temporarily extinguished the other
day, was only a modest posy rescued from the traffic
of bouquets across the Chamber. Most of the
epithets are beyond the aural range of the Policeman
in the Chair, and the worst escape censure because
they are delivered behind a barrage of respectable
interjections. But an attentive listener can usuallv
learn enough to start a History of Polite Conversa-
tion. From the rougher sort of politician references
to members’ personal appearance are frequent, while
the more urbane fire jeers with a Chesterfieldian
grace which doubles their malignity. But none, so
far, have eclipsed Hughes’s classic: “You have a
mind like a toad in a cesspool,” which was shot at
Higgs a few days ago. This pleasantry, which sur-
passes the daintiest Baudelairean mote of Tummy
Bent, gave the Speaker a chance to show his meticu-
lous care for the strict letter of the gibe. Johnson
■solemnly made Hughes withdraw his reflection on
the mind of Bill Higgs—seemingly the rest of
William didn’t matter.
“M.P.A.”: Beaumont Smith has struck a
winner in his “Hayseed” picture. During
the week that the story of wire-whiskers
was unfolded at Brisbane Pav. the movie
house in Queen-street put up a record. The
first series of the film was made up in Adel-
aide, the second was got together in Syd-
ney. and the third has kept Smith busy in
Brisbane. The Queensland series is full of
variety, as it touches on the farm, an agri-
cultural show and a bush sports-meeting,
besides supplying street views, with good
clean comedy and a neat little love-
story. The other Sunday the pictur"
actors- took possession of a little sub-
urban station on the Pinkenba line for
“the arrival of the Governor and suite."
The entire neighborhood turned up and let
the Sunday dinner spoil while they joined in
the fun. Several well-known comedians
donned hayseed clobber for the occasion, and
Seigenberg, of Sydney, cinoed the fooling.
Sunset from Elldon Hill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
God smoothed this hill with His hand
And left on it not one tree,
And then at the changing sunset hour
God lent the hill to me.
And over its rolling summit
On a color-seeking quest
I saw the gods of Olympus
Ride out of the blazing west.
If Jason had looked on the golden fleece
That was scattered across the sky
He would have banished his Argonauts
And straightway learned to tlx ;
And away on the Sandgate reaches
And over the ti-tree swamp
A vestal maid in a pale green gown
Had lighted an orange lamp.
Low down there were shreds of purple
And delicate lemon shades;
The Twilight friar in his hooded cloak
Was blessing those Pan-filled glades:
As leapt from the tiny holdings
An earth-light here and there.
The world was a burst of Pagan song
With an undertone of prayer!

The Knight Type Engine
Improves With Use
From the nature of their construc-
tion, all ordinary types of motor car
engines will deteriorate with use.
But the Knight type sleeve-valve
engine actually improves with use.
It is the only engine that makes
beneficial use of carbon.
Ever since the petrol engine came
into general use, carbon has been con
sidered an unavoidable evil that gradu-
ally undermined engine efficiency.
It caused loss of powei, made engines
noisy, made valve grinding and cylin-
der cleaning a necessity that period-
ically put one’s car into the repair shop.
But instead of unseating the valves,
carbon seals the fit of the sliding sleeves
of the Willys-Knight engine.
So instead of a loss there is a gain
in power, smoothness, quietness and
flexibility.
Let us tell you more about the ex-
clusive advantages of the Willys-Knight
engine. Let us show you why this car,
with all its luxury, completeness and
riding comfort is priced far lower than
any other Knight “motored” can

RAMESES UNSHRINKABLE
( Trade mark )
Genuine
British
“It AMESES”
Garments
all bear
this mark.
“RAMESES”
FOR SERVICE
and ECONOMY.
UNDERWEAR.
R AMESES UNDERWEAR is the new popular-priced brand
of under-garments for men and women, placed on the
market to enable British people to get an out-and-out Brit-
ish article at the price of and in the place of the German-made
underwear with which until recently this country was flooded.
Rameses Underwear is cheap only as regards its price; in points
of fit and finish, of wear and quality, it reaches a standard never
hitherto found in underwear of equal price. Rameses, like Britain
herself, is absolutely to be trusted.
Wearers of Rameses Garments will find that their comfort and
satisfaction have been most carefully studied; they will find
nothing skimped or slipshod; every genuine Rameses Garment is
designed for honest, enduring service.
Already you can obtain Ramoses in a variety of garments for men
and women, and shortly Raineses Underwear will be obtainable for
children. If you believe in British goods for Britishers, see that
the Rameses trade mark is on the next underwear you buy.
The secret of the value of Rameses Underwear lies in enormous buying of raw material, newest labor*
saving machinery, and long experience and knowledge of manufacture. Rameses Garments aie soft and
“springy” to the last —they keep their size, for they are made their size (not stretched thereto). The
flat seams add greatly to comfort.

it to be; and the vast number of testimonials
received prove it to be. It positively draws the
poisons which produce these ailments out of the
system. As an aperient and blood purifier the
Grasshopper Pills are equally effective, and should
be taken in conjunction with the Ointment. Sold

Don’t Have Grey Hair.
A simple, old-fashioned, home-made recipe will
make the greyness disappear.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily-
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless
manner. You have only to get two ounces
of tammalite concentrate from your chemist
and mix it with three ounces of bay rum to
prove this. Apply this simple and harmless
lotion for a few nights to the hair with a
small sponge and the greyness will gradually
disappear. The lotion is neither sticky nor
greasy, and has been proved over and over
again for generations past bv those in posses-
sion of the formula. —Apyt.

Self-Poisoning
IT is easy to get constipated. It is easy to let
yourself stay constipated. It may seem a matter
of little consequence to you.
Yet any doctor will tell you that the poisoning ol
the system by the products of constipation is one of
the most dangerous conditions to which mankind
is subjected.
Dull headaches, listlessness, sallow complexion,
intestinal troubles—all of these are signs of self*
poisoning, which weakens the system and exposes
you to the inroads of disease.
You can prevent and relieve constipation by the
use of Nujol, the natural laxative which is now
recommended by leading physicians the world
over as the safe and sure treatment for constipation.
Nujol is not absorbed by the system but acts as
an internal lubricant.

Julius Knight has been visiting his people
in Scotland, and in a letter to a Melbourne
friend announces that he is going to do his
bit of Avar work by helping to gather the
harvest. Doubtless lie will design a becoming
costume for the part. Jules says that he lias
not given up his idea of staging “A Royal
Divorce” in N’Yark; he is merely waiting
until the time seems ripe.
“Copy Boy”: To anyone with a fairly
extensive experience of police-courts there
is nothing unbelievable in Dogberry's blun-
dering stupidity; good old British Justice is
often just such an ass. I have a vivid recollec-
tion of one Vic. Jay Pay pointing to the words
Ifoni soi, etc., on the coat of arms above the
bench. “D’ye know what those there words
mean?” he demanded of the prisoner; and
proceeded to translate: “’E ’oo does wrong
'as got to suffer for it!” The unconvincing
thing is that a type so essentially English
as Dogberry should be offered as an inhabi-
tant of old Messina. But it is doubtful if
Shakesbacon ever expected us to accept the
characters in “Much Ado” as real Sicilians,
any more than (filbert Avished us to regard
those in “The Mikado” as real Japs.
Oscar Asclie’s “Chu Chiu Chow” has
broken all records at London Majesty's: it
has passed its 400th performance and is still
going strong. The house record was till now
held by Beerbohm Tree's production of
“Henry VIII.,” Avhich was done 254 times.
“Nemo”: The Poverty par. about W.
Howard Smith and his old “Maritana” pro-
gramme set me turning over my own collec-
tion. The first of “Maritana” is a pro-
gramme of April 3, 1878, when Arrnes Beau-
mont was taking a benefit at Melbourne Opera
House, and had the part of Don Caesar de
Bazan. Fanny Simonsen was the Maritana.
The second part of the bill was “La Peri-
cliole,” in which Clara Thompson was the
Perichole and her husband. Henry Bracy,
the Paquillo. In June of 1885) I saw "Mari-
tana’’ again. Beaumont was still the Don
Caesar; and once more, in April, 1880, at
the Opera House. Here’s another old one:
“Maritana.” by Dunning’s Opera Co., and
the Montague-Turner Opera Co. at the Opera
House, September, 1883. I av.us there, and
heard the plain-faced Annis Montague sing
like an angel as Maritana, and her burly
husband, Charlie Turner, do the Don.
“Fax”: Brough and Boueieault’s "Much
Ado about Nothing,” put on 25 years ago,
was a beautiful production: but there was
not quite the Shakspearean bite in it that
Oscar Asche gave to his shows. Richly
garbed and intelligent comedians filled the
parts with a somewhat modern air in most
cases. Titheradge and Mrs. Brough hardly
suggested a Benedick and Beatrice of the
16th century ; and Emma Temple, as Hero,
Avas less convincing than her tAvo attendant
gentlewomen, Emma (1 wynne and Hilda
Spong. Cecil Ward as Claudio and Percy
Lyndal (Don Pedro) gave the impression of
modern young men in masquerade, whilst
Edward Sass, as gl< xmiy Don John, had tin-
wrong turn of the tongue for blank verse.
They were graceful actors, but their style
Avas not broad enough for ancient comedy.
Brough’s Leonato and the Friar of A. It.
LaAvrenee were about the best on the serious
side, and George Anson and Cannam (first
appearance in Australia) made a satisfac-
tory Dogberry and Verges. Anson was ex-
pected to be a supremely funiiy Dogberry,
but fell short of the ideal. Dion Boucicault
stayed out of the cast to give all possible
care to the stage-management. Boucicault
stuck at nothing in the way of expenditure
on the mounting of this costly show, or in
the treatment of the lines. lie was no
cranky stickler for the original text. If a
line was object'd to as being more or less
indecent, or if the meaning seemed obscure,
or the joke was puerile and'the line could be
dispensed Avith, Boucy’s recipe Avas always
the same —“Cut it out.” His idea Avas to
make the play go AA'itli a public that would
giA’e no thought to obsolete terms and
phrases, and he did make it go -for 1—
weeks.

of Sydney, has not accepted an engagement

a simple remedy
If you have no
need only get
ibout an ounce from your chemist and add
just sufficient water to dissolve it. A little
of this simple lotion is Nature’s own beauti-
fier. It is very good for the skin and in-
stantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lasts all day or evening, renders powder-
ing entirely unnecessary, and absolutely
defies detection.
C COSMETICS can never really help a poor
J complexion ; often they are positively
harmful. The sensible, rational way is to
actually remove the thin veil of stifling,
half-dead scarf skin from the face, and give
the fresh, vigorous and beautiful young skin
underneath a chance to show itself and to
breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way,
by merely applying mercolised wax at night,
like cold cream, and washing it off in the
morning. It absorbs the disfiguring cuticle
gradually and harmlessly, leaving a brilliant
natural complexion. Of course, this also
takes with it all such facial blemishes as
red blotches, tan, moth patches, sallowness,
liver spots, etc. As a freckle remover and
general complexion beautifier this old-
fashioned remedy is unequalled.

A. tablet of stymol, obtained from the chem-

Secrets of Beauty
The Cream of Modern Beauty Advice
By “MIMOSA.”
When the effervescence has subsided the face
is bathed with the stymol-charged water and
then dried with a towel. The offending
blackheads, of their own accord, come right
off on the towel, the large oily pores imme-
diately contract and efface themselves natu-
rally. There is no squeezing, forcing or any
drastic action. The skin is left uninjured,
smooth, soft and cool. A few such treat-
ments should be taken at intervals of three
or four days thereafter in order to ensure
the permanence of the pleasing result so
quickly obtained.^
BEAUTIFUL hair adds immensely to
the personal magnetism of both men
and women. Actresses and smart women
are ever on the look-out for any harmless
thing that will increase the natural beauty
of their hair. The latest method is to use
pure stallax as a shampoo on account of
the peculiarly glossy, fluffy and wavy effect
which it leaves. As stallax has never been
used much for this purpose it comes to the
chemist only in sealed original packages,
enough for twenty-five or thirty shampoos.
A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax gran-
ules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair, apart
from its beautifying effect.
IT is astonishing the number of women
who suffer front the humiliating afflic-
tion of superfluous hair, and I am sorry to
say that through ignorance or wrong treat-
ment the majority of them have made matters
considerably worse by causing the hairs to
grow more quickly and stronger than before.
It only requires a little thought to realise
the folly of it all. Removing the surface
growth for a few days may give temporary
relief, but in order to obtain permanent
results the hair roots must be killed. Caustic
depilatories are worse than useless, and on
no account should the hairs be pulled out.
Apart from the electric needle, which is a
costly and painful process, any chemist will
tell you that the best home treatment is
pure powdered pheminol. which has a de-
vitalising effect upon the hair roots, in addi
tion to which it removes all trace of t. e
objectionable hair in a few seconds, and the
recommended treatment _ gradually, but
surely, dissolves out the hair follicles, which
is the only method of permanently ridding
oneself of this terrible disfigurement. Lb
The Inky Way.
“87”: Yes, the German 'is a thorough
brute. When Abdul evacuated El Arish he
left behind thousands of copies of a German
newspaper containing large-type headings
such as “20,000 British captured on Western
Front” ; “Russians Retiring” ; “Big Strike in
Australia,” all obviously prepared and
printed specially for the consumption of
Thomas and Billjim. An enemy who attends
to details like that commands respect.

“E.5.8.T.”: “Keep it out of the papers” is
the appeal of nine out of 10 Australian
soldiei’s who have done anything. In writing
home the request is made by practically all.
“It looks rotten when it’s read over here,” is
the common excuse. The least bit of skite
and a fellow gets nothing, I promise you.
A man looks such as ass when one of the
fellows props himself up in a crowd of us
and coldly reads an Australian paragraph
bragging about something he has pulled off.
The chances are nine out of 10 in the crowd
have done something better that hasn’t been
named. In fact, there’s a growing feeling
among the lads to edge decorations away on
the inside of a tunic. “I’m not going to do
anything to make anybody believe I’m better
than ten thousand better men who’ve got
nothing,” said one decorated boy the other
day. Great cobbers these Australians —and
I say it though I’m one of them myself.

“Korimako” : Bill Lane, just dead, was the
eighth editor of Auckland (M.L.) Herald.
The first, David Burn, began to instruct the
democracy in November, 1863, wheix the
paper was founded by his partner, W. C.
Wilson. Burn’s health gave way, and F. J.
von Stunner succeeded him. Next was R. J.
Creighton, who later on took up press work
in ’Frisco. Then came James Bi-own, and
he was succeeded in 1875 by William Berry,
who carried on for 28 years. Associated
with Beri’y for about 18 months, after the
amalgamation of the Herald and Southern
Cross, was D. M. Luckie, who resigned to
join the M.L. Life Insurance Department.
When Berry died in 1903, W. S. Douglas,
sub-editor, became editor, and on his death
four years ago Lane took control. All these
men, I think, have passed West. Berry’s
exit was the most dramatic. One genial
October afternoon, having written an article,
he put his pen away saying “I’ve finished.”
An hour or so later he was dead.

“Constant Feeder”: I couldn’t see through
the Russian darkness until Sydney D.T.
fired this star shell in its August 31 leader:
By next Spring, as far as Russia is concerned,
things may be better or they may be worse. As far
as can be seen from this distance anything may
happen. And the most expectable thing is perhaps
the unexpected thing.
Now if one thing is clearer than any other
thing it is that everything is as clear as
anything.
“Quarter Single”: At Canterbury (Vic.)
there is an old Mrs. A. Wheaton, whose
father was James Cook —a collateral
descendant of Captain Cook, of the
Endeavor. In 1852 James and his two
brothers left Yorkshire for Australia, bring-
ing with them a small printing-press and
some knowledge of the trade. As the sailors
deserted as soon as the vessel reached Sand-
ridge, the Cooks —there were not too many
of them to spoil the broth —had to beach
their own goods, which they pulled in a dray
to the shed in Collins-street where they
were to sleep. James bought a Clydesdale
draught-horse at Keilor for £l5O, and the
trio set sail for Bendigo. Business boomed,
and when the father came out later he
brought a larger Howe press. William
Henry Cook took William Sherbon into
partnership, the other two brothers with-
drawing. The partners founded The Ben-
digo Advertiser and Sandhurst Commer-
cial Circular, the first copy of which bears
this imprint:—
Printed by Win. Hy. Cook and Wm. Sherbon, at
their Premises, Bendigo Flat, Bendigo Gold Field;
and Published bv R. R. Haverfield, at his Premises,
View Point, all being in the township of Sandhurst,
on Friday, Dec. 9, 1853.
William Henry Cook afterwards died while
rounding the Horn on his return to Eng-
land ; his widow married Sir W. Leng, of
the Sheffield Telegraph. Cook saw the
Bendigo Advertiser through the Crimean
War; Alfred May, as printer of the Argus,
saw that paper through the Franco-Prussian
War; his son married Mrs. Wheaton’s
daughter, and as printer of Melbourne
Herald is arranging that paper’s blasti-
ferous headings about the Kaiser. Old Bob
Haverfield was still connected with the Adver-
tiser as proof-reader up to 30 years ago;
and Tom lvelynaek, of the Melbourne
Herald, got his first job in a newspaper
office “holding copy” for the old man.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The tradesman at the poet’s door
Was red with righteous ire.
A thumping- sheaf of bills he bore.
Said he: “I’ve 1 served it oft before.
This sort of thing would tire
The patience of old Job. Are we
To l>ill you to eternity ?”
The poet on the tradesman smiled.
“Why should you mind,” said he,
“If 1 do not? I am not wild.
Indeed, I am quite reconciled.
Send in your bills to me.
I find them excellent anon
To rough-cast little poems on.”

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth' as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes. crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

REXONA.
Nothing prettier has ever been seen in
Australia than the mysterious bush scene
in “The Bunyip Pantomime” in which
Miss Maisie Pollard sings the haunting
refrain, “Bunyip, Bunyip, what is it?”
to a nestling group of Australian chil-
dren, one of whom, little Joan, left, behind
on the darkening stage, repeats the query
in a baby treble to the enthralled audi-
ence. Miss Pollard loves Australia, and
hastens to praise a good Australian
article. She writes:— .
“A friend of mine uses your
Rexona for her little baby—the
only son. Watching her bathing
him, and knowing how particular
she is about everything she uses for
him I asked her the name of the
Soap. That was three years ago.
Since that date I have also become
a Rexona devotee. It is a perfect
Skin Soap. It is as fine for children
as for the hair and complexion of
grown-ups. Rexona Ointment is
equally good—it will heal any-
thing.
“Wishing Rexona the success it
deserves.
“Vours faithfully
“(Sgd.) MAISIE POEEARD.”
The Rexona Remedies
consist of Rexona,
tlie Rapid Healer, and
Rexona Skin a n d
Facial Soap. They
are universal favorites
av i t h everyone av h o
values a pure and
healthy skin. Rexona
Avill at once heal all
the minor injuries to
the skin, as Avell as
the more serious ones,
and Rexona Soap pro-
tects the user from
disease, and ensures
both heal t h an d
beauty. Rexona Soap
is also unequalled as
a shampoo for the
hair.

"T)0 YOU KNOW the importance of rich blood? It will be evident
you consider that the entire system derives its nourishment
from the blood.
When the blood is poor in quality and unable properly to perform
its function, the system becomes starved.
The sufferer complains of exhaustion, lassitude, loss of appetite
and depression —he is debilitated.
He will continue to suffer until his blood is enriched and strengthened.
This is when Iron 'Jelloids,' The Reliable Tonic, are needed to

The Fairy Ring.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
> r piS a strange little smile you are wear-
| ing, my girl—
Oh, did ever a mouth know so weary
a droop !
Is it Old Mother Grief who’s unwinding a
curl,
And your bonny brave heart that is caught
in the loop?
So settle your bodice and wrinkle your lace,
And hold up a little white ear, for I bring
A whimsical tale of the wonderful place
Where the fairies danced in a faery ring.
For I stared the inscrutable face of the Dark
On the curve of the hill where the gold stars
shine,
And watched while each grey dog’s grufforous
bark
Droned to a growl and a wheening whine;
And I watched while the city lights ebbed
from sight—
How the frail little lights to the Dark will
cling,
Like sparkles of dew on the gown o’ the
Night:
And I watched for the dance o’ the faery
ring.
Then, toes to the stalk and heels to the grass
And little white hands on the clover-shoots,
I watched the fairies pass and pass
With a tappetty-tapping of tiny boots ;
Round and round, with a song and a jest.
Round and round till my slow mouth smiled,
And a quizzical fairy stole into my breast
And changed my heart to the heart of a
child.
And then in the faery ranks I saw
Dignified aunts in their stately silk,
The round, ruddy face of the boy next door,
The loud-lunged fellow who brought the
milk ;
The cook and the baker; the lean, sleek cat;
The pig-tailed maid with her spoon and
plate,
And the fairy king with the tall, tall hat
Who lifted me up at the garden gate ;
The queen of the fairies who sat apart
On a thin low chair by the slim quick fire,
Who gathered me close to her jocund heart
And kissed and kissed to her heart’s desire ;
The well-worn bag with its wealth of toys,
And a blithe little fellow who laughed with
glee,
A drawn blind shielding a room from noise,
And the men from the city who came to tea.
And drowsily dreaming upon the rug
By the fairy caves in the sputtering grate,
I felt on my shoulder the good-night hug
When the long day ended at half-past eight;
For the queen of the fairies, with nut-brown
hair,
Carried me up, with her dainty feet
Softly tapping upon the stair,
To a quaint little cot with its star-white
sheet.
And the grey rat knocked, the loose board
creaked,
The drawn blind rapped on the window-pane ;
A tap in a bathroom hissed and leaked
And dripped and dripped like warm, slow
rain ;
And wonderful ladies from fairy-lore
Hovered and smiled o’er the pillow-slip,
Till sleep came softly across the floor
And hid the whole world with her finger-tip.
Over the sea and over the hills
Clambered the sun to my daisied place;
Firing the dew on the window-sills,
Stroking its fingers across my face ;
And the wide sky wakened upon my sight,
And the town-mist lifted and swayed and
curled,
And I found the fairies had followed the
night
And left me alone ’mid a grown-up world.
They were fairykins all ; but the dim night
brings
The whimsical joys that the flesh outgrows,
And the well-tuned heart feels tenderer
things
As the fragrance wells from the soul of a
rose.
Little wan girl, on the curve of your heart
Let the fairies dance in a faery ring,
And a merry, bright song from your throat
will start
Of a Fairy Queen and a Fairy King!

A Matter of Duty.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GASSON —cunning, vindictive
Gasson —was at large once more.
The news of his discharge from
the Launceston Gaol flashed up and
down the coast with the almost in-
credible rapidity such ill news travels.
To the majority of the people the man
was no more than a name —an evil
name, culled from the columns of the news-
paper. But there were others, settlers
along the South Down plains, to whom the
news of “Big” Gasson’s unexpected release
came as a blow in the face. Such was the
sinister record of this man that the coast
folk became seized with a kind of mental
panic at the bare thought of his reappear-
ance amongst them.
Of those affected, police-trooper South,
stationed on the Constantin River, had most
reason to feel uncomfortable. It was he
who had finally run Gasson to earth in the
heart of the swamps, where he had taken
refuge after having almost battered to death
the old hutkeeper on the Fisli Bay coast-
run. It was South’s cleverly-given evidence
that had come more nearly than anything
else to hanging “Big” Gasson as high as
Tlaman. It had been touchy and go then.
But a flaw in the prosecution had been
seized on by the smart mainland lawyer,
retained, it was said, by some rich connec-
tions of the prisoner who were unwilling to
iisk the stigma of capital punishment, and
nve years for attempted murder had been the
p e Punishment exacted. The law pro-
essed to be satisfied, even if justice was
not. And now they had turned him loose
agiun with 12 months of his sentence re-
mitted.
1 rooper South was posting his mail in
tUly mail-box at the Cripple Creek Post
' . e when the news came through on the
wires. His hand, outstretched with the
letters, remained rigid for the length of time
that, it took the postmaster to call the tid-
ings ; then he quietly dropped his mail into
the box and felt unemotionally in the pocket
of his tunic for the blackened pipe that
shared his perplexed moments.
I he postmaster watched rather curiously.
He had been in the district many years, and
knew the ins and out of the Caisson busi-
ness almost as well as did the slim-built
policeman before him who had caught his
man single-handed. Mingled with the post-
master s curiosity was genuine concern. The
tone of his voice betrayed it.
Of course, if I hear anything of his
movements I’ll let you know at once, Jim.
Beats me what they let him out for, with
that much of his sentence still to run.
Maybe, he’s reformed; they do say a spell
of hard labor works wonders. I shouldn’t
worry about it, if 1 were you. lie’s more
than likely forgot his grouch by now.”
“Animals like him don’t forget.” The
trooper’s forehead was puckered in a frown.
‘You weren’t there to hear the snarl in his
voice when he threatened me—l was. It
was when they’d given his sentence out. I
was standing at the back of the court, and
he looks over at me with that cold-blooded
smile of his, and says he: ‘May God strike
me dead,’ he says, ‘if I don’t even up with
that —■— policeman of yours when I get
out again.’ You should have heard the wav
the Judge roared at him. No; he’ll make
this way right enough. Well, let him come ;
I’m not afraid. I got him once, and I
reckon I can do it again if he makes
trouble.”
“AVell, watch out,” advised the post-
master, turning into the office at the call
of the telephone. “If he comes at you at
all, it will be when you ain’t ready—you
can bank on that.”
“They’ll keep a good eye on him at head-
quarters,” called South. “All the same, if
you hear anything you can let me know.
Letting him go like this is one on me. I
ain’t scared, though.”
He unhitched his horse from the fence
and rode away in something of a hurry. In
spite of his previous disclaimer, it was evi-
dent that he was a trifle uneasy. Reaching
home he returned his wife’s greeting ab-
stractedly, eating his dinner in thoughtful
silence. Afterwards, he reached down his
revolver from where it hung on the wall of
the chimney and commenced to clean it.
Ilis wife, coming in to clear away the
dishes, found him spinning the barrel of the
weapon with his forefinger, with a little
satisfied smile on his face at the smooth
running of it.
“What’s the matter, .Tim? What d’you
want to get cleaning that up for? Anything
the matter?”
“Nothing out of the way. There’s a bit
of a character got his discharge from Laun-
ceston to-day, and maybe he’ll find his way
into these parts. It’s as well to be ready,
that’s all.”
She eyed him in quick suspicion.
“You’re not telling me all you know.
There’s something behind. Was—was he
an enemy of yours? Are you expecting him
to make trouble?”
South laughed reassuringly, tossing the
weapon to the table while he drew the girl
on to his knee.
“It’s quite all right, little woman; you
don’t need to worry.- It’s only some tough
I had trouble with a few years ago, before
you and I met. They gave him five years,
when they should have hanged him. He
blamed me for getting sent up. Now
they’ve let him out, he might try to stir up
trouble. But I don’t see what he can do. I
did my duty, and I don’t regret it. Some-
one had to get him.”
She shivered a little.
“I know; but he —that sort of a man
mightn’t understand. I think I’d sleep
easier if you were out of the police. You
can’t go straight without making enemies.
I don’t like it.”
“Some folk would get a set on you no
matter what you were at,” said the trooper,
gravely. “No ; I reckon you wouldn’t want
your husband to crawl down for fear of
getting himself hurt. Don’t worry. If
Gasson comes-this way, I’ll get plenty of
warning. Someone’s bound to see him.”
But nobody did. From the day of his
discharge the man seemed to vanish utterly.
For all the police knew of his whereabouts
he might not have existed. His disappear-
ance was complete.
As time passed and nothing was heard of
him the coast folk began to breathe more
freely. Even Trooper South was lulled into
a sense of security which his knowledge of
Gasson should never have permitted. He
began to relax, his vigilance, and his gun
filled its accustomed place on the chimney
wall.
“Gasson’s had sense enough to get out
of the country,” he told his friend the post-
master one day. “Ten to one he’s clean
forgot about me, and I doubt if we’ll hear
any more of him.”
“Well, maybe,” acceded the official,
doubtfully. “I’d keep my eye skinned awhile
yet though, if I were you. This is a queer 1
country, and there’s some queer folk in it.”
“But Gasson’s out of it,” said South ; and
went his way laughing.
Came a day in midsummer when the
police-sergeant in charge at Sandy Bay tele-
phoned his men to beat the coast-runs for
trappers. It was close season, but skins
were getting through to town. It was up
to each man to clean up bis district.
Trooper South made ready for an early
start. He had three hacks in the police
paddock, but he chose to ride a colt of his
own, a fiery little bit of horseflesh, just
rising three and hacked scarce a fortnight.
South reckoned a trip over the button-grass

DOYOUL
Do you look so well as you once did? Do you feel so well? If not, Have you sus-
pected your kidneys as the cause?
The uric acid and poisonous matters kept back in the system by disordered kidneys
soon tell on the looks—soon age the sufferer; the skin becomes sallow, the eyes lose
their lustre and become bloated, the cheeks are sunken. The disposition, too, is quickly
affected by kidney poisons ; the sufferer grows moody, listless, irritable, feels in every-
body’s way, and can’t be cheered.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills succeed in all cases of Kidney and Bladder trouble
because they are a true kidney medicine—they don’t act on the bowels, but give all their
healing powers to the kidneys, helping them in their great blood-purifying work. Doan’s
Pills begin at once to strengthen and tone up the tired kidney membranes, and help the
kidneys to drive out the clogging kidney poisons that cause aching back and pains in the
loins, urinary troubles and gravel, nervousness, dizzy spells and heart trouble, dropsy,
and the fatal Bright’s disease. Our neighbors’ word, given here, is good proof of how
truly the genuine Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills will help the sufferer.
NINE YEARS CURED.
Mrs. Chas. Anderson, 21 Wyndham
Street, Alexandria, Sydney, says“My
back troubled me for a long time, the sharp,
shooting pains making my life a misery. I
could not stoop, and suffered great pain
trying to get about to do my work. Even
when lying in bed at night I got no ease.
I could not get anything to give me relief,
though I used a great many remedies. How-
ever, I at last got a thoroughly good one
in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. These
wonderful pills stopped the pain like magic,
and I have been quite free of it for two
years now. No one need endure the agony
of backache, for Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills will certainly cure this ailment.”
Mrs. Anderson confirms the above seven
years later:—“l can now add the important
fact that I have been free of backache ever
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me nine years ago.”

FOUR. YEARS CURED.
Mr. Jas. Wilson, 17 Little Buckingham
Street, Sydney, says:—“For a long time I
suffered torture from backache and kidney
trouble. The pains in my back were very
severe, and I have been so bad that I could
not attend to my work, as every movement
caused positive torture. The kidney secre-
tions were affected, being thick and cloudy,
and containing a red sediment. I was also
subject to dizzy feelings, and could not
sleep properly at night. Nothing 1 took
seemed able to give me any permanent relief,
but one day when I was feeling very bad, I
heard good reports of Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills, so I sent for some, and after taking
seven bottles I was cured. This remedy
not only banished the backache, but
strengthened and toned up my kidneys, and
improved my general health. It is four
years since I was cured, and I have had no
trouble with my kidneys since.”

and through the sandhills would give the
colt something better to think about than
running round the yard knocking the rails
down.
It was early dawn of a warm, still morn-
ing when lie manoeuvred himself into the
saddle and finally got the colt going along
the heathland. The brute bored unmerci-
fully, and the trooper’s wrists were quickly
aching. He had to watch himself. Twice
the colt suddenly propped and nearly un-
seated him. Then came catastrophe.
They were topping a knoll-ridge and the
colt jibbed. South, whose patience was
about exhausted, brought his spurs into
his mount’s ribs. The animal went at
it with a sudden rush, swerved past a
clump of tea-tree, caught his near forefoot
in a curly gum-root, and sent South flying-
out of the saddle to land on his back in a
sand-drift. When he could sit up and scrape
the rubbish out of his mouth and eyes the
colt was a quarter of a mile away.
The trooper got up swearing. Beyond a
good shaking he was unhurt, although his
mouth was bleeding where a bit of drift-
wood had jabbed it. It was the prospect of
a five-mile walk back home, with his day’s
work still to do, that worried him. He had
no fear for the colt. It would make straight
home, unless the trailing reins caught some-
how. He had known of a horse starved to
death that way.
He unbuttoned his tunic at the throat and
commenced to climb the side of the nearest
knoll. From the top of it the surrounding
country would be clear to see and, by keep-
ing to the ridges, he might cut the distance
a trifle.
The side of the knoll went almost straight
up into the air. By the time he was three-
quarters of the way up he was about winded.
The ground where he found himself now
ran level for a yard or two, forming a kind
of rough shelf across the face of the cliff.
On the far side, close to the next tier of
ground, was, a pile of rocks. By climbing
on this, South reckoned he might make a
jump for the crest.
It proved easier than he had thought. A
moment’s pause on the topmost boulder,
settling his body for the spring; then he
launched himself for the ridge five feet away,
caught at a tussock of silver-grass, hung a
moment, then drew himself up and rolled
into a hollow.
When he looked up it was to see the bar-
rel of a shot-gun within six inches of his
nose, and behind it the sullen face and evil,
squinting eyes of “Big” Gasson.
For the fraction of a minute the men
stared at each other I —South, dismayed and
apprehensive; the other, eager, triumphant,
vindictive.
Then Gasson withdrew the point of his
gun backwards till he stood erect a yard away
and spat out a single sentence.
“Got you—at last.”
The man was literally a scarecrow.
Weeks of burrowing through the bush in
order to reach his objective unseen and un-
hindered, lest his victim should be warned,
had reduced his clothing to rags. He looked
ill-nourished and ill-humored.
Trooper South met his scowl squarely.
Outwardly he was unconcerned; inwardly
he cursed the criminal folly that had sent
him out unarmed and unthinking of what
the day might bring forth. He moistened
his lips in an effort to speak, but Ins mouth
was swollen and still bleeding, and the words
came with difficulty.
“What’s the joke, ‘Big’? Better put that
gun of yours away, hadn’t you? It’s right
in a line with my stomach, and I don't fancy
it going off.” . , T ,
Gasson laughed without humor. tie
thought South’s halting speech was due to
fright, and the belief gave him added plea-
sure.
“Yes; it’ll go off all right—when I m
ready. When it does, you’ll forget to men-
tion* it. Man, I’ve lain awake at nights
praying for this. I knew I’d square with
you one day. That’s why I took my dose
lying down, and fooled them into thinking
the black sheep had turned color, till they
felt sorry for me and turned me loose. It
they’ve a sense of humor, they ought to
appreciate this when they hear of it. But
they won’t if I can help it.”
“Don’t be a fool,” said South painfully.
“Look here, Gasson, you’re an educated man
whatever else you are. You can shoot me
if you like, but if you do they’ll hang you—
as sure as God made little apples. And I
fancy you’re too smart to run the risk of
that. Cut the old trouble out of your life,
and start again. I'm willing to forget
this.”
“It’s a bit too late for you to learn.” said
Gasson, setting his finger to the trigger of
the gun, “but the knowledge may come use-
ful to you even in Hell. ‘Never forget and
never forgive.’ The Devil himself couldn’t
have a better motto than that, and it’s not
for me to turn my nose up at mv betters. If
you know a prayer you might as well say
it.”
“I only did my duty,” said South, with
paling face. “You speak as if the matter
were personal; as God hears me, it was not.
I should have done what I did if you had
been my dearest friend. It was a matter
of duty. You’re not thinking to murder me
for that?”
Gasson burst out into a sudden rage.
“I know what you police are ! When it’s
a matter of mauling a man and hunting him
down like a wild beast, you brag about duty.
Duty be damned ! It’s a catchword to ease
your conscience. Did you never stop to
think it’s your duty to be decent sometimes?
What are‘you staring at? You can’t trick
me that way. There’s nothing behind me,
and you know it”
But he was wrong. South, whose despair-
ing glance had momentarily gone past the
threatening gun, saw a black, shining coil
raise itself from a crevice of the rocks, with
flattened head drawn back to strike. From
between his swollen lips issued a hoarse croak
of warning, fcut he was too late. There
came a swift streak of color across the grey
dulness of the rocks, a sharp cry of fear as
the snake struck, the sudden frenzied kick
that dislodged it from Gasson’s ankle, and
the thunderous report of the shot that blew
the reptile into a spatter of blood and slime
against the side of the cliff.
The next moment the trooper had sprung
on Gasson and felled him with a blow be-
hind the ear. The man went down like a
pole-axed bullock. South caught up the
gun and heaved it into the gully below.
He turned to find Gasson sitting up clutch-
bit!" The bewildered
wretch could only repeat over and over
again, “I’m bit, 1 tell you—my God, Im
hit.” In the sudden turning of the tables
he was as helpless as a child.
South went down on one knee and turned
back the ragged trouser-leg. Th e surface ot
the wound was smeared with a little blood,
lie wiped it away, unhindered by Gasson.
who looked on in a kind of stupor, i he
trooper raised shining eyes tr< in his exam
ination of the bite.
“Rouse yourself up, man, and help get a
ligature on your leg. Hurry now:; every
minute counts.”
Big Gasson snarled hack at him in a kind
of frenzy. “Ligature? What good’s a liga-
ture? We’re twenty miles from a doctor,
ain’t we? I know when I’m done. Take
your damned face away, and let me die in
peace.” . . „
“Nonsense; you re not going to die.
South was busy while he spoke. “Sit steady
now while I tighten this twitch. It 11 hurt
you, but that can't be helped. Now I’m
going to suck the bite.'
“You? Man. you can’t; your mouth’s all
bleeding and you’d get the poison yourself.’
Gasson stared inereduously. “Besides, what
do you care? It’s an easy way out for you,
if you only knew it. I was going to kill
you a minute ago, but it looks like it was
your turn.”
“Quiet now till I cut round the bite....
so.” South raised his eyes and looked the
other man full in the face. “If you never
knew it before, you’re going to find that a
policeman’s duty cuts both ways. I know
my job and I’m going to do it. I’ll take the
risk of poisoning my mouth. That’s one of
the risks I’m paid to take. Still now.”
Gasson’s face was a study in conflicting
emotions. Gradually, as he watched the
bent head of this enemy ministering to his
need, his savage expression relaxed and gave
place to one of bewildered admiration.
At the end of five minutes South suddenly
desisted.
“My mouth’s that sore I can’t grip with it
any longer,” he explained. “I reckon you’re
all right now, anyway. How do you feel?”
“I’m a bit giddy, and my leg’s in Hell —
but maybe that’s the bandage,” said Gas-
son. “If —if I come through all right, we’ll
cry quits. You're a man’s man, South.”
“Don’t let it worry you,” said the trooper
confusedly. “It’s —it’s all in the day’s work.
I’ve been glad to do it. See how it feels
like to try to walk, will you? If I loosen
the ligature it’ll ease the pain.”
Came mid day and Gasson found him-
self well on his way to the doctor at Sandy
Bay. He said never a word at parting, but
South found complete satisfaction in the way
his hand was gripped. Unless he was much
mistaken t there would be no more trouble
South pushed his way through the little
knot of wide-eyed folk that stood watchim,

like that? Man, you’d be a kind of hero if
the re wasn’t a doubt of your sanity!”
“The kind of hero you read about in the
‘Bluebell Blossom’ series on the bookstalls”
gaid South . “Listen while.l tell you some-
thing; only, for the Lord’s sake, keen it to
yourself. That snake that bit Gasson wasn’t
poisonous. How do I know? I didn’t
exactly know, I took a chance at it. There
were four punctures on Gasson’s leg; and
more’n two don’t count, the doctors say. I
might have been wrong, but I was willing to
take the chance. I had to make friends

Fortune.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dame Fortune’s a jade with a fanciful horn
Of silver ambitions she warms into flame;
With pearls for the princes and tears night
and morn
For poor little poets who fluttered for fame.
Who smile when she sings as she dances
along :
“Come woo me with courage and delicate
song.'’
I followed her once, hut she wearied me
soon.
All careless was I of her roseate quest.
I built a dream house, while the stars were
in tune,
And slipped into silence and exquisite rest;
But she, like her sex, when my passion
seemed cold,
Ran hither and offered me all of her gold.
I went to the door, and I looked at her ware
Of agate and amber and cool crysolite;
I shook my wise head with a holiday air.
And bade her good-day in a daring delight.
For I am a fool, and my fortune is made;
I care not a fig for a crown or a spade;
I dwell with the elves, ’neath the odorous
sky ;
The dews of the dawn brush my gables with
glee;
And moonlights and sunlights and lovers
pass by
All humming this song as they peep upon
me:
“Heigh-ho! for the fool, who can pity all
pelf,
And finds in his bliss that his fortune’s
himself.”
