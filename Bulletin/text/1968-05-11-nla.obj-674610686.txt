Ever'fry'an egg at minus 320°F.?
That's just one stunt to show how fast
liquid nitrogen can freeze just about
anything. First, break an egg into a frying
pan. Then pour in the liquid nitrogen.
Instantly, the egg looks cooked. But it
isn't. It's frozen solid.
Nitrogen has come a long way since
those early kitchen capers. Today, the
Australian food industry uses CIG liquid
nitrogen in many ways. Most notable among
these are for the refrigeration of frozen
food transport vehicles...and in the
freezing of most types of food. CIG
nitrogen gas, however, is used to
permeate products, from wines to
edible oils, and displace all oxygen.
This process, called 'sparging', helps
keep products at their best in taste and
appearance longer than was previously
possible. You'll always see CIG sticking
their nose into just about everything.
To see what cooks. To see what can
be done more efficiently, effectively
and with far greater economy.

ONE-UPMANSHIP
JIM KILLEN, a cheerful extrovert who
put himself through law school while
serving full-time as the Liberal member
for Queensland’s Moreton, last week
revealed himself as possessed of con-
siderable theatrical talent.
The Social Services Minister, Wil-
liam Wentworth, elevated by Prime
Minister Gorton to the Ministry after
17 years on the back bench, was seek-
ing approval from the joint Govern-
ment parties for his first piece of legis-
lation, designed to give assistance to
deserted wives not eligible for benefits
under the Social Services Act.
For years as a turbulent backbencher
Mr. Wentworth has been making fiery
speeches in party meetings complaining
that the Government parties were being
asked to endorse legislation which they
were seeing for the first time and de-
claiming that he was reserving for him-
self the right to vote against the legisla-
tion in the Parliament.
Mimicking Wentworth’s distinctively
shrill voice with superb skill, Killen
embarked upon a perfect Wentworth
speech of pre-Ministerial era. “It is
disgraceful,” said Killen. “The first
time we have seen this complex, signi-
ficant piece of legislation was when we
walked into this room. I am not say-
ing that the Minister is misleading us
deliberately, but I do say that he has
been less than frank.” Pointing a
minatory finger at Wentworth, red-
faced with laughter, Killen declaimed,
as Wenthworth had so many times
before him, “Well may you blush, Mr.
Minister.”
Finishing his speech with a typical
Wentworthian peroration, Killen de-
clared that he reserved his right to
vote against the legislation in the
Parliament. “I ask those in this room
who share my views to rise in their
places,” said Killen. Both parties rose
in a body. Wentworth, choked with
laughter, said simply, “You win.”
CONVERSION JOB
ANYONE who can transform Sydney’s
Macquarie Auditorium, with its
baroque decoration and stale memories
of bygone radio shows, into an inti-
mate theatre with gold-and-grey soph-
istication, and a new name, the Play-
box . . . anyone who can do that
without upsetting the conscientious
middle-of-the-road equilibrium of the
Macquarie broadcasting people must
be Elarry M. Miller. Mr. Miller might
yet be called on as Australia’s answer
to a dozen World Fairs; meantime, he
is occupied with his current enthusi-
asm, which is the Playbox.
“You should have seen this place
before we moved in,” he said, waving
an arm toward a painter brushing a
dignified gold over the last green-and-
red patches of Macquarie Auditorium
chic. “This carpet will be shampooed,
that floor will be covered with grey
linoleum, that sofa will have to go;
take a note of that, Sandy: the sofa
is out - I’ve got carpenters doing
something rather clever with the seats,
and I’ll have big blow-up pictures of
Maggie and Frank here, here, and
here.”
South Africans Maggie Soboil and
Frank Lazarus are motivating Mr.
Miller’s enthusiasm. Since he con-
tracted their act of hilariously inven-
tive parody at the Adelaide Arts Fes-
tival he has spent close to SBOOO
preparing their way for what he hopes
will be a long season in Sydney.
He homed in on the Macquarie
Auditorium for his stage despite the
fact that friends and advisers told him
its owners would be reluctant to dis-
possess 2GB community concerts,
quizzes, and children’s shows. The
auditorium had become a sort of monu-
ment to Jack Davey’s hi-ho heyday, and
even though Barry Humphries rented it
for a tentative return to Australia in
Harry M. Miller
1962, its atmosphere of pre-television
radio had been casually preserved.
Pessimists are for confounding.
Harry Miller was given a two-year
lease of the place, with options, and
even talked the lessors into taking
down the Macquarie Auditorium neon
and letting him replace it with a bou-
levard marquee in Playbox-blue and
gold. He called in designer Desmond
Digby to create a proscenium stage
from a radio-show sound shell, put
painters and printers to work, and
prepared to open “An evening with
Maggie and Frank” on May 17. At a
distant date he will follow them with
Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski’s “Sound and
Image,” plans to sub-lease the Play-
box for Saturday afternoon children’s
theatre, and, when Phillip Street law
students have relinquished their lunch-
time tenancy of the auditorium for
lectures, hopes to offer it to young
theatricals at cut rates for midday ex-
periments.
All of which is coming about, as
Mr. Miller gently reminded us, on the
tenth anniversary of his incorporation
as an entrepreneurial comet. Strange;
it only seems like last Thursday that
he zoomed across from New Zealand.
ACT-ONE CURTAIN
THE party is over: a breach has
opened between Buckingham Palace
and the Beatles. John, Paul, George,
and Ringo have refused to appear at
this year’s Royal Command variety
show; the Queen has announced her
intention of entering the fringe of
showbiz by appearing in a TV docu-
mentary on her daily life. Does this
mean that the Beatles are about to
send back their MBEs?
THE LIBRARIES GAP
“WHY DO children fail in universi-
ties? Because the lower schools do not
have decent libraries, and so the kids
don’t learn how to study on their own,”
one headmaster said, trying for a rough
summary of one of the 'main concerns
of this year’s Australian Library Week.
A report prepared for the Library Week
Council by Mrs. Margaret Trask of the
University of New South Wales
expresses the point as, “If education
through the (school) library is a natural
process, if the library method permeates
the entire curriculum, the school library
will contribute significantly to such
educational objectives as the encourage-
ment of children to independent learn-
ing and self-propelled study, the
training of pupils in research and the
enrichment of their experience.”
Mrs. Trask’s “School Libraries: A
Report to the Nation* (Cheshire, 50c)
was published last week to coincide
with the opening of Australian Library
Week, but one of its statements — that
Australia spends 37c per year per child
on school libraries, against “minimum
standard” requirements of $3-$6 per
child per year — could easily cause
its pigeonholing in the minds of parents,
school authorities, and Governments.
Not for ever, though, because the money
All their own work

Ringo Starr.
I don’t know why people are hitting
my place all the time—there are at least
seven other fur stores in this street.
—Sydney furrier Bernard Hammerman, after
the third burglary at his store
Sometimes we have a real job to
make up our minds what the public
should have; whether it is good for
them and whether it is what they want.
—W. S. Hamilton, assistant general manager
of the ABC.
The Postmaster-General should sug-
gest, very politely, to the ABC that
programs attacking Anzac Day and
slogans such as “Let’s Quench the
Anzac Spirit” are offensive.
Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes, MP.


involved, a mere S2O million or so, is
a small enough sum for any Federal
political Party to see as offering much
at small cost as an election promise.
To emphasise this, the report compares
the school libraries gap with the science
laboratories, one which was bridged by
Commonwealth grants for school science
facilities.
Will the teachers’ associations speak
up for the Library Week report? Prob-
ably not. The teachers are growing as
a pressure group, but their aims are
fragmented. In some States their 'main
force is being exerted against State Aid
for denominational schools. In Queens-
land the teachers’ annual conference
this week will be mainly concerned with
the depressed profession in their State,
which has enlisted some 50 short-course
dilutees to teach in secondary schools
a matter to be resolved by a State-
wide ballot of 10,000 Queensland teach-
ers, with a boycott of the “emergency
teachers” scheme in prospect. Australian
teachers realise as well as anyone how
badly the standards of their profession
are being allowed to slip, and how far
these standards were behind the ideal
anyway.

Melbourne
THE ODDITIES NEVER
GOT A LOOK IN
JUST LATELY there has been a
gurgitation of gorgeous books on Mel-
bourne. After the success of “The Aus-
tralians” everybody has been getting
into the act neatly written text and
a superb array of pictures. Neil
Clerehan in the “Age” called them
“coffee table books.” The latest is a
$10.50 whopper, text by Osmar White,
pictures by Gordon De’Lisle, and now
there is barely room left on your coffee
table for your copies of “Australasian
Post,” “Pix,” and “Man.”
Before going any further could one
say that this is the most superior book
there has been on Melbourne, and the
pictures are sensitive, highly profes-
sional, and often very beautiful indeed.
In my opinion Gordon De’Lisle is, and
has been for a long time, the best
photographer around. It starts with an
introduction by the Lord Mayor, Cr.
Talbot, and that makes one suspicious
at once. Obviously here is a book that
will be handed to all distinguished
visitors, hence it will contain nothing
vulgar, nothing nasty, and the wash-
ing won’t be out on the Hill’s hoist.
Cr. Talbot talks of the “vision, enter-
prise,” etc., ‘hhe region beautifully en-
dowed by nature” the city that “does
not experience cruel extremes of
climate.” One must presume his office
is air-conditioned, for some of the
migrants who visited our city last
summer seemed to consider that we
suffer from extremes of climate. The
Mayor indicated in his forward that
he was very fond of Melbourne. So am
I. God knows why perhaps it is
comfortable. Like an old pair of shoes,
it doesn’t really pinch anywhere. When
overseas visitors arrive and they ask
to see the sights it’s a damned hard
project. You almost find yourself tak-
ing them to see “Chloe,” the gallery-
museum known here as “Phar Lap’s
Stable,” the MCG, the shrine. Some-
how these old cliches seem to fit the
place.
Physical beauty? The Gardens, yes,
but Port Phillip Bay has nothing this
side of Mount Eliza. As my old science
teacher used to say: “They tell you to
go down to Brighton to smell the ozone.
That’s not ozone, boy, that’s the stink
of the sewage.”
Then the vast area of the city has
a terrible flatness about it. The south of
the Yarra and the nicer suburbs are all
right. A Monash lecturer once said
that the length of Burke Road is the
longest stretch of well-stuffed suburbia
in the world, and that’s about it. The
vast reaches of Northcote, Preston,
Reservoir, Brunswick, Coburg, Essen-
don, Moonee Ponds, Footscray are hell,
the endless areas of small-shopped, tree-
less, overhead-wired, Peters-ice-cream-
four-and-twenty pie-advertised arid
suburbia, no sign of beauty anywhere,
go on for ever. Even more than in
Chicago and New York there is snob-
bery that makes nice Melburnians
desperate to get into the right suburbs
and to send their children to the right
schools.
We don’t riot, we conform, we ate
easily shocked, and there is still a heavy
hangover from the Sabbatarians who
were all-powerful in the 1880 s. Six
o’clock closing has gone, but the pubs
are still with us and many hotel bars
have the atmosphere of public lava-
tories and much less comfort. We have
private firms that spend incredible
millions on prestige buildings and per-
haps less on art and sculpture than any
equivalent prosperous city in the world.
We are one of few such cities without
an underground railroad, but we have’
put in much more talking about it
than other cities, and there is still no
hope of getting one. Our City Council
is a quarter as effective as it should be
and our Lord Mayor is elected on a
system almost a century out of date.
Parts of the city are beautiful, parti-
cularly Royal Parade, Spring Street,
and the Fitzroy Gardens. Swanston
Street is hideous and the Paris end of
Collins Street is being steadily ruined
by the selfish manner in which the big
filing cabinets are being constructed,
something which would never be
allowed on the Melbourne end of the
Champs Elysees.
Please forgive that outburst —I was
beginning to think that I was writing
the book myself. Osmar White in his
careful text does touch on many of
these things, but often when he is on
the point of really saying something he
draws back, qualifies, and moves on
elsewhere. Yet he does write well of
the “Victorian pomposity and ugliness”
and how it is very hard to discern Mel-
bourne as part of Asia.
Says he: “Many a newcomer stands
in the back lanes of Hoddle’s golden
mile on a wet winter evening and is
reminded by the cobbles and the stained
brick walls of an industrial town in
England’s drear Midlands; or he may
look out from some fourth-floor window
commanding the roofs and chimneys of
Carlton or North Melbourne and, with-
out any wild stretch of homesick
imagination, find that the vista con-
jures up memories of Putney or Birken-
head or Reading.”
He almost expresses contempt for
the “concrete boxes of the Housing
Commission,” he does write of the
“passion for the intrinsically ugly” in
suburbia, and he writes very nicely
on the spaciousness of Melbourne. Pie
has this very good line: “The "most
perceptive comment I have ever heard
from a newcomer came from a migrant
German girl who, wide-eyed and
incredulous after her first tour of the
town, exclaimed, ‘But all the grass
and all the people walking on it.’ ”
He points out that the social atmos-
phere is amazingly provincial and drab
“Still, you can’t judge a book by its
cover!”
and he talks sharply of the Melbourne
Cricket Ground. He says that the vast
dish of tiered concrete “in a way
symbolises the fundamental coherence
of a so'metimes perilously egocentric
community.” This is first-class, but
alas, he does not go on from there.
Melbourne is egocentric in its football,
egocentric in its politics, and ego-
centric in its social interests, and it has
an egocentric Premier, who doesn’t
really give a hoot what goes on in
Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, or
Darwin, and only economically in what
happens in Canberra.
Frankly, Gordon De’Lisle’s pictures


deserve to be on a coffee table; many
of them are honestly breathtaking. Yet
they do give an unbalanced picture ol
Melbourne; some of them make Mel-
bourne look so irresistible the overseas
tourist might want to catch the first
aeroplane. There are a few horror
shots, like the toothless mouth of
Flinders Street Station and the
marshalling yards of Joliniont, but the
De’Lisle camera tends to make all on
God’s earth beautiful. He is not like a
Pugh or an Olsen who might be
entranced at the idea of painting a
rotten sheep, and the “Melbourne,”
published by the Hill of Content Pub-
lishing Co., looks as contented as all
get out, as the Americans say.
The captions are all in four
languages, so no doubt there will be
stacks of copies in the Agent-General’s
office in London. For this purpose
“Melbourne” is magnificent. Now I
would like to see the same gentlemen
do another book for the home market,
enlarging on our oddities, and giving
a few real reasons why we became so
damned odd.

SELLING THREDBO AS
A NON-SKIING PLACE
SKIING, skiing needs publicising? But
everyone knows at this time of year the
nonchalant thing to say is the family’s
off to the snow and yes, darl, it costs a
fortune, but what else is there to do,
you know, Tom adores it so, yet here
is this man John Hagley saying “My
word, yes, it needs publicising, my
word, yes.” And then adds, as if it were
sacrilege, that there are still a lot of
people unaware of Thredbo. Well, to
be more specific, 20,000 were aware of
it last year, and this year his job as
Thredbo’s sales manager is to up the
figure to 25,000.
So while Mr. Dusseldorp—he is
Thredbo, among other things—is up on
Australia Square Tower’s 46th floor
enjoying panoramic views of Sydney,
Mr. Hagley and his staff are toiling
underground in the Thredbo shop in an
effort to capture these ignorant 5000.
It is 4.30. At 5.30 Mr. Hagley expects
the Press who are invited to the
seventh-floor theatrette, which is Aus-
tralia Square parlance for a skiing film
preview and cocktails, which is Thredbo
parlance. This, he says, is Part One
of the exercise. Part Two is to invite
the Press to Thredbo as their guests,
my word, yes. That is, if they want to
come.
At the moment, however, Mr.
Hagley is inquiring into the state of
long pants, men’s, black. Can that
blond Adonis who is sitting there stuff-
ing great wedges of apple-pie and
drinking coffee by. the gallon ensure
delivery, and what about zip-up anoraks
in good colors? They sound great,
John, great, mumbles another tanned
and fatter Adonis through his slice of
pie. Someone shouts a query about
bookings and Mr. Hagley presses a
hand to his forehead. They’ve lost the
damn’d card. What-what-what-what-
what? Actually, today is murder. But
at the same time marvellous. What he
means is two girls have gone home
early, for reasons he cannot fathom,
and bookings are coming in non-stop.
My word, yes. “No, Laurie,” he says to
the Telex girl, “you’ve put the wrong
booking over.” Laurie sighs. She pre-
fers the typewriter which can’t answer
back. Besides, she s gotta sprained
ankle which was not achieved, she says
without a smile, while skiing. She fell
down those steps and lay a good five
Laurie McNally nips into a cupboard to record “instant” snow news and Ingrid
Eckersley handles the phone inquiries
minutes in agony before anyone had
the good manners to come and help.
Anyway, this shop is what Mr. Hag-
ley calls the nerve centre of Thredbo.
My word, yes. Australians panting for
the snow in, say, Victoria or Perth, get
instant information while they wait,
via Laurie’s telex. There are pamphlets
written in swinging English, wherein
guys are guys and birds are birds, and
blown-up pictures of Thredbo looking
rather more black than white, and
strings of fake snow wrapped round
the door, and ski gear in the window.
And where does the high-pressure
“Thredbo News,” dial 2-0510 Sydney,
come from? The stationery and tea-
making cupboard. Laurie nips in here
every morning to record it, but it’s
best, advises Mr. Hagley, to ring about
ten or one receives yesterday’s news.
Now, he says, getting down to the
hard stuff, what we’re doing is selling
Thredbo as a non-skiing place (Eastern
Suburbanites will love that), you know,
as a place to come to for a holiday.
Then we are introducing a package
deal. $6O for sjx days. (That’ll go down
a treat, too.) There are other entice-
ments: a new ski-run for beginners
which cost $f million, T-bars as in
lifts, not beverage ski lessons with
sexy-looking instructors. Oh, Mr. Hag-
ley could go on all day, my word, yes.
The thing is, it is easier to sell ski-
holidays to girls than taen. Well, men
spend all their money taking the girls
out, don’t you see, so the girls save
it. Anyway, once the ratio of girls to
men on the Thredbo Express was 70
percent to 30 percent, so he appealed
to the Army, Navy, and Air Force to
come to the rescue. That brought it
down to 52 percent girls and 48 per-
cent men. Certainly not, he didn’t offer
them free holidays. As a matter of
fact, he could’ve doubled the prices,
Last year they went in for selling
pressure-packed alpine air as a gim-
mick. There’s to be no more of that
sort of thing, though they are thinking
of bottling the water. “I joke you not,”
says Mr. Hagley, “scotch drinkers, con-
rioisseurs, they bring back gallons with
them.”
He is passing over secret information
which must not fall into Perisher’s
hands, although don’t get him wrong,
they are Good Friends, when Gabriel
Carr, who handles PR, sweeps in. The
Press are here and no one’s there to
direct theta. Oh, it’s a shambles, says
Laurie, always a rush at the last min-
ute, and hobbles off to the theatrette
And up there, the skiing Press drink
the hard and stuff olives. John Hagley
says how are you, my word, how are
you. Managing director Mike Matthew
hopes they’ll like the film which cost
a packet, i.e., $9OOO pev-lus, and is the
story of two guys and two birds having
a smashing asexual time in Techni-
color. After it’s over, and one or two
have arranged suitable holidays for
themselves and dependants, Gabriel
Carr jumps up and says righto, now
for the liquor.
Actually, he confides, what this
column really missed was his pancake
story. He had everyone over there
tossing them all over the place in “X”
brand’s new, fantastic, electric, non-
stick frypan.
Mr. Carr is thinking of chucking

SOME WORDS OF
WARNING FROM
A RETIRED CELIBATE
EVERY DAY now one reads of priests
—and every week or so of nuns—who
are rebelling against their vows of
celibacy. Although not a member of
the Roman Catholic Church, I think
this trend is a matter for regret. The
world has enough married people in
it already, goodness knows. Marriage
is, in the literal sense, a vulgar institu-
tion, whereas celibacy is not.
My occasional contacts with celibate
persons have left an impression that
they possess distinctive and most attrac-
tive qualities. Their freedom from
family ties gives them more time to
devote to whatever interests them,
whether it is their work or other people.
I am not referring only to Catholic
priests and nuns. One of the nicest
celibates I have known was an Anglican,
the Rev. Adam Fox, Chaplain of
Magdalen College, Oxford.
I noticed once that Mr. Fox was
visiting the Bodleian Library day after
day, and I asked him what work he
was engaged on. He replied: “I’m
writing a review of the new edition of
the Greek Testament. I’m afraid it is
rather a hurried job—it has to go to
press in three weeks’ time.” Sometimes
while trying to meet newspaper dead-
lines I have thought wistfully of Mr.
Fox and his book review. I am sure
he could not have approached his task
in that spacious way if he had been a
married man. The decline of celibacy
among university dons is one of the
saddest aspects of modern education.
Many of the laity must wonder
whether the priests and nuns who are
renouncing celibacy quite realise what
they are letting themselves in for. Let
us consider the case of Father X, who
left his Order some years ago to enter
the conjugal state.
He was faced at once with a host
of new problems, such as buying a
refrigerator and furniture for the flat
where he was to live with Mrs. X. In
dealing with the hire-purchase com-
pany he found that he no longer com-
manded the implicit trust as Mr. X
which he had as Father X. They
demanded bank references.
Conditions were tolerable at first,
though the flat was more cramped
than his former celibate quarters. But
his living standards declined when the
little Xs began to appear. The ex-
Father walked up and down carrying
teething babies. He was trying to read
a book on the ecumenical controversy
when little Maureen tore two pages
out of it.
Mr. X learned to recognise the
dreaded erk-wup sound of a child with
gastric difficulties during the night. He
noted that this was apt to happen after
the evening meal had included choco-
late pudding or spotted dog. He Be-
came an authority on the symptoms
and treatment of chicken-pox, measles,
mumps, tonsillitis.
One night, after there had been a
quarrel over the snakes-and-ladders
board in the crowded living-room, he
reflected ruefully: “I’m in just as much
trouble now as a Protestant clergyman,
but without the concomitant status.”
His wife’s family all talked loudly
and had large collections of color
slides. Her brother Les persuaded Mr.
X to invest some money in a pet-food
business that went bung. Her mother
dropped hints that he was not a good
provider and criticised his neglect of
the garden.
Mrs. X’s temper did not improve
with time. She complained that he
hardly ever took her out, and during
the subsequent altercation she said:
“You’re not the kind, considerate man
you were when I met you. You’ve
changed since you left holy orders.”
To which he replied sharply: “And
whose fault was that?”
For a man of meditative habits the
lack of privacy was very trying. He
still liked to read his Breviary, but it
was hard to concentrate while the TV
was tuned to “The Three Stooges” or
Saturday Date. ’ If he retired to the
master bedroom the telephone would
ring, and a voice would say: “Can I
speak to Kevin?”
Years passed, filled with dish-drying
and garbage-carrying and bill-paying
and fixing jammed zip-fasteners. The
X children became teenagers. The
eldest boy was a surfie dropout with a
list of traffic convictions. The girls
played pop music loudly and inces-
santly on the transistor.
It was the pop music that finally
broke the former Father X. He went
to the Church authorities and said: “I
want to renounce my marriage vows
and go back to celibacy.”
Their reply was: “We are sorry,
Mr. X, but in the circumstances we
feel unable to accept your application.”
The sad truth is that celibates, like
boxers, find it very hard to make a
comeback.
The Church, in my opinion, is using
the wrong tactics to deal with the celi-
bacy revolt. Instead of stressing the
doctrinal justification of the rule, it
should appoint Celibacy Guidance
Councils, composed of married
men and women with large families.
These could talk to the priests and
nuns concerned and urge them quietly
to think it over.

THE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF A SYMBOL
Recently a triodetic dome was
inspected at the University of
N.S.W. School of Architecture.
Triodetic is a further example of
the expanding product range by
George Hudson.
Agreed, the Company was tra-
ditionally known for its timber
activities. Milling; Importing;
Retailing.
More recently, a carefully
planned diversification pro-
gramme has created a new
range of sophisticated products
for specific building require-
ments. The Company’s pro-
gramme also provides a wide
range of integrated products and
services to subcontractors for
total-concept activities. Corpo-
rately, this is the same George
Hudson. Operationally, it is a
much more updated enterprise,
activated by modern manage-
ment methods and dedicated to
an alert, contemporary policy of
product development.
This policy, whilst based on the
Company’s traditional skills, has
been carefully adapted to meet
the changing needs of today’s
conditions.
New policies, new products, new
processes—these represent the
significance of the new GH
symbol. A symbol of broader-

How oriental
are Orientals?
THERE WAS a piece in one of the
papers the other day that put up the
“Asian subtlety” of the Hanoi Govern-
ment, and contrasted it with that crude
old Texan Lyndon B. Johnson, who was
incapable of understanding the nuances
of “the oriental mind.” This is the kind
of statement that sounds as if it might
mean something or other. But does it
have any meaning? Is there an oriental
mind?
To raise this question is not to imply
that “Asians are just like us”; instead,
it is to imply that Asians are not even
like Asians, that, although the word
Asian is useful as a geographical and
geo-political concept, it conceals a
multitude of differences, and it can be
quite dangerously misleading if it sug-
gests that all Asians are alike and have
much the same kind of minds.
There are differences between Presi-
dent Ho and President Johnson; but
they are not the differences of East and
West. As many differences could be
found between the governments of North
Vietnam and of Japan as there are
between Hanoi and Washington. In
discussing the differences between Ho
Chi Minh and Lyndon B. Johnson it is
possible to make sense only by being
specific. And the specifics are not those
of subtlety versus crudity. Such a skilled
politician as President Johnson has nec-
essarily become a master of certain
kinds of subtlety, and in his career as
Senate Majority Leader he had to
exercise skills in political manoeuvre that
could not be matched by the dogmatists
in Hanoi. In fact, one of the criticisms
made of him as President was an excess
of subtlety. That was what the “cred-
ibility gap” was about. And so far as
crudity goes, is Hanoi not more crude
than Washington? If President Johnson
used the kind of language and tactics
that are the usual style of the North
Vietnamese political leaders, members
of the American Congress would now
be looking up the American Constitu-
tion to find out how to get rid of a
President who had become a lunatic.
There are two principal relevant dif-
ferences between President Johnson and
President Ho. One is that President
Johnson is the leader of a democratic
country. He is supposed to be open and
honest in general debate, and he must
take into account an enormous number
of stresses and strains operating within
American politics and American
society. Although the North Vietnamese
leadership has some restraints—its own
internal differences of opinion, its ten-
sions with Russia and China—it does
not have to be so public about them,
and it can be both dishonest and brutal
in its approach to the people it gov-
erns. The second difference is that the

COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
North Vietnamese have an entirely
different military and strategic ap-
proach from the Americans. This
philosophy is not “oriental” it is,
for instance, quite different from the
Japanese military approach, which was
bang-grab-bang just like ours. Its ap-
proach is both Chinese and Communist-
guerilla. The Chinese military philos-
ophy, old and ingrained in Chinese
traditions, spilled over into Vietnam
with the rest of Chinese culture. Much
of the wisdom of Mao is simply a
rewrite in Communist terms of the
traditional military philosophies of
China. And this philosophy with its
emphasis on patience, finesse, cunning,
masquerade, and economy of effort—is
opposed completely to the American
military ideal of plan-action-success. It
is an approach that is particularly
relevant to the kind of irregular war-
fare to which the American military
style finds it hard to accommodate
itself. In World War II the Americans
fought the Japanese without worrying
about oriental subtleties, because funda-
mentally both nations were fighting
from much the same kind of general
assumptions: but in South Vietnam
the Americans and the North Vietnam-
ese have tended to fight two different
wars. To those who know something
about it, there is nothing mysteriously
oriental about the war the North Viet-
namese have been fighting: it is just
a special kind of war. To further point
the comparison: what was “oriental”
about the way the North Koreans in-
vaded South Korea?
Could one not say that the North
Vietnamese are fighting with Spanish
fanaticism, or in general with Latin
pride? Or that they are putting up their
demands with Gallic precision? Or that
they are acting with true British phlegm?
Or, alternatively, with subtle English
perfidy? The Japanese, of course, are
Teutonic in their efficiency as they are
Scandinavian in their scrupulous clean-
liness. And is it not true of the Chinese
that, when the continental European
claptrap of their revolutionary ideology
is over, what one hopes for is that they
will return to that characteristic that
has usually marked Chinese history
the firm, unyielding good sense of
Anglo-Saxon pragmatism?
Since national, social, or religious or
cultural traditions exist it is possible to
talk about them. We are, all of us,
born and bred as part of some set of
traditions, even if sometimes the tradi-
tions conflict; they are the stuff our
lives are made out of, and they give us
most of our senses of difference. But
what a poverty of imagination is reyealed
in those who speak of Asia (which is to
say half the world) as if it were all made
up of the same stuff!

A world-wide success story in structural Steel


AUSTRALIA
Gorton wants to talk
to the next President
By ALAN REID
WHEN PRIME MINISTER John Gor-
ton departs for the United States on
May 23, he plans to see not only Presi-
dent Johnson but four of the five
Presidential candidates. Arrangements
are being made for him to see Vice-
President Hubert Humphrey, Senator
Eugene McCarthy, Richard Nixon, and
Governor Rockefeller. But no moves
have been made for him to meet Sen-
ator Robert Kennedy.
There could be a clue to Gorton’s
own makeup in this. At times so brutally
frank as to be almost indiscreet, Gorton
has the Australians’ fondness for frontal
attack rather than backstabbing. Thus,
while he recognises that McCarthy’s
policies are further from his than those
of the other candidates, he is known
to judge McCarthy as “fair dinkum,”
but you get the impression that he
does not like the way in which Ken-
nedy did not openly get into the fight
against Johnson until McCarthy had
already put his neck on the block.
Nevertheless, whether he is attracted
to him or repelled, Gorton will prob-
ably at least seek to see Kennedy while
he is in the United States. Not to make
a gesture would be too pointed. And
Australia has too much at stake for
personal likes or dislikes to be taken
into consideration. Kennedy has the
potential to become the next President
of the United States, and the President
of the United States is the man who,
for the four years after his election, will
decide the warmth (or coolness) of
America’s relationship with Australia, in
a period when the present order of
things in Asia may be upset by a settle-
ment of the Vietnam situation and
presumably the withdrawal of at
least a significant part of America’s
forces fro’m South-East Asia.
Gorton knows that the fundamental
question with which he has to deal
when he is in America is what the
ANZUS Treaty will mean in the years
ahead if America disentangles itself
wholly or partly from South-East Asia.
It was Johnson who persuaded Gor-
ton to go to the United States. Once
Johnson had announced his withdrawal
from the Presidential contest Gorton
had reservations about going. He was
diffident about seeming to get involved
in United States domestic politics. But
Johnson insisted. He offered Gorton any
dates in May that would suit him. He
told Gorton that he would send his
own aircraft to Honolulu and would
place the plane at his disposal for his
American trip.
Perhaps Johnson felt it was important
to his successor that he should con-
ciliate Gorton, political leader of
America’s most staunch ally since World
War 11. United States Secretary of
State, Dean Rusk, may have told John-
son that there was a need to conciliate
Gorton. When Rusk visited Australia,
shortly after the United States had
announced its changed Vietnam policy
without prior consultation with Austra-
lia, Gorton loyally did not criticise the
United States publicly, but privately he
told Rusk, embellishing his emphasis
with some very Australian adjectives,
that, from Australia’s viewpoint, this
kind of treatment was no good at all.
But now that he has withdrawn from
the Presidential nomination Johnson is
no longer the man who can say how
the United States administration will
interpret the ANZUS Pact in the next
four years. If Johnson adheres to his
intention not to contest the Presidency
(and Gorton is proceeding on this
basis), it will be Humphrey, McCarthy,
Kennedy, Nixon, or Rockefeller who
will be making the decisions. The
Johnson administration can give Gorton
its understanding of what the ANZUS
Treaty means legally. But it will be the
others who will be deciding the applica-
tion of the Treaty for practical pur-
poses and within the framework of
United States South-East Asia policies
as then operating.
It is this that makes Gorton’s con-
tacts with the Presidential candidates
important, and it could be that John-
son recognises this and, paying back
the Australian loyalty of years stand-
ing, is producing a situation in which
Gorton can get assurances and under-
standings from the Presidential candi-
John Gorton’s fundamental question ... what ANZUS will mean?


dates even before they face the United
States electors.
Gorton also wants to clear up two
other things that have been plaguing
him.
One is that for quite a period now
the External Affairs Department has
been insisting that the United States
is anxious to see Australia maintain
a physical presence in the Malaysia-
Singapore area after the withdrawal of
Britain from that region. There is un-
certainly about whether this interpreta-
tion of the United States’ attitude is
correct. Gorton wants that uncertainty
cleared up.
If ultimately an Australian battalion
is left in the region (and, in addition
to the United States’ attitude, there
are other considerations, including the
desires of Malaysia and Singapore and
the degree to which they would co-
operate in joint moves for defence
arrangements and maintenance of facili-
ties that Britain leaves behind when it
quits), Gorton wants to know the terms
on which the battalion will be left. If
the battalion, together with the
Malaysian-Singaporean forces with
which it would be associated, ran into
trouble, what then would be the posi-
tion? Would there be a firm commit-
ment whereby the United States would
come to the aid of the party?
Gorton also proposes to express
hesitations about the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty. The present idea
is that signatories to the Treaty will
receive protection from the nuclear
powers through the mechanism of the
United Nations Security Council. But
Gorton has a profound distrust of this
mechanism, as he pointed out to his
Cabinet recently. Fie wants from
America something more than a state-
ment of pious hopes.
Defence
Silence in words
DEFENCE MINISTER Fairhall told
Parliament and the people last week
that there was some point in remaining
silent when it came to certain parts of
defence planning. He then made the
most silent defence review of his
career. Yet this will be the only defence
statement the Australian public is going
to get this year, now that the Federal
Government has “suspended” forward
defence planning, pending decisions on
Malaysia-Singapore defence. Apart
from revealing a new increase in the
costs of the FIIIC, the fifth in a row,
and widely anticipated, Mr. Fairhall’s
20-page statement revealed nothing not
already known about Government
defence thinking.
Later, in the lobbies, some Govern-
ment backbenchers were openly critical
of the defence statement. One of them,
overheard by Mr. Gorton, was invited
into the Prime Minister’s office and
given a sharp rebuke. But another, Mr.
John Jess (of Voyager fame), carried
his criticism into the House and did a
better job than the Opposition of
demoralising the already apprehensive
Government benches.
If Mr. Fairhall’s original draft of his
defence statement had been passed by
Cabinet, the Australian public would
have had a clearer idea of what might
happen next in defence planning. But
Mr. Fairhall clashed heavily with Mr.
Gorton, who drew the teeth of the
original statement with voracious
efficiency, leaving his Minister with
nothing much to say to Parliament.
And in what he did have to say the
Gorton influence came through very
strongly indeed, in the final draft that
emerged from the Cabinet room on
Tuesday. Although it was Fairhall that
read them, they were Mr. Gorton’s
policies when it was announced that
defence had to take its place alongside
development. “Strong and diverse as
our economic base is, there is a limit
to what we can do in the defence
field,” Fairhall said. “Clearly there is
a point beyond which allocation of
resources to military activities becomes
counter-productive. The ordinary pur-
poses of growth will be prejudiced if
too much manpower, equipment, and
materials are devoted to defence pur-
poses.”
What was most surprising was that,
despite continued utterances from the
Government front benches that Austra-
lia’s defence preparedness must take
priority at all times, the defence state-
ment suggested that this priority was
not so demanding that it could not be
“suspended” for a year until our
defence planners got some clarification
of what the defence demand is likely to
be in the Malaysia-Singapore area after
British withdrawal.
Mr. Fairhall announced that the
present three-year defence program,
which ends on June 30, would not be
replaced ' immediately with another
three-year program. The new three-
year progra'm would not be announced
until the end of this year, and would
start from July 1, 1969 as “the un-
certainties which surround the still-fluid
situation in Malaysia-Singapore make
it undesirable to go firm on the future
at this stage.” He then hastened to
add, “This does not mean a cessation
of, or any loss of, continuity in defence
planning. It does not mean that the
process of maximising the capability of
our defence forces is to be halted. It
does mean adaptation of planning to
changing circumstances.”
What Mr. Fairhall did not say was
that it did mean that any forward orders
for defence equipment deemed neces-
sary in the new defence program would
be delayed a year.
Mr. Fairhall did lift the curtain a
little on the attitude the Government
was planning to adopt at the Five Power
talks in Kuala Lumpur next month on
Fairhall ...no loss of continuity
Malaysia-Singapore defence. “If we are
to maintain a military presence in the
area it must be in the context of a
total co-operative effort, involving all
five powers to be represented at the
June conference,” he said. “We would
not visualise our participation as being
against anybody. Rather it would be
for the preservation of peace, stability,
and development in an area which
vitally affects Australia’s interests.”
His next sentence underlined Austra-
lia’s long-term hopes for the area. “We
would be looking to when truly
regional co-operative arrangements,
would extend beyond Malaysia and
Singapore.” This was obviously a signal
that Australia wants Indonesia, a
country which has repeatedly stated it
would not be a signatory to any defence
treaty, to become a member of the
flock.
There was less optimism about
another expression of hope in Mr. Fair-
hall’s submission that “We should
remember that post-1971 Britain will
still not have renounced all her interests
in our part of the world. She is not
withdrawing from SEATO. She has not
taken the line that never again will
her forces he deployed or be engaged
in exercises in the area with which we
are most concerned. On the contrary,
the British Government has stated that
the United Kingdom will sustain its
interest in the stability of South-East
Asia.” What he did not say was that
Britain, in its submission to the recent
SEATO conference in New Zealand,
left little doubt that it wanted to remain
in SEATO on a cultural basis. The
British delegation said it could not and
would not give any guarantee of mili-
tary participation. This would depend
on the capability of British defence,
which would be based in the European
Theatre after 1971, and “the circum-
stances of the time.”


Trade with Japan
'New era' doubts
WAS THERE an unprecedented flood
of Japanese faces on the city streets
last week or are we just beco'ming
more conscious of them? Certainly the
official list did not account for the.
apparent increase. There were, of
course, the representatives of the car
industry and the Ministry of Inter-
national Trade cheerfully arguing the
du’mping charges in Canberra; and
Mitsubishi’s managing director, Mr.
Matsushita, saying that it was loss of
prestige and not the 300 cars a month
that his Australian subsidiary imports
that was worrying him; and the Bank
of Tokyo president, Mr. Sumio Hara,
suggesting that dumping was “bad
manners” and should be punished. But
the height of the flood two jet-loads
of top Japanese executives bound for
the Australia-Japan Business Co-
operation meeting in Canberra and the
Pacific Basin Economic Co-operation
Committee meeting in Sydney did
not arrive until Monday.
Whatever the appearance, the reality
would seem to be that Japan has
decided to upgrade the sordid bicker-
ings of the present buying-selling
relationship with Australia and pursue
the bride in earnest whether the
paternal figure of Mr. McEwen
approves or not. They are here in
■earnest. There was a balance-of-pay-
ments deficit of $535 million last year,
and as front April 1 last there is a
national objective of increasing exports
by 15 percent a year over the next five
years to be achieved.
Despite massive growth in other
directions, Japan’s exports to Australia
have stagnated over the past few years:
•$258.5 million in 1964-65 and $296
million last year, most of that small
increase being accounted for by a grow-
ing demand for Japanese cars. On the
other hand Australian exports to Japan
have soared handsomely: $440.7 million
in 1964-65, $586.4 million last year
(although in the broadest terms manu-
factured goods—including such fringe
items as tinned fruit—were only worth
$2.6 million), and a healthy start to the
year with Hamersley and Savage River
iron-ore contracts already under way
and new contracts for BHP iron-ore,
bauxite, salt, and grain scheduled to
start rolling in the months ahead. For
Japan, however, figures for January
and February have suggested that it is
becoming harder than ever to get a
foot into Australia’s door; an actual
downturn in Japanese imports are
feared, and trading companies have
became increasingly gloomy.
It is not, some Japanese businessmen
suggest, that they want to achieve a
balance of trade with Australia. As
Mr. Matsushita pointed out last week:
“The politicians tell you to buy our
goods. How can they say it? You’re
only the same size as Tokyo”—but they
do want better access to trade. Mr.
Matsushita is a great “free-trader,” a
great admirer of the philosophies of
Adam Smith: “His doctrine lives.
Economics, investment, industry
everything free.” Mr. Hara is a quieter
enthusiast, both for Japan—“lt cannot
and should not adhere indefinitely to
the degree of protection now being
exercised in respect of its backward
sector”—and similarly for Australia —
“It must adopt increasingly liberal
policies in keeping with the progress in
economic internationalism we see on
all sides.”
Liberalisation rather than protection-
ism is what the Japanese are recom-
mending as the most vigorous approach
Australia can make toward its program
of industrialisation, and Mr. Hara, not
surprisingly, predicts that Japan will
play a very much more important part
in this program than has been the
case: “My bank is formulating its
policies on this premise.”
Japanese business is preparing to
move into the Australian manufacturing
industries in a “much bigger way. A
handful are already here; two of
Japan’s overall industrial giants, Sumi-
tomo and Furukawa, are in the process
of sorting out possibilities; and by the
Hara ... dumping is bad manners
1970 s Japan hopes that the present
trickle will have risen to a steady
stream.
There are many in Australia who
fear any increase in this country’s
economic dependence on Japan. Mr.
Hara offers them some soothing
thoughts. Large-scale capital investment
in developing industries will, of course,
emerge as a major factor. But there
will still be a continuing emphasis on
the joint venture and the financing of
special projects. The capital invest-
ment, however, “will not necessarily
involve controlling interests.” Mr.
Hara is all for Australia maintaining
an equity in all ventures involving
overseas capital, in keeping the
“national initiative” at a high level.
There are also the heavy demands
on Japanese capital resources to be
taken into consideration; they prob-
ably cannot really afford to buy up
Australian concerns lock, stock, and
barrel; if they are to spread their
resources they need partners.
And what could this new era Paean
for Australia? Among other things, a
readjustment of tariff policies, a more
efficient and world-competitive industry,
and a stronger bargaining position from
which to negotiate new long-term
mineral and primary-produce contracts.
But no new era is assured. The
Japanese claim that they have for
some years been making requests to
Canberra for annual meetings at
Cabinet-level on questions of trade and
other matters of mutual interest. They
have been rebuffed. From the Depart-
ment of Trade there would seem to be
emanating a deliberate policy of limit-
ing future development with Japan. It
fits in well with the mood of some
Australian businessmen whose memories
of 23 years ago are kept ever alive by
the fear of Japanese competition and—
so the Japanese believe by the
machinations of political expediency.
The North
Gag removed
THE NORTHERN TERRITORY has
always been somewhat of a Cinderella
in its representation in Federal Parlia-
ment. Even the slipper which the
Government gave the Territory last
week in the form of full voting rights
for its Member did little to give
Territorians an effective say in the
nation’s affairs or even in their own
Government.
The Territory’s Legislative Council
has nothing more than advisory powers
and its resolutions can still be over-
ruled by Canberra.
The history of Northern Territory
voting rights in Federal Parliament is
dismal. From Federation until 1911 the
Territory got by with only a Member
in the South Australian Parliament. In
1911 it lost him—when the Common-
wealth took it over, it was given no
seat in Federal Parliament.
In 1922 a group of Darwin men
refused to pay taxes without representa-
tion. They were packed off to jail, but
the publicity forced the Government
to give the Territory one Member in
Parliament, although it restricted his
voting rights to matters directly con-
cerning the Territory.
Despite several attempts by the Labor
Member for the Territory, Jock Nelson,
to get full voting rights, this situation
continued until the Country Party cap-
tured the seat at the 1966 elections.
The new CP Member, Sam Calder, a
Northern Territory property owner who
had campaigned on a platform of full
voting rights, immediately began a war
of attrition against Government
obstinancy. He capped his campaign


by leading a parade through Alice
Springs wearing a gag.
Calder was helped by powerful
allies. The Country Party was anxious
to retain its hold on the new seat and
backed Calder, and his backing helped,
since the Minister for the Interior, who
administers the Electoral Act, is a
Country Party colleague.
The Government finally agreed to
give the Northern Territory Member
full voting rights in the first Parliament
after the next election, which is not
due until 1969. But with some added
pressure from the Country Party
Leader, John McEwen, the Prime Min-
ister suddenly announced in March
that full voting rights would be granted
at once.
The debate on the enabling legisla-
tion in Parliament last week quickly
settled down to a slugging match be-
tween the Government and the Oppo-
sition about who deserved the credit.
But to Territorians who inhabit one
sixth of the Australian continent
the real question is: when do they get
self-government?
While claiming that its long-term aim
for the Territory is self-government,
the Government shows no signs of pro-
viding an answer. Dr. Rex Patterson, a
Labor MHR and former director of
the Northern Division of the Depart-
ment of National Development, said in
the debate on full voting rights: “The
Government believes in government of
the Northern Territory from Canberra,
by departmental persons, many of
whom, I regret to say, have never been
to the Territory. Those who have been
there have a knowledge of the Territory
restricted to the streets, hotels, and
motels of Darwin, or the air route from
Canberra to that city.”
Sam Calder has as his next target
the replacement of the three Govern-
ment-nominated Members of the Terri-
tory’s Legislative Council by elected
Members, giving the Council 11 elected
Members and six others who hold seats
because they head local government
agencies.
But even this move would not bring
much benefit for Territorians in the
way of self-government unless the
Federal Government decided to hand
over some of its powers to the Council
• a prospect which at present appears
very dim.
ECAFE
Paper tiger?
AFTER TWELVE dreary days, the
24th session of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Asia and
the Far East’s major result seemed
to be the production of five tons of
documented material. With 300 dele-
U Nyun...“we are the unwanted child of the United Nations”
gates and a dozen newspapers and
agencies to be served, ECAFE’S edi-
torial services seemed stretched to the
limit providing copies of speeches,
Press releases, reports, and submissions.
But, despite the huge volume of paper
amassed over the 12 days, the results
of the conference still seemed neg-
ligible.
A plan to supply all the delegates
with duty-free liquor may have livened
things a little, but it never eventuated.
And with half bottles of beer selling
for 65 cents in the motel where the
Conference was staged, most delegates
chose to wait for the daily round of
cocktail parties and diplomatic recep-
tions, held on an average of two a
night, for their relaxation.
Compared with the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Develop-
ment (UNCTAD), held in New Delhi
a few months ago, ECAFE was a dis-
"mal failure in the paper-production
stakes. UNCTAD managed to produce
75 tons of material, distributed to more
than 2000 delegates. But in terms of
results ECAFE and UNCTAD were
pretty much the same.
At the beginning of the ECAFE
meeting in Canberra, delegates from
all the developing countries pointed
out UNCTAD’S failure to provide
worthwhile trade developments, and
most hailed the ECAFE meeting as
a means of bringing more pressure on
the world’s rich nations to lower their
trade barriers and give meaningful
tariff concessions to exports from the
world’s poorer countries. But the
atmosphere of gloom, present from the
start when delegates pointed out that
Asia’s export earnings were falling
despite increased production, never
lifted.
The Asians argued that their main
products for export were such com-
modities as sugar, rubber, tea, rice;
not having the resources of the rich
nations they were unable to compete
on the world markets with manufac-
tures, so export earnings had to come
from the commodities at a time when
commodity prices throughout the world
are, to say the least, unstable.
The result was that in the first six
months of 1967 the ECAFE region’s
trade deficit reached $5206 million
compared with a deficit of $3577 mil-
lion for 1966. In several countries the
decline in export earnings equalled—
or exceeded—the amount of aid from
overseas. Little wonder, then, that
developing nations such as Thailand,
Malaysia, and Indonesia were calling
for trade benefits instead of straight out
financial aid.
But, with the exception of remarks
from the Australian delegation, the
Asian pleas seemed to have fallen on
deaf ears. Australia originated a
scheme of extending tariff preferences
to exports from developing nations.
Since the scheme was introduced in
April, 1966, it has been progressively
widened and now covers some 270
items. Quotas apply, giving each
developing producer a chance to gain
access to the Australian market.
Observers were surprised when, fol-
lowing the developing nations’ pleas for
greater access to markets, the Assistant
Secretary of the Department of Trade,
Mr. J. R. Richardson, revealed that
Asian nations were not making full
use of the Australian system.
One of the biggest surprises of the
Conference came on the second last
day, when ECAFE executive secretary
U Nyun launched into a bitter denunci-
ation of the lack of United Nations,
support for the ECAFE region. It was
“heartrending,” he said, that ECAFE,
with 2000 million people, received only
the same budget as either Latin
America or Africa, each with only about
300 million people. “Sometimes I feel
we are the unwanted child of the
United Nations,” he said, adding, “We
are not only the poor relatives of the
United Nations, but also the distant
relatives.” Asia, and ECAFE itself, was
being forced to take the “poor man’s
approach” begging money from
wherever it could. Yet after the speech
neither U Nyun, members of the secre-
tariat, or UN information officers were
able to say either how much ECAFE
l'eceived in the last UN budget or how
much it would seek in the next.
In the long run, U Nyun’s contribu-
tion and the contributions of all the
other delegates were only words. And
the last things Asia needs today are
words and paper.

OVERSEAS
Fighting the peace in Paris
A Johnsonian gesture accompanied LBJ’s announcement at a White House Press
conference (attended by Mrs. Johnson) of agreement to talk peace in Paris
Paris at the weekend was in need of
some peace, too, from student riots
THE MEETING in Paris this week
between America and North Vietnam
is the first step on what it is gener-
ally assumed will be a long and tor-
tuous road to a Vietnam settlement.
It is a recognition by both sides that
a political rather than purely military
solution might be possible. But this
does not mean that either side will
neglect military opportunities which
might be thought to influence the
negotiations. Both may indeed pursue
the strategy attributed to the Hanoi
revolutionary war theorists of “fight
and negotiate.”
Nevertheless, it is not inevitable that
the search for settlement should, as
some American leaders fear, follow the
pattern of the Korean armistice talks,
which dragged on for two years, dur-
ing which heavy casualties continued.
The next few months before the
American elections could be crucial for
both sides. For Hanoi this period offers
possibly the maximum opportunity for
a negotiated settlement: they are
already relieved of at least part of the
burden of American bombing, while
the American administration will be
under its maximum pressure at home.
This may be why Ho Chi Min has seen
this as too good a chance to be missed.
And the circumstances might never be
quite so propitious for him again, what-
ever the- American election results. For
a new American president, whoever he
might be and whatever his election
promises about peace, would be politic-
ally under less domestic pressure to
make concessions to achieve a quick
peace than President Johnson now, des-
pite his decision not to stand again.
For the Americans this period of
domestic competition also offers a
psychologically favorable opportunity
to disengage. They might otherwise
be dragged into a prolonged and bloody
stalemate at the expense also of many
other vital home and foreign interests.
But the Americans have a greater
interest than Hanoi and the South Viet-
nam National Liberation Front (Viet
Cong), in seeking a truce if no political
agreement can be achieved.
At least part of the American admini-
stration’s aims would be furthered if the
scale and intensity of the war could be
reduced and a greater share in con-
ducting it could be handed over to an
enlarged South Vietnamese Army. For
Hanoi and the Front, on the other hand,
a de-escalation which was not accom-
panied by any political gains in South
Vietnam might appear less attractive.
Thus, if the Paris meetings lead on
to broader talks, Hanoi and the NLF
will be chiefly concerned to explore
how far America is really prepared to
go toward a political settlement.
America will be seeking ways of. ending
or at least reducing hostilities with the
minimum political concessions to the
NLF.
Officially, Hanoi sees the first task of
the Paris talks as the creation of what
they say is the necessary condition for
peace negotiations—that is, an end to
all American bombing, which still
extends 200 miles into North Vietnam
up to the twentieth parallel, though it
now spares Hanoi, Haiphong, and other
densely populated areas. But for this
the Americans will want a military
quid pro quo.
They will want at least an assurance
that Hanoi would not exploit the cessa-
tion of bombing to rush extra supplies
and reinforcements into the south. At
most they might demand a reduction
of these supplies and of the level of
Viet Cong offensive operations in the
south. One difficulty here is for Hanoi
to admit publicly that there are any
North Vietnamese troops in the south:
they might also counter with a demand
that American supplies or reinforce-
ments to the south be reduced.
If the first talks can get as far as
an agreed cessation of all bombing of
the north with some military assurance
from Hanoi, the way would be open
for negotiations proper. Indeed, Hanoi
has now said that the Paris talks them-
selves might go on to wider matters.
The Americans would like to see a
ceasefire as the first item on the agenda,
but they and the Saigon Government
even more dislike the idea of a for-
mal ceasefire based on recognition of
areas controlled by each side, as hap-
pened in Laos. They fear this would
mean recognising the NLF’s authority
over at least part 6f South Vietnam.
The recent Tet offensive, showing the
Viet Cong’s ability to penetrate the
cities as well as the countryside, has
been a further proof that in practice it
would be difficult to conclude a terri-
torial ceasefire or anything like the
Korean armistice. While there could be


a military standstill, as in the final
stages in Algeria, it would have to be
coupled with political discussions.
And here at once a major obstacle
can be expected: the question of who
is to take part in the second stage of
political talks. The United States will
not object to the participation of the
NLF, but may insist on treating it not
as a separate South Vietnam political
entity, but as a mere extension of
Hanoi. Hanoi will insist that the NLF
is the sole legitimate representative of
the South Vietnamese people and refuse
to regard the Saigon Government as
anything but an American puppet.
Whether on this basis each side will
nevertheless tolerate the presence of
both the Saigon Government and the
NLF at the conference table remains to
be seen.
If this problem—on the surface only
one of procedure—can be solved, it
would be a pointer toward the solution
of what is really the central issue of all
—who is to be the Government of
South Vietnam and how is this to be
decided. If neither the present Saigon
Government nor the NLF has proved
capable of imposing its will on the
whole country by military means,
despite help from its friends, can it
form a coalition or agree on some non-
military means of decision?
A comparison between the public
negotiating positions of America on the
one hand and Hanoi and the NLF on
the other shows that on several im-
portant issues they agree. Both sides
say they want a settlement based on
the Geneva Indo-China Armistice
Agreements of 1954. They both accept
neutrality for Vietnam and the eventual
withdrawal of foreign troops. They both
want self-determination for South Viet-
nam and reunification by agreement
between north and south.
Until recently Hanoi and the NLF
insisted on complete withdrawal of
American troops as a condition of nego-
tiations: but there have been indications
that they now want only prior agree-
ment in principle that the withdrawal
will be part of a settlement. At the
Manila Conference in 1966 America
and Saigon agreed that American troops
would be withdrawn at Saigon’s request
six months after peace and order had
been restored in South Vietnam.
But it is on the most important issue
of all—who should rule in Saigon—that
all the rest depends. Even if there is
acceptance of a coalition, which the
Communists would dominate, there will
still be many questions to be answered.
What guarantees can there be against
the massacre or persecution of com-
mitted anti-Communists such as the
Catholic refugees from North Vietnam?
"What guarantees can there be of Viet-
nam’s international neutrality?
How are the two rival armies of
Saigon and the NLF themselves to be
'merged if there is a coalition? What
help can be given in the massive recon-
struction that will be needed in both
South and North Vietnam? All these
problems may require not only interna-
tional aid but also some agreed interna-
tional political and military presence
for a transition period. It is to consider
such things that the great powers will
have to be brought into the final stages
of negotiations as at the Geneva Con-
ference, and among them not only
Russia, but China.
While Moscow has long been known
to favor negotiation, Peking is at the
moment still urging Hanoi and the
NLF to fight on. But if it sees that the
U.S. really means to withdraw its forces
from the South-East Asia mainland in
the event of some compromise being
found in South Vietnam, it might yet
find it in its interest to take its place
at the conference table with the other
great powers of the world as it did in
Geneva in 1954 and again at the Laos
conference in 1962.
Malaysia-Singapore
Coming or going?
From HARVEY STOCKWIN,
in Kuala Lumpur
THE STORY goes that while Burma’s
General Ne Win was in Kuala Lumpur
recently he asked the Malaysians
“What about Australia?” in relation to
the regional future, and the Malaysians
were at a loss for a clear and specific
answer. While Australian Defence
Minister Fairhall’s statement on defence
on Friday vied in newspapers here on
Saturday for space with, and was very
much subordinated to, the announce-
ment that Paris was the site for Viet-
nam peace talks, it is likely that the
Malaysian and Singapore uncertainty
as to Australia’s intentions will remain
as a result of it.
Recently, when I asked whether
Australia’s delay in making its future
intentions clearly known was disap-
pointing, Singapore Foreign Minister
Rajaratnam dissented—“at least when
their mind is made up you know they
really mean it.” Fairhall’s statement
leaves one wondering whether it might
not have been better had silence been
further suspended.
His remarks which caught the
“Straits Times” headline for ex-
ample, “Aussies may not retain troops
at present level”—-will almost certainly
provoke the comment as to whether
there will be any commitment at all,
since both Terendak and Butterworth
bases are serviced by British support
troops.
Further, while uncertainty pending
the Vietnam outcome is understand-
able and while nobody imagines or ex-
pects Australia to take Britain’s place
in toto, the hard fact remains that
words imply commitment and should
not be filled with too many qualifica-
tions. To say, therefore, that “it should
not be assumed that any contributions
we may make would necessarily retain
the form or composition or be
maintained at the levels of the forces
presently in Malaysia and Singapore”
adds further doubts to inevitable hedg-
ing.
The main unanswered question is,
after all, a political one unrelated to
levels of military forces. Hoping for the
development of regional security
arrangements (in any event a long way
off) proclaiming Australia to be in the
grip of history in the making is second-
ary to a single question: what kind of
history and role does Australia see for
herself? As reported here, Fairhall
offered nothing clearcut. Rather the
announcement, reported the same day
as the statement that Prime Minister
Gorton’s Asian visit would be truncated
due to his visit to Washington, un-
happily implied the answer, and that
Australia was not yet ready to take
a grip on history herself. Unless the
statement is followed up with so'me
neat reassuring diplomatic footwork,
Rajaratnam will presumably still be
wondering what is really meant, while
Tun Razak, Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister, having left for Europe pro-
claiming Malaysia will still be looking
for Commonwealth assistance, will have
additional reason for seeking more
friends.
Razak. . .pushing Malaysian interests
Shopping for aid
ASKED IF TAKING the Sabah claim
to the world court would diminish ten-
sion between Malaysia and the Philip-
pines, Tun Razak last week denied
that Malaysia was the cause of tension
and commented, “If you go back a
few hundred years you can make
claims on almost anything. If you


went back far enough, Denmark could
even lay claim to Britain.” Given the
deterioration in Manila-Kuala Lumpur
accord, it was an unexceptional remark
—except that the questioner was Euro-
pean and the Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister was addressing a Press con-
ference in Copenhagen.
Malaysia is not, of course, the
only ex-colonial country wherein the
concept of a “European” is so very
British as to be distinctly un-European.
Malacca came under Portuguese and
Dutch influence, but as things stand
now European influence of the non-
Anglo-Anzac kind is small, although
slightly increasing. Tun Razak’s trip to
Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France,
and West Germany betokens a Malay-
sian effort to make increasing interest
a two-way process not waiting for
Britain to become European first and
thereby following a strategy which
might well be emulated by Canberra
and Wellington. True European un-
interest and isolationism are realities
to which Mr. Hasluck has drawn atten-
tion during his lectures. True, too, that
Europe will remain isolated from con-
siderations which do not impinge upon
its self-interest.
However, departing for his tour,
Razak was naturally more concerned
to indicate Malaysian self-interest. All
the countries he is visiting during the
next three weeks are members of the
Consultative Committee on Aid to
Malaysia formed by the World Bank—
which the Malaysians are fond of refer-
ring to as a club or a consortium, even
though it is not as yet such. The
hope is for more aid.
The Razak tour marks a new strategy.
“Up to now our main sources of
aid have always been England, Austra-
lia, New Zealand, other Commonwealth
countries, and lately the United States
of America. Now we have to look for
aid and also close friendship with other
countries as well,” said the Tun before
his departure. “I also would like to in-
form them what is going on in our
country and what are our pressing prob-
lems.”
Specifically Razak will be conveying
an invitation to President de Gaulle
from the Malaysian Yang-Pertuan
Agong suggesting a visit soon. While in
Germany, France, Belgium, and Britain
fie will be shopping for military hard-
ware. In Britain the question of “sig-
nificant aid” will arise, with Razak hav-
ing last week expressed hopes that the
British delay in announcing the level of
their withdrawal aid means an upward
revision of the amount. Last, but by no
means least, on his way home Razak
will become first Malaysian Cabinet
Minister to visit Malaysia’s largest
natural rubber customer Russia.
Razak made a brief inflight stopover in
Moscow on the way to Europe, but be-
fore leaving admitted there had not
been enough time to arrange a visit in
the wake of the newly established diplo-
matic relations. By the end of the week
the Russians had demonstrated they had
both the time and the interest.
The Presidency
Alarm bells in the Nixon camp
EIGHT YEARS ago in the 1960 Presi-
dential elections the choice—and that
only a half one —-for the Republican
nomination lay between Richard Mil-
hous Nixon and Nelson Aldrich Rocke-
feller.
It is no doubt some kind of com-
mentary on the fate of a minority Party
in American politics that today-—almost
as if nothing had happened in the
interim—the battle should once again
be joined between the same two men.
It is not, however, quite the same
battle.
Nixon may still be the easy favorite,
but his position is by no means as
impregnable as even Rockefeller had
eventually to recognise it to be in 1960.
Eight years ago Richard Nixon was,
after all, the constitutional heir-
apparent: as Eisenhower’s Vice-
President he could be denied the
nomination only at the price of the
Party appearing to want to renege on
its own record. He was also then what
is known in the U.S. as a “comer” he
had never lost an election in his life—
and his meteoric rise in American poli-
tics —a Congressman at 33, a Senator at
37, Vice-President at 40—had about it
the aura of a copybook success.
Today, by contrast, Nixon cannot
Rockefeller...splendid start in lowa
help looking a somewhat shop-soiled
figure. The past two elections he has
fought (for the Presidency in 1960, for
the California Governorship in 1962)
he lost. He possesses no geographic
base, although he lives in New York
City, in the same luxury apartment
block as Rockefeller (in five years they
have only once been each other’s guest
at dinner), and he occupies no position
in the hierarchy of the State Party.
Like Adlai Stevenson in 1960 though
with none of his hesitation and irreso-
lution he is a private citizen trying
to make his comeback into official life.
According to the traditional rules of
the American political game, Governor
Rockefeller seems, at least on the sur-
face, to have much more going for him.
He is in possession of what has always
been the most powerful office in the
United States outside the Federal
Government. In three successive elec-
tions in New York he has shown just
the capacity to attract independent
voters that the Republican Party has
to have behind it if it is to win national
elections. And, even at nearly 60, after
ten years in appointive posts in Wash-
ington and ten years’ elective politics
in New York, the impact his name
makes on the average voter remains one
of excitement and glamor.
But Governor Rockefeller’s target
audience, at least for the time being, is
not, of course, public opinion. Instead,
it has to be the local officials of the
Republican Party and that is the
rub. It has traditionally suited the
Democrats to portray the Republicans
as the Party of big business, personal
wealth, and the social establishment. If
it were, Nelson Rockefeller whose
announced list of backers already reads
like something out of an American
“Debrett” would have no worries.
But, predominantly, the Republicans,
at least so far as active Party workers
are concerned, belong to small-town
Nixon ... nomination not sewn up
America. They are the Elks, the
Rotarians, the Kiwanis, the Legion-
naires precisely wooed by Richard
Nixon down the years on “the fried
chicken and peas circuit,” at innumer-
able lunches and dinners where the
virtues of hard work, patriotism, and
thrift are traditionally extolled. To
people of this sort, a man like Nelson
Rockefeller with his silver-spoon
family inheritance, his divorce after 32
years of marriage, his belief in big
government spending program is not
only alien: he is also in some way sus-
pect.
Fundamentally, therefore, Nelson
Rockefeller faces the same problems


that he did in 1960. He will never win
the Party’s heart, he can only appeal to
its head. And that means conclusively
demonstrating between now and August
that he represents the Party’s best (and
perhaps only) hope of gaining back the
White House after eight years of Demo-
cratic occupation.
Last week that effort certainly got off
to a splendid start. His write-in vic-
tory, if only by a hair’s breadth over
both a favorite-son Republican Gover-
nor and an until - then invincible
Richard Nixon in the Massachusetts
primary, was in Rockefeller’s own re-
vealing words, “The first big break I’ve
ever had in this Presidency thing.” It
was all the more potent for being en-
tirely unexpected.
It was, ironically enough, Richard
Nixon who only 12 hours earlier had
slyly announced that he thought it
would be possible to get some indica-
tion of Rockefeller’s strength from the
write-in votes he obtained in the out-
standing primaries, and Rockefeller
himself who had shrewdly backed away
from having his prospects linked to any
unofficial write-in efforts made on his
behalf.
The upset in Massachusetts a’so came
at just the right moment for the
psychological strategy behind the
Governor’s campaign sweeps, the first
of which was a highly encouraging
foray into lowa last week. With a
realistic appraisal of what is feasible
at the beginning of his campaign,
Rockefeller is not demanding any com-
mitments from State delegations: in-
stead he is urging the virtues of remain-
ing uncommitted so far as the conven-
tion is concerned. .
Nothing could have helped this
“soft sell” approach more than the
sudden demonstration that Richard
Nixon might not have the Republican
nomination sewn up after all. No one,
least of all a thrustful local American
politician, willingly takes any un-
necessary risk of being associated with
another man’s failure.
Governor Rockefeller can certainly
look back on his first week of active
candidature with some satisfaction.
Whether he can yet look forward to
his own nomination with any confidence
is another question and one that re-
mains very much dependent not just on
opinion polls but on the harsh realities
of internal Republican Party politics.
If one thing is causing every alarm bell
to ring in the Nixon camp, it is the
growing suspicion that an alliance is in
the process of being forged between
the Party’s two most powerful Gover-
nors, Ronald Reagan of California and
Nelson Rockefeller of New York.
Each may have his own competing
ambitions for the White House, even
his own contrasting ideas of what a
Republican President should do once
installed there: but for the moment
they are tied together by a common
purpose stopping Richard Nixon,
the front runner, from simply walking
away with the nomination. National
tickets and an eventual Rockefeller-
Reagan combination is already the Re-
publicans’ dreamboat and the Demo-
crats’ nightmare have been built be-
fore now on foundations a good deal
less substantial than that.
Germany
The noise of the
jackboots grows
BEHIND THE weedy moat of a coun-
try house in the Rhineland the political
leaders of West Germany gathered last
week in emergency session. Schloss
Heimerzheim, borrowed on the instant
from a good-natured baron, is Chancel-
lor Kiesinger’s idea of a pressure-
cooker in which appetising new policies
can be steamed up in the shortest pos-
sible time.
It is an effort to dish up ideas im-
pressive enough to hold a slipping
situation.
Eastern Europe must be reassured
that the Government is not turning
neo-Nazi. Western neighbors and allies
must not be allowed to conclude that
Kiesinger’s part of Germany is drifting
dismasted by internal crises. And the
West Germans themselves must be
shown that their political structure,
wobbly as it has become, is still full of
valuable ideas.
Like the House of Usher, the walls of
political certainty seem to be rushing
asunder. Popular men find their support
drying up. Fierce nobodies become
oracles. Despised minorities grow sud-
denly formidable and find a hearing.
The elections in Baden-Wurttemberg,
more than anything, decided Kiesinger
to borrow the baron’s castle.
Last week’s polling brought the Fas-
cistic National Democrats almost ten
percent of the vote, their best ever in a
State election, and hacked down the
Social Democrats by no less than eight
percent. That was one horn of discon-
tent: the other the devastating Easter
weekend of rioting by Left-wing youth.
On May Day in West Berlin more
zigzag cracks in the wall of certainties
appeared. The “Extra-Parliamentary
Opposition” (the Left-wing rebellion to
which Rudi Dutschke belongs) staged
a May Day march in competition to the
official function and brought out some
30,000 people.
The grand coalition, the crushingly
strong parliamentary alliance of Chris-
tian and Social Democrats, provokes
growing extremism on both flanks. But,
as Chancellor Kiesinger said, the coali-
tion can’t be blamed exclusively for the
rise of the National Democrats: they
had already scored sensational votes in
Bavaria and Hesse before the new
Government was formed. Nor can the
Easter rioters carry the can.
Some component in West German
politics has ceased to function as it
should. And it is pretty clear which
component that is. The key to the
whole situation—the impatience with
compromise, the gathering contempt for
Parliament, the sense of powerlessness
in big layers of the population—lies in
the wooden hutments overgrown with
flowering creeper which are the Social
Democrat headquarters in Bonn.
When Hitler died, the SPD revived
as a Socialist workers’ party. Today, its
leaders run an all-class consumers’
policy, and are content to leave
Socialism to Dutschke or the East Ger-
mans. Ten years ago, at Bad Godes-
berg, the Party decided to drop planks
like nationalisation and neutrality. The
machinery passed even more into the
hands of Herbert Wehner, the repented
Communist who preserved his belief
in iron party discipline. Eighteen
months ago Wehner overrode the
doubts of Willy Brandt, Party Chair-
man, and brought the SPD into a grand
coalition.
It is hard now to deny that this was
a catastrophic mistake. In the first
place, there was at once a shedding of
Left-wing membership. Secondly,.
Wehner’s basic calculation that the
Christian Democrats would quarrel
while the SPD impressed the nation by
its unity and creativity totally failed.
The SPD vote kept sinking.
Two things now look unavoidable at
next year’s general election. One is
that the National Democrats will get
some 30 seats in the Bundestag. The
other is that the SPD will be slaugh-
tered. Baden-Wurttemberg is only the
last of many warnings. In fact, dead-
lock could emerge in the Bundestag,
with the SPD—once bitten —refusing
to renew the coalition, and the
Christian Democrats the largest party,
but lacking a majority. Unless, of
course, they offer a share in govern-
ment to those interesting newcomers
the National Democrats. But Kie-
singer’s stomach, it may be hoped, is
too delicate for that.

What’s left of Whitlam?
By DONALD HORNE
Whitlam after re-election to the leadership ... “one more victory like this and Gough will be defeated”
AT THE Sydney University Revue in
1940 Gough Whitlam played the Prime
Minister. It was not the Prime Minister
of Australia—that role was then in the
hands of R. G. Menzies. He played
Neville Chamberlain. His part was only
a small one, but it came on at the end
—to raise the roof and lower the cur-
tain. Until the arrival of Gough Cham-
berlain there was that kind of meaning-
less confusion on the stage that is not
uncharacteristic of university revues.
But when he arrived—bowler hat, um-
brella—and moved to the footlights
there was silence. “I have seen their
leader,” said Gough Chamberlain (and
since it was only two years after Munich
everyone knew which leader that
meant). “And I have his reply.” Out
of his pocket he pulled that necessary
feature of university revues, a roll of
toilet paper. He held the paper up
so that all could see. “It bears his
mark and mine,” he added. LOUD
LAUGHTER. (Pregnant pause). “And
I told him what to do with it.”
The anecdote raises two questions
that are relevant to the future of Whit-
lam, of the Labor Party, and of Aus-
tralia. The first question is: does Whit-
lam act as someone who really knows
It is the Labor Party he is leading or
is he still playing a part in some uni-
versity prank? The second question is:
so far as the Labor Party goes, while
Whitlam can obviously raise the roof,
will he also be the man who brings
down the final curtain?
To answer the second question, one
must first answer the first. How real is
Whitlam? Real to the public as a
national leader? Real to his party as
a Labor leader? Since in its worst
frenzies of claustrophobia the Labor
Party itself seems unreal to the Aus-
tralian public, the two questions are
quite different. But, for the moment,
this month anyway, the answer to both
of them would seem the same: Whit-
lam has lost credibility.
To begin with, so far as the public
was concerned, he had a lot of things
going for him. It is true that there was
nothing much Whitlam could do im-
mediately about the Labor Party’s
. greatest electoral problems. Disbelief
in Labor as a Party that looked as if
it could run the country came partly
from wounds that Whitlam could not
at once cauterise for some its
foreign policy made the Party directly
undesirable and for others who were
not concerned so directly with foreign
policy the divisions within the Party
on this issue nevertheless made it seem
a split-up, silly-looking Party that
didn’t know its own mind. These two
problems came from the very nature
of Whitlam’s inheritance, although even
with these he was showing considerable
promise as a paperhanger, a useful
trade in an edifice that is all cracks.
But where his greatest advantage lay
was that he was not Arthur Augustus
Calwell.
For one thing Whitlam was couth, a
characteristic Australians now seem to
look for in a politician: and whatever
else might be said about Mr. Calwell,
he did not look like the world of today.
For another thing, Whitlam had a feel-
ing for the present aspirations of the
electorate: he was not likely to imagine
that it was 1917 all over again and that
a decisive issue was whether Australians
should be conscripted for the Western
Front, or Vietnam, or wherever it was.
He had the right beliefs about modern
styles, about involvement with Asia,
and the other characteristics of those
who walk soberly down the centre of
the path of progress. Above all, what
he had working for him was the desire
of many Australians that there should
be a political leader of a certain kind
and, whether Whitlam met its specifica-
tions or not, they were prepared to
write him into the part. Only the
natural tendency of the Labor Party
to fall to bits or Whitlam’s own actions
(or both) could destroy these assets.
At this particular moment the Labor
Party and its leader have both watered
these assets down.
For a while Whitlam had another
thing going for him. As Harold Holt
faltered so unexpectedly over the
wretched VIP aircraft affair, Whitlam
showed a healthy instinct for poking
at Government weaknesses. His Opposi-
tion showed a greater liveliness than
Calwell’s and the results went up on
the board in the Senate election at the
end of last year. But Whitlam seems to
have been on the rebound ever since.
He has shown a surprising incapacity
to get the measure of John Gorton.
While all kinds of supporters of the
Liberal and Country Party Coalition
Government have been privately criti-
cising its performance, Whitlam seemed
unable to make a public dramatisation
of its weaknesses. For those who get
their politics from watching TV per-
formances the big question this year
has not been What’s John Gorton like?
but Is Gough Whitlam sincere?
The over-exposure on television . . .
the slightly anxious, slightly ingratia-
ting leaning toward the microphone, as
if it was only by this particular move-
ment that he could get real relief . . .
the too frequent (and too neat) smiles
. . . the shifting around and shuffling
of Labor Party policies ... the disas-
trous (if innocent) grin when a photog-
rapher was knocked down by the door
of his car . . . all of these lacked that
gravitas, that sense of seriousness and
purpose, that is still the safest and the
best role for a politician. Whitlam came
through as someone who was anxious
to please. But .did he come through as
someone who believed in certain things
and who was determined to get them
done?
There were other moments. When he
wasn’t trying, when he didn’t know
the cameras were on him, Whitlam
could look serious enough, with a thick-
ness of jowl and apparent determination
of purpose that provided a weird re-
minder of Menzies in his younger days.
But against these rare appearances of
another Whitlam was the already estab-
lished reputation for petulance. The


time he chucked a glass of water at
Mr. Hasluck has not been forgotten.
What could have been made seem
acts of strength were sometimes inter-
preted as the actions of a man who
was in a pet.
Gough Whitlam suffers from a weak-
ness unusual in a politician. He isn’t
sure how to behave in public. Ques-
tions as to his sincerity are really non-
sense. Except for true believers who
would sooner burn than marry power
except on their own terms (which
never work), politicians in a democracy
must necessarily mix expediency with
principle. This is very largely what
democracy is supposed to be about,
since most of the expediencies they re-
spect are their interpretation of the
weight of important forces within the
community. Whitlam is as sincere as
the next politician, and more sincere
than many. But there has remained
in his public conduct a kind of aggres-
sive, if unccnfident, undergraduate
streak in which he sometimes seems to
be sending himself up, like a self-
conscious performer in a Union Night
debate.
Anyone who has spent a few minutes
with politicians in their off-duty
moments knows that they can be as
childish as anyone e'se. In fact some
of the most famous or most infamous
of politicians achieved their success
mainly because they were so infantile:
they were psychiatric cases who pro-
jected their childishness into serious
purposes. Yet, in the tough life of
politics, Whitlam is not one of the
great clowns. What undoes him is this
itch to show some of his private self
in public. At times he’s almost like
the interviewee who suddenly says into
the microphone: Look, Mum, it’s me.
It is not, however, mainly for this
reason that Whitlams are now selling at
a low price on the political exchange.
Whitlam has been devalued mainly by
the umpteenth act of self-immolation in
the tragi-comedy of the dissolution of
the Australian Labor Party. It is true
that if he had more clearly established
his own popular appeal, this might have
given him some extra strength in his
dealings with the curators of that liv-
ing museum in which the Labor Party
houses itself. But it is also true that
the inadequacies of the Labor Party
have been Whitlam’s main obsession
this year. Indeed, to be fair, one might
perhaps attribute some of his decline in
public performance to this private pre-
occupation.
But here comes the next question, an
odd one to ask of a Labor leader, but
a real one. Does Gough Whitlam
really understand the Labor Party?
Whether it is Right Wing, Left Wing,
or split half and half, the extra-parlia-
mentary political machine of the Labor
Party is something that the Party’s
leader must always take into account.
He must know its nerves and sinews
and impulses as if they were an exten-
sion of his own body. Even a Party
leader who becomes Prime Minister
must still concern himself with the
manipulation of this clumsy and some-
-times rusty apparatus: the Party leader
has to make sure that the machine is
moving more or less in his direction,
or he must pull the machine to bits and
remake it to his liking. A prime
example of the first situation was that
John Curtin, even though he was war-
time leader of Australia, had to pay
attention to the wisdom of the Party
machine before making dispositions of
Australian troops in the South-West
Pacific. A prime example of the second
situation was that in the crisis of the
1954-55 splits Dr. Evatt as a Party
leader acted against the Party’s consti-
tution so that he could change the
machine and get one that suited his
purposes.
In addition to the task of manipula-
tion or of wrecking and reassem-
bling the Party leader has to pay
some token respect to' the ideology of
Dr. Jim Cairns..."talks the lingo"
the machine minders and the vocabul-
ary of their rhetoric. In its most fun-
damentalist form this rhetoric comes
from the origins of the Labor Party
and of “the working class movement.”
At heart it was inspired by the rnillen-
nial hopes of Christianity: that some-
time there would be a Great Change,
and then the evils of the world would
be cured. This change was to be ef-
fected only by the righteous, and the
pure in heart (viz., the Party). This
belief gave the Party a sacred character
so that it became the tiue cm-
bodiment of The People. It is the re-
tent ion, in some kind of crude outline,
of such rhetoric that accounts for much
ot the present Lelt-wing' hmdamen-
, b lv ,
talism. Like any other political party,
die Labor Party is, of course, merely
an oligarchy, or, more exactly, a group
of conflicting oligarchies: but the fun-
damentalists still speak of it as if it
were an instrument of revelation.
This vocabulary is similar to that
of the Communists, or at least of the
Stalinist Communists, and it eases
relations between some bits of the Left
and the various kinds of Communists
we have these days. In its emphasis
on purity it leads to the situation in
which some members of the machine
see themselves as stern men of prin-
ciple, uninterested in power, except on
their own terms. In addition, since the
Party is really oligarchical, it also
excuses the stiff-necked absolutism of
some of the machine minders. They
already have their power they are
secretaries, presidents, executive mem-
bers, or whatever and this means
more to them than having a Labor
Government. Add to these factors some
native sectarianism, and then add
liberal portions of “opportunists”
(which is to say people like the rest
of us), and you have the Labor
machine.
To get his machine to work his way,
Mr. Whitlam had either to 'manipulate
it, or to wreck it and remake it. As a
manipulator he has shown himself
remarkably aloof from the essential
techniques of manipulation getting a
majority of the numbers on all those
committees that are the arena of power
within the Labor Party. A good Num-
bers Man thinks of human beings in
terms of ticks, crosses, and question
marks. His voice is the telephone, his
heart is full of lists, his happiness is
the thought that the ayes have it. The
Party Leader should 'not himself be
such a person, but he must have
associates who are good at this. Mr.
Whit j am hasn’t got them . In his recent

°P m *° the Caucus for re-election,
although le-elected, he lost votes, so
that the comment was made: One
more victory like this, and Gough will
be defeated.’ Now he is again going
to attempt to get the numbers, this


time to call a special Federal Con-
ference of the Labor Party.
His policy is praiseworthy: he wants
to re-order the Labor Party so that it
cotnes closer to the aspirations of the
Australian people. If the Party were
again democratised in this way it would
make an effective Opposition and a
credible alternative Government. Even
some Liberal Party members now
believe that it would be to their
country’s and even their Party’s good
if Australia now returns to a situation
in which the Opposition looks as if it
could be the Government. But is Whit-
lam likely to succeed? The odds seem
against him.
Not least because the present crisis
shows a weakness not only in Whitlam’s
skill at the numbers game but also in
his contempt for traditional Labor
Party rhetoric. His contempt is under-
standable, but inexpedient. One of the
things about Whitlam that makes him
attractive to his fellow Australians is
Senators Murphy and Cohen turn up at last week’s Caucus meeting in Canberra
his obvious disdain' for some of the
hallowed claptrap of the Labor Party.
But this is nevertheless the environ-
ment in which he operates and it is
extraordinary that he does not use its
rhetoric more tt> his own purposes.
The old tricks of appearing to be the
-only true voice of unity and of dismiss-
ing opponents as impostors who are
false to the true traditions of Labor
seem to be beyond—or beneath—him.
To take another example: when the
Federal Executive at its last meeting
refused to accept Mr. Harradine’s
credentials as a Tasmanian delegate it
would have been possible for the Party
leader to denounce an Executive with-
out Tasmanians as a false Executive,
an illegal Executive, a usurper body
that was enforcing Labor disunity.
The Harradine case was in itself
instructive as an example of another
feature of the Labor Party with which
Whitlam has yet to display his sure-
ness of touch. These are the intransi-
gents of Labor’s Right—some of them
still in the Party, some of them fighting
a guerilla action, exiled to the DLP.
Although the exclusion of Mr. Harra-
dine was a matter settled largely on
Left-Right terms (perhaps with a touch
of sectarianism), it is also clear that
he had been very provocative, perhaps
deliberately so, in an intransigent
Right-wing way. If the possible con-
sequences of Tasmanian provocation
had already been considered in Tas-
mania, this would mean that the present
form of the Labor crisis has been set off
by Tasmania, not by Whitlam, and
that it may get beyond his control.
So far Whitlam has not shown him-
self very good as a manipulator of the
Labor Party. Will he—whether he
wants to or not —later find himself in
the role of a Right-wing Dr. Evatt
ready to split the Party again, and
ready to give it a go? Will he take
his opponents on in a final test as to
whether it is to be him or them? It is
to his credit that he obviously does not
see it as the summit of his career that
he should remain Leader of the Opposi-
tion. If he fails in the numbers game
will he, with that desperation that is
the true courage of politics, take a risk
and let the Australian people decide
which Labor Party they like best?
He and his associates have a fair
degree of strength. They have the
Tasmanian and N.S.W. Party machines
behind them and considerable, if dis-
organised, political support in the other
States. They have four Trades Halls
behind them (Melbourne, Sydney,
Adelaide, Hobart) and if they worked
at it they could get a fifth (Perth).
They have a majority on the Austra-
lian Council of Trade Unions and they
are backed by the Australian Workers’
Union. And they are, without doubt,
closer to Labor voters than their
opponents. Out of this potential a good
political leader would have some chance
of contriving success, if the Right-wing
support he would partly rely on did
not prove as equally intransigent as is
now the case with the fundamentalist
Left.
Such a boldness might, however,
require greater strength within the
Parliamentary Party than Mr. Whitla'm
now holds. In the numbers game it
seems significant that, after the Federal
Executive, his own Parliamentary Party
is one of his weakest positions. If he
had improved his role last week, he
would have been a different man.
Another dozen votes in the Labor
Caucus would have been of more use to
him than the support of four Trades
Halls.
Meanwhile, casting its shadow in Mr.
Whitlam’s path is the growing challenge
of Dr. Jim Cairns. Able to project a
more straightforward public personality
than Mr. Whitlam, equally able to pro-
ject a 'modern sense of style, but better
able to talk the lingo of the Labor
movement, Cairns is making an extra-
ordinary progress as a symbol of some-
thing or other. “Cairns would make
mincemeat of Gorton if he were Leader
of the Opposition,” says a member of
one of the governing Coalition Parties,
and in TV politics Cairns may now be
up on Whitlam on points. Within the
Labor Party even Cairns’ opponents
discuss the possibility that dramatic
changes in Atnerican policy in South-
East Asia and even toward Australia
could produce such an accompanying
change in the product differentiation
between the Australian political parties
that Cairns’ leftness wouldn’t be noticed
in the general wash-up. Amongst the
cynics the same question is asked of
Cairns as is asked of Whitlam by the
idealists, but for different reasons: Is
Cairns sincere? Is he a real funda-
mentalist, or is he that not unfamiliar
phenomenon in Australian politics—a
Left-winger who could move Right?
However, there are places where this
discussion does not go on. In the DLP
and in some sections of the Labor
Party they have already made up their
minds. They believe that Cairns means
what he says, and for that reason they
see him as one of their main enemies.
And for that reason if things still
stand more or less as they now do in
Australia a Labor Party led by
Cairns could be led to a memorable
electoral disaster.
Since political parties are oligarchies,
with their own histories, there seems
no excuse in saying that a nation has
the government it deserves. Nor
would there seem any sense in saying
that Australia has the Labor Party it
deserves. But the fact that Australia is
so dis-served by the Labor Party means
that Australian politics continues to be
unusually lifeless and um-esponsive at
the very time in history when events
seem to be demanding of Australians
quickness in action and readiness to
change. So far as one can judge such
things, it seems likely that there is
greater potential in the Australian
people than political leadership has
brought forth. But it is difficult to see
which political leaders are likely to
bring it forth.


Oh, what a wonderful Crisis!
SHARE PRICES are booming around
the world; it is not just the Australian
stockmarkets that are setting records.
Share prices in London have risen
even faster so far in 1968 than they
have in Australia, where the bulk
of the 22 percent rise so far this year
has been due mainly to only two
stocks, BHP and Western Mining
Corporation, and where most of the
market is still pretty low. In Japan,
the market has jumped about 12 per-
cent; in the United States it has re-
gained all the losses it suffered early
this year when Vietnam looked as if
it would go on for ever and the
economy would go bad; in Paris,
Frankfurt, and Amsterdam markets are
all pointed upwards as investors around
the world are on a buying spree.
Yet the world is supposed to be in a
crisis over money, the worst since 1931
according to the man who runs the
U.S. monetary system, William Mc-
Chesney Martin, who last month
warned America that unless taxes rose
and the economy cooled off the U.S.
could be in for either uncontrollable
recession or uncontrollable inflation.
What is bringing so many buyers into
the market place and sending so 'many
share prices up through the roof? In
some markets there is a mixture of good
results from companies (or hopes of
them) with the prospect that a serious
bout of inflation could be on the way
(and shares provide one of the best
hedges against inflation, as they gener-
ally rise in sympathy with the fall in
the value of money). But in America
the main hope is for peace.
In Australia, the answer is clearly
minerals, mixed with a large dash of
British investment. The massive 'mineral
and oil discoveries, added to last week
with major increases in BHP’s oil re-
serves in Bass Strait (which could end
up being the world’s biggest off-shore
oil field) and Western Mining’s nickel
at Kambalda (which could end up
being the world’s biggest nickel field),
have brought a flood of British funds
into the Australian market.
Turnovers have more than trebled
as brokers (now worried more by
shortages of staff than of clients) are
making even more money than they
did in the 1960 boom. Sydney’s mining
turnover for the first quarter of 1968
was almost as much as mining turnover
for the whole of the last financial year.
In the first three months of 1968,
about $lOO million of British portfolio
funds came into Australia. This fol-
lowed the $l5O million of the previous
six months and gave an annual rate so
far this financial year of about $330
million a year compared with last
year’s total share turnover on the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange of only $360
million. Without the British 'money the
Australian market would suffer.
But there is no doubt that Australia’s
mineral prospects have never been
better; stimulated by the boom itself,
more money is now being spent on ex-
ploring for minerals than ever before
in the country’s history. It is inevitable
that this spending will bring increasing
rewards in discoveries of new deposits
of minerals and oil, which will give
more fuel to the boom. The snowball
effect has quite a way to go yet.
All this British money has stuck
pretty closely to mining shares despite
the relatively high returns British inves-
tors can get from Australian shares; the
4.4 percent average dividend return
from Australian shares (the same as in
Japan) is better than on any other mar-
ket in Europe except Holland and is
way above America’s 2.9 percent.
So the rest of the Australian market,
outside oil and mining, has remained
fairly flat, with a few exceptions, as the
boom has passed it by. About a quarter
of all the shares listed on the Sydney
Stock Exchange are under par; BHP
alone accounts for about half the 70
percent rise in the Sydney share price
index over the past 12 months and
when rises in other companies whose
most exciting assets are shares in BHP
are taken into account (like J. Fielding
and Howard Smith), then BHP alone
has carried most of the market’s rise on
its back.
There is plenty more evidence of the
dullness of the non-mining section of
the market. Most of the big rises that
have taken place for a few industrial
shares have come from those with big
stakes in the mining boom.
The immediate outlook for in-
dustry in Australia is only modestly
good; the pace of industrial advance is
nothing dramatic, and the Government

wants to keep it that way for the next
few years while there is still so much
pressure on the balance of payments.
For Australia is simply not paying her
way in the world at present, and if it
were not for the astoundingly high price
of capital inflow (some, but only a
relatively small part, of which could
flow out again just as easily), our
foreign reserves would be falling.
Low wool, wheat, and sugar prices,
the drought, and devaluation have all
combined to knock many millions off
Australia’s export earnings at a time
when demand for imports is steadily
rising because of the country’s indus-
trial expansion. Until the major new
mineral developments contribute far
more to Australia’s export earnings than
they do now, say by the early 19705, or
unless wool prices unexpectedly rise,
there can be no likelihood of the Gov-
ernment allowing Australian industry to
expand at a much faster rate than it is
now.
Sooner or later, of course, there will
be a pay-off for the economy as a
whole (provided the rest of the world,
particularly Japan, continues to want to
buy the minerals we are finding in such
profusion). And then the whole of the
stockmarket should move forward. But
at present British investors won’t touch
Australian manufacturing company
shares and are even selling some of
their existing holdings to switch the
cash into the mining market.
The only non-mining shares that the
British have been buying are those in
service industries.
What about other parts of the world?
In Britain, where people “have never
had it so bad” for the past 19 years, the
stockmarket has bounded by 25 percent
so far in 1968 to' record heights. Fears
of inflation and a simple supply and
demand shortage of shares have joined
the basic reason for the rise fore-
casts that company profits should rise
by 15 percent over the next two years
as the nation recovers from its malaise,
thanks to the tough Wilson policies.
British investors are clearly hoping for
the same sort of economic recovery
that came last year to Germany follow-
ing a period of recession.
In America hopes of peace have over-
whelmed Mr. Martin’s double-package
fears of “uncontrolled recession” and
higher interest rates of a fortnight or
so ago. The market has continued its
recovery from the times earlier this year
when a recalcitrant Congress was refus-
ing to agree to the President’s plans to
increase taxes in order to hold the
economy in check; when the Vietnam
war looked like going on for ever; when
the dollar crisis was so bad that all
sorts of crisis measures were likely to
be used to solve it; and when company
profits, car and appliance sales all
looked like continuing their first quarter
falls as victims of Vietnam.
Since then, apart from the prospects
of peace in Vietnam, Wall Street also
likes the idea of Mr. Johnson not being
president next year. The danger is that
the peace talks may not appear credible
enough to please the market or
that they might fail, bringing another
escalation in Vietnam. Then what?
The “Economist” warns: “Nobody in
Wall Street would put it in these exact
words, but the best advice then would
be ‘scream and run.’ ”
In Germany, last year’s 45 percent
leap has been followed by a 'more sober
confidence as companies are now re-
porting the good news that the market
had hoped for; it seems that industry
generally managed to survive the recent
recession undented and is doing in-
creased business. Prices are still about
20 percent below their boom-time peak
of 1960, but some experts forecast that
they should rise a further 10 to 15
percent this year.
The Paris bourse is following the
German lead in 1968, now being at
around its peak for the year as the
Government’s reflationary measures
(and German buying because of pro-
spective tax changes) have helped it
along.
Ironically, the only European market
that looks weak is in Italy, the country
with the fastest rate of economic growth
in Europe. This year the market has
tnanaged to recover only about two per-
cent of last year’s five percent fall des-
pite a flow of good co’mpany results.
The volatile Tokyo market has risen
by about 12 percent so far this year
despite the country’s balance-of-pay-
ments problem as the Japanese are
hurrying to buy shares as a hedge
against inflation (like Australians they
are prevented by law from buying
gold). One of the reasons for such
broad interest in the Tokyo market
(apart from European money that
has been looking for a home there re-
cently) is that average share prices
look so cheap that even very small
investors can afford them; the average
price of Tokyo’s “Big Board” stocks is
about 25 cents.
So all the world’s major markets are
going up this year. Will they keep
doing so? It mainly depends on Viet-
nam for the U.S. market and all those
that depend on it and that probably
includes Japan, which could well mean
Australia. But the key thing about
Australian markets at present is that
British investors are pouring money
into Australia even though they can
make big profits in London’s buoyant
market. If the London market loses
its gloss, then there could be even more
British money looking for a home in
the lively Australian market.


Pope’s heresy
BY A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
PERHAPS MONTHS of drought had
left everyone a little on edge, but when
the Rev. Mr. David Pope, a young
Anglican clergyman in Melbourne, sug-
gested that the concept of God was
irrelevant, his beaming, bearded face
began vying for space with the faces
of Dr. Cairns and Mr. Whitlam.
Prayers were offered for his apostasy,
and some other, more down to earth
remedies were suggested.
A week after Easter, in an interview
with the “Herald,” Pope had said that
the word God had to be given a rest.
“The thing I want to get rid of is
religion.” Five days later his friend,
Peter Lane, priest-in-charge, Holy
Trinity Church, Kensington, put his
head alongside Pope’s on the block by
suggesting in a long letter that he, like
many others, found “the whole concept
of the supernatural to be irrelevant,”
and did not use it as an operative part
of his life.
The day after Pope’s delayed-action
bomb was planted, the Anglican Arch-
bishop of Melbourne (Dr. Woods) had
said the Church of England would not
take any action “as there was nothing
palpable in the vicar’s statement.” He
said he had a certain sympathy with
Mr. Pope. Letters the next day saw the
Archbishop on the road to damnation
with his embarrassing young friend.
On the following Tuesday one of the
two Coadjutor Bishops of Melbourne,
Geoffrey Sambell, declared that if he
held Mr. Pope’s views he would resign.
His Archbishop then agreed, speaking
that night at a suburban church on
what he believed about God, Christ,
and the Church.
Sunday saw a harassed hierarchy
requesting that a pastoral letter be read
from the pulpits to salve wounds caused
by these aberrations. It began, “Beware
that you be not like children tossed to
and fro and carried about with every
wind of doctrine.” It was a surprising
reaction considering Dr. Woods’ expres-
sion of sympathy with Pope, and his
own liberal theological beliefs.
Ironically this was the day of Holy
Trinity’s 50th anniversary and the
Archbishop had long before agreed to
conduct the anniversary service. As
Peter Lane had stood down from his
duties during the week, Dr. Woods con-
ducted the service alone, before a
larger-than-usual congregation. Press-
men took it all down. He said that
these radical views were but old
heresies in new clothes.
By Sunday night, Peter Lane and
David Pope had retreated to a polite
“no comment.” Worried and under-
standably afraid of being misquoted or
David Pope...winds of doctrine
misunderstood, they were both busy
preparing a statement of their con-
sidered positions for His Grace’s perusal
pn the coming Thursday.
The next week was given over to
television debates and Press interviews
after 12 more clergymen had entered
the melee, requesting serious debate,
and welcoming any attempt to restate
the meaning of the word “God.” These
were respectable “Ground of our being”
people, seemingly not as Left as the
agnostic “rebel vicars,” but one of the
signatories, Assistant Chaplain of the
elite Trinity College, said that, if sides
were to be taken, he was with the
rebels.
His superior, Dr. Barry Marshall,
the Chaplain of Trinity and a lecturer
in theology, on the previous night had
supported the rebels when interviewed
on a television program. As Chaplain
of Trinity, he is the spiritual guide of
the College’s High Church-tending
theological students. The fast-talking,
softly spoken friend of the Bishop of
Woolwich also said the pastoral letter
sat uneasily beside the Archbishop’s
“monumental” theological statement at
the 1967 Synod.
Next out was Melbourne University’s
Student Christian Movement. Co-
presidents and committee joined with
the 12 of the previous letter and re-
quested freedom and charity in the
controversy. They were answered last
Saturday by 28 Christians (including
two Ridley College staff) who “re-
affirm (ed) central truths about God.”
David Pope may not have helped
matters by calling for civil disobedience
against the Vietnam War on the same
day as his interview appeared. His
political activities had been causing
some people in the Anglican Church
anxiety for some time. Both he and
Lane are members of the ALP, and
besides wearing beards they are
involved in half a dozen causes.
But when the issue is boiled down,
Pope and Lane were saying no more
than some academic theologians have
been saying for years. We were, as
usual, Dr. Marshall said, ten years
behind. Although a traditionalist who
apprehends God “in a personal way,”
Barry Marshall also uses the term
“Christian agnostic” of himself. “The
term means that there are a lot of
things we don’t know. This doesn’t
mean that agnostics aren’t perfectly
secure in their faith. They are only
saying that the simple Christian faith
as held by some has no practical value
in certain situations in this country.”
The Archbishop last year in his
charge to Synod had dismissed the
super-person God, the “God of the
Gaps,” “God of Emergencies,” and the
purely religious God who looked favor-
ably only at the pious and religious.
To a generation brought up on the
Supreme Architect conception, and the
ineffable Watchmaker, this was not so
easy to absorb.
His Grace had also levelled his guns
at the Church of one class; one social
status; and one political interest. He
gave a hearty cheer for the secular
Christianity of social involvement.
While this was not really revolu-
tionary, many have regarded it as a
very fine presentation of the modern
position. Dr. Marshall called it “One
of the most important theological state-
ments made by a prelate in this
country.”
The charge to Synod came after more
than a century of profound theological
change, influenced by Kierkegaard,
Bonhoeffer, and other radical theolo-
gians. A century of rigorous biblical
criticism has suggested a historically
limited Jesus who spoke with a quite
different frame of reference, and with
quite opposite symbols. “Form” critic-
ism has suggested a Jesus, who, although
credited with being the Son of God,
did not make the claim himself.
A principle of looking at the under-
lying experience and understanding of
past Christian teachers, and not at the
literal expression of their ideas and
faith, has developed.
Woolwich selected ideas from radical
thinkers and put them in accessible
form. Supernaturalism was rejected, but

this was not an attack on the trans-
cendent “God” out there. The life for
others as lived by Jesus was seen as
the transcendental, because God was
found where ultimate love was given.
The Anglican hierarchy regards the
question of belief in some form of
transcendental being as the acid test.
Although the Archbishop was also
unavailable, his chaplain, the Rev.
James Grant, said the dispute rested
essentially on whether Pope and Lane
were prepared to admit that they be-
lieved in some idea of God, call it
“the ground of our being,” “over-
againstness,” or whatever. “While they
were right to reject the old ideas, the
question is whether they have put any-
thing in its place.” He said they may
have found themselves in the classical
heretical stance of being right in what
they affirm but wrong in what they
deny.
Mr. Grant said Dr. Woods had been
troubled to see so many honest folk
distressed, but that in another three
months, when people had been forced
to hammer out their ideas in the light
of what had been said, the debate
would have only been of value. “It
could be quite fun, actually.”
Dr. Leon Morris, the principal of
Ridley College, where both Lane and
Pope did their training, believes they
have stressed only one side of the
Christian message. “The New Testa-
ment is also interested in the Life be-
yond the grave.” Dr. Marshall, who
also knows them, agreed that “the
rebels” were negative. “ ‘Death of God’
theology is only a passing phase, a
preparatory clearing ground for much
deeper thinking and more profitable
approaches to God.”
Pope and Lane were placed in the
awkward position of having to justify
a non-theist theology which is still far
from mature formulation. Athough
they are not professional theologians,
they were asked to speak on an issue
Copernican in proportion. They were
representing not only the radical young
ministers and priests who have sought
the challenge of the inner suburbs and
the raw outer suburban communities
but also thousands of people who have
responded to the movement.
The Bishop of Woolwich does not
lay such unqualified stress on God as
a function of human relationships, but
then Pope and Lane are far from the
godless, religionless American theo-
logians like Altizer, Hamilton, Van
Buren, and others.
They say such things as “The theo-
logian must exist outside the church”;
“I do not see how preaching, worship,
prayer, ordination, the sacraments can
be taken seriously by the radical theo-
logians”; and, “The history of religion
is the history of spiritual degeneration.”
The furore caused by these thunderous
pronouncements is still echoing in
America.
By coincidence, the Melbourne
scandal happened as the drought was
breaking. Steady, soaking rain came
down and down.

INSTEAD OF THE
COMMON MARKET
An Anglo-
Saxon
entente
Douglas Jay ... “firmly and visibly in the British tradition”
THERE IS always some other new idea
coming up on the side. For the moment
the leading idea in Britain about what
Britain might do next is “entry into
Europe.” But in the 1950 s this idea
was a straggler at the end of the field.
What is worth watching now is another
straggling idea, that might later
make its run if the idea of entry into
Europe fails. The idea that could re-
place entry into Europe is clearly the
North Atlantic Free Trade Area
(NAFTA), an idea that is of particular
interest to Australians because—despite
its name —Australia could be part of it.
The present main spokesman for the
idea is Mr. Douglas Jay, a former
President of the Board of Trade. Late
last month he published a book, “After
the Common Market” (Penguin), that
is likely to become the first sacred text
of this new idea.
His basic assumption is that Britain’s
long-term aim is to achieve the widest
possible industrial free trade in close
association with those who have similar
political traditions to Britain and close
economic links. He points out that by
good fortune the group of countries
from which Britain buys most of its
basic imports are also broadly those
whose ideas are most similar to Britain’s
—the English-speaking Commonwealth,
the United States, and Scandinavia.
He says: “If it were possible to form
a freer trade zone based on this group,
with liberal access for the goods of all
developing countries, including India,
Pakistan, and the rest of the Asian
Commonwealth, Britain’s position
would be far more assured both politi-
cally and economically than by any
other arrangement.”
He sees such a free-trade zone being
built up either as the second stage of
a process in which Britain and the other
EFTA countries first form an industrial
free trade area with the Common Mar-
ket countries or if the Common
Market countries won’t come at it
he sees Britain, the United States,
Canada, and the Scandinavian countxies
forming their Atlantic Free Trade Area
and then inviting Australia, New Zea-
land, and Japan to come in if they
wished, and the Common Market coun-
tries, too.
The advantages he sees in such an
arrangement are that it would not
involve supranational control of
Britain’s internal affairs; that it would
not involve the taxing of food imports;
that it would not involve damage to
Commonwealth countries or loss of
Commonwealth preferences; that it
would mean that Britain was streng-
thening ties with its natural trading
partners; that it would mean Britain
was joining a free-trade area with
greater long-term growth prospects than
the Common Market and with a GNP
more than three times as great as the
Common Market’s; that Britain’s
balance of payments would benefit very
greatly from such an association,
whereas they would be damaged by
entering the Common Market; and that
Britain’s trade policies outside the free-
trade area would not be as constricted
as they would be if it joined the
Common Market.
Flis strategy is:
• Take advantage of de Gaulle’s
apparent offer of a freer trading
arrangement between the EFTA and
Common Market countries.
• If this succeeds, attempt to widen it
by including the United States and
Canada.
• If it fails—form NAFTA out of
Britain, the United States, Canada, and
EFTA.
• Then invite the other developed
industrial nations, notably Australia,
New Zealand, and Japan.
• At the same time draft in a policy
of generalised preferences for all poorer
countries.
Mr. Jay’s economic arguments are, of
course, debatable. But the economic
arguments for Britain’s entry into the
Common Market are even more debat-
able. In fact, some of the more per-
cipient supporters of British entry into
the Common Market admit that if
Britain goes into Europe it would go
through a very nasty time of economic
shocks. They favor this risk because
they believe the shocks would do
Britain good. The critics of Mr. Jay’s
scheme fix particularly on this sugges-
tion of balance-of-payments advantages
to Britain which, with some reason, they
find unconvincing. But nevertheless,
even some of his critics say that, as a
purely economic case, his scheme makes
sense.
Their most impressing argument
against it is that—for political reasons
—it can’t happen. Partly because the
United States, Canada, Australia, and
New Zealand all have strong protec-
tionist policies that they would never
abandon. Partly because the U.S.
would not want to split “the Western
world” into two economic blocs.
But this argument must be put in its
general setting. For one thing, it is not
yet all that certain that Britain will be
accepted into the Common Market even
when de Gaulle goes. For another, the
fact that the United States is now pro-
tectionist does not mean that it will re-
main for ever so. Mr. Jay says: “The
successive rounds of multilateral tariff
cuts under GATT have shown what can
be done, as has the success of regional
free-trade areas and Customs Unions
like EFTA and the EEC, and bilateral
free-trade areas like the Anglo-Irish and
the Australia-New Zealand.” And so far
as the division of “the West” into two
trading blocs is concerned, one point
is that EEC obduracy may leave no
alternative, especially since the EEC is
run partly as a farmers’ protectionist
racket.
There is no chance of being confident
about what is or is not going to be
politically possible in the future. A
different approach is to ask whether
NAFTA is itself a desirable idea, and if
it is, to consider whether it is worth
trying to make it possible.
Here the division of opinion in
Britain is not really on economic
grounds in purely economic terms
NAFTA looks a better bet than the
EEC but on broad questions of
national self-importance and identity.
To many of the elite groups of
Britain, the driving appeal of British
entry into the EEC is its potential
political importance. Bored with the
Commonwealth, frustrated by their in-
ferior status in relation to America,
they saw in “entry into Europe” an
opportunity for increasing British self-

importance. Privately many of them
make it quite clear that they see Europe
after de Gaulle as an arena in which
they can become the star turn. They
want to give the EEC a political pur-
pose and to “lead Europe” in a way that
exceeds even the ambitions of de Gaulle.
There is something sadly illusory in
this ambition. Europe is not likely to be
“led” by anyone, and certainly not by a
Britain whose economy would suffer
such shocks from a reversal of economic
habits that for some years it might re-
main the problem partner of the EEC.
It is also indicative of the estrange-
ment of the British elites from the
ordinary people of Britain. There is
little doubt that the ordinary British
would prefer a higher living standard to
a bid for national self-importance
(especially since it would fail and pos-
sibly be accompanied at least for a
while by a slowing down of living
standards). There would also seem little
doubt that the ordinary people of
Britain would feel more at home with
Americans, Canadians, and Australians
than they would with West Europeans.
But to many of the elites of Britain
envy of American influences now over-
rides all other considerations.
Mr. Jay should have the last word.
He says: “Politically and economically
EFTA would have a tremendous appeal
to the democratic and English-speaking
world, and it would therefore give
Britain a true initiative and the political
role she is seeking in the latter half
of the 20th century. Being based
essentially on a nucleus of nations
genuinely and deeply attached to Par-
liamentary Government, as proved by
hard experience over generations, it
would be firmly and visibly in the
British tradition. By being based also
on liberal trading principles, freer
access for the trade of poorer countries,
and the principles of social justice and
tolerance in internal politics, such a
group would have a genuine coherence
which does not at present exist through-
out Western Europe.
“By following this long-term aim, by
sticking to our proved friends and true
intellectual traditions, and by building
our economic strength, we have it in
our power to achieve a future which,
though less commanding, will be no
less distinguished than the past. All
this could be thrown away if we irre-
vocably weaken ourselves economically,
or lose our political convictions, in the
perverse belief that something exists
called ‘Europe’ which in fact has little
political, intellectual, economic, or
other meaning than that of geographical
accident. If we make the right choice,
we shall in fact enjoy a far better
chance of achieving lasting and
friendly partnership with the vigorous
but diverse nations which do really
exist in Europe—from the Urals to the
Atlantic and of sharing with them
what each of us has to offer, than if we
are ourselves artificially weakened and
indissolubly tied to one arbitrarily
selected group among them. We shall
also be burning fewer boats and keep-
ing more options open.”


BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
The cost of self-sufficiency
IT IS, OF COURSE, not surprising
that many average members of the
Australian electorate, on learning that
their country was floating on a sea of
oil though a modest one assumed
that, when all the fortunes had been
made on the stock exchanges and the
oil was at last flowing through, they
would benefit from this great discovery
through cheaper petrol. It is economi-
cally naive of them to do so.
It could, perhaps, be explained to
them that independence is a valuable
commodity, one which has always born
a high cost, and that the rise in the
price of petrol was part of that cost.
They could be told that they are, in
fact, paying for the nation’s pride and
security in being self-sufficient in oil.
But as the cost permeates across the
face of the continent through the
arteries of an increasingly costly
national transport system and an in-
creasingly expensive output from in-
dustry, they might begin to wonder
whether it is all worth it.
They should start wondering now.
Tor when the Government comes to re-
vise its present cash incentive payments
on indigenous crude, the price of their
petrol will go up. It is just a question
of by how much.
At present, as a result of the present
level of protection, local crude used by
Australian refineries costs them about
40 percent more than imported, but as
present Australian output amounts to
only about 10 percent of their refinery
inputs, and as some of the refining
companies (Caltex, Shell, and Ampol)
get the local crude they use at cost price
from WAPET, in which they share the
equity, so far the effect of local pro-
duction of the high level of protection
for local crude has been minimal.
It will not remain so. Esso-BHP,
having now co'mmitted Bass Strait to
a modest 1200 barrels,' give rise to
estimates that indigenous crude oil will
be supplying 60 percent of the country’s
needs by 1970. The Federal Govern-
ment has announced that it will revise
its pricing policy at that time to pre-
vent the price of petrol rocketing into
absurdity. But Mr. Fairbairn, the Mini-
ster of National Development, has also
made it clear that the Government is
unlikely to abandon the present system
of incentive payments altogether in
favor of some sort of tax or subsidy in-
centive. Meaning, in rougher terms,
that the extra cost of producing crude
oil in Australia instead of importing it
must be born by the consumer which
is as it should be, assu'ming that the
cost buiden of independence has been
ac i 3y . a . S while.
Self-sufficiency in oil is not even
lemotely in view as yet. And to i educe
the incentive payments without putting
anything in then place is to compromise
t e possi 3uity that it ever will become
so. At the rate known reserves will be
drawn on in 1970 they will last for
probably no longer than 15 years. An
, ; .i . . c
enormous boost in the present rate of
exploration will be required before even
a rough approach toward self-
sufficiency can be hoped for. And it was
adequately demonstrated by the liberal
taxation policies and subsidised drilling
introduced in 1956 that periodic Gov-
ernment incentives can go a very long
way toward providing that boost. Obvi-
ously, the price of petrol cannot be
allowed to soar in 1970. But just how
far can the present pricing system be
cut and still leave an adequate in-
centive margin? The Government is
quite clearly going to come under
some strong pressures from the two
opposing sides of vested interests.
Esso-BHP, the small independent pro-
ducers, the exploration companies, and
those of the oil refiners with stakes in
local production (who will be in a
superior competitive position vis. a vis
those who have not) are pushing for
the high price of crude oil to be main-
tained while the major “have-not”
marketing companies protest that the
present price incentive scale maintained
in the conditions of 1970 would put
them out of business quite apafrt
from the high price of petrol being an
extremely unpopular political state of
affairs from the Govern'ment’s point
of view. It is perfectly clear to the
electorate, the Government, and the
“have-nots” that Esso-BHP stand to
make substantial profits without the
help of a big incentive price bonus.
The Government seems a little per-
plexed. It is calling out for more views
and more information; it has employed
a Dr. Frankel of London’s Petroleum
Economics Ltd. to advise it on policies
of pricing and utilisation; it is unsure
whether to ask the Tariff Board to
hold a new hearing on a price structure
(Mr. McEwen trebled the last TB
recommendation on this subject back
in 1965) or whether to fix it in some
other way.
But in the babble of many voices
that is bound to surround this 'matter
over the next year or so, it should not
be forgotten that it is an adequate
incentive to boost the rate of oil explor-
ation that is being looked for. And if
in its knowledge and understanding the
Government can find no incentive other
than that of an inflated price structure,
then it must strike an uneasy compro-
mise between prospects of self-
sufficiency in oil, the state of the econ-
omy and the temper of the electorate
in general, and face the consequences.
Trans-Pacific flights
Cheap fares up in the air
ONCE our man in Washington and
now Eastern Airlines’ man in Austra-
lia, Sir Howard Beale was a politician
a lot longer than he has been an air-
line executive, so perhaps it was natural
that when he flew into Sydney last
Our man in Eastern Airlines
week he was prepared to talk to airport
Pressmen about the scramble for the
Presidency and U.S. racial problems.
But instead he was questioned doggedly
about the entry of Eastern, America’s
second-largest operator, into the Pacific
route next year and what its under-
taking to cut fares by 25 percent would
mean for Qantas. As things turned out,
it might have been better if Sir Howard
had been able to stick to politics where
.credibility gaps are too usual to be
embarrassing.
It was the figure of $4OO as the New
York-Sydney fare reduction by mid-
-1969 that caused the ensuing flurry in
which Aviation Minister Swartz pledged
protection for Qantas’ interests and said
no one airline could reduce fares uni-
laterally, since they were fixed by the
International Air Transport Association


and must be agreed to by all Govern-
ments concerned.
Later, in Eastern’s 32nd-floor suite
in the Australia Tower, Sir Howard
agreed that this was quite true. The
$4OO figure had never been his, anyway,
he said. The Pressmen had done their
own arithmetic, reducing the present
$l6OO fare by 25 percent and crediting
the sum to him.
Not that he lacked faith in Eastern’s
ability to make the 25 percent reduc-
tion on which it based its application
to the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board,
thereby beating 17 other eager Ameri-
can operators to new booty in the
Pacific.
It is theoretically possible that
cheaper U.S.-Australia fares could
operate by mid-1969, since a new price
agreement, still to be negotiated, will
operate from April 1 next. But a lot
of airline-to-airline, Government-to-
Government bargaining and counter-
bargaining wifi go on before then.
Protectionism
The devil's due
THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES
Development Association is a past
master at dressing-up the wolf of pro-
tection in sheep’s clothing, and Sir
William Gunn might well take a few
lessons from it on that score.
It feels that if private enterprise is
to play a positive and responsible role
in industrial development, more atten-
tion should be given to it by the Tariff
Board, which now only occasionally
recommends protection for a product
not yet produced here, and to which
the protection will only apply if pro-
duction starts. AIDA’s point seems to
be that by letting it be known in
advance that a firm will get protection
for making a product, the more likely
are investors to subscribe the necessary
capital for its making.
Heaven forbid that we throw any
more hostages to the growth of pro-
tection, but, as we’re stuck with it. it is
only common sense to apply it as use-
fully as possible, especially in the case
of encouraging new industries. Nor is
there anything new in protection beat-
ing the production gun. It happens, as
AIDA says, in the form of cost con-
cessions offered as inducements by
State Governments to intending manu-
facturers here, while in other countries
products are often grouped into broad
bands of duty levels so that develop-
ment can proceed in an orderly fashion
within a pre-determined framework and
in the most economic directions.
Not all the early birds catch tariff
worms, of course. Nor should, in the
opinion of the Metal Trades Employers’
Association, a lot of firms which have
built imposing manufacturing edifices
on high-tariff stilts assume that the
protection they presently enjoy will
always be available, or that future
MEN AND MATTERS
UNLIKE THAT OTHER unhappily
unlisted public company, BP of Aus-
tralia, which also put in a good profit
result last week, Alcoa of Australia
has now been manufacturing long
enough in a province in Victoria to give
real meaning to the pursuit of decen-
tralisation in the State. Alcoa has added
a new dimension to the economic life
of Geelong, as indeed to the geographic
orbit of that city, whereas BP’s refinery,
though solid groundwork for a new
industrial complex at Westernport,
hasn’t been long enough established to
have done a similar job for the hamlet
of Hastings.
Seven years ago, when Alcoa arrived
at Point Henry on the bare Bellarine
Peninsula, the place was a peaceful
habitat of gulls and flies and a lonely
farmhouse. Today, the farmhouse and
the flies have gone and it is a hive of
humans and industrial endeavor across
to which the residents of the older
part of Geelong look with growing
commercial expectation. We were told
by the managing director, Mr. A. C.
Sheldon, at the release of the accounts
last week, that Alcoa’s operations at
Geelong now employ about 1200 and
when the pots for the new smelter are
hotted up in about eighteen months’
time there will be up to 500 more.
Apart from these and, in the interim,
a host of construction workers spending
in the city, there is the increasing busi-
ness Alcoa itself does with other com-
mercial and industrial establishments
and local civic authorities. All this
greatly enhances Geelong’s claim to be
one of the most up-and-coming pro-
vincial centres in the country.
One of the liveliest supporters of this
claim in Geelong is G. S. Mawdsley,
the chairman of the new branch of the
Victoria Chamber of Manufactures,
opened in the citv last week to the
accompaniment of hosannahs from
most of the leading lights of the central
Chamber in Melbourne, which, on Gee-
long’s behalf, is building and financing
a similar sort of services setup at
Western Beach to its own in St. Kilda
Road. The new building will naturally
look straight across to Point Henry.
Mr. Mawdsley, who has long been a
vice-president of the Victorian Cham-
ber, is general manager of Donaghys, a
local rope manufacturer, one of the 103
industrial establishments in the city. A
third-generation Australian, Mawdsley
was born in Williamstown where his
father was at the Newport railway work-
shops, and went to Donaghys in 1926
as an accountant, later becoming secre-
tary and then general manager. The
secretary of the new Chamber, which
will run in parallel to the Victorian one
and not as an integral part of it, will be
Phil Gude, who comes across from
Frods to take up the position. His
family roots in Geelong go back a
hundred years or more.
SIXTY-TWO sounds like a fair age to
start up in a new line of business. But
that is what Mr. Paul Haege, the com-
pany director whose frequent letters to
the editor claim more newspaper space
a year than his companies’ reports, is-
now doing.
Last week he resigned all Executive
positions, including that of financial
consultant, with the Dalton Brothers’
Holdings group “to pursue his other
commercial interests.” This will be a
new investment analysis and counselling
business for both private and institu-
tional clients, Haege and Haege, where
he may be joined in time by one or
more of his four sons. He will, how-
ever, remain on the board of the parent
company to give it the benefit of his-
-40 years’ business experience.
This self-confessed “intriguing per-
sonality” was born in Chatswood in
1906, a fourth generation (intensely)
Australian, but was educated at Mel-
bourne Grammar and went on to
Trinity College, Melbourne University,,
to do Arts with honors. Technological
studies at Manchester prepared him for
the paper-making and printing business,
Hermann Haege Ltd., which his great-
uncle (of a Gothic family, from Malmo
in the south of Sweden) started in 1848.
He eventually became chairman of
Hermann Haege, which Dalton Brothers
bought out in 1960, following this up
with acquisition of Paperholdings, in
which Hermann Haege and Mr. Haege
himself were big shareholders. Paul
Haege was taken over along with the
business.
Prior to this Mr. Haege had started
Comtex, which became the biggest rag
textile merchant, but the business was
destroyed by fire, much to Mr. Haege’s-
relief.
An erstwhile Fellow of the Royal
Economy Society, Mr. Haege is an in-
veterate letterwriter to newspapers,
where he defends de Gaulle’s economic
policies for a gold basis for currencies,
and has predicted accurately the last
two devaluations of sterling. (He was-
foretelling the last one three weeks
before, and now states there will be
another devaluation within 12 months.)
The late Staniforth Ricketson congratu-
lated him on his prescience, but not de
Gaulle.
He believes in the conservation of
gold in Australia, rather than exchang-
ing for sterling paper money, which is
getting less and less valuable.
Energetically informal (“Call me
Paul”), he has a passion for tennis,
enjoys watching Soccer, birds, and read-
ing French novels in the original.
Before dashing off to New Zealand
by sea for a few days, with the intention
of encouraging trade between the two
countries (believing a South Pacific
trading area is essential), Paul told The
Bulletin about a book he is writing on
the political economy of Australia. It
sounds as if it will have a lot of advice
in it on how this country should be
run.

requests will escape scrutiny in a broad
national context and on stringent
economic criteria. In the new search
for economic protection nobody should
be complacent, especially manufacturers
reluctant to come before the Tariff
Board to state their cases to justify
retention of long-established protection.
Equally, the arbitration cannot assume
so blithely that rising employment costs
will be obligingly cushioned by a com-
pliant Tariff Board, as the Metal
Trades Employers’ Association puts it.
U.S. trade mission
Buying love
THE INVASION of about fifty busi-
ness men from the U.S. hit Victoria last
Friday. The dialogue The Bulletin
succeeded in having with them was
highly revealing of the over-spill of
products and capital piling up for
export in the U.S., particularly con-
sidering the current restrictions on
American investment here and what
one discerns from some of them that
the American abroad feels unloved these
days.
Compared with some of the U.S.
bankers who’ve rather overstepped the
mark in projecting their future
intrusion into our commercial affairs,
our present visitors strike one as being
much more folksy-minded. Obviously,
there’s still a big head of export capital
steam in private U.S. pipes awaiting
release in our direction when Washing-
ton decides to give the signal which
presumably will only be given when
the country’s balance of payments
easement takes pressure off the U.S.
dollar. This isn’t going to happen
tomorrow, of course, but the presence
of all these U.S. businessmen looking
for trade and investment opportunities
in Australia at this particular time is a
hopeful augury for it.
The Department of Commerce in
the U.S. can hardly be all that out of
touch with the Department of State.
The puzzle is not so much in the capital
export aspect, or so it would seem, as
on the trade side, because it would take
only a mild gesture from the Depart-
ment of Commerce to reduce the U.S.
duty on wool and to lighten the res-
trictions on metal and dairy produce
imports from Australia (coupled per-
haps with action here to scale down
and ultimately abolish imperial prefer-
ences), and so open up wide new
avenues of trade between our two
countries. The impression remains after
many years of hard experience that
somehow or other the U.S. speaks with
two voices in its trade relations with
Australia, and that the strongest of these
voices is not the Government at all but
the Washington lobbyists of the
domestic interests who would suffer
from the liberalisation of the imports
of the products they are so anxious
to protect.

The Croesus Touch
BY J. C. HORSFALL
VIEWING THE ECONOMY
IN A
CRYSTAL BALL
TO GET A CREDIBLE picture of
the shape and tempo of the Australian
economy in a year’s time you have to
make a lot of assumptions and be put
to severe tests to justify them. Such
assumptions would include estimations
of how the monetary and fiscal auth-
orities are going to behave, what the
Arbitration Commission is going to do
on award wages, what effect price
trends are going to have on the pro-
pensity to save, what the net effects of
overseas economic and political events
on the balance of payments will be, and
so on. You name it, there are a hun-
dred and one things that could upset
your forecast. And that is why the
Institute of Applied Economics must
be congratulated for sticking its neck
out so far in the first issue of its new
quarterly, “The Australian Economic
Review,” even if the tongue of the
editor, Dr. D. S. O. Ironmonger, is
firmly in his cheek on some of the
pointers.
The first question to ask about the
assumptions Ironmonger uses is whether
in fact it is right to rule out the pos-
sibility of the balance of payments hav-
ing an inhibiting effect on internal
activity and policies in the years ahead.
What the “Review” says (in summary)
is that “Australian international re-
serves may run down from £l2OO mil-
lion in June, 1967, to about £9OO
million by June, 1969, but prospects for
mineral exports and replacement of oil
imports in the 1970 s are so good that
this dip in reserves can be accepted
without any action to restraining acti-
vity in Australia.” There’s confidence
if you like; it rolls up into a neat and
manageable dip in reserves all the
umpteen imponderables surrounding
the balance of payments like
capital inflow, export prices, importing
waves, and overseas payments for de-
fence. Then it draws the handy corol-
lary that we need only put our head
down and go. This may seem a bit too
much like forecasting in a vacuum to
satisfy everybody. Perhaps the next
issue of the “Review” will put a more
searching eye over the balance of pay-
ments, give it much more detailed
treatment, and not put it in at the
end as almost an afterthought.
In most aspects the “Review” handles
the compensating effect of more spirited
internal income generators on laggard
ones (mentioned here last week) with
consummate skill. Its treatment of the
various sources of demand is fresh
and revealing. But it seems to slip
back into an academic pipe dream when
talking about Government spending
< possibilities over the next year. Its
mood is all the more surprising after
earlier recognising that the increase
in Federal Government expenditure
this year has been far greater than the
Treasurer forecast when offering a
bigger slice of the cake to the private
sector last August. Maybe, as it
assumes, the Treasurer will impose
additional restraints in the coming
Budget (it prefers personal taxes to
business ones for that purpose) to
moderate the rate of increase in public-
sector demand from this year’s 12 per-
cent to 11 percent. But is it realistic to
expect that the increase of 10.2 per-
cent in public capital expenditure this
year can be reduced to 6.7 percent next
year? There seems to be a high degree
of wishful thinking in such an expecta-
tion. Thinking, one would say, which
will not be shared by a single State
Government.
However strongly all the other in-
come generators examined by the “Re-
view” may have thrown up inflationary
signals when put together into its com-
puter, it would still have been more
realistic to have thrown in Government
spending, not at the figure it should
rightly be but at the figure it is
likely to be. If the latter had been done,
the “Review” would perhaps have staked
a more convincing claim to be heard
in policy-making parlors. That apart,
the sort of exercise now attempted by
the “Review” has long been done on a
continuing basis in the Federal
Treasury, though not made available
from quarter to quarter as this one
will be for the business world’s in-
spection and lasting enlightenment.
One of the more important assump-
tions relating to the build up of demand
pressures next year is that the “Review”
expects the Arbitration Commission to
put another $1.70 a week on the total
wage as a result of the economic case
set down for August this year. Largely
as a result of this and the accumulated
effects of the other wage increases, the
“Review” expects personal disposable
income to rise by 8.7 percent next year.
This imputed increase appears to be the
main reason for the “Review’s” strong
advocacy of a tight budget. Its object
would be to restrain public and house-
hold spending with the taxation
emphasis strictly on the containment
of personal consumption and consumer
price rise.
The “Review” says that there’s a strong
impetus clement in fixed capital expen-
diture and it expects it to be pushed
up by $55 million a quarter next year
compared with the $5O million it
expected for this year. Even so, and
allowing for some predicted stock build-
ing thrown on, a rise of this small
magnitude would by itself hardly hold
serious inflationary implications. But
the “Review’s” general point is certainly
valid, that together with the expected
rise in disposable income “pressures
on capacity throughout the economy
should be significantly stronger next
year.”

BRIEFLY
The economy: Capital inflow trebled in the March
quarter to $382 million, largely in portfolio investment
and institutional loans.
There was a deterioration in the balance of trade, as
exports for the March quarter fell $42 million, while
imports rose $l2O 'million.
Minister for National Development, Mr. D. E. Fairbairn,
indicated (hard on the heels of the BHP-Esso announce-
ment) a cut in the price of Australian-produced oil would
be considered.
Brisbane’s ninth series of wool sales opened on a buoyant
note.
And the rains came . . . rain on the tablelands, western
slopes, and plains of N.S.W., raising the hopes of wheat
farmers and pastoralists . . . good relief rains throughout
most of western and northern Queensland . . . heavy
falls in southern S.A. . . . widespread rains in the Northern
Territory . . . even drought-breaking rains for farmers
in Victoria.
Australian producers’ copper price was reduced to $llOO
a ton, two weeks after a fall from peak of $1350 to $l2OO.
The markets: It was an eventful week on Australian
share markets, with most glamor attaching to Western
Mining, which made a special announcement shortly
before its regular three-monthly report is due, reporting
values up to 11.07 percent, and that there appear to
be four separate ore positions at Kambalda West. There
is the growing feeling that this could be the world’s richest
nickel 'mine. Local markets took the fully paids to $14.50,
putting a $lOOO million plus value on the organisation.
Officially reporting to the Victorian Government) BHP
estimated recoverable oil reserves of the Halibut and
Kingfish fields in Bass Strait at 1200 million barrels,
and the shares moved above $25.
Swamped by low-value transfers, the two major Australian
exchanges, Sydney and Melbourne, decided to increase
minimum marketable parcels that could be traded without
attracting special odd-lot brokerage. Marketable parcel of
shares under 25c will be 1000 from June 3.
Australian mining shares stopped for a breather after a
week of hectic advances on the London stock market,
with several leading issues falling back slightly from their
recent high levels as sellers moved in to take profits. The
undertone remained very firm, however.
After a week of brisk trading on Wall Street, the market
closed by chalking up its eighth consecutive advance.
Companies: In its first interim report in history, Bums
Philp did not give away much. It earned somewhat
better profits for the December half, and sales were
maintained in all sections.
Drought and intense competition in the first half to
February put an end to J. B. Young’s seven-year run of
profit increases. The drought and unseasonally warm
weather are no good for the chocolate makers, either.
Sales of Cadbury Fry Pascall group (incorporating Mac.-
Robertson) were down in the March quarter of 1968.
In the December half, Olympic lifted profit from $1.85
million to $2.08 'million and made an additional capital
profit of $436,000.
Tyree will dominate the local transformer industry-
following takeover of GEC-AEl’s Australian manufacturing
interests at a cost of $3 million, to be financed partly by
a one-for-four issue of 50c shares at $1.50. Frank Brown
has increased his partial offer for 51 percent of the
shares in Shipping Newspapers (whose directors deny an
offer has been received) from 75 to 95c a share. Following
recommendations from the respective boards of directors,
Hunter Douglas is to make a takeover offer worth more
than $3.6 million for Dural Leeds Holdings of Victoria.
On current prices, the offer was worth about $2.14 per
Dural Leeds share.
DFC profit fell considerably in the December half.
Parbury Henty will make a one-for-five par issue to raise
$296,000, and expects to maintain dividend at 11 percent.
An AMP subsidiary, Stanbroke Pastoral Co. Pty. Ltd.,
extended its activities into the Northern Territory with the

From start to finish, A-Z Zinc is 100% Australian.
It is produced in Australia under the watchful eye
of the chemists and metallurgists of an all-
Australian company, Electrolytic Zinc Company of
Australasia Limited. It is used by hundreds of
Australian companies. So much so that every year
Australia uses more zinc per head of population
than any other country. About twice as much, in
fact. And it’s earning Australia around $25,000,000
in export income every year. In countries like the
U.S.A., United Kingdom, Germany, India and
twenty-six others. All in all, a valuable
contribution to Australia’s continuing prosperity.
A-Z High Grade Electrolytic Zinc (99.95 + %) for galvanising,
brass, zinc oxide, rolled zinc.
A-Z Special High Grade Electrolytic Zinc (99.99 +%) for die
casting alloys.

Mt. Isa breaks
through to
a bright future
IT’S NOT CALLED filthy lucre for
nothing. A doctor friend of mine was
telling me the other day that as well
as being the root of all evil money
was also a serious health hazard.
Apparently the number of germs that
can bum a free ride on a dollar bill or
a twenty-cent piece is quite fantastic.
And just the mere act of scratching
your chin or wiping your eye after
handling the filthy stuff is enough to
allow the germs to transfer their atten-
tions to you. Hepatitis and staph are
but two of the nasty diseases involved.
Mt. Isa has been in strife. It’s had
just one thing after another happen to
it. It’s had trouble with “Big” Pat
Mackie (five months of it, to be pre-
cise), it’s had trouble getting its new
underground crusher installed and
working, and it’s had trouble with low-
grade ores. Now, at last, it seems as if
it’s going to make the breakthrough.
It’s long-term expansion program, which
it has had in the boiling pot for some-
where around ten years, now looks as
though it’s ready to pay dividends (and
I use this word in its every sense).
Barring a major catastrophe, and the
company has probably had more than
its fair share of these for some time,
Mt. Isa should be able to look forward
to several years of very rapidly increas-
ing profits. To appreciate just how
rapid these increases could be, consider
the mine’s present and future through-
put figures. Earlier this year and prob-
ably 'most of last year the company’s
extraction rate was averaging 10,000
tons per day. By next year, when it
is expected that the present technical
mining difficulties will be fully over-
come and the situation is improving
daily production will be in the
vicinity of 16,000 tons. And looking
even further than that, in the early
1970 s output is expected to reach
22,000 tons per day.
In the really short term the company
also looks a worthwhile bet. Although
the chairman initially forecast that
1968’s profit would not be as good as
1967’5, it now looks as though this
won’t necessarily be the case at all. In
fact, it now looks as though there’s a
good chance that the current year’s
profit will be at least equal or perhaps
lae even slightly better than last year’s.
The reason is due to the rather faster-
than-expected improvement in produc-
tion over the: past few months and to
the generally better copper prices. Pro-
duction of blister copper, which was
down 28 percent in the first half of
the year, has picked up considerably.
In the 40 weeks to April 7 it was only
lagging 18 percent and was making up
leeway daily. As well as this the other
metals that the company produces are
also doing very well. In the same 40
weeks lead ore treated was up from
690,142 tons to 892,670 tons; lead
bullion was up from 43,430 tons to
62,620 tons, and zinc concentrates had
moved along from 50,124 tons to 68,172
tons. Incidentally, if you’re worried
about the metal in Mt. Isa running out,
you have no worries. At the last balance
date ore s reserves were estimated at
42 million tons for copper, and silver/
lead/zinc at 32 million tons.
Being more than usually impressed
with this company’s immediate,
medium, and long-term future I bought
200. Luckily, although the stock’s price
has moved up by $2.80 already this
year, it has not been affected (com-
paratively speaking) to too great a
degree by the present boom. Its current
price of $6.90 is not much more than
double what it was back in the old
black days of 1965.
On the subject of Mt. Isa, I see that
their chairman, Sir George Fisher, has
made quick work of all those theories
about Australia selling off its birthright
and having embarrassingly large chunks
of its mining dividends floating off over-
seas. He has quite plainly stated that
these ideas are nothing more than
myths. He reckons, in fact, that owner-
ship of most of the country’s main mines
is much more firmly under the thumb
of Australians now than ever. Two of
the examples he gave were Western
Mining, once an overseas-owned com-
pany, now 90 percent locally owned,
and North Broken Hill, which in 1913
was 66 percent overseas owned and
which now has only 16 percent of its
capital vested outside the country.
The only stock I decided to sell this
week was Exoil. With a 50 percent
rise in just on two weeks it was just
too good to take a chance on. The brief
but enjoyable association yielded me
$244.

MIMING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THE GUTS of the boom are the 15
mining stocks listed below. Of course,
there are others, like most of the gold-
miners and some of the 20-cent oil
stocks that have also notched up rises
almost as good as Oil Search’s. Now
the big question is whether these will
continue to be the boomers if the
boom continues. Or will there be
others taking their place? Or will the
centre of attraction switch out of min-
ing into the industrial sector, which has
almost completely missed out on the
boom, except for the ten stocks also
listed below?
But most of the ten best industrials
depend on their mineral interests any-
way for their status. No matter how
good the prospects for industrials (and
the weekend’s buoyant Treasury White
Paper on the economy indicates that
many industrials may be underpriced
in relation to the rate of progress of
the economy), there is no point jump-
ing into this market unless it has suf-
ficient popular appeal to carry it along.
The simple fact is that it hasn’t; and
it won’t have until more people decide
to take their profits out of mining and
stick them into industrials. At present,
the trend is the other way around, as
many investors, particularly from over-
seas, are selling out their steady stocks
like Woolworths to put the cash into
the booming mining market.
Most of the wise money seems to be
sticking with the leaders of the boom;
the top 15 are making up by far the
bulk of the record turnovers now giving
brokers such contented looks. And the
pattern continues of British demand for
shares in these top companies being
met by Australian sellers; every day on
Australian stock markets starts off with
high prices as a result of British over-
night demand, which are then knocked
down by Australians cashing in their
shares as the day progresses.
How long will this supply of ready
sellers last? The demand seems in-
exhaustible and may only be be-
ginning if the increasing newspaper in-
terest in Britain and Europe about the
Australian market is any guide.
And as long as so much boom-gener-
ated cash is being spent on further ex-
ploration and development in Aus-
tralia (we’ve never spent so much in
our history) the prospects of even
greater bonanzas are very great indeed,
so that the boom quite sensibly does
feed on itself. The best advice for a
boom like this is to stick with the
strength in 'mining shares and to play
the ups and downs in the oil market
as the wells go dowm.
THE LATEST set of forecasts about
BHP has come from Melbourne broker
F. R. Morgan (the man who “dis-
covered” what nickel really meant to
Western Mining Corporation a year
ago). He estimates on a conservative
basis the present value of BHP at
around $25, which is pretty close to its
current price. But he says (in a study
that he is at present placing before
British clients; he is one of the battalion
of Australian brokers at present over-
seas drumming up business) that, tak-
ing a more confident view, it could be
worth about $3O at present. In any
event, he forecasts conservatively that
the value of the shares will continue to
advance to about $29 by 1973 and to
$35.60 on a more confident and less
conservative basis. Morgan deserves to
be taken seriously about BHP; last
year when the price was $lO he said it
should have been $2O.
But his BHP study was not the only
one he issued at the weekend. As was
forecast in last week’s Bulletin, he put
out what, in other circumstances, would
have been a depressing survey on WMC.
Ignoring last week’s massive additions
to WMC’s ore reserves, the survey sug-
gested the shares were overvalued at
prices over $ll. And since he empha-
sises the technical task ahead of the
company in exploiting its reserve, he is
clearly more concerned with produc-
tion prospects than reserves of ore.
He thinks it difficult to find sup-
port, on fundamental grounds, for the
high prices (over the $5O mark) of
earlier this year that were last week
exceeded on the new post-split basis.
He regards a range between $6 to $8
as reasonable for this stock (using an
8 percent discount rate on anticipated
future earnings) but says that higher
values up to $lO to $ll could be war-
ranted by using less severe discount
rates. But he warns that “it would be
unrealistic to expect market growth to
continue indefinitely on the same jet-
propelled path of last year,” although
“WMC has been confirmed as one of
the handful of major Australian-based
mineral growth stocks.”
By the way, our Chartist reports on
WMC, which was recommended here
recently: “The short-term target of
$ll.OO has been quickly achieved and
there is the possibility of a further
upward move to $15.00. It is now a
case for daily trending as the major
broad uptrend is still well intact. Last
sale price, 2/5/68, $12.20.”
Yet another special study by F. R.


Morgan released at the weekend was
on three recommended coal companies,
Coal and Allied Industries, Bellambi
Coal, and Thiess Holdings. For Coal
Allied he expects earnings to rise from
16.4 cents a share to 25 cents by the
early 1970 s and for the dividend rate
to increase; for Bellambi (one of the
Consolidated Goldfield stable) he fore-
casts earnings could rise from 6.4 cents
to 39 cents a share by 1970, provided
its serious cost and production problems
are solved, and for Thiess Holdings he
thinks that earnings will rise to pos-
sibly 40 cents by the early 19705, of
which 18.5 cents should come from the
Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui coal mine at
Moura.
The Melbourne Market
Local listing
for Alcoa?
IT IS ONE THING to become, as
Alcoa did last week, a public company
and quite another to become a listed
one to give minority shareholders a
market for their stake. In Alcoa’s case
Sir Lindesay Clark told us quite firmly
that its change from proprietary to
limited company status held no implica-
tions that the further step of offering
some of the shares to the Australian
public was in the company’s mind. All
it was doing was to put itself in a better
position toward the capital-raising
facilities of the market, and in this
connection he was thinking, so it
seemed, of short-term or bridging
finance rather than long-term stuff; the
facility of being able to use, say, a
broker rather than an underwriter of
a fixed-interest issue; the facility of
getting temporary funds from the inter-
company market and putting idle cash
in the short-term money market where,
apparently, it has met obstacles, accord-
ing to him though why this should
be so remained rather a mystery even
after quizzing him.
Doubtless, if Alcoa urgently wanted
some Australian funds of a permanent
nature, or was even stuck for tem-
porary finance, Sir Lindesay would not
be at a loss even if its bankers were
unwilling. A whip round the boards of
the three Australian partners, his own
Western Mining and the two Collins
House building mates, Broken Hill
Souths and Norths, would produce a
“bob” or two, not that it would ever
be likely to come to that, even given
his suggestion that despite his assertion
that funds in sight were still marginally
insufficient to meet all the capital
commitments the group has indulged in
for its quadrupling of Kwinana by late
next year and its doubling of Point
Henry’s smelting capacity within the
next two years. Alcoa is certainly not
in any financial discomfort, what with
the $46 million Euro-dollar loan in
hand, its own cash flow moving up
nicely, and new channels being opened
up by its step into limited company
status.
The one thorn in Alcoa’s side is not
pricking from that direction at all but
rather from the direction of the
ordinary shareholders in the three com-
panies who hold the minority interest
and who coughed up their money to
help finance the venture on the basis
that by the end of 1964 dividends
would be paid. Now, maybe, Sir Linde-
say has satisfied his conscience on the
score of three years having passed with-
out this dividend undertaking being met
by having a few chats with the boards
of the three companies (talking to him-
self, in one case) and finding them
happy enough to postpone fulfilment of
their expectations. For individual share-
holders in these three companies the
situation must seem anomalous, even
in the case of Western Mining, where,
for instance, any inconvenience of being
locked into Alcoa has been greatly
mitigated by the fantastic capital bene-
fits that have accrued as a result of
the successful excursion in nickel for
which another substantial contribution
was thrown at them last week, with the
announcement of the further remark-
able results of new drilling.
True enough, nobody needs to stay
in either of these companies unless they
want to, and, certainly, there have been
better opportunities in the mining
market for these companies to switch
into in the past three years of the
dividendless state in Alcoa had they
felt they’d been badly treated by the
Alcoa board but just -suppose there
had been no mining boom to offer
profitable lines of retreat. The odd thing
from the purist angle is that, although
Alcoa has not until this year made a
profit and still has $lO million or so
accumulated deficit in its profit and
loss account, it can hardly fail to pay
off handsomely as an investment in the
long run, even if that long run may be
a much longer one than seemed likely
when the prospectuses for WMC,
Norths, and Souths were filed seven
years ago.
Without being too pure about all this
it can be seen that, at least on a point
of principle, such a situation should be
contested by shareholders in the three
companies however complacent about
it the boards of these companies might
be. Looking for remedies, the best way
round it, from all viewpoints, would
be for Alcoa to unlock them by listing
its shares. When put to an official of
the company one got the answer that
it would be difficult to get any of the
four partner companies in the venture
to offer some of their shares to the
public. Talking strictly of the inter-
locking directorate this might be so.
But if put to a vote, say of Broken Hill
South and North Broken Hill, share-
holders who put up the money for their
share interest in Alcoa, the answer
would probably be quite different.
There are other angles to the reluc-
tance of Alcoa to market its shares,
which do not even touch the reluctance
of American companies to list the
shares of their subsidiaries in foreign
countries. (As a matter of fact, Alcoa
of America would have been satisfied
with 49 percent of the Australian sub-
sidiary were it not for the fact that
the three Australian companies con-
cerned in the venture were so keen to
have Alcoa in the name.) One such
angle is that by an enlightened public-
relations campaign, Alcoa of Australia
appears to have got all and more of
the publicity it needed while still
remaining a proprietary company. Its
main rival, Comalco, by one remove a
publicly listed company, has fared even
better, of course, in this direction,
despite the fact that a good deal more
of it is owned by foreigners than is
the case with Alcoa. Doubtless the pros
and cons of floating have been
thoroughly aired by Alcoa’s board, but
now it could gain a great psychological
advantage on the growing number of
its local rivals by taking the plunge.
The Chartist says:
PLANET OIL CTG. has only a com-
paratively brief chart history, but it
certainly has been a spectacular one!
It is now showing promise of breaking
out of congestion area formed since the
peak in November, 1967. Investors
should also consider that PLANET OIL
has a 50 percent interest in PLANET
GOLD and PLANET METALS, which
are in similar technical situations with
the potential of upward movements.
There is a short- to medium-term objec-
tive of about 90c, after which the situa-
tion would call for reassessment, as it
has the potential of much higher
targets. However, there is the possi-
bility of a reaction along with any
reaction in the Queensland oil index in
the short term. Last sale price on
2/5/68 —33 c.

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
Behind the balance sheets
Sims keeps scrap competitive
WHILE MOST METAL shares have
boomed themselves silly, one company
in one branch of the metal business,
whose profits will probably rise by 25
percent or so this year, is still plodding
along out of the market spotlight. It is
scrap-metal merchant Albert G. Sims
Ltd., whose shares have been suffering
from a quite wrongly based three-point
attack.
The three misconceptions about
Albert G. Sims that are keeping the 40-
cent shares below $1 are easily disposed
of. Firstly, the reduction in earnings
reported in the third quarter report
last week (which followed a 30 percent
rise for the first half of the year) was
due only to delays in some substantial
shipments, which will presumably be
made up in the last quarter, and to
some temporary difficulties associated
with the drought in Victoria.. This did
not indicate any basic falling off in the
rate of profit improvement in the longer
term.
The second misconception is the fear
that all these new metals developments
could reduce the role of the scrap
merchant, particularly in steel, where
the metallised agglomerate plans (from
Hamersley and possibly Mt. Newman)
would remove the blast-furnace (where
scrap can be introduced) from the steel-
making process. But the facts are that
this will not have any effect at all on
demands, as there will always be
blast-furnaces, particularly in smaller
steel companies, which will use all the
scrap they can get.
The scrap-metal trade is a matter
of economics; it is the job of the trade
to be efficient enough to keep scrap
a competitive feed for open-hearths.
There will always be a demand for
scrap, provided the price is competitive
in relation to the cost of hot metal.
Charged into open-hearths, scrap is
actually more desirable than hot metal
because recovery of iron content is 98
percent, compared with even our best
ores of around 64 percent.
Scrap metal is always going to be
available from the motor-car industry
(arisings from factories add also from
old cars), arisings from fabricators,
agricultural scrap, and from demoli-
tions. Prices depend on supply and
demand, not moving strictly in accord-
ance with new metal prices, as is often
mistakenly believed. Sims acts as agent,
not as principal, and fluctuations in
non-ferrous metal prices do not affect
Sims because it operates on a set mar-
gin. The volume of business is the
main determinant of Sims’ profit.
So the third misconception, a fear
mat recent falls in copper prices could
catch out Sims, a large amount of whose
activities as a processor and merchant
of scrap are in copper, is also wrong.
Sims is an example of the general
neglect for worth-while investments
with proven performance in favor of the
glamorous mineral and oil stocks. For
it is a company whose operations are
steadily expanding and which has been
able to hold its profit-to-sales ratio up.
Immediate return of 7.7 percent on
an investment in Sims’ shares should be
very attractive to income-minded
investors, especially when earnings yield
is 16.5 percent, with the directors’

Sims’ business is in both ferrous and
non-ferrous metals, and it has purchas-
ing offices in all States except W.A.,
and processing plants for ferrous metals
in N.S.W., Victoria, S.A., and Queens-
land, for non-ferrous metals in N.S.W.,
and for aluminium only in Victoria
and Queensland, and a de-tinning plant
(one of only two in Australia) in Mel-
bourne.
The only pied-a-terre Sims has in
W.A. is the freshly revealed part-
ownership of mineral rights to iron-ore
deposits on the Nimingarra Temporary
Reserve (90 miles east of Port Hed-
land, near Mt. Goldsworthy), which
has been transferred on a royalty basis
with an option for the right to purchase.
Receipts for the consideration will be
brought to account during future years
as and when the reserves are developed.
A huge capital expenditure program
was initiated in 1964, with $2,625,000
spent in the two years to 1965-66. The
expenditure was designed to give in-
creased geographical coverage, and to
increase the efficiency of handling and
processing. Developments in the
industry required all materials to be
adequately processed to suit the con-
sumer, as the requirements of scrap-
metal processing are becoming more
sophisticated every day.
Directors did not specify what
capital expenditure was in 1966-67, but
including the September, 1966, takeover
of MP Metals Pty. Ltd., Heart Metal
Co. Pty. Ltd., and two subsidiaries,
fixed assets for the group rose $4.3
million. Unfortunately, as a result of a
Lligh Court decision, investment allow-
ance is not available to the company
on new plant. (Tax provided has been

$721,000, (compared with $493,000),
and in addition a scrap processing press
and auxiliary equipment of cranes has
been installed in Gillman, S.A., so it is
believed that capital expenditure for the
current financial year may approximate
$2 million, or at least be of the same
order as the past three years on aver-
age.
Afflicted by the mania for diversifica-
tion in 1960, Albert G. Sims talked
about manufacture of pipes and refined
foundry pig-iron, establishing a tin-lead-
antimony alloys plant, zinc, aluminium,
and copper recovery plants, a plant for
breaking-up ships and loading of deep-
sea vessels. It was intended to concen-
trate activities at Balmain on 21 acres
bought from Mort’s Dock, and sell the
seven acres at Alexandria, Mascot, and
Newtown.
Some of these plans came to nothing,
but others had unhappy results. Losses
in 1962 and 1963 totalling $895,000
were associated with the winding up of
a Hong Kong subsidiary, and pig-iron
plant in Melbourne, and an unfortunate
excursion into cargo and passenger
shipping, including operation of the old
Wanganella.
The Mort’s Dock property bought in
January, 1960, for $1,650,000 has by
now been seven-eighths sold, with only
two small blocks under lease and for
sale, besides a very small maintenance
depot. The company met with council
opposition, so had to reverse its plans
for centralisation at Balmain.
There are additional redundant
properties belonging to the MP Metal
companies, which formed all of
Cyclone’s scrap-metal interests, mainly
in Melbourne. By this purchase, Sims
bought an important competitor in its
own field, consolidating its position as
Australia’s largest scrap-metal dealer.
Cyclone received 250,000 Sims shares
as part consideration, but the company
is not telling if Cyclone still holds
these.
Directors anticipate that the total
purchase price and provision of work-
ing capital for the MP scrap companies
will be totally absorbed by 1969. The
chairman (Mr. G. S. Gilder) pro-
nounced last October that these acquisi-
tions would add substantially to profit
from 1969 onwards.
Share premium reserve was increased
by $74,000 on the issue of 250,000
shares to Cyclone, as part payment. The
company revalued the land upwards by
$ 1,332,000, but down-graded the invest-
ment in subsidiary companies by
$948,000, so that 'assets revaluation
reserve increased by a net $384,000.
The 1967 accounts reveal a decline
in current ratio from 1.4 to 0.9, as
overdraft rose by $1 million to $1.75
million, and creditors were extended
from $900,000 to $1.5 million. Sales of
redundant properties, when effected,
will considerably help the liquidity posi-
tion.
The very creditable reorganisation of
a company which strayed from its tradi-
tional field in which it had always per-
formed well, has been achieved by a
new managerial team. But the board
tends to be conservative, so no benefits
will be given without careful considera-
tion, which suggests that these may be
some time off yet. In the meanwhile,
this looks like a stock whose excellent
income yield ensures minimum down-
side risk with the prospect of eventual
capital benefits.

Security analysis
Pioneer’s rise in the aggregate
THE CONSTRUCTION materials
stone, sand, and gravel ranked No. 3
in the Australian mineral industry in
1966 in terms of value of output, which
was equal to about half the size of the
coal industry, a little behind the copper
output, but ahead of lead, iron ore, zinc,
beach sands, and gold. Materials pro-
duced by the quarrying people include
dimension stones, and crushed and
broken stones such as granite, basalt
(blue metal), sandstone, limestone,
marble, and various types of decom-
posed rock, shales, and gritty loam.
Official statistics on the quarrying
industry are very incomplete, but in
appropriate terms the annual value of
output of the base construction
materials is about $9O-100 million, and
the annual rate of growth is about
4 percent a year.
Over recent years, a number of large
companies have grown up in operating
fully integrated quarrying operations,
which have extended to ready-mixed
concrete, to the supply and fixing of
marble, terrazzo, and other decorative
building materials, and also to hot-mix
asphalt. Hot-mix asphalt, which is still
only in its infancy in Australia, is com-
posed of metal aggregate 60-65 percent,
sand 35 percent, and bitumen 5 percent,
which is mixed and laid at a tempera-
ture of about 300 degrees F.
Pioneer Concrete Service Limited, one
of the Australian majors in this league,
had its beginnings in 1949 when two
men formed a business on a capital
of $lOOO, and with two employees sup-
plied and laid concrete for builders.
The public company was formed in
1959 with an issued capital of $240,000
and total assets employed of $1.4 million.
Since that time, issued capital has in-
creased 38 times, total assets by almost
33 times, and earned for ordinary by
about 34 times. Tristan Antico, the
founder of the original business in 1949,
is chairman and managing director of
the public company and at 43 years of
age leads a team of senior executives
whose average age -is 39-40. Pioneer
Concrete now ranks among the top
100 industrial companies in Australia,
according to the Delfin Digest.
With more than 1300 employees and
about 250 owner-drivers, Pioneer oper-
ates a total of 175 processing centres —
124 in Australia and New Guinea, and
51 plants in Europe, the United King-
dom, Israel, and Hong Kong. It would
be close to the mark to suggest that
80 percent of the group’s funds em-
ployed are invested in Australia, and
20 percent in the overseas ventures,
which commenced in 1962. In specifics,
quarrying is the main activity in the
orbit of the Australian operations,
absorbing possibly 45 percent of group-
invested funds,, and contributing over
40 percent of group profits; ready-
mixed concrete comes next with about
15 percent of group funds; followed by
the masonry supply division with about
12 percent; and the recently acquired
F. W. Williams group with about 8 per-
cent.
In quarrying, Pioneer has about 30
percent of the Australian metropolitan
market. Pioneer is the only company
in Brisbane with modern crushing facili-
ties, and it has under its control proven
reserves sufficient to last 100 years;
whilst in Perth the reserves are also
estimated to be equal to about 100
years’ production. In Sydney, the com-
pany has reserves equal to more than
50 years’ production up its sleeve, now
that it has agreed in principle with
ICIANZ to work the Bass Point (Port
Kembla) aggregate deposits. The inten-
tion is to use sea transport to ship
the aggregate to Sydney, a distance of
about 50 miles. In Melbourne the com-
pany is flexing its muscles for an all-
out drive to greatly expand its share
of the market, and since the acquisition
of Rowland Quarries Limited in 1967
large deposits have been acquired at
Lysterfield, which have enough reserves
to last Pioneer for about 70 years. The
battle for honors in the quarry industry
in Melbourne promises to be interesting,
with Boral Limited, who having
digested three big quarrymasters in
Albion, Reid, and Bayview, is currently
fighting hard to hold on to its 58/60
percent share of the market in that
city. In all its Australian operations
Pioneer is currently working a total of
31 quarries.
Ready-mixed concrete which is pre-
mixed before transport to the building
or construction site is perhaps the com-
pany operation best known to most
investors, and Pioneer’s green transit
mixer trucks are a familiar sight
throughout most of the Australian cities.
With some 69 plants located in all Aus-
tralian States, the company has about
30-35 percent of the total Australian
ready-mixed-concrete business. This
market is growing at 8 percent a year.
The acquisition of the F. W. Williams
group in 1967 enabled Pioneer to reap
a substantial capital profit, for this com-
pany was flush with a large parcel of
shares in Australian Consolidated Indus-
tries, which was sold on the market and
turned into cash. Williams also brought
into the Pioneer stable a group of diver-
sified companies manufacturing convey-
ing equipment and plastic products in
Sydney; plastic products in Perth; grow-
ing and processing tea in the New
Guinea highlands; and in the distribu-
tion of agricultural supplies and imple-
ments in New South Wales. The
Pioneer people seem well satisfied with
their venture in the Williams group; the
conveying equipment subsidiaiy R. J.
Moulang is already producing equipment
to supply the growing capital require-
ments of Pioneer’s quarry division, and
the tea plantation, which is growing tea
said to be equal to the world’s finest,
should prove a winner when it reaches
full maturity in the 19705.
In 1962, Pioneer went international
in an integrated quarry ready-mixed
operation in Hong Kong and the
international division now supplies
about 20 percent of the overall group’s
annual profits. Pioneer has three
plants in Hong Kong, 29 plants in the
U.K., 13 in Italy, five in Spain, and
four in Israel. The Italian operation
is 70 percent owned and the Barcelona
(Spain) plant is 64 percent owned,
but the other international units of the
group are wholly owned by the Aus-
tralian company. Apart from the
integrated Hong Kong processing
centre, the Pioneer group operates only
ready-mixed plants in its overseas
establishments. Pioneer can already
boast that it is the fifth-largest producer
of ready-mixed concrete in the United
Kingdom, and the opportunities for
expansion in Europe are considerable,
bearing in mind that the current output
in ready-mixed concrete still only
represents 29 percent of the market
for portland cement in the U.K., and
the figure drops sharply to 20 percent
in the case of Israel, 12 percent for
Italy, and only 9 percent for Spain.
A 50/50 partnership with Shell in
Pioneer Asphalts Pty. Limited, with
Pioneer as manager, has given the
group about 20 percent of the Aus-
tralian market for hot-mix asphalt,
which is very creditable considering
that this share of the overall business
has been acquired in only 18 months
of operation.

Mining
Australian Dev....and Peko
THE RISE IN GOLD of late does
seem far less ephemeral than its earlier
burst upwards, which occurred on the
reopening of the London gold market,
and its steady 'march upwards must be
encouraging to those who are looking
for a price of SU.S.4O (or even higher)
so as to justify purchase of some of
those companies which appeared in The
Bulletin of March 23. One company
which has been rising lately, appar-
ently regardless of day-to-day move-
ments in the gold price, is Australian
Development NL, and at least part of
the demand for these shares is due to
rumors of a possible takeover bid from
Peko-Wallsend Limited.
Quite apart from this possibility there
is the fact that the company has in
past years had no recourse to the sub-
sidy in order to earn a profit, and is
thus in a position to benefit to the full
from any increase in revenue arising
from higher gold prices. It is, how-
ever, slightly dangerous to use the com-
pany’s performance in recent years as
a guide to future levels of cost, as its
operations at Tennant Creek are being
entirely reorganised following a cave-
in late last year, which made its mine
and plant unusable. At that time,
reserves of ore were stated at about
three years’ life, 86,800 tons of ore of
an average grade of 23.4 dwt. per
ton as against treatment of some 27,000
tons of ore per year.
The cave-in occurred under the area
where the company’s plant was sited
and made this unusable, too, and the
net result has been that the mine is
to be worked as an open-cut and a
new and larger mill is to be installed,
with capacity to treat ore at more than
twice the previous rate. In keeping with
this new style of operation, ore reserves
have been reassessed and now stand at
400,000 tons of ore of about 10 dwt.
of gold per ton. As this figure includes
100,000 tons of 20 dwt. ore, it can be
seen that ore reserves have increased
quite a lot over the previous 86,800 tons
of 23.4 dwt. ore. This increase, though,
will not by itself mean any great in-
crease in the life of the mine as the
larger treatment plant has a planned
upward limit of around 135,000 tons
on an annual basis. In fact, the switch
to an open-cut lower-grade operation
will bring an overall drop in ounces of
gold produced. If the company was
already in receipt of a gold subsidy this
would be fairly serious, but as it is not
receiving the subsidy, the reduction in
gold production will be almost offset by
the cost savings arising from open-cut
mining and a higher rate of ore treat-
ment in up-to-date machinery, and the
company’s profitability would be com-
pletely restored to its former high level
at a price for gold of SU.S.4O.
In years past, Australian Development
has been a prolific dividend payer, and
last year paid 15 cents per share. Divi-
dends have been suspended until the
mine is on a fully productive level, but
after the end of this year chances seem
pretty good for a resumption of divi-
dends, and although nominal mine life
is still fairly limited, it is reasonable to
expect that the company will still be
in business in six to eight years’ time.
But while the present share price
reflects the company’s position as a
formerly very efficient gold producer,
and hence a potentially rewarding hedge
against further increases in the price
of gold, it is worth remembering that
it also has a 40 percent interest in two
mineral claims in the Boorabbin district
of Western Australia, near Coolgardie
(subject to Conwest (Australia) NL
earning a 60 percent interest by the
expenditure of $100,000). And on its
own leases at Tennant Creek further
increases in gold reserves can be expec-
ted; in recent months drilling has been
concentrated on the capping rock in the
vicinity of the intended open-cut, and
besides gold, isolated holes have shown
copper-gold values of limited value. In
the Noble’s Nob mine itself signs of
copper mineralisation were encountered
below the working level. The history of
the Tennant Creek field has shown
that the richer gold mines, such as
Noble’s Nob (owned by Australian
Development) and Peko’s Orlando and
Juno mine, as well as many smaller
mines worked out years ago, have all
been relatively shallow, and the copper
orebodies like the ones at Peko itself,
Ivanhoe, and the yet-to-be-mined War-
rego deposit, are generally at somewhat
deeper levels.
The apparent proximity of Austra-
lian Development’s Noble’s Nob mine
to Peko’s new and very rich Juno mine
(they are but four miles apart) should
not be given undue significance, even
though both mines contain some of
Australia’s richest gold ore. Of perhaps
even greater importance for the future
is the continuing exploration of the
Tennant Creek field. Australian Devel-
opment’s open-cut will be something of
an innovation in the area.
These technical considerations apart,
the idea of a bid from Peko would make
fairly good commercial sense; the com-
pany has liquid funds of about $1
million dollars from its issue to share-
holders early in April, and in addition
to this owns shares and other fixed-
interest securities worth about $1.5 mil-
lion. For the issue of something more
than $500,000 of its own capital, Peko
would acquire these liquids as well as
the quite promising gold mine (An
interesting by-product of such a merger
would be to put Peko among prospec-
tive nickel miners.)

Alternatives to Chowilla
PROSPECTS FOR building the
Chowilla dam looked bleaker than ever
last week when, following a verdict
from the River Murray Commission,
the Minister for National Development
announced that an alternative site for
a new dam would be examined to
replace it. Nor would the site be in or
anywhere near South Australia, but
rather on the Mitta Mitta River, in
Victoria’s north-eastern highlands, far
to the east.
Of course, the writing had long been
on the wall for the Chowilla, whose
cost had crept up to an estimated
$7O million last year from the com-
paratively innocent figure of $2B mil-
lion when it was first costed in 1962.
The Snowy Mountains Authority is
being called on to investigate the site,
which lies around Dartmouth, at the
junction of the Dart and Mitta Mitta
Rivers, south-east of Albury, one of
three alternatives to Chowilla that have
already been examined by the River
Murray Commission (the other two
were near Mt. Gibbs, also on the Mitta
Mitta, and near Tom Groggin, on the
Murray itself). The idea is that Dart-
mouth and Chowilla will be compared
on both a costs and a benefits basis,
but as well as this the Minister ap-
peared to place great emphasis on
salinity studies to be carried out con-
currently, to ascertain the effect the
establishment of storages at either site
would have on salinity in the Murray.
The threat of aggravating the already
very troublesome level of salinity in
the river’s lower reaches has all along
been one of the most contentious
aspects of building a dam at Chowilla.
It is feared that a high rate of evapora-
tion from this dam (a shallow one
over a very wide area) as projected
would lift the salinity of the stored
water to an intolerable level as well as
waste about a sixth of it each year.
It is also feared that the hydraulic
head of water behind the dam would
draw subterranean salts into the river as
it flowed downstream. From an
engineer’s viewpoint that would seem
to be pouring oil on the burning
salinity problem.
The salinity problem was basic to
the River Murray Commission’s decision
to turn its back on Chowilla. Even
without this dam, some doubt still sur-
rounds the degree of success likely to be
achieved by the massive sums currently
being spent in the north-west of Vic-
toria to keep the level of salinity in
the Murray down (something perhaps
more vital to South Australian than to
Victorian water users, though there
are certainly a lot of the latter, say
around Mildura down to the S.A.
border, who are affected). In fact,
two urgent projects costing $3.6 million
and being financed by a grant under
the National Water Resources Develop-
ment program are expected to be com-
pleted in north-west Victoria in four
months’ time, both to reduce the flow
of salty water into the Murray.
With these implications to chew over
it seems silly of State-proud politicians
such as Senator Laucke (Lib., S.A.) to
talk as if South Australia’s development
is being sacrificed for the ha’p’orth of
tar ($7O million) required to build
Chowilla “surely the future of South
Australia is worth more than that,” he
said last week. True, as he stated, the
State received some assurances that the
dam would be built when assenting to
the Snowy Mountains scheme, but in
the ’forties little was known of the
hydraulic problems that have emerged
since Chowilla was put on the drawing
board. It may also be debatable whether
Chowilla, which appears to have a
bigger watershed, would have a better
chance of being filled than a dam on
the Mitta Mitta, as he claims “Why
fill a tank with a back veranda run-off
when you can use the whole house?”
So though Chowilla appears to be dead,
South Australian politicians are
certainly not letting it lie down.
In the meantime new hope emerges
for super-dry States like South Australia
in a recently announced breakthrough
in desalination techniques by Alcoa of
America, following four years’ success-
ful testing of prototype installations pro-
ducing 10,000 gallons of fresh water a
day by a flash distillation process which
utilises the temperature differential be-
tween streams of warm and cold water.
The process, which is estimated to be
able to desalinate huge volumes of water
at about one-third to one half the cost
of plants at present under construction
or on order in the United States, is
designed to operate on streams of waste
hot water available at industrial plants.
The process can also function on sun-
warmed seawater, production of pure
water being obtained at temperature
differences as low as 20 degrees between
warm and cold water. Because of pat-
ent applications no detailed description
of the process is yet available, but, nat-
urally, it has a very high aluminium
content in its pipes, valves, and tubing,
and this apparently ensures an absence
of scale formation and corrosion. The
mention of this process is not to be
taken as hinting that its use in South
Australia would compensate for not
building the Chowilla dam, but simply to
show that its future applications should
be watched as opening up new prospects
for desalination in Australia.
Agrisearch
Planning for future droughts
THE RURAL Liaison Service of the
Reserve Bank has released the results of
its follow-up survey of the effects of
the 1965-66 drought in northern New
South Wales. This study is of especial
interest because it is more precise and
searching than any of its kind yet
undertaken in Australia. On this
account, conclusions and recommenda-
tions arising from it will probably have
a considerable influence on future
drought-relief policies and planning.
Although the drought in the N.S.W.
north is claimed to have been one of
the most severe ever encountered in
the region—livestock numbers were
reduced by about a third and wheat
acreage halved—very few farmers will
be long in recovering their economic
health and strength. This is perhaps
the most significant of the survey’s find-
ings. It means that moneylenders can
extend liberal credit to drought-stricken
farmers with confidence. After all, the
world does owe farmers a living,
whether drought-affected or not, pro-
vided they are striving to produce the
things the world wants. The aim
generally should be to allow farmers to
borrow to the maximum and even
beyond with a minimum of fuss.
Another conclusion from the survey
is that credit is the best help to offer
farmers during and immediately after
a drought. Supplies of fodder, reduc-
tions in freight rates, emergency irriga-
tion, additional stock-watering points,
and so on are of dubious or relatively
minor value. Credit is essential for
“carry-on” activities and restocking.

And it is to the credit of the New South
Wales Government, which made money
available on reasonable terms, and other
lending sources that 88 percent of the
total amount of money sought by
farmers was granted.
By February, 1967, despite the severe
setback in income over the preceding
two years, most farmers were in a fairly
sound economic position. The surveyors
estimated that, after making allowances
for living expenses and running costs,
the sheep-wheat farmers should be able
to redeem their liabilities within the
next four or five years, provided, of
course, another bad drought does not
intervene. The pure pastoralists, a
minority group, will recover much
more slowly, however. It could take
them over 25 years to catch up unless
they manage somehow to lift their
average incomes over the level prevail-
ing before the drought.
The survey was based on a sample
of some 200 grazing and wheat-sheep
properties representing about 5000 such
enterprises around Armidale, Glen
Innes, Warialda, Moree, Narrabri,
Walgett, and Brewarrina. The sampling
is thought to have been very fair.
Possibly it carries a slight bias favoring
properties with a bit better-than-aver-
age assets and having liabilities a bit
below average. Farmers in other parts
of Australia will be somewhat surprised
to learn that the 200 sampled producers
hold average assets, apart from land,
livestock, and plant, amounting to
$34,000. This is mostly in the form of
town houses and shares. On the other
hand, their average indebtedness was
only $23,500.
The non-farm assets of these farmers
made up 18 percent of their total
worth. Personal effects such as furni-
ture, private cars, and the surrender
value of life-insurance policies were
not included in these calculations by
the accountants. Average net cash in-
come before and during the drought
summarises the story pretty well. In
1963/64 incomes averaged $15,000.
The next year, as the drought devel-
oped, they fell to $9500, and in 1965/
66 bottomed at $2250. In 1966/67
recovery was marked with the average
income rising to $9250. These figures
do not include the usual allowances
for depreciation, taxes, and the farmer’s
living expenses.
The decline in cattle numbers was
not so much the result of deaths as
disposal by forced sale. In contrast,
sheep deaths, apparently, were high,
and, of course, natural increase was
virtually halted. But while the overall
reduction in sheep numbers was put at
36 percent, graziers managed to keep
losses of ewes down to 13 percent. The
survey tacitly assumes that the sheep
died of starvation, but cold or disease
striking weak animals could have been
the main killers. Accurate information
on this point is needed if farmers are
to devise better tactics for the next
drought.
The survey showed that hand-feeding
was definitely effective, but not neces-
sarily profitable. It also found that the
farmers intend to increase their reserves
of fodder in future by two- to three-
fold. Unfortunately, the Bank’s econo-
mists do not say whether this is a wise
move, but merely remark that there
must be some level of reserves worth
keeping against the .possibility of short
droughts. To feed or not to feed is the
question that vexes every farmer, and
it is deplorable that some reasonably
simple formula has not been developed
by now which will yield a straight
answer to this question in each man’s
situation.
Another nettle which the Bank people
have failed to grasp in an otherwise
commendable study is the business of
analysing to what extent the drought was
self-inflicted by over-grazing. On this
hangs a vital consideration: should the
grazing policy be for light or heavy
stocking or somewhere in between? A
middle-of-the-road policy would seem to
be wrong more often than either of the
extremes, since apparently hand-feeding
is uneconomic.

An actor in search of ideas
by SANDRA HALL
MARK McMANUS is sitting in an
Epping beer garden in front of a roast
lamb sandwich and is sounding dis-
tinctly unimpressed about the prospect
of becoming a film star.
At 28, he is doing about as well
as any actor in this country he has
had only two weeks off in the past
three years, went straight from the
starring role in “Half a Sixpence,” to
the lead in Tim Burstall’s film “Two
Thousand Weeks,” and is now
rehearsing for the pilot of ATN7’s new
drama series, which is said to be about
an Aboriginal boxer and was called
“The Doon-Gara Kid,” but isn’t any
more. At this moment, little more is
known about it.
Right now, it’s lunchtime, and
McManus, in black sweater and jeans,
is talking about films. “I’m enormously
interested in them, because they can
make things so immediate, but,” and
here a slow smile breaks up the bony,
big-eyed face, “they mean nothing to
me as an actor, because they are so
complicated and involved in their
continuity.
“I once read an interview with a
film director in which he was asked
what, in his opinion, had made a film
of his so good ~. . the script, the
actors . . . and he said they all
helped, but the most important thing
was that they’d been using a type of
film stock not available any more.
Well, when something gets that
technical, it’s lost me. I’ve seen some
rushes of this film we’ve just done, so
I know it’s beautifully photographed,
but I won’t really know what it’s
like until it’s been edited. Film is
very much a group art.”
McManus was cast in “Two
Thousand Weeks” after the producer-
director, Tim Burstall, saw his work
in ABC-TV plays and in an episode
of “Skippy.”
“I read the script, and I couldn’t
quite see how some of it would work
mainly because I see things in
relationships and the film guys see
them in pictures. But after Tim
Burstall explained how the flashbacks
worked, I understood it.”
The film, which involves 29 actors,
four of them in principal roles, has
been shot during the past 11 weeks in
and around Melbourne. “A lot of
people have asked me why it wasn’t
done in color, but I’m glad it wasn’t,
because the countryside looks so much
more interesting in black and white.
Even the beaches, which have usually
been filmed when they’re crowded. We
did our sequences in the early morning
or during the week at Portsea when it
was deserted, and it looks extra-
ordinarily romantic.”
But now, for McManus at least, the
film is over. He is sliding comfortably
from “Two Thousand Weeks” a
project which holds more excitement
for Australian film buffs than all the
international efforts under way here at
present - in,to his next part. No
nostalgia that’s reserved for the
theatre just determination about
getting himself back to England.
Born in Scotland, he came to Aus-
tralia eight years ago because he was
“fed up with England.” He had done
no acting; in fact, he had been studyr
ing at a London art school, his ambi-
tions fixed on stage design.
“That was before I discovered I
wouldn’t be any good at it, which sent
me right down,” he says, looking dis-
proportionately cheerful about it.
“When I got here, I did all sorts of
jobs a laborer on the roads, worked
in parks, in a printer’s. Then I joined
the New Theatre, because I didn’t
know anyone, and they asked me if I
acted. I said I didn’t, really, but I
probably could I suppose I would
have done anything they asked me.
“I hadn’t thought about acting
before. Oh, yes,” he says, suddenly
and genuinely intense about it, “I was
tremendously interested in the theatre.
It was just that I’d been thinking as
a stage designer before.”
He was playing in “The Quare
Fellow,” when Robin Love joy, of the
Elizabethan Trust, saw him act and
asked him if he wanted to become
a professional. “I was excited about
it, because, for one thing, it meant
getting away from all that clocking
in and out. I hated all that. So many
times, I was on my way to work, then
decided to jump off the bus and go
to the pictures.”
His first professional acting job was
a tour with the Young Elizabethan
Players—“jolly hard work, but the
countryside was fantastic and I loved
the plays, in fact, I loved everything.
“After that, I mucked about in TV
for a while, then did my first really
good thing —‘The Private Ear and the
Public Eye’— at the Phillip. ‘Beckett’
at the Independent came after that, and
I suppose that was my best break. But
I did a terrible thing next—‘ls Aus-
tralia Really Necessary?’, a revue with
Miriam Karlin. I didn’t think it was
very funny, and I had nothing to do
in it—that’s why I hated it. ‘Luv’ at the
Phillip was the thing I enjoyed doing
most —I loved that play, and I loved
working with the American director.”
The past three'years, with jobs fol-
lowing one another in steady succession,
have now brought McManus to a de-
cision. “I’ve got stale. I find I’m fall-
ing back on things because I know
they’ll work. So I think it’s time to
go away. I’m certainly worried about
it being tough—l like money, but I do
feel I want to go. I’d like to get into
a really good rep. in England.
“Yes, I’ve been very pleased when
critics have praised me, and I haven’t
minded when they’ve said things against
me. Why so many actors here are hurt
by critics is that they can put you out
of work. I think they’re that powerful.
If all the critics slammed a particular
picture by MARK STRIZIC
Mark McManus
play, I don’t think that play would run
for very long. If we had properly sub-
sidised theatre, no one’s living would
be threatened by the critics and we’d
be able to work together, both looking
for perfection.
“Something very drastic will have to
happen in the theatre, but I don’t know
what it is. No, I don’t think the answer
lies with the new plays in which the
audience are brought into the play, and
so on. That’s just a writer and a
director getting up on a soapbox—it’s
got nothing to do with portraying life.
I suppose the best way is for groups
of actors to get used to working well—
as the repertory companies do.
“I’ll come back here, because Aus-
tralia is a very good country to work
in, but at the moment I have to get
fresh ideas, because I just haven’t got
anything new to contribute.”

Superlatives for
a golden Girl
By JOHN CARGHER
The Girl of the Golden West (Puccini).
Princess Theatre, Melbourne.
PITY TFIE POOR critic! Overjoyed
at the much above Trust average pro-
duction standards of “The Magic
Flute” and “Tannhauser,” I praised
excessively, to be faced now with hav-
ing to find genuine superlatives, for
“The Girl of the Golden West.”
Stephen Hall’s production is quite out
of the Elizabethan Trust’s class. If this
company has often attained European
standards musically, I cannot remember
when, if ever, the same could be said of
the production side. What a pity all
this love and care should have been
lavished on second-rate Puccini!
“The Girl of the Golden West” was
written for the Metropolitan Opera
House, New York, where it saw the
light of day in 1910 with Caruso and
Destinn. Based on a hopelessly out-
dated play by David Belasco, it is the
only true horse opera in the real sense,
a genuine period Western with genuine
cardboard characters whose motivations
are firmly based in theatrical conven-
tion rather than life.
To stage all this in English would
produce a lot more than the few laughs
at present provided by the occasional
“ugh” of the incredible Indian, Billy
Jackrabbit, or his squaw, Wowkle. Pro-
ducing “The Girl” in Italian comes off
brilliantly, and the excellent realistic
sets by Friedrich Bliem help no end;
and Puccini does need all the help he
can get in this case! Except for
“the” aria (“Ch’ella mi creda”), there
is little beyond some fine ensembles for
the miners to hold our interest, and it is
noteworthy that only revivals with top
stars are attempted these days. The
Trust has one in Donald Smith, praise
for whom is getting to be positively
monotonous. Outsiders reading our
reports must find it hard to believe
that a tenor of such quality hides him-
self Down Under.
Marcella Reale is not in his class,
but her Minnie is a well-balanced
interpretation. Too pretty, too young,
and too feminine to be really in charac-
ter, her voice is good but not strong
enough to cover up Puccini’s defici-
encies. Alan Light’s sheriff is excellent,
black in character and black in voice.
There can be few companies in the
world which can produce an ensemble
of singers and actors of this standard.
Robert Gard’s senile Trin, in character
even when taking his bow, and John
Pringle’s superbly sung Wells Fargo
agent take the honors by only a small
margin over Joseph Powell, Luciano
Borghi, Robin Gordon, and the others.
Only Ronald Maconaghie is not sonor-
ous as Sonora, an important role which
goes for very little. The playing of the
orchestra under Robert Feist continues
the high standard it has achieved under
the übiquitous Cillario this year, and
Feist’s own contribution is firm and
authoritative. One can argue whether
“The Girl” should have been produced;
one cannot argue about the perform-
ance, it is a model of what the Trust
should and could always do.

The over-puffed
and the great
By ELWYN LYNN
Aubusson Tapestries. Kym Bonython,
Sydney.
Nolan’s Burke and Wills. Stern’s,
Sydney.
CRITICS TOO often fume about cata-
logue panegyrics as if their writers were
breaking union rules, but up a protest
placard must go about the unsigned
puff that accompanies the fine
tapestries at Bonython’s. Too much is
claimed for these objects: that they are
mobile murals, can be used as screens,
have all the qualities of paintings and
can take their places, and despite the
shift of image from the biblical bond
legendary to the abstract retain the
same aesthetic impact. It tells us that
the Australians Plate, Coburn, and
Schlicht have moved into this “un-
fa'miliar ethos” you could hardly get
an “ethos” more unfamiliar and that
we have here “luminous and command-
ing tapestries of extraordinary strength
and grandeur.”
All that misses the real virtues of
tapestries; you might say that the Zad-
kine, Corbusier, and Kyino have a hint
of grandeur, but surely tapestry is what
makes grandeur intimate, whether it’s
a triumphal march by Rubens or the
Gothic legends of the Unicorn; in the
best sense it domesticates the strutting
warrior and the woodland fertility
symbol. Tapestry befits the relaxed
interior; it softens forms, deflates their
impetuosity, but the best are able to
retain their integrity while becoming
involved with their environment like
paintings by Pollock, Newman, Louis,
or Nolan.
Aubusson have placed a lot of faith
in, and orders for, Mathew Mategot,
whose twenty-five boring conglomera-
tions of torn, autumn leaf forms at
the Adelaide Festival recalled those
illustrations of crowded, restless wall-
papers in cluttered rooms that appar-
ently represent the acme of taste in
French interiors: forms so busy that
they annihilate or neutralise one
another.
No grandeur there, nor in Marc
Petit’s surreal-nursery pieces for the
visual punishment of children, in
Loewer’s tense geometries, nor in
Longobardi’s marble-cake convolutions.
Picasso illustrates how little grandeur is
needed; his tapestry, in outlined, flat,
subdued fawn, grey, soft brown-and-
black shapes, coming straight from
Cubism, lets a central plane jut at the
viewer, enlivens flat forms by outlines
and harnesses an imperative black with
a loose, lattice grid. In contrast, Co-
burn is too assertive though worth
comparison with the Master in his
frontal, heraldic emblems; Picasso-
understates his mild play with illusions.
Such illusions are merely optical
devices in Le Normand, whose pale
triangles of color gently form a circle
and drift away at the edges, but Pic-
asso’s illusionistic balance of form and
space is positively resolved in Sonia
Delaunay’s near-squares and near-
circles, with purples, sharp greens,,
stippled grey, and unresilient reds:
the circular movement looks tempor-
arily arrested, and the loose, intuitive
shapes are the antithesis of heraldic
certainty.
You wouldn’t need the Bonython
catalogue introduction (the exhibition
deserved better) to show what an art-
market town Sydney has become, and
one doesn’t have to advocate an old
Leftist, bohemian line to note that the
art market place, with its imports and'
its promotion and adulation of the
locally established, in effect down-
grades the indigenous innovators.
Barbara Rose has recently warned that
you don’t look for new talent in a
market-city like New York; at the end
of 1966 Patrick Heron was complain-
ing of how the art market men were
neglecting, among others, the younger
abstractionists. The marketing spirit
reached its apogee on April 27 when
the ebullient Barry Stern, the first
dealer to advertise regularly on Satur-
days, took a full page of the “Sydney
Morning Herald,” with a reproduction
of Nolan’s Burke and Wills Leaving
Melbourne (36in. x 48in., 1950), for
which he wants $35,000, to declare that
it is the greatest Australian painting of
this century and should not leave the
country.
Apart from the neglect I note above,
there is a lot to be said for such
marketing—we can compare Coburn
and Picasso, and Mr. Stern has forced
us to ask whether the Nolan is the
best in its category; are there no better
Nolans? It is a question that can be
sensibly asked. Do we sensibly ask
what is the greatest Australian novel of
the century? I’m sure The Bulletin
would like your opinions on what is the
greatest painting of the century. Mr.
Stern’s (i.e., Nolan’s) is a beautifully
greyed, tonal piece, adumbrating more
liquescent works of the early ’sixties
with its* dream-like space. It’s not
such a typical Nolan, but investors may
note that it’s not the typical Corot that
excites.


Theatre
Entertainment?
By DENIS O'BRIEN
At Least You Get Something Out of
That. Rodney Milgate. Old Tote,
Sydney.
IT WAS MY astonished delight to dis-
cover that I share the authorship of the
only comprehensible part of this latest
theatrical product of Mr. Milgate’s
high and windy mind. The first few
minutes of the play are given over to
the replaying of parts of an ABC
broadcast John West and I did some
12 months or so ago. We reviewed Mr.
Milgate’s first play, “A Refined Look
at Existence,” and the Old Tote’s tape
recording picks up the broadcast at
about the place where I am in indig-
nant full throttle against the incompre-
hensibility of Milgate’s symbolism. Just
when I am getting to the choicest part
of the broadcast, a grubby character in
the latest play limps across to the radio
and snuffs me out, growling the ex-
pletive “Garbage!” as he does so.
Which is a great pity, for the entire
broadcast was much more entertaining
than Mr. Milgate’s own garbage. My
services are available to any playwright
in difficulties.
But enough of this uneasy narcissism.
The conceit either of playwright
Milgate or director Robin Lovejoy,
who has staged both plays inherent
In the device is fairly typical of those
who believe their intellectualism is
adrift in a sea of philistinism.
As a playwright, Milgate is
determinedly addressing an intellectual
elite. He should hold a party in a
broom cupboard and give readings of
his works instead of tempting an intel-
ligent public to believe they have Great
Meaning. Wordy private jokes of the
type of “At Least, etc.” are progres-
sively alienating a theatre public,
stunned into boredom by privileged
poseurs who don’t really care if we
get their message or not.
I won’t pretend that I understand
any more of what this play is trying
to say than that it seems to be a
harangue against most of the well-riven
ills of modern society materialism,
conformity, soullessness, ugliness,
mental sterility, tit is set in a “decadent
country town” in New South Wales
(Mr. Milgate’s favorite microcosm) and
Is littered with Greek mythology. Its
characters talk, talk, talk, and the
whole thing just bores, bores, bores.
When I left at 9.45 p.m., with half
of the second act still to run, three or
four of the characters were reciting
advertising slogans. Please don’t tell me
how it ended.
Mr. Milgate should be indebted to
director Lovejoy and his cast (Ron
Haddrick, especially) for putting a
certain vibrancy into the production,
but I have the feeling he is about to
sulk off to America with his Harkness
Fellowship, to opt out of Utopia.
COMMUNICATING
FACTS AND OPINIONS ON ARTS CRAFTS AND COMMUNICATIONS
PINNED BUTTERFLY
WE MENTALLY applauded a witty
listener’s letter read during a recent
edition of Ellis Blain’s program “Let’s
Find Out” on ABC radio. Prompted
by a “TV Times” article which had
tagged the program “a Ph.D. course,”
the letter chipped away with a skilful
wickedness at “Ellis the don” and pre-
tended to chide the interviewer for
her cheek in pinpointing his habit of
making pronouncements rather than
conversation and correcting her ques-
tions.
It was read by Blain’s partner of
the day, Carol Raye, whose voice made
no effort to conceal her glee, while we
felt we detected in Blain’s bravely
manufactured laugh a little more
hollowness than usual. So much pom-
posity goes with his careful tones and
his similarly impeccable liberal views
that one is tempted to gloat over the
slightest attempt to puncture it.
Occasionally his sparring partners
manage it. New Zealand academic
Coral Lansbury has proved herself the
most imaginatively irrational reac-
tionary of them all. After ten minutes
of her frequently unfathomable argu-
ment, Blain has the resistance of a
pinned butterfly. Usually, however, it
is he who does the pinning, often with
the aid of information gleaned pains-
takingly from “Newsweek,” the
“Observer,” and, of course, The
Bulletin.
Last week it was Sheila Scotter’s turn
to suffer. After hazarding a guess that
Iron Mountain was a neighbor of Mt.
Isa’s, she was treated to a resume of
the controversial American book
“Report from Iron Mountain” and
asked to comment on its conclusions
that war is economically necessary.
It isn’t clear whether Blain wasn’t
playing fair or just hadn’t heard, but
he neglected to inform her that the
group of U.S. intellectuals described in
the book as having produced the report
are widely considered to be hypothetical
rather than real. Consequently, the
discussion had rather an eerie quality.
They’re all pitfalls of showbusiness,
one supposes, although Ellis Blain
mightn’t describe them quite that way.
CARTHAGE UNDER FIRE
WARS BETWEEN showbusiness and
the critics in Australia are puny guer-
illa skirmishes by comparison with the
bitter clashes in London and New York.
Indeed, there’s almost something un-
healthy about the sulky shots fired across
the chasm in Australia: showbusiness
here either quietly bans a critic from
future performances or lobs a libel writ
to shut him up. None of the heady
stuff of New York, where David Mer-
rick’s seasonal round of critic-baiting
on Broadway often offers better enter-
tainment than some of his shows;
nothing to equal Tony Richardson’s
recent hysterical broadside against the
London film critics.
Richardson prohibited the critics
from attending the premiere of his film
“The Charge of the Light Brigade” in
a letter to “The Times,” which accused
them of just about everything short of
treason.
The daily critics kept their cool
against the onslaught, and not all of
them troubled to reply, but the battle
was joined on their behalf by some of
the weekend commentators. Bernard
Levin, whose sharply observant and
abrasive prose is one of the most com-
pelling features of Fleet Street, lunged
at Richardson and his followers in a
devastating piece for the “New States-
man.”
Levin, a one-time drama critic of
the “Daily Mail,” said the chief fault of
critics of films, TV, and plays in Britain
was that they were ridiculously over-
indulgent. “Nobody who does not see
as many plays as the critics do that
is, about 150 a year has any idea,
not even the faintest, and most distant
notion of the sheer lousiness of prac-
tically everything shovelled on to the
stage and offered to critical inspection.
Fully seven out of ten of the plays and
productions I saw professionally were
rubbish, so far beneath any kind of
critical contempt that I am astounded,
looking back at my own moderation,
which led me to describe them as, for
instance, worthless drivel, when what
was properly called for was some really
strong language . .
An even higher proportion of films
were unreviewable trash, wrote Levin,
and it was no wonder that critics
became mentally lazy. “There is not a
critic alive, or dead, who has not
eventually abandoned, under the relent-
less pressure of the sheer impossibility
of saying every day of the week that
Carthage ought to be destroyed, his
critical integrity, and taken to saying
instead that Carthage is not at all a
bad sort of place. And yet showbusiness
is not grateful and demands more! Jesu,
Jesu, the days we have seen and
regretted! And all we have ever got
for our work is complaints from these
posturing mummers, these fiddlers with
little bits of celluloid, these mincing
stage 'managers that the critics don’t
praise them enough . . . the pathetic
befief that their trade is somehow more
exalted than that of the salesman of
encyclopedias or surgical appliances is
at the root of the trouble between them
and the critics.”

Music
Musicians know
what they like
By PAUL FROLICH
IN THE endeavor to become inde-
pendent of performers’ whims and
preferences, some modern composers
have finally turned to electronic
apparatus for the realisation of their
ideas; most of them, however, remain
at the mercy of practising musicians.
During the past week, I attended three
concerts in Sydney and was once again
struck by the fact that musicians tend
to do best with music they both under-
stand and like. By coincidence, the
week brought further evidence of the
high standards reached by some of the
local artists.
The first concert was a French
Recital staged by Project New Music.
It included Australian premieres of
ultra-modern piano works by Xenakis
and Boulez, neither of them very
meaningful for me nor, it seemed, for
the pianists involved. The evening’s
memorable event was Marilyn Richard-
son’s performance of Messiaen’s early
cycle “Songs of Earth and Heaven.”
Unlike much of the composer’s later
and highly problematical output, these
songs are inspired by simple emotions
and full of fine music; they are clearly
the kind of work a singer can really
enjoy doing, and Miss Richardson sang
them quite magnificently.
The second concert was a recital by
Rohan de Saram, a young cellist from
Ceylon touring for the ABC. Earnest,
absorbed, and unselfconscious, this
artist’s exploits were interesting rather
than convincing. His rough treatment
of his instrument reminded me of
Enrico Mainardi’s instruction to an
English student: “the cello, hug her,
you must love her”; this is certainly
not Mr. de Saram’s attitude! The rest of
the recital consisted of works by Bach,
Strauss, and Beethoven, and though
they all brought moments of consider-
able ' technical interest it was apparent
that none of the music had much
personal meaning for the artist as yet,
and I was constantly reminded of the
fact that we have better and more
mature cellists living right here.
The season’s first Youth Concert was
conducted by Sir Bernard Pleinze, with
the orchestra continuing to show much
of the polish acquired during Moshe
Atzmon’s visit. A Sinfonia by J. C.
(the “English”) Bach was not as lively
and delightful as it might have sounded,
but after this slight disappointment the
evening brought some remarkably fine
music, due mainly to the two soloists.
Geoffrey Michaels, a young violinist
from Perth, is on a visit from the
U.S.A., where he now lives. He is an
outstanding chamber musician, and
Prokofiev’s Ist violin concerto was a
happy choice for his talents.
The greatest pleasure of the evening
was furnished by contralto Lauris Elms,
one of our finest and most reliable
singers. With unfailingly accurate pitch
and a profound sense of understanding,
she gave one of the best performances
I’ve ever heard of Mahler’s “Songs
of the Wayfarer.”
Films
Man in space
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
2001: A Space Odyssey. Director,
Stanley Kubrick.
STANLEY KUBRICK’S Cinerama
space film is fascinating, baffling, and
exasperating. I came away from it
puzzled, provoked, with my eyes still
dazzled by its often unearthly beauty.
I certainly didn’t understand a lot of
what the director was aiming at —I
have a strong suspicion that Kubrick
himself wasn’t always quite sure —but I
wouldn’t have missed a moment of it.
Whatever you may make, if anything,
of Kubrick’s analysis of man and the
universe, the film is stunning both
visually and aurally, with a truly extra-
ordinary culminating sequence —a rush-
ing journey through swirling color and
shifting patterns; and there are other
sights and sounds that remain in the
memory—the astronaut tumbling with
eerie slowness through the illimitable
heavens, the computer singing itself into
silence after disconnection.
There is none of the usual plot
development. The film begins with a
sequence called “The Dawn of Man,”
when monkey-like creatures scratch for
food among sparse plants, intent on
nothing more than survival. One picks
up a dry bone and the anthropoids
awaken to its use as weapon and utensil.
Man is on his way to the future, when
complicated spacecraft swing through
the heavens to the accompaniment of a
luxuriously orchestrated version of
“The Blue Danube”—one of Kubrick’s
silliest indulgences.
With space travel almost a common-
place, man discovers an inexplicable
rectangular object, obviously not
natural in origin, buried on the moon.
This simple, enigmatic object domi-
nates the film as it offers incomprehen-
sible evidence of another intelligent
force in the universe. The important
things in the film are its looks and
sound; and though, in my ambivalent
feeling toward it, I sometimes wonder
if it was all a colossal take, I haven’t
been able to get it out of my mind
since I saw it.


Filming on

NORMAN LINDSAY says he is not
interested in the translation of his novel
“Age of Consent” into a wide-screen
color movie, but others see the pro-
duction as a major effort to re-establish
the Australian feature-film industry.
Budget for the film is $1 million, and
director Michael Powell is close to
bringing it in just under a 12-week
schedule. Location work on Dunk
Island, off the Queensland coast (where
the pictures on this page and the next
were taken), is finished, leaving only
interior scenes to be filmed in Sydney

Peter Yeldham’s screenplay has up-
dated Lindsay’s story of an artist who
loses enthusiasm for his work and goes
to a remote island in an effort to find
it again, but director Powell says the
film will “lose nothing of the original.”
James Mason is cast as the artist Brad-
ley Morahan; Helen Mirren, a 22-year-
old actress on leave from the Royal
Shakespeare Company, plays opposite
him as Cora, an ingenuous girl with
one of life’s classic roles. As with
his previous Australian production,
“They’re a Weird Mob,” Michael
Powell has cast most of the supporting
character parts from the Australian
directory; Neva Carr Glyn, Michael
Boddy, Slim de Grey, and Clarissa
Kaye are among a number who will be
featured.
Sydney painter and art teacher Paul
Delprat was contracted as the unit
artist to “ghost” James Mason’s art
work, much of which decorates the in-
terior of Morahan’s island shack.


BOOKS
Life in the devil’s kitchen
by MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
Lytton Strachey, the Years of Achieve-
ment 1910-1932. Michael Holroyd.
Heinemann. $9.80.
MR. HOLROYD’S second volume on
Lytton Strachey is even better than the
first; the two together, in my opinion,
constitute about the best literary
biography to appear for many a year.
I congratulate him heartily upon the
achievement.
Actually, the book is a. good deal
more than a biography, to which
Strachey’s thin life and meagre talent
would scarcely have stretched at such
a length. It is a meticulous and
fascinating study of a period, and of a
whole group of then distinguished indi-
viduals who set their stamp upon their
times, and whose influence, seeping
downwards, is decidedly noticeable even
today. As a group, and with notable
individual exceptions like Mr. Leonard
Woolf (who in any case, though he
associated closely with them, was never
in the truest sense of them), I find
them repellent, and feel for once in
full sympathy with D. H. Lawrence,
who, after lunching with a number of
them, let out a strangled cry: “You’re
doomed, doomed!”
Not that this is at all Mr. Holroyd’s
view. Like a good objective biographer
he contents himself with assembling the
data, and, by way of comment, indulges
only in an occasional ironical aside. I
like to imagine a faint scowl spreading
over his composed visage as he surveys
with his mind’s eye one of those grisly
Garsington assemblages presided over
by Lady Ottoline Morrell and graced
with his hero’s presence. But this may
be just wishful thinking on my part.
After going through all those boxes of
papers so conscientiously and assidu-
ously, reading all those anguished
homosexual love-letters, confronting all
that giggling donnish humor, maybe
even Garsington seems as tranquil as a
rectory garden on a summer afternoon.
For my part, I think of Garsington
as a sort of devil’s kitchen where many
of the follies and fantasies of the years
to come were being brewed—Keynes
with, as it were, affluence in his eyes
and inflation in his blood, he, the anti-
Marx and capitalism’s one and only
saviour; St. Aldous, the mescalin
Aquinas, the psychedelic father and
saint, providing post-humously the
name for many a blissful Californian
marihuana den; Lawrence himself, fret-
ting and fuming on the elegant lawns,
Mellors and Lady C. already forming
in the womb of time and soon to
venture forth, knocking like encyclo-
pedia salesmen at every suburban door.
They were all there, the shapers of our
world, including Lady Ottoline herself,
her face, as one of her more impish
lovers, Bertrand Russell, described it,
long and thin and something like a
horse, and her hair approximately the
color of marmalade, but rather darker.
Stimulated thereto by Mr. Holroyd,
I had a look at “Eminent Victorians”
after a lapse, it must be, of nearly half
a century. Oh, God! The sense of
desolation it gave me! What sniggering
affectation! What superficiality! Above
all, what emptiness! How could I, or
anyone else, I asked myself, have pos-
sibly supposed that these studies bore
any resemblance to the individuals they
purported to be about? And yet when
I first read the book I thought it the
quintessence of wit, subtlety, and per-
ceptiveness. So light and airy, so'
amusing, so pleasant a relief from the
solemn two- or three-decker biographies
to which one was accustomed. Now
I feel as though any Monypenny and
Buckle would be manna from heaven
compared with this dust.
Mr. Holroyd naturally takes a more
sanguine view of Strachey’s literary
gifts. Who could wade through that
mountain of paper about him and feel
otherwise? He considers that Strachey
and D. H. Lawrence represent a kind
of seesaw, with Dr. Leavis standing in
the middle as a controlling presence,
and that, when the present heavy tilt in
Lawrence’s favor is corrected, we shall
see Strachey rising high again.
It may be ?o, I suppose. In any
case, the fact that Strachey is so com-
pletely out of fashion makes Mr. Hol-
royd’s feat in sustaining interest in him
through two massive volumes all the
more remarkable. This he does by
dwelling on the sheer comedy, if not
farce, of Strachey’s life and associations,
and especially on his and his friends’
amorous proclivities. They were in and
out of one another’s arms and bed-
rooms as inconsequentially, and with
as little regard for the normal exits
and entrances, as characters in an Iris
Murdoch novel. Indeed—going back to
Mr. Holroyd’s seesaw for a moment —
it seems to me that Miss Murdoch
has managed to marry Laurentian
earnestness in these matters with
Stracheyesque sentimentality and flip-
pancy, producing a double-strength
brew that is all her own; a Bloody Iris,
as it were, compounded of Nottingham
laced with King’s.
In all the fun and games, the char-
acter of Carrington a weird art stu-
dent who fell in love with Strachey’s
beard and stayed with it through thick
and thin as portrayed by Mr. Hol-
royd is a comic masterpiece. The poor
lady took her own life when Strachey
died. She seems to have had more than
a touch of nymphomania on both sides
of the distaff; a Bloomsbury Dulcinea
del Toboso with her very un-parfit
knight.
What was it all but just a candle
guttering out history’s revenge for all
those Stracheys lying in Indian ceme-
teries; the end of a class. One might

take any number of incidents by way
of illustration. This will serve. Strachey
and Carrington with two friends, Nicho-
las and Barbara Bagenal, were on holi-
day in Wales; one highlight, Mr. Hol-
royd writes, “with a bottle of cham-
pagne. Nick withdrew the cork with a
pop —and Lytton, flinging his arms
wildly in the air, shrieked: ‘God! What
the war must be like!’ ” It was August
1916; they were far enough away not
to hear, as they might have done on
the South Coast, the rumble of guns
across the Channel, or even to fear the
visitation of a zeppelin.
Strachey’s poor health and conscien-
tious objections saved him from the holo-
caust which struck down so many of
his contemporaries. He lived on to
become famous, and to entertain us all
with his derisory contempt for the qual-
ities and values which had induced the
others to get themselves so pointlessly
killed. But time takes its revenge, and
it is difficult now not to feel in turn a
contempt for Strachey’s contempt; not to
see him as a sort of premature high-
table hipster; an honors school Allen
Ginsberg, with a clavichord instead of a
hand-held harmonium.
Unplumbed opiate
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Impact of Television. Methods
and Findings in Program Research.
William A. Belson. Cheshire. $6.75.
EVERY DAY, per medium of Aus-
tralia’s 50 commercial television chan-
nels, pearly-toothed persuaders insinu-
ate slogans into viewers’ minds as deftly
as Mr. Mikimoto implants irritants in
his oysters. To culture attitudes in
12,000,000 intelligences is an ex-
tremely expensive business. It is a
cheap television commercial that costs
less than $4OOO to product, while some
of the more luscious pieces of imagery
have set their sponsor back a cool
$30,000 second for second, a budget
of Dino de Laurentiis magnitude. Yet
even this expenditure is petty cash be-
side the price of television time. A
modest schedule of 50 screenings per
capital city \yon’t leave much change
from SIOO,OOO.
So advertisers have learned that it
makes good sense to invest a few thous-
ands in research to establish “bench-
marks” and assess “attitude change.”
It is seen as cheap insurance, and many
of Australia’s social psychologists are
involved in electronic augery in the ser-
vice of Mammon.
So we have the paradoxical situation
that while commercials take up about
13 percent of transmission time, the
overwhelming volume of qualitative re-
search is concentrated on them, while
the influence of program material re-
mains almost entirely a matter of con-
jecture. It seems that the amount of
worthwhile academic research into the
effects of television on the community
could be printed on the head of a
transistor.
Under the direction of the enthusi-
astic Ray Newell, the ABC has made
some ingenious but fairly tentative
studies of program-interest groupings,
viewer involvement versus ratings, and
the correlation of viewing and reading
habits. Adelaide University’s Dr. Lovi-
bond has completed a painstaking study
of schoolboy viewers which suggests
that their TV diet predisposes them to
Fascism. David Martin has done some
interesting work for the Melbourne
University, analysing program content.
But really significant papers are few
and far between, and William Belson,
long a member of the BBC’s Audience
Research Department, suggests that the
reason involves questions of professional
status. TV research, it seems, lacks the
aura of academic respectability.
In “The Impact of Television,” Bel-
son sets out to demonstrate the value
of research to the program-makers. In
the book’s first section he reprints ques-
tionnaires used to determine public atti-
tudes to the themes of proposed BBC
series. One was to be “Britain in De-
cline,” and the research study was to
establish the degree of viewer aware-
ness in the subject so that the producer
could pitch the program at the most
meaningful level. Similarly, attitudes to
mental illness and Anglo-American re-
lationships were tested, to help in the
preparation of scripts. The second
section deals with the viewers’ subse-
quent comprehension of resulting pro-
grams, while the third attempts to
isolate any subsequent change of com-
munity attitude or opinion.
Throughout the book, Belson is con-
cerned at the hostility felt toward his
work by the creative writer and pro-
ducer who clearly view the re-
searcher as a new and more abhorrent
form of the bureaucrat and censor. Bel-
son is at great pains to deny this,
arguing that one of the roles of re-
search is to bring about a new con-
sciousness in industry management, so
that qualitative considerations will have
a better chance of surviving quantitative
pressures. In fact, it is hard to see why
any creative person should be intimi-
dated by Belson’s ideas, which tend to
be tediously expressed, while his docu-
ments, as is often the case with research,
take an interminable time to prove the
obvious. However, the third section
of the book, which deals with TV’s
social impact—on cinema, reading,
sociability and “viewer initiative”—
is far livelier and full of valuable
findings.
One closes the book with respect
for Belson’s viewpoints and a feeling
of panic that, after 12 years of tele-
vision in this country, we’ve done
so little to assess its impact. When the
drug thalidomide misbehaved, the re-
sults were all too clear and obvious.
Limbs were deformed and distorted,
and quick action was taken. Yet TV,
the most widely indulged opiate in his-
tory, may well be deforming countless
minds, and we simply wouldn’t know.

Windus-The Hogarth Press. $2.85.
IT’S A PITY that most of the 23
authors in the attractively produced
Phoenix Living Poets series are either
drearily or pretentiously second-rate,
giving the impression that the pub-
lishers’ editors have been mainly
guided by past and present superfici-
alities of fashion. However, whether
accidentally or by design, the series
does include at least five good poets —
three of them Americans. Adrienne
Rich is one of the most distinguished
of the younger American poets.
She has chosen forty poems from
her previous four books for this selec-
tion, more than half of them from her
most recent American volume. She
hasn’t taken many from her first, pub-
lished in 1951, but enough to show
that she began with a kind of modest
elegance and a mild metaphysical irony
inherited from the Fugitives’ more
forceful store. The deft, smooth crafts-
manship of these earlier poems in-
terestingly recalls Chris Wallace-
Crabbe’s (I’m not suggesting that
either poet influenced the other, though
a common influence could be argued).
There’s little of this Australian’s wit
and nothing of his occasional intensity
in her earlier poetry.
But after a few years Adrienne Rich
generally gets right away from the
refinements of traditional poetic tech-
nique. Possibly, she was influenced by
Denise Levertov —to whom a poem near
the end of her transitional period is
dedicated—or possibly, Miss Rich, too,
was directly affected by William Car-
los Williams’ example. Her work, any-
way, becomes “freer” (more flexible
and alive), subject to sudden-illumin-
ations, to unexpected, exciting but
accurate imagery and turns of phrase:
paradoxically, it’s still disciplined
(though the discipline’s different). It’s


now a specifically American poetry,
not just geographically and certainly
not for patriotic reasons. Her poetry
differs from Denise Levertov’s, in that,
frequently, a traditional metre is
implied. This very valid poetic form
enables her to deal truly and appro-
priately with the everyday material of
experience.
In the half-dozen of Adrienne Rich’s
early poems, we find the seemingly
neo-classic approach which was to
become so fashionable in the mid-’fifties,
and the imagery tends to be generalised:
reflected in the evenly flowing surface
of the verse,, things appear at one
remove. The newer work locates her
spirit and personality “poetically and
experientally,” becomes much more
directly perceptual and sensory show-
ing her pleasure at the way things look
and feel, a concern for minuteness as
well as size: “Skin of wet leaves on
asphalt,” “the crystal grit of flying
snow,” “this water-drop bulging at the
taphead,// forced by dynamos three
hundred miles/ . . ./ for three seconds
of quivering identity” (from “Autumn
Sequence”). This crystalline intensity
can combine with color, a sense of tex-
ture, a tactile quality, as in “Open-Air
Museum”:
Blue sparks of the chicory-flower
flash from the embers of the dump
inside the rose-rust carcass of a
slaughtered Chevrolet.
Ller range of situations and settings
is wide: breakfast in a Utica, N.Y.,
bowling alley, a couple sitting upright
and silent in a parked car, a cemetery,
a dump, a farm, a city square, to in-
stance just six. She writes of both love
and lust honestly and lyrically in “Two
Songs.” “Peace” superbly describes a
storm and its aftermath when a “rain-
bow/breaks out its enormous flag—/
oily, unnegotiable—/ over the sack-
draped backs/ of the cattle ...” I
should mention “The Trees,” a strange
and excellent poem, the startling little
“Noon,” and particularly “Not Like
That,” a sensitive, image-filled examina-
tion of the finality of death.
SONG
Shaken by this and that,
anybody’s reed,
what I expect is wind.
A hungry man grows fat
To satisfy his need.
It’s all in the mind.
Poised in a windless calm,
I’m subject to doubt:
can it, or should it, last?
Nobody prays for harm,
to be without,
just to confirm the past.
What renewal is there?
The exchange of words.
Language is what we share,
and with that, this.
In sheer silence, one
is perfectly alone
and cloudy and remiss,
strictly for the birds.

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Survival
techniques for
starving bachelors
STRANGE TO RELATE, many of my
lone male acquaintances love food but
can barely boil an egg. Those who don’t
rush off and marry the nearest good
cook (because they can’t stand another
restaurant meal) continue to suffer in
silence, scraping by with the odd steak
at home, a handy can-opener, and the
good auspices of their married friends.
(Sometimes they return the compliment
by shouting an expensive dinner in a
good restaurant!)
Personally, nothing gives me greater
pleasure than to fatten up a starving
guest. They are, after all, so apprecia-
tive. But at the same time I am given
to lecturing. Restaurant food is expensive
especially when it becomes a daily
habit. All that beautiful money could be
saved and used to buy something more
lasting than a good meal.
There are ways to overcome the
absence of a built-in little woman. But
it does take planning. Presuming you
are one of these lads, start by looking
at your diary on a Saturday morning.
While sipping the Alka-Seltzer, pencil
poised, decide which meals are going
to be had at home on definite dates.
Having decided how many meals
you’re likely to be home for alone,
or with a friend make a list accord-
ingly. Steak seems to be a standby for
everyone; it’s easy to cook in a variety
of ways. Consider lamb chops for a
change. Chicken livers can be bought
frozen and stored in the freezer. Chic-
ken pieces come in similar packets. (In
my columns, from time to you’ll
find recipes which are geared to cooking
for one or two. Practise them on
yourself for the first time!)
Try a steak au poivre. Don’t cook it
if you really can’t stand lots of black
pepper; however, what threatens to be
too hot for comfort strangely enough is
not hot but piquant when cooked.
Before you leave for the office in the
morning, remove your steak from the re-
frigerator and leave, uncovered (unless
you own a hungry cat), to warm up.
A good steak is never one that is cooked
while still chilled.
On arriving home, cover the steak
with a lot of coarsely ground black
pepper. If your pepper mill is not cap-
able of coarse grinding, then place some
peppercorns in a bag and whack the
daylights out of them with the end of
a bottle. Embed the cracked peppers in
the steak with your hand. Leave for
20 minutes or more.
Toss a watercress salad and heat the
hotplate. When everything is ready,
place a little butter in a frying pan and
brown your steak on both sides. Add a
glass of red wine to the pan and wait
for the liquid to reduce to half. Lower
the flame, stir in two tablespoons of
cream per steak, and serve, when
blended, with the remaining wine. The
cooking time is less than six minutes.
Try lamb chops cooked en casserole.
Again, remove meat from refrigerator on
leaving for work in the morning. On
return fry a large sliced onion in some
butter. Add a couple of sliced mush-
rooms when the onion is golden. (Both
onions and mushrooms can also be-
bought dried, so there is no excuse for
not having them in the larder all the
time.) Add the chops and lightly brown
on both sides. Dissolve a chicken stock
cube in J pint of hot water, add 2
tablespoons of blackcurrant jam and a
dash of Maggi seasoning, or soy sauce.
Transfer the chops into a covered cas-
serole, cover with the prepared liquid,
and cook for 30 minutes (375 deg.)
while you get ready for the evening.
Delicious with rice (12 minutes to
cook).
If it’s chicken you fancy, defrost the
pieces the night before. In the morn-
ing, before you go to work, chop the
meaty parts into approximately 2in.
pieces and marinate in the following
mixture: 1 grated onion, 2 tablespoons
of oil, the juice of 1 lemon, \ teaspoon
of tarragon, \ teaspoon of rosemary,
salt and pepper, and a crushed bay-
leaf and garlic clove. Toss and leave.
Toss again when you get home. Heat
the oven on arrival (450 deg.), scrub a
large potato, and stick it on the oven
shelf for an hour. Then heat about
two inches of oil in a skillet (a deep
frying pan). When it’s bubbling, cook
your chicken pieces until crisp and'
“blot” them on kitchen paper before
transferring to your plate. Cut your
potato in half, top with sour cream and
chopped chives, or just a good dollop
of butter. A side salad is never a mis-
take, and with a good piece of cheese
what could be more delicious?
When you have a craving for pork,
try the following recipe. Trim excess
fat from 1 or 2 pork chops and blanch
them in boiling water for a minute or
two. Drain well and dry. DuSt with
flour lightly and saute in a frying pan,
in a mixture of butter and oil, until
golden on both sides. Season to taste.
Add two finely chopped shallots and a
medium-sized apple, peeled and sliced.
When browned, add 1 glass of white
wine and simmer until tender. Sprinkle
with finely chopped parsley, if you have
any, and devour. (Fry some cold sliced
potato with a chopped onion in a little
butter or olive oil.)
If you need a starter, stick to the
simple things. A good pate served with
piping-hot toast and some crisp radishes
is still one of the finest overtures. We’ll
make a good cook of you yet!

Protected kangaroos
Peter Samuel’s otherwise excellent
article “Conservation: The Middle
Way” contains the statement that
“Preservationists ... . want the kangaroo
proclaimed a protected animal . .
All too few people seem to realise that
in N.S.W. the kangaroo, both red and
grey, is a protected animal under the
Fauna Protection Act, and that taking
or killing one can bring a maximum
fine of $lOO. Kangaroos may only be
taken under licence from the National
Parks and Wildlife Service, and licences
are only granted to landholders who
can prove that the animals are caus-
ing them financial loss. This, of course,
does not mean that unlicensed shoot-
ing does not take place; it will continue
until more men are available to enforce
the Act and until the provisions of the
Act are more .yfidely known. But the
majority of commercial kangaroo-
shooting is carried out on the properties
of farmers who have licences to reduce
their pest-level kangaroo populations.
This is the apparently “uncontrolled”
slaughter which will only be reduced
when, as your article says, the kangaroo
comes to be regarded as an economic
asset father than as a pest.

Australia's role
Having lived in South-East Asia for the
past two years I would commend
Donald Horne’s comment (8., April 13)
as the best article I have read on Aus-
tralia and South-East Asia and the
part Australia should play here. It not
only offers solutions, ideas, suggestions,
but it is a stirring and inspiring piece
of writing of which we should have
more and more, if people are to be in-
formed and shaken out of their state
of euphoria. Donald Horne writes:
“What seems hardest for Australians to
imagine is that we are neither a gallant
little ally, nor a beleaguered island, but
a power of credible military strength
playing a role in its own region. Yet
this would seem the role we should
most prepare ourselves for.”
We can have power and militate
strength, a state of preparedness, with-
out appearing aggressive. We can give
economic assistance and military train-
ing to our neighbors as a gesture of
goodwill and friendship. We can
“respond to initiatives as they arise.”
Whilst doing this, let us not lose our
identity as a separate country, a con-
tinent, not just another Asian island.
We are not asking, cap in hand, to be
admitted to the Asian brotherhood of
nations! We are and forever will be, a
country in the Asian region, ready to
shoulder our share of the burdens.

British "betrayal"
In Harvey Stockwin’s series of articles
commencing with “The British Way of
Betrayal” (8., January 27 issue), he
appears to be so biased as to have lost
sight of all else except the sins of the
British in relation to their east of Suez
policy. He neglects such aspects as the
ignoring by Australia of repeated
requests by Britain for increased assist-
ance in the Malayan area, the financial
mess Britain was getting into by, com-
pared with Australia, spending three
times as much of her revenue on mili-
tary commitments, and the reluctance
with which this country tendered its
limited contribution as though we were
doing Britain and Malaya a great
favor.
As recently as half a dozen years ago
the Australian public would have been
highly indignant had it been asked to
put its hand in its collective purse to
finance defence. Recruiting for the
armed services was something not to be
even considered: let the British or the
Americans or somebody do the job
was the attitude.
In my opinion one of the best things
that could have happened to Australia
is the “shock treatment” we have
recently been receiving, first from
Britain, then from the U.S. It provides
the-means of challenge to develop our
own foreign policy, to enter into
regional arrangements of our own
choice, and to emerge into individual
nationhood.

Praising wowsers
How cynical and supercilious is your
contributor Batman. He never seems
to miss an opportunity of slanging the
alleged wowser and this person is
usually also a Sabbatarian. I suggest
it is a good thing there is still a section
of people who share a national concern
that Australia has among the highest
incidence of alcoholism, and this only
assesses those registered as such: or
that N.S.W. has earned the dubious
title of the gambling State. I submit
that, by and large, the total abstainer
is a better driver, less accident-prone,
and therefore contributing less to
national distress and calamity, even if
also less' to national tax. As for sabbath
observance and attendance at the
church of one’s choice, I think it would
be a soulless society that gave no
acknowledgement to the God of
creation on the one day in seven.
