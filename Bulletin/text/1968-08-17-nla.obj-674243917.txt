A new word in shipping
a new means of moving
bulk cargoes quickly
and efficiently
080 is a word coined from Oil/Bulk/Ore, the cargoes carried by a
new breed of ship plying the trade routes.
Associated Bulk Carriers Limited, in which P & 0 has a 50 per
cent share, operates five of these giant bulk carriers of up to
75,000 d.w.t. They are specially designed to convert to carrying
coal, ore, grain or liquids such as crude oil.
ABC bulk carriers already have lifted the first loads of Australian
iron ore to smelters in Europe.
Fast turnaround at each end of the voyage and low cost per
ton/mile make the 11,500 mile haul by bulk carrier to Europe an
economic one. The pattern and tempo of development in these
times of great change and new technologies fathered the bulk
carrier an' l the 080.

One more week
BLEEDING HEART
THE blood market had another of its
seasonal instabilities in Sydney last
week. With stocks at critically low levels
and the suspension of surgical opera-
tions threatened, the Red Cross Blood
Bank sent out one of its urgent appeals
for donors that are the one-edition
delight of the afternoon papers
(“CRISIS IN HOSPITALS,” “WILL
YOU SAVE A LIFE?”).
Momentarily, it was a “sellers’ mar-
ket,” but by late afternoon the Blood
Bank was in the red again, and donors
were cooling their heels for up to two
hours, in the long queue, to give a pint.
By 6 p.m. the Bank was picking and
choosing. A colleague of ours, willing
to bleed a jar of his comparatively rare
B-RH negative, was snapped at by a
harassed Blood Bank telephonist and
told, “No thanks. We don’t want any
of yours.” It made him feel as outdated
and unwanted as a string tie.
LONG-TERM PROSPECTS
THE RESPONSE of individual Aus-
tralian Catholics to Pope Paul’s encyc-
lical on contraception must have sur-
prised more of the liberals among them
than the conservatives. Many of the
liberals may have felt for the first time
that they aren’t an insignificant min-
ority.
Although, of course, there may be
many Catholics pragmatically broad-
minded on a subject like birth control
but much less inclined to change in
other directions; it is possible to think
of Catholics on the Pill who really do
prefer the Mass in Latin.
Discussion on the subject has prob-
ably hardly begun, and Catholics, not
the most reluctant minority to air their
differences in public, will be hard at it
in letter-columns for weeks, or months,
to come.
However, how many Catholics are
prepared to ignore the encyclical can-
not be judged now; perhaps it can in a
decade or so by counting the size of
families going to Mass.
In the Australian context, it is hard
to see why bishops should be so sur-
prised at Catholics putting their own
encyclical when they feel they “cannot
afford” more children. The hierarchy
seems consistently to have put its own
interpretation on the encyclical on
social justice when it comes to payment
of lay-teachers in its schools (a matter
on which industrial action is now plan-
ned), because the Church feels it “can’t
afford” to pay what State schools do.
There is the added point here that if
enough Catholics ignore the new encyc-
lical, it will in time solve the whole
problem of overcrowded Catholic
schools for the bishops.
PHRASEMAKING
WE WERE picking our way carefully
through a recent interview with British
playwright John. Osborne by critic
Kenneth Tynan, when we were arrested
by the following exchange:
Tynan: I recently decided that what
attracts me most in art and life is high-
definition performance. Do you agree?
Osborne: Absolutely.
A few pages later in the same news-
paper Tynan was chatting on about the
“very ecstasy of High Definition Per-
formance.”
We felt that for once we had been
there when a phrase was made. We
feel high-definition performance is sure
to be tossed from one critic’s ink-
stained hand to the next, and we would
be prepared to bet that you will first
find it in print in the Saturday pages
of “The Australian.”
SNAPPED UP
REDMOND PHILLIPS is one of the
long-time expatriates to whom word
has now filtered through that “things
are better here now” and who have
come back to find out for themselves;
like many expatriate Australians, he is
actually a New Zealander.
For the past 20 years Phillips has
enjoyed an extremely diverse and suc-
cessful career on the stage, in films, and
TV in England. “Things in England
aren’t as buoyant,” he said. “There is
a bit of a recession. I had gone into
the possibility of TV work in New
Zealand which seemed promising.”
As it turned out, he could only have
a short holiday with his sister in New
Zealand; when the ship was two days
out of Fremantle he was offered TV
work in Australia, and in the space
of three weeks was acting in “Contra-
bandits” and “My Name’s McGooley.”
“I was won over completely,” die said.
Redmond Phillips rehearsing “The
Dragon, the Donkey, and the Night-
ingale” with Anna Bowden for the Aus-
tralian Theatre for Young People
“You don’t hear of all the things that
are going on here, unless you keep up
regular correspondence from London,
but it all seems marvellous.”
At the moment he is back on the
stage as lead actor rehearsing for the
new season of the Australian Theatre
for Young People. Although he doesn’t
think he can be too definite about being
back permanently for at least a year,
he has bought a home unit and un-
packed his antique collection, which he
shipped out from England.
“The climate, of course, appeals,” he
said, “although there’s not a variety of
outdoor life that I remember. There is
no hope of enjoying a picnic at French’s
Forest any more; it’s all suburbanised.”
He agrees prosperity has its compen-
sations, but blames it for spoiling the
old beauty and making Australia so
bldnd.
Of all the odd experiences he has
had during his years in the theatre, the
one Mr. Phillips remembers most
vividly was caused by an English fog.
His first really big casting in England
was as Brabantio in “Othello” at the
Nottingham Playhouse. On the first
night he left his lodgings, just up the
hill from the theatre, at four in the
afternoon. A thick brown fog was
hovering over the Trent valley and he
couldn’t see anything except the bright
foglights of the lorries, which kept
veering off the road toward where he
was inching sideways down the foot-
path using paling-fences as his guide.
After three-quarters of an hour he
arrived at the theatre, miraculously
unscathed.
But when the curtain rose on the
play and lago summoned him on to the
balcony, he swears he couldn’t find his
position for the pall of fog that had
seeped into the theatre.
To Mr. Phillips the greatest thrill in
the world was playing Leonato in
“Much Ado About Nothing” at
Stratford-on-Avon. “It was exhilirat-
ing and inspiring; 'you really feel this is
what it is all about,” he said. But he
has acted in The Old Vic, Oxford,
Bristol, Birmingham, and Coventry as
well as in London’s West End. His
greatest success he feels was in “The
Potting Shed” (“the reviews were
terrific”) at the Globe Theatre in 1958
with Sir John Gielgud and Irene Worth.
He has worked with Dame Edith
Evans, Christopher Plummer, Richard
Burton (in the film “Becket”), Albert
Finney (in “Tom Jomes”), Tom Cour-
tenay, and Vanessa Redgrave.
He paints a true-to-film-character
picture of Sean Connery “before he
had done much.” When they were act-
ing together in Oxford, Connery used
to give him a lift to London every
Saturday night. “Those trips were the
most terrifying experiences of my life.
That wild young chap raced his
Lagonda, I think it was, the 50-odd
miles in one hour flat—l don’t think
that has been done before or since—
with a stream of abuse pouring out all
the way.” Mr. Phillips remains very
grateful that “Connery bore a charmed
life.”

A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF LUXURY
The Brougham Philosophy is a very simple one: limousine luxury
that will put many a high-priced import to shame. The result, a car
that is noticeably longer, dramatically more beautiful . . . with
an attention to detail that lacks nothing for your comfort,
and pleasure. Standard equipment includes sumptuous brocade
upholstery, power-assisted front brakes, power steering and
the whispering smoothness of a 5-litre, 210 horsepower VB. And,
of course, the complete GMH safety package, including the energy
absorbing steering column. What it all adds up to is more than
just a luxury car; it is a totally new philosophy of what luxury
in this price range should be. The Brougham Philosophy.

MUCH DIVING AT CAMDEN
“IT’S THE SECOND jump that’s the
hard one.” Peter Fricke, secretary of
the Australian Parachutists’ Federation,
instructor for the Pacific School of
Parachuting, and a foundation member
of the Sydney Sky Divers, looked
severely at a group of trainees prac-
tising falling about on a green slope
at Camden, south of Sydney. “And only
one in ten stays long enough to do it.
For the first jump they’ve had all this
training—we try to build up their con-
fidence sol that they can step out into
space-—but after they’ve done it once
they know what to expect, and then it
takes courage.”
About 200 prospective skydivers
arrive at Camden each weekend, both
the old initiates who save every penny
to get their full complement of jumps
and the newcomers to the sport who
join up with the school and begin to
study the principles of the business.
Part of the course includes being
pulled across the grass behind a car
to get the idea of holding on to a
recalcitrant parachute, and much of it
involves jumping off fences and rolling
about in the required attitudes. One-
third of the trainees these days are
women, though, with a few notable
exceptions, after half a dozen jumps
women are inclined to feel that it’s
just one long step after another and
go back to tennis.
It doesn’t cost a great deal to jump
—between two and three dollars each
time—but equipment is fairly expen-
sive. A parachute costs from $70 to
$100 and a reserve chute another $50;
this is the bare minimum ex-Army
type of equipment. The really splendid
chutes from France and the United
States can cost an enthusiastic jumper
up to $1000.
Parachutists come from every kind
of background. Girls who work in
factories jump; bus drivers jump;
middle-aged women with several
children (perhaps predictably) jump;
typists and laborers jump; printers,
doctors, and photographers jump; milk-
men miss their sleep to jump. They
all pack their chutes with infinite care,
pile five at a time in a Cessna plane,
climb to 8000 feet above the spires of
Camden, step out of the open door,
hanging precariously by the struts for a
moment before plunging down.
For 52 seconds they fall through the
air at 120 mph, though during this
phase they have no sensation of falling.
Then with any luck they press the
right button or pull the right lever,
feel the hearty tug as the parachute
flies out behind them, and float down
at a mere 30 mph to land, stumbling
and rolling about among the cow-dung
of Camden.
Lying about in the landing field are
the enthusiasts who race back and
forth to Camden airport to ferry their
friends to the Cessna and rush back to
await their coming. Without this con-
stant movement of cars much of the
excitement at Camden might diminish.
All weekend the skydivers and their
friends risk permanently cricked necks
looking into the sun —beginning at first
light in the morning and ending in the
golden afternoon. At night the hardier
ones sleep in sleeping-bags in the
hangar or camp by the creek. The
others stay in the town, but no one who
can stay thinks of going home.
Most of them have graduated from
other highly individual sports — from
skiing on water and snow, from skin-
diving and wrestling, cliffdiving,
mountaineering, and all the kindred
skills which test the physical co-
ordination of the player to the fine
point of destruction.
LOOKING BACK
A SURPRISINGLY formidable list of
private collectors have lent paintings
to the Newcastle City Art Gallery for
its retrospective exhibition of the work
of the somewhat neglected Australian
painter Rupert Bunny.
David Thomas, the director of the
Gallery, has been assembling the
paintings, 66 in all, for the past six
months, and has received contributions
from collectors in Sydney, Melbourne,
and Brisbane, in addition to paintings
lent by the three State galleries of
N.S.W., Victoria, and Queensland.
Lady Casey, wife of the Governor-
General, has lent “The Letter,”
believed to be a portrait of Henry Han-
del Richardson", and Miss Lucy Swan-
ton, a former director of the Macquarie
Galleries in Sydney and one of Bunny’s
staunchest admirers, has contributed six.
“I think we had ten Bunny shows at
the Macquarie,” she says, “and every

time we had a show I’d buy one paint-
ing.
“I first saw his work in Melbourne
in about 1927—and it was his lyricism
that I liked. But he’s still neglected by
private collectors in Australia.”
Thomas regards Bunny, a contem-
porary of Arthur Streeton’s, as a major
Australian artist and believes he hasn’t
achieved wide recognition in this coun-
try because his subjects, in the main,
were not Australian. “They weren’t
tuned to the pioneering spirit, and, of
course, Australian art has always been
very nationalistic. Up until now I
don’t think we’ve been sophisticated
enough to enjoy Bunny’s kind of art.
“He painted mostly in France, and
one painting, Summertime, which we
acquired in 1962, is like a Renoir,
although more conservative perhaps.
“There may be few Bunny collectors,
but the ones there are are devotees,
with 10 or 12 of his paintings in their
collections.”

THE WHOLE PLACE
REEKS WITH
ATMOSPHERE
AS YOU MUST KNOW, atmosphere
is terribly, terribly in. Even as recently
as four years ago, if you had possessed
the wit to realise that atmosphere was
about to take over, you would have
made a fortune. The thing to do would
have been to collect every piece of
Victoriana in sight, marble fireplaces,
kerosine lamps, marble busts, stained
glass, even frightful pictures of the
International Order of Rechabites
cricket team, 1890. They are all price-
less.
Atmosphere is utterly essential right
now, and the way pubs and new
restaurants are trying to out-atmosphere
each other in Melbourne is downright
fascinating. Last week we had the
opening of the Lazar restaurant in Little
Bourke Street by Dame Zara Holt at
a special breakfast. And that’s another
thing. Opening breakfasts are all the
rage. Your correspondent has had five
in the past fortnight, and it makes a
terribly long champagne day. One
remembers an old Air Force instruction,
“there shouldn’t be any more breakfast
than a cup of black coffee and a long,
slow, look around.”
For breakfast at Lazar’s we had
oysters, smoked salmon, and champagne.
Tom Lazar, of the Little Reata restaur-
ant, is the owner, and Dame Zara’s son
Sam Holt also has a share in it.
The Lazar creaks with atmosphere.
Inside it looks, well, almost like a
medieval torture-chamber with great
arches made from antique sand-blasted
bricks. There are two fires in cauldron-
like iron dishes hanging from the ceil-
ing by anchor-chains. Ah, but the
atmosphere bits . . . They have the dear
old bar from the now-wrecked Treasury
Hotel, the superb cast-bronze balcony
railing from the now-wrecked Colonial
Mutual Building, and, you know the
old hotel dining-room doors? The type
with dining-room sandblasted on the
glass in a gorgeous design? They have
a pair of those. There are marble busts,
there are magnificently ghastly mid-
Victorian pictures of fat girls in their
nighties floating through clouds, and as
you enter the door there is a plaster
statue of the “Marriage of Venus” just
like those in the Ballarat Gardens. You
will remember the one. She is starkers
except that she is holding in one hand
a piece of cloth over her most censor-
able equipment, while her other hand
is clutched over her bare bosom. She
is looking toward the door just as if
she has been frightened by the friendly
Electrolux man.
The windows are quite cathedral-like
with lovely stained glass, but the decor
which is particularly intriguing is the
timbering. It is all ribbed, high up, and
looks very Robin Boyd. Actually, the
effect comes from* genuine antique sheep
ramps, taken from old cattle trucks.
But, you understand, in this case the
atmosphere is beautifully fumigated.
Also in the atmosphere stakes we
have Cliveden. You will remember, per-
haps, on October 14, 1967, this page
reported, tearfully, that Cliveden
Mansions, the vast town house built
by Sir William Clarke, Bart., grand-
father of Sir Rupert, had gone under
the hammer. Cliveden was meant to be
a thing of glory, like Lord Astor’s
Cliveden, and so it was. This week
Whelan the Wrecker is in full cry, put-
ting on the best show in town. He has
the crane and ball in action, and it has
been reported that on Saturday after-
noons the spectacle of the crumbling
Cliveden has been a better show than
the footy at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground over the road.
In 1887 Cliveden, in Wellington
Parade, had practically the best site in
town. It still has, and the U.S. Dilling-
ham Corporation is using it to build
the Cliveden Hotel, which should be
the best this city has seen, and 19 to 21
storeys high. We noted, after the auc-
tion, all the best Cliveden bits, the
stained glass, the priceless Italian fire-
place in carved marble, the oak panel-
ling, the chandeliers, the Italian stair-
case in carved oak, all went off in num-
bered boxes. Tom Ellis, project man-
ager of Dillingham, says sure thing,
they have all those pieces still, and he
is hoping to put them all into the new
building. For example, he sees an inti-
mate bar warmed by a real fire, lit in
the most exquisite of the fireplaces.
He hasn’t quite decided where he can
put all the Italian glass. One remem-
bers a superb stretch of stained glass
by the first-floor landing. It depicted a
robust, plump Renaissance blonde, suit-
ably surrounded by servants, plus the
message: “Thou art as welcome as the
flowers in May. None come too early,
none too late return.” He will have to
find a place for that, right in the main
lobby. It will be such a comfort to the
poor characters who can’t pay their bill.
Yet, the real atmosphere ultimate will
be Le Chateau restaurant, due to open
in Queens Road in three or four weeks.
The man behind it is Louis Fleyfel, 40,
who came here from Beirut, Lebanon,
when he was 19. He started work in a
factory, saved up to pay a deposit to
buy a milk-bar in Geelong. Before long
he had a great many milk bars and,
more recently, an interest in the Walnut
Tree restaurant.
Louis Fleyfel came into the news, for
the first time with real dash, last
March. The treasures of Homeden, the
great old Toorak mansion of the Nicho-
las family, were up for sale. Louis
Fleyfel paid $4500 for the great
mahogany staircase and panelling,
$l5O for the brocade curtain, $525 for
the stained-glass ceiling lights, $240 for
the grandfather clock, and so on.
You’ve guessed it; all this material will
be in Le Chateau.
The Brockhoff family used to live in
a very large two-storey house opposite
Albert Park. Louis Fleyfel tore down
everything but the facade and built his
chateau on behind. He is spending
$500,000. You should see inside. It is a
cross between Homeden and the Palace
of Versailles. The floor has a circle of
lovely green marble, surrounded by
white marble with a blue vein, all
Italian. He has french windows,
carved balustrades, and lonic columns.
He plans to fill two floors with some-
thing like $20,000 worth of furniture.
Indeed, he admits it will be an expen-
sive place at which to eat. He insists
that it will be far and away the best
restaurant in Australia.
As your correspondent spoke to him
in his air-conditioned, telephone-
equipped Mercedes sports, he tried to
think of a restaurant in the world that
could be better, and, no, he couldn’t.
“It’s the latest building trend .. .and
it keeps the National Trust happy”

Currently Kalcolor aluminium is
being used on most of the important
building projects in Australia. It is
transforming the Australian scene
with colour. From shop fronts to
window walls, from sunscreens to
interior finishings.
No other hard-coat process can
match the valuable years of
experience that Kalcolor aluminium
has gained under Australian
conditions.
And none is so resistant to fading,
abrasion and corrosion, ensuring
lasting colour in all climates. There’s
freedom of design too, as Kalcolor
aluminium can be supplied in a
variety of forms, exactly to your
specification.
Kalcolor aluminium is available
in Gold, Light Bronze, Bronze,
Statuary Bronze, Grey and Black,

CAMDEN PASSAGE
BY TEATIME Billie has a nasty
suspicion inside that black-and-white
reversible cloak of hers that trade’s not
gonna be so good today. By six o’clock
hers is the last stall open at Camden
Passage antique market, Islington, and
her mood is sour. Jimmie, who sells
gas-taps mounted on pegboard for 255.
and up, consoles her with a never mind,
ducks, it’ll be better next Saturday.
Stuff, says Billie, wrapping trinkets into
old newspapers and shoving them into
carrier bags for the long trek home to
Totteridge, it bleedin’ well won’t. But
don’t let on she said that: she might
get thrown out.
The thing is, Camden Passage is so
absolutely in these days that everyone’s
queuing for stalls and shops. Seven
years ago the local council decided to
pull it down and build a supermarket.
Then some character with a talent for
publicity creates an Islington set, men-
tioning en passant that the local nobs
of Canonbury are disgusted at this pil-
lage of historical beauty and all that.
The story catches the last edition of
the last copy of the “News Chronicle”
before it folds. This catches the eye of
television and it snowballs from there.
Islington is the new place to live.
Property values zoom. The Passage
becomes an antique market and, ye
gods, everyone is coming to see what’s
going on. Half the royal family in
disguise, that is, headscarves and gum-
boots, American tycoons, politicians,
actors, and “Vogue” takes fashion pic-
tures against Fred Slapp’s grocer’s
shop. The Passage becomes a company,
and shareholders get 100 percent divi-

Now restaurateur Robert Carrier is

out for a fantastic £lO,OOO. H. M.
Repuke, the undertaker’s, is now Mr.
Carson’s Antiques, he managed to get
over the creepy feeling those coffins
gave him. Maxwell Joseph, the hotel
magnate, has bought the Camden Head
pub, scene of murder and rape, due to
reopen any day now. Lou’s, the only
place in London with second-hand
single socks for sale, sells out for £6500.
She could’ve got another £2OOO. Aw,
hell, says Lou, what’s a couple of thou’
to her? So everyone’s doing well these
days. And after seven years the place
is unrecognisable. There is not, for a
start, quite the same . . . trust that
once existed.

And farther up, where the Cypriot’s

from Christian Sell’s modern box-

the hell it’s all about. He is sending, by

Saturday in Camden Passage, like
Saturday in Carnaby Street and Satur-
day in Portobello Market and Saturday
in King’s Road, Chelsea, is choked
with people who’ve come to look.
Arnold, who writes I-spy stories for
kiddies and sits in a wigwam on week-
days with an Indian headdress on, is
walking down with his secret stock-
book and price-list clutched to his chest.
He thinks Saturday shoppers are
ghastly. He catches them looking at his
book without a blush. They sit around
his bow-windowed shop all day, lolling
on the fantastically expensive Georgian
sofas and everything, and in the end
say: “I’ll tell you what I want” and
he thinks, thank God, at last “I want
a taxi. Get one for me.” “House and
Garden” asked him to write 800 words
on the terrible things Saturday shop-
pers do, and he’s gonna expose the lot.

ON BEING A
KISSING COUSIN
OF PUSSY GALORE
A THRILLER entitled “The Sixth
Column,” by Peter Fleming, has been
reissued in a paperback edition by
Tandem Books. On the cover, the pub-
lishers say: “Written by the brother of
the creator of James Bond.” As I do not
know Peter Fleming, I cannot say how
he feels about this designation, but it
strikes me as being tactless. He enjoyed
considerable fame as the author of
travel books like “Brazilian Adventure”
long before his younger brother, lan,
became known to the public. It would
have shown more delicacy if Tandem
Books had let the elder Fleming be
judged on his merits rather than his
family connections.
These publishers evidently believe in
the idea of talent by kinship. They
assume that people will buy the book
because the brother of the creator of
James Bond must possess an inherited
capacity to thrill. This belief, however,
rests on shaky grounds.
Certainly it is not unknown for sport-
ing, artistic, or other gifts to recur in
more than one member of a family. All
three of the Bronte sisters had some
flair for writing fiction. Sir Michael Red-
grave has two daughters who are
competent actresses. Yet there are many
cases where consanguinity does not have
such fortunate side-effects. One of the
most painful experiences I have had in
a place of entertainment was listening
to a program given in a Las Vegas
hotel by the four sons of Bing Crosby.
It was enough to make Mendel himself
abandon all belief in the principles of
heredity.
Perhaps Tandem Books are astute,
and some people really are naive enough
to think that blood-relationship to a
celebrity implies possession of similar
talents. But advertisers addressing their
appeals to the more discerning public
raiely, if ever, take this line of approach.
Messrs. Faber and Faber would not
recommend a volume of poems because
they were written by a sister of T. S.
Eliot. Nor, I think, would Sotheby’s
expect art collectors to bid eagerly for
a painting by an uncle of Van Gogh.
Persons who are closely related to
the famous are often sensitive about
it. If they are obscure, they feel that
the contrast emphasises their obscurity.
If they are making a reputation of
their own, they do not want to be in
somebody else’s shadow. I was once
at a lunch where the guest-of-honor
was the amiable novelist Alec Waugh.
At no point did he mention his more
renowned and less amiable brother
Evelyn, and I sensed that it would
have been indiscreet to bring the
subject up. The cinematic sisters
Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine
not only used different names but
were reputedly on distant terms. If
in their years of fame any promoter
had billed Miss de Havilland as “the
sister of Joan Fontaine,” or vice versa,
the screams would doubtless have been
heard from coast to coast.
In the sporting field a champion’s
relations have to prove their abilities
in the same way as anyone else.
Messrs. Maurice and Ronald Raper
hold their positions in Sydney Rugby
League football teams by reason of
their proficiency at the game. They
are not shown any special deference
by players or spectators because they
happen to be brothers of the celebrated
John Raper.
Friendship with the great is a dif-
ferent matter. Many people feel that
it confers a kind of distinction; hence
the common habit of name-dropping.
A noteworthy instance was the minor
musician who had printed on his visit-
ing cards “Friend of Beethoven.” But
it does not pay to be regarded merely
as a friend of the famous and nothing
more. English society papers used to
humiliate such peripheral persons by
omitting their names from the cap-
tions of photographs: “Seen at Ascot:
the Hon. Percy Dillwood, Lady
Angela Creape, and friend.”
Name-dropping is a hazardous
practice, because unless it is done
sparingly and with . exquisite un-
obtrusiveness it annoys people instead
of impressing them. Yet we must
accept that in some circles it is usual,
and that not only the eminent but
their relations are considered worthy
of mention.
At a cocktail party given by Tandem
Books, for example, this gay chatter
could be heard: “Hello! I’d like you to
meet Malcolm Muggeridge’s nephew;
this is a brother of the creator of
James Bond. There are some fascinat-
ing people here a friend of Morris
West, and Harold Robbins’ niece, and
a second cousin of Enid Blyton. Here
comes Mickey Spillane’s aunty! I
can’t wait to read her new book . . .”

OF A SYMBOL
Recently a triodetic dome was
inspected at the University of
N.S.W. School of Architecture.
Triodetic is a further example of
the expanding product range by
George Hudson.
Agreed, the Company was tra-
ditionally known for its timber
activities. Milling; Importing;
Retailing.
More recently, a carefully
planned diversification pro-
gramme has created a new
range of sophisticated products
for specific building require-
ments. The Company’s pro-
gramme also provides a wide
range of integrated products and
services to subcontractors for
total-concept activities. Corpo-
rately, this is the same George
Hudson. Operationally, it is a
much more updated enterprise,
activated by modern manage-
ment methods and dedicated to
an alert, contemporary policy of
product development.
This policy, whilst based on the
Company’s traditional skills, has
been carefully adapted to meet
the changing needs of today’s
conditions.
New policies, new products, new
processes—these represent the
significance of the new GH

POLITICIANS PLAY MUSICAL CHAIRS
Comment by Alan Reid
SURVIVAL is the first law of politics.
Consequently it is not the U.S. Presi-
dential elections, Vietnam, the Budget,
and the state of the national economy
that currently dominates the thoughts
of Federal Parliamentarians. It is
electoral redistribution.
With the ALP Federal Executive
directive issued last week to Labor
Parliamentarians not to oppose the
redistribution proposals submitted by
the Electoral Commissioners, Parlia-
mentarians can now plan their futures
within a reasonably certain context.
Provided the Liberals do not run away
from the proposals, it is certain the
Parliament will endorse them.
Labor confronts the worst problems.
In Melbourne, the seat of Yarra held
by Dr. Jim Cairns has been abolished.
His power base Richmond has
been incorporated into Melbourne, held
by Mr. Arthur Calwell. Dr. Cairns is a
potential future leader of the Labor
Party, the likely successor to the present
Opposition Leader, Mr. Gough Whit-
lam, if Mr. Whitlam does badly at the
next elections and fails either to win
the Prime Ministership or sufficient
new seats to offset his declining hold
upon the Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party caucus. Mr. Calwell is Mr. Whit-
lam’s predecessor in the leadership.
The Victorian ALP Executive is under
a two-way pressure. Mr. Calwell, who
has saved them in the past from ALP
Federal intervention arising from the
Executive’s Left-wing and anti-Whitlam
leanings, has told them he wants an-
other term in the Federal Parliament
before he retires. But the Executive
also has ideological debts to Dr. Cairns.
As I understand it, the Executive has
told Mr. Calwell that, despite his years,
it will take no action that would force
him into a retirement earlier than he
contemplates. If he wants to stay on
in Melbourne, he can. Dr. Cairns is
being offered Lalor, a suburban seat
which the Executive believes under the
new redistribution proposals will be only
marginally weaker from Labor’s view-
point than Melbourne, now one of the
best Labor “blue ribbon” seats in Aus-
tralia. There is a danger in this from
Cairns’ viewpoint. Even in Yarra, with
its hard core of Labor traditionalists,
Cairns with his “new look” radicalism
was hard-pressed at elections. It would
be much easier for his Liberal opponents
to get at him in a suburban seat liable
to have a much smaller hard-core
Labor base than Richmond.
In Sydney, the situation for Labor
and Labor Parliamentarians is even
tougher. Mr. Jim Cope, Mr. Len
Devine, and Mr. William O’Connor
have been dispossessed. Their seats of
Watson, East Sydney, and Dailey have
been absorbed largely into the seat of
Sydney, which under the name of West
Sydney has been held by picturesque
Irish-Australian Dan Minogue. Mr.
Minogue is over 70 and is fighting a
valiant rearguard action against en-
forced retirement. Mr. Whitlam wants
Mr. Cope to win Sydney. The Left
Wing want Mr. Devine to win. Mr.
Whitlam wants Prospect, the new seat
carved out of part of Werriwa, his own
seat, and Reid, held by Mr. Tom Uren,
for his son, Tony. Mr. Whitlam, jun.,
like his father, is tall, but bulkier he
was a very good Rugby Union line-out
forward when he was playing for the
Australian National University and,
also like father, a lawyer. But Whit-
lam, sen., is running into snags. A lot
of locals claim that Whitlam, jun., is
unblooded and should take his turn
contesting seats hopeless from Labor’s
viewpoint before he has a constituency
handed to him on a platter.
The Liberals have their troubles.
Trouble could develop between the
Treasurer, Will,am McMahon, and the
Attorney - General, Nigel Bowen.
Though still on the proposed redistri-
bution a safe Liberal seat, with a
Liberal majority on the 1961 election
figures when the Liberals were at
their lowest for a decade, Mr. Bowen’s
Parramatta has lost a nice slice of
Liberal territory to Mr. McMahon’s
Lowe. A group of young Liberals are
also organising to see whether they
can challenge people like Mr. Harry
Turner and Sir John Cramer in the
Liberal strongholds of Bradfield and
Bennelong.
The Country Party also has its
troubles. It has lost Lawson in N.S.W.,
but here the situation is not acute.
Mr. - Laurie Failes was contemplating
retirement at the next elections.
Its worries arise as much out of
Labor’s plans as the redistribution.
If, as is expected, the Queensland and
Western Australian ALP branches
follow the Victorian ALP’s lead and
decide to allocate ALP preferences
permanently to the Liberals ahead
of the Country Party, the Country
Party could lose seats in all three
States. It cannot afford to lose seats.
Its present strength is 21, and it
cannot go back much further without
losing representation in Cabinet
where it has three ministers out of
12 and also representation in the
Ministry.
. For the next few weeks it will not
be national issues that will be pre-
occupying Canberra’s Parliamen-
tarians. It will be redistribution and
the effect the redistribution has upon
their individual fates.
For if they cannot survive it will
be others, not they, who will have
to grapple with those national prob-
lems.
ISN'T IT TIME TO BURY THE ASHES?
Comment by Batman
MELBOURNE’S State Electricity
Commission has made the solemn
pronouncement that there has been a
remarkable change in Test cricket
listening habits. Ten years ago when
there was a Test match on in England
the SEC could count on a five percent
increase in demand for power.
The cricket lovers as they sat
through the night used their lights,
their radios, and their radiators. SEC
men could even report on the state
of the game by the power fluctuations.
If it was tea time, or, say, the scoring
rate was slow, then on would come
the electric jugs, stoves, and electric
toasters. People always eat to make
up for their frustrations.
But now there is barely any per-
ceptible increase in power. According
to the SEC, the listeners are taking to
their beds with their transistors and
their earplugs. In this new era the
Test cricket bottle party is finished
and the listener is battery powered.
There might be another possibility.
No power is being used because nobody
is listening. I put forward this theory
as a passionate cricket lover. I have
listened in to all the English Test
broadcasts, dating right back to the
’thirties. By good training and superb-
single-minded application it was pos-
sible to survive a five-day Test match,
stay awake to 3 or 3.30 every morn-
ing, and still go to work the same day.
Now it doesn’t matter any more. It
L a l most impossible to listen. We have
a situation where a Fifth Test starts
on Friday, but it is of no importance,
because the Ashes are won. As Brian
Scovell, of the London Sketch,

Test was over, Sorry, folks. That s it

Test match they would have to guar-
antee $28,000. So if you take $28,000
as the basic value of a Test with the
15 drawn matches, 75 days of adult
activity and $270,000 have gone for
nought.
The statistics on draws are interest-
ing. We have had 107 England-
Australia Test matches in Australia with
12 drawn. We have had 95 in England
with 45 drawn. So in the history of the
game the odds are always against finish-
ing a cricket match in England.
Four times we have managed to com-
plete only one Test match in a series.
I asked two former Test captains, lan
Johnson and Lindsay Hassett, for their
solutions. lan Johnson said: “The basic
problem is that they are not getting
through enough overs. If you go back
to the statistics in 1921, Gregory and
McDonald did 60 percent of the bowl-
ing and Australia got through 120 balls
an hour. Now with a similar amount
of fast bowling they get through about
100 balls an hour. In six hours of
cricket that is a difference of 120 balls
a day, and if you take it over a five-
day match it is the equivalent of a
whole day’s play. As far as I’m con-
cerned that would make all the dif-
ference in finishing matches. The slow-
ing down of the bowling rate was started
by Hutton in 1954 on the theory that
this dropped the tempo of the game
and destroyed the batsman’s concentra-
tion. We followed in 1958 and it has
been the same ever since.”
Lindsay Hassett agreed with lan
Johnson on the bowling rate, but he
said English weather was the real prob-
lem. Test matches should be allowed
extra hours for time lost due to rain.
What about the rigid schedules laid
down? This idea would bring little
enthusiasm from the counties. Hassett
said the problem wouldn’t be too hard
to solve. They could introduce Sunday
play, then always leave a vacant day on
the schedule after each Test match. An
extra day would solve most problems.
Then one asked about the awful gravity
with which the game was played. He
said: “It’s a funny old game. You
don’t realise how unimportant it is to
win until you are not playing it any
more.”
And this is the crux of the thing.
Cricket is like Chinese opera, some-
thing that is carried out interminably
for five days, done not so much for
anyone’s enjoyment but as a rite, as a
piece of indigenous folklore. Then
because of the Oedipus conflict between
the two countries there is a fearful
loss of face to be suffered in a draw.
However, after playing Test matches
since 1876 we should be tempering this
a little.
As for the Ashes, the best thing would
be to have a funeral sendee at last and
commit them to the deep in neutral
territory, preferably off the continental
shelf in the deepest part of the Indian
Ocean. Then someone might start play-
ing cricket again.


7 Jeffrey Penfold Hyland talks about wine.
\
Ya
? -■
On ordering wine-the fears and the joys
How many times have you been
out to dinner with friends, and
because they know you’re interested
in wine, they say “Choose the wine
for us”.
If you feel slight pangs of panic
when this happens, don’t feel you are.
alone. Because even people with
years of experience in wine are often
placed in the same predicament as
you find yourself now.
Though we realize that the old
‘rule’ “Red wine with red meats,
white wine with white meats” is not
really a rule, it is important to con-
sider how the taste of the wine you
select will go with the food you have
chosen. For example, grilled meats
and roasts with their pronounced
flavours seem better suited to the full
bodied taste of a good claret, while
delicate flavours (like most fish
dishes) are better teamed with a deli-
cate light wine like Dalwood Ries-
ling, Hock, or Chablis. You might
like to try a burgundy with roast
chicken . . . and Dalwood White
Burgundy with a steak. The only
right wine is the wine you like, but
remember, you don’t want either the
wine or the food to dominate. Let
them become perfect partners.
On the classic wine type
names what they mean
For many years some Australians
have attempted to get winemakers to
stop using French or German wine
type names to describe Australian
wines. However, nobody has yet pro-
vided a fully workable alternative. A
claret in Australia means a “claret”
styled wine. This means it is red, dry,
full bodied and has a characteristic
tannin finish in all, a similar style
of wine to “clarets” around the
world. Similarly, hock is like the
German white wines of the Rhine
Valley a Chablis or White Bur-
gundy like the white wines of
Burgundian France and a Cham-
pagne like the famous sparkling
wines from Rheims. Naturally, Aus-
tralian wines are different from their
overseas counterparts, but in descri-
bing the style of a wine the broad
characteristics identified with the
famous wine types the names used
are hard to better. Simply from the
“style”, you immediately have some
broad idea of what to expect when
you draw the cork and pour the wine
for yourself and your friends even if
you’ve never bought that particular
wine before.
Jeffrey Penfold Hyland
started with Penfolds
as cellar hand in 1928.
During the 1930’5,
he was employed as a
winemaker with Penfolds.
After serving with the A.I.F.
during the War, he rejoined
Penfolds, being made
a Director in 1951.
In 1963, he was

AUSTRALIA
Will the team hold together?
AFTER A FULL week of fishing,
swimming, and just lolling in the sun
off Northern Queensland, Prime Min-
ister Gorton is back in Canberra in
the hurly-burly of a Budget session of
Parliament. There is not a great deal
of legislation to be got through this
session. In fact, the policy-making
machinery seems to have noticeably
slowed down this year, and most of
the laws to be enacted are rather
routine enabling measures to allow the
work of government to run on.
Mr. Gorton’s main problems are
political. First and foremost, he has to
hold his team together. Stories of
dissension within the Ministry have
spread remarkably during the parlia-
mentary recess, and it is now generally
agreed that at least two senior Ministers
Mr. Hasluck and Mr. Fairhall
will most likely retire from political
life within the next year. The Prime
Minister must work to postpone at
least one of these retirements until after
the next elections, or else he’ll give
tremendous ammunition to the Labor
Party, allowing it to claim that his
Government is falling to pieces. Back-
benchers and officials in the Party
machine are unhappy, too.
Political observers in Canberra were
astonished late last week at Interior
Minister Nixon’s speech in Darwin,
which appeared to be a major Govern-
ment pronouncement on Aboriginal
affairs. If all were well within the
Government, this sort of statement
would have been made by the Minister
in Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr.
Wentworth. However, it appears that
his policy has been overruled by
Cabinet. The statement of Aboriginal
policy was obviously not in line with
Mr. Wentworth’s thinking. The guess
is that the speech was drafted by Mr.
Nixon in consultation with Mr. Has-
luck.
So far, at least, Mr. Gorton has
managed to contain the McMahon-
McEwen dispute, but only at the cost
of losing the able Mr. McMahon as
an active, forceful member of the team.
The Treasurer, who has come briefly
into the limelight during Budget week,
has been a most subdued man since
the assault against him in January
by Mr. McEwen. It appears that Mr.
Gorton sided heavily with the Country
Party leader during that dispute despite
the campaigning being done for him
by Mr. McMahon. The first Cabinet
meeting of the Gorton Government
was called to instruct the Treasurer
to cut off all contact with Mr. Max-
well Newton, the Canberra journalist
whom Mr. McEwen dislikes.
Mr. Gorton’s second problem is when
to stage the elections. They are not due
for 15 months yet, but Mr. Gorton is
very seriously thinking about holding
them in November or March. He would
like to get a mandate of his own, a
short, sharp campaign, and then three
clear years to establish himself as a
Prime Minister. Now that Mr. Whit-
lam’s scheme of opposing the electoral
redistribution has been rejected by his
colleagues, that should sail through
Parliament without much trouble.
The reasons for considering early
elections are many: if the Government
isn’t in very good shape, the Labor
Party is in even worse condition. Mr.
Whitlam has been publicly rebuffed
and humiliated by his own Party on at
least three occasions (or is it more?)
this year. His sheer political ineptitude
makes him the despair of his rapidly
diminishing band of supporters. Far
from being Leader of the Labor Party,
he isn’t any longer even the leader of
the moderate faction of the Party. He
remains at best a sort of PR-man with
quite minimal influence over the
policies he is required to pronounce.
That, at least, is the way Liberals are
going to be able to portray him in an
election campaign.
August twelve months hence is almost
certain to require a tougher Budget
than has just been brought down. By
that time, Mr. Gorton is going to have
a number of schemes which will cost
money. Australia may also be in some
balance of payments trouble, and the
economy may need to be cured of
“overheating.” Tax rises are almost
certain in 1969.
Against an election is, firstly, the
fact that Mr. Gorton cannot claim to
have done very much in his first year
as Prime Minister. He hasn’t much per-
formance to sell to voters. More im-
portant a factor in favor of deferral is
the huge Government majority now
resident in the House of Representa-
tives. Can John Gorton do better than
Harold Holt at his peak? If he can’t,
then the Government will lose seats
and that will be interpreted by many
as a defeat for the new Prime Minister.
Mr. Gorton is keen to come up with
concrete proposals for reforming Wel-
fare. He has a committee working on
health insurance, and the next thing
is to examine cash Social Service bene-
fits. If there is to be an early election,
he will want these reforms to be quickly
formulated so that he can present them
as part of his program.
The Senate will be busy with com-
mittees: At present there are four: on
offshore petroleum, air and water pol-
lution, and medical and health costs.
The active DLP team can be expected
to initiate a number of moves in the
Parliament which will keep the Cabinet
on edge.
Apart from election considerations,
Treasurer McMahon ... briefly into
the limelight during Budget week
Mr. Gorton has to decide in the next
three months what his defence policy
is going to be. In his address to the
National Press Club he committed the
Government to a major statement in
November, at the time that the next
three-year defence program is finally
due to emerge. So far, at least, the
preparation of the new program is on
schedule.
WOOL MARKETING
COMPROMISE NEEDED
“THIS IS THE weakest and most in-
decisive body I have ever been involved
in,” declared a delegate to the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference in
Canberra last week. The speaker, Mr.
P. B. Leach, from Victoria, was ex-
pressing a widely felt frustration with
the workings of the organisation they
once liked to call the Parliament of
the wool industry.
The so-called Parliament cannot
decide anything whatever. It can, and
does, recommend, but it is left to other
bodies to decide and implement. Last
week’s conference once again talked
about wool marketing. It made con-
siderable progress on straightforward
reforms of systems. The elimination of
small lots of wool and the enforcement
of higher standards of wool preparation
were agreed to without much trouble.
So was the establishment of a market
intelligence unit. These will be rela-
tively inexpensive operations which
woolgrowers should be able to finance.
Other marketing measures, however,
require Commonwealth Government
financial support. One, a price-
averaging scheme, would aim to
equalise prices received by growers sell-
ing at different centres in each State.
It would also provide advance payment.
The marketing committee, which drew
up the proposal, said it would probably
run at a loss and would need about
$2 million a year from the Govern-
ment. This proposal was agreed to with-
out much dissension, but whether the


Gunn ... too complicated to define
Government will agree is quite another
matter.
As usual at woolgrower conferences
the main bone of contention was the
proposal for a reserve price authority,
or “supply management” as it is these
days known. Its proponents are rather
on the defensive these days, since wool-
growers overwhelmingly rejected such a
scheme in a referendum in 1965, and
the Government is most reluctant to
get involved. The New Zealand scheme
on which it was modelled has proved
a dramatic failure.
The Australian Wool Industry Con-
ference further watered down the
scheme for “supply management,”
though the way this will operate has
never been precisely defined. The con-
ference made it clear how it should not
operate. “There shall be no stockpiling
of wool,” it declared, and defined stock-
piling as the building of a “buffer-stock”
or “the withdrawal of wool from the
market in quantities which would
accumulate stocks in excess of normal.”
Neither of these definitions is very
helpful, since they entirely beg the rele-
vant questions. When does a stock
become a buffer-stock? And what is
the level of “normal” stocks?
Members of the Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council put these questions
to Sir William Gunn in their meetings
with him, and he replied that it was
too complicated to define. He had tried
and written three pages on the subject,
but found there was so much to be
considered that he gave up.
Without any clear definition of
“supply management,” the conference
went on to vote on whether the mana-
ger should be a co-operative corpora-
tion or a statutory authority. The
smaller growers who have the numbers
at the AWIC won through fairly con-
vincingly, getting their vote for a
statutory authority by 37 to 17.
They argued that control by bankers
and brokers could be avoided only by
an organisation created and supported
by the Government. But the basic argu-
ment in favor of a statutory authority
was that this is the best means of get-
ting subsidies forward the way the
wheat, sugar, and dairying industries
get taxpayers’ money.
Wool Board chairman Sir William
Gunn intervened unsuccessfully, trying
to avert a vote at the conference. He
said a vote would damage the prospects
of implementing the scheme, since the
Government had stated that unless the
industry was practically unanimous it
would not act. He is almost certainly
correct.
Four years ago the conference voted
45 to 5 in favor of a reserve price
scheme, which was subsequently re-
jected at a referendum by growers, so
the 37 to 17 vote is hardly likely to
encourage the Government to hold
another referendum.
Meanwhile, the proposals are being
put to the councils of wool-industry
organisations, and being amended by
the Wool Board with a view to reach-
ing a compromise which the whole
industry can accept and which the
Government might consider supporting.
There is to be a further conference in
November.
VICTORIAN LABOR
THE STRUCTURE
AS MR. WHITLAM smoothed his hair
for another TV interview, the
correspondent of the Communist
“Tribune” turned to look at the
panorama of Melbourne below. “A bit
bourgeois,” he said as the uniformed
waiter at his elbow proffered whisky,
gin, and caviar.
The occasion was the launching of
“The Good Oil,” a pamphlet written
by Clyde Holding, MLA, Leader of the
Victorian Labor Opposition. Held in
the State Suite of the Southern Cross,
venue of all Melbourne’s big PR affairs,
the function typified Holding’s stylish
approach to politics.
After Mr. Whitlam had exhorted the
representatives of the mass media to
carry the message of Victoria’s “sell
out” across the continent, he gave the
floor to the youthful Mr. Holding, who,
complete with wall map, gave a resume
of his glossy, 26-page monograph, which
details his case against Sir Henry
Bolte’s management of Victoria’s off-
shore oil and gas agreements with the
Esso-BHP consortium.
Mr. Holding said he was not just
launching a pamphlet, he was beginning
a campaign which would be based on
a simple basis and on a simple propo-
sition: “Gas and oil are essentially
the property of all the people of the
State and the Commonwealth, and
should only be exploited in the
interests of these people.”
At 37, Holding is the senior partner
of one of Melbourne’s three leading
firms of industrial solicitors and has
been State Labor Leader since early in
1967. With light blue eyes and a
provocative chin, he explains the
similarity of his and his friend Don
Dunstan’s political approach as a
matter of youth. “It’s a generation
Holding (r.) ... selling political ideas
thing: people tend to overlook the
difference in generations.”
He and ex-Premier Dunstan tend to
see structures, organisations, and pro-
cedures in the same light. “Organisa-
tionally and structurally the ALP is
one of the most conservative forces in
Australian life. In terms of its own
structure, its resistence to change would
do credit to half of Australia’s big
business groups.”
Holding believes that there is no
way in which the old Party structure
can compete with the organisation of
its opponents. The State Liberal head-
quarters has three to four times more
staff than the Labor Party office. “We
are selling political ideas: not merely
an alternative Government. We are
selling a view of society.” The ALP,
he argues, must not only have the
structure market; it must be decentral-
ised so that members of the Party at
all levels can exert influence on policies
and attitudes.
The detailed work on policy which
its Parliamentary Party has done must
be publicised, he says. “We have done
much it is imaginative and thought-
provoking and all of the documents
we have produced stand in their own
right, providing the basis for discussion
of the subject, but who knows about
them?”
As evidence of his Party’s new drive
he cites the creation of panels of
advisers for each shadow Minister.
Experts in the field, not necessarily
members of the ALP, are asked to come
along and give their opinions and sug-
gestions for reform. So far, no one has
refused. In this way, the shadow Minis-
ters (not all are shadowing, as Holding
intends to create a special portfolio for
the Arts) are provided with the best
available knowledge: “The Government’s
Bill for Aboriginal administration was
largely based on our own proposals.”
Currently reading Marshal McLuhan,
he stresses that his Party is trying to
grapple with the problems of com-
munications. “I realised there was a
new dimension to politics when I first


appeared on television.” He was sitting
between breasty Daliah Lavi and Mel-
bourne’s answer to Nero, actor Frank
Thring.
As a radical Party, he envisages
Labor approaching the new media in
a radical way to fully exploit their
potential. “We are competing on an
open market of ideas. If we are to
persuade the electorate that our ideas
are preferable, we cannot rely on a
narrow Party alone. It must be broad
enough to embody a wide spectrum
of views and be able to draw on ideas
from without.”
Last year, a conference on the Arts
was held, also at the Southern Cross,
where people who would never join a
political party could go along and put
their views without fear of political
involvement. A similar conference will
be held around the theme of mental
hygiene.
Holding believes the Labor Party
could not operate as a radical, reform-
is force if it were not pluralist and
if it did not draw from the diverse
traditions of Catholicism, Calvinism,
Chartism, and Marxism. The ferment
of the new student generation, with
their ideas imbibed from the American
sociologists, serves as an example of
the sort of influence Holding finds
beneficial.
The constant friction caused by the
clash of traditions is regarded as a
strength and not destructive. “Friction
causes problems, but it is both neces-
sary and desirable. After all, political
decisions are essentially compromise
decisions, but that is the process of
politics.”
It was in this sense that the Liberal
Party was static, a Party of the status
quo. Clashes are confined to the clash
of competing Commonwealth and State
bureaucracies. The lack of any philos-
ophy of Government, or any clear defi-
nition of the area of Commonwealth
and State responsibilities, had produced
a crises type of growth. Liberal
Premiers were moving from one emerg-
ency situation to the next. Growth
decisions were made by the Common-
wealth while the States were unable to
finance them, i
Holding claims that it is Labor’s
acceptance of a total philosophy of
government which will enable it to
meet what he calls, the “really great
challenge of the technological era.” In
the past, the Labor Parties demanded
the changes in social structure which
have helped to increase the freedoms
and dignity of man. Many abuses have
been rectified, but the processes of mass
technocracy are now placing even
greater burdens of the individual to
conform and reduce his freedoms.”
He says he is talking about the
quality of life we are leading, and the
life we could be leading. He frames his
response in subjective terms: “I can
physically see thousands of kids going
down the drain in my electorate for
no other reason than that they do not
have equal educational opportunities.”
Holding does not place himself in
any one of Labor’s traditional streams
of thought. “The racial heritage of the
movement has been embodied by all
its great spokesmen at different points
of Labor’s history. No, there is no one
figure I lean toward.”
He talks of one scheme which does
not smack of traditional Labor atti-
tudes. “Eighteen months ago I did a
tour of South-East Asia. One of the
ideas I brought back is the beginning of
a close relationship between the young
members of the ALP and the young
Asian politicians. We tend to be smug
about our political capacities, but most
of these Asians are streets ahead of
Australian politicians.”
BRITAIN'S MR. HEATH
MR. "LONG-TERM"
BRITAIN’S CONSERVATIVE leader,
Mr. Edward Heath, gave Western Aus-
tralians some carefully hedged encour-
agement for their particular interests
when he started a two-week tour of
Australia from Perth last week. If the
Conservatives go back into power, he
said, the British would not plan to
desert the Indian Ocean area, nor did
they intend to cut off the flow of the
investment that has meant so much to
Australia’s economic prosperity.
Investment prophets could not be
optimistic at what Mr. Heath had to
say about a possible curbing of British
funds if the Conservatives returned to
power, however. They could encourage
investment, he said, particularly in
growth areas like Western Australia;
this had always been the pattern of
British policy. But it would be neces-
sary to build up the British economy.
Asked whether or not this would take
priority, Mr. Heath said he felt it
would be a simultaneous operation. On
what he said, the short-term effect of a
Conservative win would seem to be a
drying-up of the Wilson-dodging
money; particularly since Mr. Heath
added that he hoped to give full rein
to the dynamics of free enterprise and
withdraw the pegging of British divi-
dends.
The man who negotiated for Britain
to join the Common Market still main-
tains that Britain going in will do Aus-
tralia good. Such a move will make,
he says, for a stronger Britain, a
stronger Europe, and a stronger
Western world, broadening the markets
for Australia and other primary-produc-
ing countries.
He did not go along with the trend
of questioning which hoped that he
would blame Mr. Wilson personally
for Britain’s current dilemma a dil-
emma, he added, which could be over-
come because of the British people’s
reserves of inventiveness and resource.
Of all the failures of Mr. Wilson, Mr.
Heath saw the most damaging as his
claim, early in his term of office, that
Britain had been irreparably harmed
by Conservative rule, a claim that
started the slide in British stocks over-
seas.
It was being asked, Mr. Heath said,
whether Britain was to resume the role
Heath (l.) welcomed to the West by
Premier Brand
of global police-force. This was a posi-
tion that had been misconstrued; cer-
tainly it was one that Britain would
not want to resume, if indeed, it was
one Britain had ever filled. “We are
not a super-power like the United
States or Russia, or like China will
be in a generation, or like Europe
could be if they had the sense to
organise themselves properly,” said the
Tory leader.
While Britain no longer wanted such
a role as global police-force, he made
it clear that the Conservatives’ strategy
differed from Mr. Wilson’s. They be-
lieved, he said, that it was possible for
Britain to maintain her forces both in
the Persian Gulf and in South-East
Asia. But this proposition was hedged
with his claim that there is a great
misunderstanding about the role of
Britain in this area. The extent of
British forces East of Suez could not be
compared with the pre-1939 era, when
they were there as Indian Empire
forces, nor with the time of the Indon-
esian confrontation build-up. But
within these limitations he felt it would
be possible to stem the planned 1971
withdrawal.
Mr. Heath, asked whether or not he
supported the domino theory in Viet-
nam, said that he, like the Russians,
believed that neighboring countries
would inevitably be affected by a Com-
munist takeover. He did not always
agree with the tactics or strategy of the
Americans in Vietnam, he said, “but it
ill behoves us to criticise the people who
are extending so much” in trying to
keep the peace in South-East Asia. He
views British presence in Singapore
and Malaysia as complementary to the
American and Allied involvement in
Vietnam.
Of the position at home, Mr. Heath
stressed that the Conservatives under
his leadership had attained a higher
degree of control of local government


than any other party ever had. And it
was in the polling booths that politics
were decided. This point was made
several times during his short stay in
Perth, where he said also that the Con-
servatives were using their time in
Opposition to hammer out policies in a
way that had not been done before.
Mr. Heath was frank about what he
called the agonising decision within the
House of Commons about sending arms
to Nigeria to be used against Biafra.
This was done, he said, in the hope that
it would enable Britain to retain some
degree of control over Nigeria’s actions.
He was equally frank about his posi-
tion regarding Commonwealth migra-
tion to Britain, pointing out that he
framed the five-point policy: (i) limit-
ing migration to Britain, (ii) limiting
the type and number of dependants,
(iii) helping those who wanted to re-
turn home to do so, (iv) helping local
government bodies with special prob-
lems brought about by migrants, (v)
undertaking that all Britons were
treated the same.
By the time he had flown northward
from Perth, to look over British invest-
ments in the iron-ore development, Mr.
Heath had built up hopes about his
country’s long-term defence commit-
ments around Australia’s north and the
long-term trend of British investment;
though whether or not this investment
would be encouraged to continue at the
current rate if the Conservatives were
returned to power is another thing.
His refusal to elaborate on Conserva-
tive policy over a naval base in Cock-
burn Sound, a long-cherished Western
Australian dream, was backed up by
the plausible claim that this was one
of the main topics he intended to dis-
cuss with the Prime Minister, Mr. Gor-
ton, and it would be unfair to preju-
dice these discussions with off-the-cuff
comments. (Cockburn Sound is a vast
area bounded by a string of islands and
the coastline south of Fremantle; a
feasibility study is under way to test its
capacity. Britain’s Labor leaders have
said they have asked for allowance to
be made in planning for a possible
British presence.)
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
WINDS OF REFORM
THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN Parlia-
ment, equally divided as it is, seems
well on the way to working out an
Electoral Reform Bill acceptable to
both Parties. Last week, after four days
studying the Government’s proposals,
the Opposition Leader, Mr. Don
Dunstan, announced that the Opposi-
tion was prepared to support the Bill
in principle, though it intended to table
a number of amendments for discus-
sion when the Bill is in committee.
These would certainly deal with one
aspect of the metropolitan and country
quotas, which could allow, for instance,
a country seat of some 8000 electors
and a city seat of some 16,000 electors,
a difference the Opposition is obviously
Dunstan ... votes for 18-year-olds
not prepared to accept. Still, with both
sides chorusing the need for compro-
mise, it would seem that the more
appalling aspects of the South Austra-
lian gerrymander will shortly be
removed.
As the Parties settled down to deal-
ing with the ordinary business of the
session, two noteworthy reform meas-
ures were announced. Mr. Dunstan
tabled a motion which would give full
adult responsibility to people aged 18,
and amend provisions in the Constitu-
tion, and the Licensing and Lottery and
Gaming Acts, where they contain pro-
visions relating to the age of responsi-
bility. The measure, set to be debated
this week, is not expected to get very
far. The Adelaide “Advertiser,” in its
editorial, probably expressed the pith
of the matter and the way in which
the idea has been greeted by the more
conservative sections of the Govern-
ment. Remarking that desires to be in
the vanguard of social and political
reform naturally create sympathy, it
added that the State should have “the
benefits of older countries’ investiga-
tion, thought, and experience before
taking action.”
Even if it were prepared to act on
the matter, the Government would
probably not allow such an important
piece of reform legislation to originate
from the Opposition benches. Judging
by his comments during the Bill’s intro-
duction, the Attorney - General, Mr.
Robin Millhouse, will probably find it
too broad, loose, and embracing in its
provisions, and lead the rejection of
the measure until such time as the
Government can introduce its own Bill.
The Minister for Local Government,
Roads, and Transport, Mr. Murray Hill,
also announced last week a noteworthy
reform move, this time outside the
House. It seems that gentle winds of
change are disturbing Adelaide’s North
Terrace arbors. In announcing that
the South Australian Highways Depart-
ment had called for a national inquiry
into the possibility of introducing right-
hand driving, Mr. Hill again displayed
his remarkable skill in gaining Press
publicity and projecting an active minis-
terial image. A former managing
director of an Adelaide land develop-
ment company, his appointment to the
portfolio of Local Government was
widely criticised in April because of his
known opposition to the town-planning
measures passed by the previous Gov-
ernment.
Since then he has received almost
as much Press space as the Premier,
not only for major departmental and
policy, statements but also for such
relatively minor but aesthetically im-
portant issues as his current investiga-
tion into the cost of a phased removal
of the stobie power-line poles, which
disfigure the settled areas of South Aus-
tralia. The costs are, in fact, very high,
and so far he has not found widespread
support for the proposal on a local-
government level. Likewise, his call for
a national inquiry into right-hand-side
driving by the Australian Transport
Advisory Council is likely to languish
until the Commonwealth can be per-
suaded to interest itself in the change,
and the very large expenditures
involved. Still, with Britain and Aus-
tralasia the only countries driving on
the left, the pressure to conform will
obviously grow. As South Australia is
about to embark upon a major freeway
system for the metropolitan area, it is
obviously to the planners’ advantage if
the question is discussed on a national
level as soon as possible.
SERVICEMEN
PENSIONS QUERY
IF THERE IS one subject which
really annoys Australia’s 100,000 ser-
vicemen it is their retirement pension
scheme (DFRB in the jargon). Another
big campaign against the admistration
of the fund is brewing.
A retired Air-Commodore, Mr.
D. R. Chapman, of Canberra, has just
spent three weeks investigating its
workings and has prepared a lengthy
critique, on which he intends to cam-
paign. He plans to work with the
closest thing servicemen have to a
trade union, the Permanent Defence
Forces Welfare Association. And also
to get the RSL onside.
Mr. Chapman charges that there
have been breaches of the DFRB Act
through not holding five-year investiga-
tions into the workings of the Fund
by the Commonwealth actuary. He
may be wrong in point of law, though
he is undoubtedly right that it has
breached the spirit of the Act.
A sub-section of the Act requires “an
investigation of the state and sufficiency
of the pensions account every five
years.” But only one full actuarial
inquiry has been held in 20 years of
operation, and that in 1964. The Board
showed its own uneasiness by entitling
its first investigation the “third quin-
quennial investigation.”

world of
EASTERN
rlanning
Big Futur^
By Peter Boxall
Eastern's Regional Manager
Browsing through an old book on the
history of transport the other night, I
came across a bi-plane.
Couldn’t help commenting at the time
how planes have changed.
And Eastern is way ahead. In 1971,
for example, the first of Eastern’s Lock-
heed 1011’s will go into service.
The L-1011 will seat up to 300 people
yes 300 in the most superb cabin
luxury imaginable.
There are 8 spacious, individual seats
across the width of the cabin, with 2
aisles for easy access and passenger
convenience.
The L-1011 will have a self-contained
kitchen (a large 13 feet by 15 feet), with
ice-makers, refrigerators and high
speed ovens.
Another new feature of Eastern's
L-1011 is the inclusion of 6 entry doors.
This means passengers will be able to
board 3 times more quickly than on
today's jets.
All in all, Eastern is doing more than
just looking to the future. Eastern has
the future all taken care of . . . with
its super fleet of Lockheed 1011 's.
What a way to fly!

been very hard to come by, the Gov-
ernment Printer saying that they are
not for sale to the public. Mr. Chap-
man has, however, got hold of a copy
and its findings will form the basis of
his campaign for a reform of the Fund.
The report reveals gross mismanage-
ment of records and data as the follow-
ing extracts suggest. “The statistical
and technical data was not available to
enable the Commonwealth actuary to
calculate suitable rates of contribution
. . . The DFRB board has been unable
to supply statements relating to the
movement of contributors and pen-
sioners for two years July 1, 1959 to
June 30, 1961 ... I have been unable
to verify the accuracy of the data sup-
plied for the purpose of my investiga-
tion in the absence of information
covering the whole of the quinquennium
to June 30, 1964 . . . The data avail-
able is insufficient to enable a precise
analysis of the surplus in respect of
pensioners to be made.”
The actuary discovered losses which
have never been mentioned in the
annual reports of the Board. Some of
its assets are listed with the title
“other,” an old subterfuge the Stock
Exchange outlawed years ago.
Mr. Chapman said that in the. past
PHOTO: PETER HARDACRE
Chapman ...“ anomaly” a cherished
word
on the many occasions when he has
referred individual injustices to the
Board they have been described as
“anomalies.” He says “I have long since
learned that ‘anomaly 5 is a most cher-
ished word in. the bureaucratic vocab-
ulary. Whenever errors of commission
or omission, poor judgment, or down-
right negligence are disclosed, they can
be explained away glibly as mere
anomalies.”
His biggest complaint about the
workings of the Fund is that it has
accumulated vastly unnecessary
reserves. Between 1963 and 1967 the
reserves of the Fund more than doubled
and at this rate will continue to grow
at $lO million a year. This suggests
that disbursements in the form of pen-
sions could be increased substantially.
While assets have been increasing at
$lO million a year, pension payments
out of the fund have been rising by as
little as $lOB,OOO a year.
Mr. Chapman says that past mis-
management of the Fund appears to
be the responsibility of so many dif-
ferent individuals that it won’t be pos-
sible to pinpoint responsibility: “It
would be like sitting on an antheap and
then trying to identify which one bit
you.”
He says the Act under which the
DFRB scheme operates must be
repealed as soon as possible to provide

far more than this.
KALGOORLIE
TWILIGHT ZONE
MANY THINGS about Kalgoorlie are
not quite real. This predominantly Irish
town is linked to the outside world by
a 340-mile long umbilical cord, the
water pipeline from Perth. And in
many ways Kalgoorlie is no more part
of Western Australia than Tristan Da
Cunha is of the western world. Take,
for example, Brockman Street a
suburban street two removed from the
main Hannan Street and which, like
so much of suburban Kalgoorlie, seems
to be built almost entirely of corrugated
iron.
With typical Kalgoorlie ingenuity,
Brockman Street is made to disappear
for one block. On this block it becomes
Hay Street, haven of the only openly
tolerated brothels in a white Common-
wealth country. From a distance it is
easy to have a snigger about Hay Street;
but walking down Hay Street of a night
is eerie and sickening, rather like a visit
to an abattoirs for someone who has
been eating and enjoying meat all his
fife.
The tawdry and mundane corrugated
iron is still there, but superimposed on
it is all the glitter that colored neon
fights, nylon fur, and hair lacquer can
create. Walking out of suburban Brock-
man Street into the twilight zone of
Hay Street is traumatic, seeing young
women and girls, often beautiful, sitting
out under these lights on suburban-
style verandas but behind heavy wire
mesh, dressed in. garish fluffy robes.
And while they sit, they knit. Into this
human zoo, cars prowl up and down in
the night, the spectators earning scarcely
a glance from the girls under the lights.
(These fights went out last week as
television cameras joined the other
peering eyes.)
But this is only the beginning of the

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
fantasy, which was brought into the
open last week when former head of
the CIB in Kalgoorlie, Mr. John Wil-
liams, quit the police force and criti-
cised the paradox of the police being
forced to ignore Hay Street, along with
the oldest-established floating “swy”
school in Australia, and the Kalgoorlie
habit of sometimes closing the front
doors of hotels at closing time but
otherwise ignoring the law.
Tackled on this claim, the Minister
for Police, Mr. Jim Craig, parried with
expert logic: “At the time of his resig-
nation, he (Det.-Sgt. Williams) was
only a sergeant third-class holding the
brevet rank of sergeant in the CIB.”
Mr. Craig denied that brothels existed.
He told one questioner: “You’re only
going on impressions from outside. Can
you be more specific and say you have
been into one of these places operating
as a brothel.” Questioner: “I have seen
women sitting in scanty clothing on a
veranda inviting men inside. Now that,
to me, looks like a brothel.” Answer:
“Well, if a woman is in this situation
she is committing an offence, and action
has been taken on many occasions in
this regard. But you see scantily dressed
women anywhere, for that matter.”
Kalgoorlie backs the brothels. When
the girls come into town, as one of
Above: Night view along the block in
which “Brockman St. is made to dis-
appear.” Right: Former Det.-Sgt. John
Williams
them has said: “You’d have to go to
his (the CIB head’s) office, where
they’d be all bows and scrapes, offer
you a cigarette and a chair, and then
talk about how long you’d been a
prostitute and where you’d worked.
Only when the detective-sergeant
thought you were OK and you’d
have to tell him how much you know
about the game would you be
allowed to go to work. You’d tell him
which house you wanted to work in,
and he’d get in touch with the madam
to see if she was prepared to take
you in.” As another former Kalgoorlie
policeman, Mr. Richard Harris, put
it: “You need pretty good references—
a list of about 50 convictions for pros-
titution.”
The madams have their own remark-
able house-rules. The girls cannot
have boyfriends. They cannot drink
during working hours, nor can they go
to town after noon, into hotels, or to
the races. Nor can they swim in the
town’s Olympic pool, except during off-
peak hours. This, according to another
prostitute, was a policy dictated by
the police: “If you became naughty
girls, they would tell you to get out
of town and not come back.”
Doctors are in on the act as well.
One, who defended the way the
brothels are run, said: “The girls come
in once a week for medical checks
and more often if they have any
reason to suspect they might have
picked up VD. While this does not
guarantee complete protection they
would have to be seen after every
client to ensure that it does reduce
chance of disease. The girls are very
health conscious. They are very wary
of any client they suspect might be
infected. So, if there is to be prosti-
tution, it is better that it should be
organised in this manner, where a
check can be kept on the women.”
This is the general attitude in the
town, where it can be pointed out
that, despite the five-to-one ratio of
men to women, sex crime has been vir-
tually abolished. The point is con-
veniently and totally overlooked that
other crimes are condoned for this to
happen. The “swy” school is another
Kalgoorlie landmark, and has been
conducted in the same spot for about
PHOTOS: “WEST AUSTRALIAN”
ten years. But not indiscriminately.
It closes down every second Friday,
when the miners are paid, during race
meetings, and during church services.
Kalgoorlie, then, has drawn up an
admirable blueprint of expediency.
Even the police do not want the
brothels closed down, because they
make their work so much easier; and
everyone realises that the public could
not condone legalising prostitution. To
know they are there but pretend they
don’t exist is a magnificent compromise.
The madams with their scrupulous
house rules and the swy-school operators
with consideration for their potential
opponents —wives, bookies, and priests
—handle the problem with true Irish
logic. In this area law and morals, like
Brockman Street, simply disappear.

How much is
it really a
new Nixon?
Nixon and his running mate,
Governor Spiro Agnew...
“a colorless nonentity”
“THIS,” said Richard Nixon last Wed-
nesday night as he watched three
separate color television sets recording
the eruption of fervor down in the
convention hall, “is just boloney and
a waste of time.” A car was impatiently
ordered and for the next 30 minutes
the man who at that moment was
enjoying the greatest vindication of his
checkered political career was driven
round the garish streets of Miami
Beach accompanied only by two agency
newsmen and the inevitable squad of
secret-service bodyguards.
Whatever else he may be, the Presi-
dential candidate whom the Republican
Party nominated for the second time
last week certainly does not fit the
conventional picture of an American
politician. Without charm, glamor, or
even ebullience, he has always been
the “swot” in politics. (This may,
indeed, be why he has lately come to
seem a surprisingly attractive, sympa-
thetic figure to a new race of indus-
trious but largely uninspired American
political columnists.)
Born 55 years ago in a farming
community in Southern California, he
remains recognisably the local boy who
tried hard and made good. Even his
tastes are mundane and predictable—
his chosen church Dr. Norman Vincent
Peak’s Temple of Positive Thinking
in New York, his favorite food cheese
covered with tomato ketchup, his only
interest outside politics his family.
He is that remarkable phenomenon
—an essentially public man totally
lacking extrovert gifts.
On Thursday night, as he gallantly
tried to do what was required of him—
raising his hands above his head in his
first gesture of triumph after his
nomination —he contrived to look not
only awkward but absurd.
Over the past few months a deter-
mined propaganda effort has been
mounted to demonstrate that all this
has changed: the solitary, secluded
figure of the 19505, the nation has learnt
(with a succession of grinning photo-
graphs as supporting evidence), is now
a gregarious, relaxed human being who
enjoys nothing better than a laugh and
a joke. But last week the legend was
blighted almost before it had had time
to take root. No one but a strangely
sheltered individual completely out
of touch not just with the romantic
demands of the electorate but with the
emotional hunger of his own Party as
well could possibly have selected as
his Vice-Presidential running-mate a
colorless nonentity like Governor Spiro
Agnew, of Maryland.
'So far as Nixon, the Republican
Presidential candidate, is concerned, the
Agnew affair was easily the most re-
vealing incident of convention week.
For it showed that Richard Nixon
remains essentially the same self-
dependent, secretive politician he has
always been. It was not just that he
notably failed to hold any consultations
outside his own palace guard. Men like
Governor Rockefeller, Governor Rom-
ney, and Senator Edward Brooke would
probably never have been enthusiastic
about the selection, but they might at
least have reconciled themselves and
their delegations to it had they been
told about it in advance.
Even more staggering since he
made the decision himself and did not
have it imposed on him was his
failure to foresee what the impact of
his announcement would be. “You know
something?” an embarrassed member of
his staff murmured shortly afterwards.
“He just didn’t understand the gasp
of disbelief that went up in the Press
conference when he gave the news. He
kept asking as he was going out, ‘Why
did they react like that?’ ”
The choice of Agnew was by no
means the only blow that the legend
of “the new Nixon” suffered. Almost
equally devastating was the strange
(and linked) affair of the Republican
nominees’ meeting with the Southern
Caucus on Tuesday morning. At that
time Nixon was not yet his Party’s
chosen standard-bearer: in fact, if there
was a moment during the week when
the Nixon forces were running scared,
this was it. And the revealing thing
about the whole episode was that Nixon
himself reacted to strain in the same
way he has always been accused of
doing in the past by panic. There
seems no doubt now that in his meeting
with the South no doubt out of
fear that its ranks would not stand
solid in the face of the just-announced
candidacy of Ronald Reagan he
went much too far and yielded some
hefty hostages to the Democratic Party
for use during the campaign.
Before he went in to the Southern
Caucus that morning he had .just fin-
ished holding a highly successful Press
conference. His demeanor had been
reasonable, his tone moderate, his man-
ner engaging. If there was a moment
when belief in the “new Nixon” really
gained ground it was then.
But within two hours Nixon blew
the whole thing or rather had it
blown for him by the infiltrated
presence of a highly inconvenient tape-
recorder. Before those gathered
Southern delegations and away, as
he clearly fondly imagined, from the
ear of the liberal Press it was the
old Nixon that was firmly back in
charge. The man who only an hour
or two before had been publicly de-
manding that “the negotiating table
must be big enough and the issues broad
enough so that we could reach an
honorable settlement” was now hinting,
if obliquely, at a possible readiness on
his part to use atomic weapons to
bring Hanoi to its knees and thanks
to that smuggled-in tape-recorder an
extensive excerpt of the meeting duly
appeared in the “Miami Herald.”
But the point lies not so much in
the precise differing statements that
Mr. Nixon made on the two occasions
as in the fact that he was quite obviously
and glaringly using one type of
approach in one room and a quite dif-
ferent one in the other. It is this
chameleon character that explains the
widespread distrust of him still felt
by large sections of the American
electorate. And, instead of managing to
banish those suspicions once and for
all, Nixon’s double-standard perform-
ance has inevitably had the effect of
reinforcing therm
None of this, however, need imply
that his views have not undergone
change. He himself, at least in his
meeting with the Press, went out of
his way to confess that they have. He
had, he said, been rereading the accept-
ance speech that he delivered the last
time he was nominated “and though


I thought it was, frankly, a good
speech, I realise how irrelevant much
of what I said in 1960 is today to the
problems of foreign affairs.”
Nor was that mere window-dressing.
For the man who in 1960 rousingly
proclaimed: “The only answer to a
strategy of victory for the Communist
world is a strategy of victory for the
free world,” certainly struck a very
different note in his second acceptance
speech last week. “To the leaders of
the Communist world,” Nixon declared,
“we say: After an era of confrontation
the time has come for an era of
negotiation. We extend thie hand of
friendship to the Russian people and
to the Chinese people.”
Yet the real difference between the
Presidential candidate of today and
the Vice-President who first came to
office 16 years ago is to be found in
the broader area of his changed views
on the proper purpose and role of
America’s power in the world. The man
who, in 1954, led the forces within
the Eisenhower Administration, who
proposed sending U.S. troops into Dien
Bien Phu, has become, if not an isola-
tionist, then certainly a non-interven-
tionist: “All of America’s peace-keeping
institutions and all of America’s foreign
commitments must be reappraised.” It
may sound like Senator Fulbright, but
it is, in fact, the Republican candidate
for the Presidency of the U.S.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
RALLYING ROUND
MARSHAL TITO’S visit to Prague has
marked the beginning of a widespread
rallying movement by progressive Com-
munist national and Party leaders to
Czechoslovakia’s liberal cause. The
Rumanian leader, Mr. Nicolai Ceau-
sescu, who, like Marshal Tito, stood
firmly by the Czechs in the recent
crisis, is due in Prague shortly and is
expected to be followed by representa-
tives from the French, Italian, and
British Communist Parties.
They are expected to discuss with
the Czechs ways and means of safe-
guarding developments, and to plan a
joint strategy for the International
Communist Conference the first
Communist summit for eight years
scheduled to open in Moscow on Nov-
ember 25. During the Czech crisis
there were rumors that the Russians
wished to postpone the Conference. But
the Yugoslavs now believe that the
Kremlin’s concern about the Moscow
meeting is such that there will be no
further pressure put on Mr. Dubcek
in the immediate future.
Another important element bound
to influence Russia’s attitude toward
the Czechs is the possibility that China,
which has until now remained neutral,
is about to enter the fray. There are
reasons to believe that Peking’s silence,
in contrast to Mao Tse Tung’s violent
reaction to Khrushchev’s military threat
against Poland in 1956, is due to deep
reservations about Czech developments,
although the Chinese undoubtedly en-
joyed the spectacle of Russian blunders.
The Rumanian Ambassador in
Peking, according to Rumanian sources,
was recently called to the Chinese
Foreign Office and, to his surprise, was
received by Chou En Lai, the Chinese
Premier, who discussed the Czech crisis
with him. The Rumanians believe that
the Chinese are planning to send their
ambassadors back to the eastern Euro-
pean capitals, including Bucharest and
Prague, from which they were with-
drawn two years ago.
The consequences of the Soviet step-
down during the Czech crisis on the
remaining hard-line Communist regimes
in Eastern Europe East Germany,
Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria are
seen in Prague as still incalculable. But
the present feeling is that Hungary is
the only country where some move-
ment similar to the Czech experience
could happen in the near future.
The decline in Soviet prestige has
further weakened Janos Kadar’s
position. After Walter Ulbricht, East
Germany’s Party leader, Kadar is
Moscow’s most loyal friend. But it is
Tito...at the head of the list of
Prague’s Communist friends
questionable in the new situation
whether he is still strong enough to
resist the existing anti-Soviet and pro-
gressive tendencies in the Hungarian
praesidium and, more important, in the
country at large.
In Prague there are now two main
topics of discussion: First, the im-
portant Communist Party congress to
be held in the city next month, and,
second, economic reorganisation. The
congress should establish Party Leader
Dubcek’s political base. If all goes well,
most of the remaining “conservatives”
against Dubcek’s peaceful revolution
will be weeded out of the central com-
mittee and Parliament.
The conservatives are to be found
both in the 100-man central committee
(perhaps 40 percent) and in the middle
layer of the administration. Liberal
Communists refer to them as the “fifth
column.” They have lost prestige after
the Russian backdown at Cierna last
week and are lying low. But they could
still cause trouble.
Czechoslovakia urgently needs a
massive hard-currency loan. The Rus-
sians have promised one, but it has yet
to be seen. The belief here is that after
the live-and-let-live decisions at Cierna,
the Russians will offer something just
before the Party congress next month
to achieve maximum political effect.
But, if not, Czechoslovakia might be
obliged to turn to the West.
There is hope of travel to the West.
A Communist factory boss said: “We
must learn from more contacts with the
West. I have been to Italy and Switzer-
land already. I want to go to other
places, too.”
The air is lightening. Workers are
relieved that the old-style trade union
bosses, remote, anonymous in their big
cars and police escorts, have gone.
Nevertheless, Czechoslovakia is not
turning into a multi-Party democracy.
There are two non-Communist organi-
sations and several political clubs and
they can ekpress their views openly.
But Parties or groups will not be
allowed to oppose the Party at national
level. Nor do they seek to do so.
SOUTH VIETNAM
BULLETS OR WORDS?
HANOI and the Viet Cong appear to
have reached a crossroads in their con-
duct of the war. The Vietnamese
Communists have chosen, or must soon
choose, between two alternatives. They
can either launch the so-called third
wave of their general offensive in the
spirit devised a year ago by General
Giap or they can turn to serious
negotiations.
The American military are leading
exponents of the theory that Hanoi
is still bent on war. Last week military
spokesmen said that they expected a
major country-wide attack toward the
end of the month, and possibly a minor
attack on Saigon by rocket and mortar
fire in a matter of days.
But it is not just the American
military who deny that there has been
any significant lull in the fighting, as
the North Vietnamese in Paris hinted
for the first time last week. Certainly
the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
units are still avoiding contact, but
Vietnamese military sources point out
that local Viet Cong are causing un-
usual trouble in areas round the capital
that used to be relatively quiet. There
is plenty of evidence that the Viet
Cong are still trying to cut off the
cities, above all Saigon, from the
countryside by sabotaging bridges and
roads. And the Viet Cong are also
weakening the Saigon Government by a
nation-wide program of assassinations.
These are exactly the activities laid
down last March by a meeting of the
Central Office of South Vietnam
(COSVN), the Viet Cong high com-
mand, which plotted the future course
of the “general offensive and uprising.”
The so-called sixth COSVN resolution


passed at this meeting made it plain
that such small-scale activities across
the country were the necessary base
from which dramatic large-scale
attacks were to be launched. Its over-
all message was to reaffirm the Giap
thesis that one can only fight, and not
negotiate, one’s way to true victory.
There is no firm evidence yet that
the relatively unproductive second Viet
Cong offensive of May and June has
forced any strategy modification.
Experts in Saigon believe that Hanoi
confidence may still be bolstered by
exaggerated reports of battlefield suc-
cesses, as well as the certainty that their
soldiers’ morale is far from cracking.
Then there is the case of the COSVN
meeting that is known to have taken
place in early July. American military
spokesmen saw this as a council of
war to work out plans for the next
attack. But in the absence of any hard
intelligence on the meeting, some
observers have another interpretation.
The arguments of people in Saigon
who believe that there has been a
significant lull in the fighting, or at
least that the Communists may be on
the brink of switching to serious negoti-
ations, are based more on scepticism
and intuition than indisputable fact.
There is, for a start, a growing disin-
clination among correspondents (and in
other more official quarters, both Viet-
namese and American) to accept the
American military’s figures on North
Vietnamese infiltrations. No one in
Saigon has convincingly explained how
the North Vietnamese managed in July
to send over four times as many men
south as in an average month a year
ago.
They point out that the sixth COSVN
resolution was passed before President
Johnson’s March 31 speech and the
agreement to talk in Paris. The July
meeting, however, may have discussed
these developments as well as drawn
some sobering conclusions from the
failure of the May-June offensive to
make a significant dent in the Saigon
Government.
There is also the intriguing coinci-
dence that the Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese were in position to launch
a major attack at the very time that
COSVN was deliberating. But that
attack never came off and the troops
later withdrew.
Both camps at least agree that the
next few weeks should prove con-
clusively which interpretation is cor-
rect. For the moment only Hanoi’s
leaders know if the next stage of the
war is to be fought with bullets or
words, and even they may not have
completely made up their minds.
ASEAN MEETING IN DJAKARTA
SMOOTHING OVER SABAH
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
AT ITS FIRST annual ministerial
meeting in Djakarta last week the
Association of South-East Asian Nations
managed to rise above the difficulties
and tensions created by the current
quarrel of two members, the Philip-
pines and Malaysia, over Sabah.
This was done by some diplomatic
sleight of hand which might, however,
prove an unsuccessful illusion. Meet-
ing outside the conference room
Malaysian Deputy Premier Tun Abdub
Razak and Philippines Foreign Minis-
ter Ramos discussed “the problems
arising from the Bangkok talks” and
decided that “as there was tension”
there should be a cooling-off period
after which the two countries would
consider and discuss “ways and means
of reconciliation.” Obviously this
patch-up is very far from being water-
tight.
President Suharto privately made it
abundantly clear that Indonesia con-
sidered ASEAN of much greater
significance and value than any terri-
torial ambitions of members, while
Thailand’s Foreign Minister Thanat
Khoman also privately made it equally
clear that the logic of the Sabah claim, '
if applied to the southern provinces of
Malaysia’s Tun Razak and
(r.) Philippines Foreign
Secretary Ramos with Thai
Foreign Minister Thanat
Khoman
Thailand or the northern States of
Malaysia, could easily produce other
ASEAN-wrecking issues.
Ramos emphasised that the organisa-
tion could not close its eyes to the
dispute “desirous as we are of
making ASEAN a success we cannot
and dare not ignore the fact that at the
present moment certain tensions fill
the air and certain strains and stresses
agitate the organisation.” For his part,
Tun Razak called for the grouping not
to be distracted by divisive forces
rooted in the colonial past which were
“completely irrelevant to the challenges
and needs of the present day.”
But if the two countries responded
to the other members’ desire for group
solidarity then they did so in a way
which brought a reconciliation of the
irreconcilables no nearer.
The acid test has been passed, but the
corrosive effect remains. Indeed, Razak
may well be criticised back in Kuala
Lumpur for merely postponing the day
of reckoning when every postponement
brings 1971 that much nearer.
Equally, the Malaysian reiteration
that their rejection of the Sabah claim
still stood and that there was no ques-
tion of reopening the Bangkok talks
left Ramos talking about future talks
and at the same time having to admit
that they were unlikely and un-
promised.
On the question of diplomatic rela-
tions the ASEAN conference made a
virtually unseen contribution to Malay-
sian-Philippines relations by deciding
to hold next year’s ministerial meeting
in Kuala Lumpur. This means that
during the next 12 months the standing
committee of ASEAN will be chaired
by the foreign minister of the next
host country (the Tunku) and com-
posed of the other four countries’ am-
bassadors in the Malaysian capital.
Contrary to the original plan, the
Philippines ambassador in K.L. and
all but one of his staff have not yet
withdrawn. If they are withdrawn now
it will of course be tantamount to
Filipino withdrawal from ASEAN.
Equally, if the withdrawal decision is
now reversed the Filipinos will be con-
ceding to the regional interest in a way
that they have not so far seemed will-
ing to do without having anything
to show for it vis-a-vis their claim to
Sabah. All of which would seem to
seriously limit President Marcos’ ability
to continue to blow both hot and cold
and would call for the determined
statesmanship which so far on this
question he has not appeared willing
to provide.
ASEAN gained perceptibly in sub-
stance during the week. A couple of
dozen small-scale projects involving no
specifically ASEAN expenditures were
selected for implementation. Four per-
manent committees on food production,
telecommunications, civil aviation, and
shipping were set up, plus an additional
ad hoc committee on financial matters.
More importantly, the five foreign
ministers got down to discussing frankly
the general security situation and
agreeing to further ministerial meetings
other than the annual one, should
circumstances dictate, with it being
understood that a sudden breakthrough
in the Paris peace negotiations almost
certainly would so dictate. Thus ASEAN


together has found, and is finding,
tangible expression. That expression
may still be slight, but certainly it is
not worth endangering.
SINGAPORE
RUGGED IN THE RAIN
IT WAS the “rugged society” with a
vengeance last week on Singapore’s
third National Day (August 9). No
sooner were all the marchers in the
National Day parade in place on the
central padang opposite the imposing
City Hall, with a large crowd watching
and the President and his Cabinet in
place on the City Hall steps, than the
monsoonal heavens opened as only they
can. Postponement? Cancellation? Not
a bit of it.
The parade proceeded as planned
and timed, with everybody getting
drenched. Soldiers from the four
battalions of Singapore’s Infantry Regi-
ment marched by as if they had just
come from the trenches, the colors of
some of the bands’ gay uniforms ran
into each other to produce a rainbow
effect, the white shirts and trousers of
the People’s Action Party Parliamen-
tarians became opaque.
Massed gymnasts performed in
unison in the padang’s mud, while the
traditional Chinese lion dances had
perhaps an extra zing as the dancers
strove to rid themselves of any chill.
If Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was
hoping for a symbolic illustration of the
PAP theme that Singapore must not be
deflected from its aim and purpose by
being a “soft society,” then this year’s
National Day well provided it.
Singapore’s grappling with economic
circumstances was the theme of Lee
Kuan Yew’s National Day message,
and he was able to report noteworthy
progress. “On our own we have done
better than in any three previous years
of our history,” he claimed, and pro-
duced numerous statistics to back up
this contention. “In the past 12 months
industrial output went up 21 percent.
External trade up nine percent. Cargo
handled up 15 percent. Income tax, at
the same rates as last year, up by 15
percent. Revenue from property tax
seven percent, liquor up eight percent,
tobacco up 12 percent. Public housing
and construction up 16 percent
14,500 units in the past 12 months, or
one unit every 36 minutes. Private
construction up 27 percent.”
The Prime Minister was also able
to point to the fact that GNP growth
“has exceeded nine percent per annum
for the past three years.” With popu-
lation increase down to 2.1 percent,
“this means ever-rising standards.”
But Mr. Lee did not let the figures
generate euphoria nor failed to mention
the central problem. Behind Singapore
looms the growing shadow of “the grow-
ing redundancies and the pull-out of
British Services’ expenditure in the final
phase of the rundown . . . Our main
problem has been, and will continue
to be, large unemployment in spite of
favorable economic growth.”
As, perhaps, befits a National Day
oration, Lee Kuan Yew said little about
the external challenge, contenting him-
self with observing that “we live in a
troublesome part of the world. Great
changes are taking place in and around
us.” His view was Singapore-centred—
“lf we give of our best, and nothing
less than the best will do, we can and
we shall overcome the problems the
future has in store for us.”
But on a day that forever reminds
of a neighbor’s inability to get on
with Singapore, and Singapore’s in-
ability to get on with a close neighbor,
there were no reminders of when what
the PAP leaders thought was their best
was definitely not good enough. Under-
standably enough, there was no men-
tion of how Singapore’s independence
was the direct product of Lee’s and
others’ lack of emotional and psycho-
logical preparedness to meet the chal-
lenge of a united Malaysia. It is, after
all, not only the rain that forces Singa-
pore to be rugged.
BIAFRA
"A LOT OF SURPRISES"
WHEN COLONEL OJUKWU finished
reading the 40-page harangue with
which Biafra opened its case before the
Addis Ababa peace conference last
week, Ethiopians, diplomats, and others
in the crowded public gallery of Africa
Hall broke into warm applause. The
next most audible sound in the vast
blue-and j beige chamber, however, was
the dull thud of illusions crumbling.
The secessionist leader’s impassioned
speech, a painstakingly documented re-
cital of why and how the former East-
ern Region had left Nigeria, effectively
cut the ground from under those who
had hoped to find a new willingness
to seek accommodation with Lagos. In-
stead, the Biafran stand boarded up
the few doors to settlement of the 13-
month-old civil war which had been
painfully inched open on earlier occa-
sions.
“Is it possible to imagine that our
Biafran demonstrators in London
last week
people would now be ready to accept
Nigerian rule?” Colonel Ojukwu asked.
“Against all the background of sus-
picion, hate, conflict, and war, our sur-
vival cannot be separated from the
sovereign independence of our State.”
He went on to say that no international
police force could reconcile the Ibos
to living under Nigerian rule. It would
depend on the Federal Government,
which could remove it at any time.
Finally he declared: “We will continue
to die in our thousands as we have done
in past years without help or support
from the international community.”
The conference appeared stalemated
after this uncompromising start. Colonel
Ojukwu’s Shakespearian delivery was
out of keeping with his earlier hints to
journalists that sovereignty was a con-
fusing word he preferred not to use
and that it might be “negotiable.”
Where Colonel Ojukwu had once en-
joyed the reputation among journalists
of being the most reasonable and
realistic of all Biafrans, he' treated the
conference to the inflammatory
rhetoric of his radio’s propaganda.
Nigeria’s delegates were taken com-
pletely aback by the performance. They
had thought the opening public session
would be an exchange of courtesies with
Emperor Haile Selassie, before the hard
and secret bargaining began. But
instead of continuing the slanging
match, as they did at Kampala, they
went ahead at midweek to present
their detailed, nine-point peace plan.
It offered a general amnesty to all but
the top secessionists, called for an
external force of Ethiopians, Indians,
and Canadians to police Biafran-held
territory along with largely Ibo units
of the Nigerian police, promised that
civilian administration of the east-
central State would be entirely in Ibo
hands, and promised to give jobs to Ibo
public servants.
More detailed and more accommo-
dating than the last Kampala proposals,
the Nigerian stand nevertheless con-
tinues to require Biafra to state its
acceptance of a reunited Nigeria. The
statement need not be a “grovelling
renunciation” of secession, Chief
Enahoro said, but he added, “I find it
difficult to foresee an immediate end
to our civil war unless we can agree
that we all belong to the same country.”
Where he was despondent, the
Biafran delegation was openly gleeful.
Its leader, who left for home 24 hours
later with his claque of supporters from
Gabon (which has already recognised
Biafra), had dramatically placed
Biafra’s case before what he called “the
disturbed conscience of the world.”
Biafran spokesmen, clearly emboldened
by France’s recent declaration of sup-
port, made it clear that their resolve
to fight on was stiffer than ever. “There
are a lot of surprises coming,” one
promised, referring, it seems, to the
persistent reports that Tunisia will
shortly grant diplomatic recognition.
Though the talks are still going on,
there seems very little room for com-
promise. The only question now is when
large-scale fighting is going to restart.


When are you dead?
Adjusting a five-channel monitor, which records the five
basic functions of the body, at Royal Alexandra Hospital,
Sydney
Sydney medical team at work on a kidney transplant. The
problem of the moment of death does not essentially arise
in this type of operation
By ROBERT RAYMOND
THERE WAS a time when death
whether inevitable or unannounced,
heroic or cowardly, dreaded or even
welcomed was at least final, could
be relied upon to be irreversible, and
might be pronounced by almost any-
one. .
Today the medical profession is
engaged in a running series of dialogues
(with watching briefs he d by awyers
and other guardians of society) to
attempt to define, so far without agree-
ment, the precise nature of death. Or,
to be even more precise, the moment
of death
This has, of course, been the subject
of extended, if not urgent, consideration
philosophical and theological, as
well as medical—for hundreds of years.
In the past, however, it was not all
that vital to be able to- decide the
exact moment when a persons body
££2 Zi t seSn E a Pr t hron a e
opening a will, or digging a grave, il
was only a matter of waiting long
enough for all signs of life to cease
Today, as everyone is now uncom-
fortably aware, a rather more precise
definition is urgently called for
because of the growing practice of
organ transplantation, and the obvi-
ous need, if such organs are to be
used at all, to harvest them as soon
as possible after the “death” of the
donor. The quotation marks round the
word death are necessary, for the
once-accepted connotations of finality
are no longer valid.
For the simple word ‘ death” must
now be substituted the by-no-means-
simple expression “death process” a
term which loosely describes the
gradual cessation of a number of bodily
functions over a period of time that
is still to be determined.
And where, on this fluctuating but
generally down-curving index, can one
rule the cut-off line?
It must, at this point, be admitted
that legal and theological definitions
of death are no help at all, especially
those which equate the moment of
death with the departure of the spirit.
It has been shown beyond doubt
that- a person with no apparent bodily
function (a condition sometimes called
“clinical death”) can be revived if
action is not too long delayed. The
heart, for example, can be restarted
by electric shock, massage, or chemical
stimulants. Did the spirit then depart
during the hiatus? Or does it await
some more specific notice to quit?
If, as seems more likely, the “soul”
is really the sense of awareness of the
individual, the consciousness of being
that originates in the brain, then the
moment of its severance from the
body is even more vague, since some
activity of the brain, of a slowly declin-
ing strength, has been shown to persist
for days after all other bodily functions
have ceased.
The legal interpretation is no more
helpful, for few, if any, countries have
legislation defining death. A person is
legally dead when a doctor says so,
and is prepared to sign a certificate to
that effect.
It must be to the medical profession,
then, that we turn for our new and
indisputable definition of the moment
of death. And this is where the difficul-
ties begin, because the doctors them-
selves do not, and apparently cannot,
agree on any such definition,
In Australia as elsewhere the
doctors most concerned in this problem
are those involved with organ trans-
plantation,
This new technique, perhaps the most
profoundly significant technical advance
in the history of medicine, has by its
very challenge and complexity attracted
some of the best doctors at our leading
hospitals—not only the surgeons, but
the physicians who prepare the patients
and care for them during the anxious
post-operative period; not only the
immunologists, who are trying to over-
come the rejection problem, but the
psychiatrists who help the patients to
learn to live beneath this Damoclean
swor d.
On a recent tour of the main hot,
p.tals engaged m transplantation, I
found the medical staffs very much
alive to the issue of defining death, and
prepared to discuss it at length,
The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
Adelaide has the only separate and
specially equipped kidney transplan-
tation unit in the country, and in fact
performed our first successful kidney
transplant three and a half years ago.
The renal physician is Dr. James
Lawrence, who set up the unit after
studying the work being done in Europe
and the United States,
I as k e d him the question that must
occur to him every time a kidney is
taken from a donor for one of his
patients: “When is a person dead


to the point that you can take the
organs?”
“I find it impossible to give you a
really precise and accurate answer to
this. I think that among generalisations
which we must think of in terms of
trying to define death is first of all
that death is very, very rarely a single
point in time.
“It is usually a process; that certain
organs, so to speak, can die before
other organs do. Clearly, although
traditionally the heart is the seat of our
emotions it really has nothing to do
with our emotions. It is our brain which
is really us, in a sense, and the brain
is a part of us which often dies first,
ceases to function before other viscera.”
“In an electrical sense?”
“In an electrical sense, and in a
kind of day-to-day sense of thinking
and being and feeling. Now, those of
us who were doctors in the past have
been used to accepting cessation of
heartbeat as being death. Quite clearly,
this was convenient, and while it re-
mained convenient it was a reasonable
thing to do. But now, in this new era,
we’ve got to re-look at this.”
Dr. John Stewart is the renal
physician in charge of the transplant
unit at Sydney Hospital (the only unit
so far to have attempted a liver trans-
plant).
I asked Dr. Stewart about the ethical
problems of establishing the moment
of death.
“Yes, this does present problems,
but not with kidney transplantations.
Death occurs when the heart stops, and
the breathing stops, and this is checked
by independent doctors and rechecked
before any move is made to remove
the kidneys for grafting.
“The problem arises with cardiac
transplantation, because the public is
quite aware that the heart, when it
stops, can be revived; and if the heart
stops in the body of one patient and
can be revived in the body of another,
then they can rightfully wonder why
it was not revived in the body of the
original patient.
“The donation of a heart, therefore,
has its difficulties, which arise from
pronouncing the donor dead before
taking the heart out. And it’s not until
this is thoroughly resolved that cardiac
transplantation will be able to go ahead
without worries.”
At Royal Melbourne Hospital, which
has carried out the greatest number of
kidney transplants in Australia (all
from cadaver donors), I talked to Mr.
Peter Morris, one of the senior surgeons
in the transplant field.
He made it clear that the core
of the problem lies in the disposal, as
the determining factor of life and
death, of that now discredited but still
emotionally powerful symbol, the
beating heart.
“It happens that the heart can keep
beating for a time with its own in-
trinsic rhythm after death has occured
and I’m using death in this con-
text as being cerebral death, the death
of the brain, without any possibility
of recovery.
“The heart may beat on with its
own spontaneous rhythm for an hour or
more. Hearts from animals have been
kept beating in a dish for 24 hours
without any connection with the origi-
nal host at all.
“One must remember that the heart
is really just a very simple muscular
pump, and if it’s fed with the right
nutrients it will keep beating.”
What Mr. Morris is referring to is
the heart’s self-sustaining cycle of
activity. Because of its importance to
the whole organism in circulating the
blood-borne requirements of meta-
bolism, the heart has been made as
nearly autonomic as evolution can
manage.
Its pumping rate can be influenced
by nervous activity within the brain
(fear, anger, desire), and external
factors (temperature changes), but the
electrical stimulus which triggers each
contraction arises within the heart itself,
in a mysterious group of sensing cells in
the wall of the right upper chamber.
By some process still not fully under-
stood, these cells the sinus node
are charged up (to discharge at regular
intervals) by two main stimuli associ-
ated with the bloodstream: chemical
messengers, such as adrenalin, and the
actual pressure of the blood itself within
the heart.
This being so, it is not difficult to
understand how the heart can con-
tinue to beat spontaneously, after the
brain has ceased to communicate with
the body, and after other organs have
ceased to function provided there
is an adequate supply of blood to main-
tain pressure within the circulatory
system.
This, then, is the basis of the propo-
sition that in itself the heart beat offers
an unreliable guide to the state of the
organism as a whole, and no guide at
all to the cut-off point in the process
of dying, beyond which the body’s
recovery cannot take place.
Even if, lacking the above stimuli
to the sinus node, the heart does stop
completely, it can sometimes be re-
started by external stimuli.
These techniques today include car-
diac massage (both external, by
rhythmic pressure on the breastbone,
and internal, by opening the chest),
electric shock, by touching it with
electrodes, and chemical stimuli in
the form of drugs, such as digitalis.
Once kicked into action, and with
adequate blood available to maintain
pressure, the heart may regain its own
intrinsic beat again quite indepen-
dently of any control from the brain.
One important factor in this delicate
electrico - chemico - hydrodynamic
equation, however, is the presence of
oxygen, which is required by the heart
muscle itself. And the oxygenation of
the blood by the lungs is not by any
means independent of the brain; respir-
ation, whether we are asleep or awake,
Dr. Philip Blaiberg, South African
he art-transplant survivor, surrounded by
bottles of drugs and other medication
which are his daily lot
is controlled by nervous impulses from
the brain.
The lungs can, however, be artifici-
ally ventilated by a fairly simple air
pump, so that even in the absence of
any connection with the brain they can
be made to oxygenate the blood, and
in turn help to keep the heart beat-
ing.
And this is where the old, “con-
venient” distinction between life and
death becomes hopelessly blurred; is a
person whose breathing and heart-
beat are being maintained artificially
alive or dead? This question is the crux
of the current “crisis of ethics” that
faces transplant surgery.
The case of the first human heart
transplant, in South Africa in Decem-
ber, 1967, illustrates this ethical
dilemma, and is worth recalling in
detail (some of which tended to be
overlooked in the excitement).
Louis Washkansky was dying in
Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town
from an incurably failing heart, when,
on Saturday afternoon, December 2,
Miss Denise Darvall, aged 25, was
brought in after being struck by a car.
The doctors who examined Miss Darvall
found very severe injuries. Her pelvis
had been smashed, and her skull
damaged, so that the nerve centres at
the back of the brain that controlled
her breathing and blood pressure were
“irreparably” damaged.
But Miss Darvall’s heart was un-
harmed; driven by its own built-in
“pacemaker” (the sinus node), it was
still beating—although beginning to
falter as a result of failing respiration
and falling blood pressure.
Three important actions were then
taken, the order of which the reports
do not make clear: Dr. Christiaan Bar-
nard and his brother, Marius, were
notified that a potential donor existed
for the operation that they had been
planning for some time; the unconscious
Miss Darvall was supplied with a
respirator which took over the job of


her lungs, by pumping air into them
through a tube in her throat; and Miss
Darvall’s father was asked for permis-
sion to transplant her heart, which he
granted.
Disregarding, for the moment, the
condition of Miss Darvall’s brain at
this time, it is clear that by Saturday
night her breathing and heartbeat were
being primarily maintained by the
respirator, plus drugs to provide a
chemical stimulus to the heart.
This situation continued until the
early hours of Sunday morning, while
tests were carried out to see how well
Miss Darvall’s tissues matched those of
Louis Washkansky. (They showed a
good degree of compatibility.)
At 2.15 a.m. Miss Darvall was pro-
nounced “dead”; her heart had stopped
beating. Her chest was immediately
opened and her heart connected to a
heart-lung machine, which perfused it
with cooled, oxygenated blood to keep
it in good condition. Meanwhile,
Washkansky was being prepared for the
transplant which followed. At the con-
clusion of the operation Miss Darvall’s
heart was restarted in Washkansky by
an electric shock.
The “Newsweek” correspondent in
Cape Town, John Barnes, asked the
surgical team whether Miss Darvall had
been taken off the respirator before her
heart stopped, but reports that he could
not get an answer. “That is an imperti-
nent question,” said one of the surgeons
(not named). “We took full resuscita-
tive measures until the time of death.”
Since then nearly 30 heart transplants
have been performed, by many different
surgeons, and under widely differing
conditions—but some questions arising
from the very first transplant, and
echoed in the circumstances surrounding
some of the later operations, have
worried and divided the medical pro-
fession (and the public) ever since.
Was Miss Darvall “alive,” in any real
sense, while her lungs were being
inflated by a respirator in order to keep
her heart beating? If so, could she
have been maintained any longer, had
not Washkansky been lying waiting in a
nearby operating theatre?
If, on the other hand, her brain
had been so damaged that she had
already “died” earlier that night,
would not the surgeons have been
justified, when all else was ready, in
removing the respirator? (If indeed
they did so.)
Most doctors would instinctively re-
ject the suggestion that resuscitative
measures should ever be withdrawn as
part of the process of obtaining organs
for transplantations; the implications
are unacceptable.
But situations undoubtedly arise in
which a patient with severe brain
damage from an accident may be lying
in a deep coma, supported by mech-
anical aids, in a state of what has
been called “living death.” Such a
person cannot recover unaided, ancj yet
will not “die” until the machines
are switched off. In fact, the decision
to withdraw such aids in these circum-
stances is continually being taken in
hospitals everywhere, when the
physician in charge is satisfied that re-
covery is impossible.
Such inevitable decisions did not
unduly disturb the profession (or
society, for that matter) until the
question of removing organs arose
and, what is even more contentious,
the need to remove such organs as
soon as the donor is pronounced dead.
This is necessary because present
methods for keeping organs in usable
condition do not yet match the sur-
gical techniques of transplantation.
Even the now developing technique
of preserving organs in situ after death
is, in fact, a subtle variation of the
much-disputed method of keeping an
unconscious patient “alive” with a
respirator.
This new technique is described by
Dr. Don Gengos, a cardiac surgeon
at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children, in Sydney a man whose
skills, developed by study abroad and
practice here, may one day lead him
into the field of heart transplantation.
“I think we will develop techniques
Christiaan Barnard
Denton Cooley
Norman Shumway
for storing kidneys and livers outside
the body for some time, but I doubt
if we will ever attempt to store the
heart for long probably not more
than 1 an hour. It is more likely that
when it is acknowledged that there
is a potential donor progressing , to-
ward death a rapid form of death,
say from an accident we would have
the mechanism prepared ready to bring
into action at the time of death.
“By connecting a fairly simple type
of heart-lung machine to an artery and
a vein in the groin the body could be
given the support to the organs that
would be needed to stop their decay
process. This circulation would not
reach the entire body and could in
no way return that patient to life
but only the vital organs. Then, by
cooling down the circulation, you could
extend the preservation time of the
heart to perhaps two hours or more.
“If the transplant centre was well
enough organised, and the program
well enough set up, you could then
take the heart, liver, and two kidneys,
and serve four patients.”
It is against this background, and
in the shadow of continuing doubts
about the precise circumstances of
“harvesting” organs from bodies, that
the medical world is seeking a new
definition of death that will safeguard
the donor, benefit the recipient, pro-
tect the doctor, satisfy the law, and
reassure the public.
And the definition that seems to
offer the best prospect of meeting these
almost irreconcilable conditions is that
of “cerebral death.” This term has it-
self yet to be defined with any pre-
cision, but broadly it means a total
and permanent cessation of brain
activity. (And even in that sentence
the meaning of the words “total,” “per-
manent,” and “cessation” is still in
dispute.)
There are two important indicators
of the level of brain activity in an
unconscious person, both of which
would need to be taken into account
in any definition of cerebral death:
the presence of reflexes in various parts
of the body, and the emanation of
electrical impulses from the brain itself.
The reflexes include certain muscular
reactions to external stimuli (ranging
from a tap on the sole of the foot to
the shining of a light into the eyeball),
caused by return signals from the lower
neurological centres in the brain,
The absence of such reflexes, which
depend in no way upon any conscious
effort in the higher centres of the ’brain,
indicates that the “death” of the
brain, or the cessation of its activity,
has begun to spread downward from
the apex of the nervous system, the
cerebral cortex, where the individual’s
most profound thought processes take
place,
Since 1929 it has been possible to
estimate the level of activity in various
areas of the brain by a much more
direct method the use of the electro-
encephalogram, or EEG. This is simply
a recording of the rhythmic waves of
electricity continually generated by the
living brain.

but when large numbers of cells dis-
charge in step, so to speak, the result-

connected to the scalp. The variations
in current are amplified about a million
times, whereupon they become strong

connected to various areas of the sca’p,
together produce an EEG; normally,
this consists of certain basic wave forms,
which can be related to different levels
of brain activity. The interpretation of
EEGs in living brains is still a new
and highly specialised branch of medi-
cine, depending as it does upon fairly
crude electrical apparatus.
However, the absence of any wave
pattern at all from a brain a so-
called “flat” EEG, with pens drawing
straight lines would appear to per-
mit of only one interpretation: that the
brain in question had ceased to func-
tion. And this manifestation is, in fact,
the basis of all proposed definitions of
“cerebral death.”
The appeal of this criterion is in-
stantly obvious: it removes the onus
of judgment from the field of human
fallibility; the human observer is re-
lieved of the possibility of confusion
between the subjective and objective
interpretation of muscular reflexes and
similar organic signs.
Unfortunately—and this is why no
generally acceptable definition of cere-
bral death has yet been devised even
a flat EEG is not, per se, conclusive, for
precisely the same reason that makes
the heartbeat unacceptable as an in-
dicator of death: the brain itself, like
the body, dies in parts. Cerebral death
is a continuous process, not a moment
in time.
In life, the unceasing electrical
activity of the brain demands a much
larger supply of oxygen from the blood
than any comparable area of the body
about 20 percent of the available
oxygen. A person whose blood flow to
the head is cut off—for example, by
squeezing the carotid arteries in the
sides of the neck blacks out in a few
seconds.
If the blood supply to the brain is
suddenly interrupted, the nerve cells
of the brain begin ceasing to function
within minutes of being deprived of
oxygen and, as far as is known, this
process is irreversible. Cerebral death,
under these conditions, is rapid, and
unarguable.
In most cases, however, this is not
the sequence of events. Generally, in
a dying person, there is a gradual fall
in the supply of oxygen to the brain,
through declining respiration and heart-
beat (and even these losses may be
slowed by the use of supporting
machines).
A variety of changes will thus be
taking place in the brain. Groups of
cells will be ceasing to function at dif-
ferent rates. Some areas may have
become totally inactive, while others
continue to function like patches of
light left shining in a city suffering
progressive power failure.
But surely, one is entitled to ask,
when all the lighted patches in the city
have gone black, is not that final?
When the EEG is at last perfectly flat,
is not that the end of all thought, con-
sciousness, mental activity the end,
in fact, of Me?
This, however, is not always the case.
For even after the EEG has been per-
fectly flat for some hours, the brain
can begin to function again, and even
recover its normal (and immense)
capability. Precisely how and why this
happens, no one is quite sure but
it has been observed many times.
In some cases of barbiturate poison-
ing, for example, or after long exposure
to extreme cold, the EEG may be flat
for four hours or more before waves
begin to reappear.
The implications of this unfold
endlessly, like the tape emerging from
an EEG machine monitoring the last
hours of a prospective heart donor.
A flat EEG (for a variable period)
is the common denominator in most
definitions of cerebral death being
advanced at present, but there is no
universal agreement about the length
of time that it should remain flat. The
proposed periods range from a few
minutes up to the 48 hours asked for
by the French National Academy of
Medicine.
In West Germany, the dispute
recently came out into the open at the
Federal Republic North-West Con-
ference for Specialists in Internal
Diseases, held at Hamburg University.
Dr. Walter Bushart, a neurologist, and
Dr. Peter Rittmeyer, an anaesthetist,
jointly presented a paper on “the
criteria of death in the light of modern
therapeutic possibilities,” which caused
a certain uneasiness among the audience
of doctors.
According to their researches, they
said, they had to reject the suggestion
of the Federal Republic Surgeons’
Association that “biological death”
could be assumed in the absence of
breathing, heart activity, circulation,
pupil reaction, and a flat EEG for
twelve hours.
“Even after the EEG has registered
no electrical impulses for two days, we
have observed cases of complete res-
titution, and after a further pause of 24
hours a recurrence of spontaneous
breathing.”
This information, they said, was to
make doctors think before adopting
“over-hasty” criteria of death.
Another and better-known group of
doctors who have been thinking and
talking about this very problem are
the heart-transplant surgeons them-
selves. Eleven of the surgeons in
the world who have performed this
bold operation met last month in Cape
Town to compare notes and discuss
the future.
Their spokesman, after the closed
conference, was Dr. Denton Cooley, of
Houston, Texas, who has three surviv-
ing heart-transplant patients out of five,
including one, an accountant, already
going back to work. He was asked if
the group had agreed upon a defini-
tion of death.
“On three criteria,” said Dr. Cooley,
“there is general agreement: there
must be no natural heartbeat, respira-
tion, or reflexes. Beyond that, he must
have a flat EEG.”
“But for how long?” was the inevit-
able question. And Dr. Cooley could
only report that the group had reached
“some agreement as to the nature of
brain death.”
In Australia a special committee of
the Federal Health and Medical
Research Council (the top medical
advisory body in the country) has been
hearing submissions from both doctors
and laymen on this question.
Something definite was hoped for
from last week’s World Medical Asso-
ciation Assembly in Sydney, made up
of more than 200 doctors from many
countries. The ethics committee was,
however, obliged to report that even
after many hours of debate it could
not agree on a definition.
One way or the other, that new and
indisputable definition of death will
have to be produced, if only to keep
public opinion in step with, and to
maintain official support for, the irre-
sistible surge forward in transplantation
which is taking place all over the
world.
Many doctors are concerned that
this redefinition might be arrived at
without sufficient thought. In the words
of Dr. James Lawrence in Adelaide:
“Quite clearly, in relooking at this
we’ve got to retain the confidence of
people. I think it’s vitally important
for people to realise that this is being
done in a realistic way. One of the
things that everyone involved in this
sort of procedure is very determined
about is that the therapy of the poten-
tial donor shall not be interfered with
in any way by the fact that this person
is in danger of death.”
Certainly, the world seems to be
doing its best to help the transplant
doctors. Official opposition to heart
transplants in New South Wales and
Victoria has crumbled. In the United
States the National Conference of
Commissioners of Uniform State
Laws is drafting legislation to enable
people to donate their organs £>y will
(traditionally, a body belongs to the
next of kin, and may not be touched
without their permission).
In Britain, a Bill has been intro-
duced into Parliament to amend the
Human Tissues Act 1961, which also
forbids the removal of organs without
the consent of' the next of kin. The
new Bill would permit organs to be
removed unless there is reason to
believe that the deceased would have
objected.
It is now up to the doctors to agree
among themselves on what they mean
when they say we’re dead. Most
people expect to have only one life,
and they are reluctant to think of being
counted out while there is the tiniest
spark of it still flickering.
They do not fear decisions left to
famous doctors in well-equipped and
perfectly run hospitals. What they do
sometimes wonder about, however, is
what might have to be decided in a
bad hospital at 4 a.m. by a tired and
inexperienced resident with a touch of
the flu.


Coming up from
underground: the
young film-makers
THE LIGHTS went up in the theatre
and a dark-haired young man turned
to face the audience. The audience was
immediately afflicted with an epidemic
of the nervous mannerisms of a group
of people suddenly called upon en
masse to give opinions.
Frank Heimans, alias Cinetel Film
Production Service, was in an un-
enviable position. He’d just screened his
film, “Shades of Difference,” for the
first time in front of an audience, and
he was now inviting questions and
criticism. Through the coughs and the
feet shuffling, he asked the subjects of
the film, painters Col Jordan and
Michael Dulics, to join him on the
platform.
People looked confused. Should they
ask about the film or about the work of
the artists? Most plumped for art. Film,
it seems, is still a difficult medium to
talk about.
But one man got to his feet, asked
the cost of the film, and sat down again.
“$2500.”
“Who will be interested in buying it?”
asked someone else.
But Heimans was frank and
unabashed. He couldn’t hope to recover
the cost in Australia, he said, so the
film was aimed at the international
market. A 21-minute film shot in color,
it examines, through their paintings,
their own comments, and the comments
of others, the contrasting techniques
and beliefs of the two painters.
“Perhaps you could take a shot of
Col smoking a Rothmans and sell it
as a commercial,” was another viewer’s
suggestion.
“I would burn the film before it were
sold for a commercial.” This was
Dulics, whose copybook anger about
commercialism had just been spelt out
very explicitly on the screen.
But Jordan was more tolerant about
it. “Why not have business organisa-
tions subsidise it? After all, they’re the
only patrons around.”
Heimans had actually financed the
film with money earned from the pro-
duction of television commercials, and
although it suffers from faults in the
sound, some preciousness in the narra-
tive, and one of those excruciatingly
pretentious scenes in which people sit
around drinking i'ed wine and talking
about art it is infinitely preferable to
the Commonwealth Film Unit’s “man
and machine” epics and the travelogues
which now form part of our basic
diet of cinema shorts.
Heimans and cameraman Mike
Franklin filmed “Shades of Difference”
last year after Heimans read an art
critic’s comparison of the two painters’
concurrent exhibitions in Sydney.
Despite its bouts of selfconsciousness, it
does achieve what it sets out to do:
talk about art in a way to interest
people who don’t go to exhibitions. But
Heimans is not optimistic about its sale.
Arthur Karvan, a 24-year-old busi-
nessman who is financing film-makers
Albie Thoms and Chris McCullough
in their newly formed company, Screen
Associates, thinks the Commonwealth
Government should intervene to require
local cinemas to show local films as
supporting features. Meanwhile, Screen
Associates will be showing their new
half-hour film, “Vision of a New Life,”
to the ABC, in addition to looking for
an overseas buyer.
In contrast to the theatre people’s
excited rumblings of curiosity about the
Australian Council’s plans for them, the
film-makers I spoke to are refreshingly
sceptical about any reported scheme for
Government subsidies for film. Chris
McCullough, advocating self-help,
evinced fears of bureaucracy’s part in
grants and subsidies and fears of an
artificial start to the Australian film
industry.
“Older people cling to the subsidy
idea because they haven’t got the
enthusiasm to stimulate their own
interest,” he said. “We can’t hope to
compete with the story-telling power of
Hollywood or the art-house business of
Europe. We have to make films with
our own outlook, otherwise there’s no
reason for an Australian film industry.”
But then McCullough and Thoms
have had the luck to find Arthur
Karvan, a former accountant who has
made a successful business out of buying
and restoring terrace houses. Between
telephone calls, Karvan, elegant in
white polo-neck sweater and well-
fitting corduroys, talked of the begin-
nings of the partnership.
“I’d been a friend of Albie’s for a
long time, and I was having dinner with
him and Chris one night, listening to
them talk about this film for a while,
then realised the only missing factor
was me. No, I haven’t been especially
interested in films before, but I had to
do something out of all this.” And he
waved a vague hand.
He has opened the Screen Associates
David Perry ... “my kind of thinking
is disconnected from everybody’s reality”
office in a building he owns in
Woollahra, Sydney. The decor is what’s
known as “restrained,” and the dis-
tinctively casual look of the partners
(long hair and corduroys) is slightly
at variance with the linen-textured walls
and the pickled-wood furniture.
Karvan is resigned to the fact that
this first film won’t make money, but
he’s convinced Australian films have a
profitable future ahead of them that,
coming from an accountant, is hearten-
ing.
“Vision” is Chris McCullough’s idea,
inspired, he says, by a dream in which
he found his own body. “It worried me
for months, then it jelled into this.
I wrote the script as an exercise, not
intending to make it, until I showed it
to Albie, who liked it.
“There’s no dialogue, and it has a
doubtful time sequence, which you can
take as progressive or in sections, as
thoughts going on in people’s minds.
I wanted to make it more visual than
spoken. The films that have always
interested me most have been those I
didn’t understand at the time, like
‘Marienbad.’ Inexplicable films which
aren’t relying on symbolism, but are
appealing in a psychological way as
well as an emotional one. They don’t
use tricky effects, just plain use of
camera and techniques, but they appeal
on several levels.”
For this film, McCullough is director
and editor, while Thoms is producer,
which means he controls the budget
available to them and, theoretically, is
able to give judgments on certain
aspects of the film from a more
detached point of view than McCul-
lough’s. “It hasn’t worked quite that
way this time,” McCullough said,

“because the film is so personal for me
that I’ve gone straight ahead on it.”
Some of the underground film-makers
draw the charge of amateurism because
they’ve side-stepped the conventional
training grounds in favor of instinct
and trial and error, springing from the
wish to convey an idea. But Thoms
and McCullough have been through the
classic film mills: an ABC-TV trainee-
ship in Thoms’ case and four years with
Cinesound and the Commonwealth
Film Unit for McCullough.
McCullough, at any rate, is hardly
an underground film-maker, since he
has worked previously on television and
film documentaries and has never been
moved by the experimental hand-made
films essayed so enthusiastically by the
underground.
“My experimental films have only
been personal exercises to see if a par-
ticular method will work in a larger
concept,” he said. “I don’t think the
McLuhan idea is going to last, anyway.
You can be clever with film just hold-
ing it in your hand. But the value of
it is to be able to work it out and justify
its use.
“A film-maker should be correlating
his impressions, even if he’s just walk-
ing up the road. I’m a great one for
messages and for using film as a real
medium for communication.”
Since leaving the Commonwealth
Film Unit to work as a freelance dir-
ector, McCullough has made a Project
’66 documentary on disc jockey Ward
Austin, “T h e Combination,” an
Impact documentary about jockey
George Moore and horse trainer
Tommy Smith, and a film about
mission work in the South Pacific
(which was co-sponsored by a naviga-
tion company and the Methodist Over-
seas Mission). There have also been
things which haven’t succeeded. He was
three-quarters of the way through a
documentary for the Pacesetters series
when the subject, cameraman Mike
Molloy, broke both legs skiing, and
he has devoted six months to writing
two feature film scripts he has been
unable to sell.
But the present is stimulating, his
mind split between “Vision” and
“Thunderbolt,” an attempt in the art
of the dramatised documentary.
He has almost completed “Thunder-
bolt” for TCN9’s Special Projects
Division from an idea he formulated
last year on holiday in Armidale, in
northern New South Wales. He put
it to Bob Raymond, a contact made
from his Project ’66 documentary.
Raymond agreed to it and McCullough
then spent a month researching
material on the life of the bushranger.
“It’s a tremendously complicated
story, because there have been so many
conflicting reports,” he said.
There were other problems, too. He
spent another month touring N.S.W.
in a desperate search for a stretch
of untouched land for filming, and
finding hardly a square mile without
a telegraph wire, a fence, or a road.
The houses he wanted to use for
interiors just didn’t exist, so he finally
had to compromise and film inside
Vaucluse House. “But a major effort
has gone into props and costumes
with antique pistols, original police
uniforms, and so on. It’s surprising how
well it works. The rest has been done
around Armidale.”
It was the first time he’d worked
with actors, and the cast was so large
compared with the camera crew that
he felt they were like “fleas handling
elephants.” “It was overpowering, but
you have to stick your neck out in
something like this and do it.”
Albie Thoms has also experienced
the elation of directing a large-scale
production four episodes of ABC-
TV’s series “Contrabandits,” something
he likens to directing a feature film
overnight. “You feel very confident
when you’re in control of a film with
a budget of SIO,OOO in contrast with
experimental films. But when I started
work on the second series it was like
going over old ground.”
After starting at the ABC three
years ago as trainee, Thoms was
promoted to the job of assistant direc-
tor on the comedy series “Nice ’n
Juicy,” then to director after just 18
months in television. “I’d fulfilled my
part of the bargain, but I was still
getting paid less than the cameramen
and other people working for me.
“There’s still this attitude that
artists’ work isn’t work although
that’s changing,” he said. “But at the
moment, the administration people pay
themselves adequately while the artists
suffer.”
Thoms, one of the initiators of ÜBU,
the film-makers’ co-operative which
arranges the distribution of under-
ground films, has been a determined
innovator since his university days
when he worked with the Sydney Uni-
versity Dramatic Society.
In 1963, he produced his first film,
directed by Bruce Beresford and des-
cribed with a touch of euphemistic sym-
bolism in an ÜBU Press release as the
depiction of “a society untroubled by
unusual fallout which results in their
destruction.” Titled “It Droppeth as
the Gentle Rain,” it was actually about
a group of people buried in a storm of
excrement unleashed in an inexorable
stream from the skies.
Although based bn a ballet scenario
by Jacques Prevert, which Thoms used
in an experimental theatre production,.
“Revue of the Absurd,” it was a little
too much for the N.S.W. Police Force,
which prevented its screening. Never-
theless, it has since been shown in all
States despite a Commonwealth Cen-
sor ban.
The Commonwealth Film Censor has
exhibited unflagging suspicion in regard
to ÜBU’s activities since they began
and many of the productions bear
censorship bans like rather proudly won
but inexplicable battle scars.
“I think they regard us as a sort of
backyard business with connotations of
‘blue’ films,” one film-maker says. “As


a consequence, we get pulled up for
things which would easily pass if they
were in commercial films.”
Thoms made further films, inspired
by his experiments in theatre, while he
worked for his M.A. and formed a
theatre company which presented plays
and a revue in the city.
After running out of money, he took
a job with the Elizabethan Trust
managing a lunchtime theatre network
in the suburbs, became involved in
independent theatre productions pre-
sented in the open air at the Warringah
Mall, then joined the ABC.
He has made a number of films for
ÜBU, many of them hand-made films,
others relying on camera techniques
for abstract or surrealistic effects, and
most no more than a few minutes long.
The best known is “Blunderball,” a 21-
minute burlesque of the James Bond
films. But others have been shown at
film festivals, both here and overseas,
and Thoms’ 50-second color film, “Man
and His World,” was chosen for
exhibition at Expo.
“Most films are made without
thought of being seen, but some have
been seen in other countries through co-
operatives in London, San Francisco,
and Canada. The co-op takes 25 per-
cent of the profit, leaving 75 percent
to the film-maker.
“But films cost so much to produce
that it takes years to get the money
back. It’s now two years since we
made ‘Blunderball,’ and we’ve just
covered costs. ‘Man and His World’
cost SSOO, although it was so short, and
there’s still about S4OO to be recovered.
But I expected the cost to be high,
because I used a lot of experimental
techniques, including a split screen.”
The Press release listing Thoms’ films
is hardly sufficient impetus to in-
vite interest in his experimental work.
For instance, a summary of his 14-
minute film, “Bolero,” a finalist in the
prestigious International Experimental
Film Competition, makes it sound about
as riveting as a fly’s progress up a
wall:
“It simulates a single tracking shot
to Ravel’s music, in which the camera
travels for 14 minutes down a street,
ending in a close-up of Bronwyn
Stevens-Jones’ eye.”
However, conversation with Thoms
about his intentions in experimentation
makes more sense.’ “I don’t want to
make story films for ÜBU, because they
don’t increase my knowledge. At first
we got the Film Festival lot along to
our screenings, but they didn’t like
them, because the films have no literary
content. But now we get people who
like abstract paintings and modern
music and the kids who’ve grown up
with the fast-cutting in 30-second com-
mercials. They find the electronic
tricks we use exciting. We also put on
light shows for the discotheque audi-
ences. I think in 20 years’ time, when
the young audience is the general audi-
ence, film will be completely different.”
David Perry, who works by day in
the engineering department of the ABC
doing technical research into the uses
of film in television, has the scien-
tifically orientated man’s delight in
McLuhanism and is devoted to experi-
mentation in his films. But he doesn’t
have Thoms’ optimism about their
future.
“I’d love to be able to make a living
out of them, but I’m resigned to the
fact that my kind of thinking is too
disconnected from everybody’s reality.
There are a few people in each audience
who think abstract films are the only
ones worth watching, but I don’t think
wide acceptance will ever come.
“I’m resigned to the fact and I don’t
feel too bitter about it. But I do look
forward to the time when what I know
will be useful to the people making
films here.”
Perry, who is also a still photog-
rapher, can’t remember a time when
he didn’t own a camera of some kind,
and at 16 was making tentative experi-
ments with an 8-millimetre movie
camera. He went to New Zealand to
work on a farm for a time, took a job
as a printer when he returned to Aus-
tralia, then went to the ABC as a
film-processing technician.
He was working with film all day and
it had to have an effect. The result
was “Swansong in Birdland,” an
animated film made painstakingly at
home from discarded film stock. At
that time, none of his friends was a
film-maker, so there was no one to give
advice. He drew all the characters,
photographed them, photographed a
static background, and rephotographed
the shapes, winding the camera back-
ward.
But later he met Albie Thoms, with
whom he worked on several experi-
mental films. He learned editing by
watching other films and profiting by
his accidents and mistakes, and in 1966
made his most ambitious film, “The
Tribulations of Mr. Dupont No More,”
with Michael Boddy as Mr. Dupont. It
cost S6OO to make, about a third of
which has so far been recovered. Perry
calls it a series of escape fantasies, and,
looking back on it now, says it wasn’t
funny enough. “It was too personal, I
think the humor wasn’t accessible
enough.”
His last film was a three-minute color
film woven round the work of painter
Keith Luby, and he’s now making an
abstract film created from shifting pat-
terns of light playing on different sur-
faces. This is in black and white, but
increasing experience of the subtleties
of color film is making him impatient
of using anything else.
“People are beginning to realise it
can produce effects they didn’t believe
it was capable of. And printing
techniques can be used on it to bring
about almost magical changes. Some
of them have been used in a commer-
cial film for the first time by the tech-
nicians working for John Huston on
his film ‘Reflections in a Golden Eye.’
I’m waiting to see it now to know
properly how they’ve been done.”
Film is probably the most daunting
medium of all for self-expression. Its
cost is prohibitive and the film-maker,
unless he’s working on a hand-made
film, is dependent on a multitude of
maybes for success.
A writer or a painter has only him-
self to contend with, but, in addition
to the uncertainty of his own inspira-
tion, a film-maker has to wait until
people, equipment, weather, and loca-
tion harmonise to suit his purpose.
Even then, film-making without the
maximum equipment is a series of
compromises.
But some of the films distributed by
ÜBU have been made by people with-
out technical knowledge who were
simply attracted by film as a means
toward self-expression.
Jeanette Grant-Thompson was a
student at Queensland University when
she first saw short films without
dialogue being made by other students.
“I used to write and I often thought
my ideas would go better in film, but
it always seemed too impractical.
“I didn’t think of no-dialogue shorts
until a friend made one. Then I
thought I’d jump in.”
Another friend shot the film for her,
she borrowed a projector and edited
it at home between studies for her
final Arts examinations. She learned
as she went, and when she came to
Sydney early this year she added a
soundtrack. The film was distributed
through ÜBU and shown at the Syd-
ney Film Festival.
Jeanette goes so far as to describe
the film, “In an Onion,” as a “character
study of a neurotic girl” but isn’t will-
ing to say much more about it. “The
critics said all there was to say about
it at the time. It wasn’t a good film,
but I learned a lot from it. It’s funny
that when I was making it someone
asked me if I wasn’t biting off more
than I could chew. And I said I
couldn’t bite off any less. I’ve changed
my mind about that.”
After “In an Onion,” she started
work on a short experimental abstract
film and has now teamed with two
cameramen who are anxious to make a
film if she’ll supply the idea and direct
it—the film-maker’s ideal situation.
As actors, Jeanette is using two
people she has met at acting classes
at the Ensemble Theatre. Although
she has worked out the film’s main
theme, she says a lot will be improvisa-
tion. This time, she stresses, the theme
will be simple, the film no longer than
ten minutes. “And, in brief, it’s about
the breaking down of an illusion.”
She is 22, small, large-eyed, and
peculiarly free of any ambitions about
the future of her film-work, with no
desire for a career in any emergent
film industry.
“If my time was my own, I’d love
to work on films full-time. But I
never want to work on films which
don’t interest me.”
So the Australian film industry may
not exist and a lot of people may not
even want it to, but Australian film-
makers are alive and trying—under-
ground and elsewhere.

The end of Macquarie Street
THE FURORE over the N.S.W. State
Government’s plan to demolish Sydney
Hospital to make way for a new Parlia-
ment House building provokes predic-
tions about Macquarie Street’s eventual
decline as a street of doctors.
It’s not a new thought. The Govern-
ment encouraged it when, it was
reported 18 month ago, it was going to
let the hospital “run itself down”
hardly a happy prospect for consultant
physicians in Macquarie Street.
Certainly the past 15 years have
done a good deal to diminish the
mystique of “the Macquarie Street
man.” People haven’t felt quite the
same about him since they found out
the doctor with rooms in their local
medical centre had just as many letters
after his name.
There has always been a certain feel-
ing about a Macquarie Street pilgrim-
age, of course. Those dim lights,
ancient, shuddering lifts, dark wood
panelling, and antique copies of the
“National Geographic” had the appro-
priate air of doom and disaster one
associates with things medical.
But even that’s changing with the
new multi-storey buildings which have
gradually transformed Macquarie
Street’s once Georgian facade into 20th-
century concrete and glass. A visit to
a specialist in the brightness of Mena
House, where one shares an express
lift with petitioners to the Supreme
Court in Equity, is not quite the same.
Law and commerce have made signi-
ficant inroads into Governor Mac-
quarie’s original conception of the street
as a centre for the institutions of
medicine and government. And State
Government indecision about the ulti-
mate fate of Sydney Hospital has
probably influenced some specialists to
transfer their practices to suburban
centres, but the medical profession’s
drift away from Macquarie Street in
recent years is mainly because of
medicine’s own advances.
Macquarie Street grew up around
Sydney Hospital on the Harley Street
pattern. The hospital, established in
1816, was the only one of any impor-
tance in the colony, and naturally
doctors gravitated toward it. They
lived and practised in the street’s
graceful line of Georgian terraces,
became consultants to the hospital, and
were interested in student training. The
Royal Colleges were established, and,
later, medical blocks like the British
Medical Association building, with its
library and its professional section.
But World War II brought changes
to this miniature medical village. In the
post-war demand for multi-storey build-
ings, the old houses vanished, Mac-
quarie Street turned into a highway,
and the profession itself sought more
specialised knowledge.
Australian physicians travelled and
came back impressed with U.S. teach-
ing hospitals and the co-operation
between the hospitals and the univer-
sities.
And they initiated similar programs
here. In Sydney, teaching hospitals
spread, centres grew around them and
around district and country hospitals.
Sydney is ringed with suburban medical
complexes of this kind.
Yet the brass plates still proliferate
in Macquarie Street. There are vacan-
cies for consultants at the Eye Hos-
pital, at present attached to Sydney
Hospital. But the main part of the
hospital, despite its uncertain future,
has its full complement about 200
consultants, most of whom have rooms
in Macquarie Street.
Many Macquarie Street specialists,
however, have consultant appointments
at more than one hospital, so it has
become their practice to maintain
rooms both in Macquarie Street and in
the suburbs, spending certain days of
the week at each place.
With the increase of new office blocks
and higher rents, this is an expensive
business, and if Sydney Hospital is
demolished the only advantage doctors
will be collecting for the price of a
Macquarie Street address will be tradi-
tion. It will be only the spirit of
tradition, too, since its face is disap-
pearing fast.
The east side of Macquarie Street,
where the hospital is, is given over to
the Botanic Gardens and to public
buildings. According to the plan
devised by Canberra’s planner, Sir
John Overall, a new Parliament
House, facing the Domain, will be
built where the hospital now is with
the two wings of the Rum Hospital
flanking it.
From Circular Quay, on the west
side, a multi-million-dollar line of
office blocks marches up Macquarie
Street in tribute to the commercial
giants Unilever, ICI, British Tobacco,
and Lend Lease, while the Queen
Square end of the street is to see the
construction of a $l5 million building
which will house Commonwealth-
State courts. Doctors occupy the Wil-
liam Bland Centre, built in 1960, and

seemingly immovable monument to

across Bent Street.
One of the,sad inevitabilities about
Macquarie Street is that the smallest,
oldest, and finest buildings have had
to go, while others are apparently in-
destructible in their pitted stone ugliness
the Police Department building, for-
merly the Premier’s Department, its
trios of bronze lions now acid-green
with age and exposure, and the neigh-
boring Chief Secretary’s Department,
with its statuary, symbolising justice,
coated in mould.
Farther south, St. Stephen’s, which is
hardly architectural compensation for
the porticoed Georgian mansion, Bur-
dekin House, that used to stand on its
site, exhibits a poster of fluorescent
colors inviting attendance at a lunch-
hour recital. And one of the last
Georgian terraces in the street is empty
with a broken window, a sure sign of
its impending demolition. A few others
remain—the one in which the Royal
College of Physicians is housed, Wick-
ham House, which has some doctors’
rooms, and two two-storey ones, one
the Clune Galleries the other a bank.
Three were torn down to make way for
Citra House.
Other small and elderly buildings
look as if they’ve been waiting for the
wrecker for some time now, with blank
windows, marks left by the removal of
medical plates, and signs to say
“Dr. . . . has moved to another
address.”
But the most substantial bastions of
medical tradition remain, with their dis-
tinctive names—Wyoming, Craignish,
Beanbah Chambers, Harley, Hengrove
Hall, and, of course, BMA House, all
built to house doctors’ rooms.
The brass plates at the entrances are
kept constantly gleaming in contrast to
the obligatory murkiness of the
interiors, and Hengrove Hall has a
medieval-looking candelabra in. the
foyer to set against its wood panelling.
These look too imposing to fall by
the wrecker’s hammer for a long time
to come. But if Sydney Hospital leaves
Macquarie Street their particular
character may have to go, too.

Brunei: in a world of its own
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
ARRIVING in this tiny oil-supported,
British-protected State, one is forced
immediately to make the first of
several adjustments Brunei demands.
Here I am not talking about the
adjustments required to cope with
coronation ceremonies which began on
August 1 when the Crown Prince,
Hassanah Bolkiah, took over from his
father, Sir Omar Ali Saifuddin.
Preparations for the coronation were
veiled in secrecy, but, once begun, they
now continue in lively and colorful
fashion for a full month.
For a start, Brunei is a substantive sul-
tanate (or, better, sultancy) the only
one remaining in this area. Excepting
Penang, Malacca, and Sarawak (who
have appointed governors), all the
Malaysian States have their own sultans
and royal families. They are all now
constitutional monarchs with largely
titular functions and severely circum-
scribed powers. Sabah might be said
to be an exception in so far as while
it is also ruled by an appointed
Governor, more and more power
has accrued to Tun Mustapha, the
Chief Minister, himself a relative
of the old Sultancy of Sulu, and hav-
ing numerous relatives throughout the
southern Philippines. Some observers
still do not rule out that Mustapha
might become Sultan of Sabah one
day, but, of course, the Sultancy of Sulu
remains a myth wrapped in in-
credibly convoluted legalities sur-
rounded by an international squabble.
The Sultancy of Brunei, on the
other hand, is a very definite fact. The
words of greeting and praise, adora-
tion and admiration, in use at coro-
nation time, grate strangely on the
ears, even if those ears are used to the
fol-de-rol which is used concerning
Australia’s Queen. More important, the
words reflect substance. The Sultan
still rules. If the electric power lines
which criss-cross the State are all trace-
able back to the Shell oilfield, then,
similarly, many of the political and
social lines of power are plugged in to
the Sultan’s Palace.
Again, adjustment to the reality of
relatively uncircumscribed monarchy is
not the only one to be made. The
power lines flow to the Sultan, but
the British High Commissioner is very
definitely plugged into the Palace -
or should be, in normal circum-
stances. Brunei reminds one of the past,
because apart from the anomaly of
Hong Kong and the Pacific Islands
it is the only remnant of the British
Empire in our neighborhood. Mind
you, lest Bruneian susceptibilities be
offended, it is not a colony, and
not a protectorate, but a British pro-
tected State. For the outside world
upon whom the niceties of legal empire-
building were always lost, and have
long ceased to appear relevant, this
means a colony. For the Brunei Malays
this means that they are in 1959 treaty
relationship between “Her Majesty
the Queen” and “His Highness Sir
Omar Ali Saifuddin Sa’adul Khairi
Waddin, Soverign and Head of the
Most Esteemed Family Order, the Most
Honorable Order of the Crown of
Brunei, Knight Commander of the
Most Distinguished Order of Saint
Michael and Saint George, ibni Al-
marhum Sultan Mohamed Jamalul
Alam, Sultan of the State of Brunei,
for Himself and His Successors.”
The last treaty, in 1959, replaced
the previous ones of 1905 and 1906.
By the 1959 agreement, “Her Majesty
shall have complete control of the ex-
ternal affairs of the State” and “Her
Majesty shall have complete control
of the defence of the State and agrees
at all times to protect the State and
the Government, and ... to the utmost
of her power to take whatever measures
may be necessary for the defence of the
State.” Specifically, the defence is also
construed as meaning “against any
grave internal menace to the peace or
tranquillity of the State.”
In the 1959 agreement, Sir Omar
likewise agreed “to receive and pro-
vide a suitable residence for a High
Commissioner to advise on all matters
connected with the government of the
State other than matters relating to
the Moslem religion and the custom
of the Malays as practised in the
State” and further agreed “to accept
the advice of the High Commissioner.”
Lastly (since economics have allegedly
been the determining factor in East
of Suez commitments), “the cost of
the High Commissioner and his estab-
lishment as from time to time agreed
. . . shall be a charge on the revenues
of the State” —■. the British High Com-
mission cost Brunei nearly $400,000
(about SA. 120,000) in 1966.
In short, while Brunei subjects carry
British passports, they are not subject
to the inquiries of the U.N. Commis-
sion on Colonies. As we shall see, the
subject is very much Anglo-Brunei re-
lations. When Radio Brunei closes
down at night maybe it was my
imagination the playing of “God
Save the Queen” seemed muted after
that of the Brunei anthem.
These are not the only factors calling
for “adjustment.” Even they must be
seen against the background of the
past.
Brunei forcibly drew attention to
itself in December, 1962. Suddenly, the
outside world heard the oil State had
been sundered by revolt. Azahari’s
Partai Rakyat began an armed rebellion
against the status quo. In the process,
the rebels assisted materially the chain
of konfrontazi cause and effect, even
though they were unable to complete
what they began. Gurkha troops quickly
landed at the one small strip the rebels
had forgotten to litter with oil drums.
According to legend they exited from
their still-moving planes. The Royal
Marines came ashore, encountering sig-
nificant opposition only in the tiny
strip of Brunei the Temburong dis-
trict which is separated from Brunei
by Sarawak’s Fifth Administrative
Division. Azahari led the revolt from
Manila. It was badly organised, unable
to fight back, and was squashed.
But it happened. Surely the fact that
it did heralded the entry to the
nationalist, anti-colonial, independence-
no-matter-what 20th century? So one
would think, but the third and greatest
adjustment one has to make in Brunei
today is to recognise that entry has
not been made. Not yet, at least, and
it is not in the offing. The status

quo has been restored and strength-
ened. The “nationalist” forces have yet
to make a significant comeback. The
relegation of the Sultancy to being
a constitutional monarch, the elevation
to full parliamentary government, these
appear much further away than they
did at the time of the revolt. While
few, if any, will go as far as to say
it can never happen again, on the
surface, at least, it is the 1962 revolt
which now looks like a bad dream
from which the oil State has awoken.
Until the revolt the status quo had
been gradually, if unwillingly, changing.
The British, hoping to push Brunei
within Malaysia (which London, even
then, saw as part of its East-of-Suez
swansong), had “advised” the reforms
which preceded independence every-
where else. British expatriate officers
had virtually all been replaced by Mal-
ayan civil servants, who, as it turned
out, aroused more ire than their white
predecessors. The Partai Rakyat had a
100 percent victory at the elections and
could look forward to taking over power
under the due process of decolon-
isation. The British wanted out; nobody
apart from Azahari’s men wanted in.
While to this day no one is quite
certain as to the precise combination
of factors which caused the revolt, there
can be little doubt that by December,
1963, Brunei was a power vacuum up
for grabs; but Azahari’s men couldn’t
wait to grab it legally. The arrival of
British troops (until the revolt there
were none in Sabah, Sarawak, or
Brunei) set Brunei off on a new path.
Brunei had become a vacuum because
in the years immediately preceding the
revolt the Sultan had seemingly
detached himself both from the people
and affairs of the State, the administra-
tion had gradually ground to a halt,
little if any development was being
achieved the 1962- 1966 Plan didn’t
get under way until after the revolt.
In the years immediately after the
revolt, the Sultan moved to fill the
vacuum in his own way. In retrospect,
his ambiguous role in relation to the
revolt, in the light of subsequent devel-
opments, appears like a judicious waiting
upon events a talent rare among
South-East Asian leaders partly because
events rarely seem worth waiting upon.
Backed by the psychological security
r provided by the Gurkhas, the administra-
tion was restored largely by the whole-
sale importation of expatriate civil ser-
vants; the Royal Brunei Malay Regi-
ment was built up carefully but lavishly;
the old titles and pensions were used
to revive what is best described as
Brunei’s aristocracy; development got
under way, largely in public works and
the creation of infrastructure; more
scholarships were made available for
young Bruneians to go overseas to study;
confrontation was something of an
economic bonus; and the State, by
refusing to join Malaysia, kept its oil
revenues for itself. In a nutshell, while
Brunei is no oil sheikdom like Kuwait,
it is nonetheless (with old-age, disability
pensions, free health, etc.) a welfare
state of noteworthy dimensions.
All of which, while desirable, has
scarcely been according to the conven-
tional script. In Brunei, the traditional
ruler has enhanced his position and
power. The Brunei Malays are no nearer
democratic self-government but, in fact,
are much further away, bearing in mind
the (effective) suppression of the
Partai Rakyat and the importation of
500 to 600 expatriates. Five and a half
years after they first grabbed at power,
the “nationalist” forces have yet to
again demonstrate convincing strength.
Obviously, then, Brunei is something
of an odd man out (and not just
because it’s outside Malaysia) in the
British accelerated withdrawal plans. A
strong nationalist grouping, after all,
might conveniently ask for Brunei’s pro-
tection to end, but the Sultan par-
ticularly the old Sultan will definitely
not do so, and thereby hangs quite a
tale.
Why, after all, did the old Sultan, Sir
Omar Ali Saifuddin, abdicate in the
first place, thus opening the way for the
coronation? Once again the mystery. To
this day nobody is quite certain.
Informed guesswork there is, but nobody
knows for sure. In fact, when the old
Sultan actually abdicated last October,
no one outside the very immediate royal
circle heard about the abdication until
two hours after it had been signed,
sealed, and delivered. Not even the
State’s Mentri Besar (Chief Minister).
The old Sultan’s fondness for travel,
his future health, the Brunei Sultanate
historical lack of long-living sultans
and plethora of disputed successions, the
very distinct possibility that in his own
way and very strictly within the Brunei
context the old Sultan is “doing a
Sihanouk” (dispensing with the frills
and furbelows of title and ceremony for
the substance of politics) these are
among the reasons given.
But since the young Sultan now being
crowned had not completed the educa-
tive process in Britain that his father
had mapped out for him, none of these
explanations are satisfactory in relation
to the timing of the abdication.
The Sultan abdicated a couple of
days before the old British High Com-
missioner was due to be transferred
to the British High Commission in
Canberra. A little earlier in London
the then Commonwealth Secretary
Bowden had merely indicated, in pass-
ing conversation with Sir Omar, that
such a transference would be made.
Almost certainly the old Sultan felt this
was not the way to advise him on a
matter of considerable importance to
Brunei and felt slighted as a result. He
refused to accept the transfer; after the
old High Commissioner’s departure for
Canberra (itself unannounced in
Brunei), the temporary British Acting
Commissioner was likewise refused any
recognition. Maybe coincidentally, but
almost certainly not, the very period
when Her Britannic Majesty’s represen-
tative in Brunei was out of communica-
tion with the Sultanate coincided with

rumors that Brunei’s 100-odd million
sterling assets might be suddenly trans-
ferred. Needless to say, it also coin-
cided with a period when the future
of the Gurkha Battalion in Brunei was
likewise in doubt—it was due for with-
drawal and non-replacement in the
autumn of 1968.
With typical Malay courtesy, the
unrecognised Acting Commissioner was
evidently informed that his ostracism
was not a personal matter. Common-
wealth Secretary Thomson in January
was received, and evidently fitted into
Brunei’s picture of what is British much
better than Mr. Bowden. But still the
hiatus continued, with the Acting High
Commissioner unable to obtain Brunei’s
acceptance of the new High Commis-
sioner mainly because Brunei regarded
the old High Commissioner as having
never left!
No less a person than the ex-Com-
missioner-General for South-East Asia,
Malcolm MacDonald, was needed and
came all the way from East Africa to
bring the hiatus to an end. But the old
Sultan got what he wanted. For reasons
of face, the old High Commissioner was
returned from Canberra and was then
officially farewelled. For reasons of
politics, the Gurkha Battalion will be
replaced for a further two-year period.
Brunei continues to pay an undisclosed
but very substantial proportion of the
expenses of the British presence. The
new High Commissioner has been wel-
comed and will continue to give
“advice.” But he will be advising the
new Sultan, not necessarily the old
one. The old Sultan, for the next few
years at least, will be advising the new
one. In short, Sir Omar may have
given up his throne, but he has
retained, even increased, his power and
influence, retained a potential measure
of independence from Britain, and
gained time for the status quo in
Brunei.
Just how long that status quo can
continue to buttress Brunei’s stability is
also something of a mystery. Obviously
one cannot judge a State, busy in the
middle of the twentieth century reviv-
ing a nobility, by conventional stan-
dards. But, as the abdication story
shows, the old Sultan, let alone the
new one, beneath his traditional
exterior, is not afraid of the unconven-
tional. Maybe the British, by pushing
for parliamentary democracy, may be
giving conservative advice? Maybe the
Sultan, resisting such pressures, is—in
the Brunei context —a sensible radical?
Since the 1962 revolt, Brunei has stood
conventional Afro-Asian history on its
head. Maybe it will continue to do so?
One is left, however, noting the large
numbers of youth now coming through
the educational system, those who are
still underprivileged in terms of the
present power structure, the future
likely lack of job availability for the
Brunei Malays, the future power of the
Royal Malay Brunei Regiment uncheck-
mated by the Gurkhas, and therefore
wondering whether it will be profitable
for the new Sultan to wait upon events
in the same way as his father.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Wool subsidy: like financing
a fleet of F-111s every year
SURVEYING THE COMPLEX of
protective devices given our farmers,
an agricultural economist said, some
years ago, that Australian farmers had
been uniquely successful. They had suc-
ceeded in “establishing as an unques-
tioned principle the view that the Gov-
ernment’s role is merely to use its
powers of legal compulsion to effectuate
a producer-controlled monopoly and
thereafter either abdicate completely
irom all matters affecting the deter-
mination of the home price and the
control of marketing or else confine its
activities to the beneficial task of cal-
culating the increase in costs of pro-
duction resulting from the previous
year’s increase in home price.”
Quite a mouthful, but also an im-
pressive one-sentence summary of the
essence of agricultural marketing policy.
Last week (see Australia section) the
wool industry made yet another move
toward joining the league of the
propped and protected.
They resolved to adopt a price-
averaging scheme, which would be run
at a loss and subsidised. And though
still quarrelling over the detail, they
favored a system of “supply manage-
ment” which would involve the “pass-
ing-in of lots which do not achieve
a satisfactory price” and “changing
rostered quantities as may be considered
desirable.”
There was lots of talk about not
acquiring a stockpile in the process, for
fear of emulating the New Zealand
disaster. But it is most unclear how you
can pass-in wool or reduce the amount
being rostered for sale without acquir-
ing a stockpile. And what woolgrower
will find he is getting a “satisfactory
price”?
Much better for him to urge his
marketing authority to pass-in his wool.
And then, of course, next day that wool
is unlikely to be sold because the
political pressure will be on the Auth-
ority to hold stocked wool off the
market for fear of depressing the mar-
ket further, and preventing it gaining
a “satisfactory level.”
The agricultural economist’s summa-
tion of agricultural policy is inaccurate
or obsolete in one respect. The political
trend is toward increased questioning
of subsidy and protection schemes. The
wheat scheme, whereby the home-
consumption price is set and export-
price guarantees are given without
regard to sales prices, came under very
severe attack by the Government this
year. The principle of setting guaran-
teed prices according to some nominal
“cost-of-production” is only being main-
tained because the wheatgrowers
agreed to a substantial drop in the
figures for cost-of-production, saving the
Treasury many millions of dollars.
Dairying, tobacco, dried fruits, sugar,
and cotton all have their subsidy
schemes. Apart from beef, the wool
industry is the last to move in this
direction.
It is most unlikely to succeed. The
Government burnt its fingers in 1965
with an abortive referendum on the
question of a reserve-price authority,
and it is not keen to repeat the experi-
ence. Any subsidy on wool would also
be vastly more expensive than for other
industries.
The cost cannot be shifted quietly on
to local consumers (as it is with wheat,
sugar, and dairying) simply because
there are very few of them. More than
95 percent of wool is exported. Any
subsidy has to come out of consolidated
revenue. And it could grow to frighten-
ing proportions, because of the sheer
size of the wool industry. A 40 percent
subsidy on butter only costs $24 million,
but a subsidy of similar proportion on
wool would cost $320 million.
It would be like financing a fleet of
F-llls every year.
PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS
CERTAIN EXCESSES
JUST HOW MUCH of the massive
$lO4 million spent by the Common-
wealth last year under the Pharma-
ceutical Benefits Scheme was justifiable?
The Senate Select Committee of In-
quiry into hospital and medical costs
unearthed in Canberra last week some
reasons to suggest that a goodly pro-
portion of it was not.
According to the first breakdown ever
made of the pharmaceutical market
here, half of the total bill went to the
manufacturers and half to meet the
wholesalers’ costs, distribution charges,
and retail profits through extra-
ordinarily excessive mark-ups, retail
chemists managed to scoop up some
$4O million of that.
Of the 141 manufacturing outlets, 53
were Australian, but they received only
7 percent of the total expenditure. By
far the largest chunk went to U.S.
manufacturers (53 percent), Britain and
Switzerland received 10 percent each,
and Germany 7 percent. Inevitably, the
modern pharmaceutical industry must
be run on a world scale, with only the
very largest companies able to bear
the huge costs of the research involved
in flooding the market with something
Testing new drugs on mice
development costs are huge
like 100 new drugs every year; roughly
speaking, about the same amount is
spent on promoting these drugs, and
prices have escalated accordingly.
But something more than sharply
rising medical bills has resulted.
According to some pronouncements at
the British Medical Association in Lon-
don last year, the manufacturers’ sales-
men, their mailed circulars, and their
advertising campaigns aimed at finding
markets for their endless flow of new
drugs have resulted in confusion, des-
peration, and antagonism in many
quarters of the medical profession. Mas-
sive over-prescription (perhaps 20 times
so) has followed and the consequent
death of some 1000 people in Britain
alone each year.
The figures may be very tentative,,
but the general picture of huge over-
selling and a medical profession over-
whelmed with a pharmaceutical infor-
mation explosion (aggravated by the
latest techniques of the advertising
world) is valid enough.
Presumably, it is the function of the
nine members of the medical profession
which form Australia’s Pharmaceutical
Benefits Advisory Committee to throw
some guiding lights into the deepening
chaos. It is their job to decide which
drugs should be sold to patients at a
standard cost of 50 cents with the re-
mainder of the cost being borne by
the Commonwealth. Yet this anony-
mous body never makes the reasons
for its decisions known, though its con-
sidered opinions would presumably be
of some aid to the medical profession
in its confusion and so help to prevent
over-prescription.
On top of this must be added the
Commonwealth’s apparent indifference
to the retail chemists’ ad hoc profiteer-
ing. Profits of 100 percent are exces-
sive enough; recently noted mark-ups
of 1000 percent and more are absurd.
Deputy Director-General of the


Department of Health Dr. L. J. Wein-
holt told the Senate Select Committee
that continuing advances in medical
sciences would push up the cost of
medical insurance in Australia, yet he
was certain that the present health
scheme could and would adjust to the
changing world of medical science. But
it would seem that the present cost
need not be nearly as high as it is
if some adjustment were made to the
changing world of pharmaceutical
commercialism.
WAGE FIXATION
NOBODY GETS NOWHERE
EVEN IF IT WAS a bit provocative
of its publishers (Ruskin) to time the
appearance of V. C. Routley’s “Theory
of Wage Fixation” for the eve of the
big wages case, it should have given
the Arbitration Commission something
to think about during coffee break.
The central theme of the book
being that wage fixation here is not
getting anybody anywhere could be
somewhat disarming, not to say frus-
trating, to their new endeavors, the
more so perhaps because the book is
dedicated to Sir Henry Bland, lately
Secretary of the Department of Labor
and National Service, who according to
the Arbitration Commission was a
driving force behind it. Moreover,
although not saying tacitly that he sup-
ports the argument in the book, Pro-
fessor J. E. Isaac, another very big
industrial-relations gun, not averse
to firing shots at the Commission, has
written a very encouraging foreword to
it.
The main reaso.n Routley finds wage
fixation so ineffective in achieving its
aims (which he discusses in some
detail) are that non-wage and salary
groups in the community are so adept
at taking evasive action an outwork-
ing of the national art of “compensat-
ing for change” as it were. The truth,
as the author sees it, is that although
wage fixations seek to vary the pattern
of income distribution in favor of wage
and salary earners, it is unlikely to
succeed except in the very short run.
And it will fail simply because it
cannot directly compel other groups
to accept the new pattern of preventing
them from taking steps to compensate
for any absolute or relative deteriora-
tion in their own economic status fol-
lowing on the initial increase in money
wage rates.
What then is the value of wage fixa-
tions to the community? Here the
writer moves from pessimism to scepti-
cism. After listing ten possible reasons
why the community might support
wage fixation, he concludes: “The
chief value of wage fixation has been
psychological . . . the community does
in fact feel that it has been of value—
(regardless of whether such a belief is
justified) ... so that, ironically, the
greatest achievement of wage fixation
may perhaps have been to foster, unin-
MEN AND MATTERS
THE APPOINTMENT of David
Block to the board of furnituremaker
Sebels (Australia) Ltd. marks a mile-
stone in the business career of this
32-year-old South African who arrived
in Australia jobless just four years ago
with a law degree not recognised in
this country.
But if Sebels is his first listed public
company board, it will not be his last.
He is the sort of young businessman
whose talents are being increasingly
sought by alert Australian company
managements.
In South Africa the basis of com-
mon law is Roman-Dutch law, but
Australian common law is based on
the English. Fortunately, however,
things are not so different in the field
of commercial law, because Australia
and South Africa’s British colonial
heritage means that commercial law
affecting business (company, tax, and
contract) in both countries derives
from English commercial law.
Block walked the streets pretty hard
the first month he arrived here, Sep-
tember, 1964, but when three job
offers came up simultaneously he chose
to work with Darling and Co., the
investment banker. He joined them as
a very junior security analyst, and pro-
gressed through the ranks of the com-
pany to become manager of the finance
advisory department in 1967 and a
directors on its holding company board
1968.
Darlings business has grown from
modest beginnings in the ’fifties to its
present role as an important part of
the Australian financial scene, employ-
ing about 60 people, and with six
directors on its holding company board
Block sees investment banking as one
of the great growth industries, with
tremendous sophistication emerging in
the financing of Australian business.
The finance and advisory services
supplied by the investment banker in-
cludes all forms of short, medium, and
long-term financing, arrangement of
company acquisitions and mergers, and
careful advising of the appropriate
financial structures of companies, with
assistance on the best means of
budgeting a company’s financial
requirements.
OUT HERE ONLY a short while ago
having talks and swopping ideas with
his opposite number in QANTAS,
BOAC’s chief of productivity services,
Dr. Jos Faraday, came back again last
week to give lectures in Perth and
Sydney on the science of productivity;
the pursuit of efficient management in
which he has been something of a
pioneer.
The rising interest in management
studies across the whole spectrum of
business and commerce points to the
fact that the airline companies" are not
alone in recognising the difficult years
of rising costs and falling yields in a
climate of fierce competition that lie
ahead, though for the airlines such dark
days are more imminent than for most.
The European operators tend to want
to offset depression by raising fares; the
U.S. by lowering them; and Dr.
Faraday by increasing management
efficiency.
Part scientist, part philosopher, part
psychologist, Dr. Faraday’s approach is
novel and essentially very simple—
indeed, it is so simple it surprises him
that managements haven’t been thinking
along similar lines for the past fifty
years and more.
Basically, any activity requires for
its output three things: manpower,
materials, and capital equipment. And
David Block
Dr. Jos Faraday
the best arbiter of efficiency is pro-
ducing a prescribed output with the
minimum input of these three resources.
Dr. Faraday’s job is to measure the
output and input and advise on tech-
niques of getting more out of a job
while putting less in whether it is
money, staff, or simply effort.
Output per unit input gives the
total productivity measure. And with
this Dr. Faraday keeps a check on
the efficiency of BOAC’s management.
It is a better indicator than profit, he
says: a firm can make a profit while
efficiency is decreasing.
It is a delicate path of diplomacy
that he has to tread through the multi-
plicity of departments which make up-
BOAC. Above all, he wants to avoid
any impression that he is running some
sort of private Gestapo. The essential
qualifications of the 142 members of his
department are curiosity and an ability
to get on with people. They only gcv
where they are invited, though Dr.
Faraday does admit to engineering an
invitation sometimes.
So far, 75 percent of all BOAG
activity has been explored from the
input-output basis. And, from the
reports, recommendations, and psycho-
logical shake-ups that followed, plenty
of increased efficiency has been
achieved.


tentionally and unconsciously, a belief
in its own usefulness to the community.”
Though the exposition of his full
argument on bargaining in wage nego-
tiations is not concluded in this parti-
cular volume which is part one of a
trilogy which will be rounded off in
part three on wages policy to appear
later for the time being he suggests
that wage bargaining would have to be
supported by a variety of measures,
including the revision of the income-
tax structure to reward competition,
and penalise collusion among all buyers
and all sellers of all goods and services.
Another would be to raise unemploy-
ment benefits to that proportion of the
minimum wage at which disincentive
to re-enter the workforce begins to
appear. Reinforcing these would need
to be complete transferability between
jobs of all employee fringe benefits,
and, by implication, a much higher
level of full employment than at
present.
Speculator’s Diary
SOME REAL ATTRACTION
AMONG THE
TOP-QUALITY SHARES
THERE COMES a time when even a
speculator buys good-quality shares
rather than the chancy ones that gener-
ally provide the greatest prospect of a
quick quid. There are several top-
quality stocks in my current portfolio;
most of the best rises have come from
them. And some of the top-quality
stocks in the speculative area have now
come back to very attractive levels
following the market’s unenthusiastic
past few weeks. Look at BHP. A month
or so ago the shares were nudging $25
and now they are back down below the
$23 level. And nothing has happened
to the company in the meantime to
make the shares any less appealing. It
is simply that the market has lost
interest. Meanwhile, BHP continues to
discover more oil and gas; last week
there were further small shows in the
Snapper well around 9300 feet follow-
ing an earlier oil show at 4450 feet
and a gas show at 4000 feet two months
ago. It will take some time before the
significance of these shows is known.
However, the reality about buying
BHP shares is that an investor is doing
a lot more than that when he pays his
$22.80 for the stock. He is, in fact,
buying the market; he is staking his
faith in the resumption of buoyant
market conditions. For no matter how
good BHP may look, its price is only
as good as the market’s psychology
will make it. And without buyers, par-
ticularly from overseas, it wouldn’t
matter how many new oilfields BHP
discovered.
Well, this speculator thinks that
BHP will not fall much farther and
could rise a lot higher within a couple
of months once the market’s usual mid-
year hiatus ends in a few weeks’ time.
One serious problem that speculators
do face, however, with a stock like
BHP is that brokerage is so high; the
shares have to rise $1 before a specu-
lator covers his brokerage cost. Never-
theless, the shares look too good to miss
at $22.80 and so I’ve added another 50
to those I already hold.
Another top-quality mining stock
suffering from the market’s present
psychology is Western Mining Corpora-
tion. More than $230 million has been
chopped off the market’s capitalisation
of the company’s operations in the past
few weeks as the shares have fallen
from $l6 to only $12.70. WMC is now
valued at $9OO million, which looks
pretty hefty until it is put alongside
other big names in nickel. Anyway, last
week’s unhappy market response to the
company’s latest quarterly report
(which revealed some magnificent
values in the Kambalda West area)
has brought the shares down to levels
where it is really worth a speculator’s
while to have a go. I bought 50.
But one item in WMC’s report has
done more good for Norseman Gold
Mines and Ravensthorpe Copper than
it has for WMC. The news that WMC
is stepping up the nickel search in two
prospects in the St. Ives area has
increased hopes that the Norseman-
Ravensthorpe leases adjoining WMC’s
in the area (and on which several
anomalies have been discovered and
are being tested) may also turn up
something good.
But which of the two partners in
the leases is the best buy? Ignoring
their other interests, the 60/40 owner-
ship of the exploration company means
that each Norseman share (following
the recent placement) is worth 2.43
Ravensthorpe shares. That means it is
70 cents cheaper to buy Ravensthorpe
at $2.90 (including the 10 cents call to
pay) rather than Norseman at $8 for
the nickel leases alone. So I bought 200
at $2.80.
Buying all this big stuff meant a big
clean-out for the portfolio to find the
funds. Some stocks that I’d have liked
to hold on to a bit longer had to go,
but most had been indifferent per-
formers. On Stegbar I made $47; on
Bonds I lost my brokerage; on Brooker
I made $33 plus acquiring 80 free
rights (and to round off my holding of
Brooker rights into a marketable parcel
I bought 20 during the week); on
Hardie Trading I made $65; on H. H.
Webb, which turned out to be a dead-
and-alive sort of stock for me, I lost
$10; on Prestige, the Dunlop bid made
me $159; on Dickson Primer I made
$22; and on Consolidated Milk Indus-
tries I dropped $2.
All this leaves kitty at $72.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
UK METRICATION
AUSTRALIA WAS AHEAD of Britain
in adopting decimal currency, but we
are definitely behind in adoption of the
metric system of weights and measures.
A parliamentary committee in Canberra
recommended adoption of metrics last
year, but nothing more has happened.
In Britain, however, metrication (to
coin a phrase) is well under way. Their
Minister for Technology, Mr. Benn,
told Parliament that Britain is-
aiming at general adoption of the
metric system of weights and measures
by the end of 1975.
Mr. Benn’s statement follows the pub-
lication of a report by a Ministry of
Technology standing joint committee on
metrication. He said the Government
accepted the committee’s recommenda-
tion that 1975 should be the target
date for completion of the switch to
metrics and that a Metrication Board
should be established to guide, stimu-
late, and co-ordinate the changeover.
The Board, to be set up as soon as
possible, would be purely advisory. Its
membership would reflect the interests
of all sectors of industry, distributive
trades, education, and particularly the-
general public and consumers.
“Every sector of the economy need"
not move at the same pace. But there
will be unnecessary confusion and ex-
pense and great difficulties for industry
unless there is central machinery for
co-ordinating the program of change
for the various sectors. Compulsory
powers would not be sought to enforce
the switch,” he said.
One of the first tasks of the new
Metrication Board will be to submit to
the Government an appreciation of how
the switch will affect each sector of the
community and a breakdown of costs
to each sector.
Several of Britain’s major industries
are already well on the way to metri-
cation. These include the engineering
and building industries.

How to get a Hertz rental car
anywhere in Australia
without leaving home
If you can get to a telephone,
you can get a Hertz car. One
call to your local Hertz office
is all that’s needed. If you’re
flying interstate and you need
a car, phone Hertz before
you leave. Hertz pre-booking
means the right car, at the
right place, at the right time
be it airport, station or
dock. Hertz guarantee it.
And the Ford or other fine car
you get from Hertz has been
run-in, but never run down. It’s
a Hertz policy to trade in cars
early in life. It’s also Hertz
policy to give every car a
thorough check-up before it
checks out. It’s called the
‘Hertz 19 point check-up’. We
check the big things like hand
brake, foot brake, clutch,
steering. And the little things
like the seat adjustment lever,
the heater, the radio. If they
don’t work, you don’t get the
car. So the car you do get,
works. And it’s also clean.
That’s another Hertz policy.
We wash and wax the outside,
vacuum and dust the inside.
And we never forget to clean
the windscreen.
And here’s another nice sur-
prise. Hertz rents cars at a
lower rate than any other
major car rental company in
Australia. And only Hertz has
Economile the special ‘long
distance’ rate that saves you
money. Your daily mileage
rate can be reduced up to
50%.
Give Hertz a call next time
you need a car. The number
is in your local directory. And
there’s a car ready for you
anywhere you name.
Hertz: The key to more than a car.

What about a world recession?
THERE IS STILL a serious risk of
world recession, and prospects for the
United States economy are “not
bright.” That is the gloomy message in
two articles in last week’s London
“Economist.”
For the fear is not only that both
Britain and the U.S. may fail to swing
their balance of payments out of the
red and sustain them there but also
that in trying to do so they may move
the world into a serious industrial slow-
down.
The grand international economic
strategy for 1968 went something like
this: devaluation in Britain, a touch of
the brakes in the U.S., and continued
expansion in Continental Europe to
pull the reserve-currency countries
smoothly toward balanced payments
while neatly trimming the bulging
external surplus of the EEC.
But things haven’t worked out like
that so far. Both Britain and the U.S.
delayed in restraining internal demand;
their deficits gaped wider and the
Common Market’s surplus continued
to expand.
With deflationary fiscal measures
now taken in both Britain and the U.S.,
there is general expectation of a remark-
ably sharp turnround. The Paris-based
experts of the Organisation for Econ-
omic Co-operation and Development
foresee that, given continued expansion
in the EEC, the current combined
deficit of Britain and the U.S., now
running at an equivalent annual rate
of some $U.5.1750 million, might show
an improvement of around $3500 mil-
lion before the end of the financial year,
achieving a surplus in the region of
SSOOO million by 1969.
In the process it is foreseen that (a)
the average rate of economic growth
among all OECD countries the 21
biggest industrial powers of the West
will drop from the 5| percent in-
crease recorded for real domestic pro-
ducts in the first half of 1968 to 3
percent in the second half; (b) between
these two half years, U.S. growth rate
of GNP will decline from 6 to 2| per-
cent, and the U.K.’s from 4 to 2£
percent; (c) the massive 15 percent rate
of increase in exports from OECD
countries recorded in the first half of
the year will decline to 5 percent in
the second half the countries to be
worst hit by the export decline will
be those that rely most heavily on the
U.S. market, like Canada and Japan;
Britain, too, will feel the pinch; and
in the increased competition for the
reduced export potential so will every-
body else!
Discussing export prospects for the
near future, the OECD points out that
in the recent past only Australia among
the developed primary producing
countries has provided a growing mar-
ket for OECD exports. The OECD
believes that it will continue to do so
with possible scope for significant in-
creases in the months ahead, but “the
balance-of-payments position (in Aus-
tralia) may induce restrictive action
later in the year.”
One way for Britain and the U.S. to
improve their balance - of - payments
deficit in the face of the new, stringent
export conditions would be opened up
if the EEC countries were to pep up
domestic demand further and allow
their external current surpluses to
dwindle. A couple of years ago, when
they were still struggling with overfull
demand, it might have seemed imperti-
nent to say this. But now it is clear
not only that domestic demand has yet
to recover fully, from the 1967 reces-
sion (many finance ministries still do
not realise how much of this year’s
economic upswing has been based on
exports) but also that productivity has
soared ahead in Europe over the last
business cycle (while it has slowed
down in the U.S.). The recipe for
reflation in cautionary Europe exists.
A second possible way out would
have the EEC offsetting its current sur-
plus with big capital outflows. The
OECD points to the recent increase in
net outflow of official capital and the
phenomenal growth of the Euro-bond
market, giving borrowers access to vir-
tually all Continental Western Euro-
pean countries. Yet unless official capi-
tal outflows from the EEC rise much
more steeply than seems on the cards at
present, this solution looks more appar-
ent than real: for a major proportion of
the funds tapped by the Euro-bonds
come ultimately from outside Europe
(even though channelled secretly
through Switzerland), and often from
rich individuals in those developing

countries that would most be hit by a
worsening of their trade account with
Europe and America.
Finally, in the new conditions, Britain
and the U.S. together may fail to swing
their balance of payments enough, or to
sustain such an improvement. This is
the third possible outcome, which the
OECD tactfully refrains from discuss-
ing. The worst outcome of all would
be if this happened while the effort to
avert such a failure nevertheless man-
aged to move the world into a serious
industrial slowdown. The result could
be a currency crisis, and a recession,
too.
Such pessimistic thoughts are most
acute in the U.S., where the strongest
dose of restraint administered for sev-
eral decades is being gulped down at a
time when many of the stimulative
forces which powered the recent boom
are waning anyway.
Prospects for the American economy
over the next 12 months are not bright.
The 10 percent tax surcharge and man-
datory cut in Government spending are
only two of the factors which will be
operating to depress business activity.
There is a danger that the Federal
Reserve will await very definite evi-
dence of a cooling of the economy
meaning a positive slowing in the lead-
ing business indicators and a rising
level of unemployment before it
takes any significant action such as a
decrease in the discount rate. If so,
it may hold the monetary rein too
tight for too long.
This, together with the turn to fiscal
restraint, may induce something more
than the OECD’s expected slowdown.
The popular forecast in Washington is
that the restraint imposed will bring
no more than a slowing in growth, per-
haps to a rate of around 2 percent
over the next year. This is a more
measly figure than the OECD antici-
pates. But it may actually be too opti-
mistic an appraisal. Taking into
account all the negative influences act-
ing on business, slow growth is prob-
ably the best that can be anticipated.
A more likely pattern is no growth.
And a small decline lasting long enough
to be classified as a recession is a
distinct possibility.
Defence spending is about to crest;
even if the Vietnam War continues,
outlays are unlikely to increase much.
The impact of defence orders is already
ebbing. Three other guesses being made
in the U.S. are that (a) the Federal
Reserve will begin to ease monetary
policy early this autumn; (b) there
will be only a slow increase in Federal
non-defence spending (but a continued
advance of SU.S.IO billion, annual rate,
in State and local outlays); and (c) the
tax surcharge will not come off at mid-
year 1969 as scheduled. Given this set
of assumptions, the U.S. economy will
undergo a slowdown in the third
quarter of this year, no real growth
in the fourth (with obvious recessionary
tendencies) and, perhaps, an actual
decline in the first quarter of 1969.
Consumer spending is likely to ad-
vance only slightly in the third quarter
of this year as the tax increase bites
home. There will probably be an actual
decline in sales of consumer durables,
with car sales coming down from their
current pace of over 9 million. This
may hit American manufacturers
harder than foreign ones. It is possible
that imported-car sales will show no
weakness; they may, indeed, be running
at an annual rate of over 1 million this
autumn, even while total personal
spending turns sluggish.
Stockbuilding seems bound to drop
sharply in the third quarter, but should
remain positive, owing to some involun-
tary accumulation. By the end of this
year, stocks may be declining. Most
depressingly, business spending on plant
and equipment, which levelled out in
the second quarter, seems unlikely to
rise between now and mid-1969. The
operating rate in manufacturing is now
less than 85 percent of capacity, a
point which does not encourage expan-
sion. By the year-end the rate will prob-
ably be in the neighborhood of 80 per-
cent, a level which would positively dis-
courage additions to the capital stock.
Corporate profits are going to decline.
Thus, the economy may lose simul-
taneously all the main forces that have
hitherto been generating buoyant
demand. Unemployment could grow
quite rapidly: from a low of 3J percent
in May to about 4 percent (perhaps
more) by the year-end, and to at least
4J percent early next year. The sharp
upward course of prices (by U.S. stan-
dards) of 4 percent annually will be
slowed by the end of the year; but,
even in the event of a recession, it is
not likely to hold below 3 percent for
the next year. The one area to benefit
from the slowdown and one which
will aid recovery in 1969 should be
housing. New homebuilding is currently
at a rate of 1.3 million a year, having
fallen from an average of 1.5 million
several months ago. Declining interest
rates, easier availability of funds, and a
tremendous pent-up demand for homes
may well push the rate up to 1.5 mil-
lion again by the year-end, and to 2
million at some point in 1969.
The great boom in imports into the
U.S. is drawing to a halt. Now that
there is not to be a steel strike, all the
foreign steel which has been imported
in preparation for it will be available
as stocks for U.S. industry to live off.
Between now and mid-1969 there may
be a small rise in total American
imports of all commodities, but per-
haps only to an annual rate of imports
of goods and services of around
$U.5.49,000 million by then, against an
estimated $U.5.47,500 million in the
first quarter of 1968.
America’s balance on trade payments
should show a fairly sharp improvement
along the lines foreseen by the OECD.
But there is little reason to be hopeful
about longer-run prospects. Later next
year, on the heels of economic recovery,
the problem will probably emerge once
again with growing force. However, for
the balance of this year into early 1969,
the odds are that foreign confidence
in the dollar will increase.

The economy .* Defence expenditure rose by $159
million to $lllO million in 1967-68, of a total
Commonwealth expenditure of $6558 million.
Australian lead producers increased their price to
local consumers by $2O to $230 a ton.
The morketS .* The week was a test of nerves for
speculators on Australian share markets. As prices retreated,
the sellers largely withdrew and turnovers were low
by recent standards. Although Great Boulder’s weekend
nickel report was a good start, WMC’s, midweek, failed to
fortify the nickels section.
Great Boulder gained a net $2.40 to $15.60 and its
partner, North Kalgurli, added 60c to $l2, while WMC
dropped 40c to $12.80. But near neighbor, Norseman
Gold, attracted supporters and the price rose $1.20 to $B.
CRA added 70c to $20.70, but Hamersley shed 90c
to $l4, and Peko dropped 30c to $12.70. In oils, the major
public partner in the Legendre well, Woodside, lost 12c
to $1.98, while Oil Search, whose Ini well is being drilled
by Esso, added a net 7c to $1.27.
With the Budget on the immediate horizon, the
industrial market was not exciting, either. BHP slipped
80c to $22.70, AC I firmed 12c to $3.34. R. W. Miller,
with TNT a new shareholder, added 17c to $1.63.
Slater Walker gained favor, presumably in London, with
a rise of 90c to $7.20.
The N.S.W. Government will bring down legislation
to ensure that N.S.W. stock option transactions are legally
binding.
Industrial stocks on the London Stock Exchange moved
to lower ground on subdued trading and weekend
selling. Blue chips to go fractionally down included
Courtaulds, Unilever, Rolls-Royce, ICI, and Bowater.
Prospects of an early Bank Rate cut meant many gains
for bonds.
A great dullness has seized Wall Street, although late on
Friday some of the glamor issues were given a modest
kick upwards. Overall, this late rally didn’t make much
difference to the list.
Companies: Mercantile Credits, in which the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation have a 40
percent interest, improved profit only marginally to
$1.55 million in the June year, whereas Mutual
Acceptance Co., in which the Chartered Bank of London
has a 40 percent interest, lifted profit 22 percent to $1.54
million ... In Adelaide, Lensworth Finance earned
5 percent higher.
Philip Morris netted a record $3 million, giving
earning rate of 66 percent after the one-for-two bonus.
In its second interim report for the 18 months’ period
to December, 1968, Union Carbide had its best
result for the June six months, but directors warned of
rising costs.
A Netherlands company, Amev, is offering to buy half
the capital of each shareholder in Victoria Insurance
Co. Ltd. for $5.50 a share . . . After a “first come-first-
served” bid by Fire and All Risks Insurance Co. Ltd.
for a 32.4 percent equity in Australian and International
Insurances was stalemated, FAI chairman, Mr. L. F. Adler,
made a $1.5 million personal bid for the company,
representing $2.50 cash a share.
Profit of steel and aluminium merchant William Atkins
slipped 10 percent to $247,000, but earnings and sales
have been buoyant since the breaking of the drought
in south-eastern Australia . . . Scrap metal dealer
Albert G. Sims’ result see-sawed; $lOO,OOO higher tax meant
$lOO,OOO smaller profit, but dividend went up anyhow
from to 15 percent.
Lino and vinyl tile maker Michael Nairn lost $88,435
in the June half, and was affected by severe local and
overseas competition . . . Simpson Pope’s result of
$774,000 was the best profit for five years, so payout
was nudged from 2 to 3 percent.
Publisher of the “Hobart Mercury,” Davies Brothers,
topped previous best profit in 1966 with a result of
$303,000 and dividend was augmented to 16 percent . . .
Ballarat and Western Victoria TV profit rose to a record"
$192,000, and payout was enlarged from 12£ to 17|- percent.
Pre-tax profit of Cellulose Australia Ltd. rose 40
percent, but for the first time in six years the company
provided current tax, so net result fell from $434,000
to $383,000 . . . Foundation garment maker Formfit
paid out higher dividend from substantially better profit . . .
Speedo made a rapid profit advance from $142,000 to
$220,000, but dividend was pinned at 12 \ percent.
Owner of the Southern Cross Hotel, Southern Cross
Properties, earned 8.3 percent on capital, the best
result to date . . . Moteliers’ result for 1967-68 was no
change on its predecessor, but the company reported a
much brighter start to the current year.
Western Mining continued to extend its known Kambalda
nickel deposits in 11 new drill holes and found new
prospects south of Lake Lefroy, according to the latest
quarterly report. It has located a new copper prospect
north of Kalgoorlie (on which the London market
had circulated rumors) and is drilling for nickel in the
Scotia area, where Great Boulder and North Kalgurli have
had impressive assays of up to 17.7 percent nickel over
a four-foot width, with an average of 3.54 percent over
a width of IOOf feet . . . Australia’s biggest producer of

THE LAND
The many factors
in the wheat
stabilisation scheme
Wheatland ... higher prices, higher cost of production
TIME HAS BEEN running out fast
for the Australian Wheatgrowers’
Federation in its negotiations with the
Government on a new stabilisation
scheme. But though recently there were
still some big blocks to the light at the
end of the tunnel, there was a good
chance of the parties breaking through
them in a matter of days so that State
Governments could get down to passing
the necessary complementary legislation
before the existing scheme expires.
There wasn’t all the difficulty about
agreeing what would be arranged for
the first year in the matter of price
guarantees. The really big differences
concerned the price, and quantity
determinations after that.
It was generally conceded that for
the coming year the guaranteed home
consumption price for wheat would be
settled at $1.70 a bushel and probably
also that the Government would con-
cede something to the wheatgrowers’
case for a more liberal offer than of
$1.45 a bushel guaranteed for 150 mil-
lion bushels of export wheat, with an
upping to $1.50 or perhaps $1.53 a
bushel. Alternatively there was a pros-
pect of putting up the export quantity
to 175,000 bushels (the WFA originally
asked for 200 million) leaving the
guarantee at $1.45 or some such com-
bination which would get the agreement
through without too much loss of face
on either side.
Whatever the permutations turn out
to be, the Government is unlikely to
have weakened in its determination
drastically to revise the cost of produc-
tion formula, or to abandon it altogether
for the calculation of price guarantees
under the new stablisation agreement.
If the cost of production method is to
be used in future as guiding the guaran-
teed export price, it is virtually certain
that at least some of the main escalating
elements in the old formula will be
dropped. The most likely of these
escalators to be removed is the interest
on capital employed.
Under previous wheat stabilisation
agreements only part of the wheat
crop has been subject to price guaran-
tees based on a cost-of-production
formula allowing fully for all fixed
charges, including all the “notional”
interest payments. The remainder has
been sold for what it could fetch on
the world market. However, loaded
with a heavy and strongly rising charge
for interest, the guaranteed portion has
been sufficiently large to make wheat-
farming increasingly attractive for the
employment of capital. The result of
this has been to push up wheatland
values and, notional or otherwise, the
industry’s interest charges have, in
consequence, also increased. Then fol-
lowing the agreed procedure under the
stabilisation scheme, these higher
interest charges have been written into
the cost of production of wheat as
assessed under the formula. The 1967-
68 interest charges were put in at as
much as 66.28 cents a bushel, com-
pared with only 117.44 for all “cash
outlays.” Year by year interest charges
have been rising fast, until last year
they represented nearly a quarter of
the calculated cost of wheat per bushel
at sidings.
The most recent reliable evidence on
wheatland value trends relates to the
five-year period, 1961 to 1966, as given
by official land valuation officers in
the various States. Though no official
average has been struck from this evi-
dence, it looks as though the increase
in land values in the wheat areas in
this period was at least 50 percent.
Given that cost of production is
acceptable as a guide to fixing guaran-
teed prices, the problem of how to
allow for rising land values, especially
when these derive from, or partly from,
the generousness of the prices guaran-
teed, is admittedly a tricky one. Just
as surely as hard cash, running expenses
charges of a fixed nature such as
depreciation and interest on capital
have to be allowed for in the calcula-
tion. They cannot be ignored on any-
thing but the very short term. To do so,
as the Government has done in its new
approach to wheat stabilisation, is not,
however, in defiance of sound econ-
omics, even if it can be argued that it
is on strictly theoretical grounds. The
Treasury’s defence would be, perhaps,
that there’s a strong national element
in the overall cost of interest as assessed
in the old cost of production formula,
in that only those farmers who’ve
bought their land at the latest high
valuations can, taking a strict practical
line, be reckoned as having to incur the
interest charges on the capital used to
purchase it. Those who’ve bought their
land at lower prices or, say, inherited
it, may argue in strict economics that
they could sell it and realise the present
high values for wheatland, and earn
the going rate of interest on the result-
ant funds by putting them to some other
employment. In that case, they would
be just as entitled to regard interest
as a legitimate cost as those who’ve
recently acquired land at the higher
values. This “alternate-use” argument is
all very well, but the hard fact is that
as applied in wheat stabilisation it has
stood economics on its head, and tax-
payers have had to pay the price for it.
AGRISEARCH
NITROGEN LOSS
THE VALUE OF nitrogenous fer-
tilisers was one of the tantalising mat-
ters discussed at the International Soils
Congress, Adelaide, during last week.
Of the very serious problems still con-
fronting agricultural science, few
appear to have caused more confusion
and engendered more scepticism than
that concerning the gaseous loss of
nitrogen from fertiliser applied to the
soil. But the time is coming when a
farmer will know whether this or that
kind of nitrogenous fertiliser releases
more or less of its nitrogen to the
atmosphere under his particular set of
circumstances. By simple arithmetic, he
will then be able to calculate the price
he is paying per unit of effective nitro-
gen. Sooner or later farmers will come
to realise that simply increasing the
rate of application is not in itself an
economic means of overcoming the
gaseous waste and other losses.
Dr. J. R. Simpson, of the CSIRO’s
Division of Plant Industry, has con-
tributed a mite of knowledge which
will help to bring the time of enlighten-
ment nearer to hand. He presented a
scientific paper to the Soils Congress
concerning the “losses of urea nitrogen
from the surface of pasture soils.” His
findings were derived from experiments
performed on a perennial ryegrass
pasture growing on “Ginninderra,” the
CSIRO Field Station near Canberra.
His conclusions, therefore, are relevant
to farmers on lighter soils in the better
rainfall districts of southern Australia.
At that station he found that 60 per-
cent of the nitrogen in urea was lost
to the atmosphere when he topdressed
in autumn at the rate of 601 b of nitro-
gen per acre. Application of this
quantity of fertiliser in late winter was
somewhat more efficient, resulting in a

loss of about 40 percent. Clearly, the
price quoted for urea nitrogen in the
bag was only about half its real cost on
this particular occasion.
In the same series of experiments
he compared the efficiency of several
different forms of solid nitrogenous
fertilisers. (He excluded anhydrous
ammonia and ammonia solutions, be-
cause their injection is already known
to be harmful to pastures.) Sodium
nitrate gave the best overall results.
However, because of its relatively low
nitrogen content and high price at
present, it is not a practical proposi-
tion for farmers. All things considered,
the old standby, ammonium sulphate,
performed well. Dr. Simpson has cal-
culated that generally, to be competi-
tive in terms of pasture production,
the price of nitrogen sold as urea
landed on the farm should not be more
than three-quarters of the price of
nitrogen in ammonium sulphate.
His experiments indicated that no
form of nitrogenous fertiliser applied
to pasture in autumn or early winter
is likely to produce economically im-
portant responses in pasture growth.
Given the right conditions, late winter
or early spring applications can be
profitable, however. But the farmer
faces the risk that high soil moisture
at this period will cause large losses
of nitrogen from the applied fertiliser,
either by leeching or volatilisation.
This risk is greatest with urea. Severe
losses were recorded when this fer-
tiliser was applied two days after half
an inch of rain had fallen. The sur-
face of the soil was moist enough to
stimulate the breakdown of the fer-
tiliser to ammonia, which escaped to
the atmosphere, but there was insuf-
ficient moisture to dissolve the urea
and carry its nitrogen down into the
root zone of the soil. Losses were
least when rain fell within five days
of topdressing.
Seasonal conditions and time of
application have a big influence on the
responses obtained from bag nitrogen
and usually make the difference between
a heavy loss and worthwhile profit. The
conditions conducive to profit need to
be clearly defined for the different dis-
tricts, fertilisers, and pastures. Thus,
Dr. Simpson pointed out that in ex-
ceptionally good autumns topdressing
with nitrogen could be advantageous
provided the pasture did not contain a
high proportion of clover. In dry
autumns, topdressing would be certainly
wasteful, but in average seasons the
application of a nitrate form of nitrogen
fertiliser such as ammonium nitrate or
calcium ammonium nitrate would be
valuable.
Fertiliser manufacturers have looked
ahead and seen that the constant pres-
sure imposed by the cost-price squeeze
will force our farmers to apply nitrogen
at ever-increasing rates to more acres
in an effort to raise farm output. The
fertiliser firms have, therefore, em-
barked upon a vast expansionist pro-
gram, but do not seem to have planned
an equal increase in research.

WMC's STRATEGY:
HOW MUCH
OR TOO MUCH NICKEL?

ing mined), Durkin (North, where
the next shaft is going down), and Jan
(across Lake Lefroy in the Torquata
area about one mile north-west of St.
Ives). Drilling since then has estab-
lished that these three shoots hold a
great deal more nickel; how much
more is not very important at this
stage, as the company can only mine
so much at a time.
At February 1, the main reserve was
in the Durkin shoot, which held 5.75
million tons of ore averaging 3.7 per-
cent nickel. Since then the April report
revealed that drilling had been carried
out to determine more accurately the
eastern flank of the ore structure. Holes
drilled to complete the most northerly
traverse intersected ore outside the
present ore-reserve calculations and in-
dicated that the ore position is con-
tinuing in depth to the north. In the
latest quarter’s drilling, the company
SLASHING the price of Western Min-
ing Corporation shares following last
week’s quite good quarterly report has
every likelihood of being proved wrong
in the long run. But there is a techni-
cal rationale behind the fall for day-
to-day speculators. And, fortunately, it
provides longer-term investors with
some excellent opportunities of buying
the stock at reasonable levels. For it
is an outstanding buy.
Speculators are right in recognising
that there may well be no further stimu-
lus to the company’s share price, at
least from official announcements, for
another 12 weeks unless something
really dramatic happens. The com-
pany’s preliminary report for the year
to June 30 is due in a month’s time,
but it has not, in the past, been any
more than a brief recital of profit.
The annual report, which is a very
detailed document, is not due until
late in October, and the annual meet-
ing is in November. Speculators may
not have the patience to wait (and
impatient speculators mean weak mar-
kets), especially now that it is evident
that the company is in no rush what-
soever to go into print about the in-
creasing size of its reserves.
Nor is there any reason why it should.
And, in any event, its basic strategy
is now clearly in another direction
and sensibly so. Until the current drill-
ing delineates the likely perimeters of
the orebodies being drilled, it seems a
fruitless exercise to keep increasing its
guesses of how much ore is there. This
is especially so when it is evident, from
a reading of the company’s interim
reports, that the subsequent massive
additions to the 9.3 million tons an-
nounced in February are being con-
tinually added to by more drilling.
How much more nickel the company
has in reserves is almost irrelevant; it
has so much more than its projected
treatment plants can handle that it
appears simply to be content to give
itself a general outline of how many
deposits it has rather than to prove
how big are those it has already found,
which it can do at its leisure.
How much has the situation changed
at WMC, then, since the February 1
statement that ore reserves had reached
9.3 million tons averaging 3.8 percent
nickel? This estimate was based on
only three shoots Lunnon (Kam-
balda East, which is the area now be-
preferred to explore other areas rather
than use its energies establishing exactly
how much ore it has north of the
proven area in the Durkin shoot. But
it seems clear that there is a lot more
ore in the Durkin shoot than 5.75
million tons.
In the Lunnon shoot, the first to be
mined, February’s ore reserves totalled
an estimated 2.45 million tons, averaging
4.2 percent nickel. The April interim
report gave no further news about
Lunnon, although reports indicated that
the company was building a causeway
out into Lake Lefroy to enable it to
drill for extensions of the shoot. In
last week’s report, two drill holes
stretching over a further 1000 ft. south-
east into the lake from the edge of
its February reserves showed a con-
tinuation of high-grade nickel (4.45 per-
cent in one hole) under the lake.
This gives further weight to earlier
THE CHARTIST SAYS: MR. WHIPPY’S original shareholders must have
felt “green” when prices fell from a high of 60c in 1965 to a low of 3c in late
1967. It subsequently formed an almost classic head and shoulders base reversal
pattern. Investors who bought at the lower levels have already seen a recovery to
20c and there is every possibility that prices will move up to the next target, about
30c in the short term, with a further major objective about 50c. Last sale price on
9.8.68—18c.

thoughts that perhaps the Lunnon shoot
spreads right under the lake. In any
event, these drill holes have clearly
established a significant increase in the
Lunnon’s reserves and indicate that the
company has come nowhere near de-
fining the limits of this shoot.
In the case of the Jan shoot, WMC
directors have been a little cavalier in
their treatment of their shareholders.
In February they reported that Jan
had 1.11 million tons of ore averaging
percent nickel. Apart from reporting
that * drilling was delineating the ore-
body, the April report added nothing
new. And then, in last week’s report,
came the blunt announcement that
drilling in the Jan shoot had been sus-
pended in April. The reason has since
been obtained from the company; the
drilling had established sufficient
reserves to provide for a mining opera-
tion on the shoot and there was no
need to prove any more ore at the
moment. This presumably means that
it has added something to February’s
total and that there is more for the
looking.
In addition to WMC not having
established the spread of the orebodies
in these three shoots, it has also not
attempted to find out the limits of
their depth. Most of the drilling seems
to have been done to depths less than
1000 feet, and there seems every indica-
tion that deep drilling to, say, the 4000-
foot level would reveal considerable
additions to reserves. The company
has given no indication of any enthusi-
asm about undertaking deep drilling
for this purpose at the present time,
as its immediate objectives are quite
different.
It is clear that WMC’s strategy at
the moment is to concentrate its
energies not on proving how much ore
is in its existing shoots but in estab-
lishing the existence of new shoots.
Since February, its drilling has been
heavily concentrated at Kambalda
West, where it appears to be establish-
ing four new shoots instead of the one
reported in February, and it has also
done some work to the north, where
two new shoots seem to be emerging.
It is significant that the February
report said of these three shoots (now
likely to turn into six), that drilling
had not advanced far enough to enable
estimates to be made, “but the results
to date are comparable to those in the
ore shoots which make up the present
reserves at a similar stage in drilling.”
This appears still to be the situation
following further good values in drill-
ing over the five months to June (last
week’s report was only to the end of
June and did not include any indica-
tions of results in the subsequent six
weeks) and it seems that these new
shoots are going to provide at least a
doubling of existing reserves eventually,
if everything goes well, quite apart
from the additions involved in exten-
sions to the existing shoots and the
other new areas now being prospected.
The drilling at Kambalda West has
brought very significant results. This
whole area was excluded from Feb-
ruary’s ore reserves, but it now seems
clear that it will eventually bring a
major addition once it is more clearly
defined. The April report had revealed
that one hole (KD2037) had come up
with some remarkable nickel values up
to 11.07 percent through 14.6 feet at
around the 300-foot mark. It is striking
that the only two holes reported last
week as having been drilled within 400
feet of KD2037 were KD2051, which
also revealed excellent nickel values of
9.78 percent through 6.7 feet at about
360 feet deep, and KD4016, which
came up with 5.64 percent through 15
feet at a depth of 870 feet (after going
through an impressive 115 feet of one
percent nickel immediately above it).
This seems to confirm the April report
that “the area appears to be folded in a
complex pattern with variable and often
steep dips so that at this stage the true
widths of the lodes intersected cannot
be assessed. There seem to be four
separate ore positions which will be
progressively investigated by close-
pattern drilling.”
In any event, the company has
released assays on results from 20 drill
holes in this area, giving evidence of
significant nickel-ore deposits. Some
reveal fairly low grades, but eight of
them reveal values better than three
percent,
Of the two new shoots to the north
of Kambalda township, WMC has been
concentrating its endeavors on the Otter
shoot, which is about 4000 feet west of
the Durkin shoot. In April, WMC
revealed that one of the four drill holes,
in the Otter shoot had encountered
80 feet of ore averaging 3.25 percent
nickel starting at only 70 feet below the
surface. The two successful holes re-
ported on this shoot since then have
only brought low nickel values up to
1.66 percent at similar shallow depths,,
although it is significant that one of
them was 4000 feet south of the first
hole, indicating a significant length to
the orebody. And there seems every
likelihood that since the end of June
these drills may have penetrated more
significant orebodies as they went
deeper into the nickel sulphides rather
than simply through the surface oxides,
It seems likely that the nearby
McMahon shoot will be the next area
to be examined, although there clearly
remains considerable work to be done
at Otter before a mineable reserve is
established. No drilling assays have
been reported from the McMahon
shoot in 1968; last year’s hole had only
moderate nickel grades in it.
But no matter how much nickel is
proven in the Kambalda West area or
at Otter and McMahon, it seems un-

likely to mean much to the company’s
rate of production in the short run. As
the company’s managing director, Mr.
W. M. Morgan, said in May, the com-
pany could not expedite the first stage
of development which would lift out-
put from the Durkin and Lunnon shoots
to an annual rate of 800,000 tons by
1970. But in the longer term, these
higher reserves will no doubt encourage
the company to add considerably to
productive capacity. And this it will
no doubt do in the 19705.
This is by no means the entire WMG
nickel story. Last week’s report also
confirmed the existence of two new
prospects south of Lake Lefroy. One
is North West Cooee (three miles from
WMC’s Jan shoot at Torquata), where
low-grade sulphide mineralisation was
intersected in the four holes completed
(to an unstated depth), the best con-
taining 6.8 feet of 1.07 percent nickel.
The other is the Tramways prospect
(nine miles south of Jan), where pre-
liminary surveys have yielded signs of
nickel sulphide mineralisation and de-
tailed surveys are now being concen-
trated on the area.
In addition, WMC is having a good
look at its lease adjoining Great
Boulder and North Kalgurli’s Scotia
success (it seems curious that WMC
should not have received a bit of a
market boost from its neighbors’ excel-
lent values last week). WMC has begun
a drilling program prospecting for
nickeliferous laterite in this Ora Banda-
Kunanalling-Broad Arrow area, where
extensive areas of laterite overlying
ultrabasic rocks (the host of nickel)
occur. The company’s annual report
may have some useful information on
these three prospects.
WMC is also continuing its explor-
ation for gold and base metals in three
States, but in particular has started
drilling in the Warburton area of W.A.,
which is regarded as an area of some
interest.
And all this is in addition to the
much-rumored copper strike that has
excited London investors so much in
recent months. If the company can
maintain the 4.8 percent values it dis-
covered in 2.5 feet of massive sulphides
in one of the three holes it had com-
pleted at East Kookynie (about 75
miles north of Kalgoorlie) by the end
of June, then its copper prospect will
be of major significance. But the other
two holes intersected only narrow shows
of mineralisation averaging only about
1 percent copper. Drilling is continuing
on the prospect, which at least indicated
that directors consider the prospect
sufficiently worth while to persist with.
But it does not need copper to justify
prices of $l3 for WMC.
Altogether then, the latest WMC
quarterly report is not a disappointing
document at all; far from it. It shows
WMC’s strategy clearly and the fact
that it is not a strategy that appeals to
speculators does not mean it is against
the best interests of those investors who

want to hold on to the stock. The
reality is that it is much more- impor-
tant for the company to find out how
many potential nickel mines it has
under its belt than to fuss about estab-
lishing how big exactly are the reserves
on those deposits it already knows are
large enough to sustain a mine.
So the company’s next report, in-
dicating how its drilling progress has
been in its six potential mines at west
and north Kambalda and at its two
prospects south of Lake Lefroy, how
its prospecting has gone at Ora Banda
and how its copper search -has progres-
sed at Kookynie, will be an important
document. If its drilling shows good
results, it will be immaterial (except
for more excitable investors) whether
the company makes some stab at its
then current nickel reserves position or
not; any estimate would probably be
shortly proved wrong, anyway. The
whole area seems to be so laced with
nickel that the company will probably
never really define its limits.
DROUGHT RESULTS
UN-EARNED DIVIDENDS
THE TROUBLE ABOUT buying for
recovery shares that have been hit by
Victoria’s recently ended drought is that
if you buy them before the issue of the
1967-68 results there’s a good chance of
getting a buffeting when the horrible
truth is revealed. Also, there’s the strong
possibility of a long wait while higher
profits are generated in the recovery
period. These considerations shouldn’t
deter the long-term investor, but they
are hardly conducive to attracting the
short-term ones who have such a power-
ful influence on the market these days.
There’s another deterring thought, too,
in that every rise in price is bound
to entice tired holders out. In other
words, there’s a sort of built-in brake
on the share price to take account of
and there’s no everyman’s guide to the
manner of its operation.
Of course, not all or probably even
the majority of drought-stricken shares
are going to drop on the appearance of
hard figures from the leanest of years.
This is largely because the market has
already discounted the Door perform-
ance and partly because some people
will buy on hearing that sort of bell. It
also helps when, as Dennys Lascelles,
the Geelong woolbroker and stock and
land agent who has been in the front-
line of the State’s drought, has done, a
company continues to pay a pretty good
dividend despite not having earned it.
In its case, earnings dropped to a mere
6.8 percent in the year just ended, but
the company dipped into reserves and
paid 12| percent for the year. There’s
nothing wrong with that, because as the
report rightly says dividend distributions
have been conservative in the fat years
enabling it to accumulate strong
reserves.

WAITING FOR ACl's
EXPANSIONS TO PROFIT
THE SHAREHOLDERS
THE POSSIBILITY of a share issue
this year, and of a competitor in the
glass field, make Australian Consoli-
dated Industries Ltd. more than
usually interesting.
At the annual meeting next week the
chairman should divulge his plans for
new funds, which are obviously needed.
A share issue is not a foregone con-
clusion.
And perhaps he will comment on
the possibility of an invasion of the
glass-bottles business which ACI has
had on its own for so long. Even for a
company which may have extensive
leases of sand (Kathleen Investments
is rumored to be the local company
linked with Ball Bros, of the U.S.)
and with the biggest technical and
financial help from overseas, entry in-
volves no mean expediture. A competi-
tor would probably only interrupt
ACl’s profit trend line with a dent
for a couple of years.
The decline in liquidity evidenced
in the current ratio results from a
heavy capital expenditure program
($16.6 million in 1968 alone) and the
■expansion of business which demanded
$2.9 million more for debtors and $1.2
million for extra stocks, turning a cash
position of $l.l million in 1967 to an
overdraft of $6.2 million, and extending
trade creditors by $3.2 million.
Just how much the basic business
has grown in recent years is hard to
determine because, being the only pro-
ducer of glass, there are no Government
production statistics, and group sales
are not disclosed, even though these
would be well disguised by the diversi-
fied interests in which ACI is now big-
time. But any thought that the activities
outside glass (that is, plastics, engineer-
ing, fibre containers and wooden cases,
insulating and building materials, re-
fractories, and so on) are overtaking
the glass business in importance is
probably wide of the mark. The bulk
of recent investment seems to have
gone into its glass business.
The startling figure of $66.7 million
for total gross investment in plant, land,
and buildings in the past five years has
been provided from retained earnings,
heavy depreciation, and a $l2 million
debenture issue in February, 1966.
(This was quite apart from a $7 million
increase in investments, mostly the
acquisition of F. W. Williams, which
was satisfied by the issue of $3.3 million
shares and payment of $525,000.) The
1968 expenditure has not yet been
itemised, but much of it went on extra
glass furnaces, some of which run into
millions of dollars. (One opened at
Spotswood this month.)
The company has announced a $4
million program of expenditure in fibre-
glass, to cut production costs and
broaden the base of its manufacture at
Dandenong. Commitments for capital
expenditure not provided for in the
1968 accounts were $4.75 million com-
pared with $3.8 million the year
before, so it would be optimistic to feel
that the company’s huge investment
program was levelling off.
The company has to maintain its
capacity to supply not only an increas-
ing volume of products but those of
higher quality to meet the growing
expectations of customers. Should ACI
acquire a competitor in glass, it would
be safe to say its capital expenditure
would accelerate rather than decline.
The per capita usage of glass con-
tainers is fast closing the gap with U.S.

usage, and it is rising ahead of the
increase in gross national product. Being
subject to the invasions of tins and
plastic containers, increasing costs,
especially in higher wage rates, have
to be swallowed. Stubbies have recap-
tured some of the beer market lost to
cans (88 percent of beer comes in
glass) and are now running neck and
neck with the one-pint can over all Aus-
tralia; it has also won back some of
the market for aerated and carbonated
waters.
ACI does not talk about it much,
but it is a great miner and quarry-
master, obtaining limestone from its
own deposits at Nowa Nowa (Vic.) and
Berrima (N.S.W.), dolomite from Mt.
Fairy, near Goulburn (N.S.W.), silica
sand from Lang Lang (Vic.), Gosford
(N.S.W.), Stradbroke Island (Qld.),
and near Perth, Adelaide, and Hobart,
felspar from Kalgoorlie (W.A.) and
Bathurst (N.S.W.), and kaolin and fire
clay from Home Rule (N.S.W.). (It
also has been recently exposed as a
potential miner in New Zealand, with
titles to a scheelite field near Otago,
which could justify a multi-million-
dollar industry.)
A technical assistance agreement with
Owens-Illinois, the largest glass con-
tainer manufacturer in the world with
43 percent of the U.S. market, will
undoubtedly bring benefits in glass
production and marketing. In prolong-
ing the life of glass furnaces which now
have to be rebuilt every four or five
years, Owens-Illinois may be able to
help materially.
Flat glass, in which ACI is partnered
by the U.K. Pilkington group, which
has a 17 percent direct and a 16.32
percent indirect interest in AWG, has
benefited from the revival of the build-
ing industry. Australian Window Glass
plans to penetrate the domestic market
for double-glazed units, which are
already well established in the commer-
cial field. With the increasing accept-
ance of oil-heating and air-conditioning,
the scope here is tremendous. The
sheet-glass furnaces at Alexandria and
Dandenong have now been converted
to the Pittsburgh process.
The production of fibreglass by Aus-
tralian Fibre Glass Pty Ltd., in which
Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corporation
has a 40 percent interest, is being
expanded by the construction of a
chemical factory to make the company’s
own resins, sizes, and plastisols for
fibreglass wool and textile products, the
installation of a direct-melt process for
textiles, and the extension of the wool-
manufacturing line. A majority interest
was acquired in Reinforced Plastics
Pty. Ltd. in July, 1968, which intends
to exploit markets in body panelling for
the motor industry, in tyre reinforce-
ments, storage tanks, and insulated ship-
ping containers.
In fibre packaging, ACI figures it is
one of the biggest operators in the
country. This is a fast-growing and
profitable sector of ACl’s activities.
As St. Regis of the U.S. is a half-
owner of St. Regis-ACI Pty. Ltd., and
a one-third owner of St Regis-ACI
(NZ) Ltd. (since the amalgamation of
Flexible Packaging Ltd. with ACI-St.
Regis Sisalkraft and flexible laminates
business), ACI is quaintly reluctant to
say much about these operations,
although it admits to being very active.
In 1966-67 St. Regis of the U.S. also
took up a one-third interest in the ACI
fibre packaging interests in Western
Australia, Victoria, and Queensland,
which were incorporated separately as
Amalgamated Packaging Pty. Ltd.
ACI increased its market share for
some major plastic products in 1967-
68. It makes moulded PVC bottles,
laminates, vinyl flooring (since 1964-
65), and agricultural piping, which has
a growing market.
New Zealand operations include glass
manufacture, plastics, flexible and fibre
packaging, and engineering. Although
N.Z. devaluation affected group profits
by $574,000 in 1968 (and net assets
were reduced by $2.7 million), the com-
pany was cheerful about results and is
expanding its interests there.
The company intends to make glass
containers and metal closures, and cor-
rugated fibreboard containers in New
Guinea for local use.
Investment in Singapore and Malay-
sia is through a 51.7 percent interest in
Malaysian Containers Ltd. A $2-million
glass plant was opened at Kuala
Lumpur a couple of weeks ago. The
company also has invested in glass
manufacturing and engineering in
Thailand.
The engineering activities developed
from ACl’s own service departments,
and the company is now big in struc-
tural and other heavy steelwork, light
metal working, and bright steel. It
rationalised the latter business in June
by the sale of Charles Hope of Bris-
bane and Brunton Steel’s N.S.W. works
to Martin Bright Steel. Its new partner
in David Lennox Australia Pty. Ltd.
(fabricated plate structures and struc-
tural steel) is Johns and Waygood Perry
Engineering Ltd., on a 50-50 basis. The
49 percent interest in Harbsion-ACI
refractories was a derivation of the
glass business, also.
After ACI had written down its
investment in Coramic Australia Pty.
Ltd. by $1 million in 1967 (a transfer
from special reserves), ACI and Email,
the joint owners, merged this ceramic-
tile business with the Australian opera-
tions of Richards Tiles Ltd., and ACl’s
share is now a 12| percent holding in
Richards Coramic Pty. Ltd.
The company’s investments, both
listed and otherwise, have grown at
book value from a total $11.5 million
in 1964 to $19.5 million in 1968, but
market value of the $6.3 million listed
investments at last balance date
exceeded book value by $7.7 million.

bought in 1967-68 at $1.50, which have
trebled in value.
Some of the other investments in
companies which are not subsidiaries
could be substantially undervalued, as
they are shown at cost in the books.
The return from investments has
improved from 5.4 percent in 1966 to
9 percent in 1968. The company would
not comment on suggestions that it
could liquidate the $2-million Govern-
ment securities to improve its cash
position.
Only $3.9 million of freeholds are
mortgaged, and total secured liabilities
of $15.9 million compare with share
capital of $49.3 million and share-
holders’ funds of $ll2 million, but
directors promised to decide this year
on the best way of raising more funds,
keeping the best interests of the share-
holders and the company in mind.
The last share issue was a one-for-
five at 50 percent premium in Novem-
ber, 1961, when a one-for-two bonus
was made simultaneously.
The disturbing feature for share-
holders is that in the past four years
salaries and wages paid by the com-
pany have increased by $13.9 million,
while profits available to ACI have only
grown by $1.4 million, and dividends
by $BOO,OOO. As one of the biggest
employers of labor in the nation (about
13,000 of a group total of 17,000), any
public talk about economising on labor
is considered by the company as politi-
cal dynamite. But that is certainly
where the company should be focusing
its attention.
The 2100 increase in the total num-
ber on the group’s payroll since 1964
of course reflects the acquisitions of
other companies and general expansion.
The expansion and diversification
from the initial concentration in glass
products to other key industries, plastics,
corrugated fibreboard, cartons, and con-
tainers, and to engineering reflects
credit on the management, as does the
range of glass items manufactured,
which is wider than that found in many
large glass-manufacturing enterprises
overseas. Its endeavors overseas are also
admirable.
But this growth has not brought much
reward to shareholders lately, and
declared profits have shown a pretty
steady earning rate. So if directors
again by-pass shareholders in their
search for funds, although borrowing
would be more economical and better
for shareholders in the long run, the
market is liable to be disappointed.

MORE SCOPE FOR
OSH'S ENTHUSIASM
FOR NEW PRODUCTS
THE STORY IS that Osti Holdings,
one of Australia’s three largest tricot
knitting groups, could double its turn-
over in 1968-69 and show a greatly im-
proved profit rate, which makes me
enthusiastic about this stock. Knitting
is one of the fastest-growing sectors in
the textile industry and basically con-
sists of two different types of construc-
tion, in warp knitting and weft knit-
ting. Tricot, a type of warp-knit
fabric, has shown substantial gains aided
by new high-speed machines, new stitch
formations, an increasing range of tex-
tured yarns, and by the development of
bonded and laminated techniques. The
combination of all these advances has
made it possible for warp-knit fabrics
to be introduced in bulk to markets
which for centuries were supplied
entirely by woven-textile mills. In
Britain, it is expected that knitted
textiles of all types will capture close
to two-thirds of the total fabric market
by 1975, outselling woven fabrics by
two to one. This trend is also develop-
ing in Australia.
My understanding is that Osti’s take
off in 1968-69 is expected to come from
a combination of three factors, one of
which is likely to involve the acquisi-
tion of a controlling interest in two
privately owned knitting factories in
Sydney, which would have the impact
of increasing the group’s current annual
usage of synthetic yarns from about
one million pounds to two and a half
million pounds. The trend toward
mergers and acquisitions in the textile
industry, which has snowballed in
Britain, Europe, Japan, and the United
States, has now come to Australia with
a bang, following Dunlop’s takeover of
Prestige and the less-publicised move by
Courtaulds to put under the one
umbrella the Melbourne firms of
Kayser, Lucas, Siggins, and Morley.
Knitted textiles, already dominant in
hosiery, underwear, swimwear, and a
growing force in shirts and nightwear,
are now also strong in dress and blouse
fabrics, and are expected to increasingly
displace woven textiles in women’s
outerwear and in apparel linings. Over-
seas textile houses now report that
markets so far untapped to knitters are
opening up in men’s outerwear, especi-
ally jackets and slacks, in home furn-
ishings, and in fabrics for industrial
uses. The idea of tailored knitted suits
may seem strange at first, but it is
catching on overseas, and it should not
be too long before they make their
presence felt in Australia.
The current growth of knitgoods in
Australia is in excess of ten percent a
year. Osti Holdings is in a strong
position to exploit the expansion pros-
pects ahead, because of its lead in tech-
nological development. The company
is a vertical - integrated - knitgoods
manufacturer, with its own dyeing and
finishing facilities; the mills knit fabrics,
dye or finish them, and produce under-
wear, dresses, and nightwear from their
own fabrics. Osti also operate the
largest custom textile finishing plant in
Sydney, including processes for dyeing,
preshrinking, along with chemical
finishings for water - repellency, fire-
resistance, and mildew - proofing
Another major activity is in the manu-
facture of bedspreads, and Osti’s sub-
sidiary Quiltair is one of Australia’s
majors in this product area. In current
size, Osti produces knitted fabrics at
the rate of over 150,000 square yards
each week, dyeing and finishing of pro-
cessed fabrics are turned out at the
rate of 250,000 square yards each week,
while 15,000 dozen garments are also
made up each week.
Osti was founded in 1939 by Mr.
Frank Theeman, an Austrian with ex-
perience in his family’s textile business
in Vienna (the family background in
textiles goes back to 1880). Theeman
w r as forced to flee from the Nazi take-
over of Austria in 1938, and was virtu-
ally penniless, but a stroke of luck was
his meeting Timothy O’Sullivan, an
Australian horse owner and trainer,
whose keenness for punting led him to
bankroll Theeman in a garment
making-up business in Sydney. The
name Osti comes from the combination
of the surnames O’Sullivan and Thee-
man. Within a month after arrival in
Sydney, Theeman was in business with
a staff of seven people and a capital
of S7OO. In 1959, Osti Holdings listed
as a public company, and since its first
year of public status, in 1960, share-
holders’ funds have expanded by 2.9
times, total assets employed by 1.7
times, turnover by 2.5 times, and profit
for ordinary by 1.3 times.
Frank Theeman (now 55) is still at
the company helm as chairman and
managing director, but he is no one-
man-band operation, and he is ably
assisted by about 20 key executives
whose average age is about 35. There
are eight processing centres in the
group, six in Sydney, and two in the
country at Kurri Kurri and Woy
Woy and distribution is carried out
by agents in all States. Group employ-
ment is around 1000.
Osti’s main claim to prominence in
the Australian textile industry has
revolved around its skill and enthusiasm
for developing new techniques. The
company was one of the first in Aus-
tralia to climb aboard the galloping
nylon market in the early 19505, with
its production of nylon fabrics. In
recent years Osti has been a pioneer
in developing schreinered nylon (very
fine satin-like, but not transparent,
luxurious nylon fabric), nylon batiste
(all-nylon fabric combining the cool
moisture-absorbing qualities of cotton,
with the strength and quick-drying

properties of nylon, and the knitted
dress fabrics.
In garments, Osti holds about 22-26
percent of the total Australian lingerie
market, but in the $3 retail and up
bracket, their share is about 50 percent.
Dresses and sleepwear are other impor-
tant lines, but Osti now depends on the
garments division for only about 30
percent of group profit. The company
has about 50 percent of the fashioned-
bedspread business in Australia in the
better-quality range from sl2 retail
and up, and these sales are growing
at the rate of about ten percent a
year. Bedspreads are ceasing to be
a utilitarian product, and fast becom-
ing a decorator and showpiece item in
many Australian bedrooms. Matching
curtains and bedspreads is another line.
In their fabric division, the company
has added to the range this year with
two new products in knitted upholstery,
furnishing fabrics and knitted laces.
There was practically no lace industry
in Australia until Osti recently set up
facilities. Now two of Australia’s largest
bra manufacturers are customers.
Newtown Dyers and Bleachers, the
group subsidiary in textile finishings,
has installed one of the most modern
plants in Australia in developing
finishes designed to impart increased
attractiveness and utility to textiles,
including effective crease-resistant
properties. Osti quickly jumped on to
the bonded - fabrics bandwagon a
couple of years ago with their patented
Coin bonding process. In the United
States, bonded fabrics have shown a
growth of 15 times over the past five
years, and the U.S. market is expected
to double again by 1970.
Possibly the most exciting new de-
velopment in Osti’s current expansion
has been in the formation of the sub-
sidiary Osti-Bolton to manufacture
disposable non-woven garments. Osti
holds a 51 percent interest in the
venture, with Bolton Textile Mill
Britain and Stevens-Bolton, U.S.A., also
as shareholders. Osti-Bolton will com-
mence production of throw-away
garments with an initial production of
20,000 dozen women’s and girls’ pants
each week. Selling at 3 for 29 cents,
the disposable pants, made of a com-
bination of synthetics and reinforced
paper, are expected to open up an
almost unlimited market for throw-
away undergarments, particularly when

associated with the advantages of con-
venience and no washing, in conditions
where travel, vacations, and feminine
hygiene are involved. Osti-Bolton’s
franchise covers not only Australia and
New Zealand but the whole of the
Pacific and Asian area.
Pre-tax profit has not advanced to
any extent in recent years, due to the
costs involved in a vast modernisation
program, but it would not surprise if
some of the fruits of the past en-
deavors showed up in the 1967/68
accounts, and my hunch is that pre-
tax profit could be up by as much as
20 percent and profit for ordinary
based on a normal tax provision by
about ten percent. But the real profit
advance should come in 1969.
Summary: At $1.50 the shares show
a dividend yield of 5 percent and
the price earnings ratio is 10.9. This
stock has outstanding possibilities and
I would buy at this price.

Milligan’s semantic minefield
Spike Milligan ... his roots in reality
By SANDRA WALKER
EVEN in the tranquillity of Orange
Grove Road, Woy Woy, conversation
with Spike Milligan is a semantic mine-
field.
“How long are you in Australia?”
“Five foot eleven.
“I’m sorry,” he says, delighted, “but
the English language is full of these
pitfalls and I’m always looking for
them.”
Anyway, he goes on, Orange Grove
Road is hardly tranquil these days.
There’s the indecision about the best
time to leave to catch the 10.25 bus
that actually goes at 10.35, the weekend
trippers with their sportscars and in-
datable plastic girlfriends and the dog
CU iV l n- the " eX u St , ree . t ' . ...
Milligan is back in Australia from
London for a month to visit his parents
at Woy Woy. It takes time to steer him
round to talk of his new television
series, his film The Bed Sitting Room,
and scheme for another TV program,
because we must first see the view from
t e top o the i . . .
So we drive jokingly and precipi-
tously up a half-exisi.ent track until the
whole of the bay stretches below.
Milligan, straw-hatted with his shirt
napping in the wind, is out of the car.
Don t tell me you re going to be like
the English, who sit in their cars to look
at a view they go from London to
Brighton and back with the same smoke
in tneir cars.
Then back down the hill, and over
his third cup of tea in an hour he s at
last talking about humor. It can
happen spontaneously. I was sitting over
in that chair the last time I was here,
writing a letter, and suddenly found
myself telling a story about a man
whose right foot started to sing in a
bus. He tried to stop the noise by
tightening his shoelaces, but all that
did was to make the voice go higher—
castrati. So there he was, walking down
the street with his foot singing ‘God
Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen. 5
“All the jokes have roots in reality.
There’s this line I started in London.
You say to someone, ‘Good night, keep
taking the tablets.’ And they break up,
because most people are taking tablets
of some kind. There’s another one I
call the ‘sympathy, hump,’ which
developed out of a sore leg I had. I
got so much sympathy from people that
I didn’t want the leg to get better.
“So I invented the hump. You get
this ru bber bladder, put it on your back
under your shirt, then when you’re in
a crowded bus you press a bulb in your
foot and pump it up gradually, so in
the end you’re bowed down by this
great thing and someone gets up and
gives you a seat. And for women there’s
t hi s false pregnancy thing, works the
same way.”
j t now adou t ten y Cars s i nce Milli-
gan> Peter Sellers, and Harry SeC ombe
dissolved their partnership in Goonery,
and Milligan is curiously self-effacing
when he talks about it.
“I’d been writing the stuff for six
years and I just felt I couldn’t go on
with it. Better to end the show while
it was s till riding high than choke it
alive as the BBC wante d to. But I’m
gregarious. I’d got used to working with
the others, and when it ended I felt as
if I were finished. They were always
the successes. In 1960 I came out here,
and when I got back Peter was big m
films and Secombe had a TV series. I
never believed in myself at all.
“Very humble, I was . . .” and he
takes off on an excursion into Goonery
while his father, Captain Milligan,
recalls a film Spike did at the time
about a postman’s immortal combat
with a mail-sorting machine.
“Did you see that?” Milligan says.
“You know, I never have. I laid an
egg in it, although I’m told they liked
it in Mexico. I’d made one film before
for MGM, in which I did exactly what
they told me and it was dreadful. So
I thought I’d put in a few of my own
ideas that would be funny. But I
couldn’t stand working for the Ameri-
cans. There was this terrible man with
no sense of humor, a completely techno-
logical mind. He’d watch the rushes
without laughing at anything, just say-
ing things like the light was wrong,
And I’d think—so what, you can tell
jokes in the dark.”
Milligan has never worked in
America, and although there is a possi-
bility he’ll do his West End hit “Son
of Oblomov” on Broadway he is not
happy at the prospect. “They’ve been
trying to make up their minds about
it for the past three years and they’re
still talking about it for next season,
But if I go I don’t think I’ll unpack,
They won’t like it.”
Milligan’s first West End hit was
“The Bed Sitting Room,” the film of
which he has just completed with Rita
Tushingham, Michael Hordern, Ronald
Fraser, Peter Cook, and Dudley Moore
(“They’re in everything the National
Anthem next week”). Richard Lester,
of “The Knack” and “How I Won
the War,” is the director.
“ H e’s a rather cold fish to work with,
completely occupied with the visual
side of the film and doesn > t do an thin
t 0 excavate his actors,” Milligan said,
°
. 1 'Sf 11 s . °“ lc e in Bayswater is
equipped with a typewriter, tape-
recorder, and piano. He writes (a chil-
dren’s book at the moment), composes
music, and paints, working each day
from 9 a.m. onward. He has few
close friends in show business (the
Beatles’ record producer, George Mar-


tin, is one), but says London theatrical
cliques are well defined, with strong
power.
People who attract him, he says, are
those with some feeling left for nature
. . . the same feeling that moved him
to spend three years of Saturday after-
noons restoring delicate carvings done
years ago in the trunk of an ancient
oak in Kensington Gardens “the
only childlike thing in the park. Every
time the statue of Queen Victoria out-
side the royal apartments loses a finger,
they rush to replace it, but they were
going to let this tree rot.”
The project, Milligan might say, had
its roots in reality, which puts things
right back in that semantic minefield
where he lives.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
SLICK AND PLASTIC
Don’t Drink the Water. Woody Allen.
Independent Theatre, Sydney.
Present Laughter. Noel Coward. Palace
Theatre, Sydney.
I’VE HAD THIS terrific idea for a
TV series. It’s a situation-comedy show
set in an American Embassy inside the
“Iron Curtain.” (Do they still call it
that? Well, anyway, in this series
they do.) The Ambassador’s son is in
charge of the embassy; he’s a dumb
kid, but lovable. In runs this typical
American family (father loud shirt,
mother pointy sunglasses, beautiful
daughter) they’re tourists mistakenly
accused of being spies. The thing is,
they have to stay there, in asylum, for
maybe years (seasons). Boy-girl situ-
ation young love, he falls over his
feet a lot, but she helps him. Then
there’d be a lot of business with funny
escapes, and odd characters (like Agnes
Moorehead, say, on a guest spot) who’d
also stumble in and maybe get to stay
on if reaction was good. You see what
I mean it’s topical, romantic, and
a load of laughs all in one.
Actually, though, Woody Allen had
the idea first, and the pilot episode is
on stage at the Independent, masquer-
ading as a play. The script is solid
gags several are very funny, several
are singularly tasteless. The characters
conceived to deliver them are straight
cardboard. Only Father Drobney
(Harry Lawrence) the priest with
the card-tricks has a hint of fresh-
ness. The production (Peter Summer-
ton and Michael Lake) moves them
about the usual Independent set with
reasonable aplomb, but I could see no
valid reason for the exercise. I’d never
watch it on TV.
Anthony Sharp has provided Phillip
Productions with as glossily commercial
a version of “Present Laughter” as
Sydney can muster. To convert a fusty
old 1943 commercial success into a
1968 one Mr. Sharp has, first of all,
carefully updated the text: 1922 is
called 1951, Lord Baldwin is called
Harold Macmillan, Toscanini is called
Barbirolli, Regent’s Park is called
Coronation Street,- the phrase
“Colonial propaganda” is tactfully
tidied away, and instead of coppers we
look for sixpences for the telephone.
Whenever possible, comedy is under-
lined: when, for instance, the central
character, Garry Essendine (i.e.
Coward), acts out a renunciation scene
to get rid of the girl he has picked up
the night before, lines like “» . . please
come here now and kiss me once, just
once, and then go” are reinforced by
the actor’s looking at his watch while
embracing her.
Within the scope of this sort of
treatment. the actors are all perfectly
competent. Stuart Wagstaff’s self-
satisfied mask is well cast, and among
the women only Patricia Leehy seems to
rely a little too heavily on the “Noel
Coward” voice that everyone adopts.
Peter Rowley, as the unfortunate play-
wright, contrives to make his character
seem a little more than a dialogue
mouthpiece, although, even here, I
wonder if a comic handshake was really
necessary.
In general, then, “Present Laughter”
is given the sort of treatment proper
to any new West End comedy, and the
only problem is that this one is 25
years old, and looks every day of it.
No amount of retouching its “Union
Castles” as “P & O’s” can turn “You’d
drive me mad in a week, but you are
to me the most charming, infuriating,
passionately attractive man I have ever
known in my life” into contemporary
dialogue. Perhaps this ugly inconsis-
tency between basic style and surface
detail is of no great concern to a com-
mercial management. But the current
revival of interest in Coward’s plays
Stuart Wagstaff and Sue Becker in
“Present Laughter”
(which no doubt prompted the present
productions) is based, at least in part,
on a serious reassessment of his work,
and plays like “Hay Fever” are seen as
the most significant comic writing of
their period.
Since no one would now attempt to
divorce a play like “The Importance
of Being Earnest” from its period, it
seems a pity that “Present Laughter”
should have been flogged out with a
glass eye and false hair and not been
accorded the respect due to its age and
new-found respectability. If I seem to
labor this point it is because this
“festival” of two plays has some pre-
tentions to being a serious revival of
Coward’s work and because the pro-
fessional skill of the cast and the
general gloss of the production go a
long way toward obscuring the faulty
nature of the whole undertaking.
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
REFINING A MILGATE
A Refined Look at Existence. Rodney
Milgate. Sheridan Theatre, Adelaide.
THE SHERIDAN THEATRE is cur-
rently playing Rodney Milgate’s “A
Refined Look at Existence” direct, as
it were, from the Old Tote. It is a
play about which enough has really
been said, though on the second time
round, and in the hands of a different
director and cast, it was interesting to
compare productions and to pick out
more clearly the ingredients in Mr.
Milgate’s not at all refined >— rather,
coarsely chopped salad.
The Sheridan production has been
approached on broadly similar lines to
the Old Tote’s, but to my mind it
comes much closer to making the script
a play. Jenni James’ set has very clean
lines, with its bare deal plank contruc-
tions, brown-paper side walls, pasted
newsprint background, and carefully
nondescript vulgar furniture. David
Griggs’ direction gives the play a
cohesion it lacked in Sydney, smoothly
leading his cast in and out of the various
slabs of naturalism, farce, and labored
poetry and letting them play one step
outside formal characterisations. In
fact, the cast generally caricature their
roles in a way that strengthens the
comic elements at the expense of the
coffee-lounge philosophy.
Dawn Langman’s Igave is excel-
lently simple-minded, even pathetic in
the last scene, while Bill Holdsworth’s
Jovey is a precise piece of square-jawed
Australiana, a refugee from “Dad and
Dave.” Only Ken Conway’s Donny
lacks real strength, for where he should
be as flamboyant and even suggestive
as, say, P. J. Proby, he is as proper and
gentle as one of the Four Aces.
But sitting there working out the
myth it’s Euripides’ “Bacchae,”
the philosophy, generally existential if
it’s not Sartre’s, and the echoes, pos-
sibly of Alfred Jarry I was struck
this time with how close Mr. Milgate
comes to creating real, exciting theatre,
and how right at the moment when
nothing else need be said or done he
suddenly launches into a sermon larded
with poetic banality. It’s a pity. “A
Refined Look at Existence” has within
its ramblings about three very interest-
ing plays, provided the ideas are re-
fined, disciplined, and critically
thought out.


The etchings
of a
landscapist
PHOTOGRAPHY BY ROBERT WALKER
Painter Fred Williams at work on a
characteristic landscape in the country
around his home at Upwey, Victoria
FRED WILLIAMS sees himself as
“just a fat man who likes to eat and
to paint on the side.” As some of his
paintings sell for more than $2500 it
would seem that he can afford to eat
well off his sideline. But Williams’
modesty is genuine. Although the con-
sensus is inclining to rate him as Aus-
tralia’s leading landscapist, he is reluc-
tant to talk about art, particularly his
own.
His home is at Upwey, in the
Dandenongs, and it’s from the country
around his spacious split-level home
that most of his striking landscapes
spring. “I’m not a bushman,” he says.
“Nor am I very fond of the bush.
The Simpson Desert does not appeal to
me. I’m always glad to get back home;
it is my favorite part of Australia.”
He was born in Melbourne 40 years
ago and studied at the National Gal-
lery Schools. From there he went to
England for six years, studying first
at the Chelsea Art School and then
at the Central School of Arts, London.
His list of exhibitions and accumula-
tion of prizes was impressive even be-
fore he won the Helena Rubinstein
Travelling Art Scholarship in 1963.
His vision of the Australian land-
scape at first appears to be an
“Performer in a Top
Hat” (right), one of a
series of music-hall
scenes from Fred Wil-
liams’ books of etchings
Below, “Comedian,”

cinates Williams. He witnessed the dying
stages of the English music hall; admired
comedian Max Miller
Above, Williams with his youngest daugh-
ter, Louise, and (left) hiking through the
Dandenongs...“Daddy is a policeman"
assembly of daubs. As the uninitiated
eye becomes adjusted to the view it
is looking at pictures of the burnt,
charred, dried, and bravely glowing
landscape. Sometimes there’s an implied
suggestion of courageous human life in
the far distance beyond the stunted and
fallen trees, but nothing moves.
Williams’ unusual, almost formless,
style suggests to all but the initiated
the feeling that he might be less pro-
ficient at drawing than he is at paint-
ing. That uncertainty is settled in a
book of Williams’ etchings about to be
published by Rudy Komon, the Syd-
ney art gallery owner who “discovered”
Williams seven years ago and has been
investing in him ever since. The 132-
page book has been printed in Sydney
and contains 72 black-and-white and
sepia plates (some of which are repro-
duced on this page) and a definitive
catalogue compiled by James Mollison
illustrating and detailing 246 etchings
in all their states. Says Daniel Thomas
in a preface: “Williams has produced
a body of prints to rival previous
Australian artists Sydney Long, Lionel
Lindsay, Norman Lindsay, and Mar-
garet Preston.”
One day his three children will be
impressed by it all. Now, though, “I
think they’re a bit ashamed of their
father being an artist . . . you know,
not going out to work. The eldest two
have told the other children around
the way that daddy is a policeman.”

MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
FRINGE BENEFITS
LOOKING around the sparsely
populated auditoriums at the majority
of recitals given by our local musicians,
one often wonders if altruism, courage,
or desperation prompts their activity,
for few can clear expenses and many
must find themselves out of pocket.
If these concerts were musically un-
rewarding or suffered from an excess
of irritating amateurism there would
be some reason for the lack of patron-
age by the music-loving public, but very
often they prove to be most rewarding
and have a freshness which is a distinct
relief from the streamlined and over-
burnished work of visiting celebrities.
The classic reason for not shooting the
pianist does not apply, for their best,
while admittedly not up with the
Arraus, Ashkenazys, and Rubinsteins,
can often be as revelatory.
It is probably true that the tremen-
dous growth of the recording industry
has accustomed people to a breath-
taking standard of technical excellence,
but it is also true that it creates a
climate where the performance becomes
standardised in the mind of the listener
except, of course, for the record fiend
with a prodigious collection containing
many versions of the same work. A
different light can illuminate new facets
of a work to an astonishing degree, and
these revelations are often experienced
in the recitals of our unpretentious and
dedicated locals.
On a night of formidable opposition
“The Turn of the Screw” at the
University of New South Wales (which
I will review next week), the ballet at
Her Majesty’s, and Pavel Guerdjikov
at the Town Hall William Coombes
essayed the greatest song cycle, “Winter-
reise,” of Schubert at the Conserv-
atorium. These songs, sung adequately,
can be as disturbing as the last String
Quartets of Beethoven, for there are
times when the mixture of warm pas-
sion and gothic chill of the romantic
verse 'is transcended in a remarkable
way by Schubert’s visionary settings.
Mr. Coombes sang many of the songs
beautifully indeed, particularly those
which required a controlled mezzo
voce, but his voice is inclined to lose
quality when hard driven. This fault,
however, could not hide the careful and
devoted preparation which had gone
into this recital. There can be few
singers in Australia who could carry
off this cycle, but Mr. Coombes un-
doubtedly did, although I am sure he
would be the first to admit that he
has a long way to go before he can
fully realise the dark tumult of “Erstar-
rung,” the ambivalence of “Ruckblick”
or the anguish of “Einsamkeit.”
Not the least factor in the success of
the recital was the sensitive and per-
ceptive preces of the poems of the
cycle by the late Paul Williams, past
president of the Schubert Society, whose
death deprived us of a gentle and
kindly scholar.


BALLET/CAROLYN SYMES
FENCE-SITTING
Dancers in “Sun Music” ... shattering influences
The Australian Ballet. Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Sydney.
THERE IS MUCH to be said in
praise of “Sun Music,” but I cannot
describe it as true ballet. It is divorced
from the formalised classicism Aus-
tralian ballet inherited from Europe,
but it is dance theatrical dance -
intricately conceived by choreographer
Sir Robert Helpmann. It is an advance
on all his earlier works of adventurous
choreography, presumably aimed at
•catching up with the modern move-
ment disseminated by America. There
is no story-line and a program note
states there is no dramatic connection
between the five movements Soil,
Mirage, Growth, Energy, and Destruc-
tion; this, in essence, is a break from
the classical traditions.
But Sir Robert has not made a
clean break, because the intended theme
of the power of the sun on the elements
builds a narrative through the sequence
of movements; it is something for the
mind to latch on to. And I am sure it
was not without intent that he infused
all except the middle movement,
“Growth,” , with an Australian flavor,
which further binds the narrative.
I don’t feel this is an intrinsic fail-
ure to reach a goal but rather a
thoughtful understanding of the in-
ability, as yet, of the mass of Australian
ballet lovers to accept a complete
transition. Instead, Helpmann is
cajoling ballet subscribers while at the
same time affording himself the luxury
of exercising his theatrical temperament
by creating a compelling spectacle of
dramatic movement with patriotic, if
rather hackneyed and gimmicky,
symbolism.
The fact that this work is a co-
operative effort by three Australians—
composer Peter Sculthorpe, designer
Kenneth Rowell, and Sir Robert—
confirms an aim to project Australian-
ism into a world-class theatrical per-
formance; the enthusiasm and fusion
with which the artists of the Australian
Ballet perform combines to make it
that. But by its tentative approach to
the modern trend it is imitating, it
neither reaches a peak nor initiates
an original off-shoot of the trend.
Like “Sun Music,” the Australian
Ballet itself is sitting on the fence. The
speed at which this stiff-young company
continues to mature makes it imperative
that it decide to jump down on one
side or the other, or strike a firm and
appreciable balance between the per-
formance of primitively inspired mod-
ern dance and classical ballet, which,
this season, is on the downswing of
the seesaw. I realise everything can’t
be accomplished at once, but I fear
that in the heat of the moment of
decision the momentum of modern
dance might leave behind it a neglected
mass of stylised perfection, the essence
of traditional classical ballet.
The stories of the traditional classics
may be trite, but they have imagina-
tion. Looking beyond the quality of the
entertainment and technical skiff of the
dancers, which governs the interpreta-
tion of feeling, it is not impossible to
discover a philosophy, admittedly not
as up to date as that propounded in
modern ballets, but not completely
divorced from life. The young are not
so insular that they can’t appreciate
merit regardless of how it is presented.
So, apart from appealing to young
ballet lqvers by including modern works,
I think the Australian Ballet would be
wise to present a near-equal proportion
of classical ballet in its repertoire, pro-
vided this part of the repertoire has
variety. By doing this it will accom-
modate the conservatives as well as
maintaining and exhibiting the excel-
lence of the disciplinarian qualities of
classical ballet.
“Sun Music” is flamboyant, over-
whelming, invigorating, and always
dynamic. The haunting effect of Peter
Sculthorpe’s discordant score is all the
more telling when it vibrates through
the auditorium from amplifiers at the
back of the theatre. It is a compelling
force which, together with Kenneth
Rowell’s ingenious concentric lighting
and sets, draws the audience from the
eerie darkness of the theatre to the
focal point of sensual movement
activated by the sun. The vigor of the
dramatic modern dancing calls for
tremendous stamina in the artists. The
Soil dancers swathed in ochre
decorated with white and blue
Aboriginal tribal markings gyrate in
the hazy light of a rising sun which
camouflages the translucent turquoise
cyclorama. In “Mirage” Karl Welander
agilely executes a frenzied dance on
a desolate expanse under a white-hot
sun, alone but for a pack of weird
beasts figments of his imagination.
The ethereal quality of “Growth”
brings serenity to the turbulence.
Josephine Jason glides gracefully with
Kelvin Coe to jingling Balinese-
inspired music.
“Energy” is a feat of acrobatic-dance
skill. Eight of the Ballet’s very athletic-
looking male dancers in sporting cos-
tumes have as their only props two
enormous multi-colored bouncing rub-
ber balls. In the final movement, “Des-
truction,” the shattering power of the
sun reduces humanity to a grovelling
mass with no way out but death.
By contrast, I felt no ecstasy radiat-
ing from “Swan Lake” (Act II), which
opened this first program of the new
season. The technical skill of the corps
cle ballet was diligently displayed, but
the unevenly sized Cygnets disappointed
because their movements were not
precise enough. Kenneth Rowell’s
scenery and costumes for “Ballet
Imperial” have lost no color or splen-
dor since last season, nor has the Aus-
tralian Ballet’s mastery of Balanchine’s
elegant choreography, after the classical
style of Russian ballet, diminished.
ART/ELWYN LYNN
OUTDOOR BEAUTIES
Rupert Bunny Retrospective. City Art
Gallery, Newcastle.
DAVID THOMAS, director of New-
castle’s City Gallery, has compiled an
informative catalogue and has mounted
58 well-chosen works by Rupert Bunny,
who, he feels, is still neglected despite
the retrospective at Victoria’s National
of 94 works in 1946, and whose land-
scapes, he considers, too often over-
shadow his mural-like mythological
paintings.
Such was the switch in taste that
Bunny’s quietly lyrical landscapes from
the South of France, that were not
admired locally in the ’twenties and
’thirties amid the robust gums and
panoramas of good properties, so
aroused enthusiasm in the late ’thirties
and ’forties that Sydney’s Macquarie
Galleries gave Bunny eight shows be-
tween 1939 and 1946, six after his
death in 1947, and occasionally released
works in mixed exhibitions.
He was away from Australia a long
time; from 20 to 70 he had lived
abroad, having been honored by the


Old Salon. Maybe in 1933, when he
returned at 70, and after his French
wife’s death he courted obscurity, but
it did not last long, and his re-
emergence coincided with the rejection
of his so-called anti-modernisation. His
later work shows an admiration for
Matisse, his strictures of post-
impressionism had only been against
uncritical admiration for it, and, in
1938, he became vice-president of the
Contemporary Art Society.
Australianism dies hard, however, in
our art. The absence of Australian
content is the ■ reason why Bunny, as
David Thomas suggests, is neglected
in comparison with Roberts, Streeton,
and Conder; and Mr. Thomas’ selec-
tion stresses those dewy, soft, sun-
suffused landscapes and those ladies in
loose, flowing dresses dappled by the
cool sunlight that derive from a dis-
tributary of the international main-
stream of the 1890 s. Suggestions of
Boudin, Bonnard, Renoir, and Degas
fleet by.
In the few mythological works it
seems that Art Nouveau and the Nabis
influenced Bunny, and Art Nouveau is
hardly the style for rippling muscles of
a strong man and his dragon in Hercules
in the Garden of Hesperides. But myths
for Bunny were only exercises in decora-
tive figure compositions: his real myths
are elsewhere.
Just where is arguable, but what
isn’t is the sheer beauty of the outdoor
figure compositions and landscapes
where the myth is about moments of
eternal spring. Between about 1910 and
1920 (Bunny did not date his work),
amid (he informal grouping of people
whose garments are playfully and casu-
ally flecked with sunlight that looks
incandescent, may stand in the centre
or escape from the side in the manner
of Manet or Degas an unnoccupied
chair that takes on symbolic overtones.
The light of Under the Trees seems to
bring the generations together, like a
moment from “The Forsyte Saga”;
the youngest adult is lit with a deli-
cious, quivering pink light, the elders
sit upright in dark colors, and the trees
both shade and enclose the scene. Of
course, it’s as far from Munch as his
allegories are from ancient Greece, but
his undidactic landscapes are full of
whispered messages.
Yet, with all these suppositious influ-
ences, Bunny remains true to the slow,
drifting rhythms of Low Tide, Brig-
no gan of 1901 and to the light some-
where between Boudin and Bonnard.
Boudin could be cold and Bonnard
lush, but at his best, despite some
umbrageous landscapes and gnarled,
symbolic trees, Bunny catches the
transient air of spring; it’s a spring
that looks so ephemeral that it does
not presage autumnal fruitfulness, for
his best art is about fleeting, euphoric,
aesthetical, and psychological moments.
Hercules may engage the dragon,
Persephone be raped, but Bunny found
the true signs (“symbols” is too strong)
of life in southern France.
Communicating
RED, WHITE, AND ROSY
AUSTRALIAN commercial television,
12 years old this month, has just been
reviewed as an investment prospect by
the Melbourne stockbroking firm of
Roach, Williams and Co. After a 20-
page survey of the 41-station industry,
their summary verdict — “We are
confident that it offers excellent oppor-
tunities for profitable investment.”
Which is not the most surprising market
tip of the year. But the Roach, Wil-
liams confidence is not merely hung on
the industry’s healthy present (“On a
national basis, television revenues have
been increasing at an annual rate of
around 10 percent”). The significant
clue to television’s growth potential in
Australia is color. The survey report
states, “While full color is a long way
off, there is little doubt that by 1971
or 1972 Australian television viewers
can expect at least 50 percent of their
programs to be available in color.”
And then we’ll have fun. Talking
recently about the imminence of full
color TV in Britain, Press baron Lord
Thomson said: “I shudder to think
what this means, almost certainly the
changing of all our printing machines.”
PROLIFERATING POETRY
“IF YOU don’t like this magazine, or
any other magazine—make your own.”
This rather intimidating statement
comes as a postscript to the second issue
of “Our Glass,” a four-page “poetry and
creative fiction” periodical published
recently in Melbourne.
Its editor and publisher, Kris
Hemensley, of Carlton, is a young Eng-
lish poet who immigrated to Australia
a couple of years ago. Impressed by the
proliferation of small poetry magazines
and pamphlets in Europe, he hopes
that the publication of his magazine
here will encourage other writers in
similar ventures. Although publication
of “Our Glass” is irregular, depending
entirely on the availability of suitable
contributions, there have been two issues
within two months of each other and
another is expected late this month.
Hemensley crams his four foolscap
pages with as many poems as he can
and feels that what he sacrifices in
appearance is justified by the number
of new poets he has published. Also, by
keeping production costs down, he has
managed to recover his expenses on
both issues—an achievement that several
editors of larger and more pretentious
literary magazines might well envy.
COOKING WITH WORDS
THE American advertising man was
demonstrating some of the latest
examples of U.S. TV commercials to
“This Day Tonight’s” phlegmatic
l reporter Iain Finlay. The adman’s prize
exhibit was a film for an instant biscuit-
mix for women who, as the man said,
“don’t have the time to start their
biscuit-making from scratch, like
grandma used to do.” It all seemed to
bewilder reporter Finlay, whose unim-
pressed and humorless response obvi-
ously provoked the American into
thinking that he had a communication
hang-up on his hands, that the message
wasn’t getting through. He reached
back in his mind for a quick interpreta-
tion, but all he had there was jargon.
“You see,” he said, “this commercial
is aimed at the housewife not in a
scratch-type ingredient situation.” Ah,
TV is a great educator, talkwise.'
THE IMPROVING ZERO
MELBOURNE’S ATVO had it hard
from the beginning. First it was allo-
cated a channel which simply didn’t
exist, in that most receivers required
expensive conversion before they
could receive it. Then they had their
opening junket to live down — a TV
spectacular that haunts the channel as
surely as Ern Malley haunts Max
Harris. Next came the problem of
poor reception. Most homes had their
aerials positioned so as to get the best
picture from the two original com-
mercial channels, and, years later, tech-
nicians are still clambering over view-
ers’ roofs to exorcise “ghosts.”
Heavily promoted audience-partici-
pation stunts cost, the Ansett organi-
sation a lot of money but resulted
in no perceptible improvements in
ratings. Not even an astronomically
expensive policy of recent feature films
at peak-time six nights a week
made any lasting impression. The
station tried live shows to capture the
public imagination. The first was Ray
Taylor’s, which got a cult following
but nothing more. Then came a few
fiascos with Jimmy Hannan. Heads
rolled, new programs were tried, but
the first few years of operation passed,
with ATV attracting the same tiny
ratings as the ABC.
Last month, to the industry’s sur-
prise, ATV nosed out HSV to take
second place in the ratings race. It
captured 23.3 percent of the overall
audience to 21.8 percent for HSV,
which had been on a slow slide down
the ratings graph for 12 months. HSV
has since recovered its position (23.6
percent) at the expense of ABV (down
to 13.1 percent) and GTV is still far
ahead of the field with 41.7 percent
of the total audience. ATV is back
now to a 21.6 percent rating, but on
the strength of its momentarily im-
proved position the station has felt
encouraged to increase its advertising
rates twice in the past few months.

BECOMING FAMOUS
IN A VERY
ROUNDABOUT WAY
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Ravages. Violette Leduc. Aurthur
Barker. $4.20.
EVERY WORD of “La Batarde,” the
autobiography that thrust the obscure
author Violette Leduc into the fore-
front of best-sellers about three years
ago to the musical accompaniment
which she has openly acknowledged as
the sweetest in the world the clink-
ing of personal cash-registers filled
me with repugnance. Not all Simone
de Beauvoir’s sincere preface gushery,
Camus’ acceptance of her early works,
Genet’s recorded praise, or Sartre’s
initial encouragement could persuade
me that “La Batarde” was much more
than a fashionable piece of selfconscious
verbal onanism to which the reader
was invited in the role of paying
voyeur. At the time my own suspicion
was that probably due to lack of public
recognition, after more than 20 years of
published work, something had gone
sour. For, until her autobiography, Mile
Leduc had enjoyed some succes d’estime
for her three or four previous novels in
the very closed shop of French littera-
teurs, but found this cold comfort for
the small editions which remained
gathering dust on the shelves of Left
Bank bookshops.
Now the mystery is solved. One of
these earlier novels, “Ravages,” has
just been reprinted in France and is
available for the first time in an
English edition. And this is great
writing. At last one can concede even
the tag of female Genet. Turning back
to “La Batarde” one finds that indeed
almost all those printed compliments
above famous names were for her pre-
vious works, including this one. So that
is what they were talking about!
“Ravages”- is everything that “La
Batarde” was not. Yet it is exactly
the same story. The difference is in
the telling . . . and what a difference.
Here the bloom is still on the grape.
The words of love pour forth with the
rapture of a modern Song of Solomon.
The awakening of lesbian passion,
the discovery of bisexuality, and the
final abandonment in the self-made
desert of loneliness are identical in
both books, but in this earlier roman
de clef there is not a word too many,
no phrase is out of place, there is no
sense of stale regurgitation, of look-
how-clever-I-am posturing. The
reader is not essential to the work.
It is a novel written because it must be
written, not because it has to be read.
“La Batarde” seemed shouted hoarsely
from the rooftops and everyone
seemed commanded to look up and
listen. But Simone de Beauvoir’s
words aptly describe “Ravages”: “A
woman is descending into the most
secret part of herself and telling us
about all she finds there with an
unflinching sincerity, as though there
were no one listening.”
The opening seduction of Therese-
Violette by schoolgirl Isabelle is much
more frankly dealt with in this earlier
work, yet it is so poetically handled
that only a confirmed prude could
take offence. This also applies to the
affaire with a female schoolteacher, the
attempt at marriage with Marc, and
the abortion of their child. Yet the
mother-fixation and supposed mother-
betrayal which is at the root of all the
trouble is more delicately hinted at
here and is therefore somehow more
persuasive.
Unlike Violette, her altar ego,
Therese, even at her most revoltingly
possessive, never loses the reader’s
Leduc ... unflinching sincerity
sympathy. Her emotional cannibalism
which even causes her to wake her
sleeping partners and to prevent them
from going to their work, and kills
the very love it is trying to preserve,
is exorcised and purified in the earlier
novel Therese, knowing that she
will never find an intensity to match
her own, yet refusing to take one step
toward any compromise, ultimately
renounces all personal relationships to
go her way alone. She discovers that
she can be sufficient unto herself, that
she exists as an identity. Her real
fulfilment will come as a writer: “I
shall open my arms, I shall hug the
fruit trees in them and give them to my
sheet of paper.”
English readers can now enjoy the
real success of the later autobiography.
Because it was a best-seller, several of
the novels which ought to have made
Violette Leduc’s name years ago are
being reprinted. And about time, too.
BEWARE OF "ZOM-MAN"
By JOHN BAXTER
The Kretzmer Syndrome. Peter Way.
Herbert Jenkins. Approx. $4.00.
Qualtrough. Angus Hall. Herbert
Jenkins. $2.65.
MYTHS ARE a staple of literature in
all countries, nowhere more than in
Britain, where fiction can be charted as
a series of passages from archetype to
archetype. Having devalued the super-
human James Bond and grown tired of
his illusory mirror image, the workman-
like thug-spy of Deighton and Le
Carre, writers are currently in search
of new symbols. These two novels offer
possibilities, though neither one on
which I personally would place my
money.
In “Qualtrough,” Angus Hall, mind-
ful of the Moors Murderers and their
grubby antecedents, offers us an insane
wife-killer as some sort of hero for our
time. Adam Crosse batters his wife to
death with a fire screen, then blames
the crime on an imaginary man named
Qualtrough, whose persona he has lov-
ingly created with a complex web of
false addresses, forged letters, and
muffled phone calls. Predictably, the
police are neither fooled nor amused,
though it soon becomes a race between
impending arrest and Crosse’s mental
collapse. The finale, designed to be
bizarre, is actually of a banality com-
parable to that of the author’s style;
anybody who has read Robert Bloch’s
“Psycho” will have seen it all before,,
done much better.
Happily, “The Kretzmer Syndrome”'
is decidedly more intriguing. A brisk
and cryptic excursion into day-after-
tomorrow science fiction, it has England
paralysed by a series of electrical black-
outs, traced eventually to the influence
of a TV show called “Zom-Man.”
Everybody literally everybody
watches “Zom-Man,” and when it’s over
they get up, turn on the lights, make
a cup of tea . . . The resulting over-
load blows every switch in the country.
Adding up the evidence, sociologist Pro-
fessor Matthew Kretzmer tells his
employer, Prime Minister Francis
Player, that the English are losing their
individuality. Everybody now wants the
same as everybody else, and a program,
product, or person who gives it to them
has a total audience.
Kretzmer offers a solution. English-
men need to externalise their energies.
They need something to believe in, a
myth that will pull them out of self-
gratification and into a more ascetic
frame of mind, as Churchill did in the
war years. One is already growing up,
the myth of a man named Flanagan
who leads a sort of social-democrat
Salvation Army called simply “The
Movement.” Flanagan, an Australian
TV compere moved to England, heads
an organisation made up of influential
but not upper-class people—policemen,
factory foremen, plus millions of honest
English yeomen. Their uniform is the
blue boiler suit, their symbol the pic-


Way ...s omething to believe in?
ture of a simple middle-aged hard-
working bloke, and their motto “It’s
your turn now.” Effectively, they con-
trol the country. But is Flanagan a
force for good? And is Kretzmer’s
theory viable? One can only guess, and
the British Government guesses wrongly.
Into this complex situation Way in-
troduces self-seeking politicians anxious
to make political capital from the dis-
sent, a group of whole-wheat bread in-
tellectuals with names like Damon and
Madrigal,, a plot to assassinate the de-
crepit Queen Elizabeth 11, and some
diverting sub-dramas. Against a back-
ground of London slowly sinking into
a pink plastic porridge of interchange-
able flat units, formed plastic furniture,
and mass-produced entertainment, the
story toils on to its confusing but finally
memorable climax.

THIS PAPERBACK edition of Sylvia
Plath’s collection of poems entitled
“Ariel” has come out five years after
her suicide. During this interval she
has become a legend among readers
of contemporary poetry. So pervasive
has her presence been that it seems
only a couple of years since she died,
and it comes as a shock to realise how
long ago it was.
These poems, written in the last
few months of her life, are perhaps the
most abrasive and self-lacerating in the
English language. The violence of the
best of them is, however, matched by
a complete control and dazzling
mastery of language. They exist at a
fever pitch where hysteria is combined
with fine laconicism, pain and ecstasy
are interchangeable, and love and hate
become the same thing, as in the well-
known poem about her father,
“Daddy.”
If one can rely on the internal evi-
dence of the poems it seems likely that
had she survived her suicide attempt
there would not have been another,
yet. Sylvia Plath seemed to regard
death as a test, a periodic happening
to which she subjected herself at ten-
year intervals. She must have been
very hard to live with, both for her-
self and other people. Her husband,
Ted Hughes, perhaps the most well
known English poet of his generation,
was separated from her at the time
of her death.
Ultimately I feel reservations about
the completeness of her achievement
when compared with the very great,
such as Frost or Yeats. The destructive-
ness of her vision and the exhibitionism
implicit in her obsessive writing around
the subject of her own suicide leave
me feeling uneasy about how well her
poetry will last.
If Sylvia Plath is a poet who sought
ordered chaos, it might be said of Gwen
Harwood that she is a poet who is
seeking order in chaos. She expects to
find this order only briefly, however. So
she writes:
Wholeness is elsewhere. At this hour
I sense and fear the involving shape
of absence, and a night whose power
the gifts of grace alone escape.
Gwen Harwood has emerged as the
doyenne of the post-Hope wave of Aus-
tralian poets, although in terms of age,
as she was born in 1920, she is closer
to, say, Judith Wright than Wallace-
Crabbe, who is 14 years her junior yet
started publishing widely at about the
same time as she did.
Gwen Harwood has the strength of
a late starter. She is tremendously
impressive at a technical level, she has
complete intellectual assurance (but not
certainty), and in her poems she is able
to create her own poetic world. This is
an important ability which makes her
much more impressive between the
covers of a book than she is on the
page of a magazine, where a poem of
hers tends to look detached, hurried,
dashed off.
Her poetic world revolves around
recurring figures such as Professor
Eisenbart (I must say I preferred the
Eisenbart series of her first book to
the Krote series in her second book),
and also around her interest in music
and her personal relationships with
friends and family. Images of light
and darkness, water and wine recur
in her poems. Each time she uses these
images she is able to extract a new
variation, so that their effect is cumu-
lative. She is able to range from the
passionate to the satirical utterance.
This second collection of hers is also
enriched by a number of more directly
personal poems, which seems to be
the most significant new direction her
poetry is taking.
At times I am worried by what
seems like an excess of fluency and
detached brilliance. Her poems about
bluestockings and critics indicate per-
haps an overconsciousness of possible
critical reaction. So in “Suburban
Sonnet” she writes of a housewife that
“Once she played for Rubinstein, who
yawned.” The fact that Rubinstein
yawned is added quickly and defen-
sively. In a poem in her first book
she used a phrase “alizarin shame.”
Scarlet or crimson shame would have
been a cliche. Her ingenuity in avoid-
ing obvious phrases is one of the
pleasures of her work, but sometimes
this makes her poetry excessively
cerebral.
In some of her more personal poems,
such as the very graceful compliment
“To A. D. Hope,” her tone is less
assured, because her own feelings are
exposed to the reader more openly and
the mask has been dropped. This
openness, I feel, enhances the poem.
At her best, Gwen Harwood is an
original and gifted poet. Her height of
achievement is shown in these lines from
“New Music”:
Who can grasp for the first time
These notes hurled into empty space?
Unless, wakeful with questioning,
some mind beats on necessity,
and being unanswered learns to bear
emptiness like a wound that no
word but its own can mend; and finds
a new imperative to summon
a world out of unmeasured darkness
pierced by a brilliant nerve of sound.
R. A. Simpson is also one of the
post-Hope wave of Australian poets.
This is his third collection. He is less
assured, more plain-spoken than Gwen
Harwood. The line of alienation which
runs through her work strikes root much
more deeply in his poetry. So he writes:
I live with exhibits,
Rows and rows of question-marks
On which I cannot hang my coat.
As can be seen from this quotation
in Simpson’s poetry there is a genuine
experimentation with language and a
commendable grappling with the nature
of existence. In “A View Of Middle
Age” he even doubts his own agnos-
ticism, which may appear flaccid to his
children, when they grow up and com-
pare it “with blood and fire that riot
on a cross.” In “Boswell to Himself”
and “The Departure of Governor Mac-
quarie,” Simpson evokes images of
failure, memorable because of the
characters’ persistence and stoicism.
“A Suit For Everyman” is the second
collection of Eric Irvin’s poetry. He
belongs to the elder generation of Aus-
tralian poets, but was silent for some
years and this book marks a welcome
return to poetic activity. His poetry is
more traditional than that of the other
poets under review. At their best, his
poems have a quiet evocation, as in
“Summer Squall”:
Compressed by wind, the trees
Close up their rounded mass,
Unfold with every lull,
and then are balled again
in hands of giant strength.

New Guinea . . . Future Indefinite?
Edited by John Wilkes. Angus and
Robertson. $2.25.
A PRINTING of six papers read at the
34th summer school of the Australian
Institute of Political Science in Canberra
last January might easily strike you as a
book to pass over, but I found it
gripping, right through to page 155,
where I found someone described only
as Mrs. Legge uttering at least some of
my questions for me:
“It seems to me that at this school,
although we have had experts in plenty,
controversy has been practically absent.
Perhaps it is because the experts were
not in the correct fields we needed
more experts in New Guinea affairs and
also needed some experts in interna-
tional affairs. But ‘Future Indefinite’
has been treated by all as though the
future was definite, as though we have
another twenty or thirty years of stable
development and the problems are
merely how we spend our money and
how and when independence is granted.
What right have we to assume that we
have this sort of time? I do not think,
if you look around the map, that it is
there.
Mrs. Legge’s outburst might easily
have been triggered by the same force
which caused other explosions at this
time, when the school was almost
ended. She had been to the Institute’s
1958 talk-in. So had Paul Morawetz,
who had returned with years of prac-
tical experience in decolonialising
Africa, only to hear the same things
being said: whose concluding remarks
were, “You might care to think back
on what the British Government
learned at tremendous expense about
trying to make Ministers out of people
without giving them power ... if we
disregard all this what are we learning
from history? The lessons of Africa
are clear.”
And equally clear were the protests
of planter lan Downs and Albert
Maori Kiki, Pangu Pati secretary, at
the end of the school. Mr. Kiki said,
“We are like animals emerging from
the water and have to bow down and
lick your boots just because if we go
against you this money, this thing you
put on a golden plate, will be taken
away from us.”
He had some hard words for Aus-
tralian procedures: “I am a black
man from New Guinea and must have
a tag on my neck . . . Australia should
seek other people’s assistance to develop
New Guinea but the Australian Govern-
ment says ‘We know better and we
don’t want assistance from other
people’ (mentioning the Philippines,
Japan, and Malaysia specifically)”
. . . and “the Australian Government
does not like the services of other
people but services like American
Volunteer Service or New Zealanders
or other people could come and live
in Papua and New Guinea and develop
it under a volunteer service scheme.”
And Mr. Downs: “Australia is re-
jecting Papua and New Guinea. You
are rejecting closer association and
therefore eventually Papua and New
Guinea will have to choose other associ-
ates. I believe that the dogma of the
Australian immigration policy has a
great deal to do with this and one of
the last speakers affirmed this. This is
something political and as deeply
embedded in the policy of the Aus-
tralian Labor Party as in everybody
else, because it even expelled people
for questioning it. This, in the end, will
be the determining factor. East New
Guinea and West New Guinea will be
united and eventually they will all link
up with Indonesia.”
A very brief summary of a book-
length publication which includes both
the generality of Australians’ thoughts
about Papua-New Guinea, and the
numerous pointers to aspects of
Australia’s policy which deserve con-
tinuous public debate: the more so
because there is rarely any worthwhile
Parliamentary debate on them. As
taxpayers are providing an average
of more than $6 a year each for the
Territory, and could continue so for
many years, the price of this book and
the effort of glancing through it do
seem a good investment.

These are the words of Alexis Lichine (author,
Vine grower and exporter of International re-
pute) describing one of his favourite red wine
selections the young Beaujolais-Villages. As
with blooming country girls this wine is at its
best when young. Beaujolais-V illages (1966)
is a french red wine at its peak now, and is to
be drunk, not sipped. It is one of Alexis
Lichine’s wine selections for this year and
is made available in Australia by (( Liquor

The "Jewish Herald"
Reference to my involuntary involve-
ment in the fight between the Victorian
Jewish Board of Deputies and the
“Jewish Herald” (8., August 10) you
state that: . . he levelled criticism
against the actions of Jewish para-
troopers in the June war.” I am afraid
this is incorrect. As a former para-
trooper with some knowledge of war, I
can only express admiration for the
humane treatment of Arabs by all
Israeli soldiers in face of intense
provocation from aggressive and hostile
neighbors. In all history, I doubt
whether there was ever a finer example
of patient and moderate reaction to
threats of utter annihilation.
It is not correct, as the Victorian
Board of Deputies would have it, that
opposition to my column reached any
kind of crescendo in recent months. For
four years my column was under attack
from vocal minority groups within the
community; the peak was probably
reached in 1965-66 when I was criticis-
ing over-institutionalised religion, Zion-
ist Revisionism, exploitation of sex, etc.
When I turned to Israel this year, the
response from the readers was relatively
mild. In fact, the editor received only
two abusive letters, one of which was
published. Against this, I received
numerous messages of goodwill from
readers, including several congratula-
tory letters. The attack came not from
the readers but from the VJBD.

“What do we know
about Asia?"
“What do we know about Asia?”
(8., July 20) pays scant respect to the
contribution made by Monash Univer-
sity in this field. Monash has two dis-
tinct institutions devoted to the study of
South-East Asia. There is the Indones-
ian and Malay Languages Section of
the Department of Modem Languages.
It has about 200 undergraduates
enrolled this year. It was set up in 1962
under Professor Cyril Skinner, the
author of several highly regarded works
on Malay literature and history. It
now has a staff of eight, including Mr.
Idrus, one of Indonesia’s most distin-
guished novelists.
Monash also has its Centre of South-
East Asian Studies, a unique group in
the Australian university scene. It was
designed to build up a concentration of
South-East Asian specialists among both
staff and graduate students. The Centre
is a co-ordinating institution to link
activities in separate departments and
to provide a point of focus for special-
isation in this area.
So far this year, 17 graduate stu-
dents have enrolled for M.A. or Ph.D.

It . startled me that the teaching of
Chinese at Camberwell Grammar
School was not mentioned under the
heading of “School Language Studies.”
I would like to point out to you
and your readers that there are at
present 162 boys at our school who are
taking Chinese as a subject in the
normal school curriculum. This is the
third year in which we are presenting
candidates for the Matriculation
Chinese examination. Of those who
have matriculated in Chinese at Cam-
berwell Grammar, four boys have gone
on to study Chinese and Japanese at
the Oriental Studies Department of
the University of Melbourne.

Among all the pertinent writing I was
naturally disappointed to find a thump-
ing platitude (“Australians are remark-
ably good at Indonesian”) attributed
to me. What I told the interviewer was
that the junior secondary pupils I
teach read and speak Bahasa Indo-
nesian readily and unselfconsciously.
Because Bahasa Indonesian is a
relatively uncomplicated language with
regard to pronunciation, spelling, and
many aspects of grammar, it is possible
for a large percentage of junior
secondary pupils to “get into” the lan-
guage with a good deal of success.
This is not to say that Bahasa Indo-
nesian is an “easy” language. Its mas-
tery entails the grasping of many com-
plexities. But in the initial stages —even
following the traditional grammar-text
approach enough confidence can be
gained to enable pupils to tackle these
later complexities with success.

Greece's Colonels
Mr. Gullett, in his deep concern for
the welfare of the Greek people, “those
poor uneducated peasants” as he calls
them (8., July 27), has decided in his
own autocratic way, that “guided
democracy” (meaning “ruthless dic-
tatorship”) was the only way of life
for Greeks because what is good for
Ethiopia, Nigeria, the Africans, etc.,
must be good enough for the Greeks,
and perhaps for many other nations
which, in Mr. Gullett’s book, fall
under the same category.
This is why Mr. Gullett feels that
as far as Greece is concerned, “beat-
ings-up, imprisonments, and tortures”
must be accepted as “caresses and
paternal affection” such as the one
displayed by the despots of Greece at
the moment. Mr. Gullett finally praises
the Greek Dictators for their efficiency
in marketing primary produce and
regulating public utilities.
Despite the economic and political
chaos which, according to Mr. Gullett,
prevailed in Greece from July, 1965,
to April, 1967, (Mr. Gullett purposely
ignored the past) he forgot to mention
in his article that under the Greek-
style “decadent” democracy he so much
dislikes, the Greek nation had enjoyed
freedom, and material benefits. For
example, they raised their per capita
income from $lBO in 1948, to $509
in 1966, and despite the shortcomings
of the so-called “establishment,” the
Greek economy and gross national
product grew by an average of 8.2 per-
cent during the years from 1956 to
1966. This growth was faster than any
other European country and faster than
the yearly growth of the U.S.A. and
U.S.S.R.
Mr. Gullett also forgot to mention
whether the Military Junta, after 18
months in power, are claiming to repre-
sent any portion or section of the Greek
population, and whether he agrees with
his mates, the Greek Colonels, that elec-
tions must not be held in Greece for
many years to come, because elections
are the prerogative of the “Western-
type” democracies.
Finally, Mr. Gullett’s sources of in-
formation made him make another his-
torical mistake, when he stated that
Venizelos and Karamanlis were “good
dictators” of Greece. If he refers to
his library, he will find that Mr. E.
Venizelos was a true democrat and
Mr. Karamanlis a political leader and
Prime Minister who had the guts to
stand for re-election, was outvoted, and
then decided to live abroad.
To the great majority of Greeks
living inside and outside Greece, the
“Colonels revolution” is utterly revolt-
ing, immoral, and unacceptable. The
hatred of the Greek citizens, those true
patriots and democrats who are strug-
gling for democracy for over half a
century, can be seen in their eyes even
if their lips are sealed. Surely Mr.
Gullett must have spoken to some of
them . . . besides his frequent visits to
the lobbies of Mr. G. Papadopoulos?
To an ordinary Greek citizen, the
word “democracy” has only one mean-
ing, and this is why the Greeks demand
the opportunity to elect a free and
progressive Government, to be elected
by the people, for the people of Greece.
Mr. Gullett’s “guided democracy” is
nothing but hypocrisy, unless, of course,
by guided democracy he means “the
continuation of foreign interference in
the affairs of the Greek nation.”

SOMETHING NEW WITH
Graham Kerr
FIE IN THE
SKY WHILE
YOU FLY
A JET can take off from London at
breakfast-time, arrive in Montreal at
breakfast-time and at San Francisco
at breakfast-time. The new breed of
gastronome needs some Space Age
adjustment and become, perhaps, a
gastronaut? After 50,000 miles of inter-
national jetting in the past 12 months
I decided to scrutinise my in-flight
meals: how much I eat and what it is
likely to do to me both now and in
the eternal breakfast-time.
Armed with stopwatch, knife, fork,
spoon, and champagne glass, I pro-
ceeded to note my performance.
7.30 p.m. out of Sydney, for
some reason known only to the Civil
Aviation Department gentlemen, there
is a solemn orange juice or temperance.
Eight minutes and 30 seconds out, and
it’s another story. There’s the welcome
clink of the mobile bar and a beaming
flight steward plies his wares like an
Arab merchant.
8.30 p.m. Dinner is served. A dozen
plump Sydney Rock Oysters on
the shell four-year-olds at least.
“Champagne with your oysters?”
inquires the steward with the bottle.
“Certainly.”
“French or Australian?”
A quick, furtive look round.
“French.”
I manage to resist the Kangaroo
Tail Soup and make tentative moves
toward selecting the Chicken Con-
somme (real chicken) until the sherry
is about to be poured into the bowl.
“Ah one moment.”
“Sir?”
“I’ve changed my mind. Perhaps,
just the sherry?”
Left with the awful dilemma I
vacillated between the roast breast of
duckling and roast loin of lamb and
chilled rock lobster (a democratic
crayfish).
The duckling won feet down, but
largely because of Penfolds Shiraz
Matara Bin 20, described in their menu
as “lovely bouquet, soft full flavor, and
crisp, elegant finish,” I detected the
light hand of The Bulletin’s Cellar-
master in that description.
Cheese seems to be a fetish with
jet-set meal-planners. “It’s hardly
done,” they told me, “to carry Moe or
Kamaruka all the way to London.”
“We pick up Black Diamond in New
York, Stilton in London” . . . Fair
enough I suppose cheese is certainly
best when eaten where it’s made.
Fresh fruit, grapes, grannies, and that
beautiful hairy Chinese Gooseberry, so
hideously called Kiwi Fruit. Irish
whisky, liqueurs, hot coffee, and mint
slices.
10.30 p.m. The tray is removed, the
lights dim, and slumber settles in on
a groaning satisfaction.
11.30 p.m. Land at Nandi, Fiji. Hot,
humid, walk about and suffer pangs of
conscience about the statement, yet un-
spoken: “Yes, I was in Fiji last year
55
12.30 p.m. Take off to the tune of
an orange juice and iced towel. Slum-
ber; the Pacific slips by unnoticed.
3.45 a.m. “Wake up, you gluttons,
it’s eternal breakfast time.” At 3.45
a.m.!
“Well, that’s your tummy time, for
the locals it’s 7 a.m. (or thereabouts).
Grapefruit, champagne, chipolata
sausage, boiled eggs, champagne, mush-
rooms, tomatoes, champagne, rolls, but-
ter, coffee, champagne.
5.20 a.m. Land at Honolulu, so it’s
early breakfast. Walk about again.
7 a.m. Take off for San Francisco.
8.30 a.m. Luncheon. But, of course,
why not? After all, the Hawaiians are
peckish. Asparagus Soup, Jumbo
Shrimp (prawn to you), and, just what
I need, a New York cut Broiled Sirloin
with (yum!) a huge baked Idaho
Potato. Cheese (still Australian) and,
surprise! pineapple. More coffee,
more wine, and more mints.
11 a.m. Arrive San Francisco. Just
in time to hit the sack at the thought-
fully provided local motel. But, no, the
pangs of hunger drive me to believe it
really is 7 p.m. Time for dinner at
Ernie’s. Unwise, but, then, back home
it is dark.
5 p.m. Off we go again, this time to
New York. Local time is roughly mid-
night time for the locals to have a
champagne supper, excellent after a
decent dinner, which was really lunch.
So . . . well . . . champagne for after-
noon tea?
7 p.m. Champagne supper caviar
again, open-faced sandwiches and lob-
ster Creole. Another meal, that’s what
it is!
10 p.m. New York. Walk about.
11 p.m. Take off for London.
Midnight. What a simply splendid
time for morning refreshments. Let me
see apple strudel, bridge rolls, and,
good heavens! Oh, well, a cup of tea.
1 a.m. “Luncheon, lucky, lucky you.
Here it is, our lovely luncheon pre-
pared under the loving hand of Bill
Krafchuck from Air la Carte.” Caviar
. . . AGAIN! Smoked Sturgeon. New
England Clam Chowder (champagne),
Grilled Boneless Brook Trout (more
champagne), Roast Quail garnished
with grapes (burgundy), a little fresh
Alaskan Crab (champagne), and . . .
I’d had it, finally, irrevocably, had it.
I stopped mid-forkful like a Sydney
motorist in the petrol strike.
8 a.m. We landed at London.
“Breakfast time,” my stomach yelled.
“Where are you dining now?”
inquired a tactless porter.
“Dinner?” I choked back my
tears. “What I want is cornflakes
au naturel.”

Mildara Supreme Sherry is an outstanding example of the art of
the winemaker. A great sherry in the Mildara tradition of quality.
Here is a true, pale, delicate dry Sherry of Fino style. Mildara
Supreme Dry has been called the “Man’s sherry.” No other sherry
can quite match its smooth, subtlety, its distinctive taste and
bouquet. In one word —Supreme.
Mildara Chestnut Teal is a Sherry in the true Oloroso style, dark
golden in colour with a luscious mellow style of sweetness usually
preferred by women. This Sherry is an ideal appetiser for those who
prefer a sweeter style of wine.
