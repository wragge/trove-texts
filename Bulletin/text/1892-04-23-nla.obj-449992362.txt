This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive

If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, there.ore

conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to

DE. KELLY MAY BE CONSULTED FREE OFCOST ,BY SUFFERERS FROM
j . PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN COMPLAINTS.
' DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER.
ARE UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OF HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARB
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.
IP YOU ARE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER YOU REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.
ASK YOURSELF THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:—
AM I SUBJECT TO PALPITATION OF THE HEART, FLUSHES OF
HEAT, DRYNESS OF THE SKIN, PALE, SALLOW COMPLEXION,
RESTLESSNESS AT NIGHT, A DESPAIR OF RECOVERY, ANXIETY
WITHOUT CAUSE, FEAR OF DEATH, TENDENCY TO SUICIDE, LACK

L'lobe arise, more or less directly, from the
uneven distribution of wealth. The world
has enough, and just about enough, to
keep all its inhabitants in reasonable com-
fort, but there is practically nothing left
over for the luxury of any one favoured
class. Therefore the peasant who sleeps
along with the pig is the inevitable concomi-
tant of the rich monopolist ; and the foul,
dank, loathsome tenement house, with its
broken windows and murky stairways and
malodorous back-yard, is the necessary
adjunct of the palace ; and because the here-
ditary land-holder’s mansion is situated
among green bowers and foliage, the
labourer’s dwelling is built on rocks and
located upon an ash-heap, and will remain
there—unless social conditions are entirely
changed until the latter end of history.
There is no prospect of a period ever arriving
when this law of averages will be altered?
The record of every nation that has died
in the past is the story of a state that
perished because the handful of the
rich were too few to defend it, and
the great mass of the poor were too
unutterably wretched to care whether it
peiished or not. In the latter days of
old Assyria it is estimated that some two
per cent, of the sons of Ashuii owned the
whole wealth of the empire ; therefore the
other 98 per cent, stood by in dull indiffer-
ence when the Scythian avalanche rolled
down on the land, and Assyria vanished from
among the nations. In old Persia wealth
concentrated until some 400 or 500 gorgeous
nobles monopolised the entire kingdom? and
when Persia’s Nemesis came Darios Codo-
manus went out to defend his country with
300,000 slaves, pimps, and eunuchs in
armour, and they suffered themselves to be
killed like sheep because they had nothing
to live for. Poland, that land of so much
wasted sympathy and misspent pathos, went
under because 90 per cent, of the Polish race
were hungry slaves who cared nothing who
owned them so long as they had peace?md a
hovel and a loaf of black bread. The Free-
dom that shrieked when Kosciusko fell
was only the freedom of the Polish magnate
to starve, torture, and murder an utterly
wretched people, and the boasted Kosciusko
himself was merely a defied slave-driver who
lias been placed upon a pedestal of fame by a
maudlin generation.

Great estates ruined Italy ” is a saying
that has become historical. When Alauic
came, about one per cent, of the Romans
weie incapable of self-defence because
they were obese and bloated with rich
banquets and all manner of gorgeous-
ness, and the rest were equally in-
capable because they were hungry, servile,
and utterly degraded by the constant
stiuggle to stave off immediate famine.
Great estates, in like manner, ruined
Carthage, Egypt, old monarchical France,
and innumerable other empires. The natural
tendency of wealth is to become accumulated
in the hands of a few. By the vicious
principles of usury and land monopoly a
large fortune always tends to grow larger ;
and the still more vicious principle of pri-
mogeniture— that system which was invented
by the dead misers of the past in order to
piotect their hoards after they were dust
helps to prevent the great accumulations
fiom dissolving again into the common stock
when the original money-grabber has
departed, and his bones have been laid
beneath a lying inscription and tons of
marble, in the certain fear of a horrible
awakening. Therefore, the time comes for
one nation after another, when the rich are
too few and too flabby to defend their
country, and the great mass of the poor
cease to regard the country as worth defend-
ing. No one ever fought with any
enthusiasm to defend a fireless tenement
house and a leaky roof, and a bed of straw
and a soup-kitchen. Chronic hunger is the
grave of patriotism.
# # #
Great estates and great fortunes are the
grave that yawns for the Anglo-Saxon, for
the Teuton, the Iberian—in short, for
civilisation in general. England has
already one foot in that sepulchre.
America was saved so long as the
land lasted, but now that the fertile soil is
nearly all parcelled out the Republic is
visibly moving towards destruction. Aus-
tialia is comparatively secure also so long as
her laud lasts, but no longer. The general
diffusion of wealth—the destruction of the
great monopolies of land and money—is the
question of the hour ; if it cannot be settled,
then a time is coming when the great bulk
°. f A he Aryan races will find that their
civilisation is not worth fighting for, and if
the Mongol or the Tartar rolls down once
more upon Europe they will simply look on
with the dull contentment of utter misery
and let him roll, feeling that the mandarin
may be better than the landlord, and cannot
possibly be worse. There is no lack of
theoretical remedies, but so far none of them
have taken definite shape. Land Nationali-
sation is the favourite theory of the moment,
but already its apostles are beginning to lose
faith. If the State becomes the sole land-
lord and awards compensation to the dis-
possessed proprietors, then for many years
to come the nation will only pay in interest
what it now pays in rent, and the mono-
polist in land will become instead a mono-
polist in Government securities, and the
actual diffusion of wealth will be too slow a
process to confer much benefit upon either
this or the next generation. If the State
confiscates the land without compen-
sation, then it must reckon upon civil
war, or, at the very least, grievous and
bitter social discontent, for in Australia,
at all events, the land owning class is still
too numerous to be trodden upon with im-
punity. Land Nationalisation in some form
is inevitable, but it is still afar off, and the
country wants to discover some process
which is capable of immediate application.
Moreover, Land Nationalisation is only
one-fourth of a reform at the best. It may
abolish the monopoly of the soil, buc it leaves
the great money monopoly untouched. The
mere earth may become the common posses-
sion of the nation, but everything else—
houses, warehouses, gold, silver" ships, cattle,
sheep, stock and crop mortgages, Govern-
ment securities, and every other form of
wealth —will still keep accumulating in huge
fortunes as of old. The scheme, on which
so many hopes are fixed, leaves the sweater,
the usurer, the stock-jobber, and such finan-
cial despots as the Gui lds and Rothschilds
still intact ; it does not even abolish the land-
lord, cr, rather, it only abolishes the less
injurious half of him, and leaves the worse
half of him untouched. The man who owns
the rack-rented city tenements will be as
prosperous and as offensive as ever. The
only difference will be that he will lease the
ground on which his tenements stand from
the State, in place of buying it outright as
heretofore, but the oppressed tenant will get
there just the same.
* # »
Socialism of the type which Bellamy de-
picted is at least a logical remedy, but even
Bellamy left his creed unfinished, for he
altogether failed to explain how the new
order of things was to be brought about.
Neither has any other Socialist ever yet
simplied the deficiency. Ihe result to be
arrived at is clear and definite, but among
all the host of reformers, no one knows where
to begin. And while the world is waiting,
the great estates—those great estates which
ruined Assyria and Persia, Rome and Car-
tilage, Poland, and mediaeval France, and
which are now ruining almost the whole
civilised world—keep on accumulating. The
great necessity of the age is some measure
which will start the process of diffusion
without delay, so that the world will get,
no worse while it is waiting for some scheme
whereby it is to be made altogether better.
And the shortest road to this purpose seems
to lie in the establishment of the principle—
that the property of every deceased citizen
shall be equally divided among all his
descendants, any will or bequest to the
contrary notwithstanding ; in other words,
that, for the good Of the nation at large,
the principle of freedom of contract, already,
to a great extent, abolished among the
living, should be also abolished among the
dead.
* # *
Inadequate as it may seem, there is no
available process under the sun which pro-
vides so effectively for the equal diffusion of
wealth as this. Even upon the assumption
that there is no natural increase whatsoever
in the population—that when the two heads
of a household die they leave two children',
no more and no less, to take their places—
and that every legatee passes on his share
intact to the next generation, the breaking
up of the big estates would go on with
amazing rapidity. If ten millionaires die in
the present generation, their fortunes, in
much less than 500 years, w'ould be diffused
among over five million descendants—in
other words, they would be so completely
divided and subdivided that practically
every individual in the nation would have
inherited a part of the original property.
The process of making large fortunes and
accumulating large estates would go on, but
the process 0 f division and sub-division
would proceed much more rapidly. The
great monopolies would melt away faster
than a snowball in Tophet. The prospect
of gathering and hoarding wealth would still
exist as an incentive to enterprise ; tiro
country would eventually reap the advan-
tages of the enterprise, and the accumula-
tions would dissolve like a bubble upon the
death of their original owners, and presently
be scattered among the nation at large. In
France this system was established—so far
as land is concerned—a century ago, and
already the race of landlords has practically
vanished, and the country is subdivided
among as many millions of peasant pro-
prietors as can extract a reasonable livelihood
from its surface. If the same law wore
applied to all kinds of wealth every monopolv
must disappear in like manner. Any man
who possesses sufficient energy, or ability,
or clever dishonesty, might still gather up a
fortune, and live idly on the interest thereof,
but neither he nor a hundred of his kind
could establish a class of loafers and parasites
such as the hereditary nubility of Britain ;
in a very few generations the fortune would
become so attenuated through sub-division
that his successors must take their places in
the great army of industry once more.
* * *
The purpose of such a law could, no doubt,
be defeated where a father chose, for the
purpose of keeping his treasured pile
together, to make it over during his lifetime
to one favoured descendant, but this risk is
practically nil. The success of the French
system of inheritance sufficiently demon-
strates that fathers of that description are
too rare to make any perceptible difference
in the results. Moreover, this variety of
parent has seldom much either to give away
or to leave at death. The architect of a
colossal fortune is the man of boundless
tenacity the individual who hangs on to his
wealth even on his death-bed and would
hang on to it in his tomb as well if he only
knew how. The Mortiboy of Walter
Be,sant— the ancient money-grubber who
made over his wealth to his son in order to
save probate-duty, and was paralysed the
same night by the shock of being bounced
out of his entire fortune, and who spent the
balance of his life as a speechless cripple in
a wheel-chair without even the power to
audibly curse his thankless offspring—is a
mere creation of fancy. And if such°an in-
dividual did exist his fate would assuredly
be that of Besant’s hero, and he
would serve so effectually as a warn-
ing to his kind that the race would
there and then become extinct. There is
not, so far as we are aware, a single point on
which the scheme which we have outlined
could possibly break down. It is not ad-
vanced as pure and unadulterated Socialism ;
it is not an adequate recognition of the great
truth that the land should belong exclusively
to the people ; it is not by any means abso-
lute justice, for justice starts on the funda-
mental axiom that, all men are born free and
equal. But still it would, in a comparatively
short space of time, abolish nine-tenths of
the poverty and suffering by which the world
is troubled, and it possesses one inestimable
merit—it is immediately available. It is
very near, while Socialism, unhappily, is
very far oft, and it is a measure which could
be put in shape by even the dullest of politi-
cians, whereas even the most rudimentary
scheme of Socialism could only be established
by a heaven-born genius, and, for the time
at all events, no such genius is on hand.

A Plea for Manslaughter.
In its issue of last Saturday, Sydney Daily
Telegraph publishes a leading article in de-
fence of promiscuous shooting,, and with a view
to promote the practice of firing off guns at
strangers throughout Australia. In the course
of its remarks it glanced at the case of Mr.
Deacon, who lately shot his wife’s paramour at
Marseilles, and distinctly commended him for
so doing, regardless of the fact that the lady
was also guilty, and if one party to the tran«
action required shooting the other did also ' ri

And further, it exploded into maudlin rapture

T | l i s l i f^i‘ lir example of that dirty saintliness
übich leads the Anglo-Saxon race to get up on
its moral ear every now and then, and scream
tor blood. In the present case the individual
shot at was “ on the premises” at a late hour
but the “ premises ” were a paddock, whereas
the I elegraph goes out of its way to create an
impression that he was a brutal housebreaker
who was bursting into a lone woman’s residence
muter terrifying circumstances. The victim
was apparently only the girl’s sweetheart in
the ordinary acceptation of the term, for’ so
Lir as the evidence up to date goes, there is
nothing to show that ho did not intend to marry
her in the old, commonplace way. If the fact
that he desired to do so is any reason why he
should be cursed in the front column of a penny
paper, then marriage is indeed a failure. They
met surreptitiously at strange hours, somewhat
after the fashion of Juliet and that loath-
some housebreaker, Romeo, because the old lady
objected to the match, and they had certain
signals which they used at these meetings, after
the manner from time immemorial of man and
Jus best girl. The mother, on the night in
sallied out with a gun, decoyed her
daughter’s lover within reach by means of a
signal and loaded the man up with duckshot
when he came near enough to he a handy target
ihe I elegraph’s contention, therefore, prac-
tically amounts to_ this—that if a girl wishes to
marry a certain individual, and her mother,
from greed or cantankerousness or any other
cause, good or had, wants her to marry someone
else, or to remain single, it is a noble thing for
the old woman to blow the head off the objec-
tionable suitor, and other old women should be
encouraged to do likewise. Even if the case
should prove to he one of seduction, as the
Telegraph so cheerfully and gratuitously
assumes, the contention is utterly outrageous.
V\ oman for whom one morning contem-
porary demands the Parliamentary franchise
is presumed by law and common sense to be
a reasoning creature who is responsible for
hei own actions, and when an offence is
committed in which two persons are equally
concerned, it is absurd to shoot one of them
and u eep over the other. Moreover, when the
IX I. s ideas are adopted, any woman can go
out and shoot promiscuously at any man whom
she dislikes, or to whom she owes money, or
who knows of any crime she has committed
and is liable to act as a witness against her,
and when he is dead and conveniently out of
the way she can get clear by the unsupported
statement that she believed him to haye designs
upon her or some member of her family. A
system by which any person is allowed to kill
another and furnish explanations afterwards, is
an exceedingly unsafe thing. Even the Tele-
graph s editor won’t live long under such a
regime; some actress who has got a “had notice”
in his paper, or some female who owes
him money, would simply blow his alleged
brains out, in a lonesome spot, and
explain later on that he looked with a dis-
honourable expression in his eye upon her
daughter—whom he probably never saw, and
who, as likely as not, was only a strange
orphan borrowed for the occasion. ‘ If the D.T.
regards sudden death as the fit penalty for
unlawful amours, why doesn’t it exhibit the
courage of its opinions, and demand that seduc-
tion shall he made a capital offence ? So long
as the country has got a hangman, it is a mean
and cowardly thing to expose an old woman in
quest of justice to the damp night air.
Shareholders’ Liabilities.
At last week’s meeting of a “ special report ’’
committee, or something, of a gone-bung Mel-
bourne hank, it was announced that a call upon
the London shareholders had met with a
“ splendid response,” whilst a call upon the
local shareholders had elicited a response far
less splendid. The ponderous British capitalist
seems to have taken his indebtedness for
granted. He held a certain number of partially-
paid-up shares in a hank which had suspended
business for lack of money in the till,
and his old-fashioned idea of the situation
was that the balance due for call on
each share would have to he provided,
even if it were necessary to pawn
one’s hoots in the struggle. His co-share-
holder in Melbourne is above these ancient pre-
judices. In Melbourne a “ bank ” can put the
shutters up and tell depositors to wait ten years
for an improbable chance of getting paid in full,
all the while that a huge total of uncalled
capital is left to mock their misfortunes on the
books of the company. Many of the share-
holders, no doubt, are hopelessly “ cronk” and
incapable of meeting a weekly call from the
milkman. The rest meet together and discuss
every kind of suitable liquidation scheme
except the scheme of forking out their shares in
that uncalled capital which has figured as a
guarantee of safety to depositors—on paper.
Depositors sigh and say nothing. They are
hopelessly invertebrate. Then the chief share-
holders, the men who, strictly speaking, are the
biggest debtors to the concern, vote themselves
£lOOO a year salary for “liquidating” the
bubble they have blown.

J 1 last meeting, that the missionary as de-

1118 )iua i result of 19 centuries of smug Chns-

4 ilt as could be expected. The reasons put
py the Board are short and to the point.

money, and otherwise conducts or misconducts
himself like a reverend clown of the Middle

reasonably be expected, the people who didn t

A Confidence Trick.
The Sydney Imperial Land, Building and
Deposit Company, managed by the lamented
Smairl, the yachting potentate, now com-
fortably in gaol, has just presented its little
epitaph to its creditors. It is very short and
very definite ; there is not a solitary cent fox
anybody. The capital has vanished, the deposits
have fled, the debenture-money has mysteriously
dissolved, and every possible or impossible
security has been mortgaged three deep, and
the cash thus raised has unaccountably flickered
out. The society (which had exactly 19s. in
the safe when it suspended) has put everything
up the spout, and everything is gone in one
amazing vanishment. The alleged shareholdeis
are mostly dead, or burst, or fled from the
wrath to come. The institution is as hollow as
a blown egg-shell, an absolute and utter void,
with no basis except a brass plate and a lie,
and there are only faint hopes of scraping
together enough to pay the liquidator. ? And
now the usual individual, signing himself A
Victim,” writes to the press to ask eleven ques-
tions, of which the following are a, fair sample
2. Why was the money of poor people taken on deposit
when there was no prospect of ever paying it hack .
3. Why was interest offered at the rate of 7 and 7j per
'cent, for the use of their money ? ,
4. Why was money' received on deposit when there was
an order from the court in the month of June, 1891, that
mo money was to he paid out? ,
5. Why was money taken on deposit from Septembei,
1890, when the society was not abie to pay the amount of
matured deposits when demanded?
(i. Why were the funds of the company used to pay a
gentleman the half of his deposit in case he would with-
draw his petition against them for the winding up ot the
company ? The petition was filed in June, 1891, and was
to be heard in Equity on July 22.
7. Why, in the meantime—that is, between June, 1891,
and July 22 -was a poor man deceived with regard to the
company’s position by taking a deposit of £2OO from him .
Ami a good deal more to the same effect.
Which, after all, is very like the subject of the
confidence-trick writing to the press to demand
why the complete stranger, whom he allowed to
go round the corner with his purse, never came
back, and hasn’t been seen since. A much more
pertinent question is one which this “ Victim
has altogether forgotten. Why hasn’t anything
happened to the directors of the society, seeing
that their penniless institution not long since
issued a balance-sheet, setting forth that it
owned £lOO,OOO or thereabouts and was
£lB,OOO to the good ; and what do the autho-
rities think of the auditors who guaranteed that
amazing document ?

A New Barrier.
The new immigration law which comes into
force this month in the United States is another
sign that the deluge is coming very near. By
this law the gates of the Republic are definitely
closed against “ all idiots, insane persons, or
persons likely to become a public charge, per-
sons suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous
contagious disease, persons who have been con-
victed of a felony or other infamous crime or
misdemeanour involving moral turpitude, poly-
gamists, and also any person whose ticket or
passage has been paid for with the money of
another, or who is assisted by others to come, un-
less it be satisfactorily shown on special enquiry
that such person does not belong to one of the
foregoing excluded classes.” There is also an
Act in force absolutely prohibiting Chinese
immigration under any circumstances whatso-
ever, and another which forbids the entry of
any person who lias been hired abroad to do
any work in the United States. These three
laws cover, among them, almost the whole immi-
gration problem. The last enactment, how-
ever, goes further than all the rest, for it
enables the authorities to throw upon the im-
migrant the onus of proving that he does not
belong to any one of the many prohibited orders,
and as no one can demonstrate with absolute
legal certainty that he is free from all the
innumerable disabilities, it enables the United
States Government, whenever it feels so
inclined, to shut its doors against the
whole human race in one act. When it sets the
example it is only a matter of time till the
whole American continent follows suit, and
after that Europe, and particularly England,
must go to smash. Ever since that universal
life-insurance system, the mediaeval guilds, was
broken up, England has had only two remedies
for poverty —either to hang the pauper or to
export him. Before emigration got fairly
started the man or woman who was out of
work and had no visible means of support, was
hanged—that is to say he or she was generally
flosiged for the first two offences and hanged for
the third. Something like 17,000 people were
thus disposed of in one reign alone. Then
the great idea arose of sending the poor to be
out of the road in America, or Australia, or
South Africa, and for a while England got
through by exporting someef them and hanging
the rest. After a while it stopped hanging
them, and trusted to exportation alone, and
when it couldn’t export them fast enough it
sent as many of the balance to gaol as the gaols
would hold, and lot the rest starve. In the
thirty years between 1850 and 1880 Britain
shunted 5| millions of starving wretches across
the seas, and about four millions were accumu-
lated in the country, making some nine millions
in all, as the results of 30 years of prosperity
and high-class civilisation. And now that
emigration is about stopped, England
must soon start strangling the poor
once more, or else there will be a cata-
clysm. When a sufficient proportion of the
population of any country is utterly desperate
through famine, then a hideous revolution be-
comes inevitable. The idea of finding a remedy
for poverty within the country itself never even
dawns upon the slow, conservative, bull-headed
Briton of the richer classes. He oscillates be-
tween the two ideas of execution and exporta-
tion. He won’t hang the poor if he can export
them, but if he can’t export them then he must
hang them —or else they will rise some day and
hang him, and thereby seriously disarrange the
fit of his collar and do an indelible injury to the
British Constitution.

The National Association of New
South Wales.
The New South Wales “National” Association
has devised a new method of performing its
duties as a joint-stock spy and informer in the
interests of Monopoly. Its great object, like
that of its twin association in Victoria, and its
unclean relative, the Patriotic League, of
Queensland, apart from enabling bricks-and-
mortar to usurp the rights of human flesh and
blood and intellect, is to strike the names of
democratic voters off the roll by any means,
fair or foul; and, in pursuance of this mission,
it keeps a special watch on the inhabitants of
boarding-houses, lodging-houses, and cheap
hotels, as being a nomadic crowd whose votes
can be cancelled with comparative impunity.
When the last West Sydney electoral list was
made up, one establishment of this kind re-
turned 44 voters, all of whom were fully
qualified by residence. The roll was ex-
hibited in the usual com’se, and a few days
later there arrived a batch of 44 letters, each
enclosing a circular setting forth the merits of a
certain remedy when applied to various more or
less loathsome complaints, and on the outside
of each envelope it was announced that the
document, if not claimed, was to be returned to
a certain box—used by the Association —at the
Post-office. The object of that organisation, in
thus turning itself into a pedlar of patent
nostrums, was obviously to get upon the track
of any individual who might be temporarily
absent, and get his name struck off the roll
before he got back. As it chanced, however,
no letters were returned, so a few days later a
personage called round with a book in lus
hand, and professed a desire to take the
names of all residents for insertion in
the Post-office directory. The boss of the
establishment, knowing that the directory takes
little account of the denizens of a lodging-house,
expressed his suspicions that the visitor was an
informer in the pay of the National Association,
but the latter swore so fluently, after the manner
of the deceased Ananias, that he represented an
official publication, that the information was
supplied. On this occasion five of the forty-
four voters were not actually on the premises ;
one had removed to the next street, and the
other four were absent in various directions. A
day or two afterwards letters arrived from the
secretary of the “ National ” Association noti-
fying each of the five that an objection had been
lodged against his name, and unless he appeared
within a very short period to prove his claims,
it would be struck off the roll. On each
envelope appeared the notification that the
document was to be returned, if unclaimed,
to the same old box mentioned on the
outside of the patent slush circulars, and from
this coincidence two things become distinctly
apparent. One of these is that the Association
acts as an agency lor boosting patent medicines
and disseminating circulars about loathsome
diseases; the other is that it sends round
agents to collect information by lying and the
meanest kind of false pretences, and that the
facts furnished to the bogus compiler of the
directory go direct to the office of the Associa-
tion Further it proves once more, and for the
thousandth time, that the Association is utterly
unprincipled in all its methods. ihe work-
man who is struck off the roll during
his temporary absence is as fully qualified
as the 1 Union Club squatter who goes
to Melbourne to attend the Cup meeting,
and who retains his vote unquestioned whether
absent or not, and who receives no patent-
medicine circulars from the sweaters organisa-
tion, neither does anyone call upon him with a
view to inserting his name in a bogus directo y.

The defeat of C. B. Fitzgerald, who has been
misrepresented as the specially-chosen labour-
candidate for Bulimba, Q., was a foregone con-
clusion. Bulimba is essentially a plural-voteis
district. For years it consistently rrturnecl
a Queen-street nominee, when Giifhtlusm
meant Queen-street versus Queensland, and the
late Ruckland, its stereotyped representative,
was a Griffithite and nothing more a land-
agent and auctioneer, au fait with all the
thimblerigging of allotment-booms. Ry-the-
way, the same Ruckland was one of Griffiths
Kanaka Commissioners, who so successfully
damned the old-time Polynesian slave-trade.
That was when Griffith was professedly
“white.” Ruckland would assuredly have
voted “black” now, had he lived ; and when
Sir Thos. MTl wraith, the other day, an-
nounced his intention to vote for J. R. Dickson
(Mac.’s former bete noir and successor at
the Treasury), it only showed that Property
was double-banking against Fitzgerald in
both Griffilwraithian sections. M'llwbaxth
may be regarded as a typical Rulimba voter.
What right has he, in any democratic
sense, to possess a vote in Rulimba t
He has a vote for Musgrave, as he
owns Gin Gin station there. He is on the
North Rrisbane roll; and probably also on
those of South Rrisbane and the Darling Downs.
In the latter district he is identified with a
squatting company. Probably, he claims his
Rulimba vote by reason of shareholding in some
meat-preserving, or ferry, or other company.
C. R. Fitzgerald is a barrister, which is bad ;
a sou of a N.Q. pioneer sugar-planter, which also
sounds badly ; but he is a man who has the grit
to believe in a white man’s own individuality,
and rvho scorns to rely on black-labour. His
father, the late Thomas Fitzgerald, was Trea-
surer in the Lilley Administration. C.R.r.
was not elected by the Labour leagues, which
split into two opposing sections concerning him,
and he himself publicly repudiated them as
being his nominators. Dickson, the new mem-
ber for Rulimba, was the Treasurer who landed
Queensland in its present financial quagmire, by
getting a 10-millions Loan Rill passed en bloc
and then squandering the proceeds right and
left. Under any system of One-man-one-vote,
Dickson would have had no more chance in
Rulimba than a dead donkey.
Hazy, moral item wired from Melbourne
The Earl and Countess of Meath to-day visited Ormond
College In an address to the students, the Earl
counselled them not to allow themselves or the educated
class to abandon the political power of the country to
wire-pullers and place-hunters, but themselves to make
mercantile and public life of the kind sweet clean, and
strong with the manfulness of genuine character simple
living and high thinking.
We know the feeble and shapeless moralist who
talks like that. When any vigorous reform is
proposed he moans through his sad, red nose
that people can’t be made good by Act of Par-
liament. When anyone proposes a scheme for
the advance of education, he wails that it is not
education that is wanted, but a Higher Tone.
When anyone has a feasible scheme for the
diminution of poverty, he says, with a grieved
sniff, that the only way to dimmish poverty is
by the spread of Terewth. When anyone wants
to do anything at all, he announces that the
people mustn’t be “ led away,” and when any-
thing is in danger of being done, he has grave
doubts as to whether the time is “ ripe And
his own remedy for everything is “ high think-
ing,” which is a sort of feeble yearning in an
easy chair—the wearing of a vacant but noble
expression behind an eye-glass the glimmer o
a lofty soul over the top of an overgrown shut-
collar. He doesn’t even say what people are to
think about, but probably he intends to re-
generate the world by musing over oil-pain tings
and art criticism. Anyhow, if the wretched
Meath hadn’t been an earl, no one would have
taken the trouble to telegraph his maunderings.
“ Thomas Driffield ” supplies, in the Maranoa
(Q.) Advocate, a cheerful picture of agricul-
tural life in the West, as seen in the new Para-
dise at Wallumbilla :
The first settler, a weakly man suffering from asthma
and dysentery, lived in a humpy that looked like an
enlarged dog-box, only the ends were fixed up with
canvas and sacks; water was half-a-nule away, and
neighbours more; he knew nothing of farming (had a
do-Meg fence for grape-culture), and his savings were
almost done. I left him under the impression that he
had settled. The next settler I suddenly came across,
sittino- under a tree making his dinner off a possum,
which was cold and laid on a handkerchief, and whether
he had shared any dinner off it previously I could not
tell but when he had finished he tied the remains in the
handkerchief, saying he would make a stew of it for sup-
per He was shaping a bucket out of a hollow log as the
last few shillings he had sent to pay a debt. He was
building a shade to make gates and such things undei
u in ” he day, that he might work at night and put in
an acre of wheat (with a fork), after which he would go
and earn, if he could, a few pounds from some one else,
and in the meantime his acre of wheat would grow and
pay the rent. This man neither drank nor smoked,
was a very good practical farmer, and as perfect
a model of industry and thrift as could he desired.
The next settler, a shrewd, hospitable man and a good
farmer also had made very fair headway. He complained
bitterly of the railway freightage, as it prohibited him
from usim' the line. He had to buy a dray and horses to
briii"- his effects from Brisbane to Wallumbilla, as the cost
of earriao-e was more than they were worth, and he would
not hesitate to yoke up his horses and go for another load.
He would gladly get fencing-wire from Bnsbane but
for the rates being so much, so he had to use laiis
instead. He said he had worked a long time in Brisbane,
but his money was done and nothing coming in. H
could "-row plenty to use, but nothing to sell. At the
next place the settler's wife told me they had been
literally starved out. She had to borrow flour whdst her
husband went away to find work. They had heard in
Brisbane such glowing accounts of Wallumbilla that they
hid sold their home for £ll, out of which the auctioneer
git four guineas. They had planted potatoes and com
nm thev came to nothing, not even enough to feed the
fowls ow?n“to the dry weather. The next two settlers
were away earning money elsewhere. Another man said
he had been away for six months working on a station and
would have to go again, as hehad no facilities for using his
land, and if he had, he could not get his k the
Another man paid 25 per cent, upon the value (at the
owner’s valuation) for the use of a forest devil, and took
all risk. At another place the settler s wife said her
husband was away looking for work, and she had not
heard from him lately. Further on, I saw a white woman
clearing the land, throwing logs into a fire, and another
woman*said she found it cheaper to sell in Brisbane the
tilings that she needed than pay carriage on then .
Several other settlers were away working for wages, an
* iriinm t mol, carrying a child in one hand and a
bucket of water in the other, had to cross the railway
lino get under four fences, and go a quarter of a
mile for water, and take her children with her to wash
them at the creek. The settler himself I saw putting up
a fence in the moonlight, and carrying the posts on his
shoulder. Industry is the one thing I alwaj s aspu e to,
and contentment also—when it is not the result of biain
auathv The people of Russia are the most contented
m Europe yet, what is their condition? The people o
Wallumbilla arc the most industrious and contented I
have met yet ; what is their prospect.
Whenever the distress is a little more marked
than usual in the Australian cities, some pomp-
ous, fat man always rises to ask why the un-
employed don’t go out into the far west, and
till the soil, and be contented. This picture of
Wallumbilla is a pleasant evidence ot what
happens to them when they do go, and the sort
of places that are left for them to go to. Ihe
pompons, fat man has grabbed all the rest.
The arguments against the continuation of
the N.B.W. Government subsidy to the Sydney
School of Arts are being placed on an absurd
plane of ethics. The question whether or not
the School should be permitted to lease its hall
to a theatrical co. has absolutely nothing what-
ever to do with the issue. The real and only point
to be considered is this ; Is the School purely
and simply a private club whose mission is to
pay dividends, or acquire property, or distribute
privileges among its subscribers ; or is it a semi-
public institution and an educational factor in a
distinct sense that differs from the private ven-
ture of any trading firm? If Sydney School of
Arts cannot justify any public phase of its
existence, it cannot establish any fair claim to
a State subsidy ; and that is all there is about
it. As a matter of fact, it ejects non-paying
visitors and gives the general public no return
whatever for the funds it has hitherto got from
the Treasury. It has long been bossed by
cliqueism, and the public —the great outside
masses—take not the slightest interest in its
success or its ruin. If Sydney School of Arts
were burnt out to-morrow, the public would
sigh not a single requiem over its corpse, nor
would it care to enquire very feelingly whether
or not the alleged loss was covered by insurance.
All Schools of Arts, in town or country, or
Mechanics’ Institutes receiving Government
assistance, should be compelled to earn that
assistance by providing free libraries and read-
ing-rooms for all-comers. Beyond that stipula-
tion, they might let their halls to dog-showmen,
or for knocking-out pugilistic exhibitions, or
for the Ministering Cadgers’ Institution, for all
that these side-matters have to do with the
question under dispute.
The Maoriland Government’s proposal that
magistrates of the territory shall be elected by
popular vote is a rightly democratic move. Its
adoption would ensure the appointment of
honorary magistrates in whom the people
chieflv concerned have confidence born of know-
ledge" It is only an extension of the principle
by which a mayor—who is in some instances
the direct choice, and in all cases indirectly the
representative of the ratepayers —is ex officio a
magistrate. At present the governmental power
of nominating J.P.s is a mere political bribe to
party jackals. It is but a matter of progressive
development to recognise the popular election
of judges, subject, necessarily, to a certain
status of qualifications in each candidate. The
public judgment in these matters could not col-
lectively go far wrong, and the periodical
opportunity of public revision would keep their
Honors wholesomely up to the mark.
The man with “ a stake in the country ” is
still asking in the newspapers: “ Why should
the Have-nots have an equal vote with the
Haves ?” His stall-fed soul revolts at the idea
that a pauper should have a voice in the govern-
ment of the country which has still returned
that miserable individual as Only a pauper after
a long lifetime of hard labour. The Bulletin
does not say that it is easily practicable under
existing conditions to confer a vote upon every
sane inmate of a public asylum or hospital and
upon every unconvicted prisoner ; but it is pre-
pared, nevertheless, to maintain the theoretical
justice of such a system. It scorns the conten-
tion that a pauper is not entitled to record his
vote because he is a pauper, and it holds
that an unconvicted prisoner—a prisoner
on mere suspicion cannot, with justice,
be deprived of any rights of citizenship,
which can only become righteously forfeited
after his conviction. If the politicians who
would deprive of the franchise all paupers and
unconvicted prisoners based their arguments on
the grounds of awkwardness of operation and
general applicability to all voters —that is to
say, that all men are equally liable to be cast
into gaol on false charges, or to come to grief
financially, just in the same way that all men
stand equal chances of being laid up with
broken legs, or influenza, at the time of an
election—their arguments would be logical ;
but when grounds of inconvenience and im-
practicability are abandoned, and the contention
is based solely upon alleged equity, and put
forward as a Tory argument, it has not the
ghost of a crutch to support its maimed
equilibrium.
Now that Premier Griffilwraith’s bill for
the re-establishment of Kanaka labour is making
good progress in the Queensland Legislature it
is about time some member rose to demand the
release of the Hopeful prisoners. These unfor-
tunates were sentenced to be hanged apparently
as an advertisement for Griffith’s anti-Kanaka
policy, and then instead of being executed they
were consigned to lifelong imprisonment, with
torture added in the shape of chains this con-
cession being granted at the last moment, when
the mob of Brisbane was going around with the
avowed determination to suspend Samuel Grif-
fith on the most adjacent lamp-post, dhey ha\ c
served as the aforesaid advertisement for a good
many years, but now that the Premier has no
anti-Kanaka policy to advertise their retention
in gaol is mere wanton and superfluous cruelty.
And, in any case, the proceedings were a
hideous burlesque upon justice from beginning
to end. The native evidence against them
was got up in the course of “ investigations
at which the accused were not represented.
Practically, they were tried in their absence by
an irresponsible tribunal. The chief witness who
appeared against them in court was an exceed-
ingly shady nigger bearing the name of Messiah ;
and their own companions who turned Queen s
evidence did so with ropes round their necks ;
either they had to go into the witness-box and
swear against the prisoners, or else to go into
the dock while the übiquitous Messiah swore
against them. It is about an even chance that
the Hopeful men fully deserved their fate, but
the law has no right to travel upon chances.
The method of their trial was an unspeakable
iniquity, and a parody upon law, and now that
Kanakilgriff has started to re-establish all the
horrors of the island labour-trade, there is no
earthly excuse for retaining in prison these men
whose only properly-prored crime was that they
were engaged in a trade of which thcii then
prosecutor is now the chief advocate.


[?]
810 Macquarie-strect North, Sydney, April 20, 1892.
Mv Dkar Moorabikda, —
N.S.IV. Agricultural Society ought to be the recognised
Mother Carey’s chicken of the show world, for when it
announces its annual symposium, I, for one, always hunt
up my goloshes. This year’s opening (on 14th hist.) was
no exception, and the wonder was that there was any
attendance at all-on such an ungrateful day. Lord and
Lady Jersey, with Lady Calloway (a good name to answer
to at a horse-show), and Goschen, with one pearl-grey-
kidded hand and the other in the stagey sling, formed the
\ ice-regal square party, and arrived very punctually at
the main pavilion, where—hut you don’t want me to
drivel about how the committee scratched the vice-
tegalities, and how His Ex, returned a flowery Roland for
an effusive Oliver, and ex-mayor Burdekin (thinner and
paler frpm his run ’Ome), in a black Tom Thumb tie, was
heartily cheered as he rose to make out a good case for
agriculture. Afterwards, the inevitable vice-regal walk-
round happened, and up to that point the ceremonies
were as smooth as silk— main aprPs ] Well, do you think
it was hospitable to Lady Jersey and Lady O. to invite
them into an “ordinary tca-and-scone Cd.” sort of rrfresh-
ment-room, where they were placed at a little table,
adorned with some sprawling silver dishes of no visible
connection with the substance of the “snack,” but
merely added to the undraped table as wondrous compli-
mentary frills? Lady Jersey was comforted at the official
lunch to which, by-the-way, the lady friends of the
officials were graciously admitted after the gentkmicn
had lunched I which struck me as a shade below (he
custom of King Billy of Bargowlahmine and elsewhere
" ho, while he eats, throws his scraps over his shoulder to
tlm gin squatting obediently behind.
Uady Jersey wore a gown of I rue grey silk with a darker
pattern, tight-fitting visite of black-beaded silk with wing
over-sleeves of black lace, bonnet of black cause and jet.
with couches of gold and while flowers with black lam-
iour, her neutral- tinted array being considerably
brightened by the beautiful committee bouquet of pink,
white and cream roses, bouvardia, and maiden hair ferns.
Losmea, the raging vegetable of last season, was absent
from the vice-regal floralily—l suppose it is no longer a
society weed since its seeds have become reduced to
thieepence per packet. Lady Galloway was a bright snot
—in a geranium-red silk turn-out quite covered by an
Ascot mantle of fine black lace, small bonnet in black
and geranium-red and sparkling jet. Apart from the
mystic V.R. circle only two dresses caught my eagle eye.
One was light tan made with a coat bodice and finished
off with bear fur, toque en suite-, the other dark-blue
serge (they do say apropos of the serviceable stuff that
there won’t be a fashionable demand for it this season
owing to its being so jauntily sported at the murder-trial)
made with a long coat to the knees and a plain vest. It
was a very business-like garment, indeed, only when the
wearer was charging over the mud she forget to haul up
her black silk “mount,” and it did look so diagglc-
tailed.
The rain blurred the appearance of most .of the turns-
out cavorting in the open, and the brave women on top
of the coaches must have been simply soaked. The same
two fours-in-hand competed —Mr. Terry’s coach, and Mr.
Sam. Hordern’s break-cum-drag—and the same thought
struck me that, were 1 judging, I’d have awarded the
laurels to the former’s vehicle and the latter’s team. The
Australian Club coach (non-competitive), tooled on to the
ground by Mr. J. de V. Lamb, in a correct London Coach,
iujf Club coat with smoked-pearl buttons, was the live-
liest vehicle in sight, perhaps because one or two of the
women wore crimson cloaks, which looked very cheerful,
through the diizzle. But why doesn’t the Club drive match
horses in the pole ?
Lots of lady riders faced the hurdles, and it was a pity
the dauntless equestrienne on a clever white nag which
jumped like a wallaby didn’t dress carefully, instead of
looming in the pigskin in a seedy turn-out topped by an
utterly monstrous tall hat with a wisp of deadly-blue veil
around it. Quite a welcome contrast was the neat, dark,
hue rig of a Diana from the Illawarra who was greatly
cheered for the way she schooled her chestnut over the.
jumps. Also I want to compliment a juvenile rider (a
pupil of that clever horseman Mr. Bnrslem, the Sydney
riding master) for the way she stuck to a big, sulky brute
which bolted across the course and jumped the fence with
her—but still I hate to see women jumping. Perhaps
because a doctoronce said : “ The woman w ho puts a horse
over a hurdle, whether she gets a tumble or whether she
doesn’t, runs a thousand risks of becoming an invalid for
life.”
St. Leger Day (by the way, if you want to be English
and all that, you pronounce it Sil. Leger, don’t you know),
w Inch was first day of the autumn meeting at. Randwick,
didn t absorb quite so gay and glittering a throng as yours
ever anticipated. There were no vice-regalities for one
thing, except brother Rupert No. 2 (I also saw' brother
Rupert No. 1 on the lawn during the afternoon), and the
gubernatorial reserve was a blank instead of an oasis in
the midst of fashion. Not that there was much fashion
either. Two Sydney ought-to-be-good-dressers-if-a-long-
pocket-has-anything-to-do-with-it, came forth in fawn
frocks, picked out with blue, that I diagramed in this
column in ’9l ! The two pretty sisters-in-law of a peer
actually sported washed- and - ironed pink prints of
summer-cut in the teeth of a wind that brought goose-
flesh, and the fact that they also wore heavy jackets,
showed that personal comfort had nothing to do with it.
And just here I must object to the clumsy trick Sydney
women —and all the English-speaking women too, so far
as that goes—have of warming up a summer frock, worn
unseasonably, with winter furs or w raps. Fur boas over
muslin lace and muslin frocks are a common autumnal
sight in Australia, but it always sets my teeth on edge
til the same Vou never see a Frenchwoman forcibly
marrying summer and winter in that hideously, un*
tasteful way in her promenade toilet.
The A.J.C. made a new departure on the lawn in the
shape of garden seats placed facing the course which were
much appreciated. Mrs. Walter Hall wore a very Worth-
like dress of Indian red silk and velvet artistically worked
up with gold galon and brown fur bonnet en suite ; Miss
Carrie Swain’s turn-out of black lace over sapphire blue
silk, toreador bodice of black passementerie with pleated
waist of sapphire blue velvet, diamond and sapphire
brooches, andjdark-blue feathered hat, took a trick ; and I
also liked a grey tweed gown severely plain, made with a
long jacket to the knees, of the same material and lined
with a lively-coloured tartan silk. Long jackets lined
with fancy materials will be the leading winter stylo,
greatly to the joy of long-limbed women, but the abbre-
viated angel whose skirt is the length of a Highlander’s
kilt must avoid them as she would avoid bell sleeves.
Mrs. VanderveerGreen, looking bright after her Maoriland
concert tour,had on a nobby, light-brownish cloak with
brown flgurings and brown fur round the ear-high collar.
“Silleger” day was rather remarkable for the many
society husbands who had left their wives behind them.
Sydney Cup-day-Easter Monday—was a move success-
ful function than the first day ; better weather resulted in
oetter frocks. Lord and Lady Jersey graciously turned
up with their two girls and Lady Galloway and her
daughter, and squired by—the whole staff, of course. It
is wonderful how ready and willing are the vice-regal
attaches when their “people ” are bound for a racecourse;
one obviously disaffected sprig of nobility is all the moral
support the Governor gets at a tea-meeting.
Lady Jersey’s outer garment of Monday seemed to bo a
bine and brown shot-silk slip covered all over with Tosca
net, small black lace and jet bonnet, with coronet of pink
roses, and a pink bow on her black gamp ; Lady Gallcway,
however, was radiant in pale-heliotrope with real lace
ruffles and bands of spangled silver ; but I didn’t like the
marigolds (kitchen variety) that graced hercream bonnet.
A vague rumour spread that Lady Meath, the “ Band of
Hope” countess, was with the party—of course she
wasn’t. Lady Meath, lam told, would rather go to the
stake than patronise a race-horse. The Jersey girls wore
plain frocks of cream floral delaine trimmed with lace ;
wide white hat and feathers. Mrs. (Capt.) M‘Neill
had a blue-and-w bite spotted costume with peach-
pink vest, and a small floral bonnet in pink and
white. Mrs. (Mayoress) Manning wore purple-
brown trimmed with brown velvet and amethyst
bows in her bonnet ; her daughter, dark-brown with
emerald green velvet points. Miss Carrie Swain’s gown
was an artistically designed coffee brown cloth picked out
with gold bullion galon, brown feathered hat, parasol and
brown shoes en suite ; Miss Lamb (just hack from Eng-
land) wore chrome-green and a flat black hat; Mrs.
(General) Tanner sported mauve and guipure, hat en
suite ; Miss Wolfe’s tailor-built tweed with a green velvet
vest was extremely neat. But I could carry on in this
fascinating way for a week since every woman seemed to
have been stirring up her dressmaker with, in the main,
really beautiful results. Only there is no silver lining
without a cloud, and I couldn’t help doubting the intellig-
ence of a woman with a bold red bow in her bonnet and
a nose-end en suite ; a.id a lovely shock of golden curls
came too close to my eye, and 1 saw the composite
scalp underneath. I can tell wigs as easily as I can detect
shop-teeth. There is a lot of false hair in Sydney, and
some day 1 am going out with fish-hooks round my parasol
and then
Billee Barlow and (incidentally) a pantomime opened at
Her Majesty's on Easter Saturday to a bee-swarm holiday
house, for every d.c. seraph appeared to have her hat
under her scat and the untutored hair which marks the
excursionist finishing up an ’oliday at the play. The only
properly-dressed woman I saw was a doctor’s wife iu a
decidedly handsome rig of fawn poplin very cunningly
diversified with moss-brown velvet, gold (loral applique
and jewelled clasps, of course one doesn’t look for an
excessive rush of clothes about the shapely form of Miss
I>-, who reminds you of Pattie Brown in her pale-grey
suit with full white muslin vest and a cheeky little grey
cap ; and she keeps up the resemblance until the last act,
when she emerges from a gilded chariot dressed in every
shade of green, from early pea to cabbage, and the lime-
light man rushes madly to the helm. I wasn’t exactly
dumb founded at the dazzle of Dick W. Some of the
ballet-girls, especially a trio in flesh-pink tights long
drawn out, looked as if they had stepped out of cigarette-
packets tor the occasion ; but why didn’t the Moorish
supes stain their visages to match their costumes and (he
stage climate? Brown legs, an Eastern garment, and an
untouched Australian face destroys the illns’on and bring
you right back from Morocco to Sydney d.c., where you
sit thinking hard, hard thoughts of the hopeless stupidity
of Toltic and Co.
There was a pas de truis dressed in flame-colour silk
frocks, made, of course, in accordeon pleats, which
showed plainly that the general idea is—what is a success
once is a success for ever. We have been haunted by the
camp-shade-ish danseuss eversince Marion Hood charmed
us so in’BB, and we have had enough of her. We don’t
want to see her waving her concertina-shaped petticoat
at the gallery any more, because we know exactly just
whore she w ill pick it up in her dainty fingers into a fan-
shape, and when she will elevate one hem above her
golden head and show all the goffered underclothing, and
the d.c. gets tired even of that. The inevitable fairy-
queen, who was followed by two smaller queens, was
reminiscent of a marionette that throws off smaller
editions of itself, and the beauteous being iu the trans-
formation scene, who surmounts a golden arch, ought not
to turn her toes in because that is how a parrot clutches
its perch, and it doesn’t look at all pretty in the lime-
light. The Lord Mayor’s procession was a pageant, and
from the especial shrieks of the gallery I gathered that
sheep-shearers and gold-diggers are the most popular
cullings of any. But, of course, the brewers got an
approving cat-call.
Sydney Philharmonic gave Mendelssohn’s “ Lobgcsang”
and Rossini’s “ Stabat Mater” for the second time on
Good Friday night, in (ho Centennial Hall, which was
well-filled with people. Lady Jersey and a Government
House party were there in severely plain costumes, and
there was very quiet dressing for the most part because it
is de rigve.uv to w ear sad and subdued attire when you
are out pleasure-seeking on a holy holiday ; but a sprink-
ling of women had come out in bare shoulders and
corsage-bouquets and seemed, quite in love with them-
selves until the bonneted vice-regal party arrived, and
then—well, it was amusing to see how they secured their
wraps to conceal their irreligious decollelee !
I cannot truthfully say that the musical part of the
programme was a complete success. The female voices
over-balanced the male, and the orchestration—brass,
strings and organ—over balanced everything. Link was
first soprano, and, being indisposed, was a failure; and
Nellie Young, in the concerted pieces, seemed to think it
was her fault when discord arose instead of harmony.
Mr. Parkinson- the tenor of the occasion-sang his music
very calmly and soothingly, but he should work hard to
improve his vocal quality. At present, his shriek seems
to come at one wrapped in wadding.
1 am told that one of the lady journalists who was v ery
conspicuous at the Windsor inquest, and who carried the
biggest note-book in the crowd, got a two line paragraph
about the affair into her paper
I have received a memorandum in blood-red ink, objec-
ting to the printer’s error which made it appear that the
leading lady in “New Men and Old Acres ” dropped her
head on to the shirt-front of the humble attorney of the
cast—but it is too late to elaborately correct it now.
Besides, you must look at it from the point of view of the
humble attorney, who doesn’t often have a leading lady’s
tresses tangled in his button-hole, even if it’s only in cold,
unsatisfactory print. He probably wouldn’t have me alter
it for worlds.
Apropos theatres—' as it never occurred to you how
inhumanly the d.c. man is treated from a cloak-room
point of view, in those dazzling halls where most of our
enjoyable evenings are spent ? So far as lam aware, only
one theatre in Australia—Melbourne Princess’—has a room
for masculine needs, and how men manage their hats and
coats in other theatres is beyond my guessing. The
popular place for a man to get into his wraps is at the top
of the stairs ; -right in the gangway is where the little
dingy excavation for the receipt of overcoats is generally
to be found, and why there isn’t a one-eyed, broken-nosed
woman or two to bear testimony to the dangers of the
arrangement is another mystery. Because a man, putting
on a top-wrap, is very much like a savage doing a short
war dance—his arms fly out, semaphore-fashion, to the
imminent peril of all within reach. At the Princess’ he is
accorded a radiant apartment—a vision of plush and gilt—
where he can curl his moustache, and contemplate the
graceful hang of his swallow-tail to his heart’s content.
Latterly, by the way, from a feminine aspect, the
theatre cloak-room is falling into disusi—perhaps because
this is an age when gorgeous opera-wraps form half the
glory of the toilet. Most women go straight to their
chairs without deviation, except, perhaps, between acts,
when some of the venturesome spirits seek seclusion and
call for—er—lemonade and a coffee-bean. But the
maelstrom in which the women fought like hyenas
to get into their wraps first, while impatient male
friends fumed outside, though you see it in its full beauty
at balls, is almost a thing of the past in theatres.
Perhaps, because Lady Jersey always walks straight in
from her carriage and peels very expertly as she sinks
into her seat.
What amuses me in this foolish world is the airs of the
woman in pince-nez. Defective sight, it appears to me, is
not exactly a thing you ought to be proud of, nor should
the woman in spectacles feci a call to morally try to
occupy twice the room of the fortunate woman who gets
along without a burden on her nose—but yet, as I said
before, the airs of the woman with pince-nez on are one
of the most amusing things on the earth. Do they
assume these supercilious frills because bad sight is usually
the distinguishing mark of the student? But, then, the
student is not necessarily fashionable, and the mole-like
way in which he or she sports glass is quite different from
the aggressive top-lofty manner in which the average
short-sighted she wears her visual crutches. I have yet
to discover why a spectacled woman should not be com-
miserated equally with the lady who goes around with an
car-trumpet, or a wooden leg.
It isn’t polite—did you know? to clap your bands
suddenly for any cause if you happen to be in the
company of a stutterer, because parents and guardians of
the same resort to short hand-claps to startle the patient
and bring him up with a salutary jerk in the middle of
his clucking. But people can’t always bear this in mind.
On a big N.S.W. run they were entertaining “an impedi.
ment in his speech ” during the mosquito season, and one
evening as they lounged on the verandah and
the stutterer was gingerly embarking on a yarn,
somebody just under his nose made a lunge at an insect
and mangled it between his palms with a banglike that of
a quartz-crusher. “ Th—th—thank you 1” said the stam-
merer with sarcastic emphasis and a scowl that had
daggers in it, and goodness alone knows how it
would have ended only there were ladies present. Polite-
ness gave the mosquitoes a clear field for the rest of his
visit.
A certain Hebrew lady the other day told her help to
collect all the silver and boil it in the copper. The
astounded menial—who didn’t know that the Passover
was imminent, when every utensil has to be vigorously
scrubbed free from the contamination of the year-set
about the task in dazed silence. But when every bit of
plate was boiling merrily, Bridget had to relieve her feel-
ings: “ Holy mother of Moses ! ’’ she exclaimed, “ ihim
Jews, the divils, is so rich that they has silver soup.”
The latest Society banns put up are those of pretty

The story goes that a titled swell, who
lately met with an injury to his hand was
taken to the city hospital, whence, after having
his wound attended to, he returned to his snug

Mr. Ebenezer Skinner, carpenter, of Pitt-
street, Sydney, a good man and a prominent Free-
thinker, started, on 26th March, for the great
Unknown. The Bulletin, in publishing his
obituary last week, alluded to him by mistake as
Mr. Skinner, bookseller, who is still alive and
visible; but all the kind things this paper said on
that occasion may stand, for deceased deserved
them all.
Four Victorian doctors, commissioned by
Government, have pronounced “Albert Williams”
to be “ perfectly sane.” His solicitor should have
no difficulty in procuring 40 other medical witnesses
to pronounce him hopelessly mad. But, ns in-
dicated in The Bulletin last week, the chosen
line of defence will be, not that Williams is insane,
taking the term in its popular sense, but that he
is an “instinctive criminal.” In other words,
that, while he possesses all his reasoning powers,
his moral faculties are hopelessly paralysed and
that he cannot control his instinctive propensity
to commit crime ; further, that he has no power
even to try to oyeriVriue his nature. Substantially
the plea raised in the Colston case : that a man is
not necessarily sane because he knows the differ-
ence between right and wrong.

As Easter week is pre-eminent in fully as
a week devoted to theatrical nonsense and ludeu-
ary frivolities, it is, perhaps, perfectly excusable
that the present management of Her Majesty’s
Sydney, should present the public with a possible
passion-play, in the guise of an incoherent panto-
mune, founded on extravagant feline traditions
and Dick - Whittmgtonian impossibilities. On
Easter-Saturday-night (if there is such a night in
any respectable saint’s calendar), Billee Barlow
with a masculine sobriquet and an amiable smile’
made her bow to a Sydney audience, which in
turn made every possible effort to bow back
again; but the house being crammed, and
jammed, and inconveniently crowded from the
gods to the pit, anything like individual move-
ment on the part of a self-respecting audience was
impossible. The gallery did, however, vent a
certain amount of exuberance, in more or less
euphonious howl, and most of the other sections
of a discriminating “’ouse ” perspired violently
with suppressed enthusiasm. * J

The burlesque, or pantomime, or variety
show, in question, suggests a number of
things In the first place, it reminds one
painfully of Paddy s Market, with the police on a
holiday. It is, moreover, a pantomime, with the
harlequin absent on an electioneering tour and the
columbine incapacitated through spraining her
ankle. Or it might be an Ethiopian entertain-
ment, minus the burnt cork. In fact, there is
only one thing certain about “Dick Whittington ”
and that is the immeasurable “ takingness ” of the
Dick of that ilk. She is fair, and, albeit not fat
at least plump enough to look imperial in lavender-
tinted tights, and, if not forty or thereabouts
experienced enough to make her own particular
trade-mark of “chic ” the despair of most of the
knowing girls who crowd a dress circle on first
nights. Billee Barlow is the life and soul and red-
heart’s core of the entire show. She sings, she
dances, she mums, and she mimes, and there is hu
limit to her infinite variety. Without her the
stage is a canvas wilderness, and with her it is a
wilderness just the same, but it is sprinkled with
vocal and soliloqual fragments and oa«es of
Billee Barlow. The remaining items of the
show are, among ten thousand, altogether lovely,
but unfortunately they have nothing to do.
1 lie Slime of other days Joses liis brilliancy in this
paiticular production ; George reminds
one of the light that has failed, and poor-old Edwin
Kelly is a pallid reminiscence of the days that an-
no more. 1 inally there is a panorama, in which
the landscape is admirably painted, but in which
also theeorpses and an i m als are suggest i ve of draped
clothes-props, from the brush of Mr. J. Brunkm;
and this is followed by a transformation scene filled
with female figures, and tinsel, and limelight; and
the whole glittering combination is concluded by
a pageant of weird magnificence, including ail
eight-hours’ procession and a Lord Mayor of Lon-
don’s show, in which Miss Billee Barlow paints
the lily and adds several hitherto unnecessary
tints to the violet and other horticultural speci-
mens, at 11.30 p.m., or thereabout.

At the Sydney Criterion, “ Eecks still
pursues Ins solitary way to the nearest pub,
round the corner, and “ Caste ” is otherwise
variously looking up under an altogether
different castal infliction. The “ Gerridge”
of Mr. Brough, with its manly ignorance of the
noble British plumber, has given way to Mr.
Bqucicault’s still more unworkmanlike version of
this representative of Deeming’s avocation, and
Mrs. Molyneux upholds the fainting-fits of the
workman’s daughter who gets matrimonially
entangled with the English officer who owns a
vicious brand of marquise for a maternal relative.
Miss Watt-1 aimer supplants Miss Bonier in the
character of the marquise in question, and most
people who have witnessed her predecessor in the
part are sorry that she has done it; but it cannot
be helped, seeing that “The Solicitor” requires
the genuine feminine D’Alroy in the city of smells
and nielliflnousness. On Monday, the 25th ilist.,
Mr. Geo. W. Anson is to be tendered a grand and
gorgeous benefit, in which the world and his wife,
including Mr. Jim Brewer Toohey, M.P., as
Cardinal Richelieu - not Cardinal Moran, w ho is a
teetotaller and drinks ginger-beer out of a stone-
bottle at lunch daily—will take an active, a pro-
minent, and an altogether pardonable part.

At Sydney Royal, Bland Holt and “Master
and Man ” continue to hold the mirror up to tiie
lurid imaginations of Messrs. Pettitt and Sims,
and a vast deal of severely chastened joy is ex-
tracted by the Sydney daily press, from the fact
that a female character in this extravagant melo-
monstrosity has been alternately saved from
nothingness by Miss Kate Bishop and Miss Edith
Blande. For our own part, we do not think that
the rule will be adequately supported until Mr.
ever-Bland Holt himself sustains it —though this
may be merely a matter of transpontine opinion ;
still, we give it for what it is worth. “Master
and Man,” we are delighted to record, will be
succeeded, on the 23rd hist., by “The Trumpet
Call,” when the gruesome furnace of a lurid hue
in the present production will be replaced by the
instrumental crochets and quavers of a military
summons to a stage combat.

The Garrick Theatre has been well filled
of late by the votaries of the Tuscan muse; but,
inconsequence of a mental denseness regarding
dates, and the impingement upon the Italian
scene of trans-Atlantic opera-bouffe, the folk
whose worship is by tradition devoted to the swan
of Pessaro, have of late been switched off into
frivolous channels and appropriated by a fat
comedian and a scant-dressed ballet. Notwith-
standing the appearance of the “Evangeline”
troupe, out of season and between times, the
Italian Opera Company has been putting in some
very good work with “Lucia,” the “Barber,”
“ Eaust," and other assured classics, and the
season may be justly regarded as a faiily success-
ful one. This is a commonplace remark ; but
wdiat can one say of a farewell “week” that lasts
a month ?

Sells’ great circus is about to break out
afresh in Sydney, where it will play a final season
ere returning to the land of G. Washington and
Bunker Hill, Esq. The huge show is now all
complete, a new batch of horses having been
trained to take the places of the lamented animals
which were missing by N.S.W. Act of Par-
liament on its previous visit, and the prices
have been reduced all round to the lowest
minimum on record. When the company made
its first appearance in Sydney it was suffering
from mental depression brought about by an
altogether unlooked-for disaster, and on that
occasion the city rolled up so unanimously
and cheered so vociferously that the firm
experienced a glow in the middle of its
waistcoat, and began to feel better. It is
going to play a fresh season at ridiculously low
prices to show its gratitude for that bygone enthu-
siasm, and it also issues a notice in which it
metaphorically embraces New South AVales and
promises to feel towards it as a long-lost brother
for evermore. On the strength of this mutual
affection the Bulletin rises to suggest that when
the circus gets home once more it should put a head
on John L. Sullivan, even if it has to start two
elephants after that blatant pugilist to do it.
Johnel’s language about this country is of the most
awful and uugentlemanly character, and if the
circus will enter into a bond to wallop him on its
return the excitement here will be absolutely
boundless, and the takings will increase GO per

“ The Solicitor,” having just come ove r
from Sydney with a big professional reputation)
opened a new season at Melbourne Bijou on
Saturday, when the excited populace rushed in
and scrambled for tickets, like punters who have
got to windward of a “dead bird.” Their con-
fidence in “The Solicitor” was justified. That
legal luminary took the piece between his teeth,
tied his tale in a knot, and romped home an easy
winner in one of the fastest times on record.
“The Solicitor ” is a “ roarer ” who seems likely
to stay, and lie can be trusted—let us change the
line of metaphor—to send in his bill regularly for
some time to come. A sketch of his wild career
appeared in The Bulletin so recently, that it
doesn’t need re-printing on the present occasion.
He is simply a licensed extortioner, of unblemished
character, who borrows a hansom cab from out-
side a pub., and drives everybody to distraction.
In his brief capacity of cab-driver he “ picks up ”
the wife of his bosom by the road-side, and comes
to the conclusion that she’s a shilling fare,
but very frail person. The black shadow
■of an unknown man on a window - blind
haunts him badly, and his life is beset by
a swarm of females in distress who beseech
3iim to supply divorces, at a fortnight’s notice, on
account of something distantly connected with
the cabman’s daughter, a damsel who, in the
meantime, has hired the miserable attorney to
assist in discovering his own whereabouts so that
lie may hand himself over to justice. The pathos
of the story is deepened by the frequent arrival
and departure of sundry military officers who
suffer from a chronic state of uniform, and are
perfect martyrs to their swords. As with all per-
formances of farcical comedy that carry the
B. and B. brand, “The Solicitor ” is excellently
well played and mounted. Manager Brough in
the name-part is backed up by the bulk of the
Sydney company, whilst Mrs. Brough, as the wife
who loses her diamonds, is a new and tender
feature in the cast.
Bridget O’Brien fades away at the Royal
and little Nora is unhooking that quaint, old
Celtic institution for the last nights. Also, the
gallant major will make but two more revolutions
on his cork-leg, and numerous other items, includ-
ing several of a most harrowing character, must
quit the garish scene forthwith. It is hard to part
with the Widow forever, but the reflection that
she hasn’t left her variety company to carry on
the business will temper the wind to the shorn
lamb, and give that patient animal strength to
bear its cross. On Saturday the indomitable
Bridget will appear as Conn, in “ The Shangh-
raun,” supported by a company described as
entirely new.

Dampier pegs away steadily at the
Windsor Tragedy reef, which promises to pay
decent dividends as long as Williams is in the
■land. “ Wilful Murder ” has already reached its
fifth week at the Alexandra, and the corpse in the
■first act is improving with practice, and getting
more interestingly dead every night. In its
lighter moments, too, “Wilful Murder ” is under-
stood to be “ a feast of fun,” whilst Dampier pops
up frequently amidst the blood and humour,
and says something that causes the villain to turn
pale. To-morrow the course of crime will be
interrupted by another Shakespearian Friday,
with “Hamlet” instead of Hearthstone.

“Carmen,” as given in English at Mel-
bourne Princess’, will-satisfy the proud possessors
of cultivated ears, and please those outer bar-
barians, the general public, who expect a more
glittering entertainment for their money than the
average Italian opera caterer is able to provide
“Carmen” is a large contract for the Princess’
company to tackle, but they carried it out in a
satisfactory manner on Saturday. A few trifling
differences arose between the principals and the
orchestra, the fiddlers seeming to be most at fault;
hut, generally speaking, a state of harmony pre-
vailed. '1 he chorus, a specially-important con-
sideration in this rowdy opera, was always good,
and the Ballerinas brought their legs into play
with beautiful effect. Unfortunately the Bal-
lerinas— bless ’em !—are too seldom to the
fore. They ought to bo interpolated into
each of the four acts, without regard for
the plot. Marie Hilton’s light, thin voice
adapts itse’f to the music of the all - per-
vading gipsy, which includes no catchy solo
and is really subordinate to the dramatic require-
ments of the part. She labours under the awful
disadvantage of having to lavish her scorn, and
hatred upon a scarecrow tenor, who isn’t worthy
(,f s ° much emotion, but she persuades the audience
that she is taking this object of derision in
passionate earnest, and she forces him to kill her
at tlie finish whether he likes it or not. Un-
doubtedly Miss Halton is a strong Carmen, to be
w B i to kefi P the house from “ guying ” William
VValshe. Time has not developed any histrionic
genius in Walshe, nor has the costumier treated
hun kindly. He cuts, throughout, the sort of
figure that the boys of Great Britain commit to
the flames on November the Fifth. For one thing,
you can’t see his nose most of the time, although
there is expert authority for stating that a chalk-
bae down (he middle of his boko will supply
this deficiency. However, W.W. has a voice
which rises to the occasion, albeit it is rather
metallic when it gets to the summit. Ryley is
vocally and personally effective in the showy
Torrcador character. Flora Graupner sings her
pretty airs in the third act in almost her old form,
whilst Howard Vernon and Leumane are huge
successes as the serio comic brigands. Vernon
comes out strong on the sing when the unusual
effort is expected of him. And this reminds us
that he never fails to do all that is expected, and
a bit over. They ought to pay his passage to
Europe, and re-engage him in Paris, or some-
where, at a gigantic salary, as Vernon Howard.
Allan Morris warbles l.ke an artist in a minor
position, a remark that also applies to Mesdatnes
Florence Young and Varley. As for tin 1 scenery,

Business declined considerably at th e
Opera House last week, and the sudden illness o*
Herbert Standing was a special misfortune. Mr
Standing’s part of Charles Surface was taken for
two nights by his son, Guy Staunton, who, con-
sidering his extreme youth and ill-fitting clothes,
gave a surprisingly clever reproduction of the
paternal relative. “ Fedora” couldn’t be set up
on Saturday, but was solemnly promised for
Monday last, by Avhich time the leading gentle-
man would probably not be well enough to appear
as Loris. Wherefore a notice of “Fedora” is
reserved until matters have shaken down comfort-
ably.

At St. George’s Hall, Melbourne, the
Coghill’s are providing a novelty in the form of a
complete French marionette show. The other
halls have done great Easter business, but the
black Jubilee Singers, mostly a different crowd to
the last lot who used to go Stealing Away to
Jesus, are not at a heavy premium thus far. The
Cyeloramas flourish anew, and the Exhibition
Concerts are attended by thousands who can’t get
near enough to swear that a concert is really
taking place. Also the Waxworks prospers to a
prodigious extent. The murder of the last Mrs.
Deeming in wax caused such a rush of visitors
from the interior that several of the old-established
figures suffered severe contusions in the struggle.
Sir Henry Parkes had to be taken off to Kreit-
mayer’s private hospital in a cab, and put into

unpremeditated.

Shouldn’t it he beneath the dignity of Bernard-Beere’s
reputation to publish extracts from the Melbourne
“ butter ” press in the Opera House advts. ? “No wonder
the audience were enthusiastic. They would indeed have
been doltish had they not seen that once more the artist
had gained for herself a new road to their admiration ” is
drivel which only tends to make a tired public suspicious
of Mrs. 8.-B.’s claims to distinction.
Writes a (Bulletin correspondent from London:—
“Rumour speaks highly of a new contralto, a Miss
Stirling, of Nova Scoria, who will probably make her
debut in opera in London this year. It is said that no
such voice has been heard since Alboni retired, and that
this young lady is a splendid actress. Marches! is her
teacher. Miss Stirling told a friend of mine the other day
that she had heard Florence Saville sing in Paris, and that
she had lovely notes in her voice. Unfortunately, how-
ever, there is a break in her register, which, so far, lias
baffled Marchesi’s skill as a teacher to correct. Until this
difficulty is surmounted she will not try her fortune on
the operatic stage.”
Dampier advertises the names of 26 dramas and come-
dies left with him in MSS., beseeching the authors to
come and take them back. Hew many has Coppin got?
But we suppose all that trouble is thrown away. The
consolation is that Sims hawked his “ Lights o’ London ”
round all the London managers. Garnet Walch is not in
want of raw material, anyway. He magnanimously
demands that the 26 he carted off.
A Melbourne showman says he is prepared to spend

Clement Scott, writes in London Daily Telegraph of
Nellie Stewart’s “really brilliant performance as Bhu-
Eyed Susan,” ancVndds “ She did not do herself justice
at the outset, owing to intense nervous depression and
general ill-health. This young lady fully justifies all the
praise showered upon her by our kinsfolk, for she is as
good an actress as she is a singer in the artistic school of
Florence St. John.”
The special Easter fascination of Coogee (Sydney) this

None so deft at a post-mortem as Dr. Neild, Melbourne’s

Max O’Reli, who, a few years ago woke up one morning
to find himself famous as the author of “John Bull and
His Island,” and who immediately decided to give up
“ professing ” French at St. Paul’s school and take to

form, will arrive in Sydney next week and commence hit
Australian tour under Monsieur R. S. Smytho’s manage-
ment, in the Centenary Hall. If the O’Rell is only half

Irving’s revival of “ Henry VIII.” lately raised an ad-
miring Cockney to such a pitch of excitement that he
wrote offering the “services of his real baby to personate
the king’s offspring.” Irving’s manager w rote back de-
clining' the real offspring-in these terms: “If your real
baby were provided it might he difficult or even impossible
for the actor who represents King Henry VIII. to feel the
feelings of a real father towards it. This would necessitate
your playing the part of the king, and further would re-
quire that your wife should play the part of Queen Anne
Boleyn. This might not suit either of you, especially as
in reality Henry VIII. afterwards had his wife's head cut
off.”
The libel-action, in which the MacMahons got £5OO

This item is from a small religious paper published in
Melbourne: “ A Fatal Example.—A man who bore the
reputation of a Christian at home, being in the oily, went
to the theatre, thinking the act would never he known.
Some years after, he was sent for to visit a dying man.
This man charged him with the ruin of his soul. While
young, he had seen the professed Christian enter the
theatre, and followed his example ; saying to himself,
that, if a Sunday-school superintendent could do this, he
could. He had become hardened in sin, and now lay
hopeless in death, but felt that the crisis of his life was
that fatal example.” Mr. Brough is hereby invited to
gum th s warning in his hat.
In the old alluvial days Harry Daniels used to pioneer
a company round the’goldfields, and was an immense
favourite with the diggers. They always barracked for
Daniels, and when the character he was playing got into
a tight place they lent him their moral support. Once he
was acting the massive villain in a dramatic version of
“ Ernest Maltravers,” and, kneeling before the heroine, he
implored her to “ Take me, oh, take me, 1 beseech you !”
“Yes, you take’im, Miss,” saida stentorian voice from
the gallery ; “lie’s a d d fine fellow. I’ve knowed
him for years.”
Charles A. White, musical composer, just dead in
Boston, made his first great success with “ But me in my
little Bed.” He began as a farm labourer, made a fiddle
out of a cigar-box, and turned dancing-master. Lastly,
he directed almost the largest music-publishing business
in America, and his song, “ Marguerite,” sold a million
copies.
Ashby Sterry tells a good story of the renowned Ama-
teur Pantomime, when Bidwell was harlequin, and the
great George Robins, auctioneer, was clown. Yates and
three other swells made up for a well-known party of two
gentlemen and two ladies, all dreadful pomposities,
accustomed to occupy the stage-box, and then took their
seals in that very box, being taken by the audience for
the pomposities. Well, the clown somersaulted slap into
the lap of one of the ladies, and the audience shouted
with horror, after which all the box occupants were torn
out upon the stage.
The first performance of “Captain Swift ” at Melbourne
Bijou, the other Saturday, was a staggerer for some
members of the Bernard-Beere Company, who didn’t
expect such a capital show, or dream that it could go like
clockwork on the opening night. Result-extra careful
rehearsals of “As In a Looking-Glass.”
The iron-bar of an awning arrangement, projecting
from the verandah in front of the circle entrance to Mel-
bourne Princess’s descended, with a sickening thud, upon
Lord Esme Gordon’s patrician hoof, the other night. A
servant of the theatre warned his lordship to get off the
kerb for fear of a calamity, but in vain. The scion of an
ancient race observed that he was all right, bat jove!
Whereupon the chastening rod smote his five toes at one
fell swoop, and they had to take him to the hospital in a
cab.
The farewell nights of Elton were saddened by some
striking illustrations of the fact that the public regard for
“ a great popular favourite ” doesn’t ensure a wild rush to
see the last of him in a stale show. But then Melbourne
people are not addicted to sentiment. Anson’s last
appearance as Eccles didn’t fill the Bijou to suffocation,
as a good hotchpotch show will probably fill it when
G. W. A. takes a benefit on the 30th.
The MacMahon flavour is perceptible in the Melbourne
Royal advts. Last week there was the promise that “An
important announcement will be made on Saturday next.”
The overwhelming importance of the Macs 5 ’ announce-
ments was a monotonous little joke.
An attempt to get Elton “lumbered” on a writ of
capias at the last moment was a miserable failure. William
seems to have been bitten to a small extent in the land
boom, and the blessed shindykit wanted to hold him over
as a guarantee that all his bills would be met, or some-
thing. However, the little comedian came out of the con-
fusion in a creditable manner, and the judge refused
point blank to let him be taken captive on the night of his
farewell ben.
Signora Tessero, sister of our Signora Majeroni, died
in Italy a few weeks ago. This lady was accepted as in
the shoes of Rislori, and Sardou was enthusiastic over her
acting in his “Patrie,” for he could see nothing like it
in France, Bernhardt not having taken up the part. But
how the Italians do act!

Good Friday, in Melbourne, is the most precious hum-
bug on earth.’ Public-houses all open, theatres all closed,
unless for a money-making sacred-concert, which, for
that reason, is a greater desecration than a performance
of “Carmen,” “Widow O’Brien,” “ Fedora,” or “ Wilful
Murder.” Actors don’t get a proper holiday, for the
night is tempting to rehearse the Easter piece. Then,
how can managers afford to pay salaries and lose from
. £lOO to £2OO-on their own showing?
People try to persuade M. D’Arc, of the marionettes, or
fantoches, to give up a fad, but he won’t, for he is one of
the most peculiar men you ever met. He drags round
with him everywhere a monstrous two-horse waggon,
carrying the whole show, fantastically painted over.
Harry Cogill laughs at D’Arc’s whimsies, with his Noah’s

One of Melbourne’s solid musical professors is Ernest
A. Jager, conductor and violinist. His mother was the
theatrical costumiere of the G. V. Brooke days, predecessor
of Tilly Earl’s mother, and Ernest can never be sufficiently
thankful for having escaped Poverty Point. His debut at
12 years old was in the Pantomime Harlequinade, where,
dressed as Richard Ilf., he jumped out of aGloster cheese.
He was Paul in the first Melbourne “ Octoroon ” produc-
tion, with Marie Duret, Leroy, and Fawcett ; but when
Jefferson acted Salem Scudder, Jager had grown too big,
so Julia Edouin took it.
Cathcart has acted 100 parts in 30 of Shakespeare’s

Marius is the most popular of the Bernhardt-Beere
crowd. As stage-manager, he is a model of courteousness
and painstaking. Such veteran stage-managers as Emery
and Cathcart are serving under him, and yield him every
kudos. The bullying and swearing stage-manager is not
quite extinct, nor the brute who tries to destroy the self-
respect of every lady, with his oaths and familiarity. On
the cherubic side the names of Vincent, Bracy, and Wal-
lace rise to mind.

GOOD-BYE TO ELTON.
Good-hye, farewell! the anchor’s weighed,
Your bark is on the ocean blue,
And we, disheartened and dismayed,
Are left to hanker after you.
You’ve been the soul of many shows,
The sole support—so full of snap ;
But you are gone, and Goodness knows
Whom we can get to fill the gap.
Good-bye! old chap.
In “ Blow for Blow ” you made your bow,
We blew your trumpet straight away ;
Yet blow for blow you give us now
By going thus, alackaday !
Yoii have enjoyed a thumping screw,
And worked to earn it with a will.
The while your name in favour grew
Your price went higher tip the hill.
Good-hye ! dear Bill.
Most funny stars are apt to wane
And qui t the heavens all too soon,
But you, again and yet again,
Have risen like a funny moon,
And beamed upon the roaring crowd
Whose sides you never failed to shake ;
With one accord they all allowed
That “ Elton fairly took the cake,
And no mistake !”
AVhen other lips and other hearts
Their tales of admiration tell,
A 7 ou’ll not forget the good old parts
In which we learned to love you well;
Nor let the cruel hand of time
Proud memories of yore destroy.
In distant land, in colder clime,
We evermore will wish you joy.
Good-bye, good hoy !
The Wild-Cat Column.
Wiio in the South does not remember the extra-
ordinary prospectus issued in connection with tlie Blai k
Mountain Proprietary silver mine? Two “ most n spec t-
able” individuals proclaimed it another Broken Hill, and
were believed. Inasmuch as it included the word “ Proprie-
tary ” it was like unto Broken Hill. Thousands of pounds
have been expended on it simply because certain interested
persons would not give hi that it was a rank duffer, l.et

Notwithstanding the constant banking of so
many thousand ozs. of specimens from Emmett and
Hughes’ claim, Hill End, a crushing of some 12oz. to the
lon, and lots of other evidences of richness, a company
is being formed, so we are told, to enable them to
treat the pyrites. Altogether too weak. Often with
the intention to do much good, the local newspaper cor-
respondent makes an ass of himself and damns the nv.ns
with sickening eulogy.

Obviously as an answer to our reference to the
Butchers’ Reef (New England) mine, the legal manager
wires the result of a recent crushing -71 oz. f.om 45 tons.
If Hie crushing had been twice as large, and the reef were
twice as big, there would be no dividends in it. Were
the crushing raised for nothing, the return would only
pay a farthing on the capital, £200,000, instead of which,
from what the writer knows of the reef, it will only pay
expenses.

By the way, we lately heard of a mine which,
just ere being Boated for £200,000, was refused for £5OO.

His latest is “ great excitement at Whipstiok caused by
striking a rich gold' reef.” We know it. The writer has
been to Whipstiok in the midst of a whirlwind of excite-
ment. He could not stand it and came away broken-
hearted. To pass through Whipstiok in the day-tima

night is an absolute certainty.

As an answer to The Bulletin’s strictures on
Pam hula goldfield Bega Gazette quotes the final cleaning-
up of the Mt. Gabon mine. One swallow does not make

to fall, and we are sorry to say they are not low enough
even now.

In 24 hours recently Broken Hill mining stocks

The amalgamation of the Union Bank and Bank

Dear Bulletin,— Be a recent remark of yours,
it does not follow that a dividend-paying mine naturally
occupies a better place in the market quotations than a
non-dividend-payer. As a matter of fact, the mine that
is barely paying expenses is generally “better buying,”
from a speculator’s point of view, than a dividend payer.
As soon as a mine settles down to the payment of regular
dividends it ceases to be a mine that has much charm for
the speculator, and begins to be looked on as an invest-
ment. The dividend is reckoned as interest on capital
invested, and you will seldom find the market value of (he
shares more than ten times 'the amount of the annual
dividend—that is, the dividend is merely looked upon as
a ten per cent, interest on the capital invested in the
stock. Except at boom times, nothing will inflate the
value of dividend-paying stock. Whatever is unknown
is thought to he magnificent,” is the translation of the
old Latin proverb, and it is the mines of unknown value
that the punters of the Stock Exchange love to play with.

The newspaper men who fix up the cables are
remarkably dense as to the situation, character, or value
of Australian mines. Last week the public were informed
that “Mount Morgans are selling in London at £6 35.,
being a fall of 7s. per share” ; also, in the same issue,
that sales of Junctions North were made in Melbourne at
£3 10s. “ Would it were true !” must have been the wish

The announcement that a property called the
“Great Eastern Lode” lias been floated in London, has

The S.A. Labour-party have decided to pur-

The impression prevails that there is no known
method of treating the Broken Hill sulphide ores. They
can he treated in many ways. The difficulty to overcome
is to treat them economically. They are too poor in silver
for the adoption of any expensive method, and even the
proposals made by Schnaeoel, the German metallurgist,
do not indicate any material margin of profit.

A story of an heroic Cousin Jack. Two of
them one a devout Bible Christian veteran, the other a
young man who drank and gambled more than half his
wages-were working together in a hard and deep winze.
They had bored, charged, and tamped a hole. At the
windlass was a man ready to haul up one man when the
two would pull up the man who fired the blast. The
young man accidentally fired the fuse with his own
candle; finding that the tamping would not allow the
fuse to he withdrawn, both rushed to the rope. The man
above could not haul two at once. He tried and failed.
Instantly the old man cried out; “ You go. Tom-per-
haps I’m better prepared lo die than thee art.” Away
went Tom, and the old hoy simply stood right up in one
corner of the winze to await certain death. Ere Tom
reached the brace the shot went off and a small stone
struck him on the forehead. Miraculous as it may seem,
the old man escaped unhurt, although the blast threw
enough rock abort to kill a dozen men. We have read
this somewhere Ufore- in a Sunday school book.

Frank Madden, a candidate for Melbourne
Eastern suburbs, is no foe of the working man, it
appears, “so long as he keeps his place and attends
to his business.” It is only when the working

that he becomes “dangerous.” Let the vulgar
son of toil but lie still, and lawyer Frank M. will
continue to sit on him in a friendly spirit.

ran out a. plank from a ship’s side.
Eight of the candidates returned without
opposition to Victorian Parliament declared
in favour of one-man-one-vote, and five for the
bricks-and-mortar franchise. A statement appears
that three out of the four Ministers returned

could state their individual convictions! No
opportunity should bo lost of making these poli-
ticians absolutely commit themselves whenever
they appear on a public platform.
The British cableman : “ The loyalty of
the Sultan to British interests in connection with
Egypt is doubted.” Which is a truly British way
of putting it, and about as reasonable as if some
cableman had expressed his fears that the Aus-
tralians weren’t loyal to the Chinese in Australia,
or that France wasn’t loyal to the Germans during
the invasion of 1870. When the Englishman
annexes another man's land without tiie
slightest shadow of reason or law, he always feels
hurt when the previous owner isn’t “loyal.”
The white man up North is far less in-
dignant at being supplanted by the Polynesian
nig. than at the underhandedness and despotism
of the Kanakilgriff. If the white had been
defeated at the poll on the black slavery question
he would feel that he had so far been beaten
fairly (in spite of the absence of manhood suffrage
and one-man-one-vote with no property qualifica-
tion) ; but to be denied the usual appeal to the
country on an absolute reversal of the policy on
which the Legislative Assembly xvas elected , is felt
to be pure despotism, and Judas-like treachery on
the part of Griffith, “the friend of the working-
classes. ”
A Conservative candidate in Victoria gives

man who lias neither house, land, nor shares can’t
get away at any time unless lie goes on foot, and
even then his boots would give out before he

After much preliminary puff, parson G. D*
Buchanan, who poses as Brisbane’s fancy preacher,
delivered a wobbly sermon on the Kanaka question.
He confessed that he had to “trim” on the
subject. He propounded the two questions:
“Will tiie Kanakas be a panacea for the existing
depression in Queensland?” and, “Is the
importation and employment of Kanakas im-
moral?” And to both these questions, he gave
two answers—“ Yes ” and “No !” “ Yes,” if- so-
and-so ; and “No,” if thus-and-thus! Which
evidenced plainly that Buchanan in this matter
wants botii of two bundles of hay.
The political beau-sabreur of old, David
Gaunson, entering the Victorian political arena
disguised in the black-crape of Toryism, cuts a
sorry and despicable figure. The radical throat
that gulped down the fiery wine of undiluted

two-votes, and hoorays for the suspended railway
commissioners. This should help to drag down
the Tory party, for the Tories themselves can
surely never trust Gaunson, whose apostacy from
his old congenial professions must have been born
of despairing idiocy. The once brilliant Radical

George of Wales, it appears, doesn’t like
the prospect of being Duke of Australia and wants
to bo created Duke of Lancaster. Lancaster has
been about as unlucky a title as Clarence, and ha
brought disaster to a good many of its holders.
Henry IV. held it, and was a miserable wretch
with epileptic fits. Henry V. took it over, and
died young with a mysterious complaint assumed
to be leprosy. Then it passed to Henry VI., the
gentle lunatic who was poll-axed in the Tower,
and his son, who was butchered by Gloucester
and Clarence. Since then the title has been kept
pretty much out of sight. If it is revived now
George will die young like his brother, and the

The N.S. Wales Trades and Labour
Council simply elongates its ears in proposing to
petition the British Government to meddle with

of Australia’s self-governing incapacity and an
appeal to the Imperial authorities to interfere with
our chosen Parliaments, The Queensland electors

B. R. Wise on Parkes :
Sir Henry Parkes’ is a complex character, which I would
not attempt to analyse ; but he is a man of real greatness,
both of intellect and character. Remembering that he
began life as an agricultural labourer, that he was 39
before he entered Parliament, that he had to train himself
without the aid either of h’gh examples or stimulating
criticism, and that he lias always been opposed by Tory
cliques, the strength of which in a small community was
more easily felt than would have been the case in England
—remembering this, I say, ins career and present position
justify me in saying as a considered expression of
opinion that as a Parliamentarian he onjit to nnk with
Sir Ronert Peel and Mr. Gladstone. Uo has a singular
personal charm, though he has weakened his personal
influence t>y a certain unsociahility and indifference to the
opinions of those who “ bore ” him. No one was ever less
able than he to follow the scriptural adage “and suffer
fools gladly.’ His literary qualifications are of a very
high order, though, like Wordsworth, he lacks the criti-
cal faculty which enables him to distinguish his good work
from his bad. It may he interesting to mention that
Walter Savage Landor is his favourite author-curious
tiiis in one who has had no classical training. His
power of speech is consummate. He is the only man in
Australia whose speech has the distinctive qualities cf
oratory. Without having Sir. Gladstone s masteiy of
detail, he has something of the same power of winding
into his subject and making it loom before the eves of
his audience without any apparent effort; and, although
lie has the trick of dropping his ‘ hV almost as badly as
the late Sir George Jcssel, his diction is forcible, elevated,
and correct. lie has the faculty w hich John Bright had
of lifting his subject to the highest level.”

tary-looking man who
seldom smiled, who had
reputedly won glorious
wounds in fighting the
Waikato Maoris, who
could and did lecture
on such abstruse profun-
dities as hydraulics and hydrostatics, who
kept a perfect armory of modern small
arms, and, above all, who habitually carried
a shooting-iron and a ferocious-looking knife.
Two years afterwards when he so cleverly
broke gaol at Ballarat, and doubtless visited
chums at the Marsh, he could, had he only
known, have commanded the undying allegiance
of one of his youthful worshippers. Had he come
my way, I would have sheltered and fed him as
faithfully as even Highland Kern harboured
Prince Charlie. Luckily for me he didn’t know,
or mine might have been the fate that in after
years befell young Warnecke, who was shot by
the police at Wantabadgery, fighting, the pluckiest
of Moonlight’s gang. Or, I might have been
hanged with him, like his poor tool, Hogan, whom
it was a brutal shame to hang; for the arch-fiend

Daffy’s Contemporary Review paper, on
the Mills, leads you to reflect on how some gifted
men find their women, like Alfieri, Gladstone,
Mill, Disraeli, Flaxman, Pericles, Moore, Bis-
marck, Blanchard, Booth, Chas. Kean, Kendal,
Browning, while others don’t, like Socrates,
Milton, Byron, Dickens, Bulwer, Scott, Berlioz,
Carlyle. Fancy Lady Byron asking her husband
“ when he is going to give up his bad habit of mak-
ing verses?” and Lady Scott’s speech : “ When wo
want money, Walter can write one of Ins rubbishy
novels.” What a gulf between the artist and the
Philistine bourgeoisie ! When the artist’s woman
is in somebody else’s possession, the tooth has to
be pulled out, d la Millais and Buskin.

Tithonus, Junior.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
My father was a son of the Morning, and beloved
of Her. His bright and ever-youthful face
carried always the impress of Her blessing and
kindly care. He had asked more than the old
Tithonus: life was not enough, he had asked
eternal youth, and it was given bounteously as
by “ wealthy men who care not how they give.”
The nurse, so he explained it, at the moment of
birth took him to the window, and Aurora, peep-
ing through the blind, saw and adopted _ him.
When I was nineteen he was forty-one, but in all
else but dates, which often mean naught, we were
the same age—of the two he was slightly the
younger. .
My mother died when I was sixteen, and for
three years my father slowly drifted from
the responsibilities of parentage into the
more congenial attitude of companionship
until we shared the same rooms in Gray’s Inn,
and had everything in common from our loves
down to our banking-account. We tossed each
morning to decide who should open the “small
bottle,” and never quarrelled but once ; it was
about a girl at the Criterion bar, who had given
me, he considered, more than my share of her
smiles. He sulked for an hour after we reached
home, and for once forgot his good form. It was
his turn to toast the anchovies ; he excused him-
self on the ground that he was not hungry it was
the Hrst time I had scored, so I sat it out, forgiv-
ing him. Presently he arose, walked twice across
the room, then, stopping right in front of me,
extended his hand, saying “ Pardon me, old man,
I have been rude to you, but the thing hurt me.
If you don’t mind we’ll dine for a day or two at
Ketuer's, where the attendants are neuter.”
WEDNESDAY, BOURKE-STEEET (3 a.m.).

One night—wo had for five years drunk pleasure
to the dregs and spent practically all our money,
some fifteen thousand—we were again d|mng at
Ketner’s. Not this time because of any difference
of opinion, but we needed quiet, a table to our-
selves, small courses and watercress with our
°'*At the end of dinner he (my fatVr), stirring

Jack, the play’s over and I don t see why you
should stay ah’d see the lights go ou--. Ihere is a
clear thousand left. We’ll divide it and you 11
start for Australia on Tuesday leaving me to
settle with the Jews. Life will be cold without
you, old man but it is not fair to let you stay.
Then, filling his glass with sparkling Burgundy,
he held it to the light and watched the bubbles
breaking lilies white on liquid roses. Had we
the sense of the Ceans, Jack,” he sighed, who
when tired of life or nearing old ago, met at a
sumptuous banquet, and, when all was over and
the best things said, pledged each other m poisoned
wine, and so went of their own free will -boldly
and together into the Great Unknowable—if wo,
I say, had only their pluck, this bottle would have
been doctored for us to order. Pass your glass.
“ But we have not lost our youth aiid energies.
“Pardon me, Jack, you talk with the sweet
simplicity of a country curate. Youth and ener-
gies, indeed ! they are but the tools of the sadly
industrious, the trace-chains of cart-horses. Our
mission in life has been to he only. Don t stare.
Jack, I’ll put it more clearly. We were fortunate
in the selection of our ancestors—a patient race
who plodded on collecting currents, as it were
that, reaching us, broke into the electric light
a splendid inactivity. Do you see that? he con-
tinned, spinning a sovereign on the C J°™T ‘“i
is the alkaloid of their sweating bottled up and
aid down for us in Threadneedle-street, but it is
about the last.—
The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
la left, this vault to brag of.
But let’s be happy the last night, let’s go and see
the girl.”
“The Girl” was a piece of Surrey, who had
stepped straight from her dairy into the Burling-
ton to sell gloves—and we found her there as men
find opals in a Hint country, and fell simultane-
ously in love with her. Her cheeks had borrowed
the bloom of her roses, and about her hung the
fragrance of buttercups ; her teeth were white
as a hound’s, and her eyes could “ snap like a
cap.” Add the impenetrable armour of sweet
innocence that made her unafraid even in the
Burlington, and you have Flipps, the girl that all
unconsciously caught the hearts of both of us in
the meshes of her smiles.
We competed honourably, my father (or ii.
Junior, as I preferred to call him) and I for the
clean love of this girl, but never discussed the
matter until one day, he, I remember, had taken
her a pearl ring and I a bunch of orchids the
white flower of a blameless life. We met by acci-
dent at the Bond-street entrance, and walked in
silence for a time, busy with our own thoughts,
when suddenly Ti. took my arm and said : “ Who-
ever wins must take care of her.” At the
Criterion corner he pulled up short with “ What
do you say to making a dead-heat of it and educat-
ing her between us? ”
It was always six to four on Ti. —so I consented
and the next morning we sold out .£3OOO in con-
sols and invested the money in her name, found a
school for her at Highgateand with some difficulty
moved her thereto. By ten every Sunday she
was in our chambers to spend the day—-and what
days they were! the musty walls re-echoed with
her laughter, while Ti. and I plunged madman-
like into the sparkling torrent of her love for us
and washed the work away. . h-
“We won’t go to Highgate to night , in, tis
late—let’s settle down, order another bottle anu
think things over.” . „
Ti Junior, carried a large cigar-case with two
brands always there—one a cheap strong-flavoured
we d which he smoked vehemently like an engine
burning cheap coal and anxmus to get rid of the
smoke—this was the stimulant when things
needed thinking over ; ” the other a monopoly at
£5 the liundre I—a slow-burning, fragrant burnt
sacrifice to life when he and it were on good terms,
lie took out two of the cheap ones and passed
mine wi ll “Sauce for the goose, Jack and then
lie lay back and smoked. Not a word was spoken
for an hour while he and I ran up and down the
bright years gone, and peeped tremulously over
the precipices of dark days to come.
I knew Ti. so well that I could read his very
thoughts in his methods of smoking. A fellow-
feeling told me that Flipps played a great part in
his dreamings-he would puff slowly, almost
mechanically, while right away yonder where she
was not —rapidly and becloud his head while about
the time of finding her and then taking his cigar
from Ids mouth Ids hand would fall when face to
face with the tragic necessity of saying UooU-
'JJAbout 11 we rose and wandered home, and stand-
ing on the hearthrug he broke the long silence
“ l)o you think she’ll mind it much, Jack .
“You’re not going?”
“ I shan’t see her witn you away, and then no
dinners, no theatres, no ”——
“ She never loved us for those. ~ „ ,
“ Perhaps not-but I’m off-good night —and
he went but not to sleep, for I heard him pacing
the room half the night.
At five I awoke and crept into Ti.’s room. He
had fallen asleep in the chair ; on the table at bis
side lay six photographs of Flipps, arranged in
the order of their taking. At one end the country
thing that caught our fancy ; at the other the cul-
tured girl who held our hearts. I left a note in
the sitting-room saying I would be home to break-
fast at half-past 10, and then I made for Highgate
and Flipps. ,
Although only 6 o’clock when the cab stopped,
I had no difficulty in getting the girl aroused, and
in half-an-hour we were wandering away together
hand-in hand towards Highgate Woods, and we
sat there with London all below, and silently
watched the threads of smoke rising from chim-
neys, to be caught by unseen hands and woven
into the city’s day-robe of fog. . .
Whatever Ti. may have said as to our mission
in life being one of a magnificent inactivity, the
fact remained that we were merely flotsam and
jetsam on the ocean of our own indulgence and
the girl our only anchorage. What wonder, then,
that this cutting of the painter staggered me
“ Flipps,” I started—the kissing finished— Ji.
says the play’s over and the lights are just gone
out.”
“ What do you mean ?”
I told her all as best I could, and she took the
sorrow of it into the laboratory of her heart to
make tears of, and they (the tears) stood about
her lashes, the morning dew of fateful years to
come. , ,
Poor child, it was her first taste of sorrow, and
she sat beneath the weight of it, her shoulders
bent, her elbows on her knees, her face wedged
down between her hands, staring at London.
Then a smile rippled across the spirit of her
dreams, that came like morning in the fens.
“Of course ! how absurd to foreret I have lots
of money—we’ll take a farm in the country, and
she babbled on of green fields, and the cows coming
home to be milked. . .
Twas best to thank her, and pretend to think
it possible; and so, leaving her trirlhood in the
wood there, we wandered back quite sober, serious
folk, and talked of housekeeping. .
The details of the fortnight that followed tins
interview have been mercifully blotted from my
memory. I left a note for Ti. asking him to take
the whole of the coin with the exception of my
passage-money, and rare of himself, and above a 1
of Flipps. To the girl I wrote a farewell as though
but for a week or two : “ I leave Ti. with you and
in your care. Be both of us to him, for my sake.
I will be back soon for I am going to Australia
where gold is to be had for the picking-up.
* * *
It is two years and I am nearing England
and home again —two years of Australian life in a
policeman’s uniform. Think of it I dare not.
It was all I was fit for, and finding the streets
were not paved with gold I was glad of the
“bil'et.” The days were hideous, but the nights
were not bad. I awoke from my dreamings now
and then to “ run in a drunk ”or r ell a larrikin,
but for the most part I slept the two years
through on the soft, downy b'd of g’onous
memories with Ti. and Flipps hard by. IN or did
Hope ever quite die out. I was in Bourke street
when the cablegram came that called me * ome. 1
knew it was for me before the boy reached me,
and I knew what it said ere I opened it—when 1
liarl read it it was instantly old to me, and the
past two years ancient history.
And so here I am within s’ght of Dover, and
nothing left of those yean but the health of
mind and body got and a certificate of good con-
duct as a member of the Victorian police-force.
# # *
“I don’t know what effect your coming
home will have.”
The girl was speaking.
No not the girl now, for she had never gone
back to Highgate Woods for the youth I saw her
drop. But she was still Flipps, though much
matron! zed. .
We were in a compartment alone running from
Plymouth up to London.
“You see,” she continued, “he never quite
recovered from your going—he grew morbid and
wandered about the old haunts. 'I hen I lost sight
of him for a fortnight—he was in the city always.
One Sunday I found him ; his eye was bright, his
step as elastic as of old ; his youth had come back
with a bound. He laughed and sang with great
gusto, and talked of your return. 1 learnt later
that the day before he had put all the money you
left into some wild speculation, which failed in a
fortnight; then poor Ti. broke down in all
but his appearance. I took what care of
him I could, but he was an old man with-
out hope, and so the months rolled past. Then
the old aunt died, and this money came,
some forty odd thousand, and Ti. wired for you
and grew instantly young again. But here s
London.” ~ ,
We chose a fast horse and rattled away to
Gray’s Inn. The old familiar stairs groaned out
their welcome—the musty smell of the walls was
memory-laden.
The room was ahnost as I left it a bright file
burning-my slippers out, as though I bad been
away but a day—a “small bottle ”on the table, and
by the side of it a bouquet of roses. But Ti. was
not there —I rushed to my own old room and
noticed the steaming water ready for me and
then to Ti.’s room, and there on the bed lay an
old man, withered, wrinkled, and dead for Old
Age bad been before me and put her stamp on my
father’s brow—on the brow of Tithonus, Junior.

Society
Melbourne Evening Standard publishes
ft particularly imbecile story about an old Mother
Hubbard who dreamed that Deeming was “Jack
the Ripper,” and who, presumably, called round
and announced the vision to the editor. We also
had a dream on the same subject, but hitherto we
have refrained from publishing it. We dreamt
that Deeming had acquitted, and all the
newspaper proprietors in Australia had given him
three-fourths of their papers to compromise the
libel damages, and he was editing the S.M.
Herald in person, while “ Mr. James” was
reduced to the position of printer’s devil and his
legs were nearly worn off with rushing up to
Deeming’s room with the proofs. Most of the
new editor’s leading articles were about girls,
generally girls in tights, and he used to
foam at the mouth while writing them; and
ex-editor Curnow, who had handed over all
his property to square an action for criminal libel,
and had been appointed football-reporter, was
nearly dead with horror at the looseness of his
chief’s walk and conversation. ' You couldn’t get
into the editorial room most of the time, because
it was full of the ballet, drinking champagne and
hugging the, new proprietor ; and Deeming had
six wives, who lived on the premises, raising Cain
and keeping dickey-birds ; and there were photos,
of a tresses everywhere, and the staff used to have
insane orgies on the premises at 2 a.m., and a
horrible odour of stale beer and old cigars per-
vaded the whole building. None of the other
papers dared comment on those sinful games,
because Deeming was the principal share-
holder in all of them, and had appointed
some inebriated plumber or gnsfitter as editor,
while the previous owner was reduced to grea 7 ethe
engine in the basement, and was bully-ragged iu
an awful manner by his upstart successor. All the
new editors drank fearfully, and most of them had
epileptic fits, and every one of them was partial to
ballet-girls, and used to “ bl w ” the profits shout-
ing champagne and cigarettes. Every paper in
Australia came out regularly with a leading article
about girls, and the literary staff wore bell-
b Homed pants and torn shirts, and they all wanted
to hug any woman who came in with an advertise-
ment, and there were empty bottles and lock 3 of
yellow hair everywhere. It was a horrible night-
mare, taking it all round, and right at the end of
it we dreamt that we met the proprietors of the
Argus keeping a coffee-stall and the boss of the
Evening Herald selling apples, and David Syme
with his hair sticking out of the top of his hat.
Deeming had refused to compromise with them on
account of the portraits of him which had appeared
in their papers, and had sold them up bodily.

Williams (we call him Williams, because
they have decided to hang the, as yet unconvicted,
prisoner under that name) was a singularly super-
ficial liar even when he lied with a purpose. For
instance, he had a distinct point to make iu
representing himself to the friend of jeweller
Vivian as a sudden inheritor of large properties in
London, but he was a superficial Munchausen to
locate his city premises “next door to Bennett’s,
in Lheapside,” and his “terrace of houses” as
“close to Buckingham Palace.” The first well-
known names that came into his excited mind
were good enough for 'Williams to work upon,
lie was quite capable of swearing that a maiden
aunt had just died and left him Billingsgate
Market in a codicil, or that he had “come into ” a
skating-rink adjoining the Tower of London.
The fact that this natural phenomenon
wooed and won Kate Rounsefell under his true
financial colours has escaped notice. He scarcely
exaggerated his prospects to Kate. He set down
his personal property at <£3oo, and talked modestly
of obtaining a billet anywhere the lady might
suggest. When she suggested W.A., he went
there, obtained his billet, and wrote at once to say
that he was getting a salary of £G a week and
would be able to make .£3 extra, which was
Gospel truth. He pocketed six notes and a
nugget, or two (possibly), per week until the
warrant arrived. Miss R., by the way, has been
misrepresented as a girl xvho thought she had
hooked a millionaire and was readily “ taken in ”
by Williams. The damsel took her mash for
what he was actually worth, in a monetary sense,
at the time. Mad on the subject of womankind
in general, Williams was especially mad on Kate,
and he proved the depth and sincerity of his
lunatic passion by telling her as much plain truth
as possible. Medical theorists will please note.

Melbourne evening papers have started
publishing the customary footballers’ portraits,
and the runners yell out “ Krect portrait of
Deeming!”
Deoming's vanity recalls a story told of
Reuben Keirl, now “doing’’four years in Pent-
ridge prison for forging Sir Archibald Michie’s
name, lie was once addressing a Sunday-school
in Gippsland (Vic.), and in trying to give them a
definition of faith, drew a gold watch from his
pocket, and, holding it up said : “My dear little
children, yon see this beautiful gold watch ;
now, if I were to say that I would give you this
wat h, would you believe me?” “No 1 ” bawled
the youngsters. Replacing the watch, he pro-
duced a gold pencil-case, with a similar resu’t.
Article succeeded article —each of decreasing
ya'ue, and each fai'ing to implant sufficient faith
in Reuben’s generous offer. At last be, got down

the interrogation, “No!” yelled the incredulous
urchins more vociferously than ever. The echo
had scarcely died away when one timid little
fellow, who hadn’t previously spoken, ventured ;
“Yes, sir.” “Ah, my dear children!” said the
relieved Reuben, “this little boy believes me—
that's faith ! ” But he didn’t give that little boy
the threepence.

It will be a nasty rap for the press should
the Judge postpone Deeming’s case tor six months
on the ground that lie cannot at the present time
have a fair trial. It is announced that at the
trial the floor of the Court will be reserved entirely
for witnesses and reporters, and the public will
only be admitted to the galleries. The applica-
tions for seats are already far in excess of the
accommodation. The sensation of the case will
be the production of the fractured skull of the
murdered woman.
Somebody digs up this story about the
Marchioness of Drogheda, who visited Australia
some years ago. Sim was an old lady, short-
sighted, and decorated with shop-teeth and a false
front. It was one of these glaring fronts which
everybody knows to be false, and probably she
didn’t even intend to pass it off as real. One
evening she was dining with a Governor, and
when the soup was passed round, she looked at it
so hard, in the effort to find out what kind of soup
it was, that the front fell off, and dropped into
the plate. Any ordinary woman would have wanted
to flee under the table, or else would have tried to
get her hair out of the soup, and surreptitiously
put it back on her head, but she didn’t even blush.
She only turned the lost adornment over with her
spoon, and then remarked calmly, “Ah, hair soup,
1 see. No, thank you, I won’t have any”—and
after that she placidly sat out the rest of the
dinner in her bald head, and was quite content.

in that city the Congressman isn’t—or wasn't —

The Queen, a paper which ought to know,
states that artificial ears are now having a large
sa’e. They are made of gutta-percha, and are
small, neat, shell-like, and delicately tinted.
Ladies whose natural organs of hearing are large
and coarse, or red and hairy, or are afflicted with
a desire to stand out like the nose of a baby
elephant, conceal these distressing organs by train-
ing masses of hair over them, and fix on the shop
ears so that they just show through the hair.
Then when a lover asks his girl to lend him her ear
she can take it off and lend it to him if she feels so
inclined, and move haughtily away, leaving him in
an utterly flabbergasted state with the severed
member in his hand. But the real trouble in the
business seems to be that a man might want to
kiss his girl when she was flushed with dancing or
running, and if he happened to embrace her upon
the ear, and noticed that it was icy cold while the
rest of her was warm, his suspicions might naturally
be aroused. Unless some scheme can be devised
for heating the artificial ear it is very liable to give
its owner away.

a couple of narrow escapes and a smashed bucket
was the result of the accident; but Mr. Hooligan

led the way he could get 800 hysterical females to
follow him for the purpose of smashing Deeming’s
canary, or flattening out the landlord of the house
at Windsor, or lynching the man who sold the
cement; also he could get them to follow him for
the purpose of getting up a big subscription for all
three just as easily. Also, he could get 800 men to
join in doing either one or the other in exactly the
same way. The great soul of the nation wants

The real reason why

a man doesn’t. A well-

object when she is kneel-

only looks ridiculous. His
legs stick out in an
absurd manner, and he
shows the sobs of his
boots, and the tail of his
coat looks misplaced,
somehow. The only way
to put the two sexes on
an equality is to establish
the fashion of getting

A Melbourne build-

the few whose institu-

so intoxicated with suc-

meeting that he boiled
over into unaccustomed
metaphor. After moving
a vote of thanks to every-
body, and declaring a
dividend, and duly slob-
bering the manager an 1
staff, he declared wildly
that owing to a bitter pill
swallowed when the
storm was at its height
they were weathering the
crisis, and, so far from
being wrecked, their bark
bale fair to breast the
tape of ultimate safety,
because it was founded
on a rock. The meeting
then rose and gave about
13 cheers.
He was an aged shepherd, and deposited
his swag at the' door of the bank in the city,
leaving his faithful dog to guard it. The clerks
smole superciliously as he dived his palsied hand
into a greasy wallet and produced a paper. “This
is a reference, saying you are an excellent shep-
herd, but I can’t cash it, my good man.”_ Taking
it back he produced a cheque, representing many
years’ wages, and took it out in gold. He left,
and the paying-teller tore his hair when he found
out he had cashed a forged cheque.

There is a spectral female who haunts a
certain Melbourne theatre in the capacity of chief
mourner. She is evidently paid by the night to
weep copiously over the sorrows of the harrowed
heroine, and the rag-baby having spasms in the
disguised gin-case, and the hero with the hollow
cough and camel-load of woe, and she spreads her-
self to do her employers justice and lead the
misery. She is a bony character with ringlets,
and weak, watery eyes, and a large red nose, and
she takes up her situation early in the evening,
full of brine. She has also a choice assortment of
sobs aboard—dry, hard sobs, smothered sobs, and
damp sobs. She is used to awaken unimpression-
able audiences to the fact that the actress on the
job simulates unspeakable despair. The pro-
fessional weeper scatters herself judiciously about
the house during the week, so as not to become a
rooted complaint and conspicuous nuisance in any
particular place, and she ranges from the orchestra
stalls to the back seat in the gallery, and has
hysterics everywhere.
The Red Lagoon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Where are you going to camp to-night ?” asked
Mac., thebullocky, as I stopped to have a yarn for
a few minutes, on my road down from the table-
land.
“ I was going to push on to the Red Lagoon ;
there’s good feed there I hear.”
“Hanged if I’d camp there by myself for any
money.”
“ Why ? Are the blacks bad ?”
“No fear, it’s the safest place in the North.
No nigger will come within ten miles of it.”
“ What’s up then ; devil-devil? ’
“So they say, perhaps you’ll see if you camp
there to-night. I had a mate nearly frightened
into the horrors there once. It took nearly a case
of whisky to get him straight again. Well, I
must be moving. So long !”
Mac. straightened his bullocks up and I
resumed my journey.
It was sundown when I got to the Red Lagoon,
so called from a small, reddish weed that covered
its surface. There was beautiful feel there, and
I felt that all the spooks in the world should
not prevent me turning out for the night and
giving my horses a good show. It was dark
before I finished my tea, for the twilights are
short in Spinifex Land ; I had made up a comfort-
able bed of grass and having fixed up everything
snug lay down for a good smoke. It was a moon-
less night and quite calm. Only for the clink of
the hobbles, the tinkle of the bells, and an
occasional snort from my horses there was not a
sound to be heard. One has to camp out alone
night after night in Spinifex Land to thoroughly
appreciate the companionship of a horse. As it
grew a little chilly I made up the fire, made my-

self comfortable under my blankets and went off
into the sleep of the just.
I dreamt that I was fighting alligators at the
mouth of the Albert and that a fearful splashing
was going on ; at least that was the impression
under which I drowsily came to my senses.
The splashing still continued, however, and
came from the lagoon. “ One of the horses has
got in and can’t get out,” was my first thought, and
I jumped up and went in the direction of the
sound. All was still when I reached the bank,
and by the light of the stars the surface appeared
placid and unruffled. Then, for the first time, a
superstitious thrill went through me, but I soon
shook it off, and after listening a little longer I
returned to my camp, renewed the fire, and went
to see if my horses were right. The tinkle of the
bell in the distance guided me to them; and I
foun 1 them feeding greedily and contentedly. I
remained with them during the time I smoke! the
heel of a pipe just to get myself into a proper
“ davlight ” frame of mind, then went back to my
blankets. _ , ,
It was a little while ’ere I went off to sleep, for
an owl gave me a start by suddenly commencing
to bark right over ray bead. However, I did
drop off and dreamt a very strange dream. I
call it a dream, but to me it seemed real enough
at the time.
I was awakened, so I thought, once more by the
splashing, but this time I had somehow no inclina-
tion to inquire into the cause of it. Presently it
ceased, and I heard something come stumbling
towards my camp. Still I felt neither fear nor
any desirq to move. The object came into the
circle of light and squatted by the fin.
It w is an elderly white man, with a remarkably
long, grey beard. He was bare-headed and his
shirt and trousers were wet through and clung to
him. But that was not all. His head and beard
were covered with blood, one eye had been
smashed in, and spear-wounds were visible in his
cheeks and neck. As to his body one could not
tell, but his shirt was blood-soaked and the blood
dripped from his wrists as he held his hands
towards the fire. It was not until I had fully
taken in all these deta’ls and the hideously-gashed
face, with its one eye, looked at me across the fire,
that terror, unreasoning terror, overmastered me.
Then I felt an impulse to yell and jump up, but I
was dumb and powerless. The thing arose and
glaring at me with its single eye, suddenly rang
a furious peal on a horse-bell.
This broke the charm. I started up ;it was
broad daylight, the horses had fed back close to
camp and the one with the bell on was just
giving himself a vigorous shake.
“What’s the yarn about the Red Lagoon?” I
asked Jack Sullivan, the super, of the station,
where I camped the next night.
“Well,” he said. “There is a yarn about it
and a very stupid one, too. Why do you ask,
You camped there last night. See anything ?”
I told him I had been awakened by some
mysterious splashing in the lagoon.
“Fish. Lots of big ones there; always jump
on dark nights. This is the yarn ; some of it, of
course, is true, it's a matter of history. You
know this country was settled early in the sixties
and afterwards abandoned; all the stations
thrown up and the district deserted. This run
was one of them, although the old homestead was
in a different place. There was a deuce of a lot
of “dispersing,” and cattle-killing going on, and
the then manager and some others caught a lot of
blacks, all sorts and sexes, at the Red Lagoon and
made short work of the crowd. The blacks, of
course, took to the water and were most of them
shot in it. Now comes in the embroidery. The
lagoon was said to have been quite clear then and
has since become covered with the led weed that
gives it its name. A natural process I have often
witnessed, where no one has been killed.
“The super., an elderly man, was afterwards
killed by the blacks when camped at the same
place. Some of them have since confessed that
betook to tlie, water and that they hunted him
from side to side until he died. Anyhow it’s true
that he was found half in the water with hie
head and face frightfully battered, and spear
wounds all over. From what I know of them I
should say that he was knocked on the head when
asleep, and that they then chopped him about
and threw his body in the lagoon.”
“ Do the blacks ever camp there now?”
“ No. But that is not singular. They nearly
always shun a place where they have murdered a
white man. I know of many instances.”

trated in a murder case tried in Rockhampton,
(Q.) over 20 years ago before Chief Justice Cockle,

been committed 180 miles west of Rockhampton,
in a building*of which one of the verandah-posts
appeared to be dabbled with blood. Chips were
taken off the posts and exhibited in court by the
intelligent officer, and the medico swore that the
exhibit was stained with human blood. The
accused was convicted on evidence independent of
the gory chips, and confessed to the murder : but
stated with a derisive smile, that the stains on the
verandah-post were caused by bullock’s liver which
he and the murdered man (his mate) used to hang
there for convenience.— Veritas.

the book-keeping of the local Harbour Board —-

Dear Bulletin, — Your recent par. re
“Joe ” Jacobs recalls a meeting I had with him
about the middle of ’BB. First of all—he is the
fourth and'youngest son of old Johnny Jacobs,
who for- years kept the Post-office Hotel in York-
street, Sydney, where now stands the warehouse
of M‘Arthur and Co. Joe was a marvellous
scholar and used to have a cab to carry away his
prizes from the Grammar School. He had the
faculty of being able to recite the contents of a
couple of pages of a book after merely glancing at
them. His success in England was phenomenal
for his age, but—well, a girl came along, he got
married, but as only a single man could hold the
fellowship he had gained a damper was put on his
career. One of the first efforts that brought him
into note in the literary world was a masterly
criticism on Daniel Deronda; then an erudite
work “The Fables of Bidpai ’’—too deep for any
but savants. — Lakomai. .
Electricity, according to Edison, is the
vveapon of the future, and when it is a little
further developed gunpowder and dynamite wifi go
into obscurity, to sit down beside the old flint
arrowhead, and the javelin, and the wooden spear
with the charred point, and similar obsolete con-
trivances. Among other devices he has an idea
for an electric fort, to be garrisoned by, say,
25 men, which, be reckons, will be absolutely
impregnable. When an enemy approaches the
commander will turn on electric currents wlrcli
will radiate in all directions, and command
the country for several miles around. If he turns
them on in full force they will abolish every living
thing within reach—they will sweep off the last
chicken, and grub, and fly, and there will be a
unanimous falling down dead such as has never
before been dreamt of. If he turns them on
gently, he will simply stun everybody, and then
he can go out and confiscate the enemy s arms and
ammunition, and gather up the stunned generals,
and field-marshals, and kings, and ke< p them as
security. In either ease the affair will be so
sudden that nobody will know what struck him.
It won’t be worth while having a big army in
these days, for an army, whether big or small, can
bo wiped out equally well hy turning a handle ;
and it will be no use owning a big, ironclad navy,
for the iron acts as a conductor of electricity, and
the safest thing going will be a wooden canoe. It
won’t even be worth while to be a monarch !hen,
and the individual who has the misfortune to
have been born one will fly into a far country and
lie low.
What People Say.
MISS EVA BROWN, ALBURY, N.S.W.
Writes: “The following’ particulars of my case
are furnished on behalf of the afflict-<l, trusting
they may be the means of restoring others to
health : For eighteen months I was extremely
debilitated, the doctors being of opinion that t
had outgrown my strength. My disease is known
in medical circles as anaemia or poverty of blood.
Pains invaded all parts of my body ; I suffered
from general languor, extreme weakness, listless-
ness, dejection of spirits, indigestion, fickle
appetite, and disturbed sleep. My body presented
a bloodless appearance; my lips were pale and the
ssin like wax. I was under several doct >rs who
prescribed for me; but their treatment did not
alleviate my sickness. I imagined that my con-
stitution was breaking up, and as the disease pro-
gressed I became more nervous and hysterical.
My sufferings were also greatly increased by a
shock to the nervous system received last year,
when a railway carriage in which I was seated
caught fire. When my case was most critical and
gave serious apprehensions to my friends and
myself, I started on a course of Clements Tonic,
which I took, in conjunction with Dr. Fletcher's
pills. The first two bottles effected a great
improvement, and I could relish my food again,
and my general weakness and nervousness vanished
altogether. I took about twelve bottles of
Clements Tonic, and my pale face is now replaced
with the hue of health, and my recovery is as
complete as it was speedy.”
This was a case of general debility, due to
anaemia. Miss Brown gives evidence that must
prove beyond the doubt of the most sceptical that
only Clements Tonic can :.ork such cures and that
the crenuine article must be insisted on when
purchasing.
Backache, stitches in the side, inflation and
soreness of the bowels, are symptoms of a dis-
ordered state of the digestive and assimilative
organs, which can be corrected by the use of
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills.

are so entirely dependent upon the practical

and certainly the importance and the necessity for
pure, suitable, and properly manipulated materials
cannot be overrated.
A ricketty and badly finished article of Furni-

serious harm occurs. But with improperly purified
or badly made BEDDING, how different the tale,
for then you have that which is INJURIOUS

and in many instances just place the order with
whatever wholesale maker offers them the greatest

Nor is this the only disadvantage their customers
suffer, as too frequently the bedding is supplied
by small makers, who have neither adequate
machinery to prepare the materials nor suitable
premises in which to carry on the work. Indeed,
if the purchasers of bedding could only see the
condition and surroundings of some of the makers
of bedding they would not allow the bedding to
come Avithin coo-ee of their backyards, let alone
their bedrooms.

SPORTING- NOTIONS.
£h® V.R.C. Committee have decided to add
±.-000 (as before) to the Champion stages in the event of
the winner covering tlie three miles within s;j minutes,
whereas if the race be reduced to a long preliminary
canter and a sprint at the finish the added money will also
be reduced—to £5OO. But this time limit clause is sub-
ject to extension up to an hour before the race. The
stewards can give a little more grace to the horses if they
have to wade through a quagmire, for instance, but under
fair weather conditions they will need to make a good
s.iow or take the consequences of an all-round “ waiting ”

When Paris was being saddled for the A.J.G.
Doncaster, a gentleman rook a lady up and introduced
her to Brickey Colley, Paris’ jockey, as the holder of
I ans in Tatt.’s sweep. Brickey’s face expanded as he
saw a big “bit” to nothing in prospective, and with a
bland smile lie asked her if she had laid any off to the
owner and trainer. “No,” she replied, “I have never
even seen them. I only wished to he introduced to you
to wish you luck, Mr. Colley, and to tell you that should
you win to he sure to call down and see us.” Brickey’s
smile collapsed, and his face was a picture as he turned to
mount his horse. Fact.

In the Sydney Cup Highborn ran a really good
horse ; his party made no secret, of their opinion that
Strathmore only could beat him. Stromboli’s victory
proved what a fluke the St. Leger was ; for his run up the
straight was one of the best ever seen at Hand wick The

avoided Mitchell, and once, with that view, had a diolo-

Picturesque domesticity has been luridly
focussed in Sydney recently. It is not often
t.mt the limelights of tragedy are thrown upon
a scene like this : A man and his wife lying in
owl.late on in the afternoon, with a second woman
sitting on the corner of the matrimonial couch—-
all three whisky-fuddled. The pair quarrel; the
woman shrieks she “hates” him; suddenly en-
raged, ho whips out a revolver and shoots at the
tern ale, wounding her badly, and then blows out
bis own alcoholized brains, while the attendant
whisky - dazed fairy at the foot of the bed
pierces, the echo-corners with her shrieks. Then
the wounded female numbly lifts her suicided
mate s bead, lets it drop again with a vacuous re-
mark, and totters dreamily downstairs witli blood
spirting from her breast. Men come along and
dress her and take her to the hospital. Alto-
gether, quite a nocturne of erotic tragedy ; its only
lack of com pleteness, from a purely artistic point of
view, being the escape of the woman in contrast
successful suicide of tho male, Archibald
M‘\V ilhams, ex-burglar—and bookmaker. So much
for Surry Hills. Woolloomooloo is proximo acccs-

George Dixon work together, and love each other
as only brothers can, “ fighting like divils for con-

(N.S.W.) makes a little effort on behalf of the
country, by finding in its cemetery a corpse with
a broken neck, with the part adjoining the
snapped vertebra bruised, and with one leg
“deader ” by several days than the other leg. The
police get a clue and a half-caste vvhoknows nothing
about the corpse, and is sorrowfully discharged
from custody because two doctors agree that the
phenomenal appearances are compatible with a
theory that the body had been struck by lightning;
however, a packet of arsenic was also found near
the corpse. Still, thesuspicion that the deceased had
been looted of pelf is a slight thrill to hold on by

THE LAW OF DIVORCE
IS MARRIAGE A FAILURE?
The readiness of some people to bind their live,
together in the silken bonds of matrimony is only
equalled by the readiness of others to discover an
excuse for bursting up those self-same bonds into
fragments so small that a few thousand of them
tied together would be invisible to the naked eye.
A restless spirit is abroad concerning our matri-
monial laws, and a decided inclination for reform
in the direction of providing machinery to render
more easy the dissolution of the marriage tie has
been exhibited in the utterances of not a few o£
our leading public men, “ Is marriage a failure V
is a problem that not one man in ten thousand can
be trusted to give an unprejudiced answer to ; bub
judged in the light of the majority of the excuse 8
put forward as valid grounds for divorce in certain
American States, it would seem as if the correct
reply must be overwhelmingly an affirmative one.
A Chicago man, for instance, in filing a bill of
divorce, mentioned as one of his grievances the
fact that his wife was accustomed to pray aloud
each night before retiring, enumerating all her
husband s sins in detail. It would be quite safe
to hazard the opinion that no New South Welsh-
man will ever seek a decree nisi on a plea of that
kind, or if he does it will only be because he can
lay claim to having annexed for a wife a woman
gifted with volubility of an order somewhat above
the phenomenal. Frivolous, however as are the
reasons frequently advanced by American hus-
bands and wives for seeking a dissolution of
partnership, they are not always so. An aggra-
vated case is reported from Indiana, where a
husband actually retailed strong language in the
presence of his wife and was forgiven, but when
he used her new spring bonnet to feed oats to his
horse, and sealed up her lips with court plaster to.
prevent her from talking, outraged nature rebelled
and she sued him for all she was worth. There is
only one description of divorce that is impossible

The Waterbury Watches are meeting with
genuine approval on all sides. They sell upon
their merits. A discerning public has not been
slow to recognise that they are accurate, con-
venient, stylish in appearance, carefully con-
and with absolutely interchangeable
parts. 1 heir nominal price, too, is bv no means
an unimportant feature. In the series for ladies
great improvements are to be noted, and these
are now turned out of a pattern and finish that
cannot fail to please the most fastidious. A
word of caution, however, is necessary. Don't
be mislead into buying inferior imitations of the-
Waterbury manufactured in Germany or Switzer-
land, and not infrequently exhibited for sale-
ensconced in Waterbury silk-lined boxes, the-
better to deceive the unwary purchaser. Intend-
ing purchasers of the genuine articles should -note-
that every watch manufactured by the Waterbury
Watch Co. has one or both of the following
distinctive marks on the dial, viz. ; The word
Waterbury (in fine type) and the interwoven
letters “ W.W.C.,” without which no watch sold
as a Waterbury is genuine.

The Track of the Dead.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“What's the matter with you; why the deuce
can’t you sleep ?”
“ I don’t know,” returned Alf.; “got a touch of
insomnia to-night. If Idogo to sleep I have the
most awful dreams; all about men I used to
know, men who are dead now.”
“ Oh, for heaven’s sake don’t start such talk at
this time of night. Sit by the fire and smoke
your pipe quietly,” I answered, wearily, as I
turned my back to the blaze and drew my blanket
around me.
“ Right you are, old man,” he replied, good-
naturedly, and I dropped off into unconsciousness.
I awoke with a start. The fire was out, or
nearly so, and the camp was silent. Just above the
horizon the spectral last quarter of the moon
was hanging, tin-owing ghostly, dim, long shadows
around. It was the hour before dawn, the un-
canny hour when all the vital forces are at the
lowest ebb. Some great general is reported to
have said, that the only courage worth a hang was
three o’clock in the morning courage. Whether
anyone ever did make the remark or not, there is
a deal of truth in it.
I roused myself a little and looked around.
Alf. was sleeping on the other side of the fire,
and where he had set his bed down was now in
deep shadow, and I could make nothing out. I
tried to go to sleep again, but it was useless.
Perhaps a smoke might send me off ; so,
seeing a spark still smouldering, I arose, and
blowing the end of a still glowing firestick into
a blaze, I lit my pipe, and then, holding the lighted
stick up, looked over to where my companion
should have been sleeping. His blankets were
tenantless.
May I never experience again such an uncom-
fortable thrill as went through me when I made
this discovery ! I put my hand on the blankets
where they had been thrown aside. They were
cold and the dew had gathered on them ; he must
have been gone some hours. I listened long and
intently, but the night was silent. For a man
to wander away from camp in the middle of the
night, out in the Never-Never spinifex country,
and remain away for hours, is a most uncanny
thing. If he had heard the horses making off
he would have called me ere leaving; if—but I
exhausted all conjectures before daylight dawned.
I could do nothing until then.
The light came very slowly, or so it appeared to
me. We were camped at the foot of a spinifex
rise, on a narrow flat bordering a creek. When
the light was strong I could see the horses feeding
quietly some shoit distance away; and picking up
my bridle I soon had one caught and saddled, and
firing off my rifle two or three times without
eliciting an answering shot, I started to look for my
missing mate. After some trouble I picked up his
track leading straight up the ridge, which, near
the crest, was sandy, and the prints of his footsteps
were clearly defined. The spinifex was scantier
here, and as I gazed intently down 1 saw some-
thing that made me pull up and hastily dismount
to §can the tracks closer. Alf. was not alone,
somebody was walking ahead of him.
Step by step I followed leading my horse, but I
could make nothing of the foremost track, for
Alf.’s almost covered it every time. At last they
diverged, and the two ran side by side. It was a
bright morning, the sun just glinting under the
stunted trees ; what little live nature there was in
that lonely spot was awake and joyously greeting
the day ; but I rose up from my examination of
that awful foot-mai'k with the dew of superstitious
terror on my forehead. No living man had made
that track.
I had to follow on scarce knowing what to think
or expect. I tried to persuade myself that the
foot-print was that of some attenuated old gin,
lean and shrunken as a mummy, but that was
against reason. The track was that of the
skeleton of a man; and Alf. was not following it,
but following whatever was making it.
With varying fortune, now finding, now losing
the trail I kept on for about two hours; then,
halfway down a slight incline, I came upon the
object of my search. He was sitting on the
ground talking to himself, I thought at first, but
when I got closer I saw he was addressing some
object on his lap. He was nursing the head and
shoulders of the remains of a human being. He
lay at full length amidst a patch of rank green
grass fertilised by the decayed body, a skeleton
with fragments of rotten clothing still clinging to
it. Alf had his arm under the skull as one would
support a sick man, and was murmuring words of
affection. He raised his head as I approached
but evinced no surpi’ise. .
“ This is my brother Jack; ”he said. “lanoy
his coming to the camp last night to show me
where he was. We must take him into the nearest
station and bury him. for he can’t rest here, it’s too
lonely.”
I could not answer. Alf.’s mind had evidently
given way and I could not reason with him.
He carried the body back to our camp and I
commenced a ghastly ride to the nearest station
over seventy miles away, with a madman and a
corpse for companions. The third day after
starting we arrived at Ulmalong, then the outside
station, and here I learnt the story of Alf s. twin
brother.
He had been a stockman on the place_ when it
was first settled, and had ridden out on his rounds
one day and never returned. There was little
doubt that tbe skeleton we brought in was his,
but what led the living twin to its resting place ?
I held my tongue about the track for they would
only think I was as mad as poor Alf,
After we buried the remains Alf. relapsed into
almost constant silence. He was quite harmless
and they found him "some light work to do about
the place, but he died, prematurely aged, in about
a year’s time. He was buried with his brother.
A Melbourne constable was sued last week
by a jeweller for .£3O, balance of an account of
£sllos. The items on the bill were : —Diamond

gold watch, £23; gold chain, £9 ; gold locket,
£7; lady’s ring, £4 10s.
The Rajah of Hunza, India, thinks him-
self a most important personage. Every morning
he asks his chief Minister “ Who is the greatest
monarch in the world ? ” receiving tire invariable
answer, “Your Excellency.” It reminds one of
N.S.W. Rajah Parkes amid his numerous Cabinets
of docile and obsequious nonentities.
Dear Bulletin, —Your “circular educa-
tin’’ story chronicles a historical repetition.
Eaily in the seventies, a local celebrity. Darby
Healey, asked Dr. Madden, at Bacchus Marsh,
Vic., “D’yer belave in circular eddication?”
“ No, sir,” replied the doctor, “ I believe irr edu-
cating everybody on the square.” At the same
meeting, a smart man propounded the query :
“Can you tell the electors the difference, if any,
between a mad ’un and a lunatic ?” “ Well,” said
the candidate, suavely, “ the mad ’un answers
questions.”— Crosscut.
Some red-hot people lived about Eulo
(Q.) before the advent of sheep. The mailman
got bucked off his horse, and the prad, with the
mails, took to the bush. He at once re-mounted
and followed the tracks of the bolted mail. He
found it —a pile of smouldering ashes, and the horse
grazing peacefully 100 yards away. The man
who annexed the mail-bags arrived at Nockatunga,
much to everyone’s astonishment—per boot. The
manager was so sorry to see him walking that he
lent him a horse, and sent a blackfellow to pilot
him to the station nearest Sundown.
A sign of the times is that they are
beginning to boil down stock on the Murray.
It is interesting to watch the workmen at
Messrs. Burroughs and Watts, billiard-table man-
ufacturers, at 7 Little George-street, (with the
tools peculiar to the trade) fitting together por-
tions of wood which are acquired for a table m its
embryo state. There are also some really magnifi-
cent tables in walnut, light and dark-stained oak,
mahogany, &c., and one in the course of con-
struction solely of Australian woods— blackwood,
cedar, &c. At the show-rooms in 8 Bond-street,
may be inspected the tables in the billiard-saloon,
three in all, which, from their finish and general
appearance, prove indisputably that tiny are the
work of a master-hand. The stock of cues and
other billiard requisites is immensely large, smaller
than it had been for many year’s. The better
class of cues were named after England’s cham-
pions - Roberts, Cook, Beall, Bennett, Mannock,
Love, Taylor, and others—being fashioned to the
shape, size, and weight favoured by the leviathans.
Areal curioisty, in the shape of a mammoth ivory
tusk (weighing fully 1001 b.) in a statr of decay
estimated to be 10,000 year’s old —is an interesting
spectacle.

Struck It At Last.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was almost blind, and wasted
With the wear of many years ;
He had laboured and had tasted
Bitter troubles, many cares ;
But his laugh was loud and ringing,
And his flag was on the mast—
Every day they heard him singing :
“ Bound to strike it rich at last.”
Here he brandished axe and maul ei'3
Buninyong, and, after that,
Fought and bled with Peter Lalor
And the boys at Ballarat.
East and west and northward, striving,
As the tides set fresh and fast—
Ever trying, rarely thriving—
Yes, he’d strike it rich at last.
Now and then she’d pan out snugly,
Mostly all the other way,
But he never cut up ugly
When he bottomed on the clay ;
Never cursed or got disgusted,
Mourned the days and chances past
Geordie always hoped, and trusted
He would strike it rich at last.
If the days were very dull, or
When the store men cut up rough
And he couldn’t raise a colour
Erom a cart-load of the stuff,
No man found him chicken-hearted,
He’d no time to bang and blast;
Pegged her out again and started —
Bound to strike it rich at lust.
Blinded by a shot in Eighty,
Sinking for the Pegleg Reef,
If he sorrowed o’er his fate, he
Let no mortal see his grief.
In the Home there in the city
Geordie won their favour fast,
All the inmates learned his ditty—
“ Bound to strike it rich at last.”
When brought low, and bowed, and hoarjq
Still his eyes alone were blind,
Lndimmed by fortune was the glory
Of his happy, tranquil mind ;
In his heart a flame was glowing
That defied the roughest blast,
And he sang : “ There is no knowing,
Mates, I’ll strike it rich at last.”
As the end approached he prattl.d
Of old days at Ballarat,
And again the windlass rattled
At Jim Crow and Blanket Flat,
And tlie nurses heard him mutter
As his conquering spirit passed :
“ Streak of luck, boys I On the gutter I”
Geordie’s struck it rich at last.

Queen Victoria smokes ! This is a fearful
strain on our Loyalty. The Tobacco Trade
Journal says so, and mentions the gift of a silver
cigarette-case to H.M. by the frisky Princess
Louise, who certainly does smoke and apparently
makes no secret of it.
At a Victorian election meeting, the other
day, a R.C. priest proposed to question a candi-
date concerning his views as to enforcing the com-
pulsory clauses of the Education Act. “Now,”
said the Holy Father, “if I had a child
but he couldn’t get any further owing to the
hilarious yells of the audience.
The Lilydale Express (Vic.) notes that
it is now a very difficult matter to obtain a mili-
tary commission in Victoria, “ the new regula-
tions making it necessary for a severe examination
as to physical soundness, &c., to be gone through,
and a certificate for immoral (!) character has to
be produced.’’ What a guffaw !
The seven white men in the Bananaland
Assembly who voted against the introduction into

and Sayers. W here was Ryan, the latest labour-
member, on this occasion, please ?
The Australian murder-season seems to
have fairly started. At Shepparton, Vie., on the
11th inst., an old resident named Molamphy slit the
throat of his son-in-law, Meany, who, during a
fit of drink-violence, was choking his wife,
Molamphy ! s daughter. Meany kept a hash-
house. Butchers and restaurant-folk seem to be
indigenous to murderous dramas. Alex. M'Orow
was a butcher, and his wife-victim worked at a
hash-house. At Hemmant, near Brisbane (Q.). a
new-chum arrival named Rudolf Wissmuller, was
found dead the other day, and the evidence points
his skull having been bashed in with a tomahawk, to
after which his pockets were rifled. Frank Hor-
rocks, a Queensland native, aged 19 years, and the
son of a respected Brisbane man, has been arrested
on suspicion, but only possessed 7ld. when cap-'
tured. The murder is timed to have been com-
mitted on the 5th. Horroeks, against whom the
case is as yet by no means clear, comes, on his
mother’s side, of a conspicuously insane family.

It was not originally our intention to exhibit in
Sydney a second time, but we are very glad that
circumstances have afforded us the opportunity to
comply with the general request and desire that
we should do so.
Therefore, where we first landed in Australia,
and opened our season under the most trying,
discouraging, and threatening circumstances ever
confronting any Management, we shall
CONCLUDE OUR GRANDLY POPULAR
and UNIVERSALLY
SATISFACTORY COLONIAL TOUR,
and we trust in a manner equally pleasing to you
and creditable to ourselves.
Crippled, disheartened, and all but overwhelmed
and ostracised by official interference of the most
extraordinary and uncompromising character, our
tremendous and hazardous undertaking might
have been utterly ruined at the very outset but
for the'more than manly and generous sympathy
and substantial recognition .accorded us by the
Sydney Press and Public.
Whatever the intrinsic merits of our exhibition
may have been, the fact remains, and must stand
as the noblest illustration of cosmopolitan spirit
and hospitable principle, that it was less than we
had promised, though all we were able or per-
mitted to present, and that universal and liberal
consideration magnanimously overlooked inevit-
able deficiencies, born of undeserved misfortune,
and said—“ When doubt and darkness beset the
worthy, law-abiding stranger’s wandering feet, he
becomes Australia’s guest and friend.”
We are most deeply grateful to you, both as men
and Americans, and we shall return to our distant
homes bearing such public testimony as we humbly
trust may tend to increase the high estimation in
which you are held across the sea, and mutually
■augment broad and enduring international senti-
ments of good will and respect.
It is but natural and fitting that ,we should
'eagerly avail ourselves of ttie last public oppor-
tunity we shall have to say this much—so much
more than well-deservcd—and as evidence of our
sincerity and gratitude, we beg to announce that
not only will the
HIPPODROME RACES

before lacking be now included
as Fully and Brilliantly as when they recently

extraordinary reduction
in prices will prevail :

Erankly, we cannot hope to make a penny over
?k° ve our Enormous Expenses at such prices.
We do not expect to, and shall be entirely satisfied
n not called upon to face a serious loss. We are
actuated solely by the motive and purpose stated,
and to that end shall spare no effort to delight
? n fyttore than satisfy you, one and all, and leave
oehmd us the recollection of an appreciation
ana performance, which, we trust, will be a
Pleasant memory to you all for many prosperous
years to come.

THE BEALS PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies lias been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work ; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassais, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-wOrk. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops' at any time. Tire Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can bo done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating 1 . —In our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can bo inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

Flower”
Mrs. Sarah M, Black of Seneca,
Mo., during the past two years has
been affected with Neuralgia of the
Head, Stomach and Womb, and
writes: ‘‘ My food did not seem to
.strengthen me at all and my appe-
tite was very variable. My face
was yellow, my head dull, and I had
such pains in my left side. In the
morning when I got up I would
have a flow of mucus in the mouth,
and a bad, bitter taste. Sometimes
my breath became short, and I had
such queer, tumbling, palpitating
sensations around the heart. I ached
all day under the shoulder blades,
in the left side, and down the back
of my limbs. It seemed to be worse
in the wet, cold weather of Winter
and Spring; and whenever the spells
came on, my feet and hands would
turn cold, and I could get no sleep
at all. I tried everywhere, and got
no relief before using August Flower
Then the change came. It has done
me a wonderful deal of good during
the time I have taken it and is work-
ing a complete cure.” t O

Dr. A. w'lLKono Hall, I’h.D., bL.D., F. 5.5.0., &c.
Let it be distinctly understood that this is. no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a wain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst oases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption-
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in,
eluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their caiises, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work uniniveded.
In selling this Pamphlet we arc obliged to re-
require a u Pledge of Honor ” froth those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal iis' Contents outside
of their own families. This is for' Our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery ban be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
The Australian Temperance World saysWe can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. it is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will lie that it secures a clear skin and
speedily docs away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Australian Star says:—“ It is thoroughly purify-

Tales of the Early Days.
No. V.—The Session of Denunciation.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
“The Ring” had been convened. A
■‘session of denunciation” had been called in
the manner provided by the traditional statutes
of the Society, * and Convict Henry Reynell,
“ Colonial ” transport per Coquette, had been
duly apprised that on the Sunday following at
three in the afternoon, he was to be charged with
having violated the “laws.” He, an initiate, had
defied the Ring ; he had told Captain Maconochie
that “he would prove a true man to him ”; and
this after the Ring had ordered that in season and
out of season the new Commandant was to be
thwarted—not so much disobeyed as thwarted.
When, within a month of Maconochie’s arrival,
it had become plain what sort of a man he was,
the “One,” on requisition from the “ Three,” had
convened a “Council of Order,” at which it was
enacted that the new Commandant was an
“enemy.”
The business of a session of “Order” was to
enact “laws” and adopt “regulations.” It was
the least potential of the three descriptions of
Ring gatherings.
The second was that known as the “Session
of Denunciation.” It was convened only when a
formal charge was to be laid against some member
(“initiate” or “uninitiate”) of the society, or
when some person not of the society was to be
denounced for his treatment of a member.
The third was the “Conclave of Doom.” At
this meeting the fiat went forth for punishment,
the executioner was appointed, and —if the doom
was a capital one and the victim a member of the
society—the vacancy would be filled up.
The “Council of Order ” could be attended by
any member of the Ring—whether he belonged to
the initiated twenty-five, or to the uninitiated,
“the novices,” whose number was practically
unlimited. It was invariably held during a meal-
hour, for then only could a large muster be
depended upon.
The “session of denunciation” was attended
by the “circles” only, or as many of them as
could be present. It was usually held on the
nights of Sundays or holy-days, in the Iron
Room. The “circles” were, as a rule, in irons.
“ Clinks” and “Trumpeters” were rather regarded
as “Ring” insignia. Occasionally it was held in
the day-time; Reynell’s was to be a day-session.
As for the “Conclave of Doom,” it was con-
stituted only by the “One” and the “Three.”
If the “ One ” was in gaol, or in such other posi-
tion that his attendance was impossible, then a
majority of the members comprising the circles
of “Three” and “Five” could proceed with
the business. The convening of this culminat-
ing assemblage, however, rested absolutely with
the “One.” The “Three” could not constitute
the Doom-session without his consent; and in
this circumstance consisted the “ One’s ” power of
veto. The twenty-four men constituting the
“circles” might pass a unanimous vote of
“ Death !” or other penalty, and by his simple re-
fusal to convene a Doom-session within the period
indicated by the law and custom of the society—
which period, in Maconoohie’s time, was three
months—the presumed victim would go free.
At the Doom-session, the proceedings were, of
course, controlled by the “One” —the Centre.
At the other sessions, the president was one of
“Three” circle, who acted as leader. The
“One”might be present, or he might not, at a
“Council for Order,”or a “Denunciation;”but, if
present, he would not take charge of the
assemblage. Such a step would have been tanta-
mount to revealing his identity to the “ Ringers ”
generally, and would have been a violation of
the fundamental law of the society, which ordered
that none but the members of the “ Three” should
know who was the “One.” To have torn away
the veil of secrecy which shrouded his personality
would have deprived him of his power. The
Unknown is always terrible.t
From the circle of “Nine” to the circle of
“Seven;” from the circle of “Seven” to the
“Five from the “Five” to the “ Three ;” from
the “ Three ” to the “ One ” : so ran the grooves
of communication.
What, pertaining to the business or the safety
of the “Ring, ” a member of “ Nine” circle heard, it
was demanded from him, by his sworn duty to the
society, that he should communicate to his
colleagues of his “ circle.” And the circle, or a
majority, should decide whether the facts or the
suspicions should be passed on to “ Seven” circle.
Reaching the circle of “ Seven,” the intelligence,
if the circle by majority so decided, would pass to
the “ Five.” In like manner, the “ Fivers” would
transmit it to the “ Three;” and so the “ Centre ”
—the “One”—would hear of it only after long
process of filtration and examination.
At any stage of the routine a “circle” might
send back a “report” for further evidence and
information ; or, by refusing to pass it on, veto
and quash it. The complaint could not be again
made by the lower circle till after the lapse of so
many weeks.
Should a matter be first set in motion by an
intermediate circle, that circle would communicate
the essence of the business to the lower rank, but
the latter had no voice in referring it to the final
judgment of the Centre. All vetoes were similarly
communicated, so that the effect was this : Every
initiate member knew the nature of all business
which by ultimate transmission to “ One” became
the concern of the Ring; but every member had
not a voice in its determination. No initiate could
aid in the settlement of a matter originating in a
higher circle than his own.
The exceptions to this general law were two.
For the denunciation of an initiate member, the
consent of the circle lower than his own was neces-
sary, as well as that of his own and the higher
ranks. Such cases were considered urgent, and
the vote of one member of the lower circle or
circles was regarded as sufficing for the whole of
that denomination. And a “Three,” invested
with scarcely less awfulness than the “One,”
could act independently of his co-“ Threes” by
“ One’s ” authority. It was this latter cir-
cumstance which originated the belief amongst
many uninitiate Ringers that there was no “One.”
They did not necessarily believe that because
the “ Centre ” was invisible, therefore he did not
exist, but they doubted his existence when they
saw that attributes they supposed to attach only
to the dreaded “One” belonged also to the
“ Three.”
Doubts, however, of this kind belonged to the
uninitiates—or novices. The men of the lesser
circles—the Nines and the Sevens and the Fives —
knew o/the “One,” and the Three knew him.
They were sufficient, these degrees of know-
ledge, for they sustained during long years of
maleficent working a dreadful society within an
accursed community—an empire of evil within an
empire of horror. The character of the System
alone did not explain the System. You had to
take into account also the Ring which constantly
battled with the System, and frequently defeated,
though it could not subjugate it.
# * *
It could not subjugate the System, but then
neither could the System destroy it.
The battle was a drawn one : the Ring
ceased to exist as the animating soul of all evil
things on the Island, only when the System
acknowledged itself defeated by the “paralysing
stroke of circumstance ”J and abandoned the spot
which, designed by Heaven as an earthly paradise,
the Englishman had made into a hell. Yet, one
thinks, the result should have been different.
There was the might of England behind the
System —the majesty of her law, the sanctity of her
State religion, the wisdom of her administrators.
On the other side, there were—what ? Twenty-
four felons, and the “ One ! ” A feeble hand-
ful of yellow-and-grey-garbed prisoners, most
of them habitually in irons, scarcely one that
had not shivered as the curling “cat” kissed
him ! Why, the System could have hanged them
all any morning and not been put to the slightest
inconvenience other than doubling the number of
coffin-makers for a week !
Notwithstanding, for 50 years the Ring held its
own. Its heads or “Centres” —the “Ones” —
must have been changed four times at least; the
“circles” were re-organised again and again as
death came along, and touched some “Niner ” or
“Sevener,” or “Fiver” or “ Threer,” on the
shoulder, and gave him his passport of freedom ;
the “uninitiates” were decimated by shootings
and the Battle of the Bloody Bridge, by escapes
and hangings. Still, the Ring lived on. And it
would have been living to-day had the System
survived.
The ceremony of convening had been
gone through, as we say, and the “ Centre ” had
approved of the conclave. So the Threes told the
Fives and the Fives passed the notice on to the
Sevens, and Sevens to the Nines. Each “Niner ”
controlled a body of “ novices,” and to such
of these as, in all likelihood, would be in the
exercise-yards on Sunday afternoon, he “ passed
the word ” for picket and guard duty.
And to one other person was the intimation
conveyed that a Ring session was to be
assembled. The Commandant was so informed —
by a note pushed under his office-door ! Young
though he was in supreme authority, he was at no
loss to understand the significance of the pen-
printed letter:
“We meet on Sabbath next, three in the
AFTERNOON IN THE IRON YARD. YOU ARE INVITED
TO BE PRESENT TO CARRY OUT YOUR THREAT OP
BREAKING US UP.”
It was the boldest challenge to his rule, and
that he should not doubt its authenticity, at the
foot of the missive was stamped (in candle-smoke)
the symbol which formed the official signature of
the “One’’-the four
mg the double-triangle over the broad miow.
* f
Over the broad arrow—that stung Macono-
c|,je as it had stung Wright, Fyans, Anderson,
Ryan and every other Commandant who had been
similarly challenged. For, interpreted, the signa-
ture meant that the Ring was supreme over the
System. Let the System order, it would be for
the Ring to say whether it should be obeyed,
The Commandant consulted the gaoler and such
G f the overseers as he had divined were not quite
enamoured of the old methods of brute-force
which he was seeking to supersede with kindness,
and showed them the message. None could
enlighten him as to what would eventuate at the
meeting. m.
“A Riot. No; that was unlikely,
Ring had other methods of working than o pie-
cipitate an outbreak unless it was pre-
pared, and the, chances were now against any nng
of the kind being contemplated. . ,
“ Shall I stop it. Well, Ins Honor might ly,
but it would be useless. It would take the wlO e
military force of the Island and the armed civ
guard as well, to break up a Ring meeting, an
even then
“What?” They would communicate t ieir
business all the same, and rob everybody o a
night’s rest. . ~
“How?” Because the signalling would go on
the whole night through The night-guards could
hear the signals distinctly from cell to cell ; every
Ringer keeps awake and passes on the signal to
his right or left as the case may be, though he
might not himself understand the significance or
the signal. ,
“But how could the Ring some members ot
which were m the gaol-cells, others in the donm-
tories, others in the iron-room, communicate,
seeing that the three classes of buildings weie
separated by yards ?’ Heaven knows .—and tie
principal Ringers ; nobody else .
“It surprises me !” bo it did eierybody else,
the Gaoler said. , ,
“Do you think, Mr. Gaoler, the Ring would
consent to my making an experiment . lei caps
so; how? .
“If I wished for an illustration of their facility
of communicating, would they grant it?” No
doubt; and laugh in bis Honor’s face while com-
mUnicating. “Would his Honor like to see a
Ringer?” Every officer nearly knew most of the
outside Ringers (the uninitiates)—no secrecy was
maintained as to that class of membership—but
really those fellows knew next to nothing of the
Ring proper. The men who formed the outer
circles were known also; but the actual participa-
tion of each in the working of the society, why,
that could never be proved.
“ Were there many regulations in force against
the Ring ?” Dozens!
“ Any definite attempt at suppression ?” Yes;
an d the Battle of Bloody Bridge was the resnlt.§
The Commandant sickened at the reflection
that here was a force never taken into account by
Right Honourable Secretaries of State and
honourable members of the House of Commons,
or by Judges and Governors. The System might
rule by terror in one direction, and by coarse and
licentious favouritism in another, but here was
a pow'er that defied the tremendous penal organi-
sation created by British justice and British
apathy. Buoyed though he was by his intense
belief in the truth of his theory, and inspired by
his faith in the essential goodness of human

f The theory of the writer as to the personality of the
“One” will be disclosed in a story to follow: “The
Conclave of Doom.” The question of “ One’s” identity
baffled Marcus Clarke, and the writer might, therefore,
have been excused for attempting’ an answer; but he will
venture to propose a solution.

nature, he could not, for the moment, resist the
awful doubt which now assailed him as to whether
it would not- be better to let the System proceed
on its old lines. A power that continued its
machinations under the eye and in the teeth of
Authority, surely the only way to deal with it was
to crush it by force ! These were his thoughts.
Fortunately, however, for his fame, Maconochie
resisted the reaction. When the Lady of Despair,
whose breath fanned him for that instant, had
passed him, he felt it would be at least wise to
wait and see what Sunday would bring forth. He
intended to accept the challenge.

The week were dark but for thy light.
Thy torch doth show the way !
Thus had quoted the Rev. Thomas Taylor in his
sermon at morning chapel to the Protestant
prisoners. His words had been in praise of Sun-
day as a day which relieved for them no less than
for their more fortunate fellows in other places the
labour of the week. Their irons might still clank,
but they did not fret and jar so painfully, for the
movements were those of rest and change and
were not demanded by task-work. Their hands
might still require to describe the salute, but the
obligation would be less frequent. And the free-
dom from labour meant opportunity for reading
and thought for recollection of dear ones far
away—for indulgence of bright hopes for the
future and for something of that intercourse
with their brother-man which, in its unrestricted
and unreprieved fulness, would be tho principal
delight to be conferred by freedom. Something
after this manner spoke the tender-natured
chaplain, whose spirits had been greatly in-
vigorated since the advent of the new 'Com-
mandant.
The chaplain’s words had touched not a few
hearts and had moistened many eyes. Unlike his
predecessor, A , whowasforeverthrowing “The
Prodigal Son ” at their heads ; or Parson Ford, of
Hobart-town, who was chiefly solicitous that his
hearers should prove the value of his teachings by
making a decent ending at the gallows rather
than in reformation of their lives, Chaplain
Taylor invariably impressed the prisoners by
dwelling upon the few bright things of the
present, and the brighter things their earthly
future might still have in store'for them. His
tribute to the Sabbath was oonse ,uently highly
appreciated, and more than one out of
transports in his congregation determined to spend
the rest of the day peacefully—if the Ring would
let them. That contingency had to be faced, for
the knowledge was now general that it was a
“Lodge Sunday.”
The morning muster after chapel passed off
without incident unlike the previous week’s,
when Convict Henry Reynell—the same who was
now accused hy tho Ring—had, at the bidding of
that body, refused to accept, for his comrades of
the Iron-Room, Maconochie’s bribe of tobacco.
And the mid-day meal, of IGoz. roast-meat, 12oz.
baked potatoes, and the extra Sunday relish—to
them who had not been under punishment for the
week —of 4oz. of wheat and barley bread, was
unmarked by a quarrel. When the final “grace”
was said, and the Almighty thanked in mumbling,
parroted parodies for the mercies so amply
showered upon them, the mass of the men in the
yards felt they were, indeed, deserving of the
pleasure which was to be theirs that afternoon.
Not a single prisoner had been felled to the
cobbled floors, and not one had rushed to the
warders with a complaint that his cheek had been
gashed open because he had been indiscreet
enough to object to the theft of his ration. The
peace of the beautiful Sabbath-day brooded, dove-
like, on the resting throngs.
There were five yards, but we are concerned only
with the one on which the Iron-Room opened,
and the adjacent enclosure. These were the plea-
sure-grounds of the aristocracy of crime; and the
Ring membership was most largely represented
in them. A door-way, sometimes closed, but on
Sundays usually left open, furnished a means of
communication between No. 3 yard and the space
devoted to the fettered fraternity. From the
elevated sentry-boxes—the “perches”— at the
corners, armed guards watched or patrolled the
broad-“leafed ” walls. Within the radius of a
biscuit-throw, two sentries of the military main-
guard moved, this one this way, that one the
opposite way, from their post at the entrance of a
passage leading to the gaol.
At two o’clock the sentries were relieved, and a
careful observer might then have seen that a new
interest was taking possession of the throngs in
both yards. Those who were reading closed their
books, talkers became less in earnest, laughers and
jesters—these were not wanting, for some men will
laugh in hell- abated their merriment, and others
who had been nursing their thoughts in abject
solitude, shook off their taciturnity and joined one
or other of the many knots. All, seemingly, began
to count the time.
At a quarter-past two the sentries changed
beats. The movement was noticed by the
prisoners.
Fifteen minutes later, the soldiers rechanged.
The prisoners knew the half-hour had expired.
Without any apparent concord of movement the
men in either yard formed themselves into larger
groups.
By the next change of “ Go,’ ’ talk had nearly
ceased in the two yards. Such laughter and sound
of chat as were borne on the breeze were from the
other enclosures. And the careful observer afore-
said would perceive that now the movements of
the men were taking something of the character of
marching and counter-marching. He would have
heard no word of command ; and yet he should
have understood that some supreme will was giving
directions, for, in the two yards, though no more
than a few men in each could see what was going
on in the other, there was a simultaneity of move-
ment and likeness of manoeuvring.
And by three o’clock, as the guards were re-
adjusting themselves to their original path, the
140 men in the ironed yard, and the 200 in No. 3
were disposed something in this order.
Close to the north wall in the former enclosure
stood two men. At three paces’distance from
them, so placed that, had a cord been passed
through the hands of each to the others a circle
would have been described, of which the first two
men would have formed the centre, stood three
more transports. At five paces from these last,
were another five prisoners. Connect these by a
cord, and these five would have surrounded the
three. At seven paces, again, from the five
transports, were a second five, likewise ranged in
an imaginary circle order. Nine paces away from
this latter five, was gathered a group of 22 or 23
—an outer envelope, as it were, of the inner
rings. The mass of the ironed-men stood by the
South wall—and their faces toivards it; but a
weak line of communication was kept up by a
string of pickets extending to this numerous group
from the outer circle.
Thus was arranged the Ring in day conclave.
The central two men represented the circle of
“Three;” the_three, the circle of “Five;” the
first five, the circle of “ Seven ; ” and the second
five, that of “Nine,” Each circle was separated
from its next lower one by as many paces as there
were members in the lower circle. And the 22
or 23 “ uninitiates ” were divided by nine paces’
distance from the “Nines.” The pickets were
recently admitted “uninitiates.” If the Ring had
a message for the convicts in general or for the
“ uninitiates” who, for purposes of intimidation,
were thrust amongst the transports who had
refused or not been permitted to join the society
it was transmitted by the pickets.
Ihe circles of the Ring, it will be seen, were
short of their proper number. Ib was seldom
possible, indeed, to constitute a full “Ring” at a
day conclave. Of the 24 men making up the
circles, 15 only were in the ironed-yard. Of the
rest, five were at the “mutual responsibility”
farm, and four were in the next—No. 3—yard.
In the latter yard, allowing for the smaller
number of the^ 1 ' Ringers,” the arrangement was
the same. No Threer was included in this
enclosure, but a Five, three Nines, and a dozen
iminitiates were ranged at the proper gradations
of distance. The convicts nnassociated with the
Ring were crowded under the south wall, with
their faces turned from the society group. Between
the twelve uninitiates and the mass stretched,
as in the other yard, a line of pickets.
On the stroke of three o’clock, then, this was the
order of array in both enclosures. Save for a
cough, a clearing of the throat, a friction in the
“irons,” there was no sound among the trans-
ports. The sentries walked to and fro—and
looked to their primings. The armed civil guards
on the perches quickened their senses, but yet
refrained from directly scrutinising the proceed-
ings. They could see every face, and yet no guard
had ever been found who could, on a formal
demand, identify any leader of the Ring. That is
to say, none since Major Anderson’s time. A
warder then had declared to the Commandant he
would swear to a score of the inner circles. And
within a week he lay on his bed, a shattered lump
of carrion. A thirst for information is not always
judicious.
* * *
The soldiers by the gaol-passage exchanged.
And at that instant a sharp, curiously-modulated
whistle shrilled from the Threes in the ironed-
yard, and was instantly answered by another
whistle from the next yard. “ Lodge ” was opened.
A Five broke from his circle, and passed to the
group of uinimtiates. He paused a second before
eich man, who stooped and whispered something
into his ear. Then, from the uninitiates, he
passed successively to the Nines, the Sevens, to
his comrades of the Five, and, finally, to the
Threes. From all he gathered the password save
from the representatives of the innermost circles.
To them he gave it. Daring his progress there
had been countless slightly noisy movements
among the massed transports, yet, the tension of
feeling was so extreme, that many would have
sworn there had occurred no sound except that
cause! by the clink-clank of the irons.
When the Threes received the approving signal,
one—Johnson—began to recite the Ritual; the
other Gooch —to lead off the antiphonal
i espouses. Sometimes both the words of the
leciter and the response were in vigorous,
resonant English; other passages were partly
English and partly in the Ring’s own variety of
the “flash” language; sometimes both were in
the argot. It is unnecessary to say the secrets of
the Ring were conveyed in the last form of
sji'och.
Very solemn the liturgy sounded. If the words
were sometimes ribald, there was nothing ribald
in the manner of their utterance. Except in a
Catholic service, no such respectfulness of tone
and decency of demeanour were ever voluntarily
exhibited by the transports as in a Ring meet-
ing. Any unseemliness was visited with a punish,
ment the more to be feared that its precise measure
was unknown to the culprit till the moment of its
infliction, but the solemnity of its proceedings was
at once the, cause and the effect of the Society’s
influence. Ihe portions of the Ritual which were
recited in the vernacular were resonantly-worded
specifically for the purpose of impressing suchofthe
convicts not enlisted in the strange companionshin
who might be in hearing. Singular though the
statement may appear, it was the religious
character given to its ceremonies that made it the
weapon it was in the service of the devil. Appeals
to occult powers, the element of mystery. in
gesture and language, the measured intonation
the employment of symbolism, the frequent invo-
cation of dread punishment upon men who violated
their oath all were calculated to inspire awe of
cind devotion to tlie Society that used it.
* * *
The temporary leader of the Ring, who
was reciting, reached that passage in the blas-
phemous liturgy ;
Is God an Officer of the establishment ?
And the response came solemnly clear thrice
repeated :
No, God is not an officer of the establishment.
He passed to the next question :
Is the Devil an officer of the establishment?
And received the answer—thrice :
Yes, the Devil is an officer of the establishment.
He continued :
Then do we obey God ?
With clear-cut resonance came the negative—
No, we do not obey God I
He propounded the problem framed by souls that
are not necessarily corrupt :
Then whom do we obey?
And, thrice over, he received for reply the damning
perjury which yet was so true an answer :
The Devil—we obey our Lord the Devil!
In a corner, by the south wall, a youth of twenty
in irons for a freak, dropped his face on his hands’
and stifled a sob. He had been trying since
se.’raon-time to fix indelibly on his memory the
sweet melody of George Herbert’s hymn :
O day most calm, most bright.
The week were dark but for thv light—
Thy torch doth show the way !
and now that music was jostled from his mind by
the demons’ Litany.
Johnson had arrived at the “prayer
Render us, O Satan, always flourishing in thy work
always happy in obeying thy law, thou who art eternal’
who art always 3’oung, who never lackest worshippers and
servants to do thy will, who art always rich, and never
forgettest those who place their offerings at thy altar
when from No. 3 yard came a long, involved
whistle; and in the instant following a murmur
ran along the line of pickets.
Captain Maconochie had accepted the challenge.
* » »
He walked through No. 3 yard unattended.
His predecessor had never entered it on a Sunday
afternoon without an escort of two soldiers. As
he passed he acknowledged pleasantly the few
salutes ho received, and gave no sign that he
noticed the majority of the enclosure’s occupants
declined to recognise his presence. They were
waiting to see what the Ring would do.

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

And the Ring? Save for that murmur of the
pickets the session expressed no consciousness of
the visitor. The rtciter finished the prayer in
'an even tone :
Render unto us the rewards of them who obey thee
always and God never.”!! '
And then suddenly changing his tone from the
kev of religious solemnity to a simple announce-
ment, said “ The Oom’dant! ”
In the same instant he saluted and smiled —
smiled derisively in Captain Maoonochie’s face, as
the latter, appalled at the abominable import of
the Ritual’s words, stood still, showing his distress
very plainly.
“Good heavens, men ! Did I hear aright? Did
I hear you blaspheming your Maker so dread-
fully?”
“Wot, sir?” asked Johnson. “This is the
first degree of a Ring meetin’, y’r know ! We
but say wot we’re tol’ to say. It’s all in the
Ritooal, sir !”
“ You are in Ring Lodge now ?”
“ Yessir ! First degree !”
“ And you blaspheme like this in all your
degrees?” Maconochie stammered and stuttered
in his horror.
“Wud yer like to know, sir?”
“Yes?”
“Then that’s jest w r ot yer won’t get to know
from me, y’r honor !” replied Johnson, and the
retort provoked a roar of laughter, half-timid,
half-defiant, from the Circle. Sunday or no
Sunday the laughers would have been tied to the
triangles by any other Commandant for that out-
rage, but Maconochie, albeit severely tempted,
overlooked the insult.
“When do you hold your other degrees?”
“ In present session, at wunst —unless yer agoin’
to break us up !” Again the fellow laughed.
“ I am not going to break you up to-day- .”
“Nor any other time !” exclaimed the leader.
“’Ear, ’ear!” seconded some “Fives” and
“Sevens.”
# # #
“ Go on with your Ritual!” said the
Commandant, after a pause.
“That’s wot we intend to do, yer honor!’
Johnson, with measured insolence, responded.
“ An’ d’yer mean to stop an’ ’ear us ? ’
“ I do !”
“I ’opes as yer honor ’ll be vastly interested !”
And once more the Commandant was compelled
to listen to a laugh that was a jibe. He let it go
by, like the others.
Then the leader resumed his devil’s business,
and gave, in the next half-hour, the Captain a
lesson as to the ingenuity of felonry that he never
forgot. Better versed than any Penal Com-
mandant, before or since (save Price), in the
“ flash ” slang or thieves’ language, he yet scarcely
comprehended a word of the many concluding parts
of the ceremony brought to his ears.
For, as there were grades in the Ring, there
were varieties in its speech. There was the
variety understood by all novices as well as
initiates —the variety known to “Nines’’and all
above—another familiar to “ Sevens ’and “Fives”
and “Threes”—one in which only the “Fives
and Threes ” were educated. All these forms of
argdt were used that afternoon, accordingly as
the “Three” in charge addressed himself to a
higher circle or a lower.
And, not content with that patent offence to
the Spirit of the System, the Ring perpetrated yet
another. It held communication with its gesture-
language—when a movement of the limbs or head
expressed a number and the number indicated a
word or phrase in its “initiate” code IT—and
in its dumb-talk and its whistling vocabuliry.
These two last were provisions for use when the
legs were ironed and the hands in “bracelets.”
And of all the “talk” and signalling, the Com-
mandant understood next to nothing. All he knew
was that the proceedings shaped themselves some-
thing like those in a court of justice.
There were addresses from the leader “Three”
and his colleagues—slowly and impressively de-
livered ; there were steppings forth from the outer
rings of men who evidently gave testimony of
some sort with right hand uplifted; and there was a
brief and apparently impassioned speech from a
“Seven”—the prisoner’s feelings prompted him
in his excitement to drop into a phrase of plain
English, which he corrected instantly upon being
cheeked by Johnson. And, finally, there was the
pronouncement of a verdict. Amidst a grim
silence, broken only by the shuffling and rubbing
of the second “Three’s” irons as he moved from
rank to rank of the circles to gather the judgment,
the decision was come to. The whole mass by the
north wall heaved a sigh of relief as Johnson
lowered his head to receive the announcement.
By the laws, to condemn a “Nine” a bare
majority of all present sufficed; to “settle” a
Seven, an absolute majority of the Circles present
or absent was necessary; for a “Five” or “Three”
was required a majority of his own circle as well
as the majority of the lower ranks. Proxies were
used for absentees, if the latter knew of the busi-
ness. Reynell was represented by proxy.
Now, of the 15 chief Ringers present in this
Iron Yard but seven voted for Reynell’s condem-
nation. On that vote he would have been dis-
charged of the accusation for it required 13 to
convict him. But, as we have said, five (including
the accused) were at the “ mutual responsibility ”
farm, and four were in Yard No. 3 adjacent to the
Iron Yard. Two out of the five voted, by proxy,
“guilty,” making nine! Would the other four go
the same way?
There was a lull in the “ talk,” and dumb show,
while “ Threer ” Johnson pondered an ingenious—
but quite satanie—notion that came into his head.
He guessed Maconochie would wish for some in-
dication of the Ring’s mysterious power to com-
municate at long distances. That singular capa-
city had irritated and defeated his predecessors,
and naturally he would think with them on that
point, however he might disagree on others.
Johnson communicated his notion to his brother
“Three” in a whisper, and the other applauded
it. Whereupon :
“Wud yer like to see, y’r Honor,” Johnson
questioned very respectfully, “ ’ow we send mes*
sages ?”
“Yes!” cried Maconochie. If he could but
gain some insight into the Ring’s methods he
would defeat them, he thought. “ Yes —yes !”
“Then y’r honor’ll give us yer word as a gen’el-
man that yer won’t use the knowledge yer gain
wi’out formal information on oath from other
parties ?”
The Commandant felt he was justified in saying
he would not.
“Then, sir, there are four Ringers in nox’ yard
—standin’ by this ’ere north wall. I’ll send ’em a
message so you can see ’ow it goes, an’ if yer like,
sir, yer can bring the answer ! ’
Should he do it ? Was it a trap for his dignity?
The Captain reflected, and decided to take the risk.
“ I will bring the answer !”
“Thep, sir, I’m going to send this message!”
Johnson clanked to a foot’s distance from the
Commandant, and lowered his voice: “ Doyervote
as the majority ’ere? The reply, sir, as yer’ll get
’ll convince yer jest that question, and no other’s
gone through. Now, sir, watch !”
The pickets, we have mentioned, stretched from
the cluster of the novices to the south Wall. At a
sharp word from Johnson, they moved, as quickly
as their irons Would permit, to continue the line
to the gate opening into No. 3.
“Now, sir,” went on Johnson, “that there
message is a-goin’ to the end of that line. Yer
follow it from man to man. Then, sir, do you,
please, join this line to the picket inside No. 3.
They will pass the message on, an’ yer’ll get the
reply !”
Anxiously Maconochie watched the procedure.
Johnson, in durnb-talk, “spoke”to a Nine; the
fellow passed the message to a novice or “ unini-
tiate ” by a gesture; he, turning, repeated it in their
slang to a picket. So it went to the line’s end.
Each man, as he received it, revolved on his heel,
and transmitted it to the next, the Commandant
pacing by their side down to the last picket.
Some of these novices trembled because of his
proximity ; others simply grinned; the sentries
and armed civil guards, in their amazement, grew
more positive than ever that the Commandant
was “looney.”
The Commandant —and the message—entered
the next yard. The pickets took it up. Man by
man, with repetitions of slang, passed i t to the group
of uninitiates, and then to the three “Nines.” Then
the solitary “Five” in that yard received it.
Maconochie would have sworn that nothing passed
from man to man save a few syllables of gibberish.
And yet, within a minute, he had been given the
reply.
“Yes, sir!” said the “Five,” saluting, “we
four here votes with the majority !”
* # #
Grieving deeply over this misapplication
of ingenuity, and wondering how he should meet
it and defeat it,-Maconochie walked back to where
the leader of the Ring awaited him in silence at
his proper station.
“ Well, sir ? ” questioned, as deferentially as one
could wish, Johnson.
“ The prisoner said the four would vote ”
“How —how?” came in hard-breathed exclama-
tions from among the circles.
“With the majority!” The Commandant
finished the sentence.
Some laughed at the news ; some laughed at the
exquisitely humorous notion of making the Com-
mandant the bearer of the fatal decision ; and one
man—a “Niner,” a friend of Reynell—said snav-
lingly (to his own hurt at a later time), “ Yer’ve
given Reynell over to his doom ! ”
* * *
Indeed he had done so, though in all
ignorance. How the doom fell we shall tell you
later.
The Chicago Oddfellows’ new hall is to
outdo the Masonic Temple. The design reminds
one of a telesoDpe drawn out in three joints, there
being 34 stories up to the top of the tower, which
is to be 556 feet high, visible GO miles off.
Jupiter and Venus have been almost
occulted of late, which is wonderful, for they are
400 million miles apart, and Jupiter is 1400 times
as big as Venus, though he looks so small. If
really placed alongside, he would be 130 times as
bright.
Dear Bulletin —“Sullivan the murderer,”
referred to in a par in your last issue, met his
death by accident near Wagga some years ago.
I can’t remember exactly how the accident
happened, but I have a distinct recollection that
he was strangled. Perhaps some of your readers
may remember the circumstances.—H. B.
Dear Bulletin, — “ Retributive Justice,”
in your issue of 2nd inst., recalls to me an incident
that happened “ way north ” in N.S.W. sometime
in the early eighties. On a well-known station
belonging to a big Sydney firm, a change of
managers had just taken place, the newly-
appointed man being a person who had driven
Kanakas in Queensland. On the station was a
fifteen-year-old black-boy, Dundile (native name
for frog), who on mail-days used to be sent to
Yargowlahmine, eightmiles distant, for the station-
bags. One day in the dry season, I think of ’81,
he was longer returning with the bags than usual,
whereupon the manager chained him up to a post
and, after giving him a brutal flogging, left him
waterless and foodless, and with streaming back,
to boil and blister under the fearful blaze of a
January sun — stark and bareheaded, tightly
bound hand and foot, with greenhide and dog-
chain cutting deeply into the flesh. For fully 12
hours this unfortunate nigger thus received the
merciful attentions of the flies and mosquitoes.
He never fully recovered the treatment he had
received and died shortly afterwards in the camp.
Months later, we learned from the other blacks the
cause of his delay with the mail. On the track to
Yargowlahminefthereisalargetank; thetimebeing
dry the water in it was low, and the approaches
boggy. Dundile seeing a number of the station
sheep bogged, dismounted to pull them out; his
horse broke away, and could not bo caught for a
long while. Thus, doing his best to serve his
master’s interests, he received the savage punish-
ment I have spoken of. The main actor in this
incident now lives a snug, comfortable life in
the city, but he’ll be drafted into a different
pen when he and poor, ignorant Dundile turn up
at the great muster. —Yours, &c., T.
II Major Anderson showed this version of a Ring prayer
to Dr. Ulliv home, who remarked that it reminded him of
the Orphic hymns.
The numbers could also be indicated by knookinga
on floors or walls ; and a message could thus be carried
along a corridor of locked cells.

A Visit of Condolence: A Study from Life
of a Sydney “ Larrikin.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Does Arvie live hero, old woman?”
“Why?”
“Strike me dead! carn’t yer answer a civil
.jueschin ? ”
“ How dare you talk to me like that ? you young
larrikin. Be off ! or I’ll send for a policeman.”
“ Blarst the cops ! D’yer think I cares for ’em ?
Bur two pins I’d fetch a push an’ smash your ole
shanty about yer ears—y’ole cow ! 1 only arsked
if Arvie lived here! Holy Mosis ! carn’t a feller
arsk a civil queschin ? ”
“What do you want with Arvie? Do you
know him ? ”
“My oath! Don’t he work at Grinder
Brothers ? I only come out of my way to do him
a good turn ; an’ now I’m sorry I come—damned
if I ain’t —to be barracked like this, ’n’ shoved
down my own throat. [Pause.) I want to tell
Arvie that if he don’t come ter work termorrer,
another bloke ’ill collar his job. I wouldn’t like
see a cove collar a cove’s job an’ not tell a bloke
about it. What’s up with Arvie, anyhow ? Is'he
sick ? ”
“Arvie is dead ! ”
“Christ!! (Pause.) Garn! Whatyer-givnus ?
Tell Arvie Bill Anderson wants-ter see him.”
“My God! havn’t I got enough trouble with-
out a young wretch like you coining to torment
me? For God’s sake go away and leave mo alone!
I’m telling you the truth, my poor boy died of in-
fluenza last night.”
“My oath !! ”
The ragged young rip gave a long, low whistle,
glanced up and down Jones’ Alley, spat out some
tobacco-juice, and said ;
“Swelp me Gofd ! I’m sorry, mum. I didn’t
know. How was Ito know you wasn’t havin’
me?”
He withdrew one hand from his pocket and
scratched the back of his head, tilting his hat as
far forward as it had previously been to the rear,
and just then the dilapidated side of his right
boot attracted his attention. He turned the foot
on one side and squinted at the sole; then he
raised the foot to his left knee, caught the ankle
in a very dirty hand, and regarded the sole-
leather critically, as though calculating how long
it would last. After which he spat desperately at
the pavement and said :
“Kin I see him ?”
He followed her up the crooked little staircase
with an “ who’s-afraid ” kind of swagger, but he
took his hat off on entering the room.
He glanced round the room and seemed to take
stock of the signs of poverty —so familiar to his
class—and then directed his gaze to where the
body lay on the sofa with its pauper coffin already
by its side. He looked at the coffin with the
critical eye of a tradesman, then he looked at
Arvie, and then at the coffin again, as if calcu-
lating whether the body would fit.
The mother uncovered the white, pinched face
of the dead boy, and Bill oame and stood by the
sofa. He carelessly drew his right hand from his
pocket and laid the palm on Arvie’s ice-cold fore-
head.
“ Poor little cove !” Bill muttered, half to him-
self ; and then, as though ashamed of his weak-
ness, he said :
“There wasn’t no post-mortem, was there?”
“No,” she answered, “a doctor saw him the
day before —there was no post-mortem.”
“ I thought there wasn’t none,” said Bill,
“because a man that's been post-mortemed always
looks as if he’d been hurt. My father looked right
enough at first, just as if he was restin’—the only
time he ever rested in his life —but, after they’d
had him opened, he looked as if he’d been hurt.
No one else could see it, but I could. How old
was Arvie ?”
“ Eleven.”
“ I’m twelve —goin’ on for thirteen. ’Arvie’s
father’s dead, aint he?”
“Yes.”
.“ So’s mine. Died at his work, didn’t he?”
“Yes.”
“ So’d mine. ’Arvie told me his father died of
something with his heart!”
“Yes.”
“So’d mine; aint it rum? You scrub offices
an’ wash, don’t yer?”
“ Yes.”
“So duz my mother. You find it pretty hard
to get a livin’, don’t yer, these times ?”
“My God, yes ! God only knows what I’ll do
now my poor boy’s gone. I generally get up at
half-past five to scrub out some offices, and when
that’s done I’ve got to start my day’s work,
washing. And then I find it hard to make both
ends meet.”
“So duz my mother. I suppose you took on
bad when yer husband was brought home?”
“ Ah, my God ! Yes. I’ll never forget it till
my dying day. My poor husband had been out
of work for weeks, and he only got the job two
days before he died. I suppose it gave your
mother a great shock?”
“My oath! One of the fellows that carried
father home said: ‘Yer husband’s dead, mum,’
he says; ‘he dropped off all of a suddint,’ and
mother said. ‘My God ! my God !’ just like that,
and went off.”
“Poor soul! poor soul! And—now my Arvie’s
gone. Whatever will me and the children do?
Whatever will Ido ? Whatever will Ido ? My
God ! I wish I was under the turf.”
“Cheer up, mum!” said Bill. “It’s no use
frettin’ over what’s done.”
He wiped some tobacco-juice off his lips with
the back of his hand, and regarded the stains
reflectively for a minute or so. Then he looked at
Arvie again.
“ You should a’ tried cod liver oil,” said Bill.
“ No. He needed rest and plenty of good food.”
“ He wasn’t very strong.”
“No, he was not, poor boy.”
“ I thought he wasn’t. They treated him bad
at Grinder Bros.; they didn’t give him a show to
learn nothing ; kept him at the same work all the
time, and he didn’t have cheek enough to
arsk the boss for a rise, lost he’d be sacked.
He couldn’t fight, an’ the boys used to tease him ;
they’d wait outside the shop to have a lark with
j-Aryie. I’d like to see ’em do it to me. He
couldn’t fite ; but then, of course, he wasn’t strong.
They don’t bother me while I’m strong enough to
heave a rock; but then, of course, it wasn’t
Arvie’s fault. I s’poso ho had pluck enough, if
he hadn’t the strength.” And Bill regarded the
corpse with a fatherly and lenient eye.
“ My God !” she cried, “if I’d known this, I’d
sooner have starved than have my poor boy’s life
tormented out of him in such a place. He never
complained. My poor, brave-hearted child ! He
never complained ! Poor little Arvie ! poor little
Arvie!”
“ He never told yer ?”
“ No—never a word.”
“My oath ! You don’t say so ! Prap’s he
didn’t want to let you know he couldn’t hold his
own ; but that wasn’t his fault, I s’pose. Y’see,
he wasn’t strong.”
An old print hanging over the bed attracted his
attention, and he regarded it with critical interest
for a while:
“ We’ve got a pickcher like that at home. We
lived in Jones’ Alley onest—in that house over
there. How d’yer like livin’ in Jones’ Alley ?”
“I don’t like it at all. I don’t like having to
bring my children up where there are so many
bad houses; but I can’t afford to go somewhere
else and pay higher rent.”
“ Well, there is a good many night-shops round
here. But then,” he added, reflectively, “you’ll
find them everywheres. An’, besides, the kids git
sharp, an’ pick up a good deal in a alley like this;
’twont do ’em no harm; it’s no use kids bein’
green if they wanter get on in a city. You aint
been in Sydney all yer life, have yer?”
“No. We came from the bush, about five
years ago. _ My poor husband thought he could
do better in the city. I was brought up in the
bush,”
i “ I thought yer was. Well, men are sich fools.
I m thinking about gittin’ a billet up-country,
myself, soon. Where’s he goin’ter be buried ?”
“ At Rookwood, to-morrow ?”
“ I carn’t kum. I’ve gotter work. Is the Go-
vermint goin’ to bury him ? ”
“ Yes.”
u -Bjll l°°ked at the body with increased respect.
Km Ido anythin’ for you. Now, don’t be
frightened to arsk!”
“ No. Thank you very much, all the same.”
“Well, I must be goin’; thank yer fur yer
trouble, mum.”
“No trouble, my boy—mind the step.”
“It is gone. I’ll bring a piece of board round
some night and mend it for you, if you like; I’m
learnin’ the carpenterin’, I kin nearly make a door,
lell yer what, I’ll send the old woman round to-
night to fix up Arvie and lend yer a hand.”
“ No, thank you. I suppose your mother’s got
work and trouble enough ; I’ll manage.”
“I’ll send her round, anyway ; she’s a bit rough,
but she’s got a soft gizzard; an’ there’s nothin’
she enjoys better than fixin’ up a body. Good-
bye, mum.”
“Good-bye, my child.”
He paused at the door, and said ;
“I’m sorry, mum. Swelp me God ! I’m sorry.
S’long, an’ thank yer.”
An awe-stricken child stood on the step, staring
at Bill with great brimming eyes. He patted the
child on the head and said :
“ Keep yer pecker up, young ’un ! ”

Alexander M‘Crow, sentenced to death
for the Blackfriars (Sydney) murder, is, we
believe, the first person in any British community
who when capitally arraigned has given evidence
on his behalf.
All would-be assassins should steer clear of
anything bearing the title of “Hen and Chickens.”
Wainwright, the London murderer, hired an
empty pub. called the Hen and Chickens wherein
to hide the remains of murdered Harriet Lane,
and Australia’s own Nicholls and Lester deposited
a body in Hen and Chickens Bay, Parramatta
River. All three murderers fell and broke their

THEY SANG ON THE SHIP’S DECK.
“Home, homo, sweet, sweet home;
Be it ever so humble there’s no place like home.”
Blessed be the memory of John Howard Payne
for writing this song. Who doesn’t know it?
Who hasn’t sung it? Full of hope, full of heart-
break, its melody has girdled the globe. In July,
1891, a large party of Cornish people sat on the
deck of the good ship City of Paris, bound from
New York to Liverpool. They were coming on a
visit home-after long absence. And as the ship
ploughed the calm waters, they sang “Home,
Sweet Home.” But a gale came on, and for two
days most of them had other matters to occupy
their attention; they were too seasick to sing.
Then the Welsh coast was in sight, and they sang
once more, louder than ever. And so it goes on
everywhere-T-illness and trouble spoil the music.
“ My wife never knew what it teas to he v:clh ”
Thus writes a husband, and here’s the rest of his
letter. “She always felt tired and languid,” he
says, “and never got enough rest. She had a
dreadful bad taste in the mouth, with a sinking,
gnawing feeling at her chest, and her food seemed
to do her no good. She had also a dry hacking
cough which people said was a “ Churchyard
Cough.” She went as thin as a shadow and had
to alter her clothes and make them smaller. Now
better and now worse she went on suffering
like this for ten years, and took all kinds of
medicines, cod liver oil among the rest. She saw
several doctors who sounded her chest and asked
if any of her relatives had died of consumption,
leaving the impression on her mind that she was
consumptive herself. Now as her mother had
died of consumption she felt sure she was going
into a decline. Three years ago I was much con-
cerned about her. She had sick headache all the
time, pain in the sides and legs, and used often to
faint, and got so weak I had to take her in my
arms and lift her in and out of bed. People asked
what was the matter with her, but she could
scarcely describe her condition, for it was an alb
gone feeling, making her fit to drop down. Even
going upstairs would exhaust her and make her
feel faint.
In November, 1883, a book was left at the
house, in which my wife read of a case exactly like
hers, and she exclaimed : “That is just my com-
plaint, and as it has been cured by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup perhaps my ailment is not consumption
after all.”
“I got the Syrup and she found relief from the
first bottle, and soon grew quite strong. The
hacking cough left her and she now enjoys her
food. I consider that a bottle of Seigel’s Syrup is
Worth more than a week at the seaside, Before
taking this medicine my wife’s life was a misery
to her. You are at liberty to publish this state-
ment if you desire to do so.”

This is another instance Of indigestion and
dyspepsia being mistaken for consufnptiom ,Fortu-
nately the little book referred to, revealed the
error in time to enable Mrs. Smith to treat her-
self for her real disease and bring about a quick
recovery. But cases with a less happy ending
constantly occur. We would again impress the
fact upon the public that consumption, rheu-
matism, gout, bronchitis, kidney complaint, and
nearly all affections of the throat, lungs, and
nerves are virtually symptoms of indigestion and
dyspepsia, fob the reason that they are catised by
a poison in the blood directly resulting ffbtn fi
torpid state of the stomach, liver, and bowels.
Therefore, however strongly the indications seem
to point towards one of those so-called diseases,
your true course is to take Seigel’ Syrup, which
removes the radical difficulty which lies at the
bottom Of nearly all . physical suffering, viz.
Indigestioh ahd dyspepsia.
Who has not sometimes said, “ Oh, I liaVe shell
h headache—l Cali scarcely see ?” What makes
the head ache ? Well, the disordered nerves, of
course. And what throws the nerves oUt of
order ? Let us see.
“For fifteen years,” says Mr. W. D. Evans, of
Brynawel, Mount Pleasant, Swansea, “ I had
beel) a gteat silifeter troth indigestioh and
HathlChcy. I had a bad taste ill tlife inohfcll, with
pain arid distress aftet eating, rnjr bowels
became much swollen. I felt languid and out of
spirits, and had great pain across the temples,
which at times was so severe I could scarcely see.
I saw several doctors who were unable to give me
more than temporary relief. In December, 1890,
I told a friend of mine, Mr. W. Lloyd. Rising Sun
Hotel, Morriston, how bad I was, and he advised
me to try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup. After
taking two bottles all the pain and oppression left
me, and I never felt so well in my life as I have
done since. I eat my meals with relish, and feel
light and comfortable afterwards. This remedy
has worked a iniraole on me. It is a blessing to
mankind.”
