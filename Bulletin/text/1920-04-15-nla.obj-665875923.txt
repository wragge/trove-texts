This Week’s Toilet Hints
THE LATEST AND SMARTEST BEAUTY RECIPES COLLECTED
FROM VARIOUS EXPERT BEAUTY WRITERS.
A “BLACKHEAD” SECRET.
An instantaneous remedy for blackheads,
. oily skin, and enlarged pores.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly
corrected by a unique new process. A tablet
of stymol is dropped in a tumbler of hot
water, which will then of, course “fizz”
briskly. When the effervescence has subsided
the face is bathed with the styinol-charged
water and then dried with a towel. The
offending blackheads, of, their own accord,
come right off on the towel, the large oily
pores immediately contract and efface
themselves naturally. There is no squeezing,
forcing or any drastic action. The skin is
left uninjured, smooth, soft and cool. A few
such treatments should be taken at inter-
vals of three or four days thereafter in
order to ensure the permanence of the pleas-
ing result so quickly obtained. Stymol tablets
are obtainable from your chemist in
original packages.
GREY HAIR—HOME REMEDY,
An old-fashioned home-made recipe restores
youthful appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But,
on the other hand, there is no reason why
you should have grey hair if you do not
want it. To turn the hair back to a natural
color is really a very simple matter. One
has only to get from the chemist two ounces
of concentrate of tammalite and mix it with
thr§e ounces of bay rum. Apply to the hair
with a small sponge for a few nights and
the greyness will gradually disappear. This
liquid is not sticky or greasy and does not
injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the for-
mula,
TO KILL ROOTS OF SUPERFLUOUS
HAIR.
“Home Science.”
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair-roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered plieminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is de-
signed not only to instantly remove the hair,
but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of plieminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient,
THE REAL CAUSE OF MOST BAH
COMPLEXIONS.
“Health and Beauty.”
It is an accepted fact that no truly
beautiful complexion ever came out of jars
and bottles, and the* longer one uses cos-
metics the worse the complexion becomes.
Skin, to be healthy, must breathe. It also
must expel, through the pores, its share of
the body's effete material! Creams and
powders clog the pores, interfering both
with elimination and breathing. If more
women understood this there would be fewer
self-ruined complexions. If they would use
ordinary mercolised wax instead of cos-
metics they would have natural, healthy
complexions.
ABOUT HAIR TONICS.
“Noyel Recipes.”
Each week almost one hears of some
wonderful discovery for improving the hair,,
and although this paragraph may seem a
little c uperfluous, an old-fashioned recipe
may come as a welcome change. One thing
about it is that it will grow hair, and also
prevent it falling out. From your chemist
get an original package of boranium, to this'
add 1-pint of bay rum, allow it to stand
30 minutes, then add sufficient water to
make half-a-pint. Rub briskly into the
scalp with the finger-tips, and you will im-
mediately experience that clean tingling
sensation ,which is a sure sign of healthy
action. ” [ f

AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Euinen-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food,' thus all owing the natural digestive ferments to act,
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumentliql
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Coming Race
The Russian, in the mass, w T as -never
accused of fierce or indiscriminate washing,
and the national death-rate was always
high. Probably the ruthless extirpation of
the better-washed class in the Bolshevik
war has reduced the already-low wash aver-
age ; anyhow, sti>ange tales are told about
epidemics and omitted funerals and insects
and crawly things and mixed horrors. A
Yankee lady recently wrote from Omsk
(Siberia) about the passing of train-loads of
neglected typhus patients (as many as 35
cars of closely-packed typhus in a train),
with rare animals on them that would have
gladdened the heart of an entomologist. They
were coming from Europe and meandering
east to drop their cargoes (unburied, for
the trains didn’t carry undertakers) as near
as possible to Koltckak’s army, and the Jap-
anese, and incidentally Australia. It is said
that the armies of Petlura and Denikin
really crumpled up through disease, they not
having great populations to draw upon for
reinforcements. Petlura’s force especially
divided into three principal sections —(1)
the dead, “(2) the sick, and (3) the panic-
stricken and more or less infected who were
still on their legs and heading wildly for
Poland, Galicia and Roumania, carrying
germs with them. A peculiarity of typhus-
stricken camps is their billions of lice, and
a wave or surf of these parasites is said to
be moving west. It is all probable enough
and is merely a return to the ways of three
or four centuries ago, save that there were
no trains then for people to flee in.
The mass of the Russians hadn’t so far
to go back as the nations west of them to
reach the year 1620 or 1520. Reading the
story even of Renaissance days, which were
cleaner than the days of the - saints and
the Old Masters, one often comes across a-
mention that some promising invasion, cam-
paign, siege or butchery in Gennany or Italy
flickered away like a candle through disease,
“breaking out in the camp.” That simply
meant that the army lay down and died in
a heap, because there was lack of nursing,
medical and surgical science, drains, hospi-
tals, disinfectants, cleanliness and decent
burial. The camp cat that washed itself
with its tongue was the best sanitary appli-
ance around, but it couldn’t lick the whole
army with .its tongue.' This sort of thing
happened to Sennacherib, the potentate whom
the poem was penned about, but it was com-
mon much later. Charles VIII., though he
got no poem, lost one chance of an Italian
crown because, in the flush of success, his
force uttered a loud groan and a
hiccup, and most of it was no more.
In the Thirty Years (Undrained) War, the
population of Germany went down on a wild
guess from 30,000,000 to 4,000,000 (some say
8,000,000), and even cities that dodged battle
and siege became mere shadows of their old
selves. The world only began to accumu-
late population in l’eal earnest—that is to
say, man only began to be a rabbit and
woman a rabbitess in real earnest —about
120 years ago through improvements in
medical science and sanitation. In earlier
times nations would simply drop through a
hole and disappear, though strangers
generally came into the land and were known
by the old name. With a return to the old
conditions the same thing may happen again,
lice and all.
A quaint idea is that some time , or other,
when man has fallen through on a very
large scale and is stunned by the unaccus-
tomed di’op, some smaller but highly-intelli-
gent and prolific and enormously-persistent
animal may develop a soul and take posses-
sion. The 'spider seems most likely to fill
the bill and be man’s successor. It is brainy,
prolific, apparently indestructible, and in its
big, venomous varieties it has a powerful
fighting force. The lizard class bossed the
earth, so far as w<* can guess from geology,
•for a long, long time, though the records of
their scaly commonwealth have been lost.
Their 4ob was taken over by the mammal-
first the bisr illiterate mammal, and then its
relation or descendant the smaller book-
writing or publishing mammal. The turn of
the insects hasn’t come yet. but as the
sceptre steadily passes from huge ci’eatures
to diminutive creatures, it probably will come
when opportunity serves. Possibly Bol-
shevik wars and Bolshevik pestilences may
supply the opportunity, and the spider seems
the most probable insect to make xxse of it.
Agur, the son of Jakeli, had suspicions aboxxt
the spider as far back as the 30th chapter of
Proverbs, and remarked on its ambitions and
foreshadowing habit of dwelling in kings’
palaces. It stays there long after the mon-
arehs are gone.
Some light would be thrown on the futui’e
if we could discover these things about the
past:—•
(1) What silly political or other convulsion among
the lizards dragged them down from their place of
power and gave the big, flattish illiterate mammals
their chance.
(2) What muddle in affairs made them succumb
to the small, perpendicular publishing mammals.
(3) If the folk of the old doomed race reajised
any more than we" do to-day that other and quite
unconsidered creatures had an eye on them and were
waiting their turn.
The marvellous increase of insect life when
man is in low circumstances may mean some-
thing.
JANES EDMOND.
Rupert Brooke
Francis Brien (Red, Page 4/3/’2O) repeats
the fable of Brooke’s “great personal
beauty.” It is time that libel died. Even
according to English standards I don’t think
he could be considered beautiful—if such
be a decent word to hurl at any man. Cer-
tainly by any Australian gauge fie would*be
neither beautiful nor handsome; not even
handsomely ugly. I met him in Tahiti in
early 1914 and saw a good deal of him. He
was living round the coast at Mataiea, but
frequently came in to Papeete, where he
used to put up at the Hotel Tiare. I was
•staying there too. This was not so much
coincidence as the fact tljat it is practically
the only hotel in the township. My first
eight of him was one evening at dinner on
the delightful wide verandah which in that
favonian climate serves as dining-room.
Brooke strolled in with a dame who
was honoring the Tiare with her pres-
ence. Evidently they were seeing life.
At any rate, they were each chewing
a piece of sugarcane as they came
in, and they to do so while
waiting for one of the Clunky waiters, or
Tatamata of the liquid, eyes, to arrive with
the sc-ran. A new face, other than when a
steamer was in port, was such an event that
I took a good look at the youth—he was only
2| years younger than myself, but he seemed
a mere youth. I decided that he was a good,
fresh, f.a.q. sample of an English public-school
boy doing a regulation tour at the expense
of an indulgent dad. He was wearing a tiare
blossom behind his ear, native fashion, and
his shirt collar was open in that ostenta-
tious way which declares an intention to be
free and easy even though the bally universe
should explode. From Brooke’s appearance
I decided he was probably conceited. His
nose suggested that. The profile photo by
Sherril Schell in the “1914” volume of his
poems shows the effect clearly. The line
from the point of the nose to the junction of
that promontory with the lip, instead of cut-
ting straight in, sloped at an angle of nearly
4odegrees, giving a distinct effect of tilt —-
and conceit —especially to anyone accus-
tomed to long Australian probosces. Then
the eyes, rather small, were somewhat close
together, marring slightly their attractiveness,
the eyebrows not well defined, complexion
fair, hair ditto. His height a little above
English average. Place him among a crowd
of Diggers and he would appear not quite
insignificant, but verging that way—lacking
distinction, say.
I have always regretted that, because of
his friendship with another English youth
who had bored me badly, I, tried to keep
clear of Brooke. They were so pally that I
felt sure he would be of the same brand.
Possibly I was one of the Australians he
refers to in his letters as “not knowing
whether they despise most the haw-haw Eng-
glishman or the damn niggers, and haying
neither the grace of the former nor the
charm of the latter,” or words to that effect.
Only I didn’t despise the damn niggers.
Tahitians are not the type a man despises.
Later, when circumstance threw me into
Brooke’s company, with some others, for all
a long evening—waiting for a boat to sail—
I found that I had misjudged him. He was
pleasant, unassuming, and rather quiet. Of
course I should have a collection of the
brilliancies he uttered, but I can’t remember
a single word. If he scattei’ed any pearls
that night they were cast before swine, so
far as I was concerned. All this callous
vivisection is because it annoys me to hear
a chap, who could write what he Wrote,
labelled and libelled as “beautiful,” and I’m
sure he will be much more annoyed, than I
was, if his ghost reads Francis Brien.
As a final kick, isn’t it time we started
praising such genuinely beautiful things as
the sonnet commencing “These hearts were
woven” in preference to the much-boosted
“If I should die,” which, after all, is sheer
suburbanism. Because of that quality it is
much lauded in the suburb of the British
Empire to which it specially refers. But there
is no reason for us, parrot-fashion, to repeat
the. cackle. If Brooke, wandering in the
fields of asphodhell, should find in some
bookshop an asbestos copy of “If I should
die” he will probably give an indulgent smile
and remark: “After all, it really was a bit
provincial.”
BARTLETT ADANSON.
Thinking in Other Languages
In taking me to task for saying that I
know men who not only speak Maori but
think. Maori, too, “Wabini-nui” (Red Page,
11/3/’2O) splits hairs with an axe.
“Wahini-nui” holds that a man of one
race cannot think in the language of an-
other race. Now, I have just left an English-
man, a visitor to Maoriland, who thinks in
Punjabi. For 30 years he has been in the
Indian Civil Service, all the time in the
Punjabi backblocks. At one time for a whole
year he spoke English only with an effort,
though he could write it more easily, as his
official reports had to be sent in in that
language. He tells me that even now he
always thinks in Punjabi and afterwards
translates into his mother-tongue. Let me
add that when he told me this he had not
heard of this discussion. To take another
instance, in his book, “When Blood is Their
Argument,” Ford Max Hueffer, a German
with some English blood in his veins, wrote:
“I have never had any feeling of. foreign-
ness in France. For as long as I can
remember I have been accustomed to think
indifferently in French, German or English.
....Whenever I have thought with great
care of a prose paragraph, I have framed it
in my mind in French, or more rarely in
Latin, and have then translated into
English.”
Unless men like Elsdon Best and Alfred
Grace can exercise a similar faculty in
regard to Maori thought and viewpoint, I
don’t see how they can understand and trans-
late the Maori myths. The sense which
enables this to be done is the “mytho-poetic,”
and it seems to be an instinct which
is developed by training in the proper
environment. Some Anglo-Saxons who have
this gift can project their mentality into the
thought-atmosphere of Egypt, some into that
of China, others that of India, and others
that of Polynesia; and possibly yet more
arenas are entered by men with other
thought-sympathies. This faculty has been
a powerful factor in Britain’s colonisation
work. It follows that the men who steep
themselves in the thought-streams of other
races acquire .some of the characteristics of
the races with which they come into such
close mental relations. Yet they retain the
original line of thought too. And though
the presumption may be all against such
physical feats, and the psychological facts in
opposition to such fundamental inversions
of type as I imagine myself familiar with,
let me assure “Wahini-nui” that these things
are as stated. I admit, of course, that it
“would be wildly absurd to allege that Rtipr-
gins” (of to-day) might “think like Paul of
Tarsus,” but it is only the time-factor which
makes me do so.

For Constipation
Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been
expelled from the body are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettea, the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do ; and
they do not wear out in their effects.
Taken according to directions they
assist the patient so that the use of
an opening medicine is not a con-
stant necessity.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Green Hedges.
Green hedges, green hedges! The plough-
furrow shines,
Around the grey gateway the dark ivy-
twines, • .
The crooked white ash has black buds in
the spring—
Oh, greenly the grain grows!
Is it April and rainbows?
Sure, the bird of my heart has a small song
to sing!
Green hedges, green hedges ! But here there
are none
Where fifty-nine hills lie asleep in the sun ;
And the grey line of fence takes no mea-
sure of miles —
Oh, the day walks in yellow!
Each tree’s a good fellow,
With a headful of dreams and a heartful
of smiles.
Green hedges, green hedges, and little square
crops,
And little round hills with grey walls on
their tops;
And mosses, old mosses that cling to brown
boles —
It’s far, far to walk there,
But dreams will still talk there
To men with round hills and small fields in
their souls.
Green hedges, green hedges, you creep at
your will
Up the long yellow slope of the fifty-ninth
hill!
And here’s the grey gateway where all the
roads meet —
Oh, the half-acre wildwood !
Brown paths of my childhood,
You hardly have room for my dreams and
my feet.
Green hedges, green hedges, the mirth of
the trees
Is light on ten miles full of sunshine and
breeze!
Was it there, was it here that my spirit was
born ?
Nay, how can I tell you?
Laugh, breeze, while I sell you
Two sprigs of gold wattle and three of green
thorn!
Green hedges, green hedges! The bush is
so green !
The fairest white maiden that ever was seen
Laughs all into dimples—God bless her
pink feet!
Is it April and rainbows?
Oh, greenly the grain grows;
And the harvest of dreams is where all the
roads meet!

Song.
Sweet was the dream, dear, ,
We two dreamed together.
When Robin sang in the furze bush
In the kind, grey weather.
Flush of red on the brown briar,
Flame o’ the falling year.
And Love beside the heart’s fire,
My dear ! My dear !
We dream all alone, dear.
Of whin-gold and heather,
And a wee moon above us
Like a grey goose-feather.
Berries burn in the brown brake,
Sang Robin ne’er so clear,
For a song’s sake, for a dream’s sake,
My dear ! My dear !
VICTORIA.
CYPRIAN STARR.
The Blue Mountains.
Like a veil from a painting lifted the white
fog flows away,
Like a ghost of the night that flies from
the golden onset of day,
And scarred and shattered and riven, and
cleft by the sword of Time,
Emerge in the light of morning the hollows
and heights sublime.
The hand of the night had filled the valley
from rim to rim
With mist, as a maid might fill a bowl
with snow to the brim ;
But the rule of the night is over, and the
whole deep valley wakes
As a song that from silence gushes, as
light from the darkness breaks;
And the bowl full of misted silver, as full
as a bowl could hold.
Is brimmed to the upland margin with the
sunshine’s splendid gold.

New Moon.
Stampeding all the fleecy flocks
Came wandering the milk-white ox,
In meadows of forget-me-not,
By planet lane and rainbow plot,
Across the Common of the sky
Towards cloud hedges, blurred and high;
To sink at last upon his knees
Behind the climbing mountain trees,
Believing he was hidden there.
But I could see, erect and fair.
Among God’s golden guarded corn,
A delicate and silver horn.
You told me that it was the moon
Dropped from the arch of afternoon
Slipping the misty mazes through.
It may have been the moon to you.
But I know better! In the night
I hear him passing, cool and white.
Smelling of fields of angels’ clover.
Ranging the ways of Heaven over;'
And I guessed by that guilty horn
That be was stealing starry corn '

or. in other words, of applying our energies so efficiently that we can get through
twice the work we used to do in any given time with half the fatigue.
If our manufacturers are to reap the full benefit of the new tariff, anything
that tends to increase production should be snapped up with avidity. Australian
Producers—and that in the final analysis means every Australian man and woman
—must realise that to hold their own in this new world of “after war" they must
have the best equipment and tools available for the industrial and commercial
contest of coming years.
No matter what you have decided to manufacture, YOU MUST HAVE THE
NECESSARY ADVICE in the selection of plant, equipping of same, and instruc-
tions in the efficient handling after installation.
Consider what this means. The plant produces work immediatelv on modern

THE REPUBLIC OF JOSH BILLINGS.
Possibly the League of Nations muddle will
pass over, leaving no special traces or re-
sults behind it. (in the other hand, it may
be marked by historians, a hundred or a
few hundred years hence, as the point at
which the ineptitude, of that gl-jointed and
sudden confederacy called the United States
became apparent, and people ceased to be-
lieve in Uncle Sam as a swift and even
moderately efficient political force. It took
nearly three years for his Circumlocution
Office to lumber into the war, and now the
mammoth requires so much space to turn in
that he hasn’t the ghost of an idea how to
get out of it. He remains at war with all
the old belligerents because the patent peace-
making apparatus is rusted. If the Ger-
man attack had been aimed at Washington
instead of Paris, it looks as if the eastern
States might have been occupied before the
Military Department had got its boots on.
The U.S. has never been hurried in war
affairs except when the British took Wash-
ington in 1814. Even in the Civil War
secession began in December, 1860, and fight-
ing commenced with a mere handful of men
in July, 1861. That was quite different
from the Franco-Hun disturbance, in which
war opened on August 3, and the first big
siege began on the 7th and the first huge
battle was fought on the 22nd. Even with
nearly three years to prepare it was a very
inefficient and unready Uncle who ultimately
got into the field. At the Peace Conference
the U.S. hung up matters for months with
its wonderful scheme of a League of Nations,
and up to now it is the only Power of im-
portance, barring enemies, which hasn’t
joined the League. In other words, every-
body is dwelling in its house except itself.
It claims to have built the mansion and it
sits on the fence and in the rain outside
while there is revelry within. It was the
only State which declared itself paralysed
because its autocrat was .sick and more or
less out of his mind, as its Constitution made
no provision for any sort of regency. And
nobody could improvise anything. A special
feature of the case was that it demanded
that the “self-determination” of peoples
should be specially provided for. Even if
colored peoples don’t count this was awk-
ward for a republic which holds eleven of
its own Atlantic States by pure conquest,
despite their most furious protests, and
which acquired many islands by the same
off-hand methods. Then the Monroe Doc-
trine, by which the U.S. assumes a
sort of guardianship and fatherly dic-
tatorship over the whole continent, was
recognised by the League of Nations agree-
ment, which was a triumph for the big
Union. But the Union having dropped the
agreement the recognition is abandoned or
suspended, and meanwhile the big South
American States are joining the League and
throwing in their fortunes with the Allied
Powers of Europe, and thus breaking the
connection with the Old Man at Washing-
ton, who has spiked his own gun and has
nothing to reply with.
In the general Josh BiLLiNos-ness of
things a serious proposal has been made that
the Union should get out of the pit of con-
fusion, without rejecting or accepting either
the Peace or the League of Nations, by
simply repealing the war declaration of 1917.
It is a pity that the scheme seems to have
missed fire. It would be a spectacle of
mirth to see a nation putting back the clock,
disqualifying the war, though the pension
and other bills might refuse to be disquali-
fied, raising the dead if they would rise,
wiping out the fact that it ever heard of a
Peace Conference, and putting an official ex-
tinguisher on history. Lenin and Trotsky
made a futile attempt to end their troubles
by declaring that Russia was “out of the
war.” To declare that the U.S. had never
been in it would be an improvement.
* *• * #
One result of all this confusicm is a great
access of disrespect for Uncle Sam as a
capable business man and a successful doer
of things. He may be a great manufacturer
and trader and dealer and jobber, and his
Waltham Pills and his Huckleberry Piano
may keep their place in the market, but his
first irruption into world politics has shaken
faith in his versatility otherwise. The
obvious way in which his politics were driven
hither and thither bv the German vote and
the Irish vote and the Russian vote and the
Italian vote and almost everything foreign
except the Abyssinian vote has also reduced
the popular conception of his capacity for
assimilating strange races. His reputation
for logic and his reputation for being master
in his own house has suffered, moreover,
through that resolution passed by the Senate
in favor of self-determination for Ireland.
It was illogical on the part of a country
which has never given its own eleven
secession States the self-determination that
they asked for in 1860-61, and on the part
of a Legislature which has refused to sign its
own much-advertised contention providing
for the self-determination of peoples in a
general way, and has specifically declared
that it won’t pledge itself to lift a hand
either to free ensalved races or to prevent
races already free being enslaved. Among
all the peoples, large and small, which op-
posed the Hun the United States is the only
one which, having broken away from the
pact, can’t say things like that without being
ridiculous. All these happenings, including
this truckling, purely by wprd of mouth, to
the Irish vote, is likely to increase the pro-
found disrespect of the South —a South that
is mainly of French, Spanish and old Eng-
lish origin—for the wisdom of the North,
which has elected all the Presidents since
1849. The census of 1910 showed over
12,000,000 strangers-by-birth who were
neither English, Scottish nor Welsh, and
the number of unassimilated or im-
perfectly assimilated progeny of strangers
may have been another 12,000,000—-or
32,000,000 for that matter. They are almost
all in the part of the country which supplies
the Presidents—the re-conquered secession
States being out of the game—and to a very
considerable extent they elect the Presidents.
These hordes did marvels at enriching the
U.S. in the days when machinery counted
for less and mere brawn for more than it
does now, for they practically all went
through a long stage of ignorance and cheap
servitude. Now they are getting out of that
cheap-labor stage and into the governing
stage. The States where the old races have
fairly well preserved their purity had a very
low opinion of the wisdom of their diverse
rulers even when they were less diverse and
less foreign and less Bolshevik than they
are now. The comic-opera doings of the
last few months certainly haven’t heightened
that opinion. They tend to create a feeling
that, politically, the ruling section of the
countrv is like the brontosaurus—large and
stupid and of various colors. Also they tend
to create a feeling that the Union is really as
disunited below the surface as the British
Isles, and can hsy/e its tail pulled with im-
punty if an expert does the pulling.
ANOTHER INJUSTICE TO ALCOHOL.
An Australian archbishop inquired the other
day, with that simplicity which is permitted
fp clerics and Judges: “Is it not true that
venereal disease is caused by alcohol?” The
idea is so general that drink has a great deal
to do with the dissemination of V.D., even
if it isn’t entirely responsible, that some
figures recently published by the Medical
Records Section of the U.S. Surgeon-Gen-
eral’s office are of great value. All that
the Yankee military authorities were con-
cerned about in respect of those men newly
drafted into the mobilisation camps was the
information necessary for the filling up of
their nominal rolls; the question the M.O.’s
asked about a recruit was: “Is he diseased,
and if so in what town or State did 'he
become diseased?” A result of their com-
bined investigations was to supply the Y.D.
percentages for almost every big town in
the U.S.A. By comparing the V.D. inci-
dence of those soldiers who came into camp
from wet and dry areas respectively some
idea may be got of the relation which alco-
hol bears to this great affliction. The pro-
hibitionists draw first blood. The city which
sent out the smallest proportion of diseased
recruits f 2.03) was Cambridge (Mass.),
and Cambridge was a local-option centre.
On the other hand it is practically a suburb
of Boston, which was a city of saloons before
the U.S. went dry. The next dozen big
towns, ranging from Paterson (2.13) to
Hartford (2.63), were wet —-some of them,
such as San Francisco (2.50) and
Jersey City (2.56), very wet indeed.
Denver’s percentage of V.D. cases was
2.71, Portland’s 2.96 and Salt Lake
City’s 3.10; and all of them were prohibition.
Kansas, the capital of a leading prohibi-
tion State of the Union, had the consider-
able percentage of 6.51. And, finally, the
very worst percentages were provided by
four prohibition towns- —Dallas (14.30),
Houston (17.16), Birmingham (18.57) and
Fort Worth (18.67).
The prohibition States showed up no bet-
ter than the no-license towns; and disease
was as rife in the innocent country as it
was in the wicked cities. In many cases
more so. The cleanest State of the 52 was
Vermont, with a percentage of 1.30. It
was wet, and with 47.5 p.c. of the popula-
tion living in towns. Massachusetts (wet),
with 92.8 of its inhabitants living in towns,
had a 2.31 percentage as against Maine’s
2.35; and Maine had been a prohibition State
longer than any other in America, and had
but 51.7 p.c. of its people living in towns.
The Southern States were mostly dry, and
they provided such appalling figures -as
Texas, 11.02; Louisiana, 11.21; South Caro-
lina, 12.66; and Florida, 15.63. In these
States 75 p.c. of the inhabitants were coun-
try-dwellers.
What deductions can fairly be drawn from
such facts? In the first place it is probable
that a large proportion of the sort of men
who acquire venereal diseases would obtain
liquor even in the dry States. Only, instead
of being reasonably good, it would be vil-
lainously bad. Pure liquor may produce
hopeless drunkenness and fatal consequences;
but bad liquor must. The difference between
the degree of irresponsibility achieved by one
who has imbibed matured spirits or beer,
and another whose refreshment has been im-
provised, a night or so previously, out of
potato-peelings, represents the difference,
broadly, between the dry State drinker’s
chances of acquiring V.D. during a “burst”
and those of the more collected reveller in
one of the wet States. But drink has little
bearing on the question, anyhow. Prohibi-
tion is a state of mind. And its tendency
is to extend to everything. It may be
possible to get results of a sort from the
prohibition of cigarettes and gambling, but
the ruling out of the procreative instinct is
another matter. As the righteous persons
who control the liberties of their fellows in
the typical prohibition areas are unable to
successfully inhibit prostitution and other
forms of irregular intercourse between the
sexes, their tendency is to ignore them.
If they can’t do away with loose
living altogether they will shut their eyes
not only to its existence but also to its
results. The registration of prostitutes is
condemned as State encouragement of sin.
The sale or free issue of prophylactics is
opposed because it “makes vice safe.” Notifica-
tion is “an unjustifiable interference with the
liberty of the subject for the benefit of the
incontinent.” In Victoria during 1910 and
1911 the State Government officially investi-
gated the V.D. problem. Shortly afterwards
the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of
Public Health drew up an elaborate scheme
for grappling with it. Before getting to
work it sent details of its proposals to 800
ministers of religion in the State. Only 60
condescended to reply at all; and. to quote
Dr. James Barrett, “the majority disap-
proved, whilst a few were simnly abusive.”
It is mediawalists such as these who have
the biggest legislative pull in the typical
prohibition area or town. Cities like New
York and San Francisco are not remark-
able for virtue. They are seaports; and
seaports are always open to disease. And
till the beginning of this year these two
cities were as wet as any place in the world.
On the other hand, their saloons operated
under continual supervision; their prosti-
tution problem has been supervised for
years; the majority of the inhabitants know
something of the dangers of promiscuity;
and there is a doctor or a drug store in
every street. Result: San Francisco’s V.D.
percentage was as low as 2.50, and New
York’s 2.63.

There was no prohibition in the A.I.F.
except on transports. Drink was at all
times easy to get both in and out of tho
line. In Egypt the Esbekieli Soldiers’ Club
and many;, more institutions of the sort were
open; the Y.M.C.A. issued sheaves of warn-
ings ; the padres of all denominations
exhorted and the M.O.’s threatened. Between
January and May, 1916, there were 10,000
cases of V.D. in the A.I.F. The drinking
continued, but the Cairo Purification Com-
mittee got to work. Its three main activi-
ties were the supervision of prostitutes, the
provision of ablution rooms and the free
supply of prophylactics. Within a very few
months the infections were reduced by nearly
one-half. In Paris during the war there
was unlimited alcohol to be had by those
with the money to pay for it. The normal
strict supervision of the streets and so forth
was necessarily relaxed. In August-Sep-
tember, 1917, 5000 British troops visited
Paris and over a thousand of them became
diseased. In October-November, 1918,
another 5000 arrived. Amongst the Anzacs
—who formed a large proportion—there
were three infections: amongst the British
42. “Blue-light” depots had been formed
in the interval; and the Australian depots
happened to be better served than the
British. In other words. A r enereal disease
derives primarily not from liquor but from
laxity. If it were possible to destroy all
the alcoholic drink in the world and to debar
people from making any more, there is no
reason to believe that there would be any
less V.D. But if the liquor remained un-
assailed. except that its quality was super-
vised, while certain drastic measures recently
suggested in England by Sir Frederick
Treves, Sir William Lister and other
eminent doctors, were taken —-in that event
even syphilis itself might be as successfully-
attacked as the plague has been.
WAR TO THE BOTTLE NECK.
Three weeks ago from Brisbane to the Tweed
the country was little more than soil, dry
to dust, and brown grass sapless as dead
hair. Now with the rains it is a green and
gracious garden from Taringa to beyond
Corinda and as far south as I went this
journey—lndooroopilly green to the river ;
Corinda to the Kuraby, crops from horizon
to horizon, the growing almost to be seen in
the act; rich grassy fiats by the Logan and
the Albert; water everywhere, full rivers,
quiet billabongs, and creeks snaking through
the grasses.
With an excellently agreeable party that run
on the South Coast railroad, which ends at the
N. S. Wales border as it should not, was a
memorable joy-ride in a reprieved world,
through pasture that never failed even in
the drought, because this region is drought-
proof. This is a great banana country
until the coast is approached near Coolan-
gatta ; and from there cars took us over a
tributary of the Tweed, up the heights of
Barney Point, its cultivation hiding the mere
heaps of basaltic rubble which are the
banana fields, the torn bannerets of the
groves threshing in the wind. Seaward is
Point Danger and the white horses of the
Pacific racing the easterly and whipping the
stallions of the sea to shore. Then
Chindera and south of it Cudgen. white on
its green hill, and so by 13 miles of road
along the shining river: the sprawling hills
brilliantly green in the .sunlight; dairy cattle
still poor, not having recovered as quickly
as the grass; the rises hip and flank new-
washed in rain and dressed in green; two
blows of granite pushing through the basaltic
valley; Palm Island and its crowded groves
of bungalow palm; the hibiscus wondrously
scarlet to eyes used to their blooms oil
poorer soil, and red as if they had been
reblooded by the rains; Condong Mill in its
.silent season ; fields of maize, sugar, arrow-
root and banana; Mt. Waring snubnosed
and alleged to be like the profile of Henry
Parkes ; the steel-blues and blacks and
purples of the broken sierras of the Divid-
ing Range; and then Murwillumbah and a
pleasant town in a green and pleasant land.
Murwillumbah is persistent in its natural
desire for railway extension to its natural
port of Brisbane, and its fight against Syd-
ney centralisation is old enough to be re-
spectable. It is the railhead of a line
that goes south-east to Byron Bay, thence
a little south of west to Casino, thence south
to Grafton, thence south-east to Coff’s Har-
bor. From Coff’s Harbor the N. S. Wales
North Coast line is not operable to Kemp-
sey, where there is another railhead, which
at Taree sweeps westerly so that there shall
be no chance of anybody discovering Port
Stephens; thence southerly to Maitland and
easterly to Newcastle; and thence southerly
to the bottleneck of Sydney the Cormorant';
Sydney the Dog-in-the-manger; Sydney with
400,000 more people than it should have,
while Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are as
they are.
The old days of sailing-ships, days when
land transport was difficult in the tremendous
territory of the Australian States, produced
the centralising curse which has made trans-
port more difficult and costly. The work-
ing classes of Sydney are to-day paying
unnecessarily high prices for food, partly
because centralisation has succeeded in form-
ing a city artificially great in population, so
that food has to be hauled unnecessarily long
distances. The size of Sydney in relation
to the State’s population has few admirers
beyond land-agents, real-estate speculators,
and the impossible Freetrade people who
made Sydney a great wharf for the import
of shoddy and the export of “our great
natural industries,” including the dirt in
greasy wool. All N. S. Wales is paving
tribute to the bottleneck of Redfern: the
southern Riverina and all the country south
of Goulburn should be making to Jervis Bay;
the freight of the extreme southern Riverina
should be making to Melbourne or, rather, to
Western Port. The alleged port at the
end of the drainage area of the Yarra is
almost as costly to Victoria as Sydney is to
N. S. Wales; and Melbourne, even from the
most selfish viewpoint of the vested interests
of Victoria, is a place that invites a chal-
lenge and a beating from the best port of all
for the big ships that are coming—Hobart,
destined to be a very great industrial centre
because of its naturally deep waters and its
cheap and plentiful hydro-electric power.
Queensland has the least centralisation of all
the States, mostly because there was no strong
faction in Brisbane like that of Sydney—no
powerful Freetrade gang to preach that all
the Northern State must send its pumpkin
to Roma-street. Thus it got four trunk
railways or the beginning of them —north
and south and south-west lines into Bris-
bane ; a central-west line into Rockhampton:
a northern-west into Townsville; and from
Cairns a north-west line and branches.
Alternating these ports are small lines run-
ning to smaller and more difficult water, at
Maryborough, Bundaberg and Mackay, and
the North Coast railway with half a dozen
other places of shipment. Centralisation
has touched Queensland little except as re-
gards the natural harbor of Port Curtis,
whose development by railway's has been
opposed by the artificial, costly' and inefficient
ports of Maryborough and Rockhampton.
So the shocking example of centralisation
remains with N. S. Wales; and at Murwil-
lumbah you can understand this agitation
for the new' State. TheSe Northern N. S.
W r ales separatists aim at a triangular State
from Point Danger westerly to Goodooga.
thence south-easterly by Walgett, Coona-
barabran and Merriwa to Lake Macquarie,
just .south of Newcastle. The new State
would have an area of 65,000 square miles
and a population of 460,000. leaving N. S.
Wales with 241?,000 square miles and a popu-
lation of 1,540,000. Tasmania has 26,215
square miles and 208,837 population:
Queensland 670,500 square miles and 694,090.
The Northern N. S. Wales Stare, as nro-
posed, w'ould be a little bigger than Victoria,
and have a greater population than Queens-
land had at its separation in 1859; it would


be able at once to handle the many cioss-
country railways, and the water conserx ation
and hydro-electric schemes that now go to
"‘recommendation” and no further. It could
have an inland capital at its centre, and a
consequently fair radiation of conservative
energy. Every man knows that the stupid
administration of the Northern Territory and
of Rabaul is largely owing to the distance
from the Central Government —that the Com-
monwealth Government in Melbourne has
little but theoretical control outside of Mel-
bourne. The new State would mean »the
beginning of the end of a ridiculous railway
system—roundabout routes of hundreds of
unnecessary miles to drag every ton of
freight and every passenger through the
bottleneck of Redfern.
Where the proposition of the triangular
State as described errs is that it would take
all New England and leave the low-rainfall
back-country still where it is. Any new
coastal State must take on' its job of help-
ing the back-country. Apart from that
there are no objections that are vital and
few that are reasonable. The machinery
offers difficulties. The N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment must consent to separation, under
existing Federal law, and that seems hope-
less to expect yet awhile. But the real Aus-
tralian is not tied to the bottleneck of Red-
fern, and the separatists will in good time
have their right and proper way.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Truly Orthodox Vegetable.
“The serious reduction in the area sown to wheat
during the past four years and the almost com-
plete failure of last season’s crop make it imperative
that immediate steps be taken to place the industry
on a more satisfactory and permanent basis. Few
townsmen grasp the fact that the average amount
so far paid on last year’s wheat crop is less than £ 1
per acre on the limited area cut for grain, while
more than one-third of the total area sown was
either a complete failure or was so poor a growth
that it was fed off. In the previous year the average
price paid for the crop harvested was only about
335. per acre, and in each case dockages were made
for under-quality wheat. It is obvious that these
amounts were much below the bare cost of produc-
tion.... Correspondents have recently drawn attention
to the necessity for a guaranteed minimum price for
wheat for three or five years.... Some form of
arrangement whereby the price of wheat during a
time of shortage such as that of the past two years
more closely approximates to the actual cost of
production.... would appear inevitable until normal
times return.” — Portion of scream from Sydney
morning paper.
“Employees of the Australian Jam Co. have re-
ceived notice that their services will not be required
till farther notice, owing to the inability of the
works to continue in operation with sugar at the
recently increased price. About 600 hands are
affected. Other jam manufacturing works are be-
lieved to be in a similar position.”— -Published. in
Sydney morning payer without any scream, and as
a mere item of news.
A question should really be asked in some
House or other whether the growing of
wheat is a religion. Will a man go to
Heaven simply because he grows wheat? Is
he bound to finish up in perdition if he
doesn’t grow wheat? And is growing wheat
a touchstone of loyalty, patriotism and good
citizenship? If none of these things are so.
then it is a mere matter of business to be
considered without flag-flapping, impassioned
eloquence and foaming at the mouth, and
these are points to be considered :
(1) Australia, even in misfortunate times, grows
enough wheat for its own consumption. It doesn’t
want more wheat at present except for export, and
that means selling at the world’s price less cost of
carriage by foreign profiteers’ ships.
(2) In other words, Australia doesn’t want any
more wheat at present except as a gambling counter
in a very poor gamble.
(3) On the other hand, it plainly wants for its
own use, and without any gamble, more sugar, hops,
coffee, cotton, flax (its imports of cotton and linen
goods sometimes eat up the whole value of the wheat
crop), silk, clothing of all sorts, machinery of all
sorts, manufactured food of a thousand sorts, and
sundries past counting.
(4) Wheat-growing beyond the country’s bare
necessities has been Australia’s, record failure. The
enterprise has beep propped up with cheap land,
roads for which the farmer wasn’t and couldn’t be
taxed, railway freights which cover less than half
the cost of carriage, advances in bad times which
are too many times, and there is now also a
guarantee of a minimum price. And with it all
wheat, grown with the export trade in view, is
a hard-work and long-hour industry which, when
the periodical and reliable and inevitable bad year
comes round, pays no wages at all. Taken all
round, there has been only one Australian crop since
1913 that has paid anything like union wages. And
it is no good waiting “until normal times return,”
for these times are normal.
Wheat is respectable, traditional, orthodox
and_ strictly English; jt is patriotic because
it is English, and it is the correct thing
and the proper caper. Beet-sugar, on the
other hand, though it pays better and there
is a huge local demand, was originally a
French idea; and tobacco isn’t English, nor
is cotton, for John Bull’s climate doesn’t
suit them. As for manufactured goods, they
are all right if produced under Freetrade.
for Freetrade is English, but they
are accursed otherwise. Freetrade may
not suit the Australian climate any
more than wheat does save in a
few favored spots, but orthodoxy is hard to
kill. So the Sydney Daily Shoddygrapii
lashes itself into fury, after the manner of
the fitful, foaming dervish, demanding un-
limited support for our exotic vegetable
which has already had more support than
all other vegetables put together; which has
lost more' ground than all other vegetables
put together after being artificially
shoved on to a pinnacle; which has
of late been paying no wages at
all in the Ma State; and for which there
is really no burry, for now that it has
found a sort of natural level there is still
enough of it to meet local demands. It has
had a more patient trial and a longer run
than anything else, and now that its limita-
tions have been pretty well ascertained it
seems fair to let it go at that and not start
the lost war over again. Still if orthodoxy
of the Shoddygraph kind says the com-
munity must carry a partially-dead elephant
about on its back for ever, there is presum-
ably nothing to be said.
The “No” Vote Comes Home to Roost.
No sooner were N. S. W ales election results
published than certain Trade Unions pro-
ceeded to demand a 40-hour week. There
may be no significance in the coincidence;
but, anyhow, it is unlikely that the Storey
Government will venture to be hostile. N.
S. Wales industries already have a heavier
wage burden to carry than those of any
other State except Queensland. In 1917
manufacturers all over Australia were given
a useful lift. Under the War Precautions
Act the importation of a number of articles
capable of being made in Australia was pro-
hibited. The first list included such N. S.
Wales products as beer, confectionery, bis-
cuits. fur apparel, jewellery and motor-
bodies ; and later it was considerably ex-
tended with the admitted object of further
assisting Australian industries. In 1913
N. S. Wales employed 5346 factory-hands.
According to the most recent estimate it is
now employing 5356. An inevitable effect of
the general adoption of the Saturday whole-
holiday will be an increase in the cost of
living. The railway, tramway and ferry
employees will have to be paid overtime and
the difference will go on to freights and
fares; the shop-assistants’ extra wages will
be added to the price of the goods, or else
the traders will themselves take a holiday
and debit the public with their wasted rent-
money and so on. That might be endurable
to the already hard-pressed consumer of
N. S. Wales if he had any guarantee that
similar conditions would automatically be-
come general throughout the Commonwealth.
As it is, the likeliest effects are that N. S.
Wales industries, which have been practi-
cally stationary for the last six years in
spite of a solid measure of Protection, will
begin definitely to decline. People with
money to invest in factories will shift to
those States where wages are less and holi-
days fewer. W. M. Hughes’s Referendum
proposals were designed to obviate just such
a situation as this; and there is a certain
amount of gloomy entertainment to be got
in consequence from the spectacle of the
embittered manner in which the N. S. Wales
Employers’ Federation and other bodies that
favored a “No” vote are taking the new
development. The most prominent and sen-
sible of the Hughes proposals was to give
statutory authority to representatives of em-
ployers and organised labor to form indus-
trial councils “both in the Commonwealth
and State.” A new Commonwealth Arbitra-
tion Court was to have been constituted, with
a Federal and two State Judges, who would
have power to make a common rule. That
intention was frustrated by the Tories, who
refused to extend the powers of the Com-
monwealth. There would assuredly have
been less likelihood of a Saturday whole-
holiday anywhere if machinery existed to
bring delegates of employers and employees
together from all parts of the Common-
wealth to discuss the whole economic con-
dition. And, even if that failed, there would
have been a further opportunity to produce
uniformity in the matter of holidays and
wages, thus escaping the insane system under
which a man working on one side of an
imaginary line may earn more for fewer
hours’ toil than one engaged in exactly the
same class of work on the other side of the
line.
No Hope!
George Michael Prendergast, of Victoria,
who has plodded along in politics for 26
years, told the Vic. Labor Conference the
other day that there is No Hope of Relief
for Unionists “unless they combine for Direct
Action and are prepared to use the weapon
when other means fail.” No hope—no hope
at all ! Yet unionists have their full share
of political power, and go on strike when
they please, and hold processions very much
as they please, and print very much what
they please, and are returned to Parliament
without anybody faking the ballot to their
detriment. And Prendergast, with a free
railway pass, and courteous policemen to
see him across crowded street corners, has
full permission to form a Ministry at any
hour of the day or night if he can persuade
the free majority that he was meant to be
a Premier. After 26 years’ inspection of
Prendergast they haven’t, however, ac-
cepted him at his own valuation and put
their fate unreservedly in his hands. There
may not be anything in these promulgations
of disappointed failures who talk of taking
control of the country by violence out of the
hands of the people. On the other hand there
may, and it would be a safe thing for the
community to treat the proposal of Direct
Action as plain treason and an incitement to
revolution and bloodshed.
♦
The Way of It.
The newly-formed N. S. Wales Labor Min-
istry will quickly get a chance to establish
its hona fides, or otherwise. Every new State
Labor Ministry does, though none has hither-
to grasped at the opportunity. Two issues
—the abolition of the State Governorship
and the wiping-out of the nominee Legisla-
tive Council —put the acid on the democracy
of the sturdiest. Immediately a Socialist
Ministry is formed its Socialist friends out-
side begin clamoring to be put into the
Council—the place that H. D. Mclntosh
called “Australia’s House of Lords” when
he was Labor’s friend. The rich Socialists
offer cash; the poorer ones promises. A
reason possibly why the plutocrats are usu-
ally chosen. Simultaneously Government
House is busy alluring the Labor Ministers'
wives. Most of the ladies and many of
their husbands are on the smooth, beflowered
road to Toryism before the first division has
been taken in the Assembly. The exploiters
and their friends discover in them a hitherto
unsuspected charm. A couple of weeks ago a
Labor stalwart became Lord Mayor of Sydney.
At his first reception the same people were
there who have figured at similar functions
for years past. These persons are not out-
standingly patriotic or reputable or even
rich. On the contrary. Many of them shirked
their duty in the great crisis through which
civilisation has just passed, as regards both
military and financial service. Others bear
reputations, in commerce and so on, which,
to put it mildly, are inferior to those of
thousands who are never entertained at the
public expense. They are asked to-every
function of importance for no better reason
than that they happen to belong to a clique
which for years past has been asked to such
functions. There might be some justifica-
tion from the Labor standpoint for the reten-
tion of an expensive imported State Gover-
nor if the arrival of a Labor Ministry meant
State-aided food, drink and entertainment
for a reasonable proportion of those workers
who put the Ministry in power. But what
invariably happens is that Mr. and Mrs. Jazz
and family, of Darling Point, continue to be
amused on the cheap at the taxpayers’
expense, while the Browns, of Bal-
main, stay at home. Later the Jazzes
agree more or less condescendingly
to know the new Ministers, and Jazz
senior intimates his willingness to take
a .seat in the Upper House. By which time
the thought of singing “The Red Flag” at
a social gathering gives Ministers a cold
chill down the spine. A plausible excuse is
needed for so sharp a reversal of form. It
is always available in the shape of “State
patriotism.” To dispense with an English
Governor and to do away with a nominee
House of obstructionists are represented as
measures which may “lower the dignity of
the State.” Rival States would, in that
event, be given an opportunity to jeer. Bet-
ter the expenditure of many thousands sterl-
ing per annum than that such an exasperat-
ing event should befall! Labor Ministers
may be Internationalists: many of them are.
But to forego the luxury of inter-State
jealousy and dislike—this is asking- more of
human nature than it can supply !

The Ally that Has fhe Hun for a
Neighbor.
The position on the Franco-llun border is
that the French and Belgian forces have
made a move, and Lloyd George has made a
protest, and the other Allies have done
nothing, and the sick but almighty Wilson
has intimated that things should be left un-
done until he makes up his wandering mind.
The position doesn’t seem really compli-
cated. Across the Rhine is a neutral zone,
which was to be left unoccupied by the
troops of both parties. Hun soldiers, said
to be rebels and beyond control, occupied it
and raged exceedingly, and Hun troops, said
to be loyal, wanted to enter and either join
them or fight them. Either way there seemed
too much Hun in the neutral zone close to
the French border. One of the terms of the
peace was that the Hun should at once start
paying a small part of the French indemnity
in coal. During the war he had blown up
and wrecked most of the mines on the only
coalfield France possessed. This may not
seem a very important matter to people at
a distance; but if it was the coalmines of
Newcastle and Maitland and Bulli and Lith-
gow that a retreating enemy had destroyed,
Australia would notice the point. The coal
which the Hun was to provide hasn’t been
forthcoming—except a lump now and then.
In fact, after the first panic-stricken surren-
der of his fleet, which was treacherously
sunk when he got his second wind, the Hun
put his tail up and paid practically nothing.
Apparently he aimed at starving France into
submission by coal famine. At any rate
Hun rebels began to swarm over the coal-
fields on which France largely depended for
its supply, and threatened to destroy the
mines, just as another crowd had destroyed
the fleet. The position by which mines in
which France had a big interest were left
under German control was, of course, a de-
vice of Wilson, the sick schoolmaster, who
did moslp things wrong. The French and Bel-
gians are therefore occupying the danger
zone. No doubt the League of Nations should
have done it; but the League has no perma-
nent Cabinet which can be called together
at a moment’s notice, and self-preservation
required prompt action from France. That
action may prevent further trouble. If it
doesn’t Britain can no more decently aban-
don France now than she could at any time
during the war. Nor can the United States.

Concerning a Sche?nie to Enlighten
Australia.
Dr. Leeper, of the Vic. Loyalist League, has
been telling the London Spectator all about
the Romish menace in Australia. Some of
his statements look odd when contrasted: —
i.
The Irish element here is very far from being
negligible. The latest returns show that it com-
prises over a fifth of the population. For political
purposes it is the best organised and the most
united section of the community.
Loyal Australians who have long been fretting
impatiently at the too easy tolerance of sedition
by the authorities, find much consolation in the late
Federal elections, by which a sharp rebuff has
been given to the Sinn Feiners and Bolshevists.
11.
Our great papers spoke against the Roman
Catholic menace with a vigor and frankness that
must have startled the leaders of that Church.
The ignorance prevailing about the whole Irish
question is very deep and widespread.
in.
Through its working alliance with the Labor
Party the Roman Church has become a powerful
factor in State politics.
As regards the last allegation, Labor in
A. S. Wales refused to have anything to do
with the R.C. claim that denominational
schools should be helped by the State. The
section which asks for this concession went
to the polls at the recent election as a
separate party. It polled 15,000 votes in all
—one vote for every eight R.C. electors in
the State. However, Dr. Leeper is right
in one respect. Many thousands here take
what he considers to be the wrong side about
Ireland. But the religious issue has nothing
to do with it. It is a matter of being
outside the direct influence of British party
politics and their catch-cries. Thousands of
freedom-loving Protestant Australians look
with bewilderment on the traditional Union-
ist party attitude towards the Irish question.
It appears to them to be based on the prin-
ciple of always offering something which the
Irish have previously stated their intention
of refusing. A very mild form of Home
Rule would have been gratefully accepted in
Gladstone’s day. It was withheld. The
measure of autonomy given to the Boers
would have satisfied Ireland 15 years ago.
It was refused. Dominion Home Rule
•would have done at the time Edward Car-
son and the present Lord Chancellor
of England - were careering about Ulster
with their Army of Rebellion. It was
denied. By what has been neatly de-
scribed as “a policy of recurrent exaspera-
tion” the Unionists have now obstructed the
Irish into demanding a republic. That is
how it appears to most of those who do not
take their opinions from the Carlton Club.
Dr. Deeper urges England through the
Spectator to send delegates to Australia who
will explain just why Ireland—which pro-
vided more volunteer soldiers, proportion-
than the Commonwealth during the war
for Freedom, and which in culture is second
to no nation—should be denied that which has
been allowed to such places , as Cuba and
Liberia. If the delegates can give better
reasons why Ireland should be held in
chains, however gilded by the money of Eng-
lish taxpayers, than the ancient claim, (in-
supportable on moral grounds, that self-
determination might be a bad thing for Eng-
land, then they will be welcomed. But if
their only purpose is to push forward side-
issues such as the Church of Rome, the
obvious answer is that we possess in Dr.
Deeper, of Victoria, and Mr. Henley, of
N. S. Wales, men who can provide that sort
of fodder as well as any imports.

Australia’s Manufacturing Opportunity.
Ouu stupendous debt makes it necessary
that we shall import only what cannot be
produced in Australia. More, it makes it
imperative that whatever we export shall
be sent abroad in the form or condition in
which it will bring the most money. For-
tunately the circumstances are such that
the worst of procrastinators cannot affirm
that the time is not ripe for this coun-
try to set ui) workshops. The dislocation
caused by the war has resulted in some
transactions that would have been scouted
as impossible if hinted at in 11)14. Aus-
tralia is now manufacturing motor-cars for
export to Java, Singapore and India. Many
of the component parts are imported from
the U.S.A., but at least one-third of them
are made in Australian workshops, and the
whole of the body-work, upholstering and
the materials thereof are Australian.
One motor-manufacturer recently received
a cablegram from London offering to take
one hundred if he could supply them in 12
months. What would have been said of
the idea of Australia exporting Australian-
built motor-cars to London four years ago!
A few weeks ago a N. S. Wales manufac-
turer shipped 100 tons of Australian-made
gelatine to ’Frisco, where it would have to
pay 20 per Cent, ad val. duty. The price
was 1410 per ton f.o.b. Sydney. This indus-
try is one of the products of the war, and
furnishes an excellent example of how much
better it is to export the finished article
than the raw material. It takes two and a
half tons of raw material to make one ton
of gelatine. The price of the raw material
for export was from £9 to £l2 per ton in
1913, when about 40 per cent, of what we
produced was exported. Had the Ameri-
cans taken instead of that 100 tons of fin-
ished gelatine 250 tons of raw material all
that Australia would have got for it would
have been £3OOO. By exporting the finished
gelatine our continent got £41,000 —a clear
national gain of £38,000. That is the dif-
ference between exporting primary products
and manufactured goods. The difference
goes mostly in wages. To-day Australia is
producing the finest gelatine and glue in the
world. All top-grade gelatine we can export
will yield this country at least 12 times more
than we would obtain for the raw material.
Any industry that shows such a national profit
is worthy of effective protection, and not on
that account only but because with sup-
plies on the spot secondary industries benefit.
Thus the confectionery manufacturers of
Australia have received their gelatine at
over £lOO per ton cheaper than they could
have imported it from Europe or America ;
they got their supplies much cheaper than,
did the British and TJ.S.A. manufacturers,
and that was one reason why the export of
confectionery also became possible. If, how-
ever, the industry is to be made safe, more
extensive protection is required than even
the present tariff grants. This is a waste-
product industry, and like most of that
class must be operated on a large scale to
show a profit. The chief sources of dan-
gerous competition are Japan, China, U.S.A.
and Germany. The Japanese have enormous
supplies of raw material close at hand in
China and Siberia at not more than a few
shillings per ton, plus freight. They can
land their raw material at their factories
for less than £1 per ton. American capital-
ists are establishing factox-ies in China; and
the most serious danger is from American
dumpers. Under the Frith Act American
Trusts can buy the products of the cheapest
markets in the world, take them to the
U.S.A. in bond, stamp them as products of
the U.S.A. and re-export them. Already
several concerns are operating under this
Act, and it is these concerns that are in-
vesting capital in Asia. Under conditions
less favoi-able than those that now prevail
it would pay the gelatine and glue manufac-
turers of Australia to move to Java or
Singapore, .ship the Australian raw materials
there for manufactui-e, and export the fin-
ished article back to Australia. In that
case, of course, the national pi’ofit of manu-
facture would stay in those lands where the
heathen in his blindness bows down to long
hours and low wages.
«
Papua and its Troubles.
“Mabsina” : As indicated by recent happen-
ings in Port Moresby, when a section of the
European residents of Papua wanted to
follow Northern Territory precedent and de-
port the Lieut.-Governoi-, Judge Murray, by
the Morinda, the Home and Territories De-
partment has another hard nut to crack.
The meeting of protest was certainly not
unanimous by any means, and, furthermore,
was attended by only a portion of the white
community. Apart, however, from Mur-
ray’s fitness or unfitness for the job, the
questions concerned intimately affect the
future of Papua, and a lot depends on what
attitude is going to be officially adopted as
regards plantations, i-ecruiting and the de-
velopment of the resources pf the country.
Recruiting, for instance, is being permitted
to such an alarming extent that -whole vil-
lages have been depopulated, the men . being
taken away to the plantations to work (with

the threat of the head-tax held over them),
and separated from their wives and families
for a period of three years or so, which is
not conducive to either morality or natural
progress. Recruiting will have to be
stringently regulated if development in the
right direction is expected. One of the
charges levelled against Murray is lack of
sympathy with the Europeans; but that begs
the whole question. What is he expected
to sympathise with? Ordinarily, the more
or less aggressive new settler who comes to
"open up” the country has one object only
in view—to swell his own banking account
and then get out. His troubles about the
country! The native, on the other hand,
doesn’t see any particular points in bursting
himself simply to give the Big Boss a good
time. Murray probably feels that the fact
of a man being white doesn’t necessarily
mean that he’s either a gentleman or a
worthy representative of the race. What is
necessary, as Tiie Bulletin pointed out
when the trouble occurred, is that the Com-
monwealth should arrive at a definite policy
regarding the development of the Possession.
Further, we must have an organisation to
train officials to carry out their job. The
policy of sending officials who have no other
qualifications than those of whisky-drinking
and billiard-marking, and whose attitude
towards the native is frankly hostile, and
who, further, leave their morals behind in
Australia, is no good to the Commonwealth.
The thing is too serious to be played with.
Even the missionary societies long since re-
cognised that their representatives must be
men of proved character and carefully trained.
The native is quick to see through even Gov-
ernment officials, and promptly loses all re-
spect for “Big Guv’ment” if he finds its re-
presentatives free with his women or swilling
rum over-abundantly. No amount of bluff
or bullying or arrogant superiority will make
up for this.

Contoi tional Representation.
A very general hope exists that the new
system of Contortional Representation had
its first and last run at the N. S. Wales
election of 1920. With its strange kinks of
adding one to the total number of votes
polled, and then dividing by six for five
members or four for three members, and
calling the result a quota, it is a sort of lunar
eclipse to begin with. Then the distortional
thing ties itself in a knot and has three fits
and a cough and starts in pursuit of the
quota. (For further details read Lewis
Carroll’s “Hunting of the Snark,” which
was pursued “with forks and hope.”) The
surplus first preference of any successful
candidates are given away to other candi-
dates if there aren’t enough successful candi-
dates. This happens except when the sur-
plus preferences of the third candidate aren’t
equal to the difference between the ninth and
tenth candidate; in that case the votes are
put in the stove. The second preferences of
the successful candidates, instead of being
counted as in the Preferential system, are
thrown out of the window. The seventh
candidate is then thrown out of the window
also. Under the new Abortional Repre-
sentation there are great chances for a man
whose misspent life has been devoted to
working out useless and tangled elec-
toral schemes and bringing in imag-
inary candidates by way of illustra-
tion at meetings of the Young Flap-
pers’ United Geological Association. If
you know the ropes (but nobody does and
nobody ever will) you can quite honestly
bring in your candidate without any votes
at all, and if you are absolutely new to the
business you can have a walk-over and then
lose your deposit. Three months’ hard
counting may be spent in doing this, but it
can be done. It ,<jeems a wild jest that the
Circumfusional system of voting makes no
provision at all for the. filling of casual
vacancies, but the reason is obvious enough.
For exactly the same reason Philip, father
of Alexander, marvellous organiser though
he was. made no arrangements for catch s ng
rabbits with his Macedonian phalanx. That
military machine was too cumbersome. For
a similar reason Dreadnoughts don’t go
prawning.

“Guy Rope” on the systematic overcrowd-
ing of N.S.W. schools :
Of course the Education Department is to blame ;
it admits it, and goes serenely along the same
old groove. One body could, however, bump it
out. All over the State to-day and every day head-
masters and -mistresses are making appeals to the
pupils in an endeavor to gain theij co-operation in
chasing other little sardines into the tins. Truant-
inspectors are egged on by industrious headmasters
and absentee-notices go out in sheaves. An almost
door-to-door canvass proceeds to see that no pupils
are getting to a school in another “district.” Yet
classes are taught under trees! And this is the
explanation: Schools are divided into classes or
grades, and the class in which a school is placed
depends entirely on the number of pupils enrolled
in that school. If a school climbs a class higher
(i.e., begets a larger enrolment), up go the salaries
of headmaster, head-mistress and first-assistants!
As the newly-enrolled pupils, as a rule, enter the
lower classes, the ordinary assistant merely gets
the increase of work. It is our headmasters and
-mistresses who hold the key to the sardine-tin
problem. It is within their power to send every
child home for whom there is not sufficient and
hygienic accommodation, and it is within their power
to set a room apart for their staff. If they had
backbone enough to do this the Department would
wake up. So would the public.
♦
The new rates of pay for permanent mili-
tary officers are unique in that nobody earn-
ing under £350 a year gets a rise, but every-
body receiving over that sum does. Not-
withstanding the war losses it takes six
years for a lieutenant to get a captaincy
and will take longer in the future, which
means that officers under (say) 28 years—
i.e., the majority—are not affected by the
new rates. When it is noted that these
same juniors earned up to £7OO a year and
found at the war, and that the British staff
lieutenant gets from £540 to £644 and pen-
sion (vide Army Order 324/1919), while
the Australian gets £250, rising to £375, after
six years’ service and no pension—which
rate has not been altered for 20 years, in
spite of the rise in the cost of living—one
INSIDE KNOWLEDGE.
THE EVICTED TENANT (after a vigorous scrap to retain possession): “Anyway, it’s

can only come to the conclusion that the
authorities wish to discourage the sons of
poor parents from becoming officers.

“Gordon” : Li.oyd George and “Solomon
Malaprop” (B. l/4/’2O) draw a parallel
between the claim to secession by the
Southern States of U.S.A. and Ireland’s de-
mand for a republic. It is a specious com-
parison. The Articles of Confederation,
1777, were an agreement between the
colonies providing for a perpetual union.
The Constitution of 1787 brought about a
“more perfect form of Union” and was
adopted by each of the then States. The
nullification movement by South Carolina
in 1832 was promptly checked by Andrew
Jackson, Southern though he was. No law
existed against secession, since none was
needed, any more than one is needed now
to prevent the northern portion of N. S.
Wales from forming a new State. If the
people in that territory desire to form a
new State they must do so either by a suc-
cessful rebellion or by a law passed by the
present State of which they form a part;
and the position in U.S.A. was just the
same. But Ireland is a conquered country,
and the union with England has never been
other than a forced one. It may not suit
England that Ireland should withdraw, but
at least let us be honest about it. Ireland
is a subject province of an empire, and em-
pires are certainly not built on the principle
of self-determination. The Southern States
were not subject provinces of an empire,
and neither the glibness of Lloyd George
nor the wisdom of “Solomon Malaprop”
can overcome this essential difference.

A petition comes to Tiie B. from Rabaul:
With the cries of the Returned Soldier ringing in
our ears —ringing with claims of war gratuities,
furlough allowances and land and housing conces-
sions—we, members of the force occupying the
former German possessions, have to carry on with
no information as to when our services are to be
terminated nor what inducements are to be offered
to us to stay in these Possessions under the pro-
jected, but nebulous, Civil Administration. The
majority of the soldiers now here are returned men
with as much claim on the Commonwealth as any
man holding a similar qualification south; but
while the men at home are snapping concession
after concession, we can get no definite information
about anything. What everyone wants to know is
(1) Are the men here, from highest to lowest, to
be given preference under a Civil Administration
for such jobs as will be open? (2) If such prefer-
ence is given, will the wage be a living one, or
—and this is what we fear—will it be the same
as the starvation rate in Papua ? You who live
in Australia may date when these Posses-
sions will revert from a Military to a Civil Ad-
ministration, but we don’t. We have our future
to consider, our homes to Support; but we never
know, even from day to day, when we may be told
that the next boat south will terminate our ser-
vice. Is there no one who has the strength or the
power to say, “On such and such a day shall your
military service terminate” ? Surely we have some
right to know. May we?
Archie Peake, born in London in 1859,
came this way at the age of three, and gave
all his life to S. Australia. District Clerk
at Narracoorte, in the south-east, for years,
and a keen student of literature (he was a
valued contributor to The Bulletin ), he
made a dramatic entry into Parliament in
1897: he beat the old-established local mem-
ber, George Riddoch, by two votes ; conducted
his own case, against Symon, on a disputed
return; lost it; then won a fresh election
comfortably. By 1905 he was in office
with Price, on whose death he went right
to the top, being'-later associated with But-
ler. He had had nearly 11 years, of office
had been Premier this time for nearly three'
and was easily the strongest man in sight
In character he was unexcitable, hut a good
fighter, conspicuously honest and fond of
literature and of quiet home life—in short
exactly what a S. Australian likes to think
a typical S. Australian is.
Holman, who was admitted to the X. S.
Wales Bar in 1903. will apply for silk, and
set out to win the big practice that is wait-
ing for him.
Some time in 191 G Judge Murray, Lieut.-
Governor of Papua, was announced to call
in at Rabaul, late German New Guinea,
when returning from a tour of the British
Solomons. The day of his arrival dawned
and a guard of honor was drawn up on the
wharf to do honor to the potentate. It was
a fiasco. His Ex. landed in clothing that
could only oe described as being of a dis-
tinctly busy variety, and he passed the guard
without a glance—didn’t even take off his hat
or do whatever else he ought to have done
under the circumstances. Murray’s next
advent in Rabaul was with a Royal Commis-
sion. This time the guard of honor was
conspicuous by its absence. Once bitten
twice shy.
P. G. Stewart, who beat Sampson for
Wimmera for the House of Reps, in
December, has smartened up marvellously
since he was first elected to the Vic. Assembly
in November, 1917. Then he looked as
rough a diamond as Jimmy McLauchlan,
M.L.A. for North Gippsland. Ilis intense
earnestness soon earned respect for him in
the Assembly, and he has begun to say
pointed things too. When Hughes expressed
horror at the suggestion that he should have
bought sugar in Java in big quantities with-
out waiting for Parliamentary authority.
Stewart chipped in by telling him it was
just the sort of thing he would have done if
he had thought of it. Stewart was a second
or two ahead of the other critics in re-
membering that Hughes had bought a whole
fleet once without consulting anybody but
himself.
“Macquarie Street”: Sydney Crown Law
authorities have apparently a poor opinion
of the therapeutic virtues of the Maoriluml
thermal springs in cases of nervous exhaus-
tion, psychasthenia, or whatever mysterious
nervous complaint George Georgeson is suf-
fering from, since, in reply to a wire from
the Federal Minister as to the advisability
of granting passports to the patient, a
nurse and an attendant, they said that
Georgeson’s presence was necessary in N. S.
Wales —for what reason is not very clear,
since the latest official bulletin issued by the
specialists, in consultation with the patient’s
own doctor, held out no hope of Georgeson
ever being able to give evidence before the
Wheat Commission, or even to make an
appearance there. Since the whole affair
from the start has hinged on the medical
evidence, it , seems curious that, although
the application was backed up by medical
opinion as to the good result likely to be
obtained by a visit to the hot springs, the
certificates of the doctors were flouted, and
the Law authorities refused the patient
the opportunity of testing the efficacy of
these useful and thoroughly sound thera-
peutic agents. Perhaps the B.M.A. will take
a hand in the matter V At any rate, in
common justice, the medical certificates
accompanying the application should be pub-
lished.
“Copabella”: Cocky doesn’t always lean
up against the Government. In 1902 some
of him in the Otway country of Victoria
wanted a road. Instead of fighting with
their mouths for it, they put up a sum of
money and went down from their fastnesses
to the Barrabool shire council and asked
for a municipal £ to be stacked on each of
theirs. They got it. Next they wanted a
State school, but they were so far out in
the wilds the Education Department could
neither see nor hear them. So they built
a school, which a shamed Government after-
wards took off their hands at £250. With
this the battlers paid off £5O they owed on
the building, and with the other £2OO made
more road. Next they wanted a telephone
bureau. The Postal Department laughed;
so they built their own. (Later on the
Department took that over, too.) Rabbits
next roused the energies of Paraparap. They
wiped bunny out in a co-operative onslaught,
and then turned back again to the road.
Their story so impressed Edgar, then Min-
ister for Works in Vic., that he set a train
going which resulted in the erection of
the Country Roads Board of Victoria, and
a complete change in the State’s road-build-
ing policy. Battling on, working themselves
on their road with “bees,” traction-engines
and idle-horse teams, the settlers, after a
total of £2500 had been subscribed by them-
selves, persuaded the Board at last to take
over the road. The shire council then jibbed
at finding its half-share of maintenance, but
the unsuppre.ssible cockies offered £lOO a
year for seven years towards this, and the
council for very shame had again to agree.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Senator Milieu stated at the Sydney Show
that “Australia is a laud dropping riches.’’
True! It has dropped millions down the
hole of the Millen importing policy, and
impoverished itself in the process.
Fihelly, Acting-Premier of Queensland,
has been charged with making another im-
pudent precedent in that, while not a lawyer,
he has appointed himself to act as Attorney-
General. Of course it is not a precedent,
impudent or otherwise. Half a dozen lay-
men have held the Attorney-General’s office
in Australia. Nobody could accuse the
just-dead A. H. Peake, of S. Aus., of impu-
dence; yet from the middle of 1905 to the
end of 1909, though not a lawyer, he was
Attorney-General; and John Earle, who was
no lawyer either, was twice Attorney-
General of Tasmania. Fred Holder, of S.
Aus., acted as Attorney-General, too; and
he afterwards offered the opinion that it
might be a very good thing if no lawyer
held the office for 10 years, so that plain
commonsense might have a chance to sim-
plify law proceedings.
Harwell, who has come to the top in
South Aus., as Roose-
velt did in the U.S.A.,
through the sudden
death of his chief, has
some of the “Teddy”
qualities. He is a
fighter. Adelaide-born,
and educated at St.
Peter’s and the Uni.,
he made straight for
Port Pirie on taking
his law degree, 20
years ago. At that
flourishing outport he
built up a big practice,
and filled all sorts of
loegl offices. In 1915
he got into Parliament,
and moved to Adelaide.
Within two years he
was Attorney-General,
and now he is Premier,
at 43. He has the
brains and the
courage; whether he
has the administrative
ability—and the luck
required in the
troubled circumstances,
remains to be seen.
BARWELL, the
new South Aus.
Premier.
Leaving out candidates belonging to non-
descript sections which failed to return any
members to the N. S. Wales Assembly, the
first name on the ballot-paper (the order
was alphabetical) won in 15 electorates out
of 24. Electors, having marked their first
choice, seem to have mostly voted for the
remaining candidates of their party in alpha-
betical order, and, after thus accounting for
their own party, their general practice was
to mark the paper from the top down. In
Balmain Smith beat Stopford although his
first votes were 3016 to Stopford’s 3911. In
North Shore Reid triumphed over Walker
for the last seat; the quota had to be
obtained fx - om the distribution of the votes
of the Democratic candidate, with whoin
neither Reid nor Walker had anything in
common. In Cumberland Carr beat Fitz-
sinxons for third seat; in Eastern Suburbs
Fingleton was elected before O’Halloran,
although the respective first votes were
2152 and 3245. In St. George Gosling beat
Toombs although his first votes were 2109
to 3788. Greig (Ryde), with 100 fewer
first votes than Hutchison, beat the latter.
In Namoi Crane’s Ministerial prestige was
outweighed by Chaffey’s higher place on the
ballot-paper. *At Maitland Cameron, with
some 1400 fewer first votes than Nicholson,
beat him for last seat; the quota was
obtained from the distribution of Brennan’s
(Labor) votes. At Murrumbidgee Flan-
nery beat sitting member McGirr; there
was a difference of only three in their first
votes, but Flannery happened first on the
ballot-paper and gained the greater part of
the third Labor man’s preferences. An
election system which gives such results
ought not to be allowed a second chance.
The talk of the Vic. State lobbies: —
If the Vie. Liberals decide to bury differences at
the coming general election in order to beat Labor
and Hayseeds, reconstruction of the Government will
be essential. It is hardly conceivable that Peacock
will serve under Lawson or Lawson under Peacock,
and it is still more unlikely that Peacock will accept
office under McPherson. A suggestion' discussed in
whispers is that Donald Mackiunon should be given the
chance to lead, and thus realise a life-long yearning.
Peacock, Lawson and McPherson would probably be
willing to serve under Higinbotham’s protege, who
has done spade work for them all. It is 20 to one
that if Mackinnon became Premier he would be con-
tent to serve in an honorary capacity, as he does now
as administrator of the Lands Department, and
would allot the eight stipendiary portfolios to
others. To secure a team that would be regarded as
representative it would be necessary in the reshuffle
to drop Clarke, Buird, Barnes, Oman and Campbell,
and to take in Baillieu, Peacock, McLeod, Living-
ston and one or two more acceptable to the leading
three.
The Vic. Carpenters’ Union puts in its
claim for a 40-hours week and a wage of
2s. 3d. per hour. For good work 2s. 3d. per
hour (£4 10s. per week) is none too much,
but the unreason lies in not making it 48
hours and £5 Bs. per week or more. No
tradesman should make less than 108 s. per
week or be worth less. The exasperating
thing is that the spokesman of the 40-hour
party don’t take the trouble to allege that
48 hours’ carpentering is bad for the health
or spirits; nor do they profess that they
have anything special or good or intelligent
that they want to do with the extra eight
hours’ leisure; nor do they say that work
is scarce and that the 48-hour worker is
keeping his fellow out of a job. They simply
take up the attitude that there is some obvu
ous virtue in leaving work undone even at
their own loss and the country’s loss. If
they realised that this means condemning
men, women and children, of their own
class, into hopelessly insufficient space, to
the ruin of health and decency, they would
be ashamed of it. But they don’t realise
it because the men who ought to make
them think that way are too busy tickling
their ears with tales that are pleasanter to
listen to.
There are usually two or three big busi-
ness men in a Ministry; but, though The
Bulletin has watched them putting col-
leagues and dangerous rivals who wanted a
steady job into all sorts of Government bil-
lets, it doesn’t remember any case in which
they have grabbed these superlatively capable
men for big jobs in their own businesses.
For the recent Indian riots in Suva ancl
the adjacent Fijian districts of Rewa and
Navua the Bolshevik was responsible; but
in this case he was only made use of by
the Indian Nationalists; and the National-
ists are only concerned, for a start, in push-
ing the dominant white man out. The insti-
gator of the Fijian trouble was an educated
Indian, a reputed Bolshevik; but he didn’t
incite to the Bolshevik’s class warfare, and
the outbreak was purely racial: he picked
on a time when food supplies were short
owing to the engineers’ strike to test the
sahibs. But it was a worse test for his own
people: these poor coolies had no stomach
for fight, and the race “war” was over as
soon as the guns and the cold steel were
brought out. Still, this is not going to be
the end of it.
Labor in Victoria positively refuses to
trust its womenfolk in matters of political
management, though the missus is supposed
to lend her aid in full strength at polling
time. A motion was submitted at the
Easter Conference in Melbourne providing
for the election of four women to the cen-
tral executive, and Labor got up and roared
“No!” in a loud, manly voice which com-
pletely smothered the scarce “Ayes” of the
liberal-minded brethren. Woman is all right
in her place as a collector of cash and votes,
a preparer of early breakfasts and an eker-
out of strike-pay in times of stress; but as
an intellectual co-operator in uplift—rub-
bish ! Labor probably recognises that
foolish woman doesn’t really favor strikes,
direct action, go-slow, T.N.T. and such aids
to peace and prosperity. Wherefore she
will continue to stay out of the council
chamber while the nobler animal is busy
evolving a new batch of progressive ideas.
The just-arrived N. S. Wales Labor Ministry
contains two boilermakers, two miners, two
school-teachers, a tailor, a chemist, a work-
ing journalist, a shop-assistant, a house-and-
land agent and a barrister. These men have
the Government of the country. Yet Pren-
derga.st,, the Vic. Labor leader, has just
been telling a conference in Melbourne that
there is no hope for unionists unless they
become direct actionists, and Blackburn, his
colleague, has wept crocodile’s tears over the
“unprivileged classes.”
“Two Seas” on postal economy :
It was thought that the late Poet-P.M.G. had
exhausted the possibilities; but Wise has found a
new dodge to help build up a surplus. From country
exchanges the P.M. is ringing tip to inquire if sub-
scribers will agree to pay 2s. 6d. per ajinum for
that telephone receiver which swings on a string and
is only brought into use when the line is more than
commonly out of order. If one refuses, this article,
for which one has paid rent, is to be removed by a
highly-paid mechanic, who will have to journey out

some miles to do it —a job that will mop up about
eight years’ rent. If a private property-owner sent
notice to his tenant that he would arrive with a
wrecking gang to pull down the spare room unless

darn-well pleases. -
“Good Australian”: The Australian Notes
Act of 1910 directed the Commonwealth
Treasurer to hold not less than one-fourth
gold coin against an issue up to
£7,000,000. To-day the issue is over
£56,000,000 and the gold held in support is
£24,000,000. But the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment got £16,000,000 of that £24,000,000
from the banks by a forced levy. Therefore,
the real position is that there are over
£40.000,000 notes circulating as currency
against an average reserve of £8.000,000.
The £16,000,000, which rightly belongs to
the joint-stock banks, should be repaid to
them. At no time did their note-issue
exceed £4,000.000. The various States which
have borrowed the £40,000,000 from the Aus-
tralian Notes Fund ought to be asked to
repay it, or, at least, it should be funded
with the Australian debt, and the notes cur-
rent called in and destroyed. Twice in the
last three years I have written the Federal
Treasurer suggesting a 6 p.c. gold loan in
New York for £30,000,000 to repay the un-
wanted notes floating round this country and
causing high prices and extravagance, public
and private, but the Treasurer w T on’t even
acknowledge receipt of the suggestion.
Surely it is worth considering? The defla-
tion of the currency is the very highest and
most important action to be taken to save
this country from a gehenna of a smash.
The future of Hughes, Ryan, Watt, McWil-
liams and Tudor is as nothing compared
with the urgent need to get the Australian
currency back on to safe and sound lines.
“Haragigi”: The Bulletin’s suggestion
that Circuit Judges should be appointed for
the outlying territories of the Common-
wealth deserves most serious consideration
by the Federal authorities. In Papua the
trouble is aggravated by the fact that the
Chief Judicial Officer is also Lieuf.-Gov.,
whilst his deputy is a member of the Exe-
cutive and Legislative Councils, and also
Parliamentary draftsman. Both officials
are gentlemen of unimpeachable integrity;
but a Judge should never be placed in the
position of having to interpret his own law.
In a recent Case before the Central Court
in which the Government was a litigant, a
Judge and staff had to be imported from
II aba ul.
Vic. Education Department has drawn
the attention of teachers to the regulation
which forbids officials to make communica-
tions to the press on any matters connected
with their work. The regulation was framed
to prevent departmental officers from divulg-
ing information obtained in the course of
their official duties,
and that of course is
right; but the present
purpose of the Depart-
ment is evidently to
gag teachers in their
efforts to bring before
the public the justice
of (1) their claims
to increased salaries,
and (2) the ch'ldren’s
claims to decent ac-
commodation. How
adverse the Depart-
ment is to - teachers
having opinions o f
their own may be
judged by the fact that
the same notice states
that communications
on matters of general
interest should bo
made only with the
approval of the Min-
ister.
“Peter Pan”: The
manager of a meat-
preserving co. told me
that two of his
slaughtermen can, Sf
they like, earn £2O a
week. Of course
they never do, because
they work two days
and “lay oft"’ two
more. At Darwin re-
cently six wharfies
working at night in
12-hour shifts, earned
£76 10s. each for a
fortnight’s work load-
ing a steamer with
meat. Plenty of junior
clerks personally
known to me earn
that much in 12
months. And a let-
ter-carrier told me
yesterday he earned
£lf)C a year tramp-
ing the Melbourne
streets and walking upstairs and down from
daylight to dark. The Middle-Class Party
just hatched in Melbourne hasn’t arrived one
day too soon.
One of Treasurer Watt’s errands in Eng-
land is to insist on Hans Hun paying- the
indemnity. Foch is said to be over the
border with 100,000 men or so on very
similar business, and when Watt joins him
things should hum.
When barracking for higher pay at their
annual conference some of the Vic. State
teachers asserted that- they would be right
up against it but for what they made at
rabbiting after school hours. The wife of
one of the struggling trainers of the young
idea, it was related, took in washing to
keep down the household deficit. The con-
science of the I.awson team has been aroused.
Having provided £068.000 a year to swell
the wages of railway men, mostly unskilled,
the Treasury bin is to be scraped out for
the pedagogues from July 1 next.
The N.S.W. Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Pre-
ference Act is clashing in a queer way with
the w r ork of the Repatriation Department.
The Federal Act gives a wide interpretation
to “soldier” and “sailor,” and for the sake
of those who enlisted but were unfortunate
in not getting away it provides benefits to
men w-ho saw no overseas service. A
returned man in the eyes of the State Act
is a man who has been overseas. To others,
therefore. N. S. Wales employers are not
compelled to yield preference; consequently
men who have been “repatriated” by the
Federal authorities are, in some cases, being
dismissed to make way for men who have
been overseas; and the man who has been
repatriated by the Federal concern, and
sacked because the State law does not regard
him as a soldier, may go back to try for
further “repatriation” from the Common-
wealth.

When this co.’s shareholders met in Perth
practically nine months had elapsed since
its financial year had closed. The Westra-
lian Insurance is no longer the mild little
battler it was only six years ago, when it
was struggling hard to pick up any crumbs
left by the big overseas and inter-State con-
cerns. Nowadays it is international itself,
and takes months to collect its branch re-
sults. Last year premiums slumped over
half a million, and had that happened in any
other office the staff would have thought of
reaching for its hat. But even a greater
slump might have been expected in this
concern, and had the year been wholly one
of peace the bump would have been more
sudden. The Westralian Insurance has
made its rise out of one of the biggest
gambles ever attempted in insurance. When
war broke out the co.’s founder, Sam Cop-
ley, made for London and plunged heavily
in war risks. His daring easily brought him
a huge business, for the old hard-headed
underwriter was not too sure of the British
Navy and limited his risks. This shows
what happened :

Sam Copley had for years experienced a
great run of luck, and it held good during
the war. His rise reads like a fairy-tale.
Twenty-five years ago he was a barber in
Fremantle, and with his shavings dabbled
; n real estate, eventually pulling off' a big
deal with Robinson, afterwards Westralian
Attorney-General. Copley then took up sev-
eral cattle-stations and ran half a dozen
butchers’ shops in Perth, making a further
leap. Then came the Western Australian
Insurance Co., and Copley’s biggest gamble.
Nowadays he is known as a “Yorkshire
millionaire.” having purchasing Huddersfield
for li million, while London now has its
Copley’s Bank.
How well the gamble worked out is shown
in the first table. At the June, 1919, bal-
ance practically all war claims had been
settled, and at that date reserves amounted
to £716,163 (after payment of 15 p.c. divi-
dend) compared with only £6BB five years
previously. But that does not record the full
extent of the lift given the co. by the war.
Originally its operations were confined to
Westralia ; it is now in five continents, and
though it is mostly represented by agents, it
has its own branches in Australasia, the U.K.
and F ranee. So, besides substantial reserves,
it has also acquired a world-wide organisa-
tion. It is an amazing record, the more
so because of the very slender security on
which the co. was able to rope in policy-
holders. For instance, when it set out to
write its first big figures, in 1917, total
funds amounted to not quite £lOl,OOO.
During the year £40,000 of new capital
was got in, and with this £141,000,
which had also to cover unexpired risks on
business written in 1916, the co. handled
£727,000 of premiums, the ratio of funds
to premiums being under 20 p.c., whereas
under normal conditions a proportion of 120
p.c. is considered as being on the weak side.
Had Wilhelm inflicted a 120 p.c. loss rate that
year, the West Australian Insurance Co.
would have smashed. Instead of being tor-
pedoed, however, it piled up huge profits,
and can nowadays afford the policy-holder
very reasonable protection; in fact, much
better than can many of its big English com-
petitors ; for though last year’s premiums
included much war risk business, funds at
June 30 last represented almost 130 p.c. of
the premium income.
A comparison of assets as at the latest
balance with those of five years ago puts
the tape over the record leap in another
way: 1914 . 1919.
Government securities .. Nil £304,868

Debtors and agency balances 1,014 - 1 7,483
Cash, etc 1,172 315,98/
Odds and ends . . • • 204 3,481
At the 1914 balance a little £199 was owing
on sundry accounts; at the latest balance,
£127.860. It is almost incredible that a co.’s
figures could be built up in that way on a
paid capital increased only from £40,0U0 to
£lOO,OOO.
As the first table hints, a Life department
has been established, and £20,000 of the huge
undivided surplus has been transferred to
start an assurance fund. It is unlikely that
any big effort will be made by the co. to
push this business in the Commonwealth.
Last year produced 85 proposals assuring
£82,291 and 64 for £53,441 were placed on
the books. The average of the business offer-
ing was unusually high, the rejected pro-
posals averaging over £lOOO apiece. How-
ever, the co. re-insured to the extent of
£20,750. Net premium income was £1405;
there were no claims, and exes, absorbed
only £503. The surplus, together with
interest earnings, has advanced the £20,006
assurance fund to £22,002.

This Flinders-lane softgoods business was
passed over to a public co. in 1912, and its
early career was very disappointing. For
its first six years disclosed results fell far
below prospectus anticipations; in fact, it
did little more than half as well as its pro-
moters had reckoned on. Either business
fell off badly, or the new crowd discovered
that everything was not as it seemed and
deemed a lot of patching necessary. How-
ever, for the 12 months to January, 1919,
very much improved results showed up, and
now, for the past year, disclosed profits are
given as 34 times the 1913-18 average.
Meantime, though, to finance heavy and
expensive stocks, paid capital has increased
almost 50 p.c. The co. did so very well
last year that after meeting all interest
charges on borrowed capital and paying 64
p.c. to the prefs. there was ample left to
give the ordinaries over 25 p.c. on their
greatly-increased capital. But conditions
have been so abnormal that prospects can-
not be measured by recent performances.
Despite very high prices, probably never in
their history have the Flinders-lane and
York-street houses had such a demand for
their goods. There has been a lull or two
when the retailer thought he saw chances
of a slide in prices, but he was soon dis-
illusioned when overseas quotes for new sea-
son’s goods soared higher and higher. The
wholesaler’s difficulty has not been to find
buyers, but to procure stocks. Judging by
the profits disclosed for the past two years
this co.’s London buyers have been fairly
successful in keeping pace with the demand.
Under these conditions profit-earning has
been very easy.
But the two factors which have made for
big figures lately cannot continue to domi-
nate the position. Probably years will
elapse before the world’s shortage of manu-
factures is made good and prices show much
inclination to tumble. So far as the Com-
monwealth is concerned, however, it is more
a question of how much longer its people
can afford to pay the very stiff prices de-
manded for overseas manufactures. The
very least that can be said of present trad-
ing conditions is that, being merely the
direct result of temporary devices to post-
pone the day of settlement of war troubles,
those conditions must collapse sooner or
later. How soon The Bulletin cannot
guess; for nobody can tell precisely when,
the artificial prosperity created by huge
war-loan spendings will begin to fray at
the edges. Probably it won’t be long after
the war-gratuity cash distributions have
been absorbed that many people will discover
that things are npt what they seemed. If
we experience a run of good seasons (which
should be due), and labor becomes reason-
able and gives our old and infant industries
a chance to help pay the war bill, the future
may be much easier than it looks on paper.
But the fact that the present abnormal con-
ditions are gradually coming to a close, and,
also, that with something like adequate pro-
tection, Australian industry should hence-
forth be given a big lift* the outlook for the big
importers like Beatii. Schiess and Felstead,
Ltd., is not over-bright. Possibly, as has
already happened in many instances, the
importer of to-day will become the manu-
facturer of to-morrow\ or at least he will
put some of his money into local factories.
Certainly it is too much to expect, that
profits on last year's scale will be pos-
sible. It is questionable whether cos. will be
permitted to make anything like 25 p.c. p.a.
on capital in future. With the Federal
Government looking round for every penny
it can lay hands on, the big-profits earner
i.s not being overlooked. In the Federal
lobbies there is discussion, now that the
War-time Profits Tax has lapsed, whether
a Peace-time Excess Profits Tax should not
take its place.
The £lOO.OOO of new ordinary capital got
in last year has given the R.. S. and F.
balance-sheet a much healthier appearance,
though the co. is still carrying a heavy load
of debt: —

Besides the -diabilities shown above there is
the £lOO,OOO of debentures. At January
31 last there was a surplus of more or less
liquid assets over liabilities of £354,080,
compared with £205,390 12 months ago.
Capital is made up of 100,000 04 p.c. cum.
prefs., and 220,000 ordinaries, both fully
paid to £l. Goodwill still stands in the
balance-sheet at £50,000, but as £94,484
of surplus profits have accumulated since
operations began, the whole capital is now
represented by tangible assets, with the
£44,484 shown in the first table to spare.

There are several features about the last two
leaves in that table which call for explana-
tions. To begin with, the profits for both
the past and previous years were even better
than shown by the figures, and they are
records. When the 1918 accounts were made
up £O5OO was clipped for a taxation reserve,
and that amount still stands intact in the
balance-sheet. Now a further £9400 goes the
same way, and since, presumably, all cur-
rent taxes are otherwise provided for, these
appropriations are set aside merely to meet
heavier calls in the future—a wise move,
for heavy taxation will be an infliction for
very many years, while there is no guarantee
that profit-earning will continue so easy as
it has been lately. The effect of the cut,
however, is to materially reduce recent
profits. Instead of net profits, as shown
in the table, giving a 20 p.c. return on capi-
tal, actually the year closed with visible
earnings equal to over 26 p.c. of capital.
The £25,000 shown as transferred to capital
is in actuality a 3s. 4d. special div. which
is being devoted to purchasing 50,000 new
£1 shares paid to 10s. and issued at par.
On allotment 10s. per share will be called
in. Paid capital will then stand at £200.000;
it is £150,000 at present. The new funds
are required chiefly for building extensions:
the Brisbane premises are to be recon-
structed, a new bulk store has been erected
at Newcastle, and additions are being made
to the Sydney store. The co. is now in its
20th year, and expansion has been very rapid
during the past ten years:—

Since 1914 the balance-sheet figures have
been built up without a penny of
new capital being got in, the £30,000 addi-
tion thereto being wholly capitalised
reserves. Since 1909 £45,318 of new capital
has been got in from shareholders and £1452
from share premiums. Meantime liabilities
have increased by £47,378. The book value
of assets during the same period has grown
by £168.288, so the 10 years have shown a
book improvement of over £74.000, only a
few hundreds short of the paid capital at
the commencement of the period. The past
five years have been especially fat, for over
£60,000 of the £74,000 improvement has been
effected since the war began, and divs. lately
have been mostly at the rate of 15 p.c.
instead of a former 10 p.c.

The Commonwealth Bank has for a good
while been considering the methods by which
it will expand in order to give the country
a better chance to use it; and the absorption
of private banks is most favored. It is
expected that the first transaction of the
kind will be announced within a week or
two. •
The great, placid A.M.P. Society is having
one of its rare earthquakes. From time that
goes back beyond the memory of man mem-
bership of the Boards, central and local,
has always been a matter of office nomina-
tion. Only once was there serious enough
opposition to put a man in whom the office
had not hall-marked: that was when old
Benjamin Short, one of the most successful
of the society’s canvassers, proved it by
winning a seat. Nominally, of course, the
policy-holders are supreme; but they have
to go to some trouble to use their vote; and
“the office” —a mysterious power—always
frowns upon it. Now. however, Alec Job-
son, a former clerk in the service and actu-
ary at the Melbourne office, has nominated;
and apparently satisfied that nothing can he
done without the help of the staff, he stands
as the friend of the big army of clerks and
agents and inspectors. This is probably
the beginning of a large movement. Thus
far the staffs of Australian mutual life
offices have had no direct representation on
the Boards ; yet there isn’t much doubt that
they could just about get control if they set
themselves out to do it. Meanwhile insur-
ance clerks in general have been whipped
up by Prof. Meredith Atkinson in Mel-
bourne, and, encouraged by the success of
the bank clerks, an application will be made
to register under the Arbitration law.

Slabs from a lengthy letter from public
accountant Alfred S. White, sec. pro tew. of
Australian Cash Orders, Ltd., concerning
the “Wild Cat’s” dissection (B. <S/4/’2O) of
that concern’s prospectus:—
First of all, let us deal with your most serious
allegation, viz.: “For every £1 put up, the share-
holder would get back only 10s. 7d.” Certainly
from your bare reading of our prospectus you bad
justification in making that statement; but the facts
materially alter the position. The Memorandum and
Articles of Association of our proposed co. pro-
vide that in the event of the co. being wound up
the right of the holders of “A” (vendors’) shares
to participate in the distribution of capital shall
be deferred until the “11” shareholders have received
20s. in the £.
“Where is Australian Cash Orders, Ltd., going to
find acceptors of its paper?” We have already
completed arrangements with over a dozen well-
known and reputable business houses, to say nothing
of dentists, opticians, etc. We say without fear of
contradiction that our list of retail houses is second
to none among possible competitors.
You say that “it is an impertinence to ask the
public to put up £21,000 before these arrangements,”
etc. Who asked the public for anything? They
have not been so fortunate as to receive any invi-
tation. The prospectus is marked “for private
circulation only,” and it has only been circulated
among the clients and friends of the vendors and
secretary pro tem. The fact that in about two brief
weeks they have practically subscribed the issue of
£21,000 is the best proof that they have appre-
ciated the opportunity which has been offered to
them.
“The latest Buckingham turnover was about
£120,000, but that necessitated book debts of about
£30,000.” We estimate on a turnover of £lOO,OOO,
which reduces the resulting book debts proportion-
ately to £25,000. Then, of these at least several
thousands are the accumulations of backward debtors
of the past several years and are not the result of
current business. By the time these accumulations find
their way on to our books we shall have set up
ample reserves to provide for them. What is more,
you have overlooked the fact that we shall always
have many thousands credit from the retailers, who
will only be settled with at periods averaging from
two to eight weeks from the time they cash our
orders. Hence it is obvious that £20,000 will be
sufficient to execute a considerably larger turnover
than £lOO,OOO p.a.
“No attempt has been made to anticipate profits
under normal conditions.” No; the estimation of
the prospects of the co. has been left to the good
sense of the people before whom the prospectus has
been placed. The fact that they have subscribed
the issue in double-quick time and without the aid
of a sharebroker shows that they have not been
slow to arrive at correct conclusions.
Our co. is being floated under much more auspi-
cious circumstances than the R. H. Gordon business
was commenced under, and our prospects are equally
bright.
To which the “Wild Cat” briefly replies:—
(1) A. S. White admits that the prospectus, so
far as it dealt with capital, was a worthless docu-
ment, and that this page’s comments were justi-
fied.
(2) It is now stated that “arrangements have
been made with a dozen well-known and reputable
business houses.” But the promoters sought capital
merely on the strength of vague arrangements “being
made”—which was quite another matter.
(3) That practically £21,000 was raised in a
couple of weeks, without the aid of a broker, counts
for nothing. Had a reputable broker been con-
sulted the foolish prospectus would never have ap-
peared. Certainly no reputable broker would have
attempted to offer his clients (as the prospectus
did) 10s. 7d. of t.-p. debts and office stationery and
furniture for each £1 invested. The rapidity
with which the money flowed in on the strength of

that prospectus merely shows how smooth is the
path of the co. promoter.
(4) In addition to the very small proportion of
bad debts disclosed by the Bucking-ham business,
it now seems that of the £30,000 outstanding (and
which this co. is to collect) there are “at least
several thousands of accumulations of backward
debtors of the past several years.” This throws a
new light, on the business. '
(5) The explanation concerning the security for
capital and the assurance that a trading connection
has been established, of course, puts Australian Cash
Orders, Ltd., in a much better light than did the
prospectus. But the claim that the co. starts
“under much more auspicious circumstances than the
It. H. Gordon business” is mere flam. Conditions
at present are quite abnormal, and the best of tip-
sters won’t guarantee the future. Time-payment
balances are not the best of security when nobody
knows what troubles may lie ahead. And, as The
Bulletin remarked last week, lucrative though the
cash-order business has been in the past, its pros-
pects are uncertain. In the intervening few days
a Labor Government has been installed, and since
it is out to reduce H.C.L., there are more un-
likely things than that the cash-order business,
which exacts high interest rates and also gets cuts
from retailers (necessitating increased prices there,
as the Interstate Commission was told by the re-
tailers themselves.), will be given some attention.
* * * *
The Technical Commission inquiring- into
the health of the metal miners of N. S.
Wales is proceeding- steadily with its job at
Broken Hill. Every worker on the line of
lode, whether above or below ground, is in-
vited to an exhaustive medical overhaul, in-
cluding an examination under X-rays, to
ascertain what ills can be directly traced to
the mines. So far over 1000 A.M.A. men
have been handled by the doctors.
Mt. Elliott (Q.) sustained a heavy loss
when mine-superintendent A. E. Strick
passed out with ’flu in the U.S. the other
day. He had crossed the Pacific to study
Sam’s latest copper methods. A Ballarat
School of Mines graduate, he had acquired
experience on many fields, and was one of
Elliott’s oldest officers.
Company promoters are still making big
money at Hampton Plains and Mt. Monger,
hut elsewhere in the West mining specula-
tion is dead. Most of the cash subscribed
lately lias been for shares in option cos. and
syndicates, and with few exceptions a large
portion has gone into the pockets of the
middlemen, leaving little, after paying the
deposit, for development, and nothing to
provide for the balance of purchase con-
sideration. These middlemen have not
found a penny to work the properties
acquired in this way. Yet in spite of this
and the fact that in practically all of the
ventures the vendors’ paid-up interest has
ranged from a tenth down to a fourth, the
public has rushed the shares. Even cos.
put on the market without reports, prospec-
tuses or particulars of share issues have
been over-subscribed in an hour or two.
Some cos. have been formed and shares
allotted without any Articles being registered
or any directors being appointed, in fact,
the Companies Act has been laughed at by
promoters. By and bye, when some soured
shareholder brings an action against a Board,
directors may discover to their cost their
liability under the Act.
* * * *
It is still impossible to give an accurate
forecast of the value of Hampton Plains.
S° fa l ' not a single ton of ore from the
field has been crushed, but five leases—the
Celebration, White Hope, Pernatty, Mutooroo
and Golden Hope—have been proved to eon-
tain payable ore down to a depth of from
;>oft. to 100 ft. Other holdings have pros-
pects, while others again must still be given
a chance. In regard to Mt. Monger, the
best of its promoter-puffed mines are mere
prospects.
Another Mt. Monger (W.A.) float projected is
the Waverley, fathered by such old hands as
Frank Rea, W. Scrymgour, ,T. Stewart and a
few of their pals. Terms with leaseholder Bill
Stearne are : £lOOO for a six months’ option,
£14,000 additional if the option is exercised,
and a tenth interest or its equivalent of
10,000 fully-paid shares. The promoters
get £O5OO cash and 9000 paids. The claim
is next door north of McCahon’s lease, and
the best that can be said of it to-day is that
the chloride formations in McCahon’s run
through it. Capital is to be £BO,OOO in 10s.
sharesj 95,000 are to be offered for subscrip-
tion, 25,000 paids go to vendors and 40,000 to
reserve, with the right to .the promoters to
take up at par 10,000 shares any time within
12 months.
Pernatty Central will probably be the king-
pin of the next big Hampton Plains float.
One scheme is to include it with several
surrounding blocks, together with two re-
served leases of the Hampton c-0., and mar-
ket the lot as one venture in London under
the auspices of Robinson and Clark. If this
fails, the three directors, who are all moneyed
men, have a scheme up their sleeves which
they claim will suit shareholders just as
well.
Edna Consolidated’s latest 12 months’
run might have been worse. It got £22.563
for gold, including £4585 from premiums.
Yet it drifted £3615 to the bad. This was
solely because of pumping troubles, as it had
to spend £6347 on that account as well as
nearly £6OO for law costs in connection with
pumping disputes. Had it not experienced
these troubles the co. would have had a little
surplus cash in hand. As it is there is
£2137 to set against debts of £2504. The co.
might have struggled along under the Edna
Central tribute agreement, but the whole
of the workings were too touchy to enter
from that mine. As Aldridge w r as a sick
man, Stuckey, of the Deeps, was called in.
His advice is to go east, where he claims is
the extension of the gneissic formation of
Westonia. In it, he says, another Edna
May may be concealed under the covering
of cement. That is pure conjecture, but to
gamble on the chance is far better than to
flutter hundreds for the right to enter a pas-
toral block at either Hampton Plains or Mt.
Monger. This can be said for the move:
under the same cement capping Aldridge
opened up a big shoot of fair grade ore, and
to the south in the greenstone the Golden
Point has a vein of pay dirt. A shilling or
two per share is to be shelled out to carry
on this desirable bit of prospecting. The
co. sought six months’ exemption the other
day and got three.
* * * *
Last year Gt. Boulder (W.A.) went back
20,000 tons in its ore reserves, and as things
are getting worse the board is frantic in
its eagerness to get hold of a new mine.
Many have been tried and found wanting,
but the other day one, the 0.K., at Norse-
man, was purchased. This show is on the
small side, but crushings have averaged up
to soz. per ton.
South Kalgurli (W.A.) has been getting
a bit of good ore lately in the north end of
the No. 13 level, and some stuff assaying up
to 2oz. in the southern portion of the No.
15 level workings. Although regarded for
years past as doomed, with sound manage-
ment this mine still has years of life ahead.
After having gambled for months with the
scrip of the flock which nested around the
Badak’s area at Jeneri Valley, Melbourne
punters are learning a first principle in min-
ing co. flotation: that it is as well to make
certain of the title to an area before gambling
on its mineral contents. Dickenson’s office
got in early with the Jeneri and Kedah
floats, and now it has to paste up the news
that the Kedah authorities decline to let the
Jeneri Valley be mopped up by a lot of Aus-
tralian pegging concerns. Dr. Ffrost, who
chairmans the Bux and Jungle, isn’t
definite whether those shows have a title or
not. Surely it was vital to have that little
point settled before a move was made to
jump from the syndicate to the co. stage?
But it looks incredible that, if the Jeneri
Valley is dense jungle, as avowed by Wilson
and Orton, men can go there to discover a
mine and will not be rewarded. Perhaps
when things sift out, the Badak will be
found to have got its land, or some of it,
and that the adjoining blocks will be open
for testing under special conditions.
Cap’n Teddy Miles on The Bulletin's
comments on his Badak challenge (B.
8/4/’2O) :
The firms making a specialty of boring would dress
down the sample to a marketable commodity before
sending it to the smelter. They know the difference
between iron and tin, and would not risk their pro-
fessional reputation by sending a 35 p.c. concentrate
to the smelters for assay. The question is how
much of the original sample will be left when it ts
reduced to a marketable commodity ? Taking as a
guide the smelters’ price ( £24 for 35 p.c. and £l7O
for 72 p.c.) the residue would appear to be about
one-seventli.
Well, the co. having got in its working capi-
tal, the opportunity will soon be afforded to
ascertain whether Badak stuff can be
dressed, a.s claimed, to over 70 p.c. by
ordinary methods, with a loss - of only about
1 p.c. of the tin. The Board has not yet
appointed a managing-engineer, hut is under-
stood to be still angling for Moline, of Ben-
digo Amalgamated. Possibly Dyason’s
absence in India on gold premium bus'ness
is holding up negotiations. No better man
than Moline could be put in charge. Old
Y-Water (N.S.W.) shareholders w T ill remem-
ber his performances on that show, when,
despite the allegations that the tin was too
.fine and too dirty to dress, he turned out
£46,000 of divs. in four years, with tin at
about £l5O per ton.
From Darwin: In consequence of a sup-
posed valuable tin find about 35 miles from
Pine Creek, a rush has taken place. The
towmship is now deserted. Chinese, wffiites
and blacks —all have left, except the mana-
ger of the State hotel. A prospector named
Jones claims to have obtained Mb. tin to
the dish. The locality of the find is near
the centre of a large tin-field, between the
heads of the Cullen and Ferguson rivers,
approximately 150 miles from Darwin. The
find also caused considerable excitement in
Darwin, and a number of unemployed are
making for Pine Creek.
* * «■ *
There’s a proposal on foot in the Northern
Territory for the Coronet Hill, Mt. Diamond
and Mt. Davis mines to join in putting up
a copper-smelting plant somewhere about
Mt. Coronet and 40 or 50 miles east of Pine
Creek. There are big bodies of ore, some
of . it mixed with arsenic, but it
won’t stand cartage, rail and shipping
freights to southern smelters. Fuel is one
of the worst troubles that a smelter out there
is likely to knock against. No one has dug
up any coal worth speaking of in the Terri-
tory yet, and the Newcastle coal which
Vestey's use costs them about £7 a ton bv the
time it gets to their furnaces, and they are
two miles, not 200, from Darwin. Charcoal
should, however, be fairly cheap. There
is plenty of limestone for flux near the old
Eveleen mine, and it is alleged to be sweet-
ened with small veins of silver-lead.
The little £15,000 co. to test old Milburn
Creek > copper-mine (N.S.W.) has been
floated. Capital asked from the public (250
shares of £2O each) was doubly subscribed,
and development is to commence almost im-
mediately.
* * * *
Jumbunna (Vic.) made a profit of £728
for six months under Federal Coal Board
control. No wonder Jimmy Boyd blows off
steam! Coastal shipping having dropped
back into the hands of the cos., the way
has been opened for a stiff advance in ship-
ping freights, which in the ordinary course
would mean dearer coal for Victoria. It
would be Boyd’s luck, however, if the Fair
Prices Commission steps in and deprives
him of the protection thus afforded his
pet industry. But Jumbunna never can
earn good profits until it can get a decent
output. Cost of labor and material have
aeroplaned, so that Jumbunna wants to
squeeze two years’ output into one in order
to thrive. But Gippsland coal seams are
mostly narrow, and, even where of decent
width, they are so faulted as to necessitate
re-grading of roads and workings, thus entail-
ing a lot of non-productive outgo. Last
half-year three faults were bumped into
and brought in water to trouble the manage-
ment. To locate fresh reserves boring is
going on in the northern area, the induce-
ment being that the faces worked out that
way are in good coal.

Speck Geologist Reid is doubtful if osmiri-
dium will ever be found payable in the
solid rock. In his recent report he remarks
that “the distribution of the metal is very
erratic; it is rarely found actually in the
rock (serpentine) mass. Usually it occurs
in the form of pockety aggregations distri-
buted unevenly along master joints in the
serpentine.” The only method of definitely
ascertaining the accuracy of that statement
would be by a bulk crushing and concentrat-
ing test, and present conditions do not make
it good business to try.

Briseis Central (Tas.) expects to make
a start with the construction of its large
dam by hydraulic appliances when the rainy
season begins. Work in connection with
the main race and flumes is well advanced.
The water is to be led on to the mine with
a pressure obtained from a COOft. drop in a
half-mile of pipes. A limited amount of
work was done on the deposit during the
past half-year, for a recovery of nearly If
ton of high-grade tin oxide. It is proposed
to rush the dead work, putting the mine on
the producing list as soon as possible.
* * * *
Hampden-Cloneurry (Q.) lately took an
option over the Koli-i-Noor leases, about
two miles from the Dobbyn, in the Mount
Cuthbert locality. Ore from the show
treated at the Hampden smelters averaged
well, and it seems to be plentiful. The shaft
is down 100 ft., and the co. has erected
headgear and plant to prospect a further
100 ft. The time of the option is eight
months and the price £lO,OOO.
Talisman Consolidated, the M.L. concern
which has produced well over two millions’
worth gold, and control of which was
shifted from London to Auckland a couple
of years ago, disappointed shareholders by
passing divs. during the last year. At the
annual meeting chairman A. W. Blanchard,
referring to the block of ore about 50ft.’
in length at No. 15 level, said a winze had
been sunk 129 ft. from the drive, and a
rise put up on this make carried good values
for about 80ft. and for about 60ft. laterally,
averaging £7 a ton; in sinking the winze
varying conditions of width and values pre-
vailed, the latter ranging from £8 down
to if- The ore carried sulphide veins of
the character that bad Seen such a great gold-
producer in the past, and it was still un-
known what volume and value -were in the
Resent zone. Boring to explore the reef
oOOft. below’ No. 15 level had been slow"
one bore in the Woodstock section had met
a strong reef with low’ values, but another
had. passed through some of the most pro-
mising country seen in the mine. Produc-
tion is suspended while boring and other
exploration work proceeds.

Scheelite mining in Otago (M.L.) revived
a good deal during the war, and a recent
discovery by Gallery and party, at Macrae’s
Flat, looks important and may help to
restore confidence in this old mining dis-
trict, which has been suffering a recovery
from the effects of the wild boom of 1912-13.
The majority of these scheelite shows are
in mica-schist rock, and are of small extent,
not persisting for any great length or depth.
Rich hand-picked ore is a feature, and
gold association another.
Ore-production at King Island Scheelite
runs on its even way, though the recovery
per ton crushed has dropped to p.c. tung-
stic acid. The ore is unique in that the
gangue rock is a garnet, making concentra-
tion somewhat difficult. The deposit con-
tinues to respond to development.

success. An ex-internee was presented on
information of the military charged with
having made “a statement likely to cause
disaffection among his Majesty’s subjects,”
namely, “that Commonwealth Ministers were
robbing the public of large sums of money.”

the immense sums of money Commonwealth
Ministers had “robbed” the public of by
mismanagement in the wool, wheat and other
deals, or had dipped hand over fist into t!
gold reserve, lie failed to explain. Techni-
cally he was right if the former matter was
in his mind, and a Civil Court may have
upheld his point of view had he based his
defence upon it. In any event he would
not have been sent to gaol. The novel
aspect of the case is that no Minister was
defamed, and if they thought they were col-
lectively, none of them had the courage to
take out a writ. To have applied the War
Precautions Act to clear their characters
ivas craven. A scandal about the appli-
cation of the Act has been the shameless
discrimination used. O. C. Beale and
Colonel Lassetter have said things much
more likely to disaffect the community, but
Hughes and the military assail them with
the ferocity of a dove.

“Albatross”: During the marine engineers'
strike Ilabaul was reduced to very short
rations. The staple food, beer, had long
since vanished. Gloom roosted in the garri-
sou. One day the glad
wireless news trickled
through of the depar-
ture of the relief ship
Induna from Sydney.
Everybody grew cheer-
ful in spite of short
rations. But the
anticipatory joy of
the garrison was short
lived, for when the
Induna arrived it was
found that she carried
merely foodstuffs!
Gloom took charge
again, and nobody
smiled until the Ma-
watta arrived with
fermented cheer. Even
then there was delay
in getting the beer
released by the
authorities. It was an
anxious time. The
officers’ and sergeants’
messes and the can-
teen had been as dry
as Pussyfoot Johnson
for weeks. Crowds
used to haunt the
jetty. Then one glad
day, when I was do-
ing my share of
haunting, 20 dozen of
beer was released for
the sergeants’ mess.
It was a sight to see.
There was no wild cheering, but soldiers
stood in line and saluted the beer as the
“boys” pushed it along on a trolley, while
civilians took their hats off and held them
reverently under then - arms until the pro-
cession passed.
“Spare Corp.”: The fortune of war is a
freak. Fritz was making things unpleasant
on the Hill 60 sector when, the news came
through that one of our lot was to go back
to Bailleul to link up with Corps lI.Q. The
Hun was pouring over gas-shells, and the
graveyard round the Bluff was filling up
fast; 90 men were caught in a single night.
Now and then Fritzie dropped in a long-
range compliment on the towns well back,
but there was still comfort and comparative
security there. As we watched the lucky
man go, we envied him. A few days later
a G.S. waggon-driver brought us the news.
Fritz shells had started to arrive in Bailleul?
and this driver had tried to get into a cellar,
but five men were already camped there, so
he had to push off. He was hardly clear when
a shell lobbed right into the place, and got
the five. The man we reckoned so lucky
in being returned to Corps H.Q. was one of
them.

A returned Digger nurse who got to that
rough sector where the Servians were keep-
ing up the struggle tells of her
amazement at being called upon
to perform midwifery duties for
one of the Serb “soldiers.” The
husband of the woman, a young
bride, had been killed, and the
girl had followed the example
of many other women of her
country, and got into uniform
to avenge his death. Exposure
and overstrain induced a pre-
mature birth. Probably she
would have served her country
better had she stayed out of the
turmoil and given her offspring
a chance of life, but the story
illustrates the frenzy of the war horror in
the Balkan section.

“No. 1 Section” on our giant trophy:—
Actually the first credit for the capture of the
big gun goes to the Air Force which stopped the
train, consisting of engine, gun, ammunition waggon,
workshop, etc., when already under steam. Still,
the gun was yet Fritz’s to blow up or seriously
damage, but as the tanks and armored cars were
about, and the invincible infantry, represented by
a party of the 31st Battalion with a few of the
Bth Field Co. attached, happened along to take
prisoner the C.O. and crew of the gun, this was
prevented. Even then the gun was not “captured,”
for it was in Hun territory well in advance of our
“Blue Line” —the limit of advance for the day,
back to which our troops returned, leaving the gun
to the tender mercies of the Hun. Fortunately Fritz
got no chance, as a party consisting of Lieut. Bur-
rows, M.C. (of the 14th Field Co., attached Bth
Field Co.) and Sappers Strachan, M.M., and Palmer,
M.M., went out and brought it back, under fire, as
far as the permanent way was left intact, a matter
of 4000 yards inside the Blue Line—fairly safe,
though still under the observation and fire of Fritz.
This performance was the real capture of the gun,
and indicates where the credit should go. It was
seriously mooted on our side that the gun should
be blown up, but as Sappers Strachan and Palmer
could drive a loco, they were given a chance to
save it, and they did. The saving was no easy
matter, as the engine and boiler were badly riddled
and leaking. It was only possible to get enough
steam to pull out the gun with ammunition and
workshop trucks, the carriages, some of which were

on Are, having lo be kicked off. At this stage
the gun was lying a little to the north-west of
Harbonnieres, and a party of Bth Field Co. sappers
was endeavoring to repair the railway track to get
the gun back into safety, a very difficult job with
the limited equipment of a Field Co. At length
the track was made good as far back as Bayonvillers,
and on the evening of August 9, a day after the
capture, water, a precious commodity, was carted
to fill the leaky boiler, fires were lit and the shaky
old smoke-stack began to- belch forth sparks and
smoke. Fritz had been keeping his eye on his won-
derful gun, and his limited artillery was playing
regularly around it, and aeroplanes dropped bombs.
However, sufficient steam was raised to bring the
gun safely into Bayonvillers, when Sappers Strachan
and Palmer discovered that there was a fraction
of. water left in the boilers, and a big fire up. The
engine was moved well away from the train, and
just when it was expected to go up a party of the
4th Army Railway Co. arrived with two tanks of
water on motor lorries and saved the engine. They
were headed by a very self-confident Tommy “officah”
saying he had come to “take over”! A week or so
after I saw that gun, and it was labelled “Captured
by the Fourth Army.” It had been “taken over” !

Billjim hasn’t ceased to be resourceful
because lie has put on civvies. An ex-
sergeant who applied for a bit of land was
informed that it was within a town bound-
ary, and therefore unavailable. Ilis reply
to the Minister was instant: “Have the
boundary altered; you’re the boss.’’
“Dad”: My complaint about these Baby
Week enthusiasts is that they mostly flay
the air, neglecting the thousand practical
reforms they might work at. For instance,
I’ve just been to town and had my two
babies with me. In the dining-room at Syd-
ney railway-station, though the children had
only a shilling's worth each at menu rates,
they were charged full fares; and a protest
to the sub-manager produced no satisfaction.
The same at Penrith. In a community
which really wanted babies the people who
had them wouldn't be penalised by the State
in this way.

From under the Bar table:—
In the Sydney District Court last week Josephine
Krieger got £2O out of a hairdresser whose stain
had turned her “front” a vivid green. The verdict
was against the weight of the evidence, in a sense.
The proprietress of the dye and William Hamlet,
the Government analyst, both testified that the drugs
employed couldn’t have produced the horrible effects
complained of; and there was only plaintiff’s word
to show they had. But possibly the Judge felt that
he couldn’t be too careful on such an issue. Con-
trary to general opinion, vanity is not the motive
force with many of the dyed division, but a pathetic
desire to get or hang on to a job. In the more
poorly-paid callings grey hairs are a fatal bar. So it
would be a tragic thing for an ageing shop-assistant
or waiter to turn up at his place of employment one
day with a green or blue head of hair. On the
other hand, this judgment—though it dealt with a
dispute which was obviously bona fide on both sides
—opens up a long vista of actions along the lines of
those brought in all the States of recent years
against pie-vendors. It is easier to fake hair or
hair-dyes than it is to put rats in pies; and the
renovators are likely to suffer proportionately.

“Karim Khan”: Those of us who were
doing our bit on the outskirts of the trouble
with the Turk met some fine examples of
what they call “Oriental courtesy.” on<>
noon I received the following letter, all
about a horse, from Malik Mahomed Khan,
leader of the JViondumi Kurds:—
Greetings! I pray to Allah that you are well
Day and night I wish you happiness. From my heart
I am your true friend and servant. Now my com-

bears this. Be so kind as to give it to him. Bv
complying you will do yourself a great honor in m'v

of friendship will be strengthened.
I looked up the crock, handed it over and
received a second-hand blessing from Allah.

“T.P.”: Now and again th-e press reports
marvellous school attendances of children.
From Mary, aged 15, to toddling Jimmy, five
years young, “not a single day has been
missed,” etc., etc. As a teacher of half a
century standing, I want to protest against
the whole stupid, dangerous business. When
I was a callow youth, a white-faced, pitiful,
shivering 14-year-old girl burst into my
schoolroom, just before roll-call, crying,
“Please, I am ill! Please, mum sent me
to get my mark! Please, I have attended
nine years every day”—and fell fainting to
the floor. I have never forgotten that.
How many days off during nine years does
the average set man with no functional
changes take? Why? Because he knows lie
will gain by a day or so in bed. Yet the
same man will allow his pallid daughter or
sickly son to be forced to school, day in,
day out, in order to win a worthless Depart-
mental certificate. Teachers in harness
should say honestly what they feel over
this scandal.

a cheaper block of land. When Charles
Strong and the Scots Church in Collins-
street parted company on a question of doc-
trine over 30 years ago, his friends, admirers,
disciples or whatever they were joined with
him in starting the new tabernacle. The
doctor is such a gentle shepherd that it
is hard nowadays to believe that he stood
up so valiantly to the solid Kirk phalanx
in the late ’eighties.

“Henry Clay”: I had been living in the
Jordan Valley three blistering months when
the C.O. bundled me off to Divisional lI.Q.
at the double. It was afternoon teatime at
No. 2 mess when I poked my head in, and
a lisping red-tab invited me to enter, state
my business and sit down. I wanted to
see the A.Q.M.S. He was expected back
any minute. Would
I care for a drink?
Would I care for
tea? Beer, whisky
and soda? My
tongue remained
stuck to the mud
on my palate, but
I managed to
whisper “B e e r,
please!” “Beer,
certainly! Stuart.”
he called,, “bring
in a bottle of beer
and some glasses.”
Stuart duly
arrived with the
beer and equip-
ment and Red Tab
did the honors. He
poured out two
glasses of nectar,
and just as I
reached out to get
a hold on mine
before I woke up
he leaned across
the table and
remarked that the
beer looked fiat.
“By gad, it is
flat!” he said, and
with that he tossed
it out into the hot
white dust, where
it fizzled like water on a stove. I have
never really recovered from that shock;
for the tragedy remained even though pre-
sently he refilled my glass with frothy beer
from another bottle.

“10-2-4” on the Army Touch :
When I got back to Australia, a year ago, I
hastened to resign mv commission in the C.M.F.
“No more soldiering for me,” I murmured, as I
staled and stamped the document. A couple of
months passed, and I then got a sharp communica-
tion from Victoria Barracks drawing my attention
to District Order No. 0010, of 3/4/1872, which
requires every G.M.F. officer to supply his address
to the authorities annually or oftener. Failure
might cause the forfeiture of the officer’s commis-
sion. I replied by return that the authorities, had
been supplied with my address (as evidenced by the
■delivery of-their letter), and that I had resigned my
commission. I concluded by resigning it again.
There was another period of silence, broken event-
ually by a complaint that I had not forwarded the
certificate of physical fitness required by the Regula-
tions in the case of every C.M.F. officer. I was
instructed to attend to the matter at once. Failing
compliance my appointment might be terminated
without further notice. I replied that I had been
discharged from the A.I.F. as “permanently unfit.’’
As for the C.M.F. comnjission, I again resigned it;
and, by way of sheeting home the irrevocableness of
the step, mentioned that I had given away my
uniform to a gardener, and sold my F.S. boots
and spurs to a visiting old-clo’ man.
The following month I got a curt, soldierly inti-
mation from the Adjutant of an A.F.A. brigade that
I had been posted as O.C. of a battery. The
adjutant happened to be an old A.I.F. friend. I
wrote him a long letter. I explained everything—
my unfitness, my lack of a uniform and my deter-
mination never to spend a farthing on another. I
even gave him the address of the gardener who had
my old uniform. There was no reply.
A large envelope arrived this morning. It con-
tained an ornate message from the Governor-General.
In the left-hand corner was the phrase: “Australia
to Wit.” Underneath were my name and the word
“Greeting.” Below was Senator Pearce’s signature
in purple ink. Accompanying it was a type-written
communication from the old spot as follows:
“Herewith your commission as second-lieutenant in
the Commonwealth Military Forces.
“Kindly acknowledge receipt by return post.
“Your attention is directed to the following
District Order, No. 0340, of 29/10/1865, which
reads,” etc., etc.
I have resigned again, but I don’t suppose it will
do any good.

In connection with the Prince’s visit Tas-

then send it on to another State. Already

“8.C.”: We all had “windy” moments
over there, but Bill had a cyclone. The
Camel Corps was returning to the Jordan
bridgehead from the disastrous Amman
raid, when a flight of Taubes was sighted.
Soon it became apparent that the Hooshta
Brigade was to be the target, and there was
a general exodus from Bill’s vicinity. For
Bill was leading the “demolition pack.” a
camel laden with two hundredweight of
dynamite, guncotton and accessories.

"The climate doesn't

you please you'll find me costumed to

“Sure thing! Think we’re like to have a
heat-wave soon?"
Barraking his own mount and tying him
head-to-leg was an easy job ; but the camel,
excited by the din of bursting bombs and the
movement of other animals, played Hades.
Pulling at the head-rone and making a noise
like .steam escaping failed to put the brute
upon its belly and allow Bill to escape from
the horror. After step-dancing itself into
fury, the animal swung Bill about the land-
scape to receive threats of sudden death
from scared Diggers when the apparition
made towards them. “Gawd,” said Bill, as
he quietened the brute after the Huns
had finished their pleasantries. “I got so
close to it that I ’eard the angels talkin’.”
Ex-Dig.” : One of the most curious cases
of nerve-failure in the A.I.F. was that of
the man who, recommended for the V.C. for
his conduct in one stunt, dodged out of the
line shortly afterwards and was court-
martialled for cowardice. Of course he lost
his decoration. The V.C. had .spoiled his
nerve. He was a young man, a mere boy ; and
the desire to get the ribbon
on his breast and swank
with it for a while com-
pletely got him down. He
began to reckon the chances
of meeting a stray bit of
shell or bullet, and so got to
fear them. Finally he
simply ran for it.

“Fax”: Melbourne’s wowser parsons are
strangely silent in the presence of free
orchestral concerts at the Town Hall on
Sunday evenings. Years ago the Wirths
opened their skating-rink on the Sabbath
to a fine professional orchestra, but the par-
sons protested against the innovation, as
they had protested against educational p
ture-shows, or illustrated lectures, or any
sort of Sunday entertainment that asked a
silver coin of the people who rushed it. Now
they are up against free municipal concerts,
and they are dumb. Their muteness can
be felt. It cannot be that the majesty of
mayoralty appals them, or that the mighti-
ness of the music strikes them stiff. The
orchestra of old talked in a lofty strain;
yet the Sabbatarians interrupted its dis-
course with groans. There can be only one
explanation: the disappearance of the pro-
test must be due to the absence of a charge
for admission. No plates are protruded at
the doors, no thrums and saxpences are
exacted from the congregation; there is no
intrusion upon the churches’ prerogative of
taking up whatever small silver can be col-
lected on the Seventh Day. Therefore the
evangelical conscience is not shocked. But
as soon as concert management enters into
business competition with the church choir,
the silence will be broken. It isn’t the
entertainment that matters: it is the money.

Michael Mulligatawny”: For “Private
Centpercent” (B. 8/4/’2O) to characterise
as “anti-Semitic frenzy” the comments of
“0.8. E.” is ridiculous. The writer hais
no prejudice against Jews; in fact, his
inclination is all the other way. But national
safety demands that we should know where
our strength and weakness lie. Let “Pri-
vate Centpercent” scan the subscription-lists
of the patriotic and soldiers-help organisa-
tions, and he will see how few of his race
figure in any of them, notwithstanding their
unparalleled prosperity. Let him ask any-
one who was. identified with the work of
conscription-tribunals, and he will obtain
illuminating accounts of the ingenious arti-
fices adopted by Jews to evade any form
of military service. Even when a Jewish
battalion (38th Royal Fusiliers) was formed
at the end of 1917 for service in Palestine
only, no Jewish officer was available to
command. Eventually, with characteristic
incongruity, an Irishman, Lt.-Col. Patter-
son, was chosen. Some Jews have rendered
conspicuous service in the war, notably
Monash and Reading. The latter’s service
in the diplomatic sphere has been inestim-
able. But Jewry cannot rest on the laurels
gained by these two.
“O. Blin”: That the world cries for a
collapsible golf-stick which -gjill telescope and
go into the vest pocket when unemployed
was impressed upon me by the Easter rush
at Spencer-street. There were many forms
of luggage in- sight that day, but nothing was
more exasperating than a bag of golf-sticks
held by a long, angry man who tried to
work the implements through the press and
only succeeded in getting it mixed with legs,
suit-cases and a large bird-cage owned by
a female with ruby hair. As his property
threatened to disappear, the sportsman
wrenched it violently backward and upward
and drove the business ends of three clubs
through his neighbor’s scarlet thatch, upset-
ting its architecture and knocking off her
hat. There was a terrible outcry from the
victim and wild apologies from the golfer,
but amid the uproar I heard a mild little
man remark to the offender: “No wonder
you can’t get on. You’ve got too many
irons in the fire, old man.” But I noticed
that he didn’t let the lady hear him.
“John Dishragge”: Besides giving some
women delicious thrills these domestic shoot-
ing tragedies are keeping them supplied with
anticipations that they wouldn’t lose for
worlds. Last night I was standing on the
balcony watching the profiteer who lives op-
posite messing about with his
car. Suddenly there was a
blow-out. I was just rejoicing
silently when I heard our lady-
helpless pounding upstairs.
She and the wife met on the
landing. “Hear that shot?”
she gasped. “It’s happened at
last! You know, those people
next door —the little fair-haired
woman and the man who
drinks; I heard them at: it this
morning and he went off in a
terrible rage. I hope they hang
the brute. But of course they
won’t —all the murderers are
getting off now. It’s because
these men sympathise with one
another! I wouldn’t be mar-
ried now a d ay s, not fo r
worlds!” Just then the mur-
derer and his victim swooped
into song in that mournful duet
“When the Winds Come in from
the Sea.” They always do it when they arc
particularly good friends. Rut our lady-
helpless didn’t lose heart. “Never mind,”
she consoled us—“you just wait and see!”

“Ilamer”: The Board of Food Control
established the National Kitchen in Britain,
and Sydney is going to have something on
the same lines. The State Government was
asked to take action, but, as it failed, the
Housewives’ Association is plunging into
No. 1 Communal Kitchen in Oxford-street,
Sydney. By buying wholesale, the English
kitchens cut out so much middleman that
after paying all expenses they supply well-
cooked goods cheaper than the raw materials
can be purchased by the individual citizen;
and in the bed-sitting-room-kitchens of the
’Loo and Surry Hills, and on the balconies
which are sometimes turned into cooking-

SHIPS OF AIR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As far above the crests of green, tall trees,
Like wings of dreams I saw the sky-ships go,
And felt upon my face old memories
Of Europe and red Asia downward blow
I'rom the deep throbbing of the storied bird
That first across the world its song bad sung,
I turned, much moved, to earth and scarcely stirred
To see how at my side a child outflung
His little tender hand, and waved farewell.
His eyes upon the fading speck were bright.
His little voice, as soft as some flower tell,
Said, “I shall make a ship this very night,
And sail, and sail away”—with a wise nod.
I pressed his hand and smiled. How his eyes shone !
Oh, precious fingers soon to work for God, *
Man soars and fades, but these still follow on !

Another of the members of the New Aus-
tralia expedition which went looking for
Pai’adise in Paraguay 30 years ago has
just drifted back to the land that is best.
She was one of the Thomas family, and
married a son of one of the othei\ settlers,
named Butler.
When the war
broke out her
husband ’listed
in the A.1.F.,
and she took
her family to
England. Now,
returning by a
troopship, she
has introduced
to their own
own country five
Australians born
in exile.
GRAYNDLER ,
General Secre-
tary of the
A.W.U.
Lieut.-Gov. Edward Stone, of Westralia,
who died on Good Friday at 76, was a native
of Perth, and a son of the Swan River
.settlement’s first Attorney-General. His
mother was a daughter of Lieut. Whitfield, a
British army-officer, w r ho came to take up
land in the Swan country; and Stone was
connected with the pioneering Henty brother-
hood, of Victoria, by the marriage of another
"Whitfield daughter with the late John Henty.
At 21 Stone was admitted to the Bar at
Perth, and five years later became clerk to
the Leg. Council. In 1879 he was appointed
Acting Attorney-General, and in the follow-
ing year entered the Leg. Council as the
nominee of his pal Governor Robinson.
After that he was successively Acting C.-J.
(1881), Grown Solicitor (1882), acting
puisne judge (1S83), Supreme Court judge
(1884), and C.-J. (1901). In 1906 he left
the Bench. Stone married a sister of
George Shenton, and in his lively youth
caused great joy to all parties by battling
with his brother-in-law for the chairmanship
of the Perth City Council. A daughter mar-
ried Norman Ewing, the Perth solicitor who
afterwards became a Judge in Tasmania and
has lately been finding out things about the
Territory.
The retirement of T. J. Ryan, the defeat
of W. A. Holman and the death of A. H.
Peake has elevated Lee, of the Speck, to
the rank of senior Australian State Pre-
mier. Lawson (Vic.) and Mitchell (W.A.)
come next. In the matter of years Barwell
(S.A.) is the infant: he is two years younger
than Lawson.
N. S. Wales has had its layman-Attorney-
General, too. Saxe Bannister, its first, ap-
pointed in 1824, was an ex-Army officer and
not a lawyer. Dr. Wardell tw’itted him so
in court and out of it that a duel resulted.
The meeting was, however, bloodless.
Having grown bored with supplying the
Australian public with novels, verses and
authoritative opinions on subjects ranging
from the latest European stage success to
the remedy for Australia’s industrial unrest,
Harrison Owen has withdrawn his ill-gotten
gains from the bank and is off to London.
Among other things he leaves a job as
theatrical critic of the Melbourne Herald,
and, after congratulating him warmly, his
brother-scribes are preparing to dash in on
some of his free-lance space elsewhere. As
a topical and light versifier he has annoyed
them with his ease and fertility, while he
is not nearly as popular with the mummers
as any really considerate critic would he.
Ijondon letters to newspapers in various
capitals will occupy some of his time abroad.
“Heck”: “Expert Too’s” yarn (B.
25/3/’2O) of a father who, when his son’s
thumb was bitten by a snake, blew the
injured flesh away with his gun recalls the
adventure of young Borella. He was duck-
shooting down the Murray and was assaulted
on the tip of the finger by a poison-monger.
Borella put the member to the muzzle of
his gun and fired. The charge dispersed
only one side of the finger, whereupon the
youth stuck the target up again and settled
the job with the second barrel. Those who
remembered the incident were not much sur-
prised when word flashed through that he
had won a V.O. I last saw his name in
print when he was reported to have given evi-
dence before Judge Ewing that the authori-
ties at Darwin tried to gaol him when he
wanted to enlist!
Captain A. F. Hardy, who died at Gis-
borne (M.L.) lately, was a grandson of
“Kiss-me Hardy,” of Trafalgar. The Cap-
tain fought in the Maori War. He lived to
be 80.
Died in Victoria, one of the oldest mem-
bers of the old State Military Forces,
Colonel A. E. Otter, aged 84. He raised
and commanded the Vic. Scottish Regiment,
and was also in command of the sth Vic-
torian contingent that west Boer-hunting.
Newton, of Carpentaria, is off to the Lam-
beth Conference, too. This bishop, who put
in about 17 years in New Guinea before
accepting the gaiters which he seldom wears,
has one of the most interesting and cosmo-
politan dioceses in the world. Having about
700,000 square miles of Northern Australia
to roam over he does not want for elbow-
room, and his scattered flock is made up of
every race and color. It is only at long
intervals that he is to be found at home at
Thursday Island, his last tour eating up six
or seven months; and trips by lugger or
cutter round the Torres Strait islands up
towards New Guinea scarcely count. Dur-
ing the recent ’flu outbreak at Thursday
Island he turned his residence into a hospi-
tal, and, rolling up his sleeves, he cooked
for the patients, as well as directing a hos-
pital for the colored boys.
There were 14 V.G.-winners on view in
the Melbourne Exhibition Building one
night, and they were Worth looking at.
“Ginger for pluck” is alleged to be a good
working motto. But the only man with
brown to reddish hair was Sergeant Howell;
the thatches of all the others were black,
and in all but two or three cases jet black.
Lieut. McCarthy, who is a farmer from
York (W.A.), and who had his wife with
him on the platform, has a crop as black
as midnight in a coal-miije. This is the
man whom the English papers called the
Super-V.C. He is broad across the chest,
with an open face, rather wide mouth and
keen, good-humored eyes. You might set
him down as a good-natured dare-devil hut
for the swift sasracity of the look when he
turns his head. The juvenile Carroll, who
swung a pick and shovel before he went out
to win his V.C., has the map of Ireland
on his face and a shock of raven-black hair
on his head. Two or three of them —not-
ably Hamilton. Cartwright and Dwyer—
would have done Ouida nicely for her
Guardsmen parts.
Concerning two neighbors:—
Two of the biggest shipping men in the Com-
monwealth live near each other just outside Parra-
matta, and they provide all sorts of contrast. James
Burns owns Gowan Brae, a huge, old-fashioned place
overlooking the town on* the Pennant Hills side.
Owen Cox lives at Castle Hill in a mansion modern
from roof to cellar, with every device known to
20th century comfort-specialists. James Burns walks
from Parramatta station to his home. Owen Cox
never walks a yard if he can ride. Incidentally,
the Scotsman is never ill, while the Welshman is
never really well. Cox has telephones installed all
over his country home, and messages and cables
reach him at all hours of the day and night. From
the moment Burns enters his front gate no one
is allowed to talk business to him. The news of
the loss of half his company’s fleet would be with-
held from him under his own Medic rules till next
day. James Burns is of the stern Presbyterian
brand: there is nothing of the devotee about Owen
Cox. Burns lives 6imply: Cox is probably the most
accomplished sybarite in Australia. As a provider
of exquisite food and wonderful wines there is no
one else in his class. Burns is first favorite for
one of the baronetcies which are to be handed out
in connection with the Prince’s visit. His public
gifts have been immense. Cox wants no more than
the K.B.E. which he already has. He has no heir
to succeed to an hereditary handle.
Ross Smith did his best to make good with
holy Adelaide. He pointed out that ordinary
man is only a little below the angels and
that the aeronaut is doing his utmost to
diminish the difference.
G. McGirr, the wealthy member of the
crowd, was the first man tipped as Minister
of Health in the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment —this by reason of his experience as
a chemist. In years gone by he ran a
good jog-trot business in a country town, and
then he made his first notable rise by invent-
ing a rabbit poison. It was the most un-
healthy thing the local rabbit had struck.
MAJOR-GENERAL SELL HEIM,
the new Adjutant-Gen. of the Common-
wealth Forces.
Graham King, Pearce’s messenger, who
was one of the manage on the Minister’s
European tour, has died in Melbourne. Many
an elderly lady who called at the barracks
and interviewed him left quite content that
she had seen the Great Man himself.
Robert Hocking, Thursday Island pearler,
who has been given an 0.8. E. for services
to the Navy at Thursday Island, deserved a
better fate. He did some remarkable scout-
ing and intelligence work all about the
islands during the war. Incidentally, he
has the world’s finest collection of shells and
other odds and ends from Torres Strait, the
New Guinea coasts and the adjoining waters.
A tendency to Johnsonese —the language
that the doctor-dictionary-maker threw at
Boswell —characterises N.S.W. Premier
Storey. When the Governor “intimated” to
him that a Cabinet might be a handy thing
to have about and asked him for one. “I
replied.” said John, “in the affirmative.” A
more informal or baser man might have said
“Yep.” As to his policy: “My Government
....will take every opportunity of examin-
ing those measures which we think are
urgently necessary and which will give
relief to those whom we wish to benefit.”
These heavy but first-class remarks would
grace any tract.
In the recent Sydney brood of newly-
fledged “meds.” is one with a record wbieb
can never be beaten. He has taken first
place in every year, and carried off nearlv
every scholarship.
Before he was
through he had
written a treatise
on neurology which
was eagerly bought
up by his fellow-
students- The
climax came when
he coached men in
fifth-year work,
while he himself
was * doing fourth-
year. He is only
23, but evidently
Prof.- “Jimmy” Wil-
son doesn’t worry
about that, because,
he has appointed
him to be a lec-
turer. His name is
J. Irvine Hunter.
W. H. LEE, who
through Holman's
defeat and Peake's
death, has just
become senior
State Premier of
Australia.
Mrs. Henrietta Maria Smith, alleged to
be Perth’s oldest continuous resident, died
the other day at 05. She arrived at Fre-
mantle in 1831 with her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. John Gresswell, who came from Lon-
don in their own boat, a yacht of 90 tons.
In ’42 Henrietta married Bernard Smith,
founder of the Perth Building Society and
its secretary up to the time of his death.
They had 12 children, and their descendants
run into the fifth generation.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Jowett, long champion interjcctor in the House
of Reps., has abdicated in favor of Moses Gabb,
the new member for Angas (S.A.). Indeed, Hansard
is beginning to suspect that Gabb is really making a
serial speech, and that the others who catch the
Speaker’s eye are merely interrupting. The unusual
thing about Gabb is that he is not prevented from
chipping in by any sense of his unimportance, or
by any respect for the celebrity who may be spout-
ing, He fires his badinage at old and young, Min-
isters and privates, and without the slightest com-
punction will help a modest colleague to make a
speech. Within a few hours he was the prize joke
of the House: within a few weeks he has become
its prize bore.
When local spruikers were defying the
law by holding unauthorised political meet-
ings in the park (for which several have
been fined 55.), there was much bombastic
talk as to what the stalwart Brookfield would
do when he arrived in Broken Hill. He
would show these petty tyrants that the
People were going to do as they liked in the
People’s park. It was curious that every
time this threat was used in the presence of
Jabez Wright he shuddered. It was not because
Jabez entertained any kindly feeling for his ex-
Parliamentary colleague that he became
visibly affected at the prospect of Percy
breaking the law. On the contrary, Jabez’s
crowd and Percy’s following exhausted the
unexpurgated Diggers’ dictionary in their
allusions to each other. The explanation
was a simple matter of £s. d. Some months
ago Percival was ordered to find a surety for
his good behavior to the extent of £5OO.
Jabez was the surety. But Percival was
merciful and didn’t venture on to the for-
bidden ground, so his new enemy’s and old
friend’s £5OO wasn’t estreated.
Capt. Brewis, who piloted the first convoy
of troopships to Egypt, and later served as
Naval Transport Officer in Melbourne, has
been appointed District Naval Officer for
Victoria. He first came under notice when
he was chosen from numerous applicants to
select the sites for lighthouses around the
Australian coast in 19il—a job he did well.
Before that date he was a pukka British
navigating officer. Since then he has become
a dinkum Aussie.
Lawyer Rupert de Courcey Wilks is the
lay member of the new medical committee
of the Vic. Public Health Commission, and
he is thereby rewarded for a long, fagging
pursuit of the Riberal ideal. Wilks is a
Malvern councillor, and has spent a lot of
time helping Norman Bayles retain the
Toornk seat and keeping tab on Federal elec-
tors for Boyd, recently displaced by Francis,
M.H.R. for Henty. Wilks, with his lean
and pallid countenance peering continually
from behind the local pillars of Con-
servatism, has always cut a pathetic figure
in public affairs; but his appointment to
the Health Commission job should give him
a chance to cultivate a full, round Liberal
jowl at last.
For the special benefit of Governors The
Bulletin has dug up- the fact that William
Ashton, who laid the foundation stone of
old St. David's. Hobart, in 1817, was hanged
at Launceston in 1829 for robbery and bush-
ranging.

BAFFLING THE BOLSHEVIKS: OR MILITARISM
MANICURED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“London, Fridav night.—Sergeant-Major Gray, of
Richmond, Melbourne, has returned from Russia,
after thrilling: adventures on all the fighting fronts.
On many occasions he with difliculty escaped detec-
tion. His carefully manicured nails aroused sus-
picion, but his sound knowledge of the Russian
language put the Bolsheviks off the scent.”— Cable.
However strenuous the march, however fierce the
fray,
The nails, the peerless filbert nails, of Sergeant-
Major Gray
Were neat and trim.
No grime for him
Where grime too often lurks!
lie kept them filed
Through horrors piled.
Czechs, Bulgars, Huns and Turks
Knew all about, bis cuticles and envied, day by day,
The milk-white paws and pointed claws of Sergeant-
Major Gray.
His manicuring instruments were with him on that
beach
Where Abdul’s angry shrapnel failed the Anzacs’
ranks to breach ;
And as he stood
In field or wood
Attending to his gun,
While bullets screamed
His fingers gleamed
Like jewels in the sun.
The polish that he used was famed from Nieuport
dowh to Bray;
The matchless shine, the stain divine of Sergeant-
Major Gray.
But when he reached the Russian front things
altered for the worse.
The Bolsheviks dislike clean hands and clippers
make them curse.
Nail-scraping tricks
With orange-sticks
Inflame their hatred hot.
They use no soap....
AVhat earthly hope
Had Gray in such a spot?
He put his manicuring set regretfully away,
And hid from sight his fingers white, did Sergeant-
Major Gray.
And here, although hard-pressed at times, he was
successful quite.
No Bolsheviks contrived his all too perfect hands to
sight.
They peered and pried
And closely eyed
His digits during talks:
They strove to see
His nails when he
Went out with them for walks.
They crashed because at pulling legs he has the
same deft way
That never fails him with his nails. Cute Sergeant-
Major Gray!

“M.B.’s” snapshot of a likely President: —
Major-General Leonard Wood, so the cable tells us,
has been given leave of absence from the army
to conduct his campaign as a candidate for the
Presidency of the United States. Wood is not a
“fighting” soldier. His branch was the medical.
He was, until the war, the senior officer of the
U.S.A. Army. But he has, by his superior mental
force, become famous in other branches of the mili-
tary art. It was he who was responsible for the
Plattsburg idea. He was the first to advocate train-
ing-camps for civilians who could be turned into
officers. He was mainly responsible for the Military
Training Bill. His is the most wonderful memory
1 ever came in contact with. As a privileged visitor
I watched him during the Senate inquiry on the
Bill for Military Training, continued through
January, 1917. Wood had been recalled for exam-
ination by Senator Blair-Lee, of Maryland, who began.
his cross-examination by referring to a report that
witness had sent to the Army Dept, in June, 191 C
(it referred to mobilisation against Mexico). Wood
replied: “Oh, no, sir, the report I sent was on the
day after that, and is in the report on page 153.”
He seemed to have read everything and to remember
everything. Though his private secretary was there
during the examination, only in one case did he
refer to him. Not a solitary note or paper did he
look at to answer the unending series of questions.
A contrast to the next witness, Hugh L. Scott,
at that time chief of the staff of the U.S. Army.
The latter had to ask his private secretary for nearly
all the information required. Wood is the darling
of the Republican party, and is likely to be its
candidate. The only serious opponents he may have
are Governor Lowden (Illinois), Hoover (formerly
of Australia), and Hiram Johnson (California).
Lowden has a meritorious career, but was against
Roosevelt when the Taft-Roosevelt quarrel occurred.
Johnson was a Roosevelt Progressive, and Hoover
needs no other recommendation than his work during
the war. The final consideration will be the his-
torical fact that the LT.S.A. has invariably elected
a soldier as President at the conclusion of a war—
recall George Washington and Ulysses Grant.
A belated George Reid story, told by the
head of a Melbourne family whose eldest
daughter, then a beautiful flapper, met
George at the house of a mutual acquaint-
ance. George spread
himself to be nice
to the loveliest girl
he had met in Mel-
bourne, an d at
dinner had her at
his elbow. Pres-
ently the gir 1,
moved by some-
thing that had been
said, remarked art-
-less 1 y : “Oh, I
didn’t know you
were a well-known
man !” Geo r g e
sighed. “No. dear
young lady,” he
replied, “I’m not a
well-known m a n
since you do not
know me.”
WALTER
KINGSMILL,
bushman and
politician of
Westralia.
“Dolphin” goes back 70 years:—
William O’Hanlon, who died in Melbourne last
year, was possibly the last of those Australian
Argonauts who crossed the Pacific to joint the
forty-niners in California—unless one or two of
those who did not return yet linger in America.
There is a picturesque chapter in Australian history
yet to be written about that rush to California
which immediately preceded and has, from our
point of view, been quite overshadowed by the
golden age in Australia itself. There is, indeed, an
intimate connection between the two things, for
Edward Hargreaves, who was the first to give what
may be called a public demonstration of the pos-
sibilities of gold-digging in Australia, was one of
those Australians who learnt to dig in California.
And on all the early diggings, from Lambing Flat
to Ballarat, were Australians who had returned from
America, reinforced, as the fame of Ballarat, Mount
Alexander and Bendigo eclipsed that of the “placer"
diggings of the Pacific Slope, by many real Ameri-
cans, such as the group which gave its name to
California Gully. This was but the backwash of
the current which for two years or more set so
strongly in the other direction. How strong it
was is shown by a study of the shipping lists for
1849 and 1850. From Sydney and Hobart Town and
Melbourne every available vessel w T as put on the
run to San Francisco and sailed crammed with gold-
seekers. There is a curious reflection of this
new-born Trans-Pacific trade in the scanty annals
of the remote Pitcairn Island. Sixty years had
passed since the Bounty mutineers had settled there,
and in that time the island had scarcely been
visited except by whalers. Now it became a place
of call for scores of vessels sailing between
Australia and California. Island traditions tell
how one of the Christians saved the life of
the son of a successful digger returning to
Australia who had fallen overboard and how
the father offered him a bag of nuggets. The
simple Pitcairner handed the gold back —he had
no use for it. To these ships, hastily equipped and
sailing amongst islands and reefs but imperfectly
charted, the Pacific offered many dangers. Wil-
liam O’Hanlon Was one of a ship’s com-
pany' cast away on a desert island and
shared in a voyage of hundreds of miles
in an open boat. From the shipowners’ point
of view the danger was not ended when the vessel
reached port. For at ’Frisco then, as in Port
Phillip a few years later, crews were apt to leave
their vessels lying in harbor while they went dig-
ging, and new crews could hardly be had for love
or money. Amongst the thousands of Australians
who rushed to California were not only men like
Hargreaves, but the scum of the old convict popula-
tion. They soon distinguished themselves, under the
title of “Sydney Ducks” or “Sydney Coves,” as the
toughest of the many tough elements in California,
outdoing the “Greasers,” the “Hounds” and the
“Hoosiers.” Sydney Cove, the part of ’Frisco which
they most affected, became known as the liveliest
part of that very lurid town, and the storm-centre
of the most spirited gambling, robbery and shoot-
ing in the place. These birds were, of course, only
Australians by adoption, and against their will, but
Australia was given full credit for them. It is
recorded that John Jenkins, who had the honor, in
1851, of being the first man hanged by order of the
famous Vigilance Committee, was a “Sydney Duck.”
There were two star actors at the next hanging, on
August 24, 1851, and one of them, Samuel AVhit-
taker, also gave Sydney as his last address. lie
was a “knightly scoundrel,” according to Bancroft
the American historian, a prototype apparently of
another Australian, Frank Gardiner, the “King of
the Road,” who went to ’Frisco some years later
and ended his days there. Apart from its hanging
bees the Vigilance Committee was inconsiderate
enough to shove a number of these picturesque if
ruffianly adventurers on board vessels outward bound
for Australia. Others stayed, and probably became
politicians.
Tiie Bulletin’s “Oldest Inhabitant,” J.
M. Forde, will be 80 next month : he is
spending his twilight at Springwood, in the
Blue Mountains. The Fordes and the
Duffys (of the High Court) are kinsmen.
Charles Gavan Duffy’s father, the grand-
father of the Judge, was in business in
Monaghan; and the “Oldest Inhabitant’s”
grandmother was a Duffy of a farming family
close by.
Of the 143 members who sat in the Vic-
torian Parliament after the general election
held on March 28, 1889 —the date on which
the Reform Act, increasing the number of
legislators, became operative—only three are
now' serving, and one of the trinity has
changed from one Chamber to the other.
Alex. Peacock, who is in training for a third
term as Premier, has held his (Clunes-Allen-
dale) seat for the 31 years continuously.
A. R. Outtrim (Maryborough), now a bant-
ling of 75, who first got in 35 years ago,
had one break of 18
months while the
Kyabramapootra was
cock o’ the walk.
Agar Wynne was in
the House of Pluish
with Zeal. Sargood,
Service, Nick Fitz-
gerald, Simon Fraser,
Balfour and J. M.
Davies in 1889. but he
wandered out 10 years
ago to browse in Com-
monwealth pastures
and lean against a
post-office when tired.
After restoring the
King’s head to post-
age-stamps and shoo-
ing away the kan-
garoo, Agar Wynne
found his way into
the Assembly paddock
in 1917. He strayed
on to Cabinet clover
for three months, and
was then chased out
with Bowser; but
Bowser got back
through another gate.

when Henry Copeland woke up, blearily

Oates again, Mr. Speaker,” retorted Haynes,
pointing the finger of scorn at Copeland
“But, thank God, not as tight as Copeland!’’
A Queensland Labor member struck an
enlightened representative of the Down-and-
out fraternity the other day. The Labor
M.P. had been “bitten,” and the bloke's
mate, of course, backed in his barrel’. “Are
you Mr. Vacantstare?” said the object of
misery. “No, I am not.” was the reply
(the Labor man was getting tired) : “I’m Mr.
Vowles, the leader of the Opposition."
“Vowles?” answered the graduate of the
University of Adversity. “Ah, that’s good
—so you collect lOU’s. Take mine for a
dollar, will you?”
WHAT THE FOOLS DID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I promised Jones, he promised me,
And Johnson promised him ;
And Mrs. Johnson came to tea
With Mrs. Smith and said that three
More voters with defiance grim
Would never poll for Lee.
I nursed nine babies on my knee
And kissed their mouths with care.
Each mother smiled with pride to see
How soon her infant took to me
And clawed my jaws and hair.
She would not vote for Lee.
I stood at dusk beside a tree;
And from a soap-box stout
I told the folk that two and three
Made five, as all men must agree.
They cheered. I knew without a doubt
They would not vote for Lee.
In other ways I made my plea
From balconies and trains ;
And everywhere there came to me
A sense of certain victory.
No man, I said, with any brains
Could ever vote for Lee!
My rival smiled for all to see
Through this unequal test.
He said his party’s policy
Was good enough for such as lie;
And there he let it rest.
Now who could vote for Lee?
All seemed as right as it could be ;
The people loved me well.
We marked the roll from K to V,
From A to Z and back to P ;
And Johnson muttered, “Who the hell
Is left to vote for Lee?”
The great day came. The voters free
Must now decide his fate.
The people voted hard for me;
There was a great majority.
Not mine, I grieve to state —
The fools supported Lee.

THE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT
OF
THE AUSTRALIAN IRON & STEEL INDUSTRY
//

muSITRV
Work for Australians
AND
Security for Australia
If all the Iron and Steel Products now imported were
made by our own people , work at Australian rates of
wages would be given to not less than
30,000 Men
who would receive in wages more than
£5,000,000 Per Year
These 30,000 workers in turn would give support to over
120,000 Others
By these means large numbers of skilled mechanics would
. be available as munition workers in time of need.
Every Australian should realise that
The Australian Iron and Steel Industry
is a NATURAL Industry, a KEY Industry, a BASIC Industry.
120,000 others would be supported
in one way or another by these 30,000 workers in the Australian Iron and Steel Industry.
30,000 Men would receive more than £5,000,000 Per Ye3T
if all the Iron and Steel Products required in Australia were made in the Commonwealth.
THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
states in its majority report—
“lt is impossible to in any way investigate the Iron and Steel Industry without coming to the conclusion that its establishment on a sound basis
should, above all other industries under review, receive the careful consideration of Parliament. In this industry only men are employed, and
there are few other industries which will so materially help in giving healthful and intelligent employment to a large population. It creates a
continuous demand for skilled labor—from the chemist and metallurgist to the artisan. Its products are among the fundamental necessities of all
trades, and, in view of the distance at which the Commonwealth is placed from outside sources of supply, the establishment of the industry should
be looked upon as a National necessity, even at the cost of what may to some extent be a considerable initial sacrifice. Not only is its foundation
an essential requirement from the standpoint of the needs of defence, but also for the everyday requirements of widespread dependent industries....
the establishment of the main industry with some vigor and vitality should be the aim of the Nation.”

“Business As Usual.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SERGEANT LEWIS GUNN (herein-
after called the Old Soldier) stood
looking at his reflection in the shop-
window. His breast had a row of ribbons
for long service and good conduct. He
noticed that one of them was frayed and
shabby; so having a slack afternoon he
decided to renew it from the Ordnance
Stores, where ribbons can be had for seven-
pence per yard.
The Old Soldier walked to the barracks
and presented himself at the counter where
the clothing is issued. He stated his require-
ments.
“You will get nothing here without a
requisition signed by the Ordnance Officer,”
they told him, and lie was directed to another
building where the clerical work of the
Ordnance Department was done.
A youth at the desk requested the Old
Soldier's business. On being informed, he
tilled up Requisition Form F2O (in dupli-
cate), and the Old Soldier put down the
sevenpence.
The youth was very much perturbed.
“Oh, you must get someone to identify you.'’
he said, “and he’ll have to certify that you
are entitled to wear the ribbon.”
The Old Soldier agreed that this was
absolutely necessary. He had only been
attending the barracks for 25 years and
was a comparative stranger.
The youth handed him the requisition (in
duplicate), and lie went to a third building
where an officer was supposed to be who
would supply the necessary certificate. The
officer was out, but returned in 15 minutes.
After supplying the certificate lie drew
attention to the fact that the Ordnance
Officer or his deputy had not signed the
requisition.
The Old Soldier returned to the clerk
wlo nad given him the requisition, and, put-
ting down the sevenpence again, asked the
clerk to get the signature.
The youth informed the Old Soldier that
the requisition could not be signed until the
sevenpence was paid.
With some warmth the Old Soldier told
the youth that the money was under his nose.
The youth’s nose went a little higher. "We
don’t take money here,” he said. “You
must pay that to the District Paymaster
at the pay office in the next building, and
when you bring the receipt here I will get
the requisition signed.”
The Old Soldier gathered up his papers
and pence and betook himself to the pay
office in another building, where, after some
time, a worried clerk arose from behind en-
trenchments of accounts and directed him to
the Receiving Officer. The Receiving Officer,
after listening affably to his story, took
down from a shelf a long official receipt-
book and filled in a receipt and the butt
thereof for the sum of sevenpence.
When the Old Soldier returned for the
third time to the Ordnance office the original
clerk was out, so a new clerk took the
requisition (in duplicate) and the Pay-
master’s receipt and disappeared into the
holy of holies. He returned with the infor-
mation that the matter would now go before
the Signing Officer.
When “the matter” had gone before the
Signing Officer the Old Soldier heaved a sigh
of relief: it seemed to him he was now close
up to his objective. He asked the clerk what
was the next step to take. The clerk, after
looking serious for a minute, said, “Urn, let
me see! I think you have to get Mr.
Whaffles’s stamp on the requisition.”
“Who is Mr. Whaffles?” asked the Old
Soldier.
"Mr. Whaffles is the supervisor of cloth-
ing.'’ said the clerk. “You will find him
upstairs in room number umpty-one, and
knock at the door when you get there.”
The Old Soldier followed instructions, and
in due course reached the door of Mr.
Whaffles’s office and knocked.
“Come in!” said a voice, and the Old
Soldier walked in and presented the requisi-
tion (in duplicate) and the Paymaster’s receipt.
The Supervisor selected a. rubber-stamp
from an enormous heap and gravely opened
up an inkpad. Having adjusted his sights
and restrained his breathing, he took aim
and scored an outer —low, left—on the
requisition, and a magpie on the duplicate.
He inspected the result with deliberation,
and then decided that it was a strenuous
old world. After which he kept one copy,
and. handing the other back to the Old
Soldier, genially informed him that all he
had to do was to present the requisition to the
storekeeper and everything would be right.
The Old Soldier felt that his pilgrimage
was nearly _ over. With a jaunty step he
once more invaded the store. The officer-
in-charge having inspected the requisition
disappeared behind some bales of clothing,
and then returned to report that the matter
was now in the hands of the storeman.
The storeman was a person of no conse-
quence whatever. He didn’t have so much
as a stick of sealing-wax about him. He
merely pushed his head around a corner and
said: “There’s none of that ribbon in stock!
We haven’t had none for months!”
Then the devil of mischief entered into
the Old Soldier. “Well,” he said, “I want
my sevenpence back.”
The office swooned. The operation would
take weeks! Then one of the officials got a
brain wave. “Look,” he said, “you are wear-
ing other ribbons. For God’s sake take some
of those!”
The office was on the verge of collapse.
The Old Soldier’s heart softened, and he
accented the way of escape shown to him.
So his rank and name were entered in a
ledger, and he signed and received the rib-
bons lie didn’t want and had no use for.
On his return through the city the Old
Soldier called at Blank and Co.’s military
stores. He asked for and got the ribbon he
required, and one man did it all in exactly
2 3 minutes. But it was sold to him at the
I’ate of nine shillings per yard.
The Old Soldier has a youthful son who
aspires to enter a Military College later on.
As the boy is rather weak in arithmetic
the Old Soldier is. coaching him up for the
entrance examination. The following prob-
lems have got him thinking:—
(a) If it takes 10 men three hours to supply a
piece of ribbon to a soldier, how long will it take
to fit out an Army Corps?
(b) If a piece of ribbon valued at 7d._ costs
Isay) 30s. to deliver, what will it cost to supply
a battleship?

A co. which discloses good profits nowadays
is. liable to .be accused of profiteering; so
I* inney Isles’s chairman hastens to explain :
The co. never handled so large a volume of
business as that which has been transacted during
the period under review. The extra' profit is
accordant with the increase in turnover, 'and not a
penny of it has been got by bumping ifp prices—
it lias been gained without any attempt at profiteer-
ing. We have steadily adhered to our traditional
policy of moderate profits and of giving good value
lor money. Every available penny of the eo.’s
capital, its reserves and debentures, and, at one
stage, a considerable sum advanced by our bankers,
were put into the judicious buying of stocks, and
the Jesuit is that throughout the year our customers
have been able to buy from us at prices far less
than they could have bought those same goods at
(he same time from the wholesalers in British and
other oveiseas markets.
Managing-director Conkes might have added
that the large turnover of higher-priced
good.s followed naturally on abnormal local
conditions. Instead of driving them to
economise to help pay the huge war bill,
the Commonwealth Government’s plan of
paying it almost entirely out of loans has
made the people of the Northern State,’ as
of other parts of the continent, feel even
better off than they used to be. In addi-
tion. Queensland has had a Labor Govern-
ment which has been buying popularity by
spending over 12A millions of loan-money
during. the past five years. So it is not
surprising to find a rapid growth of gross
profits in a retail concern which in normal
times had been bounding ahead :
! 1917, • £111 .364 | 1919. . £155,027
1915.. 111,999 | 1918. . 134,312 j 1920. . 165,663
Though the pre-war net profits average has
been now practically doubled, shareholders
have not benefited to that extent, for the
expansion of the business and the higher
cost of stocks have demanded the einploy-
?ent of further funds, and since 3914
has been got in from shareholders.
Besides that extra new money put into the
business £41,916 of reserves have also been
accumulated as a result of the directors' con-
servative policy of keeping the div. rate
at 8 p.c. Still, on account of the capitalisa-
tion of some of the reserves, the return to
shareholders has been somewhat better than
8 p.c. during recent years.
The additional funds from new share issues
and from accumulated profits have been put
to work in this way:—

The “other assets” item shown in the first
column represented the Mnrwillumbah and
Maryborough interests. Formerly there was
a considerable goodwill on the* books—in
1005 £16,235 of a paid capital of £29,462
was represented by that item—but nowa-
days the balance-sheet is entirely free of all
intangible assets. During the past year
the co. distributed a 5 p.c. dividend in the
form of bonus shares, apparently calling for
£10,715; but as reserves were reduced by
only £0206, the difference is probably
accounted for by £l5OO having been charged
in premiums on the new issue of shares, or
by drawing on an contingency
account. Portion of the new capital has
been spent in buying property adjoining the
present Queen-street premises, thus provid-
ing for future extensions if the business
continues to expand. Notwithstanding the
new capital got in and the substantial re-
serves accumulated, the co. is still working
on a_ lot of outside money: there is £39,000
of 5 p.c. interminable debenture stock;
£53,960 is owing on properties; and at Jan-
uary 31 last £33,834 was due to sundry
creditors. However, there was a surplus
of liquid assets (including stocks) over lia-
bilities of £157,231, compared with a sur-
plus of £86,711 just prior to the war.

It js unusual to find a combination of heavy-
weights like John Grice, Bowes Kelly and
H m. Jamieson nursing a lame'dog like this
Speck West-Coast railway. The co. took
oyer the Emu Bay-Bischoff line in the days
of the Zeehan boom, paying £lOO,OOO for
rights and concessions,” and it hit out
(partly with borrowed money) on a new line
to the silver-field. But the boom burst, and
prospects of the enterprise ever being able to
do much more than pay its way became very
remote. During recent years it has not even
done that much: since 1913 operations have
resulted in a loss of over £28,000. and in
addition the management has had to find over
£20,000 for badly-needed renewals. Last
year 30-odd miles were condemned, and had
to be relaid, the traffic meantime being
slowed down to about the world's record
crawl. The co. has not been able to meet
even interest on debentures, etc., and this
slide in the liquid position has taken place
since 1913:
1913. 1918. 1919.

Liabilities (apart from

Excess liabilities . . £5,876 £37,950 £36,857
With £19,112 ear-marked for the relaying
of the Burnie-Guildford section, the excess
of liabilities over more or less liquid assets
will be approximately £56,000 when the
bills are settled. It’s a cheerless record, and
apparently prospects hinge chiefly on how
the Read-Rosebery group of mines be-
haves. If their complex ores are mastered
—the metal contents are there all right—
this railway co. may yet breathe a little
more freely again. Meantime, the co. is
having a very cold time, and its customers
are also suffering in silence. There are
several curious anomalies in its traffic
arrangements. For instance, Zeehan gets
a daily train and an occasional goods ; but
the Waratah section, which is apparently the
more profitable portion, sees only two very
mixed trains each week. When the freight
lists were last sighted, the co. was carrying
ore from Zeehan to Burnie at 12s. 6d. per
ton; from Farrell (20 miles less haulage),
325. fid.; and from Waratah (half-way) 60s.
The competition of the State-owned Zeehan-
Strahan line, no doubt, explains why the
Zeehan section is given preferential service
and rates. Still, the co. deserved better
luck, for it had done much for the Speck in
opening up country.

Don’t mention it within hearing of the no-
liquor people, but that much improved profit
was chiefly due to bar-takings springing
£2917. The rest of the little seaside pub
also did £453 better than in the previous
year, and since exes, moved ahead by only
about £450. after providing twice as' much
as at the 1919 balance for depreciation, etc.,
a 10 p.c. div. was possible. Whether it was
advisable to so lift the div. rate that it should
mop up practically all the profit is another
matter. Reserves are still trifling, and it is
doubtful whether there are vet tangible
assets to represent all the paid capital.
W hen the co. took over in 1912 it paid some-
thing for goodwill, but exactly now much
was not stated. Instead of rushing up the
div. rate the better plan would hare been
to have paid off debt and blown off
some of the goodwill froth: that would have
made the maintenance of a reasonable div
easier. Paid capital is £14,010. and sincp
properties, goodwill, furniture and plant
have run away with £21,798, to finance the
business the management is working on a
£6OOO mortgage and owes £1534 besides. On
the other side, after payment of the div
there were more or less liquid assets total-
ling £2130. the excess of liabilities over
liquid assets thus being £5404. At the close
of the co.’s first year liabilities exceeded
liquid assets by £6627; but practically half
of the improvement of £1223 is accounted
for by additional capita] got in.

Arctic silver show, Canada, to a new co.
for £SO,OOO. Years of development work and
fossicking have failed to remove the Kal-
goorlie mine from the list of failures at
depth. The property is soundly managed,
but it is apparently in a hopeless condition.
Once-golden Coolgardie is nowadays un-
earthing minerals and ores used in pottery
and other trades. One mine is supplying
mica to Perth manufacturers, and several
lots of felspar have been sent east. There
was some talk recently of raising capital to
work some tin deposits and to dig coal, but
so far no one seems to have been courageous
enough to put up the cash.
A writer in a recent Mining Magazine
tells a good story of how the flotation pro-
cess was first regarded by American mining
men. “The processes were practically
ignored. Many eminent TJ.S.A. authorities
looked askance at the British inventors, and
regarded them as charlatans on the level
of gold-brick merchants. An article on oil
flotation sent to New York Engineering
and Mining Journal in 1899 was returned
with the comment ‘Heavy minerals don’t
float: do not write articles for the E. and
M.J. after a champagne lunch,!’” By the
way, though a flotation process was pro-
bably first invented in Britain —by a Scotch-
man—the process now employed is almost
wholly an Australian development.

Gold mining at Reefton (M.L.), helped
no doubt by the gold premium, has taken
on a new lease of life. Development work
at the Big River, Ready Bullion, Keep-it-
dark and Boatman mines is being pushed
vigorously at present. Operations have also
been resumed at Murray Creek mine. The
Consolidated group are in active operation,
last year’s production being: Progress Mine,
16,320 tons, giving 28s. 6d. per ton recovery;
Blackwater, 31.728 tons, worth 38s. Gd.:
Wealth of Nations. £4955; total value of
output. £89,639. Blackwater ore reserves
are stated at 84.887 tons, averaging
10.84dwt. The ore deposition at the Pro-
gress is_ patchy, due to an excessive amount
of faulting, and this_ mine looks like getting
towards the end, owing to inability to trace
ore below the winze workings in the No. 11
level.

The Utility Motor does all kinds of Handy Jobs around the Farm.

POWER and LIGHT
brightens up the farm
T OTS of country homes will brighten up after
the Royal Sydney Show because of
I——* Western Electric Power and Light. Scores
of farmers have seen this plant—and many will
buy it because of its wonderful advantages.
Western Electric Power and Light brings to the country home
all the convenience and comfort of city electric light. It not only
abolishes the bother of kerosene lamps and air-gas outfits, but
it does so many valuable jobs around the farm that it pays for
itself over and over again.
Farmers want Western Electric Power and Light because the battery
is big and strong with a capacity of 180 Ampere Hours. This means that
there’s plenty of current available for operating fans, washing-machines,
sewing-machines, irons, toasters and electric-cookers, that bring joy to a
woman’s heart. You can have a Utility Motor for driving the churn,
separator or grindstone, and use the 3H-H.P. Engine for operating light
machines.
Farmers who use Western Electric Power and Light are continually
adapting it to new needs —there is no end to its uses. If you want to make
your farm truly bright—with electric light anywhere at the touch of a
J witch buy the big, strong Western Electric Outfit that pays for itself.
The whole plant is simplicity itself. The engine runs on kerosene, is a
self-starter, feeds itself with fuel and oil, and automatically stops when the
battery is fully charged. It is throttle-governed, air-cooled, and a higli-
orade piece of machinery with 50 years of electrical experience behind it
as a guarantee of reliability. Western Electric Power and Light is easy
to buy! Write for 20-page illustrated and descriptive booklet. It is
Post Free.

THE TOP NOTCH SCOTCH
A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGINAHTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“C.M.S.”: As the result of a fairly exten-
sive experience as a country sawbones I have come
to the conclusion that the bite of the red-backed
spider is never fatal, except possibly in the case
of very young, very aged or extremely debilitated
people. The symptoms are local pain and slight
swelling and more or less profound general “shock,”
mostly not of a very alarming nature. I came up
against a curious belief in the south-west of W.A.,
that, failing suitable treatment, death would follow
the bite of the red-back at midnight of the day
on which it occurred. As a result of this fallacy, I
was treated to a wild gallop against time over a
rough bush track on the pressing invitation of a
settler whose wife had been bitten late one evening.
I lost the race and, arriving shortly after midnight,
was greeted with the sad news that the victim had
died “just at 12 o’clock.” She hadn’t, but it
took some strenuous persuasion to induce her to
recover from the fainting fit that terror had caused
when the hour struck.
* * * *
“C.E.G.”: How many down South know
the value of the wild marjoram or sacred balm ? It
is extensively used as a flavoring for soups, tea,
etc., by prospectors and cattle-men in the North,
and I am surprised that some enterprising firm has
not put it on the market. Its strong aromatic flavor
and its value as a preventive of fevers would soon
bring in the profits.
STILL STICKING TO THEIR
COUNTRY.
DIRTY DANIEL: “Well, there’s one thing in
our favor, ’Orace. We ’ave never
’indered our country’s progress in ’er
’our of need.”
’ORACE: Ow ’aren’t we, Daniel?”
DIRTY DANIEL: “We 'aren’t gone out on
strike yet.”
“Timo”: As one with first-hand experi-
ence in feeding molasses to stock I can accord it
no virtues other than those of cheapness and being
an appetiser. When I added a little to the feed
of dairy cows I found the quantity of milk reduced
by over a third, and the butter-fat fell to about
3 p.c. I disagree, too, with those who claim that
molasses gives stamina to horses. A quart a day
with meals for six months will considerably reduce
the working capacity of a nag; especially is this
so on the Northern canefields. The sticky stuff
makes for sluggish liver, and any horse student
knows what that means. All the grooming one can
give will not prevent a molasses-fed prad becoming
hidebound. For endurance and capacity for quick
recovery I go bull-headed for the grain-fed moke
that doesn’t know the taste of molasses.
“M.H.S.”: The Mary Valley (Q.) forests
grow some very fine specimens of hoop-pine, but sel-
dom produce such a tree as was logged a few weeks
ago. The length was 153 ft. and the girth of the butt
log was 142 in. The quantity of millable timber
logged from the shrub was 9355 s. ft., of which
3588 was first-class and is worth 21s. per 100 s. ft.
on trucks Imbil. The remainder was knotty and
worth Bs. per 100 s. ft. on trucks. The total value
on trucks is £72 2s. 4d. Marketing costs amounted
to ss. 3d. per 100 s. ft. The Forest Service netted
£47 11s. 2d. for the tree, the logger and teamster
received £24 11s. 2d. for their work. The sawn
product will be worth at least £l5O. While much
of the first-class logs will be sawn into valuable
wide boards, which will not be put into buildings,
the quantity will be sufficient to build a five-roomed
dwelling.
“Barcoo”: In the early ’nineties two
brothers on Terrick Terrick (C.Q.), a station on the
Barcoo, then owned by Donald Wallace, of Carbine
fame, were paid for 12,000 kangaroo scalps in one
year. In those times a bonus of 6d. per head was
allowed by local Marsupial Boards. Rodgers, of
Aramac (C.Q.), undoubtedly the champion ’roo hunter
of the Commonwealth 10 or 12 years ago, would have
complained very much and shifted his hunting-
grounds if he accounted for less than 7500 each
year. Another great performance was put up by
two brothers who had just lobbed out from Ireland
to find themselves up against the big ’9l strike.
Somebody advised them to go ’roo shooting, and
they started in the Westbourne paddock on Saltern
Creek, Barcaldine (C.Q.). They kept at the game
for three years, and then went back to Erin with
£3OOO. I was their adviser, and saw them off
the premises with the wallet.
* * * *
“Jack L.”: The name of the beetle that
“11. Church” (B. 15/l/’2O) was asking about is
the praying insect, and is named so because of the
way it folds its front legs when patiently waiting
for a bee, a fly or other insect upon which it preys.
The young are hatched from an egg about the size
of a bantam’s, and which when first laid resembles
a lump of froth. About 50 little ones are born in
the papery case, and use the structure as a hiding-
place during the first few days of their hatching.
The mother selects a prickly bush as a maternity
hospital, thereby making it harder for mischievous
climbers to harm her progeny.
* * *
“Riverina”: In the endurance stakes you
can have ’em all if you leave me a boundary-rider
named Fisher that I knew on a station in the
Balranald (N.S.W.) district many years ago. His
horse fell with him and broke both his legs high
up. There being no hope of early help, with his
pocket-knife he cut and pointed two short sticks, and,
one in each hand, started to drag himself to the
coach track two miles away. He reached it, after
wearing out many sticks. Curious bushmen verified
his yarn by tracking him back to the spot where
his nag crashed.
* * * »
“Forester”: The name of Cuninghame
(mostly mis-spelt Cunningham or Cunninghame),
which the township of
Lakes Entrance (Vic.)
suffered under until a-
year or two ago. was a
monument to the snob-
bery of some local
Bumbles. Lakes Entrance
was the old and proper
name of the place, but
years ago, when a Cun-
inghame—s ome h o w re-
lated to the Duke of
Argyle—honored Gipps-
land by settling near Sale,
the place was re-named
after him. He went and
left but a memory, and
now the name has faded
off the map. Neighboring
Bairnsdale owes its name
to old William McLeod,
who brought some fami-
lies there from Monaro
when it was one of his
cattle-stations about the
year one. They reared so many children that when
he saw and heard them he called it, in good Scots,
Bairns’ Dale.
* * » *
“C. Coral”: A handy device which the
Torres Strait islander used to keep in his armory
in the old days, alongside his convex-headed stone
club and his shark’s-teeth “sword,” was a weapon
somewhat resembling a tennis-racquet. The frame
was made generally of tough bush cane, spliced on
to a handle of hard wood. This handle extended
some inches within the frame, and was sharpened
to a fine point. The mode of using the implement
was simple. The operator deftly slipped the frame
over his victim’s head from behind, gave a pull and
a forward push—woosh ! —and an effective spiking
was the result.
* * * *
“Buzz”: The record cod, landed from the
Big Trickle at Echuca (Vic.) not long back, tapped
the scales at 14cwt. Last month another midget of
1061 b. supplied the town with cod cutlets. As far
as I know a 90-pounder caught at Rochester (Vic.)
some 10 years ago is the biggest Murray cod cap-
tured away from the parent stream. Though the
Campaspe at Rochester teems with great cod, they
are seldom camrht, and are only seen when, stupefied
by a freshet, they float on top of the water.
“Umbrona”: In the interests of a possible
race of life-saving dogs for Australian surf resorts,
how about gathering accounts of what dogs can do
on the ocean beaches? Here is one for a start.
There is a black cattle-dog, Toby by name, resident
HERO WORSHIP.
“ That’s the first time I ever seen Bill with
more beer than he can carry.”
at Coolum Beach, some 60 miles north of Brisbane,
strong in build and as active and intelligent as
a dog can be. As a puppy he went bathing with
the children, and learnt from his now-deceased pre-
decessor in the family’s affections how to battle
with the seas. A stick two or three feet long
thrown far out is sufficient excuse for him to
enter the furthest breakers, and swim inwards and
outwards and round about till he tires or comes
ashore with the prize. No matter in which direction
he is heading at the time, when a breaker comes
(size makes no difference and he seems to know by
instinct when it is upon him) he makes a vigorous
upward spring, and it is rarely that his black scalp
does not show above the froth. Any dog-trainer
could soon substitute a dummy drowning-man for
the stick, or get a line taken out instead of a
stick brought in.
* » * »
“W.L.”: The tourist char-il-banc was
toiling up a long, sandy hill from Rotorua towards
Waimangu (M.L.), when the driver turned from his
horses and said that if any of the gentlemen were
interested in science they would see some iron
springs if they walked up the hill. About 12 men,
including a stout gent, from Footscray, jumped
down and walked. All the iron springs they saw
were on the ’bus; but the stout gent, from Footscray
had a busy time poking about the volcanic soil,
lie was very hot about it.
* * * *
Harry K. Eustace on the “brontosaurus”:
The public is expecting great things to be dis-
covered in the legend-haunted swamps of Africa,
such as gigantic animals and “ reptiles of hitherto
unknown species. How seriously is taken the latest
African romance of the “bro. tosaurus” 1 I long
ago investigated this matter and found that the
creature lives only in the imaginations of men who
talk a lot but do very little. They show nothing,
not even a Kodak picture of the spoor. The bronto-
saurus fallacy can be reasonably accounted for, how-
ever. When a man tired out with the heat and hard-
ships of a game trail in the half-dried swamps of
the centre of Africa, is suddenly faced by the up-
rearing of a huge and terrific form in the gloom of
the swamp, do we hear of immediate investigation
taking place? No! Merely his impressions are
blazoned forth, and the world thrills with anticipa-
tion for more, and there for a while the matter
rests. What the man saw was an elephant on its
last legs. The Grand Old Man or Mother of the
powerful herd of elephants is driven to seek shelter
from the hardships of travel, and therefore spends
the remainder of its days in the graveyard of its
forebears, the wide expanse of mostly gloomy swamps,
there wandering around, blind, feeble, searching in
its misery the coolest places, its body plastered, as
a protection from the heat rays of the sun, with
thick mud. The mud, cracked, looks like the great
scales of armor-plate. The animal waves its trunk
from time to time, thrashing with a branch or tuft
of reeds, and oft-times in its misery of heart
trumpeting a fearsome blast, which shrills one
through and through. Nothing short of the “bronto-
saurus” is weird enough to explain the excited
traveller’s thrilling description of what was really
a muddy elephant ending its days miserably.
“Cadaver”: In the inquiry after long-
rooted vegetables, I produce the Westralian Christ-
mas-tree (Nuytsia floribunda), whose underground
orgtans, even in the parched sand-plains, run out for
over 100 yards. The average depth is about 2ft.
Special interest is attached
to this plant because it
is the largest mistletoe
in the world, and because
it sends out parasitic
roots which draw on the
surrounding trees and
shrubs for food materials.
In this way it has a de-
cided advantage over the
smaller branch-infesting
mistletoes, which are de-
pendent on one host-plant
only, and perish when the
particular branch they are
on dies. The food material
obtained by the Christ-
mas-tree enables it to
flower in the middle of the
Westralian summer, when
most other plants are at
their lowest ebb. The
brilliant orange blossoms
make a blaze of color un-
equalled by any other
plant on earth. Though
infested by thousands of
insects devouring the
honey which is secreted in
great quantities by the
flowers, never a beetle has
been observed by ento-
mologists amongst the
•number. Until recently
all attempts at raising the
Christmas-tree from seed
have been unsuccessful,
but last year Herbert, the
Government Botanist, suc-
ceeded in raising a few
hv allowing their roots to
come into contact with
other roots, such as those
of c ou c h-grass. The
amount of food material
parasitic ally removed from
these was sufficient to keep
the seedlings going till
they could fasten on to larger shrubs.
* * * *
“Fragrant”: “Biologist” (B. 25/3/’2O)
asks for scientific Australian observations as to
nutriment affecting sex of offspring of the higher
vertebrates. A learned obstetrician and gynaecolo-
gist who, when lecturing to students, wears returned
soldiers’ uniform (though the Lord only knows what
the Diggers wanted with a gyno. expert) has made
some interesting experiments on this subject. Being
a breeder of pheasants, he noticed that the greater
the cock-bird’s ardor the bigger the percentage of
hens among the chickens. He used this fact to
breed a large number of hens, which are the more
valuable, by mating a new cock-bird with the hen
as the former hubby’s ardor fieri. Going to the
top of the vertebrate tree a tale of an experiment by
another eminent gyno. expert is whispered. There
is a theory, backed up by observation, that if the
male of a species is under-nourished, male children
result. This gyno. expert, eager to test this, starved
himself, and his wife produced beautiful twins, both
fine children, but, sad to relate, both girls.
AFTER BABY WEEK.
PAPA: “There! Now can you see the baby-
elephant?”
LITTLE WILLIAM : “It’s enormous! I won-
der how many stories it took to bring
it?”
“Ibis” : Can anyone tell me the name and
purpose of the bee-like scamp that is eating circular
holes the size of threepenny-pieces in the foliage of
my lilac bushes ? He is similar in size and shape
to a bee, but his body is banded black and white. He
settles on a leaf, gets his jaws to work, running
them neatly round in a circle as true as a compass
could make, and then slopes off with the vegetable
traybit.

AUDITOR-QENERAL’S report.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 20 of the Commonwealth Bank Act. 191MM4. I
have to report that the Aggregate Balance Sheet of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the

“D.P.L.”: Caine across a snake making
for under the house. As there was no stick handy
1 picked him up by the tail; threw him clear and
rushed for a waddy. In a jiffy' 1 saw that he was
going to beat me, so I leaped back, caught him
again by the tail and slung him further; but again
lie looked like a winner. When I dashed at him once
more, d —d if he wasn’t going down the opening
tail first, winking an eye at me, as much as to
say: “Try it again, old cock!”
“Hawk”: Bolsheviks and 1.W.W.-ers
might study the hive bee ; here their ideas find full
expression, for the individual is entirely subordinate
to the community. A bee living an easy time may
exist two years; but when there is a good honey
flow they work themselves to death in a few days.
Providing for the young is more important than
providing for themselves. One female does all the
mothering, another set all the nursing; the males
are scrapped directly they are useless. The soviet
of the hive lives, thinks, slaves only for the
future. Love, mercy, consideration for others are
unknown, for I hose are all traits of individualism.
The bee thinks and acts only collectively; the sick
and maimed, not being useful assets, are cast out
of the hive to perish. Even death for herself is
unheeded by the worker if it helps the community.
Here there is no self-determination, no self at all.
only a personality common to each hive, a fraternity
in excelsis. There is a lot of cold logic in life
on six legs, but little sense of humor.

“Ashton Murphy”: In n moment of aber-
ration I bought an alarm-clock at Brodie’s store
when I was in for the week’s tucker. “Handy,”
said Brodie, “if you want to catch a train.” A
week or so later I had a hurried visit from a neigh-
bor, Ted Lincoln, who wanted to get the train
to Miles for the cattle sale. That night we set
the clock to the hour we wanted to be wakened.
Then we put it on a kerosene-tin and went to bed.
The old kangaroo-dog slept in the doorway and
kept an eye on the fowlyard for dingoes or foxes.
We had 60 fowls, a tame dingo-pup, a cat and a
cockatoo. All was peace when I went to sleep.
llat-tat-tat-tat! B-r-rrirrrrrr ! B-r-r-r! I leaped
in my sleep and fell over Ted, who was wildlv
groping for the clock. Br-br-br-r—r ! After a
tumult we got a pillow over the infernal clatter.
When I rose, dazed, the kangaroo-dog’ was streak-
WORTH MEETING.
THE J.P.: “Well, Bill, I’ll have to fine yon
five bob; how did you come to get so
drunk?"
THE CULPRIT : “A strange gentleman filled
me up, Boh —it didn't cost me a bean."
THE J.P. ( whispering ): “Must he an all-
right bloke, Bill. Is lie still here?"
mg for his life for the open country, followed by
the dingo-pun, tail between its legs, yelping like
old Henry. The cat was backing'-up the chimney,
back-arched, spitting a treat. The cockatoo was
hanging by its hind legs screeching at the top of
its voice, and the fowls were cackling- and squarking
-all they knew. In the midst of all this the old
horse bolted through the paling fence into the
scrub, followed by Ted, clad in his shirt. Bj- the
time Ted had caught him and pulled the splinters
out of his chest and I’d pulled the prickles out of
Ted the train had gone. Then I heaved the alarm-
clock into the scrub, where it struck thirty-two
without hesitation. P.S.—The train leaves twice a
week.
"B.B.” : Has mullet been mentioned? Then
let me introduce one of the family. It was sold
at the fish markets, Sydney, a few days ago, and
this is what the statistician reported: weight, 141 b.;
length, 2ft. 7iu. ; girth, 21in. Its home address
was the Manning River (N.S.W.).
A BIT OVER THE ODDS.
“Say, waiter, I really must complain about this rabbit. When I was pouring the milk
into my tea the bally thing started to purr!"
“Corboyne”: This native game was played
at Alligator Point on the Daly River (N.T.) not
far front a swamp. At night the frogs carried
on a concerted croaking which would last for a
few minutes and then suddenly stop. A tribe of
abos. camped in the vicinity used to amuse them-
selves by clapping their hands in unison with the
frogs. Any man, woman or piccaninny who failed
to stop immediately the
fiogs stopped became an
object of derision, accom-
panied by much hilarity,
until the chorus from the
swamp commenced again.
This didn’t do the frogs
much harm, but ic pre-
vented me from getting to
sleep, and no remonstrance
had any effect; so I con-
triced a tin disc on a
double string which, when
worked to and fro by the
bands, set up a rotary
motion accompanied by a
whirring noise. When night
came X tricked myself out
with luminous fungus and,
armed with the buzzer,
crept into the scrub where
the harmony was in full
swing. The debil-debil
music caused by the edge
of the disc grating- on a dead leaf did the trick.
Next day I passed the tribe about 10 miles down
stream, and they were going for their lives.
Biologist : The common aphis is not only
ihe milch cow of the ant, as mentioned by “Te
H hare” ; it is notable as being- a virgin mother,
and often has 20 generations of daughters, also
virgin mothers, in one season. If food is scarce' a
few males are born to pair with the females who
lay eggs to produce the virgin mothers of the next
season. The queen bee may also be a virgin
mother, but only of males; after the nuptial flight
she has the unique power of laying male or female,
eggs, as the hive desires. At his wedding the male
insect usually dies, or is killed and eaten by the
bride. Did this originate the surviving bashfulness
of the average bridegroom at th e wedding-breakfast?

“Yarraman”: Tell “Bongo” (B. 25/3/20)
to keep calm. Chris Larsen got the 417 post-holes
which lie put down in a day by buying- up dry
sub-artesian well bores and sawing them into required
lengths.
“Saxby”: The illicit business of “poddy-
dodging" in a fascinating pastime, popular in
Queensland. I know of four men who, in 1918,
secured £2600 worth of beasts in three months at
the game. If you are a smart cattle man all you
need is a pack-horse outfit, food and a brand. Often,
on account of a drought or strike, station managers
cannot brand all their calves, and when the news
gets round that there is a mob of unmarked animals
on a run a raiding gang is soon on the job mustering
the clean skins and driving them to where they can
be branded. Poddy-dodging is regarded as a legiti-
mate trade about Cloncurry. The police sometimes,
it is true, grow officious, but convictions by a jury
have been unheard of lately, so the police have
abandoned jury cases and prosecute before magis-
trates on the minor charge of illegally branding.
The heavy fines inflicted have aroused local indigna-
tion. They are not in accordance with the.spirit of
the times.

‘Pink” ; \\ lien I saw a tremendous commo-
tion advancing down the river, surmounted by a mass
of waving, snake-like things with pointed heads and
big, black, staring eyes, I theught I had ’em again,
lhe scare turned out to be a flock of ostriches from
a farm close by enjoying a swim. The big birds
seemed quite at home in the water, and, though not
as graceful as the swan, could give them points for
speed.
“Jobber”:; I found Strawberry one mid-
day newly-calved, in Blackguard Gully, Northern
Rivers. She had the offspring planted and, though
I searched carefully, I couldn’t locate the youngster.
Searched next day, with the same result. On the
third trip 1 decided to take ma home, which I did
with a lot of trouble. A fortnight later I came
across the missing baby, still alive, but very weak.
I put it on the saddle and took it home, but its
mother had other interests and would have no truck
with daughter. I put the latter on the bucket and
reared her. In the gully where she had spent a
fortnight there was plenty of running water, but has
anyone ever heard of a calf so young' drinking water - ?
Rie Toe” : Iu the hall of the country pub
the traveller discovered a man in a dirty shirt
who was seriously considering the frantic endea-
vors of two flies to leave a stick-paper. Could he
(the traveller) have a room? Yes, room 11. On
examination room 11 was found to be not guiltv
of water. Seizing the bell-pull, the stranger tugged
lustily. After waiting five minutes he tugged again
and then again. Soon he was using the cord with
all the energy of a Saudow enthusiast. He was
on the verge of apoplexy when the whiskers of the
man in the dirty shirt appeared around the edge
of the door. “Did you ring the bell?” asked a
voice through the whiskers. “Of course I did,”
snarled the visitor. “Well, chuck it,” said what
was inside the dirty shirt as be closed the door,
“or you’ll wake the missus.”
“Aillsbells”: The only failiug of old
Sandy, the cook at the survey camp, was his over-
fondness for rum. The boss, however, was strictly
teetotal. Wouldn’t allow any grog near the camp,
and would sack any man bringing it to the cook.
Whenever possible he went himself to town for stores.
All the same, I knew that Sandy - was satisfied.
Never wi out it, laddie,” he said, when I questioned
him; “never - wi’out it; presairves the stomach. How
do i get it out here? W ell, the boss brings it tae
me wi’ the stoles. Yes, -the boss himsel’. Ye see, I
hue a bit arrangement wi’ the butcher in each too.i,
and gener'ly manage tae get a bottle, maybe twa’
each time the boss goes tae toon. Ye ken, the sheep
cooms in a chaff-bag. Wull, the rum coonis in the

“•Jim Carew”: Will Lawtoff, who rode 47
brumbies in one day, according to “Mulga” (B.
25/3/’2O), must have struck a particularly pooi-
conditioned and mean-spirited lot. I have been
among horses all my life, and have had a lot to do
with brumbies, and I declare that “Mulga’s” state-
ment is preposterous. Any brumby, when first
saddled, will give a horseman a very lively quarter
of an hour. Allowing that, Lawton must have been
riding roughies for 11$ hours, a physical impos-
sibility. Then there would also be the time spent
it: roping the horses and getting the bridle and
saddle on. “Mulg-a” asks if the performance has
been beaten. It hasn’t, and never will be.

diprotodon was not “a beast, of the dugong species,"
but a marsupial resembling a wombat in general

nivorous monster as large as a polar bear.

“Bung”: The white crab inquired about
by “Onlooker” (B. 25/3/’2O) is the sand-nipper,
common along the. N. S. Wales coast. His on,
enormous claw (in mature specimens it is longer
than all the rest of his body) is only displayed as
a warning to foes, whilst he feeds with its coin-
paratively-diminutive fellow. Otherwise the big
ftst is of no use to him. For such a weakling the
weapon is far too unwieldy in fight. He depends
for safety on his marvellous ability to get out of
sight and remain there. He burrows into the sand
with incredible speed, and a gang of Government
sand-shifters would not locate him before knoek-ofl
time.

“C. Coral” : If you are cast away on an
island that has nothing better than a few fruiting
coeoanut palms, you’re not as unfortunate as you
might think. The trees will furnish meat, drink,
rope, palm-leaf shirt, drinking vessels and about
a score of other necessaries. The husk of the dry
nul, set to smoulder, sends out an aroma that,
suddenly reminds skeeters they have an important
engagement elsewhere. Anybody who can spare
the time to make a fortune has only to tow a
cocoanut-ringed island up the Hawkesbury River.

“Weasel”: There’s a prohibition against
taking birds-of-paradise from Papua, but a few arc
smuggled out, all the same. A whilo ago a Customs
officer at Port Moresby noticed that a very swanky
passenger was sprouting a feather through his waist-
coat. He found that the suspect had a couple of
the birds stowed away in his bosom. And re
wouldn’t accept the traveller’s explanation that they
w ere worn by the doctor’s orders as chest protectors.
BEEF AND BIFF.
BILLY (an ex-pro.) : “Ah, many’s the time
Fee lasted ten rounds in the good old
days.”
MILLY: “Yes, ice had some lovely beef for
the counter-lunch then, didn’t ice?”
“.Magpie”: The Too, desperate when you
have him cornered, will rip a tormenting dog to
ribbons. Experienced hunters, to save the dogs,
get two stout sticks, about 3ft. long, present one to
the kanga with the left hand, and, when he seizes
it with both paws, the other waddy is slogged on to
his nut. He is then ready for the skinning-knife.
WHAT’S IN A NAME?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What's in a name? When Eden blushed with roses
And Eve blushed even fairer than the rest,
Adam, disturbed with thoughts between his doses,
His names upon the whole creation prest.
He christened elephant and duck and kitten
And found amusement in the simple job;
But would it matter to the person bitten
If he had called the snake a slitherwob ?
Would it have mattered to the lean hyena
If he had called the thing a blighted curse,
Or if the roaring tiger had just been a
Damned nuisance—or some term a little worse?
Cow, dog, horse, pig—-mix up the names and welcome,
Say crows are swans and scorpions are kites,
You still, in fruiting time, might find all Hell come
When flving-foxes scent the autumn nights.

A Plain
Fact!
The Age of Minor Poets
Within the charmed circle of the Poetry
Bookshop, under the leadership of Harold
Monro and Edward Marsh, are some
20 or 30 of the most vigorous and
insurgent of English minor poets. The
Bookshop is seething with energy and
youth: it publishes anthologies, it bour-
geons with monthly chapbooks and
holds weekly readings. Its adherents, vol-
uble and vehement, have sought to take
Parnassus by storm. “Every aspect of life
shall be the subject of our art, and what
we see we will describe in the language
which we use every day. The result shall
be the New Poetry, the vital expression of
a new race”—such is the manifesto of
minor poets on the verge of anarchy.
Almost parallel is the poetic effervescence in
France at the present day. Andre Spire,
Paul Fort, Henri Gheon, Rene Arcos, Jean
de Bosschfere —new names now; and how
many will be remembered at the end of the
century or even half-way through it, except
that Bosschbre’s perverted realism success-
fhlly scandalised a whole troupe of British
censors ? An age is largely incapable of
judging its own greatness: the strong con-
test of opinion is too close to the events
themselves. Yet amid the l'ecent foamings
and expectorating of war poets and the
clamorous babble of post-war tongues—“the
bleat of infant Sitwells baying at the moon”
—we listen in vain for the arresting word-
music of a Tennyson, the mellifluent lyre of
a Swinburne or even the faded audacities
of a Wilde. Certainly Paris, with its at-
mosphere of ideas, movements and societies,
is still vigorous in poetic output, and Lon-
don, once modest and furtive in its artistic
sympathies, is now the centre of seething
poetic youth. We live in an age of minor
poets.
Just as the cinema and the jazz are anti-
thetic to the wax flowers and antimacas-
sars, so this Georgian Renaissance, as its
poets call the new phase, is largely a reac-
tion against the quiet, sad, crepuscular
music of the late nineteenth century. Wilde,
Symons, Dowson, Richard Middleton and
W. B. Yeats—all have sung of beauty and
the love of beauty: the charming melan-
choly of old things, the sunsets and the
dreams. Their concern was the quest of
beauty: they shut out the noise and bustle
of a mechanical, prosaic and “progressive”
world, and in haunting, exquisitely musical
verse sought the Rose of undying Beauty,
whose concern is only with “the ardors
and the hungers of the soul.” Present-day
bards have tried to stir a new life into
poetry. They show a healthy contempt for
precedent and commonplace ideas. The
essential aim in poetry used to consist of
finding a balance between an idea and the
technical beauty expressing that idea. Willi-
out ideas poetry becomes a mist of melli-
fluent sounds: without beauty of expres-
sion it degenerates into the banality of
rhetoric. The new poets are in most cases
surfeited with ideas, which overwhelm them
like the serpents of Laoeoon. Dazzled by a
multiplicity of aspects they swoon at the
feet of the Muses. They flounder, with un-
strung lyres, on the hot-beds of pregnant
moods. And in consequence we have an
“orgy of undirected abnormality.”
Bang! Bump ! Tong!
Petticoats,
Stockings,
Sabots,
Delirium flapping its thigh-bones;
Red, blue, yellow,
Drunkenness steaming in colors;
Red, yellow, blue,
Colors and flesh weaving together,
In and out, with the dance,
Coarse stuffs and hot flesh weaving together;
Pig’s cries white and tenuous,
White and painful,
White and
Bump!
Tong!
Might confusion be pushed further?
Such desperate strivings after cleverness
naturally lead to eccentricity and ex-
travagance. Young aspirants of but medi-
ocre talent, foredoomed to sterility, have
found that to be taken seriously they have
only to become unmetrical and incoherent.
The older forms, the ballads and the villan-
elle, are almost dead; the sonnet, most
popular in its irregular form, is often a
barren vagary in 14 lines; and vers lihre,
whose possibilities are still in the clouds, is
largely a plethora of platitudes:—
Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions.
Let us express our envy of the man, with a steady job
and no worry about the future.
You are very idle, my songs,
I fear you will come to a very bad end.
You stand about the streets. You loiter at corners
and ’bus-stops;
You do next to nothing at all.
You do not even express our inner nobility,
You will come to a very bad end.
And I? I have gone half-cracked.
Apart from a number of such absurdities,
the Georgians have usually something to
suy: they all have had visions—sometimes
disconcerting; but they wilfully hold up
their mirrors at obtuse angles. And in con-
trast to the flashlike effects of the Sitwell
family and their colleagues, Wilfrid Gibson,
Walter de la Mare and John Drinkwater
bear along the more normal torch of poetry.
Masefield, Binyon and Abercrombie are still
welcome above the younger trumpetings;
while D. 11. Lawrence, though we may not
care for all the strange amorous blossoms
he has culled from the perilous undergrowth
of psycho-pathology, and though his harsh
cacophonies and slovenly technique may dis-
turb ears not at all delicate, is a force not
only in modern poetry but in fiction also.
His poetry has that strong flavor of mili-
tant honesty, an extraordinary and vivid
sensibility and restless energy producing
rather hybrid verse, a poetic shorthand, that
makes for a strange and subtle intensity.
Someone has said that we carry the world’s
past under our skins. A literary production
therefore does not depend on chance; it is
the result of the poet’s projected ideal or
vision, and is at bottom a personal voice.
Beneath the veneer of civilisation, through
the poet’s early reading and training, the
vicissitudes of his life and work, his pas-
sions and conflicting emotions, we can trace
the old desires and demands working through
the great influence of heredity. Though m
this age of poetic experiment, amid the
luxuriant confusion of aspiring tongues,
much verse is simply a tilting at tradition
and a striving after a new medium, in a
world sour-sodden with w 7 ar, with polities
and social life shuddering before an abyss
of anarchy, Georgian poetry bears the indel-
ible imprint of Tradition flung headlong into
the maelstrom of Change.
REG. S. ELLEBY.
Fame and the Long-distance
Singer
No poet of them all has quite such a hold
upon the heart and imagination of the
lovers of English letters as John Keats;
yet none of his volumes of verse reached a
second edition until he had been dead many
years. Shelley had difficulty in finding a
reputable publisher; and the Olliers, who
issued most of his best work, went out of
business the year of his death. Only “The
Cenci” reached a second edition during his
lifetime. The best sellers in poetry often
take a very long time to start; for the
public is generally about 20 years finding its
permanent favorite. The only way in which
the poet can get even is to live a very long
time. Tennyson found rhymes for 60 years,
and in that time saw his fame rise and fall
and rise again; Crabbe started writing in
1781 and stopped in 1785, but 22 years later
found himself in something like demand,
started again and wrote for another 11 years,
and finally sold his interests in all his rem-
nants to Murray for £3OOO. Byron helped
him at the beginning of his second lap by
calling him “nature’s sternest painter,
but her best” —which he wasn’t. Words-
worth went on so long that people at last
took him seriously, and Browning also scored
as a long-distance stayer ; but Edward Fitz-
gerald, dying in 1883, had very little idea
of the hold which his “Omar.” published in
1559, when he was just 50 years of age,
would have upon the young person from
about 1890 onwards. On the other hand,
Samuel Rogers went for 92 years and pub-
lished verse that was greatly admired for
30 of them, but his fame went out almost as
completely as that of Kirke White, who died
at 21 of consumption and Southey’s unrea-
sonable boosting. Southey himself wrote
without pause from 1801 to 1837 —a period
which included the entire working lifetimes
of Byron, Shelley and Keats, with a long
lap over at each end. Lowell published his
first verses in 1842, and his last —among the
best things he ever wrote —were in proof
when he died in 1891. He was so young then
that in another 20 years he might have been
among the immortals. John Dryden pro-
duced a steady stream of verse for 42 years,
and his best-remembered work, “Alexander’s
Feast,” was written in the year of his death.
Chaucer started it all by writing for at least
30 years and then leaving his greatest work
unfinished; but Shakspeare made the pace
hot for less than 20 years and threw down
his pen at least three before his death.

The Romance of Ludendorff
It was lately mentioned in the cables
that the ricketty and unreliable Ebert Gov-
ernment was “looking for” Ludendorff, who
is at present missing and is suspected of
having fled to Denmark. There is sureiy no
more interesting man than Ludendorff to
look for to-day. There is no man who has
played for such stakes or come so near win-
ning. Just two years ago he was standing
behind the biggest attack with the biggest
armed force that history has known. If he
had won he would have been the world’s
military dictator, for Hindenburg during
1918 was little more than a figurehead. Even
at the start—even in the great German days
of ’l4 and ’15 —it was the Ludendorff and
not the Hindenburg brain that planned the
masterpiece of Tannenberg, and started the
operations that led to the overthrow of
Russia and the crumpling up of Roumania.
From March to June, 1918, it looked as
it Germany, victorious in the East, was
going to overwhelm the West. And Ger-
many, in those critical days, was Luden-
dorff. There was really no one else. Of
course there were leaders of armies like
Rupprecht and Billow and Van Arnim, but
they were all over-lorded by the big man,
who moved them where and how he liked,
and whose glance took in the whole Euro-
pean battle-front, from the Channel ports to
Alsace and from the line of the Piave to
the Carpathians. He knew well enough at
the beginning of 1918 that things were get-
ting desperate, but he knew, too, they were
not hopeless. And he had still from five
to six million. troops to play with, all of
whom retained much of the old Juncker
pride, and most of the Juncker efficiency
that had made Germany what it was. So
he struck for empire in March two years
ago—struck so hard, with such masterly skill
and strategy, with such a terrific fighting
force, that for some breathless weeks it
looked as if this was the knock-out, as, it
-certainlv would have been if Foch had been
less skilful, if Britain and France had been
less resolute, if the U.S.A. had not hurried
up, and if Australia had not stood in front
of Amiens. If only one out of half a dozen
things had gone wrong for the Allies, if they
had flinched at all or cringed at all, Luden-
dorff would have been in Paris by Easter,
and “Germany Over All” would'have meant
much the same thing as Ludendorff over
Germany.
The man who is refuging somewhere in
Denmark —probably in a second-hand lodg-
ing, and being asked for a reference by his
landlady—must think pretty often of these
things. The Ebert crowd suspects him of
being mixed up with the recent Royalist
affair. Probably the Ebert crowd is right. It
is the sort of attempt he would be mixed up
in. How could his Memoirs, the story of the
chief actor in such a drama, be anything but
interesting? If Hannibal had written the
story of the Punic Wars, even a modern pub-
lisher would feel safe in offering him some-
thing on account; and Ludendorff played
with bigger stakes and for a wider empire
than Hannibal. Partly for that reason his
book is the most valuable one on the war. It
can hardly be said to have a second. He tells
the story of 1918, with what hopes it began,
and through what vicissitudes it was carried ;
there occurs the famous admission : “August
8 was the black day of the German Army ia
the history of the war,” with its supplemen-
tary explanation that “the English attacked
south of Arras, mainly with Australian and
Canadian troops”; and from August to
October the story of defeat is told in detail.
From August 8 onwards he knew quite well
it must be defeat, but his object was to keep
up the stoutest resistance and make the big-
gest display of force in the hope that the
German Government would be able to
negotiate some sort of peace. This the
Ministers had to do, and between the lines
you can see that he was bitterly disap-
pointed. If their negotiating had been as
good as his fighting—which it wasn’t, by a
b ng chalk —there would have been no “peace
of destruction” at Versailles. This is his
account of the closing scene
On the 27th of October I stood in Spa, in full
possession of my faculties, at the end of a military
career which had brought me an enormous field of
labor, and with it responsibility such as falls to
the lot of few men. ...In the evening I left Spa.
In Aix-la-Chapelle I sought out my first war quar-
ters. I thought of Liege. There I had staked my
manhood and had not changed since. My muscles
braced themselves —I went back home.
It is not exaggerated, this remark about “re-
sponsibility such as falls to the lot of few.”
He might have said “very few” or “none”
and still been safe. For four years he car-
ried in his hands the fate of empires and
the lives of millions; and on October 27,
1918, he heard the whole lot thundering
about his ears. But he shook himself free
of the ruins—and went home. One is in-
clined to hope that the Danish landlady will
not be too exacting in the matter of refer-
ences. But it might be bad policy to give
him cakes to watch.

The Inky Way
The Australian Rose Book, written by R.
G. Elliott and published by Whitcombe and
Tombs, with 70 half-tone illustrations, is
already on the market; and the only com-
plaint this page has to make is that the
hand-drawn illustrations are not better done
and the photographs not in color. Now
Robertson’s are advising their patrons to
book orders for Russell Grimwade’s Anthoy-
raphy of the Eucalypts, which will also oe
profusely supplied with pictures. Everybody
in amateur horticultural society is talking
of these books, and that society enlarges
every year. These times one has to be able
to talk roses and pretend to a smattering of
knowledge about gum-trees, or count as a
Goth.
The foreign profiteer is killing them one
by one. Forbes (N.S.W.) has just seen the
last of its Times, aged 60. The Advocate
now speaks for both. “Breaker” Morant
worked for the Times for a while; and
though Parkes found him a bit of a strain,
it proudly recalls its association with the
erratic daredevil.
“C.C.8.” : Our Supreme Court Judges, like
everyone else, come in for a good deal of
abuse. But Harrison Owen, in his “Mount
Marunga Mystery,” touches them on a spot
where I had always thought they were be-
yond reproach—their personal cleanliness.
On page 127 he says: “The trial began on a
warm Spring morning, and even before the
Judge had taken his seat on the Bench the
atmosphere of the Court was far from
pleasant.”
“N.”: After we had discussed the new
tariff, and I had joined in the chorus of
noises approving the virtues of preference
to Britain. I went on reading Compton Mac-
kenzie’s “Sylvia and Michael.” At last I
saw something ahead that looked like a
capital A for Anzac, and read this: —
They accused England of decadence, but had you
seen that landing last April, that immortal division
of Englishmen, Scotsmen, Irishmen and Welshmen
literally dyeing the sea with their blood, you would
never have thought of decadence again. And yet
so much of England was lost upon that day that
already the unthinking herd, led by the newspapers,
which are always waiting to hail the new king,
talks of the landing as famous chiefly for the Aus-
tralian share in it. My God, it enrages me to read
about the Australians !
There is no further reference to them.
“Yours Truly” : It is sweet to see the Red
Page reviewer summing up Havelock Ellis’s
last book as “a good deal of piffle.” I met
the man many times in the years before
1887, when he was occupied on literary hack-
work for Walter Scott, who recently died
leaving over a million of money. For him
he “edited” the Mermaid Series of Old
Dramatists, which brought in much gold.
He told me that he had spent five years as
a school-teacher in N. S. Wales. He never
expressed an original idea, but was always
ready to produce someone else’s from the
British Museum Library. This led to his
publication of a collection of sexual aberra-
tions which have to be printed in the
U.S.A. The latest heard of these is in its
fifth edition, and six volumes are already
out. His other volumes contain nothing
but commonplace in common language.
“Last Lap” : With the cost of paper what
it is, and scores of old-established country
sheets threatened with extinction, it is a
bit exasperating to see those three great
monopolists, the Age, Argus and Melbourne
Herald, coming out with 26, 28 and 30 pages
a day. For quite a number of Saturdays
the Argus has been flaunting its 30 pages
in the face of poor devils of proprietors and
handy-men editors who are only one remove
from the unemployed ranks, and are expecting
to get there soon. But as Hughes has
been struck dumb, blind and paralytic by
the Referendum vote —or wants it to be
understood that he was—it seems useless ex-
pecting anybody to do anything.
There is some doubt whether the English
translation of the Russian navigator Bell-
ingshausen’s account of his Antarctic voyage
will see publication this year to celebrate
the centenary of his visits to Sydney, Maori-
land and Macquarie Island. The British
Admiralty has the translation ready, but the
shortage of paper and other troubles make
the printing uncertain.
“Black Bonnet”: What language do I
think in ? None at all! My thoughts are ar.
impression. Language only comes when the
pen is put to paper, or the tongue begins to
articulate. The writer gets his ideas. They
are in neither English nor French nor
Chinese. He only begins to think in a lan-
guage when he begins to consider how he will
express himself.


TO MARK 1920.
£.550 CASH.
The GREAT AUSTRALASIAN NOVEL
First Prize, £3OO. Second Prize, £l5O Third Prize, £lOO
Being ardently and enthusiastically
interested in all things Australasian,
and
Being confident that this Great Young
Country contains the mental genius and
all the material and scope for the pro-
duction of
A LITERARY MASTERPIECE,
equal—if not superior— to any of
THE GREATEST NOVELS OF
THE OLDER WORLD,
I am glad to be able to offer a monetary
incentive towards the production of
A REALLY GREAT
AUSTRALASIAN NOVEL.
CONDITIONS:—
1. Author must be Australasian born.
2. No Entry Fee Whatever.
3. Not to exceed 100,000 words, nor
to be less than 75,000, and to be written
or typed on one side only of paper.
4. TO BE ESSENTIALLY AND
TYPICALLY AUSTRALASIAN. This
is not to mean specialisation in “The
Bush,” “The Outback,” or “The Never-
Never.” These are certainly phases of
Australasian life, but Australasia also
contains all the elements of comedy,
drama, romance and mystery, and all the
scenic, social, artistic, financial, domestic,
commercial and athletic attributes of up-
to-date civilisation.
5. To reach me on or before 30th
September, 1920.
IMPORTANT—Prize-winner’s Option.
The Prize-winners—if they prefer—instead of accepting the advertised cash prizes,
may, in lieu thereof, accept a royalty on the book, stage and cinema rights, of their
successful work.
That decision will rest with each Prize-winner for one month after the prizes have
been awarded.
With this proviso, the whole of such rights shall be mine.
The purpose of the cash prizes is to give authors a definite cash incentive as a reward
for the merit of their efforts.
All prize-winning novels will be published, wholly printed, set up and illustrated in
Australasia.
Unsuccessful novels will, if possible, and where worthy, and with author’s consent,
also be submitted for publication.
Address to C. J. DeGARIS, Box 130, Mildura, Victoria,
whose decision, either personally or through duly appointed representatives, shall be
final and absolute.
NOTE.—This has nothing whatever to do with the “SUN-RAYSED” Campaign.
It is purely the gratification of a PERSONAL HOBBY, and the testing of a long-
cherished belief in the abilities of the Australasians in Literature, as in every other phase
of mental and physical endowment, where OPPORTUNITY has been greater and
encouragement more practical.
Authors’ names and addresses to be clearly stated on MSS. Established reputations
will not affect the adjudication.
Merit will be the decisive factor.
It may, and probably will, develop into the establishment of an Australasian
Publishing House, particularly designed to encourage all forms of genuine Australasian
Literature.
Intending competitors are requested to advise me as early as possible that they will
be competing, so that I may form an idea of the quantity of MSS. to be dealt with.

Happiness
A***?*"-
The way to radiate happiness
is to be happy—the way to be
happy is to cultivate good health
An easy way to cultivate good health and happiness is to acquire
certain simple habits of life. The Kruschen Habit is a simple
habit—it is quite simple to drink a tumbler of hot water with a
half-teaspoonful of Kruschen Salts in it every morning on rising
for a few weeks at a time. Yet this simple habit makes for
health and happiness as nothing else does—for it cleanses the
system, purifies the blood, and tones up mind and body to. the
acme of efficiency. “ The difference between an optimist and a
pessimist ”, it has been well said, “is a dose of Kruschen
Salts ! ” Get the Kruschen Habit—persevere with it—and
prove this saying for yourself. It is the safe, sure road to health
and to the happiness that health confers.

And at Paris.
The Yanks can take a back seat. Luden-
dorff states in bis “Memoirs” that the war
was won by the Italians at Vittorio Veneto.
General Conrad von Iloltzendorff takes the
same view.
Gen. Birdwood was handed one unique
token during his Tasmanian cruise. He
laid the foundation-stone of Waratah’s war
memorial with a trowel made of tin, mined,
milled, smelted and manufactured in the
neighborhood by the Mt. Bisckoff Co.
Truck-shortage complaints, Vic. Railway
Minister Barnes declares, are giving Minis-
ters congestion of the brain. It seems a
fair thing, seeing that Ministers are respon-
sible for the State suffering from the same
disease, without which there wouldn't be
any truck-.shortage to complain of.
Herbert Macdoweli, who came into the Vic.
service a curly-headed lad 46 years ago and
climbed up to the job of Chief Clerk of the
Chief Secretary’s Department, has i-etired.
Having married a rich wife he had never to
worry about the threepenny-bits. C. S.
McPherson, Chief Clerk of the Education De-
partment, is likely to succeed Macdoweli,
and, if lie makes good, will take the Under-
Secretaryship in succession to Callaway,
whose time to retire is just about due.
Prime Minister Hughes advertises that lie
will not be responsible for debts contracted
in his name without his written authority :
Checked his last wages-slieet at Caulfield
(Vic.), George W. Ward, a prominent
figure of the Vic. Country Press and as
white a boss as ever signed a cheque. He
was born near Ballarat when the goldfields
counted, went to Horsham Times as a boy,
was appointed manager at 21, and became
proprietor a few years later. For 40 years
lie lived in the mud and dust of the Wim-
mera, and the only man he ever had a
hard word with came along as he was leav-
ing and said that it was all a mistake. Not
a writer himself, Ward nevertheless had a
critical sense that often saved the situation.
Under a giant Moreton Bay fig-tree that
makes a tent of leaves in Sydney Botanic
Cardens two men were filling a pit with
tufts of grass. “Paspalum!” explained the
gardener with a wave of the hand at the
sunlit lawn where little bare patches showed
like scars amid the green. “It is keeping
us busy, and that lawn on the slope is
practically gone. Nothing to be done but
root it out, bit by bit, and bury it here in
the shadow.” So the great Moreton Bay
holds its green umbrella over the misplaced
fodder, and Mother Earth is forced to swal-
low her mistake.
“Palm Tree” : “Bisco” tells The Bulle-
tin (18/3/’2O) that the natives at the
Melanesian Headquarters at Norfolk Island
are housed in a large compound. That is
not quite so. They are taught and have
their sleeping quarters in large European-
style houses under the control of a white
man; and the houses are dotted about in
beautiful grounds. They have for play-
houses and day quarters huts built by them-
selves ; and naturally boys from one district
congregate together. The language spoken
—or which used to be spoken—was the
language of the island of Mota, in the Banks
Croup: this was chosen by Bishop Patte -
son as being the most suitable for a com-
mon language.
The dreadful effects of the increased tariff
dues on housewives’ supplies have been
demonstrated by the Argus, which has pub-
lished a list of domestic items mentioned in
the revised schedule. Here they are: Beef
extract, clothes-pegs, culinary acids, desic-
cated cocoanut, Epsom salts, jelly crystals,
matches and tinned fish. The brutal action of
the Federal Government in thus taxing the
bare necessaries of life means that the house-
wife must modify her slatternly tinned-fish
habit and use up more cold meat; pay an extra
penny per lb. for the quarter-lb. of cocoanut
she uses every month ; start an agitation for
the local manufacture of clothes-pegs rather
than pay an additional Id. a doz. for im-
ported supplies; and, if she wishes to avoid
paying id. more on each purchase of jelly
crystals and beef-extract from foreign places,
depend on Australian production for her sup-
plies, with onl.v a dozen local brands of ox-
essence to choose from; and buy Australian
cooking-acids and Epsom salts as well. It’s
a distracting outlook, isn’t it?
“Georges Le Blank” finds Billy’s double:
1 met Billy Hughes’s double in my -travels. He
was Mouharrem Bey, Vali of Konia (Asia Minor) in
’lB, and before that Vali of Sivas, where he earned
fame as a ruthless destroyer of Armenians. I first
saw him at a reception given him on the Konia
railway-station after a trip to Constantinople, and
immediately the wild idea ran through my head
that the little man, in the battered fez and the
dingy frock-coat, who was bowing and smiling at
the fulsome speeches of his subordinates, was none
other than our Billy, who had managed to pass
himself off on the unsuspecting Turks as a Vali
(Governor-General), and was doing his bit for the
Empire a.s a secret-service agent. The slight figure,
with the rounded shoulders, tiro small eyes, the
long nose, the high cheek-bones, the scraggy mous-
tache, the firmly-closed mouth, the slightly-retreating
chin and the decidedly-outstanding ears, exactly
matched my recollection of the Prime Minister of
Australia. In justice to Mouharrem Bey I must
add that, despite his reputation as a murderer of
Armenians, he was the best of all the Turks I came
across during my captivity, and they weren’t all
bloodthirsty savages. Even while the war-feeling
was at its height Mouharrem Bey specially interested
himself in the comfort of the European prisoners.
This benevolent disposition towards Europeans was
hard to reconcile with his ferocious attitude towards
Armenians; but it must be explained that, when
he was only a minor public official, his only brothel'
fell into the hands of some Armenians, who, after
torturing him, nailed horseshoes to his naked feet
and harnessed him to a cart by driving nails through
his hands on to the shafts. That, anyhow, i s the
story; and if it is true, as Mouharrem Bey swears,
his decided bias on the Armenian question is at
least understandable.
Plain citizens like William Hughes
Quite justifiably refuse
To pay debts by some cunning ruse
Contracted in their name.
This ought to make Australia muse
Upon the cash that William “blews,”
And issue warning to the Jews
That she will do the samel


In spending large sums of money in
seeking the goodwill of the public for
any article, unless the quality is
behind the goods the money is wasted. It
costs much more than the profit on any article of
common sale to induce the first purchase. The profit
comes when the person is satisfied and continues a
customer. This is the secret of the success of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. People once try them
and then continue to use them regularly. From time
to time other so-called remedies are boomed and tried,
but soon found to be ineffective, and prompt return to
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills is made, with gratify-
ing results. For many years this remedy has been
in constant use in Australasia. Families have grown
up with scarcely any other medicine in the house,
and the present generation looks back from childhood
to having had their mothers give Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills if they showed indications of being out of
sorts. To-day the remedy stands higher than ever before in the
esteem of thousands as a good dependable article of the highest
class, sold at a reasonable price within the reach of all classes.

ship owned bv the Westralian Government,
the Black Swan, and that was 55 years ago.
One of the best-known men in Maoriland’s
Civil Service, George Allport, secretary of
the Marine Department since 1903, was cut
down by Death on the steamer Ulimaroa
en route from M.D. to Sydney last trip. In
the early evening he was yarning in the
lounge, in good health apparently. Then
his heart failed, and he died straightaway.
He was a native-born Maorilander, 67 years
of age, and had been just on 45 years in the
service.
News item from Sydney D.T. (25/3/’2O) :
H.M.A. Mine-sweeper Marguerite has returned to
Sydney. While cruising off the Fiji coast during
heavy' weather a stoker, named Hobbs, was lost
overboard. The ship gave a heavy lurch, and he
disappeared over the rail. An interesting break in
the return voy'age was afforded by a call at Norfolk
Island.
Recalls Masefield’s saltwater ballad: “Bill
he’s dead was all they said; he’s dead, and
there he lies.”
Thomas Burgoyne, “Old Logic,” as he was
known at one stage of his political career,
who died in Adelaide lately aged 93, might
have been a conspicuously good artist if he
hadn’t been too busy being architect, brick-
layer, journalist, station-owner, well-sinker,
storekeeper, contractor, road-builder, town
clerk and politician. The best portrait in
existence of the late Tom Price was done
with Burgoyne’s pencil.
“Dial-Sight”: Talking about big bags with
a single shell, a motor-waggon conveying 30
Tommies going on Blighty leave was travel-
ling through Longueval on a road near our
waggon lines. As far as this spot was con-
cerned Fritz had been speechless all day
until a 5.9 shell landed on the road right
beneath the waggon. When the casualties
were sorted out it was found that 15 of the
Tommies would never see Dover again, and
six more had a very poor chance. The only
man not actually hit was the driver.
Fremantle Gaol has lost Kia Sing, who
has passed out at an unknown age after
doing 34 years as the State’s guest. In
ISB6 he was awarded penal servitude for
life. Twenty years ago he was offered his
ticlcet-of-leave, but. he had found the prison
so like a home that he refused to quit, and
since that time has been treated as a pauper.
Once he was>shot out, but he got back next
day—all his friends were inside. For years
he had spoken hardly a word, making him-
self understood by signs.
“Snell” : Royalty seems to be really in the
picture business, too. There are half a
dozen pros., with Doug. Fairbanks as the
most notable example, whose “pull” consxsts
largely of an ingratiating grin; and almost
as many of the lady operatives rely upon the
same facial operation for much of the effect
they produce. Eddie Windsor’s smile was
first made noticeable on the “pics.,” and it
seems likely that he had the “office” from
Fairbanks, visually or oracularly, to pull a
pleasant face on all conceivable occasions as
a means of acquiring the affections of the
multitude. Certainly all his pictures since
he landed in America have displayed the
now notorious smile at its utmost expansion,
and it is obvious that in working it he has a
film before his eyes.
Mary Augusta Humphry Ward, who has
died of heart failure, was financially the
most successful woman-novelist that Eng-
land has produced—barring Marie Corelli.
She wrote with authority about persons on
the topmost rung of the British social ladder,
and the suburbs loved her for it. Another
endearing quality was her unflinching Tory-
ism. She was opposed to any extension of
the franchise all her life, and she particu-
larly hated the idea of votes for women.
Her grandfather was Arnold, the great
Rugby schoolmaster, and to him may be
traced, perhaps, her dogmatism and her pon-
tifical absence of humor. Her husband, T.
Humphry Ward, was a notable B.N.C.
(Oxon) fellow half a century ago. The
fame of his tremendous wife overshadowed
him in London, where he spent many years
on the staff of the Times.
The Russian Bolsheviks claim a great deal
for their educational system, and its origi-
nator and head is Vladimir Lunacharsky.
He is the first education reformer to depend
largely for results on the picture-show. Under
Czarism 98 p.c. of the peasants were illiter-
ate. Lunacharsky has got at this class by
interpolating lessons between the ordinary
reels at every show in Russia. An object is
shown on the screen: its written name fol-
lows; and the audience then spells it out. Mil-
lions are alleged to have learned to read in this
way. A mis-spelling on a screen or public
hoarding affects Vladimir as a false quantity
does one of Oxford’s classical dons; only
more so. Sydney Tivoli’s advertisement
curtain, on which T,r excerpt” is spelt “exerpt,”
would be summarily destroyed under his
regime. He and his agents have torn down
acres of inaccurately spelt and ungrammati-
cal posters, and the pedantic tyranny is still
proceeding*
“Fax”: In Melbourne Criminal Court
McArthur, J., passed a commonsense criti-
cism on the much-execrated “stool pigeon”
of American melodrama. The “stool pigeon”
of “Within the Law,” or any other play
where Crime is triumphantly penitent and
killing counts as no murder, appears to be
a professional traitor, plotting to get rob-
bers convicted for conviction’s sake. The
whitewashing of crooks being the first duty
of the plot, the audience easily falls in with,
the suggestion that burglary and homicide
are nice clean misdemeanors compared
with dirty spying. The war, however, has
made many wise to the truth about spying.
“There are two fellows I take my hat off
to,” said one Digger, “the airman and the
spy.” The police, from his Honor’s point
of view, “have a certain right to set traps
for suspected people when it would be more
difficult otherwise to sheet home the crime.”
Considering that the community in general
looks to the law for protection, it should be
able to see- eye to eye with the Judge who
administers the law, and thus regard “stool
pigeons” from the opposite point of view to
that of the “crooks” in American drama,
who have no use for the blanky law what-
ever.


A Woman has the Distinc-
tion of making one of the
longest “Drive A ways” on
Record.
Owing to the long delays in railing Motor
Cars from Manufacturers to Dealers in the
United States of America, many dealers
have adopted the practice of “driving away”
the cars from Dodge Brothers’ factory to
their eventual destination.
Many thousands of miles are covered in
this way, and experience has shown that
beyond the wear and tear on tyres, ho damage
results to the machines, the cars being
placed in the hands of expert drivers for
the journey.
Miss Gertrude Kirk, Dodge Brothers
dealer in Placerville, California, has the dis-
tinction of making one of the longest “Drive
Aways” on record. The journey from
Detroit to Placerville, which was fraught
with experiences which would have tried the
courage of any male driver, was completed in
three weeks. The fact that she had faith
enough in the car to undertake such a trip,
needless to say, is having a highly favorable
influence on the prospective owners in her
territory.
Miss Kirk and Mrs. George L. Pavy, both
of whom were returning from France, where
they had seen service as canteen workers,
left the factory September 36.
In lowa they encountered more than 250
miles of road so softened by continual rains
that the mud packed around the steering gear
until it became almost impossible to turn
the wheel. Having crossed the Sierras
through Berthoud Pass, they encountered,
in the midst of the mountains, a foot of
snow, which almost terminated the trip; and
near Lucin, Utah, they were compelled to use
their firearms to drive away the coyotes.
Describing her trip, Miss Kirk wrote: “In
all, I drove, without relief, 3340 miles and
had no trouble with the car. It was a
delightful experience.”
We gather from the Standardised Motors
Limited, Dealers in New South Wales, that
Dodge Brothers Motor Car is an established
favorite with Lady Drivers, the simplicity of
control and the ease in which it can be
handled in traffic relieving the driver of all
nervous strain.

Headline in an evening paper full of
strikes: —
THIEVES BUSY.
Well, thank Heaven, somebody's working !
If those concerned don't grow cold about
it, Melbourne expects to own the largest
pub in the continent, though the Australia,
in Sydney, which is creeping back to I’itt-
street and climbing up to Heaven, will
probably laugh at the claim. A shindykit
is seeking to turn the Grand and the ad-
jacent White Hart into one huge tavern,
warranted to house all the homeless multi-
millionaires we have on our hands.
Told of the late Mary Murray, of Warr-
nambool, who foster-mothered the blacks of
the Fraudingha in station. On one of the
many occasions when her well-known
phaeton and grey pony were surrounded
by beaming abos. who had come into Warr-
nambool for the day, she was asked by one
of her protons to admire a new piccaninny.
Doing so with her usual kindliness, “Aunt
Mary" inquired the new baby’s name, and
was really flattered when the proud mother
replied, “Mary Murray.”
Torpid Albany (W.A.) wants the Royal
Princeling to call so that it may wipe out
the stain left by the historian who wrote up
the present King’s experience when he called
there in 1883. George, then a boy of 16,
went ashore with his brother incog., and a
push gave royalty an unpleasant time,
“slinging off” at its clothes and general
appearance, and making the “chiack” so
willing that the Princes got very anxious as
to what was coming next. However, noth-
ing happened. Nothing has a habit of hap-
pening.
“Forester" : The oldest bit of cut timber
still in evidence in the Speck is probably
the “headstone” of Mary niack, once house-
keeper to Bobby Knopwood, the first chap-
lain of Van Diemen’s Land. Mary died in
1808, and they put over her grave a board
cut from a blue-gum. This is now in the
little museum at the Botanical Gardens,
Hobart, and in a very fair state of preser-
vation, after 112 years. There are a few
headboards from convicts’ graves at Mac-
quarie Harbor, cut from lluon pine, still
about, but they are not a century old.
The Speck’s Government has not got the
steamers for its proposed State service, but
it has a manager ready in William Robinson,
who has for years helped to run Ilolyman
and Sons’ Straits fleet. He is to hold the
job for four years, with a screw rising from
£750 to £O5O, which is a lot of money for a
public servant down in those parts. The
first efforts of the State enterprise, when it
gets boats, will be to run a service to the
Bass Straits Islands, and then it will launch
out into an inter-State business if it has
luck.
Melbourne is hungry for bricks, the recent
marine engineers’ strike having stopped coal
supplies and closed down brickworks; and
“AVhat’s the good?” says Millen, Minister of
Repatriation, when the question of starting
works of their own is raised—“ours would
be shut down like the rest when fuel
couldn’t be got.” So Millen’s Department
is collaring practically all the few bricks
that are being turned out by the private
kilns; and not only must the hous-
ing problem wait, but so must men who
want to hop in, take advantage of the new
tariff and build factory premises.
“The Happy Historian”: If John is the
popular name for the hero (B.
11/12/T9), melodrama writei’s are not
guided by statistics. My list of 200 hang-
ings gives no less than 31 of them to John,
with James second (24), and William a
rope’s length away third. Thomas is six
scaffolds behind fourth; then comes George
with 15 ceremonies. After that they’re
bunched —Pat and Henry 9, Mike 8, Robert
(, Edward and Sam 0, Joe and Charles 5.
Also finished: Enoch, Nathan, Alfred, Daniel.
Ben and Christopher. Philip and Stephen,
the consistently bad men of the melodramas,
were non-starters.
A cry from a Maorilander in France:—
The summer of 1920 is practically our last oppor-
tunity of identifying the graves of our dead. Those
not found then probably never will be. Records are
in existence of many isolated graves, sometimes
with exact map reference; and if (as often happens)
the grave was marked merely with a small piece of
wood with the name pencilled on it, our last chance
of finding it will vanish with the summer.
There are about 2000 cemeteries, and it is quite
impossible for the majority of them to be in good
order within a year. In one there lie over 1000
Maoriland dead. It is clay ground, sunken in parts,
desolate and bleak. Time will remedy this, and
loving hands from overseas; but those who make
early visits must be prepared to find many graves un-
tended. The responsibility rests with our own people,
who have done little or nothing, not with the British
authorities, who have struggled with an almost
superhuman task. The Canadians and Australians
did a small amount of their own exhumation work;
the Maorilanders nothing at all. So the letters
“N.Z.” were sometimes misread as “N.F.,” for
Northumberland Fusiliers, or even Newfoundlanders.
Or, again, the first record of the Maorilander was
marked “Anzac,” and subsequently "corrected” to
Australian, and later became A.I.V. And because
Maoriland took so little interest in this work, the
grave of many a Maorilander will be marked with
the pathetic "Unknown.” There are a few
Canadians and Australian cemetery caretakers,
but no M.L. caretakers at all, so far as I know.
There arc also Australian Memorial Parties engaged
in erecting monuments to each Australian Division,
and Australian cross-makers and painters.
A few soldiers’ relatives have visited France and
Flanders, and erected special crosses. Contrary to
what is usually stated, this is quite allowable, pro-
vided that no encroachment is made on adjacent
graves, and that permission has first been obtained
from the British authorities in charge of the
cemetery. Permission is readily granted on con-
dition that the monument proposed is no larger
than the standard cross. Generally speaking, the
original crosses erected by the Battalions or by
comrades have been taken to the cemetery, along
with the body exhumed, and there re-erected. Unless
the cross had perished the new standard one was
not substituted. Where men were originally buried
collectively and the one cross was inscribed with
the names of all those buried below it, no attempt
was made to identify each individual; the bodies
were taken and reburied collectively, and the
original erws re-ereeted, or if it was not in good
condition, another cross was made. on which all
the names were inscribed.

Stopain Toothache Gum
Instantly Ends The Ache
And Helps Save The Tooth.

UVEKMPtI PI£TW?ES
BY
CHAMBERLAINS,
Tablets -
When a child droops.
Children droop, become sickly
and puny, if you permit them to be
constipated.
You know constipation means
that bile, sour fermentations and
constipation poisons are being
absorbed into the system.
You cannot expect a child to be
well when this is going on !
The next time your child is
droopy, picks at its meals and is
fretful, just get out your box of
Chamberlain’s Tablets.
Chamberlain’s Tablets will relieve
the little stomach, liver and bowels
of sour food, bile and constipation
poisons.
They are invaluable for children
and should be kept in every medi-
cine chest.
Watch your child’s health. Look
at its tongue often. If it is coated
white, its breath feverish, stomach
sour, you can always relieve the
trouble and restore the child to
health if you give it a mild and
gentle laxative like
the Stomach o Livep.
Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
ratal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
ana when this remedy is at hand all danger
may be avoided.
15e Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. 1'
never fails to give immediate and permaner
relief.

Le Blond Heavy Duty Gap Bed
Compound Quick Change Engine Lathe
19in. (9|in. centre) x 10ft.
With all-geared Head Single Pulley Drive; Gap Bed with Supplementary Gap Piece; Pan Bed with Oil Pump,
Tank and Piping and Countershaft; also Sprocket Gear and Pinion for direct motor drive if required.
Swing in Gap dia. 31in.
Hole through Spindle Ifin.
Distance Spindle Nose to end of Gap 12in.
The Carriage is securely gibbed both front and rear, and is heavily reinforced to stand the strain incident to
overhanging the gap, turning up work to the face plate without a supplementary piece in the bed. Our experience
has shown us that these blocks are continually getting out of line, and are, therefore, more of a detriment than
an advantage to the Lathe. However, if these are wanted, we can furnish Supplementary Piece in Gap at an
additional cost. The Bridge is extended forward so that the rest will face the full swing of the Lathe in the
Gap at one setting of the tool and without undue strain or chatter. The Carriage Hand Wheel is carried forward
so as not to interfere with the operator. Power Cross Feed is provided to the Compound Rest.
These machines can be equipped with 4-Step Cone and Single Back Gear, or with 3-Step Cone and Double
Friction Back Gear.
We can furnish both Regular Pattern and Heavy Duty Lathes with Gap Bed when so ordered. They have all
the improvements and labor-saving devices of the regular machines, making them very efficient tools.
Prompt delivery. Write for specification and all particulars.

Gallipoli Graves.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“riIHE task of the Gallipoli Graves Com-
mission is now ended.” Reading
that, I once again looked up my
diary, which is all Gallipoli with the ex-
ception of a little quiet Egypt, for I re-
ceived my lead ration on the Peninsula.
There were many more graves than grave-
yards on Gallinoli; for it wasn’t the time
or place to observe the conventions. Yet so
far as Circumstance, whose other name was
Jacko, would permit, they were kept to-
gether ; for the Digger loves a mate. So
one by one—or maybe when the trouble was
black, score by score —they answered the call
at the foot of Shrapnel Gully; and presently
you could not pass by without seeing that
some good cobber had found a mate’s grave—
here was a dried waratah (God knows how
it reached here!), a shrivelled handful of
wattle (many a Digger treasured a sprig), a
few yellow' gum-leaves; often a girl’s photo,
tacked to a rough cross. As you glanced
at them you dodged Beachy Bill and Ana-
farta Lizzie.
A cemetery claims silence. I have stood
in this last home of dead mates while the
noise of many hammers, the rending of boxes,
the curses of the water-guard and associated
noises were in full swing, and yet have felt
the mysterious calm. It is curious to realise
hard to define, but it was there.
Gallipoli contained the unique in profu-
sion, and I hope that the Commission has
preserved some of the many epitaphs which,
mostly written or “printed” on slabs of box-
casing, adorned the graves. My diary alone
contains enough “tombstone” verse to fill a
dozen columns. To append a signature to
an epitaph is unusual; it wuis quite the
common thing at Anzao. Generally an affec-
tionate, ill-constructed verse: —
I have got here, Claude, as you did know,
And I will miss you very much wherever 1 go.
Your brother,
Many of the tributes were signed with
“pen-names”—sometimes a cobber’s ; some-
times it was the dead mate’s “familiar”
name. For instance, above the name
“Ultimo”:—
Gone, as the ladies say, “In bloom.”
I fall—and rot —
And all—for what?
.Startling surely in its directness and simple
strength !
“D.J.F.” possessed a good ear. He evi-
dently endeavored to lighten the gloom of
continuous death, and composed many
epitaphs. I noted this :
A gambler true, a fighter fair,
Famed as the two-up king;
No more he’ll tackle those who dare
_To double-head the ring.
No more the canteen mugs will rattle
As Tom calls for a round,
For he has done his dash in battle,
And won six foot of ground.
And in other strains: —
To read the name, to know the man,
What must the reader say ?
“Nature in making him did plan
His end an easier way.”
Oh, Qyril 1 gentle, soft and kind,
Things surely are not right,
When such sweet souls as you do find
They must away and flight.
Hush, cobber, move softly, step lightly and slow,
For here an Australian soldier lies low.
Firewood was scarce, hence this appeal:—
Stay, sacrilegious hand I Don’t take
This rough-hewn cross away;
The owner died that you might make
A Jocko cross some day.
There was evidently a grin in that last line,
for already the Aussie was a man who jested
with Death.
The serious “Tiatucka” was my favorite.
Hear him :—•
Life’s future has relinquished claim on me,
And I am out of step for evermore.
A dreamless sleep is Nature’s richest gift.
Let Wisdom answer. Were these marble limbs
So sculptured in the roundness of young years,
I'npropagated and unfructified,
To pass to Nothingness? Oh, Keats, to think
A thing of beauty beautiless forever!
The God of War had little claim on me ;
My death but proves the fault of Destiny,
For, scholar of tlie gentle order, I
Lived but to do what good I could, then die.
I knew but little of him; yet he sang,
And laughed and whistled: therefore do I know
That he loved life.
When Allied Earth has conquered Heaven,
And Hell shed tears upon the fray;
Then Man will realise ambition—
But worms are wiser in their way.
“Tiatucka” wrote largely. In sometimes
two, sometimes half a dozen, simple lines
he hands out a halo to each sleeping warrior.
Placed at the foot of the gully, an attempt
had been made to print the lines, but the
stencilled “Biscuits” on the back of the
board won easily.
Surely in this God’s Acre rest
The best of all the brave and best.
R. H. S.
“Centurion”: Mention of Arab swords
recalls that just after El Arish was occupied
one of the subalterns in my squadron came
into possession of a very fine curved sci-
mitar. ivory-handled and silver-scabbarded.
with gold inlay on the blade. That after-
noon a nark order from B.H.Q. was handed
round enjoining all squadron O.C.’s to see
that any native weapons “acquired by offi-
cers or men” were handed in to H.Q. at
once. Souvenirs that had been on view all
the morning vanished suddenly, and the
owner of the scimitar was pained to find
it had disappeared from his bivvy, where
we had been admiring it that morning. As
nobody had anything at all by then, a “nil”
return went in. That night, when the major
lay down to sleep, he found the sand under
his w.p. sheet a bit hard. Rooting a hole
for his hips, he came on the sword, which
hia thoughtful troop-leader had planted there
before taking his affidavit that it wasn’t on
hia premises.

“Karim Khan”: When we did our little
jaunt through treeless Persia wood was
difficult to obtain and always very costly.
At one place a householder obligingly climbed
up on his roof by means of the only ladder
I ever saw in those parts, scraped away the
top-dressing of daub, and tore out a log-
rafter. When I commandeered it at half
the sum demanded he wept bitterly. I
worked out the price afterwards and found
that even then I* had paid the old shark at
the rate of about £SU a cord for half-rotten
poplar.
“U.P.”: At one time Westralian coopers
used nothing except American oak, but for-
tunately that became unobtainable and a
local substitute had to be found. George
Walsh, a Perth man, recently made to order
a number of large karri vats. He found
that the bending capacity of this timber is
much greater than that of most imported
hardwoods. American oak, for instance, is
capable of a 4in. extension in a 7ft. length,
but YVialsh’s experience with karri is that
it will give Gtin. In every other way the
wood has filled cooperage requirements.
• * * *
“Cape Pork” : Let me put in a word for
another good Australian —the messmate, still
plentiful in Queensland, but being slaugh-
tered without regard to its value. When
dressed this timber is equal to the best
spotted gum, and I defy any but the most
experienced timberman to pick it from the
good old spotted gum. It’s just as good,
anyway, so there's no harm done in substi-
tuting it. Can anybody tell me why the Min-
ister for Lands in Bananaland is singing out
about the scarcity of. timber and at the same
time lease-owners are allowed to slaughter
all the young growth of valuable hardwoods
that should be saved for our children? It’s
got .me beaten, anyhow.
“Ilam” : The sensible idea of fighting the
robbers whose highwayman habits help
greatly to increase the cost of living by a
system of open markets deserves to spread.
These markets will be a godsend, not only
to regular producers, but also to the subur-
ban amateur with a glut of vegetables, fruit,
eggs and poultry. I have a personal feeling
in the matter. When moving on one occa-
sion I found it necessary to get rid of a
dozen good fowls; and my net return, after
sending them to a city agency, was 4s. sd.
When I thought of getting some "more poultry
a month or two later I found that.a similar
lot would cost me over £2.
* * .* #
“Copy Boy”; The six-and-eightpenny
brigade spares no pains in attempting to
create the impression that the lawyer is
worthy of his hire. I recently parted from
a house and hired a legal gent, to arrange
the obsequies. The bill covered a sheet of
foolscap and included such items as:
“Attending you handing us documents and
instructing us to act for you”; “Perusing
documents and advising”; ‘‘Drawing and
Engrossing Answers to Requisitions on Title
and Letter forwarding same”; “Perusing
Further Letter from Purchaser’s Solicitors” ;'
“Perusing Deed of Assignment” ; and so on
down to “Attending You Signing Transfer.”
I hastened to pay the bill in case Six-and-
Eightpence discovered that he had omitted
such important items as “Perusing Address
on Letter received by us from Purchaser’s
Solicitors” and “Affixing Postage Stamps to
Envelope Containing Answer to Same.”
* * * *
“Screws”: The remark of “Centurion”
(B. 25/3/’2O) about the Spanish swords
that could be bent round till the point
touched the hilt reminds me of the time when
an old man came into a Hobart shop to
buy one of the butcher’s knives with a tre-
mendously long blade that used to be popu-
lar in the back-country districts of the
Speck. The shop-lad was young and very
green, but full of enthusiasm, and had read
about the Toledo blades. To show the
temper and spring of the steel he bent the
blade round till it almost touched the handle.
Then he released it. To his horror it
stayed there. P.S.—I have sold lots of
knives since then, but my tongue has had
to do all the gymnastics.
* * # *
“Pride”: Mark Wolk, who resides at
Ivanowna (W.A.), aspires to become the
greatest breeder and owner of goats in the
Southern Hemisphere. He has a flock of
more than 1000, and as the animals breed
prolifically and thrive in the driest parts,
he expects to solve the problem of filling
the empty spaces of Australia. Experts de-
clare that the dry goldfields districts would
carry from 3,500,000 to 5i,000,000 goats.
Little capital is required to extend the in-
dustry, particularly in regard to skins, into
a pyramid of wealth, if not to Australians,
certainly to foreign shipping cos., manu-
facturers in alien countries, and local impor-
ters of articles made up from the raw
material.
* # * *
“Forester” : Tasmania has about a dozen
species of conifers, some of which, such as
the Huon pine, King William pine and
celery-top pine, yield as line soft-wood
timbers as are to be found in the world. But
it seems to be only a question of time, and
not very much time, when all that will be
left of them will, be stray specimens in
inaccessible places. They all grow very
slowly. G. Weindor.fer, who has studied the
King William pine belts around Cradle
Mountain pretty closely for nine years,
reckons that the .young tree does not average
a growth qf more than three inches a year.
It has been estimated from the rings that
a pine 3ft. in diameter was 600 years old.
The conifers are exacting in regard to condi-
tions, too. Except the Oyster Bay pine
(Cullitus), which is confined to a long,
narrow strip near the east coast and in the
islands of Bass Straits, they grow only in
the south and west of the island, where the
rainfall is over 50 inches a year, and even
there only in patches. The Huon pine, the
best of the lot, is now hardly to be got,
though it was once yery plentiful along the
Huon. Gordon and King rivers and round
Port Davey. The celery-top holds out best,
but then it has only come on the market
lately, while the Huon pine was exploited
a century and more ago. No doubt it will
go the same way, and when it is practically
extinct there will be talk of conservation.
* * * *
“The Oldest Inhabitant’’: Apropos the
Bathurst Bank (B. 25/3/’2O). At first,
having to cross country well worked by bush-
hangers, specie and notes were brought from
Sydney in strange ways—-in consignments of
table salt, millinery and casks of corn. The
bank prospered and paid splendid dividends.
At length the Union Bank sent up an agent,
who bought out the business at a sum
which gave the shareholders a fine profit.
When the Union took over the liabilities it
paid all the notes of the old bank as they
came in, and then put up those that re-
mained to auction. A speculator secured
them, getting a good figure from the Union;
but he had cause to regret his bargain, as
for years notes dribbled in, and long after
he thought that all had been paid a “tenner”
turned up. He demurred at paying, as so
long a time had elapsed, but finding that no
time limit had been set he paid his 10 sover-
eigns for the grimy piece of paper.
“Forester”: This is an official record of
what a patch of mountain-ash (Eucalyptus
regnans) near Warburton (Vic.) did. A saw-
mill employing 24 men was kept going for
nine months by 12 acres of forest, and turned
out in that time timber worth at the mill
£5OOO, This was before the war; to-day the
same quantity would be worth about £lO,OOO,
or well over £BOO an acre. If it took 100
years to grow the timber (and up about
Warburton the mountain-ash makes pretty
good growth), a yield of £8 an acre a year
is a long way ahead of what could be got
out of the ground in any other way with-
out a very big expenditure. It is on record
that a mountain-ash near Neerim (Vie.l
was split into 10,000 Oft. palings, which
were sold for £ll5.
**•**
“G.P.” : Why don’t the Sydney trams and
boats combine to assist the practical house-
wife to make ends meet in these sad pro-
fiteering times instead of adding to her bur-
den by periodically raising the fares until
the guards on the trams can’t calculate
within fourpence or so how much you owe
them for a one-section ride? Why don’t they
reduce the fares on the trams and boats to
half-price in the dead hours (say, between
1 p.m. and 3 p.m.)? Between these hours
there are generally two men and a dog on
the boats, and two women and no dog on
the trams.; but if the thrifty housewife could
come across the harbor for one penny or
three halfpence at most, and if she could
buy special tram tickets at three farthings
each, with a reduction for . purchasing the*-,
by the dozen, the trams and boats would be
full in no time and an increase of earnings
would result, besides the added convenience
of cheaper shopping for the public.
“KNIVES.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Clack of cups and crash of dishes!
Not one of the staff but wishes
He had other occupation,
Or perhaps a rich relation;
And the knife-wheel ever whirring
Makes a harsh, incessant purring,
Where the woman with the apron
Plies the endless job of “knives.”
Paper flowers on the tables ;
In the air a smell of stables ;
Diners, greedily contriving,
Sneak the sauce from those arriving.
Beef is tough an’ cook is swearing ;
Over all th’ Boss is glaring,
And a woman in an apron
Hears them yelling out for knives!
Hiss of steam and falling platters,
Tearing every nerve to tatters.
“Two roas’ beef an’ one fish curry!”
“Give me notice? I should worry!”
“There’s the lift.” “Take out that mustard!”
“Get th’ milk- —don't spill that custard!”
All about the woman’s apron
liise the piles of greasy knives.
“Knives for downstairs—-they are waiting,”
Comes the call in accents grating.
“Four meat patties—without gristle,”
And the waiter stops a missile
(With his waistcoat) made of mutton
Thrown at him by some gross glutton,
And the woman in the apron
Drops a hundred thousand knives.
“Knives are wanted —ground floor, second ;
Thousands dirty (roughly reckoned),
Piled around in vile confusion,
Give the woman a delusion
That she’s in a noisy Hades
(Not a fitting place for ladies)
lu an ugly sacking apron
Answering the call for “knives!”
Here she toils in bitter passion,
Heedless that she’s out of fashion
In her apron, made of sacking.
And her shoes with laces lacking.
Is the weather dull? Or brighter?
She but grabs the handle tighter;
She’s a slavey in an apron
Answering the call of “knives!”
Thus the day in breathless hurry
Bushes by in heat and scurry
Till she feels she’s past exemption,
She’s in Sheol no redemption.
Camouflaged, the cook’s a devil —
Well she knows lie’s “off the level,”
While she wears a grimy apron
Polishing the devil’s knives.
Yet immutable, though groaning,
Like a human soul a-moaning,
Turns the wheel that takes for ever
Into its inside of leather
Rows of knives all black and greasy
Guaranteed to “clean them easy”
For the woman with the apron
Who is captive to “the knives.”
She’s a helot at this altar;
Never may she stop or falter.
By the yell of “Knives are wanted!”
Well she knows her soul is haunted.
All these knives are greasy fetters,
And she’ll clean them for her “betters”
While she wears a sacking apron
For a million million lives.
VICTORIA.

Can’t Beat Cocoanut
Oil for Hair Wash.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most
soaps and ready-mixed shampoos contain
excessive quantities of alkali. This dries
the scalp, makes the hair brittle and is very
injurious. Just, ordinary colimited cocoanut
oil (a pure, saponified but quite greaseless
liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly use for a shampoo,
for this cannot possibly hurt your hair
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful make a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and
cleanses both hair and scalp thoroughly. The
lather rinses out easily, and takes with it
every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenly,
and comes out fine and silky, bright, glossy
and fluffy, appearing to be heavier than it is.
And, best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. You can
get colinated cocoanut oil at most any chemist,
but be sure it’s “colinated,” which is not
expensive—a few ounces lasting a long, long
time.
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated cocoanut oil, as recommended above.

Apply some drops right on to the heart
of any tender, pain-throbbing corn or
callous. Immediately all soreness van-
ishes. and soon the whole corn, “lock,

There’s no “acid-eating” effect in
Frozol-Ice, but a perfectly non-irritating,
non-inflaming, shrivelling up and loosen-

Only fancy ! No pain ! No soreness !
No sting whilst using Frozol-Ice, nor
afterwards. Make a test of it and satisfy
yourself.
As Soon as Corns Begin to Ache Use

If Favorite Foods
Upset Stomach
Take Magnesia.
If some of the foods you like best do not
agree with you and make your stomach sour
or burn, producing acid indigestion, do not
think you must give up eating these good
things, and do not, either, make the mistake
of swallowing pepsin pills or soda water after
every meal. Instead just make a practice of
taking a teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia
in half a glass of hot water right after eating.
The hot water will force a needed blood
supply to your stomach, and the Salix Mag-
nesia will instantly neutralise any excess of
stomach acid, and your digestion will be
natural and painless. Salix Magnesia is not
a laxative, and its continued use is entirely
harmless, as it never weakens natural diges-
tion. It can be obtained at any well-stocked
chemist’s shop (in powder or compressed tab-
lets form). Be sure to get Salix Magnesia. Do
not use other forms of magnesia for this
purpose.
With Mawson at Macquarie Island.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Since returning to Australia I have been gratified
to learn that, through the representations of Mr.
Frank Hurley and others, Macquarie Island is no
longer leased by the Southern Isles Co., tor the
slaughter of penguins and sea-elephants. From my
own observations —I had the honor to be surgeon
and bacteriologist to the Mawson Expedition—the
oil-trade at Macquarie Island was carried on waste-
fully and with no regard for the future protection
of the rare fauna inhabiting the place. In years gone
by fur-seals worth hundreds of thousands of pounds
were exterminated at Macquarie Island and Ker-
guelen. Not a single specimen can now be found at
either island.
Macquarie Island is a paradise of weird and won-
derful life. Irresponsible sealers, with no sentiment
for the preservation of this unique and unexampled
realm of the biologist, should not be allowed to
run amok in one of the last circum-polar islands
of the world which still remains more or less primi-
tive. Within the next 10 years I venture to predict
it will be visited tourists during- the four months
of summer, when the weather is comparatively calm,
rn the Arctic seas, before the war, the Orient and
German-American lines ran summer excursions to
Spitsbergen during the autumn months. AVhen Aus-
tralian shipping regains its prosperity an enterpris-
ing co. would do well to turn its eyes on Macquarie
Island, or even the northern edge of the Antarctic
ice-pack, with a view to business.
For two years following the return to civilisation
of Mawson’s Antarctic Expedition, the Commonwealth
Government maintained a wireless and meteorological
station on the island. The station was discon-
tinued during the thrifty era of the war. It would be
far-sighted policy to re-establish a permanent colony
on Macquarie Island, both for the protection of the
animals and for the regular transmission of meteor-
ological information.
This account has been written up recently from
my old Antarctic djjiry. — A.L.McL.
AT daybreak on the morning of Decem-
ber 11, 15)11, the low loom of Mac-
quarie Island was visible on the
south-eastern horizon. The Aurora steamed
slowly on until the mist-shrouded outlines
of a long, dark hummock emerged front the
sea. The swell was long and listless. A
gloomy pull overspread the sky.
Soon there was life to assure us of the
close proximity of land. Small, serpentine
heads bobbed up with a splash from tin* dull
water, disclosing the lithe forms of penguins
swimming in shoals about the ship. They
uttered sharp squawks as in increasing num-
bers they leaped and dived to avoid the
bow. From far away came the long-drawn
trumpeting sound of myriads of birds coast-
ing the land. It was an eerie, lorn cry, as
if from the dwellers of a hopeless world of
utter loneliness.
The weather was clearing. The foggy
haze gradually lifted and dissipated under
the freshening east wind. The sun made
fitful glances, disclosing a high ridge rising
for more than one thousand feet and con-
tinuing, far as the eye could see, as the
main plateau of the island. The long western
bastion which opposes the -unresting winter
gales is a scarred and desolate slope. The
snow and rain of the upland waste come
streaming down the rough wedges cut in
the precipitous cliffs. With glasses we could
discern small cataracts and streaming water-
falls that whitened the bed of the dark cre-
vices. Then, as eyes followed downwards
the field of view, the brown volcanic rocks
rose sharply from the reef-fringed water-
line. Great patches of seething foam marked
the wash and impact of the ponderous bil-
lows. Half a mile from the shore curved an
irregular girdle of black, lumpy peaks, set
relentlessly to brave the geysers of spray.
Discovered by Captain Hasselborough in
1810, this lonely spot was found to be popu-
lated thickly by thousands of fur-seals. The
ruthless sealers of two seafaring nations,
British and American, came in force, and.
without compunction, since no official pro-
tection was exercised, the race of fur-bearing
animals was practically exterminated within
a few years. After this slaughter was com-
pleted, Macquarie Island was exploited on
account of the oil-producing sea-elephants
and penguins which live in prodigious num-
bers along the foreshores. From 1813 on-
wards the advent of sealing-ships has been
wholly connected with cargoes of oil, and
the history of this British possession is
mainly obscure and traditional.
It was midday before the Aurora had
cruised along the whole length of the western
coast —some 20 miles in extent —and had
reached the southern extremity of the island.
The clouds, meanwhile, had cleared from
the south, and South-West Point was limned
black against a luminous arch of open sky.
Captain Davis stood in as close as he
dared and a whaleboat was lowered. Maw-
son and 11 of us boarded it. We steered to-
wards a high point of the rocky shoreline
which hid apparently the inlet of Caroline
Cove. A small land-locked harbor came
presently in sight. Above rose an amphi-
theatre of hills which were overlooked by
the plateau of the island. All were in tre-
mendous spirits, after their spell on the ship,
at the novel prospect which lay ahead. We
were soon overcome with the wonder of it all.
No sooner was the whaleboat inside the
calmer waters of the Cove than the cliffs
on the south side engaged everyone’s atten-
tion. Grey walls with narrow ledges in a
long series to the top; penguins in their
hundreds filling every crevice; an incessant
discharge of squawks and plaintive cries
coming in a discordant din from the vast
concourse of birds. Here and there one noted
rockhopper or gentoo penguins ensconced in
narrow niches like small, white statues.
Their breasts were conspicuous in the burst-
ing sunlight. Those which had just leaped
dripping from the sea on to the rocks near
by stood in vague wonderment, watching the
boat pass, a bright sheen glancing from each
feathered front. In the water around there
was ample life. The penguins leaped, dived
and disappeared, racing to avoid the oars
and scared at our excited shouts. Each new
discovery was hailed by a cry from the dis-
coverer. Every moment there was some fresh
novelty.
On the wave-washed ledge of tabular reefs
groups of Dominican gulls stood in pure
white beauty. The shoals of splashing pen-
guins became more and more numerous.
The greyish-brown giant petrels were de-
scried swimming with measured slowness
among their livelier companions. The shores
were closing in on either hand. On the
south side the land rose in knolls and gently-
rolling hills covered with grassy tufts of
vivid green. Ungainly dark masses of huge
size moved amongst the tussocks close to
high-water mark. They were recognised as
sea-elephants and a few smaller animals as
seals. The climax of our excitement was
reached when the boat, throwing aside
scores of noisy penguins, all with flippers
vibrating in scurrying haste, grounded on a
pebbly beach at the bead of the cove.
The boat’s crew were soon out in the
midst of droves of royal penguins, flying
and scrambling to right and left at their
approach. The majority of the fantastic
and comical congregation were, however, so
overcome with curiosity that they gathered
round our legs and peered up with sober
eyes at these new creatures they had never
seen before. Then they became attracted by
bootlaces and trousers and made exploratory
pecks. We moved ahead and tried to stroke
the more amenable birds, only to find that
they stood on the defensive immediately
with whirring flippers and sharp beaks.
Handsome little fellows they were, waddling
about clumsily on webbed feet! The smooth
pearly breast, the mauve feathery back, the
head crested with brown and golden feathers,
the dark-blue eyes ringed with white —all
these peculiarities we admired, and thought
this grotesque bird, with his one foot of
stature, well named the royal penguin.
Down on the beach, Hurley, in a kind of
photographer’s ecstasy, was striving to do
justice to his phenomenal surroundings. Torn
between the claims of cinematograph and
camera, he rushed about using each by turns.
The penguins clustered in force around the
legs of the tripod, pecking away busily at
the bright brass points and coming continu-
ally into fighting collision with Hurley’s
feet as he traversed about the instrument,
securing a moving picture of Caroline Cove
and its life. Then the enthusiast would make
for the nearest high ground in the vicinity to
command a more comprehensive view with
the reflex camera. Each hurried journey he
made through the closely-packed ranks of
the penguins left a trail of quarrelling, clam-
oring birds whose hoarse and voluble (-mak-
ings were taken up by every individual
within range, till, even to those of us who
were on the cliff, the noise was deafening.
Then a number of sea-elephants came lollop-
ing down from the tussocks above the beach.
They opened their mouths and bellowed above
the din of the penguins, which made way
quickly for these monsters. At last they
stopped, the penguins closed around them,
and we came down quickly over the wet and
spongy tussocks to examine them at close
quarters.
Enormous masses of blubber covered their
bodies. One cow, larger and fiercer than
the others, raised itself high on the hind
part of the body and stood in a menacing
attitude, roaring its loudest and distending
its nostrils. A massive creature, with a
leathery and wrinkled skin, it was at least
14 feet in length and weighed more than
two tons. The other cows also showed
their displeasure by opening their mouths,
displaying formidable teeth and uniting their
weaker bellowings with the roars of the
largest cow. We walked up the beach and
found a dark, rocky cavern in the sandy
floor of which wallowed a cow and calf.
Both were in great trepidation at being dis-
covered. Then, at Hurley’s bidding, we pro-
vided a more animated picture for the cine-
matograph. This was accomplished by stir-
ring up the sea-elepliants, in their environ-
ment of penguins, with a few small stones?
With some difficulty they were persuaded
to push through the penguins and take to
the water, creating confusion, instant and
widespread. The only cause for regret was
that the general hullabaloo of protestation
which arose from all the animals remained
unrecorded on Hurley’s film.
Along the line of the shore there was
much to be seen. Nests of cormorants were
found on rocky ledges on the north side of
the cove. The southern bank ran back for
a considerable distance as a plain of swamnv
tussock. So great is the precipitation of mois-
ture on Macquarie Island that the ground
is saturated with water, and in order 1
avoid the quagmires one jumps from head
to head of the tussock grass. Maori cab-
bage, succulent and bright green, was
observed amongst the tussocks. Sea-elephants,
always gregarious, lay walloping in the
muddy spaces between the patches of grass.
They looked indescribably filthy, rolling
about in luxurious enjoyment or sleeping
peacefully. Between the massive bodies of
the cows the smaller calves, daubed in the
common mire, were scarcely visible. In
isolation from these torpid masses of flesh,
a few drowsy Weddell seals, more cleanly
and rather handsomely marked with green-
ish-yellow patches. Then, too, we accosted
fierce and spotted sea-leopards, which lifted
their cruel and ponderous heacfs, exhibiting
open mouths and rows of pointed teeth.
They were slow in their movements, and easy
to avoid. Mawson photographed fluffy white
chicks of the giant petrel which had made
their nests on low. mounds amongst the tus-
tock. Every minute Maori-hens escaped
from shelters close to our feet and made off,
long-legged and rapid, through the clumpy
maze of grass. Brown skua-gulls with
white-tipped wings flopped along in lazy
night or scolded viciously when surprised on
their nests. Small wonder, moving amid this
prodigality of bizarre and changing life,
that we thought we had realised at last
the Sindbad of our dreams!
Next morning the Aurora made steam to
the north along the Western Coast, rounded
North Head and arrived in North-east Bay.
The hill forming the headland stands as an
isolated eminence, 3000 ft. high, separated by
a low, narrow isthmus, three-quarters of a
mile in length, from the main part of the
island. Not far from the southern extremity
of the isthmus were observed two huts, shel-
tered by the hills behind from the prevail-
ing westerly storms. IVe had not long to
wait for signs of life. One man sighted the
Aurora and rushed back to his hut to tell
the others, who, to the number of six or
more, came running out to view the strange
ship. They thought we were Norwegians
who had come to dispute their sealing claim,
.and brought out a spar on which a Union
Jack was raised. The Aurora responded with
the same flag, and they were reassured. Then
semaphore signals put u s in touch with one
another; the sealers learning our identity
and business. The sealing herdsmen and
head of the station came aboard. A well-
built man of German nationality, he made
rather a picturesque figure as he stepped on
deck, with his flowing red beard, blue eyes
and ruddy cheeks.
The Toroa, making a quick passage from
Hobart, arrived two days after the Aurora,
and both were anchored close together in
Ilasselborough Bay while the transportation
of wireless equipment and stores to the shore
proceeded. The masts, petrol-engine, dynamo
and other wireless paraphernalia were
landed in a rocky cove at the foot and on
the western side of Wireless Hill—the name
afterwards given to the northern headland.
Hurley, through the fortunate accident of
havmg left a valuable photographic lens at
C aroline Cove, went off for a trip to the
other end of the island with Harrisson.
biologist of Wild’s party, and one of the
sealers, who acted as guide.
On the day of our arrival, Mawson, Ains-
worth and Hannam were soon off the ship,
making a detailed reconnaissance and coming
to important decisions which fixed the locus
of the hut and the site of the wireless plant.
Responding to a call from one of the sealers
that there was a man 'on shore who was
suffering from severe toothache, I packed up
the dental instruments and embarked on a
whaleboat taking stores to the beach. De-
spite the surf, we ran the boat well up on
to the sand and leaped out dry-shod. Then I
made my way along the isthmus, crossing
over- at its southern end towards the sealers’
oots. The rough shingle of the upper part
ot the beach and the boggy tussocks were
everywhere covered with the bones, bleached
skeletons and putrid carcases of sea-
elephants which had been killed, stripped of
a portion of their blubber and left to rot
where they lay. The whole of the foreshores
of this narrow neck of land was a ‘charnel
of decay and noisome smells. To escape
from the beach, I took a. path over some
muddy and flattened tussock, to find that
Ninnis was occupying a wide patch, free of
carcases, with his pack of Greenland dogs.
I was directed to the low cabins where
the sealers lived. The docility and trust of
the man with toothache made the extraction
a comparatively easy operation. He was so
overcome with gratitude, after many weeks
of pain, that I was presented with a fine col-
lection of sea-elephants’ teeth —not an un-
fitting reward to one who was, by the way,
more of an anatomist than a* dentist. A ship-
wrecked crew crowded round and told me
of the wreck of the Clyde. I looked through
the comfortless huts and asked many ques-
tions about the boiling-down industry. It
seemed a very drab, grey life, although healthy
enough, this quest for oil on cold and stormy
Macquarie Island.
I wandered off to the beach, passing a sea-
leopard and a few royal penguins evidently
bent on some mysterious errand to North
Head. Penguins never impress one as idle
or casual. I made for the wreck of the
Clyde, lying washed by the incoming
breakers, down the slope of the beach. The
remains of a hne schooner, she had been
badly mutilated in her rough transit across
the reef. I climbed up on deck and over the
battered bulwarks watched, in the near dis-
tance, the dark shape of a sea-elephant
looming through the glassy green of the
mobile water. It would thrust its ugly
snout into a passing comber and then slip
with perfect ease into the ropy kelp be-
tween the rough-hewn rocks. Long tresses
of weed shimmered in the briny wash. Be-
neath the effulgent sun the booming sea, the
curving beach, the grassy hills and the stark
headlands were exquisite.
Near the rocky landing-place Wild, Han-
nam and Bickerton erected a tent in which
they lived for the period of our stay at
Macquarie Island. In ideal surroundings
they were mainly concerned with the prox-
imity of a certain gentoo-penguin rookery,
which supplied their larder with choice
steaks cut from the breast of the bird. Some
of us, happening to pass at meal-time, were
initiated by Wild into this Antarctic mys-
tery, the novel flavor of penguin meat. Cut
in thin slices and fried in butter, it chal-
lenges comparison with chicken or turkey.
The heavy loads came sliding up the "fly-
ing-fox” to the accompaniment of rollicking
airs shouted by the string of men on the
hauling-rope. Blake, the geologist, was the
most versatile songster-. No weight was too
heavy to resist the ardor of "I’ll go no
more a-roving with you, fair maid,” or the
dogged rhythm of “Blow the man down.”
These were his favorite tunes as he bore off,
with a rope’s-end round his shoulder, and
the rest of us fell into line. The two wire-
less masts rose up in topmasts and top-gal-
lants, well stayed .and ready for the aerial
to be hoisted between them. The engine-
liut made rapid progress towards completion.
Then Hurley arrived back from his jour-
ney to Caroline Cove. He had found his
precious lens and had seen and photographed
many wonderful sights. He told of great areas
of the seaward valleys grey with the massed
thousands of penguins. At the southern end
and at the Nuggets were rookeries contain-
ing more than half a million birds. Many
rookeries of giant petrels were seen, the
birds vomiting in their disgusting fashion at
the approach of an intruder. The going
over the knobby tussocks, projecting four
feet in some places, and full of slushy
bogs, was very heavy. After they had
marched up and down the hills for nearly
five days. Hurley’s boots were so dilapidated
that he discarded them and wrapped canvas
round his feet as a covering. lie carried
a heavy camera, the sealer a large albatross
which had been captured, and Harrisson sun-
dry specimens of birds, eggs and plants.
Hurley was further handicapped through
straining a tendon in his leg. Harrisson
deemed it wise to leave his two companions
behind and push ahead, since the party had
arranged not to be absent for more than
four days. As he was nearing North Head,
after passing a miserable night on the tus-
socks, Mertz and Whettcr met him and im-
mediately set off to give their assistance to
the other two men.
By December 21 the whole of the stores
were ashore; and not too soon, for the mirac-
ulous spell of fine weather was over. The
wind came freshly from the north-east, bring-
ing a tumbling sea in its train. On Satur-
day, December 23. the‘gale blew hard, so
the departure was postponed until Sunday,
the 24th. On that morning the wind had
abated slightly. Up on Wireless Hill the
islanders, as they were now entitled to be
called, had their signalling flags flapping on
the masts—“ Goodbye!”
It was a quiet run down to Caroline Cove;
the mountains swathed in mist and fitful
gusts of the north-eastei'ly gale whirring
down the broken gullies. Wooden barrels
were towed ashore to the gravelly strand and
filled from a pool at the foot of the ravine.
Casks of water went floating off to the ship
all the afternoon. A howl of wind would
break rarely into the cove, but Christmas
Eve came in quite calm. The hills enclosed
us, profound and majestic; the penguins
croaking like a fen full of raucous frogs,
and the wild skuas and the graceful sea-
gulls fluttering over the rocky pools. The
weather brightened rapidly. Twelve miles
south of Macquarie Island, under a serene
sky, the Aurora passed the Bishop and
Clerk —dark, jagged islets of changed lava
encircled by foam. The ocean was intensely
blue ; a light north-easter blew behind, and
all sails were set. The albatrosses and pet-
rels came flying towards the ship and
hovered once mox-e in her w 7 ake.
Christmas dinner was made a special
function, held in three relays. Toasts were
drunk, _ therefoi’e, by three symposia who
vied with one another in hilarious enthusi-
asm. That night we entered the magical
world of the South, for a soft, pure radi-
ance against the dusky foil of the south-
western sky glowed and lit up our path ahead
with a pallid light—the aurora australis.

“Yes, Uncle,” an English musical comedy
based on a French play, given its first Aus-
tralian run at Adelaide Royal, has catchy
music, effective dances and a sufficiently
funny plot. But it recalls the ghosts of all
the Parisian farces there ever were. Wil-
liam Greene is an artist, just married, and
out of his purple past he turns up Lolita,
the typical stage Spaniard, with bloodthirsty
father to match. Frith, friend of the family,
is put on to bear the brunt, face the knife
and pistol, and make explanations. The
first act is mostly models and music. The
second is evidently the original French
comedy, .served plain. Husband and wife,
resolved separately to go out for the even-
ing, persuade Frith and an attractive widow
to take their respective places at home.
(The idea is at least as old as Boccaccio.)
Enter to them unexpectedly Field Fisher,
the typical uncle-from-India, taking them
for man and wife, and (of course) asking
pointed questions about the .sleeping-arrange-
ments. And (of course) all hands turn up
at (he ball in the last act. There are (of
course) comic waiters and athletic dances;
and at 10.45 Fisher conveniently asks a
question to which everybody can reply “Yes,
Uncle.” Chorus and curtain accordingly.

as modern as the material is ancient. There
is no sentimental hero. The leading part
might have been made for Frith, who rushes
his trifle of love-making with the widow, but
finds the action of the piece always ready to
wait while lie measures and wraps up
imaginary chiffons or joins in a topical duet.
Also there is no girl, the wife and widow
being the heroines. Cecil Bradley is the
former, and Grace Lavers, now promoted to
the lead, brings all her charm into it, though
hardly equal, vocally, to the task. She has
the big song of the piece, “Widows are Won-
derful.” But the men carry most of the
weight.

“Tails Up” at Sydney Tivoli continues
to be a fine ad. for the versatility of Minnie
Love, who tackles a whole row of light jobs
and does them all well. And there’s the
Spring Ballet, the joint triumph of the revue
girls and the lighting expert.
At the Playhouse (alongside Sydney’s

Sydney Strand is showing Owen Moore as
“Piccadilly Jim,” a young man created by
P. G. Wodehouse to shock th'e-conventions in
general and the pretty girl, represented by
Zena Keeffe, in particular. Jim’s whirl
is comprehensive (it has to be owing to the
thinness of the plot), embracing everything

Yoik’s Chinatown. Haymarket and Globe
concern themselves with the fate of a young
man who has to hold a job for a month to
win an heiress. The story is adapted from

“You’re fired!” Anita Stewart at Crystal
Palace and New Lyceum enters from sten-
ography into “Her Kingdom of Dreams” on

“True Heart Susie.” Susie is a dear little
girl in astonishing head-apparel who sends
the boy she loves to college out of her own
little savings. Then he grows into a minister
and marries a fluffy Bettini. and it is not
till after that bit of thistledown is wafted
over the Great Divide that Susie collects the
overdue interest

the wholesome laugh and put one on better

ston, the mad lodger, chases his brown
brother, Menta Pam, into Tilly’s aspiring
tea-party ; and Constance, the jolly good fairy
ot the piece, persists in putting out a little
white- frock for the adornment of her young
protegee, who is about six inches shorter
and half her weight. Constance, it seems,
carries little white frocks around with her
f°r the use of little white girls who go visit-
ing without a change of wardrobe.

The weeks of “Kissing Time,” at Mel-
Majesty’s, hai r e not yet been num-
bered in public, but it is understood they
will not go on for ever. Meanwhile Ban-
toek’s allusion to Nell Payne’s lack of con-
versation raises the question whether a large
fund of small talk wouldn’t detract from her
arch smile and eloquent dimple. Besides,
the little she says is to the point. When
somebody remarks that Bantoek wants a
shave, Nell rubs her near-side cheek and
says “Oh, he does!’’
"As You Were” has got to Last Nights
at Melbourne Tivoli, and it still looks as
though the two pert chorus girls of Ancient
Athens will have to pay for their own
lunch.
Touching Melbourne Town Hall and its
concerts to come, the Taits have taken time
by the forelock in announcing that the N. S.
Wales State Orchestra will start a Beetho-
ven 1 estival on May 10, and give six
performances in all. Even at the distance
that Collins-street is from Sydney Domain
one can hear this orchestra groaning over
the hard work that tireless Verbrugghen ex-
tracts from it.
H 3- Warner is a Bret Harte hero in
1 lie Grey Wolf’s Ghost” at Melbourne
Majestic this week. The film repeats some
ot the incidents in Ilarte’s “Maruga.” and
gives a capital impression of American pluck
and energy in early California. Warner, as
Harry West in search of his dad, indicates
his feelings in brief vivid gestures that seem
strangely picturesque after the gymnastics
of the average movie star. Corinne Griffith,
who follows Warner, is the only gleam of
sunshine in the dark and morbid “Tower of
Jewels.” At Hoyt’s “The Lost Princess”
shows Albert Ray as an Inky Wayfarer
battling hard with a cruel editor for the best
girl in the play. Albert captures the lady
after a test of his ability that only a mad
movie editor would devise. In “Chasing
Rainbows,” also at Iloyt’s, Gladys Brock-
well has a sentimental journey as the be-
loved of a cafe proprietor. The dilly pair
have to get through a gold rush and two or
three saloon scraps before colliding ecstati-
cally in a terrific happy ending.
Adelaide Tivoli has eclipsed all its previ-
ous records for gate-money with the “Mother
Hubbard ’ pantomime. Cannot and Barry
Lupino are on the stage, one or both, most
of the time, and Hassam’s big dog is a fine
piece of animal work. The Creightons and
Moon and Morris put in good extra turns.
Daisy Yates and Kelso Henderson dance
breezily, and Elsie Parkes leads the ballet.
At the King’s another panto, “Babes in the
Wood,” is played by children, and has its
own public. Stella Gaul and little Eileen
James will be worth watching. At the
Majestic are soldier Joe Teague, one-legged,
two-voiced and immensely popular; Alberto
the conjurer, with excellent patter; the un-
usual contortionist Fishers, and several
pairs, of whom the males are mostly the
better halves.
Said General Byng, replying to the toast
of the Army at the annual dinner of the
English Variety Artists’ Benevolent Fund at
the Savoy a few weeks ago: “In France we
had our Robey trenches and our Little Tich
shells, and two pairs of our most dangerous
observation-posts were named Beattie and
Babs and Lorna and Toots.” Robey and
Tich and Beattie and Babs are old pals.
Lorna and Toots are newer acquaintances
They are, of course, those clever little Aus-
tralians, the Pounds sisters, who only dur-
ing the last year or two have captured Lon-
doners.
“Harrison O.”: Much ingenuity goes to
the making of the thunderstorm which rages
throughout half an act of “Tiger Rose.”
Not only is the customary grinding appa-
ratus of wood and silk used for getting the
wind up, but exceptionally fierce blasts are
produced by an electrical contrivance, a
cross between a grindstone, a fire-extin-
guisher and a pair of bellows; while the
rustling of window-curtains and other
draperies is attended to by four electric
fans. Genuine moisture, visible through the
open door of an interior “set,” patters on
to a canvas spread behind the scenes from
a water-main in the flies and escapes into
a tank below the stage. A small army of
supers i? kept busy beating drums, banging
a sheet of iron, firing rifles into an iron
tank, operating electric torches to represent
lightning, rolling cannon balls down a steep
wooden gangway, and otherwise aiding in
the production of a perfect devil of a storm.
Each super has his “part,” the noise-makers
taking their cues from a number of colored
electric lights which flash on and off accord-
ing to the particular 'Variety of rumpus
required, the stage-manager operating the
switchboard from the prompt entrance.
“CARMEN,” AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Don Jose Ernolle sings his love to Carmen
Leah Myers.
“Dido”: I left lan Hay’s “Tilly of Blooms-
bury” hoping against hope that someone in
authority will declare a close season for
bailiffs who pose as ancient retainers or
members of families temporarily em-
barrassed. In farce, comedy, pantomime,
comic opera, burlesque—where haven’t we
met this dreadful person?
“R. 8.” (S’Africa) : A rumor of the death
of the veteran showman R. T. Tregaski, of
the Steele-Payne Bellringers, seems to have
reached Australia; and Tregaski tells me
that he won’t believe it till it is sworn to.
The Bellringer who can’t deny a similar re-
port is Ralph Steele; he died in Durban
eight months ago, after a lingering illness.
It was feared that he would not live to see
his wife, who was touring the back veld;
but he clung on till the combination was due
in Durban. Then he crossed over. The
Bellringers are still going so strong that it
seems as if the S’Africans have claimed the
show for their own. Dorothy Gardner is
still with them, and a favorite everywhere.
“Dido” : Caruso, the tenor, is the fat hero
of a film drama, “A Splendid Romance.” I
went. Enrico proved to be a tubby man in
a quantity of fine raiment straining at every
point to retain its contents. I have never
seen another who seemed so close upon the
point of bursting out of his clothes with a
loud report. Furthermore, he has a broken
nose, or a very life-like imitation, and at
his best he looks like a man who slices ham
in a cooked-food depot out on holiday. Nor
can he act for the pictures with finer effect
than you might reasonably expect from the
aforesaid person who chops pig into thin
wisps. He is at his worst absolutely when
he tries to be a coy kitten. A large fat
man in tight clothes and a glowing bell-
topper that sits on him like a snail on the
hide of a rhinoceros has no right to attempt
to be a coy kitten with women in public.
It was at this stage that a musical man
three seats from me groaned: “For God’s
sake sing!” He knew' how his hero was
going to the dogs in public estimation, and
what alone could save him.
“Glen II.”: On the stage a “gentleman”
is almost invariably fashioned in the like-
ness of an actor. In “Tilly of Blooms-
bury” there is an elderly scholar who had
been a Fellow at his university until he
took a long alcoholiday. Nothing more
like an actor could be imagined His
white hair is an eloquent tribute to
the wigmaker’s art, and his diction
is the e-10-cutionist’s. In his dulcet
tones one catches an echo of the voice that
breathed o’er Eden; and his manners are
those of a gentleman of that “old school”
from which the old bachelors of a thousand
monologues, who smoke cigars while brood-
ing over their dear, dead sweethearts, have
been recruited. In an unimpeachable club
he would be regarded as slightly eccentric;
as shopwalker in an old-established fluff
emporium he would be worth his weight in
sugar. “Character” actors called upon to
represent sozzled cabmen, old family
retainers, prosperous stockbrokers and
others study their types in their habit as
they live; but when the part of a nice old
gentleman is handed them they take a glance
at their professional acquaintances and pro-
ceed to do their best according to their
footlights.
In the Factor’s House at AVutchi, where the lone
Loon River flows,
Dwelt a kind of cow-girl spinster who was known
as Tiger Rose;
Her dad had been a heretic, and Rose took after
dad :
Religion always turned her sick, or made her very-
mad.
She swore in broken-English, being French-Canadjan
born,
And all the boys adored her, but she laughed the
boys to scorn ;
She had no time for Michael, gentle Pierre, George
or Dan,
.'or she’d fixed her warm affections on a kid she
called her “Man.”
Miss Rose had formed a notion that a woman ought
to wait
Till the instinct of devotion guides her surely
to her mate ;
So. when Norton caught her fancy, in the wilds of
AVutchi AA'um,
Said she, “I'm your fiancee,” and she struck the
johnnie dumb.
Anon she tried to save him from the clutches of
the law:
Oh, gently on his hairless cheek she stroked her
velvet paw,
And clung to him, and fondled him, as only such
girls can—-
lie never had a chance in life, that meek and mild
young man.
When lovely woman grabs him in this domineering
way,
Methinks the object of her love should also have
a say ;
No Tiger Roses have the right to marry whom they
please—
Blokes need protection from their bite, and safe-
guards from their squeeze.
Small wonder Norton seemed so sad, so thoughtful-
like and glum,
So pallid in the morning glad that dawned on
AVutchi Wum !
Between his forced endearments he was thinking,
we suppose,
Of whether Death were better than long life with
Tiger Rose.
‘‘Tiger Rose’’ and the thunderstorm are
now in the third week at Melbourne King’s.

Of the numerous post-war model cars which have
passed under the notice of “The (British) Engineer”
this journal has only considered two of them specially
worthy of mention, and one of these is the “Wolseley”
Post-war Model “Fifteen.”
When it is considered that “The
(British) Engineer” is extremely
careful in dealing with such matters
as this, it is to the credit of the
“Wolseley” that it should be given
such a favorable position.
The “Wolseley” Post War Model
“Fifteen,” although an almost en-
tirely new model, is still presented
with many of the excellent features
of design which contributed to-
wards the fame of the pre-war
“Wolseley” Car.
It differs in certain modifications
only—modifications the value of
which were learned by experience
gained in the construction of fine
mechanism for naval use and aero
engines during the war period. The
weight of the “Wolseley” Fifteen
complete is under 23cwt., and the
engine develops over 40h.p., thus
making the power-weight ratio
nearly equal to 3h.p. to the cwt.
The “Wolseley” Fifteen is a car
that compels confidence. In hill-
climbing ability, in riding comfort,
in speed, durability, flexibility, all-
round beauty and convenience, the
“Fifteen” cannot be excelled.
It produces sufficient power to
conquer the hardest conditions of
travel, whilst always retaining a
sufficient reserve to make it easy
and pleasant to handle even in
emergency.
Wolseley Agents will be pleased
to furnish fullest particulars of
the “Wolseley” Post War Model
“Fifteen” on request.

"Girls, I can't decide whether to take up
singing or elocution.”
“Oh, do take up elocution.”
“Why?”
“We hare heard you sing.”
“8.1. D.”: I went to see Harry Kaigh
Eustace and his adventures in the African
jungle the other day, and I soon wished
there was more jungle and less Eustace.
For one thing, he spent too much time in
assuring us that he could tell us of
some wonderful adventures if he had time.
For another, his puns' are wearying.
When he showed us a picture of a crane he
said that at first he took it for a stork
because it was stalking along, and that
someone pointed out that it must be a crane
because it was craning its neck, on which a
third wdt asked if it would be a fly if it
were flying. Furthermore, overpowering and
interesting as is U.K.’s personality, it was
hard to maintain excitement at a high level
when a picture showed him seasick.
“O. Blin’’: When Snowy Baker and E. J.
Carroll learn a bit more about making movies
they won’t expect people to read in long and
tedious paragraphs what should be explained
by the action. Also they won’t pretend
that an obvious suburban mansion is the
bush home of an English baronet, and they’ll
also ban the cowboy hat and disarm the
population. These remarks are suggested
by the latest Carroll-Baker masterpiece,
“The Shadow of Lightning Ridge,” which
claims Australian patronage on account of
its local production, but is in all its gun-
play and other effects imitation American.
Heaven forbid that this sort of stuff should
go out to the world as dinkum Australian !
“Peter”: For the story of “The Shadow
of Lightning Ridge ’ Snowy Baker caught
a novice, Bernice Vere, who has discovered
the art of facial expression and possesses
the appearance suitable for passionate
females torn by headlong emotions. In
the film Bernice makes her d6but as Portu-
guese Annie, a vixenish, jealous barmaid
whom the young Australian pictures with
the success of a veteran. Bernice is
alleged to be only 18, and looks so true to
the type she portrays that the Taits have
engaged her as understudy to Marie Ilka at
Melbourne King’s.
“Stargazer”: The trouble with “Tilly of
Bloomsbury” is that it is a deliberately pain-
ful play. All its situations hurt. Even
the overworked asthmatical wheeze of the
broker’s man presently becomes as distress-
ing as a bad corn in a tight boot. The
humor of the comedy does not redeem the
sense of sympathetic anguish with which the
spectator watches the writhings of the Wel-
wyn family in the distressing ordeals they
are called upon to face. One even feels a
pang for the essentially vulgar-minded Lady
Mainwaring in her encounters with the
heroine’s awful brother. No amount of
democratic conviction satisfies one that Percy
Welwyn is really in his appointed place any-
where apart from a skittle .club’s smoke
social; and Mrs. Welwyn and Tilly Welwyn,
in their encounters with the Mainwaring
woman, are fit subjects for the ministrations
of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty
to Mammals.
“0.K.”: “Harrison 0.,” whilst snorting
at lan Ilay for creating the rorty-bloke
character of Percy, as presented in “Tilly
of Bloomsbury” at Melbourne Royal, rashly
assumes that the actor's impersonation fulfils
the author’s purpose. To my way of think-
ing the character is buffooned by I’irie Bush ;
and I take it for granted that much of the
exaggeration was introduced by the stage
manager in London or here. I do not
believe, for instance, that lan Hay in-
vented the wildly-farcieal exit of Percy from
the presence of Lady Mainwaring, wherein
his modest young sister and her well-bred
fiancd join the parting guest in singing
“Good-Bye-ee.” I can’t see the author’s
hand in that bit of stale stage-business, for
it is utterly untrue to the character of the
girl and quite unworthy of her intelligent
.voung sweetheart, who is trying to get
Lady M.’s sanction to his engagement. The
real Percy, born of the author’s brain, be-
longs to the order of high-spirited jokers, who
insist on being “the life of the party” wher-
ever they get any encouragement to “carry
on.” Richard Mainwaring speaks of IV
as a lively sort, and his brother-in-law-elect
addresses Richard as Ricardo. There vou
have it.
“Pongo”: Dorothy Helmricli, of Sydney,
has just made successful first appearances
on the concert stage in London and Aber-
deen. She has moved up quickly’. Leaving
Sydney only last July, she has studied with
the famous Charles Henschel, who predicts
a brilliant future for his pupil. Pending the
Promenade concerts in August for which
she has been engaged, she will tour the pro-
vinces under the Epps and Tillet manage-
ment. Not very long ago the quality of her
voice was not suspected ; she was noted only
as accompanist to sister Madge and brother
Dudley, both well-known Sydney vocalists.
W. B. Beatty and Stephen Mavrogordato
developed the vocal power in Sydney, and
Dolores gave her warm encouragement.
“Old Pot” : Noticed in the cast of “Light-
nin ” the name of that celebrated actor,
Mr. Rosier. It has been absent from the
bills for many years, but in the ’eighties
and ’nineties it was a feature. “Mr. Rosier”
was almost invariably used in the pro-
grammes for a “double.” In “Lightnin’ ” he
was Mr. Joseph Rosier. In the old days the
initial “J.” served to identify him. I often
wondered how came the name and the prac-
tice of using it for doubles.
“ Jeune Premier”: I don’t think “Row
A” (B. 25/3/’2O) correctly gauged the
situation when he contended that the play-
goer he heard remarking that Emelie Polini
had “gone off” in “Kindling,” “having seen
that clever woman in several plays, pines for
somebody else with different methods.”
Maggie Moore in the same piece has still the
old. old methods that audiences have ad-
mired for untold years, and is still the old.
old delight. No ! The real reason is to be
found in the jesting comment of the Sundry
Showman (B. l/4/'2O) : “Heroine Emelie
Polini is the worst-dressed actress in Austra-
lia for this production.” Whenever a hero
or heroine has to get into drab duds,
Heaven help them! Fine feathers make fine
mumming-birds with the majority of those in
front, and every mummer knows it.
“Mellish Reef”: For the Prince’s amuse-
ment during his visit to Sydney, a gala per-
formance of the “The Bing Boys on Broad-
way” is to be given. What! Who consented
to such an outrage? Not the Prince. I’ll
swear. What’s wrong with a gala perform-

“On Our Selection.” And if our reputedly
leading theatrical firm hasn’t got that in
stock, let’s tell his Highness so. If I know
anything of the young man he will reply
that the leading Australian theatrical firm
is the firm, whichever it is, that has Austral-
ian stuff in stock.
“Copabella”: That old friend of Press and
Premier, Reuben Kierl, has reappeared, this
time engineering a perfectly legitimate enter-
tainment. There are two in the stunt, Reuben
and another, and their scheme is an Australian
home-life moving-picture allegedly for Bri-
tish consumption, shrewdly entitled “The
Home of the Diggers.” The combine visited
Geelong (Vic.) in Easter week. Under
authority allegedly of a letter from Tate,
five schools were “taken” at work and play,
each seemingly under the impression that
that was the only school to be shown—it
being so “typical of our wonderful secular,
free and compulsory system” ! The children
acted as enthusiastic publicity agents for
several days. Then came from the manage-
ment a notice that scholars in the picture
would be admitted to a showing of the film
for sixpence a head. And fond parents had
to find those sixpences, as well as their own
shillings, to see Billy or Cissy in a flag-
salute or something. The hall was packed
Head teachers were still scratching puzzled
heads when the entrepreneurs folded their
tents and stole silently away to the next
batch of schools.
“M-B.” : “Naming” (and lots more) will
be glad to know that arrangements have
been made for the making of phonographic
records 'in Australia. The necessary
machinery is to cost close on £30,000. An
expert is to be brought from the U.S.A. to
superintend construction. The idea is to
make an Australian record with Australian
artists. Though Melba has contracts with
other cos. the local organisation is to
approach her in the matter. And unquestion-
ably the Sydney Conservatorium Orchestra
will be approached too. Whether the first
records will be satisfactory remains to be
seen. If they’re not—well, to-morrow is a
day, too.

on the Rundle-street frontage works out at

monwealth record for city property.
That frenzied demand, per repeated ads.
in the S. Aus. dailies, for someone to earn
a large fee by sleeping in a graveyard, was,
in a way, genuine. Though it was admit-
tedly done to call attention to a coming
movie which concerned dealings with the
next world, a man did so sleep, and earned
£lO by it. He was C. L. Lawrence, a re-
turned soldier. lie says he found the pro-
ceedings dull, was not disturbed in any way,
and went fast asleep till roused in the morn-
ing by the investigation committee. The
money he has handed to the Boy Scouts’
fund. It is said that there were nearly
3000 applicants for the job.
“M. 8.”: The Melbourne yarn that Theo-
dore Leonard was boxm in Australia is not
true —unless Wimbledon Park-road, London,
is in Australia. It is true that Leonard
was in Australia years ago. He came with
his father and family, visiting a property
his dad owned. But he became a London
star before he returned to this country. I
remember him playing in the “Merry Widow”
along with the gx-eatest of all Merry
Widows, Lily Elsie. That is going back
some years now. lie was an English star
before most of the present lights of musical
comedy knew what a stage was. And still
he is but a young man. Amusing as he is
in “Kissing Time,” that performance by no
means gives the full measure of his versa-
tility. He can sing songs in one of the
dead languages.
“Norbell”: Mention of the re-appearance,
after a number of years, of Meta Pelham
recalls her connection w r itli a bygone false-
alarm, “Honest Hands and Willing Hearts,”
in which John L. Sullivan made himself
ridiculous as the hero. The pug-actor
arrived by the Mariposa in 1891, and opened
at Sydney Majesty's on July 30. The alleged
play was by Duncan B. Harrison, who also
ran as one of the cast. Some of the others:
G. R. Ireland (Harrie’s dad), Charles Hol-
loway and Alice Deorwyn (Beattie Hollo-
way’s parents), Charles Seagrave, Emma
Bronton, Madge Seymour and Meta Pelham.
“0.K.” is annoyed about something:—
How much longer will the guileless public con-
tinue to swallow the gniff prepared by Yankee pub-
licity agents concerning the enormous salaries paid
io stars and the wondrous art required for acting
to the camera ? Nobody doubts that big figures are
paid to unique personalities such as Charlie Chaplin,
or notable beauty-men like Wallace Reid; but the
lady stars, as a. rule, are mere creations of the
management, and their work could be just as well
done by thousands of everyday girls. The guff of
cinematograph journalism assumes that these dumb-
show performers stand on the same level as
actors. An advt. informs you that Cyril This and
Cecil That will play leading parts at the So-and-So
Theatre to-night, thus suggesting that coining on to
the screen and making violent facial expressions of
love, hate or jealousy is quite the same thing as
walking on the stage and putting fine shades of
expression into the voice. Goodness only knows
how much or how little salary is earned by ordinary
stock mummers at the film factories, hut I do know
that any average second-rate actor who had lost
his voice could do the same thing always as well,
and usually better. Why, raw amateurs acting for
the screen are not nearly so ridiculous as raw
amateurs struggling with a spoken play! Famous
artists are renowned for their inflections of voice-
tone, or their “golden drone,” or the magnetism of
their personality, or a languid grace of movement
which cannot be reproduced by a photographer whose
apparatus is a consistent liar where movement is
concerned. It wasn’t a silent, jerky, black-and-white
David Garrick at whom the pit use to rise, nor a
dumb, colorless Ethel Irving who witched modern
Australia with her Lady Frederick. By the way, a
touch of the brogue had something to do with the
convincing nature of Ethel Irving’s fine impersona-
tion. Moving-picture actresses, with their conspicu-

MY CURE FOR GLOOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WTirn grey thoughts like rata come creeping
And I see their bead-eyes peeping :
When blue devils, lightly leaping,
Make a ring around my chair;
When the candle’s burning lower,
And Thought’s mill is turning slower ;
When a retail wild-oat grower
Sees his future in the air,
Then 1 blow a trombone madly, and I beat a Chinese
gong.
Ere I dance upon a housetop and engage in ribald
song
Just to scare away the devils. This is wisdom from
Hong Kong.
If you sit and brood, your liver
Will send thoughts to make you shiver
Till the swiftly-flowing river
Seems to chuckle and say “Gome!’’
So, regardless of all chatter,
The infernal silence shatter!
Get you up and wildly batter
On a splendid, roaring drum!
Caring naught for deafened wowsers who stand off
and glare their hate,
Beat and dance amid the thunder and your blood will
circulate.
And some honest man and drunken will roll up and
call you "Mate.”
Do not work in silence frigid
Till your heart and brain are rigid.
For the love of Mike (and Brigid)
Wake the echoes now and then!
Life can’t be a constant revel.
But it shouldn’t be all level,
And we’re sliding to the devil
If the blues close in again.
Let us have a little laughter just, to keep the day’s
work sweet
And to drown the shuffle-shuffle of the crowd’s insen-
sate feet.
Blow the trombone, O my brother, and the drum of
glory thrash,
And we’ll dance in showers of laughter as the wild
notes clang and crash!

DR. SHELDON’S GIN PILLS
Banish Backache and Kidney Troubles.
PROVE THEIR VALUE FOR YOURSELF.
Every woman ought to know her own value, and how much her health, happiness and general fitness for work or enjoyment matter to those about
her. Mothers are the frame upon which the work of the world is built up, yet how can a woman prove a cheery, helpful wife, a wise, kind mother,
or a sympathetic companion, if she is out of health, over-weary or dispirited? Headaches, backaches, depressed nerves, sleeplessness and kindred
troubles invade and break up more homes than any human foe. You drag through your work too tired to enjoy life, and even too tired to sleep when
night comes.
It is not the outside things, such as money or success, that make life happy, but good health and abundant spirits. You may have drifted so far
down that you think you will never be strong again. But good, sound health is for all. With healthy kidneys once more acting freely, these dis-
tressing symptoms you have endured so long will vanish. Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills are now doing for others what they can as easily do for yon —
make life worth while. Turn over a new leaf for health, and start with Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills to-dav

Many times when I have read what other women think of your Gin
Pills I thought of writing to tell you my opinion of them, which is
that there is nothing in the world like them for women. I have been
a constant user of them for many years, and consider that my present
fine health and strength are due to their beneilcial effects. They clear
the head and the kidneys, and are invaluable for the many ills women
are prone to suffer. I send you my photograph and give vou full per-
mission to make public what I say about Gin Pills. My advice to all
women is to take a Gin Pill now and then—there is nothing so good;
they prove all a woman can look for. This sounds a big thing to say.

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
With a win in each of the three w!f.a.
events, and a second in Sydney Cup, wherein lie
carried 9st. 91b., Poitrel stands right out on his
own. He is perhaps the best horse over a distance
under the weight-tor-age scale that has yet raced in
Australia. It is his freakish ability to run the
last six furlongs of a two-mile race in Newmarket
time, and the concluding mile of 12 furlongs in lion-
caster time, which buried Desert Gold and Gloaming
and made a first-class galloper like Kennaquhair
look like an ordinary handicapper. Yet Kennaquhair
in any other year would be counted among the best
of his time at w.f.a. In the handicaps Poitrel is
handicapped by more than the lead. His size gets
him into all sorts of trouble in a crowd, unlike a
big long-striding horse such as Kennaquhair, or the
defunct Rebus, who was a terrific fighter in a field.
But with a fair run, carrying the weight all the
way, neither of them could make Poitrel do his
best.
They didn’t stand Artilleryman up to Poitrel in
the Cumberland Stakes. Instead, the colt was
started in the All-Aged Stakes, w.f.a., a mile;
whereupon Melbourne reached for its pockets with
both hands, having great confidence that Chrysolaus
had been beaten on his merits in the Doncaster and
that Artilleryman would do it again. So it hap-
pened that he came to nine to four and Chrysolaus
to three to one, with Sir Ibex and Cetigne at
sevens and Molly’s Robe and Eusebius at 100’s to
six. Jimmy Pike was put aboard Chrysolaus, this
time with Bst. 121 b., or 71b. more than the grey
carried in the Doncaster. Artilleryman, with Bst.
81b., was first off the mark. Chrysolaus moved away
slowly and only found his feet when the rest were
nearly four lengths further on. At the six-furlong
pole Molly’s Robe was out alone, with Artilleryman
and Eusebius next, just ahead of Sir Ibex and Chrv-
solaus. The fo.ur were in line a length from the
mare at the top of the straight—and three of them
were in dire trouble. Just as they hit the last fur-
long Pike closed on Molly’s Robe, quickly chopped
her down and struck the line a winner by perhaps
a couple of lengths. The rest had been run off then-
legs, and as they fell to pieces Sir Ibex scrambled
home third from Artilleryman, with old Cetigne
and the rest well astern. Chrysolaus arrived in
“37£” after moving off last. The argument about
the Doncaster ended very abruptly. The winner is
a conspicuously free galloper, with a fine even move-
ment, and is going to be heard of again.
The big Melbourne contingent suffered horribly
over Artilleryman, and King of the Sea was backed
by them for a hatful in the Cup. His Majesty did
them a good turn at a short price in the Dangar
Handicap on the last day, and Seabound came to
light in the City Handicap. But there were heavy
wads for Wedge in a nine furlongs evert. And
Hyades, another of the bunch from beyond the
Murray, rolled home with scarcely a bean aboard.
The slickest of the multitudinous two-year-olds
was Tressady Qu<*m, who, having taken the Gim-
crack Stakes in the Spring, helped herself to the
Champagne Stakes. Glenacre annexed the rich Sires’
Produce Stakes and didn’t have any the worst of
the luck on the trip. In these races Dingle’s brother
Erasmus ran second and third. The Persian Knight
colt Specialty, who appropriated the Easter Stakes,
is the sort that is likely to improve with keeping.
Kilkenny Boy, one of Syce’s progeny, after a couple
of unobtrusive efforts, showed the way home to a
big field over a mile on the last day.
Millieme’s efforts in the Leger and Cup hadn’t im-
proved him for the three miles’ journey of the
Cumberland Stakes. Half a mile from the end he
was bleeding from both nostrils and Walker pulled
him up. It was a fool of a race —as it always is.
Two or three horses invariably canter most of the
way and trot some of it and then have a brush home.
In a well-run stoush stadium they would be ordered
off the convincing-ground to appease the public ire
and contempt. On Saturday Poitrel waited on
Kennaquhair till half-way up the straight, and then
easily settled him. But the exhibition lasted 6}
minutes, and as this was nearly a minute longer
than the time-limit, prize-money was cut down by
half.
* * * *
Matt Cranney, who closed all his volumes
at Randwick the other day, had been toiling with a
book for over 30 years. He was a little wisp of a
man with an eight-cylinder voice. He is said, in
recent years, to have collected over £60,000 for
various charitable and patriotic funds.
If the A.J.C. authorities had deliberately
set out to discourage tote-betting as against traffick-
ing with Ike Shortodds they could ha-rdlv have
done more than they have at Randwick. Tote
patrons from the stands have to fight their way
through the Ring, or journey round it in order to
put their money on the machine. To collect divi-
dends they are required to struggle almost as far
as the western entrance-gates. Why shouldn’t Ike
and his howls be relegated to the outer parts of
the course, and the contrivance which both operates
in silence and is more remunerative to the club
be installed on the present Ring site?
* * * *
“0.K.”: The strongest of all evidence in
favor of Poitrel is given by Ivennaquhair, apart from
the reasonable assumption that the little horse was
unlucky in losing the Sydney Cup with 9st. 91b. up.
In the spring of 1918 Kenetcetera won the Metro-
politan two days after being beaten over the same
course by Poitrel and Desert Gold. Six months
later Poitrel beat Ken. in three w.f.a. events at
Randwick. In the following spring the little horse
added two more defeats of the big fellow to his
total, and at the recent Randwick meeting he
repeated the dose both before and after Ken.’s
victory in the Cup. The only time their positions
were reversed was when he finished nowhere in
Ken.’s Metropolitan. Both of them were well beaten
when lan ’Or won the Sydney Cup last year, which
joint and several downfall now appears to have
been due to the comparatively heavy going. This
year’s Cup race was B}see. faster than last year’s,
and Sjsee. and lljsec. faster than the Cups
credited to Carbine 30 and 31 years ago. Weight
didn’t count as much as when the going is heavy,
and had Artilleryman not been staling off the
places would have been filled, probably, by the three
top-notchers. With Artilleryman, however, there is
still the question as to whether he will ever be a
great weight-carrier. He was a brilliant colt in
the spring, but both at Randwick and Flemington
the son of Comedy King was rivalled or outrivalled
by Richmond Main when their w.f.a. was
Bst. 101 b., whereas at Caulfield and Flem-
ington, when his maximum was Bst. 51b. (in the
Guineas) and his minimum 7st. fill)., Artilleryman
shone his brightest. Three of his easy wins in
the autumn at Melbourne were scored under easy
weights—Bst., Bst. 21b. and Bst. 31b.—whilst his
Beger victory was no test at all, for he had nothing
to beat. It may happen that Artilleryman will
assert himself as a w.f.a. stayer next season, but
he certainly has not done so vet. Nor has he
equalled the three-year-old record of Poseidon, who
scored 11 wins, three seconds and nothing less.
* * * #
There were some unusual features about
the Easter Monday meeting at Oakbank (S.A.), other-
wise Onkaparinga. For the first time this century,
at any rate, there was no contingent from Victoria,
Randwick and Moonee Valley having' proved more
attractive. Also the jumps for the chief event, the
Great Eastern Steeple, have been made less severe.
Thus A. D. McDonald's Devrori. the aged hurdle-racer
and former S.A. Leger and Onkaparinga Cup winner,
was made favorite, though he had not won over
big timber for about a year and still was allotted
12st. 51b. Only five times has 12st. been carried
Successfully in this race. The old over-weighted
chap broke his neck a brush fence, a fairly easy
jump, but downhill. The winner was Miss Rossly'n
(Sir Robert—Dearix), owned by A. J. Lord. The
lady, a hurdle-racer, shaped awkwardly at the big
fences but raced at the others. In the amateur steeple
another horse of McDonald’s was killed, and in all
six riders were badly knocked about; in one case
the injuries proved fatal. Evidently easier, jumps
make for lack of caution. In the' Hills Railway
Stakes jockey Hopwood continued his astonishing
run - 1914 was the only one of the past eight years
when he did not ride the winner. It must be a
record, at any rate, for a £3OO race at a big
meeting.
But the most widely important thing about this
year’s Oakbank was the installation of a totalisator
on the “flat,” which in this case is the hill in the
middle of the course, where the thousands of visiting
motorists mostly are. The official report was that
the new venture was a “staggering” success, and
will want double the accommodation another time.
The money handled jumped from last year’s £31,000
to £37,000 (only £20,000 in 1916 ; previous record,
£32,000 in 1911). It seems certain that the
S.A.J.C. and A.R.C. will have to follow this lead for
the coming Cup meetings. Betting except by tote is
utterly illegal in S.A.; and it is a blow to democracy
to see men arrested every meeting, on one side of
the course, for doing what others do unchecked—
and with Government standing in on the profits—
on the other side.

Ingliston, near Kalian (Vie.), long time
the property of John O. Inglis, and the birthplace Of
Malua, winner of the Melbourne Cup in ’B4, has
been sold to the Ballan Pastoral Co. after remaining
in the hands of the Inglis family for more than
half a century.
*** * .
The Orawia Steeplechase, run lately at
Clifden (M.L.), provided something extra in thrills.
All the horses bar two stopped at the first or second
fence. Cultana fell, but was remounted by a badly
shaken rider who tumbled off on the flat. Another
jock, who had come a cropper, also hopped on his
nag and resumed the race. Frog, the only other
prad still going, cleared the water-jump, but fell
at the next fence. Remounted, he hattled along and
came down again at the last fence. A halt was
called here while the rider replaced a broken bridle.
Then he cantered in a winner by two furlongs.
* * * i
Crusader, with serious opposition absent,
continues on his winning way. The ancient Wee
Gun shook him up a bit in S.A. Tatt.’s Handicap.
The Kooringa horse, however, was giving the young-
ster lllb.
Another horse with a winning way—Two
Blues —took the principal race, the Easter Handicap,
at Mowbray Park (Tas.). The son of True Blue
was giving the second horse, Stitching, 471 b.! Show-
ing how the public estimated the result of the race,
the divs. were only £1 2s. 6d. and a guinea.
At the just-finished Canterbury (M.L.)
J. C. meeting the Great Easter Handicap was thought
to be a certainty for Radial (All Red —Aemia), but
the gelding didn’t get placed. The race was won by
the English Arrowsmith (Chaucer —Sagitta), about
whose staying ability there is much controversy.
The Champagne Stakes at the same meeting was a
contest among the silvertails, and resulted in Gerald
Stead’s Right and Left winning from Wilfred’s
Delight, while Baronet George Clifford’s Winter
Wind was the tertium quid.

Harry Musgrove. manager of Melbourne
Royal, was the first in Australia to score a century
against an English team.
It happened in Ballarat,
which Harry was visiting
as treasurer of a J.C.W.
company playing “T h p
Silver King” and “Im-
pulse,” anu t.*e ardent
cricketer duly regularised
his appearance with the
local eleven by paying in
a year’s subscription to
the Ballarat club. In
those days young Mus-
grove was a smiter for
the famous East Mel-
■bourne Eleven that
annexed the McLean Chal-
lenge Shield from 1882 to
1881 without suffering a
defeat. Fort3 r years have
gone astern, but Hafrrv
hasn’t lost a whit of his
early keenness. When-
ever he can steal an after-
noon from the J.C.W.
cash-box, he scrapes up a
team at the theatre and
goes out to battle with a
party furnished by one of
the other professions. He
always enjoys himself, and
occasionally a big score
against his name shows
that somebody’s bowling
has been butchered to
make his holiday.

The twelfth round of Sydney grade cricket
concluded on Saturday. Wests still lead," but are
challenged by both ’Varsity and Gordon. C. Cum-
berland haven’t much prospect of moving up from
the tail of the hunt. Gordon finished their game
with the premiers—in fact, they finished the pre-
miers. Before “declaring” Dwyer and Diamond
gathered a hundred-odd each. Macartney completely
demoralised Wests; the only batsman to stand up
was Arnott (35 n. 0.). The bowler’s figures were seven
for 30—five clean bowled. Trenerry (6 for 64) and
Winning (3 for 49) were responsible for Padding-
ton’s win over Sydney on the first innings. The
even Balmain batting side, headed by Brown (76),
got the verdict over Waverley on the first innings.
Carter, Levy and Hendry, on having a second knock,
showed what the Boneyarders might have done
previously. They made 242. Glebe gave Middle
Harbor an exciting little go, and won by 83 on
the first innings. M.H. made a bold bid for 184
and an outright win, but the failing light was
against them. In the villagers’ first innings ICelle-
way took nine for 70. Gee, of the Surfites, with
89 and 90, got no support from his clubmates. If
Punch and Smith had failed as miserably as the
rest of North Sydney, ’Varsity would have taken
their four-point win and been out at Randwick in
time for the Steeple. Punch, who is now at the
top of his form, never looked like getting out.
He smacked up 146. Smith glared defiance through
his windows to the tune of 77. Uni. went for the
bowling in their second innings, and had 3 wickets
to spare at the end. -C. Cumberland succumbed to
Petersham for 161, of. which Stan Thomas contri-
buted 51 (n. 0.). Adams, with three for 39, bowled
best for Petersham. In Petersham’s second Strike
Andrews and Steele showed good cricket.

Sam Francis, of a Malvern (Vic.) State
school, has bowled 406 balls since Christmas in the
local schools’ premiership cricket matches. His
tally to date is 55 wickets for 93 runs. If he
can keep his curve during the next few years, Sam
should be able to see a lot of the world by and
bye, with a game like that to pay his way.
**# * *
The season’s club batting averages in
Adelaide cricket are headed by Don Steele (Uni.)
with 95; he batted only six times and was twice
not out. Among the more regular players Loveridge
and Arthur Richardson (East Torrens), L. V. Pellew
(Uni.) and Rundell (Adelaide) range from 56 to
52. Gehrs made most runs, 575 : average, 47. A.
Richardson easily tops the bowling average, with
54 wickets at 13; Bartlett (Adelaide) next, 33 at
under 15. Townsend and Lucas each took over 40 ;
C. E. Pellew and Payne, coming in just at the end
of the season, took a few at trifling cost. These
figures do not bring into account some good men,
Pritchard and Williams of the Port. Andy Smith
and Coombe, of West Torrens. The figures of those
clubs are not yet available.
The cricket match in Adelaide at Easter
between the local Stock Exchange clerks and those
of Melbourne will go down to history as the onlv
one ever won by 11 wickets. Melbourne made 72
and 172, the home team 204 and 42 for none out;
and, as they were playing 12 a side, the apparently
impossible happened.
There have been two cruelty prosecutions
in Sydney lately. In the first a young fireman
named Jensen grabbed a cat belonging to a George-
street bootblack, took it down a side street and
jumped on its head till it died. Jensen’s diversion
cost him £2. Later Herbert Bass was convicted
of hammering a horse with a piece of iron because
it was too weak to drag over a ton of bricks
up a steep incline. He was fined £3. Prosecuting
for cruelty is an invidious job at best. The pri-
vate citizen who interferes risks assault and invites
abuse. If a paltry fine is to be the only outcome
in the most hideous cases, then those who are
trying to protect animals which are helpless to
protect themselves will be tempted to go out of
the business. In both the above cases gaol without
the option would have been none too drastic. The
suppression of brutality is desirable from the point
of view even of those who care nothing for the
sufferings of animals. It is notorious that unchecked
cruelty to animals has a brutalising influence on
the community, which influence finds expression in
assaults on human beings as well as on beasts
Thus the man who looks on idly while a dog is
being maimed, or a cat kicked to death, is ipso
facto making it more likely that the same treat-
ment will one day be handed out to him or his.

Frank Brogan, the left-handed Sydney
lightweight, encountered Chris Jordan, of Melbourne
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. The en-
gagement was willing on both sides, and during
its brief duration both men landed many solid
wallops. Brogan took one on the point of the
jaw in the fifth round which left him momentarily
helpless. Jordan failed to exterminate his totter-
ing enemy, and it was the last real chance he got
to do so. By the eighth round the Victorian was
practically “out” on his legs. He was felled twice,
struggled to his feet, and was being systematic-allv
battered into unconsciousness when the referee gave
it to Brogan. A poor house witnessed one of the
most willing affairs of the season.
In a few days Gerald Patterson leaves
for England, ostensibly on business, but probably
most on account of the tennis tournaments at
Wimbledon, where he hopes to maintain his grip
on the World’s Championship Singles which he won
last year. He will have to cut down much tougher
opposition this trip. Apart from the English group,
including the formidable Kingseote, a bigger entry
of European stars is expected, and probably the
first line-up since the war of American cracks. If
Patterson beats all-comers he will be a champion
indeed.
The inter-University tennis match for the
Niall Cup resulted in a win for Melbourne last
week by the narrow margin of one rubber over
Sydney after a battle aggregating 476 games. Mel-
bourne Uni., who had previously defeated the Adel-
aide lads by 11 rubbers to 6, found the Sydney
opposition strongest in the singles, and on the
last day lost four games out of six. This brought
the two teams level and left the final decision to
the three battles in the doubles. Fitts and Melnnes
(Melbourne), and Watt and Quinn (Sydney) won
their arguments in two straight sets, but Halliday
and Todd (Sydney) extended Fairley and Cowles
(Melbourne) to three sets (6-3, 2-6, 3-6).
* * * *
O’Hara Wood and llod Heath made a very
good showing against Brookes and Patterson in a'n
exhibition match at Bendigo on Saturday. Heath,
only just home from England, hasn’t yet his old
accuracy and fire, nevertheless he and Wood cap-
tured. the second and third sets at 6—4 in each
encounter, after collapsing in the first without get-
ting a game. With one set to the had, the cham-
pions’ reputation seemed in danger, but shooting
with greater care they got home safely, their
majority reading 6 —3, 6—2. On the result
Brookes and Patterson are below form or are waning
as doubles specialists. Anyhow, thev may not prove
our greatest pair for the next Davis Cup. O’Hara
Wood and Thomas are the likeliest candidates.
Keith Kirkland’s 57 4-sttec. for the Spit
Club’s 100yds. senior championship on Saturday was
the best effort of the season over this distance.
Another fine splash was Syd Beck's 58 l-ssec. in
the Sydney amateurs’ championship. Jack Rvan
took 62sec. to win the League event.
* * * *
Last week’s swimming test at Sydney, over
220yds., to decide who will go with Beaurepuire and
Stedman to the Olympic Games, went to Herald (2min.
32 3-ssec»), Hay (2min. 32 4-ssec.) and Kirkland
(2min. 33sec.). Cotton, Syd Beck (N.S.W.) and
F. Springfield (Q.) also started. A.A.A. athletes
already selected are W. W. Hunt (sprints) and G.
K. Parker (walks), of N. S. Wales, and T. Hewitt
(distance and Marathon), of Vic. Gerald Halpin
(N.S.W.) is the cycling rep.
Ilans Ohrt (America) won the heats and
semi-finals of the half-mile International Champion-
ship in dashing style, and in the final he outclassed
the brilliant Alf Grenda in lmin. 16 4-ssec. Ohrt was
also first past the judge (from scratch) in the one-
mile handicap (2min. 9sec.). In the five-mile
scratch Grenda and C. Walker dead-heated in llmin.
1-ec. Which was the wind-up of the Sydney cycling
carnivals.
* * * *
At Sale (Vic.) 27 motor-cyclists turned
out in the “Australian 200” (which proved on
measurement to be 225 miles), and C. Disney (7-h.p.
Indian), with 28min. handicap, won from R. Finlay
(34-h.p. Excelsior) on 40min. Disney’s time was
3hr. 34min. 59sec. Scratch-man H. Parsons (7-h.p.
Indian) did the fastest lap (20min., an average of
70 m.p.h.). All the placed riders wore Dunlop
“Railroad” tyres.
* * * *
The M.C.C. of Victoria staged a 100-mile
event at Mortlake, which A. J. Parker (7-h.p. Excel-
sior), on 14min., won from W. J. Ousley (7-h.p.
Indian), scratch, in lhr. 57min. 4sec. The latter’s
time was the better by llmin. 32see.
In N. S. Wales the 100-mile whiz w»s
decided at Narellan, and Tommy Benstead won in
lhr. 48minv 24sec. The 20-mile championship was
taken by Mostyn in 22min. 13 2-ssec.
Bananaland took the inter-State bowls
rubber at Sydney last week, overthrowing N. S.
Wales in three straight matches by 94 —86, 99—87
and 111—90. N. S. Wales defeated Vic. by 101—67
and 93—91 ; but Victoria then pulled itself together
and thrashed the Ma State by 112—71.
Billy McDevitt (Tas.) recently defeated
Jack Casey in a match; and last week (with ssec.)
he won the handicap at the Maclean regatta from
Jim Paddon (scratch). His next paddle will be
against Syd Kemp on May 8, and success in that
event may lead to the challenging of Paddon for the
Australian title.
THE VETERAN’S VIEWPOINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There is still hope that additional efforts will
be made to get Jackson to come with the next Eng-
lish Test XI. From an Australian point of view
the absence of Jackson and Fry would be more
than regretted.” —Frank Iredale in Sydney Sun.
Oh, for some of the Old Brigade
Who shone when we were boys—
Lads like Jackson and C. B. Fry:
It puzzles and annoys
To see them shelved. It was not so
Twenty or thirty years ago.
Stoddart is dead and Briggs and Peel
And Alfred Lyttleton ;
Ranji is now a Jam and fat;
But Woods still carries on.
Does Somerset no longer know
What Woods was twenty years ago?
Are they forgotten—Jessop’s swipes,
And Warner’s stolid skill ?
And Mold, whose balls each batsman’s heart
With horror used to fill?
And Steel, who hit them high and low
Twenty or thirty years ago?
Dig out the agf'd from their lairs—
Those who like lightning bowled,
And who were scintillating bats
In the brave days of old ;
And thus once more may England show
The form of twenty years ago.

A tennis tournament and the Barwon
Heads golf frenzy brought sporty people
from all over Victoria to Geelong at Easter.
The Barunah Plains Russells were in full
force, and the visiting Austins stayed with
the Geelong branch. Nora Cunningham
(who will soon be an Austin) and Dorothy
Schlesinger were there also. Lieut.-
Governor Irvine’s son dumped his tennis
racquets at the McKewans’. Mrs. Wheatley
had a house party at dad Fairbairn’s home,
Wooloomanala. Joan of the Fred Fairbairns’
household went down to help her. The Ham-
ilton Laidlaws got a shakedown at the Hursts’
home, Mrs. Jack Morrison, of Woolbrook,
had racquets, golf clubs and guests in every
corner of her home, and the Percy Feather-
stonhaughs made up beds in the billiard-room.
The Percy Douglases had a family party,
with daughter Mrs. Dowling, from Sydney.
The Aitkens, from Berrigan (N.S.W.), and
the McGiJlicuddys, from far Bananaland,
were in the turmoil. Enid Dodd, Ailsa Smith
and Peg Hickey were among the flapper divi-
sion from Melbourne. Captain Sewell and
Major Morris took down their golf sticks.
Captain Wertheim and his bride round shel-
ter in one of the hotels for the tennis events.
Gerald Buekland and daughter Helen and
the Orrne Riggalls were in the crowd. Din-
ner parties and dances or a casual jazz after
dinner filled in every evening of the week.
The big Tenuis Ball of Easter Monday was
a gorgeous affair that lasted until 4 a.m. on
Tuesday. The Frank Austins gave a dance
at Avalon, Lara, on Easter Saturday, and
a fleet of motors carried the guests out from
Geelong. There were private dance parties
at the local Palais. Gladys Watson had the
McKewans’ home for her dance and the
two FeatherstOnhaugh flappers were hostesses
at a jazz.
Mrs. President Bostock and Mrs. J. H.
Thornton, of Caiuperdown, gave a big tea-
party at the club house during the tourna-
ment of the Barwon Heads golfers. The
Manns and the Guthries from Colac were
there, also the Winters from Camperdown
and Miss Newman from Adelaide. The Best
knight was at the party with his two young
daughters and Mr. and Mrs. David Clarke.
A small mob of school-girls helped with the
tea and muffins.
The best bedroom at the Stewart Black
homestead, Glenormiston, is to be occupied
for a night by the Prince during his tour of
the Western District. Black is lord of
ihany acres and has been quite popular for
the past few week;.
It is rumoi’ed that Melba will be in Aus-
tralia during the Prince’s visit. The Melba
relations have no news about the homeward
flight, but Coombe Cottage is being fur-
bished up and altered, which makes the
neighbors think Melba may soon be home.
During the family’s absence a billiard-room
is being built, as well as a whole wing for
grand-daughter Pam.
Eighty matrons, headed by the dames of
Generals White and Chauvel, are hostessing
a Matrons’ dance in the St. Kilda Town
Hall for the Prince. The date has yet to
be fixed. The heartburnings endured by un-
invited matrons are horrible to witness.
The widow of the late Mars Buckley, for-
merly head of the Bourke-street chiffonery,
has just passed out in London at 97. After
the death of the head of the firm about 15
years ago the widow with her only daughter
and three younger sons settled across seas.
Only the elder son, Gerald, spends his income
in his own country. Mrs. Buckley was a
generous, genial little woman with social
aspirations which were fully realised. She
managed to storm the Toorak citadel and
gave gorgeous frivols in the Toorak mansion
now owned by the Scobie Mackinnons.
Gaud Mayor Aikman is getting ready to
send out a ton or so of cards for a bumper
function in honor of Edward of Wales. It
threatens to eclipse every other effort, and
not improbably the threat will be fulfilled.
Unofficially it is announced that Edward
Wales will be host at a ball aboard the
Renown. Already there is great pulling of
wires.
A sassiety note in a London paper sug-
gests that ex-Governor Stanley and his lady-
are homeless. “They are coming to town,”
says the note, “as soon as they succeed in
getting a house.”
Carey and Gilruth were know-n in Darwin
amongst movie lovers as “Mutt and Jeff.”
Carey is the short, squat, shiny-faced little
Mutt who had to look high to .see his chief,
Jeff Gilruth, the big, dark, menacing partner
of the screen comedies.
Captain Charlie Lempriere, who has passed
through the exit door, was a brother-in-lav\
of Melba. He had much to do with adminis-
tering the War Precautions Regulations,
and probably died from an overdose of red
tape.
Edmund Jowett has made an early start
to scatter the Parliamentary salary he
doesn’t want. He wrote a cheque for £2oU
the other dav and passed it on to the bun-
day School Union of Victoria to be spent
amongst the schools of the Grampians elec-
torate. It almost looks as if one member ot
the Country party, at any rate, doesn t ex-
pect the present House of Reps, to die of old
age.
The naval men are opening the eyes of
Australian jazzers to the London habit of
choosing a partner and jazzing with her
practically all the evening. That explains
the cable which reported that at Panama
the Prince picked out a partner and danced
with hardly anybody’ else. Hobart took veiy
unkindly to the innovation. “Nobody was
introduced,” wailed conservative girls at
the Naval Ball. “Some of us had to stand
round like so many plaster saints and watch
proceedings.”
Some of the naicest wool heiresses have
been setting their caps at Ross Smith, his
fame and title, but the young man has been
flying all over the place with a dear little
mouse of a girl who never gets “among those
present.”
“The Revel of Pan,” due next Friday at
St. Kilda Town Hill, is to cause a sensa-
tion. “Invitations” cost a guinea, and
there is no dancing space left. The affair
is to be severely masked and dominoed.
“Count” O’Loghlin, of Tara Hall, Studley
Park, who holds his title from the' Pope,
has gone to Europe with his family for a
year or two; and when things look less
troubled in the Ould Sod he will drop in
there. Out of his fortune he built a cathe-
dral in a South of Ireland diocese a few
years ago.
Mrs. Whithara, the motherly body who
is now taking so much interest in the new
Housewives’ Federation, used to be a Labor
organiser with Senate aspirations. When
the Nationalist fusion happened, Mrs.
Whitham stepped over the line and did her
bit for that party among the womenfolk; but
even to-day the edge of the Red Flag some-
times flutters out. She can speak beauti-
fully.
The Mauglmn clan, headed by the Sena-
tor who suffered for Ryan’s record in
Queensland, is now settled in Sydney. Be-
fore her departure daughter Edna was enter-
tained by her brother- and sister-toilers at
the office of the Commonwealth line of
steamers. Manager Eva handed over the
toilet-set which the staff bought for her.
Burswood, the old and pretentious blue-
stone dwelling at Portland built by the late
Edward Henty, has gone into the hands
of the Baillieu family. Burswood has not
changed hands often. The late James Trang-
mar had it for many years after Henty went
hence; and James Long, a retired biscuit-
maker, owned it after Trangmar. Henty
had three establishments going at the time
of his death —Burswood, Muntham station
and Offington, the last an elephantine home
on St. Kilda-road, long since flatted. The
childless old man died intestate, so that
each of his 70-odd surviving relatives got
something out of his quarter-million.

On May 10, at the St. Kilda Town Hall,
Mesdames Ainslie Mills, Thomas Millear,
Alec Nicolson, S. F. Mann (she was an
Affleck), Atkinson Wood and Rupert
Greene are hostessing a jazz debut for their
respective daughters, Avho are all 18 or there-
abouts. The early budding serves two pur-
poses : it will save the damsels the hideous
elderly-flapper period, and enable them to
dance with the Prince if the chance offers.
Major Drought, son of the departed canon,
has a new job as master at Geelong Gram-
mar School.
An Australian doctor, W. J. Adey, has
just been appointed to a picked job in Lon-
don. He is one of the leading physicians in
the Great Northern Central Hospital.
Melbourne is dancing mad. The next
spasm is a Jazzola Ball, in the St. Kilda
Town Hall, on April 28, with the Hyamses
as organisers.
The Walter Berrys have a Canadian niece,
Lois Poison, whom they are trotting about
to Melbourne gaieties. The young person is
causing a sensation with her frocks. A
house party at cousin Learmonth’s, in the
Western District, served to put a few dinner
and dance “creations” on view.
Ex-Gaud Mayor Cabena last week en-
livened the tedium of his unofficial days by
giving a lunch at Menzies’ to Beatrice Henty,
of the Australian Comforts Fund. The
Drake-Brockmans, of W.A., were among the
guests.
A branch of the P.L.C. has been estab-
lished at Berwick, a country centre of the
Naicest, about 40 miles from Melbourne. The
College bought the Jack Pearsons' house,
and already' has a dozen or two school-girls
in residence, though the official opening isn t
due till April 24.
Prof. Laver, of Ormond College, and his
lady are having a bush party at Warran-
dyte on Saturday, April 24. Seats may be
reserved in cars leaving St. Paul’s at 10.
In pursuit of material for his book on the
work of the Fifth Division Captain H.
Ellis travelled through over 80,000 pages of
war diaries stacked at the British and Aus-
tralian records offices in London. It was a
tremendous job
demanding the
energy of a beaver,
and now that the
great unwieldy book
is out one who d ; dn’t
belong to the Fifth
can only wonder
whether it was
worth while. But as
a sort of family his-
tory the Division
will treasure it.
Ellis himself was
four years abroad,
his principal post
being Divisional
Bombing Officer.
Before the trouble
started he was on
the wfly to a Law
degree, and is now completing the journey
at Melbourne Uni. His wife was Miss I).
Kirkcaldie, a daughter of a Ma State Rail-
way Commissioner and a well-known Syd-
ney soprano, whose fine voice was licked
into shape by Fritz Hart and Melba at
the East Melbourne Conservatorium.
Canon Alfred Wheeler, the nearest
approach to a beauty-actor possessed by the
Anglican Church hereabouts since the pic-
turesque Canon Nash took to saving souls
of another denomination, has had to go into
St. Ives’ to submit to the surgeon’s knife.
Adelaide from a grandstand seat: —
Easter brought perfect weather and a record Oak-
hank. A shower or two had laid the worst of the
dust, but the roads were awful, and the unwary who
motored without a shroud were drab for the day.
Acting-Excellency Murray, who isn’t a racing man.
arrived in time for the first race and lunched with
the committee. Dressing was mostly sane and
tailored, but there were a few frock freaks and
marvellously be-plumed hats. The noi> racing
crowd (25,000 of them) went to the Peace Exhibi-
tion, where the admission turnstiles have clicked
more than 100,000 times to date. We're really
getting a populous village.
Ross Smith made a before-breakfast start, and the
drone of his big machine called Suburbia out of
bed. He flew to Glenelg and Brighton, via Bedford
Park, where his old comrades-in-arms who are
stricken with consumption waved him a good-bye,
and then circled over the Waite home at Mitcham
to the hills and Oakbank, where the early birds
were already streaming on to the course. Thence
on to Melbourne.
An appendicitis operation has upset. Carlien Jurs’s
plans for a Melbourne engagement with the Taits and
early departure to America. She is making good
progress, but her doctor vetoes any work for six
months.
The Weigalls’ A.D.C. is to be Captain Nigel
Somerset, one of the Beaufort clan. The Beaufort
chaplain at Badminton is the Rev. 11. Tower, who
married one of the S. Australian Hawkers. Mrs.
Harmer, wife of our one-time bishop, is another of
the family.
Died at North Adelaide, Mrs. R. Beresford, whose
husband passed on not long ago. Her two sons
did good sen ice with the A.1.F., and one of them,
C. 8., is a fluent Bulletin versifier. She was one of
the Aeramans, well known in the pastoral and busi-
ness world 20. years ago. A. E. Mayfield, whose
wife has ruled the women’s branch of the Liberal
Union for many years, has also had a funeral.
From England comes news that Lionel Tennyson,
whom we remembered as an attractive small boy
in sailor suits during the Tennyson regime at Gov-
ernment House, has given up the army for business.
The war took heavy toll of the Tennyson family.
Harold, the youngest, was torpedoed in the Yiking
and drowned, Aubrey was killed in France, and Lady
Tennyson died of pneumonia added to overstrain
from war work and grief at her youngest bov’s
death.
A knighthood has come to Professor Bragg. He
was prof, of mathematics and physics at our Uni.
for 22 years, married a South Aus. girl, a daughter
of the late Charles Todd, and his two sons were bom
and partly educated here. There was some confusion
among the dailies as to whether father or son had got
the brand, but it seems fairly certain that it is the
father—already a C.B.E.
There is a movement to erect a memorial to
the late- Mrs. Carleton, author of that “Song of
Australia” which has been sung regularly in S.
Aus. schools for half a century. She died at Wal-
laroo in 1874, and her grave is very dilapidated.
The A.N.A. has the little matter in hand.
Several matrimonial engagements were
toasted during the Easter carnival at Gee-
long. Rgth Mitchell, daughter of the Doon-
side Mitchells and a niece of Melba, showed
off her new solitaire. Captain Rowland
Walker, of Sydney, just returned from the
wars, is her young man. All the Mitchells
went down to Geelong to watch cousin
Gerald Patterson play tennis. Gerald’s father
and his two younger brothers were also in
the tournament, so there was plenty of
excitement for the clan. Another engage-
ment announced was that of Dorothy,
daughter of Dr. Newman, of Geelong, to
Cecil Harvey, of Ballarat. The young man
was staying with the Newmans for the
festivities.
With the assistance of Dr. Sugden and a
gold circlet, widower Pitchett, principal of
the Methodist Ladies’ College, linked his
lot with the widow Edith Williams the
other day. The mature parties to the con-
tract and a few friends dropped in quietly
to the Queen’s College chapel, and the knot
was tied. It is not given to many women
to have two top-notchers of Wesleyan par-
sons for husbands. Mrs. Fitehett’s pre-
vious partner was William Williams, D.D.
Hilary Maekinnon, the Donald Mackin-
nons’ eldest girl, will be made one with a
Macedon Reid on April 28. On April 30,
Charlie Kelly and Gwen Affleck will face the
parson at the Afflecks’ Western District
acreage, Minjah.
Mrs. Gordon Chirnside, who used to be
Mavis Thiel, has provided her captain wiui
an heiress to the Carranballac acres.
There is more than a bare chance of a
Victorian State-subsidised orchestra. Pre-
mier Lawson gave a most encouraging
reply to Gaud Mayor Aikman, the
knightly Barrett, Speaker Mackey, Mrs.
Prof. Scott and other music-worshippers
who asked him to guarantee up to £4OOO
a year. He wants all the cards laid
on the table, including the trump. The lat-
ter is the £4OOO in the Lady Northcote
Orchestra Fund. N. S. Wales built better
than it knew when it sent over its orchestra
to Melbourne a few months ago. When a
previous member for Castlemaine, J. B.
Patterson, was Premier, he proposed to
have brass bands about the city to “cheer up
the people.” That was the time banks were
smashing and a moratorium was proclaimed.
Since then Castlemaine has supplied the
University with an Ormond Professor of
Music (Laver). Its present Parliamentary
representative is plainly anxious to go
several better than even J.B.
Pianist Nora Delaney goes on tour of
South Aus. early next month, motoring
between concerts round the Mount Gamhier
district.
Nelson Illingworth, the Sydney sculptor,
was in Melbourne last week to talk about
a bust, if not a life-size statue, of the late
Alfred Deakin, to the order of the Govern-
ment. Illingworth’s statue of the late
Chester Manifold, with which the Camper-
down community will loyally perpetuate the
memory of that much-respected landowner,
is to be ready for the pedestal in about nine
months’ time.
Melbourne Shakspeare Society is joining
forces with the Mermaid Play Society in a
production of “The Winter’s Tale,” and per-
haps the allies are wise in arranging to stage
their old friend the Bard at Melba Hall, in
the University district. Date fixed is the
23rd. The very best highbrows have made
a note of it.
Uni. students are helping the Women’s
College with a carnival in the Uni. grounds
on May 1.
The Lyceum Club is giving a party to the
Streetons this week. Singer Ivy Phillips
will also be a guest and will take part in
the musical programme. Ivy goes abroad
next month for study.
From the end of this month the institute
for Billjacks and Billjims on the Flinders-
street side of St. Paul’s Cathedral and the
lounge on the Swanston-street frontage are
to be closed, the buildings having just about
exhausted their usefulness. In Melbourne’s
annals, through the long hereafter, the
generosity of the folk who maintained the
institute and lounge, and thus made life
more bearable for "war recruits and war-
scarred veterans, will be engraven.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
David
Jones
Cataloger.
Government House has had its last coat
of paint and its final high lights put on for
the Prince’s visit. Several new pictures
look down from the walls. To make the
Prince feel at home Ma und Pa have been
transferred from Parliament House; and
the Art Gallery has lent portraits of Hamp-
den and Beauchamp, former tenants of the
premises; and fine old viking Rawson, who
had lain by for two years since Florence
Rodway painted him from a photo, now
beams from a wall of the main entrance.
Sydney’s new little Mayoress gave her
first cheerio to Sydney the other day. and
had quite a big social fish on her line.
Beside her small biscuit-colored self was the
Birdwood lady, looking like a pastel, from
the hesitant-colored hit of ostrich in her hat
to the hem of her thickly-embroidered shim-
mer of frock. And back of both stood Miss
Henderson, from Government House, acting
as a sort of combined Finger Post and
Guardian Angel. Among those who
struggled for foothold in the rose-banked
reception-rooms was the Hordern fam-
ily in almost all its ramifications. Mrs.
Sam Hordern looked very handsome in
black satin and a black-feathered cloak.
Another visitor whose dressing claimed the
eye was Mrs. Auber .Tones (daughter of the
very-late Judge Callaghan), who wore the
frills, the sweeping train, the beautiful lace
and handsome brooches of the mid-Victorian
era. Mrs. Philip Morton paid her respects
in a soft black dress that carried a large
yellow flower at its waist; the Trades Hall
was represented by Mrs. Dwyer and Miss
Goldie; Miss Rose Scott was there, with
Mrs. Rolin and Mrs. Rich (the conjunction
recalls a nearly 30-years-old law treatise by
Rolin and,Rich); pretty Mrs. Covie; Miss
Bonser in grey cr6pe de Chine; Rabbi
Cohen’s lady ; Mrs. Bruehe ; the Wade, Cook
and Hughes ladies, and Mrs. Sep Bevy with
an osprey in her hat helped to eat the civic
ices. Assistant Town Clerk Layton purred
a benediction over all. while the affable little
new Mayor beamed all round the compass.
Those who arrived, at the tick of 3.15 on
the day of the Birdwood reception had all
the luck of it, for the misguided female who
was 10 minutes late found a string of motor-
cars and cabs snaking from Macquarie-
street right up the avenue, with a queue of
pedestrians that began at the point where
a worried young soldier insisted with ex-
treme affability on collecting the entrance
tickets, and ended beyond the vice-regal
doormat. The late-comer meekly added her-
self to this long human caterpillar, and one
woman reports joining at 3.30 and shaking
the hand of welcome at ten past four.
Biretta and shovel hat, khaki and the
white duck of the Navy, Laborite and
Nationalist, Order and Art (no, not Litera-
ture —Literature hasn’t quite reached Gov-
ernment House yet), Law and Medicine—
these and Lard were mixed by Dame Mar-
garet’s hands into a monster pudding and
served in quick-counter-lunch fashion to the
Birdwood couple. And surely no tunneller
felt greater arm and hand ache after a heavy
day than did Digger Birdwood at set of sun.
After your name had been intoned with
just the inflection that your station called
for, you received your handshake accom-
panied by a genuine smile from Sir Walter,
and a quick, searching look from the General
—a look that made you feel glad you weren’t
on the crimes-sheet. Dame Margaret, out of
mourning, did her handshaking in a mole-
colored satin, and twined a purple feather
in her hat of the same shade. Birdwood’s
little lady smiled greetings from, an atmo-
sphere of older civilisation, her cream georg-
ette dress boasting embroideries of Greek
keys.
The blue-eyed witch that lives in Sydney’s
big waterhole had gemmed the skirts of the
Government House lawns with sapphires;
and woman swathed herself in gladness and
guinea frocks to greet the afternoon. Lady
Helen again gave a boost to the Papal
color by wearing it in her frock, arriving-
in time for tea with Sir Ronald and Justice
Pope Cooper. Every she whose husband
wears a title was there; Army and Navy
brought its wife : Mrs. David Hay, in a won-
derful black and white cape and a white
feathered bonnet, walked among her daugh-
ters, of Whom Mrs. Philip Morton, in a black
lace dress and a furlong of white kid gloves,
tapped the sward with a walking-cane. Mrs.
Jopp was there with daughter Dora, who
wore a wide satin sa&h about her sand-
eolored knife-pleated georgette; all the Con-
suls, correctly hatted and gloved ; the F. G.
Waleys, she wearing diamond earrings and
a black panne velvet with smart white
braidings; Mrs. Toohey, very handsome, held
her little court; Miss Egan, in navy tailor-
ings, gave her decoration an airing; Mrs.
Snepheard Laidley was in flowered taffeta ;
the Thomas Hughes lady and Mrs. Spencer
Brunton, Eadith Walker, the Innes Noad
family, Rolins and Brings, Onslows, Kuoxes,
Gladys Owen and Mrs. Pickburn; the
Papal delegate depreciating the dignity of
his wonderful violet cloak by a tall black
silk hat—these were among the hundreds
who strove for foothold on the green.
The preparations for the Bush Book Club
Ball, after making a good start, apparently
collapsed along the track, for the results at
Sydney Town Hall the other night showed
neither originality nor any great knowledge
of the inheritance the masters of romance
have left us. Never a Dickens nor a Thack-
eray set lived again, and Will Shakspeare’s
women and men were left to languish on the
shelf. But the Bush Bookers displayed an
intimacy with Oscar Asche, and reproduced
his “Kismet.”
That is the trend of the fancy-dress dance
in Australia —to copy a successful theatrical
production. Half the sets the other night
have been the successful play of their day.
Thus we had “Kismet,” “Beaucaire,” “But-
terfly,” “The Gondoliers,” “Trilby” and
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” And then there were
the dear little nursery rhymes to draw upon,
and Grimm and Hans Andersen. Dumas,
Victor Hugo and Balzac, Tom Moore and
Byron had evidently not been introduced, and
as for Australian writers—tush, they are not
on the G.-G.’s visiting list! Only one little
colleen upheld the honor of the green sod,
though it: was plainly a packed orchestra that
greeted the* vice-regal party with a selection
of Irish airs. Lady Davidson wore a rich
white brocaded crepe de Chine, the upper
portions thickly embroidered in pearl and
overlaid with orders. Lady Helen, who also
wore all her orders, came in a dress of ivory
satin and lace and a diamond coronet; and
Lady Birdwood wore saxe blue with touches
of silver. Commodore Dumaresq and Miss
Henderson were with the personages.
The decorations were mainly strings and
strings of paper, representing the pages of
books, stretching from side to side of the
hall, and clusters of golden fruit growing
for no very evident reason on the black
drapery that clothed the railing of the bal-
cony. Every now and again miniature
Beachy Bill fireworks exploded on the stage,
and for the rest the floor was crowded with
dancers, for the most part in ordinary even-
ing clothes, but many in any old fancy cos-
tume, from Pierrots to fairies.
Janet Knox’s “Hiawatha” set was given
the first prize, and Phyllis Rolin’s “Pride
and Prejudice” the second. The latter set
was quite delightful with its young and old
bucks and its sprigged muslin misses. It
had also the joy of netting a prize for the
best-carried-out male character. This went
to the handsome young Mr. Bingley of the
set In his fawn cloth with its beaver
collar, his ruffle and his mutton-chop whis-
kers, he might have stood for Dickens’s
Steerforth. Barbara Laidley, who took the
prize for the best-carried-ouV girl part, was
Lady Mary Carlisle of the Monsieur Beau-
caire set; but Mrs. Tom Watson's “Lady
from the Court of Queen Elizabeth” took the
eye for sheer handsomeness. Gladys Marks,
sombrely impressive, wore upon her pow-
dered hair a hat that resembled the well-
conducted funeral of other days; the little
moonbeam Chinese lady to whom The Bul-
letin gave loud applause at the Dazzle
Ball, was there again, looking more alluring
than ever; Miss Windeyer brought a Ral-
ston niece powdered and patched and wear-
ing old-rose brocade and old-rose point lace;
Mrs. Walter Brunton was in Autumn
browns; and Mrs. Tony Hordern in a dress
entirely composed of ostrich-feather frills.
Mrs. Ernest Watt danced in red shoes like
the prideful girl in Hans Andersen ; newly-
returned Mrs. Vaughan Lewis brought a
dress all blue and silver; and Barbara Knox,
who- saw the golden harvest of her untiring
sowing, wore with great effect the ringlets
and the flounces of Ethel Newcombe. Sec-
retary of the club Beulah Bolton wore
ivory crgpe de Chine, and Mrs. Henry Hill
Osborne came in all her beauty, and one
sighed with regret to think of the soul-
satisfying Ophelia she might have made.
The Matrons’ Ball last year was such a
violent success that last week saw the series
continued at the Paddington Town Hall.
Sydney’s one-time favorite dancing ground
was a bower of yellow and gold. Blossoms
in every grown shade of the forsaken color
flaunted or drooped from chandeliers swathed
in gold tulle. The frocks were something to
stun the ordinary beholder, and the money
represented by the miles of gold and silver
brocade, chiffon velvet and gold and metal
embroideries would have given every kiddie
in Sydney an Easter egg. About 25 host-
esses had pooled pennies for the event; Dan-
gars and Friends and Ilays, Onslows,
McPhillamys, McMasters and Osbornes were
among those listed to keep an eye on the
caterer’s bill and see that the decorations
were the right shades for young and not-so-
young complexions. Handsome black gowns
predominated among the matrons, though
now and again a striking color note was
struck, as in Airs. Alec Hay’s old-rose tissue
with its gold-lace panels. Mrs. Philip Alor-
ton w'alked in beaten silver that carried a
foam of blue and silver tissue, and she gave
the final curl to her costume with a blue
feather fan. Fans were everywhere, many
of them resembling the affairs Cleopatra’s
maiden used to whisk the flies off the August
One while she planned her conquest of
Caesar or Antony. And Mrs. F. AlcMaster
looked like a golden autumn leaf borne on
the wind of the jazz.
A remarkable feature of the Union Club
ball last week was the fact that champagne
was provided. And not Australian cham-
pagne either, but the imported variety,
which works out at not less than 30s. a
bottle. Alany members were against the
provision of any sort of champagne. The
Club’s expenses are enormous and its lia-
bilities considerable; and a function which
featured “cup” and whisky-and-soda in the
refreshment department would have shown
a big profit without detracting from the
pleasure of the guests. But against this
reasonable argument Tradition shook its
venerable head. The Club had always sup-
plied French champagne and it always
would, damme.
If you were in khaki and were mooching
along by Farmer’s at lunch-time one day last
week you were probably stopped by one of
three anxious-looking men and asked “Are
you Birdwood?” One man who had been
stopped by all three burst out. “Good Lord,
no! Can’t you see I’m only a colonel !"
The three anxious-looking men were the
scout party sent out by the Institute of
Journalists, whose members were waiting
for Birdy to eat an oyster with them. Only
a few minutes late, he arrived preceded by
president Heney and drawing Charlie Kean
in his wake. Bean threw the bouquets to
the visitor, who retaliated. Fred Cutlack
seconded the toast, and claimed that the
General owed his popularity with the Dig-
gers to a name which lent itself so beauti-
fully to abbreviation.
One evening as he was taking a stroll
Birdy met a Digger returning to the lines.
The Digger was, as Birdy puts it, “deli-
cately drunk.” Presently a dog darted out
from somewhere and made a spring and a
snap at Billjim’s legs. Billjim looked down
and shook his head sadly. “Now, yer
wouldn’t,” said he, “yer wouldn’t bite a
’ero, would yer?” “And,” concluded
the General, “he was a hero. Every Aus-
tralian soldier was a hero. If you doubt
my word, ask the people of France.”
This is Mrs. Rooke,
the popular secretary
of the Soldiers’ Wel-
come, and the probable
secretary of one of
the permanent good
works likely to arise
on the foundation
laid by the old. It
was a rigid muni-
cipal by-law that
finally shut the door
of the Welcome,
though the secretary
will tell you in a
whisper that the City
Fathers turned their
blind eye to their
next-door neighbor for nearly a year.
At the races on Saturday woman declined
to hide her symmetry 7 under heavy wraps.
In her thinnest garments she waved an
almost sleeveless arm to departing Summer.
The above-the-elbow sleeve is quite the vogue ;
but where, oh where in this glove-famine is
the misguided wearer to find covering for
her nakedness? The lady who is considered
Mrs. Philip Morton’s double to-day wore a
creation in black and white. The skirt long
and clinging was of the softest white satin,
the rich black silk paletot was lined with
marvellous brocade and had embroideries of
large white flowers, her black hat carried a
barbed-wire entanglement of white ospreys,
the heels of her shoes were jewelled, and in
her hand she carried the high cane so be-
loved of Versailles. Diana and Daphne sup-
ported Lady Davidson, and Beatrice Grif-
fiths sat in the seats of the mighty. Mrs.
Conway Lyon, in white, looked like a tier of
her own wedding-cake, and Mrs. Lionel
Jaques watched the races in subdued color-
ing of navy and tan. The Hughes lady
brought son Roger’s widow, Barbara Bow-
ker's floral taffeta might have stepped out
of a Nursery Rhyme set. Miss Close and
Miss Egan wore their orders, and every
second woman had a rope of ivory bead or
amber.
The week's handsomest bride was Enid
Woolf, daughter of the Arnold Woolfs, of
Perth, who married Malcolm Mackellar. at
St. Mark’s, Darling Point, to the accompani-
ment of a fully-choral service. An exquisite
wedding dress of white duchesse satin car-
ried a train of the one-sided variety; the
rich lace had interludes of the smallest pink
roses; white stephanotis and white roses for
the curve of her arm and a string of pearls
for her neck completed the outfit. Brides-
maids Una Woolf and Doreen Hordern were
in .shot taffeta that had caught the shading
of lilac in the bud. Silver tissue over
pink tulle formed the upper tier of their
dresses, and they wore hats of silver lace
and carried sheaves of mauve water-lilies.
Small trainbearer Mary Hordern was a pink-
rosebud. D’Arcy Donkin looked after the
bridesmaids, and the ’groom received sup-
port from Captain Hinton. The bride being
a niece of the Sam Horderns, Babworth was
flung open to the guests. Mrs. Woolf re-
ceived in blaek-and-gold froeking.
This is a photograph of Lambert’s portrait
of Etta Close, good friend to over 2000 Aus-
tralian lads who passed through her club
that was within
coo-ee of Selfridges
and the Marble Arch.
It was in 1917 that
Miss Close first
realised that the Aus-
tralian commissioned
youngster had no
club to call his own
in London. Till then
all her efforts had
oeen directed towards
helping the Belgian
refugees. Six weeks
after she saw what
young One Pip was
up against she and a
kindly Oxfordshire
nejghb o r h a d
financed and opened
the club. What that
port of c;ill meant to the boys they will
never tire of telling you, and Miss Close on
her part never tires of issuing an illuminated
gilt-edged certificate of good conduct to the
Australian boys.
Last week Josephine Scriven. of Wirrah
station, Mungindi, married her returned sol-
dier. Telford Murray, of Urallie, Moree, at
St. Mary’s. Sister Nell was bridesmaid, and
Mrs. Scriven entertained a party 100 strong
at the Australia.
Among the debs, at the Union Club ball
was Gertrude Toohey, daughter of the Jack
Tooheys; her mother was the good-looking
Miss Cosgrove, who reigned for many a
season. Daughter inherits mother’s charm.
Frank Otter, who ever since he left
Oxford 20 years ago has been one of the
best-known of London men-about-town and
wits, is on the Orvieto, bound for Sydney.
He served in S’Africa with the 7th Dragoon
Guards; but poor health kept him out of
this war.
The orphan girls of St. Martha’s Home
give you a chance to help the funds on Fri-
day, when a supper dance will take place
at the Paddington Town Hall. The music
is to be alluring, the decorations are in
the hands of a capable committee, and the
affair promises to be one of the happy little
things that you will remember.
The awesome fly specimens exhibited by
the Health 'Department at the Baby Show
reminded a visitor of the woman who was
giving her baby its afternoon bottle. “Oh,
look,’’ said the visitor, “there’s a fly in the
bottle.” “That’s quite all right, my dear,”
replied the mother comfortably. “It can’t
come through the teat.”
The death notices of the week contained
the name of Mrs. Catherine Methven, relict
of Captain Methven, who died at Folke-
stone, England. She was the eldest daughter
of George Allen, and he was the first soli-
citor admitted to practice in N. S. Wales
(1825).
Painter Gruner always takes his holidays
when summer lights up Australia till all
sense of mystery is lost. But the beginning
of autumn makes him pick up his brushes
again and return to the problem of morning
light, which he has attacked so brilliantly
in several well-known canvases. His latest
sketching-ground is Palm Beach, and he has
brought back three Or four cool gems. Next
time he is caricatured he should be shown
holding an alarm-clock to the ear of a
sleeping magpie.
The up-to-date bride doesn’t allow
Romance to blind her eyes to the commercial
value of the wedding-gift. One little lady
whose georgette and ninon undies were lately
packed for the honeymoon cast an apprais-
ing eye over the mountain of silver and
near-silver that had arrived with the wishes
of family friends, and on the eve of the
wedding day bartered the whole with a
jeweller for a string of pearls—plate and
china to be allowed to remain on view in
the parental abode till the last wedding-guest
had departed.

Put “Vallo” on Guard
Give your Sheep the protection that is embodied in
every packet of “VALLO.” Remove every possi-
bility of uncertainty. There are no failures where
this reliable preparation is used, and there can
be no infection when your flocks have been through “VALLO.”
Powder SHEEP DIP
possesses merits which no Woolgrower should overlook. It is not an
expei iment. Its equality to the best Dip ever on the market has been
firmly established by leading Pastoralists everywhere. Its growing
popularity is due to demonstrated efficiency and service. Every claim
for “VALLO” can be substantiated by performance records.
Look for the
Trade Mark.

The Rich Man’s WATCH.
The New Tariff puts only 25 per cent, ad val. duty on the rich
man’s watches, but imposes (descriptive word, imposes) 45 per
cent, ad val. duty on the Poor Man’s Watches. WHY?
Most rich men buy the expensive but good English watches.
Most poor men buy the reliable but lesser-priced Swiss Watches.
Encourage British indutry! Yes; but England NEVER DID,
and now CANNOT, produce the cheaper good watches. Then why
tax our people to the extent of one-half the cost of a watch? We
cannot hope to make watches in Australia until population is
larger.
Fortunately, we have thousands of watches that came in before
the New Tariff imposition, and we are still able to sell at the
old prices.
But buy before the inevitable rise.

To prove the truth of this claim, artist

parison before ”audiences totalling over

Hadji: There’s a yarn, no doubt. But
you don’t tell it, you only suggest it.... Wirths’
Park: This rag made no statements that it
afterwards withdrew about any of the trio....
C.E.R.: Can’t acknowledge pars. If we explained
why we threw things out there would be no space
left to throw anything into... .No. 1: No use sending
stamps for return of paragraphs.... Emanco: Pub par
top general. This paper is a whale for hard, concrete
facts Orpheus: You’re wasting paper, and paper
is becoming as expensive almost as vice in “society”
and as rare as virtue at the same address. .. .Coogee:
It is the case in some reaches; depends on the
vagaries of the tide. ... (105) : “The Guardian of
the Fish Shop” is still below standard. .. .D.J.8.:
Not enough there... .J.C.8.: “Old Fashioned Street”
is a very dull thoroughfare... .R.P. (Bondi): You’ve
got an idea, but don’t seem to know quite what
to do with it.... Penslip: Those wild and wicked
deeds don’t thrill u5....R.M. (Vic.): “The synco-
pated, plaintive sound” of bleating sheep made us
fall down three times and then take to prayer....
8.C.: “Point of View” not up.... Judy’s Joe: Halt-
ing & rse about things that don’t matter.. . .C.L.8.:
Dust and cheerfulness are good subjects, but the verse
doesn’t carry them... .K.K.: No, thanks... .5.J.8.:
* There have been worse attempts. .. .Matilda’s Mate:
Poor lament... .Dorme I.: Verse about the usual
girl who is dead. Sorry, but we’re not a'tombstone.
(P.S. —On second thoughts, we’re not sorry.)... .E.O.
(Melb.): Wooden.. . .1.F.: “The Blue Mountains”
misses... .E.M.L.: For Heaven’s sake don’t try to
rhyme “laughter” with “daughter”... .William B.:
One vivid fragment:—
There flutters past a bluey, who bears misfortune
plain enough ;
There hoves in view a desert ship of wool;
A gleam of white-rooted houses around a corner of
a bluff.
A whistle, rattling brakes, and we’ve took the
township pull.
. ...E.J.11.: Interest in J boats is down to
{ p.c M.K.S.: They don’t quite do it... .L.R.8.:
Not striking enough fot a shocking example....
P.McG.: N0....R.M. (Mosman): Nice clean copy
about nothing.... A.G.J.: Don’t care for them.
There’s something in that “Behold!” note that
won’t d 0.... Kelly: Vei'se won’t pass... .L.R.K.:
Sympathise with your longing for the bush. Do you
meet bad poets, too ?.... Riverina: Those jokelets
have been worked rather too often... .M.M.M.: “Dug
Out” doesn’t suit. ...E.W.S.: Your work is good
enough. But can’t you find better clay to make your
bricks with?... .O.B.: Ah, this will buck them up:
. ...E.J. (Murwillumbah) : Some of the lines are all
right. Get to work and make the rest of them
right.... Don: Not nearly... .M.R.: Very etude....
M.M.: “Factory Girl” doesn’t get a j0b....E.M.L.:
“Butterflies” hasn’t the touch ; the other is all
astray T.K.8.: The movement is du11... .Mary L.:
No joy in it. .. .A.R.E.: Cheer up. A temper like
that must be very uncomfortable. .. .Pierce B.:
Rather heavy fooling.... A. E.K.: No use to us
L.Wj (Hamilton): Playlet didn’t get hold of u 5....
Curdnatta: As far as we can read it is no g00d....
Win: You take too many words to say anything
L.L.: Just middling... .St. Gad: Not much of a
subject and not much of a handling A.S.:
“Delilah” has some color, but the work is uneven.
Borrow the lady’s shears and trim it. .. .F.J.M.:
“Prince of Adjectives” misses, but not by a mile... .
J.H.F.: Andrew goes digging for a bees’ nest and
finds a blowflies’. Well, well!. ... C. J.W.: “Beauty”
moves clumsily in difficult metre. .. .D 1135: Not well

Not enough in the lion P.C. (Brisbane) :' Don’t
believe it Bill B.: Doesn’t get near A.K.: If
you are after press publicity sit down for Lesson I.
—Don’t crowd your typewritten lines so that a sub-
editor’s pen can’t push in.... Hempen Oord: Don’t
know of any case except that of F. F. Turner, of
S. Aus. He was sworn in as Attorney-General
though not in either House. A political appoint-
ment was made a month or two later XYZ:
Ah, yes; but that contributor was careful to say
that that hair was naturally light on those abas....
Vere: There is as much music in it as in a motor-
bike.... W. Turner: You lose half what you would
have won had the horse won alone, and also half
your stake Mamina: For the part played by
Feisul’s troops see London Times “History of the
War,” or Wedgwood Benin’s “In the Side-shows.”
The disorderly savages who said they were the
legions of the Emir, and then betrayed you to the
Turks and attacked you in the rear, can hardly be
accepted as witnesses of truth.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E. Long: The vampire is falling over... .N.McB.:
Put the labor into the drawing, not into the wit.
Yid: We won’t aim that at them.... Phil T.:
Plenty of work and ink but no humor C.R.S.:
Cramped little thing several weeks late... .K.W.C.:
Unsuitable... .C.C.S.: Good old gag, bad new draw-
ing.... F. 8.: You’ve got nearly everything to learn.
. ...L.S.: Boxer knocked out in first round....
M.C.R.: Both left struggling. .. .H.C.McK.: You
draw firm, anyway. Work on M.S.: Why go for
that glimmering hair-line effect? It is monotonous
and gets you nowhere. .. .A.8.W.: Apparently Irish
country types of 50 years ago. No market....
F.K.: Poet looks as if he had tried hard but
been thrown.... R.L.: Don’t want to discourage you,
but those exams, look more important than art
studies at this stage F.A.8.: Admiral Sims, is
it? Thought you were trotting out Sousa... .L.E.H.:
Album work N.A.H.: The girl isn’t on a shelf;
she is sitting on a straight line supported by nothing.
Colonel W. T. Reay, who has been made
a C.B.E. for running the special constab-
ulary in London during the war, had a
narrow escape from being appointed Vic.
Chief of Police just before Sainsbury was
selected. He was well in the running for a
few weeks. Then he grew better satisfied
with his job as general manager of Mel-
bourne Hekald and dropped the strings.
These are the heroes of the hour,
The bloom of aviators;
The youth, the pride, of Australia’s flower,
That shines and binds us to our colors.
Oh, how our hearts in us do swell,
No tong-ue nor pen can tell;
To see these boys so well, so well,
Home again, again to dwell.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PALMS and schooners and mango trees,
And negroes chattering overside,
The plash in the shallows of tiny seas
And the lone, low cries of the homing tide;
Heart o’ mine, ’tis the dream we knew
As dreams are known in the cool white
South, , . . .
Ere Beauty uprosf* from the swathing blue
Like a song to the heart and a kiss to the
mouth.
Blossoms and baskets and strings of beads.
And a weird, low chaunt on the old land s
lip, . ,
While Fancy follows where A lsion leads
To the wise, warm moon on the mast or
a ship; „ , , ,
To the curl of the bay, the lurch of the land,
To the pearl o’ the wave and over beyond,
Where the wind walks in with a cool little
hand
To rustle the ribboned banana-frond.
A scarlet bandanna, the bow of a boat,
The grape-fruit’s gay little globes of gold.
The laughter of ships in the harbor’s throat,
And the land-mist flowing in, fold on fold;
Moths and moonlight and magic and musk,
The flutter of sails and a mandolin
Playing across thrQU**i the liannted dusk,
Where the slim white schooners pass out
and in.
Slim white schooners that gleam and glide
Like satined maidens across my sight,
And the land’s soft voice and the crooning
tide
Bring Memory.close to my heart to-night;
So the wonderful things of my far-off land,
Snow-pale wind and the whip o’ the rain.
And the last cool touch of your trembling
hand
Have led my heart to the South again.
To the hills’ bare waist where the pathway
turns
Like a wearied man to the dim green
glades,
Where the stream lilts down through the
wrinkled ferns
And Echo toys with the far cascades;
To manuka paths and the fume of broom
Jewelled and drenched by the marching
showers,
And the shrill, keen red of the rata-bloom,
And the mystical beauty of kowhai flowers.
Palms and schooners and sequined skies,
And odorous flowers that heavily sweep
The curving brow and the droop of the eyes
With the pollen of dreams and the petals
of sleep-
Sleep and dreams in the shadowy West.
The dim night rises and swiftly flows;
God give me sleep and the deep, deep rest
And the dreams that only a rover knows.

BOYCE BOWDEN.
Miss Vavasour’s Appearance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AWD!” said Fred Lonely’s stupe-
I ~w~ fied friend; “give it a name an’
v you can ’ave it. What is it?”
“That’s old Miss Vav,” Fred said. “Bin
cornin’ ’ere every Sunday for ’er paper—
this last 15 year, it must be, Bert?” turn-
ing to Dir. Pibble behind the counter.
Mr. Pibble looked up and watched Miss
Josephine Vavasour for a moment before he
answered. Mincing across the pavement in
spite of her laborer’s boots, she paused at
the kerb. Fifty summers and winters had
done their .worst with her. Raddled and
pock-marked, a wizened, weather-beaten face
smiled coyly under a large Victorian hat
from whose deck a 6-inch fringe hung.
Fringes of many colors hung and festooned
the lady inexplicably—from her wrists, with
intent to cover the lapse of bare bone' before
the cotton gloves ran to their empty finger-
tips ; from her elbows, her waist and the
edge of her tattered skirt with no intent at
all. She looked as if she had thrown on
the remnants of a theatrical dress-basket of
30 years ago—which she had, barring., the
laborer’s boots. Wavering eyes looked out
of a tremulous, restless face at a harsh, in-
comprehensible world.
“Yes. it’ll be all 15 years since she took
’er first Sunday paper from me. She ’ad
’er old mother with ’er, I remember, who
was in better ’ealth then.”
Fred laughed. “The first time me an’
Mother Peasley met,” he said, “she bit me
for ’alf a crown —for medicine. In ’alf an
hour I saw Miss Vav steerin’ ’er past the
shop, ’oldin’ ’er on ’er feet. Quickest thing
I ever saw.”
Fred’s friend butted in. “What is the
matter with that old oil paintin’?” he said.
Miss Vav had crossed the road and was
sidling and mincing down the sunshine to
the loud applause of the audience, which was
young Coaly Mimbles. The lady, acutely
unconscious of his ribald presence, continued
her dignified, over-played “lead” until she
curtseyed and bridled round the corner.
“She's gettin’ worse,” said Fred.
Mr. Pibble straightened the papers on the
counter. * “You can’t tell much from what
you’re told,” he said to the stranger, with
a hint of reproach in his voice, “not that
you w r ant to, when it’s others’ business. But
she used to come to me at the old shop,
and from the bits o’ things she let fall casual
’erself and what I ’card, I got as near the
strength of it as I wanted to. She ain’t
quite right in ’er mind, Miss Vav ain’t; I
saw’ that when she bought ’er first Sunday
paper from me, and I see it again every
Sunday. ‘The news ’alf for dearest mamma,’
she says, ‘and the theat’ieal ’alf for me.’ ”
“Dearest mamma ain’t much use to ’er,”
Fred Lonely said.
“I dunno as you can say that. Fred, or
who is am- use to anyone. Old Mother
Peasley drinks 'eavy, I know, and some-
times things are bad; Miss Vav came into
the shop once with a black eye—it was
painted over, but it was black all right.
Still, they’re a sort of an anchor for each
other in the last stretch.” Mr. Pibble was
hopelessly mixed in metanhor.
“Mother used to yarn with ’er about that
appearance of ’ers she’s always talkin’
about,” Fred_ said ; “it was that that”
“I know.” Mr. Pibble interrupted. “ ’er
appearance was the trouble from the start.”
‘•Look ’ere,” said Fred’s friend in despera-
tion, “ain’t you ever cornin’ to it? There’s bin
a hell of a lot of talk about this old prawn
an’ ’er appearance (which / think is
awful), but nobody’s said anything yet.
What is the trouble?”
Lonely laughed again. “Tell it to ’im,
Bert,” he said ; “can’t yer see love’s young
dream in ’is face? Tell ’ini about ’is infatua-
tion an’ er dearest mamma.”
Mr. Pibble’s voice was slightly more
remonstrative as he said: "I dunno as
there’s much joke in it, Fred, and 1
dunno as I know much when you come to it.
Polly Peasley was born and bred in the
’Loo, as the sayin’ is. ’Er father died when
she was a kid, and old*Mother Peasley aid a
bit of washin’ and cleanin’, but nothing
reg’lar. Just draggin’ on they were, up in
Corfu-street, near where they are now.
When Polly got to be 16 or 17 she used to
sing in Father Bernard’s concerts in
Mimbles’s shed —little bits of songs, you
know, nothin’ much; but Father Bernard ’as
told me she was a great favorite and quite
wonderful in ’er quiet way. Quiet she was
in every way, simple and shy, not like most
of the ’Loo youngsters. One night Father
Bernard brought Margetson, the theat’ical
manager, to ’is concert” ——
"I toured South Africa with ’im in Gil-
bert and Sullivan. ’E was all right with
me,” said Fred Lonely, as if it had been
suggested that Margetson was all wrong
with somebody.
“Well, he went dilly over Miss Vav's voice
and ’er looks, and went to Mother Peasley
about givin’ ’er daughter a career, as ’e
called it —said she was a gold-mine. What
with one thing an’ another, ’e sent ’er to
London and ’ad ’er educated and trained for
two years. Old Mother Peasley was in clover
—wouldn’t look ’er old friends, they tell
me, except when she’d ’ad one too many.
When Polly came back and was Miss
Josephine Vavasour, understudy and chorus-
girl in Margetson’s company, it was Mother
Peasley who made ’er give up ’er boy and
drop all ’er old friends ’ere. It was a good
thing for Mother Peasley ; no more washin’
an’ cleanin’, plenty to eat —and drink —and
someone else earnin’ the money all the time.”
“Oh, dearest mamma liked it all right,”
Fred said. “But little Miss Vav used to come
sneakin’ down ’ere alone of an afternoon
(pretty as a picture she was), just to look
us over, an’ ’ear ’ow we were doin’. Mother
used to say if it wasn’t for givin’ Mother
Peasley the comforts an’ whatnot Poll’d be
back in the ’Loo in a week. Me an’
Mother”
“That was before my time,” Mr. Pibble
interrupted, taking his own floor again ; “at
the time I’m speakin’ of, the talk was all
of Miss Vav’s appearance in the ‘lead,’
which might come off any week.” Mr. Pibble
sighed and straightened his papers again.
“It ’asn’t come off yet,” he said, as if it
were his own sorrow. “When ’er chance
did come, it near killed ’er. On the day of
’er great appearance as Patienfce she got the
measles on top of ’eavy re’earsin’; and,
instead of puttin’ ’er to bed. ’er mother
’elped ’er to powder and paint ’er face, an’
took ’er in the pourin’ rain to the dress-
re’earsal, where she fainted. When the cur-
tain went up she was in bed, and ravin'.”
Mr. Pibble paused and looked at his audi-
ence for a moment. “You know, Fred,” he
said at last, “yer can’t always tell —it’s ’ard
work judgin’ fair. In old Mother Peasley’s
mind and Miss Vav’s everything was ’angin’
on ’er appearance—everything ’ad bin given
up to it. Polly’s boy, ’er old friends, all the
things that ’ad meant anything to ’er as a
kid and a grown-up girl—even ’er old ways
of talkin’ an’ thinkin’ ’ad bin took from ’er
in London. It’s ’ard to say what a thing
like that measles was for, ain’t it, Fred?
“Yes,” said Fred, economically.
“When she came out of ’ospital, 'er looks
was gone, and ’er nerve an’ three-quarters of
’erself. No manager would give ’er a part;
if one ’ad done she couldn’t ’ave played it.
Shfe looked pretty near as old as she does
now, and she was all wrong in ’er ’ead. She
used to come out in the evenin’s singin’ Yf
there be pardon in your breast’ in a voice
like an old woman's —used to wander up an’
down the streets singin’ it, like she does
now, till you’d think your ’eart’d break.”
“What do they live on?” Fred’s friend
asked.
“Old Mother Peasley’s pension. For 30
years Miss Vav ’as bin sayin’ that things’ll
be better when she makes ’er appearance, bet-
ter for ’er and for ’er mother —’er dearest
mamma, as she calls ’er,” Mr. Pibble said,
looking up and staring gravely and steadily
at Fred Lonely.
Fred’s friend stood up suddenly and looked
out of the door. A shadow swept past him
and stood gasping at Mr. Pibble’s counter —
Miss Vav, hatless, grey and, for once, pur-
poseful. Her eyes burned into Pibble’s face
as she swayed a little on her laborer's boots;
something had wrenched her back to normal.
“Mr. Pibble,” she said in a .stronger voice
than he had heard from her, “I think dearest
mamma is dying. Could you” Miss
Vav gulped, and tottered : her eyes died down
and she slipped off the normal again into a
mumbling, leaden despair.
For a moment Mr. Pibble and his audience
were at a loss; then he straightened up and
called:
“Nell!”
“Yes, dad !” came from the kitchen.
“Mind the shop for me for a bit, my dear,
will yer? I got to go out.” Turning to
Lonely, “Would your friend slip up William-
street to Dr. O’Grady an’ ask him to come
down to Corfu-street, to Mrs. Peasley’s, as
quick as ’e can?”
“Yes.” Fred’s friend said, and went.
Down Cathedral-street Miss Vav went
with her double escort, Lonely staring
straight ahead and Mr. Pibble making clumsy
efforts at comfort. Between them the grey
ghost of Miss Vav seemed to fall along the
pavement rather than walk on it. She said
nothing. Once or twice she turned her head
and looked into Mr. Pibble’s face; he saw
the nameless, questioning fear in her eyes
that he had always seen there, a little
stronger than formerly, perhaps, but that
might have been his own nerves.
In the room a woman was sitting by the
fireplace; the prone figure on the bed was
breathing heavily, giving no other sign of

LEG BROKE OUT IN
Flesh-Eating Uleers.
Could Bury her Fingers in the Holes
—Throbbing Pain was Unbearable.
ZAM-BUK’S SUPERIORITY PROVED
ZAM-BUK is a proved remedy for bad
legs, ulcers and diseased ankles, whether
they be the result of a simple scratch or
sprain, enlarged veins, or a general sloughing
of the flesh into an ulcerous state often brought
on by excessive standing or kneeling. In
thousands of cases, after all other treatments
failed, Zam-Buk has effected a complete and
permanent cure, and, as a typical instance, take
the case of
Mrs. S. Darrell, of 28 Levey Street, Chippen-
dale, Sydney, who writes: “While living at
Woy Woy I had the misfortune to slip and
sprain my ankle. This caused the ankle to
break out in painful ulcers around the ankle-
bone, and the foot swelled to such an extent

that I could not get my boot on. The holes
that the ulcers caused were so deep in the
flesh that I could bury my fingers in them.
I suffered frightful pain during this time, which
gave me no respite night or day and interfered
with my sleep at night, for the burning and
throbbing sensation was unbearable.
‘‘Many remedies were tried during this time,
but they were very unsatisfactory, and only
half-healed the wound, which then broke out
again as bad as ever. At last I was persuaded
to use Zam-Buk. After the first application 1
saw a decided improvement, which grew more
pronounced each day, and after a few weeks*
treatment these terrible ulcers were entirely
healed, after being bad for 15 months, three
months of which I never put my foot to the
ground.
“Several of my friends and prominent
residents of Woy Woy saw my foot before and
after using Zam-Buk, and to show my
appreciation of this splendid ointment I send
you this letter of appreciation and thanks.**
ZAM-BUK IS HEALING—SOOTHING—ANTISEPTIC.
IMPORTANT NOTICE.
When you ask for Zam-

A
life. The room was a tumbled mass of
clothes, Miss Vav’s wardrobe. Lonely threw
the old theatrical’s eye over it and decided
that none of it was worth even packing—
wouldn’t hang together for one show. Mr.
I‘ibble, inarticulate apology embodied, stood
by the door. Miss Yav crept across to the
bed, and Mother Peasley’s eyes opened.
“Mamma dearest, are you better?”
The fevered eyes stared up into the pock-
. - i ked, painted face, but no answer came.
'She 'ad the ’orrors somethink awful when
you was out, Polly,” the woman by the fire-
place said without looking up; “it was all
I could do to get ’er away from the winder
an’ back into bed. This is ’er last go all
right, it won’t be a long one.”
Miss Yav leaned over the bed to put the
dishevelled hair into place. The livid face on
the pillow suddenly snarled.
Don't touch me, yer bitch; you keep
yer ’ands orf me. ’ The horrible voice tore
into Mr. Pibble’s ears; no voice he had ever
heard was like it; an animal’s, perhaps, a
mad animal’s.
A sharp blow and a gasp, and Miss Yav
reeled across the room, her hand to her head.
Lonely took a step forward and stood help-
less, while Miss Yav subsided to the floor.
Hie hoarse voice from the bed surged over
the room again.
“The King ain’t coinin’ ter-day.” Savage
eyes peered into each face in turn as the
voice dropped a tone. “No, not ’e—'e wouldn’t
couie ’ere to the likes o’ me.” The voice rose
again, sweeping up into a foul scream, an
apotheosis of bestial despair. “In an’ out,
in an’ out and the sgo all day long; no
peace from ’em, no peace. You Polly, yer
bitch, look at wot yer done to me, look at
yer old mum with workin’ ’er fingers to the
bone fer ’er looney good-fer-nothin’ gal—me
lunatic daughter. ’ Mother Peasley’s eyes
flitted restlessly about the corners of the
room.
“Gawd!” she whispered suddenly, “there
they are, in an’ out. in an’ out. ’Ere, keep
’em orf, keep ’em orf. . . .Christ, Polly, carn’t
yer keep ’em orf me? Ah!”....
Mother Peasley half rose on her arm ; the
scream rang and echoed in the last carrion-
pit of terror, and broke in a strangled sob ;
silence fell. The livid head fumbled back
upon the pillow ; here was quiet death and
sanity at last.
“If there bo pardon in your breast for a
poor penitent.” Dry and thin, the prayer
quavered up, Miss Yav rocking from side to
side on her knees. Mr. Pibble took a deep
breath and crossed himself; even Fred
Lonely looked up suddenly, his memory far
away down the years.
“Ah, pore thing! Polly’s last chance ’as
gone. She 11 ’ave to go to Callan Park now.”
Jllig stolid woman was drawing a sheet over
the grey face on the pillow.
Vav stumbled to her feet and Mr.
1. lbblc saw again the hunted fear leap into
her eyes at the woman’s words. Dr. O’Grady
and Fred’s friend came into the room.
“It’s not true—it’s not true!” Miss Yav’s
voice cut into the tragic strain of the room :
her haggard eyes searched each face. “It
was mamma there,” throwing a wide gesture
towards the bed, “with her dreadful habits,
who'was a lunatic. You know, Mr. Pibble;
this time has only been a rest after my ill-
ness ; it was to be a good rest to make ready
for my appearance. And mamma wouldn't
let me rest.... so dreadful —so dreadful....
You do know that, don’t you? You just saw
her die, and you know that she was the mad
one. She stopped me rehearsing my songs—
she wouldn’t let me work. Sometimes she
hit” Miss Yav’s voice trailed into nothing
as her eyes shadowed over. Her lips shook;
despairing tears slipped glistening down her
painted cheeks as she looked again from face
to face. “They can’t take me away, can
they? They can’t—they can’t!”
A great wrath rose in Lonely’s heart.
Prom the beginning there had been nothing
—nothing in the world—for Miss Vav. A
darkened mind, and pain and sorrow; hunger
and a drunken mother; blows and a pauper’s
madhouse. The sweat was cold on his fore-
head as he beckoned to Mr. Pibble's white
face.
“My God, Bert, I can’t stand this. Ain’t
there some way we can fix it with doctor —
some private place or somethin’ ? We c’d
back it; I don’t s’pose it’d be much; an’
some o’ the old theat’icap gang’d come in.”
O’Grady was looking gravely at the terror
haunting Miss Vav’s restless eyes. Over by
the window he listened to Lonely and Pibble.
"Yes,” he growled, apparently sentencing
them to death, “there’s a man I know, a
retired medical man, who’s got a place where
he takes one mental patient; his last
boarder’s just gone. It’ll cost you £2 a week
for your share; can you do it?” lie
glowered at the two criminals in the dock.
“Yes,” Fred said. “It would be all right
somehow.”
“It won’t be for long”—O’Grady com-
muted the sentence. “Her heart’s at about
its last tick; when this gets into her mind
it should nearly finish it for her —at last.”
he added, frowning heavily at a heap of
hats. “Get a cab here, Pibble. in half an
hour; I’ll go and ring up Meredith.”
At the end of the half-hour young Fred’s
cab created a ’Loo sensation. Inside, Miss
Vav played “lead” while Fred (who had
taken on the escort job as part of his theat-
rical duty to God ) played “second,” a heavy
part made up of reassurances as to this final
preparation in the country air for Miss Vav's
appearance. On the kerb Mr. Pibble and
Fred’s friend watched them go.
“Oh, ’er appearance is all right,” Mr.
P bide said in reply to the subdued stranger,
“she'll be makin’ it pretty soon now, I
think.”
FRANCIS BRIEN.
The Sliprail Shuffler.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A man knocking about the bush
samples a good many kinds of mates,
and each has some singularity. In
most of the essentials that count in mate-
ship, Little Peter could be classed A 1 at
Battlers. He never tried to shirk getting
wood and water, making the fire, or hunt-
ing for horses; and in ordinary circum-
stances he was dependable. In our travels
together I discovered only one blemish in
lps otherwise estimable character.
The long, winding road up the Maranoa
was crossed at intervals by squatters’ and
selectors’ fences, several occurring close after
one another as you got near homesteads. The
practice where dismounting was necessary
was for mates to manipulate barriers turn
about, because one might be light, clean and
handy, and another heavy, muddy sliprails
in a boghole.
Some men didn’t like getting off, especi-
ally on a drizzly day when the saddles were
dry and warm. I knew two who started
out together with good intentions, but whose
mateship lasted only a day through the
golden rule respecting fences not being
strictly adhered to. One was very willing;
he urged his horse forward when there was
anything to open or put down. All day
he did this without a sign of remonstrance.
But next morning he said: “You go your
way now and I’ll go mine.”
A familiar type of mate was one who
wanted to do all the opening at the start.
He was quite pleased to be of use, and even
protested if not allowed to be the blackboy.
But it wasn’t long before his enthusiasm
evaporated, and he was cutting up tobacco
or lighting his pipe when a fence was
reached.
Peter was neither of these. He wasn’t
lazy, and if he avoided any unpleasant duty
he did it in a way that imparted no sus-
picion of design to the casual observer.
I had ridden a long way with Peter before
I noticed certain subtle peculiarities about
his horses. When there was an easily-opened
gate ahead they stepped forward briskly as
if they thought it was the day’s end. When
it was a ricketty affair that had to be lifted
back, or one that obviously collapsed on being
unfastened, they acted differently, If the
structure opened to the left, they liked to
be on the near side of my horses; and if the
concern opened to the right, they preferred
the offside. In each case it brought me up
against the gatehead. But when they saw
sliprails in front they didn't seem to care
if they never got there, and sometimes they
were startled by something wholly imaginary,
and plunged off the road.
Generally a gate was opened by the leader
and closed by the one following. Some were
self-closing affairs that had to be followed
and held back; others, as on rabbit-proof
fences, were heavy-weight sliders. I became
aware that Peter was an expert who classi-
fied them at a distance. But it wasn’t till
we reached a pair of light sapling rails that
I was particularly impressed.
“These are the sort I like,” said Peter;
“they’re as handy as a bad gate.” And
ranging alongside he leaned over in the
saddle and dropped one end of the rails.
Then he rode on, leaving me to put them
up.
A few miles farther cn we came to a sharp
turn in a patch of scrub where Peter, who
was slightly in advance, was not expecting
impediments; but suddenly he noticed heavy
split rails with a puddle underneath. At
the same instant the halter on his packhorse
slipped out of his hand, and he had to turn
round and do some manoeuvring to recapture
the quadruped. Then he stopped a moment
to overhaul the headgear, and to ascertain if
the pack was firm and in proper position on
the moke’s back.
I got interested in Tittle Peter. He was
a man of ideas, who never used the same
trick twice in a day. If his special apti-
tude for dodging sliprails was appealed to
20 times in 20 miles, he always had some-
thing fresh. He rarely resorted to such
ordinary practices ns filling his pipe, or drop-
ping things to get behind, and only once did
a flying-ant get in his eye.
We called at a squattage not long after
negotiating the puddle, and when leaving
we had to pass through a yard which pre-
sented two high tiers of heavy rails.
"Something to put down here,” Peter re-
marked, and urged his horse forward.
1 was as much surprised as pleased at this
departure, when all at once his packhorse
jumped back and pulled away. Peter had
sprung a new one on me.
By chance as lie rode through I noticed a
spot of blood where his spur had pricked
the horse in the chest.
From this place a stockman accompanied
us across two paddocks. He knew Peter,
and as there was not room for five horses
abreast on the bush-track, I jogged along
behind. It was a foregone conclusion the
new man was to be blackboy, and I was
curious to see how Peter would accomplish
it, as most stockmen were up to the tricks
of sliprail shufflers.
The first barrier was a new gate, which
was leaning against the posts waiting for
its hinges. Peter observed its unfinished
condition several rods away, and just then
he recollected that he had lost a horse some-
where on the run when going down with
cattle. He did not know the name of the
place, but, taking out his pocket-book, said
he would make a .sketch of the locality so
that the stockman might keep a lookout when
mustering there. He was intensely absorbed
in tracing roads and creeks and lagoons
when the horses came to a standstill. The
stockman got off. but there was a grin on
his face as he lifted the obstruction from
the track.
The next obstacle consisted of low slip-
panels in ordinary split posts. The buckle
on the end of Peter’s l'eins had just come
undone, letting one drop, when the stockman
pressed his hat down, and, racing at the
bander, went over like a bird. Waving his
hand to us on the other side, he cantered
off’ into the bush.
Peter was too flabbergasted to return the
courtesy. “There’s some mean'blokes ab’out
here,” he growled as he dismounted.
