The Red Page
Fact, and Its Proper Place
A reviewer of Conrad’s collected works re-
marked recently that the root of his authors
power of conviction lay in his habit of bas-
ing his stories on real incidents. "It is this
sense of contact with life that gives to his
pages the feeling that things happened so
and no otherwise.” Whereupon an ancient
admiral arose to throw doubt on the matter.
There was the story of Lord Jim, for in-
stance. Lord Jim, it appears, was no roman-
tic dreamer whose imagination made him
jump from his ship before it sank, and
whose honor forced him subsequently to seek
some remote corner of the Malay Archi-
pelago to work out his salvation. The real
Lord Jim was a rather sluggish person who
was accidentally left behind when a pilgrim
ship, owned by an Arab in Singapore, was
scuttled and descried; and he afterwards
found a comfortable billet in a ship-
chandler’s, where he waxed fat and pros-
pered.
A rather shabby story altogether, very
different from the romance Conrad brought
to a close among the Dyaks of the Patusan!
But does it nullify the claim that Conrad’s
power of conviction lies in basing his stories
on real incidents? Well, hardly. Art is not
Life, but something else. It is an attempt to
construct a world in which happenings will
be orderly and significant, instead of con-
fused and meaningless; and to follow out
the details of some actual story would merely
mean an imitation of the inconsequence of
life. The story of the real Lord Jim, for
instance, was probably not worth writing, or,
if it was, the incident of the sinking ship
was not a crucial point in it. Conrad, in-
stead of attempting to make bricks without
straw, lets his imagination play upon the
incident and evolves a character to whom
failure in such a crisis would be a turning-
point in his career, tracing his struggles to
win back honor and self-respect till they
reach some kind of finality. That is the
way of Art, the inevitable way.
Where Life comes in is in the matter of
suggestion. The world that the writer con-
structs must necessarily be an image of the
real one. He has to build with ordinary
earth, water and trees, and liis characters
must be moved by natural impulses. His
power, of illusion, indeed, depends on the
truth and vividness with which he can repro-
duce the world of fact; and what better be-
ginning for a story than an incident that
has actually happened, with all its fresh
and convincing details growing around it?
Life is always offering hints and suggestions
to a writer, or working out dramas in its
crude, unfinished way. He has only to take
what he wants and shape it to his own ends.
We don’t ask that he should keep to his
original material with literal exactness: we
merely demand that his creation shall keep
the illusion of life while presenting a world
that is clearer, intenscr and more compre-
hensible than the one we see around us.
At least some of us do. There *are others
who are more interested in the scattered
sources from which the artist drew his
material than in the finished work itself.
They Will hunt for the farm where Tess of
the D’Urbervilles worked in order to shed
sentimental tears in the milking-byre, or they
will boast that they knew a man who knew
the Man from Snowy River. Often writers
play up to this witless curiosity by pretend-
ing that their characters were lifted straight
from life, with not a feature altered. In this
they are false to their' craft. They know,
none better, that the character they created
had no real identity with the one that first
set their imaginations working, and that the
scenes he moved among were arbitrarily
changed. “The man who suggested Willems
to me,” says Conrad of one of his charac-
ters, “was not particularly interesting in
himself.” Just so. And the originals of
Tess or Emma Bovary would have no inter-
est, either, for the sort of people who seek
for them. By some chance contact they set
the wheels of literary creation moving—that
is all their importance. A friend of mine
was once a model for Rodin, but he could
never get any personal satisfaction from
looking at the images of himself, much as he
admired the work of the sculptor.
But why shouldn’t writers trust more to
their imaginations, it may be asked. Why
should they be dependent for characters and
incidents on the accidents of a narrow ex-
perience? The answer is that the imagina-
tion is a very limited thing, as far as its
inventive power is concerned. It tends to
run in well-defined grooves. Read the
cheaper magazines, or the novels written for
factory-girls, if you want to see it working
at high pressure. The same situations, the
same wooden characters, or, if it is a detec-
tive story, the same return to Poe and
Gaboriau! Inventive power is a mathemati-
cal quality rather than a literary one. A
writer could only trust to it at the risk
of being monotonous. It repeats itself: it
has nothing to work on but the inventions of
other men, and it is only a small and un-
important part of the imagination, anyhow.
Life, on the other hand, is infinitely varied,
and never repeats itself in precisely the
same terms. It has never even created two
faces exactly alike. There are innumerable
ways in which it can combine, and its situ-
ations have nearly always a slightly un-
expected quality. The creative writer, there-
fore, generally turns to his memory for the
materials of his art. Some experience of
his own supplies the dynamic to set his
imagination working, and from characters
gathered from diverse quarters (often
Mended, enlarged, amputated) he builds his
little world. To keep vitality in his cre-
ation he needs the freshness of detail he has
seen with his own eygs; but, apart from that,
it is generally reality that has supplied him
with the original impulse to create.
Imaginative work, then, does not depend
on mere invention, which is quite a minor
quality. Third-rate men have often excelled
at weaving ingenious plots, and the chroni-
cler of Arsene Lupin’s adventures had more
imagination of this sort than Shakspeare.
“You invent too much,” Tolstoi said to the
youthful Gorky, meaning that he let his vir-
tuoso quality run away with him. There is
better work for the imagination. By the in-
tensity of its brooding on remembered inci-
dents it can so impregnate them that they
emerge charged with meaning and signifi-
cance, perhaps with beauty. Thus we find
even a romantic writer like Conrad basing
his work on personal experience and gaining
a powerful illusion from it, though to the
men who sailed with him the world he dis-
covered in remote seas probably seemed quite
different.
VANCB PALMER.
Dogma and Poetry
When John Wesley wrote the preface to
an uninspired collection of hymns to be sung
by Methodists he left behind him a rare bit
of egotism. Never before had a man pub-
licly dogmatised with such assurance on a
matter of which he had so slender a know-
ledge. That preface was rivalled by a note
on the value of his own work from the pen
of Martin Tupper, but never quite equalled
until a few weeks ago, when Mr. Norman
Lindsay prefaced “Poetry in Australia,
1923,” with an expression of his views on
poetry. For sheer Methodist dogmatism it
holds pride of place; and the noise thus
made dulls much of the real beauty of the
verse collected in the volume.
Let ns take one of the dogmatic state-
ments. Mr. Lindsay writes:—
It understands simply that when Greek ceased to
be the active material in defining poetry, its function
passed to the most fluid medium in words now
existing’ on earth. Homer, Sappho and Shakspeare
are, therefore, all equal expressions in that national-
ism of Mind whose country is poetry. Other lan-
guages may have contributed good exercises in poetry,
but that creative energy which recreates all other
expressions of itself has but two sources: Greek
and English.
Mr. Lindsay does not say that this is
his opinion, that his reading has led him to
think it probable, or that men of ample
scholarship have hinted at it; he asserts it
with full dogmatic assurance. We are, there-
fore, forced to conclude that he claims a com-
plete acquaintance with half a dozen lan-
guages and the poets of nearly 30 centuries.
Lyric work, from its very nature, cannot be
translated, and it is in the lyric that a lan-
guage most reveals itself; so all second-hand
knowledge is worthless in a matter of such
depth and sweep. But admitting that Mr.
Lindsay knows all languages and has read
all poetry and sees English so far surpass-
ing them all as “the most fluid medium in
words,” the reader is forced to ask why he
does not himself use this English as a means
of expression. When he says, “For all seri-
ous values in poetry must reside in the con-
crete image, which must be defined by a
curve in emotional rhythm,” he is certainly
not writing the English language, but mak-
ing a complicated noise in what may here-
after be known as the Lindsay tongue. If
the English of Shakspeare is so good, why
discard it for a shibboleth of grandiose absur-
dity ? The use of such a shibboleth utterly
shakes the reader’s faith in Mr. Lindsay’s
judgment of English poetry. How can a
man who writes like this possibly under-
stand our great simple singers? What would
Shakspeare or Milton or Keats have said of
such a poisonous jargon?
But when Mr. Lindsay says things in Eng-
lish his grotesque utterances become interest-
ing. Here is another passage
In other words, that gigantic impetus sent forth
into futurity by Shakspeare and the Elizabethans
maintained its vibrant energy, in spite, of such
temporary sterilisations as the Augustan Age and
the Lake School, until the re-affirmation of passion
and beauty in poetry at the dawn, of last century,
which has kept it in action till to-day.
So out go the Lake poets with one generous
sweep of the pen. Poor Samuel Taylor
Coleridge! Alas for the sterilisation of
English poetry through the publication of
the “Ode to France,” “Cristabel,” “The
Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner” and “Kubla
Khan”! Coleridge was the prince of the
Lake School; and the new Methodist dogma
declares that he was sterile! But who re-
affirmed the passion and beauty of poetry at
the beginning of last century if not the so-
called Lake poets? I have very little use
for the term, but in all acceptance the Lake
School means Coleridge, Wordsworth and
Southey, with a few smaller people, and
sometimes Scott. Were these not the very
poets of the re-affirmation, the poets whose
work made Keats, Shelley and Byron pos-
sible? Byron imitated and improved upon
the methods of Southey and Scott; Shelley,
a devoted admirer of Southey, caught his
chief note from Coleridge; and Keats found
his great master in Milton, whose work had
gained a new acceptance because Coleridge
told Englishmen for the first time how great
the author of “Paradise Lost” really was.
But though Mr. Lindsay, on his own em-
phatic showing, is quite negligible as a critic
of English poetry, this preface and the book
of which it is the foreword have a direct
interest for Australians, as presenting a view
of our poetic attainments to possible English
readers. Mr. Lindsay writes:—
We in Australia who have for years watched this
projection intently have been assured that its initial
utterance must lead again to those dynamic expres-
sions of creative energy which would carry a dying
age back to vitality of Mind, and rid us for a little
of the primitive beast in man triumphant over all
vital issues in Life and Art.
Through the smother of clumsy verbiage
this must be taken to mean that Mr. Lindsay
has been looking for health and cleanliness
in poetry; and we are naturally led to look
for health and cleanliness in this volume of
verse which he sends forth. That it con-
tains plenty that is clean and healthy is
true —it could hardly be otherwise in Aus-
tralia—but most of the healthy verse is old,
written long before 1923. When we approach
the date that gives title to the volume we
find that many of the verses ring the changes
ori the one theme of animal lust. On page
115 there is a lady—and it is a lady’s work
—who begs Corin in very good verse to strip
her of all her clothing, if he must, but to
leave her shoes on. On page 123 the Poet
tells the Man in- his opening lines that he
does not mind if he does what even a decent
animal would recoil from doing. Between
pages 69 and 73 a gross sort of seduction is
cleverly handled at great length. A score
of similar attempts to “rid us a little of the
primitive beast” are to be found scattered
throughout the volume. Whether the skill

Dignity and
Polish.
THE reason why you look
twice at that fine speci-
men of manhood is be-
cause everything is in keeping
—from his well-shaped boots
to the polish and dignity given
by an Akubra hat—Australian
made, by highly-skilled Aus-
tralian labor from Australian
materials. This is an Akubra
year. Before you purchase
insist upon seeing and pricing
an Akubra hat; they are of|
all shapes and sizes—for the
man on the land, for the pro-
fessional man and for the city
business man.

“Wireless and Ethics.”
In a leading article in the “Sydney Morning-
Herald” of Saturday, 15th December, atten-
tion was drawn to the remarkable evidence
of two scientists, Mr. F. H. Marriott, one of
the British representatives to the Pan Pacific
Congress, and Mr. F. Basil Cooke, who
recently spoke oil this interesting subject to
the Institute of Journalists.
Both these gentlemen were quoted as giving
detailed statements with regard to some of
the beneficial results of Wireless, other than
Broadcasting, and its value from an ethical
point of view.
i< I .
Seek the advice of
Mr. F. BASIL COOKE, F.R.A.S.,
on all Radio matters.
David Jones’ have been fortunate in
securing the services of Mr. F. Basil
Cooke, F.R.A.S., and all those interested
in Wireless or Broadcasting can take
advantage of his expert advice and know-
ledge before purchasing a Broadcasting
service.
In these early and experimental days,
when the science of Wireless is still new
in Australia, it is necessary to have this
expert advice so that the Public may feel
that what they purchase will give the
service they require.
Advice is given freely on any subject
small or large relative to Wireless. You
are advised to get in touch with David
Jones’ Radio Department, 22 York Street,
and have any point that you are in doubt
about made plain.
Write for a copy of Booklet : “Radio
—a Simple and Concise Explanation

with which this general appeal to animalism
is put forth does or does not justify its pub-
lication is quite open to argument. No sane
person need object to the nude in verse any
more than to the nude in sculpture or paint-
ing ; but these “concrete images” of lust are
very different from the honest nude. They
are not the fancies of well-bathed and life-
chpnken youth, but the heavy imaginings
of. gloating, mottle-faced age. There is a
reek of hot, overscented rooms about them.
Stableyards and minor Greek deities and
swashbuckling highwaymen are introduced
as stage properties; but sunlight and air
are never really admitted and nobody men-
tioned has much to do with the real business
of living. Such work generally dies swiftly,
and is only remembered among the literary
curiosities of the sick ages ; but why the dis-
ease should strike Australia in the whole-
some year 1923 is something of a mystery.
Possibly it is because the trick of writing in
this way is so easy to acquire and the “con-
crete image” can be presented with so little
exercise of “Mind”; possibly it is just a
summer rash which a better literary diet
and a little honest thought may cure. Still,
in the light of the fact that no book of verse
so dirtied with the paws of “the primitive
beast” has ever before been published in
Australia, the dogmatic preface looks a little
like hypocrisy. As an Australian anthology,
a book which ignores the work of Roderic
Quinn, Frank Morton (some of his best work
was done in 1923), E. ,L Brady, ,T. le Gay
Brereton. Bernard O’Dowd, Arthur H.
Adams, Boyce Bowden, C. J. Dennis, Edward
Dyson, D. M. Ross, Archibald Strong, Louis
Esson, Bartlett Adamson, Randolph Bedford,
Mary Gilmore, Zora Cross, M. Forrest, Nora
McAuliffe, Dora Wilcox, Dulcie Deamer,
Clarice Crosbie, Marie Pitt and a large num-
ber of others can hardly be regarded as of
consequence. All the rejected ones may com-
fort themselves with the thought that they
are beyond the pale of the new Methodism
and in the very good company of the outcast
Lake poets.
DAVID McKEE WRICHT.
Modern Belief
Julian Huxley is the grandson of “Darwin’s
Bulldog,” and has been making a great name
for himself by his studies of bird-life. In a
world oppressed by the nonsense of Papini
it is refreshing to come across someone who
is determined to bind himself to the chariot-
wheels of objective truth, as evidenced by
scientific 'discovery; and in this if in nothing
else Julian is a true chip of the old block.
T. 11. Huxley was one of the greatest masters
of English who ever lived, with a singularly
pellucid and witty style—just the style suited
to ram the truths of Darwinism down the
throats of a saintly and perverse generation.
Things are easier for Julian; the battle of
evolution has been fought and won, and,
except for a few howling dervishes, I do not
suppose that there is a single educated man
in the world who doubts the truth of evolu-
tion, even though there may be differences of
opinion as to the exact manner in which it
works. And though in America some Houses
of Legislature have been silly enough to pass
Acts apparently forbidding the process, I do
not suppose that these will make a great deal
of difference; in spite of the wrath of Ameri-
can dervishes Natural Selection will continue
to select, just as the sea continued to wet
the feet of sanguine King Canute. The mor-
dant style that was necessary for grand-pore
Huxley would be out of place in Julian Hux-
ley. Whatever polemics may lie in the
Essays of a Biologist (Chatto and Windus)
are not thrust in the forefront; they are
courteous, learned and charmingly written,
with a grave irony that is rather remarkable
in a man who is hardly yet in middle age.
Early in the Tertiary period we begin to
see evidence of mind in the fossil animals;
and this has increased until we arrive at the
present or “Quaternary” period, which lias
even been known as the “Psychozoic” age; the
“Age of Intellect.” The problem now before
the world is what direction shall Natural
Selection take? The evolution of the great
brain of man. with its imperious wit, has
already altered Natural Selection. How can
Nature have a chance when that interfering
creature is about whom she produced in a
Frankenstein aberration? Natural Selec-
tion is almost becoming human selection, and
it would now seem that what it is acting
upon is the world of human ideas rather than
the world of natural bodies. Nationalism
has become more of a religion than Chris-
tianity ; and it, too, is spreading the seeds of
its own destruction in the Hague Court and
the League of Nations. It all reminds one
of T. H. Huxley when everybody was shout-
ing “crass materialist” at him. He wrote:
“I think if I were to describe myself as any-
thing I should say that I am an Idealist,”
and that was probably true. In spite of
“The Gentleman with a Duster,” and his non-
sense, modern biological science is becoming
more idealistic every day, even though it is
founded on the sure foundation, not of
Plato, but of Charles Darwin.
There is a very delightful little essay on birds.
“No brain, only soul,” is how Julian Huxley
sums up the mind of a bird, that most charm-
ing, emotional and beautiful of all living
creatures. “Soul,” of course, does not mean
“immortal soul,” but capacity for emotion.
In this essay we see traces of that inimitable
lightness that made the style of his grand-
father so attractive.
It is in the essay on “Rationalism and the
Idea of God” that we come to the real beliefs
of modern scientific men; and they will be
found quite different from the beliefs that
dervishes of the local type have attributed to
Science. Frankly, no educated man can
believe in a Personal God. If he says he
believes it. then probably he is deceiving him-
self. But Science, willing to find God if
He is to be found, has found that in all mat-
ter there is life, or at least the possibility
of life; and has proved', the fact, as
the idea of God could never be proved, by
objective evidence such as is alone acceptable
to scientific men. Man, in forming God after
his own image, is only projecting his own
intellect into the unknown; to some of us it
rather seems as if each man were forming
in his own mind a God after his own heart,
the projection of an idealised being that re-
sembles himself as he thinks he should have
been. Huxley does not go so far as this,
though he is quite sure about the former pro-
jection. Morals and all human qualities arc
the result of evolution, and there is neither
evidence nor need for the postulate of divine
origin. Mnn is a being apart in. the world ,
there is nothing else like him; in no other
animal is his soul —or mind, if you object to
that metaphysical term —open to the infinite
by such a flood of illumination from liis sense-
organs combined with the power of his brain;
by speech, which bestows upon him the gift
of communicating with his fellows and form-
ing tradition; by writing, which gives nun
the power of handing down exact knowledge
from generation to generation. But man
dwells in a universe of matter in which reside
vast hidden forces, how vast modern science
is only beginning to reveal, and to modern
science God is the summation of these forces.
That, of course, is Pantheism. God and the
Universe are the same thing. As for Crea-
tion, we know nothing; we can only sur-
mise, in the belief that matter has always
been the same, governed by. the same physi-
cal laws and electrons as it is to-day. In
the beginning was a whirl of ions, infinite
in extent though not infinite in time, for it
must have had a beginning. Slowly, in the
course of vast ages, these ions settled down
in their systems with electrons, to form mat-
ter ; in time, after countless aeons, this matter
evolved until it reached the stage of colloids;
between a colloid and the lowest form of life
there is but a span ; that span was bridged,
and there w r as life in the universe. There is
no evidence to show whence the ions came,
or how the span was bridged; we do not
know. Thus all things are electricity.
Many have bogged at the problem of evil:
why is there hunger and want and war in the
world? Evolution does not always progress
in the direction that would seem desirable to
man. Sometimes it actually seems to re-
gress ; creatures which begin life as free-
swimming animals end it fixed to a. rock.
Similarly, evil appears to be a regression of
evolution; man, beginning as a joyous “free-
swimming” social animal, ends by cutting
throats. But Darwin himself pointed out
that Natural Selection did not imply survival
in man by the aid of war; it was the utter
misapprehension of Darwinism in Germany
that led to the late trouble. Man, being the
highest of animals, has the power of learning
rapidly by experience; we are in process of
learning to-day. We have, in propria per-
sona, learnt what war means: and quite pos-
sibly the latest war may be the last.
Mr. Huxley is not only the grandson of
the greatest of expositors: he is the nephew
of Mrs. Humphry Ward, who. though a
novelist of considerable power, was not re-
markable for humor or the extreme clarity
of her writing. Possibly it may be that in
the conjunction of such families we may find
the explanation of a certain ponderousness in
his style. But his book is an exceedingly
good book, which everybody should read if
he desires to be well up in the best modern
thought.
C. McL.
A Plea for the Mongrel
The keynote of Poultney Bigelow’s Japan
end Her Colonics (Edward Arnold) is struck
aft he" end of chapter xii:—
I would gladly s6nd a wedding present , for every,
marriage that bound more closely the blood brother-
hood of East and West.
Mr. Bigelow is probably as patriotic as any
elderly Tory can be who experiences a sensa-
tion of nausea every time he thinks of “mob
rule disguised as democracy,” and who yearns
to see Japan’s system of permanent military
autocrats substituted for the U.S.A.’s periodi-
cally-elected governors. However, the task
in hand debars him from viewing his coun-
try and its republican institutions with an
eye of pride. He has heard uninformed per-
sons question the morality of the Japanese.
Tourists have returned to the U.S. with un-
pleasant stories about cities in which large
quarters are entirely dedicated to prostitu-
tion of a particularly cynical description.
These, it appears, are ignorant libels.
Japan “is a country of happy and virtuous
homes.” When a Japanese gentleman visits
the U.S. he “is disgusted by the porno-
graphic nature of much that passes for enter-
tainment —on the stage, in our movies,
in our periodicals and, more still, in our
cabarets or dancing-academies.” As to the
Geishas: —
What the private morals of the Geisha may be
concern me no more than the home life of New
York bachelor girls. Of this, however, you may be
sure, that the Geisha is above all else an artiste
professionally and very much of a lady, and must
not be confounded with common women... .God
made the Geishas clever and courteous and willowy
and melodious —what wonder then that He made
man to fall in love with them and to . gown them
handsomely and to raise them on pinnacles for
adoration !
Later he tells of a Formosan Geisha, or
“sing-song girl,” who “filled my glass—and
she said she would return with me to the
Hudson River.” It would bo interesting, in
estimating the relative morality of Geishas
and New York bachelor girls, to know if
one of the latter had ever made a similar
proposal to him.
Envious members of the colonising races,
confounded by Japan’s success in winning
the love of her new subjects in Korea, For-
mosa and elsewhere, have put it about that
her methods with these fortunate folks are
harsh. There have actually been statements
in responsible newspapers about massacres of
unarmed natives by the troops in occupation.
Only the other day some hundreds of Koreans
were said to have been slaughtered in stricken
Tokyo for no other crime than that of being
Koreans. These reports, Mr. Bigelow assures
us, are absurd. The Japanese treat their
burden of savagery on humane and enlight-
ened lines —or, anyhow, with more Chris-
tian consideration than the Yankee extends
to his burden :
A Christian colonising people would say “No good
Indian but a dead Indian.” Not so the political
pathologist of Japan. He knows that those savages
err through superstition and the memory of past
wrongs; that thev are brave and intelligent; that
however implacable the present generation may be,
the next promises well.
The manners of the Japanese are as
superior as their morals: —
Never have I seen a Japanese look unkindly at
an umpire—far less question his decision. Many
games have I watched where American college boys
and Japanese were hotly tied in a championship
match and where the onlookers were equally divided
nationally. Never do I hope to see chivalrous
courtesy better exemplified than by the Japanese
contestants and their backers. If the American
slipped or missed, no howl of delight arose from the
Nippon side —on the contrary, a murmur of sym-
pathy. And so I pray for 10,000 missionaries from
Japan—merely to teach us how to behave —let them
be merely manner-missionaries !
What is at the back of all this fulsome adula-
tion and invidious comparison? The answer
may be found in a book by two Japanese
professors in American universities which
was reviewed on this page last year. Its
object was to show that America's alien
exclusion laws were absurd as applied to
Japanese, inasmuch as there is no real ethno-
logical difference between the two races. The
professors demanded more than full citizen
rights for all Japanese already settled in the
U.S.A.: they claimed immigration rights,
and that the national fibre and culture had
much to gain from intermarriage with Japan-
ese immigrants. Such is the policy in whose
interests Poultney Bigelow appears as the
willing propagandist. He started no doubt
with preconceived views. American Conser-
vatism, like our own, draws no color line
unless the racial purity of its own class is
menaced. But the Japanese authorities, evi-
dently, spared no pains to stimulate his en-
thusiasms. In Japan’s northernmost colony
he sat dowm “in a remote forest” to a meal
“served with a completeness and elegance
that could have hardly been surpassed at
Yama Farms, of New York, or the Chapon
Fin, of Bordeaux.” The Governor-General
of the*island gave a gala dinner in his honor
for the purpose of which “a special chef and
steward had been sent on from Tokyo,” and
at which “such Lamotte and La Rose cham-
pagne was opened that even Paris could have
provided none more fragrant.” Even on the
little thousand-ton steamer that bore him
from one island to another he found a dinner
of ten courses and an early breakfast of
seven—all for his special delectation. Men
may be bribed in many ways—by money, by
titles, and, above all, by flattery. The astute
Japanese applied the third method to Mr.
Bigelow, and to an extent they have been
repaid. The author of “Japan and Her
Colonies” protests a good deal too much, but,
as in all his works, the writing is fluent and
lively, and many will read his book for its
interest who abominate the doctrines it pro-
pounds.
J. B. D.
Lord Alfred Douglas
When the last trump sounds and a trem-
bling humanity steps before the bar of Judg-
ment, one of the most subtle psychological
problems, baffling to the human mind, will
be the analysis of the character of Alfred
Douglas. Will he stand amongst the sheep
or the goats? The problem is too delicate —
indeed, impossible—to deal with here. It
is, however, permissible to write of this
strange, erratic genius—for genius he is—
with a freedom pardoned by a certain inti-
macy.
It was during the early days of his editor-
ship of Plain English that, as a free-lance
journalist, eager to achieve fame, I “swam
into the ken” of this brilliant son of a
famous father. I had sent him an article.
A week later he wrote asking me to lunch
at the Holborn Restaurant. There was a
certain quaintness about the lunch, I remcm-
ber. Conan Doyle had just dined a great
company of spiritualists, nearly all tne
glasses had been used, and we were reduced
to drinking beer out of champagne glasses.
I have forgotten what sort of food we ate.
I remember Douglas talking like a conver-
sational machine-gun; he delivered a pan-
egyric on the gastronomic virtues ot oysters
(we ate two dozen apiece), and m jerky
sentences discoursed on the mission ot 1 lain
English. Despite a certain wariness, per-
haps a little meanness, the man fascinated ,
there was a something which subtly attracted.
Of medium height, thick-set, lie looked like
a stockbroker with a declining clientele.
Lines of failure, bitterness and sorrow were
stamped on his features. Only a certain
glow, like smothered fire in his eyes—deep
brown, woman’s eyes—revealed the genius
within him. His hands, thin and nervous,
were the hands of a poet. I recall lum
vividly as he sat in the noisy, bustling restau-
rant. He talked with extraordinary fluency.
Food, politicians (how he loathed most ot
them!), religion (for recently he had be-
come an ardent Catholic, given to sending
telegrams to the Pope), and the alleged rot-
tenness of the Public School system were
themes touched on. He discussed religion
with all the ardor and subtlety of a Jesuit,
and with all the yearning of a Dominican
spoke of the “conversion” of England. Appa-
rently the salvation of England lay in the
importation of the Pope and the sacking ot
his Grace of Canterbury. Douglas is fana-
tically sincere in his new faith. I am con-
vinced of that. Visiting Westminster Cathe-
dral to hear Palestrina, I have seen him
kneeling in a corner of the great church with
all the rapt devotion of a monk.
After lunch we strolled back to the office
of Plain English. It was a delightful
place ; water-colors hung on the walls, flow-
ers graced a couple of Chippendale tables.
I was introduced to Mr. Pym, sub-editor
and Sinn Feiner, a tall, bearded man with
melancholy eyes. He talked like an Irish
Hamlet brooding on the wrongs of his native
land. Douglas kept up a running fire of
fierce commentary. He spoke with biting
scorn of Lord Nortlicliffe, and expressed con-
tempt for the policy of Mr. Montagu, then
Secretary for India. It was entertaining
for a while, then irritating; finally it became
downright wearisome. It was so childish ;
there was nothing remotely constructive in
his political or social outlook.
I saw him later in the Old Bailey. He
reminded me there of a modern Don Quixote.
Indeed, to me now he is a qiieer blend of
Caliban, Ariel. Machiavelli, Don Quixote and
Pierrot. What effect six months’ imprison-
ment will have on him it is impossible to say.
Even a new version of “De Profundis” may
result.
P.S. —That article I first mentioned duly
appeared in print. But Alfred Douglas for-
got to pay me for it. And that was rather
characteristic, too.

The Attainment of an'ldeal
in Paige 6-70
THE culmination of years of endeavor —the
ideal of a lifetime in engineering—is embodied
in the new Paige 6-70 J
Since 1909, the Paige engineers have been
steadily and surely progressing toward this goal,
that is, to perfect a motor car such as the new
model 6-70. The Paige Motor Car Company have
been builders of fine motor cars for years, altho
their engineers* idea of a perfect motor car has
never been realized until the creation of the
present model.
There is no detail too small to be important. This
applies to the developing of the immense power with
little or no friction and the true balance of all run-
ning gear as related to the engine. The comfort and
luxury of most excellent upholstery of patent finish
leather, the exact shaping of the seats, the roomy
tonneau, and the beauty of design and finish of
this ideal Paige instantly place it in the class of the
finer motor cars of the world.
Standard equipment of all Paige Models includes: 6 cord tyres, tubes,
rims. Spares mounted one each side with lock and tyre cover,
meter Double bar spring bumpers front and rear. Luggag* carrier.
Combination back and stop light. Automatic windscreen cleaner. Alu-
minium kick plates. Petrol gauge on dash. Eight day Waltham clock.
Electric cigar lighter. Green glass sunshade. Rear view mirror, bnubbers

Dorothy’s Dilemma.
(By “PHLOX.”)
“ T\T HY ever don’t you bring him up
V V to the scratch, Dorothy?”
•'Oh, aunt, how can you talk
like that?”
“Well, my dear, one must be practical
these days. You’re the eldest of the family,
and you’ve never yet been engaged, iheie s
May and Edna married and Babs engaged,
and now that you have a nice man paying
you attention, you don’t do your part to-
wards leading up to a proposal. Don’t you
care for Jack Hutton?’
"Yes, aunt. I’m just crazy about him.
But I can't ask him to marry me.”
“All the same, I do think you might give
him a little more encouragement. But who
knows? The spirit may move him to propose
at the dinner-dance at the W entwortli to-
morrow night. You must look your best,
Dorothy.”
"I only wish I was as lovely us Mrs.
Merton.” ,
“Mrs. Merton is very beautiful, but I don t
know that she is the best companion for a
girl. I hear that all young men are m
love with her. She’ll fascinate Jack Hutton,
if you’re not careful. They say she was
the cause of Mary Fletcher’s engagement
being broken off.” ,
“Mere idle gossip, aunt. A woman can t
help being fascinating.”
The Wentworth Cafe was all gaiety and
brightness; the softly-shaded lights throw-
ing a glamor over everything, In the
beginning of the evening, Dorothy had en-
joyed herself; now she felt that the sun
would never shine again for her. Jack
Hutton had taken Mrs. Merton into the
palm court, and appeared to be talking earn-
estly to her. After all, her aunt was right.
She was dangerous.
Before long, however, Mrs. Merton and
Jack Hutton returned to the ballroom. Jack
made for Dorothy, and proposed that he
should take her into the palm couit and
show her the gold fish. Before she knew
where she was, Jack had taken her arm
and led her out.
With faltering voice he told her the old,
old tale, and he added, “If it hadn’t been
for Mrs. Merton, I would never have sum-
moned up the courage to ask you. She said
that you are the sweetest girl she knows,
and that it would be a lucky man who got
you.” " , .
They stayed in the palm court a long
while, talking as if the world existed only
for themselves. When Jack led her back
to the room she walked as if on air.
Next day Dorothy mused on all that had
happened. How wonderful it had been ! She
was so happy. There was, however, one
thing that troubled her and marred her
otherwise complete happiness. But she
could not confide in her aunt or her sisters:
they would only laugh. Happy thought—
Mrs. Merton would understand. She would
talk things over with her. . .
Mrs. Merton was in, in the maid said, and
would she mind stepping into her bedroom,
where she was just taking it easy and
resting ?
Dorothy talked long of her engagement.
Then, after some hesitation, she mentioned
to Mrs. Merton that she wore false hair
over her ears, and she had always heard
that men detested women assisting nature
in that way. Jack would probably despise
her for it.' “But what am I to do?” she
exclaimed with a sigh. “My hair is so thin
and scraggy that it would be impossible to
dress it in the fashion without using some
false hair. If I only had your hair, Mrs.
Merton! How glorious it looks falling
down!”
“My dear, any healthy woman can have
good hair by looking after it.”
“I’m quite sure I would go to any trouble
if I thought I should ever have hair like
yours.”
“But you don’t need to go to a great deal
of trouble. All I do to keep mine luxuriant
and glossy is to shampoo it regularly with
Stallax. Usually, too, at the change of the
seasons I make a simple tonic at home. To
make the tonic I get from the chemist a
package of pure boranium, and mix it witn
half a pint of bay rum. I rub it well into
the scalp night and morning for a week or
two. You can’t beat boranium for restoring-
dull and lifeless hair, and making healthy
hair more beautiful.”
“Will the stallax shampoo and the bora-
fliurn tonic make my hair thick enough to
do without ear muffs?”
“Certainly, my dear. After using the
stallax shampoo and boranium a few months
your hair will be beautifully thick and
glossy. You won’t need any ear muffs then.”
“Please forgive me, Mrs. Merton, if I ask
what that cream is that you are rubbing into
your face?”
“It’s mercolized wax, but I suppose you
know what wonderful stuff it is.”
“Indeed, I don’t.”
“Then I’d advise you to get a tin at once.
It’s the best possible cream for the com-
plexion, because it imperceptibly removes the
old, worn-out skin, and reveals the baby skin
underneath.”
“But does the young skin last?”
“Yes, if you use the. wax, regularly. You
know that in time the sun and wind dis-
color the skin, and you need to periodically
remove the discoloration.”
“Oh, -it’s after six—l must be going. You
have been very helpful to me, dear Mrs.
Merton. But not a word, please, to my
people. I can’t thank you enough for help-
ing me out of my dilemma.” — Advt.

The day was all yellow and blue,
With little pink tippets of pearl,
As soft as the hyacinth hue
In the eyes of a babykin girl.
Dawn-red, through the lace of a tree,
A parrot was shining his wing;
Against the blue s'ky I could see
All the colors the bird couldn’t sing.
The green and the blue that he wore,
The pink and the rose and the grey—
These all lie might fling me and more
Could he sing me a song for the day.

In emerald flight, jerky yet strong.

With tossing plumes go up the hill ;
All Heaven becomes one billowing sail
The roaring west must fill.
Woe to the vanquished! Hold, brave roof!
There comes a scourge of lashing ram.
The window glass is battle-proof,
Though still the eaves complain.
One rending crash. A great tree falls;
Its limbs are splintered in their doom.
Be glad for stout, resisting walls
About a quiet room !
The loud trees screaming in the gale

The Tryst of Time.
Beside the fire enwrapt in reverie,
Bathed in the ruddy glow,
Alone I staved and like a devotee
Watched the rich flames burn low.
Dreaming, I heard far music, sweet and old.
Sound on the perfumed air;
And saw strange figures, men of Titan mould,
Women benignly fair.
Myself I seemed one of a mighty throng
In some vast Hall of State,
And, moving soft the glittering floor along,
I knew my pilot, Tate.
Thus was I led to where you stood alone
Within an alcoved space;
The thought of all the sorrows Dove Had
known
Died when I saw your face!
You knew me. coming back across the years,
No little word we spoke;
But all the doubting, all the foolish fears,
Took flight —and joy awoke.
Ah i Since we met and loved what centuries
Had passed in sun and shade;
Upon ivliat dark, what cold and trackless
seas
Our souls had journey made!
Yet always mine had searched for yours
through time
And all the bounds of earth,
Searched every land and every changing
clime,
In every new rebirth.
To meet you thus again and as of old
Find shelter in your arms!
How safe I felt —a stray within the fold—
Secure from all alarms.
And then she came, that cold and stately one,
Who stood within the door,
Where, seeing her, I knew the hour was
done,
As it had been before.
Bereft, forlorn, dark Fate remained to me;
She led me whence I came
To that low fire where, wrapt in reverie,
I watched the dying flame.

HOW CAN AUSTRALIA BE SAVED?
Agriculture on die Australian mainland
means wheat, except in the tropics. Of every
1000 cultivated acres there are, in the Can-
berra Territory, 8914 under wheat and hay;
in N. S. Wales, 8871; in Westralia, 8792;
in S. Australia, 8711; and in Victoria, 8323.
One reason is that the growing of this grain
can he made practically a one-man
job—the job of one long-hour and often
sweated and ill-paid piece-worker; therefore
it doesn’t come to grief over the basic wage
and strikes and union interference. Another
reason is that it affords the most popular
excuse of the moment for big loans, which
are the favorite substitute for work and
responsibility. Also it is an excuse for a
noisy war against large estates, and even
very medium ones, and against the sheep
industry—the only “primary” industry the
country possesses which brings heaps of
money from abroad and at the same time
pays high wages and very high railway
rates, and doesn’t employ child labor. More
wheat-growing means, of course, more grow-
ing for export, with the handicaps of inferior
soil and record sea distances (using other
people’s expensive ships) to the principal
markets. The other day sundry Canadian
farmers came here to spy out the land, saying
that the bottom had fallen out of agriculture
both in the United States (the world’s great-
est wheat-raiser) and in their own Dominion
(the fourth greatest). Montreal and New
York may be 8000 miles nearer the British
market than Australia’s central port of
Adelaide, but apparently they are still too
remote. This is especially likely now that
the low-wage Russian, whose port of Odessa
is 9000 miles nearer to England than Adel-
aide, has come on to the British market on a
large scale again after some nine years’
absence. It was reckoned, at latest advices,
that European Russia is the second oiggest
wheat-furnisher on earth (the Common-
wealth has been from eighth to fourteenth),
and it was when this great competitor’s re-
turn seemed imminent that the United
States Department which looks after these
matters implored the U.S. farmer not to be
an impossible ass, but to reduce his wheat
acreage by one-fifth, even if some of him had
to leave the land and take to making “tin
Lizzies” to sell to the borrowing Australian.
One of the Canadians who hope to find
this a land of promise alleged, as one element
of a hopeless situation in his own bear-
haunted land, that the local Private Enter-
prise railway, which has to pay its way, hav-
ing no taxpayer to fall back upon, charged
him seven cents (say 34d.) freight per bushel
for a 500-mile journey. If 40 bushels are
considered a ton, that means 11s. Bd.; and if
the unfortunate agriculturist has come here
for, relief he may be harrowed to learn that the
lowest average charge per ton of anything
for 500 miles on Australia’s State railways
is, or was in 1922, 18s. 5d.. the separate
rates varying from 12s. 4d. in N.S.W. to
30s. 3d. in Queensland. This extra land
freight, which is apparently insufficient to
make the systems pay, with the extra sea
freights and the extra droughts added,
doesn’t hold out much promise for an Aus-
tralian wheat boom, when Canada and the
U.S. are losing heart. Yet Premier Mit-
chell of Westralia is raising a 44-million
loan, of which half is to be devoted to
putting farmers on the land to pursue the
invariable vegetable. When Private Enter-
prise beckons people on the land its general
practice is to sell them farms or farmlets at
several times their value and make wealth
out of the deal; but Governments, especially
wheat-crank Governments, have taken to buy-
ing with much loan money people to take the
farms or farmlets off their hands. This artificial
settlement is additional to the common or
garden form of settlement which is going on
all the time, yet 30 acres of loan selection
and 10 acres of plain selection don’t seem,
when added together, to produce quite one
acre of new cultivation. An increase of
288,000 acres in 1921-22 wasn’t much con-
sidering all the land resumptions and immi-
gration expenditure, and, above all things, the
£48,000,000 of new State debt. In propor-
tion to population there were more acres
under crop in 1914 than in 1922, the drop
being from 3014 to 2787 per 1000 inhabitants.
The British elections burst for an indefinite
period any dream of preference over the
Yankee and the Argentine and the Bolshevik,
and brought about the prospect of a Govern-
ment which may 'really prefer the Bolshevik.
But long before that event it was obviously
time to scrap the delusion that there is money
in being Gibeonite-in-ordinary or Yegetable-
John-at-large to a very remote nation that
has very little use for us.
* * * *
Australia’s promise lies in its factories
and its workshops, where droughts don’t
count and rabbits cease from troubling. There
should be hope for the man on the land in
the cotton industry,, for it is an article of
which the world is short instead of being a
drug in the market, and there is an unsatis-
fied local demand for cotton. But even
cotton is leaning up heavily against a Gov-
ernment guarantee, and the State may fall in
just as N.S.W. did when its Dooley Cabinet
“revived” wheat-growing with a promise of
2s. 6d. extra per bushel, and paid nothing, and
left its successors to find the money. Yet even
cotton-growing wants cotton factories to help
it along. “Secondary industry,” as it is the
foolish habit to call it, has these advantages
among others:—
It doesn’t involve big loans, big debts, huge
interest bills, vast land-resumption swindles, and the
bellowing of politicians on the housetops.
It doesn't supply an excuse for the building of loan
railways, which promptly proceed to lose hundreds
of pounds per mile per annum, and which lead
nowhere save to. a dead end, in all manner of
waste places where even primitive agriculture is
pretty hopeless.
It doesn’t hold up the State to take its output
at a high fixed price, or ask it to promise, out of
the Treasury, an extra half-crown a 3 7 ard on the
doth or an extra 2s. 6d. a pair on the boots.
It pays the highest wages and railway charges,
while agriculture pays the lowest. It yields the
railways a profit,- while wheat supplies only a loss.
Such attempts as are made to foster “secondary
industry’’ lead to revenue (£21,731,210 was the
amount in one year), while the attempts to foster
“primary industry” lead chiefly to perdition.
It saves about 22,000 miles of sea freight, which
is something. If a bushel of wheat is sold to the
man who makes the farmer’s cotton shirt here in-
stead of to a similar person in England, 11,000
miles of haulage ia saved each way.
It can be made a means of promoting immigra-
tion just as well as any land swindle or boom ever
invented—immigration of skilled artisans, of'whom
Britain has plenty to spare, instead of agriculturists,
of whom it has only a small, dispirited lot.
Also there is a very great local demand to be
met, and a very big market in which preference
can be assured against Bolshevik competition and
every other sort.
* * * *
“Secondary industry” lias had to contend
with many drawbacks, of which may be
mentioned the decay of apprenticeship, the
foreign loan policy which lends encourage-
ment to importation, the big city congestion
policy which has systematically aimed
at the destruction of small towns and small-
town industries, the systematic efforts of a
noisy and unpleasant, class of conspirators
to destroy all secondary industry as part of
the “capitalistic evil,” insufficient Protection,
also too much going slow, to say nothing of
inefficient employers and complicated arbitra-
tion methods which are one-half delay and
one-half costs. Yet it is a live thing where
many others are pretty dead. In 1921-22
manufacturing (which means not the gross
value of factory output but merely the value
added in the factories to the raw materials
used) gave a far bigger return than any of
the other five branches of production—agri-
cultural, pastoral, mining, forestry and fish-
ing (which are curiously bracketed to-
gether), and the cow, hen and bee business.
Manufacturing showed a solid increase of
over £11,000,000 in the amount of wealth pro-
duced, while the other five branches, especi-
ally agriculture, slumped badly, the aggre-
gate slump being £58,000.000. And it fur-
nishes employment to a larger and larger
proportion of the population, except in
Queensland, where Theodore reigns, and
in Westralia, where Mitchele rules. The
figures (which the Statistician calculates on
the mean population of each year) are as
follows:
Factory W orkers per 10,000 Mean Population.
1914. 1921-22. Increase.
Victoria . . . . 832 934 102
New South Wales . . 626 699 73
Tasmania .. .. 450 475 25
S. Australia . . 611 620 9
Decrease.
Westralia . . 545 544 1
Queensland .. . . 641 553 88
Increase.
Commonwealth ..674 719 45
The moral is that factory industry is the
thing best worth pursuing—in our present
circumstances, at any rate —and that the
State which goes in most strenuously for big
loans, railway-building jamborees and land-
settlement bubbles most surely misses the
’bus.
MODERN TIMES AND MEDIAEVAL
UNIVERSITIES.
Pbofessok Ray Lankester observed re-
cently that the modern British university is
“out of touch with the life of the period.’’
This brilliant man is entitled to dogmatise
on the subject: he has been closely asso-
ciated with the Empire’s great universities
—and notably Oxford and Cambridge—for
nearly 60 years. These ancient institutions,
whose principal colleges were founded in an
age when the passion for learning was at its
height in England, gradually changed their
character till, by the beginning of the 19tli
century, they had become places to which
young men of fashion repaired in the same
spirit as they made the Grand Tour or
bought commissions in the Guards. That,
in the essentials, despite Rhodes and other
scholarships, is what they are to-day. The
historic Oxford Clubs —Vincent’s, the Grid,
the Bullingdon—-are not thrown open to the
youths who excel in science or the arts : they
are reserved for masters of rowing or cricket,
for millionaires and for peers. The social
exigencies are such that a gregarious young
man who has proved acceptable to the large
numbers of undergraduates who are there
chiefly to form friendships in an enjoyable
way, finds it extremely hard to work. He
may play cricket, football, tennis and golf,
row, hunt, go racing, do a certain amount
of gambling, belong to a wine club and
visit others as a guest, join the O.U.D.C.
and patronise the theatre. In the circum-
stances it is not surprising that many are
driven to do the modest amount of reading
requisite to achieve the “pass” which is all
they aspire to in the vacations. Term time
at a fashionable British university of to-
day is far too strenuous on the sporting and
Social sides to admit of concentrated study
except in the case of the somewhat despised
minority, who, heedless of the cricketing honor
or rowing repute alike of their colleges and
of the ’varsity itself, decide to toil, no matter
how much their colleagues may play. It is
a modified form of this anomalous system
which has been imported to Australia, and
the results are beginning to be seen in vast
crops of professional men -without any real
culture, and in the appearance of a flashy
and illiterate press to serve the nation’s new
mental needs.
Of N. S. Wales, for example, it may
fairly be said that one-half of the State’s
knowledge-seekets in the higher reaches of
learning are being educated in the wrong
way, while the othesrs are being denied the
opportunity of education altogether. A privi-
leged few are able to go to Sydney Univer-
sity, which offers all the disadvantages of
the semi-monastic Oxford regime with few
of its benefits. At Oxford particular atten-
tion is pajjd to the morals of the under-
graduate at a period in the latter’s life when
close supervision is advisable in his physical
even more than in his spiritual interests.
At the Sydney institution undergraduates
may consort with Rahab practically to any
extent they please. For many of those who
come from the country there is neither the
engrossing collegiate and inter-collegiate
social life which the older British univer-
sities offer, nor the home life which may be
enjoyed by a Londoner attending London
University, and by young men in America
and Germany whose universities lie at their
parents’ doors. In the intervals of lectures
and work the Sydney undergrad is tempted
to taste the delights of a city which is in-
comparably more dangerous than any of the
quiet towns in which the old-world seats of
learning are to be found. If the welfare of
the students were a first consideration with
the authorities, the State’s chief symbol of
culture would be almost anywdiere but in a
great seaport which is notoriously reeking
with venereal disease, pony-racing and other
degenerative influences. But in the first
place the politicians treat the university as
a lever in the vote-catching business of cen-
tralising as much population and expendi-
ture as possible in Sydney; and in the second
the ’varsity officials, from the Chancellor
downwards, are city men, attached to the
shores of Port Jackson by innumerable
family and club ties. The last reform they
are likely to consider in a serious spirit is
the salutary one of transferring their Univer-
sity from its present costly and unsuitable
surroundings to a site like the admirable
one chosen for the R. M. College, or to Port
Stephens, which, as an educational centre,
rivals Jervis Bay.
* * * *
In the circumstances those who are call-
ing for an alternative form of University de-
centralisation have a distinct claim to be
heard. In many of the larger N. S. Wales
towns—Armidale, Bathurst, Newcastle, etc.
—devoted teachers exist who are hungering
to co-operate with Sydney in the interests of
would-be students who are not in a position
to leave their homes for three or four years
at a time. The committee of the Bathurst
University Extension League, for example,
contains such ripe scholars as F. B.
Guthrie, 8.A., B.Sc.; Rev. Wallace
Deane, M.A., the president of St. Stanislaus’
College; and R. C. Taylor, B.A. These
gentlemen are more than ready to lecture
to their fellow-citizens on any syllabus that
may be supplied by Sydney University
Senate. The inauguration of such a scheme
could do nothing but good. It would help
materially to make our universities what
the historic English ones once were—centres
of competitive learning. The type of young
man who took a university course in his
own town would tend—as many American
cities have found, and as some Queensland
towns are finding—to be a student first and
a sporting and social success a long way
afterwards. The type of lecturer who volum
teered to serve him—often a clergyman of
the best class —would draw inspiration from
the knowledge that he was possibly saving
his young friend from worse things than
illiteracy. And between them, with due
attention to the details of the matter, they
might do much to substitute genuine culture
for the sorry affair which too often mas-
querades here in culture’s name. In S. M.
Herald F. G. Brown, 8.A., B.Sc., recently
made these grave charges:—
I have known a [Sydney] professor give two lectures
on a certain subject for which a whole text-book
is recommended. His examination questions were, of
course, confined to the work done in his two lectures.
Now how would a country student fare if he took
(lie same papers as the professor’s own pupils? In
tlie first place, he would probably have studied the
greater part of the text-book, and would know some-
thing about the subject. But, in the second place,
he might quite easily fail in the examination because
he had not done the particular points selected bv
the professor. But is he not the better student?
And who is it that really “tips” the paper—the
professor or the private coach? I am ashamed to
write it, but it. is an actual fact that a professor
will give his class strong hints about the inclusion
of certain questions in the forthcoming papers.
Under the reformed examination system
which would automatically appear with uni-
versity decentralisation, such dishonesty
could not live. No lecturer, in town or coun-
try, would know what questions were to be
put, much less have the right to put them
himself. The aspirants for degrees might
show a less uncanny precision in their
answers, but to succeed they would require a
far broader equipment of knowledge than is
possessed by most of those triumphs of the
"crammer's” art who shine in our examina-
tion rooms at present.
THE ARK OF THE GOVERNMENT.
On an earlier day of the month there was
launched from a Balmain yard a little vessel,
about 100 feet overall, intended for the use of
the Papuan Government. And she was named
the Lana-bada, signifying the south-east
trade wind, which, with her sister, the nor'-
wester, bulks so largely in Papuan naviga-
tion.
The peculiar conformation of New Guinea,
with its lofty backbone, has demanded that
inter-communication between Government
stations and other settlements shall be chiefly
by sea. As far as the freightage of supplies to
the Government posts is concerned, this is
imperative, for no large quantity of supplies
and stores could he carried over inland paths
save at ruinous expense. So it has come
about that the Papuan Government, like that
of British New Guinea before it, has always
had “an ark of its ain,” in the manner of the
Macdonalds of the Isles. This Ark of the
Government brings with it relief and leave
for overworked officials, supplies for the dis-
trict, some news of the outside world for
the men who have to stay on, and relief in
one way or another for the usual batch of
native notables who are at the moment en-
joying his Majesty’s hospitality in the gaol.
For with the Government ship comes the
Government Judge, who releases, remits to
gaol again, and—very occasionally—hangs,
for reasons not at all comprehended by his
patients, beyond that such things are “Gov-
ernment fashion.”
The new yacht is the fourth of her line,
and those who will have to travel in her
will hear with pleasure that she is to be
driven by Diesel engines, the oil-fuel of
wdiich is not very easily exploded—a matter
of some interest in a country of exceedingly
casual, ever-smoking native crews. Her im-
mediate predecessor, Merrie England 11., was
a petrol-driven craft, and came to the fiery
finish which awaits all her kind in Western
Pacific waters. The first of the line was
the Governor Blackall, a decrepit steamer
which was placed at the disposal of Sir
Peter Scratoitley, the first real Governor
of British New Guinea. Sir Peter was a
British General of the old school, and he
made his entry into Port Moresby
in all the scarlet and gold of his rank. But
the malarial mosquito has even less respect
for brass-hats than the A.l.F.’s Digger had,
and poor Sir Peter, after writing a few
expletive-filled reports on the miners who
were then, thronging into Papua in “the
first rush,” died of fever. A personal atten-
dant, who afterwards lived to found one of
the big Papuan trading firms, escorted the
General’s body to Cooktown, where it was
embalmed and properly coffined.
To Sir Peter succeeded Dr. Macgregor.
and to the Governor Blackall the first Merrie
England, whose name is as interwoven with
the story of Papua’s early development as
that of the doughty doctor himself. A beau-
tifully modelled fore and aft schooner, with
auxiliary steam, she had belonged to the
amiable Marquis of Aylesbury, the last of
the really blue-blooded blackguards. When
the ship came to Brisbane they took her
heavy spars out of her and fitted a 90-ton
lead keel, to save her composite hull from
the coral reefs which strew Papuan waters.
This keel saved her life a hundred times,
hut made her the liveliest craft in a beam
sea ever seen in those waters. Whenever
she anchored Macgregor himself would hie
him ashore, bag and baggage, and camp on dry
land, cannibals or no cannibals. And what
a ghost ship she was ! Men died untimely
on board her by the dozen, from fever and
dysentery and wounds, and in one case at
least by dynamite. Men sailed on her, full
of hope and ambition, who later died by
their own hands or by those of treacherous
savages. Others were tried for their lives
on board her; and the old “M.E.’s” cabin
more than once echoed the words of the
death sentence, passed on white men as well
as black. Her career told heavily on her
in the end, and when it was decided that
she had gone too far to be patched up again,
she resolved to die an honorable death. One
day she piled up on the reef outside Port
Moresby, through which she had slipped in
safety a thousand times. There her bones
are coral made, while her beauty and caprices
are remembered through the years by many
an old lover.
When a hired craft of commercial tradi-
tions had for a time carried out the Govern-
ment routine, there came another Merrie
England, a modern and a parvenu, with no


traditions And as has been said, she was
blo-wn up and burned with some loss of life,
owing to the Papuan’s propensity for light-
ing a cigarette while filling a petrol-tank.
Now after a series of makeshifts, comes
the new craft with a new name, given, per-
baps to change the old luck. But she will
,icver know the, spirit of adventure that
filled her most famous predecessor, or num-
ber among her passengers so many of the
Dishonorable Company of Gentlemen Adven-
turers Neither is she ever likely to become
a sacred tabernacle, a holy of holies, to
the Papuan native, as Macgregor’s ship
verily was There was, e.g., the case of the
Binandele sorcerer who gave the mission-
aries and Government of the Northern Divi-
sion much trouble by inventing a now reli-
gion—a sufficiently amazing thing among a
people who have ho semblance of a religion
of their own, other than the placating of
the spirits of the departed. The sooty St.
Paul’s gospel was a mixture of mission
Christianity, Papuan magic and the worship
of a mystic serpent, Baigona. To the

Cotton-growing in Queensland.
Dear Bulletin, —Mr. Crawford Vaughan,
in defence of his co. (B. 3/l/’24), describes
my comparison of American and Australian
costs as a sample of accountancy that is
“puerility itself”; and as the finances of
South Aus. slipped briskly astern at the aver-
age rate of a quarter of a million per annum
while he was Premier there, I accord him, I
hope, all the respect he has earned as an
authority on such matters. His admiration
of Theodorian “statesmanship” may explain
why South Australians gave him no further
chance to practise on them. I showed cotton-
seed as a debit against the grower’s account
because it is something he once owned. The
undertaking of the Queensland Government
is that “the advance is a minimum advance,
and any profit accruing after deducting the
cost of ginning and marketing will be divided,
pro rata, among those who supplied the seed
cotton.” It might be bad accountancy to
insist that the grower is as much concerned
in the disposal of the seed as he is in the
disposal of the lint; but I am unable to in-
terpret from the guarantee that when the
gins of Mr. Vaughan’s co. separate the seed
from the lint, they have any moral right to
separate it from the grower also. As this
happens, however, it appears reasonable to
at least show that the grower owned the
seed once. Mr. Vaughan complains that
my American costs are wrong. Since com-
piling them, my copy of the Oklahoma
Cotton Grower containing the ginning rates
for that State as fixed by commission has
come to hand. The rate per 1001 b. of seed-
cotton is 271 cents in the eastern, 15 in
the central and 324* in the western districts,
with a uniform 50 cents for “hollies” and
1.24d01. for bales and hoops. Worked out
at par this is how it looks for a bale of
5001b.:

5d.; so, as the present figures are worse
from Mr. Vaughan's point of view, the con-
spiracy to prove that his co. is getting well
paid for what it does for the grower appears
to have spread to America. On the subject
of ratooning. his team of experts who de-
nounce it all come from countries where
ratoon cannot be grown at all because of
frost, or where all cotton is grown under
irrigation, and the reason for wanting to
ratoon in Queensland— uncertainty of spring
and general rainfall —does not exist. I have
before me a letter —less than two months
old —from Dr. Andrew M. Soule, who was
Uncle Sam’s official delegate at the World
Cotton Congress in Rio de Janeiro, and he
is frank in his admission that he knows very
little about the ratoon. If he doesn’t know
much, how should they? The danger of
pests in ratoon cotton is held up before the
public gaze, hut as Queensland has had
ratoon for over 60 years and never had boll-
weevil, while America never had ratoon but
has had boll-weevil for some time, the argu-
ment looks ’ a bit upside down. I advocate
ratooning in Queensland because of a close
association with Queensland conditions ex-
tending over probably more years than Mr.
Vaughan’s months; and because I take the
trouble to analyse statistics of rain-
fall. Whether he knows it or not, Mr.
Vaughan’s co. is boosting the land schemes
of the Theodore Government in areas where
the average annual rainfall given in lumps
looks alluring, but analysed for the 120
months of 10 years looks like this: —
Months Months Proportion of
Above Below (Monthsßelow
Average. Average. Average.
Banana .. 47 73 SO.B
Camboon .. 40 80 66.6
Gayndah .. 47 73 60.8
Westwood . . 48 72 60.0
Average . . 45.1 74.9 62.4
T also advocate ratoon because there arc
only 10.1 acres of crop of all sorts per
10 Queenslanders against 36.7 acres for the
rest of Australia, and 38.4 in American
cotton-producing States, excluding cotton.
This circumstance is not accidental; .it has
never been any better, and oceans of cash
have been spent to keep it from getting
worse, and it is as good as it is only because
sugar forms 23 per cent, of the crop, and it
‘•an only be grown successfully by ratooning
1o the third and fourth generations, pest or no
pest. Accepting the principle that, people
produce that which pays them best, it looks
as if annual crops are shunned by the
Queenslander because they are apt to let him
down three years out of five, and even Mr.
Vaughan would not cling long to a job
where the pay envelope was absent that
often. I believe the future of Queensland
cotton will rival that of wool; and wool
would not be what it is to-day if we had com-
pelled sheepmen to breed merinos on the
coast. I believe that with every agreement,
subsidy, guarantee and covenant burned, and
all experts sent home, and cotton left to
Queenslanders who know Queensland, the
industry would establish itself. 1 am not
afraid of markets, so long as people con-
tinue to wear clothes and America to use
more and more of what the boll-weevil doesn’t
destroy; and as the guarantee of 5 Ad- per lb.
applies only to lint of l|in. staple, whereas
only about 15 per cent, of American cotton
is longer than an inch, the grower is not
getting much of a lift along, and could pro-
bably make better terms if left to himself. —

Britain “a Bankrupt Concern.”
The leader of the British Labor party scan-
dalised Conservatism last week by stating
that he and his followers were taking over a
bankrupt concern. The only answer seems
to have been a strange sort of plea in bar
—that, however bad things were, Freetrado
wasn’t to blame. If so, it is hard to place
the guilt. Recent visitors to Europe are
agreed that industry is booming in France,
Italy and several of the Balkan States which
were hard hit by the war. Germany is Hood-
ing the world with manufactured goods,
while her mercantile marine is rapidly get-
ting back to its pre-war dimensions. Britain
was in a much better position to forge ahead
when the fighting ended than any of these
countries. All her factories were standing,
her transport system, both home and foreign,
was unimpaired, and she had internal peace.
The three biggest industrial upheavals since
the Armistice —the engineering lock-out and
the dockers’ and boilermakers’ strikes —did
not do as much economic damage between
them, probably, as the smallest of Germany’s
many little revolutions. In luxury products
England owns a monopoly through which she
is able to take toll of the world. The
wealthy sportsman has to come to London
from tiie U.S.A., India, Canada, Italy, Spain,
etc., for the best guns and fishing tackle.
The exquisites of New York, Paris and a
hundred other cities take their wearing
apparel from Bond-street. The most expen-
sive motor-car in the world is English, and
all the world buys it. Add to such things
the necessaries which the British turn out
so much more efficiently than most people—
soap, cotton goods, etc. —and the products
of the great industries based, on coal and iron
in proximity, and it is evident that there
are still plenty of employment avenues for
British workers of the best class. An illu-
minating lesson in what has happened since
Britain threw over its war-time protective
policy, under which there was no unemp’ay-
ment. may be got from a study of the trade-
union figures of the last five years. When
the fighting ended the U.K. had 6J million
unionists ; to-day it has below 2| millions. The
difference is made up partly by the totally
unemployed, who number anything from one
to two millions, and partly by those who
are getting so little work that they cannot
keep good on the books. In the protected
countries of the Continent practically all the
employables in these classes have been
absorbed. Governments like that of France
have reasoned, sensibly enough, that their
first duty is to their own people, and that
with the creation of industries by tariff and
other encouragement the foreign debtor is
likelier to get his money in the long run
than if the country applied itself to wine-
making, agriculture and one or two other
picked industries, and out of the proceeds
tried to pay doles as well as debts. If
Britain had followed suit there is no reason
to believe she would be less solvent than at
present, while judging by every available
example, from the U.S.A. downwards, she
would at the worst have been saved the
ghastliest domestic problem that has ever
faced her.

A Soap Lord at Sea.
Viscount Leverhulme, who is a mighty
soap-boiler, is visiting these parts, bestowing
on them a great deal of fatherly or uncly
advice, and liis words went to the heart of
the Sydney Daily Sillygßapii, which in-
formed its reader (or readers) as follows:
Lord Leverhulme stated a truism when he said that
high tariffs raised freights and added to the cost of
living. Being a land of primary production it is
usual to send ships away from Australia loaded to
the Plimsoll mark. But when the same ships make
the return .journey they are half empty. In order to
make up the loss the shipping companies increase
the freights on the homeward journey, and as our
exports are chiefly primary produce, the man on the
land is ultimately obliged to bear the brunt of the
bill.
In the three years 1920-21 to 1922-23 the
Commonwealth imported nearly £21,000,000
worth more goods than it exported, and that
was fully £80.000,000 more than it had any
right to import, seeing that exports ought
to pay not only for imports but fordign in-
terest' bills as well. Still, either the soap-
boiler or the Sillygrash reckons, or they
both reckon, that this country should have
bought twice as much (and probably it would
have done so but for the wicked tariff), be-
cause the ships, which left here full, did the
return voyage “half-empty.” Who but a
monumental ignoramus could expect them to
do otherwise seeing that the goods sent from
here are “chiefly primary produce”? The
Commonwealth sold abroad £9,000,000 of
wheat and other grain last year, and it
bought in return £4,000,000 of silk and
£5,000,000 worth of woollen goods. But
though it sold nearly 1,000,000 tons of grain
it didn’t buy anything near 1,000,000 tons
of silks and woollens, and that is what the
peer and the paper are crying out about.
Likewise it is why they are patronising and
lavish with advice. The Australian exports
of lead were balanced by the imports of
jewellery, timepieces and fancy goods; but
the country didn’t import as many thousand
tons of jewellery as it exported tons of lead,
wherefore the return ship was far from full.
The Viscount and his obedient echo regard
this as proof of the great evils of Protection
—at any rate, the echo does, and it seems to
bo repeating the Viscount. Self-made men
are really a little trying at times, though, as
somebody else said, they save the Almighty a
lot of responsibility.
The Cant of Austin Chapman,
When politicians took charge of the move-
ment against the importation of an Italian
male chorus for Melba’s Grand Opera Co-
some highflown stuff got into print. Ibis
was Austin Chapman’s contribution :
I regret Melba's action in resolving to import an
Italian chorus. We have plenty of talent here
capable of holding its own against that of any other
country. I am quite in sympathy with the views of
the deputation from the Theatrical A.liance and will
convey them to Senator Pearce, the Minister con-
trolling this matter. 1 recognise that the members
of the deputation belong to an industry that is only
asking for a fair and square deal. 1 hope that the
matter will be settled amicably, as otherwise it
will lead to trouble. The Federal Government may
be trusted to see that the Australian male chorus
gets a fair deal.
Chapman’s zeal for Australian talent is only
in evidence when the responsibility for assist-
ing it may be thrown upon some other per-
son, and an advertisement obtained in the
process. As regards his own department his
record is a blank. In the capacity of Min-
ister for Trade and Customs, he is respon-
sible for the criminally inadequate duty of
lid. per foot on foreign cinematograph films.
He acquiesces in the pernicious foreign mon-
opoly of the Australian moving-picture
market, a monopoly due to the fact that a
•upy of an American film (advertised,
perhaps, as a million-dollar feature) can be
landed here, duty-paid, for £5O at the out-
side, whereas the first cost of a correspond-
ing Australian production would be at least
£5OOO. lie is content that £750,000 of good
Australian money should he exchanged every
year for bad American pictures—and some
of the money is doubtless dissipated in the
dope parties and shooting bees of Hollywood.
If the duty on films were made protective a
large slice of the £750,000 p.a. would remain
in Australia. In that case there would be
a great deal more wox-k for members of the
theatrical unions, and Australians with a
talent for picture-acting, such as Enid Ben-
nett, Sylvia Bremer, Elsie Wilson,
Clyde Cook, House Peters, “Snub” Pol-
lard, Rupert Julian and ever so many
more—wouldn’t be obliged to emigrate.
Again, the plastic-minded youngsters who
throng our cinema theatres would get healthier
instruction and entertainment than is
provided by the debauchees, morons, Huns,
ruffians, criminals and crime-exploiters who
infest the screen-“art” of America. But
Austin Chapman, though overcome with
emotion at the thought that 30 Italian opera-
singers may be engaged in Australia for a
few months, won’t lift a finger to assist an
industry in which at least a thousand Aus-
tralians might be permanently and usefully
employed.

Page and Some Perplexities.
llalf-Priminister Page, at Lithgow
(N.S.W.), last week:-
There can be no doubt now that, the Customs
revenue, will be in excess of the [i.e., his own]
estimate arid a surplus will arise in the year’s
accounts. Such surplus might be wisely used in
two ways—either by the relief of taxation or by
the reduction of debt. Our maturing war obligations
are so heavy that such surplus, it seems to me, can
be applied better to the reduction of our national
debt.
Considering that the surplus will be largely
the product of duties on the goods imported
by six improvident State Governments, goods
and duties being charged up to loans, it
would be dishonest to apply it to “the relief
of taxation.” Still, the Treasurer’s state-
ment is puzzling to students of his Budget.
In that document he allowed for a 1923-24
credit balance of £47,152. With this £47,152
he expected to have, on June 30, 1924, an
accumulated surplus of £7.475,726, of which
he said “there is no necessity to apply the
whole of it in redemption of the public debt,
because definite arrangements have been made
for an adequate sinking fund.” 11 is
posals for the disposition of the £7,475.726
were as under:—
One-third shall be devoted towards the redemption
of the national debt, one-third set aside for capital
works of the Department of Defence, if such works
shall become necessary owing to failure of the forth-
coming Imperial Conference to formulate a scheme
for Empire defence that will satisfy Australia, and
one-third to remain in the Treasury in order that
increased taxation will not be necessary as a result
of any adjustment with the States, or of an unex-
pected shortage of customs and excise revenue.
Dr. llalfaleaf now says that "all the money
we can spare at the present time should be
used for the reduction of our war debt.”
This may be interpreted to mean, among
other things, that the £2,500,000 held as a
Defence reserve is not to be so expended. Yet
Australia has heard nothing about any scheme
for its protection having been arrived at by
the Imperial Conference; indeed, the news
from Britain suggests that the. Singapore
naval base proposed by the Conservative Gov-
ernment will be abandoned by the Labor Min-
istry, with the support of Asquith’s
Liberals. Dr. Page should really explain
his explanation.
♦
Freetrade and Plutocracy.
Lord LEVErhulme voiced an ancient fallacy
in the S. M. Herald on Friday:—
While industries were protected by high tariff
walls Australia would never develop in the true
sense, although it might mean prosperity to a few.
The decision of the official compilers of
statistics is that the discrepancies between
wealth and indigence are greater in
England than in any of the protec-
tionist countries, particularly America,
the home of the worker with a motor-
car. The “pound” millionaire is almost
unknown in highly-protected France, outside
international banking circles, though, accord-
ing to the figures for 1920, there are 48,531
franc millionaires, of whom a favored couple
of hundred possess the British equivalent of
£14,000 a year. On the other hand, there is
an enormous middle-class (£4OO-£lOOO a
year) equally distributed between town and
country, and'except for unemployables, prac-
tically no unemployed classes. The “Daily
Mail Year Book” (1924) discloses that nine
British estates of over a million sterling and
20 of over half a million paid death
duties during 1923, while over 200 estates
were levied upon which in France would have
been high up in the millionaire (franc) sec-
tion. As a set-off against these indications of
individual prosperity, between one and two
million Britishers are on doles, and about 12
millions are on the bread-line through inade-
quate employment, the plight of many edu-
cated middle-class city families being almost
as trying as that of the Russian bourgeoisie.
A variant of tlie claim that Protection means
"prosperity to a few" was the argument often
heard in Australia 20 years ago that Pro-
tection “created trusts which could not live
in the healthy atmosphere of world competi-
tion.” It is not often heard nowadays when
Britain has industrial trusts—such as the
cotton combine —which rival for size and
predatoriness anything of the sort in the
U S.A. • when British railways have amal-
gamated after the American model; when a
newspaper trust of the llearst type has
made its malign appearance; and when Lord
Leveriidlme himself controls interests valued
at £100,000,000. The commonsense of the
matter is that there is no essential differ-
ence between protecting a country s indus-
trial life by tariffs and protecting its
national life by armaments. Both systems
admit of abuses. But a country which fears
to encourage great industrial undertakings
of its own is merely asking to be exploited
by the successful institutions of foreign
nations whieh have known no such fears, m
the same way as pacifist lands, such as
Korea, are compelled to endure the atten-
tions of alien brass-liats by way of penalty
for not having created brass-hats of their
own.

Lovely Woman as a Voter.
J. Hard Nock’s blast of the trumpet:—
I go further than “S. Malaprop,” who suggests
(B. 3/l/’24) that the N. S. Wales female voter ! s
to blame for politicians like Davidson and G.
McGirf.. I hold enfranchised woman responsible for
the disappearance of principles from Australian poli-
tics, as well as for the undeniable decline in the
quality and conduct of our public men. Not deli-
berately responsible, for she didn’t will these evils
upon her distracted country, but responsible in the
sense that the dear creature is a bundle of emotions
and prejudices, who has never learned to make an
intelligent use of the vote which a. large majority
of her never asked for and didn’t want. it is
instructive to compare the election addresses of
Parkes and Robertson, Griffith and Mcllwraitii,
Berry and Service, Barton and Reid with those of
Hughes and Charlton, of Fuller and Dooley.
The great political battles of a past that knew not
skirted constituents were waged on worthy issues.
The powerful personalities of those times gave the
people credit for having heads on their shoulders,
and sought by means of argument to gain their sup-
port for principles. Their degenerate successors
appeal, not to reason or patriotism, but to cupidity,
sectionalism, class, sectarian and racial antagonisms.
General elections have become sordid competitions
in bribery and in the exploitation of ignoble fears
and animosities and prejudices. The most successful
politicians are those who are most skilful in the
employment of these methods. They drive out legis-
lators of the Deakin school as bad money drives
out good. And they get most of their support from
the delightful but unreasoning sex which is prone
to look on politics as the loveliest sort of bargain
sale, and is, therefore, easily caught with the bird-
lime of maternity bonuses, endowments, doles
and the like; which can be readily per-
suaded in times of excitement to vote against
a man because of his religion (the savage sec-
tarianism which disgraced N. S. Wales a year or
so ago was mainly a feminine outbreak) ; and which
lacks the sense of responsibility that comes of paying-
taxes. The women’s vote is the hope of the basest kind
of politician, of the prohibitionist, of the pacifist who
loves every country but his own, and, in war time,
of the defeatist, as we discovered at the 1916 con-
scription referendum —the most cowardly of expedi-
ents which created the most dangerous of precedents.
In the U.S.A. it has established a dictatorship of
fanaticism tempered by the bootlegger, along with
a forest of freak laws. In Britain it has been the
principal factor in the rise of the Labor-Socialist
party, which has a great scheme for ruining its
opponents by a levy on capital, and a numerous
section of which talks sullenly of “getting out oi
this bourgeois Empire,” though without that Empire
Britain will sink from its proud position among the
nations to a place alongside Denmark and Norway.
When the Labor-Socialist Government arrives it will
reduce the voting age for women from 30 to 21, and
abolish all the other restrictions, in whieh case the
destinies of the British Empire whieh, once in every
century at least, has to go to war in order to pre-
serve its existence, will be in the hands of two
million surplus females. They take a different view
of the matter in France. It was Clemenceau who
said that if womanhood suffrage were proposed in
France, and if peaceful methods of averting the
disaster failed, he would go into the streets of Paris
and fight behind a barricade.
Our Duty to the Heathen.
Solomon Malaprop gives out his text: —
“The White Australia policy, from one point of
view, is the most selfish ever conceived. It is a
stinging irritant to the festering sore of color anti-
pathies The White Australia policy entails the
responsibility of bettering to the fullest extent in
our power the way of living of these people whom
we exclude by our immigration laws —the responsi-
bility of changing these traditions and customs whieh
are not considered fit for our acceptance. We should
extend to the East the hand of Christian fellow-
ship. But we shall have to act quickly, for a storm
is brewing. These races are becoming embittered.
They resent our policy of exclusion.” —From the
proceedings of the recent Church of England Men’s
Conference at Sydney.
And delivers his sermon:—
The air is thick with references to the fact that
our colored stranger in Asia, erroneously called a
brother, just as his country is erroneously described
as the East, and particularly our colored fellow-
subject in India, objects to be shut out of Australia,
just as everybody objects to be shut out of another
person’s property if lie wants to get in. Even
rabbits and burglars have been known to give way
to wrath in such circumstances. The anger is in
the main an artificial or simulated emotion, created
by a small capitalistic and slightly educated class
on which the white man has wasted too much time
and to much valuable effort. But supposing it was
general and spontaneous, and supposing the parties
concerned were 20 times as mad as they are, and
were wild unto seventy times seven, it would matter
nothing so long as our defences were kept in order ;
whieh, unfortunately, they are not.
There is no question of “changing these tradi-
tions and customs which are not considered fit far
our acceptance,’’ partly because the idea would be
a preposterous case of megalomania, or varicose
cranium, and partly because we haven’t the slightest
ambition to fit the colored brother for our accept-
ance. The Asiatic, taken in the mass, has no
claim on the world in consideration of pioneering
work done —certainly no Such claim as can be
put forward by the Portuguese, Spaniard, Dutchman,
Frenchman or Briton. Australia, even more empty-
then than now, waited for him to occupy it during
a million or two of years, and because the case was
one which involved hard and original spade work, it
waited in vain. But for the fact that the European.

caine along, it might be waiting still. Being a per-
sistent dropper-in at other men’s houses, and a
confirmed and habitual sitter-down at other men’s
tables, he is more than willing to come along now in
any quantity, and is understood to have a bitter
grievance because he isn’t asked.
Asia has called in on Europe often, and the places
where it called loudest and stayed longest are the
worst places. Russia, more especially Eastern
Russia, the lands which were once the Greek Empire,
and in a less degree Spain and Portugal are evidences.
It visited Northern Africa, which the Romans had
half Europeanised, and did no good there either.
If it extended the hand of fellowship there was
always a gun in it. Our colored fellow-subject from
India is in Natal to-day, and is a nuisance in the
present and a danger in the future. A strong im-
pression prevails that the colored, partly-colored
and mixed races have a great deal too much of the
globe already, and especially too much of the tempe-
rate zone. In fact, though dreary platitudinarians
say that the cool regions are the white man’s natural
heritage, and that he should stick to them and
let colored brother have the tropics, the reality is
that about three-fourths of the colored folk have
pegged out their blaims in the temperate zone, and
have taken the best part of it. Pallid philanthropists
and pragmatic highbrows hold that Shem should
have the hot lands of Northern Australia, because
he is specially fitted for them, and the cool lands
of Northern India, because he is very specially fitted
for them, and the very cold lands of Northern China,
because he is most dashed specially fitted for them;
and these dull persons don’t get smothered in ridi-
cule nearly often enough.
A great deal of maudlin sympathy is spent on
certain Asiatic States because of their “teeming
millions,’’ and the lack of space to teem in, unless
they bring their black or brown incompetence to our
“Empty North,” and shut it permanently against
white settlement. Unfortunately there exist people
so badly packed that they can’t teem unless each
of them has 10 square miles to do it in. The
Chinese Empire, with 74 Chows to the square mile
(official native estimate), isn’t full. It is only
stupid and backward. The Indian Empire, with 177
to the mile, or much the same as Scotland, isn’t
crowded. It is merely a relic. If the teeming
millions are a trouble to themselves, the simple
remedy is to leave off teeming by their own effort —
not ours. Man is not his brother’s keeper, for
Cain asked the question and got no answer; but if
he is, I hold that it is the nigger’s turn to keep
us. I am willing to receive and acknowledge
subscriptions from him with that end in view. But I
prefer them by post. No personal interviews will
be granted.

The American Exporter lately published
an article showing what a good thing Free-
trade would be for Australia. For a start:
One of the economic fallacies hardest to overcome
is that to the effect that the ideal foreign trade
situation of a nation would be to import nothing
but export all it c0u1d.... They fail to realise that
the very basis of foreign trade is the interchange
of products.
According to his own official figures. Uncle
.Samuel in the six years 19X7-22 exported
“products” valued at 7,685.485,583 dollars,
and imported them to the value of only
4,041,339,563 dollars. So he got as near as
he could to the idea of importing nothing
and exporting all he could. In fact, he
cursed the interchange of products with a
liberal curse; and he claims to have be-
come unprecedently rich on the process, pos-
sessing mountains of coin that he hardly
knows what to do with (408 million dollars
of gold came into the IT.S. in 1922, and
only 27 millions went out), and a lien on
most of the globe, including Queensland.
He claims that under this policy he has
attained a point where every hod-carrier
owns his own motor-car, if not his own sky-
scraper. But there is room for only one
United States in the world at a time. It
can only carry on by other nations not
doing likewise, and if it thinks one of them,
even a tiny one like Australia, may take to
that imitation which is the sincerest form
of flattery, papers like the American Ex-
porter give way to a frenzy of anger, simu-
lated contempt and gratis instruction in the
rudiments of political economy. Away back
in pre-Federation days, a paid agent of the
German Department of Commerce ran an
organ in Melbourne with similar ends in
view. It was the most frenziedly Freetrade
organ ever known, and the evidence it manu-
factured every week to prove that Australia
could only prosper by keeping its ports open
to German goods was staggering. When
the foreign capitalist becomes so sorry for
us it is time to be suspicious of the foreign
capitalist. He didn't make his pile by
altruism.

The election of a third of the French Senate
has just taken place, and Poincare has been
returned for the Meuse “by an enormous majo-
rity.” Of course, this is represented as a
great popular endorsement of the Poincare
policy in relation to Germany; but it is not
necessarily anything of the kind. In all the
world there is not another Second Chamber
so thoroughly and directly representative of
the people as our own Senate. Among Eng-
lish-speaking people, Canada has its House
of nominees, who are invariably frankly
partisan; South Africa lias its Chamber
partly nominated, partly elected by the pro-
vincial councils and the members of the
elected Federal House; Maorilaud has for
many years past had a nominated body. In
France the Second Chamber is elective. For
that matter every body is an elective body;
even a so-called nominated body is chosen by
some group—-it may be a Cabinet; it may
be the “machine” of a party. In France it
is in the main the municipal councils ; and
all the world over, and with rare exceptions,
municipal councils represent the Conserva-
tive minority, if the French Senate was
not designed to represent that minority it
was certainly designed to represent the most
matured judgment of the community. No
man under 40 may be elected to it; and this
provision has had a very interesting result.
\ cry few men under 50 like to regard them-
selves as no longer young; consequently very
few under 50 are candidates for a Chamber
deliberately placarded “The House of the Old
Men.” And when a man has reached 50 lie
will, as a rule, either not want to go up for
a Parliamentary election at all unless he has
already been a politician, or on his retire-
ment from business, if he is bitten by the
political bug, lie will want to go for a House
where elections are not numerous—and for
this Senate a man is elected for nine years,
if he is elected at all. Consequently this
Second Chamber of the French consists of
men who are for the most part well over
50; many of them have previously gained
distinction in the Chamber of Deputies, and
some others have had distinguished
careers in commerce or the professions. The
HIS WONDERFUL FEAT.
“Though he had to pay a good deal, more for the money, N.S.W. Treasurer Cocks claims that by
recent Joan conversions he really saved the country two or three hundred thousands a year.”
S ' ARTHUR: “Congratulate me on my driving, young man. Front wheel saved, my hat
untouched, and look at the back se at- —absolutely intact,”
body has thus acquired a prestige not quite
equalled by any other Second Chamber, so
that a President may, as Poincare did, step
trom the highest office in the Republic and
become a member of this remarkable Cham-
ber without any loss of dignity.

Randolph Bedford replies:—
If Donald Gunn (B. 10/l/’24) is an “old pioneer”
who was not “fraudulent and ignorant” he has not
the right to resent any statement of mine. Mr.
Gunn has not lost either his life or Iris health in
opening up my electorate, and the statement that I
owe my electorate to anybody of Mr. Gunn’s sort
of political thought or lack of it is merely silly.
And I do not believe in Government or any other
ownership of cattle stations close to a railway where
the more remunerative freight from sheep raising
can be made available. The statement that Dillalah
is run on the fall-down system of Kidmanism is
merely false. Mr. Gunn “can’t understand a strong
A.W.U. electorate choosing an absentee writer of
romances as its member,” but that means only that
Mr. Gunn understands very little. As a fact, I’m a
better Australian than Mr, Gunn, and know more
of bush Australia than he does. Also, his solicitude
for “many a hard-working, honest member of the
A.W.U. resident in the electorate” is the joke of a
very humorless person. The only “pioneers” I
insulted were the “fraudulent, ignorant pioneers”
who were often absentees physically and pioneers by
proxy.

Hear Bulletin, —Randolph Bedford's
electorate may be larger than Victoria, as
lie says (B 27/12/’23) ; but, big as it is, I
doubt whether it is big enough, now that
he has .joined the ranks of Queensland’s
►Super-Eminents. You have no idea down in
your little places, like Victoria, bow Big
We Are Up Here! It is an accepted belief,
a sort of Theodore Legend, that the men
still m office here (better not ask how they
stick there) are veritable giants and admin-
istrative Titans, and that Queensland would
collapse if Providence sent a poltical cata-
clysm and they were blown oft’ the Treasury
benches. Even reputed Nationalists and
alleged United parties and ostensible Country
party persons share (or pretend to share)
in the superstition. Queerly enough, it was
begun in The Bulletin years ago; and the
gentleman who began it was Randolph Bed-
ford himself! When T. J. Ryan (by virtue
of his promise of cheap food) and Theo-
dore and Fihelly (by virtue of their deafen-
ing demand for honest finance and restric-
tion of loans) had got into office. Randolph
Bedford rushed up to have a look at tiiem,
and then wrote a column of your smallest
print in terms which made them ecstatic, and
eventually landed him in the (at present)
vanished Legislative Council. The strong
wine of Randolph Bedford’s adulatory re-
ferences to them went to their heads and
intoxicated them. They didn’t know that
their trumpeter always blows fortissimo in
print, so they took themselves at his then
valuation, and have gone on doing so ever
since. Theodore now regards himself and
his crowd as Indispensables—and lays out
the country accordingly. Randolph Bed-
ford, too, will now regard himself as an In-
dispensable, and that is one reason why I
maintain that his enormous electorate may
be found to be too small for him. —Yours,
etc., O. C. Cabot.

From: the inside of the G.P.O.:—
Thanks to the Murray Multiplex, the Telegraph
Branch coped splendidly with the Christmas rush.
Two months ago the Murray took, a three weeks’ spell,
while a hive of mechanics buzzed around £lOO,OOO
worth of machinery. Late one afternoon it re-
opened for business. The tearing Wheatstone auto-
matic (working two ways per wire as against the
Murray’s eight) was long ago overmatched' in the
race with the telegraph traffic, and the day’s biz. was
hours in arrears. The Murray brought it up with
a rush. The restless cogs clawed the tape from the
busy' assistants like an outsize cliaffeutter tears hav
through. All day Saturday and Christmas Eve a
veritable flood of telegrams surged over the wires.
The Murray handled the heavy intev-S'tate traffic,
and hour after hour the restless mechanism with its
rhythmic throb-throb-throb ate it up. Practically, the
business was held. Only “greetings” messages were
left over. All death, sick and other important
wires were Sorted out and despatched. The balance
was delivered early on Boxing Day. N.S.W. country-
business is handled through collector, or repeating,
centres, at Wagga, Bathurst and elsewhere. Rivers
of telegrams poured over the duplex lines that join
these to Sydney. A duplex line carries two streams
of messages, one each way, and from two up to six
are provided for each centre, according to the
amount of traffic. Wagga repeats for a piece of
country about the size of Victoria and can work
with Sydney “five ways.” Where a centre lagged
unduly, a wire' was allotted to the bustling Wheat-
stone, and arrears whipped up. These lines were
clear at 9 p.m. In Sydney suburbs a fleet of
motor-bikes were let loose. On Christmas Eve these
handled 10,700 wires without hitch or loss. The
day’s tally at Sydney G.P.O. was about 115,800:
100 men worked for about 10 hours. I have pushed
’grams around the world and don’t know of a
better performance.

From a grower in the Dawson Valley (Q.) :
My practical experience is that I contracted liabili-
ties 18 months ago under the impression that cotton-
growing was a straight-out winner, and as I can
grow nothing else on the place it is a case of cotton
or the deluge with me. I ploughed under my last year’s
plants and sowed fresh seed as directed by the
Theodore Government; but the old plants showed
up as soon as the seedlings, and lasted longer, as
the sun burned the young plants off. I ploughed
and planted again, but the wallabies got the
young shoots, leaving the ratoons to be used as evi-
dence against me. These came up after the third
ploughing and are now flowering. I might get a
sort of crop even yet from my seedlings if the weather
will behave itself for the next month or so; but
I am sure of something from my ratoon plants
that will not be killed. I will also be sure of
a £5O fine if anyone likes to pass the word along;
and so will every other cotton cocky in the district.
If only the cotton-bush would die when it is
officially dead, and if only seedling cotton would
live when it is officially alive, there would be money
in the game. But so much time is taken up in
trying to kill the one and propagate the other, and
1 iieodore’s sleuths can gather in such a harvest
of growers at any time he likes to send them out,
that a steady wages job on some loan “develop-
mental” works is much surer. It looks like that
or gaol at present, anyhow, for most of us, if
the present prohibition against growing ratoon cotton
is not lifted.
Henry Fletcher is pessimistic:—
It is not enough that enthusiastic battlers for
Socialism should have their life’s dream shattered
b y Henry Ford’s demonstration that a certain brand
of Capitalism gives, for the majority of individuals,
better results ; a late meeting of the English Whole-
sale Co-operative Co. —the alleged model society of
this kind—shows that Red Tape has got it by the
throat, and that economically it is qualifying for
inateship with an Australian Government trading
department. According to a complaining delegate, the
society’s price for flour was 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per
sack above that of competitors. This results, accord-
ing to other authorities, from accumulated overhead
charges, the fruit of poor business capacity.
Tlfe Rochdale pioneer co-operators, taking theii
first barrow-load of goods to their one room, under-
stood the goods and their values, and, giving their
time and ability free , saved to their fellows the
trader's wage for like service. But in proportion
as the society and its offshoots expanded; the paid
wage and management item increased, the share-
holders as a body being less' and less familiar with
large affairs. A good manager required a good
salary, and responsible officers pay according to their
ability. In result a trader like Lipton, starting
from scratch, can open shops next door to co-operative
stores all over Britain, undersell them, and become
a millionaire.
How does Lipton —to name one of a numerous
class—do it ? Whore is the leak ? There is no leak
except the absence in the average co-operative enter-
prise of one factor —organising financial genius joined
to personal initiative. This vitamine in an enter-
prise is sterilised by red tape and crowd control,
or co-operative control grown to crowd dimensions.
How, then, are we to apply the Gettysburg shib-
boleth —-“Government of the people, by the people,
for the people”? I don’t know.

There being some sort of gentleman’s
agreement that the issue of tax-free loans
(free not only of existing income-taxes but
of possible increases) should cease at the
end of 1923, N.S.W. Treasurer Cocks, just
prior to that date, invited bondholders to take
up a big renewal loan eight months before
the renewal was due. His critics say that
Ills tax-free issue at 5| per cent, was equal
to an honest straight-out loan at 01 or 6;j
per cent., and that in the struggle to dis-
guise a rotten situation he made a rotten
bargain. He says that he did something

POLITICAL POINTS
Forty or fifty years ago somebody told a
young soap-boiler named Lever that “some-
body had to do the donkey-work of the
world”; and the young man liked the phrase
and started using it, and has gone on using
it ever since. He has never come to Aus-
tralia without using it. He has hardly ev« r
used any other in public—always somebody
had to do the world’s donkey-work, and
therefore we ought to “introduce” colored
donkeys to do it. It is really not worth
while arguing with the man who used to
be a young soap-boiler but is a very old soap-
boiler now. The remark has become a habit,
and so far as this paper, at any rate, is con-
cerned, it would as soon try to rob him of
his old grey hat.
Ramsay Macdonald’s fireworks began to
turn into squibs pretty early. He failed to
produce his scheme for a “levy on capital,”
and it transpired that he meant to leave
details to a committee of experts —generally
another name for capitalists. People thought
the cocksure leader had some new ideas on
the subject, but apparently he had none. It
was a feeble thing to say that “if capital
flees from the country when we come into
power the panic-mongers will be responsible,
not the Labor party.” The threat to annex
50 per cent, of any really big fortune was
calculated to make any man export his port-
able valuables, and mortgage his fixed assets
for all he could to U.S. capitalists, and
plant the proceeds of the mortgage in the
First Manhattan Cocktail Bank, where they
couldn’t be seized except by process of war.
The French hold that the astute Hun has
hid his money abroad so skilfully that even
if they seized the biggest bank as part pay-
ment of the indemnity they would get little
except the books and a heap of that paper
money the sight of which makes them sick.
There has been some guessing in Adelaide
whether Barwell, who is Attorney-General
as well as Premier, would collar the seat on
the Supreme Court Bench vacant through
the death of John Gordon. Years ago this
grab was a matter of course. Gordon him-
self was a result of it; so were Boucaut and
the remarkable Chief Justice Way, who
never had a decision reversed in close on 40
years. But a Labor Ministry scrapped the
custom 10 or 12 years back, and Barwell
lias promptly announced that he does not
intend to go back to it.
It is a standing Freetrade gag that im-
ports of goods are always paid for by ex-
ports of goods, and that to refuse to take
the other fellow’s “truck” because we want to
make things for ourselves is—well, it simply
can’t be done. Yet Australia owes about
£400,000,000 of foreign debt because it im-
ported goods and didn’t export enough goods
to pay for them. And the U.S. has most
of the world's bullion and a mortgage on
most of the globe because it sent out much
merchandise for many years and took little
in return, demanding gold, silver and interest-
bearing bonds for the balance. But these
discrepancies don’t trouble the Freetrader,
who says that Cobden and Henry George
said that things are so, therefore they are
even if they aren’t.
Premier Mitchell, of Westralia, has just
mentioned dispassionately 7 that his State has
enjoyed 19 deficits in 23 years—the last four,
of course, being his own —and that he has
arranged for another big one at June, 1924,
and he apparently won’t worry much about
one in 1925. He mentioned, as if it was
only the weather, that his State owes
£59,000,000, which is close up £2OO per head.
He just glanced at the loan policy of the
year, which aims at adding another £l3 per
head to the bill, three-quarters for works
which hardly try to look productive. He
didn’t suggest putting a trifle on to taxation
to prevent huge shortages, though his State
is consistently the lowest taxed save one,
and often the lowest taxed of all. He didn’t
even hint that deficits are bad; in fact, he
took a calm view of the whole matter, as if
ir had happened 100 years ago to an ape in
the middle of Africa.
There is every prospect of the Common-
wealth being held up for £1,900,000 of the
general fund to complete the N.S.W.-Queens-
land coastal line, making a standard-gauge
railway from Albury to Brisbane, barring the
lack of the Clarence bridge. It is proposed
that another wad of the common fund shall
be contributed for this. Tasmania’s share
of £1,900,'000 will be about £BO,OOO. Its
share of the bridge may add to this. The
island’s proportion of the Westralian desert
line liability is about £280,000. Small Sister
would much like to ring in a few jobs of
her own on the “national” basis, but she lacks
tin 1 voting power or the right politicians or
something.
Concerning the S.A. election -
Ex-Premier John Verran has gone over to Liberal-
ism, and is going to preach his new gospel in his
old constituency, Wallaroo. John has hopes which
tew share. His son S.J., sitting member in the
Labor interest for Port Adelaide, has had to make
way there for the vigorous and popular Condon.
Condon will hold the Port seat, hut Verrans
prospects are dim in Sturt. Barwell reckons he is
safe in Stanley. Richard Butler’s hold on Barossa
is, however, precarious. The Speaker is 73, and has been
in the Assembly since 1890. Indications point to a
close fight between the Libs, and the Labs., with a
strong possibility of the Cocky group holding the
ba’ance 'of power. The same might really have been
written of every election held in Australia during
the past few years, except the late affair in Queens-
land, . ,
The N.S.W. bread situation is curious.
Night baking used to be the custom, just
like the night printing of a Labor daily,
the object being to have the loaf and the
THE NEW RIDER.
“The British Labor Party is confidently demanding its first taste of power.”
JOHN BULL: “He seems determined to have a ride—hut will he handle the horse right and
obey the owner’s instructions?”
news fresh in the morning. Some people
rose against it, and it was prohibited, but
as many men wanted to night-bake the union
agents had to do a good deal of night work
getting evidence for the prosecution. Now
night-baking is legal again, but orders have
gone forth from angry quarters that the law
shall be null and void. One coal-mining Par-
liament has even enacted that if one of its
members buys night bread he shall be fined
the first and second times, and the third time
shall be expelled. Wherefore, there is a con-
flict of authorities, and Attorney-General
Bavin can decide which is to prevail.
If ever there was a case calling for swift
and certain action it was furnished by the
disclosures made by the Acting-Prime Min-
ister at Bathurst on January 8, when refer-
ring to the Fruit Pool. This was originated
ostensibly to give relief to the fruitgrowers:
and what happened? Dr. Page declares that,
although the price paid for the fruit was
only £350,000, a loss of £500,000 had re-
sulted ! But the gem of I)r. Page’s statement
is that “under the scheme everybody was
safeguarded except the Government." If
such an appalling admission was made by a
chairman of directors to his shareholders
there would be a quick change in the man-
agement. The acting-chairman of Australia,
Unlimited, makes this amazing statement to
its shareholders, but not a word is said of
a change anywhere. There must have
been gross ineptitude, and the question to
which the suffering taxpayer might direct his
attention and energies is: Are the same offi-
cials to be trusted to safeguard the people’s
interests as have so manifestly failed to do
ir in the case of the fruit pool?
When Dr. Argyle, Vic. Chief Sec., was
a private member he suggested at a party
meeting that bets should be taxed according
to their size, starting with a penny on a
five-shilling wager. So that the public would
pay, he urged that coupons 'should be sold
at kiosks on the racecourses and handed to
the bookmakers with the bets. In recalling
this caucus incident the other day, Argyle
said he didn’t back horses, but those who
did had told him that the bookies who whined
at “paying’’ the betting tax simply passed
it on to the public by shortening the odds
and “in other ways.’’ People, he thought,
might just as well be shorn directly by being
required to buy coupons. But why not
simplify the process by installing the total-
isator?' There would be no question then
about the collection. Of course the public
pays in any case, but with the tote it would
certainly have to pay only once.
Towards the upkeep of the refreshment-
rooms at Federal Parliament House the
public pays an annual subsidy of £lB a mem-
ber. That seems bad enough, but in the case
of the Vic. Parliament the exchequer is
tapped to the extent of £27 a member. Cus-
tom is pleaded in extenuation of this grace-
less sponging, but there are no parallels in
other walks of life. Seeing that rooms,
appointments, kitchen, bar and service are
provided free, the least these legislators can
do is to weigh out the net cost of their pro-
vender and nosepaint instead of charging
most of it to the taxpayer.
Significant drink news continues to arrive
from George Washington’s country, the
United States of Hysterica—not in the shape
of letters from paid partisans, but from the
same news agencies which tell us when Hard-
ing dies, and Coolidge succeeds, and Ford
makes another billion. In Philadelphia one
General Butler was lately appointed a sort
of municipal Mussolini, and in 48 hours
he discharged eight corrupt police “captains,”
and closed 900 drink-sliops to begin with.
A similar dictator in New York is closing
diinkeries “by hundreds." In Washington
“socially important persons and Govern-
ment officials’’ have been found handling
liquor, but the police have suppressed the
names. In Illinois the Ku Klux Klan is
assisting the Law, which has its hands full.
Fifty arrests of drink-sellers were made in
one day in “Bloody Williamson county, but
the 50 were bailed out, or bailed each otliei
out, resumed business, and gathered armed
forces in defence of Drink. Machine-guns
were brought into the courthouse lest liquor
should seize the Law instead of the Law
seizing liquor. IJncle Sam is paying all
right for the trick by which he dropped Ins
people into the prohibition pot long before
they were ready for it.
When the last N.S.W. Labor Government
was in office the word went round that
Queensland Premier Theodore didn’t approve
of it—thought it too conservative, and so
on. This wasn’t the least of the Storey-
Dooleys’ embarrassments, and it has not
been forgotten. So when Theodore arrived
in Sydney recently the most conspicuous
thing that greeted him on the Central Sta-
tion was the absence of Lang, the JN.S.YV.
Labor leader. The excuse was that Lang
was away in the country. It is always
convenient to have a country to be away in.
Those Melbourne retailers whose shop-
fronts were smashed up during the police
strike are still banging at the Treasury door
for £17.000 to.cover their losses. Counsel has
advised them that they have “a strong moral
claim,” but Lawson is a lawyer and the
legal aspect is all lie will consider. He will
not admit any liability. As recruiting for
the police force is slow, the Ministry is be-
stirring itself to find some kind of work
to get the strikers out of the road. Mean-
while the Trades Hall has decreed that no
unionist may accept a job in the force under
pain of excommunication. So the trail of
the mutiny, or whatever it was, is still very
much over Victoria.
The Vic. Cockies are running a candidate
for Dalhousie, which the Liberals regard as
their own property, and the Lawson-Allan
coalition is in danger. Lawson is being
urged to force a rupture and reconstruct once
more from his own team, and lie is said to
have the assurance that the Cockies wouldn’t
avenge the move by putting him out. Pro-
bably Allan would welcome a return to his
mournful isolation ; the attitude of the mal-
contents in the Farmers’ Union has troubled
him sorely. During the negotiations for an
alliance Lawson was advised to come to
some arrangement to avoid cut-throat com-
petition at elections, and lie is now sorry
that he waved the suggestion aside.
The N.S.W. revenue came in well during
the last half of 1923, except the horse-race
revenue, which dropped some 10 per cent".
It may be that too much swindle threatens
to kill the horse that laid the disreputable
egg.
From the Gallery :
The Auditor-General’s annual report always dwells
rather pathetieailly on the refreshment-rooms at
Federal Parliament House. Affected by the deadhead
spirit, members don’t take kindly to parting up
the nominal charge for a first-rate meal, and the
result is always a good deal of tick, which is duly
totted up at the end of the financial year and
carried over into the next. In the last balance-sheet
an item of £l7B Bs., “sundry debtors for refresh-
ments supplied,” testifies to the meanness of some
members who consistently do their bit to blacken
the record of the place. The dining-room has never
paid, and, unless it moderates its philanthropy, it
never will. Its actual deficit each year hovers
between £l5OO and £2OOO. In the period 1922-28
it lost £1654 16s. 9d. ; but by deducting salaries
£1257 15s. lOd. and crediting the account with
£llOO, “grant in aid,” a tame Treasury magician
produces a credit balance of £702 19s. id., and so
everything in the kitchen is lovely.
From a headmaster with 40 years' experi-
ence :
The employer proud of the success of his “boys” is
defunct; the tradesman who, glorying in his work,
loved to pass the tradition on, is as dead as
Caesar; the old question, “What shall we do with
our boys?” was never so acute, and on a satisfactory
answer depends the success of the Commonwealth.
“We can demand 85 bob a day. * Why give our
brains to starters to lower future wages?” was the
recent argument of a skilled worker. A third-year
apprentice in a factory complained: “The first
quarter I became expert in four operations. I have
been kept at those ever since, and slight improve-
ments in machinery could make me useless to-
morrow.” And this from a big employer with a
few apprentices: “Too much worry; stuff spoilt;
log wages too high; men won’t teach ’em; find it
cheaper in the long run to employ tradesmen.”
Where’s the remedy? It is up to us to sit at the
feet of Gamaliel, even though he be the Hun. Here
is the system: Each boy to select an occupation, or
have it selected for him, and then by intensive
technical training, compulsorily continued by day or
evening classes, proceeding continuously until the
finished article is evolved. On his first tour, Vic.
Education Director Tate found in one German town
a crowd of alert young fellows sweating at archi-
tecture under a professor, to assure the future
correct 'cleaning of chimneys. Even the chimney-
sweep had to be a technically-trained man, with a
corresponding pride in his job.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At peace he might be with the world and God,
Content with life and satisfied with fate,
And ho might go in gladness to his sod
If those that near the mystic grave’s edge wait
Can smile upon his bier and truly say:

Loved truth and beauty, bled in manly fray,
And found a sunlit grave beside the sea.”
What more than that? Unless, perchance, they add:
“He loved his country better than himself,

*The prefs. (5 p.c.) get £25,000 p.a.
When markets collapsed a couple of years
ago and commission earnings shrank, Dal-
gety’s management could not reduce expenses
correspondingly, so the profits from handling
wool, wheat and other produce were slender.
But the co. is also a very big investor in
public securities —almost two millions is now
in gilt-edged investments —and they and the
advances business saved the situation. A
refund by the British Government of
£158,000 of “excess profits duty” permitted
tlie payment of 15 p.c. divs. for the 1922
financial year. During the 12 months to
June 30 last the wool and dairy-produce
markets so improved that more than £14,000
of profit was visibly left after paying 15
p.c. on ordinaries —the pref. and ord. divs.
together took £175,000 —anti after reducing
the book value of premises by £50,000. Pro-
bably the co. did better than that: it is only
necessary to glance at the figures presented
during the war years, when abnormal profits
were made easily in boom markets, to bo
convinced that the big concern must have
socked away a lot in inner reserves. The
outsider cannot learn how much is made in
any year because unspecified amounts are
sheared from gross profits for bad and doubt-
ful debts, depreciation and contingencies.
All these provisions are additional to the
regular reduction of book values of produce-
stores and office premises. This much only
is visible from the published accounts: pre-
mises which cost £962,217 have been reduced
in the books to £397,217; £1,301,860 of mis-
cellaneous public securities are given a value
of a round million. This slaughtering of
the office values of better-class assets sug-
gests that the more risky sections of the
business have also been fortified. Dalgety’s
seems to be on such solid foundations that
nothing short of a national disaster can
shake it; and as the past few years have
shown, even national disasters may have mil-
lions in them for some people.
The balance-sheet position is set out in
the following comparison of figures for the
past three years :

Cash & investments 1,927,996 3,306,962 3,014,716
Besides its own funds, the co. has the use
of £2,225,454 of perpetual stock, most of
which carries only 4 p.c. p.a. and the balance
44 p.c. It also employs £357,523 in five
lots which are tied to the business for vary-
ing periods. Against £3,188,369 of floating
debt and terminable stock no less than
£3,014,716 is held in public securities and
cash. The co. is, therefore, relying wholly
on its own funds to undertake its mammoth
operations in pastoral and farm finance.
Paid capital is made up of a million of ordi-
naries and a half-million of 5 p.c. prefs.
Visible reserves are £116,063 larger than
ordinary capital, and, of course, there are
the huge internal reserves. The 15 p.c. .on
ordinaries is a mild return when the size
of all shareholders’ funds is taken into con-
sideration. Assuming that premises are
worth all that was laid out on them, and
that other visible inner reserves are accumu-
lations of true profit, the 15 p.c. probably
represents no more than 5 p.c. on total funds.
And while that portion is distributed the
strengthening of funds continues by the hoard-
ing of large surpluses.
Gross profits for the past 12 months were
£36,321 less than those for 1920, the year
of record net profits. But almost £2lOO
more was absorbed by exes.—staff and
administrative costs were up £20,598, and
interest took £15,977 more. Here are com-
parisons for four years:—
1920. 1921. 1922. 1923.
Gross profits. . £957,298 £689,168 £775,660 £920,977

Total out-
goings £664,721 £548,562 £681.081 £666,815
The increase of the interest bill is an in-
teresting feature; borrowings at 0f p.c. to
buy public securities—even assuming the
gilt-edged stuff was purchased at a discount
in the market —seems an anomaly. But the
times are full of anomalies.

Kauri Timber continues to do very well:
for the past 12 months it distributed £60,000
of divs. and had almost £28,000 to divide
among a half-dozen reserves after £14,889
had been taken for depreciation. The figures
throughout the model accounts—-they show
trading operations and the balance-sheet posi-
tion in full detail, a rare happening in these
days—are a big. improvement on those of a
few years ago, and profits are relatively much
better also, because £135,000 of capital was
returned in the 1920 reconstruction. Prior
to that there were two classes of shares:
150,000 of 335. each and 450,000 paid to
15s. The co. returned 18s. on the former,
and that left 600,000 shares paid to 15s.
The writing-up of assets and capitalisation
of £300,000 of reserves made all shares paid
to 255., and increased paid capital to
£750,000. The bonus additions did not swal-
low all the reserves unearthed by the re-
valuation of assets, and £158,883 was left in
a contingency fund. The total of all reserves
has now been increased to £255,703. Some
of them look like specific accounts, but at
the recent meeting the directors admitted
that all were accumulations of true profit:
anyway, they included every penny of every
reserve in their estimate of shareholders’
funds.
Results for the past two years have not
been so handsome as those for 1921, when
the management was completing big con-
tracts which had been secured at war-prices,
and the profits for the past 12 months were
better than those of the previous year chiefly
because taxation was easier—Maoriland re-
duced its rate from Ss. 9d. in the £1 to 7s.
Id., and it is to bo cut to about ss. lOd.
this year—and because the management
whittled away some overhead charges. Here
are comparisons for three years-

Taxes 44,772 30,147 25,353

The past year’s profits also benefited by a
sale of assets giving £4387 more than their
book value. Owing to the writing-up of book
values in the reconstruction, comparisons of
balance-sheet figures going back beyond 1921
are not of much value. Here are those for
three years:—
1921. 1922. 1923.
Liabilities .. .. £120,080 £161,178 £64,136
Freeholds .. . . 156,930 165,646 153,020

Mortgages, loans, War
Loan and cash .. 98,073 94,072 108,783
War Loan and cash in hand alone covered
all liabilities at the balancing-date. Gener-
ally the eo.’s position is very comfortable
nowadays. It was not always so; it got
into business a few years before the big
boom collapsed, and in the ’nineties there were
no divs., and 7s. per share was written off. The
future depends on whether the recent acti-
vity in the building trade continues and on
the life of the forests. Immediate prospects
are good : the Commonwealth's industrial ex-
pansion and the boom in building-society
business assure big orders. Beyond that,
much depends on whether good seasons and
sound manufacturing development will out-
weigh our national heavy indebtedness and
oppressive taxation.

This is another co. whose shares are much
below par in the market, not because it has
been having a rough spin, but on account of
the inflation of capital by a bonus issue
which has reduced div. rates. To old holders
the past year’s 6£ p.c. meant 12 £ p.c., paid
capital having been doubled in the 1920 re-
construction. For a couple of years the
business was affected by the slump in the
export trade in frozen meat and rabbits, but
during the past 12 months the co. made a
good recovery—profits were larger in only
one other year. The management formerly
laid aside quite a lot in a reserve for depre-
ciation, and that accumulation evidently held
much more than was needed for renewals of
plant, etc., because in the reconstruction
assets were written up by approximately
£71,000. Opportunities have been fewer for
the co. since the post-war depression re-
stricted turnover, and not so much is visibly
laid aside as formerly, though the book value
of belongings is much larger owing to the
writing up. Butter has been the principal
line lately, and the outlook for that business
was very blue until the drought broke. A
couple of years ago the co. extended its
works to store the Coastal Farmers’ poultry
handlings, and that arrangement is reported
to have “proved of mutual advantage.” A
highly profitable side-line is in catering for
the ice-skater in the winter months, and the
sport last season showed no signs of slack-
ened popularity. What influence the Glaci-
arium has had on profits is not disclosed, but
it must have been helpful to the freezing
business whilst the export trade was slack.
The balance-sheet position is comfortable.
In the following comparisons of the liquid
position each year’s divs. are included with
liabilities: —
1916. 1920. 1922. 1923.
Liquid assets .. £11,427 £23,655 £16,853 £15,674
Liabilities (inc.

Excess liabilities £11,469 £2,527
Surplus assets.. £5,209 £3,593
After having made additions and alterations
to works and premises an improvement of
£15,000 has been effected in seven years. Just
at present £3593 of £150,000 of paid capital
is represented by the surplus of book debts,
cash and War Loan over and above liabili-
ties. The precise position of the co.. how-
ever, depends on how much of the £9835
which has been reserved for depreciation
since the reconstruction is actually required
to make good the wear and tear of plant,
etc., or is needed to protect capital against
any fall in values which may have taken
place since the writing-up at the tail-end of
the boom period. Other assets are the build-
ings, machinery, stores, etc., with a book
value of £124.430, and land valued at
£85,000.

The Federal Building Society reconstructed
about 20 years ago and wrote off so much of
its capital that even on a conservative valua-
tion of assets it showed £26,000-odd of re-
serves to start with: and these, instead of
being tapped to make good further losses
which were half-expected, were added to
by profits. All the old dead-wood has gone,
and lately the management has had £70,000
of reserves to help £128,000 of capital. That
explains how the co. can find 10 p.c. for its
shareholders. Like most other Melbourne
societies, this one has taken advantage of
the active demand for advances to increase
its business, but it has not been nearly so
daring as some of its competitors. In 1922
loans w T ere practically the same size as they
were just prior to the wmr; during the past
12 months all repayments and £29,093 more
were lent, and the advances are now larger
than at any time in the present co.’s life.
To do this the management went outside
for only £9826 of funds, the accounts show-
ing' £15,181 of “payments on new share
issue” in hand at the balancing-date. The
position is very snug for depositors and
other creditors; against £57,897 owing to
them there were £222,342 of shareholders'
funds in the business. The security for the
outside money is stronger thap in pre-war
days, because liabilities are almost £27,000
smaller. Here are comparisons over many
years:—
1910. 1914. 1920. 1922. 1923.

a book value of £281,068 to protect £57,897,
or £4 17s. for every £1 borrowed.

The 25 p.c. divs. are deceptive: for 38 years
the co. has been storing titbits of surplus
profit, until now there are reserves of
£18,220 to assist only £B5OO of paid capital.
Consequently earnings calculated on total
funds are nothing like so obese as divs. are.
Last year’s £3054 net profit, for instance,
was slightly less than 111 p.c. on total
funds. Besides its own funds the co. is
employing a lot of outside money: at Septem-
ber 30 £36,009 was owing on various
accounts, and there was a bank overdraft
for £5864, a total of £41,873 of external lia-
bilities, against £29,504 of the co.’s funds
prior to paying divs. . Only £2OOO of War
Loan and £8707 of stocks were in liquid
form. Premises, saloyards, plant, etc., had
a book value of £13,669. The big item was
£42,572 of advances and other accounts,
besides which were £4430 of bills receivable.
Everything, therefore, depends on the state
of health of the loans. They are apparently
all in order; the directors regularly report
having made allowances for bad and doubtful
debts and for depreciation.

When the latest accounts were presented
the East Greta Co. had just completed a
quarter-century in business. It was the
pioneer co. on the South Maitland field, but,
though it has done fairly well, newcomers,
especially those supported by shipping in-
terests, have reaped much larger harvests.
Old performances of the East Greta, how-
ever, are not now of much consequence as
a guide to prospects; this co., too, lias linked
itself to a shipping concern, and is busy de-
veloping and equipping new mines. Four
years ago paid capital was £200,000; it is
now £441,250, including 235,000- £1 shares
taken up by the Adelaide S. S. Co. and
paid to 15s. each. Old mining properties
and plant—the East Greta and Stanford
Merthyr—have a book value of £131,614.
and the co.’s railways are represented by a
shareholding of approximately £150,000 in
the South Maitland Railways, Ltd. A few
years ago 3672 acres were taken up near
Cessnock (the Millfield estate) and later
6000 acres adjoining (Aellalong) were also
purchased. The development and equipment
of the new collieries has so far run into
£240,846, and coal-winning has commenced.
How grouped balance-sheet figures have
moved is shown in the following compari-
sons :
1919. 1921. 1922. 1923.

Liquid assets 52,943 127,089 90,254 71,512
During the four years the East Greta’s posi-
tion has entirely changed; everything now
depends on the working of the valuable new
mines which have been opened up. Mean-
while the old collieries have been doing well*
and though paid capital lias been consider-
ably more than doubled since 1919 6 p.c.
was paid for the past 12 months. The direc-
tors do not state in their report whether the
heavy outlay on new collieries has
almost concluded. Anyway, the co. is in;
a position to spend a lot more money: at
September 30 there were liquid assets tot-
ting up £71,812 to set against £86,208 of

Mt. Isa proved the swiftest mining float
the Commonwealth has had for many a
year. Sydney brokers McNall and Hordern
had the complete prospectus ready only on
Tuesday afternoon of last week; by Friday
the 2500 shares of £2O each (£50,000) had
been oversubscribed. Applications continue
to flow in, and there are many disappointed
—among them a few big guns in the mining
world who were impressed by the geological
opinion that Mt. Isa may prove to be a
second Broken Hill. News of the float tra-
velled so rapidly that during the few days
the lists were open share-applications were
lodged from all around the coast from Cairns
to Perth. It will probably be found, how-
ever, that Sydney dominates. The co. goes
to registration this week, and takes over the
leases as from the 20th of this month. _ Cor-
bould will begin development work imme-
diately.
Malcolm Newman sums up Mt. Isa: —
Outcrops very favorable. In my opinion geological
formation strongly in favor of a large quantity
of ore. On the whole, I think Saint Smith’s con-
cluding paragraph, stating his difficulty in using
“language sufficiently restrained for an official
report,” is justified.

Queensland’s gold yield for 1923 was
84,8140 z. (fine) worth £360,265, an improve-
ment of 54820 z. and £23.284 on 1922. The
figures are extremely disappointing, though,
because the small increase is wholly
accounted for by Mt. Morgan, which w T as
more active. The new fields in the aggre-
gate did not come up to expectations. Nor-
manby failed entirely; Mt. Coolon improved;
but Gympie and Charters Towers went from
bad to worse.

The Billy Hughes Co.’s annual report
discloses that it has taken the best part of
a year of scouting and developing on the
Normanby field (N.Q.) to locate a show which
seems worth concentrating on. The co. set out
originally to work the Billy Hughes and other
mines on the Grant, but it was impossible
to get a battery to them, so attention was
turned to the old Normanby goldfield, about
six miles away. A lot of money was spent
on the Perseverance and other old mines, but
Walter Colley finally decided that they were
better left alone, and the Frederick mine, a
couple of miles from the defined gold belt,
was opened up. It failed to go down, and,
in any case, was a concentrating proposition
from the start. Prospector Meredith, who
vyas responsible for the finding of the Grant
mines, set to work looking for a free-milling
proposition near the old Normanby field, and,
after sampling the Bruce and Resurgam, put
a crushing through from the former and
found it too low-grade. Sinking on the Resur-
gam' was continued, and a reef 15in. wide
going down from the surface to 30ft. assayed
up to 2oz. A test crushing of 10 tons returned
120 z., with the concentrates worth Boz. and
the sands 7dwt. to the ton. In December it
w r as decided that the Resurgam shaft should
follow the ore-body down to 80ft., at which
depth the water is expected. There should
then be 80ft. of backs of free-milling ore to
stope out to the surface whilst a winding
plant is erected to cope with the water and
deepen the workings. The Marquis mine,
close handy in the same belt of country, bot-
tomed at 80ft. on mundic stone, and Mines
Department assays returned 14oz. of gold to
the ton. The Department is advancing £5OO
to assist the purchase of a winding plant.
* * * *
In November Jim Brown completed 41
years’ continuous service as manager of the
No. 4 North Phoenix, Gympie (Q.), and that
is probably an Australian record. The
Phoenix’s best crushing was 18 months ago,
when 259 tons gave 35580 z. In the palmy
days, and again in the 1898 revival, the
mine was one of the best of a bright bunch
on the field discovered by James Nash in
1867.

Cobalt prospecting is rather in the eye up
Cloncurry way. Jack Godkin is sinking a
winze on his cobalt lode on the Dugald
River, the discovery of which was reported
early last year. He has sent a trial crush-
ing to the Quamby mill. Mt. Quamby itself
has showm a very promising cobalt lode. On
prospecting indications Queensland looks
like being the greatest cobalt producer of
the future after Canada. The Ontario silver-
mines produce it as a by-product, and that
is the fly in the ointment for Australian
enterprise in mines where cobalt is practi-
cally the only product.
* * * *
A Ross mill and amalgamator is in course
of erection at the No. 2 Eclipse, Brookfield
(Q.). If the ore, which is very pyntic,
suits the plant a few small rich crushings
should be recorded. The battery material
will include some of the 50oz. vein which
was taken out a few months ago. Whether
more of this quality is available has yet to
be seen. Brookfield has gold, but on present
appearances it does not give much promise
of becoming a field.

The Russell and Johnstone Rivers Gold
and Tin Dredging Co. has gone to allot-
ment on 32,000 shares, but the share-list is
to be left open until 40,000 shares are sub-
scribed. Walter Baker, late manager of
Manuka Dredging and Perseverance Dredg-
ing (Vic.), is to take charge. He pro-
poses to commence boring the flats which
were old N.Q. river-beds to enable him
to decide on the type of bucket-dredge to
be installed.

Mt. Jackson mines, in the Georgetown dis-
trict (N.Q.),%re to get a show at the hands
of W. R. Cuthbert, of Croydon. Values are
good, but battery and flotation treatment has
so far failed to recover more than from 50
to 60 p.c. The ore is high in gold for a
mixed sulphide—up to lloz. —and that makes
it an excellent proposition so soon as silver
and lead recovery is assured. The trouble is
the zinc and copper. Mt. Cuthbert is bag-
ging a trial lot for experimental flotation
treatment.

Finney's Dill United, Indooroopilly (Q.),
has just' cleared its first shipment (26 tons)
of silver-load concentrates from its» new
plant. This , year’s output should be a
marked improvement on that for 1923.
Hampton Plains (W.A.) is still hopeful.
On Block 50 Hampton Celebration has driven
a short distance at 300 ft. on its main-shoot,
and it is described as “good looking,” ‘ pro-
mising” and “wider and of a more perma-
nent character.” The prospect of the mine
ever earning anything for shareholders, how-
ever, has not improved. On Block 48 Golden
Hope struggles on, but while. the weakly-
financed Adelaide co. believes in the mines
future, the market is sceptical. Meanwhile,
developmental work is hampered for the want
of air-power for the drills, and ore reserves
are being rapidly depleted. Operations at
the White Hope, are confined to stoping above
the No. 1 level. So far the Kalgoorlie and
Adelaide syndicate- which bought it has not
considered it worth while to prospect below
that depth. On Block 45 Hampton Proper-
ties is mining and crushing, but results to :
date have fallen short of anticipations..
Boulder Perseverance announces that
2,106,266 Is. shares, made up of 4,399,466
ordinaries and 706,800 priority shares, have
been issued by the new co. which took it
over, and that the total cash received in re-
spect of these shares was £l2 253. The old
co. also handed over £5OOO of Treasury bills.
Expenditure to date amounts to £B7O i, leav-
ing £8546 in hand, but preliminary plant-and
mine-overhaul expenses are expected to mop-
up about half of that. Meantime profits from
production arc steadily helping the co.’s bank
account.
One of the first batteries erected on the
Yilgarn field (W.A.) was at Blackburn’s, in
the early ’nineties. The mine was well
opened up and the mainshaft was about the
best on the field. A light 10-head mill soon
proved gold values patchy, and in 1895 the
plant was sold to Fraser’s, five miles to the
north. Recently a returned soldier has
been giving the older show a trial, and at
sft. down he has struck quartz showing gold
freely.
Yilgarn district (W.A.) is still attracting
option-hunters. One Adelaide crowd has
secured a show at Parker’s Range, another
is at Marvel Loch, and several others are
nibbling on the Radio line at Manxman.
Most of the claims are being worked profit-
ably by parties of miners. The old Trans-
vaal mine, near Southern Cross, which con-
tains considerably more, arsenic than gold, is
being unwatered by Victor Leggo and Co.,
while at Burbidge a syndicate of mining men
is busy equipping the Great Victoria, which
is probably the biggest low-grade goldmine
in the State.
* * * *
The old Catherwood, at Kunanalling
(W.A.). is being worked again. In the early
days this show was owned by a London co.
which had an expensive staff quartered mostly
at Coolgardie. Money was spent freely, and
when £20,000 had been used up in surface
scratching and on the staff and directors, the
property was abandoned. A couple of work-
ing-miners are now sinking on stuff carrying
erratic values, but they hope to do better
at depth.
* * * *
Adelaide has become interested in Siberia
(W.A.), where the Paringa and Lanarkshire
have taken options. Hitherto the weaknesses
of the field have been hard ground and im-
poverishment at depth, and from all accounts
the newer work done has given very little
hope of improvement in these respects. Small
share-boosting returns may be obtained, but
sooner or later the public can expect the
announcement that values have cut out.

Westralian Govt. Geologist Gibb Mait-
land has issued a report on the big deposits
of iron-ore in the Tallering Range, on the
Yalgoo goldfield, only a few miles from a
railway and not far from the port of Gerald-
ton. He says that there are millions of
tons available of a grade suitable for the
production of iron and steel, and that cheap
working is assured. Nevertheless, the deposits
will probably lie in reserve for other genera-
tions. Strenuous efforts made in London
last year to raise money to work the im-
mense iron'deposits at Yampi Sound, in the
Nor’-West, failed.

Gt. Boulder (W.A.) has not paid a div.
for over 12 months, and local holders are
wondering when the next one is coming . along.
The profit earned during the period is believed
to be more than sufficient to pay 9d. per
share.

Backers of South Lucknow (N.S.W.) will
not learn much about their luck in the
latest find for a month or more. Conditions
are not favorable for working on the
spur tapped by the crosscut 220 ft. from
the new shaft, and until an air-compressor
is installed driving will proceed along the
contact in search of the continuation of a
spur which promised so well in the work-
ings from the original shaft. The co.’s luck
was in when the new drive went straight
into a spur and definitely located the con-
tact. It had been a long, costly chase to
find the contact. The disclosure of one gold-
bearing spur on it —in the face of the drive
the recently-discovered spur is 2-lft. wude and
assays average about soz the prospects
of locating two others have entirely altered
South Lucknow’s chances. When the old
field was booming such finds would have
created a stir. Usually these spurs carry
rich values only within 25ft. to 30ft. of the
contact, though good patches, usually too
small to work, were often found further
away. Prospecting for the bonanzas on the
contact always proved tricky and very costly,
but the reward was big .when the high values
were located. Whether previous experience
will be repeated in South Lucknow ground,
where most conditions have now definitely
been proved to be identical with those of the
old field, remains for future work to reveal.
South Lucknow must still be considered a
prospecting show with possibilities; all the
work to date—a lot of it wasted, by the
way—has not proved it a mine.
Excepting the Hercules and the_ New Blue
no Bendigo mines were on the div.-list last
year. Hercules had paid £181,394, against
£73,768 called, prior to joining in the' Ben-
digo Amalgamated scheme, and, barring the
Constellation, was the only pup that brought
any grist to the Amalgamated mill. The
existing lease includes Victoria Consols and
the Ironbark. and altogether has produced
£233,000 in divs. against £100.641 called up.
The Sheepshead line of reef is being ex-
. ploited, most of the milling having so far
come from the massive stope formations at
the 1380 ft. The new formation at 1520 ft.
is to be tried in bulk when the shaft has
been deepened.

Barrister Meagher’s final settlement of the
litigation which has been pending respecting
Tongkali Compound's purchase from a
Malayan crowd of the No. 2 ground was on
lines slightly different from those mentioned
last week. The £7OOO being called up by
No. 2 is to pay off that co.’s debt to the Com-
pound, and not a penny of it is to go to the
vendors. Incidentally, the second suction-
cutter dredge under order with the Thomp-
sons, of Castlemaine, is additional plant for
the Compound.

From a Melbourne laboratory:—
Anderson’s Collins House office is out with the Port
Phillip Oil Co., Ltd., which has been promoted to
take over the properties of the Kororoit Oil Co. and
Williarngtown Oil Syndicate; these extend from Gelli-
brand to beyond Laverton, and include rights to bore
in the bay, a la Summerland and Santa Barbara fields
(California). It is more than six months since the Vic.
Mines Department failed to find evidence that the oil
occurring on the Wi liamstown back beach was from
natural near-by sources; but the seepages to-day are
more pronounced than they have ever been, and they
occur only at certain definite spots, where the
basalt covering is fissured and much weathered. The
presence of mixed, base crude-oil in appreciable quan-
tities in an area that has been swept by innumerable
tides indicates a local and continually replenished
source of supply. The deposits in the Williamstown
area are comparatively shallow, but the promoters
declare that they possess everything necessary for
possible oil-pools in the way of porous sands, imper-
vious clays and a sufficiency of original organic mat-
ter to serve as the raw material for petroleum.
Estuarine conditions predominate, and a petroliferous
phase, corresponding to the neighboring lignitic phase,
as exemplified in the Altona brown-coal deposits, is
considered highly probable. The seepage oil is
chemically and physically totally unlike oil that
could be derived by brown-coal distillation, and
the fact that its content of sulphur and nitrogen
approximates that in the Altona coal itself sug-
gests a common original mother substance.
Operations will be guided by J. L. Strevens. A
portable, standard drilling-plant has been secured,
and the first bore will go down immediately on the
Back Beach near the seepages. All structure is masked
by the basalt cover.

“Ponipe”: In many outlying Australian
ports tlio arrival of a steamer invariably
sets a band of thirsty townsmen trailing
shipwards intent on obtaining something
cooler than the local pubs can produce. On
Thursday Island, however, this sociable prac-
tice is likely to sustain a check. Recently
the Victoria blew in from Hong Kong, and
was visited by most of the Island’s pedigree
folk to break the monotony of existence.
Two days later a case of sijiall-pox occurred
on the vessel, and instructions were received
to vaccinate all whose business or pleasure
had taken them on the ship at T.I. The
total roped in came to 80, including one
business man who had rushed aboard to post a
‘letter, and a lady who (so she declared) merely
smiled adieux to her friends from the wharf.
Seventy-nine suspected contacts were well
and truly vaccinated straightway with a

“P.X.”: The Sun’s description of Lord
Leverlmlme’s “large and distinctive head and
tiny and slim body” recalls a story they tell
about him in his part of England. The
Viscount (he was plain Lever then) was
looking for a job for a man he couldn’t him-
self fix up at the moment. He sent him to
a friendly fii’m with a recommendation as a
salesman. A few days later Lever met the
other firm’s manager. “Sorry,” the latter
said —“I couldn’t place that man you sent
me.” “What was the matter with him?”
asked Lever. “Well,” said the other, “did
you look at him? Such a poor little chap—
only about .so high!” “Oh-li-h!” Lever
drawled. “Where I come from we measure

“Amyl” : I can’t specify the most wounded
man I saw during the war, but I have a
vivid recollection of the gamest Digger 1
ever attended. He staggered into my already
overcrowded regimental aidpost at Fromelles
in July, 191t5, with the whole of his chin
blown off, and a ghastly cavity between his
nose and his chest. I dressed him as best 1
could, and wanted him to lie down on a
stretcher and be carried out. He only shook
his head, pointing to his own unwounded
legs and those of some of his mangled cob-
bers stretched out on the floor as if to indi-
cate his conviction that there were others
whose need was greater than his. I knew
better, but I saw, too. that nothing short of
physical violence would have put him on a
stretcher, so in a very husky voice I said
“Orright.” With a cheerful wave to every-
body he staggered out into the inferno again.
The two bearers I detailed off to follow him
told me afterwards that they picked him up
when lie collapsed about 100 yards further
down the sap, and that before they reached
the advanced dressing-station he was dead.

“Merlin”: The death of Judge Gordon lias
been responsible for a curious legal contre-
temps in Adelaide. The Judge had a habit,
which Adelaide had quite got used to, of hav-
ing the whole of the evidence typed, and then
reserving judgment and perusing the case at
his leisure. Which was all very well, and
led to wise decisions. But at his death he
had several cases on hand, and those cases
are sub judice, and will remain so until the
Judge’s ghost rises again. So that is the
end of them, and in the present state of the
law they cannot be re-tried. All documents
and exhibits handed in have to remain in
court, and can only be taken out for refer-
ence on condition that they are returned.
The curious thing is that one litigant had
been caught in the same way over the death
of the late C.-J. Way, and, knowing Gordon’s
habits, asked that the other side’s copy of
an important document be handed in. He
still has his document, while the other side's
copy is in court till Doomsday.

“S.T.S.”: Where Stopford, of Queensland,
makes the big mistake in his official pro-
nouncement that prisoners are under no obli-
gation to stay in gaol if they can get out is
in ignoring the effect this must have if it
“gets about” and is acted on. It will de-
stroy at one blow the comfort of prisoners.
The decent gaoler of this age—and the decent
type is greatly increasing—takes a pride in
seeing what harmless pleasures he can allow
his wards, and how far he can trust them;
and they mostly respond by playing the
game, and seeing their time out in such modi-
fied comfort as they can get. The ideal is to
work up to practically no restrictions at all,
the prisoners being on their honor not to
try to escape; and in some cases —notably
in America—it is being very nearly realised.
However, the gaoler is a gaoler, first of all,
and his plain duty is to neglect no precau-
tions that will prevent escapes ; otherwise his
reputation is gone, and possibly his job. He
can checkmate the propensity all right, even
in the most determined cases, by using all
the resources which of late years he has
come to loathe. He holds the thick end of
the stick. So every prison dreads any escape,
because precautions are at once revived and
privileges withdrawn. The Stopford idea of
not expecting any implied parole means
simply a long step backward into barbarous
and outworn methods.

Note from a country surgery:—
Don’t you believe it when they tell you that, in
consequence of the crowds “going up” for medicine
in these days, the young doctor doesn’t get the
training he used to have in midwifery. Conditions,
as a matter of fact, have enormously improved;
and well they might. In Sydney, down even to twelve
or fifteen years ago, a man to qualify had to attend a
certain number of lectures and be present at a
dozen confinements at an approved maternity hos-
pital. Of teaching at the hospital there was abso-
lutely none. There was, I believe, a resident at
the hospital I attended, but I never saw him. Like-
wise, I never saw a member of the honorary staff,
nor did I see instruments used or an anesthetic
given. With this exiguous training I was let loose
on the public. Later on I w T as locum tenens for a
medical friend, and was called to a maternity case,
in which, after consideration, I judged instrumental
interference necessary. Having had no experience
in the use of such things, I had in a senior man
in consultation, who rapidly did what was required.
I asked him how he had learnt the job. “Oh, I
just used to bung ’em on,” said he. So thereafter
I bunged ’em on, and fortunately found the diffi-
culties not insuperable. Nowadays the hospitals are
very much larger, and hence can accommodate a
greater number of students at a time; moreover, the
students “live in," and not in any bug-ridden board-
ing-house near the hospital that happens to have a
telephone. The advantages of actually residing in
the hospital must be apparent to anyone, and, more-
over, special tutors have been appointed to take
charge of the practical side, and students are com-
pelled to attend a greater number of eases than was
necessary a few years back. Certainly far too many
women still die as the immediate result of child-

birth. But you will never be without deaths so long
as the little Australian arrives in dwellings where
it is impossible to achieve complete asepsis. The
writer, in common with probably every other doctor, ,
has repeatedly been in dwellings where there was
not even a change of bed-linen and hardly a basin.
And then there is the Gamp, whom a weak-kneed
Government still permits, with or without a medical
man, to minister to women in their trouble. It is
sufficient to say that this branch of medicine, which,
from a national point of view, is the most important,
is the only one in which an unqualified person is
allowed to practice. Here, indeed, is work for the
National Council of Women to do.

“Akran”: Re Lord Kitchener's death. The
Huns in the trenches at Bois Grenier cer-
tainly knew of it before we did. We were
within throwing range of the enemy’s lines,

ing of the Hampshire we were .speculating
about the cause of rejoicing in Fritz’s
trenches. A note came over that evening on
a bit of shell. It read: “Now the war will
soon be over. Come over here unarmed and
you’ll have a good time.” The same bit of
iron bore back a reply: ‘’Come over here,
armed or unarmed, and you’ll get a of

stocked condition of our commissariat by

From the Office Savonarola: —
Every calling sets its impress on those who follow
it, and in none does the rule apply more than in the
politician’s trade. The social, if not moral, deteriora-
tion is speedier and more obvious even than in the
bookmaking business, which may cause its votaries
to become noisy and blatant, but does not make
nuisances of them in the circles they frequent, and
which produces many drinkers but few drunkards.
Drinking is so much a consequence of the poli-
tician’s life that few but practising teetotallers
escape from alcoholism after a few years in Parlia-
ment. One present-day Ministry contains three
prominent members who might fairly be described
as habitual inebriates, and at least two others who
drink harder than 90 per cent, of business men.
As to the habits of the rank and file in most of
our Parliaments, let Hansard speak; and it should
be remembered that these abusive persons represent
only the fraction who get “na3ty” when drunk.
Listening to them in fuddled disapproval (sit or
lie) many lawmakers who are no less under the
influence because liquor moves them to speechless
benignity.
No quality is more prized in any station in life
than modesty. A tendency to skite is the first social
failing that boys detect and chastise, and it is one
of the hardest defects to forgive in old age. Queen
Victoria detested Gladstone chiefly because, as she
said, he talked to her as though she was a public
meeting. The youngest, politician is capable of
picking' up this abominable trick after a few months
in the” House, and, though he may have an exiguous
vocabulary and nothing of worth to say, be can be
trusted to make a pest of himself in private for as
long as he remains before the public. Actors aie,
of course, insufferable bores, and actresses aid worse;
but they are not the oratorical, long-winded variety
of the curse. Pugilists, jockeys, amateur-professional
tennis-players, cricketers, swimmers, etc., are all
frankly vain and self-sufficient, but they boast little,
are abstemious in the nature of things, and look
no more objectionable in the mass than the average

SLEEPING OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The march of stars is o’er my head;
They swing across the skies,
And music, matching - to their tread,
Swells for a space and dies,
As on the strings the earth affords
The wind’s soft: lingers strike their chords.
My weary eyelids drowsing now,
Come woodland sprites to me ;
Their kisses coolly touch my brow
In thrills of ecstasy ;
With mighty epic dreams a-leap
My senses float to realms of sleep.
Beneath no roof shall I be pent,
In narrow walls confined,
But with the purple skies my tent,
The veil of night my blind,
Kissed by the winds, I’ll make my bed,
The march of stars above my head.

“Ring-off” : “Cartot” (B. 27/12/’23) errs
regarding the P.M.G.'s “listeners-in” to tele-
phone conversations. The practice was not
introduced as a war measure; nor has it ever
been employed except, when there are allega-
tions of over-charges for calls, and then only
at the written request of the subscriber con-
cerned. In that case, a os. guarantee is
duly refunded if the test shews reasonable
grounds for the subscriber’s, complaint.
Shorthand reports of conversations are not
made —merely long-hand notes of opening
remarks, sufficient to establish authenticity
of the messages, etc. Incidentally, these
tests almost invariably vindicate the
Department’s records, providing the sub-
scriber plays the game and keeps the
fact of the test to himself. If he does this he
is usually rewarded by the disclosure that
unauthorised use is being made of the tele-
phone whenever lie happens to be absent, or
out of hearing of the instrument.

“Penman” : I was a member of the Graves
Detachment which exhumed and reburied
soldiers’ bodies that lay in scattered graves
in and around Villers-Bret. A fair pro-
portion of our harvest was labelled “Un-
known.” A large number of bodies, how-
ever, were identified by minute examinations,
and correctly named on the temporary
wood ('n crosses placed over their second
graves. A memorable incident occurred
when one of our parties came upon a cross
marked “Unknown British Soldier.” Two
bodies were exhumed. Both were dressed in
artillery uniform, but one was a woman.
The matter was duly reported to the War
Office, and there the matter ended so far as
we were concerned. But what little

“777”: “Blanc” (B. 22/11/’23j tells of
the well-tended grave of a British airman
in a German cemetery, and asks whether
flowers were planted on any German graves
on French soil. There were numerous well-
conditioned Boche graves on the Allies’ side
of the line; one in particular I remember
for the unique honor that was paid to a
dead enemy. When Baron von Richthofen,
the Hun Ace, with 80 victories to his credit,
was brought down on 21/4/1918 at Bonnay,
on the Somme, he was laid to rest in an
oaken coffin with full military honors in the
little French civil cemetery at Bertangles,
just north of Amiens. Boche colors and a
mass of flowers and foliage decorated the
grave, and a propeller fashioned in the form
of a cross stood at the head. In marked con-
trast was the Hun’s tribute to those superb
airmen Guynemer and Ball. Both were
brought down in No-Man’s Land, and Fritz
batteries did their work of destruction so
thoroughly that in neither case was a single
trace ever found of man or machine.

“Hanno”: The origin of the preference
often exhibited by magistrates for police
testimony when it conflicts with lay evi-
dence (B. 27/12/’23) wasn't wholly bad : In
the early days of Victoria and N. S. Wales
the Department was in the habit of calling
a policeman .to account when his testimony
was rejected by the Bench. There was even
a time when a constable who had been
branded as unworthy of belief by a court
of law ran a serious risk of losing his job.
Magistrates knew this, and it is not alto-
gether to their discredit that, when there had
been hard swearing on both sides, the con-
sideration sometimes tipped the beam in the
policeman’s favoi\ But there is no reason
why it should nowadays.

“Bricky”: An alleged syndicate in an
Australian capital is busy running up cot-
tages for sale on easy terms. The syndicate
consists of a Welshman who got his experi-
ence in Liverpool, which, as everybody in
those parts knows, is the capital of Wales.
A brother-Welshman came to visit him lately;
and together they went to have a look over
some of the new mansions. “David John,”
said the builder, “you stay here while I go
into the next cottage.” (This was a semi-
detached pair.) “David John,” said the
builder from the other side of the partition,
“can you hear me!” “Yes, I can hear you,
Thomas William.” “But, David John, can
you see me?” “No, Thomas William, I
cannot see you.” “You cannot see me, David
John ! Ah, there’s a wall for you !”
“Safran”: Nothing is more
surprising than the recurrent
outbursts of surprise when a
crime of violence throws a lurid
light on the private lives of
film stars. Here are people
who a few years ago were wait-
ers, chambermaids and so
forth. Many of them are un-
educated to the point of illit-
eracy ; others are Polish and
Levantine Jews who know no
language intimately but Yid-
dish. The nouveau riche of the
past, from Trimalchio to Sir
Gorgius Midas, has been elderly
or old, with most of his fire
quenched in fat and pride.
Film stars become suddenly
rich when they are young—no
calling in the world’s history
has produced so many dollar
millionaires under 30 —and
they have no traditions save the
glory of love-making and cham-
pagne-drinking. The rest in-
evitably follows—that is to say,
drunken orgies, promiscuity and
jealous brawls. A considerable
percentage of these public idols
develop into drug addicts, and
presently corrupt the chauf-
feurs. ladies’ maids, butlers,
valets and other attendants who
participate in their revels. The
Yankee millionaire, as satirised
on the British and Continental
stage a quarter of a century
ago, was at the worst a whole-
some vulgarian: the plutocrats
of the film, male and female,
are usually neurotic criminals.
Never has civilisation had
clearer proof of the fact that
it is far easier to learn how to
make money than the delicate
art of spending it.
“Weasel”: In these days when tiny craft
are beginning to venture all around the
Seven Seas it is worth recalling that one of
the most remarkable voyages ever made
across the Pacific was that of a 10-ton yacht
belonging to Dr. Nixon, the first Anglican
bishop of the Speck. That cockleshell went
from Hobart Town to San Francisco as long
ago as 1849. The Bishop did not go with

Hall and three others, who reckoned that
they would like to go gold-digging m Cali-
fornia. Hall wrote to the Bishop after-
wards telling him how well the yacht be-
haved. He also apologised for the liberty
that he had taken, and explained that
nothing but urgent necessity would have
driven him to make free with a bishop’s
property.

might do something to keep
their carriages from being

man can drown himself in a
mixture of beer, brandy and
turps for all I can', but I object
when the orgy is carried on at
close range. On a recent 0.10

five hogs emptied a sackful of
bottles, and the corridor car-

people of mixed sexes reeked
with the smell of their pota-

and other complainants wouldn t

acute it was my misfortune to cross the

in the charge of a resuscitated “Tommy

its lines than he made it patent by his
fidgeting that this was the nearest lie had
ever been to the enemy. It was a still night
and a placid sea, and old Fuzz-Buzz seemed
to be on tenterhooks lest our loudly-voiced

from the remotest

The gratuity people
are particularly
puzzled regarding a
world-wanderer who
first wrote from Daw-

ing indignantly why
he had not been noti-
fied of the gratuity,
and demanding that
he should be “fixed

evidence of his exist-

ing why no notice hau

his postal address as

cated his intention of
making trouble if he
had to return to Syd-
ney to get his dues.
His next letter came,
months later, from

Buenos Aires: after
which an epistle bear-
ing signs of having

tirade about the

came into the war a camp in England was
formed so that Diego could be initiated into
the mysteries of British army drill. Tommies
from the surrounding camps used to wander

they regarded as better than a circus; and
ultimately an “order” was issued prohibiting
the Tommies from laughing at the Portu-
guese, and intimating that any breach would
be regarded -as a serious offence.

Littleton Groom's father represented Too-
woomba in the Queensland Parliament for
40 years, during 10 of which he was Speaker
of the Leg. Assembly. He died in 1901, a
few months after he had become member for
the Darling Downs in the first Federal Par-
liament. Lit. succeeded him, and has repre-
sented the same constituency ever since.
Thus father and son have been Parliamen-
tary reps, of the district for 63 successive
years. The youngest son, Leslie, has kept
aloof from politics, preferring to earn his
crust in the law. He was a solicitor in Bris-
bane and Toowoomba for over 20 years,
and recently bought a practice in Sydney.
The Toowoomba Chronicle has been in the
hands of the Grooms for upwards of 50
years; which perhaps helps to explain why
they have also been able to keep the Parlia-
mentary seat in the family.
A man who has written the name of every
citizen born in N. S. Wales during the last
17 years is retiring from his job. He is

who has been
“clerk in charge of

Births, Deaths and

of the Registrar-
General’s office for

was in the service
for a score of years
before he got that
post. It takes one

work of the Stork

betical registering

BARWELL,
Premier of S. Aus-
tralia, who is
marshalling his
forces for a general
election.
Unlike Vic., which hasn’t a single retired
Agent-General alive (B. 10/l/’24), West-
ralia can show half a dozen. Actually the
only ex-A.-G. for Groperland who has passed
out is the first of his line, Malcolm Fraser,
who field the job from ’92 to 97. Ned
Wittenoom, who came next, is President of
the W.A. Leg. Council nowadays. Lefroy,
who followed Wittenoom. was Premier a few
years back, but, since liis constituents re-
jected him, finds squatting more congenial
than politics. Walter James pursues Costs
in Perth, and occasionally takes the plat-
form on behalf of other candidates at election
time. Hector Rason is a company director
in London. Newton Moore, who had a seat
in the House of Commons till the other day,
is also in the guinea-pig line. James D.
Connolly, who passed over the office keys
to Colebatch last year, follows liis two pre-
decessors’ example by remaining in the U.K.,
though he retains a considerable stake in
W.A. Altogether, the Westralian Agency-
General seems to have been a salubrious job
for all the politicians who have “chased each
other through the Zodiac like Taurus chases
Aries.”
Eric Conran, whose death is reported from
London, was one of the few Australian bird-
men in the army of Mons and the Marne.
He learned to fly for the fun of it, but joined
the Royal Air Force on the outbreak of war,
and served throughout the 1914 campaign.
In the last of several crashes his skull was
fractured, and on emerging from hospital he
was placed on the instructional stall’. Eric
was the only son of 11. L. Conran, known
in Capella (C.Q.) as a pastoralist, in Adel-
aide as a sharebroker, and in Perth as an in-
vestor with newspaper interests. The two
Conran girls (they used to be close friends
of the German Crown Princess) have married
into the British aristocracy.

Passed out, at 77,
Alexander Busby,
last surviving son
of Dr. Georg.?
Busby, the pioneer
medico of Bathurst.
Dr. Busby was
Colonial Surgeon
in the ’thirties: his widow died a
wliilq back on the bank of the Jordan
Creek, which runs through Bathurst, at 93.
The late Alexander was manager of the
Bathurst branch of the Commercial Bank
of Sydney for many years.
John Longstaff’s dad, who died at Shep-
parton ( Vic.) a few weeks back, left £16,600,
of which John will get a good whack.
Crossed the Great Divide. A.C.O. Lane,
a descendant of the N. S. Wales pioneering
Lane family. Ilis grandparent, William,
was one of the first settlers to cross the
Blue Mountains, closely following the foot-
steps of Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth.
The site selected was known subsequently as
Orton Park station —acquired by the Mc-
Phillamy family from his son Charles Lane.
Charles then migrated west to Orange and
established the first western rural industry—
a soap-manufacturing works. On his demise
A.C.O. successfully conducted it for 44 years.
Now the fourth generation—lrvine Lane-
watches over a flourishing business.
John Angus, of Gregra, Molong (N.S.W.),
who recently proceeded furthest west, was
born, along with a twin brother, at Bum-
baldry station, near Cowra, 86 years ago.
On the day he passed over, his twin brother
in Queensland did likewise.
George Lansbury, the editor of London
Daily Herald, who seems certain of a
Cabinet post if Ramsay Macdonald wins to
power, came to Australia as a settler with
his wife and three children in the ’eighties.
But they seemed to pine for their native fog
and scurried home within a year. Lansbury
is the pioneer in the Labor campaign for the
recognition of Russia.
Edward Cook, who has just footed it across
Australia from Melbourne to Pt. Darwin,
recalls a pioneer at the business, Jerome
•T. Murif. Cook got. tired of running a detec-
tive agency in Adelaide, and wanted to do
something with a thrill in it; so he over-
landed by way of Mildura, Broken Hill,
Tibooburra and Oodnadatta, picking up
mates and dropping them on the road, and
finished the trip in seven months. Murif
was an enginedriver at Stephens Creek, on
the Barrier, when he had his little outburst,
in the early, days of the pneumatic push-
bike, and he plodded through without any
companion from Glenelg (Adelaide) to Dar-
win. But whereas Cook is quite prepared
to lecture about his doings, beyond putting
his experiences into a little book Murif was
much too shy to ever mention his remarkable
bit of genuine pioneering.
Prendergast and Lemmon, leader and sec.
respectively of Vic. Parliamentary Labor
party, have got walkovers in the pre-selec-
tions for their seats (N. Melbourne, and
Williamstown). Rogers, the party Whip, is
retiring when Parliament dissolves, as his
health is crumbling. J. W. Billson, deputy-
leader, is having no trouble with pre-selec-
tion for Fitzroy, but he is anything but
robust. Bailey (Fort Fairy j looks like a
leader of the future, but he will find it diffi-
cult to get by Ned Ilogan (Warrenheip).
Ted Cotter, whose safe seat (Richmond) is
coveted by two other comrades, is not fear-
ful of the result. Though at times he has
been a trifle too persistent in the Assembly,
he has acquired a status equal at least to
that held by George Bennett, and it would
take either of bis rivals a long time to
acquire so strong a pull.
From an old Parliamentary hand :
If Stanley Argyll;, Vic. Chief Sec., thinks the
game worth the candle, and plays his cards with
judgment, lie may win the Premiership within three
years. There must be some Liberal alternative to
Lawson. Peacock may continue to be a first lieuten-
ant, but is not fancied as captain. Eggleston has
not arrived. McPherson has gone to the pack.
Allan is impossible—for the No. 1 job, at any rate.
Argyle will find it necessary, if lie would be First
Minister, to shed some of his conservatism, and to
accept the advice which Murray Smith gave to Watt,
but which Watt did not follow, “to suffer fools
gladly.”
Hyman Herman, head of the Vic. Elec-
tricity Commission’s research work, has
gained liis D.Sc. at 'Melb. Uni. He is a
trier, and won’t: allow himself to be anchored
in any stagnant shallow. Formerly he was
an assistant on the geological staff of the
Mines Department. As the outlook was not
encouraging he threw up his job and took. a
more remunerative one with a private co. in
the Speck. Later he returned to the Mines
Dept, as director of geological survey, and
was one of the small committee that recom-
mended to the second Peacock Government
the opening up of Morwell brown-coal field.
Naturally, when the Elec. Commission took
hold, it collared Herman from the Mines
Dept., at £lOOO a year or thereabouts, to
help make the project go.
“Newport”: Besides John L. Potter, of
Timaru (M.L.), there is another survivor of
the first Eight Hours procession in Mel-
bourne in 1856 —Richard Honeycombe, of
Footscray, aged 92, and still going strong.
He has missed only three processions since
the first, but now marches in a motor.
Died at Goondiwindi (Q.) last month,
aged 89, Thomas Hitcliener, who came to
Australia in 1869 and, settling at Tamworth
(N.S.W.), ran the mail service to Warialda.
Thereby he twice made the acquaintance of
Thunderbolt, and had to witness the rifling
of his mail. Later he went grazing, and
carried on till two years ago.
Central and West Bananaland has lost
11. J. Sealy, one of its pioneers and a man
prominent in local public affairs. Born in
Ipswich (Q. ) in 1858, lie did one thing and
another until he settled down at Kyneton,
and won fame as a breeder and good judge
of horses, and, in less measure, of cattle
and sheep. His mare Mernette won the first
C.Q. Derby, and other horses of his have
raced successfully in the south.
While William Mcßeatli. who left by the
Narkunda, is having a nine months’ trip
abroad, Maj.-Gen. McCay will be acting-
chairman of Vic. Savings Bank Commis-
sioners. ,Hp will draw only his screw as
an ordinary commissioner (£5OO a year).
McCay has declined to take anything for
his organisation and command work in con-
nection with the special constabulary. A
lawyer refusing money for work connected
with the maintenance of law and order!
From Richard Pinkerton, of Yandina
Apropos the death of the last of the Pinkertons,
the heads of the great detective agency of N. York
and elsewhere, here is the story of the founder of
the firm, Alan Pinkerton, as told me years ago
by my late father, R. Campbell Pinkerton, of North
Sydney, who was closely associated with his cousin.
Alan, a small tenant farmer in Scotland, had the
ambition to become a freeholder, so left for America,
where land was to be had on easy terms. He
selected a section in Illinois, and on his way out
to his block overtook a countryman of his, whom
he asked to join the party. The young Scot agreed,
and worked for Alan for two years. Now, Alan
was a collector of Scottish coins, and was proud of
his gatherings. He was away from home for three
weeks on one occasion, and on his return found
both his man and the coins missing. Alan deter-
mined to follow as soon as he could fix things up
at home; the pursuit lasted for 18 months, but
ended successfully in New York. At the trial the
Judge warmly complimented Alan, and said it was
a pity for him to remain farming, as he was wanted
in If’York. That set him thinking. Very soon he
disposed of his interests in Illinois, opened up at
New York and lived to employ some 800 or 900
people. Incidentally, he and my father died on the
same day, July 1, 1886 —one in Australia, the
other in New York.
The “Honorable Jimmy” Blair was a popu-
lar and capable figure in the Queensland
Parliament for 14 years, and at various
times was Acting-Premier, Attorney-General
and Minister for Mines. Then lie lost his
JUDGE BLAIR (Q.).
seat during a serious illness when the Ryan
Government came into power in 1:915. As
soon as he. could he returned to his law books,
and from his front place at the Queensland
Bar stepped up to the Bench a couple of
years ago. At present he is in charge of the
Central Queensland Supreme Court, and
Rockhampton is his headquarters.
A man who died at Paddington (Sydney)
recently had seven children by his first wife,
all sons; by his second wife he had six chil-
dren, all daughters. Two of the first family
have had four children each, all boys; and
the eldest of the daughters has three children,
all girls.
Seventy-one of the 1800 estate-agents regis-
tered under the new Vic. Act are skirted —
just about 4 p.c. Some are widows and
daughters of men who had built up busi-
nesses, but others have plunged in from out-
side. Only one petticoated auctioneer, Elsie
OTlalloran, is licensed in the State. She
has 900 trousered rivals.
Hector Ross, the Speck’s Sheriff, is retir-
ing from the job after 24 years of it. He was
a mathematical master at Queen’s College,
Hobart, in his earlier days. He is now 70,
and is proposing to spend the rest of his life
at his country home at Cambridge, whence
he has travelled almost every morning during
the last 10 years. Twice he had to stay in
town overnight because he had appointments
in the early morning which he could not
have kept otherwise. Ross will be succeeded
by his understudy Kemp.
‘‘Yoyang”: Lieut. Joshua John Moore’s
letter of 1826, wherein he applies to pur-
chase 1000 acres at Canberry (there is a
full-page reproduction of it in the “Journal
of the R. Aus. Hist. Society” for 1923), con-
tains the earliest recorded mention of the
name of the Federal capital. Moore was a
half-pay lieutenant of the 14th Foot, who
came to Sydney with Judge-Advocate John
Wylde in 1816, and was Registrar of the
Court and clerk to Wylde, his brother-in-
law. Later he became Prothonotary of the
newly-established Supreme Court. He left that
job to become a settler at Horningsea, Cab-
ramatta, and in course of time acquired
further grants of land at Baw Baw (near
Goulburn) and Canberry. He died at Baw
Baw in ’64, aged 74.
Dr. W. E. Jones, who lias been Inspector-
General of the Insane in Vic. for 19 years,
has been appointed for another five years.
Marrying an Australian girl helped to Aus-
tralianise him, and his home principality
(Wales), is only a memory. The Vic. Fores-
try Department is also ruled by a Jones
(Owen), also from Wales. Nobody has ever
seen either with a portrait of Lloyd George
or Billy Hughes in his office.
PERTINACIOUS PUSSY.

Spite of attempts to mar;
Add to the laurels on Pussyfoot’s brow

Though half-blind and husky,
He captured the dusky
Old Sultan; so Zanzibar's dry,

The Sultan of Zanzibar's dry.
Bumpers of water to Pussyfoot’s health!
Wish him the best of luck!
Faint-hearted boozers may wallow in wealth —
Pussyfoot’s richer in pluck.
Such pluck I delight in,
He’s happy when fightin’;
This bird, a fair demon to try,

“I do hear tell that boay Johnny Treyear do ’ave the

"'E maake a praieher (snort,)! Why ’e used to live
next door to we."
■‘Strenuous" : We heard a good deal awhile
back about horses that couldn’t or wouldn’t swim;
how’s this for one that would ? Years ago one
Cadell was up among the Islands with a cargo of
horses. What he was doing with them I don’t know;
but for some reason he landed them on an island
which proved to be waterless. He left enough in
casks to keep them alive till he came back, and
sailed off. On his return he found that the blacks
had pinched the hoops from the casks, and the
horses were dead—all but one, and neither he nor
his carcase could he found. G’adell’s vessel by this
time was getting short of water, so they called in
for some at. another island about 10 miles away.
And there the first thing they found was the missing
horse, looking none the worse for his 10-mile swim.
Incidentally, this same prad was once stolen by the
Clark gang. When found a day or so later he
was nearly Read. He had been ridden to a stand-
still in a saddle with a broken cantle, which had
eaten a big hole into his shoulder; but there
wasn’t a spur mark on him.
“Ponipg”: They are taught quite good
manners on some of our Cape York (Q.) mission
stations. I landed on the beach near the Kendall
River awhile back, and all was excitement while
I was handing out the usual half-stick of tobacco
to all and sundry. Presently a 16-year-old Venus
came charging over a sandhill, not even dressed in
the customary six inches of loincloth. She had
her mission frock in her hand, but it was quite
forgotten until she was within five yards of us.
Then she suddenly remembered her manners. Smil-
ingly she pulled the frock on and held out her
hand for her share of the baccy.

“Blue Bar”: “Pick” (B. 27/12/’23) is
right when he says that hawks do not attack smaller
birds that are massed together. The one prayer of
the convoyers of racing pigeons is that; if hawks
arc about —and they mostly are—the released birds
will stick together. The hawks know the pigeon
baskets on the railway platform, and will hang round
tor hours waiting for the start. The marauders at
Binalong (N.S.W.) are famous for this; some of
them have even had names given them by the con-
voyers, who swear they can recognise them. When
the pigeons arc released they generally go off in
one big mob, with the killers tailing on behind.
After the first few miles the stragglers begin to
<h op to the rear, and the hawks have the time of
their lives. But they have never been known to
attack the mob.

“Topee”: Cane suitable for basket work
(B. 13/12/’23) grows abundantly along the lore-
shores between Raluana and Cape Gazelle, in the
Rabaul district (ex-German New Guinea). One of
ihe late Ifokopo garrison was an expert, basket
maker, and had a fine gold medal won in a compe-
tition connected with the craft. He showed me canes
running along for hundreds of feet, and explained
how the various vines could be utilised, with methods
of collection, preparation, packing, etc.; but he
reckoned the cost of getting the stuff to Rabaul and
heavy freight to Sydney would be too great to make it
north while. Still, he thought local companies with
their own small craft ought to find it payable to
collect the stuff as a sideline. He added that he
had been frozen out of a small factory by larger
concerns, but, if he were single, would be strongly
tempted to give it a fly.

Veronal : Tlie binghis of Tasmania lmd
an idea that when a devil took up
its baneful abode in their bodies it
might be exorcised by smearing the
iace with the ashes of a dead person.
An 1843 writer on the affairs of
the Speck got an account from an
ove-witness of the exorcism cere-
mony. Among a number of abos.
lying sick of the devil aforesaid, a
woman died. The body was laid on flat
stones and piled over with brushw 7 OC(i
and timber, and the pyre set alight.
As each part of the body became
reduced to ashes, these were col-
lected in a piece of kangaroo skin,
and thereafter every morning before
sunrise a handful of the ashes was
smeared over the faces of the sick
people to the accompaniment of
weird chanting. This was supposed
to give the devils their walking
tickets; but it is not recorded how
many left the premises.

“Cortot": Not long ago a
man in the N.S.W. North Coast,
whose dog (which he had bred and
reared) slept on the verandah just
outside his door, was awakened in the
night by being savagely attacked by
the animal, which tried to seize him
by the throat and actually inflicted
severe wounds on his hands and
arms. It was only with the utmost
difficulty that it was finally beaten
off. Next morning the dog, a hand-
some collie, seemed thoroughly ashamed
of his outburst, and was apparently
just as much attached to the
owner as ever. Curiously enough, in
all the three years of its life the dog
had never been known to display so
much as bad temper, let alone
ferocity.
“Ponipe”: A young abo. who came to
Thursday Island a while back developed a new philo-
sophy, which, besides possessing the odor of sanctity,
has a decided Bolshevik flavor. He got a job as
house-boy, and on the first Sunday morning he
seemed to be taking things so easy that he was told
to hurry up with his customary duties. Binghi
looked astonished and calmly informed madame:
“I can’t work on Sundays; I belong God,” and
strolled off. The boss was informed, and when his
wrath had spent itself in a few well-chosen remarks,
he devised a counter attack. After an hour’s wait
for the summons to ki-ki, which did not come,
Binghi shoved into the kitchen and intimated that
he was hungry. Thereupon he was told that the
family also belonged God on Sundays. The boy
walked away with a “trumped my ace’* look on
his face and sulked for the rest of the morning.
About midday the dusky religionist caved in. He
turned up at the kitchen door and announced an
unconditional surrender. But he did it with an
air. “Missis, missis,” he called, “I cut wood now!
I do anything! I forgive you, missis!”
“Jarrah”: Someone suggested in a recent
Bulletin that dogs that dig for water might have
a dingo strain. The trick is not confined to those
with warrigal blood in them. With a pure-bred
Scotch collie I was recently travelling an arid
patch of W.A., when my waterbaer ran dry. Thirst
A SAFETY CLUTCH.
THE BRIDEGROOM: “I say, parson, could yer drop in a bit about the
bride not bringin ’ ’er ma to the house?"
was making its presence felt rather badly, when the
dog ran down a gully and started digging in a
patch of sand below some rocks. After scooping
out a hole about a foot deep he lay down and
watched. I watched too; and soon the longed-for
liquid made its appearance.
“Blue Bar”: If “Saaedi” (B. 27/12/’23)
will visit the Sydney Museum he will see two or
three examples of the nests of diamond-sparroW3
built in the homes of large birds. The official
explanation is that the diamonds, who are famous
for these queer building habits, know they are
safe from smaller hawks when they build in the
basement of a wedge-tailed eagle’s domicile. The
eagle evidently considers them beneath his notice—
and they are blissfully aware of it.
* * * *
“F.A.” ; “Jacky Roo” (B. 27/12/ ? 23), in
support of his predilection for the breast-plate as
compared with the collar, quotes the fact that the
former is used by the artillery. But of all known
methods of haulage by animal power that of th<
Army is the least economical. No civilian outfit
would stand the racket of six half-draught horses
to a 35cwt. pull. In civilian quarters two horses
would be used for a job of that size. Breast harness
is essentially equipment for light draught work, and
anyone who knows the part of a prad’s anatomy
that is most useful for hauling will agree that the
breast-plate doesn’t bring that part into action. The
introduction of the breast harness into the Army
was a matter of military exigency rather than
utility. A collar takes some looking after and then
doesn’t wear well, while the simplicity of the other
makes it a fool-proof piece of equipment. The
fault in the breast-plate does not lie in its inter-
ference with the horse’s breathing; that is a matter
of simple adjustment. The trouble comes at the
point of the shoulder, which is harder to clear.
* * • *
“Octavius Onion” (Tas.) : I should like
to oontribute my quota to the shooting-from-horseback
controversy. There is a 15-year-old youth in Middle
Swan (W.A.) who can place a kerosene-tin on a
fence post, and, while galloping past, about 25 yards
distant, will hit the tin nine times out of ten with
rifle, gun or revolver. Incidentally, most of the shooting
in the Gormanston district of Tasmania (and shooting
is the premier sport) is done from horseback. This
applies, of course, to large game only.
* * * *
“Cobba Cobba”: Re the endurance of
Binghi. On one prospecting trip Ross and Sloan
had the services of a Laura (Q.) nig. as horseboy,
etc. Failing to remove a wet charge from a shotgun,
Sloan laid the weapon close to the camp fire. The
subsequent explosion drove the wooden ramrod —left
thoughtlessly in the barrel—through the foot of the
abo., who was reclining some distance away. Although
he fainted twice during the rough bush surgical
methods employed in removing the rod, the injured
nig. had disappeared when the prospectors awoke the
following morning. Four days later he limped into
the police-station at the Laura, over 200 miles away,
with rough N. Queensland bush country intervening,
and told the sergeant that, because he had let the
gun get wet, Sloan had tried to shoot him.
“R.F.K.F.”: Drought provides some un-
usual fishing in the
chains of waterholes < f
N. Queensland. Wattle
pods, soaked and left
for some hours to
mature, give off a
smellful effluvia as
horrible as the sul-
phuretted hydrogen
with which the chemi-
cal beginner astonishes
his lay friends. Long-
ago the natives of the
Gulf used this wattle-
pod brew to stupef.v
ftsh left in the smaller
holes of summer-
stricken streams, and
the idea is carried out
■ to-day by young Aus-
tralians. After the bag-
of pods has been in
the water for an hour
or two, all hands jump
in and churn up the
dope until the fish come
gasping to the surface
and are easily caught.
(They soon recover in
a bath of fresh water.)
I want to kn o w
whether this method,
which works so well
with the smaller fish,
could be used for the
capture of the so-
called fresh-water
sharks that sometimes
travel on the flood far
up the Gulf streams
and then get marooned
by drought in an iso-
lated waterhole. These
barricaded rovers seem
to lose their predatory,
habits for the time
being and live in amity
with other denizens of
the hole; but I think
they are too tough,
even in their emaciated
state of semi-captivity,
to cave in to the fumes
of wattle-pod stink bombs.

“J.A.A.”: I can nominate a. member of
the Council who 10 years ago was—and probably
still is-—at least as great a BuLLETiN-ite as “Back
Block’s” Westralian cobber, Old Bill Carson (B.
20/12/’23). This is Boniface McGowan, then of
Ulverstone (Tas.), now, I believe, of Hobart. McGowan
had read every Bulletin from cover to cover from
Vol. I No. 1 onward. Moreover, his most treasured
possession was a complete file bound in leather.
No Bulletin enthusiast that I have ever ran across
(and I’ve met a few) could hold a candle to
McGowan for his interest in the history of the
Red ’Un and its personnel, past and present, and
HE PROVED IT.
THE COMFORTER: “So Jones ran away with
your wife? And he teas your best
friend!"
THE COMFORTER: “Yes, a good fellow.
Jones!"
I'm prepared to bet the National Debt to the N.S.W.
Sinking Fund that he lias every copy of the paper
that has been issued since I saw him last. Inci-
dentally, complete sets of The Bulletin must be
rare. Does the Council know where one can be
obtained, and, approximately, for what sum?

THE OLD SHEDS AND THE NEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'Ve rolled our swags in a river bend,
U here nestled a small bush town.
And we went far out where the fences end
Ere the winter floods came down.
When the feed was good we had bush-b-ed hacks—
We knew all the well-grassed glades ,
And a racer might carry the shearers’ packs
W hen the sheep were shorn with blades.
fhe woolsheds then were of slabs and bark,
With a plain little homestead near ;
And the squatter worked from the dawn till dark
With the will of the pioneer.
It was we who fought for the lame dog then,
Stood solid in each big row;
Rut what have you done for the old blade men
With your boasted union now?
Gone are the days of the Shearers’ Cup,
Forgotten the cut-out ball :
Forgotten the sports ere we saddled up
To make for the . next roll call.
Now the shearing’s done on a contract plan
By men with a slick machine ;
They have no time left for the fast blade man-
lie is only an old has-been!
They pack their swags on the city side
In a port, and suit-case too ;
On well-known roads in a car they glide
To sheds on the far Paroo;
Hut they need not jeer at the man they meet
With a swag as he makes out back ;
For battling on foot through the dust and heat
It was he who blazed the track.

“Austral Yank” : I know that cow cockies
are generally a careful lot, but 1 think I struck the
limit the other evening. I was talking to one of
the breed while he was separating - . The flies were
very bad, and when one got in the cream, he
removed it with thumb and forefinger—-but he
dipped the insect in the milk vat and washed the
cream off it before destroying it.
“Watty”; "Bad Australian” is wrong (B.
13/12/’23) in saying that wombats do not live in
logs. In the Gippsland hill country (Vic.) they
seldom dig a burrow. I have chopped them out
of logs many times. (Incidentally, the last one I
got out of a log was coal black.) A fully-grown
‘bat is as strong as a boar. I know, because one
dark night I was coming home through the bush
when the dogs found a wombat, in a log as usual.
Having a bull’s-eye lantern, I could see the wombat
about 20ft. down the big hollow. Then 1 did a fool

thing—l crawled into the log with the lantern in
one hand and a muzzle-loading’ shotgun in the
other. When I got close to the ’bat I found that
he had his rump towards me, so, wishing to shoot
him in the head, I focussed the light upon him,
and then prodded him with the gun. He turned
round and faced me. I pulled the triggers, one
after the other, but the gun missed fire. Alarmed
by the snapping of the caps, and the glare of the
light, the wombat charged for the open and getting
mixed up with my legs, carried me out of that
log in double-quick time. Two strong dogs set on
to him, but failed to hold him, and he went about
50yds. further into the scrub —probably into another
log. I could hear the dogs barking, but I had
had enough ’bat hunting for one night, and went
home. Yes, wombats live in logs all right.
ANOTHER GREAT MYSTERY.
THE KID: “What are ancestors, dad?”
DAD: “I am one of yours, my boy, and grandfather is another.”
THE KID ( staring hard at father) : “But I say, dad. why do people boast about them?”
“J. 11.5.”: Re “Wingella’s” mango-trees
in the N.T. which fruited twice in the one season
(B. (i/12/’23). It is nothing very extraordinary for
such trees to do this on the Central Queensland
coast, nor is it unusual for them when of the same
size and age to flower at different periods. At my
home there are nine mango-trees of various sizes and
ages, eight of which are seedlings from one or other
of the older trees. Not only do these trees flower
irregularly and often twice in the season, but no
two trees bear fruit exactly alike as regards quality
and color of flesh, which varies from a pale, greenish-
yellow to a deep, rich, almost reddish yellow. The
skin also varies in thickness as well as in color.
Mango-trees frequently fail to set a crop two or
three years in succession, although they may flower
heavily each season. All my trees are now bearing
heavily, except one which didn’t produce even a
solitary bloom.

“Hayband”: A Forbes (N.S.W.) man re-
cently took seven ounces of clover and trefoil seed
from in and about one ants’ nest. There were scores
of nests on every acre thereabouts, and in conse-
quence big patches were practically grassless. Same
is true all over Australia, and the accumulated damage
must be enormous. Do ants do any useful thing
to balance this destruction?
* * * *
“Eldorado”: The liveliest and most gruel-
ling mill 1 have ever witnessed between any two
featherweights I saw in
the vicinity of the Dar-
ling River (N.S.W.) the
other day. The con-
testants were a pair of
peewits. Trespassing was
evidently the origin of
the brawl, for I observed
a nest close handy.
Rounds one, two and
three were fought on the
bank of the river; then
they got into clinches
and rolled down 30ft. to
the stream below. I ex-
pected the immersion
would have damped their
ardor in a truly literal
sense, but this was not
the case—the bout con-
tinued as merrily as ever.
Getting interested in
the affair, I pulled my
boat over for a closer
view, and when I got
there I found that the
top-dog peewit had re-
sorted to foul play. He
was standing on his op-
ponent’s chest, and each
time the under-dog cried
for mercy the chap on
top would smother the
screams by thrusting the
head of his unfortunate adversary under water. In the
name of clean sport I decided to stop the bout.
I was too late, however. The conqueror shot off
skywards, leaving his opponent as dead as Tut.’s
mummy. At the post-mortem expert evidence —•
me being the expert—went to show that death had
resulted from asphyxia by drowning, vyith shock
and assault and battery as contributing causes.
* * * #
“Mouldy Ribs”: I called in at a cocky’s
home the other day, and while he and I were
talking business Mrs. Cocky came in carrying an
infant about a month old. I offered my congratula-
tions. “Oh, it’s’ not ours,” exclaimed Cocky; “it
belongs to the missus’s sister. But she’s too crook
to rear it, so the missus is poddying it for her.”
“C.C.”: Fifteen years ago a large shade
tree in Margaret-street, Toowoomba (Q.), was struck
by lightning, and so badly mutilated that it had
to be rooted out. A new tree was planted in its
stead, and, seven years later, met with a similar
fate —only on this occasion not even the stump
was left standing to be removed. The city council
then had a small oak planted in the unlucky spot,
and this tree was cleft completely in two during a
terrific hailstorm which passed over the city a month
or so ago. A young willow-tree now, adorns the
site, and the townsfolk are making bets as to how
long it will last. Who was the fool proverb-maker
who said something about lightning never striking
twice in the same place?
* * • *
“Bouragi”: Re “Parama’s” description of
“gumada” (B. 20/12/’23). The drink, which is
nothing more or less than the famous kava, is
favored by only a small section of the Papuans—
those of the Fly River delta. It is made, not from
a nettle-like plant, but from the roots and stalks of
Piper methysticum, a climbing vine. The roots
were chewed up by specially selected young women,
chosen for their fine teeth. Nowadays, even in Fiji,
where the kava making is still an elaborate cere-
monial, the root and stem are macerated by other
means than chewing. Kara is drunk, too, as soon
as it is made, and not left, as “Panama” says, for
48 hours. Except that the flavor resembles that of
warm soapsuds, there’s nothing objectionable about
the drink, though addiction to it brings about a
curious scurfy condition of the skin. The kava
plant grows thickly all over Papua, but, save for
those in the locality mentioned, the natives make
no attempt to turn it into a drink. It is quite
harmless and its only effect seems to be a con-
fusion of the legs, while the head remains clear.
I have a theory that kava making and drinking was
introduced to the Papuan Gulf quite recently, prob-
ably by the Fijian and Samoan seamen, who were
thick in the Thursday Island pearling and bfiche-de-
mer fleets years ago. Many Gulf Papuans also
worked on these boats, and could easily have picked
up the taste for kava. In the same way, and for the
same reason, they are about the only Papuan
people who have developed a taste for the white
man’s firewater.
* * * *
“Black Boy”: All those who wrote pars
about champion horsemen a while back seem to have
lost sight of the once-famous Harry Faber, now a
master-drover from Meekatharra northwards, in W.A.
He always has some champion nags with him and
at odd times takes on.a breaking-in contract. Yearly
Fiber’s buckjumping show is held at Meekatharra
in aid of the local hospital, and champion horsemen from
all quarters come to ride. The last event, on Dec.
4, brought no less than 45 horses, and among them
an outlaw from Mt. James which no man had ever
been able to conquer. Faber wagered a large amount
that he would ride this horse bareback, without
bridle; and, although the animal had been in a
{food paddock for 18 months and was as fit as a
fiddle, he was ridden to a standstill. The exhibi-
tion was an eye-opener.
* * * *
“Zanthus” : There is a curious link between
Australia and South America in the widespread use
by the aborigines of both continents of the woomera
or spear-thrower. . Joyce states in his “South
American Archaeology” that spear-throwers were
widely distributed throughout America. He describes
the types used in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru - ,
and gives a representation of an ancient hunter
using one —the picture is from a vase found on the
coast of Peru. Along the Andes the spear-thrower
consisted of a rod with a hook at the end which
fitted into a socket in the butt of the javelin.
In other parts of America the end of the spear-
thrower was sometimes fitted with a socket in
which the spear-butt rested. If, as has been alleged,
some of the Australian abos. used a form of the
bolas of the South American Indians, these simi-
larities in human culture are as remarkable as the
curious relationships between some Australian plants
and animals and others in South America. Bus
here’s a queer anomaly: while Tasmania’s fauna and
flora are more closely related to the fauna and flora
of the southern end of South America than are those
of the Australian mainland, the Tasmanian abos.
apparently never used the spear-thrower.
“Pantagru^l”: About 30 years ago there
lived at Rockhampton (C.Q.) an indescribably
unkempt individual who earned a precarious living
by opening and shutting a certain gate for travellers
passing through. There was reason to suppose that
this, eccentric never washed his face or removed iiis
hat; at all events, his hair had grown completely
through the hat, until the latter had become part of
his head. A murder under extremely revolting cir-
cumstances was committed near the gate, and the
gatekeeper was required as a witness. When he
was brought to the court a policeman attempted
to take oft' his hat, but couldn’t shift it an inch.
The difficulty was only removed when a sheep-shearer
was commissioned to operate. He clipped it and
the hair off in one mass.

“Gnarck”: Let me enter Joe Sears, of
Normanville, Kerang (Vic.), for the bag-'aewing cham-
pionship for this season. IT is best to date is 75
bags an hour for a four hours’ stretch. Two years
ago Joseph was a railway porter; but evidently the
lad didn’t lose all his hustle at that job.
"To W.” : 1 have found the black snake
aloft at an altitude of about 15ft. ; but just re-
cently a friend living in country where the black
devils wax corpulent and lengthy and are appallingly
common, saw one thrust his head out of a crack in
a fairly straight dead tree fully 30ft. above the
ground. There was a bees' nest in the crack a
little higher up. In most cases, however, the
climbing' serpents’ quest is birds’ eggs or nestlings.
I don’t think their menu includes bees or honey.
Another big black snake in the same locality man-
aged to squirm through fairly small-meshed wire-
netting. When once the wriggler starts on a trick
of that sort, if the mesh fits tightly, he has to
go right through with it, as he has no hope of
back-pedalling, because his body-plates (“scales”)
rough up and catch in the wire.
“Howitzer” : A pair of swallows nested
over our front door last year and brought a brood ot
four along safely. This year they varied the per-
formance (>y hatching two broods of four, with an
interval of two months between. In the last batch a
voracious stranger appeared and keeps the devoted

parents working overtime to supply tucker. To all
appearances the interloping fledgling is a starling.
Can any Abo. say whether it is usual for a swallow
to sit twice in three months; and does the starling
have the cuckoo habit?
“Raby” : About three months ago a fox-
tender of mine had a family of five pups, and the
arrival of the youngsters was a matter of great
excitement to a lady greyhound who shared the
same loose-box with the foxy. Two days later I
visited them, and was surprised to see signs of a
struggle, the two dogs being bitten and cut about
the head and ears. But whatever scrapping there
had been was now all over and peace reigned again.
The two ladies had evidently come to some
arrangement, as the greyhound was successfully
suckling three of the litter and the rightful mother
was looking after the other two. At first I thought
the greyhound was merely supplying her quota of the
pups with warmth, but investigation proved that
she was fulfilling the maternal role to the last
gratifying detail from the youngsters’ point of view.
At time of writing, the whole dislocated family ? s
doing fine.

“Blue Bar”: Record shots? Bob Old-
field, of Cudgegong, near Mudgee (N.S.W.), was
a while back informed by a small boy that a snake
had run into a hole under the house. Bob grabbed
a shotgun and fired it point-blank into the hole.
Then he dug the burrow out and discovered one black
snake, dead ; one brown snake, also dead ; two small
mice, very dead. All were riddled with shot from the
cartridge. They’re still talking about that shot up
at Cudgegong.

If you go down that valley,
Along its road, wheelworn,
When velvet winds are rustling
The brown sheaves of the corn,
You’ll see a river stretching
Its curved and silver arm
About the fertile acres
Of Connor's valley-farm.
Strong still and hale is Connor,
Though toil and care are his,
And if you chance upon him
And ask him how he i>,
“All's well, all's well,” -he'll answer,
For fine it is to tell,
Through flood and drought and failure,
ITis watchword is “All's well.”
Aged eighty, toilworn, time-worn,
He still will seem to you
Like some gnarled tree that brightens
With morning-shine and dew.
His heart still beats courageous
As when life’s work began,
For though years grey and bow him,
Ho still strides on —a man!
He still hopes on, hopes ever,
As lie has hoped for long,
And faces fate unflinching
And fights it with a song.
Above, beyond him looking
(He standing grey and bowed),
You’ll see the far-spread acres
That, fie has ploughed and ploughed—
Ploughed, ploughed, through many seasons,
Cleared, cleansed of root and weed,
And as you watch, you’ll murmur,
“Here stands a man indeed!”

Isko is the most wonderful machine ever designed—only two moving
parts, and these work in oil—no valves, no pistons or rings, no
condenser tower. Isko machines are practically silent.

Hear Sir, —
It will lie of interest to you to know that the Model
200 One-Ton Isko Refrigerating: Machine which you
supplied to this Hotel in January last is proving an
unqualified success.
It lias been in operation now for the past twelve
months, and the Thermostatic control is functioning
perfectly, stopping the machine when the desired
temperature is reached, and re-starting it when the
temperature again rises. The machine carries on
quite automatically, and we have not found it neces-
sary to go near it.
My Chef tells me that he is more than pleased with
the condition of the perishable foodstuffs which the
“ISKO” takes care of, which I attribute to the dry
refrigeration of the “ISKO” as opposed to the cold,
moist air of the old-fashioned ICE Chamber.
Although, as you know, the machine is only about
22 feet from my office, I sometimes do not hear it
running, as it is very silent in operation. To my
mind, this is a most important feature in my busi-
ness.
Believe me,
Yours faithfully,

Hear Sir, —
In response to your inquiry, I will state that we
purchased our small Isko Refrigerating Machine some
four to five years ago, and it has been working, when
the weather has been at all warm, ever since. As you
know, we use this machine for cooling chocolates, and,
as you may also know, we have at all times over-
loaded our Isko: in fact, our work really calls for a
refrigerator of at least one-half-ton capacity. How-
ever, the Isko has served us up to date.
We consider our Isko a wonderful little machine
and would not consider parting with it. except it
be replaced by a much larger capacity machine. We
have never had any trouble whatever with our Isko.
At a later date we hope to make some improvements
in our Chocolate factory, and hope to find use for
your larger model Isko.
Yours truly,
McKimmin’s Golden Gate Sundae Shops, I,td.

Dear Sir.—
I have much pleasure in stating; that the “ISKO”
Refrigerating Plant you installed /or us wine months
ago has been working to our uniform and entire satis-
faction.
The machine is clean, noiseless, and so far has
proved 100% efficient, and, moreover, has called for
the minimum of attention on the part of otir staff - .
We consider it an ideal installation for our busi-
ness, and are highly pleased with our choice of
machine.
Yours faithfully.

Admiral de Chair is bringing liis own
naval staff with him, thus following uncle’s
example. The old Viking’s one-time gent.-
helps have got on in the world since they
left Sydney. Leslie Wilson is the new Gov-
ernor of Bombay and an Excellency himself.
Hamnet Share rose to be Paymaster Rear-
Admiral. and has been given some sort of
job at the Empire Exhibition, where a good
many of those who knew him in the old days
will find him this year.
One irreverent person lias christened the
Archibald Prize the Mclnnes Endowment.
For the third year the Trustees have drawn
the cheque in favor of the Victorian, just as
another small group would no doubt give
Meldrum the prize 10 years running if it.
were the selector. Norman Carter's por-
trait of Leon Gellert is a more vivid and
interesting piece of work. The sensitive face
is beautifully reproduced—and in this canvas
the hands pass muster. Daryl Lindsay, in
a canary waistcoat and a blue tie, will be an
aged man before he lives down the sartorial
splendor in which he had Ms picture taken.
Muir Auld takes many an eye with his self
portrait; one of pianist Frank Hutchens is
not so good. Poetess Dora Wilcox is in the
gallery, her shoulders draped in a satisfying
red shawl. There are lots more entries,
and already the Sydney public is dipping
down to the basement of the Gallery to sec
what it thinks of the bunch.
Paris designers can say what they like
about ankles not being worn, but some gor-
geous autumn frocking that was unwrapped
at Sydney on the hottest day of last week
ended above what is many a Sydney woman’s
greatest charm (and what a goose she’d be
to hide it because the Cold Country woman
chooses a style to cover the ungraceful line
of her own extremities!). Rich and gor-
geous you must be next winter if you intend
to be in the picture. Velvets, so silken and
fine that they almost purr; embroideries
everywhere; fur collars, cuffs and hems to
your coats —and every dress has a coat. The
day-by-day costume is a three-piece, the coats
showing a decided Russian influence —long-
cut, knee-length at least. The top of the
dress is built of the glittering lame, which is
a sort of tissue embroidered in tinsel, Orien-
tal or Russian in effect—to whichever part
of the compass the wearer’s inclination
points. This top-piece is long-waisted and
finished off around the hips with a swathe
of itself, in many cases crescendoing, centre-
front, in a jewelled clasp. Green, a shade
lighter than that attributed to Robin Hood,
is to be the rage. One luscious three-piece
in this tone was made of velvet with a lame
top to the frock, in which silver, mauve and
greens were cunningly interwoven, the long
straight coat finished off with cuffs, collar
and hem of soft fur —stone marten, perhaps.
One would think the day frocks and topcoats
had been built in Petrograd rather than in
Paris. There was a topcoat that was a
splendid thing of good old-fashioned black
broadcloth, worth in the Russian rouble a
king’s ransom. From hem to ear-high collar
it was stiff w T itli fine white embroideries.
Then there was a coat of black matalasse,
which ran to the glory of silky Russian hare
(probably Australian bunny under another
name) for its extremities. One black velvet
three-piece had its coat so thickly sown with
nail-heads and steel beads that its wearer
might be thought to be in the disarmament
business and using up the loose end of the
battle-cruisers. The linings are as gorgeous
and luxurious as the outsides, and are of
anything from magnificent printed marocains
to satins that vary from lager to a rich
garnet tone.
Lord Jersey, who has just died, was a
boy at Eton when his father arrived in
N. S. Wales as Governor. His interests
were chiefly sporting, and he was a leading
member of the Turf Club. Perhaps his most
notable feat was to win over £20,000 on a
system at roulette. He succeeded to the
title during the war, and Osterley, which had
been a sort of home from home for promi-
nent Australians under the regime of his
intensely well-meaning, religious and im-
perialistic mother, knew them no more.
The only social difference between post-war
Tirranna and a Spring meeting at Randwick
is that, while all the young things go to both,
some of the matrons dodge the strenuous
Goulburn fixture. The drive to the course
is longer and dustier than the one through
pleasant Moore Park, and the facilities for
nose-powdering, cooling-down and recuper-
ating generally are not on a metropolitan
scale. Nevertheless Wally Gunn, who, as
secretary, has controlled the destinies of the
meeting for 30 years now, has done wonders,
and in the opinion of most people Tirranna is
as far ahead of any other picnic club —not even
excepting Bong Bong—as the Goulburn Club
is ahead of the other country clubs in N. S.
Wales. The most noticeable girls were
Clarice Anderson, part-owner of the winner
of the Wynella Stakes; Mrs. Sydney Jamie-
son’s exquisite little daughter Anne; Mar-
garet Allen, whose brother and brother-in-
law Ken Austin were riding, and who rides
nearly as well as they do; Moira
Brady, looking more like a picture-film
beauty than ever in those rustic sur-
roundings ; and some pretty Osborne, Hor-
dern and Bowker girls.
Queensland’s impressive Premier Theo-
dore. who declined to do any talking for the
public ear in Sydney, was the star guest
at an Ambassadors dinner given by mining-
man W. H. Corbould. Presumably this
mean's that Theodore goes off on his money-
hunting mission with the blessing of his
host, who, as the chief potentate of Clou-
curry, has a strong pull in those quarters in
London which think they are “developing the
Empire’’ when they have a flutter in one
of its share gambles.
Tien Hogue, now Mrs. Wyatt, came back
to Sydney a few weeks ago to be in time for
pretty little sister Jean’s marriage to-day
(Thursday). The bridal finery includes cob-
webby masses of lace, brought by Tien to
act as train and veil for the occasion. The
Mosman Presbyterian Church stages the pro-
logue to domesticity, and the girl-friends of
the bride are busy on the flowering glories
that will mitigate the severity of the John
Knox interior.
A Waverley wedding has had a feature
which ought to be unique in its way. The
bride had three generations of ancestors to
smile upon her nuptials. Her great-grand-
father was a hale veteran in the early eighties
who had married at 20. His eldest daughter
and her daughter had both married at 20 ;
and the bride was repeating a habit in the
fourth generation.
A Wellington wind is no more Maoriland-
ish than one of the weddings at St. Chad’s
Church. Cremorne, last week. The bride,
Una Miro Aotea, w T as a daughter of Pierce
Freetli, one time of the Wellington Times;
the bridegroom was Leslie Moss, of Welling-
ton ; the bridesmaid Eunice Kirby, daughter
of well-known Sydney and Wellington jour-
nalist Fred Kirby; the guests almost exclu-
sively from the Dominion that rocks like a
floating pontoon.
This attractive-looking girl is Wanda Rad-
ford, of Sydney for the past eight months,
but originally
from Adelaide.
Wanda, who
has spent most
of her life in
London an <1
Paris, started
on her travels
with the in-
tention of con-
quering the
stage, and now
finds herself
a commercial
artist of origi-
nal i t y and
force. She has
had no lessons
in drawing,
but a natural
gift was fos-
tered by asso-
ciation with
such masters
of their craft
as Brian, Soulie and Arthur Rackham. At
present the clever girl spreads diamond neck-
laces on her bread and butter by designing
catalogues and posters and things for David
Jones.
An over-the-Harbor bride-to-be evolved
something different in the way of a trous-
seau-tea the other afternoon. As the guests
arrived they were handed a programme of the
events, and on casting an eye on the card
they found the trousseau display was to take
the form of a parade, with the bridesmaids
acting as mannequins. So the georgette
cami-knickers, the wispy sleeping-suits, the
ribbon garters and the latest thing in from-
the-waist-down corsets had their first airing.
The shy and blushing bride is as dead as
the starched petticoat.
The latest engagement in tennis circles is
that of Lorna Bull, who carried off the
schoolgirls’ championship a year or two ago.
and Dr. Leslie Utz, of Macquarie-street. He’s
one of the fennis-playing family, and is on
speaking terms with all the microbes known
in the best circles.
Country tennis-players, in town for their
annual week at the Sydney nets, can’t com
plain of any lack of interest in their, doings.
The stands at the Wliite City courts were
packed even on the hottest days last week.
One afternoon the kiosk took £4O for cool
drinks alone; and what the chemist took
from the girl-player from Inverell, the back
of whose neck was one big blister by the
end of the second day, has probably bought
him a Rolls-Royce.
Queerly enough the hard courts top-dressed
in green have never become popular at the
White City. As long as there was a grass
court to play on nobody would look at the
emerald sand siftings; so these courts are
going to be turfed over, with the exception
of three; and even from these the Irish Free
State’s blush is to go.
Duncan Macdougall, whose picture goes to
you with this, is chief spirit in the Playbox
Society, which aims at giving Sydney plays
of to-day,
about pro-
b 1 e m s and
along thought-
avenues of to-
day. He and
his company
started out by
giving Sydney
a chance to
judge Eugene
O’Neil’s
“Hairy Ape,”
in which the
author (in
company with
S h akspeare)
has realised
that drama is
the t hin g
yo u thi n k
rather tli a n
the tiling you
do. Mr. Mac-
dougall, wh o
was convincing as Yank, the principal char-
acter in Mr. O’Neil's play, comes with a
great reputation from the Barn Theatre,
New York.
A line from Dora Wilcox
Australia seems just now a sort of playground lor
the British aristocracy. •"'But most of them have
earned the right to relax a little. How magnificent
many of their women were in the war-time!
Lady Ripon, Lady Maude Wilbruham, Lady Harrowby
and her daughters just about to visit Sydney—these
names come to one’s mind at once, and their
devotion, their kindness and their simplicity will
not soon be forgotten by those who came in contact
with them. Lady Cassillis . too, just arrived with
her husband at Fremantle by the Osterley, led a
strenuous life. I have a vivid recollection of seeing
her in a horribly overcrowded ’bus —those who know
London in recent years will also know what that
means! —strap-hanging- like any daughter of the-
proletariat.- With this difference only—that the
Countess (her husband is heir to the Marquisate of
Ailsa) was more cheerful than any other passenger.
Lord Cassillis’s brother, Lord Angus Kennedy, has
gone in for motor mechanics since the war, and at
the time of his marriage, a year or two back, the
London papers reported that most of his courting
had been done in the Zoo during his time off work.
Mrs. Maclurcan has ordained that not only
the children of Elizabeth Bay and Darling
Point shall possess the Wentworth ; so she lias
hit upon a new way of giving the pinched kid-
dies of Sydney a treat. On the afternoon of the
24th a tea-party of gigantic proportions will
be spread in the ballroom and palm court,
and any poor child is welcome provided a
clergyman or school teacher, will hand on its
name. The party will be known as the
Clancy Kids’ afternoon, and the hostess is
offering five, prizes of five guineas for the
five best Clancys. It’s going- to be some-
thing like a party, with everything thrown in
—even tram tickets, if necessary.
A line from an old acquaintance:—
Rev. Alan Whitehorn, who has received a call
from Sydney to one of the most fashionable of New
York Episcopal churches, used to be a school-teacher
in Westralia. He doesn’t lack ability, but his
great asset is his manner. I can remember being
impressed 23 years ago (he was only a monitor then)
by his soft, insinuating voice and his faculty of
seeming enormously interested in persons for whoifi
he couldn’t have cared tuppence. Travel (lie has
been a great globetrotter) has cultivated these gifts
to a point at which old ladies find them irresistible
(the kids, who are shrewd judges of character, have
been Alan’s friends all along). Your successful
parson need not be a profound theologian or even an
apt pulpit orator, but he must have a manner.
S.P.C.A. enthusiasts will be interested in
hearing of the gift of a block of land at
Lcura to their beloved society. The land,
which has been given by Airs. Linda Prince,
of Woollahra, an R.S.P.C.A. councillor, is
close to the golf links, is Torrens title, and
the society will accept for it a price 20 per
cent, below the shire assessment. Now,
what offers?
Penwoman Daphne Deane arranged a tea-
drinking in the Jacobean room of the Ren-
dezvous early in the week in honor of song-
bird Winifred .Tenner and her co-worker and
accompanist, Miss Loveday. While the billy
boiled waves of music brought mental cool-
ness to an otherwise torrid atmosphere, and
melting woman forgot even to fan herself
as the liquid voice and the rippling accom-
paniment flowed through the panelled room.
The grand-opera chorus trained by Mowle
gave the public a chance to hear what it
could do in the way of musical climax at
the Empire Fair in the Town Ilall, and list-
eners who have heard opera in Paris, Milan
and London declare that the Australian sing-
ers are as good in their chorus work as their
Italian brethren, and in quality of voice
better.
Maud MaeCarthy, daughter of Sydney’s
well-remembered doctor, who added model-
ling, painting and composing to his other
accomplishments, is shining with reflected
glory .just now. Her composer husband, .John
Foulds, presented his latest work, “World
Requiem,” at the vast Albert Hall on Armis-
tice Day, and it was “monumental and im-
pressive.” Maud, a brilliant violinist, con-
ducted the orchestra.
The new president of the Dental Associa-
tion, Dr. Norman Taylor, is quite a young-
ster: he was born as recently as 1893. He
served with the A.I.F. Dental Corps abroad
—was one of its first members—and, return-
ing, became attached to Prince of Wales
Hospital (Randwick). The toothsmiths of
the State are not, however, a solid body.
There are, in particular, the “ethical” and
the—well, the others, the others being those
who advertise. But as the advertising men
make most money, as a rule, they put up
with it.
At the end of February the Rev. M. Ein-
feld, one of the ministers of Sydney’s Great
Synagogue, is to go to Europe on a six-
months’ holiday, after 15 years’ service. Ib-
is a “red .Tew” —a type common enough
amongst the ancient Hebrews. The possessor
of a very fine voice, he is “cantor” at the
Synagogue—the minister who leads the
chants and recites the ritual.
Two pretty girls who have been adding a
lustre to Sydney’s dinner-dances for the past
weeks are Claire and Marjory Cummings,
of Queensland. Mother, who is still remem-
bered in Brisbane as the beautiful Miss
Flynn, is with them, and the family group's
headquarters during the summer months will
be Justice Isaacs’s flat at Hampton Court.
A I’.S. from Brisbane:—
Lady Jellicoe and daughter Lucy arrived by the
Tango Maru from China. H.M.S. Petei'field took
them from Hong Kong to Manila, and they explored
the principal parts of the land of chop suey
during their trip. Michael Rogers met them here
on behalf of Sir Matthew, and whirled them out r.o
afternoon tea and to dine with his Ex. In the
evening they got aboard again to go on to Sydney.
The city branch of the Queensland Country
Women’s Association is persuading the local papers
to open a subscription list to fetch backbloek
kiddies down to the sea in the summer months.
Five hundred town children are to be asked to
hand out a shilling- a head to help their bush
brothers and sisters to taste the sea breezes in
March and April.
Laura Smith, the charming secretary of the
Diggers’ C. E. Help Society, has been hard hit by
the death, on the eve of her wedding', of the man
to whom she was. engaged, Captain George Murray
Mills. And it had been such a long engagement.
“Bertie” McConnell, of Marshlands, has promised
to love and honor, at some future date and onwards,
Major G. H. Bourne, a sub-inspector of the Bank
of N. S. Wales and son of J. S. P. Bourne of
Brisbane.
Sir Matthew had a men’s tennis party a few
days ago. Those who played were Norman Pixley,
the L’Estranges, A. Robinson and A. Devereux. Dr.
-Eneas McDonnell, of Toowoomba, is at present stay-
ing with Sir Matthew.
Cumming Ogg continues to bravely predict cool
changes, but so far they have been seen only with
the eye of faith ; and the thermometer sits steadily
at 99 deg. or thereabouts.
The social centre seems to have shifted to South-
port, where Mrs. ’Ladbury in a setting of roses
and fern gave a big tea at the Eastern tea-rooms.
A jazz band played, and the Cannan maiden carried
off a jewel-case in a guessing competition. Mrs.
Duckett White gave a supper party there; and Mrs.
J. T. Bell, Margot Bell, the Ross Munros, the Mac-
donalds and the Crombies were among the suppers.
Joyce Godsall and Cynthia Booth Clarkson also
gathered their friends together to sup in the same
spot. With tennis tournaments and visiting bowlers
from the Downs, Southport also makes merry.
That sensible sky pilot Fernharn Maynard has
decided that the open air’s the thing if you want
a congregation on these hot nights. He sits his on
the grassy lawn and preaches at them under the
stars. All Saints’ church, Wiekham-terrace —Douglas
Price’s old haunt —is his habitat.
Death quickly’ followed the 85th Christmas of Mrs.
Kate Bourke, and gathered in Innisfail’s earliest female
settler. Forty years ago her motherly kindness to
the sick and needy of the district earned her the title
of Queen of Geraldton.
And another from a Digger:—
Your Brisbane corespondent missed a rather inter-
esting point in connection with the Diggers Co.
entertainment at Rosemount Military Hospital on
Christmas Eve; it was that a Brisbane journalist,
Ruby D. Eve, paid for the party out of the cheque
she received for writing a couple of Digger sketches.
There are 95 boys still in the institution, and it
costs a tidy sum to pay for smokes, sweets and
cakes for the bunch. During the years she has

HARDY'S WTNES* OF


Permanent Hair Waving
Accentuates Attractiveness
The many advantages of softly waved hair are
too obvious to need much commendation. To
the smart woman, so important a part does it
play in her coiffure, that it has become quite a
fashionable craze. Farmer’s use a special, per-
manent hair waving process which produces
exquisite waves that remain the same even
after shampooing, and does not in any way
effect the growth, or destroy the natural sheen.
Appointments may be booked by personal
application in the Hairdressing Salon, Third
Floor, or by phoning, City, Eleven Thousand.

Phones[?] Cantrel 1532, 1533,
The Stradbrokes have no luck so far as
the weather is concerned, and Friday’s gar-
den reception to the Jap officers provided no
exception to the rule. But the cheerful pair
refuse to be downhearted over trifles, and
their optimism is infectious. Friday’s
crowd, having defied the tempestuous gales
with serviceable coverings, found the affair
quite jolly and interesting. Huge tea-tents
provided sanctuary from a heavy downpour,
which was followed by enough sunshine to
allow everyone to get home without un-
furling brollies. An earlier outburst of
wintry sunshine allowed the outdoor hand-
shaking interval to pass off without disaster.
Lady Stradbroke had covered her slimness
with brown cloth heavily hemmed with fur,
and wore a brown hat with an ostrich
feather on the back ledge. Lady Helena,
who is rapidly developing into a beauty,
warmed herself with a brocaded ficelle coatee,
over skirtings of the same shade, and had
thatched her head in a wide-brimmed brown
>*at The other girl was quite all right in
a black-fringed violet frock and inky hat.
Hester Pliillimore looked cosy in fawn. Fed-
eral vice-royalty was represented by Mrs.
I itt-Rivers and Lady Doris Blackwood, both
black-marocained, the former in a green hat.
State Premier Lawson convoyed his wife, who
topped pale-green draperies with a black hat.
Commodore Hyde brought his wife, in all
black; and Mrs. Bob Knox, with lacy hang-
ings blowing in the wind, also looked very
like a spilt bottle of ink. The George Lan-
dale matron, down from Macedon for the
event, sheltered lace hangings under a furred
cloak. On Sunday she and her husband were
to have a spread at Macedon for the Jap
Admiral and a bunch of his officers. The
visitors got acquainted very speedily with
our social lights, and very few were seen
wearing a lonely look. They appear to be
interested in everything and everyone, but
as few can speak English they have to ex-
press what they feel in smiles.
The James Barretts—he is the kingpin
of the Japanese League here —stood the
naval visitors a party at Palmyra. The
lady of the house received in black silk, top-
storeyed with floral patternings on a tangerine
ground, a little harmonising cape and a black
hat. The doctor, who is an A.M.C. colonel,
wore khaki. Half-way through the proceed-
ings, he was horrified to learn that a be-
lated char-a-banc load of middies were loiter
ing outside the garden gate, too shy to make
an unescorted entry. He made his apologies
in person. Cake and ices were spread in the
dining-room and old schoolroom in a flower
scheme of blue, while a stringed band pro-
vided music in the offing. Daughters Cara
(becomingly enfolded in dark-grounded floral
effects) and Bertha (dimpling attractively in
blue organdie) saw to it that no one went
lonely or unfed. The foreign guests divided
their brightest smiles between a conjurer
who dispensed black magic on the side ver-
andah and the friendly little wallabies and
other Aussie animals in the Barretts’ minia-
ture zoo. They have no native-bear, but the
blank was filled in by Mrs. Edwards’s Teddy,
who, with a red bow defiantly erect on his
furry neck, came in for wholesale commenda-
tion as he nibbled his leafy tea from his
owner’s arms. Generals Coxen and Sell-
heim and Col. Eric Harrison convoyed their
wives, Mrs. Harrison supporting ' a green
head-dress that was largely ostrich feathers.
The Stradbroke daughters struck a pleasing
note—Lady Charlotte in ficelle georgette
draperies with a rosy blush of tulle veiling
the whiteness of her neck under a brown hat-
brim ; her sister, in red and white silk shap-
ings, surmounted by a black hat.
Our Japanese visitors have weird ways—
from our standpoint. One bland young officer
asked to be allowed to snapshot the Parlia-
mentary portrait of Queen Victoria! It was
probably the first time the work had been
noticed for a generation. Another said lie
desired to get out into the country. “I wish
to see the Meadow,” he said. “The charac-
teristic of a people is to be found in the
Meadow. Your city is beautiful, but I shall
see the life as you are in the Meadow.” So
arrangements are being made to motor or
rail parties to our Meadow. This officer
invited some friends to visit his ship.
“Please.” he asked politely, “not to come be-
fore S o'clock in the morning”—showing that
he does not yet know Melbourne.
The Earl of Harrowby, his Countess and
their daughter are due here in mid-January.
Many Diggers will remember them with
gratitude. A mixed assemblage of Aussies,
Canadians, S’Africans, West Indians and
stray Yanks congregated every Sunday after-
noon in the rose-and-gold llarrowby recep-
tion-rooms in Grosvenor-place. They
glimpsed, many for the first time, frigid
marble staircases, an astounded butler,
damask-hung reception-rooms complete with
gilt furniture, crystal chandeliers, family
portraits and a general air of aristocratic
detachment from the common usages of draw-
ings-rooms, as one has it in the best musical
comedies. From the windows they might
overlook, if fortunate, the gambols of royalty
itself, for just opposite are the grounds of
Buckingham Palace. On week-days the
daughter of the house, Bady Frances Ryder,
toiled with card system, typewriter and a
band of titled helpers, despatching their pro-
teges all over England, Scotland and as much
of Ireland as was possible. Lord llarrow-
by, a large, impressive man. who looks as
if he were created expressly for the part of
the Admirable Crichton, has been in Aus-
tralia before. Lady llarrowby is a daughter
of that W. H. Smith whose business as book-
and newspaper-agent is the 7uost colossal
of its kind in the United Kingdom. She has
good looks arid a charming grand-dame
manner.
The homecoming of Theodore Fink was
saddened by the death at sea of Mrs. Fink,
who had been with him .on a 10-months’trip
to the Cold Land. The family must have
had a premonition, as two of them, a daugh-
ter (Mrs. li. £>. Elliott) and a son
(Tliorold), met the old folks at Colombo. A
day out from Fremantle Mrs. Fink was given
an ocean burial. It was news to many
people to learn that she was one of the
founders of the Christian Science Church in
Melbourne, and had contributed largely to-
wards the erection of the temple in St. Kilda-
road. She was a daughter of George Isaacs,
of Castlemaine.
The William Mcßeaths are off on the
Narkunda to spend a few months in Eng-
land. The younger Mcßeath daughter,
Annie, has reinforced her travelling kit with
a half-hoop of prospective matrimony, which
was placed on her third left linger by John
Williams, the elder son of the -John Williams
widow, whose Toorak homestead is in Clen-
don-road.
The W. Crawfords, of Toorak, have been
murmuring “Bless you, my children,” to their
pretty little 20-year-old daughter, Margaret,
and lan Serjeant, younger son of the P. P.
Serjeants, of Malvern and Traralgon (Gipps-
land), who have agreed to make a matri-
monial date. The bridegroom-elect, who only
lately passed his 22nd milestone, is sprinting
along the road to a legal career, and at the
last ’Varsity 'Comment, was handed his
LL.B. degree.
Mrs. Gwen Serjeant White, snapped for
this Letter by Rembrandt, is a leading Mel-
bourne penwoman and the women’s repre-
sentative on the Vic. Council of the Journal-
ists’ Association : the popular matron was put
there last year by the united voice of her
sister ink-splashers. The Victorian is the
only State Council on which a member of
the sex is to be found. The lady, who is a
daughter of a
fam o u s
scholar. the
late Canon
Serjeant, o f
B e e c h worth
and Williams-
town, uses her
very facile pen
on behalf of
the inter-State
Press. She
does also some
short - story
writing, and
spins humor-
ous yarns—
which is sel-
dom the way
of the more
emotional sex.
Her scribbling
habit was in-
herited from a
, , . ~ father. who
had it even m lus college days at Oxford. As
his mother was similarly inclined, small won-
der that his daughters should have dropped
into print. Two married Serjeant girls, one
m England and one in the West, do some
writing, and an unmarried sister is on the
Weekly Times. The A.J.A.’s lady council-
lor is the widow of a well-known Gippsland
grazier, J. B. White, of Yelore. A school-
gii 1 daughter already threatens to outrival
mother and aunts as a story-writer.
Another engagement is that of ex-Senator
Chataways only daughter, Grace, and her
cousin, Sidney Carver, who grazes his sheep
at lenda. His father, Walter Carver, crossed
from England shortly before the Big Trouble
to plant himself and his familv on the land •
but had hardly settled at Leeton when young
Sidney went off with the Anzacs, and did
not return till after the Armistice. His
elder brother, who was attached to a Carver
uncle’s big business activities in Egypt, fell
in action early in the war.
State politicians were interested on Tues-
day in the marriage of Muriel Carter to
young Clement Bassetf-Smith, a prosperous
young farmer who is stirring up the earth
iu the neighborhood of Kyabram. Muriel is
the only daughter of Gordon Carter, a Par-
liamentary Boswell who occupies a unique
place in the affections of all sides of the
State Assembly. If the bride has any of her
dad’s gift for popularity, Kyabram will be
meeting her with a brass band and a red
carpet.
All avaftafe-lo officials lined up at Federal
Parliament House the other day to wish
bon voyage to Sergcant-at-Arras McGregor,
who has since embarked on the seas of matri-
mony with Willie Watt’s former sec., Madge
Lawrence. A case of expensive cutlery was
put in the hands of the nervous 'groom,
whose natural pinkness warmed to a ripe
tomato as one of his colleagues totted up the
manifold excellences of his bride and breath-
lessly poured superlatives on himself.
If many citizens were as musically intelli-
gent as Mrs. Albert Miller, here pictured,
concert and operatic performances would
never suffer from poor houses, her name being
rarely amongst the missing from any worth-
while musical
even t. The
matron might
ha v c earned
fame as a
pianiste had
she been less
favorably
situated: at
the completion
of her schol-
astic career in
England her
music instruc-
to r s wanted
the Australian
girl to qualify
for the con-
cert platform.
The versatile
matron docs
not centre her
whole atten-
tion on music,
however, but
is keen on such uuugs as antique rnmiuire,
of which she shelters a priceless collection
(mostly family possessions) in her Toorak
home, Moonga. One room is equipped with
the early-Victorian furnishings which glad-
dened her reception-parlor as a bride. Like
her late husband, she has always been
actively concerned in charitable and philan-
thropic endeavors, and, incidentally, is one
of the best-liked women in Toorak’s social
swim. One son, medical-major Guy Miller,
who fell in action in France after securing
a Military Cross, inherited his mother's
musical talent, which, in his case, found
its expression on the violin.
Mrs. E. Currie gladdened the Western Dis-
trict the other night with a farewell jazz for
Madge and JN’ora Currie, who are tripping to
England under the maternal wing, and AJine
Dowling, who is going with them. Madge’s
Saratogas are loaded with wedding gifts,
which will be unpacked soon after the travel-
lers arrive in the Fog, where the good-look-
young woman is to be handed over to her
naval fiance, Lieut. Harry Denham.
Ina Pigdon and James Williams swore to
love and honor each other at Camberwell St.
Mark’s—and elsewhere. The bride, who was
handed over by Alec McCracken, gave orange
blossoms a miss, and wore cinnamon geor-
gette hedged in each side with tiny frills.
Tawny roses blossomed on the upper edge of
one set of frillings, and climbed over her
black headgear, and there was a mid-Vic-
torian posy of blue blossoms. A sister
’maided in a champagne frock under a black
hat, and carried pink roses. John Morri-
son carried the bridegroom’s smelling-salts.
Mrs. R. McAllister entertained afterwards
at her Camberwell home, in brown with
Paisley dressings. Her brown hat was
wreathed with green and gold-shot silk.
Mrs. Pigdon stood by her hostess-daughter
m fuchsia silk hangings, a black hat and
a fuchsia-tinted posy.
The Gentlewoman’s Aid Society and other
philanthropic endeavors will be the poorer by
the passing of Amy Flower, youngest daugh-
ter of the late Horace Flower, of Port Fairy
and Flowerdale, Toorak. She was bitten by
a snake during a solitary walk in the Heales-
ville bush. Having fainted on sighting the
reptile, she did not realise that it had
attacked her until some time later, when
remedies were of no avail.
Mrs. Fred Bird is home again, but the
medico will not be here for months to come.
He has been putting in some delightful weeks
with our old friend Victor Hood and the lat-
ter s brother Alexander in Sicily. Alexander
is Duke of Bronte and owner of the Gastello
di Mamace in the island with which the
family name is associated. Victor now spends
most of his days there. Mrs. Bird, who is very
keen on hand-weaving, and has turned out
yards of the finest woollen material since she
first learned to work the loom, will get a
warm welcome back from our local art and
craft workers. At one time she was one
of the most promising pupils at the Victorian
National Gallery.
Victoria League enthusiasts staged a
garden bazaar in flowery Dreamtliorpe on
Saturday, the idea being to found a scholar-
ship at the local State school. Macedon
seethed from dawn to daylight with vehicles
of every degree, from the haughty Rolls-
Royce to over-worked buggies, all either
going to or leaving Lavender Fayre, as the
show was called. Lavender scented the
breeze for miles around. A ton-load was
absorbed in decorations alone, while small
Greenaway maids cried “Sweet lavender!"
from little grey wheelbarrows. Two little
girls dressed as vegetable Johns with baskets
athwart their shoulders did a roaring trade
in cabbages and peas. Countess Stradbroke
unveiled the Fayre in fur-bordered fawn and
a big brown hat, enjoying the moral support
during the process of the Rous sons and
daughter Helena, xvho flew what looked like
a small-pox signal above fuji-silk stripings.
The George Landales’ eldest girl, Diana, left
her lavender-loaded wheelbarrow to present
a floral trophy. The Hodges lady, in laven-
der to tone with the surroundings, headed
the welcoming committee—Dreamtliorpe is
her home. With her were the hon. sec.,
Lillias Thompson, and the Grice dame,
whose golden-haired daughter, Hilda, ran
a handkerchief sale under a mammoth cre-
tonne umbrella. Two O’Loghlen sisters
helped. There was canoeing on the moun-
tain stream which meanders through the
garden, and pony-riding in a paddock on
steeds loaned by the Russell Clarke and
Hugh Bullivant kids. Sheila Shannon, in
pink-silk skirtings, attracted a full house in
the front ( parlor with a series of balloon
dances. The handsome wife of Justice Isaac?
came with her daughter, Mrs. David Cohen,
who had arrived lately from Sydney.
Maud Grantham wrote from London in
leggy November that she was about to mix
business with sight-seeing. On Saturday
before Christmas she was going to recite
Dickens’s “Carol” at the Central Hall, West-
minster, and this month she is to do “The
Cricket on the Hearth” for the Dickens Fel-
lowship. During the Fellowship’s 21 years
the “Cricket” has never been given in its
entirety, and Maud Grantham is the first
woman who. has regularly chirped any of it
on the platform. Much scurrying around
has somewhat diminished the buxom lady’s
figure, the bounteousness whereof had been
a worry to her ever since she first set Mar-
ley’s ghost walking.
Incidentally, the latest swank is not to
call your slice of someone else’s house a flat,
but a maisonette. Most of the old houses
on fashionable St. Kilda-road are now-
pieced out in sections or slices because of the
high rents, and the elite who sardine them-
selves into two or three rooms and a bath
in this admired quarter reckon they are abso-
lutely It when they chortle, “We have a
maisonette on St. Kilda-road, y’ know.”
Adelaide sends her week's story:—
tVere in the throes of a Boy Scouts’ Corroboree,
and streets are ablock with male infants in khaki
knickers, with a few of their elder’s and mentors
in the same guise by way of comic relief. Fifteen
hundred of them —Scouts, not mentors —have de-
scended upon us from other States and our own dis-
tricts, and are mostly camping' in the Jubilee Exhibi-
tion Grounds, where 600 of them feed at a sitting
in the northern annex. His Federal Ex. is coming
over for the show, our own Ex. has promised to be
at most of the engagements, and the programme in-
cludes everything from civic receptions and concerts
to parades at Government House and violent days of
corroboree and sports. Meanwhile, not to be out-
done, there’s a Girl Guides’ camp at Mt. Lofty, and
Lady Bridges ran up to have a look at it.
The end of the month will see one of the most
popular of the younger set waving farewells to this
village. She is Joan Whitby, and will be bound
Londonwards for her marriage to Flijht-Lieut. A. H.
Flower.
The news that Professor Horace Lamb has annexed
the Copley Medal, thereby adding- his name to a
list that includes Huxley, Charles Darwin and Lord
Kelvin, sends old stagers here turning back pages
to the late ’seventies and early ’eighties, when he
was Professor of Maths, at our own Uni.—a job
which he relinquished for a similar one at Manchester.
A cable brings word of the death of Mrs. Frederick
W right, daughter of the Major O’Halloran from
whom O’Hallorau Hill takes its name. Her chief
hobbies were the Children’s Hospital (which called
one of its wards after her) and the St. John Ambu-
lance, her work for the latter bringing her the decora-
tion of a Lady of Grace. Her eldest daughter is the
widow of H. P. Gill, founder of our School of
Design, and the reason of most of its success.
Victor Harbor is .about the only spot in this State
that shows any signs of life at the moment, and
there the younger and youngest sets are having it
all their own way.

Triple-Wear in its original form represented the makers’ successful endeavour to pro-
duce a Stronger Silken Stocking than had previously been considered possible—one
that would invariably &ive Satisfactory Wear under the most exacting conditions
and which, in doin& so, would cater specifically for the Silken Hosiery needs of the
Vigorous out-of-doors Australian Girl.
And well did Triple-Wear carry out its mission of SERVICE! Fully, did it justify
the claims signified by its title — Triple-Wear : “ the Hose that £ives 3 times the
Wear.”
But in producing a Silken Stocking distinguished by phenomenal Strength, minor
refinements had to be sacrificed. In the “ old ” Triple-Wear a certain coarseness of
Fibre, a slight of harshness to the touch could not be avoided.
In the “New” Triple-Wear these defects in detail have been entirely obviated, for
Triple-Wear is now knitted in Sylk-Arto Thread.
The Triple-Wear you buy to-day is still the Heaviest of all Silken Hosiery. Its
plated structure still represents the last word in Silken Hosiery Strength. It is still
the Ideal Silken Hose for the very-much-alive Australian out-of-doors Girl. It
is still the one Silken Hose for those who require “ out-size ” stockings or who are
naturally “Hard on Hosiery.”
But in addition the new Triple-Wear possesses all the advantages inherent in Pure
Silk Texture combined with that lovely Lustrous Finish which is the distinctive
characteristic of Sylk-Arto Thread.

Private Owners!
Read this splendid testimonial from an Essex owner
in the mountainous district of Lithgow, N.S.W.
Lithgow,
Messrs. DALGETY & CO., 17/12/’23.
Dear Sirs,—
I have frequently been amused by glowing testimonials written by owners of new
cars after driving them five hundred miles or so. The worst car on the market would
probably stand up for that distance. Now, after running my “ESSEX” for over seven
thousand miles in twelve months I feel that I can speak of its behaviour. As you know,
I live in the heart of one of the most mountainous districts of N.S.W., where straight
roads and level roads are unknown; an excellent testing-ground for any car. I rarelj'- go
out with less than six people and frequently drive over rough bush tracks, across creeks and
through deep sand, etc.
I am still on the original tyres, and the bodies are in such good condition that they
will all stand re-treading. I never get less than twenty-five miles to the gallon, and on
good roads have frequently got over thirty, and this without any special effort at economy.
Even on the worst of roads the “ESSEX” is the most comfortable car I have ever
driven, and in this hilly country 1 appreciate its wonderful hill-climbing powers. At six
thousand miles I had the cylinder head taken off to clean out the carbon, but there was so
little there that it was scarcely worth touching.
Oil consumption is so small that 1 cannot tell you what it is, as I am in the habit of
running out the old oil every two thousand miles and putting fresh in.
Another good point is the high average speed attainable without racing or taking
risks, and the ease of handling allows of long journeys without fatigue.
I have had four cars, including one high-class English production, but so far the
"ESSEX” is giving better service than any of the others.
You may use this letter for publicity purposes if you wish.
(Sgd.) A. E. ROPER,
1 7/12/* 23. Lithgow.
Whether it be in the hands of experts or not, the
Essex can always be relied upon to give efficient,
reliable and economical service at all times.

torian T. M. Burke, who has made a pot of money
in the real-estate business, but is not to change
stables till the A.J.C. Anniversary Handicap has
been disposed of on Jan. 2(5. For that race the
son of All Black-Auraria’s Daughter has Bst. lib.
and double-bettors have coupled his name with that
of everything supposed to have a chance in the
Challenge Stakes, to be rim at Randfwiclc on
Saturday. Sunburst (9st. 81b.) was shaping well
in the Carrington Stakes when his jockey tried to
shove him through an impossible opening, and he
will make things interesting in the Challenge if he
has recovered from the effects of his fall. But it
might be safer to rely on the improving Kilkenny
Lass (7st. 31b.) or one of Booth’s.

A lot of lucre lias been spilt over Gadfly
since the speedy young mare gave K. Godby his
first winning ride at Flemington on Jan. 1. The
daughter of Gadabout was backed at 5 to 4 to
win the Aspendale Plate, but she got badly awa.y
and Threeasta beat her by a neck. At Epsom, four
days later, she was an odds-on favorite, but Comedy
Star, a mare who sometimes threatens to be almost
as good as she looks, beat Gadfly by a head. The
three-year-old ran as though she was beginning to
stale off. Probably she has had enough racing to
last her some time, for last Saturday, when backed
at 5 to 4 for the Sandovvn Park Handicap, she
spoilt her average by running out of a place. The
lug win at Sandown Park was brought off by Elwood
Fisher, who owns and trains Mnemonist. The stable
backed the untalked-of hurdler from 10’s down to 4’s,
and followed up the coup by winning the Two-year-
old race with Some Speed, who bolted and ran a race
on his own before business started.

Lilypond’s victory in the w.f.a. C. B.
Cox Stakes at Perth was his sixth in succession.
“Better than Easingwold and nearly as good as
Eurythmic” is the trainer’s estimate of the big
chestnut who, in appearance, is Lilyveil over again.
Though he races in Jeffery’s nomination, the young-
ster is owned by T. Foy, of Perth. Thirty or forty
years ago Foy’s father was a Ma State jockey, and
he himself has won a race or two on Sydney tracks with
his mare Kola Girl, the fastest pacer in Westralia
and one of the fleetest in the Commonwealth.

P. A. Connolly, the Westralian racing-
man, has been ordered to pay £7OO damages to Darcy,
the jockey, as well as the costs of the most expensive
turf libel case since Hayes v. the Australasian.
After the Final Handicap at last year’s W.A.T.O.
Cup meeting, Connolly asserted that his horse Propa-
gation had been deliberately interfered with by
Darcy on Land of Fog. The complaint was investi-
gated by the three stipendiary stewards, who reported
against it, but Connolly carried his grievance to the
W.A.T.C. committee, submitting signed statements
by three jockeys and weighing in with a further
charge, dating back to 1915, that Darcy had offered
a clerk of the course (now Connolly’s trainer) £290
to take part in a weight-removing swindle —the boy,
it was alleged, was to hand the official about 141 b.
of quicksilver at the barrier and get it back immedi-
ately the horses pulled up after the race, which
Darcy’s mount was to win. Despite the stewards’
report, and without asking for the defence, the
club committee disqualified Darcy for five years.
Thereby it has placed itself in an exceedingly
awkward position, for the jury declared that the
charges were baseless and had been published malici-
ously. The jockey’s reply to the story about the
quicksilver was that he wasn’t in the State when
the proposition was alleged to have been made;
arid when his counsel produced a bottle containing
I3Jlb. of quicksilver, and asked whether a substance
so unwieldy could be handed by one man to
another and back again so as to escape observation
from thousands of binoculars, the allegator looked
as if he would like to change the subject.
“Singemoine”: An impudent scheme to
make the public pay the tax on bookmakers’ tickets
was discussed in Melbourne last week. The idea was
that punters should be sold booklets of six coupons
at 6d. per coupon, and that, as a condition of being-
allowed to bet, each speculator should be required to
hand his bookie a coupon. When a member of the
grocers’ or butchers’ or fruiterers’ ring has to pay
more wages or otherwise increase his expenses, he
lengthens his price for sugar, steak or what not,
but oh a reasonably equitable basis. He does not
take toll of the petty buyer equally with the one
who is catering for a family of half a dozen or for
a hotel, which in principle was what the bookies
proposed to do. The King equivalent of a lengthened
price for foodstuffs is a shortened price about the
uncertain animal that careers from one post to
another under the guidance of an even more uncertain
rider, and the obvious way for the books to make
the public pay the £163,000 which they were
taxed last year is to still further pinch their odds.
Apparently the odds do not admit of added pinching.
The bookies who fathered the betting-ticket device
placed themselves in the position of a Dago who,
realising that his customers can in no wise be
induced to pay more than 3d. apiece for his inferior
peaches, meditates picking- their pockets for his
income-tax money.

A crowd of 7000 thronged Sydney Domain
baths when Andrew Charlton, the sunbrpwned Manly
swimmer, met Borg, the blond giant from Sweden,
for the quarter-mile N.S.W. championship, and about
15,000 couldn’t get in for love or money. It was
a great race for three laps (330 yards), Borg setting
u tremendous pace with the idea of breaking the
boy up. He cut out the first 110 yards in lmin.
6 4-ssee. and the furlong in 2min. 28see. But
the resolute youngster never let him get far away,
and when they turned for the last time, it was
Arne who broke up, Andrew wanning- by the length
of a cricket pitch, with Moss Christie about the
same distance behind Borg. Charlton’s time (smin.
11 4-ssec.) equalled Borg’s world’s record established
in a 25-yards bath; and he wasn’t “all out” at
that. It was a marvellous performance for a youngster
not 17 years old.
Athol Coppleson, a 16-year-old student at Sydney
Grammar, won the 100 yards championship by a
foot from another schoolboy in Ernest Henry, Herald
and Kirkland, whom the judges couldn’t separate,
being inches behind Henry. The time (58 2-ssec.)
was 2 3-ssec. worse than Herald’s trial spin; in
the argot of the turf, the Australian champion left
his race on the track. Still, Coppleson and Henry
(of w-hom Beaurepaire has a great opinion) are
fine young swimmers who are coming on every week
and will help Charlton to regain the swimming sup-
remacy of the globe for this lone outpost of the
paleface.
“Anax”: I don’t want to take any credit from
Andrew' Charlton, who is a world-beater at 440 and
880 yards, but the Sydney swimming authorities
should have shown some consideration for the
Swedish champion in arranging their programme.
No one could have the hardihood to assert that
Borg was in good shape on Saturday for a strenu-
ous quarter-mile. How could he have been? A six-
weeks’ voyage, on which food is served seven times
a day, is the worst preparation for a severe ordeal in
the athletic line. Then Borg didn’t arrive in Syd-
ney till midday on January 4 ; that is to say, he had
eight days in which to become acclimatised and
VIC. RICHARDSON, the South Australian
captain. He made 202 altogether in
the match against N.S.W., and fielded
splendidly.
accustomed to Pacific water (its density is very
different from that of the Baltic and the North Sea),
and to get his muscles and bellows in proper work-
ing order. The thing wouldn’t have been possible
had he gone into strict training right away, and it is
no secret that he spent part of the time sight-seeing
and enjoying generous hotel meals, lie tried to get
fit, on a little swimming and a lot of mast'agei.
Charlton, on the other hand, had been working for
six weeks under the competent eye of Tommy
Adrian, who understands him thoroughly and should
certainly be sent to Paris with him, and was in
perfect _shape. The Swede is too chivalrous a fellow
to attribute his defeat to lack of condition. But
why, in the name of Australian sportsmanship, wasn’t
the 220 yards race held on January 12, and the 440
shifted to the 19th? There is no reason that I can
see why the easiest event on the young’ man’s list
shouldn’t have come first.
A WELL-MATCHED PAIR.
JACK : “I'm awfully keen on golf. I would
rather golf than eat.”
JILL : “Oh, that’s all right — I’d much rather
play than cook.”
The second encounter between N. S. Wales
and South Aus. was finished on the Sydney Cricket
Ground in three days, during which 1264 runs were
scored. Once at least during the match the visitors
looked to be doing excellently; that was when,
batting- first, they had scored 360 for the loss of
only 4 wickets —V. Richardson 135, A. Richardson
90, Bowley 33 and Pritchard 66. It was a start that
might have put any side without a conspicuous
“tail” in good heart and a winning position, but
the last six wickets fell for a wretched 23. Mailey.
with 7 for 133, carried off the bowling honors.
Then the home team went to the creases and piled
up the immense total of 684. Bardsley was the
first to prove his quality with a sound 144, but
the cream of the cricket was provided by Kippax
(248) and Punch (84). When these two were
together the bowling was pasted mercilessly. Of
Kippax’s performance, graceful and vigorous alike, it
can only be said that it puts him in the very front
rank of Australian batsmen. The bowlers, it is true,
never looked very dangerous after the first hour or
two, when Whitty and Arthur Richardson were fresh,
but they pegged away resolutely, and the fielding,
particularly that of Vic. Richardson, was in the main
clean and smart throughout. Whitty, Williams and
A. Richardson were the best of an overworked
quintet, but every wicket they obtained averaged
about 50 runs. The visitors’ second innings again
showed what a sturdy pair the Richardsons are—
“V” made 67 and “A” 41—but they got little
assistance and the total: reached only 197, leaving
the Ma State victors by an innings and 104 runs.
Everett had most to do with the rout, his 6 wickets
costing only 54 runs. Oldfield’s wicket-keeping was
good to watch; Ambler figured creditably, too.
* * * *
“Tren”: In their elation over their triple
victory—Queensland, N. S. Wales- and South Austra-
lia fell before them —the Victorian XI found time
to remember that the Argus had been severe in its
criticisms of the personnel of the team and scathing
in its comments on their slow play. In a spirit of
happy revenge, therefore, they sent a “round robin”
to the cricket writers of that paper, apologising for
making the New Year so unhappy by their victories.
I'hat good old sport Donald McDonald (“Observer”),
though not the chief offender, acknowledged the re-
ceipt of tiie apology and his enjoyment of the joke.
“If you have all the luck 1 seriously wish you
N. S. Wales is in imminent risk of another wallop-
ing, and ‘Observer’ of another ‘robin,’ but,” he
chaffed, “the signatures need not necessarily be the
same.”
* * * *
“Bail” : Surely cricket history contains few
records to surpass that of the Victorian youth,
Ponsford, in first-class matches. Probably owing to
nervousness his encounter with the Englishmen in
1920-21 only yielded 19 and 6. In the next season
he was picked for Victoria against Tasmania, and
whacked up 162. In 1922-23 he paralysed the Speck
with the sensational 429, scored 108 and 17 against
South Australia, and contributed 62 for his State
against the English amateurs. This year he knocked
248 off the Queensland bowling, made 45 and 24
against N.S.W., and then mishandled the Adelaide
trundling to the tune of 81 and 159. His aggregate
to date is 1360 runs, averaging 113.
“.Tamwood”: I am looking forward joyfully
to the row that will start next summer when the
names of the first Test team are announced. Collins,
I suppose, will be captain, and if Jack Gregory is
available he will be the second man picked. Failing
Gregory there will have to be a fast bowler, and at
present there is no rival to Scott. Then Oldfield
is the destined wicketkeeper, and you can’t omit
Kelleway, Macartney, Kippax or Mailey. That
leaves room for only Ryder, Ponsford and Woodfull
from Victoria, and Arthur Richardson from South
Australia. Yet Bardsley, Andrews, Taylor, Hendry
(N. S. Wales), Mayne, Liddicut and Hartkopf (Vic.)
have strong claims and personal followings, and
one of the three selectors has publicly stated that
Hornibrook (Q.) is the finest howler in Australia.
Moreover, if the Sheffield Shield goes south again
there will be a howl for at least equal representa-
tion of Victoria and N. S. Wales. And the battle
will rage again over the choice of the 14 or 15 to
go to England. If I had the selection- of that lot
1 would include Vic. Richardson (S.A.) and Punch
(N.S.W.) on the ground that both would be likely
to do well on wet wickets. Some of our fair-
weather batsmen will look very sick if they strike
a summer as wet as that of 1888.
“Cheezo”: The slowest-falling bail I’ve
seen was in the match S.A. v. Goulburn (N.S.W.).
Yet a few minutes before the bails had been re-
peatedly blown off by the wind. A local man,
Poole, dragged a ball on to the wicket, and a
bail took 10 seconds (I’m on oath) to slide down
to Mother Earth, the wicketkeeper and the
batsman staring at it in dumb amazement. There
was an elongated piece of chewing-gum sticking to
. it and the stump.
* * * *
“Adamascus” : A ball bowled in a recent
match at Rockhampton (Q.) killed a swallow that
was flying across the pitch. The batsman hit the
ball, and, while scoring a run, picked up the bird
and gave it to the umpire at the bowler’s end.
Condition beat Alf Simmons, the English
lightweight, in his Sydney duel with the Belgian
Plees. He was much the better boxer, and one
of his wicked rights sent the Fleming to the floor,
which was more than Godfrey could do, but he
failed to sustain his rallies, being fat and scant of
breath. The referee decided —rightly—in favor of
Plees, but Simmons will be a tough proposition for
any lightweight now before the public when he is
fit to fight.
“Darby K.”: Lean, manager of the Mel-
bourne Stadium, is evidently a diligent student of
The Bulletin. He wants his directors to cut out
20-round bouts, which are dreary when the combat-
ants “stall” half their time and dangerous when
they fight to the point of exhaustion, and substitute
a 10- and a 12-rounder, with preliminaries. At
present each party to a 20-round infliction or horror
receives 25 p.c. of the gross. Lean’s proposal is
that the winner of the 12-rounder should collect
18 p.c. of the gross and the loser 12 p.c., the
winner of the 10-rounder getting 12 p.c. and the
loser 8 p.c. The preliminary smiters would be paid
out of the management’s 50 p.c. This would certainly
be a lot fairer than the existing arrangements, and
it would furnish more exciting and less hazardous
sport. But no scheme can be regarded as satis-
factory unless it provides for (1) the insurance of
pugilists, at the promoter’s cost, against the risk
of death or disablement in the ring, and (2) a
liberal increase in the wages of four- six- and eight-
round fighters. In the process of providing fat
purses for the privileged few who get 20-round
engagements, preliminary boxers have been atroci-
ously sweated.
* * * *
“15-30”: More than ordinary interest
attaches to the forthcoming tennis championships in
Melbourne. The story goes that Brookes is ambitious
of appearing in another Davis Cup series and would
like Anderson as a colleague in the doubles. That
Norman is contemplating big practice is shown by
the fact that he is leaving for England and the
Continent at the beginning of next month, and
wilt be seen on the Riviera and probably at Wimble-
don. But even if he and Anderson defeat Patterson
and O’Hara Wood next week there will remain a doubt
as to whether his" stamina is equal to the strain of
a succession of international tussles. He is not
so old as Roper Barrett, but he is getting on.
Good judges question whether his eye is as quick,
his brain as nimble, and his placing as pretty as
m the heyday of his achievement 15 years ago.
“Coot”: Royal tennis (B. 3/l/’24) was
introduced in the Speck long before it became estab-
lished in Melbourne. In 1874 the first court was
built in Hobart by Smith Travers. It was supposed
to have been modelled on the famous
.James-street court in London, but Travers evidently
trusted to memory for some of the dimensions,
for they had to be put right by Thomas Stone, then
a recent arrival from England, who had played the
game since 1850. The Melbourne court was opened
in April, 1882, by the Marquis of Normanby. It
cost £6OOO ; and so well was the work done (Stone,
still alive and hearty, was responsible for it) that
it has never had to be repaired.
* * * *
“Rio”: O. G. H. Merrett, who will man-
age Australia’s Olympic team, is an example of
what physical culture and open air will do for a
moderate physique. Slightly built and of medium
height, “Ossie” as a boy did not give promise of
becoming an all-round athlete. But Mosman’s aquatic
advantages and the old St. Clement’s gymnasium
developed him into a first-class gymnast, swimmer,
open-boat sailor and Rugby footballer. He has
held office in many clubs, and is a life-member of
several surfing and life-saving bodies, besides which
he has found time to build up a prosperous manu-
facturing business. Two sons have earned blues at
the “Shore” Grammar School.
* * * #
“Cam West” ; Rowing is something more
than a pas-time on the Murray. After a regatta at
Renmark (S.A.) on December 31, an eight-oar boat
from Berri was pulled back to the irrigation settle-
ment, a distance of 30 miles upstream. The crew
completed their task in hours and stopped onlv
once to empty their boat, it having been flooded
by the wash of a passing river-steamer.

George Dempsey, another of the remark-
able crop of youngsters now coming into prominence
m Sydney sport, won the half-mile and 10 miles
State cycling championships on Monday—the sprint
in lmin. 9 4-ssec„ and the other in 26min. All the
best amateurs, including G. Thursfield, the S’African,
were behind his flying wheel. Next week’s Austral-
asian championship meeting, at which Dempsey, Cop-
pins, Burness and Scotton will appear for the Ma State,
will decide whether anyone has a better right than
George to represent Australia in the cycling events
at Paris.
“J.H.” (London) : The real trouble with
the Rugby Union game in Britain is that its control
is in the hands of a lot of old fogeys with early -
Victorian prejudices on th e subject of professionalism.
A new broom, wielded by younger men, is badly
needed. The old ’uns go off like a packet of crackers
about “broken time,” presentations and so forth,
but are blandly indifferent to the exploitation by
Oxford and Cambridge men of the fame they have
won at cricket and football. If you are a “blue,” a
pleasant and remunerative job' as a games-master
at any of the Public Schools is easily obtainable.
The old ’uns see nothing reprehensible' in this, but
if a working-man from Wales accepts a watch or
a cigarette-case from fellow townsmen the sacred
principles of amateurism are infringed beyond recall.
THE BOOKIE’S WEIGHT-CLOTHS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A meeting of bookmakers at Tatt.’s Club, Mel-
bourne, rejected a motion that the betting tax should
lie passed on to the public by means of coupons, which
the backer would buy in booklets on the course and
hand to the bookmaker on making his bet. One dis-
gusted fielder declared he wasn’t going to be bothered
with coupons; ‘it took him all his time to carry his
notes home.’ (Loud laughter.)”
Cumber him not with coupons who must move
Loaded to Plimsoll line along the track
For home, as ’tis. The extra weight might prove
The final straw that breaks the camel’s back.
Already stuff’d to bursting is his bag
With many a care-free punter’s erstwhile store ;
See how he sweats and how his shoulders sag!
He cannot carry more.
The horse that strains in vain his load to draw
S.P.C.A. inspectors will befriend
In city thoroughfares. There is a law
That lumpers should not be required to bend
Their massive torsos ’neath a wheat-sack’s weight
That might the muscles rick or health impair.
Is there no limit in a Christian State
To what a book must bear?
How many of us wear a pinching shoe
And show the world a face of jovial cheer!
Deem not a fielder’s life is, through and through,
Perpetual skittles and unending beer.
You envy him, be-diamonded and plump,
In linen fine and gorgeous raiment clad,
But none the less he has his cross to hump
The same as you, my lad.
Cumber him not with coupons, lest you learn
The limits of his patience have been passed.
The worm that’s trodden on too oft will turn,
Even the cornered rat will fight at last.
Pile no more burdens on him, or at length
lie’ll quit and leave the betting to the totes.
Poor devil! Already it taxes all his strength
To carry home his notes.

The Bulletin
Died in Sydney, at 67, Holden Day, of
Hunter’s Hill, youngest son of the lab-
Edward Denny Day, one-time Police Magis
trate at Maitland—-he who, in 1841, followed
up with a party the Jew Boy’s gang in
the Liverpool Ranges, and, after a battle,
captured seven of the gang, most of whom
were hanged in the gaol-yard in Lower
George-,street in March of that year.
Colonel Guy Macaulay Mort, whose death
is reported from London, was son of the
late Thomas S. Mort, whose statue stands
in front of Sydney Exchange. The Colonel’s
mother had been a Miss Macaulay; she was
Mort’s second wife. The son joined the
Sth Royal Irish Hussars in 1898 as 2nd
lieutenant, and was in his 47th year at the
end.
John Macdonald, who numbers his years
at 100, has lived 75 of them in one town—
Maude, near Geelong (Vic.). He is an Aus-
tralian native, having been born in the Mur-
rumbidgee (N.-S.W.) area, still has a full
set of home-grown teeth, and is active enough
to look after all his own affairs —and resent
any interference with them.
“O’Ren” : Recent pars, re native-born R.C.
bishops omitted mention of Dr. Norton, the
late Bish. of Port Augusta (8.A.). A Vic-
torian by birth, he ’verted to Rome early in
life, and wore.the episcopal hat for 17 years.
He shepherded a large flock, built churches and
schools every chance he got. and surveyed a
see that stretches from the Westralian border
to N.S.W.
McGregor, the elderly M.L.A. for Ballarat
East, once more introduced his bill to amend
a clause in the Local Government Act dis-
franchising ratepayers who fail to part up
by a stated date. Several times the little
measure has gone through the popular House,
only to be repelled by the Council, and once
it; was its unique fate to be accepted by the
Uppah Chambah and ordered off in “the
other place.” This time the Government
frowned upon it, and a vital clause was de-
feated, so McGregor bore it away. After
27 years he seemed quite used to it.
Maoriland’s retiring police-superintendent
Marsack is a Frenchman who has viewed the
world from various angles. He learned the
ways of ships on the Worcester along with
Admiral Togo; then, joining Adamson and
Co., w r ho were running a line to Bananaland,
he secured his mate’s certificate —and took
himself to farming in North Canterbury
(M.L.). Thence he drifted into the Armed
Constabulary, and finally (in 1889) into plain
John-Hoppery. He did some good detective
work, and made a name for himself in the
Ariadne wrecking swindle and the Stycfie
poisoning case. Marsack’s war fervor was
distinctly Gallic —he lost his son in the
Rig Commotion —and Wellington grinned on
Armistice Day when, in the pub which a
far-seeing Providence has placed alongside
Police Headquarters, he tore a ragged hole
in the unpopular anti-shouting regulations.
“Eldorado”: John Egg was the whitest
Chinaman who ever left the Flowery Land
to settle in Australia. It was he who, in
the ’fifties, baked the dampers for Capt.
Cadell, master of the Lady Augusta, the first
steamer to navigate the Murray from tin'
mouth to Albury, thereby earning the Gov-
ernment’s reward of £l5OO. John after-
wards owned two steamers himself —the
Prince Alfred and the Murrumbidgee—and a
store in Wentworth. It was also he who stood
beside the coffin of fireman Eastwood (who
met his death through a gauge-glass burst-
ing), and after hearing the sympathy given
to the unfortunate man’s wife, thus addressed
the group: “You only say ‘Me solly.’ That
no good. I say ‘Me solly twenty pong.’"
And as John was writing the cheque the
others took the hint and considered
the financial value of tlieir respective sym-
pathies. Two of Egg’s sons inherited the
ability of their sire—Jack became a wealthy
Victorian bookmaker and another was a
Customs officer.
“R.F.K.F.”: The two copper pennies found
under Brisbane’s new Queen-street Arcade
recall some early Australian money troubles.
Over a century ago, when “calabashes” of
varied and wonderful designs were commonly
circulated, pennies were almost unobtain-
able. A proclamation issued in 1800 by Gov-
ernor King explained that George 111., “tak-
ing into gracious consideration the great incon-
venience caused thereby to all classes of his
subjects in this colony,” was about to send a
cargo of pennies by the armed ship Porpoise.
“When a sufficient quantity of copper coin
has been received in this colony,” rumbles on
the proclamation, “no private notes or cards
(calabashes) will be allowed to circulate."
These George 111. pennies were reckoned as
worth 2d. in Australia. Other tokens of
that day included johannas, “duckets,” dol-
lars, guelders and pagodas, all of which were
listed, along with their respective colonial
values, in Governor King’s famous Table of
Specie published in 1800. In spite of re-
peated shortages, Australia did not mint its
own coppers until the year 1919. One of
the pennies just dug up in Brisbane is dated
1834, and is larger than those now' coined.
“The Sacristan” : Father Tommy O’Dwyer,
whose place at Riverview College is
being taken by Father Lockington, will
probably go back to St. Patrick’s, East
Melbourne, of which he was the head
before he went to Riverview 7 . Inci-
dentally, the present allocation of Jesuit
Rectorships by the Order has set an
example which many R.C.’s think might be
developed by the hierarchy. The head Jesuit
in Westralia, the rectors of Xavier and St-
Pat.’s and the vice-rector of Newman Col-
lege within the Melbourne ’Varsity are all
Australians. But practically all the adminis-
trative positions open to secular priests are
held by Irishmen, and it is hard for the
Manly-trained padres to get a look in. With
two exceptions the Australian Bench of
Bishops is composed of Irishmen. They pre-
fer the product of Maynooth to the Rev. Fr.
Billjim. Elderly wearers of the episcopal
purple in Australia almost invariably secure
the appointment of an Irish coadjutor cum
jure successionis, and this destroys the Aus-
tralian priests’ chance of elevation to the sees
concerned. When Dr. Mannix thinks be
needs a coadjutor it is a moral certainty
that he will want the job to go to a May-
nooth cleric (notwithstanding his “Australia
First” slogan) unless Rome, which is said
to turn now 7 a very cold eye on these attempts
to keep the native clergy in the ranks, nips
the design in the bud.

Sydney turned out in great numbers to
greet “The Merry Widow” on her reappear-
ance at Her Majesty’s on Saturday; and
it s safe to say that the inner eye of half
the house was as much with the Sonias of
other days as with Gladys Moncrieff, who
had slipped into the shoes of the lucky lady
with 20 millions and no husband. No Sonia
Sydney has heard was better equipped vocally
for the part; but in Miss Moncrieff there
is no sparkle of comedy. In the tense
moments her singing and acting swept the
listeners away, but the light wine of her
part was not beaded at the brim —it poured
out more like still Burgundy. Andrew Ilig-
ginson, with practically no voice, was the
swaggering, debonair princeling—one hates
to think one missed seeing him 10 or 15
years younger. In that Marsovian uniform
in the second act he is nothing short of a
.home-wrecker ; and when he swings into the
famous waltz number, every jazz-girl in the
audience felt that mother’s parties must have
had a hectic spot or two in them, after all.
Cecil Bradley as Natalie was at her best.
Her lover De Jolidon (Herbert Browne) was
a nightingale in voice, but not a bit of a
bird otherwise. Had Stigant really been
Popoff the Marsovian embassy would have
rivalled Maxim's in popularity. Reginald Pur-
dell as the amorous Nisch, and Clarice Hard-
wicke as a dainty Frou-Frou, with Fi-Fi,
Lo-Lo, Do-Do, Jou-.Tou. Clo-Clo and Zo-Zo,
helped to re-weave the fascinating music and
lyrics of Lehar and Adrian Ross.

“Rockets,” the revusieal pantomime which
has enabled Sydney to take Lorna and Toots
Pounds to its capacious heart, continues its
coruscating way at the Grand Opera House.
It’s a medley of mirth and melody at pre-
war prices.
“His House in Order,” with Irene Van-
brugh and Dion Boucicault at their best,
might have gone on filling Sydney Cri. for
weeks, from all indications. But playhouses
and hangings must run to schedule, and
another eight nights are all that can 'oe
spared for this admirably presented piece.
“Mr. Pim Passes By”, succeeds.

still proving a thoroughly satisfying contri-
bution to the Yuletide season. Oscar is
entering on his final lap as a heavy-weight
pirate; on Saturday week the curtain will
rise to reveal Madge Elliott and Alfred
Frith in “Kissing Time.”
Sydney Tivoli patrons are still being
treated to liberal doses of syncopated classics
by Bert Ralton’s Havana Band, and, what
is more, they are taking it kindly. The
latest intruders, Maud Courtney and Mr. C.,
are a pair of quick-witted, nimble-tongued
artists whose forte is a pleasant flow of
topical chatter. Dialect comedienne Estelle
Rose prattles so about the foibles of Ikey Mo
that she hastened to inform Saturday night’s
audience, with its large sprinkling of Jewry,
that there was really nothing personal about
her remarks. The Moulin Rouge Instrumen-
tal Trio, a depressing and unattractive

crowd, staged “The Retreat from Moscow”
to the accompaniment of much cracking of

and Marjorie contribute their evergreens to
the bunch.
" The. Exciters, at Sydney Globe, lives up
to its title. Bebe Daniels is born in an ex-
press train, and thereafter speeds around at
<lO miles an hour collecting a hubby before
she is old enough to vote. "Jazzmania,” at
the Strand, is causing heartburn. It con-
cerns a Balkan kingdom and an absconding
queen, who learns to one-step and fox-trot
in her years of exile, and with her added
knowledge returns to save her country. An
excellent picture for emotional duennas,
Lyceum clients arc worked up over “The
Woman He Married,” a curry compounded
of disinherited sons, artists’ models and
corpses. The recipe for “Sisters,” at tin;
same house, is simpler. Take two sisters,
marry eacli to the man of the other’s choice
—and let simmer. “The Man Who Won,”
at the Empress, shows Dustin Farnum put-
ting a spoke in the wheel of a wife-abduc-
tor. Hoyt’s grows rich on “Old Dad,”
wherein the heroine is expelled from college
and marries a bigamous millionaire. “The
Merry-Go-Round”—same shelter —deals with
the heart-beatings of an organ-grinderess and
a member of the Austrian peerage. “If
Winter Comes” is proving one of the best
harvests the Crystal Palace has had.

Twenty operas are listed for production by
the Firm during the season commencing in
Melbourne in March, and several of these,
like “Andre Chhnier,” will be new to Aus-
tralia. Sixteen Aveeks will be divided be-
tween the two big capitals, and if there is
some substantial guarantee of support in
Brisbane and Adelaide a fortnight each in
those cities may be added to the programme.
The reiterated managerial statements that
the whole business is a gamble excites guf-
fawing incredulity; still, the expenses will
be £5OOO a Aveek, and that will take a lot of
getting, considering that the artists, with the
exception of Melba and Dal Monte, are
practically unknown. There is no certainty
that Dal Monte wi 11 draw full houses after
the surprise of her soprano has worn off;
and, anyway, neither she nor Melba can
appear oftener than three times a week. More-
over, Melba’s fascination is practically
limited to her impersonations of Mimi and
Marguerite, though she is understood to
threaten a performance as Desdemona in
Verdi’s “Otello,” which seems never to have
been staged in its entirety here; so the pos-
sibility of the Australian failing to attract
a bumper audience at every appearance is
not utterly ridiculous. In the circumstances
the Firm is undoubtedly risking a good deal
of money.
Little Nellie Kelly,”'" at" Melbourne Prin-
cess s, and “Aladdin,” at Her Majesty’s, near
by, have sloAvcd down to two matinees a
W'eek instead of six. The pace Avas begin-
ning to tire the slum's and distress the per-
formers, so this abatement in fierceness of
competition will be good for everybody, in-
cluding audiences. A certain amount of
vivacity had faded from the extraordinary
party which a deadly serious young million-
aire gave to the drapery emporium where
Nellie K. did no work for a living, whilst at
Her Majesty’s the girls were clouded o’er
with the don’t-care expression of overworked
charmers who are indifferent as to whether
anybody sees them with legs bare or other-
wise.
At: Melbourne P'alace the old rule of daily
matinees, instituted by the Fullers for the
punishment of their company’s sins, is
approved by people in whom appetite for
afternoon shows grows more and more raven-
ous. An audience at a Fullerian panto,
seems to chew the goods and know exactly
what it is eating. Women talk about par-
ticular items in the bill as though they had
previously looked them over in the shop and
selected them. When a well-worn variety
turn comes along—and “Mother Goose” is
largely a medley of familiar vaudeville
offects—they greet its appearance with a
verbal handshake and a shout of recognition.
Also, they give the kiddies to understand
that now is the time to be exceptionally
happy. And the muezzin, in his little wooden
temple, cries “Standing room only!”

“French Leave” is about to cease present-
ing Emelie Polini at a grave disadvantage,
disadvantages being grave with the Polini
lady when she plays frivolous heroines
foreign to her method. The coming change
of programme will also terminate “A Night
at an Inn,” and put a stopper on the graven
image that comes Ml the way from India to
choke Frank Harvey and his mates on the
mat. ; The curtain-raiser at Melbourne
King’s is interesting because it makes a hrave
attempt to reach a gruesome goal, and com-
mands sympathy for missing the ’bus, or,
rather, the hearse. Its intentions are strictly
appalling. Of nine human beings who
arc actually seen or talked of in the one-
act thriller, not a soul survives curtain-fall,
presuming that the image deals with Harvey
according to his misdeeds. The play for
Saturday is “My Lady’s Dress,” and in this
revival Miss Polini will be farewelled for
10 nights, saith the advt.

At Melbourne Playhouse managerial com-
plaints of insufficient patronage for Aus-
tralian Grand Opera were not all in vain.
More money came along, and the rather mon-
otonous announcement of “The Barber of
Seville ’ as next opera on the programme
promises to be at last justified by events.
Meanwhile the management holds on to
“Hansel and Gretel,” witli its bright girl
principals and its giant basso-baritone, Wil-
liam Reid, who is the most promising vocal-
ist of them all and a born comedian when
required. The performance, despite crudi-
ties of staging and the startling extrava-
gance of the Witch’s nose, is a restful oasis
of real music, in a Melbourne desert of rag-
time jazz, while the effect of angels in white
nighties descending the steps that lead from
cloudland is at least not less impressive than
a lot of bold girls coming down golden stairs
in a panto, scene.

Hoyt’s advt. in Melbourne insists on the
sublime pfithos and beauty of “Merry-Go-
Round,” a well-pkotoed tale of pre-war Aus-
tria wherein the noble Prince Maximilian
casts a beaming eye on a Cinderella girl. Of
course, he belongs to the proud Hapsburgs,
and his ancient parent foams with fury when
he hears of the affair, finishing up a long
outburst by ordering the youth to wed the
magnificent Princess von Aschtipp, whose
ancestry bloats the Almanach de Gotha; but
the war intervenes and various circumstances
too numerous to mention enable the hero to
clasp the quivering maiden to his beribboned
chest. Over the way at Hoyt’s Gaiety Wil-
liam Desmond wears two coats of imitation
tan and demonstrates thrilling mastery of a
tame mustang as “McGuire of the Mounted.”
A Front-page Story” is the artless fiction
heading the list of features at the Majestic.
It tells how enemies are made friends accord-
ing to one of the card-indexed plots of the
Vitagraph studio. The manner in which
Innocence can see books in the bounding
crooks and good in everything is related with
affecting sentimentality in “For Those We
Love.” “Pioneer Trails” is flourishing its
feathers and scalp-knives at the Britannia,
whilst at the Melba Laurette Taylor is pre-
cipitating herself at a handsome hero in
“Peg o’ My Heart.”

Adelaide Prince of Wales’s has opened for
a short season with Brandon-Cremer in some
fine old crusted farces whose hero must bear
the name of Ilummingtop or something like
that. He has been greatly assisted by the
natural acting of Walter Cornock, the Blokt.
At the Royal Nellie Bramley is intense in
gold old ‘‘Paid in Full.” George Bryant
scores in his old part of the sea captain, and
Georgo Hewlett leaves his usual fruity humor
to give a good rendering of the spineless
young husband. The Majestic programme is
strong on the musical side, but Cestria does
some acrobatic work that is funny as well is
clever. Of pictures, Hurley’s Papua series
is the best; it is at West’s. The York
attracts with Warren Kerrigan in the strenu-
ous “Thundering Dawn,” and Wondergrapli
with Madge Kennedy in. a Purple Highway.
Of the two jolly outdoor shows one speaks
with sympathy. The coldest and most blus-
tering January on the local record is right
up against them.
“E.T.” : There is no pleasing old-fashioned
mummers with modern productions. The
adventures of “Thersites” (B. 3/l/’24) in
search of a satisfying evening’s amusement
supply fresh evidence on the point. “The
Spanish Main” excited the veteran’s derision
because of the claim that it was put on in
“only 10 days.” These pitiable incompetents
of present-day producers! “I myself played
leads in drama for about six months on
end,” he tells us, “and changed the bill twice

a week!” Well, if it comes to that, the pre-
sent writer has played “juvenile leads” for
many whirling weeks in a booth and the
hill was changed every night. But I do not
boast about it and would hesitate to assert
that the standard of production was up to
that of “The Spanish Main.” As “Thersitcs"
persists in the statement that on the occa-
sion he honored “Othello” with a visit, “Mr.
Asche did stand dead-centre with his back
turned square on the Duke,” I can only sug-
gest that the old ’un’s eyes played him false.
Why do I butt in? Well, I was the Duke.
The Henry Lawson Memorial Fund.
The following appeal, issued from the Public
Library of N. S. Wales, has been made on
behalf of this fund :
A committee representing all classes of the com-
munity was formed to collect funds for a Henry
Lawson Memorial. It is proposed that this should
take the form of a statue placed, if possible, in the
Sydney Domain near that of Bobbie Burns.
* With us, recognition of our writers has been
tardy—our best have borne the burden of poverty.
In a century of eager and active life, Australia
has done many fine things, but not its least important
production has been the work of this man. A nation
lives in its art and literature. In Lawson we live,
because he spoke for us. Lawson spoke in the
authentic voice of this continent; his writings are
our word to the world, and our message to the
greater Australia of the future. In erecting a
memorial worthy of him, w r e do honor to ourselves,
to our country, and to our own faith in the destiny
of our race.
The call to assist in such a national undertaking
is a clear and definite test of our own value as
citizens of an Australian Commonwealth. Henry
Lawson’s place in our literature requires no argument.
Let us rise to the call and make the memorial
itself a memorable achievement.
If your name is not already among those of the
subscribers to the Fund, the lists are still open.
If you are poor, as Lawson was, give what little
you can afford, but give to honor the dead poet and
yourself.
Subscriptions may be sent to this office; or
to the lion, sec., the Public Library, Sydney;
or to Miss Rose Scott. Jersey-road, Wool-
lahra; or to IL E. Boote, the Worked,
Sydney. W. 11. Ifould, N.S.W. Public
Librarian, is chairman of the. organising
committee, which includes Prof. Le Gay
Brereton, Lawrence Campbell, J. T. Lang,
Labor leader in the N.S.W. Parliament; J.
Jackson, M.L.A.; and Charles Lloyd.

THE ARTIST : “Don't you ever wish that you
painted pictures yourself?”
THE MODEL: “No. I’m afraid I wouldn't
care to sacrifice my profession merely
for the sake of art.”
On grand opera and f s. d.: —
Tallis’s statement regarding the costly experi-
ences of the .r. C. Williamson firm with grand opera
doesn’t explain the conditions under which losses
were arrived at. “The late Martin Simonsen,” it is
asserted, “vainly struggled with Italian opera at
the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, under our manage-
ment.” What Simonsen did was to import a capital
company on the strength of a subscription amounting
to about £4OOO. He rented the Alexandra Theatre
cheaply, had the cheaper parts of the big barn
crowded every night, and made the venture pay in
Melbourne and Sydney for the six months of the co.’s
original engagement. Then, when all the novelty of
the voices was exhausted and the repertoire had
became familiar, J.C.W. stood in with Simonsen
for a prolongation of the Melbourne season. This
series of revivals at the Royal was bound to have
a result different from that of the original season
at the Alexandra. The firm made an evident
“bloomer” in risking it. Another Italian opera co.
Mine to grief under Simonseri’s management in
1891, Signora Cuttica being the principal lyric
soprano. J.C.W. took this over for a short season
after the smash, but Tallis made no mention of
how the brilliant Cuttica and co. fared at Melbourne
Princess s. It was a later experiment in Italian
opera which he remembered. “Our next venture was
at the Princess’s, somewhere about the ’nineties”—
189 d to be precise—“with ‘Pagliacci’ and ‘Cavalleria
Rusticana,’ then creating a big sensation in Europe.
These works were splendidly introduced for the first
time to Australia, with a complete Italian company
of principals, but the result was a heavy loss.” The
fact is that a company of half a dozen singers, or
so, started off unpromisingly, the tenor being so
hoarse that his efforts were depressing. lie pre-
sently recovered from his hoarseness, but never re-
vealed a voice for anybody to write home about.
The two short operas were not produced on the
same night. Each was staged for two or three weeks
at a time in conjunction with “Turquoisette,”
otherwise known as the Blue Ballet. Two solo
dancers Bartho and D’Argo—-were imported, also
a musical conductor from London. Furthermore there
were eight foreign coryphees and 80 pairs of young
Australian legs. The Blue Ballet had at
least as much to do with the season’s heavy loss as
the small portions of grand opera that preceded the
dancing. As for the Sapio-Dani combination,
it commenced in Melbourne in the middle of wintei
when Her Majesty’s Theatre was repellently cold;
also the self-styled musical world, being under
German domination arid in sympathy with Mus-
grove (who had been producing Wagnerian opera and
was preparing to import a full German co.), helped
all it could to queer the Italian season. J.C.W.’s
experiments in grand-opera production have not been
financially encouraging, but the history of them all
was not illuminatively given in the J.C.W. report.
Bad judgment, bad management and bad luck hare
had to do with the bad losses.
“0.K.”: Rigo does wisely in announcing
that his Australian Grand Opera Co. will
not be able to carry on unless financial sup-
port is supplied somehow. When you are
trying to establish grand opera on a very
small capital you must talk £ s. d. to the
public all the time. But in complaining that
the public has no reason for staying away
from Melb. Playhouse, the Italian impresario
talks through his soft-felt hat. After all,
the Playhouse is an uninviting little place.
The auditorium is not large enough to hold a
profitable audience at cheap rates. The
orchestra is too expensive (it costs £3OO a
week) as well as too loud. The stage is
narrow, and the house ill-furnished. Added
to which drawbacks is the circumstance that
a majority of the class of persons who attend
grand-opera shows without enjoying them,
because it is the correct thing' to affect an
interest in opera, or are really among the
"cultured few” who enjoy grand opera in
moderation, are just now out of Melbourne
for holiday purposes. Brother Rigo protests
that his deserving entertainment would be
immensely popular in any other house. He
protests too much. Living among an opera-
tic clique he is biased. But he cannot go
wrong in appealing for solid cash support.
The policy of Art is to keep on screaming
tor public appreciation and financial en-
couragement.
“0.K.” gives Kate Terry her send-off: —
_ Ka t e Terry’s career as an actress closed in 1867.
No living critic can therefore authoritatively endorse
or deny the opinion that she was a sweet young'
artist, who lacked the “force” of the older school
of actresses of her time, but was charming' in the
more modern way. Kate, although now declared to
have been born in 1844 and married when she was 23,
appears in the “Dramatic List” of 1870 as having-
been born in 1842. She certainly played Cordelia
to Charles Kean’s King Lear in 1858. Still, let it be
supposed she was only 25 when she married Lewis, of
the fashionable drapery firm of Lewis and Allenby, and
that Ellen, six years her junior, was then only 19.
Mrs. Lewis had no sooner left the stage than she
desired to retire sister Ellen into the “moral safety”
of private life. Lewis was wealthy, and Kate, truth
to tell, took to snobbishness with avidity. Her parents
had had a pretty hard life in the “profession,”
and she saw only the gilded side of the difference
between a rich draper and a poor player. So Ellen
was persuaded by her elder sister and her new
brother-in-law to retire from the stage as wife of her
grave and gifted admirer, G. F. Watts, the painter.
She was but a young thing—perhaps not older than
the 19 the “Dramatic List” would make her out to
have been —and she had done little more than sug-
gest, in a few characters, that she was the natural
successor to charming Kate. Watts, already a rising
painter, had become infatuated with the elfish Ellen,
and had made such inspired sketches of her as any
girl might be won by—in a measure. So Ellen
became Mrs. Watts, to the huge satisfaction of the
Lewises. The fat was soon in the fire. Devoted to his
work, Watts wanted the society of artists, men
mostly older than himself. Nor . had he been a
chicken when he took the golden-haired damsel to
wife. They did not get on well together. The
bride found her highly respectable domestic life a
deadly dull change from all the existence she had
known up to then. She soon protested against the
boredom of playing hostess to her husband’s circle of
acquaintance. There came a day when he insisted
that on this particular occasion, at least, she should
preside at the head of the dining-table. All the
guests were assembled before hostess Ellen appeared
—in the costume of Titania, the Fairy Queen! Then
was Watts persuaded that, having made a terrible
mistake, lie had better let his bride go her own way.
Under the deed of separation he undertook to allow
Ellen £3OO a year as long as she kept off the stage,
the allowance to be reduced to £2OO a year if she
resumed business as an actress. Watts went back
to his easel, whilst the emancipated Ellen retired to a
pretty village 20 miles from London. After six or
seven years from the time of her marriage she re-
turned to the stage. Her husband, however, appeared
to remain ignorant of her whereabouts until Tom
Taylor, the dramatist, who had been best man at the
wedding, talked seriously to him about certain mat-
ters of common report. So the tale of uncongenial
marriage and its after-results was told in the divorce
court, and Ellen Terry lost her chance of becoming
a baronet’s widow ere she died. Doubtless sister
Kate in after years deplored the loss of a baronetage
to the family, whereas Ellen, impulsive, emotional,
cynical Ellen, lias deplored nothing.
“D.”: “The Spanish Main,” at Sydney
Royal, presents the most incredible of all
pirate chiefs. “The Vulture,” who is re-
putedly the master in villainy of all Steven-
son’s horrors rolled into one, suffers repeated
insults and assaults from Oscar Asche, a
rollicking young 20-stone Irishman. After
each attack the Vulture’s men fall on Asche
and tie him up. There are wrongs that
OBSERVATION.
“That’s stale news! I knew they were married weeks ago.”
“How did you know?”
“Why, they go into the sixpenny seats at the pictures note!”
the mildest cleric might be expected to want
to wipe out in blood, and when the Vulture
is hit on the head with a bottle in a bar
he suffers one of them. Yet the snarling
desperado does nothing when the inevitable
tying-np follows. He even refrains from put-
ting the boot in once or twice, as any self-
respecting bottle-oh would do as a matter
of course. Presumably Oscar, as author of
the play, decided against having his person
mishandled even in the interests of veri-
similitude. A greater artistic mistake could
not have been made. No member of the
criminal classes is capable of keeping his
hands off an assailant who has been rendered
harmless, and least of all a professional
assassin of Dago origin living in the violent
period when piracy was in {tower.
“Mancam” : Alice Rees (B. 10/l/'24) was
the original Patience in the Australian pro-
duction of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera
of that name in ’B2. Howard Vernon was
Reginald Bunthorne, Verdi was Grosvenor,
Adrienne Novarro was Lady .fane; Riceardi,
Armas Beaumont and John Forde were the
Colonel, Duke and Major respectively. Alice
Rees having gone, the only one left is
John Forde, who has lately been giving
a picturesque study of Father Christophero
fa priest) in “A Southern Maid” at Sydney
Majesty's.
‘'Nella” : Henry Vibart. the mummer who
in the Cold Land made his 10,000 th appear-
ance on the stage lately, was here with
H. B. Irving in 3911. He was Father
Walter in “The Bells.” Francois de Paule
in “Louis NI.” and the Ghost in “Hamlet,”
amongst other things.
“F.A.”: I disagree with “Borom” (B.
10/l/’24) as to the origin of “getting the
bird.” My notion is that the phrase origi-
nated on the European continent, where it
has long been the custom to signify dis-
approval of a mummer by delivering a series
of long, low whistles. The practice was ram-
pant in Egyptian vaudeville houses during
the war, and the whistling was generally
confined to foreign members of the audiences.
I have heard it in the Fog, too. “In the
garden” was an expression with a similar
meaning (it related to vegetable donations
from the front of the house), but it is now
seldom heard.
“T.P.”: That Aucklander’s reference (B,
27/12/’23) to Mrs. Sharman (Juliet Wray)
carried me back to the 'nineties, when Juliet
Flegeltaub played lead at Ballarat in an
Australian play written by Alf Lumsdeu.
Alf was a good conjurer—he afterwards
toured as "Carl Czerny”—but there have
been finer dramatists: Dan Barry, for in-
stance. In reviewing Alf’s forgotten tliree-
acter, Ellis, of the Star, tempered justice
with mercy, but Juliet be described as a
young woman with a future. Ballarat was
rather incredulous, but within 12 months
Juliet “Wray” was a popular favorite in
Melbourne.
“1.5.”: “Stabbard Lyte’s” gibes at Aus-
tralian dramatic critics were justified. With
few exceptions they are unofficial publicity-
men for commercial concerns or chroniclers
of green-room gossip. Recently in Melbourne
the Pioneer Players put on Louis Esson’s
“The Drovers,” a play that has been listed
by the British Drama League among its 100
best, ancient or modern. Herbert Farjeon,
the Saturday Review critic, described it as
the most moving little drama he had come
across in recent years. But the Argus dis-
missed it in three lines as being “too faint,’’
and the Age ignored it completely.
“Cyrano” : Recent pars about curtain-calls
remind me of a performance of “A Woman
of No Importance.” The rag fell imme-
diately after the scene wherein the young
man goes to strike
Lord Illingworth and
is stopped by the cry,
“He is your father!"
It was hardly down
before it was raised
to disclose the per-
sons in this tense
situation standing in
a line, out of char-
acter. The audience
was denied sufficient
time to take in the
climax which the
dramatist had care-
fully developed. I
went away full of
wrath and wrote a
protest, but was cen-
sured with heavy con-
tempt by an older
critic, who told me I
didn’t know what I
was talking about.
The illusion, lie said,
ceased the moment the
curtain fell. I coun-
tered with the ques-
tion whether the illu-
sion would not suffer
if the curtain rose on
Hamlet and the rest
standing slack in the
middle of the stage
immediately after the
tremendous tension of
the Play scene; but the veteran maintained
his ground.
“Harquen” : Touching the revival of “The
Merry Widow,” five actors now in Australia
were in the London production at Daly’s in
1007. Theodore Leonard followed George
Graves as Popoff; Leslie Holland took
over W. H. Berry’s part of Nisch;
Howett Worster was Danilo for a
time, and afterward toured in the
part; Grafton Williams succeeded Freddy
Kaye as Novokovieh; and Haigh Jackson
played de Jolidon when Robert Evett was
transferred to “The Waltz Dream.” Coyne
was. the original London Danilo, and Aus-
tralia would have been glad to dispense with
“Nightie Night” and “His Lady Friends"
could it have seen him in the old role three
years ago. “But ah!” he said, when the
subject was broached, “I’m fifty-four.”
“Hamfat” : The rumpus between the organ-
ised theatrical employees and the Ward-
Fuller management recalls the first delega-
tion of actor-unionists that waited upon an
Australian management with demands. It
happened 12 years ago, and Teddy Ivavanagh
(now 7 M.L.C.) went along to represent the
Trades and Labor Council, while Jimmy
Ryan (“Narranglii Boori” of sundry Bul-
letin verses) spoke up for the mummers.
Marlowe was the management. About two
minutes after the pourparlers began Ryan
got into verbal holts with Marlowe, and the
conference resolved itself into an exchange
of picturesque irrelevancies and vain efforts
to prise the combatants apart. The Actors’
Union vanished shortly afterwards. But it
had a notable resurrection, and is now part
of a very formidable alliance.
“Kana”: The ragging of musical master-
pieces is a nefarious business. Some ruffian
started it by converting Grieg’s “Peer Gynt”
suite into the “Peer da Gink” jazz. Then
Rachmaninoff’s “Prelude” was transformed
into a fox-trot, and sacrilegious hands were
laid on Beethoven’s “Pastoral Symphony’
and Chopin’s “Funeral March.” Now Saint
Saens’s “Softly Awakes My Heart,” the
aria from “Samson and Delilah,” is tickling
the toes of the whites who have gone crazy
about nigger dances. Perhaps Puccini s
action for breach of copyright and “moral
and artistic damages” will save living com-
posers from the degenerate parodist, but
there is no one to protect the dead.
TWO-GUN JED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘New York, Jan. 4.—A nation-wide movement
to withdraw all films showing Miss Normand and
Miss Purvianee is gaining headway. Two States
already have taken action in this direction, namelv,
Kansas and Tennessee.” — Cable.
My name is Jedediah Blugg;
I come from Tennessee,
The place where we’re a blamed sight freer
Than them down-easters be.
My name is Jedediah Blugg—
I’m “Two-gun Blugg.” Get me?
If any gopher gits my goat
I pity that galoot.
He won’t have time to toss a dime
Before I starts to shoot
An’ count his toes with pistol-balls
That perforate his boot.
I’m “Two-gun Jedediah Blugg,
The chaiupeen of the Free.”
Them silly ducks they call Ku Ivlux
Ain’t half as hot as me;
And I’m the censor of the films
’Way down in Tennessee.
We ain’t partic’lar if, down home,
A nigger cheeks a white;
The boys will play “Auto da F 6”
And light him up at night.
But ain’t we Prohibition, just!
The guy that drinks must fight.
The coon who don’t put up his hands
The moment that we draw
Will surely smell the 'smoke of Hell
With lead pills in his craw.
We don’t allow no answers back
From any Johnnie Raw r .
We’re vurry lib’ral minded, too,
Regardin’ cards an’ dice,
An’ when we lose we often use
A gun to give them spice.
When skinnin’ boobs you can’t expect
Smart kids to be too nice.
But when the Pickshers film a gal
That’s been upon the spree,
We grab our hats an’ reckon that’s
No good ter Tennessee!
We mustn’t hare our moral sense
Corrupted—No, Sir-ree.

Old Subscriber: Don't think it was even
much of :i coincidence. One contributor has writtei
on that subject off and on for years. This mai
made his observations in Adelaide. ... 164: Thanks:
but it wants winnowing. .. .W.H.W.: But news-print
isn't, back, to its pre-war price, and probably never
will be until some other paper-making’ material is
discovered, it is still just about double the old price
—rather more than less.... Dee Gee: Much obliged.
But Leason explains that lie has lately been working
a stripper in U.S.A., where, of course, they have
the right-hand drive.... Collusion: Disagree violently
with you on some points; and the others have already
been very fully discussed. .. . A.BAY.: Very flabby
O’Ken: You write as though there was some “d —d
merit” about these titles... .A.J.H.: “My Malice
Queen” hasn’t a sweet enough voice. .. .J.R.P.: V

but when it is only a preface to ihe night we can't
get interested in. it... .Stan F.: Very rugged stuff....
C.R.S.: Nicely done, but not quite strong enough....

J.H.B. : Only says the things usually said in verse
that limps .... J.11.C.5.: Misses, but you are on the
way K.S.M.: Not hopeless, but not yet accept-
able.... Mombak : The. terrible adder incident lias a
pathos all its own:-
The deadly serpent slithered
Towards the drunkard well blithered,
He let a piercing yell,
And on the pavement fell
lii a foaming fit.
Upraised the filthy reptile,
Who that awful noise did rile.
It bit and bit again
Till tiie drunkard who insane
On the road did sit.
He saw the filthy adder
And the sight made him madder,
And he grabbed a hefty stone
Which was lustily thrown
At the snake, now in flight.
They found him next morning
As the bright new day was dawning,
Cold and stiff and stark
With many a tell-tale mark
Of his awful fight.
. ...N.A.R: This is a poor market for that line of
goods C.G.W.: Both miss. Bertram B.: But the
Americans are not like that. They’re really the most
sentimental people in the world F.J.IL : No use

write the things he has already written. Seems
rather a waste of rhymes M.8.G.: What’s tin
good of stringing all those commonplaces together?
First, get something to say J.8.A.: Not enough
there. .. .R.C.H.: Very crude.... W. E. (Colac) : The
verse creaks at the joints, and even then only tries
to repeat old things Frank: If that’s news to your
pal he must be hard up for something to think about.
. ...R.S. (Sans Souei) : Too long for its interest....
Rickberry: Sad sort of mirth. .. .8.C.F.: Your sing-
ing may do all those things, but it doesn’t affect us
much... .Aldington: Your verse has got stiff joints.
. ...M.H. (Woollahra) : The rhymes seem as if they
were pumped up from a great depth E.F.W.:
Says very little and goes all out of tune at the
finish.... J.J.S.: Rubbish.... N.L.lt.: It almost made
us weep.... Nootheems: Bring them in, then :
May bards forever songs proclaim
Of woman, war and wine,
And mount the pinnacles of fame
Like brainy boys to shine;
Oh, let them sing of marriage bells
Of wattle blooms and verdant dells.
Of pictures, parrots, wooden shoes,
Even politics I’ll excuse ;
But it seems to me the only things
That have tempted not their muse,
Are squawky, porky hogs,
And the dear little frogs.
... .E.0.M.: They flutter feebly without having any-
thing to say.... A.H.W.: The verse doesn’t carry it.
....Amapu: You don’t g’et any of the spirit of the
thing... .R.A.S.: “The Misers” keep saying one little
thing- over and over, and it is not worth the repeti-
tion.. ..King K.: They want better thinking and
more skill... . A.P.C.: Poor imitations of a poor kind
of verse.. . .A.B. (Perth) : Hopeless, and without a
hint of 5ki11.... Hope P.: Can’t reply by letter. The
verse is not bad, but gets to very little... .J.M.
(Hawthorn): You have an idea; now see if you
can’t make more of it. ...H.W.: We can’t -work up
any feeling for the bird that stands on one claw or
for anything else that causes an outpouring of such
feeble verse. .. .R.C.H.: You don’t make the best of
your material... .J.C.S.: The very thin yarn is not
improved by the telling... .L.P.S.: May be true:
but it is the sort of story that could be manufactured
by the gross... .Arc Light: Milk-and-water—-and
so much water that even the office cat disdained it.
.... D.1.A.8.: Very near; and the same good work-
in a straightforward story would have carried
through easily. . . .Verger: All mush... .E.L.M.:
Glad to consider anything you may submit. There
is but one black list in this office, and the only
names in it belong to people who have tried to
sell us stolen stuff as their own.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.E.: No hint of the real thing; almost anybody-
can turn out those eccentricities... .J.R.W.: Graded
f.a.q. ; send a. sample or two of next season’s crop
G.C.: The shortage of Indian ink doesn’t excuse
you; but we won’t be rude to a lady... .X.Y.X.
and A.A.: Hopelessly crude... .H.C.: You’re on the
right track, though a long way from the pay-office.
. ...R.L.W.: Let it be also your last until you have
learned drawing... .J.B. (Auckland): Some promise;
but don’t scratch.... M.M.: Tragic drawing of a
comic-opera poet pestered by flies and a squint-eyed
old-maid has been entered for Leap Year’s worst-art
competition... .Tarquin: Among the also-damneds.
S. and N.: Good job the S.P.C.A. didn’t catch
you doing things like that to dumb animals.
“Sturt”: The S.A. Government has plans
for a new railway crossing of the river at
Murray Bridge. The new structure will be
about 100 yards down-stream from the one
which at present carries the Adelaide-Mel-
bourne express: this old one has lately shown
signs of sinking a bit, and will go back to
its original purpose of a mere road. The
new one will have a centre span of 240 ft.,
outer ones of 145 ft., and numerous 70ft. gir-
ders to cover the swampy approaches. It
is to be single track, made entirely of steel,
and to cost a quarter of a million (esti-
mated ).

Are you sometimes discouraged and think
you’ll never get any better?
Can you tell what is the matter with you,
or what makes you sick?
Do you know that about nine-tenths of all
sickness is caused by Kidney Trouble?
Have you ever stopped to , think that your
kidneys may be the cause of your poor health?
Most people do not realise how much work
the kidneys are required to do every day.
Every drop of blood in the body must pass
through and be filtered by the kidneys thousands
of times a day.
How can they do their work well if they are
sick?
If your kidneys need treatment, DR.
SHELDON’S GIN PILLS, the Wonderful Kidney
Remedy, will prove to be just the medicine
you need.
Gin Pills Will

Help You.
It is no longer necessary for anyone to suffer
with Backache, Kidney, Bladder or Urinary
troubles, or to contend with Rheumatism or Stiff
Joints, for Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills quickly remove
all such troubles.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills are the most wonder-
ful Remedy yet devised for ridding the system of
uric acid and driving out all the poisonous
impurities. They are entirely different from all
other Remedies and act on the principle of
cleansing out the poisons and remedying the
cause. No matter how long you have suffered,
how old you are, or what you have used, the
principle of Gin Pills is such that it is practically
impossible to take them into the human system
without results. They start to work the minute
you take them, and they help you from the first
time that you use them.

u O.K. ’: Glaring at me from a foreign
postage-stamp is a reminder of what was one
of the bedrock causes of Germarfy’s “wOrld-
conquest” war. Jealousy of the English lan-
guage, its absolute supremacy in the world,
is ingrained in German character and policy.
Every patriotic Hun of imagination resented
the fact that a knowledge of English was an
absolute necessity to German men of com-
merce, whereas the “damned Britishers”
could get along very well without a know-
ledge of German. The foreign postage-stamp
that provokes _ this paragraph is on a letter
from Shanghai, and it bears two inscriptions
—one in Chinese, for the information of the
native population, that it is “Republic of
China postage,” and the other in English,
for the benefit of the Western world. Aus-
tralians take this as a matter of course; to
the German it was an odious reminder of
inferiority.

“S.C.C.”: “Rotide” (B. 20/12/’23) is
unfair in his diatribe at the Australian Ad.
Man. In the first place the 1923 Conven-
tion of Ad. Men did not express the com-
mendable intention of inducing people to
buy only Aussie goods. How could it when
some of its leading lights handle in the main
advertising accounts for imported lines?
“Rotide” seems tohave confused theconvention
with the Ad. Men’s recently formed Common-
wealth Propaganda Dept., which aims at get-
ting Australia advertised properly and effici-
ently. The slur about the stealing of copy and
illustrations from Yankee magazines is un-
warranted. Australian advertising is de-
veloping individuality very rapidly. Although
here and there is found a plagiarist, 90 per
cent, of Australia’s worth-while publicity
is the product „of Australian brains and
training. And naturally; for the great
majority of our ad. men are good Austra-
lians doing their best to develop an Austra-
lian style of advertising.
* * * *
“Country Ped”: “Twenty-five years ago
that crick was full of blackfish; nice clear
water, always running—an’ now look at it!”
said an old resident of the Mt. Pleasant
(Vic.) district. I looked. The once good
creek is a chain of small, black, muddy
waterholes far apart. Last winter it was
dry altogether. Only for two days in Aug-
ust was it in high Hood. About 35 years
ago its banks were lined with fine red-gum
trees; the mount where it has its source was
clothed with a thick box forest, and the
valley through which it flows was similarly
well timbered. To-day all that timber has
gone—cut, burned, sold for firewood—and
eyen the red-gums on the banks have been
rung. Little wonder that the blackfish no
longer live in the creek, that the Shire Coun-
cil has had to construct big dams to store
water for drought periods, and that through
the cleared paddocks sloping to the creek are
cut great gutters, spoiling acres of culti-
vated land! The pioneers have a lot to be
thanked for, but not for this senseless de-
struction. But their descendants are just
as bad, for what water does come down the
creek they allow to go to waste, and they
make no attempt to prevent the erosion of
cultivable, land. If they would only plant
trees along the creek and its destructive little
tributaries the district would regain some
of its former attractions, waste land would
be reclaimed, and the timber would be gain-
ing in value every year. Mt. Pleasant is not
the only district in Australia that needs a
forest conscience, either.
WHEN THE CRAYS ARE IN THE POT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, the cray is sly and crafty, and there’s labor all
in vain
In rough baskets made by bushmen out of osiers
(my grief!);
For he goeth in with pleasure, but he cometh out
again
To enjoy a grateful supper in his haven on the
reef.
Yea, the cray is most elusive, an enigma of the
sea;
But some wise men out of Eden never fail to
find the spot,
For he can’t resist temptation, or a leg of wallaby.
If displayed and neatly garnished in a well-con-
structed pot.
There is joy and jubilation when the little boatn
return
From the rocks and reefs through breakers, as
the winds are blowing free,
With their precious living cargo of the cray for
which men yearn,
And I’d raise a rousing chantey to these fishers of
the sea.
There are ballads made to buccaneers and pirates
who were hung,
There are chanteys of bold sailors and of sea-
fights, quite a lot;
But (yo ho!) the grandest sea-song that has ever
yet been sung
Is the fishers’ intermezzo when the crays are in
the pot.
How a subtle Greek smiles softly, as he sets the
tables right
In his florid Melbourne cafe, and uplifts a hymn
of praise
As a gay and sportive party enters in to make a
night
On rich plates of scarlet crayfish called a “lobster
mayonnaise!”
And the Dago band sounds dreamy, with its harp
and violin,
And the chef glares in the kitchen, and the water’s
boiling hot,
And “seex sheelin’ each,” says Spiro, for this night
of gaudy sin,
As a tribute to Poseidon, when the crays are in
the pot.

How Quantity enhances
Quality in Studebaker Cars
Widespread demand necessitates that
Studebaker motor cars be produced on a
large scale. Quantity production not only
serves to lower prices, and as a result offer
the purchaser the maximum value, but
it actually improves the quality of
Studebaker cars because it provides for a
wide division of labour making every
man employed in Studebaker factories a
specialist at his allotted task.
Contrast such a workman to the one who
must perform a number of duties —be a
jack of many trades and master of none!
Studebaker factories, like Studebaker
workmen,follow a course of specialisation,
the entire production facilities being de-
voted to the manufacture of six-cylinder
cars exclusively. The Studebaker reputa-
tion for dependable and economical trans-
portation extends over a period of 72 years.

Here is a workman adjusting valves in a Studebaker
Light-Six Engine. This man does nothing else all
day long. Being a specialist at this task, he can
obviously perform his work with greater accuracy
and at less cost than the workman who is required
to skip from one operation to another. Large scale
production in Studebaker factories permits such
specialisation of labour with the result of increasing
the value of Studebaker cars and ensuring their high
Quality throughout.

BOTTLED IN THREE SIZES.
“Pet": It was William Knight Treves —
not Sir Frederick—that practised at Mar-
gate, England, and whose wife died there
(B. 27/12/’23). I know, as -my mot-ber--
and Mrs. AY. K. Treves were schoolmates
and lifelong friends, and my dad (also a
med.) and the two Treves medicoes were col-
leagues. The family is of French extraction.
“Alastor": Deputy-Premier Gillies, who-
will take the reins when Theodore departs
on liis loan-chasing mission, is a quiet, un-
assuming person, notably popular on both
sides of the House. He has never been
known to give offence in Parliament; yet
he is an uncompromising Labor man. Should
Theodore go south after Federal honors it’s
a sure tip that Gillies will be given the
leadership of the party in Bananaland.
T. A. Ryan, the veteran auctioneer of
Brisbane, who went out with the old year,
aged 76, proudly claimed that he was
founder of Anzac Day. He made the sug-
gestion to Col. Tliynne, and the idea re-
ceived official approval from Senator Pearce,
then Minister for Defence, who congratu-
lated Ryan on the conception of “a memor-
able movement so intimately connected with
national sentiment.”
It may be that there is a hole somewhere in
the yarn about labor being “the sole source of
wealth." If it is, then for its years the S. M.
Herald should be no richer than the Sydney
Daily Mail, which is the same as' saying
that the Mail should be quite as affluent as
the Herald, seeing that the staff has always
labored just as strenuously—much more
strenuously, perhaps.
Commodore Sir Frederick Young, who be-
came chief of the Admiralty Salvage Section
when it was formed to lift the wrecks which
ihe Germans were making, is in these parts.
The war-job fell to him naturally: it is 38
years since he became head surveyor of the
Liverpool Salvage Association, and ever since
he has been robbing Neptune in the interests
of underwriters and his firm. He is re-
visiting M.L. after an absence of 30 years,
and is holidaying; though the shores of the
Rickety Islands have a wreck or two which
may interest him. ...
“Nitric": Re “Gylandah’s” one-armed
handy-man (B. 20/12/’23). There’s a wood-
carter and storeman at Redcliffe (Q.) who
has his right arm off at the shoulder; but
he is a first-class axeman, and has been
known to win wood-chopping champs. Work-
ing with a forest-devil clearing timber, he
is as good as the best, and feels no handi-
cap. He is also a good rifle-shot. “Gylan-
dah” mentions sport. Well, what about St.
John, the Queensland tennis-player, who has
his right hand off at the wrist and yet has
been inter-State rep. in three sports—tennis,
football and cricket? He uses the stump of
his right arm to extraordinary advantage.
“T. 0.1.”: John Thompson Ralston, wdio
has died in Sydney at 60, had been admitted
to practice as a solicitor 35 years ago. He
was a grandson of John Thompson, Deputy-
Surveyor-General in Thomas Mitchell’s time ;
his father was one of the earliest managers
of the A.M.P. Society, a brother is Acting-
Justice Ralston, and an uncle was that John
Malbon Thompson who was in Mcllwraith’s
first Ministry in Queensland. The original
John Thompson built the second house in
Woolloomooloo—it was known for years as
Alanthus College.
“Lexite” among the martyrs:—
A piece spoken by Sinclair, M.L.0., about the
calamities that would follow the abolition of N.S.W.
Uppah House, made many an old Laborite grin.
Sinclair was in one of the early batches of Labor
M’s.L.C., and was appointed in the hope that lie
would vote for the destruction of the chamber he
now applauds. So were other martyrs of those
days, notably Ernie Farrar, now a, Nationalist Minis-
ter and a prospective Empire .Exhibitioner. Farrar
used to be a fervent denouncer of the Second Cham-
ber. And there was Frank Bryant, who became
locally famous for his tirades against “the fossils.”
But Frank changed early. When congratulated by
the Labor Council on his elevation to the martyr’s
job, his pride surged to his lips as he spoke of
“that august ’Ous e of which I have the honner to
be a member.”
The steamer Clan MacTavish, which re-
cently arrived at Port Adelaide, has in her
saloon a bell inscribed. “The manly fight
shown by the Clan MacTavish fills us in the
Grand Fleet with admiration. We sym-
pathise with those who lost relatives as a
result of the action. J. R. Jellicoe, Com-
mander-in-Chief.” This bell commemorates
the fight between the original Clan Mac-
Tavish and the German raider Moewe near
the Canary Islands on January 17, 1916.
Captain Wilson, the Clan’s skipper, put up
a brave fight against overwhelming odds
until his vessel was sunk. Twenty-five of
the crew were killed, and the survivors were
taken to Wilhelmshafen, where they were in-
terned until the Armistice. Wilson, who was
awarded the D. 5.0., is now in charge of the
Clan MacTavish 11.
“Sobretodo” on Australia’s foreign trade:
Randolph Bedford’s “My Electorate” (B. 27/12/’23)
contains matter of interest, but puts forward wildly
impossible proposals in connection with Austral-
American trade. It is quite true that certain British
meat interests are interested in the Argentine. But
U.S.A. packers are also much in evidence in South
America; and it is no use trying to blink the fact
that it is the high grade and prime quality of Argen-
tine beef which is winning for it its success in com-
petition with Australian meat in England. The
U.S.A. is certainly a great and rich market, but the
wideawake Vank takes every precaution, through
tariffs, customs regulations, etc., to prevent the
greatness and riches thereof being tapped by other
countries, and' no- indications "are manifest of any
desire or intention on his part of changing or modi-
fying this policy in the slightest. As to the open-
ing of 500 or so shops in the principal American
cities for the sale of Australian goods, to be run
by a Commonwealth Commissioner, the idea is
delirious. Firstly, I venture to assert that Uncle’s
law forbids the establishment of foreign Govern-
ment undertakings on American territory. Secondly
were there no legal obstacles, how does Mr. Bedford
propose to overcome the opposition of the gigantic
food trusts? As the Government on the spot is
unable to control the activities of these combine's,
our chances would be nil. Thirdly and finally, a
study of our Government trading operations discloses
a long string of failures, with scarcely a redeeming
feature in the collection. Mr. Bedford’s suggestions
are mere herrings drawn across the path of true
reform. The thing we’ve got to aim at is the im-
provement of our products. We have done it so
far as wool is concerned ; now we must do the same
thing with our meat —our beef particularly.

The School Boy says:
“Hunger's awful — can’t study
— can’t pay attention. Feel
like clearing out and leaving
everything. But you bet I
know how to treat Hunger!”
The schoolboy’s way is by the appetis-
ing nourishing sandwiches of REX HAM
PATE which await him at 11 a.m.
He likes the taste of them—you will,
too. They satisfy his ravenous appetite
because Rex Ham Pate makes his sand-
wiches most acceptable.
Rex Ham Pate is the sandwich spread
without a peer. It is all Rex Ham—with
the mildness and flavor retained. The
spicy piquancy appeals to young and old.

“I have used Rexona Soap
on my little girl Joyce since
birth, and will continue to do
so, as I think it is absolutely
the only soap for children.”
Mrs. W. MULLINS,
148 Jersey Road,
Woollahra, N.S.W.
Children’s chief charm lies in their soft,
lovely skin. To keep that purity and
delicacy of skin health, use Rexona Skin
and Facial Soap. Washing with Rexona
Soap first takes away all impurity and dirt,
then softens the skin cells, and acts as a
tonic upon the cuticle so that the elasticity
is strengthened, and the result gives the
soft bloom of health that we see in early
youth. Rexona Soap prevents roughness,
beautifies complexions, soothes tender
skin, protects from infection and diseases.
Nothing so promotes and maintains the
purity of the complexion, hands and hair
under all conditions as does Rexona Soap.
It excels in purity, delicacy and fragrance,
for it is medicated on the same princple as
the famous Rexona Ointment.

TTTE used to-come into our cosy room
1 y And look in every corner, note
with pride
Our clear reflections wavering in tlic floor.
How fragrant were the flowers grouped
inside; . ,
And when the silken tapestry was stirred,
How came a sudden life to beast and bird
In those green forests the designer planned
go many moons ago! llow stood the stag,
His antlers bent against the leaping dogs
Here was the Hunter boastful of the bag,
In high jackboots and elbow-gauntlets sewn
With scarlet stitcliery and virent stone.
And, in a saffron wimple, here the queen
Watched from a tower for the first red spear ;
There the fat priest, with hands across his
paunch,
Pondering the juiciest slices of the deer;
And here the page-boy loitering at his heels.
Thinking much more of women than ot
meals.
Down to the polished boards the weaving
hung; ...
Sometimes we lifted it —forbidden fruit
That brought us nothing but the solid walls
Drifting a pensive dust of orris root.
When white star lilies lit the fields of night
We scarcely needed tapers for a light.
We enter now by the accustomed ways.
The spring protests behind its boss of gold.
The wood creaks in its passing; yet how
smooth
The sliding panel used to run of old !
There are tall vases still where roses bloom
And, beyond these, a presence in tlie room.
Three corners do we gaze in, praise the
flowers,
Talk of the floor. It keeps its lustre well!
We talk of tapestries and wonder if
The stag at last to his pursuers fell;
And if the queen came down the ’broidery
stair
To meet the king and found a pageboy there!
I look into your face. You look away.
Your eyes are restless, though your will com-
mands
Your lips to smile. How still your body is—
x\nd yet you cannot hide those trembling
hands!
I wonder if your like mine, are lies,
Denying horror of those unseen eyes.
We stare about the room, yet always check
Our glance before it reaches one dark place.
If we should lift the pulseless tapestry
What would we find? A drawn and blood-
less face?
Something that crouches, of the light afraid?
An empty coffin on its trestles laid?
Day after day we shall not dare to look.
Only my soul is drowned in tears to know 7
How 7 open w 7 ere all corners of the room
To open things a little year ago!
The tapestries hid only w 7 alls behind.
With nothing there w r e sought yet dared not
find.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MILLY CLEGHORN grew to beauty
as the sunlight grows from the mists
of dawn. It was no sheltered pink-
and-white prettiness: the sun saw to that.
But the features were there and the fine
figure and the good blood; a mouth that
laughed and eyes that were eloquent. Her
life in the open had left its tattoo-marks in
little freckles upon her nose; she was
straight as a young palm, tiptoe for woman-
hood and ripening. Bill of Bringalily, the
friend of her brother Jimmy, ached when he
watched her at her cheerful tasks—all her
lithe young body in play to her extended
arms grasping the broom, or with the most
recent Cleghorn baby in her arms in the cool
of the evening. If Bringalily had been
Joseph, his brethren would have put him
down a well; for he dreamed dreams.
Meantime he dug the catch-crops—early
potatoes designed to harvest the quick big
money of the city that pays for the early
lamb to be garnished with green peas. This
day was one of the two in the week that he
gave to Cleghorn, partly because of his mate-
ship with Jim, partly because by helping Jim
he was helping Milly, serving a lazy Laban
for a finer Rachel, and playing no Jacob
tricks on Cleghorn’s cows. Suddenly he
straightened his back and stood up all of his
six feet-odd of height, and looked at the sun
of the late forenoon making splendid the black
pines, and the ancient granite still living,
and the great granite dice spilled about the
hills. He lifted his head higher and looked
the sun in the eye, and lowered his glance
again to the pink blur that was his own
orchard in bloom, seemingly hacked out of
the black-green pines and the brown-green
eucalypts and the majestic confusion of the
great rocks. He turned west and saw the
white smoke rising straight up from Cleg-
horn’s chimney, and remembered that he had
helped to build it; and the verandah covered
in a purple riot of the morning glory whose
vines he and Milly had tended for their deli-
cate month while the roots were finding the
way to safety in the rubble. All that trim
house and the healthy catch-crops and the
long avenues of pears and peaches in bloom,
and the two acres of budding vines and the
flower garden in the granite sand, gay with
hollyhock and mignonette, pansy and stock
and rose, represented effort with love behind
it; stood for the hunger of the new genera-
tion for the beauty of life, and its battle
with the laziness and selfishness of the old.
And then he bent again to the work, driving
the potato-fork at a wide angle to the crop
below; for he saw, framed in the isle of
bloom, Milly bringing him morning tea. As
she pretended that her object was not
i iringalily Bill but merely tea, so Bringalily
Bill pretended that he couldn’t see her yet.
She stopped by him and they began the for-
mula :
“Bringalily!”
“Yes, Mil! Hullo !”
“I brought you a cup of tea.”
“Well, that’s kind. I was just thinkin'
what I’d like, an’ I couldn’t think what it
was. And it was just a cup of tea.”
He stood while he drank, and then looked
at the girl with the bloom of the new orchard
round her ; the trees loaded with blossom, but
not yet so tall as she. The three years since
fire had swept over the orchard had given
her height, slenderness and beauty, as it
had given the peaches girth and spread of
bearing branches; they had lifted Bringalily
out of the clumsy stage of youth, and now
he was real man, broad in the shoulder, thin
in the flank and tapering to the feet—the
human wedge. His mental clumsiness had not
departed, though—at least, in her presence.
Among men he laughed and had his say-—a
long say, too. But she made him tremble,
and in his painful self-consciousness he
took refuge in the formula: “Spuds lookin’
well, Mil!”
“They’re the best in the mountain. Jim
says we ought to top the market.”
“If there’s any market after the commis-
sion agent’s got his bit.”
“They do take us down, don’t they?”
Bringalily heard the tone he had been
waiting for—the tone of deference to the
male, highly proper in the female, and rarely
assumed if the lady be not anxious to please.
The tone loosened his tongue.
“Worse than bushrangers. Of course they
say they only get commission, but it must
be a hundred an’ two per cent. Two blokes
over at Tully’s Gap sent fifty cases of
t’maters to Brisb'ne, an’ they got a cheque for
fourpence a case nett, an’ t’maters were six
bob a case that week. But it’ll be different
with these new spuds. The market will be
short and they can’t steal all the price.”
“Got your own away yet?”
“Only a few bags. I found it’d be a good
market, so I came over early this mornin' to
get some of yours away with mine.”
“You’re a good chap. Bringalily. I don’t
know what we’d have done without you—you
and .Timmy.”
“Where’s the old bloke?”
“Father? Oh, he’s somewhere about,
talkin’ with Uncle.”
“Uncle! Has that old waster come back?”
“On’y for two days. There’s no bellring-
ing in the township till Saturday.”
In the discussion of Uncle, Bringalil.v’s
self-consciousness vanished utterly, and he
grinned as he talked.
“The bell-ringin’ artist cornin’ out for a
Spring call! He’s the limit, is that Pommy
uncle.”
“D’ye think he’s lazier than father?”
“Yes —no —I couldn’t say. It’d take a good
judge to separate them at the winnin’ post.
I don’t want to say nothin’ nasty about your
old man. Mil, for your sake”
“That’s all right. You couldn’t be like
that, Bringalily. There’s your own farm
and you’ve been here three days this week.”
“Never mind that. Mil,” said Bringalily.
horribly embarrassed by her praise. “It
isn’t me, it’s the country. How can we
stand our clean land gettin’ dirtied by these
old fellers used to dirty streets in the old
country? An’ the cheek o’ them! While
we work they flute about bein’ pioneers!
Pioneers! Spare me days, they couldn't
pioneer through a bloomange without explo-
sives. But we’re different. It’s the sun-
light and the big land about us. Look at
you. Mil. Your mother’s a good woman, an’
hardworkin’ ”
“She was born in Tasmania.”
“An’ she was the only man in your family
till Jimmy grew up. But you’re ahead of
her. just as she’s ahead of your old man.”
“Don’t say that, Bringalily.”
“Yes. I will.” replied Bringalily, suddenly
bold. “I Listen ! Behind the log !”
A great fallen tree-trunk blackened by the
fires that had been unable to consume it
broke the lines of the orchard two avenues
away. The sudden voices betrayed the
fact that those indomitable pioneers, Cleg-
horn and Mrs. Cleghorn’s uncle, had been
sunning themselves in the bracken be von d the
tree, and in the heat of debate they had
become audible.
“I’ll betcher,” said the voice of Uncle.
“What’ll y’ bet?”
“I’ll betcher all the rice in China.”
“I’ll bet y’ all the wheat in Noo South
Wales.”
“That’s them!” said Bringalily. “Mailin’
speewaa bets. My station against your sta-
tion ; and then Uncle wagers Mount Morgan
against Broken Hill.”
They laughed loudly and heartily—the
laughter of healthy youth at superstition and
ancient fraud. And then they were sorry
because the laughter brought ancient fraud
to its four feet, and the fierce white whiskers
of Uncle and the long, protesting face of
Cleghorn appeared above the log. The man
and the girl saw not only the two impostors,
but the travelling store of Denny Deneen,
from Quart Pot, stop before the gate, and the
children running from the house to meet it.
as Denny jumped from the cart and entered
the orchard through the top and middle
wires.
“Whatcher mean, laughin’ at me?” de-
manded Uncle,. with his bellman’s dignity
well established.
“It’s disrespec’ful, Mil.” said Cleghorn,
carefully confining his indignation to his
own flesh and blood that could not revolt.
“Laughed at by a farm laborer!” continued
Uncle.
“He’s no farm laborer.” said Milly, all
protective; “he’s a friend.”
“Won’t have no friends larfin’ at me”
said Cleghorn. “They, ain’t friends, any-
ways.”
“An’ who would be friends of yours.
Answer me that,” said Denny Deneen,
behind them; and. without waiting for
the answer.' he continued as he joined the
group: “What’s the matter wit’ you, anny-
way ?”
“Me an’ Uncle was talkin’ about pioneer-
ing, and he offered to bet me”
“Pioneerin’ you were talkin’ about, were
you? Pioneerin’! An’ there’s- these two
terrible devils of pioneers, an’ they're so hard

instant use, save untold pain and worry.
When the little one runs in from his play with a
wry face and smarting, dirt-filled scrape on his knee,
simply wash the part and smear with Zam-Buk.
When father cuts or scrapes his hand, the handy box
of Zam-Buk again meets the emergency, and the
housewife or mother continually finds it a real
friend in need for the burns she receives while cook-
ing, fhe scalds of a washing-day, or the knocks and
bruises of housework.
# Children like Zam-Buk because it is cooling, soothing and pleasant.
Their elders value it still more highly because it is also antiseptic, prevent-
ing poisoning, festering, and because it is good for the tenderest skin.
Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk a daily need, therefore ‘Keep Zam-Buk
handy ’ is a sound home motto.
Girl’s Blood Poison and Boy’s Sores Healed .
Says Nurse S. Francis, of 109
Harris Street, Pyrmont, Sydney:
My little girl, Sheila, started
with blood-poison. She had a
fearful hand——in the doctors
opinion the only way to prevent
worse developments was to ampu-
tate the finger. This I would not
consent to, but decided to treat
the child myself. Zam-Buk was
magical in reducing swelling and
extracting bad matter. 1 simply
continued with Zam-Buk until the
obstinate sore was completely
healed.
“Another experience with Zam-
Buk was when my son, Stephen,
as a consequence of injuries,
developed ulcers on his neck.
Zam-Buk again proved of splen-
did service. Another time when
my son had his foot smashed
open by a cart-wheel, Zam-Buk
helped him through.”

r ™ ga J looking at the feet of Uncle
and Cleghorn, saw the fact, laughed again,
and said “Too true.”
Y°o true?” said Uncle. “Don’t y’ insult
' Vl th yer ‘too true’. We was talkin’

ses a man ’e knows at Cir’clar ’Ead died of

holp you ! So that’s what your great labor
an ? thnles an’ thribulations is about, is it?
An, then an’ honest farrmer of the land dig-
gin taties for loafers, wit’out wages, he

would, tall oft then, because you haven’t the
strent to lace ’em up. How long have ye
been workm’ here this blessed week for
Noomoanya,’ Bringalily?”
“Nothin’ much,” replied Bringalily, not
liking this personal turn of the debate.
And then he found another protector—
Hes worked here three days this week,”
said Milly. “Neglecting his own place, too!”
Not three days,” corrected Cleghorn,
magisterially ready to correct the world.
.Not three days—on’y one day nineteen
hours ackshal workm’ time.”
Not f ree days; on’y one day nineteen
hours, mimicked Denny Deneen. “God help
you, me poor blashted pioneer wit’ the down-
heel boots. Was he to work in the night-
time whin you’re shlapin’, as in the day-
time, too, was he?”
“ ’Tain’t my place he’s workin’ on,” said
L “Why was he larfin’ at me?”
Back to your bell!” said Denny. “Back

fhPruik, I’ll have you shacked. You loafer!
A is honor for you to be laughed at be a
nne man that loves his work like Bringalily.”
Doves his work!” repeated Uncle, stung
to the heart. “ ’Tain’t work he’s after —’tis
Milly there.”
“Wot!” exclaimed the virtuous Cleghorn,
as one devoted to saving his lamb from the
wolf. “Wot! After me dorter?”
‘ Oh!” said Milly, shamed by the publicity
°f ( th e fact she had known a long while.
You dhirrty loafer!” said Denny, seizing
Uncle, by the collar. “You’d bring a young
into it,, lookin’ like the Rose of Darlin’
Downs she is. Whin Bringalily bought new
ttannen uv me for the new baby, didn’t I
see it round your neck for a comf’ter, an’
your little white-lace whiskers shtickin’ out
? uv Out wit' you—back to your
bell!”
He threw Uncle out of the group, and
simultaneously out of the argument.
If he’s after me dorter,” said Cleghorn,
stubbornly, “I don’t want him here no more,
anyways.”
“No,, ’ceptin’ whin there’s threes to fall an’
ploughin’ to do, an’ new shpuds to be digged
tor the dam’ commission agent you left
Denny Deneen for, because ye thought the
bigger the agent the more money ye’d get.”
I don’t want ’im ’ere.”
That’s good enough for me,” said Bringa-
lily, reaching for his coat. “I won’t stay
anywhere I’m not wanted.”
He had put the right arm into its sleeve,
and then Milly entered into possession by
holding the other sleeve.
“I want you, Bringalily ; and if anybody
tells you to go they tell me to go, too.”
At that Denny delicately drew the unwill-
ing Cleghorn away until there were friendly
trees between the lovers and authority.
Denny further bore patiently the pain of
listening to the story of Cleghorn’s troubles
—a story designed to prove Cleghorn’s good-
ness and the world’s malevolence, but failing
signally in its object.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Way of the Barbarian.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
kingdom of Conor Og was nine
miles long and six miles wide at the
widest part between the rivers. Where
the rivers met it was no thickness at all;
and at the back were the high hills with only
feeding for goats and sheep. Those hills
were between Conor Og and the MacErclane
country where there were two kings, or, may-
be, three; but the hills belonged to no king,
only the kings of the men with the sheep;
so that the kingdom of each sort followed
the man that belonged to it just as far as
he went with the sheep. But there was more
grass than the sheep could eat, and so no
fighting about it, though one kingdom and
another were crossed backwards and for-
wards and mixed like two pieces of loose
string.
But it was in the nine miles from the hills
to the joining of the rivers that Conor Og
had the word to say what should be done;
and he said it well, but not many times in
one year. And this was what the kingdom
of Conor Og looked like. At the small end
of it there were five houses set with their
backs to the rivers, and every house had a
boat and a net or two for salmon. In front
of the houses there were fruit-trees and bits
of gardens and then a road that went be-
tween fields and elm-trees to the first town.
There were nineteen houses in the first town
and the makers of all things were there.
There was the goldsmith and the coppersmith
and the ironsmith and five workers in wood
and a writer, besides some that worked in
the fields. And the sellers of all things were
there: those that made garments out of the
cloth the weavers wove, and those that brought
things from far countries up from the sea in
packs. They were all there together, very
friendly and working near the road all the day.
On a little hill at the north there was the
house of the olaves, the makers of songs;
and young men came there from all the
country and all the kingdoms to learn all
the rules of the making, and to read and
write, and other things besides. It was a
fine house with ten doors and a garden about
it, where all the things in world grew;
and the front of it was painted in a hundred
colors, with scroll-work running this way and
that, with a meaning in the turns and twists
that only the wise men knew. The doors
were always open; and if a singing man
came walking across the world or riding on a
horse he could go there and be welcome. And
the people m all the kingdom were welcome
to come and hear the singing or the olaves
speaking their songs; so there was much
knowledge every way in the country through

left green for a year or two of rest between
the crops the cattle were there, small cattle,
but good, with plenty of milk for butter and
cream. Along from the first town to the
second town there were woods full to the
top of every hill with nut bushes and flowers
and bees. In some places there were small
houses and a field or two, with hives for the
bees; and some rabbits and hares ran here
and there that a man could shoot with an
arrow or hit with a stone from a sling.
Beyond the woods was the second town at
the front of a long piece of land that was
good and bad in places, but with a wide bog
away to the north where all the turf came
from to keep the houses warm in the
winter. The second town was like the
the first, but larger. There were seventy-five
houses there and more workers in metal and
in wood; and there was a square in the
middle of the town for a market and a fair,
Once in every three months the fair was
held; and people came in with horses and
asses from the four corners of the world, and
all that the world held to sell and to tell
and to laugh over. It was a good fair ; there
was no other that brought more people either
in the north or in the south. Four roads
went out of the town, and one of them divided
into three a mile from the last house; so
there were six roads altogether, and trees
along the roads, not regularly, but six here
and two there and three in another place,
Every little way there was a house, or two
houses near together, looking over a bit of
garden or a field; and not very far from
the town there were five great houses in
difforent places. They were very grand
houses with trees and gardens about them,
but with each its own kind of look; for
the men that had them were rich, with farm
servants to work for them in the fields and
gold to drink out of when they sat
at the table. The whole country round
them -was yellow with corn in summer,
and the cows were fat in the green
pastures ; and there was a smell of
plenty in that part of the world. But
the two middle roads went on into a place
of small stony hills covered with trees that
were not very high; and on one hill was the
rath of the king. There was a wall of earth
great and high, and some stakes and posts
on the top, and inside Was the king's house
and the hall of meeting and the greeanawn.
\ ery fine they w'ere and painted many
colors, but small, and built at some time
that only the men of knowledge would know'
from their books,
Below the rath were five houses of a little
town where were workers in metal and
wood, but none that sold anything; for
the king provided for these people, and thev
were the King’s men. Conor Og lived in the
ra th with his wife and two young sons, and
four strong men went with him wherever he
walked ; but he was a plain man, and not
cven by ],j s c i oak W ould von know that it
was the king. When he sat at the table in
the i ul H a writing-man was next to him
au( j below the writing-man the men who
worked in metal and wood ; and each man’s
shield hung over the table * that he
jnigijt know his place. Conor Og was
r z
a” "T
bim * A"w idow woman with one
f 9°. me to bun and aak or Judgment
against a rich neighbor; and it was as Conor
°S said that the matter went. When there
as division of land to plough it was Conor
Og who cast the lots; it was the king who
said Peace and the king who said war. Every
floor m the kingdom was open to the king;
and every man must answ T er to him for all
he said and did. So there was not a deed
of wrong done twice in any one year, nor
a deed of blood in 10 years ; for the king
was behind all and near all. Every day he
went out somewhere in his kingdom, and
there was no man or woman or little child
who did not know him to look upon and to
greet. Yet he let the people mostly go their
own way; for it was not a king’s work to
be either spying upon them or giving them
too much advice. Once in the year he met
all the people and talked with them about
the last year and the next year and the
years to come; and what seemed wisest to
them all after talking with the king was the
thing he made law. The men of knowledge
helped him in this ; and afterwards there were
feasting and music and games. There was
enough in the kingdom for all that were
there; and the king’s share was not a heavy
burden.
* * * *
But all this was more than two thousand
years ago; and the country was not civilised.
There were no railway trains and no daily
newspapers, no telegrams or postage stamps,
no elections except of the king only, no gaols,
policemen, department stores, taxation de-
partments, advertisement hoardings or elec-
trie lights. Above all there was no hat of
gold studded with precious stones for the
king to wear. So the people were to be
greatly pitied; for they had never- seen a
city, nor hung to a strap in a tram, nor read
an American novel. They ate and drank
fine things and wore good clothing and loved
fine poetry and music and none tasted want;
but this only show's how savage they were,
for they had no better weapons to kill each
other with than sharp swords and strong
bows and arrow's. They did not know the
meaning of democracy and were faithful to
their king; but each man did the thing he
wmnted to do without hurting the. rest. They
had never learned the great lesson that the
way of the world’s advance is to make a
powerful locomotive engine and set it to
pulling an empty wheelbarrow from place
to place.

THE experience of a New South Wales farmer proves
that men are still apt to call applied knowledge—
good luck* In a dry season when the crops of
his neighbours have for the most part been a failure —
yielding one or two bags of wheat per acre—he has
harvested eight bags per acre.
What is the reason of his success i He has the same
kind of soil as his neighbours, he has to contend with
the same climatic conditions, the same limited rainfall—
yet his returns are 300 per cent, more than his
neighbours.
The secret of his success is not
good luck but good farming
With the aid of a CASE Tractor he fallowed his
ground in the late summer and by intensive cultivation
he thoroughly prepared his seed bed. In all the farm
operations—ploughing, fallowing, cultivating, seeding
and harvesting the CASE enabled him to do more
work and better work —to reduce labour costs and
get better results. Efficient equipment intelligently
operated enabled him to make the best of bad weather
conditions.
The Vital Importance
of Summer Fallowing
The experience of skilled agri-
culturalists is yearly proving the
tremendous importance of Sum-
mer fallowing* Not only does
it destroy growing weeds but it
conserves moisture/ensures in-
tensive cultivation and a better
preparation of the seed bed*
With a CASE Tractor the work
of fallowing is both efficient and
economical*

T he CASE Tractoi
ensures better Farming
By deeper ploughing and more
intensive working of the land,
better results are achieved at less
cost. The CASE will supply
all the power needed on the farm
—traction or belt work. It can
be utilised day or night—it never
tires in the hottest weather.
Labour costs are reduced —work
is easier.
CASE Service is always at com-
mand of owners. Spare parts
are always available.
