The RED PAGE
Widdershins — Oliver Onions (Sydney
Book Club). Readers of the old ballads
will know that “widdershins” means “con-
trary to the course of the sun.” The title
suits these short stories on occult themes.
1 hey are very well written.
The Varmint —Owen Johnson (Dy-
mock’s). An amusing story of American
school-boy life. It would be worth while
comparing it with Vachell’s The Hill—
perhaps the best of English school stories
since Talbot Read’s.
Routledge Rides Alone— W. L. Comfort
(Dymoek’s). The adventures of an heroic
war-correspondent in India and at the
Russo-Jap war. The style is mild Ameri-
can, and may be illustrated by these sen-
tences from the chapter-tops: “Certain
myihans sit tight with Kuroki while the
Bloody lower puts forth her Bright little
Buds. .. . Noreen Cardinegh, entering
a Japanese house at eventide, is confronted
by the Visible Thought-form of her Lover."
.... A good time-killer.
a^^! ieSt n t rr n^ Galendar (Angus and Rob-
ertson). G.K.C. appears to advantage in
these scraps of prose and verse from all his
DOORS.
Pnur 6 Story— David Graham
Phillips (Dymock’s). Like all his later
work this is a strong indictment of the get-
rich-quick American man and the heartless
woman - A crazy musician, who
thought he saw himself in one of Phillips’
earlier novels, shot the novelist dead in
l &3t » J ? e , was the of
much-rakers,” and deserved a better fate.
TASTE.
I “Clever, but dubious in taste.” — Olym
piau verdict of a newspaper in the village
of Melbourne, on H. G. Wells' novel, “The
New Machiaveltt.”
Nay, who is this that crieth
Fierce-tongued, while trembling flieth
Sham, white-faced?
Whose is the Voice disdainful
Provoking visions painful?
Has he Taste?
“I mock your System grand, for
Its glories mostly stand for
Theft and Waste.”
So Wells goes shouting boldly,
And Propputty says coldly,
“Shocking Taste!”
Young Folks will find delectable
A Hero more respectable,
British-based !
He makes his Macliiavelli
A man of flesh, not jelly—
Dubious Taste!
A man his maid may capture
With swift and sudden rapture
By the waist:
And she herself may love it,
But fancy talking of it!
Such bad taste!
Toadies and prudes, a-grovel,
Cry, “Why not keep the Novel
Choice and chaste?
Some reticence, restriction!
He’s writing truth in fiction!
D — Bad Taste!!"
VICTORIA.
L.
Laicadio Hearn
The Li/e and Letters of. Lafcadio Hearn,
published a few years ago, revealed Hearn
as a very agreeable letter-writer. A shy
sensitive man, living for the most part
amongst aliens, he put himself more freely
into his letters than into his books, and the
expression of the soul of that fomantic
Ha tin, with his queer American and Oriental
experiences, and his love of the color and
music of words, is well worth having. A
new volume of The Japanese Letters of
Lafcadio Hearn (Constable and Co.) adds
to his reputation, and places him, if not
mth Lamb and Walpole in the first rank,
at an y rate in the second rank of letter
writers.
Most of the new letters were written in
1890-94, from Kumamoto, where Hearn
taught a Japanese school, to Basil Chamber-
lain, Professor at the Imperial University
of Tokyo, and they relate to questions of
philology, folk-lore, the character of the
people, and many matters of literary in-
terest.
In a rather windy introduction Elizabeth
Bisland defends Hearn against the charges
made in Gould’s book. That Hearn lived
with and wanted to marry a young negress
who had been kind to him when “his poverty
was so extreme that he slept for a time in
an abandoned boiler in a vacant lot” is ad-
mitted to be true. He had human weak-
nesses, and he was the decent sort of human
who did not try to dodge his responsibility.
One element of his character which is
emphasised by Miss Bisland is his mystic-
ism. Though almost blind from boyhood,
his perceptions were remarkably acute, but
he was continually searching behind the
appearance, endeavoring to track the spirit
in its course and find the secret of beauty.
He dreamt of evolution as “a prodigious
systole and diastole of the universe,” and
discovered in Herbert Spencer a mysta-
gogue on a large scale. The delicacy of
his nature made him appreciate the power
of the Scandinavian and Russian novelists,
and the strength of the early Kipling.
I feel I still underrate Kipling. He grows
bigger every day to me—looms up colossally
—reaches out like a stupendous shadow,
over half a planet at once. But, oh! the
hardness of the tone, the silent cynicism of
facts, the self-repression, the matter-of-
course way of seeing things, the extraor-
dinary objectivity and incomprehensible
subjectivity cruel as fate! What a most
damnable thing civilisation is—must be, to
create such a writer! *. . . What a
revelation of the ghostliness of matter {...
What an egregious ass I am to waste a
page upon what that mind hurls into half
a line!
Pierre Loti is another who received from
Hearn a critical appreciation.
Cold-blooded he seems, of cotirse, and per-
sonally detestable he very probably is, and
his life hot at all limpid by our standards.
But what matter! Drop the shell of the
man —the outer husk on which the vices are
mere lichen-growths—and within glows the
marvellous, subtle, luminous-winged soul of
the Latin race, of Latin art, of Latin love
of life and youth and all things beautiful.
He said justly of Lewis Carroll that the
success of Alice and the Snark was not be-
cause they were nonsense, but because they
were true in showing the effect of, words
upon the mind. He read every poet he
could get hold of, and continually called
upon Professor Chamberlain to admire his
favorites. Amongst the French he liked
Gautier and Baudelaire, though he feared
that modern Frenchmen “think only with
their nerves, and too much with the pudic
nerve especially.” For this reason he
thought it desirable that Europe should “be-
come Cossack.”
We are growing too nervous and tired
and' enervated in the' West. A general in-
fusion of barbarian blood would greatly
assist and improve literature.
He makes a great many delightfully frank
and irrelevant remarks about his methods
of work, his life, his neighbors; now quot-
ing a poem by some obscure American
which had pleased him, and then a story
he has heard, a pidgin-English essay by one
of his pupils, or a bit of folk-lorel—any-
thing, in fact, which he thought would in-
terest his sympathetic? reader. The little
budget of letters to his Japanese wife help
to a better understanding of a romantic
and likeable character.
The Japanese
Of all foreign interpreters of Japanese
character Lafcadio Hearn still remains un-
rivalled. In the early days of his Japanese
life the very strangeness of the people
charmed him; but it was the vanishing rem-
nant of old Japan that held his adniiration
and inspired his first book— Glimpses of
Unfamiliar Japan. He continued to ex-
ploit that which was a mine of literary
wealth to a romantic and a mystic; though
it is clear from-his Japanese Letters that
disillusionment was in steady progress. He
still believed that on the moral side the old
Japanese civilisation was “as far in ad-
vance of the Western as it was inaterially
behind it.” While Japan remained conser-
vative he thought she would be immensely
strong; the sudden and extensive adoption
of Western methods, he feared, would lead
to dissolution.
Writing in 1893 to Professor Chamber-
lain he said:
Social disorganisation is going to beget
revolution. The spirit of insubordination,
hostility to foreigners, disrespect to tradi-
tions, contempt for religion and national
vanity grows with prodigious rapidity, just
in proportion as the modernisation becomes
more thorough. The educated Japanese
complains at being obliged to conceal his
scepticism about the divinity of the Em-
peror. But when the peasant becomes
equally sceptical, he won’t pay his taxes.
I can’t see anything for Japan now but
revolution or a military domination; the
latter, I think, would be the best. No, the
country is certainly going to lose all its
charm—all its Japanesiness; it is going to
become all industrially vulgar and indus-
trially commonplace.
In another letter he wonders how he could
have written of horrible places as gardens
of paradise, and horrible people as angels
and divinities, and supposes it must have
been the illusion of first love. “What is
there to love except what is passing away?”
Not only did the new Japanese “in frock
coats and loud neckties” offend his artistic
senses; but, drunk with pride, they showed
him Japan with the mask off, and at one
place in this long correspondence he comes
out with an emphatic statement of disgust:
“/ hate and detest the Japanese.. .. I
simply abominate the Japanese.
“There’s a nice confession for the author
of ‘Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan’ to make.
But remember —the book was finished a
long time ago; and the illusion had not
worn off. I should not like now to trust
myself to say what I think of the Japanese
in their relation to us. I fear the mission-
aries are right who declare them without
honor, without gratitude, and without
brains.
“D —n the Japanese !
“Excepting, of course, the women of
Japan who are—well, who are not Japanese.
They remain angels. Sufficient for this day
is the evil thereof.”
*
J. D’Autremer, a Parisian lecturer on
Oriental Languages, has written an account
of The Japanese Empire and its Economic
Conditions (Sydney Book Club), which
gives a mass of information, well arrangec
and explained. He sees the passing oJ
those characteristics which made the Jap-
anese attractive. Artists are disappearing
and manufacturers of shoddy taking their
place. Misery reigns in Japan. The aver-
age wage of a tradesman is Is. a day.
A farm laborer is paid about £3 165., and a
woman about £2 a year, and out of these
wages heavy taxes have to be provided.
Thirty years ago a family could live on
7s. 6d. a week.
Those were good times, but there was no
“glory.” To-day there is glory, but it costs
dear. Life has become so costly that the
family which formerly expended 7s. 6d.
must now expend 255. It follows that there
is frightful poverty to-day in Japan, though
it is true that no one complains of it, and
that up to now it has been borne without
a murmur. Will this continue? Every-
thing is taxed to the uttermost, and the
land yields all it can yield because it is
poor and its capabilities are very limited.
The burden of oppressive taxation has given
a stimulus to Socialist agitation, especially
amongst the workers in town factories
where, according to the Director of the
School of Industry at Tokyo, they are
“treated like a lot of wretched cattle, and
live accordingly.” The prompt execution
of some Socialist leaders recently is not
likely to stamp out a movement which came
over with the other Western innovations
and. has the driving force of dire poverty
behind it. And, according to D’Autremer,
it had already made progress in the Army.
The weakest part of D’Autremer’s book
isj that dealing with national finance—for
toe very good reason that the Japs ~ “who
conceal whatever they can from Europe,
conceal their financial affairs more than
their military secrets.”
* * • »
Some of D’Autremer’s conclusions are
endorsed by J. C. Balet in Military Japan
(Kelly and Walsh, Yokohama). The cen-
tral facts which this author insists upon
are the extraordinary national pride which
has prompted great sacrifices, and the be-
lief in the sacredness of the Mikado, He
questions the endurance of the Jap. soldier—
in the last war he was living on his nerves.
He is doubtful about the bravery of the
Jap. as an individual, except when acting
for the Emperor.
If they can accomplish by a gradual evo-
lution the harmonious fusion of our indi-
vidualistic tendencies with the antique re-
ligion of everything for the sovereign and
by the sovereign, they will then have accom-
plished a wonderful task. But it is inevit-
able that the day must come when these
diametrically opposite tendencies will enter
into conflict under the manifold influences
of the critical spirit, of the love of luxury
an ? comfort—terrible dissolvents of
naive faiths. On that day Samson will lose
his locks and with them his strength.
Balets book gives a detailed account (so
far as the facts were obtainable) of the
army and navy of Nippon. The army, he
thinks, is one of the best of the world, the
navy equal to that of the United States,
though inferior in numbers; and he is cer-
tain that it is against the United States
that Japan is increasing her naval strength
and taxing her citizens to the breaking-
point. °
Wallace Nelson
The name of Wallace Nelson is well known
in Westralia, also in Queensland where
it was attached to a powerful voice whose
echoes are still reverberating in the ranges.
He thinks that it should be more widely
known, to which end the pen is mightier
than the voice. So he publishes a book—
Foster Fraser’s Fallacies and other Austra-
lian Essays (Gordon and Gotch, Is), and
disguises his rhodest desire for fame by as-
serting on the first page that the base pur-
pose of the book is to be sold. It would be
no harm if some filthy lucre went the au-
thor’s way (it is little that goes to authors,
as a rule), for this book is worth buying
and reading. The “F.F.F.” part of it is
only the flogging of an already dead horse;
but the other essays make tne larger part
of the book, and cover a wide range of Aus-
tralian interest—Marcus Clarke, the New
Protection, Journalism in Australia, Henry
Kendall, Australian Poetry, the Sex Ques-
tion, and the Crowd.
You may disagree with Wallace Nelson,
you could find fault with his style, but you
cannot help seeing and hearing Wallace Nel-
son through the pages of his book. He ex-
presses his own opinions and not another’s.
He has a personality. It is that of a hard-
headed, humorous Scot, who, 20 years ago,
came out here a dying man, and has been
dying agreeably ever since. Australia, he
says, is an excellent place to die in, and he
sounds her praises up and down his essays
in the liveliest manner imaginable.
He is whole hearted in his admiration of
Kendall’s poetry, "and no less enthusiastic
about the charm of Arthur Bayldon. Bayl-
don is like Wallace Nelson himself, for—
He belongs to that great, strange com-
pany Australia has succeeded in winning
from the Old World, men like Marcus
Clarke, Brunton Stephens and Adam
Gordon —men who became more Australian
than the Australians.
Bayldon, he says, has been dowered with
many gifts and not the gift of worldly suc-
cess. (Bayldon, by the way, is not a
Scotchman.) He has done many things well;
but he does not make money. One thing
he does surpassingly well:
As a book-canvasser he certainly stands
alone, towering above all the motley crew
like a veritable colossus. Once he gained
an entrance into a house his book was as
good as sold —sometimes to every member
of the family. For he had a masterful
manner and an arresting gift of eloquence.
“Do you love poetry?” he would ask, in-
sinuatingly. Whether the answer was nega-
tive or affirmative, he would at once pro-
ceed to pour himself out on the subject.
“Poetry,” he would cry, standing in the
middle of the room, gesticulating, “is the
voice of God in the heart of man. As Shelley
has said, poets are the unacknowledged
legislators of mankind.” And then would
follow a really powerful and dramatic
oration on all the poets, ancient and modern.
The family, as a rule, would be entranced,
and an hour or two later the exhausted
rhetorician would sally forth, carrying with
him the names of perhaps half a dozen sub-
scribers in his pocket-boook, and leaving
behind him a memory never to be effaced.
There are lots of good things in this book,
and the best is the robustious personality
of the journalist-politician who wrote it.
There ought not to have been much pain
in producing a poem of this kind:
’Twas in a drawer, this little drawer,
Ah, I remember well,
There lay a tiny copper coin.
I looked, was tempted, fell.
I took it “just for luck,” and yet
I feel ’tis no disgrace;
For, for ,that tiny halfpenny
A penny I replace.
About the best thing in the book was in-
spired by the death of the poet John David-
son:
I am tired of life and its ceaseless toil,
Of the earth and its star-gemmed dome.
It is time at last to make an end,
To bid farewell to foe and friend,
To take the short cut home!

E. J. Brady has coneocted a read-
able book for boys out of the ad-
ventures of two young rips on an
Australian river, which might be the
Coldstream, or the Clarence. Tom Pagdin
Pirate (Bookstall Co.) owes a good deal
to Tom Sawyer; but its local habitation
gives it a local interest. The brisk narra-
tive is not improved by such extrinsic or-
naments as, “the puntman took no more
notice of him than the Suffete of ancient
Carthage might have taken of a crippled
slave.” And this writer will not believe
that Pagdin jun. ever said, “Dead melons
tell no tales.” Brady’s unadorned prose is
good, and in a boys’ story the classic flour-
ish and the epigram are out of place. Mark
Twain knew better. ” .

E. Dyson’s Tommy the Hawker and his
hoy Snifter (Bookstall Co.) met with sur-
prising experiences on their journey. If
they did not have “three full meals of
trouble” every day, they had hilarious ad-
ventures with spielers, wild men, or China-
men, did some amateur bushranging and
cattle-lifting, and generally made life in-
teresting. Dyson’s characters talk in the
manner of their kind, and they provide in-
nocent recreation for an hour or two.

The London Nation, of February 4 last,
reviews J. Le Gay Brereton’s To-morrow,
with other poetic dramas, and says that the
Sydney man’s one-act play, relating to
Robert Greene, is “evidently the work of
a man in whom an unmistakably dramatic
talent has been stimulated by study of
Elizabethan methods to its own native and
individual expression; it has learnt from its
great exemplars how to make personalities
reveal themselves in poetry clearly and yet
subtly, and how to make poetry add swift-
ness and vividness to. an action, instead of
encumbering an action with superfluous
beauty.” That is high praise, as anyone
acquainted with modern poetic drama will
know. The Nation concludes: “ To-morrow
is a remarkable and genuinely poetic play.”

A new edition of the letters of R.L.S.,
edited by Sidney Colvin, is announced by
Methuen. It will be in four vols., at ss,
each, and will include 150 letters previously
unpublished.
A book of verses called Wheat and Tares,
by “Elodie” (Vardon and Sons, Adelaide),
gieets the reader with a portrait of the
author, a foreword stating that “the verses
on each printed page X wrote with tears
and pain,” and a dedication “to all whose
hearts are sorrow-worn.” The author is
confident that “wheat” preponderates in her
little book, and if simple rhymes about
common-place thoughts, in which tears and
tiredness and sorrow are frequently men-
tioned, can be regarded as wheat or corn or
balm of Gilead by afflicted persons, well,
then, here’s plenty of it.

Bronchitis Cure
The Grandest Remedy in the World for
COUGHS & COLDS
ONE DOSE IS GENERALLY SUFFICIENT.
THOSE who have taken this medicine are amazed at
its splendid healing power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Asthma, Hoarseness, Difficulty
of Breathing, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience
delightful and rapid relief; and to those who are subject
to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a
complete cure. It is most comforting in allaying Irrita-
tion in the Throat and giving Strength to the Voice,
and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption is
not known where “ Coughs ” have, on their first appear-

Clements Tonic for Women
«T A testimony from a
' Melbourne woman,
stating what the great nerve
and blood medicine,
Clements Tonic has done
for her and can further do
for hundreds of others*
CLEMENTS
TONIC
SAVED MY LIFE!
344 Ross Street,

CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
♦‘The three doctors that
attended me agreed that my
case was nervous prostration.
Although I had the best medi-
cal attention, I got no better.
I was then an inmate of three
Melbourne Hospitals. I tried
the Convalescent Home, was
sent to Ararat in hope that
the change of climate might
do me good, with no better
result, I only took sufficient
food to keep me alive, sleep
was a stranger to me, when a
lady inmate of one hospital
advised me to take Clements
Tonic. When I had taken
two bottles I could feel the
blood flowing through my
veins, my nerves steady, and
the longed-for refreshing sleep
came to me, and I am now
restored to perfect health.
You may use my testimony
for the sake of women who
are ill.”
(Signed) ROSE FORD.
The general opinion of
Clements Tonic is that it is
unequalled for creating vital
strength and appetite in all
cases of lassitude, anaemia,
poor appetite, melancholia, or
weakness. All chemists and
stores sell this great medicine
in Australia. It will make
your life long. Get it.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is a tonic
and alterative, free from alcohol.
What is a “ tonic ” ? A medicine
that imparts strength or tone; a
medicine that builds up, gives
vigor and power. What is an
‘ ‘ alterative ” ? A medicine that
alters or changes unhealthy ac-
tion to healthy action. Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla does all this with-
out stimulation. Ask your doc-
tor if a family medicine, like
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, is not vastly
better without alcohol than
with it.

Which he makes a larger profit. You know the

MR. G. VECSEY.
Mr. Veosey discovered and per*

that bears his name.
FATAL
VARICOSE VEINS !
It is not at all uncommon for a Varicose Vein, which has
previously (riven no cause for alarm, to suddenly burst, and
thereafter to (rive years of trouble and distress, even if death
does not follow immediately as a result of the rupture.
If you have suffered philosophically in the past from
Varicose Veins, or from a Varicose Ulcer, make up your
mind that from the moment you read this announcement
your days of sufferihjr ore numbered. Previously Varicose
Veins have been considered incurable, except by removal,
which of all ways was the least likely to permanently benefit
the sufferer.
Varicose Veins and Varicose Ulcers are dangerous com-
plaints that should not be borne philosophically. Any day
may see disaster overtake the victim of this disease.
THE VECSEY METHOD OF TREATMENT
offers relief to every man or woman who suffers from Varicose Veins, and it offers an absolute cure to
98 per cent, of all sufferers, without laying up or detention from business. SAFE and RELIABLE.
A treatment of local application only, it rapidly relieves and steadily and successfully cures whenever
used. It is a painless method, and essentially a home treatment. No matter if you have suffered for
years, it will afford you permanent relief, and a few weeks' application will produce a complete and
lasting cure.
FREE BOOK. FREE ADVICE. CONSULTATION FREE.
Send a 2d. stamp for full particulars, and our free and useful illustrated book, which fully describes
Varicose Veins, their effects and their cure by the Vecsey Method. Send to-day. Call for free con-
sultation, if convenient. Hours : 9 a.m. till 5 p.m. daily! Consultation and Advice Free.

“ It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I

Habit by your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after
using tobacco heavily for seven years, sometimes
Boz. to lOoz. in the week. It is now 12 months
since I last used tobacco, and, although I am con-
tinually in the company of smokers, I do not have
the least desire to smoke, therefore I consider
the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my
former complaints, such as irregular Heart
Action, Dizziness, Nervousness and Stomach
Trouble, which I have every reason to believe
were caused through the use of tobacco, have en-

fit to face the world again. It will give me great

The Moment.
Who threads the desert, Life,
In darkness, and with murmur in his soul
Restless and urgent as a fever-voice :
Haste, that we gain, beyond the desert, Day —
Sooner or later through the blackened hours
Comes to the wall that halts him, higher than
sight.
He watches upward : sees
Steal to a little door a form, a blur—
A beckoning hand above the gulf, a glance
At gaze and like a falling star.
Her song, the song of Chance
Is singing from that moment, like a wave—
From the loosed gate of Fortune, dreamt by kings,
From that veiled height lost in the towering stars,
From a hid throat, darker than shadow at moon-
set,
Into the heaven
‘ ‘ No more, no more
Will my bounty pour
Beyond this chance of the loosened Door —
This the Moment to mar or make 1
Drayons-at-watch . from the drowse of sleep
In the following heartpulse stir and creep
And the searching beams of the sunray shake
The world awake — Oh, work your wilt
Now Time is dreaming and Hours are still!
0 lover, swift to.my heart, and hold
Chance yet once, ere the World s gaze rolled
Back to the Gate like a star of light
Bar the path with its scorching sight ,
And the arrows of dawn forbid the door
Where my songs outpour
Xonys of the Moment, of seizing, of chance, of night,
No more.'' . . .
And who heeds the call ?
Waverers, waverers at the wall,
Clothed in Caution and shod with Doubt,
Dragging Convention your paths about—
Long, long, Oh, long is the Moment past
When you steal to the little gate at last 1

Explorers.
Ye that through all a thousand miles of doubt
Tracking the river know at length success,
Feel the wild spray sting salt upon your face,
Hail the long breakers with a feeble shout,
And, daring not to stay, turn you about
To crawl with stalking Death a bitter race,
Smitten by your unspeakable weariness
To age, that had in heady youth set out.
What landmarks of despair ye labored past,
What baffling currents fought and burning wind
What madness going beside you dreadfully,
Who shall declare? Not ye, that scarce can find
Breath through parched lips to mutter ere ye cast
Your burden from you. Ye have reached the
sea!

The Quest.
“ Can this be love ? ” I cried, and so with strong
Glad passionate hands clasped her and held her
fast;
But found dead bones within my arms ere long
And knew her for damnation at the last.
“ Can this be love ? ” I said, and bent my head
To reap the harvest of her lips, and find
The secret long elusive ; but she fled,
And Hell was vocal in the clamorous wind.
" Can this be love ? ” I whispered, and her eyes
Smiled softly on me, and her pure proud face
Was gracious, and her lips were Paradise.
She faded, and night closed upon that place.
A tremor unfamiliar stirs my blood,
Born of no radiance in the skies above.
I only knew that life is strangely good
And sweet, and She is here . . . Can this be love ?

The Rain.
The rain it falls
On righteous folk
As well as we
Who laugh and joke.
The moral man
In right paths set
Cannot escape
The falling wet;
So I enjoy
The feeling quaint
That I am some-
what like a saint.
And yet I see
When I am damp
The righteous oft
Is with a gamp ;
And under it
He snugly talks
Of sin’s reward ;
And drily walks.
But sometimes we
Who are not good,
Rise to a high-
Er altitude.
We borrow it—
Or we decamp
With some pure saint’s
Convenient gamp.
And whilst we dry-
Ly walk the town,
Upon the saint
The rain comes down.

FOREMOST amongst the many Mantles paraded for the gas consumer’s inspec-
tion is the Welsbach Mantle. It is because of Welsbach Mantles that other
Mantles 6xist. First in the field, it revolutionised gas lighting, and its
phenomenal success has introduced many imitators. Other Mantles are some-
what like Welsbach Mantles in appearance at first, but come to compare them
after 2000 hours' use, and you will find a big difference—a difference all in favor
of the Welsbach Mantle. It is the secret Welsbach fluid with which the Mantle
is impregnated that accounts for its remarkable strength, brilliancy and durability.

YEARS ago it was considered the height of outdoor pleasure to sit
behind a fast horse or team, and it was indeed the most
pleasurable motion obtainable in those days.
Bin how it pales into insignificance compared with the smooth,
-swift rush through the air of the motor of to-day ! Ihe old coaching
pace seems very tame —a mere crawl beside the glorious : .niotion of the
modern car.
The possessor of a modern motor car is able to experience all the ex-
hilaration of flying while comfortably esconced in a well-upholstered seat.
There is no jar or shaking, no exertion while inhaling quantities of
life-giving, healthful ozone.
Here are the cars that are synonymous with speed and safety :
DAIMLER, AUSTIN, DELAUNAY-BELLEVILLE,

These are the makes of cars that enable the purchaser to be SURE of these
advantages. They are the best cars made, therefore the best for Australia.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin," is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any

ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the
form of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse,
Short Talcs or Sketches (those dealing with Aus-
tralian subjects, and not exceeding two columns in
length, or, say, 3000 words, are specially accept-
able), Paragraphs, Letters or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS.
when the address is specified and stamps are en-
closed. But no MS. will be returned, or preserved,
■unless these conditions are observed. When MS. is
forwarded without stamps for return it will be un-
derstood that the copy is to be destroyed if not ac-
ceptable. Personal applications for return of MS.
cannot receive attention. The Bulletin desires,
further, those sending MS. to distinctly understand
that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.

A GIGANTIC ERROR AND THE DES-
PERATE EFFORT THAT IS BEING
MADE TO RECTIFY IT.
The Anti-Labor Press still discusses Com-
missioner Sinclaie’s remark that Australia
is the “saddest country he had ever seen,”
owing to its class distinctions, and it con-
tinues to derive from the remark the chas-
tened satisfaction which often attaches to a
Gredt Grief. Said Sydney Telegbaph the
other day, luxuriating in its misery:—
Australia occupies a position more unique than
the dolorously singular one to which Mr. Sinclair
has elevated her. No other people in the world
carry class distinctions to the extent in politics that
Australians do. No other country has a dominant
trades-unionist party in politics. The British work-
man may be at once a good unionist and a Whig or
a Tory in politics. In the United States, where
there is as fierce a play of industrial warfare as in
any other country in the world, the trade unionist
carries his class consciousness no further than the
street on to which opens the factory or shop door.
In the political arena, he is a Republican or a Demo-
crat the same as his employer. Even Maoriland, the
world’s object-lesson in advanced social legislation,
haa never been rent asunder by political partisanships
based on trade considerations.
Stress is laid on the shocking ethical condi-
tion of a country which can behave in such
a fashion. Melbourne Abgus considers that
the thing is “un-Christian.” The Age and
S. M. Hebald and the Adelaide Registeb
bewail the calamity as one Gummidge. And
the language which their sympathisers use
on the subject would earn them rasping fines
if employed within hearing of the Law.
Some facts on which they are all agreed are
that party government should not be con-
ducted on Labor and Anti-Labor lines any
more, and that there should —in fact, must
■ —be some other political issue.

In the circumstances it is worth consider-
ing who was originally responsible for the
existing state of affairs. As recently as six
years ago, Laborites were hopelessly di-
vided on fiscal, sectarian and a dozen other
issues. Thus, in West Sydney, W. M.
Hughes —whom Property now considers
the last word in Rapine—was regularly ac-
corded almost a block York-street vote, as
a Freetrader. And he earned it. Also he got a
solid Yellow Pup vote, the N.S.W. variety of
the animal being convinced that the surest
way to madden the Vatican is to keep the
mostly-Romanist manufacturers and workers
of Continental Europe in affluence by im-
porting their products. On the other hand,
in such typically working-men’s constitu-
encies as Dailey, East Sydney and King,
ultra-Conservatives of the freetrade persua-
sion were returned repeatedly by huge ma-
jorities against Protectionist Democrats,
partly because they got the Property sup-
port, to which they were legitimately entitled,
but chiefly because they got the support of
working men, who were spellbound by the
Cobden spook. It was the same in the
other States. Everywhere the Laborite
found a fiscal issue glaring at him from
the hoardings; and because old habits cling,
and the public is a sap-headed lot in the
mass, Victorian Protectionist workers went
on voting for reactionaries like Knox of the
hat, and in N.S.W. Freetrade Labor men
barracked wildly for politicians of. the
Pumpkin Smith and James Conkoy stamp.

There came a black hour for Right-
thinkers when G. H. Reid, came to the con-
clusion that as an office-snaring cry Free-
trade was dead. It could still be used to
split the democratic vote, and so hold up
practically all progressive legislation. Also,
it might be effectively employed to modify
and, in spots, emasculate the tariff. But
there its usefulness ended. Reid, who
had sold Sydney’s prospect of being the
Federal Capital for a Prime Ministership, of
which he was ultimately cheated, resolved on
another deal or spec. Heedless of the infuri-
ated protests of Faked, Invoice and Co.,
Fluff Bbos. and the rest, he decided on the
interment of foreign trade. The Tory news-
papers were short-sighted enough to back
him. The Anti-Socialistic campaign began.
For months Reid roamed the country assur-
ing the electors that a Tiger had arrived in
their midst, by comparison with which Pro-
tection was a mere circumstance. He
claimed that Labor —whose vilest efforts to
date had consisted of advocating an Aus-
tralian Navy ; Citizen Service, the restric-
tion of public borrowing and certain hu-
manitarian legislation—was Socialism, and
that Socialism signified anarchy, atheism
and a burst marriage tie. Electors of all
classes were urged to sink fiscalism and
every other conviction, and get together for
the purpose of scotching the new menace.
The daily papers began to label the Labor
party the Socialist party. Long before the
finish of Reid’s campaign—a campaign
which was distinguished by more incredi-
bilities and vulgar melodrama than any
within human recollection—the less bat-eyed
in the Conservative ranks had begun dimly
to suspect that a Master Error had been
perpetrated. When the election returns
appeared they were quite sure of it. But
they didn’t fully appreciate the damage
Reid had done till three years later.
The general election of April 13, 1910,
demonstrated a host of things, all very un-
pleasant to the Tory. It showed what was
liable to happen when the workers of a coun-
try like Australia are driven into one camp
and given a chance to vote the democratic
ticket, unhampered by any side-issues. Free-
trade being relegated to the ash-heap, one
West, a plumber, hitherto unknown to
fame, easily won G. H. Reid’s old seat —a
seat which had been held by a Freetrade
Tory since the beginning of things. Orange-
ism failed to establish its point that the
Pope of Rome favored the Democratic party,
and would be epileptic with rage if the other
side won ; so Wilks, and a number of others
like _ him, were cast into oblivion. Protec-
tionist Laborites in Victorian constituencies
like Maribyrnong, Ballarat and Kooyong
worked and voted for the first time in their
lives against the sitting members, and on
behalf of candidates concerning whose fiscal
views they hadn’t troubled to enquire.
“Safe” Conservative seats fell broadcast
with the dull, decisive thud of 19cwt. of
cement dropping from a great height. Syd-
ney Telegbaph referred to the occurrence
as a “ debacle .” For a day or two the dupe
who had credited the grotesque warnings of
the Anti-Sosh leaders, and voted accordingly,
peered apprehensively round in quest of
tumbrils and other revolutionary imple-
ments. They never materialised, and he
swiftly dropped back into the old rut. And
the party which had been consolidated by
Reid’s crass bit of political idiocy got busy
with its appointed task.
* * * *
Conservatism thus fell into a desperately
bad way. It is in the deep sea, and the
Devil has got it as well. In a straight-out
contest with the consolidated forces of Pro-
gress, it would not have a vestige of a hope;
and it is aware of the fact. Lord Randolph
Chubchill observed 20 years ago that it
was vitally important for his party to
“divide the Irish.” The enthusiastic sup-
port William O’Beien got last month from
the British Tories indicates that Chub-
chill’s policy still holds good. And the
Tories of Australia are also so situated that
they must divide their opponents, or see a
mass of democratic legislation put in the
Statute Book. State Rights is the weapon
that “Liberalism,” alias Anti-Sosh, relies on
to rip up the party which Reid fatuously
consolidated. All over the Commonwealth
vested interests are hard at work explaining
that though they approve of the New Protec-
tion, and agree with the Common Rule, yet
they violently object to the Referenda pro-
posals as a whole, because the excision of
the Trade and Commerce clause will cause
the States to be robbed of their “rights.”
Lies, as preposterous as those which did
service in the discredited Anti-Sosh cam-
paign, are being exploited freely. Last week
a Sydney morning paper suggested that, as
a result of voting “Yes.” Sydney tram
guards’ hours might be fixed in Yass, or
Dubbo’s sewerage be controlled from Mel-
bourne, while the Commonwealth might up-
set the regulations of the Engine-street tiut
markets, and regulate the building of the
Barren Jack dam. By such crude absurdi-
ties it is designed to divorce a certain type
of Labor man from a party which, so long
as it stands together, is invincible. It is as
strange as it is true that already numbers
of workers have been seduced into the Anti-
Labor camp on the States Rights ticket,
and there is an unpleasant possibility or
more drifting the same way as the battle
warms up. Labor’s winning margin was
none too big in any of the States last April.
Assuming Anti-Labor secures anything like
general support from those queer Demo-
crats” who, while claiming to approve ot
progressive legislation, are _ unwilling to
hand the power to provide it to the only
authority capable of delivering the goods,
lest it should go raving mad and embezzle
the “rights” of various N.S.W. fruit-vendors
and sewage-employees, the cause of demo-
cracy is in for a notable set-back. Nothing
else can harm it. “Liberalism, which
used to be Anti-Socialism, is out to split
Labor, as its one hope on earth of getting
back to the position it lost in 190 b. Is La-
bor going to fall in?
WHAT IS PARLIAMENT FOR?
The periodical Labor Conferences, now that
they talk directly to the Men at the Wheel,
are getting on the nerves of people whose
ideas of democratic government are stiff-
jointed or rusty for want of exercise. Many
years ago, when the people of England grew
tired of being bossed by an irresponsible
ruler who might or might not have a thought
beyond his personal pleasures or interests,
they adopted, after various experiments, the
practice of having their laws made or partly
made by an assembly of men more or less
chosen by themselves for that purpose. The
intention was to get together a company of
the best-qualified men in the country, to use
their brains in the interests of the people.
The experiment wasn’t much of a success.
The average M.P. in those days may have
been up to the intellectual level of the
present—which is not saying too much for
him—but he was certainly not so well in-
structed in the essentials of his office, neither
had he the opportunities for self-instruction
that the average man, whether a member of
Parliament or not, has to-day. Still, the
average king had proved such an awful
failure as a means of governing the country
that the more or less representative Parlia-
ment was a distinct step in advance, be-
cause it brought the people who had to obey
the laws closer up to the men who made
them. The gradual broadening of the Par-
liamentax-y franchise has had for its justifi-
cation this same principle. The idea that
Parliament is an assembly of wise men
whose business it is to think and manage
for the rest of the people, as a father thinks
and manages for his children, has been
abandoned. Democratic government, what-
ever its merits or demerits, is not an ab-
stract idea. It is a plain, definite accept-
ance of all the rifijks involved in letting the
people have their way, instead of the risks
involved in preventing them from having
their way.
* * * *
Exi>erience shows that, as a rule, the
class which controls the powers of govern-
ment will use those powers in the first place
for the benefit of that Class. And this rule
holds good whether the executive authority
is exercised by a so-called absolute mon-
archy, or by an oligarchy, or an aristocracy,
or a Parliament chosen by a smaller or
larger section of the population. In Aus-
tralia it has been deliberately decided that
the risks attaching to “mob government”
are less than those which history, past and
present, shows to be part and parcel of gov-
ernment by privileged classes. All classes
of the community have concurred in
tnis choice, and each political party
in turn has done its share in tak-
ing away the power of government from
the few and giving it to the many ; and this
without regard to the individual fitness of
the few or tiie individual unfitness of the
many. At last, and much more slowly than
nngnt reasonably have been expected, the
logical consequences of this devolution of
political powers are beginning to show
themselves. The masses of the people, who
have not as great a share of the things
tnat cost money or labor as that section
which formerly controlled the government,
have decided to use the machinery in their
own interests —which is no more or less
than “the classes” did previously. Having
drawn a line cutting all the wealth of the
country into two equal parts, it became
visible at once that the owners of one-half
were much more numerous, and therefore
individually much poorer, than the owners
of the other half. But, being more numer-
ous, they have more votes, and therefore
more powers of taxation and even of con-
fiscation. The rich are always in the
minority, and in a country where each adult
has an equal share in fixing the basis of
taxation, they are consequently always at
the mercy of the not-rich. This is, of
course, not a very comfortable reflection for
the rich; but it might be a great deal worse.
In countries where the non-rich have had
no share whatever in fixing the basis of
taxation, it has again and again happened
that the rich have suddenly found them-
selves at the not too-tender mercy of the
very poor, the starving and the desperate.
Then the lamp-posts have been turned into
gibbets—and even a land-tax is less dread-
ful than that.
* * * *
Until recent time the routine work of a
British Parliament included little more
than the raising of revenue and the pro-
vision for national defence. An extra job
turned up now and again, when a vacancy
on the throne required filling ;• but Parlia-
ment interfered very little with the busi-
ness affairs of the people, beyond attempt-
ing to secure cheap and servile labor for the
“masters.” Even when the destruction of
life by the overwork of children and the en-
forced neglect of infants by the working
mothers had brought the average duration
of human life down to eight or nine years,
men like John Bright fought tooth and
nail in Parliament against any restriction
of the number of hours that employers could
work women and children. In the same
way and in the same spirit, Parliamentary
interference with the practice of sending
sailors to sea in coffin-ships was bitterly
opposed. Parliament was not for such
things as that, it was argued. But as more
people and poorer people acquired tne power
of influencing the composition of Parlia-
ment, so the interests of more people and
poorer people demanded —and obtained—
Parliamentary consideration; and legisla-
tion, designed to check private greed, ceased
to provoke angry cries that Parliament was
throttling liberty. It began to be recognised
that Parliament was an institution which
could be made useful for other work than
that for which it had been originally
created ; and the men who were chosen as
members began to receive instruction from
those who chose them, wdth an intimation
that their business in Parliament was to
follow those instructions.
From this out, the position of a member
of Parliament took a change. Hitherto, he
had been a free member of a national com-
mittee, bound by no rule not made oy that
committee, and invested with full powers
to act on behalf of the nation in any matter
that might chance to turn up. Henceforth,
he became a mere delegate on at least one
question, with the implied obligation to be
as nearly a delegate as possible—that is,
so far as he was able, to ascertain the wishes
of his constituents —on every other question.
And that is what the member of Parliament
is to-day. No longer is he a man chosen
because of his superior wisdom to think out
and solve problems on behalf of the great
body of the people; he is now an official to
carry out instructions. The great body of
the people by this time claims to be quite
able to solve its problems itself; at any
rate, it prefers to take the chances of its
own mistakes, rather than risk the mis-
takes of someone else, however wise the
somebody else may be. And it is to register
and exercise the will of the people that
Parliament now exists. That is what it is
for. Some very fine eloquence has been
called forth on the sacredness of members’
honest convictions, and so forth, and we
have had dreadful pictures of the degrada-
tion that is involved in the surrender of
personal judgment at the dictates of a
Labor Conference. The surrender of honest
convictions for the sake of office, Parlia-
mentary or other, is ignoble. But the sub-
mission of a member of Parliament to the
will of the people is a duty. It is for him
to obey and not betray. To this submission
the only honest alternative is the resigna-
tion of office.
* * * *
But admitting that the purpose of Par-
liament is now to register the will of those
who chose it, does it follow that it should
be the registrar of a Labor Conference,
which is itself only a delegation from a
minority of the electors? If the majority
of the electors have so decided, who is to
challenge the decision? The majority of
the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and
of the South Aus. and N.S.W. Assemblies,
have been elected on the distinct under-
standing that their actions in Parliament
are to be guided by the Political Labor
Leagues. Not one of the members, of the
present Parliamentary Labor parties can
be accused of having hidden that fact from
those whose votes they sought. However
true it may be that the Labor Leagues only
include a minority of the electors, the fact
remains that the majority of the electors,
by voting for the league candidates, have
authorised the elected members to take their
working instructions from the leagues and
the leagues’ conferences. If there is any
such thing as a mandate from an electorate
to its representative, that mandate has been
plainly given; for every one of the. chosen
Labor members has signed and publicly ac-
knowledged his submission to these leagues
and to their delegates in conference. It is
quite too late, then, for anyone to assume a
shocked or surprised attitude at the sight
of members of Parliament receiving instruc-
tions from a Labor Conference. They have
been definitely elected by the adult men and
women of the State on the distinct under-
standing that they were to receive their in-
structions from that authority.. If. the
electors think that the instructions given
by the Labor Conference are not wise, ana
therefore conclude that, the Labor Confer-
ence is not to be trusted with the issue of
orders to members of Parliament, then they
will decline to again elect men who are
bound to obey those orders: That is simple
enough. The decision lies with the majority
of the electors, not with the Labor Confer-
ence. That body has to satisfy the people
who voted for the men comprising the pre-
sent Labor majority that it is a competent
authority, sound and sane, and fit to be
trusted with the job of guiding Parlia-
ment in the direction that the majority of
the electors want it to go. If the present
N.S.W. Parliament carries out the orders
of the State Labor Conference with reason-
able fidelity, it will do what the electors
placed it in power for. The. electors may
be sorry or glad, but that is beside the
question. The theory of democratic Parlia-
mentary government is that the people
shall rule, and Parliament is only the in-
strument through which it rules. If the
democracy decides that a Labor Conference
or an Employers’ Conference shall also be
one of its instruments, and shall work in
conjunction with Parliament, who is. to
contest its right to Come to such a decision !
Those who find fault with the submission
of members of Parliament to the Labor Con-
ference must take their complaint further
back, and lay the charge at the doors of the
Constitution.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Referenda: An Estimate.
During the past week Anti-Laborites have
been busy discussing the “Prospects of the
Referenda.” The customary whooping note
of confidence that has persistently preceded
Tory reverses in the past is audible. A Mel-
bourne writer actually announced that the
Australian Government had in despair given
up all real interest in the campaign—this at
a time when Fisher. Hughes and the


others were battling daily on_ behalf of the
proposals in the country districts, Low-
wage enthusiasts assert loudly that tnen
cause is safe, but they cautiously av °* a
details. No doubt certain block votes
against the amendments are sure. hjvery
manufacturer of the unfair type—-the em-
ployer who aspires to grab as much financial
benefit as possible from the tariff,
keeping his employees on the old b reetrade
wage-mark—may be relied on to work and
vote for “Liberalism” with frantic energy.
By his side will be found the outrageously
expensive, and consequently affluent mon-
opolies—gas, tramway, sugar and shipping
and their apologists, William McLinen,
Bruce Smith and Co. The considerable
army of semi-illiterates who are incapable
of independent thought, but who have a
vague impression that Labor is a wild and
demented animal, will go the way they
have gone in the past. They include every
Wimmen’s League in the country, the rank
and file of “goffers,” bowlers, croquet-players
and so forth; Wowserdom, male and female;
and practically all who have got sufficiently
close to a Government House ‘to feel en-
titled to criminally libel a Governor. And
then there are the State Frighters, proto-
types of the absurd old Geebung folks, who
regarded their neighbors across the border as
foreigners and enemies, and rebuked
strangers who referred to them as “Aus-
tralians” with the words, “No, sir; resi-
dents of the Colony of So and So.” It is a
deplorable fact that their ranks are_ aug-
mented by a few false-alarm .Laborites —
State politicians mostly, who think more of
hanging on to every shred of importance that
attaches to the State Laborite’s job than
they do of benefiting the wage-earner or the
Commonwealth at large. On the “Yes” side
will be found every unionist who grasps the
issues at stake, and who, being outside a
State Parliament, is able to take an impar-
tial view of that costly anachronism. The
Australian vote —the vote of the man who,
while not necessarily a unionist or
even a Laborite, is sick of anomalies
like State Governors, Legislative Coun-
cils, and the nullifying of legislation
which the country has demanded—will be
cast for the Nationalist proposals. Remain
the waverers, the battalions of the un-
pledged, who are influenced by other consid-
erations than those which affect keen party
voters, and who often sway elections. On
the present showing Nationalism will win
their support. These doubtful ones are
mostly fairly intelligent, fairly observant,
and in favour of clean fighting. They lined
up solidly against the Fuse last year, partly
because they recognised the essential dis-
honesty of a coalition between a Deakin
and a Cook, partly as a protest against the
flaming lies that were circulated regarding
Labor aims. The same conditions prevail
to-day. Deakin and Cook are still in coali-
tion, and with them are allied all the dan-
gerous forces of monopoly in the country.
And the same old revolting lies are told
with fresh trimmings. Who believes, for in-
stance, that either Betjce Smith or his friend
Lee have the faintest intention of spilling
blood or fomenting a revolution if the pro-
posals are carried? Who believes that Syd-
ney Daily Telegraph or the Melbourne
Argus dreads lest “Yes” may mean lower
wages? Who believes that the Federal Ar-
bitration Court is going to “interfere with
the business of bottle-accumulators,” or that
the Federal Government will “turn the Com-
monwealth upside down,” or do any of the
other asinine things that are forecasted by
State Frightism? Yet if these preposterous
allegations are not credited, the case for the
Anti-Referenda party falls to the ground;
and those who refuse to be bluffed by the
“arguments” will support the party which
isn’t depending on crude lies to score a win.
A Factor Which Helps to Keep Australia
Empty.
Three years ago a distinguished Australian
was in Carmelite House with Lord North-
cliffe, the proprietor of the Daily Mail.
The big newspaper man was asked why the
Mail decried Australia so persistently.
Nortiicliffe answered: “We print no more
than the truth.” The Australian said —“At
a rough estimate five-eighths of the stuff
your paper has published in the last six
months has been incorrect.” Harmsworth
rang a bell, gave an order, and the office
specialist in Australian affairs entered. He
had with him, carefully filed and dated, a
pile of newspaper reports of Anti-Labor
speeches by G. H. Reid, W. McMillan, St.
Leger, Judkins, Bruce Smith, Bigjohn
Forrest and so forth; also, a mass of ar-
ticles shorn from organs like Melbourne
Argus and Sydney Telegraph. “Can you,”
asked Harmsworth, “show me anything
that has appeared in the Mail which is half
so derogatory to Australia as these state-
ments on which ours are based?” And the
Australian had nothing to say. It is a de-
pressing fact that, during recent years, all
the yarns retailed oversea, with the object of
injuring Australia, have been beaten out of
sight, in the matter of venom and compre-
hensiveness, by the efforts of local politicians.
The Australian Tory is probably the only
specimen of his kind in the world who, in
order to gain some petty political score,
freely slanders land where he gets his
living. The original opponents of the Alien
Immigration Restriction Act —the rational
measure which Britain adopted the other
day—did not scruple, in the* attempt to
scoop a few votes, to represent that Austra-
lian Government officials had pushed drown-
ing niggers back into the sea, in accordance
with the barbarous laws of the country. The
Petriana lie still cruises round in foreign parts,
and does Australia damage. George Reid’s
Anti-Socialist campaign convinced thou-
sands in the United Kingdom, and on the
Continent, that the Australian Labor party
—the party which the electors of the Com-
monwealth have chosen to govern them —is
composed of reckless, home-bursting Anar-
chists and brigands. It is certain that the
asinine talk about “spoliation,” “robbery”
and “confiscation by the Commonwealth,”
which “Liberalism” is now using against the
Referenda proposals, is all being stored up
for future use, not only by sheets like the
Mail, but by Canadian and other immigra-
tion agents, whose business -it is to divert
immigfation from this country. As this
paper has remarked before, there should be
some means of legally punishing Australia’s
purveyors of Decayed Fish. A term of penal
servitude would hardly atone for the damage
some of them have done.
State Fruit and State Frights.
The Age the other day left off cursing the
proposals to extend the powers of the Com-
monwealth, and for a few minutes cursed
instead the existing system of inter-State
fruit inspection. It is a very bad system,
which is having, as the Age says, “the effect
of provoking unnecessary bitterness, while
the expense involved appears to be an un-
just tax on the fruit-grower.” A couple of
years ago Victoria started condemning
N.S.W. oranges, said to be diseased, and
charged heavy fees for inspecting all im-
ported fruit. N.S.W. retaliated by “inspect-
ing” Victorian apples and pears. Steadily
the inspection business has grown, and the
fees have grown also, until fruit-exporters
in both States have been driven nearly des-
perate. Other States have followed the bad
example, so that the free exchange of fruit,
which should have been one of the blessings
of Federation, has been badly interfered
with, and threatens to cease altogether. The
effect is now just the same .as if the old Cus-
toms duties were in force. Instead of “du-
ties” “fees” are charged, but the result is
the same. The declaration of the Common-
wealth Constitution for inter-State freetrade
is thoroughly defeated. The Age knows all
this, and, indeed, exposes the whole pitiful,
selfish Anti-Federal scandal. But, instead
of doing the right thing, and declaring that
the whole business should be handed over to
Federal control, it weakly recommends a
mere “conference of Ministers.” There
have already been conferences almost innum-
erable ; but the decisions which have been
come to have been side-tracked by a new
Minister, or in some other way, whereupon
the whole arrangement has fallen to the
ground. The rational plan is to pass the
work on to the one authority which can
definitely control the business in every State;
but that would mean an attack on State
Rights, and State Rights are being boomed
as sacrosanct at the moment. So the fruit-
growers, who are being harassed beyond en-
durance, will have to put up with their
grievance, just because the party which most
of them support would give its whole
case away if it handed the business over to
the one authority which can effectively deal
with it. This means, in plain language,
that the “Liberal” crowd is prepai'ed to con-
demn the fruit-growers to indefinite loss, an
“unjust tax” and harassment, rather than
risk its own political skin. All things con-
sidered, this ought to make the fruit-growers
very deeply attached to the “Liberal,” No-
No crowd. Very deeply attached indeed.
Victorian Hospital Sharks.
Wiixie Watt, the Victorian Treasurer, who
is not Avholly free from wise inspirations,
proposes to take a step in the direction of
nationalising the hospitals. He intends to
insist that the various hospitals in Mel-
bourne shall standardise their provisions and
surgical dressings, and enter into a joint
contract for the supply thereof. Hitherto
some hospitals have paid higher prices than
other hospitals for ordinary foods and neces-
saries, and Watt has grasped the fact that
a considerable percentage of the Government
subsidies was wasted in providing exorbitant
profits for middlemen. Incidentally, some
of the waste may be suspected of having
found its way into the pockets and larders
of other persons interested in the business.
At any rate, certain hospital committees of
yore contained names which stank abomin-
ably of jobbery and corruption; and even
now the price of common or dairy milk and
other goods seems to have a marvellously
wide range where the guardians of charit-
able institutions are concerned. Officially,
however, no charge of corruption seems to
be made; all that is plain, from the official
point of view, is that the control of some
of the hospitals has been in shockingly bad
business hands. Therefore the Government
takes some of the business out of the bad
hands. It doesn’t, however, propose to take
it all out. It still leaves the wretched busi-
ness people to muddle along in the old way
with regard to everything but the purchase
of foods, drugs, and appliances. For in-
stance, in regard to the collection of money,
it is certain there is a shocking waste, a
large proportion of the funds wormed out
of the public for the relief of the sick and
suffering being lost or consumed long be-
fore it reaches either class. Yet that shock-
ing waste Treasurer Willie Watt doesn’t
propose to stop. What he does intend to
do is good enough; but it is a half-baked re-
form at the best.

State Frights in Practice.
“W.C.M.” TELLS a tale of State Frights in
practice:—
The N.S.W. Decentralisation Commission dragged
a few more feet on its fatuous way when it reach-
ed Hay to collect evidence regarding the proposed
I-lay-Deniliquin railway line. This line has been
proposed for the last 25 years, and there has been
for that time a railway reserve quarter of a mile wide
extending' the whole 95 miles between the two
towns. The Commission took the same old evi-
dence as to needless haulage and cut freights de-
signed to drag everything to Sydney (480 miles),
and prevent trading with Melbourne (260 miles).
The Riverina part of N.S.W. is actively Victorian
in sympathy; the people mostly come from Vic-
toria ; Victorian capital has settled it; and more
trade is done with Victorian towns than with Syd-
ney. Yet to hinder as much as possible what can-
not be entirely checked, the N.S.W. Governments
have refused facilities for this trade, and so, while
retarding settlement, lose almost the whole where
they could retain a part. The Narrandera-llay ex-
tension, which was intended to collar the trade for
Sydney, is and always has been unprofitable. On
the other hand, the Deniliquin-Moama private line,
connecting with the Victorian lines, pays very fair
dividends and has a big reserve fund, though its
freights are higher, its trains slower, and every-
thing generally as doddering as Private Enterprise
can make it. A great part of the Riverina traffic
in wool and other heavy goods is carried by river.
This transit means slow barges and high freights
to Swan Hill or Echuca, to connect with the Vic-
torian railways. But, in any case, the rivers will
be required for irrigation purposes, especially the
Murrumbidgee and the Murray, and of necessity
navigation must give place to irrigation. So river
traffic can’t be relied upon in future. The ques-
tion is, Shall the district be choked in the insane
attempt to make it trade with Sydney, or prevent
it from trading at all; or shall N. S. Wales pro-
vide the means for the district to reach its natu-
ral outlet via Deniliquin ?
The writer has collected figures which show how
badly the Western Riverina is treated, and how
much the N.S.W. Government loses by its short-
sighted, almost criminal, policy. Stock consigned
from Hay to Sydney take 48 hours to reach its
destination, while if droved overland to Deniliquin
and there trucked to Melbourne, the time rarely
exceeds 20 hours, despite the break at Moarna. *
Last year there passed through Hay, era route to
Melbourne, 149,000 sheep, all trucked at Denili-
quin, while only 82,000 were trucked for Sydney
at Hay. So, in the absence of a line to connect
with Deniliquin, the State got nothing whatever
from the 149,000. Large numbers were sent to
Melbourne from other parts of the district. This
is a big trade lost entirely to N. S. W. railways.
But the trade should be larger, and more fac stock
certainly would be sent away—especially fat
lambs —were there decent facilities to land them
at market in condition. Fat lambs cannot, how-
ever, be droved to Deniliquin, as a rule; and to
try to land them at far-off Sydney is generally out
of the question.
Now look at the wool figures:—
By Rail.
From Hay .. . . .. .. 4,718 bales
From sidings between Hay and Carra-
thool .. .. .. .. 9,528 bales
Total by rail .. .. .. 14,246 bales
By River.
From Hay .. .. .. .. 6,948 bales
From sidings from Hay to Carrathool
(about) .. .. .. 17,000 bales
Total by river (about) .. .. 23,948 bales
The river carriage means that N.S.W. receives no-
thing, while if the proposed line leading to Deni-
liquin were built, fully three-quarters of tne total
would go by rail, freights being cheaper by rail
than by river. And if the Deniliquin-Moama line
(45 miles) were acquired by the Government, there
would be few branches so profitable. Besides, the
land along the proposed line would settle a great
number of farmers, most of the country being
wheat country, suitable for * dry-farming. In any
case, the average rainfall is between 13 (4 and 17
inches. Little wheat is grown at present, as
wheat does not pay for carriage more than 25 miles
from a railway.
The Decentralisation Commissioners took all this
in, and wandered away to pigeon-hole what has
been well known in the Public Works Department
and other offices for 25 years. But Hay and Deni-
liquin still remain dead towns, and the Western
Riverina continues a country of few sheep and
fewer people, and 110 miles of railway line
doesn’t pay for axle-grease, atid all because a
few people in Sydney have decided that the
country is not worth developing, if Sydney cannot
get a big bite out of it after it has been devel-
oped.

About a Departing Official.
“Maraud Safran” gives a cheer
I arise now that G.-G. Dudley is going, to accord
him a belated cheer. He has shown himself a nearer
approach to a Democrat than any other Governor the
Commonwealth has known. And he has displayed
the highest order of nerve. It is not a fashionable
thing to be a Home Ruler in Australia. The atti-
tude of our Best People towards Irish autonomy is
that of the provincial chapel-goer of England, the
sort of person who owns a complete edition of Silas
Hocking and forswears Newman’s hymns “on prin-
ciple.” Dudley practically opened his career here
with a public declaration of his belief in Home Rule
for Ireland.
At Sydney A., H. and P. Show, “Liberal” politi-
cians speechified against the Labor party in Dudley’s
presence. The procedure was hallowed by custom.
Every “Liberal” politician of any note, who had
attended at this function within human memory,
had “thrown off” at Labor for the delectation of
vice-regality. But Dudley didn’t appreciate it.
Moreover, he had the pTuelc to say so. In cold, acid
. terms he requested that nothing of the soft should
occur again when he was arpu’hd. The committee-
men, who had hitherto regained abuse of the Labor
party as a patent of gentility, and a proof that the
curser was solvent, and a leader of the upright life,
were stupefied.
Later, at a Sydney Town Hall banquet, a fervent
old local “Loyalist” poured ridicule on the idea of
an Australian navy. In those days the fool portion
of the public didn’t understand that it was the
British Admiralty which had suggested the Austra-
lian Navy scheme, even going so far in its eagerness
to see this country do a fair thing by the Empire,
as to offer (1) to forego the £200,000 a year sub-
sidy-money paid by Australia, and (2) to pay Aus-
ralia £250,000 a year, for a lengthy term, to help
get the incipient fleet going. The “respectable*’
view was what whoever advocated a local or “mos-
quito fleet, as it was brightly called, was either an
idiot or a particularly malignant va'riety of dis-
loyalist. The aged orator’s degrading boasts about
the incapacity of his countrymen to defend them-
selves, on sea or elsewhere, were greeted with cheers
and a frantic hammering of dead marines. Dudley
followed with the disastrous statement, that both
the King and the Government which had sent him
to Australia eagerly anticipated the day when the
Australian flag should be seen flying over Australian
warships in Australian waters. A slump in Anti-
Australianism followed, that might have been heard
at Circular Quay.
At various times the departing Governor-General
has been called on to jump severely upon “Liberals”
who have abused or slandered his Ministers in his
hearing, and he has come up to the scratch in no
uncertain fashion every time. After a long course
of Governors, State and 1 ederal, who, however they
comported themselves publicly, were invariably de-
lighted to hear Laborites damned in private, Dudley
came upon right-thinking Affluence in the nature of
a Suock, or Freak, or Calamity. It was Dudley’s
bad luck that, at the very time the well-to-do were
deploring the strange new manners and customs he
was introducing, Ed. VII. should die. That stopped
free food and drink, so far as Government Housers
were concerned, for an intolerably long period.
Society in Australia always libels its Governors.
Dudley has had no worse things said about him
by the members of our ancient nobility, and those
with whom they came in contact, than a'dozen others,
because, one way and another, he had annoyed
Society” more than any of his predecessors, the
scandalous talk concerning him was particularly loud
and bitter.
. No one believes the civil fiction that he is leaving
m order to superintend the education of his child-
ren. Indian Viceroys finish their terms without
dren. Indian Viceroys finish their terms without
hanging over the backs of their immature offspring
during lesson hours; so do Canadian Governor-
Generals. The fact is, Australia is. no place for
Governors who think differently from thtr section
which Higinbotham termed “our wealthy lower
orders.” The probability is that Dudley’s departure
is a step deliberately taken to avoid new charges
of arson, barratry and burglary with violence.
“Chloe” : The Commonwealth has the finest
chance a Government has ever had to start
an industry promising great profit, direct
and indirect, without jumping on the toes
of the legitimate private producer. A bold
scheme, carried out thoughtfully, and based
on scientific knowledge and practical experi-
ence, could be put in operation in the
Northern Territory 'at once, and with very
little expense. An area of a million acres
might be reserved in three or four sections,
and stocked with cattle, sheep and pigs in
small herds. Cultivation of suitable areas
would naturally follow. The plan would
entail the employment of anything up to
5000 workers. If these weren’t forthcoming
in Australia, suitable white men —agricul-
tural laborers —could be got from Europe.
If this scheme were adopted now, Australia
in three or four years’ time would not only
be drawing supplies of jute and other tropi-
cal goods from its own national sources, but
would also be raising live stock not only for
an immediate meat supply, but for the sup-
ply of the army and navy. A supply would
also be assured in war-time at something
less than the famine prices which otherwise
would have to be paid. And, above all, the
scheme would lead to the more speedy popu-
lating of the North, and that is the Common-
wealth’s most urgent duty. The North must
he occupied, and definite measures are
wanted. Government must take a decided
initiative. Words, words, words are simply
waste of time, and far too much time has
been wasted already.
“An Officer of the Old Guard” pursues a
controversy:—
I read with very great interest The Bulletin's
recent paragraph respecting the treatment meted out
by Headquarters Staff to certain militia or citizen
officers, and I can assert that the remarks faithfully
outlined what is happening to many others, more
particularly those who have attained senior rank.
The recent extraordinary decision of the Military
Board anent the retiring age, acquiesced in and ap-
proved of by a too trustful Minister, is a fair sample
of the rewards heaped by the present staff upon men
who have not only devoted a lifetime to military
duties, but large amounts of their private funds as
well; and unless some drastic changes are made the
officer of to-day can look forward to similiar honors
when his time arrives. Treatment like this would
not be tolerated in any other line of life, and the
shortage of officers, both in number and quality, is
not to be wondered at. The scant courtesy of a
short note to the affected officers ought not to have
been too much to expect; but as Headquarters doings
are always well under the limelight, the first inti-
mation given must be in the public press. This has
been done so frequently that it is undoubtedly only
another part of the scheme of petty annoyances and
pin pricks. Attention to minor matters makes things
run smoothly; but our organisation never stoops so
low as to have any regard for the feelings of indivi-
duals, 'particularly when they belong to the citizen
soldiery.
A few instances may be cited. A colonel of light
horse, after 25 years’ service as an officer, saw the
first intimation of his retirement in the daily press
whilst inspecting his regiment; another whilst in
camp with his regiment; another when attending a
school of instruction; a brigadier whilst travelling
at his own expense in Northern Australia to obtain
first-hand knowledge of the country. The present
Headquarters men are quite out of sympathy with
the citizen officer, and have virtually proclaimed a
vendetta, due without doubt to the fear that some
militia officers may be selected for senior commands.
How well they have succeeded may be gauged by
the following instances. In Victoria many com-
panies are commanded by second lieutenants of a few
months’ service, and in some regiments almost ali
the captains have gone on leave preparatory to retir-
ing ; in others, officers who have barely finished their
recruit course are commanding units.
The present Minister has been successfully hood-
winked. It is pitiable to observe how this truly
honest man has been lured into the conviction
that he is surrounded by a staff with but the single
purpose of aiding his straightforward intention of
making the Australian military service equal to any
in the world; whereas most of them are time-
servers, whose single purpose is to put themselves
in a barrow and wheel it for all they are worth.
A recent cable message reported a Britisli
Admiral as having stated that, “in 1920,
France, in the event of war, would be able
to watch the Mediterranean with its fleet.”
Whereupon the futile crowd which holds
that Australia, was mad when it ceased hir-
ing British ships to guard its coast remarked
that, with such an ally, the British navy
would indeed be invincible; and stress was
laid on the Commonwealth’s dementia in
mistrusting such a defender. But, at the
best, 1920 is nine years away, and a lot may
happen in nine years. Nine years ago the
Boer War was still raging, and it was con-
fidently asserted that the Boers, when once
they were beaten to a ~ standstill, would
never, never get another chance to hold up
their political heads. To-day they are
governing all South Africa. Nine years ago.
Japan was a mere Asiatic State which had
quite recently, after winning its war with
China, been made to give up the plunder,
and had its face slapped by France, Ger-
many, and Russia. It is not seven years
since Japan proved beyond all doubt —at the
Yalu —that its yellow soldiers could stand
Guns and Rails.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Field-Marshal Kitchener conquered the Dervishes
more with a railway line than with guns. He knew
the value of quick mobilisation. So in his recom-
mendations he advised the closest sympathy between
the military authorities and the transport ser-
vices.—S. M'. Herald, 16/3/’ll.
When the troop trains got to the border,
Oh! the General died of rage!
There was nothing but mad disorder,
On account of the break of gauge;
They were messing around the station —
So the terrible story runs —
When the day was lost for the nation,
For the want of the Southern guns.
The South Australians were half-way there,
The Victorian lads likewise;
And the New South Waters tore their hair.
As they sat on the Queensland ties;
It wasn’t a job of shifting wheat,
To the port that howled for it most;
’Twas hurrying troops our foes to beat,
Like the Devil around the coast.
The grim bush-riflemen lounged and swore,
In the lines where their horses grazed ;
Each train was met with a savage roar,
And the curses of men half-crazed ;
Squadron by squadron they packed them in—
Ev’ry grinning, triumphant crew,
And off they trundled amid a din:
{Well, Good-bye—and be d~~d to you!).
“Click-clack! Click-click !” was the jeer flung
back,
From the very last pair of wheels;
The loiterers d —d the changing track,
As they sat on their dusty heels;
The great fouled engines toiled slowly north,
To the edge of their own domain;
Then spewed their loads of Australian wrath,
And came thundering back again.
And the cursing loads ? They sat and swore,
On a border-line bare and brown;
The trains were late at each State back door,
For the “systems” had broken down.
They hadn’t been built for army corps—
Mixed samples of railway track —
So the soldiers smoked at State back doors,
Till the telegraph ticked “ Fall back!”
It’s five feet three, or it’s three feet six,
Or it’s four feet eight and a half;
The Traffic must do some wizard tricks
A,t a word from the General Staff,
With each State building narrow or wide
And reviling the Next Door Chap;—
The Fright who lives on the other side
Of the dotted line on the map.
When the troop trains got to the border,
Oh! the General died of rage!
There was nothing but mad disorder,
On account of the break of gauge;
They were messing around the station —
The ridiculous story runs —
When the day was lost to the nation,
For the vvant of the Southern guns.

The horse which, besides his other merits, is an
Australian industry, is threatened by the oil engine,
which is mainly a foreign product. Australia is thus in
process of losing one very profitable industry, and
having to pay through the nose because the sup-
planter is almost wholly of foreign origin. This is
one of the arguments put forward by the Invincible Motor
Construction Co., Ltd., in urging the Federal Parliament
to raise the tariff on oil engines. The co. doesn’t see why
any oil engine should be imported, as Australian skill and
enterprise are capable of turning out engines for any use,
on either sea or land, better than the imported article.
“ Invincible ” engines, of which hundreds are now in use,
have proved that fact; but it ought to be proven on a
larger scale—the whole industry should be “ Australian-
ised.” Why not help that ideal by getting an Australian
engine yourself l “ Invincible” engines are strong, eco-
nomical and reliable, and carry a Five Years' Guarantee.

Victoria’s Insolvency Judge Moule lately
spoke hot words to a delinquent whose estate
had been sequestrated. The assets totalled
55., which didn’t leave the trustee much for
expenses; so he wrote to the insolvent for
his books, papers, etc. Not getting any re-
ply he invited him to a personal interview,
and was no more successful. His Honor
was shocked at such contempt of the law,
and asked the wretched insolvent what he
meant by it, and why he shouldn’t be sent
to gaol. The insolvent pleaded that he
had intended no disrespect; he had, he ex-
plained, scraped together £5 and paid the
money to a solicitor to attend to the matter
for him. The explanation didn’t mollify the
Judge. He had a very good mind, he said,
to send the miscreant to gaol; and, anyhow,
he would go there if he couldn’t find £ll for
costs. The solicitor who allegedly took the
£5, and not only didn’t do any service, but
actually, according to the story told the
Court, landed his client on the doorstep of
the gaol, seems to have dropped right out
of the proceedings. Nobody appears to have
inquired whether the insolvent’s story was
true; and nobody breathed a word to the
effect that, if it was true —and it doesn’t
sound incredible —there ought to be some-
thing cold waiting for the gent. There are
countries where, if Costs neglected a client’s
interests in the way this insolvent alleged
that his had been neglected, the Courts
would order Costs to pay up the £ll. But
they are countries where the law isn’t re-
cognised as Licensed Robbery.

W. S. Macqueen, of Woollahra (N.S.W.)
Scotehbyterian Church, has given the no-
defence Wowser party another text to chew
over—“He that hath no sword let him sell
his garment and buy one.” Parson Mac-
queen addresses youths once a month,
and his last few remarks have been pam-
phletted under the title: “Sell your coat and
buy a sword.” War is horrible, says Mac-
queen, but there are some things more hor-
rible even than the clash of trained men.
Talking about the new Defence scheme he
says:—
If we fail to carry this thing through in the most
thorough and self-sacrificing and enlightened fashion,
the day may not be very far distant when we shall
have no country to defend, and should that dire
event happen, which may God forbid, the verdict of
history will be that a people who were not prepared
to defend so rich a heritage were unfit to occupy it.
And for the man in the front pew, with the
silk hat under the seat:
Passing resolutions at public meetings is a cheap
form of patriotism. The sooner we get down to the
personal aspect of it the better. Self-sacrifice in the
way of serving on a forlorn hope or undertaking
some dangerous public service we can understand and
would emulate. But self-sacrifice in submitting to
increased taxation has, in appearance, nothing speci-
ally heroic about it, and to submit to it cheerfully
may therefore, when all is said and done, be the
more trying form of heroism. It is in this form that
the present movement is going to make its appeal to
the great bulk of us. Shut out from active service
ourselves, we may yet show, by the generosity of our
provision for national defence, that we, too, are
shouldering the burden and doing it with enthusiasm.
And the man who can be enthusiastic over the pay
ment of taxes for the safeguarding of his country is
worthy of as much honor as the soldier who en-
dures the hardships of the campaign.
For once in a way The Bulletin rises in
its place and gives three cheers for the
cloth.

Professor Salmond, D.D. of the Otago
(M.L.) University, has just published a
thoughtful treatise on Prohibition, which he
classes as a blunder and an unwise and in-
adequate measure for dealing with the evils
of drunkenness. Says Salmond :
We shall never adjust our minds properly to the
problem of drunkenness till we more clearly recognise
that it is an integral part of the great social prob-
lem, and that it cannot be effectively dealt with
separately. It cannot be separated from the ques-
tions about poverty, unemployment, sweating, high
rents, the unearned increment, avaricious combines,
drainage, sanitation, fresh air, over-crowding, edu-
cation and recreation. Drunkenness is a symptom
of social disease and disorganisation. There are
distressing troubles of the body (such as severe
headaches or dropsy), which are not in themselves
diseases so much as indications that the organs of
the body are not working normally, and that the
physiological and chemical processes on which health
depends are no longer being carried out. A quack,
with his quack remedies, attacks the symptoms
directly; forcibly, and, for the time being, even
effectively driving them away; but he does not
cure, and shortly the patient is worse. So, also,
there is such a thing as political and legislative
quackery; and Prohibition is of that order, forcibly
driving away drunkenness, but never touching the
more hidden sources of it, as the headache powder
forcibly ejects a headache but laeves its secret
sources untouched, driving it away, but not curing
it away. We shall never cure intemperance by
drastic compulsory legislation so long as thousands
and tens of thousands are cold and hungry, can
scarce find work, and are ill-paid when they get it;
live in dirt and foul air, have no self-respect or in-
terest in their existence, have vacant minds and
dull hearts.
The pamphlet gibbets the bat-eyed scheme for
reform which is backed up by YVowserdom,
and its author adds to a rapidly-growing list
of warnings from scientific and philosophic
minds that iron legislation cannot be clamped
upon the common desires and passions of
humanity without revolt in the shape of
subterfuge, falsehood, and, in the case of al-
cohol, diseases produced and fostered by vile
substitutes for pure liquor.
+.
“N.Z.” puts his view:—.
The article on “Labor in Maoriland” (B. 9/3/’XX)
urges me to add a few remarks. The concern which
styles itself the M.L. Federation of Labor is com-
posed of most of the miners’ unions and the shearers’
union, together with a few individuals of the
socialism-in-our time type, whose policy is charac-
terised by The Bulletin as “vague and” unreliable.”
It is, however, not the strongest Labor body in
M.L., nor will it work with the big trade union
body affiliated with the Trades and Labor Council.
For' some considerable time past the Trades Councils
have been urging each trade in M.L. to federate all
kindred unions in order to form one big federation
with a central controlling body, and considerable
success has been achieved. The first conference
under the new constitution will take place at
Christchurch at Easter. The objective of the federa-
tion of trade unions is to secure the best possible
advantage for all classes of labor throughout Maori-
land, to maintain a spirit of fraternal sympathy with
the workers of all other countries, to uphold the
rights of all workers to a remuneration equivalent
to the full value of their labor power, and to affirm
the distinct identity of labor as a factor in the
field of politics. The affirming of Labor as a dis-
tinct factor in the field of politics has been pushed
pretty well, despite opposition; and the 1911
elections will see some Labor candidates out, while
1914 will see more out —and in. Anyway, although
The Bulletin may have cause for regret that a
section of Labor in M.L. is for the time under the
thumb of the sky-rocket and colored-light type of
leaders, yet it must be admitted that a great deal
has been done by the trade unions to bring them-
selves nearer the possession of an independent Labor
party, to the confusion of those WARD-worshippers
who' skite that “Liberalism” does away with any
such necessity.

“The Passing of the Third Floor Back,”
which was revived at the Palace (Sydney) on
Saturday, is not so much a play as a long string
of raw moral sausages, thrown over the footlights
lib. at a time. And there is nothing more de-
pressing than morality in the form of sausages.
Like immorality, morality should be served as
a truffle; both are delicacies. Observe the sus-
picions even of Merely Mary in the boarding house.
She announces the arrival of the Stranger to the
landlady, “and,” says she, “’e ain’t the usual
sort.” “Thank God for that!” says the hash-
lady. “Is he a gentleman?” “7 don’t know,”
replies Mary. She could smell sausages in the
limelight, and naturally had her doubts. Still,
the Stranger (Harry Plimmer) delivered his goods
effectively, and the audience seemed to appreciate
its share. Of the character work Mrs. Brough, as
the landlady, and S. A. Fitzgerald, as an elderly
bookie, showed most ability, although it was a
very well-balanced cast. Since seeing “ The Pass-
ing of the Third Floor Back ” The Bulletin has
felt that all is inanity and vexation of platitudes,
and observes with satisfaction that on Saturday
“Lover’s Lane ” will be produced.
#* * *
The multitude still crowds to “Via Wire-
less” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. It is natural
that the multitude should. The new play com-
bines thrill, sentiment and that dash of science
which the modern theatre-goer appreciates as
much in his drammer as he does ice in his long
drink.
#* * *
There is still not a word in the advts.
about “Our Miss Gibbs ” leaving her place at the
Royal (Sydney), but that is what often happens
—you hear from next-door that your invaluable
Mercenary Mary will shortly be giving
you notice. Melbourne, in this case, has captured
“ Miss Gibbs.” In return, however. Sydney will
get “John and the Beanstalk.” The vegetable
will sprout in time to catch the eye of the cousin
who comes down for the Easter Show ; and Miss
Gibbs will continue to break the crockery mean-
time.

“The Belle of Brittany” will sing her
swan song, so far as Sydney is concerned, at the
Criterion on Wednesday night next. The new
Clarke-Meynell attraction is Clyde Fitch’s “The
Woman in the Case,” due at the Cri. on April 1.
The dates between the outgoing Belle and the
incoming Woman will be filled by “The Grey
Kimona,” a musical comedy with words by D. H.
Souter, of the Cat; and music by F. Wynne-Jones,
of the Hyphen.
** * *
Florence Challis, who set this country
singing “ The Old Bull and Bush,” some years
ago, is back at Sydney Tivoli ; but this time she
does not appear to have brought any infectious
ditty with her. “ The Old Bull and Bush ” was a
melody which suggested good fellowship, a cool
cellar on a hot day, and plenty of beer. It re-
freshed and entertained many thousands of
non-teetotalers, and must have been a con-
tinual irritation to the meddlers who are always
trying to nail up the front, back and side doors of
pubs, but would die of indignation if the tolerant
beer-drinkers started to close up the fly-spotted
tannin-dens where cats (of both sexes) sip and plot.
Beforeshe’sthrough, Miss Challis will probably put
on the “ Bull and Bush ” again. Cooper and Lait,
in a new farce ; Alexander Prince, Lucia Collins,
the Pounds pair, and Baby Watson are amongst
the performers who supply good turns and are not
overshadowed by the “last nights” sign. Julian
Rose, now doing a farewell week, is billed to
depart on March 25, while Fakir Fasola will fade
off the premises on March 29. Roberts, the
approaching quick-changer, is H. Rickards’s next
novelty.

At the Glaciarium, that most attractive of
all local magnets, “The Sirens of the Surf,” is
drawing to a close. Only two more nights remain,
and then the poll will be counted and the most
beautiful Siren will depart homewards laden
with the prize of her beauty. “ The Gaumont
Graphic,” a summary of the world’s doings,
is followed by the tale of the “Cowboy’s
Vindication.” This is a film of the sort
that the noble Red Indian recently indignantly
protested against; but, judging by the way the
cowboy is performing, all protests have been
ignored. “’Military Gymnasts” show how the
weeds that enter the army are turned into
bevelled-edged athletes, and the film screams
loudly at the lazy Australian patriot, “Go
thou and do likewise.” But the brute won t.

Spencer’s Pictures, at Sydney Lyceum,
are growing harder to keep track of, as the
management has resorted to the practice of
changing the programme twice weekly, on
Mondays and Thursdays. _ The trail of the
foreign combine is beginning to affect Aus-
tralian picture-shows, and to produce a same-
ness that is calculated to depress trade.
For instance, this week a good portion of the pro-
gramme at both the big Sydney houses is practi-
cally the same, and, judging by appearances,
Australian picture-men will shortly have to
depend upon themselves for variety. At Spen-
cer’s, the special features are “Captain Starlight,’
done into pictures by Spencer’s own brilliant
operator and an Australian company —all that is
left of the Dampier combination. The chief of
the imported features is the “ Motor, Botor, and
Aeroplane.” These pictures are listed as “dra-
matic ” ; but the Aeroplane is prophetjc, and shows
the conditions under which piracy will be carried
on in 1920.

The Professional Musicians of Sydney
“smoked” their friends on Sunday evening at
their chambers in Rowe-street. The attend-
ance was absolutely too good, for the night
was a night of steam and moisture, when
starched collars melted to pulp. Nevertheless,
the enthusiasm of the musicians permeated the
audience. The orchestra, led by Lewis Hender-
son, rendered a fine number in the “ Mirella ”
overture of Gounod; and, under the b&ton of
Alfred Hill, the “Maori Lament Movement”
from his inspiring “Maori Symphony.” The
solo vocalists were Geo. Whitehead and Nelson
Illingworth. The former gave Tschaikowski’s
serenade from “Don Juan,” “Plaisir d’Amour ”
(Martini), and Kipling’s “On the Road to Man-
dalay.” Nelson Illingworth sang a Maori song,
composed by Alfred Hill, to a full orchestral
accompaniment. It was a noble composition,
well sung. As an encore, Mr. Illingworth sang a
dainty “poi” song to an accompaniment of
strings. Other items included a flute solo by
Robert Irvine, and a harp solo by that unique
performer, Torzillo.

The reappearance of G. S. Titheradge in
“Civil War” is promised by the Sydney Stage
Society for April 1 and 3at the Palace Theatre.
The cast for the performance includes such well
known stage persons as Miss Lily Titheradge,
MissHopeMayne and Mr. Leonard Willey. “Civil
War” is a comedy about Socialism, which, when
produced by the London Stage Society, aroused
much interest on the part of critics and audience.
The box-plan opens at Paling’s on March 27.

The Williamson panto, is under orders to
make its Easter encampment in Sydney, vice
“ Our Miss Gibbs,” transferred to Melbourne ; so
“The Beanstalk’s” nights and matinees at Her
Majesty’s are numbered. It passes out with the
present month. The braw Scottish mother of the
Giant-Killer, whose husband used to treat her
more like a friend than a wife, will soon be
gone from Melbourne’s midst; the natty princi-
pal boy must shortly cease to show her pearly
teeth at local audiences; the Pantzers are pre-
paring to fold up their strip of carpet and steal
silently away ; and after next week nothing will
remain of the Doherty Sisters save the soothing
allegation that a married man may still be happy
sometimes —if he is very careful. Everybody has
seen the panto; many will now hurry to see it
once more ere the pre-Easter arrangements come
to pass, A Juvenile Opera Go., supervised by
Jennie Brenan, will have an early April season
at her Majesty’s. The juveniles play “The
Geisha ” first and “ Floradora ” afterwards.

At the Princess’s the question of “Why
Men Love Women’’was to be dropped—if the
advt. spoke truly—on Tuesday of this week, and
the co. is now devoting itslast nights in Melbourne
to the indestructible drama of “East Lynne,” of
which this paper never speaks without tears on
its pink cheeks. The previous production of
“East Lynne” at the Princess’s happened after a
week of “ Macbeth,” when the change of bill was
more distressing than in the present instance.
Miss Frances Ross, on this occasion, has the
melancholy satisfaction of gazing at Little Willie’s
last moments through blue spectacles,

After the dolors of “East Lynne’’comes “A
Message from Mars ” at the Princess’s. Horace
Parker, in the person of Gregan McMahon, will
begin to be regenerated on Wednesday (29th).
Quite a Bland Holtian aspect was given to
the Maxwell revival of “Woman and Wine” at
the King’s by the conjunction of Walter Baker
and Styan in the characters they played of yore.
A sudden indisposition of Maxwell brought Baker
to the rescue. Walter is the hero who goes much
astray and gets providentially drunk at the time
when he ought to have been murdering the
Woman with the Marble Heart. Fortunately
the deed is accomplished in a picturesque manner
by a lady rival of the marble-hearted one, and the
drama ends happily. Styan is the distorted Cali-
ban who waits with homicidal intent, and reckons
that no murder is a complete success unless the
wrong person gets guillotined for it. There is comic
relief in “Woman and Wine.” Brown takes
Bland Holt’s place in this time-honored story of
bottle, gee-gee and sudden death; but Caliban
stands alone as a true humorist. You couldn’t
please Caliban better than by offering him a drink
of hot blood out of Yorick’s skull. If he saw the
Face at the Window he would want to kiss it.
On Caliban’s wickedness there are positively no
flies. Miss Holloway, Vera Remee, Mabel Rus-
sell, Nellie Bramley, Tom Cannam and others
assist Styan and Baker to keep the performance
up to the standard of the scenery, and a harem
skirt ballet strikes topical interest in a vital spot.

The Opera House bill developed some
more changes last Saturday. Leipzig, the three
W’s, Ethel Loftus, Harwood and Yetta appear
as before; whilst Miss Spark and the Football
Dogs are strangers to Melbourne, and the Colum-
bia Comedy Trio have, seemingly, just arrived
from distant climes. The three men sing re-
spectably, also their fooling has some points of
novelty, the tall basso and the small Lazarus of
the party being old types in a new setting.
** * *
“ The Bed Cross Seal ” was thrown on the
screen at the Melbourne Glaciarium last Satur-
day night. This picture is worthy of honorable
mention, for, quite apart from its sentimental
story, it depicts episodes in the treatment of
tuberculosis. Snapshots are given of an Ameri-
can hospital where poor patients are shown re-
ceiving the best of medical attention. Among
other films, that of the Hansom Cab Mystery
remains supreme. Melbourne people have taken
to this fabrication, because the situations of its
incidents make it look homely.
** * *
“ Captain Midnight ” tills most space on
the Melbourne Olympia programme. The film
deals with a gang of decorous ruffians, who some-
how seem to be amateurs in wickedness. Still,
you never can tell how Really Good a bad man
can be. Rupert Clarke tells a yarn about Power,
the bushranger. Power used to work for the
Clarkes, and after he had got his liberty he went
back to a Clarke place. Then the boys—Rupert in-
cluded —used to go down and get the old man
to yarn. Once they asked him whether he
was ever really frightened. He owned that he
was. He had stuck up a coach, and asked the
passengers for the usual little trifle to remember
them by. One was a hard nail, and didn’t like part-
ing. Power said : “ I will give you three minutes
to make up your mind.” Then Power began to
think. “ What’ll Ido with him if he hasn’t made
up his mind ? He expects, of course, that I’ll shoot
him. But I can’t shoot him ; I couldn’t shoot any-
body. So,” concluded Power, “ I prayed—prayed
hard that God would soften his heart. At the end
of 3min. I came round to him again. It was all
right. He handed me over his pocket-book. I
was saved.” This hasn’t much to do with Olympia
or Moonlight; still it shows that perhaps, after
all, the gentlemen who don’t look wicked enough
in the Olympian Moonlight film are as wicked as
they ought to be.

The returns from the Police Department
showing the number of cars registered in New
South Wales, place the Renault car first with a
good lead. This position which has been gained
by the Renault car is phenomenal, considering
that the supply of Renault cars has only been
available during the last three years, while the
supply of other makes has been available for
twice that length of time. This indicates that
at present the Renault is the most popular car in
N.S.W., and a verdict such as this is proof that,
although the Renault is the dearest car in the
first place, it is without doubt the cheapest in the
long run. Both the Federal and State Govern-
ments have purchased Renault cars in preference
to all others.*
“LUCKY DURHAM." AT
MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Kenneth Brampton as

* ‘ Lucky Durham, ’ ’
as expected, is doing
well enough at the
Royal, and might be
doing even better if
Wilson Barrett’s re-
spectable drama were
not intersected bv three
long waits, and if it
didn’t pause in action
to introduce an aged
sermon on the virtues
and vices of horse-
racing. A littie excess
of talk about the sin of
the father being visited
upon the mother and
scorned by their off
spring is permissible per-
haps ; but the incidental horse-speech, feebly de-
livered by a mild little girl, is rather trying.
John Durham will continue to write cheques for
large amounts until Thursday next. On Friday
night the season will conclude with one con-
secutive revival of “Struck Oil,” with Maggie
Moore to the fore.

At Adelaide . Tivoli, manager Marcus is
having very nearly a fresh deal, with the Ameri-
can dancers, the acrobatic Altons, and the juggling
Kavanaghs as star turns. The Royal is closed
for the moment. West’s pictures are relying
chiefly on snapshots of Adelaide, and the Empire
is starring a bushranging drama. These picture
houses have a bewildering way of altering their
weekly change-of-programme night to get ahead
of rivals. One house after another antedates its
evening, and presently all parties have rolled
backwards through a week, and are much where
they started. The Dandies are still going strong
in the Exhibition Gardens. Other items are a
big St. Patrick’s Day concert in the Exhibition
itself, and a single-handed elocutionary “Othello”
by Edward Reeves, at the Victoria Hall.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Lafayette ” (from the inside) : The first cinemato-
graph in Melbourne was shown at the Opera House in
18J6 by Oarl Hertz. Rickards must have bought the
machine and films at the end of his engagement, as they
remained and were leased to Philip Newbury for his
Tasmanian and country tour, starting out November,
1896. About October, 1896, a Frenchman named Sestier
arrived in Sydney with a Lumiere machine. Barnett, of
the Falk Studios, met him, and they started a show in
Pift-street, Sydney. They were taking about £7O a day ;
but had to break their season to fulfil a week’s engage-
ment with J. C. Williamson at the Princess’s, Melbourne.
They returned to Sydney to do no good. Jimmy
McMahon had got a machine and taken their stand. So
they were forced into the Lyceum Theatre, where they
lost all their winnings. The first pictures made in
Australia were taken at Flemington on Cup Day,
1896. They were very successful, the light being
splendid ; but there was no machine in Australia
to make the positive film, so the negatives went to Paris,
and the pictures were not shown here until June, 1897.
“The Lawn on Cup Day” was a funny film. In those
days the film was only 65ft. long, and ran for a minute
and a quarter. Sestier turned the handle, I steered the
people away from the front of the camera (everybody
wanted to stop and look into it), and Barnett “stage-
managed,” as he called it. He had got himself up in a
most conspicuous costume for the day. When the
machine started, he walked straight up with Mrs. Brough,
acting and talking for all he was worth ; dropped her,
raced back through the crowd, grabbed Mrs. Maesmore
Morris, marched her up, tore back, and repeated the per-
formance with the wife of a Melbourne sharebroker. So
three times in the minute and a quarter you saw the same
man march up to the camera with a different lady. The
next films made in Australia I took of the English Cricket
Team (Ranjitsinghi’s lot), partly in Melbourne and partly
in Sydney. These were an order from the Alhambra
people, London. The Australian Eleven coming off the
Sydney Cricket Ground to lunch was one of the finest films
for light and shade and quality generally that I ever saw.
The cinematograph the McMahons introduced was the
“ kinetoscope,” not showing films but small actual photo-
graphs. They showed it in connection with “The
Haunted Swing." Jimmy McMahon was actually
obsessed with the idea of enlarging them. He said to
me several times : “ If we could show the.... things in a
magic lantern ! ” In cinematograph work there was
quite a lull for a few years prior to the boom. You may
not know that the invention of the “cine,” usually
attributed to Edison, was really due to the work of a
Viennese photographer named Anschutz or Amshutz, the
inventor of the old “zoetrope.” Lumiere, of Paris, im-
proved on his work, making a machine which is im<
equalled to this day; but unfortunately adopted the
principle of one perforation of the film to each picture, as
was explained in a Lone Hand article on cinematography.
The next machines, the “ Joly ’’(French)and the Edison,
made four or six perforations to each picture, so as to
use a sprocket wheel to move the film. For some reason
(the magic name of Edison, I suppose) this caught on,
and nowadays all machines run the Edison perforation.
“Spotlight”: If Henry Arthur Jones made the state-
ment credited to him by Bert Levy (B. 16/3/11) about
Williamson, Garner and Musgrove purchasing “ The
Silver King ” right out for £5O, he has either a woefully
bad memory or a diddling accountant. The books of the
present J. O. Williamson management tell an entirely
different story. “ The Silver King,” as a matter of fact,
was secured by the triumvirate on a royalty basis, a sub-
stantial sum being paid in the first instance. For their
Australian rights Jones and Herman have drawn
thousands, and continue to get their royalty whenever
“ The Silver King” goes up. They had a dividend as late
as last October. “ The Silver King ” royalties were
arranged in a manner showing Jones to be far from
the financial slouch Levy makes him appear. He gets
the same from the small towns as from the metropolitan
cities, by which it will be seen that he heeded well the
Australian politician who already in 1882 was spouting
about “ the wonderful potentialities of this great and
glorious heritage.”
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: “Monkbarns” (B. 16/3/11)
recalls only a few of the Melbourne amateur actors of the
’so’s and ’6o’s, and leaves out such srood men as John
Edw’ards (the younger), “The Collingwood Chicken”
(S. H. Banks), Jack Massey, Mick Molony (brother
of Dr. Jim), and a score of others. John Edwards
was the best amateur comedian that ever appeared in
Melbourne. In such characters as Dr. Pangloss and Dr.
Ollapod, he was only excelled by that trained master of
his Art, William Hoskins. Sam Banks was the best
lago among amateurs, and much better than most
professionals. He made a very decent Shylock too.
Barry Sullivan complimented Banks on his lago, and
Mick Molony as well. John Edwards was an articled
clerk to John B. Bennett, the solicitor, who, on witnessing
a performance of Dr. Pangloss, sent for “Jack’’and de-
sired him to make his choice—law or stage. “You will
excel in either ; but it must be one or other,” said J. 8.8.
Ed wards,of course, stuck to the law, was admitted, got into
good practice, and entered Parliament for Collingwood,
having as colleagues Graham Berry and Charles Jardine
Don. Bohemianism killed him. 'With R. H. Horne
(“ Orion ”), James Smith (just dead at 90), and J. E.
Neild (not long dead at 84) he founded the Garrick Club.
“Melb”: We watch a triangular duel of leading men
and women. Roberts, Maxwell and Wingfield battle ;
likewise Miss Day, Miss Holloway and Miss Ross.
Roberts is the most intellectual actor, and with “Lucky
Durham,” has at the moment the only intellectual part.
So he cuts in first. Maxwell has all of what the French
call fougue— fire, impetus and momentum. He lacks
Baker’s voice; but Baker could not afford of late to
let go. Wingfield is, I presume, a scion of the house of
“The Hon.” L. Wingfield, who went on the London
stage as Minerva in the “Ixion” burlesque, with
Ada Cavendish as Venus, before she shone a 9 Lady
Clancarty and “The New Magdalen.” L. Wing-
field staged “ Much Ado About Nothing ” for
Brough and Bouci. at Melbourne Bijou. It was not
much of a go. Titheradge, as Benedick, looked too
much like Don Quixote. The present Wingfield in Mel-
bourne emulates the other as a rattling “ stager,” but I
object to the Kingston rasp in the voice, which some
London actors regard as a beauty. As for the ladies,
Beatrice Day is a delightful artist, and South Africa’s
first favorite. Beatrice Holloway stands alone in the
competition for notes of tenderness. The fact is a melo-
dramatic company needs two leading women, one of the
Holloway and the other of the Ross type. Frances Ross
excels just where Harrie Ireland does, in the strong
coloring. The pair of them were in the Bland Holt pro-
ductions, where Miss Ross was thrown away upon insipid
things. Unfortunately, the best part in these melo-
dramas is the worst, and plays against the audience.
“ 0.K.” : Consider these “ shilling dreadful ” plays from
Hingland, how they insult the intelligence of anyone who
has any intelligence to insult 1 You get a wedding scene
wherein the villain is supposed to marry a heavily-veiled
woman at the altar, under the impression that she is
somebody else. She throws up her veil and shows him
his shocking mistake, whereupon he curses his luck, and
the audience roars at his discomfiture, as though he
could be legally.tied by a parson to a woman who hadn’t
been named, and who isn’t going to be recorded as his
wife in the register. Or you get a marriage, solemnised
by a casual parson, between a heroine standing outside a
prison and her lover who sticks his hand between the
bars, no witnesses, save the parson, being present. The
lover has been committed to prison by the coroner, for the
wilful murder of a lady who is not really dead, but sleeping.
The victim is suffering from the poisoned tip of a dagger
that inflicted only “ a slight wound.” Within the space
of 24 hours the supposititious corpse has been inquested,
and the “ English doctors” have pronounced her dead ;
hence the rapid committal to prison of the hero, who is
to be tried for murder two days later. No post-mortem,
examination: no evidence of poisoning: no anything.
The English doctors pronounce her dead, and guess that
she died of the dagger that scratched her—which was, by
the way, her own little weapon. But a Hindu doctor
knows the secret of the poison, and provides a draught
which hastens the inquested lady’sreturn to consciousness.
And the “ comedy relief ”in plays of this kind ! It makes
no pretence of possibility, let alone probability. The
theatrical caterers can give no reason why a seeming de-
velopment of “ education ” in the masses should have
resulted in a palpable increase of unreasonableness in the
bellowdrama that appeals to them ; yet a lower quality
of bellowdrama certainly is consumed than was obtain-
able in any of the English-speaking countries 20 years
ago. Consumed is the word. The audiences eat the stuff
and ask for more.
“ Vic.” : The Bulletin picture of the Wowsers delight-
ing in the brass band playing in front of their own shop,
and disgusted with it in front of a secular show, is a
faithful likeness. For a number of Sundays the profes-
sional musicians’ grand orchestra played music of the
most superior class in Wirths’ Skating Rink. There was
a holy cry for this and similar shows to be quashed. Now
Edgar’s Mission has taken Spencer’s Olympia, hard by, on
Sunday nights, and a brass band outside plays lively
music, not in the least of a sacred order, to pull the
crowd. Being only dance music, and such like, it is far
inferior to the classic goods which were given by the
Professional Orchestra amid the groans of the pietists.
“ Mvee ” : The “ Madame Golda ” who has made a suc-
cessful d6but at the London Hippodrome (B. 16/3/11) is
the lady whom Sydney knows as Miss Goulder-Clarke.
She was a pupil of Amy Sherwin, and left for England
under the latter’s charge. Since then she has studied
under Marchesi, in Paris. MissG.-C. aimed at grand opera.
Probably she has found the music-hall more lucrative.
“Vulcan”: The Australian poverty-pointer’s chief ex-
cellence may be in his (or her) powers of mimicry, as
alleged by some recent B. correspondents—but there
are exceptions. F’rinstance, Addie Hine, the bright Aus-
tralian dancer, who footed herself into high favor under
Williamson’s management. Recently arrived in London,
she was snapped up by George Edwardes for a trio dance
in the “ Quaker Girl,” and the turn so “ caught on ” that
the management was hurriedly preparing for an addi-
tional supply in the first act. As a special favor, Miss
Hine was asked by Edwardes not to take lessons from a
Fogtown dancing master, “as it would spoil her present
distinctive style.” This should be a whole fowl in the
bonnet of Miss Jennie Brenan, the local foot-guider, who
taught the Australian all she knows.
“Hamer”: The actor’s life has some sad moments.
My friend Augustus Roarer confided to me in sombre
tones the story of one of them. Realising that he owed his
landlady much board, he had considered it wise to sweeten
her by a pass for the show—a precarious suburban affair.
When he arrived home after the performance, he found
his landlady waiting for him with a stern, cold aspect.
“ Mr. Roarer,” she said, “ I’ll thank you for your board.”
He began with a recital of the old excuses. “No more o’
that to me, Mr. Roarer,” she said, severely. “ Why, I
saw with my own eyes the man with the black moustache
hand you five pounds to-night!” It took Augustus
quite a long time to explain matters, and even then the
lady still regarded him with half an eye of suspicion.
“Rastus”: Amy Castles is feeling - some cold snaps in
Maoriland. At Wellington, where the show had been
boomed to the rafters, the hall wasn't nearly as full as it
might have heen, and it wasn’t any fuller next evening
owing, largely, to the remarks of the musical critic of
one of the local papers. At the second concert that
paper’s critic found the barricade up and a boycott in
full blast. Probably the managerial nerves had been
frayed to breaking point by a previous helping of hot
sand from a Dunedin paper, which said : “ As a matter of
fact, Miss Castles should be studying instead of being
heralded as 4 The Australian Jenny Lind.’ ”
“ Not-At-All ” : Henry A. Jones has at last produced a
decent successor to “ Mrs. Dane’s Defence.” It is “We
Can t Be As Bad As All That,” and has been played at the
Nazivoma Theatre, in N'York. The leading actress is
Katherine Kaeired, who played out here with Julius
Knight in 1908 as Miss Elbert Orton. She has scored a
success, having hit something peculiarly adapted to her
style. With regard to the play itself, Jones disclaimed
any intention of harpooning the British aristocracy;
nevertheless a leading N’Yark paper cites it as an “awful
warning of the evils attendant upon the existence of an
old aristocracy ” —though, when you come to think of it,
a. new aristocracy can make itself even more unpleasant
than an old one, and its manners are mostly worse.
“Haresfoot”Easy to trace the genesis of “Lucky
Durham.’’ The idea is taken from “Le Fils Naturel,” by
Dumas Fils. Bear in mind, too, Oscar Wilde’s profoundly
moral play, “The Woman of No Importance.” In that,
so well acted by Mrs. Brough and Titheradge, the
agonised mother fears lest her natural son should be cor-
rupted by his unnatural father. In “Le P&re Prodigue,”
by Dumas Fils, the steady, square-toed son is worried by
the gay doings of his racketty father. Charley Mathews,
when about 70, appeared in a version called “My Awful
Dad.” Yet he did not act the dad. He was the son ;
young Arthur Cecil was the giddy old father.
Ho. The theatrical exploitation of precocity always
makes me sad, and a recent visit to the kids’ pantomime
at the Melbourne King’s Theatre has made me sadder,
there are few things in this world that are quite so
wearisome as the stereotyped antics of an allegedly clever
infant. To hear kids expounding intricate matrimonial
japes, that are sufficiently dreary when perpetrated by an
adult, is an infliction which no law-abiding citizen should
be called upon to bear. Also, to one seated in the dress
circle, the voice of the average infant sounds like the
squeak of a sparrow upon the roof of a skyscraper. Apart
from the artistic futility of the juvenile performer, the
ethical side of the matter veers round and obtrudes itself.
It is appalling to think of the valuable years of kidhood
being wasted in learning the insane babble and fatuous
ditties which these youngsters mouth so glibly. It is
hkewise appalling to think of the waste of valuable kid.
There is a crying need for a Society for the Suppression
of Infant Songandance Artists. As a side line, the society
might be for the Discouragement of Serio-Chronics Over
the Age of Fifty.
“Snell”: The success of Wild, Willie and West at
Jtickards s Op. House demonstrates again the irresistible
appeal of bash. Wild, Willie and West put in about
15mm. hitting each other with bricks. For the sake of
variety, a biff in the midriff with a spade is introduced,
or Willie digs holes in Wild with a pick, what time West
is stifling under a bag of lime ; but never does the turn
get quite away from some grotesque aspect of human
agony. It is imbecile, barbarous, disgraceful—l nearly
laughed my ribs out at it. And, after all, it is correct
comedy, if very primitive. Nietzsche explains that the
transition from momentary fear into short-lived exhilar-
ation is the comic. It was thus that man the animal first
learned to laugh. He laughs still at the simulation of
brutality, and the laugh is not discreditable, since it is
the antithesis of his emotion in the presence of actual
pain.

“ Kobbi ” : The draw of the flicker show in the Back-
blocks is the picture of the township’s main street. The
word is passed round that the picture will be taken at,
say, 3 o’clock. The inhabitants turn out to a man,
woman and goat. The fat family butcher sets out from
his shop to pursue a bad debt; the local storekeeper, in
his Sunday clothes, rushes across the street, bound for
the post-office, on a twopenny stamp errand. The goats
are driven well from the foreground, and the deadbeat
at the pub is given sixpence to go into the back yard so
that his breath won't spoil the “ atmosphere.” At night,
how do they roll up to see the potted wonder!
“ R.T.” : It looks as if there were a con-
spiracy to suppress the Australian view in the
Sydney dailies. While as many as five letters to
the editor backing the State Fright policy have
been published in one issue of one daily, letters
opposing it have been refused publication. I
know. I’ve tried three papers, and failed to
reach print in each case, although on other sub-
jects I have had no difficulty. Anybody heard
when the Labor daily is due? Also, anybody
know the name of the party which is afraid of its
opponents’ arguments ?
Edmund Morey, nowadays living at Point
Lookout (Q.), owned Euston station, on the
Murray, when recently-deceased W. It. Randall
took the Mary Ann up that river in 1853. This
is what he has to say about it in his “Reminis-
cences of a Pioneer in New South Wales” :
Mr. Randall, who owned a small flour mill near Gawler-
town, put an engine into a strong lump of a boat, loaded
her with station supplies—principally flour—and slowly
made his way up stream, selling wherever a chance
offered. His voyage must have been very tedious, for
the boat could not make more than about four knots
against the stream, and when he passed my station,
Euston, he had travelled about 900 miles. How far up
he went I do not recall.
Some Artists and Some Others Who Should
Be Pursued with Bulldogs.
What becomes of all the unsold paintings in Aus-
tralia ? Are they destroyed after the last hope of
a buyer has wilted, or are they thrown into the
cupboard under the stairs for the dust to cover
and the spiders to roost on ? Year after year
thousands of canvases are added to the list of the
Great Unsold ; the “master” who ought to be a
pupil paints for a precarious living instead of get-
ting work ; the pupil who has as much artistic sense
as a Romney Marsh ewe paints because there is no
law to stop him (and her); the fairly good artist
and the good artist paint like desperate men (and
women), determined to teach the public to ap-
preciate them by sheer persistency ; the great
artist here everybody will please rise and bow.
It should be an offence punishable without the
option to exhibit Awful Pictures, just as it is to
produce Awful Smells or make Awful Noises, in
which case there would not be nearly so many
canvases now hanging at the Royal Art Society’s
“cabinet” Exhibition, which was opened at
Sydney this week. If a large percentage of them
were boiled down much good oil would be saved
for some useful purpose, such as covering the
waterholes in the Cotter channel to prevent mos-
quitoes breeding. Still, there are not so many
bad examples of raw student as at previous exhi-
bitions, for which the hanging committee is com-
mended. At the same time, it is urged to be an
even more vigorousexecutioneron thenextoccasion.
For the first time the grouping system has been
adopted, and is a vast improvement on the old
method of scatter, which panned out about one
good picture per five square yards. Now, the
good work can be found with a little persever-
ance, and the bad work passed without difficulty.
J. S. Watkins has the honor of receiving the
hall-mark of the trustees of the National
Gallery, and the satisfaction of collecting the
cash value of “The Musician”—a well-conceived
head in oils of violinist Josef Kretschmann.
It was the only Gallery purchase, and with
Dattilo-Rubbo’s “ Sandy ” (the head of a Scotch-
man) will probably receive more attention from
visitors than any other exhibits on the line. Both
are as good as anything of the kind done by
Watkins and D.-Rubbo ; but Watkins’s head—not
the one he wears—is a trifle greasy, and D.-Rubbo’s
head has a peculiar color effect which recalls the
taste of senna tea. The oils section is not
so good as the water-colors, but there are
a few out of the 95 framed results that deserve
the fair word of appreciation. James R. Jackson
shows flashes of his best brush, although he fails
to get the effect he sought in a night study of
Circular Quay, and the object of “Dreaming” is
like a speech by Alfred Deakin—much color and
little meaning. Evelyn Chapman goes a step up
for her painting of a portrait of Dattilo-Rnbbo and
the sketched head of a lion. Will Ashton still
retains his happy blues and sunny reds to
add charm to his harbor scenes; F. Meade-
Norton has the trick of light effects ; J. Salvana
has a sunset picture that is worth a good
deal more than the catalogued price; J. Muir
Auld exhibits nine in a bunch, the best of which
is a Cremorne sketch ; and Leslie H. Beer can
portray trees all right, thank you.
Coming to the water colors, W. Lister Lister
looms up with about a dozen lots of seascapes and
gumscapes and landscapes, all of them very
Lister, and some of them even more so. There
is the same natural curl of his breaking waves, the
same truth concerning some gum bark he has met;
but the subjects have become as monotonous as
the same girl every time or beer with every meal.
James A. Crisp’s kookaburras and magpies ap-
parently arrived just in time to supply a demand
for such fowl, for nearly all of them flew the
glad sign, “Sold.” Robert S. Clouston, a
recent arrival from Scotland, introduced him-
self with a portrait study of “Jamie” Burrns.
M.L.C., and the introduction will serve
to keep him in mind till next exhibition.
Anybody can have “The Blue Hat” and its lady
proprietor from J. A. Bennett for 30 guineas,
and without denying that the painting is worth
the price, the writer would rather spend the
money some other way. There is some good, con-
scientious work in the picture, but it is too stiff. It
represents nothing but a young woman wearing a
blue hat as if she had to do it for a crust.
Far more inspiring is W. M. Whitney’s fine study
of “ Morning at Narrabeen.” The fact that it is
28 guineas cheaper proves nothing, of course. It
is cheaper to buy a copy of the Psalms of David
than “Life’s Shop Window ” by Victoria Cross,
no matter what the price of the two may be. If
the Psalms cost less, so much the better. Of the
other water colorists, J. S. Watkins, Leslie H.
Beer, Edith Cusack, Albert H. Hanson and one
or two more stand clear of the rut. Justine Kong
Sing has improved in her miniature work, and in
the same glass C. O. A. Davidson is hereby
“shouted ”* a long tea for her small girl with the
happy expression.
Honors in black and white go to Norman
Carter (for a portrait of Acting-Justice Ferguson)
and James A. Crisp (a study of native birds).
Altogether, 53 people have contributed to the
show. Some of them deserve thanks, and even
sales. Others deserve encouragement. The rest
deserve to be pursued with seven bulldogs in the
prime of youth.
Both of the new K.O.’s in N. S. Wales
are old Sydney Grammar School boys, both are
Sydney University graduates, and both are dis-
tinguished Equity men. Leverrier, a native of
Sydney, spent his early years in France, but
returned to Sydney in 1877, and was for eight
months a student at Fort-street. Then he went
to Sydney Grammar School, matriculated in 1881,
and had a brilliant career at the University,
winning several scholarships and gold medals. He
is one of the very few men at the Bar who gradu-
ated in Science as well as Arts; and his
science training has been of the utmost value to
him in Patents work. The Other new silk-man,
G. E. Rich, is a son of the late Canon Rich. At
the University he distinguished himself in
classics; and while Leverrier specialised in
patents, his learned brother made company law
his own.
IN KESPONSE TO APPLAUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One time an actor roomed with me
At Beaumont Terrace, 53.
A splendid Romeo was he—
In fact, the greatest Romeo.
In confidence he told me so.
He was a tall and stately bloke.
He wouldn’t smile, he couldn’t joke—
His Art bore on him like a yoke.
Sublime, serene, and brave to see
Was his great, god-like vanitee.
Once, as we slept, by Heaven’s hap
There came, just o’er this splendid chap,
A long, terrific thunder clap.
I looked. Erect in garments slight,
The pro. was bowing left and right.

showed that Bovril added to a fixed diet, possesses a
body-building power equal to from 10 to 20 times the

SOCIETY
The other day an interesting legal tangle
was on exhibition at Casino (N.S.W.), during the
hearing of an appeal against a conviction for selling
soft drinks on Sunday. The Lord’s Day Act of
1832 intruded itself into the discussion, and the
Court consumed mixed precedents (which are
much worse than mixed drinks) all day. Finally,
the Judge decided that, if the refreshment-room
proprietor had produced evidence to prove that
his refusal to supply refreshments on Sunday
would have resulted in ill effects on the health of
customers, he would have upheld the appeal; as it
was, he dismissed it. Refreshment-room pro-
prietors who, desire Sunday trade will therefore
note that it is necessary to retain a medical man
on the premises, on the understanding, of course,
that he will certify that customers would have suf-
fered from appendicitis had they been denied the
stimulating gingerbeer.
MAKING A GLEAN BREAST OF IT.
P OLICEMAN: “Now, then, me man, what hov yez
to say for yourself?"
A DAM: “ Well, to tell you the honest truth, I
was afraid of the Bachelor Tax.”
Serious defects have become apparent in
the steering-gear of the British-made destroyer
Yarra, and the people who tell us that “of course
they can do that sort of thing better in the Old
Country ” have a tough job of explanation ahead
of them. A Sydney evening paper, which thinks
the chief office of a battle-fleet is to supply a
market for the adjacent shore-grocer, is in a par-
ticularly unfortunate position. Just before the
announcement was made about the Yarra,
this evening paper haughtily explained that the
building of the Warrego was only a mere job of
assembling carefully-marked parts, which had
been made by highly-skilled British workmen and
shipped out to this wild and ungrammatical land
at great expense. It offhandedly put the local
dock people in the same class as the bicycle
mechanic who laboriously screws the fragments of
an imported treadmill together at the rear of his
suburban shop. Moreover, it insinuated that the
local shipwrights would in all probability not be
able to advance beyond that stage for a long time.
Now, as they watch the Yarra zig-zagging pain-
fully about the sea, the Australian artisans may
take heart again—if indeed they ever lost it.
THE IRONY OF IT.
JOCKET ( bitterly ): “ And this is the horse the blighted owner told me not to win with too easily!"
It has come already. A London publisher
announces an “elementary text book, at half a
crown, on the principles of flying.
* * * *
There are points about a scheme intro-
duced the other day by Victoria's Chief Justice
Madden. He was conversing with a petty lar-
cenist who had just been convicted of this 30th
similar offence, and wound up by breezily inform-
ing him that “he had already served sentences
amounting to 35 months, but they did not seem
to have done him any good, so he would have to
serve them over again,” the penalty being 35
months accordingly. The thing, however, is to
apply the rule all round, and not merely half the
way round. Thus the importer with the faked
invoice, the lightweight baker and the adulterat-
ing milk vendor would be apt to take a more
serious view of things if they were fined the sum
of their previous fines ; wherefore Chief Justice
Madden is urged to consider his own rule when
that sort of malefactor comes up for correction.
Sitting as a Judge of the Victorian Court
of Mines, Judge Moule lately decided, after
deep thought, that bluestone is a mineral under
the Mines Act. It is in such matters that the
law shines like a lantern on a moonlit night.
Most people would rashly decide off-hand that
both bluestone and bluemetal are minerals, and
that is where they would go astray, the latter
being undoubtedly a weapon. Doubtless such
people would say thoughtlessly that coal is a
mineral, but coal was once a vegetable, and may
have been an animal before that; and no one can
say exactly when it left off being one thing and
became another. Even if the mining expert, who
knows all things, past, present and future, were
sure that bluestone was a mineral, it would not
necessarily be a mineral within the meaning of
the Victorian Mines Act. Gold, for instance,
isn’t a mineral within sight of that law. Most
people would cheerfully bet all they possess of it
that gold is as much a mineral as silver, bub they
would lose. Unfortunately the law doesn’t say
whether it is a vegetable or a pest or a mere beast
of prey. There are times whert many people
believe it to be a myth.
The result of the appeal to the Maries of
Victoria for “a trifle for the Queen ” is worthy of
the blessed Cause. The total amount collected
in shillings and coppers (some of the dear children
gave “browns” instead of “bobs”) is £220, so
the number of subscribers to the Coronation Gift
may be reckoned as 5000, more or less. And what
is the gift to be? What would be most likely to
delight the Gracious Lady and keep her always
in inind of the loyalty and love of her little
namesakes beyond the seas? The selection of the
souvenir is a touching answer to that question :
It has been decided that the gift shall take the form of
a handsome leather, tooled square book, measuring lOin.
x lOin. The pages will bear the names of all subscribers.
The Lady Mayoress has given permission for the volume,
when complete, to be on view in her room at the Town
Hall, so that those who conr.ributed may inspect it.
One supposes that all the Little Maries will file
into the Mayoress’s room, like the animals that
entered the Ark, and give their names, one at a
time, to an attendant in charge of the volume,
who will turn up each name like the custodian of
the electors’ roll at a polling-booth, and any
alleged Little Mary who proves to be a little im-
postor, and hasn’t got her name in the book, will
be thrown out on her impudence—though if she
says her name is Mary Smith it is almost certain
to be there all right. Poetic fancy can almost
picture the Queen, on wet afternoons, when she
can’t go out, poring over her beloved gift-book
and saying to the King: “What a number of
Smiths there must be in Victoria ! ” Then she
will point to one of the names and say : “Now
that strikes me as being a pretty fair-haired child
with dimples,” and George will say: “How
imaginative you are, my dear ; ” and all will be
happiness and sunshine.
In Westralia, where the other day a
Japanese was sentenced to 12 months’ imprison-
ment for deliberately shooting and killing a white
woman, a Judge has announced that “it is time
drunkenness ceased to be regarded as an excuse
for a crime.’’ Of course. We can’t crowd the
Book of Precedents with excuses. So the wise
Westralian Bench scores out the excuse “Being
drunk,” and writes in its place “ Being Japanese.”
’Enry Weedon, late Lud Mayor, suggests
in Melbourne the creation of a Free Laborers’
Union, “a union that will not tie workmen down
to the tyranny of other people.” ’Enry was ad-
dressing a body of employers, which explains the
reference to “other people.” No man is so
righteously wrathful about the tyranny of unions
as the boss robbed by the unions of the privilege
of tyrannising. It is a glorious idea, that of a free
laborers’ union—a proud, unfettered brotherhood,
hand in hand with the Employers’ Federation,
saying fervently: “Dear masters, we purpose
doing as we darn well please, if you please.”

“ Martin Luther ” : Talk of preparing to
defend ourselves against the Japs ! What are we
doing now? Japs—not the coolie class—work
coolie jobs on luggers at Broome, and some of the
Jap luggers know entrances and passages which
the Australian doesn’t know. They shouldn’t be
permitted to work boats at all. Japan is getting
more than oysters out of the Australian shell.
And if not now, until recently, at any rate, the
Japs had the gall to bring luggers into Broome
flying the Monkey flag ; and an Australian official
permitted it. *
“Mary Jane”: In reference to “Eddy-
son’s” objection to the use of the word doctor (B.
2/3/T1) there are others. What about “guard,”
“driver,” “cook,” “waiter” and -so on —not to
mention ‘ ‘ captain.” Has ‘ ‘ Eddyson ” never been
guilty of calling anyone by any of these names ?
How would he like, supposing his name was Miss
Ermyntrude Geraldine Arethusa Blobbs, and
people knew it, to be called “ Cook ” ? Moreover,
how would he like to be called “ Here !” or sum-
moned as “Hi !” I don’t mind him protesting
against the snobbery of “ Doctor ”-ing people;
but it is the same snobbery which results in
Ermyntrude being called “Cook”and thedomestic
servant being called Jane or Lily, and I want him
to kick impartially.

From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
A historic corner is now being cleared with a view
to setting back the alignment—the north corner
of George-street and Grosvenor-street, originally known
as Queen Charlotte’s Place, and almost opposite
Tim Bulletin's aviary. On that corner stood, in
the ’mid thirties, the main guard-house. To the
north was the house in which the Sydney Gazette
died. The house on the corner now going down was in
the early ’forties occupied as a drapery by John Hordern,
the first of that large family to leave the paternal roof in
King-street and strike out for himself. It was in this
shop, and with John Hordern, that plain Bill Dailey had
his first billet. Hordern Brothers, of Pitt-street, are sons
of this John Hordern.
The e7-perience of Staniforth Smith and
his friends in what the' papers call the “cannibal
country ” of Papua suggests that, as a man-eater,
the Papuan is as flagrant a false alarm as G. H.
Reid’s old tiger, Sosh. Here was a party whose
members, during the best part of four months,
were bushed among alleged head-hunters. They
were unarmed, and weak from lack of food. Yet
not a nigger attempted to injure them. The white
wanderersdon’tseem tohaveevenbeen “chyacked.”
Such “cannibals” as the hungry explorers did
meet fed them well—and with no ulterior mo-
tives either. Provided the Papuan traveller
avoids getting drowned or falling over a cliff, or
stealing the village’s belle, he is as safe, seemingly,
as one who paces a suburban back yard, and safer
than the citizen who attempts to negotiate a
crossing at the corner of Pitt and King streets
(Sydney) during the busy hours. It is to be hoped
that yarns concerning the bloody habits of the
Papuan savage will now suffer a slump.
Of a Melbourne Picture Market:—
Melbourne’s “ Permanent Picture Market,” at the
Guild Hall, struck some horribly bad weather in the
beginning ; nevertheless it has drawn a good few art
lovers thus far, and the final three weeks of the session
promise to have solid business results. Picture galleries-
in-ordinary are places where the Goths snort at the Art
they have never tried to understand, whilst the
artists sneer at the Goths, but at this show
the man in charge (L. Gill) treats every visitor as a possi-
ble buyer, whose ideas, if Goth-like, are open to modifica-
tion. If the customer can’t be persuaded to see what he
wants, the management will get it for him in the next
show. There are SOO-odd pictures, mostly pot-boilers, in
this first exhibition ; and the pet-boiler is the soul of
business, anyhow. A few of the works are large
and striking. At the far end of the room hangs
Naylor Gill’s extensive “Bush Fire, Gippsland,”
which has enough of the atmosphere of burning
timber to warm one’s imagination. An ambitious
picture of its kind is No. 7, “Rosy Morn,” by Robert
Canon, a disciple of Seheltema, who almost invariably
views the landscape as a browsing ground for cows.
Walter Anderson, Mrs. Gulliver, G, E. Hatton, J. Bea-
mont, Nicholls Anderson, J. Hennessy and Douglas
Richardson are considerably represented. Also S.
Handasyde, who deserves a buyer for (say) No. 318
and others of his low-priced landscapes. Miss Basker-
ville has a striking study of Purple Poppies in pastels
among her little lot; and Miss E, Walter is very
happy in several of her unpretentious pictures—notably
No. 110, a Tasmanian subject, and “ Near South Yarra
Bridge.” These are only trifles, but of such trifles the
life of Art is largely made. Miss M, B, George shows a
few pastels, of which “ Portrait of Miss Rogers” is quite
charming, and several water-color portraits in miniature.
One of Nellie Stewart was snapped up at once, and
carried away ; but there is anether of Nellie, and two of
Miss Bravton. A Child’s Head (152) is a sweet little thing.
Miss Bale’s portrait of herself has life in the eyes, but
no merits apart from the face. On the opposite
side of the room the old-fashioned oil paintings of J.
Sterling Moore are interesting here and there. One pic-
ture (No. 81, “ Crown Point ”) painted on the spot, shows
rocky outcrops which look like old castle ruins from a
distance. Another is “The Red Sands of Central Aus-
tralia,” seemingly sketched from a camel’s back. The
prim, print-like effect of Moore’s landscapes reminds
one of the illustrations in old-time books of
travel. A number of pictures from sundry pos-
sessors have been sent in for sale. There is John
Longstaff’s clever portrait of Charlie, the aboriginal
tracker; a good little bit of French landscape, by E. P.
Fox ; a characteristic Bondi study, by Streeton ; a couple
of small pictures by David Davies (one of then! already
sold), and a few by foreign artists, It costs sixpence to
go into the Guild Hall Art-market; hut a substantial pro-
gramme, with an outline map of Australia on the wrapper,
is thrown in.

“ Joynfc ” : The ancient mariners who have
been writing the interesting pars about fast trips
by “ wind-jammers ” in the old days have over-
looked the fact that in 1860 a Liverpool ship
named the Elizabeth Ann Bright, Captain Starkey,
left the Mersey on her maiden voyage on June
20 and arrived in Hobson’s Bay on August 10, a
total of 51 days from port to port. That was the
fastest sailing time ever made. The vessel’s arri val
created the greatest interest, as she was carrying
a detachment of the 40th Regiment, under Major
Brookes, bound for the Maori War, and their
unexpected arrival was of the utmost value to the
General commanding in Maoriland at the time.
The E. A. Bright was one of the flush-deck type

“ The Lyre ” in Mr. Beeby’s ear :

all good doers, thank God! My monthly salary is £l2
6s. Bd., of which the grocer, baker, butcher, draper-
ordinary and bargain-sale variety—claim about £ll 15s.
This used to leave me a comfortable 11s. Bd. for beer,
Bulletin, ’bacea, billiards, and other luxuries dear to the
male heart. But just recently the Department bobbed
up with a by-law which compels me to plank down 10s.
per month for school cleaning. If lam good I shall have
this refunded at the end of each half-year. But what
sort of a dash am I cutting in the meantime on Is. Bd.
per month ? Beer, Bulletin and billiards have gone, and
the pipe is running half-speed. Could not the Depart-
ment tack this cleaning fee on to our monthly cheque ?
In the interests of underfed teachers, will The Bulletin

“ Billy T.” r : How can the sex that has
appropriated all man’s privileges, and is now
pulling his leg with a view to commandeering his
pants, reconcile with such action its agitation for
a tax on bachelors? The world rings with clatter
about equality of the sexes, drowning the shrill
piping of the cieadse ; but woman, brazenly in-
consistent, fights persistently for a tax on
the unmarried man. What of a tax on spinsters,
in the blessed name of equality? There is
neither sense, sweetness nor religion in an
exclusive imposition for bachelors. Think of the
blighted, benighted suitor, rejected 10 times by
his beloved, being afflicted with “sorrow’s crown
of sorrow ” in the shape of an invidious bachelor
tdx. No State can justly tax a bachelor unless it
undertakes to provide the willing man with a wife,
the wife to be the woman he wants. Let the same
right be extended to spinsters, legalise sexual
selection, and clap a Single Tax on the non-
consenting party, male or female as the case
may be.
A LIGHT SLEEPER.
"Night-watchman — well, what are your qualifica-
tions?”
"Well, there's one thing, sir, the least noise
wakes me up."
Even the bogus* emigration agents in
Britain are brown aliens these times. A man at
Bristol, who took fees and deposits from a num-
ber of would-be emigrants (as much as £5O in
some cases), under pretence of providing them
with passages to Australia and billets when they
got there, is described as “a stout, colored per-
son, believed to be a West Indian.” Pretty soon
there will be no room even for a white spieler in
the Ereetrade country.
“ Mary McCommonwealth ” : In
common with the other Maries of the
Commonwealth, I am asked to con-
tribute alms in aid of Queen Mary.
I may say that George’s missus has
always had my complete sympathy,
and I sincerely trust that she will be
able to pull the legal possessor of her
charms through the trying ordeal which
awaits him. All the same, lam not
too keen on the presentation idea.
The Maries of Australia are a mighty
company, and I dare say if we all
pulled together and smiled sweetly,
we might squeeze even the price of a
Dreadnought out of our husbands and
male relatives. I don’t feel inclined
to try. By the time I have my new
harem skirt, with a hat to match, and
a few other trifles on which I
have set my heart, I’ll have made
quite a good enough haul. The
subs, of the Maries are, after all,
the contributions of the Johns and
Jims ; and the amount of secret male
swear that will go to aid the generous
Marian impulse might well make even a queen
wish that her name was Jemima.

“ Adelaide ” : “ Bumble Bee,” attempting
(B. 23/2/T1) to disparage the “whiteness” I
claimed for Adelaide, only makes it show up the
more clearly. It is not strange that in a city of
200,000 there should be one (1) Chinese laundry,
one (1) Chinese fruiterer, and one (1) Hindu with
half-caste children. I will cheerfully admit more
of each without damaging the general effect.
Meanwhile, the unsolicited testimonial of a recent
visitor, Victorian Minister for Agriculture
Graham, comes in appropriately : “ Europeans in
Adelaide have captured, or rather recaptured, the
market-gardening industry from the Chinese, and
it should be possible for white men to do thesame
in Melbourne.”

The young Marquis of Linlithgow, who is
coming out to Australia with his bride in June, is
remembered in Melbourne as a
bright, fair-hairpd lad, mounted on
a pony. That was when his
father was Governor of Victoria,
and was having a first experience
of the large inelegant house, with
an absurd tower to it, in which,
some years later, he was domiciled
for a second time during his short
reign as Governor-General. The
, hoy came out with his parents
the first time only, but
didn’t remain to the end
of their stay. He was
packed off to school
in England—at Eton
or somewhere and
Melbourne saw him
no more. The statue
of his father, which he
is to unveil, is to be
erected near the front
gates of Government
House grounds, so
when he pulls the
string the young man will
be surrounded by scenes of
his boyhooQ, in a sentimental
way of speaking. Perhaps
he’ll remember how, when he
had the measles or the mumps,
Dr. Fitzgerald greeted him
with, “ How are you this morn-
ing, my little man?" Where-
upon his somewhat crudely-
haughty mother interjected,
“Lord Hope, if you please!”
and the distinguished medical
man said “Oh dear!” How-
ever, the sin of Fitzgerald in
addressing a live lordling as a
“little man” was forgiven in due course
when Lady Hopetoun got a nasty fall in
the hunting field, and the surgeon was called upon
to mend her pretty little nose. He might have
repaid the noble Countess, as she then was (she's
a Dowager Marchioness or Marchioness Dowager
these times), by fixing up her nose on the bias,
but he made a beautiful job of her countenance
and reduced her to submission and gratitude. If
he had addressed her as “my good woman ”
she would have forgiven the familiarity for her
nose’s sake. The accident was subsequent to
the departure of Lord Hope-if-you-please, who is
about to re-visit Australia in the form of a
Marquis.

“ Palumpas ” : I enter my indignant
protest against the practice of sending out
State children to any dairy farms. These wards
of the State are already quite heavily handicapped
without being turned into tired teat-pullers. The
other day I picked up a boy of 11 and his sister of
eight on their way to school, and gave them a lift
for a mile and a half. It was 11 o’clock when I
landed them at the school. The boy told me that
he had 19 cows to milk, morning and evening.
He and his wee sister have to get up before
5 o’clock every morning, summer and winter.
“ Surely,” said I, “your small sister has not to
milk cows.” “ No, mister,” said the boy. “She
has to git up to ‘bail up’ the cows.” The teacher
at Dilatatum Creek told me that two of his pupils
(State children) were not allowed to take their
lunches to school, because they might play in the
dinner hour and so waste time ! They had to hurry
off at 12.30 to their home, where they did odd jobs
about the house and the dairy after a phenome-
nally frugal repast, and then rush back to school
at 2. It’s up to the N.S.W. Labor Government
to have an official inquiry held into this shockingly
sore state of affairs. I quite agree with the in-
spector of schools who says in his lectures:
“ There are only three fit places for our children,
viz., Happy Homes, Happy Schools, and Happy
Playspaces.” Before God, he’s right. And note,
State children are our children.
A COMPROMISE.
JEAN: “No, emphatically, I do not approve of
the harem skirt. The skirt, as it is, is almost
the only difference one can discover between
men and women nowadays."
JO: “And woman means to split the difference."
About 1397 people, on a rough calcula-
tion, drew The Bulletin’s attention to a Mel-
bourne obituary notice of the mother of 15
children, of whom the advt. said “She did her
best.” But only a few of the ribald commenta-
tors had a word to sav aboutpoor old fa-ther.

The scarcity of Mary Ann has hit the
Victorian Methodies in a strange place. They
have been running a State-subsidised Reforma-
tory for Girls 25 or 30 miles out of the city ; but
nowadays it really doesn’t matter whether the
girl is reformed or not—merely M.A.’s mistj-ess
will Jake her even though her sins be several little
onesi Sometimes, certainly, she refuses “ menial
domestic service,” and then spreads her influence
among the fact’ry ’ands. But, anyway, she isn’t
available as Methodist salvage ; so the home has
to be shut up for want of material.

“ Genung ” reports a St. Patrick’s Day
occurrence:
“A dirrty blaggard is Jabn Hogan,” said O’Flaherty of
the Harp of Erin Hotel. “ Him ! Him wid the pair uv
glasses always on his nose and a dozen uv thim under bis
grane waistcoat. Himl Lahst Froiday, just whin me
bar was full of the bhoys, and all was going beyutifully,
Donald McPhail stands outside and shouts, ‘To Hell
wid the Pope.’ And ev’ry wan of the bhoys goes out
wid a rush and a scatther and after Donald like beggary,
and he, being sober and a foine runner the same, leads
thim to Hogan’s pub, and thin they can’t find him any-
where. And the divil a wan of thim came hack to me
that night. But Jahn Hogan had a foine noight, he did,
that same, the dirrty blaggard.”
“ Liberal ” or Labor, they all seem tainted
with the importing craze in N. S. Wales. The
latest evidence of it is an advertisement offering
£750 a year for a Chief Inspector of Fisheries.
Applicants are notified that passage to the Ma
State will be paid, which seems the straight tip
that it isn’t expected Australia will produce the
fisherman, and, incidentally, that Frank Farnell’s
chance of re-appointment is sealed, boned and
cooked. When Johnson was imported from Bri-
tain and handed the job of Chief Commissioner of
Ma’s railways, over the heads of as good, or
better, local men, the howl that
went up from the Labor benches
was that of the ancient whango-
loposis mourning for the loss of its
first-born. Now the same crowd,
being in office and desiring the
best man possible for the care and
control of the local fishing grounds,
are apparently searching for him
thousands of miles away, where the
herring in tomato sauce and the
Yarmouth bloater have never even
heard of the Botany Bay prawn.
the Manning River oyster and the old-man
sehnapper on the coast. If somebody has to be
paid £750 a year to learn the job, what’s the
matter with teaching an Australian ?

“ Hamer ” : Now that thp Pure Foods
Act has won its way to the heart of the rabidest
Tory, I beg to initiate an agitation fora Pure Ads.
Act. As things are, an advertisement of a “ De-
sirable Gentleman’s Residence ” frequently in-
duces the house searcher to waste time and money
chasing a dwelling that, under a Pure Ads. Act,
would have been described thus :
f PO LET, if possible, an Undesirable Residence, con-
taining one room and eight half-rooms, blue
mould, poor drainage, bad smells, rats, cockroaches,
fleas and sundries. Every ancient and modern incon-
venience. Situated in the lowest part of Bunkum-
vi lie, facing the bone mills. Immoderate rent. Pre.
sent t enant claims to be going to the Coronation, but
is a liar.
Then there is the advt. designed to catch the eye
of the job-hungry, and attract him in competitive
shoals. It clamors for a “smart man, city exper-
ience”; and offers “good wages for suitable
man.” Under Pure Ads. legislation, the adver-
tiser, if he feared to publish the exact wages and
conditions offering, would have to indulge in some-
thing like this :
The smartest possible man for the least possible wages
wanted by city firm to do anything he is asked and
generally be a worm. No future prospects. Cheapness
the main consideration.
To the advertiser with an honest commodity or
job to olfer, a regulation compelling a statement
of the exact facts of the case would do no harm ;
while for the bogus advertiser there should be no
place in a civilised land.
TAKING IT EASY.
RESTFUL PARTY: “ Look here, old chap, you're
working too hard."
PORTER: “ Oh, I ain't workin’. This is me lunch

“J.F.”: Sydney Daily Telegraph on
Friday illustrated the Labor Bureau, in Princes-
street, and dubbed it “The first Methodist
chapel in Sydney, which is now used as a Day-
Labor Bureau, it was erected in 1817.” An old
building of stone stood on the site ; it was built in
1817 by one Sergeant Scott, who bought the
ground, sold a part, and paid for the little build-
ing with the proceeds. The present building is
quite a modern one.
THE SAINTS’ SUBSTITUTES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the Melbourne Methodist Conference was argu-
ing with P.M.G. Thomas about the wickedness of asking
telephone girls to work one Sunday in eight or provide a
substitute, the Rev. A. Stewart asked sternly : “ How is a
girl who gets a substitute to do her Sunday work, any
better than the substitute who does it?”
This reverend opens up a grim
And fearful view of sinfulness
That’s done on Sabbath days by him,
And Methodists as meek and prim,
Who really never seem to guess,
That, when they walk the gaslight in,
They share the sad lamplighter’s sin.
To one with Mr. Stewart’s views
The fact should readily appear
That reading all the Sunday’s news
In Monday’s papers is a ruse
To fix his sin on brothers dear.
Pale Sabbath-breakers contribute—
The reader sins by substitute 1
Those engine-drivers who for hire
Convey the saints to chapel pews,
The wretch who lights the baker’s fire
On Sunday night, the sinner dire
Who milks the cows for Monday brews,
The peeler on his beat —all these
Are Brother Stewart’s deputies.
Here in a wretched mundane state
We cannot dodge all wickedness;
And Reverend Stewart at the Gate
Will share the Sabbath-breaker’s fate,
And turn from Peter’s stern address:
VICTORIA.
“Go down ! You’re damned by sins a crew
Of other sinners sinned for you.”

This is one of the cos. that help to form the Mel-
bourne brewery combine; moreover, the combine
found use at first for the co.’s brewery premises. Its
share in the new concern—the Carlton and United
Breweries, Ltd.—is 72,500 shares. The divs. on
these shares, as shown by this co.’s accounts, have
been as follows: —
Jan., 1909 .. 3 p.c. p.a. ) July, 1910 .. 16 p.c. p.a.
July, 1909 .. Nil Jan., 1911 .. 8 „ „
Jan., 1910 .. 6 p.c. ~ |
The rent paid by the combine for the brewery
premises was £l5OO a year. Apparently other
arrangements have been made, and among the re-
serves now appears the item —“Commutation of
lease (suspense account), £8000.” This amount is
apparently owing by the combine. The capital of
the co. is £57,500, so a 6 per cent. div. on the
72,000 shares yields enough to pay a 74 per cent. div.
in this co., leaving anything that may be got from
the premises to the good. How the combine is get-
ting on this paper doesn’t know. It is a proprietary
co., and doesn’t make its affairs public. As to the
half-year for which no div. was paid, it is, however,
known that the nil in the table above was due to the
expenditure of a large sum in additions to plant.
Apart from brewery freehold and plant, and the in-
terest in the combine, the Foster Co. has very few
assets; the total is £12,779, mostly money owing
by the combine ; and on the other side the co. owes
£7719. The interest in the combine is really good-
will ; for the combine didn’t acquire any substantial
assets to speak of; it simply took over such assets—
breweries, etc. —-as it could profitably use in the busi-
ness, and pays rent for the bulk of them. The other
breweries are closed. The future of this co. depends
to a very great extent on the combine. The latter
might, ho doubt, be burst up by law; but it isn’t
likely. On the contrary* the Labor party, which is
most opposed to combines, is careful to say that it
only aims at those which prejudice the public.
This one could probably show quite easily that it is
in the public interest, inasmuch as its main purpose
was the elimination of the appalling waste which
previously prevented the investors getting a fair re-
turn on their money.

This is a co. with a first-rate record; and The
Bulletin finds itself every year turning over the
sheet to find out whether the concern’s dwelling-
place is really Mortgageland. This comparison shows
how some details have moved:—
1902. 1908. 1909. 1910.
Capital .. .. £42,580 £45,226 £45,482 £45,517
liabilities .. 33,561 34,095 28,657 24.279

Stock .. .. 6,374 10,619 12,984 10,103
Other assets .. 11,070 11,261 9,253 17,009
Compare the position of 1902 and 1910. The book
value of works (including freeholds and leaseholds)
'vas increased by £32,723; stocks are larger; and
other assets (mainly book debts and advances) are
larger. Yet liabilities have been actually reduced
£9282, and capital is practically the same —-only
£2637 has been got in. Further, fairly large sums
have been written off against depreciation; so that
actually a good deal more than the before-mentioned
£32,723 has been spent on works. , Put it this
way. In five years a profit of £73,322 has been
made, and all but £13,860 of it has gone back into
the business; the £13,860 is the aggregate of the
dividend in five years. It is a fine sample of self-
denial, applied to the building up of a very large
business. That it will continue always as profitable
as it has been in the past five years nobody, perhaps,
expects; for meat freezing and export is an erratic
business, even under the specially-suitable Maoriland
conditions. In addition to its meat-handling, by
the way, this co., as a side-line, supplies electric
light to the boroughs of Gore and Campbelltown.

Less Maintenance (4 months) during coal
strike .. .. ..£17,688
Income Tax arrears .. .. 226
17,914
Profit as above .. -. •• £3,910
But nothing much is to be gained by putting it that
way. Whatever the cause, the money went, and
£3910 was all that was left; and even then no-
thing is written off against depreciation. Cutting
up the result still further, we get this: —
Profit on cementation (Wallaroo) .. £1,432
Ditto (Moonta) .. .. .. 11,339
Sulphuric acid .. .. .. 4,103
Profit from mines and other sources 4,950
Total .. .. £21,824
Here, the. profit on cementation and from sulphuric
acid manufacture is no doubt slightly overstated,
while that from the mines and other sources is
slightly understated. There are a few small special
charges which ought to be divided between all the
branches, but which, in the foregoing, are thrown
entirely upon what is supposed to be the main
branch of the business —or the trunk, rather.
Cementation ’ is, in plain words, the leach-
ing of the oxidised copper from the old tailings
dumps. The metal is soluble in water, large quail,
tities of which are poured on to the old dumps and
allowed to soak through; and the metal carried
away in solution is precipitated in drains on iron
scraps. It is an extremely simple and inexpensive
process; and it has given great help to the co.
during the past eight or 10 years. It cannot, how-
ever, go on for ever. It is significant that,, at
Moonta, “the percentage of the precipitate obtained
was slightly lower than in previous years.” In the
previous vear almost the same thing was. said—.
‘‘The production of cement copper was slightly less
than last year.” And Moonta is the main source
of the cement-copper supply. The average costs for
some years past (costs, that is, of all copper, from
both mining and cementation) have been as follows:
1907 .. £73 17 9 I 1909 .. £53 3 11
190 S .. 54 16 8 | 1910 .. 54 11 2
Costs of cementation copper, including smelting,
etc., run to about £37 per ton. Costs of copper
won from mining, will, therefore, be considerably in
excess of £54 11s. 2d. And on to that has to be
added the sum spent in maintenance during the
strike at Newcastle. The profit on mining last
year was under £ 2 per ton of copper. _ Of course,
if the £17,914 spent during the strike is added to
the costs, there was an actual loss on mining of
over £lO,OOO.
Costs are tremendously high. This is mainly
due to the low grade of the ore, and the apparent
need for concentration; for, unfortunately, this isn’t
a practically self-smelting ore, like Mt. Lyell’s, and
the furnace charge has to be reduced by a preliminary
milling. That means not only expense, but loss. The
percentage of recovery at Wallaroo was 89 per cent.;
at Moonta, 77 per cent. After that there are slight
losses in the smelting. The losses in the mill-tailings
form the basis of the subsequent cementation or
leaching process. Some day, perhaps, the Wallaroo
and Moonta Co. may pluck up courage to ask some
distinguished copper metallurgist to come in, and,
just for manager Hancock’s satisfaction, report
whether the present processes are the correct ones.
As a matter of fact, that should most certainly have
been done five or six years ago, before the recent
large expenditure on plant. That expenditure has
been maintained until quite recently, with the result
that the co. wound up the year with an overdraft
(£5759). Not that that is a worry, though, be-
cause the copper, refined and in process of extraction,
was valued at £57,173.
As for reserves, the management never
demeans itself by mentioning such things. It may
be just as well: perhaps it doesn’t know.

There is some doubt about £675 of the total de-
scribed above as profits for the past half-year. A
guarantee fund of that amount drops into the bal-
ance-sheet ; and a guarantee fund may be almost
anything. If it is a fund provided, nominally or
otherwise, by the employees to guarantee the co.
against loss in case an officer backs the wrong horse
and then bolts for Callao it probably shouldn t be
counted as a reserve. Anyway, it isn’t usually
counted as one. But, even so, the half-year s profits
are extraordinary. The fact probably is that, having
increased their capital, the directors now feel justi-
fied in making the profit figures a bit larger. For,
as this paper has remarked many times, what a gas
co. makes and what it says it makes may be as
different as a politician’s promise and his perform-
ance. The simplest plan, if it wants to be modest
and not appear too luscious in the eyes of the tiger
of Sosh, is to pay for extensions out of revenue and
charge the total up to working expenses. A certain
amount of that is proper; the old plant is going to
rust and ruin all the time, and some new plant or
other assets ought to be provided to counterbalance
the decay. But the thing may be overdone, just as
it may be underdone. This co. has probably over-
done it. Still, though it may have accumulated
some invisible reserves in that way, the bulk of them
are visible. This shows their growth:—

Ten years ago the capital was £25,127. Then, the
co. being in a position to pay 15 per cent, on more
capital, the total was brought up to £45,000. Re-
cently £10,565 more was got in at a 100 per cent,
premium; so that on the new shares the 15 per cent,
div. is really 7% per cent. The capital wasn’t
actually wanted on this occasion either; on Dec. 31,
1909, the net liquid assets exceeded £22,000. This
is the brief record of 10 years’ work: —
1900. 1910.
Liquid assets.. ..£28,854 £57,095
Liabilities .. .. 2,134 4,200
Surplus .. .. £26,720 £52,895
Growth of surplus liquid assets .. £26,175
New capital and premiums ... 41,002
The difference between the last two items is £14,827.
The co. has, therefore, for 10 years made all its
plant and fixed-property additions out of revenue,
except to the extent of this £14,827. And what
those additions amount to may be partly judged by
the fact that in the last half of 1900 the revenue
was £10,197, whereas in the last half of 1910 it
was £19,822. Considerable new works are now in
progress; but, as shown above, the cash position is
very strong, and the co.’s long stocking isn’t at all
likely to be emptied. But it is a co. supplying a
public necessity, and.it is paying 15 per cent, (with
the reservation made above) ; and the prudent in-
vestor is bound to take those facts into account.

The amount written off is very small; but something
may be spent on repairs and renewals, and possibly
on extensions also. There is, however, no definite
trace of these things; probably even a Boy Scout
couldn’t follow the trail. Generally speaking, the
co. has been doing poorly, and the 12 per cent, ap-
pears to have been barely earned. Indeeed, if the
co. hasn’t spent more than is visible on renewals
and extensions, it looks as though the div. hasn’t
been earned. Even on the co.’s own showing, the
reserves are less now than they were at the end of
1906; and the only thing that would justify the
present div. is the expenditure of large, unmen-
tioned sums on works. Probably there have been
some additions, though they don’t appear to have
been extensive; anyway, in the past five years the
gas sales have moved up only in this gradual way;
July-Dee., 1905, £5397 ; July-Dee., 1910, £S7oS.
The cash position is fairly good;—
1905. 1910.
Liquid assets .. .. £9113 £6025
Liabilities .. .. 191 884
Surplus .. £8922 £5141
From that it will be seen that the co is drawing'
pretty heavily on its resources in order to pay for
new works; and if things don’t improve, the chances
of continuing the 12 per cent. div. are no better
than those of striking nuggets at 6000 ft.

The profits include the amounts added to deprecia-
tion and renewal funds; so the profits set out above
are not true profits. It is impossible to say what
the depreciation amounts to. The true profit is the
excess of revenue over working expenses, minus the
reduction in value of plant, etc., through wear and
tear and natural decay. Nobody knows exactly
what that depreciation is; therefore any statement
of profit in any gas co. must be a matter of esti-
mation only. In this way the directors have trans-
ferred all the surplus net revenue except £1252 to
the various renewal and depreciation funds. In other
words, they say that, after providing for deprecia-
tion and renewals, the co. earned only £2 in excess
of the dividend. But, as remarked above, a man-
agement can only estimate what depreciation there
has been. Therefore the statement of no one year’s
profit is exact. The only thing to do is to take
a general view of things; and, running the eye down
the profits column, it is clear that the directors re-
gard the situation as very much improved. The de-
tailed accounts support that view. Seven years ago
the sales of gas and residuals brought in a revenue
of £2554 for six months; for the past half-year,
£5721. The capital is the same now as it was then,
and liabilities haven’t grown much —they now
total only £1521. That is a wonderfully improved
showing. No doubt this co., like nearly every
other, is helped by the good times Australia is hav-
ing; but it is fairly clear that it has largely in-
creased the number of its customers and the area
of its service, so even when the tide turns the co.
should still be doing much better than it did, say,,
seven years ago.

The accounts now close at June and December, so
that the figures, in the last line are for eight months.
There have been other changes. For some years a
not very profitable electric light co. has been trying
to knock out a living from the Towers; and as from
July 1 this concern has been taken over by the Gas
Co. The purchase price was £6500, of which the
plant is supposed to represent £6OOO. On the past
half-year this electric light business shows a profit
of £2Bl, less depreciation. Depreciation for the
two departments is lumped; but, judging by the
amount written off compared with previous writ-
ings-off, more than this £2Bl was written off the
electric lighting plant. In that case there was a
net loss on the business; though probably it had to
stand some non-recurring expenses.. The co. had a
few hundreds in hand; for the rest of the purchase-
money it has had to go to the bank, where the over-
draft is now £4971. That accounts for the passing
of another dividend. No doubt it is a wise thing
to consolidate the lighting businesses. They ought to
belong to the municipality, of course; but, as they
don’t, and as the Towers is in no condition to stand
double administration expenses, one co. is better
than two. And it is impossible to truthfully say
anything cheerful about the field’s outlook.

The profits are stated net —that is, after writing off
varying amounts to cover depreciation. Trading
profit has moved this way: —

Jan - ., 1907 .. 4875 July, 1909 .. 5755

July, 1908 .. 5348 | Jan., 1911 .. 5009
It will be seen from the latter table, which shows
the results before anything is written off, that,
though the trading profit was larger in the past half-
year than in corresponding terms of preceding years,
the increase was small. Further, in view of the
fact that even the 10 per cent. div. had not been fully
earned during the previous two years, the directors
were not justified in paying away a fraction more
than 10 per cent, now, in spite of the slight increase
in profits, which may only be temporary. The co.
fortunately has Very fine reserves, built up in the
days of Ballarat’s prosperity—reserves which practi-
cally equal the paid capital. It is upon this past pros-
perity that the co. is living to-day. It may be main-
taining its plant, etc.; but it is doing practically
nothing to add to the visible reserves. It has to
meet competition in these latter days; as a result it
reduced the price of gas six months ago. It now
evidently asks us to believe that the reduction has
put money into its pocket, and thus justified an in-
crease of dividend. No doubt the directors have all
along wanted to sell for less and make more money,
but enemies—the consumers, probably—have held
them back! All the same, even though the co.
should still further reduce its price and thus still
further increase its profit, this paper won’t advise
the poor widow to put her mite into this co.’s shares
on the assumption that the 12 per cent, dividend
will go on for ever.

That is good. What is better, is that the overdraft
which was accumulated when the big alterations
were made to the premises five years ago, has now
entirely disappeared. This shows the splendid pro-
gress which was made in getting rid of the night-
mare :—■

That result has only been achieved by keeping the
brake down hard on divs.—so hard that the machine
stopped altogether for two or three years. But some-
thing else has to be done now. The co.’s property is
nearly all leasehold, with 60 years to run ; and though
doubtless a new lease may be granted 60 years hence,
the co. has no right to rely upon it. Thus, the
capital of £48,000 has to be earned in 60 years,
plus interest. Out of the profits, therefore, a sink-
ing fund must be provided. The most convenient
way would be to pay something by way of return of
capital, every two years or so, writing down the
leaseholds to correspond with the reduction of
capital. A true sinking fund would, of
course, accumulate in the co.’s hands, and would go
on accumulating until the 60 years had run out,
when the whole amount would be available for dis-
tribution ; but the other plan would no doubt suit
shareholders best. Certainly something of the sort
should be done.

If the law permits a co. to issue such balance-sheets
as this one has done, the Sydney Stock Exchange
should at least have a few words to say about it.
In the first place the co. started in leased premises
with a capital of £17,500, no less than £15,000 of
which was represented by nothing more tangible
than goodwill—that is the right to carry on busi-
ness in certain premises for a few years, provided
the Licensing people didn’t interfere. Clearly that
goodwill was at the best a fading asset. Yet not
a penny was written off it. As it happened, the
lease was renewed. And still not a penny was writ-
ten off. Then, once again, the lease was renewed,
This time —a little over two years ago—the landlord
said, “You must spend £5063 on my property.”
The co. had been so utterly improvident that it
had practically no liquid assets; so it had to raise
more capital. The total now stands at £21,000.
The present management is not responsible for past
mismanagement. But even the . present accounts are
very unsatisfactory. It is true that £337 is written
off this half-year. But it is written off “Lease, fur-
niture and improvements account.” It should not
be written off in a lump in that way. Furniture
should be kept separate from the paper assets; and
the writings off should be separate. The present
idea is evidently to make a half-yearly appropriation
sufficient to wipe out the bonus paid for the new
lease and the furniture and improvement items by
1930, when the lease ends. That is good as far as
it goes. In fact, if a sinking fund is to be estab-
lished, much less than £449 a year will suffice —
provided the actual money is invested and the in-
terest is added to the fund. But The Bulletin has
small hopes of this, because every available shilling
has hitherto been collared and divided. And even
this would leave the £15,000 of original goodwill
untouched. The position is just this. The co., with
35,000 shares, nominally of 15s. each and paid to
12s. (=£21,000), has—
Liabilities £1960
Liquid assets 962
Deficit .. .. £998
That was before the dividend was paid. All else it
possesses is a trifle of furniture, plus the right to
carry on business in the premises. If it lost its
license or if the business should become unprofitable
for any reason, it wouldn’t have enough realisable,
tangible assets to pay more than %d. or so per
share. Aarons’ lease may be as fruitful as Aaron’s
rod; but it is clear that everything depends on that
lease, and no dependence can be placed on anything
more than 19 years ahead. Within that period the
shareholder must not only get interest, but he must
get his capital back. The co. may get an extension
beyond that time. But, as recent experience shows,
if an extension is worth getting, the landlord will
see that it is worth paying for.
Christchurch (M.L.) has got itself excited
over the prospectus of the N.Z. Wholesale Club, Ltd.
The idea is to run a co-operative store on pretty
much the conventional lines. Apparently, however,
the co. doesn’t propose to give bonuses, as most co-
op. stores do; its idea is to sell at rock-bottom
prices. Big' bonuses undoubtedly attract customers,
whether they are paid by a store or by an insurance
office; and it is very doubtful whether low prices or
rates will have the same pull. The weak point in
the prospectus-argument is that members will get
goods at rock-bottom rates, and will also probably
see their £1 shares go to a premium of £2B or
£ 30. If the co. made a very big profit, shares
might go to a big premium; but the idea in this
case is to sell so cheap that there won’t be any big
profit. Certainly the non-shareholder may buy from
the stores; but even he is to be entitled to buy
at the rock-bottom rates on paying an annual fee
of 10s. Apart from that, there is no reason, given
good management, why the thing shouldn’t be a
success. There is big profit in trading; and if a
thousand families agree to get their goods from one
store, that store can obviously work at a very low
expense rate (since it doesn’t have to chase busi-
ness), and the bloated profits go back to the cus-
tomers who provide them. The theory is sound to
the core. The trouble is that often the management
isn’t.
* * * *
There is likely to be a move at Lloyd’s,
Burraga (N.S.W.), shortly. The co. has been hang-
ing off, hoping the Government would build a rail-
way. As it is pretty certain now that the Govern-
ment won’t, official opinion being against it, the
co. will proceed to make other arrangements for
getting in the indispensable fuel supply.

Australia, has born practically abandoned for. 11
years. A big bank has lately been in possession ,
but it wasn’t disposed to work the property itself,
and negotiations to let somebody else do it failed.
The Mines Department has now decided that some-
body must get work. #
Baker’s Creek, Hillgrove (N.S.W.), is the
same old market horse. No. 14 level has been driven
on a payable shoot of stone for 50ft. Average value
for a width of 9in. is over 4oz. per ton. Stoping
on this block of ground has been let on contract, and
the battery has made a start on the co.’s stone. On
the strength of payable stone in levels overhead, No.
11 and No. 12 are being driven north. Improvement
there is badly needed, because the stone in both
levels has been low-grade, and has only lately shown
a tendency to improve. Patches of antimony are
showing in the faces; and at Hillgrove that is always
a favorable sign.
* * * *
Cosmopolitan, Hillgrove, has resumed
driving and stoping at its lowest level, so the battery
return should improve. A reef 3ft. wide, prospect-
ing nearly loz. per ton, is tempting enough to con-
tinue the sink; but it is uncertain how far the
shoot of payable stone will run north and south of
the shaft. In the upper levels the shoot has been
very short.

Cobar Gladstone shares (N.S.W.). The south drive

terly carried a fairly strong make of copper ore of
good value. A winze sunk from the 210 ft. level has
also followed a few inches of good ore, which ap-
pears to be a separate vein from that showing on the
east side of the drive. The formation is in more
favorable country, and has widened out at the
southern end. Still not nearly enough development
has been done to test the real value of the show.
I’he outlook certainly is more hopeful; but that is
the most that can be said. The Gladstone has
hitherto produced only small veins of rich ore, and
the tonnage of prill ore sent to the Great Cobar has
consequently been very limited.
*■ * * *
At Wyalong (N.S.W.) drilling at 900 ft. is
well under way at Neeld’s, with a view to picking
up the' lost shoot. The lode is in hard granite
country. The result is being anxiously looked for-
ward to, as the gold output is still very low. The
only properties producing anything much are the
Keep-it-Dark, Barrier and Welcome Stranger—the
last-named being worked on tribute.
Gt. Boulder (W.A.) is now boring east
from the main shaft at 2800 ft., to see what it can
find between that point and the Lake View Consols
boundary. This hole is in an opposite direction to
the three which recently unearthed some more or
less rich values in Boulder Ivanhoe and Horseshoe
ground.

Two mining men of large tonnage, in the
persons of R. S. Black (general manager of the
Kalgurli) and Pierre Ledoux (director of Asso-
ciated Northern and travelling inspector for a Bel-
gian investment corporation, with an unpronounce-
able name), re-appeared in Kalgoorlie the
other day. Black has just returned from a visit to
the London directors, while Ledoux has come out
to see the mines in which his crowd is interested,
and also to have a look at Bullfinch.
* * ♦ *
South Kalgurli (W.A.) has got two cross-
cuts going at 1800 ft,, and it shouldn’t be long before
its value, if any, at that point is known. Street
talk about the Kalgurli lode passing into South
Kalgurli ground has helped to shove up the latter
co.’s shares a few pence, but it will be some con-
siderable distance, in depth, before the ore body in
question changes its present lodgings, if it ever
changes it at all.
* * * *
There are still hopes that Boulder No. 1
Co.’s hitherto disappointing St. George mine (W.A.)
may prove worth its salt. For the first 100 ft. or
so of sinking the outlook was rather pleasant, and it
was on account of the good values exposed above
this point that the co. bought the show. Below
100 ft., however, the shoot went wrong, and has been
a source of worry to the management ever since. Now
comes the news of 10ft. of 30dwt. ore and 4jfft. of
15dwt. stuff being exposed at 100 ft. and 300 ft. re-
spectively. Both are entirely new makes of stone,
and the one at 300 ft. is 350 ft. south of the other
body.

Humoring shareholders at the Bullfinch
East meeting, chairman Lewis Aarons said that he
could not for the life of him see how the State
Government came to hurriedly build a railway and
furnish a water supply unless it was certain that
there was more than one, mine in the district.
Feeble cheers from some of those who bought in at
par, greeted this remark, and more mild applause
followed the statement that the co. still had about
£30,000 left to pky up.
Ida H. (W.A.) has gone in for tin as a
side-line. A 400-acre property, located somewhere
in Northern Nigeria, has been acquired for 20,000
of the co.’s reserve shares, together with one-third
of any profits, and already early dividends are being
talked about in London in the usual wild, vague
way. Unfortunately it generally takes a long time
to get the strength of these out-of-the-way ventures,
and insiders have a chance to skip out if they
want to, and the public is left.
Kookynie Options Syndicate (W.A.) has
taken a call on the Bohemia and Francis Furness
South leases, near Marvel Loch, and it is probable
that an attempt will shortly be made to float the
two shows into one concern. Some rich stone is
stated to have been broken a week or two ago from
an Bft. reef at the 50ft. level of the Bohemia. The
public, however, should have nothing to do with any
Yilgarn property unless its value and prospects are
attested by some known mining man who has a
reputation at stake. The field is overrun with “ex-
perts,” who ought to be moved on under the vag-
rancy law.
* * * *
News comes from the West that mines
inspector Prabbe “thinks well” .of Cortis’s new find
at Golden Valley. A prospecting shaft sunk 12ft.
shows the quartz reef to have improved from a
few dwts. to' 40z., but whether it will maintain this
richness as it goes deeper is another matter. Most
quartz shows in the West go to pot at very shallow
depths, and it is fair to assume, until proved other-
wise, that Cortis’s will do the same. Meantime, the
option-holding syndicate, which happens to be a
Perth flotation, reckons that it has got hold of
another Bullfinch.
The Bulletin hears from the West that
Oroya-Black Range’s bottom level is in a low-grade
zone, and, as the reef must pass into the Sandstone
Development Co.’s block in a little deeper ground,
there isn’t much inducement to go on sinking.
Meanwhile the Development Co. is hurrying down
its shaft to pick up the underlay of the shoot, and
is already said to have got “something.” The Syd-
ney people at the back of the Sandstone have had
a hard, uphill struggle, and deserve a reward for
their steady, honest work.
* * * *
Youanme leases, over which Oroya-Black
Range and Oroya Exploration Cos. hold a working
option, is gradually being got ready for flotation.
So far results have been well up to the mark, if not
a good bit over it; but the option holders want to
see how the shoots shape at 300 ft. before putting the
property on the market. If things turn out well at
this depth it is doubtful if the mine will come be-
fore the public in the ordinary way. A certain
amount of scrip will probably be offered to share-
holders in the option-holding concerns at par, and,
as in the case of the Bullfinch, the public will not
be asked to participate except at a premium. Per-
haps, as also in the case of the Bullfinch, the public
will be, asked later still to subscribe for shares in
other shows in the district. This generous action on
the part of vendors of adjacent properties frequently
appeals to the unwary, who don’t stop to inquire
whether the other properties have any ore in them
or not.
* * * *
Last year Mararoa (W.A.) crushed
31,464 tons for a return of £58,482, including gold
recovered' from mill residues. Out of this revenue,
£40,000 was distributed in dividends. At the
present time the average length of payable ore in
the mine is 800 ft., the width 7ft., and the recover-
able value 335. 6d. per ton. Last half-year’s work
in the winze south from the No. 7 level has been
disappointing, but the manager thinks that the shoot
may possibly have been thrown into either the
footwall or the hanging wall of the winze. Develop-
ments in the north end of the property are stated
to have been “most satisfactory.”
Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) held its ad-
journed meeting on February 9, when the motion to
adopt the report and accounts, which was lost on a
show of hands at the previous gathering, was carried
by the overwhelming weight of proxies. Questioned
by disappointed, disgusted and disheartened share-
holders, Chairman Hooper alleged that the co.’s only
real difficulty—making the hundredth to date —was
to discover a process capable of treating properly
the refractory antirnonial ore found below the 100 ft.
level. Samples of the stuff had, he said, been sub-
mitted to various firms of treatment specialists, but
results had been disappointing. 8., M. and Co., who
boss the show, had got an 80 per cent, extraction,
with a possibility of improvement, by fine grinding,
rapid roasting, amalgamation, cyanidation and so
forth; but this process, the chairman added warily,
could only be definitely proved by the erection of
an experimental roasting plant, and, incidentally,
the forking out of more cash.
* * * *
The Kyarra group of leases at Meeka-
tharra has just been added to 8., M. and Co.’s
Westralian working options.
* * * *
Marvel Loch, the badly-handled Westra-
lian co. with a head-office in Melbourne, has come
to the reconstruction stage. Contributing share-
holders were so disgusted that 20,000 of the 50,000
on the register were thrown on the eo.’s hands;
holders reckoned a nasty trick was played on them
when a div. was declared on all shares, paids and
contribs., followed pretty closely by a call on the
contribs. The idea is to form a new co., 100,000
shares of 10s., paids getting share for share, paid to
2s. 6d., and contribs. share for share, paid to Is. The
20,000 forfeited contribs. will be offered pro rata
at Is. The property is well worth spending a few
thousands on, only it will have to be spent much
better than the old capital was. Management cer-
tainly seems in better hands nowadays.
Herman Landau, on the Australian working-
man, at the Associated Northern meeting in London:
“As chairman of the co. 1 have had criticisms sent
to me as to the advisability of allowing tributors to
work part of our property. Obviously those who
write in this strain fancy, that we are giving away
something, and that we ought to work the whole of
the property ourselvep; but those who know Aus-
tralia ‘and the labor conditions there would admit
that, working as we do, we save a good deal.” And
so on at great length. It certainly does pay the
Associated Northern to let parts of its almost worked-
out mine on tribute, and there is one big reason
for it —if the tributors get gold they have to whack
it with the c 0.," whereas, if they don’t make a do of
things, the co. .gets its ground prospected for no-
thing. One would think that Landau and his friends
would be well satisfied with this one-sided arrange-
ment, and would only be too eager to lie low and
say nothing; but apparently they are not.
Arthur Bristowe, sec. of the Derwent
Jack Option Syndicate, writes from Adelaide that
his co. isn’t even cataleptic. Early in the proceed-
ings John Stephenson, a man of considerable experi-
ence, was put in charge, and he has reported regu-
larly for the past two months. So far he hasn’t
found a bonanza. “Prospects” have, however, been
got. Present chief job is sinking a straight shaft.
The last report to hand said—“ The country
is good sinking. . . This part of the ; mine
is a network of lodes and formation, and
crosscutting at 100 ft. will, I feel sure, prove some
valuable ore shoots.*’
Uv* * . ' * * *
One of'the solidest ©f the tin centres of
North Queensland is Koorboora, 100 miles out from
Cairns on the ChillagOe Railway. Most of the mines
and the 10-head battery are owned by the Irvinebank
Mining Co., which doesn’t puff its shows too much,
wherefore little is known about them outside the
district. “Tony” Linedale —John Moffat’s lieu-
tenant—was prospecting for a short cut from Irvine-
bank to the copper region around Chillagoe about 20
years ago, when he found the first tin; and the
Moffat interest has been paramount ever since. Line-
dale’s, first find is reputed to have produced 400 tons
black tin down to water level (about 60ft.). Many
lean years followed the first harvest. Almost
every claim became unpayable at water level. Be-
sides the lower tin values, sulphides made treatment
more difficult and costly. Some of the lodes disap-
peared altogether. Ten years ago tin men were
agreed that the lodes did not go down. This idea
has, however, been knocked endwise within the last
two or three years. Various claims, which have been
tried systematically, have disgorged good bodies of
payable ore underfoot in the bottom levels (from
150 ft. to 200 ft.). One of the Irvinebank Co.’s mines
the Fairplay, located one of its lost shoots the same
week that the Tommy Burns was found; and, though
rarely mentioned, this claim has produced more tin
since then than the Burns. The Irvinebank Co.’s bat-
tery has been running continuously for about 11 years,
and has put through 51,419 tons stone for 3035 tons
concentrates; average value of stone, 5.9 per cent.
This included comparatively small quantities from
the Gilmore and Tommy Burns, and also a good deal
of wolfram ore from the co.’s own mine, the Neville,
which, up to about 1908, was (and perhaps still is)
the world’s record wolfram producer. These parcels
would no doubt send the percentage of concentrates
up, but they would be more than balanced by many
thousands of tons of surface stuff (spill from the
lodes), of a value of not more than iy 2 per cent.;
the latter has been put through to keep things going
while the mines were being developed below water
level. For 1910, during which the stone treated was
all tin-stone, and came almost exclusively from below
water level, the figures were: Crushed 4214 tons for
329 tons concentrates; average, 7.77 per cent. In-
cluding stream tin and a few parcels treated at
Irvinebank, the total for the 12 months was 410
tons, valued at £25,812.
* * * *
The once-noted King of the Ranges mine,
near Watsonville (Q.), seems to have come to its
own again. The Irvinebank Co. got it in a 20-acre
lease. The previous owners put in a tunnel 700 ft.;
but a dispute between local and Brisbane share-
holders led to smash up, and the looker-on got
the bone. The other day the new owners started a
crosscut at 600 ft. Almost at once they struck a
4in. leader, which promptly opened out to 20in of
rich ore.
* * * *
MacGregor, Cloncurry, is driving its 220 ft
level south. At 283 ft. from the shaft there was sft.
of 9 p.c. ore. A crosscut has been started a few feet
back from the face, for the MacGregor mine usuallv
carries several veins, as shown by the extensive cross-
cut at the 320 ft. level. There has always been an
idea that the shoot of ore would strengthen to the
south. North of the shaft a fairly good but not
extensive shoot of ore was developed. The co
may have to make calls to pay for a smelting plant’
or to provide railway connection.
* * # *
Brilliant Stockholm, Charters Towers, crushed
1045 tons for £3085. This is a monthly return
and should give enough profit to pay for the cutting
down and repair of the old shaft on the Brilliant
P.C. lease. This work should be completed in a few
weeks; but even after the shaft is repaired, a lot of
prospecting will have to be done to locate the Day
Dawn reef.
* * * *
East Mexican, Charters Towers, is keep-
ing five head of stampers going, and development is
being pushed on to open more ground for stoping
In cutting down the shaft to No. 6 level the reef is
showing 3ft. wide in places, and appears to be of
good quality. No. 5 is being extended further east
on two separate veins. The reef on the hanging wall
side will probably prove to be a continuation of the
loop shoot. Some years back the Day Dawn forma-
tion was struck in crosscutting at the 1018 ft. level
and was driven a few feet to the west, with indiffer-
ent results. It has been determined to drive east,
owing to the improvement shown in No. 5 in that
direction. The Mexican’s average of £5 9s 4d
from 150 tons was fairly good; still the mine has
yet to show what it can do on the much-larger ton-
nage that is necessary to give a decent return on
present prices.

Queensland Under-Sec. Macdonald has writ-
ten a review of the year’s mining for the March Govern-
ment Mining Journal. Production for the 12
months, £3,710,222, or £53,658 more than in 1909,
“Notwithstanding the persistent decline of the gold .
yield during the latter years of the decade, the total
annual output of minerals has increased from
£3,114,702 in 1901 to £3,709,151.” Copper has
saved the situation; and Mt. Morgan and Cloncurry
are the chief instruments. The output of the red
metal has moved along from £194,227 to £932,489.
Tin and coal are good seconds. The total output
was worth £322,822. Talking about the efforts to
find something in the immediate neighborhood out-
side Mt. Morgan, Mr. Macdonald says: “Of the
various more recent attempts to find some extension
of the Mt. Morgan deposit, that of the Mt. Morgan
Extension Company is the latest and the most per-
sistent. After sinking a shaft to a depth of 921 ft.,
boring from the bottom of the shaft was resorted to,
and continued until granite was met with at 2695 ft.
A second bore, after passing through fairly mineral-
ised quartzite to a depth of 350 ft., and thence to
420 ft. through heavy mineral, at 651 ft. bored into
limestone 50ft. thick, and at 900 ft. met bluish
quartz carrying mineral, which continued until at
1108 ft. granite was encountered, when the bore was
stopped.” But Mills, of Charters Towers, who is
providing all or most of the money, isn’t finished
yet. This is the most interesting bit of gold-pros-
pecting now in progress in the North. As to coal,
no doubt the most interesting prospecting is being
done by the Charley Co.—the concern which is
mostly Philip Charley and a little otner people. The
report, however, only mentions this enterprise, in
“the Charley smokeless steam-coal basin,” as it is
briefly spoken of. Probably more will be heard of it
when Charley has got the titles he wants for the
land he wants. He was in Brisbane recently, mak-
ing, it was hoped, final arrangements with the De-
partment. Of the high quality of the stuff there is
no doubt at all. Quantity is, of course, onlv esti-
mated ; but interested people think they are safe in
saying 100,000,000 tons. Practically the main, dif-
ference between this deposit and all others worked
in Australia is that the Charley beds are tilted, and
will have to be stoped.

Some flare headlines went into the melt-
ing pot last week over the tests, at the Ballarat
School of Mines, of stone from Black Horse Con-
solidated, Egerton (Vic.). It was said that 71b. of
copper found in the boxes had sickened the mercury.
All this was blazoned on the blackboard at the Stock
Exchange. Now Prof. Hart writes another story on
his School of Mines blackboard. Starting, he
whittled down the 71b. of copper to 7oz. Next he
declared that the quantity of copper obtained would
not sicken a garden hen that had the roup. Lastly,
he declared that the stone at the Black Horse con-
tained copper, and trotted out samples to prove to
all and sundry the reliability of his statements. So
one nail after another was driven into the coffin of
this “sickening” yarn, with a scientist’s dreary
accuracy. It is well that this has been done, for
the mystery about past crushings at the Black
Horse has thus been cleared up, to the relief of one
or two battered reputations. Hart’s story is borne
out by the fact that 8., M. and Co. had a look at
the old Black Horse for copper years back, but
hadn’t the pluck or the daring to put a copper into
it.
The Gippsland (Vic.) coppen-platinum
proposition is busy with its smelting equipment, part
of which is a water-jacket from the old Blinman
mine (S.A.). It is hoped to run a 50 per cent,
copper matte, which will collect small quantities of
silver, platinum and gold. Assays’ from the old
slag dump, left behind some 50 odd years ago, are
a gentle hint not to be too optimistic about future
recoveries. An ore carrying 3 per cent, copper, with
ldwt. of either gold or platinum per unit of base
metal, is not such an easy proposition. Great
Fitzrov (Q.) has not found 3 per cent, copper, with
3dwt. gold, a soft snap. As to material to work on,
in the deepest adit, at about 230 ft. from the top
of the hill, a crosscut has proved an ore body 43ft.
wide.

seis (Tas.) is still the biggest pro-
ducer of alluvial tin in the Commonwealth. Its
48 tons last month is well up to the average of
recent returns. It is doubtful what the profit will
be, partly because the tin market has a very uncer-
tain look, and because the tonnage of dirt to pro-
duce a ton of tin is larger than it used to be. The
gold dredging at the "Wallace properties (Vic.)
doesn’t help a heavy 600,000 share concern much;
91,500 cub. yards of dirt returned 3610 z. of gold, so
the average is under 4d. per yard—and. there are not
millions in that.
Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings of
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents,

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous , and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole re-volution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-
facturing rights of this filter.* [2

“A. William-Can u ” : All this chat about
Bush Hospitality, Lies, Beer, “Jimmie Panni-
kin,” Counter Lunches and so forth, reminds me
of Trypeville, a live little N.S. W. town a miieor
so West o’ Sunset. Its chief claim to distinction
rests on the dogged stand which the civic fathers
are making against counter-lunchers. One of the
duties of the local Long Beers Protection Board is
to see that every counter-lunch is adequately
poisoned. Pub-keepers convicted of having un-
poisoned lunch in their bars are fined heavily
for the first offence and gaoled for the second.
Arsenic is chiefly used, the reasons being (1) its
deceptive colorlessness and comparative absence of
taste, (2) its sure effect, (3) the agony it causes
the consumer. Several of the better-class pubs
go so far as to employ dummy lunchers, though
this is not required under the Act. In the Royal,
the other afternoon, I saw one of them call for a
beer, place it beside him untouched, and make as
though to consume one of the macabre-looking
gherkin sandwiches which lay in a lethal heap
on his left. Simultaneously, a furtive, chinless
person near by—one whose vast umbrella-like
bowler hat was impotent to conceal the walrus
moustache and boiled eyes of the born beer-
snatcher—reached out feverishly and swal-
lowed the potion. Shortly afterwards he fell
dead, amid loud cheers, and was swept out by the
bar-tender. The purloined intoxicant was, of
course, poisoned. The beneficial effects of Trype-
ville’s spirited policy are: (a) the wiping-out of
indigenous incorrigibles—your chronic counter-
luncher is not prolific ; consequently, if a goodly
number of him is exterminated the breed tends
to become extinct; (b) the warning-off of
lunchers from Sydney and suburbs. I learn on
what the S. M. Herald would describe as “ the
highest authority,” that since the new ordinances
came into operation " Jimmie Pannikin ” has not
attempted to sample the hospitality of any Trype-
ville drinkery. ■»

“ Koi Koi ” : Have seen some queer
burials, but the queerest have been in Papua.
Was working lately about a mile out of port on the
road to the cemetery, and saw seven in one day.
The first principal performer was attired in a loin
cloth, and tied to a stick, the stick being carried
by other natives. The other six principal per-
formers were clothed in nakedness, and were
carried the same way. They are tied to the stick
by four pieces of rope, fastened round the neck,
body, knees and ankles. It isn’t what you’d call
an attractive sight. Sometimes they use a kind
of litter, like the open box used for carrying
butcher’s meat. Asked once how the body was
lowered into the grave. “He fall flop,” said my
Papuan philosopher and friend.

“ Eddyson” : When the Pancake patch was
discovered at Crowbar, a stampede of miners
from other parts of Gippsland brought a tented
army of about 200 men to a district where men
had been exceedingly scarce for many years—so
scarce, indeed, that seven years after the death of
Wylie, Mrs Wylie was still a widow, though
Widow Wylie was “good property,” handsome
and hugable, and the possessor of about 1000 acres
of land that would grow swine if you planted pig-
weed. For seven years Mrs. Wylie had wasted
her sweetness on the desert heirs —a
few ungainly, bush-bred natives who
' hadn’t savee enough to get out after
the prize. Oh, what a difference in the
morning! Nine days after the rush to
Pancake, Coleman was proposing to Mrs.
Wylie in the kitchen, while McArthur
lingered in the parlor, Long on the verandah,
and Peters in the apple orchard each waiting
his turn. The stampede carried Mrs. Wylie
completely off her legs. She lost her head at
the same time, and in the confusion occasioned
by the excessive demand said “Yes” to five
different and distinct diggers. The trouble
that ensued almost called for the reading of
the Riot Act, and on the third Sunday
morning when Coleman, McArthur, Peters,
Long and Beckett were disputing furiously
in the widow’s garden, Hornsby offered his
services as ai bitrator, After conferring with
the men, he said: “Now, you fellows must
get back to camp, and behave yourselves, leaving
it to me to find a way out of the difficulty if I
can.” That evening Hornsby called the men to-
gether on the flat, and said : “It’s all right, boys.
I’ve found a way out. The widow’s going to
marry me!” As a result of the melee that fol-
lowed, Hornsby was unconscious for two days.
When he recovered Mrs. Wylie had married
Hamilton.
“ Gil Gunnia ” : As far as I know, Cape
York Peninsula (N.Q.) is the only Australian
address of the frigate bird, and I reckon it is
worth a trip up there to watch him going through
his aerial evolutions on a calm evening. One after
the other the birds climb up and up through space
until they appear as black stars against a blue
sky. Then, with a flash like a knife-stroke, they
drop towards the water. Their clothes are black,
except for a snow-white shirt-front. As to size, I
recently caught one which measured lift, from
tip to tip. They are most plentiful around the
cliffs of Cape Grenville, where they form colonies;
but I have seen them as far south as Princess
Charlotte Bay. In the breeding season the pouch
of the male bird becomes very distended and of a
brilliant red color. The lady is very coy, and
selects the most inaccessible crag for heiself and
mate and the nest where she lays her one solitary
white egg. I never met the white man who could
stomach the rank flavor of the eggs ; but brother
Binghi loosens up his belt when they are on the
menu.
“ M.E.A. ” : To resist the incursions of
black ants use castor oil and be happy. A piece of
tin tacked on each leg of a table and smeared with
the oil will promptly prevail upon the model for
the sluggard to find employment elsewhere. A
non-absorbent surface does not require a covering
of tin. In bush camps buckets of water, un-
covered tins of sugar, jam, etc., may be hung on
oiled wire hooks with impunity, and the contents
guaranteed under the Pure Foods Act.

“Kowhai”: Allow me to have another
dip into this Maori controversy. “Uncle Jim”
(B. 9/2/T1) thinks I don’t do Maori women’s
morality justice. Let
him think. I know
what I know. As for
“Jack” (B. same
date) let me tell him
the present-day
Maoris do not live
truer to nature than
whites. That is the
chief reason they are
dying off so rapidly.
It is the Maori who
has not been con-
taminated by contact
with alleged civil-
isation who is a
fine specimen of
humanity and the
posset sor of many
good moral points.
But he is veiy
scarce; in fact, he
is so scarce that be
is scarcely at all.
It is true, also, that
in the old days tne
natives were veiy
cleanly in their cook-
ing, even though
they did revel n
roast rat; but nowa-
days, in an imita-
tion of the modern
culinary methods,
they are otherwise.
I don’t propose to go
into detail, out of
consideration for
other people’s feel-
mgs; the fact of the same shin bone finding
its way back into the stew-pot from the dirty
paws of divers niggers speaks for itself. As for
the “ unbounded generosity” that “Jack ” speaks
about, it doesn’t cut any ice with me, though it
might with some people. Anybody who puts
the soft soap on Henare and “kids” to him
will get beer while Henare’s gilt holds out. But
I don’t see anything in that to make a song about.
Almost any mug will do that.

“ Culux ” : I’ve just given three encourag-
ing cheers for “Bromide” and his efforts to live
white in Queensland ; also, I write to refresh him
with the news that there are white spots in Wes-
tralia. Southern Cross, for instance, where lam
just now, is almost as white as the original driven
/now, Pubs, boarding-houses and restaurants are
all white. There are certainly a couple of steaka
da. oyst joints, but no Jap or Chow cooks ;
neither,is there a Jap or Chow laundry. If
“ Bromide” and a few more like him keep scrub-
bing at the stains in Bananaland they’ll be shifted
in time. I don’t know what time, but sometime
is better than notime.
“Shikari’s ” theory : “ Languid Lou” (B.
9/2/’11) appears to me to be on the right lay re
shade trees. As a result of years of experience in
India—where the climate can be hellish—l have
arrived at the conclusion that the deepest and
darkest trees are not necessarily the coolest to sit
under. The banyan, of which the Moreton Bay
fig is a species, gives a deep shade ; but the light-
foliaged tamarind a far more refreshing one. In
my view, the open nature of the latter's foliage
allows the radiating heat from the ground to
escape, while the thick tree confines it. The heat
of a tent, always oppressive, may be accounted for
by this theory. The tamarind is found in N.
Queensland. Mayhap Languid Lou ” has tried
it ?
* * * *
“Wang”: I see that “ Gyp ” is anxious
for a tip re the eradication of ants. Let her first
spread some honey or treacle about the ant-
infected area ; next she must take a pound or so of
crossbred wool, teasle it out well, lay it on the top of
the honeyed trap, and retire. Let her return in half
an hour with a bucket of hot water. The wool
will be found to be teeming with the black curße,
and consequently ripe for immersion in the steam-
ing fluid. Care must be taken to have the sweet
stuff well covered with the wool, and to press the
same down hard on it. Thus will the ants be
forced to enter the trap on their way to the feast
below. The above is effective with every kind of
ant, barring the termite and those of the bulldog
breed, which require either dynamite or sledge
hammers to wipe them off the earth.

Two Mufcdapilly (Q.) ox-conductors re-
cently wrote to the Ipswich show committee
offering to give an exhibition of the working of a
team of young bullocks at the next show. The
offer was accepted. The committee didn’t even
ask them to first send along the r vocabulary. It
knew that there is no sulphur among the ox-
eonductors now. Even Judkins could drive a
twentieth-centmy bullock.
“Waring” : Sorry I cannot join in the
debate re emus, but I know a few things about
their tony cousins, the ostriches. During the
laying period the hen bird is a constant sitter on
the eggs, but towards the end of the laying period
she begins to consider that it’s about time her
lord and master did a turn ; and, finally, when
the last egg has been deposited, she arises like a
mad Wowseress and drives him on to the nest.
One hour’s respite in the 24 is the most he can
thereafter hope for. The eggs are 12 in number :
and this is the extraordinary part of the business.
In Africa, where long distances may have to be
travelled by the birds to the nearest water, otdy
half the eggs are fertile. The mother breaks the
remainder, one by one, to feed the chicks; and
by the time the store is exhausted the youngsters
are strong enough to travel. But here in Aus-
tralia. bred with food and water alongside the
nest, the unfertility disappears. One pair of biids
at the Hawkesbury College have been watched
very carefully. The first season half the eggs wen-
unfertile ; next season eight fertile; next season
--which was ln,«t season—ordy two eggs failed to
hatch. A full brood of chicks is anticipated this
year. The unfertilitv is not fully explained. Some
breeders believe that the sagacious hen lavs un-
fertile eggs on purpose to feed her chicks, know-
ing that they would otherwise perish ; then, find-
ing out that there is no need to do it here, she
gradually drops the old habit.

THE RIEVER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The floods are out on the flats to-night—
Moaning ami maddened and wild and red,
Like a hooded serpent ready to smite.
Old Mitchell rears in his straitened bed.
Quick ! Lords of the cuttle and crops—your d'le !
Now the riever river takes toll, takes toll!
Hope for no harvest of eager hands,
The ripened ears and the swollen cribs,
The sludge bars tossed on the hungry’sands
That gape like a skeleton’s sundered ribs,
Tlie break and the blight and the far-flung shoal
Of the riever river take toll, take toll!
Tlie lean teams lagged at the furrow end,
And tlie plumed green army stood brave anon,
Now from mourning upland to river bend
Tlie whisper is hushed and the plumes are gone.
Only'the waters a death dirge roll
Where the riever river takes toll, takes toll.
Plunder, full plunder of horn and hoof,
Of tarn, green tresses and whitening bone,
And a darker tribute, deep housed aloof
Where the vespering pines on the hillside moan.
Man, beast and bird—and the twisted bole—
So tlie riever river takes 1011, takes toll.
The floods are out on the flats to-night!
Pray, if you dare to, and hold your breath !
For a craft rides seaward with never a light,
And the man at her wheel is the shape called Death.
Was it curlew or plover—or parting soul ?
Hush 1 Tne riever river takes toll, takes toll !

“Searchlight” : Eight years ago I was on
the Dorrigo (N.S.W.), tearing away at a selection.
It had been raining for weeks. None of your
drizzles; but day after day the rain came in
blinding sheets, and roared and thundered on the
roof. The creeks were all bankers, and the last flour
we had got from Bellingen
was beginning to look sick.
Our five or sick cows were
away in a paddock about a
mile down the creek, and
as it had been impossible
to move them for two days,
I made up my mind to
go and milk them in the
paddock. I took a couple
of buckets and started out.
On the way I had to go
through about a quarter of
a mile of scrub. I must
have struck that quarter-
mile in the midst of an
extra furious gust, for
scrub trees were falling
everywhere. However, I
got through, took the
milk front the cows, and
started back again. The
weather had become worse ;
the wind shook even the
fencing posts. As I came
across the clearing, the
whole mass of scrub giants
seemed to heave and rock.
I stood a few minutes hesi-
tating ; but that was no
use. I had to go through.
Have you ever felt the
ground rocking unde r
your feet, or been in the
scrub when the huge mon-
sters are falling—crashing
and crashing all around
you ? These scrub trees
are surface-rooters, and the
power of the storm in the
branches 100 ft. or more
from the ground caused the
whole surface of the
earth to quiver and tremble
as a boat does when struck by a heavy
sea. I had not gone Jar when a limb struck one
bucket from my hand, and I just sprang back in
time to avoid being crushed beneath the trunk. I
don’t mind telling you I made the fastest time I
ever recorded through that scrub. When I reached
the humpy again I was minus cans, milk and hat;
but was carrying scratches and rents where the
vines had torn me, and I had them with me for
weeks afterwards.
“Walt. K. Harris”: Apropos tile mention
(B. 26/1/T1) of Joseph Martinuzzi and others who
founded New Italy, in the Richmond River dis-
trict (N.S.W.), where they went in largely for
grape-growing. I struck this little settlement a
few weeks ago, just outside Lismore. Grape-
growing is still carried on, but on a very small
scale nowadays. The party established a small
eucalyptus-oil industry, but that, too, has now
practically died out. Still, Italy owes much to
that little industry ; for through it Martinuzzi
was able to convince compatriots in his fever-
stricken home of the value of the “gum,” which
is now very plentifully planted in southern Italy,
with most beneficial results.
“Boko”: I’ve been twice round Aus-
tralia and criss-crossed it by many an overland
trip ; but until lately, if anyone had told me that
there were teeth in the Commonwealth sharp and
powerful enough to burrow into a quandong nut,
I would have called him something that would
have made his indignation stand on end and'
sparkle like an electric coil. I was poking about
looking for camels away in the N.E. of Lake Dis-
appointment, when I noticed numbers of quan-
dong shells with holes in them and the kernels
extracted. Beside the newly burgled nuts were
rat tracks, and my suspicions as to the identity
of the burglars were confirmed after a wonyi with
the niggers. For the benefit of those not
acquainted with the safe-proof qualities of the
quandongs it may be accurately stated that it
takes an industrious boy the best part of a day
with a tile to make a basket-shape front One of the
shells.
“GilG.”: In the Northern Territory I
have repeatedly found myself barracking for black
against white, and hoping fervent y that the for-
mer would prevail. Many a time have I cheered
heartily as the niggers clashed with the whites
and drove them pell-mell to their homes. Ihe

will withstand their onslaught are the bloodwood,

“ Marloo ” : Father Casey, of the North
Coast, was. a great horse-fancier. If anything
could divert his attention front his flock it was a
race ; and he never failed to rope in a prize or
two at the shows. While “ visiting,” he called at
Con O’Neill’s, and when he was leaving he men-
tioned a serious matter to Con. This is how the
talk went, as Con reported it afterwards :
His Rev. : I’ll be round here again in a couple of
months, Con. Now, you choose a docile, even-paced
woman, and be ready for me to marry you. This is no
way tor a man to be living. It’s disgraceful.”
Con : “ I agree with you, Father ; but it’s hard to get a
suitable woman.”
His Rev. : “What about the little widdy who keeps
the post office ? ”
Con : “ Yairs, she’d be all right, but she’s lame.”
His Rev. : “Dame! Be hanged wid yer ! Sure, is it a
racer you’re wantin’?”
“ Stickpicker I have had under observa-
tion for the last four weeks a wasp atid a large
black and white spider, living in close and amica-
ble relationship. They have a joint domicile in a
crack in the verandah board, and the wasp, evi-
dently a firm believer in the sanctity of the home,
fiercely resents any attempt at interference. In
addition to being chueker-out-in-chief. the wasp
acts as providore, and rarely returns from a
foraging expedition without something in the kit.
The spider is in some way incapacitated, or else
he gets inked occasionally or oftener at the Cob-
web Hotel, for I have noticed his partner dragging
him home either very weak or very sozzled. I’ve
got a suspicion, too, that the wasp is no lady.

“Vulcan”: Heaven only knows where
electricity will end ! According to ’Frisco
papers, one Professor Wentworth, of Los Gatos
(Cal.), has been applying the mysterious “juice”
to the fecundity of sheep with marvellous results.
A 2000-flock was divided ; one-half was left in the
ordinary runs, while the other half was placed in
a field over which ran the power wires of the
Great Western Power Co. At the end of the
season, while in the ordinary field the average was?
a little less than one lamb per ewe, in the electric-
ally-influenced area the ewes achieved an average
of over two lambs. Similar differen'cfes resulted in
the fleece; the electrified muttons panned out 20
per cent, heavier overcoats. Now, the fields are to
lie put under wheat, and the power wires are to
be given a chance to show what they can do with
that substance.
“A. Borig” : The loyalty of the average
cow man is sublime. Had a talk with one, the
other day, whose neighbor has a large family of
girls. Sez he : “ Bill’s got the lucky of it to have
no boys!” “How’s that?” sez I. He turned
the light on. “Once a year this cussed Labor
Government ’ll take the boys away from the
milkin’ for three weeks or a month to drill ’em
and spoil ’em. But with girls—why, you get
their work all the year.” Poor little maids!
Can’t we devise some scheme to give them a
month free from the curse of the cow ?

MUSHROOMS IN THE MORNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She met him on the mat before the morning stars had
set;
She met him in the morning, oh, so early ;
The stars were in the sky, for it was scarcely sunrise
yet—
A moon or two still shone out, pale and pearly ;
And she asked the same old question, and her voice was
cold as stone,
Her quivering nostril showed her utter scorning ;
But Henry answered boldly, with reproaches in his tone,
“ I been out gatli’ring mush rooms! i in z’ morning ! ”
Hi s attitude was sloping and his hat was on his ear ;
He suffered from a bunch of strange emotions ;
The perfume on his person was—well, nothing if not beer,
With p’r’aps the faintest dash of other lotions,
And so she scanned, incredulous, that, early-morning
scene
(Torn newspapers her top knot were adorning);
But Henry just repeated, with some emphasis “ Doreen,
I been out afsher musliroomsh in z’ morning-! ”

THE DEATH OF TOTTIE HIGGINS.
There was gloom among the neighbors in the alley
When they consigned poor Tottie Higgins to the clay,
Saddened by her death her coster lover
Joined a ship and from Victoria sailed away ;
She was mourned by all the neighbors in the alley,
A sweeter creature never walked the earth,
Both pretty and charming in her manner
Though she never came of high ancestral birth ;
When the white plumed hearse drew up in the alley
Tears did dim the roughish neighbor s eyes,
And the little children muttered in their sorrow
Poor Tottie is an angel in the skies.

WILLIE WATT PAINTS A HORRIBLE PICTURE.
If the members of the Australian Labor parties and caucus and conferences had not written their pledged faith in Socialism, he would trust them to handle only the' great
monopolies of Australia. But they dare not stop there. If reluctant themselves, the legions behind them would push them forward. Then what would happen? By the insertion,
in the Constitution of the words in this referendum they would open a wide track through which would drive the chariot of the revolution. — Willie watt. Treasurer of Victoria.


PILGRIM AUSTRALIA MEETS STATE FRIGHTS.
“‘To-morrow,’ said they, ‘we will, if the day be clear, show you the Delectable Mountains.’ But now poor Christian was hard put to it; for he espied a foul
Fiend coming to meet him; his name is Apollyon. The monster was hideous to behold. APOL. : ‘I perceive thou art one of my subjects; for all that country is
mine, and lam the prince and god of it. How is it then thou hast run away? I would strike thee to the ground.’ OHR. : ‘When I was come to years I did as
other considerate persons do, look out, if perhaps I might mend myself.’ APOL. : ‘Prepare thyself to die; for I swear by my infernal den thou shalt go no farther.’
Then did Christian draw... and Christian saw him no more. No man can imagine what yelling and roaring Apollyon made all the time of the fight.”

“Barak” : An Australian well known in
the big world of science, but hardly heard of in
his own country, is H. J. Grayson, who conceals
himself behind the title “Assistant Demonstrator
of Petrology” at Melbourne University. Per-
haps he is best known for the marvellous
“ gratings ” he rules —parallel lines on glass that
are the necessity of expert microscopists, and
have a hundred scientific uses. A recent British
Commission, engaged in some extraordinarily
exact measurements, picked Grayson out as the
best man procurable to supply the “gratings ’
which were necessary for the job it had in hand.
The Rev. Gr. C. Miln, of yore,
the prosperous Yankee parson who
abandoned the pulpit for the stage
and conducted a brief Shak-
spearian revival in Australia, was
not nearly so interesting a figure
as the Rev. John Costelloe of
to day. Old stagers remember
‘‘.Tack’’ Costelloe as one of the
most capable and painstaking of
native-born actors. He was a
member of BandmAnn’s no. what
time that rampageous German
was touring the country. But
the Church always had attrac-
tions for Costelloe. When
he had made up his
mind to try his luck in
England, and could
see no hope of saving
money out of a pre-
carious salary, he got a
billet as verger at St.
Peter’s, East Mel-
bourne, and in the
gaberdine of verger he
served bis apprenticeship
to the Word, as it were.
Having saved the needful
be went to Britain and
earned his bread, plus butter,
as a provincial mummer.
Then he went to America, and
fell in with one Bentley (not
Walter), a minister who had been
an actor. Costelloe helped Bentley
with his amateur theatricals in aid of
the tabernacle, and Bentley reciprocated
by helping the Australian to qualify for
the Church. It was as a duly-ordained Rev.
John that “Jack” returned to Australia—a fine,
broad, solid shepherd, with a personality and
forcible elocution, of course. He got a living at
Newcastle (N.S.W.); and a while ago, when he
was in Melbourne, he put up a record by preach-
ing in the church (St. Peter’s) where he formerly
played the part of verger.
A very remarkable man was gaoled lately
in the U.S. The S. M. Herald records the event
this way :
Joseph S. Robins, whose frenzied financial dealings
have closed up 29 banks and other public colorations,
has just passed into a living tomb (the New York prison),
to stand trial for grand larceny. Twice he has tried to
“ baulk ” justice by committing suicide.
Still it is learned on good authority that, having
committed suicide twice, and being still alive, he
has promised not to do it again.
One of the most interesting old English
Fatmen who ever put his little bit of money into
Australian mining concerns was the late Russell
Roberts, K.C., who was chairman of the Einas-
leigh, the North Queensland copper mine which
is served nowadays by the Etheridge railway.
Russell Roberts didn’t know many things about
Queensland hackblocks, but one of the things he
did know was that the grog was mostly had ; and
he set great importance on good grog. Almost
with the first lot of stores there arrived on the
mine a full dozen quarter-casks of whisky —the
real thing, selected personally by Roberts, who
was a judge of liquor as well as of law r . It was to
be sold to the men, the chairman emphasised, at
absolutely cost price—the co. would prefer to lose
a bit rather than make anything. The first cask
was tapped, and handed round. The North
Queenslander smacked his lips and wanted to
know where the taste was ; there wasn’t a bite in
a gallon of it. That first quarter-cask was a long
while getting emptied ; and some of the rest of
the consignment was in stock for years, and was
at last sent back to Brisbane. “Not a bad old
bloke,” one Einasleigh hand said when the K.C.
died ; “ but no judge of whisky.”
SECOND NATURE.
DOCTOR: “Afraid there's no hope , my good
woman; I’ll- give him 10 days."
SICK MAN (half-delirious): “ Can’t you make it
a week, yer Honor?"
The late “Jawbone” Neild’s nine-hour
speech was beaten once at least in Sydney. Win-
deyer’s summing-up in the Mt. Rennie case ran
to 10 hours.

support a family?"
SARAH’S I NTENIDED: “ I don't want to support
the family. I only want to support Sarah."
While he was at Cambridge, recently-
deceased Bananaland Speaker, “Joey” Beil, made
his mark as a debater, and was selected to repre-
sent Cambridge against Oxford in an inter-
’Varsity debate. Austen Chamberlain was his
colleague.
To the surprise of nearly everybody, the
will of the late Jim Purves, K.C., of Melbourne,
was proved at under £9OOO. All is left to the
widow—a daughter of W. A. Brodribb, a former
M. of Victoria and N. S. Wales.
Nicholas Larkin, ex-Superintendent of
N. Police, who died last week, was the
officer sent to Broken Hill to take charge of the
force during the miners’ four-months’ strike —
which would have ended at two months if the
m stake hadn’t been made of arresting Sleath.
Ferguson and the other leaders on a vague con-
spiracy charge. In the days when he was climb-
ing, Larkin did great service in the detective
branch.
Dead at last, “ Cocky ” Burns, who was
the unaccountable Treasurer in Parkes’s 'B7
Ministry. He was an amiable, bustling old chap
who did nothing to be remembered by ; even the
border township which was named after him in
the Far West positively refused to build itself on
the N.S.W. side, and grew into Cockburn, on the
S. Aus. side. For years he has pottered around
Sydney, a garrulous old man whose enterprises
failed oneafter another—forgotten bv nearly every-
body, and living mainly on the memory of the days
when he was a Minister, at different times, under
Robertson, Farnell and Parkes.
Chaffey Baker follows his old political
(and for a time personal) enemy to the other side.
They dropped into a Ministry to*gether back in
84 —the "six-foot” Ministry led by John Colton.
But they soon drifted apart, Kingston into Radi-
calism, Baker into Toryism ; and the time came
when the then hot-headed Kingston invited the
other to come out and be killed. Baker presently
fell into his proper place as President of the local
House of Landlords, and, as such, became cha r-
man of committees of the Federal Convention,
which had its lirst sittings in Adelaide, with
Kingston as president.
Reginald T. Blaxland, who died near
Singleton (N.S.W.) on St. Patrick’s Day, aged
(>7, was the son of Arthur Blaxland, youngest son
of the pioneer John Blaxland. Arthur married
in 1839 his cousin Elizabeth, eldest daughter of
Dr. Forster, surgeon of the 50th Regiment and
sister of William Forster, one-time Premier of
N. S. Wales. Pioneer John arrived in Sydney in
the first decade of last century with money. To
break up a monopoly he started a dairy and
butchery on the site of the present Victoria
Markets, where he sold the produce of his farm
retail, in small quantities, to the poorer people of
the town. The just-dead R. T. Blaxland stuck to
the pastoral side of the business.
Dr. Arthur Lynch, the Victorian Irish-
man of the House of Commons, poured out a
poem as soon as it was announced that Botha had
been offered a baronetcy, and sent it on to the
proposed victim. Among other things :
O splendid chief, who stood’st a toiver of strength
When war and devastation shook the land,
Wilt thou then bow thy noble head at length
To kiss a master’s condescending hand?
And thou, the first of Africans, arise
The last of minions, buzzing in a Court,
And sell thy birthright for the trivial prize
Of painted toys and lures of baser sort?
Lynch, who has had the poem printed, recalls
that, though he “ fought for
the Boers ms Colonel of the 2nd
Irish brigade,” he “ agrees
with the policy of conciliation
and of burying racialism, but
is not in favor of importing
into that virile young country,
or into Australia, his birth-
place, the forms and shows
of a Feudalism which is dis-
credited and decrepit even in
Europe.” Many a Victorian
Naicest must shudder when
he (or she) reads kinsman
Lynch’s strenuous, not to say
ferocious, anti-Jingoism. One
way and another he is con-
nected with the big clans
which include the Molesworth
Greenes and the descendants
of Chief Justice Stawell. Still,
they can comfort themselves
with this—he is probably the
most diffusely-learned scholar
Victoria has produced. He
is a graduate in Arts (M. A.)
and Civil Engineering, an ex-
Science lecturer, an M.R.C.S.
and an L.R.C.P., and lately
was going in strenuously for
Law. And when a man has swallowed Arts,
Science, Engineering, Medicine, Surgery and
Law, one may fairly say he has fed well.
R.C. Bishop Reville, of Bendigo, lately
told his flock that he had had the privilege of say-
ing Mass in the house of Ananias in Damascus.
This Ananias, however, wasn’t the historical Liar.
The Liar lived in Jerusalem ; the Damascus
Ananias was a respectable person, whom the blind
Saul of Tarsus was advised to consult. There was
yet another Ananias whom Saul of Tarsus met. He
was the Jewish High Priest who commanded his
myrmidons to smite Saul when the latter appeared
before the Sanhedrim ; but The Bulletin doesn’t
know any rev. who has even taken up a collection
in his house.
Mintaro, where the Methodies of Mel-
bourne have been running their Girls’ Reforma-
tory —now to be closed because all the bad girls
have got places—is a remarkable shop. Captain
Gardner, a whaler, built it and sumptuously
furnished it. That was half a century ago, and
much of the old furniture is there still. After
Gardner turned it up, Captain McMahon, Speaker
of the Legislative Assembly, occupied it. A
curious legend attaches to the place. Captain
Gardner came home from whaling, it is said, just
in time for the last dress rehearsal of an amateur
performance of “The Fly’ing Scud.” They had
knocked his billiard-room and library into one to
make a theatre, and had actually introduced the
family horse, Dandy, into the house as Flying
Scud. As a matter of fact, there never was such
a performance in the place.
Cue of Sydney’s oldest and Fattest com-
mercial men, James Scroggie, died last week in
his 82nd year. He was the surviving partner of
the firm of Close, Scroggie & Co., the successors
of the old-time firm of John Campbell & Co., of
the Wharf.
Although Jimmy Tyson died as far back
as 1898, the last act in the work of administering
his Queensland estate didn’t take place till the
other day, when Acting-Chief Justice Real made
an order dealing with the undistributed balance
of £25.739. Drought came along soon after the
old man’s death, so the estate wasn’t rushed into
the market ; which mostly explains why it took
13 years to finally settle things.
The organiser of the Victorian Agricul-
tural Implement Makers’ Union, now arguing
points with Hugh McKay and others, is named
J. Murray Smith—which recalls memories of
other Murray Smiths who were distinctly not
strike-organisers. Still, the great Smith family
runs in all shapes; After all, we may yet have a
revolution led by one Bruce Smith.
“N.”'on the first Lord Denman (the last
is to succeed Dudley as G.-G.) and the great case
he was in :
Denman and Brougham, as The Bulletin has said, were
the defenders of Queen Caroline in the divorce case.
Denman believed in her innocence, and therefore made
an essentially weaker speech before the Lords than did
Brougham, who believed her guilty. Denman was too.
impulsive and indiscreet. Of George IV. Greville wrote:
“ A more cowardly, contemptible, selfish dog than this
King does not exist.” When honored with his liberty before
he was 19, he started at once to go the whole hog. Before
lie was 21, Parliament had to. vote -£30,n00 for his
debts, although be had nearly £OO,OOO a year.
At 26 he begged for £250,000 more. Largely
through his conduct the old King (George III.)
went mad ; the first outburst was in 1788, when he flew
at George, clutched him by the throat, and flung him
against a wall. No sooner had he become Regent than
lie quarrelled with his mother, the Queen. A few years
later George consented to marry Caroline of Brunswick,
on condition of double allowance (£l2O, opo a year), with
other financial privileges. There were executions in his
house at the time. The marriage was in. 1795. It is
alleged that George was drunk on his wedding day ;
certainly the King (partly recovered) had to prompt him
with the responses. Husband and wife soon separated, and
the wild misconduct continued. Jeffreys, a jeweller, wrote
bitter pamphlets on the swindling of creditors, which
made a deep impression. Though often threatened, he
came to the throne in 1820—and promptly got his wife’s
name struck out of the church service. Meanwhile,
Caroline’s friends, headed by Lord Mayor Wood, of
London, had not been idle. She had left Riigland in 1813;
contrary to Brougham’s advice, and continued travelling
abroad Tight up to the death of George 111. She re-
turned then, to her husband’s annoyance. He insti-
tuted proceedings, before ihe House of Lords, to
divorce her, on the ground of misconduct. Her
behavior in Europe had unquestionably been most
injudicious, especially with her courier, Bergami,
and there was a strong case. The second reading of a
Bill against the Queen was actually carried. But the
Government withdrew it; public sympathy with her was
so strong that the Throne would have been endangered.
Of course, a triumphant acquittal was claimed. Prepara-
tions then went on for the glorious, unprecedented
Coronation of George IV. Over a quarter of a million
was expended on if. The royal robes cost £24.000, and
the new crown for this saintly head cost £54,0,00. The
Queen presented herself at Westminster Abbey, but was
refused admittance. A nine days’ wonder—and in nine
days she was dead.
LOVE VERSUS PITY.
FIRST L ADY: “ Whom did. you rote for?”
SECOND LADY: “ Oh, dear, I was worried! The
Liberal was such a darling; but he has
money, and the poor Labor man has six
children.”

This Woman Spent Weeks
in Agony Until She Tried
the Tonic Treatment.
■ o
Many who are tortured with neuralgia will read
with interest the statement of Mrs. J. Adcock,
of Bunbury, W. A., who was cured of a very severe
case, by Dr. Williams’Pink Pills. Her experience
is only one of many, as these pills have cured a
host of cases, and those who have used them for
neuralgia have gone on sound medical lines.
Neuralgia is a nervous disorder, and experience
has proved that there is no better nerve tonic than
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Mrs. Adcock, whose
husband has a store on White’s Road, lives at the
corner of Railway Parade and Carey Road. She
stated :
“We were living in Derby, and the climate
there affected my nerves and brought on neuralgia.
I suffered dreadfully for weeks, and in spite of all
the remedies I tried I could not find any relief.
The pain w T as present all the time. I could not
sleep or eat and fell away in looks. I would try
applications of hot salt and hot bran, and any-
thing that I might get a little ease from. Every
nerve of my face gave me pain. It would throb up
to my temples and affect the backs of my eyes. I
could not see to read or sew. At night I could not
sleep ; 1 would rise and walk about quite frantic.
It was in cold weather and I dreaded to go out„
side, the nagging, shooting pains always felt worse,
and I would often have to bandage my face to
avoid a chill. I don’t know how I got through the
day’s duties, but they had to be done. I tried
many remedies all in vain, then I read in a news-
paper about Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and Mr.
Adcock got them for me out of our store. They
gradually toned up my system, and drove the
neuralgic pains away. lam always glad to recom-
mend this tonic, for I have never had an attack
since, my health remaining capital. I took three
boxes altogether.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by chemists

POLITICAL
POINTS
Melbourne Argus inquired, triumphantly,
the other day :
Suppose a proposition were made for an Imperial Par-
liament—Great Britain to have 440 members and Australia
44—would Mr. Hughes and the manifesto call this an
extension of self-government for Australian citizens.
As well might the Argus ask if Hughes, in the
event of his breaking his leg, would be likely to
order the limb of his second cousin twice removed
to be put in splints. Australia is not a part of
Britain ; the States, in the aggregate, arc Aus-
tralia.
Every time the Westralian miner looks at
his spud hill he curses State Frights. Federation
brought inter-State Freetrade ; but the State
Frighter climbs over that difficulty, so far as
spuds are concerned, by declaring that the spud
can’t be landed if it was grown within 50 miles of
a spot infected with Irish blight. So the Vic.
and Tas. spud is practically barred from Westralia.
and the digger has the joy of paying anything up
to 6d. per lb. for his vegetable. There will be a
Yes-Yes, anti-State Fright vote from him safe
enough.
The most amazing “argument” on the
side of the Referenda “ Noes” to date is supplied
by the Argus : “If the Labor party had faith in
its policy it would not make such haste. ... It
would be content to go step by step.” And if the
Argus had faith in its proof-reader, it wouldn’t
expect him to correct all the errors he found in a
proof—it would expect him to leave three-fourths
of them. And if somebody convinced the Argus
that monogamy was a good thing, it would pass
on the glad tidings with the reservation that it
isn’t a good thing to stick to one wife all at once.
“ Hamer’s ” horrible experience :
I can only explain it b.y saying that I had attended an
anti-Referendum meeting, and listened to a fat, well-
tailored person talking about how I, as a Federal citizen,
waslikely to do myself serious injury as a State citizen.
I think the idea was that I would kneel on my chest and
strangle myself. I went out and had refreshment,
because the speaker was very dry and unilluminating,
and he tired me. It was over the last drink that the
quarrel arose. I fancied I had cheated myself of the
change, and when 1 indignantly denied it I called myself
a liar. It was only natural that this should lead to a
fight, and I went to Hyde Park and fought myself for 10
minutes. It was an energetic battle, a rough-and-
tumble, and I had just got myself down when a police-
man interfered. I explained matters heatedly. The
policeman inquired if I was a Liberal politician, and
when I informed him that I wasn’t, he said there was no
excuse for me, and ran me in. The magistrate was
short-sighted, and when I tried to explain matters he
accused me of making fun of the Court. He said there
was no precedent for my behavior, and that the yarn that
I had cheated myself and used bad language to myself
and hit myself in the eye was absurd. I immediately
quoted Bruce Smith and other respectable, if dull, anti-
Referendum politicians. The magistrate, nevertheless,
inflicted a fine ; and, between you and me, I think he was
right.
Willie Judkins has broken into the agri-
cultural implement strike in Melbourne :
Why should there be any antagonism ? What a situ-
ation we have reached when Labor and Capital are so
bitterly opposed ! The Christ spirit and the true spirit of
brotherhood are the only corrective.
Why should there be any antagonism ? Well, for
the same reason that millions of people don’t buy
Judkins’s Refuse of Refuse. Judkins says it is
worth ninepence and he won’t sell it for less, and
millions say it isn’t worth more than tuppence,
and won’t pay more ; so the Refuse remains on
the .shelves and the millions go without it.
Wherefore The Bulletin mentions the Christ-
spirit to Willie, and asks him whether he will
take a pint of the true spirit of brotherhood
instead of the other seven pence. If he won’t take
a pint, will a gallon do? And if a gallon won’t
do, how much of the spirit of brotherhood will do
in place of that other hard, sordid sevenpence?
Anti-Referenda plaint of Melb. Argus :
We are asked to surrender our Wages Boards, etc., to
21 Victorian members in a House of 75.
A more pertinent query is: What is going to
happen if Victoria does not surrender its Wages
Boards to the Australian Parliament, hut, instead,
leaves them to the House of Rich Landlords
which really controls Victorian legislation ? Two
of the Murray State Boards are at present at a
standstill because the opposing parties cannot agree
on vital points, and there is no power of arbitra-
tion. And in two trades supposed to be regu-
lated by such hoards serious strikes are now pro-
ceeding, chiefly because the State Parliament
lacks those means of arbitration which the
Federal Parliament possesses. Furthermore,
where is the sense of a State handicapping itself
by wages boards while other States allow the
sweater to proceed in his own sweet way? All
the self-governing powers of all the States put
together cannot deal with a matter of that sort.
BOARDED OUT.
Owing to the enormous number of guests for the
Coronation, many minor royalties and others will have
to be boarded out owing to the limitations of Bucking-
ham Palace.— Cable.

The Implement Makers who are on strike
in Melbourne are getting stacks of information
about the employers’ love of freedom of contract.
Two of them got jobs as blacksmiths. They were
competent men ; but the second day the foreman
asked if they hadn’t been working at So-and-So’s.
They had. “I’m sorry,” he said, “hut the boss
said I wasn’t to take on any strikers. He’d be
boycotted.” Another had worked a week at a
timber yard when he was told he wasn’t wanted.
“No. there’s nothing wrong with you, but Mr.
Screw-and-Serape wouldn’t like it if he knew you
were here, and they’d make things nasty for the
boss.” These big employers love freedom of con-
tract so much that they won’t even allow a little
employer a hit of it.
The fact that the late J. C. Neild never
once got into a Ministry,
though in his time scores of
less capable men did, sug-
gests one big difference be-
tween the Labor and the
“Liberal” crowds, and re-
calls that the dreadful caucus
has its advantages after all.
Neild didn’t get office simply
because he was so loyal to
his party that there was no
need to buy him, while there
were others so uncertain that
they had to be bought.
Parkes made a practice of
this ; and Carruthers took in
Waddell, the man he had
fought as a danger to the
country. The Labor party
recognises nobody but those
who have signed the pledge,
and is thus at liberty to
bestow the portfolios on the
best men. The “Liberal”
crowd, having no pledge,
goes fishing, and has to throw
its first-raters overboard in order to make second-
and third-raters “safe.”
An astonishing effect of the Referendum
proposals is the improvement they have effected
in Liberal oratory. The Age and Argus com-
ments demonstrate that all Liberals opposing the
Referenda have suddenly become forcible, vig-
orous, clear, incisive, humorous, logical, brilliant
speakers, incontrovertible logicians, and poetic
and fiery patriots. The Age is prostrate with
admiration for Deakin’s wonderfully persuasive
magic again, after resolving some little time back
that Alfred was as musical as a flute and no more
conclusive in argument. It admires Murray’s
rugged common-sense, and Watt’s telling, scholarly
speeches, and, most wonderful of all, praises Tren-
with’s siren song. Once more, with fervent faith,
it rattles the dry bones—jawbones every one.
The “Liberal” crowd in Bananaland State
politics has issued an appeal to the Fat of the
land ; at least, it is not quite so much an appeal
as a bail-up. “It is necessary,” says the Fund’s
bosses, “to protect ourselves against Socialistic
legislation.” From which it seems that Bob
Philp, John Forrest and the rest of them are
really opposed to the Socialistic railways which
Kidston lately proposed ; so. if Denham goes on
with the business, Fat will no doubt be very much
annoyed.
J. J. Cohen, ex-Chairman of Committees
in the N.S.W. Assembly, stumping the country
in the hobbled-Australian interest, told Cooma
the other night that, prior to Federation, the
electors of N.S.W., male and female, were
masters of the situation. Apart from the fact that
that line of argument shows that the “No” side
in the Referendum fight is really the anti-Federal
side, when were the men and women “ masters of
the situation ”? When did even the men of the
last 20 years have the chance to elect or reject
H. C. Dangar, or H. E. Kater, or Henry Moses,
or John Mclntosh ? They are the masters of
the situation. Which, of course, is why Fat is so
dreadfully opposed to any more matters passing
to a Parliament which hasn’t got a House of
nominee, life-appointed Fatmen.
Tasmania leans up against the pawnshop
worse than any other State in Australia. It
hasn’t the biggest debt per head ; hut of the debt
it hAs got it has wasted more than any other bit
of Australia. Nothing has yet been discovered
that Tasmania isn’t prepared to put in pawn.
The latest example comes from Zeehan, where
even the local corpses have gone up the spout,
the Cemetery Trust, as it is nicely put, having
been “forced to seek accommodation from the
bank in order to pay the wages of the sexton and
caretaker.”
Westralia, which recently distinguished
itself by awarding a year’s gaol to a Jap for the
premeditated murder of a white woman, owes its
Judge McMillan to the importing craze. Appar-
ently W.A. can’t grow its own Judges, and, as it
would be too Australian and not sufficiently
“colonial” to select its Judges from lawyers in
the eastern States, the Westralian practice is to
bring them from England. The selection is made
by the Agent-General and two British Judges or
lawyers, and the brilliancy of the choice may he
gauged by the fact that Judges McMillan and
Rooth were got that way.
Dr. Morrison, one of the Australians who
have “done things”—he is probably the most
highly-paid man employed by any English paper—
looking from the perspective of distance and ex-
perience, told an interviewer of the London
magazine this recently :
I firmly believe in the White Australia policy. It is the
duty of Australia to “stake out claims for posterity,”
and to keep her continent, which can be settled and
worked by white labor, for the whiteman. Every China-
man 1 know condemns the admixture of the Asiatic and
the European, and despises the resulting offspring.
Dr. Morrison is the greatest living European
authority on China. He represents The Times at
Pekin, and his testimony is merely one more of
the countless indications that the world is recog-
nising the profound statecraft of the White
Australia policy, and the profound selfishness—
not to say imbecility—of the little crowd within
Australia which wants to streak the continent
with the tar-brush.
Says that truthful organ, the Age :
The State Ministry is to be commended for having
opened its Referendum campaign in an earnest yet sober
spirit. In no instance was “ high-falutin ”or exaggera-
tion indulged in, and the various points against the
Referendum were set forth at the Town Hall meeting
logically and without passion.
Follow three quotations from the calm, logical
speeches :
The chairman, Henry Weedon, declared that the pro-
posals of the Federal Government threatened the very
life blood, as they certainly threatened the usefulness of
the States. He hoped the people would rise up and pre-
vent the oncoming of chaos.
John Murray, the political cyclone, said that they were
told the Referendum was an amendment to the Federal
Constitution. If carried out it would mean the absolute
destruction of the Federal Constitution, and the tearing
up of into such shreds and fragments that all the King’s
horses and all the King’s men could not put it together
again.
Willie Watt, State Treasurer, profoundly distrusted
this Federal party in office. They would sweep away
everything that stood in the path of their unrighteous
ambition. They should be warned against those men
who went to them and said they wanted these powers in
the interests of liberty, when the very reverse might be
the result.
One can thus see how well the speakers avoided
“ high-falutin ” and exaggeration. Also, one can
see tlie value of the Age’s editorial remarks on
the Referenda.
MERELY AN OLD FRIEND.
S TATE-FATMAN: “ There's yer real enemy, young
man—fight !”
A USTRALIA: “ Well, if it does no more harm under
the new name than it did under the old, I don’t
think I'll worry much.”
The Bananaland Government lately ap-
pointed a Commission to advise whether any more
State or “central” sugar mills should he built,
and, if so, where, when and under what conditions.
The first thing the Commission had to decide was
whether the Commonwealth Parliament was likely
to strangle the industry. Though the Referenda
“Noes” assume that the Commonwealth will run
amokanddoall sortsof wild things, the Commission
fails to find any symptoms of insanity. So it as-
sumes that the industry won’t be strangled; where-
fore the State can safely go ahead and provide for
an increased output. It recommends that three new
mills should he built for the 1913 season; and
thereafter various others. The main idea with
regard to these mills is that the State should
advance the money and have the right to levy a
rate if the district fails to pay up interest and
sinking fund, the full repayment to be made
inside 16 years.
Some of Sydney Telegraph’s “ Warnings
to Workers” in regard to “What ‘Yes’ will
cost” are a bit unconvincing. For instance
(10/3/T1): —
HAIRDRESSERS, ETC.
In the barbers’ shops the men work longer hours here
than in Victoria, but they draw bigger pay for their
week’s work. The hours are in Victoria from 48 to 52;
here they are 59. The wages (for males) are here from
48s. to 58s. per week, and in Victoria from 455. to 555.
only.
In other words. N.S. W. barbers work an extra 11
hours for an extra 3s. per week ; which is to say,
the N.S.W. face-shearer’s overtime yields him a
little over 3d. an hour. And on the strength of
that munificence the N. S. Welshman is expected
to feel enthusiastic and vote “Yes” along with
the other Fatmen.
The Sydney law firm which includes Frank
Osborne, the Gent One who is tilting at the
Commonwealth land tax, is now having a tilt at
the Commonwealth note, too. The firm has a
new form of mortgage which includes this pro-
vision :
That the said sum of £ and all interest and other
monevs intended to he hereby secured shall be paid
by me (i.e., the mortgagor) to the mortgagee in gold cur-
rency ; and, notwithstanding any statutory or other pro-
vision to the contrary, no tender shall be legal unless
made in gold coin now current; or if the gold coin cur-
rent at the date of any payment shall be of less weight or
inferior quality to that now current, then I shall make up
the difference by the payment to the mortgagee of a pro-
portionately larger amount of the coin then current.
This recalls the time, not so long ago, when some
other equally long-sighted lawyers in London were
so dead-sure that gold was going to become a drug
in the market—it was at the time of the Cali-
fornian and Australian discoveries —that they
stipulated for payment in silver, if demanded.
However, the Corpulent money-lender really
needn’t worry about the Commonwealth depreci-
ating the currency. There are much better ways of
raising the wind than that—ltaly’s present 20 per
cent, income tax, for instance, on the interest that
Corpulent money-lenders’ collect; or even the Is.
3d. in the £ which Great Britain collected only a
year or two ago.
DE AKIN’S LAMB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Then there was the other innocent proposal, the little
lamb suggestion that the Commonwealth should take
over any business in the continent to which it
might take a fancy, and which Parliament might, in its
wisdom, pronounce to be a “monopoly.”—S. M. Herald
reporting Deakin's speech.
Behold the lamb of Deakin ! Woolly white.
The tender creature sports about the land.
Trustful, it holds an industry in thrall,
Waggles its tail, and lays a large, soft hand
Upon the people’s earnings. Its delight
Is to grow fat and make no noise at all.
A little lamb (who said a crimson cow ?) !
This latest-Yankee notion we have met
Is tender as Chicago’s melting soul ;
Its very eyes with charity are wet.
Be sure it is not here to make a row—
Beef is its aim, and gory beef its goal!
Why should we murmur? Shall our statesmen damn
A small commercial venture such as this,
A union of plain traders in red meat?
They come in peace, upon their lips the kiss
Of dear old Judas. Yes, it is a lamb—
A pretty lambkin, seeking things to eat.
Shall it eat ns? Nay, do not swear and shout.
Deakin quite understands its simple wa.is.
’Tis a kind creature ; in its own great land
It feeds the people, and each worker pays
Its pleasant tribute. Should we kick it out,
How shall our cruel Federation stand?
This lamb has lots of brothers, and they all
Are loved by gentle Deakin for the sake
Of one who holds him dear—his kind friend Fat.
How the sweet creatures frolic, how they shake
Their pretty little tails and softly call
To politicians on the outer mat!
Oh, for the sake of Deakin’s little lambs—
For Fat’s dear interest—pause, and think a while.
These Trusts and Combines are delightful things ;
You wrong them when you hint of fraud and guile.
Rise bravely, face and flout the Labor shams
Till with triumphant “ No ” the welkin rings I
No ! Let them keep the States and all their frights !
No ! Let us trust the Trusts that seem so fair !
No ! Let us follow Deakin all the wa}'!
For New Protection who shall strive or care?
Who worries for Australia and her rights?
Vote for the pretty lambkins at their play !

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 20, 1911.
My Dkaii Arini, —
Women, plain and fancy, wore their heads in broad
bandages at the MacCormick farewell gathering
in the Town Hall last week. This medicinal meet-
ing was punctured by appreciative remarks. The
Great Surgeon, impounded, under protest, to form
a target at which Sydney's perennially-genial
Mayor hurled an illuminated address, bhre his suf-
ferings with outward equanimity. The world has
ten fingers and a million-odd tongues. On five
digits it counts the foremost Knights of the Knife,
and includes Dr. MacCormick. The world will
lie thrilled to hear that an evening tea-party has
conferred the Order of the Soft Soap and Sand-
wich on one of its pinnacles.
Handsome Mrs. MacCormick received the hall-
mark of local merit in the form of a good-looking
leather-hound album, in which the visitor was
politely requested to write his (or her) name. A
Town Hall official, firmly attached to blotting-
paper, acted as Recording Angel. The
Ma yoress lent her rooms and presence to the
memorial service. Acting-Town Clerk Layton is
strongly suspected of having been responsible
for the floral color scheme. A riot of pink
flowers made a salmon-tinted sunset behind the
official welcome, at the entrance to this exhila-
rating entertainment. In the extremity of the
distance a mayoral mantelpiece modestly con-
cealed its legs behind a glorious tunic skirt of
vividly red cactus dahlias.
Miss Boys-Simth, who is branded—with many
honors—as a perfected sample of the cult “Girton
Girl,” has been recently and severely interviewed
on her arrival in Dunedin (M.L.). This was a
preface to her occupation of the new chair
of Home Science in the Otago University.
The Wellington correspondent who forwarded
this information to a morning paper maintained
a silence that is still felt on the stirring topic of
Home Life as annexed to the Domestic Problem.
This lias reached an agonised crisis in M.L.,
where everj’ other housemother regularly
breaks the law by working 16 hours—or there-
abouts—out of every 24, without overtime pay.
No air-cushion will he required to ease the sharp
corners of the Otago chair of Home Science if Miss
Boys-Sinith can organise a Mothers’Union, pledged
to go to sleep—on strike—when the last new baby
cuts its teeth at 2 a.m. as an early-morning exer-
cise. A school for training husbands in the art of
lighting tires, hand-feeding the young, scouring
saucepans, etc., and in giving no hack answers
when asked to get up and see whether a burglar or a
stray mouse has its head in the water-jug, would
make the name of Boys-Smith hit posterity with
a gilt-edged monogram.
The organiser of the star Sheffield Choir is like
a comet with two tails, in that he doubles the
“s” in “Hi irris.” Dr. Harriss has made a
minor miracle of the Sheffield ‘choir combination,
which has whipped the demon of class isolation and
laid it in the dust of half-forgotten discords. Lady
Nora Noel, a soprano soloist of note in the Harriss
team, belongs to the Gainsborough earldom, which
is in its third coruscation in the person of Charles
William Francis Noel. Lord Catnpden, who sings
gleefully in the chorus, is the soprano’s brother,
and meekly admits the republic of music by
keeping his elbows to himself, and leaving his
family tree in the North-land deer-park.
The recent and general meeting of the National
Council of Women passed off without anything
that could be described as a “hitch.” Several
old-tiine hatchets were so deeply buried under an
amiable top-dressing that a platform lady, in a
moment of expansion, suddenly presented Miss
Rose Scott with one cough lozenge.
Said, on creditable authority, that Mr, Tony
Hordern and his pretty bride did not book their
passages by the Moldavia, in consequence of the
home-dragging ties of building and hulls. Cattle
to he exhibited at the Easter show and a country
house at Bowral, in which 30 bedrooms will, form
an architectural detail, have prevented their de-
parture for London Coronation crackers.
Amongst others who may happen to look in at
the ermine-clad Heights of Westminster iii June
is associate-editor C. B. Fletcher, of the S. M.
HkraUD, who is alleged to he vigorously packing
up as this letter achieves a final full stop.
St. Margaret’s Hospital for Women wants prac-
tical help. It wants it immediately. All hospitals
suffer, more or less, from a chronic impediment
in their financial feet. Occasionally the symp-
toms become acute, and have to be relieved bv
garden fetes, sales of work or charity halls,
Bourke-street (Sydney) will, therefore, palpitate
with the thrill of a Dutch fair on three successive
days—March 30 and 31 and April 1. An active-
service committee, which is up to its collar-hands
in work, is alleged to he uncurling its Holland
before the murning milk meets the local rainfall.
The grounds of St. Margaret’s Hospital will
put itself into hunting in the Cause of Suffering
Woman on the dates already earmarked.
Mr. Edward Independent-Technique Atkins
has shown the Young Idea in Sydney how it can
chase the ivory keys at the rate of 400 to the
minute or thereabouts per medium of his musical
system, which is edited by Professor Marshall-
Hall and revised by Edward Seliarf. If the Girl,
as laid on to the pianoforte m Sydney suburbs,
can achieve the chain-lightning conquest of the
two feebler fingers of each hand, she will prac-
tically wipe out many of the technical trials
which now prevent her successful pursuit of flying
chords. Marshall-Hall is in harmony with the
Atkins Three-Movement Finger Technique, and
says so with enthusiasm, in a hold writing which
loops the loop with the handles of its “ li’s,” and
stabs a staccato nib into the imperative personal
pronoun that reveals the Marshall-Hall identity.
Mr. Robertson Kerr-Clark has recently shaken
off the sugar-coated shackles of vice-regal halls,
and tours the green and geyser Land of Maori on
his own account. His wife, Lady Beatrice, is an
artistic accessory to this escape from Government
House invitation lists. The Robertson Kerr-
Clark combination may he expected here much
sooner than the Japanese invasion. Sydney
friends please note —they will only poise on the
wing, before darting for the great Duke and
Diamond display.
Mr. and Mrs. Etherington are honeymooning
home to Colombo in the Moldavia. Mr. Henry
Gullett and Miss Gullett requested the pleasure
of the company of friends and acquaintances at
the Australia on Friday afternoon to farewell the
bridal pair. Mr. Etherington is a confirmed tea-
planter by occupation, and a charming personality
as a regular habit. After pursuing the tea-leaf in
its native lair for 10 years, he is convinced that
the white man who takes reasonable care of him-
self can keep the tropic microbe on the front
doorstep for an indefinite period.
Ivory-tinted ninon, disguising a main theme of
filmy lining in the same tone, had a Milky Way
of pearls wandering over its sinuous folds. Mrs.
Etherington, who wore this gown with enthusi-
asm, was also responsible for the good behavior of
its long curly tail which made a creamy S on the
floor.
This continent will not entirely empty its con-
tents into the side streets round about West-
minster. Mail steamers continue to pour out
cargo and carry-alls at Circular Quay and other
deep-water Sydney frontages. Amongst the Best
Dressed on the Otway, which recently hitched
itself up to its accustomed wharf, was Miss Flor-
ence Challis, remembered by habitual Tivoli
audiences as the piquant singer of “ The Bull and
Bush” a few years ago.
Mr. J. C. Williamson’s front hair lias agitated
the minor emotions of his Pitt-street headquarters
since his return from European tenors and top
notes. That hair lias plunged into grand opera,
and digressed from its former fashion of parting
’in peace towards the centre of the famous fore-
head which is alleged—on unreliable authority—
to have the “Blue Bird ” pigeon-holed in a recess
not occupied by orchestral parts of the Melba
tour. Concerning the “ Blue Bird,” an American
critic has said that not the least remarkable thing
about the hit it made in New York was its curious
effect on the audience. “They sat, almost dazed
as it were—too much stunned for the most part
even to show their pleasure in applause.” Sydney
playgoers are likely to suffer from a stunned at-
tempt to negotiate “ Why ?” if the “ Blue Bird ”
does not roost at Her Majesty's in the close
future.
Mrs. and Miss Macltircan, of the Wentworth
Hotel, recently returned from an overseas trip,
seriously interviewed the British omelette in its
secret fastnesses—the kitchens of the Carlton, the
Ritz and the Savoy Hotels. There the sacred rites
of the Silver Grill are in charge of such a Grand
Sultan of Saucepans as, for instance, Escoffier, the
Carlton chef. The privilege of watching the
preparation of a noted London dinner for notable
gourmands is a close: preserve. Mrs. Maclurean
obtained the freedom of the Savpy silver-lined
pan—a mqch more useful thing for a clever Aus-
tralian to keep about her person than the order of
the Strawberry Leaf or the ghostly Companion-
ship of St. George, who is too dead to know a fat
chicken from a fricasseed egg.
The Saturday Review, some years ago, dis-
cussed Escotfier’s Cookery Book with the reve-
rence it is wont to accord, on bended nib, the
higher mathematics, or the family history of a
political germ. Mrs. Maclurean has watched
with expert eyes the methods of Escoffier. (N.B.
—Any rush of Show-week visitors to the Went-
worth will have to be firmly suppressed right here,
as they say in New York city. Every “leading
hotel ” in Sydney is reported to have its accommo-
dation booked for the Easter holidays, from coal
cellar to chimney pots—there or thereabouts.
The budding architect, in pursuit of coin and
credit, who can devise a new and portable style of
roof, guaranteed to turn into a bedroom or a bath
tub on pressing the right button, is advised
to send his plans along to harassed hotel
managements without further delay. The
country is going to make the average town
tavern wish it had elastic sides and tabloid meals.
Easter arid following four weeks in 1911 will he a
record stuffing. City sparrows will have to'do
their autumn moulting in the horsehair fixings of
sitting Judges. No hotel will have any roof
spaces to let for superfluous feathers.)
Dr, Brady, who has personally inspected more
throats and tempers of star singing birds than
most local medicos, has varied his view of voice-
boxes by peering into the convolutions of bricks
and mortar. As a rapid result, he has rented the
Ramaciotti residence, Cravenna, during the
family flight across the British Constitution.
In the mournful meanwhile, it is alleged that,
owing to the painful pressure on hotel space, the
Ramaciotti quartet is trying to pack itself away
in cabin trunks and suit-cases as the most handy
method of finding house-room in a booming city.
A friend hands in the following solitary response
to her agonised appeal, per medium of the press,
for a good general servant; —
I wish to be treated as one of the family. My salary—
I should want 10s. weekly ; and if you have any children,
I could teach them music for the same per week as you are
paying for their tuition now. I have learnt dressmaking,
too ; perhaps we could make arrangements about that, too.
I am fairly good at millinery and can also sing nicely ; I
would like to help with household duties and really be
more of a companion. ... I have been an organist for
nearly nine years. P.S.—I am 19 ; look older.
This domestic Crichton, who gives her height
and weight, in addition to her age limit, must
have started her career as an organist in the local
church at the upstanding age of 10 years. It is
here suggested that a priceless treasure of this
description ought to he impounded as a gold-
medal exhibit for the “ What-to-do-with-our
Girls” Exhibition in April,
Fanny Dangn McKay, who persistently danced
her way into the affections of the Sydney stalls
and gallery, lias returned by the Otway, accom-
panied by her matrimonial property and his
beautiful daughter. The latter is an alluring
sample of the Girl tribe, generally described,
according to the Foster Phraser gospel, as sun-
kissed Australians.
A Blue Mountain waterfall—in working order
—is an uncommercial, rainbow-tinted spout of
gurgling drips. The chief scenic lion of Launces-
ton, its Cataract Gorge, only roars on strictly
business principles. Prime Minister Fisher had
to appease it with a tributary twopence. A
thousand pounds is no use to the globe-trotter who
wants to pass a penny-in-the-slot turnstile that
guards the Gorge. His hones will bleach unless
he drops a copper into its hungry maw going
through and coming hack. Mr. Fisher, according
to local tradition, had to borrow a penny before
he could persuade the scenic attraction turnstile to
let him escape to the Coronation via the Com-
monwealth.
Mrs. Sophie Corrie, just hack from “ delegat-
ing” in Hobart on the* Young Women’s Christian
Love and Lemonade Association, lias made holes
in the Law and the Prophets by skipping her
time limit of three-score-and-ten with the agility
of seventeen. She tickled the land in the
Colo Vale district for about 30 years, till it
laughed in bottled fruit, and habitually wore
Easter Show medals, plump tomatoes and pink-
cheeked apples. When the Hobart oldest in-
habitant remarked—in parenthesis—that Aus-
tralia couldn’t grow apples, I believe that Mrs.
Corrie absolutely forgot she represented a Young
Woman’s Turii-tlie-Other-Cheek-and-put-no-Pow-
der-on-your-Nose Association. She scampered
up to the hoary head of Mount Wellington to get
into fighting form; then returned to earth and
knocked the nonsense out of the Tasmanian fiction.
Concerning the J. C. Williamson jubilee and
things theatrical in Sydney, a venerable relic,
dated 1833 and called theN. S. Walks Magazine,
throws a dusty light on the genesis of the Theatre
Royal. An ad. on its ragged old hack begins
thus:—
Ir. is with no small decree of pleasure that the under-
signed (after much procrastination and many disappoint-
ments) is at lengt.ii enabled to announce to his Friends
and the Public the opening of the Sydney Theatre
(Royal). The readiness with which llis Excellency the
Governor lias granted a license, and the kind attention
with which He lias treated every communication relative
to the Establishment, call for Hie universal thanks of
those connected therewith, and the gratitude of a dis-
cerning Public.
The undersigned was B. Levey. The discern-
ing Public —now d*ust—and the Excellency who
was alluded to as He, are beyond the help of
capital letters. The alacrity with which an 1833
Governor of N. S. Wales granted a license to any
form of entertainment that would vary the
monotony of cock-fights and hangings, is a
quaint side-light on the humble attitude
of the undersigned Levey. Another item in this
gem of old-time puffs is its introduction of the
orchestra (to a discerning public) as “ men of the
highest respectability.” A hurried postscript
adds a mild note of explanation and describes
them (quite incidentally) as musicians.
The Royal Art Society’s exhibition of cabinet
pictures was almost air-proof on last Saturday
afternoon. A tepid interest was the outward sign
of an over-heated and limp group of picture-
tasters, who simmered gently in front of Lister-
Lister’s seascapes as the nearest approach,
provided by Vickery’s Chambers lift, to surf-
bathing.
Women-in-oils are an inconsiderable minority at
the Cabinet-pudding Show. Mabel Barling has
put some good work into an animal that wasn’t
worth it, and catalogues it “Lioness, Walking.”
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals mag take the artist’s woid that this
lioness can walk. It looks so weak and starved
that one wonders whether it had to he
propped up by Mabel’s easel after a prolonged
diet of paper hags and boiled lollies. Alice Cres-
wick exhibits “ The Old Cottage.” A new one is
urgently needed. Evelyn Chapman shows severe
symptoms of concealing about her studio the
makings of a clever artist. Stella Mac Nab has
dodged the color line and executed a negro. It is
a distinct sign of improvement, however, that Art
in petticoats is getting away—in cabinet size—
from the dreary glass tumbler and decadent spine-
less blossoms, which it used to hang on the in-
offensive walls of 76 Pitt-street, with a dogged
determination worthy of a puppy chasing its own
tail.
The cult of the Unsmacked Child was presided
over by Mr. Boorman at the Kindergarten Union
corroboree last week. He occupied the chair and
the proud position of being the only male creature
present. Mrs. F. A. Davenport, who helped to
mother the Kindergarten Union in its squeaking
infancy, contrived to illuminate the meeting with
some useful suggestions re extending the work of
gathering together, in Froebel frills, more young
and tenderchild-plants. Eight Free Kindergartens
now frolic in circle games, and attack the alphabet
and the National Anthem in their weakest places.
Froebel disguised work as play, and banished
the old, brutal method of hand-heating a child of
six because it failed to grip the hidden meaning
of twice six, or gasped in shuddering fear before
the unknown myth, b-a-t. Dame Hay, who pre-
sides in peace on the North Shore committee, and
Mrs. Malbon Thompson contributed ideas on ex-
panding free child-gardens in slum areas.
Mrs. Jane Grahame, of many charities, who
achieved the age of 83, and subsequently died at
her residence, “Strathearn,” Waverley, was the
widow of William Grahame, formerly one of Dr.
Lang’s imported stonemasons, and latterly a suc-
cessful pastoralist in the green heart of Monaro.
Grahame, M.L.C., built up a fortune—a form of
architecture not anticipated by Dunmore Lang.
The Grahame Memorial Church, endowed by his
widow, keeps the family name fresh in remem-
brance.
Miss Hilda Caro, writing near Colombo on the
main-planks of the Malwa, sends along the item
that she took first prize, at a fancy dress ball on
hoard, as “The Road to Ruin.” The garb
consisted of a scarlet frock, covered with
dice, cards and wine-labels, with trimmings
of champagne bottles—in effigy. As part
of this dizzy character dress, graceful black-
eyed Hilda sold cigars in the cause of
some seafaring charity. Her partner was “The
Devil,” who (for once) only took second
prize, the first being assimilated by a mere
man as “Suffragette.” The are no details
to hand re his attire—Albert Hall fixings,
Lloyd George flounces and Commons capers fichu
may have filled the bill. Vida Goldstein, a
Malwa passenger, is alleged to have enjoyed the
“Suffragette” frills as much as any anti-female
franchiser included in that phantom brigade
known to perpetual readers of social siftings as
“amongst those present.”
Also included in the Malwa passenger list was
Mrs. Perry, daughter of the well-known N.S.W.
pastoralist who is Bacon by name, and sheep-
breeder and benevolent backer of charity causes
by habit.
Miss Nellie Johnston and Surgeon Hughes, of
his Majesty’s survey ship Psyche, have come to
an understanding. Bride-elect, who is a very
smart dresser, is a daughter of the late proprietor
of the Newcastle Hkrald, and sister to Mrs.
Phipps, wife of Dr. Phipps, of Mosman.
At Manly, the other day, the surfers saw a
patriarch with silky, snow-white hair stroking
the waves affectionately with his feet as he
paddled in a few inches of water. “ Just saying
‘Good-bye ’ to old Nep.,” he explained when his
white mop brought some curious surfers up to
him. “Just saying ‘Good-bye’ to old Nep.”
Nearly 40 years it was since he had last been to
Sydney, and within a fortnight he expected to he
in his Wnyback home again. Nearly 40 years in
the bush, hut the 40 before that were mostly
spent at sea—anyway, the manhood part of the
period. One of his last voyages was with the
great Bishop Selwyn. the pioneer of Polynesia.
The lusty ancient himself was one of the numer-
ous Betts family and a grandson of Sam Mars-
den, Australia’s first parson. He was just down
saying good-bye to a lot of people and things.
King’s School. Parramatta, is among them.
King’s School dates from the early ’3o’s ; and for
the grandsons of Samuel Marsden there was, of
course, only one school—King’s. This Betts
was there in 1840—over 71 years ago. And the
interesting old man chuckles as he tells of tricks
played in the school as though they were wild
pranks of yesterday.
Yours, with a broad nib,
VANDORIAN.
But yesterday “Liberalism ” was denoun
cing the exclusion of Kanakas, Chows and other
undesirables as “not only un-Christian, but un-
English.” The parsons explained that, since all
men were brothers, it was infamous to exclude
the colored person from our midst; and the em-
ployer of cheap labor laid it down that such a
policy would cause the Commonwealth to be
viewed with profound distrust in the Old Coun-
try. Yet the Yorkshire (England) POST printed
this on Jan. 18
At a meeting of the Grimsby Immigration Board, 1 eld
yesterday, to hear ttie appeals of two Russian laborers,
who had been refused permission to land in this country,
the Stipendiary Magistrate pointed out that both men
were laborers without any knowledge of a trade, and
without knowledge of the English language. The Board
decided that the men shmdd he sent hack to Russia.
Now, will some Right Thinking Person please get
up and point out that Christian England, has
started behaving in a Pagan and un-English
fashion ?

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 20, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The rain-haunted V.R.C. Autumn meeting
ended wearily on Wednesday with the Steeple-
chase. From a dress standpoint, it was a half-
and-half sort of outing. Some women came in
furs and sweltered, while others looked blue and
miserable in cr6pe-de-chine. Not a Governor
blessed the show ; but Lord Lick Nevill guided a
man expedition from the G.-G.’s house party.
There were a few isolated and unenthusiastic tea-
parties —sorrowful remnants of postponements.
The dressing was entertaining in its way. I saw
an ermine muff planted with real hoily; also a
Fauntleroy dress of velvet with lace collar and
cuffs and red sash all complete ; but it was worn
closely fitting by a large-sized adult. “Granny ”
caps, which make a small dimpled Miss
look adorable, were hunched down over
every type of nosey countenance. Some
just-returned trippers (sounds as if they
were not suitable) wore fur scarves, each and
every one at the same angle, thereby proclaiming
that they knew the very latest in scarf-tilts.
There wasn’t a single harem-scarem ; which was
one thrill missing. So poor was the gowning that
women even found time to watch the racing and
indulge in the usual feminine shudder at the
steeplechasing. Most of them drifted town-
ward just as Trafalgar was galloping away from
the field in the Champion Stakes, and re-assembled
in one gossipy heap at a Collins-street tea-shop.
No one—not even a female tea-maniac—hankers
for Flemington tea, unless it is boiled out of her
own party hamper or poured in the stewards’
room. She will go with a thirst like unto that of
a goldfields camel through a sweltering race day,
and still snort at the Flemington brew. And only
the almighty stewards can say why this should be.
The Hon Mr. Thellusson, who has been visiting
at Guv’ment House during race week, is an ener-
getic young man with a valuable capacity for
organising amusements. The Dudley house has
been packed full of visitors lately, and most of the
happenings have been arranged and hosted by
them, the Dudleys joining in merely as guests, and
not as host and hostess. As well as the Champagne
Ball, the useful Thellusson—who, by the way, is a
sonofLord Rendlesham—engineered an impromptu
house-party dinner in the adjacent Botanical
Gardens kiosk. This plan of a guest acting as
host removes many official hindrances when a
house-party wants to frivol.
New arrangements have been made, and it is
now announced that Governor Fuller’s wife will
come out with him, and bring, as sixth child, a
cooing girl-baby, who is to be christened Victoria,
presumably after father’s nice new job. The
eldest child has seen 10 summers or thereabouts.
Governor Carmichael and his lady are breaking
out into garden parties. Invitations are issued for
two —one on April 3, and the other on April 4.
The engagement of the moment is that of
Beatrice, youngest of the Madden throng, to
Jack, the youngest of the Baillieux. “Jack”
Baillieu (his formal initials are M.H.L.) was the
pioneer Melbourne passenger to rise on the Ham-
mond biplane so early in the morning. Elder
brother Clive, who sits with dignity on ’Change,
is popularly known as “Jo,” and, as the papers
had briefly chronicled the family biplanist as “J.
Baillieu,” he spent an enjoyable morning re-
ceiving the congratulations he hadn’tearned, before
the city men discovered that the real hero was
little brother Jack. There are a number of
brothers in the Baillieu clan ; and they have all
acquired nicknames, a fact which tends to
bewilder the family’s numerous acquaintances on
occasion. The desertion of “ Jack ”to the matri-
monial ranks leaves two to bachelordom—
'* Prince ” and “Norman.” The bride and groom-
elect should not need any coaching in the intri-
c icies of the service ; as bridesmaid and grooms-
man they have assisted in the late marriages of
thj Maddens, and know exactly what a smart
welding should be like.
Lady Dudley opened a North Melbourne bazaar
the other day. An enthusiastic Irishman, the
Rev. Carey, declared in his speech that Lord
Dudley would return to Dublinasthefirst Viceroy
under Home Rule. The little Countess seemed to
start at the suggestion, but wasn’t called upon to
do more than smile it off.
\ The Madden lady no sooner puts off one lot of
mourning that another relation passes out. One
of Roderick Travers’s daughters, who married a
year or so ago, died in England last week. She
was a niece of the Maddens.
Club men are commenting, womanlike, on the
recent sartorial eclipse of Kiddle, of the squattages,
by a rival “Billy.” It happened at Flemington
on the first day of the races. “ Billy ” Williams,
the barrister, just back from England, cut a
dazzling figure in the very latest Bond-street
outfit—frock-coated, bell-toppered, brown-spatted,
etc., in accordance with London’s best fashion-
plates for the new year. It was an off day with
the local male dandies, and the splendor of
“Brummell” Kiddle was as naught in compari-
son with the up-to-date perfection of the jaunty
barrister. They have their official off days as
well as their glory days, these men at Flemington.
A card of instructions re the reception of the Gee-
Gee party is forwarded to the racing stewards.
His Ex. undertakes to arrive at a certain minute
and be “received,” and escorted to the vice-regal
pen as per time-table. And in the corner of the
card is an intimation as to whether the Guest of
Honor will arrive in tweeds and bowler hat or
“full dress 1 ” On this hint the stewards are ex-
pected to garb themselves, and thus harmony is
assured. There is no fear of a reception steward
in a shiny tall hat clashing with his Excellency in
a straw decker. Oh dear, no !
Miss Muriel Cumming, who regularly owns
some of the best clothes in Melbourne, is to be
married on April 13. Place, Scot’s Church ; man,
Captain Kenneth Buchanan, in the entourage of
his Ex. Carmichael.
An imposing and well-dressed bridge party
occurred at Cliveden, the Clarke ancestral white-
elephant mansion, last week, in aid of the Fancy
Fair. About a hundred tables were packed into
the ballroom ; opulent citizens gave silver prizes ;
the gas co. threw light (gratis) on the scene ; and
the furnishings and decorations were lent by
charitable firms. Pretty girls had cigarettes and
sweets for sale, and vended them from table to
table. The Melbourne stall was the chief object
worked for, and the Mayoress directed the efforts
of the helpers.
Mrs. Tallis is doing valuable work for the latest
bazaar. She has obtained the loan of Her
Majesty’s for an end-of-the-month affair, which is
to be mostly tea, talk and music. The concert
programme will be reeled off in the theatre, and
tea and sweet stalls will lure the moneyed to
spend charitably in the Foyer.
Miss Inez Hicks, the tall brunette of the two
sisters who ran a photographic studio in Mel-
bourne, and went abrawd with mommer when
legacies befell them all, is being annexed for
good by Mr. Rae, a rich Scotchman. After the
marriage they are to divide their time between
Edinboro’, London and Stirling. Small blonde
sister Nina became engaged some time ago to a
German she met in Scotland. And there is a
third sister who is not likely to be left to blush
unseen.
After all, Essie Perrin has decided to drop the
proposed orange-blossom interlude at Colombo,
and come straight on to Australia by the Osterley.
Wedding watchers will rejoice at the news that
she and Fred Kcrouse will say their “I wills” in
Melbourne.
Mrs. Cole, wife of Book Arcade Cole, who died
last week, was one of the early time “emanci-
pated ” women—practically a pioneer suffragette,
in fact. Her engagement to marry the Bourke-
street bookseller was arranged in the most busi-
nesslike way. Cole advertised widely for a wife,
carefully describing the sort of helpmate he
wanted. Miss Jordan, of New Town, in the
Apple Isle, saw the advertisement and sent in her
application. Cole met her, looked at her bright
black eves and her black curly hair, and asked her
to join him in Arcadia. The lady proved to have
an exceptional business head, and with her help
THE HAREM SKIRT.
Cole’s rainbow sign grew brighter. She was
always a jolly woman, and the “life of the party”
at Lome, or Olinda, or wherever she took a
summer holiday. And for all her knowledge of
the business world, she retained a simplicity of
nature which made her more than merely likable.
Miss Osborne, a pretty South Yarra girl,
bewails a postponement of her wedding, due to
the bridegroom’s illness. Everything was ready
and the cards out for the ceremony this week,
when the inconsiderate man developed typhoid.
This is the second postponement the ceremony
has suffered. The first date was cancelled owing
to the death of the bride’s father-in-law-elect.
The sick man is getting along “nicely, thank
you,” and the confetti will fly as soon as he is
convalescent enough to be nursed on a wedding
tour.
Hammond, on his Bristol biplane, has been fly-
ing round so successfully that the timorous public
which was beginning to regard flying as a perilous
business fit only for sky showmen, has been in-
duced to regard it as a new field sport. The
early-morning flights drew only the enthusiasts ;
the stolid, matter-of-fact citizen snored unmoved
through them all and waited for the miracle to
become a comfortable daylight show. Last week
at Sunshine—-where strikes and railway smashes
happen—Hammond satisfied the late-rising crowd
and wrungapplausefrom them under Taitdirection.
The first day, Thursday, was blue and fine, and a
packed special train ran out to Albion siding,
beyond the Hugh V. McKay colony. Hammond
rose, punctually to time, like a sky express, and
gave the crowd plenty of thrills from entrance to
ex t. The biplane was housed within a square
screen made of blue tarpaulin. As the crowd
arrived, the front rose like a theatre curtain and
the biplane tripped out like an ice yacht on its
small fat rubber wheels. Then the long boot
skates were pointed northward, and Hamm n 1,
in rubber overalls, stepped in and shot away as a
busy man slides from his front door in a motor.
It looked so easy that everybody in the ring
wanted a ride there and then. A very old lady,
who should have been shuddering, remarked
audibly that she wished she had a chance of a
flight. Hammond “flew ” twice. Though things
looked easy, he had to struggle with invisible
pockets of wind, and the manager spoke darkly of
“ ground currents.” There was a lot of water on
the flat flying area, and, under the hot sun, it
was evaporating and playing invisible deadly
tricks with the atmosphere. Mrs. Hammond, in a
purple rig out, wanted to go up; but hubby was
aware of those empty wind pockets, and shook
his head.
Sassiety went out in a heap. Those in the
know about the new motor road stood their gleam-
ing chariots in a semi-circle. The Edwards re-
spected the feelings of their big car which got
hurt at Altona, and ran out in a small, grey
racing motor. Mrs. Edwards is booked for a
flight some morning soon.
Musical people struck chords and rose to
crescendos at a meeting called together by musi-
cal medico Barrett to arrange a programme for
Festival week, when the Sheffield Choir will
invade these shores. Southwell, of Paling’s, who
had come to Melbourne to make ready the way,
was in evidence. Excellency Carmichael took the
chair, and improved his reputation for Scawtch
humor; Marshall Hall spoke to the gallery ; and
Freddie Beard very earnestly begged theassembly
to drop “ the littlenesses of divided musical sects
that gave Melbourne the doubtful dignity of an
overgrown village.” A fine programme was the
outcome of the rather conflicting voices.
Rita Hope, the pianist with the Lesehetizky
touch, and Tralford Foster, the soulful baritone,
give a co-operative recital at the Athenaeum Hall
on Tuesday (28th). Rita is to lead off with a
Beethoven sonata at 8.15 precisely, and thereafter
the vocalist and pianist will take the platform
alternately.
Miss Baskerville (who both sculps and paints)
and Miss May George are to hold an afternoon
reception among the pictures at the Guild Hall on
Friday, March 24.
Alice Grant Rosrnan, best-known of Adelaide’s
younger pen women, is in Melbourne, putting a few
final things into a bag before stepping on to the
Grosser Kurfurst to be taken to the Coronation.
Already in the bag are various imposing-looking
papers. One of them says she has the S. Austra-
lian Government’s commission to inquire into
female labor matters in foreign parts. Everybody
in Adelaide knows that if you hit “Rosna,” the
writer of the Adelaide postscript to this Chatter,
you’d be in danger of hurting Miss Rosrnan.
She’s much too valuable a collaborator to spare;
so, if you must hit her, please don’t do it fatally.
The busy star-steering Taits have added the
making of fireworks to their other activities. The
factory, which is brand new, has dropped in for a
good order at the very start of its flight, the
Commonwealth having called for £2OOO worth to
celebrate George’s Coronation. The factory,
which is situated at Sunshine, is seemingly the
first of its kind in Australia; so far the joy-fires
have all been imported. The £2OOO parcel is to be
distributed among the six States ; and, no doubt,
the profit on the deal will be divided among the six
Taits. “ Ted,” the fifth member of the entertain-
ing half-dozen, is back at work after his serious
bout of appendicitis. He con valesced at Wagga,
which is about as far as a busy man could retreat
from theatrical matters.
J. C. Williamson, just returned from Europe,
strolled into his box at Her Majesty’s one night
last week, for the 100th performance of the
flourishing “ Beanstalk ” pantomime. A packed
audience thundered out a welcome to him.
Blascheck, an entertaining Melbournian with a
fashionable limp and a turn for drawing-room
drollery, who left Australia long years ago, has
been making a success of his lecturettes in
London. He is to make a home visit shortly and
try the patter story on his own people. Lots of
Melbourne theatregoers remember him as one
who used sometimes to appear at matinees and be
genuinely funny.
From “Rosna,” of Adelaide: —
Mount Pleasant had its jubilee agricultural show on
Thursday, and snared the Excellencies and the vice-regal
daughter as chief exhibits. The George Melroses did the
incidental entertaining.
Lancelot Stirling, President of the Council, and his son
and his girls, are back from the geysers, hot springs and
the other shivery trimmings of Maoriland. The girls are
two of tlie best horsewomen we have, and chase the
deadly ani-eed bag every season.
.1. Pluvius and O. Sol vied with each other in threaten-
ing to spoil the tempers and millinery of the elect at the
Port races on Saturday. Nevertheless, a large and frocky
crowd showed its utter contempt for both old nuisances
by crowding the pretty course out of house and stand.
One magnificent steed made the smile of his devotees loud
in the land, his effort bringing them £5l 10s. apiece.
We make a regular practice Of exporting at least one
brilliant Noise-maker a year. This time it is Elford
Mack, one of our three pet ’cellists. The hero was fare-
welled at the Town Hall on March 4, and his tall night-
ingale sister, his brethren of the boomy instrument, and
various others of the musical peerage assisted in the
uproar. The Grosser Kurfurst will take him hence.
Adelaide has achieved a lady-dentist. Her name is
Miss Trixie Bennett, and she is dark-eyed and pretty and
possessed of piles of enthusiasm, deft fingers, steady
nerves, and a trim, up-to-date surgery right in the centre
of the dental and medical quarter on North Terrace.
Joyous advt. from a recent Advertiser: —“North
Adelaide—Furnished house, seven rooms, all con-
veniences, prompt possession. Maid available ; near car.
.” The phrase, “Maid available,” is enough
of itself to block the entire street with applicants. By
the way, one Adelaide firm has stored the furniture of a
hundred homeless families who cannot find a vacant roof
tree, and the boarding-housekeeper waxeth affluent and
uppish these flourishing times.
The will has been sealed in South Aus. of Colonel
Browne, who sailed with the Waratah last trip. He
leaves property in Dorset, Britain, valued at £102,678,
and some more at Mount Gambier worth £lBB,OOO. The
whole of it goes to relatives.
The Shakespeare Theatre is making ready for a week
of drama and festivity to commemorate the anniversary
of its patron dramatist’s birth. What is known as a
pastoral performance of one of the bard’s plays will be
given on the society’s mountain property at Eden Hills—
weather permitting.
The sole excitement of the week has been the appear-
ance of the harem skirt, not at. large, but merely in a
shop window. It was a bright-blue satin garment, and
pious Adelaide gaped at it and felt beautifully wicked.
Adelaide isn’t feeling as cultivated as it should. The
Town Hall being let to a picture co. for months on end,
high-art concerts have to be bundled into the Exhibition
Building, which is far too large, and has something the
matter with its acoustics. Awhile ago it was rumored
that all the musical societies were going to collaborate in
the building of a hall, but there has been a dark silence
on the subject lately.
Miss Edith Ralph can hardly be called a globe-trotter,
for she put in two and a halt years in Australia before
venturing to write a book about it. “ Empire Builders
in Australia ” she calls it; and though it is mainly a stew
of old and familiar facts, there are interesting portions
in which the writer gives her own impressions of things,
from the Jenolan Caves to an Anglican conference, or an
Adelaide private garden growing 23 distinct kinds of fruit.
She thinks a lot of the Australian girl-graduates, “bright,
clever girls whocan write Greek with facility, are extremely
well read, can play and sing, and yet talk with honest
pride of the cakes and puddings they can make, to say
nothing of their own simple dresses and hats. What
magnificent mothers that class will produce for the
future Australians ! With culture, refinement and ability,
yet ranking homework as a worn in’s highest duty! ”
(One for the London suffragette, apparently.) The book
is dedicated to Mrs. Henrietta Dalton, a married sister
long resident in Adelaide.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
Musical comedy and the London Gaiety have long been
keeping company ; but at last the drama has got a look
in. “The Captain of the School” is the title of the
new play that has compelled “ Miss Gibbs" to change her
residence.


HOW VALAZE BEAUTIFIES.
Valaze ACTS on the skin by virtue of its properties, which, penetrating into the skin, exert their wonderful and antiseptic stimula-
tion, so that the complexion gains in animation, color, sme— .hness and clearness. This makes it conclusive that Valaze is not, as are
thousands of so=called skin foods, an inert, indifferent, bland, inactive substance, that the skin is so much better without.
Therefore, if you wish for something that will make your skin breathe right ,
look right, BE RIGHT, you must have Valaze, the inimitable skin beautifying
Face Cream.
And never mind what you may hear about this preparation, so unequalled in
results, from people who have axes of their own to grind, I am broad-minded enough
to be able to say to you : By all means try their “ innocent,” “harmless ” products,
and then try Valaze.
Leave nothing to conjecture.
Only this much I ask you to remember: —
Where the appearance of a woman’s face is at stake, she should take no chances,
but should pin her faith to things that have a k7iown personality behind them. She
should insist on this as an essential precazition , before she allows any external inter-
ference with the functions of that most wonderful piece of Nature’s handicraft, the
delicate gossamer texture of the skin.
Now the next point of interest is this :
Skins may vary and conditions may be worse in some cases than in others when
the use of Valaze begins,
But you have my Unqualified Guarantee
that a fortnight’s to a month’s consistent use of Valaze, according to my directions,
will result in an improvement to your complexion that will be the source of your own
and your friends’ greatest surprise.
I can well afford to make such a statement —
Because I know , and the countless thousands of users of Valaze know, that it
produces a smooth, soft, clear and flawless skin.
Because I know, as knows every woman and man that have ever used it, that its
use, commenced in good time, secures freedom from wrinkles, crow’s-feet, sallowness
and looseness of the skin, and so confers the enviable gift of a skin that pleases.
Because I knoiv that in summer it frees the skin of freckles, tan, sunburn and
soreness; in winter it preserves its fabric’s elasticity, smoothness and natural
humidity.
Valaze first purifies the skin, and then embellishes it in the sense of restoring soft-
ness and lustre. But when the complexion gives no cause for complaint, Valaze
offers every reasonable assurance that it will continue to do so.
And the use ot Valaze does not make a greater demand on your time than two
minutes a day. There is no elaborate manipulation, and, unlike all other prepara-
tions, it does not require any rubbing. It is Valaze that beautifies the skin, not the
rubbing. The price of Valaze is 3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d. a jar, 6d. postage.
Valaze Freckle Paste, Mile. Rubinstein’s new remedy for dark and obstinate
| freckles, will prove a boon to the outdoor girl. From the first application the freckles
commence to fade, and gradually become fainter, until they disappear altogether.
ss. 3d. posted.
Valaze Powder, a dainty toilet essential for greasy skins ; the Novena Poudre
for dry, parched skins, 2s. 2d. posted.
Valaze Liquidine, an exquisite toilet lotion for summer use. Overcomes redness
of cheeks and nose, and greasiness, coarseness and pim les. Imparts a soft, dull
appearance to the skin. ss. anJ Bs. 6d.
Valaze Soap, perfect for toilet use ; it soothes and cleanses the skin, softens hard
water, 2s. 2d. posted.
Valaze Snow Lotion is a delightful preparation for outdoor use. It soothes and
softens the skin, imparts a fair, fresh appearance, and removes greasiness, coarseness
and shine ; 3s. 6d. and fid. postage.
Novena Cerate, a delightful preparation for summer use. The most natural
skin cleanser in the world. Should be applied instead of washing the skin during the
day. Cleanses, nourishes, whitens and beautifies the skin. 3s. fid., 46. postage.
THAT IS HOW VALAZE BEAUTIFIES.
Ninety per cent, of bad complexions are the result of ignorance in the treating of them.
You should familiarise yourself with the
VALAZE COMPLEXION TREATMENTS,
whose business it is to prevent and abolish bad complexions.
Allow me to tell you, through the medium of my book, “ Beauty in the Making,” why these specialities are indispensable,
will also give you the answer to apy question you are asking about the face or complexion.
Write to me for it, and I will gladly send it to you post free, because I want you to KNOW.

Path of a .35 I Caliber Soft-Pointed. Ballet in Dry Pine.
It enters like a net die but tears a hole like a spike.
High-Power Self-Loading Rifle
.351 Caliber
IT HITS HARD AND SHOOTS FAST.
c
This new Winchester hits hard because it handles
a cartridge which represents the highest develop-
‘ment in smokeless powder ammunition. Its 180-
grain hunting bullet will penetrate a quarter-inch steel
plate or thirteen 7 /& -inch dry pine boards and tear a
killing path as big as that shown in the illustration.
c.
It shoots fast because the recoil is utilized to do
the reloading. To shoot six times it is only nec-
‘essary to pull the trigger for each shot. This places
reloading as well as firing under the control of the trigger
finger, and permits rapid shooting with ease and accuracy.
For big game hunting, where the quarry often has to be
shot on the run, this makes it a particularly effective rifle.
c
The barrel of this rifle does not move back and forth
in a jacket, but is stationary like other rifles, and the
‘ sights are attached to the barrel itself, which accounts
for its superior accuracy. This rifle is safe, strong and
simple in action, easy to load and unload, easy to take
down, and a handy and handsome gun from butt to muzzle.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Dave Smith’s victory over Papke did not
arouse much excitement in the land of the latter’s birth.
In effect, the Yankees turned round and remarked :
“This fellow Papke is a bum fighter, after all. Ketchell
knocked him out once and twice beat him on points,
once in 10 and onee in 20 rounds. Then Ketchell fought
six rounds with Langford at Philadelphia, and it was
obvious that it took the late fighter all he knew to
survive the limited time of the disturbance. And hav-
ing seen how Ketchell was handled, Papke point-blank
refused to meet Langford at list. 41b., and slunk behind
the color line. In fact, who is this Papke Australians
are crowing about having whipped? Does anyone in the
great an’ glorious U-nited States know the fellow?”
They have no time for walloped pugs in the States.
* * * *
This is how Langford spoke some months ago
with regard to his future movements, operations and
campaigns:—“I am still after Mr. Jack Johnson, and
I’ll get him into the ring sure in course of time. I will
beat Lang first, and then I’ll tackle Kauffman. Nobody
believes that Lang can beat Johnson at any time ; so if
Kauffman wants to prove he is in the line for a fight with
Johnson, he has to beat me first. If he can do it, then
he’s sure of recognition as a first-class fighting man, and
Johnson must give him a match. If I wallop Kauffman,
which, barring accidents, I believe I can, then friend
Johnson will be compelled to take me on. That’s common
sense, and that, geu’l’men, is my policy, and it will be
followed until I have shown the public what I can do with
the man who beat poor old Jeff at Reno last July.” lie
carried out the Lang part of the programme all right,
anyhow.
* * * *
When the mail left the United States, the home
of freedom was filled with flapdoodle about another scrap
between Johnson and Jeffries. Johnson was willing, and
Jeffries was understood to be coy, while sundry outside
parties, described as friends of Jeffries, were moving
Heaven and earth to bring about a battle. Well
might Jeffries pray to be saved from his friends.
In furtherance of this crack-brained, dollar-raking
job, the weary old lie about Jeffries having been doped
has taken on a new leaseof life and is going splendidly.
But these friends of Jeffries get on the nerves. When a
man’s friends start to arrange for him to get an unholy
hiding so that they can make money out of it—well, it’s
time to take refuge with one’s enemies.

Mr. Papke set out for Britain in the Otranto,
last week, and remarked that Australia was a darned fine
place, and would be finer but for the people in it. The
people he can’t stand. He hates the word Australia, as
the name of a place where he never got a fair show or a
square deal from the crowd. When he started, or rather
when the ship moved from the wharf, there was
a dead and fearsome silence. Not a cheer bulged
the welkin. Papke was glad to get away from Australia,
and Australia was glad to see him go. So both parties
were satisfied. He is not coming back, neither next
year or the year after. In fact, he is never coming back
any more. Just before the steamer left he weighed
publicly and tipped the beam at 12st. 121 b. ; and
as he was fully dressed, and his clothes weighed about
Sib., he was, presumably, 12st. 41b. One hardly likes to
throw doubts on the veracity of the scales, but things
don’t seem right, somehow. Now was it Billy Papke who
was in the ring that night with Dave Smith, or was the
.1 n who was there a ring-in?
Yankee journalism has regretfully come to the
eo ielusion that there is no white man in sight who has a
hope against Johnson, and the name of the white race is
Slush. The white fighters reached their bloom in the
generation of Sullivan, Corbett, Sharkey, Fitzsimmons,
Choynski, McCoy, Peter Jackson and Jeffries. The cor-
rosion of time ate their strength away, and they gave
place to Burns, Root, Ruhlin, "Maher, O’Brien, Mitchell
and Hart. That crowd soon shot its bolt, and the
present crowd on the scrapping deck who pre-
tend to aspire to the world’s championship consists
of Miles McLeod, Con O’Kelly, Walter Monahan,
Ctrl Morris, A 1 Kauffman, Sam Langford, Bill Lang and
George Cotton. Langford has practically biffed Lang out
of the running; Monahan went down to Cotton, and
Cotton himself was sparring at Reno with Johnson, and
there ably demonstrated his utter inferiority to the Big
Smoke. The McLeod is quite unknown, and is a new
proposition brought forward by old-timer Choynski.
The solemn truth of the matter is that the
white men who have the brains and grit to become
world champions are above the Igame, and John-
-B>n has to fear attack from inferior sections of
his own rather than the dominant race. That the
white race can produce as tough and as strong
fighters as it did a few years back goes without saying.
It is impossible to believe otherwise. The spirit of the
time is against the production of a white champion ;
therefore it looks as if Johnson, so long as he can hold
his own against some colored brudder, is in for a reign of
a year or two yet.

This Carl Morris is quite a new sprig of asparagus
The way he came to start professional pugilism last July
He had been a famous local amateur in
ihe town of Sapulpa, a God-forsaken hole somewhere on
the North American continent. One night a fearsome
Redskin known as Euchre Joe got busy, and cleaned up
the entire police force of the town. He was going
strong when Morris appeared, and, with a few well-
directed heavy ones, put the Indian to sleep. Sapulpa
hailed him as the hope of the White Race; but, consider-
ing that the Indian was said to have fought the entire
police force of the town, and was, moreover, drunk,
the recognition seems to have been premature.
Even six policemen help to wear a man out.
Anyhow, Morris decided to cease being a fireman.
He knocked out a heavyweight named Ed. Anderson in
five rounds; stopped another named Jim Harper, of
Kansas City, in three; battered Tim Hurle3 r into un-
consciousness in three rounds ; smashed up a big fellow
known as Battling Britt in one round; and then drew
4000 people to see him pulverise Marvin Hart in three
rounds. His particular part of the farmyard is quite sure
that Morris is It.

The first day of the Parramatta Hundred drew
a huge crowd to Sydney’s classic aquatic course. The
motor-boat was abroad in its glee ; the graceful j'acht,
white-winged and beautiful, floated lazily ; and the ugly
steamer made hideous noises. The day was not wildly
interesting; the programme consisted only of four
qualifying heats, and the chief interest hung
round the question of how Dick Arnst would
shape. The crowd did not know that the mighty sculler
was a very sick man ; but against all advice he got into
his boat and risked his life in a hopeless task. He rowed
nearly the whole course ; but he was a sick man, and was
out of it from the jump. It was a bitter disappointment
to those who had gone there specially to see him put up
a fearful struggle in the face of odds and a handicap
which were almost overwhelming. Dick dropped out
right there. Followers of the game got a pointer from
the fact that George Day beat Sydney Kemp off the same
mark in his heat, and the fact that Kemp is matched
with Harry Pearce makes that fact of some slight in-
terest. Another interesting item was that Hagney, on
the 18sec. margin, won his heat, and will figure among
the 12 who qualified on the day for the final.

One grows weary of the continual reiteration of
the statement that Australia’s main defence must be
aerial, in face of the fact that Japan owns 25 of these
machines, and Australia none. The fact has also got on
the nerves of the Dunlop Rubber Co., and that patriotic
corporation proposes to start a subscription-list, to which
it is thought that the Commonwealth should sub-
scribe, say, £5OOO as a prize for a flight between Mel-
bourne and Sydney. But, after all, how is that going
to help in the establishment of an Australian aerial battle
unit? Far better to vote the money for the founding of
a school of aviation, and thereby create a corps of air-
men and a squadron of aeroplanes for them to investigate
the matter with. Other nations are doing this. France has
set aside £240,000 for aerial development, while Germany
has 'engaged Orville Wright at a substantial salary as
aviation master to the German Aerial Corps, which will
have a fleet of 100 machines by June. Britain is also
training a similar corps. And it is about time Australia
did likewise. If the Dunlop Rubber Co. will look into
the matter, it will probably devote its energies and re-
sources to helping the Government do the same thing,
instead of creating a huge prize for one single inter-State
race.

Trafalgar added his name to the list of really
good horses that have won the Champion Stakes at the
V.R.C. meeting. All things considered —the stake being
nothing wonderful and the distance three miles—it is
remarkable that the race has maintained its reputation
all these years. Once in a way a second-rater proves the
best of a moderate lot (Peru was not first-class, neither
was Parthian of old); but the rule has been for at least
one fine performer to go out and prove its superiority as
a stayer to the best of the “ handicap ” horses so called.
This year Trafalgar won easily from Alawa, who had no
trouble in beating the more fancied Bobadea. The
applause of the crowd, when the honest chestnut can-
tered home, had a ring of sporting feeling in it. Trafal-
gar is not actually brilliant, but he is great in pluck and
consistency ; and, anyway, he has carried 9st. odd into
fourth and second places for the Melbourne Cup, not to
mention his Sydney Cup victory as a three-year-old. If he
remains in his present form, and meets Comedy King in a
test of stamina at Itandwick, the Englishman will have no
picnic.
* * * *
Seems to be generally reported that Patronatus
is a “rod in pickle” for the Sydney Cup. The disap-
pointing animal has a lot of failures to redeem, and his
ability to stay two miles has not yet been even suggested
in public. The more wonderful his gallops in private—
something very great is said to have happened during
his recent sojourn in Melbourne —the more probable that
Patronatus lacks heart for a hard struggle with the colors
up. The horse’s record is not reassuring. He has so
often started first favorite (twice for the Metropolitan
Stakes) and so frequently been beaten. But the weight
(Bst. 21b.) for the Sydney Cup is no more than he was
asked to carry six months ago, and time may have done
much for the son of Patronage.
The inevitable suggestion that Comedy King is
“ as good as Carb.ne " will not be adopted yet awhile by
the best judges of the game. Granting that the English
horse is still a younger four-year-old than Carbine was when
he ran second (with 10 stone) for the Melbourne Cup
and won his second Sydney Cup carrying 9st. 91b., there
is positively no reason to think that he might rival
Carbine’s performance, as a five-year-old, of winning a
Melbourne Cup with 10st. 51b. up, and two lengths to
spare. Or, if the handsome black horse is really a
great weight - carrier, despite his comparatively
long back, he doesn’t appear to be such a free-and-
easy sprinter as Carbine was. Comedy King’s
failure in the Futurity Stakes (7 furlongs) looked
like the result of his lOst. 31b. burden in a very fast race.
His speed was not equal to the weight. Broadsword,
carrying 9st. 71b., made a longer struggle, and the winner,
three-year-old Blairgour, had Bst. I2lb. up; so Comedy
King’s performance in running third was not compara-
tively brilliant. It was his only attempt, thus far, to prove
himself a weight-carrier, and he failed. Perhaps the pace
would have beaten him even though he had been less
heavily penalised, for it was faster than when he won the
same race last year (with only 6st. 121 b. up) from the still
more heavily'-penalised Maltine. When he tried last year
to win the Newmarket, with 7st. lib. he wasn’t slippery
enough. He finished only fifth. But Carbine never ran
otherwise than brilliantly in a sprint race. As a three-year-
old, when notquitefit, he ran third for the Newmarket, car-
rying Bst. 121 b., to Sedition (7st. 121 b.) and Locbiel (9st.
41b.), and before the meeting was over he beat the mighty
Bochiel, at a difference of 41b., in a long-distance race.
He won the Flying Stakes (7fur.) at Flemington two years
in succession. The fastest two-year-olds of his time could
never get a break on the field when Carbine was in it.
He gave them 2st. and ran over them every time. And
against Carbine’s long-distance records the only per-
formance that Comedy King has shown, thus far, was a
Melbourne Cup victory, with 7st. 121 b., when Trafalgar
nearly succeeded in giving him 191 b. His best weight-
carrying display was in the Essendon Stakes the other
week. He carried Bst. 111 b., or 61b. less than Trafalgar,
and gave the tough veteran a 61b. beating perhaps. This
doesn’t surpass Carbine’s record as a three-year-old, and
Comedy King is now a 3J-year-old, anyhow.
Indirect evidence of a jockey syndicate of
punters is fairly strong. Some of the “ reversals of
form ’’ noticeable in handicap races of late have been
identified with certain jockeys and suspicious market
movements. And certain backers, apparently in
co. with the quartette or quintette of riders, are always
“ on ” the chosen animal, which either wins or goes very
near it.
* * * *
“0.K.”: Seems to me that the A. J.C., in its
sound policy of increasing the endowments to w.f.a.
races, might go further in the way of inducing owners of
first-class horses to resist the temptations of the foreign
buyer. There are no rich prizes (in either N.S.W. or
Vic.) reserved to gees of four years old and upwards, nor is
there any limit to the weight which may be humped upon
a great horse’s back in the richest of the handicaps.
Consequently the owner of a champion three-year-old that
has captured, say, the two principal Derbies, the Mel-
bourne Cup, and subsequent w.f.a. events of the
season must be a very wealthy man if he
can afford to refuse a handsome offer for his
colt from a foreign buyer. Its prospects of winning
a lot more money in stakes as a “ four-year-old and
upwards” are not dazzling. Each season brings fresh
three-year-olds into the competition for w.f.a. stakes,
and the older crack’s chances of annexing big handicap
prizes are poor indeed. The best tliree-year-old has im-
mensely greater possibilities than the best four- or five-
year-old of its year. A Carbine is the rare exception that
proves the rule. Australia’s most famous quadruped had
a unique capacity for making light of an exceptionally
heavy burden, and so he rose superior, as it were, to
the handicapping system which is unduly rough on the
very best horses as they advance in years. His capacity
for carrying 10 stone and more as though it were only nine
stone or less, is essential to real greatness in a racehorse,
the handicappers may say. If so, why is the w.f.a. scale
restricted to 9st. 51b. for veteran racers ? If it was per-
missible to put a burden of 10 stone on a rather small
mare, like Wakeful, for the Melbourne Cup, why is 9st.
51b. the limit in w.f.a. races over any distance ? But this
inconsistency in handicapping argument is not the chief
point now under consideration. We are speaking of the
fact that owners of crack performers are not sufficiently
encouraged to prolong their racing careers in
Australia. There should be at least a couple of
rich Maturity Stakes every season at Randwick
and Flemington respectively; one in the spring
and the other in the autumn. Young- two-year-olds could
be entered for a Maturity Stakes of two years later, as
yearlings are entered for Derbies. Also, any three-year-
olds that had not been entered as youngsters at a low
figure, should be eligible for entrance at a fancy fee, say
100 guineas. And so on, year after year, the original
two-year-old entrants being eligible for re-entry each
season on further payment of the original fee, whilst
those that came in as three-year-olds would have to be
re-entered at the high fee. A Maturity Stakes should be
worth at least £3500 to the winner, £l5OO to the
second, and £750 to the third horse. Two of such
races per annum ought to be possible if the A.J.C.
and V.R.C. were to make a joint effort. Up
to now, the two chief racing- clubs have made
no joint effort to do anything for the promotion of sport,
as apart from gambling. They can’t even agree to prevent
their big Spring meetings from clashing.
Patronatus was scratched for all his Y.R.O.
engagements when the rain began to fall on the Autumn
meeting, the Sydney horse being “ useless in heavy-
going,” it was said. Probably the intending backers of
Patronatus would have lost their money though the
ground had been as hard as a brick. Within the past 18
months he has gone out first favorite for eight of ihe
10 races he ran, including the Metropolitan. He won two
of them this season, his price being 7 to 4 against in
onecase and odds-on in theother. Last season, as a three-
year-old, he ran six times, and was always beaten. His
backers laid even money in one case, and odds-on in two
cases. His record up to date gave Patronatus a poor
chance to win the Australian Cup ; but the prophets
were tipping him as dangerous, and visitors from Sydney
were talking of him with bated breath as though they
“ knew something.”
* * * *
The term “stopping the favorite” seems to be
taken literally at Vic. up-country race meetings. At
Wodonga or thereabouts, when a Maiden Hack Race was
coming to a finish, a demon horseman rode across the
track and tried to block the way of the favorite. The
jockey dodged the impediment, however, and steered his
mount to victory'. After which the ras>- '>: -der was
captured and tied to a post until two lr ja; Pays let
him loose on bail.
J. H. G. Pountney, who has been judge for the
Queensland Turf Club for 15 years, has given it up.
Altogether he has been connected with the Q.T.C. for
more than a quarter of a century ; he was secretary
and handicapper for over 10 years before he took to the
judge’s box.

Returning from M.L. to contest ’Stralian w.f.a.
events this autumn, the crack four-year-old mare, Lady
Medallist (St. Alwyne-Diploma). winner of many' big-
handicaps in Wardland. Bred by'Moses Bros. (Ma State),
she was bought as a yearling by J. B. Reid (M.L.), and
has gathered in much oof. She will go into F. McGrath’s
stable, and Ohas. Jenkins will probably come across later
on to do the riding.

Victorian Oofball continues in a mixed con-
dition. The League keeps on layin’ low an’ say in’ miffin’,
but is stealthily feeling round for some weighty bricks.
One of them will fall on the S. Aus. League, which lately
renewed its compact for inter-State games with the
Association for another five years. As the S. Australian
body belongs, like the Vic. League, to the Australasian
Football Council, while the Vic. Association doesn’t, this
action will further complicate matters when the triennial
tourney happens at Adelaide next August.
Two N.S.W. championships changed hands on
Saturday at the annual kick-up in honor of St. Patrick.
W. F. PattiBon gathered in the 440yds. State champion-
ship from Redmond and McNeil in 52 3-ssec. The mile
went to T. J. Wood in 4min. 48sec., with Flowers and
Cole only a few yards away. The “ Cardinal’s Cup,” the
most valuable amateur sprint event of the season, pro-
duced a fine struggle, which resulted in favor of W. P.
Booth, with Strickland, Willisford and Harwood close up,
only about a yard separating the four,

The successes of George Gray grow wearisome.
Will no one arise and give this monotonous youth a wal-
loping, just to take away the air of dreadful sameness?
His latest exploit, at time of writing, was to obliterate
Harverson in an 8000 game. It was a dreary' spectacle,
Gray getting set and occupying three successive “ses-
sions” till he had made 2196 in one break. This isn’t
sport, it’s just weariness. When the awful spectacle was
over, John Roberts, on behalf of Gray, formally challenged
Stevenson for the championship and £lOOO. But the
champion is side-stepping. Who wouldn’t side-step a
game like that.

Sydney First-Grade cricket commenced its
ninth round on Saturday, under pleasant conditions con-
ducive to a good perspiration. Two centuries graced the
board, E. P. Barbour making 153 for University, and
V. Y. Deane smacking up 102 for North Sydney. Some
of the bowling figures also wore a charming aspect.
H. Woolcott, of Middle Harbor, took two Waverley
wickets for one run ; A. E. Sullivan, of Balmain,
dropped six Petersham sticks for 36 ; and T. Owen,
of Burwood, did the same with Redfern. Kerim, the
Syrian of Redfern, retaliated with four for 13, and Mailey,
of the same club, assisted him by taking three for 13.
Glebe smacked up 173 against Central Cumberland,
which, when stumps were drawn, had made 57 without
the loss of a wicket. North Sydney bashed 289
for the loss of nine wickets, and went home
feeling it had enjoyed a good time. Middle
Harbor smacked up 350 against Waverley, and
Waverley responded with two wickets for nine runs,
which was an almighty bad start. But the daddy score
of the day was University’s 395 for six wickets.
Petersham could make only 147, against which Balmain
placed 73 for five wickets. Burwood did worse, with 72 ;
then Redfern, the Syrian suburb, got loose and smacked
up 131 for nine wickets; so, on the showing, Burwood is
in for the father of a walloping.

The Springboks wiped the last match of the
tour off the slate by mopping up Broken Hill even as
Broken Hill mops up the long beer on a thirsty day.
The figures were an innings and 278 runs. Champion
batsman G. A. Faulkner carried his timber for 252 in a
total of 531 made by Africa. By doing so he lifted his
aggregate score for the tour to 2080, which is a record
well ahead of that held by any previous visiting batsman.
B.H. made 148 and 105, which was a respectable showing
against the formidable googly bowling.
The best scores of the Springboks were made in
their first and last matches. The first saw 507 smacked
up, the last 531. The eleventh, which happened about
half-way through the tour, saw 506 on the scoring board.
Sydney was a disastrous field for the Springboks ; they
were walloped in every match played there. Melbourne
saw them lose three out of four, but in Adelaide they
smashed everything that stood before them. Another curi-
ous item is the fact that L. Strieker, who put up the biggest
individual score of the tour (146), did it in the first match,
before he had recovered his land legs ; and in the return
match last week he was outed in both innings for nought.
A pair of specs, in fact.

Rain spoiled the “benefit” to ye ancient
cricketer, “ Tommy ” Warne, in Melbourne. It was to
have been a three-days’ affair ; but the rain on the Mon-
day washed the fixture right off the slate. The Friday
yielded £4l, Saturday £l2l ; which gave a total of £162.
By the time the exes, are taken out of it “Tommy”
won’t have the price of a champagne supper left.

Pitcher, the bowler who was no-balled in the
Victorians’ last match with the Springboks, is stirring up
the dust in the city of Weary. Through his club,
Collingwood, he has demanded and been granted an early
inquiry to investigate the decisions of umpire Crockett.
Sherwell said two nice things about Australian
cricket before his team finally left Adelaide; and he gave
both as being: his deliberate opinion. One is that no pre-
vious team ever or anywhere, has had such a strong
string of batsmen as Australia’s first five at present. The
other that Australia, just now, could play England and
South Africa put together 1

Webster the young- Central Cumberland
(Sydney) wicket-keeper, being now resident in Adelaide
was given a trial for South Aus. against South Af. He
kept” well, and made a neat 23 in the first inning •
but shared in the horrible slump in the second. When
that, disaster was at an end, the board showed only one
double-figure score. Crawford’s 40 was the exception.

Aviator Hammond moved a Melbourne crowd
to ecstasies the other day by suddenly “dropping his
machine” (as they supposed) 30ft., and'then gracefully
arresting its amazing descent. As “an illustration of
the aviator’s perfect control ” of the instrument, this was
regarded with amused interest rather than awe, and
Hammond got the reputation of being a bit of an aerial
humorist. As a matter of fact, the biplane was dropping
itself. A couple of wires had gone wrong, and he suffered
the most exciting time of his life whilst readjusting them.
Had his nerve or manual dexterity failed him, ihe
machine would have continued to drop until it bumped.
An aviator needs to have nimble fingers as well as nimble
wits. Hammond developed nimbleness with the fingers
at the piano.

Importation of sporting material is rampant

Leaving out Brookes, Heath and Dunlop, who
are away, Victoria sent its best available tennis six to
Adelaide for the inter-State match—Barnard, Addison,
Lycett, Herring, Rolland and Jamieson. These met and
beat (13 matches to eight) Taylor, Barritt, Reid, Thomas
and the brothers O’Dea. That both teams were com-
parativelv youthful was a rare and pleasing feature. The
S.A. ladies got their usual awful licking. Miss Parr
cannot keep up for ever her champion form of 20
years ago, and her younger associates are not adequate
successors.

“Dux”: M.L. champion pi goon-slayer, D.
Fraser, has for some time past challenged all-comers to
shoot a match (100 live birds) for £lOO aside. The chal-
lenge was lately accepted by E. P. Graham, and the
trouble was gone into at Christchurch. There was great
slaughter, and after the smoke had cleared away,
Graham emerged victor with 85 murders to his opponent’s
78. Bad weather conditions saved further slaughter.
Two big rowing events lately attracted enthu-
siasts to the Lower Yarra. The Pair-Oared Champion-
ship of Victoria was won by Footsei ay City, who were a
length and a quarter in front of Civil Service. For the
other, the Amateur Champion Sculls, there was a record
entry of nine, who gave the spectators some entertain-
ment. Ivens, the former champion, capsized early in the
race ; three more crashed into his upturned boat; while
Luke, of Ballarat, lost a good position by irregular steer-
ing at Spotswood Point. Despite his inaccuracy, how-
ever, he secured second place, the winner being Stevens,
of Essendon, with four lengths to spare. Time, 17min.

The balance-sheet of the N.S.W. Rugby Union
shows how thin a skin separates a prosperous sporting
body from the abyss of bankruptcy. The loss on the
year’s proceedings was £1362 9s. 4d., and the Union is
feeling sore. Still, it has a credit balance of £1586 left,
and it doesn't intend to go under without 'making a
fight. But when one unsuccessful season can wipe out
half its resources, it becomes apparent that sporting
bodies are idols with feet of very soft clay.
This coming Davis Cup struggle promises to
be bitter. Three over-sea challenges have been biffed in
on Australia—from England, United States and South
Africa. In the preliminary, England will look on at
Africa and the United States doing the sweating act, and
will then engage the winner. After that the winner of
the second bout will come to Maoriland, and we shall see
things.

Horace Stevens, the winner of the Vic. Sculling
Championship, owns classic features and grey hairs, and
is somewhat of the Greek-god type of athlete. Hitherto,
he has made a bit of a niche in Melbourne social world
in the less strenuous occupation of public singing ; but at
35 he has come to light rathertoo late to hope to conquer
many sculling worlds. Nevertheless, on form, he is at
the moment Victoria’s best.

“F.J.N.”: A Melbourne suburban scorer in-
vented a new cricket term the other day—“ Tossed out.”
The batsman hit the ball through the slips, low
down. The man in the slips made a frantic
grab for the leather, and triumphantly waved it
aloft. “How’s that?” Umpire couldn’t tell—grass too
long. Much argument, and a free fight threatened.
Someone said, “Oh, toss for it.” Agreed. “Heads .von
stay'. Tails you sit on the fence. Up she goes.” “Tails.”
Right. Out. Then the scorer dots it down : “Jimmy
Pannikin, tossed out, bowled A. William Cann—o.”

The “Football Accountant” has become an
institution in Britain. He conducts his business, as the
ordinary turf Abraham does, in Flushing, Holland, and
floods the U.K. with his advts. He is, of course, the
ordinary sort of philanthropist, but his special brand of
charity is to accommodate the punter who desires to lose
his money' by backing his fancy football team. One
Doyle advertises that in this business he paid out £lO,OOO
odd for one week; though, certainly, one Bert Fry
responds that he is willing to pay £lO,OOO to any charity
if the other “ accountant” can prove that he isn’t a liar.

IN
BANANA LAND
Charters Towers, which has to look at its
pennies these days, is being tempted to extra-
vagance by a ha’penny paper, the Daily Tele-
graph. Lance Fallow, editor and manager, was
at one time on Rockhampton’s Daily Record,
and is the father of one or two books of verse.
Ihe Telegraph claims that it is the first half-
penny sheet in Australia, which it isn’t, by the
way. Twenty years ago Bendigo had one.
Tolmie, Queensland’s new Minister for
Agriculture, is a man of stout, bulky build and of
very stout, bulky political principles. Although
Tory at heart, he had the honor of putting
the match to the powder magazine which bit w
up Philp in 1903. His constituents, disappointed
at not getting a railway, bade him cross the floor
of the House. He did so and broke up Philp.
it was his one lapse into Radicalism, and he can
honestly plead he was kicked into it.
Died at Laidley George Hunter Wilde,
pioneer of Clermont and Peak Downs
rushes. He chased luck on those disappointing
fields when C. H. Buzacott was catching the
nimble advt. for the Peak Downs paper, and when
the Gold Commissioner was Griffin, the notorious
gentleman who presently murdered the gold escort
which he was pretending to protect through
dangerous country. Wilde subsequently tried
Maoriland, but did no good. He had seen service
in tile Crimea and the Baltic, and carried a wound
to back up his narrative.
Attorney-General Tom O’Sullivan has
“ taken silk ” —the fourth Queensland barrister to
do it in the last year or so. He got his first acquaint-
ance with Costs nearly 40 years ago in the office
of C. F. Chubb, of Ipswich, father of Supreme
Court Justice Chubb. In 1900 he gave up being
a Gent One, and took to wearing horse-hair and a
black night-gown. He has had a curious political
career. He didn’t begin it till 1903; but he has
been a Minister almost every minute since—
sometimes in one House, sometimes in the other ;
it’s all one to “Tommy.”
The Fat of Bananaland left off cursing
Socialism one day last week and cursed “The
Queensland Liberal Fund” instead. The trustees
and secretary of that cheerful concern sent a “ pri-
vate andconfidential” letter to the manager or head
of every company and firm of consequence announ-
cing that, “ it being necessary to protect ourselves
against Socialistic legislation, we have endeavored
to estimate fairly the proportion we fee! justified
in asking you to contribute, and it has been fixed
at —per annum.” But the blank wasn’t left
blank ; it was usually filled in with a figure so pre-
cipitous that the recipient probably said in most
cases “Infernal cheek !” and plugged the docu-
ment into the rubbish-basket. In some cases as
much as £l5O was “fixed”; in plenty of others
£5O. By this time the “ Liberal Fund ” has
realised that it not only opened its mouth wide,
but also put both its hind feet into the cavity.
Water hyacinth, which has murdered the
hopes of the Bremer and the Upper Brisbane
Rivers, has poked its nose into the Fitzroy. For
many years, a bit of a lagoon near Rockhampton
has been the pest’s wet-nurse; but the local
authorities were too tired to bother about it. The
last flood put a new face on things, and now the
hyacinth is in a lot of places where it used not to
be ; and a scared Harbor Board has declared war.
A weird humor exuberates in the northern
end of Bananaland. The other day some Cairns
ratepayers wanted to call attention to an ob-
trusive drain. Instead of sending the council the
usual formal remonstrance and petition they for-
warded an invitation to a “stink party,” and
promised a programme including: Song—“Oh,
that Gorgonzola cheese, it hangs its head ” ; song
—“The cows are in the clover; thank God it’s
not the drain”; recitation—“ When tourists
pass the office they wear clothes-pegs on their
beaks.”
The Bananaland Government lately ap-
pointed Dr. Eleanor Bourne medical inspector of
schools; now Miss Neilson, at one time of the
Brisbane General Hospital, and afterwards of a
Yankee repairing shop, has been appointed nurse
to work in conjunction with Dr. Bourne. Strange
how Governments which hate even the thought of
Socialism practise the thing that will burst the
marriage-tie, play the deuce with the birth-rate,
and create chaos generally. And after it has
practised the dreadful thing it invariably looks
round and waits for the applause.
TRIBULATIONS OF THE TRACK.
CASUAL PEDESTRAIN: “ I suppose you suffer many hardships at times? ”
THE UNQUENCHABLE ONE: “My oath! There's places where it takes yer a week to get to a pub.”
Deakin was particularly emphatic in Bris-
bane on the point that the proposals to go to the
referenda are “ violations of the spirit of the Con-
stitution." Even Brisbane Telegraph pours ice-
cold water on Alfred’s red-hot indignation by
asking him how much he cared for violations of
the spirit of the Constitution when he attempted
to make the 255. financial arrangement a fetter on
the Federation in perpetuity.
The re-arrangemenfc of the Queensland
Ministry has naturally raised up fresh discontents
to plot against the peace of Premier Denham.
Forsyth, Petrie and Rankin are notoriously not
the happiest of men over the allotment of port-
folios, and their presence in next session’s divisions
cannot be depended on. The Government will
make big efforts to capture Blair and Douglas
when the House meets.
Bananaland papers discover that, for a
change, there is not one Scotchman in the present
State Ministry. As a matter of fact, Minister
Grant was born in Scotland, but was caught young
and translated to Australia. After experiencing
Caledonian bosses in Mcllwraith, Hugh Nelson,
Philp and Kidston, Queensland might be forgiven
for changing the brand. Denham is plain
“Zumerzet.” After next election his party will
be plain Mud.
A deputation of State school-teachers
pointed out to Minister Grant recently the
utterly unreliable character of many of the im-
ported text books. One “ geography ” issued last
year described Brisbane as a city frequently de-
vastated by floods, and asserted that large numbers
of Kanakas were still imported into Queensland,
while “ 9000 Chinese are employed in the mines.”
The Kanaka allusion indicates that the foreign
text bocik is only 10 years behind the times—a sur-
prising up-to-dateness, comparatively speaking.

QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. March 18, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Preparations for Coronation month are pro-
ceeding steadily, and Brisbane is looking forward
to a June chock-full of gaiety. Government
House is safe for a ball and garden party, and the
City Fathers are said to have awakened to the
tintinnabulation of George’s coming glory-day.
Possibly they, too, will “come down handsome.”
Some 15 months ago the Macgregor packed his
sporran, burgoo boiler and other household utensils
and moved out of old Government House, which
had been commandeered as Brisbane’s first Uni-
versity building. Last week he returned to acclaim
his erstwhile roof-tree as the higher branch of the
tree of knowledge, and to welcome to its shelter
some 60 students. His Ex. - expressed regret
that the English language was tending more or
less to become the language of the world, the
regret being based on the ground that it was the
most unscientific of all languages. At the same
time headmitted that it supplied toother nations a
great many words in politics, sport and commerce.
No examples were quoted, but doubtless his Ex.
was mentally applying to politics such words as
“State Frights,” which have become a reproach
in all languages; to sport, “stoush,” “crooks,”
“ ticktackers ” and “mugs”; to commerce,
“fakes,” “Fat,” and “anti-sosb.” In conclusion,
his. Ex. expressed the hope that the students
would be taught the habit of observation, which
is a pious wish of my own, believing as I do, my
dear, that the habit of observation in the Com-
monwealth will lead to the habit of nationalism.
_ The death of Speaker Bell allowed Kidston to
fire off his stock obituary remark. For about the
thousandth time he declared “ that the State
would be distinctly the poorer for the sad event.”
Hugh Nelson, Labor-man Brown, and Rockhamp-
ton’s Blair all got the same send-off.
I have determined to be a distinguished citizen
and to travel. All you’ve got to do is to wear an
elastic smile, talk freely of “ this beautiful coun-
try of yours” within the gates of the stranger,
and look gracious when being fed. I picked up
the recipe at a luncheon party given a few days
ago in honor of the Maoriland Wards. W. W.
Hood acted as host and referee, and personally
conducted lou and the ladies who share his
joys around the city.
Miss Violet Baldwin is going to say “I will”
to Dr. Fox, of Mitchell, on the 25th, and in cele-
bration of the event her friends baked a festive
scone and invited her to make herself at home.
She did. The same thing occurred at Mrs.
Seppelt’s jolly sunflower party, and at other
species of revel inaugurated by Mrs. J. S. Wiley
and Miss Dath.
More trippers. The Ross Munros, of Boom-
bah and elsewhere, are leaving by the Otway to
coronate. Recently Mrs. L’Estrange tea’d a
number of the Best in their honor. There is
going to be a dearth of hostesses this year; the
departure of Mesdames Munro, Cecil Palmer,
Harry Cohen and C. Holmes a’Court will mean
a big shrinkage in private entertaining.
The Cowlishaw sisters (Mrs. de Little and Hilda
Cowlishaw) left last week for America. They
have a weakness for Uncle Sam. having already
spent more than one holiday visiting the gentle-
man who has one eagle eye fixed on Canada and
the other on the übiquitous Jap.
The Mary fund is not a healthy business,
although the vice-regal Marys are working over-
time ; but what can you do when the unresponsive
Mary simply gushes : “ What a charming idea ' ”
and forgets to open the Peggy bag! Various
mayoresses are living in perpetual fear that Ladv
Mac will ask about the total.
Society rolled up strongly to Ascot on the 17th
™ f *! ock,n f? looked v ery end of-seasony.
Mabel Brady, in a frock of Coronation blue crepe
de-cnine, must nave been conscious of the cold
tinge of feminine jealousy in the atmosphere.
auu a^es k bride, Mrs. Brodie (she was a Miss
Abbot, of your parts), looked exceedingly well in
a blue and khaki-striped linen.
Arthur Morgan, President of the Council, goes
to Sydney this week, and much interest centres
in his going. He is the man whose lasting am-
bition it is to be the first native-born Governor of
Queensland. With the present Government in
power he doesn’t seem to carve as much ice as he
did with the now politically-dead Kidston ; but
the Denham party may need the hand of help ere
long, and Arthur has before now extended a kindly
fin at the time it would do most good.
A Melbourne correspondent tells me that Mrs.
Arthur and Miss M. Feez have arrived there in
search of frocks, hats and cool weather. Lately
they have been in Maoriland. In Melbourne they
will pick up Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, whose singing
voice will be heard twice ere she packs it up for
Brisbane a week hence. By the way, in a con-
fection which appeared through a haze of tur-
quoise ninon, and was shaded with a Gains-
borough-like head-piece, the Wilson lady was
remarkable among much fine feathered birds at the
Australian Cup meeting.
Mrs. William Collins with the family and the
car returned to us from Tasmania by the Otway.
The human section of the party looked as if the
apple diet were a thing to be sought after and
greatly cherished.
Lieutenant G. A. H. Curtis, our Naval Com-
mandant, has been lieutenant on the Bananaland
gunboat Gayundah for the last 12 years. For a
couple of years before that he was captain of the
Government steamer Merrie England, and in the
dim remoteness of history he was with the
A.U.S.N. Co. Even more remotely he was in
the British Navy. So he’s no water-chicken.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.

Western Champion, one of Bananaland’s
staunch Conservatives, deals thus with Premier
Denham’s assertion that sectarianism influenced
the Rockhampton election :
The Labor party takes no stock of what a man’s
religion is, the Catholics voting just as freely for a Wes-
leyan parson as for a Roman Catholic and vice versa. It
is the other crowd who raise sectarian cries.
And the Champion ought to know.


THE GREAT AMALGAMATION
THE FINAL STORY OF HAWKINS HILL.
What This Amalgamation Means.
IT MEANS one mine, one mill, one main shaft, one main tunnel,
one manager, one board of directors, one general staff. In
1870-1-2-3 Hawkins Hill had 50 or more mines, with 50 managers,
with as many shafts, and tunnels, and boards of directors, offices and staffs. El Dorado
itself would have broken down under such a weight. It means a working capital of
170,000 for the deeper development of Hawkins Hill, once capitalised at about 12,000,000,
when the working capital was usually nil. In this combination there will be no restraint
of trade, and no cut-throat competition. It will deal only in gold, at a fixed and
unalterable price. It is a combination without monopoly, a union without blacklegging.
There are hundreds of letters about it, some having this phrase: “It is what N.S. Wales
has been many years waiting for.” These letters would make an interesting book, but a
few sentences culled from the heap must suffice: Christian Knoblanche describes Scantle-
bury as the new Moses, and threatens him with a statue. Joseph Vickery, brother of
the late Ebenezer Vickery, who ran a public mill in the boom, wants to get into mining
harness. Advancing years have no terrors for Joseph. He had a retort made to hold a
ton of gold. Anticipations, first laughed at, were realised in the filling of that retort
several times. Then the Vickerys laughed.
William Pullen, of Woolgoolga, claims to have erected the first battery, and crushed
Beyers and Holtermann’s specimen, with about 10 tons of other stone, for 11,000 ounces.
Dellow, last week, thrilled Charters Towers through The Miner with his Hawkins Hill
yarn as a mill-man. Spence, an Adelaide metallurgist, points out where big gold chances
are in three claims on the Hill, and is anxiously waiting to get back. Several pioneers
talk of the great service to N.S. Wales and have thrown big national bouquets.
Young Holtermann wishes to have “All the gold left in Dad’s claim.” Louis
Beyers’ sons write from a Westralian field that they are only waiting for news of success
to make a bee-line back to Hill End
Many fine yarns relating to the boom time of Hawkins Hill have come in. We can
only give the latest. A Hill End pioneer now living in a Sydney suburb states that one
day, seeing a notice at the Post Office inviting tenders for driving a tunnel, without any
particulars of situation or nature of rock, he put in a tender at £lO a foot, and, to his
surprise, got the contract. Again, to his surprise, he found the ground only worth £3 a
foot, and consequently made £3O to £4O a week. Suddenly the tunnel came on to some
old workings which contained many bags of stone of amazing richness. The reef was
already bagged, and the contract closed, the contractor being satisfied with a bonus of
75 sovereigns. As he puts it, it was quite clear that the object of the tunnel had been
fulfilled.,
It is for you to wonder how these bags of gold got there, and if there are any others.
Another: —Several rich claim-holders thought it would be a good idea to build a
primitive flying fox to convey stone to the public mill. It was such a crude hauling
arrangement that the buckets used to jamb at the spreaders and against each other in
passing, with the result that many rich buckets of stone were upset and rolled down the
hill into the mullock dump. It was only when the bonanzas left that the miners became
more careful.
A third, and last: —One man writes that it was his custom to wait for the hour of
midnight on Saturday, when the public batteries ceased working on the striking of the
town clock, and the ravines of the Turon would reverberate with the music of the dollies,
which within a few minutes would also stop. For the hour had struck, and then silence
would brood over the primeval wilderness.
These are fair average grab-samples from the parts of the Commonwealth where the Hill
End pioneers and their sons drifted after the disappearance of the bonanzas. Hill End
seems to exercised over its pioneers the same weird fascination that the wild has
for its children, and the Poles have for the adventurers who have tried to penetrate their
secrets. The longing to get back is never absent, and breaks out in strange ways. And
that Hill End should do so is easily understandable. The history of the Hill is as
romantic as a fairy tale. This field was first unique in its wondrous richness ; it was
unique in its utter abandonment, unique in its long period of quiescence, and it is
certainly unique in the manner of its resurrection. Never did a mining promoter appear
before the public of Australia with such a story. In effect, Scantlebury says: “I have
consolidated the claims of what was once the richest gold-area in the- -world. We want
£70,000 to develop and work it properly. I have proved beyond all doubt that there is
payable gold there, and there is always a chance of striking fresh bonanzas. It is not
a gamble in which investors stand to lose their money before gold is struck. Gold will be
won from the first day the mill starts. Gold is being won now 7 . A return on the
money is assured, and the only gamble is on the chance of development bringing to light
more bonanzas, such as made the field so famous in the years a-rear.” And there are
scattered over Australia men, young and old, hungry to get back to Hill End,, and, like
N.S.W. in respect to this amalgamation, “they have been waiting for this for years.”
They believe that Hill End will come again with the same fiery faith with which the early
Christians believed in the return of their Messiah.
It was this universal and trustful waiting that inspired Scantlebury to investigate
the field. It prompted the N.S.W. Government, a decade or more ago, to propose the
largest gold-mining subsidy ever offered —£30,000. This subsidy was for the deep and
modern development of Hawkins Hill, and was withdrawn because, in the absence of
amalgamation, the conditions covering the offer could not be complied with. Now that
these disabilities have been removed, it is only reasonable to assume that the subsidy will
be renewed. Not for the exclusive benefit of Amalgamated Hill End, but for the greater
permanent development of the field of which the amalgamated area is a part.
Mr. Pittman, N.S.W. Government Geologist, puts the position of Hill End in a nut-
shell in his book, “The Mineral Resources of N.S. Wales.” Space does not permit of a
wholesale extract from this work, but on page 32 he writes:
“Probably no other field in New South Wales offers such legitimate inducements
for the investment of capital as Hawkins Hill. It is true that comparatively
barren stone has succeeded the extraordinary rich ore which was worked in 1872,
but this is only what must be expected in all mines where gold occurs in chutes.
What is required is systematic prospecting, at greater depths, for a recurrence of
the rich deposits, and it is extraordinary that such a length of time has been
allowed to elapse without any attempt to carry out this prospecting.”
That is what this company proposes to do. Mr. Pittman’s statement was published
in 1900, and since that date the tunnel has been extended into the auriferous channel,
levels and old workings have been cleaned out, and the mill at the mouth of the tunnel
has been used in testing different working faces and stopes. The shafts having collapsed,
it was only by extension of this tunnel that anything could be seen. To-day this has
been proved beyond doubt: —That reefs and different working faces abandoned in the
’7o’s as unpayable are more than payable to-day, so that Amalgamated Hill End starts
as a payable gold-producing mine. It is not a prospect—true it has the prospect of
getting again on to the bonanzas and making the world ring as aforetime; but otherwise
it is a mining certainty, and not a gamble in the ordinary mining sense.
Let a comparison be made between the big defined gold belt of Hawkins Hill and
that of Lucknow, some 3U miles away. At Hill End there are a number of gold-bearing
reefs in a belt of country many hundred feet wide. Some of these reefs, in a length of
less than 2000 feet, and within 400 feet of the surface, produced over 20 tons of gold —and
some of the reefs in the Amalgamated area have never been worked. At Lucknow there
is one narrow channel. It is a contact reef, or vein, running between two distinct
country rocks, diorite on one side, and serpentine on the other. There is only one thing to
do, follow the joint. Sometimes the two rocks close, and there is no reef or gold.
Sometimes the rocks open, and the space is filled with quartz and calcite, without gold,
and at other times it is full of gold. But get away from that contact and there is no hope.
At Hill End there are some 20 distinct reefs.
At Lucknow some tons of gold have be,en produced from this contact vein. Like Hill End,
it was shut down for years, and, like Hill End will be to-morrow, it was re-opened some
15 years ago by a company having a strong working capital. Unlike Amalgamated Hill
End shareholders, that company had only the prospect of a recurrence of bonanzas,
yet before the money, £35,000, was spent, they got one, and for many months Lucknow
produced on an average nearly half a ton of gold per month. In time the riches gave
out. All booms and bonanzas are short-lived. That is why gold is over £4 per ounce. At
Lucknow they wearied of following the contact without result. There was nothing else
to prospect, so Lucknow is shut down to-day. Hill End shut down because it could not;
carry the burden of £2,000,000 capital without working capital, without mills, with
claims 20 and 120 feet long. They would not amalgamate when they were rich, and an
asinine mining law prevented it long years after they were comparatively poor.
Think of it! Each mine had its own board of directors, its own manager, its
own office in Sydney. It had everything which prevents a 100 feet claim
paying to-day. It had no mill, the one thing that might have
helped to pull it through. These little claims, which had an excess of capital and
too little ground, crushed at the public mills, and paid for the privilege. Next to owning
a rich claim on Hawkins Hill was the possession of a mill.
Then the mullock on the dump, as well as that in the mines, is worth thinking about.
It is proposed to work the old ground by tributors, on such terms that, in the event of
bonanzas being unearthed in that part of the property, the tributors will make fortunes
and the company will get dividends. This part will be cut up into blocks and let to
working parties of four, six and eight. By the old ground Scantlebury means the
immediate vicinity of Krohmann’s ton of gold crushing, Beyers and Holtermann’s speci-
men, which Mr. Pittman describes as “the largest mass of gold ever found”; Paxton’s
Claim, which yielded 4200 ounces from two tons of stone ; Brown’s, which gave two tons
of gold, and had less than 30 feet of ground; and many other rich claims.
The company’s operations will be the extension of the tunnel further east, to cut
unworked reefs, where anything is possible; to clean out the Star of Peace shaft, and to
see if, as reported by the manager before he closed down, in one cross-cut there are 14
gold-bearing veins in less than 40 feet of ground. The Company will drive a main tunnel
lower down the hill, and, if necessary, sink a new main shaft. At any rate, with its
solid working capital, with its payable ore faces, with its tens of thousands of tons of
mullock in the stopes, and an impoverished heap on the surface, it must make a name for
itself, and dividends for its shareholders.
Already the map of the Amalgamated Hill End shareholders is that of Austra-
lasia. They cover, it is safe to say, a wider range than any other Australian gold
mine, not excepting Mt. Morgan in Queensland, the Great Boulder in Westralia, or
the Waihi in Maoriland, from which Dominion applications have come because The
Bulletin of three weeks ago got there. Already there are hundreds of shareholders,
and there will probably be over 1000 before allotment takes place. There are poli-
ticians and policemen—amongst the first are three ex-State Premiers, amongst the
.latter are men who were born at Hill End. There are clergymen, and bishops
are expected. Altogether, there is undoubted evidence that this project is a long-waited-for
development. The fact most significant is the application of some big gold mine
managers. One, a front-ranker, too, has offered to throw up his position to manage
Hill End, at a less salary, because of the name he believes he is bound to make there
for himself.
The list is not full, a fact that is usually concealed, or at least disguised, in
promotions. But it is not in this. That is the reason why the time for receiving applica-
tions has been extended till the end of March. For Queensland and West Australia it
is extended to Bth April. And the announcement is made that all share applications
posted on or before those dates will be accepted.
Like all other things this promotion will be judged by results. So far the results
are: tha.t there are upwards of 500 shareholders; that the great bulk of the applications
have come through the company’s office, and that several prominent mining and financial
leaders are ready to become directors.
There is an impression abroad that the share list is full. Every day wires ask: “Is
it too late to apply for shares?” About 100 applications below the minimum—so
shares —cannot be accepted. Yet the fact remains that the list is not yet filled. If you
think it should be, fill in the application form.
Applications will close on March 31 in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and on April 8 in
Queensland and West Australia, and all applications posted on or before those dates will be accepted.

EXPECTED BABY

CURE BY CUTICURA

old. She was in an
awful mess all over
her body. We never
thought she would
get over it. We sat
with her night and
day for about a month,
expecting every min-
ute to see her die. The
doctor gave me an
ointment to rub her
with but it did her no
good. My mother was
home from America
and she told me to try
Cuticura Ointment
and to wash her with
Cutioura Soap. There was a great
difference when I used the first box.
It seemed to soothe her and she slept.
I used three boxes of Cuticura Ointment
and she was quite cured. She has the
§urest skin and is the fattest baby now!
he is a miracle, the doctor declares.
I am glad to tell anybody about it.

AN EMPEROR S APPRECIATION.
The Emperor of Austria has conferred a unique
distinction, as also has the Vienna Chamber of
Science conferred its highest award, upon Dr.
Scheuble, of Vienna, for his discovery of
“Samol,” a treatment for Rheumatism, Gout,
Lumbago, Sciatica, and kindred ailments. So
effective is this treatment that pain is relieved
within a few seconds of its application, and the
poisonous causes of these ailments rapidly
neutralised and eliminated.
As soon as the necessary arrangements can be
made, “Samol ” will be obtainable from all chem-
ists ; in the meanwhile, in order to allow sufferers
to test the efficacy of this great discovery, it can
be obtained, price 3/9 and G/- per tube, post free,
from the representative of Dr. Scheuble—H. A.
Goddard, Eagle St., Brisbane ; or H. A. Goddard,

There is no epidemic or disease which destroys so

The blood is burned out by the nicotine or tobacco
poison; the nerves are shattered, and heart and brain
lose all power and become, in 99 per cent, of cases,

The Inky Way.
“Penman”: A correspondent, who smells of tin
white choker, with all its potentiality of malice, its
inward breathing, quivering malignity, says that the
journalist who cannot compete with the parson
ought to break stones or kill pigs. All very well,
Mr. Choker. I am prepared to fight you fair, and
see who has to pig-stick ; but 1 object to your com-
peting against me, in my poor trade, with your han-
dicap of about £5 a week, gotten from your
dupes. With that £5 a week subsidy, of course
White Choker can afford to work at half my rate.
There was a poor broom-maker, who stole the
bristles and the sticks, but he could not rival the
fellow who stole the brooms ready-made. So he
had to pig-stick. Seriously, this clerical jobbery
is a tremendous scandal. White Choker dare not
open a hay and corn store, grocery, or boot-shop.
Mrs. Grundy would be on to him if he only broke
stones or stuck pigs. So he has to sneak into news-
paper offices by night, Nicodemus-like. I say that,
with his bread and butter ecclesiastically cut safely,
he takes bread out of the mouths of the children of
poor journalists. The work of the Lord Jesus
Christ only needs the fag-end of his mighty mind ;
the other part he gives to the writing of leading
articles for half a crown.
The new Labor paper, the Maori land Worker,
which was started about the middle of 1910 as an
experiment by the Shearers’ Union, has been form-
ally taken over by the M.L. Federation of Labor,
and, pending the installation of new machinery,
will be printed and published to order in Welling-
ton, instead of Christchurch, as hitherto. R. S.
Ross, formerly editor of the Barrier Truth, Broken
Hill, and latterly editor of the Melbourne Socialist,
has been appointed to the controlling chair. Ros;
learned his Labor politics in Queensland.
* # * #
“Wonga”: Whatever the outcome of the row be-
tween the two newspaper cliques, a lot of solid good
can be done by union. While the matter of pay may
be difficult to work on practical lines, the coin is
not everything. There is, for instance, the question
of annual holidays. On the big dailies a fortnight
is the rule. It’s not enough. The press hack works
all usual holidays—Christmas, Easter, etc. They
are about his hardest times, mostly. Yet the de-
spised bank clerk snares all these, and still takes
his fortnight; sometimes three weeks. And daily
journalism is about the most strenuous game going
these times. Pressmen should stick out for at least
a longer furlough; and they won’t do it by each
standing on his own manure heap. Likewise, the
one-time rule of a clear week night off should be
revived, as well as Sunday or the equivalent. That
is one day in the seven. The curse of journalism
now is the unceasing grind. Another advisable
resurrection —that a man should not have to take
an assignment before mid-day if he has been work-
ing after midnight. Here are three practical reforms
worth while. To grant them would not cost any
properly-staffed office a bean, and probably such de-
mands would be granted, if properly brought .for-
ward. But no single journalist is going to ring
the bell. Union is necessary, and it strikes the
writer that blackguarding the other crowd is not
going to do either any good. If nothing better can
be done, “office committees,” representing the staffs,
could bring forward such requests effectively. These
committees might do more good, for that matter,
than hanging on to an Arbitration Court. Demo-
cratic and all as they may be, the average pressman
is not keen on Trades Hall methods.
“Ganesha”: After studying the remarks of
“Hassan,” Mutch, etc., on. the Journalistic Asso-
ciation, I would like to know where the writer
comes in. “Hassan” refers lightly to the casual
writer, classifying him with that monstrous hybrid,
the “trade artist,” and the unpromising “junior” :
but the only scribe who really counts in a civilised
community is this “casual writer.” A journalist
is a “trade writer,” and, like an English butler,
should know his place. Literature matters; jour-
nalism does not matter. In h'is professional capacity,
a pressman, who is only a fact-monger, has no more
to do with the craft of writing than a lawyer’s
clerk. The unions seem to regard literature as a
side-line; to the majority of journalists it probably
is. But even in a backward place like London,
news-getting, reports, etc., are done by machinery.
There are special factories or agencies for this sort
of dreary labor, which holds the same relationship
to literature as hod-carrying to architecture. In
our advanced cities this is the daily scribe’s chief
occupation. “Hassan” seems to hold the same
theory of values as the naive Mr. Beeby, who wanted
to know “where the reporters were,” as if it
mattered where they were. One would think that
the further away were the men who are responsible
for, let us say, the reports of the theatres, tne
better. If Australia is going to develop any litera-
ture, apart from the reports of cricket and divorce
cases, imbecile leaders and incompetent criticism,
the existence of the writer who is not an “able
reporter ” will have to be made less casual than it
is. “Hassan,” the writer of stories, is much more
important than “Hassan,” an ornament of the daily
paper. lurnalism is killing literature, for the
most promising Australian writers have to go either
to the Sydney Morning Herald or to London. Brady,
I believe, drew up an elaborate document to attack
this evil, but the writers, unfortunately, were so
casual that they lost it. It is for the unions now
to make good. What is their proposition, if any?
* * * *
“Peter Pickle”: When I was a boy I was taught
that one day a poor criminal was being led to execu-
tion. Sir Philip Sidney and a friend were passing,
and Sidney said to his friend: “There, but for the
grace of God, goes Philip Sidney.’ On February 18,
Attorney-General Hughes, writing in Sydney D.T.,
observed: “ ‘But for the grace of God,’ said John
Wesley to his friend, as they gazed upon a poor
wretch, cowering in the tumbril, on his way to be
hanged, ‘there go you and I. ” By a curious co-
incidence, the writer of an editorial in the S. M.
Herald on the same date, attributed the “but for
the grace of God” remark to John Bunyan. Since
then, nine separate correspondents have saddled
the fatuous old remark on nine different celebrities,
-all of whom.are corpses, and consequently unable to
deny - the charge. Who really was the original
snuffler? It may be that a century hence someone
will credit it to Billy Hughes himself.
* * * *
A queer case, instancing the dogged fashion in
which Lord Northcliffe (who was Alfred Harms-
worth) fights those who cross him, is pending in
London. Some months ago three Tory M’s.P.
started a halfpenny sheet, called Evening Times,
and snared two of Harmsworth’s men—Charles
Watney and John Cowley. Whereupon Harmsworth
fared as far afield as Glasgow, dug up a little paper
called The Evening Times, and sooled it on to
the London Evening Times. The Glasgow journal
asks for an injunction to restrain the London one
from calling itself Evening Times, and likewise for
damages. And whether it wins or not, the new
London venturers in for a massive bill of Costs.
THE BELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Above the church across the way
They’ve hung a brand-new bell of late,
And —morning, noon and even—they
Its copper clapper agitate,
While in a lialf-deinented state,
And fit for all the blackest crimes,
I hunt the dim, illusive rhymes.
On Sunday, which is set apart
For poems that may deeply stir
The adamantine public heart,
They make the monster hum and whir,
Till neighbors gather to aver
The devil that bell fashioned, lest
Poor man should know a day of rest.
The bell is ringing now. Its din
A trickle of good people draws,
And drives a mighty throng to sin,
Who swear and curse with not a pause,
Until the mind a picture draws
Of hundreds flocking into Hell
Dragged thither by the clanging bell!

WHY YOU CAN TRUST MY
FREE CIGAR
TRIAL
/S
ohm
ALMOST everybody knows about my eftorts
to make Cigar-smoking popular in Aus-
tralia.
My FREE CIGAR TRIAL is this:—l’ll send
you a box of too DIADEMAS for 22/6 —equal, as
they are, to any 6d. Cigar on the market; really
worth £2 ss, per too—and you can smoke sor 6
of them. If they aren't as good as any Cigar
you have ever tried, send the remainder back to
me, and I’ll refund your money in full, without
any charge for those you’ve smoked.
fh
fgh
Now, I want to prove to
you how straight this offer is.
You might think —“Why
doesn’t he send the box up
without any monfiy, and let
us send the money on when
we’ve tried the 5 or 6 and
found them as good as he
says, or else return the
balance then ?”
I tell you right off, I’d like
to do that, lint 1 hat would
put all the, trusting on my
side—and I've got to make a
living.
I know nearly every man-
jack of you would act straight
tome if I did make this offer.
But you know as well as I
there are some who would
get the Cigars, and let me
whistle for the money.
I know there'd be only a
few who would do this; but
I sell my Cigars so close Jo
cost —cutting off all the ware-
houseman's, traveller's and
retailer’s profits—that these
few would cripple my scheme
altogether. That’s why ,1
can't do it and give the same
Cigar as I give to-day.
I know you’re trusting me
in sending <}own the money
before you get the Cigars.
But ypu’jl get the Cigars
right by return post, never
fear, You can smoke sor 6
of them, and if they’re not
as good as you expected,
you can send what are left
right back. I’ll return your money —every
petfif of it, with no deduction whatever—
and even here you needn’t only take my word
for ijti
I Jiave my banking account at the Com-
mercial Dank of Australia Limited, Melbourne.
The (general Manager there knows all about
me ahd my way of doing business. He 11 vouch
fpr me; and you can refer to him before you
send any order at all to me. That s proof of my
squareness, isn’t it?
Sit down now and send me 22/6 to-day, and
I'll forward you a box of 100 DIADEMAS—
Cigars that I promise are equal to any 6d.

GUN TRIAL
Have you ever noticed that the more rub-
bishy a gun is, the more you are pressed by
sellers of the swindle to take it on trial for
a week, fortnight, or month, or whatever
the stated time may be ? They know well
enough that if the gun has gone through the
proof-house, it will stand ordinary charges
for at least that time. The trial amounts
to absolutely nothing. Any cheap D.B. gun,
costing about 15s. at the works, will shoot
for that time, and probably shoot well too,
but then they soon begin to show the cloven
hoof. 1 The cast-iron, parts, polished to look
like steel, can’t stand the strain much longer,
and shakes, misfires, broken pins come along.
Then commences the long bill for repairs,
and the disgust of the victim, who has paid
perhaps 50s. to £lO for what is nothing but
a heap of scrap. The only trial that is any
good to you is one that lasts for years,
covered by a signed guarantee against break-
down or repairs. This is the sort of guaran-
tee we give with our “Dreadnought” gun—
for two years. This means two years’ actual
personal trial given with a high-grade Eng-
lish-made and proved gun for £6 6s. A
gun that will give you a lifetime of good
shooting. Send to-day for catalogue and
particulars.

wrote: —“ It is with gratitude I write this testimonial. My
son was subject to fits for 16 years. I tried every known
remedy and all the doctors of repute in this city, but
without any success. I was advised to try Trench’s
Remedy, and from the first dose he has not had the sign
of a fit, that is now four years last October. He can go
about anywhere; before we dared not let him out of our
sight. I have recommended the Remedy to several sufferers
from this terrible complaint, and with successful results.”

Bibenduvis Tyre Lectures .
No. 2.
Regarding the rear wheels
of your car—the wheels upon which the greater weight is thrown, and which
bear the driving strain—there can be no question that a pair of
Non-skids
are the safest tyres—even as they are the best non-skids—with which you can
fit them.
These covers—fitted with solid steel studs, projecting well above the tread,
their bases deeply embedded in the rubber —ensure a firm hold on the greasiest
surface.
Additional strength and support are afforded by a band of stout chrome leather,
which renders the tread practically unpuncturable, while it extends far enough up
the walls to provide ample protection —but not far enough to interfere with the
resiliency of the cover or to deprive it of ventilation.
It is their lasting efficiency that sets Michelin Non-skids in a class by themselves. (4)

WARNING. —Don’t buy nichelin Tyres at less than current
prices. They may be of old manufacture. Purchase only
from our Agents.

who were restored to health
by Bile Beans.
“ Bile Beans Quickly Cured Us.”
“Both myself and husband have derived the
greatest possible benefits from Bile Beans,”
says Mrs. Burr, residing in Pinkenba, via
Brisbane, Q., “and we have kept them as our
general family medicine for years.
“I myself was afflicted with terrible stomach
and liver trouble. I used to experience the
most agonising pains in the region of the liver,
spasms caused through wind in the stomach,
and vomiting. Life to me became nothing but
a misery, and I was forced to employ someone
to carry on my household duties. I consulted
doctors, but the treatments prescribed failed to
restore me to health, and I can assure you I
was in a pretty bad way when I decided to see
if Bile Beans would do me any good. They
proved the remedy I had been long seeking, for
Bile Beans quickly relieved me of all pain,
rid me of the wind, , and toned up my system
admirably.
“My husband suffered from a severe attack
of windy spasms, and I thought he would have
died with the pain, but a couple of doses of Bile
Beans restored him to the best of health.
“ The excellence of our general health testifies
to the great merits of Bile Beans , and you are
at liberty to use my foregoing testimony for the
benefit of other sufferers, for Bile Beans quickly
cured us.”
The Standard Family Medicine.
At this season if you
feel as if you have no
energy, too weary to
do anything, yet you
cannot sleep at night,
you need Bile Beans.

Matchless for the Complexion.
The Old Head Nurse and the
Young Marchioness.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SAW her first from a painful bed,
Where I lay fresh from a fearful fall,
With a broken leg and a broken head,
In the accident ward of the hospital.
Some women are hard as the Road to Grace,
That natural sinners are doomed to tread,
And as beautiful as a camel’s face ;
But our head nurse was the limit, they said.
You have seen some of the sort, no doubt—
The buck-teeth kind with the three-haired mole.
There are British lady tourists about
(Conducted by Cook from Pole to Pole)—
You’ve felt the blast of their monocle ;
You’ve heard them asking: “What do you
mean ? ”
Had these been gathered together and—well,
Then our head nurse would have been the queen.
She walked like a trestle, with toes turned in,
And she was as gatint as a drought-baked horse.
With big buck-teeth and a downy chin,
And the three-haired mole, and the Nose, of
course.
She had us there where we could not strike,
And she could punish in many ways, too ;
She was hated by nurses and patients alike
But she knew more than the doctors knew.
And they would respectfully wait for her,
In a desperate case where the chance was slim,
To take her place in the “ theatre ’
Of the hospital, with its secrets grim.
Of many a ghastly grapple with death.
When doctors paled, she could tell, no doubt;
Of the hours she fought for the fluttering breath—
Yes ! She knew Mankind, inside and out.
Of course my heart must get broken there
(Though I had a wife and kids in the town),
For a pretty young nurse with auburn hair
And eyes of the deepest, richest brown.
We called the old nurse “ The Hen” (I beg
You’ll pardon me if I stick to fact).
T reckon the head nurse saved my leg,
Though friends declare that my head’s still
cracked.
* * * *
A tragedy fades like the fading scar,
And marks of stitches above your eye;
And I’ve seen much and I’ve travelled far
Since the day when I wished they would let me
die.
“ Back to the World again ! ” . . . Where were we?
Oh, the head nurse! —we called her “The
Hen.” Ah ! well.
Set your stage for a comedy,
For this is “ The Tale of a Hen ” I tell.
I lived in “Thelma,” in Belgrave-street,
Off Belmont Park. ’Twas a good address
When sending a memo, short and sweet
To the editors of a fulsome press.
’Twas a four-roomed shanty, built in a plain
Style of architecture —Australian quKe ;
The local pound was just down the lane—
The Mongolian Gardens were opposite.
We kept a servant, a stunted freak
I caught at a Government Bureau ;
She might have been seventeen last week,
Or six-and-twenty for aught I know ;
She’d been trained backward! (of immigrant
stock—
A midland county—l know no more).
She started each morning at six o’clock
By scrubbing a hole in the kitchen floor.
Intentions excellent. Short of breath.
Our troubles caused her the greatest distress.
She was known to the wife as Elizabeth,
And known to me as “ The Marchioness.”
“ Master’s narrer ” (she meant “ the boss ”),
She’d say to the wife when I could not eat;
“ He’s nearly as narrer as father was ;
I wish that master would take his meat.”
She never could understand at all
That this was the Land of Democracy.
She’d bully the “tradesmin,” great and small,
Till those sons of freedom appealed to me.
They had to “go round to the kitching door,”
Butcher and baker, and “ Milk,” no less,
A thing that they never had done before ;
But they all were afraid of the Marchioness.
You could always tell what she was thinking
about,
That red-haired weed with a heart of gold.
When the duns came round and “master” was
out,
She’d spar like a good ’un without being told.
Empress or peasant, collie or cur,
Heart of a female it’s hard to tell;
I fancy we must have been kind to her,
Or she wouldn’t have stuck to us so well.
The sledge-hammer force of simplicity
And truth was hers, by an ancient right;
Hard, practical kindness and sympathy,
And a great love somewhere—but out of sight.
Kiddiesobeyed her ; and, what is niore,
They loved her and came to her early and late ;
And she’d dole out alms at her “ kitching ” door
With the air of a Dame at her castle gate.
They never come singly, to palace or tent,
Twins or troubles or human ills ;
And I think that, wherever a man pays rent,
The same thing mostly applies to bills.
And so, one Monday, when all behind
With the rent (or ahead of it, which you will),
And the butcher and baker had been unkind —
And a story refused —little Joe fell ill.
The doctor came, and he shook his head,
And he looked at the child for a moment or two.
He listened and nodded to what we said,
And told the wife what she must not do.
He said we must keep the child in bed
(As if we’d stand him outside on his head —
It was bitter cold and ’twas raining too);
And then he wrote aprescription and fled
(A district doctor must earn his screw).
I looked in the kitchen—don’t know for what.
The Marchioness there, with an altered face,
Was hurriedly making water hot
In every kettle and pan in the place.
She plucked a rug from her skimpy bed.
And dragged in a tub on the bedroom floor ;
And when I protested, she only said,
“I know it, master —I seen it before.”
The first night’s battle was tough, I guess,
With only hot water and mustard to win it;
The wife and I, and the Marchioness —
I reckon she didn’t let Death begin it.
The doctor came when we’d pulled Joe through-
’Twas a sickly time, and he’d only a minute —
He squinted and sniffed as good doctors do,
And prescribed a hot bath with mustard in it.
Ten o’clock in the morning found
Joe still doubtful, I in distress ;
I was bracing up for the second round—
“ Same time to-night,” said the Marchioness.
I felt that my face was drawn and white. . . .
No doubt you’ll think I’m a womanish one;
But have you ever been up all night
Fighting death for your first-born son l
Or seen your child in convulsions, you chaps ? . . ,
I rose, and I went to the door at last—
To look for the Unexpected perhaps—
And who should I see but “ The Hen ” go past!
In plain dress, too ; but you’d know her walk
If you saw her passing on Paradise track.
’Twas a desperate case—l don’t want to talk—
I was clean knocked out, so I called her back,
She was having a holiday, first in her life.
And “ resting,” of course, on her restless feet;
She was staying a week with her brother’s wife
On the height overlooking Belgrave-street.
That much I gathered ; my wits were slow,
I was faint and ill, and as dull as a dunce ;
But she took charge of the wife and Joe,
And the Marchioness, “Thelma” and me at
once.
The Marchioness looked at the Head Nurse hard ;
And the Head Nurse looked at the Marchioness
(So the wife whispered to me out in the yard);
Why they chummed up at once I never could
guess.
We hadn’t yet told the Head Nurse about
How the Marchioness saved Joe from Paradise;
And down to this hour I could never make out
What those two saw in each other’s eyes.
She packed the pair of us into a room
To sleep for an hour by the Blessed Grace,
And she sent the priestess of our old broom
For a lot of things from her brother’s place.
By hidden signs that were known to men
(And known perhaps to Elizabeth),
And her hardening eyes, I could see “ The Hen ’
Was bracing herself for a scrap with Death.
In the grey of the morning I crept by stealth,
To listen and peep in the passage gloom ;
And the cleverest nurse in the Commonwealth
Was sweeping and dusting the dining-room.
Eyes of a hawk ! She caught me, and said —
“ What do you here in the dead of night?
Get on with your writing or go to bed—
Your wife is asleep, and the boy’s all right.”
Eyes half blinded with—well, ’twas a poor,
Unmanlike, unwriterlike thing to d 0....
I’ve had always a fancy, but couldn’t be sure,
That some of the tears were in her eyes too.
But she'only muttered, “ Confound the man !”
Giving her duster a vicious twirl —
“Go back as quietly as you can,
Elizabeth is asleep, poor girl! ”
(What of you, with your nurseries;
And dainty nurses, as bright as stars ;
And prim, trained maids to attend on these,
And doctors twain in their motor-cars !
Death could tell you—he’s not so bad ;
A good old sport, though he loves his joke—
Of many a harder fight he had
With poverty and the hearts of folk.)
Long years ten, and the Nurse is dead,
Forgotten by hundreds she helped to live.
You gave her her uniform and her bread ;
I gave her a headstone (’twas little to give).
But I want you to know that preachers and pugs,
Doctors and editors (publishers, too !),
Likewise spielers, and also mugs,
And nurses and poets have hearts—like you.
On the fair allotment where “Thelma” stood
A villa’s been standing for quite a while ;
The timber is hard Australian wood,
And it’s built in the new Australian style.
Called “ Thelma ” (Lwonder who she was at all ?).
But one is there, you can easily guess—
A fearsome tyrant, who rules in all,
And she’s known to me as the Marchioness.

Unredeemed Pledges.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SALE of unredeemed pledges !
Dust, crush, raucous voices, a hammer’s
rat-tat, greed and poverty, our commer-
cial civilisation, la bete humaine —such was my
first impression of the scene.
The booth, about the size of a monkey’s cage,
abutted on Pitt-street. One couldn’t miss it. I
was pushed inside.
Flustering landladies, broken-down brokers,
loafers, agents and amateur bargain-hunters
seemed to be the most prominent vultures that
flapped their obscene wings round Isaac Galilee,
the auctioneer. He was a dark, slim, glittering-
eved young man, who put into his funeral oratipn
over the pawnshop wreckage an intensity of rever-
ence that would have done credit to Mark

“That Backache Worries Me.”
How many people suffer constantly from lame, aching backs,
and don’t know why ? Backache is kidney-ache in most cases.
The kidneys (located in the small of the back) ache and throb
with dull pain, because there is a congestion or inflammation
within. You can’t get rid of that ache until you cure the cause —■
the kidneys. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cure sick Kidneys,
and thus drive away backache for good. If it hurts your back to
stoop or lift —if you suffer sudden, darting pains through the
hips, loins and sides, suspect the kidneys. There will be other
signs, too : headaches, dizziness, scanty or painful urination, too
frequent urination, rheumatism, brick-dust sediment in the urine,
nervousness, or a constant tired feeling. Take Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. Thousands have found quick relief and lasting
cures through this famous kidney remedy.
Two Lasting Sydney Cures.
Mr. W. James, Hairdresser and Tobacconist, Manly,
Sydney, says : —“ During the past ten years a statement has
been appearing in the Sydney papers setting forth that Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills had cured me of backache and strength-
ened my kidneys. It is perfectly true ; Doan’s Pills cured me
ten years ago, and I have been perfectly well ever since. Any-
body who suffers with the kidneys should get this remedy at
once, for it will put an end to their suffering. My complete
and lasting cure proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
a thoroughly reliable Kidney remedy.”
Mr. Geo. Hurcum, 63 Campbell Street, Glebe, says:—
“ I strained my back about two and a half years ago, and shortly
afterwards caught a chill, which settled in my back. From
then until quite lately I have been suffering agony with back-
ache. At times the pain was so severe that it was impossible
for me to bend or turn. Hearing of cures effected by Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills I decided to give them a trial. After
taking a course I was perfectly cured, and I have had no return
of the trouble. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a boon to all
who suffer with backache.”

Antony over the dead body of Caesar. Yea,
even if Cassar had been triplets it would have
sufficed.
A boy sat on the threshold, nursing a bell and
sucking an orange. He threw the peel nonchal-
antly into the busy street.
Bicycles, sewing-machines, quilts, tablecloths,
muslin dresses, petticoats, mirrors, toilet-glasses,
sleeve-links, brooches, watches, hairbrushes, china
ornaments, old books, oleographs, and a miscel-
laneous assortment of pathetic pledges, on which,
as an elderly female contemptuously assured the.
bystanders, ss. and under had been lent, stuffed
the tiny booth to the brim, littered the walls,
hung in festoons to the rafters. In rapid succes-
sion they passed on to Isaac’s raised. table.
Nothing was too fine or too ugly, too sacred or
too profane to be dragged from the decent seclu-
sion of the pawnshop shelves into the broad glare
of an auctioneer’s day.
Everything in Heaven and earth, and the
waters beneath the earth seemed to stumble into
pawn, from emu’s eggs to false teeth.
One pound lent for sixpence ! There is a fatal
fascination in that sign. It suggests that some
kind-hearted old gentleman is willing to give you a
shining sovereign for your paltry sixpence. It
looks like taking his money. One wonders, with
a kind of pity, how the philanthropic pawn-
broker can do it. He does, though.
Isaac holds up a fawn-colored overcoat. It is
wan and patchy, but Isaac extols its worth with
passionate conviction.
Was this trusty friend pledged, as by Colline,
the philosopher in “ La Boheme,” for the sake of
some consumptive Mimi, or simply to buy beer
and crayfish!
A violin and mandoline follow. Has some poor
Dago musician parted with his baby and taken to
opening oysters ?
Every pledge tells a story. “ A box of carpen-
ter’s tools.” Sickness, drink, unemployment—
what ypu will.
“ A Masonic apron ! ”
Isaac displays this treasure proudly. It is a
gorgeous affair in white and blue kid, ornamented
with silver tassels. One wonders how the 'devil 'it
got there. Man pledges everything, it seems,
except his blessed soul, and that would go into
pawn too if it could raise as much as a serge suit
or a hairbrush. Souls are cheap nowadays.
Faust is still willing, but Mephistopheles, who
was a humanitarian in the Middle Ages, has gone
out of the business.
“ What am I offered ? ”
“ A bob!”
“ S’welp me,” Isaac screams, “ there’s five bob’s
vorth ov kid in id. Look at the tassels ! ”
This emblem of mystery goes for half a crown.
The crowd breathes witii difficulty and gets red
and puffy in the face. It thickens. Some people
are squeezed outside, but more are pushed in from
the street.
“ A beautiful silver vatch.”
Isaac speaks impressively from the rostrum.
“ What am I offered ? Anything you like.”
The bidding is moderate. Half a sovereign has
been offered, when an old man from the back of
the crowd shouts “Stop ! ”
“ It’s against you,” says Isaac, politely.
The old man, who is seedy and cbllarless, replies
in an English accent. “Really, I think that
watch belongs to me.”
“ Bid up !”
“ I’ve lost my ticket,” the old man continues.
“Toss him out!”
“Git werk ! ”
“ And sixpence.”
The old gentleman fights his way through the
crowd and staggers to the table. He snorts with
indignation and whisky.
“It was a pink ticket,” he explains. “I put
it in my pocket this morning.”
“ Where is it ?”
“ It isn’t your watch ! ”
“What’s the number?”
“ Shut up!”
“ What am I offered ?”
“Jewellery, I was informed, was kept six
months. Otherwise”
“ Where’s your ticket?”
“ I really can’t say. I’m a solicitor.”
“ He’s drunk.”
“Look, gentlemen, in perfect order.”
“ Bid up ! Bid up !”
“The money is mine,” cries the old man,
frantically. “I am in a robber’s den, ha! ha!
My friend ”
“ Elevfen shillings.”
“ And sixpence.”
The old man tries to climb up the table, but is
shoved back by willing hands. Falling on a fat
landlady, he exclaims, “You misunderstand,
ha ! ha ! lam not under the influence of liquor.
Believe me, it is not death lam afraid of. I was
never afraid of death. lam afraid of life. The
money is due to me. lam not a rich man
His eloquence is interrupted by Isaac raising
his gavel, and calling loudly: “Going, going,
only 16 bob; any other offer?—don’t pay any
attention to him—l 7 bob, going, going—gone.”
His hammer shakes the table.
I feel somewhat interested in the old gentle-
man who is bundled outside, talking incoherently
about his watch and ticket and fear of life.
The boy on the threshold rings his bell again,
and finds another orange in his pocket. He is
unmoved by the catastrophe.
Isaac pauses a moment. Then other articles
are produced, and again he orates from the dais.
The noisy crowd keeps squeezing in and out.
Suddenly, the old collarless gentleman who
was not afraid of death bounces, in a zigzag
manner, into the booth, and waves a pink ticket.
“My guarantee. I am not intoxicated. On
the contrary ”
Isaac, a man of resource, seizes the fateful
ticket and tears it up.
“It is overdue,” he remarks. “Don’t inter-
rupt the sale.”
The outraged old, man, in a frenzy of despair,
seizes a hanging bicycle and pulls it down. It
falls on the head of the cursing crowd. Isaac
shouts at the top of his voice. Some of the ladies
are shocked. The old man drops off to sleep on
the floor, under the bicycle wheels. A smile
hovers over his face.
GANESHA.
Races at Sandy Creek.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the first meeting of the Sandy
Creek Amateur Turf Club Picnic Races.
I’m not sure, but I think that was the title
of it. It was a bush meeting ; that was obvious.
There wasn’t a habitation of any kind within
miles, and a couple of fences undulating through
the gums and ironbarks were the only signs of
settlement.
But it was a great day. People came from all
parts—from Deep Creek and Myrtle Creak, and
even from Tatham. TheGuerens and the Ander-
sons were there, and Ben Buckle and the Thomp-
sons, and old Sol Slocum. Such a crowd was never
seenbeforeonSandyCreek. The course was a cattle-
pad, running parallel with one of the fences. The
final quarter-mile was level, and while the horses fol-
lowed the pad there were no logs to jump or trees
to pull round. The rest of the course was down
. ... ; . ..
m a deep hollow, and just beyond the winning
post was the cross fence; but the double
gate on the track was propped open, so that
fast or hard-mouthed horses could be pulled
up in the ordinary way in the next pad-
dock. The races had been got up by selectors
and farmers in the neighborhood, and the prizes
were bridles and saddles, which were dumped in
a heap at the butt of a big tree. There was also
. , . r . . . ? ~ , . , , ,
a special prize of a load of pumpkins, which had
been brought out by the farmer who gave them,
He was a prominent member of the club, and
wore some ribbon on his coat to distinguish him
from the common herd
...
A stockman and a black boy were tailing heifers
on the flat that day, and as good riders wero
scarce their services were requisitioned for the
first race. Five horses started, and as they tore
up the straight the string of hacks tied along the
, m. , , .
fence took fright. They were not used to race-
courses. Bridles were snapped in all directions ;
some of the fence was pulled down ; and a dozen
riderless horses, with tails in the air, sped before
the racers through the open gate, and sailed away
... ? 1 t u « ..1
with a tremendous clatter of hoofs across the
paddock. Excitement ran high, and the meeting
pronused to be a. g rea f
The black boy ran last. The horse 8 owner
who had been imbibing rather freely sent a
bottle whizzing after him as he went past, and
afterwards accused him of pulling, and challenged
him to fight At the stockmen s advice the boy
left to turn the heifers. The exasperated owner
had one or two more drinks, which made him still
more pugnacious, and increased his feeling of
having been wronged. lie got on his horse and
galloped after the black boy, whom he pursued
round and round the heifers, yelling like a
maniac, until the stockman met him and knocked
him off. Then he went to sleep under a log.
The black boy returned to the course, but nothing
could induce him to take part in another event
To each invitation to ride, he answered : “ Baal
me ; that one yarraman can’t win.”
Meanwhile, two more races had been run, and
some more of the station fence had been destroyed.
The majority of the hacks had been removed to
the adjoining paddock, where the ladies were con-
gregated round the pumpkin cart. Horse-owners

and scattering them about for their equities,
Empty bottles began to strew the grass around the
“ grand stand,” and three or four sportsmen were
alreadv prostrate. The bar was a plank, one end
of which rested on the bottom rail of the fence,
and the other on the spoke of a cart-wheel, the
bulk of the spirits being kept in the cart. There
was no luncheon booth. Everybody picnicked
about under trees
The fourth race saw the judge too unsteady on
his pins to mount the box-a gin-case ; but by
sitting on it he managed to strike a fairly straight
line with the ironbark tree standing opposite.
His decision evoked a rmr of laughter: “The
two black horses a dead heat.’’ There was only
on ® black horse in the race.

The owner, grasping the situation, replied :
*U-bey both belong to me, so it’s six of one an’
the other.
Ihe judge fixed him with his bleary eye.
“As to what’s one or the other, I’m judge o’
that,” he retorted. “My decision’s final, bear’n
mind.”
.j Ab r '® bt ’ old man. Don t get yer rag out,”

“ Oh, we’ll divide it.”
The prize was a saddle ; but, luckily, the judge
dld not , " sist th ? division v His atten-
tion was diver.ted by two farmers who were dis-
puting the merits of Berkshires and another breed
of hogs. One, armed with an empty bottle, \v;i-

fHitiflled after him with an ironbark sapling
Ihe dispute was settled abruptly by the capsiziii-
the bar, and the impromptu publican routed
the disputants with a bucket of water.
The women were harnessing up the dray horse
by this time, in readiness for a start for lion,
after the next race ; and it was noticeable that th>
pumpkins began to dwindle very rapidly, 'lli.
girls had commandeered little heaps, and wei

didn’t matter, however, as the remnants of tin-

CONSTIPATION CONQUERED.
There lies the vital secret where so many diseases and ailments are
concerned—Constipation must be conquered, or normal organic action,
freedom from liver and kidney troubles, and from stomach and bowel
disorders, is not possible.
Cockle’s Pills conquer Constipation of the most stubbornly aggressive
kind; because they strengthen and stimulate and revivify the organs,
which they cleanse and regulate with such consummate ease and efficiency.
The whole system is freed from the wholesale disturbance due to the con-
stipated tendency, from blood impurities, from effete matter, from lurking
disease. Yet Cockle’s Pills act so gently and pleasingly that the most
delicate persons like them.
PLAIN TRUTHS
on the subject of Health are the only acceptable pronouncements.
Exaggerated statements end by convincing no one—rather do they create
suspicion, and give rise to doubt. But you may safely listen to universal
opinion. The public have for long known the value of Beecham’s Pills
in cases of disorder and irregularity of the Stomach, Bowels, Liver and
Kidneys. Thousands of men and women know, from glad experience,
that an occasional dose of Beecham’s Pills will promote the healthy action
of these organs, and that all the good things heard on every hand
ABOUT
this . medicine are true in the strictest sense. Most people desire a
specific that can be depended upon at all times to correct the vital
functions when they are out of order and Nature calls for some assist-
ance. Such a preparation may be found in BEECHAM’S PILLS.
They will put you right and keep you up to the mark. They have
proved an immense boon to many thousands of men and women
all over the woild. It is just as certain that they will benefit you
and this is a plain truth you may accept and act upon in regard to
BEECHAM’S
PILLS.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache* Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely mbre valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
