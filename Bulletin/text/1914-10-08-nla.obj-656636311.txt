Hudson’s Eumenthol TootH Powder
SECURES SOUND WHITE TEETH AND A HEALTHY MOUTH.
Some practical reasons why Hudson's Eumenthol Tooth Powder
should be used for Cleansing and Preserving the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues
that have made Eumenthol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but
cleanses mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the teeth so wonder-
fully, and wards off decay as no other preparation for the teeth
can do, or will do, without affecting the Tooth Enamel.
BECAUSE the Committee of the British Dental Association
recommends Powder in preference to Pastes, Liquids or Soaps for
cleasing and preseiving the teeth.

Once More, Wilde
The Wilde controversy has become an
English literary Dreyfus affaire. Oscar
Wilde and Myself, by Lord Alfred Douglas
(Long, per Dymock’s Library) is the latest
bomb dropped on Wilde’s grave. It is heavily
charged with explosives. One charge of
cordite, however, has been left out. Origin-
ally the book would have included copious
extracts from the unpublished parts of De
Profundis, and some letters of Wilde’s. It is
well known that the published De Profundis
represented only extracts from a much
larger manuscript; but many statements
made by Douglas in regard to this com-
position are now published for the first time.
The complete manuscript was presented to
the British Museum by Robert Ross, the
literary executor of Wilde, on the under-
standing that it was not to be published till
1960, when all the actors in the drama will
be somewhat dead. However, in an action
taken by Douglas against Arthur Ransome
and The Times Book Club, extracts from
the unpublished portion were read in court.
Naturally Douglas now desires to reply to
these allegations by Wilde, but is precluded
by a legal injunction from quoting any part
of the unpublished manuscript.
J*
Douglas undoubtedly bitterly that
he ever met Wilde. He complains that
since Wilde’s downfall he has been con-
tinually compelled to take legal proceedings
against his slanderers. “Generally, the
parties concerned have been men of straw,
who apologised abjectly or disappeared or
got out by asserting that they did not mean
what they had tried to say, immediately
the writs were issued.” Hence Douglas’s
determination now to set out the whole
details of his relationship with Wilde. It
is, especially in relation to De Profundis,
an astounding, and apparently, a true story.
Douglas was but 23 when he met Wilde
at Oxford. Douglas was then “a fairly un-
sophisticated hoy. Even at the age of 23 I
had the appearance of a youth of 16.” A
photograph bears this out.
I was never allowed to forget that I was
Lord Alfred Douglas, the son of a marquis
and a person of consequence... . Wllde
made a dead set at me. He was attracted
by my youth, my guilelessness, and —to be
perfectly frank —by what he considered my
social importance, and he laid himself out
to captivate me and to fascinate me. He
was then about 40 years of age He
flattered me incessantly, he professed ex-
treme admiration for the few poetical efforts
which I had then produced 1 conceived a
great and lasting affection for this man;
and, when he was in trouble, I fought for
him and defended him.
It is, a wicked picture of Wilde’s alleged
snobbishness and personal vanity that now
Douglas, in the bitterness of his heart,
virulently paints.
Nothing would make him angrier than
the hint that his mouth was too large or
that his face was spoiled by too great an
expanse of jowl. He took great care of his
complexion, and I never knew a man who
brushed his hair more frequently in the
day than he did.. . .Wilde was, to a large
extent, a tailor’s man. I sometimes think
that if he had lived in the present era of
Homburg hats and tweed suits he would
never have been famous at all. .. .In his in-
tercourse with the “highest in the land”
-—which was, to put it plainly, of a very
occasional nature—he always seemed to me
•to, be a trifle strained and uneasy. He
longed to smack certain personages on the
back, but he never dared to do it. With
women he succeeded a great deal better
than with men. Somehow, the men made
him either very stiff or very limp When
he came away Wilde was always as eager
to know how he had “gone down,” as a
debutante is eager to be informed as to
the figure she cut at her first ba11... .His
social evenings were a source of joy and
delight to him, and he would talk of this
or that party for months after it had taken
place, with continual notes of gratification
in his voice.
It was /Wilde’s insistence on being a
gentleman that justifies a person of such
perfect taste as Douglas in remarking that
while Sir William Wilde may have died,
according to Ransome, “a celebrated oculist
and aurist,” he began life as an apothecary,
and for years kept a chemist’s shop in an
obscure part of Dublin. Douglas asserts
that, during all the time he knew him, Wilde
was not on terms of anything like intimacy
with any of the distinguished people of his
day. “Yet to hear him talk of all these
people one would have supposed that he
was a regular member of their circle
Wilde w r as never able to get one of them
to come to his house, and never by any
chance went to see them at theirs.”
In 1895 Douglas’s friendship for Wilde
had ripened into intimacy. Instead of Wilde
spending thousands on Douglas, Douglas
asserts he spent more on Wilde. Wilde had
little money : Douglas had plenty—or could
borrow plenty. “It never occurred to me to
refuse him anything.”
Just before A Woman of No Importance
was put on I wept to a money-lender and
borrowed £250. At lunch I showed Wilde
the money in ten-pound notes, and he took
them in his hand and said : “How beautiful
they are and how wonderful it is of you to
be able to get them.” Then, with a laugh,
he put five or six of them into his own
pocket and handed me the balance. I
thought no more about it* at the moment
than I should have thought of sharing a
bottle of wine with him. ( Indeed, I got the
money with the intention of giving him
some of it because he had been groaning for
over a week about his hard-up-ness.
In refutation of the veiled charge made
against Douglas that he had been the cause
of the ruin of Wilde’s life, Douglas quotes
dates. He is able to show that on the dates
given by Ransome even Wilde’s name was
unknown to him —a boy of IS. “So that
by the time we did meet he had already
found his way to the lowest moral depths
without my juvenile assistance.!’ tin Wilde’s
release he had, from a sympathiser. £BOO at
his command. At Berneyal he squandered
this money. Douglas states that then Wilde
wrote to him. explaining that he had spent
his last shilling. Douglas telegraphed his
train fare to Naples and invited him to
make Douglas’s villa his joint home. There
the whole of the expenses were paid by
Douglas.
J*
It was there that he completed The Ballad
of Reading Gaol.
He labored over it in a manner which I
had never known him to labor before. Every
word had to be considered; every rime
and every cadence carefully pondered. I
had Ballad of Reading Gaol for breakfast,
dinner and tea, and for many weeks it was
almost our sole topic of conversation. .. .
Wilde consistently made free use of such
gifts (of criticism) as I possessed; I
assisted him to many a piece of dialogue
and many a gibe which has helped to make
him famous There are passages in this
poem which he lifted holus-bolus from a
poem of my own (Douglas does not supply
these passages), and it must be remembered
that, while up to the time that he left Read-
ing Gaol he had affected some scorn of the
ballad form and knew next to nothing of
its possibilities. I had given a great amount
of attention to the study of that form, arid
had produced the Ballad of Perldn Warbeclc
and the Ballad of St. Vitus —which latter
Wilde read for the first time at Naples, and
with which he was mightily impressed.
It is evident both from passages like this
and from his criticism of Wilde’s work, that
Douglas has faint idea of his own
Literary importance.
Soon Douglas found that his. friends in
England, objecting to his association with
Wilde, threatened to stop supplies unless
he separated from him. Douglas then left
Wilde at his villa, the rent of which had
been paid in advance, and arranged to let
him have certain moneys. In Paris Doug-
las’s cheque-books show that in a single
year he gave Wilde £4O0 —and he reckons
in addition an additional £6OO in notes and
cash. All this in refutation of the charge
that Douglas lived on Wilde.
Of the last phase
He was the biggest eater I ever knew, and
the only man I ever met in my life who
could drink quantities of champagne at
each meal and keep on doing it. He had a
fine head for drink, and it Was not until
18 months or so before his death that he
began to lose it. He would rise from his
seat and say: “My dear fellow, I am sorry,
but I perceive that I am drunk.” Then he
would call loudly for p cab and stumble
forth. He made a great joke about these
drunken fits, and one day said to me: “I
have made a wonderful discovery: I find
that alcohol taken persistently and in suffi-
ciently large quantities produces all the
effects of intoxication.”
After his death Douglas paid for the
funeral and settled Wilde’s debts.
It is strange to learn that The Ballad of
Reading Gaol was offered to a New York
paper and declined ! Also that for several
months it could not find a publisher.
Precluded from printing quotations from
the unpublished portion of De Profundis,
Douglas rather cleverly contrives to indi-
cate the tenor of that remarkable document.
It contains about SO,OOO words, and is
addressed to Douglas. Of this latter fact
there is no indication in the published por-
tion. Douglas asserts that until the action
against Ransome was pending he had no
knowledge of the existence of the unpub-
lished manuscript. Douglas suggests that
Wilde wrote this attack upon him under a
misapprehension. Wilde, in prison, be-
lieved that Douglas, his friend, had de-
serted him. “Either he did not know, or
pretended not to know, of the precise inti-
mations given to me not to visit or write
to him.” Douglas had steady reports of
him from Ross, but no word or hint that
Wilde was angry with him until lie had
nearly completed his sentence. At their
first meeting after his release Wilde told
Douglas that he had “a hideous confession
to make.” He said that in his bitterness
against Douglas while in prison lie had
written Douglas a very fierce and abomin-
able letter. Douglas did receive a copy of
such a letter from Ross, which he destroyed,
and told Ross that if Wilde had anything
to say to him lie could say it in his own
handwriting. So when Wilde spoke of his
“hideous confession” Douglas thought he was
referring to the letter Ross had sent, and
told Wilde that he had read only a-few lines
of it, and then had destroyed it. Douglas
asserts that though, from that day forth,
Wilde was continually in his com-
pany and also in receipt of money from
him, Wilde never breathed a single word
of the secret manuscript. When Douglas
heard from the press announcements that
Wilde had left a manuscript with Ross for
publication, he was exceedingly astonished.
Douglas never knew till 1912 IT years
later —that it was addressed to himself.
Douglas suggests that either Wilde gave it
to Ross to publish, and right up to his death
professed to be Douglas’s friend, or, on leav-
ing prison, finding that he had been misin-
formed about Douglas’s attitude, lie in-
tended to destroy the manuscript, but failed
to cancel his instructions.
J*
Ransome tells us that the book is com-
posed of passages from a long letter, the
complete publication of which would be im-
possible in this generation. “The passages.”
he adds, “were selected and put together by
Ross, with a skill that it is impossible suffi-
ciently to admire.” Whereat Douglas -
Quite so. But it can be demonstrated
out of the text that Ross’s selecting* and
puttings-togei her have, in the net result,
entirely deceived the public, not only With
regard to the nature and intentions of De
Prof midis as a book, but also with regard to
Wilde’s own character and his attitude
towards his own misfortune.... In Ross’s
version of De Profundis he offers no samples
of Wilde, the vituperative spitter-out of
venom, or of Wilde, the braggart and vain
boaster, such as appear in the reports of the
Ransome trial.... Wilde emerges from the
mire a gracious', suffering, forgiving, mag-
nanimous figure. Tin; extracts from Wilde’s
own manuscript, read and relied on
by the counsel for the defendant in
the Ransome trial, prove -him _to be.....
the direct opposite.... In all his cunning,
overweening and merciless desire to damage
and destroy me, Wilde could never find
it’ in his heart to set down the last un-
thinkable lie. .. .Nowhere in all his outpour-
ing of hate does he dare Come out with the
accusation which would put me outside the
pale of social possibility.... When the manu-
script is published—and it will be out of
copyright one day—Oscar Wilde is finished.
No reputation, however securely founded, can
hope to survive the moral debdcle which this
manuscript demonstrates to have taken place
in the mind of Oscar Wilde.
Finally Douglas issues this challenge to
Ross :
Neither Mr. Ross nor any other person
dare print or publish the thing as it stands,
because of its libellous character... .Mr.
Ross therefore stores this libel at the British
Museum till 1960.. I will publish the
whole manuscript, word for word, and line
for line, without omitting or curtailing any-
thing, and over it I will publish my reply,
and the public at large shall be left to judge
between Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred
Douglas.
So the case reaches another stage. The
libel actions still N go 0n.... and Frank
Harris is now announced to give in print
his version of L'Affaire Wilde.
Max Reinhardt
As Wells justly said, we are dot fighting
the German people, but Prussian military
despotism. In the realm of art we may
accord to the German our frank appreciation
of his merits': Max Reinhardt is the most
celebrated theatrical producer in the world:
and his reforms of the stage, his methods of
production, and his remarkable and inspirit-
ing ideals command oiir deepest attention.
The Theatre of Mar Reinhardt (Palmer) , by
Iluntly Garter, is not so revolutionary nor so
interesting a work as that critic’s The Xeie
Spirit in Drama and Art. An explanation
of the form of the former volume is given in
a letter to Gordon Craig, from the author,
printed in Tite Mask, the quarterly journal
devoted to Craig’s stage theories. The author
alleges that he had difficulty in compelling
the publisher to produce the book, finally hav-
ing to take legal proceedings by which the
publisher was bound over to produce. He is
alleged to have done so in his own way, with-
out allowing the author to revise the work,
or to bring it up to date, and omitting most
of the illustrations.
One of the greatest changes worked by
Reinhardt is in his use of colored lights.
“Color is fast deserting scenery and costumes
for the limelights, owing no doubt to the dis-
covery that the conventional system of stage
lighting is obsolete and stupid. The impossi-
bility is now fully apparent to artists, who
find'that they can do nothing with batteries
of lights placed at the most unsuitable
angles, and producing dirty tones that ruin
their finest effects. Decorators are in fact
convinced that they can attain a far better
result by the use of neutral surfaces and
some colored limes served by intelligent
operators. To them it is more intelligent to
prepare their palette with colored limes and
to paint each detail of scenery, costumes and
accessories with a single ray, or a mixt ,4 l
rays of light and their reflections, Golois
have not, nowever, entirely deserted the xe-
form stage, and occasionally satisractoi
results are obtained by mixing the colorea
rays with the colors worn by the players ana
the scenery.” .
Another reform that would be appreciated
in the Commonwealth is Reinhardt s practi-
cal abolition of the interval, owing to his use
of the revolving stage and the sinking stage
(as in The Miracle). In his reforms Rein-
hardt does not depend solely upon himself.
He is no arbitrary ‘-producer, but merely
the ehief-of-staff of a number of enthusiastic-
specialists. And he has had much to do.
“The demonstrable fact is that the theatie
always has been, and is still, a vastly in-
terior, imperfect and disjointed instrument ot
dramatic expression, in England especial y
is this true. There the surroundings ot the
theatre are grotesque and degrading : its con-
struction is bad, its form obsolete ; its design
and decoration serve neither to preserve the
gravity, dignity nor simplicity of beauty, its
auditorium is rudimentary; its three-sided
stage belongs properly to the Stone Age , and
its lighting, scenery, properties and other
mechanical aids never escape the suspicion
of being what they are—theatre stuff.”
Max Reinhardt is just 41 years old. lie
lias had a remarkable career. It was as an
actor of striking personality that he made
himself famous, and his venture into produc-
ing. from the most modest beginnings, has
seen him rapidly rise to the directorship ot
the Deutsches Theater, in Berlin. Doubtless
some of our Australian contingent will be
enabled to view a “command”; performance
there this year. It seems a pity that none
of our theatrical managers volunteered for
the front.
Jt
Germanv is the home of the endowed
theatre. There are Court Theatres, National
Theatres and Municipal Theatres in most of
the big cities. Consider IMisseldorf, a town
half the size of Sydney. It possesses a
large variety theatre and a vahdeville
theatre; two theatres devoted to serious
work ; the usual municipal theatre; the State
theatre, with its two stock companies, one
for drama and one for opera; and a Reform-
biiline —that is, a provincial parallel of
Reinhardt’s reform theatre. And in Sydney
we have not a single endowed theatre, nor
the remotest prospect of one.
“The endowed theatre system has offered
many advantages. It has been a distinct
cultural influence; it has established a
national gallery of drama; it has afforded
new-comers a hearing; it lias established a
desirable system of theatre .organisation; it
has given birth to the Repertory movement,
and it has lent itself to the artistic move-
ment, The subsidising is done in various
ways, by the reigning duke., by the. State, by
the corporation, which appoints a director, or
leases its theatre to a manager, who receives
certain concessions for the purpose of enab-
ling him to keep his eye on art and off the
box-office, and by private individuals who
band together as shareholders to provide a
suitable theatre for good plays in their
centre.... Until within 30 years ago the
State and Municipal Theatres paid fairly
well, some of them exceptionally well. To-
day, however, practically none of them pay.
Now there are cities and towns in Germany
losing from £7-100 to £lO.OOO a year owing
to the hivh standard which they try to
uphold in their own theatres.” The Court
Theatres and the privately-subsidised
theatres are in the same condition. The
reason for this failure —and the reason for
the remarkable success of Reinhardt —is
that the German public is getting sick of
culture and demands art. The Moscow Art
Theatre earns about £lO,OOO clear profit
per annum.
Reinhardt’s famous Deutsches Theatre has
a revolving stage and a unique scheme of
lighting. This is due to Fortuny’s inven-
tion, which did away with sky-borders, and
substituted a pure white light for the tinted
light in use. “Color is obtained by the
light being thrown first upon reflectors, and
thereafter upon the scene in such a way
that the tinted light is diffused instead of
being focussed upon certain points, say the
backcloth, or the bald head of the leading
man. Forming part of this system of light-
ing is a hooded background of white con-
crete upon which Fortuny throws his
light in order to obtain vast and very im-
pressive sky effects.” In producing Much
Ado About Nothing, Reinhardt’s revolving
stage enabled him to set. the 14 scenes on it
at the same time.. However, Reinhardt’s
chief contribution to the theatre is greater
than the intelligent use of these merely
mechanical devices. He has demonstrated
fhat a theatre may be run successfully on
a commercial and artistic basis. That is
a lesson that our Australian managers have
yet to learn.
In these days of carnage Carnation Grow-
ing Made Easy, by ,T. G. Hockley (Is. 6d.),
has small chance of an enthusiastic welcome.
Yet the manual is brightly and interestingly
written for the suburban gardener.

The Barrow for Mines, Factories, etc.
These Barrows, although light, are strongly built, and for the rough usage
usually accorded a barrow are unequalled. The tubular steel forming the

Your Tongue never fails
to tell you when your system is out of order. Look
now and see if it is thick, creamy-coated. This is the
sign the Doctor always looks for when he suspects
biliousness or a disordered stomach, and were you to
ask his advice he would most probably tell you that
the best remedy is Cockle’s Antibilious Pills, which
are made according to the prescription of a famous
English Doctor.

A REPUTATION OF OVER 100 YEARS.
Never advocated as a panacea for all ills, but for those
occasions when you don’t feel quite “ up to the mark”;
when you feel drowsy, heavy-headed, liverish, out-of-
sorts ; when your tongue is white, breath unpleasant
and complexion sallow—that is the time when Cockle’s
Pills prove invaluable. Two Cockle’s Pills to-night
will work wonders by
to-morrow —try them !
AFSAF
In the Old Coaching Days
in England long before railways existed Cockle’s
Pills constituted the sole family corrective in thou-
sands of homes. Merit alone has enabled them
to stand the test of time longer than any other.

What is more pitiable than a pretty woman whose neck, arms and
scraggy chest destroy her every chance ot being really charming?
Nothing gives charm to' a woman so 'nuch as does a full, well-rounded,
perfectly-developed figure. If you laok it, science will enable you to
obtain it.
WHEN you look into the mirror and your
hollow cheeks, thin neck and scrawny
arms mock even you, what effect do
you suppose they have on those with whom
you mix socially?... .A woman’s chief charm
is a well-rounded figure ''and full bosom. With
these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a
rarity.
If your bust lacks development, and you
are scraggly and attenuated, we will advise
you free and gladly as to how you may im-
prove your figure and beautify your bust.
We are only too pleased to tell you the
secret, for we know it cannot fail, and that
in a few weeks you will be happier, healthier
and more sought after socially than in your
present undeveloped, emaciated condition.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages
of ill-health have sought and accepted this ad-
vice, and to-day are models of womanly de-
velopment and examples of perfect health.
The same success awaits your call. In the
wake of attenuation follow such complaints
as constipation, indigestion, bilious head-
aches, internal functional derangements, etc.
As your development advances and weight im-
proves, these gradually disappear and perfect
health results.
Every case is accepted under a guarantee
to refund fee if satisfactory results do not
follow the use of the treatment. SEND FOR

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.
You Can Try It FREE.
Send 2d. Stamp, and we will post you a

Crillon.
When Henry of Navarre was king,
Never braver times than those ;
When each blood-red sun that rose
Struck dread terror in her foes,
France rode on, still conquering.
Henry to his comrade wrote;
Grimly smiling o’er his pen ;
O’er the ink-stained sheet again :
Wrote to‘his doughtiest of men
Words the warrior well might note.
“Yesterday at Arques we fought,
God the victory to me brought,
Crillon, hang thyself !—unsought
Other blood that victory bought.
A victory where thou hast no share:
We fought at Arques, and Thou not there !”
Crillon envied all the slain,
Blood of France poured out like rain,
Smote his breast, again, again.
Then in accents of despair—
Cried, “Crillon!. . . .and Thou not there”. ..
So may one day, or far or near,
Some brave Australian write his friend,
“We fought at. . . . Thou wert not there!
Braver heart than thine, there’s none.
Not beneath Australia’s sun,
Stay, help man the garrison,
Yet. nor hang thee, nor despair,
I missed thee sore.... Thou wert not there —
“But now in good Alsatian beer
To thee I drink. . . .1 think of Thee,
And all brave comrades past the sea.
Heaven knows alone how heartily
I would love to have thee here.”

The Song of the Gun.
Grim, on my vantage ground I swing,
And find the range, and roar, and sing.
“Bang! Boom !”
Make room, make room
For the screaming shell as a course it takes
From the stunning bang the cordite makes !
Men, in the crowding ranks below.
I’ll lay you down, red row on row !
I am the Gun !
Oft do my gunners, who serve me well.
Tales of my terrible doings tell.
Yet have I known them sob and fall
And lie too quiet to hear me bawl,
“Boom ! Bang!”
While the breech-blocks clang
I’ll sweep the slopes of my hillside clear
For the honor of gunner and bombardier —
Aye, and the Gun.
Once, when the hosts from the plains closed
in,
My gunners lowered my lips that grin,
And I wrapped out oaths that were black
and wrong;
And the big shells cried as they roared along,
“Oh! Oh!
Look out below!”
And, red in the ranks that came on first,
Were gaping wounds where they blazed and
burst,
Hot from the Gun.
A gunner said, and he patted me:
“You stung them then, old Bumble-Bee,
Old Son-of-a-Gun.”
Oh ! he was brave and he did not mind
The rifle bullets that sang and whined.
Bang! Boom !
As he met his doom
He heard me bellowing vengeance grim
For robbing his gun of the touch of him —
I was his Gun !
I, who have held my peace so long,
Lo, I am loosed from the binding thong;
“Bang! Boom!”
And youth’s fresh bloom
Is laid in swathes on the earth so old,
For Earth, the Mother, to have and hold.
Oh ! women who’ve sent their men to war
May sadly hark to my voice afar,
The voice of the Gun.
lam the Gun ! With ugly leer
I roar, as the smoke-wreaths lift and clear,
“Boom ! Bang !”
And the trail-bolts clang
At the fierce recoil from the cordite’s cough,
While the screaming shells go soaring oil'
To burst and kill and maim strong men....
Soon I’ll be shackled and bound again.
(“Bang! Boom!”
In the dawn’s grey gloom!)
Soon —but to-day I am loosed and free,
And Earth and Heaven must hark to me—
I am the Gun!

A Ballad of Glad Days.
Do you remember how of old
We lay and watched the moon sink low
A-down a sky that warmed to gold?
(It was so very long ago!)
We saw the morning radiance grow
While all the shadows slid away
In vague procession soft and 510 w....
Dear love, it seems but yesterday!
Hope in our hearts sprang brave and bold..
I fear you have forgotten, though.
Not yours the fault, if truth be told. . . .
It was so very long ago!
Your little hands! The gleaming snow
Of dimpled shoulders! Ah, the gay
Hed lips that kissed and lured me 50!....
Dear love, it seems but yesterday !
You’d frown at times, and feign to scold ;
Anon you’d croon »nd panting glow,
Or sob in passion uncontrolled....
It was so very long ago!
Love rushed in overwhelming flow.
Youth paused and laughed but would not
stay.
(Fate mocked; but how were we to know?)
Dear love, it seems but yesterday!
L’Envoy.
Babette, you were content; but, oh,
It was so very long ago!
Close in my arms at dawn you lay.
Dear love, it seems but yesterday!

ignition system that will stand a similar test.

A DUST CLOUD AND A BONE AND A
FEDERAL CITY.
On a recent day the Sydney Telegraph
played a low-down jest on its readers. .It
published a picture of the cool, swift,
abundant Snowy River —the one river of
any importance in New South \\ ales which
never lass or decays, because it is fed by
the snows and the ice-cap of the tallest
mountain group which the continent
possesses. The picture (a copy of it ap-
pears herewith, and all due acknowledg-
ment is made) showed a fisherman seeking
for fish in this cheerful torrent. The
attached letterpress said that one drawback
of the Snowy, from a fisherman’s point of
view, was the frequent floods. Imt nothing
was said about the fact that the capital
first selected for Australia was on the banks
of this ever-vigorous bit of water, which
could supply enough gratis power m its
downward course to lun the industnes ot
a city as large as Sydney and Melbourne
combined. Nothing was said about the tacts
that the present Australian capital site has
no water power; that it has no swiftly-
flowing, crystal stream tumbling down from
the heights; that the adjacent creeks are
sluggish, green-mouldy affairs, crawling about
the feet of the unbuilt city; and that Can-
berra, these days, is mostly a bone and a
cloud of dust, and a disappointment, and a
forgotten circumstance. The drought lias
come again. The awful Australian capi-
tal, which the Sydney Telegraph was
largely instrumental in establishing, is fed
by a few trickles which potter down from
the driest section of eastern New South
Wales, and the dry weather has struck it.
So it is no more mentioned than if it was
a recently-hanged murderer or one of Hol-
man’s latest deficits. Even the new Tele-
GRAPH editor dare not publish a nice, tresh
picture, showing a sportsman in knicker-
bockers, catching fish in the Cotter or the
Molonglo or the Queanbeyan.
When tlie question of the Australian
capital site came up for settlement the
matter was left almost entirely to the poli-
ticians of New South Wales. By the
oiimv treachery of George Reid and his
gang all the other States had been disquali-
fied as possible possessors of the capital
site, and the other States, being about as
csoificih anybody else, lost interest in the
“5 when New Sonth Wales
came to decide the problem it was discov-
ered that New South Wales was practically
Sydney. The first site selected was, as
already mentioned, on the Snowy —the
one unfailing stream of which the
State can boast. But by reason of the
magnificent water supply and the. abund-
ance of cheap power for manufacturing pur-
poses, it was quite obvious that a city
might grow up there which would eclipse
Sydney. Then, though the place was much
nearer to Sydney than to Melbourne or to any
other Australian capital, it was so far from
Sydney that it was liable to develop a big
port of its own at the adjacent Twofold
Bay. The theory of the Sydney congestion
crowd —the same crowd which now talks so
much about the need for decentralisation—
was that it would be better that the Aus-
tralian capital should be an impecunious
hamlet and a dead loss, located in Sydney’s
back yard, than that it should be great
public asset outside the range of Sydney
influence. And of this crowd the.TELE-
grapii was the prophet, and the principal
liar and the chief parish hog. Can-
berra was chosen, because of its disadvan-
tages. The Telegraph itself said proudly
that the place for which it had clamored
would never be more than a country town.
It seemed to think that, in securing a place
that would never be more than a country
town as the capital of a continent —the only
continental capital in all history—it had
done something to be proud of.
These days Canberra hardly gets a men-
tion in the papers. It is apparently dead.
There is nothing on the premises, now that
the drought has started, save a dry bone
and a whirlwind. Melbourne is the Federal
capital, and seems likely to occupy the billet
for an indefinite period. The Australian
Government is hard-pressed for money, and,
recognising that Canberra will be always a
loss, it has naturally slowed down on the
construction of the Federal homestead. If the
blessed metropolis was in the old site beside
the Snowy River, where a heap of money
could be made by leasing out water-power
rights to manufacturers, the current impe-
THE SNOWY RIVER.
The ever-flowing N.S. W. stream beside which it was first proposed to place the Aus-
tralian capital. Sydney Telegraph, which was largely responsible for getting the capital
site shifted to Dryberra, has just reminded the community, in this droughty season, of its
folly in following the TELEGRAPH’S advice, by publishing this photo. [ Photo. carefully
copied from a recent issue of Sydney TELEGRAPH,]
cuniosity might urge the Government to
special activity, but no one wants to hurry
over a pauper institution when coin is
scarce. A citv with great prospects may
easily be worth £100,000,000 to the com-
munity which owns it, but one with less
than no prospects is a different matter.
Even the Sydney Telegraph doesn’t allude
to Canberra any more than once in three
months, and probably the new editor couldn t
find it on the map. Nobody remembers
exactly what benefit Sydney was to get by
the establishment of a dry, back-yard capital.
Yet the paper which is now bossed by the
imported D. D. Braham should not rub in
the ignominy and the treachery by publish-
ing a picture of the Snowy River at a time
when the drought has got hold of most of
Australia. To impress on Australia what
kind of a capital site it lost through lending
a foolish ear to Braham’ s paper is over-
doing things.
THE FISCAL SUPERSTITION.
A few days ago It. L. Nash (he signed his
, na me in conformity with the Act), of Sydney
Telegraph, tried once more to lift the
Foreign-trade craze out of the mild of disre-
pute and the bog of disgrace. Lest anyone
should think that an attempt is made to take
undue advantage of the Telegraph’s fiscal
superstition, by supplying mere extracts from
the Nash yarn, the tale is hereunder printed
in full. For italics, capital letters and
printed emphasis in general, The Bulletin
is responsible: —
A SELF-CONTAINED AUSTRALIA.
In these days of growing tariffs any excuse may
be regarded as good enough for giving an additional
turn to the fiscal screw. But the fasmonable excuse
appears just now to be that the more self-contained
Australia can become, especially in war-time, the
better it will be for her in the future. There iias
EVEN BEEN LAMENTATION THAT THE BRITISH FLEET
lIAS SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THE OCEAN ROUTES FAIRLY
CLEAR because had they been closed we should have
had to be self-contained, whether we liked it or not.
Such look like the arguments of the advocates of a pio-
hibitive tariff. Yet the richest and most prosperous
countries of the world are not and
have no intention of becoming so. As for Australia,
in spite of her high tariff, she has an enormous ex-
ternal trade, and it is a clear indication of tier
prosperity. These Protectionists, however, would say
that they had no objection to exports, so long as
Australia did not import. Well, it is impossible to
export without importing, and trade must always
be balanced. The reason why Australia has
prospered so greatly has been because in so many
cases here 20,000 workers are in a position to turn
out as much value as 100,000 elsewhere, and the
products of the one can be freely exchanged for the
products of the greater number elsewhere. Ot
course, our vast area helps us. But if we were self-
contained that exchange would he impossible. We
should have a surfeit of much,and a famine in much
more, and that is not wealth. AVe have no desire
whatever to see Australia self-contained, hut every
desire to see her trade routes kept open and the
country profiting by them. x
If there is any Protectionist in. Australia
who laments because the fleets ol tire I.nu&n
Empire have managed to keep the sea-routes
fairly safe, the name and address of the
scoundrel are unknown at iHR
oflice. If they are known to It. L. Aash
of the Sydney Telegraph, he certainly ought,
as a loyal British subject, to supply the in-
formation to the police, so that the nusueant
may be watched. If the ruffian sleeps on the
verandah a constable should sit on the tence.
If the unpublishable hound sleeps indoors, an
officer of the law should stand guard m the
hall, beside the hat-rack and umbrella-stand.
And the office or shop of the betrayer should
be shadowed. No Protectionist with whom
this publication consorts is such an ass as
to believe that the temporary loss ot sea-
control by the British Empire would promote
Australian manufactures. lhe war must
end some day, and the sea-control question
must be settled sooner or later. A manutac-
turer doesn’t spend many thousands ot
pounds on new buildings and machinery
for the production of some particular
article simply because a marine war
has for the moment, obstructed toe
importation of low-priced goods in his
particular line. He isn’t the maniac that
K. L. Nash takes him for. lhe I reetrade
importer may grab the skirts of chance wit, 1
a few extra consignments of shoddy, when
war or some other unusual circumstance up
sets the customary, order of things, and he
may sell the goods on the spur of the moment
with the aid of a few anaemic clerks and shop-
men. He is partly a gambler and partly a
wild cat. But the manufacturer has a
stake in the country? to use a good old 1 oiy
phrase. He wants law and ordei anci
settled conditions. While wages in Aus-
tralia are vastly higher than wages in many
countries that compete with Australia, he
is naturally anxious for a tariti to make
good the difference. Otherwise he keeps out
of business, and the country has to depend
on foreign imports and foreign speculators
and foreign loans.
The Freetrade theory—one much adver-
tised by that insane genius, Henry George
—is that tariffs are unnecessary because
imports must always be paid for by exports.
As the Sydney Telegraph man puts it in
his latest appeal on behalf of the importer:
“Trade must always be balanced.” Unfor-
tunately trade hasn’t always balanced. Be-
cause of that miserable fact Australia
now owes about £220,000,000 abroad on
public debt account alone. It is struggling
almost every day to borrow more money
abroad, because trade doesn’t balance. Also
there is an immense amount owing abroad on
private accounts because trade doesn’t bal-
ance. The foreign debts were acquired by the
simple process of importing more goods than
the country could pay for. The value of
these debts didn’t come out in the shape of
gold, for England, our chief creditor, isn’t a
gold-producing country. It reached here in
the form of steel rails, ships, clothes, loco-
motives, bell-toppers, boots, and in a thou-
sand other forms of trade, and a pretence was
made at restoring the balance by exporting
our lOU. Still the Telegraph luminary’s con-
tention is true in one sense! Even without a
tariff, and without any attempt to pay our
way and supply our own requirements, trade
balances itself before the Day of Judgment.
The country that has imported too much
exports its filed schedule, and its composition
of 2d. in the £. Many countries have done
that sort of thing, and doubtless many more
will do it. Even Australia had a small
experience in the same line of business.
Prior to 1893 it did an immense amount of
importing—far in excess of its exports.
Then the City Bank of Melbourne exported
the information that it was broke, and the
Federal Bank exported the news that it
couldn’t pay, and dozens of land banks ex-
ported the fact that their British creditors
could whistle for their money. Other con-
cerns exported the tidings that the bottom
had fallen out. Thus a certain Freetrade
balance was restored, and a lot of outstand-
ing imports were paid for. It wasn’t an
agreeable process. The poverty and misery
and breakage and slump and suicide were
appalling. The Freetrade or Revenue-tariff
doctrine that trade always finds its own
level was vindicated. But there was such a
heartbreaking amount of beggary, and there
were so many funerals required to vindicate
the doctrine, that people began to regard the
thing as too expensive—not in money but in
flesh and blood. Some excited folk actually
imagined that the doctrine which It. U. Nash
of the Telegraph propounded last week was
really the Beast of Revelation —the animal
whose telephone number was 660.
* * * *
According to the views of Cobden, Aus-
tralia’s “enormous external trade” “is a clear
indication of her prosperity.” There is room
for doubt. The Jubilee Juggins had an
enormous external trade. S_o liad Ernes
Tekah llooley. So had Joseph Eakle
Hermann, of Sydney, now committed to
trial, whose turnover was said to equal
£150.000 a year. The external tiade
of Bell and Davies, a Sydney im-
porting firm which fled with all its
creditors’ money a generation ago, was very
large. Probably no concern had a nobler
external trade in its day than the South Sea
Bubble, and the external trade of Charles
Surface with the money-lenders was consid-
erable. The short and simple summary ot the
case is this : If a country or individual makes
a profit out of external trade, it is good. But
if external trade means buying things that
can’t be paid for, and giving an lOU, charged
to posterity, for several hundred million
pounds to cover the difference, it is wholly
bad. „
It is The Bulletin’s great ambition to
be a Freetrader—not exactly like R. L.
Nash, of the Sydney Telegraph, but
rather like what R. L. Nash, of the
Sydney Telegraph, would be if he
lived up to his own theories. It would
be essential, in the first place, to abolish the
absentee, even if he had to be taxed up to <•>
per cent. (15s. in the £) in order to abolish
him. Next, the existing foreign debt should
be paid off. Thirdly, a law should be passed
to provide for the prompt hanging of anybod, 1 -
who tried to establish a new foreign debt m
a new absentee. Having thus got the public
ship on an even keel, it would be possible to
live up to the theory propounded by R. L.
Nash, of the Sydney Telegraph, that “trade
must always be balanced.” No matter what
happened to Australia in the way of working
hours, wages, workers’ accommodation,
poverty, misery, hunger or sundries, trade
would balance. It would balance itself. Nobody
would stack the cards any longer with tariffs,
or load the dice with foreign loans —public
or private. All duties would be extinguished.
' The whole national income would be raised
by income-tax on R. L. Nash and his friends,
and by land-tax on similar people. Competi-
tion would be free, and if R- L. Nash didn’t
like to toil for the wages of a Chinese com-
petitor the Chinese competitor could have his
job. This idea is great. The oftener you
look at it the greater it becomes.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
New South Wales and the Government
Thereof.
The wonderful Holman Government of New
South Wales got to the end of the first
quarter of the financial year without abso-
lutely going up the spout. That is to say,
the bailiff didn’t seize its soft garments and
its hard boots. But unless it acquires
some sense or brains or political honesty, a
lot of things are liable to happen to it and
to the State. In the hrst three months of
1913, despite the fact that the Ministry of
Profligates had the biggest revenue in the
State’s record to play with, this was the
result: —-
First Quarter op 1913.
Revenue. Expenditure. Deficit.
£3,916,810 £4,710,542 £793,732
The shortage grew bigger and bigger as the
year went on, and all manner of trust
funds were borrowed, or cadged or stolen;
and overdrafts were incurred, and loans
floated, and mad proceedings devised to get
a penny or two to go on with. A combina-
tion which is capable of giving a disaffected
supporter £4 a day for "expenses” in addi-
tion to the Parliamentary salary which he
isn’t earning—in order that he may pro-
ceed to the United States and report on dry
irrigation, or something of the sort, requires
a heap of money to get along with. This
is quite apart from the report that a poll;
tician’s wife received £4 a day “expenses
for a trip to Europe. Naturally the defacil
became appalling, and taxes were shovec
up. There was even talk of retrenchment
and economy, and some voice in the hind
row of things, crying out like a lame baby
devil at the back of perdition, mentioned
political honesty as a possible expedient.
This is the consequence of all these reforms
up to date :
First Quarter op 1914.
Revenue. ' Expenditure. Deficit.
£4,125,850 £5,002,675 £876,825
So, during the first three months of 1912
the merry and cheerful Plolman Govern-
ment, with the biggest revenue in the State s
record, was going to perdition at the rate o
£3,174,92S per annum. During the first
three months of 1914, with a still biggei
revenue, it was-going to Hades at the rate oi
£3,507,300 per annum. Apparently all the
money on earth isn’t sufficient to keep the
Holman financial ship on an even keel
For a while Holman can buy votes and
personal popularity by handing out roads
and bridges and railways to his supporters.
But when the last possible coin has been
borrowed from the Savings Bank, and the
last possible stiver of overdraft has been
acquired from the banks, and the final loan
has been floated with the Commonwealth
Government, and the small assets of the
lunatic and the orphan have been replaced
by the State Government’s IOU —then there
will be nothing left for Plolman except to say
that he has a bad pain in his stomach, and
is forced, through ill-health, to retire from
his magnificent job of saving the country.
During the three months —July, August ana
September—the Holman Government spent
£2,568,264 of loan money, which was at the
rate of well over £10,000,000 a year, whereas
in the corresponding quarter of 1913 tne
loan money went out at the rate of a little 1
over £8,000.000 a year. The pace is too
hot to last. Somewhere over £4,OOO,UUU oi
trust funds have been borrowed. The Gov-
ernment has a scrap of borrowed cash in
London with which to pay part of the next
instalment of interest on the vast and won-
derful public debt, but the amount it owes
to banks in Australia is nearly £2OU,UUU
more than the loan money it has to its
credit in London. Its remaining assets
consist of: (1) its unspeakable cheek; (-1
its boundless assurance; (3) its habit of
posing as the one possible Pecksniff of the
country; (4) its large professions of politi-
cal honesty; and (5) its proud conviction
that it is the only pebble on the
beach. But people who take the


trouble to add up figures have a suspicion
that it is another South Sea Bubble,
or Mississippi Company, or scheme for
extracting sunshine out of cucumbers, or
corporation for digging gold out of pavifig-
stones, or republic of Poyais. Poyais was
it Central American swamp which a wild
financier advertised as a republic, and the
loan was floated, and the floater got away
with the loan, and neither the lean nor the
floater has been seen since; and even the
location of the swamp is Uncertain-.
The Australian Remount.
Fob years this paper has been calling for
the institution of stud farms in Australia, at
which the systematic breeding of army re-
mounts might be carried on. The natural
tendency of the various Federal Adminis-
trations during the peaceful past has been
to regard the proposal with the cold eye of
dislike. It involved the expenditure of a
lot of money and no immediate return in the
vital matter of votes. Defence Minister
Peakce was the first to move in the business,
but the Cook Government, possibly because
it was pledged to anti-Socialism, possibly
because it has always evidenced a genius for-
doing the wrong thing in Defence matters,
had no use whatever for State haras.
Joseph Cook and his followers looked upon
Government-owned horse-breeding establish-
ments not only as unjustifiable interferences
with Private Enterprise, but as superfluities.
Sydney and Melbourne are full, just now, of
horses that have been collected from all over
the country for the use of the Expeditionary
Forces. This paper does not rvish to com-
ment in a hostile spirit on the animals.
But it asks the public to consider
in an impartial spirit the horseflesh
that has come to town, and to say
whether the same is worthy, by and large,
of Australia’s past reputation in this respect.
In particular let the public cast a critical
eye on the artillery horses, remembering that
the Allies and their enemies in Europe pay
particular attention to the animals which are
used by this arm of the service. When the
public have finished their scrutiny they re-
quire to remind themselves that the horses
which they have viewed represent the pick
of this country’s broken remounts. The ex-
Minister for Defence amassed most of them
by getting in touch with the great pastoral
companies and setting their agents to work
as buyers in up-country centres, all over the
Commonwealth. Even if it should be decided
that the animals which Australia is sending
away are up to the European level, it has to
be remembered that they are limited in
number. Furthermore, the present meagre
supply must be depleted in the months to
come. Indian and other buyers are working
overtime, the demand for horses having
more than doubled in the Asiatic countries
up north since the war began. The question
arises, in all the circumstances: Has Aus-
tralia any right to delay longer the task
which should have been undertaken 10 years
ago—that being about the time when it be-
came apparent that the operations of foreign
buyers; the drain of the Boer War; and
the haphazard methods of local breeders
were prejudicially affecting this country’s
horse supply? The Russian Government
thinks nothing of giving a fortune for a sire
like Galtee More. The French have spent
millions on their State breeding establish-
ments, on the purchase of sires, and on the
encouragement of racing. Germany has done
much, in the same direction, in the last 20
years, and there is evidence that it is already
regretting bitterly that it did not do more —
the Allies’ superiority, as regards remounts,
being one of the supreme difficulties with
which the Fatherland has to contend at the
present time. Australia possesses, in the
Northern Territory and elsewhere, unique
sites for the establishment of State luiras.
The soil and the climate’ are alike ideal for
the purposes of horse-breeding on a large
scale. What an anomaly it is, when, all
these things are considered, that the
Commonwealth should still be going for the
best of its remounts to butchers’ carts and
drapers’ vans.
The Beautiful Prospect that Arises
Before “Leading Merchants.”
The suggestion has been made in London that, in
order to protect British and trade after
the war, leading Australian merchants should
agree with England, Canada and South Africa to
refuse to buy German and Austrian goods for five
yea rs.
There you find Freetrade going strong and
Private Enterprise shouting at the top of
its voice! Why should “leading Australian
merchants” interfere in the matter, instead
of the Government taking a hand in the
struggle, and doing its duty on a simple busi-
ness basis? Nobody will import German or
Austrian goods for five years, or five cen-
turies, after the war, or import any parti-
cular country’s goods for 5,000,000 years
after the war, unless it pays to do so. But
if the fool of a tariff makes it profitable to
import cheap-labor goods from Germany
and Austria the day after the war —and
these ruined places will be cheap-labor coun-
tries for quite a while after the war—then
leading merchants must import the goods or
else go down in the rush of competition, and
cease to lead. The big jobber in softgoods
or ironware who sacrifices himself on the
altar of patriotism will find his connection
pass into the hands of Schwabe, now a mere
commission agent, and Schmidt, who does
a humble indent business in a one-roomed
office up three flights of stairs, these people
having no compunction about passing off the
products of the enemy, who isn’t really their
enemy. So Schwabe and Schmidt, of Mel-
bourne and Sydney, will become rich, while
the present race of merchant princes drift
towards the Benevolent Asylum. The latter
crowd will be in the same position as the
prominent burglar who agrees, on patriotic
grounds, not to break into the house or office
or shop of any British citizen. For want of
houses to break into he will presently be
reduced to searching for crusts in dust-boxes,
while the imported German burglar breaks
into any place, and takes anything or every-
thing, and lives on the beef and gravy of the
land. It is a cold proposition that the loyal-
ist should cut himself off from a profitable
branch of business while the disloyalist makes
all the money. A strenuous Protective tariff,
which shut out foreign goods in a large,
general way, would be of much more value
than an agreement among “leading mer-
chants.” It would put everybody on the
same footing, whereas the brilliant proposal
which comes from London is really to the
effect that the pro-British importer shall
commit suicide so that the anti-British one
may boom exceedingly.
♦
The Patriotic and Altogether Helpful
Attitude of the Marine Insurance
Combine.
If any one institution comes more inglori-
ously than another out of the turmoil into
which commerce has been thrown by the
war, it is surely the Insurance Trust. The
marine underwriters’ first move when the
great disturbance began was to hoist their
rates from 7s. 6d. (plus the ordinary war-
risk tag of Is.) to £2O in the £IOO. The busi-
ness life-blood of Australia, like that of
every other low-tariff country, is a matter,
largely, of foreign trade. The immediate
and inevitable effect of the imposition of
the £2O rate was to slay both importing and
exporting. For a trader to be able to pay
£2O on £IOO worth of goods was so painfully
impracticable that the British Government
dashed into the business, and, by declaring
a Socialistic rate of three guineas per cent.,
saved the situation. The insurance cos.
and private underwriters are now trying to
evade their equitable obligations in another
direction. Many ships started for Australia
when war was first threatened, and even
after it had been declared, with cargoes
which were especially insured against war-
risks. Some of the goods were very heavily
insured. A number carried the blackmailing
rate of 20 per cent. —these were perishable
stuffs, or the spring fashions for women, or
other articles which had either to be de-
livered promptly or scrapped. When a
merchantman is at sea, and its country of
origin is at war, it is faced with an obvious
duty to itself, to its native land, to the
owners and insurers of the cargo aboard, and
to its crew, and that duty is to evade the
enemy’s battleships. Certain Common-
wealth-bound vessels took that step. But
to do it they had to leave their usual course,
and in every insurance policy there is a
clause contracting that if a ship leaves its
ordinary route the policy shall thereby be
nullified. The spirit of such an arrange-
ment is obvious to the feeblest intelligence.
Clearly it does not mean that the people
who have paid their insurance money should
lose their rights because the boat which bore
their goods happened to learn of the upris-
ing of a volcanic island, and took a devious
course in order to avoid a fatal collision
with the unexpected obstruction. As well
penalise the owner, trainer, jockey and
backers of a horse because it was pulled
out half a dozen yaids to prevent it from
tumbling over another animal which had
fallen in front of it. All the evidence, how-
ever, goes to indicate that the underwriters
intend to battle for their full pound of flesh.
They will neither pay on the cargoes which
have gone astray, nor admit any liability in
the matter. On the other hand, they don’t
explicitly deny that they are liable. And,
finally, with the apparent object of involving
things as much as is humanly possible, they
caused to be published, the other day, a
legal opinion to the effect that they were
not liable for a farthing as regards the
cargoes of those ships which had gone out
of their ordinary course to avoid capture
or destruction. In desperation several of
the victims inquired, ultimately, whether
there was any hope of a rebate in regard to
the preposterous 20 per cent, rate —one which,
to be equitable, would have required that
one in every five ships, out and home, should
be seized or sunk. The insurance cos. did
not deny that the rate was criminally un-
fair —in point of fact, they couldn’t, since
they have long since brought their own rate
down to the neighborhood of the British
Government’s figures above quoted. They
merely mentioned blandly that in this respect
there would be nothing whatever doing, and
they left it at that. It may be all per-
fectly good business, but it bears no more
relation to ordinary fair play than card-
sharping does.
Certain Postal Troubles and an
Objurgation.
For two weeks in succession The Bulle-
tin’s theatrical pictures from Melbourne
have arrived a day late. The third week
the artist made a special effort and posted
them on Saturday, whereupon the Post Office
made a special effort and delivered them on
Thursday. The Bulletin’s most reliable
junior clerk sat around the Post Office
premises, like Lazarus sitting at the door
of Greatness, and didn’t get the goods. He
felt like the dog which is described in Holy
Writ as waiting for the cartoons which fall
from the rich man’s table. The most accom-
plished curser on the staff went to push the
inquiry. He was received in a most polite
fashion, for which he is grateful; but the
only information he acquired was the infor-
mation that there wasn’t any information.
In such a case the one satisfaction which
anybody can get lies in taking it out of the
hide of the miscreant who is responsible,
whoever that miscreant may be. He is
possibly someone named Schmidt. He is
hereby denounced on general principles with
the greater and lesser excommunication. He
is handed over to the high justice, and the
middle, and the low ; also to the Inquisition
and the dogs and the wolves. This paper
trusts devoutly that -his bigamy may be
found out, and that his embezzlements may
appear in the garish light of day; that he
may be revealed as a .German spy and shot
some cold morning before breakfast, and
then torn to pieces by wild horses, and fined
2s. 6d., and imprisoned for life, and burned
alive; also that his bull-terrier may be
stolen, that his hens may lay in the next
man’s yard, that his razor may be blunt,
that his wife may bolt, and that his roof
may be blown off. If he has any savings
it is desired, without prejudice, that the
institution which holds them may go broke
and pay a first, last and final dividend of
2d. in the £ about the year 1952. The
Bulletin respectfully calls down on him
tight boots, ill-fitting clothes, corns, un-
grateful children, a hard landlord, leaky gas,
lack of employment, jim-jams, burglars,
snakes in his back yard, pedlars, book can-
vassers, fire, flood, hollow teeth, and unpaid
bills. It asks that a tree may fall on him,
and that he may go mad with a specially-
gibbering species of madness, and that all
his relatives may go mad also; and
that his cat may go raving mad and rush
up the chimney, making a fearful scatter of
the ashes, and then, failing to keep hold of
things with its claws, may fall down into
the cookery and hopelessly wreck the ham
and eggs with its hindquarters. And, in
conclusion, a supplication is offered up that
the legs may come off all his tables, chairs,
sofas, couches, bedsteads and pianos; that
his back fence may fall down; that his ash-
barrel may overflow, his sink be stopped up
and his stove-pipe be blocked; that his cow
may wander; that every time he puts out
his shoes to be cleaned they may be stolen
or have water poured into them; that he
may fall over a sleeping turkey when he
goes forth in the dark; that he may be
brayed at by stray asses; and that he
may be struck by 13 thunderbolts on a
Friday. And if the Postal Department
doesn’t reform and deliver the goods
in reasonable time this publication will
become angry and call down on it something
really bad —something that will amount to
serious annoyance.
♦
“M.A.,” his heresy :
Chief Justice Cullen is the Senate’s pick as Chan-
cellor of Sydney University via; Dr. MacLaurin,
deceased. Judge Backhouse, many years vice-Chan-
cellor, would have had a mortgage on the job, but he
is only a District Court horse-tail, and Precedent
would have funked had he been promoted over a
Senate bristling with Supreme Court and High Court
Judges. It was recognised that the official see-saw
of Sydney University between Law and Medicine
demanded a Judge of some kind —and, naturally, the
State Chief Justice was nominated. The new Chan-
cellor possesses the necessary stock-in-trade of erudi-
tion, social position and public career; but, to my
way of looking at it. some of these things are positive
disadvantages. The Sydney University is not the
power and force in the life of the State that it ought
to be. It is a highly expensive institution to main-
tain, and its potential influence isn’t realised by
results. By a curious way of reasoning, the destinies
of this great institution are left wholly in the hands
of an honorary chancellor and an honorary Senate,
who are supposed to guide them in their spare time.
(The finances of the concern are left to the pare of
Unpaid senators.) The real need of Sydney Univer-
sity is a vigorous paid Chancellor, not afraid of d
rbw, whb will shake lip the dry bones of the place
and breathe life into it. Such a job is beyond, and
rightly beyond; the exalted Chief Justice of the
State, who must necessarily keep above party strife,
and who has his own important work to attend to.
A less exalted and imposing Chancellor, if a fighter,
would really suit better. But this wouldn’t suit the
Senate. To criticise its mistakes you first have
to criticise the Chancellor, and when the disrespectful
critic tries to do so, the amazed Senate says:
“How dare you speak so of the Chief Justice?” But
if the Chancellor was a highly-paid public servant he
couldn’t shelter the Senate behind his ermine robe.
Even a State kindergarten isn't run with an unpaid,
irresponsible body, able to escape conviction of bad
stewardship.

Private Enterprise has just been given
another fine advt. Though artesian water
is a national asset, Private Enterprise has
been allowed to handle it just at it pleased
—could tap it where and how and in as
many places as it liked, and if it got 300,000
gallons a day, and wanted only 50,000 gal-
lons, it could (and, as a matter of fact, did)
let the other 250,000 gallons run to waste,
and nobody had a right to say a word of
reproach to the vandal. The Government let
the thing slide, chiefly because the artesian
waste is a long way off, and there, wasn’t
anybody to raise a loud howl about it. But
Nature rebelled at last, and, according to
the report of an inter-State conference of
departmental water-bosses, the rebellion is
serious enough to make somebody jump. In
N. S. Wales there are 388 flowing wells, and
351 of them have been gauged, the figures
showing that, whereas till the last few
years the flow fell oft 54 per cent,
per annum as an average, the shrink-
age has now reached 8 per cent. Even
if things don’t get any worse this
means that in another seven years the bores
will be giving, on the average, only half their
present supply; and having uncorked this
problem, the conference admits that it doesn’t
know what to do with it. All it knows for
certain is that the problem wouldn’t have
been half the devil it is if P. Enterprise
hadn’t been given a free hand to punch the
earth as it liked and waste the proceeds as
it pleased.
The present war is the first war of
starvation that any great European Power
has met with. Until a comparatively recent
period Germany not only fed itself, but had
surplus victuals for export. Now, by reason
of improvements in sanitation and medical
science, the population has grown beyond
the food supply,- and Germany imports a
great part of its daily breakfast and dinner,
just as the British Islands do. Austria got
over the speed limit more recently, but it is
also now an importer instead of an exporter
of that which man puts into his mouth three
times a day to steal away the coating of his
stomach. The two countries which are mak-
ing all the trouble are in a curious position.
Kussia doesn’t furnish them with wheat
and cow-meat any more. The British and
French fleets block their supplies by sea.
If they had been a little more civil to the
Balkan States they might have got supplies
from the south, but the Balkan States are
mostly unpleasant, not to say hostile. Also
they are afraid to commit themselves. Italy
is cold. Switzerland is prepared to sell tons
of brummy clocks and watches, but it can’t
do piuch in the shape of oatmeal. The hos-
tile Powers can live a long while by eating
up their stock of bulls and hogs, but the food
supply is diminishing all the time. If the
trouble lasts for three vears it will probably
be known as the Hunger Struggle.

If Sydney sees a bony young man rushing
from the Treasury, with straws in his long
hair, it will know that the gibbering skele-
ton in the cupboard has got Willy Hol-
man beaten. That cheerful borrower in
millions made the dreadful mistake of at
last spending before he borrowed; then the
din of war made Cohen quite deaf, and
William Holman knew he had struck much
the same sort of trouble that faces the
young man whose “sure thing” runs stiff
after he has borrowed from the boss’s till
to back the brute. During the past three
months £2,338,000 of the last loan came
from London; but it had nearly all been
pawned before it left the pawnbroker, so
there isn’t a stiver of it in the N.S.W.
Treasury. Worse still, in anticipation of
loans, the non-borrowing N.S.W. Labor Gov-
ernment “employed” various trust funds,
amounting to £4,621,430; in fact, after it
had used all the trust funds, it got an over-
draft on the off-chance of more trust funds
being presently available to collar, so that in
the till where the £4,621,430 of trust funds
came from there is now only a crumpled
piece of paper—“lOU £4,793,457.” In
short, the non-borrowing Government has
used up all its loan money and all its trust
funds, and is now competing with the sub-
urban grocer for small and uncertain bank
overdrafts ; and it stands in the pitiful posi-
tion of a non-borrower that not only bor-
rowed every penny it could, but actually
spent the money in advance, and then
emptied the Treasury of trust funds in the
expectation of being able to borrow more.
At that stage the European bomb exploded
and the Government couldn’t borrow any
more. Whereupon Holman, the man who
has led the country into the awful bog, and
incidentally thrown the principles of his
party overboard, admits that the position
isn’t quite comfortable.
Sydney Telegraph got back to something
like its old form the other morning, and
cursed “the new Caucus Government” for
carrying out its pledge to make the Protec-
tion of the Customs tariff a little less of a
joke. The Labor party, the Telegraph
says, “joined in the protest against going on
with the elections when the Empire was em-
broiled in war” ; which meant that the party
believed this was “a time when party differ-
ences should be sunk and partv questions put
aside.” Hence, in now proposing to revise
the tariff, “the Government’s insincerity is
cynically attested,” and there is “a callous
breach of unmistakably implied faith.” It
is all very dreadful; but what are the facts?
The Telegraph proposed that in some way
or other the elections should be post-
poned. Some of the Labor leaders, believing
,that it was no time for a party fight, approved

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Olympic games are due in Berlin in 191 G.
—News item.
On the marshy plain beside the River Spree
Will be played the newest of Olympic
games,
When the Brandenburgs march past in
misery
To atone for giving half a world to flames.
Past the Schlossbrucke they are marching
To the lime trees fragrant arching,
Along Unter der Linden to the games.
From the Schloss Platz on the Island they’ll
be driven,
By the Ivonigsgratzerstrasse with proud
heads bowed,
And the insolence departed of the Partner up
in Heaven,
And the God of Brandenburgers dis-
allowed.
When they march through Sorrow’s flames
To the new Olympic games
Through the menace of a smitten, snarling
crowd.
The Friedriclistrasse wild curses at them
flings,
And the monument of Victory’s draped in
black,
When the poor who live in cellars crawl out
to see the kings
Whom they bore like fools for years upon
their back —
Whom they furnished bed and board,
Whom they shielded with a sword,
Lacking all themselves that they might
nothing lack.
All the factories that fashioned steel and
brass —
That made the Prussian strong enough to
fight,
While the foolish, purblind, trustful English
ass
Freetrade accepted in his own despite,
They are silent industries,
And their men, beat to their knees,
Curse the Painted Lath for whom they
went to fight.
His sires were rangets of the Prussian
woods,
Then money-lenders on the River Spree;
Thieves and reivers of the traveller and his
goods
And the ancient Three Ball Game played
perfectly.
And that Highway King orated
Till his head was well inflated
When he and God reigned jointly on the
Spree.
I shall see Olympia New at old Berlin,
When the Kaiser and some kings are out
of work,
In the unemployed procession for their sin,
When the god of war goes southward to
the Turk,
And the kings and all their chanters
And the bishops and the ranters
Turn sadly to the fact of honest work.
They will be Olympic games for more than
men,
The camel and the tiger and the snake,
All the qualities of kaisers shown us then,
And a penalty of like for like we’ll make;
And you’ll see the Kaiser there,
A-grooming for the bear,
And doing similar service for the snake.
He shall manicure the elephant at dawn,
He shall curl bears’ whiskers by the mid-
night flames,
And his shop shall take quite worthless things
in pawn,
And he’ll curse the Nineteen-sixteen
’Lympic Games,
When the kings all out of work,
In the camel pens shall lurk,
Fearful of their crime that gave the world
to flames.

of this, and elaborated a scheme by which
the thing might be done. The idea was,
however, turned down by Joe Cook and the
Liberals, and the elections went ahead. Now
the Telegraph has the brassy impudence to
throw gutter language at the whole Labor
party for not observing the implied terms
of an alleged compact (which never was a
compact) turned down by the Telegraph’s
own political crowd. In any case, what does
it matter? Joe Cook and the Telegraph
promised tariff reform. Since then it
appears that it is “a callous breach of
unmistakably implied faith” to help Joe
Cook and the Telegraph fulfil their own
pledges? This somersaulting becomes
bewildering.
O
From The Bulletin’s own war-correspon-
dent in the back yard:—
Gentlemen, stand by and hear me speak: It is
good to live in these days even though we die to-
morrow. The war has become chaotic —a phantas-
magoria without coherency which has got quite out
of the hands of the men who are supposed to direct
it. The vast torrent of events has swept the
captains off their feet, and the gigantic swirl of cir-
cumstance is made up of little eddies of sudden
impulse. But how dramatic it all is ! In the north-
west of France are two great fortified areas, from
which a million men attack a million men, with vary-
ing fortunes. Far away, right across Central Europe,
men are making war, not in armies, but nations.
Whole battalions cross over to the Slav, and are
officially accounted for as “prisoners.” The condemned
German puts up a magnificent fight, stained with
horrible atrocities, with the daily growing conviction
that he is doomed. Long ago, after much careful
thought, he builded a chain of fortresses along the
Russian border. But when the Russian came he sat
down in front of those fortresses, and gazed hungrily
at them in such, numbers that garrisons and supports
had to be kept at full strength. And while he gazed
vaster armies poured through Galicia and swept the
struggling llapsgurg before them. The Rusians’
plan was simple but effective. When they
met an army of a million they attacked
it in the front with a million, and sent half a million
more round on either wing to enfold it. Then whole
brigades of Slay regiments crossed over bodily to the
invader, and defeats degenerated into routs, and routs
into sheer butcheries, and butcheries swelled so that
after one battle 35,000 wounded had to be abandoned
because there was no organisation to succor them.
Think of it! Austrian armies became demoralised.
Whole provinces welcomed the invaders with open
arms, glad to be rid of the yoke of the Teuton.
Gradually but surely the great chain of fortresses
along the Russian frontier became useless, because
when the Russian enters Germany it will not be from
Poland, but from the south through Bohemia and
Upper Austria. From that vantage point he can
either advance northward on Berlin and split the
empire in two, or he can press westward to meet the
Anglo-French forces. And all the while the wave of
Bears in front of those fortresses will grow higher
and higher as successive waves of Bears roll up from
the dim, distant eastern Russian Empire. The Bear
from Turkestan and the Bear from Siberia have
scarcely begun to arrive yet. Yes, it is good to live
in these titanic days, even if one cannot collect his
accounts, and soulless caitiffs jam his tail with appli-
cations for orders in the District Court. Fortu-
nately, the District Court has also got one eye fixed
on the drama in Europe and murmurs, absent-
mindedly, “Thirty bob per month, with the right to
have the order varied if this war makes the circum-
stances worse!”
The other day statistician Knibbs curtly
told the Commonwealth that for lack of
adequate Protection it was rapidly going to
the devil. Also he threw a gibe at the
gradual inter-State Commission. He didn’t
put his conclusions in these exact words,
but what he did say was equally disrespect-
ful. He stated that in 1913 Australia spent
£79,749,653 on goods partly or wholly manu-
factured abroad, while it exported only
£75,090,147 worth. The shameful part of
the business is that nine-tenths of those im-
ports should have been manufactured here,
practically the whole of the raw material
from which they were made having been
originally produced in Australia.
Quite a sensational event was the bump-
ing of the Adelaide Co.’s passenger steamer
Marloo, off Sandy Cape (Q.), on September
26. At about 5 a.m. the vessel was splurg-
ing through a calm sea at full speed, when
she hit the earth and ripped a section of her
bottom out; but. her bulkheads held long
enough to enable her to be beached. Wire-
less not being available, one of the ship’s
officers made a hazardous trip to a neigh-
borly lighthouse and summoned help; and
the passengers were rescued by the Dutch
packet Tasman. Three months ago the fact
that an inter-State liner had torn most of
her bottom out and so imperilled the whole
human cargo would have filled most of a
page of the daily press. But the occurrence,
not having the remotest connection with the
war, shared the oblivion of the Earle Her-
mann case, the M.L. earthquake, the Eve-
leigli robbery trial and similar sensational
happenings. They were small potatoes, and
they occurred when the war-cable operator
was busy avoiding what he had despatched
last week.

“The Girl in the Taxi” is still at Her
Majesty’s, but there are brighter days for
Sydney coming. On next Saturday week the
Gilbert and Sullivan season begins. -
* * *
“Sweet Nell of Old Drury” continues to
sell oranges at Sydney Royal. Nell is in-
teresting because she belongs to an age when
the present fruit baron stayed in his native
Italy and employed himself exclusively with
vendettas, stilettos, signorinas and . other
national amusements. But the invention of
cheap travel, soda fountains, ice-cream,
barrel-organs and monkeys destroyed the
economic balance of power, and the fas-
cinating English orange-girl disappeared.
** * *
No international complications are . ex-
pected at the Criterion after Friday, since
on Saturday the Russian melodrama, “The
Yellow Ticket,” will give place to “Seven
Keys to Baldpate,” a new sort of farce, in
which the ever-welcome Fred Niblo and
Josephine Cohan will reappear. As this
paper goes to press there is no intimation
that Baldpate is likely to give up its neu-
trality to join the Entente, nor is there the
remotest sign on the bellicose horizon of the
issue of an ultimatum to Baldpate even by
Montenegro. The Censor can therefore have
his Saturday evening off.
** * *
On Saturday night “The Glad Eye” will
be on view at the Palace under the manipu-
lation of the Beaumont Smith-Louis Meyer
management.
* * * *
The Anderson season at the Palace (Syd-
ney) will put the peg in to-morrow night,
when the Face will adorn the Window as it
has been doing all the week. It is a pity
the Countenance is not given the attention
of distraction-seekers it deserves. Tons of
money are being thrown away on high-
charge shows that return l/10th the joy
of Bilanderson’s cheap-price murderama.
* * * *
There’s a long beer waiting at the corner
pub for the Adelphi. The big bellowdrama
theatre has decided, on account of the large
vacancy in the public’s purse, to carve one
half off all its prices, so that, until things
improve, anything from 6d. to 2s. will see the
Worst Girl in London dragged through the
mud by the Most Accomplished Villain in
the World. “The Rosary” will be paid off
to-morrow night, and on Saturday “The Ever
Open Door” is due—at the same price for
you and the girl that it used to run into for
yourself alone.
AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Fatima , wriggle expert, who came to Australia
expressly to dodge the Sultan of Turkey.
The two-sliows-a-day at the Tivoli have
settled down into a confirmed habit, and
members of Parliament now have an oppor-
tunity of taking a change and filling in an
afternoon at something besides dominoes.
Just at present Westony, a Spanish pianist
with a very large reputation; Fatima, a
dancer with a very small wardrobe ; and Dusty
Rhodes and Al. Herman are the big items
on a programme that still seems excellent
in spite of Cinquevalli’s departure. And a
programme which can suffer that loss and
not at once seem as weak as Lapland’s navy
must be a mighty good programme indeed.
u' v 'i' 'c
The “big” night of next week at the
Imperial Salon de Luxe (which reposes at
the hocks of William-street, Sydney) is to
be a military and naval ball on Wednesday
in aid of the dependents of those who were
lost in Australia’s submarine AEI. Mean-
while the merinos who have been down for
the races have been looking in and showing
the dancers some quite new steps.
Revivals of “The Silver King” by the
J.C.W. firm remind one of the traditional
Scotchman’s idea regarding whiskies. Some
are better than others, but none are bad.
The Julius Knight brand, now being served
at Melb. Royal, is not bad, but it is not
one of the best in acting or staging. For
instance, the Skittle Alley of the Wheat-
sheaf pub (Alley is spelt “Ally” on the
programme, another consequence, no doubt,
oi the war) suggests a bit of ducal park
rather than a cockney back yard. The per-
formance is weak in many places, and power-
ful nowhere except in Knight’s delivery of
the famous speech which is modelled on the
Shakspearian lines of Clarence s Dream.
Further, the most noticeable changes or
omissions from the original of this classic
melodrama are disimprovements. lhe
Spider of old used to excuse his predatory
practices with the argument that “the duck
gobbles the worm, then the man gobbles the
duck, and then the worm gobbles the man ;
but Captain Skinner last Saturday night
spoke of the duck eating-up the worm, and
the worm swallowing the man. Also he
remarked that Mr. Cripps in his wrath had
“the ferocity of the British Dion in mortal
combat,” tlie additional _ words “with the
apochryphal unicorn” being left out. Due
Bulletin thought of those missing words,
and wondered whether they had been sup-
pressed by the war censor in consideration
of their flippant reference to Britain’s coat-
of-arms. Is it that the unicorn ceases to be
anochryphal when the Empire is roused?
Mr. Parkyn, the town clerk of Gladdesden,
has in the present production a thin, feeble
voice which couldn’t possibly account for his
reading of the Psalms to be greatly admired
bv the Lord Bishop of the diocese.. so the
allusion to the Psalms and the Bishop is
omitted, likewise the tail-end of his account
of the scene in court at a murder trial.
Evidently the resources of the co. were un-
equal to the supply of a town clerk, with a
rich, sonorous' voice. TTnequalitv. in fact,
was a striking characteristic of this popular
revival.
“THE WORST WOMAN IN LONDON
AT SYDNEY PALACE.
The peaceful bedroom scene , showing corpse,
murderess, would-be murderer, and the long
arm of the law.
Julius Knight, as Wilfred Denver, rather
lacks abandon in his drunk-and-remorseful
melancholy of demeanor when he becomes a
bloated capitalist from Nevada. But he
is a pleasing hero, as usual. Miss
Browne, as a deadly-pale, hobble-skirted
Nellie, is more of a picturesque actress in
distress than a pathetic figure of domestic
virtue battling with adversity. The Jaikes
of Eardley Turner is good and hard enough;
the Spider (Frank Harvey) swaggers . un-
necessarily ; and Robert Whyte, jun., is a.
tame Father Christmas, who pushes himself
along a foot at a time, like an infant im-
personator of a “puff-puff.” Martin Lewis,
as the short-lived Geoffrey Ware, is more
satisfactory than Leslie Victor (Corkett) or
Bentley (Baxter). Miss Dorothy Gumming,
as Olive Skinner, has no more emotional
force than a pretty lady on a fashion plate,
whilst a dozen people in minor character
parts call for no special remark either way.
“Silver King” is for 12 nights, _ and
then comes “The Argyle Case,” with a
newly-assorted company.
“Gipsy Love,” at Her Majesty’s (Melb.),
has reached the last-nights period of its
melodious career. Considered as an operatic
story it grows more foolish on closer
acquaintance, but the music reveals new
charms, so the sum total of effect remains
the same as at first.
Commencing at 8.20, concluding at 10.30,
and containing two large adjournments and
the same number of tableaux, “Mr. Wu,” at
the Melbourne Princess’s, hardly affords that
potentate more than an hour and a half
wherein to make the house of Gregory miser-
able. There never was a miscreant who
does less than Wu to justify a reputation
for Chow cunning and malevolence. To
be sure, the audience gets a view of his
myrmidons’ seizure of Gregory, jun., and his
threatening belfavior to_ the young man s
parents is pictured with a fair measure
of detail; but the alleged murder of
his daughter and the scuttling of old
Gregory’s steamer are merely mentioned in
post-mortem references, as it were, by self-
deputed coroners. The best act is the last,
depicting the well-known Tosca-Scarpia
business with Chinese trimmings; but _ the
scene is overburdened with kow-tow, joss-
worship and irrelevant conversation, with
the result that the lady’s howls of distress
are unnecessarily extended, and Wu’s de-
praved gloat is prolonged at least a quarter
of an hour after the congregation feels it
ought to be reaching for its hat. ‘ Mr.
Wu” is not a convincing entertainment, all
things considered, but the scenery is ade-
quate, and the “atmosphere” is as strong as
a profusion of pagodas, yellow menials and
similar sundries can make it. As regards
the acting, it may be remarked that
the “fat” is unevenly divided among
two or three people, while a crowd
of mostly competent people have to
scramble for the bones, so to speak. Mum-
mers like Alf Scarlett and Harry Sweeney
are furnished with about half a dozen lines
and a very limited allowance of limelit pub-
licity ; while an old hand like Harry Halley
does a silent live-minute turn as a pigtail
clerk, and Miss Pressy Preston has to play
three acts of dumb support wearing a
depressed, dyspeptic air and a suit of black
nvjamas. Miss Beatrice Day is an eihcient
Mrs. Gregory, and Miss Esther Mitchell
easily escapes critical remonstrance as Nang
Ping. Wykeham, as Gregory, senior, ranges
from loud to deafening as' the desire for
emphasis takes him; Cyril Mackay’s study of
the remorseful young Gregory is manly in
the beginning, but rather moist in the con-
clusion ; and Arthur Styan, as Wu, is a
somewhat Heavy, disjointed person given to
British haircuts, Chinese clothes and
demonstrations of annoyance at any
rude allusion to his ancestors. it
might also be mentioned that he is
very pious, and the amount of praying he
indulges in before bestowing his indelicate
attentions on Mrs. Gregory seems to suggest
that he regards this part of the proceedings
as a religious ceremony.
Produced on a large stage, with an ade-
quate garden scene and a well-chosen cast of
characters, Galsworthy’s “Joy” would make
a strong appeal to that small section of the
public which has thoughts to think and is
not mentally bound by the leaden rules of
conventional morality. The play is. quite
artless in construction, and devoid of com-
mercial instinct. Its episodes, however, are
intensely real. Joy is the 16-year-old
daughter of a charming woman —impulsive,
pleasure-loving and “romantic” —who has
attached another man to herself since her
husband left her to her own devices. Joy’s
father, presumably, was a bad lot. Never-
theless, the maiden, on leaving boarding-
school, nurses a jealous hatred of the other
fellow, because he seems fonder of her pretty
mamma than she, Joy, thinks that mamma
ought to let him be. When the matured
lovers are staying at the house of the lady’s
uncle, young Joy flares up against them.
She proves her severely-maidenly suspicions
to be correct. Uncle and other, friends and
relations frown furtively on the liaison. The
exceptional Christian is an old governess who
reckons that love is love, and propriety some-
times deserves modification. Finally, the
20-year-old sweetheart of the angry, guile-
less flapper—the “untouched thing” who has
been more cruel, with less cause, than cold
Ellean to the Second Mrs. Tanqueray—hugs
Joy; and then, it seems, she thinks forgiv-
ingly of her mother’s weakness for a person
of the opposite sex. The play goes no
further than this suggestion. It is much too
strong in characterisation and passionate
altercation for amateurs to do it justice, but
Miss Ivy Wenzel, in the name parts, and
Mrs. Maurice Dudley, as her mother, were
pictorially interesting. Norman Carter pre-
sented a stodgy, illicit lover; and Miss
Herrick and Alan Mitchell were the best of
the other amateurs. All the “go” in the per-
formance was due to Gregan McMahon, as a
genial, egotistical old military man. The
actor’s staccato style came natural, to the
part; he put the right touch of feeling into
the picture, and his make-up was a work of
art.
** ❖ *
“Death or Glory Boys,” revived at the
King’s for reasons too obvious to mention, is
just the same old, serio-chronic concerning the
proud, spotless heroine, the gallant British
yeoman who got into trouble on account of
his poor young sister’s indiscretion, and the
sinful officah whose name in Andersonian
bellodrama is usually Beckett. The. heavy
father is a colonel, and the hero joins the
17th Lancers, so that he can be mostly escap-
ing from barracks he isn’t mowing
down the enemy. A small military force
departs from barracks for the African Desert,
and there one of the Death or Glory blokes,
with a respectable Irish voice, sings “Soldiers
of the King,” followed by “It’s a Long Way
to Tipperary” and other ditties, the audience
supporting the choruses with fine military
spirit. Then virtue comes out on top. and
Britannia Rules the Waves. Miss Wilton,
Miss Gresham, Maudie Goldspink, Conway,
Beckett, Stanford, Dawe, Temple Harrison
and some more are employed putting this bald
and unconvincing narrative through its paces.

HOW I CURED MY COLD!
(By a Melbourne Journalist.)
I am a literary man, and my work is more or less
sedentary. For years I used to catch cold at the I
least change in the weather. I tried swallowing drugs
—and my washstand looks like an apothecary's shop.
One day I met a man who had tried
“NAZETHA”
The Big Cold Cure in the Little Bottle.
He poured two tiny drops on my handkerchief, and I
snuffed the soothing, curing, refreshing ethers through
my nose. Marvellous! I exclaimed. 11 relieved the
pains in the head and throat, stopped the running
of the phlegm. I bought a bottle, and always carry
it in my breast pocket —and always use it at the
least sign of a cold. YOU try it. Insist on
“Nazetha” from the chemist.
There’s nothing just as good. J j (j Post Free.

Daisy Jerome is still at Melbourne Bijou,
where Henri French continues to disturb the
audience with his clever lunacies on foot and
wheel. Phil Percival, a singer and *anec-

At Hoyt’s Olympia the complications aris-
ing from a youth’s degraded effort to pass off
a sixpenny-bar acquaintance as a Hindu
Pundit are minutely related in “My Friend
from India.” The picture is adapted from
a popular Yankee farce, and unrolls many
humorous episodes during its 40-minutes’
journey. The top-line subjects at Hoyt’s
National, Bourke-street, are “In the Devil’s
Claws,” a four-reel thrill occurring in New
York, and “The Mystery of the White Car,”
a two-round contest between a female gun-
runner and a slow-witted detective.

Adelaide Tivoli has a strong bill, and the
big house gets audiences to match. Tom
Kelly has that “way wid him” which means
success in any of the arts that depend on a
public appeal. He can tell a quite ordinary
Irish story and get his house hysterical over
it. The Davenport ladies do their Daring
Barebacked Act of sculpture posing; and the
only Cinquevalli has just come in, promptly
welcomed with a vice-regal evening. The
King’s has a merry but less sensational bill,
including the Bartletts and the Carpos in
athletics, Benson and Bell dancing, Ed. Blon-
dell in one sketch, and the Irve Haymen Co.
in another. At the Royal Bert Bailey shows
himself an artist in anything he handles,
the new Captain Jogifer or the old familiar
Dad. He is well supported, especially
by Duggan and Macdonald and the new-
comer. Pearl Smith, whose assumption of an
incredible simplicity is convincing. At the
Town Hall the Fireflies —Gregory, McGowan,
little Maisie Posner and Co. —are doing well.
The Appendreena amateurs have repeated
Esmond’s “Eliza Comes to Stay,” with its
improbable story of the quick change of a
slattern into a beauty. Zoe Reid was again
the Protean Eliza, but von Treuer played the
hero, therein succeeding cricketer Chamber-
lain, who has moved to Sydney. Patriotic
concerts are everywhere. So are war pictures.
“A.M.W.” : Pekin would probably be more
perturbed than Paris by the recent news of
the German bombardment of Papeete. There
are several well-established British and
French trading firms in the town, but the
retail trade with the natives is in the hands
of the Chinese, who have been making a big
bid for the whole lot. Papeete used to be
Tahitian, then it became French, latterly in
effect it has been Chinese. The visitor who
takes the street in Papeete leading inland
from the wharf would be struck by the num-
ber of sleek Celestials standing at the open
doorway, spitting leisurely across the 18in.
pathway into the gutter. Chinese tailors
busily pedal sewing machines; Chinese bar-
bers deftly remove the stubble from Oriental
cheeks ; Chinese cookshops purvey the Tahi-
tian equivalent for birdnest soup. _ Every-
where it is Chinese. And they get rich; for
Ah Sin Cohen lends a ready ear to the
Tahitian who wants a motor-car, or a gram-
ophone, or a weatherboard house because, his
neighbor possesses these western luxuries;
and the Tahitian pledges his copra
crop and his vanilla crop (also, the vanilla
and copra crops of generations to come) in
order that the prodigal may steer his auto
round the maze-like arrangement of narrow
public passages called the Rue de Rivoli, the
Rue de Beaux Arts, etc. So rapidly is the
local Chinese population growing that,
lately, the established Chinese raised a howl
and demanded a cessation of immigration.
Evidently they feared that the vanilla crops
wouldn’t go round. But the French Govern-
ment turned an unsympathetic ear, and
smilingly replied, “Let ’em all come!”
AT POVERTY POINT.
From London : The Theatre flopped worse
than anything else when the war began.
Savoy, Ilaymarket, Prince of Wales, Duke
of York, Royalty, Aldwych, Opera House,
Lyric and Vaudeville all closed promptly.
Some of them would have closed in August
anyway, fashionable London being “out of
town” then. “Kismet,” “Mr. Wu,” “The
Great Adventui'e” and the revived “Belle of
New York” kept on steadily. Tree hurried
up a revival of “Drake,” profits to go to the
relief of the theatrical profession suffering
because of the war; and the profession
seems likely to need it, for many managers
of touring cos. simply cancelled all engage-
ments. Some cos. that tried to travel
found the railways so blocked by moving
troops that no scenery could be taken. The
music-halls hastily sent out for patriotic
songs and films, and most “artists” agreed
to take reduced salaries. Just at present
the motto “Carry on !” is being pressed, and
the suggestion made that every true patriot
should behave as though nothing in par-
ticular was happening.

“Harrison O.” : I will always admire the
cleverness with which English musical-
comedy girls succeed in being like each other;
but why do they do it? The latest imported
samples, on view in “Gipsy Love,” are
exactly the same as former consignments—
fluffy hair, a smile like Cook’s when he
started his last campaign, exhausted gestures,
and an air which suggests that its owner
would be afraid to cross Cemetery-street,
Geelong, on a Sunday afternoon, on account
of the violence of the traffic. The performer
must also wear a broad band tied across her
bead, and make her first entrance in a
summer costume of elaborate simplicity. No
English musical-comedy female would dream
of transgressing this last rule. In “Gipsy
Love,” for example, Lady Babby arrives m
the glad haberdashery of spring, immedi-
ately following a menial who has charge of
her hot-water bottle!
“Hamer”: An old disturbance between the
Sydney City Council and the Musicians’
Union is continuing. The discord was
first struck when the Musicians’ Union,
which claimed 10s. per man for park
performances and got an Arbitration award
of 7s. 6d., refused to tender or allow its
members to tender for the work of dispensing
harmony to the public. The Labor faction
in the Town Hail has fought on several occa-
sions to induce the Council to cough up the
extra half-crown, but that body has in-
structed the City Solicitor to oppose any
application by the union for an increase on
the award rates. Meanwhile, non-union bands
are supplying the park music, and Arbitra-
tion is at the old address on the Labor union-
ist’s platform.
On their return to Sydney from Maori-
land (where good business has been the
rule) Hugh Buckler and Violet Paget will
reappear at the Little Theatre in “Lord and
Lady Al'gy.” Features of the season will
be “The Admirable Crichton” and Shaks-
peare’s “Cymbeline.”
“Kaniva”: “Melb.” (B. 1/10/T4) falls
into the usual error of making St. George’s
Hall the place of Harry Richards’s first
appearance in Victoria. The fact is that
Rickards first showed at the old Princess’s
Theatre on Dee. 2, 1871, with his company,
viz.: Carrie Rickards, Lizzie Watson and
R. Ramsden, for the benefit of L. M. Bay-
less, who was husband to Mary Gladstone,
tragedienne. He arrived by the ship Lam-
mermuir on Nov. 28, so it will be seen that
Enderby Jackson, the manager, was not
slow in getting his troupe before the public.
I saw this show. “Piccadilly” was ’Arry’s
opening song. Seven days later, Dec. 9,
1871 (not 1872, as is the prevalent idea),
he made his first noise at St. George’s Hall.
“Harrison O.” : Have now and then heard
complaints of the insipid, lily-like, Bel-
gravian beau who is usually the hero of
musical comedy, but having, in “Gipsy
Love,” encountered another variety of hero,
I am well content to go on putting up with
the Percy type. The new offering is a gipsy
fiddler who doesn’t fiddle, but wears his hair
long, swanks like an actor, makes love by
the simple method of being invariably rude,
dresses in the absurdly pretentious manner
of a stage secret conspirator, and talks like
Petruchio while looking like Antonio da
Oyst. In amorous moments he shouts and
hisses; at other times he hisses and shouts.
A more boorish, loud-voiced, insanitary-look-
ing hero I have not met, and the adoration
which matinee girls are alleged to entertain
for him is, to me, a mystery—possibly be-
cause I am not a matinee girl.
“Gazer”: Re the yarn (B. 24/9/T4) that
German music professors in Melbourne are
showing anti-British feeling and an arrogant
Prussian spirit. The writer is obviously not
even remotely acquainted with Melbourne
German musicians. To begin with, there is
not a single Prussian amongst them. They
are all Bavarians and Saxons, who hate the
Prussians mortally. Furthermore., every
well-known German musician practising in
Melbourne is married to an Australian, and
owns a host of Australian family connec-
tions. One German musician’s son has been
in training at Duntroon since it was estab-
lished. Another’s son was so infatuated
with his Australian uniform that he wore it
while receiving visitors at his exhibition of
paintings. A third, after 20 years’ absence
from the Vaterland, took a trip to Europe,
but so dear had the British habit become to
him that he only stayed in Germany two
weeks, and returned to Australia more in
love with it than ever. Finally, any person
who has met our German musicians during
the past weeks must have felt a big respect
for them. They have felt keenly the
troubles of their unhappy birth-land, and,
while never decrying it, have proved their
loyalty to Britain in the best of ways—by
providing money and good, stalwart sons.
It is not out of place to remind present de-
tractors of the German music-maker that
Melbourne music was built up largely by
Germans, amongst whom (all now dead)
were Carl Ellasser, Julius Hertz, Julius
Siede, Otto Linden, Julius Buddee and Al-
berto Zelman—the last a German-Italian.
From Jo Smith: Re the action of Mr.
J. A. Miller in prohibiting the performance
of Carton’s comedy, “Liberty Hall,” which
I had prepared for production at St. Kilda
on 17th ult., in aid of the Patriotic Fund,
Mr. Miller did, several days after the issue
of his embargo, telegraph permission to
play the piece on my sending him the fee
of five guineas; but meantime fresh print-
ing had been got out and a change of bill
announced, so I could not take advantage
of his belated offer. In a strictly legal
sense I no doubt did wrong in putting the
piece into rehearsal without first obtaining
the permission of the local agent; but as
the printed book gave no information as to
who occupied that position, I relied on being
permitted to pay the fee as soon as the per-
son in authority should disclose himself.
When this did happen I instantly tendered
the fee, but was met with a curt refusal.
Somebody once wrote in relation to a long-
ago crisis in our history —
In battle day, the King replied:
“Mice tourney rules are set aside” ;
and I believe that, even in these days of
commercialism, the brilliant author of the
quaint old comedy would have readily
granted me permission to play the piece, even
without a fee. The entertainment eventuated,
despite opposition, and realised £9O gross.
There were no expenses, so the result was
£9O net to the fund.
Mclntyre Wicksteed, dead in London at
SG, was a member of the old Brough and
Boucicault co. all through its best days. He
was of the Adelaide family of Wicksteeds, but
was known professionally as “Mr. Mclntyre.”
A sound actor in small parts, he did his best
work in stage-management. Latterly he
had been with Frohmann in London and the
U.S.A., but had been ill for two years.
“Hamer” : The touring dramatic company
is a comparatively rare thing nowadays, and
its rarity has increased its prosperity. Years
ago, when the country was less able to afford
the pretence of amusing itself, there were
five or six companies touring where one is
on the road to-day, and the people got tired.
To-day, after a surfeit of picture show and
vaudeville, the dramatic show is welcomed
as a blessed change. Quite a lot of the men
who used to go out on precarious tours have
been absorbed by the picture business, as
proprietors, managers or lecturers, or as
picture actors; and they have struck pros-
perity out of it. Yet most of them are
aching to get back to the drama which
treated them so badly.
“0. Ockney”: Arthur Bourchier, one of
the numerous tribe of nearly-broke actor-
managers in Britain, invited and duly re-
ceived a nasty knock when he recently, in
T. P.’s Weekly, advocated the Sunday
opening of theatres. Several littery gents
were invited to reply to Bourchier, and, in-
cidentally, to fill T.P.’s columns. One of
them, Hamilton Fyfe, did not mince matters.
Said he: “If we had a drama which was
alive this suggestion would be worth dis-
cussing. But the actors, the ‘fashionable’
actors, who turn what should be art into
shop-keeping, who would rather play rubbish
and eat at the Carlton than do good work
on a chop and a glass of beer, have killed
drama. They give us in its place mechanical
rabbits.” This is decidedly rough on Bour-
chier, not to mention Bourchier’s bosom
friend Tree, whose theatre adjoins the
fashionable Carlton hotel. Bourchier’s
article, by the way, was entitled “The
Tragedy of Sunday,” and the public was
informed that it was written by Arthur
Bourchier, M.A. Fyfe plainly suggests that
these letters stand for “Murderer of Art” !
Victoria’s ex-State Premier Watt, address-
ing the Australian Women’s National
League in Melbourne the other evening, said
he felt like “a man who had gone out on a
splendid steamer, and had been rescued
from a raft, with seaweed in his beard and
salt in his eyes.” Which implies that
Willie recognises he is lucky in not having
gone under during the recent Australian
elections. But the simile is not quite cor-
rect. Fearing disaster he deserted one good
ship, of which he was captain, and sought
to take refuge in another. Sitting on his
raft, cold, damp and briny, with jelly-fish
in his boots and dead prawns in his ears,
how longingly his eyes turn to the gallant
craft he left, as it sails by, youth at the
prow, and Peacock at the helm.
Adelaide is beginning to wonder whether
Colonel Light, its founder, really was the
authority in town-planning that he has been
cracked up to be. For one thing, though
the streets from east to west are frequent
and wide, the principal one from north to
south, King William-street, was blocked by
a “square” till 30 years ago, when E. T.
Smith, in face of fierce protests, got the fine
two-chain thoroughfare continued straight
through. All the others from north to south,
except two, are mere occasional lanes ; and
in the narrowest of them trade and com-
merce, with the usual perversity, have fixed
the biggest businesses. Of the two excep-
tions, Pulteney-street has just been opened
up through two blocking “squares,” amid
the same old howls about depriving the citi-
zens of their Birthright; but Morphett-street
is still blocked. As for the east-to-west
streets, they are alternately one chain and
a chain and a half wide, and, with the afore-
said perversity, the narrowest are mostly the
busiest. Light has been dead over 70 years,
and those now living who remember him
were too young to ask him questions. But
Kingston (father of C. C. Kingston) was
his lieutenant, and there are many who
remember him. Being questioned why
Rundle-street and the rest were not planned
a bit wider, he used to say that Colonel
Light meant them only as lanes for trades-
men’s carts —back entrances to the more
spacious thoroughfares 130 yards away !

AN OLD-FASHIONED COUGH SYRUP.
HOW OUR GRANDMOTHERS USED TO
PREVENT COUGHS AND COLDS.
Not long ago a writer on the editorial staff
of one of our leading publications was look-
ing through an old book in which his grand-
mother had written out a number of recipes
for home-made remedies, etc. Among other
recipes he happened to notice one for a
cough syrup which greatly interested him,
as he had for some time been suffering
from a very annoying and persistent cough,
which nothing seemed to relieve. Under
this particular recipe his grandmother had
written a note stating that she had never
known it to fail. His own cough was so
bad that he decided to give it a trial, and,
as directed in the recipe, he first obtained
from his chemist 2oz. of Mintol. (triple ex-
tract), which he mixed with a simple syrup
prepared by dissolving ill), of granulated
sugar in f-pint of hot water. This, made
nearly a pint of congh syrup, of which he
took a teaspoonful every two or three hours,
and in two days his cough had entirely dis-
appeared. He was so delighted that he per-
suaded his editor to publish the recipe. in
his next issue. Other papers when coyping

“0.K.”: The most reasonable argument
that can be advanced by those who see Gei-
man spies in every social circle is that
Germans are, broadly speaking, the most
patriotic people in the. world, and are more
numerously educated in English than. an r
other people of the European Conti-
nent. Hence the reasonable supposi-
tion that the German Government,
always dreaming of war, preparing
for war. and systematically storing cards ot
information in readiness for war, is assisted
in every foreign country by a strong force
of educated spies—patriotic amateurs,
salaried professionals, and agents working
on occasional commission and keenly on the
alert for opportunity to earn it. Just now
the breath of suspicion in Australia is blow-
ing upon German governesses, especially the
frauleins who teach Deutsch in expensive
schools for young ladies. One of these in
one of the States (not S.A.) lias mysteri-
ouslv vanished from her job since the war
started, and is said to have been arrested
on tile strength of her German correspond-
ence. In which case, the question again
arises: “Why suppress the details of a justi-
fiable arrest?” The story of an arrest that
proves to be unjustifiable, or merely a wise
precaution, should remain a secret between
the victim and the victimises; but a proven
charge of espionage, which is treason in
the case of a naturalised subject, should
surely be a matter for public information.
Away in poor, heroic little Belgium sus-
picion breeds no silence. The Germans
issue loud rifle reports in many cases, and
whatever they do is intended to discourage
the others. Can our secrecy have the same
effect on the Germans?

A story of incredible simplicity was un-
folded at the Hamilton (M.L.) Court the
other day when a lady proceeded against
the responsible party for the support of the
infant. She had been engaged to be married
to another man when the Villain came along.
The first thing he did was to write her out
a cheque for £250 to help along the wedding.
He told her not to cash the cheque.. Later
on he got possession of it by promising to
write lier one for £5OO. Then he made her
a present of a locked dressing-case, which
lie told her contained a sealskin coat and
£lOOO in notes. She was to keep the case
and not open it until instructed by him.
The fortress of Virtue had stood, the siege
well until then, but thereabouts it tumbled
to pieces. Eventually the Villain . left
hurriedly, saying he would be back in a
week, but he forgot to say which week.
So the girl and her mother, after waiting a
month, got a key and opened the dressing-
case. It contained some newspapers, three
empty beer bottles and an old pair of pants.

“Drawbolt” : The submarine burst on an
astonished world during the U.S. War of
Independence. No fewer than three unsuc-
cessful attempts were made upon English
war vessels by submarines during that un-
tidy annoyance. In each case the diving
boat came in contact with the bottom of
the hostile ship, but all efforts to sink them
failed on account of the difficulty experi-
enced in attaching the explosive _to the cop-
per-sheathed hulls. The Americans didn’t
give the problem up. During the war over
the rights of neutrals, H.M.S. Ramilies (on
July 13, 1812) was off New London, block-
ading that town, in command of Captain
Hardy (of Nelson fame). The deck sentry
observed an object rise to the • surface anu
sink again. He gave an alarm, and so
scared was the master at the man’s report
that the cables were immediately cut and
the vessel got under way. Once more the
mysterious object rose to the_ surface, _ but,
before the guns could be trained on it, it
dived again and fastened itself to the keel
of the Ramilies. Hardy got the fright of
his life, and would have been more scared
still had he known the truth. His vessel
was only saved from being blown up because
the operator lost the explosive he was en-
deavoring to attach below the water-line.
Inventive Yanks like Bushell and Fulton
were particularly keen on submarine experi-
mental work. Fulton, in 1801, built a.n
under-water craft for Napoleon. There is
something for inventors to take notice of in
connection with this matter. Anyone who
can discover a means of doing away with
the periscope—that is, anyone who can pro-
vide a means of seeing at a distance through
water —will make all floating warships so
many useless hulks. Such a device would
make a single submarine master of a fleet
of Dreadnoughts.
* . * * *
“Tawa’s” point of law: —
Under the Fugitive Offenders Act, the terms of
vhich are practically the same in Maoriland and
Australia, warrants may he issued for the extradition
of men against whom prima facie evidence exists of
wife desertion. A case before the Sydney courts
suggests that a woman may secure a warrant without
definite evidence of any kind if ' she selects a
sufficiently casual Beak. In 1902 a man married a
maid at Bath, England. Within a couple of years
they separated voluntarily, he going to Maoriland,
she staying behind. The man lived in M.L. until last
year, keeping up correspondence with his wife, who
sent him two sums of money—£loo and £4O. Then
he sailed for Sydney. After his departure the woman
reached Auckland, and forthwith obtained the execu-
tion of an extradition warrant on the ground of
desertion. Obviously he had not deserted her in
M.L., if at all; but when brought before an S.M. at
Sydney a plea to that effect had no weight. The
S.M. granted an order for extradition. The man at
once moved the Full Court on habeas corpus to stop
the order. At the first hearing Cullen, C.J., would
have discharged the application for restraint. But
brothers Pring and Sly pricked up their ears and
insisted upon the Court being satisfied that the
woman was deserted in M.L.- —that she was there
when the husband was —and held up proceedings for
further details. These on arrival did not answer the
Court’s question. Consequently, a rule was made
prohibiting extradition. This judgment will probably
have the effect of making magistrates and police
more careful in future when a woman, who has been
living in England 10 years without her husband,
wanders along and asks to have him hauled over the
sea for deserting her in a place where he never could
have deserted her because he was never there with her.
PATIENCE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Take things as they come.
If, noting the chances
Of German advances,
The cable is dumb,
Don't nibble your thumb.
The Allies are tough,
And a mighty rebuff,
When soldiers are weary and roadways arc rough,
Is not a defeat
Or strategic retreat,
But merely a check to our Jingo conceit.
Don’t fidget or worry,
The war will not hurry:
It gees along slowly, the same as John Murray.
Dream not of disasters (we’re bound to get some).
Take things as they come.
Take things as they come.
There’s a long way to go,
And the land of the foe
Will be dotted with snow,
And the sky will be glum,
And their fingers be numb
When the Russians get in
To the town of Berlin —-
For they will.
They will get there at last
Ere the winter be past,
And the Tommies shall dine
At Cologne, on the Rhine,
When the Germans have fled like the Scriptural swine,
Possessed of five devils (or seven, or nine).
And the fife and the drum
Shall play British tunes, and the Frenchmen again
Shall hang up their hats in Alsace and Lorraine,
And Poverty, fighting for life in his slum,
Shall learn from his neighbors, or else the police,
That he’s blessed, as of yore, with “the blessing of
Peace.”
These things have to happen, as surely as Fate,
But all we can do is to patiently wait,
Take things as they come.

THE HELPING HAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When rivers run a crimson course,
The times are hard for you and me,
Gun-thunder and the clash of horse
Mean more than what the eagles see ;
Wherefore, these times, the Helping Hand
Finds work in every warring land.
The loaf grows dearer day by day;
Turnips may be our meat, at last,
So, while her fighting-man’s away,
The missus must prepare to fast
At times, and eke her ha’-pence out
By shoving heirlooms up the spout.
Yet some are fat if more are lean;
Stout souls that fail to feel the pinch,
From cash-producing, canny, mean,
Self-helpful courses do not flinch.
The Helping Hand each day we see
Helping itself remorselessly.
VICTORIA.

Statements of the capture and sinking of
British merchant vessels by „the German
cruiser Emden are growing quite mon-
otonous. The successes of the Emden are
all a matter of secret service. The cruiser
always knows where to find a British mer-
chantman in the Indian Ocean, whereas the
British Admiralty never knows where to
catch the Emden. Or what it does know
is always known to the Emden before the
information has proved useful. Britain has
a terrible lot to learn about the manage-
ment and the possibilities of telegraphy,
wireless and otherwise.

For a couple of months Australia has been
chasing grass with more energy than even
Nebuchadnezzar put into the job. Though
the papers have been telling the country
that it’s in a fine position and the war really
doesn’t matter, as a fact there is a more
general, and in parts a fiercer, drought on
the premises than has ever looked in since
the early ’9o’s. It spreads from Westralia,
where the wheat harvest is a complete fail-
ure, right across to the highlands which
overhang the eastern coast-line. South Aus.
is absolutely parched in most places. The
utter wretchedness of the country north of
Adelaide may be half-guessed from the fact,
or joke, that stock have been sent up by
rail through Broken Hill into the West
Darling—and the West Darling hasn’t had
Gin. of rain in 12 months past! Victoria’s
patches of feed are so small and few that
the Ma State is now trucking fat stock to
the Melbourne markets. In N. S. Wales
the man with a paddock of grass has lived
in constant danger of being dragged out of
his bed and ordered to name a price.
Country that might carry a couple of sheep

per acre for six months—7s. for keeping one
mutton alive for half a year, with another
4s. or so for trucking, etc. ; and only the God
of War and Weather knows what the beast
may be worth six months hence. Actually
in some districts land as bare of grass as
George-street has been let at 18s. the acre on
the off-chance of early rain—and as a matter
of fact rain did fall in that part. Some
N. S. Wales sheep men, tired of butting
against famine prices in their own State,
have trucked their wool-racks north into
Queensland. But it isn’t so easy to truck
stock as to talk about it, as a man out
Wyalong way discovered. He looked in
some time early in September, and found
that his turn for trucks would come some
remote time in October.

The foreign-trading lunacy has been getting
a fine advertisement at Tonga, the little group
?< «»«. «»« have got into the „aMt
importing everything they need, from civil
servants to hair oil. When war dropped
suddenly from the . skies in August, the
Union Co., not wishing to get its boats cap-
tured by German cruisers (Tonga had quite
neglected to import a navy to protect its
one, lone trade route), suddenly cut the
Importing Kingdom out. So Tonga’s supply
of food began to pile up on the wharf at
Auckland (M.L.). Which wasn’t _ much
good to the starving Islanders out in the
Pacific, who didn’t know they were off the
map; for, of course, having no means of
communicating with the outside world, they
didn’t know that the biggest scrap in his-
tory was on and that the importing system
was stone dead. After wearing out their
eyes scanning the horizon for the boat that
didn’t arrive, the Islanders sent a schooner
down to Auckland with a yell for help and
to inquire “Whaffor?” So Masseyland,
when it was very busy and much worried,
had to rush a steamer full of tucker up to
keep alive the shiftless kingdom that com-
nienced to starve as soon as an enemy stood
guard at the front gate.

“Moana”: White Island, which blew up
suddenly the other day and buried 10 sul-
phur gatherers, is a queer spot. It is really
the summit of a submerged volcano situ-
ated in the Bay of Plenty, about 25
miles from the Maori mainland, on the direct
line of the famous thermal fault that runs
from Ngaruahoe, the active volcano in the
centre of the North Island, through Taupo,
Wairakei and Rotorua, away out into the
Pacific. The island is about 1000 acres in
extent, and rears itself up nearly 1000 ft.
There is a big crater in the centre that sends
up a column of white steam to a height of
well over 6000 ft. It is from this cloud that
the place takes its name, and for hundreds
of years the Maoris in the Bay of Plenty
have been in the habit of watching the curl
of it, and so forecasting the weather. The
island is mostly sulphur, and there is a small
lake of hydrochloric acid of high tempera-
ture that makes the place smell like a plum-
ber’s shop. Life on the speck is one long
earthquake, interspersed with eruptions and
clouds of dust and volcanic ash. Many years
ago a start was made to work the sulphur
deposits near the shore, but after a time
the firm that had the rights fled hurriedly,
presumably because its nerve had departed,
and the place was left to the seabirds. Then
a syndicate from U.S.A. came along and
started on the sulphur with good results.
It looked as if a big industry would be built
up. but the sudden collapse of the whole
outfit puts a different appearance on matters.
The island is quite barren of vegetation,
and all stores for the men working there had
to be taken from the mainland. In spite of
its weirdness the men said they liked the
place, and the spot where their huts were
built was considered perfectly safe. But,
then, Europe was considered perfectly safe
a week or two hack.
“Michael O’Hell”:
Death to the at-
tempted descriptive
war-writer! I'm sick
of him and his coun-
terfeit coin. When-
ever the drivelling
ass writes of a gun,
he solemnly labels it
“death-dealing” as
though there were
guns that shampooed
the enemy’s hair and
pushed plates of Irish
stew at him, and
quickfirers that did
hi s wife’s washing
and bathed the baby.
Every gun that isn’t
a death-dealer is a
fraud. When the un-
fortunate Belgians
found, after being in
action, that some of
their imported Krupp
fortress guns weren’t
accurate or up-to-
da t e death-dealers,
they were not sur-
prised—they were
mad as hornets. The
worst gibe yet aimed
at the otherwise effi-
cient German artil-
lery was that a burst-
ing shell cured the
raging neuralgia of an
English soldier called
Palmer. In that par-
ticular instance, the
elaborate slaughter
machine practically
gave him a dose of
expensive soothing
syrup, and thereby
made war ridiculous.
The next fool who
writes of “death-deal-
ing” guns can rely on
getting an insulting letter from me.*
“Adelaide”: What nonsense this talk is
about altering “German” names of Aus-
tralian towns! South Aus. has Lobethal
and Grunthal, Hahndorf and Klemzig, and
a dozen more, mostly names given 70 years
ago by good immigrants whose descendants
are now good Australians. The folly of the
idea is carried on to the extreme of suggest-
ing that “Tanunda” should be wiped out.
As a matter of fact, Tanunda is a native
name, like Kapunda and Eudunda, its neigh-
bors on the map. If anything ought to be
changed it is Sedan, a name given by Ger-
man settlers to commemorate something the
French are now trying hard to avenge. The
whole thing is paltry a.nd short-sighted. Less
than 20 years ago it seemed that Britain
could not avoid war with France. A little
before it was Russia ; a little before that, the
U.S.A. What good friends our enemies
make —as Botha will bear witness ! What
are the odds that we shall not have our
armies linked in friendly alliance with the
German Republic inside 20 years?

A Sydney woman who petitioned Justice
Gordon the other day for a decree nisi told
a story which made his Hopor get up full
steam in his thinking engines, She said she’d
been married 17 years, but her husband had
for 13 of these years treated her as a com-
plete stranger. He never spoke to her, would
not sit down to a meal in her company, and
if he met her in the street he passed her by
without recognition. She declared she could
endure this no longer, and asked th§ Court
to hold that the husband’s frigid remoteness
constituted legal desertion. Gordop’§ diffi-
culty was that the respondent had Tiyed all
the time in the house, and provided hjs yvife
with food, raiment and shelter, ft’s an odd
sort of business altogether, and the Fpll
Court will have to split hairs in order tq
make actual “desertion” out of mere silepcp,
If it succeeds, then, obviously, the good old
order for “restitution of conjugal rights”
becomes a jest. There was a case in Maori-
land very like this one. The man and wife
voluntarily agreed never to speak to each
other again—the reason doesn’t matter. And
they didn’t, though they lived nominally
together for 19 years after the compact. She
ordered the household and ministered in a
detached way to his comfort. The sons grew
to manhood in a home in which there was
complete severance between father and
mother. The principals played their part, or
foolery or whatever it was, with perfect dis-
cretion, and only a few people knew
why a very reserved public officer
spent such a great part of his life in his
office and his holidays on lonely fishing
streams.

“Billy Blue”: The regulation of the price
of flour in Sydney, by a commission appointed by
the 'Government, is, after all, only history pursuing
its tail. Away back on May 17, 1801, Governor
King ordered the Deputy-Commissary and the
Quartermaster of the N.S.W. Corps to inquire into
the amount of bread that could be made from 141 b.
of wheat. The wheat was to be ground at the mill
of one Palmer, and the flour to be kneaded in front
of the Commissioners, baked and weighed. '1 his
was done and result reported to the Governor, who
thereupon issued a proclamation, dated May 16, 1801,
that lie and the magistrates had decided that,
until things improved, not more than 31b.
of wheat could lie demanded for a 21b. loaf.
There was no currency at that moth-eaten date, and
most things were bought and sold by barter. The
wheat was generally purchased by exchange for rum.
Again, in Macquarie’s time, the Governor did the
same, and appointed the bench of magistrates in
Sydney to regulate .the ingredients, weight and price
of bread. On June 2, 1810, a proclamation was
issued to enable the poorer orders of the com-
munity to obtain wholesome bread at reasonable
price, as follows:
(1) That, until further orders, no other than one
quality of wheaten bread shall be made throughout
the colony.
(2) That such bread shall be made of meal from
which only 121 b. of bran, shall be taken from each
and everv bushel of wheat.
(8) That no bread shall be sold until the same
be 24 hours old.
(4) That each loaf of bread when 24 hours old
shall weigh 21b.
(5) That the assize of bread, until further orders,
shall be at the rate of lid. for. each loaf of the
weight of 21b.
(0) Provided punishment for breaches ot the
orders.
(7) Ordered constables to wear a bull-hound air
of ferocity in the vicinity of bakeries.
(8) Tliat, as maize now forms part of the ration,
it is highly expedient that the baker should regu-
larly bake a certain proportion of bread from that
grain, and that it is the intention of the magis-
trates to enforce such a measure as soon as possible.
The bakers tried to avoid these regulations by
baking cakes and biscuits of less weight, which led
Macquarie to issue two new regulations, not allow-
ing cakes and biscuits to be baked without his per-
mission. Every baker was required to mark every
loaf lie exposed for sale with his initials, so that he
could be promptly flogged if the ease called for such
action.

Luck ! What are the odds against your

frightened in succession by an emu and a fox ? Yet
that is what happened to a man in up-country South
Australia. The native bird did not do much harm,
but the imported beast caused a bad smash-up.
' “Ed.”: Most of my contemporaries will
remember the fire-brigade fever that struck Victoria
about the year 1874. Every town and hamlet went
dippy about firemen, and it was only a hole for
defunct cats that hadn’t at least two volunteer fire
brigades in violent competition. Piggory, near
Bungaree, was caught in the movement, and pre-
sently a splendid band of young Hibernians, once
removed, was tearing over the hills and far away
night after night, towing hose-reel and bucket-cart
and carrying all the appliances and means for ex-
tinguishing burning buildings and the utter abolition
of buildings that might reasonably,
or unreasonably, be suspected of the
intention of catching fire immediately
or in the near future. Phinny Ryan
was the promoter, captain, guide,
financier and irresistible moving spirit
of the Piggory No. 1 Volunteer Fire
Brigade. Ryan bought the hose-reel
and provided the hose (although
there was no water laid on within
21 miles of Piggory) ; he designed
the uniform; and enlisted the men;
and supervised the drill and training;
and it was he who bought the cracked
bell from a Wesleyan chapel at Bal-
larat, and hung it over his stable loft
to ring for fires, or to bring the
brigade out for full-dress rehearsals.
The brigade was in excellent order
when one night a half-drunken
potato-digger upset the lamp in Ryan’s
kitchen. Instantly there was a rush
for buckets and water. Ryan, standing
in the smoke, stopped the amateur
fire-fighters at the door. “Shtand
back, min!’’ he cried. “For whoi is
Piggory shupportin’ a shplendid fire
brigade, would yeh tell me?” And
Ryan went ealmly forth and rang the
fire-bell, and in due course the fire
brigade appeared and rescued Ryan’s
iron bed and three chairs, but. Ryan’s house was
completely destroyed.
Close observance to business on the
Sabbath brings its due reward. So Donald McViear,
who was prospecting' at Isabella (near Bathurst,
N.S.W.) on a recent Sunday, proved when he discov-
ered a 28joz. nugget of gold worth about £ll6. On
the other hand, a Clifton (Q.) resident fears it is risky
to take liberties with the alleged day of rest. He
was charged with having been “found engaged shooting
for pleasure at Leyburn-road, near Clifton,’’ on the
Sawbath, contrary to the Sunday Observance Act, 1841.
Solicitor for the defendant proved that his client was
not shooting on the road at all, but on some
unoccupied property off the road. The two J’s.P.,
who constituted the Bench, buried themselves in deep
thought, considered the point fatal, and dismissed the
information. The moral of all this is: (1) If you
will shoot on Sundays, don’t be found out; (2) If
you do shoot on Sundays and are found out, prove
that you were shooting in a place that isn’t the
place mentioned in the information; (8) Don’t shoot
on Sundays—go prospecting: (4) Don’t do your pros-
pecting on the Stock Exchange.

“A..T.R.8.”: Once saw at Bougainville
(Solomon Islands) a wedding and native dance.
According to custom a young man is in a proper
state to marry after he has worn a large hat, some-
thing like an inverted toilet jug without a handle,
until it is full of hair. On the wedding day the hat
is removed with grpat ceremony, the hair is trimmed
and combed and the face painted. The body is then
stripped and oiled, and, mounted on boys’ shoulders,
the bridegroom is carried into a ring of dancers.
There the bride cakewalks up to him attended by a
host of other women, the ’groom eats betel nut, and
the dance proceeds. Sometimes a dance lasts two or
three days, and the noise is like the Devil throwing
shovels into Eternity.

“Ananias Walton”: “Pick” and other
contributors who refer to the small fish which is
often hauled ashore adhering to a shark as a “pilot
fish” are in error. The adhesive individual is a
remora, or sucker fish. He is in the habit of fasten-
ing on to anything that will give him a free ride.
Turtles and sharks are among his favorite hosts.
The sucker, which is on top of the head, resembles
nothing so much as the corrugated sole of a sand-
shoe, and has a tenacious grip. The pilot fish proper
is a pretty little chap of the mackerel family. He
swims in company with the shark, but, unlike the
remora, is detached from him. The reasons for the
pilot’s attachment are purely business-like. He comes
in for the crumbs which fall from the rich fish’s
table. The remora just hangs on because he is too
tired to swim for himself.

Reports from Warracknabeal (Vic.)
announce the appearance of an advance guard of
emus, for the fh’st time in 12 years. The drought in
the back country has driven them.south.
“Lagani-Namo” : There are many curious
methods of fishing employed through the Pacific
Islands, but the most peculiar is that adopted by
the Murray Islanders (Torres Straits). There is a
big fish up there which uses turtles' roofs as a resi-
dence. It affixes. itself by means of a powerful valve
situated on the back of its head. The natives bore
a hole well up in this fish's gristly tail, and tie a
strong sinnet (coeoanut husk) line to it. When the
canoes go looking' for turtle they tow the sucker
fish alongside. Striking a likely lagoon in the reef
the fish scout is given plenty of slack and urged to
get busy. If there’s a shellback in range the sucker
will soon get fast on it. The turtle simply looks upon
this as a friendly call, until he observes a native swim-
ming down along the guiding line toward him. Then
his remarks shock the mermaids in the vicinity, and
be struggles like a 40-horse-power torpedo to escape,
The sucker, meanwhile, clings like a bulldog, and the
fcatamaran at the Other end of the line is dragged
hither and thither in a welter of water. Suddenly
the boy below mounts the tin tie, puts his hands
under the chin, whips home the spurs —and is buck-
jumped to the surface. After that there is a
deceased turtle.
Note from Papuan magistrate’s diary:
“At 4 p.m. Sergeant Adi strolled into camp, fol-
lowed by six native porters carrying live human
legs and the forequarters of a girl, all neatly boned
and twisted around carrying poles. Adi reported
that he found the carcases at a village en route, and
the people there told him that bush boys had raided
them at daybreak this morning and killed 11 of
them. The arrival of reinforcements prevented the
bush boys getting away with all the meat.”
Half an hour later: “Since making the above entry,
I have ordered the burial of the remains. I found

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A proclamation has been issued prohibiting abso-
lutely the importation into Australia of raw opium
and prepared opium as defined, a nil the importation,
except under license by the Collector of Customs, of
medicinal preparations containing more ; than the
specified-by-regulation percentage of opium amongst
their ingredients.
Me have robbed the silent Chirjkie of his heaven
of delight :
We have swept away his sputt’ring, pungent pill;
Me have changed, from out. our wisdom, earth’s glad
sunshine into night,
And we have made a void that nought can fill.
M’e have blotted out the rainbow and the colors of
the morn ;
Mo have, blotted out the sun and all the stars;
M e have left our yellow brother’ in his -dingy den
forlorn—-
A prisoner behind our Virtue’s bars.
Me have hushed the sound of music and the peal of
silver bells,
And on the face of Beauty placed a mask;;
M’e have killed the glowing happiness that smokes but
never tells—
And all for what?—yes, all for what? I ask!
We have made the bright birds" songiess ; and the
colors on their wing
No longer flash and sparkle in the sun;
.We have left the snake his venom, and the wicked
asp its sting-
And so the will of Rectitude is done!
We have killed the flowers that blossom; we have
ta’en their scents away ;
The green of earth, is gone; the splendid sky
Has lost its blues and purples; they have faded into
grey-
To one and all the Chink must say good-bye.
And his den becomes a prison ; and the fairies that
were there
Have flitted out, and ogres fill (he room—-
Dread ogres, in their fingers all' the Hell-loops of
Despair,
And on their viper tongues the words of Doom.
But we, the soiled-soul savers, we will preen our
paltry pride,
And notch another triumph to our creed —
The. creed that by such glories, has been ultra-
sanctified —■
All potent in our erring brother’s need.
And yet, for all our Virtue and our hatred of the
Vice <•
That grips the soul within its spq.lt’ring flame,
I make me bold to venture, while’his pockets hold the
price,
The Chow will get his opium just the same!

“Tiaki”: In the Whara Whara hush,
about 200 miles north of Auckland (M.L.), there are
immense trees growing, some of which are estimated
to be over 1000 years of age. Under the roots of this
forest is the timber of another dead-and-gone planta-
tion, which must have been in its .prime ere Cain
and Abel had their little difference. Some of the
trunks—minus their sap—are 10ft. and 12ft. in
diameter. AVhat killed them, or how long they
lay there, until the humus and drifted pumice
formed a soil strong enough to start a spring crop
of second growth is not on the record. Also, how
many crops of second growth (manuka and small
trees) blossomed and died ere king Kauri again came
into his own, He only knoweth, and He is. not com-
municative on the subject.
MISSED.
STOUT STRANGER (by way of starting conversation): “It's this 'ere - low Labor
legislation that's mining the country, don't you think ?”
2ND STRANGER : “ Well — er—not altogether. You see, I happen to be the Labor member

“rick” : Some blokes display tardy
judgment when determining the exact point in a dis-
turbance where real stoush should commence. Shear-
ing was half through at Digmeout when George Moore
applied for a pen. He got a wink from the overseer
to hang around until one or another of the toma-
hawlcers did something that would admit of the spear.
It came next day, and Morgan, the hut comedian,
was sacked. That evening as regularly as Moore
entered the hut someone fired him out again. In
between times he was bootlaced, ducked in the dip,
keelhauled through the muck of the yards, and bashed
by the whole fraternity from ringer to dagpicker.
Finally preparations were begun to tar his blankets,
and then Moore flared up. In three whirlwinds he
outed the shed bully, a presser and the slushy, and
chased Morgan over the horizon. When he came
back he informed the company that if it didn’t leave
him alone there would certainly be a fight.
“J.J.C.”: I see by a quotation in a
Bulletin advt. (3/9/'l4) that the London Globe,
in reviewing Baldwin Spencer’s book on the native
tribes of the Northern Territory, states “that he
carried out his investigations on Melville Island at
a great personal risk.” The only risk anyone takes in
Melville Island is the risk of being short of whisky
or tobacco. The natives there have long been in
contact with Europeans, and are as highly civilised
as a Binghi tribe ever becomes. They greet
the pilgrim and the stranger with loud shouts of joy
and cries of “You givit tobacco, boss, plenty fellah.”

“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: Saw somewhere
the other day that some enthusiastic missionary
gentleman had remarked that cannibalism, if it
ever did exist amongst the Australian blacks —which
he doubted- —had absolutely not been known for
60 years. In 1881 I was an eye-witness to the
artistic bashing of an infant aboriginal against a
gum-tree. Said infant was a peevish, cross child who
kept the camp awake half the night, and," this being
a crime of the blackest, she was knocked on the
head and literally thrown to, not the dogs, but to
the old women, who cooked and ate the. hands and
feet. At least we found evidence to that effect in
the ashes next morning. The rest of the body was
juried. It was well known on the Fraser that
the old women ate the hands and feet of infants
that died, though the young gins were not allowed
to do so. My opinion is that all the aborigines
were cannibals when occasion offered and animal
food was scarce. Blacks, who came from the Far
North in the timber and oyster boats, used to amuse
the camps nightly with exhibitions of the antics and
agonies of the unfortunate Chinese roasting
on the i'ed-hot ashes. It was known that old
Christy Palmerston received a regular toll from the
Chinese packers and miners to guard them from the
blacks. However, in spite of all his vigilance,
baked Chinaman with trimmings was a favorite dish
with our colored Binghi brother on the Walsh, the
llodgkinson (Q.) and specially the Palmer, when
the fields up there were booming. After all, what’s
the difference so long- ns you’re happy ? These dis-
tinctions arc mostly sentiment. I once served
curried iguana to a whole bench of Justice, to their
acknowledged satisfaction. In one little moment of
vainglory I betrayed the secret. It would be best
to draw a veil over the barefaced ingratitude that
Justice displayed and expressed.

“T.D.D.”: The De Beers (South Africa)
diamond mines have generally about 8000 natives in
their compounds. These coons work for eight to 10
months at a stretch, and then decide that they should
see to their wives, dogs, piccaninnies and other rubbish.
A native, is not, however, allowed to depart at a
moment's notice. There is a formality to be gone
through. A small compound is set aside where the
blackskin is kept for a week. I spare you the details.
The recovery of diamonds from this compound is con-
siderable. At the mine head-office a photo, is shown
of 21 stones, valued at £1067 4s. 6d., which repre-
sent a 100 per cent, recovery from one single boy.
At least, it is supposed that the recovery was 100 per
cent. The nigger may really have gone away with
£3201 13s. 6d. inside him.
TONGA’S NEUTRALITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Psyche called at Varan, and conveyed first
news of the war to the islanders. The King of Tonga
gave assurance of his neutrality.
The eagles scream, the lions roar,
The dragon waves his dreadful tail,
The shrapnel shrieks along the shore,
And death is riding on the gale.
(However fierce the strife may be
Tonga will keep neutrality.)
We have an eye upon the Turk ;
How Italy may choose to act
Gives our imagination work,
But little need we care, in fact,
Contented in our beds to know
That Tonga will not help the foe.
The Kaiser, learning it is vain
To hope for Tonga’s backing, must
Express his feelings in a strain
Of rabid anger and disgust.
Sweet peace has flown ten thousand miles
Her home is in The Friendly Isles!

SILAS SNELL.
Two Headstrong Men of
Milligan’s Hill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'YICT'OULD you meet anywhere a inoye
yi obstreperous man than Dennis Cal-
laghan, or a wilder, or a more
headstrong and perverse? You would never.
And he the tall, fine fellow, with the keen,
dark eye under a swipe of black brows as
level as a rail —the handsomest lad of Milli-
gan’s Hill.
But there was one man in Bungaree close
up as obstreperous and self-willed as Dennis
Callaghan, and that was Tommy O’Moore;
and Tommy O’Moore, by the grace of God,
was own father to little Helen O’Moore,
which was Dennis’s girl a whole year, slip-
ping behind boulders, and creeping in the
saplings of the creek, and in the scrub over
under the Hill, before the good man himself
heard a word of it.
Then Tommy O’Moore’s suspicions were
greatly stirred by rumors and simple hints, so
he took concern to himself, and sat himself
to bestow great attention on the affairs and
the geneial perambulations and simple tricks
of the same Dennis Callaghan, Dennis being
a man with a name to him for' light conduct
and conceit with women, lie being loose in
his diversions and roving by nature.
’Tis a Tuesday there was a note for
Dennis Callaghan at his own home, asking
him, polite and persuasive with compliments,
would he be doing Mr. Thomas O’Moore the
honor and the great kindness of dropping in
at the humble but honorable abode of the
O’Moores for some trifle of small talk con-
cerning a morsel of land by the creek side,
also a poor small cow O’Moore was wishing
to sell.
Dennis put on some of his best wearing,
and knocked at O’Moore’s front door, and
himself onetied to him with a line bow, the
O’Moores being gracious and courtly stock
connect with certain kings of Connaught in
the days before Cromwell and the seven
plagues of the North.
“’N’ how are yeh, Misther Callaghan?"
says he. “ ’N’ will yeh not step in me poor
house?” he says. Nothing could be finer than
the way it was done. You'd think ’twas a
palace no less. And it a four-roomed
weatherboard, with one window like a blind
eye and • a little pink pig at home in the
kitchen.
“Thank you kindly, O’Moore,” says Dennis,
equally polite and deferential, taking off his
hat with a fine bend of the head, but keeping
an eye on Tommy nevertheless. “I will sit
me down if yer so kind, the day bein’ a
thrifle warrm ’n’ oppressive.”
With that O’Moore showed him to the
front room, which is by way of being the
living room, and the eating room, and the
sitting room, and the room where young Tim
sleeps all weathers. But for the style of
O’Moore ’tis the finest rare apartment of a
king’s castle.
Dennis Callaghan stood, his hat in his
hand, a model of decorum ’n’ good conduct.
” ’N’ will yeh not do me the honor t’ be
seated?” sez O’Moore. “’Tis a poor chair
I’m able t’ offer, but such ez it is you’re
welcome, man.”
"I thank yeh from me hearrt,” sez Dennis,
and down he sits, still with a big. inquisitive
and inquiring eye on O’Moore.
“Fine weather we’re havin’,” says Tommy
O’Moore.
“Beautiful weather no less, wid the fine
rain failin’, ’n’ the crops drinkin’ their fill,
sor,” says Dennis Callaghan.
"You’ll be havin’ twilve bushels the acre
from that c-hoc’late site ’yant th’ crick.”
says O’Moore.
"The Lord lovin’ me ’n’ all goin’ well,”
Dennis admits. “N’ a fine disarnin’ n’ care-
ful one wid cows, yeh are, Callaghan. Yiv
a grreat herd —niver a better.”
“’Tis gracious iv yeh, O’Moore, t’ be
sayin’ ut, ’n’ no finer ’r more judicious a
judge Bungaree about than yersilf, ez
ann.vwan knows.”
’Twas the like of this they talked a half-
hour, maybe, when Dennis took his hat
again, and said he: “Well, I’ll be goin’,
O’Moore. ’Tis great bizness I have with
Hanrahan consumin' cattle.”
“Yill sit a while. Dennis,” says O’Moore.
“I will not, O’Moore, sorry as I am t’ be
lavin’ yer hoshpitality ’n’ yer insthructive
talk, but me bizness is pressin’. So a
good day t’ yeh, ’n’ me compliments to her-
silf whin she comes.”
"Yill sit a while, Dennis, dear,” says
O’Moore, in a small, nice voice, at the same
time producing a great revolving pistol from
his coat and laying it on his knee.
"Beggin’ yer parrdon, Misther Thomas
O’Moore, iv the ryle houses iv Connaught,
’n’ wid yer good lave I’ll be goin,” says
Dennis, and he draws a similar, long revolv-
ing pistol from his vest, and holds it on his
knee.
“I’m thinkin’, Callaghan, 'twill be a cold
day fer wan if us this night if ye go to lave
me house,” says O’Moore.
"As the blessed saints will have it, then,
O’Moore,” replies Dennis, with piety and
decorum. “Good aftliernoon t’ yeh.”
"Sit yeh down,” says O’Moore, presenting
his revolving pistol. “ ’Twould consarn me
much t’ blow yer brains agin the clane wall,
but here T have yeh, ’n’ here yeh stay
pendin’ the coming if herself wid the praste .
’n’ me little girrl, Helen.”
Dennis holds liis pistol, his finger on the
trigger, and it lifting with a grave insinua-
tion that’s not lost on O’Moore at all. “N’
why is it, O’Moore, yill have me stay by
yeh?” says Callaghan. “Will yeh account t’
me now fer this sudden affection fer me per-
son’n’great, overweenin’ desire fer me good
company? Am 1 owin’ yeh annythin’? Is
there a fine clvrist’nin’ coinin’ off yill have
me wait the praste?”
“No christenin’, man —never annythin’ iv
anny import shmall ’r grreat is coinin’ off
but a weddin’.”
“Indade then! ’N’whose is it, may I
axe ?”'
“ ’Tis yer own, Dennis Callaghan,” and
Tommy points his revolvin’ pistol more de-
termined.
“Yer a liar, Tommy O’Moore, -out tis
waste iv me worrds, iv’ry wan lcnowin’ yeh
for a liar,” and Dennis’s revolving pistol is
pointed square in Tommy’s right eye. _ >
"Yer own marryin', Dennis Callaghan, n
me little girrl’S,” sez O’Moore. , .
• l ’N’ will I be marryin’ fer yer say so, n
me a free man?” says Dennis. “I’ll see yeh
bubblin’ in Hell, firrst, ’n’ will divert mesilf
greatly ’n’ a long while wid the sight iv uf.
Tommy O’Moore.”
With that Dennis jumps for the door, and
O’Moore is quick with the revolvin’ pistol,
blazing at him as he goes. Shot in the
thick if the leg. Dennis breaks for the
kitchen, and. finding the door locked on him,
CROSSING THE BAR.
“If this counter was to break , ’ Fnery, were
and we be? ”
“In 'Eaven, William!”
tears the crockery cupboard from the wall,
and takes cover behind.
O’Moore comes in firing a pot shot, and
does mortal hurt to a milk jug, and Dennis,
taking aim, shoots away one-tenth of the
good man’s whisker. O’Moore utters the
tribal yell of his royal ancestors, and ducks
behind the colonial sofa. Once Dennis gets
a hole in Tommy’s ear with a neat bit of
quick fire, and once Tommy furrows the scalp
of Callaghan as he peers from his entrench-
ment.
“Show yersilf, man, ’n’ I'll shoot the head
clane from yer shoulder,” said O’Moore,
“’r shtay where yeh are ’n’ be married to me
little girrl like a Christian ’n’ a scholar.”
“I’ll do nothin’ fer the biddin’ iv anny livin’
man, ’r dog, ’r devil.” said Callaghan, and
shot through a small portion of Tommy’s
shoulder. “Ah-h, yeh got ut, did yer? Yeh
thought to enthrap me, O’Moore, hut wasn’t
I suspicious iv yeh, ’n’ you the cunnin
plotter all yer days? Would a man come to
yeh onprepared, ’n’ him bearin’ the grreat
talk yiv made, ’n’ the big worrds yiv uttered
iv what yid do ’n’ what yeh would niver do?
Let yeh know, O’Moore, Dennis Callaghan
will take the bould orrder ’n’ biddin’ from
none iv yeh, dead T alive.”
“Yill marry wid me Helen whin herself
returns wid Father Dunn ’n' the girrl, ’r yill
not lave alive,” said O’Moore.
,“’Tis vain ’n’ foolish, so 'tis, t’ pretind t’
disave yersilf, O’Moore. Will yeh know in
yer liearrt I’m not t’ be druv to ut wid all
the prastes iv eternity ’n’ all the pistols iv
creation,”
This drove O’Moore clean from his wits,
and he blazed at the crockery cupboard pro-
miscuously, and Dennis blazed back. Then
seizing his chance O’Moore let fly his empty
pistol, and knocked Callaghan’s head in a
bit. Dennis retorted with a great jug, V ■
crashed it above the left ear of Tommy
O’Moore. Dennis threw plates, and Tommy
responded liberally with split wood from the
fireplace. Then Dennis, with a splendid
meat dish, and Tommy with the big bellows
clutched by the nozzle, rushed one another,
smashed in a final blow a-piece, most im-
partial, and fell apart on their backs, ex-
hausted with wounds and bruises.
So Father Dunn found them, coming in
with Mrs. O’Moore and the girl Helen,
lying in their blood, near dead seemingly,
but still game and contrary.
“Is it for this yiv brought me, Mrs.
O’Moore, ma’am?” cried the priest.
“’Twas not,” replied O’Moore, raising him-
self a bit from the floor. “’Twas t’ marry
me girrl Helen t’ this bla’guarrd ’n’ villain,
’n’ him aft her philanderin’ ’n’ lovin’ wid her
a year gone, ’n’ me sad wid misgivin’s.”
“T’ marry them?” said Father Dunn.
“T’ marry us?” wailed Helen, down be
Dennis ’n’ nursing his hurt head.
“Yes. ’n’ will yeh be quick while there’s
life in him?”
“Lord forgive yeh for a hot-hidded. blun-
tlierin’ sinner,” said his reverence. “Didn’t
I marry the two of them at Flynn’s three
weeks come' Monday?”

freight department of the A.U.S.N. Com-
pany. “Tom.” who is about the youngest
man for his 08 years that writer ever looked
upon—lie is a tennis-player of no mean
calibre, and tennis is not a sit-down game,
like marbles or euchre —was born in Kent-
street in the days when Sydney was largely
barracks, flogging and scenery, liis father,
the Rev. Nathaniel Pidgeon, was the first
man who ever systematically set out to con-
vince the Ma capital that this is a wicked
world, and lie had good reasons for so
doing. Among the sights he had seen in the
30’s of last century, the off (or up) swing-
ing of six men in one batch at Wynyard-
square figured prominently. But Tom,
though the son of a missionary, was no
wowser. Incidentally, he joined the old
A.S.N. Co. before the first unpaid N.S.W.
loan.
CHARLIE ROCHER, of Launceston (Tas.).
Dr Manning who has joined the heavenly
host at the age of 75, came to Sydney in
1804 as one of five Methodist ministers
sent out from London to be shepherds of
the Wesleyan brand of souls in Aus-
tralia. Manning, however, broke away
and joined the Church of England in
1870. Probably the inward struggles
told on him; anyway he is the first
of a tough five to have a funeral.
Brentnall, another of them, gave up the
gospel and took to journalism, and is now a
newspaper proprietor and M.L.C. in Bris-
bane. Dr. Sellors (79), Rev. E. Bourne
(82), and Rev. Charles Stead (70-odd) were
the others.
Henry Gullett, who only ceased to be a
hard-working journalist eight or 10 years
ago, leaves his four daughters a very tidy
£125,000. The fine old pressman, who did
hard toil with his hands in Ills early days,
built his fortune on the success of Sydney
Telegraph ; and that’s mostly a matter of
the past 15 years. Gullett had a comfort-
able salaried job on the Australasian
when the struggling ’Graph enticed him
across with the offer of shares. Started in
1884, the co. in 1894 was still pay-
ing only 10 per cent, on a modest
£50.000 of capital. Since then every
share lias been turned into five, with
a fraction over, and a steady 121 per
cent, is paid, so that Henry Gullett was
lately drawing close on to 70 per cent, a
year on the face value of the original shares
that lured him over, and on the others that
he managed to lay hold of in the early days
of struggle. Son-in-law Ileney, editor of
the S. M. Hera i.i). is one of the executors.
THE ORNAMENT AND DIGNITY OF
THE GERMAN IRON CROSS.
The fascination of “the great white
Heaven” (Heaven for one day, and Hell
for the rest of each month) lias again called
Frank Hurley, a Sydney photographer,
whose work with the Mawson expedition has
easily secured him the job of official photo-
grapher to the Shackleton enterprise. This
trip Hurley expects to obtain something
extra-special, the expedition being more
completely armed with photographic weapons
than any predecessor. Apart from the usual
kit. every member will carry a vest-pocket
camera; a micro-cinema outfit will register
the life of minute organisms ; a light cinema
will record the proposed dash across the
continent; and natural-color photography
will be tested: All these supplies, obtained"
in Australia, left a few days ago with
Hurley for Buenos Aires, where he and they
will join the expedition.
“Jeames” :
One of the papers had a heading, last week,
“Bomb-throwing: Paris Hotel Injured,” and went on
to tell how a missile had been directed by a German
airman at the Hotel de Monaco. This, of
course, is no mere pub, but the Paris home of
the Sovereign of Monte Carlo. It is a pictur-
esque white building standing behind vast iron gates,
in the Place d'lena, off the Rue Pierre Charron.
I once knew a butler who had been in service at
the Hotel de Monaco. It was his habit, when cham-
pagne was being drunk at a dinner party, to seize
the bottle, hold it flamboyantly before the guest and
shout a word which sounded like “Sharmpanyer.”
Having thus, as it were, introduced the beverage, he
poured it out in a magnificent and impressive manner.
The family tried to get him to stop this ceremony.
They had a haunting feeling that their champagne
was hardly worth it. In vain, however, lie said he
had learned this method in the Prince’s household, and
would die l w ’ f orc he abandoned it. ‘ln other respects
he was an ordinary human being. To get back to the
Prince, he married, in his innocent youth, an Eng-
lishwoman—one of the Buccleucli family. She pre-
sently divorced him ; for 30 years ago he was ex-
tremely swift over the grass. Most of his large
income arises from the gaudy gaming establishment
which lies across the bay, to his left, as he looks out
on the Mediterranean from the palace of his princi-
pality. The Blancs have made so much money out
of the Casino that one of them has been enabled to
marry into the Napoleon family, and it has kept the
Prince for quarter of a century and more in yachts,
French chateaux and high living generally. But
now he is old and tired and rather doddering, and
his sight is so bad that his favorite pastime of yacht-
ing is a weariness, and the rest of the royalties will
have nothing to do with him on account of his lurid
past and the encouragement he has given to the
gaming industry. And, to cap it all, the Germans
have begun to throw bombs into liis kitchen.
"T. 0.1.”: Falconbridge, the Mountain
home of the late Henry Parkes, is deserted
and rapidly falling to decay. About it there
are mementoes of the old toy-maker’s hand
in carvings on rocks and in niches. When
Parkes took up Mountain land Geoffrey
Edgar already had Wyoming, now Valley
Heights. “Old Jeff’s” home had been a way-
side inn ; it stands there still. Others soon
followed. Charles Moore, one-time Mayor
of Sydney, was at Springwood; Alfred
Stephen, Chief Justice, was at Alpliington;
James Martin. Chief Justice, was at
Numautia, where he put down immense
foundations, intending to build a mansion of
unequalled sumptuousness. The backyard
to it included what is now Hazelbrook.
Job Sheldon, one of the members of the
first Labor party in the N.S.W. Assembly,
died in Sydney the other day. Job scraped
in for the Namoi on the votes of the shearers
and carriers in 3891, but soon got into
trouble with Joe Cook and the majority by
insisting that Protection was the obvious
fiscal policy for any party that wanted to
get w< >rk for Australian workers and save
them from the competition of foreign
sweaters. Owing to these disruptions the
party fell away in 1894, and Job wasn't
saved even with the skin of his teeth. But
lie did his little bit for the party for years
afterwards, and then, in his old age, the
party did its little bit for him by giving him
the job of Deputy Assistant Duster of the
Constitution in the Assembly, or something
of the sort.
“Chasuble”: Father Robinson, of Camber-
well (Vic.), is lost as a cleric. Ib l oughl
to have been an insurance canvasser or a
company promoter. He would then have
become a Monarch of Finance. Some time
ago he decided to build a magnificent church
named Our Lady of Victories, on Camber-
well Hill. lie called on his co-religionists
for 50,000 stones at 10 shillings apiece.
Archbishop Carr paid for the first 100
stones, and the Pone promised to find the
last £5O worth. After that the building
went ahead like mad. The daring promoter
next called for the community’s unwanted
jewellery to be melted into sacred vessels of
the altar. It came along! Then quoth
Robinson: “Somebody must give me £OOO
for the big painted window, already de-
signed. to represent the great naval battle
of Lepanto. Christians against Turks, won
by Pope’s prayer to Our Lady of Vic-
tories.” And now an anonymous donor has
come forward with the cash. Great is the
power of Faith, but even greater the might
of Robinson.
VIOLENT.
“I don't know how you had the hide to ask
him for Alice. He's such a violent old
devil."
“By cripcs, he is. He nearly shook my arm
off."
Died at Stanhope Gardens, London, on
September 30, Lucy, widow of Septimus
Alfred Stephen, M.L.C. She was a daughter
of Robert ampbell. “of the Wharf,” who
was N.S.W. Colonial Treasurer, and died
in harness in 1859. Another daughter mar-
ried Colonel Ward, first master of the Sydney
Mint. “Sep” Stephen was seventh child of
Alfred, Chief Justice and Lieutenant-Gover-
nor. lie was a solicitor in a large practice.
A son of his. Rooert, is Colonel of the
34th Hussars in India ; another. .Lieutenant
Humphrey, is at the front with the North-
umberland Fusiliers; another, Noel, has
joined King Edward’s Horse. Colin is the
only one who kept to the family profession,
the law, and he is the only member of the
family not residing out of the Common-
wealth.
A curious Kaiser item of last, week . -
Before going east the Kaiser adopted the b 1“ i
of appearing unawares in the barracks at mgn , *
silently watching the men. He stood in‘ the. *
tude of Napoleon, and at first the men thong
was a ghost.
Well, wasn’t it?

“F.L. J.” : My old press chum, Samson, of
Melbourne, is proud of the things his
nephew, Commandant ('. R. Samson, of the
British Navy, has been doing. The nephew
has charge of the naval wing of the Royal
Flying Corps. His worst luck is that he is
not an Australian, having been born in Man-
chester 31 years ago. They call him “the
mainspring of the Naval wing,” but that's
nothing to what journalist Samson calls the
youngster.
Chief Justice Way, one of Adelaide's
numerous elderly hard-grafters, has got back
into harness again at the Supreme Court.
His programme during the three months'
leave of absence he applied for has read
thus :
July 2.—Sat in court, awl in the afternoon left
for Sydney, to consult Alexander McCormick about a
growth on the left arm.
•lulv 6.—Arm taken off, high up on the shoulder-
blade.
August B.—Back in Adelaide, presiding at Science
Congress. (Interval here, filled chiefly with neuritis.)
September 25.—Back on University Council.
October 2. —Back in Supreme Court.
And Way is 79 !
The first schoolmasters in Australia were
A illiam Webster and William Richardson.
These, having procured certificates from the
Rev. Richard Johnson (the old First Fleet
chaplain) that they had taught school in
Sydney from Michaelmas, 1793, till Michael-
mas, 1794, were ordered a compensation of
£lO by the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel. The Society promised to con-
tinue the salary in future to such as the
Governor might judge proper. The Govern-
ment, for its part, issued them clothes and a
ration each. In Macquarie’s time things
were not much better for the schoolmaster.
Mathew Hughes, a famous old-time teacher,
sent Secretary Campbell an undertaking in
writing, dated February 5, 1810, that lie
would give six children free education at the
Kissing Point school, and would educate
others at the rate of eightpence per week
for spelling and reading, and one shilling
tier week for writing and accounts, in return
for one ration from the Government stores
daily. This was granted. Things began to
look up the following year, when Mr. Wil-
berforce persuaded Lord Liverpool to
appoint Mr. Thomas Bowden, formerly
schoolmaster at the Great Queen’s Street
Charity School, London, to the post of
schoolmaster in N.S.W., at a salary of £lOO
per annum and a free passage out. with an
allowance of £5O in advance for equipment.
Recent cable:—
The Kaiser is still in Luxembourg supervising
everything.
It used to be “God and Me”; but apparently
the Almighty has been dismissed.
WAR AND TRADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wonder much about the war,
And why these awful things are done,
And what they smite each other for,
And when the battle’s lost and won
Who is the better for the fun.
This thinking made me dream last night,
And I was Holmes upon the track,
Employed in tracing out the fight.
Step after step I dogged it back
Right down to the initial smack.
Clean through the diplomatic rings
In every implicated land
I sorted out and tried all things—-
And found when every clue was scanned
A waif with threepence in liis hand!

The £BO,OOO shown as written off in the past
year was money voted to the co.’s provident
and guarantee fund, established by chairman
I’eter Waite for the benefit of a staff which
was once hard-worked enough to deserve a
lot of subsequent consideration. Only
special writings-off are shown in the table.
Wear and tear of plant and premises are
charged direct to Profit and Loss. The
amount written off in the past year, by the
way, was only £1398, as against £7832 the
year before, so the shrinkage in the past
season’s profit was really a bit worse than
it looks. Heaven only knows what is going
to happen this current year. S. Australia
is up to its neck in trouble. No other State
has been hit in so many places at once. Its
very valuable Broken Hill trade has been
almost knocked out. Its wheat crops are
so much of a failure that in most parts there
won’t be any harvest. Grass is so scarce
that good farm draught horses are being sold
for a few shillings. Add to all that the
stoppage of wool sales and the shrinkage of
wool values, and the State has just as much
as it can struggle with. Elder Smith’s
must suffer severely from most of these
troubles. It lives chiefly on (1) profits
on sales of station and farm supplies, (2)
interest on advances to pastoralists and
farmers and (3) commissions. Sales and com-
missions will shrivel up. Commissions on
property sales, which have been worth some-
thing of late years, will disappear almost
altogether. Interest on advances will be
charged up as usual; but if a co. doing this
kind of business can escape many losses
under such an avalanche of adverse condi-
tions, it will have amazing luck. Good
management alone simply couldn’t save it.
The co. finances so many S. Australian
wool and wheat cockies that, having but a
moderate share capital itself, it has to lean
pretty heavily on depositors. Still, its posi-
tion is easier than it was:—

Other assets. . 177,626 304,466 108,062 64,859
Thus, along with a steady reduction of lia-
bilities. there has been a more rapid reduc-
tion _ of advances, which means that the
holding of cash and liquid securities has
moved up quickly. No changes could suit
the co. better, in view of the double crisis
that has crashed in on the State. And no
changes could better suit the co.’s clients
either; for, assuming that the depositors
, stand to the co., as they are likely to. many
of them being deeply interested as share-
holders. the co. has put itself in a position to
stand by its clients. And some of them will
need it ; for, though S. Aus., like other States,
had a succession of very fine years up to
1913, the men who banked the proceeds don’t
always now hold the properties. They sold
out at extravagant prices to new men, who
started with little except a large hope and a
larger mortgage.
Included with the £1,579,535 of “advances,
etc.,” are “shares in other cos.” These other
cos. no doubt include Elder's Metal and
Mercantile Prop., Ltd., formed to take over
the ore-buying and agency branch which had
been started at Broken Hill. This co. is
probably not now earning postages; so the
parent’s figures will next year get a kick
downstairs from this hoof too.

Twelve months ago it was remarked that,
on the figures, the result was very fine; but
whether things were as good as they looked
depended on the stocktaking. If- they were
iu a fool’s paradise the directors, like sen-
sible men, wanted to find it out quickly;
so they called iu Mr. Louden, one of the
best-known boot manufacturers of Sydney,
and asked him for an independent report on
the stock. “Thoroughly clean, fresh, well-
bought and up-to-date.” he said; and on
this and other things Starkey and Starkey,
the auditors, “are satisfied that the stock is
not over-valued.” Accepting the figures,
then, as they stand, this paper hands its
bouquet of most fragrant adjectives to the
men who have produced a really remarkable
result. On the capital of £85,000 a net
profit, of £25,423 has been made in two years.
And in accomplishing these figures no risks
to speak of have been fastened on to the
shareholders. The whole thing is, in fact,
an object lesson in the art of making a little
capital go a long way. There are three
principal ingredients in the recipe: (1)
none of the capital is eaten up by bricks
and mortar; (2) sales are for cash, so that
book debts don’t absorb capital; (3) the
stock is of the quick-selling, bread-and-
butter variety. By cutting out freeholds and
expensive improvements on leaseholds, and
by cutting out book debts, and by dealing in
goods that can mostly be retailed inside six
the co. made £35,000 go as far as
£150,000 might have gone in another busi-
ness worked on other lines. And. though
there are no gilt-edged freeholds to
represent capital—anyway, none worth
mentioning—the security may be just
as satisfactory. The capital, as before
ri ; the total liabilities are
£18.490. On the other side there are stocks
—the stocks that are reported on by
Bouden and certified by Starkey and Starkey
to be not over-valued —amounting to £54,532
Cash amounts to £4532, book debts and
prepaid charges to only £1419. Another £8690
is in properties, fixtures and plant, etc
Assets, mostly of the sort that could be
realised quickly, and, it seems, at a profit,
therefore represent 28s. per share in excess
ot liabilities. That, of course, takes no
i , u CO j- n * ; x goodwill. In these circumstances
the directors should have little trouble when
presently they invite shareholders to supply
fuither capital for business extensions—
provided that the amount is modest enough
o suggest that there is to be no departure
tiom the policy on which the quite un-
common success of the co. has been built.
On the present look of things, a pref. issue
is most likely.

Amalgamated Wireless (Austral-
asia), Ltd.—When wireless was becoming
a commercial product two cos. got t„ work
in Australia. One, a purely Australian
concern, bought the rights of the Telefunken,
the Berman system which has been doing
such remarkable things during the past few
weeks. Ihe other was an Australian branch
ot the London co. which operates the Mar-
coni patents. These two were keen com-
petitors in a field where there was room for
only one; and 18 months or so back 11. It.
I, nison, being in London, practically carried
through negotiations for an amalgamation,
Jri«l «P a sea of actual and
threatened litigation. Hie new co., which
took oyer the business as from December 1,
V - bas a capital of £140.000 in paid £1
shares. Each party apparently took 70,000
shares, or their value in cash. It is doubtful
i the Marconi business in Australia ever
showed a profit; certainly the Telefunken
co. didnt. The latter (Australasian Wire-
less, Ltd.) made a loss of £2860 in its first
ytai and £93 7 in the following eight months
to the end of November, 1912. From that
date Amalgamated Wireless took the busi-
nesses oyer; but two separate organisations
had to be kept going for the first seven
months, and that cut into profits. Never-
theless for the 19 months to the
end of June, 1914, a surplus of £8616
is shown, after allowing for depreciation;
'n rnL" rn tlus a 4 b- c - div - is paid
x 1" a Patents reserve account
£, 0 is put, and the few pounds over
are carried _ forward. Prospects—under
normal conditions, presumably—are reported
to be good. The new AI L. Navigation Act
should increase profits, and similar regula-
tions are expected in the Commonwealth.
The weak point is the intangible security
Jor the bulk of the capital. “Patent rights,
pun'non a P nd x 1 excl «sive agencies” represent
£90,000 of the capital of £140,000. The
balance is in ships’ stations (£20.895) and
cash and book debts (£31,850). The char-
acter of the patents rights, etc., is not dis-
: bat tbe fact that the co. puts by
£oooo out of a profit of £8616 to protect
them m some way. or provide for con-
tingencies in connection with them, suggests
lmt the £90,000 worth isn't exactly a Great
i yramid of permanence.

There is another £20,000 shown as profit
tor the past year and set aside for contin-
gencies , but as this year’s crop of contin-
?on C Ann if s t 0 be a world’s record, the
£20,000 had better be regarded as never
having been made. The co. will no doubt
lose heavily through disturbance of marine
business ; also in bad times insured premises
be'come much more inflammable than they
are under prosperous conditions. Still
apart from these losses, the co. shouldn’t be
a very bad sufferer. It would be, of course,
if it had to realise its securities; but unless
some other ’Frisco disaster happens it
shouldn’t have to do that. It has enough in
the till to meet something more than
ordinary claims—£ll7.ooo in cash and
another £79.500 in fixed deposits. As cash
premiums are flowing in all the time, the
catastrophe would have to be very sudden
if this nest egg were not sufficient to meet
all demands. That being so, the co. has
merely to hang on till capital values recover ;
and meantime the interest earnings don’t
suffer a fraction. Incidentally, even in these
bad times, there will probably be a few
thousands of surplus to put into some-
thing or other, and the concern which can
make investments now is going to pocket a
lot of profit presently.
The history of the insurance part of the
business is shown next:—

There has been a steady rise in the expense
rate and a fairly steady fall in the loss
rate. The general rise in the cost of living,
which has meant higher salaries, etc., has
had something to do with the rise in the
expense rate; but the chances are that the
development of the personal and other side-
lines of the insurance business has had a
good deal to do with both movements. The
margin—nearly 174 p.c. of the premiums—-is
very excellent. To that underwriting profit
is to be added the income from interest and
rents, £41,117. Thus, less than £4OOO is
drawn from the underwriting profit to pay
the dividend; and all but that trifle of the
profit provided by policy-holders is put by
for their further protection. That protection
depends mainly on three things: (1) the
quality of the risks; (2) the funds in pro-
portion to risks; (3) the quality of the
funds.. As to the first, all one can say is
that, in the table printed above and running
back 20 years, the claims have never ex-
ceeded 65 p.c. of the premiums, and even
in that year there was a substantial profit
on the business; also, judging by the fact
that claims are absorbing less and*less of
the premiums, the risks are better than
ever they were. (2) The capital is £300,000.
the reserves £498.240; total £798,240. The
premiums were £436,154, so the funds are
180 p.c. of the premiums. Put in another
way, the co., assuming that it maintains
its piemium income, could this ye&r meet
losses 4*| times greater than those of its
most disastrous year to date, without calling
on the shareholders for capital. (3) For-
tunately, the co. isn’t likely to be called on
to pay r times more than it ever had to pay
before. For that would involve the sacrifice
of securities. On the whole, thev look a good
}£’ though office and other premises
(£-,62,191) form too big an item; and if
(hey may be overvalued at the moment
there is no visible reason to expect that they
won t be worth 20s. in the £ when normal
conditions return. Also there is no reason
to expect that the co. won’t be able to
nurse all its securities until that happy
time arrives.

As usual it is an unsatisfactory last line;
but the material isn’t available to make it
any better. For, also as usual, the capital
has been increased during the year, and this
paper doesn’t know how many months’ in-
terest the new money carries. The rates of
div. are set out above, while the bonuses
paid to shareholders, and for some obscure
reason always lumped with the dividends,
run from 5 p.c. on purchases to 30 p.c. on
certain commissions. For the previous year
it was reckoned that the divs. would absorb
£22,000, and the various bonuses and
rebates a like amount. For the past year it
seems probable that the dividends and
bonuses, etc., will each take £25,000, or per-
haps a little less. The reserves will then
be £121.398, plus whatever trifle there may
be at the credit of Profit and Loss. The
capital is £381,640, of which £70.000 in
second pref. shares has been issued during
the year, along with a few ordinaries. The
total paid on the ordinaries is £161,640, plus
£2334 in advance of calls —thev are £5
shares, paid, with these few exceptions, to £2.
The co., established in a very small way
in 1881. has been gradually extended until
it can now supply the farmer with practi-
cally all he needs except good seasons ; and’
there are few places where the farmer
has to worry less on that score. Also it can
handle and market all he produces, and
finance his operations. Of course this means
that theie is a lot of money on the hooks
There always is where the customers are
farmers. But in a district like Canterbury
the storekeeper isn’t liable to be often told
that there hasn’t been any harvest and that
the Fill will have to stand for another year.
0 the book debts, advances, etc., don’t mean
the risks that similar figures would involve
in droughtier Australia. Here, however, is
the whole business :

The policy of taking only long-term deposits
is undoubtedly the right one in this kind
of business, though it is more urgently called
for in precarious districts than in one where
regular returns are fairly assured. Lia-
bilities of all sorts total £544,877; capital
and reserves combined amount to about
ioOS.OOO. and the capital is being gradually
increased. Assuming that the assets are
reasonably good the security for the creditors
is therefore exceptional; if the assets rea-
lised only about 10s. in the £, all the co.’s
debts could be paid. And there is no reason
to suspect that the assets are not worth 20s.
m the £. The advances are mostly against
stock, grain, etc., shipped; and grain, at any
rate, isn’t a poorer security since the war
started. Like almost every other trading
concern this one will no doubt be disor-
by the unpleasant behavior of
Vvilham; but there are few who should
suffer less than the man who grows food, and
the less lie suffers the less liis co-operative
agency and finance cos. will suffer. In fact,
in the long run, neither of them may suffer
at all except, of course, in their feelings at
having to accept a higher price for their
gram. etc. They will have to put up with

tairly obvious that (1) ample allowance

the revenue has been much in excess

the development of the iron and steel in-
dustry Newcastle is going to have a future
bigger by far than its past. Luckily for the
conservative old co. it is in a fine position
o meet the outlay which these developments
may call for. Liabilities amount to £9543 •
and although there is only £lOO,OOO of capi-
tal, bank deposits total £7o,ooo—which is
very safe, but isn’t likely to cause profits to
soar to any great heights.

The growth of oyer £50.000 in loans in five
years may look like good business ; but it is
very risky, and if the society has trouble it
will be on account of the excessive propor-
tion of recent advances. In the first place,
they have been made on inflated values •
secondly, on an old loan a fair amount has
been repaid, and rather than lose the lot
the debtor will burst his collar in the effort
to pay up ; whereas on a two- or three-year-

on the mortgagee’s hands. And this will

soon become evident now that war and
drought have disorganised business and
thrown out of employment numbers of those
who are the most likely patrons of building
societies. The co.’s own creditors (mainly
depositors) are well enough protected;
securities would need to shrink nearly 50
p.c. before their money would be endangered.
As they get up to 6 p.c. interest they will
be very foolish if they think of disturbing
it.

The London Stock Exchange isn’t open
yet, and that explains why the mining quotes
on Australian ’Changes are, generally
speaking, much poorer than the investment
quotes. In the case of tin stocks bad slumps
were, of course, inevitable, for most of the 1
old prices were based on an abnormal metal
market; but the copper section has probably
suffered more than the circumstances call
for; and, even allowing that lead prices were
more or less artificial before the war, the
market for the most solid of the Broken Hill
stocks is much too low. As for investments,
there would have been a lower range of
values in any case, owing to the drought;
and the fact that money will be dear for a
long while to come makes it pretty certain
that prices will not return to the old level
even when the Peace arrives. Taking those
circumstances into account the market is
holding up very well indeed. An indication
of the hardening of the money market was
given last week, when the rates for many
overdrafts were put up one-half p.c. as from
October 1. In N. S. Wales the competition
of the Government for the banks’ money is
likely to push up the rate still further.
Sulphide Corporation got busy again at
the Cockle Creek (N.S.W.) smelters this
week, and the co. is now buying ore and
doing custom work. The furnaces at Kembla
are also in blast; that co., however, is not
buying ore, but is treating it for customers
on the old tariff.
“P. and C.’’: The Ardlethan Options took
over several shows, worked them for a time,
and then handed them back as not being
worth the money. Prospects being poor at
Ardlethan, it was reported that (lie Malay
Peninsula was being tried; but apparently
they didn’t get anything there either. Any-
way, shareholders have had no information
about it. The most cheerful thing I can
find out (and I can’t find this out with much
certitude) is that, of the £36,000 capital,
£2OOO is left. I don’t know how it comes to
be left; but if it really is left I should like
my whack of it. It it wouldn’t be impudent
to mention it, I should also like to see the
report of a thorough audit.

Carpathia (N.S.W.) has suspended pro-
duction until the tin market finds itself. In
12 months the mine produced £31,881 worth
of tin oxide and made a profit of £11,663.
equal to slightly over 36 p.c. ; but tin can
slump 30 p.c. while you’re turning over in
your sleep, and, in fact, it did recently fall
away so alarmingly that old Mount Bischoff
(Tas.) is now being run on the co-operative
system, the workers receiving 75 p.c. of the
value of the tin recovered, less certain
charges. Briseis and the Pioneer (Tas.)
are struggling through on half-time, but most
of the Queensland and New England
(N.S.W.) mines are closed down altogether.
Metallurgist W. H. Wesley, recently from
Mount Morgan, has been appointed general
manager at the Bangadang mine, near
Adelong (N.S.W.). After pointing out that
the mine requires opening up, his preliminary
report states that mining facilities are excel-
lent and that the ore isn’t particularly
difficult to treat. Some of tlie crushing stuff
sent to the mill is estimated to average
lSdwt. per ton, and with treatment actually
in progress the battery will soon have some-
thing to say. Another shaft is being sunk.
* * * •
New Burragorang (N.S.W.), which has
sunk its shaft to 805 ft., intends to go down
another lift in search of payable ore. But
possibly the continuation of the three eastern
levels is just as important as the sinking;
and, fortunately, at 225 ft. the deepest level
(No. 6) is showing Tin. of fairly good ore on
the footwall side. The lode is very narrow,
but £2O per ton is worth having.
* * * *
Stanley Low, formerly of B. H. Block 10
(N.S.W.). and late of Burraga, has shifted
camp to the West and taken charge of the
Corinthian. There are some big bodies of
ore in this show, but latterly returns from
the oxidised mill have been indifferent. Work-
ing costs come to under 10s., and Doolette
and party, who have risked a good deal of
capital in the venture and hold most of the
shares, hope to do well some day. Meantime
a sulphide mill is being installed, and the co.
is busy on development.

1898 from £22,000 to £45,000, in 1899 from
£23 000 to £38,000, and in 1900 from £26,000
to £47,000; and in 1901 they averaged about.
£40,000. Since then the monthly output has
never, except once, gone above £50,000 or
fallen below £40,000. The total revenue to
date is well over 91 millions sterling.
Mining is still the biggest turnip in West-
ralia’s garden. It furnishes about 60 per
cent, of the exports, finds employment for
nearly 16,000 men, and supports over 20
per cent, of the population. The gold indus-
try finds or helps to find a living for most
of them, and to give the small man a chance
to make money 32 State batteries have been
scattered over the fields. Eight of these
have been erected in the last three years.
M ith af ew exceptions their efficiency is
good. Latterly substantial reductions in the
cost of treatment have been made, and it is
expected that these reductions will enable
miners thrown out of work on account of
the war to profitably'.tackle ore which was
too low-grade to pay at the old rates. As
regards tin and other base metals, that will
probably have to be stored until after the
German Empire has been either crumbled or
humbled. the State Government has
arranged to make advances and so prevent
mines being closed down.

Including what the prospectors got, Edna
May’s output to the end of September was
worth close on £150,000. Ten dividends,
totalling £53,000, have been paid since the
beginning of last December, and the amount
distributed, which was at first 2s. a month,
and latterly 35., is tipped to be ss. or 6s. a
month before long. Like the Bullfinch, it is
within 200yds. of an old goldfields track, and
in a locality that old-timers reckoned no
account.
Bullfinch (W.A.) says it is looking better.
A winze has been sunk 64ft. below the 310 ft.
level in northern-series ore worth between
355. and 40s. per ton, and the management
thinks the continuation of this shoot will be
picked up when a new level is driven at
400 ft. The same make of ore is stoping
beyond expectations in the levels above the
310 ft., and a new branch lode, picked up at
the 210 ft. level some months ago, is also
credited with being a good thing. A winze is
now being sunk to 310 ft. on this body in 345.
values.
From Weston’s (W.A.) : Edna May has
cut through the expected granite bar at the
No. 3 level and should be into the reef about
the middle of October, if not sooner. A big
effort is being made to increase the output,
and the September return is expected to send
a cold chill down the backs of the bears. In
the higher levels the mine is looking splendid.
Edna May Central’s new mill is going well,
the latest stamp-duty being over 11 tons per
day. A start has been made to open up
the No. 2 level.
Black Range West (W.A.) applied the
other day for six months’ exemption. The
Black Range, next door, came along and
opposed the application on the ground that
if the West got what it asked for the water
would rise and interfere with the working of
the Black Range. Finally the West got a
month to go on with, and a recommendation
from the Warden for the remainder of the
term.
* * * *
The Augusta Co. (W.A.) has installed
cyanide vats and intends to have another go
at ore treatment.
* * * *
Chaffers (W.A.) has just about com-
pleted the reorganisation of its reduction
plant, and hopes, with the aid of suction gas
and other cost-cheapening devices, to shortly
earn something for shareholders. This
paper’s hope on the subject is stronger than
its faith.
* * * *
Mountain Queen (W.A.) is “up against
it.” The Queen mine has been worked out,
and there are no funds to procure a treat-
ment plant for the co.’s second string, the
Transvaal. A good deal of sulphide ore has
been opened up in this show, but it is bur-
dened with arsenic and other undesirable
stuff, which makes it doubtful whether
profits would be earned.
* * * *
A prospector writes to say that, owing to
puff pars appearing in the daily papers, he
was induced to try his luck at Randall’s
(W.A.), and has returned disgusted. There
is no hope for it, he says.
Adelaide Enterprise (W.A.) has got 70oz.
from 130 tons. It’s the quantity that is the
trouble.
* * * *
Westralia’s despised Collie coalfield now
produces about £12,000 worth of fuel a
month, or a trifle less than it did 12 months
ago, when six mines were working. Five
now contribute to the output almost equally.
* * * *
Driving north at No. 6 under the old indi-
cator formation at Birthday Tunnel, Ber-
ringa (Vic.), has brought out a bag full of
specimen stone. This will help the co. to
keep going with the big development scheme
it has in hand towards the Kangaroo end of
the claim, and in crosscutting for fresh
makes of stone in the deep ground. Work
■always ends in getting plenty of quartz but
very little gold.
If you heard A. D. Sachse, ex-Minister of
the Crown, talking about Mary Mac you’d
think that Melbourne had picked up in Wes-
tralia something even better than Edna May.
There may be reason for this ecstasy, for
after a poor beginning two lucky tributors
did good things: from 2780 tons they got
1151 oz. off the plates and 4470 z. out of the
cyanide plant. Their cash cut has been
£7050 and the co.’s £lO4l. believes
in mascottes, so he has taken on the two pro-
spectors as manager and metallurgist, after
giving them a consideration to forego the rest
of their tribute. The cheerful news of late is
the better grade of the open cut, a yield of
2500 z. from stone broken in a big crosscut
worked in a tunnel through a 64ft.
formation, and the estimated addition
of 24,000 tons of (idwt. dirt to reserve
through a discovery made in a rise. On such
developments Sachse naturally wants to own
the whole country-side, and the result is
that Mary Mac is the proud owner of six
blocks covering an outcrop 600 ft. long. •
South Wattle Gully is being worked by
a Melbourne crowd to pick up a payable
run of gold at Chewton, Castlemaine (Vic.).
George Lansell spent a fortune over the same
quest at the Francis Ormonu, near by. lie
was tempted by the early riches of Forest
Greek and by well-defined formations. The
South Wattle tent is pitched where the
Silurian carries the same fossils as it does
at Bendigo. Others have tried and given
up. Hartrick, of Edna May fame, gives the
show a sporting chance, and as 2700 tons
have averaged sdwt. he may be right. Most
of the dirt comes from Shanks’s reef, and
the co.’s new plant will try its luck on stone
above the 215 ft. level. The Francis Ormond
reef will be a side-show. Tributors are to
help to keep the wheels moving.
The Stawell (Vic.) options, held by the
Great Boulder, are to be persevered with.
The workings are to be unwatered to 1400 ft.
and some money spent in diamond drilling
at that point. Hitherto operations have
been chiefly confined to bore-holing at 1200 ft.,
where values have been a bit on the poor
side. The same co.’s Alaska venture is
not shaping as well as was expected, and the
proposed visit of general-manager Hamilton
to the chilly locality is said to be “off.”
* * * *
The scheme to get cash for a railway from
Stanley to Mount Balfour (Tas.) is dead.
What is to become of the Mount Balfour
copper mines and engineer Mertz’s much-
thumbed report rests with the Tasmanian
Government, for its receiver now holds pos-
session of the line, with instructions to pay
the Mount Balfour Copper Mines, No Lia-
bility, a fair sum for plant and work done.
The blow-out of the Balfour field, after
Mount Lyell and Queen Street had spent a
small fortune on it, pricked the whole bubble,
and left the railway and dock scheme to die
a natural death.
* * * *
Radium Hill has broken off negotiations
with the “enemy” who promised to be a
customer. Now the contract with the
German firm is off, the old trouble about
securing a market crops up again—along
with a call. Some of this co.’s bromide
realised £l7 10s. per milligram; but even
this doesn’t ensure prosperity unless a
reasonable quantity of standardised radium
bromide can be sent to market. As was
pointed out at the recent meeting, it is
ridiculous to expect big profits from an
average of 21 tons of uranium concentrates
per week, though Radcliff. the co.’s chemist,
is quite confident that he can make the
Woolwich plant pay if he gets 10 tons to
work on. More vigorous mine development
is absolutely essential.
* * * *
The Ratrut Basin Tin Co. had a meeting
in Sydney the other day, and talked a good
deal about a dredge for which a quotation
had been got from Holland. The Dutch-
men, it seems, were asked by this patriotic
Australian co. to “submit designs for a
dredge of the very latest type” ; but as the
Dutch dredge-makers don’t seem to know
what the latest type is, “the original design
was amended to carry some Australian im-
provements.” Then Eurooe blew up and
the contract wasn’t let; but at the meeting
in Sydney “the chairman impressed upon
shareholders the fact that, should the
arrangements for the construction of the
dredge in Holland be proceeded with, there
will be no necessity to make calls for six
months.” Apparently nothing was done about
it at the meeting, and the co. will deserve
to have grindstones thrown at it if any-
thing has been done about it since, except
in the way of notifying the Dutchmen—
who aren’t even our allies —that Australia
now needs every bit of work it can lay its
hands on, and can’t afford to send a single
sovereign out to foreign workshops.
Tongkah, the Australian-owned dredg-
ing proposition in Siam, is stacking
its tin, and has suspended divs. to
make financing easier. Most of the Malay
shows have shut down altogether, and Sin-
gapore and other centres thereabouts are
in .a dreadful state of gloom. The collapse
of the rubber boom had given them a bad
shaking even before the war started. But
as the European trouble will increase the
demand for canned goods in some directions,
there probably will be a market for the
metal before long. This will be helped by
the fact that Holland is the distributor of a
very big part of the European requirements;
and Dutch ports are neutral. The Bulle-
tin isn’t, however, talking about the price.
“Whacker”: The attempt of the W.A.
Chamber of Mines to initiate the contract
system at Youanmi has failed. The mine
was closed down for 11 weeks, but the men
were prepared for a longer holiday. The
co. relied on the collapse of the foreigners,
who represent 60 p.c. of the underground
employees; but they stood up to it all right.
The co. claimed that contract would lower
costs 25 p.c. The union, on the other hand,
alleges that the extra woi k is done at the
peril of men’s lives, and leelares that the
sauatoriums of the State arc full of con-
tractors who are dying ( “miners’ com-
plaint.” This is the ground on which the
union has fought the proposed general adop-
tion of the system. The “bonus system.”
as it has now been appl.ed to Youanmi,
means that the men, if working in bad
places, such as shafts an i rises, will get
extra money. It is not contract in any
shape or form, so there is no truth in the
yarn circulated in the Eastern States that
the Youanmi men have cave l in.
German ball mills are being bumped out
by British makes in Westralia. One of the
Newell brand has lately been installed at
the Associated Northern Co.’s Ora Banda
leases, and another has been ordered by the
Corinthian North. Other cos. have at last
decided to give Krupps the cold shoulder
whenever possible.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, October 5, 1914.
My Dear Artni, —•
This year’s Spring Meeting saw a chasten-
ing hand laid upon those extravagant freaks
we look for on the Randwick lawn. Our
Best People lost the crude, bedizened appear-
ance which is Mrs. Newly Rich’s usual notion
ol a race frock. The franklv white-washed
countenances of our Society damsels were
less conspicuously masked in cosmetics. And
a suggestion of wheatfields and waving corn-
flowers came along with the Dolly Yarden
hats and panniers of muslin frocks sprigged
with old-fashioned flowers. Local Society,
which had denied itself for once the over-
loaded garniture it delights in, looked better
dressed than for many a long race day.
The sub-royal pews in the grandstand at
Saturday’s meet had a highly respectable
Scotchbyterian appearance, with a slab of
plain cook-and-1 aundress (in her best toque)
to give solid avoirdupois to the party. Munro
Ferguson, in the grey sac suit of every day,
was topped by a flat bowler of the same
shade. Governors of all sizes are addicted
to this Quaker shade, though for once our
own Strickland dodged its alluring call for
a sadder color.
Excellency Helen M. Ferguson’s delicate
intellectual face was embedded in a good
Presbyterian hat of sober mien, with a small
piece of prim white feather —very nicely
behaved —sitting up in front. There was
nothing unduly exciting about the quiet pale-
hlue gown that went with this millinery. The
Admiralty lady, in raven garb, had the girlish
beauty of Miss Mary Strickland- —in a vivid
blue frock that was en suite, as they say in
the upholstery department, with her corn-
flower eves—next door. Mrs. Harry Finn
recklessly swathed a slim figure, which is the
envy of the Fat, in one of the new black
capes or bags. Two daughters wore their at-
tractive auburn locks under the usual spring
foliage. Prime Minister Andy Fisher and the
Ferguson were locked in conversation while
the bookies were yelling the odds.
The Yaralla millionairess, Miss Eadith
Walker, perched for a while in the gilt-edged
Government House pews, with Mrs. Toby
Barton and the large, beneficent Mrs. Brown-
lew —the last in a black toque tliat was like
a skyrocket, and a frock that looked as if it
might burst if the lady inside rashly took a
second cup of tea. Miss Walker chose, or in-
sisted on wearing, a violent green costume
with a hat of the same color trimmed with a
purple ribbon.
At Saturday’s race meet one of the most
attractive damsels was Gilln Aitken, now
of Springwood, once of Melbourne. The girl’s
fashionably lean appearance was terraced in
pale pink filmy flounces like nicely-cut slices
of clouds. In attendance was Gilla’s faith-
ful swain, young Lamroek. who is still at
Sydney Uni. Mrs. Pat Osborne’s dimple
was observed in an environment of race hat
and emerald-green blanket outfit. Mrs. Tony
Hordern, in dark blue of the cosy tailored
build, was crowned by an exhilarating round
white hat.
Tartan in subdued colors was a fad of
the dress parade. Little Mrs. George Earp
was clothed in a tartan so dark that its
pattern almost fainted away if you looked
into it. W. G. Layton’s tali lady had a bit
ot brighter Scotch stuff tucked into the
waist of her dark-blue gown. Mrs. Tom
Eolin in blue —there seems to be a deep blue
baze about this bit of race week—was
elegantly fixed in the matter of fluffy head-
gear. Mrs. Geoffrey Fairfax, in fascinating
raven garments had put her trim locks into
a saucy semi-plateau, with a wreath of
white blooms round the brim. There has
been a good deal of black in the soft
diaphanous rags, beloved of later-day
woman, fluttering round the Members’ Stand
this week.
Aide Foxton, a Queensland militiaman,
who dogs the broad shadoAv of Ex. Ferguson
since the latter shed his plumed warriors
for active service, is a quiet, inoffensive
Help who looks incapable of treading on a
worm, but would no doubt make a dreadful
mess of any ichthyosaurus that truculently
crossed his country’s path.
As a feminine garb de luxe, capes are a
failure. They have a granny, wet-weather-
wrap effect on the submerged finery of the
skirt. A' fair number of the long mid-Vic-
torian cover-alls were in evidence; but the
wearers looked too baggy to eyes accustomed
to the walking-stick pattern of the modern
figure.
Drapery is flung on anyhow -after the
wild, impassioned style of a Futurist when
he hurls his paints at a canvas that never
did him any harm. Tiers of stuff are over-
laid on the raw material, so to speak, and
then the whole lot is dragged up into a lump.
These frocks seem to he laid out in a moment
of frenzy by a fist working on a roll of stuff
that will stand the strain of much tying-up
in knots. Still, they are in the latest mode,
and only intended for the Rich, so the
deserving poor need not gird at convolutions
which are beyond the ken of the little dress-
maker round the corner.
The Charlie Regans, of Tamworth. are
ia town for the present rush of hoofs.
Mrs. S. Vandenberg got ahead of competi-
tion the other race day in a confection
(“frock” is too dull a word to apply to this
event) of champagne moire. The long
Russian bodice was allied to a French-look-
ing tunic which functioned with the bodice
under a sapphire girdle. The champagne
and sapphire-striped skirt hung meekly in a
narrow line under the tunic fuss above it.
The dove-like grey plumage that was such
a craze last spring has this year been almost
wiped out by the more assertive floral gar-
ments of voile—a fragile, elusive garb that
blows which way the wind listeth. Mrs. A.
E. Hughes, a black-eyed young witch, revived
the soft glory of grey shimmer at Randwick
with a fleck of blush rose to tone it up.
Tail-less ermine, an obsession of 1914, trailed
round the wearer’s shoulders in a stole that
crept down to a large flat muff of the same
snowdrift pelt.
There’s a show of work this week in
Anthony Horderns’ New Art Gallery. Mayor
Richards opens it before this reaches you.
Sydney Tech, students are chiefly responsible
for the goods.
The Alexandra Hospital for Children con-
tinues to hoist signals of distress. The "Dolls’
Carnival” having been put out of action tem-
porarily, there’s a new scheme mothered by
the Willie Cooper dame. This includes a
country collection campaign to get into busi-
ness on or about November 18.
Here is a compliment as a set-off to the
insults that have been thrown our Austra-
lian way. It is in a new American novel,
“The Supplanter,” by Grace Boylan, and
an Australian girl is being described by a
Californian: —-
O my, yes, she’s a Colonist, all right. You ought
to hear her speak. She is a lot more English than
any English gill. The tones just roll up from her
throat like music, and the vowels are so pure you
can fairly see them with your eyes.
It is kind of her—l’m meaning Grace
Boylan, of course.
News comes by the last overseas mail of
the Australian War Contingent Association
in London. This corps is working in its
own paddock instead of being swallowed up
in the Australian Women’s British Help
Society. In the midst of various gatherings
of the kind there was 'one at the Trocadero
which produced an unusual type of bushed
Australian. This exile stood up to inform
the meeting (which dabbed its eyelashes
with lace handkerchiefs to show its sym-
pathy) that she hadn’t met an Australian
man or woman during the 15 years she had
been in England. Also (mild sensation)
she was very glad to be amongst those who
had been able to vote in Australia, a privi-
lege she herself had never been able to use.
This good woman must have a preter-
natural genius for getting into out-of-the-
way holes in John Bull’s antheap. Most
Australians And it hard to lose their own
suburb even on the war-scarred face of
Europe. Mrs. Smithereens, of Darlingliurst.
grumbles that she can’t make a modest bid
for a Paris hat without meeting Mrs. Judah,
of Potts Points, who is buying a waggon-
load of millinery at the same establishment.
Perhaps the Trocadero exile has been rural-
ising in the Isle of Man.
High Commissioner George Reid took the
chair —a large one—at the big meeting on
August 19 when this Australian War Con-
tingent Association was formed. The crowd
bristled with ex-Governors and other nabobs ;
and Agents-General fell over each other
with loud, applause. The voices of former
sub-royalties Denman, Islington (Maori-
land’s late cocked hat). Brassey and Chelms-
ford surged through the eorroboree. Finally
the company took the pledge to help with
cash or service till the War ripened into the
Peace.
The Hunter Whites, of Havilah ; the Buck-
lands, of Pine Ridge; and the A. P,
Tnggses. from Yass —all fine, woolly people
are in town for the horse carnival.
Harry Lauder, and Harry Lauder’s large
plaid socks, and Harry Lauder’s ain lassie (I
understand this is the placid Mrs. Lauder)
have been in Sydney after a successful raid
on Maoriland. A much bigger gun lias, how-
ever, lately gone off in Europe, and the little
man and his chuckle have already been
almost forgotten in the din of the report.
The same old hat is again passed round.
On October 17 a concert organised by pianist
Yvonne Leverrier (Mrs. Cliarvin) is going
to shake the Town Hall rafters in aid of the
French Red Cross Fund. The French colony
in this city will support the Leverrier effort to
the last sou. And the Australian public,
which is propping up little Belgium’s cause!
besides struggling to supply half a dozen
hungry war-chests and forage departments,
will make an exhaustive search for an extra
half-crown, and drop it in the cap of Fran-
cois. Mr. George Pla.voust (honorary secre-
tary) and lion, concert manager .1. E. Brown-
low are giving the business end a good hard
push.
The Little Theatre surged with the minor
excitement of a matinee for the Belgian cloth-
ing fund the other afternoon. Mrs. Alex.
Gordon. Kathleen O’Connor, Eily Malyon
and actor Ford in a sketch. Bryce Carter
behind the ’cello, and other performers
bustled through a programme of considerable
length and fierce patriotism. The patriotism,
however, went lame or tumbled down the
back stairs at the end of the entertainment.
At any rate, while the plain citizen was
gathering up his hat to depart without the
support of the National Anthem, there was a
shocked silence for quite two minutes. Where
hod that hard-worked tune hidden itselfV
The stage was empty, and nothing but awfui
suspense fell on the listening ear. Then,
after moments packed with the most fearful
torments, ihe familiar notes blared forth
from the cave under the stage, and the audi-
ence breathed again. The whole company,
which included some of our Best People, had
merely dashed into hiding before they had
ventured on the ancient ditty. When our
most Expensive Suburbs refuse to be seen in
public with the old tune on their lips, you
can guess that it's been having a simply
terrible time of overwork. “Oh. that we two
were Maying" is also doing much service
at these patriotic performances. It’s generally
sung, as Kathleen O’Connor sang it. with
an intense expression and a slow sob gurg-
ling up the windpipe. For anyone who is
inclined to laugh and grow fat the plaintive
dirge is a fine antidote.
There’s a mention of Dr. Isabel Ormiston
going to the fray with a British unit of the
Bed Cross Society. She is handy to the
trouble, being on the other side of the map
on a semi-professional holiday. Her ustfal
routine—inspecting the eyes, ears and tooth-
ache of the Young Idea in Tassy’s Isle—ls
thus likely to be dislocated for some months
to come.
Dr. Ilardstah. a South Australian now
located in Washington (U.S.A.), has
recently acquired the Butler prize at the
George Washington ’Varsity. This reward
is for ornhthalmology. Anyone who can get
a prize for a thing with a name like that
deserves well of his adopted city.
Let’s hope fiddler Kreisler. reported
wounded in the right arm while fighting
with the Austrians (lie belongs to that now
distressful country), insured his valuable
limb before buckling on his armor.
He is probably the world's first violin
—or was, before the alleged shot made
a hole in his priceless muscle —and
is deserving of honorable mention for being
also one of the most generous in helping
stragglers up the ladder. Donald Mcßeath,
the Sydney youngster who went off with his
fiddle in the wake of John McCormack,
attracted the notice of Kreisler in N’York a
few months ago, and the great man at once
offered to give him lessons for nothing.
Hon. sec. Blanche d’Alpuget, of the
Madeline Collins concert committee, expects
about £l6O as the profits of the girl’s recent,
warble. Considering the patriotic haze
which obscures everything but martial drums,
this is much better than might have been
expected.
State School babes will turn out their
toes in a big patriotic show on October
14. The Agricultural Ground will be the
Place of Boots on that exciting day. Hun-
dreds of feet are already in fine marching
order, and the juvenile bodies thereof will
form themselves into the best imitation of a
flag that they and their teachers can manage.
The idea of bringing out to N.S.W. num-
bers of Belgian widows may be draped in
black ci-gpe forthwith as likely to lead to com-
plications. Two-thirds of the Australian
people are probably prepared to keep on giv-
ing everything, except a little income to go
on with themselves, to little Belgium and a
long and fearsome list of war funds. No
scheme to bring people so passionately
attached to their own country as the Bel-
gians is likely to be satisfactory. The wives
of officers slaughtered in defence of that coun-
try are certain to look askance at charity in
a foreign land. Peasant women who are ex-
pected by optimists to rush the notion of
doing chores in a strange land may shy at
our saucepans if they get here. Amongst the
few Belgians who have made their
home in Sydney for a while one
remembers the Wiegands. He was the
one great organist who has ever been
in permanent command of our Town
Hall organ. Both Wiegand and his wife
were natives of the now distressful battle-
ground. Neither were ever entirely happy
away from their home-flats and fields. As
for quartering many presumably fascinating
young Belgian widows in Australian homes
as guests—what did Sam Weller’s father
say about this attractive species? .
The attractive little lady who has been
matron of the Darwin Hospital for a while
has captured something in the military up
there. He surrendered without firing so
much as a bonbon. She’s the Miss Tait who
looked so blooming after working in the
mission hospitals in Papua, and before that
she was matron at Thursday Island. These
alleged deadly climates seem to agree with
some, of our women remarkably well. The
wedding occurs in Darwin before November.
Perhaps you’ve seen Miss Tait’s writing in
The Bulletin. If you haven’t you’ve
missed some rattling good stuff.
Sister McKenzie, a Prince Alfred Hos-
pital Nightingale, is one of a squad who
have stolen or begged leave of absence to go
to the Fight. She’s a star surgical nurse,
and was usually the- mighty MacCormick’s
helping hand in the P.A.H. operating arena.
Miss McKenzie is to join the conquering
Alexander in London, and expects to be
attached to him when lie gets to work among
the wounded. She’s a Victorian, and lias
never been off this continent before, so vari-
ous relatives hurried to this port to see her
safely off the shore.
The genial Mr. ••Boh" Bell, a howler of
great prowess, and managing director of the
North Coast ,Steam Co., is due here hy the
Osterley from London.
Leonard Berwick has torn himself away
from this appreciative city, and scurried off
to America by the Niagara. The thin piano-
poet had the good luck to get in first, and
skim the cream off the concert milk before
too many rival attractions, followed by the
row in Europe, smashed the protit out of
piano thumping. Pianist Harold Bauer, the
greatest of his kind we've heard here for
years, got the other sort of luck, the sort
that always comes in buckets-full.
The George Simpson bridal pair (she
used to be Dorothy Stephen) left Sydney by
express to catch the Otway at Adelaide.
The news that Prof. MaeCallum and his
wife got through safely from Germany to
London is not surprising. The little pro-
fessor could have masked his Scotch accent
in a profound silence, while Mrs. Mac., who
is German, could have replied fluently to
Teuton inquiries. However, there’s no record
of any trouble, and they’re peacefully located
in London W.
Londoners are eagerly staring at Arthur
Burgess’s picture of the Australian navy.
It’s on view in the window of the N.S.W.
Agent-General’s office.
E. Hasemann, of Banaualand. a natural-
ised Australian of Norwegian birth, has
given nn the notion of trying to dodge the
mines of the North Sea and skip across to
his motherland. When the last mail bolted
down the English Channel the Norwegian-
Australian was quietly camped in London.
Mrs. Leslie Willsallen and sister Olive
had their trip to Yewrope cut short by the
uproar of Milliam’s legions. They’re mak-
ing a bee-line for home and gum trees via
America.
The "Bob’’ Andersons, of Lindfield and
the Allen Taylor firm, are homeward bound
via Vancouver. Just now they’re in Canada,
and catch a craft leaving those icy shores
about the end of October.
The Salon de Luxe management is getting
into the war-relief business with a spectacu-
lar ball on October 14. The notion is to
collect results and post the cheques to the
war chief in Melbourne. A postscript will
ask that this should be a nest-egg towards a
whole clutch of practical help for those hard-
est hit by the loss of the submarine AEI.
In the comparative seclusion of a rocky
lane behind Paling’s hangs a flag with the
Red Cross. Undisturbed by the caterwauls,
yelps, wails of fiddles and bleats of young
and tender sopranos who practise in the
adjacent musical rabbit warren, Mrs. Bob
MacKinnon sorts produce. This depot is a
hungry maw that swallows up fresh eggs,
jam, butter and barndoor fowls. Everything
perishable is sold for the cause. I forget
which cause, but it’s connected with the Big-
Fight. Country folk are sending steady
help to this little store, and anything from a
day-old chicken to a Christmas ham will be
received with enthusiasm.
Responding to the battlecry, “Pyjamas to
the Front!” the Girls' Realm office has turned
itself into a Red Cross sewing-bee tlmt buzzes
from early morn to dusty eve. Shirts are
occupying a proud pre-eminence over pyja-
mas for the moment. One thing is
sure sewing is going to see a great
revival as a result of the present trouble.
Also, it’s bringing to the front —the Austra-
lian domestic front : —all the versatile qual-
ities of the average suburban housewife, who
has her own chore to do before she begins a
day’s work for the country.
Some day or other, when Peace blows in.
we’ll have to organise a relief fund for the
. honorary concert managers who are making
heroic efforts to steer feminine committees
through the Patriotic tidal wave. The poor
man who is supposed to add to his bread
and butter by taking a percentage of the
profits of the box-office is nowadays collect-
ing nothing but bitter reproaches if results
are not up to schedule. Will some local
millionaire found a home for distracted or
decayed concert managers in 1915?
fashion stalks boldly enough in the shop
windows of this congested hub. Wonder-
ful frocks, laid out in terraces of little
flounces, and bunched up behind in under-
studies of the camel’s hump, reveal the
deadli intent of foreign model builders to
make the joyful spring rag as complicated
as. they can. As 1914 clotlies-pegs (fem-
inine) must be of the lean kine, the fat
can only suffer spasms of deep-green envy
as they gaze at a gown that looks like a
window curtain in lumps and knots and
fits.
The William McLinen lady and a daughter
went off to London in the last outgoing Blue
Funnel craft. It isn’t much of a time to go
to Europe, but they’ll have plenty of excite-
ment for their good Australian money.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

The NELSON “ BANKER ” Carbonating Machine
MAKES 810 MONEY QUICK AND SURE.
There's something definite in that statement! Best of it, it's “TRUE.” There’s big money
in SODA WATER, and we can put you in the right way to get some of the harvest.
Do you know —
That the price of ordinary Soda Water (factory made) is about, per doz 1/-
That Twenty-four doz. would cost 24/-
That Twenty-four doz. made with the “BANKER” costs you only 2/-
Which means a handsome profit to somebody of 22/-
On every two gross of Soda Water ?
Til is is why the “BANKER,” as a medium for making money, should appeal to every live
Hotelkeeper, Caterer, Soft-drink .Vendor, etc.
The “BANKER” is a complete machine, with Bottling Rack connected. It has been
designed especially for economy of space, and to meet the demands for a practical machine at
low cost ■'
£lO deposit will be sufficient to land a complete plant at your door.
It turns out crisp, snappy Soda Water in 3 minutes. Thoroughly
satisfactory every way.
Nelson’s Iceless Interior Fountains
are Hip finest in the world. There is abundant evidence to prove that fact. Ask any authority
in the Soda-Fountain business; they’ll tell you they wouldn’t have the other kind on their mind.
You want, dependability—freedom from all the nagging little annoyances—faults—failures—
soon found in machines of inferior make.
The machine you want is a “NELSON’S,” to make “good’’ this Summer. You want it
“NOW.” too, if you want to “get in.” Every day delayed means your competitor getting a
“move on” in advance of you. Therefore, act “NOW!” Sit down and write us. Ask us to
send vou full particulars.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 5, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Auditorium was crammed to the ven-
tilators with patriotism last Wednesday
evening, the occasion being a concert in aid
or the French and Belgian Patriotic Funds.
liow shall 1 picture to you the splendor of
the proceedings ! In the middle of the bal-
cony was a huge Union Jack. Behind it
lurked the 0.-U. and Lady Helen—he a
typical figure of Empire in evening clothes,
she pensively graceful in a blue and black
covering with a grey feather “boa” and
bouquet of crimson roses. With them were
the French Consul, in a dazzling glitter of
uniform; and his small wife, in white and
black lace; Lady Doris Blackwood, in pale
blue; and Aide Foxton. The aide was not
so much with them as of them, if you grasp
m.v meaning. He hovered watchfully on the
outskirts of the party as though to frustrate
any attempt at a flanking movement. There
also were the Hennessys—she in a gold bro-
cade cloak and mirabou feathers, lie in one
of those good old British costumes that are
famed wherever the flag flaps. I assure you,
my dear, I felt the traditional lump in my
throat as I looked at that worthy couple.
Girls sold programmes at Is. each, and also
pinned bows of colors on to unsuspecting
coats and then rattled collection tins in the
weavers’ faces. The bows worked out at an
average of about 2s. 6d. each—a profit of
roughly 1000 per cent. The Symphony
Orchestra played, some Repertory mummers
drilled by Rose Seaton staged Joan of Arc
in tableaux and blank verse, and there was
the usual jibbing curtain to lend a light
touch to the proceedings. The show wound
up with France singing the Marseillaise,
while Britannia, Belgium and their young
lent moral support in the limelight.
The war lias killed Major Arthur Huglies-
Onslow. Australia has a sort of side-long
interest in him, inasmuch as his brother
was the argumentative little R.N. Captain
vjio raised dust and pamphlets against the
Naval bosses hereabouts, and then sailed
wrathfully back to England. The contro-
versialist is on active service, of course.
He is the sort of man who would do the
War Office a serious mischief if it tried to
hold him back when there was any fighting
in progress.
The V.A.S. sketch exhibition opened at
the Albert-street Galleries, Eastern Hill, on
September 25, and the public will be
allowed to gaze upon it until October 11.
Over 200 works are catalogued, and they
range from good to tripe. Leslie Wilkie, W.
Beckwith Innes, A. Colquhoun and Janie
Whyte have some fair little efforts, and a
clever monochrome chalk drawing, “Sad
Thoughts,” by Meyer D. Joel, is hung among
the etchings. I saw the show on a wet day,
and there wasn’t what you could veraciousiy
term a seething concourse present. To be
explicit, there were three depressed citizens,
who plainly didn’t know what a red seal
meant.
Artist Arthur Streeton showed 15 views
of Sydney Harbor last week, at the Fine
Art Studio in the Centreway, and the massed
effect was to make you feel glad you were
alive. Each of them interprets a different
mood of the Harbor’s beauty, yet each catches
the spirit or tang or breath of Sydney itself.
The impressionism is so quick and truthful
that you quite expect the canvas to change
while you look at it. Painter Phillips-Fox
has also dropped a hasty impression upon
one of these walls, and it is worth a visit
on its own .account. The rest of the room
is strewn with odds and ends, though I’ll
admit that’s no way to speak of some of
Hans I leysen’s best water-color gum trees.
The John Connell collection at the
National Gallery is splendid. It includes
furniture, pictures, china, silver and curios,
to the value, I am informed, of £lO,OOO.
Real tallboys, real gateleg tables and
delicious Sheraton and Ilepplewliite chairs,
and “dower-chests” (which in plain English
means glory boxes big enough to hold two
trousseaux and all the wedding presents),
.are arranged in alcoves fenced off with ropes.
Amongst the rest are two life-size oils by
Longstaff of the late Mrs. John Connell.
Squatter Alec Macleod’s widow died on
October 1. A daughter of Francis Ilenty,
of the great clan of Portland Hentvs, she
was a fine, gentle dame of the old school.
About a year ago she slipped and injured
her spine when boarding the family motor,
and has been an invalid ever since. The
Talisker estates, which came to her from her
husband, are worth a fortune, and they will
go to the two daughters, Line and Alexa.
These maidens have already inherited Ilenty
legacies, so they look like being swamped up
to their remarkably pretty necks in gold and
sheep and motor-cars. Line, who has a pale
resemblance to Lily Brayton and a Diana-
like dash about her, is promised matri-
monially, you will remember, to a Toorak
doctor. Alexa has just left off being a
flapper, and is a striking Burne-Jonesish
beauty who will do credit to any amount of
expensive upholstering.
Before catching the Sydney express, at
route for the Spring race meeting, Lady
Helen found time to visit three different
schools situated in three distinct suburbs.
Educationist F. Tate and a collection of his
colleagues showed her round. It is not so
simple as it looks; this vice-regalling. In-
deed a lot of it closely resembles hard work.
In Sydney the Fergusons were booked to
stay with that earnest britlier Scot, Colonel
Burns, at Cowan Brae. The Colonel goes
to bed at nine o’clock every night, and is
reputed to be one of the earliest risers in the
Parramatta district.
Dr. C. Grantham Anderson (known to
his intimates here as “G.G.”) volunteered
for service with the Royal Army Medical
Corps in London (he other day, and is under-
stood to be working at the present time in
a field hospital in France. lie went to Eng-
laud, originally, under the wing of surgeon
Hamilton Russell.
Exchange-Officer Major Marsh, who will
tread his native land with our first batch of
troops, saw his wife and offspring off by the
Otway. They are going to wait for him in
England, even though they be grey and old
before the Expeditionaries transpire. The
Major and his wife, like all people who
leave the country or die, are extremely
popular.
Mrs. Dick Casey has given her car to the
Allies, and young Dick proposes to operate
it. at the front. He is a lieutenaift in some
corps or other.
Lorna Nash, who came to Australia last
year with her cousin, Mrs. Claud MacDon-
ald. was married on Wednesday of last week.
Her ally was one Alastair Davies, whom she
met on the voyage in.
Mayoress Hennessy is extremely proud of
her patriotic efforts to clothe our departing
warriors. And well the energetic lady may
be. Her garnerings for the First Contingent
were stored in the huge supper room of the
I own Hall. The walls are very high in
this room, yet the piles of shirts touched the
ceiling. Also there were ’jamas, Balaclava
caps, mufflers and socles. Picture a roomful
of socks ! The imagination almost faints at
the vast conception.
Miss Greta Garnett, an 18-year-old sister
ot Mrs. Geoffrey Syme, who played about
Melbourne for a year or two, has had to
let her brand-new fiance go to the war. He
was sent off from Ireland so hurriedly that
he had no time to explain the position‘to his
distracted sweetheart in England.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The F. G. Scarfes had an exciting time on the
Moldavia. Ocean travelling seems to be rather like
living in a Zoo these times. Everyone comes along
to have a look at you—that is to say, everyone in
the battleship line. The Moldavia was inspected by
all sorts of French and British vessels. At Colombo
the passengers saw some of the Indian troops being
embarked for the field of blood.
Talking of those regions, by the way, Miss Ethel
Cooper, of this city, who has spent most of the last
10 years in Germany, was in Leipsig. when the war
broke out, and since then nothing has been heard
of her. She could not be more silent had she been
transformed into a paving-stone. Also, the Swifts
have a son their eldest—who is supposed to be in
Germany. lie, too, maintains a profound noise-
lessness.
Mr. Dutton’s estate has been sworn for probate at
.i-141,000. And he gave a lot to his only son in
his lifetime. The latter, by the way, left England
with his wife and two small sons early in Septem-
ber. The J. H. Gosses went by the same boat.
Miss Bessie Davidson, who had planned to “winter”
in Spain, was to leave here this week by thq, French
mailboat, and Mrs. J. R. Anderson was to go with
her. However, the war has killed the scheme for the
present.
The Hunt Club Races on Saturday last were hardly
what you could call a hilarious success. It was
blitheringly cold ; the going was as hard as nails ; and
the shadow of the Drought gibbered menacingly in
the background—a figurative expression, of course,
my dear. I am well aware that shadows do not
gibber. There were only a couple of starters in the
Maiden Hunters’ event. And the costumes were
mostly poor in quality and artistic merit. A lot
of them, in fact, were absolutely insolvent. Alto-
gether a dull and melancholy function.
Canon Andrews, for 60 years an Anglican cleric
and for 40 of them rector of St. Bartholomew’s,
Xor wood, is at last retiring. He was farewelled by
his parishioners on Friday night. He is a fine old
Word-expounder, of the downright sort —one who
has no time for the flummeries of Ritualism. His
opinion of Ritualism is so low that one requires a
diving-suit to get down to it. He is a sound preacher
and a poetry lover. Byron is his favorite—he can
quote him by the canto. His brother was one of
the State’s earlier Judges.
The water problem remains as insoluble as ever.
How to get fresh water without rain—that is the
puzzle which faces our city and suburban fathers,
and they are finding it a woodener.
The camp is to be moved to a new site. How it
came to be located in its present one is a mystery.
It is about a foot deep in dust everywhere, and as
the men are not training for action in the Sahara
the unpleasantness is felt to be pointless.
Two more frenzied objections to my re-
marks on men and things (the latter includ-
ing women) this week. I find most of these
complaints of inaccuracy to be paltry, as, for
example, when that excellent singer. Peter
Dawson, bemoaned the fact that I had
accused him of wearing silk socks when in
point of fact his foot-shields were of wool.
Anyhow, for the space of one calendar month,
from the date of issue, there are going to be
no more apologies, explanations or renig-
ments of any description from me. Ilow
saith the poet:—
The moving finger writes, and having writ,
Moves on, nor all your piety nor wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,
Nor all your tears wash out a word of it.
That is to say, not for another four or five
weeks at the least.
When the V.R.C. met at Flemington the
day was like a dream trimmed with blue and
gold and love songs. But, alas! most of the
nobility had fled to Randwick. The De
' ere Jumbucks were conspicuous by their
absence; the roving eye of the society para-
graphist failed to discern the Plantagenet-
W oolbales. The red plush seats of vice-
regality stood bare and neglected ; Governor
Stanley, the only trace of Pomp and Glory
to be found, was in the Stewards’ Pen. With
him I noticed Mrs. Dick Casey (in severe mole
and a hat that looked as if it had been
severely snubbed), Mrs. Herbert Power and
Mrs. Byron Moore. The last-listed wore
black and white feathers (one of each) above
dark winter clothes, as if the sunshine was a
mistake. Others in the Stanley group were
the Clive Leonards, squatter-folk who are
just back front London.
The meeting was about the shabbiest and
dowdiest on record. I counted dozens of
garments that did good service at the end of
last season ; and most of the parasols were of
the vintage of 1913. The only thing worth
looking at, and the one garment which was
talked to shreds by every right-minded
woman present, was an osprey the size of a
young tree which waved above the fail- fore-
head of our most daring dresser. The ver-
dict of the virtuous —or should I say undis-
covered V —poor was that it amounted to a
scandal for a woman to wear so much money
these times. I unearthed Mrs. Shepherd (wife
of Premier Fisher’s clever secretary) from
beneath a large top-dressing of ostrich-tail
ornaments. She was with someone who was
entirely concealed beneath a black hat and
a tartan sash.
Mrs. George Klug came with a sweet
smile, a soft floral velvet and ninon costume,
a small son and a large husband. Pretty
IMrs. Ada Fitzgerald was included in the
family, group, and Dr. O’Hara brought his
wife, in navy blue, and a white cloth
daughter. Small sailor hats, either of dead-
white or black, with waxed ribbon as trim-
ming. are the only spring millinery that
count. A few of the new capes were worn,
but the wearers lacked dash or swank, so the
would-be smart things wilted like moths that
had been out all night.
Ethel Goddard, the elocutionist, who
wedded one Orlo Smith some time ago, and
has since been honeymooning in Europe, is
back once more. Her husband imports' things
,and. he spent part of the wedding trip col-
lecting a number of agencies, which are no
doubt perfectly useless now.
Brunswick has built a Palais de Danse of
its own on Sydney-road, and has sent out
pasteboards for the opening operation on
October 8. The threepences collected on this
night are to swell the local Patriotic Fund,
and it is darkly hinted that members of
Parliament may be present.
The Victorian Club bade an affecting fare-
well at the Savoy the other night to
A. C. Colman, son of bookmaker John Col-
man. He has given his motor-car to the
Army, and will personally drive it at the
enemy if necessary. He is also prepared to
lay the enemy the current odds (33 to one)
about the Berlin-to-Paris event to any sum
Many members of the Club hold the view
that if the Germans could only be lured on
to gamble freely on this race they might be
ruined and the war brought, in consequence,
to a speedy termination.
The Church of England Men’s Society and
the Girls E riendly Society are going to be
let loose together at a garden fete in South
larra on October 17. Heaven knows what
will happen, as it is to be an afternoon
and evening affair, and you know what these
religious young fellows are. The proceeds,
if there are any, will go to assist the Patri-
otic Fund —that is, some of them will.
Professor Henry C. .T. Lingham lectures
on the ‘Religion of Beauty and the Renais-
sance of the Greek Ideal” in the Independent
Hall on Thursday, October 15, “with lovely
living models .” Clarence Weber will appear
in his famous leopard skin; Joseph Cook
will wear the silk hat (1910 style) and
frock suiting in which he conducted the
recent Federal campaign; and Id* Buller
will figure in the flowing garments of Old
Athens. There are rumors concerning the
possible appearance of other samples of
physical perfection—but the above, I am
assured, are certainties. The prices are to
h'- P 1) the “three, two and one” scale, and
half the cash goes to the usual bourne.
University professors, members of the
Amalgamated Society of Literati, Repertory
Theatre dramatists, and drinkers at the weil
of Pure English in general, keep' pestering
me as to why I write only of farewell din-
ners and Patriotic Fund jamborees these
days. The truth is there is nothing else to
write about. Society, in the old acceptation
oi the term, is a corpse. Everything is
branded with the fiery cross. You can have
a perfectly scrumptious time selling old
flowers to young men and flirting with every-
one else s husband, so long as the venture
wears the antiseptic sign. Without it your
revels, will, be voted heartless and anti-
imperial—if not frankly pro-German.
Our black brother David, the uplifted
aborigine, spent an instructive hour with
Governor Stanley the other afternoon. He is a
Christian, a man of culture and an inventor
—-in that order. He has invented all sorts
of things, but his masterpiece is a shearing-
machine. He belongs to the Merinderee
tribe and comes from Lake Alexandrina, and
his main object in life is to raise up his
black brethren from their present mental and
moral inkiness, so that they can all invent
shearing-machines and hair-curlers.
Private Secretary Wilberforce is the
latest vice-regality to bolt for the front. lie
waved a soldierly farewell to the Stanleys
last week from the deck of the Otway. The
war has caused an aide famine. These use-
ful creatures are now almost as difficult to
come by as sober cook-generals. In sheer
desperation Governor Stanley has been Help-
ing himself of late, like a deserted Mrs. Sub-
urbs whose Mary Anns keep giving notice.
A new aide was secured the other day, and he
is expected to prove a treasure —that is, if
he stays. He is Norman Hodges., a son of
Justice Hodges. Norman is shockingly good-
looking, with appealing brown eyes, and is
one of our most brilliant and intrepid Best
Men. He was usher or M.C. or Field-
Marshal or something at the Maggie Niall-
Burnham wedding. Need I say more?
Terang, in the Western District, is holding
a tennis tournament in aid of the lied Cross
Fund. So much for the mendacious carpers
who have at various times accused Terang
of a lack of Imperial Patriotism.
The Anglican Archbishop of Sydney says
that the recent visit of British Association
scientists was “an era in our spiritual his-
tory and the realisation of a dream that had
been almost past hope.” As a matter of
fact, it was a passing event which bumped
up against the war and was knocked out of
all semblance of importance. It seems like
a dream in Australia’s dim remembrance of
it. People who attended the social func-
tions prepared for the visitors got an un-
pleasant impression, for the German and
Austrian section of the scientists put on airs
of superiority and snorted at the possibility
of the Kaiser’s Culture Crusade proving a
failure.
Charles Godby, the new dean of
St. Paul’s, Melbourne, 1m 1 a long term at
St. George’s, Malvern, prior to his retire-
ment from parish-shepherding a few years
ago. St. George’s is in the same street as
State' Government House, and certain of
Victoria’s Anglican Governors, notably the
Talbottle and Sydenham Clarke, frequently
made the sacred building doubly blessed by
their presence. Like Christ Church
at South Yarra, St. George’s was one of the
few Anglican congregations to install a
billiard-table in an annex, and thus fight
the Devil in a scientific manner. Canon
Godby never took off his hat to a woman.
Instead he employed a gesture in the nature
of a military salute, and by the practice
caused many heart-searchings among the
uninitiated of his flock. Still, on his stout
salary, the canon was able to do as he
pleased with his hat; and the dean still does
it.
There is a fair quantity of expressive work
in the Vic. Artists’ sketch show at Eastern
Hill. William Fra ter exhibits an admirable
impression of a handsome lady, and W. B.
Mclnnes delicately handles light and color
problems in a bunch of very typical subjects.
His charming “Fresh Morning, Scotland,”
reveals an infinite capacity for early rising.
C. Leyshon White illustrates bits of Japan
and India in colors that won’t-be quiet, while
A. Colquhoun shows that he has been hunt-
ing up some of the landmarks of early Mid-
bourne with the fervor of a sentimental his-
torian. Miss Teague puts her name to
several efforts, and practically exhausts her
vigor on a portrait sketch of a military-
looking. gentleman. Ivan A. Rosenblum
drifts into bellowdrama and bathos in a
crude war allegory, “The Eternal Irony” ;
I. R. Crozier continues his dreams of green
trees and evening effects, and John Thallon
loses himself on a seashore crammed with
starved sea-birds and rocks that look like
almost anything else. Harrison’s “Valley of
the Goulburn” suggests a chromo-lithograph,
Leslie Wilkie’s contribution is a very full
description of a damsel’s back, the sketches
of Miss Bale, Miss Dora Wilson and Miss
Gumbrae Stewart are conscientious and
numerous, and there is something to he said
m favor of H. Paterson and A. ,T. Salmon,
the latter remembered for “A Spring Morn,”
which carefully holds the mirror up to Eng-
lish painter Clausen.
An exalted military gentleman in Mel-
bourne found himself beset by an untidy
young woman of about 25 in a suburban
street the other morning. “You’re D
uiu’t you? Well, Bill can’t go to the war.”
My good woman, I” “I tell yeh
straight, Bill can’t go to the war, an’ ’e
won’t, so there.. Bill’s engaged t’ me; then
he goes and enlists t’ fight the Germans.
V\ ell, he won’t go, see. He’s said he’ll
marry me, ’n’ he ain’t goin’ t’ get off so easy,
i give you my word.” Can’t you picture
Bill m a snow-filled trench, with a bullet in
his neck, getting off easy?
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
The Huntly colliery catastrophe has
disposed of a popular idea in Maoriland that
the mine was the safest in that country or
anywhere else. At the inquest Professor
Dixon, an English expert, stated that he had
tested six samples of coal-dust from the mine
and found it more inflammable than any he
had ever before handled. The Government
Inspector, who. had become aware of the
danger, had written to the manager, insist-
ing on something emphatic being done
promptly, and when nothing much was done
a prosecution was threatened. Apparently
the company went on doing nothing much,
and the Law did nothing at all. Only the
undertakers got really busy.

KIDNEY TROUBLE.
•SPLENDID RESULTS OBTAINED BY
TAKING DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT
PILLS.
“I have found Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills very effective for kidney troubles,”
writes Mrs. Frances Randall, of 16 Charles
Street, Queenborough, Sandy Bay, Hobart,
Tas. “I can say they proved the best of.
various remedies that I tried, and can con-
sequently give them great praise. You may
use this testimony if thought fit for the
benefit of other like sufferers.”
The above testimonial, written in a simple,
convincing manner, is only one among many
of those received from people who have de-
rived the greatest benefits from taking Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Many of these
people had tried other so-called remedies
until they had despaired of gaining any bene-
fit whatever. No other medicine, whether it
be pill or tablet, liquid or .solid, has ever
been so universally and successfully used by
all classes of the community, both rich and
poor. They are not advertised as a great
“Cure-All,” but as a safe, sure and reliable
remedy for the little ills of life, for which
they arc unexcelled.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
HIGH AND LOW LIBERALISM.
Mr. S. Manger lias threatened that unless Liberal-
ism accedes to the demands of his Victorian teetotal
friends something terrible will happen. —News item.
VETERAN ANTI-SOSH CANDIDATE: "I' ve
fought under many colors in me time —
Freetrader, Anti-Defence, Anti-Australian
and a few others; but, damme, sir, if I
swear allegiance to a Cold-Tea-and-Purity
Brigade!"
The Holman Government proposes to
develop the N.S.W. fisheries, if an experiment
is successful, by creating a fleet of about 50
trawlers. These boats can of course, be made
in N. S. Wales; yet Holman, apparently
because the Labor policy pledges him to buy
in Australia everything for Government use
that can possibly be made here, proposes to
import the first three from Britain. His
excuse is that he wants to start the business
at once, and that owing to the disorganisa-
tion of business in Britain he has a chance
of picking up the trawlers at bargain prices.
Business in N. S. Wales is also disorganised,
and the building of three trawlers would give
local men the bread they will be very hungry
for presently; but, apart from the Labor
pledge altogether, these small facts appear
to have no weight with Llolman. An alleged
bar-gain in a foreign shop is to that brilliant
failure what the whisky bottle is to the
dipsomaniac.
September 28 was the 90th anniversary of
the passing of the first Australian Act of
Parliament, or of Council, as it was termed.
Ir. was an Act to make bills payable in
Spanish dollars, the supply of British coin
being too small to go round.
War has its blessings as well as its hor-
rors. Picturesque Louvain has been reduced
by the Germans to a heap of cinders. The
cathedral of Elieims, where the Fr'urh kings
were crowned almost from the beginning of
things, is a ruin, and the wonderful old gate
which dates back to Augustus, the Roman,
is no more. Tournai, which was a metro-
polis 1490 years ago, has been wrecked by
the Prussian junkers. But it is recorded
that a swift-footed French soldier overtook
a fleeing German military band, and drove his
bayonet through the big drum. And when
he knocked seven devils out of the bit drum
he did something to square the account.
The war has now been clamoring on the
deck of things for two months, and all that
time the necessity for taking in sail was
visible to any politician who wasn’t utterly,
reckless or a lunatic. The N.S.W. Govern-
ment. being either utterly -reckless or a
lunatic, spent £50,320 more in August, 1914.
than it did in August, 1913. Then it got
a move on, and in September, 1914, it spent
£227,730 more than in September, 1913.
Also, it “blewed” £504,954 more loan money
in the July-September quarter of 1914 than
in the corresponding quarter of 1913. Inci-
dentally it spent its spare time shouting
about the need for economy.
“Black Swan”: The State election fight
in Westralia began, officially, on September
21, when Premier Scaddan spruiked at Ivan-
hoe. We were all a little anxious about the
State’s financial position, but it’s all right.
“Happy Jack” explained that the deficit
illustrated the prosperity of the country, just
as England’s national debt did. (Cheers.)
Also, he assured us that it was nonsense to
attach any importance to the Auditor-Gen-
eral’s figures, because everybody knew that
figures could be made to prove anything.
(Prolonged applause.) Several vei-y emi-
nent financiers in bis own party bad offered,
from the material before the 'Auditor-Gen-
eral. to produce a Large Surplus, (Tre-
mendous cheering.) Just to show what sort
of a nark the Auditor-General is I give you
his figures :—-
June, Revenue. Expenditure. Aggregate Balance.
1911.. £3,850,440 £3,734,448 Surplus £13,299
1912.. 3,916,673 4.101,082 Deficit 121,110
1913.. 4,516,650 4,787,063 „ 311,518
1914.. 5,205,343 5,340,754 „ 446,926
But “Happy Jack” still moves round in his
old breezy wav; he has since pushed the
deficit to £056,000, and is going strong.
Sydney Telegraph deplores
the wickedness of those who use
the war to “give an additional
turn to the fiscal screw.” The
reason, it seems, why Australia
has prospered so greatly is that
“20.000 workers here have been
able to turn out as much value
as 100,000 elsewhere,” and “the
products of the one can be freely
exchanged for the products of
the greater number elsewhere.”
Every thing in the Australian
garden is lovely, in fact —until
the time comes when guns are
handed out. Then the country
with the 20,000 millionaires will
begin to wish that it had a few
more thousand men, and hang
the prosperity ! The large fact
which the little Telegraph
hasn’t yet grasped is that the
wealth of a country isn’t always
in money. Sometimes it is in dungarees. A
whole sack of sovereigns couldn’t stop an
enemy at 1000 yards ; but a penniless man
with a pair of dungarees and a gun might
make a good attempt at it.
One of the first things that burst in Maori-
land when the war started was the kauri-
gum industry. It depended entirely upon
Foreign Consumer, Esq., and as that gentle-
man had gone to look for his neighbor with
an axe, he had ceased to be a consumer. So
the gum-digging industry just died. Premier
Massey is, however, arranging to resurrect it
by making advances against gum, which is
to be stored until someone at the other side
of the world knocks off lighting and starts
manufacturing again. Of course, the Maori-
lander might do some manufacturing on his
own account; but that means work. Who
wants work while the pubs and the pawn-
shops are open?
Last week the Liberal Government of
Victoria expressed its animosity to
Socialism by pushing forward the Public
Works Loan Application Bill. This pro-
vides, among other things, for the outlay
of a further £17,000 in Socialistic cool-stor-
age buildings and plant, and for advancing
another £lOO,OOO to closer settlers. The
rest of the opposition to Socialism was
shown in grants for Socialistic harbor im-
provements at Portland, Warrnambool, Port
Fairy and Geelong. The Governments which
hate Socialism seem, when you come to
think about it, perfect devils for dissembling
their feelings.
THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL AT
CANBERRA IN A DRY SEASON.
The Vic. State elections will happen in
November, and Queensland will tell Denham
what it thinks of him in February or there-
abouts. Labor hopes are high in both places.
In Victoria the results of the Federal elec-
tions are heartening; besides, pretty nearly
everybody is very tired of the tiredness of
the present Government. In Queensland
the fact that the Federal Labor vote in 25
State constituencies held by Denhamites
exceeded the Liberal vote is taken as an
indication that the banana there is quite
ripe.
One of the last official decisions of Irvine,
the Iceberg, in his capacity as Attorney-
General, was that cheques drawn on the
Commonwealth Bank don’t require the
penny stamp which is imposed on cheques
of other banks. The decision may be good
law or it may be bad law. But surely the
Commonwealth Bank doesn’t require to be
bolstered up by special exemptions, or privi-
leges, or indirect subsidies of this sort! It
is strong enough to stand on its own feet.
A curious letter entitled “The Waste of
Gambling” appeared the other day in S. M.
Herald. The writer pointed out that “the
last ‘consultation’ represented £25,000 in
hard cash, an amount that would keep 25,000
people in food for a fortnight.” But the
Tattersall’s consultation money remains in
the country, and is just as much available to
buy food for 25,000 people after the Mel-
bourne Cup sweep has been drawn as it was
before. It may have passed from one Aus-
tralian to another, but the coin is still here.
It is the £25,000 which goes permanently
out of the country to pay for imported cloth-
ing and lioofgear and machinery and other
things which prevents 25,000 people having-
two weeks’ victuals. Gambling may be a
poor sort of jest, nut it is a blessing by com-
parison with Freetrade, Low-Tariffism and
importing.
Premier Scaddan, of Westralia, is a man
of might, like Tubal Cain, who hammered
brass and iron in the days when the world
was young. He proposes, by reason of the
war, to reduce the maximum price of public
land to 15s. per acre, and to make the reduc-
tion retrospective, so that the man who has
already bought at £1 per acre will have ss.
knocked off his purchase money. Also he
proposes that the time allowed for payment
shall be extended from 20 to 30 years.
Scaddan is the most insensate borrower and
spender and manufacturer of deficits that
Westralia has possessed. Now that the
loans are cut very short his idea for meeting
the crisis is to sacrifice a heap of the land
revenue, and . thereby make things worse.
Yet with war prices prevailing in Europe
this should be a time when the “great natu-
ral resources of the country,” for the develop-
ment of which so many borrowed millions
have been spent, could carry a little extra
burden instead of wanting relief on a large
scale.
Australian railway
men are cursing the
recent borrowing boom
with a curse so robust
that you could shift a
bogged wool-waggon
with it. These rail-
way bosses would have
the hottest time of
their life even if there
hadn’t been the orgy ;
for, besides suffering
the ordinary ill-effects
of the war, they have
to do a heap of jobs
for the military forces
for nothing, and they
are up against
the most widespread
drought for 21 years.
But on top of all that
—on top of the job of
shifting thousands of
truck-loads of starving
stock for 7s. fid. in the
£ (ordinary rate), and
doing hundreds of sim-
ilar unprofitanle jobs
—the borrowing boom
has landed them with
heavy charges on new
lines which are opened
only as far as No-
where, and haven’t had
time to develop enough
traffic to pay for the
guard’s whistle. Un-
less a miracle inter-
venes, something hard
is going to hit the rail-
way servants of more
than one State, and
when it happens it is
to be hoped that the
right proportion of
bricks will be aimed at
the curse of Cohen.
Meantime, the most
deplorable feature of
the business is that the
Governments can’t think of any other cure
for the headache but to turn up at the sign
of the Three Balls and lap up some more of
the old poison.
The final result of the Senate poll in N.
S. Wales left Laborites Gardiner, MeDougall
and Grant in the first three places. Gould
and Millen (Liberals) were fourth and fifth,
and David Watson (Labor) defeated Oakes
(Liberal) by 5000 for sixth place. In
ordinary course th: first three will hold
their seats for six years, while the second
three will have to go up foi re-election in
1917. MeDougall and Grant therefore
scored a bit by pushing back Earle Her-
mann’s business friend and colleague into
fourth i lace.
Conroy of the Yap has lost Werriwa by
seven votes in a poll of 20,000. He was a
bitter public opponent of the compulsory
training system, the compulsory vaccination
idea and other necessary precautions for the
safety of the nation —things which he and
the I.WjW. and the Peace Society and other
cranks allege interfere with the liberty of
the subject, but which, in cold, hard-boiled
fact, make the liberty of the subject pos-
sible. An appeal to public horse-sense sit
the present time is a chilly job if you have
an objection to compulsory military defence
rooted on your premises.
BUILDING THE PERMANENT WALL.
At the present time Australia has the largest
possible measure of natural protection, in the form
of absolute cessation of imports from practically all
its possible competitors. —Sydney Telegraph.
AUST.: " But there's still a chance that the
war won't last for all eternity."
“FORGIVE!"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Rain is falling about tbe Murray. —News item.
We overstocked the country, and we ate the saltbush
out;
All down the Lachlan side we shut our eyes to
drought ; -b
We let the rivers run to sea between the bone-dry
plains,
And we never locked a stream that we might save
the bounteous rains.
Now that the rootless plain in willy-willies whirls
around ;
Now that the land is haggard, wan and baked, and
dry the ground,
Forgive us! we who took of all and held it like a
miser,
And send us rain unto the plain that we may beat
the Kaiser.
For bad as any madman’s war to us is deepest
drought—■
To us who overstocked the plains and ate the saltbush
out.
Forgive us, then, who took of all, and held it like a
miser,
And send us rain unto the plain that we may kill
the Kaiser.
Our soldiers and our sailors by meat and wheat are
fed ;
And if they're not, their bolt is shot and they are
quickly sped.
So send us rain that bread may grow and sheep and
cattle fatten,
That death come to the Kaiser crow-, w-ho on the
herds would batten;
That good Australian meat and wheat may cross the
seas in plenty,
To fill the soldiers’ bellies and give each the strength
of twenty.
Forgive us! we who took of all, and mean were as
the miser,
And send us rain unto the plain that we may kill
the Kaiser.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
“O’Cork” : Last Saturday's Epsom mile at
Randvvick was won by Portrush, as foretold in a par.
when over three score mokes were still left in. The
Newcastle stable mates, Portrush and Woolerina, were
selected to supply the winner, with preference for the
stable-elect on the day. All the 23 final acceptors
Went to the barrier, with the press-boomed Royal
Laddie heading the market, at threes. Then at seven
tO one came the big black Gigandra, top weight with
list,. l()lb. “Gig” is a six-furlong champion, but
lmd failed at a mile until quite recently, though he
had humped big loads into second place in one Epson!
and one Doncaster. Ratlilea and First Principle, the
latter the winner of the A.. 1.0. Doncaster last April,
figured at 10’s. Portrush fluctuated from 25’s to
12’s, and went out at 16’s, and, in some places, 20’s.
Stable and Newcastle coin kept him always shorter
than his stable mate Woolerina, who went out at
33’s and 40’s. When fairly going Aurifer and Port-
rush led the mob right round to the distance, where
Embracer, First Principle and Gigandra joined in.
When a dead-heat looked certain the little New-
castle jockey, J. Quigley, bade the cracks, Connell,
Wood and Lillyman, “So-long!” and shot Portrush
out to win by two lengths from the three-year-old
Garlin, who beat Gigandra by a length. And Garlin
was a 50-to-one shot, be it remembered, which means
12 to 1 for a place. Worthy of notice that Aurifer,
who last year ran third in both Epsom and Metrop.
prior to winning the Caulfield Cup, this time put
up a very promising fourth —whether with a view to
Monday’s Metrop. or the Caulfield or Melbourne Cups
no man might tell—or, at least, only a very select
few. Portrush, a cast-off of Sam Hordern’s," is a four-
year-old bay by the imported -PetHTlo from Irish
Corner, the latter being to the retired
crack Poseidon Portrush is an
Irish place name ; is' dot owned, as
alleged in sundry "'oaiii.es,' by Newcastle trainer J.
Chambers, bijt, with Woolerina, is leased from R. W.
Clancy, who 'lias raced some good junipers in recent
years. The inephew of Poseidon cut out the mile
in lmin. 37fsec., equal to the Australian record
established at Randwick in April, 1909. But Mont-
calrii humped 9st. 31b. as against Portrush’s 7st. 41b.
Nineteen of the 33 Epsom starters were, not engaged
in the Metropolitan, and the place-getters were among
the 19 ; which gave plenty of opportunity for an
Epsom failure to once more score in the mile and
a half race.
Eleven went out for the Derby, and of these the
public selected Wcorak to carry the bulk of its
swag; whereon Moses - Shortodds at once reduced
the price to five to four on, and on these preposterous
terms the gee-gee was well loaded. Others who re-
ceived some attention were ltavello at fives, and
Mountain Knight at sevens. Carlita and Giru went
out well supported at eights and tens. After Carlita
and Tawdrv had misbehaved themselves at the start-
ing post, Woorak went to the front and showed a
great desire to go right through at top speed. Had
he been allowed to do so the result might have been
different. For a mile he battled to get his head;
then Mountain Knight drew alongside, and stayed
there till Woorak entered the straight. At this
point Mountain KnigTif opened out, and after a
determined struggle got to the-front and landed the
bacon by three parts of a length, with Giru third.
It was a sad sight for the punters, but the jubilation
in the camp of Israel Mac Patrick was positively
indecent.
Mclsrael O’Shortodds did not do nearly so well
the second day of the meeting. The favorite got
home in The Shorts (Gigandra, at twos), in the
Olibborn Memorial Stakes (Giru, at twos), and in
the Breeders’ Plate (Del Monte, at five to two). In
the Metropolitan the public made a favorite of St.
Carwyne, the chestnut son of St. Alwyne, by Carwee,
and Mclsrael quoted him at nine to two against.
He evidently feared the impossibly-named Psyttyx,
and laid only 11 to two against the brute. . Posinatus
was another dreaded visitor, feared up to sevens.
With St. Spasa the man with the pencil was inclined
to be reckless, not to say frivolous, and freely offered
eights. The demand was mild till just on closing
time; when a commission was worked off in masterly
style, and a huge swag loaded on to the son of
St. Amant at anything between eights apd tens.
At the five-furlong- post St. Spasa was leading the
main army, with sundry others acting as a screen in
the vanguard. At the half-mile-post St. Spasa had
closed on the leaders, and was coming verv fast, and
rounding the bend he went to the front with a beauti-
ful, effortless motion, running as smoothly as a clock.
He turned for home with Moonbria and Miss Mooltan
right on his heels, but rolling heavily in the rough
pace. At the distance he was clear, and still running
smoothly, and, like Iser. rapidly. At the half-
distance Psyttyx came with a burst of speed with
the favorite close behind. Then St. Spasa put
his head down and bis heels up, and when the bout
was over was still in front with a neck to spare, the
favorite being third, half a length away. It was a
fine race.

A punter with a craving for fancy wagers
co«ld : easily be tempted to take odds that the
winners of Caulfield and Melbourne Cups ran in the
October Stakes at Flemirigton last Saturday. Ale-
conner, Anna Carlovna and Sylvanmore, the placed
horses, with lownit and Eubulus, who also started,
are a dangerous quintet of Victorian goers for the
big betting races. The time (2min. 6isec.) was
excellent for 10 furlongs, on the V.R.C. course, but
the lace was unsatisfactory as regards “plunger”
Connolly’s brown mare. Anna Carlovna, starting at
6 to 4 against, after being backed by the hopeful
public at evens, and odds on (the h.p. never tires of
backing Connolly’s mostly unsuccessful favorites),
jumped away in front from the barrier, then
retired rapidly into ninth position, and finally
came at Aleconner when the latter was winning. On
this result the Malster horse should beat the mare
next Saturday week. But at this time last year it
was stated that Anna never ran her best races when
she was steadied at the outset; therefore her per-
formance last Saturday was possibly not one of her
best. All the same, Aleconner did mighty well in
heating at the weights, for in the Caulfield Cup lie
meets her on 71b. better terms. Sylvanmore, a slow
beginner, was running on at the finish, and if this
fine gee can really stay two miles, as is alleged, he
must be a very promising' proposition for the Mel-
bourne Cup.
Other talked-of nags that ran at Flemington iast
Saturday were Eltharn (nowhere in the Stand Handi-
cap) and Creek Fire, nowhere in a six-furlong flutter,
won by the trusty Colden Wire.
The Maribyrnong Trial Stakes, the first 2-year-old
competition of , the seas,on, was full of incident for
punters. In the race the favorite, Two, shied and
lost ground when he looked pretty sure to win.
After the, second favorite, Pretty Bobby, had got
home, and" whilst the books were paying out, the
winner was disqualified for carrying 2 jdb. over-
weight. The yarn goes that L. Fisher was not too
heavy when lie weighed out, but subsequently lie
took a dose of beef extract for a pick-me-up. He
bad wasted a lot to ride Ihe colt, and the liquid
fattened him right away. What an advt. for bull!
I (minor's poor running in the Spring
Stakes at Randwick last Saturday is not to be taken
as a reflection on his Melbourne Cup chance. Rad-
nor, fit and well, will be an undeniably dangerous
one next month, like Grey Spear, who ran unplaced
in the Trial Stakes. But it certainly looks as if
the somewhat sanguine Sol Green had over-rated the
galloping powers of Ravello, Hie Derby and Cup colt.
Ravello, by Positano from The Parisian’s dam, was
tipped to do great things this season. In the A.J.O.
Derby he showed no reason for being backed down
to 5 to 1.
Adelaide Hunt Club races claim to be the
oldest continuous meeting of S.A., having kept their
end up when —during a racing slump—tiie “Adelaide
Onp” was actually run in Melbourne. The Hunt Cup
this year went to old Kappakoola, who paid £ll Is.
in a field of seven. Other useful dividends of the
day were £lO, £24 ss. and £56 75., and in the
last case there was a consolation of 24 bob for every
sovereign invested on the favorite, which ran second.
London Referee throws mud at the dead:
Albert 1 rott had broken down so hopelessly that
even if ho had not sought the relief of a pistol-shot!
he could scarcely have lasted much longer. A truly
great cricketer, he had no enemy but himself One
is always reluctant to speak harshly about a man
who is dead, but there are occasions when no good
purpose is served by trying to bide the truth.
Everyone behind the scenes knows that Trott ought to
have had a longer career. His best days were over
before lie was 30.” As a cricketer the Referee gives
him a great character: “He was a special favorite at
Ford s almost as soon as he began to play there.
No other bowler has been quite like him.” The
( usually well-informed) writer has “never understood
vr . was no . £ s ' iv . en a Place in the Australian
a! n ~ ’ which his brother Harry was captain.
At the time that side was chosen he was beyond
i question, the most remarkable all-round player among
I Australia s young men. ’ This is, of course, ridi-
culous, otherwise Australia must have been mad, not
to select him. The plain fact is that Albert Trott,
aftei a. brilliant first season in 1894-5, had a very poor
one in 1895-6, and simply couldn't he picked So
he went to England on his own, and there played
better than ever.
The Indian motqr-cycle people are
protesting that when J. Booth, of Vic., scored a new
lecoi d on their fast and furious machine by whizzing
a mile in 51 sec., he did not “make a splendid effort
against the undertaker” even in a Bulletin way of
speaking. In short, it is claimed for the Indian
that u never goes wrong, and, therefore, never ■
lands its riskiest rider in the arms of the undertaker.
But what the quality of the vehicle has to do with
the chances of a record-breaker striking* a snag or a
runaway horse this paper cannot imagine. The under-
taker has so many ways of getting at a man who
rides at the rate of 70J miles an hour, without cast-
ing the least aspersion on the motor-cycle he bestrides.

of France at this particular moment. Piercev and
Keefe, the other two members of the teafn, went
across to the 11.5. A. to take part in track racing
there. Although the team did not set the Seine on
fire, they did sufficiently well to earn great praise
from both French and British riders and press, and
the Gladiator Co., whose machines they rode, was
so well satisfied that it wanted them to sign on for
another season. But Kaiser Bill upset all these
arrangements, and the Lord only knows what will be
happening next season.

The English Automobile Association
offered to raise a corps of 10,000 motorists and cars
for service in France and Belgium. The Great Scrap
will push itself in. The extraordinary speed of the
advance of the German right wing was due to the
use of motor transport. And the failure of the
advancing Germans to compel the British and French
to give decisive battle was due to the fact that the
latter’s splendid motor equipment -enabled them to
get right away, and re-form and fight on ground of
their own choosing, where the German had to throw
away 20 valuable lives to drive one of the Allies
out of his position. The Automobile Association
believes that a corps of 10,000 skilled motorists, in
properly-armored cars fitted with machine-guns, would
be a veritable hornet, liable to upset any calcula-
tions. So far, the armored motor-car has not played
anything like the decisive part it was expected to
in the actual fighting. It was dreamed that small
squadrons of such cars would hold up whole batta-
lions, and sweep away whole companies with machine-
gun and magazine-rifle fire. But so far they have
not done so.
MEHEGAN AND DE FONIHIEU AT
SYDNEY STADIUM.
“Now, where's that Frenchman got to?”
Cabled that there is no shortage of petrol
in England, but there is a dearth of tins. All the
big companies advertise asking motorists to imme-
diately return “empties.” In some'cases petrol can
be obtained only by taking round a receptacle in
which to carry the stuff away. A hideous circum-
stance, by which the best in the land have been
turned into mere collectors of “dead marines.”
The Dane made a brave attempt to run
through the World's Championship Cycling events in
early August, in spite of the war. But after the
long-distance events, were concluded it was apparent
that the meeting was, a failure, and the classic
affair was abandoned before the various sprint cham-
pionships were contested.
Sydney First-Grade cricketers took the
field last Saturday afternoon, but, with the excep-
tion of those of Gordon, University and Balmain, the
batsmen did not make a brilliant start. The wickets
were all deadly slow, and some of them were moist,
and the bowlers had a good time. For a start, the
premier team, University, put it all over Waverley
by smacking 243 and then smashing five Waverley
wickets for 40. Of these Minnett took three for 19.
North Sydney dismissed. Petersham for 97, and then
made only a miserable 63 itself, and when the weary
sun went down six more Petersham sticks had fallen
for 22. With a team including some promoted
juniors Balmain smote the bowling of Sydney for
315, and made the boss score of the day. In spite
of the fact that Trumper whaled up 123 with his
own bat for Gordon, that team put together only
269 against Glebe. yVnother sad business was the
scramble between Paddington and Western Subui’hs,
Pad. falling for 82. The chief destroyers were Dive
and Docker, who respectively took five and three
wickets for 23. However, when West
got to the sticks it did very little
better, and promptly lost five wickets
for 68. Redfern struck a snag in
Central Cumberland, and went over-
board for 83, and the tail of Parra-
matta was exalted mightily. But its
elation died when it got to the wickets,
where hut for the 79 of Cranney it
would have cut a shocking figure.
Three of its, batsmen failed to score,
and besides Cranney only' one man
succeeded in reaching double figures;
nut that 79 saved the situation, and
the innings closed for 130. Cranney
is a good man to have about a team.

A fine billiard break was made
in Wellington (M.U.) by J. E. Henrys,
the _ well-known M.L. liandicapper.
Playing at the Commercial Travellers’
Club a game of a thousand up, he
made an all-round run of 214—a M.L.
record for an amateur on a standard
table.
The final meeting in connection with the
Balmain Annual Regatta has been held, and the
bones of the old function have, so to speak, been
decently interred. The regatta dates back many
decades, but interest in it has steadily waned until
last year the old fixture fell through. Times have
changed, and regattas, like prophets, are not what
they were. The small balance to the credit of the
committee has been paid over to the Patriotic Fund,
and the Harry Rawson Cup.—the centrepiece of the
competitions—has been handed to a local skiff club's
list of prizes. The swell relation of the Balmain
affair, the Anniversary Regatta, has also come upon
evil times, and only sentiment and boiling enthusiasm
among a few keep it going.
Soccer football still lingers superfluous on
Sydney s summer stage. On Saturday Granville, the
victorious premier club, beat a. Metropolitan team
by one goal to nil. West Wallsend also fell on
Auburn District, and routed it by three goals to one
—a very decisive doing in Soccer.
There were 24 starters for the big Grand
prix (N.S.W.) motor-cycle race, held over the
V etholme-Sunny Corner course on Monday. The
first home was E. Meller, on a 2f h.p. Douglas, with D.
McFarlane, riding a 5 h.p. Matchless, second. The
little Douglas covered the 140 miles in 3 hours
21min. 48sec., and beat the higher-powered machines
badly. The Sydney-Yetholme teams’ trial was won
by the N.S.W. Motor-Cycle Club’s team (two Mel-
lers and Hargreaves). The Mellers rode 2f h.p. Doug-
lases, .so it was a day out for the light machines.-
The Lang-Storbeck scrap at the Sydney
Sports Ground on Monday was an unsatisfactory affair.
Storbeck was youthful and vigorous, but unskilful
and obviously inexperienced. His youthful vigor
was, however, too much for Lang’s ring-generalship,
and for 18 weary rounds he piled up points galore.
Even when Lang’s straight left jolted his head right
back, he managed to send home counters which
kept Lang’s pile of points stationary. In the 18th
lie suddenly found himself standing on all-fours on
the floor, and, while ho was there, Lang, apparently
blind with eagerness, rushed in and smote him on
his dome of thought, and was instantly disqualified
by referee Arthur Scott. This ..is about the third
time Lang has made the same curious blunder, and
apparently he can’t help it. Perhaps he thought
he was in the trenches in North-east France.
The newly-created N.S.W. lieavy-boat
championship attracted only four entrants ; which is
not a healthv start for the title and the brand-new
trophy presented by Mr.' Percy Marks. However, the
race will go on, and the winner will be found among
H. Pickering, Ben Thorougligood, Sydney and Arthur
Pearce. The event takes place on Middle Harbor on
October 24, and will include a sweepstake of- £5.

When the Australian Board of Control
reaches its annual meeting it is to be hoped it will
not swallow its decision to demand guarantees from
overseas bodies who promote Australian cricketing
tours. Hitherto the Board has stood all the losses
made by English teams in Australia. Now, Maryle-
bone Club has just as much money as the 'Board, and
reciprocity is badly needed.
N.S.W.’s inter-State cricket programme
will comprise return matches against Victoria, South
Aus. and Queensland. Tasmania will be accommo-
dated at Hobart on March 19, just before the shutters
go up for the season, and the “colts'” matches will
provide further diversion. The Ma State’s Associa-
tion dropped over £5OO on last year’s proceedings,
and is looking forward to the new season with more
than usual apprehension.
Generally understood that Mclsrael
O’Shortodds had the worst of the betting* argument
in the three Sydney suburban meetings prior to the
A.J.O. carnival which commenced last Saturday. But
the dropping out ot' favorite prads in the impending-
big handicaps must have made a big hole in his
alleged losses. Beragoon, a well-backed favorite at
long odds for the Metrop. fell out of the event, and
next day Multifoil, an earlier favorite at longer odds,
also collapsed. In both cases the fall of the brute
meant that the public lost the cash it had thrown
into the bag*. These windfalls must put an enormous
profit into the pockets of the “books,” and, until
a wise Government arises with a Totalisator Bill and
an axe, will enable the layers of odds to array them-
selves in fine linen and keep as many wives as Solo-
mon in all his glory.
The crowd of French boxers at present in
Australia are evidently of a much better stock than,
the first lot who visited these shores. Nobody could
have fought with greater courage than De Ponthieu
did against Mehegan at the Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day night, nor more vigorously than “Knock-out”
Marchand did with Darcy on Monday. The first
scrap went the full 20 rounds; the plucky
little Frenchman got a terrific hammering, but saw
it through and fought a losing battle in a manner
any Briton might be proud of. Mehegan was in
splendid form, and he served out mule kicks instead
of blows. Never has the Stadium seen him hit so
hard; yet the gallant Gaul, instead of standing off
and boxing, went in and fought him —a thing which
Mehegan dearly loves. Twice it looked as though
the Australian would get him, but he managed to
dance away and take the death-dealers while in re-
treat. His skill was greater than that of the Aus-
tralian, but he lacked the power to make it effective,
although many times his counters sent Hughie stag-
gering. It was on his part a long and desperate
struggle against superior force; the ringsider always
had a feeling that, although Mehegan might knock
out the Frenchman with a single blow, there was
practically no chance of the plucky little De Ponthieu
scoring a sudden finish. Hughie had the advantage
of a much longer reach. Lurching forward, he would
drive a piston-like left and then swing over a right
like a club; moreover, he seemed to have suddenly
acquired a fiendish ability to follow up and rapidly
repeat this ugly evolution. Advantage of reach is
a terrible thing when the man who lias it knows how
to make use of it, and on Saturday night Hughie’s
ability in this direction amounted to genius. At the
end of the long, ferocious battering* Harald Baker
placed his hand on Mehegan’s head; and while the *
crowd gave the fairest and most popular fighter in ;
Australia full acknowledgment of his victory, the
cheers for his pluckv, clever victim were just as j
rousing, and everybody was glad little De Ponthieu
had escaped a knock-out.
Monday night’s fight, despite the distrac-
tions of rival entertainments, drew a full house,
though nobody was uncomfortably packed. In
this case it was the Australian who had to avoid
the ever imminent knock—and succeeded in doing it.
From the moment the fight started it was obvious
how the Frenchman had gained his pseudonym. His
method is to disregard punishment and work him-
self into a position to properly swing his gigantic
shoulders, and then —well, if that giant swing gets
home the rest is silence, unless the head of the
stricken boxer falls on an iron roof outside the
enclosure. „ The improvement in Darcy’s boxing is
almost beyond belief. Never has a scrapper im-
proved faster than Darcy since he first entered the
ring against Fritz Holland ; and while acquiring skill
he_ has not lost any of that rugged strength and
ability to take punishment that distinguished him in
the beginning. But on Monday night he was up
against a most dangerous proposition that tested all
his skill and ruggedness. Marchand charged in like
a bull, disregarding punishment, and hurled blows
like those flung round by the lions of King-Francis.
But. Darcy- did not back away. He rushed to. meet
his virile opponent, and strove to send his blows
wild by bashing him on the nose with a straight
left, and to kill him stone dead by wnirling in a
right that would have staggered an elephant or
dazed a brick wall. As he came in he ducked,
smashed and clinched. Not that there was any
safety in clinching with this wild tiger, who
wrenched himself free and swung rigat and left like
the swinging of an electric armature. Darcy had
to duck and dodge when fighting at any range, and
he had to duck and dodge harder and quicker than
ever when they got to close quarters. Once, in
the second, the Frenchman got him right where the
neck joins the shoulder and nearly knocked him
down, and before he could move the Gallic left had
whirled round and caught him on the side, of the
head above and behind the ear. Darcy had to hang
on for a second, when the gong brought respite.
Had it occurred in the beginning of the round Darcy
might have gone right out.
The fight was terrific in its savage vigor and wild
energy and tremendous hitting. It was impossible
such a tornado could last 20 rounds, and the end
came in the fifth, when, after a'wild rally, Marchand
rushed in and Darcy met him with a terrific right
swing to the body. For the first time the face of
Marchand expressed pain ; nevertheless, he swung two
wild wallops which Darcy just managed to evade, and
before the Gaul could recover himself Darcy landed
a terrific uppercut, followed up with a left and
right to the head. Marchand charged again. Darcy
side-stepped, and, as the Frenchman turned round
to come once more, Darcy met him with the two
most harmless-looking blows struck in the scrap —a
short left hook and an apparently mild upper-cut.
But it was their landing-place that counted —right
on the point of the chin ! Marchand fell like a log,
rolled over, hauled himself up by the ropes, fell
down again, turned a complete somersault, rose once
more and again fell prone. After lie was counted
out his seconds di'agged him to his corner, poured
water ovei; him as he gasped on his seat, and then he
suddenly fell off his seat and reclined on the floor
against the ropes. It was a most amazing perform-
ance, and all the world wondered whether he was
acting or was in genuine agony.

“Colonel Puff” : This spy-hunting fever is
terrible. A week or so ago an artist and
two friends wandered into a military camp
which was more or less involved with a
sporting fixture. The artist had a black
leather portfolio under his arm, and, in the
course of his unauthorised wanderings, led
the two unsuspecting friends into a large
shed. It was a breathlessly uninteresting
place full of old military clothes and dusty
boots—the sort of place a wandering hen
would have scorned to prospect. The party
decided to get out. But at the door was an
officer. He had arrived on horseback —pro-
bably at full gallop —and, when he saw the
artist’s portfolio his face became very stern.
“What were you doing in there?” he thun-
dered. The issuing party came to a dead
stop and looked guilty. They had been
doing nothing, and they knew the officer
knew they had been doing nothing, because
there was really nothing to do inside the
barn. But at the same time they were aware
that the military mind is intensely sus-
picious and that when camp-wandering it is
always advisable to defer to a person in
uniform. “I’m an artist,” chirped the man
with the suspicious portfolio, and stood wait-
ing for the avalanche. It didn’t arrive. The
man on the horse looked searchingly at the
portfolio to make certain that it did not
bear the damning label “SPY,” and quite
suddenly and without a word of warning
urged his bored horse in the other direction.
I understand military life is full of thrills
like that.

“B.” : The cutting of the cable at Fanning
Island has been treated as a very minor
war incident, but its Australian interest is
considerable. The island was, until lately,
wholly in the hands of private individuals.
Nearly 50 years ago William Greig obtained
a deed of conveyance of the spot from the
British authorities and settled there. He
dealt mostly with the American markets, but
sometimes with Sydney. Copra and guano
were the chief exports. He once had a part-
ner named George Bicknell. and. during the
partnership, the Pacific Cable Co. leased
part of the island as a cable station on the
All Red route. Greig and Bicknell duly
died, and the island, after some squabbling,
was put up for sale. But previously a Ger-
man syndicate was formed to buy the rights
of .Greig and Bicknell. The Australian Gov-
ernment, identified with the All Red route,
showed uneasiness at this stage, and the
British Government cast about for a way to
forestall the proposed foreign purchasers.
Under directions the Fiji Government “re-
sumed” the land on which the cable property
stood. When an auction came on, Father
Emanuel Rougier, a local priest, bought
the remainder of the island for, it
was thought, ecclesiastical purposes. It
transpired later that he acted as agent
for Humphrey Berkeley, a trader of
Fiji. Berkeley, who. toured. Australia
lately, launched the Fanning Island
Company with a view to developing phos-
phates, and. when in Sydney, was enthusi-
astic over the project. It transpires that
Bicknell. who was supposed to have died
without issue, has a son. and Greig has also
left representatives who are threatening
legal interference with existing arrange-
ments. The United States has also asserted
sovereignty over rhe island, and in 1912 sent
a cruiser to hoist the Stars and Stripes, but
the mailer was reduced to negotiations with
a view to arbitration. The present writer
lately received a letter from one of the
Greigs. in Scotland, asking assistance to
unravel the tangle of Fanning Island inter
ests, and declaring himself a legal heir.
“Gazeeka.” : Maoriland Government, subsi-
dises donations to hospitals at the rate of
245. in the £, and the system is often abused
by business sharks with the assistance of
hospital committees. The writer was in a
country newspaper office the other day,
when the secretary of the hospital ball com-
mittee came in to see about some advertis-
ing. The manager estimated the cost of the
advertisement at £1 10s., and made a rather
cute arrangement with the secretary. The
newspaper donated £1 10s. to the ball com-
mittee, and this, with the Government sub-
sidy added, made a total of £0 6s. The bill
for advertising was made out at £3, so that
the newspaper received £1 10s. for its adver-
tising and got its donation back, while the
ball committee got its advertising ' for
nothing and made a profit of 6s. on the deal.
AUNT TILUA'S INSTRUCTIONS TO WILLIE .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The tiine appears to be approaching when there will
be another opportunity for placing colonial loans on
the London market. We anticipated that such a time
would recur early in the new year, but it would now
seem probable that that date may be anticipated, and
that Mr. Holman may be able once more to draw upon
London for supplies of capital. If so, it will be an
advantage, because in many ways the threatened
advance in rates for money here would be a serious
dra wba ck. — ~Snd:i e.y T e leg kapu .

The first requirement of a modern nation is con-
tinuity of employment, That is, of course, profitable
employment. The artisan requires continuity of pro-
fitable use of his muscles and intelligence and skill.
The capitalist requires continuous use of his plant
jUid a constant return on his capital. What is
Andrew Fisher going to do about it? Although all
Europe is weltering in war the Australian citizen
will require just as many meals as be did before.
Also, it will take the same quantity of trousers to
prevent him being-run in under the .Act. He cannot
well do without a boot on each foot, even though the
German bombards London or Marseilles.
If every Australian citizen gets all the things that
are really necessary to a decent and wholesome life,
and gets them from Australian factories, there will
be a boom of prosperity in Australia though Europe
should be 'consumed in a blaze of war and
anarchy. The newly-elected Labor Government has
a splendid opportunity. The shattered industry of
Europe throws Australia on its own resources to an
unusual extent, unless it proposes to buy more goods
from the United States at any price the United States
likes to ask. So this is the time to create Australian
industries, say the daily papers 1 Which is true.
But industries do not spring up in a night, like
Jonah’s brolly. They have to be organised, and
plant has to be laid down at the cost of much money
and brain sweat. The war may end next week. It
is more likely to end six months hence, just about
the time the enterprising Australian manufacturer
has acquired his plant, got his staff engaged, and has
buried his money in his factory and supply of raw
material. And then Austria and Germany, beaten to
their knees, saddled with a vast indemnity, working
with boy, girl and Woman labor, will be the cheapest
nations on earth and the places where the longest
hours are worked. Against the surplus these defeated
peoples must export to raise their indemnities no
Australian manufacturer, paying decent Australian
wages, and working 48 hours (or 44 hours) per week,
will have a ghost of a chance.
So before the Australian capitalist ventures to sink
money in a factory, plant, trained staff and supplies
of raw material, he will require an assurance from
Andrew Fisher that the Australian market will be
kept clear of the cheap-labor, long-hour products of
the beaten Austro-German manufacturers.
There i's only one way that Andrew Flsiier can
give that assurance, and that is by erecting an iron-
clad Protective wall right round the continent.
Duties such Us 3'Si per cent, ad val. will be useless
against the desperate industrial conditions of im-
poverished countries. Nothing less than specific
duties ranging up to 80 and lot) per cent, will be of
the least use.
This is the greatest war of history, and the dis-
aster and slump that Will follow in its train will
be colossal. It is possible that tile results
over a large area will amount to a temporary
suicide of civilisation. That is to say that the
industrial conditions will be so hideous as to amount
to about the most grinding form of slavery yet
invented.
Having assured the Australian market to the Aus-
tralian manufacturer, the work of organisation will
have to be taken in hand by the various Governments.
Experts must be obtained, a Bureau of Information
established, and an Industrial Bank created. The
work of an Industrial Bank would be to foster in-
dustry as the Credit Foncier banks fostered agricul-
ture. Whereas an ordinary bank would have to treat
budding industries as ordinary risks and deal with
them on a strictly commercial basis, an Industrial
Bank would be really in existence to take special
risks that were likely to build up national in-
dustries and stem the flood of unemployment. There
is room for an army of great organisers in Australia,
and there is a small army of good organisers waiting
for the opportunity—but till Fisher gets that.-tariff
wall elected right round the continent, and puts Aus-
tKliau industrial expans.on o, a sound basis,
nothing can lie done. The organisers will get no
chance, the industries will ret start, and the price
of manufactured goods will rise while the purchasing
powers of the people decrease.
Will Andrew Fisher lift up his voice in song,
and dance like David before the Ark, and say what
lie proposes to do about the matter V

“Jeames”: The current London papers

are not members of a vaudeville troupe but
German noblemen —fled from their .Somer-
setshire (England) home, Croydon Hail,
just before war was declared, leaving
behind them furniture, art treasures and
so on, valued at £lOO,OOO. Count Fritz von
Hochherg, who is a cousin of Prince Henry
of Pless, had lived in England for years,
lie visited Australia recently, and Wnefl
he got back wrote a book about the Com-
monwealth which was a masterpiece or
frankness and self-revelation. He found
Australians to be crude, socially, to a
lamentable extent. The only kindred souls
whom he discovered locally were Mr. Jimmy
Osborne, of Gundaroo. and the Philip Mor-
ton family. The cooking at the hotels
shocked him, and he considered most of the
clubs to be rotten--though he had words of
good cheer for the Melbourne Club and the
Union Club, Sydney. He spoke English
far better than many of our most passionate
Imperialists for example, Alderman
Thomas Henley, M.L.A. —and had the voice
and manner of an intensely courteous
middle-aged lady.
“Y.” tackles a moot point
Was ii; on a Sunday in January or a Sunday ill
February, 1788, that that somewhat flaccid but
bookish chaplain, the Rev. Richard Johnson, cele-
brated the first Church of England service under a
tree near the foot of the present GeorgC-strCet;
Sydney? That is the question set down for dishuSsidri
before the Synod, at Sydney, On September 28. “On
Sunday after landing’’ was the general early inscrip-
tion, but what Sunday always engendered doubt. It
is certain that Phillip made no arrangement for Sueb
a service, and the custom has been to treat the first
Sunday after the landing as the anniversary. But a
little manuscript book by Surgeon Bowes, exhibited in
Sydney a short while back, states distinctly that the
Rev. Johnson preached on shore for the first time Oil
February 3, and, on the strength of this, the Synod
will be asked to order that in future the commemora-
tion services shall take place on the first Sunday in
February. The difference is between the first Sunday
after Anniversary Day and the first after February 3.
The Rev. D’Arcy Irvine heads a contingent for the
latter, aijcl the old brigade stand firm for the former.
But does the Bowes diary settle the point? It says
only that the parson preached on shore for the first
time on February 3. May he not have held it prayer-
meeting service earlier? He Was a Moravian, any-
way, only lately converted to the Church Of England,
and may have conducted a service without a sermon.
Moreover, he never was much of a preacher, and
WOuld, therefore, without concern, drop that item,
thus leaving Bowes right and the old brigade right.
Which makes all hands and the bottle-o correct, and
it doesn’t matter, anyhow.

appointed a second time. The first name on the
roll was George Allen; the last was Allen Taylor.
There have been eight Presidents, two only of whom
(*T. li. Plunkett and W. O. Wentworth) declined
knighthood. The shortest chair-holder was Alfred
Stephen (eight months). He resigned when he
decided that a Chief Justice should not be in

One of the worst results of dyspepsia and stomach troubles is
loss of appetite. You must eat to live, and if you begin to feel you
can’t eat, bad times are coming unless you begin quickly to take
Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach and liver —they restore
appetite and relieve stomach troubles.
It is of the most vital importance to you that you do not allow
dyspepsia, stomach or liver troubles to get a firm hold on you, for
they will surely shorten your life.
The one remedy which is guaranteed to increase the flow of

Kills Pain! Does Not Affect Heart
How Sufferers from HE AD ACHE, NEURALGIA, NEURITIS,
RHEUMATISM, LUMBAGO and SCIATICA may find speedy ,
welcome , certain and permanent relief.
Kephaldol, the new-found remedy.' for pain, is
the product of one of the Continent’s most famous
specialists. (Manufactured in Austin ia.)
Kephaldol is sure, quick-acting, and kills pain
without the risk of any harm to" those who use it.
Unlike other remedies used for Headache, Neu-
ralgia, Neuritis, etc., Kephaldol does not affect
or depress the heart action. IT IS SAFE TO
USE in large or small doses. Doctors by the
hundreds have reported it to be unequalled for the
above troubles, as well as for Rheumatism, Sciatica,
Painful Menstruation and nerve pains generally.
It is guaranteed under the Pure Food Act 1908
of N.S.W., and no other painkiller has the endorse-
ment of the Medical Profession enjoyed by
Kephaldol.
•DOCTORS RECOMMEND IT.-
•‘1 gave Keplialdol tablets in a severe ease of Sciatie
ami the result was most gratifying.”
—Dr. H. Buxton, Somerville. Nr. Seacombe.
Sold in Tidies by Chemists and Storekeepers.

If yon have a difficulty iu obtaining a supnly locally
send a postal note or stamps to the value of tube desired,
and it will be sent you by return post prepaid. Address :

Thousands Testify to the Efficacy of Kephaldol.
“Knowing from experience the value of Kephaldol I
am advising all sufferers I know to use it. Its effect in
relieving pain is wonderful, and I have given it to several
acquaintances with most gratifying results. lam never
without a supply.”—Mrs. I- M. CHOWDER, Dickson's
New Royal Hotel, Shellliarbor.
“For many months my arms were almost useless
from the pain in my shoulders. In fact, I could scarcely
get my clothes on, but could not work.
“A few doses of Kephaldol relieved me, and after a
few days the pain disappeared, and I regained the use of
my arms, and now am not bothered by a good day’s
work.”—HARRY A. SYDENHAM, Gemvi'.le, N.S.W.
'SEE WHAT BRITISH DOCTORS SAY-
“From the results experienced by Ivephaldol in a ease
of Seiatiea and one of Lumbago (probably Rheumatic),
I think it lias all the properties you claim for it.”
—Dr. R. Regan, Maida Vale, W.
“In a ease of Neuritis (probably Alcoholic) I have
found Ivephaldol gave prompt relief from severe pains
which had previously prevented the patient from
sleeping.” —Dr. O. Morris, Birkenhead.
“J have used Kophaldol and given it a thorough test,
and would not be without it. I had suffered for 1-
months from severe headache, and Kephahlol has proved
to be a. splendid remedy. I recommend it whenever I
have an opportunity.’'—-Mrs. JEAN ANTONY. Meeker-
ing. W.A.
“I am subject to severe attacks of Lumbago and
Sciatica, and also to Headaches. One tablet stopped the
attack of the former, and several times prevented Head-
ache by using one or two tablets when the pain began. I
gave a couple of tablets to a friend subject to Influenza,
and they cured him of a bad cold in one night.”—E. .T.

Here are a few reasons why YOU should take “Wincarnis”
If you suffer from Anaemia, Weakness, Sleeplessness, Nerve j
Troubles, Brain-fag, Exhaustion, or if you are “Bun-down” —
“Wincarnis” will give you new health, new strength, new vigor, new
vitality and new life. Just as water revives a drooping flower—-so
“Wincarnis” gives new life to the weakened body. Because “Win-
carnis” is a Tonic, a Bestorative, a Blood-maker and a Nerve-food —
all combined in one clear, delicious beverage. It strengthens the
weak —revives the exhausted —cheers the Depressed —gives new
blood to the Anaemic —vigor to the Fatigued—new vitality to the
“Run-clown” —s lee p to
the Sleepless —and new
life to all whose health
is; not as it sho u 1 cl
be. The effects of “Win-
carnis” are immediate.
You can actually feel it
doing you good. You

system with neiv health, new strength, new vigor, new vitality and
new life. “Wincarnis” does not merely “'whip up” the vitality only
to lower it still further afterwards —but it gives you a solid, sub-
stantial, definite amount of additional health and new life that will
remain for a long, long time after you have finished your bottle of
“Wincarnis Don’t continue to suffer needlessly. Make up
your mind to get a bottle of “Wincarnis” to-day. Be
sure you get “Wincarnis.” Be particularly careful not to
be tempted to accept a wine tonic containing cocaine
or other drugs. “Win-
earnis” is the only wine
ton i e of any repute
that does not contain
drugs. That is one
reason why over 10,000
doctors recommend it.

To-day is the best day t

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile ehnracter) will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appeal on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. ivill be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Sarto: Duly received, a vague note about
a bird “not quite as big as a sparrow.” Almost
every bird is not quite as big as something—a rat or
a cathedral or an Alp or any other old circumstance.
Please be more definite. If you described the Kaiser
as an animal “not quite as large as a horse” that
would throw no light on the present European dis-
turbance. . . .D.C.0.: (1) There was no such monopoly.
(2) The taxation averaged 7 per cent, of the output.
(3) Some have moved up,' others down. Consoli-
dated: (1) “Consols” is merely a contraction of “con-
solidated annuities.” The bulk of the old British
debt was represented by sums received in return for
annuities; in 1751 these debts were “consolidated”
into one fund carrying a uniform 3 per cent. (2)
No material difference. In one case you hold so
many shares in a co. ; in the other, so much stock.
Most cos.’ articles provide for conversion of shares
to stock; but the change is rarely made....
G.W.C.: It’s an old gag that was never worth much.
....Homo: The disparagement in the results of the
firing is the difference between scattered and dense
formation.... Albion: Re your Inky par—guarantees
are necessary.... Doctor: Quite right. .. .Warwick:
Hugh Buckler played the Egyptian in “Bella Donna”
with Julius Knight R.M. (M.L.) : The Germans
know a bit more about the Australian now than Fritz
von Hoehberg’s magazine article told them in Berlin.
.... W. McPherson: Had a par. the other week
relating nearly the same series of difficulties in obtain-
ing the 10s. note in Sydney. Sorry to hear Ipswich
is no more enlightened. .. .Woman: Not worth bother-
ing about. .. .Miner: Don’t know what he promised,
but his word is mostly made g00d.... Light Horse:
“All is Not Yet” is not up.... 8. J. Stark: Thanks.
.. . .The Tramp: Libellous as you have written it. .. .
Murkah : Wireless par. wouldn’t pass. .. . E.N.C.W.:
Nothing new in it... .Shocked: Not enough in it. .. .
E.F.L. (Q.): No. Do you think you could manage
to condense yourself ?... .R.1.P.: Unadulterated
tragedy or mush or something. .. .W.N. (Wanganui):
It’s good penny poetry... .J.C.W.: Your patriotic
poem has been rejected ! Hooray ! Hooray !. .. . Peri-W.:
Clumsy verse. . . .D.L. (Q.) : “When you see the dawn-
light spreading o’er the (something) eastern skies
through the partial gloom that lingers like a pall
before your eyes,” you don't rise and ponder deeply !
No, you throw up your hands, open your head side-
ways, and, half-shutting your eyes, make a sound like
a lion. Why can’t you be natural ? Even the most
learned pig cannot rise and ponder deeply until he
has had his morning stretch and untangled his hair.
....Barbarian: Your first sentence consists of 70
words —your second of 06 words. Get in a supply of
full-stops, take a long breath and a drink of water
and start again... .P.J.M.: All humorous stories
about an Ebenezer are hard going. .. .Arthur W. A.:
“Possessions” doesn’t rhyme with “cow,” “Vatican”
or “illustrious.” It doesn’t even rhyme with
“orange.”... .K.: Unsuitable. .. .D. 8.: Your dirge is
duller than a dirge should be. .. .Joseph P. M.: You
are quite right. The British lion should not be
made to look like a sick cat. But why did you, a
confessed patriot, make it 50?... .G.L.: Always attach
your full name and address to a manuscript. It in-
spires confidence —modest initials don’t. Not B.
stuff. Might go elsewhere if it had a stamp to go
home with. .. . J.W.M.P.: Sorry to hear that your
heavy feet have grown to loathe the city street. Take
your heavy feet aside and reason with them. Point
out to them that it makes it very awkward for you.
. ...Atty: Oh, you singing patriots! If all the bad
poets were good shots war would be much shorter.
. ...A.W.C.: Well, why didn’t you write something
interesting about him?....8i1l Bowyang: Condense.
....Arts Student: Question: “Is it not possible that
some encouragement may be got?” Answer: “It is
quite possible if you will send us something much
better than this artless poem about juvenile kissing.”
.. . .Louis W.: Can’t print it, and don’t want to.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
S.T.: It’s dreadful... .H.M.: Unsuitable. .. .Gee
Gee: Blurred humor and drawing. .. .Harry S.: Old
gag.... Tom G.: Coal item is dull. .. .Rupert E.:
Swear off art or learn drawing. . . .A.J.: Send the libel
to Potsdjrm. W.J.C. is no longer a bright, fresh sub-
ject for caricature. Bush court jest too thin.
Kaiser too black. The Kaiser isn’t a negro
even in his blackest moments... .H.8.D.: Rough
camp wit —too gory and too crude for publi-
cation. . ..Charles J.: Sorry, work of no value.
....Dick G.: Try a medical journal. .. .P. Forsyth:
Unsuitable.... Hector P.: The drawing isn’t satisfac-
tory; it isn’t as satisfactory as cholera... .J.H.C.:
He’s a good average lion, but there isn’t any
particular force in the cartoon... .Patrian: Seventy
years too late.... Reg R.: You’re not a humorist;
you’re a collector... .A.H.H.: Has that jest been
germinating ever since the accident?... .H.F.T.: Joke
suffers from the same complaint as the Devil —old
age.... Harold : It belongs to ancient Egypt. How
did you come by it? Did you steal it while hod-
carrying on the Pyramids j0b?....Wi1l G. (Q.) :
Drawing too stiff —joke too mild.... Rory (Port Mel-
bourne): Same complaint... .H. Doogan: Too early
to say whether you should stick to black and white.
There isn’t an}' black and white sticking to y0u....
M.E.H.: It’s just family-circle brilliance... .A.J.H.
(Q.) : Idea of no practical value. ... J.P.H. (Q.) : You
are not our obedient servant, and it is no honor to
submit such a drawing... .W.D.: Too rough and
spotted,. and the Russian Bear looks like a cat....
J.H.W.: Wooden and expressionless figures... .C.R.C.:
Gag is almost dismal. Learn drawing... .Otho IT.:
Feeble jest. Drawing is neat, but you haven’t got
much humor... .11.C.H.: You can’t draw, and you
can only borrow jokes... .John S. (Melb.): Give it
up; you haven’t much to give, but give it up....
H.L.: Missed the ’bus by a month... .H.S.W.: Muti-
lation is never humorous... .P. McDd: The curse of
the fine pen is on you. And the humor is as thin.
. ...Z.R.: Your gag looks old and your figures seem
to have be.en boiled. Where are your stamps for
return?... .C.H.P.: Some trace of humor, but the
stuff is only half-baked.... K.M.8,: The lawyer’s
head is the most obvious mistake, but there are
others... .N.V.T.: Drawing received. Do it with
your little hatchet?. .. .S.T.: Careful copy of Ameri-
can drawing received ; also careful copy of American
joke. The only thing you forgot to copy was the
artist’s signature, but we can supply it if you like.
....Noel C. (M.L.) : Study hard and try again when
you know something. .. .Will G.: It won’t gee. The
Kaiser is the wrong shape. .. .Will II.: Grim jest
and large, sprawling, useless diagram... .Irresponsi-
ble Prophet: Almost anyone could have had that
vision.

lIOW IS IT DONE?
Well, our managing director, when in Sheffield,
was ordering Solid Silver Goods very largely, and
asked for quotations for an enormous number of
Sauce Boats, to be made at slack times. To be
extra heavyweights that would wear for hundreds
of years. To be of approved designs and plain, so
as to be easily cleaned. To be paid for Spot Cash
against delivery in London.
RESULT. —Solid Silver Sauce Boats, of unparal-
leled value. Indeed, Solid Silver at less than the
usual prices of Electroplate. This is one only of a
number of similar-value Solid Silver lines. Sauce
Boats are supplied without tray if desired.

run practically for nothing: it is driven by the wind and
requires NO FUEL whatever to generate electricity. There
is no Smell or Dirt, NO RISK from Fire, Shock or Explosion.
The POWER generated will safely LIGHT your'home in the most
modern, convenient and healthy manner.
The HEATING of dwelling rooms is thereby reduced to a minimum, and
the .soiling and air-vitiating effects of gas, oil and other illuminants is
obviated, and, further, the fire risk is nil. ; -
ELECTRIC FANS can be driven to render hot summer days more bear-
able, and free the home from flies, mosquitoes and other winged pests.
The domestic problem is Solved by the furnishing of cheap power for
VACUUM CLEANERS, ELECTRIC IRONS, WASHING MACHINES, etc.
I Many pumping problems otherwise impossible of solution by the
ordinary windmill pump can be solved by the Automatic Wind >fotor, since
it can be placed in the most exposed position, and the power generated trans-
mitted by wires to a pump driven by an electric motor.

IN BANANA LAND
“Rangan”: The Brisbane City Council
runs an alleged ferry service across the local
river, and for inefficiency it is the ultimate
and phosphorescent limit. The best boat on
the job has been running for 25 years.
Of the later boats, one has deficient engine
power, another is too heavy, another has
faulty steering gear, and all are unreliable.
When there is a fresh in the river they blush
not to land their passengers down near the
meatworks, and then go off the running for
a week. An expert report to hand on the
newest dug-out, the Hetherington, is to the
effect that the most economical thing to do
is to scrap the hull and put the engines in a
new catamaran. The leader of a deputation
on the situation, in his report to the rate-
payers, said, “The main point gained by our
deputation was the promise to ‘mark time’
before any further money was thrown
away!”
The only serious incident in connection
with the final passing of the Home Rule
Bill took place in Warwick. The Irish
element there is solid and patriotic, and it
decided to celebrate the event in spite of
the fact that Kaiser Bill held the stage.
So a party of Hibernians mounted the Town
Hall tower and soon the ould flag of Ireland
was floating aloft. The town clerk,
under authority, hauled down the colors,
and left quickly—with 500 sons of Erin in
his tracks. He was hauled out from ; his
entrenchments, and the flag was recovered,
and soon was restored to the top of the
pole. The town council then appeared in
force and ordered the colors to be struck,
but a strong guard had entrenched itself
in the tower and invited the enemy to come
on, ye divils. The Mayor sent for the police,
who arrived and inspected the situation, and
after a consultation informed the Mayor that
it was a kind of situation out of their line.
By this time a fatigue party had supplied
the guard with victuals, and sounds of
revelry and corks saluted the triumnhant
flag. The Mayor led several attacks up the
gangway, but the bhoys poured beer on his
whiskers, and he was repulsed. Finally, a
forlorn hope resulted in the Mayor receiving
a nasty wound with a bottle, which was
thrown in with the beer, and the attack was
called off until towards sunset, when the
flag was hauled down, and the guard cut its
way through the besiegers and entrenched
itself in the nearest pub. It was a great
day, entoirely.
From Brisbane Courier: —
The True Briton and -the True Australian
will surely not tolerate the candidates who cast away
the Red, White and Blue of Old England and don
the Republican Red. This being so, vote straight
for Liberals who stand by and seek to uphold the
Red, White and Blue.
Now, what does the Courier deduce from
the sweeping Federal Labor victory ?
(1) Does it say that “the true Briton
and the true Australian” have thereby
shown their intention to throw over
Great Britain and declare for a re-
public? (2) Has the Tory sheet come
to the decision that its “Liberal” nominees
were so despised by “the true Briton and the
true Australian” that the latter would vote
even for candidates who would “cast away
the red, white and blue of Old England,”
rather than again trust the “Liberals” on
the Treasury benches? Or (3) does the
Courier desire the public to understand that
the exhortation to “the true Briton and. the
true Australian” was merely the usual dirty
piece of “Liberal” party lighting?
THE STRONG DEFENCE OF AUSTRIA.
VALIANT BUT ILLITERATE RUSSIAN GENERAL: “Danish! Well have to pass this place,

despatches."
The steamer Southport turned up in Bris-
bane last week, and told an interesting story.
She was at the Caroline Islands loading
phosphates when news of the Kaiser’s per-
formance was given by tbe German warship
Geier. The German captain said he wouldn’t
sink the Southport, as he preferred to get
prize money for her, later; but, to prevent
her getting away, he would remove, some of
her ifiachinery, which he forthwith pro-
ceeded to do. And then he put to sea. After
the departure of the war boat, the South-
port’s engineers inspected the damage. They
found the boilers and the propeller intact,
but a lot of little things of importance miss-
ing. However, they got busy, and in two
days the chief engineer reported that he
could make the ship go slowly ahead, but
not astern. “That’s all we want,” said the
captain, and the ship turned her nose for.
the open sea. Incidentally the provisions
were very short, and the crew were put on
quarter rations. The reward of the risk
taken was that the Queensland coast was
reached without mishap, and the course
set for Brisbane. One of the first coastal
vessels sighted was the wrecked Marloo, and
the crippled Southport stood by to give
assistance. Having given first aid, she
crawled along to Brisbane, and her crew
are now modestly engaged in saying that
they don’t mind if they do.
Under the Paint.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir Gallants, I wot ye be gay,
I know ye be fond o’ the fair;
Ye worship sweet Nellie or May,
Ye’d die for a lock of their hair;
Ye sing of its ripple of gold,
Of eyes that are fit for a saint.
But if ye would love her as men did of old.
And trust in her faith as ° treasure untold,
Forbear to look under the paint!
Reformers volcanic with zeal,
Believers in bolus and pill,
Go building your new Commonweal,
Your city to shine on a hill!
But when ye have marshalled your men.
Beware lest they falter and faint,
For humans are mostly but sheep in a pen :
Ye free them o’ prison, they seek it again—
Forbear to look under the paint!
Ye zealots who bend at the shrine,
Who sigh for the marvels to come,
Whose ban is on woman and wine,
On Fame and the roll of her drum,
If firm ye would cherish your creed
And hold it a thing without taint,
Be wary and peer not too deeply therein,
For even your prophets are salted with sin—
Forbear to look under the paint!
Ye grovellers who cringe to the Great,
Get rid o’ the crook in your knees;
Your raptures in pity abate —
Each dog lias his cargo of fleas.
The Gilded, who fling you a nod,
Are careless of you and your plaint,
They rose by their greed to the rank of a
god
Their record will shame, when they’re under
the sod —
Oh, never look under the paint!
My brothers! If Life ye would taste
And drink with a joy and a zest.
Remember this truth in your haste —
Illusion’s the soul of the jest ;
The world is a stage that we fill
With pictures both tragic and quaint.
You have but a day to gaze at your will;
You spoil the whole show if you poke with
your bill —
So never look under the paint!

Brisbane, October 3, 1914,
My Dear Thabgomindah, —
Who was the dull-wit that said, “All is
not bold that titters”? I hope we know our
sex better than that! Following the
courageous example of tile girls or N. o.
Wales, who recently enrolled themselves (or
some of them) as the Australian Lady Vol-
unteers, a detachment of females, here aie
preparing to arm themselves with lethal
weapons for the defence of the meeker sex
and this fair heritage of the North bo
far, they have not advanced into the lime-
light but I hear that so soon as their uni-
form’s leave the tailors the roll will be. called
publicly. The uniform is to be khaki coat,
with military pockets, and short skirt. The
only touch of feminine vanity —besides the
shortness of the skirt —is to be a scarlet
shoulder strap. I haven’t heard yet what
sort of hat the Mary Atkinses are to wear,
but I’m sure, on the word of a reliable spy,
that it will be perfectly lovely. Regiment’s
motto : “To arms !”
To-day there was a concerted attack of
church fetes, but, by rapid evolutions, the
Lieut.-Excellency and the various Mayor-
esses, assisted by Mrs. Barnes, managed to
overwhelm the rush. No less than six of
these affairs raged in the suburbs, and, in
addition, there was a big sports afternoon
at the Exhibition, where Nudgee College
carnival is still doing sound business.
This week saw the marriage of Josephine
Frost and Chas. Hall. The little bride, who
is scarcely out of her teens, looked very
pretty in the usual white robe. Sister
Gladys Frost, very handsome in pink, was the
bridesmaid, and papa Frost gave his young-
est chick away.
One of tlig newest engagements is that
of Captain Fbed Ryder, of the Queensland
Expeditionary Force, and Phyllis Holmes.
The bride-elect is calming her excitement by
knitting socks for the troops who have heard
the tribal call from Europe.
One of those quaint newspapers that hang
out a precarious shingle in far distant parts
of the South Seas drifted in this week.
Among other things it chronicled joyously:
“Another French victory. Germans have
lost Elan !”
Enid Macalister, second daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. James Macalister, of Milton, has

Mr. and Mrs. Frost nourished a large

stirred up the waterfront by casting the Ban-
analand Government in heavy damages as a
result of the piling up the E. and A. liner
Eastern while in charge of pilots in tn
employ of the State. Last year the N.S.W.
Supreme Court declined to inquire into a
similar claim made by tlie owners ot tne
steamship Bannockburn. It biffed the plain-
tiff out with the intimation that a Govern-
ment is not bound by any default on tlie
part of a pilot. This case was thought to
have settled the bitterly-argued question;
but now Chubb, of Queensland, has set the
old chariot rolling again, and the mercantile
marine is making heavy weather. I don t
know the exact rights of the Eastern case,
but the N.S.W. Full Court was so emphatic
on the general question that developments
are awaited with interest and mixed lan-
guage. , . ,
The Governor-General had a brick thrown
at him by Labor Senator Ferricks, who told
a Brisbane audience that his Ex. should be
advised to resign because of his. conduct in
dissolving the Australian Parliament. It
seems like ingratitude. The Governor-
General’s action was strictly in accordance
with the Constitution. If it . hadn’t been,
someone would have hauled him up before
the High Court and suppressed him. His
doings led to the Liberal Cook going out of
office and Fisher coming in with a good
majority. Also Ferricks retained his seat.
On the face of things Ferricks, if he had
been a gentleman, would have. presented his
harmless, necessary Ex. with a potted
geranium instead of a denunciation.
“Alricli”: Our Binglii of North Queens-
land seems to have troubles always handy.
As soon as a parental Government rids him
of one lot somebody presents him with
another. His first menace was the “square
face” and bad whisky with which the whites
paid him for the meagre amount of toil they
could persuade him to do. The State legis-
lated against that, and prohibited the supply
of intoxicants to an aboriginal. Enter the
Yellow Peril with his dried poppy juice, and,
behold, Jacky slipped a few notches further
down the social scale. Opium, and the
association with Ah Sin consequent on its
use, pretty nearly settled Jacky. Such was
his craving for the drug that employers, of
nigger labor were forced to keep supplies.
But in 1907 the Commonwealth prohibited
the importation of opium, "nd Jacky got a
new lease of life. The black and his lubra
had, however, become useful to our yellow
brother on his cane farms and banana plan-
tations, so Ah Sin introduced him to
another dope—morphia. And the end of the
race of Jacky again hove in view. The Chow
buys the drug from the warehouses for 10s.
an ounce. He adulterates it t nearly twice
its bulk with cream of tartar, etc., and sells
it to the aboriginal at 255. an ounce. Jacky
puts as much as covers a. sixpence into a
quart billy of water and'drinks the solution,
about a wineglassful at a time, making the
quart last for a day. The dope soothes his
nerves and engenders a balmy feeling of rest-
fulness, but by nightfall Jacky is about
“done in,” and he falls into a sodden sleep.
He is a nerveless wreck, hollow-eyed and
gaunt, twitching like a person afflicted with
St. Vitus’ dance, until a fresh dose of the
poison pulls him together again. In Cairns
recently the police proceeded against a China-
man for selling morphia to a blackfellow,
but medical evidence showed that morphia
cannot rightly be called opium within the
meaning of the Act. So the Chow got off;
and unless some new thing is done for Jacky
it won’t be long before he is merely a memory
and a subject for grandfathers’ tales.

ROETTE.
On the score of Purity alone you ought
to choose “DE RESZKE ” CIGARETTES.
HOW much importance do you attach to real purity in Cigarettes? Does
your desire for purity outweigh all other considerations? It certainly
should.
“De Reszke” Cigarettes are made under perfectly hygienic and sanitary
conditions. They are made by healthy workers amid healthy surroundings.
The factory in which “De Reszke” Cigarettes are made is regularly inspected
by H.M. Government Factory Inspector, by the Sanitary Authorities, and an
officer of the Inland Revenue visits the factory daily. In addition, we have our
own Medical Officer, and an inspector whose sole duty is to safeguard the purity
of the “De Reszke” Cigarettes during their manufacture.
Purity is our primary consideration—we spend large sums every year in the
cause of purity alone. Every working day of the year “De Reszke” Cigarettes
are critically examined for purity by a leading analyst.
Under such supervision we feel we are entitled to say “De Ueszke” Cigarettes
are absolutely pure. But quite apart from our word you have the evidence of
the Institute of Hygiene (a body composed of England's greatest medical
authorities), and numerous well-known connoisseurs, including many members
of the English Royalty and Aristocracy, who say the “De Reszke” has no
injurious effect on the throat.
Why continue to smoke an inferior brand? Buy a box of “De Reszke”
Cigarettes, and your own palate will prove their superiority.
The “De Reszke ” Cigarettes you buy in your own Store are identical in every way with those that are sold in England.
They are made in the same factory, of the same tobacco, by the same workers, and reach you in exactly the same
condition as the smoker in England receives them.

A PUSH BUTTON ON EVERY MACHINE MEANS
Reduced Fire Risk, because all heavy currents are broken in a magnetic blow-out,
carefully protected by an asbestos shield. Short circuits and overloads are
taken care of by the relay.
Increased Production, because each operator can push the button to start or stop ‘
this motor and can devote the remainder of his time to actual production.
Decreased Maintenance, because General Electric Co. (U.S.A.) Industrial

“T. 0.1.”: A picture theatre, The Palla-
dium, is to be erected in Pitt-street, Sydney,
with only a right of way between it and Her
Majesty’s. The building which is to be
wiped out to make room for the new “shop ”
was known as Durno’s. Many years ago it
was Joseph Thompson’s softgoods wholesale
store; then Steffanom dealt there in tapestry
and such like. For years past it has been a
druggist’s. Her Majesty’s site used to be
occupied by one of Sydney’s best-known
butcheries, run by one Weir, successor to
Fred Kosten, who, however, dealt only in
cold pig.

in Men, Women, and Children
Dr. ANDREW WILSON writes:
“It can be definitely stated
“that Iron ‘Jelloids’ constitute
“ the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poor-
“ness of Blood. The sufferer is able
“to take Iron ‘ Jelloids * without danger,
“ even with pleasure, and with the sure
“knowledge that benefit will accrue.”
and re “ MEN AND TONICS.”
“ There is a curious notion entertained by
“ the General Public that Iron Medicaments
“ are necessary for women only, and not for
“Men. This is an erroneous idea. Now I
“ have found the form of Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ put
“up with Quinine (called Iron ‘Jelloids’
“No. 2a) to be an excellent tonic for men,
“and may be specially recommended.”
ANEMIA
AFSAF
Breathing, hurried and gasping, on the slightest exertion, pale cheeks
lacking the ruddy glow of health, bloodless lips, a general feeling of weari-
ness-accompanied maybe by pain after food, indigestion—constipation,
listlessness, inability of application to any pursuit or even train of thought
depression of spirits, and irritability of temper. Such symptoms indicate
Anaemia, and should, on no account, be neglected.
t
ft
•ir«
will remove the causes and symptoms of Anaemia. Iron is
what your system requires. By taking it in the form of Iron
‘Jelloids’ the not uncommon disadvantages of other Iron
tonics are avoided. No ill-effects are set up. No constipation.
No “rust ”in the stomach. No danger of non-absorption.
No fear of injury to the teeth. If you would have radiant
health, an elastic step and well-braced nerves, you must
have healthy blood. To improve and strengthen the blood
take Iron ‘Jelloids,’ commended by Medical Men, and
favourably reviewed by the Medical Press. Ag a general
tonic Iron ‘Jelloids ’ are excellent. They are pleasant and
easy to take.
A Reliable Tonic
Miss Sutton, 34, Dover Street, Higher Crumpsall, writes: —“I have been
a sufferer from Anaemia for the last n years, and have tried everything in
the form of Iron, but nothing has proved so successful as the 1 Jelloids/
. . . A doctor recommended them. lam pleased to say Iron ‘Jelloids’ do
not cause constipation nor headaches.”
A Fortnight’s Trial (price 1/6) will
convince you.

The Inky Way.
About the most priceless sample of
snuffle of the present war was the sentence
with which London Daily Mail (S/8/’l4)
began its leader: “Thank God, we are one
nation again!” The reference was, of
course, to the collapse of the half-of-Ulster
agitation. Considering that this absurd
row was largely the Mail’s row; that the
paper had been acting the part of agent
provocateur for months, by means of sen-
sational special articles, items from “the
front,” prophecies of the bloodshed that was
inevitable, and shouts of encouragement to
Carson, Craig and the rest of the potential
revolutionists —considering all these things
the. Mail’s cry of joy surely represented the
limit in the matter of nerve. It was as
though an arrested burglar fell down on
his knees and offered up thanks to the
Creator inasmuch as the forces of law and
order had been too much for him.
♦*# „ «
War “specials” have been outdone by
London Daily Chronicle. That paper has
established a War News Bureau, and it
undertakes, during the day, to telephone to
subscribers in the London area, and to tele-
graph to those outside that area, any im-
portant news it receives from the official
press bureaux or from its own correspon-
dents abroad. The subscription rates to
this scheme are: Telephone, 10s. per week;
telegraphic, Is. 6d. per message not exceed-
ing 24 words.
* * * *
Slipped off the Inky Way in Maoriland
last week, Florence McCarthy, aged SO.
He was born in Canada, arrived in the Isles
in the 50’s. and took the editorial chair of
the Wellington Independent. Later, with
Captain Holt, he formed a press agency for
news per telegraph. In 1878 the papers
decided to collect over-sea news themselves,
and McCarthy had to hustle for a crust at
his old job as editor. This time he toiled
on the Grey River (West Coast) Argus.
He remained there for 35 years. The strike
of last year led to differences with the
directors, and he resigned. After that he
wrote a little for the Greymotith Star,
and he was in the middle of this undertak-
ing when the Man with the Meat Axe met
him the other day.
* * * *
English as it is written in Sydney Morn-
ing Herald. In a leading article (21/9/’l4)
regarding the re-opening of the Sydney
Stock Exchange, appears the following:
“The parent institution in Capel-court
(London) having decided In a qualified way
at least to re-open its doors, its local proto-
type is now following suit.” According to
Webster (not Lobster), who is generally
understood to be something of an authority
on English, “prototype” means an original
or model after which anything is copied.
So, according to the Herald, the Sydney
Stock Exchange is the father (or mother)
of the parent, who lives in London !
* * * *
“Second Revise” : Seems to me that Syd-
ney’s morning sheets have practically ceased
to be newspapers since the war started.
Having shed a tramload or so of faithful
gleaners in the early days of the scare, they
now find themselves short of general news —
or I presume they do. It must be a shortage
of news that drives one of them to print on
the leader page complimentary tag-ends of
Yankee business letters sent to a Sydney
merchant by unnamed foreigners in Chicago
(111.), and Something Else (Mass.). The
man who really thinks the typewritten small
change of commerce is a fair substitute for
news is not so much a journalist as a cow.
He certainly doesn’t amount to a horse.
Then, somewhere else, the maddened reader
finds a lady-writer—probably a nice, calm
lady-writer on less patriotic occasions—
shrieking like this in half a column :
One word that Liberty was threatened—not even
her own liberty, but just that of a helpless ally—
and she has leapt to her feet and dashed straight
into the struggle as a very Berserk might have done!
She has not even waited to put all her armor on;
she will don it as best she may as the fight goes on •
but the main thing was to be there without delay’
and she was there.
Presently the people who like news will get
tired of watching lady-writers having ink-
fits. Then the press workers who have
been thrown into a penurious wilderness
may be called to the colors once more.
THE POET'S PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One of the requirements of every war is a
Stipendiary Poet.— Bulletin, 17/9/’l4.
Soldiers, restrain the parting sigh,
Control the farewell tear;
In brief, Buck Up—though you depart
The verse-smith will lie here.
' And through the dreadful nights and days
Write reams of blither in your praise.
How comforting amid war’s howls,
And risks and stress and grime,
To know that, through it all, the Bard
Will still toil overtime,
Constructing verses by the mile
Faultless in sentiment and style.
How runs the line? “They also serve
Who only sit and wait.”
The saying accurately puts
The ready-writer’s state.
He has no wish to go and fight,
He merely wants to stay and write.
As cool as fresh-drawn lager beer;
From every fear exempt;
The Poet on the Kaiser's head
Will calmly heap contempt;
And chide, instruct, denounce and curse
In lyric, blank and other verse.
Nor will he cease when war’s alarms
Have finally died down.
His gracious mission then will be,
With well-turned lines, to crown
Those lucky heroes who contrive
To issue from the fray alive.
Rebuking, praising, blithering,
The Poet sails through life;
He does not yearn to join, himself,
In any sort of strife.
When peril calls through war’s red mist
He is the Perfect Altruist.

Bath Your Baby with
i REXONA SOAP
lU\\Y
£
Soap,
A healthy baby always enjoys a bath,
and Rexona Soap makes your child a
healthy baby. It keeps his skin fresh
and sweet, his scalp so clean and whole-
some. Any irritation of the skin which
keeps baby awake, or makes him cross
and peevish, Rexona Soap
will quickly soothe. A re-
freshing bath with Rexona
and gentle anointing,
with Rexona will cool
his skin, and take
away all discomforts,
so that baby and
mother will sleep
quietly. The pure,
sweet emollients used
in Rexona Soap are
suited to baby’s deli-
cate skin, and keeps it
in the best condition.
Rexona babies are con-
tented babies, because
they feel well cared for and comfortable. Get a tablet of Bexona
Soap from your chemist or grocer. You are sure to like it.
THE REXONA HABIT.
A habit formed is hard to break. Bad habits are easily formed, but good
habits can be attained almost as easily. The Rexona habit results in health and
beauty, and, once formed, will never be broken.
There are two Rexona habits —that of using Rexona Ointment to heal all
injuries to the skin, and the Rexona Soap habit, which consists of keeping oneself
clean and pure with a delicately-seen ted and medicated soap. Rexona Ointment
and liexona Soap mean
skin health and beauty,
comfort to the user, and
immunity from disease.
So form the Rexona
habit. Start with a
is. cake of Rexona Soap
and a is. (id. pot of
Ointment. Soon you will
be glad to know that Rex-
ona Soap is put up in
dainty boxes containing
three cakes each, and that
Rexona Ointment is also
sold in larger-size, trian-
gular pots, containing
nearly four times the
quantity of the Is. (id.
size, which are sold at 3s.
each.

The Cheese that is Served at
the Doctor’s Own Table
Physicians have been trying for years to impress
upon the public the fact that the choice of the
cheese that is eaten is more important than the
choice of meats.
Different cheese represent different bacilli, differ-
ent influences for health or against health.
Doctors prefer
“REX”
Luncheon Cheese
because it is proved by the strictest standards to be SCIENTIFICALLY
CORRECT.
It is delicious. It tempts appetite. It stimulates appetite
for other food. It is digested more easily than any other cheese. It
stimulates digestion of other food. It combats all influences within
the system inimical to health. The whole of its beneficial influence
is absorbed by the system. It contains ORGANIC PHOSPHATES,
the elements which enable the body to rebuild itself and to with-
stand the wear of work, weariness and worry. By ensuring this
rebuilding it puts off the effect of time and age. And it is PURE.
You care as much for your health as the doctor cares for his. Make “Rex”
Luncheon Cheese a part of every meal you eat.
Tell your Grocer to-day to deliver a Jar or Tin.
Other “ Rex ” Canned Delicacies are-

In order to introduce infant morality, New York
opened an educational crusade, which lasted a week.
—Joyful tidinys in the Sydney Freeman’s Journal.
FROM the cradle to the grave
Man, of course, is passion’s slave —
Being prone to wine and woman,
war and horses;
Also many games of chance,
And the devastating dance—
Held by some among the Devil’s strongest
forces!
Man is also given much
To gastronomy, and such,
And mad longings for huge pumpkins and
large roses.
And collecting foreign stamps,
Commandeering orphaned games.
And other things that History discloses.
While the female half of Man,
Which now seeks to lead the van
And become the Super-Lady of Creation,
Though not such a slave to passion
As her mate, runs after Fashion
In a cataleptic trance of adoration!
The dear creatures risk their health
In pursuing those with wealth,
Or anyone whose name has got a handle;
But perhaps their choicest Sin,
And the one they revel in,
Is the deathless joy of tittle-tat-and-scandal!
Now, with parents such as these,
It will follow, if you please
(Of course, I don’t mean anything to hurt
you)
That their offspring will not be
After, say, the age of three,
Little angels or strict paragons of virtue!
White or yellow, black or brown,
You may fairly set it down —
What with aches and pains and whimperings
and wailings,
Brushes, water, soap and pins,
And its embryonic sins—
That the tender human infant has its fail-
ings !
Still, we bear with these; we know
That Dame Nature planned it so,
And these failings are not certain indica-
tions
Of a criminal career
On this sublunary sphere;
If they were —well, what a prospect for the
nations!
Yet, it seems there is one spot
Where the babies are a lot
Of immoral little rogues, to Ruin drifting!
From New York, in U.S.A.,
Word arrived the other day
That the morals of its infants need uplift-
ing !
In all other lands ’tis known
That the adults are too prone
To leave the narrow path that leads to
Glory ;
Now some shocking news arrives
Of the New York babies’ lives—
It really is a lamentable story!
Hebrew babies in New York
Raid the butchers’ shops for pork,
And the Bowery’s the district where they
loot worst;
Bach distracted parent stands
With uplifted, helpless hands
Watching wicked little Abey wolfing blut-
wurst!
Irish infants in New York,
Whose progenitors left Cork,
Or Clare, or Tipperary, in the ’eighties,
Have completely lost control
Over body, mind and soul
Of childher who steal buttermilk and praties !
Like the Irish and the Yids,
All New Yorkers find their kids
Wholly scornful of their “dummies” and
their corals;
At a few months old they curse,
Beat their mother, stab their nurse,
And are utterly devoid of decent morals!
Some who don’t know where to stop
Visit Uncle in his shop,
And they borrow all the cash that he will
lend them ;
Others, who refuse to work,
Carry on like any Turk,
Anl have half a dozen women to attend
them!
Others borrow motor-cars
r And joy-ride round all the bars,
The very hint of pay for liquor .scorning!
While still others, wholly Lost,
Order goods, at any cost,
V hich they purchase with a cheque that’s
stopped next morning!
Things have come to such a pass
That the citizens en masse
Have risen up in protest at these capers;
For the credit of the town,
These vile babes must be put down
By an Infants’ Morals League—see New
York papers!

The Death of William Nye.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From the Sydney Morning Bloodstain :
, ' A HERO PASSES.
FRENCH GENERAL’S TRIBUTE.
Paris, Tuesday.
William Nye, of the Grenadier Guards,
lms been killed in action in Lorraine.
General Joffre said of him: “A terrible
fellow Nye. We have seen nothing like him
hitherto.”
[General Joffre —known universally as the Gallic
Kitchener—is the Generalissimo of the French Army.
He has not been famed, so far, as an epigrammatist,
hut it is safe to predict that his terse commentary
on our English hero —now, alas! no. more—will rank
in literature with Napoleon’s classic remark about
“these British bulldogs,” and Wellington’s aphorism
on the subject of “the playing fields of Eton.” Nye,
whose name is now enshrined in the archives of his-
tory, was a Grenadier Guardsman—a proud distinc-
tion in itself. Lorraine lies due east of Paris, and
has been aptly termed “one of the lost provinces of
France.” — Editor, S. M. Bloodstain.]

WAR NOTES.
The regretted death of William Nye, of the Grena-
diers (the cable does not mention that he held com-
missioned rank, so we may assume that he was a
private) casts light on several strategical problems
that had, up to now, been shrouded in mystery. In
the first place, it is evident that the Grenadiers are
operating in Lorraine. That is, unless Nye was there
by himself —an improbable contingency, inasmuch
as it would lay him open to a charge of desertion,
the which, if sheeted home, would cause him to
be immediately executed. What are the Grenadiers
doing in Lorraine ? Their objective is probably
Worms, on which a vast Russian force was known
to be advancing six weeks ago. Could the Grena-
diers once junction with the Russians at Worms
the way would be clear to Dresden —a pleasant town
of well-shaded bier-gartens and comfortable hotels,
in which I passed many a merry hour in early
youth.
* * * *
General Joffre would seem from the tenor of the
message to have personally witnessed William Nye’s
superb feat of arms. We may deduce from this
that he has left the Toul-Chalons line, and is making
with all possible despatch in the direction of Berlin.
Should our exclusive cable of last week, to the
effect that 500,000 British and Indian troops had
arrived in Oldenburg, via Bremerhaven, be correct,
there is every prospect of the General's daring move
being a complete success. The only things against
it are the fact that all the official cable messages agree
(1) that no British or other troops have arrived in
Oldenburg; (2) that General Joffre is still with the
main French army in the neighborhood of the Aisne.

Nye Grenadier Guards Joffre Briggs.
Note from “Jeames” —Thursday :—■
William Nye, slain in action on Tuesday last
was—assuming him to be the man I knew a dozen
years ago—extremely popular in English Society. lie
belonged to the Northumberland branch of the Nye
family, whose head, Sir Pontius, is now doing time
in Dartmoor Gaol, for a series of absolutely heroic
frauds on the widows and orphans of Ardnamurchan
- —pronounced Arrdnamurrahan. Sir Pontius repre-
sented to his victims that he had an infallible
scheme for swindling the South Sea Island natives
out of their copra , and other valuables by means of
the three-card trick. The thrifty Scots fell in
wholesale. Sir Pontius dissipated their savings in
loose living—mostly at his palatial residence in
Hertford-street, Park Lane, W. His offer of a gold
horse-trough for use in Buckingham Palace grounds—
which offer, by the way, was rejected by King
Edward VII. with contumely—provided one of the
sensations of the 1905 season. Young William Nye
—a nephew of Sir Pontius—evidenced his courage,
even in those days, by telling an anxious widow who
had called at the Hertford-street house in quest of
dividends that “the whole Islands scheme was a
ramp.” It was this fearlesss disclosure that led
to the proceedings in which Mr. Yelp, K.G. (now
Lord Howl of Strathspey) achieved fame and Sir
Pontius 10 years’ penal servitude.

TO BILL.
(Obit. Tuesday.)
You may not breast the oak again in any earthly
bar;
Nor hold the hand that hands the beers; nor gaze
into the eyes
That have disturbed the peace of homes from Hamp-
stead Heath, afar,
To Brompton-road and Fulham and the slopes of
Kensal Rise.
You cannot hear our vinous cheer, and now you never
will,
What time we grab our hats and start to do the
dear old rounds;
We may not fill 'em up, on earth, in company, but,
Bill,
We’ll swing the axe at Heaven’s bar when the final
trump resounds.

CORRESPONDENCE.
To the Editor,—
Sir, —Far be it from the writer to intrude the
sectarian issue at such a juncture as this (that is
an unworthiness which I leave to the degraded
outcasts who oppose -us), but in justice to the
cause of Protestantism I would like to mention that
the William Nye who so heroically yielded up his life
for the Empire on Tuesday last was, apparently, a
Past Grand Master of the Derry Prentice Lads’
Lodge, No. 17. Members of the Nye family have
been resisting the encroachments of Rome, in and
around Belfast, for the past two centuries. Herb
Nye, an ancestor of the immortal William, fell at the
Battle of the Boyne, and by adroitly feigning death
until the worst was over, lived to put many a sting-
ing controversial stroke across Rome in the highly
argumentative years which followed. It was appro-
priate that Herb’s distinguished descendant should
have perished while upholding the cause of Belgium,
France and Protestantism generally, against the
Kaiser and his Jesuitical legions.
Yours in the sacred cause of amity and good-
feeling,
Digges la Touche Snowball, W.G.M.

One of the greatest living
physicians, referring to piles,
says The pain is often so
intense that the patient feels
he can neither walk nor lie,
while in some cases the loss
of blood is so great as to con-
stitute a grave danger
The way in which piles yield to Zam-Buk
is nothing short of remarkable. The con-
centrated and carefully combined ingredi*
ents of which Zam-Buk is composed take
away the inflammation; and the pain and irrita-
tion, which at times almost amounts to agony,
is relieved the moment the healing balm is
applied.
Confirmation of this statement is furnished by Mr. J.
Abood, of Albion Street, Warwick, Q., who says:—
“ Three years ago I suffered all the agony incidental to
piles. At times I would pass nearly half a cupful of blood,
and became so distressed that life was perfect misery. I
suffered all the time when either standing or lying down. I
tried all sorts of ways and means in my endeavor to rid
myself of this miserable complaint, but the many so-balled
remedies I used proved fruitless. At last I thought I would
give Zam-Buk a trial, and from the very first application of
the balm I derived relief. The burning inflammation
gradually subsided and the terrible pains were subdued,
and ten days after the first applications of Zam-Buk I was
completely cured of the piles. I feel convinced I had as bad
an attack of piles as any of rny acquaintances, some of whom were
troubled for years, and they were astonished at the speedy cure Zam-
Buk had effected in my case.
“ I cannot speak too highly in favor of this wonderful balm, and
will never be without a pot. It is now three years since Zam-Buk
brought me ease and comfort, in place of torture and distress, and as I
have not had the slightest symptoms of piles since, I feel quite satis-
fied the cure is permanent.”

RITA MOYA discourses on
NATURAL BEAUTY,
and how to obtain it.
To-day every woman of taste and refinement avoids the nse of cosmetics of madd-Up
toilet preparations which give an artificial appearance. The fresh, natural complexion that
few women have, and every woman desires, is best obtained by use of original ingredients
already at hand or which can be obtained from any reliable chemist, My advice is to avoid
the use of most made-up face creams, rouge and beautifying preparations, They are Usually
obvious and often disappointing. If you will get only the proper original ingredients you will
be satisfied with the result. Insist on having what you ask for, If the chemist does not
happen to have it in stock, he can immediately get it from his wholesaler,
Good Shampoo Important.—The hair should
be allowed to breathe, and the greasy flint
around each strand must be removed with a
mild non-alkaline shampoo. Soaps should be
tabooed. The very best solution for the pur-
pose can be made by dissolving a teaspoonful
of stallax granules in a cup of hot water. It
stimulates the scalp to healthy action, and at
the same time leaves the hair in that soft,
fluffy condition so much admired. Any chemist
can supply you with an original packet of
stallax, sufficient to make 25 or 30 shampoos.
Magic for Superfluous Hair. —It is astound-
ing the number of women who suffer from
unsightly growths of hair on the face, and it
will come as a piece of good news to know
that there is a simple substance known as
powdered plieminol which will remove it im-
mediately and permanently. Mix a small
quantity into a thin paste with a little water,
and apply to the objectionable growffhs. In
two minutes all trace of the hair will have
entirely vanished, and your skin will be as
soft and smooth as a child's.
To have Smooth, White Skin all through the
Winter.—Does your skin chap or roughen
easily, or become unduly red or blotchy? Let
me tel) you a quick and easy way to over-
come the trouble and keep your complexion
beautifully white, smooth and soft. .Tust get
some ordinary mercolised wax at the chem-
ist’s, and use a little before retiring as you
would use cold cream. The wax, through
some peculiar action, flecks off the rough, dis-
colored or blemished skin. The worn-out
cuticle comes off just like dandruff on a dis-
eased scalp only in almost invisible particles
Mercolised wax simply hastens Nature’s
work, which is the rational and proper way to
attain a perfect complexion, so much sought
after, but very seldom seen. The process is
perfectly simple and quite harmless.
For Dry, Irritating and Dandruffy Scalps.
—Nothing can compare with the following
recipe for the above condition, and txntii yon
have rectified any trouble in this direction it
is useless to expect the hair to grow healthy
and vigorous; Mix a package of bortinium
with i-pint of bay rum, shake the bottle well
and allow to stand for 30 minutes, then add
i-pint cold water and strain. This simple
home remedy will stimulate the hair roots to
their normal functions, resulting in a beauti-
ful growth of new hair.
Bouge Not Necessary.—lf you must add a
little color to the cheeks please do not use
rouge; it is always so painfully obvious that
women of refinement have now discarded it
for ever. There is a little-known substance
called colliandum obtainable at most chem-
ist’s, which can be used in its place. It gives
a perfectly natural tint and defies the closest
scrutiny, besides having the undoubted ad-
vantage of not rubbing off.
The Powder Puff Passes. —A persistently
shiny nose, or a dull, lifeless complexion
drives many a woman to cosmetics and conse-
quent despair. And all the time a simple
remedy lies at hand in the home. Get from
your chemist about an ounce of cleminite.
and add sufficient water to dissolve it. A
little of this simple lotion is Nature’s own
beautifier. It is very good for the skin and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lasts all day or evening, renders powdering
entirely unnecessary and absolutely defies
detection.
Miscellaneous Hints. —For lips inclined to be
rough or harsh use a soft stick of prolactum.
An ideal complexion soap is one called
pilenta. It contains no free alkali, and is as
near neutrality as science can make it.
To make the eyelashee grow long, dark ano
curling, massage them gently with memsaime.
It is quite a harmless substance, and will not
injure the eyes.
We had not heard of him for years,
And now we learn, with pain,
That he has died a hero’s death
In battle in Lorraine.
You cannot see our tears, William,
You cannot hear us call.
There is nothing’ left to answer
But your photo, on the wall.
From the Socialist. — Friday.
The swaggering swashbuckler, William Nye, has
met his deserts. A cable tells of his richly-earned
death in Lorraine while fighting for the twin causes
of militarism and capitalism. So perish all uphold-
ers of the wage-slave system. He is followed to his
tomb by a fulsome eulogy from the man Joffre. Better
far had this licensed assassin spared a word of
sympathy for Nye’s deserted widow, who called upon
us yesterday and disclosed the fact that she has been
living on a miserable pittance at 92 South-street,
Woolloomooloo, during all the years that her
dastardly husband has been swanking about the
world in militarist idleness. Subscriptions will be
received at this office, and duly acknowledged.

THE NYE AFFAIR.
A Cruel Hoax.
Paris, Friday.
It transpires that the report of the death, in
Lorraine, of William Nye, of the Grenadier Guards, is
incorrect. There is no such person in the Grenadiers.
The Coldstreams had a regimental Mascot—a goat—
named William Nye, but it has been dead for many
years. General Joffre, who has not been in Lorraine,
angrily disclaims the phrase, “A terrible fellow,
William Nye. We have seen nothing like him
hitherto,” either as applied to Nye (who, as above-
mentioned, does not exist) or to anyone else.

A Few Remarks on Bill and Jim.
WITH A PASSING REFERENCE TO
TOM AND JACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SHOULD like to write a few lines on
the subject of Australia’s two most
famous buslimen, about whom I —in
common with so many other Australian
writers—have written so much in the past,
both in prose and verst. I allude to Bill and
Jim, and I wish to clear up some misconcep-
tions with regard to their characters. It
might not seem a very interesting subject, in
view of the war; and yet it is, in a way, for
Jim is going there in force. You look up
the names in the lists of the Australian expe-
ditionary forces, and see if lie isn’t. You’ll
find Jack not very far behind, and Bill and
Tom come about third in order of numbers—
not of merit. I’ll tell you why.
By the way, “expeditionary” force is a
good name—and wise. It is a bit of an ex-
pedition, there isn’t any doubt about that;
and the name is a wise precaution, because
it will come in handy whenever we’re licked.
But, dash the war for the present! Let’s
get on with Bill and Jim.
In the first place, there isn’t, and never
was, any “Biljim.” He’s a monster that was
, invented by some alleged writer who never
knew either Bill or Jim, and is equally
unknown to them. Their natures are as far
apart as the poles are. Bill is more like
Tom, and Jack takes after Jim—or before
him, as the case may be. You will —or you
would, in my time —find Bill mostly at home,
at work in the township as a blacksmith or
something, or pottering round the house, or
toiling on the “farm.” The Old Selection is
dead now and mostly deserted—l saw some
of the ghosts when I was up country last.
But the whereabouts of Jim is often uncer-
tain, and for various reasons—some of them
urgent. Bill is steady and easy going. His
fortnightly or monthly little spree in the
township is a quietly grinful and good-
natured, and an absolutely harmless affair.
In this he is resembled by Tom in every
respect. It is entirely different with Jim. In
common with the rest of us he has a kink
somewhere in his head, and the whisky gets
at that kink straight away. This accounts
for his frequent absences. The last time I
was home Jim went into town to keep sober,
and got loose, and broke up a picture show,
and kicked a policeman who was looking for
him in another direction. The show was
screening an alleged Australian drama—“ The
Squatter’s Daughter,” or something—and Jim
had been Outback. The policeman hadn’t
been Outback, so Jim got into trouble. This
was an exceptional case.
Jim’s intentions are good, and that is the
worst of him. I never met a real Jim that'
was any good; but, on the other hand, I
never met one that was unpopular. Of
course, there are bogus Jims. In mild cases
(for Jim) the local constable will often give
his sister or his sweetheart a hint that there’s
a “blue paper” out for him. The sweetheart,
by the way, is nearly always a quiet, hard-
working girl—sometimes a country barmaid
or a waitress at the railway refreshment
room-—and it’s an awful pity she ever
marries Jim. What she sees in Jim in the
first place only Heaven and women know.
But it’s always that way.
Anyway, on getting the hint, Jim borrows
a horse from a friend (after sundown) and
makes out for the “Lachlan side,” or some-
where. At the end of the first stage he
borrows another horse from another friend
( also modestly), and lets the first one go
back. And so on till he reaches his destina-
tion. In. my time the friends used to take
the thing philosophically—even humorously.
Along towards Christmas or Easter the
constable gives the sister or sweetheart
another hint, and Jim turns up on or about
Christmas Eve or Good Friday: and his
mother’s, sister’s or sweetheart’s joy is tem-
pered by anxiety—for Jim is sure to get into
trouble again.
Of course, cards and horse-racing are two
of his curses, and lie always loses. And
lie’s nearly always beaten when he fights.
But he’ll be au acquisition to liis company
when he gets to the front in the matter of
horse-lifting or horse-borrowing. He was so
in South Africa ; and very popular with his
own regiment in consequence—the more so
because it was a matter of perfect indiffer-
ence to him as to whether the horses be-
longed to friend or foe. Other regiments,
particularly the City of London Volunteers,
could never see the point of the joke. But,
then, they should not have left their horses
so carelessly picketed.
In some respects he is resembled by Jack.
But Jack is saved by his keen sense of
humor. Jim has little or none. And vastly
amused at both of them come the quiet,
harmless “jokers,” Steve and Dave.
Mind you I am writing of the natural Bills
and Jims and Toms and Jacks—not those
woo have been falsely so-called or christened.
Which reminds me that a dear old German
lady of my acquaintance, in the district I was
brought up in, used to say that all the Ilarrys
were no good. She had a fair specimen. I
was good then, but she said that my name
was a mistake. I should have been a Willie
or a girl. (She had a good Willie.) But
some christenings are prophetic.
Bill is as described; and so is Tom. Tom
has generally Jack for a brother, while Bill
is afflicted with Jim ; but sometimes it is the
other way about. The results are the same.
Whenever anything goes wrong at home, and
Bill happens to be away, they send for Bill.
And when anything goes seriously wrong
with Jim, they send for Bill. Jim has a
great respect for Bill, and won’t hear a word
against him—as indeed he shouldn’t. Bill
regards Jim’s lesser scrapes with humorous
tolerance, and I believe they have a real
affection for each other. Bill’s taste in
literature (when he had any) used to lie in
the direction of “Progress and Poverty,” and
that sort of stuff. Of course, he reads the
newspapers and discusses the news and
articles. And equally, of course, he is full
of the war just now, and not nearly so
befogged about it as many city workmen in
public bars.
Jim reads little or nothing, except much
of what isn’t good for him. He’s a boy on
“Deadwood Dick,” etc.—especially etc.
Bill sticks to the old people and the girls.
The mother and girls are querulously com-
plainful of him most times, and get on with
Jim better. Of course, the mother loves Jim.
But Bill is quiet pals and old mates with
Dad.
And so the time has come at last, and Jim
enlists, as everybody expected he would,
though none can tell why. And so, the long,
last talk at home the night before—so differ-
ent from other nights. And the parting on
the railway station with friends crowding
round. And at last the hand-grips between
Jim and Bill, and Jim and his father, as they
had never gripped bands before. And, last
of all. he kisses mother, and, maybe, strokes
the old head that he had helped to grey, and
sees with a gulp, maybe, the tears of pride in
the old eyes into which he had so often
brought other kinds of tears.
And Dad goes to have a few drinks with
congratulating old cronies (there’s another
sketch here), and Bill goes home to work, and
to prepare the flat along the “crick” for
potatoes, and to turn the eternal cow out of
the long, uncultivated wheat paddock, and put
in seed for a hay crop of some sort there.
“Them things will be wanted before these
wars is over.”
And, no doubt, Jim will come back again
in the fullness (or emptiness) of time, to end
his days, a beloved nuisance, in his own dis-
trict. For there’s always a mistaken Guar-
dian Angel who watches over the welfare and
ill-fare of the Jims of this world.
HENRY LAWSON.
For Valor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, tramp ye to the music
Of the drums, of the drums ;
Oh, march the march of heroes
When the call of battle comes.
Come, muster to my banner,”
We heard the captain say,
“Come, march behind my banner
And I’ll pay you valor’s pay.”
“And what may he your valor-pay
That shall the brave reward,
When we ride from the holding fray
And sheath the thirsty sword?”
“The pillage of the palaces
That genius has reared,
The gibbeting of beaten men
The mighty men you feared,
And all the things that you can thieve
I give you, by my beard !
“Oh. I shall pay you worthy pay,
Wild shrieks of age that flees;
And many a pallid runaway
You’ll hang on roadside trees;
What splendid wreckage for a day
Are dreams of centuries!
“And all the pleasure you can wrest
From maid and matron too,
And all that you can thieve from towns
Whose calm spires pierce the blue ;
All you can thieve in blood and death
Is valor’s noble due.
And when from thunder and alarms
The drum retreat is rolled
My warriors plunge their aching arms
In tons of robber gold !
“Who’s valiant in his savagery?
Who roars for blood and king?
Oh, muster to my brigadiers
And hear the shrapnel sing.
The splendid glow of flaming towns
Shall light your banqueting.
The blasted walls of plundered towns
Our conquering strides o’erarch.
From trembling hill to_ muted sea
Our black death-legions march.
“You’ll march with songs of Fatherland
, r To fatherlands yak’ll wreck,
You’ll shout for splendid valor
With your heel on valor’s neck.
You’ll kiss your baby children
And you’ll kiss your weeping wives,
And march away to blast and burn
A million babies’ lives.
“Mad pride of race and homing hills
This upstart foe infests
The shrieks of bursting shrapnel shell
Silence their boasting breasts ;
And you shall break their futile swords,
And dust shall flush their crests.
“And these shall be your valor-pay
These shall the brave reward,
When groans shall dark the flying day
That shudders from the sword ;
And we ride from the howling fray
And sheath the thirsty sword.”
“Oh, ive have heard your promise, sire,
And we have heard the drum,
Our hearts of valor flame to fire —
We come, hy God, we come!”

Remington
• 2 2 calibre
rifles are built
on principles
which the experi-
ence of makers and
users proves to be right.
Just a few of the advantages:
Solid Breech — No hammer,
therefore no accidental discharge;
no blowbacks”; no “empties”
across line of vision (side ejection);
enclosed mechanism, free from dirt and
grit; arm easily taken apart with the fingers
for cleaning or carrying; graceful lines.
Safety” conveniently placed on the trigger guard.
Fifteen shots without removing rifle from the shoulder.
Safety, comfort, convenience, efficiency and pride—that’s what
Remington .22 calibre rifles mean to the shooter.
Ask your dealer to show you one, or write to us for full information.
Remington Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge Co., 'New York and London
MOST shooters have “ learned how ” with the
.22 calibre rifle—usually in boyhood. Every
boy either owns a .22 calibre or wants one.
Old and young know the truth of this statement.
The old shooter remembers his “first love/*
You can shoot just as well with a .22 as
with any other arm. The modern .22 is
just as well made, and the ammunition,
exactly as good as that of the larger
calibres, is inexpensive.
The rifle is light, easily handled;
may be added to the week-end
equipment of the excursion-
ist without inconvenience.
In choosing a .22 do so de-
liberately. Examine the
best makes. Ask your
dealer to show you a
Remington and con-
vince y o u r s e If
that our claims
are backed
up by the
facts.
