AMERICAN BEGINNINGS
As A. L. Rowse observes in his
admirable The Elizabethans and
America (Macmillan), no country is
more addicted to historical myth than
America.
One American myth that has been
successfully put about for a long time
is that the Pilgrim Fathers were the
true founders of modern America.
They were not. Dr. Rowse vividly
shows that the Massachusetts Puritans
were far more influential than the
Pilgrims, and that, anyway, the shaping
spirit of the country had been injected,
however tentatively, as early as the
1580’s—at “the high water mark of the
Elizabethan age, when everything began
together, the madrigals and the war
with Spain, the Shakspearian drama
and the English colonisation of
America, which was to receive in the
fullness of time an unimaginable
extension.”
Dr. Rowse opens-up this wonderful
period from a new and absorbing
viewpoint He is concerned less with
retelling the stories of Humphrey
Gilbert, Drake and Ralegh than with
showing what went on behind them at
home—the part the Queen herself
played in the English approach to the
New World through the conflict with
Spain, her deep personal interest in it
and the men who dreamed about, advo-
cated, planned and made the voyages.
He is concerned especially with the
dreamers and advocates and planners
—with the visionary and erratic mathe-
matician and cosmographer John Dee,
with the historian - propagandist
Hakluyt and with those two tireless
and brilliant planners Sir Thomas
Smythe, of the Virginia Company, and
Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who spent the
best part of a lifetime pushing a
ground-plan of the New England
settlement through a discouraging maze
of financial and political difficulties.
One by one these and many other
typical Elizabethans spring to life with
a fitting sweep and depth in Dr.
Rowse’s pages, and over their shoulders
we see the colonies proceed “under a
characteristically mixed English form
of enterprise, with private and public
elements, and the Crown making a
quasi-official contribution.” Thus the
distinctly Elizabethan element in the
Virginia and Massachusetts settlements
emerges strongly, persisting through the
shifts of politics and luck right up into
the 1640'5, when the colony’s early
waverings had steadied and its direction
become dear.
We see. too. the essential differences
of character between the two settle-
ments —differences which remained for
many years. Virginia, controlled at
first by a company of West Country
knights and London merchants and
later by the Crown, was “an extrapola-
tion of normal Elizabethan society.”
New England, with its governing
minority of Pilgrim and Puritan
reformists seeking escape from High
Church authority at home, was
“dominantly an extrapolation of the
Opposition.” 1
The Puritans were far more import-
ant than the Pilgrims in shaping the
later character of the colony," and
Rowse’s best chapter is about their
relationship. The Pilgrim Fathers were
“self-effacing exiles who only wanted
to escape attention to worship in their
own way.” No doubt that is why
American legend chose them as the
founders; they were much nicer than
the Puritans, who were clearly “goin»
forth to convert others to their way
and impose it on others, so far as they
could.” Although a minority, the
Puritans, because they knew what they
wanted in the new country (separation
from a Church they considered
“papist”), were able to impose their
character on the rest of New England.
It is this character-high-minded,
moralising, isolationist, yet with a sense
of mission—which persists as an
important part of the American
character, political and moral, to the
present day. And as early as the
1630’5. in the dispute over uniformity
of religion and the authority of the
new Church in government. John
Cotton (for) and Roger Williams
(against) cast the first shadows of the
Republican and Democrat parties and
the peculiar American dichotomy in
regard to the uses of authority which
still shows itself from time to time.
But, as Rowse capably shows, even
the early Puritan leaders were men of
the 16th rather than of the 17th
century. Bom in the 1580’s and early
’nineties, they took most of their
religious thought from the 16th-
century Protestant reformers. Their
conception of society as consisting
necessarily of a hierarchy (themselves)
and lower orders, ail ordained by God.
was authoritarian in the clearest
Elizabethan way. Their sense of
mission—of putting received ideas of
reform into action —was there from the
start, and it is what marks them oft
from the society they left behind; but
the concept of democracy did not come
till much later.
Dr. Rowse’s final chapter on the
effect the American discoveries and
settlements made on the English
imagination in science, literature and
art is especially full of interest.
Colonisation gave an enormous thrust
to English navigation, geography, cos-
mography and the natural sciences
(chiefly botany and anthropology). Its
effect on English prose i$ monumental
in the work of Ralegh, Hakluyt, Smith
and Bacon. How deeply it struck into
the poetic mind is not so well known.
Dr. Rowse has traced many references
to it in Spenser. Drayton, Chapman,
Massinger, Middleton. Donne and, of
course, Shakspeare (he has much to

DEAR MRS. C.
[A Family Portrait]
Dear Mrs. C. of Newtown, how I’d have
loved you,
With your sweet , lined face and calmly
folded hands,
The ribboned cap as much a part of your
coiffure
As the roof is part of a house . . . But
your name surprises :
Cora, a word like a rock, and Rosetta,
harshly
Recalling headlands and hieroglyphs
rather than roses.
Your velvet dress spread amply over
yottr bosom.
You pose on your chair like a cloud at
rest on a hill,
Ignoring Time; yet you were frail and
human
As we are who follow. Only this picture
remains.
Inscribed by a daughter-in-law long
dead: “Dear
Mrs. C. of Newtown, a most lovable
woman."

Maryvale Mill, in Victoria’s rich Latrobe
Valley, is a key unit in the nation-wide opera-
tions of Australian Paper Manufacturers
Limited and Australia’s only kraft pulp and
paper mill.
It was believed that no satisfactory paper-
making pulp could be produced from Australia’s
native timbers but following pulping experi-
ments commenced in 1920, C.5.1.R.0. and
A.P.M. pioneered a process to manufacture
pulp from Eucalypts.
A pilot mill began producing at Maryvale in
December, 1937, at the rate of some 17 tons
a day. Today about 300 tons of kraft pulp
are produced daily.
To meet the rapidly growing demands of
A.P.M. for pulp-wood and to supplement
supplies available from State forests a subsidiary
company A.P.M. Forests Pty. Ltd. was
formed in 1951, charged with establishing and
maintaining eucalypt and pine forests.
A.P.M. Forests must look far into the future
to plan for an ever-increasing demand.
Every year millions of seedlings grown in
nurseries are planted, and, by sound harvesting
in State and A.P.M. forests, the company is
making sure that many more healthy seedlings
will establish themselves naturally.
Forestry development has now extended to
Queensland where new tree farms are being
established and maintained to supply A.P.M.’i
new Petrie Mill.

AFRICA AND THE WORLD
■JMOTHING could be more unfortu-
nate than the situation which has
developed over Algeria only a few
weeks before Khrushchev is to visit
France. From the point of view of
the West generally it was important
that there should be stability round
the Mediterranean on the threshold of
the Summit Conference.
De Gaulle himself apparently felt
this strongly. He decided to get rid of
a major bugbear in policy, which the
Communists could use for agitation
during and after the Khrushchev visit,
by sacking General Massu, whose
followers were getting ready to hold
the Government to ransom in the
Summit Conference period.
Though its population is only half
that of Europe and a seventh that of
Asia (which holds more than half the
world’s peoples), more noise comes out
of Africa than the rest of the world
put together.
In the extreme south a dour and
tight - lipped, God - fearing white
minority, fanatic about the color-line,
is beating its punch-drunk head against
a stone wall of black opposition, parts
of it lashed to fury or surliness by the
incessant hammering into its half-
civilised brain of Communist slogans.
At the northern side of the continent
the Algerian conflict has the same basic
element of differences between colon-
isers and colonised, but conditioned
by different racial factors and tempera-
ments.
Algeria is a country of immense
strategic importance in the defence of
Europe, as World War II made clear.
It occupies a flank position very much
in the same relationship to France and
Italy as Australia holds in relation to
South-east Asian countries. This has
been true throughout history from the
days of Carthage, but it was never
more true than today.
The French ended Turkish rule—-
if rule it could be called, since the
coastline was crowded with the nests
of pirates and corsairs—in 1830. They
had years of war on their hands before
Algeria was subdued in 1847. For
the next four decades, intermittently,
France tried to swallow and digest
Algeria whole, but the Moslem popu-
lation refused to be swallowed.
World War II made a break in a
policy which was gradually becoming
stabilised. The modern Algeria has
been part of metropolitan France,
represented in its National Assembly,
a military district of France with all
inhabitants, native or immigrant,
subject to French conscription-laws
and the Delegate-General subject to
the Prime Minister, and exercising full
civil and military powers. All citizens,
including Moslem women, are now
electors. It has 66 deputies in the
Assembly. It has its own county
councils for which elections are to be
held later this year, producing some-
thing more than normal excitement.
"CROM 1955 onwards there has been
-*■ terrorism and rebellion in Algiers,
and it has needed a huge French Army
to keep the place under some sort of
control. Its politics, and the politics
of France, have largely been deter-
mined by the issue of independence,
or rather of no independence: for the
European section, determined at any
price to remain part of France, is
more militant and dangerous than the
fanatic followers of Koran.
Relationships are especially exacer-
bated by the dual standards of living
and welfare that exist, and though all
are technically equal before the law
and the Constitution, the gap between
the races and religions is illustrated
by the fact that the crude birthrate
of Europeans was only 18.7, against
39.8 for Moslems, while the crude
deathrate for Europeans is only 8.8,
against the Moslem rate of 12.8 (the
infantile mortality rate of Europeans
being 53 and of the Moslems 83 per
thousand for the last year for which
figures are available).
The advent of General de Gaulle to
power had its kernel in a confusion
which threatened to plunge France in
civil war over the Algerian issue. It
was the harder to handle since, were
it not for the occupying French Army,
the 86 per cent. Berber-Arab popula-
tion could swallow the rest at a bite.
The Communists have given as much
cunning and effort to the subversion
of the Moslem population of North
Africa as they have found it possible
to do, since a linkage of the rest of
the North African countries to a
Communist-influenced or -controlled
Arab Federal Republic, with a Com-
munist Germany or even East
Germany, would mean virtually the
encasement of Western Europe and
control of its sea-routes both to the
East and round Africa to Australia.
France and other Western countries
would be in the jaws of a Communist
world.
It is somewhat a paradox that de
Gaulle, who was sent into power
because the extremist Right believed
that he could save Algeria as part of
France, is now meat for rebellion
because of his “liberality” of outlook
towards self-determination.
While he is committed to pacifica-
tion, he is also committed to a long-
term policy of Constitutional adjust-
ment and determined not to plunge
precipitately into any course which
might lead to his having to meet a
specific challenge.
He was due to go to Algeria on
February 5 determined to explore the
situation for himself; but apparently
felt that General Massu, who had
become the symbol of the colonial will
to retain Algiers as a French de facto
province, might be likely to present
him with some sort of fait accompli,
or at least with a situation that Would
embarrass him in dealing with Moscow
and his Allies.
His dismissal of Massu and his
determination to be master of the
situation has sparked-off something
like a revolution which would be
serious indeed if the whole of the
Army in Algeria were of the same
mind as a section of high officers and
reservists stationed there.
l '~pHE affair seems to have developed
A into an incipient revolt of European
colonists whose stand for retention of
the area by France has been
strengthened by the discoveries of oil
in the Sahara and by the nuclear
activities there.
De Gaulle has the support of the
bulk of Frenchmen. Curiously, the
Left-wing now looks on him cynically
as its Red Hope after having held
him up for years as the devilish No. 1
opponent of Communist humani-
tarianism. But, as has been demon-
strated by the nature of the outbreak
and the events connected with the
hurried visit of M. Debre, the Prime
Minister, to Algeria, he is faced with
determined rebellion and with the possi-
bility that to use the Army to quell it
might lead to mutiny of the Territorial
section of it. His speech over the
weekend showed him firm.
The old adage that whom the gods
would destroy they first make mad
seems to apply to the Right-wing in
Algeria at the moment. The pity is
that the risk of destruction inherent
in chaos in France over any question
is not confined to France.
Her Allies and Nato might well be
destroyed as a consequence of French
civil war if the Kremlin decided to
take advantage of the chaos generated
by it and by the ascendancy of the
Left-wing in France produced by such
an issue.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Nuclear Co-operation
The great changes in atomic-develop-
ment plans which have come about in
the past five years are marked by the
announcement that the United States will
now, under agreement with Vickers-
Armstrong, build and sell in the U.K.
two models of an atomic reactor of the
type known as Triga, which operates
up to IOOKw, at a price around £lOO,OOO
sterling.
The reactor is not, of course, a com-
mercial plant, but is described as a
“complete package training research-
unit which could be used from sixth-
form grammar-schools up to a research-
reactor in universities.”
Vickers gave out as the reason for
their agreement the fact that they “had
set out to cover a complete range of
training and research facilities, and had
developed, and had on sale, a reactor-
simulator,” but they needed the Triga,
which they consider the best research-
reactor in the world —it is produced by
the General Dynamics Corporation in
the United States —to fill a gap in their
own range.
It would be interesting to know what
has been done in Australia about nuclear
training, apart from the installation of
research-plants such as that at the
National University in Canberra, the
Messel clinic and the one in the
Sutherland area of Sydney. The facilities
are obviously limited.'
It seems, in view of the enormous
importance of nuclear power to Aus-
tralia (which is at present sending its
nuclear fuels abroad, together with some
of the best brains in the nuclear field),
that proper steps should be taken to
equip at least the various universities
and to develop basic training-units at
some schools.
The kind of co-operation with other
English-speaking peoples which has
become possible now that the Americans
have realised that they are at least not
in advance of British nuclear science
is the first great step to a new era.
The U.S. has a good deal to learn,
especially on the industrial side, from
the U.K. research-schools, which were
the real mothers of the atomic age—
it was Lord Rutherford, a New
Zealander, who first, split the atom. A
great deal of the know-how which pro-
duced the first atomic bomb certainly
came from Cambridge, even if the pro-
duction of the weapon was beyond the
engineering resources of a Britain
plunged three-years-deep in war and
defence when the need came.
For years the Americans have refused
to share their techniques, but the
Russian advances and the optical
evidences of British advancement seen
in the industrial power-stations of the
United Kingdom have broken-down the
barrier.
As a result of the U.S. change in
attitude the British and United States
Governments now have a plan for joint
cosmic-ray measurements and radiation
studies.
It seems that the rockets will be
designed and provided by the Americans
and the satellites by the British, whose
team are Professor Massey, an Aus-
tralian, Quain Professor of Physics at
University College, London, and chair-
man of the British Committee of Space
Research; Professor A. P. Willmore,
Professor of Physics at the same college ;
and Dr. Elliott, of the Imperial College,
London.
The work will be carried out at Uni-
versity College, London ; and Birming-
ham University, where Professor Oli-
phant, head of the Nuclear Physics
Department at the National University,
Canberra, was once a teacher.
In view of the work being done at
Canberra and in Sydney, particularly in
the field of cosmic-ray research, it seems
that the time is ripe for the Common-
wealth to be brigaded into some massive
all-round research-programme. Such a
step would put and keep the English-
speaking peoples in the lead in nuclear
knowledge and its application to the
everyday life of the new age and provide
skilled workers for the purpose.
Butter and Margarine
The dairying industry is up in arms
over a suggestion by two economists
that the subsidy on Australian butter and
cheese should be abolished. And a
further recommendation that import-
controls be lifted and all restrictions be
taken from, margarine raised an even
bigger storm.
The economists are Prof. R. I. Down-
ing, Dean of the Commerce Faculty,
Melbourne University, and Prof. P. H.
Karmel, Professor of Economics at
Adelaide University. Their opinion was
sought by the Dairy Industry Committee
of Inquiry, which has been holding
sittings in Melbourne.
To replace the subsidy, the economists
suggested an Australian butter price
fixed on the basis of overseas prices—
the price if butter were imported. They
said this would still give the industry
overall protection equal to 15 p.c. to
18 p.c. when the British price was 300 s.
a hundredweight.
The acting-director of State Agricul-
ture, F. M. Read, was the first to hit
back. He said lifting controls could
jeopardise the prosperity of Australia’s
valuable butter industry. He added that
all Australian Governments had well
established by agreement that Australia
had such a big stake in the butter in-
dustry that there should be a very
definite control on the use of dairy sub-
stitutes such as margarine.
The chairman of the Victorian dairy-
ing section of the Australian Primary
Producers Union, A. A. Holte, described
suggestions in the report that butter
could be sold in Australia at world
parity as “fantastically stupid.”
And the Victorian representative of
the Table Margarine Manufacturers’
-Ascaniatinn G S Mr.Nallv. admitted:
ing-man’s table if margarine production
was not controlled.”
Strange Leakage
It would be difficult to find a parallel in
the history of the British Commonwealth
for the present proceedings connected
with the appointment of a N.S.W. Chief
Justice (and Lieutenant-Governor).
The N.S.W. Cabinet appears to be
divided about half-and-half ; but Cabi-
nets often are. The strange thing about
the situation is that on the morning after
its meeting last week, the news-
papers generally should have known
about the division in Cabinet, and who
was for and against. If ever there should
be secrecy in Cabinet about its divi-
sions, it should be in relation to appoint-
ments of this kind, in which the appointee
should never know who his supporters
are. Yet somebody let out the facts.
The second strange thing is that
although such appointments are in-
variably recommended by the law-officer
of the Cabinet (the Attorney-General,
Mr. Downing, who is supposed to make
it on merit), this time the Premier seems
to have been in favor of Dr. Evatt
against the Opposition of the Attorney-
General, who presumably has other
nominees in mind.
Otherwise the division seems to be
strongly sectarian, which appears to
introduce another complication in which
any candidate with a sense of his own
dignity and of the needs of the adminis-
tration of justice would wish not to be
involved.
The Premier made light of the dis-
cussion, and in fact suggested that there
had been none at all—-that the Cabinet
devoted itself entirely to its legislative
programme.
However, there certainly was debate
and difference about the merits (or
something) of the one lawyer put for-
ward (Dr. Evatt), and it seemed to be
indicated that the appointment, if it
were made this week, would be pushed
through by the votes of two sick Minis-
ters —one whose career appears to be
completely at an end through illness,
and the other in hospital to undergo
a major operation which will keep him
immobilised for some time. That is if
some Ministers opposed to the choice do
not change their minds.
A great lawyer would hardly be
flattered by receiving office in such a
manner, especially against the opposi-
tion of the Attorney-General, through
whom he will carry on his direct rela-
tionship with the Government.
He should be even less flattered to
discover that it is being generally said
that it was not the legal profession,
official or otherwise, that put him for-
ward, but the A.L.P. Executive, which
is determined to get rid of him as leader
of the Federal Opposition and has
ordered the Government to appoint him.
Choice by a bunch of behind-the-
scenes union-secretaries and others, who
at times show a very poor respect for the


courts, is even more degrading than
choice by a lay majority in a Cabinet.
Altogether it seems to be a sordid
business, and one might have expected
that Dr. Evatt would hasten to remove
his corpus, political or juristic, from the
Cabinet arena. Perhaps he will refuse
the office if it is proffered to him, though
all the signs suggest that he has already
expressed his willingness to take it.
If he is appointed it will not say much
for the Bar Council if it does not make
a strong and dignified protest. Irrespec-
tive of the merit or otherwise of the
appointee, the whole of the proceedings
are shocking and disgraceful to the
Cabinet and call for protests both from
the lawyers and from the public.
It would be unthinkable anywhere
among British communities outside N.S.W.
that the name of a candidate for the
highest judicial position in the State
should be bandied about and smeared
before it is officially announced. The
Cabinet haggling conveys a strong
suspicion that the greatest merit of the
new Chief Justice in the eyes of those
who want his appointment is that he is
a political nuisance and hindrance to
the revival of Labor-party prestige and
that the only way to get rid of him is
to give him the highest judicial position
in New South Wales.
A Ludmayoral Garden-party
Melbourne’s Lord Mayor, Bernard
Evans—businessman, architect, builder
—is an enterprising fellow. For one
thing, he became Lord Mayor last year
although a lot of people once swore
that he’d never be the city’s No. 1 Citizen.
That was because a few years back
be bucked the long-ruling anti-Labor
Civic Group by seeking Labor-party
support to become Lord Mayor. But
he just couldn’t raise enough supporters.
And Frank Selleck (a member of the
board of the newly created Reserve
Bank) got the job—and consequently a
knighthood.
Despite the cries for revenge, Evans
kept on winning his seat in council elec-
tions (through a couple of bitter cam-
paigns, too) and by last year he was
forgiven. The Civic Group elected him
Lord Mayor. And all but his most bitter
opponents now agree that he’s done a
first-class job.
Now he’s embarking on a new project.
He’s decided to add a Lord Mayoral
garden-party to the list of big civic
functions that are held each year.
The reason no other Lord Mayor has
thought of a garden-party before is that
the Town Hall has no grounds. But
for Lord Mayor Evans that presents no
Problem. He’s going to hold his garden-
party in the beautiful and enormous
Fitzroy Gardens, which nudge the
eastern fringe of the city.
No date has yet been fixed for the
garden-party, but Evans says he will
concentrate on the young in sending-out
invitations.
Despite his enterprise, the Lord Mayor
wilj__need better luck with the weather
than Victoria’s Governor, Sir Dallas
Brooks, has had. Government House
garden-parties invariably end-up under
cover because of Melbourne’s unpre-
dictable climate.
But the problem with Fitzroy Gardens
is that, apart from a small conservatory,
there is nowhere to shelter from an
unexpected downpour.
The G.-G.
[From Canberra]
It was a sad Governor-General and
his wife who bade good-bye to Canberra
at the R.A.A.F. base at Fairbairn last
week on the first leg of their journey
home after almost seven years in the
vice-regal office.
No vice-regal couple have endeared
themselves so much to the Australian
people during their term here
Seemingly a little outspoken, maybe,
on his arrival here, Sir William quickly
grew to understand the Australian way
of life and how to handle Australians,
from the highest to the humblest. And
Australians appreciated him.
Lord Dunrossil, his successor, is start-
ing the job as G.-G. with a tremendous
handicap the tradition which Sir
William and Lady Slim have left behind
them.
If Lord Dunrossil and his wife can
carry out the office in the same manner
as the recently departed occupants of
Yarralumla, Australia will be very happy
with them indeed.
Heat and the Great Wens
Looking over 1960 newspaper-files a
century hence historical students will be
inclined to feel that Sydney was very
near the edge of nothingness during the
last week in January, 1960. But other
cities had it nearly, or quite, as hot; many
towns in the outback suffer worse every
year than Sydney suffered, and most of
them are full of flies, barcoo-rot, sandy-
blight, prickly heat, goannas, hawks,
scorpions, death-adders, dust and willy-
willies, plus hot beer and some other;
cosmic luxuries which Sydney is denied
in heatwaves.
They have no Sydney Harbor beaches,
1000-million-gallon-a-day water-supply or
air-conditioning, but some of them do
have bushfires. They have put up with
these conditions since the Year One from
Marble Bar to Doodlakine, from
Bedourie to Poonemerlarra Well, with
pride rather than masochism, and without
attracting the sympathy of anybody.
Indeed, it has been the boast of the
Australian Government propagandists in
London since the first of them went there
that the temperature of Marble Bar rises
to 112 degrees, and they seem to feel
that this fact must be something of an
attraction to immigrants.
As for the poor inferior peoples of
foreign parts, they go through worse
every year at the right season. When
jthe temperature of Baghdad in May
doesn’t reach 112°, the descendants of
Haroun A 1 Raschid shiver; when the
miserable Baluch on the high lands west
of the Sheikh Wazil Pass find that May
is passing without a single noonday blaze
of 125°, or even 130°, they put on their
woollens and blame the curses of the
Afghans for denying them the excuse to
go and sit in the shade of the local salt-
bush —which is bigger and drier than the
Australian saltbush —along with the
Russell’s viper.
It can surely be said that no heat-
wave has ever had the publicity or raised
so much press outcry as that which struck
Sydney.
The press daily trumpeted the tempera-
ture even before it eventuated. The few
deaths, amid a couple of million people,
some of which might have happened any-
how, were made to sound like whole-
sale slaughter. The beach promenades
were so thick with motor-cars in the
evening that it was almost impossible to
get to the water, and the water was so
thick with the half-naked that there was
scarcely room for the sea.
The wharfies naturally were too hot
to work even when allowed to have ten-
minutes’ spell at intervals of about a
quarter-of-an-hour during the day. The
policemen at some street-intersections
gave up and let the traffic run. The
front pages of some newspapers seemed
to have nothing on them that could be
read through the heat-haze save huge
figures.
Yet Sydney was helpless in the heat-
wave. Its anguish was that its popula-
tion is a huge, organised mass of
humanity drilled and disciplined by con-
vention and tied by regulation.
From the Mediterranean eastward of
Suez there is a proper regimen for deal-
ing with the heat, even though summer is
not always as hot as last week in Sydney.
First, shorts and shirt or nightgown.
Second, coolth at night obtained by
sleeping under the stars on the roof
with the storks, or anywhere except
between walls. Third, adjustment of
working-hours to avoid the extreme heat
of the day.
But conceive what would happen in
Sydney if revised hours were suddenly
imposed. The vast wen would explode
into chaos. Government regulations
would not permit the civil service to
work such hours. All the unions would
ask for treble-time for getting-up early
and double-time for the last hour during
which they were expected to go home in
the rising heat. Shopping of every kind,
restaurants, traffic, train timetables, would
all fall into the uttermost chaos.
As for dress, the millenium would be
just round the corner if hotels and
restaurants allowed customers to come
in shorts and shirts.
The big Australian cities have no
cause to complain about the effects of
heatwaves. They get all their rigidity of
habit merits.

'T'wo newsboys whose pitches are on
opposite corners of a busy Perth
street developed a sense of rivalry;
as identical posters were supplied to
each boy, they had to carry it on the
voices, often misconstruing the leading
news-items in a struggle for originality.
Then one boy hit on a gimmick which
earned him favorable comments from
regular patrons and added custom from
a section of home-goers to whom a few
seconds’ delay in the giving of change
meant missing evening trains: a metal
coin - dispenser strapped to his waist,
making the giving of change quicker
than hunting around in a bag for trey-
bits and odd silver buried under
hundreds of pennies. Realising his rival
had scored a valuable round, the second
boy had to think-up a counter-attack.
Inspiration came from Heaven—i.e., a
revivalist-meeting he had attended. Now
hurrying throngs smile to see a battery-
powered lapel-microphone poised like a
cobra a few inches from the boy’s lips.
Instead of wasting lung-power he speaks
the headlines into his mike, with gestures
in true Billy Graham fashion. —“C.A.L.”

She was asked to take a and in a
moment was handed a glass of liquid.
She sat for some time with the glass in
her hand, wondering. The chemist came

Madam,” said the chemist; “we thought
you meant a stimulant for your heart.”

VI/hen a searing nor’-wester was
shrivelling Sydney up at around
105 deg., and with most of the male
population walking the streets in shirt-
sleeves, one of the strangest figures was
that of a little old man —he’d be 88 if
he’s a day—who passed me on the
sunny side of George Street, stepping
it out none too leisurely. I'd have taped
him as one of these Oldest Practising
Solicitors ... He wore a hard-hitter
whose faint green patina bespoke its
great age. His ancient tight suit
was of heavy black serge, and his
neck was clamped in a vintage stiff-
batswing collar. The fashion-wheel
having turned full-circle, the kind of
peg-top strides he wore approximated
the mode prescribed now for the bodgies.
The coatless ones were mopping their
brows and cursing. By some strange
quirk the old boy looked the least in-
commoded of ’em all, choofing along as
if it were a brisk autumn day. I dunno
perhaps it was that being already
almost dehydrated he couldn’t get a
sweat up.—“ Bo.”

to the pram-wheeler is the distance. It
is often necessary for mothers of families
to shop in the town and they could
ride in comfort if Tassie would only do
what has been done in Perth for years:
hang the prams on hooks outside the

“O' Jai”: When I went to school in
the 20’s we were taught to write with
the pen held loosely between the thumb,
fore- and middle-fingers, the weight of
the hand resting on the little-finger. This
enabled the hand to glide effortlessly
across the page. In one of today’s glossy
magazines I noticed an elegantly-gloved
hand holding an equally elegant pen in
a vice-like grip, with the little - finger
tightly curled and the weight resting on
the outside of the hand. No, the caption
did not read: “How to get writer’s
cramp.” It read: “Only the best people

THE CITY
Here walked great men and women —■
the very stones
Are worn with the shuffle of endeavor.
With purpose came and went: iron ,
steel, cement,
Their monument.
Here walked the not-so-great, whose step
knew failure,
Who paid their bills —but seldom got
their value,
Saw never discount, dividend, nor
pension,
Yet uncomplainingly observed the strict
convention —
Walked with the green, but barely got in
motion,
Yet loved this city with a quiet devotion.
Here walked the eager young, impatient,
blind,
To all but the call of the blood that
surged within them,
All faces, one face; all clocks moving
to the enchanted hour,
The crowded streets an anonymous
rendezvous —
Each in his own way loved this city, too.
And here walked those who, coming
from afar ,
Saw the fine tree-lined streets, the sun-
swept sky,
But thought on other cities, knew again
The call of the Homeland, and the
distant hearth ;
Yet, feeling the sun’s warmth through
the open door,
Prayed that the tom roots might strike
once more.

not one of them bounced up to me. So
I just turned to a fellow who was all

“Macquarie”: Sometime during the
night I was awakened by tense activity
around what had been an empty bed
when I went to sleep. Behind the screen
I could make-out silhouettes of nurses
and the house-doctor. Something pretty
vital was going on. Gradually I sensed
the tension easing, and also picked-up
enough scraps of phrases to work things
out. The patient had taken a whacking
overdose of sleeping-pills. In the morn-
ing the screen was gone (sure sign of
crisis passed) and the patient was in the
condition of a happy drunk. The ward-
sister entered and was immediately hailed
in hearty, giggling greeting. She re-
sponded in the same vein, then asked
him if he knew where he was. “Course I
do,” he answered with expansive good-
humor ; “I’m in Auckland!” “I wish
you were,” said the sister. “I’ve always
wanted to go to New Zealand.”

see a bright lad like you wasting time
here. Why aren’t you ambitious enough
to look for a job with possibilities?”
Not smart enough to take the hint the
lad went on delivering parcels to the
wrong places, so, to shame him into
leaving, the boss engaged a new boy.
Instead of being depressed at the sight
of his succesor, Bill, all smiles, rang his
mother and said, “Gee, Mum, I just
couldn’t wait till I got home to tell you.
I’ve been promoted at work. They’ve

thing, and the young fellow standing on
the pavement beside her was patently
busting with pride. A couple of young
bloods turned their heads in passing,
looked back, and obviously exchanged
laudatory remarks about her. An older
man in a car slowed-down and leaned
right out of the window to get a good
eyeful. Scarcely had he driven on when
the crew-cutted occupant of a sports-car
braked, swivelled his neck in a 250-
degree turn, then emitted the most heart-
felt wolf-whistle I’ve ever heard. Did
the young fellow beside her do his lolly
at such flagrant admiration? Not a bit
of it; he fairly purred. Maybe that

it is still played by the Trocadero

Fixed is his gaze till by some magic spell
He hears the distant murmur, Ring, ring the

that rubbish cleaned-up,” said the new
owner proudly. “When they cleaned-up
the block they dumped everything round

back of the house. It was built right
across the block with minimum clearance
each side. The garage was at the front.
“How are you going to get it out?” he
asked. “And what happens when you
get a load of winter fuel?” There was
a heavy silence as the horrid fact dawned
on the owner that there was no access
to the backyard except by hand or
wheelbarrow. “I didn’t notice that on

absence of any chair or stool is no dis-
regard for the user’s comfort but con-
sonant with the Japanese view that a
telephoner in a slouching or lazy attitude
is discourteous to the telephoned. On
their films, a businessman who is
depicted telephoning at his desk sitting
upright is a man of rectitude, but let
him so engaged lean back, cigar in
mouth, and he is the type to take the
widows and orphans down properly. It

helpful to men —or can they? I read an
article in one giving useful advice to
wives. It pointed out that a husband’s
home should be his castle and that he
is a very important person who should
not be taken for granted. Requisites for
his comfort were a wardrobe of his
own, a reading-lamp of correct height
and brightness, a king size comfortable
chair for reading the newspaper, a settee
to allow the “work-weary spouse”
(husband) to relax, a writing-desk, an
cocktail-bar. The article impressed me

Never has an attempt been made to
drop the pilot in more awkward or
agonising circumstances.

Various Labor leaders from Calwell
downwards have deplored public discus-
sion of the appointment of the new Chief
Justice of N. S. Wales. What has really
upset them is that the public should have
learned of discussions which they wanted
to keep private.

During last week’s meeting of the
N. S. Wales Cabinet two top-ranking
Federal Labor men sat —one in his home
at Mosman and one in the Opposition-
leader’s room in the Commonwealth
Bank Building in Martin Place—waiting
for the word that would change the
status of both of ’em. It didn't come,
so they thrust their carefully prepared
impromptu statements back into their
desks, put on their hats and went off to
wait another week.

F. H. Campbell, president of the
Kingsgrove (N.S.W.) branch of the
A.L.P., has written to Sydney “Herald”
quoting various authorities (including the
“Herald” and the “Telegraph”) on the
merits of Dr. Evatt as a jurist and a
former Minister of External Affairs. The
quotes are from such widespread sources,
and cover such a long period, that it
seems obvious Bert lent Campbell his
famous book of press-clippings for the
purpose, with suitable passages promi-

Khrushchev will urge the 1,200,000

Khrush. demobilised them.

When the Westralian Parliament meets
again the Brand Government will find
its already slender majority skinnier
still. At the election last March the
Liberal and Country parties won 25
seats, Labor 23 and Independent Liberals
two. With the support of the Ind. Libs.
—W. Grayden (South Perth) and E. P.
Oldfield (Mt. Lawley)—David Brand was
able to command a majority after
appointing a Speaker. Last week Oldfield
announced that he had been admitted to
the Labor party, which means that the
Government will have a bare majority
of one on the floor of the House.
The immediate result of this is to place
in jeopardy the Government’s plan for a
redistribution of boundaries, increasing
the number of members to 51, by
creating an extra country seat. The bill
was shelved last year when sickness on
the Government side of the House made
it seem unlikely that the numbers could
be mustered to steer it through.
On the same day that Oldfield joined
the Westralian Labor party, the A.L.P.
lost by death P. R. Lawrence, its M.L.A.
for South Fremantle since 1951.
Lawrence was only 44 and his sudden
death was a shock to his colleagues.
Its effect on the party-strengths of the
Assembly will be only temporary, as
South Fremantle is a safe Labor seat.

After several witnesses (directors and
employees of News, Ltd.) in the Adelaide
Police Court hearing of libel charges
against News, Ltd., and Rohan Rivett,
editor-in-chief of the “News,” had
declined to answer questions on the
grounds that they might tend to
incriminate themselves, N. E. J. Sewell,
news-editor of the “News” was handed a
typed document which prosecuting coun-
sel told him was a free pardon authorised
by the Executive Council. After consul-
tation with his counsel Sewell said he
understood the document gave him a
free pardon for any participation he
might have had in any offence in connec-
tion with the charges before the court.
He then continued his evidence and said,
in reply to questions, that the poster
“Shand Quits. ‘You Won’t Give Stuart
Fair Go’ ” had been dictated to him by
Rivett; also the headlines “Mr. Shand,
Q.C., Indicts Sir Mellis Napier” and
“These Commissioners Cannot Do the
Job.”
Subsequently Rivett and News, Ltd.,
were committed for trial.

The parrot-cry that Australia is part
of Asia was raised again at the Summer
School of Political Science in Canberra,
when J. Wilkes said that this country
should break its traditional ties with both
Britain and the United States, throw
away its White Australia policy and take
its “rightful place” in a triangle “with
India as the apex, Africa on one side
and Australasia on the other.” This sort
of talk is considered by those who use
it to be realistic thinking. It is based
on maps and population statistics, and
makes no allowance for racial and cul-
tural factors which right down through
the ages have refused to be tied-down
by geographical fetters.

New Zealand should have its first
TV-station operating towards the end
of the year. The system will be State-
owned and controlled and will be asso-
ciated with the N.Z. Broadcasting Ser-
vice. Prime Minister Nash says the
first station at Auckland will be non-
commercial, but when sufficient viewers
are available commercial programmes
will be introduced. Later, stations will
be established at Wellington, Christ-
church and Dunedin. All will be Govern-
ment owned; private TV-stations will
not be permitted. Which means that
New Zealanders will have to watch
whichever Western the N.Z.B.S. gives
them instead of having their pick of two
or three.

It is strange that during Sydney’s heat-
wave there was not one suggestion that

Harold Holt had an exhibit at a

rather a curious one—was titled “Found,

Sydney magistrate A. E. Debenham
has been making a survey of the in-
fluence of drink in petty crime. Of 3146
“street offences” which came under his
notice at Redfern court last year only
41 defendants were not affected by
liquor, and in two years 95 per cent,
of all those convicted admitted being
affected by alcohol. “Street offences”
include drunkenness, offensive behavior,
indecent language, begging, assault and
resisting arrest. Debenham says he has
sat in almost every metropolitan court
and has found a similar state of affairs
in all of them.

Compulsory blood-tests for persons
suspected of drunken driving were under
discussion at a forum held at Sydney
University last week. Dr. Hansman, a
pathologist who is an executive of the
Road Safety Council, favored the tests,
which he said should not be regarded
as taking away a liberty but as taking
away from drunken drivers the right to
kill. He said the tests would not affect
moderate or mild drinkers with less than
.05 per cent, of alcohol in the blood-
stream. N. S. Wales Government
Analyst E. S. Ogg opposed the tests,
which he considered might bring suffer-
ing to innocent people. He claimed that
there were no definite figures to show
how alcohol impaired the ability to drive.
The Heffron Government proposes to
bring down a bill later in the year to
provide for blood-tests.

It is ironic that while the Eden
memoirs about Suez are being published,
Cuba, the tool in U.N. of American
policy at that time, is run by an adminis-
tration which has jeered-at and insulted
Washington. Uncle Sam has called
home his ambassador and is muttering
threats to make cuts in the sugar-import
quota. Castro’s reply is abusive, but it
needs only a push to send his rickety
economy tottering and to fling the
country into the hands of wafting Com-
munists who have been egging him on.

Although the Russians (or is it their

Vic. Cabinet will hold a meeting at
Mildura on March 7 —its first country
meeting this year. Ministers will leave
Melbourne by special train at night on
March 6, arriving in Mildura early the
following morning. Cabinet will meet
in the Town Hall at 9.15 a.m. and at
10.30 a.m. Ministers will be taken on
a tour of the city, and will be given a

The Mildura trip is part of Bolte’s

A facet of the need for Constitutional
reform is shown in the position of
registration of Australian shipping.
Officially, there is no such thing as an
Australian ship. All our vessels are on
British registry under the Merchant
Shipping Act of 1894. So far as the
Commonwealth is concerned this Act
ceased to have effect with the passage
of the Statute of Westminster. But it
still has effect in the States, which have
power over intra-State shipping. With
dual control of shipping by States and
Commonwealth, apart from this, two
captains who collide in harbor may
need to be dealt with separately one
(inter-State or overseas) by the Common-
wealth ; one (intra-State) by the State.

The Prime Minister has told the
Premiers he won't give the States more
money this year. With swiftly rising
costs and wages he no doubt feels that
his need is greater than theirs. The
Premiers are meditating whether to force
a special Loan Council meeting. The
alternative seems to be higher fares and
freights, with all the resulting spirals.
And if anybody has had spirals it’s the
owners of State railway and transport-
systems.

One of the Victorian Parliament’s few
remaining “characters” will be lost to
it at the end of the present Parliament.
This is Sir George Knox, L.C.P., mem-
ber for Scoresby, who has announced
his intention of retiring. He is the third
veteran State member in recent months
to make this decision. The others are
W. Ruthven, V.C. (Labor M.L.A. for
Reservoir), and F. Thomas (Labor
M.L.C. for Melbourne).
Sir George has been in the Assembly
since 1927 ; he was Speaker from 1942
to 1947. He served on Gallipoli and in
France and, in World War II rose to
Brigadier. During the past 10 years
Knox has been campaigning for simpler
language in Acts of Parliament. He
wants “language that dinkum Aussies
can understand,” but apart from promises
from several Ministers, his crusade hasn’t
got very far.

“Stromlo”: One of the tasks of foreign
and Commonwealth diplomatic missions
in this country is to tell Australians
something of their homelands. In this
respect the Indian High Commissioner’s
office is doing a fine job, and its most
recent publication, “India 1960” is an
excellent epitome of what was accom-
plished in the first Five Year Plan and
what is being done under the second
plan. High Commissioner Samar Sen
says the book outlines progress made in
industry and agriculture, the changing
pattern of Indian society, and something
of India’s efforts in other directions of
national reconstruction. One article of
major topical importance concerns the
Himalayan frontier, of which it declares
that “few, if-any, land frontiers in the
world can claim as strong a sanction
of long and unbroken tradition.” Peking
should read it.

The Prime Ministers’ Conference in
May will have one regrettable absentee.
Nigeria, most promising of the new
African nations, will not have its inde-
pendence till October. And it is a firm
rule with the supposedly rapacious
colonialists of the U.K. that new nations
cannot apply for membership of the
Commonwealth until their independence
is real. The Nigerians, whose representa-
tives so impressed their fellow-delegates
at the Canberra Parliamentary Confer-
ence in November, are quite hipped
about it.

“Ex-ACT” on the new Baron:
It has been my good fortune to have many
encounters with R. G. (now Lord) Casey, and
he’s always been courteous, and mostly helplul.
But my first meeting was outstanding.
There was a Loan Council meeting in Mel-
bourne in the time of the Lyons Ministry,
and even Albert Dunstan hadn’t given us
pressmen a news lead. The reporters who
walked down Bourke Street from Parliament
House at dinner-time were a doleful lot,
especially as Casey, then Federal Treasurer,
had evaded us by going out the back door.
The others went for a steak at the Greek’s, but
as my office was paying for the dinner I
decided to do it swell, and have a half-crown
meal at the Florentino, with wine!
As I sat down, I noticed Casey and his wife
a few tables away. When the coffee stage
approached, I scribbled a note asking Casey
if he could spare me a few minutes when
he’d finished dinner, slipped a waiter a couple
of bob and the note, and asked him to give
it to Casey.
A few moments later the Treasurer beckoned
me over, and asked me to sit down. When
I did, he held up a two-bob piece, and asked
why I’d sent it to him. I had presence of
mind enough to say that if I’d really wanted
a story I’d have made it five-bob. Then I
asked for the dope on the Loan Council.
He talked for a quarter of an hour, and I
went back to Parliament House rather pleased.
For the rest of the evening, while the other
chaps loitered about waiting for the Council
to rise, I wrote steadily on. They didn’t
believe I had anything, but next morning they
found I had.

“Yakipan”: Awarded the 0.8. E. at
the New Year, George Stanley Roberts,
manager of the Melbourne office of
the Tasmanian Tourist Department and
doyen of the industry in Melbourne,
will bow out this autumn. Born at
Ross (Tas.) he joined Tasmanian Rail-
ways in 1913 ; was chosen one of the
two men to organise the Tourist Bureau,
and since then has seen that two-man
office develop into one of Tassie’s
most important—and prosperous—in-
dustries. He served in the old 9th
Battery, Field Artillery, during War I,
was on Gallipoli just after his 18th birth-
day and later in France. After the war
he stayed on for a while at Australia
House, London. Home again, he rejoined
the Tourist Department and therein has
served the Speck in Brisbane and Sydney
as well as in Melbourne.
As an officer of the Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics J. H. (Jack) Kelly has
carried-out surveys to examine the poten-
tial of the beef-cattle industry that have
taken him to the farthest corners of the
Northern Territory. He has yarned with
all types of personalities connected with
the industry, from qualified stockmen to
heads of companies, in his search to find
out what can be done to build up herds
in quality and numbers sufficient to
satisfy the still-growing demand for beef
here and abroad. His reports have
CATTLE
spurred Governments to consider im-
provements to communication and trans-
port.
Also, he knows a fair bit about such
sidelines as rice and wine, and the artist
who made the accompanying sketch of
him testifies that he’s a first-rate cook.
In the last war Jack Kelly started in
the R.A.A.F. and later transferred to
the Army as a captain, knocking-off an
imposing belly-fa9ade to make the grade.
The artist, burdened at that time with
two hooks on his sleeve, recalls being
bidden by Captain Kelly to join him
and a clarinet-playing major in the
requiem for an outsize snapper. He
reports: “With appropriate vino, Bach
and jazz from the reed, cooking would
be a poor word to describe the per-
formance Kelly conducted. Never was
such a fish!”

Lost to human ken when the Heron
aircraft in which he was travelling on
a consulting job to Portuguese Timor
disappeared in violent weather after
leaving Darwin, Launcelot (“Taffy”)
Owen was well-known to all those who
followed his oil-exploration comments
in The Bulletin. He was an outspoken
commentator all his life on anything he
really wanted to speak about—whether
it was the oil game, wine, the Arabs or
booby-traps, of which he had an intimate
knowledge in both World Wars. Born
a Welshman, he learned to speak English
as a foreign language at the age of six,
and was inclined to think in Spanish.
He also understood Arabic—and Arabs,
one of his sorer subjects after his sojourn
on the Arabian oilfields. He studied
under Professor Watts at the Imperial
College of Science and Technology,
London, took his A.R.S.M. in Geology
and Technology of Oil after graduating
in chemistry ; then, after two years in
the field in South America, took his
D.I.C. for geological research. After that
he did geological exploration in most
of the uncivilised parts of the world
and came to Australia in 1937, at the
request of the Commonwealth Oil
Advisory Committee, as oil-geologist to
Papuan Apinaipi Petroleum. He left
Papinaipi in 1940. After his service in
World War II he took on a job with the
Standards Association, from which he
retired only last year. He was also Aus-
tralian correspondent of the “Petroleum
Times,” London. “Taffy” Owen lived with
enthusiasm and gusto, and it was in that
spirit, at the age of 70, that he set out
on his last assignment to solve the prob-
lem of migrated oil for Timor Oil, Ltd.

“G.N.W.”: Few men have given more
diversified service in peace and war than
Richard Gardiner Casey, C.H., D. 5.0.,
M.C., 8.A., who has been raised to the
peerage in his 70th year.
Trained as an engineer at Cambridge,
he graduated with an honors degree in
mechanical science and served through
War I, finishing as a major ; then worked
with mining and engineering companies
until 1924.
In the 35 years since then he has been
just about everything U.K. Minister
of State in the Middle East, member of
the War Cabinet, Governor of Bengal,
Minister Plenipotentiary to the U.S.A.,
Federal Treasurer and Minister for
External Affairs, to mention just a few
of his jobs. He is not (as has been stated)


the fourth, or even the fifth, Australian
to be raised to the peerage. In addition
to the names currently quoted there have
been three others —the present Baron
Huntingfield and the late Baron Atkin,
another life-peer, who were both born in
Queensland, and Baron Hankey, who
was born in South Australia. Lord
Casey’s peerage should specially please
Melbourne Grammar—it makes the
school’s hat-trick! Three Australian-
born peers now on deck, Lords Bruce,
Baillieu and Casey, received their Aus-
tralian education there.

Charlie Bignell (of the accompany-
ing sketch) has crowded an interesting
lot of roving into his 68 summers. Born
at Dungog (N.S.W.), he ran away to sea
at the age of 12 ; sailed as cabin-boy
in the barque Galgate for South
America, then on to the U.K. and
Europe. Coming back round the Cape,
he arrived home a veteran of 15. His
next stop was the New Hebrides ; then
he moved on to the Solomons, where he
got a job on a plantation (the overseer
had been killed by Malaita natives
shortly before). The master of the re-
cruiting-schooner also met a sticky end
around Malaita, so Bignell took-over
command of the ship for a while. Next
he built-up a plantation of his own on
Ysabel, meanwhile owning various small
ships which he used for recruiting and
trade.
While he was away at sea his wife
ran the plantation and brought-up the
children. Later, in the 1937 eruption
at Rabaul, where she was running the
hotel, Kathleen Bignell’s heroism was
rewarded with an M.8.E., and she was
made an 0.8. E. after War 11, in which
SHIPS
she was captured by the Japs and taken
to Tokyo.
In that war Charlie Bignell started as
a coastwatcher, with a radio established
on the mountains of Ysabel, until ordered
to sail with 30 evacuees from the Solo-
mons to Vila. From then on he was
put in command of various small ships
around the New Hebrides, New Guinea
and the Philippines. The war lost him all
his assets, and there wasn’t any com
pensation, so he went to New Guinea
afterwards as captain of small ships,
first for the Government, then for Burns,
Philp. His last ship was the Kokoda,
but he's now left New Guinea and is
shipkeeping for Burns, Philp in Sydney.

“J. 8.”: For a city of its size Sydney
is strangely lacking in what might be
termed personalities. In Frank Johnson,
publisher, it has lost one of the few.
The literary will remember him as the
founder, with Jack Lindsay and Ken-
neth Slessor, of “Vision” (which briefly
in the years shortly after the First War
gave scope for some bright new writing
- and criticism) and as publishing Slessor,
Douglas Stewart and Kenneth Mackenzie
in the field of poetry, and a whole host
of others known and unknown in the
fields of fiction and humor. Musicians
and the music-trade, and the entertain-
ment world generally, will remember
“Tempo,” which he brought into life
and nourished through the vicissitudes
of some 25 years. Old Diggers of the
36th Battalion will remember the youth-
ful stretcher-bearer who saw it through
with them all the way, and the man who
for the past 10 years or so gave their
problems so much time as secretary of
the battalion’s association. Most who
knew him will remember the Frank of
the ready smile even when things were
not so good. He was 61 at the finish ;
he had been a mere 16 when he sailed
for that First War.

Just landed from Texas (U.S.A.) in
search of the dinkum oil, Jerald Howard
(Jerry) Bartley called at The Bulletin
on one of the hottest days of last week
and said the climate reminded him of
home. Nice place, Midland, apparently
—or very polite visitor.
Here pictured, Bartley is a director
and chief geologist to the Texas Ameri-
can Oil Corporation in those mild
regions around that home-town of his.
Also a member of the American Associa-
tion of Petroleum Geologists and of the
Society of Economic Paleontologists and
Mineralogists, the Geological Society of
America and the American Institute
OIL
of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers,
he’s been in the oil game all his working-
life, except when he took time off during
War II to serve in the U.S. Navy, first
as a gunnery-officer in the Atlantic and
later with amphibious forces in the
Pacific.
When he graduated in geology from
the University of Texas he was taken-on
as senior geologist by the Texas Univer-
sity Lands. In 1938, when he went to
that post with the University, there were
11 oilfields, with a total of 697 wells
and £35 million in the endowment-fund.
When he left in 1950 there were 53
producing oilfields, with 2054 wells and
£lOO million in the endowment-fund
kitty. He was here last week on his way
to make a preliminary survey of oil
prospects in the Broken Hill area and
the west of N.S.W. He shouldn’t be
homesick out there.

One of the happiest memories of his stay in
Australia, was a visit to Norman Lindsay’s

ABORIGINALITIES
Report that the inhabitants of Tennant
Creek (N.T.) have been paying Bs.
a gallon for water hauled from a well
seven miles away recalls that the site
originally chosen for a settlement was
near that same well. It happened,
though, that the first beer-wagon due
on the site broke-down at that spot, seven
miles from it, whereupon the populace
up-anchored and established the settle-
ment around the derelict. When, later, a
dam was built there, it was two years
before the hole was full enough to be
reticulated. Then, on the night before
the official opening, a customer bet a
barmaid he could swim from one side
to the other. .He lost his bet, and it was
not till a few days later that his body
was recovered. The dam was drained,
undrunk! —“Geep.”

“Briars”: The kids straddling the fence
between the Members’ and the Public at
the country race-meeting were not only
a nuisance, with their dropped orange-
peelings, empty sweets-cartons and dis-
carded ice-cream containers, but also
an eye-opener. Idly listening to their
chatter between races, I was amused to
think that they were playing at betting,
until I found that it was no play but
that they were actually placing bets. My
modest shared-bet of ss. for a place
looked silly beside the ten-bob and a
quid they were giving a 16-to-20-year-
old youth, who was placing the bet for
them —and then collecting a percentage
of the winnings. One 10-year-old re-
marked that he’d “done seven quid,”
while another swore luridly at the
“ donkey” who didn’t get a place.
Where do youngsters get the money to
bet like that, and why do parents make
it possible for them to do so?

“Croajingolong”: A truckie in our
town was carting timber for the. Youth
Club free of charge. As he crossed the
main street he interrupted the course
of a utility which came around the
corner much too fast, and had to brake
suddenly. Sticking his head out the
window the ute-driver called out, “Who
gave you your b licence?” “I did!”
roared the town sarge as he climbed
down from the passenger-seat of the
truck in full regalia.
“ Yair, there s fights every day in this bar."
“Rangitaiki”: In a new Hall of
Navigation at Auckland (N.Z.) Museum
a mural will picture the whole Pacific
area, aiming at showing every island,
with examples of each island group’s
art, N.Z. being represented by a painting
of ancient Maori carving. The central
exhibit will be a Solomon Island ocean-
going canoe. The director of the
museum, Dr. Gilbert Archey, says that
some Solomon Island sailors visited the
museum and, back home, told their chief
they had seen his son, Rakai Tonga,
in Auckland, and that he was well.
“Rakai Tonga” is their name for this
canoe, and although about 400 years old
it is still remembered as part of the
family. It has been on exhibition in
Auckland for more than 40 years.

“Miss M”: It’s a pity the golf-buggy
has displaced the caddy, as this is a
profession for which black brother is
specially equipped. In the war-time
Northern Territory there was a dearth
of golfing-equipment, but we Old Grey
Mares practised driving off an impro-
vised tee with hockey-sticks and tennis-
balls. The driven ball instantly vanished
into a solid wall of 6ft.-high grass, where
we would never have even tried to find
it; but our Bathurst and Melville
Islanders never needed urging to leave
their work and caddy for us. They
would slide through the stems and return
with the ball as quickly as if it had
been lying on a fairway in plain view—
and all for the amusement we caused
them. Show me a buggy that will beat

he was actually soothing his tonsils with

V. planifolia steeped in cashew-nut oil,
then macerated in rectified spirit over
a leisurely period, and the filtered
liquor then went into the bottle for the
delight of the Edwardian housewife.

THE SLEEPING BUSH
The chattering creek, the continual
“hush” of the distant waterfall,
l heard when l looked out into the night.
The glim of fronds and blades in the light
of the moon, the forms of crouching
boulders,
the gums with dark hair over their
shoulders,
I saw as I stood outside my j tent,
believing that night was almost spent.
No tenuous sound of the robin’s song,
forerunner of all the myriad throng
of the birds at dawn, in the stillness
stirred.
Only the water’s sound I heard
as I stood there . wondering by what track
had I come, to find myself gone back
to a time and place, with the rocks and
trees,
deep in the silent centuries.

tious to concoct ice-cream like mother
used to make, illegally wangle some
absolute alcohol and bottle vanilla-pods
therein for six months. Commercial ice-
cream-makers are coy about the bases
of their vanilla-flavors, and if my taste-

“Must you keep showing-off by grinding your teeth ?”
“false boils” and “real boils”; but he
missed the point I was making. The
hotter water is when poured on the
leaves, the better tea it makes ; when
the jug boils, ihe switch has to be turned
off and the lead removed before the
water can be poured ; in this time the
water must drop in temperature. If
“Theo D. Lite” disputes that, I can only
conclude that he is an electric-jug sales-
man.

that’s the most popular pronunciation ;
but I know how hard it is to put native
pronunciation down in English, so when
the operator set it as “kadjuputs” I let
it go and left it to the author. He put it
up to the Forests Department, which
came up with “cajeput” as the official
-spelling. Since then I’ve seen “kadjiput”
in a recent novel.

THE OLD LOONGANA
'T'he Princess of Tasmania, now on the
Port Melbourne-Devonport run, is
a wonderful vessel and I wish her luck;
but, as one who served as third-, second-
and first-officer in the old Loongana and
did over 700 trips across Bass Strait
in her, let me put a word in for the
old girl.
For eight months of the year we
really earned our pay (the other four,
being winter, were easier). Sailing from
the Queen’s Wharf —up the Yarra—
about 4 p.m., we would berth at Laun-
ceston about 7 a.m. next day. Doing
four trips a week, Sunday was the only
night we had in port.
Our average speed for the month was
about 18 knots, though we often
averaged 18.5 knots a trip. Best run
while I was in the Loongana was 20.1
from Low Head to Port Phillip Heads,
with 19.6 from wharf to wharf. When
the Mount Lyell mine was on fire we
carried lifesaving-equipment to Burnie
and did over 21 knots for part of the
trip, and again when the German raider
Wolf nearly cut us off in Bass Strait
we hit 21.5. For those occasions stoke-
hold-hands (32) and engineers (6) were
all on duty. Even the new Princess would
have to put on her best dress to equal
that!
While serving in the Loongana I did
over 48,000 miles in Tassie’s River Tamar
alone. Each officer, as he left the bridge,
had to make the rounds of the ship and
record his report; the steward-depart-
ment kept men on “tap” all night; and
the purser did a great job. Lady
passengers were requested to go below
at 10 p.m. by our stewardesses (we
carried three), and the chief steward, the
late Mr. Bennet (known to thousands as
“Benno”) was a wonder on the job.
We carried 3000 to 4000 bags of mail
each trip and up to 400 passengers, all
bedded-down in comfortable cabins. No
sitting up all night, and in all my years
on board I never struck one whit of
passenger-trouble.
The “roll-on and roll-off” system for
cars being carried across the Straits in
the Princess is, of course, a wonderful
improvement on the old method of
handling; but, even at that, we were
able to land a car every four minutes.
So I “hoist me lid” to the Loongana
and her skipper for so many years, the
late Capt. Spring Brown.
As with many another coal-burner,
expenses of running the ship became
too great, and she finished-up in the
hands of Eastern owners.

Ships In Churches
By "C. CORAL"
Since the days when our
Lord taught and preached
from the boat of one of
His fishermen disciples
on the shore of the Sea of
Galilee, ships, the Church and
the ever-moving restless sea
have been associated in a sort
of mystic alliance all down the
Christian era. Biblical narra-
tive is rich in sea-lore. Among
the saints, Nicholas is the
patron saint of mariners ; he
has a ship, an anchor and a
model of a church as his
emblems.
In pagan times mariners
placed their vessels —very tiny
ones they often were —under
the protection of the gods.
Christian maritime com-
In the right background is the original font
in All Souls Quetta Memorial Cathedral —

standing in the bowl, a copper jug brought
up from the wreck of the Quetta. Present
font (foreground) is a memorial to the
Rev. V. Chalmers.
munities took over this natural
religious desire ; and in Corn-
wall, Brittany and elsewhere
people loved to gather, as they
have continued to do, for the
Church’s blessing of the waters
and of their fishing-craft.
Here in Australia over recent
years, from the islands off Cape
York and down the coasts to
Tasmania, there has been
interesting revival of the old
ceremonies of blessing in which
clergy and people invoked
God’s protection of sailors and
fishermen and all who “go
down to the sea in ships.”
Up in the picturesque Torres
Strait islands native drums
accompany the singing as the
colorful processions pass
beneath waving coconut-palms
along the white beach. Further
south, in European com-
munities, brass bands and
choirs may be on ship’s deck
or at the waterside assisting in
these sea - services. But
wherever it is, the same thought
is predominant.
Reminder of the sea enters
even into the design of church
The central part,
where the congregation sits, is
called the “nave,” coming
from the Latin word navis,
which means a ship. One sees
the simile as the eye follows
the contour of walls and
arched roof; if the building
could be gently turned upside
down, the roof-
tree would be-
come the ship’s
keel, with the
side of the hull
spreading out-
wards. There is
one good ex-
ample of this in
a delightful little
wooden church
in Tasmania at
a port from
which loads of
blackwood used
to be shipped ;
and the effect is
further height-
ened by pieces of
delicately carved
blackwood furn-
ishings shaped
by a man with
great love of the
sea in repre-
sentation o f
ship-parts.
In a number of churches,
particularly some in coastal
ports where the flag of the
“Flying Angel’s” Seamen’s
Mission operates, the pulpit is
shaped like a ship’s prow.
Ships’ flags, too, are hung from
the walls, or carried in pro-
cession for special services.
Often there may be a ship
painted on the wall over the
chancel arch, as in St. George’s
Church at Queenscliffe (Vic.),
or pictured in stained-glass
windows, such as may be seen
at the historic church at
Longford (Tas.). The
symbolism in this case is con-
nected with the idea of the
church as the ark of
salvation
HPerminology suggestive of
the sea occurs in various
other forms: for instance,
many churches have a “boat
boy,” the acolyte who carries
the brass boat-shaped vessel
containing the incense to be
placed as required in the censer.
Ship-models in full rig adorn
the interior of numerous
churches in Britain and on the
Continent and elsewhere.
Suspended from the ceiling,
or'hung in some other con-
spicuous position, they are
there as votive offerings, or
perhaps have been given as
memorials of vessels histori-
cally linked with the church
or place.
Portsmouth Church, in Eng-
land, has (or at any rate had
before the war) a model of the
well-known Mary Rose. The
dockyard church at Chatham
displays a lovely representation
of Drake’s famous Golden
Hind. Before the high altar
of St. James’ Church in
Southampton hangs a fine
model of the Royal Mail Com-
pany’s Arcadian ; it is about
lift, long and cost over £lOOO
to construct. The Church of
the Ascension, at Victoria
Docks, London, has four ships,
standing on window
ledges: two are sail-
ing-vessels, the others
are a hospital-ship
and a destroyer
made by a stoker
during war-time.
Similar offerings
find place in some of
our Australian
churches.
An unusual little
church in course
of construction by
the Anglican people
of Paynesville, a fish-
ing-port and holiday-
resort in Gippsland
(Vic.), expresses rela-
tionship between
Church and sea in a
number of interest-
ing features.
From an elevated
position looking
down over the sea a
large view-window
behind the altar
frames a wonderful
picture of water,
islands and sky.
Above the roof over
the altar a tower de-
signed in the form
Porthole from the Quetta,
brought up six years after the
wreck. It is encrusted with
coral, and a sponge has grown
on the corner. The relic is in a
glass case on one of the walls
of the Quetta Memorial
Cathedral at Thursday Island.
of a lighthouse emphasises
the part the sea and lakes
play in the life of the
community, and symbolises the
Church’s work in sending out
the Gospel as a beam of light
from the shadow of the cross
surmounting the tower. A
light within the aluminium
openwork latticed framing of
the “lantern” gives reminder
of Christ the Light of the
World. An inverted ship’s bell
set in a dignified base will serve
as font; a ship’s lantern will
hang in the sanctuary, and the
pulpit is being styled after the
prow of a boat.

CREATING CAPITAL AND PRODUCTIVITY
'T'he increase of 28 p.c. in
wage-margins within the
metalworking industry will not
take long to percolate through
the whole economy; and,
following the 155.-a-week
increase in the Federal basic
wage in June, its effect on the
Australian costs-structure will
be very evident.
The only anti-inflationary
answer to higher money-wages
is higher productivity; and,
whilst greater productivity has
been achieved in most indus-
tries over the past 10 years, it
has by no means kept pace with
the growth in money-wages.
Hence a rate of inflation that
is now re-emerging from the
“creeping” stage.
In our overseas trading the
effect of increased costs has
been masked somewhat by the
influx of capital, which has
turned minor or adverse
balances-of-trade into much
more favorable balances-of-
payments. But the increase of
overseas debt or overseas equity
obligations naturally carries a
sting in its tail.
It has been only during the
past three years that manu-
facturing productivity (on a
man-week basis) has overtaken
the setback caused by the intro-
duction of the 40-hour week in
1948. In the transport' indus-
tries, of course, there has never
been any sign of the 10 p.c
working-time lost through the
introduction of the 40-hour
week being offset by increased
speed and efficiency of services.
With the exception of diesel
services, the railways seem to
be run at a slower rate than
ever, and -metropolitan road-
transport is certainly slower
because of congestion.
With long-service leave,
increased annual holidays, and
increasing number of public
holidays, smoke-ohs, time
allowed for signing-on and
knocking-off, etc., the average
Australian worker, eVen when
subject to a time-clock, does
not work a 35-hour week.
With high wages and a high
rate of consumption by wage-
earners profit-margins have
been reduced, and further
reduced by double company-
taxation, to the point where
there has been a shortage of
locally produced capital with
which to provide the modern
mechanical means with which,
in turn, to offset the production
disadvantages of our perilously
short working-week.
It is vastly difficult for an
industrially backward country
“Go on, now—beat it!”
like Australia to maintain a
high standard of living and at
the same time develop indust-
rially at the rate older overseas
countries were able to develop
half-a-century ago when work-
ing with and for a greater
population at the rate of 50
or 60 hours a week.
Dr Rao, the Dyason lecturer,
pointed-out that India was
having a similar problem, even
though its work-force is
immensely greater than that in
Australia.
Currently-developing coun-
tries, situated differently in
time and political economics
from older civilisations, should
be prepared to put in a longer
working-week in order to create
capital and productivity. Under
our present system of private
enterprise the passing of
increased capital to private
individuals is only temporary,
taxation and death-duties
taking their toll generation
after generation. Meantime,
from the worker’s point of
view, private capital is the
most fruitful form of capital,
both as to the creation of addit-
ional jobs and the raising of
living-standards.
The latest trends in wages
and costs in Australia are
disturbing. They need careful
scrutiny and discussion by all
industrialists, all financial
authorities, and all those
interested in Stock Exchange
investment.
We have, during the past two
years, been showing the benefits
of the great profit-ploughback
by corporate industry over a
much longer previous period,
as well as the advantages gained
by stability in costs achieved
partly through the suspension
of automatic Federal cost-of-
living adjustments.
But we have by no means
reached a stage where we can
be lavish with cost-inflating
consumer-spending handouts.
It will, indeed, be ridiculous if
every time we make progress
in mechanical industrial pro-
ductivity it is to be offset by
cost-inflation caused by passing
most of the benefits immedi-
ately to the consumer instead
of, in the first place, largely to
the producer.
Left with the producer for
a while, where they can be
re-employed rather than con
sumed, they will accumulate
and tend to multiply ; and in
the end will benefit the con-
sumer to a much greater extent
than through immediate con-
sumption.
“North’s” Bonus-issue
nPHE scheme announced by
North Broken Hill’s board
late last year “to bring the
capital-structure more in line
with the company’s worth” has
now been revealed as a nine-
for-one bonus-issue, to be
financed from a reserve to be
created by revaluation of the
company’s investments.
As The Bulletin pointed-
out in its issue of December 9,
besides its mine at the Barrier,
North had, at June 30, 1959,
listed shares with a book-
value of £1,612,457, a market-
value “in excess of £6 million,”
and they gave North an income
of £222,411 for 1958-59.
Besides these “listed” shares,
North had shares in unlisted
companies (mainly B. H. Asso-
ciated Smelters, Metal Manu-
facturers, Ltd., Electrolytic
Refining and Smelting Co.,
and Commonwealth Aircraft
Corp.) with a book-value of
£2,363,237, and yielding divi-
dends of £371,080 for 1958-59.
The listed cos. gave an
average dividend-yield of 3.7
p.c. on their round-figure
market-value of £6 million.
If the unlisted stocks were
valued on a 5 p.c. basis, their
true value would be nearer
£7,400,000 than their book-
value of £2,363,237.
Listed and unlisted shares
together, on this basis, added-
up to £13.7 million as at June
30 last, against a book-value
of £4 million.
Valuing the unlisted invest-
ments on a 5 p.c. basis doesn’t
seem to be overdoing it. The
North mine has well over 10
years’ ore in sight, and Zinc
Corp. and New B.H. would
appear to have a much longer
life. The investment in B.H
Associated Smelters and other
concerns dependent on the
mining industry should have as
permanent a prospect as almost
any other Australian key
secondary industry.
However, it will be interest-
ing now to find-out what valu-
ation North B.H. in the event

does put on these unlisted
shares.
In order to finance a mne-
for-one bonus-issue reserves of
£6,300,000 will be required. It
has already been shown that
listed shares would provide over
£4 million by themselves. On
The Bulletin’s computation,
there is also a reserve of over
£5 million in the unlisted shares.
It is unlikely that North
will put the full valuation on its
unlisted shares, as it hardly
seems necessary to do so for
the purpose in view.
North at present has a paid
capital of £700,000, which will
rise to £7 million after the
bonus-issue.
It has been stressed often
enough that the revaluation and
bonus-issue will in no way add
to earning-capacity, and there
is no reason to believe that total
distributions to shareholders
will increase unless the Broken
Hill mine and/or the invest-
ment-portfolio show a better
return than has been the case
over the past two years. As it
happens, the outlook for lead-
zinc-mining is rather brighter
than it was in 1958-59.
After the bonus-issue the ss.
shares will be consolidated into
10s. units. The present ss.
units, cum bonus, moved from
£7 12s. to £9 following the
bonus-issue announcement, then
settled at £B.
Linoleum Holdings, Ltd.
Investors are paying some
A overdue attention to the
shares in Linoleum Holdings,
Ltd., listed on Sydney ’Change.
Interest seems to have been
stimulated by the report pre-
pared for the Victorian Pro-
motion Committee by the Stan-
ford Research Committee of
California.
The report suggested nine
“commercial opportunities”
which it considered would be
most profitable for potential
overseas investors in Australia.
These were (1) central-heating
and air-conditioning—naturally
No. 1, and a “must” for every
Yank who visits Australia! (2)
frozen citrus-juice concentrate ;
(3) smooth floor-coverings ; (4)
motels and drive-in hotels ; (5)
pharmaceuticals; (6) poultry-
meat; (7) motor-vehicle-
supplier industry; (8) con-
struction industry ; (9) mutual-
investment funds and unit-
trusts.
The recommendation among
that lot which applies to
Linoleum Holdings, Ltd., is,
°f course, (3) —smooth floor-
coverings.
Linoleum Holdings has a
parcel of 159,999 shares in
Michael Nairn and Co. (Aust.)
Pty., Ltd., which has a paid
capital of £750,000. The
holding represents a 21.3 p.c.
interest.
Michael Nairn is the sole
manufacturer of linseed-oil-
based lino, in Australia, and it
makes rubber lino, and floor-
tiles as well. It is by far the
largest manufacturer of smooth
floor-coverings in Australia,
but has been inclined to hide
its financial light under a
bushel, and its 8 p.c. div. (from
which Linoleum Holdings paid
p.c. to its public share-
holders) seems to have been
well and truly earned. No
taxation provisions Rre dis-
closed. Visible net tangible
backing for the shares in both
the Nairn and Lino. cos. at
September 30, 1958, was 525.
each, and there was every indi-
cation that this figure was most
conservative. Allowing for a
new issue of shares in 1959,
this figure dropped to 41s. 5d.,
without taking into account
profits earned meantime.
A tight Nairn (Scotland) rein
has been kept on both dis-
closures and distributions even
in times of affluence. Now that
a big expansion-programme is
finished and additional capital
has been raised, there are
grounds for anticipating a more
realistic dividend-policy.
With the accounts of
Linoleum Holdings due very
shortly, the sharemarket has
whipped the shares up from
under 30s. to 355., buyer, the
highest quote for several years.
Peko
'T'here has been considerable
interest in the testing of
Peko’s Orlando lease, about
23 miles n.-w. of Tennant
Creek (N.T.) township.
The published results of the
preliminary drilling-campaign
were considered by the Peko
board to be sufficiently
encouraging to warrant sinking
a three-compartment shaft to
420 ft., opening-out at 380 ft.
and putting in a crosscut at
that level. At that horizon
another depressed diamond-
drillhole intersected “primary
sulphide material assaying
lldwt. of gold per ton over a
true width of 25ft.” '
Not a bad showing, parti-
cularly as the values are in
primary ore (not a secondary
enrichment). Secondary
enrichments are very nice when
you get them, but primary ore
gives better promise of per-
manence.
Local feeling is that at the
contact of the fractured
oxidised zone and the compact
sulphide body of primary ore
there could be a rich section.
So there could ; but it is by no
means a certainty.
Straight Talk on Trade
[From Canberra]
'T’rade Minister John Mc-
Ewen is to be congratulated
for his straight - from - the -
shoulder comments on the
recent Paris talks between
members of the two European
trading -blocs and the U.S. and
Canada.
He made it quite clear from
the outset that Australia would
not be bound by any decisions
reached by an international
trade-group in whose discus-
sions Australia was not a par-
ticipant.
Resolutions carried at the
Paris meeting indicated that
the two European blocs the
“Sixes” and the “Sevens”—
wanted not only to create new
machinery to deal with internal
European trade, but also inter-
national trade policies.
McEwen said Australia fully
recognised that European
countries had every right to
establish a regional organisa-
tion to facilitate the solution
of internal European trade
problems, arising from the
establishment of two trading-
blocs in the European theatre.
However, Australia, as a
country in the top bracket in
world trading-nations, must
view with concern the pro-
posal that major international
trade problems be discussed in
bodies of which Australia and
other non-European countries
were not members.
Australia firmly regarded the
GATT organisation as the
established and proper forum
for the discussion of inter-
national trade problems and
policies.
The resolutions of the Paris
conference indicated that the
new machinery should operate
without infringing the com-
petence of existing inter-
national institutions, including

L. Owen’s Oil Credo
Tt was as if by an extra-
-*• ordinary stroke of tragic
fate, ordained by “the patron
deity of the oil game—the
impish God of Chance,” that
the Heron aircraft, owned by a
Portuguese airline, carrying
The Bulletin’s well-known
oil-correspondent, L. Owen, to
the Timor oilfield should have
disappeared without a radio
distress-signal on January 26 —
lost with Owen and everyone
else on board.
A fate particularly frustrat-
ing and perverse as well as
tragic. For Owen was at last
on his way to put to the test
his theories and practical
knowledge on the method of
searching for migrated oil in
this part of the world. He had
been retained by Timor Oil,
Ltd., in a consulting capacity,
and according to the schedule
he gave The Bulletin he
should have arrived within a
day or two of his departure
from ISydney on January 20.
But he was, in fact, delayed in
Darwin for several days, and
the plane eventually took-off on
the 26th to encounter foul
weather from which it never
emerged.
Owen came into prominence
in the pages of The Bulletin
after the oil-strike at Rough
Range (W.A.) at the end of
1953, though he had been
writing for the paper since 1946
From the first factual infor-
mation that came to hand after
the strike he issued a warning
that Rough Range was not a
commercial field on the evid-
ence available, and that the
oil-strike was, in fact, a “fossil
seep.”
His opinions on oil-search
in Australia aroused consider-
able controversy, though mostly
the oil-exploration companies
themselves have kept their own
counsel on the matter.
He himself summed-up his
opinion of the Rough Range
“strike” and the Birdrong hori-
zon in The Bulletin of
3/4/’57 as follows:
“IUY opinion—often expressed
in print—is that the Bird-
rong horizon has produced no
evidence of potentialities as an
oil-reservoir, except in isolated
instances, such as in Rough
Range No. 1 well, where the oil
was fed to it by an unusual
combination of factors.
“The reason for the barren-
ness of the Birdrong horizon
may be attributed largely to
the long period of non-deposi-
tion which persisted over most
of the area in question from
Upper Permian to Lowe-
Jurassic times. Personally, I
have little doubt that the
source-beds of the Rough
Range oil can be no younger
than Lower Permian: they
could be much older. I visualise
the obviously long-migrated
and inspissated Rougli Range
petroleum as a remnant-on the
early Jurassic land-mass, of a
much more impressive seep (or
collection of seeps) which,
before complete dispersal, was
preserved by the timely deposi-
tion of the Birdrong bed.”
His broad concept of oil-
occurrence in Australia was out-
lined in this extract from 11.
l/5/’s7:
“T> efor e the oil-boom struck
the country it was accepted,
as a working basis, that the
Australian mainland had re-
mained above sea-level from
Upper Permian throughout
Triassic times and into the
Lower Cretaceous. This con-
ception, although it has been
modified in minor detail by the
geological surveys and deep-
drilling carried out by the major
oil-companies, is still accepted,
and the general fact remains
that a major hiatus in the
marine stratigraphical column
persisted over most of the
continent throughout Triassic
times.
“During stages of that long
terrestrial Epoch which, in
some parts, was extended to
almost a Period on the geo-
logical time-scale the land-
mass was subjected to folding,
heavy faulting and erosion, and
these processes, both singly and
in conjunction, caused the
broaching of some of the
petroleum accumulations
LAUNCELOT OWEN
trapped below the surface, thus
giving birth to oil-seepages.
“Owing to the length of
time during which these seeps
were continuously exposed, in
Western Australia, to the
Triassic atmosphere, it could be
forecast that nearly all of the
oil which reached the surface
would be dispersed. In most
instances it found its way to
the sea and disappeared. In
some cases, however, the oil
travelled so slowly that, through
inspissation, the oil lost its
fluidity and was thus preserved
to some extent. As a rarer
occurrence, the seeping oil was
adsorbed by water-borne clay-
particles and then deposited to
form a mudstone showing
traces of oil. Such mudstones
are often mistaken for primary
‘source’-beds.
“Material for drawing the
main outlines of the picture
presented above was available,
with reference to the Australian
mainland, before 1940. It is
a pity that it was not used as a
hypothesis for explaining some
of the anomalies encountered in
physical-survey interpretations
of the Carnarvon Basin of
Western Australia, and it is
rather ironical that proof of the
existence of remnants of
seepages within that structure
should have been obtained—
quite unexpectedly —in the
first Rough Range test-well.
“In seepage areas, the siting
of wells which have a chance
of producing commercial
quantities of oil is a difficult
enough problem even when the
seeps are active and still un-
covered, and should be
attempted only by
petroleum - geologists
who possess the very
specialised experi-
ence gained by many
years of field-work
in such areas. The
problem becomes
even more difficult
when much of the
evidence is hidden
by the deposition of
younger beds. Under
such circumstances,
academic qualifica-
tions, however out-
standing, in them-
selves are useless
and may constitute a
handicap.
“In W.A., geo-
physical - survey
methods have been
greatly favored for
penetrating the ob-
scuring blanket of
younger strata ; un-
fortunately, the phy-
sical characteristics
of these strata have
caused distortion in the
geophysical graphs, whose
correct interpretation, anyway,
is dependent upon a full
understanding of the funda-
mental characteristics of the
local structures and of their
tectonic history.
“In other States in Aus-
tralia, the effect of the long
periods of non-deposition and
erosion, as well as the presence
of masking blankets, have
adversely affected the prospects
of striking oil by the ‘normal’
methods of exploration. Each
State, in fact, offers its unique
problems which will have to be
solved by specially adapted
techniques, although there is
little sign of attempting to do
this at the moment.
“In my considered opinion,
the best prospects of com-
mercial production still he
along the Western Australian
coast, and for varying distances

“Journey to the Moon”
The most remarkable thing
about the Borovansky world-
premiere of Paul Grinwis’s
full-length ballet at Sydney
Empire was the relief of the
audience after Act 1. No
expressionistic German danc-
ing, no dramatic lunges and
pointings, no spacemen hel-
mets ; just a Hans Andersen
fairytale with an ugly hero
somewhat like Andersen him-
self —an 18th-century astro-
nomy-student, disowned by his
professor, mocked by the other
students, in love with the
housekeeper’s daughter.
Soothed by Donizetti’s music,
everyone settled down uncriti-
cally to enjoy the show while
in three more acts, five more
scenes, the ugly student
dreamed of his adventures, in
each of which the house-
keeper’s daughter had the lead-
ing part.
In the Chinese act she was
a princess in circumstances in-
volving warriors and execu-
tioners and a dancing-bird
(Rosalia Kurowska); in the
stratosphere, at the court of
Jupiter (Keith Little), she was
Venus falling, much to the ugly
young astronomer’s annoyance,
heavily in love with Mars,
danced with petulant fire by
Garth Welch ; in the Palace of
Moonrays, which is evidently
the last stop for moon-travel-
lers, she was the princess
again, with a set of attendant
moons (“Lenten,” “Old,”
“Hunter’s,” etc.) of which the
reviewer was most taken by
the “Grass Moons” hung with
long trails of green.
The show was over and the
reviewer on his way home
when he encountered a nagging
thought like that of a raincoat
left behind. What had Mr.
Grinwis done with the story?
The Chinese act, the strato-
sphere section and the Moon-
rays Palace scene were merely
dream-interludes, and the
Kingdom of Night scene and
the Kingdom of Birds scene
“Don't be ridiculous , Mother! People are much too
stupid to recognise the model."
were interludes to interludes.
How, then, was it possible to
be so well entertained for an
entire evening by a ballet which
was merely a set of interludes?
The answer must be that
designer Elaine Haxton was
covering-up for Mr. Grinwis.
The decor and the dressing—
there was a man in yellow with
black stripes; there was the
Stratosphere Bird were at
their best in the groupings: the
entry and disposal of Jupiter
and his court, drunk » the
warmth and richness of color
in all the scenes in the
astronomer’s laboratory; the
varied invention of the Moon
Palace scene.
Then again, in the “Birds”
section, where the ugly student
was trying to steal a huge egg
from a nest, it was the finished
dancing of Pomie and Biegovic
that forestalled wonderment as
to what this all had to do with
astronomers.
But probably Mr. Grinwis
must get all the credit for the
“Kingdom of Night” scene,
played against black by three
sets of dancers one with
white hands, another with
white feet, another with white
faces—who finally combine to
dance as though the several sets
of faces, feet and hands were
normally owned. That was
sheer virtuosity, superbly
planned and done.
One enjoyed it all much more
than one should have ; it had
the gilt which makes the
gingerbread really memorable,
both in love and art. For this
one has also to thank a de-
voted and seemingly inexhaust-
ible cast —especially Christiane
Hubert, the housekeeper’s
daughter who was also the
Chinese Princess, the alluring
and shameless Venus and the
Moon Princess; Keith Little,
who was the astronomer,
Jupiter and the Moon-
politician ; Jeffrey Kovel, who
led the astronomy students and
then became Mercury; Leon
Kellaway, who was the house-
keeper, executioner and Queen
of the Moon; and Paul
Grinwis, who was all through
the piece as the ugly young
astronomy-student from the
provinces.
Altogether, the show was not
as tightly arranged as that
other Australian world-
premiere “Graduation Ball,”
but it made an evening of fine
entertainment.
Artbursts
Roy Fluke
Roy Fluke’s abstracts at
Sydney Macquarie Galleries
are, at a time of vigorous, and
often indiscriminate, experi-
mentation in abstract art, a
welcome sight indeed. Most of
them have vigor, but they are
seldom indiscriminate. His
least appealing works are those
in which he allows Chinese
letters to run riot.
In Fluke’s hands the use of
oriental lettering amounts
virtually to a leitmotif. Many
of the paintings are dominated
by these figures, used either
integrally or decoratively. In
the big “Shop Wall” a huge
black symbol in the centre is
linked with smaller characters
around it. In the tiny and
mildly exciting “However” the
central red letter, with its in-
herently interesting shape,
dictates the structure of the
whole painting. Similarly, “For
Kwan Yin” is built on, rather
than merely helped by, Chinese
letters; and in “Character” the
richness of the background
lends an almost sinister appear-
ance to the eight-legged black
figure. “Part of a Letter” is
basically the same, except that
the background is, in its reds,
yellows and greys, even more
striking.
But these symbols can be
used too much. In “Grey
Clouds” it is hard to ascertain
whether the big white squiggles
are Chinese characters or
simply an extension of the not-
particularly-cloudlike clouds.
But “Boat Black Bobbing,” if
a little outspoken in its stark

Films
“The Last Train from
Gun Hill”
Over the past decade two
Westerns—“ High Noon” and
“Shane” —set a standard by
which all other films in the
genre have come to be judged.
In its development of
character, in its searchings of
conscience, in its presentation
of the loneliness of one deter-
mined and courageous man, in
its all-round excellence of act-
ing and above all in its generat-
ing and maintenance of terrific
tensions, this one from Para-
mount outstrips them both.
The wife of a town marshal
(Kirk Douglas) is ra,ped and
murdered by two young men,
one of whom she cuts to the
cheekbone with her whip be-
fore she is overwhelmed.
Escaping they have to leave
behind an ornate saddle, which
the marshal recognises as
belonging to an old friend of
his, a cattle-baron (Anthony
Quinn) who runs the nearby
town of Gun Hill and every-
body in it.
The marshal returns the
saddle, and, the cut identifying
the cattleman’s only son, who,
though rotten, is regarded with
inordinate affection by his
sire, the marshal announces his
intention of taking both
culprits in custody on that
night’s train, having six hoqrs
to accomplish what looks an
impossible assignment, with
the whole town backing their
boss.
How he resourcefully sets
about arresting the son —hold-
ing him against first a sortie
and then a siege in a hotel-
bedroom —and finally gets him
to the station becomes in the
telling quite feasible, with one
or two not-outrageously-lucky
breaks assisting. The climactic
sequence —when he drives to
the station holding a sawn-off
shotgun by a hair-ti igger with
the barrel under the chin of
his prisoner, thus checkmating
the beef-fancier and his
trigger-happy mercenaries
and the rich drama of the
denouement on the platform
combine to make as gripping
a stretch of excitement as this
commentator has expeiienced
in years.
Although the director
develops his tensions without
hurry there is never any sug-
gestion of drag. His accent is
always on the conflict of minds
and wills. Every situation
flowing from the marshal’s
determination to take the men
in is as clear-cut and logical
as the tactics of a good battle-
commander.
Kirk Douglas’s commanding
physique and appearance are
enhanced by an intellectual
approach to a role that was
tailor-made for him. Quinn
is no less admirable in a part of
changing moods, and he is
most impressive when delineat-
ing the inner struggle of a man
well aware that his course of
action is at variance with his
better nature.

Other Sydney releases:
“It Started with a Kiss” (St.
James): Lightweight comedy
with Glenn Ford as a U.S. Air
Force sergeant stationed in
Spain frustratedly trying to get
into bed with his bride (Debbie
Reynolds), who develops a
strange complex about this
aspect of marriage. Apart from
the engaging charms of Miss
Reynolds, the film also
displays a brilliant-red
American sports - car
with a plastic top by
which the Spanish
citizens are duly
stunned. Best part of
the affair is the beauti-
fully presented rural
and urban scenery.
“Woman Obsessed” (Cen-
tury) : The makers of this melo-
drama, set in the Saskatchewan
backwoods, seem to have been
unable to decide whether the
male lead was to be a noble-
minded hero with caddish over-
tones or a crossgrained out-
and-outer with a good streak
or two ; and Stephen Boyd, in
this role of a stepfather who
wants to be kind to his stepson
by being cruel, does a fumbling
job. Susan Hayward wildly
overstates her part of the affair,
and the final sequence is lurid
melodrama verging on parody.

The Report of the Joint Com-
mittee on Constitutional
Review is an amazing docu-
ment. Certainly unificationists
will enthuse about most of the
committees recommendations.
But Federalists will find little
in the report for approval.
What the committee has suc-
cessfully produced is a cata-
logue of proposals which, if
adopted, would complete the
already entrenched process of
legislative centralisation in
Australia.
The first question any sup-
porter of the Federalist con-
cept will ask on reading the
report is, Why did the majority
of Government members on
the committee support the
recommendations ?
No mysticism envelops the
answer. The Government
parties on the joint committee
were represented by able and
intelligent members, but by
members whose gentlemanly
instincts were suffocated by the
ways of those brought-up in
the rough-and-tumble and guile
of Labor politics.
Labor saw to it that its
representatives on the com-
mittee were both front-bench
members and devout Socialists.
They were Senators McKenna
and Kennelly, and Messrs. Cal-
well, Ward, Pollard and Whit-
lam. With the exception of
former Attorney-General Sir
Neil O’Sullivan, and Alex
Downer, who, subsequent to
the committee’s appointment,
became Minister for Immigra-
tion, the Government did not
have any Ministerial representa-
tion. The Prime Minister and
Dr. Evatt were ex officio
members, but neither attended
a committee-meeting.
Most disappointing are the
committee’s proposals relating
to the Senate. The proposals
offer no hope of meeting the
intention of the founders of the
Constitution that the Senate
should be a House of review.
Indeed, the proposals seem
well designed to make the
Senate a timorous and ready
echo of opinion in the House
of Representatives. It was
left to Senator Wright, in a
vigorous and well-argued dis-
senting report, to put the case
for the Senate. He wrote: —•
It is preferable to destroy abuses
which tend to corrupt good institu-
tions rather than fulfil the purpose
of the abuse, and because the insti-
tution has worsened under the
abuse, destroy the institution... .It
is not the constitution of the Senate
which needs reform. It Is the abuses
in its party management which
should be corrected.
Senator Wright may not be the
most popular of Government
members in Canberra, but at
least he knows how to write
and speak in the tradition of
genuine Liberalism.
The committee proposes that
in granting a double-dissolution
it shall be expressly pro-
vided that the Governor-
General should act on the
advice of the Federal Executive
Council. The impossible piece
of impertinence represented
by that proposal is, of course,
very much in keeping with a
long-held ambition of Dr.
Evatt. In his The King and His
Dominion Governors he
painstakingly propounds the
thesis that there is a need to
reduce to statutory form the
reserve powers of the Crown.
The fact that the Monarch or
her representatives could, in
certain circumstances, frustrate
a power-drunk Government,
has always been anathema to
Socialist theorists.
The committee was
strangely silent on the obvious
inadequacy of the defence
power and on Commonwealth-
State financial relations. Why?
Surely these two matters
warranted both examination
and report by a committee pur-
porting to review the Com-
monwealth Constitution.
The defence power has been
generously interpreted by the
High Court in times of war,
but that judicial body has not
been persuaded by submissions
on the significance and dangers
of the cold war as they relate
to the defence power. Alfred
Deakin prophesied that the
financial power of the Com-
monwealth would eventually
destroy the Federalist system,
and each day his prophecy takes
on firmer meaning.
Labor is generally indifferent
to defence matters —a host of
its supporters either failing to
comprehend the tactics of inter-
national Communism, or
actively aiding its agents in
this country by unity-ticket
collaboration and the like. That
the supremacy of the Common-
wealth in financial matters will
destroy the sovereignty of the
States is welcome to Labor.
That is part of its platform—
“To clothe the Common-
wealth Parliament with un-
limited powers ” Yet why
the silence of Government
members of the Committee on
the defence and financial issues?
Their silence is disturbing and
bewildering. .
On corporations and capital-
issues, the committee has found
it convenient to recommend a
set of proposals which could
very easily enable Government
control to extend to the whole
of Australian industry and
commerce.
The industrial power
recommended by the committee
is an ambitious one. Given
the appropriate political cir-
cumstance, it would transform
electioneering into bargaining
on a magnificent scale
Labor members of the com-
mittee must have found it hard
to disguise their surprise at
getting agreement on the
marketing and inter-State road-
transport proposals, for these
trim-down Section 92 in such
a way as to excite the imagina-
tion of any centralist.
Early in the new session,
Parliament will debate the Re-
port of the Joint Committee on
Constitutional Review. It is a
foregone conclusion that the
Government will accept very
few of the committee’s recom-
mendations. Those close to die
Attorney-General, Sir Garfield
Barwick, know he passionately
believes in the Federalist system,
and his disarming advocacy,
coupled with his lively under-
standing of the Constitution,
will influence the Government
against rushing into what could
be a fateful referendum.
Australians are prone to
regard the Constitution as a
dry, anachronistic document—
a halter on national progress.
That view is nonsense. The
Constitution was the product of
great men, with great vision
and profound wisdom. It
breathed life into the Aus-
tralian nation. It has served the
Australian people well. That
it is deserving of modification
few will deny, but not along
the lines suggested by the
Report of the Joint Committee.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Amalgamated Wireless (A’sia), Ltd.
The co. is one of the largest manu-
facturers of radio and television
transmitting and receiving equipment in
Australia, and owns or controls over
3000 patents covering radio, radar and
television. A.W.A. owns, or operates,
eight commercial broadcasting - stations
and holds substantial interests in
others. The co. has a share - interest
in one of Sydney’s commercial
TV - stations. In addition, A.W.A.
is a large-scale producer of various
domestic and industrial electrical
appliances, traffic-control mechanisms,
gramophone and other records (under
licence), and is a major supplier of com-
munications equipment to Common-
wealth and State Government depart-
ments and agencies.
Fluctuation in demand for TV-
receivers, following the near-saturation
of the first line of advance into N.S.W.
and Victorian suburbia, was not reflected
in the disclosed earnings. However,
competition increased, there was “a
general reduction in price-levels,” and
profit-margins slimmed-down a bit. But
record production-figures were achieved.
“Sales of television-receivers were very
satisfactory and provided the principal
source of revenue.” Broadcast-receiver
turnover was “greatly helped” by the
introduction of transistor portable sets.
Sales of A.W.A.’s consumer-products
were said to have substantially exceeded
the previous year’s. Refrigerators, wash-
ing-machines, stoves and air-conditioners
are expected to be of increasing im-
portance, “not only to support other
lines, but as major sales.”
The co.’s engineering-products depart-
ment (largely operating on Government
contracts) has been kept busy. There are
now more than 5000 road-vehicles fitted
with A.W.A. receiver - transmitters. The
broadcasting-department (which operates
Sydney 2CH and the co.’s country
stations at Goulburn, Grafton and
Warwick) “improved its results.” The
marine department was adversely affected
by the world shipping-slump.
. Only the parent co.’s figures are pub-
lished, incorporating the results of
various branches. Gross revenue from
sales, wireless - services, commissions,
rentals, school - fees, dividends and in-
terest for the year ended June 30, 1959,
was £2,303,875 higher at £15,716,836.
Manufacturing, trading and administra-
tion costs, including an undisclosed pro-
vision for taxation and £252,272 depre-
ciation write-off (up £15,485), were
£2,273,689 higher at £15,015,577.
Net disclosed profit increased by
£30,186 to £701,259, or 31.5 p.c. on the
average ordinary capital, compared with
30.1 p.c., 15.4 p.c., 16.7 p.c., 27.1 p.c.
and 25.4 p.c. looking back over five
years to 1954:

The div.-rate was lifted from 14 p.c.
to 16 p.c. (including a 5 p.c. “bonus”),
absorbing £356,137. Reserves received
£345,122 and also benefited by £46,312
profit on sale of assets. Total parent’s
reserves and undistributed profits were
disclosed at £2,827,919. after deducting
£85,811 intangibles. This does not in-
clude £2,119,462 (up £255,110) deprecia-
tion reserve and £918,431 (up £321,582)
provision for plant obsolescence,
development and long-service leave.
Additional plant was installed at the
Ashfield (N.S.W.) workshops. The co.’s
research facilities were extended, par-,
ticularlv in the field of electronics.
Book-value of plant (subject to accumu-
lated provisions for depreciation and
obsolescence) was £271,927 higher at
£2,486,080.
Shares in subsidiaries —an intriguing
item —showed a decline by £7500 to
£200,786. This nominal sum would in-
clude A.W.A.’s interest in Amalgamated
Wireless Valve Co. Pty., which shares
the market for radio- and TV-valves
with Philips. The subsidiary also
manufactures transistor radio - sets.
A.W.A. Valve Co. Pty. was said to have
had “a successful year.” However, the
continued success of its venture into
transistors could be adversely affected by
cheaper imports, particularly from Japan.
The figure for current stocks is
strikingly low —down £99,914 in spite
of the 17 p.c. rise in turnover. How-
ever, work-in-progress was £240,683
higher, and the combined item was dis-
closed at £3.681,884 (up £140,769). Cash,
etc., jumped by £785,066 to £841,262.
but book-debts were £247,650 lower at
£2,473,609 (including £295,325 owed by
subsidiaries):

Net visible tangible asset - backing
worked out at 11s. Id. for each ss. stock-
unit, but it is obviously much greater
when inner reserves are taken into
account.
In view of the fact that some sub-
sidiaries appear as debtors to the parent
co., it would seem that these particular
ones are not called upon to pass-on
much of their profits in dividends. Other
subsidiaries have been able to advance
£588,010 more than they have paid in
dividends.
The restoration of a 16 p.c. dividend
by A.W.A. on doubled share-capital
within only three years of the 1956
1-for-l bonus-handout is convincing
evidence of the dynamic growth and
impressive earning-power of this 97 p.c.
Australian-owned concern and of its
undisclosed resources.
Wide diversification of electric- and
radio-engineering and electronic interests
provides a safety-cushion against adverse
market-fluctuation in any one sphere of
business activities. With the second line
of the national TV-market ready for
action A.W.A. is geared for a new thrust
forward. The co. is in the envious posi-
tion of being a leading national TV-
producer and also the exclusive manufac-
turer of a number of vital replacement-
parts, such as tubes.
The sharemarket's last estimate of the
worth of A.W.A.’s scrip is 295. for
each ss. ord. stock-unit. The immediate
yield on the basis of the 16 p.c, div.-rate
was a “blue-chip low” 2.7 p.c.
The £774,137 of 6| p.e. unsecured
notes is convertible into ords. at par on
June 30, 1962. The notes participate in
cash issues, but not in any bonus issues
that might come along. The £1 notes
figure in the unlisted quotes of ’Change,
and are priced at 975. 3d., giving the pur-
chaser the right to four A.W.A. ss, shares

Minster, Ltd.
Fortunate indeed the investor who set
sail early on Minster’s magic carpet.
His journey, spiced the way with profits,
bonus-share issues, romance and not a
little mystery, is in the telling as fabulous
as anything recounted by Sinbad the
Sailor. The investor who put £lOO into
the Minster venture in 1946 (100 20s.
shares in Westminster Carpets Pty.)
would now, and without so much as
having paid out one penny in the mean-
time, have a shareholding (700 10s.
shares in Minster, Ltd.) worth £2BBB on
today’s market —the 10s shares fetched
82s. 6d. (cum rights to the bonus-issue)
last week. In addition, he would have
received £335 in dividends, with another
£35 coming on March 31.
Minster’s financial carpet was first
unrolled in 1946. From a factory at
Dandenong (Vic.), Westminster Carpets
Pty., on July 12, 1949, commenced pro-
duction of rubber - bonded Westminster
carpet (this subsidiary is now the largest
maker of pile carpet in Australia), a
carpet particularly suited to Australian
conditions and used extensively today
not only in motor-vehicles as originally
planned, but also in homes and offices.
In 1952, Minster, Ltd., was registered
as a holding-co. with Whitehead Chemi-
cal Co. Pty. and Westminster Carpets
Pty. its two subsidiaries. Further acquisi-
tions since then include Rayon (A’sia)
Processing Co. Pty. (flock and flock-
coated paper and fabrics), Linatex
(Aust.) Pty. (corrosion- and abrasion-
resistant rubber products), and Sydney
Cotton Mills, Ltd., the assets of which
have been largely disposed of. Capacity
and output of the carpet - plant
were bumped up again last term,
yet still supply trails the field —
present plant - capacity is three times
greater than that installed in the original
factory at Dandenong. Export markets
in North America are being developed.
It seems certain that Minster will again
increase productive capacity.
Minster’s consolidated pre-tax profit
leapt 55 p.c. (£317,317) to £894,773 last
term. The Minster plant is the closest
thing yet in the carpet game to automa-
tion. Finished-product labor-content is
consequently small and costs as a result
can be rigidly controlled.
Goat-hair, the basic component of
carpet-manufacture and also a carrier
of anthrax bacilli, is bought exclusively
from overseas sources. In the past this
has necessitated subjection of all im-
ports to a costly process of fumigation.
By means of gamma-sterilisation, as
incorporated in plant recently bought
from Britain, debaling becomes unneces-
sary, and handling - costs are greatly
reduced. The plant, which operates
under the auspices of the Gamma
Sterilisation Pty., a subsidiary formed
by Minster in Feb., 1959, will be avail-
able for hire to other manufacturers
requiring sterilisation services. It is
possible, too, that its range of application
will extend even further than fumiga-
tion: for instance to the preservation
of foodstuffs.

ster’s impressive profit record:

After setting aside £341,321 (up
£133,626) for taxation and £92,909 (up
£27,574) for depreciation, net profit was
49.7 p.c. higher than in the previous
year, lifting £183,691 to £553,452. This
represents an earning-rate of 51.3 p.c.
on paid-up capital, as against 34.4 p.c.
and 24.2 p.c. in the two preceding terms.
Shareholders joined in the festivities, and
divs., held constant from 1953 onwards,
rose 5 p.c. to 20 p.c. Reserves, after
sundry adjustments, including £25,000
transferred to plant-replacement provi-
sion, rose by £299,364 to £655,288.
As mentioned previously, shareholders
have not, beyond their initial outlay,
been called on at any time to contribute
funds. Expansion has been financed
entirely from retained profits:

Last term added capacity, plus installa-

took book-values of plant from £599,161
to £836,263, an increase of £237,102.
Freeholds fell £102,574 to £455,279. And
at the same time theoretical working-
capital rose £190,048 to £507,661. Stocks
and debtors were up, the one at £783,667
(up £490,129), the other at £290,249 (up

Minster has just announced its third
bonus-issue —one free share for each two
held at March 9 next. This follows a one-
for-one bonus issue in 1951 and a three-
for-four bonus issue in 1957. The board
predicts maintenance of the 20 p.c. div.
rate.
How much scope remains in Australia
for expansion by Minster is an interesting
question. On the carpet side, a build-up
of earning-power from Australian sales
seems unlikely to be as spectacular in
the future as in the past. But results of
the Canadian venture will be awaited
with keen interest.
The 10s. shares, which had been selling
at 765.-odd before the bonus announce-
ment, rose within a few days to 88s.
Prices have since dropped back to 82s. 6d.
The ex-rights value works out at 555.
to give a yield of 3.6 p.c. from a 20 p.c.
div. Net tangible assets-backing is 16s.

valuation of the whole enterprise is just
a shade under the £9 million mark.
H. B. Selby Australia, Ltd.

from the investor’s point of view,
H. B. Selby Australia, Ltd., is slowly
but steadily edging-up its earnings. Over
the past 10 years the dividend-rate has
gone up from 8 p.c. to 12 p.c., reflecting
steady, if not dramatic, progress.
This old-established and quietly suc-
cessful co. manufactures and distributes
scientific instruments and fine chemicals.
It supplies a wide range of technical
and laboratory equipment to Govern-
ment institutions, educational establish-
ments, hospitals, the medical profession,
mines, etc. Branches operate in all State
capitals. The manufacturing-subsidiary,
Analite Pty., has factories in Sydney and
Melbourne.
Operating - costs, particularly wages
and salaries, continued to rise during
the last term. Marketing of recently
developed scientific instruments, requir-
ing the services of suitably trained
technicians, increased distribution ex-
penses. However, turnover increased
substantially and a small reduction in
overall average costs was achieved.
The manufacturing subsidiary had a
good year. During last term, among
other products, the Sydney factory pro-
duced sets of stainless-steel weights for
the N.S.W. National Standards Labora-
tory.

The rapid growth of scien-

recent years provides an ex-
panding market for H. B.
Selby’s goods and services. The
trend is likely to continue.
There was only one share-
issue (l-for-4 at par in 1956)
during the last eight years, and
dramatic capital developments
seem unlikely. Past experience
shows, however, that the co.
willingly shares its prosperity
with the shareholders.
H. B. Selby’s sturdy scrip
last changed hands at 14s. a ss.
unit. The immediate yield, on
the basis of the new 12 p.c.
div.-rate, is 4.3 p.c.
Supertex Industries, Ltd.
T AST term’s earnings were
easily the best in many
years. The dividend-rate was
lifted from 6 p.c. to p.c.,
delighting the long-suffering
shareholders. Things looked
grim in 1955 and 1956, when
the divs. were passed alto-
gether, and little better in 1957
when a 3 p.c. payout swallowed
almost the whole net profit.
Some 15 months ago,
Supertex ss. ords. could be
bought for 2s. 6d. Last year’s
“low” improved to 35., still
well below par.
At the last sale in Sydney
the shares fetched 6s. lOd. The
yield is 5.6 p.c. on the basis
of last year’s p.c. div.-rate.
The ss. ords. are backed by
6s. 7d. of net tangible assets.
First registered in N.S.W.
in February, 1946, and con-
verted to a public co. in
December, 1947, Supertex is a
manufacturer of chenille
products and towelling.
Initially a good profit-spinner,
the co. suffered extensively
from changing tastes, transi-
tion from a post-war sellers’
to a buyers’ market, and an
over-vigorous decentralisation
in the early years.
Since then, Supertex appears
to have ironed-out the most
pressing manufacturing,
marketing and administrative
problems and is making good
headway. All manufacturing
activities are concentrated at
Goulburn, N.S.W. The dis-
tributing-centre is at Alex-
andria, an inner Sydney
suburb. The firm is directly
represented in Melbourne
through its subsidiary, Mosley
and Kemp Pty., a manchester-
goods specialist.
“Considerable increases” in
orders were said to have kept

This was after providing a

aside £55,141 (up £18,717) for

Titanium Minerals, Ltd.
'T'itanium Minerals, Ltd.,
is engaged in beach-mining,
mainly for rutile, at
Jerusalem Creek, near Wood-
burn, on the North Coast of
N.S.W. The co. was formed
(as Woodburn Minerals) in
1952, but suspended operations
in August, 1953, due to early
difficulties. Under stimulus of
the boom in rutile prices, pro-
duction was resumed in May,
1956, when Metal Traders, Ltd.
(of London), provided the
necessary funds, and also took-
up 120,000 ss. shares.
Because of the continued
low world prices of rutile, all
production operations were
again suspended by July, 1959.
However, this did not affect the
co.’s forward sale-contracts.
The co. is at present engaged in
a geological examination of its
leases to determine the most
favorable areas for future
exploitation. Progress to date
is said to be “encouraging.”
Consolidated net profit for
the year ended June 30, 1959,
was down £43,127 at £49,978,
after a mudh lower deprecia-
tion provision (£44,098, down

reduced by £lO,OOO to £20,000
during last term. The balance
owing by Titanium Minerals in
connection with purchase of
shares in the subsidiary Rusan
Minerals Pty. was finally paid-
off early in the current year.
The mineral-sands industry
has experienced a difficult
period during the last two
years or so. Bureau of
Mineral Resources statistics
indicate that rutile-production
for 1958 was about 40 p.c.
less than for 1957. The market
is still uncertain, demand from
overseas being weak. There
has been a general lowering of
prices to a level at which it
“became uneconomic for pro-
duction to continue,” except
to supply existing contracts.
It is expected that rutile-
production figures for the full
year i 959 will be still lower.
With immediate prospects
rather bleak, buyers last
offered 2s. for each ss. f.-p.
ord. It is anybody’s guess
when the next dividend is going
to come, and what it will be.

ciation and depletion was

for renewals was unchanged at
£5OOO. Net profit, after tax and
depreciation, was £33,611
(down £9370). However, “in
addition to the amount of
£15,750 provided in accounts
for Malayan income-tax, pay-
ment by way of excise-duty and

duced amounted to £25,677.”

London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
The first night of “La
Travi a t a” at Covent
Garden was expected to be as
big an occasion as the “Lucia
di Lammermoor” nearly a year
ago. A loyal audience, many
of whom had heard Joan
Sutherland as Gilda, Agathe,
Desdemona, the Prioress in
Poulenc’s “Carmelites” and
Lucia, was agog to take part
in the gathering fame of a
new international diva.
To everybody’s disappoint-
ment, events didn’t turn out
that way. After the promising
first act, with five curtain-
calls, interest slackened, and
the uneasiness evident on the
stage spread to the audience.
The evening might well have
ended disastrously had not the
singing recovered spirit at the
end of the third and during
the last acts.
Such is the exacting respon-
sibility of fame. Miss Suther-
land, despite her musicianship,
vocal agility and beautiful
purity of tone, had moments
of hoarseness and her acting
was formless and ill-at-ease.
(It was thought that she was
suffering from first - night
nerves; the real trouble,
laryngitis, was not known until
next day.)
It is not the purpose of these
comments to record the failure
of a great singer nor to hold
an inquest. But the experi-
ence does provoke some
inquiring questions on opera-
production.
Despite the generally-held
opinion, singers are not neces-
sarily bad actors. Our great
actors sometimes fake their
way through a part or fall
back on technique when they
are off-color. But they don't
have to sing as well. The
singer’s task is infinitely
harder. What seems to be lack-
ing is an opera-producer who
can get the best out of his
company in acting as well as
in singing and who can give
the plot atmosphere and
shape.
Violetta is the same
character as was played by
Bernhardt in “La Dame aux
Camelias.” The four stages
of her transition (courtesan,
wordly-wise altruist, self-
sacrificing lover and dying
consumptive) are sufficient to
deter the bravest of dramatic
actresses. To the opera-singer,
faced with this ordeal, a know-
ledgable and sympathetic pro-
ducer is essential. The Covent
Garden performance was
anonymously produced and
looked it. If Violetta is the
lyrical soprano’s Hamlet, she
should be helped along. Miss
Sutherland’s make-up, for
example, was not only pallid
and spectral but inescapably
haunting in the wrong sense.
She is soon to leave for the
Continent, where she will
appear in opera-houses as far
apart as Vienna and Palermo
under the tutelage of Zeffirelli
and Serafin (who respectively
produced and conducted
“Lucia”). By the time she
returns to England, for
Glyndebourne, it will be sur-
prising if she has not proved
herself as Violetta.

Offbeat Fun
The English Stage Company
is in funds again, with two
consecutive winners. “Ros-
mersholm,” though, will not
emulate “The Entertainer” and
run up the profits, since Peggy
Ashcroft is committed for
Stratford-on-Avon (in any
event, she firmly refuses to
play the same part for longer
than six,months).
To follow this exhausting
play, the Royal Court has put
on a frolic by one of its coterie,
N. F. Simpson, a South
London schoolmaster. His
offbeat fantasy, “One Way
Pendulum,” is playing to
capacity, but nothing has yet
been heard of a transfer to the
West End. Its appeal, perhaps,
is considered too esoteric.
Simpson’s humor is idio-
syncratic, grotesque and pro-
lific. His ideas bound and
rebound with nuclear intensity
and those that don’t get lost
or entangled in prolixity are
unusually funny, if only for
their absurdity.
Of the Groomkirbys, a
suburban family, the son
collects “Speak Your Weight”
weighing-machines, so that he
can conduct them performing
the “Hallelujah” Chorus; to
justify his taste for mourning
and to rationalise his actions,
he makes his victims laugh
before he bashes them over
the head. Father, a keen home-
carpenter, is setting up a “do-
it-yourself” model of the Old
Bailey in the parlor. Mother,
otherwise all patient normality,
employs a woman, not to do
the housework, but to help
them with the eating-up. And
daughter keeps a skull on the
mantelpiece.
Apart from the craziness, the
show is of some interest for
the way it turns upside-down
—and inside-out —a number of
theatrical conventions. One
act, though, is just about long
enough, despite the ingenious
twist to the second part, when
the amateur carpenter finds
himself in the witness-box (he
hasn’t provided a dock) in his
own living-room. The legal
satire is clever and penetrating,
but literary and verbose,
enlivened only by the near-
burlesque of the acting. This
tongue -in - cheek approach
does not extend to the other
performers who go about their
pursuits with deadpan earnest-
ness.
To some extent, Simpson’s
grapeshot method must pay-
off, for everyone will find
something to tickle him, but
what it all adds up to is any-
body’s guess.
Notting Hill to Music
The union between Theatre
Workshop and Donald Albery
is, like rags and riches, an
alliance of opposites. More
disparate twain never met. Yet
each must be deeply grateful
to the other—Theatre Work-
shop for having been relieved
of debt and precarious living,
and Mr. Albery for a source
of new shows that is the envy
of his fellow-managers.
This playgoer has had harsh
words to say (and even harsher
thoughts) of Joan Littlewood’s
distinctly personal style of
production and has disagreed
violently with the tributes paid
to her unusual talents. He is
now ready to eat those words
and to applaud the distinction
of “Make Me An Offer” (New
Theatre).
Here is the best British
musical since the war ana
probably the only one to
compel the sophisticated
theatregoer to pay a second,
and a third, visit. The
essential reason for its appeal
is compounded of trueness to
life, goodnaturedness, style
and the indefinable quality
which only rarely makes the
whole greater than the sum of
its parts.
The book is by Wolf
Mankowitz, who knows his
background (the antiques
trade) and whose influence has
probably fused the crude ore
of the East End with the
burnished metal of the West
End. His setting is the street-
market in the Portobello Road,
so well-known to overseas
visitors, and his theme is,
simply, that honesty is not the
best policy for antique-dealers.
Monty Norman’s lyrics and
David Heneker’s music are
not, perhaps, able to stand
on their own with the Top
Twenty, but they are always
pertinent and are put over
splendidly, sometimes with
ingenuous didacticism, some-
times with sentiment and
always with wit.
The plot, such as it is,
concerns an earnest young man
of a surprising honesty and
love for the real thing (Wedg-
wood) who, to support his wife
and child, goes one better than
his very sharp and knowing
competitors. But the charm
of the show rests in the
carefully-worked-in detail, the
gentle satire, Miss Littlewood’s
witty yet restrained produc-
tion and the fact that the
players really act. The prin-
cipals are Daniel Massey (the
earnest young Cockney), Dilys
Laye (a highborn and purpose-
ful newcomer) and Martin
Miller (the cock o’ the market),
but the teamwork is so good
that the mention of names
seems invidious.
Theatre Workshop’s latest
move is a bold one. It has
commissioned Willis Hall (a
Yorkshireman) to write a play
about Ned Kelly.

A Piano in Tune
By
RAYMOND BARRY
The tall man walked up to
the shorter one in glasses
and spat. He rubbed the
spit into the ground with
the toe of his shoe.
“What are you doing here,
Lew?” he asked.
They were standing just over
from the horse-stalls. There
were people walking up and
down looking at the horses and
some stopping to lean on the
enclosure fence. You could
hear the bookmakers calling the
odds.
“Waiting for a bit of mail,”
Lew answered. He was about
twenty-five, short, solid and
had fair hair.
“Heard anything, Karl?”
“Had a tip for Silver Tail,
but if it wins I’ll eat it.”
“Couldn’t win,” Lew said.
He looked up at the other
man as he said it, squinting
through his glasses into the
sun. Karl was the same age,
but wore a more open expres-
sion. He was very well
dressed. He had on a dark-
blue suit, light-grey tie and
wore no hat. He had very dark
hair swept right back and was
good-looking.
“What’s the one you’re wait-
ing for mail on?” he asked.
“Mister Jones. I’m sweet
with young Atkins. His old
man owns it.”
“How’s it been?” Karl asked.
“Bad. I’ve had a chance with
Harry, but he can’t back a
winner. He's down to his last
two-spot. This is our escape
if I get the gee for it.”
Lew borrowed a cigarette. A
small boy led a tall brown horse
past with a number-five saddle-
cloth.
Karl flicked through the
pages of his racebook.
“That’s that old horse there,”
he said.
“Yes, that's him,” Lew said.
“God bless his soul.”
Just then a young man in a
grey-flannel suit called the man
named Lew aside. He spoke to
him quietly, gesturing with his
left hand, his binoculars
dangling from his arm. He left
Lew and went off in the direc-
tion of the betting-ring.
Lew took the tall man, Karl,
by the arm and led him in the
same direction.
“This one’s all right,” he
said, “if you want to have
something on it.” He was talk-
ing from the side of his mouth.
“Fancied?” Karl asked.
“They think it’s unbeatable,”
Lew said. “There’s fives,” he
said, pointing to a betting-
board.
“Thanks,” Karl said.
T ew headed off towards a
strip between the members’
stand and the main paddock
stand.
“I’ve got to find Harry and
send him into this,” he said.
“It’s Desperation Stakes.”
“Lew! ” Karl called after
him. “I want to see you after
the last. You can come back to
town with me if you like. ~ We
•might have a nice quiet night-
out.”
“Lovely,” Lew said.
“Might get to Harry’s,” Karl
said, “then back to my flat.”
“Not Harry’s,” Lew said.
“We’ll go somewhere where’s
there’s a floorshow —that’s if
we finish with something. At
the moment it looks like a shoe
and galosh.”
“Anyway, see you after the
last,” Karl said, and went off
into the ring.
In the strip between the two
stands Lew was stopped by a
tall man\ wearing a brown
cardigan and grey sports-
trousers.
“What’s doing, Lew?” he
asked.
“Hello, Merry-go-Round,”
Lew said. “Seen Harry?”
“He was here just a minute
ago,” the Merry-go-Round
said.
“He hasn’t done anything on
this, has he?” Lew asked.
“I don’t know to tell y’ the
truth, Lew,” the other man said.
“Why, y’ got a good tip?” He
spoke slowly and it seemed with
some difficulty.
“Yes, Merry, but I’ve got to
find Harry before he does the
wrong thing.”
“Here he comes,” Merry-go-
Round said slowly. “Mind if
I listen-in, Lew?”
“No, Merry-go-Round, but
keep it to yourself.”
“Certainly, Lew,” the tall
man said.
A MIDDLE - AGED man
approached in a brown
suit. He was small, rather fat
and wore a pained expression.
He was greying and had on
glasses and a fawn-colored
waistcoat.
“What’s happened?” he
asked, expressionless.
“This is right,” Lew' said.
“They’ve declared it unbeat-
able.”
The tall man listened with
his mouth open.
Harry looked across towards
the rails-bookmakers and
reached into his pocket.
He produced a roll of ten-
pound notes and handed them
to Lew.
“Here’s the two,” he said.
“Better have it on it. Quick,
before the fives goes off.”
Lew moved quickly towards
the bookmakers and the tall
man moved off in stride with
him. He leaned down to talk
softly to the man called Lew.
“What did you say it was,
Lew?” he asked.
“Mister Jones, Merry-go-
Round,” Lew said. “But don't
run round telling everyone on
the course.”
“I won’t do that, Lew,” the
tall man said.
Lew brought back a ticket
and handed it to Harry.
Harry had several businesses,
most of them connected with
gambling, and a type of night-
club. He had a good deal of
money, but bet in large sums
at the races and often lost.
He also gave a lot away, mostly
to brokes. This made him very
popular.
Both the man called Lew and
Harry had binoculars. They
put them to their eyes to watch
the horses on their way to the
start. They stood with a group
of other men on a small mound
that was on the winning-post
side and slightly in front of the
main paddock stand.
“Whatta y’ done, Harry?” a
man standing near asked.
“Backed that brown thing,”

he said. “Mister Jones.”
“Jeezers, you got a big
heart,” the man said. “It’s an
awful cat.”
“I got a big heart,” Harry
said quietly.
Lew laughed and took down
his glasses to look round at the
man.
“What would you know?”
the men around asked the man
who had asked Harry the ques-
tion. “You’ve never sorted out
a winner in your life,” they said.
“You are dead-set a maiden at
the tip,” one of the men said.
They were teasing him. Most
of them were big men and on
Harry’s staff.
C|oon the broadcaster
announced that the field
was going into line. He said
they would soon be racing.
When they jumped the
course - broadcaster called
Mister Jones slow to leave.
“Bloody kids!” Harry said
quietly. “That’s what you get
backing apprentice-kids.”
“He’s all right,” the man
called Lew said. “This kid
knows what he’s doing.”
At the half-mile the boy on
Mister Jones had moved his
mount up on the fence into
fifth place. The leader had a
two-lengths’ break and the rest
of the field was bunched.
“Hard to beat now if he gets
a smack at them,” Lew said.
“He’s going well,” Harry said
quietly.
He moved away to the side
to sight the field as they made
towards the turn.
When they straightened for
home the favorite, Swan Lake,
shot clear. All the men around
declared him the winner and
some women on the lawn began
to jump up and down.
The boy on Mister Jones
was lying third, trying to push
out off the fence. The second
horse was beaten and could
make no ground on Swan Lake
at the furlong. Mister Jones
was making a run.
Inside the furlong the boy
had pulled Mister Jones wide to
go past the second horse and
was riding hard, hands-and-
heels. Mister Jones was
responding well; he raced
alongside the leader and the
two of them raced to the post
together, Mister Jones getting
the better of it.
Harry turned to Lew and
said, “You’ve got your piano.”
Lew laughed.
The boy drove Mister Jones
past the favorite on the line
to win by threequarters of a
length.
Everybody around patted
Harry on the back, and most of
them said what a good race the
boy had ridden and things like
that. Harry called Lew aside
and pressed a ten-pound-note
into his hand.
“There’s a drinking-bank,”
he said, “to go on with.”
T ew met the tall man, Merry-
go-Round, on his way out
of the course. It had been the
last race.
“Get on it?” he asked.
“Yes, thanks, Lew,” the tall
man said. “Five-pound to one,
I had.” He seemed very
happy. “Where you drinking
t’night?” he asked. “I want to
buy you a drink,” he said
slowly.
“Some other time, thanks,
Merry-go-Round,” Lew said.
“I’ve got a bit of business to
do tonight.”
At the gate near the horse-
floats he met the man called
Karl.
“Back it?” he asked.
“No, had a big tip for the
favorite and switched,” the
man Karl said. “Wouldn’t
believe it, would you? Have
a big day if I back it. I backed
three other winners.”
“Harry get out?” Karl asked.
“Had a thousand to two-spot
the last,” Lew said, “but lost
two-spot on the day. That’s a
good day for him.”
The two men got into a grey-
and-white Holden Karl owned.
“You know that Harry’s
giving me a piano for my kids,”
Lew said.
“A piano! ”
“Yair. You wouldn’t believe
it. I was just telling him earlier
in the day that the kids were
asking me about a piano. You
know I couldn’t afford a
second-hand piano-stool,” he
said. “Well, when that lasti
horse won he turned to me and
said ‘You’ve got your piano.”*
“That’s all right, eh,” Karl
said.
“It’ll be a beauty for the
kids,” Lew said.
They drove out on to the
road and into a stream of
traffic.
“You right for tonight?”
Karl asked.
“Yair, sweet,” Lew said.
“You got a bird?” -
“Jean. What about you?”
“I can get that sheila from
the pub,” Lew said.
“You going to finish at my
place?” the man called Karl
said.
“If it’s sweet,” Lew said.
“Of course it’s sweet. But
what’s your missus going to
say? She’ll bellow, won’t she,
if you don’t lob home?”
“Oh, it’ll be sweet,” the man
called Lew said, “when I tell
her about the piano in the
morning.”


THE PENMAN
By
JACK LUSBY
Kain was as thin as a
brush-handle and had
a wild shock of red
hair and the whitest
face you ever saw.
One of our art - school
models was Pete Stirrup, who
had about the blackest face
you ever saw. Kain liked to
talk with Pete during rests,
and beside Pete’s stone-age
coloring and contours, Kain’s
drawn, white face under that
red hair looked like something
from another planet. His drab
brown suit hung on his long,
puppet-jointed body like on a
coat-hanger and he often wore
fiery-bright tan boots.
They were depression years
and Kain at first made a
scanty living pen - drawing
meticulous little bookplates
and book-illustrations. When
things were unusually bad he'd
labor on a council gang, and
he’d cast about as much shade
as his long-handled shovel.
Kain always turned-up at
night-class. You could hear
his spindly legs ramrodding
up the old stairs and those
bright-tan boots squeaking
like young pigs. To stifle
comment he used to halt on
the studio threshold and glare
ferociously all round before
squeaking to his easel.
One night when he did this
a doubled-over sandwich fell
from a pocket, straightened
out revealing a bite out of
the middle and rolled across
the floor to the feet of the
model. Kain pursued it
shouting “Whoa! The work-
man’s lunch!” and calmly
consumed it before turning to
his sketch.
No little things perturbed
him.
Nor did Jules’s acid and
violent objections to Kain’s
faint pencillings. Jules liked
you to gvab a stick of black
charcoal, stand back at arm’s
length and draw boldly. Then
with his failing eyesight he
could spot your errors. He
had to put his old, wise face
to within a nostril-hair of
Kain’s grey drawing and study
it bit by bit.
“Exhibit this at Oodna-
datta,” Jules said one night.
“Why?” said Kain.
“Only a blacktracker could
follow it!”
TJut Kain’s lines were simply
" groundwork for his im-
mensely detailed, punctilious
penmanship. Kain began to
apply this, in due course, to
subjects more expansive than
his tiny book-illustrations. He
applied his bird-eyed pen to
buildings, and sold some of
the results to the proprietors.
Next he was to be seen, a
clatter of gear over one
shoulder, stalking through
Sydney’s Hyde Park and set-
ting himself up facing St.
Mary’s Cathedral. He occu-
pied the same pitch every day
for weeks. Park habitues from
time to time left their benches
and gathered behind Kain in
a tatterdemalion half-circle,
watching the progress of a
drawing almost as monumen-
tal as the cathedral itself.
Young Beatrice from the art
class sat beside Kain and
watched for an hour, en-
tranced.
“It’s fascinatin g—and
frightening!” she gushed later.
“His concentration! I swear
he puts an ounce of himself,
a hundred corpuscles, into
every stroke. When that draw-
ing's finished there’ll be no
Kain!”
Finished it was. A pen-
drawing about three-feet by
two. While holding all the
majesty of a noble edifice, it
seemed to show the crinkles in
every stone. It showed that
the thing was built stone by
stone. It showed the minute-
ness of men against something
men had built. Men who, in
the drawing, bustled and
scurried heedlessly around
their building as ants might
scurry around their anthill.
At the monthly showing of
students’ work the student
critics walked around Kain's
drawing much as they might
have walked around its
cathedral. The effort in it
stunned the mind.
“The industry shown appals
me!” said one critic. “But it
has something.”
“It shows real affection for
architecture,” essayed another.
“I like the people! ”
fumbled a third.
“I like the frame,” said
Jules. He hated meticulous
work.
Kain had not quite fulfilled
young Beatrice’s prophecy. He
took the drawing down,
wrapped it up and went home.
IT" ain at this time seemed to
live in a contagious ten-
sion. Drinking coffee with
him in some cheap place after
night-class we’d feel ourselves
tightening-up. Kain used to
tell hard little jokes and there’d
be hard little laughs.
Sometimes he indulged in
diabolical mimicry. He had
Jules down to a T. He’d put
a fat pencil in his mouth,
cigar-like, hold a menu within
an inch of his nose and,
wrinkling his face, peer at
every square inch of it.
“I don’t like the printing,”
he’d announce.
“Well don't eat the bloody
printing!” Beatrice exploded
once. “Have coffee and
sausages like everyone else.”
Beatrice used to hang on
Kain’s every pen-stroke, but
she loved old Jules.
Kain had another made-to-
order victim. Fenton was a
rough-hewn bushman who’d
left Queensland to learn art
and who worked by day in
the abattoirs. He had a habit
when drawing of thrusting his
thumbs so forcefully into his
trouser - pockets that his
trousers, pretty low-slung any-
way, seemed in real danger of
coming right off. In this peri-
lous position Fenton would
crinkle his brow and almost
wring his neck twisting his
head from model to drawing
in great mental anguish. A
sitter for Kain.
Then there was Simmo,
Jules’s assistant. Simmo
walked with a rolling lurch
caused by an old war wound,
and his speech held all the
glottal stops of Glasgow. He
used to patrol like a tug in
a steep sea behind the row of
easels. When he paused be-
hind one he’d freeze into
immobility, often with an
alarming list to port, and sub-
ject the drawing to such in-
tense and silent scrutiny that
the student’s nerves usually
played - up. At this stage
Simmo gave vent to a crack-
ling stream of Glasgowese and
rolled and pitched away. For
Simmo’s speech Kain simply
used an unintelligible lot of
monkey-sounds that bore a
startling resemblance.
The Sydney Harbor Bridge
was being built, and its arches
reached nearly 400 ft. into the
sky. People were betting the
two soaring arcs wouldn't
meet.
Kain left that problem to
the designers. He humped his
shoulder-load of equipment to
the foreshores and sat there
day after day staring at the
tremendous filigree of steel,
penetrating its infinite intri-
cacies and preparing another
and bigger astonishment in
pen-and-ink. He’d come a

long way from bookplates —-
even from cathedrals.
ON a day - off from the
abattoirs Fenton hied him-
self to the scene with Beatrice
and a couple of bottles of beer
for the toiler.
“I was stonkered after
watching for a few minutes,”
Fenton told us. “Had to lie
down and have a breather.
He’s doing every bloody rivet.”
“How big’s the drawing?”
“He’s broken it into sections
—traces ’em somehow onto
the master job in his room. I
reckon it’ll be as big as a
kitchen table.”
“Jeez, he’ll kill himself this
time! ”
And that was the general
consensus. But Kain’s time
hadn’t come. He seemed in-
destructible. He finished this
colossal drawing. A brand-
new pair of yellow, squeaking
boots gave us our first hint
that he’d sold it to the makers
of the bridge. When he shouted
six of us dinner with wine at
Piero’s we knew for certain.
“And I’m not finished with
the bridge,” he announced at
this function.
“Not finished! I thought
you'd have had a bellyful!”
“Whatd’you mean, Kain?”
“Job’s driven him nuts.”
“Nuts and bolts,” Fenton
finished for us.
“By God, Fenton, you came
close to it,” said Kain. “I’m
a riveter now. Blokes who
bought the drawing wangled
it. Gets me way up on top
of the bridge.”
“You are crazy, Kain!”
cried Beatrice. “Two men fell
off there and were killed!”
“And they were used to it,”
said someone.
“I’ve been up a few times
already, just to get used to
it. I find I’ve got a good head
for heights.”
“Well, what’s the idea?”
“The idea?” Kain seemed
surprised at the question. “To
study the whole city, you
bloody mutts. To soak-in the
whole layout.”
His thin little mouth pursed
in a caricature of smugness.
Over the white cheekbones
the pale eyes gleamed with
ambition. He ran skeleton
fingers through the flame of
red hair.
“Why not buy an > aerial
photo?”
“Not the same. No atmo-
sphere. Might use one later
for detail.”
So that was that. Kain was
launched on about the biggest
thing his mind could encom-
pass.
TTe continued to come to the
night-class, continued to
yarn with black Pete Stirrup
during rests when Pete was
there. The only outward evi-
dence of days spent high in
the air were a few furtive
freckles clinging precariously
to nose and cheekbones.
He was regarded with a lot
of awe. But not by Jules.
“It’s marvellous up there,
Freddie, marvellous ! ” Kain
was enthusing to the bloke at
the next easel. “You can see
Sydney spread out all around
—harbor, parks, buildings like
dolls’ houses, streets like deep
gutters through the city . . .”
“And you're going to draw
it?” Jules cut in like a knife
behind them.
“Every bloody brick!” Kain
snapped back.
“Well, Marie’s posing there.
Draw her. Every bloody
muscle! ”
Jules replaced his cigar and
moved along the line of easels.
For many weeks Kain
worked on the bridge, moving
higher and higher on the south
arch, and studying the city
spreading more and more re-
vealingly below. For many
weeks he abandoned the night-
class. Beatrice gave us a few
progress reports. Kain’s room,
she said, was littered with
pads of minute notes, made at
odd times on the bridge, and
a few photographs. On the
walls were pinned dozens of
larger sketches made while
memory was fresh. And on
Kain’s desk was growing a
truly amazing pen-drawing.
Then, on one of the nights
set aside for a showing of
students’ work, Kain’s familiar
frenzied footsteps sounded on
the stairs. He burst into the
studio with a burden. Un-
packed, it turned out to be a
sft.-wide panorama of the
city as seen from 400 ft. up.
You fumbled for understand-
ing until you grasped what
Kain had done. It was not a
drawing of one view. It was
as though a movie-camera had
swung in a wide arc. You
swung your eye around the
drawing in the same way. Its
sky was alive with light, its
water sparkled, its nearer
streets were grim canyons
through the city. It had soft
distances and a forceful fore-
ground.
It all came out of Kain and
a handful of ink bottles. It
left us dumbfounded.
I looked anxiously at Kain
as Jules moved slowly along
the line of work, studying each
piece and commenting. He
stood back from Kain’s job at
first and donned his glasses—
a rare thing. Kain’s white face
was as bleak as I’d ever seen if.
Jules moved forward and
studied the drawing closely,
fidgeting with his cigar. There
was absolute silence.
“I should be very proud to
have done this,” was all Jules
said.
He waved his cigar in what
could have been a salute be-
fore moving on to the next
piece.
"Cor the next two or three
■*- weeks Kain came regu-
larly again to the night-class.
He’d sold the last drawing,
too, to the makers of the
bridge, and they’d put it on
show in the city.
Newspapers drew attention
to it.
Then Kain’s appearances
became spasmodic. Over coffee
he became moody. There was
no more mimicry.
Finally he ceased to come
at all.
Beatrice was in distress one
night. “I went to look him
up,” she told us, “and he
wasn’t home. The landlady
hasn’t seen him for days. I’m
worried.”
“Aw, he’s probably moved,”
someone said. “He’ll turn up.”
“But all his things are there.
And he’d have told me!
Something’s wrong, I tell
you!”
Simmo had lurched within
hearing and was understood
to voice complete agreement
with Beatrice. Perhaps Simmo
had understood Kain.
Pretty soon the police were
alerted and a search began.
Kain’s striking face looked
out at us from the papers.
His drawings had made him
a celebrity. People from all
over the t compass claimed to
have seen him. A woman
clairvoyant phoned the police
and told them where to find
the body.
Strangest of all, Simmo and
Pete Stirrup went on safari —
a blacktracking expedition.
They started from an outlying
township whence a likely
report had come, and spent
days and nights in the bush.
Real hardship for Simmo with
the gammy leg. But they re-
turned with only a fund of
funny stories.
But Kain was found. We
were discussing this over food
that seemed tasteless when
Fenton made an observation.
“I’ll bet it was just that he’d
run out of subjects,” he said.


PROFESSORS INVADE THE HOME
Science in Eruption
In what is loosely being called the
Electronic Age, the Nuclear Age
and the Atomic Age, one thing at
least is indisputable—the “ordinary
people” have become more science-
minded.
This is not to say they have become
more scientific, either in their knowledge
or in their approach to life. Pseudo-
sciences flourish as much as ever.
Astrology is probably stronger than at
any time since Dean Swift was thought
to have given it its death-blow with his
“Prediction for the Year 1708.” And
the lottery, one of the most unscientific
ways ever devised of not making money,
has more devotees in Australia than
at any time in its history.
But there is, at any rate, a growing
awareness of the importance of science
in everyday life. As far as Australia
is concerned the man who has probably
done more than any other to awaken
this interest is Professor Messel, whose
drive and energy have lifted the Sydney
University School of Physics into
world-class. At the same time he has
managed to infuse some of his own
enthusiasm into the business community
of Sydney, with gratifying results,
financially, to the study of science in
general and to the School of Physics
in particular.
Professor Messel was one of the first
to draw attention to the big disparity
between the numbers of scientists and
engineers being trained in Russia and
in the Western countries. That his
emphasis on the importance of
mathematics and physics in modern
science is getting results is shown by
figures he quoted last week. Two years
ago there were 19 graduates in third-
year physics at Sydney University. In
1959 there were 71.
’T'hree years ago, as part of a plan to
JL raise the teaching - standards of
science-classes in secondary schools,
Messel instituted the Summer School of
Science at Sydney University, at which
selected science-teachers from State and
private schools were enabled to hear
lectures by top-rank scientists from Aus-
tralian and overseas universities.
Teachers who have attended these
lectures have been high in their praise
of the Summer School and it cannot be
doubted that their students (in more
than 100 schools each year) have shared
the benefit.
In the latest School, arranged
by Professors Messel and Butler (Pro-
fessor of theoretical Physics at Sydney
University)' the course comprised 27
lectures, on various aspects of the general
subject “From Nucleus to Universe” and,
in addition to leading Australian
scientists, those enrolled for the course
American scientists Professor G.
Gamow, of the University of Colorado,
and Professor T. Gold, of Cornell Uni-
versity, N.Y.
The scope of this Summer School
was vastly extended when a Sydney TV-
station undertook to telecast the principal
lectures each morning throughout the
course. The popularity of this move
to bring science to the home astounded
its sponsors. Evidence of this popu-
larity was given to The Bulletin by a
woman whose TV-set went on the blink
on the second day of the series. When
she phoned her repair-service man and
asked if he could have the set working
by 11 a.m. he replied, “Aw, I suppose
you’re another of these housewives that
wants to watch the atoms.”
Science comes in many guises and
scientists in many shapes. The
popular conception of a scientist used
to be a small bloke with thick glasses
forever holding a test-tube up to the
light or peering into a microscope. This
figure has now been replaced by a
man in a white coat who spends his
time making rockets and H-bombs by
the apparently simple process of writing
short but complicated equations on, a
blackboard. To most people science now
means sputniks, luniks, rockets, atomic-
powered ships and planes, shots at the
moon, space-travel, flying saucers and,
in gloomier moments, H-bombs. These
are the spectacular aspects of current
scientific endeavor and accordingly are
the ones most often featured in the press.
In popular opinion the rocket recently
fired by Russia into the mid-Pacific was
probably a fantastic advance upon any
previous development in its class. As
was pointed out in B. 27/1/'6O, there
was nothing to suggest that it was vastly
superior, either in range or accuracy,
to the U.S. Atlas rockets test-fired from
Florida to Ascension Island in the South
Atlantic.
Up to the present only Russia and
the U.S. have been successful in putting
artificial satellites into orbit and only
Russia has hit the moon, but they are
not likely to enjoy their monopoly of
for long. Last month U.K.
Aviation Minister Duncan Sandys told
the Royal Aeronautical Society that
although Britain had not yet decided to
undertake an independent programme of
space-exploration it already had equip-
ment capable of putting up a satellite.
A combination of the Blue Streak rocket
and the Black Knight research-vehicle,
with a small additional rocket-stage
“could provide the thrust needed to put
a satellite into orbit or send a 2001 b.
weight to the moon.” The Blue Streak,
designed to travel 2500 miles, was to be
tested at Woomera, where the Black
Knight had already been fired and had
reached a height of 500 miles. Another
tested at Woomera and had made obser-
vations at heights up to 100 miles.
At the Summer School Dr. D. F.
Martyn, chairman of the Australian
Space Research Committee, also men-
tioned the Skylark. He told his audience
(and the housewives and others watch-
ing on TV) of plans, to launch Skylarks
or Australian-designed Long Toms into
space from Woomera within six months
of getting Cabinet approval. In addi-
tion, the U.S. space-agency had agreed
to include Australian-designed and -built
radio-transmitters in its Scout satellites
to go into orbit next year. Australian
technicians, said Dr. Martyn, had
reduced the size of this radio equipment
from that of a medium - sized cabinet”
to the size of a jam-tin.
Other countries also plan to hitch-hike
their way into space. Russian Professor
Blagonravov has revealed that French
scientists would like to have a French
satellite launched by a Soviet rocket and
there is a likelihood of a joint Soviet-
Chinese sputnik. Blagonravov himself
has his sights fixed on Mars
and Venus. American space-scientist
R. W. Porter told the international
space conference at Nice that America
would send into orbit a capsule
built by Canada, “possibly this year,”
and that this would be followed by U.S.
firings of satellites produced by France,
Australia, Japan and “perhaps other
nations.” All this suggests that within
a few years the space-roads will be clut-
tered up with international ironmongery
and that space-monkeys will have to be
very good linguists.
Summer - scholars and housewives
alike were probably gratified to be told
(by Dr. C. B. McCusker) that in cosmic-
ray research Australia is far more
advanced than Russia. They were in-
terested to hear Dr. Alan Weiss, of the
C.5.1.R.0. radio-physics division, after
scorning the suggestion that atom-bomb
explosions could affect rainfall, give it
as his opinion that the passage of the
earth through a shower of meteors might
very likely result in increased rainfall.
The highlights of the lecture-series
were probably the rival theories of the
origin of the universe, propounded by
Professors Gamow and Gold. Gamow
holds that in the beginning all the matter
in the universe was tightly squeezed
together in a hot mass and that about
5000-million years ago it exploded with
“a big bang” and has been expanding
ever since. “Not so,” says Professor
Gold, who maintains that although stars
come and go and galaxies change in
detail, the universe as a whole has
always been much the same as it is now.
Neither scientist referred to the theory
advanced a short time back that life
on the earth may have evolved from
germs left behind in litter by space-
travellers who staged on this planet
en route to some-place-else millions of
years ago. It’s rather a sobering thought
that we may be descended from the dirt
on somebody’s lunch-wrappers, but it
provides a very good reason why trippers
should destroy all litter before leaving
the picnic-site.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND ITS
RED MILL RUM.
At Randwick
Brought over from Perth,
Olympiad cleared out with the
A.J.C.’s £2OOO Challenge Stakes
at Randwick last Saturday in
1.1 It —average time, but there
had been light overnight rain.
A five-year-old entire by Port
Vista (imp.) from Wonderlight,
Olympiad was bred in N.S.W.
and has won in the best sprint
company in Perth, on one
occasion beating a Flying Han-
dicap field at the Ascot track
there by 10 lengths. His dam
produced several other good
winners, including Confession,
Wonderland and Wonder Star,
and Olympiad comes from the
family which produced Gloam-
ing. He’s raced by Mrs. I.
Gianatti, trained by J. A.
Thomas and was ridden by
Perth jockey C. McLauchlan —■
a W.A. victory all the way.
McLauchlan reduced weight by
several pounds on a Sydney
day that should have been hot
enough without any Turkish-
bath, but he was still a couple
of pounds over at 7.9.
• • • •
Olympiad’s success further
proved that Perth sprinting
form is usually worth keeping
an eye on at this time of the
year. In recent seasons W.A.
speedsters Maniana (Carrington
Stakes), Raconteur (Villiers)
and Filipino (Villiers) have
lifted top midsummer stake-
money. While Olympiad eased
a few points in betting on the
Challenge, Front Cover, who
had won the Carrington in
1.9 9/10 (course-record time)
at his prior start, firmed from
evens to 7 to 4 on. Olympiad
outclassed him, and the usual
outburst because Front Cover
had failed was utter rubbish.
It was obvious to anyone focus-
ing binoculars on Front Cover
that the hot favorite was hard-
ridden down the straight, and
was making no impression on
the visitor.

Thoroughbred breeder Alex
Higgins, of Piercefield Stud,
Muswellbrook (N.S.W.), de-
clined the bid of 600gns. for
Royal Courage when that
youngster was offered as a
yearling at the Randwick sales
last Easter, and the brother to
Bardshah repaid the compli-
ment by easily winning the
A.J.C. Sunnyside Maiden for
colts and geldings, first-money
for which was about £lOO more
than the bid. Higgins secured
him at bargain-rates in the first
place, too, paying only 180gns.
for the dam, Camshah, when
she was in foal to Royal
Empire (imp.). The colt looks
like developing staying-power,
and is certainly bred on the
right lines for it. His older
brother, Bardshah, won the last
A.J.C. St. Leger and was a good
third in the Sydney Cup. By
“He’s a cockatoo from our local two-up school.”
way of odd coincidence,
breeder-owner Morrie Point
declined the bid (250gns.) for
Bardshah at the Randwick
yearling-acution in 1957. The
dam of the brothers wasn’t
raced.

Having his first Sydney ride
since a flying-trip home from
France, mixing business with
pleasure, George Moore won
the opening Randwick event,
the Sledmere Maiden for two-
year-old fillies, on Winnipeg,
from the T. J. Smith stable.
Winnipeg was uneasy in bet-
ting, going from 7 to 2 to 7 to
1, but was always close to the
lead and won on her merits,
plus hard riding by the vigor-
ous Moore, who got her there
by the bare head in front of
Distinction. The winner is by
Pride of Kildare (imp.) from
Winning Flight by Winning
Hit from Francolin by Paper
Money (imp.), and carries the
colors of her New Zealand
breeders, D. H. Blackie and
L S. Otway. Winning Flight
has thrown other winners, in-
cluding Dixie (16 firsts and
£15,195 in stakes) and Mil-
waukee (£6025). Tulloch was
bred at the same stud, Tre-
lawney, Cambridge, as were
many other good ones. Pride
of Kildare is the sire of Caul-
field Guineas winner Prince
Lea.

All set for a first-up win,
Merry Polly was taken out of
the Challenge to run in the
Valicare race
for three-year-old fillies, and
named after a good one of
other years, duly proving what
it looked —a soft snap for her.
As there were four prizes, all
starters in the Valicare shared
in the hand-out. Merry Polly
had won at her previous two
Randwick starts also.

Adolph Basser’s colors
(brown and dark-blue hoops,
red cap) were successfully
carried by Happy Kingdom in
the Paddington Handicap—but
only just! All the way up the
straight the lighter-weighted
outsider All Salute kept the
favorite hard at it, and N.
Sellwood had to use full vigor
to land the money by only
about an inch. It was Happy
Kingdom’s first attempt in
open company, and under the
Welter conditions the three-
year-old did pretty well to
win with 9.6. Basser deserved
the win. Day before the race
he had made one of his very
generous donations —this one
to the Royal Alexandra Hos-
pital for Children.
Nice proportion of casualties
ascribed to the heatwave at
last week’s Kembla Grange
meeting: 1 jockey; 2 book-
makers ; 14 punters. Inter-
viewed on the snot, one of
those doing all the hard yakka
drawlingly neighed, “I couldn’t
care less.”
• • • •
Among the Kembla winners
was Johnnie’s Ghost, two-year-
old half-brother to Grey Ghost,
now about to show his paces
in America (his Australian
wins included the Doomben
Ten Thousand). Johnnie’s
Ghost won the Maiden for
juveniles. Bred at Puen Buen
Stud, Scone (N.S.W.), the
youngster (trained at Warwick
Farm by Jim Barker, who will
be in the U.S. with Grey
Ghost) is by Good Brandy
(imp.) from Tetrinia by Tetra-
tema (E.).
Despite Jeremiahs to the
contrary, racing still has plenty
of kick in it, and evidently
plenty of horses to help it kick.
The A.J.C. received a record
nomination of 123 for the
£6OOO Doncaster Handicap
(one mile; Saturday, April
16), and 98 for the £12,500
Sydney Cup (two miles ; Mon-
day, April 18). The best horses
from all States and from New
Zealand figure in the lists,
suggesting that there’ll be even
better autumn racing than
usual at Randwick this year.
The carnival this time includes!
the very promising-looking
Centenary Invitation Stakes,
run over 12 furlongs, with
£10,250 prizemoney. It high-
lights the opening day (Satur-
day, April 9). Then, on the
second day (Wednesday, April
13), the stayers have another
good one to contest —the £3OOO
Queen Elizabeth Stakes (w.f.a.;
If mile) —with yet another on
the third day—the £2500
Autumn Stakes (12 furlongs at
w.f.a.). The £7OOO Sires’ Pro-
duce Stakes and the £2500

“Monty”: Southern punters
could well note West Glance’s
latest win at Albion Park. This
fellow has notched five wins
from five starts on the sand —
and a champion there can be
a champion indeed. Certainly
old Auction will not have been
forgotten. Just about un-
beatable on the sand. Remem-
ber him lumping 10.12 and
winning the Doomben Ten

Albion in 1942? Yes, autumn
visitors shouldn’t overlook
West Glance for the old sand

writer John Rickman ranks
Bernborough among such
mighty champions as Ribot,
Man o’ War and Hyperion. In
America Bernborough sired the
winners of more than $3-million
in his first ten crops. In the
U.K. one of his offspring, Hook
Money, won £6600 (sterling)
in nine wins. Hook money,
who won the Ayr Gold Cup in
record time, will have his first
crop of two-year-old runners
this year. There may be a
Bernborough among them.

“P.0.M.C.”: As recently
rightly noted here, many a
jockey certainly has lived to
regret reducing excessively.
Most notable instance I can
recall was Jack Toohey’s Don-
caster Handicap win, on
Karuma around 1924, after
taking off 71b. Clear last into
the straight, Toohey drove
Karuma so hard that the horse
snatched victory right on the
line ; his rider collapsing in the
saddle after passing the post.
Semi-conscious with a ruptured
spleen on returning to the
enclosure, Toohey was carried
to the scales and then rushed
to hospital. Although he
renewed his licence nearly a
year later, Toohey never rode
again. He died some years ago,
still a comparatively young
man.

Melbourne Horses
At time of writing there was
a good chance that Flemington
next Saturday would see both
Tulloch and Todman. If it
should come off the attendance
would gladden the heart of the
V.R.C. secretary, and if Tulloch
should make a comeback
attempt in the Blarney Stakes
every admirer of a good horse
in the country would have his
fingers crossed for the son of
Khorassan. What a magnet
he would be in the Centenary
Cup next November!
• • • •
Melbourne racegoers have
never had the pleasure of see-
ing Todman —the horse who
has come back. They know
enough about him, however,
to make him a raging-hot
favorite for the Lightning
Stakes (w.-f.-a.; five furlongs).
One can’t go past Todman to
win the race, but if the two-
year-old The Penciller has
come back from his spell as
good as he was in the spring
he should at least keep even
Todman moving. The Pen-
ciller strung together four wins
before his spell, and he’s an
outstandingly good colt. The
presence of the new Australian
5| - furlongs record - holder,
Small Time, adds interest to
an intriguing race. It won’t
hurt to remember that Ritmar
(a two-year-old filly) and Mist-
ing fa two-vear-old colt) have
won the Lightning in the last
two years. In fact, two-year-
olds are hard to beat at w.f.a.
in such a scamper as the
Lightning, but Todman is a
freak, and should win.
In the s|-furlongs Barton
Handicap at Caulfield last
Saturday the brilliant colt
Royal Artist, having his first
run since his failure in the
Caulfield Guineas last spring,
crossed the line with plenty in
reserve in 1.3 8/10, which
shaved a tenth of a second off
the Australian record set by
Adelina in the Oakleigh Plate
(run at Caulfield) in 1957, and
equalled in the same race the
following year by Dubbo. Be-
cause of his breeding—by Star
Kingdom from Canvas Back,
and thus a full brother to
Kingster—Royal Artist was a
costly colt at 4500 gns., but
Saturday’s win—his sixth from
eight starts —took stake-earn-
ings to £4900, a pleasing
reward for the courage of his
owner, Mrs. L. Ralph, in going
to what she paid for him.
But Royal Artist’s time must
have been the shortest-lived
record in Australian Turf his-
tory. He did not hold the
honors even long enough to get
his name in the record-books!
Just an hour and ten minutes
later Small Time won the
second heat of the Barton in
1.3 7/10, a tenth of a second
better than Royal Artist’s
effort. You would not find a
bookmaker with a good word
to say about either of them —
Small Time’s Saturday win was
his fourth in a row, and his
fifth from his last six runs! A
three-year-old Smokey Eyes
colt from Red Garter, he gets
his name from his diminutive
build, but weight has not
stopped him yet—he carried
8.8 on Saturday in open com-
pany.
• • • •
Racegoers at Caulfield ex-
pressed their opinion of Impul-
sive by sending the Landau filly
out a 3-to-l-on favorite in the
Starlet Stakes, and she won as
easily as her price indicated she
should. She had 9.4, but
Tommy Woodcock will now
plan her programme to avoid
handicaps in which she would
get a crippling weight.
If any further evidence were
needed of the extremely fast
state of the track following the
times run by Royal Artist and
Small Time it was provided
by Royal Somme in the
10-furlongs R. V. Gove Handi-
cap. Not even his owner, Ossie
Porter, would pretend that the
aged Royal Somme is anything
but an honest old plodder, yet
he won the Gove in 2.2 9 /10,
not so far outside the Aus-
tralian record of 2.16/10!
These days he’s the sole bearer
of the Porter colors.

Despite an eye-
brow - raising announcement
over the course amplifiers that
connections were not com-
pletely satisfied with the horse’s
condition (with consequent
drift in the betting, 7’s to 16’s)
the five-year-old Piping Time
gelding Orden started and duly
won the Hobart Cup mile)
at Elwick. Well-handled by
Victorian apprentice L. Har-
bridge, Orden beat two rank
outsiders, Volterra and Dia-
mondale, with the favorite,
Sir Blink’s half-brother Dark
Spot (5/2), winding-up in the
ruck. Orden has now won
seven of his last nine starts
here in Tassie, and should pick
up a race or two in Victoria,
where’s he’s to race shortly.
* * *
Racing luck hangs by a thin
thread. Last week Melbourne’s
good lightweight jockey Alan
Yeomans had the chance to
ride Orden in the Hobart Cup,
but he turned it down, pre-
ferring to ride at Pakenham.
At about the time Orden was
winning the Cup Yeomans had
a terrible fall at Pakenham,
and now lies gravely ill, suffer-
ing from chest and spinal
injuries, in the Austin Hospital.

Other Sports
Though beaten in the series
by only one Test (2-1, with two
drawn), India was, in fact, not
an equal opponent for Aus-
tralia, as it was on the defen-
sive for most of the time in
just about every Test. Alto-
gether Australia had a pretty
tough tour, and came out of
it well, winning both Pakistan
and India series. Toughness
included two of Australia’s
bowlers, Rorke and Kline, hav-
ing to return early through
illness; a batsman, Stevens,
spending the latter part of the
tour in a hospital bed; and
most of the others being off-
color at some time or other.
In the drawn fifth India Test
Lindwall’s first-innings score of
10 took his total runs in Tests
past 1500 —for him to become
the first player ever to achieve
the double of 1500 runs and
200 wickets in Test-matches.

“Zorok”: Three times in the
space of 14 days recently—
twice in the West Indies and
once in Sydney—a batsman has
been run-out off a no-ball in
a first-class game. Probably
would not happen on the
average once in five seasons, in
first-class cricket all over the
world. In the first Test v.
England, new West Indies
opener McMorris was run-out
for 0 by Gloucester off-spinner
Allen. A day or so later, in
Sydney, N.S.W. spin-bowler
Martin threw down the wicket
of S.A. batsman Hill after
Misson had been no-balled. Hill
swung at the ball, it went
behind the wicket, and he
started off; but Martin did a
smart bit of fielding. Jn
Trinidad's second innings v.
M.C.C. 10 days later again,
opener Corneal was run-out off
a no-ball, again by off-spinner
Allen. None of the batsmen
reached double-figures.
“Keima”: “Zorok” (B.
30 /12 / ’59) was right in saying
that Bobby Simpson’s two un-
conquered double-centuries in
succession are a Sheffield
Shield record, but two multiple
centuries in succession have
been made in Shield be-
fore. Bradman and Ponsford
would come to mind as
likely to have done so ; and,
sure enough, both have. In
1935-36 for S.A., Bradman
made 233 against Queensland
and 357 against Victoria in
successive innings (in the
innings before, he’d “failed”
against N.S.W. with a mere
117). In 1927-28 Ponsford
made 437 against Queensland
and 202 against N.S.W. in suc-
cessive knocks after also having
made a century (133) against
S.A. in his preceding innings.
After his 202 “Ponny” made
a mere 30-odd in the second
innings of the game, and then
in his next innings, against S.A.,
made 336 —three scores of 200
or more in five innings, with a
century in one of the others!
“Tom”: A lad who may one
day join those who have
repped in the top flights at both
cricket and football is young
Gareth Blades, of Harbord
(Sydney), a pupil of Manly
High School. Playing for
Manly-Warringah in the N.S.W.
Cricket Association A. W-
Green Shield (under 16) he
bagged 18 Northern Districts
wickets for 58 runs. His first-
innings figures were 10 for 14,
off 30 balls. He’s handy with
the bat, too ; and, as well, playsi
on the wing in his school’s
Rugby Union team and as full-
back in a district under-16
competition.

petitor in the recent Queens-
year-old Sally Fleming, taking
part in the sub-junior relay in

champion, Sally broke a record
held by Olympian Nancy Lyons
of being the youngest com-
petitor ; Nancy was nine.

“Veryl” : Hec Hogan’s seven
successive Australian 100yds.
titles were a really remarkable
achievement (B. 20/l/’6O). In
his first win, in 1952, he
toppled “the favorite and then
No. 1 Australian sprinter, John
Treloar. Hogan at one stage
was aiming at 10 successive
titles, but his “reign” came to
an end when he failed to’
qualify for the final in 1959 ;
he came fifth in a field of eight
in a heat. Hogan was not so
successful at the Games: third
in the 1954 Empire Games
final and third in the 1956
Olympic Games final, and he
failed to qualify for the final
at the 1958 Empire Games.
There seems to be a crop of
good young sprinters around at
the moment, worthy successors
to Hogan —Waters, present
national 100yds. champion,
Bevan Baker, Gale, Bursill and
(perhaps the one who’ll be the
best of the bunch) the new

Dennis Tipping.

first singles against Hughes 6-2, 3-6,

saved four match-points and went
on to defeat Shapter 5-7, 8-6, 6-1.
The doubles went to the Queens-

Margaret Smith caused the upset
of the Australian National Tennis
Championships at Milton, Brisbane,
when she accounted for Brazilian
Maria Bueno, winning in three well-
fought sets, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. She lost
two services in the early part of
the first set, but her long reach
and sound stroking enabled her to
recover many points at the vital
stages, and it was this ability that
gave her the first set and the chance
to win the match. It must be said
from Miss Bueno’s viewpoint that
she suffered finger cramps in the
third set, but she did not complain
while the match was in progress.
A true champion, although beaten.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
STRENGTH THROUGH REDUCTION
TTow to take Mr. Khrush-
chev’s surprise announce-
ment that Russia’s armed forces
would be cut by one-third
during the next two years?
Seven editorial reactions from
Britain:
London “Daily Express ” :
“It is a powerful, imaginative
gesture that sets the pace in
the pre-Summit manoeuvres. In
making it, Khrushchev con-
firms the immense stature as a
politician to which he has
grown. He has once again
stolen the show by seizing the
initiative on an issue of lasting
importance.
“Of course, it will be tempt-
ing to wave Khrushchev’s
announcement aside as a mean-
ingless gesture. After all, it
does not amount to much in
terms of military realities. This
is the age of the missile, not of
the foot-soldier. Khrushchev
has done no more than recog-
nise this obvious fact —and act
accordingly.
“The statesmen of the West
would be underestimating the
force of public opinion in their
own countries if they were to
take such a narrow view of
Khrushchev’s initiative. For
years it has been the object
of Western policy to challenge
the Russians man for. man,
bomb for bomb. Now let the
statesmen also match Khrush-
chev on the great issues of
peace.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“To suggest that the motive
for Mr. Khrushchev’s under-
taking has more to do with
internal needs than with peace-
loving sentiments is not to cast
doubt on the sincerity of his
desire for disarmament. Accord-
ing to Soviet figures the pro-
posed cut will save annually
the equivalent of the whole of
the British defence-budget.
Such a saving can only
strengthen the Russians in the
economic contest to which they
have challenged the West;
indeed, we should be wise to
recognise that disarmament in
the military field means for
them, sooner or later, rearma-
ment in the economic field.
“Determined as they are to
surpass the Americans in indus-
trial production and standards
of living, it is quite possible
that they regard the total-dis-
armament plan presented by
Mr. Khrushchev to the United
Nations in September [1959] as
one of the keys to supremacy.
For the time being, however,
they are proposing no more
than a reduction of forces to

slightly below the present
American figure of 2,435,000.
This would not affect their
special armed police-forces
amounting to 7-800,000, which
have no parallel in the United
States.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post”: “One point
emerges plainly from his
[Khrushchev’s] speech. Since
he is by nature an adroit and
skilful bargainer, he wants to
do more at the Summit Con-
ference than negotiate from a
position of superior physical
strength. He is anxious to
supplement this physical
strength with a moral advan-
tage, which costs him little and
indeed assists his country’s
.economic development. There-
fore he was able to make his
pledge of large - scale conven-
tional disarmament and de-
mobilisation, and thus deal
himself one of the strongest,
showiest diplomatic cards in the
pack. By announcing that the
Soviet Union will reduce the
strength of its armed forces
from 3,623,000 to 2,423,000 he
has made quite certain that
Western statesmen, when they
reach the conference-table in
the spring, will have been sub-
jected to months of intensive
propaganda demanding im-
mediate and large-scale reduc-
tions in their own conventional
forces. It is as neat a
manoeuvre as he has ever
executed, with considerable
undertones of sardonic humor
about it.”
* * *
London “Economist” : “The
programme he [Khrushchev]
announced would merely bring
Soviet armed manpower, in two
years’ time, down to 2,423,000,
a fraction less than the Ameri-
can level of today ; and it was
not immediately clear whether
his figures included the
internal-security and frontier-
forces, usually estimated to be
about 350,000 strong. He
added that the creation of a
new Territorial Army was also
being considered.
“More unexpected was his
violation of the long-established
rule that Soviet strength is never
revealed in absolute figures. He
gave the present strength of the
Army, Air Force and Navy
as 3,623,000, and the 1955
strength as 5,760,000. If these
are correct, the accepted
Western estimates in 1955 were
well below the actual figure;
and the latest Western estimate
of 3,900,000 is not far out.
Marshal Malinovsky will not,
even in 1962, be left with no
troops to review, as he [lately]
seemed to envisage. And Mr.
Khrushchev emphasised that
the Soviet forces, though
smaller in numbers, would be
stronger than ever in firepower.
‘Our armed forces have been
largely switched to rocket-
nuclear weapons. Today, the
Red Army possesses firepower
such as no other Army has ever
had.’ ”
* * *
Manchester “Guardian”:
“The cuts should if anything
enhance its [the Red Army’s]
efficiency. The day of millions
of Soviet infantrymen, over-
whelming in sheer numbers, is
passing. The Soviet ‘conven-
tional’ forces are, and will in-
creasingly be, highly mobile,
well trained and well equipped.
They will still be large and
compactly massed. At just
under two-and-a-half million,
and with the Navy and Air
Force much reduced, they can
go on facing the North
Atlantic Alliance not just with
22 divisions in East Germany
but with as many more in
reserve —and the reserves will
be just as good as the front
line. So the cuts do nothing
to inhibit Nato’s continuing
effort to build-up its own com
ventional forces to what they
ought to be.
“Mr. Khrushchev trusts that
the people of the Nato
countries will be so impressed
with his cuts that they will
press their Governments to
follow suit. As usual, he has
the advantage of being able
to make a single gesture where
the Western cuts have come
about through protracted dis-
cussion, not to say wrangles,
within the services and the
alliance. In fact, if these ex-
tremely substantial Soviet forces
are going to be stripped for
action, so should ours be.”
* * *
London “News Chronicle”:
“It would be naive to hail Mr
Khrushchev’s speech as usher-
ing in a period of goodwill. He
speaks fulsomely on the need
for disarmament, but on the
only test that matters —inter-
national inspection and control
—he is as evasive as ever.

Faith the
Future
Australia’s situation in the world—its place in
the Pacific, its proximity to Asia—is one element
that is inseparable from our nation’s future.
This relationship between a country’s geography
and its political progress—taking politics in that
broad general sense which has nothing to do with
parties—goes by a name. It is Geopolitics.
One of the great British exponents of
geopolitical theory in this century was the late
Sir Halford Mackinder, whose original thinking on
the subject has been proved amazingly prophetic
by events of the past fifty years.
In a recent article on Mackinder’s genius, Mr.
John Biggs-Davison, a British M.P., brought out a
profound truth. He said the world conflict has
shifted from strategy to economics—to the “struggle
for relative efficiency” (this was Mackinder’s
predictive phrase) in trade, aid, investment
and production.
We can see how true that is by looking out
and around. Efficiency has become the ultimate test
for systems, for nations and individuals.
In Australia the economic structure is still
forming, and we find heavily underlined this need
for a total and sustained efficiency.
Here, we may tell ourselves, we have an
economy well based on wool, meat, and other good
yields of the land; on an increasing mineral
production and an expanding industry.
We certainly have. But these visible strengths
have to be related always to the quality we exhibit
in using them. They are, to put it another way,
the lien that Fortune has given us, in time
and opportunity, on the proving of our own
efficient worth.
To give that a practical application, I believe
we have to get right away from the idea that
efficiency is something abstract. It is real, and
personal. It has to be woven into the whole
Australian fabric: through every individual action
and every national plan.
And it implies a clear understanding of the
role our country will play in the changing
importances that are coming to ourselves and Asia
and the Pacific, in this geopolitical and highly
“relative” world.
// L
speech marks a shift in
strategy, but not a change of
objective. Russia’s military
policy can now demonstrably
be based on a superiority of
nuclear weapons.
“The proof of whether im-
portant progress can be made
in improving international
relations will come at the
Summit in four months’ time.”
* * *
Edinburgh “Scots man” :
“Though Russia will naturally
try to reap as much advantage
in good opinions as possible
from the cuts in her forces,
the permanent suspension of
nuclear tests is much more
significant for the future of all-
round disarmament. Though
the American evidence on the
possibility of muffling under-
ground tests has been severely
criticised not only by Russian
scientists but also by inde-
pendent scientists in America
and elsewhere, there is no
reason why agreement should
not be reached forthwith for
a controlled ban on tests above
the surface. Russia refuses to
do this. It is, however,
virtually certain that no
nuclear explosion on or above
the ground could escape detec-
tion even now.
“An influential body of U.S.
opinion, including those scien-
tists who produced the evidence
on underground tests, makes no
secret of its desire to end the
ban. Rather than engage in
another futile wrangle on
German unity at the Summit,
the four leaders might well de-
vote themselves to this problem
on which agreement is well
Within reach.”
The Pinay Affair
A ll overseas papers to hand
_ seem to agree that the dis 4
missal of Antoine Pinay as
France’s Minister of Finance,
though it has not caused a
serious Cabinet crisis, brings
to the surface some deep
divisions within the de Gaulle
Government.
Sketching a background to
the dismissal, the “New York
Times” notes that “M. Pinay,
the solid bourgeois business-
man whose conservative fiscal
policies— plus a certain measure
°f good luck —have given to
France a financial stability
Within the past year that she
has not known in a generation
or more, found himself increas-
ingly at odds with Premier
Debre and the Government
over two major issues:
economic ‘liberalism’ and
foreign policy. The quarrel on.
either point is nothing new.
“A ‘liberal’ in the 19th-
century meaning of the term,
M. Pinay is in today’s context
a conservative believer in—
and practitioner of the
balanced Budget, economic
freedom, cautious monetary
policies, as few controls and as
as little Governmental inter-
ference as possible.
“The difference has been
obvious between his views and
the more Socialistically inclined
approach of an important wing
of the U.N.R. (the principal
Gaullist party), especially in
deciding how best to promote
economic growth, how to bring
labor into closer partnership
with management, how much
further the Government should
get into business, and so on.
“The appointment of Wilfrid
Baumgartner, long - time
governor of the Bank, of
France, to succeed M. Pinay
suggests that there will not be
too great a change in strictly
financial policy ; but there will
be a change in personality. It
can be expected that M.
Pinay’s dictum: ‘So long as I
am in office there will be no
inflation’ will be re-echoed by
the new regime.”
While agreeing with this
view, London “Daily Tele-
graph” adds that “M. Pinay has
been succeeded by a ‘techni-
cian,’ ” and that “although
such Ministers may be able
executives, they have no links
either with the Assembly or
with the political life of the
country”:
“This widening gap must be
a matter of concern to Presi-
dent de Gaulle. In conferring
power upon him, the French
people were not rejecting demo-
cracy, but only its abuses and
inefficiencies.
“The previous regime was
not all bad. It threw up
some very distinguished figures.
There were many ‘politicos,’
but some not unworthy of the
title of statesman. If the new
regime is to dispense with them,
one of the pillars of the Presi-
dent’s political faith —the con-
fidence of the people—will not
be strengthened.”
London “Economist” sees
M. Pinay’s departure as “a
capital event in the affairs of
the Fifth Republic”:
“With it, in all appearance,
French political life shifts into
a new gear. The President, in
the driving-seat, is now more
than ever alone: none of the
remaining figures around him
can be said to lead an inde-
pendent existence. As for M.
*


that he remains at their dis-
posal: the echo of an earlier
departure, to Colombey-les-
deux-Eglises in 1946, is not
meant to be missed.
“The Debre Government
thus declines a stage further
into an American-style (or per-
haps a Portuguese - style)
Cabinet. The permanent sec-
retaries are taking over. This
certainly ensures executive
cohesion, which never existed
while M. Pinay sat there. But
the concentration of authority
in the Elysee brings France
sensibly closer to government
by decree and referendum. The
Gaullist edifice has had the
scaffolding taken down; its
base turns out to be narrow;
it looks topheavy.”
The Manchester “Guardian”
expresses little surprise at this
Governmental topheaviness:
“From the first it was doubt-
ful how General de Gaulle
would continue to secure a firm
base in popular consent, since
his coming as a savior had
united people who differed
violently on fundamentals.
“Parliament in its present
shadowy form, dominated as it
is by men often less liberal than
the President, can do little to
provide this base ; the Presi-
dent must largely rely on his
own prestige to secure both
popular consent and Admini-
strative obedience—and in this
last he is not always successful.
“President de Gaulle, it is
said, has been moved by the
latest political trouble to think
of cutting-down still further
the machinery of Parliamentary
Government. If he does this
the task may become harder
still for a lonely figure but-
tressed by technicians.
“A possible alternative a
dissolution bringing in a new
and more representative Parlia-
ment —might mean in effect a
return to French political habits
on which the General has
turned his back. Yet his
present political sleight-of-hand
may have before it only a
limited run.”

Russia's Pacific Shots
'T'he “New York Times”
comments on Russia’s
announced intention to fire a
series of long-range missiles
into a target-area in the Central
Pacific:
“In language startling even
London “News Chronicle."
“STOP FIDDLING WITH MY LITTLE BACK WHEEL.”
in the space-age, the Soviets
declare that the purpose of
their target-practice is to test
even more powerful rockets ‘to
launch heavy earth-satellites
and undertake space-flights to
planets of the solar system,’
which would mean not merely
the moon but possibly Mars
and Venus.
“If this sounds like futuristic
fantasy there is nothing
futuristic about their state-
ment that they use for this
purpose ‘ballistic rockets’
which can also be used for
military purposes.
“All this gives new validity
to tbe nagging question
programme outlined by Presi-
dent Eisenhower is really
adequate. The Soviet rockets
which launched the sputniks
and luniks were already twice
as powerful as the best we
have, and, while the Atlas is
powerful and accurate enough
to hit close to a target five- to
six-thousand miles away, the
Soviets may well be able to
increase their present lead.
“The Soviets have selected a
target-area in the Central
Pacific, where the United
States conducts some of its
experiments. The Eurasian
expanse of Soviet Russia, some
6000 miles across Siberia, might
seem wide enough for all neces-
sary experiments, and to reach
the Central Pacific the Soviets
may have to shoot across the
air-space of China, Korea and
Japan, but they are apparently
determined to do so to serve
notice that the Pacific is not
an American lake.
“In its own missile-ranges
from Cape Canaveral to
Ascension Island in the
Atlantic and from Vandenberg
Air Base in California to
Eniwetok in the Pacific the
United States shoots only over
international waters or its own
trust-territory, but having set
some sort of precedent it does
not propose to protest so long
fined to international waters.
What other countries, possibly
affected by the Soviet tests, will
do is something that remains
to be seen.”
In the New York “Herald
Tribune” Joseph Alsop adds
that the projected series of
missile-shots will not by any
means be the first the Russians
have made:
“The American watching-
stations have long since tracked
at least two and perhaps more
Soviet long-range missile-shots
with Pacific Ocean target-
areas ; but there has been no
official mention of them,
because the American Gov-
ernment, as usual, was oblig-
ingly trying to keep the
Kremlin’s secrets from the
American people.
“But a combination of two
facts sets the new test-series
apart from the earlier Soviet
Pacific shots. The first fact is
simply the announcement itself.
The second fact is the stated
Soviet purpose to send to the
target-area a large number of
Soviet naval vessels in order to
observe the results of the shots.
This naval movement, pretty
plainly, is what made the
announcement necessary.”
U.S. Defence Position
The announcement, made
within hours of President
Eisenhower’s State of the
Union message, directed some
anxious attention to the state
of th e~ U.S. defence-
programme. London
“Economist’s” Washington
correspondent described the
President’s review of the pro-
gramme as “naive, and, at
times, almost deceptive”:
“He told Congress about the
unexpected accuracy and relia-
bility of the Atlas intercon-
tinental missile as if this were
a cause for unrelieved joy. In
fact, the Americans have so
few Atlases at the moment that
it makes little difference how
accurate they are. The extra
missiles which, according to
reports, the Administration
now plans to build will not be
ready until 1961 or 1962. But
if Soviet missiles have
improved as much anc *
Russian guidance-systems have
generally been at least as good
as American —the number ot
missiles needed to knock-ou
the Americans’ present retalia-
tory power at a single blow
may have been cut from 30U
to about 150 ; and the Russians
will soon have that number.
“Moreover, Mr. Eisenhower
told his audience that ‘some
submarines armed with P°^
missiles will go on active duty
this year, although the experts

service ; and he talked of the
‘always ready’ divisions of the
Army’s strategic forces and of
the Marines as if no one knew
that only three out of the six
were really ready for battle.
No doubt the President’s
nonchalance about defence
springs from his belief that he
can come to an understanding
with Mr. Khrushchev. But
even those who applaud his
efforts in that direction might
still wish that he would prepare
a little more carefully in case
the attempt to negotiate fails.”
The “New York Times”
disagrees with this view and
supports President Eisen-
hower’s “considered military
opinion” that U.S. nuclear
strength, “made effective by
manned bombers, intercon-
tinental ballistic missiles and
now atomic submarines, is
great enough to deter any
aggressor from waging a
general nuclear war against us.
And our conventional arma-
ment, including carrier-forces,
troops abroad and always-
ready strategic forces, is
sufficient to cope with any
non - nuclear ‘brush fire’
conflict.
“The President will
undoubtedly be challenged on
both points. But any such
challenge must not ignore the
second factor of collective
security, embracing in effect
the armed forces of all free
nations. In the face of divisive
trends within this security
system the President again
pledged unwavering American
loyalty. And in the face of
expected opposition he pro-
posed to call for increased
American aid.
“On one point the Presi-
dent was less than convincing.
Despite spectacular Soviet
successes in space-exploration
based on powerful military
rockets, he insisted on con-
tinued separation of our space
programme from our military
programme.
“This separation may not,
as he maintained, interfere
with the development of our
military missiles. But it surely
means, at the least, duplica-
tion of effort to the benefit
of neither programme and it
has helped to rob us of
psychological triumphs which
the Soviets have reaped in such
full measure, to the detriment
of American prestige. It must
be hoped that the improve-
ments promised by the Presi-
dent will provide an adequate
remedy for this.”
Various Voices
President Eisenhower: “We
believe that only' in freedom
can men enjoy true and full
peace. We believe that free-
dom will ultimately be won
everywhere. The human
hunger for freedom is far too
deep-seated in human-nature
to be put off by a contrived
definition of a man-made
philosophy.”
M. Leopold Senghor,
Premier of the Mali Federa-
tion : “If I thought Africans
could not produce a democracy
I would leave politics. We are
not Communists. The African
is religious at heart. For us
Socialism and Marxism are
simply technical processes to
achieve higher standards of
living ; they are not a way of
life. That is why we will build
a different kind of Socialism
based on African values.”
Herr Willy Brandt, Mayor
of West Berlin : “Berlin is a
clean city, a city which has
not endured its bitter experi-
ences in vain, a city which will
not permit any louts to en-
danger its struggle for freedom
and self-determination. We
have taken the side of free-
dom, which for us' means both
anti-Communism and anti-
Nazism.”
Britain's Minister of De-
fence, Mr. Watkinson: “It
would be wrong for us [the
British Government] to seek to
shelter in our defence-policy
too much under the shadow of
the major nuclear deterrent.
This means that we must see
that we have well-balanced
forces, equipped with the best
and most modern weapons
that are available.”

Great white clam-shells set on
a base ornamented with pearly
nautilus or polished cowrie-
shells are used as christening-

years after the wreck. A
copper jug retrieved at the

ewer ; her brass riding-light
burns perpetually as a
sanctuary lamp, and a lifebuoy,

nautical relics are also on view,
as well as part of the steamer’s

altar by Australian artist Colin
Tress. It portrays a brilliant
horizon stretching from Boigu
Island, near the Dutch-British
Papuan border, to Murray
Island at the head of the Great
Barrier Reef. In the centre is
a figure of the robed Christ,,
and at the back a plain cross
shows amidst the clouds, while
on one side a pearling-lugger
drifts on a sea of black and on
the opposite side a kneeling
native bends in adoration.
Memories of other lost ships
are also preserved in this tropic

In this quiet setting on Yam Island (Torres Strait) an old
ship’s-bell is just discernible near the left side, where it
hangs from a coconut-palm for use as a church bell.

used as the first font when the
cathedral was opened, serves as

of ship’s benches in the nave
came from the ship Volga.
There are a lifebuoy and flag
from the s.s. Kanahooka,
which foundered in the Gulf

are shown relics from many
other vessels, both of naval
and merchant listing.
Outside the cathedral is a
tall wooden tower carrying two'
bells. One of these belonged
to the Quetta, and now rings
every morning and evening for
the daily services at which both
white and dark-skinned sea-
farers gather—representatives
of many races at this island
outpost. The church is not
yet completed, awaiting a
tower to finish-off its design.
During War II many thousands
of servicemen and others
passed through its doors.
One must not forget in these
Church links with the sea the
bells of numberless lost ships
that have been brought up from
the seabed or reefs on which
rest the remains of the craft
that carried them. Once they
sounded the hours of watch
aboard noble sailing-ship or
fleet-winged . clipper ; now,
beneath coconut-palms or
sheltered within the belfry of
some church, they call
worshippers to their religious
duties, while at the same time
their notes echo in requiem for
those who went down to the
sea in ships—and did not
return.


Forthrightness on New Guinea
By "FUZZY WUZZY"
One good effect of the recent
controversies over income-
tax in New Guinea and Papua
and the role of white settlers
in the Territory has been to
make the Administration more
outspoken in explaining or
defending its policies.
This development is wel-
come and significant. It is
associated, perhaps, with the
closer relations with the Dutch
across the frontier and the
world-wide attention being
directed, especially in Asia,
towards New Guinea as a result
of the continued Indonesian
claim to the western end.
Whatever the causes, the
announcements have been blunt
and to the point. For example,
Administrator Don Cleland
said in Lae on October 25 that
some of the publicity in Aus-
tralia concerning develop-
mental trends in the Territory
had not been based on sound
knowledge of the country and
its people.
The figures, he said, refuted
any suggestion or imputation
that land-ownership was pass-
ing from the native people. The
Territory had a total land-area
of 120-million acres, of which
approximately 117-million were
owned or occupied by Papuans
or New Guineans or were
uninhabited. The total land-
area owned and occupied by
the Administration and persons
other than natives was three-
million acres, or 2.5 per cent,
of the total area.
The policy, which he thought
needed more publicity in Aus-
tralia, was that no land could
he bought or acquired in any
way from natives except by
the Administration, which
then made suitable areas avail-
able to white settlers. Before
any land was bought from
native owners £>y the Adminis-
tration, “scrupulous care” was
taken to ensure that none was
alienated unless it was not
needed or would not be needed
hy the native owners.
“Those who unthinkingly
advocate a policy of no land-
alienation,” the Administrator
Sai d, “are actually urging a
policy of retarding develop-
ment of the Territory and its
native people.
“Every European plantation
0r farm is an unofficial demon-
stration-centre for the natives
°f the area, and native interest
in cash-cropping is best stimu-
lated by establishment of
European properties in the
area.”
Mr. Cleland said it had been
suggested that European
settlers were not getting a fair
deal. During the last five years
245 agricultural and pastoral
leases had been granted, with
a hotel °h 150,394 acres. There
hadbeen 566 land-grants since
1945 with a combined area of
nearly 300,000 acres,

obvious and sound Australian
interests behind the other
reason why we encourage
settlement in this Territory,
“if Australians are to settle
here, they can rightly expect
security and a fair return on
their investment and effort,
They are getting these basic
rights, and they will continue
to get them,
“That should teach you not to leave the bath running!”
“Not only is the way clear
for the Australian settler to
pioneer the Territory’s develop-
ment without wasteful inter-
ference. The policy of the
Australian Government and
Administration is to help him
get established.”
These were clear statements.
On the following day the
Administrator spoke at a
Missions-Administration con-
ference in Port Moresby on
some aspects of native life.
Here again his remarks were
pertinent.
A Papuan or New Guinean,
he said, who by the circum-
stances of his life and environ-
ment knew nothing of any
society more complex than
that bounded by a village or
group of villages, doubtless
believed it logical to assume
that, since civilisation as they
knew it provided certain ser-
vices for them free, then as
other needs and other wants
arose these services also would
be made available to them with-
out cost or any contribution on
their part.
“This, of course,” the
Administrator said, “brings
home the fact that we defeat
our own purpose if we do not
make it plain from the start
that we give them assistance
and essential basic services
solely to enable them to help
themselves, and that progress
does not come by passive
acceptance of help or by half-
hearted effort dwindling
quickly into inertia I
wonder if we explain to the
native people clearly enough,
and often enough, that the
economy of a country is the
same as the economy of a
village, only oil a much larger
scale. It is rich or poor,
depending on how much it
produces; and production
requires that people work.”
These were forceful and
reassuring statements. They
came just after the opening in
Moresby of the highly import-
ant Inter-Territory Malaria
Co-ordination Conference, at
which 12 overseas delegates
were present.
That conference, concerned
with the fact that one-third
of the world’s people live in
malarious areas, heard some-
thing of what is being done to
counter the disease in Aus-
tralia’s New Guinea territories.
The picture was grim
enough. The Administrator
said that the disease was health
problem number-one. In the
Territory of Papua and New
Guinea it was responsible for
15 per cent, of all admissions
to hospitals and for 12.6 per
cent, of all deaths in hospital.
“In Maprik, one of our most
highly endemic areas, 60 per
cent, of all infants born alive
die before reaching the age
of 18 months. Malaria is the
main contributing factor in
this high mortality.
“A malaria-control pilot-
project based on the principle
of control through residual
spraying is now in progress at
Maprik. In certain parts of
the Western Highlands,
seasonal malaria epidemics
have infected up to three-
quarters of the population,
and up to two per cent, of the
population has died.”
Mr. Cleland said the anti-
malaria programme now
inaugurated would last up to
14 years and cost about
£2,300,00(1. The aim was to
eradicate malaria entirely from
the Territory.
These statements will prob-
ably prove the forerunners of
others. They deserve wide
attention in Australia.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Some Railways Profits
That Australians can run
railways at a profit if poli-
ticians give them the chance is
shown by the latest results of
the three lines controlled by
the Commonwealth Commis-
sioner for Railways—the East-
West (Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie),
the Central Australian (Port
Augusta to Alice Springs) and
the North Australian (Darwin
to Larrimah).
Mileages open as at 30/6/’59
were Port Pirie-Kalgoorlie,
1108; Port Augusta to
Hawker, 65 ; Stirling North to
Alice Springs, 757; and
Darwin-Larrimah, 316. The
first-mentioned is standard
gauge, as are 217 miles of the
Central Australian line; the
other two are 3ft. 6in.
The commissioner’s report
for the year ended 30/6/ 59 is
a notable document in three
respects: the speed with which
it was compiled and dis-
patched ; its letterpress, charts,
illustrations and map ; and the
results shown.
After the Treasury had made
sundry adjustments, including
interest, exchange, National
Debt Sinking Fund, super-
annuation, etc., the year’s net
profit was £433,008. To any-
one familiar with the results
of the State systems this might
seem unbelievable ; but there
it is.
The commissioner points
out that there have been no
increases in fares or freights
since September, 1951, though
there have been substantial
rises in wages and costs of
materials. In that time an
enginedriver’s weekly wage
jumped from £l3 14s. to
£2O Bs.; other wage-increases
varied from 49 per cent, to
53 per cent.; and the cost of
track-sleepers doubled.
The system absorbed all rises
by greater efficiency and sub-
stantially increased traffic.
Competition with road-hauliers
is unrestricted, but the com-
missioner has beaten this on
the Trans-Australian line by
the “pick-a-back” haulage of
loaded semi-trailers. He has
also gone flat out to obtain
freight, maintaining a special
staff for the purpose.
Due to more freight carried
and substantial economies,
operating-costs per goods ton-
mile show a slow but steady
decline on both the Trans-
Australian and Central Aus-
tralian lines, and for the first
“ Daddy, DADDY! They're going to be HIGHBROWS!”
time in history the Darwin-
Larrimah line of 316 miles
showed a working-profit.
The commissioner has not
had an easy job. The Trans-
Australian line gives compara-
tively little maintenance
trouble; but the monsoonal
deluges in summer cause many
problems on the N.A. line ;
the Alice Springs line suffers
from frequent sand-drift ; and
when it does get a flood, much
damage is done on the numer-
ous Finke River crossings.
Labor turnover is the com-
missioner’s biggest bugbear.
His track-maintenance staff was
always below strength—6s per
cent, of employees leaving
within two months of appoint-
ment. Despite this, he reports
that the track was satisfactorily
maintained.
Altogether, Mr. Hanna-
berry’s report shows what can
be done when the commis-
sioner is unhampered by politi-
cal control. —D. C. Tilghman
(N.S.W.).
Incentive Payments
In the past five years the
Lincoln Electric Company has
paid £270,000 in incentive pay-
ments to its employees, the
1959 amount being £47,000.
The interesting and - vital
point about this is that the pay-
ments haven’t come out of
anybody’s pocket. The share-
holders haven’t paid them
their dividends may actually
have increased as a result of
them. The company’s custo-
mers haven’t paid them —in
fact they’ve also profited from
them, because, although overall
costs have risen by an average
of 200 per cent, since the war,
the company has been able to
reduce the prices of some of
its commodities and has got by
with moderate advances on
others. The company attributes
this to its incentive payments.
The country hasn’t paid, either
—it has gained, too, in the way
of increased sales-, income- and
other taxes.
I’ve heard most of the argu-
ments unions employ against
incentive payments they
penalise the worker who can’t
keep up with the field ; they
put or keep another man out
of work; they introduce an
unwelcome competitive spirit
which sets workers at each
other’s throats ; they create
disharmony and disunity ; they
strike at the basis of unionism.
But I’ve yet to see one argu-
ment that looked well when
placed alongside an extra
quarter-of-a-million in the
workers’ pockets, plus lower
costs for the consumer (who
is also a wage-earner). And if
you throw into the balance
increased prospects of compet-
ing with foreign manufacturers
the arguments look really
sick.
In any case they won’t stand
analysis. The term “too old
at 40" was coined before the
advent of most of the modern
labor-saving devices, health-
inducing medicines and
methods of working. Increas-
ing production doesn’t put
other men out of work until
industry reaches saturation-
point, and that isn't likely to
occur. Competition is seldom
unwelcome and usually in-
vigorating, and it’s more likely
to unite workers than create
disharmony —they find them-
selves working for a common
as well as an individual gain.
And nothing strikes at the
basis of unionism like a dic-
tatorship which seeks, among
other things, to bind an
ambitious and capable worker
to the output of his less-
efficient mates.
Wage-rises, whether mar-
ginal or basic-wage increases,
inevitably produce correspond-
ing price-rises on goods, be-
cause they’re an extra cost
without extra output. A more
commonsense approach is
through incentive payments.
This needn’t be as complicated
as it sounds. There's hardly a
man in any factory or office
who couldn’t work a little
harder or a bit more efficiently,
and probably be all the better
for it.
instead of wearing - out
quicker, men last longer when
work ng under The spur of a
profitable incentive. A busy
man who expects to reap the
rewards of his labor is far
happier than a wage-plug
grudgingly conceding his 40
hours for a set wage ; and he
may produce twice as much for
little more effort.
If Australia is to compete
with foreign manufacturers
and producers, as she must to
live, we’ve got to produce more
at less cost. Incentive pay-
ments, along the lines of th e

Bureaucratic Takeover
An example of the wrecking
of a successful private business
by the dictatorial resumption of
iand by a Government depart-
ment has lately come to light in
Goulburn (N.S.W.).
The McAlisters, two brothers
in their fifties, have all their
life been running a dairy on a
90-acre property on the out-
skirts of Goulburn, and they
know no other job. The dairy
had been in production for over
50 years when the brothers were
practically forced into closing
it down on December 31, 1959.
Some 12 years ago the De-
partment of Education resumed
30 acres of the farm for a pro-
posed technical-college. All the
farm’s buildings were on those
30 acres, and, as the Goulburn
City Council had condemned
the buildings under the Health
Act, the brothers considered it
would not be worth spending
the £5OO necessary to renovate
them. The brothers say that,
if the department decided to
resume, their money would
have gone down the drain. They
would not have been recom-
pensed.
The brothers were producing
80 gallons of milk a day be-
fore they closed-down. One
brother had had only one holi-
day in the past 20 years, and
the other claims he has not had
a whole day off in that time.
When the department
resumed it offered the brothers
£3400 for the 30 acres. The
brothers reckon they could get
£BOOO for that area now. At
time of writing no payment has
been made.
This is probably no isolated
case ; and even if, perhaps, no
real hardship, has been inflicted
on the brothers (though both
have to look around for another
job rather late in life), there
should surely be some way in
which a successful and publicly
useful business is not thus
forced to close-down by the
impersonal decree of a Govern-
ment department. Zorok
(N.S.W.).
Police Uniforms
At last the N.S.W. Govern-
ment is talking of doing some-
thing about the intolerably hot
uniforms which policemen have
been compelled to wear in
summer for as long as I can
remember. But even now it is
a half-hearted attempt; and it
will not surprise if the Force
has to go on sweating in its
serge for another summer or
two.
I can recall an attempt being
made at least 20 years ago to
induce the Government to
provide cooler and lighter uni-
forms for police, but the re-
quest was fobbed-off on some
pretext or other. Now the
Premier has promised to intro-
duce, on trial for the balance
of this summer, a uniform that
should keep the wearers’
temperatures down to normal
on hot, sticky days.
Presumably a few selected
men are to wear the proposed
new uniform for a period and
then report on its suitability.
The Premier has promised that
if the report is favorable the
new uniform will be issued to
all members of the Force for
the 1960-61 summer.
If the trial-uniform is
already in production the
scheme may work out, because
there are still some weeks of
summer left; but the slightest
hitch will almost certainly
cause the “trial” to be deferred
for another year and the
general issue, if there is to be
one, for a year after that,
Doesn’t the Government
know that policemen in
Queensland have been wearing
a lightweight uniform for
years? If so, why hasn’t that
uniform been used as a model
for N.S.W. police? Mem-
bers of the R.A.A.F. all over
Australia also wear a light
summer-uniform, and they look
cool and comfortable in it on
hot days compared with our
heavily-clothed policemen,
Members of the Force are


constantly being told they
must be calm and courteous
when dealing with members of
the public, but it beats me how
any policeman, clothed as he
is now, could feel that way on
a sweltering day when wrest-
ling with a drunk, booking a
motorist or even directing
traffic in the sticky atmosphere
of a Sydney intersection. —

Geography, Not Snobbery
Tell Olaf Ruhen (B.
20/l/’6O) that snobbery by
Victorians and South Aus-
tralians because their colonies
had never been convict settle-
ments —if it had any influence
at all —was only a minor fac-
tor in preventing the Aus-
tralian colonies from federat-
ing shortly after attaining
responsible government.
Far more important was the
geographical setting of the
colonies. They are all expanded
from seaboards ; most of their
early trade was with the
Motherland; they were pro-
tected by the all-powerful
British Navy from any pos-
sible aggressor. There was thus
no practical reason why they
should seek to federate.
It was not until their hinter-
lands had been settled and
there was rail-communication
between the eastern capitals
"... and, don't forget, some of them are giving away
free gifts!”
that there was any extensive
internal social or commercial
intercourse. The period when
this happened—from the 1870’s
to the 1890’s —also saw the
spectacular rise of Japan to
the position of an important
Power ; the acquisition by the
new aggressive German Em-
pire of part of New Guinea ;
and the possibility that China,
“the sleeping giant,” might
emulate Japan. All this made
the advantages of Federation
far more manifest than before.
The former British colonies
in North America that formed
the U.S. were in an entirely
different situation. They were
all on the Atlantic seaboard.
Beyond was a vast wilderness.
Outposts of two great empires
—the British and Spanish—
bounded them on the north,
the south and the south-west.
If the States had separated
after the War of Independence
they would have quarrelled
over division of the frontier
lands, and would have been in
peril of falling easy prey to
one or both of the neighboring
imperial Powers.
These possibilities were
obvious enough to overcome
the strong feelings of jealousy
that had characterised the
relationship of the old colonies
with each other, and win a
majority for Federation. —

Ownership of News
“Galyute’s” thoughts on pay-
ments to civil servants for
news-items prepared in the
course of their ordinary duty
(B. 20/1/’6O) reminded me of
a controversy which raged be-
tween city and country daily
newspapers about 25 years ago
over the ownership of news.
City papers then, as now,
got the bulk of their country
news from reporters on local
papers. These reporters were
encouraged by their bosses to
undertake such assignments,
the extra money helping to
keep them happy in their then
comparatively poorly paid jobs.
But some reporters at times
showed more energy and en-
thusiasm for city assignments
than for their own jobs, and
finally their bosses cracked
down on them, decreeing that
the city papers must wait until
the news had been printed
locally.
This didn’t suit the city
editors, who like country news
only when it is boiling hot.
They engaged outsiders to act
for them, with the inevitable
result that many incomplete
and inaccurate accounts of
country happenings got printed.
Finally the city proprietors
hit on a shrewd plan for bring-
ing the country proprietors to
heel. They inserted in the cable
agreement, when it came up for
renewal in the early ’thirties,
a condition that no staff-
member of a subscribing news-
paper must be hindered from
supplying news to a city paper
as soon as possible after it
broke.
The country boys kicked like
bell before signing on the
dotted line, arguing that any
news collected by members of
their staff belonged to the pro-
prietors, who should be paid
accordingly when the city press
used that news. The city boys
turned a deaf ear to this ; and
the country proprietors had to
fall into line.
A somewhat similar dispute
s Prang up between the A.B.C.
and country-newspaper pro-
prietors when the commission
began organising its inde-
pendent service early in 1947.

ment for first use of every

We re happy to undertake the

bosses rebelled.
When word of the proposed

Sideline Production
In presenting his case against
the “backyard grower” (B.
13/1/ ’6O), “Papaw” opens-up
a pretty big subject.
It’s quite true that these
people, if numerous enough,
can upset marketing-systems ;
it is also true that in cases
where strict hygiene is neces-
sary they often evade rules im-
posed on regular growers and
may cause a hazard to public
health. But where- is “Pa-
paw” going to draw the line?
And, in any case, is he justified
in drawing one?
Take my case. I am a dairy-
farmer. Quite a bit of my in-
come is from sale of cattle
and pigs, and that is presumably
a legitimate part of dairying,
as I must use-up my skim-milk.
But I also grow a variety of
crops for greenfeed; grain,
pumpkins, etc., for cattle- and
pig-feed, and fruit, vegetables
and eggs for our own use.
As “Papaw” knows, nobody
can grow exactly enough to
meet his needs ; seasonal and
other vagaries must be reckoned
with. The only safe way is to
plan for a surplus. Sometimes
it turns up, and then what am
I to do with it? I’m not a
recognised producer of eggs or
vegetables ; but why shouldn’t
I give them away or, if they
are in sufficient quantity to
make it worth while, sell them?
Taking a wider view, the
world’s good land is strictly
limited, while there is no limit
in sight to the human race.
Two-thirds of the world’s popu-
lation have never had three
good meals in the one day.
Unrra estimates that it needs a
minimum of £5 a year for each
refugee in its care. Think of
it! A person living on two-
bob a week —less than it cost
20 years ago to feed a soldier
for a day. And there are
millions of such refugees.
It is not only folly but down-
right wickedness to waste a
handful of food or to leave a
square-yard of good land lying
idle. In 50 years or less we
may even find that it was also
national suicide. Magnoon

FOR PONY CLUBS
IpiFTY years ago motor-cars
were as rare as golden
sovereigns are today. For
long journeys you took the
train, unless you decided it
was simpler to stay home.
Shorter trips—unless you pre-
ferred Shanks’s mare—meant
going on horseback or in some
conveyance drawn by horses.
According to the
Canadian Bureau of
Statistics, Canadian
shorn wool production
in 1959 amounted to
6.8 million lb. greasy
basis. This was 7 per
cent, more than the
1958 figure of
6,345,0001 b. There were
898,000 head shorn as
compared with 862,000
head in 1958, and the
average fleece weight
rose from 7.41 b. to
7.61 b. in 1959.
Growers the world
over are continuously
striving for higher pro-
duction, and in Aus-
tralia they are con-
siderably helped by the
use of Elastrator
Rubber Rings. These
reduce the lamb mor-
tality rate since every
lamb saved means
increased production.
The Elastrator method
provides effective,
humane castration and
tailing without loss of
blood or open wounds.
At that time life moved by
horsepower, though the term
had not yet acquired the mean-
ing we recognise today. Per-
haps men were happier then.
I’ve heard it argued convinc-
ingly that the decline of civili-
sation started with the inven-
tion of the internal-combustion
engine. That may be true,
whatever the material benefits
of the machine evidently are.
Certainly people were
healthier. In the Army we
used to say that as long as
staff-officers had to get around
on horseback they arrived to
visit honest soldiers with their
livers shaken-up and in the
best of humor. Once motor-
cars were put on the war-
establishment the whole thing
changed. I don’t believe that
stomach-ulcers or coronary
occlusions had been invented
before the Tin Lizzie first
popularised motoring.
There’s another more im-
portant side to equitation,
though. It calls for skill, and
that breeds self-confidence and
courage, which are two of the
cornerstones of character both
for men and nations. It teaches
consideration for the horse,
which is a living creature and
different from a man-made
machine, and for fellow-men.
It wasn’t for nothing that
chivalry took its name from
horses.
Perhaps it’s this last property
of character-building which,
the more we become motorised,
has made horsemanship, by
paradox, more popular than
ever among the younger genera-
tion. This has led to the forma-
tion of pony-clubs throughout
Australia to maintain and
promote a recognised standard
of instruction and horseman-
ship among junior riders.
In 1952 the N.S.W. branch
of the Equestrian Federation of
Australia agreed to administer
pony-clubs in the State for
three years, until they could
form their own governing body.
In 1955 the Pony Club Associ-
ation of N.S.W. was formed,
and there are now 145 pony-
clubs in N.S.W., representing
about 9000 young riders, while
the movement is growing
rapidly in all States of the
Commonwealth.
Three years ago the first
edition of Riding; the Pony
Club Manual of Instruction
and Training was published by
the Equestrian Federation of
Australia (N.S.W. Branch) and
the Pony Club Association of
N.S.W. It was an immediate
success. A new edition has just
come-out. (It’s available from
all booksellers at 12s. 6d.)
This second edition contains
148 pages and a large number
of photographs and drawings.
It aims to produce uniformity
in instruction and judging, so
that inter-club and inter-State
members may be tested and
judged on the same lines.
Therefore, besides ordinary
details of instruction, it in-
cludes particulars of standards
required to gain the four cer-
tificates and pass the Pony
Club Dressage Test Z.
There's an excellent chapter on
the organisation of a pony-
club camp, which gives all
possible information, includ-
ing an estimate of provisions
needed for different numbers
of members, details of catering,
administration, hygiene and
discipline.
The chapter on troop-drill is
good and correct. It's easily
understood by anyone who
knows the drill-book by heart,
but present reviewer suspects
that for instructors coming new
to the game —and the supply
of old horse-soldiers won’t last
for ever—it might be easier to
grasp if more simply and logi-
cally laid-out. Starting with
a few general notes covering
scope, definitions and method
of instruction (these are all
there, though not consecutive)
across the full width of the
page at the top, it might then
be possible to tabulate the
movements into three columns
(1) word-of-command, (2)
action and (3) remarks; for
example, thus:
(1) ‘'Centre guide, prove.”
(2) Centre rider extends the
right arm straight to the front.
Rest of troop look inwards to-
wards centre guide for dressing.
(3) Centre guide must ride
straight, or he’ll cause jamming
and gaps in the ranks.
It's merely a matter of
layout, but sometimes that
makes quite a bit of difference.
In conclusion, here is an
extract from Chapter 3 :
Good riding is an affair of skill,
but bad riding is an affair ot
courage. Good riding will last
through age, sickness, and decrepl
tude, but bad riding will last only
as long as youth, health and strength
supply courage.
There’s sense in that, and
it's good to know the kids are
being told such simple truth.

situation becomes clearer, no
introductions from any State

Rhinitis causes inflam-
mation of the mucous mem-
branes of the pig’s nose, and
is characterised by sneezing
and discharge from the nose
and eyes. Affected animals
become very ill, and those that
do not die take a long time to
recover.
Meanwhile, Australian
authorities in Great Britain
have.stopped all imports of pigs
to the Commonwealth from
both Northern Ireland and
Eire, because they suspect that
Landrace pigs imported from
Northern Ireland may be the
source of the outbreak in S.A.
It’s thought that, because of
the high price Landrace pigs
are realising in Australia, some
animals have been smuggled in,
without passing through
quarantine.
Better Crops
“Wimra”: Wimmera
farmers Ray and Wesley
Francis last year won the
Horsham (Vic.) wheat-com-
petition and the Southern
Wimmera championship at
their first attempt, on land
which, under the old wheat-
fallow rotation, had been pro-
ducing less than 10 bags an
acre.
Wheat-pasture-fallow rota-
tion adopted 12 years ago lifted
production to a 20-bag average
in good seasons, with 22 bags
an acre on the championship-
winning 50 acres.
Claiming that early and well-
worked fallow is an important
factor in high wheat-produc-
tion—and all the more neces-
sary, in the three-year rota-
tion—they start their fallow
with a mouldboard-plough in
May or June and work it well
after every rain. They risk
some soil-drift by having it
worked fine before Christmas ;
but it pays to have weeds, wild
°ats, stingless-nettle, wild-
cabbage, sharlock and iron-
weed, which can smother the
young crop, all ripped-out be-
fore sowing wheat at 801 b.
or 901 b. an acre, with an equal
quantity of super.
This extra working certainly
Pays: they now get more wheat
from two-thirds their former
acreage and run more sheep.
Last year an 80-acre paddock
cut 6000 bales of hay, and
eve n in the present dry season
they will get comparatively
high returns.
On the other hand, nearby
farmers Frank and Harold
Sudholz, practising the same
three-year rotation, work their
land less than formerly, but
burn-off all surplus trash
before breaking-up pasture for
wheat, and thereby lift the
“How long do you simmer ?”
yield by at least three bags an
acre. They estimate that 70
per cent, of stubble and vege-
tation is powdered and pugged
into the soil by the sheep during
the year under pasture. The
nitrogen which would be neces-
sary (if the other 30 per cent,
was not burned) to convert the
30 per cent, into humus is
thus available for wheat-growth
and quality.
A few years ago their wheat
was placed last in a large class
at Horsham’ (Vic.) Show ; last
year it won first prize for
quality against 30 other entries
at Horsham and also won in
the novice section for quality
at Melbourne Royal Show.
A further, gain from their
barrel-clover and Clare-clover
pasture is that it has practically
eliminated the eelworm which
once infested their land. In-
deed the clover thrives best
where eelworms used to be
worst.
Still another district farmer,
E. J. Tucker, favors a four-
year rotation, which, he says,
means less working, wheat and
fallows freer of weeds, higher
yields from less acreage, and
higher soil-fertility because of
the extra year under pasture.
Applications of zinc at long
intervals —the last was in 1948
—also increase soil-fertility.
Barrel-clover, which does not
strike well in the cold, wet
sowing-period for wheat, is
now being sown in March,
ready for the first autumn
rains.
Tucker, living on the Wim-
mera River, has 50 acres of
pasture, perennial rye-grass,
strawberry-clover and white-
clover and some lucerne, which,
top-dressed heavily and irri-
gated eight or nine times yearly,
enabled him to increase his
Dorset Horn stud to 400 ewes
and maintain a stud of 30
polled Herefords. As supple-
mentary fodder, he bales hay
from 15 acres of irrigated
lucerne and as much barrel-
clover as the season permits.
There will be none this year,
but last year he cut 6000 bales.
Stem-rust
“Wandoan”: During the
1959 season a new strain of
stem-rust attacked varieties of
wheat on Queensland’s Darling
Downs which had hitherto
been resistant to the disease.
Gabo and Charter, the two
most popular varieties, were
severely hit, and their loss of
resistance has been a serious
blow to the wheatgrowing
industry in that district.
The only three varieties
which retained a satisfactory
degree of field-resistance were
Spica and Lawrence (both
Queensland-bred) and Festival
(bred in N.S.W.). With two
new Queensland introductions
—Hopps and Kenora, both
rust-resistant —Darling Downs
growers are lucky in being
able to choose from five first-
class varieties for the 1960
sowing. Another new variety,
Gala, has also shown great
resistance to stem-rust, but it
will not be released until 1961.
In the Lower Dawson, n.-w.
of the Downs, excellent crops
were harvested, with yields up
to 40 bushels an acre. Gabo,
the principal variety grown,
suffered attack from rust, but
was not seriously affected be-
cause of the drier conditions
prevailing.
Spica has proved to be one
of the best grain-varieties, and,
being resistant to both drought
and rust, is widely grown. The
green stems are not very palat-
able, and kangaroos which
gorge on Gabo and Festival

The 1960
Royal Easter Show
Although the 1960 Royal
Easter Show is more than
nine weeks away, Sydney Show-
ground is already a hive of
industry, primary and
secondary.
Teams of workmen there
are flat-out on one of the
biggest reconstruction pro-
grammes the R.A.S. of N.S.W.
has ever undertaken. The
R.A.S. promises that the
Showground will have a
“brand-new look” by the time
the Show opens on Friday,
April 8. More than £lOO,OOO is
being spent on improvements
to the Showground.
One of the most important
improvements is the creation
of a new horse-assembly area
and marshalling-yard. This
has involved the demolition of
several buildings and the
removal of some sideshows to
a new area,
Allied with the ;aew
marshalling-yard is a steel-
and-concrete overhead road-
way —400 ft. long, 20ft.
wide, with a clearance of
15ft. 6in. at its highest point—
now nearing completion. In
the past horses have had to
cross the crowded main Show-
ground streets to enter the
arena from under the Martin
and Angus Stand. Now, they
will proceed over the heads
of the people and enter the
arena on the western side of
that stand.
Other Showground improve-
ments are:
9 Extension of the lower
deck of the grandstand to pro-
vide seats for 1000 more people.
• Alteration and modernisa-
tion of the Showground liquor-
bars.
9 Re-roofing of the Royal
Hall of Industries and the
Hordern Pavilion.
In addition to this R.A.S
building-programme, several
banks and private firms are
erecting new modern buildings
on the Showground for the
1960 Show.
The R.A.S. says the Show
this year will be bigger and
brighter than ever. Spectacular
industrial displays will vie with
parades of livestock and agri-
cultural exhibits. The R.A.S
is confident that attendances
will again exceed a million
people during the 10 days and
eight nights the Show is open.
Show attendances have ex-
ceeded a million on every oc-
casion since War 11.
Prizemoney for this year s
Show totals more than £38,800,
the highest in the society’s
history. *
Entries in the sections which
have already closed indicate
that total entries will be very
high. They have been so high
in recent years that the R.A.S.
has been compelled to restrict
the showing of livestock to
those of established quality.
R.A.S. president Sam Hordern,
says: “We do not regard this as
a retrograde step. The know-
ledge that only the best is dis-
played at the Sydney Royal
cannot fail to have beneficial
results.”
The impression that the horse
is dying-out in Australia is not
supported by horse-entries for
this year’s Show. Entries for
riding-competitions alone are
a record 2173, or 320 more than
last year. The amazing growth
of the pony-club movement in
N.S.W. is reflected in a flood
of pony-team entries, and the
R.A.S. will find difficulty in
accommodating all the horses
and ponies at the Show-
ground.
The value of purebred live-
stock at the Show this year is
likely to be about million ;
industrial displays, worth a
further £4 million, will repre-
sent more than 500 exhibitors.
A big new feature of the
Show will be a woodchopping
championship between teams
of six Australian and six New
Zealand axemen. This will be
the first time an official New
Zealand team of axemen has
competed at the Royal Easter
Show. The contest will be held
in the main arena at the Show-
ground. The winners will
receive a silver cup and £5OO
presented by Sir Edward Hall-
strom.
The main ring will be the
scene of exciting hunting and
jumpng events,. trotting-races,
night polo, dancing displays by-
Sydney school-children and
the ever-popular rodeo. The
rodeo events carry prizemoney
of about £2400 and include the
Australasian Buckjumping
Championship.
Four noted overseas judges
have accepted invitations to
officiate at the Show. T. F,
Bradstock, of England, will
judge Herefords; Robert
Drummond, of Scotland, wil]
judge Ayrshires ; T. A. Burge-
son, of U.S.A., will judge
Friesians; D. T. Sinclair, of
New Zealand, will judge dogs,
An outstanding exhibition of
competitive oil-paintings will be
staged on the upper floor of the
Arts and Crafts Pavilion. The
R.A.S. art-competition is being
held in three sections this year,
with entries closing on March
16. The Sir Charles Lloyd
Jones Memorial Art Prize for
an industrial subject has a
prize of £5OO. The Rural Bank
Art Prize for a rural subject
(traditional style) has a first
prize of £5OO, 'second prize of
£l5O and third prize of £5O,
The Caltex Oil Art Prize for
a rural subject (modern style)
has a prize of £5OO.
An innovation at this year’s
Show will be the opening of
the Horticulture Pavilion at
night. The hall, which
will contain floral and fish
(aquarium) exhibits, will be
open each day until 10 p.m.,
except Monday, April 11, and
Good Friday, April 15. The
night-opening is expected to
take crowds of people to the
Showground after they finish
work. Special new lighting for
the lawns and dahlia-terraces
near the Horticulture Pavilion
will also be a feature.
An R.A.S. spokesman said
this week: “Proof of the
Show’s strong appeal to the
general public was shown by the
fact that we maintained our
attendances at last year's Show,
whereas other forms of public
entertainment suffered a heavy
falling-off in popularity.”
Just to be on the safe side,
though, rain-insurance for the
1960 Show will total £lOO,OOO.
Fungus Diseases
“Zorok”: G. G. Hirst, act-
ing superintendent of the
A.C.T. Agriculture and Stock
Section, states that brown-rot
has lately been attacking plums
and apricots in A.C.T. orchards.
Peaches and nectarines have
also been affected.
The hot, humid weather
recently prevailing in and
around Canberra are conditions
in which brown-rot thrives. Hot
days with thunderstorms often
prove disastrous to ripening
fruit, and also to fruit already
harvested.
Hirst said that methods of
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(21/1/’60)
Heavy rains are likely in northern Queensland during
February, with flooding in the coastal districts from Mackay
northwards. Rainfall should be moderate in the southern
half of the State and light in part of the Maranoa and in the
far-western and far-south-western districts.
N.S.W. should have light to moderate rains during Feb-
ruary, with heavier falls in part of the central-western
districts and on the south-western Slopes. Rainfall looks like
being patchy during March, although heavy rains and
flooding may occur on the North Coast.
Victoria should receive moderate to good rains during
February, varying from light to moderate in the Mallee and
Wimmera. A period of patchy rainfall should follow, with
good seasonal rains in May.
Light to moderate patchy rains are indicated in South
Australia during February, although heavy storm-rains are
likely in the central districts. Good rains should be received
in May.
Good rains are indicated in most of Western Australia
during February, although the Gascoyne and Eucla districts
may have only light rain. Reasonably good rains should
continue in March.

Orchardists in the Goulburn
(N.S.W.) district, 60 miles to
the north, also report a cer-
tain amount of brown-rot in
the area, though lack Charles,
who should know, said he did
not think the disease was
serious in the district. Most of
his stone-fruits, he said, were
wonderfully clean. Neverthe-
less, he said that control-
measures were necessary and
recommended spraying with
sulphur preparations, such as
Flytox or Cosan.
Both Hirst and Charles also
mentioned that black-spot was
attacking apples and pears. For
this disease, their advice is:
“Either spray with a sulphur
preparation or use the T.M.T.D.
powders.”
Lucerne Outstanding
Pastures of green-panic,
Rhodes-grass and buffel-grass,
all in combination with lucerne,
have shown their usefulness in
Queensland’s medium-rainfall
dairying districts. .. Around
Kingaroy, Monto, Biloela and
Rockhampton and on the Darl-
ing Dowms these mixtures have
shown they can carry at least
twice as many stock as native
pastures can support.
Lucerne is still the most
versatile pasture-legume in
Queensland, and its climatic
range is greater than that of
some tropical legumes which
have done well in coastal dis-
tricts.
On a black-clay loam at
Monto green-panic and lucerne
and also Gayndah-buffel and
lucerne have done well for two
years. Elsewhere in the district
lucerne has been oversown into
a long-established Rhodes-
grass paddock and is competing
successfully with the grass. The
same thing is reported at Etna
Creek and Kalapa, near Rock-
hampton.
At Baking Board, near Chin-
chilla, on a red-brown sandy
loam, seven years’ persistence
of green-panic and lucerne and
Rhodes-grass and lucerne is
outstanding. A contour-row
pasture of two rows of green-
Panic alternating with one row
of lucerne is performing well.
With rows 42in. apart, the pas-
ture is producing from 60 per
cent, to 100 per cent, more
food than similar pastures with
row-spacings of 7in. to Min.
Combinations of Rhodes-
grass, lucerne, green-panic and
barrel-medic in the Millmerran
district are carrying one cow
to three or four acres. In good
seasons these pastures carry a
cow to two acres.
Irrigated pasture-trials at
Kilkivan, Miva (near Gympie)
and Byee (near Kingaroy) have
shown that these districts are
suitable for pasture-irrigation.
At Cooran the forage-yield was
doubled during summer by
applying 2cwt. sulphate-of-
ammonia at a cost of £4 an
acre. The yield was almost 11
tons of green-material an acre.
In a season with ample mois-
ture the cost of producing
additional grass-forage is less
than 13s. a ton.
A detailed grazing-trial at
the Rocklea Animal Husbandry
Research Farm showed that
rotational grazing gave a
pasture-yield of 15.9 tons of
green-material an acre, and
constant grazing 13.6 tons of
green-material an • acre. In a
two-year trial rotational graz-
ing gave an increase of 251 b.
an acre in liveweight-gain over
constant grazing.
Green Vegetable-bug
“Myall”: The green vege-
table-bug (Nezara viridula )
attacks and damages a number
of plants.
The adult bug, |in. long and
|in. broad, is bright green in
summer but brownish-grey
during the cooler months of
the year. It lays small,
cylindrical, cup-shaped eggs in
batches of 20 to 150 on the
underside of leaves of the host-
plant.
These eggs are pale-yellow
at first, but become pinkish
before hatching. In four or
five days tiny, wingless, orange-
brown bugs emerge, remaining
close to the eggshells for a
time before gradually dispers-
ing over the plant. After
moulting several times the bugs
reach the adult stage, produc-
ing several generations during
the year and wintering on the
host-plant.
The bug attacks beans and
causes stunting and weakening
of plants and malformation of
pods.. It invades citrus-trees
and causes the fruit to yellow
prematurely and drop-off. With
cucubits, it infests the main
stem and fruits, piercing the
plant-tissues and sucking the
juices.
Pawpaw-trees are sometimes
invaded, and young growth and
top of the tree form into a
dense mass, with short, dis-
torted stems, while lesions
appear where the fruit has been
pierced. Passion-vines will
shed hundreds of flowers and
young fruit through being de-
prived of normal sap-flow by
the bug’s activities. When
peanut plants are infested,
though, injury caused by the
pest brings on collapse of the
terminals which stimulates the
development of axillary buds,
so that damage is not serious.
Potato-crops, also, being well-
developed by the time the bugs
are numerous, are not seriously
affected.
The main damage caused to
tomatoes is sucking of juices
from the fruit, which become
mottled and blemished by
light-colored spots at each
puncture. The fruit does not
ripen evenly and becomes un-
palatable and unmarketable.
D.D.T. in the form of a 0.1
per cent, spray or 2 per cent,
dust effectively controls the
pest; applications should be
made when the insects are
numerous.
Fortunately, a parasite often
lays eggs inside those of the
bug and, on hatching, feeds on
the pest. Eggs that have been
attacked by parasites change
color to grey and should not
be destroyed.
When picking beans both
bugs and eggs can usually
be noticed and should be
destroyed.

Information Supplied
From “Holster”: Information on
“The Wild Scotchman” (B.
13 /1 / ’60)? Well, I think his
name was “Macgregor,” not
“McPherson.” He was the most
notorious bushranger in Queens-
land. Hailing from N.S.W., he was ,
at first a lone wolf. Not much
gold had been discovered at that
time, and his raids were mostly
on stations and travellers. He was
captured once, but managed to get
away while being taken to Rock-
hampton jail. At last, after an 80-
mile chase, two magistrates caught
him. The magistrates were getting
fresh horses at various points along
the way ; Macgregor was obliged
to stick to one. Anyway, he was
taken to Brisbane, where he got
20 years’ hard-labor in 1863.
Here is a list of the highest
rewards offered for the apprehension
of bushrangers. For the capture
of Francis Christie, alias Frank
Gardiner, £500; Daniel Morgan,
£1000; John Gilbert, Benjamin Hall
and John Dunn, £lOOO each; Burke,
O’Mealley and Frederick Ward,
£5OO each; Thomas Clarke, £1100;
John Clarke, £500; Patrick Connell,
£250; the murderers of the special
party of detectives, £5000; Edward
Kelly, Daniel Kelly, Stephen Hart
and Joseph Byrne (by N.S.W. and
Vic.), £BOOO.
Information Sought
(1) Details of the Commonwealth
Literary Fund ? (2) By whom is
it administered ?
(1) In 1908 the Federal Parlia-
ment voted £525 as a fund to make
grants to destitute authors, or
destitute widows and orphans of
authors. At the outset 14 of these
“literary pensions” were granted;
the fund was gradually increased.
In 1938 the scope of the fund was
extended to include grants of up
to £6OO to a number of authors
each year (usually three) so they
could work on specified projects.
In 1956 the value of fellowships
was increased to £lOOO a year. The
Commonwealth Literary Fund also
makes grants to the six State uni-
versities (as well as to the Uni-
versity of New England and
Canberra University College) to
enable an annual series of five
lectures on Australian literature to
be delivered.
(2) The fund is administered by
a committee of Federal Parliament.
The Prime Minister is chairman.
An advisory board, consisting of
“Now you're getting somewhere, Fred—
the horn blows!”
five scholars and writers, advises the
committee on literary questions.
The board meets four or five times
a year, and there is a combined
meeting with the committee at the
end of each year.

How to polish seashells ?
Wash the shells thoroughly in
warm soapy water and scrub lightly.
When dry, go over them with a
pointed knife, and scrape off any
rough spots. Polish with any good
kitchen abradant, fine glass-paper
or emery-paper, rub-up with olive-
oil and finish with a silk cloth. A
cloth dipped in hydrochloric-acid
may be used, followed by a wash
in running water and a dry in the
shade, but the acid is unpleasant
to handle and can be dangerous.
It should be used out of doors, and
kept off the hands. Most collectors
prefer a natural finish, not too
highly polished.

Biographical details of champion
shearer John Howe ?
He was usually known as Jack
Howe, and was born at Warwick
(Q.) in 1855. He learnt to shear
on his family’s property, and for
some years was a shearer on the
Darling Downs. In the early
1880’s he started shearing in the
large sheds of Central Queensland
and in the following years recorded
a series of tallies which earned
him a place in pastoral annals.
Howe was equally skilful with
hand-shears and machines. In 1892,
at Barcaldine Downs, he shore in
one day by machine 237 Merinos,
winning the gold medal given by
the makers of the machines for the
highest tally recorded in the colony
during the season. In the same
year at Alice Downs, using hand-
shears, he put through 321 Merinos
in the standard working-day of the
period. This created a record not
bettered by a machine-shearer for
58 years, and one which has never
been excelled by a man with the
“blades.” He spent the latter years
of his life at Blackall, where he
died in 1922. He was also an out-
standing athlete.
How to make potpourri ?
It is simple to make, and no
particular measurements are needed.
Gather petals and leaves of scented
flowers and plants on a sunny dry
morning, and dry them off on sheets
of paper in a shady spot. Place in
the potpourri-jar, with a sprinkling
of any aromatic kitchen spices, all
mixed well together. Suitable
flowers are dark-red roses, violets,
carnations and brown boronia;
leaves of the shrub called scented
verbena, thyme, sage and all parts
of lavender-bushes. A valuable
addition is powdered orris-root
(hard to get from chemists), which
retains a violet odor for many
years. Correct jars with pierced
lids may be obtained from the
Society of Arts and Crafts of
N.S.W., 112 A King Street, Sydney.

Did the men of any ancient
civilisations shave ?
Yes. The Egyptians shaved, and
not the face alone. Petrie’s Social
Life in Ancient Egypt says: “From
prehistoric times the head was
shaven, and a wig worn when out
in the sun. However this custom
arose, it was certainly kept up for
the sake of cleanliness.” Petrie
further says: “Egyptians were a
very cleanly people. The priests
washed in cold water twice every
day and twice every night, and
shaved the whole body every other
day.” Many of the Pharaohs are
sculpted clean - shaven. The
Sumerians shaved their heads, but
they, together with the Persians
and all the Semitic peoples
(Hebrews, Assyrians and Baby-
lonians) wore beards. The
Assyrians and Babylonians wore
their hair and beards in elaborate
corkscrew cuts. The Greeks of
pre-Alexandrian days customarily
wore beards, though sculptures,
dating from the sixth- and fifth-
century b.c. of charioteers and
Olympian athletes depict them as
clean-shaven. It is said that
enamored of his youthful loveliness,
set the habit of shaving among
Greeks and Romans. Sculptures of
Romans show many to have been
beardless.

In response to questions about
the nature and problems of
migrated oil, he said (B. 25/12/’57) :
“Illustrations of the fact
that accumulations of long-
distance migrated oil rarely
lead to commercial fields have
been a commonplace in the
petroleum-winning industry
throughout its century of
existence. This is especially so
where the path of migration
has been ‘tight’ enough to pro-
duce recognisable chemical
and physical changes in the
crude oil.
“The odds against commer-
cial production are shorter
where the seep has been sealed
by impervious beds, deposited
over the land-surface shortly
after the exudation of the oil
has begun, and where the
channels leading to the sealed
surface are comparatively
open.
“Where an oil-manifesta-
tion—unless it is very’ prolific
'-occurs on a surface which has
been exposed to the elements
for a period whose length is of
geological significance, the
chances of commercial produc-
tion are remote.
“It is asking a little too much
of the patron deity of the oil
game—the impish God of
khance—to hope to obtain
Worth-while results by drilling
on, or very near, an oil-seepage.
The ‘pool’ from which the oil
originated very rarely lies
reached the surface. In fact,
this is likely to happen only
where the strata have been sub-
jected to overfolding, producing
repetition of the same reservoir-
bed in the one well, or to
specific types of faulting,
having a similar effect. In
cases —too rare to act as a
guide to the oil-seeker—small
production has been obtained
from vertical beds where the
oil-reservoir has been sealed
at outcrop by its own inspis-
sated (dried-out) residues.
“It is essential to success,
therefore, to find out every-
thing that can be learnt as to
the direction of migration be-
fore deciding on a drilling-loca-
tion in seepage country. The
technique adopted to this end
is a special one ; it is not used,
nor is it necessary, in the
routine structure-mapping of a
‘normal’ oilfield.
“In Australia lack of success
in striking commercial oil below
‘fossil’ (buried) manifesta-
tions has been the invariable
rule —witness Roma, Gippsland,
Exmouth Gulf and South Aus-
tralia. A little further afield
is Vailala (Papua), and the
latest recruit is Aliambata
(Portuguese Timor).
“At Aliambata the failure is
particularly noteworthy, as
surface-oil in measurable —if
not prolific—quantities occurs
in the neighborhood.”
In B. 9/9/’59 he emphasised the
part the chemist would have to

A oil so far recovered, when
obtained in sufficient quantity
for study, has exhibited the
characteristics imposed upon it
by long-distance migration, and
the determination of the paths
which the migration has
followed is of exceptional im-
portance. As the technique
necessary for checking such
paths includes chemical analyses
as well as geological studies and
may be regarded as ‘pure’
research, it would appear to be
a problem for the geologists,
physicists and chemists of the
C.5.1.R.0. working in liaison
with the Mines Departments of
the States involved to take
advantage of these depart-
ments’ intimate knowledge of
local conditions.”
His last summary appeared in B.
18/l/’6O
“/~\ne of the most comforting
of the taking-up of
oil-permits by powerful and
responsible overseas oil
organisations is that a detailed
examination —both geological
and geophysical of the
petroleum potentialities is
certain to be carried out over
the permit-areas. This aspect
has particular reference to the
Great Artesian Basin, where
exhaustive testing is justified—
quite apart from other con-
siderations —by the fact that the
structure represents one of the
last major sedimentary regions
in the world which has not been
extensively drilled for oil.
“If, however, the search for
oil is to rely for its success on
something more than the
chance discovery of a com-
petroleum in beds of Mesozoic
age, my long-held opinion
now shared by several other
experienced geologists—is that
the detailed examination must
be extended to (and concen-
trated upon) the Palaeozoic
strata, where it has become in-
creasingly obvious that the real
prospects of striking worth-
while quantities of indigenous
Australian oil occur.
“The search in these beds is
going to be both difficult and
expensive, and will call for a
technique embodying not only
specialised geology and geo-
physics but also chemistry.
Under the extensions included
in the Petroleum Search Sub-
sidy Bill, 1959, the Govern-
ment will bear a greater part
of the cost than it did under
the 1957-58 Act, but it is un-
fortunate that the additional
aid is largely confined to geo-
physical work; it does not
emphasise the necessity for a
rigid geological control of in-
terpretation, and it does not
even mention chemical aids.”

The departing Governor-General and
Lady Slim were given a rousing send-off
as they drove through the city on their
way to Port Melbourne to join the
Arcadia, in which they are returning to
England. No two people more richly
deserved the plaudits; they have both
done a magnificent job. Women will miss
Lady Slim. Always beautifully dressed
—whether at formal functions or simple
affairs —she was never other than
gracious, friendly and charming. Her
regard for others was typified when, as
they crossed Prince’s Bridge where the
Girl Guides were stationed, she turned
back one glove so that the girls could
see the diamond-and-opal ring that was
their gift to her. A memory always to
be cherished by this Letter was the
rewarding hour spent over coffee with
Lady Slim at Yarralumla, for one of
the most delightful aspects of her nature
was that she invariably accorded one her
undivided attention and displayed the
keenest interest in others’ opinions.
Women’s organisations will miss, too, her
drive and enthusiasm as a patroness of
splendid causes.

At the celebration-luncheon given for
500 guests at the Royale Ballroom by
the Australia Day Council, giant red,
white and blue balloons decorated the
foyer and pillars of the ballroom, and
on every table was the Australian flag.
The Governor, in a stirring speech, pro-
posed the toast of “Australia,” and Sir
John Latham was in his best form in
responding to it. Chairman of the coun-
cil, Sir Norman Martin, with Lady
Martin received the official guests.
Among these were the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress (Cr. Bernard Evans and
Mrs. Evans); State Labor Minister
Reid (representing the Premier) and
Mrs. Reid; Opposition-leader Stone-
ham and his wife ; and Country-party
leader (Sir Herbert Hyland) and Lady
Hyland.
Lady Brooks looked cool and attrac-
tive in a smoke-blue silk frock patterned
in white ; in her hair was a wreath of
blue-and-white forget-me-nots. Lady
Martin chose a frock of white silk
patterned in black and deep-grey and a
high-crowned black hat. A sea-blue silk
frock spotted in white and a white
panama hat swathed with matching
spotted silk were worn by Mrs. Evans.
Mrs. Edgar Brownbill wore with her
white frqck patterned in black flowers
a white petal-cap. Mrs. Ray Joseph’s
white silk frock was coin-spotted in black
and finished with a black sash ; with
it went a black pillbox-hat. Mrs. Hugh
Campbell wore on her frock a pendant

in 1953-54 Patsy went on an overseas
holiday, during which she was presented
to the Queen. Back home, she appeared
in two Shakspeare productions and in
“The School For Scandal" before doing
a 14 months’ tour of Australia and New
Zealand as Bubba in “Summer of the

To celebrate its 25th anniversary the
National Theatre Movement will hold a
festival of opera and ballet at St. Kilda
Palais from March 3 to March 12,
coinciding with the Moomba festivities.
Operas to be presented will be “Aida”
and “Tosca,” and the ballets “Les
Sylphides,” “Le Coq D’Or” and “Swan
Lake.” The Governor and Lady Brooks
will be present on the opening night
with other distinguished guests, includ-
ing the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress
(Cr. and Mrs. Bernard Evans). Prior to
a sherry-party held at the National
Theatre, president Sir Robert Knox
announced that many firms had con-
sented. to sponsor the festival, and he
was hoping that others would follow
suit. Australian singer Robert Allman,
who has been in Europe, will appear
in both operas. Alwyn Smith and Julia
Malyon will also have leading roles.
Helen Keys will dance the main role
in “Swan Lake,” and Helen Ross will

Before the first race the wife of the
club’s chairman, Mrs. T. S. Carlyon,
entertained at luncheon, wearing a deep-
brown cardigan-suit of Thai-silk, the
jacket of which was banded in black
silk-braid ; her high-crowned brown-straw
hat was covered with green leaves and
tiny pink flowers. Guests included Mrs.
John Reilly (wife of the club’s secretary),
who chose a frock and full-length coat
of brown silk patterned in white-and-grey
leaves and a grey fine-straw hat swathed
with grey chiffon ; Mrs. A. W. L. Ellis
(Sydney); Mrs. Sam Wells (her mist-blue
embroidered frock and jacket worn with
a toque of grey-and-mist-blue tulle); Mrs.
R. V. Gove ; Lady Clarke ; Mrs. W. P.

Among the many attractive ensembles
noticed were Mrs. Robert Monahan’s
navy-and-white silk jacket-suit worn with
a picture-hat made of layers of navy-
and-white-spotted organza; Mrs. Robin
Helden’s sheath-frock of white cotton
patterned in strawberries and green
leaves; Mrs. Liel Pizzey’s strawberry-
pink-and-white-spotted silk frock with its
wide upstanding collar and pleated skirt,
worn with a white straw Dior cloche;
Mrs. Les Sangster’s hyacinth-blue floral
frock and tiny white hat; Mrs. Harry
Scott’s sheath-frock was of white linen
embroidered in an all-over pattern and
small white hat of fine straw ; Mrs. W. K.

To celebrate the Chinese New Year’s
Eve, Mr. and Mrs. David Wang gave
a dinner-dance at their Armadale home
for 100 guests. The reception - rooms
were decorated with large bowls ol
colorful mixed flowers, while in the
marquee (where dinner and dancing
were enjoyed) the decorations were
colored-lights and Chinese-lanterns. The
evening included a spectacular fireworks
display in the gardens. Mrs. Wang
greeted her guests wearing a cheongsam

SYDNEY
It was a brave parade that led up to
the Australia Day ceremony this year,
not only because it was colorful and
stirring, but also because it braved a
temperature of 104 degrees—which at
that time we thought impressive.
Detachments of the three Services
were grouped around the Archibald
Fountain (the Navy boys appropriately
on the eastern side where they got the
benefit of the spray), quite a consider-
able number of citizens clustered under
the trees that form a wide circle round
the fountain, and the red-coated Royal
Australian Engineers’ Band played for
Geoffrey Chard’s singing of “Land of
Hope and Glory.” The Governor, Sir
Eric Woodward, Lord Mayor Jensen and
Premier Heffron were eloquent but con-
siderately short in their exhortations.
Ereach Riley, in a simply magnificent
voice, read the Proclamation that
appointed Governor Phillip 172 years
ago, and when youthful Carmel Moss
sang “Advance Australia Fair,” flanked
by Kevin Ardler, from the aboriginal-
reserve at La Perouse, and Ukrainian-
born Myron Schymki (the three 12-year-
olds representing Australia past, present
and future) the crowd stopped wiping
their brows and started wiping their
eyes.
This was not surprising because, on
the. whole, it was quite a soul-stirring
ceremony, rewarding to the many who
came from places as far afield as Toon-
gabbie to see it. No one complained
(much) about the heat. It was worth
enduring, so the feeling ran, to be part
of the adventure that is Australia.
P.S. There was also a fly-past by the
R.A.A.F., but, to be frank, as far as
this Letter was concerned, it was a
flown-past. Those jets certainly can
move!

The Pioneers’ Club had a packed
dining-room when it celebrated Founda-
tion Day and the 150th 'Anniversay
Year of Governor Macquarie’s coming
to Australia on January 29. The official
guests included Mr. W. C. Wentworth,
M.P. (a descendant of Macquarie’s
friend and protege, the original William
Charles), and Mrs. Wentworth, the
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, Mr.
Ray Maher, who is lord over the oldest
Macquarie building, and his wife, the
active secretary of the North Sydney
Historical Society, and Mr. J. Macquarie
Ant ill, descendant of Macquarie’s faith-
ful aide de camp. Others present in-
cluded Mr. Justice and Mrs. Bruce
Macfarlan, Mrs. Rice (president of the
Women’s Pioneer Society) and a repre-
sentative gathering of the old families
who drank the toast of the day, pro-
posed by the president, Mr. Malcolm
Ellis, with enthusiasm.
Alexandra Hasluck, whose new book,
Unwilling Emigrants,” was reviewed on
the Red Page 20/1/'60, is the wife of
historian and Minister for Territories
Paul Hasluck, and the mother of two
teenage sons. She is also an historian
in her own right, both her books (her
first was “Portrait With Background”)
being based on historical themes.
Only child of the late John Darker
(a Queenslander who became Engineer
for railway-construction in W.A.) and
of Evelyn Hill (one of the first women-
graduates of Sydney University), Mrs.
Hasluck was born and educated in W.A.
and is herself a graduate of the W.A.
University, where she met her husband,
then on the staff of the “West Austra-
lian." For a short period she taught at
St. Hilda’s school, but soon went off, on
a honeymoon to Europe. In London
her husband did research at the British
Museum for his first book, “Black Aus-
tralians.” Mrs. Hasluck found herself
also reading history, mainly European.
Back in Australia, they built a pleasant
riverside home at Dalkeith, Perth, where
they still live. Articles published in
newspapers and historical journals stimu-
lated a desire for original research in
scarcely-explored local fields. But war
and family intervened. In 1941, a baby
and a move to Canberra set-off a long
period of change and travel. She went
to New York when her husband became

About 100 party-organisers for the
Elizabethan Theatre had a party
organised for them by the E.T. on
Friday night, when they were given a
chance to see the Theatre Trust’s work-
shops in 'Dowling Street and to meet
members of the cast for the 1960 season.
These included Margot Lee, a special
guest-performer for “The Rape of the
Belt Dinah Shearing, looking the
essence of coolness in something filmy
and soft; Neva Carr Glynn, wearing
an unusual printed cotton featuring
ballet-dancers and such ; and newcomer
Sheila Kennedy, who was noted by
talent-scouts for her work at the Inde-
pendent’s “Sur le Pont,” and has given
up her advertising job to become a pro-
fessional actress.
Arousing attention at this party were
the gorgeous Japanese costumes which
have been made to Elaine Haxton’s
designs for the Trust’s “Madame Butter-
fly,” which, starring Joan Hammond,
will begin the opera season in Australia
at the Adelaide Festival in March.

Which brings us to the world-
premiere of Paul Grinwis’s ballet,
“Journey to the Moon,” which was such
a delightful surprise to those of us who
expected something of the stark outer-
space type of modern ballet, and which
was notable for Elaine Haxton’s mag-
nificent, imaginative costumes. The lady
herself was present, wearing a short
turquoise sheath-dress and a flat black
bow in her white cap of hair. Among
Jhose who enjoyed this refreshing
comedy-romance of a ballet were Mrs.
lan Jacoby in a blue ballerina
besprinkled with flowers, and Mrs. Alec
Morgan (recently back from abroad),
whose son, Dr. Bruce Morgan, escorted
Miss Simone Pirenne, charming in coffee-
colored lace.

Anyone who has seen one of Sydney’s
pretty little parks transformed into a
rubbish-tip over a two-hour lunch-
period, or who has driven off the main
road towards what looks like an ideal
picnic-spot only to find it covered with
old tins, beer-bottles, cigarette-packets,
chocolate-papers, etc., must applaud and
support the Garden Club’s present anti-
litter campaign, for which the children’s
poster-exhibition was opened at David
Jones’ Walk Gallery this week.
It is obvious that if people are to
learn to be tidy they must have some-
where to deposit their rubbish. Last year
250 extra receptacles were distributed
throughout the city, the Lord Mayor
revealed when opening the exhibition ;
but in the suburbs or on the beaches
(with the exception, so one hears, of
Cronulla) there is scarcely a bin to be
seen. A project of the Garden Club is
to have special bags made for use in
cars and the children especially are to
be encouraged to make and use them.
Working for the project, and present at
the exhibition on Wednesday, were Mrs.
Arthur Davis (responsible by art of
persuasion for the extra receptacles so
far distributed), Mrs. George Caiger
(who with Mr. John Appleton organised
the poster-exhibition) and Mrs. G.
Houston (who is president of the
Hunters’ Hill Tree Lovers’ Association,
which is also training the youth of Aus-
tralia to take care of their lovely land).

Helen Coulson’s district history.
Story of the Dandenongs, 1838-1958
(Cheshire), is better produced than most
district histories, which are generally
put out in the formidable format of
an official year-book; but then, the
Dandenongs are much looked-up to in
Melbourne; they have been repre-
sented at Canberra by Lord Bruce,
E. J. Holloway, the Hon. J. V. Fair-
bairn, Rupert Ryan and the Rt. Hon.
Richard Gardiner Casey, now Lord
Casey, who has written a graceful
introduction to this book.
In the Dandenongs, in Sherbrooke
Forest, the lyrebird sings and dances,
first filmed by the Melbourne
naturalist, R. T. Littlejohns, who got
it broadcast over the A.B.C. in 1932;
in the Dandenongs a train called
“Puffing Billy” is kept going on a 2ft.
gauge by a group of citizens who
rescued it from a Government running
it at a loss as a utility, and ran it at
a profit for old time’s sake; yet the
Dandenongs are not too proud, as
Sydney’s more impressive Blue Moun-
tains are, to work for their living:
Scoresby, for instance, grows 90 per
cent, of Victoria’s brussel-sprouts.
Streeton, Tom Roberts and C. J.
Dennis visited, painted and wrote
poetry in the Dandenongs; Tom
Roberts died in his Kallista home; he
was no relative of the John Garibaldi
Roberts of Melbourne Tramways who
furnished 10 obsolete omnibuses at
South Sassafras for his friends, and
paid Dennis so much a week to write
a novel in verse around some verses
he had written for “The Bulletin.”
There is a photograph in this book of
Mr. and Mrs. Roberts, Dennis in a
3in. stiff collar, and Hal Gye, who
still writes for “The Bulletin” —more-
over Olinda, in the Dandenongs, was
the home of Ray Whiting, in the 30’s,
who drew madly for the same paper;
Max Meldrum lived in Olinda for a
while, also J. Jorgenson, Mary Card, a
world-famous crochet-designer, and
Peg Malthby, who writes and illus-
trates children’s books and paints and
makes pottery.
“Billy” Hughes had a home at Sassa-
fras, and entertained the Prince of
Wales there; Clovelly. one of Sassa-
fras’s few guest-houses, was conducted
when it was called Braco Park by an
aunt of Sir Keith Murdoch; Sir John
Latham, former Chief Justice of the
High Court, still holds the property he
bought at Tremont in 1917; A. M.
Nicholas, of the Aspro family, built
a three-story, 24-room castle at Sher-
brooke, with a picture-theatre seating
60, an electric lift in a tower, an
ornamental lake, a five-acre orchid-
nursery, enclosed swimming - pool,
tennis- and squash-courts; he died
before it was finished, and in 1955 it
was turned into research laboratories.
The Dandenong Ranges have had
their ups and downs since the botanist
Daniel Bunce went among them c.
1839-48. They were named from fhe
Dandenong, Dang-y-non or Tanjenong
(meaning “lofty”) Creek, which was
named from the town, or vice versa;
though some derive “Dandenong” in
some tortured way from “No Good
Damper Inn” on the Melbourne road.

In the wreck of the 1890’s the Gov-
ernment put indigent city-dwellers on
_ 10-acre blocks in the Dandenongs; and
there they learned the craft of splitting
palings, of which Mrs. Coulson gives
a fascinating account. The first and
most difficult job was to select trees
that would split straight; these were
felled, cut into 6ft. lengths, and then
with a “paling-knife” were split into
rails thick on one edge, Hn.
thick on the other, or into palings—
the palings were used, straight up and
down, evidently, for the sides of
dwelling-huts. Most settlers lived in the
first stages by selling in Melbourne the
wood they cleared from their land. But
how many city-dwellers of today
would care to be exiled to the bush
and have survival depend on learning
so chancy a business as splitting 6ft.
logs and splitting them straight?
After World War I, weekenders sent
up the price of land in the Danden-
ongs, and the mad little train (from
which, it was said, passengers in the
front carriages could alight and pick
flowers and still be in time to get
aboard again on the last carriage)
brought people with cottages and
shacks, and hikers walking four or
five abreast, while at Christmas and
Easter the normal 7000 population was
trebled. But bad bushfires intimidated
tourists in 1923: —
The hills were again ravaged by
fire in 1926, and tourists fled the
district, never to return in such
numbers, nor with the same care-
free spirit. Ruin faced the pro-
prietors of guesthouses and led to
mysterious fires which completely
destroyed many buildings.
The depression brought people to
live in the Dandenongs because of
cheap firewood and backyard poultry;
motor-cars ended the “guesthouse
era” by making the Dandenongs into
a day’s outing; and now the Danden-
ongs are mainly for people who live
and work there or live there and
commute to Melbourne.
Several old-established families have
worked to further Fern Tree Gully
shire’s interests. The Barrys have
been there for more than 100 years;
the first was Edward Barry, kinsman
of Sir Redmond Barry; his son’s wife,
Mrs. William, found the governess in
the garden, her newly-washed hair
spread in the sun and covered with a
swarm of bees: Mrs. Barry, attired for
the garden as was the fashion, in hat,
veil, gloves and tight-fitting sleeves, cut
off the governess’s hair. Well, this
resourceful lady’s granddaughter is
Councillor Violet Barry Lambert, for
more than 20 years a member of the
shire council, president of the shire in
1946 and chairman of the Historical
Records Committee which authorised
this history.
Then there is the Chandler family,

cross of cauliflower and cabbage—his

son began growing boronia on Dan-
denong Creek in 1873; he, his son and
his two grandsons have been members
or presidents of the shire council; and
in 1915, when they wanted to name
a new district in the shire “Chandella.”
A E. Chandler chose instead
“Boronia,” after the acres of it he had
growing.
Then there are the Knox’s, the
Nobelius's, the Dargons, etc., etc.; but
one should also mention Mrs. Murphy,
of One Tree Hill, who roped a 2001 b.
sack of flour to two sticks and “with
the aid of another person carried it up
the hill from Fern Tree Gully”; and
J, Guttmann (later Goodman), who
built Olinda Wine Hall because the
Methodists invoked a law that a hotel
could not be within eight miles of
another hotel; and William Hermon,
of Menzies’ Creek, who conveyed
Father Christmas around the suburbs
in a bullock-dray, and whose bullocks
appeared on stage in “The Span of
Life”; and Jack Murphy, who picked
up the anvil at Nick Bergin’s black-
smith’s shop at Rowville and carried
it across the road, they having said
that an Afghan hawker called “Old
Ihmer” could do it. and when they
asked Murphy to carry the anvil back
again he said: “Not on your life. Get
Ihmer to do it.”
There is also a note on “The Press”
(page 142), and how it published
“maps illustrating the location of
councillors’ properties in relation to
new roads” and how papers changed
and changed hands —a sad summary,
a sad summary.
Large-paper, with many fine, nostal-
gic old photographs; notes to chapters,
appendices of political representatives;
a full appendix of councillors; and a
14-page index of names, three columns
of small type to a page—the only thing
they’ve saved on is maps: the two
endpaper maps are quite inadequate.
Early Music
Ranging from separate investigations
of Ambrosian, Gallican, Mozarabic
and Gregorian chant, thence moving
broadly through the rise of four-part
vocal harmony, pure instrumental
music, early oratorio, cantata, chorale-
prelude, etc., and finishing with a
snappy piece of Pergolesi reeitativo
secco, Carl Parrish’s A Treasury of
Early Music (Faber) is an important
addition to the list of reference-books
aimed at showing contemporary
musicians that the old boys aren’t so
stuffy after all.
Dr. Parrish has 50 short chapters,
e ach tied to a specific musical extract
incidentally, m notation large
enough to read at the piano. The
chapters are unique in their mixture of
technical and historical advice. Explain-
ing the beginnings of lauda, mid-13th
century Italian ecclesiastical pop.-songs,
Parrish says:—
Inspired by the example set by St.
Francis of Assisi of joyfully
embracing poverty, and also moved
to penitence by the harrowing ills
of the age, bands of penitents roamed
in pilgrimage over the north of
1ta1y.... It was in such a milieu
that the... .lauile spirituali arose....
One turns the page to find the trans-
lation of the text, and suddenly the
informative history-lesson modulates to
a discourse on phrasing, metre and
melodic rhyme, salted with the observa-
tion that “the melody is in the
Hypoaeolian mode.” Modes are
covered rather more fully in the first
four chapters, particularly in the musi-
cal extracts.
Parrish is extremely good on chant,
and in his passion for the specific gives
useful outlines of the growth of the
Roman sung liturgy. It would be
unkind to say that there are any serious
omissions in such an anthology, cover-
ing masterworks of the Middle Ages,
the Renaissance and the Baroque
periods; but it might have been just as
well to have included a separate
chapter on the beginnings of Anglican
chant. The material is largely there,
by inference and example, but one
question still perplexes the present
reviewer: at what exact period did
Anglican chant, with its primarily
harmonic basis and its fixed length,
emerge from its Roman plainsong
chrysalis?
But there is a fabulous Dowland
lute-ayre, “My Thoughts are Wing’d
With Hope,” which has nothing to do
with church-music (the words certainly
not) except that the music, in its fragile
beauty, has a certain purity of style
one associates with church-music
composition at its best:—
My thoughts are wing'd with hopes,
my hopes with love,
Mount love, unto the moon in
clearest night,
And say as she doth in the heavens
move,
In earth so wanes and waxeth my
delight.
And whisper this but softly in her
ears,
Hope oft doth hang the head, and
trust shed tears.
It would be miles more interesting
at a wedding than “I’ll Walk Beside
You.”
John Bull’s “Pavana for the
Virginal” is quoted in full, and the
amateur pianist might find some of the
16th-note figuration tricky, to say
nothing of the indicated ornaments.
Parrish thinks that “the use of such
embellishments was probably left to
the discretion of the player,” and one
would say he’s right. The fact remains
that trills, mordants and turns sound
far less satisfactory on the modern
piano than they do on a harpsichord
or clavichord. There might be some
justification for leaving them out
altogether when such pieces are played
on the piano.
There are chapters on violin-music,
organ-music, opera. One thing the
book demonstrates is the rock-solid
basis of church-music and its relation
to the growth of other forms. In fact,
music of the church appears to have
infiltrated and domineered the early
scene. One would like to see a
companion-volume, titled perhaps “A
Treasury of Later Music,” with 50
matching chapters illustrating con-
temporary trends. But few musicians
could afford to go without such a
valuable anthology.
