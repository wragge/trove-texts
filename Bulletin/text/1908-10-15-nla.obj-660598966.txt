THE RED PAGE
Verses by J. le Gay Brereton
I wove the fragrant boughs around
A mossy rock, and made a shrine
—An altar upon holy ground —
And here I poured ecstatic wine,
And broke my daily bread, and found
That Heaven and Earth and Hell were mine.
I spilled some wine upon the clay,
And moulded it with rugged skill
And made the lamp which here I lay.
For lovers kneeling here shall fill
My lamp on many a distant day.
And haply keep it burning still.
THE GRAVE.
In the grey daivn I lie within my bed
Still as a frozen lake that pats no more
With murmuring delight the o'erhanging shore,
Yet grim thoughts heave obscurely in my head ;
For curtains I have earthen walls, and lead
Is colder than the woollen garb I wore.
But, O, that heart of mine is still as sore
As when I did not know that I was dead.
I knew her (0 my Life !) and she was fair,
And gave her beauty to the hills and sea.
The wonder of her voice to leaf and wave.
The brown earth lies between us ; does she care
That since she cast the first dull clod on me
My lonely heart is aching in the grave 1
PANIC.
Out of the night
Springs wide-eyed with lips apart
Fright,
And clenches with intangible hand
About my struggling heart.
He twists me round
Obedient to inaudible command
And drives me, hounds me headlong down the slope,
Splashing in haste across the sodden ground.
God help us—hark !
What infant fear or dying hope
Is erying, crying, crying in the dark l
CLING TO ME.
Cling to me, love, and dare not let me go:
Km me as though it ivere our time to die,
And all our comradeship had drifted by.
Who knows what face to-morrow 1 s dawn may show l
All the night opens round us, dear ; and 10,
Mysterious deeps wherefrom the unseen eye
Of formless dread is gazing sleeplessly !
Over our love what shelter can 1 throw ?
How long have ive been seeking, and how far,
With time and space betwixt us, till at last
Our instant life makes glory of our pain l
The awful Night is round' us. Star on star
Calls us to wander, when our moment's past,
—Perchance upon that desolate quest again.
DREAM SHAPES.
Steal softly, visions of the night,
And do not break her rest,
But breathe a slumberous deep delight
Within her quiet breast.
Strange dream, whose face and form are mine,
Lie silent at her side
In healing peace and thought divine,
While shadowy moments glide,
Each leaving, as it wanders by,
A gift of special grace.
And on the pillow ’twixt you lie,
0 dream, a little face.
Perpetual Motion
IN a recent article we mentioned the
impasse into which modern science
had come in its efforts to prove the
eternal existence of the universe. It is
accepted now that matter is indestruct-
ible ; but modern thinkers are not so
sure that energy will not wear out. There
is a feeling that the universe is losing
energy, inconceivably slowly, but inevit-
ably. If this tired feeling of the cosmos
cannot be checked, we must contemplate
an ultimate universe of dead matter
clumped together by gravity in one enor-
mous inert and frozen mass.
However, modern science will not take
that decision lying down ; and more than
one theory has been put forward to ex-
plain how the machine may be con-
structed so that, not one particle of energy
is ever lost. Svante Arrhenius, in his re-
markable Worlds in the Making (Har-
per), has a feasible suggestion of escape
from the theory of the inevitable “de-
gradation ” of energy. According to that
theory all the energy of the universe will
ultimately come to a “heat death,” or
thermal equilibrium : the cosmos will be
of one uniform heat throughout, and
therefore incapable of doing any work.
Arrhenius’ postulate is that energy is
“ degraded ” in bodies which are in the
solar state, and energy is “ elevated,”
raised to a higher level, in bodies which
are in the nebular state. He conceives
that the universe has always been in its
essence what it is now. Matter, energy
and life have varied only as to shape and
position in space.
We may imagine the interior of the sun
charged with compounds which, brought to
the surface of the sun, would dissociate
under an enormous evolution of heat and an
enormous increase of volume. These com-
pounds have to be regarded as the most
powerful blasting agents, by comparison
with which dynamite and guncotton would
appear like toys.
In other words, every star is a danger-
ous dynamite charge, and ought at once
to be brought under the legislation re-
lating to explosives.
The discovery of the radiation pres-
sure of light that light actually
repels particles and thus overcomes
the attraction of gravity—has given
Arrhenius his clue to his theory.
Owing to the fact that gravity attracts
in proportion to the mass of a particle,
while the light repulses in proportion to
the surface of the particle, it is obvious
that if a spherule is sufficiently small it
will be repulsed from the sun against the
pull of the sun’s gravity. As Snyder, in
The Cosmic Machine, which discusses this
theory, puts it:
The mass of a body decreases in propor-
tion to the cube of its diameter, but the
surface decreases in proportion to the square.
It follows, therefore, that with smaller and
smaller bodies the relations between the
force of attraction and of light pressure
progressively alter ; gravitation decreases
much more rapidly than the force of light.
It is evident that there will come a point
whon the pressure of light is actually greater
than the pull of attraction. At this point
the particle has become exceedingly small;
but it will then be shot away from a highly
luminous body, even against the tremendous
gravitational pull of the sun itself.
Such a particle would travel at im-
mense speed, reaching the earth from the
sun in a few hours. And it is from these
particles meeting in space and fusing
together that meteorites are probably
born. An analysis of the loose structure
of meteorites confirms this theory.
In this fact Arrhenius has found
the perpetual motion of the universe.
Gravity and light act as the forward and
the backward beat of the cosmic piston ;
and we need not, therefore, fear the ulti-
mate clumping together of all the particles
of matter, including us.
But the theory explains more. ' The
particles expelled by the pressure of light
from the sun and stars are electrically
charged, and thus, incidentally, are re-
cognisable from the earth as the cause
of the polar lights, and other electrical
phenomena.'
vf/
And here Arrhenius makes use of his
other theory of explosive suns. After
life has ceased on the earth the sun will
condense and cool, but will retain its
heat for an inconceivable period, full of
gas under such immense pressure that
the sun will resemble a vast dynamite
magazine. Then it will ultimately meet
another dynamite magazine; and the
consequences will be worse than Bray-
brook. And with the explosive force
generated certain molecules of the gas
will be shot clear away from the gravita-
tion attraction of the nebula formed by
the smash-up, where, owing to the enor-
mous distances, the restraining force of
gravity—itself the weakest of all known
forces—-is exceedingly feeble.
Thus the nebulae will lose their most rapid
molecules from their outer portions, and
they will therefore be cooling in these outer
strata. If, now, there were only 'nebulae of
one kind in the whole universe, these escaped
molecules would finally land on some other
nebula, heat equilibrium would, thus be
established between the different nebulae,
and the “ heat-death ” would be established.
But the nebulae enclose many immigrated
celestial bodies, which are able to condense
the gases from their neighborhood, and
which thereby assume a higher temperature.
The lost molecules of gases may also stray
into the vast atmosphere of these growing
stars. By such processes the clock-work of the
universe may be maintained in motion with-
out running down.
W
Under Newton’s law of gravitation the
celestial bodies should tend to draw together,
to unite in ever-growing masses. In the
infinite space of past time the evolution
should have proceeded so far that some large
suns, bright or extinct, could alone persist.
All life would be impossible under such cir-
cumstances.
Yet we have found space full of' dust,
nebulse, and dark and bright suns of
moderate size, and planets.
The explanation of these apparent devia-
tions from the necessary consequence of the
exclusive action of gravity will be found in
the action of the mechanical radiation pres-
sure of light, and in the collisions between
celestial bodies. The latter produce enor-
mous vortices of gases about nebular struc-
tures ; the radiation pressure carries cos-
mical dust into the vortices, and the dust
collects into meteorites and comets. The
scattering influence of the radiation pres-
sure, therefore, balances the tendency of
gravitation to concentrate matter. The vor-
tices of gases in the nebulae only serve
to fix the position of the dust, which
is ejected from the suns through the ac-
tion of the radiation pressure In the
more rarefied, gaseous, cold portions of the
nebulse we find that part of the machinery of
the universe which checks the waste of
matter, and, still more, the waste of force
from the suns. . . . Thus every ray emitted
by the sun is absorbed, and its energy is
transferred, through the gaseous particles of
the nebulse, to suns that are being formed.
The explosive substances, formed by
the cooling of the suns, and dissipated at
their collision, play the chief part in this
evolution.
The enormous stores of energy concen-
trated in these bodies perform the duty
of powerfully acting fly-wheels interposed in
the machinery of the universe in order to
regulate its movements and to make certain
that the cyclic transition from the nebular to
the star stage, and vice versa., will occur ... in
an eternal circle, in which there is neither
beginning nor end, and in which life may
exist and continue for ever and undimin-
ished.
vl/
But Arrhenius makes a vastly more
comprehensive claim for his theory.
By means of it he accounts for
the presence of life on this globe.
He is not concerned with the origin of
life ; he assumes that life, like matter and
energy, have always been parts of the
mechanism of the universe. But the old
question arises: how is life generated
from matter? Arrhenius does not worry
about the generation of life, but shows
in his theory how life conceivably might
be disseminated through space, carried
from one star to another. He calls this
theory “ Panspermia.” According to it,
life-giving seeds (germs) are always drifts
ing about in space. They encounter the
planets, and fill their surfaces with life
as soon as the necessary conditions for
the existence of organic beings are estab-
lished. This, in a newer and more
scientific form, is the exploded sugges-
tion that life might have been carried
to this globe by meteorites. (This
theory was enunciated by Kelvin
in 1871.) For a meteorite arrives
in flame; its speed raises it to incan-
descence by contact with the atmosphere
of the earth, thus destroying the ger-
minating power of all. possible seeds or
germs.
\t/
It is to his theory of the repul-
sive radiation pressure of light, which on
spheres of a certain minuteness is more
powerful than the attraction of gravity,
that Arrhenius turns ; and he finds that
there are germs of the required minute-
ness known to biologists. Supposing
spores could escape from the earth by
being carried on an ascending air current
to the higher strata of our atmosphere,
and then, taking up a charge of negative
electricity from the solar dust during an
electric discharge, driven out into the sea
of ether by the repulsive charges of the
other particles, Arrhenius advances argu-
ments, too long for detailing here, to
show that the germinating power of such
spores could be retained intact for long
periods by the intense cold of space. One
of these many spores might fall on a
world that is conditioned to support life.
And on arrival, if, as is probable, this
spore was adhering to a particle of
cosmic dust, it would fall into the atmo-
sphere of that planet at quite a moderate
speed, and thus not be burnt up like a
meteorite. But the spores that met a
new solar system would not fall into the
sun, but be turned back by the radiation
pressure, and having lost the enormous
velocity wherewith they travelled from
one star to the next, would accumulate
somewhere near that sun, ready to fall
on any planet that happened to come
that way.
In this manner life may have been trans-
planted for eternal ages from solar system to
solar system, and from planet to planet in
the same system.
Seems clumsy, doesn’t it?
J. le Gay Brereton
With the spring has come the wattle and
the whispered message of J. le Gray. It is a
feminine and elusive message, hardly more
than a mood. For J. le Gay Brereton, in
his volume of verse, Sea and Shy (Lothian,
Melb.) is as distant as the sky and'as damp
as the se i, and in his little lyrics tiny clouds
drift softly over the blue and melt into
nothingness, and gentle wavelets ripple
pleasingly into peace.. It is true that the
poet stridently remarks that his is
A harsh, not all discordant note;
but J. le Gay is never harsh. He polishes
his little pebbles so lovingly that they have
the look of a schoolboy’s bag of marbles.
And we long in vain for a chunk of jagged
rock. Yet his labor results in some ex-
quisite things exquisitely said :
Shadow, a terror unshaken, who smothers the
breath with affright,
Sits like a statue uncarved in the heavy black mass
of the night. ...
And the insolent pomp of the ape in a robe of
state
And the sliding silence of guile.
Brereton, having nothing new to say, says
it charmingly ; and the work in this book is
not disfigured by the inclusion of anything
slovenly or false. His “Progress of the
Year ” is, maybe, the only unpoetic thing he
publishes. His “maidens fifty-two,” of
whom he remarks :
Seven-branched the candlestick
Each pale novice bears,
is a little too mathematically precise to be
poetry. But it is in the mastery of language
that the poet makes his final appeal. His
cunning use of alliteration in such a phrase
as :
When he comes at last
To Autumn’s welcome gateway, past
The orchards where the peaches grow,
shows him, as it showed his master, Tenny-
son, at his best.
Towards the end of his little book of
lyrics, Brereton grows rather too domestic
for the taste of the general reader. The
section “ Oithona,” with such charming
verses as these :
When shall we kiss that blossomy face of thine,
Oithona, when across the starlit straits
Thou flit teat till the hither region shine
With fires of welcome, and, her hand in mine,
Thy longing mother waits ?
O parted, smiling lips, so tender red,
When shall our ears that oft in dreams have
heard
Quaint prattle and glad laughter, and were fed
As starving men in visions, taste instead
At last a waking word ?
will, however, be read with interest by
those of our readers who are expecting by
practical means to aid in the solution of the
population problem. It is, however, the
father, not the poet, speaking when he in-
forms us of Oithona that:
Her soul shall be untamed,
And she will front the sun brown-skinned and
unashamed.
On the whole, this is a contribution to
Australian verse of which Australia need not
be ashamed. Such careful work, so deli-
cately done, is a rare portent in our vague
Australian sky ; and such criticism as has
been given to it has been occasioned by the
slightness of a message so poetically worded.

Dent’s “ Everyman ” series, Frowde’s
“World’s Classics,” Routledge’s “New

GENERAL
DEBILITATION.
THE LIVER BLAMED.
Sincerity of conviction and directness of pur-
pose mark the action of Mr. Thomas Theak in
giving for publication the ensuing lines, which
were written at his home, No. 88 Botany Road,
Alexandria.
“I am one of the few people living in Sydney
who has never been out of it,” was Mr. Theak’s
initial remark, “not that it is anything to boast
about, but purely an uncdmmon circumstance.”
“Your business does not conduce to much
travelling, perhaps?” said the interviewer.
“I’m a painter by trade, and there has been
plenty of work to keep me here, without wasting
time looking for it in other parts. Yes ; I have
done fairly well from a business standpoint, but
from a health point of view I was not always so
fortunate. Let me give you, for example, the
time that I found it necessary to start taking
medicine, and I must have been pretty bad to
*take that on, I tell you. It was because I was
much weaker than 1 should have been, conse-
quent, I firmly believe, on working too hard. I
had the unpleasant experience of never being able
to relish my food, no matter how daintily pre-
pared, for my appetite had fallen away to nothing.
I was also troubled with most uncomfortable feel-
ings, following upon the taking of foods, the
stomach filling with gases, and causing pain, be-
sides being oppressed with a dreariness of mind
which made it too much trouble to devote my
thoughts to anything. I felt fit for nothing but
to go and lie down after meals, and a person in a
healthy state should not be like that, you know.”
“That condition is a sure indication that some-
thing has gone wrong with the liver?”
“Precisely; and that’s what I was suffering
from. I went on ailing for a good length of time,
going from bad to worse, and wondering what on
earth would cure me and make my life a bit more
bearable, when a son of mine who had been using
Clements Tonic advised me to try some. Well,
that was the best introduction I have ever had,
because Clements Tonic has been a firm friend of
mine ever since. But before I get too far ahead
of my story, let me tell you of the way I suffered
from headaches —so heavy and acute that I could
scarcely raise my head from the pillow, and mak-
ing me wish that I could leave this earth and all
its misery behind. A coated tongue and a vile
taste in the mouth started the day’s round of dis-
agreeable circumstances, and my sight got so dim
as to lead me to think that a skin was growing
over them. Then the giddy feelings—why, some-
times I almost dropped, through their sudden
visits, and my shoulders were so affected with
pain that it hurt me to move. Indeed, on one
occasion I was for a whole week and could not
raise my arms. The chest and stomach were also
out of gear, and on top of it all I was listless and
low-spirited to a marked degree. Each morning I
got up feeling that I did not care what happened,
always being more inclined to go back to bed
again than to dress myself. There was sufficient
evidence to show that my nervous system was feel-
ing the strain of my physical adversities, so you
will see there was a big contract in front of Clem-
ents Tonic when I made my first purchase of that
valuable remedy. But I found it very much up-
to-date, believe me. There was no taking of half-
a-dozen bottles, and feeling no better, as applies
to other medicines. Oh !no ; neither do I say that
I felt all right after taking one bottle of Clements
Tonic ; yet I can truthfully assert that I felt some-
what relieved, and that by judiciously sticking to
that treatment I conquered in the end. Yes,
Clements Tonic gained a complete mastery over
each of my ailments, and left me in the happy
position of being able to eat and drink whatever
I liked, without experiencing any ill effects after-
wards. Its power over the nerves is extraordi-
nary, its appetising influences are unique, its value
as a promoter of sleep is unrivalled, and for curing
indigestion and building up one’s strength I’m
positive there is nothing to come within coo-ee of
Clements Tonic.”
“ Well, we’ll print your remarks ? ”
“Do—in any form you like to mention, or de-
cide upon.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.

“ Pneumonia left my son
Leslie, aged 4, with very
weak
lungs
and such a cough that his
poor little body was nearly
racked to pieces. I tried
many preparations without
benefit and really thought he
would die. On the doctor’s
recommendation I gave
Scott’s Emulsion and he
steadily began to improve.
Very soon he was stronger
and better than he had ever
been before ; he is now a
fine boy and owes his life to
Scott’s. He likes Scott’s.”
78 Glebe St.,Glebe, (Mrs.) N. MOORE.
Sydney, N.S.W. 4/9/07.
ABOVE IS THE PROOF IN THE FACTS.
HERE IS PROOF IN THE REASON WHY:
SCOTT’S cured the lungs and
strengthened the system because
SCOTT’S is made of the finest,
purest, most invigorating cod liver
oil in the world—the oil, namely,
which comes from the
livers of cod fish caught
off the Lofoten Isles
(Norway), where they
are primest; and be-
cause this oil is made
easy to take and digest,
by the original perfec-
ted SCOTT process.
Remember: SCOTT’S
cured this little boy,
not an emulsion “just
as good ” no emul- i
ħ
sion is “just as good ” as SCOTT’S.
Therefore, when purchasing, don’t
ask for “ Emulsion ask for and get
Scott’s
Emulsion
—the difference between them
means a cure for you ! See that “the
Fishman with the Fish” is on the

Length of years is commoner than of old —centenarians are
on the increase. This is partly due to greater enlightenment in
matters of hygiene, but not a little to those famous centenarians,
Cockle’s Antibilious Pills, which have been regularly prescribed
by the medical profession since the year 1801. Truly a glorious
record! They are simply unrivalled as a remedy for all dis-

A Rhyme of Rolling Forties.
The salted sea
Delights not me
In picture, song, or story ;
I want no more
Of waves that roar
And swell in foaming glory.
A-near the Line
The weather’s fine;
But when you go
Where winds do blow,
And get amidst the hail and snow,
In May or June—yah ho ! yah ho 1
A sea trip then no sport is.
Disgusting tricks the ocean played,
When, from the Cape to Adelaide,
The good ship Boshter’s course was laid
Along the Rolling Forties.
One’s attitudes
In latitudes
That verge on number 50
Are apt to make
A body ache,
So bent are they, and shifty.
You spread your feet
To keep your seat,
Or slide and slip
Around the ship,
And sprain your leg, or bruise your hip,
And in your cabin “ get the pip ”
For tightly closed the port is ;
And, as the moments drag along,
Half right side up, and inside wrong,
You listen for the dinner gong,
And curse the Rolling Forties.
No blessed boat
That goes afloat
(Though none be trim and tauter)
Shall bear my weight
To 48
In South Pacific water.
For there I froze
And nursed my woes
On water that
Was never flat,
But rose and fell
Like hill and dell,
And moaned as though not feeling well.
When parsons threaten me with H—ll
Emphatic my retort is.
H—ll’s latitudes are warm, no doubt,
But small discomforts one can flout,
Who has for days been knocked about
Among the Rolling Forties.

Spring Morning.
The hours speed blue and sunny,
Busy the wild bee thrums,
Now manna-dew and honey
Spill o’er from old red gums.
Spring reawakens, spreading
Her garment wattle gold ;
She chants Earth’s hymn of wedding,
Lambs frisk within the fold.
Warm morning winds come flocking,
Birds twitter in the nest;
The mother croons, a-rocking
Her baby at the breast.
The Bush gleams fresh and dewy,
At last by Chatting Creek
A swagman, humping bluey,
Finds what he tramped to seek.
To Earth, grown old and crabby,
The joy of youth she brings,
' The bloom, the bud, the baby—
All tender, wistful things.
She smooths out Winter’s wrinkles ;
And from her charmed horn
With holy dew she sprinkles
The Resurrection Morn.

Vanity Fair.
0 Vanity Fair, Vanity Fair !
My heart goes back to you.
For I only found you dear and rare—
And I only found you true.
What matter to me your brazen marts,
Your jests and fickle ways,
For me you’re the city of light young hearts.
And dear delicious days !
O Vanity Fair, where lies your blame?
Our life is but a span ;
And love and joy, and maybe shame,
Make up the life of man.
For we are dead—a long time dead—
And swift are the bright hours gone,
Though short the days of joy ahead,
We’ll follow the piper on.
O Vanity Fair, how oft we laughed,
How many songs we sung ;
The toasts we drank, and the wine we quaffed,
When all the world was young !
1 drink to those delicious days,
1 drink to the girls I kissed,
And ever I sigh for the vanished ways,
And the maids I may have missed.
0 Vanity Fair, with your skies so blue—
A banner above your head—
My heart goes back to the lure of you,
And the young years, dear and dead.
O Vanity Fair, Vanity Fair !
For me the grey years start,
But over the seas of spice and myrrh
The long winds bear my heart.

The Multiplying and Vanishing Billiard Ball Trick.
Unique Billiard Ball.
ħ
By far the best and most effective billiard
ball trick ever invented. This is a superior
method to any other billiard ball trick ever
yet performed. The pecularity of it is that
the balls can be given for examination as
they are produced, to show they are solid.
The performer having turned up his sleeves
and shown his hands empty, gives a minia-
ture billiard ball, about one inch in diame-
ter, for examination. The audience being
satisfied, he takes it in his left hand and
passing his right hand over it shows two.
Again a mystic pass, and there are three,
which he shows are quite solid. The audi-
ence now see, to their astonishmet, four
balls. These gradually vanish one after the
other, till there is only one left, which is
again passed round for examination. An
adequate description cannot be given of this
most delightful effect. If is one of the
prettiest little sleights seen for a long time.
The billiard ball set is made in *• ivorine,"
and can be made in any size. The illustra-
tion will give our customers some idea of
the effect that can ;»o obt.i, ,vith this complete set. The sleeves are turned
back whilst performing this trick the whole time, the hands shown empty, and
at any minute, whilst the trick is beiug- performed, the halls can he passed for
inspection.
This trick requires no sleight of hand, and can he performed by any person.
The balls can be made to multiply or vanish at the will of the operator.

THE YASS-CANBERRA CAPITAL: A
NEW DEVELOPMENT.
The ballot in the House of Representatives for a
Federal Capital produced a remarkable and unex-
pected result. At the first ballot Dalgety received
27 votes, and nine other sites acquired 45 votes
among them—an average of five suffrages apiece.
Lake George couldn’t raise a single vote. The
boasted Canberra got one; Tumut, which was
once chosen as the capital, collected three votes;
Lyndhurst had half-a-dozen. But as one dead
site after another dropped out, votes concentrated
on a new locality described as “Yass-Canberra,”
and in the last ballot it beat Dalgety by six votes.
Of course this resolution isn’t final, for the Senate
has yet to have its say ; but assuming that
the Senate endorses the selection, and Yass-
Canberra is decided on by both Houses, then a
new and interesting set of complications will
arise. For the new site is large and vague. It is
generally described as a triangle touching Yass at
one point, Canberra at another, and Lake George
at a third. This means the surrender by N.S.W.
of a fairly-large mass of territory, and inside this
territory there is space for several wild-cat fights
as to the location of the capital city itself. These
fights have still to come off, and they promise a
fair amount of excitement.
+ * * *
Furthermore, the Yass-Canberra crowd cadged
for votes by certain representations and half-
promises that may lead to a lot of
worry later on. There was a burning desire to
shift the capital site from Dalgety for two reasons.
One was the desire of the State Frights party to
assert the supremacy of the N.S.W. State Legis-
lature over the Parliament of all Australia by
driving the latter body to give up, at the bidding
of the State Legislature, the place it had origin-
ally selected. The other was the craving to bring
the capital closer to Sydney, so that its trade
might further congest that already congested port,
and concentrate more population in a district
which is already ninety times more thickly peopled
than the average of the State. In its haste to do
these things, the Yass-Canberra crowd took
chances. One of Dalgety’s strong points is the
splendid Snowy River and its tributaries—a
cataract of mountain water, tumbling eternally
down from the Kosciusko range, bringing with it
an unlimited supply of drinking material and
water power, and so situated that, with a capital
at Dalgety, it must necessarily be located in
Federal territory, and under Federal control.
Another great advantage is the handy and con-
venient Federal port of Twofold Bay. Against
these the Yass-Canberraites, in their anxiety to
grab votes, set the Barren Jack reservoir as a
source of water supply and water power, and
Jervis Bay as an even better harbor than Two-
fold Bay. And by doing this they gave two sort-
of-hvpothetical I 6 U’s, which will require a very
considerable amount of redemption.
* * * *
In the first place, will the N.S.W. State Govern-
ment surrender its boasted Barren Jack reservoir,
and the streams that supply it, to the Common-
wealth ? If it won’t do so, then the Common-
wealth will never be more than a lodger in a
strange house, and the Commonwealth will pro-
bably object. There is water —though not too
clean water—in Barren Jack, but if it is to be ex-
clusively the State’s water, then the Federal city
will only get a drink on sufferance, and the first
time it gets into a condition of disagreement with
the State Government it may get no drink at all.
There is also a certain amount of water power to
be obtained from Barren Jack, though not so
much as could be acquired from the Snowy; but
if it is to be exclusively the State’s power supply,
then the Federal city will only use it by
the State Government’s permission and kind
forbearance, and whenever it chances to have
a squabble with Wade or his successors
it may find its electric light turned into
darkness and its power supply vanished.
It isn’t sufficient for the State Government to say
that only a shocking slanderer would suggest that
it would do anything of this sort. If it insists
on retaining possession of Barren Jack, then it
carefully insists on having the power to do both
these things, and it is in the position of having
strained every nerve to get the Federal city shifted
from a place where it would have its own water
and power supply to a spot where it will only have
these things at the State Government’s discretion.
And there is no reason why the Wade Ministry
should make such extraordinary efforts to get an
extraordinary and dangerous power unless it
intends to use that power when it feels inclined.
Barren Jack reservoir has been pushed forward so
persistently as one of the advantages of the Yass-
Canberra site that it is evident that the eligibility
of that site depends largely on Barren Jack. If it
doesn’t, then the whole business is something of a
confidence trick. And if it does, and the Aus-
tralian Government doesn’t get Barren Jack, and
has no more control over it than over the Sea of
Galilee, that will also be something of a confidence
trick. Should it be that the waters of Barren
Jack and of the streams which feed it must needs
be divided between the Federal and State
authorities, then it is obvious that either the
Commonwealth must own the supply and the
State must trust to its honor to do the fair thing,
or else the State must own the supply and the
Commonwealth must trust to it to be honest and
reasonable. There are two very solid reasons why
the former course should be adopted. First, if
the State cut off the Commonwealth’s water
supply it would reduce a big city to awful dis-
tress, while, if the Commonwealth cut off the
State’s supply, it would merely dry up a few
farms. Second, the State has plenty of other
water supplies ; the Commonwealth, if its capital
is planted on the Yass-Canberra triangle, will
apparently have no other supply worth mention-
ing.
* * * *
The question of a Federal port will also call for
quite a heap of consideration. In the advocacy
of, first, the Canberra site, and, second, the Yass-
Canberra site, a great deal was made of the fact
that Jervis Bay is a splendid harbor —better even
than Twofold Bay, the sea-outlet of Dalgety. But
if it transpires that the N.S.W. State Government
doesn’t propose to transfer Jervis Bay to the
Commonwealth, then all the votes that have been
gained by the booming of that harbor have been
gained under false pretences, and when this
fact is realised, there is a chance of trouble
which may yet knock the Y ass-Can berra
site into a cocked hat. On the other hand,
Yass-Canberra is further from the sea than
Dalgety, and a Yass-Canberra capital, which in-
cludes Jervis Bay, will necessarily involve the
surrender to the Commonwealth of much more
territory than the Australian Parliament asked
for on Monaro, and yet that area was pronounced
by Carruthers and Wade as absurd and un-
thinkable on account of its size. A Federal
city on the site now proposed, with a
Federal territory commencing at Yass on
one side and extending to and including
Jervis Bay on the other, and with the Barren Jack
reservoir and its feeders as a Federal water supply
under exclusive Federal control, would certainly
be a good enough arrangement to satisfy anybody;
and if that is the arrangement which is proposed
the N.S.W. State Legislature can’t be too rapid
in explaining the fact, in order to prevent the
Federal capital shindy breaking out again just
when it is supposed to have settled down.
* * * *
The proposed site for the Federal city lies off
any existing line of railway, and in that respect it
suffers from the same disability as Dalgety. In
fact, it suffers from a worse disability than Dal-
gety. When the Cooma railway in N.S.W. and
the Bairusdale railway in Victoria are connected,
Dalgety will be on a great main railway, extend-
ing from Rockhampton to Adelaide. But the
Yass-Canberra site lies away off an already exist-
ing main railroad. So the idea is to serve it by
means of a branch, or stump, or dog-leg line which
will have no special importance until it is ex-
tended to Jervis Bay, and which, even then, will
be only a branch and a side-show. And
it must be always borne in mind that
the ultimate tendency of the establishment
of a Federal capital and territory on the
Yass-Canberra site will be to cut off the Monaro
district from N.S.W. and add it to the Federal
territory. Monaro, if the Yass-Canberra capital
is established, will be bounded by Victoria on the
south, by the Federal area on the north, by the
sea on the east, and by mountains 7000 ft. high on
the west. There are only two possibilities for such
a place ; either it will ultimately become part of
Victoria or it will in the end become an addition
to the Federal property. Yet, despite all
drawbacks and disadvantages, there is no reason,
why the selection of the Yass-Canberra site should
not be the solution—for a time at least—of a very
difficult problem. Much depends on whether the
booming of Barren Jack as a Federal city water
supply, and Jervis Bay as a Federal port, were
honest recommendations or mere swindles and
stale confidence tricks. If they were put forward
honestly, then there is no reason why the Yass-
Canberra capital should not last until the inevitable
northward movement of population upsets all
present arrangements and lifts the capital into a
new region altogether.
JONAH AND THE WHALE.
I joined in risking: for this State [N.S.W.] the loss of
next door to a purely Revenue Tariff, which loss has,
from my point of view, unfortunately taken place. . . .
Surely few can truthfully deny that, for the sake of
union, N.S. W. has made the greatest sacrifices of any
State in the Commonwealth, notwithstanding its pro-
mised possession of the capital. . . . Permit me to add
that I object to be classified as a Tory. In the Mother
Country, of which I have the honor to be a native, it is
the Protectionists who compose the Tory party, not the
Freetraders. We Freetraders maintain ours is a broader,
fairer, more peaceful and happier fiscal faith than is Pro-
tection, with which, alas, you still seem to be enamored,
not to say infatuated. — Letter by Senator Walker to The
Bulletin (8/10/’GB).
At first glance the connection between the
Prophet above-mentioned and the Senator above-
quoted may seem remote, but it is really closer
than appears. In certain circles it is fashionable
to be two things—strictly orthodox and a believer
in Freetrade. A belief in the absolute accuracy
of Cobden and of Holy Writ are as much a matter
of course as a plug hat and a tidy Sunday
umbrella. Therefore the orthodox person believes
(theoretically) in absolutely free imports and free
competition and in giving no preference whatever
to local over foreign goods. Also he believes
(theoretically) in Jonah and the whale. But as a
matter of fact his faith is only an item of dull old
habit, and arises out of a profound incapacity for
independent thinking. That incapacity makes a
man'keep on believing (theoretically) in what he
doesn’t really believe worth a cent. He hasn’t, in
reality, a penn’orth of faith in a literal Jonah and
a literal whale. He wouldn’t give a shilling of
his own cash for all the whale in that amazing
story—whalebone, oil, ambergris and the entire lot.
And his belief in real Freetrade is just the same.
It is habit—the shell of something that remains
behind after the substance has departed.
* * * *
There was nothing more laughable in all the
Southern Hemisphere than the old N.S.W. Free-
trade party to which Senator Walker belonged.
It was the prize joke and hypocrisy of the century.
Even when it came nearest to Freetrade it heavily
protected, through the Customs, sugar, beer,
wine, tobacco, biscuits, confectionery, jams and
jellies, etc. These represented fairly big indus-
tries. It didn’t protect them for the sake of
revenue, but solely for want of any real confidence
in its own alleged doctrine. The essence of Free-
trade is to place the local product and the foreign
one on an absolute equality. Therefore, if it was
necessary to tax at the Customs the imported
articles above enumerated in order to obtain
revenue, the simple and obvious way to preserve
the blessings of Freetrade, and at the same time to
procure more revenue, would have been to levy
exactly equal Excise duties on the locally made
articles. But there wasn’t one alleged Free-
trader who believed sufficiently in his own Free-
trade to do that. The so-called Freetrade party
deliberately sacrificed much good revenue in order
to depart from its alleged principles. It
didn’t turn traitor to its principles for
money, but it gave away good money
for the privilege of being a traitor. And
this wasn’t the only matter in which it made it-
self a mighty jackass before the Lord. Being
convinced that its wheat, oats and hay industries
couldn’t live under real Freetrade conditions it
subsidised them, surreptitiously, but to an enor-
mous extent, by carrying the produce of these
industries by rail at rates varying from one-half
to about one-sixth or one-eighth of the real cost
of carriage; by carefully differentiating in the
matter of railway rates between N.S.W. produce
coming towards the coast and imported produce
going inland ; by differentiating, in many cases,
in the matter of wharfage rates between N.S.W.
produce exported and foreign produce imported ;
by subsidising the farming industry with total
exemption from local rates, and by many other
underhand devices. One great reason why
N.S.W. never had a real Local Government
system till Protection came along was that it was
necessary to exempt the farmers from local rates
as a sort of surreptitious bonus in order to keep
these bucolic persons afloat under alleged Free-
trade conditions. On top of all it was considered
necessary to give the N.S.W. Freetrade penny
paper 50 per cent. Protection by charging the
imported penny paper Jd. postage while the local
one was carried gratis.
* * * *
Amazing as was the alleged Freetrade tariff of
N.S.W. at the time when the Commonwealth was
established, it is worth while to remember that it
was quite a new tariff, and quite an unusual
departure towards Freetrade. Though it pro-
tected, openly or surreptitiously, some of the
leading industries of N.S.W., yet the Freetraders
did not dare to bring in even that instalment of
Freetrade until the Reid Government had set the
Federation movement going, and felt reasonably
sure that Protection—Federal Protection—was at
hand. When it became almost certain that
the Freetrade system wouldn’t get a long
enough trial to cover its adherents—the . party
that Senator Walker belongs to—with utter
disgrace, th 9 N.S.W. Freetrade party brought
in a tariff that was a wild parodv on
Freetrade, yet came nearer to it than anything it
had previously attempted. Therein it revealed
the fact that it only nominally believed in Free-
trade because it was the “ correct thing ” —just as
it was, and still is, the correct and orthodox thing
to believe that a real meat whale swallowed
Jonah, and that an undigested prophet lived in
the animal for three days. When it was fairly
certain that Freetrade would have a very short
trial, and that the Shoddy party would be able to
profess that its policy had been reluctantly torn
from it by a Federal Parliament dominated by
Protectionist States, one might have thought that
the N.S.W. Freetrade party would have taken
the chance and for once gone the whole hog of
its professed gospel. Yet it dare not go the
whole hog, even when it had reason to believe
that its nominal doctrine would only have
to stand the test of four or five years.
It began at the commencement of 1896 with a
mongrel tariff. It shortly afterwards took the
first step on the back track to Protection by re-
versing its decision to put the sugar industry on a
Freetrade basis. And in 3f years N.S.W. got so
tired of even this partial Freetrade that it threw
out the Reid crowd and called the Protectionists
back to office. As for the early “Freetrade”
tariffs—those of the Parkes and Robertson
period—they were a jest. A Freetrade tariff
that levied a huge Protective duty even on gal-
vanised iron buckets was beneath derision.
* * * *
N.S.W. was the only State which had, for a
lengthy period, an alleged Freetrade party in
office with a strong majority. If that party, of
which Senator Walker seems fairly proud, had
once—even once—gone the entire animal on its
alleged creed, and abolished all the surreptitious
railway and postal preferences, and balanced any
necessary Customs duties with corresponding
Excise duties, in order to keep intact the beautiful
principle of Free Competition, it would have
commanded respect. Every honest belief com-
mands respect. But there was never a single
influential voice raised in N.S.W. —not even that
of Senator Walker —for genuine Freetrade. All
the alleged Freetraders knew that real Freetrade
would bankrupt the great Tooth and Toohey
breweries, would wreck the wine industry, and
the tobacco industry, and the sugar indus-
try, and would shake the wheat industry
to its foundations. Their belief in real Freetrade
was just as sound as the literal faith in Jonah,
which faith they took with them on Sunday, when
they hunted out the plug hat and the silken gamp,
and went to church, and dropped a threepenny
that looked like a small full moon in the plate.
The Bulletin, in its earliest days, was dubious
and uncertain in its fiscal beliefs. One great reason
why it soon became uncompromisingly Protec-
tionist was because it couldn’t find, in all N.S.W.,
one prominent Freetrader who would have real
Freetrade at any price. It reckoned that when a
creed was so foul that its own warmest advocates
wouldn’t touch it, it was a good creed to leave
alone.
* * * *
N.S.W. still sends into the Australian Parlia-
ment a number of representatives of its bogus
“ Freetrade” party, though it is pleasing to note
that they are growing fewer at each election.
Their attitude, and the attitude of the papers
which back them, has created an ill-feeling against
the eldest State of the Commonwealth that will
not be eradicated for years. In the first place,
the bogus Freetraders of this little squad assume
airs of superiority as persons who possess the only
genuine fiscal gospel, and their pity for the be-
nighted Protectionist is large and obvious. If
they had shown their belief in their own professed
creed by putting it resolutely and honestly to the
test when they held a big majority in the old
N.S.W. Parliament, this attitude would inspire
respect; but for those Freetraders who surrepti-
tiously protected the State’s biggest industries,
and yet pose loftily in the presence of fiscal
opponents who at least live up to their creed,
there is nothing save contempt. Again, statis-
tics not only prove that N.S.W. has progressed
far more rapidly under the Commonwealth’s
openly Protectionist tariff than it did under its
old semi - Freetrade - surreptitious - Protectionist
system, but that it has also made better progress
under the openly and honestly Protectionist tariff
of the Commonwealth than any other State has
done. Therefore the whine of the Senator Walker
party about the great sacrifices it made in giving
up the Freetrade it never possessed, and, if its
actions count for anything, never really wanted to
possess, is a cause of disgust. Lastly, the attitude
of certain alleged Freetrade members and certain
alleged Freetrade papers excites still more disgust.
When the matter in question is Protection for an
industry in another State, William Wilks is a
Freetrader with an all-round dislike to Protection.
When it is a question of Protection for an
industry in his own electorate, the attitude
of William Wilks is expressed in the
words: “I am a Freeetrader, but if there
must be this nefarious Protection I demand a
share of it for my own constituents.” Therefore
by being an alleged Freetrader, the Wilks per-
son is able to vote for Protection for his own con-
stituents and no Protection for everybody else’s
constituents, and at the same time to wear an
aspect of great mental sorrow for all people who
believe in Protection. In the same way, the
S. M. Herald and Sydney Telegraph feel quali-
fied to (1) denounce Protection generally as a
curse and as the creed of persons of deficient in-
tellect ; (2) oppose Protection when it applies to
the industries of other States ; (3) demand Pro-
tection for the N.S.W. iron industry ; (4) declare
that it is only the jealousy of other States which
prevents the N.S.W. iron industry getting Pro-
tection ; and (5) describe Protection in general as
a conspiracy to benefit at the public expense “a
few tinpot Melbourne manufacturers.”
* * * *
N.S.W. still elects, through habit, certain
Freetraders, of whom Senator Walker is one.
But if it was awakened by the staggering news
that it would get real, all-round honest Freetrade
if it selected Senator Walker and his colleagues
again, and if it was explained to N.S.W. what
complete Freetrade means, it is safe to bet that
it would get six new Senators right away. And
if Senator Walker and his five colleagues had to
vote either for High Protection or complete Free-
trade—not only for absolute Freetrade at the
Customs but for the abolition of all the surrepti-
tious aids, bonuses and preferences which used to
take the place of honest Protection in N.S.W. —
with a knowledge that they would get the real
Freetrade they voted for, this paper is prepared
to bet a trifle that they would vote for High Pro-
tection. Real Freetrade, nowadays, is only a
pose, a lofty mental attitude, and an old habit—
the same as the habit of believing in Jonah and
his marine animal.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Mean Colonial Party and its Craving
for a Mean Australian Capital.
Mr. J. M. Purves (Messrs. Batt, Rodd and Purves)
said : “I am really very glad of the result of this ballot,
because I think, of all the positions that were voted on,
Yass-Oanberra is the fairest for all parties concerned—
i.e., it ought to suit everybody. I do not personally
know the exact locality’ very well, but I understand that
it is very good country, and, if the water question can be
properly dealt with, the place, it seems to me, is
very suitable. The climate, I know, is all that can
be desired, and there are other advantages; but
the Federal capital, wherever it may be, will never
be more than a country town of any’ extent. The set-
tling of the people who have to live there, and those who
will live upon them, will, of course, lead to a certain
amount of added cultivation in and around the township ;
but unless thev strike gold or some other mineral wealth
the town can never be of any importance. For instance,
look at Washington—it is dead to the world when the
American Parliament is not in session. When I was there
there was only’ one street of shops, and it consisted chiefly
of boarding-houses and a few private residences.”—
Interview (a fair sample of a large number ) in Sydney
Telegraph.
When the House of Representatives nominated
the Yass site, by the dirty and undrinkable
Murrumbidgee, for the Australian capital, the
Sydney morning papers—which are anti-Aus-
tralian all the time—at once set out to interview
the pallid bagmen who sit in offices, as to the
suitability of the arrangement. And these
natural empire-builders mostly approved. Proba-
bly the one quoted above was the most character-
istic of the lot. He voiced to perfection the un-
patriotic and anti-Australian craving of the
dealers and traders who sit in offices for a
mean capital, and their unpatriotic anti-Austra-
lian craving to assure the people of this country
that they are a poor lot Who Can’t Do Things.
The capital of Australia, according to the person
quoted above, “will never be more than a country
town”; also “unless they strike gold or some
other mineral wealth the town can never be of any
importance.” True, other countries have grown
great inland cities, even if their people didn’t
strike gold. Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Birmingham,


Huddersfield, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham,
Salford, Breslau, Brussels, Buda-Pesth, Chicago,
Dresden, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Prague, Flor-
ence, Turin, Denver, Omaha, Damascus, Teheran,
Irkutsk, Warsaw, Madrid, and a few dozen more,
are all great —some of them very great —far in-
land cities which have grown without any
adjacent gold discoveries to prop them up.
Even Washington, which the amazing Purvks
describes as “only one street of shops” and
“chiefly boarding-houses and a few private resi-
dences,” is a city of well over 300,000 population,
and it is growing so fast that it bids fair to leave
Sydney behind ere very long. But, though other
nations can raise great and noble inland capitals,
the Mean Colonial party assures Australia
that it must not think of doing anything
of the kind. Its people, according to the
Mean Colonial party, are a poor crowd who can’t do
as other communities do; therefore, they must
be content with a mean capital, and the only city
in all the world which is the political centre of a
whole continent is to “never be more than a
country town,” and “ never be of any import-
ance.” And already the crowd which secured
the partial and temporary selection of the
Yass site is explaining how the conspiracy to
make the Australian city poor and mean is to be
carried out; and talks about limiting its com-
munication with the outer world to, at most, a
right of way for a railway to Jervis Bay and
the use of “a proportion of the sea front-
age” there. The curse of Australia is this
Mean Colonial spirit—the spirit which up-
holds the States always against Australia,
and regards Australia as an enemy ; which
calls eternally for imported goods as against Aus-
tralian products; which perpetually assures the
Australian people that they are a poor, wretched
lot and Can’t Do Things ; which thinks a sort of
dog kennel is good enough for the capital of Aus-
tralia because it is only Australia, the Place That
Doesn’t Matter. And of that spirit the Sydney
Telegraph is the prophet, and the people it is
so fond of interviewing at a crisis are the apt
disciples.
Federal Politics.
The “ Opposition ” in the Australian Parliament
has elected during the month to do its washing
in public. The state of its linen was not edifying.
It seems that there is a small Reid following, a
very small one, which is tormented by a doubt as
to whether it should not abandon Mr. Reid, who
will not attend to the work of leadership, and
follow Mr. Cook, who works with great energy,
but with so little wisdom that he could never
lead a party to victory. Then there is a Knox
section, which is suspected of having at least
one follower; a Forrest section, with one fol-
lower ; an Iceberg Irvine section, which so far
does not seem to have attracted a single Polar
bear to its frozen hummocks; a section which
is Wilks, and wants to make its Balmain seat
secure by becoming a Protectionist or a Laborite ;
and other sections too nebulous to mention.
Parliament, therefore, resolves itself into these
elements : a Government which has a policy but
no electoral organisation, and which consequently
will, at the next elections, be probably left
without a party; a Labor party which has a
policy and an organisation, and which clearly holds
a mortgage on the future if the organisation does
not get too strong for the party, and, by bolting
from the shafts, upset the whole show ; an Oppo-
sition which has no policy and no organisation,
but ha.s Reid and other incubi. The prospects are
not bright for the Opposition. It wants more than
a leader; it wants also a policy ; and then its only
chance would seem to be from a break-up in the
Labor Party, a break-up of which there is a small
threat on the horizon now. As for the Govern-
ment after next elections, it will probably not
count, presuming that it follows its present course
of allowing its case to go by default.
♦
“Not Guilty’’-Then Who Is?
After a trial extending.over 13 days, the jury last
Friday decided that the drivers of the Bendigo
express which crashed into the Ballarat train at
Sunshine station last Easter Monday night, and
killed two score persons, besides injuring many
others, were not guilty of the manslaughter with
which they were charged. Except for counsel’s
addresses and the Judge’s summing up, the whole
of those days were occupied by the Grown wit-
nesses in giving their evidence —the accused,
beyond theirpleaof “not guilty” and their reports
to the Department, made no statement what-
ever—and on that evidence the jury acquitted
them. The stationmaster, Kendall, has yet
to be tried. But whether he be acquitted or not
makes little difference in fixing the responsibility
between the drivers and the Department; for the
error in signalling which he has admitted was not
pleaded by the drivers as palliation or excuse.
The jury, of course, gave no reasons, but it is
obvious that it must have accepted the drivers’
reasons why the collision occurred, viz., that the
brakes, after being applied, “came off” spon-
taneously, and when applied “at emergency”
failed to hold the train. In support of
this plea they had the evidence of Crown
witnesses —of the Westinghouse brake inspector,
that the excessive piston travel in some
instances would cause the brake application to be
light; of Professor Kernot, that the brake gene-
rally was “a feeble one, and by no means per-
fect” ; of expert Bagley, that, “had he been
train-examiner, he would by no means have
allowed the train to go out, and that, had the
rear carriages of the Ballarat train been new
instead of old ones, the collision would have been
much less disastrous”; and of many other witnesses,
that the practice in the Department is for drivers
to go past “ distance ” signals, though against
them, at a high rate of speed, and to rely on the
brakes to pull them up at the “home” sig-
nal ; also, that the train was behind time
(through the fool-practice of running long
trains that have to be pulled up twice at each
stopping-place), and that the Department expects
drivers to make up such lost time. From the
evidence —all of it the Crown’s evidence—and the
jury’s verdict thereon, the only conclusion
deducible is that the twelve, after carefully
balancing pros and cons for 4J hours, decided that
the masters, not the servants, were culpable;
that, in fact, the Department’s practice of re-
quiring men to do more work than they were
able, of expecting them to take risks, and of
supplying them with machinery incapable of
coping with those risks, was responsible for
the awful holocaust of Easter Monday. As to
what the next step will be no man can say,
though there is a loud suspicion that the under-
taker will be hastily requisitioned and the whole
matter buried with the victims —except the bill.
But, lest there be another Sunshine disaster
presently, it would be well for Victorians to recol-
lect that Adolphus Bent has already appointed
three commissioners, Justice Cussen being chair-
man, to inquire into the whole question of Vic-
torian railway management, with , special refer-
ence to the late smash, and, having recollected
that, it must be for Victorians to insist that the
pall shall not be drawn over the corpse until
someone has set forth exactly why and where-
fore the corpse occurred.
The Victorian Land Valuation Swindle.
Ip it were not that the Victorian country land-
lords are nearly always cadging from the Govern-
ment, it might have been regarded as a remark-
able coincidence that, on the very day the country
M’s.L.A. were compelling Bent to crawl down
and withdraw his Land Valuation Bill, other
representatives of the same faction were besieging
the Works Department for public money to make
and maintain their roads and bridges. In the
morning they were begging for doles to do need-
ful works ; in the afternoon they were denouncing
a measure the object of which was to ensure a
larger revenue to all shires, by an honest
valuation of country lands and properties.
The obvious fact was that the country landlords
do not want any such valuation. They don’t want
honesty ; they want charity. And in the struggle
to get it, eight shires were represented through
their members on this special occasion. Every
one of these eight got a grant from the Endow-
ment Fund in 1906 (the latest returns available),
and most of them got, in addition, a special grant.
Only three out of the eight rated themselves at
Is. 6d. in the £ ; the other five let themselves off
at Is. This is bad enough, but the outrageously
low valuations which form the basis of the rate
are even worse. Take the first shire on the
list—Avoca. Its total capital valuation is
given in the municipal statistics as £307.040.
There are 900 houses in it; estimate them
at £250 each homestead, and we get £225,000.
Deducting this amount from the total valuation,
there remains £82,040 as the value of the bare
land. As there are 289,920 acres in the shire,
that gives ss. Bd. per acre as the value at which
the land is rated. On account of that absurd
valuation the revenue from rates was only £1595.
Even upon this shameful valuation, if the same
rate had been struck (2s. 4d. in the pound) as the
working men of Brunswick and Footscray have to
pay, Avoca’s revenue from rates would have
amounted to £3722, or. an increase of more than
£2OOO per annum. Instead, however, of collect-
ing that amount, or any part of it, these land-
owners’ representatives, finding money needed to
make and mend their roads, go cadging to the
Government for public funds —funds which the
men of Colling wood and Footscray have to pro-
vide, though for their own local purposes these
men have already had to pay 2s. 4d. in the £.
Nor does Avoea stand alone in this brazen
effrontery; this list deals with the whole eight:—

deducted from the total area on account of State
lands. After making that deduction, divide the
figures in the last column by those in the first, and
the answer shows the disgraceful valuation per
acre upon which the present shire taxation is
levied. This next table makes that small effort
in arithmetic; also it shows what rates would
have been received if the Brunswick and Foot-
scray rates (2s. 4d. in the £) were collected even
upon the disgracefully low and dishonest valua-
tion now in force:—

If the land were valued on an honest basis it
would not, however, be necessary to collect any-
thing like 2s. 4d. in the £, even though Brunswick
and Footscray do have to pay that rate —the same
Brunswick and Footscray to which subsequently
the rich country landlords come for charity. The
most outrageous case is that of the wealthy Western
shire of Colac. Here a large proportion of the
land is worth from £2O to £5O per acre. Reckon-
ing the average as £l2 (which is almost for certain
a serious under-estimate), then the total real value
would be £8,964,420. Deduct £562,500 for dwell-
ings (2250 at £250), and £8,401,920 remains as the
value of the land; and a 2s. 4d.-in-the-£ rate
would mean over £50,000, which is what these
rich Colac landlords would pay if they realised
their professed desire for all to be treated
alike, and if they consequently paid on
the basis on which Footscray and Brunswick
pay. By persistent and shameless rapacity
this rich shire of Colac has from first
to last obtained from the general taxpayer some-
thing like £250,000; and, in order to get that
spoliation of the Treasury continued, the one hope
of the rich landlords is to prevent an honest valu-
ation. If that were made, the robbery would be
so plain that it would be difficult to carry it
through. So Bent was squeezed, squeezed hard,
and Bent did just what on his record one might
expect that he would do. But the crying need to
stop this shameless robbery remains.
Bent—the Vicar of Bray.
In Thomas Bent’s recent abandonment of a
Ministerial Bill, on which he had professed to
stake his Government’s existence, it is more than
possible to perceive the working of a passion
stronger even than Bent’s love of office ; and that
is the man’s fear of the aspersions that would in-
evitably follow if office were torn from him. The
threatened defeat of the Land Valuation Bill was
Bent’s chance—the chance of his life —to pose as
boss Victorian patriot and reformer of the coun-
try’s obstructive land laws. It gave him
an opportunity to corner the Labor Party, to-
gether with every other party in the Victorian
Legislative Assembly which claims to be Liberal.
It put him in the position to reverse his old
evil reputation for Conservatism, and, had his
administration been satisfactory, it must have
resulted in his restoration to office in the
near future. But that, it seems almost certain,
was where Bent’s doubts came in. The man
clearly seemed afraid to lose his control of affairs
for even a month. As leader of the Opposition
he would sit to be pelted with proofs, and crushed
with revelations. Victoria thinks it knows its
Bent. . As a matter of fact, his worst features
are unsuspected by three-fourths of the voters, and
actually known to only a few of the more
enlightened. Bent is not a Conservative on prin-
ciple—or what is called principle in political life.
Assured of a majority for the Land Valuation
Bill, he would have passed it. There is probably
no Radical measure that he would not pass to keep
himself from being completely exposed. But his
dread of getting shifted makes him the tool of the
Assembly that tolerates him, and for his short-
comings in most needed legislation, not Bent, but
the other fellows, must be blamed. They have
always at hand a bad means to good ends. Bent is
the available bad means. If a majority in
the House had good ends in view they could
attain them through the Premier—the haunted
bluffer whose air of burly disregard for what
people and newspapers say of him is only a cloak.
In this Victorian Assembly it is not the dog that
wags the tail, but the tail that wags the dog.
Every member with a paltry local purpose to
serve compels Bent to serve it. He is the Tom of
all parties, and on condition that he pleases them
they continue to give him carte blanche to please
himself in those little matters which place him at
their mercy. The man in the street remarks
philosophically that Bent is bound to be thrown
out at next election —as though he were nowadays
a stumbling-block in the way of progress. It is
the House that is the obstruction ; for he would
be prepared to march in the van of progress if the
Parliament gave the word of command. He is
merely a political Vicar of Bray, caring not at
all about professions of faith, if by recantations
he can preserve himself in the vicarage. And the
shame attaches to the House that listens to him
with its tongue in its cheek —of the flock that
calls him shepherd.
♦
Tlie Commonwealth and Immigration,
A howl has lately been raised against the idea that
the Commonwealth should have anything todo with
the introduction of immigrants. Now, one or two
things ought to be clear enough even to the obfus-
cated intellect of a State Frighter. First, immi-
gration is a necessity for developmental purposes
—to bring land under cultivation and to build up
manufactures. An intelligent immigration system
might in 10 years do work which would take a
century if the country had to wait for a home-
grown population. But far and away above the
developmental aspect stands the question of
defence. Australia wants a ready-made popula-
tion to provide it with means of maintaining this
country for the white man. Beside the question
of defence, all others are small; and were it not
for the threat of Asia, the immigration question
might well be left over for later consideration.
Probably Wade and Bent themselves would
admit that the pressing necessity for population
here is to ensure that the shores are protected ;
and, if they were honest enough to answer, it would
be as well to ask them in what part of Australia
defence (and therefore the immigrant) is most
needed. Surely even they would not dare to deny
that a million men in the Northern Territory
would be a better protection for Australia
than many more than a million congested in
the south-eastern corner of the country. For
purposes of defence Australia wants population
in every portion; but particularly it wants
population in those spots where to-day BINGHI
is the sole representative of the man on
the land. While New South Wales and
Victoria could well do with the right class of im-
migrants, the politician who would send them to
those States, when he could just as easily distri-
bute them in the North, would have all his
ingenuity taxed to show that he was not a traitor
to his country, and a silly person who might one
day be pulling a rickshaw with a brown gentle-
man lolling in its plush cushion. And the only
power by which the North can be populated is the
Australian Government. The Commonwealth is
the only friend the North has, and if the North
remains unfilled, it threatens to be only a matter of
a little time when there will be neither east, nor
south, nor west for the white man. So the whole
matter of immigration should be in the hands of
the Commonwealth ; and while readily accepting
suitable immigrants for any part of Australia, the
Commonwealth should deliberately and systemati-
cally neglect the whole of the settled portions—
and especially New South Wales and Victoria—in
favor of filling the places which now appear on the
map as flat white blanks.

Where Anti-Sosli Spells Lunacy.
In anticipation of the coming Federal elections,
an anti-Socialist “organiser” has just started a
tour of the big N.S.W. towns. He is the same
old organiser who toured on behalf of anti-Sosh
three years ago, and did no perceptible good to
the cause. His mission is to tell once more of the
horrors of Socialism, of the Blight that will
descend on the district that consorts with Labor,
and of the prosperity and joyousness which are
bound to arrive if things are allowed to lag in the
old rut. In every big centre there are some people
ready to listen to “organisers,” however crazy their
propaganda may be. So, even in the deadest of
districts, the barracker for more deadness gets a
following. It is a phenomenon, as surpising as it
is depressing, that in many of the big towns the
people whom the anti-Sosh organiser attracts are
not the village idiot and the local landlords exclu-
sively, but a fair proportion of shopkeepers and
business men as well. It is pathetic in places such
as Picton, Bathurst and the like to see small
traders adding their cheers to those of
wealthy land monopolists when the hired orator
from Sydney denounces “ the criminal folly of a
progressive Land Tax.” Many of these calamit-
ous asses have been bred and born in the town
that the organiser is paid to dissuade from approv-
ing of a land tax. From their childhood they have
been watching it dwindle in prosperity and popu-
lation. They have on the tips of their tongues the
names of once-prosperous fellow-citizens who
filed their schedules or were sold up by the bank
after strenuous efforts to combat the deadness of
things. In their mind’s eye they can see, even as
they express their approval of further stagnation,
the “To Let” sign in the shop windows.
They know why their town, and in con-
sequence, their own business is wilting.
It is because the ring fence of big estates forbids
expansion, and bans settlement. They are there
to do business, but in the town there is a con-
stantly decreasing tally of people to do business
with, and outside the town the population remains
stationary. One man holds the broad, rich acres
that should be supporting three or four hundred
families, and the odds are he imports everything
but his monthly hair-cut from Sydney. If there
is any unit of this community who should grasp
the need for a progressive land tax it is the up-
country tradesman. It is the only possible hope
a good many of him has of keeping his head
above the financial waters. Yet each Federal
election finds him barracking for Anti-Sosh ; and
the peripatetic “organiser” on behalf of that
foolish and negative creed is rushed by him in
droves. The social side of the question is a big:
factor in this tragic state of affairs. The back-
blocks trader, like the city clerk, suffers from a-
hankering to be on what his women folk regard as
the “ respectable ” side of the political fence
wherefore a whole host of citizens are insanely
willing to see their own prosperity slowly
strangled to death for the joy of voting the same-
ticket as the adjacent “Squire.”
B. Smith’s Friends Tried in a New Role.
The wrecked Aeon’s officers and passengers, who
spent a few solitary weeks on Christmas Island,
were landed in Sydney by the Manuka last week,
and promptly yarns got into the papers glossing
over the conduct of the Chinese crew. They
didn’t rush the boats, it was intimated—and the
fact that it is necessary to mention such a thing is
in itself a fairly stiff indictment of Chinese crews.
It was quite true that these Chinese didn’t rush
the boats. But there was no reason why
they should have rushed the boats. There was
nothing to create panic. The vessel went on
the reef without a bump; it did the nasty trick
so softly that it might have been a roll of velvet
it had landed on top of. There was no sea, no
storm, no rushing in of water, the engines and
lights were kept going, and land was not more
than 200 yards away. Even the engineers had to
be told what had happened. That the Chinese
crew abstained from rushing the boats wasn’t
therefore anything to the men’s credit. Neither, for
that matter, was the way they got the boats into
the water, later on. So disorganised were they,
and so little did they know about the business
that, even with the perfect conditions prevailing,
passengers were more alarmed about the way the
Chinese were shaping when getting the boats out
than about anything else. Had there been panic,
it is pretty certain those boats would never
have been launched. And afterwards, on
shore, these good, reliable, docile workers simply
struck and refused to do a hand’s turn. Even the
captain admits that he was told —“No pay, no
work.” While the few white castaways were
struggling with the very tough job of repairing
and fitting out a boat to make the long journey to ,
Fanning Island, the Chinese did nothing. The
yellow carpenter did not even take his tools out
—they let the whites hammer and patch away as
best they could. Meantime they did a little in
the way of pillaging. One passenger, going in for
a swim at night, had his belt and his money
stolen; the belt was found later on ripped up.
So truculent were the Chinese crew that for a-
fortnight the whites had to take turns on watch—
for the Chinese had revolvers and knives, and had
swung them menacingly. Ah Sin has been
tried under a good many circumstances, and
proved most unwholesome and unsatisfactory.
Now he has been tried as the companion-
A Matter of Degree.
The Minister of Defence: To confound the Defence
Scheme with the European idea of conscription which
takes a man away from his social responsibilities and his
work, places him under military discipline, and drills him
into what might be called a fighting machine, is entirely
a mistake.
Mr. Bruce Smith (N'.S.'VV.): It is a matter of degree.
The Minister of Defence : Everything is a matter of
degree—and facts. —Parliamentary Report.
B. Smith would most undoubtedly be very, very
cross
If some rude person called him Jap, and yet, I’m
at a loss
To see how he could argue otherwise in that re-
spect :
A Jap is human—or a rumor’s rife to that effect.
And he talks and argues much the same as B.
So, if Smith is not a twin
To his cherished Yellow-skin,
Why it’s only just a matter of degree,
Just a trifling little matter of degree.
Now, a Jap is not a monkey, though he’s oft com-
pared with such,
And he doesn’t look unlike one, so it hardly
matters much.
A monkey has a fearsome phiz, and hands that
grab at things,
And he imitates his betters —all of which the
matter brings
To a very clear conclusion, seems to me,
Which you cannot fairly funk :
If a Jap is not a monk-
Ey, it’s patently a matter of degree.
And we needn’t mind a matter of degree.
Of native monkeys hereabout, of course, you
haven’t heard;
And a monkey’s not a native bear, which, clearly,
is absurd,
And yet, a bear clings to a tree with young bears
on its back
(My word ! we’re getting on a rather interesting
tack) —
Yes, it clings there like the cheerful chimpanzee.
So, if monkeys are not bears
Quite exactly—well, who cares?
When it’s nothing but a matter of degree.
You can hardly notice matters of degree !
Well, bears are very plainly never bunyips, at
first glance;
But wait a bit and give Smith’s reasoning a
sporting chance.
They are both Australian, purely ; there is no
denying that;
And they both live in the bush, so there you have
it, clear and pat.
And “bear” and “bunyip” both begin with “b.”
So, it’s clearly in the game
That if these are not the same—
Well,‘who’d quarrel with a matter of degree?
We ignore these little matters of degree.
I suppose ’twill be admitted that a bunyip is a
myth.
Without adopting arguments resorted to by
Smith ?
But we’ve never seen a bunyip, and the myths are
pretty rare;
So there seems to be a solid sort of fam’ly likeness
there.
And it’s pretty safe to reason, seems to me,
If a bunyip and a sprite
Aren’t about an equal height,
Well, at most, it’s but a matter of degree,
Just a simple little matter of degree.
So, overlooking certain petty matters of degree,
We are forced to these conclusions with undoubted
certaintee :
B. Smith’s a Jap, a Jap’s an ape (according unto
Smith),
An ape’s a bear, a bear’s a bunyip, and the last’s
a myth !
It’s as clear as any argument can be—
That if our dear friend Smith
Is not a simple myth
It’s an unimportant matter of degree,
Quite a microscopic matter of degree.

The suggestion that King Edward should
choose a Capital site is, on the ground that one
wise counsellor is better than a multitude of
foolish ones, worthy of consideration. Better,
however, for the foolish ones to seek enough
Wisdom'from D.C.L. Whisky to enable them to
settle the question on its merits. On its merits
D.C.L. is everywhere recognised as the best in-
surer of Wisdom and the best counsellor of the
of white people cast away on a desert
island, and he has come out of that test
just as badly as out of any of the others. Fortu-
nately, the rescue was effected while there was
still plenty of food and no visible danger of
running short; otherwise, judging by Ah Sin’s
attitude when there wasn’t any danger, those who
remained of the Aeon’s castaways would have an
even more shocking opinion of Chinese as com-
panions on a desert island than they have now.

Year after year, at about this time, the Mel-
bourne daily papers scratch away at the Dust
Nuisance without indicating the true reason
why there is such a horrible abundance of dust to
kick up. The Age is the chief offender. That
misguided journal has some foolish theories con-
cerning dust, and some of its stupidest readers
encourage it to publish “admirable articles” on
the subject. All the Melbourne dust that the
Age dreams of is the product of metropolitan
roads; therefore nothing more is required to
abate the nuisance than a new method of road
making. If all streets and byways were coated
with kerosene mixture, or salad dressing, or
something, the dust would rise no more, and
then His Excellency the G.-G. might drive from
Government House to the Town Hall and
back without needing to be carefully washed
and brushed on his return. This wearisome Age
theory is persistently advanced in face of the
clouds of new dust that come sweeping into the
city from the neglected suburbs, and into the
neglected suburbs from the surrounding country,
every time a wind blows free. Melbourne was a
less grimy city than now when, in the old days,
its malodorous open drains traversed the main
thoroughfares. The broad flow of water took in a
lot of superfluous matter and removed it.
Obviously Melbourne is dustier nowadays because
insufficient labor is employed in dealing with the
deposits which formerly drained away “on their
own.” The present system of hosing the gutters
occasionally whilst the dust remains outside them
is the merest trifling with what is really a very
serious trouble.

There is one Sydney court that the reporters on
the Evening Bloodstain never invade ; and, even
if the magistrate simply bubbles over with wit,
all the scintillations have to go unrecorded. This
is the “ Children’s Court,” founded a couple of
years ago, after South Australia had tried the ex-
periment and proved it good. It is a busy court,
too, with an average of well over 30 cases a week.
To this court the police are bound to take all
arrested offenders, under 16 years old; and
there, with no limelight, but with, at the
most, two or three elderly constables, and the
matrons of half-a-dozen shelters and reformatories,
the desperado of 13 finds it tremendously hard work
to maintain his pose as a fierce and hardened
sinner. Into this court the “neglecteds” and the
“ uncontrollables ” are swept up ; but, contrary
to a pretty general belief, they don’t form the
majority—don’t even form one-fifth of the total.
It’s a painful fact, but a fact nevertheless, that in
the past 12 months no less than 63 youngsters of
under 16 were up at this court charged with bur-
glary ; in fact, 40 of them were under 14 —includ-
ing three girls. The biggest section, however, are
just plain young • sneak-thieves, though 34 began
early in life in the “business” side of crime by
setting up as “ receivers of stolen property.” On
the whole, the experience one gets in the Children’s
Court is horribly depressing; yet the court
patently works on the right lines. First and
foremost, the youngster hasn’t got the least chance
of posing as a hero ; he gets no advt., no limelight,
no anything of the sort. He just falls into the
hands of people who make a special study of
reforming wild children, and who, moreover,
mostly have the merit of being able to hold their
tongues about it when a youngster has made a slip.

The visit of Uncle Sam’s battleships moved
London Morning Post to speak a vigorous word
for the coming Australian navy :
Australians are not likely to be deterred from embark-
ing- on this enterprise by the spectacle of what has been
achieved by the American people, who, at the time when
the colonies were first federated, numbered only about
the same as the Australian people to-day. The most for-
midable opposition hitherto confronting Mr. Deakin has
been, not hostility or apathy in Australia, butthe dogged
obstruction of the Admiralty in London, who cannot see
why, if French colonies subsidise the French navy with
cash, Australia and Canada should not subsidise the Eng-
lish navy. Observing that some of the smaller British
colonies accept the principle of cash subsidies, the Ad-
miralty apparently consider that the others may reason-
ably be expected to do the same. In other words, they
fail to understand that, given a certain set of circum-
stances, colonies grow into nations, and that the national
point of view is essentially different from the colonial.
For twelve months past Mr. Deakin has been trying to
obtain the co-operation of the Admiralty in working out
a scheme which, while laying the foundations of an Aus-
tralian navy under Commonwealth control, would ensure
a homogeneity of ships and training so as to promote
efficiency in a fighting alliance. Continued obstruction
on the part of the Admiralty can only mean, in the long
run, that the Australian navy will grow up on a smaller
scale and in a less efficient form than if hearty encourage-
ment had been offered from this end. No greater disserv-
ice could be rendered by any State department here,
either to the United Kingdom or to the Empire, than
to delay or prevent the beginnings of an Imperial naval
alliance, which alone can ultimately secure to the Em-
pire, including this country, a perpetual command of the
sea. All history shows that navies must be grown from seed,
and the seed is not prohibitively expensive. Mr. Deakin’s
proposals—which seem to involve within a year or two
an annual expenditure of about half-a-milhon sterling—
are proposals for preparing and planting the seed, with
the expert assistance of the Admiralty, in order that later
generation may enjoy a fruit not otherwise obtainable
at any price. But behind the reluctance of the Admiralty
there lurks undoubtedly the political apprehension that
a squadron owned, manned, and controlled by Australia
could not be relied upon implicitly to support the foreign
policy of the United Kingdom in all emergencies. This
political objection is, however, a matter for statesmen, not
for naval experts, the proper relation between the two
classes being that the statesmen provide the political
hypothesis upon which the naval experts have to base
their technical work. If English Cabinet Ministers dic-
tate, as they ought, the hypothesis of Imperial alliance—
not colonial dependence—the problem for the naval
experts is not how to secure one navy under one control
in time of peace, but how to promote the utmost efficiency
of allied navies.

Urged by the Vic. Water Commissioners,
Minister Swinburne is alleged to be delving
deeply into his inner consciousness to find means
to compel landowners in irrigated areas to use the
fluid that the State has brought to their doors,
instead of sitting down and calmly waiting for
land values to rise. Yet time and time again
these simple ways of compelling the land-
owner to use his soil and the water have
been pointed out : (1) the levying of a general
rate on the area irrigated, whether the
water is used or not; (2) the imposition of a
land tax so that the owner must either use his
land or get rid of it; (3) the enforcement of
honest valuations and adequate local rates, so that
it won’t pay the owner to await the unearned
increment while he cadges subsidies from the
State to keep roads, etc., in repair. But Swin-
burne can’t adopt those plans without treading
on some loafing landlord’s toes; wherefore he
professes to have a brand-new problem set before
him, and he writhes in the agony of deep thought
and struggles hard to give the impression that he
is doing his best, and may hatch something tre-
mendous some day.

“C. N. Macintosh,” from Buenos Aires, S.
America:—
One hears a lot about the British mercantile marine.
Most Britons, when they hear or mention it, throw out
their chests and fancy they are speaking of ships manned
by men born in the British Isles. One needs to live out
here and watch, the steamers that sail under the British
flag to realise what the term really does mean. Out in
Australia, with your laws regulating colored crews, you
do not get a chance to see the full drift of things.
Under three years ago a large meat-carrying contract
was secured by the Anglo-Argentine Shipping Co. The
ships commenced to run with a great flourish of trum-
pets—all British,” vwis the word. On their first trip
they had everything-*fp to the knocker. Each carried a
British skipper, four British officers, a crew of 45
Britishers, and a bugler. Every man did the deck in
swagger uniform, while the “ style ” almost led one to
believe that this line was half-brother to his Majesty’s
navy. On their second trip the steamers still carried the
style, and the white British crew, but one officer less.
On their third visit the bugle boy had gone ; likewise the
swagger uniforms and half the “dog”; the crew of 45
had been reduced to 30, but still all were white Britishers.
On the fourth visit the captain was a “ white Britisher,”
and two of his officers likewise; but the crew was de-
cidedly mixed. Next visit, the British flag flew, as
before, but it waved over a British captain, two white
British officers, one foreigner, andsoyellow “Britishers”
from Hong Kong. What their next round of visits may
bring forth Heaven only knows ; but I am prepared for
anything.
That is a sample of the results of “a fair field and no
favor ” (or Freetrade as some call it), when up against
State subsidies and State bounties. Is it any wonder
that the Argentines (or people of any other nationality)
smile when they see the British flag waving over 15 or 20
Britishers and 50 Chinese, and then read the bombast
that one sees in the English papers !
“ England rules the waves.” She may think she does ;
but every day she is training more men for the Yellow
Men’s Navy, while the home-born Britisher finds the con-
ditions so uncongenial and pay so low that few men of
good type will ship. What, then, is the value of Britain’s
mercantile marine as a reserve in case of war?
Yes, it is time little Australia was learning the art of
self-defence.

The coasting steamer Hillmeads is a twin-screw
vessel, so, the other day, when one of the tail
shafts snapped, she was able to get comfortably
into port instead of bobbing helplessly about on
the high seas, as she would have had to do had she
been a single-screw boat. The remarkable
frequency with which the tail-shaft accident
happens is getting on the public’s nerves,
and people are beginning to think that
Commerce is rather too willing to put its trust in
one big steel rod, and allow the passenger to
keep dry as best he can. All the recent shaft
casualties in Australian waters have ended with-
out loss of life or serious damage to ship property,
so far as the public knows. Certainly, a few
boats have mysteriously disappeared off the face
of the waters, and it may have been a broken tail-
shaft in their case, and again it may not. Even
assuming, however, that the tail-shaft wasn’t the
criminal in these cases, it can only be regarded as
great good fortune that the accident in every
other case has occurred when the vessel has had
plenty of sea room. But some day the tail-shaft
disaster will occur when the circumstances are
less favorable, and then there'll be no ship to drag
home with a tow-line, but just a heap of crumpled
iron on a reef. When that happens, the question
of compelling all passenger vessels above a certain
tonnage to have twin screws may be taken up in
real earnest.
“ Y.” digs into the ribs of history
The threatened invasion of Scottish fishermen creates
no dismay among those who live by line or net fishing in
N.S.W. “Let ’em come,” is the common remark;
“unless they strike better conditions than ours they’ll
wish themselves back.” In a similar dismal condition of
the fishing industry in England the Government took the
matter up, and in time produced admirable results. It
associated the fishing industry with a scheme of naval
defence. The British methods of the time are, of course,
out of date now, but the connection of the humble fishing
boat and the warship was then, as it should be now,
perceived, and the fisherman was encouraged that the
navy might be benefited.
Here was how the British Government went to work.
The Privy Council in March, 1594, issued an ordinance,
“ very necessary to be placed in the houses of all men,
especially common victuallers,” instructing the English
people to eat fish. Lent was very largely observed,
and Fridays were generally fish days; but nevertheless
the consumption of fish was considered insufficient, and
Saturdays throughout the year were ordered to be fish
days. The ordinance disavowed any religious significance,
stating that its object was to develop fishing along the
coast, and thereby encourage seafaring “so that the navy
shall be replenished with men.” The Government penalty
for eating-flesh on Saturdays was ±3fine or three months’
imprisonment. Later the fine was reduced to ; but
as £1 then was equal to £5 now, the penalty was fairly
substantial. Any householder knowing and permitting
flesh to be eaten on Saturdays was fined 405., and victual-
lers and others who sold flesh on Saturdays were fined £5.
The Privy Council of that day condescended to argue,
and the first argument with which it backed up its
ordinance ran thus: “Our country is surrounded by
seas ; our best defence is the navy ; fishing is the nurse
of shipping, and if it flourishes men will be at all times
ready for service in the navy.” That argument
has a homely ring to Australian ears. The second
argument insisted on an array of villages along
the coast. “By stimulating the fishing industry,”
the Privy Council went on, “we replenish those
villages not alone with fishermen, but shipwrights,
smiths, ropemakers, sailmakers, weavers, and scores of
other craftsmen.’’ That, too, fits the Australian outlook
pretty closely. A third argument was addressed to the
small farmer class. It was pointed out that increased
consumption of fish would reduce the consumption of
flesh, and that large areas, instead of being devoted to
“ grazing beefs and muttons,” would be cut up into small
farm’s, and so the country would be studded with inland vil-
lages instead of grazing preserves. That is a fairly accurate
statement of the Australian closer settlement idea. There
followed a rage of pamphlets dealing with fishery-develop-
ment, the burden of most of them being the “ replenish-
ing of the navy”; and the outcome of the enthusiasm,
public and private, was the establishment of the fishing-
industry on a permanent and prosperous basis along the
coast of England.
The history of the navy shows that the connection
between fishing boats and men-of-war was fully as inti-
mate as the Government and private pamphleteers had
said would be the case, for, year by year, out of the fish-
ing villages and coast settlements recruits flocked to the
navy. That intimate connection is a natural one, and
in Australia should inspire all friends of naval defence to
be also friends of the local fishing industry.

One hundred and twenty or so dear creatures, from
all parts of the Commonwealth, made an early
start this week in St. James’ Hall, Sydney, to
talk about Socialism and other things they mostly
know nothing at all about. The first contribution
was a delightful essay on “Woman Under
Socialism,” in which the shocked ladies were in-
formed that under Socialism everybody would
have to put in his two or three hours a day :
Scholars, scientists, artists, and others would have to
devote a few' hours a day to assiduous physical toil, but
she would like to know how a few hours of assiduous
physical toil would affect such a person as a musician.
All of which, alas !is but too true. The railways
are a big bit of Socialism, and the post and tele-
graph office is another bit, and street cleaning is a
third fragment; and, as everybody knows, G.
Reid has to put in at least two hours out of every
24 crawling under engines and other things at
Redfern workshops, and B. Smith can be seen
any morning between nine and 11, racing along
with telegrams, and next week, if Hambourg
happened to be here, it would be his turn to
sweep up George-street between Martin-place and
King-street. With these horrors of Socialism
staring the ladies in the face, really is there need
to meet (with the help of vile.socialistic trains
and trams) to argue about their existence?

The Crossley Sydney season of six con-
certs ended with a matinee on Monday after-
noon and the singing by the star of “God Be
With You ” (till she and the audience meet again
understood). It is difficult to realise that 3200 per-
sons could make such a tumult and a shouting as
that last audience did in showingits appreciation of
the singers and players, and in demanding encores.
The season has been the unqualified success it
deserved, for the combination is the best of its
kind so far to visit Australia ; and, as for Crossley
herself, she has paid her native country the com-
pliment of coming back twice while in the prime
of her early summer-time, not waiting for the
evening calm and cool, to give us a skimmed-milk
voice. The company opens in Melbourne this
week, and later will warble its way through Ade-
laide, the West, and Maoriland, returning in
March to give Sydney more melody.

You can have your choice now. At Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) there is Carrie Moore to dis-
cuss between acts : further down the street the
other lady has just set out upon a stage career. It
is another case of yes-no ; and Sydney seems to be
the place where that sort of thing breaks out quite
naturally. Even over the Federal Capital the
House of Representatives has said Yass; and
there is no telling yet whether the Senate, which
always did like Monard, won’t say the other
thing. Still that’s wandering away from the
Merry Widow, and so far the public has shown no
sign of doing anything of the sort, for it’s still a
case of catching an early train and waiting on
the doorstep if you haven’t booked a perch before-
hand.
MISS KATHARINE GOODSON, a famous
pianiste, who appears at Sydney Town Hall
on 17th October.
“The Belle of Mayfair” continues to
walk, likewise to dance, in grace and beauty
nightly before the eyes of edified Criterion audi-
ences. Miss Ivy Salvin, late of Darlinghurst and
elsewhere, has now settled down definitely in the
more desirable quarter of Mayfair, and the change
has proved satisfactory all round. As Time is
incapable of corroding the Mayfair chorus, and as
the jokes that dwell in this part of the world are
for the most part proof against age-corrosion, the
odds are the Belle will stay at her present address
for some time to come.

After reviewing “Two Little Sailor Boys,”
at Sydney Palace, The Bulletin has doubts
about the wisdom of entrusting the defence of this
country any longer to the British navy. “Two
Little Sailor Boys ” might with more justice have
been called “The Admiral’s Imbecility,” for a
person of that rank dodders furiously through all
four acts, laying waste the emotions of the com-
pany at the bidding of a fiendish wife with a
metallic laugh and a weakness for stabbing people
in the back and throwing her offspring off bridges
into muslin and green limelight.
* * « *
The story of “ The Admiral’s Imbecility ”
doesn’t suffer from originality. It contains no
surprises, but it skips along gaily by way of
assault and battery, insult and murder, from
8 p.m. to 10.45, and is entertaining all the time.
Admiral Grey, R.N. (retired), has a grown-up
daughter and a daughter-son (later on, one of the
Two Little Sailor Boy-Girls). His household
consists of himself, his second wife (the lady with
the metallic laugh), and the daughter and son
aforesaid. The lady with the laugh owns a Past,
and, to prevent it colliding with the present and
telescoping the future, she incites her husband,
the lamentable Admiral, to bombard the
domestic arrangements. The lady’s previous
performances seem to be known to everyone but
the Admiral, and, at her bidding, he cheerfully
throws his family and friends out of doors and
casts suspicion over all. There is a good captain
in love with his daughter, and a villainous lieu-
tenant who hates the good captain and falls down
throttled immediately the good captain shakes
the front of his vest. A fearfully hoarse burglar
pervades the first three acts, and tyrannises over a
girlish waif until he is killed by being knifed in
the back by the Admiral’s amazing missus. One
Captain —of the Worcester regiment—is supposed
to have died gloriously in S’Africa after saving
the life of the Good Captain, but he turns up in
the third act in a muffled-up condition, like a new
sauce bottle hiding its label from the world. He
unwraps his identity when the proper time comes,
and pours himself over the situation like a bitter
but forgiving condiment. The action of the drama
is stopped every now and then to allow one of the
characters to bless one of the others; even
the Admiral’s wife, in the intervals between
requesting people to do their ineffective
worst and laughing the metallic laugh,
requests Providence to bless the child she
pushed into the muslin river in the first act.
Possibly the most impressive moment in the play
is in the last act, when she repairs to the house of
her dismissed maid-servant with the intention of
interviewing her step-daughter, who has taken
refuge there. The pert maid bars her way, and
says that that is a respectable house. A second
demand for admittance is met with a snappy re-
fusal and a reference to the safety of the spoons.
Only after a third attempt, and another crushing
retort, does the Admiral’s wife recoil; trembling
with rage, she demands in a deep contralto, “ Do
you mean to insult me 1 ”
■****■
Lilian Meyers glides stealthily through the
part of Mrs. Admiral in several very tine gowns ;
Mildred Grey, the Admiral’s daughter, is grace-
fully played by Lorna Forbes ; and Maud Chet-
wynd sparkles as the maid. Louise Carbasse and
Maisie Maxwell are the Sailor Boy-Girls ; Wilson
Forbes dodders as the Admiral; Conway Wing-
field is the good captain ; Arthur Cowley is the
villainous Lieutenant Redstone; and G. H.
Emery is well wrapped-up as the Worcester-sauce
captain. As an instance of how hard the play
hits the public over the heart, it may be mentioned
that, the night this paper attended, an earnest
voice from the gods loudly advised the waif to
resist the impossibly hoarse burglar to the last.
Such incidents are calculated to make the carping
critic wilt in his chair.

Sydney Tivoli programme still leans
heavily on the 12 Arabs of Abdullah, who toil at
spinning themselves. Osborn and Brooks, sketch
artists, have stepped into the place vacated by
the departed Meymotts, but otherwise the bill
bears a brotherly resemblance to that of last week.
Burt Shepard and his piano, Tod Lowen, Fanny
Powers, Irving Sayles, and the Barnards’ dolls
supply the balance of a moderately good show.
It’s about time the Tivoli meteorologist sighted a
big change approaching.

West’s Pictures are back at Sydney Glaci-

ing nightly upon a white frozen floor and a num-
ber of fair women and brave men—or, rather, ven-
turesome women and brave men —scurrying hither
and thither on murderous-looking boots, the big
hall is lighted as with a few glow-worms only,
while a packed and seated audience gazes upon a
motor race from New York to Paris. The pro-
grammed note that the race is an imaginary
one is more necessary than Edwin Geach
might think. The young farmer who has
grown up milking cows, separating milk, and
feeding poddies does not stop long enough (ac-
cording to good accounts) at his public school to
learn enough geography to know there is any con-
siderable fluid between Paris and New York.

tervals there is de Groen’s band.

At Sydney Lyceum, Harry Lauder on the
chromomegaphone is still easily first favorite,
although his rivals, P. Dawson and S. Kirby, are
steadily winning favor. The star picture of the
piece is the splendid Roman Idyll, which rages
through an emotional story in many rare colors.
Strange how the people enjoy looking at picture
representations of what they have seen in real
life : the Sydney Eight-Hours procession evoked
quite a furore of applause when it set back the
clock and brought last week into the beginning of
this ! Which probably explains why the amateur
photographer is always kept busy photoing the
babies of his friends—the babies they see every
day.

At a Smoking Competition : I took two
friends and we climbed up three flights of stairs,
passed a genial doorkeeper, and arrived at a gal-
lery filled with chairs, and men, and blue tobacco
smoke. We leant over the railing and looked
down at.the competitors—36o of them, seated in
groups of six round sixty small tables, and all smok-
ing steadily. Some of them, with the conscious-
ness of a stiff job on hand, had their coats off;
others had newspapers, into which they peered
through the fast thickening fog. But the bulk of
them sat listening to the official on the stage,
which place, seen from the spectators’ gallery,
looked like the opposite edge of a drowsy volcano.
The official, in a voice muffled by the smoke, an-
nounced “The programme of items will now be
proceeded with. The first is” , and a man in
evening-dress fought a way to the mist-enshrouded
piano and sat down. His selection was a “rag-
time,” and the notes, as they fled out of the in-
strument, lost themselves in the haze. Presently
the pianist finished, and another entertainer
advanced to the crater’s edge and started to tell
humorous stories. By this time, 360 pipes going
steadily had dyed the atmosphere a beautiful blue,
and you felt you would like to carve out a block of
it, take it outside, and watch it melt. Close to
the walls, where it wasn’t quite solid, sinuous
wisps rose lazily until gripped by the draught
from one of the windows, when they streamed up
and out into the night to have a look at the stars
and tantalise the angels on duty. The evening
didn’t wear away—it just thickened. Somewhere
about 10.15, when the atmosphere was lying in
flat, blue flakes, and most of the pipes were cold
and empty, the newly-discovered long-distance
champion mounted the stage and took his last few
lingering whiffs. He managed to keep going long
enough to smash the German record, and then,
having had a long smoke for nothing, won £lO,

and shed a lustre on his country, he relinquished
his “gun.” As a new form of athletics, the
“ smoking competition ” should appeal to the man
of profound thought and few words who sits
smoking for hours in the corner of the humble
hostelry alongside half a glass of ale.

A slightly altered version of “Camille,’
with Miss Anglin as the heroine, gives that
accomplished artiste a chance to emotionalise
with unusual vehemence, but is not otherwise a
specially interesting revival. Nor is it likely to
jarove so attractive as “ The Taming of the
Shrew,” which was removed to make room for it.
When the performance at Her Majesty’s (Melb.)
had been prolonged to 11.30 p.m. on Saturday
by a succession of tedious Waits, the audience went
away remarking that they were about full up of
Camille and her troubles. Miss Anglin, to be
sure, plays the part naturally as far as her appear-
ance can be reconciled with the text, and if she
were to take a dose of poison in the last act
her decease would seem reasonable. But the
theory of a fatal consumption in her case
needs something more than an occasional short
cough to commend it to public acceptance. Rising
from her death-bed to enfold the belated Armand
in a mad embrace, Camille is palpably plump and
hearty, and when she at last lapses into silence,
one feels that the lady is not dead, but dozing.
This air of robustness negatives much of the effect
of Miss Anglin’s performance from first to
last; and, even if she looked the part, she
couldn’t make it quite congenial to her, for
the French demi-mondaine is idealised by
the author, and even Sarah Bernhardt, who
appears to play Camille “ naturally,” de-
corates the character with histrionic graces that
are foreign to the uncompromising realism of Miss
Anglin’s style. She makes her strongest appeal
to sympathy in her scene with Duval, senr,, pre-
sented by Titheraclge as a hard-shelled English
parent of Wesleyan tendencies—kindly but frosty.
Yet. here, as elsewhere, her references to her
health are unconvincing.
• • « *
Prom the Armand of her devotion Miss
Anglin gets insufficient inducement to mawkish
sentimentality. Henry Kolker is everything that
Kyrle Bellew wasn’t, and, in the hysterical love-
sick capacity of Armand Duval, nobody can have
been more acceptable than Bellew was. Not
that Harcourt Beatty is an Armand to be
sneezed at. Kolker’s effusive insincerity in-
vites many sneezes. He is broadly Ameri-
can, oppressively gloomy, and quite middle-aged
m the part. Also he wants power (or he did last
Saturday) in the scene where he flings a few brass
farthings at his dissimulating idolatress and calls
the company to witness that he is repaying her
the wealth she lavished on him- Tempestuous
hysteria is not Mr, Kolker’s forte. Syd Stirling
(Count de Varville), Miss Susie Vaughan, Cyril
Mackay, Miss Evans and others will assist to
carry the tired drama to the end of its
brief revival, and on Saturday a week of “ Zira ”
will be inaugurated; after which “Twelfth
Night,” according to present arrangements, will
close the season in an odor of Shakspearian
sanctity. Melbourne has acquired a strong liking
for “Twelfth Night ” within the past few years,
and if it gets the opportunity of seeing Titheradge
as Malvolio the city may be trusted to prove suffi-
ciently grateful. Meanwhile, there is “Zira,” in
which Miss Anglin has one of her best parts.

At the Princess’s the demand for ‘ ‘ Morals
of Marcus ” showed an upward tendency during
last week, and if a fickle public persists in talking
about the merits of the comedy it will presently
attain the dimensions of a pronounced success or
a veritable triumph. Thus far the management
has been content to call it a Fascinating Play.
Few managerial declarations are so simply truth-
ful. “The Morals of Marcus” has a very strong
fascination for the numerous individual who is
ignorant of the story in book form. The incon-

siderable number of people who come along loaded
with a previous knowledge of Carlotta, Marcus,
and Mrs. Mainwaring and all things appertaining
themto, are possibly less charmed with the play
than those who come and get acquainted with the
play for the first time and find it difficult to
understand on a first hearing. Carlotta excites
curiosity. Her account of herself (in the
first act) leaves her sanity in doubt. She throws
no light whatever on the character of “Harry,”
and doesn’t appear to know why she is glad he
committed suicide. When her'step-father ap-
proaches her on the question of her return to his
harem, or somebody else’s harem, he talks to her
in Turkish, and the audience is left to wonder
what kind of “ dreadful things ” he said to her.
There is only Carlotta’s word for their alleged
dreadfulness, and it may be that he was merely
asking her the , latest Turkish conundrum, or in-
viting her to enter for an Oriental limerick com-
petition, as, for instance—“ There was a young
nymph of the Bosphorus, who painted her features
with phosphorus; when an amorous ‘ spark ’ took
her out in the dark” . After three visits to
“The Morals of Marcus” the present commenta-
tor has not arrived at a notion of Oarlotta’s Past,
but he will be always open to give her the benefit
of the doubt until she is proved otherwise.
* * * m
The acting has quickened since the first
night. The general effect is brighter. More
warmth might be infused into the dialogue be-
tween Marcus and Mrs. Mainwaring at the end
of the third act, and it is certain that their unemo-
tional conversation in the first act could be pruned
of some half-dozen lines—notably the reference
to Marcus Aurelius—that are neither smart nor
necessary. Also Antoinette, the servant, should
lay less emphasis on her intimation that she is
about to dress Carlotta up in a flaming red cos-
tume, so as to prepare the audience for the damsel’s
farcical-comedy entrance a few minutes later. For
the rest of it, the show improves on acquaintance.
Carlotta, by speaking less slowly, has lost none of
her cnarm, and the opening picture is an attrac-
tion in itself.

“ Maritana,” because ifc is “Maritana,”
draws people to Melbourne Royal who stayed
severely away what time “ The Lily of Killarney ”
was on the bill. The company, being more
Hibernian than Spanish, fitted the previous
opera better than the dear old thing it
is just now engaged with. In the present
instance two or three of the co. seem ill at ease in
their magnificence, and when nobody is singing
the performance grows unconsciously humorous.
Still, there are “Happy Moments” in “ Maritana,”
likewise “A Flower that Bloometh” and an air of
Myst-ereo, not to mention other time-honored
melodies that have survived in spite of thre«
generations of organ grinders. Don Caesar changes
his identity every evening— i.e., there are two of
him, and both of his voices will remain a credit to
his ancient race until the end of the season, pro-
bably. The sands of the season are passing in
swift but tranquil tide away through Time’s
unerring glass. On Derby Night the long-lost
dramatic company returns, and Miss Mclntosh
will appear in “She Stoops to Conquer.”

On Saturday afternoon a thin audience
welcomed Katharine Goodson at Melb. Town Hall.
The crowds were mostly listening to the music of
the bookmakers at Caulfield, or lining the banks
of the Yarra, where a number of rival college boys
were pushing spider-like boats over the water.
But if it was a thin audience it was
critical to a degree that is impossible in a
very fat assembly. Edward Scharf and his wife—
both accomplished pianists—big Maggie Stirling,
little Rita Hope, and Una Bourne, came to criti-
cise and remained to applaud. The new Russian
Consul, with the name that sounds like a hail-
storm, was m evidence with his wife; and Mrs.
Chief' Justice Madden, and her mother, and
other indefatigables were there. Marshall
Hall loomed up out of a funereal dais
draped in cold white cloth and lilies (the
dais, not Mr. M. Hall). The star sent a flutter
through the hall, when she at.last appeared
in a shimmering pale blue gown on which the
“ betrothal opal ” gleamed. As an artist, she
captured the admiration of Melbourne’s most
exacting music lovers, her most successful item
being Greig’s concerto in A minor, heard for the
first time here with the orchestral background. A
fortnight previously, Mark Hambourg, with a
more expensive edition of the orchestra, played
Tschaikowsky s concerto, and Miss Goodson dar-
ingly challenged comparison. While her render-
ing was strong, graceful, and expressive, it failed
to reproduce the barbaric note that dominates the
Russian’s music. But as a pianiste—remember-
ing the “e”—the gifted young performer is
delightful, and surprisingly magnetic.

At Melbourne Town Hall, where Miss
Goodson was to give her final (for the present)
piano recital on Tuesday, the Ada Crossley con-
cert co. takes possession to-night (Thursday); and
the box plan is just now being enthusiastically
marked off. Four subsequent concerts, on the 17th,
20th, 22nd and 24th, are announced.

The lady who lapses oft into melancholy and
calls herself “ The Gayest of the Gay ” will utter
her despondent laugh no more after Friday at the
King’s. As Andersonian bellowdramasgo, “The
G. of the G.” was somewhat of a snorter, with a
large, complicated plot and many penitent girls in
it. For the sake of its lovely moral it might have
been given another week. No previous drama
within The Bulletin’s recollection has presented
so many cases of female reformation ; for when
Miss Duggan returns to the path of virtue
and undertakes nursing at the hospital, she
seemingly rings up her old giddy companions, and
persuades them to follow her lead. Anyhow, the
eight minor nurses who adopt the white apron of
a blameless life bear a suspicious resemblance to
the Lotties and Totties of the second act; and
the sight of them, ranged in meekness at the hos-
pital, suggests great possibilities in the restora-
tion of fallen sisters to a state of uprightness.
On Saturday, the old Drury Lane drama,
“ Human Nature,” is to be revived at the King’s.
Long years ago, when the Triumvirate ran the
Royal, this was a mighty drama, and the name
should draw the attention of many persons who
have grown older in the meantime.

At the Bijou another week of “ Miss Lan-
cashire Limited ” will bring Miss Florence Baines’
season to a finale. Her advt. has “Farewell”
imprinted on its brow, and the lady’s admirers are
desired to lose no more time in responding to her
summons.
The Great Marconis, the electrical per-
sonages who were affixed to the catalogue at
Melb. Opera House on Saturday, somehow fail to
dumbfound. They have a shopful of apparatus,
which spits and sputters, but does not horrify.
They emit anything from conflagrations to gas
flames from the place wnence coarse men eject bad
anecdotes. They pick sparks and other lllumin-
ants from their bodies, as if they were orchards of
electrical phenomena. Yet, with all their mani-
festations, they do not seem inhuman. Gregson
and Goodfellow gave a turn that was rather foolish
and purposeless, but a spice of novelty saved it.
Another first appearance was that of the Reno
Sisters, two damsels who have partially circum-
navigated the globe to exhibit legeentricities in
four changes of costume. Also Mignonette Kokin
appeared in new turns with great success.

Wirths’ Olympia, in -which West’s Pic-
tures are happening all the time, will have Wirths’
circus in the neighborhood on Saturday. The
circus, as stated last week, is to be established on
the pitch that was known as Princes Court until
it became Wirths’ Park, and here the vast tent
will embrace a theatre, a race track, an “elevated
oval for special novelties,” and other things calcu-
lated to lure the madding crowd to the highly-
illuminated rendezvous by Princes Bridge.

The Cherniavskis have finished their week
at Adelaide Town Hall. The gifted children
(one of them is getting rather big for the Child
pose) seem to be competent artists, with a full
appreciation as well of the personal extras which
go so far to make an artist successful at the box-
office. The said box-office has been kept steadily
im, ky the public, but not exactly rushed.
Ihe Welsh singers are due shortly. Fitzgerald’s
Circus is a joyful circumstance without deserving
extended notice. And at the Royal the Geach
co. is putting some good acting into some poor
plays. This week’s curiosity is called “The
Woman Pays,” and it is estimated that, so far,
2503 people have made the obvious joke on the
subject when buying their tickets.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The mighty Butt has started to provide the British
press with quaint stories of what befell her in the Austra-
lian wilds. She passed this anecdote concerning the
woolly ways of Maoriland to the trusting editor of the
Musical Home Journal :—“ VVe found awaiting us at the
station the local carriage and pair, with the local under-
taker as footman. He was garbed in the usual funereal suit
of black, but he had substituted a white tie, in order to
relieve the situation somewhat, and, evidently with a
desire to dispel any morbid impressions, he commenced
to whistle a selection of the most cheerful tunes he knew
while he held the door open for us and helped us into the
carriage.” In Australia, she told the London Sunday Sun,
a Society lady” wrote to her pointing out that “the
concert dresses which she had been wearing would prob-
ably be useless to her,” and suggested, therefore, that
one should be sent to her (the Society dame), “asshe was
going to a party the following week and had nothing suit-
-6 j 'year.” The whistling undertaker-footman and
the old clo -seeking and outsize Society female are alike
weirdly improbable, but the British public has learned to
expect these curious folk from returned W’anderers, so
Clara heroically meets the demand.
Annette Kellermann lately swam 11J
miles in Boston Harbor—from Charles-
town Bridge to within half-a-mile of
Boston Light—in 6hr. 24min. The
whole distance from Bridge to Light
is about 12 miles ; the latter portion
of the journey is through a rough
open sea, and thus far only one man
has tackled it successfully. Last year
30 crack swimmers failed to do it in a
competition for a prize Cup. All things
considered, Annette’s performance was
a big ,one, and but for night coming on,
she might have struggled along to
the winning point. Anyhow, the
*' splendid failure ” served to boom her
Mermaiden show at Boston Wonder-
land. As a talker to the press Annette
is improving all the time. She tells
the reporters that dancing and swim-
ming are kindred arts. “All last
winter I was learning different kinds
of dancing in Paris. My swimming
makes it come most easily to me, and
so good dancers will find that their
ability will soon make the finest of swim-
mers of them.” Annette is the muscular
daughter of a Frenchwoman—a musical artist—and her
education as a dancer began when she was a child. Her
doctrine is, however, subject to a heavy discount when
applied to ordinary swimmers and comparatively fragile
danseuses. 0
The Meynell and Gunn Dramatic Co., with Miss Mclntosh
and Harcourt Beatty in the lead, returns to Melbourne
Royal on October 31, and plays Oliver Goldsmith’s comedy
“ She Stoops to Conquer.” Another chance for students
of the antique in dramatic work. To the present Mel-
bourne generation “She Stoops to Conquer” is prac-
tically unknown. The Brough and Boucicault co. tried
it with moderate success many years ago, Mrs. Brough
doing the “stoop” as Kate Hardcastle, and Brough
appearing as Tony Lumpkin. Also Kyrle Bellew and
Mrs. Potter are said to have staged the quaint old comedy,
but, if they did, the performance made no abiding im-
pression on the sands of time. The forthcoming revival
will come as a novelty.
“Sceneshifter”; “The Lily of Killarney,” the lyrical
version of Boucicault s “Colleen Bawn,” recently revived
at Melbourne Royal, introduces the cave scene with the
transparent stage-water effects. Until the piece was first
produced in London, in 1860, transparent stage-water had
never been seen, and a few yards of blue gauze was a
mightier draw than the finest acting in the world. It
filled the London Adelphi for hundreds of nights, it
poured coin into the treasuries of provincial managers,
sent people to the theatre who had never been before
and made the fortune of the author. Yet the author was
actually not the inventor of the wonderful thing ; the
idea first occurred to an old stage carpenter who’ was
working on the job.
The Melbourne medical students, who have been keep-
ing very good and quiet for a long time past, are
preparing for a night at the Princess’s on Tuesday
Oct. 20.
“ Theorbo ” : With ‘ ‘ Maritana ” staged one may refresh
by noting Vincent Wallace’s extraordinary career. Born
1814, a native of Waterford, Ireland, his father was a
regimental bandmaster, afterward bassoonist in the
orchestra of Theatre Royal, Dublin, where his son Wel-
lington played the flute and Vincent the violin. Vincent
was a prodigy with piano, violin, clarionet and guitar.
He was organist of Thurles Cathedral at 16 years old •
then leader at the Dublin concerts. He married in 1834
and came to N. S. Wales in 1835, having separated from
hiswife. In N. S. Wales he engaged in sheep farming
Governor Bourke was enchanted with his piano-playin"
and gave him 100 sheep for concert tickets. Yet Wallace
went off to Tasmania, then to Maoriland, where a
chief’s daughter saved his life. He utilised this in
an opera called “The Desert Flower.” Next he went
whaling in the steamer Good Intent. The Maoris in the
crew mutinied, and killed all the white men except
Wallace and two others. Next Wallace was off to India
where he enchanted the Begum of Oude. In India he
found his way even as far as Nepal and Kashmir. Left
India at a day’s notice for Valparaiso ; crossed the Andes
to Buenos Aires ; recrossed to Santiago and Lima where
he realised £lOOO by a concert. Next he turned up in
Mexico, where he composed a fine Mass. He invested in
pianos and tobacco, and became bankrupt. After that he
went to London, arriving in 1845; “Maritana” was pro-
duced the same year, and made a great hit, on the
strength of which he went to Germany, Paris and the
United States of America. He returned to England in
1853. Seven years later he produced “Lurline” with
immense success. Died at a chateau in the Pyrenees
Left an indigent widow, known as Madame Stoepel a
pianist. r >
‘‘Melb ’’O er y discursively): A morning paper says
that Maritana was first seen here about 1864. It was
produced at Coppin’s Olympic (Melbourne) in 1856 bv a
small company from England, shortly after Brooke took
his farewell of that theatre as Petruchio, before migrating
to the Royal. The cast of “ Maritana,” in 1856, included
Julia Harland, wife of Hoskins, as Maritana, Farquharson
as Don Jose, and Sherwin as Don Caßsar. Conductor,
Linley Norman. Hoskins, of whom Titheradge is a
reminder, came to Australia with this company, and
used to act in farces after the operas. He gave up
a fine position at Sadler’s Wells, with Phelps. His
Lucio, in “Measure for Measure,” had made a hit,
and his portrait, in this character, will be found in one of
the finest illustrated editions of Shakspeare. Julia
Harland’s last appearance on the Melbourne stage appears
to have been in a small part in the burlesque of “ Black-
lived Susan,” when acted by Kate Denin at the Hay-
market about 1866. Farquharson was immediately
engaged by Lyster on, arriving with his company about
1000, and featured as Marcel in “The Huguenots.” He
was great also in “Elijah,” with the Philharmonic, but
he was an unreliable man. It is alleged that once, with
the Phil., he only stood up, and Sara Flower, the power-
ful contralto, sang his music. Sherwin travelled with the
Carandinis. Rather a tinpotty tenor. Dost an arm out
shooting. Squires was good as Don Caesar, but that char-
acter must always be associated in the Australian mind
with Armes Beaumont.
“Lyre ” : There is a common delusion that “ Maritana ”
was composed in Sydney. Wallace did not obtain the
libretto till he arrived in London, in 1845, after his travels,
let the music must have been simmering in his mind for
many years. “Maritana” is probably a hastily-con-
cocted cento of ballads he had composed before. When
he reached London the play of “ Don Cmsar de Bazan,”
by Dennery, was at the height of its popularity. It was
first acted in Paris by Lemaitre, then in London by Wallack.
Fitzball, the dramatic author, suggested that Wallace
might scrape together music for an opera on the theme.
It was put together with the rapidity of Handel’s
Messiah,” which only took six weeks. Yet the copious
ballads all bear the stamp of long meditation. A man
does not runoff such things. They do not verv strictly
belong to the opera, nor any opera. I think Wallace’s
n “ mr * lne ”> s essentially finer, and more of an opera, than
Maritana.” Australia loved it in Lyster’s time. Re-
member the “Take this Cup of Sparkling Wine,” and
Sweet Spirit, Hear My Prayer,” the gem of the
Aladdm burlesque when Julia Matthews was Aladdin.
Wallace thought “ The Amber Witch ” his best opera.
Frances Alda, nie Davis, is a singer not long ago well-
known to Sydney playgoers as Francie Adler. She comes
of a musical family, for her mother was Leonora, eldest
daughter of Martin and Fanny Simonsen. Recently she
sang with considerable success in opera in Paris, and now
she has appeared before what is generally conceded to be
the most critical audience in Europe, at La Scala, Milan.
Ihe opera was Charpentier’s “Luisa,” not exactly new,
for it was produced seven years ago at the Teafcro Lirico,
Milan, and neither on that occasion nor on this with very
much success. L’lllustrazionk Italiana, one of the best
illustrated papers published in Italy, thus speaks of
her: “Among all distinguished herself Mrs. Frances
Alda, new to our public, an Australian who has
all the grace of a true Parisienne. In the part of the
protagonist, she is perfect. She sings with security and
suavity, and is a skilful and intelligent actress. She was
accorded the greatest applause of the evening, particu-
larly after the romance in the third act.” There is no mis-
take about Australia being a voice factory.
LIFE ON A DESERT ISLAND.
SURVIVORS OF THE AEON.
The chaplain held services on Sunday, but all were toft
tired to attend.
“Aha!” thought the parson: “Now I have got
'em. They are surrounded by the sea. Nothing
can save them.” But he was mistaken, for
sleep rescued them just as it has rescued
every other congregation.
“ F.M.”: The production of “ The Taming of the
Shrew,” at Melbourne Her Majesty’s, is interesting as
Shakspeare invariably must be. It is funny and it is
human. Yet there is one terrible fault. The Shrew’s
face and shoulders are altogether beautiful, and she has
a presence and gesture that call for sympathy instead of
scorn. The Tamer puts too much whip into the thing,
and when we think of that w hip and those \vhite shoul-
ders in the same think, any man with any sense of com-
passion in him must shudder. It is too brutal altogether,
and it should not appear brutal. This is Miss Anglin’s
faulr. She is so awfully nice when she should be sour and
haggard. In the country-road scene, when Petruchio
cracks his whip over the woman who has collapsed from
hunger, sleeplessness and exhaustion, the cruelty of it is
too much. And it is all because Katharine always retains
the sympathy of the audience. By the bye, why is there
so much surprise expressed in the papers because “ The
Shrew” is produced wdthout “The Induction”? Is
Shakspeare ever produced nowadays without first being
put through the sausage machine? So far as the written
play of “ The Shrew ” goes, the funniest line in it is in the
stage directions. Hortensio goes out to teach Katharine
how to play the lute, and then the directions read:
“Enter Hortensio with his head broke”! That is a
delightful way of putting it.
A SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION.
SAID TO CURE RHRUMATISH, KIDNEY TROUBLE
AND BLADDER TROUBLES.
We know that the readers of this paper appre-
ciate good advice, and we are glad, therefore, to
be able to publish the following from a prominent
physician.
It is astonishing to know the prevalence of
kidney trouble and other diseases, such as rheu-
matism, bladder and liver troubles, which are
almost invariably caused by weak kidneys. It is
said on good authority that fully one-third of the
people in Australia who have reached the age of
maturity are more or less afflicted with kidney
trouble in some form. The most dangerous
feature of this disease is the fact that many
people have it without their knowledge, and con-
sequently neglect it until it has reached a danger-
ous stage.
The least symptom of- kidney trouble, such as
backache, must be given prompt attention, and a
good reliable treatment should be taken, until
every trace of the disease has been eliminated.
We are glad to be able to give our readers a pre-
scription which we have seldom known to fail in
any case. It contains no harmful ingredients, is
pleasant to take, not expensive, and can be
supplied by any good chemist. It is as follows :
Tincture Gentian Compound, one ounce;
Syrup Rhubarb, one ounce ; Liquid Barkola Com-
pound, one ounce ; Syrup of Ginger, five ounces.
Take a teaspoonful after each meal, and one at
bedtime.
We are glad to publish this prescription, as we
know it will help our afflicted readers who give it
a fair trial. If taken continuously for a few
weeks it will be found to be an almost absolutely
certain cure for rheumatism, kidney and bladder
trouble, backache, and all allied complaints.

SHOPWALKER: “Is there anyone waiting on you
Miss?”
MISS (blushing): “Fes, that’s my young man.
He wouldn’t come in.”
The ancients at the Liverpool (N.S.W.)
tubercle farm, officially known as the Liverpool
Asylum for the Infirm, took an extra interest in
the papers the other morning ; for the announce-
ment was then made that the old quarrel between
Superintendent Dr. Beattie and G. E. Brodie had
ended in the latter’s retirement from the job of
Inspector-General of Charities. Brodie was pre-
viously an inspector of accounts, and had fair
chances once of being made Auditor-General; but
instead some amazing blunderer turned him on to
the work of bossing the State charitable institu-
tions, and he promptly made himself famous by
reducing the poor little gratuities paid to the
inmate attendants from 3fd. to 2|d. or so a
day—and some of the attendants have to look
after cancer patients and do other most
disagreeable work of that kind. By this master-
stroke of finance the total amount of gratuities
paid in all Government asylums for the old and
infirm was reduced from £3776 11s. Sd. in one year
to £2917 3s. 3d. in the next, and the other
£859 Bs. sd. helped to make the “Reform
Government’s surplus. Then Brodie began a
great battle with Dr. Beattie over some
mineral water which he alleged Beattie had im-
properly allowed to be consumed ; and when
Beattie showed that it was taken medicinally on
the prescription of two doctors, and amounted
to a whole ten-shillings’ worth anyway, the
Public Service Board reckoned the farce had
gone far enough. So the ancients who
have to attend to the cancer patients and the
other disagreeable jobs are to get back their 3fd.
per day, and Dr. Beattie can have another bottle of
mineral water if it is needed, and the square Mr.
Brodie is taken out of his round hole in the
Charities Dept, and dropped into the Taxation
Dept., where he ought to be a tremendous suc-
cess if he pursues the odd penny with the old
vigor. In his place Dr. Baton —the pawky
kindly Scotch gentleman (and a real gentleman
he is) who for years past has been looking at
prisoners in gaol and deciding whether they are
insane or not —becomes Inspector-General of the
tubercle farm and the other asylums.

It was rumored a while ago that Geelong
(Vic.) was waking up; but a recent decision of
the local council shows that there was no truth
in the story. The sanitary inspector, observing
three scoops of rotten barracouta standing along-
side a fence, looked into the neighboring yard of
a milk vendor, and in that yard, right where cows
were milked and milk carts and cans were kept,
he found decomposing fish and other abomina-
tions lying in pits till the pigs should need a
little light refreshment. The inspector then got
the dairy-supervisor to investigate, and, both
being of opinion that the case called for heavy
steps, he asked the council for instructions to pro-
secute. Also, he assured the city grandfathers
that typhoid had already broken out in families to
whom this man had supplied milk. One venture-
some councillor proposed that the officer should
be authorised to go ahead, but the majority,
having yawned three times, decided to gently
request the gentleman to clean up his place—any
time within a week would do. So Geelong is still
Geelong, after all.

N.S.W. Railway Commissioners decided,
the other day, to light the North Shore Suburban
line tunnel. Evidently, they consulted an oculist
on the subject, and the oculist was thoughtful
for the growth of his own business. A few small
electric lights have been attached to the sides of
the tunnel at long intervals, and the effect as the
train runs through is of a series of bewildering
flashes. A few months of travelling through that
tunnel twice a day will ruin many good eyes.
The N.S.W. law allows divorce in cases
where there has been desertion for three years and
upwards; and if either party receives from
an ungrateful country an award of three
years’ imprisonment, or has been frequently
sentenced, it counts as enough desertion to
justify the breaking-up of the happy home
in an official manner. Out of this, the other
day, arose a point in Sydney Divorce Court
which looks capable of providing Costs on
a very healthy scale. For in this case,
though the husband had received three sen-
tences of 12 months each, they all landed
upon him on the same day, and the sen-
tences were concurrent, with the result that
he only “did time’’for one year. The Divorce
Act didn’t apparently legislate for this
very obvious possibility, and the Divorce
Judge, in dismissing the suit, gave the peti-
tioner a hint to pursue the point and Costs
through the Courts of Appeal.
As a rule, the most formidable thing about
the old inhabitant is his memory. Awaken it
with a chance remark and it arises and wanders
relentlessly into the Past, to gather the weed of
Reminiscence and uproot the bones of Romance.
But a quite unusual ancient, because his memory
had completely run down, happened along to the
Carlton (Vic.) Court last week, in pursuit of an
old-age pension. First of all he stated that he
could not remember the Christian or maiden
name of his mother. He had a sort of idea he had
been married in Tasmania many years ago, but he
was drunk at the time, and could not swear to it,
as he had never bothered to ask for the certificate.
Somebody had once told him that he had a wife
and child, and that they had both died ; but he
could not give any particulars about the deceased,
owing to there being the usual moth-hole in his
memory at that point. Then, having amazed the
Court with the list of things that had leaked out
of his mind, he remarked proudly that the one
thing he was certain about was his age, which was
67. The Commissioner looked at him, and in-
stantly decided that he was wrong. Directions
were, however, issued that the Tasmanian authori-
ties be communicated with and asked if they could
supply any further information re the Great For-
getter, whose sole recollection, or thereabouts,
was the spree he had had when he married his for-
gotten bride.
HER DIGNITY.
ENID (doing a lesson about one of Britain’s famous Admirals): “Mamma, how do
you, spell Collingwood ?”
MELBOURNE PARENT : “ Tell Miss Masharn I don’t send you to her school to learn about a
place like Collingwood!”
Mr. Stiggins scored a great victory in S.
Aus. last year, and induced the Parliament to
pass an Act for the suppression of the House that
Flossie lives in. The measure has been at work
for about 12 months, and in his annual report the
Inspector-General of Police (who was the head of
the training college for teachers before he got the
other job) tells what has happened. Fines amount-
ing to £94 15s. have been inflicted, and the House
that Flossie lived in has been closed up. Never-
theless Flossie, he admits, hasn’t been extirpated
or even reformed ; but when she’s at home she
isn’t at home, in a Sassiety way of speaking. It is
difficult, says Colonel Madley, to say where Flossie’s
place of business is under the new conditions ; but
he mentions that “loose women have been seen in
dark lanes, rights-of-way, and the park lands,”
and—well, the Colonel has his suspicions. Also
you never quite know what you’re liable to
stumble against in the private parlors of Adelaide
pubs nowadays. In fact, one publican stumbled
against unexpected things so often that he had the
doors taken away from his parlors and public sit-
ting-rooms, and another, the Inspector-General
says, “ keeps a man constantly visiting his
parlors.” So if Flossie has lost her job (more or
less), a new industry has been created—the Man
above Suspicion who Circulates among Pub
Parlors.

Vic. Salvarmy has got badly burnt in
an attempt to escape a microscopic fine. A
while back, a male and female belonging
to the Sale corps were exhorting people to
certain ablutions, when the Law requested
them to move on. They wouldn’t, so the
Law, in the person of Harris, P.M., smote them
to the extent of 10s. for street obstruction.
Thereupon they began to appeal. They asked
Justice Hodges for an order nisi to review the
magisterial decision, and his Honor threw them
out. They proceeded to the State Full Court on
a similar errand, and were_ again ejected. Un-
daunted, and now imagining themselves to be
burning comets with the of the .world upon
them, they requested the High Court to review
the first decision, and were once more dismissed,
with Costs against them. In fact, Costs had been
playing band selections all the time. The Harmy
in Vic. will have a heavy bill to pay, the result,
seemingly, of a determination to shed any quan-
tity of coin to maintain a principle. Still they
probably had to shed any quantity of principle to
obtain the coin, so the account is about square !
The Powerful court-martial went the
limit in sentencing the man-o’-warstnan who
threw ship’s goods overboard to two years. The
offender thought in his foolishness that J. Bull
would expel him from the service, and so enable
him to settle down with an uncle in Australia.
But Bull wasn’t doing things that way. The
convict will be fired off his ship, not in Australia,
in all likelihood, but at the other end of the world,
and neither Australia nor his uncle will want him
when that time comes. The captain of a, man-o -
war can give up to 90 days’ “hard ” in a civil gaol,
and that was the worst the unhappy ass on the
Powerful expected. He forgot that naval law,
like land law, has a good deal of elasticity. It was
felt that he should be transformed into a “hor-
rible example”; and so the senior officers of the
ships in Sydney harbor were constituted a court-
martial.

From one of the ancients :
A petition is being circulated in Parramatta (N.S.W.)
asking for the removal of the asylums for the infirm from
that town. The petition alleges that “ the citizens of
Parramatta” Drotest against the presence of these
asylums; but‘before the Government agrees, we old
people hope it will find out how the petition was engi-
neered. The document hypocritically says the removal
is in our interests, and on that false ground many signed
it. It would he cruel to exile us, as is proposed, to a place
where our friends could never visit us, where many of us
would have no personal communication with the outside
world, where there would be no shops from which to
procure little comforts not supplied in the rations—in
fact, to condemn helpless people to expatriation simply
because we are poor and are supposed to have no friends
in Parliament.

Right in the heart of Adelaide the in-
tensely practical S. Australian Government has
built a school that will accommodate no more
than 24 children. Away out in the backblox S.
Australia has what it calls “provisional schools,
mostly hitherto taught by people who haven’t had
any training as teachers —a job, in fact, which has
often gone to well-educated failures in other walks
of crust-making. Lately it was concluded that
the educated failures might at least be given a
scrap of training before being sent out; so this
“ provisional” school has been set up in Adelaide,
and put in charge of a woman (many of the pro-
visional teachers are women) who is reckoned an
expert in keeping six classes going at one time ;
and the candidates who are waiting for the poor
and usually temporary job of provisional-school
teaching will attend at the tiny little model to see
how the miracle is done.
SPRING ON THE BLOCK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Let other singers rave of Spring
Where wattle floods come rolling down
The range’s slope, but I shall cling
To seasonable joys in town.
No lush greens grow in Oollins-street,
Nor do the parrots hither flock ;
No bush bloom odors, cloying sweet,
Surge up to meet you on the Block ;
But Spring arrives, a jaunty queen,
And sudden all the town is gay.
In flowing robe, with merry mien,
I met her only yesterday.
Blue heaven lay along the roofs,
The little girls were all a-wing
Like butterflies. Here, here were proofs;
My heart cried out: “It is the Spring 1 ”
She’s tall and lithe, her hair’s aflame
With wall- flower and with marigold ;
She puts sobrieties to shame,
And makes the meekest buds grow bold.
All loveliness of bird and bloom
Goes gaily with her. Wide and free
She scatters lustre and perfume,
And dainty, dear audacity.
Let others sing of fields where Spring
Has squandered jewels in the grass,
For I love best this subtle thing,
Fresh prinked and braided from the glass.
Her lip may be a touch too red,
Her cheek be somewhat over-bright;
Perchance, as certain prudes have said,
She wears her stays a trifle tight.
But she’s Queen Glorious. I sing
Her rapture in no mincing vein,
Content if this reward it bring—
A Block nymph of her merry train.
Blue eye or grey, twin lips that cling,
A mouth of laughter—these for me 1
Thou’rt prodigal; but, Lady Spring,
Thy servant asks no more of thee.
via.

Do you know how to get at millions in
Chancery ? Australia, starting off with the Tich-
borne claimant, is always exporting persons who
claim estates, titles, millions “in Chancery.”
Well, Mr. Jobson, who went to England to inves-
tigate the Australian claim to “ The Page
Millions,” tells the story in the November Lone
Hand.
Rodin, of course, you know. Every civilised
man knows Rodin, the greatest sculptor since the
days of the Greeks. He has given a special inter-
view to The Lone Hand about his methods and
ideals. It is published with some pictures of his
great works, and a portrait of his studio as
arranged recently for the visit of King Edward.
S. H. Prior, financial editor of The Bolletin,
begins a money-bags section in The Lone Hand
next month. It will be of profound interest to
the investing public, and also to those who take
any thought of that fascinating subject—Money.
The month’s review “ Australian—not partisan ”
will be another interesting feature.
C. H. Kirmess’ great forecast romance, “ The
Commonwealth Crisis,” is carried forward a big
step. Already profound attention has been
attracted by this work, and succeeding chapters
will justify that attention.
About the stories, the verse, and a score other
features some talk next week.

“ MEN’S
OUTFITTERS,’
The Oldest Inhabitant goes on remember-
ing ancient pubs and ancient landlords
The present Liquor Act has done what its promoters
outside Parliament never intended it should ao. It has
caused the demolition of many of the old pubs, which are
being replaced by palatial buildings. Instance the West-
minster, in George-street West. The house which is to
cake its place is to be a replica in miniature of the British
Houses of Parliament. Another landmark to go stood on
the N.-W. corner of King and Oastlereagh streets, a great
theatrical house. It was built in the early Ws. One of
the first landlords was the late Edwin Gee, who kept
it as the Montpelier. Then came Nat Smith, who called
it the Royal Navy. It then became the Oontinental, kept
by Albert Kirschbaum, who was followed by Eastway,
James Gordon Jackson and J. J. Power. The last made
a.fortune in the house, and, having toured the world,
came back and entered Parliament as a Labor member for
West Sydney.

“Narrabeen” tells of a romance that
went wrong
Don’t talk to me about romance in real life. I had
been expecting someone to call to see me for ages. I did
out the drawing-room every day, called on all the neigh-
bors that had flower gardens, dolled up poor old mater in
a tight black velvet bodice that she loathes. And he
never came. Then we had the spring cleaning. I
polished and shook and dusted and swept until the
beeswax and turpentine got into my soul. I tote down
everything that was up, and took up everything that was
down, and at last worked myself into a first-class fit of
hysterics. Then I retired from the field of battle, and—
oh, yes, he came. I ought to have been wandering in the
garden (I had arranged it a hundred times), with some-
thing fleecy thrown carelessly over my head. Then there
ought to have been a quick step, and the scent of a good
cigar—no, fragrant cigar—that would be hurled away
directly he saw me. And the fact ? Well, I had on my
worst blouse, one that never suited me, and I shuffled to
the door in old tennis slippers. And there was Fred—
with a most awful cold in his head, and he put the butt
of a cigar carefully in my one pot of musk, and growled,
and slapped his pocket, and said, “ I’ve lost my handker-
chief somewhere.”

Melbourne, or part of it, witnessed a
shameful piece of humiliation and meanness the
other day, when a man who had lately been sen-
tenced to four years’ gaol for a crime in Ballarat
was taken from Spencer-street railway station to
Pentridge on the twopenny tram, handcuffed to
an armed constable. The man was sentenced to
four years’gaol—he wasn’t sentenced to be made
an exhibition of through the streets of the city.
And the Government that does that sort of thing
talks about its great interest in the “reforma-
tion ” of prisoners 1
SEEN IN PASSING.
JIM: “ Who was that?"
FLO: "My husband. I thought you knew him.”
Things are not what they used to be in
“the West.” Five years ago and thereabouts, if
a young woman turned up at Perth, 17 men and
a fraction would most likely line up within a fort-
night, each with his heart in one hand, a nugget
in the other, and an offer of marriage in his mouth.
In 1903, even in Perth, there were only 82 females
to every 100 males, and on the goldfields the
females were almost too few in the bundle to
count. But now, in Perth, there are 101 of the
sex that wears poultry on its head to every 100 of
the others, and the district of North Perth, which
in 1903 only had 92 Bellas and Janes to every 100
Bills and Johns, now, alas ! has no less than 160
of them; wherefore the pursuit of a husband is
becoming as desperate a proceeding as it is in
East Melbourne or any other part of the Vic-
torian State of big landlords and elderly maids.
INTERNATIONAL ETIQUETTE.
FOREIGN CONSUL (Sydney): “ The strained relations at present existing between my Government

“Viator”: Putnam Weale’s last book,
“The Coming Struggle in the Far East,” is
written after Manchurian travel, which was in
the early part of 1907. So he is the latest,
formerly he was pro-Japanese. Now he is anti-
Jap. Says Japan is preparing trouble even for
England. Harbin has 80,000 Russian inhabitants.
Yet in 1897 it had only two white men. What
builders these Russians are !
It is more astounding than
Johannesburg and very much
more significant, for Harbin,
like Chicago, is planted on
substantial resources. Not
only is it in railway and tele-
graphic communication with
Russia, but it is built along-
side the grand river Sungari,
1000 miles long, a waterway
for traffic somewhat compar-
able to the Yangtse. The
region is richly agricultural
for a vast space round Harbin.
Before the war, great flour
mills were established there.
The Russians never had to
fetch flour, meat, vegetables,
tea or fodder along the
Siberian railroad. Yet the
genius of. Director-in-Chief
Khilkoff was taxed to the ut-
most. He had to deal with a
single line, with copious
sidings. It carried as many
as 10 trains per day each way,
total 32. Over a million Rus-
sian soldiers were taken. The
Russians were preparing to
send 700,000 more, or 200,000
more than the army that
Napoleon took to Moscow.
The number of horses sent
from Russia amounted to
nearly 250,000. Weale makes
out that the Japs were sure to
have been beaten. Linievitch
had constructed something
like Wellington’s lines of
Torres Vedras. Harbin was
the depbt. The photos show
quite magnificent edifices. The
business future of Russian
Manchuria is incalculable, and
millions, too, of free citizens are going to Siberia.
Weale went south from Harbin, transferring from
the sft. gauge Russian railroad to the shabby
little 3ft. 6in. Japanese.

Providence isn’t always on the side of the
Big Drum. At Bourke (N.S.W.) a generous towns-
man presented the local Sal. Army with a block of
land in the centre of the town whereon to erect
barracks. He committed suicide afterwards—and
the Army prayed. Then a Darling River hurri-
cane came along between a prayer and a collection
and blew the edifice over. It was rebuilt; but
had scarcely recovered its perpendicular before
another windstorm tossed it on its side again.
The Army then gave it up for a bad job,' said
another prayer and removed the ruins, leaving
only the floor. The local youths have converted
this into a skating rink, and thereon in the moon-
lit nights they smoke cigarettes and make love to
the river maidens. And the disciple of General
Booth now holdeth the collection and basheth the
Large Drum in the office of the old Central Aus-
tralian —once owned and edited by W. N
Willis. W.N. isn’t dead.
Even after that veteran battler in strange
places, Capt. John Strahan, had given up the
wreck of the Chinese liner Australian as a bad
job, a Port Darwin firm decided lately to have a
dig at it. The ancient skipper, who has been re-
ported drowned so often that Thk Bulletin
wouldn’t believe it now even if Neptune and three
mermaids swore affidavits to that effect, made
over his rights to some Northern Territory store-
keeping people; and they went round lately in
the Wai Hoi to the reef near Vashon Head, where
the big vessel lies, looking from a distance as
though she were riding at anchor. But she
is fast aground from bow to Stern, and
after inspecting her fore and aft and side-
ways, Port Darwin did the same as John
htrahan, and likewise gave her up as as a bad job.
So by this time probably everything that is likely
to bring in a profit of tuppence is being torn from
f l "’ , lnc^u ding the polished satin wood decorations
of the saloon, and later on, if they can get the
water out, a raid will be made on the engine-room.
As for the cargo, the water in the holds is so foul
that that section will have to be given a wide
berth.

This evening (Thursday) the Vicar-
General, Archdeacon Gunther, of Parramatta,
will preside at a meeting in the Chapter
House, Sydney, when the question of a memorial
on the site of the first church in Australia
will be considered. The first church built
by first-parson Johnson was of the “wattle-and-
dab ’ order, and stood, approximately, on the
small triangular space at the junction of Hunter,
Bbgh, and Castlereagh streets. It was built in
1/93 at a cost of £67 12s. lljd., though another
account places the sum at 3d. more. The church
was burned down on October 1, 1798, by “ some
wicked and disaffected persons ” who resented
Governor Hunter’s general order to attend church
on Sundays.

Now that Melbourne Hospital is alleged
to be of loud repute regarding the wages it pays,
sundry bodies are getting inquisitive. As an
example, Coburg (Vic.) Council bluntly requested
the hospital to supply a list of its employees,
with details of their hours and state of affluence.'
lhe hospital committee looked at the application
with an air of mild surprise for a considerable
time, then someone named Jeffries got up and
erupted :
I think this request is deserving of something more
than an ordinary reception—the reception it should get
is a hot one. We have been publicly charged with being
sweaters” by a municipality which has, during the
last twelve months, sent us 195 patients, and contributed
to the hospital funds the munificent sum of £3, and its
sister municipality, Brunswick, sent us 1120 patients, and
contributed nothing at all. . . . Personally, I am g-lad
that these questions are asked, for, though we need not
necessarily give the information required, we have the
opportunity of drawing the attention of those who ask
them to the fact that, if there is any sweating, they are
the sweaters, for in the meanness of their support they
are actually sweating the hospital, and it’s a pity they
can tbe prosecuted for it. F * 3
Things in Coburg are now dead quiet.
A rifle club afc Ballarat; (Vic.) is leaching its
members to shoot in a historical building—the old
house at Bakery Hill, where Seekamp first printed
the Ballarat Times and wrote the fiery articles
that stiffened the diggers to resistance, and where
Beter Lalor swore his men to “be true to the
southern Cross.” The riflemen—most of them
Canadians, by the way—have at least a place
with inspiring records to spur them on to hit the
bull s eye.

“Fourth Lubber” puts on his sea-boots,
and speaks :
I always had an idea a chantey was a joyous sort ot
ditty. This impression had been gleaned from sea novels
and from the fierce, spray-dashed verse written by dry
poets who stay ashore and sing about the joys of being
afloat with brine in your whiskers and cockroaches in the
forecastle. On a recent Sunday morning a friend and I
rowed down Sydney Harbor as far as Bradley’s Head, to
have a look at the morning before the excursionist arose
and threw orange-peel on it. A tug kicked its way
up the harbor, like an ant towing a great four-
masted cockroach. The cockroach went up harbor and
let g-o both anchors with a roar and rumble of heavy
chain. Almost immediately the capstan was made into
a sort of rimless wheel by having six or seven capstan
bars stuck spoke-like in it, and the crew of twenty-odd
men, two or three to a bar, started to walk round and
round on the fo’castle, their object apparently being to
wind up some of the slack cable. They looked like low'-
sentenoe prisoners taking exercise in a circle in the gaol
yard. Ilound and round they went—not skipping merrily
as I had expected, as does the young goat on the moun-
tain, hut trudging silently with their chests pressing on
the massive bars. For about five minutes they circled
as ghosts might trek around the stove of Hell.
Suddenly a voice started a hoarse sort of lament, and
the circular procession responded with a united groan of
'‘Off V IUo-oh-oht ” They sang 59 verses, yet we could
distinguish nothing save the prolonged moan of the
chorus. It was the saddest wet-Sunday lamentation I
ever encountered. Are all chanteys like that—just the
broken-hearted cry of the wet forecastle and the ship-
biscuit, and the soul-harrowment of the corned beef ?

Ifc may be true that in the springtime
fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love ; but the
Victorian Registrar has found out by long experi-
ence that, in his State at any rate, the springtime
isn’t when the population turns towards the par-
son with the marrying fee in its hand. There
were 194,871 weddings in Victoria in the 25 years
1881-1906, and 2686 per 10,000 of them were in
the autumn quarter. Winter is the coldest time
of the year for the marrying parson ; only 2337
per 10,000 of the year’s weddings happen then ;
then summer, 2403 ; and spring, 2574. Latterly
the popularity of the autumn wedding has been
even above the average; last year, for instance,
285 of every 1000 weddings happened then, and
only 249 in the spring. There’s no telling for
certain why these things are so. No doubt in a
lot of cases Bill (and Susan) wait till after
harvestin’; in a lot more cases they hurry things
on because Easter is a good time for honey-moon-
ing. But, anyhow, the figures can’t lie, and poets
are enjoined to amend their spring odes accord-
ingly.
CHRISTCHURCH IN THE EVENING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A sound of water by the dusty street,
An open window and a floating song,
And on the evening air a breath of flowers.
Where the dark willows bend above the stream
The lengthened lamp-lights tremble, and the noise
Of echoing footsteps far and farther fails
In whispering silences beyond the bend
Of the wide-sweeping river. Long, straight streets
Stretch on faint-lighted in the growing gloom
Over immeasurable distances
Shut in by trees and houses. Far away
A church clock Chimes the hour, the seven clear strokes
Fainting with silver cadence on the night.
O’er all there breathes a solemn witchery,
And each raw newness of the glaring day
Is toned with velvet shadow. Surely here
The spirit of some ancient city walks
At even-time : and all her palms are dead ;
Ten thousand years ago her music failed ;
Her crumbling palaces are swathed in sand.
But when the lamps are lighted she draws nigh
On golden sandals, and the air is filled
With the soft, subtle magic of her breath.

Upon a corner of the city street,
Where all day long the multitudes press by,
He stands, imported boots upon his feet;
Imported broadcloth on his back ; a high
Silk hat to crown his brow. Self-righteously
His glance is turned towards the passing crowd—
Paint, toiling women, trudging hopelessly,
Child-slaves of Croesus, old men bent and bowed,
Meek publicans, he counts each but a clod,
Removed by kindly fate beyond his ken ;
And lifting up his eyes to Heaven—" Thank God,"
He cries, “ that I am not as other men.”

The House of Representatives having said
“ Yes,” it is now practically settled that a “small com-
mission ” shall be appointed to inquire into the whole
question of insurance in Australia, and report not later
than June 30 of next year. It is far better to put a com-
mission on to the job than a committee of Parliament; for
in Australia there are very few independent actuaries
even outside the House, and none at all within it, and it
will need an actuary of large capacity to handle the
witnesses who will naturally speak for the several life
insurance offices. Every life office has one or more
actuaries connected with it, and presumably there isn’t
one of them who doesn’t believe his method is sound.
The commission will therefore have to be strong enough
to set expert witnesses right where they are wrong.
If there is to be a searching inquiry into the
affairs of every office, it is very doubtful if the job can be
done by the end of June next. Yet nothing less than
that inquiry is called for. The majority of the life offices
are on the mutual principle, and the policy-holders are
therefore interested in knowing what are the weak points
in their organisation. If there are weak points, the
policy-holders will be the people who will suffer. There is
so far no regular State examination of insurance offices in
Australia; and until one thorough examination is made,
the public really will not know to what extent an exami-
nation is necessary. Above all things it is therefore to be
hoped that the affairs of every individual office will be
investigated.
That the result will be very serious for some
offices is highly probable. But that is the very reason
why the investigation should be made—and why it should
be made, too, by men whose report will be tantamount
to a judgment of the High Court. For if the position of
some offices is such that the public will get a shock when
it finds out what that position is, the public can’t too
soon have its eyes opened. Supposing that anybody who
liked had been allowed to practise medicine, it might be
very disastrous to some of the men if an inquiry were
made into their qualifications ; but not to make
an inquiry would very certainly prove a lot
more disastrous to the public. And life insurance is a
matter as to which the public can practically make
no personal inquiry. At the most it says—“ What sort of
bonuses does the office pay ? ” Yet that may be an abso-
lutely rotten test. Bonuses are based entirely on estim-
ates—and everybody knows what sort of things estimates
are. If an office likes to estimate or assume that it will
get 4J per cent, interest, it can declare big bonuses
straight away ; but if a policy-holder lives very long the
chances are that he or his beneficiaries will never draw
them. And there are a hundred other much more deli-
cate little tricks. For instance, an office can assume that
every industrial policy existing will remain in force for a
certain period—a very daring assumption, as anybody
who knows anything at all about industrial insurance
will admit.
The fact, then, is that, if a proper inquiry and
report were made, it might be very difficult thereafter
for some offices to get any business ; in other words,
people are only going to them now because they don’t
know their real weakness. And that is where the State
will be able to come in ; for it should take over the
weakest of these offices, and on that foundation form a
Commonwealth Assurance Department. This would
require no capital; the offices that should be taken over
would be of the mutual type, with perhaps one or two
unimportant exceptions. Proper valuations would, of
course, have to be made, and existing policy-holders
might not perhaps be guaranteed quite all that they are
now led to expect they will get; but the position, so far
as they are concerned, would steadily improve on account
of the great saving of expenses that would at once
follow upon the amalgamation of offices and the stoppage
of much of the present shocking waste. The officers
would have to be considered; many of them would be
Bntirely superfluous. But it would pay the policy-holders
handsomely to make a fair provision on dispensing with
their services.
Something might possibly be done also with
regard to the Australian policies held in foreign offices.
Some of these offices would, no doubt, be very glad to
transfer the whole of their Australian business to the
Commonwealth’s office, and the vast majority of policy-
holders would be glad to be relieved of certain haunting,
though possibly quite unnecessary, doubts and fears.

Treasurer Peake, of South Aus., had a cheerful
tale to tell the Assembly last week. For the year to the
end of June he expected a revenue of £3,095,329, and he
beat his estimate by £559,337. A little surprise like that
is very grateful and comforting, but it suggests things.
When a Treasurer can’t get his estimate closer to the
reality than that, either he doesn’t know much about the
business (and nobody suggests that of A. 11. Peake), or
the State is liable to tremendous ups and downs. And
the State that is liable to downs can’t afford to
take the ups too seriously. In this case, certainly,
the Commonwealth refunds exceeded the estimate
by £175,000; and it is to the credit of S. Aus. that, in
view of those figures, it refused to join in the buzzing
around' the head of the Commonwealth Government.
To a great extent, however, the large Customs collections
were due to the almost phenomenal wave of prosperity
which swept over the State—the wave that is just about
certain to have a trough behind it; in fact, the trough is
already in view, and a good many of the passengers are
suffering even how from that sinking feeling. Also,
owing largely to the boom in metals, and the fact that
S. Aus. is the railway carrier for the Broken Hill mines,
the railway net revenue was £266,000 over the estimate.
So, one way and another, the total revenue was £459,000
ahead of that of the previous year.
The S. Australian expenditure was £3,171,144 ;
so the position for the year was—
Revenue .. .. .. £3,654,666
Expenditure 3,171,144
Surplus .. .. .. £483,522
And for the current year the estimate is—
Revenue .. .. .. £3,380,820
Expenditure .. .. ... ’ 3,308,897
Surplus £71,923
Thus the Treasurer expects to get in £273,846 less than he
got last year, and he expects to spend £137,753 more. The
revenue and the surplus are, however, to the extent of
£40,000 conditional on the passing of some amendments
of the land-tax—proposed last year, but then thrown out
by the House of Landlords, on the ground that the money
wasn’t wanted : a ground which, with the present con-
siderably altered outlook, certainly doesn’t apply now.
The Government’s proposal is to leave undisturbed the
present Jd. in the £ on estates up to £5OOO, but to add
from Jd. up to 3d. on estates varying from £5OOO to over
£lOO,OOO unimproved value. While it is proposed to thus
take £40,000 more from the Fat, it is proposed to take
£26 000 less from the Moderately Lean by raising the in-
come tax exemption from £l5O to £2OO, and making the
exemption apply all round. Hitherto it only applied if
your income was £4OO or under.
Though its record has been smudged by heavy
borrowings, S. Australia has done very good work in
recent years in cleaning up its books. In 1887—about the
blackest period in the State’s history—the accumulated
deficit amounted to £1,108,795 ; and, to push that skele-
ton further back into the cupboard, it was decided to
issue £1,100,000 worth of Treasury bills. At the same
time it was decided that the old drift positively must
stop ; wherefore a sinking fund of i per cent, of the pub-
lic debt was established. It was a case of the sick devil
resolving to be a saint —though a saint in strict modera-
tion. Fortunately, Broken Hill had been discovered just
before this, and first that field, and subsequently the
Westralian goldfields, put S. Australia on its feet ; for,
apart from other things, they opened up new and
highly profitable markets for S. Australian pro-
duce. Still, other deficits dropped in now and then,
and brought up the total to £1,609,545. The whole
of that except £95,451 has been got rid of; and, in
addition, £1,250,590 of a sinking fund has been accumu-
lated. It might, however, be a better sinking fund than
it is ; for, apart from its extreme gradualness, the S. Aus-
tralian Government has the bad habit of using it to
redeem bonds falling due. The essence of a sinking fund
is that it shall go on accumulating by accretions of
interest. Thus when £lOO,OOO of old maturing debt is
paid off out of sinking fund, the State ought to issue a
new lot of bonds for £lOO,OOO to the Public Trustee (S.
Australia has one) or the Sinking Fund Commissioners,
and go on paying interest. Sinking fund interest belongs
to the sinking fund ; and when the sinking fund is used
to wipe out instalments of debt absolutely, it is robbed of
interest to which it is entitled.
S. Australia has had wonderful luck. This
mere handful of people, living in a State which is subject
to violent fluctuations of fortune, had actually under-
taken to repay £6,034,700 within two years. Five years
ago the outlook was nearly pitch-black. The State had
an accumulated deficit of nearly a million ; and it had
only a few thousands in hand towards meeting its I O U
for £6,034,700. Yet even then it is doubtful whether it
realised on what a precipice it was standing. At that
stage a series of remarkable accidents began to happen.
The eastern States had a drought, and S. Australia, which
happened to have a fairly good season, coined money
out of shipments of fodder. On that followed
three excellent seasons and a fair one. Prices
were phenomenally high all round. Surplus followed
surplus. In the other States money was extraordinarily
plentiful. Helped, without a doubt, by the good advice
of the Bank of Adelaide—the bankers to the Government
—S. Australia grasped the opportunity and went on
borrowing steadily in every State of the Commonwealth
except Tasmania. So far, £2,940,100 of the old I O U’s
have fallen due, and £2,532,000 has been paid in cash-
debt transferred from London to Australia. On Janu-
ary 1 next the other £3,094,600 will fall due : £2,000,000
of it was offered the other day in London, and the under-
writers were left with no less than £1,360,000 —a pretty
good indication of the sort of soup S. Australia would
have been in by this time if it had not been for the run of
phenomenal seasons in Australia, and the consequent
ability of S. Australia to raise the money hereabouts.
The amount needed over and above the new loan—a trifle
over a million —will be paid out of the sinking fund and
some small local borrowings. And now, having got out
of a warm corner into which some amazingly foolish
Treasurers of past times had landed it, S. Australia can
take a long breath and then prepare for much the same
sort of thing in 1916-17.

N. S. Wales also spent out of the Public Works Fund
£269,614 as against £221,129, an increase of £48,485. How
much of this ought to be charged to ordinary expendi-
ture there is no way of telling. As the Auditor-General
pointed out in his last report, the fund is being used to
pay for repairs and renewals. This is part of a scheme for
inflating the alleged surplus, because these items ought to
be included with ordinary expenditure. In addition
N. S. Wales spent no less than £563,973 of loan money, or
£196,494 more than it did last year. This is at the rate of
over 2J millions a year. Queensland spent £185,634 of
loan money, as against 1213,624 in the first quarter of
1907-8. The others furnish no information with regard
to their borrowings. As long as they don’t have to pay
cash, their troubles ! An I O U isn’t worth mentioning
apparently.

In the 10 years preceding 1904 the total deficit was
£2,998,698 ; yet on the strength of a couple of fat years,
considerable reductions were made in rates and fares,
especially those in which “ the backbone of the country ”
was most interested. Approximately, these premature
concessions represent £114,000 a year. That they were
premature is further suggested by the large slump in the
surplus, notwithstanding the heavy increase in the ex-
penditure charged to capital account during the year.
This increase in the amount charged to capital account
is shown hereunder: —
1905 £62,341
1906 147,604
1907 159,428
1908 .. 400,015
Of the amount charged to this account during the past
year £77,511 represents the expenditure at Flinders-
street; a large part of the balance was spent on additions
and the strengthening of bridges, etc.—and in such items
it must be almost impossible to draw the line at what is
capital expenditure and what ought to be paid for
out of revenue. Included in capital account is
no less than £714,148 of money Spent on lines
now closed, or on surveys of lines which have
never been built. That is to say, the railways treat as an
asset £714,148 which exists only on paper or in the form
of almost valueless lines. This amount ought to be
steadily written off out of revenue ; and, if it is proposed
to run the railways on business lines, the special conces-
sions should have waited until this squaring-up had been
completed.
The St. Kilda and Brighton street tramway
is worked in conjunctioh with the Victorian railways,
and its accounts are incorporated with the railway ac-
counts. Its two-years’ history has been as follows :

1908 .. 10,374 10,988 2140 2754
In the first year, £9941 was also spent to replace rolling
stock, etc., destroyed by fire, and in the past year £3311 ;
in the published statement these amounts are added to
the outgoings. Moreover, in the past year £2338 is
charged to working expenses on account of rolling stock,
as against £BlO in 1900-7 ; and both that and the heavy in-
crease in the power account call for some explanation. On
the face of it, it looks as though the position with regard to
this one State tramway might have been presented in a
much more favorable light. Presumably the new insur-
ance fund which has been established will cover this
tramway as well as the railways. From June 30 one-half
per cent, of the railway revenue is to be paid into a fund
to meet claims arising out of accident, etc. On June 30
the amount at credit was £45,086 —in which the Sunshine
disaster will bore a hole so large that there isn’t likely to
be any fund left.

It is about time the daily papers—several of
them are sinners—dropped the standing wool-market
heading, “Prices Firm.” The only justification for it is
the state of the market with regard to good merinos.
They keep their price fairly well; but all other sorts have
suffered a further fall of from 5 to 10 per cent, during the
last month. And, unfortunately, when the bulk of this
season’s clip isn’t faulty it is very faulty. Of last season’s
wool held over the biggest percentage was defective ; it
was the good that commanded the limited sales. And
that disproportion of poor sorts in the held-over stocks is
playing the mischief with the market now, especially as
a bigger proportion than usual of this season’s clip is also
short-stapled or otherwise faulty. '

1908 .. 8,979 17,102 62,950
The amount written off is the sum spent on new office
premises. There is really no obvious reason why it should
be treated like that; still the whole cost is charged to
the year’s profit and loss account. Further, £l7lB,
“defalcations,” is also included with the year’s expenses.
Partly on that account, partly because the year’s ordinary
expenses have been larger than usual, the profit shows
considerable shrinkage. The revenue was, however, well
sustained. This revenue is derived mainly from two
sources—-commission and charges (as in the case of a pri-
vate trustee concern), and surplus from investments.
The latter marks the main difference between this office
and the private trustee co. If the Public Trustee is
appointed trustee, and the investment of the interest-
bearing funds is left to his discretion, the State guarantees
both capital and interest. TJie rate of interest is, how-
ever, fixed only from time to time. A man thus knows
when he make's his will, and appoints the Public Office
his trustee, that, unless the State goes broke, his bene-
ficiaries will be sure of their principal. As to the in-
terest, that varies.
The Office could guarantee a certain rate of
interest too ; but, as it would have to look many years
ahead, a substantial insurance fund would be necessary.
Moreover, it could only assume a low rate of interest,
just as a life-assurance office does. Any surplus, or pro-
bably 80 per cent, of the surplus (allowing the other 20
per cent, to go to an insurance or guarantee fund), could
then be divisible among beneficiaries as a bonus, which
would be exactly the same system as insurance offices
adopt. The time is certainly pretty near when trustee
companies will have to do a bit more for their
money. They make very big profits now in pro-
portion to their capital, and they risk practically
nothing. If they invest in mortgages the money may be
lost, but it isn’t their loss so long as they have a couple
of valuations to support them ; and, somehow, even the
best of property valuations, or what ought to be the best,
have a bad habit of sometimes panning out very badly,
Insurance offices practically guarantee their clients’ in-
vestments, both interest and principal; and the time will
come when the trustee office will have to do the same
thing. The Maoriland office goes more than half-way in
that direction now. It guarantees the principal, and it
'guarantees interest, but it only fixes the interest from
time to time, placing the guaranteed return as near the
full market value of money as it dares. The surplus goes
towards guaranteeing it against probable or possible
future losses. In the past year or two its sources of revenue
have been :

Commissions .. £13,784 j £l5 702 (- £15.815 £18,212
Valuation fees, etc. .. 804) ’ / 1,023 1,141
Surpluses .. .. 17,797 16,827 15,688 14,704
The last line further helps to explain the gradual shrink-
ao-e in profits. It must beTeinembered, when looking at
the size of those surpluses, that the money has to serve
as a guarantee fund, ensuring the return of principal ;
and it doesn’t take a very big slump to knock £30,000 or
£5O 000 off a million pounds’ worth of mortgages. Even
British Consols fell from 90J at the beginning of 1906 to
82J in September, 1907.
Besides looking after private estates the Maori-
land Trust Office manages the inadequate Maoriland
sinking fund and all other public trust funds—such as
the police provident fund, the coal miners’ relief fund,
the railways superannuation fund, and the native
reserves. All intestate estates it handles as a matter of
law, as well as those of persons declared insane ; and the
general results are so satisfactory that the N.S.W.
Auditor-General in his last annual report warmly recom-
mended the establishment of a similar office in the Ma
State. If the Ma State won’t, then there is all the larger
chance for a Commonwealth office, which, from many
points of view, would be likely to give far more satis-
factory results. For, as was shown only a few months
ago, a trustee office in S. Aus., no matter how good its
reputation, is barred from acting as trustee in the estate
of a person who dies at, say, Broken Hill, just over the
S. Australian border in N. S. Wales. A Commonwealth
office would get over that difficulty, among others.

The undertaking began with a deficit of £29,508 repre
senting preliminary expenses (cost of raising loans,
removing gas mains, etc.). Subsequently certain patent
rights and other similar paper assets were secured ; and,
though in the past two years £3215 has been written off,
£29,817 still remains to be disposed of. The amount
shown above as written off has been appropriated like

The net revenue account for the past year shows that
£19,567 has'been actually paid as interest. But there is
also an appropriation of £2619 “ to meet accrued interest
on loans on which no accrued interest had been charged
to the end of the financial year in which such loans were
raised.” Apparently interest is payable on June 30 and
December 31 and previously the interest had only been
charged against revenue up to the latter date. Thus
£2619 of the Interest debited for this past year ought to
have been debited against previous years.
The depreciation charged against profits is at the
rate of 2f p.c. on permanent way, electrical equipment, and
such other capital expenditure ; and a very moderate 4
per cent, on preliminary expenses (altering telephone and
electric light lines, cost of raising loans, etc.), linking
fund contributions are at the rate of 1 per cent., with, of
course, the accumulating interest. The loan liabilities
amount to £463,423. Against that the sinking fund now
amounts to £11,896, and unappropriated profit amounts
to £5325 ; total £17,221. And against depreciation of per-
manent way, equipment, etc., there is a reserve of £30,253
—really a renewal reserve. General repai rs have, of course,
been charged so far, along with maintenance, as ordinary
working expenditure. This item will naturally grow as
the equipment, etc., get more venerable, and as it grows
profit will to the same extent diminish. In 1906 the total
was £1705 ;in 1907, £9383 ; in 1908. £14,130. Later on,
however, when large repairs become necessary the depre-
ciation reserve will be drawn upon. The situation at
present is that, after providing interest, and paying for
all current repairs, and providing £13,859 towards future
renewals, and putting by £4858 to wipe out the capital
debt, the undertaking in the past year made £4086. Of
that amount £1467 was added to reserves, and £2619 was
set aside to pay interest for the extra three months as
described above.

Except as to the amount added to reserves and the total
amount of reserves the figures for 1907 have had to be
partly estimated. Something more than £2OOO may have
been written off ; if more was written off, then the gross
profits were to that extent greater. The co.’s warehouse
premises were burned just after the year ended, and as the
stock of stationery went up in smoke no copy of the balance-
sheet was available. Partly as a result of that trouble,
but mainly on account of the very heavy liabilities,
further shares have been issued —a few ordinary shares
and 5414 pref. £5 shares. Two years ago the paid capital
was £lOO,OOO ;it is now £127,765. Meantime the liabili-
ties have been reduced from £90,757 to £69,332 ; so that
while £27,765 of capital has been got in, £21,425 of debt
has been paid off. The balance, along u'lth £BOB2
of book debts got in, has gone towards payments
on account of new warehouse property (£16,524). The
book debts are now £30,189, as against £38,271 two years
ago.. Part of the improved profit is due to the reduction
of debt, and, consequently, interest; as against that,
ordinary shareholders have, of course, to take the new
preference issue into account. The £2.7,070 which has
been raised in that way is still a debt so far as they are
concerned- Another part of the improvement in the look
of the profits is no doubt due to the lower price of wool.
Stock stands at £113,685 ; and that is necessarily a
matter of valuation or estimate. If, for instance, wool
went on falling, possibly something considerable might
have to be written off that item. There are large risks in
the business—larger risks than there need be or than
there would be if the Protection against foreign shoddy
goods were higher. Nevertheless, assuming that stock is
not over-valued in view of the weak wool market, and
considering the trouble which occurred early in the year
and the inevitable dislocation of business, the years
results are very satisfactory, and the general position is
distinctly improved. # # *
The Barrier Tramway Co. is to be wound up in
Adelaide. It never had a tramway ; all it managed to
get was a select committee of the N.S.W. Leg. Council,
which reported in favor of its bill, but on the second read-
ing it could only muster three supporters—which shows
how farcical the N.S.W. select committee system is.
There was absolute want of confidence in the, Barrier
Tramway Co. What it aimed at was a concession to build
a railway, connecting Broken Hill and the S. Australian
line, via Pinnacles ; but it hadn’t the money. In short,,
it wanted a concession to sell, wherefore Parliament
threw it out, on the ground that it hadn t
shown enough evidence of bona fides. And no
doubt quite a lot of people in the House were
all the more eager to do that because, if an accident hap-
pened and the money was raised to build the line, it
would compete with that mighty bit of 60 per cent.
Private Enterprise, the Silverton Tramway Co. In fact,
some people suspected that, if the Bill were passed, that
co. would find some way to stop the competing rails being
laid ; and, though the promoters probably never thought
of such a thing, some people who bought Barrier Tramway
Co.’s shares during their very short-lived boom in Ade-
laide reckoned upon at least making a few P°u nds
blackmailing way. But the collapse of the Bill spoiled
it all.

Very soon the Broken Hill tug-of-war on the
wages question will begin, and the opposing teams of
miueowners and men are now getting their feet set in trie
cleats. One difficulty in the way of a settlement is the
inequality of the contract system. It is owing to this
inequality that both sides are able to use such apparently'
convincing arguments tending towards diametrically
opposite conclusions. The men say' the present
system of setting contracts mostly favors the mine-
owners, and renders it possible for good workmen
to make a miserable ss. or less per shift. me
managers, on the other hand, point to the frequency
with which 15s. per shift is earned in stopes, Winzes, etc. ,
not in one mine, but right along the line of lode. Ihat
the average may be 12s. or 13s. per shift does not in the
least mollify the man who strikes a run of bad luck and
whose earnings week after week pan out at about Bs. per
shift. A reduction, be it ever so small, is regarded as
serious by such a man, and he is naturally inclined to
fight tooth and nail against it. To show how'
very difficult is the task of holding the balance
evenly between the contractor and the co., an
instance may be given. Two parties were working on
contract—both lots stoping ore—in the one mine.
The earnings of one party averaged 15s. a shift per man,
while the other party was making only 9s. per man. me
low-paid party complained to the shift-boss, and the fol-
lowing fortnight a fresh deal was made, the two parties
changing places. The result was that the party which
had been making 15s. a shift in its old place increased its
earnings to £1 per man, and the dissatisfied party wa.
not able to knock out the 9s. it had earned in the old
stope. These are the inequalities no conference will
be able to satisfactorily adjust. Some of them arise
from inequalities in the men ; others arise from ie
rapid changes which occur in the character of the ore.
Tn the concentrating mills of the Barrier,
fashions come and go. A little while back nearly every
millman along the line of lode became enamored of the
grinding-pan, and the implement passed through various
modifications, till everyone’s individual taste was suited.
Then somebody said “ tube mills,” and before long near y
every mill superintendent was dancing as gracefully as
might be to the new tune. The B. H. Prop, has just
picked four of the kind it likes best, and the South mine
has had them in use for some time past. The south
Blocks hasn’t room for one yet, and the Junction North
can’t afford one ; but the craze is evidently spreading.
An even-grade material is one of the great desiderata in
concentration, and the hunt for means to accomplish this
is at present occupying a deal of attention in Broken Hill.
Sanguine shareholders in the Broken Hill South
Blocks got a severe shock when, a couple of months ago,
the annual report came out alleging a net profit for the
term of only £332. It w'as mighty little to show' for an out-
put of 88,999 tons of sulphides, besides a few tons of car-
bonates ; and it was worse still considering that lead had
averaged £l6 os. 7d. per ton during the 12 months. The
fact, of course, was that, seeing that the money wasn t
available—in fact, the directors had just been obliged to
tap the Lake View Consols Co. for a loan—it struck
the Board as ridiculous and misleading to declare
a profit of anv size ; wherefore the directors wrote
off the £29,234 that had been spent during the year on
development, equipment, etc. Down to June 30 this co.
had in two years spent £80,275 on this account, and it
has written off all but £47,554. This of course, will
make things easier for the management during the next
few years - having written off this expenditure once, the co.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating’ mills and workshops, ever} 7 small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

After conducting exhaustive tests in the con-
centration of the ores at the Broken Hill South mine, the
manager, Mr. Wainwright, has finally decided to instal
the Wilflev type of table, modified in the direction best
adapted to his particular local requirements. The great
advantage with this type of table is that it admits of so
many slight variations which adapt it to meet all classes
of pulverised ores. Provided the pulp for treatment is
graded it can be used to treat all varieties of ore from
slimes up to coarse grades. When treating slimes and
lightly mineralised ores, care must be taken to have the
slope of the table accurate, and a fine, smooth dressing
surface beyond the feather edged diagonal termination of
the rifHes. When treating coarsely ground ores or ores
heavily charged with mineral, as at the Broken Hill South,
the riffles or grooves can be carried further along the table
and in some instances right up to the concentrates dis-
charge end. Mr. Wainwright ordered six tables as an
experiment, with fewer riffles or grooves than customary,
and with some of tnem —the lower ones—carried to the
extreme end of the table. So successful has this type of
Wilfley table proved that he has ordered 50 more from
the Austral Otis Engineering Company. This same firm
has been placing several of the patent Callow Screens at
Broken Hill and elsewhere. This ingenious and simple
mechanism has solved the problem of grading prior to
concentration.* rg

by a series of tunnels. The Railway Commissioners, who
are carrying out this work, have ordered eight Reavell

The greedy landlord stands enemy to many

an agricultural writer in Sydney Telegraph that
“ Horse-breeding on a large scale, such as to be of
any value to the military authorities, is only
possible when the land is cheap.” Heaven knows
land ought to be cheap enough in Australia, with
so many thousands of acres lying idle, if the land

When the South Blocks chairman talked like a
father to the shareholders in the middle of July,
he told them a very different yarn from the one
they would be likely to pick up from the annual report,
even though they did take into account the things men-
tioned above. He said that if their mill could handle
8500 tons a month at 14s. per ton, and could get 78 per
cent, of the lead out of an ore going 16'5 per cent., then
with lead at £l2los. per ton and silver at 26d. per oz. the
co. could make £1750 a month profit. Figures for three
months are now available. The average monthly output
has been 8687 tons, or better than Chairman Govett bar-
gained for. The working costs have been a fraction under
13s. 6d. per ton—also better than the price Govett based
his figures on. The extraction has been 7S'2 per cent.,
and the ore has averaged 16 - 5 per cent. Whether
Govett’s estimate of profit was sound or not can’t be said
for certain ; but, anyway, the conditions are panning out
better than those on which he told shareholders they
would get a profit of £1750 a month. And lead is well
over his £l2 10s., and silver is about on the mark he
named, assuming that he meant fine silver when he
quoted 2s. 2d. per oz. Costs are extraordinarily low :
mining last month ran to only 6s. lOd. per ton. But
development ran into another Is. 3d. ; and that might
just as well be added first as last. Construction account
absorbed another 3s. 9d. per ton. That is the trouble with
so many of these pretty estimates relating to profits.
They are built in exactly the same way as the average
State Treasurer builds his surpluses—l)y omitting to
charge a whole host of things to working expenses. Yet
the money you call profit, but which you have to spend
on shafts or winzes or machinery, might just as well be
called something else for all the dividend you can get
out of it. Still, giving that all in, the South Blocks mine
has made wonderful progress, and is probably making as
much profit per ton out of its silver and "lead as any
mine at Broken Hill. Unfortunately it will never get
much help from its zinc; but there are 1 compensations
even with regard to that.

Sydney shareholders, who own such a big bundle
of the shares in the Hillgrove Prop. (N.S.W.), met again
early this week, and expected to be told that the proposed
inspection of the mine by A. E. Savage and J. W. Ash-
croft—now, bj' the way, partners in a Sydney business—
could proceed at once. To the astonishment of some of
them they found that not even a cable on the subject had
been sent to the London office owing to the stone-broke-
ness of the co. at this end. Under those circumstances
all that the Sydney shareholders could do was to put up
the money to pay for the report; and on that report will
very largely depend whether the shareholders put up
more money or let themortgagees(debenture-holdersand
others) struggle with the disastrously-financed show.
From Baker’s Creek. 310 tons returned 6890 z.
gold, which included 160 oz. from the periodical clean-
up of the plates. This mine is economically managed,
and in that respect is a contrast to its neighbor next door.
Baker’s Creek management wasn’t the sort to spend
thousands to get over a difficulty with the firewood
carting in wet weather. Even in the matter of
development work they are trying to find out
what the prospects are below No. 18 in order
to shape out a scheme of development. Chasing
a thin streak of golden stone down to 2000 ft. requires
good management, if operations are to be made to pay.
Development work on a footwall branch of Smith’s reef
is giving fair results. The co. is well-off for cash, and if
there is an improved outlook for the deep levels, it will
help to lift the generaMepression at Hillgrove.
The Colon Peaks and other mines at Burra-
gorang and Yerranderie (N.S.W.) have been shutdown,
and the miners in that district are in a bad way. All the
shows are small, and mostly contain narrow, rich veins.
While the lead market boomed and silver was up in sym-
pathy, a few of them made good profits; but silver is
nearly 6d. per oz. cheaper now, and the smelters’ charges
have also gone up, so the mines are hit both ways. The
little mine, as a rule, comes out of a metal slump worse
than a big mine. The latter nearly always has some
patches of rich ore, which in ordinary times it uses for
“ sweetening,” and on which it can draw more freely
when things get desperate ; while, if it works at all, the
little mine has to work during a slump on just the same
class of ore as it worked before—it isn’t big enough to
allow of picking and choosing.

Mt. David (N.S.W.) crushed 380 tons stone for
1660 z. ; 21oz. from the Huntingdon mill and 550 z. from
340 tons of tailings. The tonnage (and it’s low-grade
stone) is small for such a big co., yet it seems as if an in-
creased output will have to wait until the new shaft is
down and the mine opened up more extensively.
* ■* •* *
"Charters Towers reports—“ Mexicans the only-
live stock on the market.” Brilliant Extended crushed
5000 tons for £11,114. Profit is estimated at £4lOO, in
which case costs must have comedown with a crash from
£2 a ton. Word also comes that the Bonnie Dundee has
a credit of £3117, with a big crushing going through ; but
as far as can be made out the profit at the close of the
half-year was £1631, arid to make up a credit of £3117
unexpended call money and £BO7 from forfeited shares
has been included, so the £3117 doesn’t represent working
profit. The Queen Cross is to reconstruct, and share-
holders are allowed three months to pay up the first
3d. on 200,000 shares. As a pioneer of deep ground, the
Cross is asking for something out of the mining vote.
On the strength of results obtained by deep boring the
shaft is being sunk below 2000 ft.
East Mexican, Charters Towers, has had another
good crushing. The first contract for driving No. 6
level from the boundary is completed ; the heavy mineral
stone taken out has produced about £2500 worth of gold.
So far, No. 6 has proved very much better than the level
above, which has had hard ground and a narrow, erratic
reef to contend with. No. 6 has also proved fully twice as
rich per foot driven as the level below, (No. 7, N. B. Free-
hold), so the fears about the varying character of the reef
had some foundation. But the very fact that conditions
change so often is the food the sanguine punter lives on.
All four levels in the N. B. Freehold are on profitable
stone, and sinking the main shaft has been commenced ;
but it takes it all to hold up the exceedingly dull market,
which shows prices that are still a long way ahead of
developments. Mills’ United, which is acting the good
foster-mother to the Mexican and the N. B. Freehold, has
lately had an improvement in No. 10, west of the big
slide, and the rich block of ground in the upper levels is
helping to maintain quarterly dividends (£15,000).
It transpired at the inquest on the bodies after
the recent bad accident at Mount Morgan that numerous
big falls had occurred since the underground quarry
system was introduced in place of the square-set system ;
in fact, there had been two previous falls at the 750 ft.
workings. If these falls are frequent, then it is obvious
that the underground quarry system is not the proper
one. If the ground will stand, well and good ; there is
no need to waste money on timber in that case. But the
only Justification for doing without timber is that the
ground will stand without it. There certainly seems
room for inquiry into the alleged frequency of the falls.
The rather more expensive square-set system might not
in the long run prevent the heaviest of them, but the
timbers would gradually feel the weight, and would
“ talk,” thus giving warning of danger.

September was the best month Gympie (Q.)
has had for a long time, and the old field was quite lavish
of church money with half-a-dozen thrippenny dividends.
During the month 12,516 tons were crushed arid £12,895
paid in divs. No. 2 S. threat Eastern has been getting
good stone from No. 3 reef, and, after much doubt and
tribulation, has completed a century of dividends. The
output will be increased, as more men have been put on.
The. co. has £3OOO on fixed deposit, so if No. 3
and the Inglewood reefs continue to shape
well there should be another dividend before
Christmas. South Glanmire and Monldand is also
on the Inglewood, with rather poor returns ; the work-
ings have not yet entered favorable black slate country.
Columbia Extended keeps a battery of 10 head at work ;
the last crushing was 313 tons for 4020 z. This line is
much fancied on the strength of the specimen stone ob-
tained in No. 2 North Columbia. No. 1 crushed 288 tons for
2720 z., and No. 3 has struck gold-bearing' formation.
East Oriental is driving on good stone to the south ; 1505
tons (with some specimens from the show-case) returned
1085 oz. smelted gold. The mine is cheaply worked, and
four dividends amounting to Is. 4d. per share have been
paid. This development knocks out the theory that the
eastern ground is valueless. But, then, Gympie makes a
shuttlecock of theory.
* * ■* *
A crushing of 1000 tons from the Vulcan (N.
Queensland) gave 60 tons of tin concentrates valued at
£3300, or a gross average leturn of £3 6s. per ton. That
is better, and will help the co. to go on with its big
scheme of development. Otherwise some of the uncalled
Is. 2d. per share might have been asked for. There are
264,000 shares.

A rumor has been circulating that Shepherd, of
the O.K. (North Queensland), was leaving ; the circum-
stantial tale was told that he was going back to Mt.
Morgan, presumably to follow the late and lamented
11. P. Seale. Apart from the fact that mining isn’t Shep-
herd’s specialty, O.K. directors declare that they, anyway,
know nothing of such an intention.

A water-jacket furnace is being substituted for
the reverb, at the Anaconda copper mine (W. A.). During
the past 12 months £44,000 has been taken out of this
property, and now that the supplies of oxidised ore are
getting short and the sulphides do not lend themselves
to the old method of smelting, the change alluded to is
being made. The present intention is to smelt 1000 tons
a month at the mine and to refine the low-grade product
at Fremantle.
* * * *
Garden Gully (W.A.) has just treated 300 tons
for an average of 2dwt. This is the mine from which four
tons of “ golden stone ” were alleged to have been stolen,
about a year ago, and which has since given a succession
of poor returns. Thera was a suspicion at the time that
the yarn about the robbery was spread in order that
shareholders and the public would blame the workmen
and not the mine for the wretchedly poor returns that
were inevitable. The management still, however, pro-
fesses to have faith in the property.
* * * *
Someone has been induced to find more cash for
the development of the Boulder Main Reef, and this,
coupled with heavy local buying, has put the shares up a
bit. The present intention is to go down deeper and
then open out again, meantime allowing tributors to look
for something near the surface. The mine has some
speculative value on account of its past record and close
proximity to the Boulder arid Horseshoe; but not as
much as the present quotation indicates.
Shareholders were told at the Paringa meeting
that the Kalgoorlie property was best left alone for
the time being, and that a tight hold was being kept on
the remaining capital in the hope that something better
would turn up. An attractive proposal was said to be
before the Board, and if it proves to be as good as it
looks, shareholders are to be asked to come "along and
say what they think of it.
J. H. Curie’s opinion of the Burma mines, in
which the Lake View Consols Co. has sunk a good deal of
hard cash : “ In the flotation, too little cash was provided
for building the railway... Those in control, no doubt,
thought that for a 2ft. line, merely to run down 115,000
tons of slag, any sort of makeshift would do, and they'
provided accordingly. They forgot that the whole dis-
tance was through hilly country' and in dense jungle, and
that for several months each year the road-bed and cut-
tings lie under torrential rains. These initial mistakes
cost the co. ay'ear’sdelayin reaching its slags, likewise the
raising of £40,000 further capital for the mere completion
of the line. The transport question is the weak point, but
it does, not appear insuperable. Local tradition says the
mines have not been worked for 60 years, then perhaps dis-
continuously. I should imagine the days of their splendor
toihave been several hundred years ago. The fact to
grasp now is that there are some 55,000 tons of lead (in
the form of 48 per cent, lead slags) ready to ship, and the
co. expects to begin this work late in 1908. With good
prices for lead and the finding of pay ore under the old
workings the mines ought to be a successful venture.”
No doubt; assuming good prices and pay ore, quite a lot
of things would he successful ventures.
* * * *
Cathcart, Ararat (Vic.), knocked off 90 men
without an official word being known in Melbourne till
the blow fell. The Smelbourne Board says it knew no-
thing. Yet the local directors must have been mere
drifters of the first water if, perceiving that shares were
slipping downhill, they' did not try to get at the reason.
The Bulletin has, more than once, told all and sundry
what is happening at the Cathcart. First, the ground is
heavy and swells, so that work, besides being costly, can-
not be hurried. Next, the wash drains slowly. Further,
the lead is narrow', and, unless a big length of ground
is drained, the mine won’t stand a big staff.
The drives across the lead go at intervals of
200 ft. There never has been 500 ft. of wash properly
drained to operate on, and there never was any reason
for putting on 10 parties. Costs were all right as long as
even partly-drained ground was available, but, after that
boundary was passed, and although oz. dirt was being
stoped, it cost nearly the gold contents to take the wash
out. Chairman Dodds and the Ararat people formerly
fired abuse at Bewick, Moreing and Co. What about
their own shortcomings, and the promised divs. ? As it
is, the mine will have to pretty well stand idle for three
months.
* * * *
Ballarat has done a little better with its gold
output for the quarter, 41,900 tons having given
11,675J0z., or an average of sJdwt. per ton. This com-
pares with 36,082 tons treated in the April-June quarter
for 10,374j0z., or an average of sdwt. 13gr. After all,
it is a poor lot, only £2900 coming as divs. from the
41,900 tons treated. Ballarat East, moreover, provided
all the profits, mining in other parts of the district being
in a deplorable state.
* * « *
Bad news comes from the Plateau, Ballarat :
South Star is throwing up the sponge so far as deep work
goes. This means that a large portion of the Bent grant
of £5OOO won’t be wanted, as it had been intended to use
the money to test the country out to the east. The
general taxpayer won’t complain, because he has no
belief in deep Plateau mining', as he judges by the poor
results got at below 1600 ft. Star of the Bast and Central
PlaiteaU, next door, will now feel the pinch, because it
takes the combined pumping efforts of the three to keep,
the water down. South Star will try its luck at the tippler
levels. ; What with the fear of flooding from the old lead
near the surface and the scratching out done below, more
than the ordinary mining risk has to be faced. The posi-
tion to-day is that 10 years of deplorable mining at the
Sebastopol Plateau have decided investors as to the poverty
of the ground, 1

“ Yea,st,” from Pt. Darwin : Itis no use miners
coming here at present. Take the West Arm, for
instance. Five claims are being worked, but only two
are employing labor—the Northern Queen (three white,
miners at 11s. Bd. per shift, which is the recognised white
miner’s wage) and the Mona, owned by a local syndicate,
employing five white miners and four white surface hands
(wages 11s. and 9s. 6d. respectively), along with 25 to 30
Chows. Several other claipis are being, worked by their
owners, who are struggling along. (Want of capital to
contend with the water is a great drawback. There are
some good claims which would pay well if they only had
the machinery and pumping gear; for the deeper
the lode the better the tin. There is a gold claim on
West Arm owned by a local syndicate, and known as
the Golden Boulder; to this the Government has given
£5OO to help develop the mine. That £5OO is going in
finding work for Chows, w'hile there are dozens of whites
out of work. Premier Price, when in England, said that
John Bull should not lend money to Germany to build
battleships. But how about his own Government lending
(or giving) money to a syndicate to employ Chinese? All
hands employed by the Government here are supposed to
get a “ tropical allowance,” but the only ones that get it
are those who sit in their offices for a few hours a day.
As regards the climate, those who are living on the
Chinese are about the only ones that run it down), and say
that white men can’t work here. They don’t want whites
to come along and upset things.

Wunderlich, Limited, well and favorably known
throughout! Australia as makers of steel ceilings and steel
walls, and art workers in metals, opened new offices at the
works at Redfern (Sydney), on Monday last. The building,
as befits an artistic firm, is elegant, ornate, and made more
beautiful by being largely composed and altogether
decorated with materials made in the firm’s own work-
shops. Great sheets of steel were stamped into designs
by gigantic steel hammers, and the whole piece after-
wards painted and decorated by machinery for the
edification of the visitors, who, having had their
mouths opened by the simplicity and beauty of the
process, were then taken to where there was some induce-
ment for them to close their lips again on a good dinner.
The managing director told the story of the works, and
said that, although they had grown under Freetrade con-
ditions, they had flourished under Protection. What
struck his hearers most was the announcement that, owing
to Protection, the firm had been enabled to reduce prices
—the turn-over had increased so that, in proportion to
output, they were able to cut expenses considerably—and
that it paid to reduce the price of the products to make
them more popular.

The editor of a small trade weekly published in
London was lately asked to supply an Australian syndi-
cate with an estimate of the cost of placing a new product
on J. Bull’s market in an impressive manner. The reply
was an interesting study in the rapacity of professional
floaters. For the printing of 100,000 prospectuses only
£2OO would be charged, but the issuing- of them would
cost another £3OB 6s. Bd.—which is a strictly legal-look-
ing estimate. Solicitors’ charges, including registration
fees, would tot up to £llOO. Advertising would amount
to £4OOO, and altogether a draft for £5618 6s. Bd. would
be required by the agents, who for that money undertook
to give the product a proper announcement to the British
public. Needless to say that the £4OOO of advertising
would be put into the hands of the combined firms who
have somehow got an octopus grip of the business in
England.

drumming of the anopheles like unto the cries of souls
in Purgatory. I dream weird dreams. Wake up to find
a “boy” in my room. He says, “One fellow wild pig
been come inside fence and eatem tlousers belonga you
I wash to-day, no dry, leave him Tonga line, pig he find
’em.” Swear some, and urge the savage from my pre-
sence. Sleep again, and then : “ Master, master, coffee
he stop,” and another day begins.
WHEN PIGS FLY.
“ Mother , can I go for a fly with the butcher?”
“ F. Melton’s ” tribute :
Re Arabs. Am working at present on a Paroo station,
where most of the horses are by an Arab stallion out of
ordinary station mares. After several years’ experience
of station hacks, would rather have these than any others.
They are very docile, sound on their feet, hardy, have no
vice, and are good walkers. In addition, they are beauti-
fully easy and free to ride—a point that is appreciated
when riding 30 or 40 miles daily.
“Silas Snell ” : My Gippsland friend was
philosophising on the strange delight some men
take in fighting. “You meet blokes knockin’
round, he said, “who’ll take more trouble to get
into a scrap than the average man takes bewitchin’
a female. There was Matty Clark, for instance.
Matty would walk 20 miles on the off-chance of
gettin’ a punch on the nose, and his only interest
m a stranger lay in the possibility of the newcomer
wantin to have a few rounds with him. And
yet Matty was no great fighter ; as often
as not he got badly done up, and once
he was in hospital a month after
hittin’ the new butcher in the eye.
I reirember particularly his
trouble with Treeleaf. One
day I was ridin’ in from
Bluebrook, when I come
across Clark sittin’ on a
log, patiently nursin’ his
foot. On the grass near
by lay a total stranger.
Clark explained.
‘ See this ’ere bloke? ’
be said. ‘His name’s
Treeleaf. He was
knockin’ round, say-
in’ he was willin’V
take me on, but
when I ’eard of it
he was blue blin’.
I’m waitin’fer him
to sober up.’ I left
them there,” con-
tinued the Gipps-
lander, “but heard
next day that Tree-
leaf had been ar-
rested while lyin’
drunk off the road,
and was run in for
stealin’ thirty shill-
in's out of Carter’s
till. Treeleaf got si x
months, and when he
came out Matty Clark
was waitin’ at the gaol
gates. ‘Hi, mate,’ said
Matty, ‘what about that
fight?’ But the Salvation
Prison Gate Brigade spirited
Treeleaf away, and he stayed
in their home for a week.
Clark heard of him being out,
and looked him up again, but
Treeleaf had a poisoned hand,
and Clark lost sight of him for a
year or more, when they came to-
gether at Harry Franks 5 funeral at
Bluebrook. Matty could hardlv
wait for the decent finish of the ob-
sequies afore he was at Treeleaf about
the postponed mill. Treeleaf was willin’,
and we went over at the back of the ceme-
tery, and saw Matty get such a gran’father of a
hidin’ that he had to be carried home in the chief
mourners’ American waggon, bedded down on the
coats of the other followers of the remains of the
late lamented. X never saw a man so disgusted as
Clark was when he heard a week later that Tree-
leaf had gone to Sydney. He owed him a return
battle, he said.”
Harry Stockdale side-tracks the Arab :
Ex-Justice Boucaut alleges (B. 24/9/’08) that I supplied a
most misleading environment for the Arab horse when I
said that for 1400 or 1500 years he had lived in flat, sandy
country. Professor Ridgeway, of Cambridge University,
supported by numbers of other learned men, maintains’
that the Arabs possessed no horses of any kind until after
the birth of Christ, and probably not before the third or
fourth century after that. Lady Anne Blunt, whom Mr.
Boucaut himself quotes as a foremost authority, and from
whose stud the foundation of the Quambi stud was pur-
chased, speaking of the country near the stud of the
Emir Mohammed Ibn Rashid (the far-famed Nejd horses),
says : “To understand it rightly, one ought to consider
what Arabia is, and what the Arab character and mode of
life. The whole of the Peninsula, with the exception,
perhaps, of Yemen, and certain districts of Hadramant,
within the influence of the monsoon winds, is a rainless,
waterless region—in every sense of the word a desert.
The soil is a poor one, mainly of gravel or of sand, and,
except in a few favored spots, unsuited for cultivation ;
indeed, no cultivation is possible at all in Nejd, except
with the help of irrigation, and, as there is no water
above ground, of irrigation from wells. Even wells are
rare. The general character of the central plateaux, and
of the Peninsula, is that of vast uplands of gravel, as
nearly destitute of vegetation as any in the world. The
desert surrounds them like a sea.” 'Mrs. Burton, wife of
the celebrated explorer, says: “The famous mares are
kept in the desert.” Mr. Boucaut finally claims the Arab
to be “the grandest horse humanity has yet known.”
But is this absolutely correct ? As an enthusiast, he no
doubt fully believes the Arab to be matchless. But,
though I am an admirer of that animal, and a firm
believer in his courage and stoutness, very desirable
qualities in any good horse, I am not prepared to admit
his claim to such a proud position. Some capable
judges of horse flesh have set down the Arab as very in-
ferior. Personally, I cannot overlook the fact that nearly
all our most famous horses trace back to the imported
Arabs and Barbs.
* * * *
“Quan”: jRe the speed, endurance, and
weight-carrying powers, and the soundness of the
legs and feet of the Arab horse. Writing re-
cently about his well-known charger, Vonolel,
Lord Roberts said :
I bought the horse in Bombay in 1877. He was a pure-
bred Nejd Arab, and was then five years old, and had
quire recently been landed from Arabia. The following
year I took him to Afghanistan, where he was with me
for two years in extremes of heat and cold, and very
often with difficulties about proper food for him. But
while other horses fell off in condition from not
getting forage, the little Arab maintained his
throughout. I kept him all the time I was in
India, and in 1893 brought him to England. He
attracted great attention at the late Queen’s Jubilee in
1897. He died two years afterwards in Dublin, where I
resided while commanding in Ireland. During the 22
years he was in my possession he travelled with me
over 50,000 miles, and was never sick or sorry. He
measured exactly 14h. 2in.
Another Arab that was in Lord Roberts’ march
from Cabul to Kandahar was Maidan, which
belonged at that time to Colonel Brownlow, of
the 72nd Highlanders. From his second to his
fifth year Maidan was a racehorse. Then till he
was 17 Colonel Brownlow, who weighed 18st. 81b.,
used him as a charger. When his owner was
killed at Kandahar, Maidan was bought by Lord
Airlie, who won many races with him in India.
Subsequently he was sold to the Hon. Eustace
Vesey, who shipped him to England via Marseilles
(France). The voyage occupied 100 days, and
during that time Maidan did not lie down. When
23 and without a blemish, he broke one of his
legs, and was destroyed. He was half an inch
short of 15 hands high.
“ Werrimee ” : Some time ago Mr. F.
Turner, F.L.S., in an address at the Naturalists’
Club, stated that, in his opinion, the most remark-
able trees in Australia were the cream of tartar
(of N. Australia), bottle tree (Queensland), flame
tree (N.S.W.), messmate (Victoria), sugar gum
(S.A.), and the fire tree (Westralia). Which
suggests botanical names for the different Staters
more fitting than some of the terms by which they
are distinguished. Northern Terri-
tory, Cream-o’-Tartars; Queens-
land, Bottle-o’s ; N.S.W., Tree
Blazers; Victoria, Messmates;
S. A., Gumsuckers (usually applied
to natives of Victoria); and Wes-
tralia, Firesticks.

“ Machete ” : Re the Papuan sorcerer
(B. 24/9/’08). Far from being the alleged helpless
old gentleman who is made a victim to the super-
stitions of his fellowmen, and is then gaoled by a
complaisant Government official, the Papuan
“ pourri-pourri man,” to give him his pigeon-
English name, is invariably the most infernal old
villain in the vicinity. The Papuan only recog-
nises the direct and visible means of departure
from this earth, such as the stone club or the
rifles of the native constabulary, or similar
material agencies. Every form of death from
natural causes is consequently the result of be-
witchment—or “poisoning.” The magician, for
instance, will knot a strand of grass across a path
where his “mark ” will break it with his shin.
This done, the victim is supposed to peg out, and
often complies readily. Where pneumonia, or
something of the sort, takes off a member of the
village, the aged and perfidious practitioner takes
full credit for the job. In this way he estab-
lishes a connection that is both lucrative
and extensive without raising a finger in actual
violence. No one who has not experienced it can
credit the terror inspired by some of these old
charlatans. If one of them desires the best pig
or the plumpest maiden he asks for it, and sees
that he gets it. No young man is a “pourri-
pourri” artist, as a rule. It is a weapon in the
hands of the old men, and they guard it very
closely.
* * * *
“ Mallarapoonie ” (ramblingly anent cats) :
Where in this wide continent will ye not find
cats? They are everywhere. Once they were
tame and domesticated. But the march of the
years has rendered them wild—in many cases
dashed wild. I have met Thomas, or the tracks
of Thomas, in the sandy Centralian wastes, in the
tropical scrubs of the Northern Peninsula, and
among the Stokes, the Leichhardt, and the
Grampian Ranges. He prowls in the moonlight
on the shores of Lake Eyre, in the gullies round
Kosciusko, and in the spinifex regions of the
upper He Grey. A hardy, truculent varlet is the
wild Australian Tom—independent, savage, merci-
less, living by stealth and treachery, hating all,
by all well hated. He seems to thrive as well
amid Gippsland snows as in the arid Westralian
deserts. What manner of beast of prey will he
have evolved into by 20,000 A.H. or so? The
first of him seen in the Far Nor’-West was at the
time of the Kimberley rush. Some miners and
their families migrating with vehicles from
Queensland, brought him and his missus into
the Victoria basin. In that land of small, in-
digenous rodents Thomas throve. The natives soon
acquired him, and he became fashionable in the
blacks’ camps along the Nor’-West frontier. The
small niggers got to love him, and would play with
him by the hour on the blazing sand among the wur-
lies. The kids used to carry their cats about by
the tails swung over their fat and ebony shoulders
—till the cats protested by digging their nails into
their owners’ backs. Once, when the old station
cat had kittens in a stockman’s bunk, the boss
tried the experiment of cutting the cats’ tails
short off to euchre the small black nippers in their
portage habits. But when those cats grew up, the
little blacks carried them about by the hind legs
instead. The nigs, are dying off, but the descend-
ants of the cats they carried wax and flourish
mightily. Yes, I should be interested to see the
Australian wild cat of 20,000 A.D. —behind a stout
set of bars.
“H.G.K.”: “Swamper” and “S. W.
Gum” notwithstanding, “Ida F. I).” is nearly
right in her statements regarding nghamma (not
“namma ”) holes and night-wells. One of each I
can vouch for. The first is a night-well situated
about 100 miles from Albany on the inland road
to Phillip River, the peculiarities of which were
described in The Bulletin years ago. The other,
a nghamma hole, is in some flat rocks at a place
called Dhoorty, five miles south of Waigemoottha.
From this hole, which is about 2ft. deep and just
wide enough to allow dipping with a billy-can, I
have known 17 horses watered and thefluid remain
at the same level. The supply is, however, liable
to give out suddenly, but the giving-out seems
to have no definite relation to the amount
of water taken away. In the early ’nineties,
shortly after-a shower of rain which had filled the
shallow depressions in the rocks, I found at the
nghamma hole a German, who, with commend-
able thoughtfulness, essayed to fill it with the
water from the surrounding pools. They would
soon have dried up, and Hans reckoned it
economy to concentrate the supply in one deep
reservoir. Anticipating some fun I returned in
about three-quarters of an hour, and found Hans
with a disgusted look on his face. I inquired
whether he had filled the hole : “ No, no. I hafe
pud in von hondred and dirty-fife dishes, and the
vater haf nod gome bop von inches. Ach, the
dam ting leaks.” I explained the peculiarity of
the hole to him, and staggered him with the in-
formation that if he wanted the water back he
could get it by baling. I may mention, to dis-
prove the soak theory, that the soak waters
around this rock are salt. So what do you make
of that ?
* * * *
“P. Winkle”; There seems to be tan
affinity between snakes and fish in the matter of
plentitude, and vice versa! Have noticed on the
Big Trickle —especially about the notorious Snake
Island and the Moira Lakes—that when fish are on
the bite snakes are around at every turn. When
cod are taking the lines freely, tiger-snakes and
copper-bellies line the anglers’ way. When perch
schools are abroad—at dawn or sunset —then the
brown reptiles are to be met with. Maybe it is
because much of the snake-menu is that of the
fish, viz., frogs, insects, shrimps, etc. Once on
the Big Trickle I was following up a mate
who was pulling up the nightlines we had
set earlier in the evening. His duty was to
unhook and tether the fish caught ; mine to re-
bait the lines which he left on the bank. The
frogs (kept in captivity from a hunt of a fortnight
previous) on some of the hooks, especially on lines
off which fish had been recently taken, were
intact. I presently tackled a line near a clump of
reeds. I was surprised to find it stretched out
straight, and it seemed to be moving along the
bank of the billabong. Naturally, I started to
pull it in to get at the hooks. I didn’t notice the
resistance at first, but as the sinker came in sight
—I harried a lantern—l fancied I had made a
great catch in the shape of a big eel, the first I
had seen or heard of north of the Dividing
Range ! But I got a bit pale about the stomach
when, holding up his Nibs before the lantern, I
found I had roped in a six-foot yellow-belly snake,
that hissed like a saw-mill engine. I baited no
more lines that night.
THE ONE OBJECTION.

“Oswald D.” : “ Boronia ” (B. 10/'9/’08)
agrees with “Groper” re the toughness of the
W.A brumby, but wants to know where to find
any nowadays ; and states that along the Black-
wood Biver the brumbies used to run in days long
ago, but do so no more. I have spent the last few
years on the Blackwood and its tributaries, and
know for a fact that up to some few weeks ago the.
brumbies were in hundreds. What they have
done, or where they have disappeared to since
then, I cannot imagine. My opinion is that the
brumbies will continue to breed in that district
for years, for there are miles of country on the
Upper Blackwood which is too hilly and barren
and poison-infested (except for an odd gully here
and there) for anything to live on but brumbies
and kangaroos.
REMARKS BY A DYING HIPPOPOTAMUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the death of the large hippopotamus the Zoo has
lost its senior resident.— Daily Paper.
O Visitor, bespectacled and hot I
X do assure you that this life is not
What I enjoy. Once, in a jungle vast
I roamed at will, and did my hippopot.
No care I knew, but to the river brink
At dusk I’d come to meditate and drink,
And there I’d meet my fragile hippolove,
And she would hippopotamusly wink.
Here in this Zoo excursionists elate
Rush up and point, calling to Bill or Kate
To “’Ave a look at this ’ere What’s-its-name 1”
Or, “ ’lppopot! ” (Thej - steal my aspirate.)
Jesters have ofttimes stood in front of me,
And waved their cats in mock hilarity,
Cheering like this: “ Ilipp ! Hipp ! (Opotamus) !
The humor of such things I cannot see.
My hide is thick, but it affords no shield
To such remarks, and I have often reeled
Beneath the witticisms of the crowd,
And sought the further corner of the field;
O Visitor, bespectacled and hot!
I give my solemn word that I am not
A hit reluctant to resign this life,
And in the Styx to do my hippopot.

FAIRFAX AND ROBERTS
The Oldest Jewellery
House in Sydney,
23 Hunter Street,
“Dob Wilkins”: The other day, at
Wagga (N.S.W.), a local cabby made a wager
against a brother jehu that a certain bird of the
air—to wit, a domestic fowl, chookey-hen or egg-
layer—would not perform a deed which its owner
(charioteer No. 2) said with muchblanky-and-soda
it had accomplished on several occasions. That
was, it had perched at night upon the axle of his
cab, and been driven to the railway-station and
back home without showing the least concern at
the movement of the vehicle. The sceptical one
offered “ a pound to a shilling.” The subject of
the controversy was found reposing as usual on
the axle aforesaid, so the horse was harnessed and
a start was made, the other party to the bet fol-
lowing to see fair play. The journey, over two
miles, was successful; although dogs occasionally
ran behind in a cloud of dust and inspected the
egg-layer, it remained perfectly calm and un-
biassed. The parties received an uproarious
ovation on their return.

“Dandalup”: Be Port Hedland. One
“ Albatross ” (who is a mariner) reaches out (B.
l/10/’08) for the northern extremity of me—the
place where the hair ought to grow—because I put
in a good word for the Nor’-West, and said that
Port Hedland is “one of the finest natural ports
in the North.” For this seabird’s benefit, I repeat
that statement—it is, and I don’t give a hang
whether the other ports blush or not ! He admits
that Port Hedland really has got a depth of eight
fathoms in the west channel. That admission
substantiates my statement that “the port could
boast a depth of from six to eight fathoms,”
which it does also in other parts of the harbor
besides the channel. I’ll admit that the channel
is not the easiest in the world to navigate,
but, at the same time, the mariner (ancient or
otherwise) who is incapable of berthing his craft
at the Hedland jetty deserves to lose his “ elusive
ticket.” When this particular bird starts talking
about “bars,” he forgets that they are small
obstacles when there’s a good, land-locked harbor
behind and a rise and fall of tide amounting to
23ft. As to “Albatross’s” wild surmise that I
am a forwarding agent —I’m not. If I were, it
would give me extreme pleasure to forward
“ Albatross” to a warmer climate.

“Edyson”: Poole took up the 300 acres
just beyond Justin’s selection. He had come
from the North-East, they said, and was the
son of an old settler. Anyhow, he was certainly
bush bred, a lank, angular young man with hip
bones like an old horse, and freckles like ironbark
samples. When he walked he shambled worse
than a tarantula, and his verbosity ran to about
10 words a week, two of which were expended in
wishing good morning to Justin across the rails,
and two more to asking for letters in at Crowbar.
The Justins were satisfied that Len Poole was
mad. His madness was not a dangerous malady;
there was just enough of it to make a peculiarly
eccentric and irresponsible ass of him. Poole’s
madness led him to hang about Justin’s house at
nights in the most ridiculous way. He would
Saunter up to the place after dark, and lean
loosely over the garden fence, or prop
himself between the chimneys, or
squat on the tank stand, and put
in an hour or so twiddling a
stick before straddling back
to his hut again. At first
the Justins would ask
him in, but Len
would grin and
squirm, and reckon
he thought he
ought to be going,
and when the
family went inside
he’d return to his
camp. He had
been discovered
leaning against the
house in the midst
of heavy rain, and
the family got so
used to his quaint
conduct that they
ceased to regard
him at all. When
Poole had been in
the district about
21 months, Annie
Justin was married
to Cooper at the
Mill, and after
that it was noticed
that Poole’s visits
ceased. A fort-
night later, Justin
met him on the
road, and bade him
good-day. Poole
rounded on his
neighbor, and his
face displayed a
co w 1 i k e resent-
ment. “Don’t you
be tellin’ me good-
day,” he said sul-
lenly. “I don’
wanter talk to you,
nor any belongin’ to
you. Nice girl your
daughter is, goin’ ’n’ marryin’ Cooper after the
way she strung me on/” Then ,Tustin understood.
Poole had been courting Annie in his own quaint
way, and no one had dreamt of it, least of all
Annie.

“Arno Bay ” : One of the largest stump-
grubbing contracts on record has just been com-
pleted in S. Aus. A new stock route from Pt.
Augusta to Murat Bay, on the West Coast, has
been cleared a chain wide, mostly through dense
mallee scrub, for a distance of 150 miles, and tanks
have been sunk at 20-mile intervals. Time taken,
with a gang of eight men, 12 months, which is
held to be somewhat slick by Crow-eaters qualified
to judge.
“ Gil” : The saddle-horse and pack-horse
are little more than memories Outback on the
roads to the Big Sheds. They went considerably
out of date with the last of the good seasons, and
the speedy, economical bicycle and the hurrying
spirit of the age drove them further and further
into oblivion. Only their ghosts and dry bones
pervade the Big Silences now. The bike has
become a firmly-established circumstance, and in
fine weather it is a boon to the “big gun ” and
“ringer”—who always aspire to catch a distant
roll-call with about two and a half seconds to
spare. But in wet times it is a cross between a
family bereavement and a curse factory. Free-
wheels afford no advantage, and so the old-
fashioned but stronger and more reliable “set”
wheels predominate. When pedalling across the
level plains the cyclist is always under the im-
pression that he is pushing up-hill, and yet, on
looking back, he is prepared to swear that he
must have been coming down. No matter where
he be the rider can invariably delude himself into
the idea that he is in a geographical depression,
with the country gradually rising on all sides out
to the far horizon. But the best luck a cyclist
can encounter is to get on to a. fresh camel pad,
whereon the clods and ruts are ground into fine
dust and trampled down almost as hard as
asphalt. Consequently the wheelman is the only
man Outback (excepting the squatter) who can
mention a camel without holding his nose and
cursing in at least two dead languages.

“Kodak The experience of the Inverell
man who had one of his fingers bitten off by a
greyhound he was lifting out from the wheels of a
sulky reminds me of a similar experience. We
were enjoying the evening repast when a series of
dog-howls shattered the welkin. We rose in a
body from the hash, and rushed up the hall. The
leading lodger dashed back the glass-panelled hall
door, regardless of expense or the landlady’s feel-
ings, and we deployed into the garden. On the
ornamental iron-gate the fat brown dog from next
door was hanging by his hind legs. He had
evidently pursued the house feline home and, the
gate having banged behind him, had endeavored
to leap out again. A boarder—whose ambition it
was to win theV.C. —dashed forward with the
intention of untangling the brute and stopping
the hideous noise. We saw him get to grips with
it, but the subsequent proceedings were too
hurried to be distinguished. To us it seemed as
if 15 dogs and 10 boarders were having a fight to
the death, to the howling by a choir of 300 demons,
cockatoos and hand-organs. We all performed a
mad sort of war-dance round the whirling mass,
looking for a chance to rescue the boarder from
the dog, or the dog from the boarder, or the gate
from both of them. But no chance appeared.
The riot proceeded and grew in fury until the dog,
in making a particularly vicious snap at the
boarder’s ear, fell off the gate and rushed furiously
in pursuit of a cat that had been watching from
the other side of the road. We carried the bitten
boarder inside, and sent in next door to ask if
they had any whisky. Next door—which had
feasted its eyes on the fight—basely retorted that
it hadn’t a drop in the house, so someone borrowed
2s. 6d. and we adjourned to the pub.
“ Wang ” writes :
Horse intelligence yarns in The Bulletin some time
back remind me of old Prince.
He belonged to Cocky Thompson, for whom I was slav-
ing at the time.
Thompson kept his chaff lying loose in a shed. The
shed door was fastened with the mean type of cocky’s
favorite catch—a piece of leather strap and a peg.
Old Prince, nosing at the catch one day, was delighted
to find how easily it was manipulated, and some time
afterwards emerged with a very satisfied look on his
dial and a ditto feeling in his innards.
Thompson nearly took a fit when he found it out. But
his meanness was of the deep-rooted variety, and instead
of buying a bolt and padlock, he fixed up some contrap-
tion out of the cocky’s stand-by—fencing wire.
The regal equine came along next day as usual, and
after a few minutes’ fruitless nibbling, a look of dawning
comprehension spread o’er his brow. He called up his
r eserves, and deliberately turning his stern, backed up
against the door for all he was worth.
No respectable door could stand much of that kind of
treatment, and with a few groans it broke away from
Cocky’s patent-wire fastening. A full-blown Prince some
time afterwards staggered out of the shed just at the
moment that Cocky let the light of his countenance fall
upon him, also a couple of handy stones.
Then Thompson determined on something desperate.
He’d stop that dashed horse getting to that chaff or
know the reason why.
He lost half-a-day watching Prince from cover. That
old robber seemed to know something was in the wind,
and deliberately fooled about for six hours. Then, the
coast seeming clear, he applied his energies to opening
the door.
Thompson bolted around a circuitous route till he
came to the back of the chaff shed, and let himself in «
back door.
The other door began to hang out signals of distress,
and Thompson grabbed a pitchfork used for throwing
sheaves about, and fitted the prongs into the cracks in
the portal.
The door creaked harder, and Prince, evidently en-
couraged by these signs, put on more steam.
Thompson set his teeth and thrust.
In describing it afterwards, we couldn’t make out any-
thing barring that he thought an earthquake had struck
the place.
The door came back with a crash and caught fair on the
tail end of his countenance, and he thought his ear had
been attacked by elephants.
He arose in time to see old Prince doing an untimed
record away from the door, switching his fly-flicker
excitedly.
It cost Thompson something for a new door. And the
old horse never came back.
CANTANKEROUS FANTODS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Big Bill and Mick good mates had been,
I knew, since eighteen-ninety-three,
And many times the pair I’d seen
Linked in a fond, fraternal spree,
And miners who frequent the inns
At Sanger’s (known as Kelly’s Sins)
Had christened them “ the Siamese Twins.”
So when Big Bill fell out with Mick,
And pitched his luggage down the hill,
And Michael gave Big Bill the kick,
And went to board with Pickersgill,
We looked into each other’s eyes,
And scraped our chins in manner wise,
Like chickens clucking our surprise.
I spoke to Bill. He said ’twas true
He’d loved Mick Hogan like a brother,
“ But it’s like this, ’tween me and you,
We ain’t cut out for one another.
His jim-jams never would agree
With mine. ’Twas horrible to see
The beggars fight so eerily! ”

A.L. : A host of good touches in your satire ;
but most of it suffers from a fatal defect, viz., obscurity
of purpose. A satire should flagellate its object first,

being sardonic in verse it is advisable to pay great
attention to your metre....The Wasp: The afflicted
Caroline makes a very dreary poem. A fragment:—
Down her back in glittering tresses
Hang her beautiful golden hair.

Cloud the brow of the maid devine.

A Sarge deputation from the Women's
Liberal League waited on the Premier
recently to ask that the Local Govern-
ment Act might be amended . . . giving
women the right to sit as members of
shire and borough councils if elected.
The Premier replied that the course
the women must take if they
wished the change was to en- . <t.
deavor to convert Parliament,
but there was no evidence A
that women really j&mß ||"®L
on
The same deputation had another request. It was that women might
be afforded equal facilities with men for the acquisition of agricultural
and horticultural knowledge at Government institutions. Mr. Wade said
that; speaking broadly, he would never approve of anything which
tended to cause women to undertake work that would lower them In the
eyes of men. With reference to the agricultural college question, Hr.
Wade said he would not support anything that would assist in making
it even possible for women to do hard manual work.

Do you
realize
the immense importance of the unique
superiority of Odol? While all other
preparations for cleansing the mouth
and teeth are effective only during the
few moments of application, the anti-
septic and refreshing power of Odol
continues gently but persistently .for
hours afterwards. Odol penetrates into
the interstices of the teeth and the
mucous membrane of the mouth, to a
certain extent impregnating them, and
thus securing a safeguard and preserva-
tive for the teeth such as no other denti-
frice can provide, not even approximately.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
O. H. Brook, one time Ma State’s champion
cyclist, is now “ Constable Brook,” of the Sydney
police.
Poet Adam Lindsay Gordon’s armchair—
the furniture he dreamed his verses in—is one of the
few show-pieces of far-out Longreach (Q.). Mrs.
Sutton, the owner, formerly lived at Mt. Gambier,
and secured the treasure shortly after Gordon’s
death.
There are whispers in the chambers that
Chief Justice Griffith, of the High Court, is likely
to apply for extended leave of absence. His late
work on Dante has whetted a desire for travel.
He wishes to do more for Dante than he has done,
and thinks a personal tour of the poet’s country
would help him to present the character in more
complete form.
W. P. Crick died much as he lived. He
had made two wills, and had destroyed both.
Then he set about another, and when he was re-
minded of it he thought a moment, then —“Oh,
let it go !” So he died intestate, leaving £9900, in
Government stock, a small sheep holding at Gun-
dagai, and the Randwick house he lived in.
S. Australia’s Labor Premier Price does
not get better. He looks white, haggard and
tired, and his colleagues will be glad when the
present session is over and he can get a rest. The
voyage to England early this year was meant as a
holiday, but he really worked harder than he
would have done had he stopped at home.
John Marshall, who had groped together
the champion collection of facts (and thereabouts)
concerning the early years of the Westralian gold-
fields, died the other day, in the middle of another
book on his pet subject. He had used up many
incidents in his “ Battling for Gold,” published
some years ago, and Rougemont’s Wide World
Magazine and others had greedily gulped down
many of his goldfields hair-raisers.
Dean O’Hea (R.C.), who ruled at Pentridge
(Vic.) for many years, was an obstinate man, and a
dictator to be obeyed. Yet he found his match once
in a brick carter. Their vehicles met in one of
tl e narrow lanes about Brunswick, and, as usual,
“ the Dane ” wanted the right of the road. The
bricky must go back, nothing less would suit
“the Dane.” The priestly one took out his
breviary and commenced reading his “office.”
The brickmaking one produced his nose-bag, gave
his horse a fee l and sat down to his own midday
meal. After half-an-hour “the Dane” gave in;
he said it was the only time he had ever given in,
and he wouldn’t have done it only he had been
“Listing.” The Dean died in the purple (having
been made a Monsignor), with a big bank balance
to his credit.
CHARLIE McDONALD, M.H.R., OF
QUEENSLAND.
Aboriginal One-Eyed Tommy, who was
drowned lately in Moreton Bay, spoke English
correctly and with a perfect accent. Some years
ago he walked up to Major Lyons, of Brisbane,
and, giving a military salute, asked for sixpence.
The Major refused. Tommy then said, “I’m a
good bushman, Major, and if you give mesixpence
I’ll promise to help you to escape from Brisbane
when the Japs attack it. I’ll take you right
through the bush to Toowoomba without touching
a road.” Tommy got the sixpence.
The Westralian Commission
that is trying to find out if there is
a meat ring over on that side had a
look the other day at Isidor
Emanuel, head of the firm of
Emanuel Bros., and generally sup-
posed to be the centre-stone of the
ring, if there is one. A man of
many connections is Isidor. Over
30 years ago he got into the nor’-
west cattle business, and nowadays
he is interested in Emanuel Brothers
(the other brother is Sydney); and
in Forrest, Emanuel and Co. (the
Forrests are out of that now —
the firm consists of the Emanuels
and F. H. Brackenbury). With
the Pearses and McLarty they
form the Obagama Cattle Co.,
which owns Obagama, Jubilee and
Kolyeeda stations, about 1,400,000
acres in the lot; with the Pearses
alone they own Kamwell and
Meda; with W. J. Carson they
own Margaret Downs (1,950,000
acres) and a few other trifles; with
Syd Kidman and one or two more
they own Carlton (600,000 acres);
and Forrest, Emanuel & Co.’s own
exclusive little lot consists of Sturt
Meadows, Erlistoun and Gnarloo
runs, in Westralia, besides • great
slices of the Northern Territory.
And when the Westralian sees a
retail butcher’s shingle with the
name of Holmes Bros, on it—and
he can see it in most places—he
can reckon that Isidor Emanuel is
behind that, too.
Ambrose Pratfc has written
David Syme’s “ Life.” Alfred
Deakin has furnished a lengthy in-
troduction, and Ward, Lock & Co.
are to publish the volume simul-
taneously in Melbourne and Lon-
don this month. Two men more
unlike than David Syme and
Ambrose Pratt could hardly be
conceived; yet David in his old
age took very kindly to the weaver
of startling romances, and ex-
pressed a wish that Pratt should
be his biographer.
Ex-Judge Wilkinson, who died recently,
was the last of the District Court pensioners m
N. S. Wales. He had been on the list for 15
years. The State now pays pensions to four
Supreme Court judges—Foster, Walker, Stephen
and Owen. Messrs. Foster and Walker served
years short of the necessary period to entitle
them to pensions, but as they retired on the
score of ill-health, their short service made no
difference.
“ Bee ” writes :
Little Sumner Locke is a fine exposition of
Australian versatility. Though still in her ’twenties,
the small authoress has been as many things
as an ordinary actor on a long tour. She
started as a tea-room grace ; then helped her
political sister Lilian with a registry office ; afterwards
became a typist for Robert Harper ; then took up the
duties and responsibilities of sub-editress and chief clerk on
the Native Companion, writing dainty verse and feminine
little stories what time she wasn’t writing “ Answers to
Corres.” And, at latest, the indomitable little woman
has written a no-el, which is expected to boom, and the
very creditable Cumedy of a recent afternoon.
“ Quan ” : Be Henry Cobden (B. 10/’9/’08).
On first coming to N. S. Wales he got a job as
clerk and storekeeper at Lawson’s place at
Dave} o Plains, and after five or six years there
opened a store at Molong, which he kept till his
death in 1858. Before coming to Australia he was
connected with the manufacturing business of his
brother Richard, the Freetrade and Corn Law
crank, as commercial agent. In that capacity he
travelled a good deal in Europe and the United
States.
William Bowen, chemist, of Collins-street,
and an old Melbourne identity, died last week.
He arrived in Port Phillip on Dec. 29, 1852 ; off
Point Lonsdale, the vessel ran on a sandbank, and
all the passengers had to help pull her off. Mr.
Bowen started in business as a chemist in partner-
ship with George Lewis, and has been putting
sealing-w r ax *">n his neat little parcels ever since.
Malcolm M’Eacharn, one of Melbourne’s
past gaud mayors, has purchased Galloway
House, with park and grounds, etc., from the
Earl of Galloway, with entry at Whitsuntide,
1909. The estate consists of 10,400 acres of the
best arable land, and 18’Malcolm, it is said, will
make his future home there, so adding another to
the long list of absentees. Mrs. Malcolm is a
daughter of the wealthy Bendigonian, John Boyd
Watson. Billy Murdoch, the cricketer, married
another daughter.
Dr. Paton, Sydney’s Government medical
officer, is appointed Inspector-General of Chari-
ties, vice Brodie. The doctor is a well-known
and liked Government official. The Public
Service Board appointed him to this very position
in 1900, and he was all packed-up, ready to go.
But Critchett Walker was alive in those days, and
his battles with the P.S.B. were common know-
ledge. So C.W. said a medical man wasn’t
needed at the Asylums; and as Critchett Walker
was nearest the Ministerial ear, he won. Now
Paton, who was evidently eager for the billet, gets
it after all.
“ O.” : I am angry, wild, mad. I have
just read an article in the Strand Magazine that
makes my blood boil. It is about Smiths—
eminent Smiths, ancient ana modern; John,
Adam, William, and Heaven-knows-what Smiths.
Some are lords, some historians, dine bishops,
some worse even than that. There are also thirty-
six photographs of thirty-six Smiths, and remarks
about dozens of other Smiths. And yet—yes, it’s
true. Not a word about him! Plenty about
other Australian Smiths, including brewer Smith,
of Adelaide, and Villeneuve, of Tasmania ; but of
him, Bruce, nothing. And this in the Strand,
one of the magazines of the Empiah ! What
encouragement has a man got to fly flags and bore
youngsters on Empiah Day after this ?
A queer character of Melbourne’s whole-
sale fruit and vegetable markets is Joshua Moss,
of Fitzroy, widower and produce-dealer. He has
a storeroom down in King-street, but it hardly
counts. He strolls down to the Victoria market
of a morning and buys by the load, all for imme-
diate shipment to Sydney, Brisbane, Bendigo,
Ballarat, or some other place. The grower whose
load he buys takes it to the wharf or rail and dis-
charges it there, and Moss’s minions do the rest.
He pervades markets and wharves with his
pockets full of loose gold, and pays as he goes,
and has no dread of garroters or robbers. He
keeps no books, but his memory for the cauli-
flower and the spring onion is good enough to
prevent him being “ got at ” for a penny, and the
scale of his operations may be judged from the
fact that he sent to Sydney, per boat and rail,
2000 dozen cauliflowers in one recent week.
MISS SALVIN , the lady who brought a suit
against Miss Carrie Moore's new husband for
alleged breach of promise. (The suit teas
settled out of court.)
Photo. —Perry & Dougall, Sarony Studios, Melbourne.
“ Sr.” : The old lady who ran an itinerant
match-selling establishment at the corner of
Spring and Collins streets, Melbourne, has ap-
parently gone the way of all old rnatch-sellers.
She knew every Minister in all the five Federal
Cabinets, passed the time o’ day to Alfred Deakin,
“worded” under-secretaries and stout State
officials, and sold sundry boxes of lucifers to
private members and aides-de-camp. She was a
nice, respectable, tidy old lady, but she has been
posted as missing at the Commonwealth offices
for the last few months, and fears are entertained
that she has foundered.
J. M. Stuart, K.C., who died in Adelaide
on Oct. 5, at the age of 75, was for years Crown
Solicitor and Bublic Prosecutor there. He was
long ago nicknamed “Old Necessity,” as the
result of the quip of a brother advocate, who so
christened him on the strength of the old
proverb—“ Necessity knows no law.” But it was
unfair ; for Stuart knew a good deal of law, and
he managed the Govt, legal work in excellent
fashion. He was once a legal partner of ex-Judge
Boucaut, and was noted for his long white
beard, his suavity, and his good fellowship.
Latest announced visitor to Australia is
Lord Rosebery. He has some property interests
in Australia —owns the Athenaeum Club building,
Sydney, and burnt his fingers over the land boom
co. which built the Middle Harbor (Sydney) sus-
pension bridge. Also, Lord Rosebery is credited
with remarking that the social leaders of Aus-
tralia were content to sit on 10-guinea chairs and
look at 10-shilling oleographs. Altogether, he
will be an interesting visitor.
The case of the seven Sydney Eight-Hour-
day veterans who make up 500 years among them
suggests how few persons in a line may connect
the present with the time when King Edward’s
family began to reign in England. Dr. C. R.
Gregory, an English writer, dug up the case of
Sir Stephen Fox. Fox married in 1654, and his
first child died in 1655, three years before the
death of Oliver Cromwell. He married again late
in life, and had a daughter in 1727. This
daughter lived 98 years and died in 1825, when
Queen Victoria was six years old. Thus 170
years elapsed between the deaths of these two
sisters.
Thomas Bingham Muntz, a well-known
civil engineer, died at Malvern (Melb.) on the 6th
inst. Deceased was born in Ireland, but came to
Australia as a youngster in 1854. When local
government was initiated, he opened out as a
civil engineer, and did good work, consulting and
otherwise, for many a shire and council. His
biggest works in that way were at Prahran. In a
domestic way he had the distinction of being the
father of two brainy daughters. One is Miss
Edith Muntz, Master of Science ; the other, the
well-known Mrs. Muntz-Adams, who is a very
clever portrait painter sometimes.
The aged William Valentine Robinson,
late Clerk of the Vic. Illegislative Assembly,
weighed anchor and left no address on the sth
inst. He was a native of Leeds (Ma country),
and was drawn to Australia in 1861 by a special
engagement as a Parliamentary reporter to a
Melbourne paper. Once in the House, he never
left it. Five years of newspaper work were
followed by some years as a Hansard reporter,
and by further terms as clerk assistant and finally
as clerk. The duties of his last job he carried out
stupendously for 11 years, retiring on a pension in
1902. When he deceased, he was 72 and a C.M.G.
Word comes from Italy about Francesco
Sceusa, the fiery Socialist who for years had a
billet in the N.S.W. Lands Department, and over
whose opinions more than one Minister was sadly
troubled. Sceusa, falling ill, returned early last
year to Italy; and there, having recovered, he is
fighting as strenuously as ever, mainly against
Nasi, ex-Minister of Education and member for
Trapani (Sceusa’s birthplace). Nasi is only
recently out of prison, having been sentenced to
11 months and the loss of political rights for four
and a half years for corruption. As he spent most
of the stolen Government money in Trapani,
Trapani thinks he’s all right. In June Sceusa
stood as a candidate against him ; for Nasi is
always elected, although ineligible. But, in con-
sequence of the wholesale arrest of country trades-
unionist leaders (his chief supporters), charged
with plotting, etc., Sceusa failed. On August 2,
however, at the municipal elections, Sceusa, with
three others of his party, polled heavily.
“ Bloggs ” goes to Monaco :
Sydney Daily Telegraph was right “ out ” in its leader
last week on the gambling competition between Sir Hiram
Maxim and Lord Rosslyn. The latter was congratulated
for his wisdom in playing with counters. “Otherwise,”
said the paper, “he would have added the experience of
going broke to the variegated experiences that he has
had already.” As a fact, even to go broke at
roulette would have been no new experience. He
journeyed to Monte Carlo two years ago on be-
half of a syndicate, of which he was a member,
played there a system of his own invention, and went
gloriously broke in a fortnight. Maxim is a crank on the
futility of “ systems,” but he is no anti-gambling tutor.
He is a regular visitor to Monaco and a frequenter of the
rooms. Years ago, when I paid my first visit to the
Casino, I was shown a short, white-haired man punting
beside a stout, red-haired Jew. The Jew threw two or
three louis on a number, which promptly turned up,
bringing him in a pile of gold ; the white-haired man lost.
The latter was Maxim ; the other was one of the Roths-
childs. Maxim is supposed to have originated the
epigram about “ red winning sometimes and black win-
ning sometimes, but white (i.e., Blanc, the proprietor of
the Casino) winning always.” In theory, like scores of
others, he is doubtless opposed to gambling ; but in
practice he goes in for it with considerable enthusiasm.
“ Laner ” : A kindly Bulletin par on the
late George Bruce, of Melbourne, might give the
impression that he was an enthusiastic Protec-
tionist, inasmuch as he happened to be chairman
of the Denton Hat Mills. George Bruce, to tell
the truth, was merely a commercial result of his
elder brother, the late J. M. Bruce. J.M. had
the brains (until a calamity befel him), and podgy
little George did as brother told him. As for the
Denton Hat Mills, it was started by J.M., in
league with other softgoods bosses, for the benefit
of their wholesale trade. The sale of Denton hats
to shopkeepers was conditional on the mainte-
nance of a fixed standard of prices to the public ;
and the public stands to be victimised all the
time by that sort of combine trading. The busi-
ness of legislation is, of course, to provide against
the danger of good things being put to bad uses.
Australia wants all the local industry it can get,
and the hat industry at present is insufficiently
protected, judging from the increased display of
imported felts in shop-windows. But it wasn’t as
a patriotic friend of Australian manufactures that
George Bruce became connected with the Denton
Mills.
“ One-Three-Six ” writes from the Bar :
In tipping the prosy Equity leader, Alexander Gordon,
and the dapper Adrian Knox for theN.S. W. Chief Justice-
ship, you make dark horses of Cullen —probably the
most learned lawyer in the Commonwealth after Griffith —
and the virile eommonsense Alex. Shand. Of course
Wade as Chief Justice would be a clumsy legal joke, and
he’s not quite so humorless as that. A puisne Judge can
“concur,” without much damage to sound law; but a
Chief Justice has to deliver the law. Wade might be able
to concur, but not to deliver judgments. Alex. Shand,
like Pilcher (whose appointment no one would question),
has as much knowledge of common sense as common law,
and with his vigor and grasp, would be a far more
suitable man for the Chief’s post than any
anaemic Equity man, always excepting Cullen. He is of
the Cussen type—we want more of them. Wise
was in the running once ; but the present Chief’s tenacity
staved off his rush. I plump for Shand as Chief —young,
vigorous, learned, full of eommonsense, and dignified.
And, by the way, “ 10-2-4 ” is out of it when he says that
G. H. Reid is a “ painful spectacle in argument before a
discerning Judge or Bench of Judges.” It is fashionable
to discount Reid’s ability in appeals. Of course, no
solicitor would brief him to argue on a point of pure
abstract law or Equity. But in certain cases he is the
strongest man in the profession. For example, his argu-
ment before the N.S. W. Supreme Court when the late
W. P. Crick was cited to show cause was masterly. There
everything was against Reid, and the Court came pre-
pared to strike Crick off without phrases. Reid’s effort
was admitted by members of the profession who were
present to have been a remarkably fine one. He not only
handled his case well, but his appeals to the higher
regions of abstract law, justice and civil right, his manner
with the Judges—a beautiful mixture of suavity and
sarcasm—all constituted a masterly bit of work, which
had its effect for the time being. Let there be no mis-
take, Reid is a strong man—within his limitations, per-
haps the strongest man at the N.S.W. Bar.

WHEN THE BLOOD’S BAD THE
DIGESTION IS BAD.
Facts that Dyspeptics Should Keep in Mind.
A Rational Way of Curing Indigestion by
Strengthening the Stomach—An Instance
in Sydney, N.S.W.
A weak stomach, and thin watery blood go
hand-in-hand. That’s why anaemic people usually
have indigestion. When there’s indigestion, the
food doesn’t nourish and the blood hasn’t a chance
to re-establish itself. Good blood is absolutely
necessary to healthy digestion.
That is why a debilitated, run-down condition
so often brings on a disturbance of the digestive
system that frequently runs into a very severe
stomach disorder.
The principle of the tonic treatment for indi-
gestion is that it makes the blood rich and red,
promotes a normal flow of gastric fluids, tones up
and strengthens the stomach, and recovery is rapid
and permanent.
This principle was illustrated in the case of Mrs.
S. H. Longhurst, 18 Kettle Street, Redfern.
She says:—
“I used to have very indifferent health. My
appetite was always poor. Some days I wouldn’t
touch a thing except my morning cup of tea.
Often after eating I’d bring up what I had swal-
lowed and sometimes quantities of green bile. I’d
often wake up in the morning with a violent sick
headache, and I’d have it all day. The pain was
on the top of the head, just as if it was opening
and closing. I’d be very restless at night and
might not close my eyes for hours. Every morn-
ing I’d wake up with a thickly-furred tongue and
a nasty sour taste, and my food was always repeat-
ing on me. When I took a meal the food would
lie at the breast bone for hours like a hard lump
that wouldn’t go up or down. . Some days I’d be
quite swelled out with wind. It would settle
round my heart and make it beat most irregularly.
When I took up a book the lines would run to-
gether as if I were in a mist. All day I was
drowsy. I was very sallow and I lost flesh con-
siderably. I’d have aches between my shoulde
blades, especially after a meal. Some days I’d feel
better and then I’d get a relapse. I was never
really well or hearty, but all my symptons began
to fade away as I progressed with Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. My food began to digest more easily
and I could eat without fear of after effects. I
lost the pain in the chest and shoulder-blades, and
my headaches eased off every day. I got brighter
and more energetic and began to see well. The
attacks of wind eased off. I soon lost that sickly
yellow look and put on flesh. Every dose made me
eat better. I kept on till I was thoroughly cured.
I enjoy the best of health and am a firm believer in
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.”
By their direct action on the blood and nerves
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured anaemia, sci-
atica, indigestion, paralysis, biliousness, nervous-
ness, headaches, backaches, neuralgia, debility,
rheumatism and all ailments of women.

The Lone Lad: “ I’m heginnin’ to think I ortcr
get a gun. Where would I he if these fellers
started ? ”
s
' It seems now pretty certain that the new
Defence system will provide some pay—say £1
for the fortnight’s camp—for the compulsorily-
trained citizen youth. The extra cost would not
be formidable, and could be met by special taxa-
tion of those who, for any reason, dodge service.
A member of the .N.S. W. Government ex-
plained, quite contentedly, in the Assembly the
other day, when discussing the Peel River re-
sumptions, that ‘‘the value of land for taxation is,
for some reason or other, invariably below the
true value of the land.” The “some reason or
other” is a contemptible evasion. There is no
uncertainty about the reason. It is that dishonest
landowners under-estimate the value of their hold-
ings so as to swindle the country, and dishonest
Governments condone the swindle.
The N.S.W. railways’ annual re-
port shows once more the size of the
subsidy which the “backbone of the
country ” gets from the State that i«
alleged to live on the backbone’s toil
arid sturdy independence. Last year
the average amount paid per ton for the
cartage of grain and flour from up
country was 3s. per 100 miles, and for
hay, straw and chaff 3s. 2d. per 100
miles; but the manufacturer, who has
to send his stuff in Class 11. or Class
111., had to pay from £1 12s. 7d. to
£2 os. 4d. It isn’t the “backbone of
the country’s ” fault that he gets his
goods carried for 3s. when the manu-
facturer has to pay from £1 12s. 7d.
to £2 os. 4d. for his goods ; but it does
suggest that wheat-growing and wool-
raising are not the great natural indus-
tries they are cracked up to be by the
importing crowd. Anyway, if an alleged
champion wanted a start of 70yds. in a
100yds, race, his claim to be called the
champion would come in for consider-
able scoffing.
It is an amazing thing, yet true
according to the records, that last year
in all the Northern Territory (523,620
square miles) not one person died be-
tween the ages of five years and 20.
That, of course, excludes aborigines, who
don’t register. Unfortunately it doesn’t
mean only that the Northern Territory
is a wonderfully healthy place. It means
also that the Territory is so shockingly
empty and neglected that of Euro-
peans there were altogether only 1302
on Dec. 31, and most of them adults,
and of Asiatics 2295 (and as many
more as could dodge the police count).
Of females the whole 523,620 acres owns
only 439 whites, and of Asiatics 148 —
one to every 15 Asiatic males : a shud-
dersome proportion which means fearful
things for the Black Sister who sits at
our front door.
Now that it has got a fairly respectable
all-Australian tariff for the first time, this country
is beginning to find out a few of the things it
really can make. Somebody, for instance, has
just remembered that way back Binghi, in Queens-
land, used to occasionally turn up in more or less
civilised parts wearing in his whiskers a meer-
schaum pipe of his own manufacture; and a
would-be Sydney manufacturer has begged the
Charters Towers Mining and Pastoral Associa-
tion to try to find out where that meerschaum
came from.
In view of the movement in favor of a
Federal progressive land tax, it is interesting to
recall the fact that in 1840, when S. Aus. —then a
Crown colony—got into financial difficulties and
tried to borrow £120,000 from the British Govern-
ment, the commission which considered the state
of the colony’s affairs made this suggestion among
others:—
Another measure which we should be very desirous to
see adopted in the colony is the imposition of a land-tax,
the produce of which would assist in rendering the income
completely equal to the expenditure, and dispense with the
costly and improvident plan of continued resort to loans.
It is a species of tax, we maj' observe, which has always
the further advantage of tending to prevent the accumu-
lation in private hands of large and unprofitable tracts of
waste lands.
Gladstone was one of the members of this com-
mission. Unfortunately, the good advice was not
adopted, or the public debt of S. Aus. would not
now be so colossal.
With the aid of wireless telegraphy, the
numerous islands with which Provi-
dence has sprinkled the Pacific may
become an additional strength to this
continent. In the event of war, a
fleet of fast vessels, fitted for wireless
work and acting in conjunction with
the telegraphic land stations, could
maintain a fairly effective screen,
through which it would be difficult
for a hostile fleet of any size to pass
unnoticed. Of course, in the present
condition of Australian defence, the
intelligence that the enemy was steam-
ing like Qheol for Sydney Heads would
be next to useless, for the hired iron-
mongery that litters the harbor what
time it isn’t pottering round the South
Seas and being laughed at by canni-
bals, could be finished by a very
moderate fighting ship in one bite.
Still, it might give us time to nail up a
few decorations and arrange a State
banquet for the conquerors.
The Kidston Government ought to get to
holts with the present distribution of the As-
sembly seats in Bananaland. The position is now
a scandal. Bulloo, which is foolish enough to re-
turn “ Janny ” Leahy, can only muster 975 elec-
tors, while Charters Towers has to be content
with two members for 10,977. Talk about one
man one vote !
The evil that befalls a tariff-smitten
country is still increasing Australia’s burden of
ruin. A company with a capital of £40,000
is being formed to turn wool into flannel and
blankets at Warrnambool (Vic.). It proposes to
put £19,000 into machinery, which will
furnish an annual output of 600,000yds.
of flannel and 12,500 pairs of blankets.
Even that part of Warrnambool which
won’t get a job in the factory will be
able to sell some of its spuds on the spot
instead of having to pay heavy freight to
feed them into foreign mouths.
Ex-Senator Downer, K.C., has been weep-
ing in public again. It was when he moved in
the S. Aus. Legislative Council against the awful
proposal of the Price Government that Australians
should be appointed to the superfluous job of
State Governor. The horror of it stirred up all
his emotions, and he blubbered out his peroration
in a succession of patriotic sobs. It was called to
mind that when he went to England in 1887 to
attend the late Queen’s jubilee, he wept copiously
while delivering a loyal oration at the big official
banquet.
PREMIER BENT, OF VICTORIA, IN HIS
NEW CLOTHES.
Photo. —The Ana Studio, Auburn, Victoria.
Murray, of Warrnambool, recently made
repeated requests in the Victorian Assembly that
the Income Tax Bill should be postponed till
after the Budget. It was a fair demand, but it
didn’t suit Adolphus at all ; for he couldn’t
simultaneously pose as a poor Treasurer who
badly needed the income-tax to help him along,
and a Heaven-born financier who had created a
huge surplus out of nothing. So it was necessary
to silence Murray. Did Bent bellow or roar or
swear, or promise impossible things ? Not quite !
He just blurted out—“ Now, wasn’t I good.to the
Warrnambool Hospital?” It was Bent’s idea of
political argument put into a sentence.
It is most unfortunate for Captain Jacky
Evans. Premier of Tasmania, that he is in the
shipping business. A while ago an inter-State
conference of Ministers of Agriculture was held in
Sydney, when it was agreed that inter-State ship-
ments of fruit, etc., should be inspected at the
port of dispatch; but the importing State was also
given the right of inspection—not necessarily for
publication but as a guarantee of good faith.
Presently trouble arose in Melbourne over some
Tasmanian shipments, and Victoria told Tassy to
send across and see for itself what sort of inspec-
tion was wanted. Though it wasn’t in his depart-
ment, Capt. Jacky went himself, and fixed up an
agreement for the inspection of Tasmanian fruit in
Melbourne instead of in Hobart. Of course, in the
event of the fruit being condemned (as thousands
of cases are) the shipper has to pay freight, but ap-
parently, though he is in the shipping business
himself, a little thing like that never occurred to
Capt. Evans. Yet some people, who don’t
know how impossible it is for a man to remember
every little thing, are making really nasty remarks
about it.
KILLING THE . WATCH DOG.
Mr. Reid spoke against the compulsory training clauses,
and said every young man was to be registered like a
dog.— TELEGRAPH.
R EID: "Fido, you’ll have to die. It would be
cruel to have you registered. Death before
dishonor!”
“H. Phelthatt”: Ever notice how the
English novelists instinctively tell you that Free-
trade England is no place to make money in ?
They all have three axioms: (1) Every novel
must have a hero ; (2) every hero must make a
fortune ; (3) every fortune must be made out of
England.
Mr. William Francis, Launceston, Tas.,
writes: “During the recent hot spell in Mel-
bourne, I had a very severe attack of gastritis. I
tried many remedies, but nothing did me any
good. A friend from Queensland, seeing how ill
I was, recommended me to take Chamberlain s
Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. I did so,
and had only taken about four doses when I obtain-
ed relief. lam a commercial traveller, and visit
many of the mining centres of Tasmania and New
Zealand, and will certainly never go on ray travels
again without a bottle of Chamberlain s Colic,
G. Reid characteristically wishes to throw
the burden of Australia’s Defence, not on the
youth who is just out of the kid stage, but on the
very young kid. A compulsory cadet system is
his idea. Since many think that there is “some-'
thing in ” the cadet idea, it might be pointed out
that young boys cannot be trained so as to be good
adult soldiers ; and if they could, the interference
with their general education necessitated would
be so serious as to make the youngster a poorly
equipped citizen, even though a well-trained
soldier.
The recent progress of Freetrade England,
from figures published in the Pall Mall Gazette
(London): —
(1) The net emigration of people of British birth
meant a loss to Britain of 168,000 people in 1900. In 1907
the loss was up to 375,000. (N.B. —Germany used to lose
in this fashion also in its Freetrade days. It has lately
been gaining 22,000 people, of its own nationality, a year,
because Germans are returning to the Fatherland faster
than they leave it.)
(2) The number of paupers relieved in the British Isles
during July 1, 1900, was 761,000 ; on July 1, 1907, it was
868,000.
(3) In 1900, out of every 1000 British tvades unionists
29 were unemployed. In 1908 the unemployed got up to
90 per 1000. These are unionists only—men with recog-
nised trades and mostly the best men in these trades,
therefore the class which suffers least from scarcity of
work.
No wonder the tariff reform movement is spread-
ing fast and the old Cobden joss begins to totter
on its feet of clay.
Sydney Telegraph (which gets the sort
Of letters it wants) has had a note from one
Courtenay Smith, the most terribly frightened
man in Australia. Says Prophet Smith :
It. is said on good authority that if Germany can obtain
control of the North Sea for only two or three days,
London would be at her mercy, and the British navy a
magnificent spectacle of useless ships. Australia would
be the price of peace.
Mr. Smith wants to know of what use, in such an
event, an Australian navy would be. Where
fore :
The only real protection for this great Commonwealth
is to give Thomas Bent’s ten millions to the Admiralty,
and send another two millions as an annual subsidy.
Smith’s notion apparently is that Australia ought
to add a trifle to the “magnificent spectacle of
useless ships” in the North Sea. But to a man
who isn’t Smith it would seem a reasonable thing
that, if British ships are a mere spectacle, the
people who pay for the spectacle might at least
enjoy the spectacle. Also, if Australia is what
Germany really wants —it is to be “the
price of peace ” then it also seems a
fair thing to give Australia some protection.
It’s all very well for the police to watch the pro-
fessional burglars day and night, but, just in case
of accident —just in case one of the burglars gives
his watchers the slip—the Bank of N. S. Wales
never leaves more than half-a-million lying around
loose on the counters over-night. And Russell
French nearly always shuts the front door before
he quits for the Union Club.
A SITE FOR SORE SYDNEYITES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Throw up your hats and cheer for Canberra, the pro-
posed site for the Federal capital !— E. W. O’Sullivan,
in Sydney Daily Telegraph ( VJIO/’OS ).
The Yass-Canberra site consists of undulating downs, in
places fairly heavily-timbered, but for the most part devoid
of trees.... The equable climate favors also the growth
of all garden plants, even under the present disadvantage
of a want of irrigation.. .. Many permanent creeks inter-
sect the territory... . Not far from the weir site some fine
caves exist, which add greatly to the other attractions of
the district. ... A great point in favor of the Yass-Can-
berra area is its accessibility. It is easily reached from
Sydney. —Sydney Telegraph rapturously (same morning).
Give gladness vent;
Be joyful; cheer and yell, plug hat in hand ;
For Ma has got her sop. Strike up the band !
Spread the astounding tidings through the land—
A Fed’ral capital at her command
Is imminent.
How fair it is !
This site whose miles and miles of arid leas,
Dull brown or grey, extend the eye to please ;
While (crowning glory !) on all sides one sees
A splendid absence of encumbering trees —
A grand point this !
No summer rain
To speak of damps these parts, which is a boon :
Damp and pneumonia march in pairs. Full soon
With rain M.P.’s would wilt and die. The loon
Who sought wet here might seek for many a moon,
Yet seek in vain.
Dryness is so
Delightfully persistent in this spot
That he who dares to make a garden plot
Of cabbages, spuds, carrots or what not,
And does not own a dam, loses the lot,
And soon must go.
True, there are creeks:
But, small or dry, and far between and few ;
No mountain torrents here to spoil the view.
Did ever Nature with such charms endue
A promised land ! Full-handed, here she threw
All that one seeks.
Why, even caves!
And when he’s finished talking of the plains,
And of their treelessness, and of the rains
That come not, for the local still remains
One glory : swift escape by frequent trains—
And so he raves.
Which ravings fall
Right gratefully upon the State Fright ear ;
The harbor dweller’s simply charmed to hear
Praise of this site. The fact that Sydney’s near
Condones its faults —in fact, makes faults appear
Prime virtues all.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 13, 1908.
My Dear Arini,—
Bitter is the disappointment amongst people
who gossip over the untimely finish of the Big-
wood-Salvin entertainment. During its all-too-
buef run it afforded material for the most amazing
crop of yarns. Travelled folk appeared on all
sides and asserted that they had known Bigwood
in England, in Central Africa, in Hindustan, and
in Greenland, and that in these far spots he was
not Percy Plantagenet 8., but, variously, Sam
Biggs, Bill Woods, and occasionally Joe Bloggs.
1 ercy Plantagenet they alleged to be a nom de
theatre a name, to wit, adopted for the allure-
ment of the notoriously guileless theatre-maiden.
Other raconteurs claimed to possess the full
strength of Carrie’s attitude in the matter.
bhe , was represented to be madly in love
with her Percy. Thrilling tales were told of
how she acted to him nightly, and of how
Replied from a box with gestures of adoration.
Winch allegations were countered by others to the
effect that the star soubrette was considerably
riled with her enslaved, partly owing to the sul-
triness of his past, partly to his crass maladroit-
ness in allowing so much of its torrid warmth to
become diffused about the atmosphere. Also it
was asserted that Carrie had served a local news-
paper with a libel writ for £5OOO ; that she was
going to leave the stage and settle down with her
entire family at Plantagenet Manor, the English
abode of the Bigwoods; that the Bigwoods do
not own a manor and never did, but are poor, yet
meticulously honest umbrella-repairers in Holborn
Viaduct, London, E.C. ; that Carrie’s original
swain was on his way out with a loaded Gatling,
tor use upon Plantagenet, amongst his luggage;
that he approved of the match, had no grievance
against Percy, but regards him as a pal, and
k° ;Tu th - L iey are all demonstrable lies, doubtless,
but their recital gave many a worthy citizen inno-
cent pleasure ; so it is to be deeply regretted that
a couple of attorneys have seen fit to slit Dame
Rumor s weazand, as it were, by a sordid mone-
tary settlement just as the lady was warming up
and putting in some good work.
Wasn’t it Marcus Aurelius who said “For
gettm a.ll the joy that’s coinin’ to vou there’s
nothin like bein’ a mixer. The man who travels
one class all the time misses a lot.” If it wasn’t
the Roman potentate it was Tommy Burns who
said it, and Bridegroom Bigwood who acts it.
Even nis front names denote a parental desire to
mix things.
Just when the parties were busy oiling them-
selves for the fray, Mr. Bigwood decided that he
wanted to go back to England quickly, so lawyers
Carroll and Deery got together, arid Friday’s
evening paper bills screeched that the trouble
had been settled. Miss Salvin (lier name turns
out to be Salvin, not Silva) left the Hotel Mansion
as soon as the white light that beats upon the
plaintiff in a breach-of-promise action had located
her, ana departed for an unannounced address.
Her published portrait puts Carrie, in the matter
of looks, into a seat in the basement amongst the
cobwebs. If it be a good picture, she is a very
pretty young woman.
But there is no liar like the camera, and the
description your friends give you of the person
you haven t seen is often as unreliable as the
camera. Bigwood, as seen at Wednesday’s races
with Carrie (I had not seen him till then), was just
Bigwood not a Percy or a Plantaganet. There
was no more “distinction” about his exteriority
than there is about the average young lorry-driver
or horse-trainer. It may have been the native
worth, but it was not the personal beauty of
1.P.8. that lured the Merry Widow into matri-
mony.
Lord Dudley promises to be thejmost chased
and erawled-after G.-G. that has yet visited these
shores. At the races last week he was pilpably
keen on the running, yet wherever he went male
persons who were nuisances and bores, unless my
physiognomy lore is at fault, trotted doggedly
after him and barked observations at the back of
his neck, to which he hearkened with the strained
smile and the far-away eye of one who is inwardly
muttering the word that is spelt with a dash,
borne of the offenders were racing men them-
selves, and so should have known better. But
the majority were of the class that goes to Rand-
wick in support of its social position. A Society
for the Prevention of Grovelling in Public Places
is a requirement these days. On its formation I
'bhft.ll forward a list of names against whose owners
it is desirable that proceedings should be taken.
Ireland is well represented on the new Governor-
General’s staff. Captain Hore-Ruthven’s ances-
tral home is m co. Wexford. His wife, whom
he wedded only a few weeks before leaving for
Australia, is an Irish girl. She is on her way to
this country with Lady Dudley. Mr. Callan, the
secretary, is Irish, and possesses a brother who is
a priest. Dill is at present abroad, but if he does
not on his return have a word or two to say anent
this glut of Hibermanism in high places he will
disappoint many of his faithful followers.
At her third concert Crossley reminded of a big
glowing chrysanthemum—the kind that goes
through all the richer shades of brown and
merges into gold. A glittering brown haze' over
an underskirt of glimmering brown, gold and
bugle decorations, and silk embroidered storks in
shades of amber and brown ; a stork on the nape
of the Crossley neck—but this gown beats descrip-
tion and is worth going through a thunderstorm
Se f\ , even lf Ada singing inside
it! Adas consort, Dr. Muecke, isn’t a bit
the kind of man who walks in the shadow
of his wife s glory. He has a well-lighted
way of his own running parallel with hers.
Consultant physicians speak most respectfully of
his attainments and of hi§» originality when they
foregather with him at dinner and' drop poly-
syllables in the soup. ‘ 1 J
• \ he h° use . that Dr. Muecke came out of
is heayffy gilded. Muecke, sen., is acknow-
fVrmd, “ 16a f °» • tn ® . blg and prosperous
German colony in S. Australia. He is a mer-
chant and director of nearly all the fattest things
in those parts-the Bank of Adelaide, the Ade-
laide Steamship Co., and the Broken Hill Pro-
prietary mine. The original Australian Muecke
was a doctor, too—a philosophical old gentleman,
a triend of von Mueller’s, who left Germany in its
troubled times, 60 years ago.
The Girls’ Realm Guild put a running knot
around Ada Crossley last week, and, drawing it
tight, trailed her to Baumann’s ballroom, where
she was given tea and handed bunches of music
and admiration, and made a member of the Guild.
■Later she went on to the Wentworth Hotel, where
Mrs. Danvers held a tea-revel in her honor.
“ Louise Dale,” the other half of the Hamilton
Larle brace, would have come along with the
Crossley co. to lift her soprano in song if it had
not been for an eight-months-old infant. The co.
coulan t use baby’s baritone, and Ma would not
come without it. Mr. John Harrison, like Earle,
is a fairly recent bridegroom. He heard by cable
since the tour started of the arrival of a little tenor,
who is very exacting in his demands for lullabies.
Crossley co. left last night for Melbourne, after
a crammed matinee. Because the beknighted
-bent intends to make a speech at the railway
station, the men of the co. will have to arrive in
the southern city in frock-coats and top-hats.
Miss Katharine Goodson has given Melbourne
a sample of her hand on the piano, and next
k.aturday night, at the Town Hall, she will do the
like kindness by Sydney. A modern classical
programme and a special orchestra 70 strong will
assist. n
And talking of music: a cluster of Sydney
meiomaniacs are determined that a Musical Festi-
val is necessary for the education of this land,
twenty citizens of note who have music in their
souls (as well as money in their bank) have
donated £2O each towards its inauguration. It
will be one whole week of music—a debauch of
melody—in which nine concerts will be enshrined.
Promoters hope to have a crowded week of the
kind every three years or so.
Preparation for the Edith and Yera Dickerson
benefit concert is swelling visibly. The two gifted
youngsters, as well as the first-rate assistance
they will have, are deserving of a record audience.
Sydney is to have its “ Messiah,” after all. The
mental fur of the Philharmonic was stroked the
wrong way by Sykes, who slipped in with a
higher tender for the Town Hall; but, prowling
around to find a way out, the Philharmonics
decided on giving the oratorio in the afternoon
instead of at night. Numbers of devout persons in
this Statenever goto any musical festival but “The
Messiah. 1 hey would consider that they were out
of training for the choir invisible if debarred from
listening to “The Lord Omnipotent Reigneth ”
and saying for the manyth time “ Isn’t it lovely!”
Hazon had such a horror of this Handel master-
piece, through sheer weariness of conducting it
®h j he use d to say it had made him an unbeliever
and he took such liberties with the composition
Chorus 6 US6d t 0 Cl ° Se With the Halleh 'j ah
Eighty men and women, who have paid £5OO in
passage money, fell upon Sydney last week, en
route from Brisbane to Mel bourne, to take part in
the Ballarat South-street musical competitions.
I hey swamped the whole of the saloon accommo-
tion (at least, no one but the meiomaniacs
was travelling on the Marloo that trip), so the
competition mania has struck them heavily. They
are the Ipswich Cambrian Society, and the
feminine members are to be guests of Ballarat
citizenesses whilst the musical rivalry rages.
. Sa ' v Tommy Burns last week. He came into
the Cafe Frangais, for lunch, with the Little Bov
from Manly. His solidity of figure, the Napo-
leonism of the upper part of his face, and the sug-
gestion of his jaw being of concrete, was borne
upon every diner present.
The Glaciarium has closed—a fact that will
possibly put Excellencette Rawson into lialf-
mourning of the mind. She enjoyed her skating
more than dancing or any other form of amuse-
ment-enjoyed it even more than her opening of
sales of work or canary shows, or even the inau-
guration of Pure Milk depdts. Miss Madge
Broomfield, who was so shockingly burned through
the ignition of her fancy dress—a cotton wool
vesture intended for the final carnival on the ice—
is recovering.
“Gentle spring in sunshine clad” beamed
upon some persons who had clad themselves
uncommonly at the races. One lady, who makes
it a great appropriation to her own good
parts (to quote Portia’s cumbrous phrase)
that she designs her own frocks, explained that
‘ this one I have on was suggested to me by a
Jive crayfish or lobster as he lay clawing the atmo-
sphere outside a fish shop.” The colors on a live
lobster are as beautiful as those of the darker sorts
of chrysanthemums, ranging from pale yellow to
the brown of an old saddle. So the gown was
artistic and up-to-date in its coloring. The cray-
fish certainly has the fashionable shading—when
he’s of the quick. When of the dead of course
he s scarlet.
One of the most richly-dressed women of the race
week was Mrs. Barney Allen, whose green silk
took a golden glint when she moved. The gold in
the silk was emphasised by gold net and fringe
decorations and wide borders of what looked like
sweet-pea embroidered in grey silk.
“Dejected Widow” Moore’s parasol deserves a
line. It was of light hue, with a deep border of
gondolas in beautiful bright colors. Rose pink
gondolas gliding round and round the rim of a
sunshade in peacock-blue and grass-green water
this is not an everyday vision.
Another novelty, worn by a very slight woman
in an embroidered linen, was a belt (it seemed to
be gold elastic something) with two little flat
pockets or purses, one on either side of the belt-
buckle. She carried her watch in one, and in the
other her money and the return tram ticket.
Mrs. Lady-o -war Napier was, according to a
recent frock-report, gowned in “gun-metal grey ”
It seems a very suitable phrase with which to
describe the frock of a lady wishing to do honor
to the complexion of a cruiser such as the Gib-
raltar. And it exactly describes the color of a
vesture worn by Miss Young in the Dejected
Widow.
The Sam Hordern (senior), with the pretty young
widowed daughter, Mrs. Gaden, will be back in
Sydney early in December.
Mrs Prendergast, a friend and contemporary of
Mrs. Burdekm, Mrs. “ Ted ” Simpson, and other
smart and handsome Sydneyites, is to be re-
married. Her selection is one of the great Vaughan
clan, and his front name is Reginald. Mrs.
Prendergast is the good “Roman” who is essential
in a Vaughan orange-blossoming, and she is, to boot
a woman of wealth Mr. Vaughan is likewise pos-
sessed of much cash, and he has, in addition, nine
Vaughanlettes by a previous marriage. The ladv
has a grown-up son, with whom she visited these
parts half-a-dozen years ago, since when she
has been living in England.
A Commonwealth Conference of Women has
un *? 4l brood u P° n w hat Light-of-Asia Arnold
called the empty eggs of thought,” at St.
J ames Hall. Delegates from various States, 130
strong, with Miss Grace Watson, of Queensland,
holding the ribbons—no, this won’t do at all.
I made made them hens, and now I suggest
that they are ponies. Anyhow, thev have begun
to discuss great questions in relation to God, the
Empire, and the proper feeding of infants. As
the spring lock shuts down on this letter just
when the proceedings open, further enlightenment
is delayed.
.The Stage Society, which has the large and
lordly airn of periodically producing the best
Enghsn, European and Australian drama in
Sydney wiH build “A Doll’s House” at the
Palace I heatre next Saturday afternoon, under all
sorts of distinguished patronage, and for a new
•hanty known as the Infants’ Milk Dispensary.
Mrs. Elsa Buhrow will be the Ibsenish Doll, who
gets that tired feeling about matrimony and slams
the door of her doll’s house upon her astonished
hubby.
Miss Kitty Conway—one of the best—niece of
ex-editor of Argus Watterston, is in Sydney,
seeing how much more gold there is in our sun-
shine and wattle than they have in Bentland.
Kederal Government has, by the way, pur-
chased Mr. Sam Hordern’s steam yacht for the
use of the Customs Department, paying- £l7OO
for it.
The cold, sensible Briton, who has been famed
tor more years than any well-brought-up female
likes to think about for the wearing of flat-heeled
shoes and flannel next the skin, and the consequent
possession of all the’level-headed virtues, seems to
be degenerating some. He (and she) grows
lamentably superstitious. A periodical, The
Mystic, is now actually published in sombre old
Eondon which tells the female Briton what to
wear to prevent the Signs of the Zodiac dropping
on her as she walks down the street. It adver-
tises charms that have been “specially designed
under the best influences of the metals of the
Eenehc Planets.” And here is one of its dress
advertisements:—
Florence Hall,
68 South St., Chichester,
In response to the wishes of a large clientele, has opened
a unique Salon of Millinery for the creation and
supply of
Symbolic Hats and Bonnets,
varying in price from one to five guineas.
Picturesquely made up from Psychic Observation and
Occult Knowledge.
Symbolic Motor Hats,
A Speciality. Half Guinea.
Some useful hints are supplied to females on the
edge of the matrimonial swamp. For instance :
-Nd weeping should take place before the ceremony.
(Mark the cynical italics !)
The underwear should have pale-blue ribbons.
The garters should be white, with pale-blue rosettes in
which a red rosebud lurks.
The lace of underwear or embroideries should always be
emblematic of roses.
The bride should be careful to put her right foot out of
bed first on the wedding morning.
To ensure the bride’s good fortune, she shall enter the
house after the ceremony under two drawn swords placed
in the manner of a St. Andrew’s cross.
It is unlucky for a bride not to shed a tear on parting
with her people.
“ Mario ” from Brisbane :
Brisbane’s bustling Mayor is having no end of trouble
in getting-the apple of his eye to blossom—said apple (to
tear my beautiful simile up by the root) being a town
hall. W e all want a town hall, and have been wanting it
for vears. Long* agfo, in the stone age, designs were
acquired and tenders called. But somehow the matter
slipped the memory of the “fathers” of the day, and
ultimately the tenderers died without getting a reply to
their letters. The same thing happened in' the steel age.
JNow the Mayor says that he will not have further pro-
crastination, but will go right ahead ; and in his bustling
way he is alleged to have overlooked certain regulations
and hurt the feelings of certain aldermen who ventured
to remind him of their existence. .Now, even aldermen
are human, wherefore they are kicking hard, not against
the building of the hall, but really against the Mayor’s
methods, and law and Costs are beginning to be talked
about. Should the law be against his Worship there is
likely to be chaos; and if in his favor, more chaos. Yet
all the trouble could probably be ended if the Mayor
admitted that he had rushed things, and asked for every-
body’s assistance to get the temple up.
His pale and interesting Ex. opened our Art Show in a
grey flannel suit and an air of resolution. He told the
students responsible for the weird anatomical studies to
consider the lilies, so to speak, and to go and sin no more.
Then he applauded Premier Kidston’s idea of sending
pictures round the country towns, but he thought an in-
structor ought to have gone with them to point out their
various points. Godfrey Rivers’ announcement that he
was retiring from the presidentship of the Society was
received with a silence that you could have leaned
against. The fact of the matter is that, rightly or
wrongly, he has been blamed for the row that gave birth
to the new Society of Artists—a break-away that left the
Q.A.S. poor indeed. Brisbane isn’t big enough yet for
two societies, so, not forgetting for a moment the good
work that Godfrey Rivers has done here, there is a feeling
that over his dead presidential body a more sympathetic
man might join the hands of the old andthe new.
Standing out against a background of commonplace
(and worse, as far as oils are concerned) is the study of
Coolangatta Bay, by the sunny-sroiled Percy Grainger
who can get more real sun into his waves than anyone in
Queensland. The champion water-color is also a N.S.W.
subject. Just a bit of the Illawarra coast; just a bit of
beach—but it lives. ■
Miss Ada Wiggs Dwyer, of the Cabbage Patch, has
hit the Brisbane public “right there,” and has been
accorded a tearful send-off after a record season. The
Hazy lady and the study of elongated stripes have also
been strongly urged to come again, and the Stubbins
drunk makes the waybacks green with envy. Ada Cabbage
Patch has been collecting black opals, making friends all
round, and (she says) eating far too much pineapple.
Isn’t the sublime confidence of youth a joy to behold ?
And when it is combined with curlv hair and an artistic
turn of mind, it’s just irresistible. The story goes here that
a critic paid a visit to the studio of a very young artist,
and remarked upon the work, “ You follow that soft
Dutch, school, don’t you ? I like it.” Dimples smiled
pityingly. “Oh no!” he said, “mine are very like
Turner’s.”
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

The pig-tailed gentleman who leaves his
Joss-ridden land with the idea of disposing of
the “ spling callot ” at the kitchen door of Maori-
land is to be severely mauled by the M.L. Cus-
toms Department on and after October 23. From
that date onward all Chinese who wish to enter
Maoriland will have to read any piece of English
print selected at the discretion of the Customs
officers. Said officials have been specially in-
structed to see that the law is fulfilled to the
letter, and it is believed that as a result the
Celestial inflow will dwindle greatly. In fact it is
hoped that 50 years will see the Chow counted
right out in Maoriland.

the young infant.
They are as’ easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns.
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Allenburys” Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture cf the most desirable Motor Tyres—and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,” and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to be certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.
CONTINENTAL TYRES
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 12, 1908.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Carrie Moore’s mamma is very angry with her
star offspring. Mamma was looking forward to
the arrival of future son-in-law Proctor with some
anxiety. (What devoted parent would not ? He
has £30,000 a year !) She had pictured Carrie
developing into a rich matron without delay, and
Hinging afar all frivolous footlighted ambition.
Mrs. Moore was quite enthusiastic in her first-
voiced objections to Mr. Proctor’s successful rival,
and her sympathy for the lady who missed him.
Miss Salvin s side of the case has its tragic
features. A quiet and dainty little woman—
younger even than the volatile Carrie—she has
quite a number of accomplishments. Amongst
other things, she knows enough about horses and
clogs to judge at an agricultural show. The lady
is somewhat frail in health, worse luck, though.
Herself she says nothing that is not forced from
Her at the point of a reporter’s pencil. The word
Higwood henceforth is dropped from her voca-
bulary, which proves the girl to be something of a
plucky one. For she won’t be easily able to forget
the years she spent in the soft radiance of Percy
iJantagenets smiles; the remembrances of that
time will live with her.
Caulfield revealed nothing startling on Satur-
day , for the weather clerk was bad-tempered in
the morning. New chiffons were, therefore,
popped back in the boxes, and out came the old
tween-seasons garb for another airing. A hat or
two of cartwheel dimensions caused some bad
language, but there were none of the nerve-shock-
ing startlers we read about in English papers.
Ihe most startling things were Mrs. Les-
lie Macdonald’s grass-green stockings. They
matched her hat of emerald hue, and this
capped a perfectly ripping dark-blue face-cloth
coat and skirt of a beautiful shade, and
cut in the latest mode, with black silk braid galore
to set it off. The G.-G. was there, but no other
viee-regals. With the G.-G. were the members
of his very correctly turned-out staff, all showing
a decided waist. There was quite a family bunch
of Maddens, of whom, on this occasion, Beatrice
was the swell. She aired a striking Empire frock
of a deep raspberry hue, with much oriental silk
embroidery on white all about the shoulders and
meandering a bit down the arms and back
Ihe youngest Cliveden hope, Miss Ivy, sported
like Mrs. Ernest Raleigh) one of those sat-upon
looking hats, hers being black, wreathed with
pink roses. She was a very particular swell in
her bridesmaid frock, a thing of cream with a
clash of pale pink underneath, and a sparkle of
silver or crystal—perhaps both—about the shoul-
ders which suggested chain-mail. From the pink
sash of several tones dangled crystal and silver
tassels. One of the Baillieu boys, who are
steadily climbing since they blossomed forth at
the Glacianum, was in devoted attendance.
Considering it was race week in Sydney
Sassiety was very well represented. For, during
Sydney race week, it is the thing here not to be
If you ,f re , not , ln Sydney, you ought
to be. In all the bunch that was there
tliere was nothing to cause a thrill, ex-
cept the wonderful ermine coat and muff—the
l ,' l r ttei ; T /' L : arl y as big as herself-worn by
Mrs. W. Finlay. The Grices, and Mrs. UrquharJ
the Ihomas laits, Mrs. Dunbar Hooper, Mrs
George Paxton, Mrs. Tom Smith and one of her
daughters Miss Muriel Gumming, the Fred
Paynes, the Frank Madden family, also the
Bowes Kellys, the George Fairbairns, Mrs. Bal-
main and Mrs. R. Casey were a few representa-
tives noted—although it is a dreadful thing to
mention all of them in one paragraph. Mrs.
Casey was one of the best-dressed women in a
mushroom-tinted marquisette and lace dress and
.nat all en suite , as fashion journals say.
Among other things of note was Mrs. Guv
Sherwood s limp. She was a fashion study in a
tailor-built nattier blue cloth, black braid and
silver buttons. Now, is a limp to become fashion-
aT,®’ 1 wonder as it was long ago in the days of
The Alexandra ’? Striped skirts with plain
colored coats were another notable thing. Two of
them were dazzlers, and caused one to wonder if
one by any chance saw double. When the
wearers were in repose they were all right—one a
black t other a blue frock. When the wearers
walked, though, the skirts sprang into pronounced
stripes.
Artist George Lambert and his missus, fired by
the triumph of Brother Streeton, are going to
make a descent upon this country. Thereafter
I s’pose, they’ll return to London laden with cash
cajoled from the few Australian pockets that
aren t guarded by unsesthetic minds. George
wears a Velasquez beard, these days; which is
carrying imitation into the realms of flattery with
a vengeance. But perhaps the chin hair is an
unconscious plagiarism of the gifted Spanish dead
un, whose spook so powerfully influences Lam-
bert s portrait groups.
Reg Carey, who t’other day was a small boy in
knickers, is producing Tittell Brune’s perform-
ances for J.C.W. this season. And the youth is
doing it without a hitch in the curtain or fits in
the wings The Carey boy is son of ponderous,
reliable old George Carey, who struts his hour in
bellow-drama mostly.
They’re a business-like community in Mel-
bourne. After their Fleet spree, they’re bein°- as
dilatory as a bankrupt in paying the piper The
orchestra, which played while Tom Bent slapped
bperry on the back and attempted to talk as
though he were a drummer fresh from Detroit
hadn t been paid when I last heard their loud im’
patmnt wails. Neither had a number of other
people.
There is one man,in Melbourne whose fortune
piles up daily under one’s very eyes—Showman
West. He has been specialising in Picture Shows
for years, and his continuous films grow lon°- e r
and longer at each new venture, and claw out like
octopus tentacles to draw in every subject under
the sun. Since he has annexed Olympia (that
vast barn built to the worship of Circus) the
I ictures have run the gamut, from mere mad
practical jokes to material for world-interest.
After the latest fight, the bruisers were bashing
each other on his screens almost before the
details were exploited in the papers. The
Olympian Games were re-played before the real
subject had dropped from the fickle public mind.
But the news-of-the-moment pictures that flash
freshly into the programme make only an item
Ihere is dustless, smooth travelling through
miles and miles of country and city streets, with
hardly a flicker,to disturb the impressive effect of
grey battlements or grim buildings, or' all the
life and gaiety of places it would take Years and a
fortune to ferret out. Or an industry "is followed
from first to last.
The crowd’s that do the rolling-up are mar-
vellous. Every night the hundreds of seats in the
big circus ring are crowded, and the “really circus”
seats, up in the amphitheatre, are packed with
gapers in the dim light. In the outer horse-ring,
where once the leopard prowled the full length of
his cage, and the lion roared, are tea-tables and
bars for the gentle ginger-pop. It is a wonderful
and unique spectacle, this taming of the crowd !
West has never let up on the real showman
touch—a man at a megaphone shouts the pro-
-BK?SQ?,pieoe - * s rnere Jy an enlarged edition
ot Roll U P. roll up,” which West himself has
shouted to a small show in an exhibition. The
real shovvman is passing, but he is very much
alive while West runs his little earth.
Changes are mooted in the Musgrove-Wren
combination. The present opera co. will proba-
bly be split into two, and the halves will get some
imported additions. One east will be entirely
grand opera, the other comic opera. The
change is likely to give Miss Stella Gastelle, the
gay little soubrette, more freedom. In “ Les
Cloches ’ she was like a butterfly trying to draw
along a fat, stagey Lohengrin. There are men in
that company with excellent voices, but they
move as though they had all the weight of grand-
opera tradition in their boots.
Miss Stella Gastelle is an astronomical point of
particular brightness. She is a most vivacious
sdubrette. To all appearances, she looks on the
Australian trip as a break in the habit of playing
L.t I oupee a habit which has lasted solidly
f or years- Since she opened in “Les Cloches”
in Melbourne she has been in hospital with
a “throat’’-resting for a future sparkle
which the management is cogitating. She is
a piquant little piece of goods, and made
herself most popular with the army of the chorus,
ror her part, she says she has never met such
chorus girls in any part of the world as the Aus-
tralian; their voices, and their life, and their
adaptability, she says, are the most welcome sur-
prise to one who knows that a chorus girl is so
often just a singing machine with movable joints.
Mr. Levilly, the lady’s husband and one-time
manager (she is the manager now), came to Aus-
tralia just to see her off the boat—stayed three
weeks, and then went back to his London and his
clubs. He was manager of the “La Poupee ”
provincial tour, in which Miss Gastelle played
lead. Her Alesia was responsible for the record-
breaking run of the quaint play. She has
played the part so much, from its very inception
that sometimes she forgets whether she is a
mechanical doll or a real live woman.
Miss Gastelle, though English born, studied for
ma ny youthful years in Leipsic and Paris. She
returned for a first London engagement at the
I mice of Wales Theatre, and was an immediate
and continuous success. She has had her successes
m pantomime, too, both in London and at Mr.
Wyndnam s Theatre in Glasgow ; but she prac-
tically created Alesia of “La Poupee,” and that
is her favorite r6le. Brilliant press notices follow
her trail m this like so many meteors. Even The
-Limes waxed almost enthusiastic, and told London
managers that, if “ they thought of reviving the
favorite operas of Offenbach, there was one°ladv
on the. English stage equal to playing and singing
the leading parts as they should be sung and
played—that is Stella Gastelle.”
The Sandringham Golf Tournament has ter-
minated, and there is a lull among excited girls
with stretched faces, and with golf caps on the
back of their wind-tossed hiar. Miss Elsternwick
-Kell carried off the win for the Doubles. The
other girls have flopped down in a heap, and
won t even polish their brassies. Some girls
within my ken were so keen in practising that
they had ■to “chuck” theatres and evening
frivols; they were that cat-tired they went to
bed at half-past eight every night, to be ready for
an early tramp. You’d meet them on a drizzly
grey day, when the atmosphere embraced one
with an icy grip. They’d merely chortle and say,
Glorious day for play—so nice and soft under-
foot !
That frocky Toorakety duet, the Macleod
Girls, usually in full blast at race time in Sydney
or Melbourne or Hobart, must be missed at Rand-
Wick this season. The girls deserted Melbourne
-tSJoek and fashionable cafes some weeks since for
Sydney and the Australia; but thev clipped the
races, and are rusticating at a station on some
wind-swept plain not a far coo-ee from Svdney.
One is clinging hard to the speedy wings of health
after a nervous break up—or,-break down.
The Willie a’Becketts have moved their furni-
ture—solid old mahogany—and their ox and their
aSS i nlu i, r man-servant and their maid-servant,
and I he Baby, from Toorak haunts to the country
hills of Berwick, far enough out for Baby to play
with woody bears, yet near enough to the city for

ear on business interests.
Medico Smith’s clever daughter Louise, who
has been travelling over the byways and high-
ways of England and Scotland, has planted her
baggage at Edinburgh University, and is at the
moment splashing about in a course of Modern
Languages and Phonetics. One evening everv
week the girl-students hold a meeting in the
Royal Arch Hall to talk —not only with the elec-
tric ease of their mother tongue, but in any old
(or new) language they like or dislike. When the
meeting really gets going, the Tower of Babel
may as well scratch itself for all engagements.
Margaret Anglin patronises Callot Soeurs of
Paris, for her gowns. At that place they just fit
linings around one’s fairy form and then wind the
stuff on one. After that they wind up the bill.
Ihere is a legend that it takes two maids to put
Margaret into her frocks.
Margaret Anglin Camilled in splendid frocks
the loveliest, in my idea, being a lace one
divided into panels, with lines of gold thread in it
which veiled a floral chine silk. The richest was
of white satin embroidered with pearls, and inlet
with net panels thickly incrusted with pearl em-
broideries. This was worn in the ballroom scene
with lots of jewels, including a diamond- tiara!
Miss Anglin does away with the village-maid
attire in the cottage scene, and wears a beautiful
white ninon frock inlet with lace and made over
mauve silk. In nighties—but she does not get out
of bed to show theya off ! 6

From “Fosna,” in Adelaide
As usual, the Hunt Club races drew the champion
frocking to Morphettville. Any frill that has been pre-
Razed U P°” hy man, woman or cat is disqualified
tor this event; and for weeks beforehand the local woman
becomes a fearsomely secretive being who lurks. The
grand piano (which ought to have been given for the very
best frocky outburst, but wasn’t) is hereby divided as
follows keyboard to the graceful young Bymill dame,
who wore a heliotrope empire raiment and black plumed
millinery glory ; case to Mrs. Clem Hill, in pale-blue
chinon over lace, and more plumed millinery ; pedal to
a rothenngham damsel, in a pink glacb empire triumph,
with yoke of Honiton lace, and still more plumed mil-
linery; and the remainder of the instrument can be cut
into slices for Mrs. Jule Wendt (black and white check
costume, with a fetching touch of green about it) and
Mrs. Parsons (gorgeous lace over white glace, with some
thing more than usually intense in the matter of girdles).
The weather had its best clothes and complexion on, ana
the riding was as weird as usual.
The velvet-clad Cherniavski boys were by no means the
least picturesque items on the lawn, and came in for a
large slice of feminine attention. They own to belonging
to a family of nine, all champion noisers, including a baby
who sings. e 3
The youngsters gave five concerts during the week, and
the crowd brought out its encore newly oiled and wound
up, and half-killed the boys with hard work. If every
performer doesn’t respond to every encore every time
Adelaide feels annoyed. For once the populace kept its
senses firmly under its hat, and didn’t cast “ floral offer-
ings ’ at the defenceless boys ; but Madame Hooton came
m for some gorgeous vegetables every night. Their Exes,
took a party along to the first concert, and the Bevans,
Bass6s, and the Mus. Doc. Davies were among the
musical lights that illuminated each performance.
Mr. Dick Nitchske’s burst of melody on the 7th was a
more than usually fine burst, and disclosed the fact that
the Adelaide baritone has done great things with his
warble since he took it to London to be polished. He
was always popular here, and a great house turned up
and gave him a bumper reception. Elsie
piano-stroking, Nora Kyffin Thomas’ fiddling, and Martha
Bruggeman’s soprano warble also gladdened the already
very glad audience ; and each damsel found an encore and
some floral rewards waiting.
Mr. and Mrs. Nitchske have been handing out some
very excellent advice to young* musical career hunters*
the gist of it is, “ Stay in Australia unless you have much
money and more influence.” Without both of these thin ms
engagements are very hard to lasso, and starvation Is
career that most adventurers find in the Big Smoke.
The Nitchskes speak with some authority, too, for thev
have kept in touch with pretty well the whole fraternity of
Australian musical and artistic folk, to whom their house
in London was always hospitably open. Mrs. Nitchske has
gone out and collected more than one sick young fellow-
country-woman, and nursed her back to health. Fore-
most of all the comparatively new immigrants she places
the success of the just-returned Victorian damsel, Ilita
Mope, whose progress she says was quite remarkable.
The P. and O. Co. has come down from its high estate
and will allow its mailboats to tie themselves up to the
Outer Harbor, instead of standing aloof at the ancient and
sometimes boisterous Semaphore anchorage. The Mooltan
was the first to dare it, and the doughty deed was cele-
brated by a luncheon on board. Premier Price W'ent
down and shook the Mooltan by the mast, and patted it
on the binnacie, and said it was a good beast Then
everybody drank someone else’s health and said it was an
event of national importance. Not to be outdone the
N.D.L. boat pushed its nose in on Thursday, and was tied
to the Harbor too.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

IN THE HOME.
A vast amount of human misery is
endured by thousands of men and
women who are never really well.
Headache, sickness, nervous depres-
sion, dislike of food, sinking sensa-
tions, with distressing dizziness and
weakness, make life a daily misery
to such sufferers. And the cause is
indigestion—a stomach that starves
the body, because it cannot digest
sufficient food to keep it well, and
leaves the mind weak, irritable,
depressed. To euch unhappy ones
Mother Seigel’s Syrup brings a mes-
sage of hope, brings the ready help
to health, brings the quiet, strong
sense of confidence which only
health can give—health re-made
and regained, through sound diges-
tion. Take it daily after meals.
Mr. J. Fitzgibbon, x, Hugo Street, Redfern,
N.S.W., writing on March 18th, 1908, says:
“ For years I suffered most severely from
acute indigestion. Nothing did me any good
until I got Mother Seigel’s Syrup. The
first bottle enabled me to eat and digest,
and soon I was quite cured.”

Two of the three olive-trees which were the be-
ginning- of the olive-oil industry of S. Australia are still in
bearing ; in fact, they seem to have just begun to find
out what real bearing is. Just on 50 years ago the three
plants were brought out from Prance. At first they were
tried near Adelaide, but didn’t thrive. Then Samuel
Davenport—a fine old colonist, still alive—got permission
to transplant two of them at Burnside. That was 45
years ago. For some seasons past the harvest from them
has been steadily increasing ; and now they have knocked
out all records by giving between them over 12cwt. of
fruit, worth Bs. per cwt. —less 2s. 6d., the cost of picking.
They still belong to the Davenport-Clelana family.

yielded most gold and profit that year. The output
(bringing Rickard’s figures to sterling) was £1,606,017;
the profit £967,000. In 1907, however, the Goldfield Con-
solidated (Nevada) came first in output and the Robinson
(Transvaal) in profit. There were in 1906 three Rand
mines (Robinson, Simmer and Jack, and Robinson Deep)
which gave each a yield of over $4,000,000 ; in Australasia
there were two (Mt. Morgan and Waihi). In the matter
of profit, however, only the Robinson beat either the
Waihi or the Oroya-Brown Hill (Kalgoorlie).

The fact that garments made of red fabrics offer
better protection from the sun than clothing of any
other shade is now generally recognised, and a craze is
setting in for having tropical garments of a gory hue.
The new apparel is colored with scientific accuracy, and
is guaranteed to resist the harmful (i.e., blue or actinic)
rays of the sun, while freely admitting the beneficial
(or non-actinie) ones. The time was when man was con-
tent to accept the sunshine just as Providence poured it
down on him, but nowadays he filters the light of the
world with rags, and only uses as much of it as he thinks
good for him. Some of these days Providence will get
irritated at the amount of knowledge mankind is accumu-
lating, and will send along a second Deluge as a mild
reproof. Then humanity and its impertinent discoveries
will be wiped out, and Ignorance will rage through the
land with mud in its hair.

“Itan”: The North Queensland canefields
are pretty “ white” now, but the banana plantations are
as yellow as ever. What is the Australian Parliament
going- to do about the fruit that looks like a sausage?
This banana trade is a big industry, and should be a white
man’s industry ; but Ah Fat and Ho Stink have got it by
the wool, and are holding' on with characteristic tenacity.
The white man, in the present circumstances, cannot suc-
ceed, because the Chow has the trade cornered. He
cornered it while the Tory prevaricator was declaring
some years ago that white men could not work in the
tropics. There are miles of country where not a single
white is employed. Then the product is handled by the
yellow ring of middlemen. It is largely due to this fact
that bananas have been sold at such a big price for the
past few years. When the yellow grower employs any
help he induces the aboriginal to fill the bill, and pays
him in rations—and opium 1 Immature fruit is flung on
the market, because the Chow ring is supreme, and can
command a sale even for that sort of stuff. Another
reason why the Chow picks his immature stuff is that
directly the fruit begins to fill out the fly attacks it. The
State law enjoins that each bunch must be enclosed in a
net, but as there is practically no supervision, the sinful
Chow only envelopes the bunches on the outside of the
rows, and picks the rest green in order to save their lives.

A towheaded girl with scraps of faded ribbon
all over her came into the shop, sidled up to the counter,
and said :
“ Baker, ma says to call at our place on Monday ; No.
24 Horse-street.”
“ Yes,” replied the baker, in a non-committal tone, and
the girl went out.
“ A new customer for you ? ” I commented.
“ No. I ain’t going to call,” he said, defiantly. “ I’m
just about sick of pas and mas. For the last two years
I’ve kept a record ; and wherever the kids call the missus
‘ ma,’ there’s a bad time for the butcher and baker. I’ve
only got two ‘ ma ’ families on my list that pay their way.
If the nippers label the old man ‘dad’ and the mother
‘ mum ’ the prospect’s fairly good. Most likely they’re
poor ; but they’re battlers, and don’t waste money in
style. But the most reliable customers are those where
they call them ‘ father ’ and ‘ mother.’ When a youngster
comes to the shop and says, ‘ Mother wants you to call,
baker,’ I’m there bright and early.
“ They’re crafty, too, the pas and mas,” continued the
baker. “ Perhaps they’ll pay cash for a few days. Then
they'll pay weekly. After a while they’ll pay for half a
week and let the other half stand over. Then they get a
week behind, and soon they owe you for a month’s bread.
Then the band starts. You never see ‘ma ’ these times.
The little girl takes the bread and says,‘Pa will call
round at the shop with the money.’ But pa never calls.
Father always calls, and sometimes I see dad ; but pa has
never been in my shop except once, and that was to
threaten to punch me for daring to ask his wife for my
money.
“Ma is generally worse than pa. Pa usually blusters
and threatens ; but ma sometimes uses violence. At one
place they owed me £1 165., which is a lot for a suburban
family. I. tried all sort's of dodges, but never got a
bean. They lived in one of those ramshackle, two-storey,
single-fronted villas —ma mostly lives in a villa. One
morning, when I was standing patiently in the rain, wait-
ing at the door, I heard the window above me opened.
I looked up, and a whole bucketful of slops fell on top of
me. That sickened me of mas, and I fired a blue paper
at her next day.”

“ C.K. Y.” : Sydney mathematical experts have
just proved the truth of Tommy Brusso Burns’ dictum
that there is no money in poultry-ranching. An analysis
of the returns at the recent laying competitions shows
that the profits of the business are not worth talking
about. Even the breeders of champion strains are going
out of the biz. Like the pig, the chook only pays as a
consumer of waste—she is a by-product, not a staple
crop. Hundreds of dotty victims have spent their little
all finding out this simple truth.

“R. Snick ” : As a licensed pharmaceutist, I see
something of the patrician dame with a poodle, dachshund,
or other canine outrage of the sort. I may mention that
I can't see too much of her for my pocket’s sake. This is
the sort of missive I get periodically, to my great joy.
iiogville, , ’OS.
Dear Mr. R. Snick,
My poor Ponto is very sick. Will you come and see
him?
Yours, etc., D. Ixgo.
I call, and am shown an unsavory mongrel in an ad-
vanced state of mange. “Yes, madam,” I say thought-
fully, “ though your dog is in a very serious state, I think
I can cure him, if I have him continuously under my
care. You must let me take him to my canine hospital.”
After a while the lady acquiesces, and I call a cabman,
and order him to transport the hound to his vehicle.
There are a few muttered objurgations, but I jingle the
coins in my pocket, and at the sound Jehu plucks up the
pup and heaves him inside. Arrived home, I tie the bald
bulldog in the yard and feed the invalid on sulphur and
water. In ten days I return him a clean dog. Fee, two
guineas. But overfeeding and want of exercise do their
deadly work, and later on I receive a notification that
“ poor Ponto hasbeeome so, yes, so positively objectionable
that I have most reluctantly consented to his destruction.”
Ponto, hairless, wheezy and odoriferous as the Yarra
during the dog-days, is brought to my shop by the gar-
dener. I insert a drachm of prussic acid into him.
Finis. Fee, one guinea. One guinea, mind ! —for a dog.
Why, I’d poison half-a-dozen men for that.
Alexander Hay, of Coolangatta, will con-
test the New England (N.S. W.) seat next Federal
elections in the somewhat busted cause of Anti-
Sosh. Laborite F. J. Foster roundly beat Lons-
dale there in 1906, and Hay’s chances of doing the
same by Foster are dull. Foster was an unknown
man when he won ; he is now widely known and
liked. The wiped-out Lonsdale had an intimate
acquaintance with the constituency, and what he
didn’t know (for all his congenital foolishness in
other matters) about electioneering tactics wasn’t
worth bothering about. The local Anti-Sosh
organisations were in full bloom when Lonsdale
slumped; to-day they have mostly withered on
the stalk, and the Labor leagues are, contrariwise,
in a flourishing state. Hay contested the Illa-
warra seat (an appreciable section of which
belongs to the Hay family) eight years ago, but
was beaten out of sight by Gr. W. Fuller.
THE RUINED MARINERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When in latitude 20deg. south, a large quantity of
“ grease ” was seen floating on the surface of the ocean,
and, a calm prevailing, th e_men _ man aged to sco©p--up
several bucketfuls of the stuff. The “ grease ” was found
excellent, and it was used for slushing down the masts,
the balance being used by the men on their oilskins and
boots. The captain said that much more could have been
collected, but thought the amount picked up by the men
was enough.
It was not until a few days after the arrival of the
Antrope at San Francisco that the master of the vessel
learned that he had let a fortune slip through his fingers.
A small part of the “grease” had heen saved, and this
was identified by an Oakland druggist as ambergris. The
sailors had greased masts, sea boots and oilskins with
ambergris, valued at approximately £BO a pound, and
thus wasted about £4500 worth of the stuff.— Daily

BEALE Australian Pianos are made in Australia under special systems and with valuable patents which greatly enhance
the musical qualities, as well as increase the durability of the instrument. The systems and practices of European and
American manufacturers are well known to us, and where they are perfectly satisfactory we use them, but in many
instances we have been able to improve on the methods of those makers, and have invented new processes in the manufacture,
and new apparatus in the pianos themselves.
Foreign makers have for many years sought a workable metal wrest-plank, but it remained for Beale & Co. to arrive at the
only really satisfactory solution of the difficulty. With the Beale-Vader patent steel tuning-system, pianos will remain per-
manently in tune after once the wires have fully stretched ; the wrest pins cannot possibly become loose, nor can the
wrest-plank split, and thus allow the instrument to get out of tune. Beale horizontal pianos do not require tuning before each
concert, as other grand pianos do, and the tone also of our instruments is superior, having no metallic ring. Our patented
system of building the cabinet-work completely obviates cracking and v/arping—even in the most extreme climates. Our
hexagonal bass-strings ensure pure tones in the bass, with no possibility of a “jingle.”
We have not enough space to enter into further details, but we shall be glad to send full particulars to anyone interested,
whether an intending buyer or not.

A SLUGGISH LIVER
Made Operative by the use op Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Piles.
Mr. John Butler, of 211 Kent Street, Sydney,
having' suffered from a sluggish liver, and fre-
quently from indigestion and constipation, tells of
the wonderful and permanent effects obtained by
using Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, which
correct the liver, but do not gripe, and restore the
bowels to a normal and healthy condition, thus
overcoming constipation naturally and per-
manently.
ĥ
Mr. John Butlkr.
(From a photo.)
“Having used Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills
as a corrective for a slug-
gish liver,” he states, “and
occasionally for indiges-
tion, I can assure you that
there is no better remedy.
I was in the habit of tak-
ing Epsom Salts, and from
time to time I tried other
medicines, but none have
proved so effectual or per-
manent in their results as
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. They do not gripe—
like other physics, which
usually open the bowels
once and leave you just as constipated again the fol-
lowing day. Your pills restore the bowels to a nor-
mal and healthy condition, without causing pain,
or weakening the system.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching
remedy. They reach the liver as no other medi-
cine does. They put a move in your bowels,
strength into the kidneys, and life into your liver,
bracing up the nerves and muscles, toning up the
stomach, stimulating the circulation, and impart-
ing health and energy through the medium of a
well-regulated-system.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A. J.C. Spring Show scraps : Third day saw only
56 starters out of 145 carded, and on the last day only 55.
Possibly the fact that the V. A.T.C. meeting- began on the
same day as Randwick fixture closed had something, but
not all, to do with the falling off. Visiting nags gathered
six races only—M.L. five (through Aeolus, Pilot and
Soultline), and Queensland one (through War Star). Nine-
teen winners were trained in N.S.W. Mooltan topped the
prize list ; his haul being £4276 (for three wins) of the
£21,244 offered. Among stallions represented, Positano
(four wins) beat Grafton by one. W. McLachlan had six
winning mounts, and M.L. cross-country rider T. Cahill
was up on Aeolus and Pilot in all tiieir successes. Biggest
local prize winner was “Mr. C. Jeffries,” who called for
£2028, through Parsee’s Derby triumph. Mundoie’s time
(lmin. 38|sec.) for Suburban Handicap Mile on Wednes-
day was but Jsec. slower than Charles Stuart’s Australian
best, and yet he didn’t finish among the first eight in The
Shorts on the previous Monday. Truly the racehorse
problem is extremely difficult. Stated that A.J.O. will
lose on the venture, as takings were much less than for
same meeting last year. Peru’s Randwick Plate (2J miles)
on Saturday occupied 3min. 56fsecs., and lowered Lord
Ullin’s Daughter’s Australian best—4min. 57Jsecs. Maori-
larid’s fastest is 3min. 56 l-ssecs., accomplished by Sea
Horse.
* * •*
M.L. nagu Aeolus and Pilot gathered all four
A.J.O. jumping events, and they were the only two
jumpers sent over to compete. Aeolus evidenced unques-
tioned superiority in both hurdles, showing greater speed
than anything opposed to him, and flew at least as
well as the best of the others. Grafnax threatened
trouble for Pilot in each steeple till the Syd-
neyite mulled the second-last obstacle on the first
day, and the last on the concluding day; but once
there was a difference of 2st. 101 b. in Grafnax’s favor, and
4st. next time. Pilot’s displays were a revelation to
Australian racegoers, who certainly never previously saw
anything better. iloth horses were sold before their
second efforts. Aeolus went into the possession of crack
bowler, billiard-player, and general all-round sport, Mr.
W. Lyons, for £2OO and £5O from the prize ; and Dr. Fred
Watson secured Pilot for 300 gs. Possibly Aeolus will be
given a chance on the flat, and he should succeed if
placed with good judgment.

Q.T.C. still struggles. Latest meeting showed
a loss of £197.
i* * * *
Seemingly the A. J.C. handicapper made no mis-
take in weighting Melodrama as a proved non-stayer.
Last year the son of Grafton and Drama received Bst. 71b.
in the Epsom Handicap, and Bst. 41b. in the Metropolitan.
He won the mile race and finished third for the Metropoli-
tan, the 101 b. penalty bringing his weight up to 9st.
This year he was handicapped at 9st. for the Epsom, and
only Bst. for the longer race. Again he won the Epsom,
and earned a 101 b. penalty for the Metropolitan, but this
time he carried his Sst. iolb. no nearer than seventh at
the finish. Roughly speaking, the difference between
eight furlongs and 12 in the distance makes a difference
of about 211 b. in Melodrama’s “form.”
On the other hand, what a good one is Mooltan
over a distance ! Last year Melodrama gave the Positano
horse 191 b. in the Epsom, and beat him by a head.
Allowing that the light boy failed to get every
possible ounce out of Mooltan, there was no
denying the fact that he had a good run,
and was decisively “pipped” at the finish. In
the Metropolitan, with 291 b. the best of the weights,
Mooltan gave Melodrama a 141 b. beating. This year he
improved immensely on that performance. Carrying
9st. 21b. (or 311 b. more than last year’s burden) he won
easily, whilst Melodrama (Bst. 101 b.) lagged far behind.
And in the meantime he had run second to Apologue for
the Melbourne Cup. The book shows that whereas a bit
of extra weight has made no difference to Mooltan’s
speed, every bit of extra distance over a mile has been in
his favor. With only two exceptions thus far, this real
good horse has finished first or second every time he has
started. If he keeps well until Melbourne Cup day, he
should run first or second for the two-mile prize. True,
9st. 121 b. is a steadier, but it is 71b. less than Carbine
carried four lengths ahead of a big field, and for all that
has been proved to the contrary, Mooltan may have Car-
bine’s capacity for carrying weight.
-<••***
The Y.A.T.C. made a good commencement
with the Cup meeting at Caulfield on Saturday, notwith-
standing that it clashed with the tail end of the Rand-
wick fixture. In so far that the two odds-on favorites
won handsomely, and the most fancied of the youngsters
scored in the Debutant Stakes, the public had nothing to
complain of. Moreover, it got a considerable education
in the relative “form” of the local and visiting nags,
which is likely to be confirmed next Saturday. Take, for
instance, the runaway victory of Soultline in the
Toorak Handicap. At Randwick, a week earlier,
the son of Soult had seemed to fail in the
Epsom for lack of stamina, the mile in lmin. 39Jsec.
being apparently more than he could manage. His
weight for the Toorak Handicap was 171 b. more than he
carried for the Epsom, yet, wdth a field of Victorian
horses against him, a somewhat heavy course, and con-
sequently slower pace conditions, Soultline (with 9st. 11b.
up) was far too good for- the opposition. He stayed out
the mile and finished as though he could have gone a lot
further. Enchanteur, from Westralia, ran a couple
of lengths behind the w'inner, whilst the name
of a dozen local competitors was simply Mud.
Had he only Victorian horses to meet in the;
Caulfield Cup, the 12 furlongs might not be too far
for Soultline, nor is it clear, from Saturday’s showing,
that he is a non-stayer in even the fastest company.
Maybe he was trained a little too fine for the Epsom, and
if so, the interruption of the journey to Melbourne has
benefited the Maorilander. He is a gelding, and geldings
run best w'hen they are not quite “ strung up.”
Of the 2-year-olds, that lined tip for the Debu-
tant Stakes, the best-looking was Sol Green’s Santos, w-ho
ran badly. The colt seemed very short of work, and may
be expected to do better at the V.R.C. meeting.
* * * *
This scribe would have preferred Parsee to any-
thing that is left in the Caulfield Cup, but, with the
Sydney Derby winner scratched, it is only reasonable to
fancy Pink ’Un, without recommending the Maorilander
as a good investment at anything less than 4to 1. Pink
’Un, given a fair share of luck, may beat lolaire,
Post Town and the Field, w-hich last is not un-
likely to come to the rescue of the noisy brethren who
lay a bet extra agin’ the favorite.
* * * *
“0.K.”: In the language of stable boys the
term “ bloke ” is applied indiscriminately to man and
gee-gee. After the Steeplechase at Caulfield last Satur-
day, a mannikin who had been looking at the race
returned to his mate in the birdcage with the news that
“ one bloke broke his neck, and another bloke broke ’is
leg.” The victims were Melinite and Mayo, and the riders
had escaped without injury.

A writer in Sydney Daily Telegraph (8/10/’08)
illustrates how badly backers fare at the hands of Ikey
Mo in comparison with their experience with the tote.
He shows how in a field of 12 starters, a horse with 59
bets registered against it would pay (through the machine)
a dividend of 23 to 1. What bookmaker, the tote enthu-
siast asks, would pay such odds? He took a fancy case,
when there was a real-life one at his disposal. In
Adelaide, when the totalisator was first installed there,
an aged farmer put £1 on a horse named D.O.D. The
horse won, and the agriculturist’s dividend was 800 to 1.
What howler of the odds since welshing was first invented
ever laid such a wager as that ? A tragic side of the story
is that the winner failed to hold on to his £BOO. He was
in financial difficulties at the time, and the whole of his
wealth was seized on behalf of his creditors.

This season’s football competition in Bendigo
(Vic.) is closing with a shindy. Long Gully and Eagle-
hawk fought out the final match for the premiership.
Eaglehawk won : whereat sundry players from the Gully
were accused of being dead, although they didn’t fail
down, and the alleged dead ’uns, fearing trouble, did an
undignified bolt into a neighboring pub, where a troop of
puffing policemen guarded them. Next day the air was
full of whirling statements that the ’Hawks had squared
prominent Gull.vites. One man was said to have been
given £1 every time he kicked the ball out of bounds.
The secretary was accused of using persuasion with Gui’y
players, and a lot of other more or less vague yarns went
flying about. The Bendigo Football Association held a
meeting, and wiped out for life a Long Gully player from
Maldon ; the Eaglehawk secretary was given to under-
stand that he was guilty of something not too clearly
specified, a. number of other players were either dis-
qualified or cautioned, and more charges are to be in-
vestigated. Altogether the season has left a nasty taste
in the mouth of the goldfields football follower.

Adelaide again claims the club premiership of
this continent in the Australian code of football, although
S. A. was so badly beaten by Victoria’s combined team in
Melbourne. The premier clubs of the two cities meet
after the season closes. Last year Carlton (V.) went
down before Norwood (S.A.). This time West Adelaide
just knocked out Norwood in the local final, while Carlton
was again on top in Melbourne. Carlton again made the
journey to Adelaide (with two good men absent), and
was quite comfortably beaten. “ West ” has never, until
this season, been able to beat anything above a team
from the Home for Incurables, and its success is con-
sidered a triumph for the training principles of Jack
Reedman, the veteran cricketer.

Australian footballers in the Cold Country are
having a parlous time. The Wallabies, as the amateurs
call themselves, have lost Flanagan and Peter Burge
with broken understandings, and C. E. Murnin through
illness. The League team is minus Hennessey, who frac-
tured his jaw, or got it smashed, at Bradford, last week.
A. B. Burge and Ken Gavin have departed to reinforce
the Wallaby team, and should arrive in England about
Nov. 16, which will be in time to take part in the big
matches of the tour. British football is evidently still in
a bad way, as both amateur and professional teams have
so far won more than a fair proportion of the matches
played. The Leaguers were earning an undesirable repu-
tation for rough play, by the way.
* * * *
First-grade cricket in Sydney on Saturday was
a curious display of excellent form by comparatively
young batsmen, and shocking failures by big guns.
Folkard, of Balmain, made 149 ; Bubb, of Glebe, 134 ; and
Bull, of Middle Harbor, 131. On the other hand, Cotter
left for two, Noble was bowled for five, Trumper excelled
himself with 29, and the Rev. Waddy went for four.
The big guns failed in the bowling as well.
Cotter’s first 24 yielded 46, which was better than fish-
ing ; and while Noble took none for 28, his humble club-
mate, Sayle, smashed up three for eight runs, and Collins
got five for 20.
**■*•*
Rain during the week considerably affected
Melbourne wickets last Saturday, so the different debates
for the pennant were mostly distinguished by deadly
trundling and frequent blobs. The best score was Delves’
67 for Carlton, while the only ones which can be considered
respectable were Stuckey’s67 for North, and Healey’s 56for
Richmond. Melbourne, which had finished on the previous
Saturday with six for 256, had, considering the wicket,
an easy chance of a first innings victory. So they declared
their innings closed, sent in their opponents, South, and
walloped them all down for 97, Hazlitt taking seven for
31. South had another try, but the crushing only yielded
33 for five wickets —which result was due to Armstrong,
who, on the drying wicket, obtained four for 17. Mel-
bourne thus won easily' by 159 on the first innings. East v.
University' finished similarly. East (eight for 241) declared
theirinnings closed, rocked down the students for 108 and
four for 38 (Collins, 7 for 52). East thus had a balance of 133.
The argument between Carlton and Essendon, which
began evenly, resulted in an easy win for the first-named
b.y nine wickets. With a lead of 16 on the first innings,
the ’Donspatted up 84 very politely, leaving Carlton 101 to
win, arid Carlton did it with the loss of only one wicket.
P’ran, taking advantage of the damp turf, declared their
four for 215 finished, and murdered R’mond for 27 (Kyle
four for 60, and Blackie three for one). So P’ran won by
188, though R’mond managed to make 110 for six wickets
on their second appearance. Northcote were very' easily
beaten by North, with the margin of four wickets’and 85
runs, North having responded to N’cote’s 100 with six for
185. As for St. Kilda, they finished their small trouble with
Collingwood, with a win by 61 on the first innings,
scores being—Saints, 163; and C’wood, 102, and six
for 111.

Those Sub-District matches which began in
Melbourne on Saturday were worse than unfavorable—
they were just devastations ! Port v. Williamstown was
practically notable for its array of ey'eglasses, 11 of them
being exhibited for the afternoon. Ports made 50, ’Town
41; then Ports lost three for one. Townsman Crowe (4 for
9), and Portsmen Purvis (4 for 5) and McDougall (6 for 16)
were the most valuable hurlers of the ball. Hawthorn v.
Malvern was equally tame from a batting point of view.
Malvern obtained 42 and three for four, to which the
“naice ” suburb has answered with 64. Haw-hawthorn
bowler Macrow secured best bowling honors with eight
for 10, while Malvernite Ballantvne gathered in six for 44.
The matches Brighton v. Caulfield and Coburg v. Elstern-
wick had to be postponed, as the Caulfield and Coburg
grounds were, for a good part, plain ocean.

Sydney Flying Squadron also opened its season
with tvyo heats and a final, in which some very pretty
work was displayed. In the first heat Chris Webb, in the
Australian, downed both Vision and Donnelly, and in the
second T. Leach, in Zanita, won easily. In the final,
with the same handicaps, they both beat Australian, and
in the struggle for places Vision downed Donnelly by'2secs.
Vision would have won the double event but for
a sudden squall, which caught it under a full spinnaker
and laid the boat over, gunwale under, while the audience
held its breath and waited for the capsize. But if skipper
Duncan had been caught napping, he redeemed his repu-
tation, and brought the boat upright, but full to the
thwarts. Meanwhile, the balers worked feverishly', and
soon had the water out. Then Vision flew on, but it was
too late ; the wary Christian Webb had soared to the
front on that sudden gust, and the race was over.
* * * ( *
Webb now appears to have quite recovered
from the recent indisposition, and to be building himself
up in great style. He will need to, as Arnst has only 81b.
to get off to reach his cargo limit, and is also hard at
work. During the last few weeks of his preparation
Arnst will camp up the Wanganui River, and practically
live and sleep in the open air. When last heard from he
weighed 13st. 81b., and was generally growing in favor as
the coming champion, in spite of his tendency to roll,
and a shrug of the shoulders that is said to interfere in
some way with the clean delivery of his stroke. All the
same, he will have to look after himself, for Webb, in spite
of his illness, is a formidable rower, and a man who com-
bines sprinting ability with the power to last. And that
is always a dangerous combination.
George Whelch, although only 29 years of age,
has a fine record, having won 46 of 56 races competed in.
For a champion athlete he is small, his height being only
sft. 6in. and his rowing weight 9st. 101 b. But he has
mopped up the best Maoriland has brought against him,
including Webb, whom he downed in 1905 at Wellington.
In ’O6 and ’OB he won the single championship of the
State, and also (both times in company with J. Woodill)
secured the double sculls championship. If he downs
Thoroughgood, who is a giant compared to him, he will
come at the winner of the Webb-Arnst match.

Almost a “ Henley ” crowd spread itself along
the upper banks of the Yarra on Saturday to watch a race
that lasted just a second short of five minutes. On the
previous Friday a Scotch College eight had won its heat
against Geelong Grammar School, Geelong College had
beaten Wesley, and the C. of E. Grammar School had
beaten Xavier College, but was “ outed ” for a foul: where-
fore the “final,” to decide which was to be “head of the
river” for the year, raised hopes of a good race. The
winning post has been shifted higher up, opposite the
Morgue, so as to avoid the bend, and the almost straight
mile clearly demonstrated the superiority of “Scotch,”
who, on an average weight of list. 131 b., rowed a long,
machine-like stroke that landed them home an easy two
lengths ahead of Geelong College, and eight lengths
ahead of Xavier. The Geelong lads scaled an average
list. o£lb., and as iit was that school’s first appearance in
this race they have nothing to be ashamed of.
While? this episode was perspiring on the upper
river, the single sculls Amateur Championship of the
State was being decided on the 2J miles stretch between
Williamstown and Footscray, where for the last seven
years P. C. Ivens has led all competitors home. P. C. has
given it best now, and Brasch, of the Mercantile,
was expected to row away from his only oppo-
nent, A. Richards, of South Melbourne. Starting
with 36 strokes to Richards’ 34, he did so at first,
and at the ’Scray Bottle Works was two lengths to the
good, but there Richards spurted and Brasch shut up
like a clam. At the Lyell Works the South Melbournite
had his boat’s nose in front, and thence to the finish he
increased his advantage, winning eventually by nearly
100 yards. Time (17min.) is 21sec. worse than Ivens’
best, but there was an ebb tide, and a strong freshet in
the river to contend against, which makes Richards’ per-
formance look promising.

How Maoriland has suddenly come to the front
in rowing! Here are Arnst and Webb, both Maori-
landers, about to contest the world’s championship on
the Wanganui; and Whelch, of Akaroa, is going to try
and wrest the Australian championship from Benjamin
Thoroughgood, at the Hunter River. If half that is said
about Whelch is true, he is a wonder. His endurance is
described as phenomenal and his speed as marvellous,
and he is said to be able to row a whole three-mile course
from start to finish at top speed. Evidently the grave is
being dug for Arnst’s championship before he has won it.

Newington College (N.S.W.) is the champion
school at rifle shooting, having last week won the Rawson
Cup for the sixth year in succession, and also maintained
its hold on the Great Public Schools Shield. The King’s
School was runner-up in both struggles, and in compari-
son to these two, the rest were nowhere. The dropping
of the bat and ball for the rifle is an excellent idea, and
deserves well.

The handicapping in the Warrnambool to Mel-
bourne cycle race indicates that the gentleman who fixed
the starts had a very high opinion of the powers of the
scratch men. To have won, any of them would have had
to cover the whole distance at an average rate of 23i
miles an hour, which is a tall order for 165 miles. Not
since Jack Arnst struck a weak field in 1903 has a scratch
man won, and, if the long markers are to be given such
handicaps in future, there is little chance of the scratch
men ever doing it again. For the long markers train
for the big race now as they did not in the days a-rear.
The system of long handicaps grew up in days when the
front-markers were novices and the scratch men were
riders with reputations. Now the whole bunch trains,
and trains hard, and the handicapper needs must make a
fresh start without any previous data to work on.

“ I’m glad, when at last, after three years’
trying, I have induced Mr. Johnson to meet me in the
ring, that it is to be right here in Australia ; for there
are no such sports in the world as Australians, and there’s
no place on earth where two men could get such a sure
fair and square deal. Why, when I whipped your cham-
pion the other day, you’d ha’ thought from the way they
cheered me that it was the other way around.” —Tommy
Burns at the Hanging Up of the Purse of £7500 on
Thursday.
* * ■* *
On Thursday last, Hugh D. Mclntosh deposited
with sporting scribe W. F. Corbett, cheques for £7lOO, the
stake in the Burns-Johnson disturbance, which will take
place in Sydney on the morning of Boxing Day. E. W.
O’Sullivan was in the chair, and many sporting scribes
looked on with watering mouths and wondered why their
misguided parents hadn’t brought them up to be world-
famous bruisers. Evidently the champion of the world
has no misgivings about the result of the struggle, as he
deposited with Mr. Corbett a cheque for £lOOO that John-
son would not stop him in 20 rounds, let alone 12, as the
browp man boasted he would, and another fqr a like
amount that he would win right out. So when Johnson
arrives he has something pretty to cover and battle for.
It was a cheerful function. The speakers were in good
form, the refreshments were excellent, and the informa-
tion vouchsafed was interesting.
Scientific Boxing and Self Defence, Ltd., it
seems, is four-fifths Mclntosh —the sterling sportsman who
made the League of Wheelmen run straight in spite of the
capers of the cronk riders, and who threw away the
Sydney Thousand because he could not guarantee a
straight run. So, considering that the Mclntosh is the
governing director of the syndicate, the public can rest
assured that the coming trouble will be a genuine battle.
Tommy Burns announced that the scrap is his last, and
when he has polished off Johnson, or yielded up to him
the championship, he retires in deference to the wish of
his wife. It is also more than possible that he will settle
in Australia, and, perhaps, spend his leisure in send-
ing forth over the earth a stream of Australian cham-
pions. This last was not announced, but writer hears it
on what may be considered reasonable authority. But,
all the same, Burns does not strike one as the sort of man
who will fool round turning out fighters. He is above it.
He is an anachronism in pugilism, a man who regards the
whole business with sovereign contempt. He found him-
self quite inadvertently a professional boxer, havingnlled
a gap on impulse one night. He also discovered at the
same time that he had splendid physical qualifications for
a professional boxer, and saw how', with bis physique, he
could make money quicker at it than any other w’alk of
life, and w'aded in to do so. And he has done it. And of
all his fights this one with Johnson is probably the only
one he will enter with any personal feeling. Johnson has
“pursued” him—mostly with talk—and in the riot some
things have been said that have irritated Burns, and the
result will be a fight that will be worth going far to see.
It will be interesting in more wavs than one.
In the first place, Burns’ reputation is at stake. The
other side has sneered at his reputation as a paper one,
made by sweeping through a crowd of mediocre fighters
and missing the giants. For it is the fashion just now to
regard Jeffries, Sharkey, Ruhlin, Fitzsimmons, and the
batch of fighters who were on in the last act, so to speak,
as something far superior to anything on deck just now.
But it isn’t Burns’ fault that he and they did not
come on in the same act. Had they been on deck there
is little doubt that the burly man with the Napoleonic
face and the slow drawl wouid have fought them every
one, and, considering the anatomical subtleness of his
fighting methods, would also have held his own. And
that is just where the real interest of the fight with John-
son crops up. It is the meeting of the old and the new.
Johnson, judging by his exhibitions in Australia, belongs
to the old school that swings mighty, bone-smashing
blows ; while Burns represents the new, short, quick jab
on the vital spot, repeated over and over again, till the
other man crumples up. The blow that Bang caught.
Burns would have laid out the old style of fighter who
stood up square and strong, whereas when it struck
Burns it lost its effect because it was like hitting
a swinging door, and he went with the blow.
Moreover, Burns’ methods of defence are unique.
Whereas the “ giant ” took the punishment on his glove,
or dodged it, Burns paralyses the attack by delivering
short, quick taps on the fighting shoulder or arm, which
divert the blow, destroy its force, and produce a feeling
of helplessness which is fairly close to demoralisation.
* * * *
With a view to rounding off his world cham-
pionship scrap in a neat and workmanlike manner, the
Mclntosh cabled for James Jeffries to come as referee
with: “How much?” James replied : “ Bowest possible,
£lOOO and all exes.” Mac wired : “Be blowed ! ”

Arthur Douglas, a leathery S’ African, met
Hughie Mehegan at Melbourne Oyclorama, Mother
night. Douglas had a powerful reputation as a smiter,
and went to work in a vigorous way. Mehegan is among
the top flighters, and is a difficult proposition to ex-
tinguish early in the game owing to an effective smother.
In fact, his smother spoils his work from a spectacular
point of view. But smothering tactics went for nought,
because the man with the leather dial sailed in at close
quarters A la Burns, and in consequence Mehegan was
soon up the pole. Though th > contest lasted 11 rounds,
Mehegan never had his nose in front at any stage. In the
fourth round the S’African dropped Mehegan with a short
right that landed too high to settle the argument, and in
the ninth spasm Mehegan sank to the floor like sft. bin.
of tripe. At the conclusion of the 11th scene Mehegan’s
best friend skied the chiffon, and Douglas left with the
heavy end of the cash-box.

Maoriland Rugby TTnion has started a revolu-
tion, and when Maoriland Rugby sees itself after being
remodelled, it will wonder what the apparition is. The
rules are to be thrown into the fire and re-cast, and our
old friend the wing-forward will practically cease from
wrangling and rushing, as he is to be penned back behind
an imaginary line drawn through the back.of the scrum
while the ball is therein. There will be much controversy
about the locality of that line in the future. The frequent
cause of much nose-wrecking will be done away with by
the referee putting the leather into the scrum with his
own fair hands. The line-out scramble goes overboard,
but crawls on deck again in a reduced state, as the ball
must be thrown in a full distance of not less than five
yards. Further, the game is to be divided into four spells
of 20mins. each, With an interval after the second spell.
Altogether the reformers have stolen quite a number of
points from the despised Australian game.

Stories of the iniquities that killed bike racing
in Melbourne are as plentiful as pebbles now that the
game is up. The plans of the boss schemer were fallible,
of course, but as far as he could ensure the “ stiffness ” of
starters, other than the one that carried his bullion, he
stopped at nothing in his meth.ods of making them “safe.”
His selected candidate for a certain big Wheel Race (not
so many years ago) was found to be a very doubtful
“good thing” on his merits. As a matter of fact the
chosen one got beaten pretty badly in the race by men
who either couldn’t help it or who had been contemptu-
ously ignored in the deadening arrangement. But pre-
vious to the event the deadener had feared one above all
others of the lot left in for the final, and this one was so
confident about his chance that he at first refused to be
bought. His own particular boss was content to partici-
pate in the swindle, but he—the rider—expressed a de-
termination to win if possible. So the deadener came
along with an increased offer, which was refused. Finally,
he gave the.rebellious subject the option of being wholly
bribed or half murdered. His threat was undisguised.
He would stand no nonsense, he said. Intimidation
carried the point, and the rebellious subject agreed to be
one of the preordained losers.


ACUTE HEARING
Deafness and Head Noises.
The instances in which the unfortunate people affected
with Deafness and Noises regain their natural hearing
(says the Health Journal) are so rare as to arouse
unusual comment. Such, however, appears to have been
the case regarding the miraculous restoration of perfect
hearing to a woman named Mrs. Jennie Stuart, who
resides at 62 Bondi Road, Waverley, N.S.W.
Mrs. Stuart (who is a professional nurse) first noticed
something wrong with her hearing while attending a
patient in her professional capacity, whom she had to ask
to repeat her conversation on several occasions, and
presumed that it may have been the fault of her patient
not speaking sufficiently distinct. Mrs. Stuart, however,
suspected that there was something wrong with her
hearing when in church one Sunday morning, she could
hardly hear the sermon. Being a nurse, and understand-
ing the great complexity of the Aural construction and
the many ills this delicate organism is subject to, she
naturally realised the importance of immediate attention,
and at once consulted a doctor, who made a thorough
and careful examination, after which he prescribed the
usual treatment, but, surprisingly, the following Sunday,
Mrs. Stuart could hear no better, and, if anything, she
felt worse. She then consulted an Ear Specialist, but
with no improvement, so she bothered no more with
doctors for a while, in the vain hope that the trouble might
disappear and her hearing would improve in its natural
course. But, instead of improving, it was only getting
worse and worse. She later consulted another specialist,
and then another, but without any benefit whatsoever, and
her deafness was growing worse from time to time, until
one day (about 15 years ago) she noticed a peculiar roar-
ing sound in the head and a sort of ringing in the ears.
These noises started again a few days later, and repeated
the following day, so that it became quite annoying. The
disagreeable noises seemed to increase from time to time
until they appeared to be permanent, and caused the
deafness to advance to a much more severe stage.
Nurse Stuart then consulted other reputable specialists
and some of the leading medical practitioners known
in the profession. All these able men took advantage
of every recognised medical treatment in this case, for, in
addition to the financial consideration, their professional
reputation was at stake, and they took a personal interest
in the woman. Her case received special attention, but
all the efforts made by these well-known medical men
seemed to have been in vain, for the poor woman was con-
tinually getting worse. She then tried some of the
advertised devices for curing Deafness and Head Noises,
but without any benefit, until, fortunately, one day she
was told of the Earoscope, which applied Pure Aural
Kinetics to the Ear.
Nurse Stuart, having tried everything, with the result
that she was only growing worse from day to day, natu-
rally lost all hope of ever being cured, and only tried
the Earoscope as the very last resource. But what a
happy surprise it was for her to notice symptoms of
improvement after a few days’ application of the Aural
Kinetics. t
Nurse Stuart was gradually regaining her hearing in
such a manner that when she attended church ten days
later she was quite able to hear the clergyman speak
when sitting close by. The Ear Noises seemed to diminish
from day to day, and the good nights’ rest which Mrs.
Stuart was then able to enjoy seemed to constantly in-
crease her hearing, and in four weeks’ time she was so
improved that she could hear the clergyman quite plainly
from the very back seat in the church. The doctors
were quite surprised at the wonderful cure so success-
fully attained in this case, after they had given up all
hope of the woman ever regaining' her hearing, and even
the specialists had proclaimed her case entirely incurable
prior to this treatment.
Since then it has been proved that the Aural Kinetics
applied by the Earoscope has cured innumerable cases of
Deafness, Head Noises, Ringing in the Ears, and various
Aural complications. The Earoscope seems to be entirely
diffeheiit from all other treatments, inasmuch as it con-
tains no Drugs, no Chemicals, and no Electricity, but
simply Pure Aural Kinetics, which all sufferers can apply
themselves right at their own homes quite conveniently,
and perfectly safe, without the necessity of a doctor, and
without any interference to daily routine work, business,
or social duties.
Anyone suffering from Deafness, Head Noises, Ringing
in the Ears, or any other Aural complication, as well as
those interested in this subject, may write for further
particulars to the Earoscope Institute, which will be sent
by them free of any charge on mentioning this paper.

HERE are num-
bers of people in
Melbourne and
in other parts
of Australia
who haven’t
seen Sydney,
and have only heard of it as a place
that is not too shy about its harbor.
That able-bodied fetich, certainly due at its
birth to the modest declarations of the proud
Sydneyite, has been growing and flourishing some-
what like the river hyacinth ever since. It is by now
a fairly vigorous idea, implying that there is very
little to see in Sydney but the harbor. That is a
mistake, as anybody who takes one of the steamers
of the Five Companies to Sydney, will see. After
the traveller has entered Sydney Heads, he cer-
tainly views probably the most picturesque sheet
of water in the world ; but, behind that is Sydney;
and behind Sydney are the Blue Mountains. All
of those things have come to be included in the visit
—for anybody who goes to Sydney without visit-
ing the Blue Mountains would be considered as un-
conventional and eccentric as the person who
would inspect the harbor without looking at Syd-
ney. To-day a trip to Sydney means rather a
trip to New South Wales.
When the steamer gets abreast of the Mac-
quarie light, which pokes up into the sky on the
South Head, the traveller begins to understand
why so much language has been poured upon the
scene that is spread before his gaze. As the
steadier gets fairly into the middle of it, he then
sees the full beauty of the scene. On his left are
those delightful indentations known as Watson’s,
Rose, Double and Rushcutters Bays, with their
green slopes and prettily situated villa resi-
dences. Ahead is Middle Head, slowly
lifting itself into full view, and, to the right
of it, Middle Harbor receding into the dis-
tance. All around are blue-watered bays,
and, with a generous sun splashing
the scene, the whole is a million
pictures in one. Then Sydney
emerges into sight; ferry-
boats buzz across the water
with more frequency and
numerousness ; big, fat mail-
boats with aldermanic waist-
bands, so to speak, crush
into the perspective at Circu-
lar Quay ; the steamer slowly
rounds Miller’s Point and brings up at itsappointed
place in Darling Harbor. Then the traveller
tumbles ashore with his baggage, and soon dis-
covers that bydney isn’t all harbor. An efficient
and speedy electric tramway system, which
wanders all over the city and suburbs,
is there, ready to take up and set down at
almost any address. The cars run all night
and all day—which allows the visitor to face the
prospect of getting home late, or rather early,
with equanimity. Moreover, they are as safe as
every public vehicle, excepting, perhaps, hearses !
£52?
When the stranger commences to look around
Sydney it won’t be long before he happens upon
the Botanical Gardens, which overlook Farm
Cove. These Gardens, which, along with the
Domain, comprise a pretty extensive area, are
noted for their pleasant situation and the care
given to their numerous flower beds, lawns, and
drives. Lying on the green slope above Farm
Gove one can gaze down upon as peaceably pretty
a scene as has ever been met with in an
album of British views. The Australian squad-
ron of British warships may sometimes be seen
lying at anchor—which rather aids the effect than
otherwise—while, farther out, the ever-busy ferry
boats—fussing about like the hostesses at a bishop’s
garden party—may be decried, like kids’ toys on
a toy sea. In the Gardens, or, rather, in the
Domain, is the Art Gallery, worth more than a
moment of time and demanding more than an
atom of intelligence. The pictures are instructive
and good, their general quality leaning to sanity
rather than to pyrotechnics; while the Minera-
logical and Agricultural Museum attached will
move the expert to sobs of admiration. Running
along one side of the Domain is Macquarie-street,
a most portentous and awesome thoroughfare.
There, clustering in a bunch of right roval edifices,
are the Houses of Parliament, the Lands Office,
Treasury, etc. —all of which the visitor cannot
omit to scan,, since they are the centre —the
official brain centre—of a State that has had its
name in the papers. But time doesn’t permit an
intimate inspection, unless the stranger has two
eternities’ leave of absence—which he hasn’t —so
he shoves his way on to a tramcar and leaves the
scene aft. When he has to seethe G.P.0., the
Town Hall, St. Mary’s R.C. Cathedral, the Queen
Victoria Markets, the Central Railway Station,
the theatres, the University—not to mention
numbers of others that would burst any ordinary
catalogue—he hasn’t time to gather matter for
architectural treatises.
What with Sydney trams and Sydney ferries,
the visitor will get quite a lot to engage his atten-
tion in record time. By the trams he can go to
Botany, La Perouse, Glebe, Leichhardt, etc., in
rather swift time ; while the ferries, which ply all
over the harbor from Watson’s Bay and Manly on
one side to the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers
on the other, open up, so to speak, the best bits of
harbor Scenery. Now that the summer is on the
threshold, the harbor will commence to look its
choicest, and the attractions of its many indenta-
tions be increased tremendously. Also, the season
for surf-bathing at Manly, Coogee and Bondi has
already broken out. and troops of people are com-
mencing to be joyful and shouting multitudes,
spending a loti 0 f their leisure in washing in the
sort of monastic garments determined by the local
councils.
Everybody who goes to Sydney goes to the
Blue Mountains—it is inevitable ! Everybody
takes train to Eatoomba, the most central spot
from which excursions are made. From Ka.toomba,
one goes downhill. The sights are spread out
lower down ifi splodges of grandeur' upon the
map. There ,are the Leura Falls, beautiful,
titanic, and of startling depth. The tableland
thereabouts has been cleft into chasms, and has all
the awesomeness of big, unfamiliar things. The
vegetation in the vicinity is as luxuriant, but less
garish, than a milliner’s showroom. It runs to wild
loveliness and extraordinary abundance, and the
memory of it is lifelong! Other places that demand
bare eyes or field'glasses are the Kanimbla Valley,
Minnihaha Falls, Govett’s Leap—a grim, shivery
thing, with a 520 ft. drop—and the notable Jeno-
lan Caves. Mugh iias been written about the
Caves —but not; too much ! To pour the diction-
ary on them is only to advertise them. They have
had thousands of visitors, and will have thousands ’
more. They have the beauty of all natural won- i
ders ; while the six-hours’ journey to them from
Mount Victoria is an interesting festival of the
unexpected. Weeks rather
than days should be spent ir
the Blue Mountains;
while some attention
could be given to the
Hawkesbury and the
attractions of the
Southern Tableland.
And all of those
things can be seen
and memorised by
first embarking on
one of thesteamers of
the Five Companies.


S. A. law-coui’fcs discover that existing legis-
lation makes a fool of them. The police-magis-
trate in Adelaide dismissed a gambling case. He
was overruled on appeal, but it seems that in such a
position there is no machinery whatever for collect-
ing the fine and Costs! The P.M. says that if he put
the bailiffs in, in the ordinary way, he would be
liable to an action for damages. As things now
stand, an appeal against a police-court conviction
has a sporting chance of success, whilst an appeal
against an acquittal is no good even if it does suc-
ceed. So the fool of an Act is to be altered.
Queensland Government has two railway
lines in progress—at least they are more or less in
progress—in the rich Atherton-Herberton table-
land (N.Q.): one the Tolga branch; the other
from Atherton to the Evelyn scrub. There has
been a good deal of growling about the conditions
under which the work is let, mostly in small
contracts, and feeling is being worked up against
Railway Minister Kerr. Both lines will open up
very rich land ; but at present thereabouts one
sees 30 Chinese at cultivation work for one
white Australian. Simultaneously with the
building of the lines, something drastic ought to
be done to prevent the leading of lands to Ah Sin.
It can’t be the climate in this case, for if the
white men can’t work on this tableland they can’t
work at Ballarat.
The Parliament that Adolphus Bent nomi-
nally bosses began its present session on July 2
15 weeks ago and so far the measures assented to
comprise two Supply Bills, a Bill to allow muni-
cipalities to spend their rates on Fleet celebra-
tions, three semi-private Bills (South Melbourne
Mechanics, Castlemaine land and Elsternwick
Land), the Ultima Railway Construction, and the
Mines Development (i.e. y mining cos.’ subsidis-
ing) Bills. Eight measures altogether—and not
one of even second-rate importance ! The hapless
State keeps two Houses of 100 members, and a
sub-Governor at £5OOO a year, together with all
the costly paraphernalia said to be necessary, in
order to pass eight trifling measures in 15 weeks—
work that a small, compact council could do in
half as many days at one-tenth the cost.
Labor member Page was one of the bright
spots (and James of Maranoa makes a large spot)
m the iron bonus debate. Various Labor mem-
bers whined that the Commonwealth couldn’t
afford a bonus. Fowler wanted to know how the
spending of it was going to benefit Westralia.
All this made Page as angry as he can be :
Why, when I listen to this sort of whining, it sounds to
me as if it ought to come from the Conservative Opposi-
tion, and not from my colleagues in the Labor corner.
Is this Commonwealth gone so low financially that it
cannot spend £20,000 to help an industry in which
thousands of men draw wages? lam not going- to lend
my vote to take the bread and butter out of those men’s
mouths.
"'Lm ” Page is an alleged Freetrader, and, as
a Freetrader, is presumably prepared to prevent
quite a lot of bread and butter going into Aus-
tralia’s mouth.
Now that the warm weather is coming on, the
problem for many people will be how to keep cool. Some
get into t.he sea at 6 o’clock in the morning, and* have a
good swim, believing, and rightly, that to thoroughly
cool the body first thing in the morning is an excellent
tonic against summer-heat. Other folks again reach the
desideratum by carefully regulating their diet, abstain-
ing from heating foods, and avoiding blood-heatino-
highly alcoholic liquors. But superior to all these is the
man who not only takes his morning dip, and carefully
watches his diet, hut who also adds true zest to life, gets
into a hammock or an easy chair on the shady sirie of the
house, fills his G.B.D. pipe with his favorite tobacco, and
enjoys through this famous pipe the sweetest, coolest
smoke possible to obtain.*

in the battle of life. Life’s battle is a bard one, and you must have steady nerve, a clear brain, and muscles like
bands of steel. The weak man or woman must give way to the strong, the robust and the vigorous. Your health and
physical vitality should be guarded as the miser guards his gold. Dr. McLaughlin, the electrical authority, has discov-
ered the true method of applying Electricity for the perfect cure of the ills and ailments
of mankind. Electricity is Nature’s Remedy. There is not a weak person in
this whole world to-day who cannot become strong, healthy and vigorous again if they
will only apply the right current of Electricity. We have a method of applying Electricity
for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.
ORUCS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach

The Lost Australian Oil Industry.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An oil industry is like a sugar or dairy
industry, consisting of a big refinery surrounded
bv a number of crude oil works. Even the 19
Standard Oil Companies of the United States do
not depend on their own wells. They buy petro-
leum from thousands of wells, and make
their money out of the refining and selling of
it. The refineries of Scotland also buy oil from
crude oil companies, who make a good thing out
of the raw material.
It takes costly machinery, skilled chemists and
expensive craftsmen to make oil shale into the
adjuncts of civilisation. And hitherto Australian
shale has been worked with too small a capital.
Owing to the inaccessible nature of the country
the pioneers could not even maintain regular sup-
plies of shale for export for foreign gas makers.
And the erratic nature of the supply did much to
kill the trade. Then the foreign gas-maker cast
round for a substitute and found, among other
things, the incandescent burner, which made in-
ferior gas give a fairly bright light.
Unfortunately, the shale-bearing country of
N.S.W. is in very rough, inaccessible terri-
tory, and that is one of the things that
has practically prevented Australia having a
booming oil industry to-day. Even so rabid a
Freetrader as Henry Parkes encouraged the in-
dustry by a duty of 3d. per gallon. And it
was owing to that duty that sundry enter-
prising people tried to start a shale oil industry.
This difficulty of access has been the great lion
in the path. The late David Syme was a man of
giant resources and mighty energy and grit. He
knew all about the shale deposits of N.S.W., and
determined to blossom into an Oil king. He came,
he saw, and he skedaddled. He saw that till rail-
ways were built through the shale-bearing coun-
try it was useless to construct any great central
refinery. For, like sugar and butter, successful
oil-making depends upon concentration and the
creation of great refineries.
* * * *
Hitherto, the habit of the Freetrader and the
Standard Oil advocate has been, when an Australian
duty on oil has been proposed, to shriek, “Look
at the Scottish industry. If the Scottish industry
can thrive without Protection, the richer shale of
Australia can fight the battle of life without Pro-
tection.” But as the Freetrader is generally a fool,
it is quite safe to look at Scotland. The Scottish
shale oils are prodigiously rich in ammonia liquid
and paraffin wax, yielding as much as 20 and 25
per cent, of - the latter to the Australian
shale oil’s sto 6| per cent. So rich were
the Scottish shales in this respect that
they were able to treat the ammonia and wax as
primary products, and the oil itself as a secondary.
But more : the Scottish shale industry was the
first in the English-speaking countries. It started
away back in 1842, and for many years vast quan-
tities of Scottish shale oils were exported to the
United States, where illuminating oils were
made from them. It was .not till 1858 that the
Yankee oil industry started, and it was not till
1868 that John D. Rockefeller appeared on the
scene. In 1882 he floated his business into a
company, with a capital of $70,000,000; and
about the end of the ’eighties he at-
tacked the Scottish Shale Oil industry,-
and by sustained dumping endeavored to
slay it. So all those years, from ’42 to ’9O, the
Scottish shale industry had no rival in its home
market, and all those years the men who ran it
were perfecting machinery, getting better know-
ledge of their shale and its potentialities, and
securing their market. The Australian industry
has no such halcyon period in front of it. It has
to evolve its industry, to do much pioneering
chemical work, and scrap several plants in conse-
quence ; and then, having done all these things
and built a few railways to make its deposits acces-
sible and generally get the industry ready to
start, it has to come out and tear its market from
the very teeth of the Standard Oil Trust.
Can Australians reasonably expect that anyone
will put up the hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, necessary to do all this, unless Australia
shows some sign of being interested in the develop-
ment of its own resources,* and evinces some in-
clination to encourage such enterprise by securing
the industry at, least a share of its own market ?
It is as much the duty of the Australian people to
protect its capitalists from unfair competition as
it is to protect them from the attacks of train
wreckers and burglars. And if Australians expect
people to do so much for Australia without
encouragement, they expect too much. For
although the Scottish industry had 48 years’ start
when the Standard Oil Trust came along with its
Sherman methods, in the end the number of re-
fineries greatly diminished.
• * * •
Australia, with its practically unlimited
supplies of oil shale, has the makings of a
gigantic industry. But to organise such an
enterprise means money, money and more money;
and without security no one can get money.
When the Australian Oil Industry has been
builded up and makes its first effort in
the export line, it the launching of
tank . steamers, the construction of reservoirs
at various ports of shipment, and, as much oil
would be sent abroad tinned and cased, an army
of workmen would be employed in making the
tins and cases, and the supply of raw material
would increase and foster the tin and spelter
works, saw mills and other subsidiary indus-
tries. Australia would get its oil as cheap if
not cheaper than it does now, and instead of sup-
porting several towns out west in the U.S.A., the
oil trade of the world would support several
thriving towns scattered around the Blue Moun-
tains, and throughout Queensland and Tasmania.
This may seem a visionary view to take of
things. But it is ' not. The destruction of the
Australian oil industry is regarded as important
by the American oil kings not so much for “ the
present Australian trade, but for the possibilities
that lie ahead if that industry is developed.” Aus-
tralia has such vast potentialities in that respect
that at any cost the industry must be kept from
starting, and the most accomplished lobbyist in
the service of the Standard Oil Company of New
York was sent all the way to Australia to plead
the company’s case wdth our legislators. The
result was that the provision that only kerosene
which came into Australia in bulk should be free
was dropped, and a motion to place oil on the
free list was carried on the voices. The Standard
Oil Co. of New York is the parent company of the
19 Standard Oil Companies, and its directors are
the directors of the whole bunch, and control their
poHcy. , *
Now the question arises how is this splendid
oil industry to be fostered. As the tariff is dis-
posed of the question of imposing a duty cannot
easily be raised at present. The admission of
kerosene free of duty makes it possible for the
local industry to be fought by means of dump-
ing, and if not ruined outright, to be ren-
dered so non-lucrative as to disgust the
people who have put money into it. The first
really large-scale attempt to start the indus-
try is about ready to begin operations. It
has constructed a railway right into the shale-bear-
ing country; and is putting down a refining plant
that will compare favorably with any in the world.
Altogether, over half a million of capital has
been expended in getting the ground cleared
for the starting of a great oil industry.
Therefore the best way to encourage the industry
is to grant a bounty on the production’of crude
oil. And a bounty of 2d. per gallon will
place the Australian oilmen where the compe-
tition of the United States, British East
Indian and other oils will not be able to
crush them, without giving them the opportunity
of creating anything like a monopoly. To give a
bounty on the refined oil would make the bounty
a benefit for big capitalists only. Given on the

crude oil, it will work for the ideal oil industry, in
which there may be a hundred or a thousand small
men working shale or crude oil plants and selling
their product to the big refinery to be further
manufactured. The crude plants will get the
benefit of the black oil and the ammonia liquid,
and the shale country, which is quite unsuitable
for pastoral or agricultural purposes, and would
otherwise be desert, will be made to support quite
a large population. Later on, when Parliament
has time to go into the tariff again, the bounty
can be made practically self-paying, by a duty of
a penny or two per gallon on imported kerosene.
This would not increase the price to the consumer
and would come absolutely out of the pocket of
the foreign exporter, for if the foreigner raised his
price he would be cutting the throat of his own
trade by encouraging the local industry still
further, and he is not likely to do that.
* * * *
Judging by some of the speeches that one occa-
sionally reads in Hansard, there are still those
among us who may inquire why the com-
munity should subsidise any industry. The
answer is obvious. Australia giving a bounty on
the production of crude oil is like a man investing
money in a paying concern. It pays out its money
and gets in return a thriving industry which will
give work to thousands of men who will pay taxes
through the Customs, 'who will become good
citizens, and form material out of which the Aus-
tralian army of the future will be raised. They
will also create much wealth which will be liable
to taxation and thereby give a direct return for
the bounty. What Australia requires is popula-
tion and more population. At the present time
almost every Australian State has men in Europe
lecturing and exhibiting limelight views of the
country in the hope of inducing people to come
out here and throw in their lot with us.
The establishment of a thriving 'oil, lubricant,
ammonia, coke and paraffin wax industry will
bring more people here in 12 months than a score
of lecturers will in half-a-dozen years. And they
will come to find a lucrative business awaiting
them at which they can start right away and make
money. Even now, in its initial stages, before
the industry has actually started, there are over
2000 men engaged directly in connection with
the shale industry in N.S.W. Under exist-
ing circumstances, they may decrease, certainly
they will not increase; but if the Australian
nation shows by its actions that it is interested in
its shale oil industry, and is determined to
foster it, the number will increase and multiply
rapidly. The operations will become more elabo-
rate.
Up to the present the most of the money
Australia has got out of its shale has been
derived from the export of shale in the crude and
quite raw state, just as the picks of the miners tore
it from the ribs of the Blue Mountains. What
the people who bought it wanted was the gas that
it yielded. And there is no reason why we should
not export the oil instead of the raw shale. If the
oil is made here, the man who hitherto made it else-
where will come to Australia and make it here, and
Australian shopkeepers, manufacturers, newspaper
proprietors, doctors, and so forth will get the
benefit of that money instead of the people in the
same lines of business in Britain and Germany.
It must also be remembered that the State
has a direct interest in the shale industry.
It gets a cash return from it for this reason —that
every ton of shale torn from the ribs of the Blue
Mountains yields the State fid. royalty. And
when the industry is in full blast and a hundred
shale mines are each employing a few score of
miners, ripping out a few million tons per annum,
the shale royalty will represent quite a respect-
able income. Above all, the chief reason why
Australia should grant a bounty to the oil industry
is because it is a good investment. If a
man came to John Smith, and showed him
that by investing £lO,OOO per annum he
could get a steady income of £20,000 per
annum, the wildest Freetrader that ever lived
would pronounce John Smith a fool if he threw
the opportunity away. And yet Australia is in
the position of John Smith. Splendid pioneering
work has been done. The nucleus of a great in-
dustry has been established. The waste places of
the Blue Mountains have been made sources of
great wealth, and all that remains is for Australia
to rise to the occasion and make up its mind that
it will have an oil industry and get into its pocket
the wealth that at present lies amidst the ravines
and gorges of the Great Dividing Range.
* * * *
India, Japan, Russia, Austria, Canada and
France, Germany, Italy, Roumania, the Nether-
lands Indies and other countries have all found it
necessary to protect their oil industries from the
attacks of the great Yankee octopus. Which ex-
plains why a recent writer in the World’s Work
remarked pathetically that, if the Standard Oil
Companies received many more rebuffs like that
experienced in India, several American towns
would go back to the wilderness.
Well, it is better that any number of American
towns should go back to the wilderness than that
the Australian wilderness should never grow a
city or two. We are here to consider Australian and
not American cities. The Standard Trust, which,
with all its faults, and notwithstanding its infamy,
is a monument of splendid organisation and
concentration, has shown the world that a
really great oil industry can be created only by
working on a large scale. The experience of
Scotland, India, British Borneo and Japan has
proved the same truism. And if Australia
desires men to invest large sums of capital
in its oil industry, it must give some encourage-
ment to capitalists to do so. It would be pre-
ferable to see an industry established by small
men, if it were possible. But it isn’t. In the
matter of shale oil we cannot do without the big
capitalist, and when he is necessary he must be
welcomed and encouraged. And in this case the
large capitalist is compelled to bring with him an
army of small men. Which quite removes any
objection which may be held to the importation
of foreign capital. The oil industry is one in
which labor represents everything, and of the
wealth made by a great shale oil industry 90 per
cent, will stay in Australia under even the most
adverse circumstances. We have to chose between
sending our kerosene shale abroad in a crude
state for the workmen of other countries to
get the benefit of manufacturing, oi: of invest-
ing a certain amount of national capital in it
to encourage capitalists to bring their work-
men here and make it, and thereby give
our country the benefit of wages spent in the
manufacture. Considering how urgently neces-
sary it is that Australia should get more Workers*
to swell the population, there can be only one
choice.
Therefore we must do as India, Japan, Russia,
Austria, and the Netherlands Indies have done :
Protect our industry. A stiff duty on imported
oil would have been the best method ; but, owing
to the Tariff having been settled, such a dutv is,
for the time being, impossible. Still, we want
the industry badly, and as, owing to circum-
stances, we cannot protect it with a duty,
it only remains to foster it with a bounty. Our
Australian legislators made a fearful blunder
when they made oil free—on the voices—for the
industry was just about to get its first chance of
real success. Although it does not follow that the
industry will close up if the bounty is not granted, it
is dead certainty that if exposed to the cUt-throat
competition to which the (Standard Oil Trust has
subjected all other competitors in the past, it Vvill
have a hard struggle to maintain itself, and cer-
tainly no chance of expanding and becoming a
world industry, bringing annually great sums of
money to Australia from the oil-burning, countries
of the world. And. there is no use having
the best and largest deposits of oil shale in
the world if we cannot turn them into wealth.
Further, to allow the industry to struggle on
under present conditions is practically to divide
the oil trade of the Commonwealth between a few
great corporations. For unless there is a bounty
to encourage people to develope the industry,
Australia will be at the mercy of the two big cor-
porations which at present face each other, viz.-
the Standard Oil Trust, which employs only dis-
tributing agents and Parliamentary lobbyists in
Australia, and the Shell Transport Co. On theother
hand the newly-created Commonwealth Oil Cor-
poration is at present employing over 2000 Aus
tralians, and has erected a plant and railway and de-
veloped shale mines at a cost of fully half a million.
A bounty, if granted on the production of orudeoil,
will bring others into competition with these
and completely break up any monopoly they
may possibly aim at. It is not probable but quite
possible that under existing circumstances these
two huge concerns might, instead of cutting one
another’s throats, combine to bleed the Australian
consumer, and make him pay through the nose for
not only his kerosene, but his sulphate of ammonia,
his paraffin wax, all his lubricating oils, his
naphtha, benzine, gasolene, vaseline, and all the
other products of the oil industry. With a bounty
on crude oil that would be impossible. A bounty
on the refined oil would not do so. Instead of
developing our own splendid deposits of oil shale
it might mean only the establishment of a few
refineries to manufacture crude oil brought in bulk
from the East Indies, and even far away
America. Paid on the production of crude oil
only, it will encourage only the manufacture of oil
made from Australian shales.
* * * *
At present, and for some time to come, New
South Wales would reap the entire benefit of such a
bounty. But in course of time the deposits of
Queensland and Tasmania would be developed
under the stimulus, and a great export trade such
as that which has brought so mtich wealth
to the United States, be built up. Of course,
there is no need for Australia to pay a bonus
on the oil exported; when the industry has
reached such proportions a bonus will be no longer
necessary, and if the oil bonus is still pay-
able, it can be recovered at the port of ship-
ment. All that is necessary for Australia is
to give such encouragement by means of a bonus
that our oil industry will have a chance to develop
its potentialities, and, when that is done, our
natural advantages are such that our oilmen can
fight the great Yankee octopus single-handed and
without State aid.
Be it therefore remembered :
That without a bonus on crude shale oil, or
duties on all shale products, Australia must
remain without an Oil Industry.
That without an Oil Industry at least 10,000
artisans must go without employment and about
two millions of Australian gold will continue to
leave Australia yearly, mostly for America, the
great bulk of it’ into" the maw of the voracious
Standard Oil Trust.
Without an Oil Industry, and with the largest
and richest shale area known on the globe, Aus-
tralia makes itself the laughing stock of the world,
except, of course, that part of it engaged in dump-
ing oils into the country. While it receives the
applause of the Standard Oil Trust, a picture of
Rockefeller, having a quiet laugh up his sleeve,
would not be out of place.
With a bonus or tariff a Shale Industry will be
established in different parts of N.S.W. by leaps
and bounds, also by gradations in Queensland
where there are known to be immense shale
deposits, Tasmania and other places. The N.S.W.
Ooke Industry has been established and is
to-day protected by 4s. a ton duty, which
is equal to 30 per cent, of the value. (The
recent contract to dump 10,000 tons of German
surplus coke into South Australia alarmed even
the Sydney Freetrade papers.) ■ And if the simple
act of turning Australian coal into coke has
already justified a duty of 30 per cent., surely the
turning of Australian shale into oil, ammonia, and
then into ammonia sulphate, into paraffin wax,
then into candles, and many other things : refining
the oil into kerosene, benzine, naphtha, motor
spirit and various other oils and greases —surely
the equal certainty of establishing this infinitely
greater industry warrants twopence a gallon bonus
on crude oil production.
In fostering the Australian Oil Industry by Pro-
tection, the Commonwealth is setting no prece-
dent, only following the example of Canada,
India, Japan, France, Germany, Russia, Spain
and other countries—all except bonnie Scotland
where, ye ken, the Oil Industry was founded
many years before oil was “struck” in the
TJnitedStates and over a quarter of a century be-
fore the Standard Oil tentacles were fully de-
veloped—hence only a few Scotch refineries
have survived England’s Freetrade and America’s
octopus —proof that Protection and eternity are
the only fair handicaps when an industry is up
against American Trust Oils.
, With our own Oil Industry, numerous new
shale mines will be at work, employing many
hundreds of miners to raise the million odd tons
of shale required for Australia’s kerosene con-
sumption alone, and the million odd other tons
wanted for other shale and oil products; some
thousands of men, women, boys and girls will find
work in the innumerable branches of the industry,
and the Factories Act and other industrial laws
will see that honest wages are paid them.
An impetus, if not a boom, will be given to
shale areas of N.S.W. if the proposed bonus on
the production of shale oil is passed, whereas, if
rejected, these Blue Mountain shale areas, which
cannot carry a rabbit to the acre, will remain the
desolate wilderness predicted for the oil towns of
the Middle West of U.S.A. if the Standard
Trust does not win its fight everywhere. The
Federal Parliament will soon be called upon
to determine between allowing these mountains,
canyons, and gorges to remain undisturbed in
their natural barrenness, the home of a restricted
number of wallabies, or turning the desolate
wastes into prosperous communities, the home of
thousands of Australian workers; building new
railways, retorting and refining plants, and other-
wise finally banishing the Standard Oil trust
from our then deservedly-named Commonwealth.
Meanwhile, let every reader of The Bulletin
keep at least one watchful eye on the votes and
voices, and be ready to put a big black inefface-
able mark against the name of every political
traitor to Australian interests and every Parlia-
mentary partisan of the Standard Oil trust, so
that mark and man will be remembered till the
Day of Judgment.

Others are being cured while
you are thinking about it.
These Rings are scientifically made from
specially-prepared metals with four zinc
and three copper coils, forming a complete
battery, which have an affinity for drawing
the uric acids to that part of the finger
that the ring is worn on, and causes it to
leave the body, and at the same time
freeing the system from Rheumatism and
other kindred ailments.

The Day Our Flag Comes Down.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The day Australia’s ensign falls—when Yellow
rags are floating
Above our Yellow Guv’nor’s halls, where Yellow
aides are gloating
Upon the goods we’ve left behind ; when we’re a
Yellow nation
With Yellow bosses set to mind the fat, well-found
sheep-station
And run Australian farms; when cheap white-
trash in bonds is striving
To earn its dole of rice, and keep its Yellow
• master thriving,
What warning will the Mongol’s crimes bring
home to us in Sorrow ?
What but the war-sign of our times? “Shem
will be here to-morrow ! ’’
That day coarse Yellow lips will tell a lovely tale
—of beauty
ihat we, dead rebels, loved so well before we died
for d u ty ;
Of snowy-limbed Australian girls that Yellow
eyes lust after—
Who shrink in horrible alarm from sounds of
beastly laughter
And Yellow hands that reach. . . . and hold. . . .
and drag their chasteness, screaming,
Down to black deeps of shame untold where foul
things lie, drug-dreaming.
In that wild, dreadful grab they’ll kind of hustle
one another—
In beauty-trade he’s far from blind, our gentle
Yellow brother !
.The day they hoist the Yellow flag where once
Australia’s floated,
The pages of each groaning Torv rag will be
devoted
To Yellow politics and news of Yellow war suc-
cesses,
And crawling, Yellow Tory views of how kind
Yellow blesses
Thfe people it appears to crush ! Our trams like
monkey-cages
Will seem, when comes that sudden rush of
Yellow in all stages ;
The pleasant tea-rooms on our Block will lose
white Lil and Lizzie,
And keep, each day at four o’clock, new Yellow
tea-girls busy.
When our good colors waken mirth on countless
Yellow faces,
Oh, we will turn beneath the earth that hides our
poor soul-cases
While, up and down, the waster few, their useless
arms discarded,
Go cursing them in language blue—in language
warm but guarded !
And take, their Yellow fear to drown, some
Yellow boozing-lotion
As slow the Yellow sun goes down behind a
Yellow ocean.
The warning’s written large and clear, a doom of
wrath and sorrow
And endless woe : “ Shem will he here, with ships
and guns , to-morrow /”
VIO,
FRANK HENTY.
This, from a correspondent at Kobe, throws some
light on a cable received in Australia on the last
day of August reporting that Japan had decided
to cut down its expenditure by £2O 000 000
looping 30 per cent, off the army and 10 per cent!
off the navy estimates:—
Events have culnuuacec) in the dissolution of the Saionji
Ministry. It had proved itself unequal to the financial
crisis which confronted it. For some months its awkward
manipulation of national finance has been the talk of the
country’s leading financiers, and, indeed, of the leading
economists of the world. The Finance Minister was
changed, but no improvement ensued. Notwithstanding
the large sums accruing* to the national exchequer from
the war fund, notwithstanding* an increase in war taxes
and Customs duties, notwithstanding* the sale of mono-
polies, the debt continued to grow, the industrial and
commercial conditions of the country were seriously
hampered, and credit abroad was greatly impaired. The
Government made an attempt to offset the despondency of
the people in not receiving the anticipated indemnity
from Kussia by launching out into enormous post helium
operations, instead of curtailing expenses and adjustin'*
financial responsibilities, already incurred ; and these
extraordinary undertakings of the Government set in
circulation an abnormal volume of borrowed money and
produced a fever of enterprise which resulted in reckless
speculation and finally in disaster. To make matters
worse, instead of paying off in ready money the big war-
loan of 100,000,000 yen recently due, the Government
instituted an unpopular system of competitive discounts
that materially disturbed banking business and threw
some institutions into liquidation. So the retirement of
the Cabinet is everywhere regarded as a relief
When the Marquis- Saionji handed in his resignation to
the Emperor, he recommended Marquis Katsura as his
successor; and the whole nation agreed that there was
but one man available, for the people had not forgotten
his consummate leadersn.p m the struggle with Russia
nor his resignation only out or sympathy with the nation
that resented the terms of peace. He is hailed now as
just the man to meet the present financial crisis, and at
the same time to be in rational sympathy with the more
moderate of the militarists. He is expected to be heartily
in favor of the new policy of curtailing naval and military
expenditure until there is an improvement of the financial
situation ; and his tolerance and tact will make for a har-
monious co-operation among the members of the Cabinet
Yet in surveying tine personnel of the Cabinet it must be
borne constantly in mind that the destinies of the
nation are ultimately in the hands of the Genro or
‘Elder Statesmen,” the guardians of the “patriotic
faith ; for the nation generally is accustomed to turn
to them m the final appeal. Considerable awkward ness
faces the present situation in view of the fact that the
Seiyu-kai, who form the majority of the present Diet are
the adherents of the retiring Government; and their
attitude to the new regime is by no means reassurin'*
hut as the tendency of the rank and file of the House is
to fall in wi th the party in power, no great inconvenience
may be anticipated by the new Cabinet.
*
The matter of an old-time shindykit with con-
cessions came up in N.S.W. Assembly the week
before last, when Morton, M.L.A., moved for a
select committee to inquire why the Illawarra Land
?i°n nnirw ° n certain d «Posit nf
£3.0,000 from the N.S.W. Government. In 1890
the shindykit was formed to construct a harbor at
Port Kernbla, build railways, and lay out coal
mines. As a guarantee that the co. wouldn’t
simply make an unseemly hash of the public
estate without doing anything useful, an Act was'
passed ordering it to deposit £lO,OOO, which was
iso- 6 f T/ e, ed r ll the . works wer e not finished by
189/. Most of them haven’t been started yet, and
fnd'L l JT 6 SUrted ar ? an 'monished nuisance
a nd n° good to anyone. After waiting until 1907
—lO years longer than the co. was entitled to—
and losing a whole precious decade, the State had
to cmnrnence h'ukhng the Port Kembla harbor
itself. Now the Corporation, which got 10 years’
Sifooo* ZTI <■•—* bXS,
£lO,OOO, but Premier Wade rightly bade the
cheeky concern try its luck in the Yaw Courts
and there will he no select committee. ’

THE OLD
AND THE NEW.
Some music never grows old, particularly
if it recalls pleasant memories. The Edison
Phonograph can reproduce for you the
marches, ballads and airs that stirred you
in the old days just as well as it can sing
the song that is the current hit of the
music halls.
Tt. gives them all with a clearness, a
fidelit} 7 and a beauty and volume of sound
that is not to be found in any similar
instrument.
The Edison Phonograph is all things to
all men at all times. Simply by changing
a record it may be a brass band at one
minute and a violin virtuoso the next ; a
singer of rag-time or of grand opera ; a
funny vaudeville team, or a quartette
singing a pretty madrigal.
Write for lists of records and machines—
then buy an Edison for the Summer time.

“ Oby ” writes :
Some little country shows that seek Government sub-
sidies want careful looking' after. Hearing of the doings
of Sydney’s Agricultural Association, numbers of one-
horse townships are stirred to hold a meeting and start
an agricultural show of their own. The cocky show
seldom does any good to agriculture. The affair is simply
a mutual cocky admiration society. An investigation
some years ago squashed several of these enterprises, but
another overhaul is wanted to-day. N.S. W. estimates of
1892 provided for a grant of £2OO for an inlahd pastoral
and agricultural society, which consisted of five persons.
They paid nothing towards the establishment or upkeep
of their society, but simply whacked up the £2oo—£4o
each.
“ Tema, ” from a back street close to Spats’
factory :
I happened across what was nearly a tragedy. An un-
offending soul in the shape of a cheap jack took his
stand in a byway near a warehouse and proceeded to talk
some. Gradually people drew round and were treated
to a free lecture on pen-nibs and tin-openers. At this
juncture out trotted a number of factory toilers for their
dinner vacation, accompanied by the inevitable football.
The space was limited, and after a while it was plain that
trouble was brewing if somebody didn’t shift; but the
tin-opener purveyor was on good money, so he risked it.
The ball started rolling with about 20 budding
Messengers behind, and the first rush ended in a field
goal kicked close over the heads of the audience. Pen-
nibs cursed, but stood his ground. The team formed a
scrum, then broke, and the next rush was disastrous.
Ginger collared the ball and went for a try. With the
balance of the team at his heels he made a vicious rush
for the nib stand, ducked between the pedlar’s legs, and
precipitated him in a heap on the footpath. The crowd
opened out and Ginger grounded the ball amid trium-
phant yells, with the rest of the team falling all over him.
On recovering from the shock, the itinerant cove arose
hurriedly, viewed his scattered wares, grabbed a tin-
opener and pounced on the malefactors. He managed
to get hold of the ball and drove the weapon clean
through the cause of the trouble. The-team got angry
and formed up to charge, but a limb of the law arrived in
time to save the situation. Ginger collected the
punctured leather, and a sad individual gathered up
sundry household articles and departed for a less strenu-
ous atmosphere.

BRONCHITIS
CURE.
The Famous Remedy for
Coughs, Bronchitis, Pneumonia,
Pleurisy, Asthma <fe Consumption
BRONCHITIS and PNEUMONIA
Cured by
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. W. G, Hearne. Dear Sir, —From a strict sense
of duty I feel that I should publish the following state-
ment, so that others may know what to do when the
awful fact is evident that a life is in danger of being
lost: —In September, 1906, my little girl, aged at that
time 3 years, contracted Measles, and in the following
October was attacked by Bronchitis, Pneumonia and
Congestion of the Lungs. She was attended by a
legally qualified doctor of high standing, but his treat-
ment was not successful in arresting the progress of the
illness. On Saturday, the 21st October, 1906, he said
that her life was in danger—that there was very little
hope for her. For eight days and nights she had been
prostrated by Cough, Pain and Fever, and was lying
like a statue, unconscious. At this stage I was per-
suaded by a friend to obtain Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure,
with its auxiliary medicine for the Fever and Conges-
tion of the Lungs, as directed in the Catalogue of
Medicines which accompanies each bottle of the Bron-
chitis Cure. I gave the medicine as directed, and there
was an improvement from the first dose of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure. The improvement continued after
each dose of the medicine. In a week she was perfectly
free from the Pneumonia, Congestion, Cough, Pain and
Fever, and was well, except that she was still weak. In
a fortnight she was quite recovered, and is now in
splendid health, and stronger than ever. Any person
asking for information about this grand medicine can
be supplied by me, or by any of my neighbours who have
witnessed its wonderful effects. It absolutely snatched
my child from an early grave.—Yours gratefully,
D. GARDINER,
Police Station, Geelong East, Feb. 5, 1908.
BRONCHITIS.
A Sufferer 73 Years of Age.
Thoroughly Cured by Two Bottles of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Immediate Relief-Effect Wonderful.
Mr. Hearne. Sir, —I was very ill with Influenza
and Bronchitis. A friend of mine persuaded me to try
your Bronchitis Cure. The first dose gave me imme-
diate relief, and after taking the second bottle I am
thoroughly cured. Its effect on me has been most
wonderful. I am 73 years of age. I trust you will
make use of this statement by publishing it for the bene-
fit of humanity Yours most respectfully,
THOMAS R. TRF.ZISE,
Reedy Creek, Victoria.
PNEUMONIA and PLEURISY
cured by
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
I, Prudence M‘Kee, of Carr-street, South Geelong, in
view of the importance of a person making it quite clear
what treatment was successful in curing a serious and
complicated case when the medicine, directions and treat-
ment of a legally qualified doctor had failed, state as
follows:
My son, Henry M'Kee, then aged 8 years, had been
attended by a legally qualified doctor, who pronounced
him to be suffering from Pneumonia, Pleurisy and a
stoppage of the passing of Urine. Under the doctor’s
treatment the child gradually got worse, and the doctor
pronounced the case hopeless. He told me that the
child could not live. At this stage I obtained from
Mr. W. G. Hearne, Chemist, of Geelong, a bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and gave it to the child, ac-
cording to the directions which accompany each bottle
of it. The child improved after the second dose of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure. He continued to improve
each day from each dose of Hearne’s Medicine alone, and
within three days he was free from the Cough, Pneu-
monia and the Pleurisy, and the Urine was passing satis-
factorily. He was out of bed at the end of a week,
completely recovered, and he is now in perfect health.
PRUDENCE M‘KEE,
Carr-street, South Geelong, Feb. 6, 1908.
CONSUMPTION.
Too 111 to Leave His Bed.
A Complete Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir,- —I am writing to tell you about the wonder-
ful cure your medicine has effected in my case. About
three years ago I began to cough. At first the cough
was not severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became
very weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my
chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On several oc-
casions there was blood in the expectorated matter. I
had been treated by a doctor who pronounced my case to
be consumption, and various other treatments had been
tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage that I
heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a
course of the medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill
to leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two
lots of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure,
for which accept my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,
I. BLAIR.

BRONCHITIS and PLEURISY.
A Severe Case Cured by Two Bottles of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
After Other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. Hearne, Chemist, Geelong.
Dear Sir, —Some months ago, in Sydney, I suffered
from a severe attack of influenza, and was confined to
my room for about a week, at the end of which time,
feeling somewhat better, I got up and tried to transact
my business as usual. But I got up too soon, for the
very next day I had a relapse, and suffered tortures from
what the doctor told me was pleurisy and bronchitis.
The pain from the former in my chest and shoulders
was frightful, and for four long weeks I was confined to
my bed under the care of a well-known Sydney doctor,
and all the time his medicine gave me but temporary
relief. The landlady of the hotel (the Cleveland), where
I resided, told me of a medicine —Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure —from Victoria, which had cured her of a bad at-
tack of bronchitis and pains in the chest, and begged
of me to try it. I did so, and, in thanks and gratitude
to you, tell you that, after the second bottle, my cough
had ceased; but what is more astonishing, the pains from
pleurisy entirely left me, and in about a week I was able
to attend to my duties as usual.—Yours faithfully.

ASTHMA-A 17 YEARS CASE.
Previous Treatment Failed.
Cured by Three Bottles,
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, wrote: —“After suffering from asthma for
seventeen years, and having been under a great many
different treatments without benefit, I was induced to try
Hearne’s Medicine for Asthma. After taking three
bottles of this medicine I quite got rid of the asthma,
and since then, which was the beginning of 1883—fifteen
years ago—l have not had the slightest return of it.
The medicine quite cured me, and I have much pleasure
in recommending it.”
Speaking in February, 1908, he states: —“I am keeping
very well. Never have the slightest return of the asthma.”
“ Hearne’s Medicine cured me of Asthma, from which
I had been suffering for twenty-five years, during which
time I had used almost every patent medicine on the
market —including asthma inhalations—without getting a
cure. It was 8 years ago that the cure was effected
by Hearne’s Medicine, and I now feel stronger than I
have felt for years—in fact. I feel splendid.”
C. WISEMAN,
Meredith, Victoria.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of HEARNE’S Bronchitis Cure has induced a number of
unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling has medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of deceiving
the unsuspecting, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that HEARNE’S
Bronchitis Cure has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to thas fact, and to request you
in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARSE’S, and see that you get it.

Doom.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUT of my house at evenfall I came,
Burned onward with a dim perpetual
flame
Of old disquiet, new awakened
By some far voice of the embalmed dead
That look upon me round about my room.
Out of my house of stone at dusk I came,
And standing, gazed upon the street of stone,
A flare of traffic in the night’s wide gloom.
With still feet on the footpath, I alone
Watched Sydneyside go by me like a dream.
From flare to flare sped jarring labor on,
With grinding wheels, sharp footfalls, clattering
hooves.
So thought I then. I, standing silent, seem
The only one whom no commotion moves ;
And the whole vast of murmurings was gone
And a new multitude along the grooves
Of hurrying custom ground, and light and sound,
Heaved like a curving wave upon my brain.
My eager feet devoured uneven ground,
Out of its passing swoon the old grey pain
Raised up its serpent head and hissed at me,
And I was ringed with midnight and the sea.
The black unfathomed wave on Bondi rolled,
Eternally murmuring the answer old
To the old riddle of humanity.
“Peace and unrest, peace and unrest,” it saith,
“Mortality shall solve that riddle yet.”
But now and then a gust of petulant breath
Blew in on me, and all that vast profound
Roared in a storm of half articulate sound
Furying that humanity, beset
With tiny snares, drones on. And blinded eyes
Feeding on'knowledge care not to be wise,
And the profoundest mysteries forget.
“Doom!” the incessant surges murmured,
“ Doom !
I am thy judge, the hoary, inveterate sea,
And if mankind find not my harmony,
Dissolving in the vast it must make room
For one more huge and warring energy
That yet shall bud from out this withered bloom.”
The strange star-fires that wander in the deep,
The crying wind that swings about the steep
Storm-beaten headlands, and the moon-white
sand
That like a goddess lies along the land
In dreamless sleep, all murmured, “Hear thy
doom.”

Captain Grain’s Revenge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ HERE’S more goes on at sea nor
I what Lloyd’s know, nor what gets into
the papers,” said the big, pock-marked
Irish sailor. “ Oi’ve followed the sea for twinty
y ears _Oi’ve sailed over ut, and swum in ut, and
fought on ut, and broken eight of the Tin Com-
mandments on ut. The other two Oi’ve broke on
land. But that’s by the way—an’ Oi wance had
a touch o’ the sun at Port Said.
“What did Oi say about Lloyd’s? Oi’m cornin’
to ut. Did yous iver hear iv the thramp steamer
Sarah Springhall? No? An’ yet the affair was
cabled all over the world, an’ come out in all the
papers from Archangel to Melbourne town—that
is, parts of ut—an’ for the rest ivery sailor-man
on ivery sea an’ in ivery pub knows what become
of Captain Larry Grain, an’ why we done ut.
“‘The steamer Sarah Springhall has bin
wrecked,’ said the papers, ‘ upon the Albalones, a
desolate group of islands near the northern coast
of Formosa. Out of a crew of thirty-one men
only six were saved. It is conjectured that the
captain, being prevented from taking solar obser-
vations by the thick weather, had ignored, in his
dead reckoning, the set of the current toward the
group.’ There now ! An’ that’s all you know,
an’ that’s all Lloyd’s know. An’ Captain Grain,
him who made the error in his dead reckoning,
can’t say aught else now, because he’s dead and
damned. But the common sailor folk know,
because Oi told some, an’ George Paston told a
few more when the dhrink was in him.
“ We had a nigger on board when we started
from Melbourne that thrip—the skipper picked
him up dhrunk one night outside Antonio’s,
where the Russians an’ the Dagoes an’ the Dutch-
men an’ the Bluenoses all booze together quiet an’
friendly. Moind, Oi don’t think ’twas all his
fault in the long run, but ut all come about by
what me and Captain Grain done to him. An’
yet we had to do something when we found out,
which we did on the fourteenth day. We’d
dhropped Townsville then, an’ the Cross was
hangin’ very low down astern. Oi remember
that because when the splash But that comes
afther.
“ This nigger had a disease that no man names
when it gets as bad as he had it. The men
thought ut was smallpox, but Oi knew what ut
was, havin’ had a mate that died of ut in China.
You know what Oi mane—the Chinayse disease—
an’ ivery sailor man knows, and the sickly little
clerruks out iv the shops an’ warehouses say they
know, an’ laugh about ut. But they don t if
they saw ut they’d die iv the fear. Oi wandher a
bit, p’raps, but Oi always get back. _ Don’t moind
me’. Oi had a touch o’ the sun in Port Said,
wance. They say Oi’m a bit quare. Well, ’tis
quare things Oi’ve seen.
“ The captain says to me, ‘Mick, what ails that
son-of-a-gun of a nigger that he’s lyin’ in, an’ the
men are growlin’?’ Oi told him. ‘He’ll niver
work more, captain,’ says Oi. What, says he,
‘ is he that bad ? Shipped aboard my ship to loaf
the whole voyage, an’ maybe die on my hands
blast him ! ’ He looked out over the sea, tuggin’
at his beard. ‘ What are the men sayin’, Mick ? ’
“‘The men are sayin’ that if he don’t die or
get shifted from the fo’c’s’le they’ll stop work, sir,’
SrIVS Ol*
“ ‘ Where the Hell am Oi to shift him ? ’ says he.
“‘Don’t know, sir,’ says Oi. An’ he looked
me square in the eye an’ Oi looked at him, an’ he
looked out to sea again.
“ ‘ He’ll die soon, eh, Mick?’ says he—by the Lord
he was a hard-moinded divil was Captain Grain.
An’ afther he said Oi had misundherstood. What
would you have undherstood ? ‘ He’ll die soon,
eh Mick?’ What ilse could ut mane, f’r the love
° f my touch o’ the sun has made me a bit
wake in the head—Oi may not have got Captain
Grain right. But over the nigger went that night,
an’ Oi reminiber how the reflections of the Gross,
low down, shivered in the splash he made. .
Dead ! Well, perhaps he was. The shadows and
the lift o’ the wave might have desaved me, an
his arms mightn't have moved. An’—ut may have
bin only the scream of an albatross Oi heard. Oi
wasn’t froightened to handle him, though few
others would have done ut. An’ he was only a
nigger, afther all.
“ An’ then Oi went below. ‘ The nigger’s dead,
sir,’ Oi said to Captain Grain.
“ ‘ Is he ? ’ says he.
“ ‘ He is,’ says Oi.
“ ‘ Overboard ? ’ says he.,
“ ‘ Overboard,’ says Oi.
“ ‘ Take a dhrop,’ says he, pushin’ over a bottle
o’ squareface.
“ Oi took wan.
“ An’ then, at Singapore, they took me an’
Captain Grain ashore, because the other men got
talkin’ in the pubs, an’ they put us on our thrial.
An’ we were acquitted, an’ the captain went back
to the ship wid the black hate in his heart against
the men whose jaws had got loose and risked his
neck. What was the charge? ’Twas said we
murdhered the nigger. Yes, by law we were
acquitted, and the crew got Hell when we stood
to sea again. One man said he smelt death in the
ship—y’ know there’s a sort of quare, musty smell
in a vessel that’ll niver reach port again. An’ all
excep’ me swore they’d desert when we got to
Vladivostock —if we ever got there.
“Up along Formosa it come on to blow as
though the Devil had pulled all the strings of all
the winds at wance, an’ when the wind fell, lavin’
a heavy sea, the sun was hid in a thick white mist
—white as the face of a dead man—an’ the cor-
posant rode on the masthead at night. Have you
ever seen the corposant? Man, ’tis an awful
thing—a great blue ball of fire with a little fierce
spot in the midst loike the eye of a devil. An’ it
glows, an’ glows, an’ makes the men’s faces all blue
against the dark sea racin’ beyant the sidelights.
An’ one of our deck hands swore he saw the face
of the nigger grinnin’ out of this wan—he was a
superstitious sort of chap. Oi’m superstitious too,
but Oi wouldn’t be froightened if all the ghosts in
the sea come out of it. Oi’ve seen a good many,
too.
“So we butted through it with the deathlight
on the fore, an’ at the dark hour before dawn, me
an’ Captain Grain bein’ alone (on deck on the
bridge we were) he spoke to me.
“ ‘Those swine below near hanged us, Mick,’he
says.
“ ‘ Yes,’ says Oi.
“‘By God! there they are, some in the
stokehole, an’ some in their bunks, an’ Oi have
their lives in my hand.’ He looked up at the
deathlight, an’ Oi thought by his eyes he was mad.
Oi think now he was. Mad or reckless—’tis the
same thing, wid p’raps a sloight bit of difference
on the Day of Judgment. He alone knows now,
but p’raps some day when Oi go where he’s gone
he’ll tell me amid the flames.
“‘D’ye hear the breakers?’ he says. Oi
listened, an’ Oi heard them plain.
“ ‘ What are breakers doin’ here?’ Oi asked
him.
“ ‘ Hark !’ says he.
“A boom like the echo of a field gun in the
hills tould me we were right on top of whatever it
was. ‘ Captain, for the love of Mary ! ’ says Oi.
“‘’Tis the Albalone Rocks,’ he said.
‘Dhrowned loike the swine ye are ! ’ he went on,
glarin’ down as though he saw the men sweatin’
at the furnaces deep in the belly of the ship.
“‘You’re not goin’ to wreck her,’ Oi said.
An’ ‘ Wait an’ see,’ says he. What was Oi to
do ? Captain Grain had tould me to wait. Oi
waited.
“ She sthruck loightly on wan wavefall, an’ rose
again on the send of the next. Then we shot in
against a broken wall of white, wid teeth of black
stickin’ out of ut an’ bitin’ through the plates.
‘There!’ laughs the captain. ‘The dogs—Oi’ve
dhrowned them.’
“ ‘You’ve dhrowned us all,’ says Oi.
“‘What the Hell does it matter?’ he sneers.
‘ We’i\none of us fit to live. Who heaved the
nigger o'ser ? ’
“ Wid that he cloimbed down from the bridge,
an’ Oi sat down an’ buried my head in my hamds,
cryin’ at his words. D’you think ut was fair to
say that to me that had done what Oi did for him ?
Oi may be a bad wan—Oi may be a bit quare in
the head —Oi had a touch o’ the sun wance, you
know. But Oi think that was ingratitude. An
he thought so too, because, at the end, he looked
at me, him bein’ bound an’ ready—‘Ye poor, mad
divil,’ he said. ‘Oi was hard on you too.’ Those
were his very words—would Oi be forgettin’ them ?
“ The seas broke over the Sarah Springhall an’
flung the men off to their death as they come on
deck. Oi called out to two of thim that Captain
Grain —God forgive me, Oi thought he was dead—
had dhrowned them for their talk in Singapore
about the nigger, an’ one, George Paston, cloimbed
up on the bridge, an’ Oi tould him all there was
to tell, an’ laughed in his face as the bridge swung
over an’ spilled us off, an’ the sea took us. Oi
think the Captain must have gone overboard as
soon as he reached the deck.
“Thirty-wan men there were on board, an’
seven only came up on the beach aloive, for there
was a beach behoind the ring of rocks. An’ of
that seven Oi was wan, and George Paston was
another. There was only six at first. We found
each other by callin’, an’ Oi tould them all what
Oi’d tould Paston—what the Captain had done,
an’ what a brave man he was, an’ what dogs they
were, an’, loike dogs, they snarled at me. But
George Paston kept them off me. * He’s half mad,
boys,’ he said. An’ below, in the grey dawn, we
saw the bodies of some of the rest washing up an’
down in the foam on the beach, with their hair
streamin’ loike seaweed, an’ their faces loike wax.
“One body lay high up between two little
rocks, an’ when we went down to ut we saw ut
was Captain Grain. As we looked he moved a
little. Oi went to take him up, but the rest pulled
me away. ‘To Hell with him—chuck him back !’
they cried. But George Paston stopped them.
‘No; wait till he can feel ut,’says he. By-and-
bye he opened his eyes. Then the others tied his
hands an’ feet, an’ carried him, me cryin’ behind
them, to a high place over the sea. An’ here they
laid him down on the crackly, wind-dried grass.
“ * Now,’ said one, ‘ we’ll pay Captain Grain for
24 men.’
“ ‘ I’ll pay for my sister’s man,’ said another.
“ ‘And I for my brother’s son,’ said another.
“‘And I for a 10-years mate,’ said George
Paston. ‘ An’ Mick will pay for all—and the
nigger. Take him up, Mick ! ’ #
“Oi lifted him, an’ he smiled at me out o’ his
battered face, an’ said what Oi tould you.
“ ‘Oi can’t,’ Oi said, an’ laid him down again.
“ ‘Then you go, too,’ said George Paston.
“ ‘ Don’t be a fool,’ said Captain Grain.
“Well —not a sound out of him as he fell. It
was a horrible distance, but he was a brave man.
Oi should have shrieked. Oi can see him turnin’
over an’ and over now, an’ the waves leapin’ up
to meet him.”

BILIOUSNESS
A Sydney Lady’s Perfect Cure.
TP the liver is in a healthy condition, the bile flows freely, thus pro-
moting assimilation. When the liver becomes sluggish in its action,
the stomach and organs of digestion are overworked. Pood is not
ĥ
ħ
digested and carried through the
system as Nature intended. It accu-
mulates, causing flatulence, sickness
and often vomiting, or, in other
words, Biliousness. Bile Beans are
Nature’s own cure for Biliousness
and all liver troubles, as witness the
following case -
“ I suffered very severely from bilious-
ness, accompanied by nervous debility,” says
Mrs. A. Daines, of Maloney Street, North
Botany, Sydney. “On getting up in the
morning everything seemed to turn green.
I would retch fearfully, and be compelled to
go back to bed, for if I did not I would faint
away. All thought of food was out of the
question. My neighbors did all they could
for me in the way of home treatments, with-
out any good resulting, and finally advised
me to see a doctor. Whilst out walking with
my husband I fainted in the street. He took
me into a chemist’s at Redfern, and pur-
chased a box of Bile Beans. This was the
turning-point. On arriving home I took a
dose of the Beans, and being satisfied with the
result, underwent a steady course, and after
taking the contents of two boxes I was
thoroughly cured. I cnn confidently recommend Bile Beans to fellow-sufferers from
biliousness and nervous debility.’’

a
Chance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SO it seems, looking hack, as if Chance did all,
That the scroll was not written beyond
recall
Long ere we knew.
That our love was not part of a pattern planned ;
Blind Chance but lifted a listless hand
And gave me you.
As I stood, so it seemed, on the beach of Night,
Some soft thirtg, wonderful, helpless, white,
Passively sweet,
Meek spoil that the somnolent Ocean gave,
Chance-flung on a dead, chance-lifted wave,
Lay at my feet.
No ! Destiny marked us each for each ;
Fate flung you, helpless, within my reach ;
But I was wise.
This strange sea-wrack before me thrown
I might have passed, unknowing, unknown,
With blinded eyes.
But did I not in the Infinite
Some soft thing, wonderful, glimmering white,
Strangely discern ?
And did not you, in the far Sea-drift,
To the shore where I waited your eyes uplift
And toward me yearn ?
Was it careless Chance that drew my feet
Beneath the low moon your soul to meet
By the Ocean’s rim ?
I had always dreamed of you, lost, alone,
And, but half-recalled, I had always known
A secret dim. . .
And, somewhere afar, or perilous-near,
Your low voice calling I seemed to hear;
But ah ! your name?
Yet I knew that this loneliness was not all,
And eternally craved, and at last my call
You heard—and came !
For in lives long dead I knew your eyes ;
And my love is but that I recognise,
Remembering.
And I could wait—as in lives before—
Till the loyal years to me once more
Your soul would bring.
Thus, thus, I remember your dear eyes shone !
In the twilight time of the ages gone
Did our love begin !
On no hazardous currents of aimless seas,
But the long sure surge of the centuries,
You drifted in !

ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The Killers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HIT some big fishing in October last.
Picture 1 was a squad of killers rounding
up a black whale inside the heads of Twofold
Bay(N.S.W.). A mountainous sea was running
in from the nor’-east; a wet, white sky and blind-
ing rain squalls kept us moist behind the ears.
Across the hills of water plunged the narrow-
beaked whaleboat; behind throbbed a 50ft. launch,
lifebuoys at hand, emergency spears and harpoon
gun stowed for’ard. At the wheel stood a hawk-
eyed youngster from Eden, who has steered
through the death-wash of a dozen black whales.
Everywhere ahead the squall-rent sea was white
and full of ravenous hollows eager to engulf us.
The half-castes in the boat pulled like devils.
Mardoo, and Greig the harpooher, taunted them
with the word “ slowbacks,” and they responded
by shooting farther ahead of the motor-driven
launch.
Where were the killers ? One man hinted that
they were sulking near the South Head and
wouldn’t work. It was stated that a new-chum
half-caste had struck one with an oar a week or so
before —a criminal offence not likely to be
repeated in the presence of an Eden whaler. For
the porpoise-like whale-sleuths of Twofold Bay
know their own worth, and the slightest insult to
their dignity is never forgotten, as the men from
East Boyd know. Without their immediate assist-
ance there would be little or no work for the
score of men who live by the bones and oil taken
from the wandering cetaceans.
A hundred yards ahead through the sheeted
rain the water became suddenly flurried, as
though a marine ploughshare were slicing the sea
in halves—it was the wake of the killers travelling
in triangular formation in front of the boat. They
sighted the launch, and were gone in a flash. But
not for long.
A hoarse, siren-like bellow filled the salt-way,
unutterably mournful and sad, and—“ Look,
look, for the Lord’s sake ! ”
I glanced beyond the harpooner’s pointed finger
and saw It through the grey sheen of a three-
fathom wave, trudgeoning from side to side,
rolling its giant shoulders like a wounded ship.
And the cry that 'came from its vitals suggested
the trumpet of the Resurrection.
The killers were everywhere now, like dingoes
around a hurt steer, • charging in under the ex-
posed fin, snapping, rending the great black sides
with torpedo swiftness. A pair of veteran killers,
nicknamed “Jim” and “Barney,” shot under
the heaving mass; a moment after the water
grew red where their jaws clung and severed huge
strips of blubber from the cetacean’s side.
“These Eden killers on’y want a stockwhip
behind ’em,” shouted the captain as “Jim ” and
“ Barney ” rose to the surface rending their strips
of blubber to pieces.
The black whale rolled and vanished until the
relentless killers worried it to the surface. And so
the fight went on until the harpooners finished the
hard-driven leviathan with spear and toggle-iron.
Whale-anchors were attached to the dead ceta-
cean to keep it from drifting out to sea. The
great head sunk far into the water. Within 24
hours, the accumulating gases would again lift it,
balloon-like, to the surface. It would then be towed
to the trying-out station at Kiah, East Boyd
The whalers’ quarters are far more comfortable
than any shearers’ huts I ever saw. The tucker
ranges from boiled schnapper, trevalli, baked
bream and mullet to mutton and fresh beef and
hunks of Bega cheese.
The whaling crew, mostly half-castes, laughed
heartily over certain portions of Bullen’s “Cruise
of the Cachalot.”
“Ef Bullen ever helped to cut up a right whale,
or a humpy or a finback, he’d know better than
say they feed on pilchards,” said the harpooner,
huskily. 1
I pressed him to explain.
“ it’s this way,” he continued. “ When a
whale’s feedin’ on britt—it floats like a prawny
weed on the water—a few fish get entangled, an’
the whale strains ’em through its jaws. Chaps
like Bullen sees a few fish in the beard, an’ think
it’s been eatin’ em. Rot! Now, ef Frank had
ever helped to cut up a whale, he’d never have
made that statement in the ‘ Cruise of the
Cachalot.’ ”
I hinted that Bullen’s books had passed muster
throughout the world without adverse comment.
“ That’s so,” grunted the harpooner. “There
are about six people, between South Ameriky an’
Norfolk Island who’ve looked into a whale’s
gullet. I don’t know how many there are up
North. You’ll admit, though,” lie said dryly,
“ that the critic fellers don’t go whalin’ between
drinks.”
After tea Captain Davidson showed me a sheaf
of bone and oil receipts from various Australian
firms, which proved beyond doubt that the old
harpooner Greig was responsible for the lives of
187 black or right whales.
And this happens in Australia where men are
always writing about cows and sheep !
ALBET DORRINGTON.
The Thing.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITH a hunch of diaper tucked
beneath his chin the heavy person in
evening dress violently attacked a stack
of French peas.
He had come in late, and even at this stage his
second pint of wine was under Percy’s care.
The room was half-filled with diners.
The man sat near the door. Far down the
room, near the street windows, another man sat
with a woman. The woman, rose-cheeked with
wine and frocked in conspicuous clothes, found
her greatest pleasure 'in frequent sips from her
glass.
The stout man’s gaze was every now and again
upon the woman. Her back was turned to him,
but her companion, sitting against the wall, could
view the whole room.
The pea-eater ate and drank with no regard for
the nerves of his neighbors. He kept on with his
meal, stolidly, and commenced his second pint,
every now and then letting his gaze wander to
the couple at the top of the room. He was a
quick feeder, and arrived at his brandy while the
woman was eating a pink ice.
Shortly he opened his case and took out a fat,
black cigar.
Percy dashed eagerly up with a taper, and the
man sat back and blew up a cloud of pungent
smoke.
Presently he took his bill, and slipped it into
his vest-pocket, putting a coin on the table for
Percy. Percy immediately seized upon the stout
one’s coat and hat, and lay in wait for him by the
doorway, full of doglike attention.
The large man got up and walked down the
room towards the couple.
Percy watched, with a sparkling eye, and
people half-turned in their seats to covertly re-
gard the monster who strode among them.
He came up to the couple, his eyes upon th,e
man. The man suddenly knew fear, and his
fingers stole towards his wineglass, but not to
carry drink.
Gooch, the fat man, stepped up, and the woman
noted the quick pallor of her companion. She
turned, very swift and still, and without shrink-
ing. Gooch took the cigar out of his mouth, the
tip of it burning bright crimson as he did so. He
bent his face to the woman’s, with his hands be-
hind him, as though to disclaim any intention of
personal violence.
The woman—not moving from him, for there
were so many others in the room ! —caught at the
edge of the white table-cover, and moaned, under
her breath, very softly.
Gooch bent down over her, and deliberately
blew his great mouthful of cigar-smoke into her
face; and she still sat, without moving and with
a fixed smile on her mouth. And Gooch smiled
broadly, too, and stood a moment, looking down
at her. Then he looked across the table at the
man and smiled at him also, and walked away,
back to where Percy waited near the door.
The man looked at the woman in a ghastly
silence, but with the flesh of his lower jaw quiver-
ing and twitching.
Then “ The butcher ! ” he said, snarling.
The woman, yet smiling, stared at him, and
then burst into a little peal of laughter.
What was almost a sigh of relief ran among
those who had seen.
“ A joke !” murmured someone, and the side-
ways watchers went on with their eating.
But the man got up, shaking.
“ Come on ! ” he said, “Come on! Let’s get
out o’ this place ! All these people ! ”
“O,” she muttered, “ you fool ! Why didn’t
you laugh ? Why don’t you laugh ? Or break his
neck ? ”
The man took no notice, but turned in haste and

60 years Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla has been tested and tried.
It is known as the one great family

South America, Egypt, Australia,
Africa, or wherever you will
k there you will findthisfam-
ily medicine ready
to give relief.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
removes all impurities from the blood, at the same time
making the blood rich in life-giving properties. It restores
the appetite, strengthens the digestion, and thereby enables
one to obtain full benefit from his food.
Accept no cheap and worthless substitute. Be sure that you
get AYER’S Sarsaparilla—as now made, it contains no alcohol.

WHY
can they not be built with wheels 100, or even
50 feet in diameter ?
BECAUSE
the weight of the wheel would break its one-
