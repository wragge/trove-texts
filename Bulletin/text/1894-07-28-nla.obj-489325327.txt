“ THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tb.e Bulletin.,’ 9
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy ,
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One .Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be
State monopoly.
The election of Ministers by Parlia
ment, instead of Party Government o
rather Government by Contradiction.
Anew Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present
the other to be chosen by the whole
cxnxntry voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance,
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers o:
the day. It is only the remainder that is founc
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is nol
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses 'a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes,
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its_ lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com*
meroial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily ana
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of Th-e Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, it*
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
CUBED BY USING
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkervllle, S. Australia, writes:
‘•Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
\l
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.” •

HORLIGK’S
MALTED
MILK.
A PERFECT FOOD.
An artificial food for Babies should
contain every element of nutrition in
proper proportion, in order that the
growing child may receive nourishment
that produces a normal and proportionate
growth of muscle, bone and flesh.
Horlick’s Malted Milk is such a food.
It is made of the best Cows’ Milk, com-
bined with Wheat and Barley, specially
prepared and adapted to the needs of the
Growing Baby, who, when fed upon it
(not over-fed), is far less liable to attacks
of Cholera-Infantum and Marasmus than
when other artificial or any starchy
foods are used.
sabi^s
Fed on Horlick’s Malted Milk (which
contains no starch) are always in good
health, and, consequently, never show
that crossness and peevishness which is
a sign of bad nutrition or ill-health.
Endorsed and recommended by the leading
Physicians of Englani and America.

A Hymn of Maorilaud.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
How blest our islands of the Morn,
The diadem of lonely seas,
Where the Almighty’s smile is born
To follow westward with the breeze J
For first on us the light of God
Each matin from the Heaven is bowed.
Swift as the fury of the sword,
Soft as the rainbow in the cloud.
Around us are white-woven waves
That ne’er have felt a tyrant’s heel.
That roll above old heroes’ graves
To thunder in a breaking peal;
And overhead the snowy scars,
Where never foot of man hath clomb,
Point to the everlasting stars
That lustre all the southern dome.
Glad rivers from the forests flow.
Or fall in frolic from the peaks.
In myriad flowers our spirits know
The sweetness of creation speaks;
While thro’ the woods low murmurs run,
Blent voices from the circle sea
That whisper we and they are one,
Bred of the ocean and as free!
The thunder of the moa’s gorge
Shall be our answer to the foe ;
As sparks that feather from the forge
Our souls shall rise in battle’s glow,
So Peace shall wreathe our iron capes
That frown defiance to the foam,
That smites with fury and escapes
In hissing fury to its home.
Wellington (M.L.).
HUBERT CHURCH.
Australian salt-bush is cultivated exten-
sively in the Orange Free State (S. Africa) and
thrives well there.
An English magistrate, at Chester, has
established a valuable precedent by binding over
an elderly spinster in the sum of £lO not to sing
in church any more. According to the evidence,
the lady had a high, gritty voice, and never by
any chance struck the right tune, and moreover
she was generally two or three notes in arrear.
When she sang the choir had to stop to laugh,
and then the spinster boomed along by herself,
and utterly demoralised the organist. The most
vigorous remonstrances couldn’t induce her to
leave off singing, so she was brought before the
police-court with the above-mentioned result.
A religiously-inclined young man of 26
lately advertised in a London paper his desire to
get married on “Phrenological principles” to
“any lady having the same desire.” Very likely
he will be a happy husband, hereafter, when the
bumps of his wife’s head have become much more
important than the features of her face, or the
curves of her figure. It were better to fall in love
with a chart drawn by an experienced phren-
ologist—a chart that blends well with your own—
than to get mashed on a photograph, or take the
original for what she seems in the pale romantic
moonlight. The real trouble is to find a girl who
has any bumps at all.
“ Ouida ” is hard-up in her mature age-
Most of the money earned by her gorgeously
impossible yarns has been expended upon attempts
to live like the heroines, and the balance was
lost in wild plunges after untold gold. Life
without riches, and statuary, and a perfumed
boudoir and priceless bits of china, etc.,
must seem a desert to this literary mother of
colossal guardsmen, but for the present she is
being retrenched. Her Italian palace and fittings
were lately knocked down by a prosaic auctioneer,
and the red glory of the pomegranate blossom has
passed from her declining years, in a Ouidaesque
manner of speaking.
To-Day, J. K. Jerome’s organ of new
gloomour, is like nothing so much as a hearse
whose driver is continually vociferating that
somebody has stolen his crape. Even poor Austra-
lia is dragged into following the funeral by “the
Australian Kipling,” Guy Boothby, who would
be aptly named but for the fact that he isn’t
Australian and isn’t Kipling, and describes a billy
as a “saucepan.” This is the sort of thing the
Australian public will have to suffer until it learns
to print its own books, and make up its own mind
and value its own writers. There is any amount
of good Australian talent going a-begging while
people rush to buy worthless books because they
have an English imprint. Yet if the same books
were printed here by native workmen they would
languish neglected on the booksellers’ counters.

IMITATORS
With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmakfhg is unknown,
has decided to supply hrepatrons at the lowest cash price.

No matter how far in the interior you reside, ELLIS’S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands

tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS’S

SATURDAY, JULY 28, 1894.
The New South. Wales Political
Quicksand.
The New South Wales general election has
left the politics of the province in much the
same chaotic condition as it found them.
Possibly they are even a little more chaotic
than they were before ; they are certainly
no less so. The Protectionist majority has
gone to utter wreck, and the Dibbs Govern-
ment, left with only 42 followers, is prac-
tically defunct. It came by its fate, partly
because the country was tired of it individu-
ally, partly because the country gets tired
of all Governments in turn, and generally
“sacks” the ruling faction at the earliest
opportunity. The Labour-party has lost
considerably, and returns with 24 members,
divided into two warring factions, instead of
the one tolerably solid party, about 36 strong,
which it mustered after the election of 1891.
And the Foreign-trade party—the shoddy
faction which lias fooled away fifty years
of the political life of the province, and has
left nothing behind it save a load of debt and
a vast mass of wasted opportunities—is
apparently coining back to power once more.
The country vote—the vote of the agricul-
tural and pastoral interests—was strongly in
favour of Protection, but the overgrown
metropolis, which produces practically no-
thing, and lives by levying toll on the com-
merce of the producers, gave an almost
unanimous Foreign-trade vote, and turned
the scale in favour of the Calico-Jimmy in-
terest. The Labour vote was diffused almost
equally over the country, so the contest was,
in the main, one between the producers and
the non-producers, and the non-producers
have won.
The position of the dominant Foreign-
Trade party, however, is a remarkable one.
It consists of so many disconnected pieces
and fragments and irresponsible scrag-ends
of opinion that, at present, it hardly
deserves the name of a party. It includes
the genuine Freetraders—the only Free-
traders worthy of the name that have yet
appeared in New South Wales politics—who
want to make trade really free, and to com-
pensate for the loss of customs revenue by a
land-tax of 4d., or as much more as may be
necessary, in the £. It further includes a
hybrid variety of Freetraders, who propose
to levy a land-tax of Id. or |d. or Jd. in the
£—not as a matter of principle, but as a
grudging concession to the popular move-
ment of the day—and to collect about
£2,000,000 a year through the customs.
This body differs very little from the exist-
ing Protectionist party save in the fact that,
instead of levying duties where they may
assist some local industry and provide work
and wages for the people as well as produce
revenue, it proposes to levy them where they
can be guaranteed not to assist any local
industry, or give work or wages to
any one, or produce any effect whatever save
that of raising prices to the consumer. And,
finally, there is a third, or National Ass, sec-
tion, which is prepared to die in the last
political ditch rather than permit the levying
of any land-tax whatsoever, and which is
prepared to accept the present Protectionist
tariff as it stands, if necessary, so that the
Treasury may be able to get through without
resorting to the hated expedient. This
section refuses to call itself Protectionist,
and wishes it to be distinctly understood
that it will take no further steps towards
Protection, and will accept the existing tariff
for revenue purposes only ; otherwise it has
no visible connection with Freetrade, save
the name.
• * «
The more or less officially recognised leader
of the Foreign-trade party is G. H. Reid ;
its more or less unrecognised leaders are
Parkes, M‘Millan, and Wise. G. H.
Reid represents the feeble and half-
hearted section which proposes to fish
for the vote of the land - tax party
by an attenuated impost of Id. or less in
the £ on unimproved land values, and at
the same time to pander to the old,
high-dried revenue tariffists by raising
£2,000,000 annually in Customs duties.
Wise is the most prominent man among those
who want to abolish the Customs revenue,
except in so farasnarcotics and intoxicants are
concerned, and live entirely upon land taxa-
tion. Pakkes is the hope and stay of the Ass
party, which cares very little what may come
to pass so long as the land-tax is averted,
and which proposes to raise the neglected
spectre of Federation by way of drawing
attention off the troublesome fiscal issue.
And M‘Millan would belong to the same
section as Parkes only that he and his one-
time leader are now barely on speaking terms
with each other, that he cares nothing at all
for Federation, and that he insists on having
a tariff' constructed in the interests of the
softgoods trade. Among all these con-
flicting opinions the Foreign-trade party is
almost too discordant to be worth calling a
party.
# # •
One Foreign-trade organ, the S. M.
Herald, is already beginning to urge that
Parkes should jump the leadership ; the
other, the Telegraph, enthusiastically advo-
cates the claims of G. H. Reid. The
Herald represents the conservative, or
National Ass, section of the Foreign-traders,
and in its anxiety to avoid the threatened
land-tax it already begins to suggest, in a
thin, small voice, that the present tariff
might possibly be left undisturbed. The
Telegraph represents the land-tax element;
at one time it represented the 4d. in the
£ element; now it represents the Id. in the
£ and modified revenue-tariff element.
Wise, the apostle of the uncompromising
land-taxers who want to sweep the Customs
entirely out of existence, is acting as the fugle-
man of Parkes, who is in favour of no land-
tax whatever, and under these circumstances
his position—if he has one—is hard to define.
Several of the most prominent Foreign-
traders have disappeared from the scene
during the late election, and- the fact that—
with the exception of the unnatural alliance
already mentioned between Parkes and
Wise— the remainder are hardly on speaking
terms, makes it probable that the new
Ministry, when it is formed, will be mainly
a scratch assemblage of new men, and more
an experiment than a serious attempt at
Government.
* * #
When the land-tax question comes up for
settlement —as it apparently must, in some
form or other, with the next financial state-
ment —that section of the Foreign-trade
party which declares war to the knife against
the great land-holding monopoly can reckon
on receiving a practically unanimous vote 4 from
the Labour-members. On the other hand,
the conservative Foreign-traders, who abhor
a land-tax above all things, will bo power-
fully supported by the old Protectionist party,
whose fatuous leaders have declared, almost
as one man, in favour of the landlord interest.
As for that middle party of which G. H.
Reid is the figurehead and chief ornament —
the party that is trying to steer a middle
course between Single-tax and hopeless con-
servatism—its prospects are eminently un-
certain. It may fall to the ground between
two stools, or its half-hearted policy may be
accepted as a compromise lest some worse
thing might happen. In any case, the
Assembly is so hopelessly disorganised upon
this question that the Upper House will
probably decide that the Land-tax can be
safely rejected, and will reject it accord-
ingly. It is only when the Assembly is
practically unanimous that it can scare the
Council into accepting any strongly Demo-
cratic measure, and, in the present instance,
the Assembly is as far from being unanimous
as it well can be. Under all these com-
plicated circumstances, Premier Dibbs’
resolve to meet the Legislature and wait for
a direct vote of censure is the only course
which a politician with an intelligent eye to
his own interests could reasonably adopt.
There are so many possible and impossible
complications in view, that no one can say
what may or may not happen.
# * •
Whatever else the new Parliament may be
good for, its value as a guide to the senti-
ments of the majority of the nation is about
nil. The delegates of the people represent
three different varieties of alleged Freetrade:
absolute Freetrade, the old bogus revenue-
tariff variety, and a new kind which is hardly
distinguishable from the Dibbs Protectionist
policy. They represent three kinds of
land-taxers: the Georgian variety, which
proposes to make the land the sole source
of revenue ; the modified species, which
proposes to substitute land-tax for Customs
duties only ; and the still more modi-
fied species which proposes to run a
revenue-tariff and an infinitesimal land-tax
side by side. There are also two different
varieties of Labour members in the new
House, sundry species of Federationists,
Protectionists of various degrees of intensity,
and many other shades of political opinion.
Why these people got there is, at present,
unascertainable. Whether Freetrade came
uppermost because it was largely connected
with the land-tax policy, or whether the
land-tax came uppermost because of its con-
nection with Freetrade, whether Protection
went down because its leaders were opposed
to the land-tax, or whether it would have
gone down worse if they hadn’t assumed
that position, and which variety of Freetrade,
or which degree of Protection, or which
species of land-tax, or which kind or sort or
description of anything really represents the
sentiments of the majority of the people,
remains as profound a mystery as ever.
Nothing has been settled on any coherent
basis, or on any other basis, and nothing
seems likely to be settled. Only as the
democratic sentiment grows stronger, and
the number of political issues increases, the
confusion of Government by Contradiction
grows worse confounded, and nothing in the
existing system can do anything towards
bringing order out of the prevailing chaos.
John Bull’s Peaceful Conquest.
Editor Bulletin,—No reader of The Bul-
letin need be more than reminded that
money is the value by which things are
exchanged as distinguished from the value
for which they are exchanged. The ob-
ject of exchange is to get goods, not
money. This is what political economists tell
us, and it is a doctrine I have preached time
and again. But it must be owned that it is
never good to be sure about anything political
economy teaches, and many debtors are begin-
ning to find out to their cost that money has
an intrinsic property much more powerful than
its utility as a basis of exchange. The man
who, on the prospects of his wool-clip, incurred
a debt ten years ago, when wool was a shilling
a pound, and is required to pay up now that
it is selling at less than sevenpence, has
very just cause for thinking he is compelled
to pay one-half more than he bargained for.
The farmer in Donegal who took his land on
lease when wheat was selling at seven shillings
a bushel, naturally jibs at paying the same rent
now that grain is down to 3s. 3d., through the
operation of some obscure economic law just as
much beyond his control as a wet winter.

Since the beginning of history there has been
trouble about money as a standard of deferred
payments. Moses forgave debts every 50 years,
and more’s the pity his descendants cannot be
made to do the same. Throughout Grecian
and Homan history there is a constant recur-
rence of the demand by ruined debtors that
silver should be changed for brass—that is, for
the scaling down of debts. In the year 85, 8.c.,
Cornelius Cinna cut down debts by three-
fourths, yet 36 years afterwards Julius CUgsar
felt called upon to make another reduction,
probably equal to one-half of the amounts
owing. Right through the middle ages
to the discovery of America,' we may
trace the power of capital and the
powerlessness of the debtor to struggle against
the inefficacy of money as a standard of
value. Now and then the debtor had his little
bit of diversion, especially when the creditor
was a Jew ; but the pulling out of a few teeth
was poor compensation for a fall in values that
pulled the borrower out of his castle or cottage.
But, after all, there is no need to go back for a
moral to the days of Julius C.esar, or even
those of the Jew-baiting kings—the present day
offers sufficient and glaring opportunities for
observing the peaceful conquest of the debtor
by the creditor.

Since Gosohen invented the term, there has
been much nonsense talked about the apprecia-
tion of gold. The learned pundits, who write
for the Argus and the Herald, talk knowingly
about the fall in prices due to the appreciation
of gold, whereas the two expressions are merely
different modes of defining the same pheno-
menon. But it may be asked, what has all
this to do with John Bull ? Very much, as we
shall see. Since 1873, J. Bull has kindly lent
his neighbours and relatives large sums of
money, of which some 1200 millions sterling are
yet outstanding. During the same period gold
has so appreciated that a debt of twenty shil-
lings now owing is as heavy a charge as thirty
shillings would have been in 1873, because
goods then worth thirty shillings have now the
value of only two-thirds that sum. The money
lent by John Bull, therefore, entails the same
burthen as 1800 millions would have done had
prices not fallen. The fall in prices has, there-
fore, benefited the creditor country, to the
detriment of the debtor, to the extent of 600
millions sterling—and this in twenty years !
• • •
The appreciation of gold has already ruined
Spain, Italy, Greece, the Argentine, and other
debtor nations ; it bids fair to ruin India, and
may yet destroy some of these provinces.
John Bull has behaved all through the
piece like a veritable Shylock. When
Egypt showed signs of disclaiming obliga-
tions too hard to be borne, England put
in her red-coated bailiffs ; in India her man has
been in possession since the start, as he has been
in Ireland also. Every nation worth consider-
ing, England always excepted, is anxious that
something should be done to rehabilitate silver
and to stop the fall in prices, which is ruining
debtors all the world over. But J. Bull is not
a debtor—on the contrary, his mortgages extend
over half the world, and daily grow more valu-
able. At former prices, the interest on India’s
debt to England represented in silver—which is
India’s money —fifty million ounces; now the
quantity required is eighty millions, while the
unfortunate country groans helpless under the
added burthen.
* * *
Australia is tributary to England to the extent
of over fifteen millions sterling annually, to meet
which the country has to send away one million
and a half bales of wool, whereas at former
prices a million would have sufficed for the
same weight of obligations. Let it be granted
that the fall in prices theoretically increases
wages, because the same quantity of money
will now purchase a larger quantity of the
necessaries of life than formerly; but this at
most proves that some are benefited at the ex-
pense of others. Then there is always the
doubt about the some , for in what country is
the toiler able to save for his old age ? If he
has cheaper living, he has to suffer something
else that more than wipes out the gain. The
fall in prices benefits the creditor and the man
with a fixed income, while it tells against the
debtor, the man whose income is uncertain,
and the one who has fixed payments to make.
Without doubt the majority fall into the second
group, and are, therefore, not benefited. All
the Australian provinces are ranged amongst
the debtors, and the troubles that now beset
their Governments are due more to shrinkage
in values than to any other cause. But
their obligations to their creditors do not
shrink. As late as three years ago Victoria
had a total revenue of <£8,340,000, but of this
<£5,240,000 was spent as it was earned, being
the cost of running trains and working the
posts and telegraphs, or was required to meet
fixed appropriations such as interest on loans
and obligations under Acts of the Legislature.
For the past year the total revenue was
<£6,700,000, and the permanent charges and
cost of maintaining services <£4,750,000, leaving
,£1,950,000 to carry on the business of govern-
ment, as against .£3,100,000 available for 1890.
Victoria is cited, not as a shocking example,
but simply because it is the province I happen
to know most about. The figures just given
point to a suspension pending reconstruction,
for unless prices stop their downward course
the government revenue from present sources
will vanish. I do not pretend to saddle J.
Bull with responsibility for Victoria’s present
position, but as the one nation responsible for
the deplorable condition of money as a standard
of deferred payment, these provinces ought to
let England distinctly understand that if she
wants to get back her principal, or even the
interest on the 250 millions owing by Aus-
tralia, she must join with France, Germany,
America, and the other nations in their effort
to avert ruin.

But Brummagem cries out that there is no
danger of repudiation ; no English'speaking
people ever did, or ever will, repudiate. This is
the same stolid ignorance that claims Waterloo
as an English battle. I was in America when
Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Minnesota, Ten-
nessee, and Virginia repudiated, not Con-
federate debts, but obligations incurred for
ordinary State purposes. Speaking English
will no more stop a people from declining to bear
unjust obligations than speaking Chinese, so the
argument may be neglected. One thing
is very plain, Australia cannot pay its debts if
the price of its staple products fall much lower.
Bimetallism has been suggested as a remedy.
It ipay or may not effectively meet the diffi-
culty, but, at all events, it is an intelligible pro-
posal, and deserves consideration. John Bull
is not disposed to adopt this or any other
remedy for falling prices, and for a very suffi-
cient reason. If the appreciation of gold can
be continued for another decade, some of
England’s commercial rivals will be so crippled
financially that their competition in the markets
of the world will be ineffective for at least a
generation. Meanwhile these provinces lan-
guish, and it is one of the blessings springing
from the British connection that Australia can-
not make its voice heard in the councils of the
nations, except through England, to whom its
interests—in this and many another important
matter—are entirely opposed.
H. M. WINTHROP.
Some Possible Complications.
A few days ago an obscure little message fil-
tered down from Townsville, and was lost in
the obscure little corners of the Southern press.
It said that the residents of the Northern Ter-
ritory of South Australia were forming a league
to agitate for constitution as a separate province
or a Crown colony. Thousands of readers
passed it by without understanding and without
interest. Yet those few lines may contain the
germ of issues vitally important to the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth. Our nascent nation
has not yet so firmly established its footing as
to bo secure from external aggression. The
thirteen States of the American Union, cramped
narrowly upon the eastern borders of the con-


tinent, suffered many a tremor before progress
had extinguished the fear of foreign rivalry,
and included the Centre and West in one
homogeneous Republic. Australia must also
overcome two great dangers : the one arising
from her connection with Great Britain ; the
other from her contiguity to the dormant, but
tremendous, power of China.
• • *
Of these risks, our association with Britain
is at present the greater. At any moment,
Britain’s European relations may embroil us in
European warfare, from which we have every-
thing to lose and nothing to gain. Charles
Dilkb, one of the ablest critics of foreign
notifies, recently asserted that the first effort
of a European nation at war with Britain
would be to strike a blow at the rich and
tempting provinces of Australia. This fact is
persistently concealed by the Imperialistic
press, but it forms the conclusion to which
every thinker must come. Britain is in no
position to protect us; she would have difficulty
in protecting herself; and the so-called “Aus-
tralian” squadron, which is the result of the
nefarious Naval Tribute Act, and which we
build and maintain without owning or control-
ling, is worthless as a defence of such an ex-
tended coast-line. As a portion of the British
empire we invite hostilities from nations which
would never dream of attacking an independent
Commonwealth. Naturally, British statesmen
arc only too glad when, besides accepting the
risk of the British connection, we show our-
selves willing to pay for the privilege.
* • *
The danger of attack from China, if more
remote, is no less real. China is an unknown
quantity, which at any moment may take com-
mand of our calculations. Given a Timour or
an Alexander on the Imperial throne, with the
ambition to plan conquest and the brain to
execute his plans, and it might go hard with
our infant republic. The Chinese make good
soldiers, though they seem averse to war ; and
leaders and navies are only a matter of money.
The wealth of Australia already excites Chinese
cupidity ; and the sacrifice of a few million
lives is nothing where so many myriads remain.
To convert the Northern Territory into a
Chineseprovinceis the easiest thing in the world.
Already Chinese control the mines and agricul-
ture of the Palmerston district, and partly
control the commerce and shipping. At the
census of 1891 the Chinese mustered more than
three times the number of Europeans. For all
practical purposes, the community is a Chinese
community with a sprinkling of whites.
* * *
That a European population of 1159 all told
should set up responsible government is a dream
hardly to be taken seriously. That the pro-
vince should retrograde into a Crown colony is
even more inadmissible. The first result m ould
be the appointment of a Governor like Anthony
Musgrave, and the importation of Coolies and
more Chinese by the thousand as a first step to
exploitation of the vast natural wealth of the
territory. Some such scheme has been seriously
considered by South Australia, and but for
Premier Kingston’s Democratic tendencies an
attempt would probably have been made to
carry it into effect. Already the Chinese have
worn a track from Port Darwin to every pro-
vince of the group, easily evading the poll-
taxes. Chinese junks land upon the Northern
coast passengers by the score and hundred at a
time. To dam this current will be one of the
first tasks of Federated Australia. While
Federation is pending its force must beas far as
possible curbed.
• • •
Until the Northern Territory can be taken
over by the United Commonwealth, South
Australia must bear the burden she was so
eager to assume. The history of the Northern
Territory is a curious history of disappoint-
ment. Thirty years ago, when the Adelaide
Government obtained a temporary cession of
the province (which has never been made per-
manent) it was confidently looked to as a source
of revenue. Peddling mismanagement has con-
verted it into a source of debt, which now
totals about £300,000. Every penny spent lias
been spent grudgingly, and the effect has been
to daunt settlement and destroy industry.
Revenue meets expenditure, but an interest
charge of £70,000 a year is strangling progress.
Were a comparatively small additional sum—
say £lOO,OO0 —expended in making the re-
sources of the Territory available to enterprise,
and a liberal land system adopted to encourage
immigration, the Northern Territory would
speedily become solvent and prosperous. South
Australia, having put her hand to the plough,
should not turn back. And the pressing need
of adequate northern coast control is yet
another reason to hasten Federation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Little Things Dovetailed In.
The Bulletin once knew a N.Q. parson who
was wont to remark, when christenings multi-
plied : “ Dear, dear ! first a boy and then a
girl; then a boy and another girl—how these
little things do dovetail in !” In a similar
admirable manner the resurrection of Brisbane
Figaeo dovetailed into MTlwraith’s return to
Australia. Figaro is a paper which leads the
twilight existence of the little pea under the
thimble—now you see it, and now you don’t;
also a paper which wicked slanderers (in past
existences, to be sure) have dared to call
MTlwraith’s journalistic jackal. In the
beginning of June, MTlwraith came home, and
Figaro started a fresh existence as a penny
weekly. About the same time, a circular
announcing a new paper —which, of course, was
not Figaeo —was issued in Brisbane. It stated,
inter alia :
The paper is being run under the auspices of the
Government and the pastoral and planters associations,
and is designed to counteract the pernicious teachings of
l a eleven labour papers now being supported in Queens-
iand. ... I am subsidised with money to a small
xtent. but many of the leading business houses have
promised me support 'with advertisements. ... If
you take sufficient inter* st in the scheme to care to make
further enquiry, I refer you to Mr. Tozer, the Colonial
Secretary.
There really seems to be no end to the usefulness
of Mr. Tozer though, perhaps, his nam e
was used without authority ; and—although th c
circular could not possibly refer to Figaro —it
is interesting to see that the Queensland banks,
which do not advertise much in these hard times,
support the new venture liberally. All three
are represented—the Q.N. with a column, and
the Royal and North Queensland with half-a-
column each ; while the Courier, the leading
Brisbane daily, has no standing bank advertise-
ments at all. Figaro also gets a column from
the British-India Steamship Co.—the mail-
line subsidised by Government; a page from
White, of Alfred Shaw and Co.—the typical
Brisbane “ fat ” who struggled so hard for the
mayoralty, and who, in the exuberance of his
zeal for law-and-order, spends his holi-
days in barracking for the Government ;
and liberal support from Webster and
Co. (one of the largest Queensland wholesale
houses), B. I). Morehead (biggest Q.N.B.
shareholder), and other typical representatives
of corpulence. The first issue of Figaro let the
cat out of the bag. Under the heading of “A
State Bank ”it was coolly suggested that the
Government should take ,£1,000,000 worth of
shares in the Queensland National Bank—
which, of course, is no more “ National ” than
any wild-cat company would be, except in the
sense that it has been trusted (between our-
selves) with £3,000,000 of the nation’s money
which, at present, it isn’t convenient to repay
—and become responsible for another £1,000,000
worth. As these £8 shares, £4 paid-up, are
now quoted on Sydney Exchange : sellers,
7s. fid. ; buyers, Is., it can be understood
with what gratitude the shareholders wel-
comed this lucky inspiration. Unfortunately,
the public were strangely lukewarm. The
Courier, in reprinting the article, headed it—
“ What Does This Mean ?” and failed to answer
its own question with any degree of lucidity.
So the project is not being pushed for the pre-
sent, and as cash is absolutely essential, the
Government is going to start more “ reproduc-
tive works,” which means another loan and a fresh
addition to the £3,000,000 and more already in
the banks to the Government credit. “If I were
not Alexander,” said the great Macedonian,
“I would be Diogenes.” Similarly, if The
Bulletin could not be the Queensland Govern-
ment, it would be a Queensland Bank—or,
better still, be both Government and Bank,
Alexander and Diogenes rolled into one.
The Resurrection of H. Farkes.
The S.M. Herald now backs Paekes for the
leadership of the Foreign-trade party in New
South Wales, while the Sydney Telegraph
bets its whole pile on Reid. When this ques-
tion is fought out it ought to decide, for many
years to come, which is to be the leading daily in
the province. The next leader of the Foreign-trade
party will be, in all probability, the next Premier
of New South Wales, therefore the paper which
comes uppermost in the struggle will make the
next Ministry, and if the paper which can
make and unmake Ministries is not the leading
paper of the province, it is difficult to imagine
what is the meaning of the term. The issue
between Paekes and Reid, which was until
lately exceedingly nebulous and ill-defined, is
beginning to take definite shape. Reid pro-
poses, not Freetrade and a revenue derived
mainly from land-taxation, but a heavy revenue
tariff, and a rather vague and uncertain land-
tax of Id. in the £. Paekes, on the other
hand, proposes to let the tariff stand very
much as it is in order to obviate the necessity
for a land-tax—in other words, he, the Free-
trader of butter-and-bacon duties fame, pro-
poses to call himself a Freetrader and accept an
alleged Protectionist tariff as a matter of
necessity—and to make Federation the leading
feature of his policy. Everything else is to be
postponed in order to make room for Federa-
tion, but as Australia can’t federate until the
other five provinces are ready, and as they
show at present not the slightest sign of
being ready, this simply means a general
postponement of every internal reform for
an indefinite period. To all intents and
purposes Mr. H. Paekes might as well
announce that the first consideration is to
convert the whole population and get its soul
ready for heaven, and that until the last
sinner in New South Wales is fully prepared
to meet his God all other legislation must
stand over as a matter of secondary importance.
Still the signs of Paekes’ resurrection keep in-
creasing. The old man already returns thanks to
thecommunity for thesuccessof “myparty,” and
in a general way he professes to brush Reid
aside as he would a small and unconsidered fly
from the summit of his own venerable cranium.
If Dibbs had resigned as soon as the result of
the elections was known, a Reid Cabinet would
almost certainly have been formed, and then
Parkes would have been running his head
against an accomplished fact, which would be
very different from running it against a mere
hazy probability. But Dibbs, who beneath his
outward assumption of blundering frankness,
is now and then a very wily diplomatist,
means to do nothing of the kind. He will wait
until Parliament meets, and while he is waiting
Paekes is overtaking Reid with seven-league
boots, and the great Freetrade-party is steadily
disintegrating between them.
On a Certain Perverter of Patriots.
The ingenious “ Outis,” of Sydney Telegraph,
is prone to prefer pretty paradox to dull truth
—“as if (in Bacon’s phrase) it were greater
praise to know what might be said rather than
what should be thought.” It was this bias,
doubtless, which led “ Outis,” after inveighing
with some justice against that parochial
patriotism which, as in China, counts all other
nations barbarians, to go' farther and say that
“ there isn’t one infinitesimally tiny mite of
difference between the snobbery which prizes
noble lineage and that which differentiates the
man born in Parramatta from the man born in
Bristol.” By which “ Outis ” conveys the im-
pression that love of country is a sounding
phrase, and that the spirit of nationality which
shone at Thermopylae and elsewhere, is a thing
to be eliminated from human nature as quickly
as possible. Whereat the average citizen
who will still mouth you sonorously some
school-learnt scraps of “ Breathes there a man !”
—is grievously perplexed. So The Bulletin
rises to explain that both logically and senti-
mentally, “ Outis ” is in the wrong. He is so
logically, because Australians have the right to
govern their own country in their own way. It
is at present a very confused way ; but we are
gradually accumulating a stock of distinctive
traditions, and ideas, and aspirations from
which our national life will by-and-bye
be moulded. To be a man from Parramatta
is, more or less, to inherit those aspirations,
to be a partaker in that life, to be permeated
with that sense of fatherland which is a signal
source of the heroism of humanity. To be a
man from Bristol is to be controlled by a totally
different set of thoughts or prejudices, which
may or may not be ethically better than ours,
but which, at any rate, are not ours. Thus
between Australian and Australian there is
established a bond of sympathy upon which,
other things being equal, the man who seeks the
suffrages of Australians has every right to
icckon. And “Outis” is in the wrong senti-
mentally because the highest patriotism can co-
exist with the noblest altruism. Tom Paine,
author of the most magnificent altruistic maxim
ever penned—“ The world is my country, and
to do good is my religion,”—was author also of
“ The Rights of Man,” and a foremost defender
of the infant American Republic against the
aggressive might of Britain. His enthusiasm
for humanity did not prevent Comte from
recognising that a man’s duty to his family
and to his country, if narrower in scope
is more intense in essence, and is equally sacred
and laudable. By all means teach Australians
to abhor that vulgar Chauvinism which
degrades “ Civis Romanus sum!” from a
national watchword to the label of a faction ;
and to honour themselves by according to all
strangers upon an equal plane of civilisation
equal welcome and respect. But let us teach
them also to count their birthright a precious
and inalienable privilege, in which they may
justly glory, and for which, if need be, they
may gloriously die.
«.
“Fortunately."
Lee and Cummins, the two Barraba (N.S.W.)
murderers, were successfully hanged last Friday
at Tamworth, in Premier Dibbs’ new electorate.
The only incident which disturbed the sym-
metry of the proceedings was the attempted
suicide of Cummins, who severed an artery in
his arm the night previous to the execution, and
nearly bled to death before his condition was dis-
covered. As it happened, however, his heavy
breathing attracted notice; a warder and a
doctor attended to him, and, as the Evening
News feelingly observes, the “bleeding for-
tunately ceased,” and he survived to be taken
to the gallows, almost insensible, in a hand-
cart, and strung up according to law. Why
the bleeding “ fortunately ” ceased passes com-
prehension, unless it was that, if it hadn’t
ceased, the next day’s show would have been
utterly ruined. On any other basis it is im-
possible to discover anything fortunate about
the circumstance. Professedly the law only
wanted to be eternally rid of its prisoner, and
he was fulfilling his destiny just as fast as he
could when he was interfered with. Which-
ever way he died he would have gone to the
same place—if there is any place in particular
to go to. If anything extra was to happen to
him in the next world—supposing there is any
next world—for adding suicide to murder, he had
already incurred that extra liability—whatever
it is. He didn’t spend the interval between
his attempted suicide and his execution in
making any preparations for a blessed here-
after ; he was practically insensible all the
time, and he was still semi-insensible when the
butchering took place. There is no possible
reason to suppose that he gained anything
either in this world or in the next by the inter-
ruption ; he hardly even gained the miserable
privilege of living a little longer, for he didn’t
know that he was alive until he was artificially
revived just in time to be hanged. So far as
it is possible to discover, the circumstance on
which the Noose felicitates itself was only
“ fortunate ” because it prevented that paper
being deprived of sundry loathsome and revolt-
ing details which helped to boom its circulation.
On every ground of public decency, it is a pity
that every condemned criminal isn’t allowed to
suicide privately and unobtrusively in his cell
in whatever fashion he thinks best. Then there
would be no story of the gallows for the evening
papers to relate, and when there was no
“copy” to be made out of the gallows, that
institution would presently fall into neglect and
disrepute.
A “ Ferson of Evil Fame.”
One of the remarkable results of the labour
difficulty in Central Queensland was the recent
arrest, at Winton, of James Maetin, an official
of the Australian Labour Federation, on a
vague charge of “ being a person of bad
repute.” There was no single overt act alleged
against Maetin, so, it being impossible to
make even a show of suspecting him of crime,
he was virtually accused of being believed by
some person or persons unspecified, to be a
man who would be likely to commit some
crime, also unspecified, at some future time,
date not fixed. He was also charged, in
effect, with looking as if he might be a
person who had committed some undis-
covered crime in the past; and on the strength
of these suppositions - or, rather, on the
ground that he was supposed to be a per-
son to whom these suppositions might be
applicable—he was ordered to find sureties
to the extent of <£2oo that he would be of good
behaviour for the space of six months. If
Martin hadn’t been able to find the sureties he
would have thereupon been sent to gaol, not for
any visible offence, but merely on the charge of
being alleged to be supposed—by a Fat Man’s
by a bench of Fat Men—to look
a,s if he might be going to commit some offence.
This corrupt and disgraceful proceeding M'as
taken under the Vagrant Act—the most far-
reaching instrument of despotism ever invented
in an allegedly free country. Under its pro-
visions any inconvenient person whom the
Government, or the police, or the local bench,
or any other authority wants to remove out of
its way, can be arrested and gaoled under all
manner of circumstances. He can be arrested
for owning his own clothes, or his own money,
or his own pipe, on a charge of having
property in his possession reasonably supposed
to be stolen—which simply means that the
policeman says, on his own dunderheaded respon-
sibility, that he supposes they were stolen. If
he has nothing in his possession he can be
gaoled for having insufficient visible means of
support. He can be run in for being anywhere,
on the charge of frequenting a public place
with intent to commit a felony. He can also
be arrested on a vague charge of being reputed
to be a thief, or of being a “ suspected person”
—which only means that the policeman suspects
him, and is just as definite as if he suspected
the policeman, or they both suspected the
Sultan of Morocco. And he can be rushed off
to prison on the charge of being a per-
son of evil fame, which doesn’jj; even assert
that he is definitely suspected by any-
body, but only that the atmosphere is
alleged to be pervaded a vague feeling of
unrest as to his character. And he can be
promptly and efficiently gaoled for a long
period on any one of these indictments. But
none of these charges are ever brought against a
person of any social standing; even the man
who runs the most glaring bank or land co.
swindle in Australia couldn’t be arrested on a
charge of being a suspected person—though the
whole country suspected him, from Carpentaria
to the Great Australian Bight—without heavy
damages being awarded for “ unlawful arrest.”
The Act applies only to the labourer—to the
man in moleskins—and as an engine of class
tyranny and oppression it is absolutely un-
equalled.

The Farkes and the Fly.
One of the saddest stories of all his long
career was related by Paekes the day after
his election at St. Leonards. A young
Australian candidate, a University man, it
seems, wrote to him in an enthusiastic strain
to state that he had got in, that he was
glad he had got in, that he was glad Paekes
had got in, that he was glad and blissful
generally right down to the soles of his boots,
and that he hoped the old man “ would not
withhold from him his guidance when he
entered the Legislative Assembly.” And
Paekes, with the artificial glass tear of emotion
shining on his furrowed cheek, remarked that
all this was very touching. So indeed it was,
for it indicates that another bright Australian
has been Lost. Paekes is a vampire who eats
young politicians, and this one has deliberately
come along in a dish with a knife and fork stuck
in him, and asked to be eaten. The spectacle of
Paekes “laying for” a young and tender member
on his appearance in the House is well-known.
Sometimes the new arrival sidles up to Paekes
and makes overtures, and in that case the
process is short. Generally, however, he takes
no notice of the veteran, and for a time the
veteran takes no notice of him—he merely
studies him from a distance. But, at last, one
night he ambles gently across and sits down
beside the weak little stranger, and starts talk-
ing—generally about literature. “ Hi was
reading ha most remarkable book, the bother
day,” is probably how he begins. Then the
new member makes some profoundly stupid
and flat observation about the book in ques-
tion, and Paekes looks at him with a look
of astonishment and boundless admiration.
“ We-e-11,” he says, ruminatively, “ that his a
most horiginal view of the case. I have con-
sidered the matter myself in many haspects,
but that haspect never hoccurred to
me. Your hidea throws a hentirely new
light hon the subject. It hevidences deep
and the old man goes back to his
own seat and sits there buried in profound
meditation, evidently thinking desperately
hard over this new view of the matter. There-
after Paekes haunts that young member, and
admires his most stupid observation, until the
young member becomes, like Wise, his Smike.
He falls simply for want of some kindly men-
tor to turn a hose on him at the very beginning
and break up the conversation. The young
man who once begins to take Paekes is like
the young man who once begins to take opium :
he is lost. Almost the only youthful member
who never fell into the trap was Ceick, who
cursed the ancient mentor consistently from
the beginning; and consequently, despite all
his outrageous coarseness, he is the only young
politician for whom Paekes has the slightest
vestige of respect.
Beyan O’Loghlen’s chief objection to improve-
ments in the Victorian law of libel is as hollow
as the Irish baronet’s hat. Now is an inoppor-
tune time for dealing with the question, he
says, because Speight-Syme and similar actions
are before the country. But the suggested
amelioration of the libel-law has no sort of
bearing upon any railway cases, present or
future, and it so happens that the Law Courts
are for the moment clear of complainants whose
hopes could be shattered, or interests affected,
by a prompt acceptance of the proposed bill.
o‘Loghlen is merely mouthing the sentiments of
Patteeson and the land-boom party, who would
give much to have the local press muzzled
entirely whenever silence suited their purpose.
The most pertinent remark on the Government
attitude towards the Amendment Bill came
from Wilkins, M.L.A., the Collingwood
butcher: “Has there ever been a miscarriage
of justice as a consequence of anything nub-
lished in the press ?” He should have asked
whether fraud escaped punishment through a
newspaper report of facts, but Wilkins’sugges-
tion was distinctly to the point. O’Loghlen
replied that “he was not in a position to say
anything about that.” A lawyer so profoundly
ignorant of legal history can’t be in a position
to give an opinion about anything.
Prohibition is already coming home to roost
in certain parts of Maoriland. In some of the
Lake districts, where barley—mainly used in
the sinful process of beer-making—is the
principal crop, the farmers are combining to
boycott all tradesmen who support prohibition.
They reason that as the teetotal tradesman is
doing his best to destroy their means of sup-
port it is only fair to destroy his in return.
Also, the agricultural threepenny-bit no longer
goes into the plate of the teetotal parson, and

the teetotal labourer can hardly find a job In
all the Lake districts. A stupendous boom in
illicit distillation has also set in. One recent
find of 600 gal. was emptied into a creek, and
three cows which drank there died shortly
afterwards. Among the West Coast mountains
the business is especially active, and it is
vaguely estimated that nearly half the
fusel-oil sold in Westland has paid no duty.
Dunedin is compelled to levy a heavy special
rate to make up for the loss of licence-fees and
the falling-off in the gas revenue, and other
towns will probably have to follow suit. All
the same, The Bulletin hopes that Maoriland
will get absolute prohibition. It is an interest-
ing experiment to watch—from a distance—
and, besides, any community which is so foolish
as to want prohibition deserves to get it.
The Wild Cat Column.
The half-year’s balance of the Commercial
Bank of Australia shows that vast institution, with its 3J
millions (paid) capital, apparently going at a good pace on
the downward track. Last half-year it showed a net
profit of about £30,000 ; this half-year the net profits are
rather less than £BOOO. Last half it paid a dividend at
the rate of 5 per cent, per annum on preference shares—
apparently the only one it will pay for a very long time—
and the ordinary shareholders got nothing. This time
neither preference nor ordinary shareholders get any-
thing, and there seems to be no show for any of them on
the furthest horizon. The earnings are now at the rate
of about 9s. 6d. per cent, on capital, and the whole efforts
of the bank seem directed to scraping up enough money
to pay interest on deposits. If next half-year shows any-
thing like the falling-off of the one just ended, however,
even that can’t be done for more than two months longer
except by trenching on capital. The present awful posi-
tion is arrived at despite the fact that there is £17,000
less paid away than last half for “interest on deposits”
and that there is a saving of £2OOO in salaries, and £2OOO
in “ rent and other charges.” If it hadn’t been for these
savings the institution would have showed a big loss in-
stead of its lamentable £BOOO profit.
The attempt to ascribe these troubles to the 4J
per cent, interest payable on the reconstructed deposits is
mere gall and obscure financial humour. The Commercial
of Australia turned a large proportion of its deposits into
preference shares on which it pays no div. Therefore, it
only pays interest on the balance—equal to not quite 3J
per cent, on the original amount of the deposits, and if it
can’t earn that a large proportion of the £7,000,000 de-
scribed as “assets of the old bank” must be nearly hope-
less. It is reported, as a cheering circumstance,
that the greatest care is exercised in only taking
over from the old bank accounts about which
the board feels thoroughly assured, but as the
whole assets of the old institution, including those
accounts about which the board doesn’t feel thoroughly
assured, are included in the new bank’s balance-sheet,
the advantage of this extreme care isn’t very apparent.
Further, there is a joyous assurance that things will
mend as the liquidation of the old bank progresses, but
the said liquidation has progressed a lot during the past
six months, and the only visible result is that the profits
are £22,000 less than they were before the progression.
• • • • •
The same explanatory board states that the
difficulties arise because the profits are mostly “absorbed
in paying interest on the extended deposits which the
new bank has to carry.” Yet, if it didn’t pay one copper
of interest on any deposits, extended or otherwise, it
would only be earning about 4$ per cent, per annum on
its capital, and the visible inference is that the Commer-
cial’s affairs would be tolerably depressed even if it got
its deposits gratis. In fact, no matter at what angle it is
viewed it looks depressed.
« « * «
The City Bank of Sydney doesn’t improve
visibly as time goes on. A year ago it paid a stunted
div. at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, and had
£8 left out of its profits. Next half-year it paid 6 per
cent, again, and had £3lB to the good. Now the profits
do not even run to the same little div., and it is only paid
by encroaching on past accumulations. The most grue-
some feature of the report, however, is the announcement
that £139,132 has been written off the reserve to meet
“ascertained and possible losses,” whereby the reserve
goee down at one fell swoop to £lOO,OOO. The report
contains a gratifying assurance that this provision will
cover all losses, but considering that the last balance-sheet,
and the one before that, and all the preceding ones con-
tained the usual announcement that provision had been
made for " bad and doubtful debts,” the assurance is not
so assuring as it might be. If the former provision for
bad and doubtful debts was so lamentably inefficient that
£139,000 is wanted all at once to make things square, it is
difficult to feel quite sure that the present arrangement is
any more final than the ones which went before it. And
the City Bank can't well stand another such shook as the
present.
The City Bank has now a paid-up capital of
£400,000 and a reserve of £100,000; and, even assuming
that it makes no profit at all on its deposits and note-
issue, it is only earning £4 12s. per cent, on its share-
holders’ funds. The result looks as if a good lot
of the shareholders or the depositors’ money had
got locked up in very unprofitable and unrealisahle
investments somewhere. The proposal to sell
£1,000,000 worth of new shares remains in statu
quo and seems likely to continue there. The last sale of
the City Bank’s £8 shares was made at £4 25., and the
impossibility of selling new shares at their face value
while the old ones can he got at about half the money is
too obvious to require pointing out. At its present price
the stock returns about 12 per cent.—a splendid return,
if combined with reasonable security, in these days, to
the in\estor, and the fact that there is practically no
demand for this 12 per cent, investment shows that the
great mass of investors somehow regard the City Bank as
an institution to keep out of with enthusiasm. Under all
these circumstances, the chairman’s assurance that the
present balance-sheet—with its div. partly paid out of
reserves and its £139,000 written off—“ shows more
favourably than its predecessors,” sounds like a horrible
reflection on the accuracy of the said predecessors.
• • * *
The Queensland National Bank issues another
of those specially mournful balance-sheets for which it is
so famous. According to this lachrymose document, the
co. is able to pay a div. of 1J per cent, (equal to 3 per
cent, per annum) which absorbs £B4OO, and when this
is done there remains £llOO to strengthen the position of
the bank. The profits for the half-year just ended are
about £4OOO less than they were for the previous one, so
things which were bad enough before now seem to be acon-
siderable deal worse. The Q.N.B, has about £7,500,000
invested in various ways, and the miserably small amount
of profit can only be accounted for on the supposition
that a considerable proportion of the money is locked up
In comatose investments which at present pay no interest.
The investment which pays no interest also fails, in many
cases, to pay the principal. The deposits, so far as can be
ascertained from the balance-sheet, show a considerable
falling off, and as the Government deposits have largely
increased this apparently means that private deposits
have declined very heavily. The paid-up capital is £609,000
and nearly half of it is represented by premises and
furniture. Also the auditors, as usual, state in a vaguely
indefinite fashion that “in our opinion” the balance-
sheet fairly represents the condition of the bank “as
shown by the books.” This saving clause is regularly
inserted in the Q.N.B. balance-sheets, and it makes the
auditor’s certificate a mockery. Every balance-sheet
drawn up by any man in his right senses is correct
“according to the books,” but unless the auditors are
prepared to state openly that the books are correct there
is no earthly excuse for their existence.
♦ * ♦ •
Already one Fab Man organ gently suggests
that the Q.N.B. should issue a vast hunk of new stock—
£2,ooo,ooo or so—principal and interest to be both
guaranteed by the suffering country. Considering that
the Government deposits in the Q.N.B. are well on towards
£4,000,000, this would make far over Jive millions of public
money at stake in one unhealthy institution.
* * * *
The Bank of North Queensland, for the soveralth
time in succession, pays no div., and its entire net profit
for the half-year is only £1360. As this represents only a
little over 1 per cent, per annum on its paid-up capital
of £200,000, and its prospects seem to be getting worse,
instead of better, it appears to ne about time the B.N.Q.
gave up its respectable little ghost. It is plainly too
small a concern to pay a full-grown staff and a whole
board of directors. There is no room for baby concerns
like the B.N.Q. in these troubled times.

The National Bank of Tasmania, a very small
institution which was formed in 1885 out of the debris of
the Bank of Tasmania, pays a 6 per cent. div. (£3000)
with one hand and takes £15,000 from the reserve with
the other to meet losses. As the reserve is only about
£20,000, the National will need to walk a chalk line for
some considerable time after this mishap.

The financial statement of the Bank of Victoria
reads pleasantly in these times. The profits for the half-
year are £30,000, against £31,000 for the previous half,
and the institution pays a div. of 5 per cent, per annum
on all shares, and carries forward £6560. There are nearly
one and a-half millions in cash and liquid securities, and
altogether things look reasonably sound, barring the fact
that the Victoria shows no effort towards starting a new
reserve-fund, and is practically scattering all its profits in
dividends. Even 5 per cent, is about 5 per cent, too
much to pay for the first year after reconstruction.

The Universal Land and Deposit Bank (Sydney)
reports a profit for the half-year of £756, equal to 221 per

ascribed to an over-ruling Providence.

The Citizens’ Life Assurance Co. publishes a
statement to show that, after seven years’ labour, it has
“ accumulated funds ” to the extent of not much more
than one year’s income, and remarks that the figures
“speak volumes for the confidence placed in the co.”
They do, indeed. Moreover, as the funds include
£20,000 of shareholders’ capital, they aren’t all “ac-
cumulated ” by a long way.

The Royal Bank of Queensland pans out better
than is usual in the distressful land of the alligator. Last
half-year it made a net profit of £636o—almost exactly
the same as in the previous six months, and, considering
how the other Northern banks seem to be beautifully
fading away, the result is reasonably satisfactory. The
above amount is equal to about 5 percent, on capital, and
the Royal pays a little dividend of 2J percent, and carries
£2OOO to reserve. Said reserve now stands at the respect-
able figure of £25,000, and is steadily growing.

A Victorian M.L. A. is trying to shove through
a Bill which provides that no bank shall be allowed to
foreclose any mortgages tor the next four years, provided
the interest is paid regularly. The Bulletin trusts that
it will pass, and that a similar measure will be brought
forward in N.S.W. and Queensland. The banks have been
allowed time to save them from bankruptcy ; they should
be rmde to give it also, especially as the reason why the
banks’ debtors can’t pay is generally that ths banks have
annexed all the loose cash in the community.

As far as can be ascertained, the Bank of New
Zealand has kept straight and sworn off land-booming for
the past 14 years and more. It was the riotous Vogel
epoch in the Seventies that was its undoing, and all its
efforts since then, and all its reconstructions, haven’t
sufficed to put it straight. In finance, two years of cham-
pagne and boom mean 40 years of repentance.

The N.S.W. Monte de Piete, a steady-going,
joint-stock pawnshop which lends money at less than
half the usual rate of interest, shows its usual good
return. The net profits available are £4965, out of which
it pays a dividend of 10 per cent., adds £5OO to reserve
(making it £11.000), and sets aside £5OO to a contingency
fund for possible losses, making said fund £6091. The
Mont de Piete shares are about the steadiest and most
reliable of all those quoted on Sydney Exchange.

A block of land, ten miles from Melbourne, was
sold, in ’55, at 125 per acre. During the last boom it
changed hands at £5OO an acre, and a bank advanced on
it to half this amount. The hank has got it yet, and its
estimated value is back to £25 per acre—just one-tenth
of the mortgage. But it figures among the assets at the
mortgage value, and the institution lives on hope, and
the interest keeps accumulating at the rate of £2O per
acre per annum.

and 10s. in the £ tor anything not due before next
century. Reconstruction was dayT’lish hard on the
depositors, who had originally shown the most “ con-
fidence,” more especially after they protested against
being left out in the cold. Blake and Riggall's attempt
to stay the reconstruction scheme was founded on the
long-date deposit difficulty, and the Court's apology for
the gross injustice that was being perpetrated makes
interesting reading to-day.

The A.J.S. Bank, one of the few institutions
which is living up to the promises it made at the time of
its reconstruction, shows £37,391 available for distribution
as the result of the last half-year's work. A dividend of
5 per cent, absorbs £24,868 ; £lO,OOO is added to reserve-
fund, and the balance is carried forward. The reserve
now stands at £45,000 —an excellent result, considering
that it has all been accumulated in the 12 months which
have elapsed since the old A.J.S. suspended.

percent. What’s the matter with the A.N.A.? Many
foreclosed mortgages on the books, or merely because
their trustees were of the putty order of architecture and
lent_ money at 4 per cent, when everybody else was
getting 6 to 8 per cent, with perfect safety?

A reconstructed banking crisis seems imminent
in Melbourne. The press is calmly repudiating its fibs of
15 months ago. That ‘‘great ” organ, the Age, begins to
fear that “ the difficulties of fulfilling substantially all the
engagements entered on by the various schemes of recon-
struction will be materially enhanced by the natural
course of events since Easter of last year. But there
were no difficulties on April 7, 1893, when the same Agb,
exulting over the Commercial scheme, said : ‘‘Taking the
gloomiest view of the future, the depositors will not only
obtain increased interest for their money, but the security
they now hold in the shape of uncalled capital on shares
will still be theirs." Difficulties, indeed 1 Why the cable
had then brought the Age glad tidings of an advance in
wool, and all things were “ combining to lay the founda-
tions of returning prosperity in the near future.” The
article of April 7,1893, concluded with a joyous question:
“ Is there any reason, therefore, why a gloomy view should
be taken of our surroundings?” The Argus was blowing
its trumpet to a similar tune, and daily journalism in
general knelt before the altar of the reconstruction god.

Dear Bulletin, —Wyalong needs no “ cracking
up.” It requires crushers, nothing else. The plao* has
been handicappd by the permit-system and want of survey.
The rivalry between the two townships also causes
depression. The C.P. land between them has been
thrown open for mining but not for business or residence.
What does that mean ? Simply that there is a bias in
favour of the lower or surveyed township. Lavery’s
claim crushed well at Gough’s battery. The fact that
what is only reckoned a second-rate claim goes 3oz.
(nearly) shows the value of other ground. There is also
hard-swearing in court about fulfilling the labour-condi-
tions. Acres of unworked ground is represented fit to
swear by and is not worked. Persons interested in Grong
Grong, Yalgogrin, Murrumburrah and Reefton run Wya-
long.down. Still Wyalong is here and is Wyalong, a
home for miners for many years aUgood wages.—Yours,
S. le W., Wyalong, 15/7/94.

For the half-year, ending May 31, the Broken
Hill Proprietary raised 257,278 tons ore, producing
7,287,3370 z. silver, 25,638 tons lead, and 441 tons copper.
The cost of mining was £2 12s. 6d. per ton of ore ; of
separating and refining, £1 9s. 3Jd. per ton of bullion—
2s. 9Jd. per ton less than for last half. Nett profits were
£397,378, from which £288,000 was paid in divs., £24,000
as a bonus, and £15,000 carried to reserve. Nett liquid
assets on May 31 were £485,535. When the dead-work
attendant on the adoption of the open-cut system is over,
there should be a great gain. It is proposed to carry the
pits down to 300 ft. Since formation the co. has paid
£5,652,000 in divs. and bonuses, and the outlook is most
promising.

The Emerald mine, Yalgoo (W.A.), would
appear to be " a daisy.” When first discovered by the
prospectors, Pearse, Rice, Maxon, Parsons and Evans, it
was declared by alt as simply a very rich blow, from which
much stone was dollied. The property was placed under
offer to a Melb. syndicate, which subsequently sent a pro-
fessional expert to report on it. This expert condemned
the property. One Cape then offered to put machinery
on the mine for an interest. The offer was accepted. An
Otis mill was erected and several crushings took place,
giving returns of nearly 20oz. per ton. After the pro-
prietors had banked some thousands of pounds worth of
gold, another offer was made on behalf of Gibbs, Bright
and Co., but they did not close, and the prospectors not
only banked more gold than both offers combined
amounted to, but they have since opened up the mine to
an extent that proves it one of the richest properties in
W.A. The stone at grass and the faces in the mine are
described as magnificent.

Burbank, of the Birthday Gift mine, Oool-

the next claim on its line of reef proved a duffer, is well-
known on Qympie, where he travelled round without

“ Coolgardie teamsters are down in the mouth,”

Henry Dawson, one of the lucky Coolgardie
(W.A.) men who fluked across the Londonderry mine, and
who now expresses regret that Pete Carter and he so
quickly sold out their interest in that find, does not advise
any Eastern people to go to West Australia. “ God
knows,” he says, ‘‘l tried hundreds of reefs before we
found this one, and never got a colour. , . It was
wretched when we first arrived, but since, and where we
are at the mine, with plenty of good things, matters have
changed for the better. . . Carter only had ss. in his
pocket when we struck the Londonderry, and 1 was
reduced to £14.”

Ab Lyell Creek (M.L.), the Low Level Tunnel,

of apparatus to save gold from tailings, and many other
matters of interest to the miner.

Miss Hilda Spong’s luck, which began
badly a few weeks ago, is looking up a good deal
at Sydney Criterion. “ Pygmalion and Galatea
nromiaes to pay muoh better than its predecessors,
and the Ori. is gradually becoming a fashionable
house again. Also the company, which opened as
a weak and straggly affair, is getting into shape.
Miss Spong’s Galatea awakes pleasant memories
of a greater and brighter statue in the person of
Essie Jenyns. She doesn’t suggest that lady in
her appearance as the stone image, for then her
attitudes are cramped, and the light is badly
arranged, and in the uncertain shadows she seems
to be clutching her scanty costume with both
hands lest it should fall off. But as the live meat
Galatea, Miss Hilda is an emphatic success. Mrs.
Hayrnan’s Oynisca is also a most satisfactory per-
formance. This clever and comely lady was born
in Sydney, and, so far, has met with the sort of
encouragement usually extended to the natives of
a miserable country which imports nearly all its
celebrities.
« • •
Ohrysos, the obese art patron, in the out-
ward form and corporation of Mr. Fabert, is the
one unmitigated joy of the comedy. This actor
has been two years in Australia wrestling with
sentimental characters for which he was utterly
unfitted, and producing as a rule the most depres-
sing results. On Saturday, for the first time, he
got" a show in eccentric comedy, and absolutely
bloomed forth as the rival of Anson. Whether he
has Anson’s versatility remains an open question,
but as Chrysos he is as wildly humorous as
the lamented Geo. W. in his very best days.
Provided Chrysos isn’t a solitary eruption on
his part, there should be a great future before him
as Eccles and various other heavy fathers of the
beery and hilarious school. Miss Annie Taylor
does good work as the wife of this old Greek
wreck, and sundry depressing persons make up
the tail-end of the cast. One of these, who wears
a big helmet and a brief petticoat, and carries a
badly-stuffed deer under his arm, is mistaken by
the audience for a comic character, and is treated
accordingly. Consequently, when he makes a
tragic exit in his murky beard and his painted
legs, and with his armour rattling like a crate of
loose hardware, the excitementis tremendous. A
pretty comedietta, which consists almost entirely
of Mrs. Hayman, is thrown in, and goes with a
rush all through.

Parson De Witt Talmage, the hell-fire
preacher, was announced to open his entertain-
ment at Sydney Centenary Hall to-day (Thurs-
day) with a lecture on ‘‘The Bright Side of
Things.” Talmage, when he is in the full fury of
expounding the Scriptures, is reported to look like
a boa-constrictor possessed, throwing itself reck-
lessly up against the atmosphere amid a whirl-
wind of texts and exhortations, and if he lives ujp
to his reputation he ought to “ take well.” His
object in life is ta,bring the truth home to his con-
gregation or burst, ahd a full report of how he
bursts will appear in next issue.

Pettitt’s “Woman’s Revenge,” which now-

“ Uncle Tom” is settling down to be a very
good variety show and nigger minstrel entertain-
ment at Her Majesty’s. As an amusement of the
Jubilee Singers’ description, it is excellent, but
the community refuses to take little Hia's ascent
to heaven in a serious spirit, and doesn’t seem to
grasp the true inwardness of the situation when
Uncle Tom enters Paradise in his bald head and
his red shirt. In fact, the only person who is
taken seriously is Legree j and the management
makes the great mistake of trying to infuse an air
of comedy even into that sombre personage by
allowing Sambo to take a running kick at him
from behind when he is “in the horrors.” After
viewing the drama from many positions, The
Bulletin is impressed by the fact that there are
materials for an excellent burlesque in “Uncle
Tom,” provided the adapter doesn’t depart too
recklessly from the text, and assuming that little
Eva is allowed to let herself loose.

The Saturday nightmare at *Melb. Royal
was not “ A Grip of Iron,” but “ Under the
Gaslight,” a Murkan drama that used to shock
this continent in days of yore. Miss Maud
Williamson is the fundamental principal of
“ Under the Gaslight.” The programme describes
her as a belle of society, yet after the first act she
is simply a persecuted spinster, always trying to
escape from a hoary-headed man named Byke.
Byko has a deep, unfathomable purpose in view,
and Old Judas, a lady of evil disposition, helps
him all she can. Judas’s forte lies in discovering
the whereabouts of Miss W, to Byke, but the
fugitive generally foils their plots by jumping into
a river. In addition to Byke and Judas, there is
a stylish young man, from whom Maud William-
son runs away, and in the course of her
flights she pulls a one-armed soldier off a
railway-line, where Byke had left him to be
decapitated by the night-express. The collapse
of Byke ensues, and the dawn comes in the form
of the young man. Although there are but two
We may expect shortly to hear in public
a very pretty “Slumber Song,” by Harrison
White, which is dedicated to the well-known
soprano Miss Oolbourne Baber. Sydney people
ate looking forward to a treat when Miss Nellie
Stewart sings Aug. W. Juncker’s charming song
“I was Dreaming,” which has been so successful
in Melbourne, where it has been encored every
evening during the past six weeks. W. H. Glen
and Co. and Allan and Co. have sold on in
average two hundred copies a day. W. H. Paling
and Co., Ltd., of Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane
and Toowoomba, are doing a big business with
this popular song, also the “ Duchess of York

cardboard carriages to the night-express, the
engine is a furious piece of property with a
realistic funnel which will commend the drama to
crowded audiences. Also, the scenery in general
is worthy of support, and the company do their
work more than creditably, considering that few
among them can have a notion of why they are
doing it. The most tangible character is Polly
Emery, as a slavey who cleans her face with stove-
polish, and doesn’t care whether the leg of mutton
is grilled or fried.
«# * *
The ignorance of local Presbyterians in
condemning theatres has urged Charles Holloway
to a desperate resolve. He will silence bigotry at
one fell blow, it appears, by producing “George
Barnwell,’’ a once popular tragedy taken from the
Newgate Calendar. No Christian sect can cleny
the morality of “ George Barnwell,” for it is the
story of an ardent profligate whose sins bring him
to the gallows. First you see the profligacy ; then
you see the condemned felon, the common hang-
man, the fatal noose, and the parson administering
ghostly comfort. After which the curtain falls
with a sickening thud —thwap! Barnwell being
a solemn warning of only short duration,
appear in conjunction with “ A Dream at Sea ’ on
Saturday (28).
** * *
On the same night B. & B. open a ten*
weeks’ season at the Princess’, with “ The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray.” There was a time, not so long
since, when Melbourne might have looked for-
ward to Pinero’s play with some embarrassment,
but recent shows at the same house have rubbed
the bloom off the city’s innocence, and now it is
fit to study any kind of social question _ with
enthusiasm. “Ma Mie Rosette” is finishing
vigorously. To-night (Thursday) the dresa-ssycle
is reserved for a Tory party from the Australian
Club; to-morrow the farewell demonstration will
take place. The opera company appears in Bris-
bane next week.
** * *
“ Never too Late to Mend,” at Melb,
Alexandra, is another sturdy effort to keep that
airy building before the public eye. Under Dan
Barry’s management the familiar plot is peppered
with surprises, and even diaries Reade might get
many valuable hints from his own narrative if he
could see it now. The chaplain (very effect)vely
played by J. R. Waldron) seems to have lost his
influence over Tom Robinson, for Thomas now
lays his penitence aside in order to pulverise the
prison governor with a lump of granite. The
governor, when last seen, is meeting a tyrant s
dootn in the presence of two warders, who give the
breach of discipline their silent approval. Jacky-
Jacky is brought back to England, in nigger-
minstrel garb, to suit Dora Mostyn, that versatile
actress having appeared an hour before in the pale
wan character of boy Josephs. Also, the Alex-
andra ballet bounders assert themselves in a neat
country dance, and other novelties are thrown in
at popular prices. Dan. Barry, F. C. Appleton,
Dalziel and many others are about the same as
usual, whilst Miss Lilia Wilde is a shade nicer
than ever.
** * *
The best “turn” in the Melb. variety
shows just now is little Alma Gray, who appears
at the Alhambra. This very small child dances
and sings with relish, and seems to have more
brains than precocity.
When Mark Lemon stated that mankind’s
ruling passion was a desire to get orders for the
play he hadn’t been to a Dramatic F6te. An un-
looated bump of wanting to behold actresses and
actors off the boards is really the most potent pro-
tuberance on the human skull. Perhaps this
strange longing is denoted by a dent instead of a
bump—anyway, it exists and is handed down
from generation to generation, like the sins of the
fathers. Bad weather strove considerably to
achieve a failure for the Costume Football Match
and FSte at East Melb. Cricket Ground the other
afternoon, but the populace opened their umbrellas
and carried the elements before them. Every
mummer in Melb. was to be on view, and every-
body at liberty to go forth and get wet took
measures to witness this delirious sight. .£6OO
in admission money was netted by the Dra-
matic Fund to begin with—another .£4OO, or
thereabouts, is understood to have been
netted by ladies within the gates. Prevailing
depression turned itself off at the meter for this
garish occasion. Notable 11 victims ” of the boom
joined their bank-managers in wild attempts to
buy buns at inflated quotations; lawyers and
medicine-men by the score were there, even the
Government analyst had laid aside the odorous
internal organs of the Needle family to snatch a
damp hour among the pros. Sassiety women,
outshone by the superior charms of chorus damsels
and some theatrical ladies, found themselves
treated as unimportant items, whereupon they
agreed that the company was very mixed.
• • •
The attendance was divided into three
great parts. Ist. The shilling crowd |on the far
side of the ground, sans stands, or any places of
shelter except an occasional side-show, where they
could pay what they liked and get no change
back, to see nothing in particular. 2nd. The
comparatively peaceful and God-fearing crowd in
the Grand Stand, trying to persuade themselves
that a tame football match, with donkey-races in-
tervening, formed an amusing entertainment.
3rd. The crowd in the part usually known as the
members’ reserve, attainable by any two-shilling
customer who could work a passage to it, where
the tents of beauty were pitched and the
Club’s own particular pub. stood handy.
The pub,, it appeared, was not being run
for the benefit of aged actors, but in a long room
adjacent a refreshment table was spread, with
Jennie Lee in command. Jennie dispensed
whisky from the bottle at a shilling a “ nip,”|the
“nips” being Jennie-like in their smallness,
though the flavour had a delicious glamour about
it. “Jo” was also in the flower-trade and the
cigarette business, and she sold the privilege of
standing upon a form to look at her, for sixpence
a stand. Meanwhile, Elsie Cameron improved
the shining hour by collecting a basket-full of
silver from members of the E.M.0.0. Club, so
that they might not reproach themselves with
having got in free of charge.
• • •
Outside the members’ stand a mighty mul-
titude struggled to reach the tent of Nellie
Stewart, Florence Young and Ida Osborne. This
was the tent, and the wives and daughters of
Melbourne intended to get there at all hazards.
Some of them did get there, not necessarily
through the orthodox opening, but more probably
through a hole at the side of the tent, or a slit in
the roof. It, perchance, they arrived at the
counter they hung on to it and gazed at
Nellie and Co. without buying a cup of
tea, yet there were battalions of men ready
to lay down their lives for two brief minutes of
bliss among the crockery and cakes. It is a
melancholy fact that “Nellie” didn’t yield her
true value to the fund, owing to the eternal fight
for a glimpse of her. The war was carried on so
promiscuously that nearly everybody got wounded,
although not one in ten of them was ever within
ten yards of “Nellie.” There should have been
a shilling turnstile at the mouth of the tent, to
cool the ardour of prudent lady devotees, and a
policeman to chuck out those who wanted too
much gloat for their money. However, Nellie
must have panned out very well, considering.
• • •
In the early part of the afternoon, before
the Philistines began to push the tent-poles down
from the outside and push them back into position
from the inside, in time to prevent the structure
from burying Nellie beneath its ruins, she sold
many floral tokens and much tea to the young
men, or old men, on terms favourable to the
management. Also, it was a matter of common
knowledge that she had pinned buttonholes in at
five shillings a time, which was reasonable. For
Nellie, in a greeny dress, a bewildering bonnet,
the trickiest of little veils and a holiday smile,
was an exceedingly pleasing person. Violet
Varley and May Pollard, in the next tent,
were visions that came only to him who waits
and walks upon his neighbours, but Flora
Graupner brought sunshine into the surging
throng by coming forth amongst them with a box
of pale, brown cigars. Presumptuous wretches
called her “ Florrie,” and made feeble pretences
of pinching her arm, but Miss G. was getting
shillings for the pale smokes. That was the main
point. Violet Varley even had a bunch of roses
snatched from her dress by the inevitable cad.
Before the indignant little lady could give full
expression to her feelings, Tapley was seen to be
bearing down upon the scene, like the opportune
hero of melodrama, and the lost property was re-
turned. It is at times like these that a husband
exercises an unexpected influence on the course of
events.
* * •
In another tent Dora Mostyn, Lilia Wilde,
and a whole string of familiar footlight faces
sold cups of tea or coffee, or a mixture of both,
with relentless energy, the while that Maud
Williamson went around luring weak mortals on
to boxes of cigarettes. Here, as everywhere, the
beauty of dramatic art was a theme for unstinted
praise. Complexions were delicately adapted to
tent daylight, every eyelid took a graceful curve,
the scheme for capturing the masses was com-
plete. A few soulless creatures stuck strictly to
whisky (whisky from coatless barmen) at the pub.,
but men of finer fibre intoxicated themselves with
cups of temperance mystery and cigars, and
awoke next morning with a swelled—suppose we
say heart.
A CRUEL FETE.
I rushed to that Dramatic Fete—
Not thinking (as you might suppose)
Of mummers in their needy state,
Or burning to relieve their woes ;
I rushed because my heart was set
On something else, you understand.
In point of fact, I meant to get
A cup of tea from NeLLie's hand.
Vain visions of the stilly night !
I’d dreamed of how I gaily went
And found her serving, most polite,
In No. 1 Refreshment Tent.
Methought I gave her such a look
And thrilled her with my masher tricks ;
A cup of tea in dreams I took,
The price of which was twoand-six.
Methought she gazed on me alone,
Reciprocating smirk and smile,
And whispered in a dulcet tone —•
“ Don’t run away just yet awhile.”
And, ere I left—how sweet it seems,
That invite ringing in ray ear !
The Nellie of those foolish dreams,
Said, “ Mind you come again next year.”
• ••***
Heigho ! from three o’clock till five
A cup of tea I strove to win;
The doctor says I’m still alive
Although my ribs are battered in.
My fabric of ambition met
The fate of houses built on sand ;
To tell the truth, I could not get
A distant view of Nellie’s stand.
I heard a johnnie, tall and slim,
Exclaim, “Reserved me!” to a friend—
’Twas not my luck to follow him
And conquer danger in the end.
He reached the goal; his kindling eye
Bore witness to the truth he spoke.
“Put back the Fete, O Lord! ” I cry,
“ And let me be that johnnie bloke.”
But Time is ever on the wing,
And gentle Hope hath power to soothe;
Another year the chance will bring
Of death or glory in a booth.
If Nellie then be o’er the main,
Her chauras by London critics sung,
With Heavdh’s help I will obtain
A cup of tea from Florence Young.
Melb., July 19.
At Poverty Point.
Ethel Hayden means to take Camillo Urso’s advice, and
pay first attention to her voice, which is very pure and
sweet. The little lady’s love lay towards comedy and
drama exclusively, but her friends now confidently look
forward to her appearance among that cluster of operatic
stars in which Vi. Varley and Flo. Graupner shine so
brightly.
Paris is excited about the beautiful legs of El6onore V.,
a dancing-girl at the opera. A rich admirer was so
charmed with these marvellous limbs, that he gained
permission to have them moulded to take to South
America. The lady ordered another dozen pair to sell
to her admirers, and the sculptor made a second dozen,
which he sold to a shopkeeper, who forthwith ticketed
them in his window as “the celebrated legs of El6onore
V., modelled from nature.” Paris rushed to see the
show; the admirer went mad with jealousy, the lady
went mad with rage, and sculptor and shopkeeper are
summoned to give an account of themselves in the law-
courts.
Xmas panto, fixtures: Melb. Royal, “Aladdin”;
Princess’s, “Beauty and the Beast;” Sydney Majesty 8,
“Sinbad.”
Two members of a dramatic co. were “sacked,” the
other day, simply, they aver, because the papers had
spoken too highly of their playing. So much, they
remark, for the magnanimity of stars. Instances are
known, say the players aforesaid, where poor pros, have
actually gone to newspaper-offices and asked the reporters
not to praise their acting for fear of stirring up the star s
bile.
Madame Duse, the Italian tragedienne, sent a shock
through London during her late season at Daly’s Theatre.
The Times cold-shouldered her opening performance
with a short notice, printed in an obscure part of the
organ, and Duse withdrew her advt. Yet Duse still
lives.
Sir ’Gustus Harris has got his new lease of Drury Lane
until Xmas 1901. Holders of the theatre debentures are
forthwith to lose the right of going in “on the nod, a
privilege which dates back to the beginning of the century,
when the original “ renters ” found i'soo apiece towards
the cost of rebuilding the theatre.
The “ millions behind me in this city, my boy,” of th®
intending actor-manager generally resolves itself (remark
The Bulletin’s London correspondent) into the mummer
selling himself body and soul to some insignificant Hebrew
speculator. For instance, Penley’s “ millions behind
him” meant “Charley’s Aunt” being hawked about
until it gotin the hands of a German Jew, Hartmont. Mr.
Lowenthal, who made his pile in a “bucket-shop,
financed “ A Gaiety Girl,” and “The New Boy ” is in the
hands of a Mr. Perryman, who has had varied experiences
in the city as a newspaper proprietor, and as prosecuted
and prosecuting at the Mansion House. He and Harry
Marks, of the Financial News, were alternating as plain-
tiff and defendant for a long time, with scores even and
reputations unimproved. He now, it is said, draws £5OO
a week clear out of “ The New Boy.”_ Perryman is pro-
moting more than one Coolgardie mine, fie is about as
rough as they make ’em, and for “ langwidge ” he is fairly
unapproachable.
Ex-actor Rev. John Reid holds the fort, as pulpitanan,
at the Melb. Unitarian Church. He gets no more orthodox
shows, since he pounded into Evangelical meanness.
Gilbert and Sullivan’s latest rupture arose through
Sullivan declining to supply the music to Gilbert’s last
libretto unless D’Oyly Carte were given the sole right to-
produce in London the 14 pieces of their joint composi-
tion. ...
One result of the exodus of Australian and American
singers to old world centres will be that it will no longer
be necessary for an Anglo-Saxon performer to adopt an
Italian stage-name. Bill Green will not masquerade as
Guglielmo Verdi, and Tom Bent will not be transformed
into Tomaso Bentino.
As was only to be expected, Leumane’s English opera
season collapsed at Adelaide Royal. With one or two
good artists to back up himself and Josephs, Leumane
would have made money.
The Salvation Army in Melb. now sends round what is
billed as a “ Salvation Variety Company,” with “ Char-
acter Sketches,” and “Admission, 3d.”
Every opera-bouffe is a satire on the Ten Command-

George Musgrove only begun to dress a year or two ago.
At the Wednesday theatrical f6te he was the latest Pari-
sian, the only one, and his hat was six weeks ahead of
anything in Melbourne.
The “Unequal Match" was introduced in Melbourne
for the first appearance of Ellen Mortyn, in the last
generation. She made a sensation on the boards, beirtg
regarded as the finest actress that had appeared in Mel-
bourne. Fred. Young, afterwards the original D’Alroy,
of “Caste,” in London, acted Blenkinsop, which Neild
thinks one of the best comic bits he ever saw. Miss Mor-
tyn, who was a grass widow, died in Melbourne under
circumstances which brought a storm of obloquy on a
well-known medico, who was completely exonerated by
the result of the post-mortem. The “ Unequal Match ”
was popularised in London by Amy Sedgwick.
The “ firm ” are rehearsing a new operetta for produc-
tion in Sydney. Nellie Stewart and Wallace Brownlow
will have the show-parts to the exclusion of Mr. and Mrs.
Tapley.
Joe Tapley, W. and M.’s tenor, takes as much interest
in politics as the comic opera. He is a Liberal, with
strong Socialistic bias. His brother, Edward Tapley, is
pretty well-known as a London pamphleteer in the
interests of social economics. He is also related to
Reeves, the publisher.
Nellie Stewart was given a spacious marquee for the acco-
modation of her worshippers at the Melb. mummer
charity fete. Other actress tart-vendors had diminutive
rag-coverings which threatened momentary collapse from
the pressure of admiring johnnies. The result was much
bitter jealousy and sore heartburning on part of latter.
Vivacious Violet Varley, just recovered from two or
three weeks’ illness, goes ’Orae at the beginning of next
year. Before seeking an opening on the London boards
she will polish up her notes under Randegger.
Elsie Cameron and pretty Katherine Hardy were the
conspicuous successes at the private trial of Governor
Robinson’s opera.
Harwood used to be thought a hard bit of wood, not
over genial to his brothers and sisters. At the Thespian
Gala he was surprisingly in evidence, brisk and obliging.
It is gratifying to see that he has so plucked up his
spirits. Somewhat of a fellow feeling had Harwood.
Helping Hands, Melb., are still going their charity
round. Their last shining success was at Prahran, where
they had Dr. O’Hara back again as the Learned Judge in
“Trial by Jury”—the versatile medico’s fine voice.and
evident enjoyment of his part make the play go. The
rain came down in torrents but the house was packed.
Princess (Melb.) closed for a fortnight, for decoration.
Then, Mrs. Brough as Paula Tanqueray.
Singularly enough, the invitations for the private per-
formance of Gov. Robinson’s opera contained the word
“ Music ”in the corner. It recalls Artemus Ward’s in-
timation at the end of a paragraph : “ This is a goak,” or
Sydney Mail’s column headed “ Wit and Humor.”
When Wallace Brownlow took up his position iu the
field at the theatrical football match the band played
“ He is a Gallant Man ; " and the new baritone further
impressed the assemblage by having a lackey following
him round the ground with a change of boots. ’Twas not
Ryley’s style, but ’twill do, presumably.
“ Bob ” Brough has just celebrated his 38th birthday.
Talmage will not be popular with the clergy of Sydney.
They affect to be mightily displeased at his being “ run ”
by a manager as though he were a theatrical star—which
he is-and they don’t like paying for admission. They
would prefer a collection.

Ohxef Justice Darley was the only Supreme
Court Judge who showed up at the Carnot requiem
in Sydney Cathedral.
Camilla Urso’s stamp-collection is the
envy of philatelists. It occupies almost as much
of her time as violin-playing.
Governor holding a Cabinet Council, with
his head full of opera-bouffe. “Let’s see, water-
supply of Coolgardie—lum-tum-tum-tum—what’s
that air again ?”
Alfred Deakin will be 38 on Friday,
August 3. “It was August the third and quite
soft were the skies, but ’t must not be inferred
that Alf. D. was likewise.”
N.S. W. Attorney-General Heydonattended
the Carnot requiem at Sydney in a full-bottomed
wig. As he went down the steps to his carriage,
an old Irishwoman in the crowd asked a police-
man if that was Sur Hennery Parkes.
Justice Harding, alias “ Bruin,” who
would have been Q. Chief Justice but that “Our
Sam ” had to be provided for, completed his statu-
tory term of office on 15th inst. He can now
legally claim a pension of .£1333 per annum.
Possibly the wealthiest vote recorded in
favour of any Labour candidate in N.S.W. elec-
tions was that of the lucky young musician
of the Glebe, who recently came in for <£160,000.
Riches, so far, have not changed his politics.
A Southern Government hungrily follows
the health of a certain millionaire, who has nearly
shuffled off several times, but is now looking really
well. He would cut up at about a million and a-
half, and bring in some =£Bo,ooo probate duty.
A while ago the Bishop of Ballarat had to
elect a canon, and among the candidates was a
Rev. Ball, of Avoca. The Bishop disposed of
this aspirant by ti lling him that a Canon Ball
would be too suggestive of worldly strife. Ha, ha!
H. J. Moseley, builder, of Magill
(Adelaide, S.A.), who died on July 6, aged 75
years, was one of the small band of pioneers who,
in ’36, assembled under “the historic gum-tree”
at Glenelg to hear read the proclamation of the
province.
Apropos “the Australian Rousseau,” &c,,
Jerome K. Jerome now presents Guy Boothby,
“ the intrepid Australian explorer,” as “ the Aus-
tralian Kipling ! ” What price Fergus Hume
“ the Australian Dickens,” or Bill Holloway “the
Australian Irving?”
London papers state that the rumour of
Duke Marlborough’s engagement to the daughter
of Mount Morgan D’Arcy had more in it than
previous rumours of the young man’s matrimonial
intentions. The idea is that Miss D’A. will
“catch him by-and-bye.”
Rev. F. Hastings, who has gained some
scribbling notoriety in connection with Rue Aus-
tralia, has been favoured with a “call” to the
new Parkside (Adelaide, S.A.) Congregational
Church. If the rev. gentleman properly wrestles
in prayer, he will probably discover that it is not
a genuine “ call from the Loard,” as the “church,”
though large enough to swing one cat in, could
hardly accommodate the swinging of two cats at a
time.
A rascally S.A.
Labour-member
named Price objects
to the proposed gift
of a complete set of
S.A. stamps to the
Duke of York. “If
these fellows with
big incomes want
things of this sort,”
he says, “ they should
pay for them as any-
one else would have
to do.”
In the early days
of his Parliamentary
career, the present
Maoriland Premier,
Seddon, was styled,
and acted up to the
name of, “Silent
Dick.” A Govt., bill
was opposed by a
small party of stone-
wallers, and each of
the latter was told off
to talk for a four
hours’ shift. When
Seddon’s turn came
it was a matter of
much speculation
whether he would be
able to talk for the
required time. But
he rose to the occa-
sion. “Mr. Speaker,”
said he, “ if this Bill
becomes law it will
affect the electors
most materially. I
beg leave to read the
names of my consti-
tuents whom this Bill
will peculiarly affect. ”
Drawing an electoral
roll from his pocket
he began to read the
electors’ names in ro-
tation, making a com-
ment on each. He
hadn’t half finished
the list at the call of
time.
The new York bantling is called Edward
(after its father) Albert (grandfather) Christian
(Protestant succession) George Andrew Patrick
David (tribute to each of the countries which are
to earn its living). Such ingenuity must strain
the Court intelligence to its utmost limits.
Preacher B. Rodda said, at the Melb.
celebration of the “ immortal battle of the
Boyne,” that the present Dean of Melb.’s grand-
father rode into Dublin with the very first news
of the result of the battle, yelling that King
William “ would come to the city as soon as he
could.”
The most important objection to the
appointment of “ Ranker ” Parkinson to succeed
Vic. Police Chief Coraissioner Chomley, is that
he is a prominent and uncompromising Orange-
man. _ A chief of police should be, above all func-
tionaries, a man of no sectarian colour whatever.
Gov. Duff said that when the N.S.W.
Masons heard the name of the new pro-grand-
master (Speaker Abbott) they would be
greatly pleased. _ The Governor, however,
didn’t say anything about the late pro-grand-
master, whose whereabouts are now a matter of
much speculation.
Parkes’ reply to certain school-girls, who (at
the instance of some toady or other) gave him an
address, wished that each of them might be “a
dutiful daughter, a true friend, and a pure-
hearted Australian—ugh !—lady.” Parkes has
never been able to realise the dignity of woman,
and never will. His intellect crawls instinctively.
The departing Bishop of Adelaide, now
promoted to the .£5OOO a year billet of “ Bath and
Wells,” is one of the lucky lambs. During his
sojourn in South Australia, his little investments
have been guided from Above, and he goes
“Horae” a capitalist. Dowagers addicted to
taking the Bath waters will find much comfort in
this “dear creature from the colonies.”
Daring N.S.W. general election several
publications were stopped at the 6.P.0. because
they had not been registered at the Supreme
Court. While going through the required form,
the proprietor and editor of one, asked by the
Judge whether he held property worth <£3oo
within the province, replied : “ Three hundred
pounds ! Why, I have a poem here in my pocket,
your Honor, that’s worth three thousand, to say
nothing of the undying fame and divine afflatus.”
Arthur Griffith, the newly-elected Labour
M.P. for Waratah, N.S.W., who has had his por-
trait taken in a very pretty military uniform—on
his own showing, is the nephew of one baronet, the
close relation of another [W. A. Governor Robin-
son], and kinsman of several other unspecified
nabobs. _ And Labour-member Sehey says that he
(Schey) is a lineal descendant of Admiral Drake.
If the N.S.W. Labour-party goes on accumulat-
ing “ blue blood ” in this extravagant way it will
soon become the party—from the ladies’ gallery
point of view.
When Peacock was Yic. Education Minister
he was accosted in a hotel by one of his own
officers who calmly asked him for the loan of £2.
He didn’t get it, but about a week afterwards he
was hauled before the Minister to explain why hs
had not paid his tailor. “Look here,” said
Peacock, “ you really ought to know better. Why,
how do you think I’d get on if I went trying to
borrow money from people as you do? ” “ Oh,”
replied Blank, airily, “that’s quite a different
thing—you’re here to-day and gone to-morrow,
but I’m here to stay.” Six months afterwards
they had both gone.
To The Bulletin’s way of thinking, the
most complimentary obituary notice of the accom-
plished Dr. Pearson was that written by some
blatant snob in Pall Mall Budget, wherein it is
said that “he would not have received a single
white ball had he put up for Melbourne Club, the
haunt of all the most respected men in the pro-
vince, especially the Oxford and Cambridge bred.”
Doctor Pearson, to his eternal credit, never dis-

graced himself to such abject depths as to desire
membership of this centre of all that is meanest,
most grovelling, moat profligate, and most howl-
lngly caddish in Melbourne life.
Cardinal Moran’s boast that no one is able

t° fc ®n whether he is a Freetrader or a Protectionist
( s quite on a level as regards proof of moral in-
telligence with the boast of a certain N.S.W.
politician that no one can tell what his religion is.
The Cardinal does not say that he does not know
which he thmks right; only that he does not let
anybody know how he thinks on the matter. It
ouia.be hard for churchman Moran to prove
politician Disraeli a moral shambler when the
latter said that a wise man never lets anybody
know his religion ; t.e., it would be hard if at the
same time he had to prove his own conduct intel-
leetually courageous.

labelled him :
I AM VERY FIT.
I have to speak at Blanktown. If too far gone,
pour bucket of water on my head".
The commercials left ere Blanktown was reached,
and the statesman landed with his braces round
hi- n ek, his belltopper bashed in, and a temper-
ance badge affixed to his coat.
A side-light on N.S. W. general election
is that “ Mick ” Kinnane, the bookmaker whose
candidature clinched the defeat of ex-Attorney-
General Barton, is brother-in-law of Crick, M.P.
The first, and incomplete, returns of the
N.S.W. elections made two distinct impressions
upon the Melbourne morning journals. The
Argus said: “Freetrade Victory Foreshadowed,”
and the Age said; “ Protectionist Gains Ex-
pected.”
One of the surprises of N.S.W. general
election was the rejection of “Dismal Jemmy”
Garvan, of “ sacred and solemn duty ” celebrity,
in favour of solicitor Rawlinson, also a protec-
tionist. Mr. Garvan will now have plenty of time
to look after his celebrated insurance co.
It is unlikely that the proposal to estab-
lish in S.A. labour-colonies “on the German
system ” will be adopted. “ The German labour-
colonies are nothing better than penal settlements,
where the labourer receives a pint of skilly and
3oz. black bread for breakfast, hotch-potch for
dinner, and skilly and black bread for tea, and
works ten hours a day.”
E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P. (N.S.W.), is
weathercocking with the latest political breezes,
and jumping upon Premier Dibbs, his late chief,
now that the latter is down. “So far as lam
concerned, I will not give a vote which may
merely have the effect of keeping George Dibbs
dangling in office after the country has given its
verdict against him.” Again— “It is impossible
to tell what Dibbs will do—he is too much like a
jack-jumper cracker. You’ve only to apply a
light and he jumps about in a most eccentric
fashion.”
The Age on millionaire W. J. Clarke’s
announcement of his intention to abandon his wild
political career in the Vic. Upper House is
Particularly nauseous. The announcement has
ertated “profound regret” in the Southern pro-
vince. “It is generally admitted that his posi-
tion as a large land-owner who has always
endeavoured to repress class animosities entitles
him to a seat in the Upper House, where his
presence is of advantage to the whole province as
a representative of the landed and banking
interests, keeping them in touch with democratic
influences,” etc., etc. So, Clarke it is who keeps
the landed and banking interests in touch with
democracy! That they have “touched” the
democracy is a thing which nobody can deny.
But this is hardly a sufficient reason why the
relapse of the “bart.” who goes into Parliament
on his pocket should be profoundly regretted,
Clarke has certainly endeavoured to repress class
animosities—by helping to choke off the smaller
dog. Intellectually this particular bank Clarke
is a little below the average of his order.
Willard, who put down B. B. Nicoll,
N.S.W. president of the A.N.A., and was elected
f or Tweed, is not likely to hold his seat as he
had only been 4J months in the province when
nominated. The law requires 12 months residence
and three months in one electorate,
In no place is the Caucasian so nearly

According to the Lon-
don correspondent of the
Advertiser (Adelaide) the
once-bright Randolph
Churchill is showing symp-
toms of general paralysis,
the complaint of which J.
C. Bray died. Paralysis of
the tongue has already set
in, and everyone but the
sufferer himself notices
that his words are becom-
ing incomprehensible. He
still imagines that he is a
platform orator, however.
Sala’s Journal is
dead. It was to be an
“(ideal family journal,”
and too much family killed
it. People got tired of
hearing from Mrs. S. how
imposing Mr. S. looked
while he was writing arti-
cles, and from Mr. S. what
a treasure of a gossip Mrs.
S. was. Also, the older
Sala gets, the larger grows
the proportion of hogwash
in his writing; and even
the stupid English public
has begun to see this.
A Soudan warrior who,
on his return from goat-
slaying in Africa, joined
the Sydney police, while
drunk one night met a
<juiet-looking citizen whom,
in his anxiety for official
distinction, he arrested for
being drunk and disor-
derly. The citizen went
quietly to the lock-up and
was placed in the cage to
be searched; and then a
couple of constables caught
the warrior and threw him
into a cell. That zealous
policeman had run in his
own inspector!
Joe Sym.es has recon-
sidered his relations to
God, who is henceforth to

This is a sad backsliding.
The Victorian “Prime Minister” abuses
the papers for their one-sidedness. “Is it not
true,” he asks, “that you know when you take
up a paper just what it is going to say ?” This is
sublime gall from the baled and branded Imperial
barracker and Tory tout.
The Age ridicules the barbarisms of
Corea : “Any subject touched by the king’s hand
has to wear a brass plate for ever to commemorate
the fact.” What of it? He is only like many
representative” Australians who get “ touched, ’
and become O.M.G.’s for ever after. J. Brown
Patterson is only a bull-dog with a brass collar.
Painful Days
Will arrive for all those who are predisposed to
rheumatism or rheumatic gout during the winter
months, being the time of the year when these
diseases develope with renewed violence. To
avoid a great deal of suffering, it is advisable to
take precautionary measures in time, and to use
remedies that will not only prevent these attacks,
but effectually and permanently eradicate these
evils from the system. Rheumatism and rheu-
matic gout can only be cured by a constitutional
treatment, and a remedy which prevents the
accumulation of uric aeid in the blood, and which
will remove this acid if already formed, restoring
the digestive kidneys to a normal and healthy
action. Embrocations, plasters, ointments, and
other local applications may sometimes afford
temporary relief from acute pain, but never remove
thedisease. It is generally considered that War-
ner’s Safe Cure is the only remedy which effectu-
ally and permanently cures these complaints, and
there is scarcely a town, village, or hamlet in
Australasia in which some person does not pro-
claim its efficacy. The following ease forcibly
illustrates these pointsJunee, New South
Wales, May 16th, 1894. Messrs. H. H. Warner
& 00, : Rheumatism has proved a great drawback
to me in my trade as a carpenter, especially when
climbing ladders and working on high buildings.
As a consequence, I have been compelled to de-
cline many offers of good work. The pains would
suddenly seize my frame when in elevated posi-
tions, so that I had narrow escapes from serious
accident or, perhaps, death. The paroxysms
would sometimes effect my limbs and at other
times the back, so that I must have repeatedly
fallen had there been nothing to lay hold upon for
support. I have been frequently prescribed for
by doctors, and when their treatment failed have
tried supposed remedies, but none of these means
were of a,ny benefit for any length of time. It was
not until I took your Safe Medicines that I
experienced any decided improvement. Their
good effects became so pronounced that when I
had taken 9 bottles of Safe Cure and 3 of Safe
Rheumatic Cure I found myself entirely cured.
Three years have passed without any attack, so
that I have good reason to conclude that the cure
is perfect.—C. F. Riley, Carpenter and Joiner.”

POLITICAL POINTS
Parkes when he gets into office “shortly,

vator of N.S.W. Forests.
jVPLellan, in Vic. Assembly: “Will the
fallen women have votes?” Trenwxth : the

In Kino 1 Parliamentary division, Sydney,
William Edward John M‘Guire last week polled
four votes—one for each of his names.
Parkes says he has received more votes of
confidence than any other Australian politician.
The Great Australian Confidence-Man !
The duel for the N.S.W. leadership—
Parkes and longevity on the one side ; Reid and
obesity on the other. An awkward position for
expectant followers.
In the spacious electorate of the Burke,
O there is neither church, chapel, priest, nor
parson. To this fact Labour-leader Glassey
ascribes “the manliness and honesty of his con-
stituents.”
At J. P. Abbott’s election to the N.S.W.
Speakership, Parkes said he had no hope of ever
aiding in the election of another Speaker. What
is now the meaning of certain rumours about
J. H. Young?
The N.S.W. teetotallers are looking blue
over the result of the elections. About 23 prohi-
bitionists—several of them of the most rabid type
—have been dropped into their native obscurity
by the voters.
When Dr. Maloney introduced his
Women’s Franchise Bill, in Vic. Assembly, on
Thursday, there was not a single woman present
in the House, and throughout the debate only one
woman turned up.
Jawbone Neild’s unexpectedly heavy de-
feat at Woollahra at the hands of Adrian Knox
serves chiefly to accentuate the fact that no “ real
gentleman” ever concerned himself about his
neighbour’s religion.
Out of seven parsons who tried to enter
N.S.W. Parliament at the recent election, only
one succeeded. Hallelujah ! The parson isn’t in
demand as a politician—in fact, he isn’t much in
demand as anything.
The defeat of Toby Barton at Randwick
has somewhat upset Parkes’ schemes. He relied
on Barton to help him in squelching Reid, and in
dishing Reid’s Freetrade following by a Freetec-
tion-Federation coalition.
Kingsbury’s Dalby slap in the face to MTI-
- is the first result of a sharp answer to his
piteous question : “ Ain’t the Government agoin’
ter do anything for me—after my speeches got
Mae. in for North Brisbane?”
Education Minister Suttor’s rejection at
Bathurst involves no more loss to N.S.W. Assem-
bly than the election of Sydney Smith, his sup-
planter, involves gain. Mr. Suttor consists merely
of a gentlemanly moustache; Mr. Smith is the tip-
joint of Parkes’ tail.
A Southern Government is said to have
forwarded all the way from Brisbane to Rock-
hampton, for use in a Government department, a
package of lampwicks and a pound of tallow-
candles tied to a broom. This is one of the
reasons for C.Q. Separation.
Hawaii is formally proclaimed a republic,
with Dole, leader of the Yankee faction, as first
President. Luckless Liliuokalani has fought hard
against the change, but the result would have
been just the same had she been Queen of Heaven
instead of Queen of Hawaii.
The elect of the National Ass for one of
the Newtown (Sydney) electorates proclaimed on
every possible occasion during the campaign that
he gave the whole of his Parliamentary salary to
charity in his electorate. If this isn’t bribery,
pare and simple, then it ought to be.
The cardinal difference which runs right
through the careers of Parkes and Reid, and
which must naturally separate them on all
occasions when new political principles come up
for treatment, is, that Reid considers that Parlia-
ment forms public opinion, whereas Parkes holds
that it merely expresses it.
The election of Glassey to the leadership
of the Q. Parliamentary Labour-party is a signifi-
cant event. The Labour Federation aspired to
dominate the Radical political movement, and
M itt. Reid was their nominee, but the party
desired a broader base than the unions alone, and
chose Glassey by a large majority.
That slippery politician, Archer, member
for Rockhampton (C.Q.), called a meeting of his
constituents recently, and got a vote of want of
confidence by 700 to 50. Archer merely smiled
and snapped his fingers; he would only resign
when asked to do so by his committee. Another
version of “ The public be damned !’’
B. R. Wise says his first obligation is to
Parkes. True; Stnike’s first obligation is to
Squeers.
The latest from Hingland is Westminster
Gazette’s opinion that “ It is satisfactory to find
that the electors of N.S.W. have visited the sins
of Premier Dibbs by the withdrawal of a large
measure of support.” The inwardness of this
pronouncement : that the Westminster Gazette
editor is B. R. Wise’s brother-in-law.
Dr. Garrett, of Parramatta, a candidate at
N.S.W. election, announced that in answer to
two deputations that had waited upon him and in
response to the voice of the people he had decided
to submit himself at the poll. He got exactly
two votes, which couldn’t both have been his own.
“Happy the man who can say he has one friend !’
Payment of members at present rates
makes Parliament the happy hunting grounds
either of the very rich or the very poor. The
ordinary individual with a business or a profession
to attend to, or a decent billet to be jeopardised,
cannot afford to enter politics at the .£2OO paid ip
S. A., or even at the higher rates given in N.S.W.
and Vic.
The Queensland Treasurer plumes himself
on the fact that his revenue is only .£BOOO short
this year. He neglects, however, to point out
that his apparently solvent condition is due to the
fact that the Government has carried out forced
sales of lands (principally Central) to the tune of
,£50,000. He has simply paid his financial tucker-
bill by pawning his financial shirt.
During the debate on the Credit Foncier
Bill the Tories of the Vie. Assembly constantly
drew attention to the fact that selectors’ instal-
ments were £600,000 in arrear, which proved that
the average selector was a very bad person for the
State to lend money to. And no one had con-
science enough to point out that the genuine
selector pays up better than any other Govern-
ment debtor, and that almost the whole of the
£600,000 is owned by big land-grabbers, and by
financial institutions mostly run by M.’sP.— in
other words, that the people who complained
about the £600,000 owing to the Government were
themselves the persons who owe it, and who can t
be made to pay lest they should throw the Ministry
out there and then.
The new Maoriland
Legislature is said to be,
in the aggregate, younger,
rather better - looking,
and much better-dressed
than its predecessor.
This is obviously one of
the first results of female
suffrage. The old Legis-
lature was an elderly,
slovenly and hard-faced
congregation, and about
as different from its suc-
cessor as a bull - dog is
from a bird of Paradise.
At the opening of
Maoriland Parliament,
the other day, the Gover-
nor turned up by mistake
at the wrong door, while
the Ministers stood wait-
ing to receive him at the
other. His Ex. got in-
side, and finding no one
on hand to greet him he
pulled up and remained
absolutely motionless.
Being invited by some
unauthorised person to
come right in, he replied
sternly that the Ministry
should have been there to
receive him, and unless
he was officially con-
ducted by the proper
authorities he wasn’t sup-
posed to know his way
in. Then he reassumed
his frozen attitude until
the Cabinet arrived in
hot haste and pointed out
to him that all he needed
to do was to walk straight
ahead, whereupon he
condescended to walk
straight ahead and even-
tually arrived. It is little
things like these which
make up the dignity of
the blessed Crown and
Constitution.
Indecent haste, at the least, characterised
Maoriland Parliament in rejecting with levity and
ribaldry—as press reports indicate—a motion in
favour of allowing women seats in the House and
immediately proceeding to discuss newly-proposed
facilities for obtaining divorce. The Bulletin
prays that there may be male and female M. sP.
in its time. It wants to have some real fun before
it dies.
The most strongly Foreign-trade consti-
tuency in N.S. Wales is evidently Sherbrooke,
where Foreign-trade scored 1049 votes and Pro-
tection just 18 in all. Sherbrooke is a fruit-
growing district, and the fruit-growers, being pro-
tected tea great extent against foreign compete
tion by the perishable nature of their staple,
don’t care whether the rest of the country is ruined
by cheap-labour competition or not.
Queensland M.L.A.-Kingsbury’s political
coat will be handv when rainbows get scarce. He
has a “ law-’n-order ” garment for meetings of the
Q.N.8., a pure merino covering for thePastoralists’
Association, a Monte Carlo stripe for creditors of
the reconstructed Deposit Bank, a ‘ come into my
parlour ” integument for the Equitable Building
Society, a Democratic thatch for the farmers, and
a labour homespun for meetings of the horny-
handed.
It is a woeful thing to go prophesying
before the event. Almost every paper in Sydney
not only declared in advance that its party must
win, but proved it by absolutely indisputable
evidence. The result shows that the average
prophet is the worst shot in all Australia. Ihe
only paper which didn’t get more or less left was
The Bulletin, which contented itself by stating
that anything might happen. And that is just
what did happen.
Wise. M.P., after the N.S.W. elections:
“I am individually bound to Parkes by feelings
of personal friendship and party loyalty. But, if
he should not be our leader, there is no one with
whom I could work so easily as Mr. R®JP•.
Apropos tiie story of a French officer of the Civic
Guard, presented by his followers with a sword.
“Comrades,” he said, holding aloft the flashing
weapon, “ I accept this sword, and will use it for
two purposes —to defend the institutions of my
native country; or —to fight against them if
necessary.”
Interesting question for N.S.W. : Can a
firmly-prinoipled foreign-trade Government logi-
cally continue the Chinese poll-tax? If so, why
so? If not, where does principle begin and where
does it end in the freetrade mind ? Correlative
questions : Should a freetrade Government be less
influenced by national expediency than a protec-
tionist Government? If so, why so? H not,
is there any such administration on this planet as
freetrade Government?

The United States revised tariff bill, after
being pared down until it is almost as strongly
Protectionist as the old M‘Kinley Act, has struck
a final snag somewhere, and there are rumours
by the cable that it may be abandoned altogether.
Considering that the Democrats —whom the Aus-
tralian shoddy press insists on calling the Free-
trade party—have a strong majority in both
Houses, the situation is unaccountable, unless the
Democrats are really Protectionists, just like the
Republicans.
In the Bundaberg (Q.) district alone there
died over 300 Kanakas (out of a sum total of
about 4500) in the last year. In the Bundaberg
district also there have been more respectable
little fortunes amassed in the last 10 years than in
any other district in Queensland. In the Bunda-
berg district also white labour is in a state of un-
speakable degradation, and the planter is begin-
ing to talk of his hands (European) _as white
“boys.” From which little facts the intelligent
reader will draw his own conclusions.

Dear Bulletin, —Please note also that

If Maoriland, the least Catholic province, is the
■“ most prohibitionist,” it is also the most radical,
and S. Australia, “next most prohibitionist,”
comes also next in legislation for the people.
Queensland, on the other hand, is “least prohibi-
tionist,” most Catholic, and most monopolist,
while N. S. Wales and Westralia again come
next. In my political experience, I have always
found the Irish-Australian the loudest to shriek
and the easiest to nobble. Immigrants from the
sister islands are more slowly moved to reform,
and more steadfast as reformers. Their patriot-
ism has a smaller flame, but a higher price.—

Thus Toby Barton, Q. 0., on his defeat for
Randwick : —“I have fought the battle of im-
mortal truth, and when the historian comes to
write the scroll of the victories in Australia’s
cause, he will not find on it the name of any other
candidate to-day, but there will be boldly inscribed
upon it the name of Edmund Barton.” This is
true enough, but then perhaps Barton himself
shouldn’t hate said it. The brainy, lazy ex-
Sneaker will be much missed from a Legislature
which contains no man who is his intellectual
equal, and which, moreover, now that Barton is
gone, contains no man who really knows anything
about the Federation question. However, Rand-
wick will, no doubt, be satisfied. It is now repre-
sented by a gentleman who sells socks and washes
his hands in invisible soap —and is sound on the
great principle of Freetrade, as it is understood by
the Calico party.

Brisbane Courier, on the N.S.W. poli-
tical situation: —
That poor afflicted country will find that it has gained
King Stork for King Log. Should the party be strong
enough it will impose direct taxation, and especially a
land-tax. The present state of commercial affairs is the
most unfit that can well be conceived for such a ruthless
change.
The humour of this enunciation lies in the fact
that the present editor of the Brisbane Courier is
F. W. Ward, formerly editor of the land-taxing
Sydney Daily Telegraph. Whup !
Since Griffith was paid £3500 a year to
clear out of politics he has dropped into compara-
tive obscurity. A recent article in an American
magazine shows him shilly-shallying in the same
old fashion with regard to black labour. Probably,
had he remained in power he would be ready to
prohibit it again by this time. It was Queens-
land’s misfortune that his mind happened to be
made up in the wrong direction just before he left
office. If he had only waited to change it once
more he might never have earned the curse of
next century’s democracy.
Ninian Melville, undertaker, and long
Chairman of Committees in N.S.W. Assembly,
has been banished from Parliament by the
Waratah miners whom he so long and, in the main,
satisfactorily represented; for few Democratic poli-
ticians have worn much better than Melville. His
victorious opponent is Arthur Griffith, lately a
master at Sydney Grammar School. The Bulletin
has regarded Melville’s political extinction as irn-
pendiugever since it saw him wearingopossum-skin
cuffs on his overcoat. That wondrous garment
made the miners believe that Ninian also bad
opossum-skin cuffs on his mind.
The celebrated N.S.W. Labour Electoral
“pledge” has much to answer for. The pledge-
clique lost Leichhardt to the Labour-party by
running Holman against the old Labour-member,
Clark, the seat going, as here predicted, to the
National Ass nominee, Hawthorne. By running
Watson against Traill for South Sydney they
ensured the return of another National Ass
nominee, Whiddon. Then, by running Rosa (who
couldn’t legally have sat had he been elected)
against M‘Donnell they opened the door
to Nick Willis. By running Soutar against that
consistent democrat, Hutchison, they insured the
return of Frank Wright. In fact, quite 40 per
cent, of the seats were lost to the Democratic
party through the intolerant domination of a
maladroit and noisy little Sydney clique.
J. J. Kingsbury, who entered Q. Parlia-
ment for North Brisbane at last election, helping
MTlwraith to defeat Lilley and Glassey, has
broken out as the most surprising kind of a Demo-
crat. In a recent speech at Dalby he advocated
the abolition of party government, the Referen-
dum, an elective Upper House, woman suffrage,
banking reform, one young man one vote, and one
old man two votes —besides speaking loudly for
State assistance to farmers, mining on private
property, and a whole host of things abhorred by
the Banks who backed him into Parliament.
Kingsbury is a smart platform-speaker, and a
highly unreliable politician. Apparently he has
made up his mind that MTlwraith is done, and is
going for the Democratic vote. The people love
to be gulled ; but isn’t it rather soon after North
Brisbane?
Australia'sarch slang-whanger, the doughty
John M'Elhone, who at N.S.W. general election
was easily defeated for Fitzroy (Sydney) by one
Chapman, has in the hour of his ignominy The
Bulletin's sincerest sympathy. For Chapman is
but a squeaky-voiced and doubly-dyed alderman,
utterly devoid of individuality, and nothing more
than a splinter off the world’s great grocer-log.
He has long been making friends grocerially with
the Woolloomooloo electors, and polled 6G6, which
is the Number of the Beast. What a spoilt career
is that of M'Elhone, and what splendid poten-
tialities there were in the man ! What a forceful,
eloquent, clear-brained, sardonic advocate he could
have been made had he been caught young ! With
his business ability, inherent honesty of purpose
and hatred of wrong, what a political leader might
have been fashioned out of this coarse-tongued
tallow-dealer! When some years ago a well-
known French sculptor was in Sydney, he one
day saw M‘Elhone with his hat off in the Parlia-
mentary vestibule. “Who is that man?” he
exclaimed —“he has the head of Julius Caesar !”
People will smile, for they never associate Julius
Caesar with three days’ growth of jaw-stubble and
a clay-pipe nosewarmer; but the marvellous re
semblance is there all right enough.
THE TWO
GENUINE ARTICLES:
CLEMENTS TONIC, ?
FLETCHER’S PILLS,
IMITATED!
BUT UNRIVALLED
AND UNEQUALLED.
CLEMENTS TONIC is a scientific chemical
food and restores the tissue wasted by the voca-
tions of everyday life, is a prompt and safe
remedy for neuralgia, nervousness, weakness,
debility, liver complaint, dropsy, and chronic
indigestion.
FLETCHER'S PILLS cure heartburn, back
ache, headache, liver torpidity, dyspepsia and all
complaints of the stomach and bowels.
These two remedies have been thoroughly tested
in all the hot countries of the world. They are
sold at a price within the reach of all people.
Evidence is forwarded free on receipt of name and
address that will satisfy the most sceptical as to
their virtues. They are sold everywhere, but
care must be taken that the genuine are obtained
or the money and time are wasted and the disease
so much the more serious.

Dear Bulletin, Since
continence —literal and abso-
lute—would bring a nation to
a speedier end than even the
wildest immorality, the “moral
tone, ” beloved of “ Tam Col-
lins ” must predicate a certain
amount of sexuality. Ihe
question is simply one of de-
gree, and has been imtne-
morially confused by the
assumption that morality of
“tone” means morality of
practice. A married man,
without overstepping theolo-
gical or conventional morality,
may be physiologically more
immoral than a man whose
amours are minus the social
imprimatur. And the latter,
or a nation of him, would sur-
vive the former, or a nation
of himl— Blunderbore.

The missing Victorian Parliamentary mace,
as now appears, was not smuggled away to a
bagnio in Melbourne city, but to the suburban
branch establishment of that prosperous institu-
tion. There it was utilised in an allegorical open-
ing of Parliament by a procession of joyous
nymphs attired in undress uniform, the male
guests of the evening bringing up the rear. The
festival unhappily was cut short by a telephone
message summoning the mace-bearers to town.
Then came those disgraceful paragraphs in the

dropped into the sea of silence. One of these days

The latest Social Purity item comes from
London. According to the cable-gentleman, it
has been discovered that the run on massage, the
favourite modern remedy for all manner of com-
plaints, is largely owing to the fact that the mas-
sage houses are used for purposes of fashionable
immorality. “Many flagrant society women,”
says the blushing and embarrassed cable, “ are in
the habit of visiting them.” Therefore Home
Secretary Asquith proposes to investigate the
massage question, and to put down the evil, if
necessary, with a strong hand. When he is at
it he might as well fix his shocked eye on
Turkish baths, which could also stand a lot of
hard inspection. After he has inspected them
both thoroughly he will probably come to the con-
clusion that the only way to run them on a moral
basis is to make them a State department, and let
every customer be massaged under the strict
supervision of the police and the Social Purity
Society, assisted by delegates from all the
churches, with Stead, of the Review of Reviews,
as chief Turkish-bath attendant and Antoinette
Sterling as head masseuse. And even then the
results are not as certain as they might be.
Apropos of these and other things : About ten
years ago, in a certain Australasian city, a son of
Belial, who owned a small shop adjacent to the
Turkish baths, discovered a means whereby he
could look into the apartment where the patients
were scrubbed down by the attendant, and on
ladies’ days he used to hire out that chink
to wicked, old, fat citizens at pounds an
hour. The only drawback to this lucrative busi-
ness was the difficulty he experienced in getting
the customer to let go when his hour or his
half-hour was up. Often a stout, elderly
gentleman would have to be torn away from
the orifice almost by violence, and there was always
a danger that the scuffle would attract attention
and give the business away. At last the matter
reached the ears of the landlord, and he promptly
ejected the tenant, and took over the connection
himself, and then the tenant secretly informed a
detective, and the detective blackmailed the land-
lord, and there was much trouble. How the
business ended The Bulletin doesn’t remember,
but it has a vague recollection that it wound up
somehow in a free fight, in the course of which one
respectable old inhabitant was considerably bruised
and battered.

There seems to be no reason why

original contract is fulfilled.
However, the European post offices will re-address
a traveller’s letters without charge as often as

SWAGGIES PASSING THROUGH.
I have the picture in my eye
Though seven years have passed
The grey-green boughs, the bright-blue sky,
The river swirling fast.
The laughing children still I see,
I've faded from their view ;
For simply they regarded me
A swaggy passing through.
And ’tis the same when life we quit,
We have our pain and fun:
We loaf, we laugh, we love a bit,
And then our tally’s done ;
And though the world with hate galore
Or love intense we view.
It little cares—we’re nothing more
Than swaggies passing through.

TELEPATHY!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We know we love—though ruthless Fate
With flaming sword bars Eden’s gate,
And knowledge sweet has come so late
We know we love.
Eyes smile to eyes, and, shining clear,
Love melts the mists of Doubt and Fear ;
Seas may divide—apart yet near
Eyes smile to eyes.
Heart beats with heart—nor Time nor Space
Hath pow’r to loosen the embrace.
In slumberland—the try sting place—
Heart beats with heart.
Soul speaks to soul—two visions bright
Irradiant with no earthly light.
Sweet the commune in silent night!
Soul speaks to soul.
Our secret keep. The voice that saith,
“ We love,” is not the night-wind’s breath.
Divine, ’twill triumph over Death —
Our secret keep.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHA.T IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily Hie art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad Aide for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you? Will you do your business at

How to Get a Piano or Organ.
■\TOU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
J- touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you must have durability. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, for which there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe—that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other first-
class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate
OUR LARGE ‘ AND VARIED STOCK OP

high time somebody should see that persons ac
cused of murder get something like a fair show
for their lives. In recent cases, Government has
secured the best available talent for the prosecu-
tion, and left the accused at the mercy of some
sucking junior. It cannot be too strongly urged
that the first object of a criminal trial should be
to ascertain the truth, and nob to secure the/

A “Prevention of Cruelty to Animals”
Society dame down South put her foot in it over

opportunity during a call at Govt. House, she
bustled up to Gov. Hopetoun with : “ We know
how Lady Hopetoun is—everybody asks after her.
Tell me how is the horse, the poor, poor horse?
Is he getting well looked after?” John Adrian

Dr. Wolfe has instituted an Opthalmo-
logical Clinic (elastic word) at his professional
residence in Collins-street, Melbourne, for the
advancement of the good cause of eye-doctoring.
A clinic is seemingly a place where the specialist
diffuses knowledge among the brethren gratis and
charges nothing to patients who can’t afford to
pay, and Dr. Wolfe’s valuable contribution to his
art will be thankfully received. It’s a pity that
clinics are not common in all professions. A
Legal clinic would fill a long-felt want.

Bishop Goe, of Melbourne, says that in
his opinion it would be more satisfactory if every-
one had to contribute to the support of the poor.
In other words, he wants a Poor Law brought
into force in Victoria. The poor of Melbourne
are certainly a great nuisance to the churches just
now. Money which is at present being lavished
in keeping them alive might, were a Poor Law in
force, be contributed to Bishop of Melbourne
Funds, Collections for the Conversion of the
Heathen and other pious purposes. The poor are
the enemies of the Plate, and Bishop Goe would
like them to be dealt with by Act of Parliament
accordingly.

What an incentive to ghastly humbug is a
Governor ! At a Dialectic gathering in Melbourne
last week they discussed the subject of happiness

A discussion on Psychical Research in the
Melbourne press has produced a correspondent
who glories in having devoted much time to a
“prayerful investigation of things occult.” Be-
ginning with crude materialistic phenomena, this
pious spook-hunter has “acquired undreamt of
knowledge from those whom ‘ the world ’ falsely
calls ‘dead.’” His knowledge from the libelled
cemetery lodgers seems to be simply a repetition
of Roman Catholic doctrines, and he might have
had it all from a live priest without spending his
substance on seances. Why doesn’t the man do
a good turn for Mrs. Needle by getting her alleged
victims to testify that they are not dead, anyway ?

Half-blanket Tozer is again on the war-
path. Having half-frozen the Queensland nigger
into oblivion, and provoked a civil war on
Palm Island, he has cast his economising optic
on the inmates of Dunwich Benevolent Asylum.
The Dunwich inmate is, on the average, about the
most decrepit ancient on the face of this earth,
and apparently only exists because he hasn’t
sufficient energy to expire decently. _ Tozer is
convinced, however, that the aforesaid inmate
can be turned to useful account, and has been
casting about (by committee) to provide him with
suitable employment. The Bulletin suggests
that the more able-bodied might be employed to
make coffins for the others.

A soulful young man writes from the dim
distance of Indiana, U.S., to the Victorian postal
authorities, asking to be placed in communication
with some fair daughter of Victoria who speaks
English, and enclosing a letter for the chosen

he probably writes under the impression that dis-
tant girls are green, and wants a pretty maid with
means to adopt an Indiana orphan “ with a view

IJalf-a-column of cables have come along

that the incident occurred in the vicinity of the

mysterious political significance, otherwise we
would like to know why we do not receive a cable

which might have terminated fatally happens to
the fat alderman who tries to slide on a melon-

“ The Church’s attitude towards pleasure,

N.S.W. ex-Attorney-General Barton : “ When an
accused person is committed for trial the pre-

the venerable age of the former maxim, the latter
is the view taken, in a recent appeal case, by the
English Privy Council.

Two Melbourne teachers were charged,
the other day, with the excessive whaling of a boy
for fighting with a fellow-pupil, and in the course
of the hearing Featherston, J.P., said that “he
thought boys should be encouraged to fight.” This
is very good, so far as it goes, but why should the
mental and physical advantages of bruising be
confined to boys? What’s the matter with girls
being encouraged to fight? Also women and
parsons ?

The Victorian railway department now
makes monthly tickets renewable on the 2nd.
instead of on the morning of the Ist. The local
civil servant isn’t paid until mid-day on the Ist.,
and on the morning of that eventful day he is so
stone-broke that he has invariably to walk in from
his suburb or else “bluff” the ticket-taker. Often,
on such an occasion, a whole train-load of dudes
haven’t one legitimate ticket among them, and as
the department can’t well arrest the whole train it
has decided to make the above concession to meet
the difficulty.

A splendid picture, the “ Slave Market at

public exhibition at Glasgow because some ot tne
slaves were not clothed up to the Scotch standard
of respectability. This is Caledonia s verdict on
the morality of the East. The East’s_ verdict on
the morals of Caledonia comes along in the story
of a Scotch-Australian traveller in a kilt, who was
arrested at Smyrna for making an objectionable
show of his legs—in other words, for not being
clothed up to the level of Asiatic decency and
who was only saved from the fury of a shocked
and outraged mob by the most stupendous efforts
of the local police.

As another instance of ho w the mighty have
been laid low there is an amusing story going tho
rounds telling how somebody (a man, fortunately
—any woman would have taken in the situation
at a wink), after vigorously tapping four times at
Sir Blank Blank’s residence, the other day, got no
response. Being indefatigable he paddled round
the back way, where he discovered two women
scrubbing away at the wash-tub, whom he took
to be part of the great man’s “menagerie.” “Is
Sir Blank at home?” enquired the visitor. “No,
he’s not,” said the stouter of the washer-ladies
(the cook, apparently). “Then is Lady Blank at
home?” “No, she’s gone out, too’’—whereupon
the baffled stranger beat a retreat. But the point
of the thing is that Lady Blank herself had been
the voice of the soap-suds, and she tells the yarn
out loud to her cronies with all the relish imagin-
able !

An experienced nurse in one of Sydney’s
best institutions says that the most pathetic part
of her duty is the breaking of the news to Irish
male patients that she can never be more than a
sister to them. Irishmen, she thinks, are more
impressionable in this way than men of other
nationalities during sick-bed attacks, and instead
of attributing their delivery from pain to physio
or religion are prone to turn the homely nurse into
a healing goddess.

Among the anecdotes current re the heroic
way in which the local aristocracy are tiding over
the" financial crisis first place is given to one told
of a Sydney household which has dismissed
all its servants. The house-daughters now do the
pot-and-shovel work entirely—but not in the half-
hearted style of the average young lady servant
who rebels against her lot with a smut on her
nose. These girls go to work in rotation and when
“on duty” wear caps and black dresses and look
old and valued friends calmly in the face when
they answer the door to them. Any acquaintance
venturing to shake hands is brought up short
with the announcement, “ I am on duty to-
day, sir (or madam),” and a stranger sampling the
menage would never guess that the young lady
who entertained so charmingly in the drawing-
room and rang Mary up to show the visitors out
would be “Mary” herself the following after-
noon. The only objection to doing the thing so
thoroughly is that a new and flirty baker’s man
might meaningly inquire the precise date of Miss
Asterisk’s Sunday out—but there are always
prosaic drawbacks to being a heroine.
Dear Bulletin, — Be the alleged interstices
in Barrister Purves’s temper—don’t you think, if
a man has much in him, he must have moods?”
The creature with only one side to its comport-
ment has generally only one side to its soul, and
many a reputation for self-control rests only on
the dead-level of demeanour which reflects a dead-
level of personality. The mind—like the atmos-
phere —needs occasional perturbation. The ocean
has “ moods ” of which the fish-pond knows
nothing.—A.M.

Contempt
for your ailments is simply committing suicide.
Every man is the centre of the universe to himself,
yet how many do we daily meet who complain of
weakness, liver complaint, neuralgia, and so on ?
Hundreds of such sufferers are met with every
week, who neglect their cases when there is a
reliable remedy in Clements Tonic at hand. This
preparation is distinct from the many disguised
purgatives called indigestion cures, the use of
which are most harmful to the patient. Clements
Tonic does not give relief by drastic catharsis, but
aims at curing the cause of the disorder, and then
the unpleasant symptoms cease. If you suffer,
remember that without treatment the disease
must increase, and that is criminal on your part
to neglect your case, at any rate, your life depends
on your getting proper treatment and may be the
lives of a wife and family. Therefore do not delay,
get Clements Tonic and do not be put off with
vile purgatives or substitutes, and you will meet
with the same success as Mr. Ohas. Strange, hair-
dresser and tobacconist, Auburn Street, Goul-
burn, N.S.W,, who writes on May 23rd, 1893 :
I have been a great sufferer from dyspepsia for the
last two or three years. I have tried several so-
called. cures for the above complaint, but never
received any benefit from them. Hearing so
much about Clements Tonic—in fact, I could
hardly take up a newspaper but I saw the cures
performed by your wonderful medicine—l resolved
to try it, and I am happy to say it has performed
a perfect cure in me, and I can strongly recom-
mend it to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint.—Yours respectfully, Chas. Strange, hair-
dresser and tobacconist, Auburn Street, Goul-
burn, N.S.W.
M'Burney, Wallis & Co.'s Report.
The recent rise in wool is still maintained and. although
both producer and broker could stand a still larger in-
crease, we should all feel satisfied at the turn the market
has taken, and the future promise the present improve-
ment in prices gives.
This week wool sold privately at rates fully equal to last
week’s auctions and this in itself is a proof that the recent
rise is no myth but a reality.
For some time we have predicted a slight increase in
the price of wool when the fast approaching season’s sales
open in real earnest.
We give our opinion right out because we think it a
selling broker’s duty to his constituents to give the best
possible idea of future prospects. If our prediction is
wrong we will still have the satisfaction of knowing we
gave our views according to indications, which we always
carefully note, and that we were not afraid to give pub-
licity to our thoughts. We think the sequal will prove
our prophecy correct.
From all parts of the country good seasons are reported,
and this, coupled with the strong probability of free
admission of our staple product to America and the fact
that w r e have just elected a Parliament of representatives
who seem bent on good government, should go far to
disnel the depression which has for so long a time lingered
with us.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Rev. Robinson, of Melbourne, boldine; forth on
the subject of racecourses, remarked lately that the
noblest men were never found at such places. M What,”
he enquired in a voice of awful scorn, ** would the world
say if Moody or Sankey were found on a racecourse ? ”
The world would probably take it for granted that they
had played out the preaching game and were making in-
vestigations in connection with the bookmaking racket.
The flesh and the devil would probably have ether and
different opinions in regard to the affair.

“Jack” Murray, M.L.A. for Warrnambool

gamblers on earth—and, as a race, a by-word for stagna-
tion. As for vitality, the lowest forms of life cling to it
with the greatest tenacity. How does the Johnsonian
Mr. Murray dispose of these snags 7

In 1882 old man Grace made an average of 28
runs for 12 innings against the Australians. In 1893 he
batted 16 times against them for an average of 42, yet
there is no direct evidence that “colonial” bowling and
fielding had deteriorated in those 11 years. The figures
only prove (or certain that W.Gt. has taken better care of
himself than the majority of the players of 1882.

A Melbourne “ bookmaker ” has been sentenced
tb nine months’ imprisonment for welshing a 13-year-old
urchin who backed the winner for ss. on behalf of his
mother. Chief Justice Madden, with painful faoetious-
ness, described the youngster as a turf commission agent.
As a matter of fact, the bet, being a cash transaction in
Bourke-street, was unlawful, though the previous con-
viction of a man for street betting was quashed
the same day, on the ground that his little book wasn’t
an instrument of gaming within the Act. Pity that
children can rank as commission agents within the Act.

The indisputable derivation of “ barrack ” is the
same as that of “ barrikin ” (appropriately rhyming with
“ larrikin ”), which means “ jargon,” and is derived from
the old French “ baracan,” modern 11 baragouin ” mean-
ing “ gibberish.” If it isn’t, it ought to be.

This, now going the rounds, deserves to be
true if it isn’t: When Brewer rode his first steeplechase,
at Flemington, he and Batty came down at the same
fence, right away at the back. Not very much hurt, the
novice was picking up his saddle to walk in when the
veteran said: “ Lie still, you fool, and they’ll be round
with the ambulance-waggon to fetch us home.”

William O. Yuille, a well-known Melbourne
turfite and sporting writer—pen-name, “ Peeping Tom ”
—died on the 19th inst., aged 75. Only journalists who
take to sport and liquor ever reach such a ripe old age.
• * • •
Yuille was a luckless and lucky man, of varied
career. One fancies, at this late time of dav, that his
abilities were somewhat underrated. Mere chance could
not have given him so many retrieves. First of all, he
ought to have stood in with the Wilsons and Fiskens,
being a squatting pioneer of the Ballarat district. This
left him an adventurer, but he became the White of his
day on the turf. Again was he in a manner stranded
when be had to become a racing scribe. Another turn of
the wheel oast him out of office, through the prestige of
“ Augur ” Chapman. Yuille and Hammersley joined in
their jeremiads on the black ingratitude of the Austra-
lasian, nor did Chapman altogether fancy retirement
when his time came. Yuille, meanwhile, thanks in great
measure to his son, Archie, got up in the stirrups again
with his agency business. Two whopping sales which
fell to him were those of Maribyrnong and St. Albans.

Those political pietists who openly opposed the
totalisator in Victoria are now pleading (or the legalisa-

mentof “principle” is thatart-unionsare necessary to the
success of the A.N.A. Ffite. The alleged national demonstra-
tion resulted in a deficit of £240, instead of a large profit,
when the promoters ventured to dispense with the old
shilling lottery.

The highly humorous farce, gone through by the
Melb. Thespian footballers, of bringing out a cannon and
deliberately shooting the umpire at the conclusion of the

good results. It would save the victim from a mors lin-
gering death at the hands of the barrackers.

“ Griffo” had to back out of his meeting with
Dixon—weight the trouble. Could Griff, have come down
to weight the match would have been full of interest.
That the meeting would have been such a one-sided affair
in favour of Griffo the writer does not believe. Griffo
esn play as tsst a tattoo with left and right as any man
the world has produced, but hard hitter and finisher he is ,
not; and his style of fighting all for the head would have
lees effect upon a negro than a white man, besides the
greater risk of knocking his hands up. In any case, it
would take the Australian a long time to finish off a clever
opponent like Dixon, who might get in one of his
smashers at any moment and weaken Qriffo; and once
weak, it remains to be seen if Griflo’s constitution, after
years of mad dissipation, is still sound enough to pull
him through.

In a Maoriland mining town, a little while ago,
the clever division—which usually “gets left"—was
“left” in a worse fashion even than usual. There were a
dozen horses entered for the principal race, and all of
them were backed in ’the totalisator save one. This
despised exception was 'a ragged-looking, depressed,
muddy and miserably unkempt beast which seemed to
belong jointly to five foolish-looking individuals, two of
whom were drinking in a pub. while their racer hung on
its bridle outside. Of the other three, one seemed drunk
and feebly incapable, while the remaining pair were
having a fight in the middle of the road. No one even
suspected that all this elaborate exhibition was got up to
scare off investors, and the hairy beast languished out-
side the pub. and remained unbacked and rejected. A few
minutes before the racs the syndicate of owners sent a con-
federate to put £1 on in the totalisator, and when they came
on the course they noted with satisfaction that their
lonesome coin was the only one invested on the horse.
Then they went in and won the race, and marched back
in a body to the tote to meet their mate, who still held
the ticket, and collect the whole £4OO or so in the
machine in one fatal dividend. But the mate wasn’t
present. Instead of him a fat and foolish-looking German
farmer was there getting the money, and walking away
with it before their horrified eyes. Further inquiry dis-
covered the mate drunk in an adjacent hotel, and
the whole dreadful truth came out. Instead of
putting on the money he had got tight with it,
and when the owners noted with satisfaction that there
was only one investor on their horse it was Hans’ invest-
ment, not theirs, that they were looking at; and now
Hans, who was so stuffed with notes that he seemed to
have a watermelon in his pocket, had departed with all
the money in the town. And all the syndicate had to
show for its elaborate scheme was a tired horse, and a
drunken mate, and a vanished pound, and a feeling as if the
worm mentioned in Jeremiah was gnawing at its vitals.

Gov. Duff’s son rode The Count in the Corin-

own account the wrong way. If the gubernatorial jocks,
continue to improve at this rate they may, in the distant
future, win a race. Mr. Wells rode a good race on Tauri,
winning by a couple of lengths from Kinkora.

A Sunday paper says it would be a million to
one on Griffo in a 20-round contest with Dixon at catch

catch weights means an untrained, beer-soddened wreck.

Premier Patterson has been retiring

nomer Ellery, too, is over 67, and very far from
played out. Professor Halford, Dean of the
Faculty of Medicine of Melb. University, is, at
70, passing through the press a new book on the
physiological effects of snake-poison.
The teetotal vote for the Nepean (N.S.W.)
was oast solidly and queerly. S. E. Lees, the old
(and also the new) member, is a teetotaller and
temperance advocate, but he favoured compensa-
tion being given to dislicensed publicans. His
opponent, T. R. Smith, publican and auctioneer,
publicly supported “ local option without com-
pensation.” And the water-jugglers voted for the
publican to a man, ’tis said. Which is probable
enough, as the publican failed by 100 votes.
, Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday. A Sydney D.T. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-goo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture. Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under Pro-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, sold at corner of Pitt and Park streets,
Sydney.
Governor Duff (N.S.W.) has instructed
private-secretary Galton to write to the French
Consul-General stating that he (the Gov.) is much
gratified at the manner in which the Carnot
requiem mass was conducted, and desires to con-
vey his thanks to everybody concerned. Mr. Galton
has signified accordingly, and the official gratifi-
cation, having filtered through these various
channels, has presumably reached the right
quarter. As an example of Caledonian gauoherie
this is almost unique.

Frank Cotton, arch-Single-taxer, was re-

as a queer political fish ; but his absence will be a
distinct loss to the debating power of N.S.W.
Assembly.
The direct Labour vote in New South
Wales at the 1894 election was only about half
that of 1891. Which is only another proof that,
under manhood suffrage, the country gets just
the sort of Parliament it deserves. On the
present occasion it seems to have got that kind of
Parliament even more than usual.
In the Sydney and suburban constituencies
30 members out of 40 sit for absolute minorities.
In the 85 N.S.W. country electorates 20 members
sit for absolute majorities and 45 represent
minorities, which gives, out of a total of 125, 75
electorates whose electors didn’t want the sitting
members to be returned.
Thomas Walker has been rejected for
Northumberland, in favour of a new man. With
all his faults and misfortunes, had he been a ser-
vant of the Pastoralists’ Union or the Employers’
Union, and been as steadfast in the cause of his
masters as he has been in the cause of the miners,
he would have been more considerately treated.
All things considered, Angus Cameron’s
return to N.S.W. political life as member for
Waverley is a surprising resurrection. Angus is
now a teetotal potentate, and takes round the plate
in church ; he actually got the votes of the local
water-brigade against that well-established saint,
Alfred Allen, poet and Freetrade whip, whom,
after many years, the “great Freetrade party”
cold-bloodedly threw over. Cameron, who started
political life as a Labour-member, now opposes
payment of members. Until the last few weeks
he has been in possession of a little Govt, billet,
which, of course, he has now had to give up ; but
it is presumed he will consent, if pressed, to
accept his .£3OO a year as a member —pending his
probable election to the Chairmanship of Com-
mittees at .£BOO a year.
Dear Bulletin, —In S.M. Herald, Carlyle
(B. A.) quotes Talmage as saying that the destruc-
tion of the Tabernacle “seemed a strange,
mysterious Providence.” In another part of the
same paper the daughter of a Sydney resident,
present at the fire, says she and Mrs. Talmage
saw a man behind the organ, where the flames first
broke out. She adds : —“The organist says no
one had any right there, so it is quite possible the
fire was the work of an incendiary.” Now, when
I was in Brooklyn in June last year, the papers
reported that the Tabernacle had just been re-
novated at great expense, and the contractors
pressed for payment. The church could not
find the money, and Dr. Talmage—so it
was said—urged the contractors to take half what
was due to them, and give the rest to the glory of
God ; adding that, if they did not come to terras,
he would have the church, and they would not get
paid at all. The contractors protested that they
would be ruined, but they came to terms. It
strikes me that Talmage’s “strange, mysterious
Providence” is none other than he whom the
ancients knew as Nemesis. —Q.

The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Com-
Eany, Limited, report: In the local market there has
een nothing doing during the past week, but our advices
from London show that in the home market prices are
being fairly well maintained at the advance established
at the opening of the sales now in course of progress.
The auctions will close in London this week, and the
quantities to be carried forward have been kept within
moderate limits. Latest telegraphic advices from
America announcing the proposed alteration in the tariff
are very unfavourable. Wool was to have been admitted
free by Ist August, but there now appear to be grave
doubts as to whether the Wilson Bill, just passed by the
U.S. Senate, will ever become law at all.

find their amusement in listening to his discourses.

People who like to go to bed with creepy-

A London paper, the Man of the World,
steals without acknowledgment one of Henry
Lawson’s stories, originally published in The
Bulletin, and localises it in a horribly clumsy
fashion, turning the bushmen into English race-
course sharpers, and so on. Then the Sydney
Bird of Freedom —which, by the way, stole its
own name from one of John Corlett’s papers—re-
prints the tale, carefully crediting it to the London
paper. It might have had the original story on
the same terms, but the Sydney press somehow
prefers to thieve its Bulletin matter via London.
A gruesome tale of lingering agony and an
unimaginably horrible death from Casino (N.S.
Wales.). A timber-getter, in a lonely part of the
bush, inserted one of his hands between two great
logs to remove some wedges, when the rolling of
one log imprisoned the hand. Like a rat caught
in a trap, he lay there unable to loosen himself,
cooeying probably for help, but in vain. Eight
days afterwards his decaying body was found by a
stray visitor. How long he lingered, struggling
against thirst and famine and pain and whether his
agonies found relief in the anaesthesia of uncon-
sciousness-will never be known. Poor devil!
Even his name was not thought worth recording
as information to any possible friends.
In the small island of Raratonga, under
the old missionary regime , there were i. 55 police-
men to a little over 2000 inhabitants. Fines were
divided between the arresting constable and the
Judge, so the force arrested pretty nearly every
householder in the island several times in the
course of the year, and if there was much diffi-
culty about a conviction the “cop” in charge of
the case sometimes caned the wife and daughters
of the accused to make them give evidence. Govt.
Resident Moss says he has abolished the system of
dividing fines, and has dismissed 143 of the con-
stables, all “influential church members.” An
insurrection of retrenched policemen is now
looming.
Dear Bulletin, —Re word “ Gumsucker ”
as applied to native-born Victorians and Tas-
manians, thus a veteran lady colonist: “ A Van
Diemaniac swain, riding through a wattle-scrub
one day on the look-out for gum for his best girl,
noticed a large and inviting lump on an overhang-
ing limb. He tried to twist it off with his fingers,
but failed—and he had no knife. Dragging him-
self up with both hands he began to work it off
with his teeth, when, horror! he found his jaws
firmly stuck to the bough. In his struggles the
horse took fright and bolted from under him,
leaving him dangling in the air ! Years after-
wards some splitters found the skeleton still
‘ jawed ’ to a wattle-bough, and so another
‘ mysterious disappearance ’ was cleared up! ”
Hence “ Gumsucker.”—W.J.H.
Thus “ Journeyman Signwriter ” ;
Dear Bulletin,— “The most thriving trade at present
in Sydney is that of the sign-writer.” Indeed? Now
allow me, it is about the most slush-trailed calling in
Australia. The work being done requiring skill and taste
is so scant that the trade is being steadily monopolised
by boys, and, that curse of all callings, “ improvers.”
Firms which but a few years ago held reputation for
masterly work are run almost exclusively on the work of
unfledged hobbledehoys, while expert craftsmen walk
about two-thirds of their time feasting their eyes on the
sculptures adorning moribund financial institutions. To
paint the plainest sign correctly should call for some
ability ; but the introduction of grotesquerie in lettering
has changed all that. Any diversion from grace or
regularity is now accepted as something catchy. The
general public seem unable to discriminate between
bungling distortion and freedom from stiffness: and so
the youthful “ scab,” who could not form a fair Roman
letter to save his soul, steps in and plasters Sydney with
hideously-lettered calico streamers, while the idle trades-
man may turn bilious viewing them. Apropos, there
seems to be a strong affinity between calico, shoddy and
scab-work generally.

asks for information on any conceivable subject
will be gravely told that he will find out all about
it in, say, vol. clxvi., and then the writer hur-

Ed. Bulletin.— N.S.W. National Ass and
L.E.L. shout in concert for “water conservation

with the waste waters of our internal rivers.” The
question is whether there are, except in flood-
time, any waste waters to deal with ? The Mur-
rumbidgee discharges 630 cubic feet a second in
ordinary seasons. According to Binnie, this
would suffice, on the Indian scale of supply, to
irrigate 30,000 acres. In India, the great Ganges
canal, with a sectional area of 1150 feet, only irri-
gates 800,000, and draws its supply from a per-
ennial river fed by the greatest glaciers and
snowfields (outside the polar regions) in the world.
Australia has no river capable of feeding a great
irrigation system ; but anything will do for an

“YOUR LIFE IS NOT WORTH A STRAW."
Not worth a straw, eh ? Then it was worth just
nothing-nothing at all. Who has not used that
comparison a thousand times to express absolute
worthlessness? A straw? The wind blows it
away, fire burns it up, cattle tread it in the mud,
it rots by the roadside. What of it? Who cares
for a straw ?
Yet this is exactly what a doctor recently said
to-one of his patients, “ Your life is not worth a
straw.” How much is a doctor worth who will
speak so to one that trusts him, and has no hope
but in his skill? For my part, if he were up for
sale at auction, I would bid one straw tor him—no
more. Even if what he said was true, he had no
right to say it. Such a doctor is more likely to
kill with his tongue than to cure with his drugs.
A woman tells the story, and she tells it well.
If it doesn’t sound like the truth, then I don’t
know what ever does. The dates and the facts
are all there, plain and orderly.
“In the summer of 1878,” she says, “I found
myself feeling tired, languid, low-spirited, and
weak. I felt as if some evil were about to happen.
My appetite was poor, and after eating I had
excruciating pain at my loins and sides. There
was a horrible gnawing pain at the pit of my
stomach, and a rising in the throat as if I should
choke. My head felt as though I had a ton weight
on it. Gradually I got worse, and for months
could take only liquid food. At night I lay awake
for hours altogether.
“Later on I suffered greatly from nervous
prostration. My legs trembled and shook so I
feared to fall. If a knock came to the door I
trembled from head to foot. I had frequent attacks
which began with palpitation of the heart and
sudden stoppage of the breath. At these times I
was speechless and helpless. They say I looked
like a corpse, cold and bloodless, my finger-nails
and lips having turned black. After a while this
would pass off, leaving me weak and prostrate.
I got so emaciated and thin that I was only a bag
of bones, and so weak I had to take hold of the
furniture to steady myself as I crossed the room.
As time went on the nervousness and forebodings
of evil so increased that I feared I should go out
of my mind. The neighbours said it would be a
mercy if the Lord would release me from my
sufferings.
“ In this condition I continued for over four
years, during which time I consulted five doctors,
but nothing they gave me did any good. They all
said my ailment was heart disease, and one said,
‘ Your life is not worth a straiv.’
“In despair I gave up taking physic, as I felt
that nothing would save me. In May, 1882 ten
years ago, a lady (Mrs, Richardson) called at my
house, told me of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup,
and strongly advised me to try it. I did so, and
felt somewhat better after the first bottle; and by
the time I had taken three bottles I was completely
cured, I rom that to this I have had no return of
the attacks, and am so strong I can do any kind
of work. But for Seigel’s Syrup I should have
been in my grave long ago. I wish others to know
this, and will answer any who call or write.”
(Signed) Emma Wiokbnden (wife of William
Wickenden, gardener), Pembroke Villas, 123
Moffat Road, Thornton Heath, March 17th, 1892!
So it turned out that her life was not only worth
a straw, but worth a whole golden harvest of health
and better days. Yet no thanks to the doctors.
Her complicated symptoms puzzled and alarmed
them, to be sure, but why? Is it not the doctors’
duty to understand such things ? Most assuredly.
Just as a lawyer should know the law, or a pilot
the rooks, tides, and lights of a coast. Had some
of those medical men known that Mrs. Wicken-
den’s malady was indigestion and dyspepsia, and
not heart disease, they might possibly have re-
lieved her. But, confused by the symptoms, they
wore blind to the cause. We may well wonder if
there are many such doctors in England.
Gases like this show that the clear sight belonged
to Mother Seigel; and to her remedy hosts of
people in this country are indebted for physical
salvation when, in very truth, their lives seemed
as straws.
Remember, this was ten years ago, and the
malady has not returned, showing that the cure
was a permanent one.
Napoleon Bonaparte I.
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH.
THE SECRET OF HIS SUCCESS.
How he Preserved his Nervous System.
liiißai
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, second son of
Charles Bonaparte and his wife, Letizia de
Ramolins, was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, on the
15th of August, 1769. In the year 1779 he entered
the Royal Military School of Brienne le Oh&teau.
There he remained till the autumn of 1784, when
he was transferred to the Military School of Paris,
according to the usual routine. He lost his father
in 1785, and the same year he was commissioned
a second lieutenant of artillery, and served as such
at Valence and other garrisons.
Napoleon attempted to obtain military power
in Corsica, but having failed, he fled to France,
where his career as a soldier and leader of men
became the most wonderful known to history, both
before and after that period. He was soon pro-
moted to chef de batallion, and commanded the
artillery at the siege of Toulon, where he highly
distinguished himself, and was the author of the
plan of attack which led to the fall of the place.
He was then promoted general of brigade.
On the fall of Robespierre, Napoleon was ordered
to take command of an infantry brigade in the
Army of the West. Thinking this beneath his
dignity, he refused to comply with the order, and
was discharged as a general. He was, however,
appointed second in command of the Army of the
Interior, Oct. 5, 1795, under Barras, and repelled
next day an attack of the sections of Paris.
Napoleon was appointed to the command of the
Army of Italy, Feb. 23, 1796; he married on
March 9, same year, Josephine Tascher de la
Pagorie, widow of General Victome Alexandra
de Beauharnais, and left Paris immediately for
Italy. _ Napoleon’s great military genius flashed
forth in its full brilliancy in this his first
campaign. His power lay in the rapidity and
boldness of his decisions, and in the untiring
energy with which he carried them out, confound-
ing his enemies by the suddenness and lightning
rapidity of his blows, which never gave them time
to recover. He performed a very clever move, by
penetrating the point of junction of two strong
armies which were opposing the French army, the
one consisting of 20,000 Piedmontese under Colli,
the other of 38,000 Austrians, under Beaulieu, and
succeeded most wonderfully, although the French
army was only 36,000 strong.
From now his career was one continuation of
triumphal successes, until almost the whole of
Europe and other important parts of the world
was at his mercy. He soon became elected First
Consul for life, and in 1804 he assumed the title of
Emperor, and this was decreed by the Senate
shortly afterwards. The institutions which he
created, and which still remain, were the restored
church, the judicial system, the codes, the system
of Local Government, the University, the Bank
of France and the Legion of Honour. Space will
not permit to describe his unfortunate end, but
suffice it to say, that the wonderful nerve-power,
which he possessed and preserved to the last, was
absolutely due to a secret medical preparation
discovered in Corsica, by a medical relation of his,
and without which his nerves would have been
shattered long before he had reached his great
triumphs.
This great nerve invigorator is known as the
Napoleon Vigour Powder, and is now being intro-
duced into Australia, the sole Australian agents
being The Imperial Drug Company, 239 Eliza-
beth-street (near Bathurst-street), Sydney, who
will forward free pamphlets and all particulars on
application.
The Napoleon Vigor Powder is simply marvel-
lous for restoring a broken-down nervous' system,
either brought on through early follies or other-
wise, and an excellent preventative against and
cure for nervousness, despondency, melancholia,
lost vitality and debility. The remedy is sold in
boxes at 65., or in courses of 5 boxes at 255. Double
course, 455. posted. Pamphlets, remedies, &0.,
and all particulars sent strictly unobserved by the
agents, the Imperial Drug Co., 239 Elizabeth-street,
Sydney, to whom all cheques, Post Office money-
orders, postal notes, &c., should be made payable.

The Caligraph Writing Machine,
p: <4^*
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that th'<J platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

A Prayer for the Poor.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ye rich, who, while the night-wind rustles round,
Recline, luxurious, on your downy bed,
Amid the wealth-made comforts which abound,
Think not of wretches to their hovels fled,
Or of the thousands who are nightly led
Beneath the trembling trees their lodge to take,
And only live to want when once they wake.
Oh poor, ye sorrow-stricken, levelled low
And held within the grasp ot misery;
Oh, ye on whom descended is the blow
Of penury’s affliction, till the tree
Of life is withered, fading hopelessly ;
Oh, ye who rest unroofed in storm and calm,
God grant you help, on you bestow His balm.

Dear Bulletin, — I was never in a very
tight place myself, but when a small boy I re"
member, seeing a playmate pretty securely fixed-
It was in the bush at Cardigan, ne;xr Ballarat;
the boy had gone up a tree after “ baldies ” (young
magpies). It was a p ouliar tree ; a recent wind-
storm had split the trunk almost to the ground,
and one half of the tree had swayed over into the
fork of an iron-bark ; the other half remained
upright. The youngster had secured the birds,
and was coming down again, when the old magpie
went for him, with a clatter of wings and the
sharp click of its pointed beak. The scare upset
thy mate ; lie slipped and fell, side-on, into the cleft
of the divided tree, where he jambed, kicking his
hardest, and shrieking like mad for all his friends
and relations. Presently a strong gust of wind
bent the standing nortion of the gum, and the boy
settled well down into the split. The tree fetched
up agairi, and that boy said no more, but I heard
a horrible sound, and saw something that drove
me, wild-eyed and corpse-faced, to the nearest
farmhouse, with a babbling, screaming, tear-
choked story, that nobody could understand for
several minutes. The tree had to be cut down to
recover the body, and whilst the chopping was
going on, a man had to stand by with a stick to
keep the old magpie from picking at the dead
boy’s head. —Silas Snell.
The teetotal majority at Balclutha (M.L.)
lately got into a series of complications, the end
of which is still uncertain. At the local option
poll the hop-beer party carried everything before
it, and it was decided, amid general enthusiasm,
that every accursed pub. in Balclutha was to be
abolished. A little while later the annual election
of the licensing committee came on. As there
were to be no more licenses there was obviously no
need for a committee, but the Act said that one
should be elected, so the formality had to be gone
through. Also, the blundering Electoral Act
declared that every person who didn’t vote at any
kind of an election —even if it was only the
election of a dog-catcher—would be disfranchised,
so the teetotallers had to vote with the rest for
fear they should be struck off the rolls and
shouldn’t be on hand to support the Cold Tea
ticket next time they were wanted. Next it tran-
spired that the Mayor, even though he wasn’t
elected, could claim the position of chairman, and
the Balclutha Mayor, who was a moderate drinker
and a backslider, took the billet accordingly.
After that a forgotten Act was dug up whereby
the granting of wholesale liquor-licenses rested
with the chairman only, whereupon that son of
Belial granted a wholesale grog-license to every
publican in the town, while the committee gnashed
its teeth in impotent fury, and protested. Supreme
Court proceedings are now in full blast, and the
Balclutha grog problem will most likely wind up
in the Privy Council.
A mixed kind of case, with no visible moral
attached to it, was heard last week up South
The plaintiff, a time-payment furniture gentle-
man, got painfully into the witness-box and
explained that he had sold a quantity of tables
and chairs and the like to a lady residing in a
certain unsavoury back street, and she didn’t pay
up. Therefore, he went to recapture the furniture,
but the lady smashed his property before his eyes
with an axe, and set the dog on him, and he
retired, a baffled and bitten Hebrew. The de-
fendant swore tiiat she couldn’t write; therefore,
she couldn’t have signed the furniture agreement
which the chewed and injured plaintiff presented ;
therefore the whole story was a base fabrication.
Two male witnesses swore that she did sign the
agreement, and some female witnesses, of the
•kind who habitually wear their hair hanging down
their backs, and whose shoes are down at heel,
and make a flapping sound when they walk,
attested that she couldn’t write, and therefore
didn’t sign it. It further transpired that the
defendant had been married three times —one
husband had died in India; another was drowned;
and the third was in gaol for welting her during
the honeymoon. He was expected out soon, and
then he would probably welt her again. The case
was just getting' interesting about here, when the
court stopped it by giving judgment all round in
favour of Mr. Kahoozelstein, and a number of
dishevelled ladies, most of them in an interesting
condition, who were apparently waiting to give
evidence, retired in disgust.
AN EMINENT DIVINE.
THE REV. DR. DE WITT TALMAGE.
HIS LECTURING TOUR IN AUS-
TRALASIA.
Through the courtesy of the Waterbury Watch
Company (whose Australasian head office is at 54
Margaret-street, Sydney), we are enabled to
present our readers with a portrait of the Rev.
Dr. T. De Witt Talmage, the famous preacher
and lecturer, who is so well-known as the pastor
of the Brooklyn Tabernacle, New York. Dr.
Talmage’s ideal vacation is, as the American terms
it, “a stay” at his new and beautiful country
home in Long Island, a few miles from Sag Har-
bour. But the rev. gentleman could not indulge
his fancy for more than two weeks this season, as
he recently started on a trip round the world with
his son, Dr. Talmage, of Pittsburg, as his com-
panion. During a portion of his trip the doctor
will be occupied in delivering a series of lectures
in Australasia, under the auspices of that ex-
perienced manager, Mr. R. S. Smythe. He gave
the opening lecture of the series at Auckland on
June 21, and since that date he has been addres-
sing crowded audiences in New Zealand. He was
announced to deliver his first lecture in Sydney
last Thursday night, and his Australian tour pro-
mises to be a great success. The wonderful
Waterbury Watches have always been favourite
timekeepers among the clergy ; and reasonably so,
for the Waterburys are durable, accurate, elegant,
and inexpensive. They rarely get out of order,
and can be repaired at a merely nominal cost.
Henry Ward Beecher, another eminent American
preacher, was an enthusiastic admirer of the
Waterbury Watches, one of which he always
wore. And G. H. Lea (of Liverpool), the South
African missionary, carried a Waterbury through-
out his recent journey of two thousand miles in
South Africa. “It went splendidly the whole
time, and was twice immersed in water without
being injured.” Mr. Lea also took with him a
twenty-guinea English lever, which went only
two months from the time it was purchased. Dr.
Talmage lately celebrated with his friends the
25th anniversary of the beginning of his pastorate
in the church which he has made famous through-
out Christendom. As a leading New York con-
temporary observed the other day, “Dr. Talmage
deserves all the honours that may be paid to him.
During the last 20 years he has been a great power
for good in the world. Millions of men have
heard his voice, and tens of millions of both sexes
have been brought within the sphere of his in-
fluence by the printed page. May he live to cele-
brate the golden anniversary of his connection
with the Church of the Tabernacle !”


The QUEENSLAND MEAT
TRADE .
Important Operations.
THE GRAZIERS’ BUTCHERING AND MEAT EXPORT
COMPANY.
Thh pastoral industry has long been accepted as
the staple support of Queensland, and the question
has always been an anxious one how to produce
stock with a sufficient margin of profit to the
owner, over and above the working expenses of an
ordinary sheep or
cattle station. The
prevailing low price
of cattle, followed
by a fall in the
prioeofwool, caused
the pastoral indus-
try in Queensland
to have a very
gloomy outlook.
When it is remem-
bered that nearly
the whole of the
coastal district, as
also the Western
slope of the table-
land and much of
the Gulf country,
is grazed exclu-
sively in the pro-
duction of cattle,
the industry may
be safely considered
an important one.
The chief drawback
hitherto has been
the absence of pro-
fitable local mar-
kets, or of such
utilisation in the
meat export trade as to absorb the surplus
stock at a price that would recompense
the_ producer and bring a term of pros-
perity to the province. For years past the
Queensland cattle-trade has been almost a dead
letter, but it is pleasing to observe that a re-
action has set in, and of such a character as to
play a prominent part in the fast-approaching
and undeniable future prosperity of Queensland.
What is alluded to is the meat-export trade,
which promises to
play a leading part
in the future suc-
cess of Queensland,
and the people
who are pioneer-
ing the industry
deserve Queens-
land’s warmest
thanks.
The Graziers’
Butchering and
Meat Export Com-
pany of Brisbane
do the largest
Queensland busi-
ness as meat-pre-
servers and ex-
porters, and as they
are among the most
successful operators
in the trade, an
outline of their im-
portant works and
organisation will be
here given. They
made their first
appearance in the
ranks of meat ex-
porters in 1887.
Prior to that their
business had been
confined to the
province of Queens-
land as wholesale
and retail butchers. Recognising that the meat
products of the province had far outgrown
home requirements, and that an outlet must
be sought in the markets of the world, they
also realised that the future expansion of their
business must embrace the wider field of meat-
packing and exporting. Having so decided they
sought and obtained their first contract for pre-
served meat, which was for the supply of the
French troops in Cochin-China, and during the
year 1887 they ex-
ported preserved
meats to the extent
of 277,3301b5. In
the same year, the
firm’s exports of
salt-meat amounted
to 38,3501b5., which
was, in the follow-
ing year, 1888, in-
creased to 55,6261b5.
So high was the
appreciation of the
excellent q u ality
and perfect curing
of their salt-meat
that it rapidly
found favour wher-
ever it was sent ;
and the exports of
this c o mm od it y
steadily rose dur-
ing 1889, ’9O and ’9l
to 164,9161b5.,
214,9101b5. and
265,1601b5. respec-
tively. Mean-
while, the contract
for the supply of
the French troops
had been satisfac-
torily executed, and
a second contract
entered into, and
during the period
named the annual exports of preserved meats
had risen to 469,8051bs for 1891. In the next
year, 1892, there was a slight diminution in the
total quantity of salt meat exported, being
216,2021b5. for the year. This, however, was
partly owing to the increased attention demanded
by the preserved-meat business, which rose to
1,614,8961b5. for the year, the greater part being
supplied under contract to the Dutch Government
in Batavia, and so satisfied were the Dutch authqri-
ties with the excellent quality of the meats supplied
that a fresh contract was made for a further period
of three years. The exports for last year (1893)
amounted to 395,3401b5. of salt meat and
2,571,3041b5. of preserved meats —excluding that
sent to Australian ports. A contract for the
supply of all salt meat required for the use of the
Imperial Navy on the Australian station has just
expired. The foregoing quantities represent only
the amount of preserved and salt meats exported
from Queensland by the Graziers’ Meat Export
Company during the years under review, and are
quite irrespective of the very large quantities dis-
posed of within the colony, in addition to the
extensive regular business of the firm as wholesale
butchers. The Graziers’ Butchering and Meat
Export Company are ever on the alert for a satis-
factory extension of their business. They have

that their meats, both preserved and frozen, will

can there establish large depots and other re-

result both in establishing and guarding the trade,
Retail shops could be run in connection with these

attached to the London-Australian meat trade is
that the market is occasionally worked in the
interest of an unscrupulous few, who sell the best
Australian meat as English, and substitute
inferior quality carcases for the Australian. With
a view of opening up an advantageous London
trade, Mr. William Baynes, the senior member of
the firm, left Brisbane for London, via Vancouver,
about two months ago, and no doubt this will be
the signal for a very large annual output from the
Queensport works. Nor will the operations of
this progressive company be confined exclusively
to Unsbane. Already the management is in

Graziers’ Butchering Co. to start freezing works
at Charleville, and the matter is now under con-
sideration.

gressive company are situated at Queensport, ten

or more branch shops throughout the city and
suburbs. The Bonito is the steam-launch, in use

trade, a fine, roomy cargo boat and well suited for
the purpose. The works are well worthy of a visit,

most favourably with any similar enterprise in
Australia. Everything is carried out on a labour-
saving basis, right from the killing-yards to the
finished label, showing the meat tinned and ready
for export. None but the primest “fats” are
used, and are purchased as near to Brisbane as
possible so that they may be easily driven, as
railway trucking tends to reduce the weight and
frets the cattle considerably. Four head of cattle
are killed at a time until the day’s supply is com-
Dieted. An overhead carriage conveys each
carcase to the weighing-room and thence to the
“ boneing-room,” where the refuse is conveyed to
the digesters and the meat to the salting and
preserving-rooms. Eight digesters are in use
and they can put through 270 sheep at each
boiling. Therefore, the capacity for turning
all waste into profitable tallow is considerable,
It is intended to manufacture oleomargarine in
connection with the works. Important additions
are being added to the main building and the
“oleo.” branch has had a good start, the Com-
pany having entered into a four years’ contract
for supply and delivery of the commodity. We
must not overlook the fellmongery and wool-scour-
ing works at Belmont, now in course of completion,
which, when finished, will be the best in Queens-
land. The beautifully soft and pure Bulimba
water is used, and
the plant when in
full power is capable
of turning out 100
bales per day. The
tallow and wool are
sent to London,
per British - India
steamers, in regular
monthly shipments.
The retort-rpqm is
a very important
feature of the estab-
lishment. There
are 13 on
each side of the
room, and in each
one can be easily
packed 100 21b. tins.
We are then
shown the packing
and lacq'uering
room, in itself a
very pretty sight.
The pine wood
eases are filled with
one-dozen tins each,
containing three
“kilos,” equal to
six-and-three-fifths
lbs. English weight,
of preserved meat.
This is portion
of an important
order for the
Dutch Govt., at Batavia, and on each tin is
labelled “ The Graziers’ Butchering and Meat
Export Company, Brisbane River, Queensland.
Corned Beef, 3 kilo, August 1894.” Cases of four
different sizes are forwarded to Batavia, and it
would appear that the Dutch Govt, has distinc-
tive oases for the army and navy, so as to facilitate
transport. One size carries 12 tins, each tin con-
taining 3 “kilo” of beef, another four tins of
3 kilo, a third 36 tins of 1 kilo each, and the
fourth 12 tins of 1
kilo each. Six
shipments of 5000
cases each leave
the works yearly
for Batavia. Not-
withstanding the
important contracts
in hand for pre-
served beef, the
Company is enabled
to prepare some of
the choicest and
most delectable
articles of the trade.
Mr. Harry Baynes,
under whose special
supervision the
meat-preserving
branches are con-
ducted, states that
the Queen sport
works are in full
operation. More
orders are in hand
than can be con-
veniently fulfilled,
so that in tender-
ing at the present
time there is no
attempt to cut the
prices too fine.
“We are work-
ing day and night,”
said the manager,
“and I am often puzzled as to how to com-
plete orders—soo men under my charge, and I
could find work for three times as many had we
the appliances. Look at our contracts ! Thirty
thousand cases of preserved meats have to leave
here annually in oases chiefly of 78Ibs. of meat in
each, and this for the Dutch Government alone.
Large supplies go to N.S. Wales, Victoria, and
Fiji, and the bulk of the Western Australia meat
trade is in our hands.” “ What do you make ? ”
“ Anything and
everything in the
way of preserved
meats to suit
the requirements
of a big Au s-
tralasian and fast-
growing foreign
export trade, a a
a glance at our
stock-lists will
show you. Every
thing that the
trade requires and
everything tinned
by us is pure, fresh
and palatable.”
“Things ought
to be good here,”
continued Mr.
Baynes. “We
buy the best of
cattle from the pas-
ture lands of the
valley of the Bris-
bane and the
uplands of the Esk
and Nanango dis-
tricts. We have
fine paddocks and
lucerne fields at
Belmont and Sandy
Creek where the
cattle are rested
and put in good condition before being killed.
We have thoroughly complete works for
butchering, boiling, or freezing, and we have a
good staff of men. The works are well organised,
even to the lighting of the building by electricity,
Nothing that brains and money can provide is
wanting.” And it is evident that, with a few
organisations throughout the province similar in
character to the Graziers’ Butchering, Meat
Freezing and Export Go., Queensland will have
made a vast step on the highway to prosperity.

intestinal disorders which are so dangerous in
infant life. I recommend Nestle’s Infant Food
from personal experience of its value and con-
venience.” —Prof. Senator.

“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.” —Prof.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical
School, Glasgow, in an entirely voluntary com-
munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, i*
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CuticurA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and ciogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties fiom
CuticurA, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25 c.
with Itching and Burning Eczemas, and other itching,
scaly, and blotchy skin and scalp diseases, are relieved
by a single application, and speedily, permanently, and
economically cured by Cuticura Remedies, the greatest Skin Cures, Blood Purifiers, and
Humor Remedies of modern times. Price: Cuticura, the great Skin Cure, 50 cents, Cuticura
Soap, 25 cents; Cuticura Resolvent, the new Blood Purifier, si,oo. Prepared by Potter Drug
and Chemical Corporation, Boston, U. S. A. All about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and

Our Boy in the West.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The daylight is ending and sunset is blending
In harmonies subtle its crimson and gold.
Our thoughts go in quest where away to the West
there
He left us—dull plodders—and followed the
bold;
We’ve wondered for months how he stands the
hard test—
Oh ! when will we hear from our boy in the West?
He promised us, gaily, “I’ll write something
daily,
And send you the budget whenever I can ;
Though not for the many, the prize is for any
Prepared to bear hardships and grin like a
man ”
Enchanted he joined in the rush with the rest,
A pilgrim who worshipped the wealth of the West.
The daylight is ended —the night has descended
And blotted with blackness the glow from tho
west;
The silence seems longer—a horror grows stronger
And knocks at our hearts like an unbidden
guest—
What secret is hugged to the desert’s dry breast,
Shall we never get news of our boy inthe West?

Wood-splitters about Bendigo (Vic.) use
dynamite to burst stubborn logs. This sometimes
leads to trouble, as when the gable-end was blown
out of the residence of a citizen the other day.
The “ wood-jamber ” had left a plug in an auger-
hole. The local papers had peopled Bendigo with
large, scowling, black browed anarchists before
the truth came out.
Dear Bulletin, — A J.P. and his brother
own a certain smallish station. Five years ago
they employed a Chinaman —a pensive, gold-loving
Johnnie —as shepherd. Perhaps he has received
altogether since his engagement, and so is, or
thinks he is, considerably their creditor. On dark
nights, darker forms spirit away one or more
sheep, and poor Johnnie is too scared to say a
word at the time. When he reports the matter he
is consoled by being informed that the price (not a
drought-price either, you bet) will be debited
against him. So many sheep have been thus
debited against him that he is heavily in the firm’s
debt, and it will take him some six or eight years
to work off the account. The dark forms that
come round at night and lift the sheep are
generally supposed to be the J.P. and his brother.
Please enter the pair for the mean man competi-
tion.—Yours, &c., Tom Gatndah.

Mackennal, the Melbourne modeller, fa-
ther of young Bertram Mac., once gave Garnet
Walch an unexpected treat. They happened to
be strolling by Scots Church, Melbourne, just
when a steeple-jack was fixing the crown-piece
upon the spire of that noble edifice. “ Ah, I’d
like to be up there! I’m afraid I’ll never get so
near to Heaven,” said Walch, gazing cheerfully
at the lofty adventurer. On the instant, Mac-
kennal, who had often tasted this kind of bliss,
and knew the full strength of it, got permission
from contractor David Mitchell (Melba’s papa)
to make the dizzy ascent. Before Walch could
retract his rash enthusiasm, he found himself
clinging to Mackennal on the derrick arrangement,
whilst the pair of them were pulled towards the
sky. In less than no time Walch had attained
the summit of his alleged ambition and felt sorry
he had spoken, for the people in Collins-street
were now as tiny creeping things in his sight and
the pulley chains looked far from strong, he
thought. Heaven had lost its charms for him.
Then the apparatus let them down again, which
is the more awful half of the performance, and
poor G. W. put his foot gingerly upon terra firma
to make sure that he wasn’t treading a distant
cloud. Wiping his careworn countenance with a
trembling handkerchief, the penitent literary man
groaned, “ Never again !” He had been there.

A well-known speculative Melb. solicitor, when
asked to go in for a “good thing," gracefully produces
his cheque-book (City of Melbourne) to show a purchase
of 1000 trains at £7. Total, £7ooo—now worth about
£5OO or so ; and he still holds the scrip. It was J. L.
Dow, former Vic. Minister for Lands, who, during his in-
vestigation in insolvency, remarked to his Honor: “ The
next man who calls on you with a good thing, hit him
with a club.”

The adipose and eminent Southern saint who,
after a 40min. secret interview with a “Sister of Charity,”
(in his most private office), purchased from her a bottle of
eucalyptus oil for what, he thought, was a shilling, has dis-
covered that the price is £200 ! Strange to say, he paid
this price without an audible murmur, after a 10 minutes’
whispered argument with the gentleman who professes to
be “ a looker after the lydy, as it were."

A Melb. auctioneer and estate-agent “broke,”
the other day._ He was an ex-Miyor, a J.P., and a burn-
jng and a shining light in religious circles. In his exam-
ination it transpired that £lOOO, or so, of trust-money
had faded away with the rest of the assets, and the good
man explained the little circumstance, with pious assur-
ance, as follows: “List B of my schedule shows that
about £lOOO is owing by me for rents and premiums
collected. It is owing, I believe, to about 51 creditors. 1
collected those rents as a matter of business—as a com-
mission-agent. So far as these creditors are concerned
this £lOOO is gone. It is gone in business. I did not
spend it on myself. The money went into the bank.
Until the estate has been wound up the creditors have so
far lost it. I can’t say if I have been living on this money
or not for the last two years. It has been mixed up
with other moneys. It was not trust moneys. It was
mine when I collected, and theirs when they got it.
While it was in my custody it was mine. It ceased to be
mine when I paid it away. Up to the moment I paid it
away I did consider it was mine to do what I liked with.
This £lOOO has been paid away with other moneys. The
colony was all upside down, and I thought I could pull
through, but I got left.” The good man’s philosophy is
that the money belonged to its rightful owners “ when
they got it,” and, as he took darned good care they didn’t
get it, it wasn’t theirs. And Victorians see nothing very
remarkable about his creed. Everybody’s money belongs
to anybody who can get hold of it in Melbourne now.
Here is a principle to hold on by. When any
lawyer or agent is paid trust-moneys, he should be held
by law to occupy just exactly the position which is held
hy the bank-teller to whom you pay-in cash. If the teller
pockets the money, that is embezzlement and means
gaol.

In America, no trader ever hopes to get credit
unless he can get his financial position “graded” by
certain inquisitive trade-protection “offices.” The trader
therefore gives his position away voluntarily. The Vic.
representative of one of these offices, trying the same
bluff in Melb. with two firms who never ask credit,
demanded their positions. The reply of one (a very rich
man) was characteristic of him: “I owe nowt, I want
nowt in the way of credit, and you’ll know nowt unless
you are out of here in 10 seconds.” The reply of the
other (also very wealthy) was embodied in a hurried but
impressive flourish of boot-leather.

Che “articles of association ” of many Gympie
pj.) mining companies contain a clause vesting in the
directors an almost limitless power to deal with all un-
allotted or forfeited shares. The usual verbiage of the
clause pnder comment runs like this: “The directors
may cancel such unallotted or forfeited shares in the
reduction of the company's capital, or may allot, sell, or
dispose of them in such way as they may think fit,” &e.
All this without the consent of any non-directorial share-
holders. What a chance for directors, “in the know,”
when an unexpected “ jeweller’s shop ” is struck, after a
run of bad luck and dilatoriness in call-paying, and there
happen to be whips of unallotted and forfeited shares to
be disposed of “as they may think fit 1 ”

The Rev. Xsifct: “ The wrath of God is upon

The Melb. tea-John, in his eagerness for trade,
will give credit to any stranger not living in a slum.
“ You no pay me thisse day ; pay notha time, all lil” says
the Chow, with a winning smile. Sad is the mistake of
him who thinks to “do ” the Celestial hawker by taking
goods on the eve of a flit. John, for the next six months,
in tlie pursuit of his business, hands the name of the
absconder in to all his customers, and into the hands of
every second person he meets, with the query: “You
know him name, bada man? Where him live now?” and
he eventually hunts his debtor down.
• • • *
Dear Bulletin, —Re mine-salting. Why don’t
syndicates employ Chinamen to report on mines before
buying? You can’t put salt on a Chow’s tail. It was in
the fifties. We had just worked out a patch near the
old United States Hotel, Ballarat, when a Chinkie came
to buy. “How much you give, John?” was the first
question. “Me no buy if him no good," was the reply of
the yellow agony, “ but if him middling me give twenty
pong; if him welly good me give forty pong.” I was
deputed to go below and show the pigtail the ground.
John took the wash from different places, mixed it,
filled the bucket and sent it up. We were all lying
smoking when he returned from washing the prospect;
throwing down the dish he said, disgustedly, “No
dam good,” and marched off with a much-injured look.
A burst of laughing from my mates, with a shout “ Done,
by Jove 1” was the reply. They had gone for the forty
and put about 3dwts. into the prospect.—R.L.

Some time ago, Bananaland Ministers were
asked if Government would accept Govt, leases as
security for the issue of debentures in connection with
Central Sugar-mills. No written answer has yet been
supplied to the enquirers, but the Govt, has actually
accepted as part of offered security the leases of some
selections connected with a Central Mill. The value of
the leases is estimated at the value of the improvements,
■plus the amount of the rent paid to date— i.e., at full
value. Now for the boom of hanky-panky.

The epidemic of gold-saving machines shows no
sign of abatement, and the honest miner is lost, in
bewilderment as to the respective merits of 300 patents,
and falls despairingly back upon a set of ripples made in
the old way out of his wife’s jacket and a bit of platypus-
skin. Every machine invented so far has testimonials
signed by a mayor and six aldermen to show that if you
put 3grs. of gold into a ton of dirt and pass it through
the machine you will get out 15dwts. To end indecision
and perplexity there is to be a great patents exhibition
in Sydney about September 14, when Australian mining
and other inventions will be on view. A comprehensive
schedule can be had from Leslie Macarthur, F.Q.S., Union
Bank Chambers, Pitt-street, Sydney.

The real aspect of the silver coinage difficulty
in_ Australia is not generally understood. England now
coins silver—and annexes the profits thereon—both for
herself and for the “colonies.” Australia has the right
to coin silver for local use only, but the local demand is
limited, and the competition of the Imperial mint makes
it more limited still, so that there is hardly enough profit
in view to pay for the required machinery. If Australian
silver could circulate throughout the empire, or if Aus-
tralia could shut out British silver coinage and have a
monopoly of its own market, the business would pay a
handsome profit, but Britain doesn’t “ see her way.”

It has long been a diggers’ dream, despite the
scientific dampers cast on the notion by geologists, that a
payable gold-discovery would be made near Mt. Morgan
(Q.). Dalian’s Knob was in the speculative running for a
long time, and some thousands of pounds sterling went
simply nowhere on its account. Several “Extendeds”
blazed, flickered, and went out. Now, however, if the
wires are to be believed, Scott, M'Laren and party have
made a find about seven miles distant from “ the golden
mountain ” which geologists said was a solitary volcanic
geyser. The warden is said to have granted a reward-
claim. The reef is represented as being from 15in. to
18in. in width, and there are the usual Sinbad-lhe-Sailor
whispers of “ sensational assays.”

The Salendour and the Curse of Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Methought the unknown God we seek in vain
Grew weary of the evil He had wrought—
The piteous litanies of human pain,
Till here and there some lonely souls He
sought
To bear the message of Immortal Thought,
And' sent them forth to wander ’midst the
throng
Crowned with the splendour and the curse of
Song.
But that which still was kindred to the stars
Fought with the flesh and moaned within its
cell,
And beat its wings against its prison bars.
Thus, soaring oft to heights sublime, they
fell,
Dragged by the flesh into the gulfs of Hell,
Till all their days were as a tumult long
Between the splendour and the curse of Song.
Yet oft-times ’mid the fever of distress
Some singers’ lips would chant so sweet a
strain
That storm-tossed souls forgot their weariness,
And comfort crept about the bed of pain,
And men took heart and dreamt of Heaven
again;
And to the weak came hope and courage strong,
Born of the splendour and the curse of Song,
But Life was bitter to the lips that sung ;
And heavier on those souls the curse did grow
Who strove to speak to men an unknown
tongue,
And mournfully their hearts did weigh and
know
The measure of the whole world’s cruel woe,
And wearily they fared Time’s paths along,
Vexed by the splendour and the curse of Song.
Theirs was the homeless hunger of the heart—
Immortal thought within a mortal breast.
Listless they wandered through the crowded
mart.
Who to a careless world had given their best;
And when Death fanned them with his wings
to rest,
What recked they where they slumbered calm
and strong
Crowned with the splendour of Immortal Song!

E. O. Robinson has sold half his interest
in Melville Island (N.T.). The new partners are
going m for buffalo-hunting in real earnest.
A queer custom which prevails at dinners
given by Queen Victoria is the announcement at
the beginning of each course of the name of the
cook who prepared the dishes served.
An interesting record appears in the
visitors -book at the N.S.W. National Art Gallery
in Sydney Domain. The other day the venerable
authoress, Mrs. Louisa A. Meredith, inscribed
her name, with the addition—“ First visit to
Sydney, 1839.”
Harold Boyd, an explosive person well-
known in Australia, has been analysing the
peculiar native gunpowder used in India. This
compound is alleged to be quicker and stronger
than English powder, while it contains neither
nitre, sulphur, nor charcoal. Its name should be
mutiny-made-easy.
The other day the public executioner at
Brussels was called on by the authorities to snip
off someone’s head. At the appointed hour a
stout, middle-aged lady presented herself, and
quietly remarked to the assembled functionaries :
“I’ve eoine for the execution. My husband, the
bourreau, is not well this morning, and asked me
to take his place.” The general stupefaction was
intensified when she added, in a reassuring tone :
“This is not by any means the first time.” How-
ever, the authorities refused to avail themselves
of her offer, and meanly declined to pay her
expenses.
Dear Bulletin;— This is the English of
what my Solomon Island boy tells me: “ Once,
on Noko Island, two shore boys killed a white-
man, a trader. They had to do it because the
Noko chief wanted a white skull for the bow of
his new war canoe, and also because this white
trader had treated some of Noko’s people badly.
Some months after we heard of this, an English
warship came and anchored close to our island—
—Vamoree, with the big native village. An
officer landed and demanded the murderers. Our
chief explained that it was on Noko, and by
Noko’s men, that the trader lost his life; but the
officer said they had shelled Noko village and
were told it was at Vamoree that the Noko mur-
derers were hiding. If the Vamoree chief would
not give them up he would shell Vamoree village.
When the boat left the shore our chief told us to
take what was any good out of the huts and|make
for the mountains. We had scarcely time to get
the women and children out of the village when
the shelling began. Oh, but I am sure those
beautiful copper and brass things must have cost
plenty money, and it was grand fun for us who
had never seen shelling before. When nearly
every habitation had been blown to bits, the man-
of-war steamed away, and we heard the sailors
cheering. Then we went down and looked ait our
village, but we were not very sorry, for we had
such lots of metal for use and ornaments, and we
soon built up the village again. For, master, our
houses were but reeds, and the reeds ever grow.
Moral yourself.—Yours, E.J.B.
TOMMY ARNSTRONG
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The last depressed devil of a Kattiwar
stallion, monotonously swaying to and fro in the
’tween decks with each slow roll of the ship, had
been fed and made much of, and “ dismiss ” from
evening stables had sounded, when Tommy Arm-
strong, trooper of H.M. Canary Bird Dragoon
Guards, told a tale of his youth.
He and his audience camped on the house on
deck, to lee of the upturned longboat, the fore-
royal mast head raking ’mong the stars in Orion’s
belt. For punkah in those hot seas they had the
foot of the bellying mainsail of the chartered
troop-ship Wanderer, bound from Bombay to the
war; for roof the black-blue heavens pierced by
the blazing stars ; for lullaby the swish-swash of
the waves of the Indian Ocean.
The year, the war to which they sailed, these
are matters of no concern.
Tommy, then some 26 years old, was a six-foot,
lathy Victorian centaur, tough as steel. There
was no ramping, rearing, four-legged thing
passed into the regiment, that he refused
to back or failed to sit and tame. As a boxer,
he was the curled darling of his corps, led
out on rare but ever triumphant occasions
to battle with any rampageous “ bullock-
battery man” or swollen “toe-soldier” de-
luded enough to count himself champion bruiser
of Bombay Presidency. Yet, save when directly
challenged, or professionally engaged in serving
God and slaying the Queen’s enemies at eight
annas a day, Tommy was the mildest-mannered
cut-throat conceivable. Snivelling little band-
boys, not robust enough to wash the chrome-
yellow marks off their own necks, spoke of and
to him as —“ Good old Tommy.”
* # •
He was Melbourne-born. His father, a
Yorkshire navvy, had married at eighteen, and
emigrated a year later. Shortly afterwards
Tommy was born. Mr. Armstrong, senior, was a
remarkably fine navvy, drunk or sober. He was
a first-class husband, when not drunk. He was
seldom drunk more than three days a week.
He early acclimatised in Australia the fine old
English habit of kicking his wife when he did not
happen to be quite sober.
To demonstrate his impartiality he “ walloped ”
his only son at all seasons.
“Mother,” explained Tommy, “was a saint.
She had no book-learning, but she knew more of
love and duty and death, and what comes after,
than all the bandy-legged, pot-bellied bishops that
ever I heard tell of. She kept some kind of home
together, good times or bad, was always hard-
working and clean, and thanked Heaven for every
mercy, including the weight of father’s boots.
God bless her and damn him, dead or alive !”
« « *
The lad went early to work. When he
was 13 the problem of life became too intricate for
him.
“So I kissed mother, humped some kind of a
swag, and fetched up at Geelong. A navvy’s
wife, a neighbour who could write a bit, had pro-
mised to send me news of mother from time to
time.”
He got a job—tending horses, milking cows,
and what not, and sent his mother, through the
neighbour, every farthing he possibly could.
• * ' *
When he was rising 18, there came to Gee-
long one who, in his day, had been a png. of;
exceeding fame in England. Some said he was;
the best fighter that ever lived. But he had at
bad, soft, gipsy drop in his blood, and so, to the;
confusion and added profanity of his backers, lost
battles he should have won bruiseless. Under a.
cloud he came to Victoria and invested the pro-
ceeds of the last fight he had sold in a Geelong
pub., in which he retailed cayenne-flavoured kero-
sene and taught aspiring larrikins to spar.
• « •
One evening Tommy, rounding up cows,
found “Jem the Terror,” very drunk, reposing
half in and half out the Barwon, the river rising
and very angry. Strong as the stock-horse he
rode, the lad, at no small personal risk, fished Jem
out and bore him, dripping but cheerful, to his
native pub. Arrived, Jem pulled himself to-
gether.
“Young Tommy Armstrong, ain’t it? You
come round ter-morrow. I’ll not forget you.”
The youngster refused all offers of liquid enter-
tainment, but called the following evening.
Jem, fairly sober, swore the lad had saved his

life, offered him a J55-note, and solemnly made
him free of the kerosene-bottle for the term of his
natural life.
“I want none of your money,” said Tommy,
“and I don’t drink—seen enough of that.”
“Then what the devil do ye want?” enquired
the naturally surprised bruiser.
“To learn to fight—to fight proper. Will you
teach me ? I can’t pay much, because of motner.
I’ll pay what I can, though.”
The man looked hard at him. “Come in here,”
he said.
He led Tommy into an inner room where there
were dumb-bells and a few seta of dirty boxing-
gloves.
“ You’re the Armstrong who’s always scrapping,
ain’t you?”
“Yes.”
Though, in a general way, the least aggressive
youngster in Sleepy Hollow, he had, with the
equable air of a philosopher essaying physiological
problems, fought every human fighting thing in
his neighbourhood. He generally won. If de-
feated, the victor had to meet Tommy again and
again until the position was reversed. He ex-
plained that he “ fought for information, as it
were.”
“Strip to the waist,” ordered Jem. Tommy
peeled and stood there, a model of condition and
muscular development. The old fighter looked
him over, measured his chest, kneaded his muscles.
“Shove on your flannel and fit these mittens
on.”
For the next ten minutes there were sounds as
of revelry by night. Jem, in aldermanic condi-
tion, needed all his science to impress Tommy
with a needful sense of inferiority. The lad’s box-
ing was rudimentary. His coolness, quickness,
insensibility to punishment, length of reach, and
soundness of wind were phenomenal.
“Fight!” said Jem, wiping his damp and bull-
doggy face, “ Fight 1 By God, in twelve months,
if you listen to me, I’ll have you fit to whip any
man in Australia.”
“ I only want to whip one," replied the other.
“Who’s he?”
“ I’ll tell you when I’ve pounded him.”
* # •
Jem, moved thereto partly by gratitude,
partly by admiration for the younger man’s pluck
and straightforwardness, and greatly by the desire
to foster and bet on so promising a novice, made
Tommy an offer. The latter was to help run the
grog-shop, to keep Jem as sober as his natural
gravitation to jim-jams would permit, and to look
after the crapulous bruiser when “ delicious tri-
angles ” actually overtook him. In return,
Tommy was to be paid for his services and receive
all the instruction in boxing and training his
queer patron could impart.
Both stood loyally to their contract, the nature
of which was kept secret from a too inquisitive
public.
• * •
When Tommy was 20, Jem admitted he
could teach him no more. Then the former
thought he would go home, if only to keep the
“ old man ”in order. His father had not seen
him for seven years. But Tommy, who every
now and again had surreptitiously visited his
mother, had made it his business to see the senior
Armstrong often from afar. Ho had ki.pt the
elder man’s face and figure green in his memory.
This possibly was due to filial affection.
His determination to go home came a trifle late.
One night, shortly thereafter, Mr. Armstrong,
senior, returned even drunker and more savage
than usual. To emphasise his discontent he
knocked his wife down,
Unfortunately, or the reverse, she failed to rise
with respectful celerity. Mr. Armstrong pro-
ceeded to punish her “ blarsted obstinacy” by
kicking her. He kicked once too often. Three
days later she died, after solemnly affirming to
the enquiring authorities that she had kicked
herself to death in an epileptic fit during the
absence of her loving spouse. There was no evi-
dence against the latter, who celebrated her demise
by a particularly royal and protracted drunk.
Tommy’s mother had been buried four days
when he, through the friendly neighbour, heard of
her decease and the circumstances thereof. He
set off at once for Melbourne, to find the ancestral
shanty swept and garnished. His father was
gone—none knew where.
• * *
Tommy went back straight to Geelong.
His face was set and greyish white.
His big paws moved curiously. He
declared to Jem his intention of
changing the scene —of view-
ing the world.
Jem, reflecting on the
science of his pupil, was
savage. It spoke volumes
for his real goodness that,
seeing Tommy was in trouble
and in earnest, he forebore
utterance of embellished con-
demnation.
“Anyway, you’re
white, Tommy,” and
he tendered the con-
tents, by no means
poverty-stricken, of the till.
These the young fellow declined, but he gripped
the master’s hand in a manner which satisfied the
latter alike of the neophyte’s muscularity and
appreciation.
• • •
Young Armstrong then commenced a pil-
grimage, wandering, with no apparent purpose,
through Victoria, and working as a navvy, but as
nothing else, whenever such work offered.
One day he struck Ballarat. It was winter. A
big gang of navvies were making streets, but many
were unemployed. Times were bad. A friendly
ganger made room, however, for Tommy.
He had worked for tome days when, one
#6«y«4|r;
morning, a huge stranger in moleskins strolled
up and stood watching him with a scowl.
When Tommy saw him, a queer look came about
his mouth ; he stuck his pick in the bank and
steadily regarded the other.
The stranger, a man Ja little over 40, was of
Herculean build and weather-marked, but his face
was pale and pinched with the pallor and sham
ness of hunger; the strap round his waist wo
tight drawn, and the pipe in his hat-band scarce
sullied with smoke.
“Want a job?” said Tommy. “You bet,”
grunted the stranger. The former fished out some
silver from the bag hung round his sinewy throat:
“Here, take this. Get tucker and beer. Come
back in the afternoon and you shall have my plaqp.
“ Big Yorkie’s heels were describing mathematical
figures in mid-air .”
I’m leavin’.” The elder man scowled a sort of
thanks, and went.
Tommy persuaded the friendly ganger to give
the stranger his place on the work, the more
easily because the elder man turned out to be
‘‘Big Yorkie,” whose fame as a navvy was all
over the land.
Two weeks after, on a Monday morning early,
“Big Yorkie,” glancing up, saw Tommy intently
watching him.
“Dost want tha place again?’’ said the elder
man, “because I’ll see tha damned first.”
“Do you know me?” enquired Tommy, very
softly.
Something in the young fellow’s intonation
caused Big Yorkie to scrutinise him carefully.
“ Ay, b':t * ver!' he sc a Wed at last.
V Jiuig Vu. .. strode over and struck the
elder in in hard in the face with his open hand,
II is fingers left livid weals on the sun tanned
cheek.
I’ig Yorkie sprung out of the hole he stood in,
w At. the roar of an an ,ry beast. He frothed at
th. mouth and tore his flannel off.
In ten seconds a hundred men had gathered and
formed a ring. The position was extremely sim-
ple. There was to be a fight. Both men were
very strong; both looked sufficiently evil. It
would be a good fight.
It was —for a certain time.
Yorkie was the taller and heavier of the two,
but a trifle old and stale. Tommy’s condition
would have made Jem weep with joy.
Someone called “ Time !” Then Yorkie sprang
at Tommy with such savagery and strength and
rained such blows upon him that the latter, taken
by surprise, and catching his foot against a stone,
went down, covered with blood.
Yorkie rushed forward and lifted one of his
feet, cased in navvy’s highlows, to kick his fallen
foe on the head.
A dozen strong arms hauled the brute back.
Tommy rose with a sweet smile. “I like a
little punching first round,” he exclaimed. “It
steadies me.”
The proceedings for the next ten minutes were
animated but not, from a pugilistic point of view,
highly interesting. Tommy played with his foe
as a cat with a mouse, and, when tired of play,
knocked him down. Seven times he felled him.
At last Yorkie, bruised, battered and bloody,
pu led himself together, rather cleverly dodged a
blow and closed with the younger man and
gripped him.
This was precisely what Tom’s backers—for all
men take sides in a fight—feared. They felt that
in close-quarters the weight, reach and greater
power of Big Yorkie must infallibly tell.
Thirty seconds later Big Yorkie’s heels were
describing mathematical figures in mid-air. Ten
minutes subsequently he was being carried to
hospital with most of his ribs broken, one leg
badly fractured and something curious and
surgically scientific the matter with his skull.

“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whiles and the natives in these faraway
parts.* A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those'who arc fond of
realistic•work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of thl; is that
he has, hy many years’experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best'work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sidney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc hero and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in ‘ Spirit Led,' which the great American might have written. ‘ A Cup of Cold Water’ is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to purely Australian literature.”— Daily Telegraph,
July 15, 1893.
“ ‘The Last of Six ;’ and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15, 1893.
