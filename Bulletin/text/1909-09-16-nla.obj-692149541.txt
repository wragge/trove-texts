INDIGESTION, DYSPEPSIA, and other
stomach troubles are generally caused by lack of
Pepsin in the Digestive Organs. The most
stubborn cases of Indigestion, etc., have been
found to yield to treatment by Langebek’s Pepsin
Extract.
This preparation is a scientific product, and is
prescribed by medical men throughout the world.
The Medical Press of Europe is unanimous in
asserting Langebek’s to be the best Pepsin
Extract on the market. The British Medical
Journal says: “It possesses a much higher
digesting power than the ordinary form of
Pepsin.”

SONG.
Love, love me only,
Love me for ever ;
My life’s been lonely,
A joyless endeavor.
Though earth were Heaven,
I in it for ever,
Of thee bereaven—
I’d love again neyer.
AT JULIET’S TOMB.
This fair woman who is dead
(Sung so sweet of long ago)
Lies not in a mortal bed —
Song has made her couch to grow
With all sweet things, as they stir
Like unfading growths that cling
In an everlasting spring
Round her Poet’s dream of her.
Time is dead—she has not died !
All the light of beauty stays.
As if the sweet lips replied
To whate’er her lover says
O’er the tomb to her, as he
Fingers her undying hair ;
Such is death when Lovfe is there,
Love that lives in poesv.
(Prom R. Crawford’s Lyric Moods.)
Novels by Women
WHEN “George Eliot ’’and “Currer
Bell” put forth their works, half a
century ago, novels by women
were rare phenomena, and so unpalatable
to men that these authors endeavored to
disguise their sex. It is no longer neces-
sary to do that. The number of female
authors trading under their own names is
equal to that of men. And women hold
the record for best circulations. Every
brand of fiction is supplied by them. If
you want salacious suggestion, there is
Victoria Gross ; vulgar frivolity—Elinor
Glyn ; purpose and propriety—Mrs. Hum-
phrey Ward ; soapsuds and sugar—Marie
Corelli. Good detective stories are pro-
vided by Anna K. Green and L. Lynch;
romance, mystery, historical and \ psy-
chological novels by scores of women who
handle'their pens as capably as the aver-
age man. And if you want “ the virile
note,” they can give it to you. An Ameri-
can magazine, in reviewing Miss “G. B.
Lancaster’s ” novel —Tice Tracks We Tread
—gave it special praise for its virility,
* * * *
Amongst recent novels by women which
we have read, The lu/amous John Friend ,
by Mrs. Garnett (Sydney Book Club), is
the strongest and best. Friend is an
unusual character—a spy who as will-
ingly served Napoleon as Bitt, without
conscience or honor in the conventional
sense, and yet was an ideal husband and
a brave man. The lights and shades of such
a complex character are not as delicately
drawn as they would be in a novel by
Henry James; nevertheless, the man
commands attention from the beginning,
and gains the reader’s admiration as he
did that of the two women in the story,
by virtue of his manliness. There is no
squeamishness about Mrs. Garnett, nor
any straining after effect. The story is
carefully planned, the action is vigorous
and natural. If this book had been pub-
lished anonymously it might easily have
been mistaken for the work of a man
an able man.
On the same principle it is not safe to
assume that The Inner Shrine (Dymock),
which is published anonymously, was
written by a woman. It has all the
indications of a woman’s hand in its por-
traiture of men, and in general features
it belongs to the family of the late
Augusta Evans Wilson. The style, how-
ever, is superior to that of Infelice and its
sisters, and at times reminds the reader
of Edith Wharton. It has made a great
stir in America, and guesses at the
authorship have been “featured” by
some of the papers. Why anyone should
worry over it is hard to understand, for
there is no illusion of reality as in the
case of the Englishwoman's Love Letters,
and the story is just a littfe above the
ordinary.
Elinor Lane’s Katrine (Angus and
Robertson) was published just before her
death this year. It is on the old estab-
lished lines and as well written as Nancy
Stair, though lacking the interest which
the portrait of Burns gave to that book.
Like The Inner Shrine, its action is in
America and France, and it is also a tale
of love and sacrifice—but in many re-
spects a better one. When Katrine’s
lover leaves her she remembers a line she
had read somewhere—“ No great artistic
success ever came to a woman that had
not its root in a dead love.’ 5 Dead or
starved sex emotions account for many
good novels by women; and the prolific
lady novelist does not, as a rule, have
many children. Nature keeps the bal-
ance even.
Grace Donworth’s Letters of Jennie Allen
to her friend, Miss Musgrove (G. Robertson
<fc Ob.) do not maintain any illusion of
reality. They are letters in name only ;
but they serve to hold the humorous
remarks of a short and stout variant of
Mrs. Wiggs, and the humor is aided by
spelling which is a cross between Artemus
Ward’s and G. B. Shaw’s. Jennie has a
marvellous memory, and repeats all the
good things said by her acquaintances,
especially Mr. Spinney, who is “ 2
floors up, and when the young ones is
carrying on very partickler, he comes in
and says, ‘Playing tennis, kids, ain’t yer?
I thought I heard the racket.’” .. . “ Jim
was saying that if Roosevelt hadn’t done
nothing else for us he’d contributed two
immortal sayings to our language—the
strenerous life being one, and a houseful
of happy children the other. Put ’em
together, says Mr. Spinney, for it’s all
one saying.” . . . “ Mandy sticks too close
to the rule, and one morning when she
was cooking some tappy ochre pudding
and for all there was a sight of work to
be done, she squnched right down on a
chair by the stove and dident move a
mussel till Mame called out, ‘ Are you
taking your night’s rest in advants?’
Then she says, ‘No, I am simply foller-
ing the directions of the bo.ok : ‘ Do not
stir while it is boiling.’” . . . But when
Jennie Allen mentions in a letter that
“ Mr. Spinney says there is in her voice
the reverberations of far-off drawing-’
rooms,” the authoress betrays a lack of
proportion.
There is art and humor in The Actress,
by Louise C. Hale (Dymock), a story
which bears every trace of truth to life.
It is brightly told and well worth reading.
Of the rest, mention must he made of The
Veil,hj E. S. Stevens, a story of Northern
Africa, in which the glamor of oriental
life is as well realised as in Hichens’ The
Garden of Allah.
Australia’s First Laureate
In the year 1819 Mr. Barron Field, Judge
of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,
published in Sydney a booklet entitled First
Fruits of Australian Poetry, with a motto
adapted from Bishop Hall:
I first adventure. Follow me who list,
And be the second Austral harmonist.
The light of Charles Lamb’s fame fell upon
Barron Field, whose booklet he reviewed in
the Examiner, and to whom he addressed a
letter, reprinted in the Essays; otherwise
Field’s own literary ventures would not have
saved him from slipping into oblivion long
ago. The contents of this booklet are not
poetry, and they are not Australia’s first
fruits in the versicle department. Field
deliberately ignored the prior claim of
Michael Massey Robinson, the transported
attorney, who must have been as well
known in the community as Field himself,
and who at times sat beneath his Honor
as Clerk of the Court. In January of the
same year, 1819, an Ode on the Queen’s
Birthday, by M.R., was printed in the
Sydney Gazette, and was reprinted as a broad-
side, three pages folio. (Curiously enough
there was then no Queen in England,
as Charlotte had died in 1818 ; but it took
six months for news to get round the world
in those days.) And odes of a similar char-
acter had been printed, circulated as broad-
sides, and recited at the Governor’s levees
since 1810.
Michael Robinson was an attorney of some
standing in England, who for some reason or
other departed from his legitimate means of
bleeding the public, and wrote letters to
various comfortable persons threatening to
ipcuse them of sundry crimes if they failed
to hand over money. A clever lawyer could
no doubt have carried on the game of
blackmail with some success if he had
picked his men carefully; but Robinson
happened to bump against a snag in
the shape of ‘ c that respectable magistrate
Mr. Oldham Oldham—Deputy Judge Advo-
cate-General of England.” He intimated to
the worthy Deputy that a charge of murder
would be made against him if a large sum of
money were not forthcoming ; whereupon
the said Deputy caused the before-mentioned
gent one, etc., to be arrested. The trial is
reported to have been a memorable one.
Robinson was sentenced to death ; but at
Oldham’s request he was given Botany Bay
instead.
A letter from Sydney, printed in Hie True
Briton in October, 1799, refers to Robin-
son’s arrival in the ship “ Barwell,” and men-
tions that he had quickly ingratiated himself
with the authorities on the ship, aided them
against the other convicts who mutinied
after leaving the Cape, and a fortnight after
his arrival in Sydney had been appointed
secretary to the Judge Advocate and granted
a conditional pardon. Robinson also wrote to
England, and his letter seems to have been
published in some newspaper, as the pardon
came to the knowledge of Oldham. Think-
ing that Robinson might be able to return
to England, where he had no wish to see
him, Oldham stirred up the Duke of Port-
land, who gave a casual glance at the affairs
of New South Wales on behalf of his
Majesty’s Government, and a letter was
written to the Governor here reminding him
that Robinson had been sent out for the
term of his natural life and must not return.
SI?
Robinson’s literary gifts were displayed
soon after his arrival, for in addition to his
letter to the newspaper he wrote an address
to be spoken by Mrs. Parry at the Sydney
Theatre, which had-been erected by convicts
in 1798. (The first theatrical performance
was in a hut, June, 1789.) The London
Sporting Magazine or Monthly Calendar for
April, 1801, printed the programme for the
Ist June, 1799, when “ Fortune’s Fool ” was
presented, followed by the “ new occasional
address” by Robinson, and “Bon Ton.”
“ Who knows but the drama and the stage
may yet derive support from this colony ? ”
said the Sporting Magazine. “We need
scarcely add that at the enchanting repre-
sentation mentioned below all the spectators
were transported ! ” The Obvious gaped and
the little sporting writer walked in.
We do not hear of Robinson again until
1802, when he was convicted of wilful and
corrupt perjury, and sentenced to hard labor
on Norfolk Island for seven years. He had
not been long on the island before his
quality as an Artful Smooger secured him
release from confinement and an easy
clerical position. He quickly found that
he could turn his gifts to advantage
by forging permits for convicts. Perhaps
he was clumsy, or perhaps luck was
against him—anyhow, he was found out,
struck off the rolls by the Bench, and sent
back to chains again. While on the
Island he wrote some loyal odes and kept a
diary. Extracts from the diary relating to
one of the earliest bushrangers, a negro
named Julius Csesar, were printed in The
Bulletin by “Price Warung” (20/8/’92).
The sentence to Norfolk Island would not
expire until 1809, but we find that Robinson
got back to Sydney much earlier than that,
as a letter from D’Arcy Wentworth to Capt.
Piper is printed in the Historical Records,
reporting that Robinson had arrived in
Sydney a close prisoner, and suggesting that
Governor King would not be obliged to Piper
for sending him back. What King said or
did does not appear ; but he left Sydney in
1806. At the end of 1809 Macquarie arrived,
and quickly showed that he was very much
in favor of encouraging the emancipists;
Whether Robinson met him with an Ode
of Welcome on arrival is not known, but a
Loyal Ode to the King written by the gifted
Michael was recited at the Governor’s first
levee, and in April, 1810, Robinson was
appointed first clerk in the Secretary ’s office,
a lucrative position even in those days. A
copy of an “ Ode for the Ist January, 1811,
inscribed to Governor Macquarie,” has been
preserved, and is in the Mitchell Libi’ary.
It is printed on a proof slip, and the follow-
ing sample will give an idea of the style :
As long as Arts and Arms prevail
Thy Name shall flourish in the Tide
Of Ages yet unknown.
Fame shall record what Thou hast done :
Exulting, claim Thee for her son
And mark Thee for her own.
SI/
This sort of thing touched Macquarie
where he lived. That amiable and able man
was not without the hope thkt his 'name
would flourish in the Tide of Ages, and he
gave Fame a little help by causing the Name
to be carved on numerous public buildings
and affixed to a great many geographical
features. His taste in poetry was probably
simple, and as Robinson’s verse was near
enough in style to that of Gray and Gold-
smith to pass muster, he may have believed
that if all felso failed his name and deeds
would live in Robinson’s noble numbers.
During the whole of Macquarie’s long
administration the ex-convict basked in the
sunshine of Tice-regal favor. He sterns to
have abandoned his bad practices altogether,
restrained his facile pen from writing other
people’s names, and turned it to the less
disastrous task of emulating the oriental
bards in the obsequiousness of his ad-
dresses to the King, Queen and Governor
Macquarie. Some of these productions ap-
peared in The Sydney Gazette ; others were
printed as broadsides, and distributed “with
the author’s compliments ” amongst the
aristocracy of New South Wales. From his
“Ode for the Queen’s Birthday, 1816,” we
take a passage referring to the recent ex-
ploration beyond the Blue Mountains which
shows Robinson at his best:
Ere yet their tasks the sturdy swains began,
Invaded Nature, startled at the plan.
On the wonder gaz’d, when Human Art appear’d
To burst thro’ bounds in untrac’d Ages reared :
But when they brav’d the Noon-tide’s sultry ray
Scal’d the steep Cliff, and pierc’d the pathless Way,
Taught the reluctant, stubborn glebe to yield,
And in the Desart sprung the cultured field—
She shar’d their triumph, and with libera] smile
Disclos’d the rich resources of the soil.
An advertisement appeared in The Hobart
Town Gazette of 23rd March, 1822, and was
copied into The Sydney Gazette, stating that
“A volume of Royal Birthday Odes written
in N.S.W. and recited at the levees at
Government House, Sydney, 1810-1821,
with some other before-unpublished pieces
by Michael Robinson would be published in
a volume handsomely bound. Price £1 each
copy.” If such a volume was published no
copy of it is known to be in existence at the
present time.
Robinson was Principal Clerk to the Secre-
tary for the Colony—John Thomas Campbell
—and Clerk to the High Court of Appeals
and Vice-Admiralty Court until 1820, when
he became Deputy Provost Marshal. On the
Bth February, 1822, his lines on the birthday
of Macquarie were printed in The Sydney
Gazette. From 1823 to 1826 his name appears
in Howe’s Almanaclcs as Principal Clerk in
the Police Office.
Beyond this date we have not traced ,the
career of Michael Massey Robinson. In-
dustrious students of our early history may
discover that Australia’s first Laureate be-
came a pillar of the Church. And probably
“when they buried him,” to quote the words
of another Laureate, “the little port had
seldom seen a costlier funeral.”
* ■
R. Ci'awford publishes a volume called
Lyric Moods (T. 0. Lothian), with a blank
verse proem in which he claims to be a poet,
and the only one he has known. Let us set
forth this claim in his own words, together
with his remarks about the presumptuous
newspaper persons who review books.
I have not known a poet but myself,
If I’m indeed one, as I ought to be,
Considering how these many years I’ve made
The Muse now such a woman in my life.
No flesh and blood could put to proof the art
With which I wooed her; ay, and woo her still,
Though, as I deem, ere this she has been won.
I have not known another, as I say,
Who could,lie called a poet, or has been
Acclaimed such by the not too wise in wit
Who label literature’s itinerants —
Professed discerners (as in every art
With sheer cock-surety there be those who
Deem their diploma Fame’s own warranty);
Who in this journal or in that take stock
O’ the issue of thoughts’s making—song at best
A poor result, not to much tending (or if
Esteemed, good, e’en though flawed in some way
still).
So these crumb-gatherers for the multitude
Still dole their wit or wisdom week by week. . . .
The present reviewer, without being cock-
sure, inclines to the belief that R. Crawford’s
experience is not an uncommon one. Quite
a number of writers of respectable verse are
satisfied about their own right to the title of
poet, and know no one else with equal
claims. But not many of them would have
the courage to say so in the forefront of their
publications.
Reviewing is largely a matter of recording
personal impressions. There is no infallible
" ‘Sting instrument for poetry, like that which
me milk inspector carries round. It must be
tried on the palate, as the tea men try their
decoctions. And poetry which is the real
thing finds the right palates eventually, even
in the teeth of opposition from a chorus of
indolent reviewers. Crawford prints two
impressions of the quality of his wares at the
back of his bdok. Our own opinion is that
there is nothing in it equal to Wordsworth
in delicacy and charm, nor superior to Henley
in quality ; but there are a dozen pieces
which are very good minor verse, and we
extract two of them. Crawford’s Lyric
Moods are not always lyrical. He has
emptied scraps of blank verse from his note
books into the volume, and his blank verse
has no distinction. Crawford at his best is
graceful and attractive, and a rigorous selec-
tion of his lyrics would make a better appeal
to the public. There is no indication in this
book that a collection with the same title
was published by the author in 1904.

Debility, Indigestion
and Palpitation.
A COMPLETE CURE.
By perusing the following story, the reader will
be made acquainted with circumstances that pos-
sibly bear a personal resemblance, in which event
gratefulness would be felt towards Mrs. Josephine
Mack, of No. 21 Parsons Street, Balmain, for
placing on record her remarkable experience.
Answering the reporter’s first' question Mrs.
Mack said :
“As a sufferer from debility and indigestion, I
ought to be able to speak with authority on the
subject of what is the most effective remedy for
such afflictions, and the knowledge I gained in this
respect came through following the example of 9,
relative, who had been suffering like myself, and
who was quite restored to health by Clements
Tonic.”
“Had you been ailing long, Mrs. Mack?”
“Yes, too long for mjAliking, and a weary time
it was, too. I had trie*many alleged remedies,
and only wasted my money in doing so. Need-
less to say how despondent I was as a result. I
had no strength to get about, and the easiest work
in the house was often too much for me. Yes,
anybody around here can tell you what I was like
then, for I have been in this house for the past
eleven years and am pretty well known. Ah !
little did I think of the misery that was in store
for me when I was a healthy, young woman,
teaching at a school in Tipperary. But we never
know what is before us. Why, my life became a
positive burden to me. I was subject to reeling
sensations. I would feel myself swaying to and
fro, and it required a big effort to save myself from
falling to the floor. The severest form of head-
aches attacked me, and I was terribly nervous,
too, and when nervousness hinges on to a woman
her unhappiness is complete. The terrifying
thoughts that come to the brain, such as strange
sounds being present, making the belief that
somebody is stealthily moving about the room, or
a window being raised in the dead of night, are
enough to distract a person entirely. And in the
fretful state of mind then ruling every little
trouble was magnified into an impassable mountain
of adversity. Very often I would go and lie down,
quite unable to keep up any longer, and I don’t
know what would have happened only for the
Qlements Tonic that I fortunately started taking
in time.”
“ Did your illness entail any difference in your
weight ? ”
“My word, it did; but it was astonishing how
soon it came back once I had got properly going
with Clements Tonic, which seemed to make the re-
moval of my afflictions quite easy. Before this, 1
hadn’t any prospect of getting my strength back,
for I could not eat, and a person cannot do much
good without an appetite. But the trouble was
that when I did force myself to eat, I suffered
fearfully from indigestion—heavy sensations in
the chest, such as made the very act of breathing
a difficulty, and pains under my shoulders, across
my back, and aches in my limbs that were most
wearisome. My heart palpitated dreadfully, and
there were pains in the region of that organ, too.
So you see, I was altogether in a bad way. But,
thank God, there is a very marked difference in
my physical condition between now and then, and
I have to give all the credit to the remedy I’ve
already mentioned. The derangements of my
nervous system, that had obstinately remained in
existence until Clements Tonic was brought into
requisition, do not trouble me now, neither do any
of the disorders that had proved so wearisome.
By judiciously keeping to my newly-won friend,
Clements Tonic, I succeeded in regaining the
priceless gift of good, robust health, and it is only
fair that I should give to that remedy all the
credit that is due to it. As a nerve tonic, to
brace a woman up, and make her feel invulner-
able against the hardest work and the severest
trials that happen during one’s course through
life, I recommend Clements Tonic. It not only
cured my indigestion, but also supplied in unstint-
ed measure nerve force and strength, which gives
a woman confidence in herself, and to the weak
and sickly I shall always advise the use of that
grand preparation.”
“ Your views will be duly chronicled.”
“Very well, you are at liberty to publish them
where and how you think best for the benefit of the
whole community.”

WALTER HARRIS OF WHOM THE
STORY IS TOLD
The story which mothers tell
of children saved from sick-
ness and suffering- by SCOTT’S
Emulsion is a long- and
continually increasing one.
Mrs. W. Harris, 50 Mary
Street, Waterloo, Sydney,
N.S.W., writes (10/6 08»: “My
son Walter, aged 2, was
suffering from a severe cold,
and had lost the use of his
voice. I gave him SCOTT’S
Emulsion, and he was quite
cured after the first bottle,
and he is now as well and
strong as ever.” The intense
curative force which enables
SCOTT’S to achieve such cures
is not to be found in any
other emulsion, and this is
why SCOTT’S alone possesses
such a magnificent record
of success.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Man Who Was Making Good.
He turned his back upon the bad old days—
Upon the bad old nights as well;
And never more he walked the crimson ways
That lead to the front door of Hell.
The midnight orgie and the hansom cab—
The girls and wine and cigarettes ;
He had interred them ’neath a marble slab
Along with all his old bad debts ;
And when thin females came to him, all hab-
Itated in holy saws and garments drab,
He shunned them and their pious nets.
In time the spectres of ancestral souls
Fell on him in a ghostly mob!
(Heredity’s dark tide for ever rolls
Down ways that lead towards Satan’s hob).
And thus it was. The dead men leapt on him
Whereof this history I write ;
He fought the devils, old and horned and dim,
Which rose and clamored in the night!
Till saints came sloping round with prayer and
hymn—
And idle talk of thrones and cherubim,
He fought the long and cheerless fight !
But when the preachers came to reinforce
The ’sieging imps of yesteryear ;
When parsons rose, with voices drear and hoarse,
To preach the sinfulness of beer —
’Twas then he fell back in the mud once more—
Deep down into the very dregs.
He drank as he had done in days of yore,
With all the very baddest eggs !
He leaped upon his hat and sinned and swore—
He lied and stole and fought, and furthermore
Bought rum wholesale in kegs.
Which goes to show how helpful it would be
Were saints and parsons sometimes dumb ;
The devils of one’s private ancestry
Are bad enough, but when these come—
When curate folk and deacons sleek arise—
As pious persons think they should ;
Sometimes they merely help to sacrifice
A man whose ways and habits, otherwise,
Might have been moderately good !
VICTORIA.
GRANT HERVEY.
’Berra, the City of Dreadful Skite.
Have you read of a marvellous City
Away in the Ewigkeit —
A noble and beautiful City
Of which the newspapers write ?
It is ringed with majestic mountains
Where a hundred glaciers gleam,
And from them a thousand fountains
Flow down in a mighty stream !
Upborne on those cloud-capped shoulders
The eternal snowfields rest;
They strike with awe the beholders
Who gaze on each dazzling crest!
And over those vast white ranges,
In kaleidoscopic tints,
The daylight shifts and changes—
So the Morning Herald prints.
Far, far at their feet unfurling.
The green plains stretch away
Beyond the horizon, curling
To broad, blue Jervis Bay—
The plains that laugh with a fatness
Of wheat and cattle and maize !
So at least, with remarkable patness,
The Daily Telegraph says.
There garden and orchard glisten
In richness past all words,
And you hear— if you stop to listen —
The song of rejoicing birds !
And the forests are filled with timber,
And there do the wild bards muse
In droves. Thus do I remember
It was told in the Evening News.
Wherever are rocks or boulders
The precious metals are found—
It simply staggers beholders
To note the wealth around !
Here gems show their tinted glories,
There a gold vein winds and climbs—
At least so run the stories
That I read in the Sunday Times.
And over this fairy region
Of mountains and fertile plains,
And rivulets—which are legion—
A heavenly climate reigns !
Calm, equable, clear and bracing,
No blistering droughts are there ;
Nor bitter westerlies racing—
So do the papers declare.
There never the bush-fire rages ;
There seasons are always kind ;
There never the settler wages
Long war with flood and wind ;
There never are found those scourges,
The worm and the flying blight—
At least, so Gregory urges.
And Gregory’s always right!
And then the streets of that City
That is to be one day built,
Though not gold —which is really a pity
At least will be richly gilt 1
The houses will be of marble.
With roofs and doors of gold—
That is if the News doesn’t garble
The tale that we are told.
This perfect spot, in a spirit
Of God-like sacrifice
Which must earn them eternal merit,
They give to us—at a price.
Yea ! this place transcendental
In beauty, wealth and health,
Shall be City Continental
Of a thankless Commonwealth !

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would, oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advert De-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor. Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

lishers. The right, to reproduce or translate any part of

for return it will be understood that the copy is to be

SYDNEY, REGARDED AS THE MIS-
FORTUNE OF N.S.W.
But we contend that the broadest possible view must
be taken where the navy is concerned. There can he no
room for city jealousies or for party squabblings when the
fate of the Commonwealth is at stake, and the navy is
our all in all. Whatever tends to impair its efficiency in the
present, or to prejudice its prospects in the future, must
be considered as a blow at the heart, and in the contract
which has been entered into with the mother country it
is essential that there shall be no mistakes in organisa-
tion or failures to do the best possible with the means at
our disposal. Nothing can alter the fact that in
•Sybney Harbor the Commonwealth possesses an ideal
.naval station. ... Why should Melbourne be con-
sidered ?. .. It behoves the Minister for Defence to make
■up his mind on the matter of naval dockyards and ship-
building-. The Admiralty has never hesitated. Melbourne
unay have insisted that its advantages were equal to those
•of Sydney, but Garden Island is the reply, and to begin to
■discuss Newport in such connection is to turn an accepted
(policy upside down. —S. M. Herald.
At different times in recent years it has been de-
manded that Sydney should be the capital of
Australia, or at least that the capital should
'be as near to that city as possible. It has
'been demanded that all Federal postage stamps
■should be printed in Sydney—it was shown
'that that kind of work was done more
'cheaply in Adelaide, but raving parochialists
•proposed that N.S. W. should secede and burst up
'the Commonwealth unless the petty job came to
•Sydney. Further, there is a demand to-day that
'the transcontinental railway should be turned into
'a sort of coastal line in order to bring it to
•Sydney ; that all war-vessels which may be con-
•structed in Australia should be built at Sydney ;
that the Australian naval station should be per-
manently at Sydney whether the pressure of com-
merce leaves room for it or not; and that the
'naval docks, repairing shops, cannon foundries,
•arms factories, etc., should be in Sydney or as
liear there as possible. And this is in addition
to the fact that all the N.S.W. State railways
converge on Sydney; that special rates are
granted in order to drag every possible scrap of
commerce there ; and that the State Parliament,
law courts, Government offices, etc., are at the
same old congested spot.
* « • •
The S. M. Herald, while thus clamoring to
congest almost everything that N.S.W. or Aus-
tralia possesses to its own office door, handy to its
circulation and its advertising business and its
profits, declares that “the broadest possible view
must be taken.” That is true, but the Herald’s
own view is pitifully narrow; and if it were not
that people recognise it to be the result of
ignorance, parochialism, incapacity, parish-
mindedness and old convict-time prejudice, they
might be tempted to go further and call it an
evidence of corruption. The idea of sacrificing
the naval prospects and chances of Australia for
the sake of bringing one more job to the city
where the S. M. Herald’s office is located, is
only in keeping with the entire policy of the
Herald and most of its city contemporaries ;
yet the fact that it is only part of the
old policy doesn’t make it any less shocking
and degrading. Among all the countries '
which have large naval experience it is
known and recognised that a naval port should be
a thing apart—that there must be room on land
for works of all sorts; and abundant room for
ships on the water, without running down ferry
boats and without being hampered by steamers,
ships, brigs, barques, barquentines, yawls,
ketches and all manner of mercantile etceteras J
and that it is sheer folly to have all the country’s
naval preparations open to the view of every Ger-
man, Jap, Russian or other foreigner and pos-
sible enemy who happens to bring a ship loaded
with turnips into the harbor. Therefore Britain
has its naval headquarters at places like Ports-
mouth and Devonport; the U.S. at Newport,
Charleston and Key West; Austria at Pola;
France at Cherbourg, Brest, Lorient, Rochefort,
etc.; Germany at Wilhelmshaven, and similar
non-commercial centres. Among the people who
have had real naval experience and who Know
Things it is the fixed rule to keep the
naval ports and the great commercial ports
rigidly apart. In this matter Australia has
an abundant choice of naval ports—Port
Stephens, Twofold Bay, Portland, Port Lin-
coln, A 1 bany, Gladstone, Bowen and a dozen
other unused harbors. In this matter some
northern port should have the preference. The
greatest risk of a sudden attack is there, and to
put the naval headquarters down in the
far south-east as if the enemy was expected
from Chili or the Chatham Islands is parochial-
ism gone mad. Of course, Sydney did well
enough as a naval centre in the old days of the
subsidised British squadron. There were no
questions then of building ships, casting cannon,
making steel plates, or erecting fortifications for
the protection of the docks and shipbuilding
works. There was no question of room for ex-
pansion, for the squadron was never expected to
grow any larger. There was no serious question
of repairs, for the squadron—being an inefficient
picnic affair of no fighting value—wasn’t expected
to remain in these waters and suffer damage when
war broke out; instead it was to leave with all
speed for a rendezvous at Singapore. All the
requirements of a little, transitory, ready-made
fleet like that—one that just dropped in—were
some moorings, a pub, girls to dance with, and a
screw-driverand gimletforsmallrepairs. And when
the naval jest at Garden Island was constructed
Sydney had not much more than half its present
population and less than one-fourth of its present
shipping, so in these days there was a fairamount of
room. No British Government would be in the
least degree likely to establish even a toy naval
base in Sydney Harbor as affairs are to-day. These
things are known, or should be known, to the
S. M. Herald; but whfen the most important
interests of Australia are in one scale, and the
diseased craving to bring everything to Sydney-
State capital, Federal capital, railway centre,
Treasury, Government offices, arsenal, naval head-
quarters, military headquarters and all the rest —
is in the other, the diseased craving seems to win
every time.
* * * *
New South Wales has already suffered heavy
loss through this maddened yearning to drag
everything to the S. M. Herald’s doorstep. In
younger days settlement rushed out west and
south and north—strong, vigorous settlement
which promised great things. But an infamous
railway system was devised to cut off commerce
from every port save Sydney, and to force the
outlying communities to trade oidy with that
port, no matter how much needless and costly
haulage it might.involve. That system, combined
with a disgraceful land monopoly, has killed a great
deal of remote settlement; and over a great part
of N.S.W. a backwash has set in towards Sydney.
As evidence on this point, the last Census was
taken in 1901, before the great drought year (1902),
and this was one of the results :
N.S.W. Counties which Lost Population Between 1891
and 1901.
Buller Murray Sturt
Gresham Jamison Waradgery
Hunter Kennedy Boorondara
Roxburgh Dowling Caira
Canbelego Cowper Franklin
Livingstone Mossgiel Mouramba
Narran Rankin Waljeers
Wentworth Weerunda Woore
Yanda Barrona Culgoa
Delalah Evelyn Farnell
Fitzgerald Gunderbooka Irrara
Landsborough Mootwingee Poole
Tandora Tara Tongowoko
Ularara Windeyer Yantara
Young Napier
In other words, out of 141 counties 44 were being
depopulated, largely through the Herald and
Telegraph and Evening News policy of
dragging everything to Sydney. Ten of these
decaying counties are located in the really well-
watered part of the State; and among those of
them which have railway communication may be
enumerated Buller, Gough, Roxburgh, Murray,
Jamison, Sturt, Waradgery, Canbelego, Napier
and Cowper. Some of these are even on great
main lines of railway, like that which connects
Sydney with Brisbane. And the record takes no
notice of many counties in which population,
though it didn’t decrease, was practically sta-
tionary. Camden, for instance, right alongside
Sydney, and with two great railways running
through it, gained 817 people in 10 years ; Vernon
(North Coast district) gained 68; Westmoreland
(the Katoomba country) gained 10 ; Stapylton,
135; Flinders, 15; Gregory, 37; Kilfera, 18;
Manara, 3; Taila, 26; and there were other
equally humorous cases.
* * * *
Counties, however, are, to most people in
N.S.W., little more than names. The list of the
decaying towns carries more real meaning. In the
report of the Census for 1901 there was published
a list of 306 of the more important country towns
and villages of the State. Of these 71 were fading
away—being killed off, partly by land monopoly
and partly by the policy of dragging everything
to the S. M. Herald’s office door in Sydney.
Here is the official list
Dying Towns of N.S.W.
Araluen Greta Murrurrundi
Bega Gulgong Nymagee
Beliingen Gundagai South Palmer’s Island
Berrima Hartley Vale Peak Hill
Blackheath Hill End Picton
Bodalla Hinton Plattsburg

Even the most hardened liar can’t set this lament-
able result down to Protection, for the Census was
taken before the first Federal Parliament met and
before the Kingston tariff was heard of. Nor can
the decay be set down to drought. Six of the
perishing towns are in the county of Cumberland,
in which Sydney stands ; 12 are in the adjacent
sea-coast county of Camden—a well-watered
region, from which Sydney derives most of its
water supply ; four are in the well-watered sea-
coast county of Northumberland, in which New-
castle stands, and which is pervaded by the great
Hunter .River. Most of the others are somewhere
in the well-watered east. Quite a number of them
are railway towns—-in fact, most of them are
either on a railway or close to one. It is the town
which has had an expensive railway built to it—
the place like Blackheath, Bourke, Bowral, Camp-
belltown, Dubbo, Goulburn, Kiama, Mittagong,
Picton, and many more on the list—on which
the Herald’s favorite policy falls most
heavily. The great idea is to use the railway, by
ft careful manipulation of rates and by other
devices, as a means whereby all the local raw
material must go to Sydney, and whereby the
manufactured goods made in Sydney or imported
at Sydney are enabled to pervade the country to
the destruction of country factories and work-
shops. Therefore many a country town has cause
to curse the day when railways, worked according
to the policy of dragging everything to Sydney,
were invented.
* * * *
Sometimes the slump of the N.S.W. country
town has been a great slump ; at other times it
has been a mere imperceptible decay. Comparing
the best days of the past with the figures of 1901,
Araluen dropped from a population of 2900 to one
of 593 ; Bowral from 2258 to 1752. Gerringong,
in the rich South Coast cow land, fell in ten years
from 1534 to 1051, and Greta, further north, from
1751 to 861. Jamberoo, also in the rich South
Coast cow region, decayed in 10 years from 2235
to 1291. Kangaloon and Major’s Creek have been
decaying for 30 years and Morpeth for 20.
Mulgoa, in a rich district within driving distance
of Sydney, fell in ten years from a population of
698 to one of 476. Richmond, only 38 miles from
Sydney and with good railway communication,
has been on the perisli since 1881; so have South
Shoalhaven and Stroud. Sutton Forrest has been
decaying since 1871. Temora fell in 20 years from
3254 to 1603, and Tingha from 2424 to 727. Urana
has been dying for 20 years. Wallerawang.
nominally a great railway junction, had 2307
people in 1881 and is now down to 538. But the
list threatens to grow both long and dreary.
* * * *
In the year 1871, out of every 10,000 people in
N.S.W. 2743 were located in Sydney. In 1901
Sydney represented 3578 inhabitants out of every
10,000. It is not through any real want of sea-
ports that this lamentable congestion goes on, for
the seaports are there. But it is carefully arranged
that there is no town on Port Stephens. It
is carefully arranged, by the refusal of railway
communication, that there is no town on Jervis
Bay. Also, through the‘refusal of railway com-
munication, the once-promising town of Eden, on
Twofold Bay, is dying out. The parochial papers
of Sydney are full of deep regret at the unhealthy
congestion of population into one absurdly bloated
city, at the fact that half the State is losing popu-
lation, at the painful circumstance that many
inland towns are dying and their ghosts are going
to the dogs, and at the regrettable spectacle of
every good harbor that the State possesses except
Sydney lying practically idle and deserted. These
papers even weep at times over the remote farmer
who has to give up the struggle because, even when
he has a good port within 50 miles of him and
Sydney is 300 miles away, still the State railway
department says he must send his produce to
Sydney or else let it rot on the ground. The
Sydney daily papers would do anything on earth
for these harassed people outback except the only
things which will do them any good. That is to
say, they will do all things save these four :
(1) Recommend a heavy progressive land-tax to auto-
matically break up the big estates which are strangling
such towns as Picton, Goulburn and the like.
(2) Advocate the making of railways along the shortest
possible routes tb such outlets as Port Stephens and
Twofold Bay, so that the farmers and pastoralists of the
country whereof these places are the natural outlets
may have the shortest and cheapest access to the sea-
board.
(3) Demand a readjustment of railway rates so that
Sydney shall have no preference over other ports.
(4) Stop clamoring for the bringing of everything, from
the Federal capital'to the stamp-printing job, to Sydney.
To put the matter shortly, the old stodgy parish-
minded daily papers of the old city want to do
the philanthropic with one hand and the im-
possible with the other. They believe in a general
way that the crowding of the bulk of the popula-
tion into one big metropolis is an evil; that the
country districts should be settled ; that the pas-
toralist and agriculturist, who are described as
the backbone of the land, should have the cheapest
and easiest possible outlet for their produce ; that
local government is a great thing, and that undue
concentration is an evil ; in fact, they areanchorM'
to all the regulation platitudes of that sort. Hut
these things are mere theories. In a much more
practical way the same papers believe that every-
thing should be hauled to Sydney, or as near it as
possible, where it will be close up to their offices,
and where the extra population it will create’
must help their circulation—the State capital and
the Federal capital ; the State and Fejgral
Government offices ; the termini of all the State
railways (with special rates to bring the trade to
Sydney); the terminus of the Federal transcon-
tinental line; the Federal naval depdt and
shipbuilding yards; the law courts; the mili-
tary headquarters ; and the whole show. And as
the selfish clamor to bring everything to Sydney
is clamored in dead earnest, while the demand
that the country generally, and Australia gener-
ally, should have a fair chance is a mere perfunc-
tory and theoretical business whereby the paro-
chial papers attempt to salve their consciences and
save their souls from perdition, the demand that
everything should be hustled to Sydney is on top
all the time. It is real; the demand for decen-
tralisation is a mere pretence.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Jew Who Found the Pole.
In the dispute between Dr. Cook (whose people
are really the Hebrew Kochs, of Frankfort) and
Commander Peaky as to the discovery of the
North Pole the stock of the Jew, so far as present
evidence goes, is distinctly looking up. The Jew
is calm and dignified, and freely admits that the
Gentile got to the Pole ; the Gentile is wild and
angry, and won’t admit that the Jew got there.
This wouldn’t matter much if Peaky stuck to
mere evidence, but the animus he displays casts a
lot of doubt on his case. For instance, he wrote
to this effect a year and four months ago —that is
to say in May, 1908 :
Dr. Cook has located himself at Etah, which has been
my depot for years. He has appropriated the Eskimos I
trained, and has taken the dogs collected ready for my
coming- The action of Dr. Cook in going north
sub rosa for the admitted purpose of forestalling me is
one of which no man possessing a sense of honor would be
guilty.
That kind of language, written long before any
news of Cook’s discovery came to hand, shows
in the first place, that Peary regarded the Pole as
his Pole—his private and personal prop or stump
—and though he was trying to get there first, he
regarded it as a shameful and dishonorable thing
for Cook to try to get there first. The fact that
the Pole was common property, and that Cook
couldn’t afford to wait till old age and senile
decay came on him before making his effort, and
that he (Peary) had been allowed a mighty long
innings without serious competition—he had been
about 17 years on the job—didn’t apparently*count
for anything with Peary. He complained, too,
that Cook had made his headquarters at the same
Eskimo village, in Danish or Canadian territory,
which he used; but if the Government which
owned the country didn’t object, it is hard to see
why this United States person should. Further,
he complained that Cook had hired certain
Eskimo and dogs; but an Eskimo is the cab of
these parts, and why Cook shouldn’t hire him if
he was on the stand waiting for a fare it is
hard to see—especially if Cook paid the fare
liberally. Cook seems to have left unlimited
Eskimo and dogs for Peary —in fact the hiring
of two men out of even a very small nation was
hardly an attempt to cripple his rival. Peary
talks of them as special Eskimo whom he had
“trained,” but the idea of the Eskimo, his brain
stored with all the knowledge of arctic living
and travelling that the world possesses, being
“trained” by a stranger from a temperate
climate seems rather absurd. In fact, Peary
seems to have started with a conviction that not
only the Pole but the Eskimo, the dogs and the
harbors thereabouts were his, and when the
flying Jew disappeared into the North ahead
of him he got into a frame of mind which
didn’t fit him to take an unbiassed view of the
Jew’s performances. He is reported as saying
that he found no traces of Cook’s visit to the
Pole; but seeing that the Pole is said to be
located on moving ice, the traces would natur-
ally have shifted a great many miles in the
period between the date of Cook’s alleged visit
and that of Peary’s alleged visit. Furthermore
it seems doubtful if so angry a man as Peary wpuld
have taken a wholly fair-minded view of Cook’s
tracks if he had met them. He was probably wild
enough to say they were bears’ footprints. It is
added that the Eskimo who accompanied Cook say
he never reached the Pole and never went out of
sight of land ; but it doesn’t seem to be exactly
and distinctly a case of the Eskimo saying this to
the press, b it rather of Peary saying they said it.
And even it they did say it they seem to be the
Eskimo whom Peary says he “trained,” and how
far they might be inclined, after they had
finished their temporary engagement with Cook,
to give their old employer a leg up is an open
question. Peary’s letter, dated 16 months ago,
showed, or distinctly suggested, that at that'date
the Hebrew explorer had fled past in a northerly
direction. If, as apparently alleged by Peary, he
only went a little way north and then sat on a
snowbank to fill in time, he would probably have re-
turned in eight months instead of 16, for with good
fortune and good travelling that period would have
sufficed for the dash to the Pole and back. If
Cook sat down needlessly for an extra eight
months merely to lend a little extra frill to
his story, the impression of the place he sat upon
should be clearly visible, and the bones of fully a
year’s food should be scattered around. Yet
Peary says there were no signs of Cook. The
signs of Cook loafing for a year about the coast
upon a fixed surface should be at least as clear as
the signs of Cook paying a hurried visit to the
Pole on a moving surface. In this matter it is
worth while to remember that Peary comes of
people who, with all their good qualities, are very
bad sports and very bad losers—also very
bumptious winners. The Jew, in a sporting
sense, plays the game better than the man
of long U.S. descent. Peary, in his capacity
as a bad sport, made a grievance of Cook’s expe-
dition 16 months ago, as his own letter shows.
He had 16 months after that in -which to grit his
teeth and accumulate bitterness and bias against
the Hebrew who was supposed to be ahead. Of
course, there may be evidence yet to come which
will utterly blow out Cook ; but on the present
evidence his case looks far better than that of his
noisy antagonist. Also it looks a lot better than
it did a week ago, before Peary began to “shoot
off his mouth.”
The Letting In Of Many Waters.
A feeling is abroad these times among thinking
people and pessimists and similar cattle that
almost anything is liable to happen. There are
generally a number of events which man looks for
in a vague sort of way, and believes in after a
perfunctory sort of fashion, but which he never
really expects to see. The fall of Constantinople
was one of these; for 800 years it was obvious
that the decayed Greek empire hung by a hair,
yet it weathered the storm so long that when at
last it was extinguished through the hair break-
ing, and when the familiar and tottering and in-
credibly venerable cripple no longerdoddered hi the
highest place at the banquet of the kings, Europe
turned pale and said that the end of the world
was at hand. Nothing is more shocking than ‘the
sudden arrival of the thing which so many gepera-
tions have looked for that looking for itf has
become a tradition ; then the fact that they' can
no longer look for it because it has come makes
them feel that somebody is dead. A month or
so back there were three events which loomed
prominently in the stereotyped expectation'of the
future —three events that everybody expected in
a formal way, 3 - et didn’t expect, because the habit
of expecting them had become so fixed that it
seemed impossible to expect a time when they
wouldn’t be expected. They were :
(1) The Finding of the North Pole.
(2) The Successful Invasion of Britain.
(3) The General Resurrection of the Dead.
All these things had been hanging fire for
centuries. Waiting for them had become a solid


custom, and the idea of a day arriving when men
wouldn’t be waiting for them was almost beyond
human comprehension. A month ago it seemed
that any one of them would have created as
great a shock as any of the other two if
any of the three had appeared in huge
letters on the daily paper placards. Then
the Pole, which had defied centuries of effort, was
suddenly found twice—in fact the habit of
finding the Pole became so confirmed all in an
instant that there is an inclination to station a
constable there to regulate sledge traffic, and
make the walking explorer keep to the right, and
run in the sledge explorer for furious dog-driving.
So one great barrier is broken down, and there is
a hidden conviction that, the movement having
Begun, anything is liable to turn up, in a manner
of speaking. If the next upheaval is the General
Resurrection of the Dead, the community realises
that after a week it might get so accustomed to
meeting Henry Parkes arid PoNTfus Pilate in
the streets that it would hardly even stop to ask
if either of them had a month on hi in. And if the
next surprise was the conquest of jlfitaih—well, a
month after the first news came to hand the in-
formation that Kaiser WiLIiELM wore Brussels
lace on his coronation robe inAVestminstor Abbey
might seem hardly worth mehtionitlg. When
staggering things commence to transpire they are
liable to keepon transpiringtill futther notice. The
finding of the Pole is a breach in the embankment
of old habit, and the great waters niay come
through any minute. When the Pole, which has
been an impossible and far-ahead dream for so
many centuries, has rushed past us without the
slightest notice and become a back nhmber, the
thought arises that the German dhnbxation of
London or the Japanese invasion Of Australia may
also, any day, become back numbers and there
commonplaces of history.

“S. M. Herald ” Makes a Deplorable
Suggestion.
For audacity, the S. M. Herald’S suggestion
(8/9/’O9) that the position of Australian High
Commissioner should carry a salary of £lO,OOO per
annum, in order, forsooth, to tempt G. Reid to
accept it, takes some beating. Since when has
Reid become a wage-earner of anything like that
value ? He is a barrister in a State where, at thb
present time, no one practising before the courts is
amassing half of £lO,OOO a year. And he is hot
reckoned, in the profession or out of it, to be in
the first flight even of local advocates. Says the
Hbßald blandly
The appointment of someone like Mr. G. H. Reid would
be justified over and over again.
No reasons are supplied in favor of that amazing
statement. The Herald doesn’t attempt to ex-
plain why the man who wasn’t considered a fit
and proper person to represent the Anti-Sosh
party in Parliament at £1650 per annum is the
ideal character to represent all Australia in Lon-
don at £lO,OOO a year. It just pushes forward its
wild assertion and leaves it there. The Bulletin
doesn’t consider that the appointment of G. Reid
would be justified, and it submits herewith a few
good reasons why
(1) It should need no arguing that the High Commissioner
must be what this country knows as a “good Australian.”
Than Reid, there is no man in Federal politics
who has opposed more virulently every plank of
the Australian platform. He was against a White
Australia, and when he found that cause hope-
less he barracked frenziedly for a piebald ocean.
He was, and still is, hostile to the tariff. Till a few
weeks ago he was a bitter assailant of compulsory military
training and of an Australian navy. Latterly he has
become an unwilling convert to those policies—the sort
of convert who is least to be trusted. Now it is of
prime importance that the aims and methods of the
national policy should be fairly and adequately presented
abroad. The Six Hatters and Petriana lies, and other
fabrications of the sort, which Reid exploited for all they
were politically worth during the general Federal election
before last, have gained Australia a reputation which it
will take years to live down. Further untruths along
similar lines are a certainty in the future. Thus, as
recently as the just-concluded Press Conference, editors
Ward (Sydney Telegraph), Cunningham (Melbourne
Argus), and Davies (Hohart Mercury) lost no
chance of declaring that the Commonwealth was
against a local navy and in favor of cadging all of its sea-
defence from Britain. Is Reid the man to correct mis-
representations of that sort ? And would his corrections
be accepted if he so fought down his ingrained pre-
judices as to make them? It ; must be remembered
that the Times, the Morning Post, the Daily Mail,
and the rest of the big British newspapers keep records
of Australian speeches and doings in their pigeon-holes.
Nothing is surer than that whenever G. Reid said “ Yes ”
in London as High Commissioner, he would be confronted
broadcast with occasions on which he said “No” in Aus-
tralia as Opposition Leader. The Canadian Immigration
Agents, whoarepaidafat commission for every able-bodied
citizen they divert from another country to Canada, have
also to be reckoned with. It is certain that each time
Reid essayed to sing the praises of Australia before the
British public, extracts from his slanderous Anti-Sosh
campaign speeches of three years back would be raked
up to his confusion and the detriment of this country.
(2) Australia requires in London a representative who is
mentally and physically active—a man of energy capable
of tackling the many different problems which will
confront a High Commissioner willing to live up to his
great office. Reid is obese, indolent and nearly 65. An
infantile passion for sleep afflicts him—sleep and boiled
sweets. He was never an organiser, and he has not had
the intellectual training which fits a man of his age to
master new and complicated subjects. His cheap philoso-
phising and his pawky jests are well enough suited to the
old ladies who comprise Empire League audiences, but
they will fall grievously fiat before educated and critical
folk. His lack of exact knowledge and his notorious
hopelessness as a business man inspire commercial people
with a lively distrust of him, even as his constant buffoon-
eries alienate the man in the street.
(3) It would be absurd were Australia to be represented
;in London by a Foreign-trader. Avery few years must
see the arrival of Tariff Reform in the United Kingdom.
The anomaly of a CoBDEN-ite as, amongst other things,
trade representative of one Protectionist country in the
capital of another is too plain to need demonstration.
(4) There is the consideration that the appointment of
Reid to this billet can only be made by the utter humilia-
tion and stultification of Alfred Deakin. Deakin
has made a lot of sacrifices of late to hold the
favor of Cook and his followers. To yield to
them on the Reid question would be the limit, and the
absolute dead finish. Not once, but a score of times, has
Deakin expressed his conviction of Reid’s utter Unfitness
for the office of High Commissioner. Not one Minister
dare leave the Cabinet if Deakin insists on his
Constitutional right as Prime Minister to veto
what he considers a bad appointment. On the
other hand, the last remaining vestige of respect
which Australia retains for Deakin’s consistency and
honesty will vanish if he yields on this point, and by so
doing becomes privy to an appointment which he has
for years denounced aq the worst conceivable ; and Aus-
tralia doesn’t want to lose the last very small remainder
of its respect for Deakin, if it can help it.
Those 'are some of the plain reasons why Aus-
tralian nationalists hold that the appointment of
Reid to, . the High Commissionership, whether
at £lO,OOO or tenpence per annum, would be an
outrage. If there are contentions of equal weight
on the other side of the case, this paper would
admire vastly to hear them.

“They Might Never Occur Again.”
Dear Bulletin,— So I read that Mr. Hughes, a
prominent Federal Laborist, an ardent advocate
of the rights of the people and a strong supporter
of the Referendum, desires the settlement of the
Australian capital to be hastened because, in his
own words, if the daily paper report is correct: —
The circumstances that made for the selection of Yass-
Oanberra might never occur again. The new Parliament
would enter on its duties absolutely untrammelled.
It is most interesting to notice Mr. Hughes’
anxiety to get this affair fixed up before the people
can get a chance to declare their opinions on the
matter, either directly by referendum or even in-
directly at a general election. Mr. Hughes is a
powerful believer, after a theoretical fashion, in
the self-governing rights of the people ; but when
he has his own little idea to push through, no
one—not even Bruce Smith, or the Victorian
House of Rich Landlords—seems to hold these
rights in more utter contempt. Nothing more
brazen than his appeal that the Yassberra
business should be snoved through without the
people having a chance to speak has been heard
of, to my knowledge, in recent Australian politics.
Consider and size up the history of this business.
Some four or five years ago the site on the Snowy
Biver was selected as the capital of Australia,
Watson's Labor Government, of which Hughes
was a member, being then in power. The matter
was not referred directly to the people, as it might
well have been ; but there was a general election in
1906, and the Labor party—which was supposed to
be partly responsible for the selection, seeing that it
was in ofiice at the time—received so much popular
approval that it came back a good deal stronger
than before. Neither Watson nor Hughes men-
tioned Yassberra to the people ht that elec-
tion, or explained that the capital question was
other than the settled thing it appeared.
Then in the new Parliament a site (Yass-
Canberra) which hadn’t been even mentioned
before, was suddenly brought forward—Wat-
son and Hughes assisting—and carried with
a rush. It had been freely reported that
if any attempt was made to upset the
decision which had been endorsed (so far as
a general election can endorse anything) by the
people in 1906, the new Labor Government would
lbt the people settle the matter by referendum ;
but for some reason or other—perhaps \V. M.
Hughes knows the reason as well as anybody
else—this idea wasn’t even mentioned in
Parliament. It appeared to be regarded as
Unsafe to give the people a say. Since
theti, it seems to be the passionate desire of
Wi M. Hughes to get the matter settled before
the people can have any say at all. The reason
'fab'assigns is that “the new Parliament
Will enter on its duties absolutely un-
trammelled ” —in other words, the new Parlia-
ment Will represent the first chance the people
can have to express their utter disgust (if
they happen to have any utter disgust about
theih) at the Yassberra trick and Mr.
Hughes’ share in it, and it is advis-
able to have the matter securely nailed
down before the people can get at it. Possibly
his plea will be that it has become a weary old
business and should be settled somehow ; but the
reply is that it is mostly the fault of Hughes and
one or two of bis friends that it is a weary,
unsettled old busitiess—the affair was settled five
years ago, but they toiled in the Congested Popu-
lation interest till they unsettled it. Probably it
will also be said that the capital site doesn’t really
matter so very much, and it isn’t worth while
keeping politics in a ferment about it ; yet it
mattered so much that Hughes and Watson
couldn’t rest till they got it placed close up to
Sydney, which is their own headquarters, and it
still matters so much that Hughes can’t trust the
people to have a voice in it. It seems to me that
for a brazen Tory (when it suits him), a high-
handed repudiator of the self-governing rights of
the Australian people (when they are liable to get
in the way of his own local prejudices), and a
violent and unabashed autocrat (when he wants
to carry his own point), W. M. Hughes takes some
beating.—Yours, etc., Henry Hoßsecollar.
“Political Unrest.”
Since the Murray Ministry introduced its new
land-tax measure, there has been much commotion
amongst the old Tory brigade which has practi-
cally ruled Victoria for so long. The Argus,
which has been scared into supporting this party,
refers to the movement as “political unrest”;
and everything points to a stormy time for the
new tax. There has already been a meeting of
the Country Party—which is another name for the
party of stagnation and drift—and as a result of
this meeting the Argus made this remarkable
statement: —
One thing that has been made abundantly clear, not only
by country members, but by others on the Ministerial side,
is that they are not, to be swayed in their consideration
of the land-tax proposals bv the effect it will have upon
the subdivision of large estatks. ... It will be necessary
for the Treasurer to show that the land-tax will be
required next year in order to provide the State with the
revenue needed to carry on its services.
That is a plain intimation from the utterly
unpatriotic Tory party that it doesn’t care a straw
for the fact that Victoria has been exporting its
agricultural population steadily for the last 18
years. It isn’t in the least concerned because
last Census showed 13 out of the State’s 37
counties to be on the down grade as regards
population. It doesn’t propose to take the
slightest notice of Alfred Deakin’s famous
“call” to the States to unlock their lands—not
that Deakin has been calling very audibly of late.
When this is the position in the allegedly demo-
cratic Assembly, what sort of chance is
Murray’s Progressive Land-tax Bill likely
to have in the House of Rich Landlords, and
how much attention is that institution likely to
pay to Deakin’s call—if Alfred the Affable
really is calling '! The evidence keeps accumulat-
ing that a Federal tax is the only thing that will
meet the case. It is accumulating at Alfred’s
very door. The county of Grenville, in which his
constituency of Ballarat is located, has 12,000
fewer people than it had 30 years ago.
The Serf in Broken Boots.
The Clerk is a little Sydney paper published in
the interests of the movement to secure a Wages
Board and a minimum salary for the ill-paid
slaves of the pen and the ledger. It is published
at the Worker Office, and is shoved along by the
capable Harold Mercer, secretary of the Clerks’
Union. Some of its items are worth reading.
Here is one
A clerk came into the office of the Union last week and
told the narrative of his experiences. Six months ago,
when he had had the good fortune to be possessed of an
entirely new outfit, and consequently a dressy appear-
ance, he entered the service of a wealthy firm of brokers.
The salary was only 355. per week, and it was one of the
highest salaries paid in that office ; but he had been
unable to obtain anything better. However, he was a
married man with a small family, and he was unable to
replenish his newness at the price. His boots went first,
and he appeared in the office one morning with a patch
on one of them. In another place that little defect might
not have been observed, but in this particular firm there
was a great desire to maintain a splendid appearance
without paying for it. The unfortunate clerk was in-
formed, before two hours had passed, that one of the
partners wished to speak to him ; and he did speak to
him, kindly but seriously, about the enormity of
. coming into the office in old boots. He explained
that the old boots were the newest he had. The shocked
partner asked him if 355. a week was not sufficient for him
to clothe himself upon, and hinted a suspicion that drink
must run away with his weekly wealth ; and when he
was informed that whilst the clerk could clothe himself
well on 355. a week, he had other thing's to do with the
money, and he found that the upkeep of a family with-
out any drinking took his whole fortune, he stated, in a
grieved manner, that the clerk’s original well-dressed
appearance had given him the impression that he had
other resources, and that otherwise he would not have
engaged him, and that he would consider what could be
done. At the end of the week the clerk found thefresult
of his consideration of the matter in a sack; and a dis-
possessed clerk is wondering whether a prevalent idea
that a man has no right to be a clerk unless he possesses
an independent income is the cause of the low salaries
that a number of employers offer.
In this connection it may he mentioned that an
official of the Colonial Bank (Melbourne) has lately
been sent to gaol for three years. In the course
of 24 years’ service he had acquired a wife and
four children, and had climbed to a position of
great trust and responsibility and to a salary of
rather over £4 a week. Then, looking at the
hopeless years ahead of him and the steady
approach of old age r he acquired an unfortunate
brevity in his cash. Of course, any one who looks
at the accounts of any of the smaller bahks
can see that under the present system any
large all-round increase of salaries is impos-
sible ; but that merely proves that the system is
an utterly loony affair. There is a superfluity of
banks, and especially a superfluity of branch
offices. When a quiet little Victorian town like
Bairnsdale has six banks and six managers and
six sets of premises where two would be abundant,
nothing but hard sweating can make the business
pay a respectable dividend. But the harmless,
necessary clerk isn’t responsible for the madness
of his superiors, and it is the duty of Parliament
to secure the clerk a fair wage, and let his frantic
employers readjust things to suit the new
conditions.
* _ A System Which. Has Outlived Its
Usefulness.
The oft-recurring jury disagreement evil has
burst on Melbourne in so marked a form of late
that the very Judges—usually so placidly self-
satisfied where the system they administer is con-
cerned—are sitting up and taking disgusted notice
of it. A little while ago an early Victorian was
charged with assaulting an eight-year-old infant.
The jurymen debated the ease privily for hours,
and then emerged and told C.-J. Madden that
they couldn't agree. The Judge sent them back
with this injunction :
Those in a minority should try to come to an agree-
ment with the others. If one man is standing out he
should try to let himself be convinced by the others.
In ten minutes the jury filed into court with a
verdict of "Not Guilty.” Without casting re-
flection either on the jury or on the oldster whom
it exonerated, it is a fair thing to say that this
sort of happening (which is painfully frequent) is
unsatisfactory and calculated to make a mock of
Justice. As things are, juries have to be unani-
mous in their findings in criminal cases, or the-
same end in smoke, and all the time, talk, hard
swearing and cash expended thereon are wasted.
There is no valid reason why twelve burgesses,
picked at random, should be any more unanimous,
on the subject of an accused person’s wrong-doing
than on the question of the tariff, or the Fused
Government, or any other suspected circum-
stance. The Law lays it down that each juryman
shall swear that he will return an absolutely just
verdict according to his lights. As a result in any
given case one of the following undesirable
things is liable—in fact, likely—to occur :
(1) A juryman may find himself in honest dis-
agreement with his fellows. Being disinclined
to perjure himself he stands out, endures and
causes the others to endure the discomfort of
being locked up for many weary profitless hours,
and, in the end, brings the trial to naught. Or
(2) he may be won over at the prospect of a night
in durance, and go the way of the majority,
despite the fact that he considers it the wrong
way. Or (3) he may be a personal friend or bitter
enemy of accused and resolved beforehand, in
consequence, as to his verdict. Or (4) he may be
"squared.” The squared juror is one of the
commonest features of modern injustice.
In all our big cities there exist folks
who specialise in going through jury-panels,
ear-marking “ bad blokes” (i.e., ultra-pietists and
the like) and subsequently approaching the un-
challenged when the trial has begun. Often the
juryman doesn’t wait to be approached. Scorning
the offices of any officious middleman, he goes
straight to headquarters, names his price, and, if
the case is urgent and the person in trouble is
possessed of ready cash and horse-sense, gets it.
The purchase of one man is sufficient, and a dis-
agreement follows. Other disagreements are pro-
curable on the same terms, and after a while the
Crown drops its efforts to get a conviction. The
introduction of the Scotch majority verdict system
would obviate this absurd state of affairs. In the
Land of Haggis 15 jurymen are empanelled. The’
decision of the majority of them' goes. It is-
not hard to corrupt one juror ; but, demonstrably,,
it is so hard as to be well nigh impossible to cor-
rupt eight—which makes for prompt and un-
biassed verdicts, and a purification of the springs
of Justice generally. With the introduction of
such a reform as the above ought to go the insti-
tution of Crown Defenders for all classes of
criminal cases. The rich alleged embezzler can
afford to brief experienced counsel to put his case
for him; the indigent alleged sneak-thief can’t.
That needs to be rectified. The Crown Defender
should be a lawyer of about the same mental
calibre as the Crown Prosecutor; he should
approach his duties in the same spirit; and should
always be ready to take up and prepare a case
in the same painstaking fashion as the
other fellow. And, finally, the whole of
each criminal case needs to be liable to
review by an Appeal Court, consisting of
a Bench of judges sitting without a jury, and
possessing the power to reverse the verdict and
vary (either way) the sentence of the lower court.
The possibility that a convicted person, on sub-
mitting his case to the last jurisdiction, might
have his term increased would militate powerfully
against frivolous appeals. All this would cost,
money, and call for the institution of a lot of new
legalmachinery, officials and so forth. But it wouldi
be worth while. As a fact, there is hardly anything
that would not be worth while to rescue this*
country from the slough of legal despond in which
its played-out judicial system and its jury-squarers
have landed it of late years.

Too Much. Freetrade in the Sugar Industry.
The Queensland sugar people have been feeling a-
little less comfortable during the past few weeks.-
Under present arrangements the so-called bonus
on white-grown sugar is to gradually disappear ;
and they have been relying partly on economies,
including the development of a trade in by-
products, to make good die heavy loss. One of the
chief of these by-products is molasses—a valuable
food which has been going to waste to the extent
of hundreds of tons a year simply because the
market for it wasn’t good enough to stand the
crushing freights from Queensland ports. Apart
from the vast quantity that was used locally
as manure, and the vaster quantity of which no
record was kept at all, 1,587,000 gallons of this
excellent food were deliberately run to waste at
Queensland sugar mills last season. A few years
ago the position was worse still; but little by
little a trade has been created, and besides quanti-
ties distilled and prepared for human food, a tidy
industry has been built up in the manufacture of
molasses fodder for cattle and sheep. The white
sugar growers of the North have got very little
out of these'industries so far; but they had large
hopes for the future. Now, however, it appears
that that bloated monopoly, the Colonial Hu gar
Refining Co., has begun to ship quantities
of molasses from Fiji, where the cane is
grown entirely by colored labor—mostly the
cheapest Indian coolie labor—and as the mono-
poly has just put its own specially-built tank-
steamer on to the Fiji trade, the Northern white
growers find one of their props slipping from under
them. For the coolie-grown molasses come into.
Australia duty-free, and that and the co.’s speciali
shipping facilities give the monopoly complete-
iontrol of the situation. The natural complement;
;o a bonus on white-grown Australian sugar is, of;
sourse, a stiff duty on all foreign-grown black
sugar and sugar-cane products; and the sooner-
;his is put on the less damage will be done to as
still-unsettled Australian industry.
There occurred last week one of the most
flagrantly unjustifiable interferences with the
course of justice that N.IS.W. has known ; and
because, presumably, C. G. Wade was responsible
for the same, the morning papers have joined in a
conspiracy of silence comparable for utter dead-
ness to nothing outside a mausoleum. The facts
are briefly these: One McKyk, a big North
Sydney baker, was some time ago haled before
the Industrial Court for systematically breaking
the bakers’ award by paying his hands less
than the minimum wage fixed in that in-
dustry. No defence was offered, and Judge
Heydon fined respondent £5O. The money
was paid. Three months later McKye was
brought to the Court again. It then trans-
pired that during most of the foregoing 12 weeks
he had been flouting the Court in the calmest
fashion by paying his men on the old and inade-
quate scale. Judge Heydon— who is by no means
an employees’ man—expressed himself amazed at
the cynical illegality of McKyk, and mulcted him
Cheek.

sum of £l5 in each of 10 separate charges.
Whereupon Premier Wade stepped in and, with-
out any reference to Heydon and without, further-
more, having heard a word of evidence in any
of the cases, knocked off £75 from the sum-
total of the fine. It suggests some pregnant
queries. If the penalties of the Industrial
Court Judge are to be overruled in this
lightsome fashion, and without a pretence
of serious investigation, it seems a needless
waste of time and money for the State to
employ suah an official at all. Why not leave the
whole business to Wade, and permit him to come
to a decision in any given matter as a result of a
private chat on his homing ferry or train with the
employer? Here is an affluent and educated busi-
,ness man who has twice pleaded guilty to breaking
a law whose purport he thoroughly grasped. If
there is any excuse for him it isn’t apparent
to the general eye. Yet the State’s highest
political officer steps in and has half his
penalty remitted. In what is knowrr as
the “Friedman Case,’’ the Sydney morning
papers went beside themselves with shocked
grief over an alleged “tampering with Justice,”
which consisted in an Attorney-General releasing
a prisoner on the recommendation of the Judge who
said he had been wrongly convicted. No Judge
or jury or other sane human had any doubt as to
the guilt of McKye. He had none himself. And
the Judge who fined him went out of his wav to
mention that the sentence was “a lenient one ”in
the circumstances. Why was there any discrimi-
nation in his favor?
♦
Mayor Allen Taylor, of Sydney, has formally
issued the death-certificate of the “ Dreadnought
Movement” in the form of a brace of suggestions
to subscribers anent the application of the Dread-
nought money, failing the acceptance of which
they may get their coin back after the fashion of
the dissatisfied auditor at a penny gaff. Accord-
ing to Allen Taylor’s scheme, £50.000 of the
boodle which was to be used to save Britain in the
North Sea is to be allocated to build a Naval
Training College for Australia, and the other
£50,000 is to be spent on local Training
Farms. This is assuming that the £lOO,OOO
about which there has been so much talk
and blither and emotional uprnir in the last six
months eventuates—a contingency which at
present looks, to put it mildly, dashed unlikely.
The Bulletin has thought of several ways in
which the the insane old fund may so be spent as
to make N.S.W. appear as little of an idiot as
possible. One was that it should be employed
towards off some of the State’s hideous
and awful debt. A little figuring revealed the
fact that at compound interest the sum which local
loyalists whole-heartedly produced to save the Era-
pirefrotn annihilation would yield but half a million
sterling in 50 years. Further figuring revealed
that the fund would take about 100 years to swell to
two and three-quarter million pounds. So the
loan-discharging scheme was regretfully turned
down. Perhaps as good an object as any to which
the cash might be applied is the equipping of an
expedition to search for the South Pole. Polar
exploration is attracting a lot of attention just
now. The country which finds the South Pole
will get the advertisement of its life. It is geo-
graphically up to Australia to achieve the feat.
It would be a shamefid thing, for example, if a
Chow or a Dago or Jack Johnson suddenly
rushed forward and did it. All things considered,
there are a lot of arguments in favor of expending,
in this direction, such of the money as is forth-
coming and isn’t demanded back by enraged
patriots.
J. C. Watson’s gold-dredging mate, J. W.
Tewksbury, puts up a good fight for Australian
industries. A mostly Melbourne co. owns the
concession which J. C. Watson has been testing
in S’Africa, and the question came up at a meet-
ing in Melbourne, the other day, whether they
should get the dredges built in Australia or some-
where else. At once a row started between the
wretched and bigoted Hedges, the anti-Australian
misrepresentative of Fremantle (W.A.), and
Tewksbury. Hedges, who probably never worked
on a dredge in his life, said it was throwing money
away to get the plants built in Australia ; Tewks-
bury, the most successful dredge engineer in
the Commonwealth if not in the world, said that
if the dredges were to be built in England, he
wouldn’t put £1 into the concern
I have had a dredge built in Glasgow which was not
worth halt what it cost. The bearings.at the end of the
bottom tumbler, which had to run under water, were
watch-polished. Five minutes after starting work those
parts had lost this expensive polish. This was a piece of
stupidity of which no firm used to dredging would be
guilty.
Fremantle ought to be humming with industries ;
but as long as it is represented by a man who
reckons that it is sheer waste to spend Australian
money in Australia, Fremantle doesn’t deserve to
hum louder than a mosquito. Probably, however,
it doesn’t want to hum. Anyway, it knew all
along that Hedges, M.H.R., was connected with
a concern which supplies firewood to the Wes-
tralian mines, and which, if it doesn’t actually
import Austrians and Italians by the boatload,
snaps them up by dozens as soon as they land, so
that in many of the camps English is a dead lan-
guage.
.
The newly-arrived Salv’army “Commissioner”
proceeded at once to prick the bubble of erroneous
supposition re “juvenile immorality” in Aus-
tralia. John Madden’s “terrible” Melbourne
statistics didn’t stagger the expert from that cold
chaste country where, as we are told, the vir-
tuous influence of a beautiful home life restrains
young girls from gadding around in the dark.
Commissioner Hay, on being desired to shudder
at Australia’s youthful giddiness, said : “Theevil
has gained such a hold on Great Britain that
the Salvation Army authorities view it as a
moral scourge. Their maternity homes are
crowded with girl mothers.” And whilst the
purists hereabouts are wrangling over the ques-
tion of how to administer practical; lessons of
morality to the young, without verging on “in-
delicacy,” the Salv’army in Britain, it seems, has
“ appointed qualified teachers to instruct young
people in the essentials of sex physiology.”
A few plain remarks from a man who has been
there :
1 spent four years on the Overland Telegraph Line, and
travelled its entire length from Port Darwin to Port
Augusta. I can say that in the Territory proper there is
very little country that can be termed desert. South of
the McDonnell Ranges there are some very poor sandy
regions; but north of them, with the exception of
patches of scrub here and there, the land can all be
utilised. In amongst the ranges some splendid pastoral
country is to be had, and the facilities offered by the deep
and narrow gorges, through which the rivers run, for the
conservation of water are apparent to anyone. Maize and
other sub-tropical crops could be grown to perfection.
About Barrow and Tennant’s Creeks more good pastoral
country is to be had, while between there and Powell’s
Creek there is excellent cattle land. The same descrip-
tion also applies to Attack and Tomkinson Creeks,
Renner’s Springs, and other localities. At Powell’s Creek,
where I was for nearly two years, vegetables grow as well
as anywhere in the South, and I never saw horses fatten
more quickly than they did there. Going north is the
fine country on Newcastle Waters, the Strangways,
Roper and other rivers. Mr. Allan A. Davidson, the
discoverer of the Tanami goldfield, says in his journal:
“ Throughout the lower Northern Territory there is an
enormous area of metalliferous rocks extending through-
out the McDonnell, Burt, Trener and the ranges south of
the western end of the McDonnell. In addition to the
known gold-bearing areas, much of the country included
in these ranges will, no doubt, be proved to carry
gold ; but nothing but a series of rich discoveries would
advance the country under present conditions. The one
essential feature necessary for the development of
the interior and the opening of payable goldfields is
cheaper communication. This can only be accomplished
by continuing the transcontinental railway across the
continent. ... The possibilities this country contains
certainly warrant a great endeavor (even at a sacrifice for
a time) being made to create a central mining popula-
tion.” Mr. Davidson also speaks well of the stock capa-
bilities of the Musgrave Ranges and other localities
travelled by him between the telegraph line and Tanami.
While the construction of the telegraph line was going
on in ’7l or ’72 the natives brought in good quartz speci-
mens, and pointed west to indicate the locality they came
from. These would hardly be brought from Tanami, so
there may be another great goldfield hidden away in
that portion of the Territory. Another settlement like
Kalgoorlie would do a lot towards peopling the empty
North and promoting permanent settlement, besides
paying the interest on the railway. There seems every
prospect, therefore, of opening up big mineral fields by
means of this route. The line between Bourke and Clon-
curry would stand very little chance of doing so, as the
country has been too long and thoroughly traversed.
Another thing not to be lost sight of in favor of the
direct line is that there is no flooded country to get over.
And that is of more importance than some people think—
particularly those people who have never seen the in-
terior, yet talk and write about it at great length.
♦
A shocking instance of State interference with
Private Enterprise is reported from Melbourne,
where the Secretary for Mines has drawn the
attention of a firm of land agents to the fact that
the plans of a certain subdivision at the new Pow-
lett River township are incorrect, and that its
statements are calculated to mislead probable
purchasers. If “ reputable business men ” are to
be harassed in this fashion there is no knowing
where the thing will stop. The State may pre-
sently be compelling drapers who advertise goods
for sale at “less than cost price ” to actually sell
them at that. True, the State does so in Ger-
many already ; but then Germany is a benighted
country where they eat cabbages soaked in vine-
gar, and do other unaccountable things.
♦
If the people accept the new agreement whereby
the Commonwealth is to pay the States 255. per
inhabitant per annum, a fresh grief will be added
to the burdens of Premiers like Elliott Lewis
and John Weary, who rule over States where
land monopoly is constantly driving the young
men away. Between 1901 and 1905 Victoria
exported 51.803 more people than it imported.
Under the Deakin agreement John Weary will
stand at the border and count that exodus, and
say sadly : “ There goes £64,753 15s. per annum
of my revenue. If these people only marry
sufficiently to keep their numbers from diminish-
ing, there goes, on a 3J percent, basis, a capital of
nearly £2,000,000.” And the added misery will be
that the annual Federal subsidy of £64,753 15s.
which these people represent will be paid to some
other State, and John Weary’s State will be
taxed to help pay it. When census day is about
due there will be serious temptation to counteract
this land monopoly evil by holding a. great Exhi-
bition at Melbourne, and attracting 50,000 visi-
tors, who will be counted in the census and bring
in £62,500 a year of Federal subsidy from that
time to next census day. Likewise there will
be points about holding shows in border towns on
census day to attract visitors, who will natu-
rally represent subsidy, from the next State. A
carefully-arranged detention of the Sydney ex-
press on census night will be worth a few
thousands, and even the detention for one night
on a charge of “no visible” of three swagmen
who were just swagging out of the State will be
worth £37 10s. before the next enumeration. But
probably the best thing John Weary can do to
counterbalance the departing population trouble
is to alter the date of the Melbourne Cup
to March 31. On the other hand, Queensland
may reply with a bogus gold rush ; £2OOO of
Philp’s deficit spent in salting operations at the
right moment might attract 4000 men represent-
ing a claim of £5OOO a year on the Federal
treasury.
The mana of llua is on the wane. A year
ago the things this brown jest did, and the things
he said, caused much attention in Maoriland.
His Mdrmon tendencies gained him no little pro-
minence, and recruits came to him like bees
following their queen. Plump Maori maidens
joined his brigade, also tattooed old warriors and
their families. He formed a “ Parliament,” then
cultivated poetical locks, and allotted himself
seven permanent wives—mostly young and good-
looking^—in accordance, he said, with the Scrip-
ture. But converts come no longer, and the cash
is running out. Awhile ago Rua boasted that
God sent him five-pound notes at a snap of the
fingers. But he seems to have run out of snaps,
for the wolf is now at the door. The seven buxom
maidens are still with him, but the children are
being withdrawn and returned to the Government
schools ; and in the light of recent happenings
Rua’s day is just about done.

Foster Fraser, the traveller-journalist who
knows the civilised world as Peary sat’s he
does the Pole, delivered himself of a few
remarks about America at Sydney Y.M.C.A.
Hall on Monday night. George Reid intro-
duced him, and the resting politician’s wag-
gish ways seemed to infect the lecturer. During
the evening he exploited almost every jest
that has been coined hitherto in regard to the
U.S., its manners and customs ; also he produced
a few of his own minting. His style is whimsi-
cal, dry and restrained. One would suspect him
of Caledonian ancestry, even if he were called
O’Mulligan, and if G. Reid had not, claimed him
as a brother Scot. He was at his most interest-
ing while dealing with the mighty work-
shops of Pittsburg, Chicago, etc. He, didn’t
touch on the fiscal policy which had put them
there. Possibly consideration for his chairman
restrained him ; and, anyhow, he is a tariff reform
candidate at next general elections in the
Cold Land, and so presumably takes Protec-
tion pretty much for granted. The cus-
tomary amazing stories about the slickness,
rush and rapidity of Sam in his business
capacity were related and duly gasped at, and the
whole was brightened with lantern pictures. Any-
one who yearns for a swift sortof hurried, aeroplane
view of a country, its industries, social habits,
general aspect and so forth, is counselled to
frequent the Fraser lectures, which will occur to-
night (Thursday), and on the afternoon and even-
ing of Saturday.

A new record was established in “The
King of Cadonia” at Her Majesty’s last week.
Four different Regents appeared. When Gilbert
• retired to the shades of a private hospital, come-
dian Nable took his place. Meanwhile W. S. Percy
was summoned from Melbourne. Then Nable
fell ill, and the Regent’s heavy rble was taken at
about moments’ notice by Frank Stirling,
stage manager and producer of the show—an
heroic feat which panned out to the satisfaction
of all. Now the play has settled down peacably
with Percy, and is going great guns.

Strongly reminiscent in coloring of a
Dudley aide-de-camp at an official ball is the
souvenir programme issued by the Sydney Lieder-
tafel on the occasion of its 150th concert last week.
On a royal crimson ground the black lettering is
balanced with golden jim-jams surmounted by the
golden lyre and scroll of the society; and
in Saxe blue appear the names of the office-
bearers from 1882, the year of the Liedertafel’s
foundation, to the present year 1909. Mr.
F. C. Brewer tells (in Saxe blue) that
the institution is the oldest of the present musical
societies in the capital of N.S.W. It germinated
in the German Glee Club, founded and conducted
by late musician 0. B. Sussmilch. Both Melba
and Crossley were engaged by the Liedertafel
•whilst in the first dawn of their respective sqtig-
• careers. Melba sang with it in December oflBBs,
and Crossley made her first appearance in N.S.W.
with the Society in September of 1892. As well
as an incredible number of noted works by
masters, the Society has produced several
compositions by Australians. A cantata, “Cap-
tain Cook ’’—music by the late Mr. Delaney, words
by Mr. P. T. Quinn —met with a kindly reception
in 1888. A number of Mr. Alfred Hill’s com-
positions reached the collective ear through the
same medium, and Mr. Arundel Orchard’s two
operas (with librettos by Mr. W. JV.Curtis) were
welcome innovations. Last week, on the occasion
of its triumphantsouvenir programme, the Society
produced a third work by the r young gentleman
mentioned. “ Uller the Bowman” is it hight.
Mr- Orme Darvall enacted the gigantic Uller, the
god of winter, who, whilst snow-slioeing and firing
his divine arrows in the forest, meets Skadi
(Miss Rosina Buckmann), the daughter of another
•notability, the Storm Giant, who had had some
unpleasantness with the gods, and was conse-
quently destroyed. His daughter was apparently
out chasing her food on Uller’s preserves when she
met the god. Despite the fact that she was “in
warlike radiance,” helmeted and with chain-
mail and spear, he addresses her as “Thou
tender bud,” and proffers her his • name
and state and love and mantle. The
Dance of the Storms and Winds, in honor of
the marriage of their god. follows. Both music
■and words on the un-Australian subject are most
creditable to their composers. During the 28
years of the society’s existence its revenue, says
the programme, has totalled over £25 r OOO, alt of
which has been expended in the cause of music.

To the Sydney Tivoli last Saturday night
came Miss Atbmore Gray, a specialty dancer
with a remarkable high kick and two smart songs,
For the present the kick and the smart songs a)re
all that the patrons are allowed ; bht the bills
hint darkly at a “daring performaiiceithat has
caused something of a sensation elsewhere.” It
may be something extra-reckless on the high
trapeze; or, again, it may not. Most probably
it is not. Captain Winston’s religious-looking
seals continue to supply a large hunk of the pro-
gramme, and they earn all the noufishmOrlib
handed out to them. With the exception of the
small seal who huris the swear at the audience
when he tries to pick up the ball, the members of
the troupe have a middle-aged and serious
aspect which suggests that they have a mis-
sion in life, and that the frivolities they in-
dulge in are merely gone through in order
to provide funds for the Good Cause.
The sooner those seals get up to the Arctic
and talk seriously to the conflicting Pole-seekers,
the better it will be for humanity; truth and
charity seem to be almost as scarce as sunshine in
the remote North. The Kremka Brothers are
somersaulting off the bill even as this Bulletin is
speeding through the presses. Their successors
are the Wheelers, a trick cycle team who also do
their initial whirl at the same hurried time—
Tuesday evening. As regards the rest of the
show, the three jolly Sprightly Sisters have a
change of programme, and Blake and Granby a
new playlet; also Ronald George, instrumentalist,
who contrives to blow soulfully through brass in-
struments, raises the question : Did anyone ever
burst into tears at hearing a cornet solo ? Such an
exhibition is what the player on brass always
seems to puff at, and it would be interesting to
know if any human being has gratified the
ambition by letting himself go and busting as
aforesaid.

Of the making of moving pictures there is
no end. and in Sydney the Palace, the Lyceum
and Bijou shows draw larger crowds than
ever. Pictures have become a habit, not to say a
vice, and there are people going around who
would sooner miss two meals in the week than
their regular “ picture night.” Mostly, one pic-
ture show is equal to another, which is equal to
the same thing. At the Palace Mr. West is
showing a fine series, representing the passing of
Mozart; and while the gentleman with the
god-like face passes, the orchestra plays his
music. This was the sort of apotheosis that
even the imaginative Mozart never dreamed of.
The revival of the fearsome Red Hand picture-
bellowdrama has brought the “ Danse d’Apache”
once more on to the trembling screen ; and great
and wonderful is the welcome thereof. Another
good series depicts yachting at Cowes. At the
Lyceum the Theatrescope is illustrating literature
in the Man Without a Country series ; it is well
rendered and eminently suitable. The course of
the future will probably be, first, the publication
of the book ; then, the picturing of the story ;
and, finally, the dramatisation thereof. The Way
of the Man series is said to be humorous, but
it supplies a lot of material for grim reflection.
Anyhow, the way of the Man is picturable—no one
dreams of daring to put on the way of the Woman.
The theatrescope is also, responsible for a con-
siderable amount of evidence that Portugal and
the Riviera are good places to live in ; but it
would be more convincing if the machine could
reproduce smells, and throw around the fine atmo-
sphere of garlic. The Bijou provides two new
world-pioneering romances, a story of Old Mexico,
and a big range of pictures more or less comic.
To affirm that Oscar Asche’s production of
“ As You Like It,” which drew a great audience
to Melbourne Royal last Saturday, is the finest
setting of the comedy ever seen in Australia would
be unjust to the tradition of the beautiful show that
George Musgrove staged at the Princess’s six
years back. But in some respects it is the'most
artistic ; whilst, as regards the interpretation of
the play, this is undoubtedly the most advanced
performance up to date. The decorative absurd-
ities of the old productions have been replaced by
reasonably picturesque improvements. The exiled
Duke and his followers are now a shabby lot of
philosophers who take their meals in a sort of
cave, and make some pretence of being at odds
with civilisation. Even the Duke looks consider-
ably the worse for wear ; and as Asche presents
him, the melancholy Jaques is attired on hermit
lines—a dingy, baldheaded old misanthrope who
would scorn to wear a hat. One compares him
with many a Jaques who has prowled around in a
'lovely suit of brown velveteen or what not, and
one feels grateful to Oscar Asche. He doesn’t
make recitations of his moralisings. The oppor-
tunity to talk about the Seven Ages of Alan comes
when he is drinking some soup or blackberry
AS YOU LIKE IT.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Our world is full of problems hard, wherever you
may strike it;
Now, what did the Immortal Bard imply by
“As You Like It”?
The meaning of that title strange in vain has been
debated,
And, as a play, “0.K.” would say, the yarn is
over-rated ;
Its moral grace we must admire, but- cannot
understand-O,
How Rosalind in boy’s attire, deludes the young
Orlando;
Or why a place where folk abound, all free and
irrepressible,
Should be described as “savage” ground, and
“ desert inaccessible ” ;
There yokels tend the flocks and herds, nor speak
of life’s distresses,
Though townsmen tell of what occurred with
snakes and lionesses;
There cots and lands are up for sale, and shep-
herds work for wages,
When anyone, or girl or male, their services
engages;
There “old religious men” unite the billers and
the cooers
In holy bonds, or show the Light to would-be evil-
doers.
For such as love a picnic jaunt, or party in a
garden,
The most attractive pleasure haunt upon this
earth is Arden.
So full of virtue is its air that—so it is asserted—
A gory duke who ventures near gets suddenly
converted ;
Whilst brother Oliver, the brute ! forswears frater-
nal slaughter,
And captures with his winning suit the convert’s
charming daughter.
The exiles in that Forest green with friendly
natives mingle ;
When Hymen happens on the scene he leaves no
women single ;
For all, who by a happy chance, in Arden’s glades
have tarried,
Must moralise, or sing and dance, or joyfully get
married.
VICTORIA.

The musical embellishments are no longer
(’hg'gestive of a concert in the Town Hall. Amiens
is a very amateur songster, and the foresters make
no bid for an encore. The epilogue is introduced
epilogically, yet with charming effectiveness, by
Miss Brayton in the closing scene. This repre-
sents Rosalind’s cottage with forest environment
instead of an open stretch of country. You see
the place where she changes her clothes and goes
to “shut-eye” with Celia. A very pleasing Rosa-
lind is Miss Lily Brayton, animated, sentimental,
not conspicuously girlish in he,r alleged disguise,
though, as a matter of course, very pretty. It
isn t a subtle performance. For instance,
when the usurping Duke has ordered her
off the premises, her grief and agitation
are utterly dissipated by the thought of mas-
querading as a boy on her travels. Again, her
love for Orlando is indicated too pointedly. Her
changes of tone are a trifle theatrical. But this
tendency to emphasise the strength of Rosalind’s
feelings appears natural enough when she staggers
under the news that the young man lias been
fighting a savage lioness. As much of the Forest
as the audience doesn’t see is said to be full of
awful dangers. It’s a menagerie of wild beasts
and things. The parts the audience does see are
full of harmless people and comic relief. lan
Penny makes a passable Orlando, pictoriallv
and otherwise, but his part is underdone. Miss
Clement is not more than a satisfactory Celia;
a couple of parts are neatly and humorously
played by Tripp Edgar; and the heavy mono-
tony of Charles Doran’s voice is the only fault
in his performance of Oliver. The bright, easy
elocution of Kay Souper, as the banished Duke,
is more noticeable than the merit of the ladies
who play Audrey and Phoebe. The latter is an
unthankful character, anyhow. Probably Audrey
would seem more convincing if Touchstone (Athol
Forde) seemed more like the sort of motley fool
who would be likely to undertake the joke of
marrying her. There is no spirit of sententious
frivolity in his Touchstone. Divested of his trap-
pings he would hardly raise a laugh. If the
character was ever very funny, the secret of its
humor is lost; but a professional clown should at
least be a lively fellow, with brightness in his voice.
In “As You Like It,” as in “The Shrew,” the
old men parts are most interestingly played.
Caleb Porter is excellent as Corin, and Herbert
Grimwood creates an Adam who is so naturally
patriarchal that one might mistake him for old
Isaac or Jacob. Considering the strength of the
production in all its other scenic details, the weak-
ness of the wrestling match is surprising. Charles
the Champion is a mere apology for a Hacken-
schmidt, and the arrangement of his downfall is
ridiculously simple. A special feature of the
forest scenery is the real green stuff—ferns,
saplings, etc.—earted from Macedon for the
occasion. The smell of earth and the odor of
vegetation is actually wafted over the footlights.
But as to whether the mingling of mimic trees
with bona-fide ferns is high art, the Bulletin has
its doubts.

Against a background of black velvet,
“Julius Caesar” will be presented at the Town
Hall on the afternoon of Saturday (25th). Oscar
Asche and Co. will recite the play in Roman
attire. Just now the prospective Marc Antony is
busily engaged in training a crowd of supers in
the way they ought to get excited when he orates
to them of the decaeasared Julius.
** * *
“ 0.K.” has a genuine grievance :
The one glaring fault in Oscar Asche’s setting of
“ Othello ” is its disrespectful treatment of Emilia in the
closing scene. Emilia, of course, is the real heroine of
the murder scene. She comes bouncing into the bed-
room, and, when she finds that the black man has mur-
dered his wife, she curses him for a colored fool and
alarms the neighborhood. There’s no bated breath about
Emilia when her blood’s up. She just d—ns the dog of
war and cries “Murder ! ” The neighbors having burst
upon the scene, with her husband among them, Emilia
tackles him as to the truth of Othello’s allegations, and
as soon as she discovers that he had been villainously
pulling the black’s leg, she’s the most rampant matron
in C3'prus. The silent voices of the audience
say “Good old Emilia!” Othello’s mention of
the handkerchief business reveals to her the full
depth of lago’s deceit, and she throws prudence to the
winds. Her husband bids her shut up, but she can’t shut
up. All the woman in her is aroused. Fine idea that a
wife should be murdered by a jealous husband to whom
she was ridiculously loyal! “She was too fond of her
filthy bargain,” says Emilia to the gullible darkie.
“ Filthy bargain ” is a crusher under the circumstances.
Emilia has got both the men beaten. No more matri-
monial slavery for her. She is not going to live anymore
with lago. Handkerchief, indeed ! She blows the gaff
upon that precious handkerchief, and then her infuriated
husband stabs her, before bolting from the bedroom. By
all the rules of fair play, Emilia is entitled to the centre of
the stage to die in. She should be allowed to make a
fuss over her decease, for she was the whole book of
revelations. But in order that Othello’s remorse may get
all the limelight the wounded Emilia has to retire to the
o.p. side, utter her dying lines to the Moor from an angle
of 45 degrees, and blot herself out in a high-backed chair
where she is lost to the audience’s sight. Poor Mrs. lago
Is left sitting dead with none to do her reverence. She’s
the most neglected corpse on record.

At Her Majesty’s, this is the third week
of “ The Duchess of Dantzic,” and that estimable
matron is singing to her hand-mirror as before.
For the moment, however, a new Duchess handles
the mirror, because on Monday a taxi-cab had the
bad grace to choose the time when Florence
Youtig was a passenger to upset itself; and so the
old-established Duchess is nursing a broken rib.
Last week’s mention of the show calls for a word
of modification. Empress Josephine is not un-
amiable to the Duchess as compared with
Napoleon’s two sisters, of whom Miss Nellie
Wilson is the more aggressively scornful.
Josephine (Miss Alma Vaughan) makes no
appearance until the third act, and then she only
reproves the Duchess in a low-spirited way—more
in sorrow than in anger. In fact, she is a tearful,
rather than a sneerf ul, Josephine.

“ The Bushwoman ” continues to supply
an Australian want at the King’s. The machina-
tions of the villain are weak in conception, and
the villain’s alleged passion for the heroine is in-
consistent with his impoliteness to her, or vice-
versa ; but the drama has some home truths and
character types in it. The pore farmer and his
family are matters of fact, and when the old man
complains that prices are bad if seasons are good,
the sentiment is received with a hearty smile of
recognition. Still even this old friend must go,
for on Saturday another melodrama will arrive
from Britain, “For the Man She Loves.” The
present Anderson season at the King’s has only
another three weeks to run, and then Bland Holt
comes from Sydney with his co.

“Sherlock Holmes,” with Thomas King-
ston as the wonderful morphia subject, saw the
footlights at Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday
last, and Professor Moriartv was trapped as usual.
In the present production Gregan McMahon is
the aged villain who endeavors to slay the
frigid detective by shooting him through a'
hat. He is not so picturesquely repulsive in
the part as J. B. Atholwood ; but he is convincing
all the same. Nellie Calvin, as Alice Faulkner,
burgles the affections of Sherlock almost as
attractively as May Chevalier did of yore; and
Harry Plimmer glitters as James Larrabee, the
highly-polished villain. On Saturday next “The
Silver King” will return for six nights; and as
old friend Titlieradge is to be the sorrowful
monarch with the whitewashed hair, the Prin-
cess’s should be a crowded edifice.

Wirth’s new Skating Rink, in Wirth’s
Park, n6e Princes Court, Melbourne, opened its,
doors to the multitude for the first time last
Saturday night. The Rink lured a throng on
Saturday that was both numerous and appetis-
ing. As for the Rink itself, it is palatial,
without, being monstrous; is electric lit;
has a sliding roof; and possesses 30,000 square
feet of reinforced concrete floor, as smooth and
polished as the poll of the average Bulletin bard.
Altogether, the rink looks like becoming the
Mecca of the roller-skater, although one thing
seems wanting—a fernery (with plenty of dark
and vegetation), as an annexe for outdoor refresh-
ment in the summer weather.

Three nice young Sisters Trapnell and
their energetic brother George have brought an
aerobatic tumbling “turn” to the Opera House;
also Graham and Dent have changed their sketch
to “Me and Her.” Otherwise the bill this week
is the same document which Rickards negotiated
last week, and Melbourne is going to the Dogs as
before. Rosina’s Dogs, however, will soon steer
their bark to another port; and another aching
void will be left when Florence and Lilian blow
their last trump.

Amy Castles and Chung Ling Soo are
dividing Adelaide’s enthusiasm and cash between
them. Both are beautifully attired, and both are
gems at their art. The lady, at the Town Hall, is
assisted by a strong little company, including
Peter Dawson, who gets a tremendous reception
on his native heath. The conjurer, at the Tivoli,
haslost R. H. Douglass and the “ Meisters,” who
have left for Europe; but Ted Kalman and the
Duckworths have come in. Of the rinks, that at
Olympja (which is the old Cyclorama) has gone
out of business, and West’s Pictures are to make
it their summer home. And miscellaneous con-
certs are everywhere.
“S.S.”: The Keen On Waller (K.0.W.) Club, mentioned
in The Bulletin a couple of years back, as the Keen
Order of Wallerites, is still in existence in London. The
longevity of this quaint organisation proves that females
are not fickle where adorable actors are concerned.
Lewis Waller has a son old enough to he an idol, but
Lewis the Swashbuckler still commands the loyal devo-
tion of the above club or chapel, the members' of which
are all women with the means to maintain expensive
rooms in a swagger Cockney locality for the express pur-
pose of being Keen On Waller in company. They co-
operate in beingfearfultykeen on the middle-aged gentle-
man at fixed intervals, they attend all his first nights
and give him a hooray reception, and the walls of their
club are blazoned with his press notices, his photographs,
and records of his momentous doings. Also, a Waller
bust is conspicuously placed to receive the devotions of
the faithful.
ANOTHER BLACK HAND OUTRAGE.
“Synic”: Why do these mummer-managers whose
names are identified with farcical comedy persist in try-
ing to gain public acceptance as the heroes of “ pretty ”
pieces? Charles Arnold, after making a fortune out of
“ What Happened to Jones,” developed a weakness for
“ The Professor’s Love Story,” a very sentimental comedy
in which he figured as a dear old gentleman, assisted by
soft music. The public wouldn’t have it; but Arnold
practically paid for the pleasure of dropping into pathos.
He would withdraw a money-making farce in order to
play “The Prof.’s Love Story” at a loss. So it was
with Frank Thornton and his “ Little Ray of Sunshine.”
He doted on the sickly sentimentality of the “ Little
Ray,” and gratified his passion at the expense of
“Charley’s Aunt.” And lately we have had Hugh Ward
—with less strength of personality than Arnold or Thorn-
ton—producing himself as “The Fencing Master,” a
rather wearisome old gentleman who never does or says
a funny thing the livelong night. Hugh Ward evidently
fancies himself as a high-class tragical comedian.
Knowing himself to be a more graceful and in-
telligent citizen, and more of an artist at heart than
the ordinary mummer, he thinks he is able to “ lose
himself ” in a sentimental character, and melt an audi-
ence to tears. Ward, with his nimble dancing legs, his
muffled monotone, and his acquired skill in playing the
refined fool (who is an old fool in his best characters),
is not less mistaken in his estimate of his capa-
bilities than the broad low comedian who aspires to
play Richard the Third. As compared with many a
chuckle-headed fellow of coarser fi«re, Ward is a weak
mummer. He hasn’t the emotional force of a successful
commercial traveller persuading a customer into buying
a “ cheap line” of goods at something above trade value.
His conception of a serious character may be clever, but
his presentation of his ideal is unconvincing. The effect
of dramatic power is not there. He feels the part and
acts it cleverly enough ; but his voice and action cannot
convey his feelings to the audience. And if they could —
what then? The Australian public has no use for these
“pretty pieces.” If “The Professor’s Love Story” and
“ A Little Ray of Sunshine” were failures, what chance
was there for a play so wildly impossible as “ The Fencing
Master ” ?
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Star” : The Asche season in Melbourne has served to
stir up disgusted oppositipn to the advertising curtain,
an abomination that was little regarded so long as it
merely fell between the spasms of melodrama. The jam-
label drop scene was on the same artistic level as the play
in those days, and there was a certain fitness about
things. But when the flaring beer advt. or the urgent
appeal of the liver medicine came between the acts of
“ Othello,” or intruded on the delicate beauty of “As
You Like It,” it grew to be an outrage. The Asches were
strongly moved to abolish the thing; but the beer and
corset people had contracts, and wouldn’t be abolished.
“Silas”: Seeing Oscar Asche’s bit of broad and bulky
comedy as the tinker, Christopher Sly, I’m wondering if
he can be tempted to give us his idea of Falstaff. Tom
Bent is the finest impersonation of Falstaff Melbournians
have ever seen, so far as externals go ; but few Aus-
tralians have seen Falstaff at all, and it seems a pity that
we should be denied a sight of Shak-peare’s very finest
comedy character. What I should like would be “The
Merry Wives of Windsor,” with as much of Falstaff lifted
from “ Henry IV.” as could be conveniently conveyed by
a smart adapter. My conscience does not prick me for
the iniquity of this meddling.
“Montalex”: A Melbourne medico, commenting on
the fact that the Othello of Oscar Asche dies standing,
declares that the thing would be “physically impossible
to a man who had received such a wound.” Mere theory 1
This dogmatic doctor may have seen many stabbed men,
but the chances are that he has never seen a man stabbed.
Now, I have—many ; and, except in one case where the
weapon directly pierced the heart, the victim never fell
to the blow. Indeed the stage itself is largely responsible
for the notion that a stabbed man goes down with a
crash, though it compensates by allowing him there-
after to raise himself upon his elbow and make an exten-
sive oration, or warble a long and intricate solo, like
Edgardo, in “Lucia.” Now for facts. I have known a
fatally-stabbed seaman hold on to a belaying-pin and de-
liver himself of much energetic cuss-language before he
could be removed by force. Also I once saw, in Sourabaya,
a Javanese, who had received three ghastly and indivi-
dually fatal kris-wounds, start to walk to the hospital.
Of course, the frightful hemorrhage did not let him walk
far, but that is not my point. Another of the stage’s
little weaknesses is its backhanded grip—little finger
nearest the blade—of its dagger, poniard, stiletto or
other piece of minor cutlery. How the cross-handled
dagger was held is well seen in Sydney Art Gallery’s
“ Bideford Sands”; and, as far as modern times are con-
cerned, I have never seen any Dago, when on perforation
bent, hold his snicker-snee projecting backwards—stage
fashion—from his hand. Held the other way, the weapon
can be accurately directed by the thumb, and is much
less likely to be accidentally deflected against the person
of the user.
“Vulcan”: The big rush for the Asche-Brayton’s
Sydney “first night” tickets (nearly 300 have been
applied for so far) inspires the Meynell and Gunn manage-
ment to put up all the box, circle and stall seats to the
highest bidder at auction. So far as I can remember, this
has only been done twice before in Sydney—first, for
Sarah Bernhardt’s ’way-back “ first night,” and again for
the official opening of the present Her Majesty’s Theatre,
when a hotch-potch programme was given for charity.
In the latter case circle seats fetched as high as twelve
guineas. In the present instance M. and G. will probably
find that “ first night” hankering is one thing, and pay-
ing through the nose for the doubtful privilege is another.
“ The Taming of the Shrew ” is now having a music-
hall run in London, at the Holborn Empire. Matheson
Lang, one of the most striking of modern Hamlets, has
had it boiled down into a duologue (!), and runs through
the essential parts of it —with his wife as Katharine—in
about 20 minutes. “Hamlet” itself had been similarly
treated before, not, however, as a duologue, but as a 20-
minute “ sketch.”
Harry Shine, the clever comedian who died in St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital (Sydney) last Saturday and was buried at
Waverley on Monday, was, as he himself said, “in the
neighborhood of 40 years of age.” As a solemn matter
of fact he was 38. His last part was that of the Scare-
crow in “ Jack and Jill,” and though he was a dying man
he did it well. Henry Shine (though no one ever called
him Henr3') had been about 20 years in Australia, and
was beginning to suffer from the lamentable fact that
people hardly remembered he was imported. He had a
brother, Wilfrid Shine, who blossomed here for a little
while with the luckless “ Morocco Bound ” show-, and in
one or two other events. The Shines were both clever,
but Harry Shone the brighter of the two. He never did
an3-thing badly, and if he had gone to bed earlier o’
nights he might have gladdened large audiences for an-
nother 20 3'ears or more.
VV. B. Fair, just dead in London, was famous 35 years
back as the chief singer of an alleged comic song :
“ Tommy, make room for 3'our uncle,
There’s a little dear ;
Tommy, make room for your uncle,
I want him to sit here.”
Depressing as the effusion seems, it caught the public
fancy immensely. It was played, surig and whistled
everywhere. At last Robert Browning got angry and
immortalised it in one of his astounding rh3'mes :
“ Treading down rose and ranunculus,
You ‘Toinmy-make-room-for-y’our-uncle’ us!
Troop—all of you 1 man or homunculus ! ”
“Locust”: Curious to me that Australia, the most
horsey country in the world, has never produced a horse-
drama worth ad —n. Also, that we haven’t got a single
equestrian statue —I can’t remember one—in an3 r of our
cities. Our one Australian genius-sculptor, Mackennal,
has never done an equestrian figure. He sticks to the
“female form divine.” What a fine effect equestrian
figures have in sculpture 1 There are no sculptures so
impressive to me as the “bareback” rider, Marcus
Aurelius on the Capitoline Hill, in Rome ; the Frederick
the Great in the Unter den Linden, Berlin ; or the fine
equestrian figure of Hideyoshi (modern) in the square
outside the palace at Tokyo. Then there is the
splendid mounted Colleoni, by Verrocchio, in Venice;
the Coeur de Lion outside the House of Commons.; the
squat and ugl.v but impressive Victor Emmanuels (all
over Italy); and even the Duke of Wellington, which used
to be on Constitution Hill. I would give my mite
towards a national statue to Adam Lindsay Gordon on
horseback. What a subject his “ sick stockrider ” would
make for a group in bronze !
Miss Ethel Hunt, who had faded out of Australian
notice for nine or 10 years, is on the way home to Sydney,
where George Rignold “discovered” her as a youngster
and fed her with ingenue parts. She crossed over to
taste the timber ham in the late ’nineties, and since then
has been with Klaw and Erlanger and other N. Yorkers,
though she figured with Walter Bentley in his Shak-
spearian revivals in ’Frisco and thereabouts. Primarily
Miss Hunt comes this way to see mother ; but if a,
manager happens along the chances are that she won t
bite him.
Beecham, of pill fame, having given £lOO,OOO to found
a new opera-house in London, the Sporting Times suggests
that the price of admission should be a guinea a box.
“ Harrison O.” : Foster Fraser, the old young man who
has seen more cities than Ulysses ever dreamed of, is a
bright and entertaining lecturer. He eschews oratorical
embellishment, and, like the Moorish coon who murdered
Desdemona, unfolds “a round, unvarnished tale.” (I
may mention, by way of a side issue, that Fraser’s jokes,
which are of the bath bun or Sunday-school picnic order,
are extremely poor.) He does not indulge in long descrip-
tive passages, but simply tells you about things in a plain,
matter-of-fact manner which is extremely effective. He
claims your attention bj' his offhand manner of de-
livering phrases such as “ When a man, like myself,
spends his life knocking round the world.” There
is not a suspicion of “skite” in his way of saying
such things. The best part of his lecture, “ Through
Russia in Revolution,” was the final five minutes
he gave standing in the- limelight after all the
lantern pictures had been shown. He summed up the
state of affairs in the country of unpronounceable town-
names very concisely. If Russia were to obtain really
Responsible Government, the Jews, who are the most
intellectual people in the country, would be returned to
Parliament in large numbers ; and when the Russians
awoke to a realisation of the fact that they were being
governed by an alien race, more gore would be. spilt than
Bland Holt's stipendiary villain has shed ever since Bland
took to the show business. Yet the statement is uncon-
vincing. If the Russian hates Levi the Jew so badly that
he would start doing wholesale murder when he found
that he had Levi for his member, how does it come that
he so loves Levi the Jew that he would vote for him till
•his Parliament was full of Levi ?
“The Merry Widow’s” London run has just stopped,
after extending for over two years—67B performances, to
be exact. The last night was a big occasion ; large pre-
miums were paid for booked seats, and the queue for the
unreserved parts(evening performance) began to assemble
soon after daybreak ! Except for short holidays, the
same principals—Lily Elsie, Joseph Coyne and Robert
Evett —were in the cast all through the long voyage.
Bill Anderson is growing more and more thoughtless in
his enterprises—for which the Lord forgive him, for this
paper never can. His latest dereliction is the purchase
of the Australian rights of Hall Caine’s “The Christian,”
somewhat altered and adapted. It seems that Hall is
changing in his outlook on Glory Quailed and John
Cyclone, and he is booming the revised version to show
his reversed vision.
Melbourne Hippodrome has changed its name for better
or worse. It is now alluded to in numerous advertise-
ments as “ Majestic Square,” and defies anybody to notice
the difference. Formerly the old place was given up to
bellowdrama of a particularly sanguinary description, and
used to attract herds of the Alf and Benno type at prices
ranging from about 9d. in the reserved seats to about
in the pit. The edifice is now, however, the de-
pressed and respectable residence of a picture show, and
adopts its new name to recognise its promotion in repute.
Still it is hard to see why it has been called “ Majestic
Square.” Even a blind man can scent that that is only
an alias.
Pretty Miss Betty Ohls McQuade finished her Jill
engagement in the panto. “ Jack and Jill ” in Wellington
(M.L.) yesterday ; and Miss Nance Maher, who was the
Fairy Queen in the same musical joke, is her successor.
The youthful McQuade pair will be in Sydney for a space
before going to America, where they will most likely buy
a ranch and lead the strenuous life raising the simple
Texan steer. No more footlights for Betty unless she be
before and not behind them.
Anti-Sosh has actually got on to the stage in London.
The argument of a new curtain-raiser, “The Cause of
Lady Peggy,” runs thus. Peggy, being a little fool, tells
her lover that she has become a Socialist. “ I know the
sort,” he remarks ; “ wear their hair long, no collar, and
never wash.” (Laughter.) She has to be headed off
somehow. So he tells her that he has become a Socialist
too, and (therefore) does not believe in marriage, and so
they will live in “intellectual comradeship.” (Much
laughter.) Then, of course, she takes it all back. The
little piece has no “ purpose ” ; but its calm assumption
of the repudiation-of-marriage lie is perhaps more shock-
ing than if it pretended to argue.
“Melb.”: Majestic Square is the new name of the
Hippodrome, opposite Her Majesty’s Theatre, in Exhi-
bition-street, Melbourne. Exhibition-street used to be
Stephen-street, with a flavor like that of Romeo-lane and
Juliet-terrace, which have also been re-christened.
Majestic Square, in the Stephen-street days, first came
into note with Rowe’s Circus, which drove out Noble’s
Circus, on the corner of Spring and Bourke streets, after-
wards the Salle de Valentino. When Rowe’s Circus had
folded up its tent, like the Bedouins, Coppin’s Olympic
replaced it on Majestic Square, which is perilously near
the formerly celebrated Bilking Square. The Olympic
was an iron theatre, bought by Coppin in England, so
that he and Brooke might not be at the mercy of Jacky
Tommy Smith, Melbourne’s Whittington, seven times
mayor, who owned the Queen’s Theatre. Coppin with
the Olympic, figuratively speaking, in his pocket, came
from London by the steamer Argo, as also did Henry
Gyles Turner. But this story is drifting away from
Majestic Square.
The Spanish bull-fight is even more horrible than con-
temptible, but the French imitation of Spain’s national
“ sport ” is even more contemptible than horrible,
seemingly. A brief sketch of a b'ull-flght at Marseilles,
last month, comes from Miss Phyllis Miller, of Melbourne,
a young Australienne who makes no pretence of “ nerves.”
Writing from Marseilles on a Sunday she says:—“We
were persuaded to go to a bull-fight. Everyone said we
might never get the chance again, so six of us went. It
was an awful sight. The bull was dazed and streaming
with blood from the darts in his neck, and when the
toreador stepped into the ring and stabbed him in the
neck the crowd rose and cheered. Why, an Australian
bushman would not waste time on such a miserable
business. Next they brought in a fresh bull and two
picadors on blindfolded horses. This bull was rather
more lively than the previous one, and he promptly gored
the two dejected-looking horses, who had absolutely no
hope to get away. But at this point I got away, and
never stopped running till I was out on the tram line.
In the future, I will view bull-fights at the picture shows.

IN THE STALLS.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
When peanuts, plump and crisp, come down,
A not too gentle evening shower
From the high gods, we flinch and frown,
And though the play be gay, we cow'er
Beneath the dreadful rain that falls
On us, bareheaded in the stalls.
The play may cheerful be, or dull;
We cannot tell —the peanut-pod,
The gloomy, moist banana-hull !
This manna of the gallery god
Descends, and bounces as it falls
On blokes bald-headed in the stalls.
Peculiarly this manna drops
To brim the stout, staid stalKce’s cup ;
It falls, and makes him mad r, s hops.
When lights are down an/i glasses up
The baldies and the very tails,
They get the peanuts, in the stalls.
The god has his own atmosphere.
What though the play be gay or grim,
Let us aloft, exhaling beer,
And laugh or weep, and chew with him,
The joyous bloke that caterwauls
And throws dead luggage in the stalls !

What has become ot all those nice plump girls

“ They are mostly staying at home waiting till
the fashion in girls changes.”
A poor, foolish “bob” fortune-teller of
Glebe (Sydney), who was let off the other day
under the First Offenders Act, might have inspired
more sympathy if she hadn’t been such a harmless
little ass. Her client was a huge, disguised
policeman, whose chest nearly crowded her out of
the room. She told him (1) that a watch had been
stolen from him—nothing maddens a policeman
more than to be told that goods have been stolen
from him; and (2) that he had a weak consump-
tive chest—his chest was like an elephant’s trunk,
or a Saratoga—and that he should drink cod-liver
oil, wear flannels, and give up office work. Then
the disgusted giant tramped out and very
naturally laid an information. He probably felt
as Samson-Hercules would have done if told to
take gentle exercise on an empty stomach and try
a mild tonic.

Another Victorian school (at Boho), has
been deserted, parents absolutely refusing to send
their children to the cold, leaky, mouldy, germ-
infested, ant-eaten hovel. This makes about the
tenth or twelfth strike within the last few months
against the collapsed Education Department of
John Weary's State—that same tired old Weary
who reckoned he could find £1,000,000 towards a
Dreadnought, dig out enough money to
prevent the old schoolhouse tumbling on the head
of the State’s all too scarce infant. In the Boho
case, the parents two years ago bought a block of
land and presented it to the Department as a new
school site, and now they consider it time to give
Minister Billson a shove.

The sanctity of Costs was revealed in full
to the lay world last week, when a Victorian
solicitor argued seriously and at great length
about a missing Tuppence. The function took
place at Ballarat, where time is plentiful; had it
been in the city, where the same substance is
scarce, someone might have thrust Sixpence into
his hand, with a muttered injunction to clear out
and keep the change. The immense matter of
the Tuppence arose through the carelessness of a
small debtor. It appears that he had been sued,
and a verdict being obtained against him for
28s. 2d., had written out a cheque for 28s. and
ignored the Tuppence. In asking for an order
for the Tuppence and 15s. more Costs, the
hungry solicitor explained that it wasn’t the
Tuppence he was fighting for so much as the holy
cause of Costs. The chairman of the Bench would
willingly have given the tramfare out of his own
pocket, and he frankly told the worried legal per-
son with the horsehair on his mind that it was an
absurd proceeding, and that he did not feel like
making an order for 15s. Costs on a claim of Two
Coppers. After this passage, more time smould-
ered away before it was discovered that the ser-
vice of the writ was bad. At that point, the box—
it wasnlt big enough to be a case—was thankfully
adjourned by the chairman for two weeks ; so the
price of a stamp is still hanging in the balance and
the Law will have to lose fourteen nights’ sleep be-
fore it knows its fate.

“ Montalex ” : A word or two about the
so-called “ pea-rifle ” and its appalling record of
I write so-called ” because the pea-
rple proper (now obsolete) was a long, heavy arm,
shooting a very smMl spherical bullet with great
accuracy up to 150yds. or so. But since the
unexpected-death-dealer is mostly a 22-calibre,
taking a bullet of less than diameter, the
appellation may pass. For the numerous acci-
dental slayings there are two main reasons.
When I, as a lad, was first entrusted with the
then universal muzzle-loader, I had to assimilate
quite a little code of instructions—
such as resting the gun-butt, when
ramming, upon a boot-toe well off the
ground ; letting go the ramrod as it
went home and jerking the hand out
of the way of a possible explosion ;
and so on. This, of course, has
nothing to do with the matter in hand,
except as showing how carefully we
were then trained to the gun. But
what does bear directly on the subject
is the fact that continual admonition
rendered it automatic with me to carry
the gun always either shouldered,
with the muzzle well in the air, or
* under-arm, with the chance qf put-
ting an accidental charge of shot
only into the earth. Now, how is
it with the average bush lad ? (I
speak from experience.) All he knows
about a rifle is just how to load and
fire it. He handles it, loaded, as if it
were a riding-switch ; he carries it in
any and every position; and when
there are several youths and several
rifles in company—well, it’s a miracle
that the casualty-list isn’t longer than
it is. The other point is that many
of these small-calibre rifles are of the
very cheapest make, the working
parts being of soft metal that wears away
till the rifle gets into such a condition that
a very trifling shock will discharge it. Many
accidents are doubtless due to this cause, but the
chief contributor to the burial list is careless
handling and carrying.
A citizen of Melbourne is calling loudly
across the seas to Chapman and Alexander to
come back and complete the botched conversion
of a brand whom they plucked from the brimstone.
There was a young man named Friedhamski,
or thereabouts, who'last year came into collision
with the Vic. police over a matter of some stolen
references and coin. He alleged that his pa, an
Austrian millionaire, would be all broken up if he
heard of his son’s disgrace ; but the police averred
that pa was a tenth-rate London pawnbroker, and
that the young man had been sent to Australia for
his pa’s and his country’s good. Anyhow, that
episode ended with “six months’ hard.” Hansski
next appeared on the' Chapzander penitent form
and advertised his conversion fervently. He was
obviously a Continental Jew ; but so much the
better for the Chapz.anders, who were eager for
shining examples, wherefore they swallowed his
loud professions and ran him as part of the show.
Then he became acquainted with Smith. Smith,
who manages a city coffee palace, was a convert of
Torrey and Alexander; so he ttiok Ski to his
bosom, and communed with him, until finally he
felt so sure of Boiledbeefski’s conversion that he :
handed him the day’s takings to bank for him.
There was £lBO altogether, mostly in gold, notes
and silver - —and if anybody has seen a Yiddish-
looking youth, with a' penchant for barmaids and
chorus girls and with more cash than seems neces-
sary, Smith would be very glad to hear of him.
John Premier Murray, talking flamboy-
antly to the Rechabites of Kew (Melb.), referred
to the sweet reasonableness and charitableness of
modern teetotal advocates as compared with the
raging Rechs. of yore. “ There were days,” said
the gentle convert, “when the most intemperate
men in the land were some of our temperance
orators.” Then he went on to speak of how he
(Murray) had been criticised in the Argus for his
temperance oratory. “ I don’t know who wrote
the article,” he murmured. “As to the opinions
of that scribbler, I wonder if he had any qualms
of remorse as he blew the froth from his pewter
in the back room of some pub in the slums, sup-
ported by his bottle-nosed, blotch-faced brethren.”
After that, it can only be said that if the mild-
languaged Rechabite of to-day is a vast improve-
ment on his violent predecessor, then Slurk, the
bygone Rechabite, must have been what the push
calls “ a fair cow.”
PEART S GRIEVANCE.
Peary alleges that Cook took “ his Eskimo ” for his Polar journey—the journey he says Cook didn't
make. But, after all, if Cook found the Arctic cab waiting on the stand why shouldn’t he hire it?
From the Old Soldier :
One way and another the little Greek army gets a lot of
excitement. The other day the cable mentioned that
Captain Lobsteropiilos and his brother officers had put
their heads together and, finding that most of the army
the milk in the cocoanut, it was mentioned that the
Kind’s sons had resigned their positions in the
army. That ought to be something to the good
of the army, anyway; the amazing thing is
that the army has stood them so long. The
eldest son was Commander-m-Chief in the war
with Turkey 12 years ago ; he then made his Chamber-
lain, Sapuntsakis, Chief of the Staff, with one Hajipetres,
a notorious diner and eater of ricii food, Adjutant-
General. As a result the staff’s baggage and cooking
were the only things looked after. It was these people
who were blamed for the shameful abandonment of Larissa
without an attempt to defend its strong works. Even
before the war there was a mild mutiny in the Greek
army as a result of irregular promotions; but it was
smoothed over somehow, and the princes were allowed to
remain to do more damage.

In Sydney the other day a jury delivered
what Judge Murray regarded as a preposterous
verdict of “Not Guilty.” Judge Murray spoke
about it with unobtrusive frankness, and these
jurymen were allowed to do no further duty at
the sittings. That made them feel glad that they
had returned the alleged preposterous verdict.
Other jurors had to do extra duty in consequence,
and it made them feel wild ; but at the moment
they didn’t quite understand the situation. Now
they are probably resolved that next time the
accused kills his victim with an axe at noon in the
middle of Pitt-street they will find him “ not
guilty,” and recommend him for charitable relief.
Then they may also get off any more jury work.

wildly absurd verdicts. And it is almost equally

for giving absurd verdicts, and an incentive to
others to do likewise.

THE ENDURING TRIFLE.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
London, Wednesday Afternoon.—Professor Edgar
Hewitt has discovered in North-East Arizona caves much
larger than the celebrated Mammoth Caves of Kentuckv.
He also discovered ruins, relics and household articles—
the remains of a race unknown to arehasologists.—CeiMe.
When you and I and the crowd next door,
The ones we love and those we abhor,
The friend, the foe and the deadly bore,
Are mixed as clay,
What will survive of this crowded life,
The old dog-chain or the carving knife,
Ora hairpin dropped by someone’s wife?
It’s hard to say.
(The trifles last when the great things smash,
And prophecy is a practice rash
joints—to-morrow we’re hash—
Which does not pay.)
When you and I and the work we did
In the drifted sands are safely hid,
And the old Earth is for ever rid
Of us—and it—
Guess if you can what small remains
Will indicate our lofty brains?
A mayoral chair or a work of Caine’s
Deep in a pit?
One of the two, or a third. Perhaps
This plea pathetic to blokes and chaps
Will stare at the one who delves and taps—
“ Please, Do Not Spit.”
When you and I in our pride uprise
And laud ourselves to the blushing skies,
He still is flying who always flies
With might and main ;
While still in much vanity arrayed,
To rest in the files the speech is laid,
And the world runs on more or less afraid
It’s missed the train.
What will last, think you, of all the heap
Through the lost and countless years of sleep ?
Most likely a shirt-stud small and cheap
And very plain !
When you and I and the crowd next door,
The ones we love and those we abhor,
The friend, the foe and the friendless bore,
From life are thrust,
What will survive of our strange job lot ?
Probably only an iron pot

Perpetual Motion.
When George Stephenson was asked,
'• Do you believe in perpetual motion ? ”
he replied, “Yes, if you lift yourself bv
the waist-band of the trousers, and carry
yourself three times round the room.”
Just so, and a woman would just as
soon believe that she has not to pay dearly
for common soaps, in the low quality
of soap, in ruined hands and clothes.
She would be kept in perpetual motion
trying to do with common soap what sin
could so easily do with Sunlight Soap.

THE
1909 PANAMA.
We illustrate here the Panama that
reveals fashion’s latest characteristics.
The new shapes show brims with
sharp turned-up edges and crowns
squarer and fuller. The effect is a
very finished one, imparting a good
tone to one’s dressing.
However, we still have the wider
brim styles for those who prefer them,
each being sufficiently wide to afford
ample protection from the sun.
The plaiting is of very fine straw,
unvarying in its pure white color ; in
weight, extremely light; and head
conforming.
When ordering, give hat size and
width of brim desired. Widths of
brim from 2Jin. to 3Jin.

“ Wang ” pays a well-earned tribute to the
Melbourne police :
Melbourne is beginning to be talked about as the
burglars and murderers’ paradise. The gibe is merited.
In Brighton there were no less than a dozen robberies
in one week, and in not one case was the offender caught;.
The police of this particular suburb can’t stand the cold
weather, and they don’t like the dark at all, so they
rarely venture outside the radiance of the Lux lights up at
the railway station. When they do, the alert burglar
promptly gets his jemmy to work on the station build-
ings, and helps himself to whatever is handy in the hook-
ing or parcels offices. Never before in the history of Mel-
bourne were its blue-bottles looked upon with so much
contempt, and the average householder doesn’t bother to
shriek “Police!” now-a-nights when an intruder
appears on his premises. He simply bucks in
with the poker or whatever comes handiest. If
he is successful in outing the intruder (when he
isn’t he just waits for the doctor or the undertaker)
he grabs him b.v the whiskers, and hauls him off to the
nearest bright light, and hands him over to the waiting
John. The other night a man was half-murdered bj' a
gang of roughs, and a passing cabby discovered him, and
carted him off to the nearest bright light, under which
a John was of course found. John got into the cab
hastily, and told the cabby to drive like H— to the hospi-
tal ; and, the cabby obeying, John was carried every
minute farther away from the scene of the outrage. It
never occurred to him (or, if it did, he promptly let it
disoccur) to send the cabby on to the hospital with the
victim, and then to make a bee-line for the place where
the outrage had occurred, and where the gang probably
was at that moment dividing the spoil.
THAT DREADFUL BOY.
HOPE OF THE FAMILY : “Do you play cards ,
uncle? ”
RICH UNCLE: “No, indeed! But why do you

HOPE OF THE FAMILY: “’Cos I heard pa tell ma
that if she wos to play ’cr cards well with

The recent death of a young British peer—
Lord de Clifford—offered a picturesque oppor-
tunity for grovel on the part of a typical British
farmer. The deceased was motoring along a
narrow rcuid when a sharp turn brought him face
to face with a farmer’s waggon. To have run
into the horses and waggon would have meant an
awful smash up for the young man in the motor.
Had he lived to pay for the damage to the massive
vehicle that blocked the road, he must have been
shockingly disfigured and maimed. Picture a
lord lying amidst the wreckage of an overturned
motor beneath the body of an upset waggon, with
a few.tons of hay or taters on top of the confusion,
and a couple of cart horses kicking ! The unfor-
tunate toff found himself between Beelzebub and
the adjacent ditch. His only possible chance of
escaping with a few bruises was to turn his
infernal machine off the track. He had the
presence of mind to do so, but his luck was out.
Providence demanded the last penalty of his folly
in motoring madly round sharp turns on a narrow
country road. The grovelling Tory farmer said to
the coroner, “His Lordship chanced his life to
save mine.” And the Melbourne Alices headed
its cable report of the inquest with, “Peer's Self-
Sacrifice.’’ Some lords are born nobles, some
achieve the title by bullion or bloodshed, and all
have nobility thrust upon them by the Tory press.
NO SUCH
LUCK.
PARSON'S DAUGHTER:
“ You shouldn’t quarrel. Think of your

his wife. You should consider yourself lucky.”

The man on the roads whose business it is
to look for business represents modern commerce
in its most wasteful mood. He is a sort of money
dragon with two mouths, for whereas the man
who toils in the office has to be supplied simply
with a salary, the traveller has to get salary and
expenses. He has frequently to be a sort of
perambulating hard-drink fountain, and half his
time is wasted wasting other people's time. He
is generally a hard-working fellow who carries a
lot of responsibility and sees the city only during
his week-end rests. Occasionally he goes insolvent,
and then the public is enabled to see how the
commerce of small economies burns this particular
candle at both ends :
Insolvent said he had received £4 a week salary and 2£
per cent, commission. His average earnings were £lO a
week, but living and travelling expenses absorbed the
whole. “ Customers ”in his expenses account stood for
drinks, and sometimes afternoon tea.
L. Alexander, manager for P. Falk and Co., deposed
that the expenses account of insolvent was quite credible.
Accounts were passed by his firm for £4O to £5O for a
month’s trip, exclusive of railway fares. In some cases
the accounts included £l3 for “refreshments.” He al-
ways passed travellers’ refreshment accounts if they were
not more than 7/- a day, which was reasonable. It would
ruin a traveller’s business }f he was known in the country
as a “ mean man.”
Commerce puts a good deal of faith in the gospel of
force, and the man who can drag customers into the
fold by the ear is sure of a fair living and a liberal
refreshment allowance; but he has to be hard-
headed enough to see where his allowance leaves
off and his salary begins, otherwise he is financi-
ally lost. In the end the customer who succumbs
pays for all the refreshment he gets as well as the
refreshment absorbed by the man who didn’t
order. And he will have to go on paying until
the teetotal electric drummer is invented that will
rush up and down the land carrying two tons of
samples, and talk for a week for 9d. (P.S. —The
customer will supply the 9d.)
* * * *
A queer case, at Sydney Quarter Ses-
sions, was that of a ticket-scalper who appealed
to Judge Murray against a £5O fine levied upon
him for selling railway tickets in defiance of the
by-laws. The plea was that defendant was or
had been a reputed and well-known seller of
tickets. The railway people knew he sold them,
and he knew that they knew. Further he had
made it a practice of attending the Court pro-
ceedings in all ticket-scalping cases, so as to
know who were the men employed to catch the
scalpers. In the case appealed against, the man
to whom he was said to have sold the ticket was
a well-known agent of the railway people—so
well known that defendant, as a hardened and
skilful offender, couldn’t have been so idiotic as
to sell him a ticket. Judge Murray held that this
was a most reasonable theory, and quashed the
conviction. Further he said that defendant had
his full sympathy. The real man to blame was
Johnson, theßailway Commissioner, who persisted
in charging less than twice the single fare for all
double journeys. This was a distinct temptation
to the scalpers, who were only law breakers by an
absurd regulation. If it is Judge Murray’s
serious belief that a man should be excused for
breaking a law because it is an easy law to break,
there should be a good time ahead for some very
undesirable people.
* * * *
The other day the Mel bourne Board of
Works notified Premier Weary that it had been
for 11 years serving notices on the State Govern-
ment to get the city gaol sewered, and it proposed
to have him fined or caged in one of his own cells
if he didn’t now have it done promptly. Murray
is alleged to have been a trifle disturbed at the
notice, but he pulled himself together sufficiently
to remark that he would look into the question,
though as there was a proposal to shift the insti-
tution altogether the matter could not be rushed.
Certainly the prison ought to be shifted ; but as
there are still metropolitan State schools un-
sewered, and as there isno thought of shifting them,
Murray’s plea doesn’t look as genuine as it might.
Melbourne lately discovered something
new in cranks. She had flaming red hair, and
only one trick, but it was a good one. She would
call at a house and beg a glass of water; then,
whilst it was being de-
canted from the tap,
she would, if the door
! were left open, make
a bee line for a bed-
> room and turn in.
After that nothing
less forcible than a
policeman or large
cash remuneration
would shift her. It
was an embarrassing
position for the owners
of the beds, especially
if they happened to be
bachelors or grass wid-
owers: One establish-
ment where the tinted
Venus snatched a camp
sent for the police, but
when the representative
called on the female to come
out and put on her boots and
disperse herself, a languid voice
from the darkened boudoir re-
quested that less noise should be
made, and that she should be called
at seven. She might have pro-
ceeded to order that her meals
should be served in bed, but the
force got tired of waiting, and
shouted out threats of buckets of
cold water. So the red-haired
female arose and came out with her
corsets under her arm. She told
the policeman what she thought of
him, concealing nothing and say-
ing nearly everything. In
fact, she exhausted the sub-
— ject. Then she sat down on
the doorstep and put on her
boots, and after that, she faded up the street as
silently as she had faded down it an hour or so
earlier.
The Melbourne tramway grab has just
struck a new scheme that may save it a few more
thousand pounds. i The rails that were put down
in the boom days naturally don’t get any thicker
or better as time and the trams run on ; in fact,
a good many of the rails are already so worn on
the “flats,” where the wheels run, that the
“grooves” are wearing the flanges of the wheels.
As there are still seven years of the concession to
go, the co. was threatened with the expense of
renewing the rails over the whole system, till a
couple of smart Australians invented a “ rail-
planer,” which levels the flat sur-
face while deepening the groove.
So the co. is for the moment
in clover, as usual. This
machine, while leaving the rails
smooth and level, will naturally
make them no thicker; that is
to say, they may last another
eight or 10 years, and then,
when the municipalities take
the system over “in good order
and condition,” they will within
a year or two probably have
to face the expense of new
rails throughout. The company
cutely asked the Tramways
Trust —the municipal represen-
tatives—if there was any ob-
jection to the planer ; but the
Trust decided to .“take no
action,” so there is a proba-
bility of large trouble when the
lease expires in July, 1916.
“ Boh ” —her tale of woe :
I can’t often indulge in a morning walk ; the early
hours usually find me fiercely frying bacon for the family
breakfast. But the other morning I escaped, anil
wandered down the road that runs by the sea. The peace
of Sunday was over every thing—also the mud. A moth-
eaten and frayed dog and myself shared the landscape
between us. We also shared a stale biscuit that I dis-
covered in my coat pocket. I am not much on Nature
study—feeding fowls in the wet weather has choked me
off—but when I noticed a big crab lying on his back
kicking the air, I thought it only polite to turn him over
on his business side with mother’s best umbrella. You
would have thought that measty crab had been waiting
for me all night, tie simply rushed me and nipped a
hole in my stocking. It wasn’t a lonely bole I know, but
still—. Again I perambulated on, thinking beautiful
thoughts and forgetting the moth-eaten dog—and then a
cyclone struck me. As I gathered myself up a yelping
streak of canine disappeared round the corner. Attached to
his tail was my friend the stocking wrecker, and mother’s
umbrella had a village settlement of mud all over it.
There were a good many birds about, including- one that
always annoys me. He seems to whistle “ Where are you
wor-kingl” I believe his correct name is the brain-fever
bird or the devil-devil bird. Then there was the hearty
lunch bird, and the stomach-ache bird, and the flying
nightmare, and the barrel-organ bird, and the insomnia
bird. Also, the doves, with their incessant cry of “Rackety-
coo ! Rackety-coo! This way to the padded cell.” I was
brought up next door to an iron foundry. That was bad
enoug-h—they used to fire up about five, and awful
clangs and bumps and crashes would nearly shake the
mortgage off the roof. Then when they suddenly blew
off steam the top of your head also blew off ; but it was
better than doves. A little further on a man shot past
me. He was clad mostly in singlet and white shoes, and
he ran so fast that he only took 100 yd. to do a mile. I
thought it was an express lunatic, but when about 10
more ballet gentlemen rent the atmosphere I knew it
was the gentle harrier out training. I modestly faded
in the back way on my return, with my torn stocking on
my foot, mother’s boggy best umbrella in my hand, and a
pint of sea-sand from the harriers’feet in my eye. And
behind me came the cold-lunch bird and asked if I was
working. '
“ D.” muses :
The elephant that paces thepleasauncesof the Vaucluse
(Sydney) Zoo, when it eventuates, will do so in an atmo-
sphere of considerable romance. There are any number
of historical associations clinging to the piece of land
which the N.S.W. Government has just acquired. It is
nearly a century sinCe Sir John Brown-Hayes, Bart., look
up his residence there. He was transported for abduct-
ing an heiress. Sir John had been, in happier, freer days,
a Regency buck. (The Regent is said to have asked his
—Sir J.’s—sister, after the latter’s lamented departure,
why she never came to Court. “I will come,” rejoined
the young woman, acidly, “when my brother returns from
your Highness’s colony in Australia.”) He possessed all
the turbulence of the typical Mohawk. As a stirrer-up
of strife he was unsurpassed. At his best Macarthurand
Dr. Lang themselves would have been forced to yield
him pride of place. It is related that shortly after he
settled down in his Vaucluse home he was asked to a
men’s dinner at Government House. Some officers re-
fused to “ take wine ” with him, on the ground that he
was an emancipist. The slighted bart. passed over the
insult in the case of those whom he adjudged his equals
in rank ; the remainder he advanced upon and severally
dragged about the room by the nose. In one case he
made a practice of dragging the enemy by 7 the pro-
boscis whenever he encountered him in public until
the assaulted one’s life became a misery 7. Brown-
Hayes was reputed a dangerous swordsman. There
seems no doubt that he imported a ship-load of Irish soil,
and bestowed the same round his mansion. Irish folk
aver that the grass is greener immediately about Vaucluse
as a consequence ; also that no one has ever seen a snake
near the old house.
Later, W. C. Wentworth bought the place. It then
became a meeting-place for the leading politicians and
litterateurs of the day. Maeleay 7 , Stuart, Robertson,
Martin, Dailey and others regularly foregathered there.
In “The Hut” on the little beach near by the original
“Cabbage Tree Mob ” met on Sundays, and betimes on
week days, and ate heavily and drank deep, and pulled
each others’ legs bard and often, as was the sprightly
habit of their time and class.
The animals which are doomed to spend their existences
at Vaucluse may take comfort in the reflection that there
is hardly any well-known Australian, or a single dis-
tinguished visitor to N.S.W.’s anguished old State, but has
revelled on the site of their home. The view from it
down the harbor is as fair as the most exigent lion or
cobra or wtiat not might desire.
“San Remo”: Australia, with its “no
encumbrance ” advertisements, might do well to
emulate the latest move of France, where the in-
frequent arrival of young Pierre and Alphonse is
recognised as a very real national danger. A Bill
has been placed on the table of the Chamber of
Deputies making it a punishable offence for a
landlord to refuse to accept tenants, or to expel
tenants, beoause of their having children. That
is a beginning, but there should also be a law im-
posing a minimum fine of £lOO on the paper which
publishes the advt. that says “ no encumbrance,”
and a similar fine for the employer who gives a
preference to the unmarried and the childless—the
fact that there is a remarkable preponderance of
the unmarried and the childless among his em-
ployees to be regarded as sufficient evidence.

Chief Justice Madden, shocked at the alleged growth
of immorality among young girls in Melbourne, suggests
the restoration of the curfew-bell, to ring in the young at
sundown. He thinks all girls under 17 should be tolled
off the grass, the beaches and the streets at 8 o’clock in
summer, and earlier in winter. —Daily paper.
She was a plump and pleasing miss ; T
She had a dark and roving eye, )
Seemed old enough to squeeze and kiss, [/
And roguish rather, if not sly.
He took her for a stroll, to be
Beside the grandeur of the sea.
It was a dreamy summer eve.
Her skirts were just a trifle short.
He ’gan his loving tale to weave—
A story of the olden sort;
But as he talked a bell at hand
Tolled sullenly across the sand.
The damsel turned and ran away.
Her fear was terrible to see.
He followed, calling her to stay.
“No, no ! ” she said. “ It must not be.
For, the whole bitter truth to tell,
I am, alas! a curfew-belle!”

against haphazard marriage. “People nowadays are
careful in breeding horses and dogs, and even cats, but
no attention is paid to the breeding of healthy Then and

they can get before the registrar."
Once in the spring, when-Wilty’s mind
Was turned in love’s direction,
He looked with favor on his kind,
And trusted with an instinct blind
To sexual selection.
But we’re progressive nowaday,
Our blood is more pacific,
We leave behind the olden way,
And courtship in 2000 may
Be wholly scientific.
The future bachelor, we know
Will Mary’s rosy lip shun.
When seeking for a wife, he’ll go
To find a doctor, tell him so,
And ask for a prescription !

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Though the directors had power to go ahead on
their own responsibility, the shareholders in the A.J.S.
Bank were called together last week and the plan of
reconstruction was put before them ; and though share-
holders are to lose all the capital they have paid up and
half of the £2 10s. per share which they are now to pay,
there were only three opponents of the scheme submitted.
These three, led by W. J. Miles, a well-known accountant,
evidently stumble over the proposal that a “sinking fund ”
shall be provided “ either out of profits or corpus or both ”
to slowly wipe out that part of the old deposits which
is to be represented by inscribed stock. The term “sinking
fund ” is unfortunate, since the fund may be provided out
of corpus—which practically means out of other borrow-
ings. But the idea is clear enough. The new bank—the
Australian Bank of Commerce—has already been regis-
tered ; and the work of completing the transfer is now
in progress.
* * m m
The Australian Alliance Assurance Co., which
for years past has been suffering from dry rot, has made
up its mind to sell itself bodily to a big English concern,
the London and Lancashire. The idea has been simmer-
ing for a long while ; and the directors have been moving
around and getting support for their bad idea. There
are only 50,000 shares altogether, and as 30,000 of these
are in the bag, the Alliance directors guarantee the
transfer of that number to the English co., which will
.phus entirely control the situation. That would be bad
.enough; a worse feature is that, though from this
out the Alliance is to be a foreign concern,
owned wholly or mainly by a foreign co., and
to all intents and purposes a branch of a foreign busi-
ness, it is evidently to be run under its present name
“ The existing organisation is to be continued, with the
present Board of Directors.” There is one such case
already in existence ; and what happens is shown by the
fact that an intensely Australian co., which has its agency
in a big N.S. W. town, calls upon its clients to do business
with that particular insurance office because it is Aus-
tralian. Apparently the same thing will happen in this
case—the London and Lancashire, besides getting the
business it has had hitherto, will also keep up the old
Australian Alliance sign at separate offices, and will thus
also get business from people who believe in patronising
Australian concerns. It is about time that that sort of thing
was stopped. If people ivill trade with foreign concerns,
knowing them to be foreign, well and good ; but foreign
concerns ought anyhow to be prevented from trading in
such a manner as to obtain business from those who
might reasonably believe that they were supporting
Australian concerns.

In its struggle to make things look a little more present-
able, the co. has done some window-dressing, and has
written up its freehold to the extent of £4050. This free-
hold previously stood in the books at £13,250 ; so almost
one-third has been tacked on to its book value. Possibly
the premises are worth more than they were when the
co. bought them a few years ago; yet this writing up is
in general a very dangerous and a very doubtful card to
play. Besides the funds shown above the co. has a
shareholders’ paid Capital of £12,500; the shares are
fully paid. That capital is an advantage, no doubt,
from one point of view ; but it has its drawbacks!
chief among them being that it carries a 10 per cent!
cumulative preferent dividend, chargeable on the Indus-
irial profits. This is, however, less of a disadvantage
than it looks, because, except in rare cases, the Indus-
trial policy in other offices is not entitled to any profits
at all. Besides the £12,500 of paid capital, and the
amount by which the premises have been written up, the
co. claims also another asset—“ New business extension
account, £5500.” In the foregoing table this has, of
course, been disregarded. It simply means that the co.
has spent £5500 in agents’ salaries, etc. ; bub instead of
treating that money as spent and done with, it treats it
as an asset; though it is represented by nothing that even
the most experienced auditor could feel, taste, or smell.
The year’s figures are clearly bad, especially in
the Industrial department, where £B7OB more has been
paid out than has been got in. Some sympathy can,
however, be very well offered to the present management
on that score. In the very early days of the co. it did a
good deal of short-term endowment business—business
which an insurance office has no right to touch. The
object was clear enough: this cheap and niisty sort of
policy inflated the figures, and made the co. look as
though it were going ahead at a great rate. Now
the chickens are coming home to roost; the policies are
falling due, and to its credit the co. isn’t now pushing this
class of. mock-insurance business in order to swell the
premiums and so counterbalance the heavy payments.
The do. is therefore now suffering really for its early sins.
And the sins of to-day are quite as much as most of us
can comfortably manage—this office included.
Expenses are abnormally high in both depart-
ments :
Expenses in Proportion to Total Income.
Industrial. Ordinary.

Both income and expenditure are swollen by what looks
like very curious finance for an insurance office. In the
Industrial branch the Government securities are
valued at £14,657. Yet on the other side we
have —“ Bank of N. S. Wales £10,446.” In other
words, while income is swollen by interest from the
holding of gilt-edged securities, a no doubt much higher
rate of interest is being paid on a heavy overdraft. Pos-
sibly the co. is under some obligation to keep its capital
in Government securities ; if not, it. looks as though the
co. is throwing away a good deal of money. The expense
rate in the Ordinary branch has shrunk a good deal dur-
ing the year. It would be really a pleasant change if we
could leave it at that —it would be one cheerful feature
about the accounts, anyway. But the truth which must
be told is that, whereas in 1907-8 the co. wrote 2079
policies assuring £307,042, in 1908-9 it wrote oply 1092
policies assuring £143,350; and that falling-off in new
business makes all the difference. This paper’s usual
plan for estimating- the cost of new business is to charge
old or renewal business with 7 per cent, of the premiums,
and throw the rest on to the new business; but allowing
10 per cent, in this office because it is only a little one,
then the new business has cost no less than 250£ per cent,
of the new-business premiums, as against 181 per cent, in
the previous year. Nothing can be more certain than
that an office cannot afford the expense rate which this
office has hitherto shown ; and if the reserves continue to
be good enough (an actuarial investigation is now in pro-
gress) it can only be through a heavy lapse and surrender
rate after the first two or three years. One thing policy-
holders, especially in the Ordinary branch, may view with
satisfaction—four-fifths of the insurance-fund is repre-
sented by Government securities. How the co. may
shape in the future this paper doesn’t know. The way of
the young insurance office, especially in a field already
so well covered as Australia, is inevitably hard ; and for
a while it is practically impossible for it to show results
to compare with those of other offices. Those therefore
who go into it must take some risks. Like the infant
who is dropped into uncongenial surroundings, it may
pull through and grow into vigorous and profitable man-
hood ; or it may fall out by the way.

This co. was formed in 1905 to take over the business of
the Brisbane Electric Supply 00. ; but accounts for the
first few terms are not available. The purchase price was
£35,257 exclusive of plant, mains, etc. ; this was presum-
ably for ,the goodwill, and it still figures in the balance-
sheet as “ Purchase account.” On the other side, how-
ever, a reserve is being built up, at the rate of £lOOO a
year, to wipe out the purchase account bv the year
1940, when the co.’s orders-in-council, under which
it operates, will expire..* At the same time, a renewal,
replacement and contingencies reserve is being provided.
At present it amounts to £20,046, £8404 having been
added during the past 12 months. As mains, plant, etc.,
stand at only about £49,000, this allowance for deprecia-
tion appears to be extremely liberal. In considering the
profits and the reserves mentioned above, it has to be
remembered that this renewal and replacement fund
is included with the reserves; also, of course,
additions to the fund are reckoned in with the
profits. If the depreciation amounts to as much
as the sums that have been added to this
fund, then the profits for last half-year were only £3318,
and for the previous half-year £4OBl. It is hard, though,
to believe that mains, plant, etc., ought to be written down
20 per cent, a year, unless they were badly over-valued
when the co. took them over ; yet that is what the fore-
going would amount to. The financial position has
changed as follows during the past 12 months: —
1908. 1909.
Stock and liquid assets .. £11,607 £17,829
Liabilities .. .. .. 3,654 4,77 S
Surplus £7,953 £13,051
Meantime, the paid capital has been increased from
£73,292 to £80,211. Practically, therefore, the capital
got in during the year is represented by liquid assets,
while the extensions of plant and mains, amounting to
£7356, as well as additions to motors, etc., on hire, have
been paid for out of surplus revenue. Depreciation is an
uncertain quantity ; but, making a very liberal allowance
for that, it looks as though the co. were doing very well
indeed. From the half-yearly statement of units sold
this comparison is built up:—
July, 1907 .. £627,570 Jan., 1909 .. £976,789
Jan., 1908 .. 853,920 July, 1909 .. 1,035,429
July, 1908 .. 960,715
Which is very remarkable progress. From the investor’s
point of view, one thing that has to be kept in mind is
that the co.’s Orders-in-Council run out in 1940 ; so that
rhings are liable to come,to a dead stop then, though if
things go all right and the “franchise and purchase
sinking fund account” keeps growing, it is at least
possible that there may be a return of part of the capital
before that distant year heaves in sight. Of the shares,
20,000 are preference.

This isn’t a satisfactory concern to condense into a table
like the foregoing ; yet after recasting the whole business,
and reviewing the result standing up and sitting down,
The Bulletin came back in despair to the old rickety
table in use at previous post-mortems. The figures show
the position at the end of each term. The trouble
is that, under the society’s arrangement with its
creditors, the old debenture and deposit holders now get 3
per cent, as a general thing, but if the surplus earnings
in one year will run to it they get an extra 2 per cent., paid
during the next year. This year, however, the full 5 per
cent, has already been paid for one half-year ; therefore
in the foregoing table the extra 2 per cent, for three
half-years has been charged against the year’s revenue,
and that makes the year’s trading result look
worse than it really was. The position is also compli-
cated by the fact that, though the society balances in
July, the interest on deposits and debentures is made up
to May and November. The chief business of the concern
ever since the boom burst has, however, been to get rid of
properties and pay off debt with the proceeds rather
than to struggle after a trading profit; and in connection
with this chief business the following progress has been
made since 1896 :
1896. 1908. 1909.
Australian deposits, etc. £169,416 £42,541 £32,180
British ditto .. .. 307,659 100,709 78,136
Mortgages, etc 30,000 Nil Nil
Total debt .. £507,105 £143,250 £110,316
So during- the past year £32,934 has been paid off, or
£396,789 in 13 years ; and to do that the assets (book
value) have been reduced in this fashion :
1896. 1908. 1909.
Advances £660,083 £212,559 £178,915
Premises 78,000 78,000 78,000
Other assets .. .. 1,125 23,950 21,146
In 13 years £396,789 of debt has thus been paid off, and
£20,021 has been added to the liquid assets; total,
£416,810. To do this £481,168 of “ advances ” have been
got rid of. Deducting the “ other assets” from the re-
maining debt, there is £90,295 to pay off ; and there are
£178,915 of “advances” and £78,000 of premises to pay
it with. But these latter are book-values ; the question
is—YVhat are these assets worth ? The advances are
made up as follows: Advances and purchasers’ balances
under full repayments, £126,499 ; ditto at reduced pay-
ments, £5610 ; house property, £25,171 ; vacant land,
£21,635. The balances “under full repayment”
ought to be worth 20s, in the £ ; whether they
will turn out like that depends, no doubt, on the
property market during the next year or two. If
these assets are worth 20s. in the £ the interest return
looks very small: on the average of the “ full repay-
ment” loans, and disregarding- the others altogether, the
total interest received during the year only amounted to
4 per cent. Still, taking the advances of all kinds
(£132,109) as sufficient to pay off the total debt, there
would still remain to the shareholders the house and
land property, the extravagant premises, and the “other
assets” mentioned above. It seems highly probable
therefore that the shareholders will escape from the
wreck with something considerably more than the skin
of their teeth, though as the advances are only earning
4 percent, while the old depositors, etc., are now getting-
-5 per cent., the shareholders can’t expect much if any-
thing in the way of dividends. The paid capital at pre-
sent is nominally £193,210 ; and the time seems to have
about arrived for the society to throw away its weeds,
and write down its assets on one side and its capital on
the other, and tell the world that it is ready for ordinary
business again.

In addition to the usual interest credited to share-
holders, the society declares for the past year a bonus of
ss. per share, payable on the maturity of the shares.
The position has very considerably improved during the
past few years. Rock-bottom was reached in 1906, when
the capital got down below £12,000. With the improve-
ment in wool values, the slight increase in closer settle-
ment in Tasmania, and the recent activity in mining,
things have looked up in Launceston. The following com-
parison shows how the various items have moved :
1900. 1905. 1908. 1909.
Share capital .. £20,871 £17,323 £15,613 £16,125

Premises .. .. Nil Nil 4,000 4,000
Cash, etc 718 1,469 1,634 105
Apparently there are no foreclosed properties on hand ;
whether there will be in the future depends upon the
sort of management the society is having during the re-
cent and present run of generally hig.h values. The
position from the deppsitors’ point of view is unusually
strong; for capital and reserves almost equal deposits.
There would have to be a tremendous shrinkage in
values, therefore, before the depositors’ money would be
in any danger at all. On account of the size of the re-
serves, shareholders also have much more protection
than in most building societies, though, of course, they
would have proportionately less than they have now if
the capital were to suddenly increase.

The £55 shown above as written off in the first year went
apparently in preliminary expenses ; the £57 written off
in the second year came off the contingency fund with
which the society started. The wisdom of showing this
surplus as a reserve at all was doubtful; it is more doubt-
ful policy still to leave off calling it a contingency fund
and show it as a reserve fund, which was done subse-
quently. Very good progress has been made by the
society, whose chief figures have moved along as follows :
1906. 1907. 1908. 1909.

Other assets .. .. 322 189 143 196
Considering the rapid increase of the risks—represented
by advances—the growth of reserves has been slow ; it
would have been much more prudent to have put
the dividend up in a more leisurely; way, and thus
have allowed for a greater, lay-by. Apart from the so-
called reserve with which the society started, only £1492
has been accumulated. This means that, as the risks have
been increased by £24,679, only Is. 2d. in the £ has been
laid aside (and that not in cash) to meet any possible de-
preciation of values. And,in view of thefactthat the past
four years have been years of prosperity and high prices,
depreciation is considerably more than possible. Alto-
gether, in spite of the excellent increase of business, which
ought to have made it easier for the society to have
adopted the opposite policy, the accounts give the im-
pression that the management is too eager to show’big
profits and pay big dividends. Small items like “Furni-
ture and account bocks, £144,” deepen that impression ;
surely it isn’t too much to ask the society, especially in
such good times as these, to pay for its account books as
it buys them, and charge the cost up to working expenses
instead of carrying them into the balance-sheet as an
asset to be written off out of future' profits. Depositors
are, however, not much concerned about these things.
For the present they are very fully covered ; and for the
future they get unusual protection from the society’s rule
which says that deposits, etc., may not be taken in excess
of twice the amount of the paid capital.

This co. W’as formed just 50 years ago, its object being to
make money out of life insurance in the usual Private
Enterprise manner. some years later, however, insurers
found a much better way of getting what they wanted,
so this co. went out of active business, and is now merely
waiting: for the last policy to mature ; meantime it 1
comforting: itself with 25 per cent. divs. Its assurance
fund is £155,916; so, presuming that that is tuu
cover for its obligations, and presuming also tnat
its assets are worth 20s. in the £, it has its capital
(£40,000) intact and £33,243 besides. Its assets include
£94,694 of mortgages; the balance is nearly an
cash deposits or public securities. The dividends
are very big; but in one respect the concern is very like a
mine—every year it gets nearer its end. Further, as the
shrinkage of the reserves shows, the dividends are
days being to a great extent paid out of the profits of the
past.

This co. has an authorised capital of £300,000, but only
£25,000 has been issued, and the shares are fully paid.
As the property stands in the books at £150,000 and the
plant at another £13,000, a heavy mortgage has to be
carried. The amount used to be £125,000; and for a
long while the mortgagees —English people, it is under-
stood —wouldn't accept repayments ; but during the last
few years various instalments have been paid off, and the
total is now £107,000, while the mortgage redemption
fund is still in credit £5OOO. This fund, however, isn’t at
present represented wholly by cash, heavy expense having
lately been incurred in special repairs and renewals to
increase the comfort of the lords and other people who
inhabit the hotel, and inspect Australia from the roof-
garden. With such a heavy debt the profits, after
paying interest, are bound to show great variations
according to whether the seasons are good or bad,
and visitors to the city affluent or otherwise ;
still with the gradual reduction of the debt and the
interest bill, the general trend of profits ought to be
steadily upwards. Yet, in order to keep the hotel where
it is in fashionable favor, there will no doubt have to be
a continual expenditure in buying the latest effects ; and
that will keep the dividends from climbing high enough
to get dizzy.

This co. runs an electric light as well as a gas business,
but apparently doesn’t run the electric lighting business
very hard. Probably on that account it isn’t a big busi-
ness ; last half-year it gave a profit of £ll4 on a total
investment of £14,740, though that was after writing off
£1262 for “ repairs, renewals and depreciation of plant,
including maintenance of lamps.” For years past large
amounts have been written off profits in this way,
and it is rather remarkable that the book value
of the plant, etc., in this branch hasn’t been thereby
got down lower than it is. Until 12 months ago,
however, the accounts were very badly presented ;
but from this onward it ought to be possible to
tell exactly how each of the two branches is doing.
Taking the business as a whole, the liabilities on June 30
totalled £3793 ; on the other side there were sundry
debtors, £10,483. These were the only liquid assets apart
from stoies, which are only more or less liquid. The co.
has been buying more electric lighting plant lately, and
it looks as though it proposes to stir up that branch in a
moderate way.

This shows a remarkably solid position. In eight years
£5218 has been added to the cash, etc., after paying for
renewals and extensions ; and the 15 per cent. div. has
been maintained. The co. has an authorised capital of
£50,000, of which only £lO,OOO has been issued ; and, as
the directors will hardly venture on a bigger div. than 15
per cent., it is becoming a question which lot is to have a
cut—the shareholders, in the shape of a few more shares,
or the consumers, in the shape of a reduction in the price
of gas. There is no justification for getting in more
capital; and the issue of bonus shares would be only a
furtive way of increasing the div. And for the supply of
such a public necessity as gas, surely 15 percent, is as
much as any co. should draw. The consumers therefore
ought to benefit. The co. already has cash and liquid
assets in hand practically equal to the amount of the
capital, and there seems to be no good reason wiry the
co. should go on piling up these funds still higher at the
expense of the public.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over a
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under eqiial conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23, per cent, less than
with the best soiid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be

The Callow .Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for a.ll
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with .v.astly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
fine wet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to be screened.
The machine is fully protected by patent rights, ior

Co., of Hanna Street, South Melbourne. This firm are the

sidered, however, the movement is not great, and doesn t
suggest that any too much is being put bj r . To extend
the business, the capital, now £ll,OOO, is to be increased
to £12,000. Tamworth has large possibilities; but at
present dividends tread very close on the heels of true
profits, if sometimes they don’t even get ahead of them.
The Sulphide Corporation’s Central mine,
Broken Hill, is calculated to be at present making a
profit of 21s. per ton of crude ore. It has arrived at this
prosperous condition largely owing to the success of its
tailings treatment. Its zinc flotation plant is the simplest
and most successful now’ in operation in Broken Hill. The
mine, too, is looking well, for the eastern ore body at the
UOOft. level is developing on the same massive lines as
the western body. This eastern ore body has not pie-
viouslv shown its hand in the upper levels, but may do so
vet. A small eastern vein certainly has been worked nearer
the surface, but there is nothing in its appearance to
suggest relationship with the fine body at the 1100 ft.
Soon the Central will have its own sulphuric acid plant,
and a little more should then be added to the profits.
The one doubt about the mine is whether the old creeps
have come to an end ; if they have, there is every appear-
ance of tile co. now making up to its shareholders for the
time that has been lost hitherto. Apart from the mine
the chief risk is in connection with the spelter (zinc)
market, which has played some curious tricks in past
days.
One section of the North 'Broken Hill’s new
4000-ton mill has had a trial run, and is believed to have
given greht satisfaction. There is a beautiful ore body in
r,he mine, and it runs right through into the Victoria
Cross property next door, which the North acquired on
easy terms. With such a sweet milling ore as the North
possesses, good returns may be looked for from the new
mill when Manager Weir gets it into full swing. But, as
pointed out before, the proved ore reserves are compara-
tively small compared with the mill’s capacity, though
things no doubt look well underfoot at the bottom level.
Broken Hill South Blocks is pegging away
steadily at the sinking of its main shaft, and at the same
time is doing a little prospecting on the western side of
the present bottom level. At the south end, this level
has opened up much better than was expected ; for the
southern pitch of the shoot has given a greater length of
ore than was found on the level above. The inference is
that, with this southerly pitch, the ore will extend
further south at each successive level. It looks
as though a strong western ore body will be
found at 1000 ft. or 1100 ft., as a west crosscut
put out from the hanging wall on the bottom
level (526 ft.) shows that the veins of sulphides passed
through on that side in the upper levels are becoming
stronger and more numerous. The existence of this lode
is indicated by a strong outcrop on the surface ; and this
may also be the formation which has been cut further on
in the South Extended. #
The Murex magnetic separator, which
boomed on the London share market and then had a bad
slump, draws rather heavily on the imagination. The
novelty is a “magnetic fluid ” that is mixed with the
mineral. Induced magnetism is supposed to cause the
metalliferous particles to “jump towards the magnet like
a reversed shower of rain.” This reads like a bit out of
Wells or some other fanciful yarn-spinner; but the
patentee may think it wise to withhold more definite
particulars about a “ magnetic fluid,” since he might set
all the world improving on his idea. The process is to be
tested at Block 14, Broken Hill.
“Jack” Roberts, who for years has stuck to
Brown’s Oreek mine, near Blayney, and has lately had it
on tribute, has fixed up a co., of which himself, Q. H.
Kerry and “ Bellambi ” Waley are directors, ; to work it
afresh. A French co. spent a heap of money on the puggy
ore of this mine, but was beaten by the loss of gold in the
slimes. For one thing, the stamps were no doubt too
heavy. The new co. is going to depend largely on
direct cyanidation, though there is some harder ore
which will go to the battery, while some of the stuff—pure
slime—will be first passed through filter presses. Partly
on account of the extent of the curious deposit Brown’s
Creek is a fascinating proposition, and if the treatment
troubles can be beaten, a heap of gold ought to come out
of the mine. How much of it will stick to the new co.
depends mainl3 r on costs ; and on that point nothing very
definite can be said until the machinery gets to work,
and passes the first experimental stages.
It is nine years since dredging was started in a
practical way in N. S. Wales, and during that time
£1,040,886 worth of gold and £1,573,195 worth of tin have
been either pumped or scooped up. For gold the bucket-
dredge is most favored ; at the end of 1908 there were 21
of them as against five of the pump type. In working
the rougher tin country, however, the pump is favorite :
there are 28 of that type as against three bucket-dredges.
The bucket gold-dredges last year won an average of
4-94 d. per cubic yard treated; the pump-dredges
6'73d. In tin the buckets averaged 4'49d. (a shade
over Jib. to the vard); the pumps 11’65d. (a
shade under IJlb. to the yard). Araluen provides
more of the gold than any other districtthe
Jeiubaicumbene, ditto Middle, ditto Central, Erlington,
Bellevue, Araluen Valley; Redbank, Araluen Central and
other small cos. and private owners are at work here.
The Stuart Town dredges are next in importance (Asso-
ciated, Macquarie, etc.). In tin, Cope’s Creek is the chief
centre ; there are 10 plants working along this stream,
and 13 more in other parts of the Tingha district. The
13 include the Melbourne Cope’s Creek two plants, which
work in Herding Yard Gully and a small gully near by.
No. 1 plant of this co. has for some time past been the
biggest producer in the State. There are many patches
of rich ground in this and the neighboring Emmaville
district ; but the water-supply is precarious, though
lately the trouble has been, not too little, but too much
water.
* * * *
The yarn was printed in Sydney last week, and
it is probably quite true, that a new smelting co. has been
formed to undertake the smeltingof Kangiara and Kootra
ores. These are two shows off the Southern line in N. S.
Wales ; and, though there is nothing whatever to suggest
that they could-keep a decent-sized smelting plant going,
they have nevertheless been boomed extravagantly. Most
of the ore at both mines is complex, and much of it is too
poor to pay working expenses even if it occurred in big
bodies, which it doesn’t. The last report of Kangiara, for
instance, contained things like this: “No. 3 north
winze.—Milling ore full width. Values: Silver, soz.
4dwt. 13gr.; gold, trace; copper, trace; lead, 3'25 per
cent.” That ore, then, was worth soz. silver and 3J per
cent. lead. There is far better stuff than that on the
Broken Hill mullock dumps. Take one of the smaller
Broken Hill mines, the Junction. In the half-year to
March, 1907, when metal values were much higher than
they are now, that co. made a loss of £/35 ; and yet: the
15,735 tons of ore which it treated averaged: Silver,
9'20z.; lead, 12'3 per cent. Ore assaying soz. silver 3J per
cent, lead is worth, say, ISs. gross ; and even the Broken
Hill South, working a very big body under specially
favorable circumstances, found in a recent half-year
that its working costs were 20s. s|d. per ton—-
that was for mining and milling only. Other portions of
the Kangiara mine consist of comparatively small bodies
of mixed copper and lead, both of low grade. The copper
and lead assays as published look good ; but in such cases
the copper can be knocked out altogether it is simply in
the way. At Kootra the ore is even more complex. The
most misleading plan is adopted of reporting that “ the
value of the metals contained in the stone” from this
mine is £2O or whatever it may be per ton. The
presence of some of these metals doesn t add
to the value of the ore at all —it detracts from it,
because they make it more difficult to extract
any of the contents at all. The Mungana (N.Q.) is a case
in point. During the last seven years it has sent out
159 314 tons of ore of an average value of 4.17p.c. copper,
14 8p c. lead, and ll.loz. silver, and it hasn’t been able
to" pay a single dividend. If it had had the silver
and the copper alone, or the silver and the lead
alone, it would have paid handsomely during the
metal boom ; but in spite of its big bodies it has not been
able to make any headway because the three metals are
in the one lump. * » *
Golden Pole (W.A.) still lias a breath or two
left, but that seems about all. The manager’s half-yearly
report to July 31 shows that tributors’ ore realised 29130 z.
and old tailings 7750 z. ; total, 36880 z., valued at £15,665.
Ore reserves are “off,” the report stating that it is im-
possible to give any estimate, as the tributors have taken
out the stone as fast as it has been developed, and the
short, narrow vein of 27dwt. stuff, whose appearance in
the bottom workings recently kicked the shares up over
100 per cent., is showing in the level only.
* * * *
On June 30 the Lake View reserves were esti-
mated at 172,050 tons, assaying 28s. 2d. per ton, or about
4s. more than the present mill average. Compared with
the estimate for the previous half-year, the figures show
a drop of 2000 tons in quantity, and an increase of Is. per
ton in value.

8., M. and Co. still hustle hard for options in
the West on behalf of their various cos. Recent addi-
tions to their list are Fraser’s mine at Southern Cross and
a group of shows in the Youanmee district. The firm's
chief ruler in the Commonwealth, W. J. Loring, returns
from London early in November,
When the Paringa (W.A.) closed its half-year
in May it had £.1403 in cash and some securities estimated
to be worth £9227. The property, which wouldn’t bring
more than a few hundreds by auction, stands in the books
at £144,198; the machinery and buildings, which could
scarcely be sold for old iron and firewood, are down at
£3997 and “ mine development,” which is represented
by water-logged workings and probably caved-in stopes,
is submitted as an asset worth £21,848. In view of these
things it is possible that the other securities want check-
ing. * The Board asks shareholders to believe that the
mine will be worth a bit some day, but in the meantime
it urges them to subscribe additional capital to purchase
a substantial share interest in the New Axim in West
Africa. From all one can hear, however, this show isn t
of much account; so that shareholders will demand some
independent testimony unless they want to get out of the
oven into the furnace.

London papers are busy explaining that there
never was more than a suggestion to amalgamate the
Hannan’s Star Deep Levels, Main Reef and Chaffers on
the basis cabled from London ; also that, in view of the
violent antagonism of certain Australian interests, the
originators of the scheme decided to abandon it. Rub-
bish ! As already remarked, there rarely are formal
negotiations in cases of this sort. The controllers
unofficially fix ,up things before anyone else gets the
“ office,” and then the general body of shareholders have
either to like it or lump it. In this instance, however,
the cat seems to have scratched its way out of the bag too
soon, and so spoiled the deal.

Gwalia South (W.A.) seems to have galloping
consumption. Last January the reserves were given as
—“ Actual,” 30,410 tons, worth 625. 6d. ; and ‘ probable,
4000 tons, worth 58s. 6d. per ton. During the next six
months, 11,599 tons, yielding £28,523 (approximately 495.
per ton), were extracted ; and at the end of that time the
ore in sight,was alleged to be about 11,350 tons, assaying
425. 2d. Allowing for the tonnage taken out, and reckon-
ing the ore developed meantime as nil, this showed a drop
of' 5461 tons, to say nothing ot the big discrepancy be-
tween the estimated worth of the ore exposed in January
and the actual value of that treated in the next six
months. By this time, speculators’ faith in some
of the Westralian yarns about what is in the cupboard
must be very weak. m , *
News comes from London via the West that the

Shallcross and others have succeeded in forming
the Gold Industry of W.A., Ltd., to acquire and work
likely mining ventures. The co., which is registered in
London, has a paid-up capital of £35,000, and the share-
holders include Moreing, Loring, the two Horns, Clark,
W. T. Jones, and a number of Berth and Kalgoorlie min-
ing men.
The mostly-Sydney people who guessed right
about the Sa'ndstone (W.A.) are making the same
sort of guess about the underlay blocks of the Black
Range, and have formed a co. called the Black
Range West. Its object is to put down a shaft
in the expectation of catching the lode at about
300 ft. Manager Whitfeld, of the Sandstone, who reports
on the venture, doesn’t expect that they will get the
shoot of gold now worked by the Black Range; but he
regards it as geologically certain that they will get the
reef, and where the reef is there another shoot or two of
gold are quite likely to be.
* * •* *
London directors of some Westralian mining
cos. are being called to account for not telling share-
holders more about their investments. In one case—-that
of Hannans Star—some of the surplus cash has been
put into what has always been described as “ Investments
at Cost ”; but someone has caused a stir by unearthing
what appears to be the fact that some of this item
represents money sunk in an unprofitable Raveristhoipe
pub. In view of this discovery, probably shareholders
will want some guarantee that other items, such as
“Sundry debtors, etc.,” does not conceal speculations
in the bottle-o business.
Charters Towers is still gambling on expected
mine developments, though in a rather languid vvay at
> went. Brilliant Block is opening up a formation at
it.-47ft. which is the deepest of seven formations cut in
tiie shaft. Brilliant Deep is sinking on a big mineralised
icef of uncertain quality. Enthusiastic followers of this
stock are disappointed at the last crushing of 340 tons
for an average of £4 18s. 3d., for the trial lot of 98 tons at
the beginning of the year was nearly twice as rich.
Brilliant Extended has got only, light mineral stone at
the bottom of the underlay Shaft, but the opening of No.
19 may give more encouragement. The last crushing of
4860 tons gave a profit of £2227, or about 9s. per ton.
This is considered satisfactory ; but as a business proposi-
tion the Extended—which has 250,000 shares—requires a
huge tonnage if it can show nothing better than a profit
of 9s per ton. With reserves counted at 70,000 tons, 9s.
per ton profit doesn’t justify the present market value of
about 9s. Mills’ United continues to produce from
£lO 000 to £12,000 per month, and while this can be main-
tain’ed things will be fairly cheerful. A sixpenny dividend
has been declared i this is less than usual, but the reduc-
tion has been expected for some time.

Enthusiastic North Queensland prospector Jack
Munro who introduced the Mitchell River gold and
antimony show to the public, and induced the Glasgow
Macarthur people to take a big* interest in it and put up
a plant to test their new gold-antimony process on it, is
superintending the resurrection of the venture. . The
Macarthurs’ last manager abandoned the whole thing
just when the plant was about to start; and Munro is
bucking in hard to prove that he was right about the
claim and the metallurgist all wrong. The never-used
plant has been overhauled, and the wheels snould go

Chillagoe (Q.) has taken to prospecting rather
late in life, and if the co. goes on with the development
of half a dozen widely-separated shows and completes
even half of its options, it will need a long purse. Still,
as a railway and smelter owner its right policy is unques-
tionably to promote prospecting and the resurrection of
old fields if it can’t find new ones. 'The “B}gßeef,”at
the head of the Etheridge line, paid well enough years
ago, and so did the Boomerang, 35 miles away on the
Percy River ; but it will take a lot of money to equip
these mines with machinery and develop them below
water level. Besides these it has in hand the Daintree,
on the Einasleigh river, and the Teesdale, on the railway
—both copper shows. And then it has work to do at
home ; for the sinking of the new Zillmanton shaft on its
own lease is probably just as important as any of the new
undertakings.

Gympie (Q.) has been looking expectantly
down Luck’s Lane for a long time now, and is beginning
to wonder seriously if the cobbled old thoroughfare will
ever take a turn. The hopes of the Two-Mile have been
damped through the failure of the Great Northern to
get onto something permanent enough to pay steady
divs. The co. is now reconstructing, having called upits
2s. 6d. per share capital; and its only chance seems to be
to go north and east. The Columbia line is still a
doubtful proposition. At the southern end of the “bid
East Oriental is working away on its big formation with
fair results. Last eight weeks’ output was 3743 tons for
21660 z., or an average of ll's7dwt. ; the distribution was
only 4d. per share, as the new boiler, drills, etc., took a
bite out of the proceeds. Scottish-Gympie’s month s
return was 17980 z. from 7200 tons (average, a point under
sdwt.). No. 1 North Oriental has just reported a little
gold in its big formation going north from the dip the
first note of promise in its long search for the East’s make
of crushing stuff. The Monkland deep-sinking proposal
—for whicn a Government subsidy was promised is hung
up for the time being through the political disturbance ;
and altogether things are not jolly.
* * * *
The New Einasleigh, which should be called
the old Daintree, of North Queensland, is beginning to
poke its name into the share lists. A London
co., originally promoted by W. H. Woodhead, of the
British Broken Hill, opened this property after it had
been resting for nearly half a century. Woodhead took
the thing in hand personally before Chillagoehad finished
its railway, and when those parts were fairly wild.
Now the parts are tame, but the people who went
into them are wild. During Woodhead’s regime the
Einasleigh was opened up with remarkable expedi-
tion, considering the conditions, and what promised to
be a very big silicious copper ore body was revealed.
Following on the first Chillagoe slump, however, Einas-
leigh was given a rest, and then taken in hand by a
London crowd with more money, apparently, than mining
sense. Woodhead, having his hands full of British
Broken Hill affairs, has been unable to give
any time to the Einasleigh, and the result is
a rather serious joke. It may be that ultimately people
used to the copper business will take hold of the show
and turn it into a serious industrial concern. The best
that can be said of it at present is that it will send along
100 tons of ore a day to the Chillagoe smelters. It was
the want of railway facilities that formerly caused Wood-
head to cease his energies at the mine.
* * * *
Stannary Hills (Q.) has had a first big crushing
of the low-grade stuff around the Central Hill shaft, and
it is disappointing : 6392 tons only gave 32*13 tons concen-
trates, worth £2637. It was expected that this ore, of
which there is a big and easily-worked body, would give
1 per cent, at least, but it pans out only just \ per cent., or
Bs. 3d. per ton. This ore can be broken and shot down
the old Central Hill shaft into trucks at Is. per ton ; and
other costs will amount to about 7s. This is very cheap
work, indeed, for North Queensland ; in fact, when it
proposed to work 1 per cent, ore, the co. raised a laugh
or two. But £ per cent, is bringing it down too fine.
There are, however, other deposits, including the 3 per
cent, ore in the Ivanhoe workings,; but the management
had built a good deal on working this in with the
poorer stuff. There is another low-grade body around the
Extended shaft; and this will be tried now.

The flutter in Johnsons, Bendigo, has come to
an ignominious end. As usual, Melbourne punters have
fallen before the greater knowledge of the Bendigo crowd.
The matter with Johnson’s, as was mentioned by The
Bulletin weeks before the slump took place, is that {told
has not been found away from the Collmann fault. The
rise just inside Johnson’s boundary shows Bft. of stone,
but very little gold. No one now counts up as of
importance the big block of “virgin ground” north of
Oollmann’s on which so much of the boom depended.
Worst of all, the gold at the Dagmar end looks like peter-,
ing out. fields are,down pretty well to the non-paying
point. This means, too, that North “Jacks” are being
badly booted, and calls appear within sight. If they arrive
another outburst of anguish will come from bitten Mel-
bournites who went for a recovery on North Johnsons on
their way down hill. The consolation ladled out to the
recent boomsters is that “exploratory work is being
pushed on so energetically in so many places that some
new development may be expected any day. ’ y-”’ s ]S
pretty, but it is only puff-pastry. If the gold isn t there
a thousand workings won’t find it.

Duke and Main Leads Consols, Maryborough
(Vic.), is at record prices. Most of the mining men had
put the claim down as a 20s. show, and there it would
have stopped if one of the Symes had not slipped out of
cheap Tongkah Harbors and bought into Duke and Main
Leads. The Duke lead is patchy, like all other deep leads,
and it is sweetening up its returns from one of its golden
jack-pots just now. But 365. a share ! —what alluvial
mine of late years has paid 365. in divs without a return
to call-paying? Least of all has this been the case on the
Duke gutter. In the co.’s mine the gutter is taking an.
east and west course. At the swirl of the lead good gold
ouo-ht to be got. But an east and west run of wash will
be across the combs of the slates. At the Duke United
that meant low yields. So, although Duke and Main
Leads returns show up, it is average results that have to
be estimated. The natural conditions in the Duke
United were a more or less patchy lead, an enrich-
ment at the junction of tributaries, and an enrich-
ment at a turn in the course of the gutter.
Is the Duke and Main Leads Consols, next-door, to escape
these conditions? Or is it entitled to claim that that
patchiness has disappeared merely because Burnt Creek,
away ahead, is on good dirt ?“

The directors made no bones about it at the
meeting of the Charlotte Plains (Vic.). “Can we not
have a last fling?” a never-say-die shareholder asked o
Drysdale Brown after he had announced that the corpse
was fatally dead. But Drysdale Brown, who had had the
support of H. H. Schlapp, didn’t think so ; they could
only just look round and hope for a buyer. What their
chances are of getting a buyer can best be judged by the
fact that the co. has spent £270,000, “ and not a penny of
it has gone to financiers or brokers.” The plant
cost something over £40,000. What can they get
for it now? Well, if there is any gentleman waiting to
lead a party across the Bed or some other sea, and is
looking about for a pumping plant, the co. may get a
buyer at a fair price ; otherwise there probably won’t be
enough to pay creditors in full, and shareholders at
present haven’t a hope of getting back the price of a bag
of peanuts. Everything went wrong. If half-a-dozen
cos. had been pumping on that lead the Charlotte Plains
might have paid ; as it was, playing a lone hand, it was
hit by the steady rise in the cost of fuel as it mopped up
the good timber in the neighborhood ; and, after the first
good patch was out, there wasn’t enough gold in the lead
to pay the piper. So out goes the last of the disastrous
bunch, which among them have spent £1,250,000 in the
district without getting even a sniff at a dividend.
Tasmanians look atjthe Great Pyramid tin float
open-eyed. An undeveloped tin mine on the north-east
coast lias been capitalised at £lOO,OOO, without including
shares in reserve. Then to hitch in 50,000 paid-ups and
to give them a market standing brings more concentrated
surprise. Either there is a surpassing belief in the possi-
bilities of the elaim, or there is a lack of knowledge of the
pitfalls that have hitherto beset the ardent tin expert
when in nor’-east Tasmania. The working capital is
dangerously small too. Take off brokerage and pre-
liminar} 7 expenses, and what is left leaves the Pyramid
standing on its apex instead of on a broad base of solid
cash.

Cecil Ryan has got his hydro-electric plant
going so well at the Pioneer, Bradshaw’s Creek (Tas.),
that the Board has given him a special ; holiday with a bit
of stuff in the pocket called “special recognition.” , Foot-
ballers describe the same material as “ boots.” The little
scheme took £38,000 ; but so fat is the mine
and so well has Ryan handled it that there
has never been a baulk at the bills. In the nine years
that he has run the property he has won 2990 tons of
stream tin from 3,110,000 cub. yards of drift, and has
kept divs. going-in a way that has exasperated every
other tin manager round him. Not to interfere with
divs. the Fatmen who own the Pioneer lately got a loan
of ten thousand from one of the gilt-edged bucks in their
midst, and it is proposed to wipe out this capital charge
in five years.

“Leo Lear”: Victoria’s Upper Murray
land is well worth the boost that “Jacq” (B.
12/8/ 09) gives it. The Melbourne stock reports
bear ample testimony to this, Upper Murray fats
always bringing top price, or not far from it.
1 wice have the powers looked towards this fertile
district with a view to railway, communication ;
but beyond a couple of. surveys the much-wanted
line is still in the atmosphere. The first survey
was run across the Talgarno ranges from
Bethanga, on the Tallangatta line, and thence
along the Murray to Towong. The sharpest
curves allowed were of 20 chains radius; but
when the sections were plotted the authorities
were staggered, for the plans showed five
™ nn ®l s i besides numerous banks and cuttings
of 40ft. and 50ft. Sharp spurs running off the
ranges to the river had to be got over or
through, there being no room for a 20-chain
curve round them. The section across Talgarno
Gap—good country in spite of its roughness—
resembled a crosscut saw magnified. So the
matter was dropped for many years. Then in
when there seemed some prospect of a
federal capital on Monaro (the Sydney-
Yassberra swindle being at that date unhatched),
the Upper Murray line was resurrected, as its
proposed terminus (Towong) was the nearest
point on the Victorian border to the promised
land. Ihe old route was closely adhered to, but
the curves were cut down to 10-chain radius,
and in places to even five—gee whiz ! A much
more respectable section thus eventuated, all the
tunnels being knocked out, and the prospects of a
line along the headwaters of the Big Trickle
seemed rather bright. The survey was within
firing distance of the terminus when some genius
hatched a stupendous water-storage scheme cost-
ing T 0,000,000 or thereabouts. The proposal was
to dam the Murray near Walwa for irri-
gation purposes. This put half the new
railway survey under water (on paper),
so further work was stopped, and the camp was
recalled. Ihus for the second time the Upper
Murray was cheated of its line. It now remains
to be seen what John Weary’s , Government can
do. A permanent survey has to be made—the
others were trials—and a few engineering
obstacles overcome. Re the matter of railway
surveys, Victoria contains almost as many of them
as bydney does aldermen—a drunk can’t even
walk across country without kicking a peg.

“ Vulcan ” : Speaking of horses, has the
oldest horse ever been found ? Theoretically, the
animal s mortal span is limited (like that
ot most mammalia ) to five times the
period it takes to reach maturity—say
20 to 25 years—while its actual fodder-
earning days (also theoretically) end
between the 20th and 25th year. In
cold, working practice, however, it
does much better than this, and I know
of frequent moke centenarians, so to
speak. On Jones Bros.’ Cadow sta-
tion, Forbes (N.S.W.), there’s a lady-
horse well over 42 years of age, and
she still earns her grass by donning
harness for the station’s odd jobs
several times weekly. There’s no doubt
about the genuineness of the animal’s
ancientness, as she was bred by, and
has never left the hands of, her present
owner. There are several other aged
horses on the same property ; one in
particular, a pony, being sprv enough at
28 to regularly pull the owner into Forbes

“Edyson”: Hugh Skews mamed Chumm’s
daughter Agnes in the Wesleyan Chapel at Hole-
and-Corner. Hugh was comparatively new to
Hole-and-Corner, having secured land in the dis-
trict only a few months earlier. He married
Agnes after about five weeks’acquaintance, and
must have been surprised and grieved when he
found that in doing so he had practically accepted
the responsibility of Agnes’s mother, Agnes’s
sister Susan, and Agnes’s brother George. Fortu-
nately old Chumm was dead, otherwise he too
would have added himself to Hugh’s family.
Skews was a thoughtful, sententious man, and he
bore things for nearly two months before breaking
into open revolt. One morning at the expiration
ot that time, I was passing Skews’ holding, riding
out to the mine, and saw George Chumm, who
was a lubber of about 25, Mrs. Chumm, and Susan
Obumm standing near the fence, among their
worldly possessions, which, it seemed, had been
thrown at them. Skews was just in the act of
entering his door, George Chumm was bellowing •
Yah, yeh cow ! If ye h couldn’t afford to marry’

I have seen a few planted for the

J.Gr. : -Ke that Queensland wheelbarrow-
pushing prospector (B. 2/9/’O9). Some years ago
an old German prospector, accompanied by his
son, passed through Wallan (Vic.) after a 500-
mile jaunt across the high lands of southern
N.S.W. and Gippsland. For the whole of that
distance they had pushed a wheelbarrow laden
with about half a ton of provisions, shovels, picks,
etc. The track traversed covered a lot of that
taken by explorers Hume and Hovell in 1827,
and was about as rough a one as could be
found in Australia, especially for wheelbarrow
shoving. The two had a spell of pros-
pecting in pretty well every gully they struck,
and the results were more or less, mostly less
satisfactory. After passing Wallan they reckoned
on making forLancefield, and putting in a holiday
at spud digging, after which they were going to
make to Inglewood or thereabouts to pick up a
few nuggets. I wonder if the old warrior who
wheeled his barrow into Charters Towers the
other week was the same immortal who astonished
the natives of Wallan,- Kilmore and thereabouts
years ago.
“ Yarrum ” : Talk about dirty luck ! A
man at Goonanible (N.S.W.) had been thrown
from young horses a score of times, and had had
37 bones broken—or it may have been 36; he
mislaid his tally-stick for a time. He had been
shipwrecked also as many times as Patrick Per-
kins, and had been carried unconscious from a
burning pub just in time to save his life. Yet in
the end he succumbed to the kick of a cow ; and
that kick was not meant for him, but for another
cow.

a yarn and I got it. First he told me how mis-
chievous magpies tore his tent ; at the same time
he clawed me down the bosom in a most violent
manner. Next he told me how he and Bill got

A BUSH GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
She’s milking in the rain and dark,
As did her mother in the past.
The wretched shed of poles and bark,
Bent by the wind, is leaking fast.
She sees the “ home-roof” black and low,
Where, balefully, the hut-fire gleams—
And, like her mother, long ago,
She has her dreams ; she has her dreams.
The daybreak haunts the drear}’ scene,
The brooding ridge, the blue-grey bush,
The “ yard ” where all her years have been,
Is ankle-deep in dung and slush ;
She shivers as the hour drags on,
Her threadbare dress of sackcloth seems—
But, like her mother years agone,
She has her dreams j she has her dreams.
The sullen “breakfast” where they cut
The blackened “ junk.” The lowering face,
As though a crime were in the hut,
As though a curse were on the place ;
The muttered question and reply,
The tread that shakes the rotting beams,
The nagging mother, thin and dry—
God help the girl ! She has her dreams.
Then for “ th’ separator” start,
Most wretched hour in all her life,
With “ horse ” and harness, dress and cart
No Chinaman would give his “ wife ” ;
Her heart is sick for light and love,
Her face is often fair and sweet,
And her intelligence above
The minds of all she’s like to meet.
She reads, by slush-lamp light, maybe,
When she has dragged her dreary round,
And dreams of cities by the sea
(Where butter’s up, so much the pound),
Of different men from those she knows,
Of shining tides and broad, bright streams ;
Of theatres and city shows,
And her release !- She has her dreams.
Could I gain her a little rest,
A little light, if but for one,
I think that it would be the best
Of any good I may have done.
But, after all, the paths we go
Are not so glorious as they seem,
And—if ’twill help her heart to know—
I’ve had my dream. ’Twas but a dream.

“Boswell”: White Australia has many
dark spots on it at Listnore, the metropolis of the
Richmond River (N.S.W.) cow district. At most
of the hotels your food is dished up by a Chinese
or Jap cook, assisted by a kitchenman of the same
colored clay. The laundries are named “ the
Tokio,” the “Hiroshima,” the “Nippon,” etc.,
and therein, amid the suds and steam, you behold
white girls toiling for a humble wage under
Asiatic bosses. Garibaldi and Demetrius, as usual,
control the fish trade ; while the traffic in fruit and
greengroceries mostly flows through Greek or
Syrian channels. Our Hindu brother pursues the
fancy goods business with his usual velocity;
theie are Chow grocers, and a prosperous boot
shop is run by two Beloocliees. With all his pre-
dilections for a white Australia, and incidentally
a white diocese, the late Bishop Doyle doesn t
seein to have carried sufficient heavy artillery to
stem the tide of Asiatic invasion on the Richmond.

“ X.P.D.” : The disclosures at the recent
inquiry into missionary floggings up north suggests
that the Commonwealth ought to insist upon a
record being kept of every corporal punishment
inflicted at every mission station ; and, besides
getting a copy of this record, the Commonwealth
should occasionally call to find out if possible
whether the record is a fake or not. At most
mission stations in Australia and Papua there are
only one or two other whites to see what the chief
priest does when in the half-demented state pro-
duced by loneliness and over-indulgence m
the Old Testament. Whilst in Papua, I
saw a misssionary put a charge of bird-
shot into a native simply because the nig.
laughed at the parson’s excitement. At another
Papuan village, an imported nigger-teacher told
me he intended to tie up a couple of young
women and beat them because they wouldn t
come to school. The same reverend person
had a young boy to cook and wash
for him, at nothing per week and lioeral
floggings. In the cases I have quoted
the natives, being Papuans of the Samoan strain,
stood it. When they haven't stood it, there have
been “ Massacres by Savages,” martyrdoms, and
men-o’-war. By the way, when that old-estab-
lished missionary, Rev. Shirley Baker, became
Prime Minister in Tonga, and started the Fr ee
Church of these isles —well, unless the other mis-
sionaries lied considerably, that new church
should have been called the Hard-Flogging Taber-

first idea when he starts a new religion is to buy
a cat and a collection-plate.

“Lad”: I rise in wrath to smite Soren-
sen’s sketch, “ The Cocky’s Natural Enemies (B.
12/8/’O9). I firmly assert that it is a libel on the
backbone of the country. According to Sorensen,
cocky’s life is one of incessant torment and
plague. Certainly the farmer has difficulties to
contend with, like any other person in any station
of life ; but his troubles are nowise comparable to
E.S.S.’s word picture. Admittedly there are ex-
eeptional cases of hardship, but the article
makes it a general matter ; and if that were
true, how is it that there is always such a
rush for holdings offered for settlement.' Soren-
sen asserts that the cocky’s hen-roosts “are
nightly visited by native eats and carpet snakes.
The former are as scarce as troglodytes m the
major portion of this State, and the carpet snake
is mostly as defunct as George Reid s Arid Log.
Regarding the alleged havoc played by the bandi-
coot, wallaby and ’possum in cocky’s cornfields, I
would like Sorensen to mention a few of the
localities where these animals exist so abundantly.
1 live in a large corn-growing district (Gundagai,
N.S.W.), and the bandicoot, wallaby and possum
are practically extinct. Further, I haven t been
able to make more than a casual acquaintance
with any of these beasts, though during the past
ten years I have been dumped down from one
place to the other —east, west, north and south
including the Far West. Certainly, the cockatoo
is a great pest and capable of any mischief. But
I know nothing of the wild pig ; he certainly is
not a pest to the N. S. Wales farmer except in
one or two outlying districts ; and then he hardly
amounts to a pest. As for cocky himself, in the
majority of cases lie is a happy, contented fellow,
following an avocation surrounded by everything
that is healthy and exhilarating; and the more
we get of him the better.
WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES.
DOOLAN ( the publican): “ Wot! Are yer leavin’?"
HI DUK (the cook whose room was next to the parlor): “Me all same leave. 'Fliteen two ,
fliteen fo’; come ou’si, you plully li’,’ all ni’—me gettem no sleep!
“Pick”: Talking of the intelligence of
bush men. I once camped on the Shoalhaven
(N.S.W.) with a paling splitter, who nightly
rasped out “The Girl I Left Behind Me” on a
violin of his own manufacture, in which no other
tools than an axe and pocket knife had been em-
ployed. Two kippered herring tins fastened upon
a piece of myrtle wood constituted the body of the
instrument. The head was fancifully carved and
blackened by scorching to represent an aboriginal
face with protruding tongue. The strings were of
wallaby sinews, and the bow of horsehair was
strained across a strip of bent hardwood. The
tone was not that of a Cremona; but I attended
more than one spree at which this bush violin
comprised the whole orchestra, and the Girl he
had Bolted From furnished nearly the whole of the
musical programme.
“Larrikin” : Apropos “ Coda’s” remarks
(B. 2/9/’O9), this is my experience of camels as
carriers of food. During the last drought
strings of camels and their Afghan drivers
used to go through Hughenden to Cloncurry
VIEW AT THE CANBERRA FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.
Mr Miches M.H.R. lately urged the House of Representatives to make haste and fix up the (be-
fore the People got a chance Express their views at an election) as the circumstances which made for the
selection of Yass-Oanberra might never occur again.
OUR OATH, not
and Boulia, and only for the camels people
out in those parts would have starved. But there
was a distinct musty flavor of camel about the
flour and all the other dry stuff; while as for
tinned provisions, they were so churned up by
the jog-trot gait of the camels that they were
nearly all fermented. 111-tempered brutes the
camels are too. The saying, “ it’s the last straw
that breaks the camel’s back,” is a mistake. It s
the first ounce that breaks the brutes up ; the in-
stant they feel the weight they let out a bellow,
and then snarl, showing their yellow ugly teeth ;
and after that they lash their tongues around in a
fury. On the Hughenden string was a man who
smote a camel in return for a vicious bite it gave
him. He forgot the episode, but the camel didn t.
One night he was camped with others, when the in-
furiated ship of the desert got loose from the
string, and went smelling round all the sleeping
men in the camp till it found its enemy. Him it
seized between its teeth, and the man was nearly
killed before his mates could get to his help.
“ Montalex About croc-fights. Let me
gently premise, for the benefit of “llinderino
(B. 26/8/’O9), that the crocodile isn’t a saurian.
The sauria are the true lizards only, whereas the
crocodilia belong to a much more highly organised
order of reptiles. I have seen many crocombats
in Sumatran and Bornean rivers, but always
between males, and for a world-old reason. One
memorable “scrap” : Was camped on a tributary
of the Kapuas, in Borneo, with another white
man and a Dyalc, when, early one morning, we
were roused by a terrific slashing and splashing
and grunting in the river. Two big crocs were
hard at it near the opposite bank, and the Titanic
struggle was being calmly watched by a third
croc, who was probably, the Dyak told us, “ the
lady in the case.” So rapid were the movements
of the infuriated beasts, and so mighty the
turmoil due to the fierce lashing of their tails,
that it was some time before we could make
out that one of the combatants was holding
like a bulldog to a fore-leg of the other, whose
portentous jaws were clashing vainly around in
search of an equivalent grip upon his antagonist.
Suddenly the mighty swirling ceased, and we
could see that the leg had been torn off and that
the former owner thereof had disappeared, leaving
behind him a liberal supply of crimson, ihen
the conqueror scuttled up the bank and com-
menced, presumably for the delectation of the
lady-croc., a series of the most amazing capers.
He bellowed and grunted and wheezed, thrust his
head and tail perpendicularly and ludicrously
high in air, and then set to spinning rapidly and
ridiculously round and round. I ended the circus
with a Marlin bullet, whereupon the “audience
splashed into the water and was no more seen.
We got our boat, crossed over, and put the tape
on the deceased, though the smell of musk nearly
knocked us down while doing it. He was 28ft. 3m.
A WIFELY ERROR.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
The rain slid through the starless night.
And weirdly blew the winter wind.
I saw them in the roving light
Of flaring lamps, extremely tight—
The blind conducting home the blind.
They stagg'ered to a broken gate,
And argued for five minutes more.
One said the hour was over-late
For further beers, and dragged his mate
Protesting to the cottage door.
Here still they argued, and at last
The door flew wide, a tyrant hand
Dipped for a drunk, and held him fast,
And on the matting he was cast,
With cries I could not understand.
And now from that dark cottage rose,
And waned and died and rose again,
The thud of kicks and horrid blows,
The sad appeal to ruthless foes
Of some strong drinker in his pain.
The man outside let up a “ hoy,”
And laughed till tears bedewed his cheek ;
Then danced he like a silly boy.
“ Oh, why,” I cried, “ this pagan joy?”
He laughed so much he couldn’t speak.
He held on by the garden gate,
And roared again in wicked glee,
All careless of his battered mate.
“ What is it, say ? Why so elate ? ”
“ She’s got the wrong man ! ” whispered he.

The Bulletin has found him at last, the
Scotch Jew, Donald Mclsaacs. But, alas! he
didn’t fit his name. He was just a sailorman,
and, being overloaded with Melbourne beer, he
was stuck up in a dark lane and relieved of his
good monish. What a name to waste like that !

most conspicuous things about Tommy Bent are
Ins ears. He doesn’t really have to hold them up off
the Melbourne streets on muddy days, but dogs
that stand any decent height above sea level sniff
at them m passing. When the Assembly was
discussing the land-jobbery of the Bent Govern-
ment one of Thomas’s friends stood up and
violently whitewashed that person, and Thomas
yelled, “’Ear, ’ear” every time the beauties of
his own character were alluded to. “It seems to
me,” said an angry M.L.A. at last, “ the member
for Brighton should be silent just' now. Why
draw closer attention to ears that are always too
much in evidence?”
“Albatross”: A Bulletin par.
(* 18 09) states that Bishop Biley was
once on a broken-down steamer on the
Westralian coast, that the rocket which
the captain tried to send up started to
rage around the deck and dodged be-
tween the bishop’s legs, that the bishop
asked the captain what he should do,
that the captain told him to run like
Hell, and that he ran like the place
mentioned. Barring the fact that you
omitted certain thrilling adjectives used
hy the captain, the story is fairly »*or*
rect. When the bishop ran like Hell
for a place of safety after the rocket had
dodged between his legs, the mate
howled with laughter at the spectacle of
his retreat. Half-way through the howl
the rocket struck the mate, and he had
to be buried. These things happened
on Burns, Philpand Co.’ss.s. McGregor,
between Albany and Esperance. Bishop
Biley had no luck at sea. He was on
a burning ship in the Atlantic. I was
shipmate with the bish. once on the
north-west coast, and a rock struck us
between Derby and Wyndham. And
the worst passage I ever made was in
the Bob Boy, between Albany and Es-
perance, with the bish. on board and
so deadly ill that he slept on deck for
the sake of peace and quiet.
Valentine Curtis Brigg, who bot-
tomed his last claim the other day at
Bockhumpton (Q.), had a small hold on
history. He it was who discovered the
famous “Curtis” nugget of Gympie’s
early days. It weighed nearly 841 b
(avoir.), and touched £4OOO in value’.
Brigg, however, didn’t get much out
°t it. Originally there were four partners—
a “sleeper” and three workers. One of the
latter had really withdrawn ; but on the
ground that he had not removed all his tools
from the claim he demanded his dividend with
the rest. Then the court work began, and Costs
ate all but a few crumbs of the nugget.
Hariiman, the IT.S. multi-millionaire, who

the five.

as champion Heavy Weight Face-pusher of the

return at all, the prophecy was really a good deal
less definite than it looked.

been proved at £15,000. A life interest is left to his
sister, On the death of Miss Muskett £lOOO a year is to
be distributed among charities and hospitals in all the
States. Likewise he provided for what is to be called

to make arrangements for offering-, every second year
after the death of Miss Muskett, a prize for an essay on
the prevention of infant mortality, the improvement of
Australian food habits, and the extension of technical
education in State schools. The prize will amount to
about £7OO in the first year, and will gradually increase
in value. Sydney School of Arts is to conduct the com-
petitions.

a time with the business side of The Bulletin.
Later he was sub-editor and then editor of the
Broken Hill Argus, and after 1889 was on papers
in Maoriland, Sydney and Melbourne. His death
reveals an unsuspected and a brave struggle with
pain and misfortune for the last 18 months.

From the Oldest Inhabitant :
Apropos the “unwritten law” and W. J. Foster
(B. 26/8/’O9). The late Judge even in his day had pre-
cedent for applying that “ law.” Some 40 years ago in
Victoria, a well-meaning man was worried by attentions
paid to his wife by a certain bloke. He threatened to
shoot if he ever found them in company again. He did
find the bloke out walking with the lady, and gave him a
charge of duck-shot in the calves. There were le°-al
troubles before a Judge who, when a young man had
also been a certain bloke. In the Judge’s case he was
suspected, the wily husband laid a trap, and, coming
home late (he was supposed to have gone on a country trip)-
he poured a quantity of small shot into the flying lawyer!
This little circumstance was well known to ; in
fact on an occasion where “morals” were spoken of in a
case before the same Judge, Purves bluntly alluded to it
Well, when the man was committed for trial for shooting
the bloke, he placed himself in the hands of the late O. b"
Dickenson, solicitor, who retained Ireland, Q.C., to defend'
Dickenson’s clerk, the late William Barton (buried last
year at ltookwood), took the client to see counsel. Ireland
heard the case, and advised a plea of “guilty.” “ Leave
the rest to me,” he said. The client objected, but was
over-ruled. He pleaded as directed. Then Ireland
spoke. He pointed out the anguish the bloke had occa-
sioned the accused husband, spoke of a blighted home
and blasted honor, etc. The virtuous Judge called for
the bloke, questioned him, and got a corroboration of
Ireland’s story. Then, addressing the said bloke, he told
him he should change places with the accused, sentenced
the latter to the rising of the Court, and at once rose.
COOK’S DISCOVERY OF THE POLITICAL
NORTH POLE.—(Vide next elections.)
J.C.: "By cripes! And that’s centigrade too!”
Cardinal Moran was 80 on the 16th. He
neither drinks nor smokes, and for years has
refrained from walking a yard by way of exercise.
He hears and sees as well as he did when a mere
lad of sixty. An ancestor is reputed to have
lived to the age of 107. No member of the
family dreams of dying short of 70, and when one
of them passes out at that age he does it with the
severe disapprobation of his relatives, who reckon
he isn’t keeping up the family credit.
~ The worst which can be said against Dr.
Fred Cook’s claim to have reached the North
no other white man was looking is that
W. 1. Stead, and a special correspondent of the
JLIMKS have accepted his statements as gospel.
On the other hand, the hona fides of Cook is
almost proved by the fact that the Daily Mail
man remains sceptical. Now the Daily Mail
swallowed De Rougernent whole.
A. O. Moriarty, who is still living at Goul-
burn (N.S.W.), was clerk of the Executive
Council when Queensland got its letters patent
apd became a separate State just 50 years ago.
Denison was Governor at the time, arid Forster
was Premier; and, according to Mr. Moriarty,
the pair feJl out badly over the business.
Finally, when it was all fixed up and Herbert
(afterwards Secretary to the Colonial Office
in London) was nominated Premier, Moriarty
accepted the job of Assistant Colonial Secre-
tary and Clerk of the Executive Council ;
and thus he had the job of carrying the
letters patent to Brisbane. At the last moment
there was nearly a hitch, the document
having gone astray in a carrier’s cart ; but
Moriarty commandeered an orderly’s horse,
and rescued it, though the Governor and
party had to do some waiting.
Hassan : Gardener Guilfoyle, whose
business it is to beautify the IMelbourne
Domain and Botanical Gardens, has a not-
able idea of beautification. His chief scheme,
so far as I can see, consists of rooting up the
grass and dumping down on the resultant
bare patches several hundred tons of blue-
stone spawls. Then his hirelings arrange
these spawls in lines, with their sharpest
ends sticking up to Heaven, and lo !—-a “rock-
ery,” looking like the front elevation of the
lower jaw of a grandfather shark. Mr. Guil-
foyle has ruined the fine slope of the Domain
down to the St. Kilda-road with a long line of
these “rockeries,” and is industriously cut-
ting down the trees which old Yon Mueller
planted. Ido not know whether he is re-
sponsible for the “pruning ” of the trees along
the streets, but if he is, I suspect that he em-
ployed a squad of plain-clothes police to do the
job. and these misguided men beat off the branches
with batons.
Bitter language by “ Oby ”
A niggling little Minister like Jim Hogue, of JSf.S. W.
Education Department, makes a State looks ridiculous by
the assiduity of his trotting after anything that smells of
rank or station. If he trotted bv himself the eccentricity
would be only so big, but Jim drags behind him crowds
of defenceless children from the State schools. His
current dart is presenting—at, of course, the country’s
expense—to various schools large framed photos, repre-
senting the unfurling of Lord Boberts’ flag by Lady
Poore. The schools thus honored by Jim are those that
took part in the Dreadnought display on Empire Day
the inference being that the kids of these schools are the
true salt of loyalty—as salt as Jim himself.
One James Joseph Rooney applied for an
old-age pension at South Melbourne last Week,
and apologised profusely for so doing. He had
for many years been a storekeeper at Daylesford,
but a fire ruined him. Then for many more years
he was a hawker, but growing infirmities made it
difficult to hawk with sufficient activity. After
that he bottle-ohed for a crust till a broken arm
incapacitated him, and at the age of 94 he asked,
with many apologies, for his pension. But for his
accident he would never have troubled the Court.
The Court cut him short by awarding the full
amount, and told him not to apologise any more.
In the Daly-Willis case, Mr. Mack (allud-
ing to the Land Scandals): “But you were the
king in all this?” Willis : “No, I was the Grave
digger,” (laughter in court.) Noteworthy: Crick,
Close, and McNair, three principals in the Lands
cases are dead.
By the Oldest Inhabitant :—
Dead at Melbourne recently, William Henry Boussarde,
the oldest advance agent and theatrical manager in the
Australian States, aged 89 years. In the early ’fifties he
piloted Kate Hayes, the “ Irish Nightingale," to Hobarr,
and did the same duty a little later on for Lola Montez
and Emma Stanley. He was manager for John Black,
who built the first Theatre Royal, Melbourne. His pass-
ing leaves H. P. Lyons the patriarch of advance or touring
agents. In the ’fifties Lyons was in advance of Barlow and
Thatcher, and later he was with Fred Younge, Dominick
Murray and Robert Osborne. Still he reckons he doesn't
feel the cold feet of age creeping upon him.
The late C. B. Finlayson, Vic. Crown
Prosecutor, is rather disrespectfully remembered
in Melbourne as the man who of yore reduced the
prosecution of land-boomers and bank directors
to a solemn farce. A lot of public outcry was
needed to compel the Crown Law Depart-
ment to take action, and when the loose
financiers came to be prosecuted it was felt
that the charges were not forcibly driven
home. Finlayson had the handling of them, and
they failed in nearly every case. Yet he was said
to be a deadly prosecutor, in his unemotional way,
where the characters of influential citizens were not
involved. A native of Jamaica, the late Finlayson
had apparently a touch of the tar brush in his
ancestry. In legal circles O’Hara Wood is spoken
of as a certainty for the position which the deceased
filled for so many years.
The plaint of “ 0.C.C.” :—-
That great man and mighty poseur before the Law,
John Madden, has apparently joined the Stinking Fish
party, and now goes round with thedead herring of objur-
gation and the decayed mullet of slander in his hand, ready
to hurl them at the country which has treated him so
much better than he ever deserved. Blown up with a
pair of impossible moustaches and . the fatuous boosting
of the Melbourne Argus arid Herald, John, on or off the
bench, lectures for ever and ever, words without end !
Daily he is “ surprised,” or “ shocked,” or “ astounded ” ;
daily the. Argus reports that something* or somebody is
“deplorable,” or “inconceivable,” or “ a national peril ”
—according.to the view John takes of it, or him, or her—
generally it’s a her. In John’s jaundiced and inaccurate
eye the average Australian is low, common, ignorant,
vulgar and irreligious ; the average, young Australian is
all these, and disrespectful as well ; also lost !
Our youths (according to John) have no manners,
no manliness; our maids no modesty. In fact,
if the lamentations of John may be believed, we
have very few maids, except old ones. John shrieks
for. curfews, parental *■“ discipline,” and such. Soon 1
hope to hear him howling for the segregation of the
sexes ; then his real absurdity will be revealed. He has
so got into the habit of lecturing* to death poor, povertv-
stricken petty criminals on the enormity of their conduct
that now he sees the people of Australia in the same light.
Nothing they do can be right. Indeed, John is already a
first-class Wowser, and is rapidly growing* virulent and
personal. From his Olympian £3OOO-a-year height he
declaims and fulminates, and hurls vast chunks of
ancient codfish at us; and the Argus and the Herald
print it all and 'call him “Victoria’s Most Prominent
Citizen.” And thereupon he goes out and does it some
more. How are the people in other parts of the world to
know that .he is only a mountain of arrogance and flam-
boyancy? Yet that is about what he is.
THE END OF THE CONFERENCE.
Deakin and Cook sternly deny that the new naval
agreement is a practical adaptation of the Fisher scheme.
HIS WORKING PARTNER: “But that was my idea
t’ start working for ourselves!”
THE INCUBUS (proudly): “ Yes, hut I went one
better, than you, with your beastly plebeian
ideas about working. I hinted at a loan of
a few million so’s I could make him a decent
present and hang on a bit longer, and — well,
he not only refused to take anything but
actually offered to pay me £250,000 a year if
Td clear out and look after myself!”
Particulars are to hand as to Sydney
Beer-Baronet Tooth’s newly-acquired Chester-
field estate. The beautiful old mansion is in
(England), where Archbishop
Vaughan, of Sydney, came from. It had been
in the Chesterfield family for 600 years. With its
carvings, its gardens, its ancient deer forests, its
nine miles of salmon fishing (preserved) in the
River Wye, its shooting, its villages and its farms,
it is considered one of the most beautiful English
homes. The estate comprises 3396 acr es in all, or
over five square miles of country. You can crowd
a lot of deer and fish and polite Hodge into five
square miles in crowded little England.
STANZAS CONCERNING A PERSON OF SOME
IMPORTANCE.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Among: the passengers who arrived by the Marama
"as Mr. F. W. Ward, who represented the Sydney Daily
Tklugrapii at the Imperial Press Conference. — Comforting
news item.
Like a lone drunk who, in the early morn,
With swollen head to his abode repairs,
So “ Whiskers,” weary, travel-stained and worn,
Hitherward fares.
At ’Ome he tasted of the wine that cheers
(Likewise inebriates and turns the head);
At banquets with the haughtiest of peers
He yarned and fed.
He saw Ma’s ships of war—the hefty fleet
That keeps our Parent going on the blue ;
But still he thinks the Cerberus is meet
For me and you.
Now that he has returned, concuss the drum
And blow the blatant bugle without pause ;
Now HE is here, bright days must surely come
For Freetrader cause ! . . . .
Capital in his absence bolted fast;
’Twas useless to attempt to stop its flight;
We saw' it with its carpet-bag rush past
In the still night.
We need our Ward to sit upon its head,
Also to bury deep a gruesome list;
(Poor little Dreadnought ! Yes, our darling’s dead
And sadly missed !)
Full well we know that things from good to bad
Have travelled since Ward left us on the strand ;
But now he’s back we feel no longer sad.
(Stir up that land !)
Welcome back home ! Observe, we go in haste
To find some ink and dust the sacred lair !
Resume the pen, the scissors and the paste,
And take the chair !
Now' sit we dow’n upon our hams to note
How Capital Will stop all out of breath,
And Freetrade cease the rattling in its throat
That heralds death.
Turn on the Tap of Knowledge ! How we yearn
To see the bubbling Fount of Wisdom play!
Long—long have we awaited His return !
“ Hip—hip— Hooray ! ”
VICTORIA.
HARRISON OWEN.

SCIENCE SPEAKS.
In the treatment of any wound or sore, you
must not disregard the facts revealed by
scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanently it is essential to cleanse the affected
. . tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
■* at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while allaying all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies thoroughly.
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wounds, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases inmases of long standing.

MADEHELPLESS
BY SCIATICA.
♦
This Woman Couldn't Move
Without Help.
♦ —
Cured by the Treatment that
Restored Her Nerves to Their
Proper Condition.
The sharp shooting pains of sciatica in the hips
and legs make it one of the most painful diseases
medical men have to deal with. It is a dis-
ease of the sciatic nerve—the largest nerve of the
body.
The complaint has often been cured by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, a striking instance pf a cure
being given below. They have cured the com-
plaint because they are a nerve tonic and blood
builder.
“About three years ago I felt a sudden pain in
my left leg and hip,” said Mrs. Selina Batty, of
Simson, via Havelock, Maryborough Railway
Line, Vic. “ Shortly after, the pain extended to
my right leg and hip. I was in terrible agony.
I could not walk or get out of bed without suffer-
ing the most intense agony. When I did get out
of bed it was only with the assistance of my
husband and daughter, and then I could not move
about without the use of a stick. No one could
understand what I suffered. Eventually I con-
sulted a doctor, but his treatment did not do me
any good. After suffering torture for about six
months, my sister, Mrs. Rogan, persuaded me to
give a trial to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, I did,
and persevered with them. In a short time I
was able to walk about without a stick or any
assistance, and could attend to my household
duties again. After I had taken about five or six
boxes I felt splendid, but I kept on with them
until I had used about ten boxes. I have not had
the slightest return of pain or ache of any kind.
I have no hesitation in saying that Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills cured me, and made a new woman of
me.” .
Remember, only the genuine Dr. Williams
Pink Pills cure. Don’t be gulled into taking
something said to be just as good. Of all
dealers at 2s. 9d. per box, 6 boxes 15s. 3d., or from

POLITICAL
POINTS
Dooley, M.L.A. for Lithgow (N.S.W.),
has moved for a return showing the number of
law cases the Ma State has lost since 1905, the
cost of same, and the amounts paid to the
various legal lights who have manfully but unsuc-
cessfully held up the losing end of the log. This
return would be very interesting, but Dooley will
have a lot of luck if he gets it, and a lot more if
he gets it in a complete form.
AT THE LAST MOMENT.
If any grave national emergency—such, for instance, as
a threatened invasion—arose, it would be perfectly fair
and legitimate for the Commonwealth to resort to direct
taxation. — Geo. Reid.
In our hour of need; also, the Man of the Hour.
Though Fat alleges that the two-party
system is its ideal, it doesn t make any bones
about breaking away when there are only two
parties and causing the redundance which it says
it feels so shocked about. The newest breakaway
is composed of part of Premier Weary’s following,
which calls itself the Victorian Country Party.
The Ministry is mostly Country itself, but judg-
ing from its statements the new party consists
mostly of extra-tough Tories who fear that.
Weary’s mild little land-tax will drive a'
capital. Meanwhile, judging from the faoMldfctt
Berwick Shire Council, after passing a
“ viewing with concern the proposed land-tax,”
has decided to stick to a rating valuation admit-
tedly 60 per cent, below its proper figure, the new
Country party might well re-christen itself the
Dishonest party, or the Cadging party.
Waterloo, an unsightly portion of suburban
Sydney, is one of its43(orso) pocket-handkerchief
municipalities. The State Governor is to make a
voyage of discovery out Waterloo way shortly,
and the Waterloo mayor and the Waterloo town
clerk haven’t got any official duds for the occa-
sion. So the Waterloo Council has voted £ll
with which to deck the twain. This is one of the
arguments in favor of Greater Sydney, for one
dud costs a lot less than 43 duds. Also it is one
of the difficulties in the way, for 43 dud-wearers
voting against their own abolition amount to much
more obstruction than one dud-wearer would.
The great city of Glasgow recently arose
to remark that there must really
be something wrong with the
industrial affairs of Freetrade
Scotland. Out of the members
(30,760 in all) of 42 trades unions
5061 were unemployed—almost
one-fifth of the total. And it
must be remembered that the
unionist is a man with a de-
finite trade —a person who comes
off much better in evil times
than the casual shiftless unorgan-
ised worker. Glasgow has a
population of 860.000 people.
Deduct females, boys below
working age, and men beyond
the working age, and there are
probably between 200,000 and
250,000 working males in Glas-
gow. It is alleged that 50,000
of them are out of employment.
The members of the local
Distress Committee have re-
signed almost bodily on the
ground that the case is be- J
vond them, and the other
day Glasgow, the great
stronghold of the Foreign-
trade folly, staggered the Em-
pire by returning a tariff reform
candidate.
That imitation which is the sincerest form
of flattery has fallen to the lot of the Federal
Labor men. The Fused Government’s party has
decided to hold a weekly caucus, just the same as
it has always denounced the Fisher people for
doing and on exactly the same lines.
The Greater Sydney League has met with
an experience which is so common as to be really
not worth mentioning. It has appealed for
sympathy and support to all classes, and has got
it pretty freely except among the commercial
people. In that respect it is no worse off than
other reformers. The importer, the trader and
the bagman represent, in a political sense, the
most hopeless sections of the community. Their
ignorance in public matters is iricredible. Their
bigotry is vast. Their anti-Australian prejudices
are illimitable. Their narrow-mindedness is a
world’s record. The commercial class is the
despair of a progressive and democratic com-
munity. Apart from its bag it knows the
minimum, and the attempt to enlist it in any
effort for the advancement of the country is
almost hopeless.
The S. Aus. Labor party, which used to
be a very happy family, is fizzing like a seidlitz
powder, and “ Traitor ! ” is a common
thing to hear nowadays. When Peake
managed to keep breath in his Minis-
terial body the Labor party decided that
it was to be a case of no quarter ; pairs
even were not to be arranged as a general
thing. The other night the Government
had let some of its half-and-half sup-
porters fade out of sight, when in shot
a motion taking the business out of
the Government’s hands. A division was
called for; whereupon Archibald (ex-
leader of the Labor party), and Senior
and Winter, both Labor men, said they
didn’t believe in things like that, and
crossed over. But the three are getting a
lot of support; for S. Australia is just
the sort of State to say that it wants its
man to win victories on principles and not
on accidents ; and that’s practically what
Archibald and the other two did say.
The agitation for the removal of
Caulfield (Vic.) racecourse has disclosed
the surprising fact that the trustees have
no revenue—-that is to say, the V.A.T.C.
gets the use of the ground (which be-
longs to the public) for absolutely
nothing, while it won’t even let a small
peanut boy inside the fence on race-days
unless he planks down at least a florin.
Premier Murray now proposes that the
club shall pay £5OO a year for five years,
the same to be spent on improving that
part of the reserve that isn’t used for
racing, and the interested parties pretend
to be very seriously considering the matter.
It’s a cold day when the Victorian House
of Rich Landlords can’t find an excuse for block-
ing humane legislation. Last week, egged on by
Davies, Bent’s Attorney-General, the fatmeii
postponed and threatened to defeat a motion for
a Wages Board for the paper making trade, on
the ground that there was only one employer in
that business in the State. Davies’ only argu-
ment was that “it was never contemplated that
there should be a Wages Board in such a case.’’
Yet in such cases a Board may be even more
necessary than usual, because the monopolist oan
lower wages to the vanishing point without fear
of having his best employees snapped up by trade
competitors,
A. demand for Federal industrial legisla-
tion' and for the union label arose last week in an
,*mexpected quarter. Dr. Wilson, M.H.R., a
Tory member from Victoria, cried out for “ uni-
form Federal legislation ” to “ control the regis-
tration of members of the medical, legal and other
professions,” and he complained bitterly about
scabs and blacklegs who haven’t the proper union
label on their brass plates. He was absolutely
against State Rights as concerning his own and
kindred professions, and he was anxious to see
coercion and intimidation applied to the free
■laborer. He was even so brutal as to call the non-
unionist a “quack,” which is a coarse expression
and one that should be put down.
Dr. Arthur, M.L.A., has discovered what
statistics have been proclaiming since the blight
of Cobdenism began—that England has so dis-
couraged the agriculturist that he no longer flour-
ishes, and is, therefore, unavailable as an
immigrant. The young Englishman to-day is as
innocent of the bucolic profession as his progeni-
tor was of aeroplanes. He has drifted to the
cities and towns in search of something to eat or
drink. Foreign-trade and game-preserves evicted
the yeomanry, and their descendants are scarcely
the type suited for the wheat areas of Australia.
So Dr. Arthur’s dream of immigration is rudely
disturbed.
AFTER THE CAT.
Political leadership in Australia has declined to the
cult of the jumping cat. —Ask.
Old Hen. Willis, M.H.R., propounded the
amazing theory last week that the Australian
High Commissioner “should be a non-party man ;
he should be neither Protectionist nor Free-
trader.” In other words he should be either an
ignoramus or an idiot. It is a pity Willis didn’t
add that the ideal man must be neither a religious
believer nor an unbeliever ; that he should neither
drink nor abstain from drink ; that his complexion
shouldn’t be fair Or dark; that he should be an
Australian, but not from any of the States lest
his appointmant should arouse prejudice; and
that he should be either a tall dwarf or a very
small giant.
“ J.P.” ; If the Greater Sydney movement
wants an object-lesson to stiffen its spine, it can
look across to Christchurch (M.L.). Some years
ago that city, with 75,000 people, was gloriously
mismanaged by about six alleged councils that
fought and wrangled and did nothing. Then the
Greater Christchurch scheme biffed the squabbling
mass of councillor and its disunited dustcart and
its unremoved dead dog into eternity, and re-
placed it with an efficient, business-like Board.
Now there are no fights, reforms come speedily,
improvements are numerous, the council does its
work so expeditiously and noiselessly that no one
is really aware of its existence, and the dead dog
is removed before it has time to resume its howl-
ing.
The hardshell Tories of the Victorian State
Assembly put all they knew into their struggle
to bowdlerise the new Electoral Bill. After they
had succeeded in knocking out the preferential
vote, Mackey wanted to extend the postal voting,
facilities to women who might be hindered from
going to the poll by domestic duties. That being
rejected he wanted the privilege extended to those
engaged in maternal duties, which vague descrip-
tion was amended to mean those “engaged in the
care of children of tender years” ; and that being,
about equally vague, both amendments were
fired out. Then Cussen wanted the postal
vote extended to all women in shires, but
he had no luck with that either. Next,
Cullen wanted the property owner to have
an optional vote for any electorate he held pro-
perty in; and that was likewise tossed aside.
There were sundry other amendments, all tending
to lessen the secrecy of the. ballot or. to advantage
the property owner as against the rent-paying,
citizen ; but they were all heaved aside, and the
Bill was passed on to the mercy of the Landlords,
who are pretty certain to extend the precious
postal vote all they can. For reasons well known
to themselves, the employing classes have an
abiding love for the postal vote.
The Old Soldier tells some Court secrets:—
The story of the Spanish succession during the last 70-
odd years is one of the disgraceful things in European
Court intrigue; and nobody can be surprised that it
should end in revolution. When that tyrant, Ferdinand
VII., after being driven from the Spanish throne by the
people and restored by a French army, Anally died in
1833, he left twoyoung daughters. When they reached
a marriageable age in 1846, Louis Philippe, King of the
French, anxious to provide for his family, wanted to
marry the elder girl, Isabella, to one of his sons, so as to
get for him the soft billet of King of Spain ; but the
British Government stepped in, fearing that sooner or
later the alliance might mean war, and so it was arranged
that Isabella should be married to a relation of hers
who was physically and mentally quite unAt, At
the same time Louis Philippe’s son, Montpensier, was
married to Isabella’s young sister, so as to make as nearly
sure as could be that the Orleans family would have the
succession. Isabella found plenty of compensation
among the smart and amorous oAicers of the Spanish
army for her husband’s deficiencies, but after about 20
years the quarrels of her lovers caused her expulsion.
She, however, had a son, though no one ever pretended
to name his father. Spain tried a republic, then an
Italian Prince as King (but he refused to stay), and at
last it fell back on Isabella’s son as Alphonso XII. He
died, and the present King was born just in time to suc-
ceed him. The Spanish people know the story perfectly,
and if now and then they show their disgust at the
whole Court business, who can wonder at it ?
The other day the Sydney Water and
Sewerage Board furnished its annual report to
Parliament, and almost on the same day. the
Auditor-General’s report dropped in. And this
was what happened :
According to According to

The difference is not tremendous; but there
oughtn’t to be any difference at all, and the fact
that a public body is allowed to tell Parliament
that its deficiency is £4031, whereas according to
the Auditor-General it is over 50 per cent, more
calls for some attention.
“ Harrison O. ” : J. Bull is beginning to
sit up and realise things. Here is a slab of horse
sense taken from the Saturday Review :
The man who is patriotic enough to serve in the Terri-
torial Army is likely to be absolutely handicapped in
time of stress. ' Two men are working side by. side. The
“Terrier” is taken, while his fellow workman actu-
ally scores by his patriotic endeavor, because as workmen
become scarcer wages rise. Compulsion would rectify
this. The burden would fall equally on all. Moreover,
IT IS QUITE CLEAR NOW THAT COMPULSION MUST
COME. Let us pray that it may not come only as the
outcome of some terrible national disaster, when all
efforts at redress will be unavailing.
If Australia does not soon get a move on its aged
parent will spring ahead ol it in this matter yet.

VEGETARIAN WAR SONG.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
There is, it goes without saying, no objection to the
starting of such farms by people who wish to spend their
money in that way. The objection is to the associating
of the farms with the historic Dreadnought movement.
The farms have nothing whatever to do with the move-
ment. They would not express its spirit. They would
not be a fitting monument. Why expose a patriotic in-
cident to inextinguishable laughter? —Pathetic editorial
footnote to letter in Sydney Telegraph.
The world’s applause cheers not the wight
Who grows the useful spud,
Or seeks to baffle Irish Blight
And grow a field of wheat aright,
Instead of spilling blood.
No glory lurks in stacks of hay
Or fields of peaceful grass ;
The patriot who pays away /
His treasured gold, looks for some gay
Return for it. Alas !
Imagine now, in humor grave,
The British wrath of those
Who in a warlike frenzy gave
Ten Pounds or One-and-Six to save
The Empire from its foes.
No fighting ship for their good cash
Do they receive. Instead,
The cabbage that assists the hash
To fill the boarder loud and rash,
Comes flying at their head.
The pumpkin is a peaceful crop,
The turnip knows no war ;
No vegetable truck would stop
To flourish did Old England’s shop
Shut up for evermore.
And so the patriot recoils
As from a deadly blow,
And now his inmost spirit boils
To think that his donated spoils
May help a cabbage grow.
N.S.W.
FOE.
A PRIMROSE PLAINT.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Speaking at Glasgow, Lord Rosebery characterised the
■ British Budget proposals as harassing, inquisitorial,
bureaucratic, tyrannical and predatory. No form of pro-
perty was safe ! —Cable item, Monday's press.
Kindly gather round and listen
To this Primrose tale of woe !
Let your eyes with teardrops glisten
In a free and ample flow !
Here’s a Peer (Oh dear, God bless us,
That such brutal things should be !)
Who (the fact should much distress us)
From taxation is not free !
In his youth in tartan garb he
Swore by old Ben Lomond’s head
To be Premier, win the “Darby,”
And to be in splendor wed
To the richest girl in Britain !
And no idle boast made he,
For the fact has to be written :
He contrived to do all three !
He has coin galore, and castles
(Not our Amy, thank the Lord !)
Swarms of tenants ; faithful vassals
Humbly bending at his word !
Now his Party wish to tax him !
Let us wail a woeful whine
And recall the grand old maxim :
“ Grease, oh grease, the fatted swine !”

ARE YOU GOING GREY?
Only those who are afflicted know the disabilities and
disadvantages of premature greyness. Many women,
who are,really quite young, look years older than their
age, and are considered back numbers by their own contem-
poraries. A few years ago it was considered impossible
to cure greyness, but Mrs. Cowling, of the Hygeia
Institute, has demonstrated otherwise, and has achieved
most remarkable results by her individual treatment. Siie
uses no dyes or stains, prescribing- for each case its own
merits, restoring health to the scalp and vigorous growth
to the hair with its original color.
Mrs. Cowling gives free consultations every afternoon
but Saturday from 2.15 to 4.45, and on Wednesday even-
ing by appointment between 0 and 7 p.m. Anyone who
cannot call should write to her, as her treatment can
quite well be carried on in the patient’s own home. If
you send 3d. in stamps she will send you a dainty and
instructive booklet. The address is :—'

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 14, 1909.
My Dear Akini,—
Members of the Bush Brotherhood have been
making quite a little social splash in Sydney
during the past few days. Mrs. Colonel Onslow
gave an “At Home” for them at the Fiona
residence, which her affluent husband rents from
the Knox people; and on Monday Lord Dudley
was billed to preside at a St. James’ Hall meeting
where the Brothers were to talk about their woik
and pass round the inevitable hat. The Bush
Brother is something unique in the clerical line.
He has his headquarters at Dubbo. He is
frequently a scion of Britain’s old nobility;
some of him, for example, have been A.D.C.’s.
He never has any money. He is sworn to celi-
bacy, and so rarely marries before 30. When on
business bent, he is mostly to be discerned
flying along the arid tracks of Outback
athwart a bicycle with no luggage abroad
barring a clean collar, toothbrush and a
Bible. The Word is thus carried to the outer-
most portions of Beyond. The Bush Brother
declines absolutely to join in the lively sectarian
scraps which are the alpha and omega and the
entire meaning, essence and purpose of soul-saving
in most country parts. The Bush Brother holds
that warfare between “Good Carthlicks 5 ’ and
“Staunch Prodistants” is unnecessary to the
anti-Beelzebub job. The son of the soii who has
been instructed to the contrary by his spiritual ad-
visers for years past naturally regards this view as
new, not to say revolutionary ; yet on the whoie he
is inclined to acclaim the Brother “agood bloke.”
Occasionally lie goes further and expresses the
opinion that ue is “ a dashed good bloke.” At
last Federal elections a Bush Brother named
Mathews got up on a public platform in Dubbo,
and advanced the theory that Mr. G. Reid’s anti-
Socialist arguments were disingenuous and non-
sensical, and unworthy of credence. He ended
by intimating that he meant, personally, to vote
for the Labor man in that constituency. A wail
of amazed protest went up from the local solicitors,
auctioneers and bankers. They opined that the
divine had gone raving mad. They banned him
from their houses, tore their names forcibly from
the Brotherhood’s subscription list and took their
souls to be cured elsewhere. But the onrush
of time has shown that Mathews was pretty well
right, and anyhow the hostility to the Brothers,
who do an immense amount of unobtrusive good,
was bound to die out soon. Latterly the institu-
tion has been booming considerably ; and soon it
it expected that the bicycles of the missioners will
be as locusts in the land.
Last week Norman Lindsay’s pictures made
Angus and Robertson’s Gallery the Mecca of true
believers in pen and ink artistry. Most of the
artist’s principal illustrations—originals of those
used in The Lone Hand—were exhibited, as well
as some of his large water colors. “The Roman
Banquet” was acquired by some one for
£26. Norman Lindsay is the discoverer of the
Australian bear. He will draw 100 bears, and
whilst keeping them all pure bear will give each
a separate bearality. The run on the Lindsay
bears has been as keen as the rush of the she bears
that galloped through Holy Writ to devour
42 children (2L to each bear) who told the
bald prophet to “get work,” or some such
vulgarity.
The Norman Lindsay picture show was a big
financial success. Within an hour of its opening
on private view day Mr. William Dixson strode in
and bought every bear on the walls. The library
of Mr. Dixson contains, next to the Mitchell
library', the finest collection of old Australian
M.S.S., pictures and coins in the Commonwealth.
The rather shocking problem picture puzzled
some and enraged more. In the end a
curious arrangement was come to in regard
to it. A watcher was stationed outside
the gallery. When a party of noted pietists
was seen to be approaching he uttered a long
moaning cry, and fell under the nearest counter.
Then an attendant rushed at the picture and tore
it madly down, and bore it away to a remote spot
and covered it up and sat on it. When the
pietists were gone, the picture-concealer emerged
cautiously and. re-hung his shameful burden,
shuddering violently the. while. The artist
watched this ceremony every time it occurred
with never-flagging interest, albeit somewhat
dazedly. As he pointed out, he was no business
man, and had, consequently, never seen anything
of the kind before.
The prettiest of the portraits, and the most life-
like, was that of Mrs. Sydney Jamieson. She
has the fine profile which draws well and
daintily’, and was skilfully posed. There were
two pictures of Mrs. Herbert Marks, and the
twain are charming studies. Mrs. Roohaix, who
is a beautiful young party, made an effective pic-
ture; and Mrs. J. C. Williamson was regal and
statuesque in proximity to a pedestal or flower-
stand or other article of furniture.
Apropos, I cut this deliciously naif effort from
the Sydney Telegraph’s notice of the show last
week
In the first place, it is s unewhat extraordinary that
personal portraits of Sydney’s society ladies should be
exposed for sale at all.
It suggests that the p iper’s sheep and cow expert
has inadvertently broken into the art and letters
section. Gorgeously provincial is the idea that
“real ladies” may not, without outraging the
convenances,, allow their portraits to be priced,
catalogued and exhibited in a gallery.' At every
Paris Salon and Loudon Academy there are hung
scores of priced and catalogued portraits—good,
bad and infamous —of well-known women.
A proportion of them, as in the Nor-
man Lindsay show, are ’commissions. How-
ever, the majority aren’t, and the public is
as much at liberty to buy the counterfeit present-
ments of the ladies, if it pays the jot-ices asked, as
it is to acquire the photographic representations
of them, which they joyfully supply to the six-
penny and twopenny weeklies. As 1 write, the
price-catalogue of the 1905 Academy is before me.
It contains a score of portraits of well-known
Englishwomen, ranging in rank from a Marchion-
ess—her of Camden —down to a mere knightly
wife, Lady Webb, for whose portrait her lI.A.
husband was responsible. With one exception,
they were all for sale (the pictures, not the ladies)
to the first comer, and at moderate prices. It
would be absorbing in this connection to know
the exact class of female whom the Telegraph
considers may be presented to the public gaze
without outraging the sensibilities of right-
thinkers. Presumably no one above the social
rank of a housemaid is eligible—and if the damsel
happened to be imported there would be qualms
and doubts even in regard to her.
The Art Society is selling a fair number of its
exhibits, and holding the usual and always suc-
cessful At Homes and smoke nights. On Satur-
day eve Mrs. Lister Lister was hostess for one of
;the society’s entertainments, when song, recita-
tion and piano entered into a merry scheme of
things. Messrs. Lister Lister, Dattilo Rubbo,
Hanson, Daplvn, Jackson and Minns, and a
number of girl artists have found buyers. Miss
Huntley’s “Evelyn” lias won admiring com-
ment, and so has the big canvas, “ The
Gossips,” which shows work of strength and
promise. Norman Carter’s “Wine Press”
will add another coat of lustre to his
reputation. In the Miniatures section Miss
Gladys Lav cock shows a lot of examples. Her
presentments of “Marjorie” and Mr. Matthew
Harris are satisfactory. Miss J ustine Kong Sing’s
“Lady in Brown” I liked best of her four ex-
hibits. Miss Berenice Edwell. another consci-
entious miniaturist, has made good in this section.
In sculpture Mr. G. W. L. Hirst has scored with
the portrait bust of an aged woman “Eighty-
eight,” which the Gallery has acquired.
The Powerful is steaming this way, and in the in-
terval between taking coal aboard and taldngfligbt
abroad, there to re-commission, the large grey vessel
will tender its Sydney friends a dance. A point of
etiquette which lias often exercised me is: Who may
really be said to give a warship dance, the officers
or the men ? Certainly the former provide the
liquid and other refreshments; on the other hand,
the A.B.’s perform all the hard labor, and do it,
so far as I can learn, gratis. On these worthy tar-
encrusted mariners falls the labor of hanging flags,
fixing up “sitting out” retreats, arranging cloak-
rooms, chalking decks and a hundred other
things which are essential to a properly-conducted
hop or spring, and yet appear to be no part of the
duties of a member of the King’s navy. The
problem which gets me down in an intellectually
worried condition is why the tar-besmeared one
may not have the privileges of a host even as his
superior officer has. Why mayn’t he ask his girl
aboard to gaze on the fair work of his hands ? A
ball at which frolicked not merely the effete
members of our old nobility, but also the simple,
artless children of nature from Darling Harbor
and environs, would have obvious points of
interest.
Things are to be gay in the dance line. The
Australian Club intends to give a gorgeous affair
of the kind in the Town Hall. The members of
Lord Dudley’s staff will entertain their friends at
Government House early in race-week. And Mrs.
Ewan Frazer is expected to drape and festoon her
house on Bellevue Hill for the same cheerful
purpose and at about the same time.
“Conversazione (in big black lettering). Women’s
Branch British Empire League. Town Hall.
September 10,7.30 p.m. Selections: Orchestra,
8 p.m. Address by President Women’s Branch.
8.15 p.m. Address by Henry Risely, Esq.,
Bristol, England. Presentation of Address
Casket and Banner from Victoria League,
Bristol, England.” This last item was the raison
d’etre of the card of invitation and the fore-
going programme. After it there was more
orchestra, some lantern-slide views of Bristol,
refreshments in the vestibule (in huge
black letters—in fact, the refreshments were
starred) and “ God Save the King.” But the
lustrous and illustrious audience was brought
together bv Mrs. Hugh Dixson and Mrs. Rutter
for the purpose of seeing the banner—“worked by
the dear Duchess of Beaufort,” to quote the
bringer, Mr, Risely handed over to the
W.8.8.E.L. The “dear Duchess’s” husband is
High Steward of Bristol, and dear Mr. Risely is
out here for the Chamber of Commerce Congress.
Incidentally he brought the banner with the
strange device with him. He is a benevolent-
looking, stately old gentleman, and undoubtedly
sound on the Kingship and the Reformed religion.
You have heard of the physician who found a
person’s creed in his or her biliary duct? If theie
was disease in the liver the person became a
Calvinist; if the organ was sound, he be-
came a Unitarian. Well, the Women’s Branch
of the B.E.L. thinks that if you are sound all
through you’ll become an Imperialist and culti-
vate the giving and receiving of banners and flags.
I wonder how Mrs. Hugh Dixson resists the in-
clination to frock herself in an Empire gown made
of silk Union Jacks draped with a Royal Standard.
Anyhow, the lady is hereby entreated to cease
screwing her hair.back with a winch and fastening
it with a clamp) She has a lot of hair, and
if she would let half of it out of the
clamp and get the Marcel wave into it,
she’a certainly'be referred to as “Dear Mrs.
Dixson,” for she has a most attractive presence
and voice. ' The Allen Taylor mayoress, Miss
Va garet Harris, Mrs. Rutter and" other elect
of the Imperialists, male and female, sat under
the over-seas banner; and planted on the outposts
of the platform were veterans left over from the
Indian Mutiny, the Crimean unpleasantness and
the Maori war. These men had reached some
terrifying ages, but they mostly looked 20 years
younger than the periods they claimed.
The Rev. Stephen O'.Breznan Ball was married
to Miss Lee, daughter of Hon. George Lee, of
Leeholme, near Bathurst, last week. The event
occurred in the old Kelso Church, where the
bride’s family have worshipped since the begin-
ning of things Bathurstian.
The military and managerial Ramaciotti having
gone up one—he is now Lieutenant-Colonel—
partly acknowledged the fusillade of congratula-
tions fired at him by giving a luncheon to the 2nd
Australian Infantry Regiment in the drill hall of
Victoria Barracks on Saturday last. I haven’t
seen the menu, but I wouldn’t be surprised to hear
that there were meringues. Personally, I believe
I would stray* on to the primrose path of un-
punctuality, procrastination and even untidiness if
meringues were the lure offered.
What would happen to a Mayor of Sydney who
had a wife who didn’t like work, and who wouldn’t
do what she didn’t like ? Probably he would be
“fired.” More probably he would never get
to the stage of wearing the necklace of plaques
and belt buckles known as his “chain of office.”
The chief citizeness has no leisure to acquire the
equivalent of moss on the brain. But the lady out
of the billet looks fresher than when she was in
it—Mrs. Tom Hughes, for instance. And if the
chief citizeness doesn’t like work, you may be
sorrier for her than for the pussy who has
to catch her own fish or starve. This
maunder is suggested by “intimations” in the
daily press of the Mayoress’s engagements for
some weeks past and for the week to come. It
seems very like hard labor without a just allow-
ance of time for sleep and food and visits to the
dressmaker. Well, as a poet says, “ O prayer and
labor, ye are one.”
On Tuesday, as one item in the general rush,
Mrs. Allen Taylor was booked to entertain the
ladies who accompanied the Chamber of Com-
merce delegates. She was to receive at the Town
Hall and give a number of Sydneysiders the
opportunity of meeting the visitors. The Spicers
—Albert, Lady and a son and daughter Spicer—
are at Mrs. Orr’s, in Macleay-street; the Ander-
sons, of Kimberley (the South African K.), and
Messrs. Hixson, Risely, and Mr. and Mrs, Harold
Cockshott are at the Australia. The Spicer
potentate, who is president of the London Cham-
ber of Commerce, was here a good many years ago
with Dr. Dale, a well-known Congregationalist
minister, on some missionary business. “Who’s
Who” credits him with three so'ns and eight
daughters. He is connected with numerous
charitable institutions, and has vaults of coin.
Butas a present-day humorist remarked, “eye
glass cords and doing good run away with a fear-
ful lot of money.” Chamber of Commerce Knox,
of Melbourne, and Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Raleigh
of the same rainy capital, are also at the Australia.
Talking of the rain which doesn’t rail unless it
pours : Ada Crossley mentions in a letter to a
friend that all June and July wetness
the heavens upon London. All fear of draught
was dissipated. The contralto’s two little? Aus-
tralian cockatoos shivered bitterly in their new
home. But with August came sun and compara-
tive warmth, and the singer and her birds revelled
in both. Dr. Mueeke has an appointment at the
London Hospital, and is up to his neck in work.
His altitude is something uncommon, so the
quantity of work must be considerable. As for
Mrs. Ada Mueeke, she is in a maelstrom of pro-
fessional engagements, following on a fortnight of
“ welcome back ” dinners, teas and receptions.
Dr. Richard Arthur, since his return from his trip
to foreign parts, has lived for twq days the Simple
Life. That is to say, he had done the first two
days of it when he wrote an unappreciation of it
to a Sunday paper. He had as companion another
man who acted as groom and gardener,, the doctor
being cook and domestic economist. Now lie
understands why the “general” flees from ser-
vice and betakes herself to the factory. “Cook-
ing,” he asserts, “may be tribulation and
vexation of spirit, but washing-up is the very
Devil.” He did not greatly mind the teacups
but the things in which he made an omelet were
cemented together with the mixture of eggs, milk
and pepper, so he hid the most sticky pieces in a
dark corner to take their chance from the next
user. That way of disposing of incriminating
evidence is ingenious. It is like leaving “ the
body ” in the front garden.
Mrs. Philip Morton is out under the spring
sunshine, after an autumn and a winter’s seclusion
through serious illness. She was at Norman
Lindsay’s picture show looking mostly eyes and
filmy black draperies.
A number of outsiders who suffered from the
hallucination that the National Council of Women
meeting held at Oranbrook last week was open to
all comers, ran down there and stuck their heads
in. Lady Clielmsford was courteous and ex-
planatory, and no dogs were set on to the tres-
passers.
Mr. “ Jim ” Osborne and his wife, who was
Miss Maud Jeffries, have rented a flat at Cromer
for the racing season. Every visitor to Sydney
who gets a chance takes a flat these days. Flats
are more comfortable than hotels, the food is
better, and the forces which operate to raise hotel-
tariffs (the march of .Socialism, the bane of Pro-
tection, the fleeing of capital from the country,
etc.) don’t appear to affect flats. At the time of
writing there is said not to be a flat the size of a
hen-mansion available for the next two months
within miles of Macquarie-street.
Colonel Mackenzie, ex-Military Commandant in
Tasmania,* is back in Sydney with his wife. He
married a Suttor (sister of him who in youth was
known, by the cognomen of “Calves” Suttor), and
was an'inhabitant of Victoria Barracks a decade
ago.
Mrs. Hordern, widow of the deceased Mr.
Samuel Hordern, departed for Europe last week,
accompanied by Major and Mrs. W. Watson, her
son-in-law and daughter.
Misses Ethel and Dorothy Plomley, of Manly,
daughters of the solicitor of the name and grand-
daughters of the late Prof. Pell, of Sydney Uni.,
are announced as about to suffer from a rush of
orange blossom to the head. Happy man No. I.
is a doctor practising here. No. 11. is of the
Royal Navy Reserve.
Mr. and Mrs. M. Meagher have issued invita-
tions fora lunch of greeting to Amy Castles. It
is to transpire at the Australia on the day this
epistle faces the world—which, by the way, is the
day the adorable Amy faces Sydney for the first
time on her present concert tour. The Cardinal
has signified his intention of being present; also
Lord Richard Nevill, the T. H. Kellys, the ex-
Lord Mayor Hughes, Dr. Graham and other
notabilities.
A photograph of a remarkably clever and pretty
child tops the pile of vagrom accumulation on uiv
desk. The bit of Brisbane newspaper adhering
to the picture mentions that the original is Miss
Yvonne Deschamps, a young Queenslander from
Cairns in the Far North where it is said
the white person is a failure. She has
just passed the senior Trinity College ex-
amination (music) with honors. She got
through the preparatory, which includes the
playing of scales and exercises and a simple
classical piece, at five years of age, and now she is
but eight. If this youngster continues to progress
at her present rate she will beat the heavenly
choirs before she is 15.
Miss Maud Grantham, a damsel with a large
quantity of fair hair and an astonishing memory
recited Tennyson’s “Enoch Arden,” at the Pianola
Hall last week, to a fair-sized and more than
fairly appreciative audience. The accompaniment
of the American composer (Strauss) was played by
MissF. Sherlock, who, with the reciter, helped to
make an artistic success of the experiment.
Miss Cissie Loftus, the girl—she’s a very
grown-up girl by now—whose wondrous imi-
tations, and air of divine, nun-like innocence
used to make American and English youth
quite abject, has married a Chicago medical man
—one Waterman—practising in London. The
hasty man from the Hurried Land proposed to
Miss Loftus over a long-distance telephone. This
is Miss Loftus’s second matrimonial essay. Her
first husband, from whom she parted more in
sorrow than in anger, was Justin Huntley
M‘Carthy, jun.

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture of the most desirable Motor Tyres and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,’ and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to he certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 13, 1909.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The-Asches in “ As You Like It ” on Saturday
were as anyone would like it, full of color and
graceful posing. But the piece scarcely had the
overpowering effect of the two previous revivals,
probably because the godhead is subdued to a
monotone in a minor key. The dominant Asche
plays Jaques, while the juicily fat part drops to
Lily Bray ton, who carries it through in a gently
picturesque fashion to the duet of the most
Anglish lan Penny, a gentleman with rather too
many padding bumps to his hero-figure.
Orlando’s wrestling scene brings out a crop
of Court ladies that are a joy in this fashion-
thirsty world. Hats ! Even the most freakily-
fashionable milliner’s special spring show
only had a thrippeny seat in the pit by
comparison with these. The tallest screecher
consisted apparently of the conical trumpet of a
concert phonograph, from which depended the
latest thing in scarves. Another was made of the
horns of a wild-eyed Lincoln cow, big and curved ;
these trifles were handsomely gilt and bound in
pearls. Another margravine or marchioness
covered her head with her best lace traycloth
spread on a Japonica bush. Two other important
dames (gaud mayoresses, I think they were)
began by swathing their hair in a novice’s cowl ;
then, gilding a policeman’s helmet apiece, they
put that atop. My dazzled sight refused to take
in the dresses—it was subconsciously picking out a
winner for a Cup hat.
Yet Rosalind Bray ton’s dress could not escape
—it was yellow ; pale, unhappy yellow. Her hat
was a crown, and her thickly-plaited copper-red
locks were bound with linen swathings. Orlando
wore his wrestling blouse daringly cut to a very
low Y. Fair little Elfrida Clement disguised
herself almost beyond recognition, in a most
blackly-black wig, as Celia.
The Forest of Arden was quite Australian.
I’m sure they were White Gums in the middle
distance, and the foreground was unfeignedly
Macedon. Fact of the matter, the ferns and
under-scrub were brought bodily down from the
vicinity of the State Governor’s mountain crib.
Thescentof forest and fresh-dugearth floated out to
the audience. And Rosalind broke away, too, from
the customary russet dress. A witiey purple was her
hat, and a faded orange-red her tunic scarf. Dwell-
ing in the woods caused necessary alterations, and
the lady appeared later in sheepskins sewed
together, with pendant lambs’ tails and a scarf of
scarlet. Celia bound a two-tooth’s coat round her
raggedy brown duds, and wore a poke bonnet of
goat,skin. Orlando, however, put his pants into
a press every night, and carefully brushed his coat
every day, so he managed' to keep his original suit
quite respectable.
These As-you-like-its go out of the usual way,
and show the cottage—a thatched rural nook,
with real smoke, puffing out of its Peter Pan
chimney. The cottage proves a convincing back-
ground for the last act. Ganymede is able to go
in the doorway, and reappear in a manner open to
human understanding as a skirt-clad Rosalind. The
d ress is a beauteous blue soft thing—quite obviously
a house gown, brought for feminine luxuriousness
in the pack-bags that try the patience of the fool.
It s an improvement on the usual Rosalind girl,
who has a habit of appearing suddenly in a white
jewelled frock on a blasted heath, with only the
stage wings to account for the transformation.
The cute blue gown hangs with a wealth of fold
over a green “petty ” that shows when the bride
dances. Some apple-blossom in her hair and in
her arms makes a rural ornamentation. To the
dance comes a village-full of rustics, who
materialise out of the wilds, of an uninhabited
forest. But it makes an effective ballet.
The Saturday night house was the kind decreed
by custom for First Nights. Governor Carmichael
bespoke a box, and came along with his lady in
black, with a bird flying,out of her hair. With
them was a very young daughter, with smooth
brow and large placid eyes, who has ventured to
have her hair coiled up. A blue-iapelled gentle-
man-help lightened the gloom of the black-and-
white symphony. The Grimwades, in a careful
row of assorted couples, lined the wide box oppo-
site.; Men by the half-dozen, looking as if, they
should remark “Caw,” selfishly sat in the south
box—nary a girl to their party. White-bearded
J. C. Stewart , and various other learned Shak-
pearian ones who rarely patronise the frivolity of a
theatre, made impressive points in the circle.
This night, like every other one, the gallery was
filled with enthusiasts. They arrive in battalions
before four o’clock, clasping a pie in one hand and a
book of the words in the other. Then they wait
for the eight o’clock show, and supply more enthusi-
asm than any other part of the house. A delighted
management has got into the hospitable way of
doling out billies of tea. Bring your own mugs !
Melba arrived in Melbourne by one express just
as Amy Castles dashed off to Adelaide in another.
Melba “lay low” in this i-eception-loving town
for a few days, then departed for Geelong—the
City of Rest—whence presently she “specials” to
Ballarat. She is getting all her engagements off
her mind by October, so that she may not have
the weighty thoughts of a concert to dog her
doings ®! Cup time.
The unconscious humorists of the Women’s
National League are bemoaning the fact that
Dame Staughton’s services will be lost to the
Great Cause for some time. Mrs. Staughton is
senior vice-president, and had been regarded as
the coming president for the year which begins
this month. But the Tory dame has a jaunt to
England in view ; and, lest she might be suspected
of sacrificing duty to pleasure, her medical adviser
haslodged a protest againt the idea of her under-
taking to preside over the League of Ladies in
these stormy times. A land-tax something
wicked in the way of impositions—is threatened,
and the League has got to make stupendous efforts
to preserve the country from ruin. Dame Staugh-
ton—with London calling for her —doesn’t feel
equal to organising the effort.
Our own Titlieradge, who acted as judge at last
week’s Melbourne daffodil show, says that our
blooms are unrivalled in the world. At the open-
ing the Governor’s Lady, in a tricky tri-cornered
hat, talked daffodils to a big gathering of enthu-
siasts. It was a rattling good speech—good even
to men who knew the subject from beginning to
end. She told them about the beauty of masses
growing naturally in English meadows and near
the snow line on the slopes of the French-Spanish
Pyrenees. This idea, the Carmichael Lady
suggested, might be extended in Australia.
His Ex. was also present at the show, but he didn’t
speak. He simply sat back and beamed with
admiration at the way his bettey half tackled her
subject. “Tniay not be much of a speaker,” he
seemed to be saying, “but what do you think of
the family ? ”
It was the finest daffodil display ever seen in
Melbourne. Judge Moule was prouder of a dozen
or so seedlings raised in his Brighton garden than
he would be if Chief Justice Madden resigned
his robes in his favor. The newly-elected
Mayor of Geelong, W. H. Higgins, was
close up for the big championship prize,
which was won by Solicitor Leonard Buckland,
of Camperdown ; with Alister Clark, the racing
man, second. Buckland and Alister Clark, both
amateur gardeners, are raising seedling daffodils
that are going to be heard of later on, even in
Europe, the wise judges say. Which will be an-
other and most graceful form of advertising this
over-modest Commonwealth.
The average woman, as she wields a hatpin, is
a continuous marvel to mere man, who sticks his
hat on with a bang and swears On a windy day.
Whenever a woman owns a man who takes suffi-
cient interest in her to lecture her she is accus-
tomed to sit down calmly under a shower of
admonitions re the evils of stabbing herself
daily in the head. The death-roll arising from
this practice is horrible —something like one
person in a billion. Anyhow, three men —Donday,
Testro and J. A. Nott—have risen in their might
to try and put down the modern hatpin anxiety.
They have designed a stabber that is caught by
a stringed button on the other side of the hat.
The Governor Carmichael lady is wearing one—
presented by these gentlemen. It is made of gold
and is jewelled like a knight’s dagger. Pearl en-
closed in sapphires makes one knob, while the
detached button (with a spring) is emu egg-shell
set in gold and Wedgewood enamel.
After all our vile August weather, things might
have been worse. A man at Samarai, in British
Papua, writes me that up to August 25 they’d had
45 inches of wet during that month ! He was
planting rubber ; but if that sort of weather lasted
another week, he was going to give it up and
plant a row or two of lifebelts, for a change.
Even now half-a-hundred Norman Lindsay pic-
tures are in the framer’s hands, as the nucleus of
a juicy fresh salad for Melbourne’s consumption.
None of these have been on exhibition in Sydney ;
for Melbourne isn’t to get the rinds of a collection
after the other capital has had its pick. The
Melbourne show will open about September 26,
and within 48 hours it is safe to say it will have a
violent eruption of red spots.
FAMILY TROUBLES.
STRANGE LADY : “ I’ve called to see you on account
of my daughter’s little baby—the one you
christened yesterday .”
PARSON : “If you tell me the name, mum, I could
look it up.”
STRANGE LADY : “ Patricia Peary North-Pole
Johnson. We wanted to know if we could
take out Peary and put in Cook.”
For three solid months William Dyson has
definitely announced his departure for America
“in three weeks.” Now, on the very moment of
booking, he revokes, and the journey is postponed
for two months. At the end of that time Dyson
has solemnly decided to go forth and look for his
attic on the seventy-fifth floor of a Noo Yark
tenement house, after a joyous wander over Paris
and London and other European places. His
friend Lindsay will go with him to Europe ; but
whether Norman will subsequently- look in on
Cousin Jonathan is a matter that the pair haven’t
yet tossed to decide.
Blamire Young is having a picture show too.
His friends bombarded his modesty until they
carried the fortress, and now he lets the world see
that he can do something besides poster-ise. Really
he only poster-ised because he had the nous to
bend his strong originality in that direction into a
hook to fish up nice shining dollars. The exhibi-
tion in the Arts and Crafts rooms this fortnight
proclaim that his color is living, virulent,
overwhelming. His line is at fault everywhere—
he is no draughtsman. But his color makes one
forgive his line. Even a washerlady down at a
stream has risen above her prosaic labor into a
world of melodious color. She is foolishly wash-
ing the “whites” with the “coloreds,” and
there’ll be an awful row when it comes to
the ironing, and a nightie is blurred from the
blue of a cambric ; but in the meantime she
is a beauteous creature to adorn a wall. A
painting looked on favorably by critical eyes is
“The Silver Dish,” wherein a supercilious girl,
aggressively and obviously wealthy, leans on a
table, with a gorgeous silver platter in the middle
distance, and copper and rich drapings hitting up
the background. People who know such values
intimately speak of it as a fine thing, with “gal-
lery” possibilities. But most of the work looks
more appetisingly decorative for the walls of a
room than for the clubbed line of a gallery.
By this week’s mail arrives a tier of Madelaipe
McEacharn’s wedding cake; and Grandma
Watson and Mrs. Hall are to see to its distribu-
tion, which is a solemn and important business.
Place aux dames / The new city watch-house
was lately opened, and one of my own fair sex
was the first to enter its portals —in a business
manner of speaking. But my sex never does
appreciate its privileges. Instead of going in like
a proud woman, she tripped her escort at the
entrance, and after that, when help was whistled
up, she simply had to be dragged in.
Some more snapshots from the damp metro-
polis :
Mrs. Wesley Hall, much improved in health, is seen
about with her pretty daughter and two sisters. Mattie
Dempster is still assiduously cultivating her Australian
high 0, and her Titian.hair makes a grateful spot of color
in this land of grey skies. Gebrge Ghirnside takes the
air in the parks, and whiffs a tireless cigarette whilst his
dame haunts Regent-street for the latest thing in chiffons.
She wears a tired look and rather more avoirdupois than
when she left Melbourne. Dr. Murray Morton, the dandy
medico of Melbourne, skips over the globe in neat patent-
leathers, and pursues more alphabet to hang on the brass
plate in front of his medical wigwam. His small, neat
mate accompanies him on his hunting' trip, and cheers
him up when game is scarce.
A few of the men Australians now in these parts dine
occasionally at the fiat of a pretty little lady, the strap-
ping of whose foot made considerable trouble in Mel-
bourne in the adjacent past. The portrait of the medical
and insolvent co-respondent hangs in a prominent posi-
tion on the wall, and the poor heroine looks at it pen-
sively when there is a pause in the conversation and the
Past yawns. The Argus Cunninghams have been staying
with Mrs. Lachlan McKinnon’s relatives in Scotland, and
doing a lot of sight-seeing. I had a good long look at the
Prime Minister’s wife the other day. She is interesting
partly because she is Mrs. Asquith, and partly because of
that injudicious exhibition of Paris costumes. There is
nothing icily English about the little lady. She chatters to
a running accompaniment of nods and smiles, and some-
times when she is talking at full speed, she unaffectedly
buttonholes her cavalier or seizes the front of his coat.
A nervous, vivacious, virile little body, she probably
organised the unfortunate frock exhibition in an over-
flow of enthusiasm, never dreaming that a storm of
criticism would burst over her head ; her astonishment
at the deluge must have been akin to that of the sparrow
that chirped and started the avalanche. The fussy L. n.
Lewis pair have set down their Saratoga in London for a
spell. He has brought his famous moustaches and she
her favorite Shakspeare editions-de-luxe, They form
themselves into a reception committee of two whenever
any of the fraternity of Collins-street appear on the
horizon ; consequently their friends in this far land are
many. The long, athletic figure of Mrs. Maudsley is to be
seen wherever the Southerners foregather ; but the shops
of this clothes-mad village have no attractions for her, and
she is usually to be found on the golf links hitting a small
ball an immense distance with a club, and then walking
after it with the deliberate intention of smiting it again
as soon as the caddie can find it. Just one more medical
item. (I begin to think lam compiling a medical direc-
tory !) Dr. Syme is mixing physics and literature, and
so far has exhibited no dangerous symptoms. Aeroplane
earrings or Bleriot pendants are the latest feminine
craze hereabouts. Dreadnoughts in the form of charms
are another fad of the hour.
Owen Cox, of the Sydney shipping world, has been
doing Fogtown with any amount of dash. He takes back
with him one of the latest petrol fliers to scatter the dust
of Pitt-street, and he has risked the displeasure of the
Law by his astonishing pace over the excessively doggy
London roads. It has become the fashion for wealthy
motorists to subscribe a certain number of dogs per year
for the purpose of stocking the roads.' This is an adapta-
tion of the preserve idea. The sport, of course, consists
in dodging the anguished hound as he sprints for safety.
The supply of dogs was almost exhausted when someone
hit on this schem e.
From “Rosna,” of Adelatde :
Weather for once was all that it ought to be in Heaven
for the Saturday events of the S. A.J.O. Spring Meeting at
Morphettville. The course wore its best flowers, and
Sassiety its new spring garment. Their Exes, were there ;
Lady Bosanquet was in a mauve frock and millinery,
while the twins were pink-clad, with rose-wreathed
crowning giories. Roses also flanked the vice-regal box,
and nodded familiarly at its occupants.
Last week was thickly spread with Castles concerts.
The management began with three ; then it tacked on a
matinee, and finally added another evening outburst. At
the first concert, the cautious people of this village left a
vacant seat or six ; but after that, being assured of their
money’s worth, they left nothing but breathing room.
For some strange reason, Adelaide dropped its floral
habit, and never a bloom did it hand to Amy. Our own
Peter Dawson had a great welcome. He was required to
sing at least twice, and bend himself in the middle at
least 12 times, after each programmed item. His ex-
preceptor, Mr. 0. J. Stevens, accompanied him, looking
prouder than the hero himself. Miss Cattles gave this
pious village a sight of some very directoire chiffons—one
a rose-pink shimmery creation, intensely plain and un-
bejewelled ; another, white and silver and luminous and
charming. Their Excellencies went to one concert, but
for the most part it was not society that spent its
shillings, but the plain, enthusiastic music-loving masses.
The District Trained Nurses’ Association will go out
into the highways on September 16 to coax the scarce
coin from unwary citizens. It is an excellent charity, so
let’s hope there will be less furtive traffic in the back lanes
than there usually is when the street collector is abroad
in the land.
The mayoral Johnsons are having their garden party
on October 23, when Victoria Park will "be wearing its
best spring flowers, instead of waiting- for a November
sun to frizzle up the guests.
Mary Roach, one of Adelaide’s jolly fiddlers and singer
girls, has been treating Fiji to a concert. She went off a
month or so ago for a jaunt round the South Sea Isles,
and letters to hand announce that she was to play and
sing at Suva on September 8, much to the apparent joy
of the gentlemen who wear doormats on their backs.
The Bach Society is tuning up to sing us the “ Dream
of Gerontius.” The classical thing will be performed at
two matinOeson October 2 and 9, this city having run out
of halls for evening performances at the moment.
There was a home-made musical evening at the Lyric
Club last week. The programme consisted wholly of
songs, soli and other mysteries that had been grown in
the State, and carefully watered every morning and
weeded once a week. Taking it all round we are all quite
sure no other corner of the globe could have done better.
There were three dramatic songiets by Angelita Davis, a
young Mus. Bac., and three very charming and soulful
ditto by Jeannie Ridgway, also Mus. Bac. The Frederick
Bevans’ son contributed three tuneful ballads and a brace
of quartettes ; and a daughter of Speaker Coles provided
two ditties about butterflies and roses. The only instru-
mental item was a piano solo by Sylvia Whitington.
The youngest Plummer maiden, Muriel, was married to
her benedict, Mr. Schofield, at St. John’s, on Tuesday.
It was a very quiet business. Professor Watson (who is
the chief University authority on how to plant brains and
graft new limbs) asked Mr. Schofield to accept Miss
Plummer with his love, or something similar ; and a
prettily-garbed Plummer sister and a tall young medico
brother nodded their approval. After the ceremony, the
pair went off at once, while the rest of the party consoled
itself with melody at the Town Hall.
J. R. Wilton, the brilliant Adelaide youth who has been
collect! ng triposes and such-like dignities at Cambridge for
five years, has just been appointed Lecturer in Mathe-
matics at the University of Sheffield. He coursed through
our ’Varsity, capturing the only first-class honors in both
physics and mathematics that the authorities have ever
been able to spare. Then he went to Cambridge, and
promptly became fifth wrangler. Then he galloped
through the Natural Science tripos, with first-class honors
in Physics, and finally annexed the title of Major Scholar
of Trinity College, while a proud papa Wilton stayed at
home and continued to write paragraphs and things for
the Adelaide Advertiser.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
London will shortly make a splash with “The Pal-
ladium,” the largest variety house in the world. The new
hall will seat over 4000 persons in a lOOft.-wide audi-
torium, divided into a ground floor exclusively for stalls
and armchairs, and a huge family circle displacing the
usual gallery. The new enterprise is mainly due to
Walter Gibbons, of the London Theatre of Varieties, and
is expected to be in full cash-taking order early in 1910.

anxmus to dish Parkes tempted Joseph with port-
fol'° of P.M.G., and he took R kmdly and e j
and other portfolios for five years. But things happened,
and Lyne and See came into power. When Federal on was
established, the See Government looked too firmly fixed
to give Joseph any hope of a return to State office, so he
reached for a Federal , position. He calculated
defeat of the Barton Ministry at the polls. As a faithful
follower of G. H. Reid, he secured a seat in the O
wealth Parliament; but he was doomed to sir. in PP '
tion. The second appeal to the people left G. H.
Joseph still in the cold. An accident happened, and Reid
fid McLean formed a fugitive Government that got like
lightning into recess. But Reid included Pumpkin Smith
and Dugald Thomson, and excluded Joseph. Befoie
re-assembling, Deakin gave Reid-McLean notice of

FIVE STOMACH WORMS
Passed bt a Child One Yeak and Ten
Months Old.
“For six months,” states Mrs. C. A. Madden,
of Kurrajong, N.S.W., “my little boy, now aged
one year and ten months has suffered from
stomach worms, which the doctor attributed to
the use of impure water. Until he was sixteen
months old he enjoyed very good health, but sub-
sequently he became very irritable and cross, and
later on he was examined by a doctor who
stated that the cause was stomach worms. Vari-
ous treatments were tried, and on one occasion a
stomach worm was passed from the bowels. The
evacuations from the bowels were always stained
with blood, and the motions were quite unnatural.
On three or four occasions the child was almost
choked and went into convulsions and almost black
in the face through the worms passing up to the
throat, and I had to force my finger down the
throat to remove the worms.
“ Only last week I was strongly advised to try
Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets, and
having obtained a box I gave the child a dose in
accordance with the instructions, and the same
evening five worms varying in length, the longest
being 15 inches in length, were expelled.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
■obtainable at all chemists and stores, or will be
forwarded by post (postage paid) on receipt of
remittance. Price Is. Gd. per box (6 boxes Bs. 6d).

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Wallabies have wiped out their early defeat
hy the Kangaroos with a vengeance. Wednesday saw
the strong heavy team mop the floor with the fast light
team by 34 to 21 ; and on Saturday they repeated the
dose on a smaller scale, winning by 15 points to six.
The Wallabies had mastered the game, and when they
piled their surplus brawn and muscle on to the struggling
Kangs, the latter animals became demoralised. In the
first match, the Wallabies missed chances. Wednesday
and Saturday they' missed nothing—took all they could
get and came along cheerfully for more. Of course, the
sweat was hardly dry on the players when another match
was mentioned; which was what everybody expected.
Thev had tasted blood—and cash.
m * * *
In the Australian Rules division, Newtown
played North Shore at Erskineville oval, and went under
by nine points. But it is pleasing to notice that its
game was not only better but cleaner, and the club gave
ample demonstration that it knows how to play properly
when it likes. Had it liked all through the season, it
would probably have been higher on the poll. For once
at least it played the ball and hot the man, and when the
struggle was over went in and complimented the referee
on his work —usually' it, or some of it, waits for the
referee and throws words at him. Evidently it is
heeding the wisdom of its secretary', J. ‘Phelan, who
has stuck to it through good and evil report for some
years now'. Paddington went down to Y.M.0.A., the
Good Young Men running out with 125 points to 54. Late
captain Matthews made his reappearance with the
Y.M.0.A., and provided much good play'. Saturday’s
upheaval makes North Shore’s position at the top of the
poll beyond overtaking. It has now' 56 competition
points to the 48 of its runners-up, Y.M.O.A. and Padding-
ton. New'town is 32.

The Soccer crowd will play off the final of the
Gardiner Cup at Sy'dney Cricket Ground on Saturday
next, when the contending teams will be Adamstown and
Pvrmont, the winners of the Rawson Cup and the Com-
petition. The Pyrmont cup of joy will be spouting like a
fountain if the club pulls off the two big Soccer trophies.
The only gnat in the liquid will be the dark memory of
that unexpected defeat by Granville. Adamstown is the
premier club of the North Coast districts.

Whatever else they can do in the Hunter River
district of N.S.W., Rugby is not one of the local accom-
plishments ; and the team that came down to Sydney to
play the final match of the Union’s season against South
Sydney got fairly eaten up. It was a dreary game,
played to what the show'man describes as “a beggarly
array ” ; and in the end South Sydney won easily with 16
points to three. It could not have been less, and it
might easily have been a lot more. It was a dying kick,
and it looked like it.

After all, Sydney University hoof-ballers were
not disgraced by that awful doing at Dunedin, when they
went down with three to 22. When they reached
Dunedin rain had been falling in floods for the best part
of a week, and the ground was more like a duck pond
than a football field. After the first spell of mud-polo
Dunedin ’Varsity was leading by eight to three, and the
wild Scotsmen of thp South reckoned it was all
over barring the drinks. But the Sydney crowd pulled
itself together; the forwards went baresark, and the
backs played like a machine. The mud flew in
showers, and when it was wiped off the scoring board at
the end of the match it was found that Sydney had won
by IT to eight. Then the Rugby lunatics of the Scotch
metropolis worked the “ Metropolitan ” trick, just as was
done in Sydney against the Ponsonbv team. Dunedin’s
Metropolitan team is practically the Otago rep. team, one
and indivisible. The Sydney captain looked at the awful
coihbination arrayed against his side and addressed his
men “Gentlemen, victory is impossible ;it but remains
to show how well the Sydney ’Varsity can die.” And it
died well—by 22 to three.

The N.S. W. Rugby Union’s luck is out. First,
the Welsh team', which proposed to visit Australia next
year, has fallen through its engagement; and now' the
South African Rugby Board has also declined an invitation
to tour Australia and Maoriland. Added to the passing over
of the Wallabies, these things have not put the Rugby
Union in an amiable frame of mind.
Saturday’s hoofball in Melbourne—they are be-
ginning to spell i t’oofball—was a matter of semi-finals,
packed houses and poor games. Some 40,000 squeezed
on to the Metropolitan Cricket Ground, and at Is. and
2s. 6d. per head should have been worth £3OOO odd ; but
the 4800 M.C.C. members and their lady friends filled
most of the stands, so the “gate” panned out at only
£l3OO. As a curtain-raiser, Beverley and South Yarra
battled for the Metrop. Ass. pennant, and Souths came
out on top by 46 points to 25. Then Carlton and Essen-
don bogged in to discover which was to get into the final.
For the first quarter the play w'as open, and so fast that
it foretold a dragging finish. By the second term the teams
bad slow'ed dowm a trifle, and it was a clever, well-
planned set-to up to half-time—Carlton, 46 points;
Essendon, 31. On resuming, a strenuous and sustained
rally by the ’Dons would have given the public the joy of
a close finish, but the rally came from the Old Bluesin-
stead, and before lemon time they were six goals ahead.
Thence to theclose the “ Same Old ” battled gamely but
hopelessly against better marking, cleaner handling and
superior combination, and wound-up 36 dreadful points
in default —Carlton, 14 goals eight behinds ; ’Don, nine
goals two behinds. But it was too like the Johnson-Burns
collision for real in terest; Carlton was on an average 201 b.
a man heavier, and the weight told.
In pursuance of its present policy the Argus
spread itself over the semi-final, and gave the heights,
weights and occupations of the combatants. It appears
that no less than seven of Carlton’s eighteen ’bailers are
tea-graders. As no other team boasts any undue pre-
ponderance of gentlemen following that learned profes-
sion, it would appear that some firm of tea-blenders can
always find an opening for a good ’bailer as long as he
plays for Carlton. Which is a suggestive circumstance.
On the North Melbourne ground last year’s
Ass. premiers (’Scra.v) strove to force their way into the
final by bumping Essendon out, and failed dismall}',
never having a hope after the first quarter, and falling to
pieces utterly in the last. Essendon’s tally when the
bell rang was 79 to ’Scra.v’s 37. For this disaster
’Scray has to thank the short-pass system of the
men from the Tramway suburb ; its marking was
as good, its kicking 1 superior; but it hadn’t brains
enough to grasp the folly of punting with regular and
painful persistence dead against a high wind. ’Scray will
n«w retire for seven months to cogitate over this and
other little discrepancies. During the week P’ran’s
committee pondered over sundry rumors and allegations
about its players in the Brunswick semi-final, and heaved
four out of its ranks. Unless the Ass. grants re-
prieves, the four are thereby disqualified for the rest of
their days.

The Melbourne Junior Ass. semi-final, at Rich-
mond City Reserve, was chiefly notable because three
afternoons’ sport was crowded into one. First Carlton
and North Melbourne fought out their postponed battle ;
then a one-armed motor-cyclist attempted to lower the
three-mile paced record; lastly Yarraville and Port
Juniors scuffled for the right of entry to the final, while
in between times eight heats of the inter-club Wheel
Race were put through, among the entries being Gas-
coyne, Finlay, McDonald and H. Thomas. Thus does an
Austral winner come to be a side-show to a third-rate
football scuffle. (Yarraville bumped out Port Juniors by
44 points to 16, though that doesn’t really matter.)

Word comes from Adelaide, of all places, of an
importation that had better been left in ’Murka. This is
the practice of persuading jaded athletes to inhale oxygen
—“doping,” as it is called in the wooden ham land. Some
lacrossers remembered tales narrated by the Canadian
ruffians who swept across the Commonwealth last year ;
so the Norwood footballers started tinkering with the
idea, and on September 4 got a city dentist to pump the
gas into 10 of the weariest’bailers at half-time. Afterwards
the spring in their movements and their obvious freshness
crumpled up their opponents ; so more of it is to be done.
The sooner the committee which does these things is
passed out the better. The sole advantage to be gained
by this doping is the winning of two or three games ; its
disadvantages include taking a day, perhaps a week,
perhaps a month, off a man’s life ; it eventually leaves
him a wreck ; it tends to rob him of self-respect; it is
bringing a healthy, useful exercise down to the level of
dog-racing ; it will, if continued, kill the game deader
than J. Caesar ; and, finally, it isn’t sport.

With Union Rugby dead, movements among
the sailing fraternity, and the opening of the Stadium, it
is evident that summer is coming in Sydney. Mclntosh’s
arena will open on the evening of Wednesday, the 22nd,
with a scrap between Frank Thorn, of Melbourne, and
Arthur Douglas, of S. Africa.

The Kingdom of Bowling is under a new
monarch, and the well-known and genial Mr. George
Raffan sits in the seat of supreme authority. His vice-
presidents are Mr. Aleck Louden, “choir-master,’’and the
retiring secretary, Mr. Wbitehouse. Two former Y.P.’s,
Messrs. Crouch and Denver, were re-elected. Mr. Raffan
should make a good president: he is an experienced
and reliable bowler; a man who has made several trips
round the world, and written and published accounts of
his travels in book form ; and he owns three motors-cars
with which to bring the bowlers into closer communion.
His first administrative problem will be to devise some
method of reasonably-accelerated death in the pennant
competitions. The members object to too-sudden death,
and the problem of what constitutes reasonably-accele-
rated decease is a delicate one.

The English National Airship League, formed
to present the British Government with a dirigible fulfil-
ling the requirements of the War Office, has lodged its
order with the Lebaudy Frferes, of Paris, who have built
dirigibles for both the French and Russian Governments.
It is to be 328 ft. in length ; to be driven by two independ-
ent motors ; to be capable of rising 6000 ft. to get right
away from shrapnel and “flame shells”; to travel not
less than 40 miles per hour; and to be fitted with “ wire-
less ” ; and all rigid parts are to be constructed of wood.

The cheap and rapidly-spreading foolishness of
watching a “professor” risk his neck ballooning down
Sydney harbor is spoiling for a vigorous knock-out.
At Mosman, on Sunday, the descending bubble knocked
over a chimney, smashed windows, and lifted guttering
and other obstacles which wouldn’t get out of its way.
Then the earth intervened—and the balloon rested.
When a J.P., alderman, or other responsible person gets
a head shifted askew, the excitable pastime can reckon
on annihilation.

That part of England’s population that earns a
doubtful crust boat-pushing on the Thames is bellowing
to Richard Arnst to come “ home ” and see what sort of
mess they will make of him. There are world-beaters on
the Thames, they declare ; and it is the duty of Dick to
go to the Thames and meet them. Richard’s remarks
about cash are met with the explanation that honor, and
not cash, counts on the Thames; to which he replies
gruffly that he isn’t after honor. It can stay on the
Thames.
However, Arnst is likely to get another race in
Australia shortly, as the winner of the Day-Pearce con-
test will certainly challenge him. This meeting eventuates
on Saturday week; and the “old hands” are confi-
dently tipping Day as the man for Parramatta. He
is said to be a second Beach, to be the ideal long-
distance man, and to have improved right out of sight
under the skilled tuition of George Towns. His party has
all the cocksureness that goes usually before the awful
splash,-and is said to be hypothecating household pro-
perty and underwear to raise money to back its fancy.
On the other side, Pearce’s followers, whose name is
Legion, are equally ready to put up the last dollar ; and
certain it is that Pearce has also improved out of sight.
Arnst, world champion, says Pearce gave him an unmerci-
ful tussle 12 months ago, and he is apparently a better
man to-day than he was then. So, taking it all round,
there seem to be all the ingredients for a pretty struggle.

It was the deadly pitching of C. Franks which
broke up the Victorian baseball team that had such a bad
time in Sydney recently. His pace was terrific, his aim
unerring; and the astounded Victorians melted away
like butter in January sun. The first match went to the
Victorians by three runs to two ; then N.S.W. raked in
the second by eight to seven and the third by 11 to one,
and thereby grabbed the rubber.

Immediately upon arrival in England on the
way to Carlsbad, James Jeffries denied that he had signed
any articles to fight brudder Johnson, but assured the
interviewer that, all the same, he would fight him,
sooner, later or sometime : “It may be in six months’
time —it may be before that; or it may be later ; but it
will certainly happen unless one or other of us dies.”
General opinion seems to be that one or other of them
will die before that momentous scrap comes off.
* * * *
Before the fight, according to the cable, Johnson
was favorite at 10 to four ; but Kaufman’s supporters
contented themselves with laying two to one that A 1
would be on his feet at the end of the 10 rounds. John-
son was hooted on entering the ring, while Kaufman was
greeted with cheers. Kaufman appears to have been
wretchedly slow, quite unable to keep away from the
champion or get close enough to him to land
effectively. Round after round Johnson made a
chopping-block of him, and in the sixth round
knocked him clean through the ropes. But, all the
same, the black man hadn’t a knock-out blow about
him, and, in the ninth, he met a smash in the com-
missariat that made him run very wild indeed. At the
end of the exhibition, the referee stated to the news-
papers that “Johnson out-fought, out-hit and out-
generalled Kaufman all through the fight. I don’t
think that Johnson held back in the ninth round and
some of the earlier ones, but tried to finish his opponent,
Kaufman was no match for the champion.” But, as
before-mentioned, Johnson hadn’t a knock-out blow about
him.
“Gentleman Jim” Corbett, the conqueror of
Jonel Sullivan, is now appearing in an English music
hall, in evening dress, telling yarns about himself. There
are no sparring matches, boxing bouts, or anything of
the sort—merely an immaculate gentleman, in faultless
evening dress, killing old-timers with his mouth. This is
decadence.
“ Iron Man ” Joe Grimm is howling for another
fight, and for preference with Mike Williams. He offers
to put up anything from £5O to £lOO as a side bet, and to
retire from the ring if he cannot make mincemeat of
Michael. If Joseph is wise he will not seek to inflict
bodily harm on his brother Michael.

After the downfall of lan Hague, it was doubt-
ful if England possessed a decent heavyweight pug. But
Gunner Moir, who had been defeated by Hague before
Hague was defeated by the other man, declared that his
downfall was a mere fluke. So he induced “Young”
Johnson, an list. 101 b. Yankee, to come along and give
him a chance to. show that England still owned a cham-
pion. Johnson came, and the results, were hideous.
Moir proved that he could not fight for nuts, and got
donkey-licked by a man over two stone lighter than him-
self. The deed was done in sJmin., during which Moir
was mostly on the floor ; and he barely touched his
youthful antagonist.

That frayed and faded den known as “The
Gaiety,” in which Sydney’s fighting has mostly taken
place of late years, is being renovated, enlarged and im-
proved. Altogether a genuine effort is being made to
put the place into something like the shape a boxing-hall
ought to assume.

F. S. Cody, the man who was sometime ago
working on aeroplanes for the Imperial War Office, but
suddenly severed his connection with the department,
has not ceased to experiment with his appliance ; and,
on Wednesday week, he gave a great demonstration at
Aldershot, circling and manoeuvring at a height of 200 ft. 1
at a speed of 40 miles per hour for 63 minutes. It is a
curious thing that the British aerial warship, Nulli
Secundus, destroyed in a gale at Crystal Palace, has
never been replaced.

A. Pianto, who will represent Westralia in the
Warrnambool-Melbourne Dunlop race, had the distinction
of winning the double in the Beverlev-Perth road race, by
carrying off first place and fastest time. He ran over 116
miles of filthy roads, made sloppy by heavy rains, in
6hr. Omin. 30sec. The first six homers in that race rode
Dunlops, and the big Australian rubber firm is mighty
proud of it.

The Goulburn-to-Sydney Dunlop race will
eventuate on this coming Saturday, under the usual hal-
cyon conditions as to feeding, etc. No less than 160 riders
have nominated for the 131-mile spin; and some very
fast riding is expected.

Let us lift a song of rejoicing for the perform-
ance of L. Benn in the Victorian Motor Cycle Club’s 50-
mile spin Saturday week, for it is among the world’s best.
The Victorian ran 50 miles, although he had to slow down
for three turns, in lhr. smin. This was at the rate of 46
miles per hour ; and when you consider it was done over
the ordinary road, up hill and down dale, with the cattle
browsing along the track, over the beastly roads that
obtain in the paralytic shires of Victoria, it is an amazing
deed. The motor-cycle-track world record is 50 miles
in 48min. 21sec., and was put up on the splendidlv-laid
and properlv-hanked track at Los Angeles (California,
U.S.A.) last April; but as a great ride it is not in the
same cow-paddock as the Victorian’s.
* * * *
Although Empire is in the air, some of the
swimmers of England are thinking anything but imperi-
ally, and are actually prompting the Amateur Swimming
Association to disqualify Australian visitors who go to
England on money raised by subscription. The idea of
these sticklers for'pure merinoism is that to be a real
amateur a man must pay his own expenses, not out of
money given to him for that purpose, but out of his
private income, though that income may have been
equally given him by a rich pa. It means, of course, that
there will be no Australian swimmers competing in
England. To expect a man to travel 12,000 miles, and
maintain himself while he competes for pewter ware and
honorable mention is asking too much. The majority of
our athletes are young men who have to toil for their
living, and have neither wealth of their own nor rich
parents to supply it. The ideas of the agitators, if put
into practice, will make international swimming what
horseracing used to be, the sport of kings and millionaires.

N.S.W. amateur billiard championship went
into the arms of H. Rumball last week, after a fine tussle
with Mai Spencer. In the game of 1500 up, the two
players see-sawed right through, and when Rumball
eventually took the bauble he held a lead of only 42
points. The N.S.W. champion will play Victorian cham-
pion A. H. Tricks for the Australian championship at
Sydney next week.
* * * *
With a view to pocketing the golden ball, Fred
Lindrutn and George Gray will shortly wander round the
world displaying their powers at the billiard-fable. When
Gray originally said he was going to visit Bull’s country,
challenges of all description began to happen along ; but
the youngster has heaved them aside, and will make a
journey to spy out the land and get a grip before he sails
right into the trouble over the world’s championship.
* * * *
“Blackbutt” (evidently a billiard crank)
writes:—“lf figures don’t teli falsehoods, George Gray
has a better claim to the title of Australian billiard cham-
pion than Fred Lindrum. Gray, who was allowed 1000
start in a 16,000 game at Melbourne, won by 4126, and
averaged 43.48 points for every time the cue was taken
up, while Lindrum’s average stood at 34.46. Gray over-
shadowed his opponent with breaks of 836, 800, 588, 564,
534, 461, 417, 408,393, 360, 343, 326, 308, and a host of
lesser ones ; and Lindrum only once exceeded the third
century with a break of 307. Gray’s succession of big
breaks in a 16,000 game has never been approached by a
single billiardist; and therefore Gray (who is only in his
fourth year at the game) seems likely to develop into a
world-beater.”

Tatt.’s Club Meeting, at Randwick, last Satur-
day, was a full-dress rehearsal for the big A. J. C. Spring
gathering to take place within the next few weeks. The
attendance was large, and starters numerous. Triers
were few, comparatively, because many hadn’t had a
public gallop for months, and others were not far enough
advanced in their preparation ; while more are being held
back for specially-planned coups, which will probably end
as such things often do, and leave owners and trainers
lamenting that they threw away the sweet little fish.
Top weight (9st. 71b.) Parsee easily appropriated Tramway
Handicap (6 fur.) in lmin. 14jjseo. The unseasoned punter
promptly rushed away and backed him down to 10 to 1
for the Epsom ; the other chap remembered the nag was
engaged in Spring Stakes the same day. Still the ways
of owners and trainers are often inscrutable, and Parsee
may shape a hot favorite for the big mile handicap.
Those great gallopers, Irishman and the Indian-owned
Aborigine, were second and third ; Irishman did well
enough to tempt his connections to speculate largely on
engagements ahead.
* * * *
W.f.a. Chelmsford Stakes (9 fur.) attracted a
tony field, including such high-steppers as Mountain
King, Linacre, Montcalm and Lord Nolan, with Maranui,
Monobel, Artillerie, Didus and the Derby candidates,
Malt King and Prince Foote. The favorite was Patronatus
(101 b. allowance), but he was never in it till the finish,
and pulled up fifth. Prince Foote won in convincing
fashion, though the stable fancied him little, thinking he
was not far enough forward. Maorilander Artillerie
made up lots of ground near the end, and but
for that severe effort might have been a closer
second; he just beat Malt King, who also ran a great
horse. Many supported Prince Foote and other three-
year-olds, because one of that class usually succeeds in
events of the Chelmsford Stakes* nature. On his display
Prince Foote, who started at,l2 to 1 against, looks a good
thing for the A.J.C. Derby, and if he trains well should
pfive the Melbourne Cup a great shaking:; indeed, fir
and second in the Chelmsford Stakes strike the mind as
particularly hot double for the two Cups. In four start
as a two-year-old Prince Foote won Sires Produce Stakes,
was second in Champagne Stakes, and third in Rosehill
Nursery Handicap. He, Artillerie and Malt King 1 have
several big engagements ahead.

The difference in quality between the M.L.
juniper and the Sydney product. Kairoma landed a week
or two since, after running last in a jumping event at
Christchurch —possibly because he couldn’t do better.
On Saturday he started in Tatt.’s hurdles, backed
from 10 down to 5 to 1, and made all the other seven look
absolute commoners —which they perhaps were.
* * *
Silver Hampton started a red-hot favorite at
3 to 1 against for Tatt.’s Novice Stakes on Saturday, while
as long odds as 25 to 1 were laid against his stable chum,
Loki. Silver Hampton was interfered with through Tabu
following, and finished fifth, while Loki won, beating the
second favorite, Ballantrae, by a head.
* * * *
Mr. F. Merton’s four-year old Flavinius, who
had been heavily speculated upon for the Epsom mile,
gathered the Mile Welter Handicap in a capable
manner; and as he started equal favorite with Kyeadgerie
(at 4 to 1 against), and as the books lost heavily on the
race, it seems as if the stable now' stands on velvet, with
a bit to the good, over its Epsom investments. Flavinius
won easily from Kyeadgerie. There is a wide difference
between the conditions of a Welter Race and those of the
Epsom Handicap, but a champion can do no better than
win w'ith a good margin in hand ; wherefore this scribe is
inclined to give Flavinius a first-class chance, even with
Parsee, should the latter strip for the big Spring Meeting
mile.

The recent floods saved a lot of money to the
inhabitants of the Coleraine (Vic.) district. Their Sep-
tember race meeting was cancelled owing to the drowned

Just to throw shame and ridicule at Ikey Moses,
the totalisator occasionally pays mighty dividends. Last
week, in the Hannan’s Handicap at Kalgoorlie (W.A.),
Loch Shiel paid £l3B 18s. for every £1 invested. Ikey
Mo is scarcely, nowadays, guilty of offering that price
against the chance of winning a double !
Les G. Mclntosh, the 22-year-old champion
log-chopper of Sydney’s Northern Suburbs, faced veteran
giant Jim Heckenberg for the supremacy of the Com-
monwealth at Clontarf the other day. The youngster
has fine development: he stands 6ft. high, has a 42m.
chest and weighs 13st. 21b. Heckenberg (43years old) is
6ft. 2in. high,l7st. 21b. in weight, 46in. at the chest, and
shows a pair of 18|in. biceps. Mclntosh had previously
triumphed in 16 events and was only beaten once on level
terms. Heckenberg has piled up a great heap of log-
conquering honors and has been champion of the Com-
monwealth for years : be is one of several brothers, all
stalwart Liverpool (N.S.W.) natives. Mclntosh, was
nervously anxious—the anxiety of the inexperienced
boy facing the seasoned veteran, while Heck moved
round as if it were an every-day happening. The hour’s de-
lay bevond the advertised time of starting did not add to
Mclntosh’s fitness. Another weighty handicap with him
was the fact that his father had died within the previous
couple of weeks. Mclntosh chopped in a nervously
anxious way—perhaps three to the champion’s one blow
—but the big fellow’s log fell in Imin. 27sec. from the
start, while Mclntosh occupied several seconds more over
his job. Tommy Burns was referee. Conditions pro-
vided for peppermint logs. Mclntosh’s was 47Jin. and
Heckenberg’s47fin. round. Another match between the
pair for a big stake is likely.

Roval Melbourne Golf Club (which pretentious
organisation plays freely with black balls) is in the throes
of an open meeting; so Sandringham is clouded o’er
with the dust of many motors. The women, as a rule,
seem of a more certain age chan the men, who vary from
youths of the Eric Quirk cut to veterans like Frank Stuart,
who still plays a good game. Last week the men had all
the glory-light to themselves, but the amazons were
there in hundreds among the barrackers, following the
cleek swingers from green to green. There was some keen
play between Clyde Pearce and Norman Brookes, until
the tennis champion missed a short put, and Pearce got
one up, amidst shrieks of approbation. O. Felstead, who
won the Open Championship from Michael Scott, is a
very tall youth in his teens, son of Felstead of the
“Lane.” He was schooled at Hamilton College,which
has splendid links ; hence his capture of the champion-
ship. But the Hon. Michael played much below his form,
owing, it is said, to recent anxiety about his wife’s health.
This week the other sex has the links.

“X.”: Mrs. Hyde, of Stockton, who was
recently w'iped out by Miss Lewis for the Australian ladies’
sculling championship, deserves a big medal for her
pluck. She admits being in the region of her43rd year,
and the mother of 13 children. She therefore conceded
a handicap of over 20 years to her youthful rival. It
was Youth v. Age ; and, as usual, Youth won.

The Australian XI. last week bumped an
English team got together by some lord or another, and
went dOwn smash to the tune of 133 runs. It was about
the worst defeat the team has yet struck from a runs
point of view ; but. considering it had staved Off disaster
for 28 consecutive matches, no one will be wildly anxious
to heave bricks at the XI.

The United States mix sport and business in a
charming fashion. Finding that Yankee yachtsmen were
developing a habit of getting their craft builded in
England, an annual tax of 30s. per gross ton for Yankee
registration was ladled out; and now the yachtsmen are
squirming. The average price for a millionaire yacht is
about £100,000; and one sybarite who recently had
something extra-special constructed finds that it will cost
him annually one thousand dollars to keep his beauty on
the U.S.A. register. The result is that at least one
famous English yacht-builder is contemplating moving
across the herring pond, mast, rigging and hull.

“ Iyles Innison,” concerning certain
friends of John Darling :
Now that the smoke and dust have cleared away, the
big men of the late Broken Hill unpleasantness can be
sorted out. The 1909 trouble certainly did npt produce a
Dick Sleath or a Ferguson—a natural mob-leader like
Sleath happens along only once in a long while. But,
nevertheless, apart from the imported Tom Mann who
monopolised most of the limelight, three or four men stood
out in strong relief. “Billy” Barnett, the secretary of
the A.M.A. and Combined Unions, mattered consider-
ably ; but his clerical task kept him out of the fight-
ing line. “Bob” Hewitt, who “did time” for his share
in the ’92 disturbance and who has since been accused
by The Bulletin of writing verse, also figured,
and was a favorite with the crowd because he knows how
to crack a joke. The appearance of “ Bob” on the plat-
form ever made for optimism—and that’s a handy thing
to have in a big struggle. Then there was little “ Billy ”
Rosser (strange how the fighters are mostly “Billy” or
Bob or Dick—they are seldom Aubrey or Reginald). He
is a combative Welshman, and, thanks to the “ginger”
he imparted into the rumpus, only escaped the vindictive
wrath of Justice Bring by the skin of his teeth. At
one stage of the fight he was the unionists’
idol, but his stock slumped badly at the finish.
He was probably the most earnest and enthusi-
astic union campaigner on the Barrier ; but re-
cognising that an undignified defeat was inevitable'if the
battle was continued, he wanted to end it shorfejy after the
Arbitration Court’s award was given. Most of the union-
ists wanted to see hostilities ended ; .but it looked too
much like a change of front for “Billy” to hold out the
olive branch, and so his name became Mud. Another
“Billy” was Nulty, president of the A.M.A. and the
Combined Unions. No orator, and with a sublime dis-
regard for every rule of grammar, he was, nevertheless,
always impressive, mainly because he looked far into the
uncertain future before he let himself loose He came
into the fight splendidly equipped with the grim experi-
ence gained in the Broken Hill and shearers’ strikes of the
early ’nineties ; and he handled the heterogeneous union
forces with much skill. He was practically the otdy man
to come through the long and strenuous ordeal without
antagonising by turns almost every section of the union-
ists, and times out of number he patched up internal dis-
affections with a fine tact.
A cry from the West :
Joe Grimm was lucky in breaking with the Master in
Lunacy at Perth, but the said official is bearing up.
Never was an institution more happy to part with a
patient than that Westralian asylum was to shut its doors
on J. Grimm, leaving- Joseph on the outside. Joe was
possessed of a conviction that he was a perfectly sane
man, and his protests against incarceration were those of
a very powerful person in a very bad temper. On one
occasion he took possession of the asylum, lock, stock and
officers, and stated with infinite regret that he would
have to break up the happy home if his rights as a free-
born Dago were not recognised. He then assumed
forcible possession of the keys, secured his captors in a
ward and walked out, locking the asylum after him. Joe
was recovered and restored to the institution, but after
that his stay was short, and the quaint pugilist and his
captors parted without expressing any desire to meet
again.

Until you are free from the tendency to constipation you are
bound to suffer from the symptoms —torpid liver, inactive
kidneys, delicate stomach, loss of appetite, indigestion, bilious-
ness,'headache, feverishne 'S, and the rest. In your condition
Cockle’s Pills are an imperative need. They will not only

ITS A-COMINQ ON I
DON’T REMAIN BALDS
If you ara ABSOLUTELY bald, you will remain so all your life—nothing on earth will
give you back vour hair. BUT if you still have a “ down ”or light “ fluff ”on vour pate,
YOUR BALDNESS CAN BE CURED.
That “ down ” or “fluff ” is YOUNG! HAIR doing: its utmost to "row strong and vigorous on a
parched, dry and barren scalp.
Irrigate “That Bald Spot” with plentiful showers of
CAPILLA HAIR TONIC,
and as sure as grass grows after a shower of rain, so surely will that “ d >wn ” take on a new, strong
and vigorous life, and grow into long, strong and thick hair.
I positively guarantee Capilla to do all I claim for it—if it doesn't, back goes your money. If
you want a fairer or stronger hair-growing proposition than I offer, then you don’t deserve to have
a decent growth of hair.
“I have used your Hair Tonic, which speaks for itself, it having made my hair grow on
bald patches when there seemed to be no roots at all. I was severely burned with acids on
the head, which necessitated my removal to a hospital for treatment, and am very pleased at
the way your tonic has acted. Wishing you every success.” —S. RUSSELL, “ Leynwood,”
Prospect Terrace, Brisbane, Ist July, 1!)U ).
“About five years ago I began to u-e your Capilla, and I found it strengthened my hair
considerably. I honestly believe that if I had commenced using Capilla about nine or ten
years ago, I would have had as good a head of hair as I had in my youth. And I believe if
Capilla had been in vogue half a century ago there is many a man this day, if he were alive,
would be thankful ....” —JOHN G. LUCAS, Boorooma, via Brewarrina, N.S. \V., 7th July, 1909.

The latest little rooster hatched in a Maoriland piinting
office calls itself the Press Hank, and crows in the
interests of the Manawatu fiaxmill employees. It is
bright enough to deserve to live till it is tough and has
spurs 2ft. long. “This paper,” it remarks, “has not
come to supply a long-felt want. Nowadays it is no use
being there a long time after you’re wanted. If you are,
it’s a certainty the other fellow will get in first.” Further,
the Hank is" going to have an idea or two beyond flax :
its creed starts off: “No further borrowing except
for renewal, and the establishment of a sinking fund.”
A Maoriland paper that crows to that effect, even if
it only crows once a month, hasn’t arrived anyhow before
it was wanted.
The Age’s antics over the Fusion business has again
brought up the question of a Labor daily in Melbourne,
and the Trades Hall Council has been considering the
feasibility Of it. The idea suggested is that the paper
should be owned and controlled by the unions and the
Labour Council in conjunction ; capital to be raised by a
levy on members of both bodies, and a circulation to be
assured by making it obligatory on all unions and
P.L.C. branches to subscribe according to membership.
Heaps of difficulties are suggested now, as they always
have been. Bp't’this time, .anyhow, the barrackers for the
scheme are able to back ,q,p their arguments with the con-
crete case of the union-owned daily at Broken Hill ; and
the Melbourne advocates want to know why they can’t
make a “ do ” of a daily if it is possible for the Broken
llill miners to run one.
Wellington' Dominion —the moderately new M.L. daily
which is cutting into the profits of the old M.L. Times—
nowadays prints Government ads. with this note on top
of them
GOVERNMENT NOTICES,
f THE Government, despite the fact that the Dominion
has the largest circulation of any morning paper
in the Wellington province, has decided to boycott
the paper so far as Government advertisements are
concerned. In order that our readers may not suffer
from this grave abuse of Ministerial authority, we
publish the advertisement below at our own cost.
Some people want to turn up the M.L. Times’ register of
shareholders to discover who owns the Times’ stock;
but. it is possible that they wouldn’t get the true expla-
nation there. Still, the other explanation isn’t much
better —that the Joe Ward Ministry reckons a paper
shouldn’t get Government notices unless it is prepared to
whoop for the Joe Ward policy of borrow and bust.
* * * *
“Harrison O.”: There is something humorous in the
terrible anger of Melbourne Age when it contemplates
the suggestion that Hansard should be issued daily. I
don’t think much of the proposal myself, still I recognise
that it is papers such as the Agk that have driven legis-
lators to put it forward. The Age’s grossly unfair tactics
form in themselves a strong argument, or at any rate a
good excuse, for the suggestion. Thus by its glowing re-
ports of small gatherings of persons who said they wanted
to give a Dreadnought to Bull whether the poor fellow
wanted one or not, and by suppressing the reports of
meetings at which the idea was scoffed at, the Age blew
the Dreadnought bubble to such proportions that at last
it burst. In the same manner supporters of the Fused
Government nowadays deliver “ closely - reasoned
speeches ” and “ telling arguments ” while their oppo-
nents only indulge in “violent vituperation,” and their
most effective arguments are “ wild statements.” If a
daily Hansard were issued, a number of readers of the
Age would be quite surprised to discover that Labor
members make good, argumentative speeches ; in fact,
they would get to know a number of things which the
Age doesn’t feel inclined to tell them.
The reporting staffs of the Adelaide dailies are taking
steps to form a Journalists’ Institute on the lines of the
one in Sydney, though what the usually-underpaid Ade-
laide reporter really needs isn’t an “ institute,” but a
straight-out union.

“Moorabinda The wish of Robert Thomas and Co.
(the proprietors) and the editor (Mr. George Stephenson),
“to print the first number of the South Australian
Gazette and Colonial Register in the capital of the
civilised world and the second number in a city of the
wilderness,” the site of which was then unknown, was the
reason why the first number of the first South Australian
newspaper was published in London on the 18th of June,
1836, before the first vessel sent out from England
had sighted the shores of the new province. The
newspaper dealt more with probabilities than
certainties. Printers, presses, type and paper
were shipped to South Australia, and on .the third of
June, 1837, almost a year after the issue of the first num-
ber, the second number of the paper was published under
many difficulties, for the printers and workmen engaged
in England had mostly “ bettered themselves ” in other
employments. Moreover the printing office was only a
tent. But by degrees all difficulties were overcome, and
the Gazette and Register occupied its well-earned posi-
tion. The first Australian edition was not well received
by all, for the dissensions and disputes then raging, con-
sequent upon the divided authority of the Governor
and the Resident Commissioner, had led to the
formation of two parties, and as the Gazette and Register
stood by the Governor’s party, it became necessary to
establish another newspaper, and the Southern Austra-
lian, edited by Mr. Charles Mann, at that time Advocate-
General and Crown Solicitor, came into existence as the
organ of the other side. Official matters were sufficiently
complicated before the press asserted its liberty. They
became more so when the two papers took up their
parables and Commenced wordy warfare in strong lan-
guage, garnished with personalities. Perhaps “ Blanky”
wasn’t invented then, but the two papers used all the
language they knew.

“D.G.M.V: If you want to meet the genuine all-
round “ journalist,” go to Vic. One of my acquaintance,
who was a “smart man ” on a big Northern daily ere
ever the accursed der-rink got a half-Nelson on him, is
now editor, reporter, accountant, machinist and assistant
manager on an obscure sheet in the Mallee. (Also he’s re-
formed. But what of it ? Reformed drunks never make up
journalistic leeway.) In addition to mere literary work
(leader-writing, proof-reading, editing, etc.) ne \as to get
our. the accounts, battle up enough loot to pay wages,
“ fly ” and fold on Friday nights, and address the wrappers.
Likewise, being an old comp, it is his duty to set his bit
at the case and put in other fellows’ dis. on Saturday
afternoons. All this travail brings in £2 ss. a week. A
condition of his job is that he shall board with the boss
at £1 a week. On top of which he is compelled to do the
local correspondence for one of the Melbourne dailies—
which brings the boss £4 some money.
A BOOMERANG.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
It was a tender-pinioned little thing,
The song I made.
I said : “ Go spread your silver-silken wing,
Fly to the kindly editor and sing,
All unafraid,
And home again some store of treasure bring.”
Swiftly it sped upon its happy way
Down the sweet wind ;
It left its little perch at peep of day,
Three weeks in Sydney town it made its stay.
“ With thanks declined ”
It fluttered softly home again to say.
I sent it out upon another flight,
But it came back ;
No editor was gladdened at the sight,
Nor bade it sing for the dull world’s delight;
It learned the knack
Of boomeranging home again all right.
Now strive all fowls against my bird in vain,
It bears the palm ;
Home-seeking pigeons with despair are slain
What time the editor hath read my strain
And said one damn,
For swift as light my song is back again.

PIANOS
To Intending Piano Buyers
We are the recipients of thousands of testimonials from clients to whom we have supplied Pianos,
expressing their satisfaction with the tonal qualities and constructional and architectural excellencies
of the instruments. The value of such testimony is greatly enhanced by the fact that more than three
times as many BEALE PIANOS as those of any other maker are annually sold in the Commonwealth,
and there are now over 12,000 of them in use. But the crowning testimony of their excellence is
the awards of the four separate juries and the Grand Jury of the Eranco-Britisli Exhibition, held
in London May to October, 1908. Against more than a score of exhibitors, including the oldest
and foremost Erench and English makers, we achieved the largest number of awards ever made at
one time to one maker of Pianos :
GRAND PRIXfor “tonal qualities and g'eneral excellence.*’
The highest award in the power of the Grand Jury
to bestow.
DIPLOME d’HONNEUR —for Iron and Steel worK. This relates
principally to the Beale-Vader Patent Steel Tuning
System, which is used exclusively in our Pianos, and
is superior beyond comparison to the wooden
system of imported Pianos.
TWO GOLD MEDALS —for excellence of CabinetworK, and
perfedlion of organisation for the production of the
Beale Pianos.
Besides other orders taken in London for Beale Pianos, several were purchased for the magnificent
new Strand Palace Hotel, than whose reception rooms there are no finer in London.
Australians visiting London will thus be able to hear the latest music in the centre of the Empire
on Australian Pianos.
Before you decide to purchase elsewhere we would ask you to carefully consider all this weight of
evidence in favor of the high quality of the Beale Pianos. Get our beautiful three-color Catalogue,
showing the Pianos in their natural colors, which we shall be pleased to post you on application. If
it is not convenient for you to pay Cash Down we shall be pleased to arrange terms, and will take
your old Piano as part payment at a fair valuation.

IN BANANA LAND
Wanted, a Labor Ministry for Queensland.
Queensland is in the middle of another General
Election—the third since June, 1907. The Kid-
Pnilp Coalition goes to the country with its
majority down to one, and it is likely to return in
a much worse condition than that. How its oppo-
nents will return is another question, for the
party with a minority of one isn’t a solid body ;
it is mostly Labor, but the votes of certain Inde-
pendents have helped it materially during the
late session. And while Independents are often
reliable enough as part of an Opposition, they are
apt to be a very angry and disaffected lot when
the Opposition becomes the Ministry, and they
are refused a share of the portfolios. Queensland
is a place of curious and wonderful political hap-
penings. It is the State where polit.cal
treachery has reached its most perfect de-
velopment, and where Fusion has become a
habit as well as an art. It has been fairly
common there for the Government to whistle to the
leader of the Opposition and hold up a portfolio,
and for the feet of the leader of the Opposition to
only hit the ground once in his wild leap
across the Chamber to take possession. He
didn’t even wait to ask his party to come
with him; he just dropped his old job and
ran. And his party wasn’t much astonished
to see him rise next evening on the right side of
the House to defend the measures he was attack-
ing the previous evening on the left side. That
was the old order of things in Queensland, but
there is this to be said for the new order : The
discipline of the Labor party is strong enough to
make such political indecencies impossible in its
case. And they will soon be impossible with its
opponents, because they must ultimately settle
down in one camp for purposes of self-defence,
and there will be no one outside that camp
waiting to be purchased. There seems to be a
better period ahead ; a period when one party
will be clean by choice, and the other will be
cleaner by compulsion. A case like that of Uigbv
Denham, who managed to be in four successive
Ministries—the Li beral-Labor combine of Morgan,
the Liberal Ministry of Kidston, the Tory Minis-
try of Philp, and the Fused or J. Iscariot Govern-
ment which is now going to the country —will
soon be impossible.
The Kid-Philp combination is doomed if there
is any justice in the land. Kidston began well,
he progressed moderately, and he ended badly.
About his actual doings in the latter part of his
career—apart from his Philp coalition—there is
little to be said, for since the early part of 1907
there have been practically no doings. Queens-
land’s has been the most shut-up Parliament in
Australia, and when it has opened, as a temporary
matter of form, its achievementsbave been mostly
clamor and futility. Yet there is this to be said
for the various Governments w'ith which Kidston
has been connected (and though there are a num-
ber of side issues which make the thing not quite
so good as it looks, still it is a great deal to say):—

Despite certain circumstances which make the
showing not quite so good as it looks—syndicate
railways, for instance, and the fact that Kidston
was able to recover a trifle of the old reconstructed
loan moneys from the Q. N. Bank, and thus had
a certain amount of borrowed money to spend
without really borrowing—it was a marvellously
honest record for profligate Queensland. And it
is still more creditable that no loan money, so far
as can be traced, was spent on unproductive
works. But the sudden rise in the loan expendi-
ture after 1907, and the very much greater rise
which has happened since, and the increasing
tendency to dabble in syndicate railways, and
the creeping back on stealthy feet of the old
unprogressive Philp land policy and the old policy
of boom and extravagance, declare very clearly
that the Kidston who used to be has gone out of
business. In Queensland one cannot touch Philp
and not be politically defiled. Kidston has done
more than touch Philp : he has embraced him.
* y » * *
As to the Labor party, it is a pity that more is
not known with certainty. Now that William
Henry Browne is dead, and Kidston has ratted,
and Airey has become a free lance, it con-
sists mostly of men whose reputations are yet to
be made. If it is the same as its principal press
organ, then it is a purely parochial party with no
views outside Queensland. The paper which
speaks for Labor in Queensland regards the re-
payment of the public debt—even when it is
shown that it can be done by a process which won’t
cost the country a penny—as something too un-
important to be wdrth more than passing scorn.
It regards the effort to place the Federal capital
away from the immediate influence of the Tory
city press as a matter of absolutely no interest,
seeing that the Federal city won’t be in Queens-
land. And it looks on the transcontinental railway,
not as a great Australian work, but solely as a
means whereby the money, which Australia in
general must spend on railway building, may
by careful management be mostly diverted to and
spent in Queensland. If the party is like the paper,
then on Federal questions it is no better than
Kidston or Philp, and perhaps a shade worse
than Digby Denham. How it will pan out
on the borrowing question no one really knows ;
what capacity it will show at the Treasury can
only be guessed at. Still, certain things are
known for certain : The Labor party’s land policy,
which has for its basis a graduated tax to break
up great eiirth monopolies, is sound, while that of
the old Continuous Ministry was awful, not to say
infamous. The Labor party’s financial incapacity
can’t be worse than that of the old Continuous
crowd, for there is nothing worse. And it won’t
Fuse; its accession to power will mean a rest in a
clean spot, after nearly 20 years of political job-
bing, of buying and selling of portfolios, of'the
reckless and unashamed skurrying of leaders from
one side of the House to the other when a
salary hove in sight, and of such unrest
that no one knew what a “great politician’s”
principles might be to-morrow or what his

views might be next week. The system
which produced Drake (who surprised the
Australian Parliament when he imported into it
the Queensland lightning-change system), Tozer,
Philp, Foxton, Cowley. MTlwraith, Leahy, Cribb,
Denham, and so many other notorious shifters was
not a policy but a disease. And apparently it is only
by giving a strong vote for Labor that the old
Continuous crowd can be kept out of office.
Therefore every Queenslander who wants to save
his State’s politics from being the jest of Australia
should vote the Labor ticket unanimously.
Builoo, so long represented in Queensland
Assembly % Janny Leahy, and now likely to be
wiped out in a redistribution of seats, has one
other notable circumstance about’ it; though it
covers about one-eighth of the area of the State, it
does not possess a solitary church building. In the
early’nineties the Methodists erected a “bush”
house for holding their services at Thargomindah,
but it has passed away, and the courthouse or
shire hall is used nowadays when the rare parson
happens along.
Squatter J. T. Allan, the one link which
connects the present generation with the pioneers
of the Barcoo, and the first white man on the
river after Mitchell had more or less explored it,
lias decided to come in and make friends with
civilisation at last. When he dived out to the
Edge he drove his own leading bullock team, and
picked out the country under the shadow of
Mount Enniskillen. Unlike many other pioneers,
he managed to keep a bank balance on the right
side.
Brisbane had its municipal jubilee on
September 6. The first council consisted of John
Petrie, Patrick Mayne, T. B. Stephens, Joshua
Jeays, A. J. Hookings, George Edmondstone,
Robert Cribb, George Warren and W. S. Sutton,
Not one of them is now living. John Petrie was
the pioneer mayor, and was re-elected twice after-
wards. In all Brisbane has had 35 mayors in the
50 years. Old John McMaster, who is still in the
council, has worn the mayoral drapery oftenest —
for four terms. W. Boyce was the first town
clerk. He lasted for two years, after which
Thomas Dowse stuck to the billet till 1874; then
W. H. G. Marshall, the present clerk, took his
place. Among those present when the city cele-
brated in the usual moist manner the other day
were Kenneth McLennan and John Stack, two of
the ratepayers of 1859, and Andrew Petrie, the
eldest son of John Petrie.
Cairns woke up one recent morning to find
half a hundred Jap pearling boats anchored off
the town ; so with something like 200 Japs in the
streets, besides those who are there as a regular
thing, Cairns started to think harder than usual.
And it thought harder still when next day it read
this letter, written by “Daniel Smythe, master
mariner,” skipper of probably the best-known
schooner that flogs up and down the Queensland
coast: —
I am fully convinced that there is in every one of these
luggers one or more navigators of no mean standard. I
have had opportunity of seeing many things done by
them that would not be tolerated by any other Power.
On my way south in July I noticed a Japanese on shore
at Direction Island with a pocket sextant and compass,
and several others on Rocky Island semaphoring with
their arms and small flags. They know every anchorage
and fresh water along the coast, and the same thing
applies to the openings in the Great barrier reef. They
are master of the whole situation, and, if necessary, could
take a fleet of ships through the Barrier where our so-
called Torres Straits pilots would have no more know-
ledge of taking a ship through than one of your office
boys.
And Australia—well, Australia is just now being
invited to put such a tight leg-rope on its Com-
monwealth Government that, even if it wanted to
establish a decent naval force within the next 10
years, it wouldn’t have Buckley’s chance of
getting the money to do it.
The English fox is gradually finding his
way towards North Bananaland. The other day
one of him was killed at Dalgangal station, in
the Burnett district, making the second slain
thereabouts within the last 10 months. The latest
specimen was a full-grown male, who looked as
though the climate was suiting him. By the time
the prickly-pear problem has been solved, this
other imported curse will probably fill the
vacancy.• i
The other , day, a bothered Bananaland •
elector hunted up the Statute Revision Act of

Brisbane, September 11, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
A funny little story steps softly around in con-
nection with the departure of the Dudley Eatl
from the ugly wharf at Pinkenba. When the
vice-regal party with its bandbox and its pug (if
it had one) and its canary (if it owned the fowl)
was safely on board, his Ex., wishing to do the thing
acccording to Cocker, sent for the commander of
the naval guard of honor, joined him in a farewell
drink, and said the usual nice things. Now' the
noble one had intended to send for Commandant
Richerson, who was also upon the wharf ; but
some one had blundered, and when the mistake
was found out, it •whs too late to get the other man
aboard. ’Twas ever thus. The other fellow
always gets the whisky.
The town has been alive with delegates to the
Chamber of Commerce Convention, and it is said
that they have gazed with gleaming eyes upon
even the small glimpses of our resources which
they were able to see, as they rushed whirlwind-
like from here to Mount Morgan and back. It is
also said that their livers have been seriously
affected by the many dinners to which they have
been beguiled. The chief function, a reception at
the Exhibition Hall on Thursday eve last, was a
jewel of a gathering with a dream of a spread at
the tail end of it.
After about 609 teas and lunches to do honor to
the occasion, Mrs. Norman Armytage and the tall
daughter went southward by the Wyreema. There
was a final gathering of the clans the previous
day, and much floral work was piled upon the
vessel’s deck.
The big Mayoral reception on Monday was a
gathering worthy of the Jubilee occasion it cele-
brated. Thousands of humans with robust appe-
tites swarmed the Exhibition grounds, and shook
out the tails of their very best frocks upon the
gravel. Mayoress Wilson, in a pretty blue gar-
ment put on with her usual success, was a
pleasing contrast to the Sombre mayoral robes and
gold chain. I sometimes wonder whether, sup-
posing his Worship elects to address his consti-
tuents in these, his gladdest rags (for it is now
finally decided that he shall eross swords with
Forrest and Macartney), is there any known by-
law to restrain him? If there isn’t, then he will
certainly carry himself and; Socialist Pieman;
Smythe to £3OO a year and a seat on the Parlia-j
mentary benches.
At the amateur dramatic show in aid of the;
fallen soldiers’ long-delayed memorial, the Lister
family did itself proud. Daughter Phoebe, assisted
by pretty Miss Reade and Mr. Page Gray, made
a gem of the quaint comedy “Thirteen ” ; while
Mrs. Spencer Brown and Mrs. Flo Pearson, also
George Webster and Mason Beatty, were far from
being utterly horrible in “Charity Begins at
Home.” Mrs. Flo particularly brought down the
house, and the owners are said to be after her for
damages. Much profit yvill accrue,,
Mrs. Gilbert Wilson warbled in her very best
tone at the orchestral concert on Wednesday.
Her music was as new and Well-chosen as her
garb, and that says much.
During the sojourn of the “crimson warblers” in
this city, there was a gay little party at the Q’Shea
bungalow, when Marie Narelle and her two
infants were the chief attractions. The younger
hope seems to have the family voice, and when a
few more years and lessons have rolled over her
head, she should take a hand at collecting shekels
with her dramatic young art and delicious trill.
The other girleen plays some, and does it well.
The cakes for the resist that followed the music
were built by Marie : herself. Domestic virtues
often go with a light hand for pastry.
On the first night of Bentley’s ’’Hamlet,” the
interest was such that a crowded house sat still
until 11.30. Then it darted into the street to see
its last tram under way. Things grew serious for
oue citizen who had escorted a pal’s wife to the
show, for cabs and taxis were clutched as in a
frenzy. It ended by him having to walk home
with her to Hamilton (five miles), make a long
explanation to a doubting husband, and return to
town and a mile or so beyond per boot in the very
small hours. Another lost his train and had to
doss in town, arriving home early enough to catch
it hot at sunrise. If Lord Badger, of the Private
Enterprise trams, continues to decree that this
city shall keep the hours of the common or barn-
door fowl, the city fathers had better have a word
(or, better still, a brick) with him upon the
matter.
The Walter Bentley .people are an extremely
juvenile lot; in fact, if you takeaway the accumu-
lated experience of Hamlet Mathias Bentley him-
self and Jimmy Atholwood, their added years
would scarcely earn an old-age pension. They
are, however, precocious children, from Miss
Ophelia, who looks young enough to like almond
toffee, to Horatious Hunter, whose pipe (he puffs
one in his spare moments, just to show his mature
grown-up-ness) ought to be a chocolate cigar.
Also they give a right good Shakspearian account
of themselves. Then there is a very young person
who rejoices in the name of Laing-Meason, and so
nice is she at her present age that I hope she will
remain there for some years. The pages in
“Hamlet” are really too young, though. They
giggle and wriggle, which they would never
have been allowed to do at that ancient and sedate
Danish Court.
Pretty Nellie Callan, with her top thatch of red-
yellow hair, is no more, No, she is not even
moderately dead or any thing like that; but she
was married to her apple-grower in a quiet way
on Tuesday. Mr. Hugh Ashton Warner, to give
him his full title, found his bride awaiting him in
a crfpe-de-chine billow. She was armed with a
prayer-book instead of a “bookay,”and was backed
up by Miss Kathleen Hart, a very pretty referee.
The old man gave his daughter away, and brother
Maurice held up his new brother-in-law. The
moon honeyed at picturesque Cleveland.
Another lot of rash promises were indulged in
next day. Mr. F. H. Needham and Miss Eileen
Reed, a daughter of the late G. M. Reed, of God’s
Own Country, exchanged the prescribed vows at
Warwick, which place the bridegroom’s father
owns with some trifling exceptions. The lights
of many lamps shone upon the ceremony, and
many gifts were showered upon the young experi-
menters. Earlier in the day the same line of
business occupied the attention of Miss Marjorie
Robinson and Mr. Valentine P. Shannon, at
Toowoomba. The foundation stone of future
happiness was well and truly laid by the Rev.
Teesdale Cockell and Canon Oakley. Finally,
Mr. C. A. Whish took unto himself Miss Girlie
Margetts, at Warwick, the special chiffon gown
being topped with a lovely old veil.
The Government candidates are now in the
field, 50 strong, but there is little new blood, and
the same old stories are only a little older than
last time.
Sincerely yours,
MARIO.


QUEENSLAND AND COPPER.
Queensland, for the last two years, has led the
Commonwealth in copper production. This is
a sign of the revival of interest in the possi-
bilities of developing the greatest copper mining
fields in the world.
QUEEN DEEP GOLD MINES, CHARTERS TOWERS.

Queensland copper is found in the same matrix ores
with gold, silver and lead; and the up-to-date
processes are making these ores increasingly
productive.
Mount Morgan is the greatest producer of copper in
Queensland, and her copper riches are becoming
so great that it is achieving an equality with
the gold of the Mount, and is no longer regarded
as a mere by-product.
Dr. R. L. Jack, formerly Government Geologist of
Queensland, speaking of the Cloncurry district,
declared: “ The local definition of ‘ poor ores ’
is from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent., according
to locality. This is more significant of possi-
bilities when one considers the few big mines of
the world that have ore of anything this quality
to treat.”
Cloncurry, one of the numerous copper-bearing dis-
tricts of Queensland, has “ the largest tract of
copper-bearing country in Australia, and one
of the largest in any country.”
This one district alone has been proved to be copper-
bearing over an area of 15,000 square miles, a
territory as large as Denmark, and larger than
Belgium.
The revival of copper-mining and the improvement
of the treatment processes will have a salutary
effect upon the future prospects of Queensland.

A RICH COPPER COUNTRY.
BY J. D. FITZ GERALD, Barrister-at-Law.
Queensland has the greatest undeveloped copper
fields of any country in the world. The vagaries
of Queensland copper are interesting equally to
the geologist and the physicist. This most useful
industrial product of the mine has a way of in-
sinuating itself into the ores of other metals
until it almost ousts them. Mount Morgan ores
bear copper and gold as twin, products. In 1907
the value of the copper product approached that
of the gold. The figures were: Gold, £584,000;
copper, £385,700. In that year Queensland forged

ducer of the Australian group, the figures being :

South Australia 705,031

It was in the year 1906 that the great Northern
,f?tate first took the lead in copper production.
In its insidious ways copper has also made itself
the prehistoric bedfellow of silver and lead ; and
the Queensland ores often contain all three of these
rich metals. There is no metal which has a more
assured future. It depends not upon fashion, as
pearlshell does, but upon machinery and the evolu-
tion of electricity, until that wonderful and mvs-
terious thing does all the world’s work—down to
washing up the dishes —as the electrical en-
thusiasts expect will be the millennial outcome of
the discoveries now going on. Copper has gone
into partnership with the electrical current, and,
like a willing horse, bears its rider upon its tasks
and messages. Even if “wireless” were to super-
sede the present system, there is still enough call
for machinery and enough use of copper in
machinery to make the future of copper mining
assured. At any rate, those who know (and
amongst those the Government of Queensland)
have had no diminution of confidence in the
future of the industry.
The copper territory
of Queensland is of wide
extent. In the Clon-
curry district an area of
15,000 square miles has
been proved to be cop-
per-bearing. In no other
natural wealth-producing
industry in Australia
has there been so little,
comparatively, done to
market the product as
in Queensland. This is
not on account of the
want of enterprise of
the people, or of aid
from the Government.
It was the fault of cir-
cumstances which, in the
past, militated against
the production and the
treatment of the ore.
These circumstances are
gradually being over-
come. The whole of the
transactions connected
with the development of
the industry were gov-.,
erned by the price of re-
fined copper in London.
Where the copper de-
posits exist over a huge
territory like Queensland
—a territory larger than
the combined areas of
Germany, France, Spain,
Portugal and Greece —
and where the develop-
ment of the country with
regard to communication, shipping, etc., is im-
perfect, the difficulties of copper development can
easily be realised.
Consequently, for many years, the attempts at
the exploitation of copper mines were sporadic
and unsatisfactory. The rich surface outcrops
were worked out, and the mines were abandoned.
Few attempts were then made to prove the deeper
levels—attempts which had such magnificent
results with regard to gold prospecting. But the
State railways gradually came along to supersede
the camel as the transporter of copper ore to
treatment plants; the splendid ocean-going
steameys, encouraged by a wise policy of Govern-
ment, began to put into the ports of Queensland
to take the ores or the matte afield to places
where the processes were more perfect; and year
by year the results to the investor in Queensland
copper became more and more satisfactory. The
companies themselves even became railway
builders. The newer discoveries in the scientific
treatment of ores reduced the cost of working and
gave higher results. Foreign capitalists from
London and Paris took a hand in the work. The
later processes in some eases won enough gold

from the copper ores to pay the cost of production,
and the price of the copper was profit.
The general development of all the services of
the State of Queensland has had a beneficial effect
upon the copper industry. Settlement has gone
outward ; the more complex services of govern-
ment have been extended to the mining zones.
Land has been taken up; pastoral and agricultu-
ral development has created supplies near the
mines. Then, with the modern discoveries in
metallurgical processes, mines formerly abandoned
have been taken up again and worked. Outside
influences, too, have had some weight. The
growth of electrical power as a factor in the
mechanical world has meant a demand for metals

like copper. Distance
from thd world’s markets,
too, and difficulties of
transport made Queens-
land’s copper mines the
first victims of any slump
in price. In the early
days it only paid to
work the rich surface
ores. The first mine
developed, the Peak
Downs, was a veritable
bonanza. Its paid-up
capital was only £20,000.
Notwithstanding the
heavy cost of working in
those days, the richness
of the ores—averaging 25
percent, metal—resulted
in the dividends replac-
ing the original capital
twelve-fold.
This return of confi-
dence in the copper possi-
bilities of Queensland
means much to the whole
State. It is a factor well
worth the careful con-
sideration of the prospec-
tive emigrant who is
turning his thoughts to-
wards the Great South
Land. From every port
and train terminal rail-
ways run away into met-
alliferous districts. The
Mount Morgan. Glad-
stone, Upper Burnett,
Mackay districts, Clon-
curry, Clermontand other
copper districts are within easy distanceof railways.
The necessity of a refining plant is felt at present;
but the industry is comparatively in its infancy,
and the development will, year by year, go on
with; increasing momentum. That this is no idle
boast is proven by the impulse in copper produc-
tion which has placed Queensland ahead of the
sister States during the last two years. The needs
BRILLIANT DEEPS MINE? CHARTERS TOWERS.
created by this development in regard to copper
refining are being tentatively met by-the estab-
lishment at Port Kembla (N.S.W.) of an up-to-
date refining and smelting works.
The industry has had some set-backs, too, the
result of over-capitalisation and “ exploiting ” in
its bad sense. There have always been hangers-
on of new fields who went on the theory so
long and vigorously denounced in The Bulletin,
that “ It is easier to get gold out of London than
out of the mines.” That idea has been swept
away. Moreover, the feverish impatience of the
“get-rich-quick” men has been cured, and the
investor now approaches copper-mining, not as a
gamble, but as a legitimate form of speculation, in
which the rewards are commensurate with the
risk taken ; but in which, also, the risks are brought
to an irreducible minimum by honest as well as
skilful expert advice. The investor certainly
“ takes chances ” in copper-mining ; but then, so
he does in ship-owning, in soft-goods, or in
brewery or bank shares. Queenslanders are
learning the business of copper development as
the Americans learned it.
The main fact which is important so far as
these articles are concerned is this : that among
the undeveloped resources of the great territories
of Queensland there are immense regions in which
copper in the very richest qualities, and in inex-
haustible quantity, is found. This is no mere
guesswork ;it is easily ascertainable. Should the
agricultural or pastoral immigrant ask what usethe
existence of such deposits would be to him, the
answer is that the development of every native re-
source of a new State causes ripples of energy and
progress which run throughout the whole com-
munity. and the effects of which are not bounded
by the limits of the State, or even of the Common-
wealth, but are felt in London, Paris and Berlin. A
country which has all the primary products ready
to hand, a fertile soil, a benignant climate,
abundance of coal, iron, copper, silver, gold,
tin and the rarer metals in ample measure,
only wants population to make it rich. Where
the resources of a country are diversified, the
occupations of the people of that country will be
diversified, and there will be a wider choice of
avocation for the young, fewer misfits in the
avenues of life, and better results to the nation.
That phase of the subject I emphasise, because
congeniality of occupation —whether in the bar-
rister, the "butcher, the doctor or the carpenter —
means contentment and even happiness.
One of the signs which should be most reassur-
ing to the immigrant is this re-birth of the copper
mining industry. The prospects of one district
alone—viz., Clohcurry—would be regarded by any
country as a great national asset. A proved
copper-bearing territory as large as Denmark and
larger than Belgium, which constitutes only one
of many fields of the huge State of Queensland,
has been pronounced by experts of all nations to
have greater possibilities than any other copper
field known in the world. The development of
Chillagoe during the last few years has been won-
derful, the shareholders showing their faith by
building a lengthy railway (the longest private
railway in the Commonwealth) and a number of
tramway lines, and erecting a splendid treatment
plant and works, driven by electric power.
The great Mount Morgan Company has brought
its splendidly organised and wealthy forces to the
aid of copper development, not only in the estab-
lishment of the electrolytic, plant at Port Kembla,
but by prospecting and opening up a new district
at Many Peaks, near Gladstone. As to this, Mr.
Critchley Parker tells us that “In the ground
owned by the company, the lode is exposed at
many points over a distance of about 2000 ft. It
averages over 30ft. wide, and maintains its size
and value to a depth of 370 ft. When the railway
(projected by the Government from Gladstone
along the Boyne River valley) is completed
Mount Morgan proposes to take 70.000 tons a year
of this fluxing ore to its main works; and it is
not outside the bounds of probability that a year
or two hence may see the erection of smelting
works at Gladstone,! the finest natural port of
Queensland.” With all the drawbacks which have
been indicated above, the value of copper yielded
in Queensland up to the end of 1907 was approxi-
matelv £5,428,179 ; and that is only the beginning
of things.

MELBOURNE, VICTORIA
S. Australia is just perpetrating a silly
piece of make-believe. Forty years or so back,
vvhen the Duke of Edinburgh visited Adelaide,
the delighted Province proclaimed a holiday on
his birthday, August 6, and nailed it down by Act
of Parliament. Later on, however, the Parlia-
ment moved it to September 1 so as to fit in with
Eight Hours Day, but still declared it to be “in
honor of the Duke.” The Duke died in July,
1900, but the holiday remained ; and now because
September 1 has been wet for several successive
years, it is to be moved once more to the middle
of October—still to suit the Eight Hours celebra-
tion. Yet the Bill under which this is beingdone
still retains the Ducal fiction, the explanation
being that it is not wise to pass any legislation in
the interests of one particular class, though nobody
ever thinks of that stupid piece of cant when, for
interest, seed-wheat grants are being authorised
for farmers.
“ Galleryite ” speaks :
Willie Kelly started out recently to be a Thorn in the
Fused Government’s side. I think his original scheme
was to combine for the impressing of Parliament and the
cowing of the Fusees, the most picturesque features
of John Wilkes, W. E. Gladstone and Winston Churchill.
Then things happened, and now he has gone cold on the
idea. He was an anti-Fusionist from the start. His
chief Joss or idol is G. Reid. He regards G. Reid as a
model for all aspiring young State Frighters. Joe Cook
he dislikes for several reasons, but chiefly because Joseph
is considered by the friends of Reid to have callously
pushed the latter from his billet as Opposition leader.
Deakin has always declined to take William seriously, and
so he disapproves of Deakin and hasi doubts about his
sanity. In due course William’s whipship was torn from
him and handed over to Hume Cook. That was the ulti-
mate straw. The anguished ex-whip caused it to be pro-
mulgated that the Government would suffer for its mad,
unconsidered action. The news went round that he pro-
posed to rend the. Government, and to do the deed, more-
over, in so devilishly subtle a fashion that none could get
back on him in any way. The Government remained
outwardly calm, and so William went and packed his
clothes while one division was in progress, and stayed
away from another division. But before he could
do more of this spirited work there arrived an in-
furiated clamor from Wentworth, which he represents,
and which seems to be about the only constituency
that wholly approves of the Fusion. Wentworth,
through certain of its Anti-Sosh leagues, demanded of
William what the blazes he meant by it. Furthermore,
it is understood to have notified him that he is there at
the pleasure of those who control the party nomination
alone, and that the f ite of Jessep, the reject of Waverley,
will be his unless he ambles along the straight and
narrow path. In c msequence, William has abandoned
his intention of being a Thorn. On the other hand, he
can’t so far stultify himself, just yet, as to blossom sud-
denly into a Rose. His present position in the vegetable
kingdom may be best described as that of a Burr, and a
diminutive and humble variety of plant-growth at that.
Fat is always lamenting its party’s habit
of being too fatigued to go to the poll, and point-
ing to Labor’s organisation and attention to
public duty ; but Fat can vote early and often
when it suits. At the August Victorian muni-
cipal elections one F. W. Dawborn was put up
against Propputy. Dawborn is hardly an ad-
vanced radical, but lie has ideas ; also at the last
Parliamentary election he gave Swinburne the
shivers, wherefore Fat bogged in something extra,
and Dawborn’s 374 votes were lost beside his
• opponent’s 559. Those two sets of figures mean,
allowing for informal votes, about 960 votes alto-
gether, although there are only 040 voters on the
roll. The fool Victorian law allows a vote for
each separate rated property, bricks, not human
beings, being the criterion of intelligence; and of
these plural votes Dawborn got 38, and his
opponent 274. That is, Dawborn was supported
by 330 individuals and 38 houses, and was
defeated ; his opponent was supported by 285
individuals and 274 masses of masonry, and the
masses of masonry won. Which is one reason
why it is so difficult for Labor to get a look-in at
the Vic. municipal councils.
Premier Wade’s immigrants may collect
some comfort from contrasting their troubles with
the tough experiences of immigrant Henry
Parkes, afterwards Premier of N.S.W. He wrote
(May 1, 1840):
For more than two weeks I kept beating about Sydney
for work, during which time I sold one thing and another
from our little stock for support. At length, being com-
pletely starved out, I engaged as a common laborer with
Sir John Jamieson, Kt., M. 0., to go 36 miles up thecoun-
trv. Sir John agreed to give me £25 for the year, with a
ration and a half of food. This amounted to weekly :
lOJlb. beef—s mietimes unfit to eat
lojlb. rice—of the worst imaginable qnality
6Jlb. flour—half made up of ground rice
21b. sugar—good-tasted brown
Jib tea—inferior
j b soa|>-rnot enough to wash our hands
2 figs of tobacco—useless to me.
This was what we had to live upon, and not a leaf of a
Vegetable or a drop of milk beyond this. For the
first four mouths we bad no other bed than
a sheet of bark off a box-tree, and an old
door laid on two Cross pieces of wood, covered
over wiih a few articles of clothing. The hut appointed
- for us to live in was a very poor one.V. . The slave-
inasters of New South Wales require their servants to
work for them from sunrise to sunset, and will not allow
them to have gardens, lest they should steal a half-hour’s
time to work in them. ... I left last February, having
been in his service six months. ... I have not seen one
singleijrdividual who came out with me in the Strath-
Aeldsaye but most heartily wishes himself back at Home.
... I am at present at work for Messrs. Russell Brothers,
engineers and brassfounders, Queen’s Place, George-
street. 1 get five shillings per day, finishing brasswork.
In a little while, however, Parkes got on to much
more lucrative brasswork, which he left unfinished.
He became a politician, distinguished as the “old
Parliamentary hand,”and had many of the “slave-
masters of New South Wales” imploring him to
give them a lift into the Assembly or a life job in
the Council.
SOME VERY GENTLE INDUCEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
The Land Tax Bill was then introduced and read a first
time. . . The Bill seeks to induce owners to put their
land to better use, or to sell it to those who would use
it to greater advantage. —News item.
The gentle Land-Tax droppeth down
In sixteenths of a copper ;
It comes not as a good half-crown,
It is a gentle dropper.
If it had been a good half-crown
It would have been a stopper !
The gentle Land-Tax slowly falls
And, like the dew from Heaven,
It merely cools the squatter's halls,
And dunps his boots—Size Seven.
It merely cools the squatter’s halls,
And damps his feet—Size Seven !
The dewlike Tax we take with thanks
For those that drive the binder ;
It doesn’t help to fill the tanks,
But it’s a small reminder.
It doesn’t help to fill the tanks—
The aching, gaping, dusty tanks ;
But still we take the thing with thanks
’Cause it’s a small reminder !

OF THE
Breakfast Table
The Stewart-Dawson News Stand
introduces a new era of peace at
—— the Breakfast Table.
smsm
A Familiar Story.
The Stewart-Dawson Newspaper Stand inaugurates a new era of peace at
the breakfast table.
It makes the dual task of eating your breakfast and reading the morning
news both easy and comfortable. It eliminates risk of accident.
The paper is firmly fixed at a convenient angle where you can read without
any fear of a catastrophe in the rear.
The morning news can be read without straining your eyes, without
working yourself into an awkward position, and your hands are quite free to
attend to the knife, fork and spoon business.
To the busy business man, whose first, best and only opportunity of seeing
the morning news is during the breakfast hour, it is a real necessity.
For the Busy Business Man.
Most men are acquainted with the difficult problem of trying to fix the
newspaper on the breakfast table in such a way as to make it easy to read.
And most women are familiar with the failures men have made of this
interesting little problem.
The milk jug, the cruet, the flower-stand, the breakfast-cup, arid a dozen
other improvised stands have been tried with more or less success —mostly less.
And very frequently the result has been disaster.
The milk-jug or the flower-vase has objected to its new duties, and has
“ rolled away ” from the morning news—and the wife has objected to the
damage to the table-cloth. And so the day has started badly.
It’s a familiar story, isn’t it ?
:
For the Housewife.
The Housewife will welcome this handy little news stand with open arms.
It will put an end to those unfortunate little spills that usually happen to the
clean table cloth. And whilst the stand is intended for practical use only, it is an
improvement to the breakfast table. Made in a medium size, and neat in design,
it doesn’t occupy too much room, and is decidedly ornamental in appearance.
And there are other uses to which it can be put besides that of a news-
paper stand. When not in use, it can be folded and laid flat. When travelling,
it can be easily packed.
Supplied in plain nickelled quality, with adjustable stand and newspaper
clips, 4/0 ; in best quality silver-plate, 12/0-

Down to the end of June, N. S. AYales had
bought back 321,208 acres for closer settlement at
a total cost of £1,183,349 ; and expenses in connec-
tion with the business had brought the total out-
lay up to £1,241,631. Down to the same date only
£73,133 had been actually received from settlers ;
but the balances payable on the lots that have
been taken up amount to £1,113,327. Add what
has been received to what is payable, and it leaves
the State £51,171 to the bad ; but as against that
it has a number of blocks on its hands which it
reckons are worth £104,985. Whether it will get
that for them is another matter ; if it does, and if
it manages to collect all the unpaid balances,
the business as far as it has gone shows a profit
of £49,814.
The other day the S. M. Herald stated
that Japan last year imported machinery to the
value of £3,498,500, an increase of over 80 per
cent, in two years. It added :
As the average wage of a skilled workman in Japan
does not usually exceed Is. 2d. or Is. 3d. per day, the
advantages that the manufacturers of that country
possess are obvious.
But the Herald stopped there. It didn’t men-
tion that it used to shudder at the idea of a
20 per cent. Customs duty ; but that it would
clearly have to get used to the idea of even a 100
per cent. Protective duty now that a manufactur-
ing nation has arrived which can buy or borrow
modern machinery and get it worked-by skilled
men at an average wage of under fifteen-pence a
day.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining:
membrane of the nose and adjoining-
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try oijr

Several towns in England which own
dangerous corners in narrow thoroughfares have
recently erected ingeniously arranged mirrors
that enable the frantic motorist, as he dashes on
his way of destruction, to see what there is waiting
to be killed round the corner. Also small mir-
rors are now attached to the dash-boards of some
cars, so that the driver can get a view of the
traffic behind. If only something could now be
invented that would keep the driver’s attention
glued on the things ahead, the poor, jumpy pedes-
trian might almost begin to get a show.

TREE DRUGS!
WHY don’t you stop it? You are still doctoring, but changing doctors does not cure
» * you. You are trying one medicine after the other with the same disgusting disappoint-
ment. You are a “ medicine doser,” and the only change in your condition is for the wbrse.
Why don’t you stop this medicine habit ? Why don't you avail yourself of
the modern remedy ? Proceed on Natures own lines. Use the life-giving* healing,
strengthening forces of Electricity ! This is the electric age. You can see on every
hand the wonders of Electriqty. You don’t need doctors ; you don’t need medicine,
for medicine gives no nourishment. You DO need Electric Life Force. Use it as we
apply it and you will be well, strong and happy.
Nearly every ailment which afflicts humanity, outside of contagious diseases, is due to the breaking-
down of some vital organ. When a certain part fails to dp its allotted task the entire human
machinery goes to smash. The only way to regain health—even life—is to rebuild the weak part
which has caused all the trouble by obtaining a new supply of vital electric energy. This can
only be properly done with the new improved
DR. MCLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT.
There is no disputing the virtue in Electricity as a cure for weakness and pains. The brainiest doctors living now admit it, but there has
been a doubt that anyone had mastered the best way of applying it. The doctor’s battery is crude-shocks too much, and at best can only be
applied for half-an-hour at a time, which is not enough to do any good. Those other machines in a doctor’s office never reach the trouble. .
Electricity, as applied by DR. McLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT, is the modern, up-to date method. No shock, no burning or
blistering, and you wear it for hours at a time while sleeping or during the day.
£5OO REWARD.
We guarantee every Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt sold by us to give a powerful current of
genuine electricity which can be instantly felt, and we will forfeit JESOO to anyone proving
the contrary.
It is a quick and lasting cure for Debility, Weakness of all kinds, Varicocele, Rheumatism, Weak Back, Sciatica,
Lumbago, Indigestion, Weak Kidneys, Tailing Memory, and all evidence of Break-Down.

“ W.8.M.” on the long innings of Harry
Levien, M.L.A. :
R. 11. Levien. dad of N.S.W. Assembly, is just complet-
ing his 29th year in the House, and doesn’t look to have
suffered any wear and tear in the process. The only
change that has come over him since 1880 is that he is
even a trifle balder now than he was at the beginning:.
Of all the men who entered the House before or with
Levien, not one remains there. G. H. Reid and BillLyne
are in the House of Representatives, and W. J. Tnckett
is in the Council with Captain Charles, Colonel Holborrow,
John Mclntosh, Henry Moses and P. B. Suttor. Dr. Ross
is hopping about Surry Hills, and a few — very few—others
are still in the sunlight. But death has claimed the most
of Levien’s Parliamentary contemporaries. What a
list—John Blaxland, Edward Butler, James Chis-
holm, G. H. Cox, W. B. Dailey, Deas-Thomson, Joseph
Docker. “Water Jug” Poster, Hay, Holt, Innes, Jen-
nings, Macarthur, Robertson, Samuel, Alfred Stephen,
Jas. White, Burdekin, Speaker Allen, David Buchanan,
Fletcher, Cameron, Copeland, Davies, Farnell, Michael
Fitzpatrick, Forster, Garrett, Garvan, Lloyd, McElhone,
Parkes, Melville, Renwick, R. Burdett Smith, Sutherland,
Stuart, S. H. Terry, J. P. Abbott, Windeyer, Henry
Clark, Wisdom, Salomons, See and Dibbs. Then there
were those who came after him, and have» been
called away : Crick, A. G. Taylor, Dalton, Inglis,
Nicoll, Tom O’Mara, Harold Stephen, and others. Harry
Levien, after being a party man all his Parliamentary life,
finds himself more or less docketed with the Deform
crowd, with which he has very little in common. Now
that he has the Peel River resumption fixed up for land-
locked Tamworth, he will, no doubt, prove an anxiety to
Wadeism, which knows that he is not at all comfortable
in the political company he has been keeping.

WOOD-MILNE Rubber Heels have
revolutionised footwear. The old-
fashioned leather heel is rapidly
becoming obsolete. It is universally
recognised to-day that rubber is the
correct substance for _ boot-heels,
softens the shock of walking on hard

walk. Moreover, Wood-Milne Rubber
lasts far longer than leather, and so

In Nature’s Service.
Men, women and (especially) children need at
times a corrective, laxative remedy when Nature
is sluggish in her duties. Biliousness, headache,
indigestion and flatulence generally indicate a
constipated condition, and the surest, safest and
pleasantest help to Nature is
This ideal household laxative has gained its
great reputation by sheer merit, as it is quite
opposed to old-time ideas of drastic purgation,
and acts thoroughly but gently and naturally
upon the liver, stomach and kidneys without any
discomfort at all. Be sure, therefore, that you.

[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
nVTTGHT’S fever spills its phantoms o’er the
I sea;
The lone bush rustles, and a tui thrills;
In purity between the dawn and me
The snow’s white altar cloth is on the hills.
Wakes in the waiting air a breeze that chills
The sweating murk that held me long in pawn,
And the parched soul deep drinks of sparkling
rills
From snows transfigured in a roseate dawn.
The opening petals of a budding day
See all the east to glorious tatters rent;
Gaunt scowling peaks, and rugged skylines grey,
Grim sentinels of deep and continent,
So old, so silent, yet so eloquent;
Hope’s angel with her touch omnipotent
Descends in radiance on those ramparts lone,
And, like a mother o’er a son sore spent,
She stoops and kisses those scarred brows of
stone.
The fine-spun splendors of the rainbow pale
Before the marvels born of that caress ;
Nature for one sweet moment lifts the veil;
Jehovah’s face is seen, to smile, to bless;
And mountain ranges melt to loveliness.
Through rift and gorge the Dawn’s proud banners
RO,
While the sun’s rays like rosy children press
In bright battalions o’er the homeless snow.
Morning has come and gone, and now high noon
Has clothed the heights and scarps with robes
of heat.
In the warm breeze the old trees rock, and croon
Strange songs to nursling flowers beside their
feet;
For Spring hath set her green upon the wheat.
In sun-lit vales pale passions swoon and die,
And in the haze where sky and ocean meet
I see the shadowy ships of Destiny.
Longer the shadows grow, and deeper yet
The tints of serried hills against a sky
That floods their flanks with gold and violet;
And purple clouds rest on them lovingly.
In mute farewell the heavens the hills draw
nigh.
High altars burning to the dying day
The mountains glow ; nor can one wonder why
The lonely Nazarene “ went up to pray.”
Tuere goes a shiver through the upland grass ;
The fires of Day have dwindled to a spark;
The hills snow-hooded in procession pass
And one by one go out where all is dark ;
Save some great pinnacle austere and stark
Which stands till blindness smites the land and sea
To aching blackness void of shape or mark,
And Night once more hath laid hot hands on me.

i SIMPLY want them ! ” Kitty re-
iterated, petulantly.
As she sat on the throne-stool, stabbing
viciously with a crimson sunshade at the toe of a
patent-leather shoe, Lenton had difficulty in re-
cognising in her his one-time model. He scruti-
nised her carefully, then lighted his pipe.
“ Well, you simply can’t have them ! ” he told
her.
“ Then what do you intend to do ? ”
“ Keep them,” Lenton answered.
“I never gave you permission,” Kitty declared.
“They were to be destroyed. That was the
arrangement. Don’t you remember how at the
time I told you to burn them ? ”
“You frequently ordered me to do things,”
Lenton agreed.
“ I now demand ! ”
“Don’t be so hysterical,” Lenton protested.
“ When I made those sketches you were my
model. I paid you even unto the uttermost
farthing, and, consequently, the drawings are
mine. I may say I intend to keep them.”
“Now, Freddy, that’s nasty when you know
how desperately I want them.”
“So you’ve got to being desperate about it,”
Lenton mused. “ What can have brought you to
that state of mind? Want of money? Surely
you don’t contemplate selling those drawings ?
Sketches of pretty women in the nude would lead
to trouble in the post-card world, and yet that
would be the only market for them. Can’t think
what you want them for, Kitty.”
“That doesn’t alter the fact that I do want
them.”
“ Can’t you find a reason for the desire that is
m you ? ”
“I simply want them,” the girl answered with
a pout.
There was a long pause during which Kitty
minutely scrutinised one of her shoes, turning it
first one way and then another that she might the
better admire its grace and beauty.
“What are you doing these days?” Lenton
asked, abruptly breaking the silence in an en-
deavor to change the subject.
“Just nothing,” was the response.
“Seems rather a prosperous occupation,”
Lenton rejoined, glancing at her critically. “It
appears to have carried you into the realm of
those who dress in purple and fine linen.”
“That alone makes it bearable.”
“ Taken to the stage again ? ”
“You’re not far wrong, for I have some heavy
acting to do.”
"Be careful !” Lenton broke in. “Don’t ask
me to solve detective problems. I have recently
been warned against severe exertion.”
Kitty smiled wearily.
“I’m married,” she confessed.
“Ye gods!” was Lenton’s exclamation as he
dropped his pipe and sprang to his feet. For a
moment he stood there facing the girl in silende ;
then the exquisite humor of the thing burst upon
him and he laughed long and loud.
“You have my sympathy,” he eventually
assured her.
Kitty carefully placed her purse and sunshade
on one corner of the throne and clasped her hands
around her knees.
“Thats why I want the sketches,” she con-
fided.
“ Hang the sketches! ” Lenton snapped, as he
groped for his pipe. “Tell me about him. Has
he money?”
“ Why ask unnecessary questions?”
“I thought you might have married for love.”
“ Your thoughts are generally absurd.”
“ Can he be classed as respectable?” was Len-
ton’s next question.
“O, very ! ”
“ Then I am certain not to have the honor of
his acquaintance,” Lenton remarked. “But tell
me about him.”
“ He’s very pious,” Kitty began.
“ Good Lord ! ” was Lenton’s mournful ejacula-
tion. “Goon!”
“ He’s awfully good,” Kitty continued, in an
awed tone. Goes to church twice on Sunday and
to meetings during the week.”
“ And this saint married you ?”
“He did.”
“ I don’t know which of you has my sympathy,”
Lenton commented.
“ He thinks I’m simply an angel,” Kitty con-
tinued, “ and I’ve been striving to live up to that
reputation. It has been a terrible strain.”
“But what's all this got to do with those
sketches?”
“O, Freddy, I must have them. It’s vital !
I’m always thinking that something dreadful
might happen that would lead to his seeing them.
It would be too terrible. The shock might kill
him, and he has only a life interest in the greater
portion of his estate.”
Lenton looked at his visitor steadily for a few
moments.
“Kitty,” he began slowly, like a Judge pro-
nouncing sentence, “ your story does you credit.
It is decidedly ingenious. Will Ibe forgiven if I
venture to doubt its veracity ? ”
For answer Kitty deftly peeled the glove from
her left hand.
“ Behold the band of bondage,” she commanded,
extending her third finger.
“That looks convincing,” Lenton was forced to
admit; “ but it shows how worthless are a
woman’s promises. Once you swore that your
love for me would be unchanging and eternal.”
“But you forget, dear boy,” Kitty hastened to
remind him, “ that my rashness on that occasion
can be explained by my youth; Also please re-
member that the provisions of your rich uncle’s
will were at that period still a' part of the in-
definite future. Neither was l. then aware that
he disapproved of your alleged artistic career, nor
had he died and left you richer to the extent of
one shilling.”
“Your reasons are devoid of reason,” Lenton
commented.
“ Say rather,” Kitty advised, “ that you fail to
realise the tremendous influence that the reading
of a will can exercise over a woman’s affections.”
Lenton reached toward the tobacco jar.
“ What seductive art led you into the by-ways
of matrimony ? ” he inquired.
“ I suppose you would call it yellow magic,”
was the answer.
“ If at any time you should feel that I can help
you to be glad, don’t spare me,” Lenton offered.
Kitty took up her sunshade and began to trace'
figures upon the floor.
“ May I take advantage of that promise now ? ”
she inquired, looking up suddenly.
“ I think so.”
“Then you’d better let me have those" sketches
at once.”
Lenton strode across and took them out of the
portfolio stand. A great light came into his eyes
as he looked upon them.
“Kitty!” he cried, turning to the woman,
“they’re simply great. The best things I ever
did. What are your intentions concerning
them ? ”
“ I haven’t decided, but I had thought of keep-
ing them.”
Lenton pondered.
“It's too risky,” he decided. “He might
stumble across them some day. What do you say
to a burnt offering ? ”
“ That’s the very idea ! ” Kitty replied, her eyes
dancing.
So Lenton stoked up the fire and brought out
two glasses and a bottle of red wine. Thus, with
due ceremony, the sketches were one by one re-
duced to harmless ashes. Ultimately Kitty arose
to go.
“Freddy,” she said, as she toyed with the
tassel of her sunshade. “I can rely on you?
Remember that the past lies buried and that the
future is before. The future is my only chance,
and you must absolutely forget the past. Remem-
ber, before aught else, that I am highly respect-
able.”
When Kitty took her departure Lenton
watched her from the window until she disap-
peared down the street. Then, scowling a little,
he turned toward the fire to have his gaze sud-
denly arrested by a dull gleam of light from the
throne. It came from Kitty’s purse. Lenton
picked it up. It was of an uncommon and
original design, mounted in gold and heavily
jewelled.
“She seems to have fallen on her feet with a
vengeance,” he mused, turning the purse over in
his hand. “ I’m rather glad she left this behind,”
he went on, “ for it means that she will call again.
Her story is interesting.”
Then he threw the jewelled thing into one of
the drawers of a small cabinet.
Early that evening there came a knock upon
Lenton’s door, and when the artist answered it a
cry of astonishment broke from him.
“ Where have you sprung from ?” he demanded
of the man who came through the doorway.
“ Must be two months since I saw you. In fact,
I’d given you up as being most probably dead
and buried by this time.”
“It’s much worse than that,” the newcomer
said, mournfully.
“Much worse?” Lenton repeated interroga-
tively, as he kicked a chair round toward the fire
and drew a screen across to break the draught
from the door.
“ I’m married,” the other explained as l}e sank
into the chair.
Lenton glared at him fixedly.
“Charlie Seaton,” the artist began, but the
other interrupted him with a languid gesture.
“I’ve been in the realms of bondage six weeks,”
he drawled ; “doomed to smoke in secret during
stolen intervals, and .always in deadly fear of de-
tection. Roll me 50 cigarettes that I may enjoy
a smoke in comfort, and for the love of Heaven
revive me with a whisky and soda.”
“Why did you escape to-night ?” Lenton asked
when Seaton’s wants had been partly attended to.
“ I simply couldn’t stand it any longer,” Seaton
declared, “ Six weeks of stolen smokes and empty
pretence is more than flesh and blood can stand.
Marriage is a failure absolute. I am willing to
believe in any substitute you can name. Free
love or any other recently patented institution.”
“ Never thought you believed in anything else,”
Lenton told him.
“ It’s not that I blame my wife,” Seaton went
on, wisely ignoring his friend’s interruption, “for
she’s an angel. Her innocence of the world in
general often appals me. She is desperately

Spring Skin-Troubles Banished.
With the approach of Spring do you find little rough
patches on your forehead, or cheek, or chin? Has your
skin a curious “tight” feeling? Are your hands or
finger=ends sore ? Is your skin, because of its burden
of impurity, disfigured by nasty pimples, boils,
abscesses, or eruptions ? Have you a raw, tender
feeling where your skin creases—or are you very liable
to chafing about the neck ?
These “danger signals,” which constitute the first
signs of an unhealthy skin, should never be neglected.
Following in their train are all the tortures of fiery
eczema, wide=reaching blood poison, and ulcerous sores.
Nothing is more important than the way we should treat
this skin disease. It is not the slightest use relying upon any
internal remedy or external application if these do not reach
the impurity itself, which is the cause of the disorganisation
in our delicate and intricate tissues. Cheap and coarse ointments
and so-called blood-mixtures may make eczema “slumber”
awhile, but the disease soon breaks forth in all its “ fire ” and
itching irritation, for the root-evil has not been touched.
Zam-Buk, because of its absolute purity, is the ideal Spring
skin-balm. Zam-Buk is So refined that the tissues absorb it
readily; and its medicinal essences at once attack .the disease
below the surface. Wherever the skin has been injured by
accident or eaten by disease, Zam-Buk promotes the growth of
new and healthy tissues in a quick and marvellous manner.
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM=BUK.
Mr. H. Christie, of 16 London Street, Enmore, Sydney, says:—“l was
troubled with boils, and tried all manner of things to get rid of them, but to
no avail. Seeing Zam-Buk advertised as a cure, I procured a pot, and applied
it as directed, with the pleasing result that the boils .had entirely dis-
appeared after three days’ treatment.”

effort. You knbw the rate I’ve lived at.”
‘‘lt would put an express train to shame,”
Lenton assured him.
“ I only got out to-night,” Seaton went on, “ by
pretending I had to attend a special church
meeting.”
Lenton groaned, and Seaton grew more and
more despondent. The cigarettes continued to
consume themselves in his mouth with wondrous
regularity.
“I smoke in secret,” he murmured, “for she
thinks me a non-smoker and a teetotaler. I
deceive her daily. lam unworthy of her.”
Seaton’s state of utter dejection began to get on
Lenton’s nerves. It made him angry.
“Why on earth did you marry her?” he
demanded.
“The purity of her soul fascinated me,” was
the answer.
“It’s a wonder such a novelty didn’t frighten
you out of your seven senses,” Lenton remarked ;
but Seaton continued to look like a condemned
criminal awaiting execution.
“ Why did she marry you?” Lenton inquired
after a time. “ Your money fascinated her soul,
I suppose ? ”
“She does not know that I am wealthy,”
Seaton told him.
“My boy,” was Lenton’s rejoinder, “you have
money, and if it is a mere woman you have
married, she’ll know it.”
“Then there’s the possibility that she may
make other discoveries concerning me ? ”
“ I should certainly think it probable with such
a prolific past to dig in.”
Seaton roused himself.
“ If my wife were to learn the truth about my
past it would kill her,” he said.
" What other blessing would you prefer?” his
friend asked.
“ Your confession is a warning,” he continued,
after a pause. “From now on my motto will be, '
‘ Don’t marry a Soul.’ The fact is, your case gives
the lie direct to the old yarn about opposites
marrying. It’s all a fake. I know the girl you
should have married. An old model of mine.
Has been on the stage and has seen life, with a
big L. A sparkling girl. She finds herself in the
same box as you. Has married a fellow for his
money, only to discover that he's a very pious
individual who lives chiefly on church meetings.
He thinks she’s an angel, and she’s been trying to
live up to it. She’s about as much suited to wings
as you are. Still she was after cash, and judging
by the purse she left behind when she was here
to-day she’s got it. I must let you see the purse ;
it’s a wonderful piece of work.”
Lenton crossed to the cabinet. The drawer had
jammed, and while he was coaxing it open there
came a faint knock upon the door. Lenton hur-
riedly dragged out the obstinate drawer, took out
the purse, and tossed it round one end of the
screen to Seaton.
“Have a look at that while I see who this is,”
be said.
Lenton opened the door, and the light fell full
upon Kitty. The artist started back.
“ I’ve lost my purse,” Kitty began, breathlessly.
“Did I leave it here? My husband went out to a
church meeting to-night, so I came across in the
car. He gave me that purse, and I don’t want
him to miss it. He’s so suspicious.”
By this time Lenton had recovered from the
shock of seeing her.
“You’re the very tonic I’m looking for,” he
declared. “ Come in.”
“ I can’t stay,” Kittv protested as she stepped
inside.
“I wish to introduce you to a friend,” Lenton
continued. “You will be able to cheer him up.
He’s like you. Married to an angel, who thinks
he’s ditto, while really he’s the greatest,scapegoat
ever born. Like you, he’s been acting till he’s
tired. He made good his escape this evening, and
came round to have a smoke in comfort.”
While these words were being spoken Seaton,
hidden entirely from view, was sitting behind the
screen gazing like a hypnotised being at the purse
in his hand.
“ Didn’t you see anything of my purse?” Kitty
asked, as Lenton closed the door.
When that question fell upon his ears Seaton
sprang out from the shelter of the screen. Like a
wild animal brought suddenly to bay, he glared
for an instant at Kitty ; then his whole body went
limp and his face grew grey. Kitty’s features
took on a strained and startled look. With one
hand still upon the door, Lenton glanced inquir-
ingly from the man to the woman.
“ My wife ! ” Seaton muttered, huskily.
“Good God !” Lenton ejaculated.
JOHN PATRICK.
A Hit on the Head.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
HENERY —all the neighbors called
him Henery—was a fool. He got some
sort of a living working on the neighbor-
ing farms, and his usual tenure of office at each
place was one calendar month. No establishment
could support Henery for longer than four weeks
at one sitting, because, by the end of that time,
he generally had the place wrecked. Then he
would be given a week’s wages in lieu of notice,
and driven off with more or less hostility. In
about a year or so, when everything had been
repaired and old disasters forgotten, he would
be taken on again, and once more the work of de-
struction would commence and proceed to the
usual climax. Henery’s mother, who was a weep-
ing widow, followed always in Henery’s wake.
Her mission in life was to explain Henery.
She never quite succeeded, but the point
on which she used to lay the greatest stress was
that Henery had once got a hit on the head when
he was young. The explanation used to be
handed round, and thereafter, whenever Henery
distinguished himself, somebody would announce
the reason. “’E can’t ’elp it! ’E got a’it on
th’ ’ead w’en ’e was young.” Sometimes as. many
as three people said it together.
The old residents of the district stuck loyally to
Henery, and among them kept him fairly em-
ployed for many years, during which time Henery
became, if anything, worse. Up to the day he
was forty-three he had smashed, burnt and
destroyed more property than three bush-fires and
two droughts. The only return the countryside
got for all this was the remark about the hit on
the head.
But on the day he was forty-three Henery
entered into the service of the latest arrival in the
district, an Irishman named Rafferty. He cele-
brated the occasion by carelessly dropping a pipe-
light, whereby he made a bonfire of five acres of
grass, two new harvesters and some odds and
ends of fencing. When the blaze had been beaten
out, Rafferty chased him for two miles with an
axe-handle, imploring him all the way to stop and
be murdered.
When Henery arrived home and related the
incident, Henery’s mother set out for Rafferty’s
with the intention of telling Rafferty the usual
thing. She found Henery’s late employer, con-
siderably singed, superintending the ruins.
Rafferty listened with reasonable patience until
she handed out the time-worn excuse, but at that
he went mad. “ A hit on th ’ head ! ” he roared,
‘‘ a hit on th’ head whin he was young, is ut ? Be
th’ piper that played before Moses, it’ll be nothin’
t’ th’ hit on th’ head he’ll get whin he’s owld, if
Oi get within a moile av him ! Go away, me
good woman, an’ if ye’ve any further use f’r that
divil av yours, kape him out av my soight f’r th’
rist av his days! Go away an’ don’t come
botherin’ me whin it’s rooined Oi am ! ”
Henery never went back to Rafferty’s.
KODAK.
The Rejected Authors’ Club.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
worms may turn —to vipers,
There are bounds set to all gripers
Of the Chance —from kings to swipers
In a pub.
Certain gentlemen respected
In this town, and well-connected,
Have established The Rejected
Authors’ Club.
Now, the Editor tyrannic .
Shall no more with smile Satanic—
Or perhaps in jealous panic—
Drop their screed
In his basket-grave infernal,
Wherein rest, in peace eternal,
Better things than in his journal
People read.
Let that Editorial Vulture
In his pages give sepulture
To his friends’ work ; Men of Culture
Will not care.
He no more shall bullyrag them,
Satirise and nag and scrag them—
For wild horses will not drag them
To his lair.
They have found a place of meeting
That will take a lot of beating ;
There you may, for moments fleeting,
Shoulders rub
With stout poets, rich and wary,
Who write verses light and airy—
And they’ve made me Secretary
Of the club.
Our club rooms—we’re no ascetics—
Are a lesson in aesthetics,
And our sofas are not bed-ticks
Rep-disguised.
If you saw our fine-cut glasses,
And our pictures—each first-class is—
You would be—and this no gas is—
Much surprised.
In our club there are no needy
Bards or storytellers seedy,
Who demand with voices greedy
Coin or gore—
No poor devils who with scowling
Brows write love-songs, while the prowling
Wolf of Hunger comes a-howling
To their door.
If with us you chanced to mingle,
It would make your pulses tingle
Just to hear the joyful jingle
Of the coin
In our pockets—that’s a chiming
That is better than your rhyming,
And your poor Parnassus climbing—
Will you join?
We have members in full measure :
Men of business and of pleasure,
Who in quiet hours of leisure
Court the Muse.
Some are big men in the city,
Yet can write you poems pretty,
Or a sweet decadent ditty,
When they choose.
And our Chairman is a German ;
He’s a firm man and a fair man,
And to quell a row a rare man—
Six foot tall.
When he brings down his small hammer
There is then an end to clamour,
And disputes on style and grammar—
Once for all.
Lord ! ’Tis good to see their apers—
Bankers, brewers, wholesale drapers,
And proprietors of papers
(Keep it dark !)
Who, o’er pen-names, write spring verses,
Which their Editors, with curses,
Chuck into their wicker hearses—
What a lark !
And they do not write their stellar
Compositions in a cellar,
But each bard and story-teller
Sits down square
By a bottle of best claret,
And cigars of nineteen carat—
Which you don’t get in a garret,
I can swear.
From a banker up in Warwick
We’ve an epic allegoric,
Full of color and caloric
Upon Loans;
And an ode lies on our table
On the subject of the cable
Written by an author able—
Name of Jones.
Yes, our club holds up its head—there
Are some very fine things read there,
And fine literature bred there —
Words that burn,
And no editors shall get them.
Though the want of them should fret them,
If they pine and sicken —let them,
It’s their turn.
