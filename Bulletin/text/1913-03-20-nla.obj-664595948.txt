whitens the teeth so wonderfully, and wards
off decay as no other preparation for the

The Place Poem
There are 46 places in Australia, anc
none in Maonland, which at least one patri
otic bard has thought worth while celebrat
ing m verse. Each of the following place
boasts two poets apiece: Castlemaine
agga, Broken Hill and Mount Gambier
Either these are remarkably poetical places
or they are inhabited chiefly by noets.
Despite the repeated warnings, many of th
place-poems are purely topographical. Th
poet laureate of Gunbar is patriotic and pre
cise: Of all the places I have been, be they
near or far, no place on earth I’ve ever seen
he tells us, “is the equal of Gunbar.” Also
it s on the road from Carrathool, and 6(
miles from Hay,” and, finally, it is “on the
map of the Mother State, a part of New
South Wales.”
Where the poet has been cunning enough
to impart a human interest to his descrip
tive matter, he succeeds better. The crude
way is to work off the topography first, and
“ th ® last . stanza, lightly add the
George Scott’s “Hamil
ton-on-Forth” (Tas.) :
Dear old houses! dear old wood bridge!
Dear old gum-trees evergreen !
I can see thee from that hill ridge,
But—with blinding tears between !
Another method is to stress the nata
interest, as Blac-kboy” does for “Wyalong”
I ve tramped the towns Australian,
_ I’ve camped both east and west;
I’ve tramped on highways alien,
But love Australia best.
Through districts celebrated
In story and in song,
My wander-lust is sated.
You’ll do me, Wyalong.
• bi £ th ~P lace interest is better stressed
in Ben Sun’s’ “Castlemaine”:—
Ay, Castlemaine, I’ve wandered since around the
world a bit,
Had good hnd bad and doubtful luck, but never
grovelled low,
For in my veins there is the blood, and in my heart
the grit,
That won you from the wilderness, a-down the
years to go.
And always, whether up or down, in triumph or
despair,
In heights of sweetest pleasure, or in throes of
poignant pain,
My mind reverting to the past divided aye its
care:
One thought for selfish ends and aims, and two for
Castlemaine.
And at the end he asks Destiny for this
simple Australian boon :
Yet once again the winding streets and grand old
hills to view,
And in its own good ale to pledge success to
Castlemaine.
“H.R.8.” loves his “Broken Hill,” with a
love that can contemplate her death. His
verse too often drops into the commonplace,
but his concluding stanzas are on a higher
plane:—
But not for ever shall Pactolus flow;
Ourselvek may sleep here when its dust shall fail:
And yet our dust, well-laid, will lie too low
To swell the burden of the passing gale;
Ere long our works, our very place, shall be
To children’s children but a memory.
Sturt peas will blossom ’neath the quandong trees
When Broken Hill is buried out of mind ;
And camel fleets will tack across the seas
Of grey-blue salt-bush, when the unresting grind
Of tube-mills dies; and always will remain
‘The fascination of the rolling plain.
The home instinct, too, is nicely stressed,
though in commonplace words, in the un-
identified “Our Place” of “6 Tooth” :
What worlds of quiet comfort there
When scorching summer’s day has passed!
Or, winter’s night, from fireside chair
To hearken to the south wind’s blast!
When all the -bairns are fast asleep,
And she, who tends them through the day,
Lists to our drone of wool or sheep,
While busy fingers mend away!
A flat—a house in town—for some I
For me—with her—Our Place is Home!
Personification adds another interest. A
fair example is “R.’s” “Townsville,” of
which the first verse is the best:—
I bring the dower of fruit or flower
Of rain-fed forest and dell,
But, strong in my right to stem the night
Of ail the winds of Hell,
I cling with pride to my brown hill-side
Ana sleep in the sun right well.
But solely by the descriptive method the
pobtic imaginaf’ >n may make something even
of Broken H.U. Thus R. J. Cassidy, in a
poem too long here to quote, reserved for
possible future publication, in fine phrases
indicates the magic of the Hill. It is the
best of the purely descriptive verses sent in,
but it lacks that htiman touch that lifts
verse into poetry. It is objective, not sub-
jective: a place seen, 1 not felt.
There is room, too, for humor in a place-
poem. Here are two examples :
OUR COW YARD.
A swamp before—a cemet’ry behind,
Between the two our humpy rears its head.
We rise before the dawn by kerosene,
And just before the dawn we go to bed.
We milk 100 cows—and as the last
Gives down .her milk and lurches from the pen
We head ’em off the pasture—for it’s time
To start and milk the - cows again.
The scenery. 0 Hell! who’s got the time?
But if you want the details in a poem,
The cow shed’s built of iron and 6x3;
Outside the shed the soil’s a heavy loam ;
Inside the shed there’s bails and wooden stools ;
Around the shed the fence is six foot high
While underfoot most everything is mud.
And up above —why, there’s the sky.
D. D. D. MACKINNON.
THE TOWN OF NOTHING IN PARTICULAR.
‘Twas most ambiguous and crude—
Implying blankness, Nature nude,
A vacuum in desuetude—
And little short of beastly rude
To label thus a neighborhood—
Nothing !
The object, Heaven—Goodness knows,
A district fair to diagnose
By what it wears or wins or owes,
And then, in very vulgar prose
A title trite like this impose—
Nix !
But still they did, and so until
The Judgment Morning, grey and chill,
W r hen Gabriel, as waiters will,
Presents, with frill, his little bill.
The borough will be branded ill—
Nought!
It happened thus (and hence my bliss)
Some wanted “that” and others “this.”
(In nomenclature what’s amiss.
No need to practice artifice.)
And so they billed the village this—
Cipher!
Though not indicative of much
Except the footprint of a crutch,
A void, hiatus, hole or such
Which echoes neither “Bake—!” or “Butch
Of genius it was a touch—
Nil!
No other place would rear or snort,
Or say the Solons here had sought
To borrow brains, or thieve its thought
With wrath no rival town was wrought.
All they could say was—well, in short,
Nhill!
A. E. B. WOOD.
There are left for final adjudication four
poems. . “White Timber,” by L. Kenny, is
purely descriptive, though written charm-
ingly, and the poet does not sign the blank
cheque of the first stanza:—
And I will sing of Gippsland
With gullies green and cool,
Where winds a play-trod pathway
Beside an old bush school.
“Devonport,” by May Rankin, is also de-
cnptlve, but with a human longing in it
that almost makes it lyric:—
DEVONPORT.
Blew ye now by Devonport,
Seawind of the South?
I can feel the kiss of her
Salt upon my mouth!
I can see the face of her
Rose against the morn;
Dales and downs of Devonport
White with budding thorn.
Sunset flame on headlands dun,
Beaches’ driven snow,
Rockpool gates of Wonderland
Where the sea-blooms blow;
Wild-rose stars against the cliff
Scenting every breeze....
Wind that blew by Devonport,
Whisper me of these!
Blown brown sails against the blue,
Wheeling wings of grey,
Sense of her and soul of her,
Weary years away ;
Oh, they leap to life again,
Gleaming fold and fold,
Dales and downs of ‘Devonport,
Lit with rose and gold!
MAY RANKIN.
So there are two poems, each suffused with
emotion, each hinting of the soul, and not
the bones, of a place, each depending for
its appeal on its mere name and the
poignancy of the memories of the writers.
The subject of each has been lifted from a
mere place to an emotional influence. One
is written by a girl who apologises “for any
mistakes or foolishness in the verses or the
(covering) letter on account of my youth
and inexperience,” but the anatomical' divi-
sion of her heart in the last stanza, and her
obvious groping for rimes, leaves her second
in the competition, though, as always, all
poems quoted fully here are paid for at space
rates. The winner is Marie E. J. Pitt, to
whom one guinea has been sent.
KARRLA HILL.
There are little birds that sing from tree to tree on
Karela.
In my dreams I hear them sing from tree to tree
In the branches where they swing so merrily—
But, ah me!
I may never seek the shadow of a tree on Karela
(Oh, the coolness of the shadow of a tree I)
There are little furry rabbits in the grass on Karela,
And I know just how they’re running through the
grass,
Or'they’re hiding from the shadow-clouds that pass—
Biit, alas!
I may never set my feet among the grass on Karela !
(Oh, the silver shine and shadow of the grass!)
On thy silver elope is buried half my heart, 0
Karela,
And the other half is drifting on the breeze
Where it swings among the branches of thy trees.
Though the seas '
Of adversity have held us far apart, 0 Karela,
Still thy silver shine and shadow holds my heart.
VICTORIA.
PATRICIA MURCHISON.
MATHINNA.
Ah, woe the day! And woe the day,
Betwixt the golden and the gray,
And woe the star that set for aye —
My star of dream — Mathinna!
I saw the lone moon lift her lamp,
I saw the white star-sentries tramp;
But far, far was the stranger's camp
By glen and gorge, by fell and swamp —
Far. far thy hills, Mathinna.
1 saw the dawn leap from his bed.
All wild and red and thunder-fed,
Rehind Ben Lomond's purple head
And the mountains —and Mathinna!
I saw the ragged red sun rise
And climb the steel stairs of the shies,
Like blood between mine aching eyes
And the mountains —and Mathinna.
I saw the thin road wind away,
A single thread of dusty grey,
Into the heart of burning day;
And my heart went with it all the way
To the mountains —and Mathinna.
I turned me from the mountains tall;
Behind me distance built her wall;
But still I hear thee call and call —
The sweetest, saddest voice of all —
/ hear thee call, Mathinna.
Yea, one sweet song will come to me
Where’er on earth my home shall be,
A song of all wild things and free,
The song that was the soul of thee,
Wild soul of song, Mathinna!
Dust is the white rose by the door,
And dust the scarlet poppy's core,
But thou wilt breathe for evermore
On winds of some enchanted shore —
Red rose of dreams-—Mathinna!
TASMANIA.
MARIE E. J. PITT.
Swinburne
Swinburne passes. His death in 1909
leaves him rather a curiosity than a force in
English literature. His biographer, Edward
Thomas, in Algernon Swinburne, a Critical
Study, in the fine series of biographies pub-
lished by Martin Seeker ( per Dymock’s
Library, Sydney), is more critical than
enthusiastic. His meticulous analysis of
Swinburne’s use of words damningly reveals
the mechanism that produced such sonorous
sound—and some poetry :
“Fire” and “light,” “bright” and “shine,”
with “desire” and “high” and “sky,” and
other words which their vowel sound and
Swinburne’s usage make cognate are master
words in his poetry. It can almost be said
that >he never writes one of those words
without repeating it or matching it with one
of the others The repetition—repetition
of single vowels or consonant sounds, of
single words, of groups of words, of ideas:
whether always conscious or not, these are
essentials in Swinburne’s art.... Since the
adjective is most ready when words are
wanted he used a great number, yet without
equally great variety. He kept as it were a
harem of words, to which he was constant
and absolutely faithful. Some he favored
more than others, but he neglected none.
He used them more often out of compliment
than of necessity.. ..
Yet the poet’s rhythm was sufficient tri-
umphantly to sweep the verbiage of his words
along:—
But Swinburne had almost no magic
facility of words. He can astonish and melt
but seldom thrill, and when he does it is
not by any felicity of as it were God-given
inevitable words. He has to depend on
sound and an atmosphere of words which is
now and then concentrated and crystallised
into an intensity of effect which is almost
magical, perhaps never quite magical. The
atmosphere comes from a vocabulary very
rich in words connected with objects and
sensations and emotions of pleasure and
beauty, but used somewhat lightly and even
in appearance indiscriminately. No poet
could be poorer in brief, electric phrases,
pictorial or emotional Perhaps the great-
est of his triumphs is in keeping up a stately
solemn play of words not unrelated to the
object suggested by his title and commence-
ment, but more closely related to rimes, and
yet in the end giving a compact and power-
ful impression. The play of words often on
the very marge of nonsense has acted as an
incantation, partly by pure force of cadence
and kiss of rhymes, partly by the accumula-
tive force of words in the right key, though
otherwise lightly used. Hardly one verse
means anything in particular, hardly one
line means anything at all, but nothing is
done inconsistent with the opening, nothing
which the _ rashest critic would venture to
call unavailing in, the complete effect.
And Edward Thomas adds that in some of
his poems. “English words sang together as
before 1866 they had never done,” and in
some others “the riming words have a life of
their own, as of birds singing or fauns danc- '
ing.”
I’oqm after poem is worth much or
nothing, according as the reader can take the
first line or verse as a keynote and then
allow the, metre to sing, with occasional
guidance from the words “light,” “men,”
“sea,” “thundering,” “sleep,” “weep,”
“sword,” “grave,” “time,” “crown,” etc. Not
that they are to be regarded as majestic
nonsense rimes, for they treat grave matters
gravely and grammatically.... It is not
thought set to music, but mnsm
absorbed thought. .. .In “A
sage” there is* fflSfrlt ’ as '

poetical in an omnibus ; but being noeti^ I*B 1 * 8

that they love men and Nature Sr e C
S 3& 0t Sw, " b “™ * loved' 83
Equally detailed is his biographer’s an
alysis of Swinburne’s prose—but then Swin
ourne could not write prose.
Of the man, Edward Thorns
supplies a gallery of portraits. One comnl
site portrait shows him as a noticeably stn a n
man with a “glorious abundance” of '“fiery”
or “reddish yellow” or “orange” hair and
blue-grey or ‘clear green” eyes softened
by thick brown lashes. When he was reneat-
>ug poetry and apparently lie was nearly
always repeating poetry—his head hung ™
one side, his body shook, his high-pitched
voice expressed the utmost fervor and excite-
ment. Also, he might “jump about the room
in a manner somewhat embarrassing to the
listener.” He was always restless; his walk
was a dance. Another picture shows'him as
a short man with a cranium out of all pre-
portion to the rest of the structure, an enor-
mous head with too small a chin. He was
never known to complain of fatigue, of a
toothache or of a headache, he required very
little sleep, and out of doors he was “like
something blown before a wind,” having the
movements of a somnambulist.
This is a penetrating biography, composed
by a cold, logical mind—the last sort of mind
that the. poet would have chosen for the task
Edward Thomas’s niggard praise has, h«w-
ever, more value than mere superlatives.
An Australian Literary Shrine
. “Fox” suggests, chiefly for scenic reasoas
the humpy of the late George Essex Evans:
Re the advertisement appearing in
the wanted column of the “Red Page,” call-
ing for literary shrines, I recommend one—the
home of the late poet, George Essex Evans.
Evans’s works require no testimonial. The
house under mention is situated on the Main
Range (Great Dividing), Toowoomba (Q.),
about two-thirds of the way down on the
road to Brisbane, called by Toowoombaites
the Toll Bar-road. This spot is just
far enough out of the town of Toowoomba
to make a visit to it an excursion. Half a
day could easily be put in journeying to and
from the cottage and viewing the sights, v
The shrine proposed would have the fol-
lowing advantage over its fellow or rival
shrines. The scene from the top of the
Range is one of striking loveliness. Stretch-
ing away below the Range as far as the
vision can penetrate are cultivated farms,
patches of scrub, timbered and open plains,
mountain ranges, and isolated houses; and in
the middle distance is the town of Helidon,
the whole commingling to the satisfaction
of the eye. All is wrapped in a blue, misty
atmosphere that gives the far-off landscape
a sea-like appearance.
On the slopes of the Range itself is still
the forest primeval. In the immediate
foreground are Table Top and one or two
other solitary crags. Table Top is an in-
sulated mountain with a roof like to a bowl-
ing green. No tree adorns its grassy head,
but its sides are clothed w(th timber and
decked with giant boulders. Altogether it is
a dignified and impressive mount. At our
backs lies Toowoomba, surrounded by the
diversified greens of small cultivations.
The Toowoomba people are erecting a
monument to Evans’s memory in Webb
Park, on the top of the Range. I think,
however, it is preferable to pay homage to
the departed bard at his erstwhile residence
than at the foot of a piece of monumental
masonry that Evans never saw.
Wanted: A Sonnet on the Federal Capital
Now that the Federal Capital is named, it
becomes a fit —though rather dry, if not
parched—subject for the Australian poet.
This page offers fl Is. for the best sonnet
received, addressed to this page, by April 30.
The sonnet may be complimetary or condem-
natory, topographical or prophetical, but it
must be in the strict sonnet form. To lines
1,4, 5, 8 there must be only one rime, and
lines 2,3, 6, 7 must also all rime to one
sound. The sestette may have two or three
rimes, but must not end in a riming couplet.
Also, it is suggested that the whole 14 lines
should be poetry, or thereabouts.
— 'f
In these days of solemn reviews, a wel-
come is readily extended to a freak magazine,
entitled Rhythm (Seeker, Is., monthly).
Here you have “precious” stories, mad cari-
catures, and the cult of the triumphant post-
impressionist. Of this new art we learn that
“Post-Impressionist works are hung at all
the chief exhibitions on the Continent:
names of P.-I. painters are becoming as well-
known as those of the Academicians. It is
becoming increasingly evident that youth is
with the new movement: that the vital work
of the day is being done by young men who
are under the P.-I. influence.” It is evi-
dently time for Australian artists to get a
hustle on.

ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT
(Lister-Bruston System—Patented).
This plant generates electricity automatically, and does away with large and
expensive storage battery. Can be started from drawing-room or bedroom.
With the exception of keeping the plant clean, lubricating and filling the
tanks, no attention is required.
Upon switching on the lights the plant works, and when the lights are turned
off the plant stops automatically.
The set is self-contained, and is delivered ready to work. No erection or
foundations necessary; all one has to do is to connect to the wires to the house,
shop, hall, hotel, or town lights, and fill up the tanks with oil. It is exceptionally
cheap as regards lighting costs, the user being able to enjoy all the many advantages
of electric light, at a rate per candle power cheaper than most systems of petrol
gas, acetylene, and other artificial lights, and have current always ready for lights,
fans, cooking, pumps, saws, separators, milking and chaffcutting, sewing and other
machines.
Is absolutely safe and reliable; no smell or fumes, dirt or smoke.
LET US SEND YOU FULLER DETAILS.
Made in Sizes from 20 to 5000 LIGHTS.

IN “ Viyella ” we have a first-class material for family use.
Its appearance is decidedly nice, its texture light and
soft, and its service enduring. It is a hygienic fabric,
being of such a porous nature as to allow free air circulation,
and at the same time preserve the body at a normal tem-
perature. Its softness makes it desirable to the tenderest
skin ; even baby may wear “ Viyella ” with comfort.
The fact that it is unshrinkable will appeal to every
housewife, as the shrinking tendencies of many otherwise
good materials is a source of continual worry in the home.
The special nature of the yarn from which “ Viyella ”
is made guarantees the durability of the fabric. Ideal for
Ladies’ Blouses, Nightdresses and Undergarments ; Men’s
Sh irts and Pyjamas ; and Children’s brocks, Nightdresses
and Underclothing.

THE TOILERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It is solid graft.”— Volunteer’s opinion of gas-
making.
With sweat and toil the world goes round,
And labor, like a hungry bear,
In nearly every spot is found
Waiting to catch us unaware;
We mostly find it worth our while
To take our punishment and smile.
The wheels must turn, the ships must go,
The paper must be sent to press;
We must have certain coins to show
When Mabel wants another dress,
And so we take the shortest way
To grip the world and make it pay.
But every fellow looks to see
The way the other earns his bread,
And, as a rule, it seems that he
Should change and take our job instead ;
For from our special point of view
He gets the easy things to do.
The man who needs must use his brain
Till all his nerves are worn and thin,
Is envied by the men who gain
A living teaching wheels to spin,
Or lumping coals, or chopping wood,
Or chasing bulls with hardihood.
The man who, near to Nature’s heart,
Rides round the brown and dusty run,
Is envied by the man of art
His splendid bronzing in the sun;
He thinks that he would freely change
His easel for a mountain range.
And they who with especial skill
May dodge the common lot of man,
And sit aloof, remote and still,
Because in cash their days began,
Are apt to find their golden shirk
Uncommonly like solid work.
Therefore in toil I set my trust,
And with a mad, unresting pen
String rhymes together for a crust
And envy not my brother men;
For all they do and all they think
I mix with music, mirth and ink.

GEORGE STREET.
“Box 2459” (from Johannesburg) : “Splodger”
(B. 19/12/’l2), talking about the cost of living in
early Coolgardie, mentions G. H. Kingswell’s emo-
tion when confronted with a certain elongated ac-
count. Kingswell is here in Johannesburg, where he
manages, part owns, and is everything that is worth
talking about in connection with the Sunday Times,
a large, weighty 40-page Sabbath paper, which is
now filling its spare columns with squeals anent the
Betting Bill, a measure which was given its kick
off by the Crimes. L. R. McLeod, who edited the
Crimes for a couple of years after the christening,
seceded to start the Observer —an alleged copy of
The Bulletin. The parody had its last forme
locked exactly 12 moons after birth; it was then
metamorphosed into a second Sunday organ, labelled
the Sunday Post, and it appears to be more than
holding its own.
* * * *
Frank Whitcombe, who not long ago joined the
staff of Melbourne Herald, is not one of vour nar-
row-circle, small-range men. An Englishman by
birth, he was young and married when the Chicago
big fire burnt him out. He set to work naintinrr «,
titbits of the ruins, and sold his picturettes on an
ascending scale from the price of chops to the nri™
of joints. Presently, coming to Australia he tmt
on the staff of Melbourne Evening Standard and
wrote a few one-act plays which were professionally
performed, and had some success. When the Stanti
ard followed many bright papers on the drearv
to the devil ‘‘Whit” retired to his fannlet between
Brighton and Caulfield. A year or two later he was
dragged on to Nathaniel Levi’s Evening News
When the News crumbled, he started farming exten’'
sively in East Gippsland, and kept it going for
several years, writing at odd times for the Argus and
others. Now, he is back once more to staff wort ■
but no “duty book” can ever deaden his pen. " ’
* * *
Pensioned off by Melbourne Herald, as a reward
for years of service whereof the memory of man ex
tendeth not to the contrary, “Jim” Middleton at last
lays down the pen that was nearly always a pencil
Formerly editor of the paper, Middleton has like
Mulvaney with the Oul Regiment, seen its personnel
change, “not wanst, nor twice, but scores av times ”
His strongest point was law-court reporting, all in
longhand. Give Middleton a soft pencil, a ’wad of
copy-paper and a big, joyful case, and he would turn
out three and four columns a day in a style that
would tax many a Pitmanite to equal. Failin»-
health drove him from the Inky Way.
It was at the old Melbourne Immigrants’ Home
adjoining the Alexandra Gardens—an ancient build'
ing that is now about to perish—that Julian Thomas
earned his pen-name of “The Vagabond.” lie vaga-
bonded there for a night or two, and made his earlv
literary splash out of the copy thus collected. In
like manner Greenwood became “The Amateur
Casual” through trying the casual ward of a British
workhouse in quest of copy. But Greenwood encoun-
tered bitter cold, skilly, vermin, a hard bed, stone-
breaking at daylight, and the vile abuse of a Bumble
dressed in a cocked hat and a shred of brief authority.
He earned his designation at much greater cost than
Julian Thomas.
“J.F.H.”: Passed away J. W. Arrowsmith, of Bris-
tol, the leading English provincial publisher. His
prosperity was built up on “Called Back,” a story
written by a Bristol auctioneer named Fred Fargus
(pen-name, Hugh Conway). It was Henry Labou-
ehere, M.P., who set the boom going. He alighted
upon “Called Back” accidentally, and was so fasci-
nated by the story that he sat up till four in the
morning to finish it. When he sounded its praises in
Truth, the orders began to roll in from all quarters.
Arrowsmith had six presses running night and day,
and even then was unable to keep pace with the de-
mand. Fargus sold the copyright to Arrowsmith for
£BO, but the latter could afford to be generous, and
he gave the author thousands of pounds which he
could legally have kept for himself. It was to
Arrowsmith that Rudvard Kipling offered his first
book, “Plain Tales from the Hills,” but the Bristol
publisher did not think much of them, and declined.
He afterwards publicly proclaimed himself an idiot
for doing it.
“Penman”: If my hair did not stand on end
already, it would over the preposterous notice of
editor Windsor in the London Times. Some brilliant
hack, whose knowledge was confined to the fact that
Windsor edited the Age for 28 years, wrote what mvst
be the facts, seeing that the Times prints them,
though he is wrong in every particular. No mention,
for instance, is made of David Svme! Windsor, it
seems, with terrific energy, plumped upon the Age
when it was fearfullv low down, inaugurated the
vigorous advocacy of Protection, for which he was a
zealot, and carried it into the triumphant Australian
policy. All the politicians were afraid of him. He
virtually appointed the whole of the Victorian dele-
gates to the Convention, which framed the National
Constitution. In short, the whole life-work of aggres-
sive and masterful! David Syme is transferred to
Windsor, whose fine literary points don’t get a
word. Thus is Australia written up for England : and
the most ridiculous part of the business is that_ the
opinions of such ignoramauses on Australian subjects
are cabled to us. and we are supposed to be tremen-
dously impressed by them.

The Steam End shown in the illustra-
tion is of the “Oddesse” High Pressure
Pattern, fitted with “Oddesse” Valve
Gear, with cut-off valves, but where greater
economy in steam consumption is required
we can quote for these pumps fitted with
Compound Cylinders.
All parts of the Pump End are sub-
divided as much as possible, so that if any
part is broken accidentally, the whole of
the water end has not to be replaced, as
is often the case with cheaper pattern
pumps. The valve boxes are provided
with separate doors for access to each box.
In the smaller pumps each valve box con-
tains a single gun metal valve and seat,
and in the larger pumps we fit gun metal
group valves.
The steam and water ends are coupled
together with mild steel stanchions turned
and polished bright, and the whole forms
a very substantial arrangement.
REGULAR FITTED PUMPS have valves
and seats of gun metal, rams of hard,
close-grained cast iron, and piston rods of
steel.
GUN METAL FITTED PUMPS have gun
metal cased rams, gun metal valves and
seats, and steel piston rods.

THIKT WOME3NT !
A thin woman is not necessarily plain, let alone ugly, la
fact, many thin women possess very pretty, “sweet faces, but
this is usually admitted with the qualifying phrase, but,
poor thing, she is so dreadfully thin.’
A woman’s chief charm is a well-rounded figure and a full
bosom. With these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a rarity.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages of ill-health have
sought and accepted this advice, and to-day are models of
womanly development and examples of perfect health.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect flesh-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week.

BILIOUS SUBJECTS
are generally victims of Constipation, that root evil of so many
terrible afflictions ; but they are “ bilious subjects ” no longer when
they adopt the famous Cockle’s Antibilious Pills as the standing
household remedy, now in the
Second Century of World-Wide Renown.
Cockle’s Pills, which doctors of six generations have taught the world
to use and esteem, have no harsh, coercive action on the sluggish
they gently stimulate, soothingly strengthen and encourage, the natural
organic functions, at the same time thoroughly cleansing the system and
purifying the vital fluid. There is nothing to equal Cockle s Pills tor
this perfect cleansing, reinvigorating, purifying combination of results.
It is marvellous.

have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by

“My general health is now perfect; all my former

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Joy Ride.
Ah Gawd! It makes me sick to think
Of what I ’eard an ’ seen;
Poor ’Arry like a wet rag flung
Across the wrecked machine;
An’ Rose, ’er face all chiner-white
Against the gory green.
Now ’Arry Cox ’e drives a car
For Doctor Percy Gray.
Ses ’e to me: “On Sund’y nex’
The Doc. will be away.
’Ow is it for a little trip
To Fernville for the day?
“I know two bonzer girls,” ’e ses;
“Fair ’otties, both, they are.
There’s Rose who serves behind thG joint
In Mudge’s privit bar,
An’ Lena Crump who jerks the pump
Down at the Southern Star.”
Now, who’d refuse a Sund’y trip
With girls an’ all give in?
The car was there an’ oil to spare.
To rat would be a sin!
An’ who’d refuse a drop o’ booze
When pals is flush o’ tin?
Wot all the courts an ’ papers say
Can’t add to my distress ....
Rose, with the hlood upon ’er face
An' on ’er crumpled dress!
An’ that poor chump who got the hump —
Ah, Gawd! ’E was a mess!
The girls ’ad stout at ten mile out,
An' we was drinkin’ beer.
I swear they lies like ’ell who ses
That we was on our ear!
For we was both, I take me oath,
As sober as me here.
Now, Lena was a dashin’ piece,
’lgh-spirited an’ flash.
’Twas plain enough to me that day
That ’Arry’d done ’is dash.
An’ Rose —(Ah! how ’er eyes did stare)
Rose was my speshul mash.
It’s easy now fer folks to talk
Who might have done the same.
We meant no ’arm to anyone,
An’ ’Arry knew ’is game.
’Twas like a flash, the skid —the crash.
An’ we was not to blame.
I wislit I could shut out that sight;
Fergit that awful row!
Poor Rose! ’Er face all chiner-white,
Like I can see it now;
An’ ’Arry like a heap o’ clothes
Jist chucked there any’ow.
They ses we painted Fernville red;
They ses that we was gay;
But wot come after dulls me mind
To wot them liars say.
We never dreamed of death an’ ’ell
When we set out that day.
’Twas ev’nin’ when we turned for ’ome ;
The moon shone full that night;
An’ for a mile or more ahead
The road lay gleamin’ white;
An’ Rose sat close aside o’ me,
’Er face turned to the light.
Wot if we sung a song or two?
Wot if they ’eard us shout?
Is song an’ laughter things to curse
An’ make a fuss about?
“Go faster! faster!” Lena screams.
An’ ’Arry let ’er out.
I’d give me soul jist to ferget.
Lord! how ’er eyes did stare!
’Er kisses warm upon me lips,
I seen ’er lyin’ there,
Blood on ’er face, all chiner-white,
An’ on ’er yeller ’air.
I never took no ’eed ’o pace
(I’ve been on twenty trips),
An’ Rose was restin’ in me arms,
’Er cheek against my lips.
A precious lot I dreamed of skids,
A lot I thought o’ slips.
I only know we never thinks —
I know we never dreams
Of folk out walkin’ on that road ;
Till, sudden, Lena screams....
An’, after that, the sights I saw
I’ve seen again in dreams.
We never seen the bloke ahead!
’Ow can they call us rash?
I jist seen ’Arry move to shove
’ls arm around ’is mash;
I seen ’er jump to grab the wheel,
Then, Lord ! there came the smash !
Aw they can hlame an ’ cry their shame!
It ain’t for that I care.
I held ’er in my arms an laugnea
Then seen ’er lyin’ there,
The moonlight streamin’ on er face,
An ’ on ’er yeller hair.

The Butterfly.
At sunset came a butterfly
A-flitting through the dog-wood scrub.
I saw it as my horse went by
A flimsy grey-brown butterfly
I heard the kookaburras cry
Up where the creaking branches rub,
And then I saw the butterfly
Come flitting through the dogwood scrub.
My feet tramped on beside my horse
And creaking waggon up the hill.
I was the driver, so of course
I plodded on beside my horse.
I lost the butterfly, perforce,
Amid the sunset lights a-spill.
And so I passed, beside my horse
And creaking waggon up the hill.
vf v heart went with the butterfly,
iIf And danced beside it through thesbade.
The long, red road was hot and dry
MV heart went, with the butterfly.
The dogwood scrub was green and high,
And cool the shadow that it made.
tvtv hpart went with the butterfly,
M Ami danced beside it through the shade.

Special “HALLEY” LORRY
For Wool-Carrying and General Work
Halley Industrial Motors, Ltd., of Glasgow, Scotland, have designed a special
type of Motor-Lorry, ideally adapted for Australian needs. A model will
be shown at Dalgety’s Exhibit at the Royal Agricultural Society’s Show.
I his Lorry is the last word in Australian motor-transport, and really
demands inspection.
THE HIGH CLEARANCE, STRENGTH, and POWER, and the
sterling reliability of this Lorry enable it to operate successfully in the
roughest country.
Steel wheels and tyres of large proportions are employed. Winding
drums and patent reduction gear are fitted to the rear wheels. These
winding drums, together with a steel hawser, enable the lorry to pull itself
out of bogs, etc. They may be used also for general hoisting and loading
work.
The ground clearance is 18 inches under chain cases, and 27 inches
under rear axles and all mechanism. The front axle is pivoted at its
centre in such a way as to enable either of the wheels to pass over an object
16 inches high, without the least distortion of the frame.
To Garry 6 Tons and Trail 2 Tons
Gear Box, as in all models, is foolproof, and gives four speeds forward
and one reverse. Chains and gearing are completely enclosed in oil-tight
and dust-proof casings. Extra large radiator is fitted, ensuring perfect
cooling—also 50-gallon tank for reserve water. Petrol Tank has 25 gallons
capacity.
Any Type of Body can be Fitted
Do not fail to inspect this fine, highly-specialised model. The fullest
information will be sent, post free, to anyone unable to benefit by a personal
inspection.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-

the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/' is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE TEMPORARY CAPITAL AT
CANBERRA.
the singing of the “Old Hundredth,” the
* blare of trumpets, and the boom of cannon,
the big swindle perpetrated upon the people
of Australia, in connection with the Federal
Capital, was advanced another stage last
week. There was much congratulatory
speech-making of a very ordinary sort, and
the name Canberra was allowed to remain
as the designation of the place that is to be
built. It is a better name than “Myola” or
“Pacifica,” or any of the numerous absurdi-
ties proposed, and is large and sonorous
enough to answer its purpose. A commence-
ment column was also started, and for the
moment it may be conceded that the site
question is closed, and that some sort of a
Federal settlement will rise upon the wastes
of Canberra. Whether King O’Malley can
succeed in importing his proposed rivers
and lakes into the landscape, and creating
even on the smallest scale the city beautiful
of his dreams, is not a matter of critical
importance. The politicians of Australia
have combined to promote the construction
of an official village rather than a great
city. A place with a population of 10 or
15 thousand is likely in the near future to
drink sparingly from the Cotter trickle, and
contain the Parliament and Governor-
General at intervals. Also, it will contain
buildings, streets and parks, more or less
fashioned according to the weird taste of
O’Malley, and that is about ail that is
likely to be achieved by the long wrangle,
the columns upon columns of print that have
been devoted to the question, and all the
cannon, trumpets, speeches and other mat-
ters which marked last week’s opening dis-
play. With a firm conviction that Australia
did not know what was good for it, the
statesmen of both parties have refused to
test the opinion of the people by Referendum
on the whereabouts of the capital, and .the
foundation-stones of our first memorial of
national unity are laid in national distrust.
It does not seem an occasion for three cheers
or for one cheer, but a time for asking some
very serious questions about democracy, and
demanding a very clear answer in the near
future. If our more important national con-
cerns can be conducted without the feeling
of the people being known or asked for, our
method of government has something very
seriously wrong about it, and our foremost
need is to remove from the politicians who
are unwilling to consult the people their
right of initiative by taking that initiative
directly into the people’s own hands.
* * * *
Whatever may be said in favor of the
Canberra capital, one thing is perfectly
clear—that as a seat’ of government for this
big continent it is neither in position nor in
natural advantages the best that could have
been chosen. Australia wants the best and
only the best; and when the people are fully
alive to that fact, it is quite inconceivable
that Canberra can remain permanently the
capital. For the satisfaction of certain parish
persons, and some Sydney boodlers,
who threatened to destroy a nation if
their petty interests were not sufficiently
regarded, the choice of a site was ridiculously
limited by the Federal Constitution; and for
the further satisfaction of the same people,
whose views in the meantime had grown
smaller and narrower, every effort was
made to secure a capital which should be
no capital, but merely a suburb of con-
gested Sydney. No one looking at a map
of Australia can be persuaded that the great
city of the future will rise at Canberra.
In point of situation the far and lonely ham-
let of Alice Springs has a much worthier
claim; in point of the natural advantages
which may enable a city to grow into a vast
hive of splendid industry, where white men
live under the best conditions, there are a
thousand places in the continent in com-
parison with which Canberra is an absurdity
and a jest. The choice made, if not the
worst possible, runs the worst possible very
close; and it is practically certain that
within the next 20 years one of the urgent
political cries to which the statesmen ol the
time will be compelled to give heed will be
for the shifting of the entire outfit to a place
worthy to be the heart and centre of a live
and earnest federation. Then a time will
come when Canberra will stand forlorn as
the. ruins of Palmyra, a monument of our
political folly and worse, and wandering
tourists will look upon its 27 feet of com-
mencement column on Kurrajong Hill, and
pelt verbal offal at the memorial which tells
of the cowardice of early politicians who,
elected on a Labor vote, were afraid to
trust the people with the choice of a site for
their country’s capital. And when Canberra
ceases to be the capital, the cash spent upon
it will be a more serious waste than even the
interest on Cohen’s loans, for the whole col-
lection of bricks, gardens and imported lakes
will be useless as the Pyramids, and hopeless
as a grave at the South Pole.
As marking a passing stage in Australia’s
national growth, Canberra may, neverthe-
less, answer its purpose. Reviewing the
work of the recent years, it seems too much to
expect that our present alleged statesmen
could grasD the possibilities of a great national
city. Nations do sometimes learn something
from the follies of their past when their evil
effects have been pressed bitterly home upon
them. The making of a city is a great
matter, and the O’Malleys and Fishers
can hardly be expected to rise to the height
of grasping their splendid opportunities. The
city of Canberra —an official village depend-
ing upon and in turn helping to feed the city
of Sydney—is perhaps as big a thing as
those now in office are capable of creating
with any chance of success. Larger states-
men must face the larger problem of the
future, and keener sight and deeper vision
go to the making of the white man’s capital
of the South. Canberra may then be some
sort of guide to the larger work, its failures
may lead to the larger successes, and a city,
clean, vigorous, sweet and wholesome rise
on the ruins of the former mistake. Nor
shall we be the first to up-camp and move on
to better things. The map of the Old World
is sprinkled thickly with the remains
of cities which failed because of their situa-
tions. Kings and emperors planted them
with blare of trumpets and solemn laying
of foundation stones to the strains of what
may have been the age’s equivalent for the
“Old Hundredth” ; but the land and the sea
and the rivers and the water supply and a
thousand other factors which go to the crea-
tion of a city spoke their word, and the places
were left a desolation. Canberra will be
made into some sort of a capital, and
the taste and wisdom of Barnum
O’Malley, the Minister whom even
the Tory press-barrackers for Can-
berra parade as a cheap joke, will
write itself into its shape and growth;
but Australia will march on to bigger
things, and the final choice of the
greater capital site is not yet. Meanwhile,
the guns and trumpets have ceased to sound,
the imports of cheap-labor goods continue
to . come over the low tariff wall, and the
voice of the unemployed will soon be louder
than the cheers that last week shook the
flags on Kurrajong Hill.
THE BLIND MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Against a wall near the Temple a blind man has
stood for 27 years listening to the sounds of Lon-
don : waiting for coppers.
With his back to the wall of Empire, his hat
in his palsied hands,
Passed by in the roar of traffic, the Blind
Man shivers and stands;
With a whine to the earth for coppers, and a
curse when a rival’s near.
He has begged for the Empire’s largesse full
many a vagabond year.
When his sons in the Hungry ’Forties arose
and departed hence,
Bull strode like a purse-proud beggar in his
new-found affluence;
He mocked at the Yank and the German: “I
have sons at work,” said he,
“And they raise tae the golden plunder in the
lands beyond the sea!”
“You are strong,” said the nations straightly
—“why loaf on your sons for bread,
Till your ancient strength has vanished, and
your sons wax wise, instead?
Why strut like a self-made cripple, a shade
on each forthright eye.
Till your sight in your dotage passes, and you
whine in a noisome sty?
“Why batten on distant children in the lands
far oversea,
When the world has need of an England in
a strong man’s panoply?
Why halt when the world goes onward?
Come! March with the nations all!” —•
“Be off!” said the Blind Man, sourly. “Let
me stand by the Empire’s wall!
“I am rich with my children’s shekels, torn
forth from the sundered earth;
With my sons for the Empire’s helots, let me
laugh in my vagrant mirth!
March on with your upstart nations, with
the pelfless rank-and-file?
Not me!” said the Blind Man, proudly.
“That’s scarcely the English style.
“I am tired of the marching onward, I am
rich with my sons’ red gold.
So why should I march with nations that are
not of my purse-proud fold?
I’ve bought me the pitch of a beggar, and
this is my English whim—
To beg whilst my children labor far out on
the Empire’s rim !”
“I guess,” at last said the Kanuck, “it’s time
that we took a pull—
I can raise me a brand-new nation with the
cash that I pay to Bull !”
“That’s so,” said the tall Australian; “I’m
full of the Old Man’s game;
Let him work for himself and prosper; mine,
too, is a nation’s aim.”
Then up spake the Afrikander —he was bat-
tered and lame and sore.
“You fellows were fooled by the Blind Man,”
he said, “when you spilt my gore.
You were fooled by the stout old beggar, who
stands by the distant Bank ;
So we scrapped, but I bear no malice”—and
his voice was clear and frank.
Then answered the Maorilander: “There’s
something we won’t deny—
We were all of us over-hasty when we black-
ened your nation’s eye.
We were fooled by the distant Blind Man,
when we rose to answer his call,
And I reckon we Maorilanders were the
greatest fools of all!
“So, seeing our jobs are waiting, and seeing
our parent’s hale,
I vote that we give him a trifle, paid down
on the cheerful nail !”
“Agreed,” said the lean Canadian. “I vote
that his goods come in
On a cheaper scale than the German’s and
the Dago’s kith and kin!”
“That’s right,” said the tall Australian. “Till
his Bank-side pitch he leaves,
Instead of our total harvest we’ll chuck
him our choicest sheaves !
For the mines of the Roaring ’Fifties sing
small in Australia now,
And I work at the earnest anvil, and I follow
the patient plough !”
“That’s me!” said the Afrikander, “for the
Jo’burg boom is o’er;
But I’ll join with the rest as partners, till
the Old Man toils once more !”
So the voice of the Four Young Nations rang
out with a strong refrain—
“ Get away from those needless crutches- —
get back to your job again !”
And the Blind Man wakened slowly, for his
head was large and sore ;

He stood by the Bank bare-headed, and he

Then the voice, of the children answered, and

“We are mates, and have yarned together out

offer you ten per cent.

the Blind Man waved his crutch

haven’t I raised you all;

Then the Four Young Nations answered—
and their tone was strangely new—
“ You collared our plunder gladly, and you
painted the Empire blue !
You have wasted the substance gaily that

You have revelled and ouaffed and roystered

The Beautiful Doctrine of Non-
Resistance.
An English Quaker gentleman is in Aus-
tralia, observing at first hand the working
of the Universal Training System, to which
his sect is opposed, "for conscientious rea-
sons.” The Quaker folk object to the use
of force in either private or national differ-
ences, believing that everything could be
made nice and harmonious by a policy of
love and brotherliness and non-resistance
generally.. Since a student should scruti-
nise all sides of his subject, The Bulletin
commends this plain, unvarnished tale to
the Quaker student’s notice. At Seoul
(Korea) there recently opened a new trial
of certain Christians, previously convicted
(on their own confessions) of conspiring
to murder Japanese Governor-General
Terauchi. .Baron Yun Chi Ho (a former
Korean Cabinet Minister) had been treated
as head of . the conspiracy, and sentenced to
10. years’ imprisonment, and several other
prisoners had been gaoled for longer or
shorter terms. Some of the evidence at the
new trial (reported in the Japan Adver-
tiser, Tokio) was enlightening—it may
even enlighten a Quaker observer as to the
whyness of the Australian Universal Train-
ing business:—
Prisoner Kim Epng Pong, sentenced to five vears,
was examined.
1 he Court: At the police headquarters you con-
fessed that you organised your sympathisers into a
Semen Doshikwai (Young Men’s Association) for the
purpose of helping to establish a military school at
West Chientao, and assassinating prominent officials.
Prisoner: Yes, but this was all because I was
forced to say so under inexpressible torture. I was
under examination with torture for 15 days. I was
strung up, suspended in mid-air, flogged, with my
lower garments removed. At one time they said they
would flog me to death. I several times lost con-
sciousness, and was restored by having cold water
dashed over me. I was forced to crouch under a
shelf not higher than my breast, in such a position
that I could neither sit down nor stand up, and
beaten with the stove poker, until I thought I was as
good as dead. Finally, I said “ves, yes,” to every-
thing they said. If I had been asked under these
circumstances whether I had murdered my father I
should have said “yes” to that, too.
Another appellant, Kn, Cheng Hyen, also ex-
plained things: “I confessed, because like the others,
I suffered unspeakable tortures. I was 70 days at
the police headquarters. At one time I was hung
up bv the hands from 2 a.m. to 10 o’clock in the
evening. The examiner said: ‘lf you don’t confess,
we shall torture you to death. We don’t care if
we . do kill you.’ After that, they tortured me
again. At one time, on a very cold winter day, they
stripped me naked, and poured ice-water over me
from head to foot for three hours. They kept tell-
ing me to confess, saying: ‘Seventy or 80 men have
already confessed. You are the only one that holds
out.’ So at last I yielded.”
Cha Kyun Syel also had some experiences: “It
was very cold. They accused me of those crimes,
and I denied it. At one time very cold water was
poured over my head. I was beaten with a stove
poker and other instruments.... I was under exam-
ination in this way for 26 days. In the meantime,
they starved me. The examiner said: ‘lf you confess
we will feed you and stop this torture.’ I have the
scars on me now. They pricked my head and shoul-
ders with knives; they scon died me with fire. I
remember everything pretty clearly up to the 14th
or 15th day. After that, things are confused. After
they ceased torturing me, I could hear the agonising
cries of the others who were suffering.”
The gentleman of peace from England will
notice that the unhappy Christian Korean
prisoners carried out to the uttermost the
Quaker doctrine of non-resistance. They
might have resisted once ; but the time for
that passed when Japan challenged Korea
to produce its gun, and Korea hadn’t any
gun to produce. And because Australia
doesn’t want to be in the same shameful
position it is busy getting a gun now, and
learning how to use it.
♦
The House Unbeautiful.
Randolph Bedford’s curse and cry:—
The ugly, inconvenient, uncomfortable dwelling
houses of the people may not be ignored, because
in them people spend most of their lives, and their
lives are made by their surroundings to a greater
extent _ than at first sight appears. The hideous
galvanised-iron “terraces” of Richmond and Colling-
wood and Waterloo and Newtown produce, many in-
stances of the class of people the thinker might expect
from a judgment of their dwellings. The working-
class wife who suddenly kills herself and children,
and the suburban man who commits deeds of violence
which are debited to his indulgence in one shandy-
gaff immediately preceding the outrage, are tio oc
less blamed than pitied when one sees the hovel-
in which a rentlord grinds them for dividends.
But Australia suffers in its buildings not so muc
from a desire to save money as from mere want o
taste, equally of the architects who plan the dwei •
ing and the ignorant person who pays for it. when
a savage begins building, his first instinct is w
build to his climate, his second to build it 81


materials as natural to his climate as can be. The
Eskimo builds his hut of snow, not only because it
is very much the easiest thing to his hand, but be-
cause of it he can build the warmest and most
draught-proof house. The Papuan builds his house
on stilts, and leaves it perforated like a meat-safe
to admit every breeze that moves. The Australian
aboriginal rarely built a house at all, and so was
condemned by the Australian pioneer for recognising
the Australian climate, which doesn't call for shelter
except during a very few months of the year. The Greek
builded to suit his climate just as the Indian
architect loved the domes Australia hasn’t got ; and
the Persian builded minarets and cupolas and flat-
roofed shady houses, surrounding cool quadrangles,
and the Italian copied the flat roofs and central
courts, and bettered it all by having the square of
the house only a room deep, so that the outer win-
dow permitted air to the quadrangle window and
across the inner court to the rooms on the other
side of the house. All these things one would think
the Australian architect would copy as soon as he
found a client with the money; one would expect,
after noting the Australian climate and the banking
returns and other evidences of Australia’s prosperity,
to see Sydney’s residential bays the dreams of
beauty they are not—to suddenly come upon a little
Palace of the Strozzi, to see a water-frontage house
imitating the Casa D’Oro of Venice ; a stone cupola,
or among trees a minaret green with the oxidation of
its copper. Instead, what does one see?
I live in a house perched on a yellow-brown sand-
stone rock, with a streak of red in it to mark the
stronger iron. The rock, a fig-tree and the morning-
glory that covers part of the cliff and has climbed
over the house, are the only beautiful things about
that dwelling excepting the bay, which does not belong
to it The house is all right on its ground floor,
though it has been built to hold the sweat and heat
of the climate, and not to part with it in a hurry ;
but the bedrooms —the important chambers for an
Australian house —have been sacrificed to the roof.
This is of the steen-hipned kind, much in demand
in a mad Countrv like Switzerland, where it is ad-
visable to have a roof like a church spire, so that
the snow will fall off and save the wages of the
Snow Shovellers’ Union. There is no snow in Aus-
tralia save in the Kosciusko country, yet all these
slavish copyists, the architects of Sydney who do
these things, rob the houses of snace and breathing
surface by making roofs for vodellers and for snow
to commit felo de se. As a result, this alleged bed-
room of mine has a door under the peak of the roof
where the bed may not stand. The bed is placed
under the lowest portion of the snow-shed, so that
the roof is within 2ft. of the bed head. The low
roof makes a mosquito harbor, but the ingenious
house-furnisher gives you a mosquito net to puzzle
him with. That mosquito net gives another roof
2ft below the snow-shed and 4ft. above the sleeper s
face and of hot nights the mosquito sings blood-
thirsty threats at the man inside the palatial
vacuum, and the man sleeps by jerks and wonders
whv he is so tired of mornings.
All around me are Queen Mart Antte houses, with
the precipitous roof of Switzerland, where the flat roof
should be holding thousands of diners looking out
over the wondrous panorama of Svdnev s night,,
white gables, shingle roofs, breathless places full of
angles for the love of angles mimicries of
old English farm-houses, where the death-rate was
five times as much as Australian conditions should
provide: dinky little windows that admit the winds
of Heaven at only one angle; small, iron-studded
doorsTn imitation of the vestrv entrance of some
little English church full of catarrh and other in
teresting diseases; glaring white small-entranced
houses like nothing so much as Noah s arks, so
that you could expect to see wooden animals come
out by two and a slate-colored Noah striking

Ward, Cohen an Idea.
IotJSEPH Warp eonjin Dukedom'oriwarna,
deavors to capture the L . , p eerage he
&S=p h e.king loan-
tries, induced to that course by the example
of Australia, are just on the eve of gripping
the idea of local fleets for the joint defence
of the Pacific, when the great champion of
the pledge and the pawn-ticket again dashes
into the fray, and re-introduces his dis-
carded notion of a united plunge into the
cash-vats of Israel, in order to provide
Britain with some ironmongery to protect
her interests at our end of the world. At a
cost of 10s. per head per annum for each
white person in the countries which became
parties to the arrangement, 25 Dread-
noughts or thereabout could be sent cruis-
ing around all the waters of the world,
ready to let fly at anything that looked like
insulting the might and majesty of empire.
It is a showy sort of scheme to present at
the shirt-front of J. Bull ; and although
it has no chance of coming off, Bull is
expected to look pleased about it and do some-
thing for the patriotic gentleman who makes
the suggestion. Australia has already set its
course, and intends to have a fleet of its
own, under its own control, and mostly of
its otvn building, and manned by its own
sailors, and can therefore be counted out of
any such arrangement which may be made.
Canada is halting between two opinions,
but the Liberal crowd —and Liberalism will
have another innings there in due course —
is strongly in favor of following the Aus-
tralian plan, and undertaking the defence of
the North Pacific with a local fleet. Maoriland
is in doubt; but Ward is such an extinct
volcano in his own land that the mere fact
of his advocating a scheme ought to pretty
well ensure its rejection. The proposal is
full of bad spots, anyway. The borrowed
cash, with its 3 per cent, sinking fund,
would still be unpaid when the Dreadnoughts
w r hich it purchased were on the scrap-heap ;
and the scheme involves enormous and con-
tinued borrowing, which in the nature of
things could bring permanent joy to no one
but Cohen. The basic idea of the great
imperial splash is that Britain can manage
things ever so much better than anybody
else, and that the growing spirit of national-
ism in Canada, Australia and Maoriland can
count for nothing in the efficiency and
capability of their sea defenders. All this, is
tremendously open to question. Everything
seems to indicate that an Australian fleet
can do better for the defence of Australia’s
shores than a section of a British fleet in
Australian waters. True, Australians have
never been tested at the game, but. then the
same thing applies to the British, who
haven’t been seriously tried at sea since
Trafalgar, except in the American war of
1812, when they didn’t shine to any extent.
First and last, England has been tolerably
blind in all its dealings with over-seas mat-
ters, and trust in a fleet guided and directed
from London might be a very blind business
indeed. If our own statesmen mismanage
things they are at least near enough to be
goaded into right ways by the pieces of
jagged rock we throw at them; but .if
Downing-street erred to the extent of leaving
us altogether in the lurch, there would be
nothing left to us except to sit down and
let the raging foeman walk on us. From
no conceivable standpoint, except that of
Cohen, does Touseph Ward’s proposal.look
anything better than his late Maoriland
financing, and saying that we reach about
the limit.

rescue. But the Turk contrived somehow
to bluff Europe and maintain his iniquity in
most of his possessions until the final and
unexpected destruction leaped at, him from
Sophia, Belgrade and Athens. That he is
now completely knocked out seetns beyond
all reasonable question. Even the impreg-
nable fortress of Janina is down, and
Adrianople appears doomed. The Syrian,
therefore, judges that the time is ripe, and
is presenting his demand for autonomy. All
things considered, it is a very moderate de-
mand, for the Turk has misgoverned Syria
in a fashion that might well justify the
population of the ancient country which
Beniiadad ruled in taking the Ottoman
person by the beard, and sticking the tem-
pered blade of Damascus into him at many
points. Outlying villages beyond the direct
trading routes were for years systematically
robbed by the Bedouin of the desert; and the
Turkish Pasha at Damascus, far from pro-
tecting the peaceful citizens who paid their
taxes, took a toll of all plunder. Even on
the main commercial highways caravans
were constantly attacked. But no Turkish
soldiery were ever sent to shoot the offend-
ers ; indeed, the troops themselves when on
the march were not above taking anything
that Allah threw in their way. What the
outcome of the new movement may be it
would be hard to predict, Syria was in the
dim past a strong and. Compact little
kingdom under its own native kings. Later,
on the bursting-up of Alexander’s empire,
it became itself an empire, stretching at its
utmost limit to the borders of India, and
having a magnificent Greek-built canital at
Antioch, on the Orontes. Modern Syria is
not the sort of place to lean to any particu-
lar greatness on the map. of the world, but it
has reasonable possibilities as a State if it
can get loose from the strangle-hold of the
Ottoman. All evidences seem to point to the
fact that very soon the Grand Turk will be
only a name and a red fez and a green flag
and the memory of a large, unwholesome
curse.
The Case for the Blind.
From one of the delegates:—
An inter-State conference of the blind was re-
cently held in Melbourne, and was attended by repre-
sentatives from South Auß., Vie., N. S. Wales and
Queensland. Many things were discussed and many
conclusions arrived at. Among the most important
of the latter were these; —
fl) That the national invalidity pension should
be paid as a right to all blind people over the age
of 16, regardless of their income.
(2) That all institutions for the education of
blind children should he nationalised, and placed
under the control of the Minister for Education in
the same way as ordinary State schools, and that the
education of blind children should be compulsory.
(3) That, in view Of the high cost of living, the
wages paid to blind Workers in the various indus-
trial blind institutions is not sufficient to ensure
the ordinary comforts of life.
(4) That more harmonious relations would exist
between the workers in the various institutions and
their respective Hoards of management if the workers
were allowed representation thereon.
The idea of the pension being paid as a right was
opposed bv several of the delegates on the ground
that too much Was beine asked of a Government
that was already doing a very generous thing in
paving a pensioh to the blind, subject to the pro-
visions of the Invalid and Old Age Pensions Act;
on the other hand, there are many who are not will-
ing to come forward and declare themselves paupers.
And there are many others who are not entitled
because they are receiving £1 a week, or a little
more, but are nevertheless not receiving enough to
buv ordinary comforts, and can never hope to earn
enough to do it. And it is really an unfair propo-
sition to tttpect men who had been used to th £ ,r
£3 a week, or more, when sighted, to live on
a week, or very little more, after losing their sight
through no fault of their own. Such men do not re-
ceive more than £1 a week when they « CJ “
the institutions, and in most cases they get less than
£1 • and they are exceptions who can average
30S a week even after spending three years
or more learning a trade. Cases are some-
times cited of blind men earning 30s. and
35s a week in institutions; but it would be
safe to say that the average for men alone is not a
cent more than 255., and if the women are included
it is much lower. So, even with the pension the
blind community would not have much chance for
luxuries For these reasons, and others, the con-
ference 'at last adopted the first resolution quoted

Thebe is somewhere or other a saying to
the effect that in leaving a city one looks
only at the steeples. Perhaps the departing
Chelmsford, of N.S.W., saw only the
funnels of Johnson’s locomotives when he
sent the Chief Commissioner a gushiDg
letter of thanks for the kindness and atten-
tion he had received while trundling round.
Such compliments are, no doubt, very plea-
sant; but the test of a good railway service
is not the extra attention it gives to wan-
dering personages. The more-nearly ideal
service would be the one that shocked and
astounded the roving cocked-hat by treating
him just as it treated ordinary paying pas-
sengers. If he objected or looked dazed, the
manager might courteously explain that they
were kept so busy attending thoroughly to
all branches of their business that they
really could not afford the time to fuss un-
necessarily over any one traveller, however
illustrious he might be. On the same day
that Chelmsford’s complimentary remarks
were printed, a cattle-owner told how his
unfortunate beasts were kept jammed in
their trucks without a drink from 3 p.m. on
Tuesday till 10 a.m. on Thursday—43 long
clanking hours, with intervals of clumsy,
knock-down shunting. The wafting of Gov-
ernors hither and thither is, of course, quite
a different thing from cattle shifting; but a
well-run railway service would earn praise
for both jobs, instead of bouquets for one
and bricks for the other.
♦
From T. L. Mills (president of the Aus-
tralasian Country Press Association), who
recently depreciated the Australian: —
“Maorilander” in a recent Bulletin accurately
condensed the pith and point of the article I con-
tributed to the daily papers of M.L. regarding my
impressions of Australia. Does it really matter
whether I come from Mangaweka or Invercargill.
And is it fair to condemn a 20 minutes’ stay m
Australia when behind that 20 minutes there has
been a period of at least 20 years’ study of Aus-
tralian men and affairs through a professional
reading of Sydney and Melbourne newspapers and
by coming in contact, as a journalist, with repre-
sentative Australians during their visits to M.L..
As a matter of fact, I was in Sydney three weeks
and Melbourne a week, and what 1 published were
my own impressions, over my own name. After all,
it is my signed and sealed opinion, not hastily written,
against “Maorilartder’s” anonymous contradiction.
It would be a queer world if we had all to take
our politics from the other fellow, and either see
eye to eye with him or get it on the point from
“Maorilandpr’s” punch.
To which “Maorilander,” on the case being
put to him, replied he was glad T. L.
Mills admitted that he (“Maorilander )
had accurately condensed Mills’s article.
That condensation might be repeated thus:
(1) The Australian is a loafer.
(2) The Australian is a selfish hog.
(3) Thank God the Maorilander is not as the
Australian.
If after “20 years’ study of the Australian
and his affairs through professional reading
of the Commonwealth’s press” (to Say no-
thing of three weeks and a week
in Melbourne). Mills arrives at those signed
and sealed opinions, not hastily written,
the only question that arises is as to what
sort of implement Mills uses for investi-
gating purposes. A dose of Knibbs s Year
Book wouldn’t do it much harm, anyhow.
“Don Q.”: The immigrant had just got
outside an Australian square feed and
lighted his pipe. He had come out as a
“farm laborer,” and he explained where he
obtained his experience, and, incidentally,
something about the roast beef and the ale
that made old England’s name:
I was a shop assistant, living-in in one of the
big drapery stores in London. I had eight years of
it, and if I’d had any more I think I would have
died. The food was of the poorest and shoddiest
description, the staple being bread and margarine
and weak tea. Once a day we had a cut of meat ot
the commonest and cheapest variety, usually as tough
as indiarubber. Expenses were kept down to the very
lowest mark, and in my last store I don t think 1
ever rose from the table with a satisfied feeling.
There was alwavs a void somewhere, and I could never
understand how the margarine (on Sundays we had
butter) was laid on so evenly and thinly to the great
slabs of stale bread until one Sunday I got a chance
to visit the kitchen. A large, flat board, studded
with tacks, was laid on the table. Slices of bread
covered this board, the tacks keeping them from
slipping. The butter was melted in a pot and the
cook, with a large, soft brush, like a whitewash
brush, skimmed each slice of bread with the deft
hand of a master painter. Sunday mornings we
regularlv had ham and eggs (stale eggs and faulty,
damaged bacon cuts). Our working hours were
8 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. on five days; on Saturdays till
11.30 p.m. or midnight. Twenty minutes were
allowed for dinner, and 20 for tea. Pay for a
hours working week was, for men, £3O a year, phts
the board and lodging, and for the girls, £l5.
Buyers and beads of departments were allowed to
marrv and live outside the working premises, but
marriage on the part of a member of the rank and
file meant discharge. Too many of the girls made
extra money in the usual way, the barrack system
being a breeder of prostitution.
I said to this man, “I thought everybody
lived on lashings of good roast beef and

A significant pointer to the British Gov-
ernment’s view of naval defence, so far as
the outlying Dominions of the Empire are
concerned, was given in London iast week,
during a banquet at which Maonland s Min
ister of Defence, James Allen, was the
principal guest Allen’s view <>hich un-
doubtedly is also the view of the Massey
Government) is turned away from the
scheme of subsidising the Fleet that is
bottled up in the North Sea, and towards
separate local units —the policy, in shoit,
adopted by Australia. Allen has made this
clear on several occasions since lie arrived
in England not long ago. Simultaneously
with Allen’s expressions in this regard, ex-
Tremier Joseph Ward, who is also in Lon-
don, has been flogging the local-unit sc beme
as if it were a proposition of Beelzebub.
The argument between the two politicians
has been loud and continuous, and has now
clearly ended in favor of Allen. At the
banquet referred to, Harcourt, Secretary of
State for the Colonies, went out of his way
to publiclv thank him for his advice in
matters of defence.” Ward was not men-
tioned Of course, the opinion of the British
Government has long been known ; neverthe-
less the pat on the back awarded to the
official Maorilander for ranging himself with
the Australian policy was welcome—and all
the more welcome because it could not have
been much more definite in the very unusual
circumstances.
Our Colonial Capital: The Paean of the
Little Australians.
Scores of horsemen gave a true colonial flavor to
the scene. —S. M. Herald.
The true colonial flavor of the scene
Makes us rejoice, and lifts our hearts with
Remembering all the things that mivht have
Australia -our demands denied.
A colony we are, and shall remain,
The hanger-on of something far away; _
Our nationhood is but a dream, and vam,
To stir one dust-cloud on the landscape grey.
We made a Commonwealth, we chose a flag,
We spoke in large, loud tones of destiny;
But that was only politicians brag,
And went for what it was with you and mA
We cannot grow beyond the thing we were.
Our infant swaddling bands are round us
Behohl, U the flag of Empire takes the aif
Where our colonial horsemen front the mil.
The place and scene are suited to our views.
A shabby village full of dust and heat
Is what! by mutual consent, we choose
To wear the title of our I ederal seat.
This fits exactly our colonial taste -
To have the Commonwealth’s selected crown
An offshoot of congested Sydney, h lac f e(^
A half-day’s journey from the bricks of town.
A nation might have had a larger dream,
\nd built a city vast and clean and fair,
It might have taken measures so extreme
That no importer in the spoils could sliar ,
But we colonials understand these things,
And we have pulled the wires with some
Hear far-shrilling trumpet how it sings!
The game goes better than we dared expect:
Hail to Canberra!' King O’Malley, hail!
O Brother this is, well and wisely done.
Merchant"to merchant shall repeat the tale
Of how the fateful village was begun.
If some new capital we needs „
This is the sort on which broad Fat may
TfiusTre’the Constitution’s words fulfilled,
And all things done in true colonial style.

The Empire Trade Commission, sitting at
Dunedin (M.L.), has been hearing some
news about preferential trade. According to
evidence tendered by J. W. Henton, of the
Chamber _ot Commerce, it appears that
vvith the connivance of British shipowners,
,^ r “ an , manufacturers are able to defeat
tle trade preference of 10 per cent, given
by Maonknd to British goods. tllnton

T.A.”: The coming elections for the
Sydney Lmversity Senate, under the new
Act, threaten to be strenuous. There are
l seats to be filled, and the retiring sena-
tors number about 15. Of these, High
Coiwt Justices Griffith and Barton and four
otheis are not candidates. The remaining
nine have been nominated as “the old
brigade ticket, and are being run bv the
conservative crowd, backed up by the don
element. Another lot who don’t want to be
frozen out by a block vote of the right-
thinking element have formed themselves
into ‘the progressive party,” and will run a
ticket on their lonely. If the warring facul-
ties or Law, Medicine, Arts and Science
can coalesce and nominate a real progres-
sive bunch, they will have a chance to
create a live Senate and galvanise the
\ arsity. About 100 nominees are clamor-
tor selection on the progressive ticket
and the city is at present full of wild-eyed
persons engaged in tracking down every
person who has graduated at the ’Varsity
since it started. If The Bulletin knows of
any hiding places of forgotten graduates,

gladness scarcely seems to justify the ex-
pense. In addition to the actual cost of
his court, the State Governor is apt to cause
serious loss of time to busy State officials
who, on his account, neglect the job they are
paid to do. For instance, the time McGowen

after the fatigue of hearing that the heresy
hunt was off.
Orient, ’ of some people concerned in the
Ghia case in Melbourne:—
The first Chinese Consul-General for Australia
who arrived only three or four years ago, was a dis-
tinguished elderly Chinaman ; but he was so deficient
in the English language and in his knowledge of
Australian ways, that he very quickly subsided and
ong 1 became locum-tenens. Then the permanent
man, Hwang, came along; and he was soon found
to be all there. Educated in America, he might
pass for a man of Florida or New Orleans, with
rather a strong American accent. Fond of public
speaking, Hwang has a singularly impulsive oratory
which 1 never remarked in another Oriental. Chia
his former secretary, is quite dissimilar. Hwang
has the American stamp; Chia has that of France
Xou might take him for a fiery little Spaniard or
Italian. Hwang soon found a defect in him; he was
deficient in knowledge of the Chinese language!
Ihis is a frequent complaint in Hong 1 Kong against
young Celestials who return from abroad. There-
fore, the Hong Kong University is established Its
language will be mainlv English, but Chinese is to
be kept up. On the other hand, the Hankow Univer-
sity will adopt Chinese as the language, while keep-
ing abreast of Hong Kong in every point of Western
culture. There are two important languages in
China, and so important that the Bible has to be
translated into each. These are the Wenli for the
intellectual toffs, and the Mandarin for the commoner
people who read. The Bible, more or less, is also
m 15 other dialects, each spoken by millions. Chia
also made a bungle by hoisting the Dragon flag at
the Melbourne Embassy for a victory by the Im-
perial Army over the Republicans. Hwang was away
at. the time, and it caused him much annoyance,
bringing down upon him the execration of almost
the whole Chinese community, crystallised in a fierce
letter from the Melbourne National League. How-
ever, this is not likely to have had anything to do
with Chia s dismissal, an order for which dulv came
from Pekin. After his marriage with Unie Russell
they.lived at the Sandringham Hotel, but she has
w returned to her father and mother at Brighton.

The Australasian tour of the recently-con-
stituted Hamilton-Plimmer comedy co. was
commenced at the Palace (Sydney) on Sat-
urday night with “Dr. Wake’s Patient,”
played last in the city by Herbert Flem-
ming’s co. some few years ago. The theatre
was packed, as was to be expected with
such names illuminating the cast as Airs.
Brough, Beatrice Day, Geo. S. Titheradge,
Arthur Styan and H. R. Roberts, to say
nothing of half a dozen other popular stag-
ers. Indeed, since the days when Brough
and Boucicault offered the public the rare
talent of their people, no more attractive
comedy combination has gathered under the
same play-house roof in Australia. And in
these days of eternal musical comedy piffle,
unmellowdrama and other side-shows, a re-
vival of the Brough and Boucicault tradi-
tions is commendable, and (or should be) a
payable undertaking. On the opening night
the co., or some of it, was playing at too high
a nerve tension, and occasionally brimmed
over into the shallows of artificiality; but
this defect was merely the defect of new
machinery running above normal, and will
disappear rapidly.
‘Dr. Wake’s Patient” is a bright, whole-
some comedy, well-put together, excepting
that Scene 1 of Act 2 (a waiting room for
patients at the doctor’s residence) is dragged
out too far. Still, much fine work was done
in the scene. Mrs. Brough, the superior
Countess, flabbergasted before the cold, sus-
picions of the Lord Bishop, who, return-
ing from the. consulting room to the waiting
room, finds his hat hung upon a nude Venus
was at her best. Harry Plimmer was the

Bishop, and he was a credit to the see.
Beatrice Day shone also in the scene; but
Bizette Parkes had bad luck. With two
such players as Mrs. Brough and Beatrice
Day to keep up with, she had the stage for
some time. Titheradge made an excellent
character out of the mutton-brained Earl
ot St. Olbyn ; so did Arthur Stvan, as the
ponderous, self-satisfied English county
cocky, likewise, Kate Towers, as his homely
mother-wife; similarly, Sydney Stirling, as
the likeable Willie-boy (“absolutely”) ; also,
H. R. Roberts, as the fashionable doctor,
though an occasional touch of nervousness
tricked him into a trifle of over-acting. There
is no need to go right through a cast which
was so generally useful to a successful re-
vival. The audience was well pleased, and
its appreciation was distributed with even
hand and hoof. As for floral tributes, they
were served out by the barrow-load.
“Cuss in Boots,” the J. C. Williamson
panto which arrived at Her Majesty’s,
•Sydney, in time for the Easter cow’s At
Home, has had the benefit of several weeks’
training in Melbourne, and may, therefore,
be regarded as a finished product. As usual,
the simple old nursery story is only allowed
to emerge occasionally from a welter of
turns, some of them good. Its only uses, in
fact, are that it gives a homely label'to a long
evening’s variety entertainment, and affords
one man a chance of cleverly imitating a
cat. Violet Loraine, the tall principal
girl-boy, has the right figure, a robust sing-
ing voice, and so much youthful vim that
she consistently overacts. However, modern
pantomime being a thoroughly unnatural
sort of excrescence, overacting may be con-
sidered necessary. George Miller, the
Dame of the show, is less noticeable than
some others Australia has known. Among
his virtues, he is -not impossibly agile, and
he rarely assault the other panto people
with his umbrella; in the manner of the
Stone Age squaw. Byplay, seems to be this
earnest performer’s strong shit, and he is
often quaintly absurd without ever being
uproarious. O. E. Lennon, the Cat, puts
in a hot and strenuous evening, and holds
up the story when the rest of the vast com-
pany have forgotten it. Stewart Garner,
the Ogre, suggests Kink O’Malley dipped

in wine. Alice Russon (the Lost Prin-
cess) and Dorothy Firmin (the Fairy
Queen) are both gracefully colorless. “Pip”
Powell, who is King GrqhbUs, works very
hard for his laughs, and occasionally gets
them. The Fred Leslie-Ivy Schilling dances
■ are smart interludes, but, considered as
star items, they don’t call for superlatives.
Leslie too often starts out with the intention
of composing a dance, and ends up by com-
piling a physical culture demonstration.
Queen Felina’s fairies once get fairly jigging
together, and convert the stage into a grove
of waving limbs and draperies; but the
dancing otherwise is neither very frequent
nor very noticeable. The last scene of Act
I. is a golden testimonial to the art of
W. R. Coleman and the lighting expert.
“At the Ogre’s Gates,” a Coleman back-
cloth representing walls and towers amidst
mountains, is another fine bit of painting.
The most joyous turn of the evening is the
burlesque acrobatic act of Collins and
Hart. The Dame, Leslie and Powell also
com hi "e in a knock-abqut railway-station
turn that is very ’ funny in spasms. Many
of the gags that were moderately fresh when
the show started are now stricken with age.
Others that are confidently wheeled out have
been in bath chairs for years. Taken alto-
gether, the costuming is not as fine as in
some past pantos, notably Nellie Stewart’s
glittering production of “Cinderella,” an
event of years ago; the same remark ap-
plies more or less to the marching and
music; and there is a smaller allowance
than usual of the jokes and jingles that
carry beyond the theatre doors.

The change of residence from Her

all.

After all the hurry and excitement of

not until late in the week that the proud

was able to conduct his intelligent swine
on to the stage and demonstrate what cul-
ture will do for hogs. The great advantage
of tutoring bacon in the raw is that, when
it has acquired a full know-ledge of the ad-
vantages of constitutional government and
modern explosives, it does not start to throw
the latter at you in order to gain the former.
The Clardy boys, the Lessos, Nellie Maher,
Seven Heraldos, Carlton Cooper and Eva
Mudge help to make the bill attractive.
“Oil and Water,” a dance-drama, has been
causing the Crystal Palace to do some extra
advertising this week. The “water” of the
yarn is a young man who habitually takes a
front stall, and the “oil” is a “classic” dancer
on whom the young man has his eye—and
there is a lot for the eye to be on, the lady,
as remarked before, being of the “classic”
species. Eventually he marries her; but
after a while she finds washing-up slow-,
escapes by the side door and gets back to the
stage. The film introduces various freak
dances as well as the classic ones. “The
Secret of the Mine.” an underground drama,
bulging with fires, floods and the usual mov-
ing picture brand of sensational escapes, was
the best of the other programmes. This was
at the Colonial.

the assistance of an advt. from Brother
Snowball. Miss Elwyn Harvey is now the
lady who lodges in the monkery, and makes
goo-goo eyes at Brother Paul, the previous
vision having gone to Sydney to participate
in the joys and sorrows of “From Convent

The Yankee musical scream that started
at Melbourne Bijou last Saturday is neither
as piercing as a gimlet nor as infectiously
hilarious as Joe Cook standing on his dig-
nity ; but, like the sword-thrust that hap-
pened to Mercutio, it will suffice. The
prices are popular and the entertainment
worth the money. The stout comedian gets
laughs by being kicked on his inflated
stomach, " and that jest grows monotonous
after a while. Still, the kicker, one Bert
Le Blanc, is otherwise a legitimate source
of merriment, and he shares the principal
honors of the uproar with Miss Eugenie Le
Blanc, an eccentric little performer who re-
veals pale blue bloomers when she lifts her
skirts. Some of the characterisations in
“The Grafters” suggest _ Mrs. Wiggs;
some of the music is melodious in its rag-
time swing; and some of the fooling has
an air of novelty. Moreover, the work of
the supernumerary golfers and others who
supply the chorus, ranging from smart to
so-so, seems likely to improve as the : season
advances. With commendable disregard
for conventionality. “The Grafters” announce
two performances on Good Friday.

“The Mad Reporter”: A meeting of the Prima
Donnas’ Husbands’ Union was held at the Trades
Hall last night. Prince Adagio, who presided, said
the union had come to the parting of the ways.
(“Bravo!” and “Hear, hear!”) The managers must
be told that, nolens volens, they must agree with
the views expressed by the recent deputation of hus-
bands of prima donnas. The? demanded only their
rights. (“Hear, hear!” “BraVissimo!”) They were
necessary to the success of the opera-stage and the
concert-platform, because they were indispensable to
the happiness of the ladies on whom opera-stage and
concert-platform depended. (Great enthusiasm.)
These managers —(cries of “Ah, Briganti! “lief . )
—now demanded that the husband of a prima
donna should pay for his own travelling. (“Shame! )
Yet they knew that if husbands were left behind,
many a top note would suffer. He might allude to
the sufferings of Baron Havana de Muria, who,
despite his tears (sensation) —yes, tears I—was
forced to agree to his wife receiving her own salary,
when, indeed, he had been his wife s treasurer tor
many years, in happier climes —alas-—than these.
(Cheers.) Baron Havana de Muria in a pathetic
speech moved the following resolution: That unless
the managers of concerts and operas m Australia
agree to pay to the husband of a prima donna an
amount equal and in addition to the full salary of
such prima donna, together with transport charges,
we, the executive of the Prima Donnas Husbands
Union, give notice that we declare strike of all
leading ladies, and order it to be maintained until
the dispute has been settled in full. The motion
was seconded by Count Con Passion?, and carried
amidst enthusiasm. The strike begins as from to;
dav, and it is anticipated that the Chorus Singers
Union will join immediately. The executive of t
Incapable Bassoon Players’ Union has declared in
sympathy with the strike, and there is . dtle doubt
that all the affiliated noise merchants will refuse to
blow after this week unless the demand is granted.
“C Ockney”: The picture-postcard celebrity,
Phvllis Dare, is establishing a record for a London
Gaiety actress. She is reported to be engaged to be
married? and not to a member of the peerage! The

“O’Blin”: Last year I blessed the Melbourne
Repertory Club with a hard-earned guinea, and now
I am questioning the wisdom of the investment. I
have a grievance against the club on account of its
furtive cultivation of intellectual swank. Ostensibly
designed to provide a cash stimulus to the Rep.
Theatre business, the club has become a refuge for
high-brows, lone ’Varsity professors and academical
scholars of huge mental displacement. These people
congregate at intervals at the Austral Salon, and over
a bun and a sip of coffee discuss soothing subjects like
“The Psychology of the Frog According to Aristo-
phanes” and “The Botanical Significance of Titania’s
Bower.” They manage to amuse themselves, but
to me, an intrusive stranger, they are inveterate
bores, creating such an atmosphere of classicism
that I feel I am breathing the sacred dust of Euri-
pides, or some similarly-deceased Dago, and ought
to apologise for my impertinence. This year this
brilliant, highly-tutored gang are going to plough
through a syllabus of lectures which, in addition to
including talks on matters having some conceivable
connection with the Repertory Theatre, will embrace
remarks on “The Women of Shakspeare,” the results
of o’Dowd’s researches on “Zenobia’s Counsellor,” and
“Fate in Shakspeare,” for which last Archibald
Strong holds an oratorical contract. Apart from the
facts that Strong is not an entertaining talker, and
is a writer who makes his prose a sepulchre for the
re-interment of long defunct scribes, what bearing
has his discourse on the repertory movement? It is
this shrouding of the repertory idea in the fogs of
scholasticism that drives me to charge the club with
the aforesaid swank. Really there is too much
swank, and swank founded on a drear and soul-dead-
ening Culchaw!
“Geofred”: “Hamer’s” par. re the Actors’ Union
(B. 6/3/’l3) gives one the idea that Broken Hill
and the other “industrial centres” are'biting off
their nose to spite their face, if they are really
adopting the attitude “Hamer” says they are with
regard to union actors. According to the showing of
the Actors’ Union itself, when applying for registra-
tion, its officers belong to practically every trade
except that of the actor. Newspaper scribes and
clerks (take its president and secretary, for in-
stance), plumbers, carpenters, etc., comprise the
committee. It is not likely genuine “actors” are
going to be ruled by this heterogeneous crowd —no
more likely than that a clerk would consent to have
his union affairs ruled by a wharf laborer and a
navvy. This writer believes in unionism, and that
is just why, to him, the idea of calling this an
actors’ union reeks of absurdity. It looks, there-
fore, that the Barrier Labor Federation has two
alternatives —-(1) to banish all but union actors and
Gertie Brown (tvpiste) in the rhles of Romeo and
pay 3s. or so to see Bill Smith (plumber) and
Juliet: or (2) to get some horse-sense, and patro-
nise the genuine show when it comes along, thus
eventually assisting to found k real actors’ union,
comprised of actors and not has-beens and camel
drivers.
Jan Sen, the American conjurer, has fixed up to
make a tour of the “smalls” of Australia, commenc-
ing in Bendigo at Easter. Frank Talbot (who, as
a partner in the now defunct Portus and Talbot
co., imported Jansen, and made much money with
him in Sydney and elsewhere) is in charge, and part
of the appurtenances is a brass band calculated to
shake up even Hobart if it gets there.
M. P. Adams, Australian athlete and frequent
Bulletin contributor, who went with the Olympians
as far as England, blew back to Sydney this week.
Adams came as advance agent for the “Ireland To-
Day” picture and concert co., of which a good deal
has already been heard from Melbourne and Adelaide,
including numerous breathless messages concerning
sworn-to samples of the soil of all the ancient king-
doms gathered rnostlv by Adams’s own hand, and
now available for the feet of the faithful to reverently
tread upon.
“Private Boxer”: Vive Leslie Victor! He is one
of the principals who did not have the advantage of
seeing either “Bella Donna” or “Milestones” in
London, and yet he has managed to make a big
(perhaps the biggest) hit in both plays. Which
proves, if it proves anything, that a brainy actor
can give»a good show without being a servile copy
of the original. Indeed, it is perhaps better for
himself and for his Art not to have seen the original.
“0.K.”: Satisfactory to find local mummer talent
now getting a fair chance in comedy sketches at the
Rickards houses, where hitherto sketch artists ha-e
almost invariably been imported couples—a sprightly
male with an amateurish lady, or vice versa. a
sober, stodgv little comedy called “Pot Luck,” the
acting of George Brvant, Ada Lawrence and Harold
Reeve is particularly good. No exaggeration or
music-hall coloring about it! The three principals
are native-born, George Bryant being the only mem-
ber of the co. who has seen much foreign service. It
is generally known that he was imported from
America by the Williamson firm a few years ago : but
it is generally unknown that he was one of William-
son, Garner and Musgrove’s stock actors in the
early ’Bo’s. Ada Lawrence has rarely had a show in
Sydney or Melbourne, and not one person in a hun-
dred who sees her at the Opera House (Melb.) these
nights knows that she is an experienced Australian
actress who can play the tearful heroine in Camille
and other emotional dramas with more force than
the average imported leading lady. Bryant and
Ada Lawrence, as Bill Sikes and Nancy, should be
able to make any metropolitan audience sit up.
Whv not relieve the frivolity of a vaudeville show
with 15 minutes of Dickens horrordrama?
“Melb”: Julius Knight, in “Milestones,” re-
appears at the Melbourne Theatre Royal after 20
years’ absence from that house. He came there with
the Clifton Alderson and Laura Villiers co., opening,
as second man, in “The Dancing Girl. Then he
ripened in Britain, and returned to Australia as star,
with the “Prisoner of Zenda,” “Sign of the Cross,
“Two Little Vagabonds,” etc.

The demise is chronicled of Geo. Hamil-
ton, of Capertee (N.S.W.), who, it is
claimed, was 110 years old, having, it is
alleged, been born on board the Silver Queen
in 1802 in Sydney Harbor. Unfortunately
there was not a registry office in Sydney in
1802, so official proofs of the exact antiquity
of Hamilton are missing ; and even the Oldest
Inhabitant won’t swear to the age of anybody
over 105.
Sydney Worker has gone mad with admira-
tion for the Canberra capital site, and last
week remarked hilariously that at the time
of the official dedication ceremony, six rivers
on the site were in flood, and sufficient
water was passing down the Cotter to fill
the ornamental lake in 24 hours. It would
have been a ghastly look-out for the place
if its ditches hadn’t been in flood, consider-
ing that the State had just been swept by
the wildest storm for years. The question
is not how much water is on the site after
a torrential downpour—every place has
water then—but how much there will be
half-way through a dry summer. Even
Broken Hill and Booligal have their floods ;
the trouble is that it is such a long time
between floods, and while they are waiting
sun and wind are capable of licking up a
solid 10ft. or 12ft. of the stored moisture in
a single summer.
The story of a tragedy
The spirit of White Australia is further confirmed
in its anti-Mongolian prejudice by £he story of T.
J. Chia, now in chokee in Melbourne on a charge of
attempting to murder the Chinese Consul. Chia
stood for the Asiatic bounder in an advanced state
of Europeanisation. Not that he ever stood still
for any length of time. He dodged about like a
parched pea in a fryingpan—a shallow little pre-
tender, bowing and fussing over the dear, beautiful
ladies ; raising his shiny belltopper and swishing the
tails of his long frock-coat; making always a pre-
tence of having profitable business to attend to,
when he was merely engaged in raising the wind
necessary for restaurant lunches, teas, dinners, sup-
pers and other incidents of a bounder’s brief career.
To most Melbourne men who knew him, or of
him, T. J. Chia was an unpleasant joke. A number
of women and girls took him seriously and thought
him a “charming personality.” The son of a
wealthy Chinese merchant (who had about 20 other
children), this particular Chia was educated in Eng-
land. where he failed to thoroughly master the lan-
guage, whilst contriving: to forget, it seems, a good
deal of his native Chinese. Ilis thin veneer of
scholarship and egregious “cheek” served only to
Thomas Jones Chia.
carry him into minor public
positions, which he failed to
keep. He claimed to have
been headmaster of a “Per-
petual” College at Chang
Choo, and Professor of English
for a year at Pekin Univer-
sity—a very unlikely thing for
him to have been, seeing that
his knowledge of both lan-
guages is defective. He was
probably a secretary for a time
to (he Chinese Commissioner
in Paris, as he stated, and he
certainly was secretary to the
Chinese Consulate in Mel-
bourne. Thus, he came
to marry a very nice girl.
Miss Eunie Russell, a few
weeks ago. As a wooer, Chia
was allee same as the typical
Eulopean adventurer, with one
point of difference. Undoubt-
edly he adored his girl,
Probably he infused his
adoration with the fumes of
opium; certainly he lived in
a dream, taking no thought
for the morrow, save as re-
gards the procuring of suffi-
cient ready-money to keep
his credit going. Months
before his marriage he lost his
billet at the Consulate because
his translation of Chinese
correspondence was unsatis-
factory, but his dismissal was
missprinted as a “resigna-
tion” on account of the death
of his father, the merchant.
Previously the reckless little
“squib” had been borrowing
money from his compatriots
in Melbourne, and now, on
the strength of his late
father’s alleged wealth, he
posed as the inheritor of a
fine fortune, and bounded more
than ever.
The bride-elect and her parents, and a few '‘repre-
sentative citizens” who ought to have known better,
were supreme in their ignorance of Chia’s real Posi-
tion. Everybody else who happened to be in the way
to hear about the young man knew that he was
owing money, buying jewellery and things on credit,
and rushing headlong to the traditional devil in
faultless Eulopean attire. Unfortunately for the
family he married into, the exposure of T. J. Chja’s
social fraudulency ("his father, apparently, having cut
him off with a Chinese shilling owing to his infatua-
tion for an Australian) was delayed by a windfall
of ready cash. After his father’s death he got a
loan of £l2OO from a brother in China for the
purpose of “going into business.” The fact has not
been published hitherto. This money he sDlashed
about in the same old way preliminary to ‘his mar-
riage, and soon after his marriage (last January)
he was un to his Mongolian eyes in financial diffi-
culties. The game of deception was all UP. The
Secretary of the External Affairs Department was
calling upon T. J. Chia to show cause why he should
not be deported to China, having neither official
position nor commercial purpose in this country.
His creditors had started to issue writs against
him, and his nominal reason for calling upon
the Chinese Consul with a revolver in his pocket was
to ask that hard, dry Celestial gent, to givp him
authority to say he was sfill connected with the
o<fice. This reanest the Celestial gentleman natur-
ally refused, and then Chia, so the Consul alleges,
fired the shots that burst his bubble reputation.
The local bounder who woos and wins a girl under
false pretences—incidentally spreading a rumor that
he has inherited a fortune from a relative, as Chia
did —is a common enough person. There are hun-
dreds of him even in this sparsely populated country.
But Thomas Jones Chia is Australia’s first experience
of the Fuloneanised Chow bounder, who maddens
his imagination, probably with onium. He is. in-
deed, a shocking example of the length to which a
nfee white girl will go in letting herself be deceived.
Whatever charm this preposterous little alien pos-
sessed for a section of the sex lav in his abnormality.
Now that he is charged with attempted murder, the
kindest thing his former friends can do for him is to
testify to the lunatically foolish things he did.
SPITE, NO DOUBT.

And stealthily she comes and goes.

To praise her diamonds and lace.

Who spreads these items just for spite.

“Termite” : Fashion’s decrees have not in
the past troubled Darwin residents much —
at least, not the men folk. But things are
changing. After the arrival of Dr. “Jock”
Gilruth, an edict went forth that for Qovt.
House evening functions the correct thing
in future was to be a white hybrid dinner
jacket, an inartistic, inelegant offence, de-
signed to take the place of the time-honored,
neat, comfortable mess-jacket, which had
been in vogue here and in many other tropi-
cal places. Government Hqjjse habitues fell
into line obediently, and the Chinese tailors
reaped a harvest. But we are not finished with
innovations yet. Since his arrival church-
going has not troubled his Ex. over-much;
but last Sunday evening he graced with his
presence the local Methodist Church, where
Dr. Bevan was billed to hold a memorial
service in honor of the heroes of the Scott
expedition. The horse doctor, on this occa-
sion, showed his respect for the place and
the occasion by attending, accompanied by
his secretary, coatless. This naturally set
Port Darwin thinking and talking, and there
is much speculation as to whether “Jock’s”
example is to be taken as a fashion hint.
There is no reason, of course, why a man
shouldn’t go to church in his shirt sleeves,
especially if the weather be on the warm
side; but one shudders to think what would
happen to anyone who would bowl up to

dinner at the ’Ouse similarly attired. Still,
his Ex. may have a very good excuse. Since
the advent of so many officials, the price of
washing has, naturally, gone up consider-
ably, and the dhobies, having more work
than they can conveniently manage, are
more or less unreliable, especially during the
wet season. If Josiah Thomas has any re-
gard for appearances, the sooner he sends
along that steam laundry the better.
Bird’s-eye view of a great occasion
The State entry of Governor Strickland and his
dame into Sydney was one of the most depressing
spectacles 1 ever witnessed. Wear the Governors
office, in Macquarie-street, a large herd of self-con-
scious policemen worried and shepherded a thin
crowd of women, children and street loungers, and
kept carthorses out of the block for fear they would
chew the greenery off the triumphal arch, the un-
necessary obstruction was situated in front of Gov-
ernment House gates, through which, in the old
State days, his newly-arrived Ex. used to drive like
a king or a circus. Probably departmental force of
habit placed it in the old familiar spot. A detach-
ment of the Australian Artillery with a painfully
scratch band clashed along, came to a halt, stood
easy and wearily mopped its collective brow. The
self-conscious policemen shooed the mostly-feminine
crowd back to the kerbstone. There was plenty of
room for everyone; but something had to be done
to fill in time. The crowd-herders were all large,
meaty men, who would have shown up to better
advantage if there had been a surging holiday mob
to hustle, and shove and threaten. The absence of
the surging mob put them at a great disadvantage.
There was nothing to do but order one another about,
take elaborate precautions against impossible stam-
pedes and interfere with scornful carters. Three utterly
miserable policemen stood guard over a patch of
green grass, upon which nobody wanted to trample.
These large, idle men, with white-gloved hands, had
a hunted, apprehensive look. They seemed to be
listening for a fretful voice in the crowd to bark.
The head of the procession appeared at last; it con-
sisted of more policemen—on horseback this time
and bearing naked swords. Behind them trundled
the Gaud Mayor in all his ridiculous millinery, but
without any gas strike shovel. A beadle, or some-
thing, with stripes on its back, sat on the box.
Behind came a stream of unimpressive two-crock
landaus, laden with men who were wearing bell-
toppers and frock coats, and couldn’t forget it. The
crowd knew they were aldermen, because a nuisance
inspector was perched on every box-seat alongside
the grief-stricken driver. The cortege climbed the
hill almost without a sound. A motor, containing
four silent, medalled officers, packed closely, face to
face, whirred past like a clockwork toy. Followed
another funereal horse-chariot, bearing four speechless
naval officers. Then their Excellencies —she, flushed
and excited, bowing deeply and continuously to glum
curiosity; he, gravely saluting stout policemen.
One felt suddenly and overwhelmingly sorry for
them. They needed the surging mob even more than
the unemployed policemen. The dreadful procession
of bell-toppered politicians, sorrowfully a-wheel in
pairs, finally drove me away. Round the corner
they were cheering, thinly and weakly, and the band
was battering out “Gorsave.” Hurrying down the
processional line, I caught an encouraging glimpse
of scarlet, and paused to look into two elderly closed
carriages, about the size of large packing-cases.
They were tightly stuffed with bewigged Judges, who
had been torn from their law jobs and wheeled
into the garish light of day for the amusement of
the crowd. They reminded me that the last person
I saw in a full-bottomed wig was Nell Stewart in
“Old Drury.” Away at the halting tail-end of the
cortege came the Church with its gaiters and spec-
tacles, and the quaintly absurd collars and clothes
that button up the back. Behind the Church, and
last of all, trundled —an empty two-crock landau.
I don’t know what it was supposed to renresent.
Perhaps it was intended for the use of the 24ft. goat-
swallowing python that used to grace Sydney. Last
Friday’s performance has convinced me d) that the
breed of carriage horses is extinct, (2) that the
breed of fine, old wooden-faced coachmen is extinct,
(3) that the workinar time of policemen, Judges,
etc., is often wasted to no purpose, (4) that the pro-
cessional instinct is dead in Australia, and (5) that
State Governors would be happier if they were
allowed to take up their duties with less parish
pomp. Personally, I would rather do a day’s hard
work than salute and bow to blank indifference and
idle curiosity. State Governors henceforward should
demand a guarantee that there will be a surging
mob to cheer them madly, and that the horseflesh is
horseflesh, not mere crockery.
The papers of virtuous John Bull and
wife have been giving a lot of prominence
to what is described as Maoriland’s suicide.
The business is serious enough, for the
birthrate per 1000 married women steadily
declined from 337 in 1878 to 209 in 1911.
Still, things are not quite as black as they
are painted, for while
the births per 1000 of
population fell from
35 in 1882 to 25 in
1899, there has since
then been an occa-
sional rise, and the
figures are certainly
not getting any smal-
ler. Also, owing to
the very low death
rate, the natural in-
crease per 1000 of
population is good,
and shows 17.61
against the Common-
wealth’s 15.02 and
England’s 10.75. So
if Maoriland is sui-
ciding everybody else
seems to be doing the
same, and the land of
John and Johanna
Rull is not far from
the forefront of the
hari-kari.
Melbourne, under Gaud Mayor Hennessy,
is doing things. It has abolished the news-
vendors’ stalls and most of the fruit-hawkers’
barrows, and is getting into the way of toss-
ing its rubbish into tidy wire baskets; also,
it lately fined a vociferous small newsboy for
calling his wares too loudlv. But the dust
fiend still rages, and there is no word about
suppressing the shrieking axle-brake, or the
barking mongrel, or the weird and varie-
gated toot of the unsober motor-horn, or the
rats —quadruned—which continue to pervade
the gutters from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. So there
is still a large opening for Hennessy to bog
into.

If Sydney Evening News is right, Strick-
land, the Ma State’s latest cocked hat,
would make an ideal harbor master or direc-
tor of the ocean. When he set out from
Melbourne in the Cooma, “the passage of
the Rip was scarcely noticeable, and there-
after the sea behaved with remarkable gen-
tleness.” But Strickland evidently tempers
justice with kindness, for, directly he had
landed at Farm Cove, Sydney, and his
weight was off the respectful brine, “the
waters of the harbor danced in wanton blue-
ness.” The loyal wavelets, in fact, leaped
with all the careful abandon of the amateur
ballet in the suburban operatic show.
Melbourne has produced the youngest
Australian stowaway so far. Mrs. David-
son, of Richmond, took her little daughter
Zoe, aged six, by steamer from Port Mel-
bourne to Williamstown a fortnight back.
Zoe had not been on the sea before, and it
was very rough, yet she was in great exul-
tation. A day or two afterwards, instead
of going to school, she went off four miles
to Port Melbourne, There she clambered
up the ladder of the Otway, and hid some-
where aboard. The steamer left for Ade-
laide, and was outside the heads when Zoe
bobbed up on the captain’s bridge, munching
an apple. The wireless was set to work,
and in a couple of hours the mystery of the
remarkable young adventurer was solved.

connection with the connubial effusiveness
of Mormons generally, have decided that
Maffra is too far off their beat, and the hopes
of the Gippsland girls are dashed once more.

The prose poems heaved off of late by the
daily papers in describing the Yassberra
Dry Capital site would have been beautiful
things with a little more sub-editing. As it
was, an occasional harsh note rasped across
the symphony. For instance :
It is doubtful whether so many people have ever
had such a dusty ride. The dustiness really added
to one of the peculiar characteristics of the far-
reaching plains which are enclosed in the city area,
for it is only when it is raining that the country
hereabouts is free from dust.—Sydney Sun
(12/3/’l3). 3
It was a perfect day, absolutely ideal for the occa-
sion. Fine four-horse drags swung along in the
wake of the motors, passing, in clouds of red dust
scores of less imposing equipages As the troops
marched past they continued on to the Duntroon-
road, and cantered back in a cloud of dust to the
camp.—S. M. Herald (13/3/’l3).
The water supply may be uncertain; but
the dust is dead-sure.

Who halted lightly as you roved,
Devised a dream, and made it true,
Dearly beloved!
Yet, though I rest in dear content
Within the arm that clove the way
To win me, one last thought is spent
On yesterday—ah, yesterday !
And, when I kiss, on lips removed
I ponder still, and lightly sigh
Regret for something still unproved—
The love of those who said good-bye,
Nearly beloved !

A FORBES CHILD BAD WITH DIARRHCEA.
“Quite recently my boy Jack was very bad with
diarrhoea,” says Mrs. M. Lee, of Forbes (N.S.W.).
“For quite a fortnight he was ill, and got down very
weak. My husband bought a bottle of Chamberlain s
Colic' and Diarrhoea Remedy, gave him a dose, and to
our surprise the one dose completely cured hum
There 7s no question that this remedy is quick and
reliable.”*

Chief Justice Madden (Vic.), in lately
sentencing a 32-year-old sinner to six months’
hard labor, remarked : “Some men there are
who sit like crows on a rail, waiting for
their chance to take advantage of the
weaker creature as soon as she reaches the
age of sixteen.” Madden, C.J., might have
also observed that some judges there are
who sit like Cyclops on seduction cases,
taking a one-eyed view of the situation.
The writer once heard a theatrical man
speak of the giddy ballet damsels at a theatre
where he was employed as “a lot of young
minxes comparing notes as to how many
days they had to go before reaching the age
of consent.” In their case, anyway, the
weaker creatures offered cordial invitations
to any crows that might have been waiting
around.
Ex-N. S. Wales Governor Chelmsford got
the bull’s-eye at the farewell feed; —
Are we in Australia giving sufficient prizes for
excellence? Is it not a fact that every year there
are many young men leaving Australia because there
are greater inducements in other parts of the world?
Are we doing all that we can to give an incentive to
our artists? And so I think also with regard to
engineers. It is in human nature to look for reward,
and it is good business, I say, on the part of those
in authority to induce the very best to stay.
Why, we import even our State Governors!

The Melbourne public learnt lately with
surprise, and Wowserdom with sorrow, that
the Victorian Government owns a pub—the
Yarra Bank Hotel, just back of the wharves
on the south side of Queen’s Bridge. The
site was originally granted to Robert J. Hil-
liard, who ran a ferry across the river in the
early ’7o’s. He built the hostelry, and when
his lease reverted to the Crown the latter
leased it in 1905 to the Castlemaine brewery
for 21 years at £l5O a year. The brewery
sub-let to the present licensee, and now the
Reduction Board is considering the advisa-
bility of silencing the pump, the establish-
ment being described as “old, dirty and dilap-
idated.” Whether the licensee, the lessee or
the lessor was responsible for this condition
didn’t transpire. Anyhow, if the Govern-
ment wishes to continue in the trade, there
is now a fine chance to transfer its energies
from the Yarra Bank to that long-promised
State hotel at Wonthaggi.
IN DOUBT.
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE: “So you are

N.S.W. Chief Judge in Equity was called
upon last week to solve a conundrum on the
financial aspects of matrimony, and he did
it without calling in the emergency gang.
One Wilson and his wife, by thrift and
amity in the household, had purchased seve-
ral properties, and, in order to save them
from the wolves in case of bankruptcy and
the death-duty in case of his decease, they
were put in his wife’s name. Unfortunately
for Wilson, amity flew out of the window
one day and his an-
noyed smarter-half
claimed the lot. Wil-
son promptly ran
her up to the Su-
preme Court, and
there explained that
the arr a n gement
was merely tempor-
ary or that it was
an honorable under-
standing or some-
thing. The Judge,
however, announced
that, while these hon-
orable understand-
ings to defeat credi-
tors or the revenue,
looked pretty while
they were observed
by both parties, he
had to bring the cold
eye of the Law to
bear on them when
the parties fell out.
In this case, the
land, having been
purchased in the wife’s name, was hers,
and there was nothing else to be said, ex-
cept that Wilson might call in as soon as
convenient and pay off a stack of costs.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Another of the historic estates of Sydney is being
cut up and put on the market. This is Barcom
Glen, at Darlinghurst, the old home of the Wests.
Thomas West came to Sydney in 1800, and was over-
seer of carpenters, etc., in the State’s timber and join-
ery yard. (Ah, those good old times were dreadful So-
cialistic days!) After the establishment was broken
up he started on his own account as a miller, and in
1810 obtained from Goveriior Macquarie the land now
known as Barcom Glen, where he erected the first
water-mill in Australia. The mill was ready for
work in 1812, and was formally opened by the
Governor and his wife. For the name, Barcom Glen,
Macquarie is supposed to have been responsible.

Events are proving, that Dowie’s Zion
was a first-rate business proposition. The
Jews knew that when they stood be-
hind him. In return he stood behind them
and forbade pork. Outside the Melbourne
Temperance Hall, where Dowieism,
or rather Volivaism, still holds forth,
there is posted a copy of the latest
issue of the Zion newspaper, only a
few weeks old, showing that biz is
good. To be sure, the place was nom-
inally sold up; but the mortgagees
continue Elijah’s former Australian
lieutenant, Wilbur Glen Yoliva, in
power. There is no humbugging
pretence any longer of Elijah-ship;
nevertheless, Dowie is honored as the
founder of an excellent shop. Yoliva re-
ports a favorable balance-sheet, with great
prospects of extension. Nothing can better
Zion’s position, on Lake Michigan, midway
between Chicago and Milwaukee. For the
rest, a branch tabernacle is kept up in
Chicago, and the White Robed Choir is
maintained in full fig.

“Harrison O.” : In Melbourne Pirate En-
terprise is sitting on the chest of the birth-
rate in a manner that calls for interference.
A number of house agents have come to a
dishonorable understanding whereby the
man who has helped to populate the State
is heavily fined for his disgraceful conduct.
For each child under 16 years a shilling a
week is added to the rent of his house. Thus
a man with only two “encumbrances” is
penalised to the £s 4s. a year, and
it is proposed to keep “this up for 16 years.
A person with four children can in this way
be robbed of £166. While this spoliation is
permitted, the offer of a baby bonus of £5
is like an attempt to bait an elephant with ;
a caraway seed. , ?
Extracts from a recent semi-heroic narra :
tive entitled “The Rescue of the s.s. Queens-
land off Wilson’s Promontory,” or “On a
Lee Shore”: —
One fireman taken at his home refused point-blank
to put to sea on such a night. Then an effort
was made to make up a crew from the other mem-
bers of the tug-boat crews. More point-.flank refusals
were the' result.
And again:—
When daylight came, the Heads were in sight,
and shortly after 6.30 a.m. the Nyora was abreast
of the signal station. There, to the delight of all
on board, fluttered the signal, “Nyora, return to
Bay ” Captain ‘Mcßain put the helm hard over with
a sigh of regret, and the Nyora went about. “An-
other big salvage job gone,” he muttered. The
men were equally disappointed, but their regret was
tempered with pleasure, etc., etc.
While the scratch salvage crew deserves
some credit for a very wild, wet trip down
the bay in the middle of a shrieking night,
the point-blankers who refused to be heroes
for any earthly consideration, and stayed
resolutely at home, deserve at least to be
treated with resnect. It is very doubtful if
the struggling Nyora could have survived
the boiling Rip, or helped the temporarily
crippled steamer that was depending on the
strength of its anchor chains while the engi-
neers toiled with the broken machinery. The
point-blankers who refused to take the
chances were no more than anti-gamblers who
preferred to stay safely at home, so that they
might resume work unsensationally on Mon-
day morning. The adventurous spirit who
sets out to gather in glorv and gilt is of
course entitled to honor; but there is also
plentv of room for the valiant stay-at-home,
who defies public opinion in bis busted slip-
pers, and states quite plainly his intention
of taking care of himself, his wife and his
children. If all of us were heroes, who
would do the cheering when the medals were
handed out? Also, who would contribute to
the relief funds?
The drivel of the dairymen who have been
yowling to the Food Supply Commission
that the milk standard of N.S.W. is too
high is not likely to deceive anyone. The
dairyman’s plaintive yarn is that he can
only sell milk as good as he gets from his
cows: he can do nothing to enrich it. Which
is true; but it is also true that he can get
better cows. The Australian dairyman, in
the mass, is bitterly opposed to herd-testing

CHANGE.
"And you used io say I was your dearest girl."
"Quite right; but that .was before you developed
into my most expensive woman."
as it is practised in Canada and Denmark ;
but if it were instituted he would soon
know what cows to turn into beef, and what
to keep as milch cattle. Judging by the re-
cent exposures, it is time the Government
went in for herd testing, regardless of the
dairyman’s feelings, in the interests of pub-
lic health; and having tested the herds, it
should legislate to wipe out the cows which
give stuff that looks like milk, but is really
only a bad apology for that article.
A defaulting cadet recently made the un-
successful plea that he was too tired at the
end of the day’s toil to go forth and drill,
and much sympathy has been publicly ex-
pressed for the allegedly weary lad. It may
sound pathetic, but it would have sounded
more convincing had the youngster produced
evidence that he invariably stayed at home
at nights and rested on the verandah, breath-
ing ozone. The youth who is too tired to
drill, but has unlimited energy to rage round
till close upon the noon of night, is the sort
that is likely to increase enormously in num-
bers once tiredness is taken as an excuse.
Had he justified his absence on the ground
that big brother Bill, who is a 10-times
better fighting machine and several times
stronger, is not compelled to drill, he would
{have made a lot of big skulkers look beastly

“0.K.”: Imported Orangeism will never
abate its rancor so long as Holy Church con-
tinues to assert an official relationship to
Irish patriotism, and stimulate Irish pro-
vincial feeling in the Commonwealth. Take
an extract from Archbishop Carr’s circular
letter to the R.C. churches in Victoria, re
St. Pat’s Day:—
This year the celebrations will have a special sig-
nificance. During more than a century these cele-
brations have kept Ireland’s faith and Ireland s claim
to legislative independence before the nations of the
w0r1d.... Here in Melbourne we have yielded to none
in the" fervor of our religious and patriotic demonstra-
tions .... Let us all, priests and people, unite m
securing: one united, great success.
Practically, his Grace the Archbish links
Irish nationalism with Roman Catholicism,
and thereby gives a color of truth to Brother
Snowball’s bleat of “Home Rule means
Rome Rule,” regardless of the fact that the
most effective champion of the cause within
the past 40 vears was Parnell, the Protes-
tant. Patriotism has indeed no religion,
and the true Nationalist wants no priest to
raise his banner for him.

RUM CAMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Liquor is on the prohibited list at the Federal
Capital military camp ; but owing, it is alleged, to
fears of pneumonia, the doctors eventually ordered a
ration of rum to be served out. —Military note.
The red dust made a choking haze where’er a squad-
ron rode;
The dry hills seemed to say no rain had fallen
for a year;
But still, according to the rules, no foaming liquor
flowed,
And resting soldiers drily cursed when comrades
mentioned beer.
Still, loyal at Teetotal Camp, they plodded through
their drill,
Advanced and scouted, charged and wheeled to
husky bugle notes.
The sullen thunder rolled and boomed behind the
driest hill;
The horsemen glimpsed the racing clouds and felt
for overcoats.
Small kitten gusts caught up the dust and threw it
at their eyes;
It played with manes, and tails, and tents, and
rolled things to and fro;
And presently some lukewarm drops came spitting
from the skies ;
The heated air began to cool —the wind began to
blow.
Then came the night, and, while they slept, like
Templars Good and True,
Cloud reinforcements hurried up and roofed wide
Heaven’s arch.
They woke to find a chilly morn, with drapings black
and blue,
And, wrapped in stuffy overcoats, began the usual
march.
The piper blew, the drummer rolled, and, stepping
anyhow,
They started on a straggling tramp across a land-
scape drear;
Damp, overcoated men fell in and splashed behind the
row
Raging beneath the moving sign that shouted “We
Want Deer” !
The O.C. grinned, the Doctor grinned; the Army
Service jumped,
And soon a rattling Service cart drove off towards
Queanbeyan....
With loving care a load of rum it later campward
bumped !....
Before the bugle wailed “Last Post,” ’twas rum
for ev’ry man!
God bless the Doctor and his fears! Pneumonia’s
bad in camp,
But Army Regulations can be made a d—d sight
worse!
Tea-meeting ordinances made for youth and drunken
scamp
May ripen moderate drinkers for the firing squad
and hearse.
But, thank the Lord, who makes His sun to ripen
hops and cane!
The warming liquor came to those who followed
pipe and drum.
Australian soldiers, rise and cheer the beating autumn
rain !
Lord, bless our arms with storms to break the rules
and bring us rum !

“Eddysou” : Tollman is worth £300,000 if
a penny. He owns several large junks of a high-
priced Melbourne suburb, besides great arable tracts
in the country, and lives in a fine demi-mansion, with
superb grounds and a pretentious drive through an
oak avenue. But Pollman himself never uses that
aristocratic entrance. The back gate and a right-of-
way with an asphyxiated cat in it, are good enough
for Pollman. Pollman is a tall, grim, raw-boned man
who lets his hair accumulate because a haircut at Is.
is ruination to a man. He clings to an over-exuber-
ant creeping whisker for economical reasons, too, and
his toilet consists chiefly of some odd boots, a pair
of over-worked pants, and an old roan shirt. The rest
of Pollman’s family lives up to the front view of the
habitation, and dodges about in a motor-car as com-
modious as a ferry, wearing clothes beautiful to be-
hold; but Pollman potters round the garden, putting
snails to death, or nurturing the early potato, or he
massages the cow, or does odd laboring jobs for the
hens. At times he steals out by the back gate,
pushing a crazy barrow with a stub-toed shovel on it,
to go and reduce expenses by executing menial tasks
on his other properties. One morning about a fort-
night back Pollman was slinking along a by-street,
pushing his barrow, when McMahon sighted him.
McMahon is a contractor. He had a building moving
up on an adjacent block. “Hi, you!” called McMahon.
Pollman stopped. “Kim ’ere!” said the contractor
peremptorily. Pollman obeyed. “You want a job,
said McMahon, with the air of a man that would
not be denied. “See here, I’ll give you five bob to
clean up this rubbish and stack it in the corner
there.” Pollman looked up the street and down the
street. “Five and six,” he whispered huskily. “Oh,
very well —five and six. Get down to it.” Pollman’s
family will never know, being away on tour that
dav ; but Pollman took the job.

“Yannatherra” : Puncher was adjectivally
eloquent as he gazed on the bogged tractor and
waggon-load of wheat. The 4ft. of gluey black-soil
creek-bed held the caravan in a devil’s
grip. Puncher poetically consigned
the mud to several unorthodox hells
-by as many unorthodox routes. After
carefully studying the pressure gauge,
he admonished the stoker-driver to
“try the swine now!” The screech of
released steam and a terrific straining
of the old scrapheap resulted, but
never a budge. Just then, I noticed
the pressure was only registering
101 b., and commented on the futility
of the thing. “ ’Sail right,” replied
the engineer. “I’ve screwed the
blanky valve down, and that’s the
second time round.”
“W. Kabe” : With certain reservations I
agree with “Cavalryman” (B. 20/2/’l3) that Aus-
tralia can’t ride. Frank Brown mentions the cattle-
country. Well, I have had a good deal of experi-
ence on perhaps the biggest cattle run in the Eastern
States, and I say that the average Australian even
there is not a horseman in the best sense of the
term. The trouble, in the majority of cases, is bad
hands. As for sheep country—and there is i little
else in N. S. Wales—a man can spend half a lifetime
crawling after the woollies and never learn to ride.
Such jobs as mustering, droving, boundary-ndmg,
etc., entail riding at a snail’s pace, and that is why
there are so many poor horsemen in the saltbush.
They get careless and ride anyhow. It is the last,
rough work, such as cattle drafting, Virumby-runm g,
polo, etc., that begets horsemen; and not one ma
in 20 now in the bush does any of it.
ability to ride buckjumpers is not in itse P
conclusive of horsemanship. As most men on station,
will teU you, rough-riders are, in most cases ™ ,
murderers. The best feature of the Australian
riding is that his seat is a natural and easy one,
due to the fact that he has been accustomed -
spend long hours in the saddle and has learnt to
quite at home there, which makes >t infimtcl
easier for man and horse than if he adopted t
rigid and artificial seat of the riding-schools.
8.J.5.” : Can Australia ride? Rather!
Take the members of the 11th and 12th batteries of
Field Artillery in Brisbane, for instance. Composed
of young Australians who slog a pen or tend a
machine in a big city, one would not expect them
town recruits ’ —to be able to handle horses de-
cently ; yet the writer, who has attended five annual
camps of training, has seen the young fellows hand-
hng horses in a manner which makes one feel proud
o >eing in their company. There were merry times
when the animals were first placed in a gun-carriage.
Hardly a team drew out but that a general mel6e
ensued. The lead horses bucked for all they were
worth, and then turned and mixed up in the general
fun with the polers. But the boys stuck, and always
managed to get into camp. You can’t beat the
young Australian. He comes up smiling every time,
and he of all men knows how to adapt himself to
circumstances. Last camp of training (1912), at
Tambourine, one of the finest and pluckiest bits of
horsemanship that one could delight in seeing was
shown by three boys. The gun was brought into
position, but in freeing the horses some of the har-
ness became tangled, the animals took fright, and
away they galloped. It looked certain death for one
at least of the boys. But they kept cool, and eventu-
ally brought their steeds to a standstill. Six mad
horses controlled by three boys! No wonder there
was a cheer. Then again when Kitchener was pre-
sent at the big camp at Lytton, a squadron of Light
Horse took up such a position after negotiating
some tricky country that the iron-jawed organiser
had to admit that he had never seen such an example
of horsemanship. Yet the outback horsemanship is
still more amazing. On the stations they breed a
race of men that no other country in the world can
show. They are in the saddle from daylight to dusk,
riding over the ranges and round the runs. Talk
about hunting! You can crowd more dangers into
one minute in chasing brumbies in the scrubby
ranges than you could get if you spent a whole life-
time chasing the fox; and I would lay my last
penny on a squadron of A.L.H. losing the most
crack squadron of cavalry there is in Europe.
“Mr. Ocky” : This place is over-run with
insane creatures. Since the first cat arrived (there
are now seven) the rats and mice have increased
enormously, and live in the utmost accord with the
purring maniacs who are hogs for milk. Their head-
quarters are in the front room. Five cockatoos sit
on the roof. To-day they pulled the spouting off
and dropped it on the milk-jug, uprooted the prize
dahlia, and dismembered the fence. I shall never
forget their howls of execration when I protested.
The horse refuses to be harnessed, and the cow has
made off towards the river to commit suicide. Also,
the three choicest fowls have wandered to the next
street, whilst the fourth-best is trapped underneath
the house and calling out like the very devil. Pro-
bably she has caught a snake. Since I came here I
have murdered four snakes, my three biggest
dogs are barking at 11 others beneath the wood-
heap. There are half a dozen magpies in the gar-
den ; they all rise at 4 a.m. to say grace over the
slugs, but as the slugs throw off the bedclothes at
3 a.m., the vegetable crop won’t be much good
this year. Every season I watch the cherries get
ripe, and so do the sparrows and starlings. There
are innumerable canaries, parrots, pigeons, etc.,
to be fed, and the increased cost of living does not
worry them. This is also the resort of cicadas,
crickets, youngsters selling concert tickets, hawkers,
Salv’army collectors, organ-grinders, mosquitoes, and
so many other pests that 1 begin to think life is
hardly worth the battle.

INFURIATED WELSH BOSS (sacking workman) : "An' if you wass to be tam well hung

The story of a goldfields election: —
Howard Snips was one of the big men on Cool-
gardie, when he was nominated for a seat in the
Leg. Council. His opponent was a down-country
man; but the vote on the field was strong enough
to return Howard—-if the vote could be got to the
poll. This was the trouble; prospecting was pro-
ceeding ; and many men whose names had been placed
on the roll had drifted too far away to be got in
time.
On the day of polling it was fairly clear the fields
were beaten. The farmers’ vote would be polled
solid for the farmers’ man, and the miners’ vote
could not be got in. Snips was a sport, and if the
reasonable expenditure of money could have varied
the position as it presented itself at the last moment,
he would have played up the shekels like a prince.
About one o’clock on the day Scotty came to the
booth. Jack Moore was a scrutineer for Snips.
“Hallo, Jack,” Scotty called out. “How’s it
goin’ ?”
“No good,” said Jack. “We haven’t got the men
here, and we’re going to be left.”
“Let’s have a look at the list.” Scotty took up
a roll and saw a number of names on the first page,
ticked off as absent.
“Say,” he said, “these men are not absent. Most
of ’em’s workin’ down at the King Solomon. I’ll go
and bring ’em up.”
In half an hour he was back with 10 or a dozen
men, and a string of others following.
With the roll in one hand, and a pencil in th.e
other, he called a name for the first of his party.
“‘John Henry Smith, Accountant,’: that’s you,
Peter,” he said to the big Norwegian at his elbow.
“You go right in and vc <. ‘Henry Wilkinson, En-
gineer’—that’s vou, AlicK. When the Warden asks
you, just say ‘Henry Wilkinson, Engineer,’ and go
right along and vote.”
Scotty polled a big Snips vote before the after-
noon was fairly bitten into, and would have gone on,
but for the mislabelling of one of his force.
" ‘Reginald Waters, Civil Engineer,’ ” he read
from the roll. “That’s you, Hennessy,” he said to a
big Irish person across whose features “Pat was
written in large type, and “navvy” in smaller
letters.
The Warden challenged him: “Is your name Regi-
nald Waters?” lie asked.
“It is,” replied Pat.
“And you’re a surveyor?’
“I am that.”
“I wouldn’t vote, if I were you,” said Finnerty.
“All right, Warden,” was all Hennessy had to
say, before adopting the suggestion “ ’Twas Scotty
towld me Snips would be beat if I didn t put in a
vote for him.” , .. ... ~
But the Snips poll was, by now, so big that the
down-countryman could not have headed him in any
circumstances, and, by common consent, the auxili-
aries were drawn off.
Prior to proceeding to where the barmen were
believed to be operating, Scotty, standing up in his
cart his face shining with a great light such as is
seen’ sometimes on the features of a man who has
done the State good service, called out to Jack
Moore across the booth: “Ef there s any chance o
bein’ short on the figures, John, gimme some more
names, I got any God’s quantity o voters.
“Young Feller” : I’ve captured the King
Mug. He’s fresh from Middlesex (Eng.). They
brought him up here secretly, and put him on a bit
of land, with strict injunctions not to leave it till
he had made his fortune. The land produces an ex-
cellent kind of red gibber, invaluable for slinging at
policemen, but it is too far removed from the world’s
markets to permit of the crop being immediately
negotiable. ’Enery ’Awkins trotted over to my
place on Sunday. He has 16 pearlies on his best
coat, and walks like a man thrusting a handcart full
of herrings. I was dusting my spike-haired terrier
with insectibane, and ’Enery watched me with in-
creasing interest for some minutes. Then said he,
with the air of a man who could contain himself
no longer: “Gorstruth, cully, that stuff ain’t to kill
dorgs!”
DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE HIS BEER.
HOPLADEN : “ Please, sir, are you a Wowser?'
TRACTS : " Good heavens! What makes you

This must have been about the year 1822 (wrote

The first of the 1913 open winter motor-bike trials

the Bournemouth and district M.C.C. This competition
attracted a large entry, including practically all the
well-known makes. Out of 55 starters -only four
solo machines secured maximum marks, and the fact
that the 8.5. A., ridden by a private owner, was
amongst the four to secure a gold medal speaks

B.S.A. 34-h.p. motor bicycle is one of the most re-

doubtedly a successful future in store for motor

Pa Pooa : The boss had intermittent
fever, and as that does not tend to improve one’s
temper we tried to look busy. Suddenly the boss
found an opening. “Smith!” he bawled, “what
the ? ? ? ?? ? ? do you mean by taking those
stores of Ellis’s back ?” Smith explained that Ellis
owed the firm a fair bit, and as he had done no
good on the field he (Smith) thought the best thing
to do was to take back some of the
stores, and reduce the debt that way. “Best
thing be damned!” yelled the boss. “What the
! ! !’s the good of the stuff to us now! It’s been
hawked all over the Waria and Mambare, and there
won’t be a label left on a tin, and the ’ll be
in for fresh tack to get down on to Cloudy Bay
with. Then followed a description of unsuccessful
prospectors and a final order to get the returns out
for inspection. Smith proceeded to comply, and
finally announced that the supplies were on the
counter. Unfortunately he failed to put the meats
out of reach of the stray sun-rays which came in
through the skylight. No self-respecting tin of
Luncheon- Beef can bear sun-boiling and fermenting
more than seven times, so three tins of Ellis’s
nd-urns burst with indignation and a loud report.
The boss grabbed his revolver, thinking that some
cutting playful, just as a semi-
solid mass of outraged meat shot across the store
and deposited some of itself in the office. I
beat the boss to the door by three inches. “Who
the *** did that?” he demanded, brandishing the
revolver under the nose of Smith. Smith explained,
and the boss swore afresh. “Where’s the store
‘boys’?” he bellowed. “They went out the back as
soon as it happened,” said the assistant. “Agita?
Agita ? Yes, Taubada. ’ “Where the roses-and-
lavender have you been? Here, get inside there and
clean up that mess!” “Me no want ’im, Taubada.
Bull-a-ma-cow he been dead long time, he stinnik.”
I admired the grace with which the “boy” dodged
the boot with the boss’s foot in it, and standing at
a respectful distance repeated, “Me no want ’im,
Taubada. Me no want ’im.” The boss looked as
if he was going to burst, and we all hung back
expecting things. Taking two strides to the door
he grabbed his nose and advanced the remaining
distance with levelled revolver. Taking hurried
aim at the fysol shelf he let drive. At first I
thought him successful, but the assistant groaned
Then I knew the bullet had found the whisky depart-
ment. Five more shots followed in quick succession, and
several bottles of pickles, a ham and a pair of boots
suffered considerably. The boss retired temporarily
defeated, and I felt rather uncomfortable when the
assistant animadverted on the markmanship. Re-
loading he again advanced with a determined look,
and revolver and nose held fast. Providence directed
the second-last bullet into a case of trade scee. r ,
and we breathed at last.
“Wal” : Poor old “Platman” has had his
leg extended by the aborigines of the Cook district,
or else he would never have made the rash state-
ment about the boomerang being unknown there
HALL MARKED.
“Do you think the old bloke can ride, Joe?"
“Ride? Why them legs speak for themselves.
I'd like to ' ave a quid for every buck-
jumper 'e's rode in is time , and charnceit."
(B. 13/2/’l3). Speaking as a man born in Cook-
town I can say with authority that the boomerang
was used most freely when I was a boy, and if it
is not in favor now it may be only due to the fact
that a tomahawk is easier to obtain. Many and
many times have I seen boomerang-throwing com-
petitions held on the racecourse outside Cooktown.
Whether the competitors were natives of the dis-
trict I would not say; but that the boomerang is
known by the aborigines of that district is positively
unquestionable.

“The Hager”: A note on the fecundity of
the death adder. At Six-mile farm, Milmerran
(Q.), Harry Simmons found himself the other day
in uncomfortable proximity to one .of the hated
vermin. The vermin attempted to crawl away, but
was pilled. Its extraordinary size aroused curiosity,
so an operation was performed and 22 young live
adders were found camped in the home paddock.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
JACKEROO (who has peppered the tree): “I—er—wonder if I hit him that shot?"
TOMMY (the blackboy): “My oath! Look at all the fedders.”
“Eryander” : “Mallarapoonie’s” bat-adven-
ture (B. 27/2/’l3) reminds me that I was supposed
to have cashed a large draft upon my imagination
when I introduced a similar incident into one of
my Malaysian yarns, and that much superior
“pooh-pooh!” was expended over the idea of a man
being capsized by a bat. Now, the kalong (Pteropus
javanicus ) of those parts—a gigantic cousin of our
own flying-fox—measures often sft. in
wing-spread, and when a few hundreds
of him —but here is what actually oc-
curred. Three of us had poked a good
way into one of the curious limestone
caves common in south-western Borneo,
and one of the party proposed to dis-
charge his revolver in order to get the
strange acoustic effects which would fol-
low. “Better not,” he was advised.
“You would probably bring out a hur-
ricane of bats.” “Bats!” he repeated
contemptuously and fired. “Down
flat!” I jerked out, and in a few seconds
they were upon us, filling the air with
stink unspeakable, flapping out our
damar-torches, and leaving us in pitchy
darkness, through which came groans
from the injudicious powder-burner. My
other mate and myself had escaped pretty
well, because the bulk of the tornado
had passed over us, but our over-confi-
dent friend had been bowled over like a
ninepin, and had hit his head hard
against the rocky floor. We said nothing
about a damfool, but the back of that
fellow’s skull was pretty eloquent upon
that point for weeks afterwards.
“McNorth” : Most of us who live in the
extreme north of Australia agree with the sentiments
expressed in “Gerald Barker’s” par (B. 23/l/’l3)
on the extermination of Binghi. Binghi is a para-
site and a nuisance. In his native state he is little
better than a dingo. He wakes in the morning,
picks up the tracks of a bandicoot or a wallaby or
something, runs it down, cats it and then sleeps till
hungry again. He has no habitat, no gardens, no
anything. As a workman he is, at best, a makeshift.
We who live in the outposts, away from civilisation,
have enough to contend with without having our camps
robbed and our cattle speared by irresponsible or
other niggers. The doctrine of their gradual exter-
mination by letting them alone is not as harsh a
creed as the uninitiated who live in the South may
think. We in the North know. A Biughi can never
be anything but a Binghi. How many times
has the experiment of educating him up to the
white man’s standard, by missionaries and others,
been tried with the same result —-failure!' He
absorbs the white man’s vices but not his virtues.
A race belonging to the palaeolithic period cannot be
raised in one lift to the conditions of the present
time, and if the process is made gradual the original
species is lost and a new breed evolves. Mornington
Island, the only terra incognita in Queensland, is
to be the scene of the next educational experiment.
When a missionary edifice has been there for a few
years the nigger’s course of trouble will commence.
Better let him alone. He’ll go to his destruc-
tion fast enough without tobacco, clothes, European
tucker and religion.
“Lou” explains how to get rid of rabbits:
This recipe is mostly for the strenuous grafter
with a large family on a small holding.
First to be dealt with are the single rabbits, who
live m unpretentious burrows, with one, two per-
haps three openings. Get up early, and, arrived at
the first burrow, locate yourself on the roof. Send
the missus out about three chains. Get her to buck
about, waving her arms wildly, screeching her best,
and working in a circle round the underground
airair 11ns will scare any wandering rabbits, who
promptly make for cover. As soon as the last one
is in, rush home, seize the shovel I forgot to tell
you about, gallop backhand fl.ng it at the rabbit
that is coming out again. But mind the missus.
W hen they are all in, fill in the holes with the loose
earth that is outside the burrow, ram it well with
the shovel handle, and hean loose earth on top of
each hole. Treat all the smaller homesteads alike:
then go and get a feed. While you are away the im-
prisoned bunnies commence to scratch for daylight.
1 , ,! 00 ® e falls in; some smother, some get out,
but having filled in their own domiciles, are obliged
to hire a room with the married rabbits.
Now get some common tar in a kerosene tin, and
gather up the straw envelopes that were on the
bottles of beer. Try and remember where you left
the shovel, and sally forth with the missus to deal
row’s the m ° re pretentious and thickly- populated bur-
„7,Arriy,ed the first, let the missus go mad again.
When they are all in, fray the wide end of the straw
envelopes, dip them in the tar, shove them down
into the holes, and fill in around each with earth,
treat all the big burrows alike. After a while the
inmates commence to scratch, pick up first the tar
and then the sand, and come out with their feet
asohalted. This reduces their speed a good deal and
prevents them cleaning out their homes. Leave the
nussus to fill in the holes when the last man is out,
dash home,. shove the steed into the spring cart, fling
a pig net in, swoop down on the township, gather a
pack of dogs, dump them in, fasten the pig-net
securely, give the steed a (climb in yourself first)
terrible fright, and make back for the selection.
Arrived home, the first thing to do is to get out
of the cart. Do this carefully. As soon as you hit

“Henry Horsecollar” : I am a-wearied of
this clamor for the preservation of “aboriginal
names.” Nine times out of ten there weren’t any.
Just consider the reason of names. They are wanted
to define cities, towns, villages and hamlets. They
also serve to locate on the map roads and cross-
roads, castles and fortresses, great battlefields, farms,
cattle and sheep stations, the sites of fairs and mar-
kets, rivers, fords, mountains and sundries. The
aborigine had no map. He had some rivers, fords,
mountains and sundries, but he had none of the
other things. So he probably had very few names.
Take the Sahara as an example. It is a
vast place, but the name of most of it was
just plain Sand. The French are sinking wells, and
finding water, and creating scraps of fertility, and
raising towns; but it is no use asking the native
for the aboriginal name of the scrap when it is
created. You might as well ask him to state the
name of one particular square foot of the sky or
one particular square inch on the top of a big table.
The theory that every place had an aboriginal name
even before it was a place seems to me like sheer
foolishness. Of course there is always some wild
humorist who comes forward with a ready-made
legend, which he gets some wild myall of Ballarat
or Rockhampton to endorse for the price of a pair
of beers, but the wild humorist isn’t to be taken
seriously.
“Polish” : Re Frank Brown and his “out-
back horse-breakers” (B. 20/2/’l3). Has he ever
bought animals out of outback mobs sold as broken?
Not 5 p.c. of such animals can be caught outside of
a “crush” ; practically all are “halter-breakers”
when you get them on a halter; and
directly the girths are tightened, the fun
(for onlookers) commences. As to pick-
ing up a leg of one of these nags, or
combing a tail, I’d sooner stand a round
with Johnson than attempt any one of
tue three. No! Brute strength of thighs
and calves, combined with recklessness,
does not constitute horsemanship. I’ve
seen a monkey in a circus remain on a
pig-rooting Australian outlaw, but was it
a horseman? Attend outback pubs, semi-
outback picnic meetings and shows, and
study equine education, and the further outback you
get the worse it gets. Bring a real “outbacker"
inside civilisation, and you’ll find nine times out
of 10 that has to be re-broken, and, worst of all,
re-mouthed.
* * * *
“Condamine”: In the interests of suffer-
ing animals I’m with those who have been trying to
wean a congregation of Outback fools from the
barbed wire habit. I have had experience (too much
of it) with all kind of wire, an-’ I say that three
good plain strands are as effec:r, e as two of the
barbed variety. The barbs are necessary in three
places only: (1) On top of a netting fence to keep
dingoes back ; (2) Underneath netting to remonstrate
with nosing pigs and ’roo rats; (3) Round the
water-holes along the Cotter bed to keep the rabbits
from drinking the water with which Brother Den-
man will christen the Federal capital.

wasn’t the same old

about hi s all-but

contrary, he was
quite English ; and
the hundreds of ex-
iled Australians who
packed themselves
into the air-tight
compartment of the
Colonial Institute,
expecting to be
thrilled as of yore
by the dear old
squeak, were badly
done-in. Instead of
sturdy Australian
sentiments, he quav-
ered cheap jingo-
ism, and the good
old flag was waved
until it was nearly
in ribbons. The
truth is, the High
Commissioner was
talking up to the
Colonial Institute,
which prides itself
on its British tone;
for George has
learned to play up
to his host. The In-
stitute, by the way,
intends to make
Wattle Day an

The Salv’army in Adelaide claims to have
made its champion convert in Sarah Fran-
cisco, aged 72. Her police-court convictions
run to 295. nearly all for drunkenness. The
P.M. and the force simply did not know what
to do with her. The Army took her in hand,
and asserts that she has not touched liquor
for nearly a vear. The local War Cry,
boasting of the case, cheerfully labels Sarah
‘ the worst woman I have ever known.”
From Burke, junior :
Apropos “the unhappy Chaipberlain” (B. 13/3/’l3)
who had to decide where to place the knife-and-fork
at Melbourne Government House, for the incoming
and outgoing N.S.W. Governors. It is worth taking a
look at the status of the parties indicated. The first
Chelmsford, Frederick Thesiger, was a son of Charles
Thesiger, Collector of Customs at St. Vincent, an
island in the West Indies—a little place 18 miles
long and 11 wide, about the size of a large bed-quilt
Columbus found it in 1498. When Thesiger I. was
Collector of Customs it was a slave State. The salary
of the Collector would be small. To-dav its Chief
Justice gets only £650, and the Chief Clerk in the
Treasury £2OO. The Collector’s son, first Baron
Chelmsford, was a middy, and served at Copenhagen,
but he left the sea and became a lawyer, was lucky,
and got into Parliament in 1840 for a little place
called Woodstock, which does not now return a mem-
ber. Luck followed him: he became Solictor and
Attorney-General, and in 1858-9 and 1866-8 was
Chancellor in the Tory Governments of Earl Derby.
When Disraeli came into power he did not take
Chelmsford into his Councils, but allowed him to
enjoy his pension of £5OOO a year as an ex-Chan-
cellor. He died in 1878, and was succeeded by his
eldest son, Frederick Augustus Thesiger, who, from
be'ng an ensign in the Rifle Brigade, became a full-
blown commander. In that capacitv he directed
affairs in the Kaffir and Zulu wars (1878). The story
of Rorke’s Drift and the awful slaughter of the
British makes interesting and gruesome reading. Thi=
warlike peer died in 1905, and was succeeded by the
late Governor of N. S. Wales, who at the time of
his appointment to the Governorship of Queensland
was a barrister. The wife of the present peer is a
daughter of the first Baron Wimborne, whose family
name was Guest. They are prettv well-to-do. The
Wimborne peerage was created in 1880. Now for
the Stricklands. Sir Gerald was in the Roval Malta
Militia ; he was born on that island, and had various
official positions. His wife, Ladv Edeline Sackville,
is a daughter of the seventh Earl De La Warr. That
family was ennobled in 1299 by Edward I. Sir
Gerald Strickland’s family dates back to the same
period. Members of it for seven generations repre-
sented Westmoreland, from the first English Parlia-
ment until the reign of Elizabeth. An ancestor of
S : r Gerald, Sir Thomas Strickland, carried the banner
of St. George at Agincourt. The seat of the family
Sizergh Hall, in Westmoreland, has a “Queen’s
Room,’’ which is said to have been occupied by
Catherine Parr, one of the wives of Henry VTTI.
No wonder, faced with two such diverse records, that
Lord Dicky Nevill found himself with a tough
problem to solve when it came to laving the table.
The singing of the “Old Hundredth” at
the christening of Canberra recalls that
before he came to Australia and took to in-
surance drumming, Kink O’Malley was in
business as an evangelist in America. A
man from Australia who recently called in
at Portland, on the Pacific Slope, was inun-
dated with inquiries about the former Bible-
thumper, news having spread in those parts
that he was nowadays a Cabinet Minister in
the Commonwealth. As a “revivalist” show-
man of the true Yankee pattern, Portland
still remembered the Kink as just It.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos the lady chemist (B.
6/3/T3). N. S. Wales has had two —one
at Carcoar, widow of an old apothecary, who
carried on the business after hubby’s death;
the other, in business at Liverpool, had
studied on her own account. This writer,
by the way, once went to a Sydney whole-
sale house with an order from the Liverpool
lady, but the house would not supply her, on
the ground that it would give no encourage-
ment to any woman to enter this holy calling.
South Aus. has definitely recognised the
claim of John Ridley to the invention of the
wheat-stripper, and has put up a marble bust
of him at the Roseworthy Agricultural Col-
lege. Ridley was in Australia only from
1840 to 1853. He brought out the 'State’s
first steam engine, and ran its first flourmill.
His claim to the invention of the harvester
has sometimes been questioned, but he
always declared that 4he only help he got
was a hint from a Roman machine described
in an Encyclopaedia. His original con-
traption (which was pushed by two horses
irom behind) has since been improved out of
recognition, but in 1845 it was thought a
marvel, and it straightway brought down the
cost of harvesting from 2s. a bushel to 4d.
Excellent judgment was displayed bv an
immigrant’s offspring that first saw the light
on board the Themistocles. The interesting
event was taking place while the boat was
cautiously feeling its way through the dark-
ness towards Cape Otway. The three-mile
limit had just been passed when the denoue-
ment was effected, which meant the addition
ot one to the native population of Australia
and the paying out of another bonus. Had
the infant elected to be born a few minutes
earlier it would have been a native of
btepney (Eng.).
“Horse Millinery” says a word for a man
who hasn t many champions :
Putting aside the appointment of Powers to the
Hlgl J c ° urt Bench, the Sydney Bar leaders did
snort when they learned that Piddington, a local
young man, was also to soar over their heads to the
f lt T a !, e< ' Perch. They snorted the worse because they
had it all arranged in their own minds that one of
their very popular K.C.’s was “a cert.” In fact,
the terms of felicitation had even been whispered
1 would take more notice of these groans if f
hadn t heard them twice before. Once they were
uttered when Prmg was called up, and, later, when
the now-eminent Street was lifted to Mas Supreme
Court. Now, if you asked them, the men who did
the groaning would have to admit that those two
are as sound Judges as we have in N. S. Wales.
In connection with the centenary of the
of a wav over the Blue Mountains
UN.b.vv.), one deserving man gets far less
mention than a heap of ancients who did
little or nothing for the West. For 16 or 17
years after the Ma State got Responsible
government, all that part of the country
(Last Macquarie) was represented by Wil-
liam Cummings, who had William Suttor as
a colleague most of the time. Cummings
had a beautiful brogue and no education,
but he was popular in the House and the
smoke-rooms, and he
lobbied and log-rolled
incessantly on behalf
of the district behind
the mountains. The
railway was a dream
of his, and he bar-
racked for it day and
night, and roped in
the strong support of
W. B. Dailey and
others. Of course, the
line would have come
in time, in any case;
but the quaint old
man with the readv
tongue certainly
brought it years
nearer.

the voyage Mr. Knight took lessons in farming from
an expert agriculturist on board.— News item.
Once, when converting burglars,
And with a sneak-thief singing hymns,
Showing him ways beyond the stars—■
Celestial paths the Bible limns,
To chase all scandal from my way,
I killed a Bishop every day.
Chaplain was I to the Condemned,
Who waited for the awful rope;
’Twas I his long despairing stemmed,
’Twas I who spoke of heavenly hope,
’Twas I who took my splendid stand
With him, the murderer, hand in hand.
And, when calumnious tongues assailed
Me for the company I kept,
Though conscious virtue unavailed,
I neither pled, nor prayed, nor wept;
I laughed at every scand’lous cur,
And—killed the executioner.
And, so you see, my ways are pure.
In our small cabins did we pray
That our simplicities endure—
Our god-like virtues wax each day :
And when I think what in me lies,
The salt tears come into mine eyes.
Yes! when I th-'nk how good I be—
How bravely I did run away,
And left my brolly by the sea,
And left my wife to say her say—
How bravely faced anew the years,
My goodness fills mine eyes with tears!
So, in this sunny Southern land,
Vn here comes all good—and evil too—
I’ll take my partner by the hand
To face the work we have to do.
Careless of scandal, lies or sport,
I’ll grow tomatoes by the quart.
For, on the ocean, did I take
Lessons from one who, I insist
Was wise as I, and free from fake—
A high-seas agriculturist.
Sister! the Lord shall walk with us,
And we will grow asparagus.
Full virtuous shall our onions be,
And passing true our artichokes;
Honest our budding broccoli,
And grown but for high-minded' blokes;
And, when the evening light is dim,
I’ll fork manure, and sing a hymn.
For I am good, and not as ye,
And scandal shall not blight the spud ;
My sins all washed away at sea,
I rise triumphant from the mud:
And in my melon-patch I sit,
A nice, imported hypocrite.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The N. S. Wales Government, which must
Oorrow or burst its boom, has arranged with Uncle
Bull for another £3,000,000 at 4 p.c., to be issued
it 98, and repayable in 10 years. Last year the
State Mieawber borrowed £2,000,000 on 12 months
bills, and no doubt some of the present little lot
will go towards repaying that temporary loan. In
addition to paying £4 a year as interest on £9B
and undertaking to pay back £lOO at the end of 1 0
years, the desperate State also agrees to pay a full
half-year’s interest in October, though the final in-
stalment of the principal doesn’t have to be put up
until May. These concessions, plus underwriting
and other charges, will bring up the cost of the
money to about £4 7s. p.c. —a terrific price to pay
for accommodation, seeing that it is repayable in
10 years, wherefore the security is far better than
that of long-dated loans. If there is going to be a
composition and a smash, obviously the Cohen who
has to collect in 10 years will stand a far better
chance of escaping the catastrophe than the Levi
whose bill isn’t payable for 30 years. And on top of
the high rate payable to Cohen there is the high
rate payable for almost everything that will be
bought with the borrowed coin. So the public is
going to get unusually poor value for very expensive
money. However, the bogus Labor crowd in office
in N. S. Wales seems to realise that its one hope
at the coming general election is to borrow no
matter at what cost—and maintain the artificial
prosperity. The trouble is that the farther the pen-
dulum swings that way, the farther back _ will it
swing presently ; and that backward swing is going
to be a very painful business for a lot of people.

If only for the fact that year after year it puts by more
than half its profits, this co. earns this paper’s bless-
ing. Also, for the same reason, it deserves the pub-
lic’s business, because every addition to the funds
laid by gives the insurer further assurance that the
till won’t be empty when he calls round to collect
his money after the fire or the wreck. And the
position is really all the stronger because the rapid
accumulation of reserves hasn’t been accompanied
by any furious increase of risks. Premiums paid
are the only available measure of risks taken;
theoretically (and the theory is based on long ex-
perience) a year’s premiums cover a year’s risks,
plus expenses and a bit over for the shareholders.
Vow this shows (among other things) what the
premiums are:—

Capital is £75,000 and reserves £126,250; and
together they are equal to 22 p.c. of the premiums
—-'which is a position much stronger than the average.
Put in another way, if the co. were at once hit by
.a disaster as great as all the big and little disasters
of the past five years put together, it could pay the
■ claims, assuming, of course, that the investments
■ realised 20s. in the £. As for those investments,
they certainly don’t please this paper very well. Of
the co.’s funds, no less than £106,705, or about
■one-half, is out on mortgage, £50,630 is in un-
specified debentures and £20,549 is in properties;
and that doesn’t leave much liquid—about £40,000.
It is ample, no doubt, if nothing abnormal has to
tbe met; but an insurance co. can’t afford to build
<on that. The bait which lures the co. on to tie up
its money is the high rate of interest earnings.
Last year the investments brought in a shade over
•4 i pc. all round, and provided enough for an 11
p.c. div. —a very cheerful result. All the same,
•there must be risks in this sort of investment; and
the balance-sheet would look all the better for a re-
serve against the depreciation of assets. Otherwise
there is no visible smudge on the accounts.

Steamship cos.’ accounts generally leave a good deal
to the imagination ; and this new concern—it was
a private co. previously—isn’t going to differ from
the rest. The prospectus offered the outfit to the
public for £750,000, payable in shares—half of
them 6 p.c. cumulative pref. ; the other half ordinary.
The public was invited to subscribe 125,000 prefs.
•■and 125,000 ordinaries, all of £1 each; and there
\w&« a scramble to get in. On these ordinary shares
10s. was paid down and 10s. on July 1. The assets
were valued at £751,404. That provided a reserve
of £1404 to start with. On the other hand, pre-
liminary exes, ran to £4969; so there was a net
■deficit of £3565 when the new co. took down the
shutters. Net earnings for the year are alleged by
(the Profit and Loss account to have been £74,358.
But a reserve fund of £3354 appears in the balance-
sheet along with an insurance fund of £16,709. In
the infant table printed above, these amounts have
been added to the profits, although, admittedlv, an
insurance fund isn’t necessarilv profits laid by.
Sometimes it is an amount to the credit of a fund
created to cover risks which are still current; just
as often, especially in good times, it is a stocking
into which profits are dropped furtively. Then
there is the big question of depreciation. Five per
cent, or so of the cost of steamships ought to be
written off every year to provide for replacements;
and obviously a co. by writing off more or less than
5 p.c. can whittle down the profits in the one case
and inflate them in the other. It is impossible to
even guess at what this co. writes off. Ship pro-
perty is dropped into the accounts “at valuation” ;
also there is a reserve for “contingencies, deprecia-
tion of property and shares in other cos., repairs
and renewals, superannuation fund,” and other
things. This so-called reserve totals £30,849.
Some of it was taken over from the old proprietary
co. A part of it may be a genuine reserve, but since
another part of it certainly isn’t—the superannua-
tion fund, for instance—it isn’t shown in the table.
Nothing very definite can, therefore, be said about
the co.’s first year. It certainly looks as though the
dividend has been very easily earned (on the ordin-
aries the co. paid 6 p.c. for the first half and 8 p.c.
for the second). But of the surplus of £31,766, a
good amount may not be genuine profit. On the
other hand, the co. has no less than £432,046 of
“Government and other debentures, Government
stock, fixed deposits and other investments,” in
addition to the value of “shares in other cos.” and
current account money ( £11,054). The size of
this more or less liquid item suggests that the co.
has a big amount of capital which may be put to
more profitable use presently. The liabilities total
£124,080. About half of it is deposit money; no
doubt this will be paid off as the deposits become
due. A lot of repayment has been done already out
of subscribed capital; when the co. was formed
£201,642 was owing to shareholder-depositors. The
co. has thus the means available for the considerable
expansion of business which was forecasted in the
prospectus. No doubt things have been unusually
good in the inter-State and Maoriland trade; and
even if things keep as good, which is unlikely, costs
have lately been running up. Nevertheless, the
general tendency will be in the direction of a bigger
trade. Take this into account; add the fact that a
large amount of the co.’s capital can’t have earned
much ; and the size of the profits for the first year
seem then to justify shareholders in thihking that,
they have struck something pretty good.

There are two classes,of shares —“subscription” and
“paid up.” You can pay 3s. lOd. a month for 15
years, or larger amounts up to 14s. lOd. a month for
five years, and thus purchase a £5O share; or
£39 3s. 6d. paid now will buy a £5O share in five
years, or £l7 18s. lid. will buy one in 21 years—a
fine example of the sort of busy bee that compound
interest is. But this is not all. After putting by
enough to provide for the agreed-upon interest, the
directors consider whether they can’t give a bonus.
Last year £751 was made available for that pur-
pose out of the surplus, and that meant 4s. per
£5O share, payable at maturity—not a big bonus,
but satisfactory considering the security, which looks
sound. Reserves, certainly, are not prodigious; and
they have to protect a good deal of deposit money
as well as the share capital. This shows one or two

A total of £15,558 to cover the risks incidental
to £113,316 of advances doesn’t look great. Many
a slump has knocked more than 14 p.c. off the top
of property values. But, in the first place, it may
be fairly assumed that the society doesn't advance
anything like the full value of a property; and as
all or most of the advances are made on building-
society terms, the margin of safety is gradually
widened. For a steady lay-by, the society has a
lot to recommend it; and, anyway, it and its kind
do a great deal of good in showing what compound
interest can do for the little man as well as the big
one.

*This includes “premiums purchasing paid-up poli-
cies allocated from cash bonuses not drawn.”
(This includes “cash bonuses”—£l7,22l for
1911 and £19,512 for 1912.
In 1911 this society adopted a new practice, which
threw the table out of gear. Before that time it
(like others) didn’t include the annual bonus with
its expenditure on the one side, or the insurance
bought with the bonus additions on the other. The
new practice is, theoretically, right enough; but it
inflates the figures, and makes it useless to compare
some of this co.’s returns with those of other offices.
For instance, if the very rough and ready method is
adopted of dividing the premiums and other income
into the expenses to arrive at the expense rate, it is
obvious that the rate in this case will be curtailed,
because of the addition of the premium income de-
rived from bonuses uncollected in cash. To make a
comparison possible with other offices, this premium
income would have to be shown separately. And
there is really no reason why this office shouldn’t
adopt that practice, because its true expense rate is
not high. Take the rough and ready method first,
deducting, however, from the income the £18,796
received as premiums from cash bonuses:—
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

1907 . . 22 18 2 „
Probably that is a few pence over the mark, because
a few pounds may have been received as single pre-
miums apart from those derived from the cash
bonuses. But one wants to know, when consider-
ing an expense rate, what amount of new business
.was got; for whether a £2O rate is good or bad
depends upon the new business that had been roped
in, since to get a first premium costs anything up
to 20 times as much as to get the average renewal
premium. Following this paper’s practice of charg-
ing renewal premiums with a fixed 7 p.c. and
single-premium business with 3 p.c., it will be found
that the balance in this case is £24,459, which may
be taken as the cost of getting new business that
brought in £26,105 of premiums; so the new-
business expense rate was 93.6 p.c., whicn is dis-
tinctly moderate. Actually it was less, because in
a small office like this the cost of getting in re-
newal premiums is probably rather more than 7
p.c.; also, the investments cost something to look
after.
With the City Mutual the cost of looking after the
investments is no doubt higher per cent, than in
most offices, because it lays itself out to make ad-
vances in small as well as large amounts —in fact,
it seems to prefer the small amount and the security
which, though frequently quite good, takes some
looking into. The result is that last vear the earn-
ings of the funds averaged £5 9s. 6d.‘p.c. Further,
a profit of £5500 was made on the sale of invest-
ments. The insurance office, as a rule, doesn’t look
to make a profit on its investments. It wants safetv
above all things, and it aims at getting the best rate
of interest it can without risking its principal. A«
a matter of fact, even when it thinks it isn’t taking
a risk, it often takes something substantial in that
way, as the large amounts written off after the boom
20 years ago prove; and the banks that bought
Consols at or about par and now find them worth
£7O or so have perhaps modified their opinions
about gilt-edged securities. The City Mutual appar-
ently declines to be governed by any fixed rules. It
believes it has some brains, and it tries to use them
for the benefit of policy-holders. It is therefore to
some extent an investment co. as well as an insur-
ance office. “Debentures of public cos. figure in
the balance-sheet as an asset for £10,106; “stocks
and shares of public cos.” for £29,842. Mainly the
success of this kind of business depends upon the
keenness of the management. And though it has
succeeded so far, the management knows that acci-
dents may happen, wherefore the £5500 of profit
made on investments this year is wisely put to a
contingency fund, which now totals £15,500. But,
after all, the amount in the securities with a pos-
sible sting in their tail is small ; 17 p.c. of the
total assets are Government securities, 42 p.c. mort-
gages, 8 p.c. policy loans, and 13 p.c. freeholds.
The energy which the average insurance office de-
votes to getting big business figures thus goes in
this office in other directions. Besides chasing up
investments that give an extra 1 or 2 p.c., it sniffs
out its policy-risks with a good deal of care. For
some years past it has also gone to the length of
paying hospital fees in case of sickness. The policy-
holder who falls ill and fades away doesn't live to
pay a premium another day. Somehow or other it
certainly is a fact that the society's death rate is
exceptionally low, and that means bonuses. Insurance
bonuses flow in from three sources: (1) favorable
mortality experience, ('2') interest earnings in excess
of those assumed in the original calculations, (3)
low expense rate. From its excellent showing as to
(1) and (2) the City Mutual gives results far better
than would be expected by anyone who has got into
the bad habit of assuming that big business and
big bonuses mean the same thing.

The co. is now awake and putting in a bit more
energy: considerable main-extensions have been car-
ried out, and the slot business is being cultivated.
It was time. This indicates how the liquid re-
sources have been bitten into:—

Liquid assets .. £7608 £5074 £4515
Liabilities .. 897 2017 4406

The trouble is that, even with the outlay on exten-
sions, etc., gas sales don’t show up as well as they
did five years ago. As at Dec., 1907, they brought
in £5848 for the half-year; for the past six months
only £5658. This isn’t healthy-looking; and there
are still grave doubts whether enough revenue is
being spent on plant, etc., to cover general deprecia-
tion. On the co.’s own showing the 12 p.c. dividend
was for several years not fully earned ; and it is a
question now whether 10 p.c is not too much to pay
out. 1

Thus, the general prosperity of Queensland has its
effects on even the small gas co. ; and the directors,
knowing that the slump will make its presence felt
as well, keep the brake hard on dividends. So the
reserve, which at present isn’t very formidable, be-
gins to assume reasonable proportions. As to the
cash position there is no need for anxiety:—

Since December, 1907, the co., besides making re-
newals, repairs, etc., has added £378 to its surplus
of liquid assets. During the same period the gas
sales, etc., have grown from £1299 to £2106,
which suggests that the extensions have been pretty
considerable. And things should continue to creep
along for some time yet; for while there is no
special reason why Warwick should bound ahead,
nothing has so far appeared on the horizon to sug-
gest that it will drop astern more rapidly than the
rest of the country.

“Your directors, believing that the acquisition of the
Hydro-Electric Power and Metallurgical Oo.’s reticu-
lation scheme would be of benefit to this co., have
the pleasure to announce that they have concluded
negotiations for its purchase.” So the shareholders
can breathe again; and Hobart can console itself
with the thought that it is no better off than it was
before. Altogether Gillies’s fine scheme for harness-
ing up the waters of the Great Lake and supplying
light and power to the south of the island has come
a bad cropper—chiefly, it seems, because evervbody
opened his mouth too wide. This Hobart Gas Co.
was already in the electric-light business, but on
appearances, never tried to push it, and simnly held
the reins to scare anybody else off the coach. Prob-
ably it will do a bit more now. What the mirchase

but it certainly isn’t very much. Something appears
to have been already paid; anyway, the co.’s over-

Launceston is one of the few spots in the Sleepv i s l e
that are the least bit up-to-date; and, though it
aoesnt overdo the thing, it, at any rate, owns a muni-
?i lpa ? ecd:ric station (supplied with cheap power from
the River ; Esk) ; and being a municipal affair this
station isn t out after dividends. Hence its gas com-
petitor doesn’t browse in clover. Besides hav-
ing this to struggle with, the gas co. has a deben-
ture debt of £36,495, and that has to have its bite
before shareholders get a taste. The table shows the
poor taste they get, while their more fortunate neigh
bors at Hobart are having a square meal of between
8 and 9 p.c. Gas sales don’t leap ahead; thev
merely crawl—from £5915 for the six months ended
December, 1907, to £6304 as at the end of 1912

A few of the figures in the last line have been
guessed at. Invariably some of the bonus is not
collected within the prescribed time and reverts
to the co. ; for this half-year the amount has been
estimated at £420. Hitherto a bonus has also
been divided among employees; for the half-vear to
July 12, 1912, it amounted to £614. There is no
mention of such a bonus this half-year—probablv
on account of increases in regular pay. This at
any rate seems a fair assumption, judging bv the
jump in the expense rate:—

If the business had been run at the same cost last
half-year as it was three vears ago, the expenses
would have been £42,375 instead of £47,847—a
difference of £5472. Profits have not moved up
correspondingly, with the result that the bonus on
cash purchases, which was put up to 2s. 3d. in the £
in 1907, has been lowered for the past six months
to 2s. in the £. In addition shareholders draw
10 p.c. p.a. on their capital: but if reserves are
included the division represents only about 2£ p.c.
The bonus on purchases is solid; but there is nothing
at all flash about the investment. As a matter of
fact, practically nobody buys these shares as an
investment: the great majority of them are held in
ones and twos to qualify the holder to pass his
plate up for the bonus on purchases. Paid capital
is only £13,884; but as the co.’s trade is nearly all
for cash, and as nothing is nailed down in freeholds,
the liabilities are comparatively small —£12,950 on
mortgage and £43,566 to trade creditors, the bank
and shareholders. The total debt is much larger than
it was until recently; but something like £25,000
has of late been put into the improvement and fitting-
up of premises held on long lease. This asset is
being steadily and it seems adequately written down
out of profits. The increased costs are significant.
As was remarked here when this co.’s accounts were
post-mortemed six months ago—“ Last year and the
year before showed extra good results, because the
trade got a spurt on ahead of wages, etc. ; but the
spurt that wages, etc., have now put on will probably
outlast the spurt in trade, and that won’t be good for
the look of profits.” This is going to be true of
plenty of other concerns besides the Svdney Civil
Service Stores.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Aaolt
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploving such appliances. W. and J. Lempnere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Heel a
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of. If
they say this of the mills, it should. be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

Trade has been brisk at Newcastle; but this old-
established co. is drowsy. Its mine manager, Alex-
ander Ross, retired a while ago after nearly half a
century’s service; and John Wheeler, who got out
of the secretary’s chair a month or two back, had
been helping to look after the financial side for 43
years. It is that sort of co.—highly respectable,
but not up-to-date in some of its methods. Profits
suffer in consequence. Look at the change in things
in 10 years: —
Dec., 1902. Dec., 1912.
Liabilities £1,473 £6.902
Mining and fixed property . . 83,901 93,467
Liquid assets 91,417 75,561
That shrinkage in liquid assets is significant; it
suggests pretty strongly that the dividends have not
been fully earned. Admittedly, a lot of the liquid
assets that have disappeared have gone into fixed
property; but, unfortunately, the expenditure
hasn't produced more profits; and it is more than
possible that there ought to be a still further large
expenditure to put the mine on an equality with its
competitors.
One can pretty well guess at the size of
Sydney’s land-subdivision and building boom from
the fact that the Intercolonial Investment, Land and
Building Co., which in 1910 had a capital of
£51,000, has since the beginning of that year paid
its shareholders £49,036 in bonuses and added
£21,500 to its own reserves.
Batchelor and Tait, Ltd., who run a cold-
storage business in Sydney, lately issued their first
balance-sheet. Shareholders are not entitled to be
very jubilant about it. Starting with a deficit of
£6333 (goodwill, £6215), a trading loss of £l7l
has now to be added to that amount. Further, as
the auditors point out, “no depreciation has been
written off any of the assets of the co.” The paid
capital is £18,768; the liabilities, including £BllB
of a mortgage debenture debt, amount to £14,564.
To represent this money the co. has £ll,OOO in free-
hold and buildings, £14,491 in plant, and a few
pounds in sundries. The managing director says that
“we have more than carried out our estimate of busi-
ness forecasted at the commencement of the co.’
It is early yet, no doubt, to speak, but it is to be
hoped that the estimates of profits will also be “car-
ried out” in the future. Business alone isn’t much good
to the shareholders. Meantime the big burden of
debt (including a generally-dangerous mortgage-
debenture debt) must be viewed with a considerable
amount of anxiety.

Some years ago the Broken Hill Prop.
considered the question of manufacturing white lead ,
but nothing was done, and though Australia is one
of the world’s biggest lead producers, it has con-
tinued to import practically all its painters goods
from foreign parts. There seems a prospect of this
ridiculous anomaly being ended. A process (Banes s)
has been locally evolved for producing white lead
of so good a quality that painters have spoken with
enthusiasm about it. The product is very similar to
American sublimed white lead ; that is ® ay> JJ*
chief constituents are lead sulphate and lead oxide,
with a small quantity of lead sulphite and zinc
oxide —the last-mentioned constituent (which is no
drawback) being due to the fact th f* .®, rok ™ ?'
concentrates are used as the raw material Elabor
ate tests have been made of the pigment, and
covering qualities and resistance to sea-air are pro-
nounced first-class. The process is patented widely
and a co. is being formed in Sydney to S° lnt °
business. Every doubt as to the quality of the goods
having been set at rest, the future hangs now mainly
upon the cost of production ; and on the figures sub
Sed, that seems all right. The process of manu-
facture consists of feeding the ore (mill concern
trates) into a furnace through a blow-pipe flame, fed
with producer-gas and air under pressure. The par-
ticles pass into a hot oxidising atmosphere, charged
with sulphur from the ore, and the mineral is con-
verted thus into fumes, which are collected in cham-
bers The residues (gangue) fall into a coke bed in
the furnace. A S t he sulphur in the concentrates
fwhich are, of course, derived from sulphide ores)
w"ll supply most of the fuel, it ought to be a cheap
process • and the well-tested product proves that it
is effective. The experimental P la nt, as mentione

Shares in the Great Cobar have had a
bad slump, and are now down to 58s. (£5 paid).
Nothing new has apparently occurred at the mine.
The primary trouble is the very heavy debenture and
other debt; the secondary trouble lies in high costs
and comparatively poor recoveries, which combine to
make it almost impossible for the properties to pay
anything to the shareholders after wear and tear
has been provided for and the debenture holders
attended to. There is a rumor that General-manager
Bellinger, who is out of the country, on leave, will
not return; but if there is anything in that yarn,
he has changed his mind since he left. Most likely
there is nothing in it.
Lloyd’s Copper, Burraga (N.S.W.), is
already up against its old trouble, viz., scarcity of
firewood. The recent rains have affected the new
tram line, so the mine and mill stopped from Friday
till Monday. Labor is somewhat scarce, and stop-
pages like this will not improve the supply, more
especially as winter is approaching and no reserve
stock of fuel is visible.
Some of the boom reports from the Ardle-
than tin field (N.S.W.) will make sad reading for
someone. For instance, one appeared in the Herald
giving the value of some 25 p.c. ore as “ £56 per
ton.” That’s £2 4s. Bd. per unit, or more than
ingot metal is worth landed in London.
* * * ■*
Captain Richard, late of Mount Morgan,
more or less settled down nowadays in Brisbane as
consulting engineer, has been having a hurried look
at Ardlethan. He says what nearly every other well-
informed mining man has said of the field—rich,
though small, surface bodies; permanency as yet un-
proved. As prospecting ventures he thinks, however,
that they are excellent, and he has big hopes that
some of them will make good.
* * * *
Significant remark from the report of
the visit of N.S.W. Minister for Mines Edden to
Ardlethan: “Mr. Pittman, Under Sec., visited the
field about five months ago, and since then only
about 10ft. of sinking has been done.” The specu-
lators who hold most of the ground know they have
something on and near the surface. It looks as
though they are not keen on probing the properties
to see whether there is anything of much value down
lower.

As was expected after Leverrier, K.C., had
torn the B. H. Junction North’s witnesses to pieces,
the big Equity suit between that co. and its neighbor,
the Junction, has ended wholly in the Junction’s
favor, so far as Justice Rich can end it.
It was all about ventilation. The law says
that two neighboring mines may be required
to connect underground workings, and keep
the connection open for purposes of ventilation.
A connection was made between these two mines,
and the Junction North then, it is alleged, used fans
and turned the Junction shaft into an upcast: in
other words, it gave the Junction its bad air, if it
had any, and it seems to have a good deal. The
Junction put up doors to stop the current. The
Junction North people kicked at that, and brought
this action; and the Judge decided against them
with costs, and costs may be anything up to £4OOO.
There is pretty certain to be an appeal; but the
Judge seems to have had no doubts in his mind,
whatever anybody else may have.

An important deal was concluded last week
when the Zinc Corporation took over the old Sunny
Corner mine (N.S.W.) from the people who got
command of it about a year ago. The new owners
will, it is understood, form a subsidiary co. to
work the once well-known property ; the capital will
probably be £225.000. It is 13 or 14 years since
the mine was worked; but that isn’t because it
wasn’t worth while. A verv exhaustive examination
has been made, and if the Zinc Corporation had not
exercised its option there were others ready to grab
it. The Sulphide Corporation, which was looking
on with much interest, has got the next best thing
available, having acquired a working option on the
Nevada, a smaller property in the same neighbor-
hood. _ »

The over-loaded Eleanora. Hillgrove
(N S.W.), has sunk its main shaft 106 ft. below No.
8 level The next level will be at 800 ft. No. 8 has
been poor so far, but the reef shows some improve-
ment to the north-west. The most encouraging de-
velopment has been in No. 1 winze from the east
parallel drive. At 65ft. from No. 7 level, assays
give 30dwt. over a width of 6ft. Franklin White
thinks it the best thing he has seen in the mine.
No 8 level to the north-west will have to go 180tt.

Mount Elliott stock had a cataclysinal
fall from £6 17b. to £5 12s. 6d in. 24 hours and
of course, after the inner ring had got out, the
ordinary shareholder is told that Corbould is shutting
the mines and smelters down for three or four
months. One tale is that the Hampden Consols fire
is serious ; another that the Elliott itself must make
a “creep” safe. The subsidence at the 300 ft. level
or thereabouts last vear, was big enough to be called
a “creep” by Charters Towers miners, but Broken
Hill men would laugh at it. There are other tales
of poor ore at the lowest level, and these may be
truer than this alleged necessity to close down the
mine in order to make it safe. There are nearlv
148 000 of the 150.000 shares issued and this fall
means a lower market value of £375.000 on the
figures of a month ago. France was feeding heavily
on this stock a while back, and its table manners
were quite gentlemanly, the shares being tipped for
£2O on the more or less sanguine reading of the
general manager’s announcement that the mine could
pav present divs. for three or four years. The
Frenchman will nrobablv declare war on the sellers
from whom he bought and the wild tmsters; some
of him will certainlv be madder than when the great
Republic lost Strasburg. Of course, it doesn t h irt
a producing mine to shut it down for four months.
Nevertheless, the Board’s statement that the finan-
cial position of the co. is so strong that its interests
will be practically unaffected. is so much guff.

A circular which tells a tale of struggle:
“The directors of the Great Fitzroy Mines, Ltd.,
have decided that the existing option to share-
holders over the unissued shares shall be extended
until May 31, 1914.” Alas, there are so many once-
optimistic shareholders who have regretfully come
to the conclusion that their affection for big low-
grade copper deposits was misplaced.

Mount Morgan produced 137,1690 z. of
gold (fine) last year, which makes it the most im-
portant producer of the yellow metal in Queensland.
Charters Towers makes a good second with 98.3720 z.
( £417,857). For the past six months Mount Mor-
gan has treated 145,643 tons ore for a return of
4441 tons copper and 60,5020 z. gold. The best re-
turn was in November (at the close of the half-year:
855 tons copper and 13,0790 z. gold. The lowest
return was in the following month, which gave 590
tons copper and 77480 z. gold. For the half-year
ended November 31, 1912, Mount Morgan produced
5004 tons of copper. The base metal was sold for
forward delivery, at boom prices, and every effort
was made to force production. The copper produced
in December, January and February was 1923 tons,
containing 27,0440 z. gold ; rverage, 14.060 z. of fine
gold per ton of copper, so the latter at £6O per
ton is a shade more valuable than the gold. There
are very few mines which produce nearly equal
values of gold and copper like that.

Papuan Brilliant and Victoria, Charters
Towers, is crushing another lot of stone from the
Moonstone. Shareholders keep their pecker up on
the strength of the last aggregate return of £6013
from 546 tons and dividends amounting to £2400.
From the same shoot the New Queen Cross, which
is a close neighbor, crushed 425 tons for £4754.
So far, this hanging-wall reef, off the Moonstone, has
given an average of £ll 17s. per ton from 971
tons. Encouraged by these results, the S.E. Day
Dawn is driving on a formation within its Persever-
ance lease towards the Cross. This drive is at a
vertical depth of 120 ft., and has some 600 ft. to go
to reach the boundary. The New Queen Cross shaft
is to be deepened when the new haulage shaft —which
follows the underlay of the reef —is completed.
Trucks will be run up the shaft to the surface.
Prospects appear sound enough, but it must be re-
membered that these Moonstone workings are all
very shallow and the reef irregular. The revival on
the Moonstone is due to the discovery of a com-
paratively rich reef branching off into the hanging-
wall, and its continuation in length and depth is
highly speculative.

The Crooked Creek mine, on the Chilla-
goe field, owned by E. B. Torpy, has a small lead
mill; and plans have been prepared for a zinc
plant to handle the tailings. A flotation process is,
of course, contemplated.
“Brightite”: The condemnation of gold-
dredging, especially as regards the Bright (Vic.) dis-
trict, goes too far, as a rule. I ioin with those
who object to the destruction of good land along the
Ovens flats at Porepunkah, Eurobin and Mvrtleford;
but the damage done at the two first-named places
is almost entirely due to one co., which has proved
a sad failure. This is accounted for by the high price
of land acquired and excessive managerial and other
costs. On a capital of £66.500 the co. has paid
shareholders back in dividends onlv £37,469. and
the end is in sight now. From Porepunkah upwards,
along both the Ovens and Buckland valleys, very
little harm has been done; in fact, for many miles
rather the reverse is the case, as thousands of old
shafts have been filled and the country made fairly
level. From the last available report of the Mines
Department, the following returns show the amount
of gold won, capital invested and dividends paid since
the industry was established. Several small concerns,
which are “sick,” or have passed out, are omitted,
but the figures quoted will serve to show the im-
portance of the industry to the people of the dis-
trict: — .

it seems ridiculous to value the stuff at £l2O per
ton on the assumption that so many milligrams of
pure radium bromide will be produced and sold at
what may be regarded as famine prices. The purity
of the radium product and the price received for it
have to be firmly established before the value of con-
centrates can be estimated.
From Manila (Philippine Islands) : r lhe
Paracale River Dredging Co. was formed in Mel-
bourne to mine three parcels of land, one held by
the Philippine Gold Dredging Co., the other the
Mellville claim, and the third the Nueva California
group of claims. The title to the Mellville claim is
now disputed. The locators of the ground hold the
land under the mining laws in force in the 1 hilip-
pine Islands, and it is this title which has been
passed on to the Melbourne co. But the original occu-
pants of the lard claim to have old titles from the
Spanish Government. According to decisions ot the
Philippine courts, confirmed by the Supreme Court
of the United States, such titles are perfectly sound.
As the people who claim the old titles cannot come
to terms with the people who transferred the land to
the Melbourne co., the Paracale River Co. will be
under a cloud until the question of titles is settled.
Further, in the Paracale River District many more
disputes are pending as to titles, and much valuable
property will be tied up indefinitely, so it is a good
district to leave alone.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, March 17, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
Governor Strickland stepped ashore at
Farm Cove on one of Sydney’s most dazzling
days—a morning all blue and gold, whipped
by a few cool catspaws that just lifted the
stacks of bunting, then dropped them on to
their moorings with a flirty shake. The offi-
cial landing, as a dressy side-show, was
much better stage-managed than is usual
at these episodes in the lives of Governors.
The Encounter banged its guns as the
Governor’s steam wherry cut across the sap-
phire waters of Farm Cove. The police
band blared forth a cheerful supply of mixed
music till the new Excellency got his feet
on the creaking pontoon, when “God Save”
smote the listening earth.
Acting-Town Clerk Layton, draped in a
long black toga, with a trencher-board
perched on his benign brow, dashed forward
with an official tome under one arm, and,
presumably, took the new arrival’s name
and address before he had time to defend
himself. Mayor Cocks, who carries the
ermine of office with the air of a duke in a
congenial billet, stood bare-headed to disclose
the identity of a long string of aldermen.
Fremier Jim IVlcGowen, very carefully
groomed, extended the glad hand, and his
friends in office also circled round the brand-
new Strickland with friendly intent. Mini-
ter Trefl6 stuck to bowler hat, but two or
three of the others, including Premier Jim,
beamed under the brim of shiny things in
silk.
• , Edeline » by the way, is not so well
in health as her friends would wish her to
be, so she stuck to the Osterley right through
riom the TV est. This knocked one possible
complication as to precedence off Melbourne
Government House’s list of worries last
week.
Governor Strickland’s first public utter-
ance in N.S.W. shows that he is a person of
tact He mentioned our “unrivalled har-
bor, and followed his appreciation of life
under the Southern Cross with the post-
script that his youngest-born is a little Aus-
tralian.
toddling down the stone steps
to the official landing-place, in their scarlet
petticoats, made coy snatches at their red
robes, as the breeze blew the garments away
from their ankles. Horsehair curls dangled
round the face of Justice, as the wearers
tripped under the little awning, like relics of
mediaeval splendor when barons bold gnawed
the breast of a chicken under the watchful
eye of red-robed retainers.
At the swearing-in the Gentleman Helps
were the glory of the autumn morn, which
sent shafts of golden sunshine on their heavy
buHion trappings. Captain Forbes, of a
Highland regiment, was clad in plaid trou-
sers, fairly tight, and of a pattern that was
large enough to encase each leg before it fin-
ished one Highland square of tartan. His
manly chest was firmly buttressed inside a
scarlet jacket, hung with gold cables thick
enough to tether a mailboat to a wharf stan-
chion. A red top-knot fluttered on his In-
dian helmet. He walks from the waist, after
the manner of an infantry regiment, which
being a good deal on its legs, is trained to
style in moving its feet.
The slender and rather delicate-looking
Private Sec., Victor Hood, who was so popu-
lar during his previous Victorian sprint in
that capacity, wore his head in a sombre
black-cocked hat at the swearing-in episode.
Very neat, cutaway coat-tails and raven in-
expressibles completed his lingerie.
Mrs. Forbes, wife of one of the new Gov-
ernor s staff, Captain Ronald Forbes, created
a commotion on the Osterley by the exten-
sive size and variety of her wardrobe. Other
dressy ladies did their best to keep up with
the dashing lorbes dame, who is tall, hand-
some, and wears a fine color in her cheeks,
but their achievements, according to a passen-
ger who was an eye-witness of the sartorial
struggle, were not up to their hopes. The
Osterley s decks were, however, sw’ept each
evening by new and gorgeous specimens of
the latest train—a thin, curly streak of
diaphanous drapery that makes a note of
interrogation on the floor.
Sydney is so full for the great Easter
horn and hoof parade that the question of
hotels with elastic-sides is again before the
public mind. The architect who can invent
automatic beds that will climb up to the
roof (which should be flat) when you press
a button, and tavern walls that will extend
snven the Pressure of a few extra tons of
lugg&gc, will only have to claim a vast for-
tune to get the reward that is awaiting his
ingenuity. 6
For the first time since Federation, Sydney
is shorn of the money-scattering presence of
a Governor-General, and the shops are emit-
ting cries of distress at the dearth of large
orders for frills, hats, socks and frocks. The
sudden access of thrift on the part of the
Smart section of local Society is probably
due to two causes. Some of our better-off
dames have only recently returned from an
extended gallop through foreign countries
and heavy purses of Australian-made cash.
Others are packing up for a flutter in Lon-
don, Monte Carlo and similar places, which
supply every incentive to the suffering rich
* xca through their surplus coin at the rate
or xoU an hour. Hence a generally flat ob-
servance of the Easter dress parade, so far
as huge private displays of pelf are con-
cerned.
The and his lad y> to say nothing
the OMalley and Prime Minister Fisher,
nad the luck to escape the sudden and rare
outbreak of much water at Canberra. The
luckless Light Ilorse were probably about
bait-dry for the opening blast of the chris-
tening band-music, having been almost
washed out of their camp a few days before
the Federal baby blinked in the presence
of sub-royalty.
Australia had a lucky escape from the
h amily Herald name Myola, which was
threatened. The native inhabitants of the
bush hamlet gave a whoop of joy when
they heard the familiar Can-berra escape
from Lady Denman’s keeping; they
hadn’t taken to a Federal city too
kindly at best, and “Myola” would have
been the last straw. Queanbeyan is the
centre of a conservative “oldest family”
sheep-patch, where the original pure merinos
bleated in rich folds which they believed
were theirs in perpetuity. Of one dead-and-
gone autocrat, who once ruled at Duntroon,
old settlers used to relate that he occasion-
ally objected, with a stockwhip, to mere
yokels wearing hob-nailed boots. If they
walked across young sheep-fodder in the
Duntroon pastures, they had to mind their
ways. The intrusion of artisans, builders
and Labor politicians into these once exclu-
sive. mutton-lord’s paddocks has made the
foolish Federal infant mighty unpopular in
its own teething ground.
The death of Mr. 11. Marcus Clark, at
Mount Wilson, where he was full of the joy
of his new possessions up that way, is one
of the unexpected strokes of the Man with
the Scythe. Ten or 12 days ago I saw him
motoring along the hilly steeps between
Mount Wilson and the little railway station
at Bell. A tall, rather slim man, looking
much younger than his years, which were in
the early ’so’s, Mr. Clark seemed good for
another half century of life. Founder and lead-
ing member of the well-known firm of
Marcus Clark, Ltd., he recently made his
country home on Mount Wilson, one of the
beauty spots of N.S.W., as I told you last
week. As he was genial and open-handed,
the inhabitants up that way expected a re-
vival of the old-time bustle. He re-named
the home he occupied, and practically re-
built Sefton Hall. Rumor said that he also
contemplated giving each of his three sons
a property up in those fern-draped heights.
Prof. Warren, of Sydney Uni., just back
in the Osterle.v, was taken for exercise on
the decks of that craft by a stupendous bull-
dog. Whether this is the priceless canine
which habitually leads the professor about in
his N.S.W. holiday jaunts I don’t know.
Glasgow gave the wanderer an LL.D., and
he spent part of his absence from Sydney
peering into Egypt’s water supply.
The veteran artist Piguenit has just
passed his 76th milestone. He won the first
helping of the Wynne art prize over 20
years ago. Piguenit has a clever way of
handling indigo blue and faint shades of
mountain mist. The National Gallery owns
one of his finest samples of putting illusive
distance on mere canvas —a big oil-painting
of Kosciusko.
G. R. Taylor, the six-foot father of Syd-
ney lawyer Dolf Taylor, a mere dwarf of
6ft. sin., took a holiday from his job of
reigning over Dubbo last week, and he and
his son cast lengthy shadows in Castlereagh-
street. The Dubbo man is over the 70-year
mark, and was born in Elizabeth-street, Syd-
ney. His father, George Taylor—also a long
man if not as thick a one—was a pedagogue
in Fort-street, and opened St. Philip’s Gram-
mar School in 1848, or thereabouts. The
Dubbo king prizes the big silken banner
which flaunted over the St. Philip’s school
foundation stone-laying by Bishop Brough-
ton. He has lived in his western kingdom
for 50 years or so, and has for 40 years been
president of Dubbo hospital—a position he
hangs on to with great tenacity, resenting
hotly any attempt to put him out of work.
The French-Canadian singer. Eva Gauthier,
who blew into this city from the “near East”
the other week, made a sensational success
in her recent concerts in the Concordia Hall.
With Laurence Godfrey Smith as pianist,
and Eva warbling in full-throated mezzo-
soprano lays, these first music-bursts of the
concert season belong to the infrequent, all-
star class. Harold Whittle’s reliable fingers
were on the piano as accompanist to the
Voice.
The new German hall, the Concordia, is
probably better in its acoustics than any
other concert patch in town. In this it beats
the vast Albert Hall (London), which until
lately supplied an echo that used to rap back
maddeningly to voice and instrument. Re-
cently the authorities have circumvented
this fiend, by tying it up in overhead wires.
In its decorations the Concordia stage is a
welcome relief to the dull dais which British
taste associates with Art. A little on the
gaudy side, perhaps; still, its Noah’s Ark
door, cut out like a doll’s-house exit, goes
well enough with the gilded proscenium
Behind this door flitted the German waiter.
As he is German, and wears a short, white'
coat (with other garments), I suppose he is
a waiter. On Thursday night he mostly
waited on the English language, which he
didn’t understand. Two candles flickered in
the artist’s pantry or small loose-box. Laur-
ence Godfrey drew the attention of the Teu-
ton to the eclipse of the electric light in this
retreat dedicated to the powder-puff and
hair-brush, and Mi«« Gauthier addressed
him in rousing Dutch. But the light failed
just the same.
In consequence, perhaps, ef her hurried
descent into the Dutch language, and in part,
also, because she was nervous, the Voice met
a frog in its throat and didn’t attack the first
extract from “II Barbiere” in its opening
bars with the perfect precision of the singer’s
otherwise faultless style from that moment
till the end of the evening. Dramatic, and
obviously born to welter in heavy operatic
roles, Eva Gauthier is the finest artist, in her
way, Sydney has heard since another French-
Canadian, Paul Dufault, roused this town to
a tumult of applause. The Gauthier vocal
organ is very young, with the round, rich
notes of some feathered warbler singing its
matin song to the early worm. Unpuffed
before her arrival, and practically unknown
to Australians, the charming young woman
lifted a high C at her first concert in so cap-
able a manner that it caught the musical ear
of Henry Bracy, who knows the vocal art
from A to Z and home again.
I ianist Uaurence Godfrey Smith, after
having kept the pledge to abstain from teach-
ing for 21 months, has returned to Sydney
even better than his former best.
Mr. Norman Pilcher, whose parental name
bears the fearsome preface De Vere. was
married the other day to Miss Edith Minter.
t he bride is the. only daughter of the A. B.
Minters. Papa is the senior partner in the
big legal firm of Minter, Simpson and Co.
Dr. Guy D. Menzies was farewelled with
tne uproar of an evening concert in Drum-
moyne Town Hall before stepping aboard the
Otranto for Yew-rope. He takes his wife and
olive-branches with him. I fancy he pro-
nounces his name Mengies, and belongs to
tne_ clan that recently chose a Mrs. Menzies
as its lawful chieftain in the land of scones.

Under the high roof-tree of the Kodai-
Ivanal Observatory Mary Proctor noticed
many things, including spiders, during her
stay with Mrs. Evershed. In the middle of
an interview with the telescope, a huge
spider descended from his residential wlb
and made a careful trek for the star-lady’s
shoe-leather. “I jumped aside,” savs she
and forgetting that the Hindu won’t kill
these creatures, expected the attendant to
aid- Instea d, he smiled as the
weird thing took the centre of the floorway!
and said softly, ‘These things are most
precious . So they are on that mountain

mer can stretch under the glass of his tele-

Director Evershed was once driven to use
a hair from his wife’s locks. She is quite
a beauty in a gentle Madonna style, and
gladly gave her fine silky strand to help
science. But it couldn’t compete with the
gossamer thread from a web, and was only
a desperate remedy. So the spider seems
conscious of his importance at Kodai. and
stalks leisurely across the premises, unafraid.

“Tamumu”: Recent experiences in two of
them have convinced me that Maoriland
hospitals want shaking up. In the two in-
stitutions I refer to—one in a large ci v
the other in a small country town—con
sumptive patients were treated in the samp
ward with medical cases of a different
nature. It is true that the sufferers from
phthisis slept on the verandah when space
there was available; when it wasn’t thev
camped in the ward with the other inmates
In both hospitals I saw tubercular patients
expectorating over the verandah, although
they were provided with sputum mugs. In
certain Cold Country sanatoria the ’ con-
sumptive who expectorates anywhere except
into vessels provided for that purpose is
severely spoken to, and a second default
means summary discharge. It should be so
here also. Another matter that absolutely
shrieks for attention is that table utensils
(knives, spoons, mugs, etc.) used bv
the victims of phthisis are washed
up with the other ward dishes. In
the big city hospital the washing-up
was done by convalescents. Often the
water was only lukewarm—of a tempera-
ture quite inadequate to destroy the tubercle
bacillus. The tucker weapons of the con-
sumptives were differentiated from those oi
the other patients by a red thread attached
to them, but no attempt was made to cleanse
them separately! Altogether, if these hos-
pitals are typical, then the unfortunate
Maorilander who is undergoing treatment
in one of them for some other ailment, and
who is predisposed to phthisis, is in exactly
the right place to contract the disease
which, in such cases, he is usually in most
dread of.
“G.V.W.”: The strike of the Maoriland
slaughtermen ended as usual. Receiving
2os. per hundred, they struck for 30s. The
cos. offered 275. 6d., and called for men at
that figure. _ They also guaranteed that
learners, until proficient, would be paid not
less than 15s. per day. The response was
good. Just here, the “slim” leaders of the
men fell into. a blunder of the Waihi tyne.
On their advice a number of the old hands
went back as learners. Killing less than 50
sheep per day, they were paid 155., thus
getting more than the 30s. per 100 asked
for._ The leaders made a public boast of
their cleverness, whereupon the union opera-
tors were sorted out and promptly sacked.
Disgusted, the South Island men broke away
and w r ent back to work on the co.’s terms.
The others, having plenty of time on their
hands, are searching the dictionary for ap-
propriate terms for the leaders who advised
the foolishness. In between times they are
searching the Wanted column for signs of
something that will bring in bread, to say
nothing of beer.
From an Australian in England :
Llovd George’s Insurance Act, if it has done nothing
else, has unearthed two ghastly facts: first., the unbe-
lievable number of people in Merrie England who
have never in their lives been able to afford to see
a doctor; second, the callousness of charity-run,
doctor-owned hospitals. The day the Act got to
work, the doctors, at any rate in the poorer districts,
were over-run with the halt, maimed and wounded,
who paraded sores and excrescences that would have
done credit to a Barcelona mendicant. “When did
you last have this attended to ?” would shriek the
astounded medico. Mostly they never had had it
attended to, and never would have had but for the
legislation which is still a red rag to all “right-
think'ng” people. But while these poor wretches
were learning something for the first time concerning
antiseptic methods, the “charity” hospitals were re-
fusing to dress any patient who came under the
Act; no matter how long he had been attending,
he was turned from the door, and told to shift for
himself. An Act of this size can hardly come into
being without some sl'ght confusion, and poor, invalid
out-cases are not the ones to battle with it; conse-
quently a few wounds got septic, a few people died,
and the Right Thinkers shrieked again. Somehow
no one remembered to hang the doctors who were
responsible.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 17, 1913.
My Dear Tarrie, —
The Fuller lady supplied a domestic touch
to the frivolous group in the blue plush box
at Flemington on the day of the Champion
Stakes. The vice-regal youngsters had been
to tea with fair hair flying loose over blue
serge coats. When the tea procession arrived
back at the pen, her Ex. seized the manes of
her progeny and plaited them tightly, tying
them up with ribbons fished from some secret
maternal pocket. The deft nursery turn,
given in full view of the crowd, gave great
joy to the lawn walkers.
The polo outbreak finished in a wintry
rainstorm, and the Denman lady, peeping out
from Polar mufflings of fur, presented the
Tournament Cup trophies to the mud-spat-
tered but happy men of Camperdown. The
Fuller lady, Lady Barttelot and Mrs. Frank-
ly* 1 supplied applause that was filtered
through fur motoring gloves, and a neighbor-
ing group of large fur motor-coats contained
Mrs. Russell Grimwade, Mrs. Alister Clarke,
Mrs. Faulkner and Mrs. Boulivant. A choice
assortment of young Western District girls
helped to cheer the district teams.
Strickland, the new cocked hat of the Ma
State, showed up at the fray for a chilly
hour. I don’t think he polos, but he would
rather be on a horse than in a motor almost
any time ; and his girls are the same.
Mrs. Garnett, wife of one of the British
Commissioners at present asking questions
m Maoriland, and mother of Mrs. Geoff.
Syme, is living in a cyclone of suburban en-
tertainment. Mrs. de Bavay, of Kew, gathered
all the joyful neighbors to auction bridge last
week, and the Wrixon dame held a reception
m the new chum’s honor at the Riverside
house. During race week, Mrs. Agar Wynne
buttered the hospitable muffin at the Quamby.
For this function the visiting lady rustled
in clothes that thrilled all beholders.
The social world at present simply seethes
with farewell parties to intending travellers.
The functions are all of the tea-and-bun
order. The nobility and gentry of Toorak
whiz here and there “doing” two or three
farewells in an afternoon, and getting bun-
struck and tealogged in the process. On Fri-
day, Mrs. Dill invited her friends to drink a
parting cup with Mrs. Mcßae, who, with her
elder girleen, is hurrying off to England on
hubby’s arm. He intends to mix a little holi-
day with a certain amount of business.
Owing to the disappearance of the first-
class gangway fully a half-hour before the
Medina cast off, a crowd 3000 strong strug-
gled together upon the planks of the Port
Melbourne pier in a brave attempt to reach
the remote decks. A few said or shrieked
good-bye, and fled like rabbits from the mad-
ding crowd and the railway trucks. The
mourning Scott widow, hidden behind a sable
veil and a rampart of floral gifts, was an
object of interest to the less preoccupied of
the crowd. One large area of the deck was
sacred to Western District nobility, who lined
up clannishly to wave the last farewells.
There were Tom Millar’s handsome wife
(daughter of Toorak’s late sporting parson,
Fellows), the W. Cumming matron and her
sister, Mrs. McKellar. All three were laden
with presents and flowers. The younger
Baird sister waved a white-gloved hand at
the elder Miss Baird, who is to join her in
England in May.
Last Friday evening, the Quamby Club
spread itself in a musical au revoir to the
Fuller lady, who shortly departs with her
small family to England, where the young-
sters will get their educational drill. Her
Ex., attended by Help Curwen, was received
on the doormat by Mrs. Baldwin Spencer and
Mrs. Sherwood, and by them loaded with a
huge vegetable offering on behalf of the club.
The Rennie sisters, wearing their nicest
smiles, fluttered with mamma in the back-
ground. Her Ex., in silvery attire, with a
tiara skewered on her golden locks, was con-
ducted to the reception rooms, where jets of
osprey, shot up in every direction amongst
the lilies and roses. The music was good
Hugh Hardy (a nephew of Miss Hood) lifted
up a pretty tenor, and Maggie Sterling
polled the profoundly devotional “God Be
With You.” The accompaniment was sup-
plied by Hattenbach and Amadio.
Mrs. Power is taking her Reggie to Eng-
land, and their South Yarra home, father
Rupert s present to the young matron, is
now to let. Mrs. Reggie has been down in
the dumps since Mother departed, so she
and bubb - v and her pet dog are off to join
the Grey-Egerton party. There is just a
chance that our only home-grown baronet
may accompany his daughter part of the
way. He has returned from Papua, and
will presently join his lady at Cairo or Monte
Carlo or somewhere.
Mrs. Robert Chirnside recently held some
sort of gangway party to say au revoir to
her sister, Mrs. Clarke, who is one of the
fashionables booked for foreign travel.
The Vivian Highett chick is just now a
popular target for tender farewells. She goes
to join her parents in London.
A Lniversity Hostel for women is the next
deserving object that holds out the confident
bazaar paw for charity. Queen’s College has
presented the ground, and the hostel to be
built is intended to house 300 blue-stockings.
Irinity Hostel, the only place of the kind,
shelters a mere 20, and students attending
advanced ’Varsity lectures have to go out
into the highways and byways for board and
lodging. The Denman lady will open a fair
in aid of the proposed building on April 11,
when the Town Hall will be transformed
mto an old English town of the time of
Chaucer. She-brigands will dress to match
the scenery. Mrs. Peterson is drilling her
orchestral forces in ancient English music,
and the sweet, old-fashioned strains will help
the painless extraction of cash.
The Repertory Theatre Club did homage
to Oscar Asche and his Lily with an after-
noon party at the Austral Salon. Mrs.
Alfred Cornish, a charming amateur, was the
dove-grey hostess for the afternoon, and G.
H Kmbbs made a speech of welcome to the
Shakspeanan producer. Lesly Madden, with
smoothly-brushed hair and very shaggy bear
furs, came along with Mrs. Norman Army-
tage. Ex-President Wrixon’s lady, Mrs.
Knox and Mrs. Gurner herded with the
Severely Intellectual wing of the party. Vida
Goldstein, with a Votes-for-Women gleam in
her eye, looked brisk in short-haired furs.
Long-maned Shakspearian mummers flocked
round and sipped tea to the rippling of
music from a far corner. Lily Brayton, who
wore cherry-colored trirpmings and spread-
ing clothes with fur margins, was hemmed
in by women all the time.
Last week J. L. McMillan, of the Lands
Department, sealed his matrimonial bond
with old John Zevenboom’s grand-daughter
—the fair nightingale whom he lured from
the nursing staff at the Homoeopathic. The
newly-weds are now honeymooning at Gipps-
land Lakes. The officers of the Lands De-
partment, with secretary Macgibbon in the
chair, speechified the bridegroom-elect on the
eve of his translation, and presented him
with various costly eating anoliances.
Singer Rebottaro’s sister Aida, a pretty,
black-eyed _ girl with an Italian style of
coquetry, is engaged to Mr. John Gargure-
vich.
Louis D’Antoine, an indent merchant of
this city, is engaged to Norah Field, a hand-
f 0 ™® -Tasmanian she-squatter who does a
lot of Toorak visiting. The poor girl de-
veloped measles just about the time the
announcement was published, so she is
receiving all congratulations through a reek
of disinfectants.
Alice Jackson, daughter of the Collins-
street doctor, and Bobby Bruce got through
their wedding with the record quiet for a
Sassiety joining. The bride faced the altar
m a natty blue tailor-made, with her hair
tucked away under a smart little black trav-
elling hat, whilst two small nieces held any
extra paraphernalia such as gloves and
flowers. After the sedate ceremony Dr. Jack-
son motored a handful of friends back to
his loorak house, to clink a glass with the
newly-weds.
wMi e - slie the elder son of squatter
Wilham, of Mount Talbot, Balmoral, is
booked to marry in the near future pretty
Miss Flowers, of the same township.
Dot Noseda, of the Bert Bailey co., has
started a new collection of trinkets. The
last lot, valued at f 100, disappeared with
the family teapot when the burglars called.
Uie lady is now wearing the first of the new
senes. It is a sparkling engagement ring.
Ernest Cecil Adams, of Auckland, is the
lucky man.
The condemning of Mawson and six com-
rades to an unexpected and extra year’s
imprisonment in the South Polar ice seems
directly attributable to an extraordinary
event not on the programme. The Aurora
was lying anchored at Mawson’s base, and
in the expedition secretary’s words—•
The dogs seeing the ice cliffs in close proximity
howled piteously to go ashore. Penguins and seals
were discerned on the rocks. Later a strong gale
blew and the windlass being negligently left open
the heaviest cable glided into the water, and not
having been made fast, left us dependent on a much
lighter cable. This was a serious loss, as events
subsequently proved.
The loss of this anchor caused the others
to go. The Aurora had arrived to find
Mawson and two others unaccountably ab-
sent. Not daring to delay dashing to the
rescue_ of Wild’s party, 1600 miles away,
the skipper left the main base a day before
Mawson staggered in with the news that
Ninnis and Mertz were dead. A wireless
recalled the Aurora, but a gale of wind was
howling when she returned, and without
anchors the skipper could do nothing but
leave the leader and six volunteers to
another year’s gaol in the frozen South.
By strenuous work, Wild’s party was reached
in time. Mawson didn’t allow for such an
extraordinary event as the “negligent” loss
of the Aurora’s anchors —a happening which
would have been quite inexcusable on even
a lumber schooner in the bay.
Cisneros and her Count have been figur-
ing hugely in American papers—but not
in concert notices. The pair were asked to re-
tire from the Plaza Hotel Cafd, and finally did
it to the accompaniment of much wrathful lan-
guage. It appeared that the large lady
dressed in a riding habit, strolled into the
Cato for a cup of tea. She was told, with
all the subservience of a doubled-up waiter,
that they did not serve people in riding
dress. The lady expostulated; then her
husband came along, and expostulated some
more. But the uproar was in vain. The
rules of the Caf£ could not be broken. Still
the Cisneros couple refused to retreat
until the argument had degenerated into a
plain, unlovely row.
On Saturday, the disgracefully rich George
Fairbairns dealt themselves a bridge party,
by way of welcoming son Clive and his bride,
just back from a Tasmanian honeymoon.
The function also served as a farewell to
daughter Mrs. Stewart Balmain, who is
gathering up her young family and steam-
ing off to India in the wake of her military
husband.
The Mount Schank Clarkes, who have now
adopted Melbourne as a place of abode,
finished up the race-week frivols with a
smart, exclusive dance, which was a riot of
extravagant chiffons. Mamma, big and
handsome in white brocade, made a foil for
the two slender girls, who pumphandled
guests on either side of her. Roma had
cloth of silver panniers on her cream satin
clothes, while Vanda, dark as a gipsy, had
a startling corsage of flesh pink gauze in a
black satin dress. Little sister Nesta was
allowed in to the party, and floated about
in pink roses and blue chiffon. Aide Cur-
wen and Secretary Wilberforce escorted the
Barttelot lady to the frivol. Rupert Car-
rington brought himself, and Mrs. George
Chirnside brought the very latest thing in
coiffures.
Cattle King Kidman’s daughter, after the
brief taste of wedded joys usually allowed
to. a sailor’s bride, is wandering about
this city in a lonely and rather clothes-
destitute condition. Her tons of trousseau
are all at sea. They were sent afloat
by her lieutenant-husband, wbo, when sum-
moned back to duty on the destroyer War-
rego, wanted to save his bride all the luggage
bother, she being under contract to follow
on immediately. However, the mind that
directs the doings of cruisers is about as
variable .as the moon —not to mention
woman in the matter. The little Warrego
was duly ordered to Hobart for a stay; but
the word was soon given to heave up and
away. Which accounts for Mrs. Nelson
Clover trying to dress on the contents of a
suit case or so.
The Rubber Edwards pair recently set out
to motor to Sydney, but, taking a round-
about route which included Canberra, their
car had a breakdown, and they completed
their journey by train. Mrs. Edwards was
then on the sick-list, and had ever so many
medicine bottles, which she shelved while she
tried some early-morning surfing. After a
little of this treatment, she took those bottles
one by one and threw them two miles out
to sea.
Margaret Cooper has been sending long,
copy-plate screeds to friends she made in
Australia. The latest are full of South
African tour gossip. She murmurs rather
pettishly that South Africans are not vet
educated up to the art of songs at the
piano, so the veldt journey must be a trying
one.
Norman Bayles has tripped over to the
Speck to help nurse his sick wife. She was
at Mount Wellington, sampling its special
brand of icy air. when she ran on the rock of
ill-health, and has been stranded there for
many days.
The Rupert Clarke lady writes enthusi-
astically to some Melbourne friends of her
frocks and doings. The frocks are the usual
“dreams”; the lady who wears them is at
Monte Carlo, after “doing” the Continent
in company with a most distinguished
woman, whose illustrious name I have mis-
laid. . At “Monte” she. awaits her Rupert,
who is busy in Australia at the moment.
“Char” Crespin, the local, curly-haired
young warrior who is attached as A.D.C.
to State Governor Fuller, finds some of his
Gentleman Help duties most embarrassing.
On the last day of the Flemington races,
two fair-haired Fuller children clung lovingly
to his hands during the lawn parade. The
Captain, who is a young man of the aggres-
sively bachelor type,. blushed a fine scarlet
and stalked along like a petrified martyr
with his two clinging charges. A married
Help would have done that nursery duty
easily.
Hal Lewis, whose External Affairs experi-
ence here helped him to the billet, is now
the London agent, or something, for the
Chinese Government.
The Austral Salon, awakened from its
summer doze, started proceedings in a busi-
nesslike manner with a grocery tea, pro-
ceeds of which will be used to sustain the
Salonettes during the coming season. A
few musical items were perpetrated. The
collection will be broached at the forth-
coming welcome to members Thompson,
Boyd and Straub, who have been fluttering
over the Old and New Worlds.
The new Golf Links at Gisborne, which
are to rival the Macedonian caddie-walk on
the other side of the Mount, are to be de-
clared open by Lady Denman on April 5.
All golf links are distinctly open, but the
openness of these is to be affirmed as afore-
said. By the way, has any personage ever
opened the sea?
Australia isn’t the only place where a
Socialistic Government interferes with the
liberty of the subject and kicks Private En-
terprise in 14 places. In Paris they are
actually talking about putting a legal limit
on woman’s dress allowance. The horrid
idea has not even the merit of being new:
it dates back to the dim, man-tyrannicai
ages when real chivalry was a lot deader
than it is now.

“For the first six months of my daughter’s life
she was continually attacked with croup, and was

POLITICAL
POINTS
Australian sawmill hands are up against
trouble. They are paid from £2 9s. to £3
per weekj in Norway the same labor
£ets £l, and there are many female workers
in the business who get still less. Further,
freight from Norway is very cheap. Hence
timber for all sorts of packing cases is being
landed in Australia cut to sizes and all
ready to knock together. Meat cases by the
hundred thousand are being imported, and a
Norwegian rabbit crate is being sold at 7fd.,
whereas the Australian rock-bottom is 10id.
The old yarn was that distance from the
populous, low-wage countries offered Aus-
tralia sufficient Protection where bulky goods
are concerned; but the serious fact is that
cases cut to sizes can be landed here from
Norway for 2s. 4d. per 100 ft., while the
freight from Maoriland, where most of the
timber used in Australia comes from, costs
2s. 9d. Tudor, of the Customs, was appealed
to some time ago ; but before he had time to
move, the meat and other packers howled
like 10,000 dingoes, and nothing was done.
Somehow the poor Australian Protectionist
has got into the habit of dropping his creed
overboard as soon as a manufacturer yells
against his raw material being taxed. The
meat-packer and the fruit-merchant conveni-
ently overlook the fact that their goods are
somebody else’s raw material; in fact, every-
thing that everybody produces is somebody
THE NEW NIGHTMARE.
Mr. N. J. Sievers, a young Australian, until re-
cently of New College, Oxford, delivered a striking
address on “Syndicalism.” at the Trades Hall, on
Friday, under the auspices of the Political Labor
League.— Daily paper.
THE LITTLE BEAR : “Fancy the tiger coming
in those togs!”
else’s raw material or tool of trade, and
nobody would ever get any Protection at all
if there was anything in the argument which
was used to flatten out the Australian
sawyers.
“Dumper,” in disgust:—
Instead of fooling about with a six-hour day, the
Labor party would please a lot of its supporters better
if it provided eight hours of employment for them per
medium of the Tariff. Take the moving picture
business. The importation of films other than
scenic and educational is absolutely unnecessary.
They can all lie produced here at practically the same
cost to the picture showmen, and their production
would earn bread-money for hundreds of Australians.
But the big film exchange proprietors are almost
as patriotic as theatrical promoters—that is, they
will not give local goods a trial until they are forced
to. For instance, a local crowd recently produced
a splendid picture of the whaling industry at Jervis
Bay. The big city showmen unanimously gave it
the cold shoulder. Not to be discouraged, the local
crowd sent the negative to London. There it has had
a warm welcome, and the English people are
anxiously inquiring for more of the same sort. If
all the dramas, etc., which are now imported were
produced here, which is not a very large order,
think of the celluloid film that would be required.
With a decent dutv the manufacturing of this film
would be a gpod leg-in for big works. And so the
ball would roil on. But this would mean work, in:
stead of copying invoices, etc. ; so what’s the good ?
Uncle Sam is finding out that population
is not everything—that the thing to be
desired is population of the right kind.
Hence the Barnett Bill, which when the last
mail left had passed Congress and awaited
the President’s signature. This measure re-
quires that every immigrant must be able to
read and write his own language. Taking
the immigration of 1911, it would have
blocked three-fourths of the 158,000 from
Russia, half the 182,000 from Italy, one-
third of the 159,000 from Austro-Hungary,
and one-half of the 70,000 from elsewhere in
Southern Europe. And while it is getting
this crowd of low-grade illiterates from
foreign countries, the U.S.A. is losing
100,000 first-rate people to Canada every
year—the cream pushed out to make room
for ignorant Dagoes and the like, who cling
about the overcrowded cities. The English
press pays the “Oversea Dominions” the
backhanded compliment of saying that this
Barnett law will be a grand thing for
Canada and Australia. It seems to be known
that the education test is practically only
applied here to Asiatics.

If Greater Sydney had been an actuality,
instead of a mere vision in the air, the
suffering suburbs would not have been so
utterly dependent, the other day, on a few
Private Enterprise gas cos.
and a few hundred super-
heated unionists. The sur-
plus electricity of the Ma
municipality cannot get out
to the suburbs, because the
jealous rabbit-skinned
mayors are in the way; and
the wretched little councils
are themselves too small and
too numerous to run separate
lighting plants. So people
had to do camp-Cooking in
the yard, and potter about
with candles, and while they
did it, The Bulletin hopes
they swore to henceforth and

“Demo’s” bark : u.
Pastor Cape, an English visitor to the Wesleyan
Conference in Melbourne, rapped out a brand-new
idea. He has just been in Fiji, where he was
enraptured by the beautiful Hindus. His idea is
that if Australia is attacked, the Sepoys' from India
must be fetched in. Our own flesh and blood, vital,
integral parts with Us of this glorious British Em-
piah. One hundred and seventy-thousand loval Brit
ish Sepoys rushing to our help. (There’s, only one
dislovalist in India, the chap who flung'the Hardinge
bomb.) Not aliens like Japs or Chinese, but Aus-
tralia’s own brethren-! What a defence they would
be against Asia! Ghollah and Chunder as good as
English. It is a brilliant idea, so new and so re-
assuring that I pass Gape a vote of thanks, and at
once send my subscription to the Pice Society.
A JOE BY ANY OTHER NAME, ETC.
He intended throughout the campaign to call his
opponents the Labor-Socialists, while he himself was
a Liberal-Labor. — J. Cook.
THE CONSTABLE : “Doesn't matter what you
call yourself, Joe, the records ’ll tell what
you ARE.”
Georgie Fairbairn, M.H.R., who disputes
Willie Kelly’s claim as the ideal Johnnie
Boy in politics, tells his elec-
torate that he has no use for
the maternity bonus. “The
Liberal party wants to put the
father of a family in such a
position as not to require the
bonus.” For which reason that
large section of Fat, of which
Georgie is a plump ornament,
has for years instantly granted
every increase of wages that
the workers have asked for,
and has proposed all the meas-
ures in existence which have
improved their social and finan-
cial condition. It all reminds
this paper of the old Lancashire
mill-owner who declared: “My
hands want for nowt. They
wouldn’t have the danged im-
pudence.”
Melbourne is still thudding with the pro-
found silence that followed the report on the
Infectious Diseases Hospital. It was a damn-
ing document, and the public now awaits two
events: (1) A reply by the committee of
management, if one can be devised; and (2)
summary action by the Government to put
the institution on a wholesome, business-like
and trustworthy basis. When he does start
reforming, John Weary had better begin by
re-casting the policy that permits the Gov-
ernment to provide half the cost of main-
taining the institution, yet gives it no say in
its management. To that piece of blastifer-
ous stupidity a lot of the bother is due.
Some casual person who took a hand in
the arrangements for the bv-election in Yass
(N.S.W.) appears to have forgotten
that a polling place was gazetted at
Black Range. People turned up there
to vote, but there was no booth, and
so their opinions on Labor and Wade-
ism remain unknown. Just how the
affair can be settled without going
over the whole business again is a
great mystery; appearances must be
attended to as much as if the election
really mattered.
One of the humors of the Sydney Gas
Strike was the spectacle of Joe Hector Car-
ruthers lecturing the men for having tried
to do the right thing in an unconstitutional
manner. Nobody, of course, remembers
the wire-netting case.
Speaking at Ballarat against the Refer-
enda proposals, Deakin pretended to be hor-
rified at the idea of the Commonwealth
appointing a court to which railway em-
ployees might go for the settlement of their
disputes. Said Alfred :
A Government which had not an interest in the
railways to appoint a tribunal to fix the
wages to be paid to railway men. If the proposal
were agreed to the States would practically cease
to own their own properties.
For some years State Governments have
appointed tribunals to decide what wages
should be paid to the employees of boot
factories, pickle mills, etc., in which
they (the States) have no interest; but there
has been no indication that the manufac-
turers have lost their property, or even their
corpulence. And the folly of Deakin’s resur-
rected observation is all the greater because
the very same people who constitute the
States, and therefore own the railways, also
constitute the Commonwealth.
James Bryce, ex-British Ambassador at
Washington, landed home lately full
cheers for Unification :
The Canadian Federal system had worked wiu
wonderful success. There had been little frioHn
and the two races, British and French had liv h
together in peace and harmony. Canadians eenerain,
had a fine respect for the law, and a nur P
upright judiciary. 1 an<l
Up to date the same James Bryce, who also
inspected our State Frights at close quar
ters, hasn’t had anything to say in their
favor. What he did say was that we should
probably know better presently.
Senator Millen, gibbering at the Referenda
at Kiama (N.S.W.), the place where the
ghosts come from :
The British race occupied its present proud D osi
tion owing to the fact that under its flag it haH
been allowed to carve out its own political affairs
without interference, and the neople of Ns \y
should be left to determine their local government
for themselves.
In other words, the British race occupies its
present proud position because Yorkshire
didn’t waste time projecting bricks at Corn
wall, and Essex didn’t blue-metal Berkshire
when they met in a dark lane. Likewise
the whole boiling of the British counties did
not join pushes to mob the Central Govern
ment. They just attended to their own small
affairs, and allowed the Central Government
to attend its big national affairs. And the
futile Millen reckons that if Australia does
likewise it will be damned.
A bitter wail from Sydney Evening News
(27/2/T3) :
The customs duties are like the taxes of old which
were farmed out to tax-gatherers. The customs
officers collect the money from the importer who
passes it on, with something added, to the wholesale
distributor, and the merchant tacks on a little more
when he sells the goods to the retailer, and the
shopkeeper adds still a bit more to the price which
the consumer has to pay. Each one, importer dis-
tributor, retailer, not only adds the customs duties
to the price, but also something more for interest on
the outlay for duty and for the risk of loss, and also
something for his profit on that amount. The final
result is that the consumer has to pay at least twice
the amount of duty, if not more.
Even with all these drawbacks Australia is
importing about £15,000,000 worth more
goods per annum than it can honestly pay
for, and is running enormously into debt for
its foreign luxuries. The Freetrade paper’s
remedy for all troubles is to abolish the exist-
ing ineffective duties, so that the country
may import still more, and run further into
debt. Another device, which is not that of
the Freetrade paper, is to make the wretch-
edly inefficient duties prohibitive in many
cases, and stop the importation, and obliter-
ate all the swindling middlemen, who,
according to the Freetrade publication, are
the curse of its blessed importing system.
Many big Australian manufacturing con-
cerns already make goods locally, and sell
direct to the retail customer. The process
cuts out freight, marine insurance, commis-
sion, exchange, the importer’s profit, and the
wholesale distributor’s profit. In short, it
brings the maker and the user bang up
against each other. Also, it stops the export
of absurd sums of money, and it gives the
Australian a job. And a job is better than
carrying a faded banner in a procession of
unemployed, and clamoring to the Govern-
ment to borrow another £10,000,000, and
build an unprofitable railway from Dead
Horse or Mad Ox, so as to make a bogus
temporary prosperity.
THE RIVALS.
Mr. Blank followed, vigorously denouncing th«
Government’s reckless borrowing and wasteful ex-
penditure, and scathingly portraying the defects and
delinquencies of Labor administration in everu de
partment.— “Liberal” electioneering item.
THE FAT HAWKER: “ Don't trust him, missus
— he's a low-down, swindling cheat! Give
ME your custom!”
THE MISSUS: “You! Why there's nothing
but wind in YOUR basket!”
Hans Irvine, M.P., is full of optimism, but
it would be better if he took a dash of logic
with it. The other evening he spoke to his
Western constituents (Vic.) and assured
them that the Labor Government was going
in for “frenzied defence.” “There was, he
complacently asserted, “no fear of invasion
here, as we were too far from the base ot
other nations, and Germany and America
would also see that we were safe from
Japan.” So we are too far from Japans
base for invasion, but not too far from Ger-
many’s more distant base for that nation to
rush to gratuitously defend us!
CROMWELL CARMICHAEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What is such legislation but tyranny, fanatical
tyranny, worthy of Oliver Cromwell ?
—Archbishop Kelly, on the education question.
Ca-ampbell Carmichael, your name should be Crum-
mell;
Your fingers are red with the blood of the blest;
You are riding through slaughter, and tied to the
pommel,
The baby is shrieking that’s torn from the breast!
You wade in the gore of the faithful with laughter,
And gay are your pennons, and loud are your
drums ;
But the wraith of our vengeance shall follow you
after:
Campbell Carmichael, the reckoning comes.
Y*u light up the land with the flames of your fury,
Our shrines they are sacked and our saints they are
slain;
But black is the curse with which all will adjure ye
Whenever your name shall be mentioned again!
Your thirst it is slaked with our martyrdom holy,
You butcher our brightest and baton our brave;
But the spirit that’s in us is freshening slowly,
Not even Carmichael can make it a slave!
Thus speaks the Archbishop, at least something like
it,
When the member for Leichhardt comes into his
view,
So I clutch at my harp and I hopefully strike it
With dreams of what Cromwell Carmichael may do.
To miles of orations I’ve lately been listening,
And I wish that this Crom., like his namesake of
yore,
Would come with his pikes and his cuirasses glisten-
ing,
And hustle our mob through the Parliament door.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
At time of writing punters are not being
sorely tempted to pick the winner of Sydney Cup.
Everything with a long-distance reputation and a
favorably-handicapped appearance is at a short price
on the lists, and even little Almissa, who looks some-
what overweighted on the Bst 111 b. mark, is quoted
at only 10 or 12 to one. Uncle Sam (Bst. 61b.),
Hallowmas (Bst. 41b.) and Jacamar (Bst. 91b.) are
the nominal favorites. If the chestnut Uncle could
be guaranteed on his Caulfield Cup form, he would
look the pick of the handicap. For that matter, the
trainer seems quite satisfied that Uncle is in great
buckle. But his recent performance at Flemington
did the big horse no credit, nor is it certain that
he will take kindly to travelling the Randwick
course. Up to now Uncle Sam has been a nervous,
awkward customer, anyhow, whereas Hallowmas has
already won two good races on the A.J.C. ground.
The imported horse has not been unduly penalised
for his second to Piastre in the Melbourne Cup ; he
is probably improved by further acclimatisation ; and
if W. H. Smith has the mount next Monday, the
chance of Hallowmas can he reasonably preferred to
that of Uncle Sam or Jacamar, though the latter is
suspected of powers which have previously been more
honored in the rumor than the performance. With-
out considering the dozen and one chances of an
unexpected “turn-up” for the rich Svdney Cup, this
onlooker puts his half-dollar on Hallowmas.
“0.K.”: The Footscray Council is pro-
testing against the V.R.C.’s belated proposal to
charge Is. for admission to Flemington Flat on race
day®. One humorless councillor said that “ever
since he had known the flat it had been open to the
public free of charge, and he thought it was mon-
strous to make a charge now,” which intensely Tory
argument seems to express the opinion of all the in-
dignant democrats who have written The Bulletin
on this subject of free race-going any time during
the past 20 years. It is clear as daylight that
Flemington racecourse is no more of a democratic
institution than Randwick or Caulfield, or any other
expensively appointed show-place where the mini-
mum charge of admission is Is. The public pays
11s. 6d. for seats or standing room in the Grand
Stand enclosure (dress-circle or stalls), and 3s. 6d.
for ditto on the Hill (amphitheatre), as though
Flemington were an open-air theatre. Their money
mainly provides the entertainment which the “flat-
ites” have been seeing for nix all these years. The
army of members at £6 a year (plus entrance fee)
can be classed as dress-circle season ticket pur-
chasers. Owners of horses gamble among them-
selves in entry fees, and bookmakers pay something
for the privilege of living on the punters ; but the
management’s receipts are mostly gate money. If
nobody paid to go in, there’d be no show worth men-
tioning to attract the dead heads, on whose behalf
the councillors of smellful Footscray are now blath-
ering. One of these illogical persons said, “Hundreds
of families made a picnic day of Cup Day on the
flat, and did not take any interest in racing, and
he would ask, ‘Why should these people be charged ?’
The revenue would be used to build more palaces
for those who patronised the lawn.” The gall of
that councillor! Cup Day is a public holiday be-
cause the money of the paying nublic has made
Flemington what it is, and given a great attraction
to its principal race. Otherwise there never would
have been a Cup Day holiday nor any picnics. The
alleged hundreds of families who take no interest in
racing are indebted to the Cup for their annual out-
ing, and they go to Flemington Flat to devour sand-
wiches and things not because the stinks that blow
o’er the Saltwater River from Footscray give a
charm to that open space in an ordinary way, but
because the providers of gate-money for the V.R.C.
have supplied them with an exciting scene. The
Flat, considered apart from the racing surroundings,
is the last place on God’s earth where anv wise
familv would go to picnic, but if those hundreds of
Cun Dav visitors are dead struck on it, they can go
and brood on its flatness 340 days a year, free of
charge. There is a terrible lot of picturesque picnic
space to spare within a few miles of Melbourne
GP O. Nobodv needs to rush to Flemington Flat
in order to take no interest in the racing. Nobodv
should ever have been allowed to go there gratis if
what the Wowsers say about the gambling evil is
half true. Flemington on race days is a gaming-
place ; and with the example of dear old England to
warn them, the legislators of Victoria ought not to
have licensed a metropolitan racing club that gave
free admission to impecunious punters. No good
argument—sporting, social or judicial—can be ad-
vanced in favor of a free racecourse. The public
that is bound to’ pay for its melodrama, its circus
and its cinematograph show should be the more cer-
tainly hound to pav for its dissipation on a race-
course. Why should the punter who goes to the
Flat to bet escape the payment of a reasonable
charge—that he mav have one more shilling to drop
into the maw of Moses? Whv should the person
who takes no interest in racing want to go where
racing is on Cup or any other dav? Whv should the
horsey-minded sport, who doesn’t bet (such people
are possible! he granted au intereetiP 0 ' entertain-
ment free of charge on the flat, when others of the
same sort must pay to keep the entertainment
going ? * * *

Some of E. E. Oatley’s winnings on Re-
lievo went to buy Gillamatong last week. The four-
vear-old son of Trafalgar’s mother was probably a
bargain at 800 guineas. As a youngster he was at
the top of the tree; last season he ran only once
(nowhere) ; and the other day he won a race, his
first for two years, in a decidedly coming-on style.
If the half-brother to Trafalgar stands training he
may develop into a stayer.
* * * *
An interesting demonstration of the influ-
ence of currents was given by the mast of the lost
Sydney yacht Thelma, which was wrecked about a
mile and a half inside Port Jackson Heads. On
Tuesday last a man observed some wreckage at the
Dee Why beach, about eight or 10 miles away north
on the ocean front. When the pilot steamer picked it
up it turned out to be the mast of the Thelma,
which had been carried out through the Heads and
swept along the coast. So far the body of the lost
vachtsman has not been recovered, and the nautical
folk believe it, too, has been swept out to sea, and
that if ever it is cast up it will be on the ocean
beach north of Manly.
* * * *
Saturday was another bad day on Port
Jackson, with a vicious westerly tearing crevasses
in the water. It was the Prince Alfred day out, and
the objective was the King Edward VII. trophy.
The only yacht to come to the line under full sail
was Culwulla 111., all the rest blowing along under
restricted hamper. The early starters made terrific
pace to Manly, and so did Culwulla 111. when she
shook out that huge sail and caught all the winds of
Heaven in it. Sunbeam was the first to appear at
Shark Island, followed afar by Mag'C, behind which
Yuelba and Petrel were as usual duelling. Behind
them again were the three big yachts, Sayonara,
Culwulla 111. and Rawhiti, in that order. Sunbeam
was about 20min. ahead of Sayonara. Then the
wind chopped round to south-east, which suited Sun-
beam so well that Yuelba retired and Sayonara
didn’t trouble to round the fort. Culwulla held on,
but before she made the turn at Fort Denison, Sun-
■beam was rounding the Pile Light on the home run.
Magic had a mishap and dropped out, and Petrel
and Culwulla alone continued the vain pursuit. Sun-
beam had bolted altogether, and won by a margin of
7min. 14sec. from Petrel, and 12min. 20sec. from
Culwulla 111.
What a wonder old George Holmes is
with his equally wonderful old boat, the Donnelly!
He was the only skipper to finish in the previous
week’s bad blow in Sydney Harbor, and last Satur-
day he again demonstrated his prowess by beating
the very best of them in the final of the Flying
Squadron’s handicap. The first heat had looked a
sure thing for Advance, which, excellently handled,
made a splendid run over the first half of the course,
only to come to grief on the second and be compelled
to make way for Arline, Nimrod and Eunice in that
order. In the second heat. Kismet, the champion
boat, quite easilv defeated Donnelly, and so did
Golding, which ran into second place. But in the
final the veteran opened out his whole hag of tricks,
and though Arline fought him every inch of the wav,
the old man won, by swinging his boat more smartlv
round the corners. Kismet, the champion, could
finish only third in the final.
» » * *
Port Jackson just missed by a hair’s-
breadth another tragedy on Saturday. Mr. Wads-
worth, owner of the yacht Aoma, was steering his
own craft in the P.A.Y. Club race, when a stranger
ranged alongside and gibed. So close was the
stranger that the heavy boom swept Aoma’s deck,
and, knocking Wadsworth down, pinned him to the
deck. It was a miracle that his skull was not
smashed in or his neck broken. As prevention is
better than cure, something ought to be done to keep
careless or unskilful yachtsmen from prancing over
the face of the harbor, endangering the lives of
other people; if it hasn’t got one already, the
Navigation Department should frame a set of regu-
lations to put down the dangerous capers.
Arnst has announced that he will not row
on the Richmond, but he has not withdrawn his de-
posit, so he apparently believes the Paddon crowd
will give way. It is hard to see why they should.
The rules give them the right to name the
meeting-place, and it is a piece of presumption on
Arnst’s part to talk as he is doing. He would have
been perfectly within his rights had he said when
issuing his challenge that it was impossible for him
to row anywhere else than on the Parramatta. But
he challenged in the usual way, and kicked
up the bobbery afterwards. Thie chances are
certainly that, in spite of all the non-payers
who will cover the river with their motor-
launches, and all the people who will look on
from the shore for nothing, the Parramatta will
yield a bigger, gate than the Richmond. That river
is just as easily overlooked as the Parramatta, and
it is hard to see where the boats to carry a decent
“gate” can be got from at Richmond. Arnst’s re-
quest has, therefore, something behind it; hut, like
the gasmen, he’s going the wrong way about the
job.
* * * *
Saturday saw the commencement of the
12th round of First-Grade Cricket in Sydney. Some
of the batsmen were in form, Bardslev heading the
list with a neat 121 for Glebe against Redfern. The
other century-maker was Bull, of Middle Harbor,
who smacked up 107 against Petersham. Maclean,
of Gordon, had hard luck —he had got to 98 when
stumps were drawn. Trumper in the same match
hit up 73 before being clean howled bv Noble. Bar-
bour was eroing great guns for University, and had
piled up 72 when the light gave out. Scores from
30 upwards were thick as blackberries at Bulli.
Coomev, of the University, was top howler, with
four Burwood wickets for 37. Coffey, of Svdnev, got
four of Central Cumberland’s for 40, and his club
mate Rowe three for 33. In spite of Bardsley’s 121
Glebe only oiled up 288 against Redfern, which,
however, did not show much promise in reply,
promptly losing two wickets for eight runs, Bur-
wood is in a had wav with University ; dismissed for
144, it has had 148 smacked off its bowling for three
wickets. Central Cumberland was at home to Syd-
ney at Parramatta, and hit up 234 bv way of wel-
come. Svdney lost one wicket for 34. Balmain
plaved all over North Svdnev, and hanged 312 for
eight wickets, so North Svdnev is again in a state of
gloom. Gordon slogged the Paddington howling to
the tune of 298 for nine wickets, and Middle Harbor
smote Petersham to glorv with 381. towards which
Bull’s 107 was a valuable contribution.
* * * *
In Melbourne on Saturday the windows of
Heaven were opened and the waters were spilled with
violence upon the earth. The result was that all
pennant matches, save that between Prahran and
North Melbourne, were postponed; and there were
some people who wished that had been postnoned
also. They mostly live round Prahran way, for North
Melbourne, with Brascher 63 and Stuckey 32 not
out, smacked up 113 for the loss of only two wickets.

“C. J.W.”: Re spectacled cricketers and
footballers (B. 6/3/’l3), and the query as to
whether there has been a spectacled player under
Australian rules. Dr. Bennie, who played for Mel-
bourne in its championship days, when the game was
very much rougher than it is at present, always wore
specs., and was one of the popular cracks. I believe
there were two brothers Bennie in the team, but
“Specs.” is a certainty.
* * * *
Somebody writes that in the years a-rear
E. Rees, of the Parnell Club, Auckland (M.L.), in-
variably wore his glasses while playing Rugby. Rees
played a strenuous game at half-back and was an
Auckland “rep.” in 1891-1894.

Jim Barry, the Yankee bruiser who fought
a few fights at the Svdney Stadium some time ago, got
himself disliked at Brisbane on Saturday night. He
was matched with Sam Langford, and just before
entering the ring demanded and got his purse. It
is quite common in the U.S.A., where managers and
promoters spring up like mushrooms in the night,
for the gentry who supply the stoush to get their
cash before delivering the battery, but the practice
is unknown in Australia. However, the management
yielded, and lived to regret it. Half-way through
ithe first round Langford put one on the ribs and
Barry sank down, took the full count, and then rose
and explained briefly that his rib was broken. With
that he hurried from the ring. The audience de-
clined to believe his statement and howled epithets
at him, and when it was known that he had col-
lected his cash in advance, the genera,! opinion of
Barry’s genuineness grew no better with lightning
rapidity. Unless the young man produces medical
testimony that his rib is broken, he can confidently
rely upon having no more fights m Australia, wot
that he will be missed. His fighting was alway
painful to watch because he is so gloriously ignorant
of the rudiments of boxing. He can do most good
for the game by making way for better men.^
Wednesday night saw the Stadium pro-
duce two scraps. The preliminary was a 10- round
bout between Cox and Burns. There was said to
be onlv 21b. difference in their weights, which shows
how deceitful appearances are. Burns was a fair
youngster with a shock of sandy hair, while the
other was dark as a sloe. Both were fierce as tiger
eats; also, Cox carried a deadly wallop in both
fists, and was particularly quick with thei left. Last
year saw Burns at the Stadium among the amateurs,
and he seems to have started fighting before he
learned to box. He is dogged as they are made, and
worries on to his man all the time like a bull terrier.
But he doesn’t know how to hit, and is not alto-
gether sure how to protect his face. He is, how-
ever, a very iron-faced youth, and took a series of
wallops that would have made an iron pot feel
weary. But in boxing, as in international warfare
ferocity goes for nothing unless there has been
solid and careful preparation to make it effective.
* * * *
An Australian fighter of whom the world
is likely to hear much more in the near future is
Gordon Cogill, the artilleryman. Fresh from the
amateurs, he has had only three fights, and won
them all in short order. On Wednesday night last week
he smashed up Ewars in less than half a round and
did it so thoroughly with three wallops that it was
several minutes before Ewars realised what had hap-
pened. The new-comer is of the Mace style, shoulders
square and head thrown well back. He hits like
lightning, and the force of his blow is as the kick of
a mule. But he will have a bad time if ever he
attains championship honors; he will be hunted to
death by wild women. His physique is easily the
most handsome ever seen in Sydney Stadium, while
his action is the acme of easy grace. As a specimen
of Australian manhood somebody ought to take nim
to Nelson Illingworth, and have him cast m bronze
before his ring glories dower him with a broken nose
and a cauliflower ear or two.
* * *
.On Wednesday last two car-loads of
pressmen went out to Hunter’s Hill to see Johnny
Summers at work ; and Johnny worked his mightiest
—except at hitting his sparring partners. He was
very tender with them, having had a sad experience
during the week, when, in a moment of abstraction,
he caught one under the chin and outed hirn for
quite a while. It was an accident, but that and his
work with the punching bag suggest that Summers
has a much harder wallop than when he was here
before. The small boy was present, having slipped
in between the legs of the big ones, and afterwards
this scribe proceeded to interview the kid. Well,
what did you think of it?” The small boy never
hesitated. “Not much! He didn’t make nobodv s
nose bleed!” he said with fine scorn. Then, taking
a sudden dislike to publicity, he went out the way
he came in, between the legs of the big ones. The
small boy is very Roman in his tastes.

The fight between Dave Smith and Les
O’Donnell on Saturday was characterised by pluck
and endurance that made it one of the Sydney
Stadium’s most stirring battles. That an unusual
scrap was expected was made plain by the crowd
which attended; the great enclosure was absolutely
packed. O’Donnell had the benefit of the difference
of about 51b. in the weights. The fight started with
a bound and went with a rush. Both men were evi-
dently in perfect nick. The slogging was heavy,
too, but up till the 10th round it would lave been
hard to say which fighter had the advantage. It was
a scrap calculated to make a sympathetic soul weep
for the referee. But in the 10th a sudden change
came o’er the ’scape. Smith got home a few that
knocked a lot of the stamina out of O’Donnell, and then
sent in a couple that hurled him against the ropes.
He rebounded, to fall and stay down for nine seconds;
staggered up to meet one on the chin that caused
him to sink to his knees for another nine; then he
got up and fought like a tiger at bay. But Smith
never gave him a moment’s respite, and crowded
right in, hurling blows all the while. One of them
caught O’Donnell on the chin, and sent him stagger-
ing across the ring. Smith came down like a bliz-
zard ; but, somehow, O’Donnell went to meet him.
Another right dazed him; a shower of blows literally
beat him to the floor. But he got up again, and
came back still unconquered. Another shower of
blows and a vicious uppercut rocked him, and a
heavy right floored him for the fourth time in the
same round; but the gong saved him. To say that
the crowd went mad conveys nothing. It literally
howled. The way O’Donnell pulled himself together
during the minute’s respite was simply marvellous.
He came out and attacked Smith with dogged grit.
But he was done; so when he slipped in the 13th,
apparently from sheer weakness, Inspector Matthews
called a halt; and Smith, of course, was declared the
winner. It was an amazing fight, and if O’Donnell
can bring his skill to the same high standard as his
grit and stamina —well, he’s a world-beater, easily.

Billiardist Geo. Gray, when passing
through Fremantle recently, told an interviewer that
the old idea that it was unwise for a cueist to in-
dulge in anv form of exercise was exploded. Speak-
ing personally, he went in strongly for physical
exercise, but was careful about the use of his arms.
He made it a rule never to carry a weight in his
hands, not even a suit case. When George G. breasts
the waves of matrimony, he will probably find that
the small voice which tearfully complains of the
large pain during the wee hours will demand to be
taken into the paternal grasp regardless of the risk
of spoiling a losing-hazard stroke.

At a recent open hill-climb for motor-
hikes in Adelaide (4i miles') the fastest time went
to a machine known as “The Kent,” the engine of
which was made in Adelaide and not from im-
ported parts. It was designed and manufactured
by a young local engineer, and it is the second time
he has made the fastest time against a crowd of the
best imported machines, although on formula he
could not win.

A loud groan rose from the motoring world
recently when the news came through that the
American yield of petroleum, from which petrol is
obtained, had during 1912 decreased by 250,000
barrels of 42 gallons each. But the Yankee oil
pirates managed to squeeze £3,200,000 more out
of the citizens of the planet for the reduced output.
However, there was a gleam through the murk when
the cable announced that one of the London motor-
’bus cos. had invented a new fluid which it can retail
to its drivers at lOld. per gallon, and hoped thereby
to end the strike of the jehus. Presumably the new
fuelwill shortly be placed on the market, and, also
presumably, it is the coal-tar product benzol, men-
tioned in this column about-two months back. May
it come quickly, is the prayer of the righteous.

The Inter-State Motor-Car Reliability
Test is now an assured thing, and will start at Syd-
ney on Wednesday, March 26. Four days will be
allowed in which to reach Melbourne, the stopping
nlaces being Goulburn, Gundagai and Wangaratta.
The prizes are trophies valued at £4O, £2O and
£lO. The manner of scoring is peculiar. Each
contestant will start with 900 noints (500 for reli-
ability, 200 for petrol consumption and 200 for hill
climbing), and what he has to do is to keep those
points intact. Deductions will he made for mechani-
cal repairs and adjustments, broken spring v,
axles, etc. The man retaining the greatest „ , at

Six-day races pay on the Continong
parently, as the promoters of the little nroc’eaZ!
recently run in Paris, won by Goullet, the Am
tralian, brought the promoters £4OOO clear nrnfit
The takings for one day swam up to £2BBO i i
they were not mean with the prizes, either m
£3OOO being given as “specials.” These conW
don’t bring anything like this money in Australia
There are whispers that in at least one recent vm
ture in these parts the riders' percentage of the
was so poor that the men would have done better
if they had stuck to their ordinary jobs. It seems
to be really an indoor game, if it is a game at all
and in spite of the golden promise of the first event
of the sort run in Sydney, it has proved disappoint
ing for both riders and promoters.

The latest from the United States is the
“automobile house.” It is built like a drawn-out
motor-’bus, with a body 25ft. long. Most of the in
terior is taken up by a “state-room,” with sleeping
berths for five people. Another room has accomno-
dation for four more people, while two servants and
a kitchenette are stowed away in the tail. It sounds
a bit cramped, but the wealthy seekers after a new
sensation are rushing the idea and taking to what
they are pleased to term the simple life in the
scenic parts of the country.

That weird little contraption, the cycle
car, is coming along at a great rate, and has already
made such an impression that it is to have a place
in this year’s French Grand Prix. Of course, it
won’t compete with the big, giant-powered roarers,
but it and the motor-cycles will divide the day after
the big event between them, and race over a 12-
mile circuit on July 13. The results of the test of
the new contraption will be eagerly awaited all over
the world.

So Jake de Rosier’s famous motor-cycle
record for the hoar has been smashed at last, and
on the track whereon it was established, that of
Los Angeles (U.S.A.), where Jake ran 83 miles 135
yards. L. Humiston. the new champion, flew over
88 miles 350 vards in the 60 minutes, covered the
century in 68min. 1 4-ssec., and established a new
set of world’s records from 13 miles up. This
multiplication of records becomes wearisome.

“I HAVE
RECEIVED A
SECOND LIFE"
.. THt 7T/*f>esT
Hundreds of thousands of people have derived
immeasurable benefits
From Sanatogen
Thousands of them have written to the proprietors
to say so. Their testimony records marvellous results,
which, until its discovery, could never have been obtained
by any means at the d spo-al of the physician.
Among the writers are many celebrities with whose
names
You will
be as familiar as with your own.
Tens of thousands of doctors throughout the world
have prescribed Sanatogen, which a medical authority,
writing in The Medical Press and Circular, states, “has
stren thened the physician’s hand a hundredfold,’’ while,
he adds, “the wonders brought about by this prepara-
tion ate no less manifold than amazing.”
This is high praise for any preparation to
Receive
but it has been endorsed by innumerable statements.
Here, for instance, is one by that famous Authoress,
Madame Sarah Grand : “ Sanatogen has done everything
for me which it is said to be able to do for cases of
nervous weakness and exhaustion. I began to take it
after nearly four vears’ enforced idleness from extreme
weakness, and felt the benefit almost immediately. And
now, after taking it steaddy three times a day for
twelve weeks, I find myself able to enjoy both work
and play again, and also able to do as much of both as I
ever did.”
To be so revitalised is, indeed, in Shakespeare s
words, to receive
A Second Life
That experience may be duplicated by every reader
of these words, for Sanatogen so influences the nervous
and muscular svstems, the digestion and the great blood-
making organs, that it restores the normal balance dis-
organised by illness or disease.
Sanatogen is sold by all Chemists, in tins, at 2s. 6d.,
3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d.
An int resting and instructive booklet, entitled
“The Art of Living,” will be sent, post free, to all

SOME HOLIDAY VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Holiday Longings.
Mi for the sea; I lore its ailver splashing
O* the long hdt' beaches when the tide
runs home;
The sweet, cool thrill of the water, and
the flashing
Of the sunset tintings on its lace-white
foam.
Me for the bush, and the fern trees in the
gully,
The dong of the bell-bird as the dusk
stoops low,
The far camp-fire in the clearing, glowing
dully,
The scents that sweet the breezes where
the wild musks grow.
Me for the hills, and the sombre peaks at
morning,
When the red sun-flames fire the shroud-
ings of the mist;
The sheer, far steeps with the waterfall’s
adorning;
The white of flung clematis in the valley’s
amethyst.
Me for the flats that sprawl beside the
river,
The reeds’ quiet whisper on the dark
pool’s breast
When the hot day faints and the night
winds shiver
The haze above the grasses—ah, I love
the river best.
N.S.W.
THE SNAKE.
Barby.
The creek, beneath the rowan tree,
Is not as brown as Barby’s eyes,
For, though it ripples limpidly,
The creek, beneath the rowan tree,
Is shallow, as the world may see,
And steals its beauty from the skies.
The creek beneath the rowan tree
Is not as brown as Barby’s eyes.
The berries from the rowan tree
Are not as red as Barby’s mouth.
Her lips more crimson are to see
Than berries from the rowan tree.
Although they glow alluringly
In the soft breezes from the south
The berries from the rowan tree
Are not as red as Barby’s mouth.
The starlings in the rowan tree
Are not so black as Barby’s hair,
And when its braids are shaken free
The starlings in the rowan tree
May shake their plumage anxiously
And droop their feathers in despair.
The starlings in the rowan tree
Are not as black as Barby’s hair.
The berries in the rowan tree
Look passing sweet in Barby’s hair.
When starlings whistle happily
Her eager eyes are good to see.
The chill creek water, cold and free,
Makes her red lips look very fair.
The berries in the roivan tree
Look passing siceet in Barby’s hair.

CHRISTINA M.
Acushla.
I named her twice, I named her thrice,
I named her ten times over;
The wind heard, and the singing bird,
And the bee in the creamy clover.
Acushla! Acushla!
The cushat dove is cooing;
It's little that a man may do
Whose heart’s a-hot with wooing.
I left the field, the harvest yield—
The grain was ripe to falling—
And ran and ran, a crazy man,
And I the whole time calling—
Acushla! Acushla!
The cushat dove is cooing;
When Love is keeping holiday,
What worn is worth the doino?
Her feet were fleet, her pretty feet,
Upon the hill and hollow ;
She bade me stay, she cried me naj
And still her eyes said, “Follow!’
Acushla! Acushla!
The cushat dove is cooing.
To capture her was sweet, indeed,
Yet sweeter the pursuing.

RODERIC QUINN.
Three Cities.
Hobart.
Scarce more than child, her arms so filled
With apple blossoms that she spilled
Some wayward sprays upon her track,
She tripped from out the mountain mist
With bright eyes full of wonder wist.
Blown, as the wind willed, down her back,
The tumbled beauty of her hair
Lent to the orchard-scented air
A perfume, subtle-sweet and rare;
Her lips red manna, that the cream
Of her smooth skin made redder seem,
Pouted as if displeased a while
Then parted L the sweetest smile,
Showing within the gleaming pearls
Of just the sweetest girl of girls.
I sought to filch, in loving stealth,
One kiss of all those red lips’ wealth,
But vainly! Up the mountain slope
She sped away—and with her. Hope.
But almost out of sight, she stopped
To fling a kiss to me, and dropped
Some apple blossoms from her store
To make me cherish her the more.
Then, eyes still full of wonder wist,
She hid her from me in the mist.
Melbourne
The gown she wears is quite the latest style,
There’s just the right politeness in her
smile;
Beneath her rustling lingerie she shows
The proper height of silken, high-clocked
hose
To win the connoisseur’s unstinted praise.
Her figure is delightful (for her stays
Are built by those well versed in Paris
ways!)
And through her veil a pair of flashing eyes
Throw out a challenge, full of bold emprise
To whom may read them, promising a flow
Of Pomeroy and Mumm and Veuve Cliquot,
A night of song and corybantic dance,
With only one thing wanting—Sweet Ro-
mance.
Perth.
The charm of mystery is in her eyes,
Tinging with wistful sadness all her face :
As one entranced with older memories
She fronts the future, sees its phantoms pace
In lonely inland vigil, huge with dreams
Wherein no hint of wizard menace seems.
She sees them. . .but her thoughts are other-
where,
Flung backward to a youth that ne’er was
young,
A love made lovelier by its own despair, _
Foiled of its purpose and with passion
wrung.
She looks—a smile is on her lips: she peers
With subtle, strange intentness into Time :
Who knows what stellar murmurings she
hears,
Crooned by the lips of Silence into rhyme?

BERNARD INGLEBY.
On Board a Ship.
How fine, I thought to take a trip
Remote from every worldly care,
And live at peace on board a ship—
All a delusion and a snare.
Romance, I thought, would roam the deck.
And call forth words of love so dear,
But “Oh, that cat!” and “What a neck!”
Are all the words I overhear.
Strange is the product of the lip
On board a ship.
The passengers recount their woe:
“None are so poorly fed as they,
The sluggish ship should faster go,
Their ills will surely turn them grey.”
All the base fabric of a dream, *
Hark to the other side, 1 beg.
For things are not quite what they seem.
The boot is on the other leg.
Bare of its mask the Truth we’ll strip
On board a ship.
No trouble could compare with that
Borne in grim silence by the crew ;
The doctor, barber and ship’s cat
Have really more than is their due.
An officer has bad luck too,
When in some corner of the deck
A damsel fair, with eyes of blue,
Will thrust an arm about his neck.
For hours he must endure this grip
On board a ship.
The captain hardly sleeps a wink.
The trials that he must endure
Would drive a weaker man to drink,
His job is no mere sinecure ;
When some old lady asks him, “Sir,
What would you do if we went down?”
Forgive him if he answers her,
“Just drown, good woman, simply drown.”
I think he often gets the pip
On board his ship.
The quartermaster has his woes,
His is no life of honeyed Miss
As up and down the deck he goes
Pursued by some precocious miss,
Who wants her deck chair turned around,
Or some such other foolish whim,
A hairpin lost that must be found,
And so she scares the life of him.
In wrath he goes and takes a nip
On board a ship.
A dog’s own life the steward lives
For twenty-six long hours a day,
As drop by drop his blood he gives
For merely miscroscopic pay.
To please the crowd he’d surely need
A body like an omnibus,
The legs of some large centipede,
And arms like any octopus.
Oh. far from adequate his tip
On board a ship.

The Contradictions of Mabel.
The dainty frocks of Mabel,
The patter of her feet,
Have made my ways unstable
• And filled my world with heat:
Yea, Hades’ self, it seems to me.
Dwells in her lace and lingerie.
Her dark eyes kind and smiling.
Her hair as soft as night.
Were made for men’s beguiling.
And fashioned for delight;
And all that walk in trousers feel
Her sweetness draw like bands of steel.
About the painted city
I love to see her roam,
It seems a deuced pity
That ever she comes home ;
For various serpents coil and hiss
Amid our own domestic bliss.
My heart goes out to greet her
When in the morning fair
The happy wind grows sweeter
With whispers of her hair;
I thrill to all my finger tips
To kiss the rosebud of her lips.
If only I could hold her
Remote and far apart.
In dreams alone to fold her
Close to my beating heart,
This common world would straightway 1
Replete with wafts of deity.
But ill it is to measure
The woes that round me curl
Fast rooted in the treasure
Of one resplendent girl.
The saddest theme that I can sing
Is Mabel’s shining wedding ring.
Bound by that golden fetter
To beauty, love and joy.
The fates arrange the better
My gladness to destroy ;
For life that holds us in Us scorn
Constructs all roses with a thorn.
My will is all a Babel
Of loud conflicting noise;
I want to hold my Mabel
The chief of all my joys,
The while I long to burst apart
Her irking meshes round my heart.
This difficult arrangement
Some kind god ought to make,
To cause a warm estrangement
For peace and pity’s sake;
For what I really want to do
Is have my girl and lose her too!

whelming proofs of purity,
quality and strength, or show
so long a record of successful
results.
DOCTORS every-
where recommend
SCOTT’S,
because SCOTT’S Emulsion has
no equal as a builder-up of the
human system, as a strength-maker lor
all. PROVE THIS. One bottle of
SCOTT’S will convince you.

ANTIN EU RASTHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address
in Australia on receipt of 2d. in stamps to cover
postage by the wholesale representative, H. A. God-

From the Old Soldier : —•.
The report that two cases of diphtheria have
occurred at the Light Horse camp at the capital site
will be a weapon ready to the hands of those who
are looking for flaws in the Commonwealth defence
scheme. The men had been sent into camp to give
brilliancy to the ceremony of naming the capital,
and it happened that they had had several days of
cold, wet weather following on a spell of heat. A
good many of the wretched bell tents, which were
their only protection from the weather, had been
blown down by the gale of the previous Saturday
night, and those that remained standing had the
single cloth of their roofs penetrated by the ram,
and everything inside was drenched. Quite likely,
to most of them, going into camp was nothing new.
But the man who goes camping for his own pleasure
has a fly to his tent, and so has two thicknesses of
cloth to keep out the weather. He can pitch his
camp where he likes, and can always get under some
sort of shelter. His tent, which is oblong, even if it
is only a 6ft. x Bft., will let him stand upright
under the ridge-pole. The soldier’s tent, on the
other hand, has to be pitched like part. of. a mathe-
matical puzzle on open ground, where it is exposed
to every wind, and its conical form makes it im-
possible for a man to stand upright in it. Bell tents
cost £5 each at Woolwich Arsenal, are short-lived,
and will onlv hold a dozen men. It would, there-
fore be infinitely cheaper for the Commonwealth to
house its soldiers in barracks, which would be much
healthier to live in, not to speak of the extra com-
fort they would give. Armies never encamp now in
real war. Thev cannot get transport for the hun-
dreds of tons of tents thev would need, so going into
camp is not “a service condition.”
Item from the Empire Trade commission
session at Christchurch (M.L.) :
Chairman (to J. B. Hall, representing the local
Agricultural and Pastoral Ass.) : You all talk about
wanting labor, but you don t do anything to help
yourselves.
Hall: No. , ,
Chairman: You wait for the- Government to do
something for you.
Hall: We always do.
There’s one thing about the great Backbone
—it’s well covered with hide.
It is notorious that Victoria’s Licenses
Reduction Board has improved the “tem-
perance” aspect of social life bv closing up
unnecessary hotels, and those conducted in
an unpleasant, undesirable and sometimes
illegal manner; that it' is, in fact, doing more
satisfactory work in one year than a dozen
cold-tea fanatics could do in a score. Yet,
one J. C. Martin—a parson, of course —now
accuses it of “buttressing the trade by pro-
viding more seductive houses of entertain-
ment.” Apparently Martin wants places like
Scott’s, the Oriental, the White Hart and
Champion’s wiped out, and the frowsy, un-
kempt beershops that used to disgrace the
“Little” city streets and lanes left un-
touched. At the same time, he probably
wonders why fair-minded people have a
whole-hearted contempt for the Wowser, and
refuse to take him and his howlings seri-
ously.


What Those Who Know Say of the
bea:le high-grade pianos.
A •
Xne great majority of our Pianos are sold on the personal recommendation of users, and we are
constantly receiving letters from our customers praising the BEALE High-grade PIANOS. Our
instruments aie in use in every part of Australia ; in New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia,
Mauritius, South Africa, India, and on the continent of Europe ; and everywhere they give the
same unbounded satisfaction.
Below we give a few (greatly condensed) extracts from unsolicited testimonials from buyers of
Beale High-grade Pianos.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
Mr. F. OWEN, jun., Hon. Sec. School of Arts,
Tuena: —
“Piano has Riven every satisfaction. People com-
petent to judge say it is the best instrument in the
district.”
Mrs. J. A. SWAIN, Kilphysic, Caroll:—
“Has tood the changeable seasons remarkably well.
We are all very pleased with it.”
Mr. G. JONES, Canterbury:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction. No hesitation
in recommending the Beale to anyone as the finest
piano procurable.”
Mr. E. E. VIDLER, Morisset: —
“Piano is in perfect order, notwithstanding the
fact that it has been in constant use.”
Mrs. ELLEN KILLEEN, Wolfram Street, Broken
Hill: —
“Has given every satisfaction. Tone is rich and
full; instrument has stood the Broken Hill climate
wonderfully ; better than any other piano that I know
of. Would recommend the Beale Piano to anyone who
wants a real good piano.”
Mrs. JOAN MASSIE, 44 Hunter Street, Newcastle: —
“The tone exceeds my expectations, being wonder-
fully mellow, while the external finish is very hand-
some. Several professionals have expressed their ad-
miration.”
Mrs. C. JENNINGS, Blende Street, Broken Hill:—
“Better to-day than when it was supplied to me
five years ago, and we have had some very severe
weather since then. The tone improves with use.
Can recommend the Beale Piano to anyone requir-
ing a first-class piano for tone, touch and dura-
bility.”
Mrs. F. RT.TD.pOCK, Waimea, Walgett Street, Ka-
tooinba: —
“Highly delighted with it.”
Mr. J. SLATER, Killarney, East Moree:—
“Wish to express my fullest satisfaction in every
way with the instrument.”
Mr. J. HOGG, Lithgow:—
“Piano has given perfect satisfaction.”
Mr. CHARLES R. RAYNER, Sec. Oddfellows’ Lodge,
Casino:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction.”
Mr. A. GREEN, Burwood Street Junction, New-
castle :
“The time that it will remain in tune is wonder-
ful. I have had English and foreign pianos, but they
never remained in tune a quarter of the time, nor
came near the Beale for tone.”
Mrs. W. O’HARA, Wyalong:—
“More than pleased with my piano. Everyone who
has heard it admires its beautiful tone.”
Miss A. M. RUDDER, Kempsey:—
“Have no hesitation in saying that it would be
impossible to get a more satisfactory instrument
from every standpoint. Its tone is to-day as soft
and brilliant, and its appearance as handsome as
the day it was bought.”
Mrs. C. C. GRAHAM, Temoin Street, Trangie:—
“Very pleased with Beale Piano. Always ready
to recommend your pianos to anyone requiring a
first-class instrument.”
Mrs. P. POWER, Rose Mount, Forest Hill, Wagga:—
“May mention that I am very pleased with the
piano you sent me. Tone is very rich.”
Mrs. H. B. WALLACE, Glenroy, Bertram Street,
Mortlake:—•
“Piano is a ‘gem.’ Has given every satisfaction.”
QUEENSLAND.
Mrs. M. McKINNON, 357 Bolsover Street, Rock-
hampton :
“Piano is perfect. A friend of nine who was
prejudiced against the Beale Piano, .ecided to get
one when she heard mine.”
Mr. A. R. ROBINSON, See. People's . 'rressive
League, Adelaide Street, Brisbane:—
“Piano is giving great satisfaction. Many .
expressed their surprise at such a high-grade instru-
ment being manufactured in Australia.
Mrs. M. WARD, Mount Perry, via Bunduberg:—
“We are all very well satisfied with tie piano.
Tone is excellent.”
VICTORIA.
Mr. J. H. BAYNE, Carnarvon Street, Auburn: —
“A superb instrument with a magnificent tone.
Friends admire it greatly.”
Miss GLADYS WAITE, Norong, via Rutherglen:—
“The piano has given me entire satisfaction.”
Mrs. G. M. GOULD, Thomson Street, Hamilton: —
“Will never cease recommending your pianos, as
I think so highly of them. Mine has given nothing
but satisfaction.”
Miss L. LOVERING, State School, Kerang:—
“Thoroughly satisfied with the instrument.”
Mr. J. H. ROGERS, Woolocot Street, Coburg:—
“Must say that everyone who has been to my
place has nothing but praise for the piano.”
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Mr. H. J. ARMITAGE, Public School, Houghton:—
“Piano, which I have had for three years, has been
in constant use, and tone is as good as when I got
it. Pianists often remark on its great purity of
tone.”
Mrs. 11. WALKER, Wandilo, Mount Gambier:—
“Must express my satisfaction with your beauti-
ful, sweet-toned instrument.”
Mrs. C. EVERETT, Renmark:—
“Much appreciated by all who play it.”
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Mr. G. A. \CIv, Katanning:—
“Self and family are more than pleased with the
Beale High-grade Piano.”
Mr. J. A. MILLS, York:—
“Quite satisfied with piano in every way.”
Mrs. C. POWELL, Linden Villa, Stirling Street,
Perth:—
“There is not a better instrument in Perth.”
Mr. T. WARD, Wagin, Western Australia: —
“Greatly satisfied in every respect.”
Mr. W. H. BROWN, Kalgoorlie:—
“Very pleased with the instrument. Much better
than I expected.”
TASMANIA.
Mr. W. K. DRAKE, Westburg:—
“Piano has given entire satisfaction. Have had
it two years, and it has not yet needed tuning.”
Mr. HENRY NEWTON, Launceston:—
“As good as the day I bought it. Can safely re-
commend to anyone. Good pianists have pronounced
it to be a first-class instrument. Touch and tone
are perfect.”
The above are just a few of th‘e many testimonials that we are continually receiving
from users of Beale High-Grade Pianos. . •
Such success has only been obtained through our unwearying efforts to produce an
instrument of the best Quality. That we have succeeded is proved by the opinions ot
those who should know best —the users of our pianos. . , ,
To obtain this quality we have invented patent methods of construction which render
our pianos more durable, while retaining and enhancing all the musical qualities of the
great makes of the Old World. The use of an iron wrest-plank—which is part of our
patent steel tuning-system—is as great an improvement in the art of piano manufacture
as was the superseding of the old wooden-frame by the iron-frame which is used in all
modern pianos. In addition, we have introduced many other improvements such a om
method of building up the casework from cross-plies of wood which is all thoroughly
seasoned here and hence tit to withstand Australian climatic conditions much better than
timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate of Europe. In order to get the best of skilled
artisans we pay higher wages than those awarded by the Wages Boards in the various
trades We Kurally get the best artisans, and thus the best of skill. We use only the
finest of materials.
We realise that an Australian-made piano is subjected to much closer scrutiny in
Australia than any imported piano, and therefore we make—we are compelled to make —
our pianos much better than those of our competitors. But then, by making pianos in
Australia we are in a position to make them much better suited to Australian conditions.
Any competent cabinet-maker will tell you that timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate
of Europe cannot be expected to withstand Australian conditions of dry heat as well as
timber which is seasoned in this climate. This is a most important point in piano-
making, and is one good reason why so many foreign pianos develop cracked sounding-
boards, split tuning-systems and faulty casework soon after arrival in this country. But
no man can say that he ever saw a Beale piano with a cracked sounding-board. We
absolutely guarantee that the sounding-boards of the Beale Pianos will never crack in any
climate, because our special system of construction renders cracking an impossibility, at
the same time that it greatly enhances the tonal qualities of the instrument. Beale
pianos contain the only practical steel tuning-system in the world —so there can be no
question of splitting of the wrest-plank. And then our patented system of cross-plied
woodwork ensures permanence of the outside case of the pianos.
Be sure of this: the better musician you are, the more you will delight in a Beale High-grade Piano.
We have always on hand a number of good second-hand pianos, taken in part payment of
Beale Pianos. •
Call and inspect the Beale Pianos now. Inspection does not put you under any obligation
whatever. You suit yourself entirely as to whether you purchase.
If you cannot call, write for Catalogue, which we will be glad to send post free. We sell for
cash or on easiest terms. -

shave with a
stropped
blade.
You don't throw Auto Strop
blades away —
you strop them —and they last.
Simpler, too, than changing a blade —takes only
12 seconds to strop ; and the perfectly sharp
stropped blade gives a perfect shave —you can-
not strop it wrongly.
The effect of buying a self-stropping razor is to obtain shaving
satisfaction for a lifetime.
The makers of the Auto Strop rely on your recommendations.
The effect of buying a no-stropping razor is to be kept as a
“ tied house ” for blade renewals.
The makers of such razors rely on the profits of their blade-
renewal business.
The Auto Strop is the only self-stropping razor. Enough said.

Don’t forget that March 31 is the last day—positively the last
day—for exchanging your old, worn, disused and defective
Edison Records for new Edisop Amberol Records.
Do you fully realise the importance of this exchange plan? It
is extremelv unusual, and gives you an opportunity to clear out
all your old Records under decidedly advantageous terms.
Sort through your collection to-day, and put aside all the old,

22 Automatic Rifle
The novelty of its operation is one of
the fascinating features of the Win-
chester .22 Automatic Rifle. Instead of
the downward and upward motion of a
finger lever, or the backward and for-
ward thrust of a slide handle, the pull
on the trigger is the only effort required
to shoot the rifle ten times in success-
ion. The only limit to speed in firing
is the rapidity with which the trigger
can be pulled before each shot. With
this speed is coupled fine accuracy,
light weight, simple and strong con-
struction, and ease and quickness of
handling. Note the beautiful appear-
ance of the rifle. It makes an ideal
rifle for holidays, and is suitable either

“&c.”: At last we have the explanation why the
Australian drama isn’t. In The Theatre Maga-
zine, “C.M.,” stated by that magazine to be the play-
reader to J.C.W., Ltd., remarks: “If anyone should
be in a position to elucidate it, surely I am he.”
And he modestly proceeds to elucidate. For five
years he has been the official play-reader for the
Firm, and “during that time I have been astonished
at the smallness of the output of local dramatists.
There haven’t been six Australian plays submitted.”
He further elucidates that by Australian plays he
means plays typical of this country, and that they are
“about as rare as snakes in Ireland.” Then, with
massive calm, or ponderous hide, he admits that he,
the play-reader who is It for the Firm, did not recog-
nise the Australian drama when he bumped into it.
It is admitted by J.C.W. that “On Our Selection”
was submitted to his play-reader, yet the excellent
opportunity of securing it was lost. “C.M.” elucidates
that he actually got into communication with Steele
Rudd and suggested collaboration. The author replied
“You shape the play from MS. in your hands, and I
will write as you require.” Here was the ideal col-
laboration —the author of the most popular book in
Australia, and an experienced play-reader who
knows exactly what the Australian drama is and
what the Australian producer wants. What hap-
pened? “Fate and pressure of other work were
against the fulfilment of this agreement, and in the
meantime Messrs. Bailey and Duggan had completed
their clever stage adaptation, and nobody is more
delighted than I to see them succeeding as they are.”
No action for damages can lie against Fate, but what
pressure of other work could have been sufficient to
prevent “C.M.” adapting this play for the stage?
He admits that he is doubtful whether he could have
done it as well, even if he could have done it at
all. He not only let the opportunity slip for Steele
Rudd, he let it slip for his employers, and “nobody
is more delighted than he.” This naive confession
explains why so few Australian plays are submitted
to the Firm. The Australian would-be playwright
has found “C.M.” out.
“Chasuble”: I cannot find a record of Allegri’s
“Miserere” being given in Australia until it was
programmed at St. Paul’s Anglican Cathedral for
every Friday in the present Lent. It is gi ven
the Sistine Chapel in Rome every Good Friday nivtit
and those readers who have heard it there and then
will testify to its overpowering effect. Behind the
altar is Michel Angelo’s “Last Judgment,” and the
ceiling is covered with his marvellous frescoes a
peculiarity of this “Miserere” is that if you go" over
it on the piano, or hear it given straight on the
organ, it sounds feeble and insipid; its own kind of
matchless greatness only comes out when it is ren-
dered by the voices in nine parts. There is some-
thing of Allegri in Chopin’s “Marche Funebre ”
heard at a number of Australian temples in connec-
tion with Scott and the Pole, and more poignant 1
think, than Handel in “Saul.”
“Theorbo”: At a Melbourne Old Colonist shivoo last
week, an identity declared, with pardonable exaggera-
tion, that Farquharson was the greatest basso ever
known. Vistors like him and Brooke certainly did
incalculable service in Australia. Farquharson came
in 1856, with Julia Harland, Hoskins, Sherwin and
Linley Norman (conductor). Operas were given,
with Hoskins in farces. This company was alleged to
have introduced “Maritana,” though I’ve an idea
that Nellie Stewart’s mamma was previously heard
in it. Anyhow, Farquharson became of supreme value
to the Melbourne Philharmonic, shining especially in
“Elijah.” Lyster came from America in 1860, with
Lucy Escott, Rosalie Durand, Georgia Hodson,
Squires, and F. Lyster. They opened in Melbourne
with “Lucia di Lammermoor,” Farquharson having
been joyfully taken into the troupe. His great suc-
cess was as Marcel in “The Huguenots,” which ran
a month, with the same performers every night.
Beaumont joined the company later. He first
appeared in Sydney in “The Bohemian Girl.”
When a playwright strikes success in England he
stands a fair chance of being worked to death.
Edward Knoblauch, having scored a double with
“Kismet” and “Milestones,” is naturally in great
request. His latest contribution is a four : act
comedy, “The Headmaster,” written in collaboration
with a rising young author named Coleby, and pro-
duced by Cyril Maude at the Playhouse. The play
is not epoch-making. The humor is of the simple
order. For example, in one scene Maude, as the
“head,” prepares elaborately to cane two of the
school-boys who have been brought up for punish-
ment. Says the first boy to the second, “If I’d
known it was to start like this I wouldn’t have
come.” He turns out to be the wrong boy. He had
come to be “confirmed”!
“Private Boxer”: I am inclined to agree with
“Tony” (B. 20/2/’l3) that pictures are on the wane.
If the demeanor of the audiences is anything to go
by, they are, in fact, dead as mutton already. I
was much struck during recent visits to various six-
penny “palaces,” by the tomb-like silence which
prevails at the finish of any film, serious or comic.
The screen becomes black, the band breaks off with
a jerk, and then —death-like stillness. No sign of
applause; nothing but stillness. A cinematograph
claque, or sometlr'ng, is badly needed to infuse a
little ginger into the proceedings. What about
taking the raucous-voiced gentleman in off “the door”
and making him principal hand-clapper? In the
dark he would have a fair chance of being mistakoi
for a genuine patron. His presence would certainly
make the auditorium less like a morgue.
“Rawlet”: We move! The other night I saw
the Northern Territory moving-picture film (taken
specially for the Federal Government) at a show at
North Carlton. As a prelude the map of Aus-
tralia was thrown on the screen, and it was re-
ceived w 1 th enthusiastic applause. The vigor of
that spontaneous outburst made the blood race
through my veins.
The Rickards vaudeville programme has presum-
ably ceased to announce little Alberto Marini as “late
principal tenor of the Quinlan Opera Co.” Quinlan,
in a friendly way, threatened an injunction to prevent
any further such glorification of Alberto.
Quinlan has engaged Felice Lyne, the American
prima donna, for the Australian grand opera tour
which begins in Melbourne in August. Felice is the
lady who made her London dFbut at Hammerstein's
Grand Opera House, and so annoyed the boss by
accusing him of striking her with a score of “Faust
that he fired in a writ claiming £5OOO damages.

IN BANANA LAND
Maoriland is being plunged by the
Wowser crowd into the throes of a fresn
Bible-in-State schools agitation. Mean-
time in Queensland schools the thing in the
vast majority of cases is simply a dead letter,
for neither teachers nor parents have any
sympathy with it. Bananaland pedagogues
smile when the thing is mentioned —and
there the matter ceases, as far as they are
concerned. And the public, wise in this
matter, is quite content to let it cease.
“Dano”: Another instance of the debili-
tating climate of North Queensland. Arrived
in Herberton the other day, for repairs, one
Sliadforth, aged 82. He has been in the
North only a matter of 40 years, most of it
spent in the Gulf country, and already he
finds it difficult to ride more than 80 miles a
day without feeling tired. He says his
friends want him to settle down, but he is
never so happy as when he is on the track,
and calculates to put in a few more years in
the saddle before enjoying a quiet old age.
Government Botanist Bailey is just issu-
ing a fresh catalogue of Australian flora, by
way of demonstrating what a Queenslander
can do when bordering on his 90th year. Six-
and-eighty years does the old man nurnber.
and the cursed northern climate will probably
land him in the next decade, if he doesn't
mind.
Lord Chelmsford, in a recent good-bye
speech, remarked that his seven and a half
years of residence in Australia “had been
years of pure, undiluted joy.” Judging by
his late Ex.’s demeanor in Queensland during
the constitutional crisis of 1907-1908, his
“undiluted joy” at that period was a very
mixed emotion.
“T.D.Iv.”: Just met another proof that
the white man can’t live long in the North.
It was at Calliope, in a bar. Three others
were there, and their, ages totted up 248
years. One was 84, another 83, the third
merely 81. And they had a very good thirst,
too, for men who must, I suppose, have been
dead a long while.
The. ticket-scalper has spoiled his own
game in Queensland ; the Commissioner pro-
poses to follow N. S. Wales and presently
abolish return tickets except on suburban
lines. But Queensland ought to do some-
thing which N. S. Wales hasn’t done, and
make it widely known that the passenger
may not break his journey. Every day,
almost, outback N. S. Wales passengers
who drop off and spend a night on
the way—often at a “change trains
here” station —are hauled up and told
that. .their ticket ran out when they
didn’t make the run straight through.
If Evans wants to minimise the cursing
over the abolition of return tickets, he will
see to it that a big notice, “No break of
journey allowed,” hits the eye of every back-
blocker when he takes his ticket.
A couple of quaint and interesting extracts
from a Courier just 50 years old :—•
There is a weed growing wild about the more un-
frequented streets of Brisbane which has often been
voted a perfect pest. It grows about 4ft. or oft.
high, and springs up with marvellous celerity....
Mr. Hill, the director of the Botanical Gardens,
finds that this plant—the Sida retusa —yields a
beautiful fine fibre of silky texture and great
strength.... An advertisement aopears in our
columns offering £3O a ton for 3000 tons of this
fibre.
Excerpt No. 2 is, a letter from a correspond-
ent describing the three principal kinds pf
rabbits that ought to be introduced. The
writer goes on to say that he has reason to
believe that bunny is very prolific, “and that
the grasses of Queensland would be quite
sufficient for the rabbit.” That writer was
quite correct —the grasses of Bananaland
suit bunny admirably, and the birth-rate in
his family is eminently satisfactory.
Brisbane Daily Mail, forecasting a deficit
of £70,000 for the current financial year, ven-
tures on this kindly hunk of criticism : ‘‘On
the other hand, the Treasurer has a card up
m his sleeve in certain amounts which, to
reduce last year’s surplus, he transferred
from loan to revenue and charged before due
date to revenue account of 1911-12.” In
plain language, the Tory journal accuses the
Tory Treasurer of faking. And this faking
has gone on continually since Wullie Kid'ston
initiated the practice in 1909, the object
being to defeat the excellent Queensland law
which says that surpluses shall be applied to
the reduction of the State debt. Apparently
the average Treasurer will do anything rather
than get even one stitch of the country’s
clothes out of pawn.
OUT OF POCKET-MONEY.
SALVO: "I'm glad to sec you re not participating in the orgy going on inside!"
BILLO: "I'm out op this lot. My missus don’t get paid till ter-morrer.”
From the Far North
The par. (B. 6/3/’l3) anent Barambah aboriginal
settlement is a chunk of truth. Should any inquiry
be held, the conditions Binghi works under when
hired out to local cockies should be investigated.
This is a sample. One of the backbone outside
Murgon has had five or six blacks scrub-falling on his
selection. When pay-day comes round he procures
a couple of bottles of rum, to which he treats the
abos., and when they are well saturated he intro-
duces a little game of two-up, and of course succeeds
in winning back all the wages paid to the original
inhabitants. The poor food supply accounts for the
groups of half-starved cadging gins and piccaninnies
one sees about Wondai and Murgon. On a recent
Sunday the programme at the settlement included
a cricket match and five funerals. It seems as if
the old method of flour and strychnine would be, if
not more effective, at least quicker.
The ways of the land agent are various. The way
of Isles, Love and Co., of Brisbane, who have the
Boonara estate, on the Kingaroy line, in hand, was
to offer £5O in prizes for the best lucerne patches
produced on the first subdivisions. The prizes have
now been awarded by an expert, who, of course, adds
that the flats “will compare favorably with the best
lucerne lands in Queensland,” and that the people
who come along and buy the remaining 11,000 or so
acres ought to be soon riding in motor-cars.
“Kai” about a sad business :
The magisterial inquiry into the Murphy’s Creek
railway accident has been a wearying and unsatis-
factory job. Not one witness seemed to have any
idea of who was responsible. It certainly appeared
that no protection was afforded the breakdown gang
working on the debris of the first wreck. Charles
Redjnond Parkinson, one of the assistant engineers,
told the magistrate that none of the men on the
scen4 of the derailment knew of any protection. This
is hardly surprising, in view of the proven fact that
it was everybody’s job to provide protection, and
everybody’s job is nobody’s job. Probably the De-
partment, in order to furnish a scapegoat, will pick
out some poor devil of an enginedriver or pilot. It’s
an unfortunate fact that, during Charles Evans’s
reign as Commissioner, the red roll of the Queensland
railways has risen with a jump, in spite of the excel-
lent reputation he had built up for himself in the
State’s service.
Her Pearls.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
During the year 1911, 15 Javanese divers died
from diver’s paralysis and three from suffocation.
The deaths were about 11 per 100 employed.
They haul him dying from the depths that
hide
The frozen teardrops of the jealous sea;
Limply he lies his monstrous gear beside ;
The tropic sun glares down relentlessly.
That broken thing upon the lugger’s deck
Has paid for pearls that cling about her
neck!
When, Wearied quite, she cannot bear the
touch
Of precious rubbish on her slender throat,
Oh, can it be that cold ghost-fingers clutch
The gems so dearly won in seas remote?
By ev’ry risk that brings men’s schemes to
wreck,
My lady wears men’s lives about her neck !
BANANALAND.
DIVER.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 15, 1913.
My Dear Thabgomindah,—
Their Exes.’ daughter, who dropped in
from England the other day with a color in
her cheeks that has caused Envy to vibrate
upon the surrounding atmosphere, brought
with her a bale of new hats and London
gowns. On Tuesday she joined heartily in
the preparations which are being made by
an enthusiastic committee for the Oriental
ball, and has promised to sell tickets, give
advice, and do any other odd job calculated
to make the said ball roll with extra-special
energy.
Just to keep her hand in and her talents
from rusting, the Vision also offered to odd-
job for the agitated people who are struggling
with the Ilenley-on-Brisbane scheme. The
offer was gushingly accepted.
To-day, in the company of his Ex. and
Lady Macgregor, she patronised the races.
Lady Mac. wore another amethyst frock, and
the Vision was appropriately draped in a
white ninon affair, and a shady white hat
massed with stock. Whittingham, M.L.C.,
the two pretty Taylor girls, and Theo Met-
calfe and his father were included in the
party. To-night his Excellency will-eat with
the Hibernian Association, in honor of St.
Patrick, who knew more about snakes than
Australia s Morrissey. Anyhow, that’s what
a man who has had plenty of snakes told me.
Agricultural Minister White, Under-Secre-
tary Scriven, and Chief Justice Cooper on
f I'iday helped Sir William and Lady Mac. to
look over Gatton College. I haven’t heard
ot anybody being hanged or reduced in salary,
so I suppose the party was satisfied with what
it saw.
Handsome Miss Marion Darvall will change
her name to Wilkinson on the 27th of this
month. Ihree teas in her honor are threat-
ened for next week, with Mrs. David Hamil-
ton, Mrs. Cameron and Miss McSwaine as
hostesses. Another wedding is that of Miss
lemple Curtis, whose Irish eyes and brogue
captured the heart of Mr. Ernest Trafford. a
master at tne local Boys’ Grammar School.
Miss Lrost is hostessing a kitchen tea for
the colleen on Tuesday next.

that would risk the English climate.
Traffic-Manager Brown, of the Northern
section, was in Brisbane this week, to meet
his doctor son. Brown, junior, came over
surgeon on one of the big Maoriland shin
ping co.’s boats, and will move for London
per the Roscommon later on.
Fanny Durack put up another world’s
record here on Wednesday night, this one for
the 220-yards splash through fresh water
(It would have been fresher if a hogshead or
two of eau de lavande had been swilled into
it.) In addition to Fanny Durack, Mina
Wylie and little Isma Amor showed them-
selves to be wonderful swimmers. The former
beat Fanny’s record for the 100 yards breast
stroke swim by the fifth of a second ; and the
latter’s rush over the course in the 30-yards
junior championship will call for a lot of
trying before it is beaten.
The N. S. Wales swimmers seemed to enjoy
their week here. On Monday the Manly
Club gave them a day on the bay. On Tues-
day they were driven round the city in drags
and on Thursday the Q.L.A.S.A. took them for
a trip on the Lucinda, and handed over the
prizes, most of which were afterwards packed
in the departing visitors’ baggage.
Lots of Brisbane girls spent last week in
Warwick for the picnic races. Mollie Ferrier,
of Coorparoo, made her debut, and other
pretty Brisbane girls included Alice Morgan,
Gladys Pollard, Alice Flower and Freda
Pagan.
Miss Josephine Lewis, the talented daugh-
ter of Telegraph Lewis, is giving a concert
in the Exhibition Hall some time next month.
Later in the year, with her mother, she will
flit to England and the Continent, and add a
further polish to her already delightful piano
playing.
Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, our own particular
song-bird, is at present in Melbourne.
Yours affectionately,

O'


Last week the Jap steamer Shinsei Maru |
loaded a fall cargo of wheat for Tokio, this
being the first time since the Japanese were
ordered to eat wheaten bread instead of
rice, that a whole wheat cargo has been
sent from Australia to Japan. The officially-
advised change from rice flour to wheaten
flour is designed to improve the stature and
stamina of Nippon. However, the wheat
may not be gone for good: Australia will
probably get it back again—some day.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of expert««
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You mav wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR specialists.
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hafr-Orowing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
1 am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
1 reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here l et rne
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, 1 fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a lew days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as hnmriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for

Benger’s Food is specially prej
pared to build up the weakened
digestive system, and to pro-
mote a high state of bodily
nutrition while doing so.
It is the only food enabling rest and regulated
exercise to be given to the digestive functions.
Benger’s is not a predigested food, nor does
it contain dried milk. It is made with fresh milk,
and forms a dainty and delicious cream with a
delicate biscuit flavour. Patients never tire of

The record order for Australian-made goods was re-
ceived lately by H. V-. McKay, of the Sunshine Har-
vester. The order was for 800 Bft. harvesters, 700
7ft., and a lot of 6ft. machines; delivery at the rate
of 50 a week. A bank draft for £230,000 accom-
panied the order, which came from the United States.
This is a triumph for the Australian manufacturer,
for Australian wood, and for Australian workmen con-
jointly. Money talks, and on this occasion it spoke
up like a megaphone; in fact, it fairly bellowed.
“Whaffor”: The display of the resources of the
Northern Territory at the A.N.A. Exhibition in
Melbourne is absolutely the poorest on record. All
that the department can produce is shown on a shelf
3ft. wide and 30ft. long. These products of a great
land consist of a few bundles of sisal hemp, a few
saucers filled with maize, millet and Kaffir corn, a
handful of cotton, a plate of upland rice, another of
swamp rice, some osprey feathers and a few cocoa-
nuts. There is no display of buffalo horns (speci-
mens 12ft. from tip to tip are often secured) or
hides. Buffalo-raising should be a thriving industry.
Wool from the Barkly tableland, where some of the
finest in Australia has been grown, is not amongst the
exhibits. Nor is a single specimen of minerals to be
seen on the board. The Territory will be first devel-
oped through its mineral wealth, yet there is nothing
in the “Court” to expound that minerals exist
there. Here we have an immense region of country
carrying gold, copper, tin, lead, wolfram, iron and
the rarer minerals, and there is not a hint of that
wealth anywhere. The Government’s ideas are so
paltry that it displays a bagful of tropical products
grown in a garden, and some of the poorest looking
wool this scribe has ever seen. Truly, Gilruth, Thomas
and co. are making a deplorable hash of their great
trust. #
“I. R. Wynne”: The ways of the confidence man
are various. At a recent Melbourne, suburban fire
many houses were threatened, and their owners were
making frantic efforts to remove their furniture to
safer places. One of the (alleged) owners, who was
more frantic than most, offered to sell his whole lot,
as it stood, for £4 down. His offer was snapped
by a dealer; but when the gentleman started to re-
move the goods, he met with unexpected trouble —and
the real owner 1 The ability to thus collar opportun-
ity by the forelock commands my admiration ; but a
very mad dealer, who was £4 out of pocket, refused
to see the fine human points in the transaction.
* * * *
“Trotter” : I object to tips of any kind in a demo-
cratic community. It is demoralising for any citizen
to accept a tip, with its concomitant hat-touching
and fawning. At the Melbourne railway station to-
day I had to tip a red-capped luggage porter 6d. to
carry a little luggage a little way. Who could offer
a man 3d.? Yet the work was not a tenth part of
that involved in a threepenny shave. But that is not
the worst feature. Look at the women who travel in
Victoria. Porter with the red cap comes and takes
their luggage. “Thanks, oh thanks.” “Excuse me,
mum, but I don’t git paid. All I have is what pas-
sengers give me.” This may not be un-English, but
it is confoundedly non-Australian —a degrading bit
of departmental “economy.” And grossly unfair,
because the rich man gives more, and, of course, gets
better served. The porter is a public utility, and
like every other should have his fixed wage.
•+**'*
The backbone of the country, who crowds into the
shire councils and sees that his own bit of road gets
attention, has been striking quite a lot of trouble in
the N.S.W. courts lately. One of him, at Stroud,
signed a contract with the council in his brother-in-
law’s name (“apparently without that brother-in-
law’s authority,” Justice Pring added), and of
course demanded payment for the job. Nothing but
unpleasant remarks have dropped on him so far. But
up in the Blue Mountains one of the same kidney
struck worse luck—or a more persistent sort of oppo-
sition councillor. When he was found guilty of
being interested in a timber contract, the P.M.
said coldly that it would cost him £5O.
“W.”; Allow me, of your charity, a couple of
strenuous moments with the quack rupture specialist.
He swarms both in Australia and England, and he
is a heartless swindler and a danger to the public
health to boot. Wherefore I claim that the Law
should get to him without delay. There is a certain
sameness about his tactics. His device is always
claimed to do away with the necessity for a truss.
However, it is invariably a truss itself—usually a
bit of elastic webbing like a cricket belt with a lump
of wood or similar substance to fit over the rupture.
The cost, wholesale, would be under 55., but the
specialist (who always cured himself with the appli-
ance originally) charitably claims something well
up in the pounds for it. Then, as a guarantee of
good faith and an exposition of pure benevolence, he
agrees to take a sum down, which only allows him
about 300 or 400 p.c. on the cost of the contrivance,
the balance to be paid when the patient is cured.
This is called a guarantee, and referred to in glow-
ing terms by the specialist as a no-eure-no-pay trans-
action. If you write to one of the tribe, he first
sends you much literature about his particular brand
of atrocity. If you don’t reply, he intermittently
sends more, each instalment becoming more affection-
ate and impassioned. At last he begins to men-
tion that he is lying awake at night thinking of the
risks you are running. Then he offers out of sheer
human kindness to drop the price about 30 p.c.
Later, he bursts into tears, and offers further reduc-
tions. If you continue adamant, he points sadly to
all the stamps and literature he has wasted, makes
one more wild, haunting appeal, and dies away into
silence, diversified by curses. If you buy his futile
contraption, you are (1) robbed, (2) imperilled in
the important matter of your health. Why should
this noxious trade be suffered to live any longer?
“Vulcan”: The present boom in the burglary line
is responsible for some weird precautions
Sikes. I know of one coih-collector who, after plac-
ing the cash-bag beneath his bed before retiring,
arranges on an adjacent table, for all the world like
the innocent paraphernalia of a final “nip,” a tum-
bler, water and whisky. The originator’s theory is
that the teetotal Sikes is rare, and that a “doc-
tored” whisky in Sikes’s own hand is likely to be far
more lethal than a gun in the quaking hand of his
adversary.
COAST LIGHTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In a report to the Minister for Customs, Com-
mander Brewis says that various new coast lights
have already been ordered, and construction has been
commenced. The work of replacing the light at
Wilson’s Promontory by a powerful modern light
is in hand. The apparatus has arrived from, Eng-
land.—Press report.
The Text.
A glimpse of tops’ls showing—
A far, faint smudge of black
Over the world’s edge blowing—
The lone ships keep the track!
Outwards with tweeds and leather,
Homeward with hides and wool,
Through fair and ugly weather
They plug for their Father Bull.
The Raw Australian hails them
With things from field and mine;
Sometimes he humbly sails them
Over the heaving brine;
Spinning the wheel, or hauling
Wet ropes, throughout the night
He hears Australia calling
And looks for an English light!
And the Usual Sermon.
Too long have we been steering
By England’s lights afar ;
The Commonwealth is veering
Towards Cohen’s sanded bar!
But when our own lights flashing
Shall guide our people home,
Less imports will come dashing
O’er seas of Freetrade foam!

A SOUND FORMULA.
It is the fashion among certain sections of
the community to sneer at Proprietary Medi-
cines, but in many cases there is consider-
able self-interest behind the sneer. In spite
of this attempt to discredit all Proprietary
Medicines, thousands of people are using, for
instance, Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and
get just the results they are looking for, and
no amount of sneering and attempts to dis-
credit them can alter the opinion of people
who know by experience that they are using
a useful and effective medicine and at a frac-
tion of what it would cost to be running to
a doctor or chemist. These pills are based
on a sound formula, and are produced by
men of experience. There is nothing known
about pills that they do not know, there is
no ingredient that is known to be effective for
the liver, for aiding digestion and purifying
the blood, that they do not know. It is
their business to know. They not only
know these ingredients, but they know how
to compound them to secure the highest effi-
cacy. Just as any cake, omelet, or any article
of food can be hopelessly spoiled because the
cook is incompetent, and, even when given
the best material, absolutely fails to make an
eatable article; when another cook, using the
/same materials, accomplishes a result that Is
a delight. So it is in compounding drugs,
only even to a greater degree. The ingredi-
ents used in producing Dr. Morse’s Indian
Pills are of the highest standard, and they
are selected to secure the best results, and
in proportions to doubly secure ibis. Some
people are always sceptical about a proprie-
tary medicine, but does it not stand to reason
that it costs as much for machinery and
labor to produce a poor pill as a good one?
In one case satisfaction is given because the
article is good, and in the other dissatisfac-
tion because it is valueless. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a good pill in every
sense of the word, a fact that Is abundantly
proved by the thousands who continue to
use them year after year as their sole remedy
for all the little ills of life. They are pre-
pared under the best possible conditions, and
there is no better pill made in this or any
other country, for biliousness, constipation,
liver and kidney troubles and female ailments.
The care taken in the production of these
pills is illustrated by the manner in which
they are packed. Instead of being put up in
cheap wooden boxes —that absorb poisonous
and other substances—they are packed in
glass bottles, at a cost of five or six times
that of wooden boxes. The extra cost is
more than made up in the satisfaction of
knowing that the pills reach the public just
as they left the laboratory, unaffected by
moisture or climatic changes, and free from
contamination by contact with any foreign
matter. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a
purely vegetable sugar-coated medicinal pre-
paration carefully compounded by experts, and
are manufactured on the premises under the
direct supervision of the proprietors.
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE REMEDY
I OR THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN
CHILDREN AND ADULTS.
Worms, by their movements, and the in-
terruption they offer to the contents of the
bowels, generally occasion pain or uneasiness
m the abdomen, sometimes spasmodic, some-
times gnawing or biting, and not infre-
quently of a vague, indescribable character,
and yet very distressing. Sympathetic with
this is a sensation of itching at the anus and
at the nostrils, producing a disposition to
scratch the fundament and pick the nose,
which is characteristic of this affection. The
bowels are often disordered, sometimes con-
stipated or stopped, and sometimes relaxed
with occasional bloody discharges, as in
dysentery. The discharge is sometimes in
shreds or flakes, which are not infrequently
mistaken for fragments of partially-digested
food. It is not uncommon for portions of
undigested food to pass with the discharges.
The appetite is exceedingly variable; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved; one condition not infrequently al-
ternating with another. The abdomen is
often hard, swollen and tympanetic, the breath
heavy or foetid, the tongue furred, with dis-
agreeable taste, and a copious flow of saliva;
swelling of the upper lip, bleeding of the
nostrils, and disposition to grind the teeth
during sleep are other characteristic symp-
toms. The effects, however, often extend
beyond the alimentary canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced in
consequence either of the direct irritation of
the worms or of the disordered digestion which
they occasion. Among the most common of
these are nervous affections, such as fretful-
ness, irritation of temper, wakefulness, or dis-
position to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep,
sudden starting out of sleep, as if from
fright, dizziness, spasmodic movements of
the eyelids, dilated pupils, perverted vision,
temporary blindness and deafness. General
convulsions are not infrequent in children,
and symptoms strongly resembling “Water
on the Brain” have been ascribed to worms
and have ceased on thei expulsion.
Cases of St. Vitus’ dance, melancholia and
nervous diseases, and even insanity, have been
attributed, with the most apparent reason,
to the same cause. In addition to these affec-
tions may be mentioned obstinate cough,
spasm of the glottis, palpitation, languid cir-
culation, pale and yellowish skin, sunken
eyes, a livid circle about the eyelids, and a
general emaciation. This condition is often
accompanied by fever, and is then called
worm fever. Persons in apparently perfect
health may be afflicted with worms, and the
only symptoms may be periods of irritable-
ness or a constant desire for something to
eat, which may last for months until the
system breaks down, and the worms mani-
fest their presence in some other manner.
Worms have frequently been described by
medical men as “The Children’s Enemy.” Un-
doubtedly there is no greater enemy to
health, happiness and comfort of children
than the presence of worms in the stomach
and intestines; causing an indescribable irri-
tation and gnawing in the bowels, which up-
sets its victim, impairs the health, spoils the
temper, and drives the mother to distraction,
and earns for the little innocent the harsh
and undeserved reputation of being “a cross
child.”
Unfortunately many mothers fail to recog-
nise the fact that their little ones are suffer-
ing intense pain and distress, and are practi-
callv irresponsible for the outbursts of tern-
per, restlessness and peevishness, and until
some more serious symptoms appear nothing
is done to alleviate the distress. The symp-
toms of this disease are somewhat variable,
but generally they are so characteristic that
no mother need have any doubts. The best
proof of worms is worms, and if the general
conduct of the child is such as to give the
slightest suspicion, an examination of the
stools (evacuation from the bowels) will
afford ample proof.
A child who is affected with Tnread Worms
will often appear to the eye to be in an in-
different state of health. It becomes peevish
and irritable in its temper, and complains of
itching of the nose, whilst the same symp-
tom may be very prominent indeed i>
lower part of the bowel. Another point to
which the attention of mothers should be
specially directed is that the child is apt to
start in its sleep, its repose being in this
way of a disturbed nature. Note also that
many children who are in the habit of wetting
their beds do so by reason of the irritation
which these worms produce in the body, the
irritation extending to the bladder, and caus-
ing it involuntarily to part w r ith its contents.
In every heap of decaying matter there is
always to be found a nest of worms. They
breed and multiply in impure matter. And
so it is in the human system. The accumu-
lation of partially digested food in the intes-
tines, which becomes putrid when the bowels
are constipated, induces the presence of
worms. A few doses of Comstock s Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, followed by a dose or
two of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, will
disturb them in their nest and drive them
out of the system.
INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS.
TONIC PRESCRIBED FOR WELL-KNOWN
SYDNEY MAN WHO HAD LOST THIRTY
POUNDS IN WEIGHT.—WORMS THE
CAUSE.
“Some time ago I began losing weight in an
alarming manner,” writes Mr. G. B. Renton,
of 14 Sir John Young’s Crescent, Sydney, “so
much so that I went to see a doctor, who ex-
amined me and came to the conclusion it was
due to overwork and worry. I continued to
lose weight, and also suffer from peculiar in-
ternal pains. I became very anxious at the
continued loss of weight, and thinking I
might be going into a decline went to a
second doctor, who examined me thoroughly
and gave about the same opinion as the for-
mer one had done, and prescribed a tonic.
One night going home in the train I read
one of your advertisements giving symptoms
of people who have worms. The symptoms
given strongly coincided with my own, and I
determined to test the question. I accord-
ingly procured a packet of your Comstock s
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets, and took eight
tablets, and in the morning four Dr. Morse's
Indian Root Pills, and to my intense satisfac-
tion and relief passed two very large stom-
ach worms. I took them in a glass and
showed them to the doctor who had last ex-
amined me, and w r ho had prescribed the
tonic, and it is needless to say he was sur-
prised at the result. Altogether I lost thirty
pounds in two months, due to these worms,
and you may believe me I was thoroughly
alarmed, thinking I might have consumption.
I regained all this lost weight immediately I
rid my system of the worms, and am in splen-
did health at present. These are the simple
facts, which speak for themselves, and I shall
be only too pleased to confirm them to any
person who doubts their truth. You have
my permission to use this for publication.”
AFTER ONE DOSE.
WORMS EXPELLED FROM THREE
CHILDREN.
Mrs. WiUmott, .of Cooma, N.S.W.. writes: —
“Hearing about the wonderful success of your
Worm Pellets, I decided to give them a trial.
I gave my three children, Roy, Phyllis and
Horace, a dose each, as they had all the symp-
toms of worms. The pellets were taken at 6
o’clock in the morning, and at 10 o’clock
Roy had passed a stomach worm about 12
inches in length, and the other children passed
quite a number of thread worms. Since tak-
ing the Pellets the children seem greatly re-
lieved, and appear to be better in health. I
shall always recommend them to my friends,
and you may use this testimony for publica-
tion in any way you please.’’
TOO WEAK TO WALK.
DUE TO WORMS. MARVELLOUS RESULTS
OBTAINED FROM COMSTOCKS “DEAD
SHOT” WORM PELLETS.
“My little girl, now four and a half years
of age, was suffering for over four years,”
writes Mrs. F. Weiss, of 545 Crown Street.
Surry Hills, Sydney. “She appeared to have
consumption of the bowels, and I took her to
the hospital, where they prescribed powders,
which I gave her, but did not seem to do any
good. I then discovered she had Worm
Fever, and tried various medicines, which,
although they caused her to pass some worms,
only afforded temporary relief, One day I
received one of your books describing what
Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets had
done for other children, and I straightway
procured a packet. After the first dose, the
result was simply marvellous, the child pass-
ing hundreds of worms. This was four
months ago. I have since continued the
treatment, and feel sure she is now practi-
cally rid of them. Whereas previously my
daughter was very thin and that weak she
could not walk, she is now full of life and
energy, and for this I have to thank Com-
stock's ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets. You have
my permission to use this for advertising
purposes, and I shall be only too pleased to
recommend them at every opportunity.”
TWO LITTLE GIRLS.
GREATLY DISTRESSED BY THREAD
WORMS.
“My two little daughters,” writes Mrs.
Maud Tongue, of Edward Street, Charters
Towers, Queensland, “were afflicted with
thread worms; in fact, one of the children.
Laura, was literally alive with them. I had
recourse to many remedies without success,
The distressing symptoms of restlessness at
night and peevishness for a long period,
worried me considerably, until I came to try
Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets, and
I found them most effective. My children
have now recovered and enjoy their sleep and
make flesh, whereas they both previously
grew thin. I now recommend your medicine
as a sure remedy, having derived immense
benefit from its use.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a scientific preparation, prepared in the form
of a sweet that children eagerly take. They
are packed in glass tubes with full directions
in each, and are for sale by chemists and
stores generally at 2s. 9d. per packet, or six
packets for 155.; and if unable to obtain
locally will be mailed post free on receipt of

Do You Want to Increase Your Business?
IVtS:
Do you realise how easy it would be to make
“personal” calls on thousands of people who would
probably like to do business with you if they only knew
you and the good goods you could furnish them? You
can do this by sending to each one a personal type-
written letter—Oh, no, you won’t have to write them
on your typewriter, that would take too long—but you
can typewrite them on the Multigraph.
WHAT THE MULTIGRAPH IS.
It is a multiple typewriter, used to produce sales let-
ters in quantities The typewritten effect is secured by.
the use of typewriter type, a typewriter ribbon, and a
rubber platen, which produces a letter actually type-
written, not an imitation, mind you. They carry that
“personal” element, which invites a careful reading.,

ANOTHER splendid cure by Bile
Beans is that of Miss R. Baker, of
Wilton Street, off Ipswich Road, Woolloon-
gabba, Brisbane, who says: “From childhood I was
subject to biliousness. Dizziness caused my head to feel as if it were
turning round, and it would ache something fearful. Terrific pains
across my temples nearly drove me distracted. These attacks would
continue for a while, and I would become fearfully sick and retch most
violently, the sensations of which were horrible. Utter prostration
followed, after which I would sleep for hours. My skin turned sallow
and the whites of my eyes yellow. During the many years I suffered I
tried many remedies and medicines, but these all failed to give me any
relief, and I did not get better. After reading of some Bile Bean cures
I commenced a course of this grand medicine. After only a few r doses
the bilious attacks became less severe, and I found I could eat a little
food without vomiting after. This was so encouraging that I persisted
in taking Bile Beans until the biliousness was completely ended and I
was fully restored to perfect health. Now r I never suffer from drowsiness
or bilious symptoms, and find that an occasional dose of Bile Beans
certainly keeps me healthy and strong.”
THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE
The above testimony of Miss Baker is typical of the perfect curative virtues of
this sterling family medicine, in all cases of liver, stomach, digestion, and other
women’s ailments. Bile Beans have proved a never-failing remedy in all cases of
biliousness, indigestion, headache, jaundice, impure blood, dizziness, nausea,
sleeplessness, pains in the chest, pains in the back, pimples, liver chill, belching,
constipation, piles, flatulence, liver trouble, spasms, stomach trouble, digestive
disorders, skin eruptions, offensive breath, “wind,” fulness after meals, loss of
appetite, and in fact, all common family ailments. •

La Belle Dame sans Whisky.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f | HE reddest crayfish ever caught
.1 When seethed in boiling brine.
The brightest lustre Bacchus taught
To flame in oldest wine
Was never redder than the lips
She pressed so close to mine.
Let me explain. The moon was young.
The night was crisp and clear,
Warm wisps of wind were lightly flung
Across the atmosphere ;
I wore beside my beating heart
Some quantity of beer.
I saw her walking on the sea
As Peter tried to do.
Her hair, that floated wild and free,
Was either green or blue,
But exquisitely beautiful
With moonlight streaming through.
Her sandals shone like burnished gold,
But all her toes were pink
Her robe was like some dream an old
White god had dared to think,
As tender, clear and nebulous
As draughts the moonbeams drink.
She wore no wings but her white wrist
Was soft, and warm, and round.
Her circling armlets ringing kist
And made a pleasant sound,
And one grey string of flashing pearls
About her neck was bound.
With some full note of siren song
She drew me to the shore,
The beer-pulse at my heart was strong,
As I have said before,
And all the surf its whiteness spread
Along the sanded floor.
I said : “O Princess of the Moon,
Or Goddess of the Night,
The wide, free world is ours to spoon.
And I should find delight
Freely as young Endymion,
Though some might call me tight.”
We sat upon my overcoat
There on the sandv beach,
With only sea and sky to note
The thing the classics teach,
That if you catch a goddess young
She really is a peach.
The tide came crawling up the sand.
I know not how it came,
For soft as velvet was her hand.
Her lips a wild, sweet flame —
I really do not think the girl
Was specially to blame.
The large, green wave above me curled.
The white foam round me flew,
A ton of sea about me hurled
Somewhat obscured my view.
And I was wetter than a bed
Of tulips in the dew.
The maid was gone, the ocean wide
Was everywhere about.
With all the breath I had inside
I raised a fearful shout,
And some large person waded in
And kindly pulled me out.
The reddest crawfish ever caught,
As seen through ruby wine
When Bacchus at the Dago’s sought
To make one mad hour shine.
Was never redder than the lips
She pressed so close to mine.
Let me explain. The moon was brave,
The night was full of cheer.
The girl wflio came across the wave
Was all sorts of a dear.
But I object when people call
My whole adventure beer.

HOW MR. JONES WENT NORTH
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fMHE North Island of Maoriland was
| booming, and the settlement of the
country and the opening up of fresh
lines brought about an exodus of young rail-
way officers from the southern sections.
Jones was one of the first to receive notice
of transfer, and he was booked for the
Rutaniwha section. Nobody knew much
about the Rutaniwha district from a rail-
way point of view, but it was an historic
region—it had been attacked by Maoris in
the long ago, and real battles had been
fought there, and dotted over it were graves
of men who had been killed in the conquest.
Moreover, it was the North, and on the bor-
ders of the Enchanted Land where hot
springs spouted, and mud geysers bubbled,
and it was renowned for the frequency ot its
earthquakes. ~
“Anyhow r , there ought to be some excite-
ment there occasionally—this hole only
livens up once in every three, years at elec-
tion time. An earthquake is better than
stagnation,” said Jones when he read the
notice. ,
It w T as not till the time, came to depart
that Jones got even the slightest suspicion
that he was not the most popular man on
the Section. The discovery pained him
deeply. He was astounded at the ingrati-
tude of the staff generally. From the moment
he had received the notice of transfer Jones
had pictured himself departing in a blaze ot
glory, carrying a nice gold-mounted walking
cane, or some other souvenir,, suitably in-
scribed. to show' the new r friends on the
Rutaniw’lia how he had been a father to
them all down at Romahapa.
But the last days ebbed away, and there
was no hint of even a farewell dinner, trie
fellows who owed him money avoided him,
and the fellow's who had paid up all they had
borrowed were beastly distant, tor the lact
that the Labor Saver w'as a man of . afflu-
ence outside his salary made, every junior
about the place appeal to him the third
week of the month. There were two or
three fellows in the service w’ho made a
good thing by loaning money for the last
week of the pay period at 10 P er cel jb
Jones only charged five, and donated the
profits, less bad debts, to the departmental
fund for the relief of the widows and
orphans of the service. '
reason for the cold shade of in-
difference. in which he found himself was
his crankiness. He was of a combative dis-
position, and went out of his way to get
into rows, and the number he found was
astonishing. The Most Perfect Gentleman
on . Maoriland Railways said good-bye
officially the last day Jones was on duty,
which was three days before the morning of
his departure, and summed up the general
estimate of the Labor Saver pretty accu-
rately when he said :
“Well, good-bye, Mr. Jones. I hope you
will get on all right. I’m sure you will
admit that I am paying you the highest
compliment possible when I say that you
are as clever as a railway officer as you are
cranky as a man.”
When the last day dawned, and there was
still no word of any banquet or presenta-
tion, Jones determined that if they wouldn’t
give him a farewell he would present them
with one, and in the morning everyone in
the Passengers, Goods and Traffic Offices
of Romahapa received an invitation to a
farewell “blow-out” at the Imperial Hotel.
He issued these invitations in bitterness of
heart, and his intention was to give them a
first-class evening, and then fill their mouths
with ashes by means of a farewell speech
that would make their whiskers curl with
rage and shame, after which he would
ostentatiously hand each man who owed
him money a clear discharge of the lia-
bility, and cast him off as if he were a
viper.
When the staff arrived they found that
Jones, as usual, had done the thing pro-
perly. The room was draped with streamers
of red, white and green, the colors of the
railway signal flags; and over the door of
the banquet room a semaphore of white
daisies and red poppies showed “clear line”
to the tables.
When the staff saw the splendid room and
still more splendid tables with a forest of
gold tops gleaming amid flowers and silver,
its collective conscience began to smite it
hard. It felt that things were the wrong
way up, and the deeper it got into the
champagne, and other things, the meaner
it felt.
And all the while Jones smiled grimly as
he felt the little bundle of receipts pressing
into his chest.
They are a strenuous race, the Maori-
landers, and when they lay themselves out
to honor a man by eating and drinking at
his expense—well, they do honor him. It
was a great “blow out.” At 2 a.m. the
Inspector of Police, who had called in to
see what the row was about, was under the
table asleep, and Jones persuaded the Juno-
esque barmaid to sing a song that even
Wagpole, of the Goods, declared he would
never forget. She sang it in a wild boom-
ing contralto that went echoing down the
moonlit street, and amid the thunder of ap-
plause Jones seized her by the waist and
swung her up on to the table, and won her
heart right there by bis ability to do it. He
was the first man who had made her feel
she was made to be caressed. Then he
danced a Highland schottische with her
over the ruins of the oyster patties. Driver
MacGregor tootled “the pipes,” Beauty Bir-
chell clanged the barbaric piano, and the
Inspector of Police awoke and yelled “Arrah
na pogue,” whatever that might mean.
Jones balanced himself on the neck of the
heaving barmaid, and commenced his fare-
well speech, and the noise died down and
the staff smoked and sipped in silence.
“God bless you, chappies; every one of
you. I’m too drunk—not with liquor,
gentlemen, but grief at parting from such
rattling good fellows —to make a proper
speech.” (Here he felt the receipts against
his chest, and wondered vaguely what they
were. Remarks and murmurs from the
staff of “Good old Jones!” and “Bully for
you, Labor Saver!”) “I feel, chappies,
that I cannot rise to the occasion, but my
last words to you are, stick together; buck
one another up through thick and thin, be
loyal, and you’ve got the beastly public by
the neck.” (Here he kissed the barmaid,
who responded.) “I’ve been a father to
you all, chappies; and I hope you won’t
forget all I have taught you.” (Derisive
laughter from the S.M. and others.) “Ash-
bourne told me yesterday, or the day before,
or some other time, that I was the crankiest
man he’d ever known; but if he’d only
known it, it was for his own good, just to
keep him in the way he should go.” (Here
he put the other arm round the barmaid’s
neck and pulled her head on to his shoul-
der.) “There was something that I in-
tended to say to all you fellows to-night,
but it has slipped my memory, and I’m sure
I won’t remember it till I’m just going to
sleep—so you’ll have to do without it.. I
suppose there are a lot of you here to-night
I shall not see again. Some of us are sure
to be killed off before I come back to Roma-
hapa. and some of us will be in gaol, but
not many. I hope. Keep your fingers out
of the till; leave the women and horses
alone, and vou won’t be tempted to dip into
the till.” (Just here he kissed the barmaid
again, and she clung to him.) “Money is
a curse, chappies, and wine’s, a mocker, but
work well done and a girl thoroughly
hugged endureth for ever. I remember the
night I slugged Bryden on the breakaway—
I was terribly worried that we’d be in
Heaven before I could get his other eye
blackened. I don’t know what the devil I m
talking about, but good luck to you all.
Pass up the whisky.”
It took the crowd about another ten
minutes to make sure that all the bottles
were empty and no cigars had been left in
the boxes, and then they filed off hilariously.
j jater — a while later —Jones and the bar-
maid took a tearful farewell of each other,
and promised to store each other s images
in their hearts for ever.
Next morning Jones woke with a thirst,
and remembered that he had got side-tracked
overnight. After carefully destroying the re-
ceipts, he had breakfast, went to the bank,
had a few farewell drinks with various
friends, and then realised that he had only
17 minutes left to catch the express. He
flung his coat over his arm (Ins luggage had
gone down long before) and wondered if he
had time to take a final farewell of Juno at
the Imperial—somehow he felt attracted to
that girl. Then he decided that he hadn’t
time, "and he started for the station, calling

KEEP YOUR KIDNEYS WELL, AND
THEY WILL KEEP YOU WELL”
There is not a drop of pure blood in the body until
it has passed through the kidneys.
For the kidneys are the blood-filters. From birth
to death the blood is constantly flowing through them
to be filtered. The heart pumps the blood, but the
KIDNEYS purify it. They strain out the uric acid
poison and waste water, and dispose of it through the
urinary system.
Every twenty-four hours the kidneys remove
about 500 grains of urinous poison and three pints of
water from the blood. But when they are weakened
by a cold, overwork, or excess of any kind, they begin
to lose their power of separating the urine from the
blood.
Then the poisonous waste they leave in the blood
begins to make you feel heavy, dull and drowsy; you
suffer from headache, sick headache, dizziness, or
rheumatic twinges. The water left in the system
collects under the skin and causes the swellings of
dropsy. There are urinary disorders and gravel.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have a quick, sooth-
ing, tonic, and strengthening effect upon weak
kidneys, gently leading them back to health and
activity.

Backache & Kidney
Trouble.
2 LASTING CURES.
G YEARS CURED.
Mrs. F. V. Richards, “Earlswood,” Rawson Street, St.
Leonards, says: “For about twelve months I was a martyr
to kidney complaint. At times I used to cry out with the
terrible pains in my back, and I could not do my house-
work. Many a time I have had to tret a neighbor to come
and rub my back with liniment. 1 was treated by a doctor
for a considerable time, but he did me no good. 1 heard
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were curing similar
cases, and decided to try them. They gave me relief at
once, and a course of the pills perfectly cured me. It is
four years since I was cured, and I have never had any
return of the complaint. I can do my housework now
without constant torture. I cannot speak too highly of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.” IB
Two years later Mrs. Richards says:—“lt is now six
years since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me of
backache and kidney trouble, and I have had no return of
these ailments during all that time.”
9 YEARS CURED
Mrs. T. Lewis, 333 Dowling Street, Woolloomooloo,
Sydney, says: “For years I was a constant sufferer from
backache and kidney trouble. My back used to ache till 1
felt I could hardly bear it any longer. PI very movement
gave me increased pain, and I could get nothing to give me
ease. The kidney secretions w 7 ere much affected and very
irregular. One day I heard about Doan’s Backache Kidney
Kills, so I got a bottle. I commenced taking them, and in a
few days knew they were doing me good. As 1 continued
with the remedy, my health rapidly improved, and I was
soon quite free of backache and every other distressing
symptom of kidney trouble.”
Nine years later, Mrs. Lewis says: “Doan's Backache
Kidney Pills permanently cured me, for I have been free ot
backache for the last nine years.”

ip at the traffic office to take his official fare-
well of the District Traffic Manager, Then
he walked across, and climbed on board the
express as she was moving off.
Once inside, he wrapped up three half-
fcrowns to drop out at the Bay of Dogs for
young Hervey, who had been unintentionally
Omitted from the invited, so that he might
have a private blow-out on his own. At the
Bay, Plug held the white flag with the dig-
nity of Kaiser Bill, and young Hervey was
sitting on the railing trying to dislodge, with
a long pole, something which seemed to be
caught in the piles on which the station
stood. Jones flung the cash at Hervey with
a view to making him look round to wave a
farewell to. But it flew high, and it caught
Hervey under the ear, and, glancing off, fell
into the bay. Moreover, it gave Hervey such
a fright that he fell off the railing into the
putrid waters beneath, and the last Jones
saw of the bay was the figure of Plug hurry-
ing around with a rope. He learned later
by wire that Hervey was rescued before the
water poisoned him.
Thenceforward nothing exciting happened.
He had to amuse himself with books and
papers after another couple of hours, for
they were passing over sections that knew
not the Labor Saver, and who would have
regarded him as only slightly better than the
beastly public—the odious proletariat which
was always trying to reduce the salaries.
At 9.45 that night the Labor Saver found
himself walking across the rails at Port
Lynette, to where the s.s. Stormbird lay.
The flaring arc lamps shed a heliotrope-tinted
light, and once in the crowd he caught a
glimpse of a figure that reminded him of
Juno at the Imperial, and he fell to thinking
it was perhaps fortunate that he was on
his way to Rutaniwha; there were possibili-
ties of trouble about Juno. His blood went
faster as he thought of the Highland schot-
tischg of the night before.
On board the Stormbird he found that all
the cabins were occupied, but the steward
made a shake-down for him at the end of
the cabin, just over the kick of the screw.
As soon as they were clear of the Heads he
turned in, and being still tired from the
effects of the night before and the long jour-
ney, went to sleep in spite of the kick of the
screw.
He was aroused by a crash, a succession
of bumps and a shock which hurled him
nnt, of his berth on to the cabin floor.
. “What the ’s wrong, old man?” he
inquired from a reeling steward, who started
to haul lifebelts down from a rack.
“We’re on a flaming reef, and by the list
she’s got I reckon we’ll be under the water
in a quarter of an hour. Get into your
clothes and put this on before the electric
light goes out. Hurry up!”
Then he gathered up the lifebelts and ran
swiftly down the line of sleeping cabins,
from which the occupants were beginning to
peer forth and shout “waiter” and “steward”
in anguished tones.
On the deck was the trampling of many
feet. _ The foghorn burst out harsh and ear-
splitting, and the steamer gave a terrific
lurch and remained in a canting position.
I here was a roar of escaping steam, a wave
of fear seemed to sweep through the passen-
gers as the stewards came trooping along
with lanterns.
“To the deck, everybody. Take your life-
belts, Captain orders everybody to go on
deck at once. Put on your lifebelts, gentle-
men.”
The electric light trembled down, glim-
mered, and went out. The passengers went
swarming up the companion-way, and as he
passed the door of the ladies’ cabin a tall
figure in a macintosh stepped out and
grabbed Jones’s arm.
“Good Lord, what are you doing here?”
gasped the Labor Saver, as he recognised the
face and form of Juno of the Imperial, with
whom he had danced the schottische 24 hours
before.
Then he dragged her up the stairs.
“By Jove, I told those chaps last night
some of us ’d be dead before long. Strikes
me I’ve as good a chance of being the first
as anyone. What are you doing here?”
They reached the deck. Bengal lights
flared up and showed a raging ocean and
wild white horses leaping over the front part
of the steamer. The wind howled through
the rigging, and the hoi'ror of the position
froze the barmaid into silence, and she clung
to the Labor Saver’s arm in genuine womanly
terror. All the forward boats had been
smashed by the hundreds of tons of water
that had been poured over them, and they
were hoisting out the rest. Stewardesses
were fastening lifebelts on to women and
children, and telling them with trembling
lips not to be frightened. The sailors cursed
and swore as they ran the boats clear and
placed water and food on board. And ever
the ship listed over, the wind howled through
the rigging and the screech of the foghorn
drowned the voices. Staring through the
gloom and sea spume Jones could make out
dimly the ragged outline of the horrible Kai-
kouras.
The screech of the foghorn died down and
ceased, the last steam was exhausted. The
boats had been filled with women and chil-
dren, and had disappeared in the night.
“If they come back in time we may have
a chance yet, old girl. There are not more
than half a dozen women left, so you must
be included.”
“I won’t go without you. I loved you the
moment you swung me up on to that table
as though I was a little girl, and now I have
you I won’t part with you, no matter what
comes.”
“Well, I’m darned !” gasped the astounded
Jones.
“Yes, when you went away last night I
knew you liked me, and I lay and tossed and
wondered if ever I would meet another man
like you. It wasn’t worth while losing you
for the sake of a little conventionality. So
I just packed up and caught the express—
I was afraid to discover myself in case you’d
send me back. You know, dear, I’ve always
hated myself for being so big and heavy. I
would love to be like other women, not too
big and not too little; just tall enough to
be kissed comfortably and light enough to
be lifted around. Heavens! how easily you
swung me on to that table last night; it was
lovely.” And she clung to his arm in the
ecstasy of the recollection.
Away to the south, through the mist and
darkness, a light flared up. and an answer-
ing foghorn sounded faintly through the.,
gale. The sailors toiled at the building of a"
raft large enough to accommodate all who
were left, and lashed the women and children
to it, in case the ship fell from beneath them
suddenly. An hour went by and there was
no sign of the boats, and then out of the
darkness, on the top of a mountainous wave,
loomed the red funnel of a 3000-ton steamer,
which signalled that it would stand by till
morning. It dared not approach the reef any
closer in such a sea. Somehow, the presence
of that other steamer in the distance com-
forted them somewhat. Jones found a shel-
tered nook under the funnel, and having cut
Juno loose from the raft, carried her in his
arms to the sheltered spot, and sat there
with her head against his shoulder, swearing
lie would never send her away.
The wind howled through the rigging, tons
of water came pouring over the decks and
ran round them, the shattered steamer gave
a groan and a stagger occasionally; but
Juno took no heed, and half drowsed with
her arm around the neck of the only man
who had ever tossed and carried her about
as though she were small and light, as she
would have loved to be.
Then the dawn struggled through a
ragged sky; the maniacal sea went down,
and the distant steamer felt her way cauti-
ously nearer and took them all off in her
boats, and filled them with beef tea and
brandy, and landed them at Wellington in
the afternoon. The boats had reached the
shore and found their doom there, being
pounded to. fragments between the breakers
and the shingle beach.
As soon as lie got into a berth. Jones
started to think hard. It was alb very well
to promise to keep Juno with him on the
deck of a sinking steamer; it was a differ-
ent matter now they had both got another
indefinite lease of life. Yet he wanted to
keep his promise. She might be a barmaid
and she might not be a classical scholar, but
she was a handsome girl, could sing like an
organ, and she was very much in love with
him; and Jones liked being the adored party.
He was perplexed. There’d be a fearful
row, and divorce proceedings for a certainty.
He was half sorry they hadn’t got away in
the boats; the problem would have been
solved for him then.
He flung himself out of the berth, and got
into his dry clothes. Then he went down to
the bar and had a peg. As he stepped back
into the saloon, wiping his mouth, she came
towards him timidly, and put her hands on
his arm.
He looked at her critically. A frightened
look came into her face. The topaz tinted
eyes grew absolutely scared. He noticed
that her red-brown hair was half-wavy, and
the way it clustered down over her ears
pleased him. After all, her face was refined
enough. The long straight nose terminated
with very delicately curved nostrils; and
what the devil more did any man want.
“I believe you’ve been thinking bad
thoughts—you’ve been contemplating send-
ing me away. But you won’t, will you, dear ?”
“I ought to. I think I told you I am a
married man?”
“Yes, worse luck; but you also told me
you don’t live together; so that doesn't
matter. I’ve thought it all out.”
“Now, look here, Juno, just you consider
where this sort of thing will land you. I’m
an awfully bad lot; I am reallv
and all that sort of thing, vm
drink like a fish. Why, if I w as a
wouldn’t trust myself with myself as f a , 1
I could throw myself.” y as f « as
"Then you’d be a fool of a girl—l’ll

and you are health itself. Anyhow 5'
my risk.” ' ’ uiat s
“Look here, we’re standing on the edge nf
a precipice, and very little will m ,kf, -

Jones gazed at her sea-stained W-
gloomily.

She leaiied over and kissed him’wildlv
passionately, regardless of the hurrvina
stewards. • yiu s
Then Jones lifted her again, just to spo
what the sensation was like, anil somehow
(hat settled it.

Here's Luck; We Are Not Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is no good to gnash your teeth; it i s
no good to curse
When things have kind o’ jumped the
rails. They might have, been
much worse.
There's silver tailings in the clouds—or su
I’ve heard it said ;
And. it there’s not, you're still alive when
other chaps are dead.
When you’re defunct, my gloomy friend
they’ll dump you in a hole;
And never more you’ll kiss Jeanette, or pass
around the bowl,.
They’ll plunk the sods across your chest'
six feet they’ll pack them high;
And you’ll lie frozen in the dark while wi>
go marching by—
Beneath the sun-warmed sky by day, the
star-splashed sky by night,
To greet To-morrow on its way, the seasons
in (heir flight;
The buds of Spring, the thrill of girls, the
joys that never pall—
Thank God it isn't me that’s with the Dead
who miss them all.
The rain sweeps up the lamp-lit street; the
homing < ars go through—
With ankles flashing ’neath their skirts there
pass the girls who’re true
Or false. It matters not at all as long as r
they are girls—■
The falsest of them still have lips, the cold-
est trembling curls.
The night lights fade before the dawn, and
one more toast to go ;
(Oh, soft blue of tol lacco smoke above the
old pipe’s glow) :
“The men we know, the girls we love,
Life’s honey in Time's hive,
A brain to plan, an arm to work, and
The fact that we're alive.
